We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word that can give us good information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common in English.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common and distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)
 Interpretation:
 - C is not in the secret word.
 - R is in the word but in the wrong position.
 - A, N, E are not in the secret word.

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter R, but not at position 2 (since we guessed R in position 2 and it was wrong).
 - The secret word does NOT contain C, A, N, E.

 We have 5 letters excluded: C, A, N, E.

 Now, we must make a second guess that:
 - Is a valid 5-letter English word.
 - Does not contain C, A, N, E (because they are not in the word).
 - Must include R (since R is present), but not in position 2.
 - To get more information, we should try to include other common letters that haven't been tested.

 Let's think about the remaining common letters: S, T, O, I, L, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

 We also need to avoid the excluded letters: C, A, N, E.

 Since R is in the word but not at position 2, we can place R in other positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 To maximize information, we should try a word that:
  - Has R in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
  - Uses new letters that we haven't tested: S, T, O, I, L, etc.

 Potential words:

 Option 1: Start with R? But note that R must not be in position 2. So we can try R at the beginning? But wait, it might be at position 1, but we don't know.

 Since we have only negative for R in position 2, R could be in 1,3,4,5.

 However, we have not tried position 1, so let's consider words with R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Also, we must avoid using C, A, N, E.

 Try a word with R and some of these letters: S, T, O, I, L, U.

 Example words:

 - If we put R at the start: 
   Words like: ROBOT (but has O and T, which are good) -> R O B O T? But O appears twice? Not ideal? We want distinct letters for more information? 
   Actually, robot has two O's. But it might be acceptable.

   Alternative: RISKY? But S and K, and note we haven't tested S and K. However, we must avoid A, N, E, C. Risky is valid.

 - Another word: ROAST? But we know A is excluded, so cannot use ROAST because it has A.

 - How about ROILS? This has R, O, I, L, S. But note, we have O, I, L, S which are new.

 But we are missing T? Maybe we should cover T.

 Another idea: TRYST? But has Y and two T's? Also, T is common.

 Given that, let me list some words:

 - Words with R in position 1: 
   RUMPS? -> R, U, M, P, S -> all new letters. But M and P and S are less common? 
   Or RUSTY -> R, U, S, T, Y -> covers S, T, U, Y.

 - Words with R in position 3: 
   We don't know what positions might be. But we can try: FARTS -> has A, which is excluded -> invalid.

 - Position 4: 
   We haven't tested the first letter either. How about STORM? But we have to avoid excluded letters: S, T, O, R, M -> but note: R is in the word so we must use R. But ""storm"" uses S, T, O, R, M. However, note that we haven't tested O and M. But wait, we tried ""crane"" and A and E are excluded? So STORM: 
     Letters: S, T, O, R, M -> none of C, A, N, E -> valid.

   In STORM: 
     R is at position 4. Since R was in the word but not at position 2, putting R at position 4 might be good.

   Also, we get to test S at position 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, M at 5.

 - Position 5: 
   Words like: FLAIR -> but A excluded? Yes, A is excluded -> invalid.
   Words like: DRINK -> D and K? But D and K are not tested yet. However, we cannot use D? Why? We don't know that D is excluded? We haven't tested D. So DRINK: D,R,I,N,K -> has N which is excluded -> invalid.

   Instead: FOURS -> F,O,U,R,S -> R at position 4? Actually FOURS: position of R is 4? F-O-U-R-S -> R at position 4. Also, letters: F,O,U,R,S -> avoid A,E,N,C -> valid.

 However, note we already excluded A,E,N,C. So both STORM and FOURS are valid? 

 Let me choose STORM because it has common letters: S, T, O, R, M.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more vowels? Since we have only tested A and E and found them absent, the word might have O? Or I? Or U?

 Also, note: we have R. We want to try R in a different position? Since in ""crane"" it was at position 2 and that was wrong. So position 4 in STORM is different.

 But wait: in ""crane"", R was at position 2. In STORM, we put R at position 4. That's a different position.

 Also, STORM covers S, T, O, M as new letters.

 So, I'll go with STORM.

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, E (marked as ""x"")
- **Present letter**: R (marked as ""-"") is in the word but not in position 2.
- The secret word **contains R**, located at position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- No confirmed correct positions yet.

For the second guess:
- Must avoid letters C, A, N, E.
- Must include R (in position 1, 3, 4, or 5).
- Prioritize testing new common letters (S, T, O, M, L, I, etc.) to maximize information.

  - Contains R (in position 4) and avoids excluded letters.
  - Tests new common letters: S, T, O, M.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word but not in position 2.

Guess 2: STORM -> Feedback: S(✓) T(x) O(x) R(✓) M(x)
Meaning:
- S is correct and in position 1 (because it's marked with ✓).
- R is correct and in position 4 (because it's marked with ✓ and in STORM, R is at position 4).
- T, O, M are not in the word? Wait, no: T(x) means T is not in the word at all? Actually, the feedback format:
   Each letter gets:
     ✓ : in the word and in the correct position.
     - : in the word but wrong position.
     x : not in the word.

So for STORM:
- S(✓) : S is in the secret word at position 1.
- T(x) : T is NOT in the secret word.
- O(x) : O is NOT in the secret word.
- R(✓) : R is in the secret word at position 4.
- M(x) : M is NOT in the secret word.

Also from Guess 1: we know C, A, N, E, are not in the word. And R is in the word (but now we know exactly at position 4? Actually, note that R(✓) in guess 2 confirms R is at position 4. So in guess 1, R was at position 2 so it was marked '-' because it's in the word but wrong position).

Summary of known information:

- The secret word has S at position 1 and R at position 4: so the word pattern is S _ _ R _ ? 

- Excluded letters (absolutely not in the word): C, A, N, E, T, O, M (since all marked x in either guess).

- We also know from guess 1: R is present (now exactly at position 4).

- The word is 5 letters: positions 2 and 3 and 5 are unknown.

What letters have we tested so far? 
Letters that have been tested and are excluded: C, A, N, E, T, O, M.

Letters confirmed in the word: S (pos1), R (pos4).

We need to find the remaining letters for positions 2, 3, and 5.

But note: in guess 1, we had R in position 2 and it was marked '-' meaning that R was in the word but not at position 2. However, we now know R is at position 4, so that consistency.

Now, we need to make a third guess.

We must avoid the excluded letters: C, A, N, E, T, O, M.

We know the word must have 3 more letters (since positions 2,3,5) and also note that we don't know if they are repeated? But our guesses must be words without repeating if we can? Actually no rule against repeating, but typically Wordle words don't repeat? Actually, often the word is without duplicate letters? We should assume that it's without duplicates until we see evidence.

But in our case, S and R are already used, so the new letters must be distinct and not S or R? Since S and R are already in the word at positions 1 and 4? And the secret word might have more than one of a letter? But without evidence, we'll assume distinct for now.

We should consider common letters that haven't been tested: 
- Vowels: we tested A, E, O, but note U? and I? are vowels we haven't tested. 
- Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since we have S at 1 and R at 4, the word is: S [?] [?] R [?]

We need to fill positions 2,3,5 with letters that are not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, T, O, M.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should prioritize common letters: H, I, L, U, D, P, etc.

Let's try to form words that fit S?WORD?R?

But note: position 5 is also unknown.

Valid words: 
Pattern: S, _, _, R, _

We can try words like: SKIRL? -> but K and I and L? But SKIRL: S at1, K at2, I at3, R at4, L at5 -> but are K,I,L available? We haven't tested them.

But wait: we need to make sure the word is valid.

Another common word: SHIRE? -> S H I R E -> but E is excluded? E is excluded -> invalid.

SHIRK: S H I R K -> letters: S,H,I,R,K -> note R is repeated? In SHIRK, R is at position 4 again? Actually, SHIRK has S (pos1), H (pos2), I (pos3), R (pos4), K (pos5).

But we don't know if K is in the word? And H and I are new.

Also, SHIRK avoids C,A,N,E,T,O,M? Yes.

Alternatively: SHARD -> but A is excluded -> invalid.

SPUR? -> SPURR? that's 5 letters? SPURR has two R's -> but we are already having R at position 4? So SPURR would have R at position 5 too? Actually, SPURR is not a common word? More likely, SPUR is 4 letters.

Consider: SQUID? -> S Q U I D -> but Q is less common? And positions: S, Q, U, I, D -> but we have position 4 fixed to R? Not matching.

Our pattern must have R at position 4.

So we need words in the form: S _ _ R _

Possible words:

- SHIRK: as above -> S, H, I, R, K
- SHIRE: invalid because E excluded.
- SIRUP: S, I, R, U, P? But note: positions: position 2 is I, position 3 is R? Wait, but R is at position 4? So S, I, R, U, P -> R is at position 3? So pattern: S(1), I(2), R(3), U(4), P(5) -> but we need R at position 4, not position 3? So that would be S _ _ R _ meaning R must be at 4.

Thus, in SHIRK: the letters are in positions 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:R, 5:K -> matches.

Another word: SQUIRM? -> S Q U I R M -> but then R is at position 5? and M is excluded? M excluded -> invalid.

SHIRT: S H I R T -> but T is excluded -> invalid.

SURER -> S U R E R -> has E and R repeated -> invalid (E excluded anyways).

BRAWL -> B R A W L -> but A excluded -> invalid.

Therefore, limited choices? Perhaps SHIRK is a good candidate.

But note: we also haven't tested many letters. Maybe we can try a word that includes H,I,K? But what about other common letters? L? U?

Another word: SKIRR? -> meaning to move rapidly? But that's S K I R R -> two R's -> we don't know if that's acceptable? The original word might have duplicates? But so far we haven't seen duplicates in feedback? And ""brisk"" has no duplicates? We don't know. But we can avoid duplicates to get more information.

What about SPIRA? -> S P I R A -> but A excluded.

Without duplicates: SHIRK is good? Or SHILY? -> S H I L Y -> but then R? We must have R at position 4? So in SHILY, there is no R at position 4.

We must have R at position 4. So words that end with R?

Given positions: 1:S, 4:R, so we have S,X,Y,R,Z? Where X for position2, Y for position3, Z for position5.

Possible words: 
- With X Y Z such that SX Y R Z is a word.

We can list words:
  S_B_R_ -> but B in position2? Possible: SABER not valid (A excluded). SHIBR? Not a word.
  S_H_R_ -> SH?R? : SHORE? O excluded -> invalid. SHARE? A and E excluded -> invalid. SHIRE? E excluded -> invalid. SHIRK? That's SHIRK: S,H,I,R,K -> valid.

  S_L_R_ : SLURP? S L U R P -> letters: S,L,U,R,P -> positions: S(1), L(2), U(3), R(4), P(5). Valid? And avoids excluded letters? Yes: L, U, P new.

But then we have SHIRK and SLURP? Which one to choose?

Also, S_U_R_: S U R ? ? -> but pattern must have R at 4: SURGE? E excluded -> invalid. SURFS -> S U R F S -> but F is new, but S repeated? At position 5: S? That would be S U R F S -> positions: S(1),U(2),R(3),F(4),S(5) -> but we need R at position 4? Here R is at 3 -> invalid pattern.

Similarly, we must have position 4 fixed as R.

So SLURP: S(1), L(2), U(3), R(4), P(5) -> perfect.

Likewise, SKIMP -> but no R? Must have R at position 4 -> not possible? Without R? But we know R is in the word? So we must include R? Actually no: because R is already at position 4? We don't need to guess R again? But the word must have R? So our guess must have R? No: we can omit? But note the secret word has R at position 4. So if our guess does not include R at position 4, then the feedback will show x? Because it is not there? But we know it should be there? Actually, we don't need to include R? But if we include R at position 4, we get ✓? So it's best to include it to verify? Actually, since we know R is at position 4, we should include R at position 4? That way, if somehow it changes? But no, we are sure because in the previous guess R was ✓ at position 4.

But to save an opportunity? Actually, we must keep the known letters? We should fix S (1) and R (4) in our guess? Then vary the other positions.

So our next guess should have S at the beginning, R at position 4? And fill the rest with new letters.

For example: 
- Position 2: a new letter (not tested and not excluded)
- Position 3: a new letter
- Position 5: a new letter

We should pick letters that are common and we haven't tested.

We have tested: C,A,N,E,T,O,M (excluded) and R,S (included). And the guess used: C,R,A,N,E and S,T,O,R,M.

So we haven't tested: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now common letters: probably B? but less? More common: L, U, I, H?

So let's propose:

- Position 2: H (common)
- Position 3: I (vowel)
- Position 5: K? Then word: SHIRK -> S, H, I, R, K

- Or Position 2: L
- Position 3: U
- Position 5: P -> SLURP

Which word gives more coverage? Both use three new letters: SHIRK tests H,I,K; SLURP tests L,U,P.

But K is less common than U? And P is somewhat common.

We can try to cover vowel: I or U? We haven't tested U? So testing U might be valuable? Similarly, testing I (a vowel) is also valuable.

Alternatively, how about testing H and U? Or mix.

Another word: SHUR?: But SHURA? Is that a word? SHURA is not English? Or SHURT? No.

SULKY -> S U L K Y -> but then R? Position 4 is Y? But we must have R at position 4? So not.

We must include R? So choices are limited? We can consider words with R at position 4? 

Other possibilities: 
  SWIRL: S W I R L -> W,I,L new? But we have W? and I,L -> positions: S(1), W(2), I(3), R(4), L(5) -> valid? Avoids excluded: W,I,L not excluded.

So SWIRL: S,W,I,R,L -> tests W,I,L.

SWIRL is a word? Yes.

Also: SPRIG: S P R I G -> but R is at position 3? So S(1),P(2),R(3),I(4),G(5) -> but we need R at 4? Here at 3 -> invalid.

We can list:

- SHIRK: S,H,I,R,K -> tests H,I,K
- SLURP: S,L,U,R,P -> tests L,U,P
- SWIRL: S,W,I,R,L -> tests W,I,L -> note L repeated? But SWIRL? That is S, W, I, R, L.

- SKIRL: S,K,I,R,L -> tests K,I,L -> similar to SHIRK but K instead of H?

- SPARK: S,P,A,R,K -> A excluded? -> invalid.

So I think SHIRK or SWIRL or SLURP.

Let's choose SWIRL? Because it tests W, I, L? Three letters: W and L are consonants, I is vowel.

Alternatively: SHIRK? Tests H and I and K? And K less common? Which is more common? H is common? 

But we are trying to maximize the chance of hitting the word? 

Since we have no information? Maybe I prefer SHIRK? 

But the secret word might be BRISK? But B? But we haven't tested B? Actually, the secret word might be BRISK? But B we haven't tested? But note: positions: B would be at position 1? But we have S fixed at 1? So BRISK has B at1? But we have S at1? So not.

Another word: SPRY? Not 5 letters? 

Wait, we can look for the secret word? But we shouldn't? Otherwise it's cheating? 

Maybe consider: the secret word must be S??R? without C,A,N,E,T,O,M, and must have the letters we test.

We can choose a word that tests vowels? Because vowels are critical: we only know that A,E,O are not in the word? So the vowels must be I or U? Or Y? 

But note: Y is also possible? 

So testing U and I might be good? 

But in one guess, we can test one vowel? Unless we use two? 

In SLURP: U is vowel and I? No, I not tested? 
In SHIRK: I is vowel? 
In SWIRL: I is vowel? 

All have I? Only SLURP has U? 

But U is another vowel? And since O and E and A are gone, U is common? 

But I is also common? 

Perhaps we need to target position 5? Common letters at position 5? Often Y? Or consonants? 

But we can't know.

Given that, I'll choose SWIRL because it tests W and L? And W is less common? Maybe we want to eliminate common ones first? 

But note: L is more common? So testing L might be better? 

Alternatively: SHRUG? S H R U G -> R is at position 3? But we need R at position 4? So invalid.

So I choose SLURP? Because U is a vowel we haven't tested? And L and P new? 

Or SHIRK? H is common? 

I'll go with SHIRK: because it tests H and I and K? H is relatively common? 

But the pattern: S H I R K.

So guess: SHIRK

But let's verify: In guess 3, if we guess SHIRK:

- If the word has H, I, K? We'll get feedback.

But the secret word might be something else? For example, the secret word might be ""SKIMP""? But no, because we need R at 4? So SKIMP: S K I M P -> no R? Disqualify? So must have S?R?? 

Wait, actually: our pattern must have S at1 and R at4? 

Other possibilities: SWIRD? Not a word? Or SHIRE? But E excluded.

Another candidate: SIRES? But S at the beginning and R at4? S I R E S -> R is at3? and E excluded? Invalid.

So SHIRK seems a good candidate.

I'll use SHIRK.

Based on previous feedback:  
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
- **Guess 2: STORM** → S(✓), T(x), O(x), R(✓), M(x)  

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:  
1. **Confirmed Letters**:  
   - S is in position 1 (✓ from STORM).  
   - R is in position 4 (✓ from STORM).  
   → Secret word pattern: **S _ _ R _**  

2. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - From CRANE: C, A, N, E are **not in the word** (x).  
   - From STORM: T, O, M are **not in the word** (x).  
   → Total excluded: **C, A, N, E, T, O, M**.  

3. **Remaining Letters**:  
   - Untested common letters: **H, I, L, U, D, P, K** (among others).  
   - Goal: Test new letters to reveal the unknown positions (2, 3, and 5) while honoring the pattern **S _ _ R _** and avoiding excluded letters.  

4. **Word Selection**:  
   - Prioritize words with **S at 1**, **R at 4**, and untested letters in positions 2, 3, and 5.  
   - Consider common words:  
     - SHIRK (S, H, I, R, K): Tests H, I, K. H and I are common; K is less common but plausible.  
     - SLURP (S, L, U, R, P): Tests L, U, P. U is an untested vowel; L and P are common consonants.  
     - SWIRL (S, W, I, R, L): Tests W, I, L. Includes vowels (I) and common consonants.  
   - Chose **SHIRK** because:  
     - **H** and **I** are common letters (high probability of being in the word).  
     - **K** covers a moderately common ending consonant.  
     - It tests vowel **I** and consonant **H** together for efficient feedback.  

5. **Expected Outcome**:  
   - If H is in the word, feedback will indicate its position.  
   - If I is in the word, feedback will indicate if it’s in position 3 or elsewhere.  
   - K’s presence/absence will further narrow possibilities.  

<guess>shirk</guess>",shirk,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word but not in position 2.

Guess 2: STORM -> Feedback: S(✓) T(x) O(x) R(✓) M(x)
Meaning:
- S is correct and in position 1 (because it's marked with ✓).
- R is correct and in position 4 (because it's marked with ✓ and in STORM, R is at position 4).
- T, O, M are not in the word? Wait, no: T(x) means T is not in the word at all? Actually, the feedback format:
   Each letter gets:
     ✓ : in the word and in the correct position.
     - : in the word but wrong position.
     x : not in the word.

So for STORM:
- S(✓) : S is in the secret word at position 1.
- T(x) : T is NOT in the secret word.
- O(x) : O is NOT in the secret word.
- R(✓) : R is in the secret word at position 4.
- M(x) : M is NOT in the secret word.

Also from Guess 1: we know C, A, N, E, are not in the word. And R is in the word (but now we know exactly at position 4? Actually, note that R(✓) in guess 2 confirms R is at position 4. So in guess 1, R was at position 2 so it was marked '-' because it's in the word but wrong position).

Summary of known information:

- The secret word has S at position 1 and R at position 4: so the word pattern is S _ _ R _ ? 

- Excluded letters (absolutely not in the word): C, A, N, E, T, O, M (since all marked x in either guess).

- We also know from guess 1: R is present (now exactly at position 4).

- The word is 5 letters: positions 2 and 3 and 5 are unknown.

What letters have we tested so far? 
Letters that have been tested and are excluded: C, A, N, E, T, O, M.

Letters confirmed in the word: S (pos1), R (pos4).

We need to find the remaining letters for positions 2, 3, and 5.

But note: in guess 1, we had R in position 2 and it was marked '-' meaning that R was in the word but not at position 2. However, we now know R is at position 4, so that consistency.

Now, we need to make a third guess.

We must avoid the excluded letters: C, A, N, E, T, O, M.

We know the word must have 3 more letters (since positions 2,3,5) and also note that we don't know if they are repeated? But our guesses must be words without repeating if we can? Actually no rule against repeating, but typically Wordle words don't repeat? Actually, often the word is without duplicate letters? We should assume that it's without duplicates until we see evidence.

But in our case, S and R are already used, so the new letters must be distinct and not S or R? Since S and R are already in the word at positions 1 and 4? And the secret word might have more than one of a letter? But without evidence, we'll assume distinct for now.

We should consider common letters that haven't been tested: 
- Vowels: we tested A, E, O, but note U? and I? are vowels we haven't tested. 
- Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since we have S at 1 and R at 4, the word is: S [?] [?] R [?]

We need to fill positions 2,3,5 with letters that are not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, T, O, M.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should prioritize common letters: H, I, L, U, D, P, etc.

Let's try to form words that fit S?WORD?R?

But note: position 5 is also unknown.

Valid words: 
Pattern: S, _, _, R, _

We can try words like: SKIRL? -> but K and I and L? But SKIRL: S at1, K at2, I at3, R at4, L at5 -> but are K,I,L available? We haven't tested them.

But wait: we need to make sure the word is valid.

Another common word: SHIRE? -> S H I R E -> but E is excluded? E is excluded -> invalid.

SHIRK: S H I R K -> letters: S,H,I,R,K -> note R is repeated? In SHIRK, R is at position 4 again? Actually, SHIRK has S (pos1), H (pos2), I (pos3), R (pos4), K (pos5).

But we don't know if K is in the word? And H and I are new.

Also, SHIRK avoids C,A,N,E,T,O,M? Yes.

Alternatively: SHARD -> but A is excluded -> invalid.

SPUR? -> SPURR? that's 5 letters? SPURR has two R's -> but we are already having R at position 4? So SPURR would have R at position 5 too? Actually, SPURR is not a common word? More likely, SPUR is 4 letters.

Consider: SQUID? -> S Q U I D -> but Q is less common? And positions: S, Q, U, I, D -> but we have position 4 fixed to R? Not matching.

Our pattern must have R at position 4.

So we need words in the form: S _ _ R _

Possible words:

- SHIRK: as above -> S, H, I, R, K
- SHIRE: invalid because E excluded.
- SIRUP: S, I, R, U, P? But note: positions: position 2 is I, position 3 is R? Wait, but R is at position 4? So S, I, R, U, P -> R is at position 3? So pattern: S(1), I(2), R(3), U(4), P(5) -> but we need R at position 4, not position 3? So that would be S _ _ R _ meaning R must be at 4.

Thus, in SHIRK: the letters are in positions 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:R, 5:K -> matches.

Another word: SQUIRM? -> S Q U I R M -> but then R is at position 5? and M is excluded? M excluded -> invalid.

SHIRT: S H I R T -> but T is excluded -> invalid.

SURER -> S U R E R -> has E and R repeated -> invalid (E excluded anyways).

BRAWL -> B R A W L -> but A excluded -> invalid.

Therefore, limited choices? Perhaps SHIRK is a good candidate.

But note: we also haven't tested many letters. Maybe we can try a word that includes H,I,K? But what about other common letters? L? U?

Another word: SKIRR? -> meaning to move rapidly? But that's S K I R R -> two R's -> we don't know if that's acceptable? The original word might have duplicates? But so far we haven't seen duplicates in feedback? And ""brisk"" has no duplicates? We don't know. But we can avoid duplicates to get more information.

What about SPIRA? -> S P I R A -> but A excluded.

Without duplicates: SHIRK is good? Or SHILY? -> S H I L Y -> but then R? We must have R at position 4? So in SHILY, there is no R at position 4.

We must have R at position 4. So words that end with R?

Given positions: 1:S, 4:R, so we have S,X,Y,R,Z? Where X for position2, Y for position3, Z for position5.

Possible words: 
- With X Y Z such that SX Y R Z is a word.

We can list words:
  S_B_R_ -> but B in position2? Possible: SABER not valid (A excluded). SHIBR? Not a word.
  S_H_R_ -> SH?R? : SHORE? O excluded -> invalid. SHARE? A and E excluded -> invalid. SHIRE? E excluded -> invalid. SHIRK? That's SHIRK: S,H,I,R,K -> valid.

  S_L_R_ : SLURP? S L U R P -> letters: S,L,U,R,P -> positions: S(1), L(2), U(3), R(4), P(5). Valid? And avoids excluded letters? Yes: L, U, P new.

But then we have SHIRK and SLURP? Which one to choose?

Also, S_U_R_: S U R ? ? -> but pattern must have R at 4: SURGE? E excluded -> invalid. SURFS -> S U R F S -> but F is new, but S repeated? At position 5: S? That would be S U R F S -> positions: S(1),U(2),R(3),F(4),S(5) -> but we need R at position 4? Here R is at 3 -> invalid pattern.

Similarly, we must have position 4 fixed as R.

So SLURP: S(1), L(2), U(3), R(4), P(5) -> perfect.

Likewise, SKIMP -> but no R? Must have R at position 4 -> not possible? Without R? But we know R is in the word? So we must include R? Actually no: because R is already at position 4? We don't need to guess R again? But the word must have R? So our guess must have R? No: we can omit? But note the secret word has R at position 4. So if our guess does not include R at position 4, then the feedback will show x? Because it is not there? But we know it should be there? Actually, we don't need to include R? But if we include R at position 4, we get ✓? So it's best to include it to verify? Actually, since we know R is at position 4, we should include R at position 4? That way, if somehow it changes? But no, we are sure because in the previous guess R was ✓ at position 4.

But to save an opportunity? Actually, we must keep the known letters? We should fix S (1) and R (4) in our guess? Then vary the other positions.

So our next guess should have S at the beginning, R at position 4? And fill the rest with new letters.

For example: 
- Position 2: a new letter (not tested and not excluded)
- Position 3: a new letter
- Position 5: a new letter

We should pick letters that are common and we haven't tested.

We have tested: C,A,N,E,T,O,M (excluded) and R,S (included). And the guess used: C,R,A,N,E and S,T,O,R,M.

So we haven't tested: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now common letters: probably B? but less? More common: L, U, I, H?

So let's propose:

- Position 2: H (common)
- Position 3: I (vowel)
- Position 5: K? Then word: SHIRK -> S, H, I, R, K

- Or Position 2: L
- Position 3: U
- Position 5: P -> SLURP

Which word gives more coverage? Both use three new letters: SHIRK tests H,I,K; SLURP tests L,U,P.

But K is less common than U? And P is somewhat common.

We can try to cover vowel: I or U? We haven't tested U? So testing U might be valuable? Similarly, testing I (a vowel) is also valuable.

Alternatively, how about testing H and U? Or mix.

Another word: SHUR?: But SHURA? Is that a word? SHURA is not English? Or SHURT? No.

SULKY -> S U L K Y -> but then R? Position 4 is Y? But we must have R at position 4? So not.

We must include R? So choices are limited? We can consider words with R at position 4? 

Other possibilities: 
  SWIRL: S W I R L -> W,I,L new? But we have W? and I,L -> positions: S(1), W(2), I(3), R(4), L(5) -> valid? Avoids excluded: W,I,L not excluded.

So SWIRL: S,W,I,R,L -> tests W,I,L.

SWIRL is a word? Yes.

Also: SPRIG: S P R I G -> but R is at position 3? So S(1),P(2),R(3),I(4),G(5) -> but we need R at 4? Here at 3 -> invalid.

We can list:

- SHIRK: S,H,I,R,K -> tests H,I,K
- SLURP: S,L,U,R,P -> tests L,U,P
- SWIRL: S,W,I,R,L -> tests W,I,L -> note L repeated? But SWIRL? That is S, W, I, R, L.

- SKIRL: S,K,I,R,L -> tests K,I,L -> similar to SHIRK but K instead of H?

- SPARK: S,P,A,R,K -> A excluded? -> invalid.

So I think SHIRK or SWIRL or SLURP.

Let's choose SWIRL? Because it tests W, I, L? Three letters: W and L are consonants, I is vowel.

Alternatively: SHIRK? Tests H and I and K? And K less common? Which is more common? H is common? 

But we are trying to maximize the chance of hitting the word? 

Since we have no information? Maybe I prefer SHIRK? 

But the secret word might be BRISK? But B? But we haven't tested B? Actually, the secret word might be BRISK? But B we haven't tested? But note: positions: B would be at position 1? But we have S fixed at 1? So BRISK has B at1? But we have S at1? So not.

Another word: SPRY? Not 5 letters? 

Wait, we can look for the secret word? But we shouldn't? Otherwise it's cheating? 

Maybe consider: the secret word must be S??R? without C,A,N,E,T,O,M, and must have the letters we test.

We can choose a word that tests vowels? Because vowels are critical: we only know that A,E,O are not in the word? So the vowels must be I or U? Or Y? 

But note: Y is also possible? 

So testing U and I might be good? 

But in one guess, we can test one vowel? Unless we use two? 

In SLURP: U is vowel and I? No, I not tested? 
In SHIRK: I is vowel? 
In SWIRL: I is vowel? 

All have I? Only SLURP has U? 

But U is another vowel? And since O and E and A are gone, U is common? 

But I is also common? 

Perhaps we need to target position 5? Common letters at position 5? Often Y? Or consonants? 

But we can't know.

Given that, I'll choose SWIRL because it tests W and L? And W is less common? Maybe we want to eliminate common ones first? 

But note: L is more common? So testing L might be better? 

Alternatively: SHRUG? S H R U G -> R is at position 3? But we need R at position 4? So invalid.

So I choose SLURP? Because U is a vowel we haven't tested? And L and P new? 

Or SHIRK? H is common? 

I'll go with SHIRK: because it tests H and I and K? H is relatively common? 

But the pattern: S H I R K.

So guess: SHIRK

But let's verify: In guess 3, if we guess SHIRK:

- If the word has H, I, K? We'll get feedback.

But the secret word might be something else? For example, the secret word might be ""SKIMP""? But no, because we need R at 4? So SKIMP: S K I M P -> no R? Disqualify? So must have S?R?? 

Wait, actually: our pattern must have S at1 and R at4? 

Other possibilities: SWIRD? Not a word? Or SHIRE? But E excluded.

Another candidate: SIRES? But S at the beginning and R at4? S I R E S -> R is at3? and E excluded? Invalid.

So SHIRK seems a good candidate.

I'll use SHIRK.

<guess>shirk</guess>Based on previous feedback:  
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
- **Guess 2: STORM** → S(✓), T(x), O(x), R(✓), M(x)  

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:  
1. **Confirmed Letters**:  
   - S is in position 1 (✓ from STORM).  
   - R is in position 4 (✓ from STORM).  
   → Secret word pattern: **S _ _ R _**  

2. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - From CRANE: C, A, N, E are **not in the word** (x).  
   - From STORM: T, O, M are **not in the word** (x).  
   → Total excluded: **C, A, N, E, T, O, M**.  

3. **Remaining Letters**:  
   - Untested common letters: **H, I, L, U, D, P, K** (among others).  
   - Goal: Test new letters to reveal the unknown positions (2, 3, and 5) while honoring the pattern **S _ _ R _** and avoiding excluded letters.  

4. **Word Selection**:  
   - Prioritize words with **S at 1**, **R at 4**, and untested letters in positions 2, 3, and 5.  
   - Consider common words:  
     - SHIRK (S, H, I, R, K): Tests H, I, K. H and I are common; K is less common but plausible.  
     - SLURP (S, L, U, R, P): Tests L, U, P. U is an untested vowel; L and P are common consonants.  
     - SWIRL (S, W, I, R, L): Tests W, I, L. Includes vowels (I) and common consonants.  
   - Chose **SHIRK** because:  
     - **H** and **I** are common letters (high probability of being in the word).  
     - **K** covers a moderately common ending consonant.  
     - It tests vowel **I** and consonant **H** together for efficient feedback.  

5. **Expected Outcome**:  
   - If H is in the word, feedback will indicate its position.  
   - If I is in the word, feedback will indicate if it’s in position 3 or elsewhere.  
   - K’s presence/absence will further narrow possibilities.",Guess 3: shirk -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) I(✓) R(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
