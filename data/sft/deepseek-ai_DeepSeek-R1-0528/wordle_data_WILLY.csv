We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word that can give us good information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. These are common and it has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are making a second guess. The feedback for ""crane"" was: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

 Since none of these letters are present, we must avoid using any of C, R, A, N, E in our next guess.

 We need to choose a word that uses entirely different letters. Let's list some common letters that are still available. For example, we can think of letters like S, T, L, O, P, I, D, B, K, etc.

 We should aim for a word that includes other common vowels. Since A and E are out, the remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). We also need consonants.

 Let's try to form a word with distinct letters that we haven't used.

 Consider: S, T, L, O, P, I, D, M, U, B, G, H, etc.

 A good candidate might be ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T. But let's check if we can get a word with more common letters.

 Another common starting word when avoiding these letters is ""TOILS"" but note we need to avoid R,A,N,E,C and also we want distinct letters if possible to maximize information.

 However, note that we don't know if S, T, etc. are in the word. We are trying to test as many new letters as possible.

 Alternatively, we can try ""GHOUL"" but it has O and U, and G, H, L. But we might want to include more common consonants.

 Another idea: ""STILT"" - but that has T repeated? Actually, ""STILT"" has two T's. So let's avoid repeats for now.

 We can try ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T. This is a good word because it has common letters and distinct letters.

 Also, we can try ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D. Or ""POINT"": P,O,I,N,T -> but N was already used and found not present? Wait, in the first guess, we had N(x) so we cannot use N.

 Remember, we must avoid C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's choose a word that avoids these and uses new letters.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate: it uses M,O,I,S,T. All distinct and none from the first guess.

 So, we'll go with ""MOIST"".

 Our next guess: ""MOIST"".

We are making the third guess. We have feedback from two previous guesses:

1. crane -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x): None of these letters are in the secret word.
2. bovid -> B(x), O(x), V(x), I(-), D(x): This means:
   - I is in the word but not in the correct position (because I got ""-"").
   - B, O, V, D are not in the word at all.

From the feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter 'I', but it's not in the fourth position (since ""bovid"" had I in the fourth position and it was marked as wrong position).
- We must avoid letters: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, V, D.
- So, the set of forbidden letters is: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, V, D.

We also know the word has at least one 'I'. Since 'I' was in the fourth position in ""bovid"" and that was wrong, the 'I' must be in one of the positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Now, we need to think of a new word that:
- Contains 'I' in a position that is not 4 (so try positions 1,2,3, or 5) and use other letters that are not forbidden.
- Avoids the forbidden letters.

Remaining available letters: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We also need to use common letters to maximize our chances.

Possible words:

Let's try to put 'I' in different positions.

For instance:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ _
  Words: ""IGLOO"" but has double O? And O is forbidden. Or ""INKY"" but too short. Instead, ""ITCHY"" is 5 letters but already have T and H? No, we need 5 distinct? Not necessary, but we have limited tries so distinct may give more info.

Actually, we don't require distinct letters, but having distinct gives more information. However, in our situation, we don't have many new letters to test since we have already eliminated many.

Let me think: We have to avoid the forbidden list and include an 'I'.

We can try:

- Words starting with I: e.g., ""ITCHY"" has 'C' forbidden -> no. ""ICKY"" too short. ""IGAPO"" not common. More common words: ""INLAY"" -> but N is forbidden. ""INPUT"" -> N is forbidden. ""INEPT"" -> N forbidden. So we can't use N.

Therefore, avoid all forbidden letters. How about ""IMMIX"" -> not a common word. ""ISLET"": 
- I in position 1
- S, L, E? E is forbidden -> no.

E is forbidden? Yes, from first guess.

So, let's list words starting with I that don't have forbidden letters: F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,U,W,X,Y,Z.

""I"" followed by: say, ""T"". Then ""ITHER""? Not common. Or ""ITCHY"" but C forbidden.

How about ""ISSUE"": S is allowed, but S and U and E? E forbidden -> discard.

Another: ""ILLUS"" -> not common word. ""IMAGE"": G and E? E forbidden -> discard.

""INBOX"" has N and O and B -> all forbidden. 

This is difficult. Maybe avoid starting with I.

Put I in position 2: _ I _ _ _

Possible words: ""PILOT"" -> P,I,L,O,T -> O is forbidden -> discard.
""LIMIT"": L,I,M,I,T -> has two I's. But O is not present? O forbidden? Yes, but here we have L,I,M,T. Only I and M? Actually, ""LIMIT"" has letters L, I, M, T. But we have two I's? Wait, the word ""limit"" is spelled L-I-M-I-T. We can use repeated letters? The rules didn't say distinct, so repeated letters might be in the word.

But in feedback, if there are two I's and the secret word has one I, then one I might be marked and the other not. But let's avoid complexity if we can.

But we must include at least one I since we know it's present.

Another word: ""QUICK"" -> Q,U,I,C,K -> C is forbidden -> discard.

""JUMPS"" -> no I. 

Word with I in second position: e.g., ""SIXTH"" -> S,I,X,T,H -> available letters? S, X, T, H are allowed? Yes.
But ""SIXTH"" is a word? Yes. But let's check if it's common enough.

Another: ""WIMPY"" -> W,I,M,P,Y.

Or ""LISPY""? Not a word. ""FISHY"": F,I,S,H,Y -> F is allowed? Yes.

But ""FISHY"" has F,I,S,H,Y. All letters are allowed? We have F,S,H,Y available? Yes.

Similarly, ""TIPSY"": T,I,P,S,Y.

But we want to test more new letters.

We also have position 3: _ _ I _ _

Word: ""FLING"" -> L forbidden? Wait, L is not forbidden? Forbidden are: C,R,A,N,E,B,O,V,D. So L is okay? But N is forbidden -> discard. ""FLICK"" -> C forbidden. ""BLIMP"" -> B forbidden. ""SLING"" -> S,L,I,N,G -> N forbidden -> discard. ""THING"" -> H,I,N,G -> N forbidden -> discard.

Position 3: ""AXING"" -> X,I,N,G -> N forbidden. No.

Position 5: _ _ _ _ I

Word: ""TACIT"" -> T,A,C,I,T -> A,C forbidden -> discard. ""JUMPS"" no I. ""ZAPPY"" no I. ""HAPPY"" no I. ""PENWI"" not a word.

Common word ending with I: ""TAXI"" -> too short. ""ALIBI"" -> A and I, but A forbidden? Yes. ""TODDI"" not word. ""BASIJ"" not English.

Alternatively, we can use a word with I not at position 4? We know it's not at position 4.

After scanning, let's try a word with I at position 2: ""PILOT"" is forbidden because of O. ""MIGHT"": M,I,G,H,T -> has M,I,G,H,T. All available? M is available? M is not forbidden. Letters forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,B,O,V,D. So M is allowed. G is allowed? Yes. H, T allowed.

So ""MIGHT"": M, I, G, H, T.

Positions: 
1: M
2: I
3: G
4: H
5: T

We know I should not be at position 4? But in this word, I is at position 2, so that's okay.

Similarly, we could try ""FIGHT"", but F is also available? And we haven't tested F.

But ""FIGHT"" has F,I,G,H,T -> F is available.

Alternatively, we could try a word with I at position 3? Like ""DIGIT"" -> D is forbidden -> discard. ""LIGHT"": L,I,G,H,T -> L available -> yes.

But we want to include more new letters.

What about ""SIGHT"": S,I,G,H,T -> S available? Yes.

But we also have position 1: if we try, but we had difficulty.

Let me pick ""GIPSY"": G,I,P,S,Y -> available letters? G,P,S,Y are available? Yes.

""GIPSY"" is a word? Yes, meaning a Gypsy.

Letters: G, I, P, S, Y.

We know I is present, so we put it in the word. We can also try to cover multiple positions.

But note, we don't know if G, P, S, Y are present? We test them.

Alternatively, ""PITHY"": P,I,T,H,Y -> available.

But let us decide: We must avoid forbidden letters and include I.

Considered:
- ""FISHY"": F,I,S,H,Y -> positions: I at position 2? Yes.
- ""MIGHT"": M,I,G,H,T -> I at 2.
- ""SIGHT"": S,I,G,H,T -> similar.

But we also have the option to put I at position 5? Hard.

I'll go with ""MIGHT"". It introduces M,I,G,H,T. All new letters? Yes.

We get to test M, G, H, T as well.

So guess: might

But let me make sure: ""might"" is a 5-letter English word? Yes.

We note: In ""bovid"", I was in position 4 and was misplaced. Now we put I in position 2? That's fine because we don't know the correct position.

So our next guess: ""MIGHT"".

However, we might consider a word that puts I in multiple positions? But unnecessary? And we don't require it.

We also have the word ""STILL"" -> S,T,I,L,L? But we are not forbidden L? But ""STILL"" has two L's. And I is at position 3? We know I must be in some other than 4? But in this case, positions differ.

But if the word has double letters, feedback might be tricky? But it's acceptable.

To avoid complication, let's go with ""MIGHT"".

After more thought: another common word with I in position 1 is impossible because of forbidden letters? But wait, ""ITCHY"" has C? Not allowed.

""IMPEL"": E forbidden? Yes.

""IMPED"" -> E? Not allowed.

""IMPLY"": M,P,L,Y -> L and Y? Yes, but we can try ""IMPLY"". But then I at position 1? That's a possibility.

""IMPLY"": I, M, P, L, Y. All available letters? Yes.

Then we have I in position 1.

But we know that the secret word has an I, but we don't know its position. In ""bovid"", I was in position 4 and incorrect? So it must be either at 1,2,3, or 5? Now with this guess, we put I at position 1? That's okay.

Moreover, ""IMPLY"" tests different letters: M,P,L,Y? But L hasn't been tested? Yes.

Alternatively, ""slyly"" has two L's and Y? But no I? We must include I.

So, between ""MIGHT"" and ""IMPLY"", which one?

""IMPLY"" introduces L? But we can also introduce H and T? Maybe both are fine.

I think ""IMPLY"" is a good choice: 
- I in the first position? We test if it's correct? 
- New letters: M, P, L, Y.

But we also want to cover common letters? S and T are common. In ""MIGHT"", we test T? Which might be good.

But S is also common. We haven't tested S.

Let me consider ""PITHY"": P,I,T,H,Y -> includes T, and I is in position 2? Then tests P, T, H, Y.

But we don't have T in forbidden. 

A better word: ""SHIFT"": S,H,I,F,T -> avoid F? Actually, F is available? Yes, we haven't tested F. But we can.

But ""SHIFT"" has I in position 3? That might be good.

And it tests S, H, F, T? All new.

This seems to cover more ground? Since ""SHIFT"" includes I in the middle position? And new common letters S, H, F, T.

We also note that the forbidden letters include vowels we've eliminated? But we have I. The vowels: A and E are gone, O gone? So we only have I, U, and Y? But U? We haven't tested U? But we can.

But ""SHIFT"" doesn't include U? That's okay.

We'll go with ""SHIFT"" because it tests common letters.

Guess: ""shift""

But let me confirm structure: ""shift"" as in the verb? Five letters.

We have:
Position 1: S
2: H
3: I
4: F
5: T

I is in position 3? So not 4? That's a possible correct position? We don't know.

But we know from feedback that I is in the word? And in ""bovid"" I was at 4 and wrong? So if I is in 3, it might be correct? Or if it's actually in another position.

So our guess: ""SHIFT""

We'll see.

But note: in ""bovid"", the I was at position 4? So the secret word has an I but not at 4.

Therefore, testing position 3 with I is okay? Yes.

Similarly, we test new letters: S, H, F, T? And I? But we already know I is present? Yes? But we test its position? And we also test S, H, F, T.

Therefore, we go with ""shift"".

But I just realized: ""SHIFT"" has no repeated letters? Good.

So final word: shift.
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first two guesses:
- None of the letters in ""crane"" (C, R, A, N, E) are in the secret word.
- In ""bovid,"" only I (marked as '-') is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 4). Letters B, O, V, and D are absent. 
- The secret word must contain the letter I, but not in position 4. All other positions (1, 2, 3, or 5) are still possible.
- Avoid reusing forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, V, D.

For the third guess, I need a word that: 
- Includes 'I' in a new position (not position 4) to test its correct location.
- Uses only available letters from the remaining English alphabet.
- Introduces new common consonants/vowels to maximize information.

I chose **""shift""** as the next guess because:
- It places 'I' in position 3—a previously untested position, which could help identify if 'I' belongs there.
- It tests four new common letters ('S', 'H', 'F', 'T') that haven't been evaluated yet.
- All letters are distinct and not forbidden, ensuring we gather broad new information.

<guess>shift</guess>",shift,"We are making the third guess. We have feedback from two previous guesses:

1. crane -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x): None of these letters are in the secret word.
2. bovid -> B(x), O(x), V(x), I(-), D(x): This means:
   - I is in the word but not in the correct position (because I got ""-"").
   - B, O, V, D are not in the word at all.

From the feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter 'I', but it's not in the fourth position (since ""bovid"" had I in the fourth position and it was marked as wrong position).
- We must avoid letters: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, V, D.
- So, the set of forbidden letters is: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, V, D.

We also know the word has at least one 'I'. Since 'I' was in the fourth position in ""bovid"" and that was wrong, the 'I' must be in one of the positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Now, we need to think of a new word that:
- Contains 'I' in a position that is not 4 (so try positions 1,2,3, or 5) and use other letters that are not forbidden.
- Avoids the forbidden letters.

Remaining available letters: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We also need to use common letters to maximize our chances.

Possible words:

Let's try to put 'I' in different positions.

For instance:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ _
  Words: ""IGLOO"" but has double O? And O is forbidden. Or ""INKY"" but too short. Instead, ""ITCHY"" is 5 letters but already have T and H? No, we need 5 distinct? Not necessary, but we have limited tries so distinct may give more info.

Actually, we don't require distinct letters, but having distinct gives more information. However, in our situation, we don't have many new letters to test since we have already eliminated many.

Let me think: We have to avoid the forbidden list and include an 'I'.

We can try:

- Words starting with I: e.g., ""ITCHY"" has 'C' forbidden -> no. ""ICKY"" too short. ""IGAPO"" not common. More common words: ""INLAY"" -> but N is forbidden. ""INPUT"" -> N is forbidden. ""INEPT"" -> N forbidden. So we can't use N.

Therefore, avoid all forbidden letters. How about ""IMMIX"" -> not a common word. ""ISLET"": 
- I in position 1
- S, L, E? E is forbidden -> no.

E is forbidden? Yes, from first guess.

So, let's list words starting with I that don't have forbidden letters: F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,U,W,X,Y,Z.

""I"" followed by: say, ""T"". Then ""ITHER""? Not common. Or ""ITCHY"" but C forbidden.

How about ""ISSUE"": S is allowed, but S and U and E? E forbidden -> discard.

Another: ""ILLUS"" -> not common word. ""IMAGE"": G and E? E forbidden -> discard.

""INBOX"" has N and O and B -> all forbidden. 

This is difficult. Maybe avoid starting with I.

Put I in position 2: _ I _ _ _

Possible words: ""PILOT"" -> P,I,L,O,T -> O is forbidden -> discard.
""LIMIT"": L,I,M,I,T -> has two I's. But O is not present? O forbidden? Yes, but here we have L,I,M,T. Only I and M? Actually, ""LIMIT"" has letters L, I, M, T. But we have two I's? Wait, the word ""limit"" is spelled L-I-M-I-T. We can use repeated letters? The rules didn't say distinct, so repeated letters might be in the word.

But in feedback, if there are two I's and the secret word has one I, then one I might be marked and the other not. But let's avoid complexity if we can.

But we must include at least one I since we know it's present.

Another word: ""QUICK"" -> Q,U,I,C,K -> C is forbidden -> discard.

""JUMPS"" -> no I. 

Word with I in second position: e.g., ""SIXTH"" -> S,I,X,T,H -> available letters? S, X, T, H are allowed? Yes.
But ""SIXTH"" is a word? Yes. But let's check if it's common enough.

Another: ""WIMPY"" -> W,I,M,P,Y.

Or ""LISPY""? Not a word. ""FISHY"": F,I,S,H,Y -> F is allowed? Yes.

But ""FISHY"" has F,I,S,H,Y. All letters are allowed? We have F,S,H,Y available? Yes.

Similarly, ""TIPSY"": T,I,P,S,Y.

But we want to test more new letters.

We also have position 3: _ _ I _ _

Word: ""FLING"" -> L forbidden? Wait, L is not forbidden? Forbidden are: C,R,A,N,E,B,O,V,D. So L is okay? But N is forbidden -> discard. ""FLICK"" -> C forbidden. ""BLIMP"" -> B forbidden. ""SLING"" -> S,L,I,N,G -> N forbidden -> discard. ""THING"" -> H,I,N,G -> N forbidden -> discard.

Position 3: ""AXING"" -> X,I,N,G -> N forbidden. No.

Position 5: _ _ _ _ I

Word: ""TACIT"" -> T,A,C,I,T -> A,C forbidden -> discard. ""JUMPS"" no I. ""ZAPPY"" no I. ""HAPPY"" no I. ""PENWI"" not a word.

Common word ending with I: ""TAXI"" -> too short. ""ALIBI"" -> A and I, but A forbidden? Yes. ""TODDI"" not word. ""BASIJ"" not English.

Alternatively, we can use a word with I not at position 4? We know it's not at position 4.

After scanning, let's try a word with I at position 2: ""PILOT"" is forbidden because of O. ""MIGHT"": M,I,G,H,T -> has M,I,G,H,T. All available? M is available? M is not forbidden. Letters forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,B,O,V,D. So M is allowed. G is allowed? Yes. H, T allowed.

So ""MIGHT"": M, I, G, H, T.

Positions: 
1: M
2: I
3: G
4: H
5: T

We know I should not be at position 4? But in this word, I is at position 2, so that's okay.

Similarly, we could try ""FIGHT"", but F is also available? And we haven't tested F.

But ""FIGHT"" has F,I,G,H,T -> F is available.

Alternatively, we could try a word with I at position 3? Like ""DIGIT"" -> D is forbidden -> discard. ""LIGHT"": L,I,G,H,T -> L available -> yes.

But we want to include more new letters.

What about ""SIGHT"": S,I,G,H,T -> S available? Yes.

But we also have position 1: if we try, but we had difficulty.

Let me pick ""GIPSY"": G,I,P,S,Y -> available letters? G,P,S,Y are available? Yes.

""GIPSY"" is a word? Yes, meaning a Gypsy.

Letters: G, I, P, S, Y.

We know I is present, so we put it in the word. We can also try to cover multiple positions.

But note, we don't know if G, P, S, Y are present? We test them.

Alternatively, ""PITHY"": P,I,T,H,Y -> available.

But let us decide: We must avoid forbidden letters and include I.

Considered:
- ""FISHY"": F,I,S,H,Y -> positions: I at position 2? Yes.
- ""MIGHT"": M,I,G,H,T -> I at 2.
- ""SIGHT"": S,I,G,H,T -> similar.

But we also have the option to put I at position 5? Hard.

I'll go with ""MIGHT"". It introduces M,I,G,H,T. All new letters? Yes.

We get to test M, G, H, T as well.

So guess: might

But let me make sure: ""might"" is a 5-letter English word? Yes.

We note: In ""bovid"", I was in position 4 and was misplaced. Now we put I in position 2? That's fine because we don't know the correct position.

Let me consider ""PITHY"": P,I,T,H,Y -> includes T, and I is in position 2? Then tests P, T, H, Y.

But we don't have T in forbidden. 

A better word: ""SHIFT"": S,H,I,F,T -> avoid F? Actually, F is available? Yes, we haven't tested F. But we can.

But ""SHIFT"" has I in position 3? That might be good.

And it tests S, H, F, T? All new.

This seems to cover more ground? Since ""SHIFT"" includes I in the middle position? And new common letters S, H, F, T.

Guess: ""shift""

But let me confirm structure: ""shift"" as in the verb? Five letters.

We have:
Position 1: S
2: H
3: I
4: F
5: T

I is in position 3? So not 4? That's a possible correct position? We don't know.

But we know from feedback that I is in the word? And in ""bovid"" I was at 4 and wrong? So if I is in 3, it might be correct? Or if it's actually in another position.

So our guess: ""SHIFT""

We'll see.

But note: in ""bovid"", the I was at position 4? So the secret word has an I but not at 4.

Therefore, testing position 3 with I is okay? Yes.

Similarly, we test new letters: S, H, F, T? And I? But we already know I is present? Yes? But we test its position? And we also test S, H, F, T.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word that can give us good information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. These are common and it has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are making a second guess. The feedback for ""crane"" was: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

 Since none of these letters are present, we must avoid using any of C, R, A, N, E in our next guess.

 We need to choose a word that uses entirely different letters. Let's list some common letters that are still available. For example, we can think of letters like S, T, L, O, P, I, D, B, K, etc.

 We should aim for a word that includes other common vowels. Since A and E are out, the remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). We also need consonants.

 Let's try to form a word with distinct letters that we haven't used.

 Consider: S, T, L, O, P, I, D, M, U, B, G, H, etc.

 A good candidate might be ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T. But let's check if we can get a word with more common letters.

 Another common starting word when avoiding these letters is ""TOILS"" but note we need to avoid R,A,N,E,C and also we want distinct letters if possible to maximize information.

 However, note that we don't know if S, T, etc. are in the word. We are trying to test as many new letters as possible.

 Alternatively, we can try ""GHOUL"" but it has O and U, and G, H, L. But we might want to include more common consonants.

 Another idea: ""STILT"" - but that has T repeated? Actually, ""STILT"" has two T's. So let's avoid repeats for now.

 We can try ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T. This is a good word because it has common letters and distinct letters.

 Also, we can try ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D. Or ""POINT"": P,O,I,N,T -> but N was already used and found not present? Wait, in the first guess, we had N(x) so we cannot use N.

 Remember, we must avoid C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's choose a word that avoids these and uses new letters.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate: it uses M,O,I,S,T. All distinct and none from the first guess.

 So, we'll go with ""MOIST"".

 Our next guess: ""MOIST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), the secret word contains none of these letters. For the second guess, I need a word that uses entirely new letters to maximize information. I'll choose **""bovid""**—a 5-letter English word meaning a member of the cattle family—as it avoids all previously used letters and introduces new common consonants (B, V, D) and vowels (O, I). 

This guess tests:
- B (new consonant)
- O (new vowel)
- V (new consonant)
- I (new vowel)
- D (new consonant)

Guess 2: bovid -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(x) V(x) I(-) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are making the third guess. We have feedback from two previous guesses:

1. crane -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x): None of these letters are in the secret word.
2. bovid -> B(x), O(x), V(x), I(-), D(x): This means:
   - I is in the word but not in the correct position (because I got ""-"").
   - B, O, V, D are not in the word at all.

From the feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter 'I', but it's not in the fourth position (since ""bovid"" had I in the fourth position and it was marked as wrong position).
- We must avoid letters: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, V, D.
- So, the set of forbidden letters is: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, V, D.

We also know the word has at least one 'I'. Since 'I' was in the fourth position in ""bovid"" and that was wrong, the 'I' must be in one of the positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Now, we need to think of a new word that:
- Contains 'I' in a position that is not 4 (so try positions 1,2,3, or 5) and use other letters that are not forbidden.
- Avoids the forbidden letters.

Remaining available letters: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We also need to use common letters to maximize our chances.

Possible words:

Let's try to put 'I' in different positions.

For instance:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ _
  Words: ""IGLOO"" but has double O? And O is forbidden. Or ""INKY"" but too short. Instead, ""ITCHY"" is 5 letters but already have T and H? No, we need 5 distinct? Not necessary, but we have limited tries so distinct may give more info.

Actually, we don't require distinct letters, but having distinct gives more information. However, in our situation, we don't have many new letters to test since we have already eliminated many.

Let me think: We have to avoid the forbidden list and include an 'I'.

We can try:

- Words starting with I: e.g., ""ITCHY"" has 'C' forbidden -> no. ""ICKY"" too short. ""IGAPO"" not common. More common words: ""INLAY"" -> but N is forbidden. ""INPUT"" -> N is forbidden. ""INEPT"" -> N forbidden. So we can't use N.

Therefore, avoid all forbidden letters. How about ""IMMIX"" -> not a common word. ""ISLET"": 
- I in position 1
- S, L, E? E is forbidden -> no.

E is forbidden? Yes, from first guess.

So, let's list words starting with I that don't have forbidden letters: F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,U,W,X,Y,Z.

""I"" followed by: say, ""T"". Then ""ITHER""? Not common. Or ""ITCHY"" but C forbidden.

How about ""ISSUE"": S is allowed, but S and U and E? E forbidden -> discard.

Another: ""ILLUS"" -> not common word. ""IMAGE"": G and E? E forbidden -> discard.

""INBOX"" has N and O and B -> all forbidden. 

This is difficult. Maybe avoid starting with I.

Put I in position 2: _ I _ _ _

Possible words: ""PILOT"" -> P,I,L,O,T -> O is forbidden -> discard.
""LIMIT"": L,I,M,I,T -> has two I's. But O is not present? O forbidden? Yes, but here we have L,I,M,T. Only I and M? Actually, ""LIMIT"" has letters L, I, M, T. But we have two I's? Wait, the word ""limit"" is spelled L-I-M-I-T. We can use repeated letters? The rules didn't say distinct, so repeated letters might be in the word.

But in feedback, if there are two I's and the secret word has one I, then one I might be marked and the other not. But let's avoid complexity if we can.

But we must include at least one I since we know it's present.

Another word: ""QUICK"" -> Q,U,I,C,K -> C is forbidden -> discard.

""JUMPS"" -> no I. 

Word with I in second position: e.g., ""SIXTH"" -> S,I,X,T,H -> available letters? S, X, T, H are allowed? Yes.
But ""SIXTH"" is a word? Yes. But let's check if it's common enough.

Another: ""WIMPY"" -> W,I,M,P,Y.

Or ""LISPY""? Not a word. ""FISHY"": F,I,S,H,Y -> F is allowed? Yes.

But ""FISHY"" has F,I,S,H,Y. All letters are allowed? We have F,S,H,Y available? Yes.

Similarly, ""TIPSY"": T,I,P,S,Y.

But we want to test more new letters.

We also have position 3: _ _ I _ _

Word: ""FLING"" -> L forbidden? Wait, L is not forbidden? Forbidden are: C,R,A,N,E,B,O,V,D. So L is okay? But N is forbidden -> discard. ""FLICK"" -> C forbidden. ""BLIMP"" -> B forbidden. ""SLING"" -> S,L,I,N,G -> N forbidden -> discard. ""THING"" -> H,I,N,G -> N forbidden -> discard.

Position 3: ""AXING"" -> X,I,N,G -> N forbidden. No.

Position 5: _ _ _ _ I

Word: ""TACIT"" -> T,A,C,I,T -> A,C forbidden -> discard. ""JUMPS"" no I. ""ZAPPY"" no I. ""HAPPY"" no I. ""PENWI"" not a word.

Common word ending with I: ""TAXI"" -> too short. ""ALIBI"" -> A and I, but A forbidden? Yes. ""TODDI"" not word. ""BASIJ"" not English.

Alternatively, we can use a word with I not at position 4? We know it's not at position 4.

After scanning, let's try a word with I at position 2: ""PILOT"" is forbidden because of O. ""MIGHT"": M,I,G,H,T -> has M,I,G,H,T. All available? M is available? M is not forbidden. Letters forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,B,O,V,D. So M is allowed. G is allowed? Yes. H, T allowed.

So ""MIGHT"": M, I, G, H, T.

Positions: 
1: M
2: I
3: G
4: H
5: T

We know I should not be at position 4? But in this word, I is at position 2, so that's okay.

Similarly, we could try ""FIGHT"", but F is also available? And we haven't tested F.

But ""FIGHT"" has F,I,G,H,T -> F is available.

Alternatively, we could try a word with I at position 3? Like ""DIGIT"" -> D is forbidden -> discard. ""LIGHT"": L,I,G,H,T -> L available -> yes.

But we want to include more new letters.

What about ""SIGHT"": S,I,G,H,T -> S available? Yes.

But we also have position 1: if we try, but we had difficulty.

Let me pick ""GIPSY"": G,I,P,S,Y -> available letters? G,P,S,Y are available? Yes.

""GIPSY"" is a word? Yes, meaning a Gypsy.

Letters: G, I, P, S, Y.

We know I is present, so we put it in the word. We can also try to cover multiple positions.

But note, we don't know if G, P, S, Y are present? We test them.

Alternatively, ""PITHY"": P,I,T,H,Y -> available.

But let us decide: We must avoid forbidden letters and include I.

Considered:
- ""FISHY"": F,I,S,H,Y -> positions: I at position 2? Yes.
- ""MIGHT"": M,I,G,H,T -> I at 2.
- ""SIGHT"": S,I,G,H,T -> similar.

But we also have the option to put I at position 5? Hard.

I'll go with ""MIGHT"". It introduces M,I,G,H,T. All new letters? Yes.

We get to test M, G, H, T as well.

So guess: might

But let me make sure: ""might"" is a 5-letter English word? Yes.

We note: In ""bovid"", I was in position 4 and was misplaced. Now we put I in position 2? That's fine because we don't know the correct position.

So our next guess: ""MIGHT"".

However, we might consider a word that puts I in multiple positions? But unnecessary? And we don't require it.

We also have the word ""STILL"" -> S,T,I,L,L? But we are not forbidden L? But ""STILL"" has two L's. And I is at position 3? We know I must be in some other than 4? But in this case, positions differ.

But if the word has double letters, feedback might be tricky? But it's acceptable.

To avoid complication, let's go with ""MIGHT"".

After more thought: another common word with I in position 1 is impossible because of forbidden letters? But wait, ""ITCHY"" has C? Not allowed.

""IMPEL"": E forbidden? Yes.

""IMPED"" -> E? Not allowed.

""IMPLY"": M,P,L,Y -> L and Y? Yes, but we can try ""IMPLY"". But then I at position 1? That's a possibility.

""IMPLY"": I, M, P, L, Y. All available letters? Yes.

Then we have I in position 1.

But we know that the secret word has an I, but we don't know its position. In ""bovid"", I was in position 4 and incorrect? So it must be either at 1,2,3, or 5? Now with this guess, we put I at position 1? That's okay.

Moreover, ""IMPLY"" tests different letters: M,P,L,Y? But L hasn't been tested? Yes.

Alternatively, ""slyly"" has two L's and Y? But no I? We must include I.

So, between ""MIGHT"" and ""IMPLY"", which one?

""IMPLY"" introduces L? But we can also introduce H and T? Maybe both are fine.

I think ""IMPLY"" is a good choice: 
- I in the first position? We test if it's correct? 
- New letters: M, P, L, Y.

But we also want to cover common letters? S and T are common. In ""MIGHT"", we test T? Which might be good.

But S is also common. We haven't tested S.

Let me consider ""PITHY"": P,I,T,H,Y -> includes T, and I is in position 2? Then tests P, T, H, Y.

But we don't have T in forbidden. 

A better word: ""SHIFT"": S,H,I,F,T -> avoid F? Actually, F is available? Yes, we haven't tested F. But we can.

But ""SHIFT"" has I in position 3? That might be good.

And it tests S, H, F, T? All new.

This seems to cover more ground? Since ""SHIFT"" includes I in the middle position? And new common letters S, H, F, T.

We also note that the forbidden letters include vowels we've eliminated? But we have I. The vowels: A and E are gone, O gone? So we only have I, U, and Y? But U? We haven't tested U? But we can.

But ""SHIFT"" doesn't include U? That's okay.

We'll go with ""SHIFT"" because it tests common letters.

Guess: ""shift""

But let me confirm structure: ""shift"" as in the verb? Five letters.

We have:
Position 1: S
2: H
3: I
4: F
5: T

I is in position 3? So not 4? That's a possible correct position? We don't know.

But we know from feedback that I is in the word? And in ""bovid"" I was at 4 and wrong? So if I is in 3, it might be correct? Or if it's actually in another position.

So our guess: ""SHIFT""

We'll see.

But note: in ""bovid"", the I was at position 4? So the secret word has an I but not at 4.

Therefore, testing position 3 with I is okay? Yes.

Similarly, we test new letters: S, H, F, T? And I? But we already know I is present? Yes? But we test its position? And we also test S, H, F, T.

Therefore, we go with ""shift"".

But I just realized: ""SHIFT"" has no repeated letters? Good.

So final word: shift.After analyzing the feedback from the first two guesses:
- None of the letters in ""crane"" (C, R, A, N, E) are in the secret word.
- In ""bovid,"" only I (marked as '-') is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 4). Letters B, O, V, and D are absent. 
- The secret word must contain the letter I, but not in position 4. All other positions (1, 2, 3, or 5) are still possible.
- Avoid reusing forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, V, D.

For the third guess, I need a word that: 
- Includes 'I' in a new position (not position 4) to test its correct location.
- Uses only available letters from the remaining English alphabet.
- Introduces new common consonants/vowels to maximize information.

I chose **""shift""** as the next guess because:
- It places 'I' in position 3—a previously untested position, which could help identify if 'I' belongs there.
- It tests four new common letters ('S', 'H', 'F', 'T') that haven't been evaluated yet.
- All letters are distinct and not forbidden, ensuring we gather broad new information.

We are making the fourth guess. We have feedback from three previous guesses:

1. crane: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x) → None of these letters (C, R, A, N, E) are in the secret word.
2. bovid: B(x), O(x), V(x), I(-), D(x) → 
   - I is in the word but not in the correct position (specifically, not position 4 since it was guessed at 4).
   - The letters B, O, V, D are not in the word.
3. shift: S(x), H(x), I(-), F(x), T(x) →
   - I is again marked as wrong position (but since we guessed at position 3, we know that I is not at position 3 either? But note: '-' means it is in the word but in the wrong position — so from ""bovid"", I is not at 4, and from ""shift"", I is not at 3? Or could it be that the word has more than one I? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. However, both guesses had I only once.

Important: The feedback for 'I' in ""shift"" is '-' which confirms that I is in the word, but not at position 3. So now we know:
- The secret word contains the letter I, but not in position 3 or 4 (from guesses 3 and 2 respectively).
- Also, we have eliminated additional letters: S, H, F, T (all marked absent).

Therefore, the set of forbidden letters (absent) is expanded to: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, V, D, S, H, F, T.

Additionally, the only letter we know for sure that is present is I, and it must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (since position 3 and 4 are ruled out).

We need to choose a word that:
- Includes the letter I in one of positions 1, 2, or 5.
- Uses only letters that are not forbidden (so new letters: available letters include G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z, etc).
- Avoids using letters that we've already eliminated.

Moreover, we want to maximize information by testing common letters.

List of forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, V, D, S, H, F, T.

Available letters (consonants): G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z.
Available vowels: U (and we know I is present, so we can have other vowels? Note: we've used O and not used U? Also, A, E are out, so vowels: U and sometimes Y).

So, we need to form a word with I and 4 other letters from the available set.

Position for I: must be in 1,2,5 (not 3 or 4).

Let's try to form words:

Option: Put I in position 1: I _ _ _ _
Then, we need the remaining four letters from available: G,J,K,L,M,P,Q,W,X,Y,Z,U.

Words:
- ""IGLOO"" → forbidden because O is absent? And also we have duplicate O? Not allowed because O is forbidden -> discard.
- ""INKED"" → N, E forbidden -> discard.
- We need to avoid forbidden: So letters like N, R, etc are forbidden.

""I"" followed by: G, U, M, P? 
- ""IGLUS"" → not a common word? But ""iglus"" is igloos → but O forbidden? Actually, no O? I-G-L-U-S? But S is forbidden -> S absent -> discard.
- ""IMPEL"" → E forbidden -> discard.
- ""INPUT"" → N forbidden -> discard.
- ""IMMIX"" → M-I-M-I-X → double M and double I? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, it is a word? Meaning to mix? But let's avoid complex.
- ""IMPLY"" → we considered earlier? But now forbidden: S and T? Not used? In forbidden: our forbidden list doesn't have M,P,L,Y? So ""IMPLY"" is possible? But in the third guess, we already tried ""shift"" and not ""imply""? And ""IMPLY"" hasn't been tested? But: letters in ""IMPLY"": I, M, P, L, Y? All should be available? 

But wait: I is in position 1? That's acceptable? And we test M, P, L, Y.

But note: in ""shift"", we got S(x), H(x), I(-), F(x), T(x): so I is confirmed present? So we know we must include I? We are including I? Yes, in position 1? That is a new position? And we avoid forbidden letters? So ""IMPLY"" seems plausible? 

But we haven't tested M, P, L, Y? Correct.

Now, another position: Put I in position 2? _ I _ _ _
Words: ""GUILE"" → G,U,I,L,E? E forbidden -> discard.
""QUILL"" → Q,U,I,L,L → L repeated? But E isn't present? Forbidden not: Q,U,L? But we also have I? And double L? But ""QUILL"" has Q,U,I,L? Forbidden: Q,U,L? We haven't tested them? So yes? But the word? 

But also: ""JUMPS"" → J,U,M,P,S? S forbidden -> discard.
""GIVEN"" → G,I,V,E,N? V,E,N forbidden -> discard.

So position 2: word like ""GUILT"" → G,U,I,L,T? T forbidden (from ""shift"" feedback: T(x)) -> discard.

Position 5: _ _ _ _ I → we need words that end with I? In English, these are rare? Like ""TAXI"" → too short? ""ALIBI"" → A,L,I,B,I? But A forbidden? Also B forbidden -> discard.
""RAFFI"" → R,A forbidden -> discard.
""MANKI"" not common? Or ""QWERTI"" not a word? 

Therefore, it's easier to put I at position 1? 

So I choose position 1: ""IMPLY"" → I,M,P,L,Y? But we must avoid letters we've tested? And M,P,L,Y haven't been tested? So let's test them.

But note: we must check if the word exists: ""IMPLY"" is valid.

Alternatively, we can try ""INKED""? But N,K,E? Forbidden letters? E and N forbidden? Discard.

Another word: ""ICILY"" → I,C,Y,L? But C forbidden -> discard.

""IGLU"" → four letters? Not five.

""IMAM"" → four letters.

So ""IMPLY"" seems a good candidate.

However, let me think of other options? 

Word with I at position 2: ""GUPPY""? G,U,P,P,Y? U? And double P? No I? Then not? We must include I? So position must have I at 2.

""GUILE"" forbidden? Then ""QUIPH""? not a word. ""BUILT?"" B forbidden -> discard.

Therefore, ""IMPLY"" is a strong candidate.

But we also need to test if I is correctly placed? We don't know? But we try.

Another idea: include 'U'? Since we haven't tested vowels? Only I? We haven't tested U.

So word: ""QUICK"" → Q,U,I,C,K? C forbidden -> discard.
""JUICY"" → J,U,I,C,Y? C forbidden -> discard.
""GUISE"" → G,U,I,S,E? S and E forbidden -> discard.

So U may be hard? And we haven't tested? But no good word comes.

Perhaps ""PIOUS"" → P,I,O,U,S? O and S forbidden -> discard.

So back to ""IMPLY"".

But we also have the issue of whether the word might have duplicate letters? We avoid for maximum information.

Therefore, we guess ""IMPLY"".

But note: in ""IMPLY"", I is at position 1? And we know the I is present? So we test: if the I is correct? Or wrong? And test M,P,L,Y.

So word: imply

Let's write it: I M P L Y

Now, feedback might tell us:

- If I is correct? Position 1? Then feedback for I: ✓
- Otherwise, if '-' (in word but not here) or 'x'? But wait, we know I is in the word? So it should not be 'x', but '-'? 

But if 'x' would be inconsistent? But actually, if we put I in position 1 and the secret word has only one I? Then if I at position 1 is wrong? Then it should be '-'? Unless there is a duplicate? But we don't know.

But anyway, we proceed.

So guess: imply

But let me verify: is there another word that might be better? For example, with U? 

Word: ""MUCID"" → M,U,C,I,D? C and D forbidden -> discard.
""USQUE"" → not common? 

I think ""IMPLY"" is the best option.

We'll guess ""IMPLY"".

But note: our goal is to find the secret word? We have 6 tries? So we are on try 4? So we have 4,5,6? Still three? So we can.

Thus, we return ""IMPLY"".
</think>
For the fourth guess, we have:
- Confirmed letters: Only 'I' is known to be in the secret word (from Guess 2 and Guess 3), but it is not in position 3 or 4 (ruled out by feedback).
- Forbidden letters (absent): C, R, A, N, E, B, O, V, D, S, H, F, T (total 13 letters).
- Available letters: G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.
- Valid positions for 'I': 1, 2, or 5 (positions 3 and 4 are eliminated).

I chose **""IMPLY""** as the next guess because:
- It places 'I' in position 1 (a new position to test).
- It introduces four new, common letters (M, P, L, Y), maximizing potential information.
- It uses only untested letters from the available set, ensuring no reuse of forbidden letters.
- The word ""IMPLY"" is a valid English word and aligns with strategy to narrow down positional placements for 'I' and expand tested characters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word that can give us good information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. These are common and it has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are making a second guess. The feedback for ""crane"" was: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

 Since none of these letters are present, we must avoid using any of C, R, A, N, E in our next guess.

 We need to choose a word that uses entirely different letters. Let's list some common letters that are still available. For example, we can think of letters like S, T, L, O, P, I, D, B, K, etc.

 We should aim for a word that includes other common vowels. Since A and E are out, the remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). We also need consonants.

 Let's try to form a word with distinct letters that we haven't used.

 Consider: S, T, L, O, P, I, D, M, U, B, G, H, etc.

 A good candidate might be ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T. But let's check if we can get a word with more common letters.

 Another common starting word when avoiding these letters is ""TOILS"" but note we need to avoid R,A,N,E,C and also we want distinct letters if possible to maximize information.

 However, note that we don't know if S, T, etc. are in the word. We are trying to test as many new letters as possible.

 Alternatively, we can try ""GHOUL"" but it has O and U, and G, H, L. But we might want to include more common consonants.

 Another idea: ""STILT"" - but that has T repeated? Actually, ""STILT"" has two T's. So let's avoid repeats for now.

 We can try ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T. This is a good word because it has common letters and distinct letters.

 Also, we can try ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D. Or ""POINT"": P,O,I,N,T -> but N was already used and found not present? Wait, in the first guess, we had N(x) so we cannot use N.

 Remember, we must avoid C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's choose a word that avoids these and uses new letters.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate: it uses M,O,I,S,T. All distinct and none from the first guess.

 So, we'll go with ""MOIST"".

 Our next guess: ""MOIST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), the secret word contains none of these letters. For the second guess, I need a word that uses entirely new letters to maximize information. I'll choose **""bovid""**—a 5-letter English word meaning a member of the cattle family—as it avoids all previously used letters and introduces new common consonants (B, V, D) and vowels (O, I). 

This guess tests:
- B (new consonant)
- O (new vowel)
- V (new consonant)
- I (new vowel)
- D (new consonant)

<guess>bovid</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: bovid -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(x) V(x) I(-) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are making the third guess. We have feedback from two previous guesses:

1. crane -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x): None of these letters are in the secret word.
2. bovid -> B(x), O(x), V(x), I(-), D(x): This means:
   - I is in the word but not in the correct position (because I got ""-"").
   - B, O, V, D are not in the word at all.

From the feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter 'I', but it's not in the fourth position (since ""bovid"" had I in the fourth position and it was marked as wrong position).
- We must avoid letters: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, V, D.
- So, the set of forbidden letters is: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, V, D.

We also know the word has at least one 'I'. Since 'I' was in the fourth position in ""bovid"" and that was wrong, the 'I' must be in one of the positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Now, we need to think of a new word that:
- Contains 'I' in a position that is not 4 (so try positions 1,2,3, or 5) and use other letters that are not forbidden.
- Avoids the forbidden letters.

Remaining available letters: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We also need to use common letters to maximize our chances.

Possible words:

Let's try to put 'I' in different positions.

For instance:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ _
  Words: ""IGLOO"" but has double O? And O is forbidden. Or ""INKY"" but too short. Instead, ""ITCHY"" is 5 letters but already have T and H? No, we need 5 distinct? Not necessary, but we have limited tries so distinct may give more info.

Actually, we don't require distinct letters, but having distinct gives more information. However, in our situation, we don't have many new letters to test since we have already eliminated many.

Let me think: We have to avoid the forbidden list and include an 'I'.

We can try:

- Words starting with I: e.g., ""ITCHY"" has 'C' forbidden -> no. ""ICKY"" too short. ""IGAPO"" not common. More common words: ""INLAY"" -> but N is forbidden. ""INPUT"" -> N is forbidden. ""INEPT"" -> N forbidden. So we can't use N.

Therefore, avoid all forbidden letters. How about ""IMMIX"" -> not a common word. ""ISLET"": 
- I in position 1
- S, L, E? E is forbidden -> no.

E is forbidden? Yes, from first guess.

So, let's list words starting with I that don't have forbidden letters: F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,U,W,X,Y,Z.

""I"" followed by: say, ""T"". Then ""ITHER""? Not common. Or ""ITCHY"" but C forbidden.

How about ""ISSUE"": S is allowed, but S and U and E? E forbidden -> discard.

Another: ""ILLUS"" -> not common word. ""IMAGE"": G and E? E forbidden -> discard.

""INBOX"" has N and O and B -> all forbidden. 

This is difficult. Maybe avoid starting with I.

Put I in position 2: _ I _ _ _

Possible words: ""PILOT"" -> P,I,L,O,T -> O is forbidden -> discard.
""LIMIT"": L,I,M,I,T -> has two I's. But O is not present? O forbidden? Yes, but here we have L,I,M,T. Only I and M? Actually, ""LIMIT"" has letters L, I, M, T. But we have two I's? Wait, the word ""limit"" is spelled L-I-M-I-T. We can use repeated letters? The rules didn't say distinct, so repeated letters might be in the word.

But in feedback, if there are two I's and the secret word has one I, then one I might be marked and the other not. But let's avoid complexity if we can.

But we must include at least one I since we know it's present.

Another word: ""QUICK"" -> Q,U,I,C,K -> C is forbidden -> discard.

""JUMPS"" -> no I. 

Word with I in second position: e.g., ""SIXTH"" -> S,I,X,T,H -> available letters? S, X, T, H are allowed? Yes.
But ""SIXTH"" is a word? Yes. But let's check if it's common enough.

Another: ""WIMPY"" -> W,I,M,P,Y.

Or ""LISPY""? Not a word. ""FISHY"": F,I,S,H,Y -> F is allowed? Yes.

But ""FISHY"" has F,I,S,H,Y. All letters are allowed? We have F,S,H,Y available? Yes.

Similarly, ""TIPSY"": T,I,P,S,Y.

But we want to test more new letters.

We also have position 3: _ _ I _ _

Word: ""FLING"" -> L forbidden? Wait, L is not forbidden? Forbidden are: C,R,A,N,E,B,O,V,D. So L is okay? But N is forbidden -> discard. ""FLICK"" -> C forbidden. ""BLIMP"" -> B forbidden. ""SLING"" -> S,L,I,N,G -> N forbidden -> discard. ""THING"" -> H,I,N,G -> N forbidden -> discard.

Position 3: ""AXING"" -> X,I,N,G -> N forbidden. No.

Position 5: _ _ _ _ I

Word: ""TACIT"" -> T,A,C,I,T -> A,C forbidden -> discard. ""JUMPS"" no I. ""ZAPPY"" no I. ""HAPPY"" no I. ""PENWI"" not a word.

Common word ending with I: ""TAXI"" -> too short. ""ALIBI"" -> A and I, but A forbidden? Yes. ""TODDI"" not word. ""BASIJ"" not English.

Alternatively, we can use a word with I not at position 4? We know it's not at position 4.

After scanning, let's try a word with I at position 2: ""PILOT"" is forbidden because of O. ""MIGHT"": M,I,G,H,T -> has M,I,G,H,T. All available? M is available? M is not forbidden. Letters forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,B,O,V,D. So M is allowed. G is allowed? Yes. H, T allowed.

So ""MIGHT"": M, I, G, H, T.

Positions: 
1: M
2: I
3: G
4: H
5: T

We know I should not be at position 4? But in this word, I is at position 2, so that's okay.

Similarly, we could try ""FIGHT"", but F is also available? And we haven't tested F.

But ""FIGHT"" has F,I,G,H,T -> F is available.

Alternatively, we could try a word with I at position 3? Like ""DIGIT"" -> D is forbidden -> discard. ""LIGHT"": L,I,G,H,T -> L available -> yes.

But we want to include more new letters.

What about ""SIGHT"": S,I,G,H,T -> S available? Yes.

But we also have position 1: if we try, but we had difficulty.

Let me pick ""GIPSY"": G,I,P,S,Y -> available letters? G,P,S,Y are available? Yes.

""GIPSY"" is a word? Yes, meaning a Gypsy.

Letters: G, I, P, S, Y.

We know I is present, so we put it in the word. We can also try to cover multiple positions.

But note, we don't know if G, P, S, Y are present? We test them.

Alternatively, ""PITHY"": P,I,T,H,Y -> available.

But let us decide: We must avoid forbidden letters and include I.

Considered:
- ""FISHY"": F,I,S,H,Y -> positions: I at position 2? Yes.
- ""MIGHT"": M,I,G,H,T -> I at 2.
- ""SIGHT"": S,I,G,H,T -> similar.

But we also have the option to put I at position 5? Hard.

I'll go with ""MIGHT"". It introduces M,I,G,H,T. All new letters? Yes.

We get to test M, G, H, T as well.

So guess: might

But let me make sure: ""might"" is a 5-letter English word? Yes.

We note: In ""bovid"", I was in position 4 and was misplaced. Now we put I in position 2? That's fine because we don't know the correct position.

So our next guess: ""MIGHT"".

However, we might consider a word that puts I in multiple positions? But unnecessary? And we don't require it.

We also have the word ""STILL"" -> S,T,I,L,L? But we are not forbidden L? But ""STILL"" has two L's. And I is at position 3? We know I must be in some other than 4? But in this case, positions differ.

But if the word has double letters, feedback might be tricky? But it's acceptable.

To avoid complication, let's go with ""MIGHT"".

After more thought: another common word with I in position 1 is impossible because of forbidden letters? But wait, ""ITCHY"" has C? Not allowed.

""IMPEL"": E forbidden? Yes.

""IMPED"" -> E? Not allowed.

""IMPLY"": M,P,L,Y -> L and Y? Yes, but we can try ""IMPLY"". But then I at position 1? That's a possibility.

""IMPLY"": I, M, P, L, Y. All available letters? Yes.

Then we have I in position 1.

But we know that the secret word has an I, but we don't know its position. In ""bovid"", I was in position 4 and incorrect? So it must be either at 1,2,3, or 5? Now with this guess, we put I at position 1? That's okay.

Moreover, ""IMPLY"" tests different letters: M,P,L,Y? But L hasn't been tested? Yes.

Alternatively, ""slyly"" has two L's and Y? But no I? We must include I.

So, between ""MIGHT"" and ""IMPLY"", which one?

""IMPLY"" introduces L? But we can also introduce H and T? Maybe both are fine.

I think ""IMPLY"" is a good choice: 
- I in the first position? We test if it's correct? 
- New letters: M, P, L, Y.

But we also want to cover common letters? S and T are common. In ""MIGHT"", we test T? Which might be good.

But S is also common. We haven't tested S.

Let me consider ""PITHY"": P,I,T,H,Y -> includes T, and I is in position 2? Then tests P, T, H, Y.

But we don't have T in forbidden. 

A better word: ""SHIFT"": S,H,I,F,T -> avoid F? Actually, F is available? Yes, we haven't tested F. But we can.

But ""SHIFT"" has I in position 3? That might be good.

And it tests S, H, F, T? All new.

This seems to cover more ground? Since ""SHIFT"" includes I in the middle position? And new common letters S, H, F, T.

We also note that the forbidden letters include vowels we've eliminated? But we have I. The vowels: A and E are gone, O gone? So we only have I, U, and Y? But U? We haven't tested U? But we can.

But ""SHIFT"" doesn't include U? That's okay.

We'll go with ""SHIFT"" because it tests common letters.

Guess: ""shift""

But let me confirm structure: ""shift"" as in the verb? Five letters.

We have:
Position 1: S
2: H
3: I
4: F
5: T

I is in position 3? So not 4? That's a possible correct position? We don't know.

But we know from feedback that I is in the word? And in ""bovid"" I was at 4 and wrong? So if I is in 3, it might be correct? Or if it's actually in another position.

So our guess: ""SHIFT""

We'll see.

But note: in ""bovid"", the I was at position 4? So the secret word has an I but not at 4.

Therefore, testing position 3 with I is okay? Yes.

Similarly, we test new letters: S, H, F, T? And I? But we already know I is present? Yes? But we test its position? And we also test S, H, F, T.

Therefore, we go with ""shift"".

But I just realized: ""SHIFT"" has no repeated letters? Good.

So final word: shift.After analyzing the feedback from the first two guesses:
- None of the letters in ""crane"" (C, R, A, N, E) are in the secret word.
- In ""bovid,"" only I (marked as '-') is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 4). Letters B, O, V, and D are absent. 
- The secret word must contain the letter I, but not in position 4. All other positions (1, 2, 3, or 5) are still possible.
- Avoid reusing forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, V, D.

For the third guess, I need a word that: 
- Includes 'I' in a new position (not position 4) to test its correct location.
- Uses only available letters from the remaining English alphabet.
- Introduces new common consonants/vowels to maximize information.

I chose **""shift""** as the next guess because:
- It places 'I' in position 3—a previously untested position, which could help identify if 'I' belongs there.
- It tests four new common letters ('S', 'H', 'F', 'T') that haven't been evaluated yet.
- All letters are distinct and not forbidden, ensuring we gather broad new information.

<guess>shift</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: bovid -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(x) V(x) I(-) D(x)
Guess 3: shift -> FEEDBACK: S(x) H(x) I(-) F(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are making the fourth guess. We have feedback from three previous guesses:

1. crane: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x) → None of these letters (C, R, A, N, E) are in the secret word.
2. bovid: B(x), O(x), V(x), I(-), D(x) → 
   - I is in the word but not in the correct position (specifically, not position 4 since it was guessed at 4).
   - The letters B, O, V, D are not in the word.
3. shift: S(x), H(x), I(-), F(x), T(x) →
   - I is again marked as wrong position (but since we guessed at position 3, we know that I is not at position 3 either? But note: '-' means it is in the word but in the wrong position — so from ""bovid"", I is not at 4, and from ""shift"", I is not at 3? Or could it be that the word has more than one I? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. However, both guesses had I only once.

Important: The feedback for 'I' in ""shift"" is '-' which confirms that I is in the word, but not at position 3. So now we know:
- The secret word contains the letter I, but not in position 3 or 4 (from guesses 3 and 2 respectively).
- Also, we have eliminated additional letters: S, H, F, T (all marked absent).

Therefore, the set of forbidden letters (absent) is expanded to: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, V, D, S, H, F, T.

Additionally, the only letter we know for sure that is present is I, and it must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (since position 3 and 4 are ruled out).

We need to choose a word that:
- Includes the letter I in one of positions 1, 2, or 5.
- Uses only letters that are not forbidden (so new letters: available letters include G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z, etc).
- Avoids using letters that we've already eliminated.

Moreover, we want to maximize information by testing common letters.

List of forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, V, D, S, H, F, T.

Available letters (consonants): G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z.
Available vowels: U (and we know I is present, so we can have other vowels? Note: we've used O and not used U? Also, A, E are out, so vowels: U and sometimes Y).

So, we need to form a word with I and 4 other letters from the available set.

Position for I: must be in 1,2,5 (not 3 or 4).

Let's try to form words:

Option: Put I in position 1: I _ _ _ _
Then, we need the remaining four letters from available: G,J,K,L,M,P,Q,W,X,Y,Z,U.

Words:
- ""IGLOO"" → forbidden because O is absent? And also we have duplicate O? Not allowed because O is forbidden -> discard.
- ""INKED"" → N, E forbidden -> discard.
- We need to avoid forbidden: So letters like N, R, etc are forbidden.

""I"" followed by: G, U, M, P? 
- ""IGLUS"" → not a common word? But ""iglus"" is igloos → but O forbidden? Actually, no O? I-G-L-U-S? But S is forbidden -> S absent -> discard.
- ""IMPEL"" → E forbidden -> discard.
- ""INPUT"" → N forbidden -> discard.
- ""IMMIX"" → M-I-M-I-X → double M and double I? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, it is a word? Meaning to mix? But let's avoid complex.
- ""IMPLY"" → we considered earlier? But now forbidden: S and T? Not used? In forbidden: our forbidden list doesn't have M,P,L,Y? So ""IMPLY"" is possible? But in the third guess, we already tried ""shift"" and not ""imply""? And ""IMPLY"" hasn't been tested? But: letters in ""IMPLY"": I, M, P, L, Y? All should be available? 

But wait: I is in position 1? That's acceptable? And we test M, P, L, Y.

But note: in ""shift"", we got S(x), H(x), I(-), F(x), T(x): so I is confirmed present? So we know we must include I? We are including I? Yes, in position 1? That is a new position? And we avoid forbidden letters? So ""IMPLY"" seems plausible? 

But we haven't tested M, P, L, Y? Correct.

Now, another position: Put I in position 2? _ I _ _ _
Words: ""GUILE"" → G,U,I,L,E? E forbidden -> discard.
""QUILL"" → Q,U,I,L,L → L repeated? But E isn't present? Forbidden not: Q,U,L? But we also have I? And double L? But ""QUILL"" has Q,U,I,L? Forbidden: Q,U,L? We haven't tested them? So yes? But the word? 

But also: ""JUMPS"" → J,U,M,P,S? S forbidden -> discard.
""GIVEN"" → G,I,V,E,N? V,E,N forbidden -> discard.

So position 2: word like ""GUILT"" → G,U,I,L,T? T forbidden (from ""shift"" feedback: T(x)) -> discard.

Position 5: _ _ _ _ I → we need words that end with I? In English, these are rare? Like ""TAXI"" → too short? ""ALIBI"" → A,L,I,B,I? But A forbidden? Also B forbidden -> discard.
""RAFFI"" → R,A forbidden -> discard.
""MANKI"" not common? Or ""QWERTI"" not a word? 

Therefore, it's easier to put I at position 1? 

So I choose position 1: ""IMPLY"" → I,M,P,L,Y? But we must avoid letters we've tested? And M,P,L,Y haven't been tested? So let's test them.

But note: we must check if the word exists: ""IMPLY"" is valid.

Alternatively, we can try ""INKED""? But N,K,E? Forbidden letters? E and N forbidden? Discard.

Another word: ""ICILY"" → I,C,Y,L? But C forbidden -> discard.

""IGLU"" → four letters? Not five.

""IMAM"" → four letters.

So ""IMPLY"" seems a good candidate.

However, let me think of other options? 

Word with I at position 2: ""GUPPY""? G,U,P,P,Y? U? And double P? No I? Then not? We must include I? So position must have I at 2.

""GUILE"" forbidden? Then ""QUIPH""? not a word. ""BUILT?"" B forbidden -> discard.

Therefore, ""IMPLY"" is a strong candidate.

But we also need to test if I is correctly placed? We don't know? But we try.

Another idea: include 'U'? Since we haven't tested vowels? Only I? We haven't tested U.

So word: ""QUICK"" → Q,U,I,C,K? C forbidden -> discard.
""JUICY"" → J,U,I,C,Y? C forbidden -> discard.
""GUISE"" → G,U,I,S,E? S and E forbidden -> discard.

So U may be hard? And we haven't tested? But no good word comes.

Perhaps ""PIOUS"" → P,I,O,U,S? O and S forbidden -> discard.

So back to ""IMPLY"".

But we also have the issue of whether the word might have duplicate letters? We avoid for maximum information.

Therefore, we guess ""IMPLY"".

But note: in ""IMPLY"", I is at position 1? And we know the I is present? So we test: if the I is correct? Or wrong? And test M,P,L,Y.

So word: imply

Let's write it: I M P L Y

Now, feedback might tell us:

- If I is correct? Position 1? Then feedback for I: ✓
- Otherwise, if '-' (in word but not here) or 'x'? But wait, we know I is in the word? So it should not be 'x', but '-'? 

But if 'x' would be inconsistent? But actually, if we put I in position 1 and the secret word has only one I? Then if I at position 1 is wrong? Then it should be '-'? Unless there is a duplicate? But we don't know.

But anyway, we proceed.

So guess: imply

But let me verify: is there another word that might be better? For example, with U? 

Word: ""MUCID"" → M,U,C,I,D? C and D forbidden -> discard.
""USQUE"" → not common? 

I think ""IMPLY"" is the best option.

We'll guess ""IMPLY"".

But note: our goal is to find the secret word? We have 6 tries? So we are on try 4? So we have 4,5,6? Still three? So we can.

Thus, we return ""IMPLY"".For the fourth guess, we have:
- Confirmed letters: Only 'I' is known to be in the secret word (from Guess 2 and Guess 3), but it is not in position 3 or 4 (ruled out by feedback).
- Forbidden letters (absent): C, R, A, N, E, B, O, V, D, S, H, F, T (total 13 letters).
- Available letters: G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.
- Valid positions for 'I': 1, 2, or 5 (positions 3 and 4 are eliminated).

I chose **""IMPLY""** as the next guess because:
- It places 'I' in position 1 (a new position to test).
- It introduces four new, common letters (M, P, L, Y), maximizing potential information.
- It uses only untested letters from the available set, ensuring no reuse of forbidden letters.
- The word ""IMPLY"" is a valid English word and aligns with strategy to narrow down positional placements for 'I' and expand tested characters.

O forbidden? Yes, but here we have L,I,M,T. Only I and M? Actually, ""LIMIT"" has letters L, I, M, T. But we have two I\'s? Wait, the word ""limit"" is spelled L-I-M-I-T. We can use repeated letters? The rules didn\'t say distinct, so repeated letters might be in the word.\n\nBut in feedback, if there are two I\'s and the secret word has one I, then one I might be marked and the other not. But let\'s avoid complexity if we can.\n\nBut we must include at least one I since we know it\'s present.\n\nAnother word: ""QUICK"" -> Q,U,I,C,K -> C is forbidden -> discard.\n\n""JUMPS"" -> no I. \n\nWord with I in second position: e.g., ""SIXTH"" -> S,I,X,T,H -> available letters? S, X, T, H are allowed? Yes.\nBut ""SIXTH"" is a word? Yes. But let\'s check if it\'s common enough.\n\nAnother: ""WIMPY"" -> W,I,M,P,Y.\n\nOr ""LISPY""? Not a word. ""FISHY"": F,I,S,H,Y -> F is allowed? Yes.\n\nBut ""FISHY"" has F,I,S,H,Y. All letters are allowed? We have F,S,H,Y available? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""TIPSY"": T,I,P,S,Y.\n\nBut we want to test more new letters.\n\nWe also have position 3: _ _ I _ _\n\nWord: ""FLING"" -> L forbidden? Wait, L is not forbidden? Forbidden are: C,R,A,N,E,B,O,V,D. So L is okay? But N is forbidden -> discard. ""FLICK"" -> C forbidden. ""BLIMP"" -> B forbidden. ""SLING"" -> S,L,I,N,G -> N forbidden -> discard. ""THING"" -> H,I,N,G -> N forbidden -> discard.\n\nPosition 3: ""AXING"" -> X,I,N,G -> N forbidden. No.\n\nPosition 5: _ _ _ _ I\n\nWord: ""TACIT"" -> T,A,C,I,T -> A,C forbidden -> discard. ""JUMPS"" no I. ""ZAPPY"" no I. ""HAPPY"" no I. ""PENWI"" not a word.\n\nCommon word ending with I: ""TAXI"" -> too short. ""ALIBI"" -> A and I, but A forbidden? Yes. ""TODDI"" not word. ""BASIJ"" not English.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word with I not at position 4? We know it\'s not at position 4.\n\nAfter scanning, let\'s try a word with I at position 2: ""PILOT"" is forbidden because of O. ""MIGHT"": M,I,G,H,T -> has M,I,G,H,T. All available? M is available? M is not forbidden. Letters forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,B,O,V,D. So M is allowed. G is allowed? Yes. H, T allowed.\n\nSo ""MIGHT"": M, I, G, H, T.\n\nPositions: \n1: M\n2: I\n3: G\n4: H\n5: T\n\nWe know I should not be at position 4? But in this word, I is at position 2, so that\'s okay.\n\nSimilarly, we could try ""FIGHT"", but F is also available? And we haven\'t tested F.\n\nBut ""FIGHT"" has F,I,G,H,T -> F is available.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word with I at position 3? Like ""DIGIT"" -> D is forbidden -> discard. ""LIGHT"": L,I,G,H,T -> L available -> yes.\n\nBut we want to include more new letters.\n\nWhat about ""SIGHT"": S,I,G,H,T -> S available? Yes.\n\nBut we also have position 1: if we try, but we had difficulty.\n\nLet me pick ""GIPSY"": G,I,P,S,Y -> available letters? G,P,S,Y are available? Yes.\n\n""GIPSY"" is a word? Yes, meaning a Gypsy.\n\nLetters: G, I, P, S, Y.\n\nWe know I is present, so we put it in the word. We can also try to cover multiple positions.\n\nBut note, we don\'t know if G, P, S, Y are present? We test them.\n\nAlternatively, ""PITHY"": P,I,T,H,Y -> available.\n\nBut let us decide: We must avoid forbidden letters and include I.\n\nConsidered:\n- ""FISHY"": F,I,S,H,Y -> positions: I at position 2? Yes.\n- ""MIGHT"": M,I,G,H,T -> I at 2.\n- ""SIGHT"": S,I,G,H,T -> similar.\n\nBut we also have the option to put I at position 5? Hard.\n\nI\'ll go with ""MIGHT"". It introduces M,I,G,H,T. All new letters? Yes.\n\nWe get to test M, G, H, T as well.\n\nSo guess: might\n\nBut let me make sure: ""might"" is a 5-letter English word? Yes.\n\nWe note: In ""bovid"", I was in position 4 and was misplaced. Now we put I in position 2? That\'s fine because we don\'t know the correct position.\n\nSo our next guess: ""MIGHT"".\n\nHowever, we might consider a word that puts I in multiple positions? But unnecessary? And we don\'t require it.\n\nWe also have the word ""STILL"" -> S,T,I,L,L? But we are not forbidden L? But ""STILL"" has two L\'s. And I is at position 3? We know I must be in some other than 4? But in this case, positions differ.\n\nBut if the word has double letters, feedback might be tricky? But it\'s acceptable.\n\nTo avoid complication, let\'s go with ""MIGHT"".\n\nAfter more thought: another common word with I in position 1 is impossible because of forbidden letters? But wait, ""ITCHY"" has C? Not allowed.\n\n""IMPEL"": E forbidden? Yes.\n\n""IMPED"" -> E? Not allowed.\n\n""IMPLY"": M,P,L,Y -> L and Y? Yes, but we can try ""IMPLY"". But then I at position 1? That\'s a possibility.\n\n""IMPLY"": I, M, P, L, Y. All available letters? Yes.\n\nThen we have I in position 1.\n\nBut we know that the secret word has an I, but we don\'t know its position. In ""bovid"", I was in position 4 and incorrect? So it must be either at 1,2,3, or 5? Now with this guess, we put I at position 1? That\'s okay.\n\nMoreover, ""IMPLY"" tests different letters: M,P,L,Y? But L hasn\'t been tested? Yes.\n\nAlternatively, ""slyly"" has two L\'s and Y? But no I? We must include I.\n\nSo, between ""MIGHT"" and ""IMPLY"", which one?\n\n""IMPLY"" introduces L? But we can also introduce H and T? Maybe both are fine.\n\nI think ""IMPLY"" is a good choice: \n- I in the first position? We test if it\'s correct? \n- New letters: M, P, L, Y.\n\nBut we also want to cover common letters? S and T are common. In ""MIGHT"", we test T? Which might be good.\n\nBut S is also common. We haven\'t tested S.\n\nLet me consider ""PITHY"": P,I,T,H,Y -> includes T, and I is in position 2? Then tests P, T, H, Y.\n\nBut we don\'t have T in forbidden. \n\nA better word: ""SHIFT"": S,H,I,F,T -> avoid F? Actually, F is available? Yes, we haven\'t tested F. But we can.\n\nBut ""SHIFT"" has I in position 3? That might be good.\n\nAnd it tests S, H, F, T? All new.\n\nThis seems to cover more ground? Since ""SHIFT"" includes I in the middle position? And new common letters S, H, F, T.\n\nWe also note that the forbidden letters include vowels we\'ve eliminated? But we have I. The vowels: A and E are gone, O gone? So we only have I, U, and Y? But U? We haven\'t tested U? But we can.\n\nBut ""SHIFT"" doesn\'t include U? That\'s okay.\n\nWe\'ll go with ""SHIFT"" because it tests common letters.\n\nGuess: ""shift""\n\nBut let me confirm structure: ""shift"" as in the verb? Five letters.\n\nWe have:\nPosition 1: S\n2: H\n3: I\n4: F\n5: T\n\nI is in position 3? So not 4? That\'s a possible correct position? We don\'t know.\n\nBut we know from feedback that I is in the word? And in ""bovid"" I was at 4 and wrong? So if I is in 3, it might be correct? Or if it\'s actually in another position.\n\nSo our guess: ""SHIFT""\n\nWe\'ll see.\n\nBut note: in ""bovid"", the I was at position 4? So the secret word has an I but not at 4.\n\nTherefore, testing position 3 with I is okay? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, we test new letters: S, H, F, T? And I? But we already know I is present? Yes? But we test its position? And we also test S, H, F, T.\n\nTherefore, we go with ""shift"".\n\nBut I just realized: ""SHIFT"" has no repeated letters? Good.\n\nSo final word: shift.After analyzing the feedback from the first two guesses:\n- None of the letters in ""crane"" (C, R, A, N, E) are in the secret word.\n- In ""bovid,"" only I (marked as \'-\') is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 4). Letters B, O, V, and D are absent. \n- The secret word must contain the letter I, but not in position 4. All other positions (1, 2, 3, or 5) are still possible.\n- Avoid reusing forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, V, D.\n\nFor the third guess, I need a word that: \n- Includes \'I\' in a new position (not position 4) to test its correct location.\n- Uses only available letters from the remaining English alphabet.\n- Introduces new common consonants/vowels to maximize information.\n\nI chose **""shift""** as the next guess because:\n- It places \'I\' in position 3—a previously untested position, which could help identify if \'I\' belongs there.\n- It tests four new common letters (\'S\', \'H\', \'F\', \'T\') that haven\'t been evaluated yet.\n- All letters are distinct and not forbidden, ensuring we gather broad new information.\n\n<guess>shift</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: bovid -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(x) V(x) I(-) D(x)\nGuess 3: shift -> FEEDBACK: S(x) H(x) I(-) F(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are making the fourth guess. We have feedback from three previous guesses:\n\n1. crane: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x) → None of these letters (C, R, A, N, E) are in the secret word.\n2. bovid: B(x), O(x), V(x), I(-), D(x) → \n   - I is in the word but not in the correct position (specifically, not position 4 since it was guessed at 4).\n   - The letters B, O, V, D are not in the word.\n3. shift: S(x), H(x), I(-), F(x), T(x) →\n   - I is again marked as wrong position (but since we guessed at position 3, we know that I is not at position 3 either? But note: \'-\' means it is in the word but in the wrong position — so from ""bovid"", I is not at 4, and from ""shift"", I is not at 3? Or could it be that the word has more than one I? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. However, both guesses had I only once.\n\nImportant: The feedback for \'I\' in ""shift"" is \'-\' which confirms that I is in the word, but not at position 3. So now we know:\n- The secret word contains the letter I, but not in position 3 or 4 (from guesses 3 and 2 respectively).\n- Also, we have eliminated additional letters: S, H, F, T (all marked absent).\n\nTherefore, the set of forbidden letters (absent) is expanded to: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, V, D, S, H, F, T.\n\nAdditionally, the only letter we know for sure that is present is I, and it must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (since position 3 and 4 are ruled out).\n\nWe need to choose a word that:\n- Includes the letter I in one of positions 1, 2, or 5.\n- Uses only letters that are not forbidden (so new letters: available letters include G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z, etc).\n- Avoids using letters that we\'ve already eliminated.\n\nMoreover, we want to maximize information by testing common letters.\n\nList of forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, V, D, S, H, F, T.\n\nAvailable letters (consonants): G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z.\nAvailable vowels: U (and we know I is present, so we can have other vowels? Note: we\'ve used O and not used U? Also, A, E are out, so vowels: U and sometimes Y).\n\nSo, we need to form a word with I and 4 other letters from the available set.\n\nPosition for I: must be in 1,2,5 (not 3 or 4).\n\nLet\'s try to form words:\n\nOption: Put I in position 1: I _ _ _ _\nThen, we need the remaining four letters from available: G,J,K,L,M,P,Q,W,X,Y,Z,U.\n\nWords:\n- ""IGLOO"" → forbidden because O is absent? And also we have duplicate O? Not allowed because O is forbidden -> discard.\n- ""INKED"" → N, E forbidden -> discard.\n- We need to avoid forbidden: So letters like N, R, etc are forbidden.\n\n""I"" followed by: G, U, M, P? \n- ""IGLUS"" → not a common word? But ""iglus"" is igloos → but O forbidden? Actually, no O? I-G-L-U-S? But S is forbidden -> S absent -> discard.\n- ""IMPEL"" → E forbidden -> discard.\n- ""INPUT"" → N forbidden -> discard.\n- ""IMMIX"" → M-I-M-I-X → double M and double I? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, it is a word? Meaning to mix? But let\'s avoid complex.\n- ""IMPLY"" → we considered earlier? But now forbidden: S and T? Not used? In forbidden: our forbidden list doesn\'t have M,P,L,Y? So ""IMPLY"" is possible? But in the third guess, we already tried ""shift"" and not ""imply""? And ""IMPLY"" hasn\'t been tested? But: letters in ""IMPLY"": I, M, P, L, Y? All should be available? \n\nBut wait: I is in position 1? That\'s acceptable? And we test M, P, L, Y.\n\nBut note: in ""shift"", we got S(x), H(x), I(-), F(x), T(x): so I is confirmed present? So we know we must include I? We are including I? Yes, in position 1? That is a new position? And we avoid forbidden letters? So ""IMPLY"" seems plausible? \n\nBut we haven\'t tested M, P, L, Y? Correct.\n\nNow, another position: Put I in position 2? _ I _ _ _\nWords: ""GUILE"" → G,U,I,L,E? E forbidden -> discard.\n""QUILL"" → Q,U,I,L,L → L repeated? But E isn\'t present? Forbidden not: Q,U,L? But we also have I? And double L? But ""QUILL"" has Q,U,I,L? Forbidden: Q,U,L? We haven\'t tested them? So yes? But the word? \n\nBut also: ""JUMPS"" → J,U,M,P,S? S forbidden -> discard.\n""GIVEN"" → G,I,V,E,N? V,E,N forbidden -> discard.\n\nSo position 2: word like ""GUILT"" → G,U,I,L,T? T forbidden (from ""shift"" feedback: T(x)) -> discard.\n\nPosition 5: _ _ _ _ I → we need words that end with I? In English, these are rare? Like ""TAXI"" → too short? ""ALIBI"" → A,L,I,B,I? But A forbidden? Also B forbidden -> discard.\n""RAFFI"" → R,A forbidden -> discard.\n""MANKI"" not common? Or ""QWERTI"" not a word? \n\nTherefore, it\'s easier to put I at position 1? \n\nSo I choose position 1: ""IMPLY"" → I,M,P,L,Y? But we must avoid letters we\'ve tested? And M,P,L,Y haven\'t been tested? So let\'s test them.\n\nBut note: we must check if the word exists: ""IMPLY"" is valid.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""INKED""? But N,K,E? Forbidden letters? E and N forbidden? Discard.\n\nAnother word: ""ICILY"" → I,C,Y,L? But C forbidden -> discard.\n\n""IGLU"" → four letters? Not five.\n\n""IMAM"" → four letters.\n\nSo ""IMPLY"" seems a good candidate.\n\nHowever, let me think of other options? \n\nWord with I at position 2: ""GUPPY""? G,U,P,P,Y? U? And double P? No I? Then not? We must include I? So position must have I at 2.\n\n""GUILE"" forbidden? Then ""QUIPH""? not a word. ""BUILT?"" B forbidden -> discard.\n\nTherefore, ""IMPLY"" is a strong candidate.\n\nBut we also need to test if I is correctly placed? We don\'t know? But we try.\n\nAnother idea: include \'U\'? Since we haven\'t tested vowels? Only I? We haven\'t tested U.\n\nSo word: ""QUICK"" → Q,U,I,C,K? C forbidden -> discard.\n""JUICY"" → J,U,I,C,Y? C forbidden -> discard.\n""GUISE"" → G,U,I,S,E? S and E forbidden -> discard.\n\nSo U may be hard? And we haven\'t tested? But no good word comes.\n\nPerhaps ""PIOUS"" → P,I,O,U,S? O and S forbidden -> discard.\n\nSo back to ""IMPLY"".\n\nBut we also have the issue of whether the word might have duplicate letters? We avoid for maximum information.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""IMPLY"".\n\nBut note: in ""IMPLY"", I is at position 1? And we know the I is present? So we test: if the I is correct? Or wrong? And test M,P,L,Y.\n\nSo word: imply\n\nLet\'s write it: I M P L Y\n\nNow, feedback might tell us:\n\n- If I is correct? Position 1? Then feedback for I: ✓\n- Otherwise, if \'-\' (in word but not here) or \'x\'? But wait, we know I is in the word? So it should not be \'x\', but \'-\'? \n\nBut if \'x\' would be inconsistent? But actually, if we put I in position 1 and the secret word has only one I? Then if I at position 1 is wrong? Then it should be \'-\'? Unless there is a duplicate? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut anyway, we proceed.\n\nSo guess: imply\n\nBut let me verify: is there another word that might be better? For example, with U? \n\nWord: ""MUCID"" → M,U,C,I,D? C and D forbidden -> discard.\n""USQUE"" → not common? \n\nI think ""IMPLY"" is the best option.\n\nWe\'ll guess ""IMPLY"".\n\nBut note: our goal is to find the secret word? We have 6 tries? So we are on try 4? So we have 4,5,6? Still three? So we can.\n\nThus, we return ""IMPLY"".For the fourth guess, we have:\n- Confirmed letters: Only \'I\' is known to be in the secret word (from Guess 2 and Guess 3), but it is not in position 3 or 4 (ruled out by feedback).\n- Forbidden letters (absent): C, R, A, N, E, B, O, V, D, S, H, F, T (total 13 letters).\n- Available letters: G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.\n- Valid positions for \'I\': 1, 2, or 5 (positions 3 and 4 are eliminated).\n\nI chose **""IMPLY""** as the next guess because:\n- It places \'I\' in position 1 (a new position to test).\n- It introduces four new, common letters (M, P, L, Y), maximizing potential information.\n- It uses only untested letters from the available set, ensuring no reuse of forbidden letters.\n- The word ""IMPLY"" is a valid English word and aligns with strategy to narrow down positional placements for \'I\' and expand tested characters.\n\n<guess>imply</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: bovid -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(x) V(x) I(-) D(x)\nGuess 3: shift -> FEEDBACK: S(x) H(x) I(-) F(x) T(x)\nGuess 4: imply -> FEEDBACK: I(-) M(x) P(x) L(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are making the fifth guess. We have feedback from four previous guesses:

1. crane: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x) → Absent: C, R, A, N, E
2. bovid: B(x), O(x), V(x), I(-), D(x) → Absent: B, O, V, D; Present (wrong position): I
3. shift: S(x), H(x), I(-), F(x), T(x) → Absent: S, H, F, T; Present (wrong position): I (again, so I is in the word but not at position 3 or 4)
4. imply: I(-), M(x), P(x), L(✓), Y(✓) → 
   - I: present but not at position 1 (since we guessed I at position 1 and got '-')
   - M: absent
   - P: absent
   - L: correct at position 4 (so the secret word has L in the 4th position)
   - Y: correct at position 5 (so the secret word has Y in the 5th position)

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has L in the 4th position and Y in the 5th position. So the word ends with ""LY"".
- The letter I is in the word, but not in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from guesses 4, 3, and 2 respectively). Therefore, I must be in position 2 (since position 5 is taken by Y, so I cannot be there). 
  - Positions: 
    - Position 1: I was tried and wrong (from imply)
    - Position 2: not tried yet? Actually, in bovid I was at 4, shift at 3, imply at 1. So position 2 is the only one left? 
    - But note: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. 
    - We know: 
        - Position 4: L (correct)
        - Position 5: Y (correct)
        - I cannot be at 1 (tried in imply), 3 (tried in shift), or 4 (tried in bovid, and now 4 is L). 
        - Therefore, I must be at position 2? Because position 5 is taken by Y? So the only position left for I is 2.

So the secret word has the form: _ I _ L Y

But we also know that the word has exactly these: 
- Position 2: I (we are now deducing it must be there because it has to be somewhere and only position 2 is left? But we haven't tested position 2? However, we know I is in the word and the only position not tried and available is 2? Because 1,3,4,5 are either tried or occupied by known letters? 
  - Position 1: we tried I and it was wrong? So I is not at 1? 
  - Position 3: we tried I and it was wrong? 
  - Position 4: we know it's L? So I cannot be there? 
  - Position 5: we know it's Y? So I cannot be there? 
  - Therefore, I must be at position 2? 

But we haven't tested position 2? So we are deducing? Yes, because the feedback tells us I is in the word? So it must be in one of the positions? And we've eliminated 1,3,4,5? So 2 is the only possibility? 

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ I _ L Y

Now, we need to find the first and third letters? 

We also have a list of absent letters: 
From all guesses: 
- crane: C, R, A, N, E
- bovid: B, O, V, D
- shift: S, H, F, T
- imply: M, P

So absent: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, V, D, S, H, F, T, M, P

That leaves available letters: G, J, K, Q, U, W, X, Z

We need to form a word: _ I _ L Y

The first and third positions must be filled with two letters from the available set? 

But note: the third position is the only one we don't know? And the first? 

We need to find a 5-letter word that matches: [letter1] I [letter3] L Y

And the two letters must be from: G, J, K, Q, U, W, X, Z

Now, we can list possible words? 

Common words ending with ""ILY"": 
- WILY: W I L Y? But that's 4 letters? We need 5? So not? 
- But we have 5 letters: the pattern is _ I _ L Y? So the third letter is between I and L? 

So the word is: [1] I [3] L Y

We need to find words that fit: ?I?LY

Possible words: 
- ""WILLY"": W I L L Y? But that has two L's? And the third letter would be L? But then the pattern: 
  Position 1: W
  Position 2: I
  Position 3: L? But then position 4 is L? But we know position 4 is L? So if position 3 is L? Then it would be ""W I L L Y""? 
  But we have feedback that L is only at position 4? Or could there be two L's? 
  The feedback for ""imply"" had L at position 4 as correct? But if the word has two L's? Then in ""imply"", we only had one L? So we don't know? 

But let's check: in ""imply"", we had L at position 4? And it was marked correct? That doesn't tell us about other L's? 

Similarly, in other guesses? We haven't tested L elsewhere? 

But in the pattern, we have position 3: we don't know? 

So ""WILLY"" is a word? Meaning? But it has two L's? 

But we have to consider: the available letters? W is available? 

But also, ""GILLY"": G I L L Y? Again, two L's? 

But we don't know if the word has two L's? 

Alternatively, words without double L? 

For example: ""JILKY""? Not a common word? 
""KILLY"": K I L L Y? Double L? 
""QUILLY"": Q U I L L Y? Double L? 

But what about without double L? 

""BILLY"": B is forbidden? 
""FILLY"": F is forbidden? 
""VILLY"": V forbidden? 
""TILLY"": T forbidden? 

So all these have double L? 

But we have available letters: G, J, K, Q, U, W, X, Z

So possible words: 
- ""WILLY"": W I L L Y? But then the third letter is L? And we have L at position 3? But we know position 4 is L? So if the word has two L's? Then it's possible? 
  But in the feedback for ""imply"", we had L at position 4? And it was correct? But we didn't test L at other positions? So it could be that L is also at position 3? 

But note: in ""imply"", we had L at position 4? And we got it correct? But if the secret word has L at position 3? Then in ""imply"", we didn't have L at position 3? So we wouldn't know? 

But the feedback for ""imply"" only tells us that the L at position 4 is correct? It doesn't say anything about other L's? 

Similarly, we haven't tested L at position 3? 

So ""WILLY"" is a candidate? 

But let's see the pattern: 
- Position 1: W
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: L
- Position 4: L? But that would be two L's? And we know position 4 is L? So if position 3 is L? Then the word is ""WILLY""? 

But ""WILLY"" is spelled W-I-L-L-Y? So positions: 
1: W
2: I
3: L
4: L
5: Y

But we have position 4 as L? And position 5 as Y? So that matches? But then position 3 is also L? 

But we don't have any feedback that says L cannot be at position 3? 

Similarly, we have available letters? W is available? 

But we also have other words: ""JILLY"" (not common? But J is available) or ""KILLY"" (K available) or ""GILLY"" (G available)? 

But note: we have to avoid forbidden letters? 

But ""WILLY"" uses W, I, L, L, Y? But L is already known? And I is known? So we are testing W? 

But we have to check if W is available? Yes, not forbidden? 

But we also have the letter U? 

Another word: ""QUILLY""? Q-U-I-L-L-Y? That's 6 letters? Not 5? 

""QUILL"" is 5? But then Q-U-I-L-L? But that ends with L? But we need to end with LY? So not? 

""JUMBO"" no? 

What about without double L? 

Is there a word like ""JIVED""? But D forbidden? 

""KITED""? T forbidden? 

""WIPED""? P forbidden? 

""GIMPY""? G,I,M,P,Y? But M and P are forbidden? 

So it seems the only possibilities are words with double L? Like ""WILLY"", ""GILLY"", ""JILLY"", ""KILLY"", etc? 

But we also have ""X"" and ""Z""? 

""ZILLY""? Z-I-L-L-Y? That's a word? Meaning silly? 

Similarly, ""WILLY"" is a word? 

But we have to choose one? 

We also have the first letter? 

But note: we have only one guess? We are on guess 5? And we have 6 tries? So we can try one? 

But we can also try to test multiple? 

But we know the pattern: ? I ? L Y

And the third letter must be one that can form a word? 

But if we assume the third letter is L? Then we have words like WILLY, GILLY, etc? 

But what if the third letter is not L? 

For example, is there a word like ""WIFLY""? Not a word? 
""WIDLY""? W I D L Y? But D is forbidden? 
""WIGLY""? Not a word? 
""WIKLY""? Not? 

""JILKY""? Not common? 

""KINLY""? K I N L Y? But N forbidden? 

So it seems that the only common words are those with double L? 

Therefore, we can guess one of them? 

But we have to choose? 

We also have U? 

""BUILT""? But B forbidden? 

""GUILD""? G U I L D? But D forbidden? 

So no? 

Therefore, we must choose a word with double L? 

Now, which one? 

We have available: G, J, K, Q, U, W, X, Z

So possible words: 
- GILLY: G I L L Y
- JILLY: J I L L Y (less common? But acceptable? Jilly is a name? But in word games, it might be accepted? But let's see)
- KILLY: K I L L Y (meaning? Killing? Or a kiln? Not common? But killy is a word? Meaning having kilns? Or a fish? But we can use)
- WILLY: W I L L Y (common? Meaning cunning? Or a name? But valid)
- ZILLY: Z I L L Y (silly? Informal? But valid)

But we also have Q? But ""QUILLY"" is 6 letters? 

Or ""QILLY""? Not a word? 

U: ""UILLY""? Not a word? 

X: ""XILLY""? Not a word? 

So only G, J, K, W, Z? 

Now, to maximize information? But we are trying to solve? 

We know the pattern: ? I L L Y? But the third letter is L? So the word is [1] I L L Y? 

But we don't know the first letter? 

We need to test the first letter? 

But we have to choose one? 

We can choose the most common? ""WILLY"" is common? 

But we have to avoid? 

Alternatively, we can think: we haven't tested G, J, K, W, Z? 

But we are forced to use one? 

So let's pick ""WILLY""? 

But note: if we guess ""WILLY"", and if the first letter is not W? Then we get feedback? 

But we are on guess 5? We have one more guess? 

But if we are wrong? Then we can use the next? 

But we can also try to cover? 

But we don't have a way to test multiple? 

So we guess one? 

I think ""WILLY"" is a good candidate? 

But let me check: the secret word must have I at position 2? And L at 4? Y at 5? And the third letter must be L? 

So the word is of the form: ? I L L Y

Therefore, we can list the possibilities: 
- GILLY
- JILLY
- KILLY
- WILLY
- ZILLY

We have to choose one? 

We can choose the most common? ""WILLY"" is the most common? 

But we also have ""SILLY""? But S is forbidden? 

""BILLY"": B forbidden? 

""FILLY"": F forbidden? 

So only the ones above? 

I'll go with ""WILLY"". 

But note: in ""WILLY"", we have:
- Position 1: W
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: L
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: Y

We know position 4 is L? So if we guess, we might get:
- W: if correct? Then ✓, else if absent? Then x? Or if present but wrong position? 
- I: should be correct? Because we deduced it must be at position 2? 
- L at position 3: if the word has two L's? Then it might be correct? Or if not? But we think it must be L? 
- L at position 4: we know it's correct? 
- Y: we know it's correct? 

But if the word is ""GILLY"", then W would be absent? 

So we guess ""WILLY"" to test? 

But we are on guess 5? We can do? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests the first letter without assuming the third is L? 

But we don't have many options? 

For example, is there a word that has the pattern: [letter1] I [letter3] L Y? And letter3 is not L? 

But we couldn't find? 

So we must assume letter3 is L? 

Therefore, we guess ""WILLY"". 

But let me confirm: the feedback from ""imply"" had L at position 4 correct? And we didn't test L at other positions? So it could be that the word has only one L? 

But if the word has only one L? Then the third letter cannot be L? 

But then what word could it be? 

For example, ""WIVED""? But V and D forbidden? 
""WIPED""? P forbidden? 
""WIDED""? D forbidden? 
""WIFED""? Not a word? 
""WIKED""? Not? 

""JIVED"": J I V E D? V, E, D forbidden? 

""KITED"": K I T E D? T, E, D forbidden? 

""GIMPY"": G I M P Y? M and P forbidden? 

So no? 

Therefore, the only possibility is that the third letter is L? 

So we must have a word with double L? 

Thus, we guess ""WILLY"". 

But to be safe, we can choose a word that uses a letter we haven't tested? But we have to use one of G, J, K, W, Z? 

We'll go with ""WILLY"". 

So guess: willy

But note: ""willy"" is a valid word? Yes.

Therefore, we output ""willy"". 

But let me write it in the required format.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x).  
- **Guess 2: bovid** → B, O, V, D are absent (x); I is present but in the wrong position (-).  
- **Guess 3: shift** → S, H, F, T are absent (x); I is present but in the wrong position (-).  
- **Guess 4: imply** → I is present but in the wrong position (-); M and P are absent (x); L is correct (✓) at position 4; Y is correct (✓) at position 5.  

### Key Deductions
1. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:  
   - Position 4 is **L** (from `imply` feedback).  
   - Position 5 is **Y** (from `imply` feedback).  
   - The word ends with **LY**.  

2. **Confirmed Present Letter (Wrong Position)**:  
   - **I** is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, or 4 (tested in `imply`, `shift`, and `bovid`).  
   - Since position 5 is Y, **I must be in position 2** (the only remaining position).  

3. **Absent Letters**:  
   - All letters from previous guesses are absent: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, V, D, S, H, F, T, M, P.  
   - **Available letters**: G, J, K, Q, U, W, X, Z.  

4. **Word Structure**:  
   - The secret word must be of the form: **? I ? L Y** (with position 2 = I, position 4 = L, position 5 = Y).  
   - The unknown positions are 1 and 3.  

5. **Position 3 Requirement**:  
   - Given the constraints, the only feasible words have **L in position 3** (double-L pattern) because:  
     - No valid English words fit `? I ? L Y` without double-L (e.g., `GILLY`, `WILLY`).  
     - Alternatives (e.g., `JILKY`, `WIFLY`) are invalid or use forbidden letters.  
   - Thus, the word is **? I L L Y**, leaving only position 1 unknown.  

6. **Possible Words**:  
   - Position 1 must be one of the available letters: G, J, K, W, Z (Q, U, X are impractical here).  
   - Valid options: `GILLY`, `JILLY`, `KILLY`, `WILLY`, `ZILLY`.  

### Strategy for Guess 5
- **Goal**: Test the most common word to solve or narrow down position 1.  
- **Choice**: `WILLY` is selected because:  
  - It is a common English word (meaning cunning or a name).  
  - It tests `W` in position 1 (untested letter).  
  - If correct, we solve the puzzle; if not, feedback on `W` (absent/present) will reveal the solution in Guess 6.  

<guess>willy</guess>",willy,"We are making the fifth guess. We have feedback from four previous guesses:

1. crane: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x) → Absent: C, R, A, N, E
2. bovid: B(x), O(x), V(x), I(-), D(x) → Absent: B, O, V, D; Present (wrong position): I
3. shift: S(x), H(x), I(-), F(x), T(x) → Absent: S, H, F, T; Present (wrong position): I (again, so I is in the word but not at position 3 or 4)
4. imply: I(-), M(x), P(x), L(✓), Y(✓) → 
   - I: present but not at position 1 (since we guessed I at position 1 and got '-')
   - M: absent
   - P: absent
   - L: correct at position 4 (so the secret word has L in the 4th position)
   - Y: correct at position 5 (so the secret word has Y in the 5th position)

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has L in the 4th position and Y in the 5th position. So the word ends with ""LY"".
- The letter I is in the word, but not in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from guesses 4, 3, and 2 respectively). Therefore, I must be in position 2 (since position 5 is taken by Y, so I cannot be there). 
  - Positions: 
    - Position 1: I was tried and wrong (from imply)
    - Position 2: not tried yet? Actually, in bovid I was at 4, shift at 3, imply at 1. So position 2 is the only one left? 
    - But note: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. 
    - We know: 
        - Position 4: L (correct)
        - Position 5: Y (correct)
        - I cannot be at 1 (tried in imply), 3 (tried in shift), or 4 (tried in bovid, and now 4 is L). 
        - Therefore, I must be at position 2? Because position 5 is taken by Y? So the only position left for I is 2.

So the secret word has the form: _ I _ L Y

But we also know that the word has exactly these: 
- Position 2: I (we are now deducing it must be there because it has to be somewhere and only position 2 is left? But we haven't tested position 2? However, we know I is in the word and the only position not tried and available is 2? Because 1,3,4,5 are either tried or occupied by known letters? 
  - Position 1: we tried I and it was wrong? So I is not at 1? 
  - Position 3: we tried I and it was wrong? 
  - Position 4: we know it's L? So I cannot be there? 
  - Position 5: we know it's Y? So I cannot be there? 
  - Therefore, I must be at position 2? 

But we haven't tested position 2? So we are deducing? Yes, because the feedback tells us I is in the word? So it must be in one of the positions? And we've eliminated 1,3,4,5? So 2 is the only possibility? 

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ I _ L Y

Now, we need to find the first and third letters? 

We also have a list of absent letters: 
From all guesses: 
- crane: C, R, A, N, E
- bovid: B, O, V, D
- shift: S, H, F, T
- imply: M, P

So absent: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, V, D, S, H, F, T, M, P

That leaves available letters: G, J, K, Q, U, W, X, Z

We need to form a word: _ I _ L Y

The first and third positions must be filled with two letters from the available set? 

But note: the third position is the only one we don't know? And the first? 

We need to find a 5-letter word that matches: [letter1] I [letter3] L Y

And the two letters must be from: G, J, K, Q, U, W, X, Z

Now, we can list possible words? 

Common words ending with ""ILY"": 
- WILY: W I L Y? But that's 4 letters? We need 5? So not? 
- But we have 5 letters: the pattern is _ I _ L Y? So the third letter is between I and L? 

So the word is: [1] I [3] L Y

We need to find words that fit: ?I?LY

Possible words: 
- ""WILLY"": W I L L Y? But that has two L's? And the third letter would be L? But then the pattern: 
  Position 1: W
  Position 2: I
  Position 3: L? But then position 4 is L? But we know position 4 is L? So if position 3 is L? Then it would be ""W I L L Y""? 
  But we have feedback that L is only at position 4? Or could there be two L's? 
  The feedback for ""imply"" had L at position 4 as correct? But if the word has two L's? Then in ""imply"", we only had one L? So we don't know? 

But let's check: in ""imply"", we had L at position 4? And it was marked correct? That doesn't tell us about other L's? 

Similarly, in other guesses? We haven't tested L elsewhere? 

But in the pattern, we have position 3: we don't know? 

So ""WILLY"" is a word? Meaning? But it has two L's? 

But we have to consider: the available letters? W is available? 

But also, ""GILLY"": G I L L Y? Again, two L's? 

But we don't know if the word has two L's? 

Alternatively, words without double L? 

For example: ""JILKY""? Not a common word? 
""KILLY"": K I L L Y? Double L? 
""QUILLY"": Q U I L L Y? Double L? 

But what about without double L? 

""BILLY"": B is forbidden? 
""FILLY"": F is forbidden? 
""VILLY"": V forbidden? 
""TILLY"": T forbidden? 

So all these have double L? 

But we have available letters: G, J, K, Q, U, W, X, Z

So possible words: 
- ""WILLY"": W I L L Y? But then the third letter is L? And we have L at position 3? But we know position 4 is L? So if the word has two L's? Then it's possible? 
  But in the feedback for ""imply"", we had L at position 4? And it was correct? But we didn't test L at other positions? So it could be that L is also at position 3? 

But note: in ""imply"", we had L at position 4? And we got it correct? But if the secret word has L at position 3? Then in ""imply"", we didn't have L at position 3? So we wouldn't know? 

But the feedback for ""imply"" only tells us that the L at position 4 is correct? It doesn't say anything about other L's? 

Similarly, we haven't tested L at position 3? 

So ""WILLY"" is a candidate? 

But let's see the pattern: 
- Position 1: W
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: L
- Position 4: L? But that would be two L's? And we know position 4 is L? So if position 3 is L? Then the word is ""WILLY""? 

But ""WILLY"" is spelled W-I-L-L-Y? So positions: 
1: W
2: I
3: L
4: L
5: Y

But we have position 4 as L? And position 5 as Y? So that matches? But then position 3 is also L? 

But we don't have any feedback that says L cannot be at position 3? 

Similarly, we have available letters? W is available? 

But we also have other words: ""JILLY"" (not common? But J is available) or ""KILLY"" (K available) or ""GILLY"" (G available)? 

But note: we have to avoid forbidden letters? 

But ""WILLY"" uses W, I, L, L, Y? But L is already known? And I is known? So we are testing W? 

But we have to check if W is available? Yes, not forbidden? 

But we also have the letter U? 

Another word: ""QUILLY""? Q-U-I-L-L-Y? That's 6 letters? Not 5? 

""QUILL"" is 5? But then Q-U-I-L-L? But that ends with L? But we need to end with LY? So not? 

""JUMBO"" no? 

What about without double L? 

Is there a word like ""JIVED""? But D forbidden? 

""KITED""? T forbidden? 

""WIPED""? P forbidden? 

""GIMPY""? G,I,M,P,Y? But M and P are forbidden? 

So it seems the only possibilities are words with double L? Like ""WILLY"", ""GILLY"", ""JILLY"", ""KILLY"", etc? 

But we also have ""X"" and ""Z""? 

""ZILLY""? Z-I-L-L-Y? That's a word? Meaning silly? 

Similarly, ""WILLY"" is a word? 

But we have to choose one? 

We also have the first letter? 

But note: we have only one guess? We are on guess 5? And we have 6 tries? So we can try one? 

But we can also try to test multiple? 

But we know the pattern: ? I ? L Y

And the third letter must be one that can form a word? 

But if we assume the third letter is L? Then we have words like WILLY, GILLY, etc? 

But what if the third letter is not L? 

For example, is there a word like ""WIFLY""? Not a word? 
""WIDLY""? W I D L Y? But D is forbidden? 
""WIGLY""? Not a word? 
""WIKLY""? Not? 

""JILKY""? Not common? 

""KINLY""? K I N L Y? But N forbidden? 

So it seems that the only common words are those with double L? 

Therefore, we can guess one of them? 

But we have to choose? 

We also have U? 

""BUILT""? But B forbidden? 

""GUILD""? G U I L D? But D forbidden? 

So no? 

Therefore, we must choose a word with double L? 

Now, which one? 

We have available: G, J, K, Q, U, W, X, Z

So possible words: 
- GILLY: G I L L Y
- JILLY: J I L L Y (less common? But acceptable? Jilly is a name? But in word games, it might be accepted? But let's see)
- KILLY: K I L L Y (meaning? Killing? Or a kiln? Not common? But killy is a word? Meaning having kilns? Or a fish? But we can use)
- WILLY: W I L L Y (common? Meaning cunning? Or a name? But valid)
- ZILLY: Z I L L Y (silly? Informal? But valid)

But we also have Q? But ""QUILLY"" is 6 letters? 

Or ""QILLY""? Not a word? 

U: ""UILLY""? Not a word? 

X: ""XILLY""? Not a word? 

So only G, J, K, W, Z? 

Now, to maximize information? But we are trying to solve? 

We know the pattern: ? I L L Y? But the third letter is L? So the word is [1] I L L Y? 

But we don't know the first letter? 

We need to test the first letter? 

But we have to choose one? 

We can choose the most common? ""WILLY"" is common? 

But we have to avoid? 

Alternatively, we can think: we haven't tested G, J, K, W, Z? 

But we are forced to use one? 

So let's pick ""WILLY""? 

But note: if we guess ""WILLY"", and if the first letter is not W? Then we get feedback? 

But we are on guess 5? We have one more guess? 

But if we are wrong? Then we can use the next? 

But we can also try to cover? 

But we don't have a way to test multiple? 

So we guess one? 

I think ""WILLY"" is a good candidate? 

But let me check: the secret word must have I at position 2? And L at 4? Y at 5? And the third letter must be L? 

So the word is of the form: ? I L L Y

Therefore, we can list the possibilities: 
- GILLY
- JILLY
- KILLY
- WILLY
- ZILLY

We have to choose one? 

We can choose the most common? ""WILLY"" is the most common? 

But we also have ""SILLY""? But S is forbidden? 

""BILLY"": B forbidden? 

""FILLY"": F forbidden? 

So only the ones above? 

I'll go with ""WILLY"". 

But note: in ""WILLY"", we have:
- Position 1: W
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: L
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: Y

We know position 4 is L? So if we guess, we might get:
- W: if correct? Then ✓, else if absent? Then x? Or if present but wrong position? 
- I: should be correct? Because we deduced it must be at position 2? 
- L at position 3: if the word has two L's? Then it might be correct? Or if not? But we think it must be L? 
- L at position 4: we know it's correct? 
- Y: we know it's correct? 

But if the word is ""GILLY"", then W would be absent? 

So we guess ""WILLY"" to test? 

But we are on guess 5? We can do? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests the first letter without assuming the third is L? 

But we don't have many options? 

For example, is there a word that has the pattern: [letter1] I [letter3] L Y? And letter3 is not L? 

But we couldn't find? 

So we must assume letter3 is L? 

Therefore, we guess ""WILLY"". 

But let me confirm: the feedback from ""imply"" had L at position 4 correct? And we didn't test L at other positions? So it could be that the word has only one L? 

But if the word has only one L? Then the third letter cannot be L? 

But then what word could it be? 

For example, ""WIVED""? But V and D forbidden? 
""WIPED""? P forbidden? 
""WIDED""? D forbidden? 
""WIFED""? Not a word? 
""WIKED""? Not? 

""JIVED"": J I V E D? V, E, D forbidden? 

""KITED"": K I T E D? T, E, D forbidden? 

""GIMPY"": G I M P Y? M and P forbidden? 

So no? 

Therefore, the only possibility is that the third letter is L? 

So we must have a word with double L? 

Thus, we guess ""WILLY"". 

But to be safe, we can choose a word that uses a letter we haven't tested? But we have to use one of G, J, K, W, Z? 

We'll go with ""WILLY"". 

So guess: willy

But note: ""willy"" is a valid word? Yes.

Therefore, we output ""willy"". 

But let me write it in the required format.### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x).  
- **Guess 2: bovid** → B, O, V, D are absent (x); I is present but in the wrong position (-).  
- **Guess 3: shift** → S, H, F, T are absent (x); I is present but in the wrong position (-).  
- **Guess 4: imply** → I is present but in the wrong position (-); M and P are absent (x); L is correct (✓) at position 4; Y is correct (✓) at position 5.  

### Key Deductions
1. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:  
   - Position 4 is **L** (from `imply` feedback).  
   - Position 5 is **Y** (from `imply` feedback).  
   - The word ends with **LY**.  

2. **Confirmed Present Letter (Wrong Position)**:  
   - **I** is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, or 4 (tested in `imply`, `shift`, and `bovid`).  
   - Since position 5 is Y, **I must be in position 2** (the only remaining position).  

3. **Absent Letters**:  
   - All letters from previous guesses are absent: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, V, D, S, H, F, T, M, P.  
   - **Available letters**: G, J, K, Q, U, W, X, Z.  

4. **Word Structure**:  
   - The secret word must be of the form: **? I ? L Y** (with position 2 = I, position 4 = L, position 5 = Y).

     - Alternatives (e.g., `JILKY`, `WIFLY`) are invalid or use forbidden letters.  
   - Thus, the word is **? I L L Y**, leaving only position 1 unknown.  

6. **Possible Words**:  
   - Position 1 must be one of the available letters: G, J, K, W, Z (Q, U, X are impractical here).
