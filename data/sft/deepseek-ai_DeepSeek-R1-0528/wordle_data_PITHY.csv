We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 Since none of the letters in ""crane"" are in the secret word, we need to choose a word that uses entirely different letters.

 We should pick a word that uses other common letters in the English language to maximize the chance of hitting some letters in the secret word.

 Common letters that we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, B, M, P, Y, W, etc.

 A good second guess might be ""SLIMY"" or ""POULT"", but let's think of a word that covers more common letters.

 Another popular starting word is ""PIOUS"", but note that we have already ruled out the letters in ""crane"" (C,R,A,N,E). So we can use P, I, O, U, S.

 Alternatively, we can use ""TOILS"" or ""POUND"". However, we want to maximize the number of new letters.

 Let's consider the word ""PIOUS"": it uses P, I, O, U, S. All these are new.

 But note: we have 6 tries and we want to get as much information as possible. Another option is ""SLIPT"" (if we allow less common words) but we should stick to common words.

 However, the problem says ""valid 5-letter English word"", so we must choose a valid word.

 Let me think of words without C,R,A,N,E.

 Some options: 
   ""sight"", ""pound"", ""moldy"", ""bulky"", ""jumpy"", ""waltz"", etc.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. But we have already ruled out E, A, R, N. So the next most common are T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.

 We can try to cover T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U in the next few guesses.

 For the second guess, let's choose a word that includes T, O, I, S, H? But we can only use 5 letters.

 A good candidate: ""TOILS"" -> T, O, I, L, S. But note that we have already ruled out the letter 'I'? Wait, no: we haven't used 'I' yet. We only ruled out C,R,A,N,E.

 However, we must be cautious: the feedback for ""crane"" was all x, so the secret word does not contain any of C,R,A,N,E.

 So ""TOILS"" is a valid word and uses T, O, I, L, S.

 Alternatively, we can use ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T. This gives us H and U as well.

 But note: we have 5 letters. Let's compare:

 Option 1: ""TOILS"" -> T, O, I, L, S
 Option 2: ""SHOUT"" -> S, H, O, U, T

 Both cover 5 new letters. However, ""SHOUT"" includes H and U which are also common, and we haven't tried them.

 Another option: ""PIOUS"" -> P, I, O, U, S. This includes P and U.

 Since we have no information, any of these would be fine. But let's choose one that has a good distribution.

 I recall that in Wordle, after eliminating one set of letters, it's common to try another set of common letters.

 I'll go with ""SHOUT"" because it includes S, H, O, U, T. These are all common and we haven't tried them.

 So the second guess is ""SHOUT"".

 But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""SHOUT"" is a valid 5-letter word.

 Therefore, we guess ""SHOUT"".

<guess>shout</guess>
</think>
After the first guess ""crane"" received all ""x"" feedback, we know the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. For the next guess, we need a word that uses entirely new letters to maximize information. 

We should prioritize common unused letters like S, T, L, O, I, H, U, D, M, P, Y, etc. The word ""SHOUT"" is ideal because:
- It uses 5 new letters: S, H, O, U, T
- These are high-frequency letters in English
- It avoids any overlap with the excluded letters from ""crane""
- ""SHOUT"" is a valid 5-letter word

This guess will efficiently test new letters and positions.

Letters that are in the word: H and T (and possibly others we haven't guessed).

Since H and T are misplaced, we need to include both in our next guess but in different positions.

Also, note that the secret word has 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but so far we don't have duplicates. Let's proceed.

We must avoid using the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, O, U.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that H and T must be in the word. So our next guess must include H and T, and three other new letters.

We want to maximize information by testing new letters.

Let's list more common letters: among the available ones, common ones are: L, I, D, G, M, P, B, F, Y, W.

We should try to cover as many as possible.

Possible words that contain H and T, and three other new letters from the available set.

But note: H and T cannot be in position 2 and 5 respectively? Actually, H was guessed in position 2 and was wrong, so in the secret word H is not at position 2. Similarly, T is not at position 5.

So in our next guess, we must put H in a position other than 2, and T in a position other than 5.

Moreover, we don't know where they might be.

We also need to pick a valid 5-letter word.

Let's brainstorm words that have H and T, and avoid C,R,A,N,E,S,O,U.

Possible words:

- LIGHT: L, I, G, H, T -> includes H and T, and L, I, G are new. But we have to check positions: H is at position 4, T at position 5. But note position 5 for T was wrong in ""shout"", so T can be in position 5? Actually, the previous feedback for T was at position 5 and it was '-' meaning it's in the word but not at that position? Or does it mean it's in the word but not necessarily that position?

Looking back at the rules: '-' means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. That includes that it might be present elsewhere, but definitely not in that specific position.

So for T in ""shout"" (position 5), it means T is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot place T at position 5 in the next guess? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not at position 5.

Similarly, H is not at position 2.

So for our next guess, we must choose positions for H and T that are not position 2 and not position 5 respectively? Actually, we can choose any positions except that we know H is not in position 2 and T is not in position 5.

But note: the word might have H elsewhere and T elsewhere.

So in ""LIGHT"": 
- H is at position 4, which is fine because we only know it's not at 2.
- T is at position 5, but we know T is not at position 5? Wait, the feedback from ""shout"": T was at position 5 and got '-', meaning T is not at position 5. So if we put T at position 5 again, it would be incorrect.

Therefore, we must avoid putting T at position 5. Similarly, avoid H at position 2.

In ""LIGHT"", T is at position 5, which we know is impossible. So this word is invalid for our purpose.

So we need a word that has:
- H: not in position 2
- T: not in position 5
- And uses three new letters from the available set.

Let's think of other words.

Consider ""THIGH"": but that has two H's and two G's? Actually, ""THIGH"": T, H, I, G, H -> repeated H? And it has two H's. But we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. However, we have only two known letters so far.

But to maximize information, avoid repeated letters if possible.

What about ""LITHG""? That's not a word.

Another idea: ""WHITE"": W, H, I, T, E -> but E is excluded because from ""crane"" we know E is not in the word. So no.

""PITCH"": P, I, T, C, H -> C is excluded (from ""crane""), so not allowed.

""FIGHT"": F, I, G, H, T -> letters are F,I,G,H,T. Check exclusions: none of these are excluded? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,O,U. So F,I,G,H,T are all allowed.

Positions: 
- F at pos1
- I at pos2
- G at pos3
- H at pos4
- T at pos5

But T is at position 5? We know that T cannot be at position 5 because of the feedback from ""shout"". So this word places T at position 5, which we know is wrong. Therefore, if we try it, we might get the same feedback for T? But we want to avoid known incorrect positions.

Moreover, we must not put T at position 5 because it's impossible.

Similarly, we must avoid H at position 2? In this word, H is at position 4, which is fine. But T at 5 is bad.

So ""FIGHT"" is not usable because T ends in position 5.

Try ""LIGHT"" again? But T is at 5.

What about switching positions? For example, ""TIGHT"": T, I, G, H, T -> has T repeated? ""TIGHT"" has T and then T again? Actually, ""tight"" has T at start and end? The word ""TIGHT"": T-I-G-H-T. It has two T's? Wait, TIGHT is spelled T-I-G-H-T, which is T, I, G, H, T -> positions: T at 1 and 5. 

But T at position 5? We cannot put T at position 5. Also, we have two T's? Not ideal for information.

Try words starting with T? But T cannot be at position 5, and we can put it elsewhere.

Another idea: ""MIGHTY"" is 6 letters, so no.

Possible words: 

- ""THUMB"" -> excludes: U is excluded? ""THUMB"": T,H,U,M,B -> U is excluded (because ""shout"" had U as x). So not allowed.

- ""DEPTH"" -> D,E,P,T,H -> E is excluded. No.

- ""WIDTH"" -> W,I,D,T,H -> letters: W, I, D, T, H -> all allowed? 
  Positions: W at1, I at2, D at3, T at4, H at5.

H at position 5? Wait, but in ""shout"" H was at 2 and wrong. We don't know about H at 5? Actually, we can place H at 5 because we only know it's not at 2. Similarly, T is at position 4? Is that allowed? We know T is not at position 5 (from ""shout""), but can be at 4.

So ""WIDTH"": 
- T is at position 4? Okay.
- H is at position 5? Okay because no prior feedback about H at 5.
- Letters: W, I, D, T, H.

But wait, we are going to use H and T? That's known to be in the word. So we can include them? But also we want to test new letters.

So ""WIDTH"" uses new letters: W, I, D.

Is ""width"" a valid English word? Yes.

We must check positions: 
- Position 1: W 
- Position 2: I 
- Position 3: D 
- Position 4: T 
- Position 5: H 

We know:
- T: previously at position 5 (in ""shout"") was misplaced, so T is not at pos 5. But in this word, T is at pos 4? That's fine.
- H: previously at position 2 was misplaced, and here it is at pos 5. We don't know about pos 5 for H? So it might be there.

Therefore, ""WIDTH"" is acceptable.

Alternatively, ""NIGHT"" -> N is excluded? From ""crane"", N is excluded? Yes. So no.

""LIGHT"" -> L,I,G,H,T: T at position 5, which we must avoid.

""FIGHT"" -> T at end? Same issue.

""PITHY"": P, I, T, H, Y -> letters: P,I,T,H,Y -> all allowed?
Positions: P at1, I2, T3, H4, Y5.

H is at4? Previous H was at2 (misplaced) -> but 4 is new? So okay.
T at position 3? Previous T was at5 (misplaced) -> so we don't know about position 3? So okay.

And T is at a new position (3 vs 5).

And Y is a new letter.

So ""PITHY"" is another option.

But ""width"" vs ""pithy""?

Both are valid. Let me choose one.

Another word: ""MIGHT"" -> M,I,G,H,T -> T at end? Position 5? Avoid.

""TIGER"": T,I,G,E,R but E and R are excluded? So no.

""THINK"": T,H,I,N,K -> N excluded? Yes from ""crane"".

So back to ""width"" or ""pithy"".

I think ""width"" is a good choice because it places T at position 4 and H at position 5? And it includes W,I,D.

But note that in ""shout"", H was misplaced? So we know H is not at position 2, but we don't know if it can be at 5? Similarly, T is not at 5? And here we put T at 4 and H at 5? Is that okay?

Yes.

Alternatively, ""PITHY"": puts T at 3, H at 4? So we test different positions.

But ""width"" tests the position for H at 5 and T at 4? Which are new.

But we also want to maximize using common letters? Perhaps.

Another idea: what about ""GHOST""? But O is excluded (from ""shout"" feedback: O x) and S is also excluded? So no.

So limited options.

Another word: ""FLINT"": F,L,I,N,T -> N excluded? N from ""crane"" is excluded.

How about ""BLITH"" ? Not a word.

""CHIPT""? No, C excluded.

""WIGHT"": W, I, G, H, T? But wait, T at end? Position 5? Again.

Unless we rearrange? We need a word that doesn't have T at the end and doesn't have H in position 2.

Let's try ""HITCH"": H at position 1? And C excluded? No.

""BIGHT"": B,I,G,H,T -> T at end? No.

It's hard to find words not ending in T? But there are words.

""THROW"": T,H,R,O,W -> R and O excluded? Yes.

So limited.

What about ""TWIXT"": T,W,I,X,T -> X is less common, and repeated T? ""twix"" is only 4. ""TWIXT"" is 5 letters? T-W-I-X-T? Actually, ""twist"" is 5 letters? ""TWIXT"" is spelled T-W-I-X-T? Yes, it's a word? But it has two T's and ends in T? Avoid position 5 for T.

Unless we place T elsewhere? But naturally, many words end with T? But we need words with T not at position 5.

Possible words starting with T?

For example, ""TIDYL"" not a word.

""TIMID"": T,I,M,I,D? Has I repeated? And excludes U? Wait, ""TIMID"": T,I,M,I,D -> letters: T,I,M,I,D -> M and D are new, but I repeated? Not ideal.

""TIGID"" not a word.

""VALID"": V,A,L,I,D -> A excluded? Yes.

""POINT"": P,O,I,N,T -> O excluded? Yes.

So back to ""width"" or ""pithy"".

Another option: ""DYING"": D,Y,I,N,G -> N excluded? No.

""DYING"" has N? So excluded.

""FIGHT"" was invalid because T at 5.

But if we need to avoid T at 5, then we could try ""THIEF"": T,H,I,E,F -> E excluded? Yes.

So very few words.

Consider ""PITHY"" : P-I-T-H-Y -> positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:T, 4:H, 5:Y.

Avoids T at 5? Here T is at position 3.

Avoids H at 2? Here H is at position 4.

And uses P,I,Y? All new letters.

""width"": W-I-D-T-H -> T at 4, H at 5? But H at 5 might be possible? And T at 4.

I think both are valid.

Let me choose ""PITHY"" because it doesn't end with T? Wait, but the word ""width"" has H at 5? So we can use it.

However, since we know T is not at position 5, we want to avoid that. But ""PITHY"" puts T at position 3? So it tests a new position for T? Which might be better? We don't know if T is at position 3 or 4? So testing both is okay.

But we have to pick one.

Another word: ""MIDTH""? Not a word.

""LITHD"" not a word.

So ""width"" and ""pithy"" are good candidates.

I think ""PITHY"" might be better because it tests H in position 4? And we know H is misplaced from position 2, so we can try position 4? Also, T in position 3? Which is different from its previous position 5? And Y is a new letter.

Whereas ""width"" tests T at 4 and H at 5? And we might end up placing H at 5 which might not be correct? But we don't know.

But either is fine.

I'll go with ""PITHY"" because it avoids the issue with T at position 5? Actually, ""PITHY"" doesn't have T at 5, so it's safe.

So let's guess ""PITHY"".

But ""pithy"" means concise? It's a valid English word.

So <guess>pithy</guess>

But let me double-check excluded letters: excluded are C,R,A,N,E,S,O,U. ""PITHY"" uses P,I,T,H,Y. None excluded. Good.

Positions: T at 3? Was not at 5? So okay? We haven't guessed T at 3 before? Similarly H at 4? Not at 2.

Yes.

But note: in ""shout"" we had T at position 5 and H at 2? Both were misplaced. So we need to put them elsewhere.

In ""pithy"": T at 3 is a new position for T? H at 4 is new? So we get information.

Similarly, we introduce P,I,Y as new letters.

So this should be fine.
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x): None of these letters are in the secret word.
- **Guess 2: shout** → S(x), H(-), O(x), U(x), T(-): 
  - S, O, U are not in the word.
  - H and T are in the word but in the wrong positions (H is not in position 2, T is not in position 5).

**Summary of Constraints:**
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, O, U (cannot be used).
- Must include: H and T (since they are in the word).
- H cannot be placed in position 2 (from ""shout"" feedback).
- T cannot be placed in position 5 (from ""shout"" feedback).
- New letters needed: Avoid repeating letters to maximize information gain. Prioritize common unused letters like P, I, Y, L, G, D, M, W, B, etc.

For the next guess, **PITHY** is chosen because:
- It includes required letters H and T.
- Positions: 
  - H is placed at position 4 (≠ position 2).
  - T is placed at position 3 (≠ position 5).
- New letters tested: P, I, Y.
- All letters (P, I, T, H, Y) are not excluded and are valid.
- ""Pithy"" is a common English word (meaning concise and forceful).

This guess efficiently tests new positions for H and T while introducing three new high-frequency letters (P, I, Y) to narrow down possibilities.

<guess>pithy</guess>",pithy,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"": all letters are wrong (x). So the secret word contains none of: C, R, A, N, E.
2. ""shout"": 
   - S: x -> not in the word
   - H: - -> in the word but wrong position
   - O: x -> not in the word
   - U: x -> not in the word
   - T: - -> in the word but wrong position

So from ""shout"", we know:
- H and T are in the word, but not in the positions they were guessed (H was in position 2, T in position 5).
- We also have new exclusions: S, O, U are not in the word.

Total letters that are definitely not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, S, O, U.

Letters that are in the word: H and T (and possibly others we haven't guessed).

Since H and T are misplaced, we need to include both in our next guess but in different positions.

Also, note that the secret word has 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but so far we don't have duplicates. Let's proceed.

We must avoid using the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, O, U.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that H and T must be in the word. So our next guess must include H and T, and three other new letters.

We want to maximize information by testing new letters.

Let's list more common letters: among the available ones, common ones are: L, I, D, G, M, P, B, F, Y, W.

We should try to cover as many as possible.

Possible words that contain H and T, and three other new letters from the available set.

But note: H and T cannot be in position 2 and 5 respectively? Actually, H was guessed in position 2 and was wrong, so in the secret word H is not at position 2. Similarly, T is not at position 5.

So in our next guess, we must put H in a position other than 2, and T in a position other than 5.

Moreover, we don't know where they might be.

We also need to pick a valid 5-letter word.

Let's brainstorm words that have H and T, and avoid C,R,A,N,E,S,O,U.

Possible words:

- LIGHT: L, I, G, H, T -> includes H and T, and L, I, G are new. But we have to check positions: H is at position 4, T at position 5. But note position 5 for T was wrong in ""shout"", so T can be in position 5? Actually, the previous feedback for T was at position 5 and it was '-' meaning it's in the word but not at that position? Or does it mean it's in the word but not necessarily that position?

Looking back at the rules: '-' means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. That includes that it might be present elsewhere, but definitely not in that specific position.

So for T in ""shout"" (position 5), it means T is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot place T at position 5 in the next guess? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not at position 5.

Similarly, H is not at position 2.

So for our next guess, we must choose positions for H and T that are not position 2 and not position 5 respectively? Actually, we can choose any positions except that we know H is not in position 2 and T is not in position 5.

But note: the word might have H elsewhere and T elsewhere.

So in ""LIGHT"": 
- H is at position 4, which is fine because we only know it's not at 2.
- T is at position 5, but we know T is not at position 5? Wait, the feedback from ""shout"": T was at position 5 and got '-', meaning T is not at position 5. So if we put T at position 5 again, it would be incorrect.

Therefore, we must avoid putting T at position 5. Similarly, avoid H at position 2.

In ""LIGHT"", T is at position 5, which we know is impossible. So this word is invalid for our purpose.

So we need a word that has:
- H: not in position 2
- T: not in position 5
- And uses three new letters from the available set.

Let's think of other words.

Consider ""THIGH"": but that has two H's and two G's? Actually, ""THIGH"": T, H, I, G, H -> repeated H? And it has two H's. But we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. However, we have only two known letters so far.

But to maximize information, avoid repeated letters if possible.

What about ""LITHG""? That's not a word.

Another idea: ""WHITE"": W, H, I, T, E -> but E is excluded because from ""crane"" we know E is not in the word. So no.

""PITCH"": P, I, T, C, H -> C is excluded (from ""crane""), so not allowed.

""FIGHT"": F, I, G, H, T -> letters are F,I,G,H,T. Check exclusions: none of these are excluded? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,O,U. So F,I,G,H,T are all allowed.

Positions: 
- F at pos1
- I at pos2
- G at pos3
- H at pos4
- T at pos5

But T is at position 5? We know that T cannot be at position 5 because of the feedback from ""shout"". So this word places T at position 5, which we know is wrong. Therefore, if we try it, we might get the same feedback for T? But we want to avoid known incorrect positions.

Moreover, we must not put T at position 5 because it's impossible.

Similarly, we must avoid H at position 2? In this word, H is at position 4, which is fine. But T at 5 is bad.

So ""FIGHT"" is not usable because T ends in position 5.

Try ""LIGHT"" again? But T is at 5.

What about switching positions? For example, ""TIGHT"": T, I, G, H, T -> has T repeated? ""TIGHT"" has T and then T again? Actually, ""tight"" has T at start and end? The word ""TIGHT"": T-I-G-H-T. It has two T's? Wait, TIGHT is spelled T-I-G-H-T, which is T, I, G, H, T -> positions: T at 1 and 5. 

But T at position 5? We cannot put T at position 5. Also, we have two T's? Not ideal for information.

Try words starting with T? But T cannot be at position 5, and we can put it elsewhere.

Another idea: ""MIGHTY"" is 6 letters, so no.

Possible words: 

- ""THUMB"" -> excludes: U is excluded? ""THUMB"": T,H,U,M,B -> U is excluded (because ""shout"" had U as x). So not allowed.

- ""DEPTH"" -> D,E,P,T,H -> E is excluded. No.

- ""WIDTH"" -> W,I,D,T,H -> letters: W, I, D, T, H -> all allowed? 
  Positions: W at1, I at2, D at3, T at4, H at5.

H at position 5? Wait, but in ""shout"" H was at 2 and wrong. We don't know about H at 5? Actually, we can place H at 5 because we only know it's not at 2. Similarly, T is at position 4? Is that allowed? We know T is not at position 5 (from ""shout""), but can be at 4.

So ""WIDTH"": 
- T is at position 4? Okay.
- H is at position 5? Okay because no prior feedback about H at 5.
- Letters: W, I, D, T, H.

But wait, we are going to use H and T? That's known to be in the word. So we can include them? But also we want to test new letters.

So ""WIDTH"" uses new letters: W, I, D.

Is ""width"" a valid English word? Yes.

We must check positions: 
- Position 1: W 
- Position 2: I 
- Position 3: D 
- Position 4: T 
- Position 5: H 

We know:
- T: previously at position 5 (in ""shout"") was misplaced, so T is not at pos 5. But in this word, T is at pos 4? That's fine.
- H: previously at position 2 was misplaced, and here it is at pos 5. We don't know about pos 5 for H? So it might be there.

Therefore, ""WIDTH"" is acceptable.

Alternatively, ""NIGHT"" -> N is excluded? From ""crane"", N is excluded? Yes. So no.

""LIGHT"" -> L,I,G,H,T: T at position 5, which we must avoid.

""FIGHT"" -> T at end? Same issue.

""PITHY"": P, I, T, H, Y -> letters: P,I,T,H,Y -> all allowed?
Positions: P at1, I2, T3, H4, Y5.

H is at4? Previous H was at2 (misplaced) -> but 4 is new? So okay.
T at position 3? Previous T was at5 (misplaced) -> so we don't know about position 3? So okay.

And T is at a new position (3 vs 5).

And Y is a new letter.

So ""PITHY"" is another option.

But ""width"" vs ""pithy""?

Both are valid. Let me choose one.

Another word: ""MIGHT"" -> M,I,G,H,T -> T at end? Position 5? Avoid.

""TIGER"": T,I,G,E,R but E and R are excluded? So no.

""THINK"": T,H,I,N,K -> N excluded? Yes from ""crane"".

So back to ""width"" or ""pithy"".

I think ""width"" is a good choice because it places T at position 4 and H at position 5? And it includes W,I,D.

But note that in ""shout"", H was misplaced? So we know H is not at position 2, but we don't know if it can be at 5? Similarly, T is not at 5? And here we put T at 4 and H at 5? Is that okay?

Yes.

Alternatively, ""PITHY"": puts T at 3, H at 4? So we test different positions.

So limited options.

Another word: ""FLINT"": F,L,I,N,T -> N excluded? N from ""crane"" is excluded.

How about ""BLITH"" ? Not a word.

""CHIPT""? No, C excluded.

""WIGHT"": W, I, G, H, T? But wait, T at end? Position 5? Again.

Unless we rearrange? We need a word that doesn't have T at the end and doesn't have H in position 2.

Let's try ""HITCH"": H at position 1? And C excluded? No.

""BIGHT"": B,I,G,H,T -> T at end? No.

It's hard to find words not ending in T? But there are words.

""THROW"": T,H,R,O,W -> R and O excluded? Yes.

So limited.

What about ""TWIXT"": T,W,I,X,T -> X is less common, and repeated T? ""twix"" is only 4. ""TWIXT"" is 5 letters? T-W-I-X-T? Actually, ""twist"" is 5 letters? ""TWIXT"" is spelled T-W-I-X-T? Yes, it's a word? But it has two T's and ends in T? Avoid position 5 for T.

Unless we place T elsewhere? But naturally, many words end with T? But we need words with T not at position 5.

Possible words starting with T?

For example, ""TIDYL"" not a word.

""TIMID"": T,I,M,I,D? Has I repeated? And excludes U? Wait, ""TIMID"": T,I,M,I,D -> letters: T,I,M,I,D -> M and D are new, but I repeated? Not ideal.

""TIGID"" not a word.

""VALID"": V,A,L,I,D -> A excluded? Yes.

""POINT"": P,O,I,N,T -> O excluded? Yes.

So back to ""width"" or ""pithy"".

Another option: ""DYING"": D,Y,I,N,G -> N excluded? No.

""DYING"" has N? So excluded.

""FIGHT"" was invalid because T at 5.

But if we need to avoid T at 5, then we could try ""THIEF"": T,H,I,E,F -> E excluded? Yes.

So very few words.

Consider ""PITHY"" : P-I-T-H-Y -> positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:T, 4:H, 5:Y.

Avoids T at 5? Here T is at position 3.

Avoids H at 2? Here H is at position 4.

And uses P,I,Y? All new letters.

""width"": W-I-D-T-H -> T at 4, H at 5? But H at 5 might be possible? And T at 4.

I think both are valid.

Let me choose ""PITHY"" because it doesn't end with T? Wait, but the word ""width"" has H at 5? So we can use it.

However, since we know T is not at position 5, we want to avoid that. But ""PITHY"" puts T at position 3? So it tests a new position for T? Which might be better? We don't know if T is at position 3 or 4? So testing both is okay.

But we have to pick one.

Another word: ""MIDTH""? Not a word.

""LITHD"" not a word.

So ""width"" and ""pithy"" are good candidates.

I think ""PITHY"" might be better because it tests H in position 4? And we know H is misplaced from position 2, so we can try position 4? Also, T in position 3? Which is different from its previous position 5? And Y is a new letter.

Whereas ""width"" tests T at 4 and H at 5? And we might end up placing H at 5 which might not be correct? But we don't know.

But either is fine.

I'll go with ""PITHY"" because it avoids the issue with T at position 5? Actually, ""PITHY"" doesn't have T at 5, so it's safe.

So let's guess ""PITHY"".

But ""pithy"" means concise? It's a valid English word.

So <guess>pithy</guess>

But let me double-check excluded letters: excluded are C,R,A,N,E,S,O,U. ""PITHY"" uses P,I,T,H,Y. None excluded. Good.

Positions: T at 3? Was not at 5? So okay? We haven't guessed T at 3 before? Similarly H at 4? Not at 2.

Yes.

But note: in ""shout"" we had T at position 5 and H at 2? Both were misplaced. So we need to put them elsewhere.

In ""pithy"": T at 3 is a new position for T? H at 4 is new? So we get information.

Similarly, we introduce P,I,Y as new letters.

So this should be fine.Based on the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x): None of these letters are in the secret word.
- **Guess 2: shout** → S(x), H(-), O(x), U(x), T(-): 
  - S, O, U are not in the word.
  - H and T are in the word but in the wrong positions (H is not in position 2, T is not in position 5).

**Summary of Constraints:**
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, O, U (cannot be used).
- Must include: H and T (since they are in the word).
- H cannot be placed in position 2 (from ""shout"" feedback).
- T cannot be placed in position 5 (from ""shout"" feedback).
- New letters needed: Avoid repeating letters to maximize information gain. Prioritize common unused letters like P, I, Y, L, G, D, M, W, B, etc.

For the next guess, **PITHY** is chosen because:
- It includes required letters H and T.
- Positions: 
  - H is placed at position 4 (≠ position 2).
  - T is placed at position 3 (≠ position 5).
- New letters tested: P, I, Y.
- All letters (P, I, T, H, Y) are not excluded and are valid.
- ""Pithy"" is a common English word (meaning concise and forceful).

This guess efficiently tests new positions for H and T while introducing three new high-frequency letters (P, I, Y) to narrow down possibilities.",Guess 3: pithy -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) I(✓) T(✓) H(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
