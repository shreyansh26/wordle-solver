We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need an initial guess.
 A good starting word should cover common letters and have a balanced letter distribution to maximize information.
 Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters and no duplicates.

<thinking>
For the first guess, I don't have any prior information since it's the start of the game. I should choose a word that:
- Contains common letters to maximize information gain
- Has no repeating letters to cover more unique letters
- Balances vowels and consonants

Common English letters include: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C.
Words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are often good starters.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has:
- C, R, N (common consonants)
- A and E (common vowels)
- All unique letters
- Covers positions that might reveal patterns early

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, from this we know:
- The letter 'A' is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since we placed it in the third position and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'A' and does not contain C, R, N, E.

For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, N, E (since they are absent).
- Includes the letter 'A' (since we know it's present) but in a different position (not position 3).
- We might also want to include other common letters to get more information.

Since we know 'A' is in the word, we can try to place it in a different position. Also, we should avoid the letters that we now know are absent.

Let's think of a word that:
- Has 5 letters, all different to maximize information (if possible).
- Contains 'A' but not in the third position.
- Avoids C, R, N, E.

Common vowels besides 'A' and 'E' (which is out) are 'I', 'O', 'U'. But we also have consonants.

We can try to use other common letters: S, T, L, P, H, etc.

One common starting word is ""salet"", but note that we have to avoid R and E. So ""salet"" has E and R? Actually, ""salet"" has E and T? Let me check: S, A, L, E, T. But E is out, so we cannot use E.

Another common word is ""audio"" but that has 5 vowels and we know A is present, but we need more consonants.

Alternatively, we can try ""stamp"":
- S, T, A, M, P
- A is in the third position? But in our previous guess, A was in the third position and it was misplaced. So in the secret word, A is not in the third position. Therefore, we should put A in a different position.

Let me try to put A in the second position? Or the first? Or the fourth? Or the fifth?

We don't know, so we can try a word that has A in a different position, say the second.

For example, ""laugh"": but note that we have to avoid R, and also G and H are common? But we don't know about them.

But we also want to test other common letters.

Another idea: since we know A is present, and we have only one known letter, we can try to use a word that has A and four new letters.

Let me list some words without C, R, N, E and with A in a position other than 3.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

Let me try to form a word with A in the second position: for example, ""palsy"": P, A, L, S, Y. But we don't know about P, L, S, Y.

Alternatively, ""fault"": F, A, U, L, T. But we don't know about F, U, L, T.

But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N, E.

So, let's try to choose a word that has A and also includes other common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as S, T, L, I, O, etc.

I think ""staid"" is a good candidate? But let's check: S, T, A, I, D. 
- A is in the third position? We want to avoid the third position because in the secret word A is not in the third. But wait, in our first guess we had A in the third and it was misplaced, meaning the secret word has A but not in the third. So in the next guess, we should put A in a different position.

Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the third position again.

So for ""staid"", A is in the third? That's the same as before. We don't want that.

How about ""aisle"": A, I, S, L, E -> but E is out! We cannot use E.

Another word: ""aloft"": A, L, O, F, T -> A is in the first position. This is good because we haven't tested A in the first position.

But we don't know about L, O, F, T.

Alternatively, ""about"": A, B, O, U, T -> A in first. But we don't know about B, O, U, T.

But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another common word: ""adieu"" but that has E? No, ""adieu"" is A, D, I, E, U -> E is out, so we cannot use.

How about ""audio"": A, U, D, I, O -> that's all vowels? But we know A is present, and we can test U, D, I, O.

But we might get less information because vowels are less frequent? However, we have to avoid consonants that we haven't tested? Actually, we haven't tested many consonants.

Alternatively, we can try ""piano"": P, I, A, N, O -> but N is out! We know N is absent. So we cannot use N.

We must avoid N.

So let me think of words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E.

Here's a list of possible words without C, R, N, E and with A not in the third position:

- Position 1: A, then four other letters (not C, R, N, E). Examples: ""about"", ""above"" (but V and B? and O, U, T), ""adapt"" (but D, A, P, T; but A is in first and third? We don't want A in third? Actually, we can have A in multiple positions? But the word must be valid. However, we know the secret word has at least one A, but we don't know if it has more. But in ""adapt"", we have two A's? But we don't know if the secret word has two A's. Also, we are avoiding C, R, N, E, so ""adapt"" is A, D, A, P, T? Wait, that's two A's. But the word ""adapt"" has A in first and third. We are trying to test A in a new position, but we are also putting it in the third again? We want to avoid the third because we know the secret word's A is not in the third? Actually, we don't know if there is a second A. But we are only sure about one A. So it's okay to put A in the third again? But that might not be efficient because we already know that the A is not in the third. So if we put A in the third again and it shows as absent (x) or correct (✓)? Actually, if we put A in the third and it is the same A we already know, then it should be either misplaced again (if the secret word has only one A and it's not in third) or correct (if the secret word has two A's and one is in third). But we don't know. However, to maximize information, it's better to try A in a new position.

So I think we should avoid the third position for A in this guess.

Therefore, let's look for words that have A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and avoid C, R, N, E.

Another idea: ""salty"": S, A, L, T, Y -> A in second position. This avoids the third. And the letters S, L, T, Y are new.

But we don't know about S, L, T, Y.

Alternatively, ""focal"" but has C and L? C is out, so we cannot use C.

We must avoid C.

So ""salty"" seems good: S, A, L, T, Y.

But we also have the option to test more common letters. The most common consonants in English are T, N, S, H, R, ... but we know N and R are out. So T and S are very common.

Therefore, ""salty"" is a good candidate.

Another word: ""patio"": P, A, T, I, O -> A in second position. This also tests P, T, I, O.

But we don't know about P, T, I, O.

I think both are good. Let me choose one.

Alternatively, we can use ""stamp"" but then A is in the third? We don't want that. So avoid.

How about ""tally"": T, A, L, L, Y -> but has double L? That might not be ideal because we get less information about distinct letters. So better to have all distinct letters.

""Salty"" has distinct letters: S, A, L, T, Y.

""Patio"" has distinct: P, A, T, I, O.

I think ""patio"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (A and I, O) and two common consonants (P, T). But we already know A is present, so we are testing I, O, P, T.

But ""salty"" has S, A, L, T, Y. S and T are very common.

I think I'll go with ""salty"" because it has S and T which are high frequency.

But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N, E. ""salty"" does not contain any of these.

So let's choose ""salty"".

But wait, we have to consider that the secret word has an A that is not in the third position. In ""salty"", we are putting A in the second position. That's a new position.

Therefore, I will guess ""salty"".

But let me double-check: 
- First guess: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
- So we know A is present and not in position 3.

Now, with ""salty"":
- If the A in the second position is correct, we get a ✓ for A.
- If not, we might get a '-' for A (if the secret word has A but not in second) or even an 'x' (if there is only one A and it's not in second, but we know there is at least one A so it would be '-' if not in second? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one A and it is in a position that is not second, then we would get '-' for A because it is present but misplaced. But if we get an 'x' for A, that would mean there is no A at all? But we know there is an A, so we should never get an 'x' for A. Therefore, for A we can only get either ✓ (if it's in the second position) or '-' (if it's in the word but not in second). But note: we are putting A in the second position, and we know the secret word has an A that is not in the third. It could be in the second? We don't know.

So by putting A in the second, we are testing if the A is in the second position.

Also, we are testing S, L, T, Y.

Therefore, I think ""salty"" is a good guess.

Alternatively, we could try to put A in the first position? For example, ""about"". But we don't know about B, O, U, T.

I think ""salty"" is fine.

So my next guess: ""salty""
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked as ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, R, N, E.
- Include A, but not in the third position to test a new location.
- Choose a word with common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, Y) to maximize information.
- ""salty"" fits these criteria: A is in the second position, and it tests new letters (S, L, T, Y) while avoiding the excluded letters.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, from this we know:
- The letter 'A' is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since we placed it in the third position and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'A' and does not contain C, R, N, E.

For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, N, E (since they are absent).
- Includes the letter 'A' (since we know it's present) but in a different position (not position 3).
- We might also want to include other common letters to get more information.

Since we know 'A' is in the word, we can try to place it in a different position. Also, we should avoid the letters that we now know are absent.

Let's think of a word that:
- Has 5 letters, all different to maximize information (if possible).
- Contains 'A' but not in the third position.
- Avoids C, R, N, E.

Common vowels besides 'A' and 'E' (which is out) are 'I', 'O', 'U'. But we also have consonants.

We can try to use other common letters: S, T, L, P, H, etc.

One common starting word is ""salet"", but note that we have to avoid R and E. So ""salet"" has E and R? Actually, ""salet"" has E and T? Let me check: S, A, L, E, T. But E is out, so we cannot use E.

Another common word is ""audio"" but that has 5 vowels and we know A is present, but we need more consonants.

Alternatively, we can try ""stamp"":
- S, T, A, M, P
- A is in the third position? But in our previous guess, A was in the third position and it was misplaced. So in the secret word, A is not in the third position. Therefore, we should put A in a different position.

Let me try to put A in the second position? Or the first? Or the fourth? Or the fifth?

We don't know, so we can try a word that has A in a different position, say the second.

For example, ""laugh"": but note that we have to avoid R, and also G and H are common? But we don't know about them.

But we also want to test other common letters.

Another idea: since we know A is present, and we have only one known letter, we can try to use a word that has A and four new letters.

Let me list some words without C, R, N, E and with A in a position other than 3.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

Let me try to form a word with A in the second position: for example, ""palsy"": P, A, L, S, Y. But we don't know about P, L, S, Y.

Alternatively, ""fault"": F, A, U, L, T. But we don't know about F, U, L, T.

But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N, E.

So, let's try to choose a word that has A and also includes other common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as S, T, L, I, O, etc.

I think ""staid"" is a good candidate? But let's check: S, T, A, I, D. 
- A is in the third position? We want to avoid the third position because in the secret word A is not in the third. But wait, in our first guess we had A in the third and it was misplaced, meaning the secret word has A but not in the third. So in the next guess, we should put A in a different position.

Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the third position again.

So for ""staid"", A is in the third? That's the same as before. We don't want that.

How about ""aisle"": A, I, S, L, E -> but E is out! We cannot use E.

Another word: ""aloft"": A, L, O, F, T -> A is in the first position. This is good because we haven't tested A in the first position.

But we don't know about L, O, F, T.

Alternatively, ""about"": A, B, O, U, T -> A in first. But we don't know about B, O, U, T.

But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another common word: ""adieu"" but that has E? No, ""adieu"" is A, D, I, E, U -> E is out, so we cannot use.

How about ""audio"": A, U, D, I, O -> that's all vowels? But we know A is present, and we can test U, D, I, O.

But we might get less information because vowels are less frequent? However, we have to avoid consonants that we haven't tested? Actually, we haven't tested many consonants.

Alternatively, we can try ""piano"": P, I, A, N, O -> but N is out! We know N is absent. So we cannot use N.

We must avoid N.

So let me think of words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E.

Here's a list of possible words without C, R, N, E and with A not in the third position:

- Position 1: A, then four other letters (not C, R, N, E). Examples: ""about"", ""above"" (but V and B? and O, U, T), ""adapt"" (but D, A, P, T; but A is in first and third? We don't want A in third? Actually, we can have A in multiple positions? But the word must be valid. However, we know the secret word has at least one A, but we don't know if it has more. But in ""adapt"", we have two A's? But we don't know if the secret word has two A's. Also, we are avoiding C, R, N, E, so ""adapt"" is A, D, A, P, T? Wait, that's two A's. But the word ""adapt"" has A in first and third. We are trying to test A in a new position, but we are also putting it in the third again? We want to avoid the third because we know the secret word's A is not in the third? Actually, we don't know if there is a second A. But we are only sure about one A. So it's okay to put A in the third again? But that might not be efficient because we already know that the A is not in the third. So if we put A in the third again and it shows as absent (x) or correct (✓)? Actually, if we put A in the third and it is the same A we already know, then it should be either misplaced again (if the secret word has only one A and it's not in third) or correct (if the secret word has two A's and one is in third). But we don't know. However, to maximize information, it's better to try A in a new position.

So I think we should avoid the third position for A in this guess.

Therefore, let's look for words that have A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and avoid C, R, N, E.

Another idea: ""salty"": S, A, L, T, Y -> A in second position. This avoids the third. And the letters S, L, T, Y are new.

But we don't know about S, L, T, Y.

Alternatively, ""focal"" but has C and L? C is out, so we cannot use C.

We must avoid C.

So ""salty"" seems good: S, A, L, T, Y.

But we also have the option to test more common letters. The most common consonants in English are T, N, S, H, R, ... but we know N and R are out. So T and S are very common.

Therefore, ""salty"" is a good candidate.

Another word: ""patio"": P, A, T, I, O -> A in second position. This also tests P, T, I, O.

But we don't know about P, T, I, O.

I think both are good. Let me choose one.

Alternatively, we can use ""stamp"" but then A is in the third? We don't want that. So avoid.

How about ""tally"": T, A, L, L, Y -> but has double L? That might not be ideal because we get less information about distinct letters. So better to have all distinct letters.

""Salty"" has distinct letters: S, A, L, T, Y.

""Patio"" has distinct: P, A, T, I, O.

I think ""patio"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (A and I, O) and two common consonants (P, T). But we already know A is present, so we are testing I, O, P, T.

But ""salty"" has S, A, L, T, Y. S and T are very common.

I think I'll go with ""salty"" because it has S and T which are high frequency.

But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N, E. ""salty"" does not contain any of these.

So let's choose ""salty"".

But wait, we have to consider that the secret word has an A that is not in the third position. In ""salty"", we are putting A in the second position. That's a new position.

Therefore, I will guess ""salty"".

But let me double-check: 
- First guess: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
- So we know A is present and not in position 3.

Now, with ""salty"":
- If the A in the second position is correct, we get a ✓ for A.
- If not, we might get a '-' for A (if the secret word has A but not in second) or even an 'x' (if there is only one A and it's not in second, but we know there is at least one A so it would be '-' if not in second? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one A and it is in a position that is not second, then we would get '-' for A because it is present but misplaced. But if we get an 'x' for A, that would mean there is no A at all? But we know there is an A, so we should never get an 'x' for A. Therefore, for A we can only get either ✓ (if it's in the second position) or '-' (if it's in the word but not in second). But note: we are putting A in the second position, and we know the secret word has an A that is not in the third. It could be in the second? We don't know.

So by putting A in the second, we are testing if the A is in the second position.

Also, we are testing S, L, T, Y.

Therefore, I think ""salty"" is a good guess.

Alternatively, we could try to put A in the first position? For example, ""about"". But we don't know about B, O, U, T.

I think ""salty"" is fine.

So my next guess: ""salty""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked as ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, R, N, E.
- Include A, but not in the third position to test a new location.
- Choose a word with common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, Y) to maximize information.
- ""salty"" fits these criteria: A is in the second position, and it tests new letters (S, L, T, Y) while avoiding the excluded letters.

Actually, no: if the secret word has only one A and it is in a position that is not second, then we would get \'-\' for A because it is present but misplaced. But if we get an \'x\' for A, that would mean there is no A at all? But we know there is an A, so we should never get an \'x\' for A. Therefore, for A we can only get either ✓ (if it\'s in the second position) or \'-\' (if it\'s in the word but not in second). But note: we are putting A in the second position, and we know the secret word has an A that is not in the third. It could be in the second?

We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"" : C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
2. ""salty"" : S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)

From the feedback, we know:
- The letter 'A' is in the secret word and in the correct position. From ""salty"", A is in the second position and got a ✓. So the second letter of the secret word is A.
- From ""salty"": S, L, T, Y are all absent (x). So S, L, T, Y are not in the secret word.
- From ""crane"": C, R, E are absent (x) and N is also absent. So we know the secret word does not contain C, R, E, N, and now also S, L, T, Y.

Therefore, the set of excluded letters is: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y.

And we know that the second letter is A.

So the secret word pattern is: _ A _ _ _

Now, what letters can be used? We need to avoid the excluded letters: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y.

Also, we have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, T, Y in our guesses. Note that A is confirmed and placed, so for the other positions, we need new letters.

The alphabet minus the excluded letters: 
Excluded: C, E, N, R, S, T, L, Y. That's 8 letters.
Remaining letters: A (but already placed), B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But A is already used and placed correctly, so for the other positions, we use letters from the remaining set: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Also, we know from the first guess that A was misplaced in position 3 (from ""crane""), but now we know the secret word has A in position 2. And since we got a ✓ for A in position 2 in ""salty"", that means the A in position 3 in ""crane"" was not correct and there might be only one A? But wait, it's possible that the word has two A's? However, in the feedback for ""crane"", we got a '-' for A in position 3, meaning it's present but not in position 3. But now we have an A in position 2 confirmed. So if the word has only one A, then that A is in position 2, so any other A would get an x? But in ""salty"", we placed A only in position 2, and other positions had other letters. But we didn't place A elsewhere.

So we don't know if there are more A's. But since the word must have an A and it is in position 2, the '-' for A in position 3 from ""crane"" could be because that A is the same one? But no, because if there is only one A, then when we put it in position 3 in ""crane"", it should be '-' meaning it exists elsewhere, and now we found it in position 2. So if we put A in position 3 again, it should be x? But we know it's not in position 3. So we can avoid having A in other positions? Or test for another A.

But for now, let's assume there might be only one A until proven otherwise.

Now, the secret word is _ A _ _ _

We need to find a word that fits: 
Second letter is A.
Does not contain: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y (and the other excluded letters).

Also, we haven't tested many letters, so we should choose a word with as many new common letters as possible from the remaining set.

Common letters from the remaining: vowels I and O, consonants B, D, F, G, H, M, P, etc.

Possible words: we need a word of the form ?A???.

Examples: 
- ""gaudy"" but Y is excluded? Y is in the excluded list. So not.
- ""happy"" but P? and Y excluded.
- ""daddy"" but D? and Y excluded and double D? Not great because we want distinct letters to maximize info? But not necessary.

But we need to avoid the excluded letters.

I think ""bacon"" but C and N are excluded? Not.

Another: ""fable"" but E is excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""habit"": H, A, B, I, T -> but T is excluded? T is in the excluded list. So no.

Excluded: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y.

So avoid T.

Possible words: ""manor"" but M, A, N, O, R -> but N and R excluded? R is excluded.

Not.

""papal"" but P, A, P, A, L -> L excluded? L and doubled P and A.

But L is excluded.

We need to find a word with second letter A and no C,R,E,N,S,L,T,Y.

Let me try: ""kabob"" but K? and B? but O? Also, it has two B's and two O's? not efficient.

Perhaps ""radio"" but R excluded? R is excluded.

""magic"" but C excluded.

This is tricky.

Another: ""haiku"": H, A, I, K, U -> letters: H, I, K, U are not excluded. And A is in second.

So ""haiku"": 
- H, A, I, K, U

All letters are allowed: H, A, I, K, U. A is in second.

Now, H, I, K, U are new letters.

This seems like a valid word.

Other options: 
- ""fairy"" but R and Y excluded? Not.
- ""giant"" but T excluded? Not.
- ""bakes"" but S excluded? Not.

""quake"" but E excluded? Not.

""vapid"": V, A, P, I, D -> V, P, I, D are new and not excluded.

""vapid"" is a word.

But ""haiku"" and ""vapid"" are both options.

Also, ""habit"" has T excluded? Not.

Another: ""daisy"" but S and Y excluded? Not.

We could try ""jacks"" but C and S excluded? Not.

So ""haiku"" or ""vapid""?

I think ""haiku"" is more common? Or not, but it is a word.

To test vowels: I and U. Or consonants: H, K.

Similarly, ""vapid"" has V, P, I, D. V and P are less common.

But we want to test common letters? But we have few options.

Another possibility: ""balmy"" but L and Y excluded? Not.

""cabin"" but C and N excluded? Not.

""habit"" is invalid because of T.

How about ""manic"" but C and N excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""waist"" but S and T excluded? Not.

So I think ""haiku"" is a reasonable choice.

Alternatively, ""capri"" but C and R excluded? Not.

So I'll go with ""haiku"".

Therefore, next guess: ""haiku""

But note: the secret word has at least one A, and we are putting A in the second position which is correct.

Now, we are testing H, I, K, U in positions 1, 3, 4, 5.

If any of these are present and in the correct position, we get ✓, or misplaced, we get '-'.

This should give us good information.

But wait: we know from the first guess that A was in the wrong position at position 3. Now that we have placed A correctly at position 2, so in the first guess, A was at position 3 and was misplaced, meaning the secret word's A is not at position 3. Therefore, in ""haiku"", if the secret word has another A? But we are not placing any other A. But in position 3, we are placing I, so that's fine. Since we know position 3 cannot have A (because from the first feedback), so we should not put A there anyway.

So I think ""haiku"" is a good guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""haiku"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- From ""crane"": C, R, N, E are not in the secret word, and A is present but not in position 3.
- From ""salty"": S, L, T, Y are not in the secret word, and A is confirmed in position 2.

The secret word has the pattern: _ A _ _ _, and excludes the letters C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y. The next guess should prioritize testing new common vowels and consonants from the remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z) to gain maximum information.

""Haiku"" is chosen as the next guess because:
- It fits the pattern (_ A _ _ _) and avoids excluded letters.
- It introduces four new untested letters: H, I, K, U.
- It tests common vowels (I and U) and consonants (H and K) that may reveal positions or presence in the secret word.
- Since A is already confirmed in position 2, the focus shifts to solving the other positions efficiently.

<guess>haiku</guess>",haiku,"We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"" : C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
2. ""salty"" : S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)

From the feedback, we know:
- The letter 'A' is in the secret word and in the correct position. From ""salty"", A is in the second position and got a ✓. So the second letter of the secret word is A.
- From ""salty"": S, L, T, Y are all absent (x). So S, L, T, Y are not in the secret word.
- From ""crane"": C, R, E are absent (x) and N is also absent. So we know the secret word does not contain C, R, E, N, and now also S, L, T, Y.

Therefore, the set of excluded letters is: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y.

And we know that the second letter is A.

So the secret word pattern is: _ A _ _ _

Now, what letters can be used? We need to avoid the excluded letters: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y.

Also, we have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, T, Y in our guesses. Note that A is confirmed and placed, so for the other positions, we need new letters.

The alphabet minus the excluded letters: 
Excluded: C, E, N, R, S, T, L, Y. That's 8 letters.
Remaining letters: A (but already placed), B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But A is already used and placed correctly, so for the other positions, we use letters from the remaining set: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Also, we know from the first guess that A was misplaced in position 3 (from ""crane""), but now we know the secret word has A in position 2. And since we got a ✓ for A in position 2 in ""salty"", that means the A in position 3 in ""crane"" was not correct and there might be only one A? But wait, it's possible that the word has two A's? However, in the feedback for ""crane"", we got a '-' for A in position 3, meaning it's present but not in position 3. But now we have an A in position 2 confirmed. So if the word has only one A, then that A is in position 2, so any other A would get an x? But in ""salty"", we placed A only in position 2, and other positions had other letters. But we didn't place A elsewhere.

So we don't know if there are more A's. But since the word must have an A and it is in position 2, the '-' for A in position 3 from ""crane"" could be because that A is the same one? But no, because if there is only one A, then when we put it in position 3 in ""crane"", it should be '-' meaning it exists elsewhere, and now we found it in position 2. So if we put A in position 3 again, it should be x? But we know it's not in position 3. So we can avoid having A in other positions? Or test for another A.

But for now, let's assume there might be only one A until proven otherwise.

Now, the secret word is _ A _ _ _

We need to find a word that fits:

Therefore, next guess: ""haiku""

But note: the secret word has at least one A, and we are putting A in the second position which is correct.

Now, we are testing H, I, K, U in positions 1, 3, 4, 5.

If any of these are present and in the correct position, we get ✓, or misplaced, we get '-'.

This should give us good information.

But wait: we know from the first guess that A was in the wrong position at position 3.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, from this we know:
- The letter 'A' is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since we placed it in the third position and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'A' and does not contain C, R, N, E.

For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, N, E (since they are absent).
- Includes the letter 'A' (since we know it's present) but in a different position (not position 3).
- We might also want to include other common letters to get more information.

Since we know 'A' is in the word, we can try to place it in a different position. Also, we should avoid the letters that we now know are absent.

Let's think of a word that:
- Has 5 letters, all different to maximize information (if possible).
- Contains 'A' but not in the third position.
- Avoids C, R, N, E.

Common vowels besides 'A' and 'E' (which is out) are 'I', 'O', 'U'. But we also have consonants.

We can try to use other common letters: S, T, L, P, H, etc.

One common starting word is ""salet"", but note that we have to avoid R and E. So ""salet"" has E and R? Actually, ""salet"" has E and T? Let me check: S, A, L, E, T. But E is out, so we cannot use E.

Another common word is ""audio"" but that has 5 vowels and we know A is present, but we need more consonants.

Alternatively, we can try ""stamp"":
- S, T, A, M, P
- A is in the third position? But in our previous guess, A was in the third position and it was misplaced. So in the secret word, A is not in the third position. Therefore, we should put A in a different position.

Let me try to put A in the second position? Or the first? Or the fourth? Or the fifth?

We don't know, so we can try a word that has A in a different position, say the second.

For example, ""laugh"": but note that we have to avoid R, and also G and H are common? But we don't know about them.

But we also want to test other common letters.

Another idea: since we know A is present, and we have only one known letter, we can try to use a word that has A and four new letters.

Let me list some words without C, R, N, E and with A in a position other than 3.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

Let me try to form a word with A in the second position: for example, ""palsy"": P, A, L, S, Y. But we don't know about P, L, S, Y.

Alternatively, ""fault"": F, A, U, L, T. But we don't know about F, U, L, T.

But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N, E.

So, let's try to choose a word that has A and also includes other common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as S, T, L, I, O, etc.

I think ""staid"" is a good candidate? But let's check: S, T, A, I, D. 
- A is in the third position? We want to avoid the third position because in the secret word A is not in the third. But wait, in our first guess we had A in the third and it was misplaced, meaning the secret word has A but not in the third. So in the next guess, we should put A in a different position.

Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the third position again.

So for ""staid"", A is in the third? That's the same as before. We don't want that.

How about ""aisle"": A, I, S, L, E -> but E is out! We cannot use E.

Another word: ""aloft"": A, L, O, F, T -> A is in the first position. This is good because we haven't tested A in the first position.

But we don't know about L, O, F, T.

Alternatively, ""about"": A, B, O, U, T -> A in first. But we don't know about B, O, U, T.

But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another common word: ""adieu"" but that has E? No, ""adieu"" is A, D, I, E, U -> E is out, so we cannot use.

How about ""audio"": A, U, D, I, O -> that's all vowels? But we know A is present, and we can test U, D, I, O.

But we might get less information because vowels are less frequent? However, we have to avoid consonants that we haven't tested? Actually, we haven't tested many consonants.

Alternatively, we can try ""piano"": P, I, A, N, O -> but N is out! We know N is absent. So we cannot use N.

We must avoid N.

So let me think of words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E.

Here's a list of possible words without C, R, N, E and with A not in the third position:

- Position 1: A, then four other letters (not C, R, N, E). Examples: ""about"", ""above"" (but V and B? and O, U, T), ""adapt"" (but D, A, P, T; but A is in first and third? We don't want A in third? Actually, we can have A in multiple positions? But the word must be valid. However, we know the secret word has at least one A, but we don't know if it has more. But in ""adapt"", we have two A's? But we don't know if the secret word has two A's. Also, we are avoiding C, R, N, E, so ""adapt"" is A, D, A, P, T? Wait, that's two A's. But the word ""adapt"" has A in first and third. We are trying to test A in a new position, but we are also putting it in the third again? We want to avoid the third because we know the secret word's A is not in the third? Actually, we don't know if there is a second A. But we are only sure about one A. So it's okay to put A in the third again? But that might not be efficient because we already know that the A is not in the third. So if we put A in the third again and it shows as absent (x) or correct (✓)? Actually, if we put A in the third and it is the same A we already know, then it should be either misplaced again (if the secret word has only one A and it's not in third) or correct (if the secret word has two A's and one is in third). But we don't know. However, to maximize information, it's better to try A in a new position.

So I think we should avoid the third position for A in this guess.

Therefore, let's look for words that have A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and avoid C, R, N, E.

Another idea: ""salty"": S, A, L, T, Y -> A in second position. This avoids the third. And the letters S, L, T, Y are new.

But we don't know about S, L, T, Y.

Alternatively, ""focal"" but has C and L? C is out, so we cannot use C.

We must avoid C.

So ""salty"" seems good: S, A, L, T, Y.

But we also have the option to test more common letters. The most common consonants in English are T, N, S, H, R, ... but we know N and R are out. So T and S are very common.

Therefore, ""salty"" is a good candidate.

Another word: ""patio"": P, A, T, I, O -> A in second position. This also tests P, T, I, O.

But we don't know about P, T, I, O.

I think both are good. Let me choose one.

Alternatively, we can use ""stamp"" but then A is in the third? We don't want that. So avoid.

How about ""tally"": T, A, L, L, Y -> but has double L? That might not be ideal because we get less information about distinct letters. So better to have all distinct letters.

""Salty"" has distinct letters: S, A, L, T, Y.

""Patio"" has distinct: P, A, T, I, O.

I think ""patio"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (A and I, O) and two common consonants (P, T). But we already know A is present, so we are testing I, O, P, T.

But ""salty"" has S, A, L, T, Y. S and T are very common.

I think I'll go with ""salty"" because it has S and T which are high frequency.

But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N, E. ""salty"" does not contain any of these.

So let's choose ""salty"".

But wait, we have to consider that the secret word has an A that is not in the third position. In ""salty"", we are putting A in the second position. That's a new position.

Therefore, I will guess ""salty"".

But let me double-check: 
- First guess: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
- So we know A is present and not in position 3.

Now, with ""salty"":
- If the A in the second position is correct, we get a ✓ for A.
- If not, we might get a '-' for A (if the secret word has A but not in second) or even an 'x' (if there is only one A and it's not in second, but we know there is at least one A so it would be '-' if not in second? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one A and it is in a position that is not second, then we would get '-' for A because it is present but misplaced. But if we get an 'x' for A, that would mean there is no A at all? But we know there is an A, so we should never get an 'x' for A. Therefore, for A we can only get either ✓ (if it's in the second position) or '-' (if it's in the word but not in second). But note: we are putting A in the second position, and we know the secret word has an A that is not in the third. It could be in the second? We don't know.

So by putting A in the second, we are testing if the A is in the second position.

Also, we are testing S, L, T, Y.

Therefore, I think ""salty"" is a good guess.

Alternatively, we could try to put A in the first position? For example, ""about"". But we don't know about B, O, U, T.

I think ""salty"" is fine.

So my next guess: ""salty""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked as ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, R, N, E.
- Include A, but not in the third position to test a new location.
- Choose a word with common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, Y) to maximize information.
- ""salty"" fits these criteria: A is in the second position, and it tests new letters (S, L, T, Y) while avoiding the excluded letters.

<guess>salty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"" : C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
2. ""salty"" : S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)

From the feedback, we know:
- The letter 'A' is in the secret word and in the correct position. From ""salty"", A is in the second position and got a ✓. So the second letter of the secret word is A.
- From ""salty"": S, L, T, Y are all absent (x). So S, L, T, Y are not in the secret word.
- From ""crane"": C, R, E are absent (x) and N is also absent. So we know the secret word does not contain C, R, E, N, and now also S, L, T, Y.

Therefore, the set of excluded letters is: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y.

And we know that the second letter is A.

So the secret word pattern is: _ A _ _ _

Now, what letters can be used? We need to avoid the excluded letters: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y.

Also, we have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, T, Y in our guesses. Note that A is confirmed and placed, so for the other positions, we need new letters.

The alphabet minus the excluded letters: 
Excluded: C, E, N, R, S, T, L, Y. That's 8 letters.
Remaining letters: A (but already placed), B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But A is already used and placed correctly, so for the other positions, we use letters from the remaining set: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Also, we know from the first guess that A was misplaced in position 3 (from ""crane""), but now we know the secret word has A in position 2. And since we got a ✓ for A in position 2 in ""salty"", that means the A in position 3 in ""crane"" was not correct and there might be only one A? But wait, it's possible that the word has two A's? However, in the feedback for ""crane"", we got a '-' for A in position 3, meaning it's present but not in position 3. But now we have an A in position 2 confirmed. So if the word has only one A, then that A is in position 2, so any other A would get an x? But in ""salty"", we placed A only in position 2, and other positions had other letters. But we didn't place A elsewhere.

So we don't know if there are more A's. But since the word must have an A and it is in position 2, the '-' for A in position 3 from ""crane"" could be because that A is the same one? But no, because if there is only one A, then when we put it in position 3 in ""crane"", it should be '-' meaning it exists elsewhere, and now we found it in position 2. So if we put A in position 3 again, it should be x? But we know it's not in position 3. So we can avoid having A in other positions? Or test for another A.

But for now, let's assume there might be only one A until proven otherwise.

Now, the secret word is _ A _ _ _

We need to find a word that fits: 
Second letter is A.
Does not contain: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y (and the other excluded letters).

Also, we haven't tested many letters, so we should choose a word with as many new common letters as possible from the remaining set.

Common letters from the remaining: vowels I and O, consonants B, D, F, G, H, M, P, etc.

Possible words: we need a word of the form ?A???.

Examples: 
- ""gaudy"" but Y is excluded? Y is in the excluded list. So not.
- ""happy"" but P? and Y excluded.
- ""daddy"" but D? and Y excluded and double D? Not great because we want distinct letters to maximize info? But not necessary.

But we need to avoid the excluded letters.

I think ""bacon"" but C and N are excluded? Not.

Another: ""fable"" but E is excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""habit"": H, A, B, I, T -> but T is excluded? T is in the excluded list. So no.

Excluded: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y.

So avoid T.

Possible words: ""manor"" but M, A, N, O, R -> but N and R excluded? R is excluded.

Not.

""papal"" but P, A, P, A, L -> L excluded? L and doubled P and A.

But L is excluded.

We need to find a word with second letter A and no C,R,E,N,S,L,T,Y.

Let me try: ""kabob"" but K? and B? but O? Also, it has two B's and two O's? not efficient.

Perhaps ""radio"" but R excluded? R is excluded.

""magic"" but C excluded.

This is tricky.

Another: ""haiku"": H, A, I, K, U -> letters: H, I, K, U are not excluded. And A is in second.

So ""haiku"": 
- H, A, I, K, U

All letters are allowed: H, A, I, K, U. A is in second.

Now, H, I, K, U are new letters.

This seems like a valid word.

Other options: 
- ""fairy"" but R and Y excluded? Not.
- ""giant"" but T excluded? Not.
- ""bakes"" but S excluded? Not.

""quake"" but E excluded? Not.

""vapid"": V, A, P, I, D -> V, P, I, D are new and not excluded.

""vapid"" is a word.

But ""haiku"" and ""vapid"" are both options.

Also, ""habit"" has T excluded? Not.

Another: ""daisy"" but S and Y excluded? Not.

We could try ""jacks"" but C and S excluded? Not.

So ""haiku"" or ""vapid""?

I think ""haiku"" is more common? Or not, but it is a word.

To test vowels: I and U. Or consonants: H, K.

Similarly, ""vapid"" has V, P, I, D. V and P are less common.

But we want to test common letters? But we have few options.

Another possibility: ""balmy"" but L and Y excluded? Not.

""cabin"" but C and N excluded? Not.

""habit"" is invalid because of T.

How about ""manic"" but C and N excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""waist"" but S and T excluded? Not.

So I think ""haiku"" is a reasonable choice.

Alternatively, ""capri"" but C and R excluded? Not.

So I'll go with ""haiku"".

Therefore, next guess: ""haiku""

But note: the secret word has at least one A, and we are putting A in the second position which is correct.

Now, we are testing H, I, K, U in positions 1, 3, 4, 5.

If any of these are present and in the correct position, we get ✓, or misplaced, we get '-'.

This should give us good information.

But wait: we know from the first guess that A was in the wrong position at position 3. Now that we have placed A correctly at position 2, so in the first guess, A was at position 3 and was misplaced, meaning the secret word's A is not at position 3. Therefore, in ""haiku"", if the secret word has another A? But we are not placing any other A. But in position 3, we are placing I, so that's fine. Since we know position 3 cannot have A (because from the first feedback), so we should not put A there anyway.

So I think ""haiku"" is a good guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""haiku"".Based on the previous feedback:
- From ""crane"": C, R, N, E are not in the secret word, and A is present but not in position 3.
- From ""salty"": S, L, T, Y are not in the secret word, and A is confirmed in position 2.

The secret word has the pattern: _ A _ _ _, and excludes the letters C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y. The next guess should prioritize testing new common vowels and consonants from the remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z) to gain maximum information.

""Haiku"" is chosen as the next guess because:
- It fits the pattern (_ A _ _ _) and avoids excluded letters.
- It introduces four new untested letters: H, I, K, U.
- It tests common vowels (I and U) and consonants (H and K) that may reveal positions or presence in the secret word.
- Since A is already confirmed in position 2, the focus shifts to solving the other positions efficiently.

Also, we should avoid the letters that we now know are absent.\n\nLet\'s think of a word that:\n- Has 5 letters, all different to maximize information (if possible).\n- Contains \'A\' but not in the third position.\n- Avoids C, R, N, E.\n\nCommon vowels besides \'A\' and \'E\' (which is out) are \'I\', \'O\', \'U\'. But we also have consonants.\n\nWe can try to use other common letters: S, T, L, P, H, etc.\n\nOne common starting word is ""salet"", but note that we have to avoid R and E. So ""salet"" has E and R? Actually, ""salet"" has E and T? Let me check: S, A, L, E, T. But E is out, so we cannot use E.\n\nAnother common word is ""audio"" but that has 5 vowels and we know A is present, but we need more consonants.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""stamp"":\n- S, T, A, M, P\n- A is in the third position? But in our previous guess, A was in the third position and it was misplaced. So in the secret word, A is not in the third position. Therefore, we should put A in a different position.\n\nLet me try to put A in the second position? Or the first? Or the fourth? Or the fifth?\n\nWe don\'t know, so we can try a word that has A in a different position, say the second.\n\nFor example, ""laugh"": but note that we have to avoid R, and also G and H are common? But we don\'t know about them.\n\nBut we also want to test other common letters.\n\nAnother idea: since we know A is present, and we have only one known letter, we can try to use a word that has A and four new letters.\n\nLet me list some words without C, R, N, E and with A in a position other than 3.\n\nPossible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.\n\nLet me try to form a word with A in the second position: for example, ""palsy"": P, A, L, S, Y. But we don\'t know about P, L, S, Y.\n\nAlternatively, ""fault"": F, A, U, L, T. But we don\'t know about F, U, L, T.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N, E.\n\nSo, let\'s try to choose a word that has A and also includes other common letters that we haven\'t tested yet, such as S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\nI think ""staid"" is a good candidate? But let\'s check: S, T, A, I, D. \n- A is in the third position? We want to avoid the third position because in the secret word A is not in the third. But wait, in our first guess we had A in the third and it was misplaced, meaning the secret word has A but not in the third. So in the next guess, we should put A in a different position.\n\nTherefore, we should avoid putting A in the third position again.\n\nSo for ""staid"", A is in the third? That\'s the same as before. We don\'t want that.\n\nHow about ""aisle"": A, I, S, L, E -> but E is out! We cannot use E.\n\nAnother word: ""aloft"": A, L, O, F, T -> A is in the first position. This is good because we haven\'t tested A in the first position.\n\nBut we don\'t know about L, O, F, T.\n\nAlternatively, ""about"": A, B, O, U, T -> A in first. But we don\'t know about B, O, U, T.\n\nBut note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother common word: ""adieu"" but that has E? No, ""adieu"" is A, D, I, E, U -> E is out, so we cannot use.\n\nHow about ""audio"": A, U, D, I, O -> that\'s all vowels? But we know A is present, and we can test U, D, I, O.\n\nBut we might get less information because vowels are less frequent? However, we have to avoid consonants that we haven\'t tested? Actually, we haven\'t tested many consonants.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""piano"": P, I, A, N, O -> but N is out! We know N is absent. So we cannot use N.\n\nWe must avoid N.\n\nSo let me think of words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nHere\'s a list of possible words without C, R, N, E and with A not in the third position:\n\n- Position 1: A, then four other letters (not C, R, N, E). Examples: ""about"", ""above"" (but V and B? and O, U, T), ""adapt"" (but D, A, P, T; but A is in first and third? We don\'t want A in third? Actually, we can have A in multiple positions? But the word must be valid. However, we know the secret word has at least one A, but we don\'t know if it has more. But in ""adapt"", we have two A\'s? But we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s. Also, we are avoiding C, R, N, E, so ""adapt"" is A, D, A, P, T? Wait, that\'s two A\'s. But the word ""adapt"" has A in first and third. We are trying to test A in a new position, but we are also putting it in the third again? We want to avoid the third because we know the secret word\'s A is not in the third? Actually, we don\'t know if there is a second A. But we are only sure about one A. So it\'s okay to put A in the third again? But that might not be efficient because we already know that the A is not in the third. So if we put A in the third again and it shows as absent (x) or correct (✓)? Actually, if we put A in the third and it is the same A we already know, then it should be either misplaced again (if the secret word has only one A and it\'s not in third) or correct (if the secret word has two A\'s and one is in third). But we don\'t know. However, to maximize information, it\'s better to try A in a new position.\n\nSo I think we should avoid the third position for A in this guess.\n\nTherefore, let\'s look for words that have A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nAnother idea: ""salty"": S, A, L, T, Y -> A in second position. This avoids the third. And the letters S, L, T, Y are new.\n\nBut we don\'t know about S, L, T, Y.\n\nAlternatively, ""focal"" but has C and L? C is out, so we cannot use C.\n\nWe must avoid C.\n\nSo ""salty"" seems good: S, A, L, T, Y.\n\nBut we also have the option to test more common letters. The most common consonants in English are T, N, S, H, R, ... but we know N and R are out. So T and S are very common.\n\nTherefore, ""salty"" is a good candidate.\n\nAnother word: ""patio"": P, A, T, I, O -> A in second position. This also tests P, T, I, O.\n\nBut we don\'t know about P, T, I, O.\n\nI think both are good. Let me choose one.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""stamp"" but then A is in the third? We don\'t want that. So avoid.\n\nHow about ""tally"": T, A, L, L, Y -> but has double L? That might not be ideal because we get less information about distinct letters. So better to have all distinct letters.\n\n""Salty"" has distinct letters: S, A, L, T, Y.\n\n""Patio"" has distinct: P, A, T, I, O.\n\nI think ""patio"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (A and I, O) and two common consonants (P, T). But we already know A is present, so we are testing I, O, P, T.\n\nBut ""salty"" has S, A, L, T, Y. S and T are very common.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""salty"" because it has S and T which are high frequency.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N, E. ""salty"" does not contain any of these.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""salty"".\n\nBut wait, we have to consider that the secret word has an A that is not in the third position. In ""salty"", we are putting A in the second position. That\'s a new position.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""salty"".\n\nBut let me double-check: \n- First guess: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)\n- So we know A is present and not in position 3.\n\nNow, with ""salty"":\n- If the A in the second position is correct, we get a ✓ for A.\n- If not, we might get a \'-\' for A (if the secret word has A but not in second) or even an \'x\' (if there is only one A and it\'s not in second, but we know there is at least one A so it would be \'-\' if not in second? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one A and it is in a position that is not second, then we would get \'-\' for A because it is present but misplaced. But if we get an \'x\' for A, that would mean there is no A at all? But we know there is an A, so we should never get an \'x\' for A. Therefore, for A we can only get either ✓ (if it\'s in the second position) or \'-\' (if it\'s in the word but not in second). But note: we are putting A in the second position, and we know the secret word has an A that is not in the third. It could be in the second? We don\'t know.\n\nSo by putting A in the second, we are testing if the A is in the second position.\n\nAlso, we are testing S, L, T, Y.\n\nTherefore, I think ""salty"" is a good guess.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to put A in the first position? For example, ""about"". But we don\'t know about B, O, U, T.\n\nI think ""salty"" is fine.\n\nSo my next guess: ""salty""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").\n- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked as ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Avoid using C, R, N, E.\n- Include A, but not in the third position to test a new location.\n- Choose a word with common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, Y) to maximize information.\n- ""salty"" fits these criteria: A is in the second position, and it tests new letters (S, L, T, Y) while avoiding the excluded letters.\n\n<guess>salty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n1.

So S, L, T, Y are not in the secret word.\n- From ""crane"": C, R, E are absent (x) and N is also absent.

The next guess should prioritize testing new common vowels and consonants from the remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z) to gain maximum information.\n\n""Haiku"" is chosen as the next guess because:\n- It fits the pattern (_ A _ _ _) and avoids excluded letters.\n- It introduces four new untested letters: H, I, K, U.\n- It tests common vowels (I and U) and consonants (H and K) that may reveal positions or presence in the secret word.\n- Since A is already confirmed in position 2, the focus shifts to solving the other positions efficiently.\n\n<guess>haiku</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: haiku -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) I(x) K(x) U(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for three guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
2. ""salty"": S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)
3. ""haiku"": H(x), A(✓), I(x), K(x), U(x)

From the feedback:
- We know the second letter is A (from ""salty"" and ""haiku"").
- Excluded letters (those marked 'x' in all guesses): C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y, H, I, K, U. So the secret word does not contain these letters.
- The only known included letter is A, and it is in position 2.

The secret word pattern: _ A _ _ _

We must avoid using any of the excluded letters: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y, H, I, K, U.

Available letters are those not excluded: 
All letters minus the above. 
Remaining: A (but already placed), B, D, F, G, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. 
And possibly other vowels? O is available, and consonants.

We must form a word that has second letter A, and uses only the available letters for the other positions: 1, 3, 4, 5.

Also, note that from the first guess (""crane""), A was misplaced in position 3. Now that we know A is fixed in position 2, this means there is no other A in the word? Or at least, if there were another A, it might be in a different position? But in ""haiku"", we did not put A in position 3, so we don't have information about other positions. However, in the first guess, A was placed in position 3 and got a '-', meaning it is present but not in that position. Since we now know A is in position 2, that A in position 3 must be the same one? Meaning there is only one A? Because if there were two A's, then in the first guess, position 3 A could have been a different A? But in Wordle, the feedback indicates if a letter is correct or present regardless of duplication? Actually, Wordle handles duplicated letters: if there are two of the same letter, you might get multiple marks. But in this case, the first guess ""crane"" had one A in position 3, and we got a '-' meaning it is present but wrong position. Since we now found A in position 2, it implies that A exists exactly once? Not necessarily, but it's possible.

However, we can't assume only one A. We must be cautious.

But for efficiency, let's assume only one A until we have evidence otherwise.

Now, given the available letters: B, D, F, G, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a word: letter1 A letter3 letter4 letter5.

Possible words? We must think of words that fit.

Examples:
- ""gamba"" but has two A's? And B. But also M? ""gamba"" is G,A,M,B,A. But if we assume only one A, this might not be good. Also, letters: G, M, B are allowed? But let's see: G, A, M, B, A. We have two A's. But our pattern requires A in position 2, and then the other letters. If we use ""gamba"", letter4 is B and letter5 is A. But then the word must not have other A's? We don't know.

Perhaps not.

Another: ""balsa"" but S excluded? Not.

""papaw"" but P and W? ""papaw"" has two P's and two A's? P, A, P, A, W.

But A in position 2 and 4? That might be possible.

But S and L are excluded? In this word, letters are P, A, P, A, W. P and W are available? We haven't excluded P or W.

Other options: 
- ""drama"" but R excluded? R is excluded.

""gamma"" but M? and two M's and A's? G, A, M, M, A.

But letters: G, M. Available? Yes.

But this has two M's and two A's? Not ideal.

We need to choose a word that uses distinct letters to maximize information? But it's hard.

""baker"" but E and R excluded? Not.

""favor"" but F and V and O? and R excluded? R is excluded, so not.

""major"" but R excluded? Not.

""naval"" but L excluded? Not.

""pagan"" but G and N excluded? N excluded.

Not.

""wacky"" but C and Y excluded? Not.

""baddy"" but D? and Y excluded? Not.

""faddy"" same issue.

""gawky"" but W? and Y excluded? Not.

This seems difficult.

What about ""baggy""? B, A, G, G, Y -> but Y excluded? Not.

Another idea: ""daffy"" but D, A, F, F, Y -> Y excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""mambo"": M, A, M, B, O -> two M's? Letters: M, A, B, O. All available? M, B, O are available.

Is ""mambo"" a word? Yes.

Similarly, ""gumbo"": G, U, M, B, O. But U excluded? U is marked absent from ""haiku"". Yes, U is excluded.

So not ""gumbo"".

But ""mambo"" has U? No, ""mambo"": M, A, M, B, O.

But U is not in it? ""mambo"" has M, A, M, B, O. So vowels: A and O; consonants: M, M, B.

We are testing M, B, O? But we are putting multiple M's? So if M is in the word, we might get feedback accordingly.

But we don't know if M is in the word.

But we have to guess something.

Alternatively, ""vapor"": V, A, P, O, R -> but R excluded? Not.

""favor"": F, A, V, O, R -> R excluded? Not.

What about ""maple""? But L excluded? Not.

""oasis"" but S excluded? Not.

""azure"" but E and R? and U? Excluded? U is excluded? Let me check: ""azure"" is A, Z, U, R, E. U, R, E excluded? Not.

""brave"" but B, R, A, V, E -> R excluded? Not.

I think I need to use a dictionary search mentally.

Another common word: ""panda"" but P, A, N, D, A -> N excluded? Not.

""dandy"" D, A, N, D, Y -> N and Y excluded? Not.

""mammy"" M, A, M, M, Y -> Y excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""magma"": M, A, G, M, A -> two M's and two A's? G available.

But this has repeated letters.

To get different letters: ""badge"" but D, G, E? E excluded? Not.

""large""? R and E excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""cable"" but C excluded? Not.

This is tough.

What about ""gaffe""? G, A, F, F, E -> E excluded? Not.

""fauna"" F, A, U, N, A -> U and N excluded? Not.

""pasta"" P, A, S, T, A -> S and T excluded? Not.

""wafer"" W, A, F, E, R -> E and R excluded? Not.

""bacon"" B, A, C, O, N -> C and N excluded? Not.

Finally, ""booza"" is not a word.

Perhaps ""gamba"" is acceptable? But it has two A's.

We haven't tested B, G, M? and O?

Another word: ""daddy"" not allowed because of Y.

""pappy"" P, A, P, P, Y -> Y excluded and multiple P's? Not.

""happy"" H and Y excluded? Not.

We must avoid excluded letters.

How about ""macro""? M, A, C, R, O -> C and R excluded? Not.

""extra"" E, X, T, R, A -> E, T, R excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""woman"" W, O, M, A, N -> N excluded? Not.

""madam"" M, A, D, A, M -> this has two M's and two A's? D available.

But for position: first M, second A, third D, fourth A, fifth M.

But A is in second and fourth? So we are testing if fourth is A? But we don't know if there are two A's.

There might be two A's? For example, ""pampa"" or something.

But let's look for words with one A? If we are to find words with only one A? No, we can have multiple.

But for now, even words with multiple A's are possible.

""delta"" D, E, L, T, A -> E, L, T excluded? Not.

""vista"" V, I, S, T, A -> I, S, T excluded? Not.

""tough"" T excluded? Not.

""doubt"" D, O, U, B, T -> U and T excluded? Not.

I think we need to consider less common letters.

For example, ""bapus"" is not a word.

""vapid"" but we thought of it earlier? V, A, P, I, D -> but I is excluded now? From ""haiku"", I(x), so I is excluded. So not.

Similarly, ""vapid"" has I excluded.

Oh, so from ""haiku"", I, K, U, H are all excluded.

We cannot use those.

So available letters are: B, D, F, G, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

And A is fixed in second position.

Now, possible words:
- ""bobby"" but B? and Y excluded? Not.
- ""dandy"" not.
- ""food"" is four letters? Not five.
- ""good"" not five.
- ""booze"" B, O, O, Z, E -> E excluded? Not.
- ""jumbo"" J, U, M, B, O -> U excluded? Not.
- ""pizza"" P, I, Z, Z, A -> I excluded? And A is in fifth? But we need A in second. Pattern: _ A _ _ _ so A must be second.

So the word must have second letter A.

This is very restrictive.

Words that come to mind: ""gamba"", ""gamma"", ""mamma"", ""pampa"", ""bacca"" not a word, ""cabal"" C and L? Not.

""dacha"" D, A, C, H, A -> C and H excluded? Not.

""fabio"" F, A, B, I, O -> I excluded? Not.

""gawky"" W and Y? Not.

""jammy"" J, A, M, M, Y -> Y excluded? Not.

""karma"" K excluded? Not.

""langa"" L excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""manga"" M, A, N, G, A -> N excluded? Not.

""nappy"" N and Y? Not.

""paddy"" P, A, D, D, Y -> Y excluded? Not.

""quale"" Q, U, A, L, E -> U, L, E excluded? Not.

""radar"" R excluded? Not.

""samba"" S excluded? Not.

""tappa"" T excluded? Not.

""vanga"" V, A, N, G, A -> N excluded? Not.

"" wager"" W, A, G, E, R -> E and R excluded? Not.

So few options.

What about ""wowee""? Not standard.

I think ""abaci"" but A is not in second in ""abaci""? ""abaci"" is A,B,A,C,I -> first letter A, not second.

But we need second letter A.

Another: ""babul"" B, A, B, U, L -> U and L excluded? Not.

""gadjo"" G, A, D, J, O -> letters G, D, J, O. J is available? We haven't excluded J. But is it a word? Gadjo is a word for a non-Roman in Romani culture? Might be obscure.

Similarly, ""gadge"" E excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""maund""? M, A, U, N, D -> U and N excluded? Not.

"" paul "" P, A, U, L, . -> but three letters? Not.

"" racon "" R and C, not.

How about ""vamp"" is four letters.

""wamus"" W, A, M, U, S -> U and S excluded? Not.

I think we might be missing some common words.

Let's try ""pawky"" P, A, W, K, Y -> K and Y excluded? Not.

Another idea: ""dazes"" but S and E? Not.

Perhaps ""dabba"" D, A, B, B, A -> this is not English? But colloquial.

In standard English, what words are there?

""manor"" M, A, N, O, R -> N and R excluded? Not.

""major"" M, A, J, O, R -> R excluded? Not.

We need a word like ""bajra""? But not common.

Perhaps ""beige"" E and I? Excluded.

I think we need to consider that the secret word might have two A's? But then the positions.

For example, ""pampa"": P, A, M, P, A.

Second letter A, and fifth letter A.

But also P and M available.

But ""pampa"" is a word (meaning plains in South America).

Letters: P, A, M, P, A. So P and M are the letters.

Similarly, ""gamma"": G, A, M, M, A.

But in ""gamma"", letters G, M.

Both are valid and use available letters.

Another: ""drama"" but R excluded.

Or ""flamingo"" too long.

So perhaps ""pampa"" or ""gamma"".

Let's choose between them.

""Gamma"" has G and M.

""Pampa"" has P and M.

Both use M.

To test more consonants, perhaps ""pampa"" because we could test P.

Or ""gamma"" for G.

But both have duplicates? In ""pampa"", we have two P's and two A's.

Similarly in ""gamma"", two M's and two A's.

So if in the secret word, there is only one M or one P, we might not get accurate feedback? But the game handles it: if there is only one P, but we put two, then one might be marked correctly and the other absent? It's complicated.

But for now, since we have limited options, let's choose one.

Another word: ""bacca"" not a word, or ""sagas"" S excluded.

How about ""kappa""? K, A, P, P, A -> but K is excluded? From ""haiku"", K(x), so K is out.

Not.

""tappa"" T excluded.

So back to ""pampa"" or ""gamma"".

Or ""bamba""?

But ""bamba"" might not be common.

Perhaps ""d a o b b"" not a word.

I think ""pampa"" is the best available.

We can also consider ""mafia"" but F, I, A -> I is excluded? From ""haiku"", I(x), so not.

Similarly, ""facia"" F, A, C, I, A -> C and I excluded? Not.

So, I will guess ""pampa"".

Therefore, next guess is ""pampa"".

But note: the first letter P, the second A (correct), the third M, the fourth P, the fifth A.

Now, if there are two A's vs one, etc.

But let's hope it is valid.

Another option: ""vodka"" but O, D, K, A -> K excluded? Not.

""vodka"" has V, O, D, K, A. But second letter O, not A.

Not.

So ""pampa"" it is.

After reviewing the previous guesses and feedback:
1. **Guess 1: crane**  
   Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
   - A is in the secret word but not in position 3.
   - C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.

2. **Guess 2: salty**  
   Feedback: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)  
   - A is confirmed in position 2.
   - S, L, T, Y are not in the secret word.

3. **Guess 3: haiku**  
   Feedback: H(x) A(✓) I(x) K(x) U(x)  
   - A is again confirmed in position 2 (no change).
   - H, I, K, U are not in the secret word.

### Key deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A _ _ _` (A in position 2).
- **Excluded letters** (all marked 'x' in previous guesses): C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y, H, I, K, U.  
- **Available letters** (not tested or not excluded): B, D, F, G, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
- From the first guess, A was misplaced in position 3, suggesting A may not be in that position (though multiple A's are possible).
- Given the feedback, the word is likely uncommon due to the limited options.

### Approach for the next guess:
- Focus on the pattern `_ A _ _ _` and use only available letters.
- Prioritize common consonants and vowels from the available pool (e.g., B, D, F, G, M, O, P, V) to test new letters efficiently.
- Given the constraints, words with double letters may be unavoidable; ""pampa"" (meaning plains in South America) is a valid 5-letter word fitting:
  - Positions: P (position 1), A (position 2, fixed), M (position 3), P (position 4), A (position 5).
- This guess tests:
  - P in positions 1 and 4.
  - M in position 3.
  - A in position 5 (since position 2 is fixed; we haven't tested A elsewhere yet).
- If the secret word has only one A, position 5 A would be marked 'x' or '-' depending on location.

<guess>pampa</guess>",pampa,"We are given feedback for three guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
2. ""salty"": S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)
3. ""haiku"": H(x), A(✓), I(x), K(x), U(x)

From the feedback:
- We know the second letter is A (from ""salty"" and ""haiku"").
- Excluded letters (those marked 'x' in all guesses): C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y, H, I, K, U. So the secret word does not contain these letters.
- The only known included letter is A, and it is in position 2.

The secret word pattern: _ A _ _ _

We must avoid using any of the excluded letters: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y, H, I, K, U.

Available letters are those not excluded: 
All letters minus the above. 
Remaining: A (but already placed), B, D, F, G, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. 
And possibly other vowels? O is available, and consonants.

We must form a word that has second letter A, and uses only the available letters for the other positions: 1, 3, 4, 5.

Also, note that from the first guess (""crane""), A was misplaced in position 3. Now that we know A is fixed in position 2, this means there is no other A in the word? Or at least, if there were another A, it might be in a different position? But in ""haiku"", we did not put A in position 3, so we don't have information about other positions. However, in the first guess, A was placed in position 3 and got a '-', meaning it is present but not in that position. Since we now know A is in position 2, that A in position 3 must be the same one?

Another: ""babul"" B, A, B, U, L -> U and L excluded? Not.

""gadjo"" G, A, D, J, O -> letters G, D, J, O. J is available? We haven't excluded J. But is it a word? Gadjo is a word for a non-Roman in Romani culture? Might be obscure.

Similarly, ""gadge"" E excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""maund""? M, A, U, N, D -> U and N excluded? Not.

"" paul "" P, A, U, L, . -> but three letters? Not.

"" racon "" R and C, not.

How about ""vamp"" is four letters.

""wamus"" W, A, M, U, S -> U and S excluded? Not.

I think we might be missing some common words.

Let's try ""pawky"" P, A, W, K, Y -> K and Y excluded? Not.

Another idea: ""dazes"" but S and E? Not.

Perhaps ""dabba"" D, A, B, B, A -> this is not English? But colloquial.

In standard English, what words are there?

""manor"" M, A, N, O, R -> N and R excluded? Not.

""major"" M, A, J, O, R -> R excluded? Not.

We need a word like ""bajra""? But not common.

Perhaps ""beige"" E and I? Excluded.

I think we need to consider that the secret word might have two A's? But then the positions.

For example, ""pampa"": P, A, M, P, A.

Second letter A, and fifth letter A.

But also P and M available.

But ""pampa"" is a word (meaning plains in South America).

Letters: P, A, M, P, A. So P and M are the letters.

Similarly, ""gamma"": G, A, M, M, A.

But in ""gamma"", letters G, M.

Both are valid and use available letters.

Another: ""drama"" but R excluded.

Or ""flamingo"" too long.

So perhaps ""pampa"" or ""gamma"".

Let's choose between them.

""Gamma"" has G and M.

""Pampa"" has P and M.

Both use M.

To test more consonants, perhaps ""pampa"" because we could test P.

Or ""gamma"" for G.

But both have duplicates? In ""pampa"", we have two P's and two A's.

Similarly in ""gamma"", two M's and two A's.

So if in the secret word, there is only one M or one P, we might not get accurate feedback? But the game handles it: if there is only one P, but we put two, then one might be marked correctly and the other absent? It's complicated.

But for now, since we have limited options, let's choose one.

Another word: ""bacca"" not a word, or ""sagas"" S excluded.

How about ""kappa""? K, A, P, P, A -> but K is excluded? From ""haiku"", K(x), so K is out.

Not.

""tappa"" T excluded.

So back to ""pampa"" or ""gamma"".

Or ""bamba""?

But ""bamba"" might not be common.

Perhaps ""d a o b b"" not a word.

I think ""pampa"" is the best available.

We can also consider ""mafia"" but F, I, A -> I is excluded? From ""haiku"", I(x), so not.

Similarly, ""facia"" F, A, C, I, A -> C and I excluded? Not.

So, I will guess ""pampa"".

Therefore, next guess is ""pampa"".

But note: the first letter P, the second A (correct), the third M, the fourth P, the fifth A.

Now, if there are two A's vs one, etc.

But let's hope it is valid.

Another option: ""vodka"" but O, D, K, A -> K excluded? Not.

""vodka"" has V, O, D, K, A. But second letter O, not A.

Not.

So ""pampa"" it is.

<guess>pampa</guess>After reviewing the previous guesses and feedback:
1. **Guess 1: crane**  
   Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
   - A is in the secret word but not in position 3.
   - C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.

2. **Guess 2: salty**  
   Feedback: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)  
   - A is confirmed in position 2.
   - S, L, T, Y are not in the secret word.

3. **Guess 3: haiku**  
   Feedback: H(x) A(✓) I(x) K(x) U(x)  
   - A is again confirmed in position 2 (no change).
   - H, I, K, U are not in the secret word.

### Key deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A _ _ _` (A in position 2).
- **Excluded letters** (all marked 'x' in previous guesses): C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y, H, I, K, U.  
- **Available letters** (not tested or not excluded): B, D, F, G, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
- From the first guess, A was misplaced in position 3, suggesting A may not be in that position (though multiple A's are possible).
- Given the feedback, the word is likely uncommon due to the limited options.

### Approach for the next guess:
- Focus on the pattern `_ A _ _ _` and use only available letters.
- Prioritize common consonants and vowels from the available pool (e.g., B, D, F, G, M, O, P, V) to test new letters efficiently.
- Given the constraints, words with double letters may be unavoidable; ""pampa"" (meaning plains in South America) is a valid 5-letter word fitting:
  - Positions: P (position 1), A (position 2, fixed), M (position 3), P (position 4), A (position 5).
- This guess tests:
  - P in positions 1 and 4.
  - M in position 3.
  - A in position 5 (since position 2 is fixed; we haven't tested A elsewhere yet).
- If the secret word has only one A, position 5 A would be marked 'x' or '-' depending on location.",Guess 4: pampa -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) M(✓) P(x) A(✓),FAIL

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, from this we know:
- The letter 'A' is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since we placed it in the third position and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'A' and does not contain C, R, N, E.

For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, N, E (since they are absent).
- Includes the letter 'A' (since we know it's present) but in a different position (not position 3).
- We might also want to include other common letters to get more information.

Since we know 'A' is in the word, we can try to place it in a different position. Also, we should avoid the letters that we now know are absent.

Let's think of a word that:
- Has 5 letters, all different to maximize information (if possible).
- Contains 'A' but not in the third position.
- Avoids C, R, N, E.

Common vowels besides 'A' and 'E' (which is out) are 'I', 'O', 'U'. But we also have consonants.

We can try to use other common letters: S, T, L, P, H, etc.

One common starting word is ""salet"", but note that we have to avoid R and E. So ""salet"" has E and R? Actually, ""salet"" has E and T? Let me check: S, A, L, E, T. But E is out, so we cannot use E.

Another common word is ""audio"" but that has 5 vowels and we know A is present, but we need more consonants.

Alternatively, we can try ""stamp"":
- S, T, A, M, P
- A is in the third position? But in our previous guess, A was in the third position and it was misplaced. So in the secret word, A is not in the third position. Therefore, we should put A in a different position.

Let me try to put A in the second position? Or the first? Or the fourth? Or the fifth?

We don't know, so we can try a word that has A in a different position, say the second.

For example, ""laugh"": but note that we have to avoid R, and also G and H are common? But we don't know about them.

But we also want to test other common letters.

Another idea: since we know A is present, and we have only one known letter, we can try to use a word that has A and four new letters.

Let me list some words without C, R, N, E and with A in a position other than 3.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

Let me try to form a word with A in the second position: for example, ""palsy"": P, A, L, S, Y. But we don't know about P, L, S, Y.

Alternatively, ""fault"": F, A, U, L, T. But we don't know about F, U, L, T.

But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N, E.

So, let's try to choose a word that has A and also includes other common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as S, T, L, I, O, etc.

I think ""staid"" is a good candidate? But let's check: S, T, A, I, D. 
- A is in the third position? We want to avoid the third position because in the secret word A is not in the third. But wait, in our first guess we had A in the third and it was misplaced, meaning the secret word has A but not in the third. So in the next guess, we should put A in a different position.

Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the third position again.

So for ""staid"", A is in the third? That's the same as before. We don't want that.

How about ""aisle"": A, I, S, L, E -> but E is out! We cannot use E.

Another word: ""aloft"": A, L, O, F, T -> A is in the first position. This is good because we haven't tested A in the first position.

But we don't know about L, O, F, T.

Alternatively, ""about"": A, B, O, U, T -> A in first. But we don't know about B, O, U, T.

But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another common word: ""adieu"" but that has E? No, ""adieu"" is A, D, I, E, U -> E is out, so we cannot use.

How about ""audio"": A, U, D, I, O -> that's all vowels? But we know A is present, and we can test U, D, I, O.

But we might get less information because vowels are less frequent? However, we have to avoid consonants that we haven't tested? Actually, we haven't tested many consonants.

Alternatively, we can try ""piano"": P, I, A, N, O -> but N is out! We know N is absent. So we cannot use N.

We must avoid N.

So let me think of words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E.

Here's a list of possible words without C, R, N, E and with A not in the third position:

- Position 1: A, then four other letters (not C, R, N, E). Examples: ""about"", ""above"" (but V and B? and O, U, T), ""adapt"" (but D, A, P, T; but A is in first and third? We don't want A in third? Actually, we can have A in multiple positions? But the word must be valid. However, we know the secret word has at least one A, but we don't know if it has more. But in ""adapt"", we have two A's? But we don't know if the secret word has two A's. Also, we are avoiding C, R, N, E, so ""adapt"" is A, D, A, P, T? Wait, that's two A's. But the word ""adapt"" has A in first and third. We are trying to test A in a new position, but we are also putting it in the third again? We want to avoid the third because we know the secret word's A is not in the third? Actually, we don't know if there is a second A. But we are only sure about one A. So it's okay to put A in the third again? But that might not be efficient because we already know that the A is not in the third. So if we put A in the third again and it shows as absent (x) or correct (✓)? Actually, if we put A in the third and it is the same A we already know, then it should be either misplaced again (if the secret word has only one A and it's not in third) or correct (if the secret word has two A's and one is in third). But we don't know. However, to maximize information, it's better to try A in a new position.

So I think we should avoid the third position for A in this guess.

Therefore, let's look for words that have A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and avoid C, R, N, E.

Another idea: ""salty"": S, A, L, T, Y -> A in second position. This avoids the third. And the letters S, L, T, Y are new.

But we don't know about S, L, T, Y.

Alternatively, ""focal"" but has C and L? C is out, so we cannot use C.

We must avoid C.

So ""salty"" seems good: S, A, L, T, Y.

But we also have the option to test more common letters. The most common consonants in English are T, N, S, H, R, ... but we know N and R are out. So T and S are very common.

Therefore, ""salty"" is a good candidate.

Another word: ""patio"": P, A, T, I, O -> A in second position. This also tests P, T, I, O.

But we don't know about P, T, I, O.

I think both are good. Let me choose one.

Alternatively, we can use ""stamp"" but then A is in the third? We don't want that. So avoid.

How about ""tally"": T, A, L, L, Y -> but has double L? That might not be ideal because we get less information about distinct letters. So better to have all distinct letters.

""Salty"" has distinct letters: S, A, L, T, Y.

""Patio"" has distinct: P, A, T, I, O.

I think ""patio"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (A and I, O) and two common consonants (P, T). But we already know A is present, so we are testing I, O, P, T.

But ""salty"" has S, A, L, T, Y. S and T are very common.

I think I'll go with ""salty"" because it has S and T which are high frequency.

But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N, E. ""salty"" does not contain any of these.

So let's choose ""salty"".

But wait, we have to consider that the secret word has an A that is not in the third position. In ""salty"", we are putting A in the second position. That's a new position.

Therefore, I will guess ""salty"".

But let me double-check: 
- First guess: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
- So we know A is present and not in position 3.

Now, with ""salty"":
- If the A in the second position is correct, we get a ✓ for A.
- If not, we might get a '-' for A (if the secret word has A but not in second) or even an 'x' (if there is only one A and it's not in second, but we know there is at least one A so it would be '-' if not in second? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one A and it is in a position that is not second, then we would get '-' for A because it is present but misplaced. But if we get an 'x' for A, that would mean there is no A at all? But we know there is an A, so we should never get an 'x' for A. Therefore, for A we can only get either ✓ (if it's in the second position) or '-' (if it's in the word but not in second). But note: we are putting A in the second position, and we know the secret word has an A that is not in the third. It could be in the second? We don't know.

So by putting A in the second, we are testing if the A is in the second position.

Also, we are testing S, L, T, Y.

Therefore, I think ""salty"" is a good guess.

Alternatively, we could try to put A in the first position? For example, ""about"". But we don't know about B, O, U, T.

I think ""salty"" is fine.

So my next guess: ""salty""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked as ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, R, N, E.
- Include A, but not in the third position to test a new location.
- Choose a word with common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, Y) to maximize information.
- ""salty"" fits these criteria: A is in the second position, and it tests new letters (S, L, T, Y) while avoiding the excluded letters.

<guess>salty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"" : C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
2. ""salty"" : S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)

From the feedback, we know:
- The letter 'A' is in the secret word and in the correct position. From ""salty"", A is in the second position and got a ✓. So the second letter of the secret word is A.
- From ""salty"": S, L, T, Y are all absent (x). So S, L, T, Y are not in the secret word.
- From ""crane"": C, R, E are absent (x) and N is also absent. So we know the secret word does not contain C, R, E, N, and now also S, L, T, Y.

Therefore, the set of excluded letters is: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y.

And we know that the second letter is A.

So the secret word pattern is: _ A _ _ _

Now, what letters can be used? We need to avoid the excluded letters: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y.

Also, we have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, T, Y in our guesses. Note that A is confirmed and placed, so for the other positions, we need new letters.

The alphabet minus the excluded letters: 
Excluded: C, E, N, R, S, T, L, Y. That's 8 letters.
Remaining letters: A (but already placed), B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But A is already used and placed correctly, so for the other positions, we use letters from the remaining set: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Also, we know from the first guess that A was misplaced in position 3 (from ""crane""), but now we know the secret word has A in position 2. And since we got a ✓ for A in position 2 in ""salty"", that means the A in position 3 in ""crane"" was not correct and there might be only one A? But wait, it's possible that the word has two A's? However, in the feedback for ""crane"", we got a '-' for A in position 3, meaning it's present but not in position 3. But now we have an A in position 2 confirmed. So if the word has only one A, then that A is in position 2, so any other A would get an x? But in ""salty"", we placed A only in position 2, and other positions had other letters. But we didn't place A elsewhere.

So we don't know if there are more A's. But since the word must have an A and it is in position 2, the '-' for A in position 3 from ""crane"" could be because that A is the same one? But no, because if there is only one A, then when we put it in position 3 in ""crane"", it should be '-' meaning it exists elsewhere, and now we found it in position 2. So if we put A in position 3 again, it should be x? But we know it's not in position 3. So we can avoid having A in other positions? Or test for another A.

But for now, let's assume there might be only one A until proven otherwise.

Now, the secret word is _ A _ _ _

We need to find a word that fits: 
Second letter is A.
Does not contain: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y (and the other excluded letters).

Also, we haven't tested many letters, so we should choose a word with as many new common letters as possible from the remaining set.

Common letters from the remaining: vowels I and O, consonants B, D, F, G, H, M, P, etc.

Possible words: we need a word of the form ?A???.

Examples: 
- ""gaudy"" but Y is excluded? Y is in the excluded list. So not.
- ""happy"" but P? and Y excluded.
- ""daddy"" but D? and Y excluded and double D? Not great because we want distinct letters to maximize info? But not necessary.

But we need to avoid the excluded letters.

I think ""bacon"" but C and N are excluded? Not.

Another: ""fable"" but E is excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""habit"": H, A, B, I, T -> but T is excluded? T is in the excluded list. So no.

Excluded: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y.

So avoid T.

Possible words: ""manor"" but M, A, N, O, R -> but N and R excluded? R is excluded.

Not.

""papal"" but P, A, P, A, L -> L excluded? L and doubled P and A.

But L is excluded.

We need to find a word with second letter A and no C,R,E,N,S,L,T,Y.

Let me try: ""kabob"" but K? and B? but O? Also, it has two B's and two O's? not efficient.

Perhaps ""radio"" but R excluded? R is excluded.

""magic"" but C excluded.

This is tricky.

Another: ""haiku"": H, A, I, K, U -> letters: H, I, K, U are not excluded. And A is in second.

So ""haiku"": 
- H, A, I, K, U

All letters are allowed: H, A, I, K, U. A is in second.

Now, H, I, K, U are new letters.

This seems like a valid word.

Other options: 
- ""fairy"" but R and Y excluded? Not.
- ""giant"" but T excluded? Not.
- ""bakes"" but S excluded? Not.

""quake"" but E excluded? Not.

""vapid"": V, A, P, I, D -> V, P, I, D are new and not excluded.

""vapid"" is a word.

But ""haiku"" and ""vapid"" are both options.

Also, ""habit"" has T excluded? Not.

Another: ""daisy"" but S and Y excluded? Not.

We could try ""jacks"" but C and S excluded? Not.

So ""haiku"" or ""vapid""?

I think ""haiku"" is more common? Or not, but it is a word.

To test vowels: I and U. Or consonants: H, K.

Similarly, ""vapid"" has V, P, I, D. V and P are less common.

But we want to test common letters? But we have few options.

Another possibility: ""balmy"" but L and Y excluded? Not.

""cabin"" but C and N excluded? Not.

""habit"" is invalid because of T.

How about ""manic"" but C and N excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""waist"" but S and T excluded? Not.

So I think ""haiku"" is a reasonable choice.

Alternatively, ""capri"" but C and R excluded? Not.

So I'll go with ""haiku"".

Therefore, next guess: ""haiku""

But note: the secret word has at least one A, and we are putting A in the second position which is correct.

Now, we are testing H, I, K, U in positions 1, 3, 4, 5.

If any of these are present and in the correct position, we get ✓, or misplaced, we get '-'.

This should give us good information.

But wait: we know from the first guess that A was in the wrong position at position 3. Now that we have placed A correctly at position 2, so in the first guess, A was at position 3 and was misplaced, meaning the secret word's A is not at position 3. Therefore, in ""haiku"", if the secret word has another A? But we are not placing any other A. But in position 3, we are placing I, so that's fine. Since we know position 3 cannot have A (because from the first feedback), so we should not put A there anyway.

So I think ""haiku"" is a good guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""haiku"".Based on the previous feedback:
- From ""crane"": C, R, N, E are not in the secret word, and A is present but not in position 3.
- From ""salty"": S, L, T, Y are not in the secret word, and A is confirmed in position 2.

The secret word has the pattern: _ A _ _ _, and excludes the letters C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y. The next guess should prioritize testing new common vowels and consonants from the remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z) to gain maximum information.

""Haiku"" is chosen as the next guess because:
- It fits the pattern (_ A _ _ _) and avoids excluded letters.
- It introduces four new untested letters: H, I, K, U.
- It tests common vowels (I and U) and consonants (H and K) that may reveal positions or presence in the secret word.
- Since A is already confirmed in position 2, the focus shifts to solving the other positions efficiently.

3. ""haiku"": H(x), A(✓), I(x), K(x), U(x)

From the feedback:
- We know the second letter is A (from ""salty"" and ""haiku"").
- Excluded letters (those marked 'x' in all guesses): C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y, H, I, K, U. So the secret word does not contain these letters.
- The only known included letter is A, and it is in position 2.

The secret word pattern: _ A _ _ _

We must avoid using any of the excluded letters: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y, H, I, K, U.

Available letters are those not excluded: 
All letters minus the above. 
Remaining: A (but already placed), B, D, F, G, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. 
And possibly other vowels? O is available, and consonants.

We must form a word that has second letter A, and uses only the available letters for the other positions: 1, 3, 4, 5.

Also, note that from the first guess (""crane""), A was misplaced in position 3. Now that we know A is fixed in position 2, this means there is no other A in the word? Or at least, if there were another A, it might be in a different position? But in ""haiku"", we did not put A in position 3, so we don't have information about other positions. However, in the first guess, A was placed in position 3 and got a '-', meaning it is present but not in that position. Since we now know A is in position 2, that A in position 3 must be the same one? Meaning there is only one A? Because if there were two A's, then in the first guess, position 3 A could have been a different A? But in Wordle, the feedback indicates if a letter is correct or present regardless of duplication? Actually, Wordle handles duplicated letters: if there are two of the same letter, you might get multiple marks. But in this case, the first guess ""crane"" had one A in position 3, and we got a '-' meaning it is present but wrong position. Since we now found A in position 2, it implies that A exists exactly once? Not necessarily, but it's possible.

However, we can't assume only one A. We must be cautious.

But for efficiency, let's assume only one A until we have evidence otherwise.

Now, given the available letters: B, D, F, G, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a word: letter1 A letter3 letter4 letter5.

Possible words? We must think of words that fit.

Examples:
- ""gamba"" but has two A's? And B. But also M? ""gamba"" is G,A,M,B,A. But if we assume only one A, this might not be good. Also, letters: G, M, B are allowed? But let's see: G, A, M, B, A. We have two A's. But our pattern requires A in position 2, and then the other letters. If we use ""gamba"", letter4 is B and letter5 is A. But then the word must not have other A's? We don't know.

Perhaps not.

Another: ""balsa"" but S excluded? Not.

""papaw"" but P and W? ""papaw"" has two P's and two A's? P, A, P, A, W.

But A in position 2 and 4? That might be possible.

But S and L are excluded? In this word, letters are P, A, P, A, W. P and W are available? We haven't excluded P or W.

Other options: 
- ""drama"" but R excluded? R is excluded.

""gamma"" but M? and two M's and A's? G, A, M, M, A.

But letters: G, M. Available? Yes.

But this has two M's and two A's? Not ideal.

We need to choose a word that uses distinct letters to maximize information? But it's hard.

""baker"" but E and R excluded? Not.

""favor"" but F and V and O? and R excluded? R is excluded, so not.

""major"" but R excluded? Not.

""naval"" but L excluded? Not.

""pagan"" but G and N excluded? N excluded.

Not.

""wacky"" but C and Y excluded? Not.

""baddy"" but D? and Y excluded? Not.

""faddy"" same issue.

""gawky"" but W? and Y excluded? Not.

This seems difficult.

What about ""baggy""? B, A, G, G, Y -> but Y excluded? Not.

Another idea: ""daffy"" but D, A, F, F, Y -> Y excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""mambo"": M, A, M, B, O -> two M's? Letters: M, A, B, O. All available? M, B, O are available.

Is ""mambo"" a word? Yes.

Similarly, ""gumbo"": G, U, M, B, O. But U excluded? U is marked absent from ""haiku"". Yes, U is excluded.

So not ""gumbo"".

But ""mambo"" has U? No, ""mambo"": M, A, M, B, O.

But U is not in it? ""mambo"" has M, A, M, B, O. So vowels: A and O; consonants: M, M, B.

We are testing M, B, O? But we are putting multiple M's? So if M is in the word, we might get feedback accordingly.

But we don't know if M is in the word.

But we have to guess something.

Alternatively, ""vapor"": V, A, P, O, R -> but R excluded? Not.

""favor"": F, A, V, O, R -> R excluded? Not.

What about ""maple""? But L excluded? Not.

""oasis"" but S excluded? Not.

""azure"" but E and R? and U? Excluded? U is excluded? Let me check: ""azure"" is A, Z, U, R, E. U, R, E excluded? Not.

""brave"" but B, R, A, V, E -> R excluded? Not.

I think I need to use a dictionary search mentally.

Another common word: ""panda"" but P, A, N, D, A -> N excluded? Not.

""dandy"" D, A, N, D, Y -> N and Y excluded? Not.

""mammy"" M, A, M, M, Y -> Y excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""magma"": M, A, G, M, A -> two M's and two A's? G available.

But this has repeated letters.

To get different letters: ""badge"" but D, G, E? E excluded? Not.

""large""? R and E excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""cable"" but C excluded? Not.

This is tough.

What about ""gaffe""? G, A, F, F, E -> E excluded? Not.

""fauna"" F, A, U, N, A -> U and N excluded? Not.

""pasta"" P, A, S, T, A -> S and T excluded? Not.

""wafer"" W, A, F, E, R -> E and R excluded? Not.

""bacon"" B, A, C, O, N -> C and N excluded? Not.

Finally, ""booza"" is not a word.

Perhaps ""gamba"" is acceptable? But it has two A's.

We haven't tested B, G, M? and O?

Another word: ""daddy"" not allowed because of Y.

""pappy"" P, A, P, P, Y -> Y excluded and multiple P's? Not.

""happy"" H and Y excluded? Not.

We must avoid excluded letters.

How about ""macro""? M, A, C, R, O -> C and R excluded? Not.

""extra"" E, X, T, R, A -> E, T, R excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""woman"" W, O, M, A, N -> N excluded? Not.

""madam"" M, A, D, A, M -> this has two M's and two A's? D available.

But for position: first M, second A, third D, fourth A, fifth M.

But A is in second and fourth? So we are testing if fourth is A? But we don't know if there are two A's.

There might be two A's? For example, ""pampa"" or something.

But let's look for words with one A? If we are to find words with only one A? No, we can have multiple.

But for now, even words with multiple A's are possible.

""delta"" D, E, L, T, A -> E, L, T excluded? Not.

""vista"" V, I, S, T, A -> I, S, T excluded? Not.

""tough"" T excluded? Not.

""doubt"" D, O, U, B, T -> U and T excluded? Not.

I think we need to consider less common letters.

For example, ""bapus"" is not a word.

""vapid"" but we thought of it earlier? V, A, P, I, D -> but I is excluded now? From ""haiku"", I(x), so I is excluded. So not.

Similarly, ""vapid"" has I excluded.

Oh, so from ""haiku"", I, K, U, H are all excluded.

We cannot use those.

So available letters are: B, D, F, G, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

And A is fixed in second position.

Now, possible words:
- ""bobby"" but B? and Y excluded? Not.
- ""dandy"" not.
- ""food"" is four letters? Not five.
- ""good"" not five.
- ""booze"" B, O, O, Z, E -> E excluded? Not.
- ""jumbo"" J, U, M, B, O -> U excluded? Not.
- ""pizza"" P, I, Z, Z, A -> I excluded? And A is in fifth? But we need A in second. Pattern: _ A _ _ _ so A must be second.

So the word must have second letter A.

This is very restrictive.

Words that come to mind: ""gamba"", ""gamma"", ""mamma"", ""pampa"", ""bacca"" not a word, ""cabal"" C and L? Not.

""dacha"" D, A, C, H, A -> C and H excluded? Not.

""fabio"" F, A, B, I, O -> I excluded? Not.

""gawky"" W and Y? Not.

""jammy"" J, A, M, M, Y -> Y excluded? Not.

""karma"" K excluded? Not.

""langa"" L excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""manga"" M, A, N, G, A -> N excluded? Not.

""nappy"" N and Y? Not.

""paddy"" P, A, D, D, Y -> Y excluded? Not.

""quale"" Q, U, A, L, E -> U, L, E excluded? Not.

""radar"" R excluded? Not.

""samba"" S excluded? Not.

""tappa"" T excluded? Not.

""vanga"" V, A, N, G, A -> N excluded? Not.

"" wager"" W, A, G, E, R -> E and R excluded? Not.

So few options.

What about ""wowee""? Not standard.

I think ""abaci"" but A is not in second in ""abaci""? ""abaci"" is A,B,A,C,I -> first letter A, not second.

But we need second letter A.

Another: ""babul"" B, A, B, U, L -> U and L excluded? Not.

""gadjo"" G, A, D, J, O -> letters G, D, J, O. J is available? We haven't excluded J. But is it a word? Gadjo is a word for a non-Roman in Romani culture? Might be obscure.

Similarly, ""gadge"" E excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""maund""? M, A, U, N, D -> U and N excluded? Not.

"" paul "" P, A, U, L, . -> but three letters? Not.

"" racon "" R and C, not.

How about ""vamp"" is four letters.

""wamus"" W, A, M, U, S -> U and S excluded? Not.

I think we might be missing some common words.

Let's try ""pawky"" P, A, W, K, Y -> K and Y excluded? Not.

Another idea: ""dazes"" but S and E? Not.

Perhaps ""dabba"" D, A, B, B, A -> this is not English? But colloquial.

In standard English, what words are there?

""manor"" M, A, N, O, R -> N and R excluded? Not.

""major"" M, A, J, O, R -> R excluded? Not.

We need a word like ""bajra""? But not common.

Perhaps ""beige"" E and I? Excluded.

I think we need to consider that the secret word might have two A's? But then the positions.

For example, ""pampa"": P, A, M, P, A.

Second letter A, and fifth letter A.

But also P and M available.

But ""pampa"" is a word (meaning plains in South America).

Letters: P, A, M, P, A. So P and M are the letters.

Similarly, ""gamma"": G, A, M, M, A.

But in ""gamma"", letters G, M.

Both are valid and use available letters.

Another: ""drama"" but R excluded.

Or ""flamingo"" too long.

So perhaps ""pampa"" or ""gamma"".

Let's choose between them.

""Gamma"" has G and M.

""Pampa"" has P and M.

Both use M.

To test more consonants, perhaps ""pampa"" because we could test P.

Or ""gamma"" for G.

But both have duplicates? In ""pampa"", we have two P's and two A's.

Similarly in ""gamma"", two M's and two A's.

So if in the secret word, there is only one M or one P, we might not get accurate feedback? But the game handles it: if there is only one P, but we put two, then one might be marked correctly and the other absent? It's complicated.

But for now, since we have limited options, let's choose one.

Another word: ""bacca"" not a word, or ""sagas"" S excluded.

How about ""kappa""? K, A, P, P, A -> but K is excluded? From ""haiku"", K(x), so K is out.

Not.

""tappa"" T excluded.

So back to ""pampa"" or ""gamma"".

Or ""bamba""?

But ""bamba"" might not be common.

Perhaps ""d a o b b"" not a word.

I think ""pampa"" is the best available.

We can also consider ""mafia"" but F, I, A -> I is excluded? From ""haiku"", I(x), so not.

Similarly, ""facia"" F, A, C, I, A -> C and I excluded? Not.

So, I will guess ""pampa"".

Therefore, next guess is ""pampa"".

But note: the first letter P, the second A (correct), the third M, the fourth P, the fifth A.

Now, if there are two A's vs one, etc.

But let's hope it is valid.

Another option: ""vodka"" but O, D, K, A -> K excluded? Not.

""vodka"" has V, O, D, K, A. But second letter O, not A.

Not.

So ""pampa"" it is.

<guess>pampa</guess>After reviewing the previous guesses and feedback:
1. **Guess 1: crane**  
   Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
   - A is in the secret word but not in position 3.
   - C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.

2. **Guess 2: salty**  
   Feedback: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)  
   - A is confirmed in position 2.
   - S, L, T, Y are not in the secret word.

3. **Guess 3: haiku**  
   Feedback: H(x) A(✓) I(x) K(x) U(x)  
   - A is again confirmed in position 2 (no change).
   - H, I, K, U are not in the secret word.

### Key deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A _ _ _` (A in position 2).
- **Excluded letters** (all marked 'x' in previous guesses): C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y, H, I, K, U.  
- **Available letters** (not tested or not excluded): B, D, F, G, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
- From the first guess, A was misplaced in position 3, suggesting A may not be in that position (though multiple A's are possible).
- Given the feedback, the word is likely uncommon due to the limited options.

### Approach for the next guess:
- Focus on the pattern `_ A _ _ _` and use only available letters.
- Prioritize common consonants and vowels from the available pool (e.g., B, D, F, G, M, O, P, V) to test new letters efficiently.
- Given the constraints, words with double letters may be unavoidable; ""pampa"" (meaning plains in South America) is a valid 5-letter word fitting:
  - Positions: P (position 1), A (position 2, fixed), M (position 3), P (position 4), A (position 5).
- This guess tests:
  - P in positions 1 and 4.
  - M in position 3.
  - A in position 5 (since position 2 is fixed; we haven't tested A elsewhere yet).
- If the secret word has only one A, position 5 A would be marked 'x' or '-' depending on location.

Also, we should avoid the letters that we now know are absent.\n\nLet\'s think of a word that:\n- Has 5 letters, all different to maximize information (if possible).\n- Contains \'A\' but not in the third position.\n- Avoids C, R, N, E.\n\nCommon vowels besides \'A\' and \'E\' (which is out) are \'I\', \'O\', \'U\'. But we also have consonants.\n\nWe can try to use other common letters: S, T, L, P, H, etc.\n\nOne common starting word is ""salet"", but note that we have to avoid R and E. So ""salet"" has E and R? Actually, ""salet"" has E and T? Let me check: S, A, L, E, T. But E is out, so we cannot use E.\n\nAnother common word is ""audio"" but that has 5 vowels and we know A is present, but we need more consonants.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""stamp"":\n- S, T, A, M, P\n- A is in the third position? But in our previous guess, A was in the third position and it was misplaced. So in the secret word, A is not in the third position. Therefore, we should put A in a different position.\n\nLet me try to put A in the second position? Or the first? Or the fourth? Or the fifth?\n\nWe don\'t know, so we can try a word that has A in a different position, say the second.\n\nFor example, ""laugh"": but note that we have to avoid R, and also G and H are common? But we don\'t know about them.\n\nBut we also want to test other common letters.\n\nAnother idea: since we know A is present, and we have only one known letter, we can try to use a word that has A and four new letters.\n\nLet me list some words without C, R, N, E and with A in a position other than 3.\n\nPossible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.\n\nLet me try to form a word with A in the second position: for example, ""palsy"": P, A, L, S, Y. But we don\'t know about P, L, S, Y.\n\nAlternatively, ""fault"": F, A, U, L, T. But we don\'t know about F, U, L, T.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N, E.\n\nSo, let\'s try to choose a word that has A and also includes other common letters that we haven\'t tested yet, such as S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\nI think ""staid"" is a good candidate? But let\'s check: S, T, A, I, D. \n- A is in the third position? We want to avoid the third position because in the secret word A is not in the third. But wait, in our first guess we had A in the third and it was misplaced, meaning the secret word has A but not in the third. So in the next guess, we should put A in a different position.\n\nTherefore, we should avoid putting A in the third position again.\n\nSo for ""staid"", A is in the third? That\'s the same as before. We don\'t want that.\n\nHow about ""aisle"": A, I, S, L, E -> but E is out! We cannot use E.\n\nAnother word: ""aloft"": A, L, O, F, T -> A is in the first position. This is good because we haven\'t tested A in the first position.\n\nBut we don\'t know about L, O, F, T.\n\nAlternatively, ""about"": A, B, O, U, T -> A in first. But we don\'t know about B, O, U, T.\n\nBut note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother common word: ""adieu"" but that has E? No, ""adieu"" is A, D, I, E, U -> E is out, so we cannot use.\n\nHow about ""audio"": A, U, D, I, O -> that\'s all vowels? But we know A is present, and we can test U, D, I, O.\n\nBut we might get less information because vowels are less frequent? However, we have to avoid consonants that we haven\'t tested? Actually, we haven\'t tested many consonants.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""piano"": P, I, A, N, O -> but N is out! We know N is absent. So we cannot use N.\n\nWe must avoid N.\n\nSo let me think of words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nHere\'s a list of possible words without C, R, N, E and with A not in the third position:\n\n- Position 1: A, then four other letters (not C, R, N, E). Examples: ""about"", ""above"" (but V and B? and O, U, T), ""adapt"" (but D, A, P, T; but A is in first and third? We don\'t want A in third? Actually, we can have A in multiple positions? But the word must be valid. However, we know the secret word has at least one A, but we don\'t know if it has more. But in ""adapt"", we have two A\'s? But we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s. Also, we are avoiding C, R, N, E, so ""adapt"" is A, D, A, P, T? Wait, that\'s two A\'s. But the word ""adapt"" has A in first and third. We are trying to test A in a new position, but we are also putting it in the third again? We want to avoid the third because we know the secret word\'s A is not in the third? Actually, we don\'t know if there is a second A. But we are only sure about one A. So it\'s okay to put A in the third again? But that might not be efficient because we already know that the A is not in the third. So if we put A in the third again and it shows as absent (x) or correct (✓)? Actually, if we put A in the third and it is the same A we already know, then it should be either misplaced again (if the secret word has only one A and it\'s not in third) or correct (if the secret word has two A\'s and one is in third). But we don\'t know. However, to maximize information, it\'s better to try A in a new position.\n\nSo I think we should avoid the third position for A in this guess.\n\nTherefore, let\'s look for words that have A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nAnother idea: ""salty"": S, A, L, T, Y -> A in second position. This avoids the third. And the letters S, L, T, Y are new.\n\nBut we don\'t know about S, L, T, Y.\n\nAlternatively, ""focal"" but has C and L? C is out, so we cannot use C.\n\nWe must avoid C.\n\nSo ""salty"" seems good: S, A, L, T, Y.\n\nBut we also have the option to test more common letters. The most common consonants in English are T, N, S, H, R, ... but we know N and R are out. So T and S are very common.\n\nTherefore, ""salty"" is a good candidate.\n\nAnother word: ""patio"": P, A, T, I, O -> A in second position. This also tests P, T, I, O.\n\nBut we don\'t know about P, T, I, O.\n\nI think both are good. Let me choose one.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""stamp"" but then A is in the third? We don\'t want that. So avoid.\n\nHow about ""tally"": T, A, L, L, Y -> but has double L? That might not be ideal because we get less information about distinct letters. So better to have all distinct letters.\n\n""Salty"" has distinct letters: S, A, L, T, Y.\n\n""Patio"" has distinct: P, A, T, I, O.\n\nI think ""patio"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (A and I, O) and two common consonants (P, T). But we already know A is present, so we are testing I, O, P, T.\n\nBut ""salty"" has S, A, L, T, Y. S and T are very common.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""salty"" because it has S and T which are high frequency.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N, E. ""salty"" does not contain any of these.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""salty"".\n\nBut wait, we have to consider that the secret word has an A that is not in the third position. In ""salty"", we are putting A in the second position. That\'s a new position.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""salty"".\n\nBut let me double-check: \n- First guess: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)\n- So we know A is present and not in position 3.\n\nNow, with ""salty"":\n- If the A in the second position is correct, we get a ✓ for A.\n- If not, we might get a \'-\' for A (if the secret word has A but not in second) or even an \'x\' (if there is only one A and it\'s not in second, but we know there is at least one A so it would be \'-\' if not in second? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one A and it is in a position that is not second, then we would get \'-\' for A because it is present but misplaced. But if we get an \'x\' for A, that would mean there is no A at all? But we know there is an A, so we should never get an \'x\' for A. Therefore, for A we can only get either ✓ (if it\'s in the second position) or \'-\' (if it\'s in the word but not in second). But note: we are putting A in the second position, and we know the secret word has an A that is not in the third. It could be in the second? We don\'t know.\n\nSo by putting A in the second, we are testing if the A is in the second position.\n\nAlso, we are testing S, L, T, Y.\n\nTherefore, I think ""salty"" is a good guess.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to put A in the first position? For example, ""about"". But we don\'t know about B, O, U, T.\n\nI think ""salty"" is fine.\n\nSo my next guess: ""salty""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").\n- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked as ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Avoid using C, R, N, E.\n- Include A, but not in the third position to test a new location.\n- Choose a word with common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, Y) to maximize information.\n- ""salty"" fits these criteria: A is in the second position, and it tests new letters (S, L, T, Y) while avoiding the excluded letters.\n\n<guess>salty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n1. ""crane"" : C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)\n2. ""salty"" : S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)\n\nFrom the feedback, we know:\n- The letter \'A\' is in the secret word and in the correct position. From ""salty"", A is in the second position and got a ✓. So the second letter of the secret word is A.\n- From ""salty"": S, L, T, Y are all absent (x). So S, L, T, Y are not in the secret word.\n- From ""crane"": C, R, E are absent (x) and N is also absent. So we know the secret word does not contain C, R, E, N, and now also S, L, T, Y.\n\nTherefore, the set of excluded letters is: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y.\n\nAnd we know that the second letter is A.\n\nSo the secret word pattern is: _ A _ _ _\n\nNow, what letters can be used? We need to avoid the excluded letters: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y.\n\nAlso, we have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, T, Y in our guesses. Note that A is confirmed and placed, so for the other positions, we need new letters.\n\nThe alphabet minus the excluded letters: \nExcluded: C, E, N, R, S, T, L, Y. That\'s 8 letters.\nRemaining letters: A (but already placed), B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nBut A is already used and placed correctly, so for the other positions, we use letters from the remaining set: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nAlso, we know from the first guess that A was misplaced in position 3 (from ""crane""), but now we know the secret word has A in position 2. And since we got a ✓ for A in position 2 in ""salty"", that means the A in position 3 in ""crane"" was not correct and there might be only one A? But wait, it\'s possible that the word has two A\'s? However, in the feedback for ""crane"", we got a \'-\' for A in position 3, meaning it\'s present but not in position 3. But now we have an A in position 2 confirmed. So if the word has only one A, then that A is in position 2, so any other A would get an x? But in ""salty"", we placed A only in position 2, and other positions had other letters. But we didn\'t place A elsewhere.\n\nSo we don\'t know if there are more A\'s. But since the word must have an A and it is in position 2, the \'-\' for A in position 3 from ""crane"" could be because that A is the same one? But no, because if there is only one A, then when we put it in position 3 in ""crane"", it should be \'-\' meaning it exists elsewhere, and now we found it in position 2. So if we put A in position 3 again, it should be x? But we know it\'s not in position 3. So we can avoid having A in other positions? Or test for another A.\n\nBut for now, let\'s assume there might be only one A until proven otherwise.\n\nNow, the secret word is _ A _ _ _\n\nWe need to find a word that fits: \nSecond letter is A.\nDoes not contain: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y (and the other excluded letters).\n\nAlso, we haven\'t tested many letters, so we should choose a word with as many new common letters as possible from the remaining set.\n\nCommon letters from the remaining: vowels I and O, consonants B, D, F, G, H, M, P, etc.\n\nPossible words: we need a word of the form ?A???.\n\nExamples: \n- ""gaudy"" but Y is excluded? Y is in the excluded list. So not.\n- ""happy"" but P? and Y excluded.\n- ""daddy"" but D? and Y excluded and double D? Not great because we want distinct letters to maximize info? But not necessary.\n\nBut we need to avoid the excluded letters.\n\nI think ""bacon"" but C and N are excluded? Not.\n\nAnother: ""fable"" but E is excluded? Not.\n\nPerhaps ""habit"": H, A, B, I, T -> but T is excluded? T is in the excluded list. So no.\n\nExcluded: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y.\n\nSo avoid T.\n\nPossible words: ""manor"" but M, A, N, O, R -> but N and R excluded? R is excluded.\n\nNot.\n\n""papal"" but P, A, P, A, L -> L excluded? L and doubled P and A.\n\nBut L is excluded.\n\nWe need to find a word with second letter A and no C,R,E,N,S,L,T,Y.\n\nLet me try: ""kabob"" but K? and B? but O? Also, it has two B\'s and two O\'s? not efficient.\n\nPerhaps ""radio"" but R excluded? R is excluded.\n\n""magic"" but C excluded.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nAnother: ""haiku"": H, A, I, K, U -> letters: H, I, K, U are not excluded. And A is in second.\n\nSo ""haiku"": \n- H, A, I, K, U\n\nAll letters are allowed: H, A, I, K, U. A is in second.\n\nNow, H, I, K, U are new letters.\n\nThis seems like a valid word.\n\nOther options: \n- ""fairy"" but R and Y excluded? Not.\n- ""giant"" but T excluded? Not.\n- ""bakes"" but S excluded? Not.\n\n""quake"" but E excluded? Not.\n\n""vapid"": V, A, P, I, D -> V, P, I, D are new and not excluded.\n\n""vapid"" is a word.\n\nBut ""haiku"" and ""vapid"" are both options.\n\nAlso, ""habit"" has T excluded? Not.\n\nAnother: ""daisy"" but S and Y excluded? Not.\n\nWe could try ""jacks"" but C and S excluded? Not.\n\nSo ""haiku"" or ""vapid""?\n\nI think ""haiku"" is more common? Or not, but it is a word.\n\nTo test vowels: I and U. Or consonants: H, K.\n\nSimilarly, ""vapid"" has V, P, I, D. V and P are less common.\n\nBut we want to test common letters? But we have few options.\n\nAnother possibility: ""balmy"" but L and Y excluded? Not.\n\n""cabin"" but C and N excluded? Not.\n\n""habit"" is invalid because of T.\n\nHow about ""manic"" but C and N excluded? Not.\n\nPerhaps ""waist"" but S and T excluded? Not.\n\nSo I think ""haiku"" is a reasonable choice.\n\nAlternatively, ""capri"" but C and R excluded? Not.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""haiku"".\n\nTherefore, next guess: ""haiku""\n\nBut note: the secret word has at least one A, and we are putting A in the second position which is correct.\n\nNow, we are testing H, I, K, U in positions 1, 3, 4, 5.\n\nIf any of these are present and in the correct position, we get ✓, or misplaced, we get \'-\'.\n\nThis should give us good information.\n\nBut wait: we know from the first guess that A was in the wrong position at position 3. Now that we have placed A correctly at position 2, so in the first guess, A was at position 3 and was misplaced, meaning the secret word\'s A is not at position 3. Therefore, in ""haiku"", if the secret word has another A? But we are not placing any other A. But in position 3, we are placing I, so that\'s fine. Since we know position 3 cannot have A (because from the first feedback), so we should not put A there anyway.\n\nSo I think ""haiku"" is a good guess.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""haiku"".Based on the previous feedback:\n- From ""crane"": C, R, N, E are not in the secret word, and A is present but not in position 3.\n- From ""salty"": S, L, T, Y are not in the secret word, and A is confirmed in position 2.\n\nThe secret word has the pattern: _ A _ _ _, and excludes the letters C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y. The next guess should prioritize testing new common vowels and consonants from the remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z) to gain maximum information.\n\n""Haiku"" is chosen as the next guess because:\n- It fits the pattern (_ A _ _ _) and avoids excluded letters.\n- It introduces four new untested letters: H, I, K, U.\n- It tests common vowels (I and U) and consonants (H and K) that may reveal positions or presence in the secret word.\n- Since A is already confirmed in position 2, the focus shifts to solving the other positions efficiently.\n\n<guess>haiku</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: haiku -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) I(x) K(x) U(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for three guesses:\n1.

So the secret word does not contain these letters.\n- The only known included letter is A, and it is in position 2.\n\nThe secret word pattern: _ A _ _ _\n\nWe must avoid using any of the excluded letters: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y, H, I, K, U.\n\nAvailable letters are those not excluded: \nAll letters minus the above. \nRemaining: A (but already placed), B, D, F, G, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. \nAnd possibly other vowels? O is available, and consonants.\n\nWe must form a word that has second letter A, and uses only the available letters for the other positions: 1, 3, 4, 5.\n\nAlso, note that from the first guess (""crane""), A was misplaced in position 3. Now that we know A is fixed in position 2, this means there is no other A in the word? Or at least, if there were another A, it might be in a different position? But in ""haiku"", we did not put A in position 3, so we don\'t have information about other positions. However, in the first guess, A was placed in position 3 and got a \'-\', meaning it is present but not in that position. Since we now know A is in position 2, that A in position 3 must be the same one? Meaning there is only one A? Because if there were two A\'s, then in the first guess, position 3 A could have been a different A? But in Wordle, the feedback indicates if a letter is correct or present regardless of duplication? Actually, Wordle handles duplicated letters: if there are two of the same letter, you might get multiple marks. But in this case, the first guess ""crane"" had one A in position 3, and we got a \'-\' meaning it is present but wrong position. Since we now found A in position 2, it implies that A exists exactly once? Not necessarily, but it\'s possible.\n\nHowever, we can\'t assume only one A. We must be cautious.\n\nBut for efficiency, let\'s assume only one A until we have evidence otherwise.\n\nNow, given the available letters: B, D, F, G, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.\n\nWe need a word: letter1 A letter3 letter4 letter5.\n\nPossible words? We must think of words that fit.\n\nExamples:\n- ""gamba"" but has two A\'s? And B. But also M? ""gamba"" is G,A,M,B,A. But if we assume only one A, this might not be good. Also, letters: G, M, B are allowed? But let\'s see: G, A, M, B, A. We have two A\'s. But our pattern requires A in position 2, and then the other letters. If we use ""gamba"", letter4 is B and letter5 is A. But then the word must not have other A\'s? We don\'t know.\n\nPerhaps not.\n\nAnother: ""balsa"" but S excluded? Not.\n\n""papaw"" but P and W? ""papaw"" has two P\'s and two A\'s? P, A, P, A, W.\n\nBut A in position 2 and 4? That might be possible.\n\nBut S and L are excluded? In this word, letters are P, A, P, A, W. P and W are available? We haven\'t excluded P or W.\n\nOther options: \n- ""drama"" but R excluded? R is excluded.\n\n""gamma"" but M? and two M\'s and A\'s? G, A, M, M, A.\n\nBut letters: G, M. Available? Yes.\n\nBut this has two M\'s and two A\'s? Not ideal.\n\nWe need to choose a word that uses distinct letters to maximize information? But it\'s hard.\n\n""baker"" but E and R excluded?

U is marked absent from ""haiku"". Yes, U is excluded.\n\nSo not ""gumbo"".\n\nBut ""mambo"" has U? No, ""mambo"": M, A, M, B, O.\n\nBut U is not in it? ""mambo"" has M, A, M, B, O. So vowels: A and O; consonants: M, M, B.\n\nWe are testing M, B, O? But we are putting multiple M\'s? So if M is in the word, we might get feedback accordingly.\n\nBut we don\'t know if M is in the word.\n\nBut we have to guess something.\n\nAlternatively, ""vapor"": V, A, P, O, R -> but R excluded?

D available.\n\nBut for position: first M, second A, third D, fourth A, fifth M.\n\nBut A is in second and fourth? So we are testing if fourth is A? But we don\'t know if there are two A\'s.\n\nThere might be two A\'s? For example, ""pampa"" or something.\n\nBut let\'s look for words with one A? If we are to find words with only one A? No, we can have multiple.\n\nBut for now, even words with multiple A\'s are possible.\n\n""delta"" D, E, L, T, A -> E, L, T excluded? Not.\n\n""vista"" V, I, S, T, A -> I, S, T excluded? Not.\n\n""tough"" T excluded? Not.\n\n""doubt"" D, O, U, B, T -> U and T excluded? Not.\n\nI think we need to consider less common letters.\n\nFor example, ""bapus"" is not a word.\n\n""vapid"" but we thought of it earlier? V, A, P, I, D -> but I is excluded now? From ""haiku"", I(x), so I is excluded. So not.\n\nSimilarly, ""vapid"" has I excluded.\n\nOh, so from ""haiku"", I, K, U, H are all excluded.\n\nWe cannot use those.\n\nSo available letters are: B, D, F, G, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.\n\nAnd A is fixed in second position.\n\nNow, possible words:\n- ""bobby"" but B? and Y excluded? Not.\n- ""dandy"" not.\n- ""food"" is four letters? Not five.\n- ""good"" not five.\n- ""booze"" B, O, O, Z, E -> E excluded? Not.\n- ""jumbo"" J, U, M, B, O -> U excluded? Not.\n- ""pizza"" P, I, Z, Z, A -> I excluded? And A is in fifth? But we need A in second. Pattern: _ A _ _ _ so A must be second.\n\nSo the word must have second letter A.\n\nThis is very restrictive.\n\nWords that come to mind: ""gamba"", ""gamma"", ""mamma"", ""pampa"", ""bacca"" not a word, ""cabal"" C and L? Not.\n\n""dacha"" D, A, C, H, A -> C and H excluded? Not.\n\n""fabio"" F, A, B, I, O -> I excluded? Not.\n\n""gawky"" W and Y? Not.\n\n""jammy"" J, A, M, M, Y -> Y excluded?

Not.\n\n"" wager"" W, A, G, E, R -> E and R excluded? Not.\n\nSo few options.\n\nWhat about ""wowee""? Not standard.\n\nI think ""abaci"" but A is not in second in ""abaci""? ""abaci"" is A,B,A,C,I -> first letter A, not second.\n\nBut we need second letter A.\n\nAnother: ""babul"" B, A, B, U, L -> U and L excluded? Not.\n\n""gadjo"" G, A, D, J, O -> letters G, D, J, O. J is available? We haven\'t excluded J. But is it a word? Gadjo is a word for a non-Roman in Romani culture? Might be obscure.\n\nSimilarly, ""gadge"" E excluded? Not.\n\nPerhaps ""maund""? M, A, U, N, D -> U and N excluded? Not.\n\n"" paul "" P, A, U, L, . -> but three letters? Not.\n\n"" racon "" R and C, not.\n\nHow about ""vamp"" is four letters.\n\n""wamus"" W, A, M, U, S -> U and S excluded? Not.\n\nI think we might be missing some common words.\n\nLet\'s try ""pawky"" P, A, W, K, Y -> K and Y excluded? Not.\n\nAnother idea: ""dazes"" but S and E? Not.\n\nPerhaps ""dabba"" D, A, B, B, A -> this is not English? But colloquial.\n\nIn standard English, what words are there?\n\n""manor"" M, A, N, O, R -> N and R excluded? Not.\n\n""major"" M, A, J, O, R -> R excluded? Not.\n\nWe need a word like ""bajra""? But not common.\n\nPerhaps ""beige"" E and I? Excluded.\n\nI think we need to consider that the secret word might have two A\'s? But then the positions.\n\nFor example, ""pampa"": P, A, M, P, A.\n\nSecond letter A, and fifth letter A.\n\nBut also P and M available.\n\nBut ""pampa"" is a word (meaning plains in South America).\n\nLetters: P, A, M, P, A. So P and M are the letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""gamma"": G, A, M, M, A.\n\nBut in ""gamma"", letters G, M.\n\nBoth are valid and use available letters.\n\nAnother: ""drama"" but R excluded.\n\nOr ""flamingo"" too long.\n\nSo perhaps ""pampa"" or ""gamma"".\n\nLet\'s choose between them.\n\n""Gamma"" has G and M.\n\n""Pampa"" has P and M.\n\nBoth use M.\n\nTo test more consonants, perhaps ""pampa"" because we could test P.\n\nOr ""gamma"" for G.\n\nBut both have duplicates? In ""pampa"", we have two P\'s and two A\'s.\n\nSimilarly in ""gamma"", two M\'s and two A\'s.\n\nSo if in the secret word, there is only one M or one P, we might not get accurate feedback? But the game handles it: if there is only one P, but we put two, then one might be marked correctly and the other absent? It\'s complicated.\n\nBut for now, since we have limited options, let\'s choose one.\n\nAnother word: ""bacca"" not a word, or ""sagas"" S excluded.\n\nHow about ""kappa""? K, A, P, P, A -> but K is excluded? From ""haiku"", K(x), so K is out.\n\nNot.\n\n""tappa"" T excluded.\n\nSo back to ""pampa"" or ""gamma"".\n\nOr ""bamba""?\n\nBut ""bamba"" might not be common.\n\nPerhaps ""d a o b b"" not a word.\n\nI think ""pampa"" is the best available.\n\nWe can also consider ""mafia"" but F, I, A -> I is excluded? From ""haiku"", I(x), so not.\n\nSimilarly, ""facia"" F, A, C, I, A -> C and I excluded? Not.\n\nSo, I will guess ""pampa"".\n\nTherefore, next guess is ""pampa"".\n\nBut note: the first letter P, the second A (correct), the third M, the fourth P, the fifth A.\n\nNow, if there are two A\'s vs one, etc.\n\nBut let\'s hope it is valid.\n\nAnother option: ""vodka"" but O, D, K, A -> K excluded? Not.\n\n""vodka"" has V, O, D, K, A. But second letter O, not A.\n\nNot.\n\nSo ""pampa"" it is.\n\n<guess>pampa</guess>After reviewing the previous guesses and feedback:\n1. **Guess 1: crane**  \n   Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  \n   - A is in the secret word but not in position 3.\n   - C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.\n\n2. **Guess 2: salty**  \n   Feedback: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)  \n   - A is confirmed in position 2.\n   - S, L, T, Y are not in the secret word.\n\n3. **Guess 3: haiku**  \n   Feedback: H(x) A(✓) I(x) K(x) U(x)  \n   - A is again confirmed in position 2 (no change).\n   - H, I, K, U are not in the secret word.\n\n### Key deductions:\n- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A _ _ _` (A in position 2).\n- **Excluded letters** (all marked \'x\' in previous guesses): C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y, H, I, K, U.  \n- **Available letters** (not tested or not excluded): B, D, F, G, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  \n- From the first guess, A was misplaced in position 3, suggesting A may not be in that position (though multiple A\'s are possible).\n- Given the feedback, the word is likely uncommon due to the limited options.\n\n### Approach for the next guess:\n- Focus on the pattern `_ A _ _ _` and use only available letters.\n- Prioritize common consonants and vowels from the available pool (e.g., B, D, F, G, M, O, P, V) to test new letters efficiently.\n- Given the constraints, words with double letters may be unavoidable; ""pampa"" (meaning plains in South America) is a valid 5-letter word fitting:\n  - Positions: P (position 1), A (position 2, fixed), M (position 3), P (position 4), A (position 5).\n- This guess tests:\n  - P in positions 1 and 4.\n  - M in position 3.\n  - A in position 5 (since position 2 is fixed; we haven\'t tested A elsewhere yet).\n- If the secret word has only one A, position 5 A would be marked \'x\' or \'-\' depending on location.\n\n<guess>pampa</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: haiku -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) I(x) K(x) U(x)\nGuess 4: pampa -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) M(✓) P(x) A(✓)\n'}]","<think>

- Position 1: P(x) → P is not in the secret word at all (since both P's got 'x', meaning no P in the word).
- Position 2: A(✓) → A is correct and in position 2 (as before).
- Position 3: M(✓) → M is correct and in position 3.
- Position 4: P(x) → P is not in the word (as above).
- Position 5: A(✓) → A is correct and in position 5.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- A in position 2 and position 5.
- M in position 3.
- No P at all (since both P's are marked 'x').

So the secret word pattern is: _ A M _ A

And letters excluded: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y, H, I, K, U, P.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, O, Q, V, W, X, Z (since A and M are already placed).

Now, the word is of the form: ? A M ? A

We need to fill the first and fourth positions with letters from the available set, excluding the used letters except we know A and M are placed.

The fourth position must be filled, and it must be a letter that, when placed there, forms a word.

Also, note that from first guess ""crane"", we had A in position 3 marked as '-', meaning that A was present but in the wrong position. Now we know that the secret word has A in positions 2 and 5, so that A in position 3 from ""crane"" was likely referring to one of these existing A's? But since position 3 was M, and A wasn't there, it's consistent. There are two A's in the word.

Now, possible words:
First letter: one of B, D, F, G, O, Q, V, W, X, Z
Fourth letter: one of B, D, F, G, O, Q, V, W, X, Z

Common words: ""drama"" but R excluded? R is excluded.

""gamma"" but G? And M in position 3 is correct, but ""gamma"" has M in position 3 and 4? Positions: G, A, M, M, A. But we have the pattern ? A M ? A. For ""gamma"", it would be position 1: G, position 4: M.

But in our feedback from ""pampa"", we also have A(✓) at position 5. In ""gamma"", position 5 is A, so that matches? But the fourth letter? In our pattern, fourth letter is the fourth position.

But in ""gamma"", position 4 is M. But we already have M in position 3? And we haven't tested another M at position 4? But we know from ""pampa"" that position 4 is not P, and we don't know about M elsewhere.

However, we need to guess a word that fits ? A M ? A.

For example, ""gamma"": 
- Position 1: G
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: M
- Position 4: M (but we are to put a letter here? We don't know if M can be here)
- Position 5: A

Similarly, ""dampa""? Not a word.

Another word: ""famba""? Not a word.

""bam"" is three.

Common words: ""cameo"" but C and E excluded? Not.

""watch"" but T and H excluded? Not.

Since we have O available, ""mama"" is four letters.

""jamba""? Not standard.

Perhaps ""lambda"" too long.

I think ""gamma"" is a candidate?

""dadaa"" not a word.

Another: ""wanna"" W, A, N, N, A -> N excluded? Not.

""fanny"" F, A, N, N, Y -> N and Y excluded? Not.

""varna"" V, A, R, N, A -> R and N excluded? Not.

""tappa"" T excluded? Not.

""gamba"" G, A, M, B, A -> but in the pattern, position 3 is M? But ""gamba"" has M in position 3? And A in 2 and 5? Positions: 
1: G
2: A
3: M? ""gamba"" is G,A,M,B,A → so:
Position 1: G
Position 2: A
Position 3: M → correct
Position 4: B
Position 5: A → correct

Oh, ""gamba"" fits the pattern: _ A M _ A → with position 4 as B.

And letters: G, B available? B is in our available list.

Is ""gamba"" a word? Gamba is a musical term for a type of viol or a leg of veal? It might be accepted.

Similarly, ""dalta"" D, A, L, T, A → L and T excluded? Not.

""bomb"" not five.

""gamma"" we have, which is G,A,M,M,A → but it has two M's? And our pattern requires the fourth letter to be M? But we don't have M in the pattern for position 4? No, the pattern is ? A M ? A, so fourth letter can be anything.

In ""gamma"", we would put G in position 1 and M in position 4.

But we already know M is in the word? And we have it in position 3? So M could be elsewhere.

But in ""gamma"", if the secret word were ""gamma"", then position 3 M is correct (as we have), and position 4 M would need to be tested? And position 5 A is correct.

For ""gamba"", we have position 4: B.

So between ""gamma"" and ""gamba"", both are acceptable? But we need to choose one.

Also, ""facia"" F,A,C,I,A → C and I excluded? Not.

""wadia"" W,A,D,I,A → I excluded? Not.

""magma"" M,A,G,M,A? But position 1 M? And we have M in position 3? So it has two M's? But ""magma"" is M,A,G,M,A → so:
Position 1: M
Position 2: A
Position 3: G? But we know position 3 must be M! So it doesn't fit because position 3 is G? Not matching.

We know position 3 is M, so it must be M there.

Therefore, valid words must have M at position 3.

Thus, ""gamma"" has:
1: G
2: A
3: M
4: M → we don't know if this is possible?
5: A

""gamba"" has:
1: G
2: A
3: M
4: B? or is it B? G,A,M,B,A → so position 4: B
5: A

Now, which one? Also, ""delta"" not.

Another word: ""gamp"" is four letters.

Perhaps ""daman"" D,A,M,A,N → N excluded? Not.

""qorma"" Q,O,R,M,A → R excluded? Not.

""oak"" not enough.

I think ""gamma"" and ""gamba"" are candidates.

Given that in ""pampa"" we had P and it was excluded, we can guess. But now, we must guess.

But note: the first position and the fourth position must be filled with available letters.

For ""gamba"": G and B.

For ""gamma"": G and M? But M is already in position 3? So the fourth position being M would imply two M's? But we haven't seen that?

In ""pampa"", we had M at position 3 correct, but no feedback about M elsewhere because we didn't place M elsewhere? In ""pampa"", we placed M at position 3 and it was correct. We placed A at 2 and 5 correct. But we don't know about other M's? So it's possible that there is another M? But unlikely? Or not.

To be safe, we can guess ""gamma"" to check for M? Or ""gamba"" to test B.

But since we have few tries left, we need to be efficient.

Another word: ""dawba"" not standard.

""faxed"" not.

I think ""gamma"" is a more common word? Or perhaps not.

Given that we are at guess 4 and we have 2 tries left? We started with guess 1,2,3,4, now guess 5, then 6 remains.

So we can try one.

To avoid giving away, I think ""gamma"" is a valid word.

But let's see: in ""pampa"", the feedback for position 4 P was x, meaning P is not in the word, but we don't know about other letters.

Similarly, we have no information about G or B.

Perhaps guess ""dam"" something.

Another word: ""vanda"" V,A,N,D,A → N excluded? Not.

So we choose ""gamma"".

Then, if it is not, we try other.

But perhaps ""gamba"" is better because it tests a new letter B.

If we guess ""gamma"", and if position 4 is M, we get M(✓) for position 4? Then position 1 G might be ✓ or not? But we can find out.

Whereas ""gamba"" would have position 4 as B.

But let's estimate likelihood.

Most common words: words with pattern _AMA_A.

In English, words like ""gamma"", ""drama"" (drama with R? excluded), ""gamba"", ""kamba"", ""mamba"", etc.

""Mamba"" M,A,M,B,A → but position 1 M, position 3 M? But we need M at position 3? And position 1? M? And we haven't excluded M? But then ""mamba"" has positions: M,A,M,B,A → so position 1: M, position 2: A, position 3: M, position 4: B, position 5: A.

Position 3 is M? Then it matches? But position 1 is M? And position 3 is M again? So two M's?

But we don't know if that's possible.

Similarly, we have ""gamma"".

And ""gamba"".

Both are reasonable.

But we have ""pampa"" which had M only at position 3 and it was correct, and no other M? But we didn't test.

So for efficiency, I think ""gamba"" is better because it tests a new letter B at position 4, whereas ""gamma"" tests M at position 4 which is redundant if we already know M at position 3 and if there is only one M? But since we placed M at position 4 in ""gamma"", if M is at position 3 already, the extra M would be marked accordingly.

In Wordle, duplicate letters: if there is only one M, then the M at position 3 is correct, so at position 4 it should be absent? Or present? But in this case, secret word has one M, then if we put M at position 3 (correct) and M at position 4, then position 3 would be ✓, and position 4 would be x because there is only one M.

But if there are two M's, position 4 could be ✓ or -.

But to avoid that complexity, choosing ""gamba"" gives us information about B.

I'll choose ""gamba"".

So next guess: ""gamba""

But let's confirm spelling: ""gamba"" is a 5-letter word.

Yes.

Therefore, <guess>gamba</guess>
</think>
From the feedback of ""pampa"":  
- P is absent (marked 'x' in both positions), so P is not in the secret word.  
- A is correct and in position 2 (marked '✓').  
- M is correct and in position 3 (marked '✓').  
- A is correct and in position 5 (marked '✓').  

Thus, the secret word pattern is: **? A M ? A**, with the confirmed letters A at positions 2 and 5, and M at position 3.  
- Excluded letters (from all previous feedback): C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y, H, I, K, U, P.  
- Available letters for positions 1 and 4: B, D, F, G, O, Q, V, W, X, Z.  

The guess ""gamba"" (G, A, M, B, A) fits this pattern:  
- Position 2 is A (confirmed).  
- Position 3 is M (confirmed).  
- Position 5 is A (confirmed).  
- Positions 1 and 4 test new letters: G and B, both from the available set.  

""Gamba"" is a valid English word (a musical term or short for gamba violin). It tests G in position 1 and B in position 4, prioritizing common consonants to maximize information gain.  

<guess>gamba</guess>",gamba,"We are given feedback for four guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
2. ""salty"": S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)
3. ""haiku"": H(x), A(✓), I(x), K(x), U(x)
4. ""pampa"": P(x), A(✓), M(✓), P(x), A(✓)

From the feedback of ""pampa"":
- Position 1: P(x) → P is not in the secret word at all (since both P's got 'x', meaning no P in the word).
- Position 2: A(✓) → A is correct and in position 2 (as before).
- Position 3: M(✓) → M is correct and in position 3.
- Position 4: P(x) → P is not in the word (as above).
- Position 5: A(✓) → A is correct and in position 5.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- A in position 2 and position 5.
- M in position 3.
- No P at all (since both P's are marked 'x').

So the secret word pattern is: _ A M _ A

And letters excluded: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y, H, I, K, U, P.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, O, Q, V, W, X, Z (since A and M are already placed).

Now, the word is of the form: ? A M ? A

Now, possible words:

Fourth letter: one of B, D, F, G, O, Q, V, W, X, Z

Common words: ""drama"" but R excluded? R is excluded.

""gamma"" but G? And M in position 3 is correct, but ""gamma"" has M in position 3 and 4? Positions: G, A, M, M, A. But we have the pattern ? A M ? A. For ""gamma"", it would be position 1: G, position 4: M.

But in our feedback from ""pampa"", we also have A(✓) at position 5. In ""gamma"", position 5 is A, so that matches? But the fourth letter? In our pattern, fourth letter is the fourth position.

But in ""gamma"", position 4 is M. But we already have M in position 3? And we haven't tested another M at position 4? But we know from ""pampa"" that position 4 is not P, and we don't know about M elsewhere.

However, we need to guess a word that fits ? A M ? A.

We know position 3 is M, so it must be M there.

Therefore, valid words must have M at position 3.

I'll choose ""gamba"".

So next guess: ""gamba""

Therefore, <guess>gamba</guess>From the feedback of ""pampa"":  
- P is absent (marked 'x' in both positions), so P is not in the secret word.  
- A is correct and in position 2 (marked '✓').

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,6,GAMMA,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, from this we know:
- The letter 'A' is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since we placed it in the third position and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'A' and does not contain C, R, N, E.

For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, N, E (since they are absent).
- Includes the letter 'A' (since we know it's present) but in a different position (not position 3).
- We might also want to include other common letters to get more information.

Since we know 'A' is in the word, we can try to place it in a different position. Also, we should avoid the letters that we now know are absent.

Let's think of a word that:
- Has 5 letters, all different to maximize information (if possible).
- Contains 'A' but not in the third position.
- Avoids C, R, N, E.

Common vowels besides 'A' and 'E' (which is out) are 'I', 'O', 'U'. But we also have consonants.

We can try to use other common letters: S, T, L, P, H, etc.

One common starting word is ""salet"", but note that we have to avoid R and E. So ""salet"" has E and R? Actually, ""salet"" has E and T? Let me check: S, A, L, E, T. But E is out, so we cannot use E.

Another common word is ""audio"" but that has 5 vowels and we know A is present, but we need more consonants.

Alternatively, we can try ""stamp"":
- S, T, A, M, P
- A is in the third position? But in our previous guess, A was in the third position and it was misplaced. So in the secret word, A is not in the third position. Therefore, we should put A in a different position.

Let me try to put A in the second position? Or the first? Or the fourth? Or the fifth?

We don't know, so we can try a word that has A in a different position, say the second.

For example, ""laugh"": but note that we have to avoid R, and also G and H are common? But we don't know about them.

But we also want to test other common letters.

Another idea: since we know A is present, and we have only one known letter, we can try to use a word that has A and four new letters.

Let me list some words without C, R, N, E and with A in a position other than 3.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

Let me try to form a word with A in the second position: for example, ""palsy"": P, A, L, S, Y. But we don't know about P, L, S, Y.

Alternatively, ""fault"": F, A, U, L, T. But we don't know about F, U, L, T.

But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N, E.

So, let's try to choose a word that has A and also includes other common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as S, T, L, I, O, etc.

I think ""staid"" is a good candidate? But let's check: S, T, A, I, D. 
- A is in the third position? We want to avoid the third position because in the secret word A is not in the third. But wait, in our first guess we had A in the third and it was misplaced, meaning the secret word has A but not in the third. So in the next guess, we should put A in a different position.

Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the third position again.

So for ""staid"", A is in the third? That's the same as before. We don't want that.

How about ""aisle"": A, I, S, L, E -> but E is out! We cannot use E.

Another word: ""aloft"": A, L, O, F, T -> A is in the first position. This is good because we haven't tested A in the first position.

But we don't know about L, O, F, T.

Alternatively, ""about"": A, B, O, U, T -> A in first. But we don't know about B, O, U, T.

But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another common word: ""adieu"" but that has E? No, ""adieu"" is A, D, I, E, U -> E is out, so we cannot use.

How about ""audio"": A, U, D, I, O -> that's all vowels? But we know A is present, and we can test U, D, I, O.

But we might get less information because vowels are less frequent? However, we have to avoid consonants that we haven't tested? Actually, we haven't tested many consonants.

Alternatively, we can try ""piano"": P, I, A, N, O -> but N is out! We know N is absent. So we cannot use N.

We must avoid N.

So let me think of words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E.

Here's a list of possible words without C, R, N, E and with A not in the third position:

- Position 1: A, then four other letters (not C, R, N, E). Examples: ""about"", ""above"" (but V and B? and O, U, T), ""adapt"" (but D, A, P, T; but A is in first and third? We don't want A in third? Actually, we can have A in multiple positions? But the word must be valid. However, we know the secret word has at least one A, but we don't know if it has more. But in ""adapt"", we have two A's? But we don't know if the secret word has two A's. Also, we are avoiding C, R, N, E, so ""adapt"" is A, D, A, P, T? Wait, that's two A's. But the word ""adapt"" has A in first and third. We are trying to test A in a new position, but we are also putting it in the third again? We want to avoid the third because we know the secret word's A is not in the third? Actually, we don't know if there is a second A. But we are only sure about one A. So it's okay to put A in the third again? But that might not be efficient because we already know that the A is not in the third. So if we put A in the third again and it shows as absent (x) or correct (✓)? Actually, if we put A in the third and it is the same A we already know, then it should be either misplaced again (if the secret word has only one A and it's not in third) or correct (if the secret word has two A's and one is in third). But we don't know. However, to maximize information, it's better to try A in a new position.

So I think we should avoid the third position for A in this guess.

Therefore, let's look for words that have A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and avoid C, R, N, E.

Another idea: ""salty"": S, A, L, T, Y -> A in second position. This avoids the third. And the letters S, L, T, Y are new.

But we don't know about S, L, T, Y.

Alternatively, ""focal"" but has C and L? C is out, so we cannot use C.

We must avoid C.

So ""salty"" seems good: S, A, L, T, Y.

But we also have the option to test more common letters. The most common consonants in English are T, N, S, H, R, ... but we know N and R are out. So T and S are very common.

Therefore, ""salty"" is a good candidate.

Another word: ""patio"": P, A, T, I, O -> A in second position. This also tests P, T, I, O.

But we don't know about P, T, I, O.

I think both are good. Let me choose one.

Alternatively, we can use ""stamp"" but then A is in the third? We don't want that. So avoid.

How about ""tally"": T, A, L, L, Y -> but has double L? That might not be ideal because we get less information about distinct letters. So better to have all distinct letters.

""Salty"" has distinct letters: S, A, L, T, Y.

""Patio"" has distinct: P, A, T, I, O.

I think ""patio"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (A and I, O) and two common consonants (P, T). But we already know A is present, so we are testing I, O, P, T.

But ""salty"" has S, A, L, T, Y. S and T are very common.

I think I'll go with ""salty"" because it has S and T which are high frequency.

But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N, E. ""salty"" does not contain any of these.

So let's choose ""salty"".

But wait, we have to consider that the secret word has an A that is not in the third position. In ""salty"", we are putting A in the second position. That's a new position.

Therefore, I will guess ""salty"".

But let me double-check: 
- First guess: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
- So we know A is present and not in position 3.

Now, with ""salty"":
- If the A in the second position is correct, we get a ✓ for A.
- If not, we might get a '-' for A (if the secret word has A but not in second) or even an 'x' (if there is only one A and it's not in second, but we know there is at least one A so it would be '-' if not in second? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one A and it is in a position that is not second, then we would get '-' for A because it is present but misplaced. But if we get an 'x' for A, that would mean there is no A at all? But we know there is an A, so we should never get an 'x' for A. Therefore, for A we can only get either ✓ (if it's in the second position) or '-' (if it's in the word but not in second). But note: we are putting A in the second position, and we know the secret word has an A that is not in the third. It could be in the second? We don't know.

So by putting A in the second, we are testing if the A is in the second position.

Also, we are testing S, L, T, Y.

Therefore, I think ""salty"" is a good guess.

Alternatively, we could try to put A in the first position? For example, ""about"". But we don't know about B, O, U, T.

I think ""salty"" is fine.

So my next guess: ""salty""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked as ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, R, N, E.
- Include A, but not in the third position to test a new location.
- Choose a word with common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, Y) to maximize information.
- ""salty"" fits these criteria: A is in the second position, and it tests new letters (S, L, T, Y) while avoiding the excluded letters.

<guess>salty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"" : C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
2. ""salty"" : S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)

From the feedback, we know:
- The letter 'A' is in the secret word and in the correct position. From ""salty"", A is in the second position and got a ✓. So the second letter of the secret word is A.
- From ""salty"": S, L, T, Y are all absent (x). So S, L, T, Y are not in the secret word.
- From ""crane"": C, R, E are absent (x) and N is also absent. So we know the secret word does not contain C, R, E, N, and now also S, L, T, Y.

Therefore, the set of excluded letters is: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y.

And we know that the second letter is A.

So the secret word pattern is: _ A _ _ _

Now, what letters can be used? We need to avoid the excluded letters: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y.

Also, we have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, T, Y in our guesses. Note that A is confirmed and placed, so for the other positions, we need new letters.

The alphabet minus the excluded letters: 
Excluded: C, E, N, R, S, T, L, Y. That's 8 letters.
Remaining letters: A (but already placed), B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But A is already used and placed correctly, so for the other positions, we use letters from the remaining set: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Also, we know from the first guess that A was misplaced in position 3 (from ""crane""), but now we know the secret word has A in position 2. And since we got a ✓ for A in position 2 in ""salty"", that means the A in position 3 in ""crane"" was not correct and there might be only one A? But wait, it's possible that the word has two A's? However, in the feedback for ""crane"", we got a '-' for A in position 3, meaning it's present but not in position 3. But now we have an A in position 2 confirmed. So if the word has only one A, then that A is in position 2, so any other A would get an x? But in ""salty"", we placed A only in position 2, and other positions had other letters. But we didn't place A elsewhere.

So we don't know if there are more A's. But since the word must have an A and it is in position 2, the '-' for A in position 3 from ""crane"" could be because that A is the same one? But no, because if there is only one A, then when we put it in position 3 in ""crane"", it should be '-' meaning it exists elsewhere, and now we found it in position 2. So if we put A in position 3 again, it should be x? But we know it's not in position 3. So we can avoid having A in other positions? Or test for another A.

But for now, let's assume there might be only one A until proven otherwise.

Now, the secret word is _ A _ _ _

We need to find a word that fits: 
Second letter is A.
Does not contain: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y (and the other excluded letters).

Also, we haven't tested many letters, so we should choose a word with as many new common letters as possible from the remaining set.

Common letters from the remaining: vowels I and O, consonants B, D, F, G, H, M, P, etc.

Possible words: we need a word of the form ?A???.

Examples: 
- ""gaudy"" but Y is excluded? Y is in the excluded list. So not.
- ""happy"" but P? and Y excluded.
- ""daddy"" but D? and Y excluded and double D? Not great because we want distinct letters to maximize info? But not necessary.

But we need to avoid the excluded letters.

I think ""bacon"" but C and N are excluded? Not.

Another: ""fable"" but E is excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""habit"": H, A, B, I, T -> but T is excluded? T is in the excluded list. So no.

Excluded: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y.

So avoid T.

Possible words: ""manor"" but M, A, N, O, R -> but N and R excluded? R is excluded.

Not.

""papal"" but P, A, P, A, L -> L excluded? L and doubled P and A.

But L is excluded.

We need to find a word with second letter A and no C,R,E,N,S,L,T,Y.

Let me try: ""kabob"" but K? and B? but O? Also, it has two B's and two O's? not efficient.

Perhaps ""radio"" but R excluded? R is excluded.

""magic"" but C excluded.

This is tricky.

Another: ""haiku"": H, A, I, K, U -> letters: H, I, K, U are not excluded. And A is in second.

So ""haiku"": 
- H, A, I, K, U

All letters are allowed: H, A, I, K, U. A is in second.

Now, H, I, K, U are new letters.

This seems like a valid word.

Other options: 
- ""fairy"" but R and Y excluded? Not.
- ""giant"" but T excluded? Not.
- ""bakes"" but S excluded? Not.

""quake"" but E excluded? Not.

""vapid"": V, A, P, I, D -> V, P, I, D are new and not excluded.

""vapid"" is a word.

But ""haiku"" and ""vapid"" are both options.

Also, ""habit"" has T excluded? Not.

Another: ""daisy"" but S and Y excluded? Not.

We could try ""jacks"" but C and S excluded? Not.

So ""haiku"" or ""vapid""?

I think ""haiku"" is more common? Or not, but it is a word.

To test vowels: I and U. Or consonants: H, K.

Similarly, ""vapid"" has V, P, I, D. V and P are less common.

But we want to test common letters? But we have few options.

Another possibility: ""balmy"" but L and Y excluded? Not.

""cabin"" but C and N excluded? Not.

""habit"" is invalid because of T.

How about ""manic"" but C and N excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""waist"" but S and T excluded? Not.

So I think ""haiku"" is a reasonable choice.

Alternatively, ""capri"" but C and R excluded? Not.

So I'll go with ""haiku"".

Therefore, next guess: ""haiku""

But note: the secret word has at least one A, and we are putting A in the second position which is correct.

Now, we are testing H, I, K, U in positions 1, 3, 4, 5.

If any of these are present and in the correct position, we get ✓, or misplaced, we get '-'.

This should give us good information.

But wait: we know from the first guess that A was in the wrong position at position 3. Now that we have placed A correctly at position 2, so in the first guess, A was at position 3 and was misplaced, meaning the secret word's A is not at position 3. Therefore, in ""haiku"", if the secret word has another A? But we are not placing any other A. But in position 3, we are placing I, so that's fine. Since we know position 3 cannot have A (because from the first feedback), so we should not put A there anyway.

So I think ""haiku"" is a good guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""haiku"".Based on the previous feedback:
- From ""crane"": C, R, N, E are not in the secret word, and A is present but not in position 3.
- From ""salty"": S, L, T, Y are not in the secret word, and A is confirmed in position 2.

The secret word has the pattern: _ A _ _ _, and excludes the letters C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y. The next guess should prioritize testing new common vowels and consonants from the remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z) to gain maximum information.

""Haiku"" is chosen as the next guess because:
- It fits the pattern (_ A _ _ _) and avoids excluded letters.
- It introduces four new untested letters: H, I, K, U.
- It tests common vowels (I and U) and consonants (H and K) that may reveal positions or presence in the secret word.
- Since A is already confirmed in position 2, the focus shifts to solving the other positions efficiently.

<guess>haiku</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)
Guess 3: haiku -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) I(x) K(x) U(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for three guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
2. ""salty"": S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)
3. ""haiku"": H(x), A(✓), I(x), K(x), U(x)

From the feedback:
- We know the second letter is A (from ""salty"" and ""haiku"").
- Excluded letters (those marked 'x' in all guesses): C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y, H, I, K, U. So the secret word does not contain these letters.
- The only known included letter is A, and it is in position 2.

The secret word pattern: _ A _ _ _

We must avoid using any of the excluded letters: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y, H, I, K, U.

Available letters are those not excluded: 
All letters minus the above. 
Remaining: A (but already placed), B, D, F, G, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. 
And possibly other vowels? O is available, and consonants.

We must form a word that has second letter A, and uses only the available letters for the other positions: 1, 3, 4, 5.

Also, note that from the first guess (""crane""), A was misplaced in position 3. Now that we know A is fixed in position 2, this means there is no other A in the word? Or at least, if there were another A, it might be in a different position? But in ""haiku"", we did not put A in position 3, so we don't have information about other positions. However, in the first guess, A was placed in position 3 and got a '-', meaning it is present but not in that position. Since we now know A is in position 2, that A in position 3 must be the same one? Meaning there is only one A? Because if there were two A's, then in the first guess, position 3 A could have been a different A? But in Wordle, the feedback indicates if a letter is correct or present regardless of duplication? Actually, Wordle handles duplicated letters: if there are two of the same letter, you might get multiple marks. But in this case, the first guess ""crane"" had one A in position 3, and we got a '-' meaning it is present but wrong position. Since we now found A in position 2, it implies that A exists exactly once? Not necessarily, but it's possible.

However, we can't assume only one A. We must be cautious.

But for efficiency, let's assume only one A until we have evidence otherwise.

Now, given the available letters: B, D, F, G, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a word: letter1 A letter3 letter4 letter5.

Possible words? We must think of words that fit.

Examples:
- ""gamba"" but has two A's? And B. But also M? ""gamba"" is G,A,M,B,A. But if we assume only one A, this might not be good. Also, letters: G, M, B are allowed? But let's see: G, A, M, B, A. We have two A's. But our pattern requires A in position 2, and then the other letters. If we use ""gamba"", letter4 is B and letter5 is A. But then the word must not have other A's? We don't know.

Perhaps not.

Another: ""balsa"" but S excluded? Not.

""papaw"" but P and W? ""papaw"" has two P's and two A's? P, A, P, A, W.

But A in position 2 and 4? That might be possible.

But S and L are excluded? In this word, letters are P, A, P, A, W. P and W are available? We haven't excluded P or W.

Other options: 
- ""drama"" but R excluded? R is excluded.

""gamma"" but M? and two M's and A's? G, A, M, M, A.

But letters: G, M. Available? Yes.

But this has two M's and two A's? Not ideal.

We need to choose a word that uses distinct letters to maximize information? But it's hard.

""baker"" but E and R excluded? Not.

""favor"" but F and V and O? and R excluded? R is excluded, so not.

""major"" but R excluded? Not.

""naval"" but L excluded? Not.

""pagan"" but G and N excluded? N excluded.

Not.

""wacky"" but C and Y excluded? Not.

""baddy"" but D? and Y excluded? Not.

""faddy"" same issue.

""gawky"" but W? and Y excluded? Not.

This seems difficult.

What about ""baggy""? B, A, G, G, Y -> but Y excluded? Not.

Another idea: ""daffy"" but D, A, F, F, Y -> Y excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""mambo"": M, A, M, B, O -> two M's? Letters: M, A, B, O. All available? M, B, O are available.

Is ""mambo"" a word? Yes.

Similarly, ""gumbo"": G, U, M, B, O. But U excluded? U is marked absent from ""haiku"". Yes, U is excluded.

So not ""gumbo"".

But ""mambo"" has U? No, ""mambo"": M, A, M, B, O.

But U is not in it? ""mambo"" has M, A, M, B, O. So vowels: A and O; consonants: M, M, B.

We are testing M, B, O? But we are putting multiple M's? So if M is in the word, we might get feedback accordingly.

But we don't know if M is in the word.

But we have to guess something.

Alternatively, ""vapor"": V, A, P, O, R -> but R excluded? Not.

""favor"": F, A, V, O, R -> R excluded? Not.

What about ""maple""? But L excluded? Not.

""oasis"" but S excluded? Not.

""azure"" but E and R? and U? Excluded? U is excluded? Let me check: ""azure"" is A, Z, U, R, E. U, R, E excluded? Not.

""brave"" but B, R, A, V, E -> R excluded? Not.

I think I need to use a dictionary search mentally.

Another common word: ""panda"" but P, A, N, D, A -> N excluded? Not.

""dandy"" D, A, N, D, Y -> N and Y excluded? Not.

""mammy"" M, A, M, M, Y -> Y excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""magma"": M, A, G, M, A -> two M's and two A's? G available.

But this has repeated letters.

To get different letters: ""badge"" but D, G, E? E excluded? Not.

""large""? R and E excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""cable"" but C excluded? Not.

This is tough.

What about ""gaffe""? G, A, F, F, E -> E excluded? Not.

""fauna"" F, A, U, N, A -> U and N excluded? Not.

""pasta"" P, A, S, T, A -> S and T excluded? Not.

""wafer"" W, A, F, E, R -> E and R excluded? Not.

""bacon"" B, A, C, O, N -> C and N excluded? Not.

Finally, ""booza"" is not a word.

Perhaps ""gamba"" is acceptable? But it has two A's.

We haven't tested B, G, M? and O?

Another word: ""daddy"" not allowed because of Y.

""pappy"" P, A, P, P, Y -> Y excluded and multiple P's? Not.

""happy"" H and Y excluded? Not.

We must avoid excluded letters.

How about ""macro""? M, A, C, R, O -> C and R excluded? Not.

""extra"" E, X, T, R, A -> E, T, R excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""woman"" W, O, M, A, N -> N excluded? Not.

""madam"" M, A, D, A, M -> this has two M's and two A's? D available.

But for position: first M, second A, third D, fourth A, fifth M.

But A is in second and fourth? So we are testing if fourth is A? But we don't know if there are two A's.

There might be two A's? For example, ""pampa"" or something.

But let's look for words with one A? If we are to find words with only one A? No, we can have multiple.

But for now, even words with multiple A's are possible.

""delta"" D, E, L, T, A -> E, L, T excluded? Not.

""vista"" V, I, S, T, A -> I, S, T excluded? Not.

""tough"" T excluded? Not.

""doubt"" D, O, U, B, T -> U and T excluded? Not.

I think we need to consider less common letters.

For example, ""bapus"" is not a word.

""vapid"" but we thought of it earlier? V, A, P, I, D -> but I is excluded now? From ""haiku"", I(x), so I is excluded. So not.

Similarly, ""vapid"" has I excluded.

Oh, so from ""haiku"", I, K, U, H are all excluded.

We cannot use those.

So available letters are: B, D, F, G, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

And A is fixed in second position.

Now, possible words:
- ""bobby"" but B? and Y excluded? Not.
- ""dandy"" not.
- ""food"" is four letters? Not five.
- ""good"" not five.
- ""booze"" B, O, O, Z, E -> E excluded? Not.
- ""jumbo"" J, U, M, B, O -> U excluded? Not.
- ""pizza"" P, I, Z, Z, A -> I excluded? And A is in fifth? But we need A in second. Pattern: _ A _ _ _ so A must be second.

So the word must have second letter A.

This is very restrictive.

Words that come to mind: ""gamba"", ""gamma"", ""mamma"", ""pampa"", ""bacca"" not a word, ""cabal"" C and L? Not.

""dacha"" D, A, C, H, A -> C and H excluded? Not.

""fabio"" F, A, B, I, O -> I excluded? Not.

""gawky"" W and Y? Not.

""jammy"" J, A, M, M, Y -> Y excluded? Not.

""karma"" K excluded? Not.

""langa"" L excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""manga"" M, A, N, G, A -> N excluded? Not.

""nappy"" N and Y? Not.

""paddy"" P, A, D, D, Y -> Y excluded? Not.

""quale"" Q, U, A, L, E -> U, L, E excluded? Not.

""radar"" R excluded? Not.

""samba"" S excluded? Not.

""tappa"" T excluded? Not.

""vanga"" V, A, N, G, A -> N excluded? Not.

"" wager"" W, A, G, E, R -> E and R excluded? Not.

So few options.

What about ""wowee""? Not standard.

I think ""abaci"" but A is not in second in ""abaci""? ""abaci"" is A,B,A,C,I -> first letter A, not second.

But we need second letter A.

Another: ""babul"" B, A, B, U, L -> U and L excluded? Not.

""gadjo"" G, A, D, J, O -> letters G, D, J, O. J is available? We haven't excluded J. But is it a word? Gadjo is a word for a non-Roman in Romani culture? Might be obscure.

Similarly, ""gadge"" E excluded? Not.

Perhaps ""maund""? M, A, U, N, D -> U and N excluded? Not.

"" paul "" P, A, U, L, . -> but three letters? Not.

"" racon "" R and C, not.

How about ""vamp"" is four letters.

""wamus"" W, A, M, U, S -> U and S excluded? Not.

I think we might be missing some common words.

Let's try ""pawky"" P, A, W, K, Y -> K and Y excluded? Not.

Another idea: ""dazes"" but S and E? Not.

Perhaps ""dabba"" D, A, B, B, A -> this is not English? But colloquial.

In standard English, what words are there?

""manor"" M, A, N, O, R -> N and R excluded? Not.

""major"" M, A, J, O, R -> R excluded? Not.

We need a word like ""bajra""? But not common.

Perhaps ""beige"" E and I? Excluded.

I think we need to consider that the secret word might have two A's? But then the positions.

For example, ""pampa"": P, A, M, P, A.

Second letter A, and fifth letter A.

But also P and M available.

But ""pampa"" is a word (meaning plains in South America).

Letters: P, A, M, P, A. So P and M are the letters.

Similarly, ""gamma"": G, A, M, M, A.

But in ""gamma"", letters G, M.

Both are valid and use available letters.

Another: ""drama"" but R excluded.

Or ""flamingo"" too long.

So perhaps ""pampa"" or ""gamma"".

Let's choose between them.

""Gamma"" has G and M.

""Pampa"" has P and M.

Both use M.

To test more consonants, perhaps ""pampa"" because we could test P.

Or ""gamma"" for G.

But both have duplicates? In ""pampa"", we have two P's and two A's.

Similarly in ""gamma"", two M's and two A's.

So if in the secret word, there is only one M or one P, we might not get accurate feedback? But the game handles it: if there is only one P, but we put two, then one might be marked correctly and the other absent? It's complicated.

But for now, since we have limited options, let's choose one.

Another word: ""bacca"" not a word, or ""sagas"" S excluded.

How about ""kappa""? K, A, P, P, A -> but K is excluded? From ""haiku"", K(x), so K is out.

Not.

""tappa"" T excluded.

So back to ""pampa"" or ""gamma"".

Or ""bamba""?

But ""bamba"" might not be common.

Perhaps ""d a o b b"" not a word.

I think ""pampa"" is the best available.

We can also consider ""mafia"" but F, I, A -> I is excluded? From ""haiku"", I(x), so not.

Similarly, ""facia"" F, A, C, I, A -> C and I excluded? Not.

So, I will guess ""pampa"".

Therefore, next guess is ""pampa"".

But note: the first letter P, the second A (correct), the third M, the fourth P, the fifth A.

Now, if there are two A's vs one, etc.

But let's hope it is valid.

Another option: ""vodka"" but O, D, K, A -> K excluded? Not.

""vodka"" has V, O, D, K, A. But second letter O, not A.

Not.

So ""pampa"" it is.

<guess>pampa</guess>After reviewing the previous guesses and feedback:
1. **Guess 1: crane**  
   Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
   - A is in the secret word but not in position 3.
   - C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.

2. **Guess 2: salty**  
   Feedback: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)  
   - A is confirmed in position 2.
   - S, L, T, Y are not in the secret word.

3. **Guess 3: haiku**  
   Feedback: H(x) A(✓) I(x) K(x) U(x)  
   - A is again confirmed in position 2 (no change).
   - H, I, K, U are not in the secret word.

### Key deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A _ _ _` (A in position 2).
- **Excluded letters** (all marked 'x' in previous guesses): C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y, H, I, K, U.  
- **Available letters** (not tested or not excluded): B, D, F, G, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
- From the first guess, A was misplaced in position 3, suggesting A may not be in that position (though multiple A's are possible).
- Given the feedback, the word is likely uncommon due to the limited options.

### Approach for the next guess:
- Focus on the pattern `_ A _ _ _` and use only available letters.
- Prioritize common consonants and vowels from the available pool (e.g., B, D, F, G, M, O, P, V) to test new letters efficiently.
- Given the constraints, words with double letters may be unavoidable; ""pampa"" (meaning plains in South America) is a valid 5-letter word fitting:
  - Positions: P (position 1), A (position 2, fixed), M (position 3), P (position 4), A (position 5).
- This guess tests:
  - P in positions 1 and 4.
  - M in position 3.
  - A in position 5 (since position 2 is fixed; we haven't tested A elsewhere yet).
- If the secret word has only one A, position 5 A would be marked 'x' or '-' depending on location.

<guess>pampa</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)
Guess 3: haiku -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) I(x) K(x) U(x)
Guess 4: pampa -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) M(✓) P(x) A(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for four guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
2. ""salty"": S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)
3. ""haiku"": H(x), A(✓), I(x), K(x), U(x)
4. ""pampa"": P(x), A(✓), M(✓), P(x), A(✓)

From the feedback of ""pampa"":
- Position 1: P(x) → P is not in the secret word at all (since both P's got 'x', meaning no P in the word).
- Position 2: A(✓) → A is correct and in position 2 (as before).
- Position 3: M(✓) → M is correct and in position 3.
- Position 4: P(x) → P is not in the word (as above).
- Position 5: A(✓) → A is correct and in position 5.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- A in position 2 and position 5.
- M in position 3.
- No P at all (since both P's are marked 'x').

So the secret word pattern is: _ A M _ A

And letters excluded: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y, H, I, K, U, P.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, O, Q, V, W, X, Z (since A and M are already placed).

Now, the word is of the form: ? A M ? A

We need to fill the first and fourth positions with letters from the available set, excluding the used letters except we know A and M are placed.

The fourth position must be filled, and it must be a letter that, when placed there, forms a word.

Also, note that from first guess ""crane"", we had A in position 3 marked as '-', meaning that A was present but in the wrong position. Now we know that the secret word has A in positions 2 and 5, so that A in position 3 from ""crane"" was likely referring to one of these existing A's? But since position 3 was M, and A wasn't there, it's consistent. There are two A's in the word.

Now, possible words:
First letter: one of B, D, F, G, O, Q, V, W, X, Z
Fourth letter: one of B, D, F, G, O, Q, V, W, X, Z

Common words: ""drama"" but R excluded? R is excluded.

""gamma"" but G? And M in position 3 is correct, but ""gamma"" has M in position 3 and 4? Positions: G, A, M, M, A. But we have the pattern ? A M ? A. For ""gamma"", it would be position 1: G, position 4: M.

But in our feedback from ""pampa"", we also have A(✓) at position 5. In ""gamma"", position 5 is A, so that matches? But the fourth letter? In our pattern, fourth letter is the fourth position.

But in ""gamma"", position 4 is M. But we already have M in position 3? And we haven't tested another M at position 4? But we know from ""pampa"" that position 4 is not P, and we don't know about M elsewhere.

However, we need to guess a word that fits ? A M ? A.

For example, ""gamma"": 
- Position 1: G
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: M
- Position 4: M (but we are to put a letter here? We don't know if M can be here)
- Position 5: A

Similarly, ""dampa""? Not a word.

Another word: ""famba""? Not a word.

""bam"" is three.

Common words: ""cameo"" but C and E excluded? Not.

""watch"" but T and H excluded? Not.

Since we have O available, ""mama"" is four letters.

""jamba""? Not standard.

Perhaps ""lambda"" too long.

I think ""gamma"" is a candidate?

""dadaa"" not a word.

Another: ""wanna"" W, A, N, N, A -> N excluded? Not.

""fanny"" F, A, N, N, Y -> N and Y excluded? Not.

""varna"" V, A, R, N, A -> R and N excluded? Not.

""tappa"" T excluded? Not.

""gamba"" G, A, M, B, A -> but in the pattern, position 3 is M? But ""gamba"" has M in position 3? And A in 2 and 5? Positions: 
1: G
2: A
3: M? ""gamba"" is G,A,M,B,A → so:
Position 1: G
Position 2: A
Position 3: M → correct
Position 4: B
Position 5: A → correct

Oh, ""gamba"" fits the pattern: _ A M _ A → with position 4 as B.

And letters: G, B available? B is in our available list.

Is ""gamba"" a word? Gamba is a musical term for a type of viol or a leg of veal? It might be accepted.

Similarly, ""dalta"" D, A, L, T, A → L and T excluded? Not.

""bomb"" not five.

""gamma"" we have, which is G,A,M,M,A → but it has two M's? And our pattern requires the fourth letter to be M? But we don't have M in the pattern for position 4? No, the pattern is ? A M ? A, so fourth letter can be anything.

In ""gamma"", we would put G in position 1 and M in position 4.

But we already know M is in the word? And we have it in position 3? So M could be elsewhere.

But in ""gamma"", if the secret word were ""gamma"", then position 3 M is correct (as we have), and position 4 M would need to be tested? And position 5 A is correct.

For ""gamba"", we have position 4: B.

So between ""gamma"" and ""gamba"", both are acceptable? But we need to choose one.

Also, ""facia"" F,A,C,I,A → C and I excluded? Not.

""wadia"" W,A,D,I,A → I excluded? Not.

""magma"" M,A,G,M,A? But position 1 M? And we have M in position 3? So it has two M's? But ""magma"" is M,A,G,M,A → so:
Position 1: M
Position 2: A
Position 3: G? But we know position 3 must be M! So it doesn't fit because position 3 is G? Not matching.

We know position 3 is M, so it must be M there.

Therefore, valid words must have M at position 3.

Thus, ""gamma"" has:
1: G
2: A
3: M
4: M → we don't know if this is possible?
5: A

""gamba"" has:
1: G
2: A
3: M
4: B? or is it B? G,A,M,B,A → so position 4: B
5: A

Now, which one? Also, ""delta"" not.

Another word: ""gamp"" is four letters.

Perhaps ""daman"" D,A,M,A,N → N excluded? Not.

""qorma"" Q,O,R,M,A → R excluded? Not.

""oak"" not enough.

I think ""gamma"" and ""gamba"" are candidates.

Given that in ""pampa"" we had P and it was excluded, we can guess. But now, we must guess.

But note: the first position and the fourth position must be filled with available letters.

For ""gamba"": G and B.

For ""gamma"": G and M? But M is already in position 3? So the fourth position being M would imply two M's? But we haven't seen that?

In ""pampa"", we had M at position 3 correct, but no feedback about M elsewhere because we didn't place M elsewhere? In ""pampa"", we placed M at position 3 and it was correct. We placed A at 2 and 5 correct. But we don't know about other M's? So it's possible that there is another M? But unlikely? Or not.

To be safe, we can guess ""gamma"" to check for M? Or ""gamba"" to test B.

But since we have few tries left, we need to be efficient.

Another word: ""dawba"" not standard.

""faxed"" not.

I think ""gamma"" is a more common word? Or perhaps not.

Given that we are at guess 4 and we have 2 tries left? We started with guess 1,2,3,4, now guess 5, then 6 remains.

So we can try one.

To avoid giving away, I think ""gamma"" is a valid word.

But let's see: in ""pampa"", the feedback for position 4 P was x, meaning P is not in the word, but we don't know about other letters.

Similarly, we have no information about G or B.

Perhaps guess ""dam"" something.

Another word: ""vanda"" V,A,N,D,A → N excluded? Not.

So we choose ""gamma"".

Then, if it is not, we try other.

But perhaps ""gamba"" is better because it tests a new letter B.

If we guess ""gamma"", and if position 4 is M, we get M(✓) for position 4? Then position 1 G might be ✓ or not? But we can find out.

Whereas ""gamba"" would have position 4 as B.

But let's estimate likelihood.

Most common words: words with pattern _AMA_A.

In English, words like ""gamma"", ""drama"" (drama with R? excluded), ""gamba"", ""kamba"", ""mamba"", etc.

""Mamba"" M,A,M,B,A → but position 1 M, position 3 M? But we need M at position 3? And position 1? M? And we haven't excluded M? But then ""mamba"" has positions: M,A,M,B,A → so position 1: M, position 2: A, position 3: M, position 4: B, position 5: A.

Position 3 is M? Then it matches? But position 1 is M? And position 3 is M again? So two M's?

But we don't know if that's possible.

Similarly, we have ""gamma"".

And ""gamba"".

Both are reasonable.

But we have ""pampa"" which had M only at position 3 and it was correct, and no other M? But we didn't test.

So for efficiency, I think ""gamba"" is better because it tests a new letter B at position 4, whereas ""gamma"" tests M at position 4 which is redundant if we already know M at position 3 and if there is only one M? But since we placed M at position 4 in ""gamma"", if M is at position 3 already, the extra M would be marked accordingly.

In Wordle, duplicate letters: if there is only one M, then the M at position 3 is correct, so at position 4 it should be absent? Or present? But in this case, secret word has one M, then if we put M at position 3 (correct) and M at position 4, then position 3 would be ✓, and position 4 would be x because there is only one M.

But if there are two M's, position 4 could be ✓ or -.

But to avoid that complexity, choosing ""gamba"" gives us information about B.

I'll choose ""gamba"".

So next guess: ""gamba""

But let's confirm spelling: ""gamba"" is a 5-letter word.

Yes.

Therefore, <guess>gamba</guess>From the feedback of ""pampa"":  
- P is absent (marked 'x' in both positions), so P is not in the secret word.  
- A is correct and in position 2 (marked '✓').  
- M is correct and in position 3 (marked '✓').  
- A is correct and in position 5 (marked '✓').  

Thus, the secret word pattern is: **? A M ? A**, with the confirmed letters A at positions 2 and 5, and M at position 3.  
- Excluded letters (from all previous feedback): C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y, H, I, K, U, P.  
- Available letters for positions 1 and 4: B, D, F, G, O, Q, V, W, X, Z.  

The guess ""gamba"" (G, A, M, B, A) fits this pattern:  
- Position 2 is A (confirmed).  
- Position 3 is M (confirmed).  
- Position 5 is A (confirmed).  
- Positions 1 and 4 test new letters: G and B, both from the available set.  

""Gamba"" is a valid English word (a musical term or short for gamba violin). It tests G in position 1 and B in position 4, prioritizing common consonants to maximize information gain.

But we don\'t know about P, L, S, Y.\n\nAlternatively, ""fault"": F, A, U, L, T. But we don\'t know about F, U, L, T.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N, E.\n\nSo, let\'s try to choose a word that has A and also includes other common letters that we haven\'t tested yet, such as S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\nI think ""staid"" is a good candidate? But let\'s check: S, T, A, I, D. \n- A is in the third position? We want to avoid the third position because in the secret word A is not in the third. But wait, in our first guess we had A in the third and it was misplaced, meaning the secret word has A but not in the third. So in the next guess, we should put A in a different position.\n\nTherefore, we should avoid putting A in the third position again.\n\nSo for ""staid"", A is in the third? That\'s the same as before. We don\'t want that.\n\nHow about ""aisle"": A, I, S, L, E -> but E is out! We cannot use E.\n\nAnother word: ""aloft"": A, L, O, F, T -> A is in the first position. This is good because we haven\'t tested A in the first position.\n\nBut we don\'t know about L, O, F, T.\n\nAlternatively, ""about"": A, B, O, U, T -> A in first. But we don\'t know about B, O, U, T.\n\nBut note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother common word: ""adieu"" but that has E? No, ""adieu"" is A, D, I, E, U -> E is out, so we cannot use.\n\nHow about ""audio"": A, U, D, I, O -> that\'s all vowels? But we know A is present, and we can test U, D, I, O.\n\nBut we might get less information because vowels are less frequent? However, we have to avoid consonants that we haven\'t tested? Actually, we haven\'t tested many consonants.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""piano"": P, I, A, N, O -> but N is out! We know N is absent. So we cannot use N.\n\nWe must avoid N.\n\nSo let me think of words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nHere\'s a list of possible words without C, R, N, E and with A not in the third position:\n\n- Position 1: A, then four other letters (not C, R, N, E). Examples: ""about"", ""above"" (but V and B? and O, U, T), ""adapt"" (but D, A, P, T; but A is in first and third? We don\'t want A in third? Actually, we can have A in multiple positions? But the word must be valid. However, we know the secret word has at least one A, but we don\'t know if it has more. But in ""adapt"", we have two A\'s? But we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s. Also, we are avoiding C, R, N, E, so ""adapt"" is A, D, A, P, T? Wait, that\'s two A\'s. But the word ""adapt"" has A in first and third. We are trying to test A in a new position, but we are also putting it in the third again? We want to avoid the third because we know the secret word\'s A is not in the third? Actually, we don\'t know if there is a second A. But we are only sure about one A. So it\'s okay to put A in the third again? But that might not be efficient because we already know that the A is not in the third. So if we put A in the third again and it shows as absent (x) or correct (✓)? Actually, if we put A in the third and it is the same A we already know, then it should be either misplaced again (if the secret word has only one A and it\'s not in third) or correct (if the secret word has two A\'s and one is in third). But we don\'t know. However, to maximize information, it\'s better to try A in a new position.\n\nSo I think we should avoid the third position for A in this guess.\n\nTherefore, let\'s look for words that have A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nAnother idea: ""salty"": S, A, L, T, Y -> A in second position. This avoids the third. And the letters S, L, T, Y are new.\n\nBut we don\'t know about S, L, T, Y.\n\nAlternatively, ""focal"" but has C and L? C is out, so we cannot use C.\n\nWe must avoid C.\n\nSo ""salty"" seems good: S, A, L, T, Y.\n\nBut we also have the option to test more common letters. The most common consonants in English are T, N, S, H, R, ... but we know N and R are out. So T and S are very common.\n\nTherefore, ""salty"" is a good candidate.\n\nAnother word: ""patio"": P, A, T, I, O -> A in second position. This also tests P, T, I, O.\n\nBut we don\'t know about P, T, I, O.\n\nI think both are good. Let me choose one.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""stamp"" but then A is in the third? We don\'t want that. So avoid.\n\nHow about ""tally"": T, A, L, L, Y -> but has double L? That might not be ideal because we get less information about distinct letters. So better to have all distinct letters.\n\n""Salty"" has distinct letters: S, A, L, T, Y.\n\n""Patio"" has distinct: P, A, T, I, O.\n\nI think ""patio"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (A and I, O) and two common consonants (P, T). But we already know A is present, so we are testing I, O, P, T.\n\nBut ""salty"" has S, A, L, T, Y. S and T are very common.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""salty"" because it has S and T which are high frequency.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N, E. ""salty"" does not contain any of these.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""salty"".\n\nBut wait, we have to consider that the secret word has an A that is not in the third position. In ""salty"", we are putting A in the second position. That\'s a new position.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""salty"".\n\nBut let me double-check: \n- First guess: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)\n- So we know A is present and not in position 3.\n\nNow, with ""salty"":\n- If the A in the second position is correct, we get a ✓ for A.\n- If not, we might get a \'-\' for A (if the secret word has A but not in second) or even an \'x\' (if there is only one A and it\'s not in second, but we know there is at least one A so it would be \'-\' if not in second? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one A and it is in a position that is not second, then we would get \'-\' for A because it is present but misplaced. But if we get an \'x\' for A, that would mean there is no A at all? But we know there is an A, so we should never get an \'x\' for A. Therefore, for A we can only get either ✓ (if it\'s in the second position) or \'-\' (if it\'s in the word but not in second). But note: we are putting A in the second position, and we know the secret word has an A that is not in the third. It could be in the second? We don\'t know.\n\nSo by putting A in the second, we are testing if the A is in the second position.\n\nAlso, we are testing S, L, T, Y.\n\nTherefore, I think ""salty"" is a good guess.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to put A in the first position? For example, ""about"". But we don\'t know about B, O, U, T.\n\nI think ""salty"" is fine.\n\nSo my next guess: ""salty""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").\n- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked as ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Avoid using C, R, N, E.\n- Include A, but not in the third position to test a new location.\n- Choose a word with common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, Y) to maximize information.\n- ""salty"" fits these criteria: A is in the second position, and it tests new letters (S, L, T, Y) while avoiding the excluded letters.\n\n<guess>salty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n1. ""crane"" : C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)\n2. ""salty"" : S(x), A(✓), L(x), T(x), Y(x)\n\nFrom the feedback, we know:\n- The letter \'A\' is in the secret word and in the correct position. From ""salty"", A is in the second position and got a ✓. So the second letter of the secret word is A.\n- From ""salty"": S, L, T, Y are all absent (x). So S, L, T, Y are not in the secret word.\n- From ""crane"": C, R, E are absent (x) and N is also absent. So we know the secret word does not contain C, R, E, N, and now also S, L, T, Y.\n\nTherefore, the set of excluded letters is: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y.\n\nAnd we know that the second letter is A.\n\nSo the secret word pattern is: _ A _ _ _\n\nNow, what letters can be used? We need to avoid the excluded letters: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y.\n\nAlso, we have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, T, Y in our guesses. Note that A is confirmed and placed, so for the other positions, we need new letters.\n\nThe alphabet minus the excluded letters: \nExcluded: C, E, N, R, S, T, L, Y. That\'s 8 letters.\nRemaining letters: A (but already placed), B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nBut A is already used and placed correctly, so for the other positions, we use letters from the remaining set: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nAlso, we know from the first guess that A was misplaced in position 3 (from ""crane""), but now we know the secret word has A in position 2. And since we got a ✓ for A in position 2 in ""salty"", that means the A in position 3 in ""crane"" was not correct and there might be only one A? But wait, it\'s possible that the word has two A\'s? However, in the feedback for ""crane"", we got a \'-\' for A in position 3, meaning it\'s present but not in position 3. But now we have an A in position 2 confirmed. So if the word has only one A, then that A is in position 2, so any other A would get an x? But in ""salty"", we placed A only in position 2, and other positions had other letters. But we didn\'t place A elsewhere.\n\nSo we don\'t know if there are more A\'s. But since the word must have an A and it is in position 2, the \'-\' for A in position 3 from ""crane"" could be because that A is the same one? But no, because if there is only one A, then when we put it in position 3 in ""crane"", it should be \'-\' meaning it exists elsewhere, and now we found it in position 2. So if we put A in position 3 again, it should be x? But we know it\'s not in position 3. So we can avoid having A in other positions? Or test for another A.\n\nBut for now, let\'s assume there might be only one A until proven otherwise.\n\nNow, the secret word is _ A _ _ _\n\nWe need to find a word that fits: \nSecond letter is A.\nDoes not contain: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y (and the other excluded letters).\n\nAlso, we haven\'t tested many letters, so we should choose a word with as many new common letters as possible from the remaining set.\n\nCommon letters from the remaining: vowels I and O, consonants B, D, F, G, H, M, P, etc.\n\nPossible words: we need a word of the form ?A???.\n\nExamples: \n- ""gaudy"" but Y is excluded? Y is in the excluded list. So not.\n- ""happy"" but P? and Y excluded.\n- ""daddy"" but D? and Y excluded and double D? Not great because we want distinct letters to maximize info? But not necessary.\n\nBut we need to avoid the excluded letters.\n\nI think ""bacon"" but C and N are excluded? Not.\n\nAnother: ""fable"" but E is excluded? Not.\n\nPerhaps ""habit"": H, A, B, I, T -> but T is excluded? T is in the excluded list. So no.\n\nExcluded: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y.\n\nSo avoid T.\n\nPossible words: ""manor"" but M, A, N, O, R -> but N and R excluded? R is excluded.\n\nNot.\n\n""papal"" but P, A, P, A, L -> L excluded? L and doubled P and A.\n\nBut L is excluded.\n\nWe need to find a word with second letter A and no C,R,E,N,S,L,T,Y.\n\nLet me try: ""kabob"" but K? and B? but O? Also, it has two B\'s and two O\'s? not efficient.\n\nPerhaps ""radio"" but R excluded? R is excluded.\n\n""magic"" but C excluded.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nAnother: ""haiku"": H, A, I, K, U -> letters: H, I, K, U are not excluded. And A is in second.\n\nSo ""haiku"": \n- H, A, I, K, U\n\nAll letters are allowed: H, A, I, K, U. A is in second.\n\nNow, H, I, K, U are new letters.\n\nThis seems like a valid word.\n\nOther options: \n- ""fairy"" but R and Y excluded? Not.\n- ""giant"" but T excluded? Not.\n- ""bakes"" but S excluded? Not.\n\n""quake"" but E excluded? Not.\n\n""vapid"": V, A, P, I, D -> V, P, I, D are new and not excluded.\n\n""vapid"" is a word.\n\nBut ""haiku"" and ""vapid"" are both options.\n\nAlso, ""habit"" has T excluded? Not.\n\nAnother: ""daisy"" but S and Y excluded? Not.\n\nWe could try ""jacks"" but C and S excluded? Not.\n\nSo ""haiku"" or ""vapid""?\n\nI think ""haiku"" is more common? Or not, but it is a word.\n\nTo test vowels: I and U. Or consonants: H, K.\n\nSimilarly, ""vapid"" has V, P, I, D. V and P are less common.\n\nBut we want to test common letters? But we have few options.\n\nAnother possibility: ""balmy"" but L and Y excluded? Not.\n\n""cabin"" but C and N excluded? Not.\n\n""habit"" is invalid because of T.\n\nHow about ""manic"" but C and N excluded? Not.\n\nPerhaps ""waist"" but S and T excluded? Not.\n\nSo I think ""haiku"" is a reasonable choice.\n\nAlternatively, ""capri"" but C and R excluded? Not.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""haiku"".\n\nTherefore, next guess: ""haiku""\n\nBut note: the secret word has at least one A, and we are putting A in the second position which is correct.\n\nNow, we are testing H, I, K, U in positions 1, 3, 4, 5.\n\nIf any of these are present and in the correct position, we get ✓, or misplaced, we get \'-\'.\n\nThis should give us good information.\n\nBut wait: we know from the first guess that A was in the wrong position at position 3. Now that we have placed A correctly at position 2, so in the first guess, A was at position 3 and was misplaced, meaning the secret word\'s A is not at position 3. Therefore, in ""haiku"", if the secret word has another A? But we are not placing any other A. But in position 3, we are placing I, so that\'s fine. Since we know position 3 cannot have A (because from the first feedback), so we should not put A there anyway.\n\nSo I think ""haiku"" is a good guess.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""haiku"".Based on the previous feedback:\n- From ""crane"": C, R, N, E are not in the secret word, and A is present but not in position 3.\n- From ""salty"": S, L, T, Y are not in the secret word, and A is confirmed in position 2.\n\nThe secret word has the pattern: _ A _ _ _, and excludes the letters C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y. The next guess should prioritize testing new common vowels and consonants from the remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z) to gain maximum information.\n\n""Haiku"" is chosen as the next guess because:\n- It fits the pattern (_ A _ _ _) and avoids excluded letters.\n- It introduces four new untested letters: H, I, K, U.\n- It tests common vowels (I and U) and consonants (H and K) that may reveal positions or presence in the secret word.\n- Since A is already confirmed in position 2, the focus shifts to solving the other positions efficiently.\n\n<guess>haiku</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: haiku -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) I(x) K(x) U(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for three guesses:\n1.

So the secret word does not contain these letters.\n- The only known included letter is A, and it is in position 2.\n\nThe secret word pattern: _ A _ _ _\n\nWe must avoid using any of the excluded letters: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y, H, I, K, U.\n\nAvailable letters are those not excluded: \nAll letters minus the above. \nRemaining: A (but already placed), B, D, F, G, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. \nAnd possibly other vowels? O is available, and consonants.\n\nWe must form a word that has second letter A, and uses only the available letters for the other positions: 1, 3, 4, 5.\n\nAlso, note that from the first guess (""crane""), A was misplaced in position 3. Now that we know A is fixed in position 2, this means there is no other A in the word? Or at least, if there were another A, it might be in a different position? But in ""haiku"", we did not put A in position 3, so we don\'t have information about other positions. However, in the first guess, A was placed in position 3 and got a \'-\', meaning it is present but not in that position. Since we now know A is in position 2, that A in position 3 must be the same one? Meaning there is only one A? Because if there were two A\'s, then in the first guess, position 3 A could have been a different A? But in Wordle, the feedback indicates if a letter is correct or present regardless of duplication? Actually, Wordle handles duplicated letters: if there are two of the same letter, you might get multiple marks. But in this case, the first guess ""crane"" had one A in position 3, and we got a \'-\' meaning it is present but wrong position. Since we now found A in position 2, it implies that A exists exactly once? Not necessarily, but it\'s possible.\n\nHowever, we can\'t assume only one A. We must be cautious.\n\nBut for efficiency, let\'s assume only one A until we have evidence otherwise.\n\nNow, given the available letters: B, D, F, G, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.\n\nWe need a word: letter1 A letter3 letter4 letter5.\n\nPossible words? We must think of words that fit.\n\nExamples:\n- ""gamba"" but has two A\'s? And B. But also M? ""gamba"" is G,A,M,B,A. But if we assume only one A, this might not be good. Also, letters: G, M, B are allowed? But let\'s see: G, A, M, B, A. We have two A\'s. But our pattern requires A in position 2, and then the other letters. If we use ""gamba"", letter4 is B and letter5 is A. But then the word must not have other A\'s? We don\'t know.\n\nPerhaps not.\n\nAnother: ""balsa"" but S excluded? Not.\n\n""papaw"" but P and W? ""papaw"" has two P\'s and two A\'s? P, A, P, A, W.\n\nBut A in position 2 and 4? That might be possible.\n\nBut S and L are excluded? In this word, letters are P, A, P, A, W. P and W are available?

""abaci"" is A,B,A,C,I -> first letter A, not second.\n\nBut we need second letter A.\n\nAnother: ""babul"" B, A, B, U, L -> U and L excluded? Not.\n\n""gadjo"" G, A, D, J, O -> letters G, D, J, O. J is available? We haven\'t excluded J. But is it a word? Gadjo is a word for a non-Roman in Romani culture? Might be obscure.\n\nSimilarly, ""gadge"" E excluded? Not.\n\nPerhaps ""maund""? M, A, U, N, D -> U and N excluded? Not.\n\n"" paul "" P, A, U, L, . -> but three letters?

Not.\n\nI think we might be missing some common words.\n\nLet\'s try ""pawky"" P, A, W, K, Y -> K and Y excluded? Not.\n\nAnother idea: ""dazes"" but S and E? Not.\n\nPerhaps ""dabba"" D, A, B, B, A -> this is not English? But colloquial.\n\nIn standard English, what words are there?\n\n""manor"" M, A, N, O, R -> N and R excluded? Not.\n\n""major"" M, A, J, O, R -> R excluded? Not.\n\nWe need a word like ""bajra""? But not common.\n\nPerhaps ""beige"" E and I? Excluded.\n\nI think we need to consider that the secret word might have two A\'s? But then the positions.\n\nFor example, ""pampa"": P, A, M, P, A.\n\nSecond letter A, and fifth letter A.\n\nBut also P and M available.\n\nBut ""pampa"" is a word (meaning plains in South America).\n\nLetters: P, A, M, P, A. So P and M are the letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""gamma"": G, A, M, M, A.\n\nBut in ""gamma"", letters G, M.\n\nBoth are valid and use available letters.\n\nAnother: ""drama"" but R excluded.\n\nOr ""flamingo"" too long.\n\nSo perhaps ""pampa"" or ""gamma"".\n\nLet\'s choose between them.\n\n""Gamma"" has G and M.\n\n""Pampa"" has P and M.\n\nBoth use M.\n\nTo test more consonants, perhaps ""pampa"" because we could test P.\n\nOr ""gamma"" for G.\n\nBut both have duplicates? In ""pampa"", we have two P\'s and two A\'s.\n\nSimilarly in ""gamma"", two M\'s and two A\'s.\n\nSo if in the secret word, there is only one M or one P, we might not get accurate feedback? But the game handles it: if there is only one P, but we put two, then one might be marked correctly and the other absent? It\'s complicated.\n\nBut for now, since we have limited options, let\'s choose one.\n\nAnother word: ""bacca"" not a word, or ""sagas"" S excluded.\n\nHow about ""kappa""? K, A, P, P, A -> but K is excluded? From ""haiku"", K(x), so K is out.\n\nNot.\n\n""tappa"" T excluded.\n\nSo back to ""pampa"" or ""gamma"".\n\nOr ""bamba""?\n\nBut ""bamba"" might not be common.\n\nPerhaps ""d a o b b"" not a word.\n\nI think ""pampa"" is the best available.\n\nWe can also consider ""mafia"" but F, I, A -> I is excluded? From ""haiku"", I(x), so not.\n\nSimilarly, ""facia"" F, A, C, I, A -> C and I excluded? Not.\n\nSo, I will guess ""pampa"".\n\nTherefore, next guess is ""pampa"".\n\nBut note: the first letter P, the second A (correct), the third M, the fourth P, the fifth A.\n\nNow, if there are two A\'s vs one, etc.\n\nBut let\'s hope it is valid.\n\nAnother option: ""vodka"" but O, D, K, A -> K excluded? Not.\n\n""vodka"" has V, O, D, K, A.

A M ? A\n\nWe need to fill the first and fourth positions with letters from the available set, excluding the used letters except we know A and M are placed.\n\nThe fourth position must be filled, and it must be a letter that, when placed there, forms a word.\n\nAlso, note that from first guess ""crane"", we had A in position 3 marked as \'-\', meaning that A was present but in the wrong position. Now we know that the secret word has A in positions 2 and 5, so that A in position 3 from ""crane"" was likely referring to one of these existing A\'s? But since position 3 was M, and A wasn\'t there, it\'s consistent. There are two A\'s in the word.\n\nNow, possible words:\nFirst letter: one of B, D, F, G, O, Q, V, W, X, Z\nFourth letter: one of B, D, F, G, O, Q, V, W, X, Z\n\nCommon words: ""drama"" but R excluded?

For ""gamma"", it would be position 1: G, position 4: M.\n\nBut in our feedback from ""pampa"", we also have A(✓) at position 5. In ""gamma"", position 5 is A, so that matches? But the fourth letter? In our pattern, fourth letter is the fourth position.\n\nBut in ""gamma"", position 4 is M. But we already have M in position 3? And we haven\'t tested another M at position 4? But we know from ""pampa"" that position 4 is not P, and we don\'t know about M elsewhere.\n\nHowever, we need to guess a word that fits ? A M ? A.\n\nFor example, ""gamma"": \n- Position 1: G\n- Position 2: A\n- Position 3: M\n- Position 4: M (but we are to put a letter here? We don\'t know if M can be here)\n- Position 5: A\n\nSimilarly, ""dampa""? Not a word.\n\nAnother word: ""famba""? Not a word.\n\n""bam"" is three.\n\nCommon words: ""cameo"" but C and E excluded? Not.\n\n""watch"" but T and H excluded? Not.\n\nSince we have O available, ""mama"" is four letters.\n\n""jamba""? Not standard.\n\nPerhaps ""lambda"" too long.\n\nI think ""gamma"" is a candidate?\n\n""dadaa"" not a word.\n\nAnother: ""wanna"" W, A, N, N, A -> N excluded?

Not.\n\n""gamba"" G, A, M, B, A -> but in the pattern, position 3 is M? But ""gamba"" has M in position 3? And A in 2 and 5? Positions: \n1: G\n2: A\n3: M? ""gamba"" is G,A,M,B,A → so:\nPosition 1: G\nPosition 2: A\nPosition 3: M → correct\nPosition 4: B\nPosition 5: A → correct\n\nOh, ""gamba"" fits the pattern: _ A M _ A → with position 4 as B.\n\nAnd letters: G, B available? B is in our available list.\n\nIs ""gamba"" a word? Gamba is a musical term for a type of viol or a leg of veal? It might be accepted.\n\nSimilarly, ""dalta"" D, A, L, T, A → L and T excluded? Not.\n\n""bomb"" not five.\n\n""gamma"" we have, which is G,A,M,M,A → but it has two M\'s? And our pattern requires the fourth letter to be M? But we don\'t have M in the pattern for position 4? No, the pattern is ? A M ? A, so fourth letter can be anything.\n\nIn ""gamma"", we would put G in position 1 and M in position 4.\n\nBut we already know M is in the word? And we have it in position 3? So M could be elsewhere.\n\nBut in ""gamma"", if the secret word were ""gamma"", then position 3 M is correct (as we have), and position 4 M would need to be tested? And position 5 A is correct.\n\nFor ""gamba"", we have position 4: B.\n\nSo between ""gamma"" and ""gamba"", both are acceptable? But we need to choose one.\n\nAlso, ""facia"" F,A,C,I,A → C and I excluded? Not.\n\n""wadia"" W,A,D,I,A → I excluded? Not.\n\n""magma"" M,A,G,M,A? But position 1 M? And we have M in position 3? So it has two M\'s? But ""magma"" is M,A,G,M,A → so:\nPosition 1: M\nPosition 2: A\nPosition 3: G? But we know position 3 must be M! So it doesn\'t fit because position 3 is G? Not matching.\n\nWe know position 3 is M, so it must be M there.\n\nTherefore, valid words must have M at position 3.\n\nThus, ""gamma"" has:\n1: G\n2: A\n3: M\n4: M → we don\'t know if this is possible?\n5: A\n\n""gamba"" has:\n1: G\n2: A\n3: M\n4: B? or is it B? G,A,M,B,A → so position 4: B\n5: A\n\nNow, which one? Also, ""delta"" not.\n\nAnother word: ""gamp"" is four letters.\n\nPerhaps ""daman"" D,A,M,A,N → N excluded? Not.\n\n""qorma"" Q,O,R,M,A → R excluded? Not.\n\n""oak"" not enough.\n\nI think ""gamma"" and ""gamba"" are candidates.\n\nGiven that in ""pampa"" we had P and it was excluded, we can guess. But now, we must guess.\n\nBut note: the first position and the fourth position must be filled with available letters.\n\nFor ""gamba"": G and B.\n\nFor ""gamma"": G and M? But M is already in position 3? So the fourth position being M would imply two M\'s? But we haven\'t seen that?\n\nIn ""pampa"", we had M at position 3 correct, but no feedback about M elsewhere because we didn\'t place M elsewhere? In ""pampa"", we placed M at position 3 and it was correct. We placed A at 2 and 5 correct. But we don\'t know about other M\'s? So it\'s possible that there is another M? But unlikely? Or not.\n\nTo be safe, we can guess ""gamma"" to check for M? Or ""gamba"" to test B.\n\nBut since we have few tries left, we need to be efficient.\n\nAnother word: ""dawba"" not standard.\n\n""faxed"" not.\n\nI think ""gamma"" is a more common word? Or perhaps not.\n\nGiven that we are at guess 4 and we have 2 tries left? We started with guess 1,2,3,4, now guess 5, then 6 remains.\n\nSo we can try one.\n\nTo avoid giving away, I think ""gamma"" is a valid word.\n\nBut let\'s see: in ""pampa"", the feedback for position 4 P was x, meaning P is not in the word, but we don\'t know about other letters.\n\nSimilarly, we have no information about G or B.\n\nPerhaps guess ""dam"" something.\n\nAnother word: ""vanda"" V,A,N,D,A → N excluded? Not.\n\nSo we choose ""gamma"".\n\nThen, if it is not, we try other.\n\nBut perhaps ""gamba"" is better because it tests a new letter B.\n\nIf we guess ""gamma"", and if position 4 is M, we get M(✓) for position 4? Then position 1 G might be ✓ or not? But we can find out.\n\nWhereas ""gamba"" would have position 4 as B.\n\nBut let\'s estimate likelihood.\n\nMost common words: words with pattern _AMA_A.\n\nIn English, words like ""gamma"", ""drama"" (drama with R? excluded), ""gamba"", ""kamba"", ""mamba"", etc.\n\n""Mamba"" M,A,M,B,A → but position 1 M, position 3 M? But we need M at position 3? And position 1? M? And we haven\'t excluded M? But then ""mamba"" has positions: M,A,M,B,A → so position 1: M, position 2: A, position 3: M, position 4: B, position 5: A.\n\nPosition 3 is M? Then it matches? But position 1 is M? And position 3 is M again? So two M\'s?\n\nBut we don\'t know if that\'s possible.\n\nSimilarly, we have ""gamma"".\n\nAnd ""gamba"".\n\nBoth are reasonable.\n\nBut we have ""pampa"" which had M only at position 3 and it was correct, and no other M? But we didn\'t test.\n\nSo for efficiency, I think ""gamba"" is better because it tests a new letter B at position 4, whereas ""gamma"" tests M at position 4 which is redundant if we already know M at position 3 and if there is only one M? But since we placed M at position 4 in ""gamma"", if M is at position 3 already, the extra M would be marked accordingly.\n\nIn Wordle, duplicate letters: if there is only one M, then the M at position 3 is correct, so at position 4 it should be absent? Or present? But in this case, secret word has one M, then if we put M at position 3 (correct) and M at position 4, then position 3 would be ✓, and position 4 would be x because there is only one M.\n\nBut if there are two M\'s, position 4 could be ✓ or -.\n\nBut to avoid that complexity, choosing ""gamba"" gives us information about B.\n\nI\'ll choose ""gamba"".\n\nSo next guess: ""gamba""\n\nBut let\'s confirm spelling: ""gamba"" is a 5-letter word.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, <guess>gamba</guess>From the feedback of ""pampa"":  \n- P is absent (marked \'x\' in both positions), so P is not in the secret word.  \n- A is correct and in position 2 (marked \'✓\').  \n- M is correct and in position 3 (marked \'✓\').  \n- A is correct and in position 5 (marked \'✓\').  \n\nThus, the secret word pattern is: **?

It tests G in position 1 and B in position 4, prioritizing common consonants to maximize information gain.\n\n<guess>gamba</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: haiku -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) I(x) K(x) U(x)\nGuess 4: pampa -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) M(✓) P(x) A(✓)\nGuess 5: gamba -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) A(✓) M(✓) B(x) A(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the fifth guess: ""gamba"" -> G(✓) A(✓) M(✓) B(x) A(✓)
This indicates:
- G is correct and in position 1 (since it's marked ✓ for position 1).
- A is correct in position 2 (already known).
- M is correct in position 3 (already known).
- B is absent (x) from the word. So B is not in the secret word at all.
- A is correct in position 5 (already known).

Therefore, the secret word is G A M ? A, and from previous feedback, we know:
- The fourth letter is missing and must be filled.
- Excluded letters: C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y, H, I, K, U, P, B (from ""gamba"" feedback: B(x)).
- We also know that the fourth position was B and it was absent, so the fourth letter is not B and is one of the remaining available letters.

Available letters: D, F, O, Q, V, W, X, Z (since G, A, M are used and confirmed).

We must choose a letter for the fourth position from {D, F, O, Q, V, W, X, Z} to complete ""G A M ? A"".

Now, what five-letter words start with ""GAM"" and end with ""A""? With the fourth letter being from the above set.

Possible words:
- Gamma: But we tried ""gamma"" in mind, but note that in ""gamma"", the fourth letter is M. But we already have M at position 3? And we haven't used M again? But in the available letters M is not listed because it is already placed? But we can use it? However, if we use a word with two M's, the secret word ""gamma"" would be pattern: G,A,M,M,A. Then position 3: M is correct. Position 4: M? We haven't tested M at position 4.

But in the feedback of ""pampa"", we placed M at position 3 (which was correct) and P at position 4 (absent). We did not place M at position 4, so we don't know if M is present elsewhere? But from the pattern, if the secret word is ""gamma"", then position 4 is M. So it should be tested.

But note: from ""gamba"", we placed B at position 4 and it was absent (Bx), so position 4 is not B.

Similarly, we know that position 4 is not among the excluded letters.

But ""gamma"" has the fourth letter as M. So we must try it? Or perhaps there are other words.

Other words:
- ""gamey"" but E and Y excluded? Not.
- ""gamer"" E and R excluded? Not.
- ""gamed"" E and D? D is available? ""gamed"" is G,A,M,E,D -> E excluded? Not.
- ""gamin"" I and N excluded? Not.
- ""gamma"" as above: G,A,M,M,A -> with fourth letter M.

But is there any other? For example, ""gamba"" itself is excluded because B is absent.

Another possibility: ""gaura""? G,A,U,R,A -> U and R excluded? Not.

""gavia"" G,A,V,I,A -> I excluded? Not.

""galea"" G,A,L,E,A -> L and E excluded? Not.

""gama"" is four letters.

""gandy"" G,A,N,D,Y -> N and Y excluded? Not.

""garza"" R and Z? R excluded? Not.

I think the only standard word left is ""gamma"".

Therefore, we should guess ""gamma"".

So the word is G A M M A.

Then, if correct, we get all ✓.

Let me confirm: ""gamma"" is indeed a word.

Therefore, next guess: ""gamma""

After analyzing the feedback from all previous guesses, the following conclusions are drawn:

### Feedback Summary:
1. **crane**: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
   - **A** is in the word but not in position 3.
2. **salty**: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)  
   - **A** is correct in position 2.
3. **haiku**: H(x) A(✓) I(x) K(x) U(x)  
   - Confirms **A** in position 2; H, I, K, U excluded.
4. **pampa**: P(x) A(✓) M(✓) P(x) A(✓)  
   - **M** is correct in position 3; **A** is correct in position 5; **P** excluded.
5. **gamba**: G(✓) A(✓) M(✓) B(x) A(✓)  
   - **G** is correct in position 1; **B** excluded; positions 2 (A), 3 (M), and 5 (A) confirmed.

### Deductions:
- The secret word pattern is **G A M ? A** (positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 are confirmed as G, A, M, A).
- Position 4 is unknown and must be filled with a letter **not excluded**.
- **Excluded letters** (all marked 'x' across guesses): C, R, E, N, S, L, T, Y, H, I, K, U, P, B.  
- **Available letters** for position 4: D, F, O, Q, V, W, X, Z.
- Words matching **G A M ? A** are limited. After testing common options like ""gamma"" and ""gamba"" in mind:
  - ""gamma"" (G, A, M, M, A) is a valid 5-letter word using only available letters and fits the pattern. It is consistent with all feedback.  
  - All other tested combinations (e.g., ""gamba"") fail due to excluded letters or pattern mismatch.

Given the pattern and available letters, **gamma** is the only plausible word left. This guess efficiently resolves the uncertainty for position 4 by testing **M** (a known existing letter in position 3) for duplication, leveraging Wordle's handling of repeated letters.

### Thought Process:
<thought>
- Position 1: G (confirmed ✓).  
- Position 2: A (confirmed ✓).  
- Position 3: M (confirmed ✓).  
- Position 4: Unknown; must be a letter from the available pool.  
- Position 5: A (confirmed ✓).  
- ""gamma"" tests position 4 specifically: if M is duplicated and correct, it returns ✓; if misplaced, it returns -; if absent, it returns x.  
- All feedback rules are satisfied:  
- No excluded letters used.  
- Position 3 M remains valid even if duplicated.  
- If incorrect, position 4 must be D, F, O, Q, V, W, X, or Z—but ""gamma"" is the most probable fit.
