We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter 'N' is in the secret word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""crane"" it was at the 4th and got a '-' meaning present but wrong spot).
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'N' and does not contain C, R, A, E.

 Since 'N' is in the word but not in the 4th position, it must be in one of the first three positions or the last position? Actually, positions: 1,2,3,5 (because in a 5-letter word, the positions are 1 to 5).

 However, note that the feedback for 'N' was at position 4, so it can be in position 1,2,3, or 5.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
 - Does not contain C, R, A, E (since they are not in the word).
 - Contains the letter 'N' (but not in the 4th position? Actually, we can put it in a different position to test).
 - We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that are left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We know the word has an 'N'. We can try to use a word that has 'N' in a different position and also includes other common consonants and vowels.

 Since we don't have any vowels confirmed (A and E are out, but we have other vowels: I, O, U) we might want to test a vowel.

 However, note that the word must have at least one vowel. The vowels we haven't tested are: I, O, U (and sometimes Y).

 Let's try to pick a word that:
 - Has the letter 'N' in a position that is not 4 (so we can test other positions).
 - Uses other common letters that we haven't eliminated.

 We also note that we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, A, E) and know one letter (N) is present.

 Possible strategy: use a word with 'N' in the first position? Or in the second? And include other common letters.

 Let me list some common consonants: S, T, L, M, D, etc.

 We can try a word like ""NOISY"" but note that we have 5 letters and we must avoid A, E, R, C.

 However, we must also avoid the letters that are not in the word. So we cannot use C, R, A, E.

 Let me think of words that have 'N' and do not have C, R, A, E.

 Some options:
 - ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but note that in ""crane"", N was at position 4 and now we put N at position 4 again? We know N is not at position 4, so we should avoid putting N at position 4. In ""POINT"", N is at position 4? Actually, P-O-I-N-T: N is at position 4. So we don't want that because we already know N is not at position 4.

 - ""UNITY"": U, N, I, T, Y -> N is at position 2. This avoids position 4. Also, no C, R, A, E.

 - ""MINTS"": M, I, N, T, S -> N is at position 3. Also, no C, R, A, E.

 - ""SONIC"": but C is eliminated, so not allowed.

 - ""LINKS"": L, I, N, K, S -> N is at position 3. No C, R, A, E.

 But note: we don't know if the word has S, T, L, etc. So we are testing.

 However, we must be cautious: we have only 6 tries.

 Another idea: we can try to use a word that has two N's? But that might be less common.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has the letter 'N' and also tests other vowels (like O, I, U) and common consonants.

 Let me choose ""UNITY"": 
 - U (vowel we haven't tested), N (we know is present, but at position 2), I (vowel), T (common consonant), Y (sometimes vowel).

 But note: the feedback for the first word told us that N is present but not at position 4. In ""UNITY"", we put N at position 2. If the secret word has N at position 2, we'll get a check. If not, we might get a dash or if it's not in the word at all? But we know it is in the word, so we'll get either a check (if at position 2) or a dash (if at another position).

 However, we know the word has one N? Actually, it could have two. But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in a position we haven't tested, such as position 1 or 5.

 Example: ""NIGHT"": N, I, G, H, T -> N at position 1. But note: we don't know if the word has I, G, H, T.

 But we are trying to get information.

 Another candidate: ""SNOWY"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N at position 2. But we don't know if S is in the word.

 However, we have to test.

 Considering the above, I think ""UNITY"" is a reasonable guess because:
 - It uses the known letter N (at position 2, which is a new position).
 - It tests the vowels U and I, and the consonant T and Y.

 But note: we must avoid the letters C, R, A, E.

 ""UNITY"" does not contain any of these.

 So, I will go with ""UNITY"".

 However, let me check if ""UNITY"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

 Therefore, second guess: ""UNITY""

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- N is in the word but **not in the 4th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Avoid C, R, A, E entirely.
- Include N in a position other than 4 (e.g., position 2) to test its location.
- Test new common letters (like U, I, T, Y) to gather more information.

""UNITY"" fits these criteria:
- Contains N at position 2 (new position to test).
- Uses untested vowels (U, I) and consonants (T, Y).
- Excludes invalid letters (C, R, A, E).

Actually, positions: 1,2,3,5 (because in a 5-letter word, the positions are 1 to 5).\n\n However, note that the feedback for \'N\' was at position 4, so it can be in position 1,2,3, or 5.\n\n Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:\n - Does not contain C, R, A, E (since they are not in the word).\n - Contains the letter \'N\' (but not in the 4th position?

We can try to use a word that has \'N\' in a different position and also includes other common consonants and vowels.\n\n Since we don\'t have any vowels confirmed (A and E are out, but we have other vowels: I, O, U) we might want to test a vowel.\n\n However, note that the word must have at least one vowel. The vowels we haven\'t tested are: I, O, U (and sometimes Y).\n\n Let\'s try to pick a word that:\n - Has the letter \'N\' in a position that is not 4 (so we can test other positions).\n - Uses other common letters that we haven\'t eliminated.\n\n We also note that we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, A, E) and know one letter (N) is present.\n\n Possible strategy: use a word with \'N\' in the first position?

We know N is not at position 4, so we should avoid putting N at position 4. In ""POINT"", N is at position 4? Actually, P-O-I-N-T: N is at position 4. So we don\'t want that because we already know N is not at position 4.\n\n - ""UNITY"": U, N, I, T, Y -> N is at position 2. This avoids position 4.

Also, no C, R, A, E.\n\n - ""SONIC"": but C is eliminated, so not allowed.\n\n - ""LINKS"": L, I, N, K, S -> N is at position 3. No C, R, A, E.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has S, T, L, etc. So we are testing.\n\n However, we must be cautious: we have only 6 tries.\n\n Another idea: we can try to use a word that has two N\'s?

In ""UNITY"", we put N at position 2. If the secret word has N at position 2, we\'ll get a check. If not, we might get a dash or if it\'s not in the word at all? But we know it is in the word, so we\'ll get either a check (if at position 2) or a dash (if at another position).\n\n However, we know the word has one N? Actually, it could have two.

But we don\'t know if S is in the word.\n\n However, we have to test.\n\n Considering the above, I think ""UNITY"" is a reasonable guess because:\n - It uses the known letter N (at position 2, which is a new position).\n - It tests the vowels U and I, and the consonant T and Y.\n\n But note: we must avoid the letters C, R, A, E.\n\n ""UNITY"" does not contain any of these.\n\n So, I will go with ""UNITY"".\n\n However, let me check if ""UNITY"" is a valid word: yes, it is.\n\n Therefore, second guess: ""UNITY""\n\n Format: <guess>unity</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- N is in the word but **not in the 4th position** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Avoid C, R, A, E entirely.\n- Include N in a position other than 4 (e.g., position 2) to test its location.\n- Test new common letters (like U, I, T, Y) to gather more information.\n\n""UNITY"" fits these criteria:\n- Contains N at position 2 (new position to test).\n- Uses untested vowels (U, I) and consonants (T, Y).\n- Excludes invalid letters (C, R, A, E).\n\n<guess>unity</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: unity -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(-) I(x) T(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Meaning:
  - C, R, A, E are not in the word.
  - N is in the word but not in the 4th position.

Guess 2: ""unity"" -> U(-), N(-), I(x), T(✓), Y(✓)
Meaning:
  - U is in the word but not in the 1st position.
  - N is in the word but not in the 2nd position (and we already knew it's not in the 4th from the first guess).
  - I is not in the word.
  - T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4? Let's check: ""unity"" is U-N-I-T-Y, so T is at position 4). So T is at position 4 and correct.
  - Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5). So Y is at position 5 and correct.

So from guess 2, we know:
  - The secret word has T at position 4 and Y at position 5. So the word ends with ""TY"".
  - U is in the word but not at position 1.
  - N is in the word but not at position 2 (and not at position 4, which we already knew).
  - I is not in the word.

Also, from guess 1, we know that the word does not contain C, R, A, E, and now also I is not in the word.

So the known correct positions:
  - Position 4: T
  - Position 5: Y

So the word is _ _ _ T Y.

We also know the word contains U and N, but we don't know their positions. They cannot be in positions that are already taken or where we know they are not.

Positions available: 1, 2, 3.

We know:
  - U cannot be at position 1 (from ""unity"" feedback: U is present but not at position 1).
  - N cannot be at position 2 (from ""unity"") and also not at position 4 (from ""crane"", but position 4 is now taken by T, so that's fine).

Therefore, for U and N, they must be in positions 1, 2, or 3, but with restrictions:
  - U cannot be in position 1 -> so U must be in position 2 or 3.
  - N cannot be in position 2 -> so N must be in position 1 or 3.

But note: we have two letters (U and N) to place in three positions (1,2,3) and one of these positions will be a new letter.

Also, we know the word has exactly these two letters (U and N) plus the T and Y, and one more letter that we haven't found yet? Actually, we know the word has U and N, and we have T and Y, so that's four letters. The fifth letter is missing and must be one that we haven't eliminated.

Eliminated letters so far: C, R, A, E, I (and also from the feedback, we know which are absent). Also, we have used U, N, T, Y, and we know they are in the word (except that I is not, but we already excluded I).

We must avoid: C, R, A, E, I.

We know the word has: U, N, T, Y.

And one more letter that we don't know yet.

So the word is: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] T Y

Where:
  - letter1, letter2, letter3 are to be filled with U, N, and one new letter (let's call it X), but note that U and N are already in the word, so they must appear exactly once? Or could they appear multiple times? We don't know, but so far we have only seen one of each.

But from the feedback, we know that U and N are present, but we don't know if they appear more than once. However, we have only seen one occurrence of each.

Given that, we can assume for now that they appear once, but we must be cautious.

Now, the constraints for U and N:
  - U cannot be in position 1 -> so U must be in position 2 or 3.
  - N cannot be in position 2 -> so N must be in position 1 or 3.

But note: if both U and N are in position 3, that's impossible. So the possibilities for positions 1,2,3:

Option 1: N at position 1, U at position 2, and then a new letter at position 3.
Option 2: N at position 1, U at position 3, and a new letter at position 2.
Option 3: U at position 2, N at position 3, and a new letter at position 1.
Option 4: U at position 3, N at position 1, and a new letter at position 2. (same as option 2? Actually, option 2 and 4 are the same: N at 1, U at 3, and new at 2)
Option 5: But we cannot have N at position 2 or U at position 1, so the above are the only possibilities.

Actually, let me list:

Position 1: can be N or the new letter (but not U).
Position 2: can be U or the new letter (but not N).
Position 3: can be U, N, or the new letter.

But note: if position 1 is N, then position 2 can be U or the new letter, and position 3 would be the remaining.
Similarly, if position 1 is the new letter, then position 2 must be U (because it can't be N and we have to place U) and then position 3 must be N? Or if position 2 is the new letter, then position 3 must be either U or N? Actually, we have to assign both U and N.

So the possibilities:

Case A: N at 1, then:
   - U at 2: then new letter at 3 -> word: N U ? T Y
   - U at 3: then new letter at 2 -> word: N ? U T Y

Case B: U at 2, then:
   - N at 1: that's the same as above (N at 1, U at 2) -> word: N U ? T Y
   - N at 3: then new letter at 1 -> word: ? U N T Y

Case C: U at 3, then:
   - N at 1: then new letter at 2 -> word: N ? U T Y
   - N cannot be at 2, so if U is at 3, then N must be at 1? Because if N is at 1, then we have the case above.

Actually, the distinct cases are:

1. N at 1, U at 2, and new letter at 3: ""NU?TY""
2. N at 1, U at 3, and new letter at 2: ""N?UTY""
3. U at 2, N at 3, and new letter at 1: ""?UNTY""

We don't have a case with U at 3 and N at 1? That's the same as case 2.

So three distinct patterns.

Now, we need to find a word that fits one of these patterns and uses a new letter that is not eliminated.

Eliminated letters: C, R, A, E, I.

We also have to consider that the new letter must be a letter that hasn't been used and is not eliminated.

We can try to guess a word that tests these possibilities.

But note: we have T and Y fixed at the end, and we know U and N are present. We need to find the new letter and the positions of U and N.

We can try to use a word that has the pattern of one of these and uses a common letter for the unknown.

But we have three cases. We might be able to cover two cases with one guess? Or we can choose a word that tests the position of U and N and also tests a new letter.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has the known T and Y at the end, and then for the first three positions, we try to include U and N and a new letter, but in a way that we can distinguish the cases.

But note: we have only three positions to assign and we have two known letters (U and N) and one unknown.

We can try to guess a word that has the form:

Option: ""NUTTY"" -> but that has two T's? We don't know if T appears twice. But we know T is at position 4, so if we put T at position 3, that would be a different T. But the feedback for T in ""unity"" was only for position 4. We don't know if there is another T.

But we can try. However, ""NUTTY"" has two T's. Let me see: N U T T Y. But we have T at position 3 and 4. We don't know if the word has two T's.

But we can consider it. However, we are limited by the eliminated letters.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that uses common letters that are not eliminated.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Z (and Y and T are already in, but we are using them at the end).

We can try to form words for the patterns:

Pattern 1: ""NU?TY"" -> e.g., N U * T Y. What words? 
  - NUTTY? But that would be N U T T Y -> but then the third letter is T, which we already have at position 4. But that's allowed if the word has two T's. But we don't know.

Pattern 2: ""N?UTY"" -> e.g., N * U T Y. Words: 
  - NETTY? But E is eliminated.
  - NATTY? But A is eliminated.
  - NOTTY? Not a word.
  - NITTY? But I is eliminated.
  - So maybe ""NUTTY"" is the only common one? But that's pattern 1.

Pattern 3: ""?UNTY"" -> * U N T Y. Words:
  - BUNTY? Not common.
  - DUNTY? Not a word.
  - HUNTY? Not a word.
  - LUNTY? Not a word.
  - MUNTY? Not a word.
  - PUNTY? Not a word.
  - SUNTY? Not a word.
  - Actually, common word: ""PUNTY"" is not standard. But ""BUNTY"" isn't either.

Wait, what about ""PUNNY""? But that has two N's and ends with NY, not TY.

We need to end with TY.

Another idea: ""COUNTY"" -> but that has C and O? C is eliminated, and O is new. But C is eliminated, so we can't use C.

""MOUNTY"" -> M O U N T Y -> but that's 6 letters? No, 5: M O U N T -> but then we have T at position 5? No, ""MOUNT"" is 5 letters? M-O-U-N-T, so T is at position 5, but we need T at position 4 and Y at 5. So that doesn't fit.

We have to have T at 4 and Y at 5. So the word must end with ""TY"".

So the last two letters are fixed.

Now, let's think of words ending with ""TY"" that have U and N and one more letter, and avoid C,R,A,E,I.

Common words ending with ""TY"": 
  - PARTY: but has A and R, eliminated.
  - DIRTY: has I and D? I is eliminated.
  - DUTY: D U T Y -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5. So no.
  - We need 5-letter words.

5-letter words ending with ""TY"":
  - PARTY (eliminated)
  - DIRTY (eliminated)
  - DUTY is 4 letters.
  - TESTY: T E S T Y -> but E is eliminated.
  - NINETY: 6 letters.
  - MISTY: M I S T Y -> I is eliminated.
  - MUSTY: M U S T Y -> this is 5 letters: M-U-S-T-Y. But note: we have T at position 4? In ""MUSTY"": positions: 1:M, 2:U, 3:S, 4:T, 5:Y -> so that fits the pattern: _ _ _ T Y.

But does it have an N? We know the word must have an N. ""MUSTY"" has M, U, S, T, Y. It does not have N. So that cannot be.

Similarly, ""RUSTY"": R and U, S, T, Y -> R is eliminated.

""GUSTY"": G U S T Y -> no N.

""DUSTY"": D U S T Y -> no N.

""HASTY"": H A S T Y -> A eliminated.

""NASTY"": N A S T Y -> A eliminated.

""PASTY"": P A S T Y -> A eliminated.

""TASTY"": T A S T Y -> A eliminated and also two T's? But A is eliminated.

We need a word that has N and U and ends with TY.

Let me search for words: 
  - NUTTY: N U T T Y -> positions: 1:N, 2:U, 3:T, 4:T, 5:Y -> but we have T at position 3 and 4. We know T is at position 4, but we don't know about position 3. Also, it has two T's. And it has U at position 2 and N at position 1.

This fits pattern 1: ""NUTTY""

But is ""NUTTY"" a word? Yes, meaning nutlike or containing nuts.

Now, does it avoid eliminated letters? It has N, U, T, T, Y. Eliminated letters are C,R,A,E,I. So yes.

But we have two T's. We don't know if the secret word has two T's. But it's possible.

Another word: ""BUNTY""? Not a word.

""PUNTY"" is not a common word, but in glassblowing? Not common.

""LUNTY""? Not a word.

""COUNTY"" has C, eliminated.

""MOUNTY"" is not 5 letters? ""MOUNTY"" isn't standard. The word is ""mount"" but that's 5 letters without Y? We need the Y at the end.

Another idea: ""AUNTY"" -> but A is eliminated.

So ""NUTTY"" seems a candidate.

But let's see pattern 2: ""N?UTY"", meaning N at 1, then a letter, then U, then T, then Y. So ""N?UTY"". What words?
  - NATUY? Not a word.
  - NETUY? Not a word.
  - NITUY? Not a word.
  - NOTUY? Not a word.
  - NUTUY? Not a word.

I can't think of any common word for pattern 2.

Pattern 3: ""?UNTY"", meaning a letter, then U, then N, then T, then Y. So words like ""BUNTY"", ""DUNTY"", etc. but not common. However, ""PUNTY"" is not common. But there is ""BUNNY"" but that ends with NY.

Wait, what about ""FUNKY""? But that ends with KY.

Another word: ""JUNKY"" but ends with KY.

We need TY.

Perhaps ""HUNTY"" is not a word. But ""HUNTS"" is without Y.

So the only common word that fits the pattern and has U, N, and ends with TY is ""NUTTY"".

But let me double-check: is there a word like ""DUTY"" with 5 letters? No.

""BEAUTY"" is 5 letters? B-E-A-U-T-Y -> 6 letters.

So ""NUTTY"" seems the only common word.

But we have feedback that in ""unity"", U was present but not at position 1, and in ""NUTTY"", U is at position 2. That is allowed.

Also, N is at position 1, and we had no feedback that N cannot be at position 1. In fact, we only know it's not at 2 or 4.

So ""NUTTY"" is a valid candidate.

But note: in ""NUTTY"", the third letter is T. We already know that T is at position 4. If the secret word has two T's, then it's okay. If not, then the T at position 3 would be incorrect.

But we don't know if there is a T at position 3.

Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that doesn't assume two T's and tests the other possibilities.

But we don't have many options.

We can try to guess a word that has the pattern of case 3: ""?UNTY"", but with a letter that is common and not eliminated.

For example, what if we try ""HUNTY""? But it's not a word. ""PUNTY"" is not a word.

""COUNTY"" has C.

""MOUNT"" is 5 letters but without Y? We need the Y at the end.

Another idea: ""MINTY"" -> M I N T Y -> but I is eliminated.

""TUNNY"" -> T U N N Y -> but that ends with NY, not TY.

We must have T at 4 and Y at 5.

So I think ""NUTTY"" is the best guess.

But let's consider: we have three cases, and we can design a guess that helps distinguish.

We can try to use a word that has U in position 3 and N in position 1, for example, and a new letter. But we don't have a common word for that.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has the new letter and tests the presence of other common letters.

But we know the word has U and N, so we must include them.

We can try ""POUND"" but that doesn't end with TY.

We have to keep T and Y fixed at the end.

So the guess must end with ""TY"".

Therefore, I think we should guess ""NUTTY"".

But let me see if there is another word for pattern 3.

What about ""DAUNT""? But that ends with T, not TY, and has A.

No.

So I'll go with ""NUTTY"".

But note: in ""NUTTY"", the letter T appears at position 3 and 4. We don't know if the secret word has two T's. But if it doesn't, then the T at position 3 would be marked as absent or wrong position? 

In the feedback, if the secret word has only one T (at position 4), then in ""NUTTY"", the T at position 3 would be marked as absent (x) because the T at position 4 is already accounted for? Or if the secret word has one T, then the first T (position 3) might be marked as present but wrong position? But then it would be moved to the correct position? 

Actually, the rules: if there is only one T in the secret word, and you have two T's in the guess, then one of them will be marked correctly (if in the right position) and the other as absent. Since in ""NUTTY"", the T at position 4 is correct, then the T at position 3 would be marked as absent (x) because there is no extra T in the word.

But we don't know if the word has one or two T's.

So by guessing ""NUTTY"", we can get information.

Alternatively, we can try to avoid the double T and guess a word that has a different letter at position 3.

But what word? For example, ""NURTY"" is not a word.

""NUFTY""? Not a word.

""NUMTY""? Not a word.

So I think ""NUTTY"" is acceptable.

Therefore, I will guess ""NUTTY"".

But let me check the pattern: in ""NUTTY"", we have:
  - Position 1: N -> we don't know if N is at position 1? But we know N is in the word and not at 2 or 4, so it could be at 1.
  - Position 2: U -> we know U is in the word and not at 1, so position 2 is possible.
  - Position 3: T -> we don't know about T at position 3.
  - Position 4: T -> we know T is correct at 4.
  - Position 5: Y -> we know Y is correct at 5.

So if the secret word is ""NUTTY"", then we get it right.

If not, we get feedback that tells us about the T at position 3 and also confirms the positions of N and U.

So it's a good guess.

Therefore, third guess: ""NUTTY""

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)**  
   - **C, R, A, E** are **not** in the secret word.  
   - **N** is in the word but **not in position 4**.  

2. **Guess 2: ""unity"" → Feedback: U(-), N(-), I(x), T(✓), Y(✓)**  
   - **U** is in the word but **not in position 1**.  
   - **N** is in the word but **not in position 2** (consistent with prior feedback that it's not in position 4).  
   - **I** is **not** in the word.  
   - **T** is correct and in **position 4**.  
   - **Y** is correct and in **position 5**.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word ends with **""TY""** (positions 4 and 5 are fixed as T and Y).  
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: U, N, T, Y.  
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, E, I (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - U cannot be in position 1 (from ""unity"" feedback).  
  - N cannot be in position 2 or 4 (from both guesses).  
- The word structure is `[letter1][letter2][letter3]TY`, where:  
  - `letter1`, `letter2`, `letter3` must include **U** and **N** (each appearing once, based on current data), plus one **new letter**.  
  - Possible configurations for U and N:  
    - **Option 1**: N at position 1, U at position 2 → `NU?TY`  
    - **Option 2**: N at position 1, U at position 3 → `N?UTY`  
    - **Option 3**: U at position 2, N at position 3 → `?UNTY`  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test **""NUTTY""** because:  
  - It fits `NU?TY` (Option 1), with N at position 1, U at position 2, and T at position 3.  
  - It includes the confirmed letters **U, N, T, Y** and avoids eliminated letters (C, R, A, E, I).  
  - The double T tests if the secret word has **two T's** (if the T at position 3 is valid, it will be marked ""✓"" or ""-""; if invalid, it will be ""x"").  
- If ""NUTTY"" is incorrect, the feedback will:  
  - Confirm or refute Option 1.  
  - Provide information about the new letter (if any) and the positions of U/N.  
- Common alternatives like `N?UTY` or `?UNTY` (e.g., ""NUTTY"" is the only common word ending in ""TY"" that fits the constraints and tests key positions.  

<guess>nutty</guess>",nutty,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Meaning:
  - C, R, A, E are not in the word.
  - N is in the word but not in the 4th position.

Guess 2: ""unity"" -> U(-), N(-), I(x), T(✓), Y(✓)
Meaning:
  - U is in the word but not in the 1st position.
  - N is in the word but not in the 2nd position (and we already knew it's not in the 4th from the first guess).
  - I is not in the word.
  - T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4? Let's check: ""unity"" is U-N-I-T-Y, so T is at position 4). So T is at position 4 and correct.
  - Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5). So Y is at position 5 and correct.

So from guess 2, we know:
  - The secret word has T at position 4 and Y at position 5. So the word ends with ""TY"".
  - U is in the word but not at position 1.
  - N is in the word but not at position 2 (and not at position 4, which we already knew).
  - I is not in the word.

Also, from guess 1, we know that the word does not contain C, R, A, E, and now also I is not in the word.

So the known correct positions:
  - Position 4: T
  - Position 5: Y

So the word is _ _ _ T Y.

We also know the word contains U and N, but we don't know their positions. They cannot be in positions that are already taken or where we know they are not.

Positions available: 1, 2, 3.

We know:
  - U cannot be at position 1 (from ""unity"" feedback: U is present but not at position 1).
  - N cannot be at position 2 (from ""unity"") and also not at position 4 (from ""crane"", but position 4 is now taken by T, so that's fine).

Therefore, for U and N, they must be in positions 1, 2, or 3, but with restrictions:
  - U cannot be in position 1 -> so U must be in position 2 or 3.
  - N cannot be in position 2 -> so N must be in position 1 or 3.

But note: we have two letters (U and N) to place in three positions (1,2,3) and one of these positions will be a new letter.

Also, we know the word has exactly these two letters (U and N) plus the T and Y, and one more letter that we haven't found yet? Actually, we know the word has U and N, and we have T and Y, so that's four letters. The fifth letter is missing and must be one that we haven't eliminated.

Eliminated letters so far: C, R, A, E, I (and also from the feedback, we know which are absent). Also, we have used U, N, T, Y, and we know they are in the word (except that I is not, but we already excluded I).

We must avoid: C, R, A, E, I.

We know the word has: U, N, T, Y.

And one more letter that we don't know yet.

So the word is: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] T Y

Where:
  - letter1, letter2, letter3 are to be filled with U, N, and one new letter (let's call it X), but note that U and N are already in the word, so they must appear exactly once? Or could they appear multiple times? We don't know, but so far we have only seen one of each.

But from the feedback, we know that U and N are present, but we don't know if they appear more than once. However, we have only seen one occurrence of each.

Given that, we can assume for now that they appear once, but we must be cautious.

Now, the constraints for U and N:
  - U cannot be in position 1 -> so U must be in position 2 or 3.
  - N cannot be in position 2 -> so N must be in position 1 or 3.

But note: if both U and N are in position 3, that's impossible. So the possibilities for positions 1,2,3:

Option 1: N at position 1, U at position 2, and then a new letter at position 3.
Option 2: N at position 1, U at position 3, and a new letter at position 2.
Option 3: U at position 2, N at position 3, and a new letter at position 1.
Option 4: U at position 3, N at position 1, and a new letter at position 2. (same as option 2? Actually, option 2 and 4 are the same: N at 1, U at 3, and new at 2)
Option 5: But we cannot have N at position 2 or U at position 1, so the above are the only possibilities.

Actually, let me list:

Position 1: can be N or the new letter (but not U).
Position 2: can be U or the new letter (but not N).
Position 3: can be U, N, or the new letter.

But note: if position 1 is N, then position 2 can be U or the new letter, and position 3 would be the remaining.
Similarly, if position 1 is the new letter, then position 2 must be U (because it can't be N and we have to place U) and then position 3 must be N? Or if position 2 is the new letter, then position 3 must be either U or N? Actually, we have to assign both U and N.

So the possibilities:

Case A: N at 1, then:
   - U at 2: then new letter at 3 -> word: N U ? T Y
   - U at 3: then new letter at 2 -> word: N ? U T Y

Case B: U at 2, then:
   - N at 1: that's the same as above (N at 1, U at 2) -> word: N U ? T Y
   - N at 3: then new letter at 1 -> word: ? U N T Y

Case C: U at 3, then:
   - N at 1: then new letter at 2 -> word: N ? U T Y
   - N cannot be at 2, so if U is at 3, then N must be at 1? Because if N is at 1, then we have the case above.

Actually, the distinct cases are:

1. N at 1, U at 2, and new letter at 3: ""NU?TY""
2. N at 1, U at 3, and new letter at 2: ""N?UTY""
3. U at 2, N at 3, and new letter at 1: ""?UNTY""

We don't have a case with U at 3 and N at 1? That's the same as case 2.

So three distinct patterns.

Now, we need to find a word that fits one of these patterns and uses a new letter that is not eliminated.

Eliminated letters: C, R, A, E, I.

We also have to consider that the new letter must be a letter that hasn't been used and is not eliminated.

We can try to guess a word that tests these possibilities.

But note: we have T and Y fixed at the end, and we know U and N are present. We need to find the new letter and the positions of U and N.

We can try to use a word that has the pattern of one of these and uses a common letter for the unknown.

But we have three cases. We might be able to cover two cases with one guess? Or we can choose a word that tests the position of U and N and also tests a new letter.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has the known T and Y at the end, and then for the first three positions, we try to include U and N and a new letter, but in a way that we can distinguish the cases.

But note: we have only three positions to assign and we have two known letters (U and N) and one unknown.

We can try to guess a word that has the form:

Option: ""NUTTY"" -> but that has two T's? We don't know if T appears twice. But we know T is at position 4, so if we put T at position 3, that would be a different T. But the feedback for T in ""unity"" was only for position 4. We don't know if there is another T.

But we can try. However, ""NUTTY"" has two T's. Let me see: N U T T Y. But we have T at position 3 and 4. We don't know if the word has two T's.

But we can consider it. However, we are limited by the eliminated letters.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that uses common letters that are not eliminated.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Z (and Y and T are already in, but we are using them at the end).

We can try to form words for the patterns:

Pattern 1: ""NU?TY"" -> e.g., N U * T Y. What words? 
  - NUTTY? But that would be N U T T Y -> but then the third letter is T, which we already have at position 4. But that's allowed if the word has two T's. But we don't know.

Pattern 2: ""N?UTY"" -> e.g., N * U T Y. Words: 
  - NETTY? But E is eliminated.
  - NATTY? But A is eliminated.
  - NOTTY? Not a word.
  - NITTY? But I is eliminated.
  - So maybe ""NUTTY"" is the only common one? But that's pattern 1.

Pattern 3: ""?UNTY"" -> * U N T Y. Words:
  - BUNTY? Not common.
  - DUNTY? Not a word.
  - HUNTY? Not a word.
  - LUNTY? Not a word.
  - MUNTY? Not a word.
  - PUNTY? Not a word.
  - SUNTY? Not a word.
  - Actually, common word: ""PUNTY"" is not standard. But ""BUNTY"" isn't either.

Wait, what about ""PUNNY""? But that has two N's and ends with NY, not TY.

We need to end with TY.

Another idea: ""COUNTY"" -> but that has C and O? C is eliminated, and O is new. But C is eliminated, so we can't use C.

""MOUNTY"" -> M O U N T Y -> but that's 6 letters? No, 5: M O U N T -> but then we have T at position 5? No, ""MOUNT"" is 5 letters? M-O-U-N-T, so T is at position 5, but we need T at position 4 and Y at 5. So that doesn't fit.

We have to have T at 4 and Y at 5. So the word must end with ""TY"".

So the last two letters are fixed.

Now, let's think of words ending with ""TY"" that have U and N and one more letter, and avoid C,R,A,E,I.

Common words ending with ""TY"": 
  - PARTY: but has A and R, eliminated.
  - DIRTY: has I and D? I is eliminated.
  - DUTY: D U T Y -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5. So no.
  - We need 5-letter words.

5-letter words ending with ""TY"":
  - PARTY (eliminated)
  - DIRTY (eliminated)
  - DUTY is 4 letters.
  - TESTY: T E S T Y -> but E is eliminated.
  - NINETY: 6 letters.
  - MISTY: M I S T Y -> I is eliminated.
  - MUSTY: M U S T Y -> this is 5 letters: M-U-S-T-Y. But note: we have T at position 4? In ""MUSTY"": positions: 1:M, 2:U, 3:S, 4:T, 5:Y -> so that fits the pattern: _ _ _ T Y.

But does it have an N? We know the word must have an N. ""MUSTY"" has M, U, S, T, Y. It does not have N. So that cannot be.

Similarly, ""RUSTY"": R and U, S, T, Y -> R is eliminated.

""GUSTY"": G U S T Y -> no N.

""DUSTY"": D U S T Y -> no N.

""HASTY"": H A S T Y -> A eliminated.

""NASTY"": N A S T Y -> A eliminated.

""PASTY"": P A S T Y -> A eliminated.

""TASTY"": T A S T Y -> A eliminated and also two T's? But A is eliminated.

We need a word that has N and U and ends with TY.

Let me search for words: 
  - NUTTY: N U T T Y -> positions: 1:N, 2:U, 3:T, 4:T, 5:Y -> but we have T at position 3 and 4. We know T is at position 4, but we don't know about position 3. Also, it has two T's. And it has U at position 2 and N at position 1.

This fits pattern 1: ""NUTTY""

But is ""NUTTY"" a word? Yes, meaning nutlike or containing nuts.

Now, does it avoid eliminated letters? It has N, U, T, T, Y. Eliminated letters are C,R,A,E,I. So yes.

But we have two T's. We don't know if the secret word has two T's. But it's possible.

Another word: ""BUNTY""? Not a word.

""PUNTY"" is not a common word, but in glassblowing? Not common.

""LUNTY""? Not a word.

""COUNTY"" has C, eliminated.

""MOUNTY"" is not 5 letters? ""MOUNTY"" isn't standard. The word is ""mount"" but that's 5 letters without Y? We need the Y at the end.

Another idea: ""AUNTY"" -> but A is eliminated.

So ""NUTTY"" seems a candidate.

But let's see pattern 2: ""N?UTY"", meaning N at 1, then a letter, then U, then T, then Y. So ""N?UTY"". What words?
  - NATUY? Not a word.
  - NETUY? Not a word.
  - NITUY? Not a word.
  - NOTUY? Not a word.
  - NUTUY? Not a word.

I can't think of any common word for pattern 2.

Pattern 3: ""?UNTY"", meaning a letter, then U, then N, then T, then Y. So words like ""BUNTY"", ""DUNTY"", etc. but not common. However, ""PUNTY"" is not common. But there is ""BUNNY"" but that ends with NY.

Wait, what about ""FUNKY""? But that ends with KY.

Another word: ""JUNKY"" but ends with KY.

We need TY.

Perhaps ""HUNTY"" is not a word. But ""HUNTS"" is without Y.

So the only common word that fits the pattern and has U, N, and ends with TY is ""NUTTY"".

But let me double-check: is there a word like ""DUTY"" with 5 letters? No.

""BEAUTY"" is 5 letters? B-E-A-U-T-Y -> 6 letters.

So ""NUTTY"" seems the only common word.

But we have feedback that in ""unity"", U was present but not at position 1, and in ""NUTTY"", U is at position 2. That is allowed.

Also, N is at position 1, and we had no feedback that N cannot be at position 1. In fact, we only know it's not at 2 or 4.

So ""NUTTY"" is a valid candidate.

But note: in ""NUTTY"", the third letter is T. We already know that T is at position 4. If the secret word has two T's, then it's okay. If not, then the T at position 3 would be incorrect.

But we don't know if there is a T at position 3.

Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that doesn't assume two T's and tests the other possibilities.

But we don't have many options.

We can try to guess a word that has the pattern of case 3: ""?UNTY"", but with a letter that is common and not eliminated.

For example, what if we try ""HUNTY""? But it's not a word. ""PUNTY"" is not a word.

""COUNTY"" has C.

""MOUNT"" is 5 letters but without Y? We need the Y at the end.

Another idea: ""MINTY"" -> M I N T Y -> but I is eliminated.

""TUNNY"" -> T U N N Y -> but that ends with NY, not TY.

We must have T at 4 and Y at 5.

So I think ""NUTTY"" is the best guess.

But let's consider: we have three cases, and we can design a guess that helps distinguish.

We can try to use a word that has U in position 3 and N in position 1, for example, and a new letter. But we don't have a common word for that.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has the new letter and tests the presence of other common letters.

But we know the word has U and N, so we must include them.

We can try ""POUND"" but that doesn't end with TY.

We have to keep T and Y fixed at the end.

So the guess must end with ""TY"".

Therefore, I think we should guess ""NUTTY"".

But let me see if there is another word for pattern 3.

What about ""DAUNT""? But that ends with T, not TY, and has A.

No.

So I'll go with ""NUTTY"".

But note: in ""NUTTY"", the letter T appears at position 3 and 4. We don't know if the secret word has two T's. But if it doesn't, then the T at position 3 would be marked as absent or wrong position? 

In the feedback, if the secret word has only one T (at position 4), then in ""NUTTY"", the T at position 3 would be marked as absent (x) because the T at position 4 is already accounted for? Or if the secret word has one T, then the first T (position 3) might be marked as present but wrong position? But then it would be moved to the correct position? 

Actually, the rules: if there is only one T in the secret word, and you have two T's in the guess, then one of them will be marked correctly (if in the right position) and the other as absent. Since in ""NUTTY"", the T at position 4 is correct, then the T at position 3 would be marked as absent (x) because there is no extra T in the word.

But we don't know if the word has one or two T's.

So by guessing ""NUTTY"", we can get information.

Alternatively, we can try to avoid the double T and guess a word that has a different letter at position 3.

But what word? For example, ""NURTY"" is not a word.

""NUFTY""? Not a word.

""NUMTY""? Not a word.

So I think ""NUTTY"" is acceptable.

Therefore, I will guess ""NUTTY"".

But let me check the pattern: in ""NUTTY"", we have:
  - Position 1: N -> we don't know if N is at position 1? But we know N is in the word and not at 2 or 4, so it could be at 1.
  - Position 2: U -> we know U is in the word and not at 1, so position 2 is possible.
  - Position 3: T -> we don't know about T at position 3.
  - Position 4: T -> we know T is correct at 4.
  - Position 5: Y -> we know Y is correct at 5.

So if the secret word is ""NUTTY"", then we get it right.

If not, we get feedback that tells us about the T at position 3 and also confirms the positions of N and U.

So it's a good guess.

Therefore, third guess: ""NUTTY""

<guess>nutty</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)**  
   - **C, R, A, E** are **not** in the secret word.  
   - **N** is in the word but **not in position 4**.  

2. **Guess 2: ""unity"" → Feedback: U(-), N(-), I(x), T(✓), Y(✓)**  
   - **U** is in the word but **not in position 1**.  
   - **N** is in the word but **not in position 2** (consistent with prior feedback that it's not in position 4).  
   - **I** is **not** in the word.  
   - **T** is correct and in **position 4**.  
   - **Y** is correct and in **position 5**.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word ends with **""TY""** (positions 4 and 5 are fixed as T and Y).  
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: U, N, T, Y.  
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, E, I (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - U cannot be in position 1 (from ""unity"" feedback).  
  - N cannot be in position 2 or 4 (from both guesses).  
- The word structure is `[letter1][letter2][letter3]TY`, where:  
  - `letter1`, `letter2`, `letter3` must include **U** and **N** (each appearing once, based on current data), plus one **new letter**.  
  - Possible configurations for U and N:  
    - **Option 1**: N at position 1, U at position 2 → `NU?TY`  
    - **Option 2**: N at position 1, U at position 3 → `N?UTY`  
    - **Option 3**: U at position 2, N at position 3 → `?UNTY`  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test **""NUTTY""** because:  
  - It fits `NU?TY` (Option 1), with N at position 1, U at position 2, and T at position 3.  
  - It includes the confirmed letters **U, N, T, Y** and avoids eliminated letters (C, R, A, E, I).  
  - The double T tests if the secret word has **two T's** (if the T at position 3 is valid, it will be marked ""✓"" or ""-""; if invalid, it will be ""x"").  
- If ""NUTTY"" is incorrect, the feedback will:  
  - Confirm or refute Option 1.  
  - Provide information about the new letter (if any) and the positions of U/N.  
- Common alternatives like `N?UTY` or `?UNTY` (e.g., ""NUTTY"" is the only common word ending in ""TY"" that fits the constraints and tests key positions.",Guess 3: nutty -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) U(✓) T(✓) T(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
