We are starting the game. We need to make the first guess.
 Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 Common starting words in Wordle often use a variety of common letters and include both vowels and consonants.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. 
 Other common starters are ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", etc.

 Let's consider:
 - We want to cover frequent letters and also try to have a balance of vowels and consonants.
 - The word ""SOARE"" (a type of hawk) is sometimes used but might be too obscure? Alternatively, ""ARISE"" or ""RAISE"".

 However, since the problem doesn't specify the word list, we should stick with common words.

 I choose ""CRANE"" as it is a very common starting word.

 Therefore, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We received feedback for our first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x → C is not in the secret word.
 R: x → R is not in the secret word.
 A: x → A is not in the secret word.
 N: x → N is not in the secret word.
 E: ✓ → E is in the word and in the correct position. Since E was the last letter, it must be the 5th letter of the secret word.

 So, the secret word ends with E, and it does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 We have 6 tries, and this is our second try.

 We need to guess a 5-letter word that ends with E (since E is fixed in the 5th position) and does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 Also, since four letters were entirely absent, we should avoid those letters.

 We must choose a word that includes other common letters to maximize information.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

 Since E is already in position 5, we can try to put other vowels or consonants in the first four positions.

 Possible strategy: use a word with many new letters and that ends with E.

 Examples of words ending with E: 
 - Other than the letters we know that are not present (C,R,A,N), we have many options.

 Let's think of common words ending in E:
   ""HOUSE"", ""MOUSE"", ""GOOSE"", ""WHITE"", ""SLATE"", ""PLATE"", ""SUITE"", ""QUITE"", ""SPIKE"", ""BIKE"", etc.

 But note: we also cannot use A (since feedback was A:x) and R (R:x) etc.

 So avoid: C, R, A, N.

 Words ending with E without C,R,A,N:

 - Some options: ""SLATE"", but it has A? Wait, A is not allowed? 
   Since A was marked x, it means A is not in the word at all. So we cannot use A.

 Let me check: feedback A(x) → A is not in the secret word. So we must avoid A.

 Therefore, ""SLATE"" is invalid because it contains A.

 Similarly, ""PLATE"" has A -> invalid.

 Better options:

   ""HOUSE"" - H, O, U, S, E → O, U, S are new.
   ""MOUSE"" - M, O, U, S, E → M, O, U, S are new.
   ""SUITE"" - S, U, I, T, E → S, U, I, T are new.
   ""QUITE"" - Q, U, I, T, E → Q is less common? Maybe not ideal for second guess.

 Additionally, we know the secret word does not have C, R, A, N.

 Since we need to cover more letters, let's try ""HOUSE"" or ""MOUSE"". But note: we have 5th letter E so both end with E.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that tests vowels and common consonants.

 Another idea: since the first four letters of crane were all wrong, we have a lot of freedom.

 But let's choose a word that has new letters and ends with E.

 I'll go with ""SUITE"": 
   S, U, I, T, E → these letters are all new (not C,R,A,N) and we get to check S, U, I, T.

 If we get feedback, it might tell us about these letters.

 Another option is ""SPITE"", but that has P and I and T. Or ""SLIME"" but has L, I, M. 

 However, ""SUITE"" seems good.

 Alternatively, ""WHITE"" has W, H, I, T, E → no C,R,A,N.

 But note: in ""SUITE"", the E is in the correct position so we know it will be marked ✓ for the last letter.

 But we don't know about the others.

 Let me search for more common words: 
   ""THYME"" → has Y and M, but might be less common.
   ""STOLE"" → but E is at the end, but it has O and L? However, S and T are common.

 But we must avoid A and R? ""STOLE"" doesn't have A or R, so it's okay.

 Also, ""SOLEM""? not a word. 

 Another: ""SHINE"" → S, H, I, N, E → but N we know is not in the word! Because first feedback N:x. So we cannot use N.

 So we must avoid N as well? Yes, because feedback for N was x → not in the word.

 Therefore, we cannot have any of the letters C, R, A, N.

 So the letters to avoid: C, R, A, N.

 For the second guess we need:

   5-letter word, ending in E (because E is correct in the last position) and does not contain C,R,A,N.

 Options:

   ""HOUSE"" → H, O, U, S, E → okay.
   ""MOUSE"" → M, O, U, S, E → okay.
   ""SUITE"" → S, U, I, T, E → okay.
   ""WHITE"" → W, H, I, T, E → okay.
   ""SLOPE"" → S, L, O, P, E → okay, but note we are avoiding A and R? No R? Wait, R is excluded? Yes, no R. So okay.
   ""STYLE"" → S, T, Y, L, E → okay.
   ""SMILE"" → S, M, I, L, E → okay.
   ""SPITE"" → S, P, I, T, E → okay.

 I think ""SUITE"" is a good choice because it has U and I (vowels) and S and T (common consonants).

 But note: the word ""SUITE"" may not be as common as ""HOUSE"". 

 Alternatively, ""HOUSE"" is very common.

 However, we want to cover vowels: U and I vs O and U? 

 Also, we can consider the frequency of letters:

   English letter frequency: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U...
   Since A, N, R are excluded, then common letters are T, O, I, S, H, L, U, etc.

 So let's choose ""HOUSE"" because it has H, O, U, S and we already know E is at the end.

 But wait, the feedback only told us that E is at the 5th position. The rest could be anywhere? Actually, we don't have any other information.

 Alternatively, to cover more common letters, we can pick a word with T and O? But ""HOUSE"" doesn't have T.

 Another option: ""STOLE"" → S, T, O, L, E. This covers a lot of common letters: S, T, O, L.

 So ""STOLE"" might be good: letters S, T, O, L, E → avoiding A, R, C, N.

 Also, E is in the last position so that's correct.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""STOLE"".

 But note: we have to make sure it's a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" was disqualified because of A. 

 But ""STOLE"" is valid? Yes.

 So I choose ""STOLE"".

 Summary: we are guessing ""STOLE"" to test S, T, O, L and confirm E at the end.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Analyze previous feedback:**  
   - First guess: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓).  
   - This means:  
     - E is **in the secret word** and in the **correct position (5th letter)**.  
     - The letters C, R, A, and N are **not in the secret word at all**.  

2. **Constraints for the next guess:**  
   - The secret word must end with E (position 5 is fixed).  
   - The guess cannot include C, R, A, or N (since they are absent from the secret word).  
   - We need to maximize information by testing new common letters like S, T, O, L, I, H, U, etc.  
   - Avoid reusing eliminated letters to prevent wasted guesses.  

3. **Select a high-information word:**  
   - Ideal candidates should:  
     - End with E.  
     - Contain frequent unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, L).  
     - Exclude C, R, A, N.  
   - Options considered:  
     - ""HOUSE"" → Tests H, O, U, S.  
     - ""SUITE"" → Tests S, U, I, T.  
     - ""STOLE"" → Tests S, T, O, L (covers very common consonants/vowels).  
   - ""STOLE"" is chosen because it:  
     - Uses four new high-frequency letters (S, T, O, L).  
     - Maintains E in position 5.  
     - Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, A, N).  

4. **Goal:**  
   - Validate which of S, T, O, L are present and their positions to narrow down possibilities.  
   - Examples of possible secret words: ""STYLE"", ""SMOKE"", ""WHOLE"", ""POKE"", etc. (all ending in E, excluding C/R/A/N).  

<guess>stole</guess>",stole,"We received feedback for our first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x → C is not in the secret word.
 R: x → R is not in the secret word.
 A: x → A is not in the secret word.
 N: x → N is not in the secret word.
 E: ✓ → E is in the word and in the correct position. Since E was the last letter, it must be the 5th letter of the secret word.

 So, the secret word ends with E, and it does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 We have 6 tries, and this is our second try.

 Also, since four letters were entirely absent, we should avoid those letters.

 We must choose a word that includes other common letters to maximize information.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

 Since E is already in position 5, we can try to put other vowels or consonants in the first four positions.

 Possible strategy: use a word with many new letters and that ends with E.

 Examples of words ending with E: 
 - Other than the letters we know that are not present (C,R,A,N), we have many options.

 Let's think of common words ending in E:
   ""HOUSE"", ""MOUSE"", ""GOOSE"", ""WHITE"", ""SLATE"", ""PLATE"", ""SUITE"", ""QUITE"", ""SPIKE"", ""BIKE"", etc.

 But note: we also cannot use A (since feedback was A:x) and R (R:x) etc.

 So avoid: C, R, A, N.

 Words ending with E without C,R,A,N:

 - Some options: ""SLATE"", but it has A? Wait, A is not allowed? 
   Since A was marked x, it means A is not in the word at all. So we cannot use A.

 Let me check: feedback A(x) → A is not in the secret word. So we must avoid A.

 Therefore, ""SLATE"" is invalid because it contains A.

 Similarly, ""PLATE"" has A -> invalid.

 Better options:

   ""HOUSE"" - H, O, U, S, E → O, U, S are new.
   ""MOUSE"" - M, O, U, S, E → M, O, U, S are new.
   ""SUITE"" - S, U, I, T, E → S, U, I, T are new.
   ""QUITE"" - Q, U, I, T, E → Q is less common? Maybe not ideal for second guess.

 Additionally, we know the secret word does not have C, R, A, N.

 Since we need to cover more letters, let's try ""HOUSE"" or ""MOUSE"". But note: we have 5th letter E so both end with E.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that tests vowels and common consonants.

 Another idea: since the first four letters of crane were all wrong, we have a lot of freedom.

 But let's choose a word that has new letters and ends with E.

 I'll go with ""SUITE"": 
   S, U, I, T, E → these letters are all new (not C,R,A,N) and we get to check S, U, I, T.

 If we get feedback, it might tell us about these letters.

 Another option is ""SPITE"", but that has P and I and T. Or ""SLIME"" but has L, I, M. 

 However, ""SUITE"" seems good.

 Alternatively, ""WHITE"" has W, H, I, T, E → no C,R,A,N.

 But note: in ""SUITE"", the E is in the correct position so we know it will be marked ✓ for the last letter.

 But we don't know about the others.

 Let me search for more common words: 
   ""THYME"" → has Y and M, but might be less common.
   ""STOLE"" → but E is at the end, but it has O and L? However, S and T are common.

 But we must avoid A and R? ""STOLE"" doesn't have A or R, so it's okay.

 Also, ""SOLEM""? not a word. 

 Another: ""SHINE"" → S, H, I, N, E → but N we know is not in the word! Because first feedback N:x. So we cannot use N.

 So we must avoid N as well? Yes, because feedback for N was x → not in the word.

 Therefore, we cannot have any of the letters C, R, A, N.

 So the letters to avoid: C, R, A, N.

 For the second guess we need:

   5-letter word, ending in E (because E is correct in the last position) and does not contain C,R,A,N.

 Options:

   ""HOUSE"" → H, O, U, S, E → okay.
   ""MOUSE"" → M, O, U, S, E → okay.
   ""SUITE"" → S, U, I, T, E → okay.
   ""WHITE"" → W, H, I, T, E → okay.
   ""SLOPE"" → S, L, O, P, E → okay, but note we are avoiding A and R? No R? Wait, R is excluded? Yes, no R. So okay.
   ""STYLE"" → S, T, Y, L, E → okay.
   ""SMILE"" → S, M, I, L, E → okay.
   ""SPITE"" → S, P, I, T, E → okay.

 I think ""SUITE"" is a good choice because it has U and I (vowels) and S and T (common consonants).

 But note: the word ""SUITE"" may not be as common as ""HOUSE"". 

 Alternatively, ""HOUSE"" is very common.

 However, we want to cover vowels: U and I vs O and U? 

 Also, we can consider the frequency of letters:

   English letter frequency: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U...
   Since A, N, R are excluded, then common letters are T, O, I, S, H, L, U, etc.

 So let's choose ""HOUSE"" because it has H, O, U, S and we already know E is at the end.

 But wait, the feedback only told us that E is at the 5th position. The rest could be anywhere? Actually, we don't have any other information.

 Alternatively, to cover more common letters, we can pick a word with T and O? But ""HOUSE"" doesn't have T.

 Another option: ""STOLE"" → S, T, O, L, E. This covers a lot of common letters: S, T, O, L.

 So ""STOLE"" might be good: letters S, T, O, L, E → avoiding A, R, C, N.

 Also, E is in the last position so that's correct.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""STOLE"".

 But note: we have to make sure it's a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" was disqualified because of A. 

 But ""STOLE"" is valid? Yes.

 So I choose ""STOLE"".

 Summary: we are guessing ""STOLE"" to test S, T, O, L and confirm E at the end.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

 Since E is already in position 5, we can try to put other vowels or consonants in the first four positions.

 Possible strategy: use a word with many new letters and that ends with E.

 Examples of words ending with E: 
 - Other than the letters we know that are not present (C,R,A,N), we have many options.

 Let's think of common words ending in E:
   ""HOUSE"", ""MOUSE"", ""GOOSE"", ""WHITE"", ""SLATE"", ""PLATE"", ""SUITE"", ""QUITE"", ""SPIKE"", ""BIKE"", etc.

 But note: we also cannot use A (since feedback was A:x) and R (R:x) etc.

 So avoid: C, R, A, N.

 Words ending with E without C,R,A,N:

 - Some options: ""SLATE"", but it has A? Wait, A is not allowed? 
   Since A was marked x, it means A is not in the word at all. So we cannot use A.

 Let me check: feedback A(x) → A is not in the secret word. So we must avoid A.

 Therefore, ""SLATE"" is invalid because it contains A.

 Similarly, ""PLATE"" has A -> invalid.

 Better options:

   ""HOUSE"" - H, O, U, S, E → O, U, S are new.
   ""MOUSE"" - M, O, U, S, E → M, O, U, S are new.
   ""SUITE"" - S, U, I, T, E → S, U, I, T are new.
   ""QUITE"" - Q, U, I, T, E → Q is less common? Maybe not ideal for second guess.

 Additionally, we know the secret word does not have C, R, A, N.

 Since we need to cover more letters, let's try ""HOUSE"" or ""MOUSE"". But note: we have 5th letter E so both end with E.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that tests vowels and common consonants.

 Another idea: since the first four letters of crane were all wrong, we have a lot of freedom.

 But let's choose a word that has new letters and ends with E.

 I'll go with ""SUITE"": 
   S, U, I, T, E → these letters are all new (not C,R,A,N) and we get to check S, U, I, T.

 If we get feedback, it might tell us about these letters.

 Another option is ""SPITE"", but that has P and I and T. Or ""SLIME"" but has L, I, M. 

 However, ""SUITE"" seems good.

 Alternatively, ""WHITE"" has W, H, I, T, E → no C,R,A,N.

 But note: in ""SUITE"", the E is in the correct position so we know it will be marked ✓ for the last letter.

 But we don't know about the others.

 Let me search for more common words: 
   ""THYME"" → has Y and M, but might be less common.
   ""STOLE"" → but E is at the end, but it has O and L? However, S and T are common.

 But we must avoid A and R? ""STOLE"" doesn't have A or R, so it's okay.

 Also, ""SOLEM""? not a word. 

 Another: ""SHINE"" → S, H, I, N, E → but N we know is not in the word! Because first feedback N:x. So we cannot use N.

 So we must avoid N as well? Yes, because feedback for N was x → not in the word.

 Therefore, we cannot have any of the letters C, R, A, N.

 So the letters to avoid: C, R, A, N.

 For the second guess we need:

   5-letter word, ending in E (because E is correct in the last position) and does not contain C,R,A,N.

 Options:

   ""HOUSE"" → H, O, U, S, E → okay.
   ""MOUSE"" → M, O, U, S, E → okay.
   ""SUITE"" → S, U, I, T, E → okay.
   ""WHITE"" → W, H, I, T, E → okay.
   ""SLOPE"" → S, L, O, P, E → okay, but note we are avoiding A and R? No R? Wait, R is excluded? Yes, no R. So okay.
   ""STYLE"" → S, T, Y, L, E → okay.
   ""SMILE"" → S, M, I, L, E → okay.
   ""SPITE"" → S, P, I, T, E → okay.

 I think ""SUITE"" is a good choice because it has U and I (vowels) and S and T (common consonants).

 But note: the word ""SUITE"" may not be as common as ""HOUSE"". 

 Alternatively, ""HOUSE"" is very common.

 However, we want to cover vowels: U and I vs O and U? 

 Also, we can consider the frequency of letters:

   English letter frequency: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U...
   Since A, N, R are excluded, then common letters are T, O, I, S, H, L, U, etc.

 So let's choose ""HOUSE"" because it has H, O, U, S and we already know E is at the end.

 But wait, the feedback only told us that E is at the 5th position. The rest could be anywhere? Actually, we don't have any other information.

 Alternatively, to cover more common letters, we can pick a word with T and O? But ""HOUSE"" doesn't have T.

 Another option: ""STOLE"" → S, T, O, L, E. This covers a lot of common letters: S, T, O, L.

 So ""STOLE"" might be good: letters S, T, O, L, E → avoiding A, R, C, N.

 Also, E is in the last position so that's correct.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""STOLE"".

 But note: we have to make sure it's a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" was disqualified because of A. 

 But ""STOLE"" is valid? Yes.

 So I choose ""STOLE"".

 Summary: we are guessing ""STOLE"" to test S, T, O, L and confirm E at the end.

<guess>stole</guess>**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Analyze previous feedback:**  
   - First guess: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓).  
   - This means:  
     - E is **in the secret word** and in the **correct position (5th letter)**.  
     - The letters C, R, A, and N are **not in the secret word at all**.  

2. **Constraints for the next guess:**  
   - The secret word must end with E (position 5 is fixed).  
   - The guess cannot include C, R, A, or N (since they are absent from the secret word).  
   - We need to maximize information by testing new common letters like S, T, O, L, I, H, U, etc.  
   - Avoid reusing eliminated letters to prevent wasted guesses.  

3. **Select a high-information word:**  
   - Ideal candidates should:  
     - End with E.  
     - Contain frequent unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, L).  
     - Exclude C, R, A, N.  
   - Options considered:  
     - ""HOUSE"" → Tests H, O, U, S.  
     - ""SUITE"" → Tests S, U, I, T.  
     - ""STOLE"" → Tests S, T, O, L (covers very common consonants/vowels).  
   - ""STOLE"" is chosen because it:  
     - Uses four new high-frequency letters (S, T, O, L).  
     - Maintains E in position 5.  
     - Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, A, N).  

4. **Goal:**  
   - Validate which of S, T, O, L are present and their positions to narrow down possibilities.  
   - Examples of possible secret words: ""STYLE"", ""SMOKE"", ""WHOLE"", ""POKE"", etc. (all ending in E, excluding C/R/A/N).

We have feedback from two guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
   - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).
   - C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

2. ""stole"" -> S(x), T(-), O(x), L(-), E(✓)
   - E is still correct in the 5th position (as expected).
   - T is in the word but not in the 2nd position (since we guessed T in position 2 and got ""-"", meaning it's present but misplaced).
   - L is in the word but not in the 4th position (misplaced).
   - S and O are not in the word at all.

So, from both guesses, we know:

- The secret word ends with E (position 5).
- The secret word contains T and L, but not in the positions we guessed (T was in position 2, L in position 4 in ""stole"").
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, S, O.

Also, since T and L are present, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We must avoid the letters: C, R, A, N, S, O.

We know the word has T and L, and ends with E.

We also know that T cannot be in position 2, and L cannot be in position 4.

Possible positions for T: 1, 3, or 4? (but note: positions are 1 to 5, but position 5 is E, so T can be in 1, 3, or 4).

Similarly, L can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5? But position 5 is E, so L cannot be in 5. So L can be in 1, 2, or 3.

But we also know that L is not in position 4 (from ""stole"" feedback), but that's already covered.

Now, we need to think of a word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Contains T and L (and we know they are not in positions 2 and 4 respectively, but they could be in other positions)
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, S, O
- We should also try to include other common letters to get more information.

Available letters: We have to use letters from the remaining alphabet, avoiding C, R, A, N, S, O.

Common letters left: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But E and T are already known to be in the word, and L is also known. So we might not need to include them again? But we can to test positions.

However, we have limited guesses, so we should try to cover new letters.

But we also need to fix the positions of T and L.

Let's list the constraints:

- Position 5: E
- T is in the word, but not in position 2.
- L is in the word, but not in position 4.

We don't know the positions of T and L yet.

We should try a word that places T and L in different positions to test.

Also, we need to avoid S and O now, which are new absent letters.

Possible words:

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing T and L, without C,R,A,N,S,O.

Let me think of some words:

- ""TITLE"": T, I, T, L, E -> but has double T? And positions: T at 1, T at 3, L at 4, E at 5. But we know L cannot be at position 4? From ""stole"" feedback, L was at position 4 and got ""-"", meaning L is in the word but not at position 4. So if we put L at position 4 again, it would be incorrect. So ""TITLE"" has L at position 4, which is invalid because we know L is not at position 4.

- ""LATTE"": but has A and A is excluded. Also, A is not allowed.

- ""LITHE"": L, I, T, H, E -> ends with E, has L and T. Letters: L, I, T, H, E. Check exclusions: no C,R,A,N,S,O. So okay. Positions: L at 1, I at 2, T at 3, H at 4, E at 5.

But we know T cannot be at position 2? In this word, T is at position 3, which is fine. And L is at position 1, which is allowed (since we only know it's not at 4).

So ""LITHE"" is a candidate.

- ""ELITE"": E, L, I, T, E -> ends with E, has L and T. But position 1 is E? But we don't know if E is at position 1. Also, it has two E's? The secret word might have multiple E's? But we only know about position 5. However, in ""crane"", we had E at position 5 and no other E? But we don't know. Also, ""ELITE"" has E at position 1 and 5. But we are avoiding? Letters: E, L, I, T, E. Exclusions: no C,R,A,N,S,O. So it's allowed. But we are testing position 1 with E? We don't know if E is at position 1. Also, we have T at position 4 and L at position 2.

But from feedback, we know T is not at position 2? No, we know T is not at position 2 from ""stole"", but in ""ELITE"", T is at position 4, which is fine. And L is at position 2, which we don't have information about (we only know L is not at position 4).

So ""ELITE"" is also a candidate.

But we have to choose one.

Another word: ""UTILE"": U, T, I, L, E -> ends with E, has T and L. Letters: U, T, I, L, E. No C,R,A,N,S,O. Positions: U at 1, T at 2, I at 3, L at 4, E at 5.

But we know T cannot be at position 2? From ""stole"", T was at position 2 and got ""-"", meaning T is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put T at position 2 again, it would be wrong. So ""UTILE"" has T at position 2, which is invalid.

Similarly, L at position 4: we know L is not at position 4, so ""UTILE"" has L at 4, which is also invalid. So ""UTILE"" is not good.

""TILDE"": T, I, L, D, E -> ends with E, has T and L. Letters: T, I, L, D, E. No C,R,A,N,S,O. Positions: T at 1, I at 2, L at 3, D at 4, E at 5.

Now, T at position 1: we don't know if that's allowed. L at position 3: we don't have information. So this is a candidate.

But we need to test more letters? We have D, which is a common letter.

Another candidate: ""BILGE"": B, I, L, G, E -> has L and E, but missing T? We know T must be in the word, so we must include T in the guess to get its position. So we cannot omit T.

Similarly, we must include L and E (E is fixed at the end).

So the word must contain T and L, and end with E.

So ""BILGE"" doesn't have T, so it's invalid for testing.

We need to include T and L.

Back to ""LITHE"": L at 1, I at 2, T at 3, H at 4, E at 5.

This seems good because:
- We test L at position 1 (if it's correct, we get a ✓, if not, we know it's misplaced or wrong, but we know it's in the word so it must be misplaced).
- We test T at position 3.
- We test new letters: I and H.

Similarly, ""TILDE"": T at 1, I at 2, L at 3, D at 4, E at 5.

But in ""TILDE"", we have L at position 3 and D at 4.

We know that L cannot be at position 4, but in this word L is at 3, so that's fine. Position 4 is D, which is new.

But we also know that T cannot be at position 2, but in this word T is at 1, so that's okay.

Now, which one to choose? Both are valid.

We can also consider ""THYME"": T, H, Y, M, E -> has T and E, but missing L? We must include L because we know L is in the word and we need to find its position. So ""THYME"" doesn't have L, so it's invalid.

""GLIDE"": G, L, I, D, E -> has L and E, but missing T? No T, so invalid.

We must have both T and L.

Another word: ""LUXTE"" - not a word.

""TWIxE"" - not.

""QUITE"" - has Q and U, but also has T and E, but no L? So invalid.

""LATKE"" - has A, excluded.

So I think ""LITHE"" and ""TILDE"" are good candidates.

Let me think of more: ""ELUTE""? E, L, U, T, E -> has E at start and end? But we don't know about position 1. Also, L at 2, U at 3, T at 4. But we know L cannot be at position 4? Here L is at 2. T is at 4. But we don't know if T can be at 4. Also, has two E's? But E is allowed multiple times? Possibly. But let's see: letters E, L, U, T, E. No C,R,A,N,S,O. So okay. But we are testing E at position 1? We don't know.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""LITHE"" is a good choice because it has H, which is a common letter.

""TILDE"" has D.

But let's consider the feedback we might get.

We need to maximize information.

We know the word has T and L, and E at the end.

Possible positions for T: 1, 3, or 4 (since not 2 and not 5).

Similarly, L: 1, 2, or 3 (since not 4 and not 5).

In ""LITHE"", we put L at 1 and T at 3.

In ""TILDE"", we put T at 1 and L at 3.

Both test L and T in positions that are possible.

But we also have to consider other letters.

Another word: ""LIFTE"" - not a word, or ""LIFTE"" is not standard; usually ""LIFT"" is 4 letters.

""LITHE"" means flexible or thin, and ""TILDE"" is a character.

But we'll assume they are valid.

I think ""LITHE"" is more common.

Alternatively, to avoid less common words, we can try ""TEPID"" but it doesn't end with E.

We need E at the end.

""EXILE"" - has X and I, but also E at start? And no T? Must have T.

""ELIDE"" - E, L, I, D, E -> has L and E, but no T? So invalid.

""TOILE"" - has O, but O is excluded.

So back to ""LITHE"" or ""TILDE"".

I'll go with ""LITHE"" because it has H, which is a common letter we haven't tested.

So guess: ""LITHE""

But let's confirm the letters: L, I, T, H, E. None of C,R,A,N,S,O. Good.

Positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:T, 4:H, 5:E.

We know position 5 is E, so that will be ✓.

We will get feedback on L at 1, I at 2, T at 3, H at 4.

This should help us locate T and L.

So I think that's a good guess.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)  
  - E is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 5.  
  - C, R, A, N are **not** in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: ""stole""** → S(x), T(-), O(x), L(-), E(✓)  
  - E is confirmed at position 5.  
  - T is in the word but **not** at position 2.  
  - L is in the word but **not** at position 4.  
  - S and O are **not** in the word.  

### Key Constraints for the Next Guess:
- The secret word **ends with E** (position 5 is fixed).  
- It **contains T and L**, but:  
  - T cannot be at position 2.  
  - L cannot be at position 4.  
- It **excludes** C, R, A, N, S, O.  
- We need to test new common letters (e.g., I, H, D, U) to gather more information.  

### Analysis:
- T must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since it can't be 2 or 5).  
- L must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (since it can't be 4 or 5).  
- The guess should prioritize:  
  - Testing possible positions for T and L.  
  - Introducing high-frequency unused letters (e.g., I, H, D, U) to maximize feedback.  
  - Avoiding excluded letters.  

### Selected Guess: ""LITHE""
- **Why ""LITHE""?**  
  - Ends with E (position 5), satisfying the fixed letter.  
  - Contains T and L, allowing us to test their positions:  
    - L at position 1 (possible location).  
    - T at position 3 (possible location).  
  - Introduces new common letters: I (position 2) and H (position 4).  
  - Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, A, N, S, O).  
  - ""LITHE"" is a valid English word (meaning ""thin and flexible"").  

### Expected Feedback Insights:
- If L is correct at position 1, we get ✓; if not, we learn if it's misplaced.  
- If T is correct at position 3, we get ✓; if not, we learn if it's misplaced.  
- Feedback on I and H will reveal if they are present and in the right positions.  

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities while testing key constraints.

<guess>lithe</guess>",lithe,"We have feedback from two guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
   - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).
   - C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

2. ""stole"" -> S(x), T(-), O(x), L(-), E(✓)
   - E is still correct in the 5th position (as expected).
   - T is in the word but not in the 2nd position (since we guessed T in position 2 and got ""-"", meaning it's present but misplaced).
   - L is in the word but not in the 4th position (misplaced).
   - S and O are not in the word at all.

So, from both guesses, we know:

- The secret word ends with E (position 5).
- The secret word contains T and L, but not in the positions we guessed (T was in position 2, L in position 4 in ""stole"").
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, S, O.

Also, since T and L are present, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We must avoid the letters: C, R, A, N, S, O.

We know the word has T and L, and ends with E.

We also know that T cannot be in position 2, and L cannot be in position 4.

Possible positions for T: 1, 3, or 4? (but note: positions are 1 to 5, but position 5 is E, so T can be in 1, 3, or 4).

Similarly, L can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5? But position 5 is E, so L cannot be in 5. So L can be in 1, 2, or 3.

But we also know that L is not in position 4 (from ""stole"" feedback), but that's already covered.

Now, we need to think of a word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Contains T and L (and we know they are not in positions 2 and 4 respectively, but they could be in other positions)
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, S, O
- We should also try to include other common letters to get more information.

Available letters: We have to use letters from the remaining alphabet, avoiding C, R, A, N, S, O.

Common letters left: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But E and T are already known to be in the word, and L is also known. So we might not need to include them again? But we can to test positions.

However, we have limited guesses, so we should try to cover new letters.

But we also need to fix the positions of T and L.

Let's list the constraints:

- Position 5: E
- T is in the word, but not in position 2.
- L is in the word, but not in position 4.

We don't know the positions of T and L yet.

We should try a word that places T and L in different positions to test.

Also, we need to avoid S and O now, which are new absent letters.

Possible words:

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing T and L, without C,R,A,N,S,O.

Let me think of some words:

- ""TITLE"": T, I, T, L, E -> but has double T? And positions: T at 1, T at 3, L at 4, E at 5. But we know L cannot be at position 4? From ""stole"" feedback, L was at position 4 and got ""-"", meaning L is in the word but not at position 4. So if we put L at position 4 again, it would be incorrect. So ""TITLE"" has L at position 4, which is invalid because we know L is not at position 4.

- ""LATTE"": but has A and A is excluded. Also, A is not allowed.

- ""LITHE"": L, I, T, H, E -> ends with E, has L and T. Letters: L, I, T, H, E. Check exclusions: no C,R,A,N,S,O. So okay. Positions: L at 1, I at 2, T at 3, H at 4, E at 5.

But we know T cannot be at position 2? In this word, T is at position 3, which is fine. And L is at position 1, which is allowed (since we only know it's not at 4).

So ""LITHE"" is a candidate.

- ""ELITE"": E, L, I, T, E -> ends with E, has L and T. But position 1 is E? But we don't know if E is at position 1. Also, it has two E's? The secret word might have multiple E's? But we only know about position 5. However, in ""crane"", we had E at position 5 and no other E? But we don't know. Also, ""ELITE"" has E at position 1 and 5. But we are avoiding? Letters: E, L, I, T, E. Exclusions: no C,R,A,N,S,O. So it's allowed. But we are testing position 1 with E? We don't know if E is at position 1. Also, we have T at position 4 and L at position 2.

But from feedback, we know T is not at position 2? No, we know T is not at position 2 from ""stole"", but in ""ELITE"", T is at position 4, which is fine. And L is at position 2, which we don't have information about (we only know L is not at position 4).

So ""ELITE"" is also a candidate.

But we have to choose one.

Another word: ""UTILE"": U, T, I, L, E -> ends with E, has T and L. Letters: U, T, I, L, E. No C,R,A,N,S,O. Positions: U at 1, T at 2, I at 3, L at 4, E at 5.

But we know T cannot be at position 2? From ""stole"", T was at position 2 and got ""-"", meaning T is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put T at position 2 again, it would be wrong. So ""UTILE"" has T at position 2, which is invalid.

Similarly, L at position 4: we know L is not at position 4, so ""UTILE"" has L at 4, which is also invalid. So ""UTILE"" is not good.

""TILDE"": T, I, L, D, E -> ends with E, has T and L. Letters: T, I, L, D, E. No C,R,A,N,S,O. Positions: T at 1, I at 2, L at 3, D at 4, E at 5.

Now, T at position 1: we don't know if that's allowed. L at position 3: we don't have information. So this is a candidate.

But we need to test more letters? We have D, which is a common letter.

Another candidate: ""BILGE"": B, I, L, G, E -> has L and E, but missing T? We know T must be in the word, so we must include T in the guess to get its position. So we cannot omit T.

Similarly, we must include L and E (E is fixed at the end).

So the word must contain T and L, and end with E.

So ""BILGE"" doesn't have T, so it's invalid for testing.

We need to include T and L.

Back to ""LITHE"": L at 1, I at 2, T at 3, H at 4, E at 5.

This seems good because:
- We test L at position 1 (if it's correct, we get a ✓, if not, we know it's misplaced or wrong, but we know it's in the word so it must be misplaced).
- We test T at position 3.
- We test new letters: I and H.

Similarly, ""TILDE"": T at 1, I at 2, L at 3, D at 4, E at 5.

But in ""TILDE"", we have L at position 3 and D at 4.

We know that L cannot be at position 4, but in this word L is at 3, so that's fine. Position 4 is D, which is new.

But we also know that T cannot be at position 2, but in this word T is at 1, so that's okay.

Now, which one to choose? Both are valid.

We can also consider ""THYME"": T, H, Y, M, E -> has T and E, but missing L? We must include L because we know L is in the word and we need to find its position. So ""THYME"" doesn't have L, so it's invalid.

""GLIDE"": G, L, I, D, E -> has L and E, but missing T? No T, so invalid.

We must have both T and L.

Another word: ""LUXTE"" - not a word.

""TWIxE"" - not.

""QUITE"" - has Q and U, but also has T and E, but no L? So invalid.

""LATKE"" - has A, excluded.

So I think ""LITHE"" and ""TILDE"" are good candidates.

Let me think of more: ""ELUTE""? E, L, U, T, E -> has E at start and end? But we don't know about position 1. Also, L at 2, U at 3, T at 4. But we know L cannot be at position 4? Here L is at 2. T is at 4. But we don't know if T can be at 4. Also, has two E's? But E is allowed multiple times? Possibly. But let's see: letters E, L, U, T, E. No C,R,A,N,S,O. So okay. But we are testing E at position 1? We don't know.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""LITHE"" is a good choice because it has H, which is a common letter.

""TILDE"" has D.

But let's consider the feedback we might get.

We need to maximize information.

We know the word has T and L, and E at the end.

Possible positions for T: 1, 3, or 4 (since not 2 and not 5).

Similarly, L: 1, 2, or 3 (since not 4 and not 5).

In ""LITHE"", we put L at 1 and T at 3.

In ""TILDE"", we put T at 1 and L at 3.

Both test L and T in positions that are possible.

But we also have to consider other letters.

Another word: ""LIFTE"" - not a word, or ""LIFTE"" is not standard; usually ""LIFT"" is 4 letters.

""LITHE"" means flexible or thin, and ""TILDE"" is a character.

But we'll assume they are valid.

I think ""LITHE"" is more common.

Alternatively, to avoid less common words, we can try ""TEPID"" but it doesn't end with E.

We need E at the end.

""EXILE"" - has X and I, but also E at start? And no T? Must have T.

""ELIDE"" - E, L, I, D, E -> has L and E, but no T? So invalid.

""TOILE"" - has O, but O is excluded.

So back to ""LITHE"" or ""TILDE"".

I'll go with ""LITHE"" because it has H, which is a common letter we haven't tested.

So guess: ""LITHE""

But let's confirm the letters: L, I, T, H, E. None of C,R,A,N,S,O. Good.

Positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:T, 4:H, 5:E.

We know position 5 is E, so that will be ✓.

We will get feedback on L at 1, I at 2, T at 3, H at 4.

This should help us locate T and L.

So I think that's a good guess.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)  
  - E is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 5.  
  - C, R, A, N are **not** in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: ""stole""** → S(x), T(-), O(x), L(-), E(✓)  
  - E is confirmed at position 5.  
  - T is in the word but **not** at position 2.  
  - L is in the word but **not** at position 4.  
  - S and O are **not** in the word.  

### Key Constraints for the Next Guess:

- The guess should prioritize:
