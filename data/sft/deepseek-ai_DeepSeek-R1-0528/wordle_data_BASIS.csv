We are starting a new game. Since it's the first guess, I don't have any feedback to choose from.
 I want to choose a word that is likely to give me a lot of information. A good starting word should:
  - Have common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.
  - Have a good mix of vowels and consonants.
  - Avoid repeated letters to maximize information.

 Some popular starting words in Wordle are: 
   ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""SALET"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"". It has the vowels 'A' and 'E' and common consonants 'C', 'R', 'N'. It doesn't repeat any letters.

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE

First, the previous guess was ""crane"" and the feedback was:

- C: x (not in the word)

- R: x (not in the word)

- A: - (in the word but wrong position)

- N: x (not in the word)

- E: x (not in the word)

From the feedback, I know that:

1. The letter A is in the secret word, but it's not in the second position (since in ""crane"", A is the third letter, position 2 if we start counting from 0, but positions are absolute). I should think in terms of the position in the word.

In ""crane"":

- Position 1: C

- Position 2: R

- Position 3: A

- Position 4: N

- Position 5: E

Feedback: C (pos1) x, R (pos2) x, A (pos3) -, N (pos4) x, E (pos5) x

So:

- A is in the secret word, but not at position 3.

- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in position 3, and the word does not contain C, R, N, or E.

I need to make a new guess of a 5-letter word that:

- Does not include C, R, N, E (since they are ruled out)

- Includes A, but not in position 3.

- I should choose a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters to test more possibilities.

Available letters: Since C, R, N, E are out, I need to avoid those.

Vowels: A is in, but E is out. Other vowels: I, O, U. Sometimes Y, but usually not a vowel in this context unless specified.

In Wordle, Y can be used as a vowel or consonant, but since E is out, and A is in, I should consider other vowels.

Consonants: Many options, but avoid C, R, N.

Common consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, B, etc.

My next guess should aim to find the position of A and discover other letters.

A is mispositioned, so it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since not position 3).

But position 1: if A were at position 1, but in the previous feedback, it wasn't correct, but since we had a -, it's not at pos3.

I should try to place A in a different position.

Also, since many letters are out, I can focus on words with A and other common letters.

Let me think of potential words that contain A but not C, R, N, E.

For example:

- Words with A in position 1: like ""APPLE"", but has E, which is out.

E is out, so no words with E.

- ""ALIGN"" but has N, out.

- ""AUDIO"" but has U, D, I, O – no forbidden letters except E,R,C,N are out, but U,D,I,O should be fine.

""AUDIO"" has no C,R,N,E? Let's check: A,U,D,I,O – all seem ok, but it has O, which might be good to test.

But A would be in position 1, which might be possible.

Since A is not at position 3, I could place it somewhere else.

Another idea: since A is the only letter I know is in, I should guess a word with A in position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5.

But I need to cover multiple possibilities.

Popular second guesses after feedback.

Since several letters are out, I can use a word that includes vowels I,O,U and consonants like T,S,L,D.

For instance, ""SAULT"" or something, but not a word.

Common words: ""PILOT"", but has no A. I need to include A.

Perhaps ""PLAIT"" – but let's see.

""TABLE"" – but has E, which is out.

E is out, so no E.

So no words containing E.

Also no C, R, N.

So possible letters: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but Q might be rare, etc.)

I should avoid rare letters.

A word like ""SALAD"" but has D and L, but it has A at position 1 and 4? Positions: S,A,L,A,D – so A at 2 and 4.

But I can guess it.

""SHALT"" not common.

""PLANT"" has N, out.

N is out.

Better: ""PASTA"" – P,A,S,T,A – but A at position 2 and 5.

Or ""PAINT"" has N, out.

""MAILS"" – M,A,I,L,S – A at position 2.

This has no forbidden letters.

Similarly, ""DAILY"" – D,A,I,L,Y – A at position 2.

But D,A,I,L,Y are all possible.

Perhaps choose a word to test common consonants.

Since A is the only known letter, I need to find where it is.

If I place A in a different position, say position 1, I can see if it's correct or not.

For example: guess a word with A in position 1.

Possible words: ""ABOUT"", ""AFTER"", but AFTER has E and R, both out? R is out, yes.

R is out.

""ABOUT"" – A,B,O,U,T – letters: A,B,O,U,T – none are forbidden? C,R,N,E are out, B,O,U,T are fine.

Similarly, ""ADMIT"" – A,D,M,I,T – also fine.

""AUDIO"" as I thought earlier.

""AUDIO"" is a word, A,U,D,I,O.

Positions: 1:A, 2:U, 3:D, 4:I, 5:O

But A is in position 1.

If I guess this, and A is not at position 1, I might get a - or something, but at least I'll know if it's at 1 or elsewhere.

Similarly, if it is at 1, I get ✓ for A at pos1.

A could be at other positions.

To maximize information, I might guess a word where A is not at position 3, and also include other vowels or consonants.

Another idea: since in ""crane"", position 3 was A but wrong position, I should avoid position 3 for A in the next guess.

In the feedback, A is in the word but not at pos3, so for my next guess, I can try A in position 1,2,4, or 5.

Let's list some candidate words:

- ""ABOUT"" : positions, A at 1

- ""ALONG"" : A at 1, L,O,N,G – but N is out, so no.

- ""APART"" : A at 1, P,A,R,T – R is out, no.

- ""ATOMS"" : A at 1, T,O,M,S – all ok? T,O,M,S are allowed.

- ""BLAST"" : B,L,A,S,T – A at position 3, but I'm not supposed to put it at position 3 because it might be wrong, but I can, but since it was wrong before, putting it at pos3 might not be useful, but it could be that it's still not there.

The position matters. When I put A at pos3, I got -, meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So if I put A at pos3 again, I might get x if it's not there, or - if it's moved, but I know it's not at pos3, so I should avoid pos3 for A.

Yes, so I should not put A at position 3 in the next guess.

Similarly, I can choose to put it in a new position.

Possible positions for A: 1,2,4,5.

Now, guess a word with A in one of these positions and new letters.

Also, I should test other vowels like I,O,U since E is out.

Consonants like S,T,L,D,M,P,B,G,K,H, etc.

Let me think of ""STAIR"" but has R, out.

No R.

""MAUVE"" has E, out.

No E.

""PILOT"" no A.

I need a word with A.

How about ""PLAID""? P,L,A,I,D – A at position 3? Position: P1, L2, A3, I4, D5. But if A at pos3, and it wasn't correct before, I should avoid pos3.

So ""PLAID"" has A at pos3, not good.

""FLAIL"" – F,L,A,I,L – A at pos3, again.

""QUAIL"" – Q might be rare, and A at pos3? Q,U,A,I,L – pos3 A.

Bad.

""ALIBI"" – A,L,I,B,I – A at position 1.

Letters: A,L,I,B – all allowed.

""ALIGN"" has N, out.

""ADAPT"" has P and T, but A at pos1.

""ADOPT"" same, O,P,T.

But no A required elsewhere.

"" DAISY"" – D,A,I,S,Y – A at position 2.

Good.

""BASIL"" – B,A,S,I,L – A at position 2.

Also good.

I could use ""SLATE"" but has E, out.

No E.

Another option: ""TOADY"" – T,O,A,D,Y – A at position 3? Positions: T1,O2,A3,D4,Y5 – but position 3 for A, which I should avoid.

Better to have A not at 3.

So words like ""PATIO"" – P,A,T,I,O – A at position 2.

Yes.

""RADIO"" has R, out.

R is out.

So ""PATIO"" : P,A,T,I,O – A at pos2.

Or ""TAKI"" not 5 letters.

""MANIA"" has N, out.

""OPT"" no.

I like ""ABOUT"": A at pos1, B,O,U,T – new letters.

""ADIOS"" – A,D,I,O,S – A at pos1.

Both fine.

Which one to choose.

Generally, S, T, L are very common consonants, so I might include them.

For example, ""PASTA"" – P,A,S,T,A – but positions: P1,A2,S3,T4,A5 – so A at pos2 and pos5.

I have two A's, which might be possible.

But in the secret word, it could have double letters, though not common.

Since feedback didn't indicate multiple, but from the previous feedback, A was mentioned once, which could mean one or more, but we don't know.

In the feedback, it's per letter instance, so in ""crane"" only one A, and it said -, so at least one A in word.

It could have more than one.

For my guess, ""PASTA"" has A at pos2 and pos5.

If I guess this, and for pos2 A, if it's correct I get ✓, else - , similarly for pos5.

Also, S and T at 3 and 4.

But S at pos3, T at pos4.

I need to decide.

With current knowledge, I should choose a word that covers more ground.

Perhaps ""ABOUT"" to test A at pos1 and introduce B,O,U,T.

Or ""DAISY"" for D,A,I,S,Y with A at pos2.

"" DAYIL"" not a word.

""HASTY"" H,A,S,T,Y – A at pos2.

"" FAST"" not 5.

I think ""SALAD"" is a word: S,A,L,A,D – A at pos2 and pos4.

Positions: 1S,2A,3L,4A,5D.

So A at 2 and 4.

When guessing, if A is at pos2, I might get ✓ or -, similarly for pos4.

But pos3 is L, not A.

I think ""SALAD"" is ok, but let's see if there's better.

Another common approach is to use words with high-frequency remaining letters.

Letters not yet tested: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,S,T,U,V,W,Y,Z (avoiding C,E,N,R and A is known in but position unknown)

Frequency in English: E is out, T is very common, A is in, O is common, I common, etc.

Top consonants: T, S, L, D, M, etc., since R and N are out.

Vowels: O, I, U.

So a word like ""POINT"" but has N, out.

""MOIST"" M,O,I,S,T – no A.

Need A.

""TOPAZ"" T,O,P,A,Z – A at pos4.

Letters ok.

""KOALA"" K,O,A,L,A – A at pos3 and pos5? Pos1:K,2:O,3:A,4:L,5:A – A at 3 and 5.

But I should avoid putting A at pos3, so not good.

Perhaps ""ASHED"" but has E, out.

No E.

""AVA G"" not a word.

I think ""ABOUT"" is a solid choice: A at pos1, B,O,U,T new.

""ADIEU"" has E and D,I,U, E is out.

Not.

""OASIS"" O,A,S,I,S – A at pos2, but has double S, might not be efficient.

""BASIC"" has C, out.

C is out.

Let me go with ""ABOUT"" for this guess.

So guess: A B O U T

Positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T

If A is at position 1, it could be correct; if not, it might show - or x, but since we know A is in word, if not at pos1, I'd get -.

Similarly, I test O,U,T,B.

O and U are vowels, B and T consonants.

T is very common.

U is less common, but ok.

Another option: ""AUDIO"" A,U,D,I,O – A at1, U at2, D at3, I at4, O at5. This has three vowels I,O,U, which might not give much consonant information.

Whereas ""ABOUT"" has T, which is good.

"" SALTY"" but has L,T,Y, no A? S,A,L,T,Y – yes A at pos2.

"" SALTY"" : S1,A2,L3,T4,Y5

A at pos2.

Then S,L,T,Y.

S and T are common.

L is common.

I think ""SALTY"" or ""ABOUT"" both ok.

Since A is likely not the first letter in many words, but I don't know.

Perhaps ""PATIO"" P,A,T,I,O – A at pos2, P,T,I,O.

T and O common.

I think I'll go with ""ABOUT"" for simplicity.

But let me confirm the word.

""ABOUT"" is a 5-letter word, yes.

C, R, N, E are excluded, and A is in.

So, my guess is ""about"".
</think>
<thought>
Previous feedback for guess ""crane"" was: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
This means:
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (since it was marked with ""-"" at position 3 in ""crane"").

For the next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter English word without C, R, N, or E.
- Must include A, but not in position 3 (to avoid repeating a position we know is incorrect).
- Positions for A could be 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- I should prioritize common letters not yet tested to gather more information, such as B, O, U, T, S, L, D, etc.

Possible candidates:
- ""ABOUT"": Places A at position 1, tests B, O, U, T. Common letters, and avoids position 3 for A.
- ""SALTY"": Places A at position 2, tests S, L, T, Y. Avoids position 3 and uses common consonants.
- ""PATIO"": Places A at position 2, tests P, T, I, O. Good vowel/consonant mix.

""ABOUT"" is a strong choice because:
- It tests A at a new position (1).
- Includes high-frequency letters like T and O.
- Avoids vowels E (excluded) and focuses on U, which is less tested.

Thus, ""about"" is a valid guess that builds on the feedback efficiently.

So:

""SHALT"" not common.

If I guess this, and A is not at position 1, I might get a - or something, but at least I'll know if it's at 1 or elsewhere.

Similarly, if it is at 1, I get ✓ for A at pos1.

A could be at other positions.

To maximize information, I might guess a word where A is not at position 3, and also include other vowels or consonants.

Another idea: since in ""crane"", position 3 was A but wrong position, I should avoid position 3 for A in the next guess.

In the feedback, A is in the word but not at pos3, so for my next guess, I can try A in position 1,2,4, or 5.

Let's list some candidate words:

- ""ABOUT"" : positions, A at 1

- ""ALONG"" : A at 1, L,O,N,G – but N is out, so no.

- ""APART"" : A at 1, P,A,R,T – R is out, no.

- ""ATOMS"" : A at 1, T,O,M,S – all ok? T,O,M,S are allowed.

- ""BLAST"" : B,L,A,S,T – A at position 3, but I'm not supposed to put it at position 3 because it might be wrong, but I can, but since it was wrong before, putting it at pos3 might not be useful, but it could be that it's still not there.

The position matters. When I put A at pos3, I got -, meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So if I put A at pos3 again, I might get x if it's not there, or - if it's moved, but I know it's not at pos3, so I should avoid pos3 for A.

Yes, so I should not put A at position 3 in the next guess.

Similarly, I can choose to put it in a new position.

Possible positions for A: 1,2,4,5.

Now, guess a word with A in one of these positions and new letters.

Also, I should test other vowels like I,O,U since E is out.

Consonants like S,T,L,D,M,P,B,G,K,H, etc.

Let me think of ""STAIR"" but has R, out.

No R.

""MAUVE"" has E, out.

No E.

""PILOT"" no A.

I need a word with A.

How about ""PLAID""? P,L,A,I,D – A at position 3? Position: P1, L2, A3, I4, D5. But if A at pos3, and it wasn't correct before, I should avoid pos3.

So ""PLAID"" has A at pos3, not good.

""FLAIL"" – F,L,A,I,L – A at pos3, again.

""QUAIL"" – Q might be rare, and A at pos3? Q,U,A,I,L – pos3 A.

Bad.

""ALIBI"" – A,L,I,B,I – A at position 1.

Letters: A,L,I,B – all allowed.

""ALIGN"" has N, out.

""ADAPT"" has P and T, but A at pos1.

""ADOPT"" same, O,P,T.

But no A required elsewhere.

"" DAISY"" – D,A,I,S,Y – A at position 2.

Good.

""BASIL"" – B,A,S,I,L – A at position 2.

Also good.

I could use ""SLATE"" but has E, out.

No E.

Another option: ""TOADY"" – T,O,A,D,Y – A at position 3? Positions: T1,O2,A3,D4,Y5 – but position 3 for A, which I should avoid.

Better to have A not at 3.

So words like ""PATIO"" – P,A,T,I,O – A at position 2.

Yes.

""RADIO"" has R, out.

R is out.

So ""PATIO"" : P,A,T,I,O – A at pos2.

Or ""TAKI"" not 5 letters.

""MANIA"" has N, out.

""OPT"" no.

I like ""ABOUT"": A at pos1, B,O,U,T – new letters.

""ADIOS"" – A,D,I,O,S – A at pos1.

Both fine.

Which one to choose.

Generally, S, T, L are very common consonants, so I might include them.

For example, ""PASTA"" – P,A,S,T,A – but positions: P1,A2,S3,T4,A5 – so A at pos2 and pos5.

I have two A's, which might be possible.

But in the secret word, it could have double letters, though not common.

Since feedback didn't indicate multiple, but from the previous feedback, A was mentioned once, which could mean one or more, but we don't know.

In the feedback, it's per letter instance, so in ""crane"" only one A, and it said -, so at least one A in word.

It could have more than one.

For my guess, ""PASTA"" has A at pos2 and pos5.

If I guess this, and for pos2 A, if it's correct I get ✓, else - , similarly for pos5.

Also, S and T at 3 and 4.

But S at pos3, T at pos4.

I need to decide.

With current knowledge, I should choose a word that covers more ground.

Perhaps ""ABOUT"" to test A at pos1 and introduce B,O,U,T.

Or ""DAISY"" for D,A,I,S,Y with A at pos2.

"" DAYIL"" not a word.

""HASTY"" H,A,S,T,Y – A at pos2.

"" FAST"" not 5.

I think ""SALAD"" is a word: S,A,L,A,D – A at pos2 and pos4.

Positions: 1S,2A,3L,4A,5D.

So A at 2 and 4.

When guessing, if A is at pos2, I might get ✓ or -, similarly for pos4.

But pos3 is L, not A.

I think ""SALAD"" is ok, but let's see if there's better.

Another common approach is to use words with high-frequency remaining letters.

Letters not yet tested: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,S,T,U,V,W,Y,Z (avoiding C,E,N,R and A is known in but position unknown)

Frequency in English: E is out, T is very common, A is in, O is common, I common, etc.

Top consonants: T, S, L, D, M, etc., since R and N are out.

Vowels: O, I, U.

So a word like ""POINT"" but has N, out.

""MOIST"" M,O,I,S,T – no A.

Need A.

""TOPAZ"" T,O,P,A,Z – A at pos4.

Letters ok.

""KOALA"" K,O,A,L,A – A at pos3 and pos5? Pos1:K,2:O,3:A,4:L,5:A – A at 3 and 5.

But I should avoid putting A at pos3, so not good.

Perhaps ""ASHED"" but has E, out.

No E.

""AVA G"" not a word.

I think ""ABOUT"" is a solid choice: A at pos1, B,O,U,T new.

""ADIEU"" has E and D,I,U, E is out.

Not.

""OASIS"" O,A,S,I,S – A at pos2, but has double S, might not be efficient.

""BASIC"" has C, out.

C is out.

Let me go with ""ABOUT"" for this guess.

So guess: A B O U T

Positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T

If A is at position 1, it could be correct; if not, it might show - or x, but since we know A is in word, if not at pos1, I'd get -.

Similarly, I test O,U,T,B.

O and U are vowels, B and T consonants.

T is very common.

U is less common, but ok.

Another option: ""AUDIO"" A,U,D,I,O – A at1, U at2, D at3, I at4, O at5. This has three vowels I,O,U, which might not give much consonant information.

Whereas ""ABOUT"" has T, which is good.

"" SALTY"" but has L,T,Y, no A? S,A,L,T,Y – yes A at pos2.

"" SALTY"" : S1,A2,L3,T4,Y5

A at pos2.

Then S,L,T,Y.

S and T are common.

L is common.

I think ""SALTY"" or ""ABOUT"" both ok.

Since A is likely not the first letter in many words, but I don't know.

Perhaps ""PATIO"" P,A,T,I,O – A at pos2, P,T,I,O.

T and O common.

I think I'll go with ""ABOUT"" for simplicity.

But let me confirm the word.

""ABOUT"" is a 5-letter word, yes.

C, R, N, E are excluded, and A is in.

So, my guess is ""about"".<thought>
Previous feedback for guess ""crane"" was: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
This means:
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (since it was marked with ""-"" at position 3 in ""crane"").

For the next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter English word without C, R, N, or E.
- Must include A, but not in position 3 (to avoid repeating a position we know is incorrect).
- Positions for A could be 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- I should prioritize common letters not yet tested to gather more information, such as B, O, U, T, S, L, D, etc.

Possible candidates:
- ""ABOUT"": Places A at position 1, tests B, O, U, T. Common letters, and avoids position 3 for A.
- ""SALTY"": Places A at position 2, tests S, L, T, Y. Avoids position 3 and uses common consonants.
- ""PATIO"": Places A at position 2, tests P, T, I, O. Good vowel/consonant mix.

""ABOUT"" is a strong choice because:
- It tests A at a new position (1).
- Includes high-frequency letters like T and O.
- Avoids vowels E (excluded) and focuses on U, which is less tested.

Thus, ""about"" is a valid guess that builds on the feedback efficiently.
</thought>",Guess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(-) O(x) U(x) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,BASIS,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. Since it's the first guess, I don't have any feedback to choose from.
 I want to choose a word that is likely to give me a lot of information. A good starting word should:
  - Have common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.
  - Have a good mix of vowels and consonants.
  - Avoid repeated letters to maximize information.

 Some popular starting words in Wordle are: 
   ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""SALET"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"". It has the vowels 'A' and 'E' and common consonants 'C', 'R', 'N'. It doesn't repeat any letters.

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>First, the previous guess was ""crane"" and the feedback was:

- C: x (not in the word)

- R: x (not in the word)

- A: - (in the word but wrong position)

- N: x (not in the word)

- E: x (not in the word)

From the feedback, I know that:

1. The letter A is in the secret word, but it's not in the second position (since in ""crane"", A is the third letter, position 2 if we start counting from 0, but positions are absolute). I should think in terms of the position in the word.

In ""crane"":

- Position 1: C

- Position 2: R

- Position 3: A

- Position 4: N

- Position 5: E

Feedback: C (pos1) x, R (pos2) x, A (pos3) -, N (pos4) x, E (pos5) x

So:

- A is in the secret word, but not at position 3.

- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in position 3, and the word does not contain C, R, N, or E.

I need to make a new guess of a 5-letter word that:

- Does not include C, R, N, E (since they are ruled out)

- Includes A, but not in position 3.

- I should choose a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters to test more possibilities.

Available letters: Since C, R, N, E are out, I need to avoid those.

Vowels: A is in, but E is out. Other vowels: I, O, U. Sometimes Y, but usually not a vowel in this context unless specified.

In Wordle, Y can be used as a vowel or consonant, but since E is out, and A is in, I should consider other vowels.

Consonants: Many options, but avoid C, R, N.

Common consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, B, etc.

My next guess should aim to find the position of A and discover other letters.

A is mispositioned, so it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since not position 3).

But position 1: if A were at position 1, but in the previous feedback, it wasn't correct, but since we had a -, it's not at pos3.

I should try to place A in a different position.

Also, since many letters are out, I can focus on words with A and other common letters.

Let me think of potential words that contain A but not C, R, N, E.

For example:

- Words with A in position 1: like ""APPLE"", but has E, which is out.

E is out, so no words with E.

- ""ALIGN"" but has N, out.

- ""AUDIO"" but has U, D, I, O – no forbidden letters except E,R,C,N are out, but U,D,I,O should be fine.

""AUDIO"" has no C,R,N,E? Let's check: A,U,D,I,O – all seem ok, but it has O, which might be good to test.

But A would be in position 1, which might be possible.

Since A is not at position 3, I could place it somewhere else.

Another idea: since A is the only letter I know is in, I should guess a word with A in position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5.

But I need to cover multiple possibilities.

Popular second guesses after feedback.

Since several letters are out, I can use a word that includes vowels I,O,U and consonants like T,S,L,D.

For instance, ""SAULT"" or something, but not a word.

Common words: ""PILOT"", but has no A. I need to include A.

Perhaps ""PLAIT"" – but let's see.

""TABLE"" – but has E, which is out.

E is out, so no E.

So no words containing E.

Also no C, R, N.

So possible letters: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but Q might be rare, etc.)

I should avoid rare letters.

A word like ""SALAD"" but has D and L, but it has A at position 1 and 4? Positions: S,A,L,A,D – so A at 2 and 4.

But I can guess it.

""SHALT"" not common.

""PLANT"" has N, out.

N is out.

Better: ""PASTA"" – P,A,S,T,A – but A at position 2 and 5.

Or ""PAINT"" has N, out.

""MAILS"" – M,A,I,L,S – A at position 2.

This has no forbidden letters.

Similarly, ""DAILY"" – D,A,I,L,Y – A at position 2.

But D,A,I,L,Y are all possible.

Perhaps choose a word to test common consonants.

Since A is the only known letter, I need to find where it is.

If I place A in a different position, say position 1, I can see if it's correct or not.

For example: guess a word with A in position 1.

Possible words: ""ABOUT"", ""AFTER"", but AFTER has E and R, both out? R is out, yes.

R is out.

""ABOUT"" – A,B,O,U,T – letters: A,B,O,U,T – none are forbidden? C,R,N,E are out, B,O,U,T are fine.

Similarly, ""ADMIT"" – A,D,M,I,T – also fine.

""AUDIO"" as I thought earlier.

""AUDIO"" is a word, A,U,D,I,O.

Positions: 1:A, 2:U, 3:D, 4:I, 5:O

But A is in position 1.

If I guess this, and A is not at position 1, I might get a - or something, but at least I'll know if it's at 1 or elsewhere.

Similarly, if it is at 1, I get ✓ for A at pos1.

A could be at other positions.

To maximize information, I might guess a word where A is not at position 3, and also include other vowels or consonants.

Another idea: since in ""crane"", position 3 was A but wrong position, I should avoid position 3 for A in the next guess.

In the feedback, A is in the word but not at pos3, so for my next guess, I can try A in position 1,2,4, or 5.

Let's list some candidate words:

- ""ABOUT"" : positions, A at 1

- ""ALONG"" : A at 1, L,O,N,G – but N is out, so no.

- ""APART"" : A at 1, P,A,R,T – R is out, no.

- ""ATOMS"" : A at 1, T,O,M,S – all ok? T,O,M,S are allowed.

- ""BLAST"" : B,L,A,S,T – A at position 3, but I'm not supposed to put it at position 3 because it might be wrong, but I can, but since it was wrong before, putting it at pos3 might not be useful, but it could be that it's still not there.

The position matters. When I put A at pos3, I got -, meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So if I put A at pos3 again, I might get x if it's not there, or - if it's moved, but I know it's not at pos3, so I should avoid pos3 for A.

Yes, so I should not put A at position 3 in the next guess.

Similarly, I can choose to put it in a new position.

Possible positions for A: 1,2,4,5.

Now, guess a word with A in one of these positions and new letters.

Also, I should test other vowels like I,O,U since E is out.

Consonants like S,T,L,D,M,P,B,G,K,H, etc.

Let me think of ""STAIR"" but has R, out.

No R.

""MAUVE"" has E, out.

No E.

""PILOT"" no A.

I need a word with A.

How about ""PLAID""? P,L,A,I,D – A at position 3? Position: P1, L2, A3, I4, D5. But if A at pos3, and it wasn't correct before, I should avoid pos3.

So ""PLAID"" has A at pos3, not good.

""FLAIL"" – F,L,A,I,L – A at pos3, again.

""QUAIL"" – Q might be rare, and A at pos3? Q,U,A,I,L – pos3 A.

Bad.

""ALIBI"" – A,L,I,B,I – A at position 1.

Letters: A,L,I,B – all allowed.

""ALIGN"" has N, out.

""ADAPT"" has P and T, but A at pos1.

""ADOPT"" same, O,P,T.

But no A required elsewhere.

"" DAISY"" – D,A,I,S,Y – A at position 2.

Good.

""BASIL"" – B,A,S,I,L – A at position 2.

Also good.

I could use ""SLATE"" but has E, out.

No E.

Another option: ""TOADY"" – T,O,A,D,Y – A at position 3? Positions: T1,O2,A3,D4,Y5 – but position 3 for A, which I should avoid.

Better to have A not at 3.

So words like ""PATIO"" – P,A,T,I,O – A at position 2.

Yes.

""RADIO"" has R, out.

R is out.

So ""PATIO"" : P,A,T,I,O – A at pos2.

Or ""TAKI"" not 5 letters.

""MANIA"" has N, out.

""OPT"" no.

I like ""ABOUT"": A at pos1, B,O,U,T – new letters.

""ADIOS"" – A,D,I,O,S – A at pos1.

Both fine.

Which one to choose.

Generally, S, T, L are very common consonants, so I might include them.

For example, ""PASTA"" – P,A,S,T,A – but positions: P1,A2,S3,T4,A5 – so A at pos2 and pos5.

I have two A's, which might be possible.

But in the secret word, it could have double letters, though not common.

Since feedback didn't indicate multiple, but from the previous feedback, A was mentioned once, which could mean one or more, but we don't know.

In the feedback, it's per letter instance, so in ""crane"" only one A, and it said -, so at least one A in word.

It could have more than one.

For my guess, ""PASTA"" has A at pos2 and pos5.

If I guess this, and for pos2 A, if it's correct I get ✓, else - , similarly for pos5.

Also, S and T at 3 and 4.

But S at pos3, T at pos4.

I need to decide.

With current knowledge, I should choose a word that covers more ground.

Perhaps ""ABOUT"" to test A at pos1 and introduce B,O,U,T.

Or ""DAISY"" for D,A,I,S,Y with A at pos2.

"" DAYIL"" not a word.

""HASTY"" H,A,S,T,Y – A at pos2.

"" FAST"" not 5.

I think ""SALAD"" is a word: S,A,L,A,D – A at pos2 and pos4.

Positions: 1S,2A,3L,4A,5D.

So A at 2 and 4.

When guessing, if A is at pos2, I might get ✓ or -, similarly for pos4.

But pos3 is L, not A.

I think ""SALAD"" is ok, but let's see if there's better.

Another common approach is to use words with high-frequency remaining letters.

Letters not yet tested: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,S,T,U,V,W,Y,Z (avoiding C,E,N,R and A is known in but position unknown)

Frequency in English: E is out, T is very common, A is in, O is common, I common, etc.

Top consonants: T, S, L, D, M, etc., since R and N are out.

Vowels: O, I, U.

So a word like ""POINT"" but has N, out.

""MOIST"" M,O,I,S,T – no A.

Need A.

""TOPAZ"" T,O,P,A,Z – A at pos4.

Letters ok.

""KOALA"" K,O,A,L,A – A at pos3 and pos5? Pos1:K,2:O,3:A,4:L,5:A – A at 3 and 5.

But I should avoid putting A at pos3, so not good.

Perhaps ""ASHED"" but has E, out.

No E.

""AVA G"" not a word.

I think ""ABOUT"" is a solid choice: A at pos1, B,O,U,T new.

""ADIEU"" has E and D,I,U, E is out.

Not.

""OASIS"" O,A,S,I,S – A at pos2, but has double S, might not be efficient.

""BASIC"" has C, out.

C is out.

Let me go with ""ABOUT"" for this guess.

So guess: A B O U T

Positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T

If A is at position 1, it could be correct; if not, it might show - or x, but since we know A is in word, if not at pos1, I'd get -.

Similarly, I test O,U,T,B.

O and U are vowels, B and T consonants.

T is very common.

U is less common, but ok.

Another option: ""AUDIO"" A,U,D,I,O – A at1, U at2, D at3, I at4, O at5. This has three vowels I,O,U, which might not give much consonant information.

Whereas ""ABOUT"" has T, which is good.

"" SALTY"" but has L,T,Y, no A? S,A,L,T,Y – yes A at pos2.

"" SALTY"" : S1,A2,L3,T4,Y5

A at pos2.

Then S,L,T,Y.

S and T are common.

L is common.

I think ""SALTY"" or ""ABOUT"" both ok.

Since A is likely not the first letter in many words, but I don't know.

Perhaps ""PATIO"" P,A,T,I,O – A at pos2, P,T,I,O.

T and O common.

I think I'll go with ""ABOUT"" for simplicity.

But let me confirm the word.

""ABOUT"" is a 5-letter word, yes.

C, R, N, E are excluded, and A is in.

So, my guess is ""about"".<thought>
Previous feedback for guess ""crane"" was: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
This means:
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (since it was marked with ""-"" at position 3 in ""crane"").

For the next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter English word without C, R, N, or E.
- Must include A, but not in position 3 (to avoid repeating a position we know is incorrect).
- Positions for A could be 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- I should prioritize common letters not yet tested to gather more information, such as B, O, U, T, S, L, D, etc.

Possible candidates:
- ""ABOUT"": Places A at position 1, tests B, O, U, T. Common letters, and avoids position 3 for A.
- ""SALTY"": Places A at position 2, tests S, L, T, Y. Avoids position 3 and uses common consonants.
- ""PATIO"": Places A at position 2, tests P, T, I, O. Good vowel/consonant mix.

""ABOUT"" is a strong choice because:
- It tests A at a new position (1).
- Includes high-frequency letters like T and O.
- Avoids vowels E (excluded) and focuses on U, which is less tested.

Thus, ""about"" is a valid guess that builds on the feedback efficiently.

T,O,M,S are allowed.\n\n- ""BLAST"" : B,L,A,S,T – A at position 3, but I\'m not supposed to put it at position 3 because it might be wrong, but I can, but since it was wrong before, putting it at pos3 might not be useful, but it could be that it\'s still not there.\n\nThe position matters. When I put A at pos3, I got -, meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So if I put A at pos3 again, I might get x if it\'s not there, or - if it\'s moved, but I know it\'s not at pos3, so I should avoid pos3 for A.\n\nYes, so I should not put A at position 3 in the next guess.\n\nSimilarly, I can choose to put it in a new position.\n\nPossible positions for A: 1,2,4,5.\n\nNow, guess a word with A in one of these positions and new letters.\n\nAlso, I should test other vowels like I,O,U since E is out.\n\nConsonants like S,T,L,D,M,P,B,G,K,H, etc.\n\nLet me think of ""STAIR"" but has R, out.\n\nNo R.\n\n""MAUVE"" has E, out.\n\nNo E.\n\n""PILOT"" no A.\n\nI need a word with A.\n\nHow about ""PLAID""? P,L,A,I,D – A at position 3? Position: P1, L2, A3, I4, D5.

Q,U,A,I,L – pos3 A.\n\nBad.\n\n""ALIBI"" – A,L,I,B,I – A at position 1.\n\nLetters: A,L,I,B – all allowed.\n\n""ALIGN"" has N, out.\n\n""ADAPT"" has P and T, but A at pos1.\n\n""ADOPT"" same, O,P,T.\n\nBut no A required elsewhere.\n\n"" DAISY"" – D,A,I,S,Y – A at position 2.\n\nGood.\n\n""BASIL"" – B,A,S,I,L – A at position 2.\n\nAlso good.\n\nI could use ""SLATE"" but has E, out.\n\nNo E.\n\nAnother option: ""TOADY"" – T,O,A,D,Y – A at position 3? Positions: T1,O2,A3,D4,Y5 – but position 3 for A, which I should avoid.\n\nBetter to have A not at 3.\n\nSo words like ""PATIO"" – P,A,T,I,O – A at position 2.\n\nYes.\n\n""RADIO"" has R, out.\n\nR is out.\n\nSo ""PATIO"" : P,A,T,I,O – A at pos2.\n\nOr ""TAKI"" not 5 letters.\n\n""MANIA"" has N, out.\n\n""OPT"" no.\n\nI like ""ABOUT"": A at pos1, B,O,U,T – new letters.\n\n""ADIOS"" – A,D,I,O,S – A at pos1.\n\nBoth fine.\n\nWhich one to choose.\n\nGenerally, S, T, L are very common consonants, so I might include them.\n\nFor example, ""PASTA"" – P,A,S,T,A – but positions: P1,A2,S3,T4,A5 – so A at pos2 and pos5.\n\nI have two A\'s, which might be possible.\n\nBut in the secret word, it could have double letters, though not common.\n\nSince feedback didn\'t indicate multiple, but from the previous feedback, A was mentioned once, which could mean one or more, but we don\'t know.\n\nIn the feedback, it\'s per letter instance, so in ""crane"" only one A, and it said -, so at least one A in word.\n\nIt could have more than one.\n\nFor my guess, ""PASTA"" has A at pos2 and pos5.\n\nIf I guess this, and for pos2 A, if it\'s correct I get ✓, else - , similarly for pos5.\n\nAlso, S and T at 3 and 4.\n\nBut S at pos3, T at pos4.\n\nI need to decide.\n\nWith current knowledge, I should choose a word that covers more ground.\n\nPerhaps ""ABOUT"" to test A at pos1 and introduce B,O,U,T.\n\nOr ""DAISY"" for D,A,I,S,Y with A at pos2.\n\n"" DAYIL"" not a word.\n\n""HASTY"" H,A,S,T,Y – A at pos2.\n\n"" FAST"" not 5.\n\nI think ""SALAD"" is a word: S,A,L,A,D – A at pos2 and pos4.\n\nPositions: 1S,2A,3L,4A,5D.\n\nSo A at 2 and 4.\n\nWhen guessing, if A is at pos2, I might get ✓ or -, similarly for pos4.\n\nBut pos3 is L, not A.\n\nI think ""SALAD"" is ok, but let\'s see if there\'s better.\n\nAnother common approach is to use words with high-frequency remaining letters.\n\nLetters not yet tested: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,S,T,U,V,W,Y,Z (avoiding C,E,N,R and A is known in but position unknown)\n\nFrequency in English: E is out, T is very common, A is in, O is common, I common, etc.\n\nTop consonants: T, S, L, D, M, etc., since R and N are out.\n\nVowels: O, I, U.\n\nSo a word like ""POINT"" but has N, out.\n\n""MOIST"" M,O,I,S,T – no A.\n\nNeed A.\n\n""TOPAZ"" T,O,P,A,Z – A at pos4.\n\nLetters ok.\n\n""KOALA"" K,O,A,L,A – A at pos3 and pos5?

This has three vowels I,O,U, which might not give much consonant information.\n\nWhereas ""ABOUT"" has T, which is good.\n\n"" SALTY"" but has L,T,Y, no A? S,A,L,T,Y – yes A at pos2.\n\n"" SALTY"" : S1,A2,L3,T4,Y5\n\nA at pos2.\n\nThen S,L,T,Y.\n\nS and T are common.\n\nL is common.\n\nI think ""SALTY"" or ""ABOUT"" both ok.\n\nSince A is likely not the first letter in many words, but I don\'t know.\n\nPerhaps ""PATIO"" P,A,T,I,O – A at pos2, P,T,I,O.\n\nT and O common.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""ABOUT"" for simplicity.\n\nBut let me confirm the word.\n\n""ABOUT"" is a 5-letter word, yes.\n\nC, R, N, E are excluded, and A is in.\n\nSo, my guess is ""about"".<thought>\nPrevious feedback for guess ""crane"" was: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)\nThis means:\n- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.\n- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (since it was marked with ""-"" at position 3 in ""crane"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must be a 5-letter English word without C, R, N, or E.\n- Must include A, but not in position 3 (to avoid repeating a position we know is incorrect).\n- Positions for A could be 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n- I should prioritize common letters not yet tested to gather more information, such as B, O, U, T, S, L, D, etc.\n\nPossible candidates:\n- ""ABOUT"": Places A at position 1, tests B, O, U, T. Common letters, and avoids position 3 for A.\n- ""SALTY"": Places A at position 2, tests S, L, T, Y. Avoids position 3 and uses common consonants.\n- ""PATIO"": Places A at position 2, tests P, T, I, O. Good vowel/consonant mix.\n\n""ABOUT"" is a strong choice because:\n- It tests A at a new position (1).\n- Includes high-frequency letters like T and O.\n- Avoids vowels E (excluded) and focuses on U, which is less tested.\n\nThus, ""about"" is a valid guess that builds on the feedback efficiently.\n</thought>\n\n<guess>about</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(-) O(x) U(x) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are on guess 3 now. Previous guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Interpretation:
- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was at position 3 in ""crane"").

Guess 2: ""about"" → Feedback: A(-), B(-), O(x), U(x), T(x)
Interpretation:
- A is again marked with ""-"", meaning A is in the word but not in position 1 (since in ""about"", A is at position 1).
- B is marked with ""-"", meaning B is in the word but not in position 2.
- O, U, T are not in the word at all (marked ""x"").

So from feedback so far:
- Definitely NOT in the word: C, E, R, N, O, U, T (since they are marked ""x"").
- Present in the word: A and B.
- Positions: 
  - A is not at position 1 (from ""about"") and not at position 3 (from ""crane""). Therefore, A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
  - B is not at position 2 (from ""about""). B could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Since we know A and B are both in the word, and we have eliminations on O, U, T, etc., we have a reduced set of possible letters.

Additional constraints:
- The word must not contain C, E, R, N, O, U, T.
- Contained letters: A and B (at least these).

We need to think of a word that:
- Includes A and B (both and at least one instance each).
- A not in position 1 or 3 → so positions 2, 4, or 5 for A.
- B not in position 2 → so positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 for B.

Also, we should avoid other forbidden letters.

Possible letters to include: besides A and B, we can use D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, S, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc. However, we should focus on common letters.

Since we have limited guesses (this is the third guess), we want to maximize information about the remaining positions.

Strategy:
- We know A must be in 2,4,5 and B in 1,3,4,5. Note that if B is in position 1, that's the only way it can be there since position 2 is prohibited for B. Similarly, for A, position 2 is now possible.

Possible positions for A: let's denote the secret word as _ _ _ _ _

- Position 2: if we place A there, it could be correct.
- Position 4 or 5: similar.

But we need to include B as well.

Moreover, we want to test new common letters.

Consider guessing a word where:
- A is placed at position 2 (since we haven't tested position 2 yet) and B at a new position (say position 1 or 3 or 4, but position 1 is allowed for B).

But B cannot be at position 2? Yes, but position 2 is for A if we place it there.

Alternatively, place A at position 4 or 5 to test a different position.

To optimize, we should choose a word that has A in one of the allowed positions and B in another allowed position, and introduce new high-frequency consonants or vowels (like S, L, I, etc.).

Common letters not yet tested: S, L, D, M, P, I, etc.

For example, if we place A at position 2 and B at position 1, we get words like ""BA**A"" or something. But we need to fill with other letters.

Possible words:
- ""BAS**"" must include two more letters. For example, ""BASIL"" or ""BASIS"" or ""BASAL"". However, ""BASIL"": B,A,S,I,L → positions: B1, A2, S3, I4, L5. 
  - But we must avoid forbidden letters. L and I are allowed? Yes, as long as not in the forbidden list.

Forbidden letters so far: C,E,R,N,O,U,T. So I and L are ok.

Similarly, S is allowed.

But ""BASIL"": 
- Position 1: B (which is allowed since B not forbidden and position not 2 for B? Wait, no: B is prohibited from position 2? Not exactly: from feedback, B cannot be at position 2, but position 1 is allowed. And for A, position 2 is allowed.

So in ""BASIL"":
- B at position 1 → allowed? Yes, because position 1 is possible for B.
- A at position 2 → this is a possible position for A.

But we need to check if the word satisfies.

Another word: ""LAB A"" not, or ""BALSA"" → B,A,L,S,A → positions: B1,A2,L3,S4,A5? But double A, and A at position 2 and 5.

""BALSA"" is a word? Yes, meaning a type of wood.

But letters: B,A,L,S,A → A at pos2 and pos5.

In this case, for the first A at pos2, if it is correct or wrong position? But we know A is present.

Similarly, B at pos1.

The issue: we have L,S and possibly other.

But from constraints, A must be in 2,4,5: if we place A at pos2, that's fine. But we don't know yet.

We can choose such a word to test.

But maybe ""BASIC""? C is out, forbidden.

Not.

""BAILS"" B,A,I,L,S → similar to ""BASIL"" but ends with S.

""BAYLE"" E out? No E? ""BAYLS"" not a word, or ""BAILS"" is the plural form? Yes ""bails"", but might not be common; ""bails"" means something in cricket or law.

But let's stick with common words.

""ABYSM"" has S,M, but positions? A1,B2,Y,S,M—but A is at position 1? But position 1 is not allowed for A? From feedback: A is forbidden at position 1? Yes, from ""about"" feedback, A at position 1 was ""-"", meaning it is in word but not at pos1, so cannot be at pos1. So we cannot have A at position 1 anymore.

In ""ABYSM"", A is at position 1, which we know is wrong. We must avoid putting A at position 1 or 3.

Similarly, in our guess, we must avoid position 1 and 3 for A.

So back to words: if we want to test A at position 2, then position 2 must be A.

Then position 1 can be B? B is allowed at position 1.

So words with B at position 1 and A at position 2: e.g., ""BALMY"", but Y; ""BALED"" has E forbidden; ""BAGGY"" not 5 unique? But it can be.

"" BAULK"" or ""BAULK""? Not common; ""BAILS"" I mentioned earlier.

Perhaps ""BASIS"" B,A,S,I,S—has double S and I.

But I think ""BASIL"" is acceptable: B,A,S,I,L.

Letters: B,A,S,I,L.

All are not forbidden? S,I,L are allowed, yes.

Positions:
1: B
2: A
3: S
4: I
5: L

We know:
- Position 2: A—this could be correct or not; since we haven't tested position 2 for A before, if A is here, it might be correct; if not, we get ""-"" indicating wrong position.
- Position 1: B—similarly, B could be here or not; if here, it might be correct if position is right.

Also we test S,I,L.

Another possibility: place A at position 4 or 5.

For example, word with A at position 4: like "" P L A Y S "" but needs to include B.

""FLABS"" F,L,A,B,S → positions: F1,L2,A3,B4,S5—but A at position 3? Position 3 is forbidden for A? We know from first feedback A not at pos3. So cannot place A at pos3.

Similarly, only positions 2,4,5.

So if A at position 4:  ""**A**"" where first two letters are not A, last etc.

So with B: words like ""UMBRA"" but U is forbidden? No, U is out, forbidden.

Forbidden letters: C,E,R,N,O,U,T. So U not allowed.

Possible word with A at position 4 and B elsewhere: ""LABIA"" L,A,B,I,A—positions: L1,A2,B3,I4,A5—but here, A at position 2 and 5 and 5 again? And B at position 3. But position 2 for A is allowed.

In ""LABIA"", we have A at position 2, which is allowed, but we also place A at position 5? And B at position 3.

But we are testing multiple A positions at once? Might not be efficient.

Avoid putting A in a tested position unnecessarily.

Better to test one new position.

Since position 2 is available, and we haven't tested it, place A at position 2.

Similarly, for B, avoid position 2, which we know.

But position 1 for B is possible.

So ""BASIL"" seems reasonable.

Other words: ""CABAL"" but C forbidden.

Not.

""DA B B S"" D,A,B,B,S—double B? ""DA B S"" not.

""GA BB Y"" not.

I think ""BASIL"" is fine.

But let's consider if there's a word that has A at position 4 or 5 and B at another position, with new letters.

For example, A at position 4: ""SPLAT"" but P,L,A,T—T is forbidden? T was marked x in ""about"", so T out.

T is forbidden.

Similarly, O,U,T out.

So T forbidden.

Similarly, list forbidden: C,E,N,R,O,U,T.

So cannot use T.

Now S is available.

A at position 4: words like ""DELAY"" D,E—E out; not possible.

""D U A L"" U out.

""FLASK"" F,L,A,S,K—position: F1,L2,A3,S4,K5—but A at pos3? Forbidden. Cannot.

A at position 5: words like ""   I S B A"" so ending with A.

With B: ""CUR B A"" C,U not; ""BAR E A"" E; not.

""TUB A S"" T,U forbidden.

Difficult to find a word with B and A at position 5.

Perhaps place B at position 1 and A at position 4: ""B L A N K"" N forbidden; ""B E A M S"" E forbidden; ""B O A S T"" O,T forbidden.

""B K A S "" not word.

""BAS***"": with position 1 B, position 2 A, and then other letters.

So back to ""BASIL"".

Alternative: ""BASED"" has E forbidden.

""BASAL"" B,A,S,A,L—A at position 2 and 4? Positions: B1,A2,S3,A4,L5—so that tests A at position 2 and position 4? Might be acceptable.

""BASAL"" means relating to base.

Letters: B,A,S,A,L → so A at pos2 and pos4.

This could be useful: if A is at pos2, we might get ✓ or if at pos4, similarly.

But in one guess, we might get information on both positions.

Similarly, if neither, we still know A is present elsewhere.

But with one A, might be confusing, but we have the feedback per letter.

Since we know A is in word, and with two positions tested, we can see if any gets ✓ or both - etc.

For B, it's at position 1.

In ""BASAL"":
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: A (second instance)

If feedback gives:
- B at pos1 could be ✓ or - 
- A at pos2 could be correct if ✓ or - if elsewhere
- S at pos3: new, could be anything
- A at pos4: similarly might be ✓ or - or x? But A is in word, if the second A is not present, it would show ""-"" if position wrong or possibly ""x"" if duplicate? But feedback marks each occurrence separately.

Since the word has two A's, but if the secret word has only one A, one of the guesses might be marked wrong? Let's think.

For example, if secret word has A only once, say at position 4:

For ""BASAL"" guess:
- Pos1 B: if not in word, marked x; if in, ✓ or -
- Pos2 A: since A is not at pos2 (assuming in secret it's only at pos4), but A in word, so pos2 A should be ""-"" (wrong position)
- Pos3 S: unknown
- Pos4 A: correct position, so ""✓""
- Pos5 L: unknown

Similarly, other cases.

In ""BASAL"", we test A at positions 2 and 4, both possible.

I think ""BASIL"" might be better to avoid duplicate letters for simplicity, but ""BASAL"" is valid.

Another word: ""K A Y A K"" not 5? Or ""M A P S Y"" with A at pos2.

But let's choose.

Since we also want to test other consonants, S is crucial.

Also L in ""BASIL"".

Perhaps ""BASIS"" with S at end, but double S.

To maximize, I think ""BASIL"" is fine.

But B is already known, so testing new letters S,I,L might be good.

I will go with ""basil"".

But let's confirm it doesn't contain forbidden letters: B,A,S,I,L — none in C,E,R,N,O,U,T? Yes.

Positions: B1,A2,S3,I4,L5.

We haven't tested position 1 for B, position 2 for A, position 3 for S, etc., as requested.

This should give new information.

If A is at position 2, we might learn something straight.

Similarly for B at position 1.

Otherwise, we get feedback on positions.

So guess: ""basil"".

<thought>
Summary of feedback and deductions:
- Eliminated letters: C, E, R, N, O, U, T
- Confirmed letters: A and B
- Position constraints:
  - A is not at position 1 or 3 → must be at 2, 4, or 5
  - B is not at position 2 → must be at 1, 3, 4, or 5

For guess 3, we need a word containing A and B, avoiding forbidden letters.
- ""basil"" (B,A,S,I,L) satisfies:
  - Position 1: B → possible position for B (could be correct or wrong position)
  - Position 2: A → possible position for A (could be correct or wrong position)
  - Introduces new common letters S, I, L to test their presence and positions.
- Avoids positions that are forbidden (A not at 1 or 3, B not at 2).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of A and B and provide information on S, I, L.
</thought>

<guess>basil</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- Guess 1 (""crane""): A is in the word but not at position 3. C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- Guess 2 (""about""): A is in the word but not at position 1. B is in the word but not at position 2. O, U, T are not in the word.

Deductions:
- **A** must be at position 2, 4, or 5 (cannot be at 1 or 3).
- **B** must be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (cannot be at 2).
- **Excluded letters**: C, E, R, N, O, U, T (cannot appear).
- **Included letters**: A and B are confirmed present.
- Other letters must be from the remaining pool: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the next guess:
- The word must contain A and B.
- A should be placed at a new untested position (2, 4, or 5) to gather positional information.
- B should avoid position 2 and be placed elsewhere.
- New letters should be tested to maximize information; common letters like S, I, L are prioritized.

""basil"" (B, A, S, I, L) is chosen because:
- Positions: B (position 1), A (position 2), S (position 3), I (position 4), L (position 5).
- Tests A at position 2 (unverified position) and B at position 1 (unverified position).
- Introduces high-frequency letters S, I, L.
- Avoids all excluded letters and adheres to positional constraints.

<guess>basil</guess>",basil,"We are on guess 3 now. Previous guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Interpretation:
- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was at position 3 in ""crane"").

Guess 2: ""about"" → Feedback: A(-), B(-), O(x), U(x), T(x)
Interpretation:
- A is again marked with ""-"", meaning A is in the word but not in position 1 (since in ""about"", A is at position 1).
- B is marked with ""-"", meaning B is in the word but not in position 2.
- O, U, T are not in the word at all (marked ""x"").

So from feedback so far:
- Definitely NOT in the word: C, E, R, N, O, U, T (since they are marked ""x"").
- Present in the word: A and B.
- Positions: 
  - A is not at position 1 (from ""about"") and not at position 3 (from ""crane""). Therefore, A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
  - B is not at position 2 (from ""about""). B could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Since we know A and B are both in the word, and we have eliminations on O, U, T, etc., we have a reduced set of possible letters.

Additional constraints:
- The word must not contain C, E, R, N, O, U, T.
- Contained letters: A and B (at least these).

We need to think of a word that:
- Includes A and B (both and at least one instance each).
- A not in position 1 or 3 → so positions 2, 4, or 5 for A.
- B not in position 2 → so positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 for B.

Also, we should avoid other forbidden letters.

Possible letters to include: besides A and B, we can use D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, S, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc. However, we should focus on common letters.

Since we have limited guesses (this is the third guess), we want to maximize information about the remaining positions.

Strategy:
- We know A must be in 2,4,5 and B in 1,3,4,5. Note that if B is in position 1, that's the only way it can be there since position 2 is prohibited for B. Similarly, for A, position 2 is now possible.

Possible positions for A: let's denote the secret word as _ _ _ _ _

- Position 2: if we place A there, it could be correct.
- Position 4 or 5: similar.

But we need to include B as well.

Moreover, we want to test new common letters.

Consider guessing a word where:
- A is placed at position 2 (since we haven't tested position 2 yet) and B at a new position (say position 1 or 3 or 4, but position 1 is allowed for B).

But B cannot be at position 2? Yes, but position 2 is for A if we place it there.

Alternatively, place A at position 4 or 5 to test a different position.

To optimize, we should choose a word that has A in one of the allowed positions and B in another allowed position, and introduce new high-frequency consonants or vowels (like S, L, I, etc.).

Common letters not yet tested: S, L, D, M, P, I, etc.

For example, if we place A at position 2 and B at position 1, we get words like ""BA**A"" or something. But we need to fill with other letters.

Possible words:
- ""BAS**"" must include two more letters. For example, ""BASIL"" or ""BASIS"" or ""BASAL"". However, ""BASIL"": B,A,S,I,L → positions: B1, A2, S3, I4, L5. 
  - But we must avoid forbidden letters. L and I are allowed? Yes, as long as not in the forbidden list.

Forbidden letters so far: C,E,R,N,O,U,T. So I and L are ok.

Similarly, S is allowed.

But ""BASIL"": 
- Position 1: B (which is allowed since B not forbidden and position not 2 for B? Wait, no: B is prohibited from position 2? Not exactly: from feedback, B cannot be at position 2, but position 1 is allowed. And for A, position 2 is allowed.

So in ""BASIL"":
- B at position 1 → allowed? Yes, because position 1 is possible for B.
- A at position 2 → this is a possible position for A.

But we need to check if the word satisfies.

Another word: ""LAB A"" not, or ""BALSA"" → B,A,L,S,A → positions: B1,A2,L3,S4,A5? But double A, and A at position 2 and 5.

""BALSA"" is a word? Yes, meaning a type of wood.

But letters: B,A,L,S,A → A at pos2 and pos5.

In this case, for the first A at pos2, if it is correct or wrong position? But we know A is present.

Similarly, B at pos1.

The issue: we have L,S and possibly other.

But from constraints, A must be in 2,4,5: if we place A at pos2, that's fine. But we don't know yet.

We can choose such a word to test.

But maybe ""BASIC""? C is out, forbidden.

Not.

""BAILS"" B,A,I,L,S → similar to ""BASIL"" but ends with S.

""BAYLE"" E out? No E? ""BAYLS"" not a word, or ""BAILS"" is the plural form? Yes ""bails"", but might not be common; ""bails"" means something in cricket or law.

But let's stick with common words.

""ABYSM"" has S,M, but positions? A1,B2,Y,S,M—but A is at position 1? But position 1 is not allowed for A? From feedback: A is forbidden at position 1? Yes, from ""about"" feedback, A at position 1 was ""-"", meaning it is in word but not at pos1, so cannot be at pos1. So we cannot have A at position 1 anymore.

In ""ABYSM"", A is at position 1, which we know is wrong. We must avoid putting A at position 1 or 3.

Similarly, in our guess, we must avoid position 1 and 3 for A.

So back to words: if we want to test A at position 2, then position 2 must be A.

Then position 1 can be B? B is allowed at position 1.

So words with B at position 1 and A at position 2: e.g., ""BALMY"", but Y; ""BALED"" has E forbidden; ""BAGGY"" not 5 unique? But it can be.

"" BAULK"" or ""BAULK""? Not common; ""BAILS"" I mentioned earlier.

Perhaps ""BASIS"" B,A,S,I,S—has double S and I.

But I think ""BASIL"" is acceptable: B,A,S,I,L.

Letters: B,A,S,I,L.

All are not forbidden? S,I,L are allowed, yes.

Positions:
1: B
2: A
3: S
4: I
5: L

We know:
- Position 2: A—this could be correct or not; since we haven't tested position 2 for A before, if A is here, it might be correct; if not, we get ""-"" indicating wrong position.
- Position 1: B—similarly, B could be here or not; if here, it might be correct if position is right.

Also we test S,I,L.

Another possibility: place A at position 4 or 5.

For example, word with A at position 4: like "" P L A Y S "" but needs to include B.

""FLABS"" F,L,A,B,S → positions: F1,L2,A3,B4,S5—but A at position 3? Position 3 is forbidden for A? We know from first feedback A not at pos3. So cannot place A at pos3.

Similarly, only positions 2,4,5.

So if A at position 4:  ""**A**"" where first two letters are not A, last etc.

So with B: words like ""UMBRA"" but U is forbidden? No, U is out, forbidden.

Forbidden letters: C,E,R,N,O,U,T. So U not allowed.

Possible word with A at position 4 and B elsewhere: ""LABIA"" L,A,B,I,A—positions: L1,A2,B3,I4,A5—but here, A at position 2 and 5 and 5 again? And B at position 3. But position 2 for A is allowed.

In ""LABIA"", we have A at position 2, which is allowed, but we also place A at position 5? And B at position 3.

But we are testing multiple A positions at once? Might not be efficient.

Avoid putting A in a tested position unnecessarily.

Better to test one new position.

Since position 2 is available, and we haven't tested it, place A at position 2.

Similarly, for B, avoid position 2, which we know.

But position 1 for B is possible.

So ""BASIL"" seems reasonable.

Other words: ""CABAL"" but C forbidden.

Not.

""DA B B S"" D,A,B,B,S—double B? ""DA B S"" not.

""GA BB Y"" not.

I think ""BASIL"" is fine.

But let's consider if there's a word that has A at position 4 or 5 and B at another position, with new letters.

For example, A at position 4: ""SPLAT"" but P,L,A,T—T is forbidden? T was marked x in ""about"", so T out.

T is forbidden.

Similarly, O,U,T out.

So T forbidden.

Similarly, list forbidden: C,E,N,R,O,U,T.

So cannot use T.

Now S is available.

A at position 4: words like ""DELAY"" D,E—E out; not possible.

""D U A L"" U out.

""FLASK"" F,L,A,S,K—position: F1,L2,A3,S4,K5—but A at pos3? Forbidden. Cannot.

A at position 5: words like ""   I S B A"" so ending with A.

With B: ""CUR B A"" C,U not; ""BAR E A"" E; not.

""TUB A S"" T,U forbidden.

Difficult to find a word with B and A at position 5.

Perhaps place B at position 1 and A at position 4: ""B L A N K"" N forbidden; ""B E A M S"" E forbidden; ""B O A S T"" O,T forbidden.

""B K A S "" not word.

""BAS***"": with position 1 B, position 2 A, and then other letters.

So back to ""BASIL"".

Alternative: ""BASED"" has E forbidden.

""BASAL"" B,A,S,A,L—A at position 2 and 4? Positions: B1,A2,S3,A4,L5—so that tests A at position 2 and position 4? Might be acceptable.

""BASAL"" means relating to base.

Letters: B,A,S,A,L → so A at pos2 and pos4.

This could be useful: if A is at pos2, we might get ✓ or if at pos4, similarly.

But in one guess, we might get information on both positions.

Similarly, if neither, we still know A is present elsewhere.

But with one A, might be confusing, but we have the feedback per letter.

Since we know A is in word, and with two positions tested, we can see if any gets ✓ or both - etc.

For B, it's at position 1.

In ""BASAL"":
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: A (second instance)

If feedback gives:
- B at pos1 could be ✓ or - 
- A at pos2 could be correct if ✓ or - if elsewhere
- S at pos3: new, could be anything
- A at pos4: similarly might be ✓ or - or x? But A is in word, if the second A is not present, it would show ""-"" if position wrong or possibly ""x"" if duplicate? But feedback marks each occurrence separately.

Since the word has two A's, but if the secret word has only one A, one of the guesses might be marked wrong? Let's think.

For example, if secret word has A only once, say at position 4:

For ""BASAL"" guess:
- Pos1 B: if not in word, marked x; if in, ✓ or -
- Pos2 A: since A is not at pos2 (assuming in secret it's only at pos4), but A in word, so pos2 A should be ""-"" (wrong position)
- Pos3 S: unknown
- Pos4 A: correct position, so ""✓""
- Pos5 L: unknown

Similarly, other cases.

In ""BASAL"", we test A at positions 2 and 4, both possible.

I think ""BASIL"" might be better to avoid duplicate letters for simplicity, but ""BASAL"" is valid.

Another word: ""K A Y A K"" not 5? Or ""M A P S Y"" with A at pos2.

But let's choose.

Since we also want to test other consonants, S is crucial.

Also L in ""BASIL"".

Perhaps ""BASIS"" with S at end, but double S.

To maximize, I think ""BASIL"" is fine.

But B is already known, so testing new letters S,I,L might be good.

I will go with ""basil"".

But let's confirm it doesn't contain forbidden letters: B,A,S,I,L — none in C,E,R,N,O,U,T? Yes.

Positions: B1,A2,S3,I4,L5.

We haven't tested position 1 for B, position 2 for A, position 3 for S, etc., as requested.

This should give new information.

If A is at position 2, we might learn something straight.

Similarly for B at position 1.

Otherwise, we get feedback on positions.

So guess: ""basil"".

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. Since it's the first guess, I don't have any feedback to choose from.
 I want to choose a word that is likely to give me a lot of information. A good starting word should:
  - Have common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.
  - Have a good mix of vowels and consonants.
  - Avoid repeated letters to maximize information.

 Some popular starting words in Wordle are: 
   ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""SALET"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"". It has the vowels 'A' and 'E' and common consonants 'C', 'R', 'N'. It doesn't repeat any letters.

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>First, the previous guess was ""crane"" and the feedback was:

- C: x (not in the word)

- R: x (not in the word)

- A: - (in the word but wrong position)

- N: x (not in the word)

- E: x (not in the word)

From the feedback, I know that:

1. The letter A is in the secret word, but it's not in the second position (since in ""crane"", A is the third letter, position 2 if we start counting from 0, but positions are absolute). I should think in terms of the position in the word.

In ""crane"":

- Position 1: C

- Position 2: R

- Position 3: A

- Position 4: N

- Position 5: E

Feedback: C (pos1) x, R (pos2) x, A (pos3) -, N (pos4) x, E (pos5) x

So:

- A is in the secret word, but not at position 3.

- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in position 3, and the word does not contain C, R, N, or E.

I need to make a new guess of a 5-letter word that:

- Does not include C, R, N, E (since they are ruled out)

- Includes A, but not in position 3.

- I should choose a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters to test more possibilities.

Available letters: Since C, R, N, E are out, I need to avoid those.

Vowels: A is in, but E is out. Other vowels: I, O, U. Sometimes Y, but usually not a vowel in this context unless specified.

In Wordle, Y can be used as a vowel or consonant, but since E is out, and A is in, I should consider other vowels.

Consonants: Many options, but avoid C, R, N.

Common consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, B, etc.

My next guess should aim to find the position of A and discover other letters.

A is mispositioned, so it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since not position 3).

But position 1: if A were at position 1, but in the previous feedback, it wasn't correct, but since we had a -, it's not at pos3.

I should try to place A in a different position.

Also, since many letters are out, I can focus on words with A and other common letters.

Let me think of potential words that contain A but not C, R, N, E.

For example:

- Words with A in position 1: like ""APPLE"", but has E, which is out.

E is out, so no words with E.

- ""ALIGN"" but has N, out.

- ""AUDIO"" but has U, D, I, O – no forbidden letters except E,R,C,N are out, but U,D,I,O should be fine.

""AUDIO"" has no C,R,N,E? Let's check: A,U,D,I,O – all seem ok, but it has O, which might be good to test.

But A would be in position 1, which might be possible.

Since A is not at position 3, I could place it somewhere else.

Another idea: since A is the only letter I know is in, I should guess a word with A in position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5.

But I need to cover multiple possibilities.

Popular second guesses after feedback.

Since several letters are out, I can use a word that includes vowels I,O,U and consonants like T,S,L,D.

For instance, ""SAULT"" or something, but not a word.

Common words: ""PILOT"", but has no A. I need to include A.

Perhaps ""PLAIT"" – but let's see.

""TABLE"" – but has E, which is out.

E is out, so no E.

So no words containing E.

Also no C, R, N.

So possible letters: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but Q might be rare, etc.)

I should avoid rare letters.

A word like ""SALAD"" but has D and L, but it has A at position 1 and 4? Positions: S,A,L,A,D – so A at 2 and 4.

But I can guess it.

""SHALT"" not common.

""PLANT"" has N, out.

N is out.

Better: ""PASTA"" – P,A,S,T,A – but A at position 2 and 5.

Or ""PAINT"" has N, out.

""MAILS"" – M,A,I,L,S – A at position 2.

This has no forbidden letters.

Similarly, ""DAILY"" – D,A,I,L,Y – A at position 2.

But D,A,I,L,Y are all possible.

Perhaps choose a word to test common consonants.

Since A is the only known letter, I need to find where it is.

If I place A in a different position, say position 1, I can see if it's correct or not.

For example: guess a word with A in position 1.

Possible words: ""ABOUT"", ""AFTER"", but AFTER has E and R, both out? R is out, yes.

R is out.

""ABOUT"" – A,B,O,U,T – letters: A,B,O,U,T – none are forbidden? C,R,N,E are out, B,O,U,T are fine.

Similarly, ""ADMIT"" – A,D,M,I,T – also fine.

""AUDIO"" as I thought earlier.

""AUDIO"" is a word, A,U,D,I,O.

Positions: 1:A, 2:U, 3:D, 4:I, 5:O

But A is in position 1.

If I guess this, and A is not at position 1, I might get a - or something, but at least I'll know if it's at 1 or elsewhere.

Similarly, if it is at 1, I get ✓ for A at pos1.

A could be at other positions.

To maximize information, I might guess a word where A is not at position 3, and also include other vowels or consonants.

Another idea: since in ""crane"", position 3 was A but wrong position, I should avoid position 3 for A in the next guess.

In the feedback, A is in the word but not at pos3, so for my next guess, I can try A in position 1,2,4, or 5.

Let's list some candidate words:

- ""ABOUT"" : positions, A at 1

- ""ALONG"" : A at 1, L,O,N,G – but N is out, so no.

- ""APART"" : A at 1, P,A,R,T – R is out, no.

- ""ATOMS"" : A at 1, T,O,M,S – all ok? T,O,M,S are allowed.

- ""BLAST"" : B,L,A,S,T – A at position 3, but I'm not supposed to put it at position 3 because it might be wrong, but I can, but since it was wrong before, putting it at pos3 might not be useful, but it could be that it's still not there.

The position matters. When I put A at pos3, I got -, meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So if I put A at pos3 again, I might get x if it's not there, or - if it's moved, but I know it's not at pos3, so I should avoid pos3 for A.

Yes, so I should not put A at position 3 in the next guess.

Similarly, I can choose to put it in a new position.

Possible positions for A: 1,2,4,5.

Now, guess a word with A in one of these positions and new letters.

Also, I should test other vowels like I,O,U since E is out.

Consonants like S,T,L,D,M,P,B,G,K,H, etc.

Let me think of ""STAIR"" but has R, out.

No R.

""MAUVE"" has E, out.

No E.

""PILOT"" no A.

I need a word with A.

How about ""PLAID""? P,L,A,I,D – A at position 3? Position: P1, L2, A3, I4, D5. But if A at pos3, and it wasn't correct before, I should avoid pos3.

So ""PLAID"" has A at pos3, not good.

""FLAIL"" – F,L,A,I,L – A at pos3, again.

""QUAIL"" – Q might be rare, and A at pos3? Q,U,A,I,L – pos3 A.

Bad.

""ALIBI"" – A,L,I,B,I – A at position 1.

Letters: A,L,I,B – all allowed.

""ALIGN"" has N, out.

""ADAPT"" has P and T, but A at pos1.

""ADOPT"" same, O,P,T.

But no A required elsewhere.

"" DAISY"" – D,A,I,S,Y – A at position 2.

Good.

""BASIL"" – B,A,S,I,L – A at position 2.

Also good.

I could use ""SLATE"" but has E, out.

No E.

Another option: ""TOADY"" – T,O,A,D,Y – A at position 3? Positions: T1,O2,A3,D4,Y5 – but position 3 for A, which I should avoid.

Better to have A not at 3.

So words like ""PATIO"" – P,A,T,I,O – A at position 2.

Yes.

""RADIO"" has R, out.

R is out.

So ""PATIO"" : P,A,T,I,O – A at pos2.

Or ""TAKI"" not 5 letters.

""MANIA"" has N, out.

""OPT"" no.

I like ""ABOUT"": A at pos1, B,O,U,T – new letters.

""ADIOS"" – A,D,I,O,S – A at pos1.

Both fine.

Which one to choose.

Generally, S, T, L are very common consonants, so I might include them.

For example, ""PASTA"" – P,A,S,T,A – but positions: P1,A2,S3,T4,A5 – so A at pos2 and pos5.

I have two A's, which might be possible.

But in the secret word, it could have double letters, though not common.

Since feedback didn't indicate multiple, but from the previous feedback, A was mentioned once, which could mean one or more, but we don't know.

In the feedback, it's per letter instance, so in ""crane"" only one A, and it said -, so at least one A in word.

It could have more than one.

For my guess, ""PASTA"" has A at pos2 and pos5.

If I guess this, and for pos2 A, if it's correct I get ✓, else - , similarly for pos5.

Also, S and T at 3 and 4.

But S at pos3, T at pos4.

I need to decide.

With current knowledge, I should choose a word that covers more ground.

Perhaps ""ABOUT"" to test A at pos1 and introduce B,O,U,T.

Or ""DAISY"" for D,A,I,S,Y with A at pos2.

"" DAYIL"" not a word.

""HASTY"" H,A,S,T,Y – A at pos2.

"" FAST"" not 5.

I think ""SALAD"" is a word: S,A,L,A,D – A at pos2 and pos4.

Positions: 1S,2A,3L,4A,5D.

So A at 2 and 4.

When guessing, if A is at pos2, I might get ✓ or -, similarly for pos4.

But pos3 is L, not A.

I think ""SALAD"" is ok, but let's see if there's better.

Another common approach is to use words with high-frequency remaining letters.

Letters not yet tested: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,S,T,U,V,W,Y,Z (avoiding C,E,N,R and A is known in but position unknown)

Frequency in English: E is out, T is very common, A is in, O is common, I common, etc.

Top consonants: T, S, L, D, M, etc., since R and N are out.

Vowels: O, I, U.

So a word like ""POINT"" but has N, out.

""MOIST"" M,O,I,S,T – no A.

Need A.

""TOPAZ"" T,O,P,A,Z – A at pos4.

Letters ok.

""KOALA"" K,O,A,L,A – A at pos3 and pos5? Pos1:K,2:O,3:A,4:L,5:A – A at 3 and 5.

But I should avoid putting A at pos3, so not good.

Perhaps ""ASHED"" but has E, out.

No E.

""AVA G"" not a word.

I think ""ABOUT"" is a solid choice: A at pos1, B,O,U,T new.

""ADIEU"" has E and D,I,U, E is out.

Not.

""OASIS"" O,A,S,I,S – A at pos2, but has double S, might not be efficient.

""BASIC"" has C, out.

C is out.

Let me go with ""ABOUT"" for this guess.

So guess: A B O U T

Positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T

If A is at position 1, it could be correct; if not, it might show - or x, but since we know A is in word, if not at pos1, I'd get -.

Similarly, I test O,U,T,B.

O and U are vowels, B and T consonants.

T is very common.

U is less common, but ok.

Another option: ""AUDIO"" A,U,D,I,O – A at1, U at2, D at3, I at4, O at5. This has three vowels I,O,U, which might not give much consonant information.

Whereas ""ABOUT"" has T, which is good.

"" SALTY"" but has L,T,Y, no A? S,A,L,T,Y – yes A at pos2.

"" SALTY"" : S1,A2,L3,T4,Y5

A at pos2.

Then S,L,T,Y.

S and T are common.

L is common.

I think ""SALTY"" or ""ABOUT"" both ok.

Since A is likely not the first letter in many words, but I don't know.

Perhaps ""PATIO"" P,A,T,I,O – A at pos2, P,T,I,O.

T and O common.

I think I'll go with ""ABOUT"" for simplicity.

But let me confirm the word.

""ABOUT"" is a 5-letter word, yes.

C, R, N, E are excluded, and A is in.

So, my guess is ""about"".<thought>
Previous feedback for guess ""crane"" was: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
This means:
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (since it was marked with ""-"" at position 3 in ""crane"").

For the next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter English word without C, R, N, or E.
- Must include A, but not in position 3 (to avoid repeating a position we know is incorrect).
- Positions for A could be 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- I should prioritize common letters not yet tested to gather more information, such as B, O, U, T, S, L, D, etc.

Possible candidates:
- ""ABOUT"": Places A at position 1, tests B, O, U, T. Common letters, and avoids position 3 for A.
- ""SALTY"": Places A at position 2, tests S, L, T, Y. Avoids position 3 and uses common consonants.
- ""PATIO"": Places A at position 2, tests P, T, I, O. Good vowel/consonant mix.

""ABOUT"" is a strong choice because:
- It tests A at a new position (1).
- Includes high-frequency letters like T and O.
- Avoids vowels E (excluded) and focuses on U, which is less tested.

Thus, ""about"" is a valid guess that builds on the feedback efficiently.
</thought>

<guess>about</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(-) O(x) U(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on guess 3 now. Previous guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Interpretation:
- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was at position 3 in ""crane"").

Guess 2: ""about"" → Feedback: A(-), B(-), O(x), U(x), T(x)
Interpretation:
- A is again marked with ""-"", meaning A is in the word but not in position 1 (since in ""about"", A is at position 1).
- B is marked with ""-"", meaning B is in the word but not in position 2.
- O, U, T are not in the word at all (marked ""x"").

So from feedback so far:
- Definitely NOT in the word: C, E, R, N, O, U, T (since they are marked ""x"").
- Present in the word: A and B.
- Positions: 
  - A is not at position 1 (from ""about"") and not at position 3 (from ""crane""). Therefore, A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
  - B is not at position 2 (from ""about""). B could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Since we know A and B are both in the word, and we have eliminations on O, U, T, etc., we have a reduced set of possible letters.

Additional constraints:
- The word must not contain C, E, R, N, O, U, T.
- Contained letters: A and B (at least these).

We need to think of a word that:
- Includes A and B (both and at least one instance each).
- A not in position 1 or 3 → so positions 2, 4, or 5 for A.
- B not in position 2 → so positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 for B.

Also, we should avoid other forbidden letters.

Possible letters to include: besides A and B, we can use D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, S, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc. However, we should focus on common letters.

Since we have limited guesses (this is the third guess), we want to maximize information about the remaining positions.

Strategy:
- We know A must be in 2,4,5 and B in 1,3,4,5. Note that if B is in position 1, that's the only way it can be there since position 2 is prohibited for B. Similarly, for A, position 2 is now possible.

Possible positions for A: let's denote the secret word as _ _ _ _ _

- Position 2: if we place A there, it could be correct.
- Position 4 or 5: similar.

But we need to include B as well.

Moreover, we want to test new common letters.

Consider guessing a word where:
- A is placed at position 2 (since we haven't tested position 2 yet) and B at a new position (say position 1 or 3 or 4, but position 1 is allowed for B).

But B cannot be at position 2? Yes, but position 2 is for A if we place it there.

Alternatively, place A at position 4 or 5 to test a different position.

To optimize, we should choose a word that has A in one of the allowed positions and B in another allowed position, and introduce new high-frequency consonants or vowels (like S, L, I, etc.).

Common letters not yet tested: S, L, D, M, P, I, etc.

For example, if we place A at position 2 and B at position 1, we get words like ""BA**A"" or something. But we need to fill with other letters.

Possible words:
- ""BAS**"" must include two more letters. For example, ""BASIL"" or ""BASIS"" or ""BASAL"". However, ""BASIL"": B,A,S,I,L → positions: B1, A2, S3, I4, L5. 
  - But we must avoid forbidden letters. L and I are allowed? Yes, as long as not in the forbidden list.

Forbidden letters so far: C,E,R,N,O,U,T. So I and L are ok.

Similarly, S is allowed.

But ""BASIL"": 
- Position 1: B (which is allowed since B not forbidden and position not 2 for B? Wait, no: B is prohibited from position 2? Not exactly: from feedback, B cannot be at position 2, but position 1 is allowed. And for A, position 2 is allowed.

So in ""BASIL"":
- B at position 1 → allowed? Yes, because position 1 is possible for B.
- A at position 2 → this is a possible position for A.

But we need to check if the word satisfies.

Another word: ""LAB A"" not, or ""BALSA"" → B,A,L,S,A → positions: B1,A2,L3,S4,A5? But double A, and A at position 2 and 5.

""BALSA"" is a word? Yes, meaning a type of wood.

But letters: B,A,L,S,A → A at pos2 and pos5.

In this case, for the first A at pos2, if it is correct or wrong position? But we know A is present.

Similarly, B at pos1.

The issue: we have L,S and possibly other.

But from constraints, A must be in 2,4,5: if we place A at pos2, that's fine. But we don't know yet.

We can choose such a word to test.

But maybe ""BASIC""? C is out, forbidden.

Not.

""BAILS"" B,A,I,L,S → similar to ""BASIL"" but ends with S.

""BAYLE"" E out? No E? ""BAYLS"" not a word, or ""BAILS"" is the plural form? Yes ""bails"", but might not be common; ""bails"" means something in cricket or law.

But let's stick with common words.

""ABYSM"" has S,M, but positions? A1,B2,Y,S,M—but A is at position 1? But position 1 is not allowed for A? From feedback: A is forbidden at position 1? Yes, from ""about"" feedback, A at position 1 was ""-"", meaning it is in word but not at pos1, so cannot be at pos1. So we cannot have A at position 1 anymore.

In ""ABYSM"", A is at position 1, which we know is wrong. We must avoid putting A at position 1 or 3.

Similarly, in our guess, we must avoid position 1 and 3 for A.

So back to words: if we want to test A at position 2, then position 2 must be A.

Then position 1 can be B? B is allowed at position 1.

So words with B at position 1 and A at position 2: e.g., ""BALMY"", but Y; ""BALED"" has E forbidden; ""BAGGY"" not 5 unique? But it can be.

"" BAULK"" or ""BAULK""? Not common; ""BAILS"" I mentioned earlier.

Perhaps ""BASIS"" B,A,S,I,S—has double S and I.

But I think ""BASIL"" is acceptable: B,A,S,I,L.

Letters: B,A,S,I,L.

All are not forbidden? S,I,L are allowed, yes.

Positions:
1: B
2: A
3: S
4: I
5: L

We know:
- Position 2: A—this could be correct or not; since we haven't tested position 2 for A before, if A is here, it might be correct; if not, we get ""-"" indicating wrong position.
- Position 1: B—similarly, B could be here or not; if here, it might be correct if position is right.

Also we test S,I,L.

Another possibility: place A at position 4 or 5.

For example, word with A at position 4: like "" P L A Y S "" but needs to include B.

""FLABS"" F,L,A,B,S → positions: F1,L2,A3,B4,S5—but A at position 3? Position 3 is forbidden for A? We know from first feedback A not at pos3. So cannot place A at pos3.

Similarly, only positions 2,4,5.

So if A at position 4:  ""**A**"" where first two letters are not A, last etc.

So with B: words like ""UMBRA"" but U is forbidden? No, U is out, forbidden.

Forbidden letters: C,E,R,N,O,U,T. So U not allowed.

Possible word with A at position 4 and B elsewhere: ""LABIA"" L,A,B,I,A—positions: L1,A2,B3,I4,A5—but here, A at position 2 and 5 and 5 again? And B at position 3. But position 2 for A is allowed.

In ""LABIA"", we have A at position 2, which is allowed, but we also place A at position 5? And B at position 3.

But we are testing multiple A positions at once? Might not be efficient.

Avoid putting A in a tested position unnecessarily.

Better to test one new position.

Since position 2 is available, and we haven't tested it, place A at position 2.

Similarly, for B, avoid position 2, which we know.

But position 1 for B is possible.

So ""BASIL"" seems reasonable.

Other words: ""CABAL"" but C forbidden.

Not.

""DA B B S"" D,A,B,B,S—double B? ""DA B S"" not.

""GA BB Y"" not.

I think ""BASIL"" is fine.

But let's consider if there's a word that has A at position 4 or 5 and B at another position, with new letters.

For example, A at position 4: ""SPLAT"" but P,L,A,T—T is forbidden? T was marked x in ""about"", so T out.

T is forbidden.

Similarly, O,U,T out.

So T forbidden.

Similarly, list forbidden: C,E,N,R,O,U,T.

So cannot use T.

Now S is available.

A at position 4: words like ""DELAY"" D,E—E out; not possible.

""D U A L"" U out.

""FLASK"" F,L,A,S,K—position: F1,L2,A3,S4,K5—but A at pos3? Forbidden. Cannot.

A at position 5: words like ""   I S B A"" so ending with A.

With B: ""CUR B A"" C,U not; ""BAR E A"" E; not.

""TUB A S"" T,U forbidden.

Difficult to find a word with B and A at position 5.

Perhaps place B at position 1 and A at position 4: ""B L A N K"" N forbidden; ""B E A M S"" E forbidden; ""B O A S T"" O,T forbidden.

""B K A S "" not word.

""BAS***"": with position 1 B, position 2 A, and then other letters.

So back to ""BASIL"".

Alternative: ""BASED"" has E forbidden.

""BASAL"" B,A,S,A,L—A at position 2 and 4? Positions: B1,A2,S3,A4,L5—so that tests A at position 2 and position 4? Might be acceptable.

""BASAL"" means relating to base.

Letters: B,A,S,A,L → so A at pos2 and pos4.

This could be useful: if A is at pos2, we might get ✓ or if at pos4, similarly.

But in one guess, we might get information on both positions.

Similarly, if neither, we still know A is present elsewhere.

But with one A, might be confusing, but we have the feedback per letter.

Since we know A is in word, and with two positions tested, we can see if any gets ✓ or both - etc.

For B, it's at position 1.

In ""BASAL"":
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: A (second instance)

If feedback gives:
- B at pos1 could be ✓ or - 
- A at pos2 could be correct if ✓ or - if elsewhere
- S at pos3: new, could be anything
- A at pos4: similarly might be ✓ or - or x? But A is in word, if the second A is not present, it would show ""-"" if position wrong or possibly ""x"" if duplicate? But feedback marks each occurrence separately.

Since the word has two A's, but if the secret word has only one A, one of the guesses might be marked wrong? Let's think.

For example, if secret word has A only once, say at position 4:

For ""BASAL"" guess:
- Pos1 B: if not in word, marked x; if in, ✓ or -
- Pos2 A: since A is not at pos2 (assuming in secret it's only at pos4), but A in word, so pos2 A should be ""-"" (wrong position)
- Pos3 S: unknown
- Pos4 A: correct position, so ""✓""
- Pos5 L: unknown

Similarly, other cases.

In ""BASAL"", we test A at positions 2 and 4, both possible.

I think ""BASIL"" might be better to avoid duplicate letters for simplicity, but ""BASAL"" is valid.

Another word: ""K A Y A K"" not 5? Or ""M A P S Y"" with A at pos2.

But let's choose.

Since we also want to test other consonants, S is crucial.

Also L in ""BASIL"".

Perhaps ""BASIS"" with S at end, but double S.

To maximize, I think ""BASIL"" is fine.

But B is already known, so testing new letters S,I,L might be good.

I will go with ""basil"".

But let's confirm it doesn't contain forbidden letters: B,A,S,I,L — none in C,E,R,N,O,U,T? Yes.

Positions: B1,A2,S3,I4,L5.

We haven't tested position 1 for B, position 2 for A, position 3 for S, etc., as requested.

This should give new information.

If A is at position 2, we might learn something straight.

Similarly for B at position 1.

Otherwise, we get feedback on positions.

So guess: ""basil"".

<thought>
Summary of feedback and deductions:
- Eliminated letters: C, E, R, N, O, U, T
- Confirmed letters: A and B
- Position constraints:
  - A is not at position 1 or 3 → must be at 2, 4, or 5
  - B is not at position 2 → must be at 1, 3, 4, or 5

For guess 3, we need a word containing A and B, avoiding forbidden letters.
- ""basil"" (B,A,S,I,L) satisfies:
  - Position 1: B → possible position for B (could be correct or wrong position)
  - Position 2: A → possible position for A (could be correct or wrong position)
  - Introduces new common letters S, I, L to test their presence and positions.
- Avoids positions that are forbidden (A not at 1 or 3, B not at 2).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of A and B and provide information on S, I, L.
</thought>

<guess>basil</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- Guess 1 (""crane""): A is in the word but not at position 3. C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- Guess 2 (""about""): A is in the word but not at position 1. B is in the word but not at position 2. O, U, T are not in the word.

Deductions:
- **A** must be at position 2, 4, or 5 (cannot be at 1 or 3).
- **B** must be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (cannot be at 2).
- **Excluded letters**: C, E, R, N, O, U, T (cannot appear).
- **Included letters**: A and B are confirmed present.
- Other letters must be from the remaining pool: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the next guess:
- The word must contain A and B.
- A should be placed at a new untested position (2, 4, or 5) to gather positional information.
- B should avoid position 2 and be placed elsewhere.
- New letters should be tested to maximize information; common letters like S, I, L are prioritized.

""basil"" (B, A, S, I, L) is chosen because:
- Positions: B (position 1), A (position 2), S (position 3), I (position 4), L (position 5).
- Tests A at position 2 (unverified position) and B at position 1 (unverified position).
- Introduces high-frequency letters S, I, L.
- Avoids all excluded letters and adheres to positional constraints.

I should think in terms of the position in the word.\n\nIn ""crane"":\n\n- Position 1: C\n\n- Position 2: R\n\n- Position 3: A\n\n- Position 4: N\n\n- Position 5: E\n\nFeedback: C (pos1) x, R (pos2) x, A (pos3) -, N (pos4) x, E (pos5) x\n\nSo:\n\n- A is in the secret word, but not at position 3.\n\n- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.\n\nTherefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in position 3, and the word does not contain C, R, N, or E.\n\nI need to make a new guess of a 5-letter word that:\n\n- Does not include C, R, N, E (since they are ruled out)\n\n- Includes A, but not in position 3.\n\n- I should choose a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters to test more possibilities.\n\nAvailable letters: Since C, R, N, E are out, I need to avoid those.\n\nVowels: A is in, but E is out. Other vowels: I, O, U. Sometimes Y, but usually not a vowel in this context unless specified.\n\nIn Wordle, Y can be used as a vowel or consonant, but since E is out, and A is in, I should consider other vowels.\n\nConsonants: Many options, but avoid C, R, N.\n\nCommon consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, B, etc.\n\nMy next guess should aim to find the position of A and discover other letters.\n\nA is mispositioned, so it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since not position 3).\n\nBut position 1: if A were at position 1, but in the previous feedback, it wasn\'t correct, but since we had a -, it\'s not at pos3.\n\nI should try to place A in a different position.\n\nAlso, since many letters are out, I can focus on words with A and other common letters.\n\nLet me think of potential words that contain A but not C, R, N, E.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Words with A in position 1: like ""APPLE"", but has E, which is out.\n\nE is out, so no words with E.\n\n- ""ALIGN"" but has N, out.\n\n- ""AUDIO"" but has U, D, I, O – no forbidden letters except E,R,C,N are out, but U,D,I,O should be fine.\n\n""AUDIO"" has no C,R,N,E? Let\'s check: A,U,D,I,O – all seem ok, but it has O, which might be good to test.\n\nBut A would be in position 1, which might be possible.\n\nSince A is not at position 3, I could place it somewhere else.\n\nAnother idea: since A is the only letter I know is in, I should guess a word with A in position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5.\n\nBut I need to cover multiple possibilities.\n\nPopular second guesses after feedback.\n\nSince several letters are out, I can use a word that includes vowels I,O,U and consonants like T,S,L,D.\n\nFor instance, ""SAULT"" or something, but not a word.\n\nCommon words: ""PILOT"", but has no A. I need to include A.\n\nPerhaps ""PLAIT"" – but let\'s see.\n\n""TABLE"" – but has E, which is out.\n\nE is out, so no E.\n\nSo no words containing E.\n\nAlso no C, R, N.\n\nSo possible letters: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but Q might be rare, etc.)\n\nI should avoid rare letters.\n\nA word like ""SALAD"" but has D and L, but it has A at position 1 and 4? Positions: S,A,L,A,D – so A at 2 and 4.\n\nBut I can guess it.\n\n""SHALT"" not common.\n\n""PLANT"" has N, out.\n\nN is out.\n\nBetter: ""PASTA"" – P,A,S,T,A – but A at position 2 and 5.\n\nOr ""PAINT"" has N, out.\n\n""MAILS"" – M,A,I,L,S – A at position 2.\n\nThis has no forbidden letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""DAILY"" – D,A,I,L,Y – A at position 2.\n\nBut D,A,I,L,Y are all possible.\n\nPerhaps choose a word to test common consonants.\n\nSince A is the only known letter, I need to find where it is.\n\nIf I place A in a different position, say position 1, I can see if it\'s correct or not.\n\nFor example: guess a word with A in position 1.\n\nPossible words: ""ABOUT"", ""AFTER"", but AFTER has E and R, both out? R is out, yes.\n\nR is out.\n\n""ABOUT"" – A,B,O,U,T – letters: A,B,O,U,T – none are forbidden? C,R,N,E are out, B,O,U,T are fine.\n\nSimilarly, ""ADMIT"" – A,D,M,I,T – also fine.\n\n""AUDIO"" as I thought earlier.\n\n""AUDIO"" is a word, A,U,D,I,O.\n\nPositions: 1:A, 2:U, 3:D, 4:I, 5:O\n\nBut A is in position 1.\n\nIf I guess this, and A is not at position 1, I might get a - or something, but at least I\'ll know if it\'s at 1 or elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly, if it is at 1, I get ✓ for A at pos1.\n\nA could be at other positions.\n\nTo maximize information, I might guess a word where A is not at position 3, and also include other vowels or consonants.\n\nAnother idea: since in ""crane"", position 3 was A but wrong position, I should avoid position 3 for A in the next guess.\n\nIn the feedback, A is in the word but not at pos3, so for my next guess, I can try A in position 1,2,4, or 5.\n\nLet\'s list some candidate words:\n\n- ""ABOUT"" : positions, A at 1\n\n- ""ALONG"" : A at 1, L,O,N,G – but N is out, so no.\n\n- ""APART"" : A at 1, P,A,R,T – R is out, no.\n\n- ""ATOMS"" : A at 1, T,O,M,S – all ok? T,O,M,S are allowed.\n\n- ""BLAST"" : B,L,A,S,T – A at position 3, but I\'m not supposed to put it at position 3 because it might be wrong, but I can, but since it was wrong before, putting it at pos3 might not be useful, but it could be that it\'s still not there.\n\nThe position matters. When I put A at pos3, I got -, meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So if I put A at pos3 again, I might get x if it\'s not there, or - if it\'s moved, but I know it\'s not at pos3, so I should avoid pos3 for A.\n\nYes, so I should not put A at position 3 in the next guess.\n\nSimilarly, I can choose to put it in a new position.\n\nPossible positions for A: 1,2,4,5.\n\nNow, guess a word with A in one of these positions and new letters.\n\nAlso, I should test other vowels like I,O,U since E is out.\n\nConsonants like S,T,L,D,M,P,B,G,K,H, etc.\n\nLet me think of ""STAIR"" but has R, out.\n\nNo R.\n\n""MAUVE"" has E, out.\n\nNo E.\n\n""PILOT"" no A.\n\nI need a word with A.\n\nHow about ""PLAID""? P,L,A,I,D – A at position 3? Position: P1, L2, A3, I4, D5. But if A at pos3, and it wasn\'t correct before, I should avoid pos3.\n\nSo ""PLAID"" has A at pos3, not good.\n\n""FLAIL"" – F,L,A,I,L – A at pos3, again.\n\n""QUAIL"" – Q might be rare, and A at pos3? Q,U,A,I,L – pos3 A.\n\nBad.\n\n""ALIBI"" – A,L,I,B,I – A at position 1.\n\nLetters: A,L,I,B – all allowed.\n\n""ALIGN"" has N, out.\n\n""ADAPT"" has P and T, but A at pos1.\n\n""ADOPT"" same, O,P,T.\n\nBut no A required elsewhere.\n\n"" DAISY"" – D,A,I,S,Y – A at position 2.\n\nGood.\n\n""BASIL"" – B,A,S,I,L – A at position 2.\n\nAlso good.\n\nI could use ""SLATE"" but has E, out.\n\nNo E.\n\nAnother option: ""TOADY"" – T,O,A,D,Y – A at position 3? Positions: T1,O2,A3,D4,Y5 – but position 3 for A, which I should avoid.\n\nBetter to have A not at 3.\n\nSo words like ""PATIO"" – P,A,T,I,O – A at position 2.\n\nYes.\n\n""RADIO"" has R, out.\n\nR is out.\n\nSo ""PATIO"" : P,A,T,I,O – A at pos2.\n\nOr ""TAKI"" not 5 letters.\n\n""MANIA"" has N, out.\n\n""OPT"" no.\n\nI like ""ABOUT"": A at pos1, B,O,U,T – new letters.\n\n""ADIOS"" – A,D,I,O,S – A at pos1.\n\nBoth fine.\n\nWhich one to choose.\n\nGenerally, S, T, L are very common consonants, so I might include them.\n\nFor example, ""PASTA"" – P,A,S,T,A – but positions: P1,A2,S3,T4,A5 – so A at pos2 and pos5.\n\nI have two A\'s, which might be possible.\n\nBut in the secret word, it could have double letters, though not common.\n\nSince feedback didn\'t indicate multiple, but from the previous feedback, A was mentioned once, which could mean one or more, but we don\'t know.\n\nIn the feedback, it\'s per letter instance, so in ""crane"" only one A, and it said -, so at least one A in word.\n\nIt could have more than one.\n\nFor my guess, ""PASTA"" has A at pos2 and pos5.\n\nIf I guess this, and for pos2 A, if it\'s correct I get ✓, else - , similarly for pos5.\n\nAlso, S and T at 3 and 4.\n\nBut S at pos3, T at pos4.\n\nI need to decide.\n\nWith current knowledge, I should choose a word that covers more ground.\n\nPerhaps ""ABOUT"" to test A at pos1 and introduce B,O,U,T.\n\nOr ""DAISY"" for D,A,I,S,Y with A at pos2.\n\n"" DAYIL"" not a word.\n\n""HASTY"" H,A,S,T,Y – A at pos2.\n\n"" FAST"" not 5.\n\nI think ""SALAD"" is a word: S,A,L,A,D – A at pos2 and pos4.\n\nPositions: 1S,2A,3L,4A,5D.\n\nSo A at 2 and 4.\n\nWhen guessing, if A is at pos2, I might get ✓ or -, similarly for pos4.\n\nBut pos3 is L, not A.\n\nI think ""SALAD"" is ok, but let\'s see if there\'s better.\n\nAnother common approach is to use words with high-frequency remaining letters.\n\nLetters not yet tested: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,S,T,U,V,W,Y,Z (avoiding C,E,N,R and A is known in but position unknown)\n\nFrequency in English: E is out, T is very common, A is in, O is common, I common, etc.\n\nTop consonants: T, S, L, D, M, etc., since R and N are out.\n\nVowels: O, I, U.\n\nSo a word like ""POINT"" but has N, out.\n\n""MOIST"" M,O,I,S,T – no A.\n\nNeed A.\n\n""TOPAZ"" T,O,P,A,Z – A at pos4.\n\nLetters ok.\n\n""KOALA"" K,O,A,L,A – A at pos3 and pos5? Pos1:K,2:O,3:A,4:L,5:A – A at 3 and 5.\n\nBut I should avoid putting A at pos3, so not good.\n\nPerhaps ""ASHED"" but has E, out.\n\nNo E.\n\n""AVA G"" not a word.\n\nI think ""ABOUT"" is a solid choice: A at pos1, B,O,U,T new.\n\n""ADIEU"" has E and D,I,U, E is out.\n\nNot.\n\n""OASIS"" O,A,S,I,S – A at pos2, but has double S, might not be efficient.\n\n""BASIC"" has C, out.\n\nC is out.\n\nLet me go with ""ABOUT"" for this guess.\n\nSo guess: A B O U T\n\nPositions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T\n\nIf A is at position 1, it could be correct; if not, it might show - or x, but since we know A is in word, if not at pos1, I\'d get -.\n\nSimilarly, I test O,U,T,B.\n\nO and U are vowels, B and T consonants.\n\nT is very common.\n\nU is less common, but ok.\n\nAnother option: ""AUDIO"" A,U,D,I,O – A at1, U at2, D at3, I at4, O at5. This has three vowels I,O,U, which might not give much consonant information.\n\nWhereas ""ABOUT"" has T, which is good.\n\n"" SALTY"" but has L,T,Y, no A? S,A,L,T,Y – yes A at pos2.\n\n"" SALTY"" : S1,A2,L3,T4,Y5\n\nA at pos2.\n\nThen S,L,T,Y.\n\nS and T are common.\n\nL is common.\n\nI think ""SALTY"" or ""ABOUT"" both ok.\n\nSince A is likely not the first letter in many words, but I don\'t know.\n\nPerhaps ""PATIO"" P,A,T,I,O – A at pos2, P,T,I,O.\n\nT and O common.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""ABOUT"" for simplicity.\n\nBut let me confirm the word.\n\n""ABOUT"" is a 5-letter word, yes.\n\nC, R, N, E are excluded, and A is in.\n\nSo, my guess is ""about"".<thought>\nPrevious feedback for guess ""crane"" was: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)\nThis means:\n- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.\n- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (since it was marked with ""-"" at position 3 in ""crane"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must be a 5-letter English word without C, R, N, or E.\n- Must include A, but not in position 3 (to avoid repeating a position we know is incorrect).\n- Positions for A could be 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n- I should prioritize common letters not yet tested to gather more information, such as B, O, U, T, S, L, D, etc.\n\nPossible candidates:\n- ""ABOUT"": Places A at position 1, tests B, O, U, T. Common letters, and avoids position 3 for A.\n- ""SALTY"": Places A at position 2, tests S, L, T, Y. Avoids position 3 and uses common consonants.\n- ""PATIO"": Places A at position 2, tests P, T, I, O. Good vowel/consonant mix.\n\n""ABOUT"" is a strong choice because:\n- It tests A at a new position (1).\n- Includes high-frequency letters like T and O.\n- Avoids vowels E (excluded) and focuses on U, which is less tested.\n\nThus, ""about"" is a valid guess that builds on the feedback efficiently.\n</thought>\n\n<guess>about</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(-) O(x) U(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are on guess 3 now. Previous guesses and feedback:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)\nInterpretation:\n- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was at position 3 in ""crane"").\n\nGuess 2: ""about"" → Feedback: A(-), B(-), O(x), U(x), T(x)\nInterpretation:\n- A is again marked with ""-"", meaning A is in the word but not in position 1 (since in ""about"", A is at position 1).\n- B is marked with ""-"", meaning B is in the word but not in position 2.\n- O, U, T are not in the word at all (marked ""x"").\n\nSo from feedback so far:\n- Definitely NOT in the word: C, E, R, N, O, U, T (since they are marked ""x"").\n- Present in the word: A and B.\n- Positions: \n  - A is not at position 1 (from ""about"") and not at position 3 (from ""crane""). Therefore, A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.\n  - B is not at position 2 (from ""about""). B could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nSince we know A and B are both in the word, and we have eliminations on O, U, T, etc., we have a reduced set of possible letters.\n\nAdditional constraints:\n- The word must not contain C, E, R, N, O, U, T.\n- Contained letters: A and B (at least these).\n\nWe need to think of a word that:\n- Includes A and B (both and at least one instance each).\n- A not in position 1 or 3 → so positions 2, 4, or 5 for A.\n- B not in position 2 → so positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 for B.\n\nAlso, we should avoid other forbidden letters.\n\nPossible letters to include: besides A and B, we can use D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, S, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc. However, we should focus on common letters.\n\nSince we have limited guesses (this is the third guess), we want to maximize information about the remaining positions.\n\nStrategy:\n- We know A must be in 2,4,5 and B in 1,3,4,5. Note that if B is in position 1, that\'s the only way it can be there since position 2 is prohibited for B. Similarly, for A, position 2 is now possible.\n\nPossible positions for A: let\'s denote the secret word as _ _ _ _ _\n\n- Position 2: if we place A there, it could be correct.\n- Position 4 or 5: similar.\n\nBut we need to include B as well.\n\nMoreover, we want to test new common letters.\n\nConsider guessing a word where:\n- A is placed at position 2 (since we haven\'t tested position 2 yet) and B at a new position (say position 1 or 3 or 4, but position 1 is allowed for B).\n\nBut B cannot be at position 2? Yes, but position 2 is for A if we place it there.\n\nAlternatively, place A at position 4 or 5 to test a different position.\n\nTo optimize, we should choose a word that has A in one of the allowed positions and B in another allowed position, and introduce new high-frequency consonants or vowels (like S, L, I, etc.).\n\nCommon letters not yet tested: S, L, D, M, P, I, etc.\n\nFor example, if we place A at position 2 and B at position 1, we get words like ""BA**A"" or something. But we need to fill with other letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BAS**"" must include two more letters. For example, ""BASIL"" or ""BASIS"" or ""BASAL"". However, ""BASIL"": B,A,S,I,L → positions: B1, A2, S3, I4, L5. \n  - But we must avoid forbidden letters. L and I are allowed? Yes, as long as not in the forbidden list.\n\nForbidden letters so far: C,E,R,N,O,U,T. So I and L are ok.\n\nSimilarly, S is allowed.\n\nBut ""BASIL"": \n- Position 1: B (which is allowed since B not forbidden and position not 2 for B? Wait, no: B is prohibited from position 2? Not exactly: from feedback, B cannot be at position 2, but position 1 is allowed. And for A, position 2 is allowed.\n\nSo in ""BASIL"":\n- B at position 1 → allowed? Yes, because position 1 is possible for B.\n- A at position 2 → this is a possible position for A.\n\nBut we need to check if the word satisfies.\n\nAnother word: ""LAB A"" not, or ""BALSA"" → B,A,L,S,A → positions: B1,A2,L3,S4,A5? But double A, and A at position 2 and 5.\n\n""BALSA"" is a word? Yes, meaning a type of wood.\n\nBut letters: B,A,L,S,A → A at pos2 and pos5.\n\nIn this case, for the first A at pos2, if it is correct or wrong position? But we know A is present.\n\nSimilarly, B at pos1.\n\nThe issue: we have L,S and possibly other.\n\nBut from constraints, A must be in 2,4,5: if we place A at pos2, that\'s fine. But we don\'t know yet.\n\nWe can choose such a word to test.\n\nBut maybe ""BASIC""? C is out, forbidden.\n\nNot.\n\n""BAILS"" B,A,I,L,S → similar to ""BASIL"" but ends with S.\n\n""BAYLE"" E out? No E? ""BAYLS"" not a word, or ""BAILS"" is the plural form? Yes ""bails"", but might not be common; ""bails"" means something in cricket or law.\n\nBut let\'s stick with common words.\n\n""ABYSM"" has S,M, but positions? A1,B2,Y,S,M—but A is at position 1? But position 1 is not allowed for A? From feedback: A is forbidden at position 1? Yes, from ""about"" feedback, A at position 1 was ""-"", meaning it is in word but not at pos1, so cannot be at pos1. So we cannot have A at position 1 anymore.\n\nIn ""ABYSM"", A is at position 1, which we know is wrong. We must avoid putting A at position 1 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, in our guess, we must avoid position 1 and 3 for A.\n\nSo back to words: if we want to test A at position 2, then position 2 must be A.\n\nThen position 1 can be B? B is allowed at position 1.\n\nSo words with B at position 1 and A at position 2: e.g., ""BALMY"", but Y; ""BALED"" has E forbidden; ""BAGGY"" not 5 unique? But it can be.\n\n"" BAULK"" or ""BAULK""? Not common; ""BAILS"" I mentioned earlier.\n\nPerhaps ""BASIS"" B,A,S,I,S—has double S and I.\n\nBut I think ""BASIL"" is acceptable: B,A,S,I,L.\n\nLetters: B,A,S,I,L.\n\nAll are not forbidden? S,I,L are allowed, yes.\n\nPositions:\n1: B\n2: A\n3: S\n4: I\n5: L\n\nWe know:\n- Position 2: A—this could be correct or not; since we haven\'t tested position 2 for A before, if A is here, it might be correct; if not, we get ""-"" indicating wrong position.\n- Position 1: B—similarly, B could be here or not; if here, it might be correct if position is right.\n\nAlso we test S,I,L.\n\nAnother possibility: place A at position 4 or 5.\n\nFor example, word with A at position 4: like "" P L A Y S "" but needs to include B.\n\n""FLABS"" F,L,A,B,S → positions: F1,L2,A3,B4,S5—but A at position 3? Position 3 is forbidden for A? We know from first feedback A not at pos3. So cannot place A at pos3.\n\nSimilarly, only positions 2,4,5.\n\nSo if A at position 4:  ""**A**"" where first two letters are not A, last etc.\n\nSo with B: words like ""UMBRA"" but U is forbidden? No, U is out, forbidden.\n\nForbidden letters: C,E,R,N,O,U,T. So U not allowed.\n\nPossible word with A at position 4 and B elsewhere: ""LABIA"" L,A,B,I,A—positions: L1,A2,B3,I4,A5—but here, A at position 2 and 5 and 5 again? And B at position 3. But position 2 for A is allowed.\n\nIn ""LABIA"", we have A at position 2, which is allowed, but we also place A at position 5? And B at position 3.\n\nBut we are testing multiple A positions at once? Might not be efficient.\n\nAvoid putting A in a tested position unnecessarily.\n\nBetter to test one new position.\n\nSince position 2 is available, and we haven\'t tested it, place A at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, for B, avoid position 2, which we know.\n\nBut position 1 for B is possible.\n\nSo ""BASIL"" seems reasonable.\n\nOther words: ""CABAL"" but C forbidden.\n\nNot.\n\n""DA B B S"" D,A,B,B,S—double B? ""DA B S"" not.\n\n""GA BB Y"" not.\n\nI think ""BASIL"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s consider if there\'s a word that has A at position 4 or 5 and B at another position, with new letters.\n\nFor example, A at position 4: ""SPLAT"" but P,L,A,T—T is forbidden? T was marked x in ""about"", so T out.\n\nT is forbidden.\n\nSimilarly, O,U,T out.\n\nSo T forbidden.\n\nSimilarly, list forbidden: C,E,N,R,O,U,T.\n\nSo cannot use T.\n\nNow S is available.\n\nA at position 4: words like ""DELAY"" D,E—E out; not possible.\n\n""D U A L"" U out.\n\n""FLASK"" F,L,A,S,K—position: F1,L2,A3,S4,K5—but A at pos3? Forbidden. Cannot.\n\nA at position 5: words like ""   I S B A"" so ending with A.\n\nWith B: ""CUR B A"" C,U not; ""BAR E A"" E; not.\n\n""TUB A S"" T,U forbidden.\n\nDifficult to find a word with B and A at position 5.\n\nPerhaps place B at position 1 and A at position 4: ""B L A N K"" N forbidden; ""B E A M S"" E forbidden; ""B O A S T"" O,T forbidden.\n\n""B K A S "" not word.\n\n""BAS***"": with position 1 B, position 2 A, and then other letters.\n\nSo back to ""BASIL"".\n\nAlternative: ""BASED"" has E forbidden.\n\n""BASAL"" B,A,S,A,L—A at position 2 and 4? Positions: B1,A2,S3,A4,L5—so that tests A at position 2 and position 4? Might be acceptable.\n\n""BASAL"" means relating to base.\n\nLetters: B,A,S,A,L → so A at pos2 and pos4.\n\nThis could be useful: if A is at pos2, we might get ✓ or if at pos4, similarly.\n\nBut in one guess, we might get information on both positions.\n\nSimilarly, if neither, we still know A is present elsewhere.\n\nBut with one A, might be confusing, but we have the feedback per letter.\n\nSince we know A is in word, and with two positions tested, we can see if any gets ✓ or both - etc.\n\nFor B, it\'s at position 1.\n\nIn ""BASAL"":\n- Position 1: B\n- Position 2: A\n- Position 3: S\n- Position 4: A (second instance)\n\nIf feedback gives:\n- B at pos1 could be ✓ or - \n- A at pos2 could be correct if ✓ or - if elsewhere\n- S at pos3: new, could be anything\n- A at pos4: similarly might be ✓ or - or x? But A is in word, if the second A is not present, it would show ""-"" if position wrong or possibly ""x"" if duplicate? But feedback marks each occurrence separately.\n\nSince the word has two A\'s, but if the secret word has only one A, one of the guesses might be marked wrong? Let\'s think.\n\nFor example, if secret word has A only once, say at position 4:\n\nFor ""BASAL"" guess:\n- Pos1 B: if not in word, marked x; if in, ✓ or -\n- Pos2 A: since A is not at pos2 (assuming in secret it\'s only at pos4), but A in word, so pos2 A should be ""-"" (wrong position)\n- Pos3 S: unknown\n- Pos4 A: correct position, so ""✓""\n- Pos5 L: unknown\n\nSimilarly, other cases.\n\nIn ""BASAL"", we test A at positions 2 and 4, both possible.\n\nI think ""BASIL"" might be better to avoid duplicate letters for simplicity, but ""BASAL"" is valid.\n\nAnother word: ""K A Y A K"" not 5? Or ""M A P S Y"" with A at pos2.\n\nBut let\'s choose.\n\nSince we also want to test other consonants, S is crucial.\n\nAlso L in ""BASIL"".\n\nPerhaps ""BASIS"" with S at end, but double S.\n\nTo maximize, I think ""BASIL"" is fine.\n\nBut B is already known, so testing new letters S,I,L might be good.\n\nI will go with ""basil"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm it doesn\'t contain forbidden letters: B,A,S,I,L — none in C,E,R,N,O,U,T? Yes.\n\nPositions: B1,A2,S3,I4,L5.\n\nWe haven\'t tested position 1 for B, position 2 for A, position 3 for S, etc., as requested.\n\nThis should give new information.\n\nIf A is at position 2, we might learn something straight.\n\nSimilarly for B at position 1.\n\nOtherwise, we get feedback on positions.\n\nSo guess: ""basil"".\n\n<thought>\nSummary of feedback and deductions:\n- Eliminated letters: C, E, R, N, O, U, T\n- Confirmed letters: A and B\n- Position constraints:\n  - A is not at position 1 or 3 → must be at 2, 4, or 5\n  - B is not at position 2 → must be at 1, 3, 4, or 5\n\nFor guess 3, we need a word containing A and B, avoiding forbidden letters.\n- ""basil"" (B,A,S,I,L) satisfies:\n  - Position 1: B → possible position for B (could be correct or wrong position)\n  - Position 2: A → possible position for A (could be correct or wrong position)\n  - Introduces new common letters S, I, L to test their presence and positions.\n- Avoids positions that are forbidden (A not at 1 or 3, B not at 2).\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of A and B and provide information on S, I, L.\n</thought>\n\n<guess>basil</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n- Guess 1 (""crane""): A is in the word but not at position 3.

We are on guess 4 now. Previous guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word, not at position 3.
- C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""about"" → A(-), B(-), O(x), U(x), T(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word, not at position 1.
- B is in the word, not at position 2.
- O, U, T are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""basil"" → B(✓), A(✓), S(✓), I(✓), L(x)
Meaning:
- B at position 1 is correct (✓).
- A at position 2 is correct (✓).
- S at position 3 is correct (✓).
- I at position 4 is correct (✓).
- L is not in the word (x), so L(x).

So from this feedback:
- Positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all correct: B, A, S, I respectively.
- Position 5 is not L, so we need to find the letter for position 5.
- Since positions 1-4 are correct, the secret word is "" B A S I _ "".
- The letter at position 5 must not be L (from L(x)), and must not be any of the previously excluded letters: C,E,R,N,O,U,T (from previous feedback).
- Additionally, since L is x, L is not in the word at all.

We know from guess 3 that:
- Position 1: B (correct)
- Position 2: A (correct)
- Position 3: S (correct)
- Position 4: I (correct)
- Position 5: unknown, but incorrect for L.

Therefore, the secret word is ""BAS I _"", and we need to guess the last letter.

Possible letters for position 5: must be from the English alphabet, excluding forbidden letters.

Forbidden letters:
- Known not in word: C,E,R,N,O,U,T,L (from feedback).
- Other letters excluded? We don't have complete list yet.

We also know that A is at position 2, and in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and gave -, but now we know position is correct.

Now, for position 5: we need a letter that:
- Is not excluded: so avoid C,E,N,R,O,U,T,L.
- Must form a valid English word with ""BASI"".

Possible words ending with ""BAS I"" : BAS I + ? Let's think of words that start with ""B A S I"".

Short words: ""BASIC"" - but C is excluded? C is forbidden since guess 1 C(x), so not. Also ends with C.

""BASIL"" we guessed and L is excluded? L(x) from guess 3.

""BASIS"" ends with S? B,A,S,I,S → positions 1:B,2:A,3:S,4:I,5:S. But S at position 5? In guess 3, we have S at position 3 which is ✓, but the word ""BASIS"" has S at position 5 as well? That might be possible.

Check feedback: in guess 3 (""basil""), S at position 3 is marked ✓, but it doesn't say anything about having multiple S's? The secret word might have another S? Not necessarily.

But in feedback for ""basil"": S is at position 3 and marked correct; position 5 was L, marked x. But if we guess a word with S at position 5, since S is already in word (position 3), but position 5 might be correct or not for that S instance.

But let's see possibilities.

First, "" BASIS"" : it would be B,A,S,I,S → so letter at pos5 is S.

Is S allowed? We don't know if S can be duplicated? The secret word might have only one S? Unclear.

Another word: ""BASIN"" N at end? N forbidden from guess 1.

""N"" is excluded.

""BASIL"" L excluded.

""BASIC"" C excluded.

Other possibilities: what about ""BASIS""? Or ""BASIS"" exists.

But S: from guess 3, we know that S is at position 3, but position 5 is different.

If we guess ""BASIS"", it would test if position 5 is S.

Since no feedback indicated multiple S, it could be.

But let's list all possible words starting with ""BASI"" and last letter not forbidden.

Forbidden: C,E,R,N,O,U,T,L.

So possible letters: D,F,G,H,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now, which of these can form words?

- D: ""BASID"" not a word.
- F: ""BASIF"" no.
- G: ""BASIG"" no.
- H: ""BASIH"" no. ""BASH"" is 4 letters.
- K: ""BASIK"" no. ""BASIC"" C excluded.
- M: ""BASIM"" no. Perhaps ""BASIM"" not a word.
- P: ""BASIP"" not. ""BASIP"" ?
- Q: no.
- V: ""BASIV"" not.
- W: ""BAS I W"" not.
- X: ""BASIX"" not common; ""BASIX"" might be brand, not typical word.
- Y: ""BASI Y""? ""BASIFY"" >5 letters. ""BASIS"" has S, but S not ending.
- Z: ""BASIZ"" not.

Perhaps I missed something.

What five-letter words start with ""BASI""?

Common ones: ""BASIC"", ""BASIL"", ""BASIS"", ""BASIN"".

But ""BASIC"" C excluded, ""BASIL"" L excluded, ""BASIN"" N excluded.

""BASIS"" is the remaining: B,A,S,I,S → ends with S.

But S: in guess 3, S at position 3 is correct, but that doesn't prevent S from being at other positions? Only if ""x"" indicated not present, but here S was confirmed at pos3.

In the secret word, if it has only one S, at position 3, then position 5 S would be incorrect? But since S is already present, position 5 might be marked as ""-"" if S is elsewhere, or ""x"" if not duplicated? But feedback might mark it accordingly.

However, ""BASIS"" is a valid word.

Another possibility: ""BASED"" E,D? E excluded, so no.

""BACCY"" not.

Perhaps non-standard, but we must use English words.

What about ""BASIJ"" not English.

Is there ""B A S I K""? No, ""BASIC"" only.

Perhaps I have it wrong: the word is ""BAS I"" followed by a letter, so four letters fixed: B,A,S,I.

Position 5 must complete the word.

Possible: - S: ""BASIS"" (but double S)

Or - H: ""BASHI"" might be a word? ""Bashi"" is a term in some contexts, like in Japanese or Turkish? But Wordle typically uses common English words. ""Bashi"" might not be accepted.

- M: ""BASIS"" with M? ""BASIM"" not a word.

List all English words ending in I, but with prefix BAS? Difficult.

Perhaps I misunderstand: the secret word has positions 1-4 fixed: B at 1, A at 2, S at 3, I at 4, so ""BAS I"" as in ""BAS"" + I at fourth position.

Then fifth position.

Words: ""BASIC"", ""BASIL"", ""BASIN"", ""BASIS"" — that's about it for common words.

- ""BASID"" not

- ""BASIJ"" not

"" BASIS"" seems the only possible, but it has S at position 5.

In ""BASIS"", position 5 is S.

Now, S is already in the word at position 3.

Is ""BASIS"" a valid guess? Yes, it is a word.

Feedback: if secret is ""BASIC"", but C excluded, can't be.

Similarly, ""BASIL"" L excluded.

""BASIN"" N excluded.

So only ""BASIS"" left? But L is excluded, so ""BASIS"" must be it.

Unless I missed some word.

""BAKED"" but K,E—E excluded; no.

Possible that position 5 is Y or something else? ""BASIY"" not word.

""BASTI"" T excluded, since T(x) in guess 2.

T forbidden.

""BASIP"" not.

Perhaps ""BASIT"" T excluded.

Another word: ""FOCI"" not.

I think only ""BASIS"" is possible when we ignore forbidden letters, but we have forbidden letters, and ""BASIS"" uses S twice.

So we need to guess ""basis""?""

But let's confirm the feedback rules.

If we guess ""basis"":
- Position 1: B → should be ✓ (since correct in previous)
- Position 2: A → ✓
- Position 3: S → ✓
- Position 4: I → ✓
- Position 5: S

Now, if the secret word has S at only position 3, then position 5 S would be incorrect? But since S is already in the word, it might be marked as ""-"" if S can be duplicated? Or ""x"" if not present elsewhere.

But in Wordle, if the secret word has only one S, and you guess S in another position, it will be marked ""-"" if the letter is present elsewhere, or ""x"" if not; but if not present at that position, and not duplicated, it depends.

Standard rule: if the secret has a letter once, and you guess that letter twice, for the second occurrence, if it's not in the word in that position or anywhere, it might be marked ""x"".

But here, since S is in the secret, but only one S (at position 3), then position 5 S should be marked ""-"" only if that position is wrong and there is another S instance? Let's recall.

Feedback symbols:
- ✓: correct letter and correct position.
- -: letter is in the word but wrong position (and for duplicates, it might be marked as such).
- x: letter not in the word.

For duplicates: if secret has one S, and you guess two S's, the first S (at correct position) is ✓, the second S at wrong position might be marked ""x"" if not in word, or ""-"" if it could be considered? But since there is only one S in secret, but already used, the second S should be marked ""x"" because it doesn't exist? So, in guess, when you guess a letter multiple times, feedback accounts for each occurrence:

- If secret has one S: only the correct position S gets ✓ or possibly other if position wrong; but for each occurrence, it is evaluated separately.

For example, secret: STEAL, guess: STEEL → S✓, T✓, E✓ (position correct), E(position wrong? Second E: letter E is in word, but the second E is not used, so secret has only one E, guess has two E's: first E at pos3 is correct ✓, second E at pos4 is not correct, and since no other E in secret, it should be x? Or?

Actually, Wordle handles duplicates: for each letter in guess, it checks if it matches in secret position-wise, then unmatched letters are checked for presence.

Simple rule: position-based.

But for simplicity, in this feedback format, we need to infer.

In our case, for ""basis"" guess, if secret has one S at position 3:
- Pos1 B ✓
- Pos2 A ✓
- Pos3 S ✓
- Pos4 I ✓
- Pos5 S: since secret has no S at position 5, and only one S (at pos3), which is already matched, so S at pos5 should be x (not present) or -?

I think feedback would mark it as: since there is no second S in secret, S at position 5 is not present in the word, so marked ""x"". So ""BASIS"" with S at pos5 would give x for that position if secret has only one S.

But we don't know if secret has multiple S; it could have.

In guess 3 (""basil""), we have S at position 3 marked ✓, but secret could have another S? Possible.

For position 5, we need to guess a letter.

If only ""BASIS"" is possible common word, perhaps it is.

But not her  letters.

Maybe I missed a word.

Another possibility: ""BAST I"" T excluded.

"" BARK I"" no.

Perhaps ""BASIN"" N excluded.

List of words: possible 5-letter words starting with BASI.

On average: BASIS, BASIC, BASIL, BASIN.

All others seem non-standard.

With Y: ""BAS I Y"" not.

Therefore, likely ""BASIS"" is the word, and we should guess it.

And since L is excluded, and others, so position 5 is S.

But in secret, If position 5 is S, then it has two S's; in guess 3, we had L at position 5 which is x, so S could be at position 5.

Feedback for ""basil"" showed L(x), meaning L not in word, but S at position 3 is in correct position.

Secret is ""BASIS"".

We can guess ""basis"".

But et's assume that is the only possibility.

So for guess 4, ""basis"".

But we have only a few guesses left, but we know position 5 must be filled.

If we guess ""basis"" and it is the secret, we win.

If not, feedback will tell.

But based on deduction, it must be ""basis"" given the constraints.

Other letters: for example, K: but ""BASIK"" not word.

G: ""BASIG"" no.

So I think ""basis"" is the guess.

<thought>
Recap:
- Secret word positions 1-4: B, A, S, I are confirmed correct and in place, so far.
- Position 5: L is incorrect and not in the word, so secret must be ""BASI?"" 
- Excluded letters: C, E, R, N, O, U, T, L
- Possible words: Only ""BASIS"" fits as a common English word that matches the known prefix and avoids excluded letters.
  - ""BASIC"" (C excluded)
  - ""BASIL"" (L excluded)
  - ""BASIN"" (N excluded)
  - Thus, ""basis"" is the only reasonable candidate.

Guess ""basis"": Since positions 1-4 are already correct, they will remain ✓, and position 5 will be S—this should be ✓ if correct.
</thought>

<guess>basis</guess>Previous feedback confirms:
- Positions 1 to 4 are fixed: B (1), A (2), S (3), I (4)
- Position 5 must be a letter that completes the word, cannot be L (excluded), and from common words, only ""basis"" works.
- Therefore, <guess>basis</guess> is the next logical guess.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)**  
     - A is in the word but not in position 3.
     - C, R, N, E are not in the word.
   - **Guess 2: ""about"" → Feedback: A(-), B(-), O(x), U(x), T(x)**  
     - A is in the word but not in position 1.
     - B is in the word but not in position 2.
     - O, U, T are not in the word.
   - **Guess 3: ""basil"" → Feedback: B(✓), A(✓), S(✓), I(✓), L(x)**  
     - B is correct at position 1.
     - A is correct at position 2.
     - S is correct at position 3.
     - I is correct at position 4.
     - L is not in the word (so L is excluded).

2. **Deductions**:
   - Positions 1–4 are confirmed: **B** (position 1), **A** (position 2), **S** (position 3), **I** (position 4). Therefore, the secret word starts with ""BASI_"" and only position 5 is unknown.
   - Excluded letters (based on all feedback):
     - Already excluded: C, E, R, N, O, U, T (from guesses 1 and 2).
     - L is now also excluded (from guess 3, L(x)).
     - Total excluded: **C, E, L, N, O, R, T, U**.
   - Position 5 must be a letter from the remaining English alphabet, avoiding excluded letters. Possible letters: D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and any other not excluded, but focus on common).
   - Only common English words starting with ""BASI"" are: ""BASIC"", ""BASIL"", ""BASIN"", ""BASIS"". Testing against constraints:
     - ""BASIC"": Ends with C, but C is excluded → invalid.
     - ""BASIL"": Ends with L, but L is excluded → invalid.
     - ""BASIN"": Ends with N, but N is excluded → invalid.
     - ""BASIS"": Ends with S. S is not excluded (only position 3 was confirmed ✓, but duplicates are possible). This is the only viable option.
   - If the secret word is ""BASIS"":
     - Position 5 is S. Since S is already in position 3 (confirmed ✓), the secret word could have multiple S's (e.g., two S's allowed). Feedback would confirm position 5 S as ✓ if correct or provide other clues.

3. **Strategy for Guess 4**:
   - With positions 1–4 fixed and only position 5 unknown, ""BASIS"" must be tested.
   - A correct guess ends the game.
   - If incorrect, feedback on position 5 will reveal the missing letter (e.g., if marked ""x"", it rules out S, requiring another guess).

Given constraints, ""BASIS"" is the only possible word. Guessing it now.

<guess>basis</guess>",basis,"We are on guess 4 now. Previous guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word, not at position 3.
- C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""about"" → A(-), B(-), O(x), U(x), T(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word, not at position 1.
- B is in the word, not at position 2.
- O, U, T are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""basil"" → B(✓), A(✓), S(✓), I(✓), L(x)
Meaning:
- B at position 1 is correct (✓).
- A at position 2 is correct (✓).
- S at position 3 is correct (✓).
- I at position 4 is correct (✓).
- L is not in the word (x), so L(x).

So from this feedback:
- Positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all correct: B, A, S, I respectively.
- Position 5 is not L, so we need to find the letter for position 5.
- Since positions 1-4 are correct, the secret word is "" B A S I _ "".
- The letter at position 5 must not be L (from L(x)), and must not be any of the previously excluded letters: C,E,R,N,O,U,T (from previous feedback).
- Additionally, since L is x, L is not in the word at all.

We know from guess 3 that:
- Position 1: B (correct)
- Position 2: A (correct)
- Position 3: S (correct)
- Position 4: I (correct)
- Position 5: unknown, but incorrect for L.

Therefore, the secret word is ""BAS I _"", and we need to guess the last letter.

Possible letters for position 5: must be from the English alphabet, excluding forbidden letters.

Forbidden letters:
- Known not in word: C,E,R,N,O,U,T,L (from feedback).
- Other letters excluded? We don't have complete list yet.

We also know that A is at position 2, and in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and gave -, but now we know position is correct.

Now, for position 5: we need a letter that:
- Is not excluded: so avoid C,E,N,R,O,U,T,L.
- Must form a valid English word with ""BASI"".

Possible words ending with ""BAS I"" : BAS I + ? Let's think of words that start with ""B A S I"".

Short words: ""BASIC"" - but C is excluded? C is forbidden since guess 1 C(x), so not. Also ends with C.

""BASIL"" we guessed and L is excluded? L(x) from guess 3.

""BASIS"" ends with S? B,A,S,I,S → positions 1:B,2:A,3:S,4:I,5:S. But S at position 5? In guess 3, we have S at position 3 which is ✓, but the word ""BASIS"" has S at position 5 as well? That might be possible.

Check feedback: in guess 3 (""basil""), S at position 3 is marked ✓, but it doesn't say anything about having multiple S's? The secret word might have another S? Not necessarily.

But in feedback for ""basil"": S is at position 3 and marked correct; position 5 was L, marked x. But if we guess a word with S at position 5, since S is already in word (position 3), but position 5 might be correct or not for that S instance.

But let's see possibilities.

First, "" BASIS"" : it would be B,A,S,I,S → so letter at pos5 is S.

Is S allowed? We don't know if S can be duplicated? The secret word might have only one S? Unclear.

Another word: ""BASIN"" N at end? N forbidden from guess 1.

""N"" is excluded.

""BASIL"" L excluded.

""BASIC"" C excluded.

Other possibilities: what about ""BASIS""? Or ""BASIS"" exists.

But S: from guess 3, we know that S is at position 3, but position 5 is different.

If we guess ""BASIS"", it would test if position 5 is S.

Since no feedback indicated multiple S, it could be.

But let's list all possible words starting with ""BASI"" and last letter not forbidden.

Forbidden: C,E,R,N,O,U,T,L.

So possible letters: D,F,G,H,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now, which of these can form words?

- D: ""BASID"" not a word.
- F: ""BASIF"" no.
- G: ""BASIG"" no.
- H: ""BASIH"" no. ""BASH"" is 4 letters.
- K: ""BASIK"" no. ""BASIC"" C excluded.
- M: ""BASIM"" no. Perhaps ""BASIM"" not a word.
- P: ""BASIP"" not. ""BASIP"" ?
- Q: no.
- V: ""BASIV"" not.
- W: ""BAS I W"" not.
- X: ""BASIX"" not common; ""BASIX"" might be brand, not typical word.
- Y: ""BASI Y""? ""BASIFY"" >5 letters. ""BASIS"" has S, but S not ending.
- Z: ""BASIZ"" not.

Perhaps I missed something.

What five-letter words start with ""BASI""?

Common ones: ""BASIC"", ""BASIL"", ""BASIS"", ""BASIN"".

But ""BASIC"" C excluded, ""BASIL"" L excluded, ""BASIN"" N excluded.

""BASIS"" is the remaining: B,A,S,I,S → ends with S.

But S: in guess 3, S at position 3 is correct, but that doesn't prevent S from being at other positions? Only if ""x"" indicated not present, but here S was confirmed at pos3.

In the secret word, if it has only one S, at position 3, then position 5 S would be incorrect? But since S is already present, position 5 might be marked as ""-"" if S is elsewhere, or ""x"" if not duplicated? But feedback might mark it accordingly.

However, ""BASIS"" is a valid word.

Another possibility: ""BASED"" E,D? E excluded, so no.

""BACCY"" not.

Perhaps non-standard, but we must use English words.

What about ""BASIJ"" not English.

Is there ""B A S I K""? No, ""BASIC"" only.

Perhaps I have it wrong: the word is ""BAS I"" followed by a letter, so four letters fixed: B,A,S,I.

Position 5 must complete the word.

Possible: - S: ""BASIS"" (but double S)

Or - H: ""BASHI"" might be a word? ""Bashi"" is a term in some contexts, like in Japanese or Turkish? But Wordle typically uses common English words. ""Bashi"" might not be accepted.

- M: ""BASIS"" with M? ""BASIM"" not a word.

List all English words ending in I, but with prefix BAS? Difficult.

Perhaps I misunderstand: the secret word has positions 1-4 fixed: B at 1, A at 2, S at 3, I at 4, so ""BAS I"" as in ""BAS"" + I at fourth position.

Then fifth position.

Words: ""BASIC"", ""BASIL"", ""BASIN"", ""BASIS"" — that's about it for common words.

- ""BASID"" not

- ""BASIJ"" not

"" BASIS"" seems the only possible, but it has S at position 5.

In ""BASIS"", position 5 is S.

Now, S is already in the word at position 3.

Is ""BASIS"" a valid guess? Yes, it is a word.

Feedback: if secret is ""BASIC"", but C excluded, can't be.

Similarly, ""BASIL"" L excluded.

""BASIN"" N excluded.

So only ""BASIS"" left? But L is excluded, so ""BASIS"" must be it.

Unless I missed some word.

""BAKED"" but K,E—E excluded; no.

Possible that position 5 is Y or something else? ""BASIY"" not word.

""BASTI"" T excluded, since T(x) in guess 2.

T forbidden.

""BASIP"" not.

Perhaps ""BASIT"" T excluded.

Another word: ""FOCI"" not.

I think only ""BASIS"" is possible when we ignore forbidden letters, but we have forbidden letters, and ""BASIS"" uses S twice.

So we need to guess ""basis""?""

But let's confirm the feedback rules.

If we guess ""basis"":
- Position 1: B → should be ✓ (since correct in previous)
- Position 2: A → ✓
- Position 3: S → ✓
- Position 4: I → ✓
- Position 5: S

Now, if the secret word has S at only position 3, then position 5 S would be incorrect? But since S is already in the word, it might be marked as ""-"" if S can be duplicated? Or ""x"" if not present elsewhere.

But in Wordle, if the secret word has only one S, and you guess S in another position, it will be marked ""-"" if the letter is present elsewhere, or ""x"" if not; but if not present at that position, and not duplicated, it depends.

Standard rule: if the secret has a letter once, and you guess that letter twice, for the second occurrence, if it's not in the word in that position or anywhere, it might be marked ""x"".

But here, since S is in the secret, but only one S (at position 3), then position 5 S should be marked ""-"" only if that position is wrong and there is another S instance? Let's recall.

Feedback symbols:
- ✓: correct letter and correct position.
- -: letter is in the word but wrong position (and for duplicates, it might be marked as such).
- x: letter not in the word.

For duplicates: if secret has one S, and you guess two S's, the first S (at correct position) is ✓, the second S at wrong position might be marked ""x"" if not in word, or ""-"" if it could be considered? But since there is only one S in secret, but already used, the second S should be marked ""x"" because it doesn't exist? So, in guess, when you guess a letter multiple times, feedback accounts for each occurrence:

- If secret has one S: only the correct position S gets ✓ or possibly other if position wrong; but for each occurrence, it is evaluated separately.

For example, secret: STEAL, guess: STEEL → S✓, T✓, E✓ (position correct), E(position wrong? Second E: letter E is in word, but the second E is not used, so secret has only one E, guess has two E's: first E at pos3 is correct ✓, second E at pos4 is not correct, and since no other E in secret, it should be x? Or?

Actually, Wordle handles duplicates: for each letter in guess, it checks if it matches in secret position-wise, then unmatched letters are checked for presence.

Simple rule: position-based.

But for simplicity, in this feedback format, we need to infer.

In our case, for ""basis"" guess, if secret has one S at position 3:
- Pos1 B ✓
- Pos2 A ✓
- Pos3 S ✓
- Pos4 I ✓
- Pos5 S: since secret has no S at position 5, and only one S (at pos3), which is already matched, so S at pos5 should be x (not present) or -?

I think feedback would mark it as: since there is no second S in secret, S at position 5 is not present in the word, so marked ""x"". So ""BASIS"" with S at pos5 would give x for that position if secret has only one S.

But we don't know if secret has multiple S; it could have.

In guess 3 (""basil""), we have S at position 3 marked ✓, but secret could have another S? Possible.

For position 5, we need to guess a letter.

If only ""BASIS"" is possible common word, perhaps it is.

But not her  letters.

Maybe I missed a word.

Another possibility: ""BAST I"" T excluded.

"" BARK I"" no.

Perhaps ""BASIN"" N excluded.

List of words: possible 5-letter words starting with BASI.

On average: BASIS, BASIC, BASIL, BASIN.

All others seem non-standard.

With Y: ""BAS I Y"" not.

Therefore, likely ""BASIS"" is the word, and we should guess it.

And since L is excluded, and others, so position 5 is S.

But in secret, If position 5 is S, then it has two S's; in guess 3, we had L at position 5 which is x, so S could be at position 5.

Feedback for ""basil"" showed L(x), meaning L not in word, but S at position 3 is in correct position.

Secret is ""BASIS"".

We can guess ""basis"".

But et's assume that is the only possibility.

So for guess 4, ""basis"".

But we have only a few guesses left, but we know position 5 must be filled.

If we guess ""basis"" and it is the secret, we win.

If not, feedback will tell.

But based on deduction, it must be ""basis"" given the constraints.

Other letters: for example, K: but ""BASIK"" not word.

G: ""BASIG"" no.

So I think ""basis"" is the guess.

Recap:
- Secret word positions 1-4: B, A, S, I are confirmed correct and in place, so far.
- Position 5: L is incorrect and not in the word, so secret must be ""BASI?"" 
- Excluded letters: C, E, R, N, O, U, T, L
- Possible words: Only ""BASIS"" fits as a common English word that matches the known prefix and avoids excluded letters.
  - ""BASIC"" (C excluded)
  - ""BASIL"" (L excluded)
  - ""BASIN"" (N excluded)
  - Thus, ""basis"" is the only reasonable candidate.

Guess ""basis"": Since positions 1-4 are already correct, they will remain ✓, and position 5 will be S—this should be ✓ if correct.
</thought>

<guess>basis</guess>Previous feedback confirms:
- Positions 1 to 4 are fixed: B (1), A (2), S (3), I (4)
- Position 5 must be a letter that completes the word, cannot be L (excluded), and from common words, only ""basis"" works.
- Therefore, <guess>basis</guess> is the next logical guess.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)**  
     - A is in the word but not in position 3.
     - C, R, N, E are not in the word.
   - **Guess 2: ""about"" → Feedback: A(-), B(-), O(x), U(x), T(x)**  
     - A is in the word but not in position 1.
     - B is in the word but not in position 2.
     - O, U, T are not in the word.
   - **Guess 3: ""basil"" → Feedback: B(✓), A(✓), S(✓), I(✓), L(x)**  
     - B is correct at position 1.
     - A is correct at position 2.
     - S is correct at position 3.
     - I is correct at position 4.
     - L is not in the word (so L is excluded).

2. **Deductions**:
   - Positions 1–4 are confirmed: **B** (position 1), **A** (position 2), **S** (position 3), **I** (position 4). Therefore, the secret word starts with ""BASI_"" and only position 5 is unknown.
   - Excluded letters (based on all feedback):
     - Already excluded: C, E, R, N, O, U, T (from guesses 1 and 2).
     - L is now also excluded (from guess 3, L(x)).
     - Total excluded: **C, E, L, N, O, R, T, U**.
   - Position 5 must be a letter from the remaining English alphabet, avoiding excluded letters. Possible letters: D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and any other not excluded, but focus on common).
   - Only common English words starting with ""BASI"" are: ""BASIC"", ""BASIL"", ""BASIN"", ""BASIS"". Testing against constraints:
     - ""BASIC"": Ends with C, but C is excluded → invalid.
     - ""BASIL"": Ends with L, but L is excluded → invalid.
     - ""BASIN"": Ends with N, but N is excluded → invalid.
     - ""BASIS"": Ends with S. S is not excluded (only position 3 was confirmed ✓, but duplicates are possible). This is the only viable option.
   - If the secret word is ""BASIS"":
     - Position 5 is S. Since S is already in position 3 (confirmed ✓), the secret word could have multiple S's (e.g., two S's allowed). Feedback would confirm position 5 S as ✓ if correct or provide other clues.

3. **Strategy for Guess 4**:
   - With positions 1–4 fixed and only position 5 unknown, ""BASIS"" must be tested.
   - A correct guess ends the game.
   - If incorrect, feedback on position 5 will reveal the missing letter (e.g., if marked ""x"", it rules out S, requiring another guess).

Given constraints, ""BASIS"" is the only possible word. Guessing it now.",Guess 4: basis -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) A(✓) S(✓) I(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
