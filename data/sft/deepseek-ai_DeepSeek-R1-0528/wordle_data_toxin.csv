We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to make an initial guess.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter 'N' is in the secret word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""crane"" it was at the 4th and got a '-' meaning present but wrong spot).
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'N' and does not contain C, R, A, E.

 We have to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
 1. Includes 'N' (since we know it's in the word) but not in the 4th position (because in the first guess it was in the 4th and was wrong position).
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, E.
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Let's think of common letters that are not C, R, A, E. Some common letters in English 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

 We also know that 'N' must be in the word. So we can try to put 'N' in a different position.

 Possible positions for 'N': since it was in the 4th position in ""crane"" and that was wrong, we can try positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 However, note that the feedback does not tell us how many times a letter appears. So the word might have one 'N' or more? But we only know one is present.

 We should also try to include other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Let's try to form a word that has:
 - 'N' in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4)
 - and uses letters from: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""saint"" but note that 'A' is not allowed (we know A is not in the word) -> so avoid A.
 - ""point"": P, O, I, N, T -> but note we haven't tried P, O, I, T. However, we must avoid A, C, R, E (which we are). Also, we can put 'N' in the 4th position? But wait, in the first guess we had 'N' in the 4th and it was wrong. So if we put 'N' in the 4th again, it would be the same position and we know it's wrong. So we should avoid the 4th position for 'N'. Therefore, we cannot use ""point"" because it has 'N' in the 4th.

 We need a word with 'N' not in the 4th.

 Let's think of words with 'N' in the 1st: ""night"", ""nasty"" (but avoid A), ""noble"", ""noisy"" (but avoid A? no, A is not in the word so we can use other vowels? Actually, we know A is not in the word, but we can use O, I, U, etc.)

 But note: we also know that the word does not have A, so we must avoid A.

 Let's try ""noisy"": N, O, I, S, Y -> but has O, I, S, Y. However, we don't know about these. But wait, ""noisy"" has an 'S' and 'Y'. Also, we can check if it's valid.

 Alternatively, we can try ""snowy"": S, N, O, W, Y -> but then 'N' is in the 2nd position. That's acceptable.

 However, we must avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, E. ""snowy"" doesn't have any of these.

 Another option: ""linen"" -> but note we have two N's? And we don't know if the word has two N's. Also, we have an 'E' which we know is absent? So we cannot use 'E'. So ""linen"" is invalid because of E.

 We must avoid E as well.

 So, let's list some words without A, C, R, E and with one 'N' (or possibly two, but we don't know) and with 'N' not in the 4th.

 Words:
 - ""nymph"": N, Y, M, P, H -> but that's a valid word? Yes. And 'N' is in the 1st position.
 - ""dingy"": D, I, N, G, Y -> 'N' in the 3rd position. Avoids A, C, R, E.

 But we don't know if the word has D, I, G, Y, etc.

 Another idea: we want to test as many new common letters as possible. Common letters: S, T, L, O, P, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that has 'N' and also includes S, T, L, O, etc.

 Example: ""tonal"" -> but has A (which is absent) -> invalid.
 Example: ""stony"": S, T, O, N, Y -> 'N' in the 4th? We must avoid 4th for N? But wait, we know that in the first guess the 4th position was wrong for N, but if the word has two N's? Then it might be that the 4th position is also N and we get a match? But we don't know. However, the feedback only tells us that there is at least one N and it's not in the 4th. So if we put N in the 4th again, it might be that the word has only one N and then we get a '-' again (if the N is in a different position) or if the word has two N's and one of them is in the 4th, then we might get a check. But we don't know.

 However, to avoid confusion, it's better to try a word that has 'N' in a new position to get more information about the position of N.

 So, let's avoid the 4th position for now.

 Therefore, ""stony"" is not ideal because it has N in the 4th.

 How about ""stint"": S, T, I, N, T -> but has two T's? And N in the 4th? Again, same issue.

 How about ""mount"": M, O, U, N, T -> N in the 4th? Same.

 How about ""doing"": D, O, I, N, G -> N in the 4th? Same.

 We need to avoid the 4th for N? But we can try it if we have to, but let's try to find a word without N in the 4th.

 How about ""ninth"": N, I, N, T, H -> has two N's? And the first N is in the 1st, and the third letter is N. But we don't know if the word has two N's. Also, we are avoiding A, C, R, E. This word is valid.

 But note: we have two N's. We know at least one N is present. If the word has two N's, then we might get feedback for both. However, we are not sure.

 Alternatively, we can try ""sling"": S, L, I, N, G -> N in the 4th? Again.

 It's hard to avoid the 4th? Maybe we should not avoid the 4th? Because the feedback for the first guess only said that the N in the 4th was wrong, but if the word has two N's, then the 4th might be correct? Actually, no: the feedback for the first guess: the N was in the 4th and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that the secret word has an N, but not in the 4th position. Therefore, if we put N in the 4th again, it will definitely be wrong (because the secret word doesn't have an N in the 4th). So we should avoid the 4th position for N.

 Therefore, we must choose a word that has N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 Let me try to think of words with N in the 5th? That's less common. Example: ""grown"", ""flown"", ""brown"", but we don't know if these letters are allowed.

 But we can use: ""grown"": G, R, O, W, N -> but wait, R is in the word? We know from the first guess that R is not in the word (because we had R in ""crane"" and it was marked x). So we cannot use R.

 Similarly, we cannot use R.

 So, avoid R.

 How about ""brown"": B, R, O, W, N -> has R -> invalid.

 How about ""flown"": F, L, O, W, N -> has L, O, W, N. And no R? But wait, we don't have R? Actually, we know R is absent. So ""flown"" has R? No, ""flown"" is F, L, O, W, N -> no R. But we also must avoid A, C, E. This word is okay.

 However, we have N in the 5th. That's a new position.

 But we don't know about F, L, O, W.

 Alternatively, we can try ""known"": K, N, O, W, N -> has two N's? And N in the 1st and 5th? But we are allowed to have two N's? And we know the word has at least one N. This word is valid.

 But let me choose a word that has more common letters. We haven't tested S, T, L, O, etc.

 How about ""snowy"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N in the 2nd position. This is acceptable.

 We can use ""snowy"". It avoids A, C, R, E. It has S, N, O, W, Y.

 Another option: ""nobly"": N, O, B, L, Y -> N in the 1st. This is also good.

 Let me choose between these.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible. Common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, N, O (but we already know N is in, and we are using O). Also, we haven't tested T? So maybe we should include T.

 How about ""notch"": but has C and H? We know C is absent, so invalid.

 How about ""tonic"": has C and T, O, N, I -> but C is absent -> invalid.

 How about ""joint"": J, O, I, N, T -> N in the 4th? We must avoid 4th for N -> so no.

 How about ""point"": again, N in the 4th -> avoid.

 How about ""night"": N, I, G, H, T -> N in the 1st. This is good. And we avoid A, C, R, E. It has I, G, H, T.

 But we don't know about these letters.

 Alternatively, ""sight"": S, I, G, H, T -> but no N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we cannot use ""sight"".

 So, we must include N.

 Therefore, ""night"" is a candidate.

 Another candidate: ""thing"": T, H, I, N, G -> N in the 4th? Avoid.

 How about ""tinge"": but has E -> invalid.

 How about ""sting"": S, T, I, N, G -> N in the 4th? Avoid.

 How about ""singe"": has E -> invalid.

 How about ""minim"": M, I, N, I, M -> has two M's and two I's? And N in the 3rd. This is acceptable? But it's a rare word.

 We want a common word.

 Let me go with ""night"" or ""snowy"". 

 I think ""snowy"" is a good choice because it has common letters and N in the 2nd (a new position). Also, it uses S, O, W, Y which we haven't tried.

 Alternatively, we can try ""downy"": D, O, W, N, Y -> N in the 4th? Avoid.

 How about ""windy"": W, I, N, D, Y -> N in the 3rd. This is acceptable.

 But ""windy"" has D and Y. We haven't tried D and Y.

 However, I think ""snowy"" is a better choice because it has S which is a very common letter.

 So, I'll go with ""snowy"".

 But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""snowy"" is a valid English word.

 Therefore, second guess: ""snowy""

 We'll get feedback on S, N, O, W, Y.

 Let's write it in the required format.
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- N is present but not in the 4th position (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- Must include ""N"" (since it's confirmed present) but avoid placing it in the 4th position.
- Must exclude C, R, A, and E (confirmed absent).
- Should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, L, Y) to maximize information.
- Avoid repeating the 4th-position placement for ""N"" to test new positions.

The word ""snowy"" fits these criteria:
- Contains ""N"" in the 2nd position (new slot).
- Uses new common letters: S, O, W, Y.
- Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess will help identify the position of ""N"" and test four additional letters.

<guess>snowy</guess>",snowy,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter 'N' is in the secret word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""crane"" it was at the 4th and got a '-' meaning present but wrong spot).
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'N' and does not contain C, R, A, E.

 We have to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
 1. Includes 'N' (since we know it's in the word) but not in the 4th position (because in the first guess it was in the 4th and was wrong position).
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, E.
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Let's think of common letters that are not C, R, A, E. Some common letters in English 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

 We also know that 'N' must be in the word. So we can try to put 'N' in a different position.

 Possible positions for 'N': since it was in the 4th position in ""crane"" and that was wrong, we can try positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 However, note that the feedback does not tell us how many times a letter appears. So the word might have one 'N' or more? But we only know one is present.

 We should also try to include other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Let's try to form a word that has:
 - 'N' in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4)
 - and uses letters from: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""saint"" but note that 'A' is not allowed (we know A is not in the word) -> so avoid A.
 - ""point"": P, O, I, N, T -> but note we haven't tried P, O, I, T. However, we must avoid A, C, R, E (which we are). Also, we can put 'N' in the 4th position? But wait, in the first guess we had 'N' in the 4th and it was wrong. So if we put 'N' in the 4th again, it would be the same position and we know it's wrong. So we should avoid the 4th position for 'N'. Therefore, we cannot use ""point"" because it has 'N' in the 4th.

 We need a word with 'N' not in the 4th.

 Let's think of words with 'N' in the 1st: ""night"", ""nasty"" (but avoid A), ""noble"", ""noisy"" (but avoid A? no, A is not in the word so we can use other vowels? Actually, we know A is not in the word, but we can use O, I, U, etc.)

 But note: we also know that the word does not have A, so we must avoid A.

 Let's try ""noisy"": N, O, I, S, Y -> but has O, I, S, Y. However, we don't know about these. But wait, ""noisy"" has an 'S' and 'Y'. Also, we can check if it's valid.

 Alternatively, we can try ""snowy"": S, N, O, W, Y -> but then 'N' is in the 2nd position. That's acceptable.

 However, we must avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, E. ""snowy"" doesn't have any of these.

 Another option: ""linen"" -> but note we have two N's? And we don't know if the word has two N's. Also, we have an 'E' which we know is absent? So we cannot use 'E'. So ""linen"" is invalid because of E.

 We must avoid E as well.

 So, let's list some words without A, C, R, E and with one 'N' (or possibly two, but we don't know) and with 'N' not in the 4th.

 Words:
 - ""nymph"": N, Y, M, P, H -> but that's a valid word? Yes. And 'N' is in the 1st position.
 - ""dingy"": D, I, N, G, Y -> 'N' in the 3rd position. Avoids A, C, R, E.

 But we don't know if the word has D, I, G, Y, etc.

 Another idea: we want to test as many new common letters as possible. Common letters: S, T, L, O, P, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that has 'N' and also includes S, T, L, O, etc.

 Example: ""tonal"" -> but has A (which is absent) -> invalid.
 Example: ""stony"": S, T, O, N, Y -> 'N' in the 4th? We must avoid 4th for N? But wait, we know that in the first guess the 4th position was wrong for N, but if the word has two N's? Then it might be that the 4th position is also N and we get a match? But we don't know. However, the feedback only tells us that there is at least one N and it's not in the 4th. So if we put N in the 4th again, it might be that the word has only one N and then we get a '-' again (if the N is in a different position) or if the word has two N's and one of them is in the 4th, then we might get a check. But we don't know.

 However, to avoid confusion, it's better to try a word that has 'N' in a new position to get more information about the position of N.

 So, let's avoid the 4th position for now.

 Therefore, ""stony"" is not ideal because it has N in the 4th.

 How about ""stint"": S, T, I, N, T -> but has two T's? And N in the 4th? Again, same issue.

 How about ""mount"": M, O, U, N, T -> N in the 4th? Same.

 How about ""doing"": D, O, I, N, G -> N in the 4th? Same.

 We need to avoid the 4th for N? But we can try it if we have to, but let's try to find a word without N in the 4th.

 How about ""ninth"": N, I, N, T, H -> has two N's? And the first N is in the 1st, and the third letter is N. But we don't know if the word has two N's. Also, we are avoiding A, C, R, E. This word is valid.

 But note: we have two N's. We know at least one N is present. If the word has two N's, then we might get feedback for both. However, we are not sure.

 Alternatively, we can try ""sling"": S, L, I, N, G -> N in the 4th? Again.

 It's hard to avoid the 4th? Maybe we should not avoid the 4th? Because the feedback for the first guess only said that the N in the 4th was wrong, but if the word has two N's, then the 4th might be correct? Actually, no: the feedback for the first guess: the N was in the 4th and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that the secret word has an N, but not in the 4th position. Therefore, if we put N in the 4th again, it will definitely be wrong (because the secret word doesn't have an N in the 4th). So we should avoid the 4th position for N.

 Therefore, we must choose a word that has N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 Let me try to think of words with N in the 5th? That's less common. Example: ""grown"", ""flown"", ""brown"", but we don't know if these letters are allowed.

 But we can use: ""grown"": G, R, O, W, N -> but wait, R is in the word? We know from the first guess that R is not in the word (because we had R in ""crane"" and it was marked x). So we cannot use R.

 Similarly, we cannot use R.

 So, avoid R.

 How about ""brown"": B, R, O, W, N -> has R -> invalid.

 How about ""flown"": F, L, O, W, N -> has L, O, W, N. And no R? But wait, we don't have R? Actually, we know R is absent. So ""flown"" has R? No, ""flown"" is F, L, O, W, N -> no R. But we also must avoid A, C, E. This word is okay.

 However, we have N in the 5th. That's a new position.

 But we don't know about F, L, O, W.

 Alternatively, we can try ""known"": K, N, O, W, N -> has two N's? And N in the 1st and 5th? But we are allowed to have two N's? And we know the word has at least one N. This word is valid.

 But let me choose a word that has more common letters. We haven't tested S, T, L, O, etc.

 How about ""snowy"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N in the 2nd position. This is acceptable.

 We can use ""snowy"". It avoids A, C, R, E. It has S, N, O, W, Y.

 Another option: ""nobly"": N, O, B, L, Y -> N in the 1st. This is also good.

 Let me choose between these.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible. Common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, N, O (but we already know N is in, and we are using O). Also, we haven't tested T? So maybe we should include T.

 How about ""notch"": but has C and H? We know C is absent, so invalid.

 How about ""tonic"": has C and T, O, N, I -> but C is absent -> invalid.

 How about ""joint"": J, O, I, N, T -> N in the 4th? We must avoid 4th for N -> so no.

 How about ""point"": again, N in the 4th -> avoid.

 How about ""night"": N, I, G, H, T -> N in the 1st. This is good. And we avoid A, C, R, E. It has I, G, H, T.

 But we don't know about these letters.

 Alternatively, ""sight"": S, I, G, H, T -> but no N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we cannot use ""sight"".

 So, we must include N.

 Therefore, ""night"" is a candidate.

 Another candidate: ""thing"": T, H, I, N, G -> N in the 4th? Avoid.

 How about ""tinge"": but has E -> invalid.

 How about ""sting"": S, T, I, N, G -> N in the 4th? Avoid.

 How about ""singe"": has E -> invalid.

 How about ""minim"": M, I, N, I, M -> has two M's and two I's? And N in the 3rd. This is acceptable? But it's a rare word.

 We want a common word.

 Let me go with ""night"" or ""snowy"". 

 I think ""snowy"" is a good choice because it has common letters and N in the 2nd (a new position). Also, it uses S, O, W, Y which we haven't tried.

 Alternatively, we can try ""downy"": D, O, W, N, Y -> N in the 4th? Avoid.

 How about ""windy"": W, I, N, D, Y -> N in the 3rd. This is acceptable.

 But ""windy"" has D and Y. We haven't tried D and Y.

 However, I think ""snowy"" is a better choice because it has S which is a very common letter.

 So, I'll go with ""snowy"".

 But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""snowy"" is a valid English word.

 Therefore, second guess: ""snowy""

 We'll get feedback on S, N, O, W, Y.

 Let's write it in the required format.After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- N is present but not in the 4th position (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- Must include ""N"" (since it's confirmed present) but avoid placing it in the 4th position.
- Must exclude C, R, A, and E (confirmed absent).
- Should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, L, Y) to maximize information.
- Avoid repeating the 4th-position placement for ""N"" to test new positions.

The word ""snowy"" fits these criteria:
- Contains ""N"" in the 2nd position (new slot).
- Uses new common letters: S, O, W, Y.
- Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess will help identify the position of ""N"" and test four additional letters.",Guess 2: snowy -> FEEDBACK: S(x) N(-) O(-) W(x) Y(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,toxin,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to make an initial guess.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter 'N' is in the secret word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""crane"" it was at the 4th and got a '-' meaning present but wrong spot).
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'N' and does not contain C, R, A, E.

 We have to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
 1. Includes 'N' (since we know it's in the word) but not in the 4th position (because in the first guess it was in the 4th and was wrong position).
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, E.
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Let's think of common letters that are not C, R, A, E. Some common letters in English 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

 We also know that 'N' must be in the word. So we can try to put 'N' in a different position.

 Possible positions for 'N': since it was in the 4th position in ""crane"" and that was wrong, we can try positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 However, note that the feedback does not tell us how many times a letter appears. So the word might have one 'N' or more? But we only know one is present.

 We should also try to include other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Let's try to form a word that has:
 - 'N' in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4)
 - and uses letters from: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""saint"" but note that 'A' is not allowed (we know A is not in the word) -> so avoid A.
 - ""point"": P, O, I, N, T -> but note we haven't tried P, O, I, T. However, we must avoid A, C, R, E (which we are). Also, we can put 'N' in the 4th position? But wait, in the first guess we had 'N' in the 4th and it was wrong. So if we put 'N' in the 4th again, it would be the same position and we know it's wrong. So we should avoid the 4th position for 'N'. Therefore, we cannot use ""point"" because it has 'N' in the 4th.

 We need a word with 'N' not in the 4th.

 Let's think of words with 'N' in the 1st: ""night"", ""nasty"" (but avoid A), ""noble"", ""noisy"" (but avoid A? no, A is not in the word so we can use other vowels? Actually, we know A is not in the word, but we can use O, I, U, etc.)

 But note: we also know that the word does not have A, so we must avoid A.

 Let's try ""noisy"": N, O, I, S, Y -> but has O, I, S, Y. However, we don't know about these. But wait, ""noisy"" has an 'S' and 'Y'. Also, we can check if it's valid.

 Alternatively, we can try ""snowy"": S, N, O, W, Y -> but then 'N' is in the 2nd position. That's acceptable.

 However, we must avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, E. ""snowy"" doesn't have any of these.

 Another option: ""linen"" -> but note we have two N's? And we don't know if the word has two N's. Also, we have an 'E' which we know is absent? So we cannot use 'E'. So ""linen"" is invalid because of E.

 We must avoid E as well.

 So, let's list some words without A, C, R, E and with one 'N' (or possibly two, but we don't know) and with 'N' not in the 4th.

 Words:
 - ""nymph"": N, Y, M, P, H -> but that's a valid word? Yes. And 'N' is in the 1st position.
 - ""dingy"": D, I, N, G, Y -> 'N' in the 3rd position. Avoids A, C, R, E.

 But we don't know if the word has D, I, G, Y, etc.

 Another idea: we want to test as many new common letters as possible. Common letters: S, T, L, O, P, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that has 'N' and also includes S, T, L, O, etc.

 Example: ""tonal"" -> but has A (which is absent) -> invalid.
 Example: ""stony"": S, T, O, N, Y -> 'N' in the 4th? We must avoid 4th for N? But wait, we know that in the first guess the 4th position was wrong for N, but if the word has two N's? Then it might be that the 4th position is also N and we get a match? But we don't know. However, the feedback only tells us that there is at least one N and it's not in the 4th. So if we put N in the 4th again, it might be that the word has only one N and then we get a '-' again (if the N is in a different position) or if the word has two N's and one of them is in the 4th, then we might get a check. But we don't know.

 However, to avoid confusion, it's better to try a word that has 'N' in a new position to get more information about the position of N.

 So, let's avoid the 4th position for now.

 Therefore, ""stony"" is not ideal because it has N in the 4th.

 How about ""stint"": S, T, I, N, T -> but has two T's? And N in the 4th? Again, same issue.

 How about ""mount"": M, O, U, N, T -> N in the 4th? Same.

 How about ""doing"": D, O, I, N, G -> N in the 4th? Same.

 We need to avoid the 4th for N? But we can try it if we have to, but let's try to find a word without N in the 4th.

 How about ""ninth"": N, I, N, T, H -> has two N's? And the first N is in the 1st, and the third letter is N. But we don't know if the word has two N's. Also, we are avoiding A, C, R, E. This word is valid.

 But note: we have two N's. We know at least one N is present. If the word has two N's, then we might get feedback for both. However, we are not sure.

 Alternatively, we can try ""sling"": S, L, I, N, G -> N in the 4th? Again.

 It's hard to avoid the 4th? Maybe we should not avoid the 4th? Because the feedback for the first guess only said that the N in the 4th was wrong, but if the word has two N's, then the 4th might be correct? Actually, no: the feedback for the first guess: the N was in the 4th and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that the secret word has an N, but not in the 4th position. Therefore, if we put N in the 4th again, it will definitely be wrong (because the secret word doesn't have an N in the 4th). So we should avoid the 4th position for N.

 Therefore, we must choose a word that has N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 Let me try to think of words with N in the 5th? That's less common. Example: ""grown"", ""flown"", ""brown"", but we don't know if these letters are allowed.

 But we can use: ""grown"": G, R, O, W, N -> but wait, R is in the word? We know from the first guess that R is not in the word (because we had R in ""crane"" and it was marked x). So we cannot use R.

 Similarly, we cannot use R.

 So, avoid R.

 How about ""brown"": B, R, O, W, N -> has R -> invalid.

 How about ""flown"": F, L, O, W, N -> has L, O, W, N. And no R? But wait, we don't have R? Actually, we know R is absent. So ""flown"" has R? No, ""flown"" is F, L, O, W, N -> no R. But we also must avoid A, C, E. This word is okay.

 However, we have N in the 5th. That's a new position.

 But we don't know about F, L, O, W.

 Alternatively, we can try ""known"": K, N, O, W, N -> has two N's? And N in the 1st and 5th? But we are allowed to have two N's? And we know the word has at least one N. This word is valid.

 But let me choose a word that has more common letters. We haven't tested S, T, L, O, etc.

 How about ""snowy"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N in the 2nd position. This is acceptable.

 We can use ""snowy"". It avoids A, C, R, E. It has S, N, O, W, Y.

 Another option: ""nobly"": N, O, B, L, Y -> N in the 1st. This is also good.

 Let me choose between these.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible. Common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, N, O (but we already know N is in, and we are using O). Also, we haven't tested T? So maybe we should include T.

 How about ""notch"": but has C and H? We know C is absent, so invalid.

 How about ""tonic"": has C and T, O, N, I -> but C is absent -> invalid.

 How about ""joint"": J, O, I, N, T -> N in the 4th? We must avoid 4th for N -> so no.

 How about ""point"": again, N in the 4th -> avoid.

 How about ""night"": N, I, G, H, T -> N in the 1st. This is good. And we avoid A, C, R, E. It has I, G, H, T.

 But we don't know about these letters.

 Alternatively, ""sight"": S, I, G, H, T -> but no N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we cannot use ""sight"".

 So, we must include N.

 Therefore, ""night"" is a candidate.

 Another candidate: ""thing"": T, H, I, N, G -> N in the 4th? Avoid.

 How about ""tinge"": but has E -> invalid.

 How about ""sting"": S, T, I, N, G -> N in the 4th? Avoid.

 How about ""singe"": has E -> invalid.

 How about ""minim"": M, I, N, I, M -> has two M's and two I's? And N in the 3rd. This is acceptable? But it's a rare word.

 We want a common word.

 Let me go with ""night"" or ""snowy"". 

 I think ""snowy"" is a good choice because it has common letters and N in the 2nd (a new position). Also, it uses S, O, W, Y which we haven't tried.

 Alternatively, we can try ""downy"": D, O, W, N, Y -> N in the 4th? Avoid.

 How about ""windy"": W, I, N, D, Y -> N in the 3rd. This is acceptable.

 But ""windy"" has D and Y. We haven't tried D and Y.

 However, I think ""snowy"" is a better choice because it has S which is a very common letter.

 So, I'll go with ""snowy"".

 But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""snowy"" is a valid English word.

 Therefore, second guess: ""snowy""

 We'll get feedback on S, N, O, W, Y.

 Let's write it in the required format.After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- N is present but not in the 4th position (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- Must include ""N"" (since it's confirmed present) but avoid placing it in the 4th position.
- Must exclude C, R, A, and E (confirmed absent).
- Should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, L, Y) to maximize information.
- Avoid repeating the 4th-position placement for ""N"" to test new positions.

The word ""snowy"" fits these criteria:
- Contains ""N"" in the 2nd position (new slot).
- Uses new common letters: S, O, W, Y.
- Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess will help identify the position of ""N"" and test four additional letters.

It has I, G, H, T.\n\n But we don\'t know about these letters.\n\n Alternatively, ""sight"": S, I, G, H, T -> but no N? We must include N because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot use ""sight"".\n\n So, we must include N.\n\n Therefore, ""night"" is a candidate.\n\n Another candidate: ""thing"": T, H, I, N, G -> N in the 4th? Avoid.\n\n How about ""tinge"": but has E -> invalid.\n\n How about ""sting"": S, T, I, N, G -> N in the 4th? Avoid.\n\n How about ""singe"": has E -> invalid.\n\n How about ""minim"": M, I, N, I, M -> has two M\'s and two I\'s? And N in the 3rd. This is acceptable? But it\'s a rare word.\n\n We want a common word.\n\n Let me go with ""night"" or ""snowy"". \n\n I think ""snowy"" is a good choice because it has common letters and N in the 2nd (a new position). Also, it uses S, O, W, Y which we haven\'t tried.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""downy"": D, O, W, N, Y -> N in the 4th? Avoid.\n\n How about ""windy"": W, I, N, D, Y -> N in the 3rd. This is acceptable.\n\n But ""windy"" has D and Y. We haven\'t tried D and Y.\n\n However, I think ""snowy"" is a better choice because it has S which is a very common letter.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""snowy"".\n\n But wait, we have to make sure it\'s a valid word. Yes, ""snowy"" is a valid English word.\n\n Therefore, second guess: ""snowy""\n\n We\'ll get feedback on S, N, O, W, Y.\n\n Let\'s write it in the required format.After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and E are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- N is present but not in the 4th position (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include ""N"" (since it\'s confirmed present) but avoid placing it in the 4th position.\n- Must exclude C, R, A, and E (confirmed absent).\n- Should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, L, Y) to maximize information.\n- Avoid repeating the 4th-position placement for ""N"" to test new positions.\n\nThe word ""snowy"" fits these criteria:\n- Contains ""N"" in the 2nd position (new slot).\n- Uses new common letters: S, O, W, Y.\n- Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).\n- Is a valid 5-letter English word.\n\nThis guess will help identify the position of ""N"" and test four additional letters.\n\n<guess>snowy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: snowy -> FEEDBACK: S(x) N(-) O(-) W(x) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C, R, A, E: absent (x)
- N: present, but not in the 4th position (so in the word somewhere else)

Second guess: ""snowy""
- S, W, Y: absent (x)
- N: present but not in the 2nd position (where we placed it in ""snowy"")
- O: present but not in the 3rd position (where we placed it in ""snowy"")

So, combining the information:

Letters known to be absent: C, R, A, E, S, W, Y
Letters known to be present: N and O

We also know that:
- N is in the word, but not in position 4 (from ""crane"") and not in position 2 (from ""snowy"")
- O is in the word, but not in position 3 (from ""snowy"")

Now, we need to guess a word that:
- Contains N and O (since they are present)
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, E, S, W, Y
- Places N not in position 2 or 4
- Places O not in position 3

We must use only the remaining letters. English letters available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z (but we should prioritize common ones)

Also, we need to consider the positions for N and O.

Possible positions for N: 1, 3, or 5 (since 2 and 4 are excluded)
Possible positions for O: any except 3? Actually, position 3 is excluded for O, so positions 1,2,4,5 are possible for O? But we don't know if O can be in 2, etc.

But note: we don't have any constraints on other positions yet.

Now, we know the word has at least N and O, and we have to guess using the available letters.

Let's think of common 5-letter words with N and O, avoiding the bad letters.

Also, since from ""crane"" we had N present, and in ""snowy"" we also have N present, but with different positions, and same for O (only appeared in ""snowy"").

We can try to include other common letters to test: such as T, L, I, etc.

Possible words:

- ""point"": but has P, O, I, N, T -> but we must avoid A, C, R, E, S, W, Y. ""point""? It has P,O,I,N,T. None of the forbidden letters? But wait: C, R, A, E, S, W, Y are absent, so P, O, I, N, T are acceptable. Also, positions: in ""point"", N is in position 4? But we know from first guess that N cannot be in position 4! So if we put ""point"", and N is in 4th, then it cannot be correct because N is not in position 4? Therefore, we avoid words with N in position 4.

Similarly, in ""point"", O is in position 2? That might be okay because we don't have constraint against position 2 for O? But for O, we only know it's not in position 3. So position 2 is possible.

But N is in position 4 in ""point"", which is forbidden (because we know N is not in 4th). So we cannot use ""point"" because we know N is not in the 4th?

Wait, but if the word is ""point"", then in the first guess ""crane"" we had N in the 4th and got a '-' meaning N is in the word but not in that position. If ""point"" has N in the 4th, then for the first guess (if the word was ""point"") the feedback would have been for N: if N is in the 4th then it should be a check, but we got a '-' meaning it's not in the 4th? Contradiction? So the word cannot be ""point"" because we know N is not in position 4.

Therefore, we must avoid any word that has N in position 4 because we know that position is wrong.

Similarly, for position 2: we know from ""snowy"" that N is not in position 2? So we also avoid position 2 for N.

Therefore, N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Similarly, O must not be in position 3? So O must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We need a word that has both N and O with N in 1,3, or 5 and O in 1,2,4,5, but also avoiding forbidden letters.

And the word must not use any of the absent letters.

Now, let's list possibilities:

- Option 1: N in position 1, O in position 2: e.g., ""NO???"" 
  - But forbidden letters: avoid A, C, E, R, S, W, Y. So words like ""noble"" has A? Wait, ""noble"" has A? Actually, ""noble"" is N,O,B,L,E -> E is forbidden, invalid.
  - ""nodal"": has A and L? ""nodal"" is N,O,D,A,L -> A is forbidden? Wait, A is absent, so we cannot use A. So invalid.
  - ""noisy"": but S and Y are forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""nomad"": has A, invalid.
  - ""noble"": has E, invalid.
  - ""noted"": has E, invalid.
  - ""north"": has R? R is forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""novel"": has E? Invalid.

It's hard? How about N in 1 and O in 4: e.g., ""N??O?""
  - For example, ""nitro"": but R and T? R forbidden -> invalid.

Alternatively, N in 1 and O in 5: e.g., ""N???O""
  - Words like ""nacho"": has A, C -> invalid.
  - ""nacho"" has A and C -> both forbidden.
  - Or ""neato"": has A,E -> both forbidden.

Not working? How about N in position 3 and O in another position?

Let me try N in position 3: so ""??N??""

And O can be in 1,2,4,5.

For example, O in 1, N in 3: ""O?N??"" 
  - Words: ""owner"": has W and R? W forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""oink"": not 5 letters? Must be 5 letters.

""oinks"": has S -> invalid.

O in 2, N in 3: ""?ON??""
  - Words: ""bonus"": has B, O, N, U, S -> S is forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""tonic"": has T, O, N, I, C -> C is forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""donut"": has D, O, N, U, T -> no forbidden letters? Wait, letters: D, O, N, U, T. Avoided A,C,E,R,S,W,Y -> so allowed? But we don't know about U. But it's possible.

""donut"" is a word, and has O in 2nd, N in 3rd? But we also have U and T.

Is that okay? Yes.

Another word: ""going"": has G,O,I,N,G -> but N in 4th? Avoid N in 4th? We need N in position 3? In ""going"": positions: G(1),O(2),I(3),N(4),G(4? wait: going is G,O,I,N,G -> so positions:1:G,2:O,3:I,4:N,5:G -> so N is in 4th, which is forbidden? Yes. So we avoid.

N in position 3: so third letter must be N.

So for ""?ON??"": example ""bonus"" has S -> invalid.
  - ""font"": not 5 letters.
  - ""front"": has R -> invalid.
  - ""mound"": has M,O,U,N,D -> N is in 4th? Wait: M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> so N in 4th -> invalid? But we put N in 4th? So avoid.

We must have the N in 3rd position? In the pattern ""?ON??"", the N is in the third position? Yes: index 1: first letter, 2: second (O), 3: third (N), ... So if we have N in third position, that's allowed.

Example: let X be a letter that is not forbidden.

So pattern: _ O N _ _

Possible letters: X must be from {B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,P,Q,T,U,V,X,Z} and then the last two also from that set.

Word: ""honey"": H,O,N,E,Y -> E and Y are forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""ionic"": I,O,N,I,C -> C forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""money"": M,O,N,E,Y -> E and Y forbidden -> invalid.

Another one: ""boney"": B,O,E,N,Y -> E forbidden and Y forbidden -> invalid.

How about ""tonne"": T,O,N,N,E -> E forbidden -> invalid.

Or ""linen"": L,I,N,E,N -> E forbidden -> invalid.

How about ""phone"": P,H,O,N,E -> E forbidden -> invalid.

It seems difficult? Perhaps N in position 5.

N in position 5, O in somewhere.

Pattern: ""????N"" with O in one of the first four, but not position 3? Actually O can be in 1,2,4? Not 3? So O in 1,2, or 4.

For example, O in position 1: ""O???N""
  - ""ocean"": C, A -> forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""organ"": R, A -> forbidden.
  - ""ovens"": V,E,N,S -> E and S forbidden -> invalid.

O in position 2: ""?O??N""
  - ""doing"": D,O,I,N,G -> N is in 4th? Wait: D,O,I,N,G -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> but N is in 4th? So we want N to be in 5th? Then it must be the last letter.

In ""doing"", N is in 4th, which is forbidden? We need N in 5th? Now we are considering N in 5th.

Pattern: ? O ? ? N

So example: ""brown"": B,R,O,W,N -> R and W forbidden -> invalid.

""grown"": G,R,O,W,N -> R and W -> invalid.

""town"": not 5 letters.

""clown"": C,L,O,W,N -> C and W forbidden -> invalid.

""owner"": O,W,N,E,R -> W,E,R all forbidden -> invalid.

O in position 4: ""???O N"" -> ? ? ? O N

Example: ""felon"": F,E,L,O,N -> E forbidden -> invalid.

""melon"": M,E,L,O,N -> E -> invalid.

""demon"": D,E,M,O,N -> E -> invalid.

""notion"": N,O,T,I,O,N -> six? wait, 5 letters: ""notion"" is 6? Or 5? No, ""notion"" has 6 letters. We need 5.

""motion"": M,O,T,I,O,N -> also 6.

5-letter: ... How about ""llion""? No.

Perhaps I should consider words with N in position 5 and O in position 2? Without forbidden letters.

Another word: ""booth"": B,O,O,T,H -> no N? Must have N.

All words must have N.

Perhaps try N in position 3 and O in position 1: ""O?N??""
  - ""owned"": O,W,N,E,D -> W and E -> invalid.
  - ""oink"": too short.
  - ""oinks"": S -> invalid.

How about O in position 4: ""??N O ?"" (N in 3rd, O in 4th): ? ? N O ?

Words: ""pinto"": P,I,N,T,O -> O in 5th? Positions: P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), O(5) -> but O is in 5th? We were doing N in 3rd and O in 4th? But here O is in 5th.

For O in 4th: ""??N O ?"" -> first two unknown, then N, then O, then last unknown.

Example: ""union"": U,N,I,O,N -> U is not forbidden? Let's see: U(1),N(2),I(3),O(4),N(5) -> but N is in 2nd position? But we have N in 2nd forbidden? Also, the N in the word is in multiple positions.

But the word must have N in the word, and here it has two N's.

In ""union"", the letters are U, N, I, O, N.

Positions: 1:U, 2:N, 3:I -> but N in position 2 is forbidden? From ""snowy"" we know N is not in position 2. But in ""union"", position 2 is N, which would be wrong. So if we guess ""union"", the feedback will show that N in position 2 is not correct.

But we know N is present, so if we put it in position 2, it should give '-', but we already know it's not there? But the purpose of the guess is to test.

Actually, we can use a word that has N in position 2 if we want to, but we know it's not correct, so it's a waste of a letter? We should avoid positions we know are wrong.

So for N, avoid positions 2 and 4.

In ""union"", N is in position 2 and 5. Position 2 is bad, position 5 might be good? But we have two N's.

We know at least one N is present. If there is one N, then position 2 is wrong, and the other N is elsewhere? But we don't know.

But we know from previous that N is not in 2 or 4.

If the word has only one N, then it must be in 1,3, or 5.

If it has two N's, then one might be in 2 or 4, but the feedback from previous guesses said for position 4 of ""crane"": only that there is an N not in position 4, but if there is another N in position 4? Then for ""crane"", the N in position 4 would have been a 'check' if the word had an N in position 4? But we got '-' meaning the N is in the word but not in that position. So if the word had an N in position 4, the feedback would have been 'check' for that position? Therefore, the word does not have N in position 4 at all. Same for position 2: if we got '-' for ""snowy"" position 2 N, that means there's an N in the word but not in position 2. Therefore, position 2 does not have N in the secret word.

So the secret word has N in positions 1, 3, or 5, and definitely not in 2 or 4.

Therefore, in any guess, if we put N in position 2 or 4, we will get a '-'.

So, for efficiency, we should avoid positions 2 and 4 for N, because we know it's wrong.

Similarly for O, we know it's not in position 3, so we should avoid position 3 for O.

Back to our word search.

Let's try a word with N in position 1 and O in position 5: ""N???O""

Possible words: ""video"": V,I,D,E,O -> E forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""radio"": R,A,D,I,O -> R and A forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""nitro"": N,I,T,R,O -> R forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""disco"": D,I,S,C,O -> S and C forbidden -> invalid.

Not working.

N in position 1 and O in position 4: ""N??O?""
  - ""ノート"" not English.
  - ""notch"": N,O,T,C,H -> C forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""north"": N,O,R,T,H -> R forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""novel"": N,O,V,E,L -> E forbidden -> invalid.

N in position 3 and O in position 1: ""O?N??""
  - ""ontic"": O,N,T,I,C -> C forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""onion"": O,N,I,O,N -> positions: O(1), N(2), I(3), O(4), N(5)
    - But N is in position 2? That is not allowed! We will get N in position 2 as wrong, but we know it's wrong, and it uses a space.

""onth"": not a word.

N in position 3 and O in position 2: ""?ON??""
  - ""boned"": B,O,N,E,D -> E forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""bonds"": B,O,N,D,S -> S forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""bound"": B,O,U,N,D -> U and D might be okay, but is it valid? Bound is a word, but let's see letters: B,O,U,N,D. None forbidden? Forbidden letters are C, R, A, E, S, W, Y. So B, O, U, N, D are all okay.

And positions: B(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> wait, N is in position 4? That's forbidden!

In ""bound"", spelling: B-O-U-N-D -> positions: 1:B,2:O,3:U,4:N,5:D -> so N in 4th? Forbidden.

We must have N in 1,3, or 5? In this pattern, for ""?ON??"", the N is in position 3? How? Pattern: index 1: first letter, 2: O, 3: N, 4: fourth letter, 5: fifth letter.

So if I have a word like ""XONYZ"", then N is in position 3? Which is allowed? Because we need N in 1,3, or 5.

So N in position 3 is allowed.

Similarly, O is in position 2, which is not position 3, so allowed.

Let's find words in the form ""XONYZ"" where X,O,N are fixed? No, X can be any allowed letter, then O in 2, N in 3, and Y and Z any allowed letters.

And the word must be valid.

Examples with X from allowed letters, Y, Z from allowed letters.

Possible X: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,P,Q,T,U,V,X,Z

Y and Z same

Word: ""done"": too short.

""phone"": has E -> invalid.

""clone"": has C and E -> invalid.

""stone"": has S and E -> invalid.

""monk"": not 5 letters.

""tonne"": has E -> invalid.

""coned"": has C and E -> invalid.

""zoned"": has Z,O,N,E,D -> E forbidden -> invalid, and Z is allowed? Forbidden letters are C,R,A,E,S,W,Y, so Z is allowed? Yes, but ""zoned"" has E -> invalid.

""honed"": H,O,N,E,D -> E -> invalid.

Doned? Not a word.

 How about ""bound"" spelled with N at position 3? That would be B,O,U,N,D -> positions: B(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> so N is not in position 3.

 To have N in position 3: the third letter must be N.

So for ""XONYZ"", it is: position1: X, 2: O, 3: N? No, ""XON"" would be positions: first: X, second: O, third: the letter we put for third? But we want N in third? So the third letter must be N, so in a word, it should be like ""X"" then O then N ... no? The format is position2 O and position3 N, so the word should be X (pos1), O (pos2), N (pos3), Y (pos4), Z (pos5).

 So spelling: X O N Y Z

 For example: ""gong"": not 5 letters.

 ""long"": not 5.

 ""bong"": B,O,N,G -> too short.

 5-letter words: ""bonds"": B,O,N,D,S -> S forbidden -> invalid.
   - ""dons"": not 5.
   - ""font"": not 5.
   - ""lion"": not 5.

 How about ""donut"" but we want the form with position2=O and position3=N? ""donut"" is D O N U T -> positions: D(1), O(2), N(3), U(4), T(5) -> yes! This is the form.

 N is in position 3? Which is allowed, since position 3 is not 2 or 4.

 O is in position 2? Which is allowed, since it's not position 3.

 And the word ""donut"" uses D,O,N,U,T -> all allowed letters (not in forbidden list).

 D is allowed? Yes.
 O is in there.
 N is in position 3.
 U and T are allowed? Yes, not forbidden.

 Why didn't I think of ""donut"" earlier?

 let's confirm:
 Guess: ""donut""
 Positions: 1: D, 2: O, 3: N, 4: U, 5: T
 Constraints:
  - N is in position 3: allowed (because only positions 2 and 4 are bad for N, and 3 is not?).
  - O is in position 2: allowed for O (because only position 3 is bad for O, and 2 is not).

And no forbidden letters: A, C, E, R, S, W, Y are all avoided.

""DONUT"" is a valid English word? It might be considered informal, but word games accept variations, and it's commonly used.

 Let's go with ""donut"".

 This guess will help us by:
  - Testing D, U, T which are new.
  - And positions for the known letters N and O.

 It's not required to be uppercase, but we can write in lowercase.

 So, guess: ""donut""

<guess>donut</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the previous feedback:
- From ""crane"": C, R, A, E are absent; N is present but not in position 4.
- From ""snowy"": S, W, Y are absent; N is present but not in position 2; O is present but not in position 3.

Key deductions:
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, S, W, Y (must avoid).
- **Present letters**: N and O (must include).
- **Position constraints**: 
  - N cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (based on prior guesses), so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
  - O cannot be in position 3, so it must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z (prioritize common letters like D, T, U for testing).

Based on this,""donut"" is chosen as the third guess because:
1. It includes both ""N"" and ""O"" (required), placing:
   - ""N"" in position 3 (allowed, since not excluded and tested position).
   - ""O"" in position 2 (allowed, not excluded for O).
2. It avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, E, S, W, Y).
3. It tests new common letters: D (position 1), U (position 4), and T (position 5), maximizing information.
4. It respects positional constraints and is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess helps narrow down the position of ""N"" and ""O"" while testing three new letters.

<guess>donut</guess>",donut,"We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C, R, A, E: absent (x)
- N: present, but not in the 4th position (so in the word somewhere else)

Second guess: ""snowy""
- S, W, Y: absent (x)
- N: present but not in the 2nd position (where we placed it in ""snowy"")
- O: present but not in the 3rd position (where we placed it in ""snowy"")

So, combining the information:

Letters known to be absent: C, R, A, E, S, W, Y
Letters known to be present: N and O

We also know that:
- N is in the word, but not in position 4 (from ""crane"") and not in position 2 (from ""snowy"")
- O is in the word, but not in position 3 (from ""snowy"")

Now, we need to guess a word that:
- Contains N and O (since they are present)
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, E, S, W, Y
- Places N not in position 2 or 4
- Places O not in position 3

We must use only the remaining letters. English letters available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z (but we should prioritize common ones)

Also, we need to consider the positions for N and O.

Possible positions for N: 1, 3, or 5 (since 2 and 4 are excluded)
Possible positions for O: any except 3? Actually, position 3 is excluded for O, so positions 1,2,4,5 are possible for O? But we don't know if O can be in 2, etc.

But note: we don't have any constraints on other positions yet.

Now, we know the word has at least N and O, and we have to guess using the available letters.

Let's think of common 5-letter words with N and O, avoiding the bad letters.

Also, since from ""crane"" we had N present, and in ""snowy"" we also have N present, but with different positions, and same for O (only appeared in ""snowy"").

We can try to include other common letters to test: such as T, L, I, etc.

Possible words:

- ""point"": but has P, O, I, N, T -> but we must avoid A, C, R, E, S, W, Y. ""point""? It has P,O,I,N,T. None of the forbidden letters? But wait: C, R, A, E, S, W, Y are absent, so P, O, I, N, T are acceptable. Also, positions: in ""point"", N is in position 4? But we know from first guess that N cannot be in position 4! So if we put ""point"", and N is in 4th, then it cannot be correct because N is not in position 4? Therefore, we avoid words with N in position 4.

Similarly, in ""point"", O is in position 2? That might be okay because we don't have constraint against position 2 for O? But for O, we only know it's not in position 3. So position 2 is possible.

But N is in position 4 in ""point"", which is forbidden (because we know N is not in 4th). So we cannot use ""point"" because we know N is not in the 4th?

Wait, but if the word is ""point"", then in the first guess ""crane"" we had N in the 4th and got a '-' meaning N is in the word but not in that position. If ""point"" has N in the 4th, then for the first guess (if the word was ""point"") the feedback would have been for N: if N is in the 4th then it should be a check, but we got a '-' meaning it's not in the 4th? Contradiction? So the word cannot be ""point"" because we know N is not in position 4.

Therefore, we must avoid any word that has N in position 4 because we know that position is wrong.

Similarly, for position 2: we know from ""snowy"" that N is not in position 2? So we also avoid position 2 for N.

Therefore, N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Similarly, O must not be in position 3? So O must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We need a word that has both N and O with N in 1,3, or 5 and O in 1,2,4,5, but also avoiding forbidden letters.

And the word must not use any of the absent letters.

Now, let's list possibilities:

- Option 1: N in position 1, O in position 2: e.g., ""NO???"" 
  - But forbidden letters: avoid A, C, E, R, S, W, Y. So words like ""noble"" has A? Wait, ""noble"" has A? Actually, ""noble"" is N,O,B,L,E -> E is forbidden, invalid.
  - ""nodal"": has A and L? ""nodal"" is N,O,D,A,L -> A is forbidden? Wait, A is absent, so we cannot use A. So invalid.
  - ""noisy"": but S and Y are forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""nomad"": has A, invalid.
  - ""noble"": has E, invalid.
  - ""noted"": has E, invalid.
  - ""north"": has R? R is forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""novel"": has E? Invalid.

It's hard? How about N in 1 and O in 4: e.g., ""N??O?""
  - For example, ""nitro"": but R and T? R forbidden -> invalid.

Alternatively, N in 1 and O in 5: e.g., ""N???O""
  - Words like ""nacho"": has A, C -> invalid.
  - ""nacho"" has A and C -> both forbidden.
  - Or ""neato"": has A,E -> both forbidden.

Not working? How about N in position 3 and O in another position?

Let me try N in position 3: so ""??N??""

And O can be in 1,2,4,5.

For example, O in 1, N in 3: ""O?N??"" 
  - Words: ""owner"": has W and R? W forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""oink"": not 5 letters? Must be 5 letters.

""oinks"": has S -> invalid.

O in 2, N in 3: ""?ON??""
  - Words: ""bonus"": has B, O, N, U, S -> S is forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""tonic"": has T, O, N, I, C -> C is forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""donut"": has D, O, N, U, T -> no forbidden letters? Wait, letters: D, O, N, U, T. Avoided A,C,E,R,S,W,Y -> so allowed? But we don't know about U. But it's possible.

""donut"" is a word, and has O in 2nd, N in 3rd? But we also have U and T.

Is that okay? Yes.

Another word: ""going"": has G,O,I,N,G -> but N in 4th? Avoid N in 4th? We need N in position 3? In ""going"": positions: G(1),O(2),I(3),N(4),G(4? wait: going is G,O,I,N,G -> so positions:1:G,2:O,3:I,4:N,5:G -> so N is in 4th, which is forbidden? Yes. So we avoid.

N in position 3: so third letter must be N.

So for ""?ON??"": example ""bonus"" has S -> invalid.
  - ""font"": not 5 letters.
  - ""front"": has R -> invalid.
  - ""mound"": has M,O,U,N,D -> N is in 4th? Wait: M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> so N in 4th -> invalid? But we put N in 4th? So avoid.

We must have the N in 3rd position? In the pattern ""?ON??"", the N is in the third position? Yes: index 1: first letter, 2: second (O), 3: third (N), ... So if we have N in third position, that's allowed.

Example: let X be a letter that is not forbidden.

So pattern: _ O N _ _

Possible letters: X must be from {B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,P,Q,T,U,V,X,Z} and then the last two also from that set.

Word: ""honey"": H,O,N,E,Y -> E and Y are forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""ionic"": I,O,N,I,C -> C forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""money"": M,O,N,E,Y -> E and Y forbidden -> invalid.

Another one: ""boney"": B,O,E,N,Y -> E forbidden and Y forbidden -> invalid.

How about ""tonne"": T,O,N,N,E -> E forbidden -> invalid.

Or ""linen"": L,I,N,E,N -> E forbidden -> invalid.

How about ""phone"": P,H,O,N,E -> E forbidden -> invalid.

It seems difficult? Perhaps N in position 5.

N in position 5, O in somewhere.

Pattern: ""????N"" with O in one of the first four, but not position 3? Actually O can be in 1,2,4? Not 3? So O in 1,2, or 4.

For example, O in position 1: ""O???N""
  - ""ocean"": C, A -> forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""organ"": R, A -> forbidden.
  - ""ovens"": V,E,N,S -> E and S forbidden -> invalid.

O in position 2: ""?O??N""
  - ""doing"": D,O,I,N,G -> N is in 4th? Wait: D,O,I,N,G -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> but N is in 4th? So we want N to be in 5th? Then it must be the last letter.

In ""doing"", N is in 4th, which is forbidden? We need N in 5th? Now we are considering N in 5th.

Pattern: ? O ? ? N

So example: ""brown"": B,R,O,W,N -> R and W forbidden -> invalid.

""grown"": G,R,O,W,N -> R and W -> invalid.

""town"": not 5 letters.

""clown"": C,L,O,W,N -> C and W forbidden -> invalid.

""owner"": O,W,N,E,R -> W,E,R all forbidden -> invalid.

O in position 4: ""???O N"" -> ? ? ? O N

Example: ""felon"": F,E,L,O,N -> E forbidden -> invalid.

""melon"": M,E,L,O,N -> E -> invalid.

""demon"": D,E,M,O,N -> E -> invalid.

""notion"": N,O,T,I,O,N -> six? wait, 5 letters: ""notion"" is 6? Or 5? No, ""notion"" has 6 letters. We need 5.

""motion"": M,O,T,I,O,N -> also 6.

5-letter: ... How about ""llion""? No.

Perhaps I should consider words with N in position 5 and O in position 2? Without forbidden letters.

Another word: ""booth"": B,O,O,T,H -> no N? Must have N.

All words must have N.

Perhaps try N in position 3 and O in position 1: ""O?N??""
  - ""owned"": O,W,N,E,D -> W and E -> invalid.
  - ""oink"": too short.
  - ""oinks"": S -> invalid.

How about O in position 4: ""??N O ?"" (N in 3rd, O in 4th): ? ? N O ?

Words: ""pinto"": P,I,N,T,O -> O in 5th? Positions: P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), O(5) -> but O is in 5th? We were doing N in 3rd and O in 4th? But here O is in 5th.

For O in 4th: ""??N O ?"" -> first two unknown, then N, then O, then last unknown.

Example: ""union"": U,N,I,O,N -> U is not forbidden? Let's see: U(1),N(2),I(3),O(4),N(5) -> but N is in 2nd position? But we have N in 2nd forbidden? Also, the N in the word is in multiple positions.

But the word must have N in the word, and here it has two N's.

In ""union"", the letters are U, N, I, O, N.

Positions: 1:U, 2:N, 3:I -> but N in position 2 is forbidden? From ""snowy"" we know N is not in position 2. But in ""union"", position 2 is N, which would be wrong. So if we guess ""union"", the feedback will show that N in position 2 is not correct.

But we know N is present, so if we put it in position 2, it should give '-', but we already know it's not there? But the purpose of the guess is to test.

Actually, we can use a word that has N in position 2 if we want to, but we know it's not correct, so it's a waste of a letter? We should avoid positions we know are wrong.

So for N, avoid positions 2 and 4.

In ""union"", N is in position 2 and 5. Position 2 is bad, position 5 might be good? But we have two N's.

We know at least one N is present. If there is one N, then position 2 is wrong, and the other N is elsewhere? But we don't know.

But we know from previous that N is not in 2 or 4.

If the word has only one N, then it must be in 1,3, or 5.

If it has two N's, then one might be in 2 or 4, but the feedback from previous guesses said for position 4 of ""crane"": only that there is an N not in position 4, but if there is another N in position 4? Then for ""crane"", the N in position 4 would have been a 'check' if the word had an N in position 4? But we got '-' meaning the N is in the word but not in that position. So if the word had an N in position 4, the feedback would have been 'check' for that position? Therefore, the word does not have N in position 4 at all. Same for position 2: if we got '-' for ""snowy"" position 2 N, that means there's an N in the word but not in position 2. Therefore, position 2 does not have N in the secret word.

So the secret word has N in positions 1, 3, or 5, and definitely not in 2 or 4.

Therefore, in any guess, if we put N in position 2 or 4, we will get a '-'.

So, for efficiency, we should avoid positions 2 and 4 for N, because we know it's wrong.

Similarly for O, we know it's not in position 3, so we should avoid position 3 for O.

Back to our word search.

Let's try a word with N in position 1 and O in position 5: ""N???O""

Possible words: ""video"": V,I,D,E,O -> E forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""radio"": R,A,D,I,O -> R and A forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""nitro"": N,I,T,R,O -> R forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""disco"": D,I,S,C,O -> S and C forbidden -> invalid.

Not working.

N in position 1 and O in position 4: ""N??O?""
  - ""ノート"" not English.
  - ""notch"": N,O,T,C,H -> C forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""north"": N,O,R,T,H -> R forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""novel"": N,O,V,E,L -> E forbidden -> invalid.

N in position 3 and O in position 1: ""O?N??""
  - ""ontic"": O,N,T,I,C -> C forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""onion"": O,N,I,O,N -> positions: O(1), N(2), I(3), O(4), N(5)
    - But N is in position 2? That is not allowed! We will get N in position 2 as wrong, but we know it's wrong, and it uses a space.

""onth"": not a word.

N in position 3 and O in position 2: ""?ON??""
  - ""boned"": B,O,N,E,D -> E forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""bonds"": B,O,N,D,S -> S forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""bound"": B,O,U,N,D -> U and D might be okay, but is it valid? Bound is a word, but let's see letters: B,O,U,N,D. None forbidden? Forbidden letters are C, R, A, E, S, W, Y. So B, O, U, N, D are all okay.

And positions: B(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> wait, N is in position 4? That's forbidden!

In ""bound"", spelling: B-O-U-N-D -> positions: 1:B,2:O,3:U,4:N,5:D -> so N in 4th? Forbidden.

We must have N in 1,3, or 5? In this pattern, for ""?ON??"", the N is in position 3? How? Pattern: index 1: first letter, 2: O, 3: N, 4: fourth letter, 5: fifth letter.

So if I have a word like ""XONYZ"", then N is in position 3? Which is allowed? Because we need N in 1,3, or 5.

So N in position 3 is allowed.

Similarly, O is in position 2, which is not position 3, so allowed.

Let's find words in the form ""XONYZ"" where X,O,N are fixed? No, X can be any allowed letter, then O in 2, N in 3, and Y and Z any allowed letters.

And the word must be valid.

Examples with X from allowed letters, Y, Z from allowed letters.

Possible X: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,P,Q,T,U,V,X,Z

Y and Z same

Word: ""done"": too short.

""phone"": has E -> invalid.

""clone"": has C and E -> invalid.

""stone"": has S and E -> invalid.

""monk"": not 5 letters.

""tonne"": has E -> invalid.

""coned"": has C and E -> invalid.

""zoned"": has Z,O,N,E,D -> E forbidden -> invalid, and Z is allowed? Forbidden letters are C,R,A,E,S,W,Y, so Z is allowed? Yes, but ""zoned"" has E -> invalid.

""honed"": H,O,N,E,D -> E -> invalid.

Doned? Not a word.

 How about ""bound"" spelled with N at position 3? That would be B,O,U,N,D -> positions: B(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> so N is not in position 3.

 To have N in position 3: the third letter must be N.

So for ""XONYZ"", it is: position1: X, 2: O, 3: N? No, ""XON"" would be positions: first: X, second: O, third: the letter we put for third? But we want N in third? So the third letter must be N, so in a word, it should be like ""X"" then O then N ... no? The format is position2 O and position3 N, so the word should be X (pos1), O (pos2), N (pos3), Y (pos4), Z (pos5).

 So spelling: X O N Y Z

 For example: ""gong"": not 5 letters.

 ""long"": not 5.

 ""bong"": B,O,N,G -> too short.

 5-letter words: ""bonds"": B,O,N,D,S -> S forbidden -> invalid.
   - ""dons"": not 5.
   - ""font"": not 5.
   - ""lion"": not 5.

 How about ""donut"" but we want the form with position2=O and position3=N? ""donut"" is D O N U T -> positions: D(1), O(2), N(3), U(4), T(5) -> yes! This is the form.

 N is in position 3? Which is allowed, since position 3 is not 2 or 4.

 O is in position 2? Which is allowed, since it's not position 3.

 And the word ""donut"" uses D,O,N,U,T -> all allowed letters (not in forbidden list).

 D is allowed? Yes.
 O is in there.
 N is in position 3.
 U and T are allowed? Yes, not forbidden.

 Why didn't I think of ""donut"" earlier?

 let's confirm:
 Guess: ""donut""
 Positions: 1: D, 2: O, 3: N, 4: U, 5: T
 Constraints:
  - N is in position 3: allowed (because only positions 2 and 4 are bad for N, and 3 is not?).
  - O is in position 2: allowed for O (because only position 3 is bad for O, and 2 is not).

And no forbidden letters: A, C, E, R, S, W, Y are all avoided.

""DONUT"" is a valid English word? It might be considered informal, but word games accept variations, and it's commonly used.

 Let's go with ""donut"".

 This guess will help us by:
  - Testing D, U, T which are new.
  - And positions for the known letters N and O.

 It's not required to be uppercase, but we can write in lowercase.

 So, guess: ""donut""

<guess>donut</guess>After analyzing the previous feedback:
- From ""crane"": C, R, A, E are absent; N is present but not in position 4.
- From ""snowy"": S, W, Y are absent; N is present but not in position 2; O is present but not in position 3.

Key deductions:
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, S, W, Y (must avoid).
- **Present letters**: N and O (must include).
- **Position constraints**: 
  - N cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (based on prior guesses), so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
  - O cannot be in position 3, so it must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z (prioritize common letters like D, T, U for testing).

Based on this,""donut"" is chosen as the third guess because:
1. It includes both ""N"" and ""O"" (required), placing:
   - ""N"" in position 3 (allowed, since not excluded and tested position).
   - ""O"" in position 2 (allowed, not excluded for O).
2. It avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, E, S, W, Y).
3. It tests new common letters: D (position 1), U (position 4), and T (position 5), maximizing information.
4. It respects positional constraints and is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess helps narrow down the position of ""N"" and ""O"" while testing three new letters.",Guess 3: donut -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(✓) N(-) U(x) T(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,toxin,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to make an initial guess.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter 'N' is in the secret word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""crane"" it was at the 4th and got a '-' meaning present but wrong spot).
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'N' and does not contain C, R, A, E.

 We have to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
 1. Includes 'N' (since we know it's in the word) but not in the 4th position (because in the first guess it was in the 4th and was wrong position).
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, E.
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Let's think of common letters that are not C, R, A, E. Some common letters in English 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

 We also know that 'N' must be in the word. So we can try to put 'N' in a different position.

 Possible positions for 'N': since it was in the 4th position in ""crane"" and that was wrong, we can try positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 However, note that the feedback does not tell us how many times a letter appears. So the word might have one 'N' or more? But we only know one is present.

 We should also try to include other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Let's try to form a word that has:
 - 'N' in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4)
 - and uses letters from: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""saint"" but note that 'A' is not allowed (we know A is not in the word) -> so avoid A.
 - ""point"": P, O, I, N, T -> but note we haven't tried P, O, I, T. However, we must avoid A, C, R, E (which we are). Also, we can put 'N' in the 4th position? But wait, in the first guess we had 'N' in the 4th and it was wrong. So if we put 'N' in the 4th again, it would be the same position and we know it's wrong. So we should avoid the 4th position for 'N'. Therefore, we cannot use ""point"" because it has 'N' in the 4th.

 We need a word with 'N' not in the 4th.

 Let's think of words with 'N' in the 1st: ""night"", ""nasty"" (but avoid A), ""noble"", ""noisy"" (but avoid A? no, A is not in the word so we can use other vowels? Actually, we know A is not in the word, but we can use O, I, U, etc.)

 But note: we also know that the word does not have A, so we must avoid A.

 Let's try ""noisy"": N, O, I, S, Y -> but has O, I, S, Y. However, we don't know about these. But wait, ""noisy"" has an 'S' and 'Y'. Also, we can check if it's valid.

 Alternatively, we can try ""snowy"": S, N, O, W, Y -> but then 'N' is in the 2nd position. That's acceptable.

 However, we must avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, E. ""snowy"" doesn't have any of these.

 Another option: ""linen"" -> but note we have two N's? And we don't know if the word has two N's. Also, we have an 'E' which we know is absent? So we cannot use 'E'. So ""linen"" is invalid because of E.

 We must avoid E as well.

 So, let's list some words without A, C, R, E and with one 'N' (or possibly two, but we don't know) and with 'N' not in the 4th.

 Words:
 - ""nymph"": N, Y, M, P, H -> but that's a valid word? Yes. And 'N' is in the 1st position.
 - ""dingy"": D, I, N, G, Y -> 'N' in the 3rd position. Avoids A, C, R, E.

 But we don't know if the word has D, I, G, Y, etc.

 Another idea: we want to test as many new common letters as possible. Common letters: S, T, L, O, P, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that has 'N' and also includes S, T, L, O, etc.

 Example: ""tonal"" -> but has A (which is absent) -> invalid.
 Example: ""stony"": S, T, O, N, Y -> 'N' in the 4th? We must avoid 4th for N? But wait, we know that in the first guess the 4th position was wrong for N, but if the word has two N's? Then it might be that the 4th position is also N and we get a match? But we don't know. However, the feedback only tells us that there is at least one N and it's not in the 4th. So if we put N in the 4th again, it might be that the word has only one N and then we get a '-' again (if the N is in a different position) or if the word has two N's and one of them is in the 4th, then we might get a check. But we don't know.

 However, to avoid confusion, it's better to try a word that has 'N' in a new position to get more information about the position of N.

 So, let's avoid the 4th position for now.

 Therefore, ""stony"" is not ideal because it has N in the 4th.

 How about ""stint"": S, T, I, N, T -> but has two T's? And N in the 4th? Again, same issue.

 How about ""mount"": M, O, U, N, T -> N in the 4th? Same.

 How about ""doing"": D, O, I, N, G -> N in the 4th? Same.

 We need to avoid the 4th for N? But we can try it if we have to, but let's try to find a word without N in the 4th.

 How about ""ninth"": N, I, N, T, H -> has two N's? And the first N is in the 1st, and the third letter is N. But we don't know if the word has two N's. Also, we are avoiding A, C, R, E. This word is valid.

 But note: we have two N's. We know at least one N is present. If the word has two N's, then we might get feedback for both. However, we are not sure.

 Alternatively, we can try ""sling"": S, L, I, N, G -> N in the 4th? Again.

 It's hard to avoid the 4th? Maybe we should not avoid the 4th? Because the feedback for the first guess only said that the N in the 4th was wrong, but if the word has two N's, then the 4th might be correct? Actually, no: the feedback for the first guess: the N was in the 4th and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that the secret word has an N, but not in the 4th position. Therefore, if we put N in the 4th again, it will definitely be wrong (because the secret word doesn't have an N in the 4th). So we should avoid the 4th position for N.

 Therefore, we must choose a word that has N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 Let me try to think of words with N in the 5th? That's less common. Example: ""grown"", ""flown"", ""brown"", but we don't know if these letters are allowed.

 But we can use: ""grown"": G, R, O, W, N -> but wait, R is in the word? We know from the first guess that R is not in the word (because we had R in ""crane"" and it was marked x). So we cannot use R.

 Similarly, we cannot use R.

 So, avoid R.

 How about ""brown"": B, R, O, W, N -> has R -> invalid.

 How about ""flown"": F, L, O, W, N -> has L, O, W, N. And no R? But wait, we don't have R? Actually, we know R is absent. So ""flown"" has R? No, ""flown"" is F, L, O, W, N -> no R. But we also must avoid A, C, E. This word is okay.

 However, we have N in the 5th. That's a new position.

 But we don't know about F, L, O, W.

 Alternatively, we can try ""known"": K, N, O, W, N -> has two N's? And N in the 1st and 5th? But we are allowed to have two N's? And we know the word has at least one N. This word is valid.

 But let me choose a word that has more common letters. We haven't tested S, T, L, O, etc.

 How about ""snowy"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N in the 2nd position. This is acceptable.

 We can use ""snowy"". It avoids A, C, R, E. It has S, N, O, W, Y.

 Another option: ""nobly"": N, O, B, L, Y -> N in the 1st. This is also good.

 Let me choose between these.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible. Common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, N, O (but we already know N is in, and we are using O). Also, we haven't tested T? So maybe we should include T.

 How about ""notch"": but has C and H? We know C is absent, so invalid.

 How about ""tonic"": has C and T, O, N, I -> but C is absent -> invalid.

 How about ""joint"": J, O, I, N, T -> N in the 4th? We must avoid 4th for N -> so no.

 How about ""point"": again, N in the 4th -> avoid.

 How about ""night"": N, I, G, H, T -> N in the 1st. This is good. And we avoid A, C, R, E. It has I, G, H, T.

 But we don't know about these letters.

 Alternatively, ""sight"": S, I, G, H, T -> but no N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we cannot use ""sight"".

 So, we must include N.

 Therefore, ""night"" is a candidate.

 Another candidate: ""thing"": T, H, I, N, G -> N in the 4th? Avoid.

 How about ""tinge"": but has E -> invalid.

 How about ""sting"": S, T, I, N, G -> N in the 4th? Avoid.

 How about ""singe"": has E -> invalid.

 How about ""minim"": M, I, N, I, M -> has two M's and two I's? And N in the 3rd. This is acceptable? But it's a rare word.

 We want a common word.

 Let me go with ""night"" or ""snowy"". 

 I think ""snowy"" is a good choice because it has common letters and N in the 2nd (a new position). Also, it uses S, O, W, Y which we haven't tried.

 Alternatively, we can try ""downy"": D, O, W, N, Y -> N in the 4th? Avoid.

 How about ""windy"": W, I, N, D, Y -> N in the 3rd. This is acceptable.

 But ""windy"" has D and Y. We haven't tried D and Y.

 However, I think ""snowy"" is a better choice because it has S which is a very common letter.

 So, I'll go with ""snowy"".

 But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""snowy"" is a valid English word.

 Therefore, second guess: ""snowy""

 We'll get feedback on S, N, O, W, Y.

 Let's write it in the required format.After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- N is present but not in the 4th position (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- Must include ""N"" (since it's confirmed present) but avoid placing it in the 4th position.
- Must exclude C, R, A, and E (confirmed absent).
- Should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, L, Y) to maximize information.
- Avoid repeating the 4th-position placement for ""N"" to test new positions.

The word ""snowy"" fits these criteria:
- Contains ""N"" in the 2nd position (new slot).
- Uses new common letters: S, O, W, Y.
- Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess will help identify the position of ""N"" and test four additional letters.

<guess>snowy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: snowy -> FEEDBACK: S(x) N(-) O(-) W(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C, R, A, E: absent (x)
- N: present, but not in the 4th position (so in the word somewhere else)

Second guess: ""snowy""
- S, W, Y: absent (x)
- N: present but not in the 2nd position (where we placed it in ""snowy"")
- O: present but not in the 3rd position (where we placed it in ""snowy"")

So, combining the information:

Letters known to be absent: C, R, A, E, S, W, Y
Letters known to be present: N and O

We also know that:
- N is in the word, but not in position 4 (from ""crane"") and not in position 2 (from ""snowy"")
- O is in the word, but not in position 3 (from ""snowy"")

Now, we need to guess a word that:
- Contains N and O (since they are present)
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, E, S, W, Y
- Places N not in position 2 or 4
- Places O not in position 3

We must use only the remaining letters. English letters available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z (but we should prioritize common ones)

Also, we need to consider the positions for N and O.

Possible positions for N: 1, 3, or 5 (since 2 and 4 are excluded)
Possible positions for O: any except 3? Actually, position 3 is excluded for O, so positions 1,2,4,5 are possible for O? But we don't know if O can be in 2, etc.

But note: we don't have any constraints on other positions yet.

Now, we know the word has at least N and O, and we have to guess using the available letters.

Let's think of common 5-letter words with N and O, avoiding the bad letters.

Also, since from ""crane"" we had N present, and in ""snowy"" we also have N present, but with different positions, and same for O (only appeared in ""snowy"").

We can try to include other common letters to test: such as T, L, I, etc.

Possible words:

- ""point"": but has P, O, I, N, T -> but we must avoid A, C, R, E, S, W, Y. ""point""? It has P,O,I,N,T. None of the forbidden letters? But wait: C, R, A, E, S, W, Y are absent, so P, O, I, N, T are acceptable. Also, positions: in ""point"", N is in position 4? But we know from first guess that N cannot be in position 4! So if we put ""point"", and N is in 4th, then it cannot be correct because N is not in position 4? Therefore, we avoid words with N in position 4.

Similarly, in ""point"", O is in position 2? That might be okay because we don't have constraint against position 2 for O? But for O, we only know it's not in position 3. So position 2 is possible.

But N is in position 4 in ""point"", which is forbidden (because we know N is not in 4th). So we cannot use ""point"" because we know N is not in the 4th?

Wait, but if the word is ""point"", then in the first guess ""crane"" we had N in the 4th and got a '-' meaning N is in the word but not in that position. If ""point"" has N in the 4th, then for the first guess (if the word was ""point"") the feedback would have been for N: if N is in the 4th then it should be a check, but we got a '-' meaning it's not in the 4th? Contradiction? So the word cannot be ""point"" because we know N is not in position 4.

Therefore, we must avoid any word that has N in position 4 because we know that position is wrong.

Similarly, for position 2: we know from ""snowy"" that N is not in position 2? So we also avoid position 2 for N.

Therefore, N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Similarly, O must not be in position 3? So O must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We need a word that has both N and O with N in 1,3, or 5 and O in 1,2,4,5, but also avoiding forbidden letters.

And the word must not use any of the absent letters.

Now, let's list possibilities:

- Option 1: N in position 1, O in position 2: e.g., ""NO???"" 
  - But forbidden letters: avoid A, C, E, R, S, W, Y. So words like ""noble"" has A? Wait, ""noble"" has A? Actually, ""noble"" is N,O,B,L,E -> E is forbidden, invalid.
  - ""nodal"": has A and L? ""nodal"" is N,O,D,A,L -> A is forbidden? Wait, A is absent, so we cannot use A. So invalid.
  - ""noisy"": but S and Y are forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""nomad"": has A, invalid.
  - ""noble"": has E, invalid.
  - ""noted"": has E, invalid.
  - ""north"": has R? R is forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""novel"": has E? Invalid.

It's hard? How about N in 1 and O in 4: e.g., ""N??O?""
  - For example, ""nitro"": but R and T? R forbidden -> invalid.

Alternatively, N in 1 and O in 5: e.g., ""N???O""
  - Words like ""nacho"": has A, C -> invalid.
  - ""nacho"" has A and C -> both forbidden.
  - Or ""neato"": has A,E -> both forbidden.

Not working? How about N in position 3 and O in another position?

Let me try N in position 3: so ""??N??""

And O can be in 1,2,4,5.

For example, O in 1, N in 3: ""O?N??"" 
  - Words: ""owner"": has W and R? W forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""oink"": not 5 letters? Must be 5 letters.

""oinks"": has S -> invalid.

O in 2, N in 3: ""?ON??""
  - Words: ""bonus"": has B, O, N, U, S -> S is forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""tonic"": has T, O, N, I, C -> C is forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""donut"": has D, O, N, U, T -> no forbidden letters? Wait, letters: D, O, N, U, T. Avoided A,C,E,R,S,W,Y -> so allowed? But we don't know about U. But it's possible.

""donut"" is a word, and has O in 2nd, N in 3rd? But we also have U and T.

Is that okay? Yes.

Another word: ""going"": has G,O,I,N,G -> but N in 4th? Avoid N in 4th? We need N in position 3? In ""going"": positions: G(1),O(2),I(3),N(4),G(4? wait: going is G,O,I,N,G -> so positions:1:G,2:O,3:I,4:N,5:G -> so N is in 4th, which is forbidden? Yes. So we avoid.

N in position 3: so third letter must be N.

So for ""?ON??"": example ""bonus"" has S -> invalid.
  - ""font"": not 5 letters.
  - ""front"": has R -> invalid.
  - ""mound"": has M,O,U,N,D -> N is in 4th? Wait: M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> so N in 4th -> invalid? But we put N in 4th? So avoid.

We must have the N in 3rd position? In the pattern ""?ON??"", the N is in the third position? Yes: index 1: first letter, 2: second (O), 3: third (N), ... So if we have N in third position, that's allowed.

Example: let X be a letter that is not forbidden.

So pattern: _ O N _ _

Possible letters: X must be from {B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,P,Q,T,U,V,X,Z} and then the last two also from that set.

Word: ""honey"": H,O,N,E,Y -> E and Y are forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""ionic"": I,O,N,I,C -> C forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""money"": M,O,N,E,Y -> E and Y forbidden -> invalid.

Another one: ""boney"": B,O,E,N,Y -> E forbidden and Y forbidden -> invalid.

How about ""tonne"": T,O,N,N,E -> E forbidden -> invalid.

Or ""linen"": L,I,N,E,N -> E forbidden -> invalid.

How about ""phone"": P,H,O,N,E -> E forbidden -> invalid.

It seems difficult? Perhaps N in position 5.

N in position 5, O in somewhere.

Pattern: ""????N"" with O in one of the first four, but not position 3? Actually O can be in 1,2,4? Not 3? So O in 1,2, or 4.

For example, O in position 1: ""O???N""
  - ""ocean"": C, A -> forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""organ"": R, A -> forbidden.
  - ""ovens"": V,E,N,S -> E and S forbidden -> invalid.

O in position 2: ""?O??N""
  - ""doing"": D,O,I,N,G -> N is in 4th? Wait: D,O,I,N,G -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> but N is in 4th? So we want N to be in 5th? Then it must be the last letter.

In ""doing"", N is in 4th, which is forbidden? We need N in 5th? Now we are considering N in 5th.

Pattern: ? O ? ? N

So example: ""brown"": B,R,O,W,N -> R and W forbidden -> invalid.

""grown"": G,R,O,W,N -> R and W -> invalid.

""town"": not 5 letters.

""clown"": C,L,O,W,N -> C and W forbidden -> invalid.

""owner"": O,W,N,E,R -> W,E,R all forbidden -> invalid.

O in position 4: ""???O N"" -> ? ? ? O N

Example: ""felon"": F,E,L,O,N -> E forbidden -> invalid.

""melon"": M,E,L,O,N -> E -> invalid.

""demon"": D,E,M,O,N -> E -> invalid.

""notion"": N,O,T,I,O,N -> six? wait, 5 letters: ""notion"" is 6? Or 5? No, ""notion"" has 6 letters. We need 5.

""motion"": M,O,T,I,O,N -> also 6.

5-letter: ... How about ""llion""? No.

Perhaps I should consider words with N in position 5 and O in position 2? Without forbidden letters.

Another word: ""booth"": B,O,O,T,H -> no N? Must have N.

All words must have N.

Perhaps try N in position 3 and O in position 1: ""O?N??""
  - ""owned"": O,W,N,E,D -> W and E -> invalid.
  - ""oink"": too short.
  - ""oinks"": S -> invalid.

How about O in position 4: ""??N O ?"" (N in 3rd, O in 4th): ? ? N O ?

Words: ""pinto"": P,I,N,T,O -> O in 5th? Positions: P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), O(5) -> but O is in 5th? We were doing N in 3rd and O in 4th? But here O is in 5th.

For O in 4th: ""??N O ?"" -> first two unknown, then N, then O, then last unknown.

Example: ""union"": U,N,I,O,N -> U is not forbidden? Let's see: U(1),N(2),I(3),O(4),N(5) -> but N is in 2nd position? But we have N in 2nd forbidden? Also, the N in the word is in multiple positions.

But the word must have N in the word, and here it has two N's.

In ""union"", the letters are U, N, I, O, N.

Positions: 1:U, 2:N, 3:I -> but N in position 2 is forbidden? From ""snowy"" we know N is not in position 2. But in ""union"", position 2 is N, which would be wrong. So if we guess ""union"", the feedback will show that N in position 2 is not correct.

But we know N is present, so if we put it in position 2, it should give '-', but we already know it's not there? But the purpose of the guess is to test.

Actually, we can use a word that has N in position 2 if we want to, but we know it's not correct, so it's a waste of a letter? We should avoid positions we know are wrong.

So for N, avoid positions 2 and 4.

In ""union"", N is in position 2 and 5. Position 2 is bad, position 5 might be good? But we have two N's.

We know at least one N is present. If there is one N, then position 2 is wrong, and the other N is elsewhere? But we don't know.

But we know from previous that N is not in 2 or 4.

If the word has only one N, then it must be in 1,3, or 5.

If it has two N's, then one might be in 2 or 4, but the feedback from previous guesses said for position 4 of ""crane"": only that there is an N not in position 4, but if there is another N in position 4? Then for ""crane"", the N in position 4 would have been a 'check' if the word had an N in position 4? But we got '-' meaning the N is in the word but not in that position. So if the word had an N in position 4, the feedback would have been 'check' for that position? Therefore, the word does not have N in position 4 at all. Same for position 2: if we got '-' for ""snowy"" position 2 N, that means there's an N in the word but not in position 2. Therefore, position 2 does not have N in the secret word.

So the secret word has N in positions 1, 3, or 5, and definitely not in 2 or 4.

Therefore, in any guess, if we put N in position 2 or 4, we will get a '-'.

So, for efficiency, we should avoid positions 2 and 4 for N, because we know it's wrong.

Similarly for O, we know it's not in position 3, so we should avoid position 3 for O.

Back to our word search.

Let's try a word with N in position 1 and O in position 5: ""N???O""

Possible words: ""video"": V,I,D,E,O -> E forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""radio"": R,A,D,I,O -> R and A forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""nitro"": N,I,T,R,O -> R forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""disco"": D,I,S,C,O -> S and C forbidden -> invalid.

Not working.

N in position 1 and O in position 4: ""N??O?""
  - ""ノート"" not English.
  - ""notch"": N,O,T,C,H -> C forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""north"": N,O,R,T,H -> R forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""novel"": N,O,V,E,L -> E forbidden -> invalid.

N in position 3 and O in position 1: ""O?N??""
  - ""ontic"": O,N,T,I,C -> C forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""onion"": O,N,I,O,N -> positions: O(1), N(2), I(3), O(4), N(5)
    - But N is in position 2? That is not allowed! We will get N in position 2 as wrong, but we know it's wrong, and it uses a space.

""onth"": not a word.

N in position 3 and O in position 2: ""?ON??""
  - ""boned"": B,O,N,E,D -> E forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""bonds"": B,O,N,D,S -> S forbidden -> invalid.
  - ""bound"": B,O,U,N,D -> U and D might be okay, but is it valid? Bound is a word, but let's see letters: B,O,U,N,D. None forbidden? Forbidden letters are C, R, A, E, S, W, Y. So B, O, U, N, D are all okay.

And positions: B(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> wait, N is in position 4? That's forbidden!

In ""bound"", spelling: B-O-U-N-D -> positions: 1:B,2:O,3:U,4:N,5:D -> so N in 4th? Forbidden.

We must have N in 1,3, or 5? In this pattern, for ""?ON??"", the N is in position 3? How? Pattern: index 1: first letter, 2: O, 3: N, 4: fourth letter, 5: fifth letter.

So if I have a word like ""XONYZ"", then N is in position 3? Which is allowed? Because we need N in 1,3, or 5.

So N in position 3 is allowed.

Similarly, O is in position 2, which is not position 3, so allowed.

Let's find words in the form ""XONYZ"" where X,O,N are fixed? No, X can be any allowed letter, then O in 2, N in 3, and Y and Z any allowed letters.

And the word must be valid.

Examples with X from allowed letters, Y, Z from allowed letters.

Possible X: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,P,Q,T,U,V,X,Z

Y and Z same

Word: ""done"": too short.

""phone"": has E -> invalid.

""clone"": has C and E -> invalid.

""stone"": has S and E -> invalid.

""monk"": not 5 letters.

""tonne"": has E -> invalid.

""coned"": has C and E -> invalid.

""zoned"": has Z,O,N,E,D -> E forbidden -> invalid, and Z is allowed? Forbidden letters are C,R,A,E,S,W,Y, so Z is allowed? Yes, but ""zoned"" has E -> invalid.

""honed"": H,O,N,E,D -> E -> invalid.

Doned? Not a word.

 How about ""bound"" spelled with N at position 3? That would be B,O,U,N,D -> positions: B(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> so N is not in position 3.

 To have N in position 3: the third letter must be N.

So for ""XONYZ"", it is: position1: X, 2: O, 3: N? No, ""XON"" would be positions: first: X, second: O, third: the letter we put for third? But we want N in third? So the third letter must be N, so in a word, it should be like ""X"" then O then N ... no? The format is position2 O and position3 N, so the word should be X (pos1), O (pos2), N (pos3), Y (pos4), Z (pos5).

 So spelling: X O N Y Z

 For example: ""gong"": not 5 letters.

 ""long"": not 5.

 ""bong"": B,O,N,G -> too short.

 5-letter words: ""bonds"": B,O,N,D,S -> S forbidden -> invalid.
   - ""dons"": not 5.
   - ""font"": not 5.
   - ""lion"": not 5.

 How about ""donut"" but we want the form with position2=O and position3=N? ""donut"" is D O N U T -> positions: D(1), O(2), N(3), U(4), T(5) -> yes! This is the form.

 N is in position 3? Which is allowed, since position 3 is not 2 or 4.

 O is in position 2? Which is allowed, since it's not position 3.

 And the word ""donut"" uses D,O,N,U,T -> all allowed letters (not in forbidden list).

 D is allowed? Yes.
 O is in there.
 N is in position 3.
 U and T are allowed? Yes, not forbidden.

 Why didn't I think of ""donut"" earlier?

 let's confirm:
 Guess: ""donut""
 Positions: 1: D, 2: O, 3: N, 4: U, 5: T
 Constraints:
  - N is in position 3: allowed (because only positions 2 and 4 are bad for N, and 3 is not?).
  - O is in position 2: allowed for O (because only position 3 is bad for O, and 2 is not).

And no forbidden letters: A, C, E, R, S, W, Y are all avoided.

""DONUT"" is a valid English word? It might be considered informal, but word games accept variations, and it's commonly used.

 Let's go with ""donut"".

 This guess will help us by:
  - Testing D, U, T which are new.
  - And positions for the known letters N and O.

 It's not required to be uppercase, but we can write in lowercase.

 So, guess: ""donut""

<guess>donut</guess>After analyzing the previous feedback:
- From ""crane"": C, R, A, E are absent; N is present but not in position 4.
- From ""snowy"": S, W, Y are absent; N is present but not in position 2; O is present but not in position 3.

Key deductions:
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, S, W, Y (must avoid).
- **Present letters**: N and O (must include).
- **Position constraints**: 
  - N cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (based on prior guesses), so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
  - O cannot be in position 3, so it must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z (prioritize common letters like D, T, U for testing).

Based on this,""donut"" is chosen as the third guess because:
1. It includes both ""N"" and ""O"" (required), placing:
   - ""N"" in position 3 (allowed, since not excluded and tested position).
   - ""O"" in position 2 (allowed, not excluded for O).
2. It avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, E, S, W, Y).
3. It tests new common letters: D (position 1), U (position 4), and T (position 5), maximizing information.
4. It respects positional constraints and is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess helps narrow down the position of ""N"" and ""O"" while testing three new letters.

So we can try to put \'N\' in a different position.\n\n Possible positions for \'N\': since it was in the 4th position in ""crane"" and that was wrong, we can try positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\n However, note that the feedback does not tell us how many times a letter appears. So the word might have one \'N\' or more? But we only know one is present.\n\n We should also try to include other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has:\n - \'N\' in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4)\n - and uses letters from: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.\n\n Example words:\n - We could try ""saint"" but note that \'A\' is not allowed (we know A is not in the word) -> so avoid A.\n - ""point"": P, O, I, N, T -> but note we haven\'t tried P, O, I, T. However, we must avoid A, C, R, E (which we are). Also, we can put \'N\' in the 4th position? But wait, in the first guess we had \'N\' in the 4th and it was wrong. So if we put \'N\' in the 4th again, it would be the same position and we know it\'s wrong. So we should avoid the 4th position for \'N\'. Therefore, we cannot use ""point"" because it has \'N\' in the 4th.\n\n We need a word with \'N\' not in the 4th.\n\n Let\'s think of words with \'N\' in the 1st: ""night"", ""nasty"" (but avoid A), ""noble"", ""noisy"" (but avoid A? no, A is not in the word so we can use other vowels? Actually, we know A is not in the word, but we can use O, I, U, etc.)\n\n But note: we also know that the word does not have A, so we must avoid A.\n\n Let\'s try ""noisy"": N, O, I, S, Y -> but has O, I, S, Y. However, we don\'t know about these. But wait, ""noisy"" has an \'S\' and \'Y\'. Also, we can check if it\'s valid.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""snowy"": S, N, O, W, Y -> but then \'N\' is in the 2nd position. That\'s acceptable.\n\n However, we must avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, E. ""snowy"" doesn\'t have any of these.\n\n Another option: ""linen"" -> but note we have two N\'s? And we don\'t know if the word has two N\'s. Also, we have an \'E\' which we know is absent? So we cannot use \'E\'. So ""linen"" is invalid because of E.\n\n We must avoid E as well.\n\n So, let\'s list some words without A, C, R, E and with one \'N\' (or possibly two, but we don\'t know) and with \'N\' not in the 4th.\n\n Words:\n - ""nymph"": N, Y, M, P, H -> but that\'s a valid word? Yes. And \'N\' is in the 1st position.\n - ""dingy"": D, I, N, G, Y -> \'N\' in the 3rd position. Avoids A, C, R, E.\n\n But we don\'t know if the word has D, I, G, Y, etc.\n\n Another idea: we want to test as many new common letters as possible. Common letters: S, T, L, O, P, etc.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has \'N\' and also includes S, T, L, O, etc.\n\n Example: ""tonal"" -> but has A (which is absent) -> invalid.\n Example: ""stony"": S, T, O, N, Y -> \'N\' in the 4th? We must avoid 4th for N? But wait, we know that in the first guess the 4th position was wrong for N, but if the word has two N\'s? Then it might be that the 4th position is also N and we get a match? But we don\'t know. However, the feedback only tells us that there is at least one N and it\'s not in the 4th. So if we put N in the 4th again, it might be that the word has only one N and then we get a \'-\' again (if the N is in a different position) or if the word has two N\'s and one of them is in the 4th, then we might get a check. But we don\'t know.\n\n However, to avoid confusion, it\'s better to try a word that has \'N\' in a new position to get more information about the position of N.\n\n So, let\'s avoid the 4th position for now.\n\n Therefore, ""stony"" is not ideal because it has N in the 4th.\n\n How about ""stint"": S, T, I, N, T -> but has two T\'s? And N in the 4th? Again, same issue.\n\n How about ""mount"": M, O, U, N, T -> N in the 4th? Same.\n\n How about ""doing"": D, O, I, N, G -> N in the 4th? Same.\n\n We need to avoid the 4th for N? But we can try it if we have to, but let\'s try to find a word without N in the 4th.\n\n How about ""ninth"": N, I, N, T, H -> has two N\'s? And the first N is in the 1st, and the third letter is N. But we don\'t know if the word has two N\'s. Also, we are avoiding A, C, R, E. This word is valid.\n\n But note: we have two N\'s. We know at least one N is present. If the word has two N\'s, then we might get feedback for both. However, we are not sure.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""sling"": S, L, I, N, G -> N in the 4th? Again.\n\n It\'s hard to avoid the 4th? Maybe we should not avoid the 4th? Because the feedback for the first guess only said that the N in the 4th was wrong, but if the word has two N\'s, then the 4th might be correct? Actually, no: the feedback for the first guess: the N was in the 4th and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that the secret word has an N, but not in the 4th position. Therefore, if we put N in the 4th again, it will definitely be wrong (because the secret word doesn\'t have an N in the 4th). So we should avoid the 4th position for N.\n\n Therefore, we must choose a word that has N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\n Let me try to think of words with N in the 5th? That\'s less common. Example: ""grown"", ""flown"", ""brown"", but we don\'t know if these letters are allowed.\n\n But we can use: ""grown"": G, R, O, W, N -> but wait, R is in the word? We know from the first guess that R is not in the word (because we had R in ""crane"" and it was marked x). So we cannot use R.\n\n Similarly, we cannot use R.\n\n So, avoid R.\n\n How about ""brown"": B, R, O, W, N -> has R -> invalid.\n\n How about ""flown"": F, L, O, W, N -> has L, O, W, N. And no R? But wait, we don\'t have R? Actually, we know R is absent. So ""flown"" has R? No, ""flown"" is F, L, O, W, N -> no R. But we also must avoid A, C, E. This word is okay.\n\n However, we have N in the 5th. That\'s a new position.\n\n But we don\'t know about F, L, O, W.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""known"": K, N, O, W, N -> has two N\'s? And N in the 1st and 5th? But we are allowed to have two N\'s? And we know the word has at least one N. This word is valid.\n\n But let me choose a word that has more common letters. We haven\'t tested S, T, L, O, etc.\n\n How about ""snowy"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N in the 2nd position. This is acceptable.\n\n We can use ""snowy"". It avoids A, C, R, E. It has S, N, O, W, Y.\n\n Another option: ""nobly"": N, O, B, L, Y -> N in the 1st. This is also good.\n\n Let me choose between these.\n\n We want to cover as many common letters as possible. Common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, N, O (but we already know N is in, and we are using O). Also, we haven\'t tested T? So maybe we should include T.\n\n How about ""notch"": but has C and H? We know C is absent, so invalid.\n\n How about ""tonic"": has C and T, O, N, I -> but C is absent -> invalid.\n\n How about ""joint"": J, O, I, N, T -> N in the 4th? We must avoid 4th for N -> so no.\n\n How about ""point"": again, N in the 4th -> avoid.\n\n How about ""night"": N, I, G, H, T -> N in the 1st. This is good. And we avoid A, C, R, E. It has I, G, H, T.\n\n But we don\'t know about these letters.\n\n Alternatively, ""sight"": S, I, G, H, T -> but no N? We must include N because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot use ""sight"".\n\n So, we must include N.\n\n Therefore, ""night"" is a candidate.\n\n Another candidate: ""thing"": T, H, I, N, G -> N in the 4th? Avoid.\n\n How about ""tinge"": but has E -> invalid.\n\n How about ""sting"": S, T, I, N, G -> N in the 4th? Avoid.\n\n How about ""singe"": has E -> invalid.\n\n How about ""minim"": M, I, N, I, M -> has two M\'s and two I\'s? And N in the 3rd. This is acceptable? But it\'s a rare word.\n\n We want a common word.\n\n Let me go with ""night"" or ""snowy"". \n\n I think ""snowy"" is a good choice because it has common letters and N in the 2nd (a new position). Also, it uses S, O, W, Y which we haven\'t tried.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""downy"": D, O, W, N, Y -> N in the 4th? Avoid.\n\n How about ""windy"": W, I, N, D, Y -> N in the 3rd. This is acceptable.\n\n But ""windy"" has D and Y. We haven\'t tried D and Y.\n\n However, I think ""snowy"" is a better choice because it has S which is a very common letter.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""snowy"".\n\n But wait, we have to make sure it\'s a valid word. Yes, ""snowy"" is a valid English word.\n\n Therefore, second guess: ""snowy""\n\n We\'ll get feedback on S, N, O, W, Y.\n\n Let\'s write it in the required format.After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and E are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- N is present but not in the 4th position (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include ""N"" (since it\'s confirmed present) but avoid placing it in the 4th position.\n- Must exclude C, R, A, and E (confirmed absent).\n- Should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, L, Y) to maximize information.\n- Avoid repeating the 4th-position placement for ""N"" to test new positions.\n\nThe word ""snowy"" fits these criteria:\n- Contains ""N"" in the 2nd position (new slot).\n- Uses new common letters: S, O, W, Y.\n- Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).\n- Is a valid 5-letter English word.\n\nThis guess will help identify the position of ""N"" and test four additional letters.\n\n<guess>snowy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: snowy -> FEEDBACK: S(x) N(-) O(-) W(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane""\n- C, R, A, E: absent (x)\n- N: present, but not in the 4th position (so in the word somewhere else)\n\nSecond guess: ""snowy""\n- S, W, Y: absent (x)\n- N: present but not in the 2nd position (where we placed it in ""snowy"")\n- O: present but not in the 3rd position (where we placed it in ""snowy"")\n\nSo, combining the information:\n\nLetters known to be absent: C, R, A, E, S, W, Y\nLetters known to be present: N and O\n\nWe also know that:\n- N is in the word, but not in position 4 (from ""crane"") and not in position 2 (from ""snowy"")\n- O is in the word, but not in position 3 (from ""snowy"")\n\nNow, we need to guess a word that:\n- Contains N and O (since they are present)\n- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, E, S, W, Y\n- Places N not in position 2 or 4\n- Places O not in position 3\n\nWe must use only the remaining letters. English letters available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z (but we should prioritize common ones)\n\nAlso, we need to consider the positions for N and O.\n\nPossible positions for N: 1, 3, or 5 (since 2 and 4 are excluded)\nPossible positions for O: any except 3? Actually, position 3 is excluded for O, so positions 1,2,4,5 are possible for O? But we don\'t know if O can be in 2, etc.\n\nBut note: we don\'t have any constraints on other positions yet.\n\nNow, we know the word has at least N and O, and we have to guess using the available letters.\n\nLet\'s think of common 5-letter words with N and O, avoiding the bad letters.\n\nAlso, since from ""crane"" we had N present, and in ""snowy"" we also have N present, but with different positions, and same for O (only appeared in ""snowy"").\n\nWe can try to include other common letters to test: such as T, L, I, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""point"": but has P, O, I, N, T -> but we must avoid A, C, R, E, S, W, Y. ""point""? It has P,O,I,N,T. None of the forbidden letters? But wait: C, R, A, E, S, W, Y are absent, so P, O, I, N, T are acceptable. Also, positions: in ""point"", N is in position 4? But we know from first guess that N cannot be in position 4! So if we put ""point"", and N is in 4th, then it cannot be correct because N is not in position 4? Therefore, we avoid words with N in position 4.\n\nSimilarly, in ""point"", O is in position 2? That might be okay because we don\'t have constraint against position 2 for O? But for O, we only know it\'s not in position 3. So position 2 is possible.\n\nBut N is in position 4 in ""point"", which is forbidden (because we know N is not in 4th). So we cannot use ""point"" because we know N is not in the 4th?\n\nWait, but if the word is ""point"", then in the first guess ""crane"" we had N in the 4th and got a \'-\' meaning N is in the word but not in that position. If ""point"" has N in the 4th, then for the first guess (if the word was ""point"") the feedback would have been for N: if N is in the 4th then it should be a check, but we got a \'-\' meaning it\'s not in the 4th? Contradiction? So the word cannot be ""point"" because we know N is not in position 4.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid any word that has N in position 4 because we know that position is wrong.\n\nSimilarly, for position 2: we know from ""snowy"" that N is not in position 2? So we also avoid position 2 for N.\n\nTherefore, N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, O must not be in position 3? So O must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nWe need a word that has both N and O with N in 1,3, or 5 and O in 1,2,4,5, but also avoiding forbidden letters.\n\nAnd the word must not use any of the absent letters.\n\nNow, let\'s list possibilities:\n\n- Option 1: N in position 1, O in position 2: e.g., ""NO???"" \n  - But forbidden letters: avoid A, C, E, R, S, W, Y. So words like ""noble"" has A? Wait, ""noble"" has A? Actually, ""noble"" is N,O,B,L,E -> E is forbidden, invalid.\n  - ""nodal"": has A and L? ""nodal"" is N,O,D,A,L -> A is forbidden? Wait, A is absent, so we cannot use A. So invalid.\n  - ""noisy"": but S and Y are forbidden -> invalid.\n  - ""nomad"": has A, invalid.\n  - ""noble"": has E, invalid.\n  - ""noted"": has E, invalid.\n  - ""north"": has R? R is forbidden -> invalid.\n  - ""novel"": has E? Invalid.\n\nIt\'s hard? How about N in 1 and O in 4: e.g., ""N??O?""\n  - For example, ""nitro"": but R and T? R forbidden -> invalid.\n\nAlternatively, N in 1 and O in 5: e.g., ""N???O""\n  - Words like ""nacho"": has A, C -> invalid.\n  - ""nacho"" has A and C -> both forbidden.\n  - Or ""neato"": has A,E -> both forbidden.\n\nNot working? How about N in position 3 and O in another position?\n\nLet me try N in position 3: so ""??N??""\n\nAnd O can be in 1,2,4,5.\n\nFor example, O in 1, N in 3: ""O?N??"" \n  - Words: ""owner"": has W and R? W forbidden -> invalid.\n  - ""oink"": not 5 letters? Must be 5 letters.\n\n""oinks"": has S -> invalid.\n\nO in 2, N in 3: ""?ON??""\n  - Words: ""bonus"": has B, O, N, U, S -> S is forbidden -> invalid.\n  - ""tonic"": has T, O, N, I, C -> C is forbidden -> invalid.\n  - ""donut"": has D, O, N, U, T -> no forbidden letters? Wait, letters: D, O, N, U, T. Avoided A,C,E,R,S,W,Y -> so allowed? But we don\'t know about U. But it\'s possible.\n\n""donut"" is a word, and has O in 2nd, N in 3rd? But we also have U and T.\n\nIs that okay? Yes.\n\nAnother word: ""going"": has G,O,I,N,G -> but N in 4th? Avoid N in 4th? We need N in position 3? In ""going"": positions: G(1),O(2),I(3),N(4),G(4? wait: going is G,O,I,N,G -> so positions:1:G,2:O,3:I,4:N,5:G -> so N is in 4th, which is forbidden? Yes. So we avoid.\n\nN in position 3: so third letter must be N.\n\nSo for ""?ON??"": example ""bonus"" has S -> invalid.\n  - ""font"": not 5 letters.\n  - ""front"": has R -> invalid.\n  - ""mound"": has M,O,U,N,D -> N is in 4th? Wait: M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> so N in 4th -> invalid? But we put N in 4th? So avoid.\n\nWe must have the N in 3rd position? In the pattern ""?ON??"", the N is in the third position? Yes: index 1: first letter, 2: second (O), 3: third (N), ... So if we have N in third position, that\'s allowed.\n\nExample: let X be a letter that is not forbidden.\n\nSo pattern: _ O N _ _\n\nPossible letters: X must be from {B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,P,Q,T,U,V,X,Z} and then the last two also from that set.\n\nWord: ""honey"": H,O,N,E,Y -> E and Y are forbidden -> invalid.\n  - ""ionic"": I,O,N,I,C -> C forbidden -> invalid.\n  - ""money"": M,O,N,E,Y -> E and Y forbidden -> invalid.\n\nAnother one: ""boney"": B,O,E,N,Y -> E forbidden and Y forbidden -> invalid.\n\nHow about ""tonne"": T,O,N,N,E -> E forbidden -> invalid.\n\nOr ""linen"": L,I,N,E,N -> E forbidden -> invalid.\n\nHow about ""phone"": P,H,O,N,E -> E forbidden -> invalid.\n\nIt seems difficult? Perhaps N in position 5.\n\nN in position 5, O in somewhere.\n\nPattern: ""????N"" with O in one of the first four, but not position 3? Actually O can be in 1,2,4? Not 3? So O in 1,2, or 4.\n\nFor example, O in position 1: ""O???N""\n  - ""ocean"": C, A -> forbidden -> invalid.\n  - ""organ"": R, A -> forbidden.\n  - ""ovens"": V,E,N,S -> E and S forbidden -> invalid.\n\nO in position 2: ""?O??N""\n  - ""doing"": D,O,I,N,G -> N is in 4th? Wait: D,O,I,N,G -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> but N is in 4th? So we want N to be in 5th? Then it must be the last letter.\n\nIn ""doing"", N is in 4th, which is forbidden? We need N in 5th? Now we are considering N in 5th.\n\nPattern: ? O ? ? N\n\nSo example: ""brown"": B,R,O,W,N -> R and W forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""grown"": G,R,O,W,N -> R and W -> invalid.\n\n""town"": not 5 letters.\n\n""clown"": C,L,O,W,N -> C and W forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""owner"": O,W,N,E,R -> W,E,R all forbidden -> invalid.\n\nO in position 4: ""???O N"" -> ? ? ? O N\n\nExample: ""felon"": F,E,L,O,N -> E forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""melon"": M,E,L,O,N -> E -> invalid.\n\n""demon"": D,E,M,O,N -> E -> invalid.\n\n""notion"": N,O,T,I,O,N -> six? wait, 5 letters: ""notion"" is 6? Or 5? No, ""notion"" has 6 letters. We need 5.\n\n""motion"": M,O,T,I,O,N -> also 6.\n\n5-letter: ... How about ""llion""? No.\n\nPerhaps I should consider words with N in position 5 and O in position 2? Without forbidden letters.\n\nAnother word: ""booth"": B,O,O,T,H -> no N? Must have N.\n\nAll words must have N.\n\nPerhaps try N in position 3 and O in position 1: ""O?N??""\n  - ""owned"": O,W,N,E,D -> W and E -> invalid.\n  - ""oink"": too short.\n  - ""oinks"": S -> invalid.\n\nHow about O in position 4: ""??N O ?"" (N in 3rd, O in 4th): ? ? N O ?\n\nWords: ""pinto"": P,I,N,T,O -> O in 5th? Positions: P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), O(5) -> but O is in 5th? We were doing N in 3rd and O in 4th? But here O is in 5th.\n\nFor O in 4th: ""??N O ?"" -> first two unknown, then N, then O, then last unknown.\n\nExample: ""union"": U,N,I,O,N -> U is not forbidden? Let\'s see: U(1),N(2),I(3),O(4),N(5) -> but N is in 2nd position? But we have N in 2nd forbidden? Also, the N in the word is in multiple positions.\n\nBut the word must have N in the word, and here it has two N\'s.\n\nIn ""union"", the letters are U, N, I, O, N.\n\nPositions: 1:U, 2:N, 3:I -> but N in position 2 is forbidden? From ""snowy"" we know N is not in position 2. But in ""union"", position 2 is N, which would be wrong. So if we guess ""union"", the feedback will show that N in position 2 is not correct.\n\nBut we know N is present, so if we put it in position 2, it should give \'-\', but we already know it\'s not there? But the purpose of the guess is to test.\n\nActually, we can use a word that has N in position 2 if we want to, but we know it\'s not correct, so it\'s a waste of a letter? We should avoid positions we know are wrong.\n\nSo for N, avoid positions 2 and 4.\n\nIn ""union"", N is in position 2 and 5. Position 2 is bad, position 5 might be good? But we have two N\'s.\n\nWe know at least one N is present. If there is one N, then position 2 is wrong, and the other N is elsewhere? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut we know from previous that N is not in 2 or 4.\n\nIf the word has only one N, then it must be in 1,3, or 5.\n\nIf it has two N\'s, then one might be in 2 or 4, but the feedback from previous guesses said for position 4 of ""crane"": only that there is an N not in position 4, but if there is another N in position 4? Then for ""crane"", the N in position 4 would have been a \'check\' if the word had an N in position 4? But we got \'-\' meaning the N is in the word but not in that position. So if the word had an N in position 4, the feedback would have been \'check\' for that position? Therefore, the word does not have N in position 4 at all. Same for position 2: if we got \'-\' for ""snowy"" position 2 N, that means there\'s an N in the word but not in position 2. Therefore, position 2 does not have N in the secret word.\n\nSo the secret word has N in positions 1, 3, or 5, and definitely not in 2 or 4.\n\nTherefore, in any guess, if we put N in position 2 or 4, we will get a \'-\'.\n\nSo, for efficiency, we should avoid positions 2 and 4 for N, because we know it\'s wrong.\n\nSimilarly for O, we know it\'s not in position 3, so we should avoid position 3 for O.\n\nBack to our word search.\n\nLet\'s try a word with N in position 1 and O in position 5: ""N???O""\n\nPossible words: ""video"": V,I,D,E,O -> E forbidden -> invalid.\n  - ""radio"": R,A,D,I,O -> R and A forbidden -> invalid.\n  - ""nitro"": N,I,T,R,O -> R forbidden -> invalid.\n  - ""disco"": D,I,S,C,O -> S and C forbidden -> invalid.\n\nNot working.\n\nN in position 1 and O in position 4: ""N??O?""\n  - ""ノート"" not English.\n  - ""notch"": N,O,T,C,H -> C forbidden -> invalid.\n  - ""north"": N,O,R,T,H -> R forbidden -> invalid.\n  - ""novel"": N,O,V,E,L -> E forbidden -> invalid.\n\nN in position 3 and O in position 1: ""O?N??""\n  - ""ontic"": O,N,T,I,C -> C forbidden -> invalid.\n  - ""onion"": O,N,I,O,N -> positions: O(1), N(2), I(3), O(4), N(5)\n    - But N is in position 2? That is not allowed! We will get N in position 2 as wrong, but we know it\'s wrong, and it uses a space.\n\n""onth"": not a word.\n\nN in position 3 and O in position 2: ""?ON??""\n  - ""boned"": B,O,N,E,D -> E forbidden -> invalid.\n  - ""bonds"": B,O,N,D,S -> S forbidden -> invalid.\n  - ""bound"": B,O,U,N,D -> U and D might be okay, but is it valid? Bound is a word, but let\'s see letters: B,O,U,N,D. None forbidden? Forbidden letters are C, R, A, E, S, W, Y. So B, O, U, N, D are all okay.\n\nAnd positions: B(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> wait, N is in position 4? That\'s forbidden!\n\nIn ""bound"", spelling: B-O-U-N-D -> positions: 1:B,2:O,3:U,4:N,5:D -> so N in 4th? Forbidden.\n\nWe must have N in 1,3, or 5? In this pattern, for ""?ON??"", the N is in position 3? How? Pattern: index 1: first letter, 2: O, 3: N, 4: fourth letter, 5: fifth letter.\n\nSo if I have a word like ""XONYZ"", then N is in position 3? Which is allowed? Because we need N in 1,3, or 5.\n\nSo N in position 3 is allowed.\n\nSimilarly, O is in position 2, which is not position 3, so allowed.\n\nLet\'s find words in the form ""XONYZ"" where X,O,N are fixed? No, X can be any allowed letter, then O in 2, N in 3, and Y and Z any allowed letters.\n\nAnd the word must be valid.\n\nExamples with X from allowed letters, Y, Z from allowed letters.\n\nPossible X: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,P,Q,T,U,V,X,Z\n\nY and Z same\n\nWord: ""done"": too short.\n\n""phone"": has E -> invalid.\n\n""clone"": has C and E -> invalid.\n\n""stone"": has S and E -> invalid.\n\n""monk"": not 5 letters.\n\n""tonne"": has E -> invalid.\n\n""coned"": has C and E -> invalid.\n\n""zoned"": has Z,O,N,E,D -> E forbidden -> invalid, and Z is allowed? Forbidden letters are C,R,A,E,S,W,Y, so Z is allowed? Yes, but ""zoned"" has E -> invalid.\n\n""honed"": H,O,N,E,D -> E -> invalid.\n\nDoned? Not a word.\n\n How about ""bound"" spelled with N at position 3? That would be B,O,U,N,D -> positions: B(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> so N is not in position 3.\n\n To have N in position 3: the third letter must be N.\n\nSo for ""XONYZ"", it is: position1: X, 2: O, 3: N? No, ""XON"" would be positions: first: X, second: O, third: the letter we put for third? But we want N in third? So the third letter must be N, so in a word, it should be like ""X"" then O then N ... no? The format is position2 O and position3 N, so the word should be X (pos1), O (pos2), N (pos3), Y (pos4), Z (pos5).\n\n So spelling: X O N Y Z\n\n For example: ""gong"": not 5 letters.\n\n ""long"": not 5.\n\n ""bong"": B,O,N,G -> too short.\n\n 5-letter words: ""bonds"": B,O,N,D,S -> S forbidden -> invalid.\n   - ""dons"": not 5.\n   - ""font"": not 5.\n   - ""lion"": not 5.\n\n How about ""donut"" but we want the form with position2=O and position3=N? ""donut"" is D O N U T -> positions: D(1), O(2), N(3), U(4), T(5) -> yes! This is the form.\n\n N is in position 3? Which is allowed, since position 3 is not 2 or 4.\n\n O is in position 2? Which is allowed, since it\'s not position 3.\n\n And the word ""donut"" uses D,O,N,U,T -> all allowed letters (not in forbidden list).\n\n D is allowed? Yes.\n O is in there.\n N is in position 3.\n U and T are allowed? Yes, not forbidden.\n\n Why didn\'t I think of ""donut"" earlier?\n\n let\'s confirm:\n Guess: ""donut""\n Positions: 1: D, 2: O, 3: N, 4: U, 5: T\n Constraints:\n  - N is in position 3: allowed (because only positions 2 and 4 are bad for N, and 3 is not?).\n  - O is in position 2: allowed for O (because only position 3 is bad for O, and 2 is not).\n\nAnd no forbidden letters: A, C, E, R, S, W, Y are all avoided.\n\n""DONUT"" is a valid English word? It might be considered informal, but word games accept variations, and it\'s commonly used.\n\n Let\'s go with ""donut"".\n\n This guess will help us by:\n  - Testing D, U, T which are new.\n  - And positions for the known letters N and O.\n\n It\'s not required to be uppercase, but we can write in lowercase.\n\n So, guess: ""donut""\n\n<guess>donut</guess>After analyzing the previous feedback:\n- From ""crane"": C, R, A, E are absent; N is present but not in position 4.\n- From ""snowy"": S, W, Y are absent; N is present but not in position 2; O is present but not in position 3.\n\nKey deductions:\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, S, W, Y (must avoid).\n- **Present letters**: N and O (must include).\n- **Position constraints**: \n  - N cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (based on prior guesses), so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.\n  - O cannot be in position 3, so it must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z (prioritize common letters like D, T, U for testing).\n\nBased on this,""donut"" is chosen as the third guess because:\n1. It includes both ""N"" and ""O"" (required), placing:\n   - ""N"" in position 3 (allowed, since not excluded and tested position).\n   - ""O"" in position 2 (allowed, not excluded for O).\n2. It avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, E, S, W, Y).\n3. It tests new common letters: D (position 1), U (position 4), and T (position 5), maximizing information.\n4. It respects positional constraints and is a valid 5-letter English word.\n\nThis guess helps narrow down the position of ""N"" and ""O"" while testing three new letters.\n\n<guess>donut</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: snowy -> FEEDBACK: S(x) N(-) O(-) W(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: donut -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(✓) N(-) U(x) T(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from the third guess ""donut"":
- D: x (absent)
- O: ✓ (correct position, so O is in position 2)
- N: - (present but wrong position; since O is fixed at position 2, and N is present but not in position 3)
- U: x (absent)
- T: - (present but wrong position)

So, new information:
- O is confirmed in position 2 (so the secret word has O as the second letter).
- T is present in the word but not in position 5 (since we got '-' for T in position 5).
- N is present but not in position 3 (and we already knew not in 2 or 4, so now N must be in position 1 or 5? But wait, we have position 1,3,5 available? But now position 3 is also excluded? So N must be in position 1 or 5).
- D and U are absent (so add to absent list).

Also, from previous:
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, S, W, Y, D, U
- Present letters: O (fixed at position 2), N, T (and we know N and T are present but not in certain positions)

Now, we know:
- Position 2 is O.
- N is present and must be in position 1 or 5 (since positions 2,3,4 are excluded: 2 by ""snowy"", 3 by ""donut"", 4 by ""crane"").
- T is present and not in position 5 (from ""donut"" feedback) and we don't know about other positions? But we haven't tested T in other positions.

Also, we have to find the remaining letters. The word has 5 letters: we know position 2 is O, and we know N and T are present, so the word has at least O, N, T. And there are two more letters? Or could there be duplicates? But we don't know.

The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, so we assume no duplicates for now? But it's possible.

We have to consider that there might be duplicates, but we haven't seen any yet.

Now, the secret word: positions:
1: ? (could be N or T or a new letter, but we know N must be in 1 or 5)
2: O (fixed)
3: ? (cannot be N, and not O? O is already in 2, so if no duplicates, then not O. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Wordle allows duplicates, but we haven't encountered any. So we should consider the possibility, but without evidence, we might assume no duplicates for now to simplify.)
4: ? (cannot be N, and not O? same as above)
5: ? (could be N or T or new, but T is not in 5, so if N is in 5, then position 5 is N, and T must be in 1,3, or4? but T is not in 5, so it can be in 1,3,4)

But we know T is present and not in 5, so T must be in 1,3, or4.

Similarly, N must be in 1 or 5.

So, two cases:

Case 1: N in position 1.
Then the word is: N O ? ? ?
And T is present in position 3 or 4 (since not 5, and not 2 because O is there).

Case 2: N in position 5.
Then the word is: ? O ? ? N
And T is present in position 1,3, or4.

Also, we have to fill the remaining positions with letters not in the absent list.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, V, X, Z (and possibly others, but common ones: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P)

Now, we need to make a guess that helps us distinguish and find the word.

We should try to test both cases and also cover new letters.

But we have only 3 guesses left? We are on guess 4.

We know O is fixed at position 2.

Let's list possible words.

First, case 1: N in position 1, so word: N O _ _ _

Then T must be in position 3 or 4.

Also, the remaining two positions must be filled with two letters from the available set.

For example, if T in position 3: N O T _ _
Then we need two more letters for positions 4 and 5.

Possible words: NOTED (but E and D are absent), NOTCH (C absent), etc. But we have to avoid absent letters.

Available letters: B,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,P,Q,V,X,Z

So, possible: NOTH? But 4 letters? 5-letter words: NOT with two more letters.

Examples: NOTED (invalid), NOTUM (not common), NOTAL (not common), NOTCH (invalid).

How about ""north""? But R absent.

""noted"" has E and D -> absent.

""notum"" is a word? But U is absent? U is absent, so invalid.

""nodal"" has A and D -> absent.

No common words? How about ""noble""? A and E absent? ""noble"" has A? N,O,B,L,E -> A not in, but E is absent -> invalid.

""novel"" has E and V? V is allowed, but E absent -> invalid.

Perhaps T in position 4: N O _ T _

Then word: N O ? T ?

Available letters for position 3 and 5.

Position 3: cannot be N (already), O (already), T (if no duplicate), so must be a new letter.

Position 5: new letter.

Words: NOINT (not common), NOIST (not common), or ""point"" but P,O,I,N,T -> but N is in position 1, so if ""point"" would be P,O,I,N,T -> but we have N in 1, so not.

We are building N O ? T ?

So, for example, ""motte"" but E absent.

""notte"" not a word.

""lotto"" has two T's? But T is already in position 4, so if we have T in position 5, it's duplicate? Possible? But we don't know.

""lotto"" is L,O,T,T,O -> but O duplicate? And we have O in position 2.

But let's not assume duplicates.

Common words: ""north"" invalid.

""noted"" invalid.

Case 1 seems difficult.

Case 2: N in position 5, so word: ? O ? ? N

And T is present in position 1,3, or4.

If T in position 1: T O ? ? N

Then positions 3 and 4 to fill.

Words: T O _ _ N

Examples: TOXIN (X and I, but X is allowed? and I allowed), but ""toxin"" has X and I.

""topin"" not a word.

""tomin"" not common.

""token"" has K and E -> E absent -> invalid.

""toman"" has A and M -> A absent -> invalid.

""toran"" has R and A -> absent.

""tobin"" has B and I -> allowed? T,O,B,I,N -> positions: T(1),O(2),B(3),I(4),N(5) -> and letters: T,O,B,I,N. All allowed? Absent letters: C,R,A,E,S,W,Y,D,U. So B and I are allowed.

""tobin"" is a valid word? It might be a name, but let's see if it's accepted. In Wordle, sometimes proper nouns are not, but ""tobin"" might not be common.

""login"" has G and I, but L? ""login"" is L,O,G,I,N -> but we have T in position 1? No, ""login"" has L in 1.

We need T in 1.

""ton"" something, but N is in 5.

""town"" has W -> absent.

How about ""tomin""? Not common.

Perhaps T in position 3: ? O T ? N

Word: _ O T _ N

Examples: MOTOR (M,O,T,O,R -> R absent and O duplicate)
  - BOTHY (B,O,T,H,Y -> Y absent)
  - MOTH? 4 letters.
  - ""motif"" M,O,T,I,F -> F and I allowed, and N in position 5? But we have _ O T _ N, so position 5 is N, so ""motif"" is only 5 letters? M,O,T,I,F -> no N? So not.

We need the last letter to be N.

So ""motin"" not a word.

""potin"" not common.

""lotus"" has U and S -> absent.

""botch"" has C and H -> C absent.

Not working.

T in position 4: ? O ? T N

Word: _ O _ T N

Examples: POETRY is 6 letters.

5-letter: ""point"" is P,O,I,N,T -> but N is in position 4? But we have position 5 as N, so not.

""point"" has N in 4, but we need N in 5.

""baton"" has A -> absent.

""moton"" not a word.

""button"" has U and two T's.

""latin"" has A -> absent.

""matin"" has A -> absent.

""patio"" has A and I,O -> but no N? ""patio"" is P,A,T,I,O -> no N.

We need the word to end with T N.

So ""eaten"" has E and A -> absent.

""often"" has E and F,T -> E absent.

""overt"" has R and E -> absent.

""outre"" has U and E -> absent.

It's challenging.

Perhaps we missed something.

Another possibility: in case 2, with N in position 5, and T in position 1: T O _ _ N

We have ""t o _ _ n""

Common words: ""token"" invalid, ""toxin"" might work, but let's see letters: T,O,X,I,N -> X and I are allowed.

""toxin"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""tamin"" has A -> invalid.

""topin"" not common.

""t o m i n"" -> ""tomin"" not common.

""t o w n"" -> W absent.

So ""toxin"" is a possibility.

Similarly, in case 1, with N in 1 and T in 3: N O T _ _

We can have ""n o t c h"" but C absent.

""n o t e d"" E and D absent.

""n o t u m"" U absent.

""n o t a l"" A absent.

""n o t h k"" not a word.

""n o t i c"" C absent.

So no common words for case 1.

Therefore, case 2 is more likely: N in position 5, and T in position 1 or 3 or 4.

But with T in position 1: ""t o _ _ n""

Words: ""toxin"" (T,O,X,I,N)

Or ""t o p i n"" ""topin"" not common.

""t o b i n"" ""tobin"" (a surname, but might be accepted).

""t o k i n"" ""tokin"" not common.

""t o n g n"" not.

So ""toxin"" is a candidate.

But we have to consider that in ""donut"", T was in position 5 and got '-', meaning T is present but not in position 5. So if we put T in position 1, it might be correct or not.

Similarly, for the guess, we can choose a word that tests these possibilities.

But we also have to account for the remaining letters.

Another idea: we know O is fixed at 2, and we have N and T present, so the word has three more letters? No, the word has five letters: position 1,3,4,5 are unknown except for the constraints.

Positions: 1,3,4,5 to be filled with letters including N and T and two others? Or one other if N and T are in different positions.

Since we have two present letters besides O: N and T, and O is one, so the word has O, N, T, and two other letters from the available set.

Available letters: B,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,P,Q,V,X,Z

For the guess, we can try to cover common letters.

We know N must be in 1 or 5, and T in 1,3,4 but not 5.

So for the next guess, we can try to set N in position 1 and T in position 3, for example, and fill the other positions with common letters to test.

But we need a valid word.

Let's try to form a word with N in 1, O in 2, T in 3, and then positions 4 and 5 with new letters.

For example, ""NOT"" + two letters.

""NOT"" is positions 1,2,3: N,O,T.

Then position 4 and 5: say H and X? ""nothx"" not a word.

""n o t i c"" C absent.

""n o t u m"" U absent.

""n o t e s"" E and S absent.

Not working.

With N in position 5 and T in position 1: ""T"" + O + two letters + ""N""

""T O _ _ N""

With two letters from available.

For example, ""T O P I N"" -> ""topin"" not common.

""T O B I N"" -> ""tobin"" (acceptable? We'll assume it is for now)

""T O X I N"" -> ""toxin"" (valid)

""T O K I N"" -> ""tokin"" not common.

""T O M I N"" -> ""tomin"" not common.

""T O L I N"" -> ""tolin"" not common.

""T O V I N"" -> ""tovin"" not common.

So ""toxin"" is the most common.

We can try ""toxin"".

But let's see if there are other options.

Another possibility: T in position 3 with N in position 5.

Word: _ O T _ N

Examples: ""M O T I N"" -> ""motin"" not common.

""B O T H N"" not a word.

""L O T I N"" not.

""P O T I N"" not.

"" H O T L N"" not.

No common words.

T in position 4 with N in position 5: _ O _ T N

""B O U T N"" U absent.

"" P O S T N"" S absent.

"" G O A T N"" A absent.

"" L O F T N"" ""loftn"" not a word.

So the only common word we have is ""toxin"" for case 2.

Therefore, we guess ""toxin"".

But in ""toxin"", we have T in position 1, O in 2, X in 3, I in 4, N in 5.

Now, check constraints:
- N is in position 5: allowed (since not 2,3,4)
- O in position 2: fixed and correct.
- T in position 1: we don't know yet, but it might be correct or not.
- X and I are new.

Also, from ""donut"", T was in position 5 and got '-', so T is not in 5, which is good because in ""toxin"" it's in 1.

N in position 5 is allowed.

So let's go with ""toxin"".

</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)**  
  - Absent letters: C, R, A, E  
  - Present letter: N (but not in position 4)  

- **Guess 2: ""snowy"" → Feedback: S(x), N(-), O(-), W(x), Y(x)**  
  - Absent letters: S, W, Y (added to absent list)  
  - Present letters: N (not in position 2), O (not in position 3)  

- **Guess 3: ""donut"" → Feedback: D(x), O(✓), N(-), U(x), T(-)**  
  - Absent letters: D, U (added to absent list)  
  - Correct position: O is in position 2 (confirmed)  
  - Present letters:  
    - N (present but not in position 3; combined with prior feedback, N cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4, so it must be in position 1 or 5)  
    - T (present but not in position 5)  

### Key Deductions
- **Confirmed positions**:  
  - Position 2: O (fixed)  
- **Present letters**: N, T (both must appear in the word, with specific constraints):  
  - N: Must be in position 1 or 5 (positions 2, 3, and 4 are invalid based on feedback).  
  - T: Must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (position 5 is invalid).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, S, W, Y, D, U (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, V, X, Z (focus on common letters like I, H, P, L, M).  
- **Word structure**:  
  - Position 2 is fixed as O.  
  - Positions 1, 3, 4, and 5 must include N and T (with N in 1/5 and T in 1/3/4), plus two new letters from the available set.  
  - No duplicates are indicated yet, but we must allow for the possibility.  

### Strategy for Guess 4
- **Prioritize testing N and T positions**:  
  - Since N must be in position 1 or 5, and T in 1, 3, or 4, we need a guess that:  
    - Places N in position 1 or 5 to verify its location.  
    - Places T in a new position (not tested in position 5) to gather more feedback.  
    - Uses common available letters to maximize information.  
- **Word selection**:  
  - After evaluating options (e.g., ""toxin"", ""tobin"", ""login""), ""toxin"" is chosen because:  
    - It tests N in position 5 (allowed) and T in position 1 (new position for T).  
    - It includes O in position 2 (fixed).  
    - It tests new common letters: X (position 3) and I (position 4).  
    - It avoids all absent letters.  
    - It is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning: a poisonous substance).  
- **Expected outcomes**:  
  - If N is in position 5, we may get a ✓ or - for N.  
  - If T is in position 1, we may get a ✓ or - for T.  
  - Feedback on X and I will help narrow down the remaining letters.  

<guess>toxin</guess>",toxin,"We have feedback from the third guess ""donut"":
- D: x (absent)
- O: ✓ (correct position, so O is in position 2)
- N: - (present but wrong position; since O is fixed at position 2, and N is present but not in position 3)
- U: x (absent)
- T: - (present but wrong position)

So, new information:
- O is confirmed in position 2 (so the secret word has O as the second letter).
- T is present in the word but not in position 5 (since we got '-' for T in position 5).
- N is present but not in position 3 (and we already knew not in 2 or 4, so now N must be in position 1 or 5? But wait, we have position 1,3,5 available? But now position 3 is also excluded? So N must be in position 1 or 5).
- D and U are absent (so add to absent list).

Also, from previous:
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, S, W, Y, D, U
- Present letters: O (fixed at position 2), N, T (and we know N and T are present but not in certain positions)

Now, we know:
- Position 2 is O.
- N is present and must be in position 1 or 5 (since positions 2,3,4 are excluded: 2 by ""snowy"", 3 by ""donut"", 4 by ""crane"").
- T is present and not in position 5 (from ""donut"" feedback) and we don't know about other positions? But we haven't tested T in other positions.

Also, we have to find the remaining letters. The word has 5 letters: we know position 2 is O, and we know N and T are present, so the word has at least O, N, T. And there are two more letters? Or could there be duplicates? But we don't know.

The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, so we assume no duplicates for now? But it's possible.

We have to consider that there might be duplicates, but we haven't seen any yet.

Now, the secret word: positions:
1: ? (could be N or T or a new letter, but we know N must be in 1 or 5)
2: O (fixed)
3: ? (cannot be N, and not O? O is already in 2, so if no duplicates, then not O. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Wordle allows duplicates, but we haven't encountered any. So we should consider the possibility, but without evidence, we might assume no duplicates for now to simplify.)
4: ? (cannot be N, and not O? same as above)
5: ? (could be N or T or new, but T is not in 5, so if N is in 5, then position 5 is N, and T must be in 1,3, or4? but T is not in 5, so it can be in 1,3,4)

But we know T is present and not in 5, so T must be in 1,3, or4.

Similarly, N must be in 1 or 5.

So, two cases:

Case 1: N in position 1.
Then the word is: N O ? ? ?
And T is present in position 3 or 4 (since not 5, and not 2 because O is there).

Case 2: N in position 5.
Then the word is: ? O ? ? N
And T is present in position 1,3, or4.

Also, we have to fill the remaining positions with letters not in the absent list.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, V, X, Z (and possibly others, but common ones: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P)

Now, we need to make a guess that helps us distinguish and find the word.

We should try to test both cases and also cover new letters.

But we have only 3 guesses left? We are on guess 4.

We know O is fixed at position 2.

Let's list possible words.

First, case 1: N in position 1, so word: N O _ _ _

Then T must be in position 3 or 4.

Also, the remaining two positions must be filled with two letters from the available set.

For example, if T in position 3: N O T _ _
Then we need two more letters for positions 4 and 5.

Possible words: NOTED (but E and D are absent), NOTCH (C absent), etc. But we have to avoid absent letters.

Available letters: B,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,P,Q,V,X,Z

So, possible: NOTH? But 4 letters? 5-letter words: NOT with two more letters.

Examples: NOTED (invalid), NOTUM (not common), NOTAL (not common), NOTCH (invalid).

How about ""north""? But R absent.

""noted"" has E and D -> absent.

""notum"" is a word? But U is absent? U is absent, so invalid.

""nodal"" has A and D -> absent.

No common words? How about ""noble""? A and E absent? ""noble"" has A? N,O,B,L,E -> A not in, but E is absent -> invalid.

""novel"" has E and V? V is allowed, but E absent -> invalid.

Perhaps T in position 4: N O _ T _

Then word: N O ? T ?

Available letters for position 3 and 5.

Position 3: cannot be N (already), O (already), T (if no duplicate), so must be a new letter.

Position 5: new letter.

Words: NOINT (not common), NOIST (not common), or ""point"" but P,O,I,N,T -> but N is in position 1, so if ""point"" would be P,O,I,N,T -> but we have N in 1, so not.

We are building N O ? T ?

So, for example, ""motte"" but E absent.

""notte"" not a word.

""lotto"" has two T's? But T is already in position 4, so if we have T in position 5, it's duplicate? Possible? But we don't know.

""lotto"" is L,O,T,T,O -> but O duplicate? And we have O in position 2.

But let's not assume duplicates.

Common words: ""north"" invalid.

""noted"" invalid.

Case 1 seems difficult.

Case 2: N in position 5, so word: ? O ? ? N

And T is present in position 1,3, or4.

If T in position 1: T O ? ? N

Then positions 3 and 4 to fill.

Words: T O _ _ N

Examples: TOXIN (X and I, but X is allowed? and I allowed), but ""toxin"" has X and I.

""topin"" not a word.

""tomin"" not common.

""token"" has K and E -> E absent -> invalid.

""toman"" has A and M -> A absent -> invalid.

""toran"" has R and A -> absent.

""tobin"" has B and I -> allowed? T,O,B,I,N -> positions: T(1),O(2),B(3),I(4),N(5) -> and letters: T,O,B,I,N. All allowed? Absent letters: C,R,A,E,S,W,Y,D,U. So B and I are allowed.

""tobin"" is a valid word? It might be a name, but let's see if it's accepted. In Wordle, sometimes proper nouns are not, but ""tobin"" might not be common.

""login"" has G and I, but L? ""login"" is L,O,G,I,N -> but we have T in position 1? No, ""login"" has L in 1.

We need T in 1.

""ton"" something, but N is in 5.

""town"" has W -> absent.

How about ""tomin""? Not common.

Perhaps T in position 3: ? O T ? N

Word: _ O T _ N

Examples: MOTOR (M,O,T,O,R -> R absent and O duplicate)
  - BOTHY (B,O,T,H,Y -> Y absent)
  - MOTH? 4 letters.
  - ""motif"" M,O,T,I,F -> F and I allowed, and N in position 5? But we have _ O T _ N, so position 5 is N, so ""motif"" is only 5 letters? M,O,T,I,F -> no N? So not.

We need the last letter to be N.

So ""motin"" not a word.

""potin"" not common.

""lotus"" has U and S -> absent.

""botch"" has C and H -> C absent.

Not working.

T in position 4: ? O ? T N

Word: _ O _ T N

Examples: POETRY is 6 letters.

5-letter: ""point"" is P,O,I,N,T -> but N is in position 4? But we have position 5 as N, so not.

""point"" has N in 4, but we need N in 5.

""baton"" has A -> absent.

""moton"" not a word.

""button"" has U and two T's.

""latin"" has A -> absent.

""matin"" has A -> absent.

""patio"" has A and I,O -> but no N? ""patio"" is P,A,T,I,O -> no N.

We need the word to end with T N.

So ""eaten"" has E and A -> absent.

""often"" has E and F,T -> E absent.

""overt"" has R and E -> absent.

""outre"" has U and E -> absent.

It's challenging.

Perhaps we missed something.

Another possibility: in case 2, with N in position 5, and T in position 1: T O _ _ N

We have ""t o _ _ n""

Common words: ""token"" invalid, ""toxin"" might work, but let's see letters: T,O,X,I,N -> X and I are allowed.

""toxin"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""tamin"" has A -> invalid.

""topin"" not common.

""t o m i n"" -> ""tomin"" not common.

""t o w n"" -> W absent.

So ""toxin"" is a possibility.

Similarly, in case 1, with N in 1 and T in 3: N O T _ _

We can have ""n o t c h"" but C absent.

""n o t e d"" E and D absent.

""n o t u m"" U absent.

""n o t a l"" A absent.

""n o t h k"" not a word.

""n o t i c"" C absent.

So no common words for case 1.

Therefore, case 2 is more likely: N in position 5, and T in position 1 or 3 or 4.

But with T in position 1: ""t o _ _ n""

Words: ""toxin"" (T,O,X,I,N)

Or ""t o p i n"" ""topin"" not common.

""t o b i n"" ""tobin"" (a surname, but might be accepted).

""t o k i n"" ""tokin"" not common.

""t o n g n"" not.

So ""toxin"" is a candidate.

But we have to consider that in ""donut"", T was in position 5 and got '-', meaning T is present but not in position 5. So if we put T in position 1, it might be correct or not.

Similarly, for the guess, we can choose a word that tests these possibilities.

But we also have to account for the remaining letters.

Another idea: we know O is fixed at 2, and we have N and T present, so the word has three more letters? No, the word has five letters: position 1,3,4,5 are unknown except for the constraints.

Positions: 1,3,4,5 to be filled with letters including N and T and two others? Or one other if N and T are in different positions.

Since we have two present letters besides O: N and T, and O is one, so the word has O, N, T, and two other letters from the available set.

Available letters: B,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,P,Q,V,X,Z

For the guess, we can try to cover common letters.

We know N must be in 1 or 5, and T in 1,3,4 but not 5.

So for the next guess, we can try to set N in position 1 and T in position 3, for example, and fill the other positions with common letters to test.

But we need a valid word.

Let's try to form a word with N in 1, O in 2, T in 3, and then positions 4 and 5 with new letters.

For example, ""NOT"" + two letters.

""NOT"" is positions 1,2,3: N,O,T.

Then position 4 and 5: say H and X? ""nothx"" not a word.

""n o t i c"" C absent.

""n o t u m"" U absent.

""n o t e s"" E and S absent.

Not working.

With N in position 5 and T in position 1: ""T"" + O + two letters + ""N""

""T O _ _ N""

With two letters from available.

For example, ""T O P I N"" -> ""topin"" not common.

""T O B I N"" -> ""tobin"" (acceptable? We'll assume it is for now)

""T O X I N"" -> ""toxin"" (valid)

""T O K I N"" -> ""tokin"" not common.

""T O M I N"" -> ""tomin"" not common.

""T O L I N"" -> ""tolin"" not common.

""T O V I N"" -> ""tovin"" not common.

So ""toxin"" is the most common.

We can try ""toxin"".

But let's see if there are other options.

Another possibility: T in position 3 with N in position 5.

Word: _ O T _ N

Examples: ""M O T I N"" -> ""motin"" not common.

""B O T H N"" not a word.

""L O T I N"" not.

""P O T I N"" not.

"" H O T L N"" not.

No common words.

T in position 4 with N in position 5: _ O _ T N

""B O U T N"" U absent.

"" P O S T N"" S absent.

"" G O A T N"" A absent.

"" L O F T N"" ""loftn"" not a word.

So the only common word we have is ""toxin"" for case 2.

Therefore, we guess ""toxin"".

But in ""toxin"", we have T in position 1, O in 2, X in 3, I in 4, N in 5.

Now, check constraints:
- N is in position 5: allowed (since not 2,3,4)
- O in position 2: fixed and correct.
- T in position 1: we don't know yet, but it might be correct or not.
- X and I are new.

Also, from ""donut"", T was in position 5 and got '-', so T is not in 5, which is good because in ""toxin"" it's in 1.

N in position 5 is allowed.

So let's go with ""toxin"".

<guess>toxin</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)**  
  - Absent letters: C, R, A, E  
  - Present letter: N (but not in position 4)  

- **Guess 2: ""snowy"" → Feedback: S(x), N(-), O(-), W(x), Y(x)**  
  - Absent letters: S, W, Y (added to absent list)  
  - Present letters: N (not in position 2), O (not in position 3)  

- **Guess 3: ""donut"" → Feedback: D(x), O(✓), N(-), U(x), T(-)**  
  - Absent letters: D, U (added to absent list)  
  - Correct position: O is in position 2 (confirmed)  
  - Present letters:  
    - N (present but not in position 3; combined with prior feedback, N cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4, so it must be in position 1 or 5)  
    - T (present but not in position 5)  

### Key Deductions
- **Confirmed positions**:  
  - Position 2: O (fixed)  
- **Present letters**: N, T (both must appear in the word, with specific constraints):  
  - N: Must be in position 1 or 5 (positions 2, 3, and 4 are invalid based on feedback).  
  - T: Must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (position 5 is invalid).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, S, W, Y, D, U (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, V, X, Z (focus on common letters like I, H, P, L, M).  
- **Word structure**:  
  - Position 2 is fixed as O.  
  - Positions 1, 3, 4, and 5 must include N and T (with N in 1/5 and T in 1/3/4), plus two new letters from the available set.  
  - No duplicates are indicated yet, but we must allow for the possibility.  

### Strategy for Guess 4
- **Prioritize testing N and T positions**:  
  - Since N must be in position 1 or 5, and T in 1, 3, or 4, we need a guess that:  
    - Places N in position 1 or 5 to verify its location.  
    - Places T in a new position (not tested in position 5) to gather more feedback.  
    - Uses common available letters to maximize information.  
- **Word selection**:  
  - After evaluating options (e.g., ""toxin"", ""tobin"", ""login""), ""toxin"" is chosen because:  
    - It tests N in position 5 (allowed) and T in position 1 (new position for T).  
    - It includes O in position 2 (fixed).  
    - It tests new common letters: X (position 3) and I (position 4).  
    - It avoids all absent letters.  
    - It is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning: a poisonous substance).  
- **Expected outcomes**:  
  - If N is in position 5, we may get a ✓ or - for N.  
  - If T is in position 1, we may get a ✓ or - for T.  
  - Feedback on X and I will help narrow down the remaining letters.",Guess 4: toxin -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) O(✓) X(✓) I(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
