We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are all frequent in English words.

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for our first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains R, N, and E, but not in the positions we guessed (positions 2, 4, and 5 respectively).
- The letters C and A are not in the word.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not include C or A (since they are absent).
- Includes R, N, E, but in different positions than in ""crane"".
- Also, we want to cover more letters to get more information.

Recall the positions in ""crane"":
1. C (x) -> absent
2. R (-) -> present, but not in position 2
3. A (x) -> absent
4. N (-) -> present, but not in position 4
5. E (-) -> present, but not in position 5

Therefore, in the next guess:
- We must avoid using C and A.
- We must include R, N, and E, but not in positions 2, 4, or 5? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us they are never in those positions, only that in this guess they weren't correct. However, since we know R is in the word but not in position 2, we should avoid putting R in position 2 again. Similarly, avoid N in position 4 and E in position 5? Actually, we might try them in other positions? No: For example, the R could be in a different position, but we don't know if it might be in position 1, 3, etc. But we know it's not at position 2. Similarly, we know N is not at 4, and E is not at 5.

But note: We don't know if R can be at position 1 or 3, etc., so we can try R in a new position? Actually, we can.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Given that we know R, N, E are present, and we have three letters to place, we should try to make a word that includes R, N, E and two new letters.

We also know that the word does not contain C and A.

Let's think of common letters: besides R, N, E, we have T, O, I, S, L, etc.

We should avoid repeating the same positions for R, N, E.

So for R: since it was in position 2 and is wrong, we can try it in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 5 might be E's? Wait, we don't know.

We know E cannot be at position 5 (from the feedback) but R could be at position 5? Possibly.

But we also know E is in the word, so we need to place E in position 1,2,3, or 4? Similarly, N must be in position 1,2,3, or 5? Because it cannot be in position 4? Wait, no: the feedback only says that in our guess, the N was in position 4 and that was wrong. But in the secret word, N can be anywhere except position 4? No, the feedback doesn't say that N cannot be at position 4. Let me clarify:

The feedback symbol '-' for a letter means that the letter is in the word but not in that position. So:
- R is in the word, but not in position 2.
- N is in the word, but not in position 4.
- E is in the word, but not in position 5.

It does not say anything about other positions. So R could be at 1,3,4, or 5? But note that if we put R in position 4, that might be possible because originally R was in position 2 and was wrong, and we have no info about position 4 for R? Similarly for N: we know it isn't at 4, so it can be at 1,2,3,5? And E isn't at 5, so it can be at 1,2,3,4.

So in the next guess, we can try R at a position that is not 2, N not at 4, E not at 5.

We also want to cover new letters.

Let's try to pick a word that has R, N, E and two new letters, such that:
- R is not at position 2
- N is not at position 4
- E is not at position 5

Additionally, we should try to avoid the absent letters (C and A).

Let me think of words: 

We could try putting R at position 1? Then N and E in other positions.

Example words: 
- R? N? E?

But also we want to cover new consonants/vowels.

Common words: since we have R, N, E, we can try to form words like ""RINSE"", ""RENEW"", etc. But ""RINSE"": let's see positions.

If we try ""RINSE"":
- R at position 1
- I at position 2 (new letter)
- N at position 3 (which is okay because we know N can be at 3? It's not in position 4? Actually, we don't know but we are allowed because we haven't tried position 3 for N? And similarly, E is at position 5? But wait, we have feedback that E is not in position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5? Because we know that E is in the word but not at position 5? Actually, we can put E at position 5? The feedback for the first guess said E was present but not at position 5? That doesn't mean E cannot be at position 5 in the secret word? Wait, no: it means that in the secret word, E is not at position 5? If E were at position 5, the first guess would have shown ✓ for position 5? So we know E is not at position 5? Therefore, we cannot put E at position 5 in any guess? Because it would be wasted? Actually, no: we can put E at position 5 only if we think it might be there? But we know it cannot be? So we must avoid putting E at position 5? Similarly, we must avoid putting R at position 2 and N at position 4.

Therefore, we cannot use E in position 5? So in ""RINSE"", E is at position 5? That would be incorrect because E isn't at position 5? So we shouldn't guess a word that has E at position 5? Similarly, avoid N at position 4 and R at position 2.

Therefore, ""RINSE"" is invalid for E at 5? It's not invalid but it would give us feedback that if the E is really at 5? But we know it's not? So we would get 'x' for E? But wait: the feedback said E is in the word? So if we put E at 5 and it's not the correct position, we might get '-'? But we already know from the first guess that E is not at position 5? Therefore, putting E at position 5 would be uninformative and wasteful? It's better to avoid.

So let's avoid E at position 5? Same for N at position 4 and R at position 2? So we should not put R at position 2 because we know that's not where it is? Similarly, avoid N at 4 and E at 5? Because we already know those positions are wrong? So we want to put R, N, E in other positions to test if they can be correct.

Now, what about positions? We have 5 positions.

For E: we know not at 5? So E must be at 1,2,3, or 4? Similarly, R must be at 1,3,4,5? But we don't know? Actually, R could be at position 1? Not tried yet? Similar for N? Not at 4, so it can be at 1,2,3,5? So possibilities.

Now, we need to make a word?

Let me think: words that contain R, N, E and two new letters? And avoid C and A.

Common letters: try T, O, I, S, L.

For example: ""IRATE"" has A? but A is absent? So we cannot use A? So ""IRATE"" has A? Avoid words with A or C.

So, words: maybe ""ROUTE""? It doesn't have A or C? But let's check: R, O, U, T, E? It has R and E? But not N? We need to include N as well? Because N is present? We know that N is in the word? So we must include N? Otherwise we don't test it? Actually, we have to? Because we already know R, N, E are in the word? But we want to try different positions? Also, we can use a word that doesn't have N to confirm? No? Wait, no: we know N is present? Because of the first guess? So we must include N? Actually, we don't have to? We can choose any word? But if we choose a word without N, then we waste an opportunity? Or it might give us info about other letters? But we know N is present? So why skip it? We should try to place N? To get its position? Similarly for E and R? So we should make a word that includes R, N, E? So we can get more information? Because we have only 6 guesses?

But we can also use this guess to test if the other letters are present? Actually, including R, N, E in the guess is better? So we can try to pin down their positions? While adding new letters? So we need to cover R,N,E and two more? But we can also have words with fewer? But ideally?

So, given that, let's try to form words with R,N,E and two new letters? Without C or A? And with the constraints on positions.

Consider: R cannot be at 2? N cannot be at 4? E cannot be at 5?

So, possible placements:

For E: must go to positions 1,2,3,4? But we don't know? We can put E at 1? That might be tested? Similarly, for R: not at 2? So positions 1,3,4,5? For N: not at 4? So positions 1,2,3,5?

Now, let's find words:

One idea: ""REIGN"": 
- R at1, E at2, I at3, G at4, N at5? 
But check positions: 
- R: at1? Not at2? That's okay? 
- E: at2? We don't know if E is at2? 
- N: at5? That is okay? Because N cannot be at4? So 5 is fine? 
But E: we know E is not at5? But position2 might be okay? 

But we also get I and G? New letters? 

Another idea: ""ROUSE""? But it doesn't have N? 

We need a word with R, N, E? 

How about ""RENEW"": 
But it's 5 letters? R,E,N,E,W? Wait, E repeated? But we don't know if there are repeated E? But currently we don't know? So we can try? 

But positions: 
1:R, 2:E, 3:N, 4:E, 5:W? 
Constraints: 
- R not at2? Okay? At1. 
- E at position2? We don't know? We can try? 
- N at position3? Not at4? 
- E at position4? 
- W at5? 

But E has two positions? It might be that the secret word has only one E? We don't know? 

But the feedback didn't say anything about multiple E? So possible? Also, we avoid A and C? 

But let me think: maybe ""INNER""? But it has two N? 

Perhaps ""LINER"": 
L,I,N,E,R? 
Positions: 
1:L, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:R? 
Now, let's check constraints: 
- R: at position5? Not at2? Good? 
- E: at position4? Not at5? Good? 
- N: at position3? Not at4? Good? 

Also, new letters L and I? 

And it doesn't have C or A? 

""LINER"" seems good? 

But note: in the secret word, we have R at position5? We don't know? Similarly, E at4? 

Now, what are common words? It might be a candidate? 

Another candidate: ""MINER""? M,I,N,E,R? Positions: M at1, I at2, N at3, E at4, R at5? Same as ""LINER""? 

But L or M? Both common? 

But ""LINER"" is a word? Yes.

We can also try ""INTER"": 
I,N,T,E,R? 
Positions: 
1:I,2:N,3:T,4:E,5:R? 
But N at position2? That might be okay? But wait: we know N is not at position4? But position2 is new? Similarly? 
But if we put N at2? Will that work? We don't know? 

But let's compare: 
""INTER"": has T? 

Both are acceptable? 

But also note: in ""LINER"", the R is at5? Which is a new position? Similarly in ""INTER"", R at5? 

But we also have E at4? 

Perhaps we should choose a word where the known letters are placed in positions we haven't tested? 

We haven't tested position1? We placed C,R,A,N,E? So positions: 
- C at1: absent? So letter1 is not C? 
- R at2? Present but wrong? 
- A at3? Absent? So letter3 is not A? But we don't know about other letters? 

Also, E at position5? Wrong? 

So for positions? We know:
Position1: cannot be C? Must be R,N,E? or another letter? But we don't know? We know R is present? So position1 could be R? 

Similarly, position3 cannot be A? So it can be R,N,E? or another? 

So let's consider ""LINER"": 
- Position1: L? New?
- Position2: I? New? But original position2 was R? But we know R was at2 and wrong? So I might be okay? 
- Position3: N? In the first guess N was at position4 and wrong? Now we put at position3? Which is new? 
- Position4: E? First guess E at5? Now at4? Different? 
- Position5: R? First guess R at2? Now at5? 

So all positions for the known letters are new? 

Similarly, ""MINER"" same? 

But we also have to think of commonality? 

Perhaps ""RENAL""? But renal has A? which we know is absent? 

No A? 

Another: ""URINE""? 
U,R,I,N,E? 
Positions: 
1:U, 2:R? Wait, but we know R cannot be at position2? From feedback? So if we put R at position2, we know it will be '-'? Because it's present but wrong position? We might not get new information? It's better to not put known letters in positions we know they cannot be? To get new positions? 

So putting R at position2 again would be pointless? Similarly, N at position4 or E at position5? 

Therefore, we should avoid R at position2, N at position4, and E at position5? 

So ""LINER"": 
- R is at5? Not position2? Okay? 
- N is at3? Not position4? Okay? 
- E is at4? Not position5? Okay? 

Also we test L and I? 

Similarly, ""MINER"": M at1, I at2, N at3, E at4, R at5? Okay? 

Both are words? 

How about ""CRONE""? But C is absent? So cannot have C? 

So no? 

Another: ""STERN""? 
S,T,E,R,N? 
Positions:
1:S,2:T,3:E,4:R,5:N? 
Now, R: at4? Not at2? Okay? 
E: at3? Not at5? Okay? 
N: at5? Not at4? Okay? 
And S and T? 

Also no A or C? 

So ""STERN"" is also good? 

Let me think: which word gives more coverage? 

""LINER"": L and I? 
""MINER"": M and I? 
""STERN"": S and T? 

S and T are very common? So ""STERN"" might be better? 

Also, note: E at position3? It hasn't been tried? 

Similarly? 

Another option: ""PRONE""? 
P,R,O,N,E? 
1:P,2:R? Wait, R at position2? But we know R is not at position2? So this would give '-' for R? Which we already know? And thus we don't get new info? So we avoid? 

Similarly, we must avoid? 

Therefore, choose a word where R is not put in 2? Etc. 

Now, ""STERN"" seems good? It has R at position4? 

But also, N at position5? 

Is ""STERN"" a word? Yes. 

Let me also consider: we don't know if the word is plural? But it's okay? 

So I think ""stern"" is a reasonable choice? 

Alternatively, ""MINER"": 
We know the letter M? 

But both? 

Perhaps ""STERN"" covers S and T? Which are common? 

So let's choose ""STERN""? 

But wait: what about ""LINER""? 

Actually, both are fine? 

Another idea: we can select a word that uses the present letters and tests positions? 

But both seem okay? 

I think I will go with ""STERN""? 

But note: ""STERN"" does not conflict? 

So second guess: ""STERN""?
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C and A are absent (x), so we avoid these letters.
- R, N, and E are present (-) but not in positions 2, 4, or 5, respectively.

For the second guess, we need a word that:
- Does not include C or A.
- Includes R, N, and E.
- Places R not in position 2, N not in position 4, and E not in position 5.
- Tests new common letters (like S and T) to maximize information.

""stern"" meets these criteria:
- S (new letter) at position 1.
- T (new letter) at position 2.
- E at position 3 (previously untried position for E).
- R at position 4 (avoiding position 2).
- N at position 5 (avoiding position 4).

This guess helps test the positions of E, R, and N while introducing S and T for broader coverage.

<guess>stern</guess>",stern,"We are given feedback for our first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains R, N, and E, but not in the positions we guessed (positions 2, 4, and 5 respectively).
- The letters C and A are not in the word.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not include C or A (since they are absent).
- Includes R, N, E, but in different positions than in ""crane"".
- Also, we want to cover more letters to get more information.

Recall the positions in ""crane"":
1. C (x) -> absent
2. R (-) -> present, but not in position 2
3. A (x) -> absent
4. N (-) -> present, but not in position 4
5. E (-) -> present, but not in position 5

Therefore, in the next guess:
- We must avoid using C and A.
- We must include R, N, and E, but not in positions 2, 4, or 5? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us they are never in those positions, only that in this guess they weren't correct. However, since we know R is in the word but not in position 2, we should avoid putting R in position 2 again. Similarly, avoid N in position 4 and E in position 5? Actually, we might try them in other positions? No: For example, the R could be in a different position, but we don't know if it might be in position 1, 3, etc. But we know it's not at position 2. Similarly, we know N is not at 4, and E is not at 5.

But note: We don't know if R can be at position 1 or 3, etc., so we can try R in a new position? Actually, we can.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Given that we know R, N, E are present, and we have three letters to place, we should try to make a word that includes R, N, E and two new letters.

We also know that the word does not contain C and A.

Let's think of common letters: besides R, N, E, we have T, O, I, S, L, etc.

We should avoid repeating the same positions for R, N, E.

So for R: since it was in position 2 and is wrong, we can try it in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 5 might be E's? Wait, we don't know.

We know E cannot be at position 5 (from the feedback) but R could be at position 5? Possibly.

But we also know E is in the word, so we need to place E in position 1,2,3, or 4? Similarly, N must be in position 1,2,3, or 5? Because it cannot be in position 4? Wait, no: the feedback only says that in our guess, the N was in position 4 and that was wrong. But in the secret word, N can be anywhere except position 4? No, the feedback doesn't say that N cannot be at position 4. Let me clarify:

The feedback symbol '-' for a letter means that the letter is in the word but not in that position. So:
- R is in the word, but not in position 2.
- N is in the word, but not in position 4.
- E is in the word, but not in position 5.

It does not say anything about other positions. So R could be at 1,3,4, or 5? But note that if we put R in position 4, that might be possible because originally R was in position 2 and was wrong, and we have no info about position 4 for R? Similarly for N: we know it isn't at 4, so it can be at 1,2,3,5? And E isn't at 5, so it can be at 1,2,3,4.

So in the next guess, we can try R at a position that is not 2, N not at 4, E not at 5.

We also want to cover new letters.

Let's try to pick a word that has R, N, E and two new letters, such that:
- R is not at position 2
- N is not at position 4
- E is not at position 5

Additionally, we should try to avoid the absent letters (C and A).

Let me think of words: 

We could try putting R at position 1? Then N and E in other positions.

Example words: 
- R? N? E?

But also we want to cover new consonants/vowels.

Common words: since we have R, N, E, we can try to form words like ""RINSE"", ""RENEW"", etc. But ""RINSE"": let's see positions.

If we try ""RINSE"":
- R at position 1
- I at position 2 (new letter)
- N at position 3 (which is okay because we know N can be at 3? It's not in position 4? Actually, we don't know but we are allowed because we haven't tried position 3 for N? And similarly, E is at position 5? But wait, we have feedback that E is not in position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5? Because we know that E is in the word but not at position 5? Actually, we can put E at position 5? The feedback for the first guess said E was present but not at position 5? That doesn't mean E cannot be at position 5 in the secret word? Wait, no: it means that in the secret word, E is not at position 5? If E were at position 5, the first guess would have shown ✓ for position 5? So we know E is not at position 5? Therefore, we cannot put E at position 5 in any guess? Because it would be wasted? Actually, no: we can put E at position 5 only if we think it might be there? But we know it cannot be? So we must avoid putting E at position 5? Similarly, we must avoid putting R at position 2 and N at position 4.

Therefore, we cannot use E in position 5? So in ""RINSE"", E is at position 5? That would be incorrect because E isn't at position 5? So we shouldn't guess a word that has E at position 5? Similarly, avoid N at position 4 and R at position 2.

Therefore, ""RINSE"" is invalid for E at 5? It's not invalid but it would give us feedback that if the E is really at 5? But we know it's not? So we would get 'x' for E? But wait: the feedback said E is in the word? So if we put E at 5 and it's not the correct position, we might get '-'? But we already know from the first guess that E is not at position 5? Therefore, putting E at position 5 would be uninformative and wasteful? It's better to avoid.

So let's avoid E at position 5? Same for N at position 4 and R at position 2? So we should not put R at position 2 because we know that's not where it is? Similarly, avoid N at 4 and E at 5? Because we already know those positions are wrong? So we want to put R, N, E in other positions to test if they can be correct.

Now, what about positions? We have 5 positions.

For E: we know not at 5? So E must be at 1,2,3, or 4? Similarly, R must be at 1,3,4,5? But we don't know? Actually, R could be at position 1? Not tried yet? Similar for N? Not at 4, so it can be at 1,2,3,5? So possibilities.

Now, we need to make a word?

Let me think: words that contain R, N, E and two new letters? And avoid C and A.

Common letters: try T, O, I, S, L.

For example: ""IRATE"" has A? but A is absent? So we cannot use A? So ""IRATE"" has A? Avoid words with A or C.

So, words: maybe ""ROUTE""? It doesn't have A or C? But let's check: R, O, U, T, E? It has R and E? But not N? We need to include N as well? Because N is present? We know that N is in the word? So we must include N? Otherwise we don't test it? Actually, we have to? Because we already know R, N, E are in the word? But we want to try different positions? Also, we can use a word that doesn't have N to confirm? No? Wait, no: we know N is present? Because of the first guess? So we must include N? Actually, we don't have to? We can choose any word? But if we choose a word without N, then we waste an opportunity? Or it might give us info about other letters? But we know N is present? So why skip it? We should try to place N? To get its position? Similarly for E and R? So we should make a word that includes R, N, E? So we can get more information? Because we have only 6 guesses?

But we can also use this guess to test if the other letters are present? Actually, including R, N, E in the guess is better? So we can try to pin down their positions? While adding new letters? So we need to cover R,N,E and two more? But we can also have words with fewer? But ideally?

So, given that, let's try to form words with R,N,E and two new letters? Without C or A? And with the constraints on positions.

Consider: R cannot be at 2? N cannot be at 4? E cannot be at 5?

So, possible placements:

For E: must go to positions 1,2,3,4? But we don't know? We can put E at 1? That might be tested? Similarly, for R: not at 2? So positions 1,3,4,5? For N: not at 4? So positions 1,2,3,5?

Now, let's find words:

One idea: ""REIGN"": 
- R at1, E at2, I at3, G at4, N at5? 
But check positions: 
- R: at1? Not at2? That's okay? 
- E: at2? We don't know if E is at2? 
- N: at5? That is okay? Because N cannot be at4? So 5 is fine? 
But E: we know E is not at5? But position2 might be okay? 

But we also get I and G? New letters? 

Another idea: ""ROUSE""? But it doesn't have N? 

We need a word with R, N, E? 

How about ""RENEW"": 
But it's 5 letters? R,E,N,E,W? Wait, E repeated? But we don't know if there are repeated E? But currently we don't know? So we can try? 

But positions: 
1:R, 2:E, 3:N, 4:E, 5:W? 
Constraints: 
- R not at2? Okay? At1. 
- E at position2? We don't know? We can try? 
- N at position3? Not at4? 
- E at position4? 
- W at5? 

But E has two positions? It might be that the secret word has only one E? We don't know? 

But the feedback didn't say anything about multiple E? So possible? Also, we avoid A and C? 

But let me think: maybe ""INNER""? But it has two N? 

Perhaps ""LINER"": 
L,I,N,E,R? 
Positions: 
1:L, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:R? 
Now, let's check constraints: 
- R: at position5? Not at2? Good? 
- E: at position4? Not at5? Good? 
- N: at position3? Not at4? Good? 

Also, new letters L and I? 

And it doesn't have C or A? 

""LINER"" seems good? 

But note: in the secret word, we have R at position5? We don't know? Similarly, E at4? 

Now, what are common words? It might be a candidate? 

Another candidate: ""MINER""? M,I,N,E,R? Positions: M at1, I at2, N at3, E at4, R at5? Same as ""LINER""? 

But L or M? Both common? 

But ""LINER"" is a word? Yes.

We can also try ""INTER"": 
I,N,T,E,R? 
Positions: 
1:I,2:N,3:T,4:E,5:R? 
But N at position2? That might be okay? But wait: we know N is not at position4? But position2 is new? Similarly? 
But if we put N at2? Will that work? We don't know? 

But let's compare: 
""INTER"": has T? 

Both are acceptable? 

But also note: in ""LINER"", the R is at5? Which is a new position? Similarly in ""INTER"", R at5? 

But we also have E at4? 

Perhaps we should choose a word where the known letters are placed in positions we haven't tested? 

We haven't tested position1? We placed C,R,A,N,E? So positions: 
- C at1: absent? So letter1 is not C? 
- R at2? Present but wrong? 
- A at3? Absent? So letter3 is not A? But we don't know about other letters? 

Also, E at position5? Wrong? 

So for positions? We know:
Position1: cannot be C? Must be R,N,E? or another letter? But we don't know? We know R is present? So position1 could be R? 

Similarly, position3 cannot be A? So it can be R,N,E? or another? 

So let's consider ""LINER"": 
- Position1: L? New?
- Position2: I? New? But original position2 was R? But we know R was at2 and wrong? So I might be okay? 
- Position3: N? In the first guess N was at position4 and wrong? Now we put at position3? Which is new? 
- Position4: E? First guess E at5? Now at4? Different? 
- Position5: R? First guess R at2? Now at5? 

So all positions for the known letters are new? 

Similarly, ""MINER"" same? 

But we also have to think of commonality? 

Perhaps ""RENAL""? But renal has A? which we know is absent? 

No A? 

Another: ""URINE""? 
U,R,I,N,E? 
Positions: 
1:U, 2:R? Wait, but we know R cannot be at position2? From feedback? So if we put R at position2, we know it will be '-'? Because it's present but wrong position? We might not get new information? It's better to not put known letters in positions we know they cannot be? To get new positions? 

So putting R at position2 again would be pointless? Similarly, N at position4 or E at position5? 

Therefore, we should avoid R at position2, N at position4, and E at position5? 

So ""LINER"": 
- R is at5? Not position2? Okay? 
- N is at3? Not position4? Okay? 
- E is at4? Not position5? Okay? 

Also we test L and I? 

Similarly, ""MINER"": M at1, I at2, N at3, E at4, R at5? Okay? 

Both are words? 

How about ""CRONE""? But C is absent? So cannot have C? 

So no? 

Another: ""STERN""? 
S,T,E,R,N? 
Positions:
1:S,2:T,3:E,4:R,5:N? 
Now, R: at4? Not at2? Okay? 
E: at3? Not at5? Okay? 
N: at5? Not at4? Okay? 
And S and T? 

Also no A or C? 

So ""STERN"" is also good? 

Let me think: which word gives more coverage? 

""LINER"": L and I? 
""MINER"": M and I? 
""STERN"": S and T? 

S and T are very common? So ""STERN"" might be better? 

Also, note: E at position3? It hasn't been tried? 

Similarly? 

Another option: ""PRONE""? 
P,R,O,N,E? 
1:P,2:R? Wait, R at position2? But we know R is not at position2? So this would give '-' for R? Which we already know? And thus we don't get new info? So we avoid? 

Similarly, we must avoid? 

Therefore, choose a word where R is not put in 2? Etc. 

Now, ""STERN"" seems good? It has R at position4? 

But also, N at position5? 

Is ""STERN"" a word? Yes. 

Let me also consider: we don't know if the word is plural? But it's okay? 

So I think ""stern"" is a reasonable choice? 

Alternatively, ""MINER"": 
We know the letter M? 

But both? 

Perhaps ""STERN"" covers S and T? Which are common? 

So let's choose ""STERN""? 

But wait: what about ""LINER""? 

Actually, both are fine? 

Another idea: we can select a word that uses the present letters and tests positions? 

But both seem okay? 

I think I will go with ""STERN""? 

But note: ""STERN"" does not conflict? 

So second guess: ""STERN""?Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C and A are absent (x), so we avoid these letters.
- R, N, and E are present (-) but not in positions 2, 4, or 5, respectively.

For the second guess, we need a word that:
- Does not include C or A.
- Includes R, N, and E.
- Places R not in position 2, N not in position 4, and E not in position 5.
- Tests new common letters (like S and T) to maximize information.

""stern"" meets these criteria:
- S (new letter) at position 1.
- T (new letter) at position 2.
- E at position 3 (previously untried position for E).
- R at position 4 (avoiding position 2).
- N at position 5 (avoiding position 4).

This guess helps test the positions of E, R, and N while introducing S and T for broader coverage.",Guess 2: stern -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) E(-) R(-) N(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,tenor,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are all frequent in English words.

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for our first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains R, N, and E, but not in the positions we guessed (positions 2, 4, and 5 respectively).
- The letters C and A are not in the word.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not include C or A (since they are absent).
- Includes R, N, E, but in different positions than in ""crane"".
- Also, we want to cover more letters to get more information.

Recall the positions in ""crane"":
1. C (x) -> absent
2. R (-) -> present, but not in position 2
3. A (x) -> absent
4. N (-) -> present, but not in position 4
5. E (-) -> present, but not in position 5

Therefore, in the next guess:
- We must avoid using C and A.
- We must include R, N, and E, but not in positions 2, 4, or 5? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us they are never in those positions, only that in this guess they weren't correct. However, since we know R is in the word but not in position 2, we should avoid putting R in position 2 again. Similarly, avoid N in position 4 and E in position 5? Actually, we might try them in other positions? No: For example, the R could be in a different position, but we don't know if it might be in position 1, 3, etc. But we know it's not at position 2. Similarly, we know N is not at 4, and E is not at 5.

But note: We don't know if R can be at position 1 or 3, etc., so we can try R in a new position? Actually, we can.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Given that we know R, N, E are present, and we have three letters to place, we should try to make a word that includes R, N, E and two new letters.

We also know that the word does not contain C and A.

Let's think of common letters: besides R, N, E, we have T, O, I, S, L, etc.

We should avoid repeating the same positions for R, N, E.

So for R: since it was in position 2 and is wrong, we can try it in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 5 might be E's? Wait, we don't know.

We know E cannot be at position 5 (from the feedback) but R could be at position 5? Possibly.

But we also know E is in the word, so we need to place E in position 1,2,3, or 4? Similarly, N must be in position 1,2,3, or 5? Because it cannot be in position 4? Wait, no: the feedback only says that in our guess, the N was in position 4 and that was wrong. But in the secret word, N can be anywhere except position 4? No, the feedback doesn't say that N cannot be at position 4. Let me clarify:

The feedback symbol '-' for a letter means that the letter is in the word but not in that position. So:
- R is in the word, but not in position 2.
- N is in the word, but not in position 4.
- E is in the word, but not in position 5.

It does not say anything about other positions. So R could be at 1,3,4, or 5? But note that if we put R in position 4, that might be possible because originally R was in position 2 and was wrong, and we have no info about position 4 for R? Similarly for N: we know it isn't at 4, so it can be at 1,2,3,5? And E isn't at 5, so it can be at 1,2,3,4.

So in the next guess, we can try R at a position that is not 2, N not at 4, E not at 5.

We also want to cover new letters.

Let's try to pick a word that has R, N, E and two new letters, such that:
- R is not at position 2
- N is not at position 4
- E is not at position 5

Additionally, we should try to avoid the absent letters (C and A).

Let me think of words: 

We could try putting R at position 1? Then N and E in other positions.

Example words: 
- R? N? E?

But also we want to cover new consonants/vowels.

Common words: since we have R, N, E, we can try to form words like ""RINSE"", ""RENEW"", etc. But ""RINSE"": let's see positions.

If we try ""RINSE"":
- R at position 1
- I at position 2 (new letter)
- N at position 3 (which is okay because we know N can be at 3? It's not in position 4? Actually, we don't know but we are allowed because we haven't tried position 3 for N? And similarly, E is at position 5? But wait, we have feedback that E is not in position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5? Because we know that E is in the word but not at position 5? Actually, we can put E at position 5? The feedback for the first guess said E was present but not at position 5? That doesn't mean E cannot be at position 5 in the secret word? Wait, no: it means that in the secret word, E is not at position 5? If E were at position 5, the first guess would have shown ✓ for position 5? So we know E is not at position 5? Therefore, we cannot put E at position 5 in any guess? Because it would be wasted? Actually, no: we can put E at position 5 only if we think it might be there? But we know it cannot be? So we must avoid putting E at position 5? Similarly, we must avoid putting R at position 2 and N at position 4.

Therefore, we cannot use E in position 5? So in ""RINSE"", E is at position 5? That would be incorrect because E isn't at position 5? So we shouldn't guess a word that has E at position 5? Similarly, avoid N at position 4 and R at position 2.

Therefore, ""RINSE"" is invalid for E at 5? It's not invalid but it would give us feedback that if the E is really at 5? But we know it's not? So we would get 'x' for E? But wait: the feedback said E is in the word? So if we put E at 5 and it's not the correct position, we might get '-'? But we already know from the first guess that E is not at position 5? Therefore, putting E at position 5 would be uninformative and wasteful? It's better to avoid.

So let's avoid E at position 5? Same for N at position 4 and R at position 2? So we should not put R at position 2 because we know that's not where it is? Similarly, avoid N at 4 and E at 5? Because we already know those positions are wrong? So we want to put R, N, E in other positions to test if they can be correct.

Now, what about positions? We have 5 positions.

For E: we know not at 5? So E must be at 1,2,3, or 4? Similarly, R must be at 1,3,4,5? But we don't know? Actually, R could be at position 1? Not tried yet? Similar for N? Not at 4, so it can be at 1,2,3,5? So possibilities.

Now, we need to make a word?

Let me think: words that contain R, N, E and two new letters? And avoid C and A.

Common letters: try T, O, I, S, L.

For example: ""IRATE"" has A? but A is absent? So we cannot use A? So ""IRATE"" has A? Avoid words with A or C.

So, words: maybe ""ROUTE""? It doesn't have A or C? But let's check: R, O, U, T, E? It has R and E? But not N? We need to include N as well? Because N is present? We know that N is in the word? So we must include N? Otherwise we don't test it? Actually, we have to? Because we already know R, N, E are in the word? But we want to try different positions? Also, we can use a word that doesn't have N to confirm? No? Wait, no: we know N is present? Because of the first guess? So we must include N? Actually, we don't have to? We can choose any word? But if we choose a word without N, then we waste an opportunity? Or it might give us info about other letters? But we know N is present? So why skip it? We should try to place N? To get its position? Similarly for E and R? So we should make a word that includes R, N, E? So we can get more information? Because we have only 6 guesses?

But we can also use this guess to test if the other letters are present? Actually, including R, N, E in the guess is better? So we can try to pin down their positions? While adding new letters? So we need to cover R,N,E and two more? But we can also have words with fewer? But ideally?

So, given that, let's try to form words with R,N,E and two new letters? Without C or A? And with the constraints on positions.

Consider: R cannot be at 2? N cannot be at 4? E cannot be at 5?

So, possible placements:

For E: must go to positions 1,2,3,4? But we don't know? We can put E at 1? That might be tested? Similarly, for R: not at 2? So positions 1,3,4,5? For N: not at 4? So positions 1,2,3,5?

Now, let's find words:

One idea: ""REIGN"": 
- R at1, E at2, I at3, G at4, N at5? 
But check positions: 
- R: at1? Not at2? That's okay? 
- E: at2? We don't know if E is at2? 
- N: at5? That is okay? Because N cannot be at4? So 5 is fine? 
But E: we know E is not at5? But position2 might be okay? 

But we also get I and G? New letters? 

Another idea: ""ROUSE""? But it doesn't have N? 

We need a word with R, N, E? 

How about ""RENEW"": 
But it's 5 letters? R,E,N,E,W? Wait, E repeated? But we don't know if there are repeated E? But currently we don't know? So we can try? 

But positions: 
1:R, 2:E, 3:N, 4:E, 5:W? 
Constraints: 
- R not at2? Okay? At1. 
- E at position2? We don't know? We can try? 
- N at position3? Not at4? 
- E at position4? 
- W at5? 

But E has two positions? It might be that the secret word has only one E? We don't know? 

But the feedback didn't say anything about multiple E? So possible? Also, we avoid A and C? 

But let me think: maybe ""INNER""? But it has two N? 

Perhaps ""LINER"": 
L,I,N,E,R? 
Positions: 
1:L, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:R? 
Now, let's check constraints: 
- R: at position5? Not at2? Good? 
- E: at position4? Not at5? Good? 
- N: at position3? Not at4? Good? 

Also, new letters L and I? 

And it doesn't have C or A? 

""LINER"" seems good? 

But note: in the secret word, we have R at position5? We don't know? Similarly, E at4? 

Now, what are common words? It might be a candidate? 

Another candidate: ""MINER""? M,I,N,E,R? Positions: M at1, I at2, N at3, E at4, R at5? Same as ""LINER""? 

But L or M? Both common? 

But ""LINER"" is a word? Yes.

We can also try ""INTER"": 
I,N,T,E,R? 
Positions: 
1:I,2:N,3:T,4:E,5:R? 
But N at position2? That might be okay? But wait: we know N is not at position4? But position2 is new? Similarly? 
But if we put N at2? Will that work? We don't know? 

But let's compare: 
""INTER"": has T? 

Both are acceptable? 

But also note: in ""LINER"", the R is at5? Which is a new position? Similarly in ""INTER"", R at5? 

But we also have E at4? 

Perhaps we should choose a word where the known letters are placed in positions we haven't tested? 

We haven't tested position1? We placed C,R,A,N,E? So positions: 
- C at1: absent? So letter1 is not C? 
- R at2? Present but wrong? 
- A at3? Absent? So letter3 is not A? But we don't know about other letters? 

Also, E at position5? Wrong? 

So for positions? We know:
Position1: cannot be C? Must be R,N,E? or another letter? But we don't know? We know R is present? So position1 could be R? 

Similarly, position3 cannot be A? So it can be R,N,E? or another? 

So let's consider ""LINER"": 
- Position1: L? New?
- Position2: I? New? But original position2 was R? But we know R was at2 and wrong? So I might be okay? 
- Position3: N? In the first guess N was at position4 and wrong? Now we put at position3? Which is new? 
- Position4: E? First guess E at5? Now at4? Different? 
- Position5: R? First guess R at2? Now at5? 

So all positions for the known letters are new? 

Similarly, ""MINER"" same? 

But we also have to think of commonality? 

Perhaps ""RENAL""? But renal has A? which we know is absent? 

No A? 

Another: ""URINE""? 
U,R,I,N,E? 
Positions: 
1:U, 2:R? Wait, but we know R cannot be at position2? From feedback? So if we put R at position2, we know it will be '-'? Because it's present but wrong position? We might not get new information? It's better to not put known letters in positions we know they cannot be? To get new positions? 

So putting R at position2 again would be pointless? Similarly, N at position4 or E at position5? 

Therefore, we should avoid R at position2, N at position4, and E at position5? 

So ""LINER"": 
- R is at5? Not position2? Okay? 
- N is at3? Not position4? Okay? 
- E is at4? Not position5? Okay? 

Also we test L and I? 

Similarly, ""MINER"": M at1, I at2, N at3, E at4, R at5? Okay? 

Both are words? 

How about ""CRONE""? But C is absent? So cannot have C? 

So no? 

Another: ""STERN""? 
S,T,E,R,N? 
Positions:
1:S,2:T,3:E,4:R,5:N? 
Now, R: at4? Not at2? Okay? 
E: at3? Not at5? Okay? 
N: at5? Not at4? Okay? 
And S and T? 

Also no A or C? 

So ""STERN"" is also good? 

Let me think: which word gives more coverage? 

""LINER"": L and I? 
""MINER"": M and I? 
""STERN"": S and T? 

S and T are very common? So ""STERN"" might be better? 

Also, note: E at position3? It hasn't been tried? 

Similarly? 

Another option: ""PRONE""? 
P,R,O,N,E? 
1:P,2:R? Wait, R at position2? But we know R is not at position2? So this would give '-' for R? Which we already know? And thus we don't get new info? So we avoid? 

Similarly, we must avoid? 

Therefore, choose a word where R is not put in 2? Etc. 

Now, ""STERN"" seems good? It has R at position4? 

But also, N at position5? 

Is ""STERN"" a word? Yes. 

Let me also consider: we don't know if the word is plural? But it's okay? 

So I think ""stern"" is a reasonable choice? 

Alternatively, ""MINER"": 
We know the letter M? 

But both? 

Perhaps ""STERN"" covers S and T? Which are common? 

So let's choose ""STERN""? 

But wait: what about ""LINER""? 

Actually, both are fine? 

Another idea: we can select a word that uses the present letters and tests positions? 

But both seem okay? 

I think I will go with ""STERN""? 

But note: ""STERN"" does not conflict? 

So second guess: ""STERN""?Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C and A are absent (x), so we avoid these letters.
- R, N, and E are present (-) but not in positions 2, 4, or 5, respectively.

For the second guess, we need a word that:
- Does not include C or A.
- Includes R, N, and E.
- Places R not in position 2, N not in position 4, and E not in position 5.
- Tests new common letters (like S and T) to maximize information.

""stern"" meets these criteria:
- S (new letter) at position 1.
- T (new letter) at position 2.
- E at position 3 (previously untried position for E).
- R at position 4 (avoiding position 2).
- N at position 5 (avoiding position 4).

This guess helps test the positions of E, R, and N while introducing S and T for broader coverage.

We should choose a word that:\n- Does not include C or A (since they are absent).\n- Includes R, N, E, but in different positions than in ""crane"".\n- Also, we want to cover more letters to get more information.\n\nRecall the positions in ""crane"":\n1.

E (-) -> present, but not in position 5\n\nTherefore, in the next guess:\n- We must avoid using C and A.\n- We must include R, N, and E, but not in positions 2, 4, or 5? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us they are never in those positions, only that in this guess they weren\'t correct. However, since we know R is in the word but not in position 2, we should avoid putting R in position 2 again. Similarly, avoid N in position 4 and E in position 5? Actually, we might try them in other positions? No: For example, the R could be in a different position, but we don\'t know if it might be in position 1, 3, etc. But we know it\'s not at position 2. Similarly, we know N is not at 4, and E is not at 5.\n\nBut note: We don\'t know if R can be at position 1 or 3, etc., so we can try R in a new position? Actually, we can.\n\nWe also want to test other common letters to get more information.\n\nGiven that we know R, N, E are present, and we have three letters to place, we should try to make a word that includes R, N, E and two new letters.\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain C and A.\n\nLet\'s think of common letters: besides R, N, E, we have T, O, I, S, L, etc.\n\nWe should avoid repeating the same positions for R, N, E.\n\nSo for R: since it was in position 2 and is wrong, we can try it in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 5 might be E\'s? Wait, we don\'t know.\n\nWe know E cannot be at position 5 (from the feedback) but R could be at position 5? Possibly.\n\nBut we also know E is in the word, so we need to place E in position 1,2,3, or 4? Similarly, N must be in position 1,2,3, or 5? Because it cannot be in position 4? Wait, no: the feedback only says that in our guess, the N was in position 4 and that was wrong. But in the secret word, N can be anywhere except position 4? No, the feedback doesn\'t say that N cannot be at position 4. Let me clarify:\n\nThe feedback symbol \'-\' for a letter means that the letter is in the word but not in that position. So:\n- R is in the word, but not in position 2.\n- N is in the word, but not in position 4.\n- E is in the word, but not in position 5.\n\nIt does not say anything about other positions. So R could be at 1,3,4, or 5? But note that if we put R in position 4, that might be possible because originally R was in position 2 and was wrong, and we have no info about position 4 for R? Similarly for N: we know it isn\'t at 4, so it can be at 1,2,3,5? And E isn\'t at 5, so it can be at 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo in the next guess, we can try R at a position that is not 2, N not at 4, E not at 5.\n\nWe also want to cover new letters.\n\nLet\'s try to pick a word that has R, N, E and two new letters, such that:\n- R is not at position 2\n- N is not at position 4\n- E is not at position 5\n\nAdditionally, we should try to avoid the absent letters (C and A).\n\nLet me think of words: \n\nWe could try putting R at position 1? Then N and E in other positions.\n\nExample words: \n- R? N? E?\n\nBut also we want to cover new consonants/vowels.\n\nCommon words: since we have R, N, E, we can try to form words like ""RINSE"", ""RENEW"", etc. But ""RINSE"": let\'s see positions.\n\nIf we try ""RINSE"":\n- R at position 1\n- I at position 2 (new letter)\n- N at position 3 (which is okay because we know N can be at 3? It\'s not in position 4? Actually, we don\'t know but we are allowed because we haven\'t tried position 3 for N? And similarly, E is at position 5? But wait, we have feedback that E is not in position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5? Because we know that E is in the word but not at position 5? Actually, we can put E at position 5? The feedback for the first guess said E was present but not at position 5? That doesn\'t mean E cannot be at position 5 in the secret word? Wait, no: it means that in the secret word, E is not at position 5? If E were at position 5, the first guess would have shown ✓ for position 5? So we know E is not at position 5? Therefore, we cannot put E at position 5 in any guess? Because it would be wasted? Actually, no: we can put E at position 5 only if we think it might be there? But we know it cannot be? So we must avoid putting E at position 5? Similarly, we must avoid putting R at position 2 and N at position 4.\n\nTherefore, we cannot use E in position 5? So in ""RINSE"", E is at position 5? That would be incorrect because E isn\'t at position 5? So we shouldn\'t guess a word that has E at position 5? Similarly, avoid N at position 4 and R at position 2.\n\nTherefore, ""RINSE"" is invalid for E at 5? It\'s not invalid but it would give us feedback that if the E is really at 5? But we know it\'s not? So we would get \'x\' for E? But wait: the feedback said E is in the word? So if we put E at 5 and it\'s not the correct position, we might get \'-\'? But we already know from the first guess that E is not at position 5? Therefore, putting E at position 5 would be uninformative and wasteful? It\'s better to avoid.\n\nSo let\'s avoid E at position 5? Same for N at position 4 and R at position 2? So we should not put R at position 2 because we know that\'s not where it is? Similarly, avoid N at 4 and E at 5? Because we already know those positions are wrong? So we want to put R, N, E in other positions to test if they can be correct.\n\nNow, what about positions? We have 5 positions.\n\nFor E: we know not at 5? So E must be at 1,2,3, or 4? Similarly, R must be at 1,3,4,5? But we don\'t know? Actually, R could be at position 1? Not tried yet? Similar for N? Not at 4, so it can be at 1,2,3,5? So possibilities.\n\nNow, we need to make a word?\n\nLet me think: words that contain R, N, E and two new letters? And avoid C and A.\n\nCommon letters: try T, O, I, S, L.\n\nFor example: ""IRATE"" has A? but A is absent? So we cannot use A? So ""IRATE"" has A? Avoid words with A or C.\n\nSo, words: maybe ""ROUTE""? It doesn\'t have A or C? But let\'s check: R, O, U, T, E? It has R and E? But not N? We need to include N as well? Because N is present? We know that N is in the word? So we must include N? Otherwise we don\'t test it? Actually, we have to? Because we already know R, N, E are in the word? But we want to try different positions? Also, we can use a word that doesn\'t have N to confirm? No? Wait, no: we know N is present? Because of the first guess? So we must include N? Actually, we don\'t have to? We can choose any word? But if we choose a word without N, then we waste an opportunity? Or it might give us info about other letters? But we know N is present? So why skip it? We should try to place N? To get its position? Similarly for E and R? So we should make a word that includes R, N, E? So we can get more information? Because we have only 6 guesses?\n\nBut we can also use this guess to test if the other letters are present? Actually, including R, N, E in the guess is better? So we can try to pin down their positions? While adding new letters? So we need to cover R,N,E and two more? But we can also have words with fewer? But ideally?\n\nSo, given that, let\'s try to form words with R,N,E and two new letters? Without C or A? And with the constraints on positions.\n\nConsider: R cannot be at 2? N cannot be at 4? E cannot be at 5?\n\nSo, possible placements:\n\nFor E: must go to positions 1,2,3,4? But we don\'t know? We can put E at 1? That might be tested? Similarly, for R: not at 2? So positions 1,3,4,5? For N: not at 4? So positions 1,2,3,5?\n\nNow, let\'s find words:\n\nOne idea: ""REIGN"": \n- R at1, E at2, I at3, G at4, N at5? \nBut check positions: \n- R: at1? Not at2? That\'s okay? \n- E: at2? We don\'t know if E is at2? \n- N: at5? That is okay? Because N cannot be at4? So 5 is fine? \nBut E: we know E is not at5? But position2 might be okay? \n\nBut we also get I and G? New letters? \n\nAnother idea: ""ROUSE""? But it doesn\'t have N? \n\nWe need a word with R, N, E? \n\nHow about ""RENEW"": \nBut it\'s 5 letters? R,E,N,E,W? Wait, E repeated? But we don\'t know if there are repeated E? But currently we don\'t know? So we can try? \n\nBut positions: \n1:R, 2:E, 3:N, 4:E, 5:W? \nConstraints: \n- R not at2? Okay? At1. \n- E at position2? We don\'t know? We can try? \n- N at position3? Not at4? \n- E at position4? \n- W at5? \n\nBut E has two positions? It might be that the secret word has only one E? We don\'t know? \n\nBut the feedback didn\'t say anything about multiple E? So possible? Also, we avoid A and C? \n\nBut let me think: maybe ""INNER""? But it has two N? \n\nPerhaps ""LINER"": \nL,I,N,E,R? \nPositions: \n1:L, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:R? \nNow, let\'s check constraints: \n- R: at position5? Not at2? Good? \n- E: at position4? Not at5? Good? \n- N: at position3? Not at4? Good? \n\nAlso, new letters L and I? \n\nAnd it doesn\'t have C or A? \n\n""LINER"" seems good? \n\nBut note: in the secret word, we have R at position5? We don\'t know? Similarly, E at4? \n\nNow, what are common words? It might be a candidate? \n\nAnother candidate: ""MINER""? M,I,N,E,R? Positions: M at1, I at2, N at3, E at4, R at5? Same as ""LINER""? \n\nBut L or M? Both common? \n\nBut ""LINER"" is a word? Yes.\n\nWe can also try ""INTER"": \nI,N,T,E,R? \nPositions: \n1:I,2:N,3:T,4:E,5:R? \nBut N at position2? That might be okay? But wait: we know N is not at position4? But position2 is new? Similarly? \nBut if we put N at2? Will that work? We don\'t know? \n\nBut let\'s compare: \n""INTER"": has T? \n\nBoth are acceptable? \n\nBut also note: in ""LINER"", the R is at5? Which is a new position? Similarly in ""INTER"", R at5? \n\nBut we also have E at4? \n\nPerhaps we should choose a word where the known letters are placed in positions we haven\'t tested? \n\nWe haven\'t tested position1? We placed C,R,A,N,E? So positions: \n- C at1: absent? So letter1 is not C? \n- R at2? Present but wrong? \n- A at3? Absent? So letter3 is not A? But we don\'t know about other letters? \n\nAlso, E at position5? Wrong? \n\nSo for positions? We know:\nPosition1: cannot be C? Must be R,N,E? or another letter? But we don\'t know? We know R is present? So position1 could be R? \n\nSimilarly, position3 cannot be A? So it can be R,N,E? or another? \n\nSo let\'s consider ""LINER"": \n- Position1: L? New?\n- Position2: I? New? But original position2 was R? But we know R was at2 and wrong? So I might be okay? \n- Position3: N? In the first guess N was at position4 and wrong? Now we put at position3? Which is new? \n- Position4: E? First guess E at5? Now at4? Different? \n- Position5: R? First guess R at2? Now at5? \n\nSo all positions for the known letters are new? \n\nSimilarly, ""MINER"" same? \n\nBut we also have to think of commonality? \n\nPerhaps ""RENAL""? But renal has A? which we know is absent? \n\nNo A? \n\nAnother: ""URINE""? \nU,R,I,N,E? \nPositions: \n1:U, 2:R? Wait, but we know R cannot be at position2? From feedback? So if we put R at position2, we know it will be \'-\'? Because it\'s present but wrong position? We might not get new information? It\'s better to not put known letters in positions we know they cannot be? To get new positions? \n\nSo putting R at position2 again would be pointless? Similarly, N at position4 or E at position5? \n\nTherefore, we should avoid R at position2, N at position4, and E at position5? \n\nSo ""LINER"": \n- R is at5? Not position2? Okay? \n- N is at3? Not position4? Okay? \n- E is at4? Not position5? Okay? \n\nAlso we test L and I? \n\nSimilarly, ""MINER"": M at1, I at2, N at3, E at4, R at5? Okay? \n\nBoth are words? \n\nHow about ""CRONE""? But C is absent? So cannot have C? \n\nSo no? \n\nAnother: ""STERN""? \nS,T,E,R,N? \nPositions:\n1:S,2:T,3:E,4:R,5:N? \nNow, R: at4? Not at2? Okay? \nE: at3? Not at5? Okay? \nN: at5? Not at4? Okay? \nAnd S and T? \n\nAlso no A or C? \n\nSo ""STERN"" is also good? \n\nLet me think: which word gives more coverage? \n\n""LINER"": L and I? \n""MINER"": M and I? \n""STERN"": S and T? \n\nS and T are very common? So ""STERN"" might be better? \n\nAlso, note: E at position3? It hasn\'t been tried? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nAnother option: ""PRONE""? \nP,R,O,N,E? \n1:P,2:R? Wait, R at position2? But we know R is not at position2? So this would give \'-\' for R? Which we already know? And thus we don\'t get new info? So we avoid? \n\nSimilarly, we must avoid? \n\nTherefore, choose a word where R is not put in 2? Etc. \n\nNow, ""STERN"" seems good? It has R at position4? \n\nBut also, N at position5? \n\nIs ""STERN"" a word? Yes. \n\nLet me also consider: we don\'t know if the word is plural? But it\'s okay? \n\nSo I think ""stern"" is a reasonable choice? \n\nAlternatively, ""MINER"": \nWe know the letter M? \n\nBut both? \n\nPerhaps ""STERN"" covers S and T? Which are common? \n\nSo let\'s choose ""STERN""? \n\nBut wait: what about ""LINER""? \n\nActually, both are fine? \n\nAnother idea: we can select a word that uses the present letters and tests positions? \n\nBut both seem okay? \n\nI think I will go with ""STERN""? \n\nBut note: ""STERN"" does not conflict? \n\nSo second guess: ""STERN""?Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C and A are absent (x), so we avoid these letters.\n- R, N, and E are present (-) but not in positions 2, 4, or 5, respectively.\n\nFor the second guess, we need a word that:\n- Does not include C or A.\n- Includes R, N, and E.\n- Places R not in position 2, N not in position 4, and E not in position 5.\n- Tests new common letters (like S and T) to maximize information.\n\n""stern"" meets these criteria:\n- S (new letter) at position 1.\n- T (new letter) at position 2.\n- E at position 3 (previously untried position for E).\n- R at position 4 (avoiding position 2).\n- N at position 5 (avoiding position 4).\n\nThis guess helps test the positions of E, R, and N while introducing S and T for broader coverage.\n\n<guess>stern</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: stern -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) E(-) R(-) N(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
This tells us:
- C and A are not in the word.
- R, N, and E are in the word but:
  - R is not in position 2.
  - N is not in position 4.
  - E is not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""stern"" -> S(x) T(-) E(-) R(-) N(-)
This tells us:
- S is not in the word.
- T, E, R, and N are in the word but:
  - T is not in position 2 (because we got '-' at position 2? Actually: positions of ""stern"" are: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:R, 5:N).
  Feedback: S(x) at position 1 -> S absent.
            T(-) at position 2 -> T present but not at position 2.
            E(-) at position 3 -> E present but not at position 3.
            R(-) at position 4 -> R present but not at position 4.
            N(-) at position 5 -> N present but not at position 5.

Now we combine what we know:

Absent letters: C, A, S (from both guesses).

Present letters: R, N, E (from first guess) and T (from second guess). Also, we know E is present and now we have two confirmations.

But note: We don't have any letter that is in the correct position yet? All are '-'.

So we have confirmed letters: R, N, E, T are in the word? And from guess1 we also know R,N,E? Now from guess2 we have T? And R,N,E again? So the letters are R, N, E, T and one more? Because it's a 5-letter word? And we have not found the fifth letter? We know S is absent? So we need to find the fifth letter.

The secret word must be composed of: R, N, E, T, and one unknown letter? And must not contain C, A, S? And we have 6 letters? But we have only 4? So one more letter? We don't know? We have known letters: R, N, E, T? Four? So we need one more? How many absent? We have C, A, S absent? But there might be others? We don't know? We need to test more letters.

Also, we have information about the positions? So let's summarize:

Known absent: C, A, S.

Known present: R, N, E, T? And one unknown? Or maybe five? But we have only found four? So one more letter? And we haven't tried many other letters? Like B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? So we need to test one of these? But we know that R, N, E, T are in the word? So the secret word is formed by R, N, E, T and one other letter? Let’s call it X? And we don't know X? So we must find X and the positions? 

But note: From feedback, we know positions that are not allowed:

For R: 
- Not at position 2 (from guess1) and not at position 4 (from guess2)? Because in guess2, position4 R was '-'? So R is not at 2 or 4? So possible positions for R: 1, 3, 5.

Similarly, N:
- Not at position 4 (guess1) and not at position 5 (guess2) because in guess2, position5 N was '-'? Wait: in guess1, N at position4 -> '-' says N in word but not pos4? In guess2, N at position5 -> '-'? So N not at position5? Also? So N cannot be at position4 or 5? Therefore, N must be at position 1,2, or 3.

For E:
- Not at position5 (guess1) and not at position3 (guess2) because in guess2 position3 E was '-'? So E cannot be at position3 or 5? So positions: 1,2,4.

For T:
- Not at position2? From guess2? Only? Because in guess2, T was at2 and '-', so not at2? So T can be at 1,3,4,5? We have not tested other positions.

Also, we know:
- Position1: in guess1 was C(x) -> not C? In guess2 was S(x) -> not S? So position1 could be R, N, E, T or X? But we know R,N,E,T are the letters? So X? Or one of them? Similarly.

Now, let's think about possible positions? We have to place R, N, E, T and one unknown letter in positions 1-5? With constraints?

We know:
- R: not 2 or 4? So available: 1,3,5? 
- N: not 4 or 5? So available: 1,2,3? 
- E: not 3 or 5? So available: 1,2,4? 
- T: not 2? So available: 1,3,4,5? 

We also need to introduce a new letter? Since we have only four known letters? So our next guess should include R,N,E,T and one new letter? And we must avoid the absent letters: C,A,S? And also choose the positions accordingly? 

But the new letter? We don't know? So we pick one that is common? And we put the known letters in positions that are still possible? 

So possible? Let's see? Let me denote X as the new letter? 

We need to form a word with R,N,E,T,X? But the word should be valid? 

Moreover, we want to put the known letters only in positions that are allowed? For example, we cannot put R at2 because we know it's not? Etc? 

So for R: we must put in 1,3, or 5? 
For N: in 1,2,3? 
For E: in 1,2,4? 
For T: in 1,3,4,5? 

We also need a position for the new letter? 

Now, let’s think? Can we assign positions? 

But we don't know? So we can choose a word that fits? 

For example, we might put E at position2? Which is possible? 

Similarly, possible words? 

One candidate: ""TENOR""? It has T,N,E,O,R? So letters: T,N,E,O,R? That matches: T, N, E, R? and O is new? Also O is common? And X=O? 

Now check positions: 
T E N O R? 
Position1: T? Possible? Because T can be at1? 
Position2: E? Possible? Because E can be at position2? 
Position3: N? Possible? N at3? It can be? 
Position4: O? New letter? 
Position5: R? Possible? R at5? 

Also, does it avoid absent? O is not C,A,S? 

Also, we need to check that we are not violating? 

In ""TENOR"":
- T at1: okay? Constraints? 
- E at2: not violated? 
- N at3: okay? 
- R at5: okay? 

And O at4? 

But from constraints, position4 can be O? Because we have no info? 

Also, note: in our previous guesses, position4 was originally N (in crane) and then R (in stern)? Both not correct? So position4 might be O? Or any? 

Similarly? 

But ""TENOR"" uses two E? Actually, ""TENOR"" has one E? So okay? 

Another candidate: ""INERT""? 
I,N,E,R,T? 
Positions: 
1:I? New? 
2:N? But N: constraints? N can be at position2? Because it must be at 1,2,3? 
3:E? But E: cannot be at position3? Because from guess2: E was at3 was '-', so we cannot put E at3? 

Therefore ""INERT"": E at position3? Not allowed? 

Similarly, ""INTER"" we tried before? But wait, we tried ""stern""? 

How about ""ENTER""? 
E,N,T,E,R? Has two E? But we don't know? There might be two E? But positions: 
1:E? Allowed? Because E can be at1? 
2:N? N allowed? 
3:T? T allowed? 
4:E? E allowed? Because not at position3? But position4? 
5:R? Allowed? 
But E at position1 and position4? 

But does the word have two E? Is ""ENTER"" 5 letters? Yes? 

But E is repeated? 

From feedback, we don't know? It could be? 

But we have E at position1? We know from first guess? Position1 was C? absent? So originally we didn't place E at1? 

But now? 

But wait: the constraint for E: only not at3 and5? Position1 and2 and4? So position1 is okay? 

Similarly? 

But we also need to test the unknown letter? So if the word has repeated E, we don't get new letter? So we lose information? Because we don't test a new letter? So it might be worse? 

Therefore, we should prefer a word without repetition? So ""TENOR"" is better? 

Another word: ""TUNER""? 
T,U,N,E,R? 
Positions: 
1:T? 
2:U? New? 
3:N? 
4:E? 
5:R? 
Now constraints: 
- T at1: allowed? 
- U at2: new? 
- N at3: allowed? 
- E at4: allowed? Because E can be at4? 
- R at5: allowed? 

Also, U? Not absent? 

So ""TUNER"" might be good? 

But similar? 

Another: ""GONER""? 
G,O,N,E,R? 
However, O? New? 
But check: 
1:G? New? 
2:O? New? 
3:N? 
4:E? 
5:R? 
But we have two new letters? That's okay? But we are testing? But we also cover? However, we don't have T? But T is known? We must put T? No: we don't want to? We know T is present? So if we don't put T, then we lose the chance to test it? We might? So we should include T? 

In ""TUNER"": we have T,R,N,E,U? So includes T? 

Similarly? 

But in ""TUNER""? 

Considering coverage? 

We know the fifth letter must be a letter? So we have R,N,E,T and one unknown? 

So I think including the four known and one unknown is best? 

So ""TENOR"" with O? Or ""TUNER"" with U? 

But U is less common? Perhaps O? 

Another possibility: how about ""TOKEN""? 
But K? And E? But we have to include R,N,T? ""TOKEN"" has T,O,K,E,N? But R is missing? But R is known? So we cannot skip? 

Therefore, we must include R? 

So candidates: 
- ""TENOR"": T,E,N,O,R? 
- ""RENT""? Not 5 letters? 
- ""INNER""? Has N repeated? And no T? 
- ""MINER""? But M? and we already know? But in guess2 we had stern? 

But ""MINER"": M,I,N,E,R? We have not tried M? 
Positions: 
1:M? 
2:I? 
3:N? 
4:E? 
5:R? 
Now constraints: 
- N: at position3? Allowed? 
- E: at position4? Not at3? Wait: but constraint E must not be at3? So position4 is allowed? 
- R: at position5? Allowed? 
But what about N? At position3? Is that okay? And also? 
But E at4: but in guess1, E at5 was not? Guess2 E at3 was not? So position4 is new? 

But also, we must include T? T is known? 

In ""MINER"", we don't have T? But T is present? So if we guess ""MINER"", then if T is not in it? But we know T is in the word? So ""MINER"" doesn't have T? So it cannot be the word? Then we would get feedback that I is present? Or not? But we know the secret word has T? So if we guess ""MINER"", we know it cannot be correct? Because it misses T? 

Therefore, we must include T? Or skip using it? But to save guesses, we should include known letters? So we require the word to contain T? 

Therefore, we must choose a word that has R, N, E, T and one new letter? 

So words: ""TENOR"", ""TUNER"", ""TONER"" (if it exists? toner? Yes)? 

""TONER"": T,O,N,E,R? Same as TENOR? 

So let's choose ""TENOR"": 
- It uses T,E,N,O,R? 
- Positions: T at1, E at2, N at3, O at4, R at5? 

Constraints:
- T at1: allowed? Because T not at2? And we haven't tested at1? 
- E at2: allowed? Because previously E was at5? and then at3? Not tried at2? And E not forbidden at2? 
- N at3: allowed? Because previously not at4 and not at5? And we haven't tried at3? 
- R at5: not forbidden? 
- O: new letter? 

Also, no repetition? 

Therefore, let's guess ""TENOR""? 

But note: position2 in ""TENOR"" is E? We know that in guess1, position2 was R and not? But E? We don't know? 

Also, we will get feedback? 

Alternatively, we can put E at position4? Like in ""TUNER""? 

But which one is more common word? Both? 

But I think ""TENOR"" is better? 

Another idea: we know that E cannot be at position3? So if we put E at3? It would be wrong? So avoid? 

In ""TENOR"", we don't put E at3? 

So I choose ""TENOR""? 

But we must ensure the new letter O is not C,A,S? Yes? 

So third guess: ""tenor""? 

But let's write? 

Conclusion: We guess ""TENOR""?
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Absent Letters**: C, A, S (confirmed not in the word).
- **Present Letters**: R, N, E, T (all confirmed to be in the word but not in the positions guessed so far).
- **Position Constraints**:
  - R: Not in position 2 or 4 → possible positions: 1, 3, 5.
  - N: Not in position 4 or 5 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3.
  - E: Not in position 3 or 5 → possible positions: 1, 2, 4.
  - T: Not in position 2 → possible positions: 1, 3, 4, 5.

For the third guess:
- Must include all present letters (R, N, E, T) and one new letter (to identify the fifth letter).
- Avoid absent letters (C, A, S).
- Respect position constraints for R, N, E, T.
- Test new common letters (e.g., O or U) to maximize information.

""TENOR"" (T, E, N, O, R) meets these criteria:
- Includes R, N, E, T (all present) and O (new letter).
- Positions:
  - T at position 1 → allowed (T not ruled out at position 1).
  - E at position 2 → allowed (E not ruled out at position 2).
  - N at position 3 → allowed (N not ruled out at position 3).
- Avoids C, A, S.
- O is a common vowel to test.

This guess helps verify:
- Whether O is the fifth letter or not.
- Positions of T at 1, E at 2, and N at 3, while respecting known constraints.

<guess>tenor</guess>",tenor,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
This tells us:
- C and A are not in the word.
- R, N, and E are in the word but:
  - R is not in position 2.
  - N is not in position 4.
  - E is not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""stern"" -> S(x) T(-) E(-) R(-) N(-)
This tells us:
- S is not in the word.
- T, E, R, and N are in the word but:
  - T is not in position 2 (because we got '-' at position 2? Actually: positions of ""stern"" are: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:R, 5:N).
  Feedback: S(x) at position 1 -> S absent.
            T(-) at position 2 -> T present but not at position 2.
            E(-) at position 3 -> E present but not at position 3.
            R(-) at position 4 -> R present but not at position 4.
            N(-) at position 5 -> N present but not at position 5.

Now we combine what we know:

Absent letters: C, A, S (from both guesses).

Present letters: R, N, E (from first guess) and T (from second guess). Also, we know E is present and now we have two confirmations.

But note: We don't have any letter that is in the correct position yet? All are '-'.

So we have confirmed letters: R, N, E, T are in the word? And from guess1 we also know R,N,E? Now from guess2 we have T? And R,N,E again? So the letters are R, N, E, T and one more? Because it's a 5-letter word? And we have not found the fifth letter? We know S is absent? So we need to find the fifth letter.

The secret word must be composed of: R, N, E, T, and one unknown letter? And must not contain C, A, S? And we have 6 letters? But we have only 4? So one more letter? We don't know? We have known letters: R, N, E, T? Four? So we need one more? How many absent? We have C, A, S absent? But there might be others? We don't know? We need to test more letters.

Also, we have information about the positions? So let's summarize:

Known absent: C, A, S.

Known present: R, N, E, T? And one unknown? Or maybe five? But we have only found four? So one more letter? And we haven't tried many other letters? Like B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? So we need to test one of these? But we know that R, N, E, T are in the word? So the secret word is formed by R, N, E, T and one other letter? Let’s call it X? And we don't know X? So we must find X and the positions? 

But note: From feedback, we know positions that are not allowed:

For R: 
- Not at position 2 (from guess1) and not at position 4 (from guess2)? Because in guess2, position4 R was '-'? So R is not at 2 or 4? So possible positions for R: 1, 3, 5.

Similarly, N:
- Not at position 4 (guess1) and not at position 5 (guess2) because in guess2, position5 N was '-'? Wait: in guess1, N at position4 -> '-' says N in word but not pos4? In guess2, N at position5 -> '-'? So N not at position5? Also? So N cannot be at position4 or 5? Therefore, N must be at position 1,2, or 3.

For E:
- Not at position5 (guess1) and not at position3 (guess2) because in guess2 position3 E was '-'? So E cannot be at position3 or 5? So positions: 1,2,4.

For T:
- Not at position2? From guess2? Only? Because in guess2, T was at2 and '-', so not at2? So T can be at 1,3,4,5? We have not tested other positions.

Also, we know:
- Position1: in guess1 was C(x) -> not C? In guess2 was S(x) -> not S? So position1 could be R, N, E, T or X? But we know R,N,E,T are the letters? So X? Or one of them? Similarly.

Now, let's think about possible positions? We have to place R, N, E, T and one unknown letter in positions 1-5? With constraints?

We know:
- R: not 2 or 4? So available: 1,3,5? 
- N: not 4 or 5? So available: 1,2,3? 
- E: not 3 or 5? So available: 1,2,4? 
- T: not 2? So available: 1,3,4,5? 

We also need to introduce a new letter? Since we have only four known letters? So our next guess should include R,N,E,T and one new letter? And we must avoid the absent letters: C,A,S? And also choose the positions accordingly? 

But the new letter? We don't know? So we pick one that is common? And we put the known letters in positions that are still possible? 

So possible? Let's see? Let me denote X as the new letter? 

We need to form a word with R,N,E,T,X? But the word should be valid? 

Moreover, we want to put the known letters only in positions that are allowed? For example, we cannot put R at2 because we know it's not? Etc? 

So for R: we must put in 1,3, or 5? 
For N: in 1,2,3? 
For E: in 1,2,4? 
For T: in 1,3,4,5? 

We also need a position for the new letter? 

Now, let’s think? Can we assign positions? 

But we don't know? So we can choose a word that fits? 

For example, we might put E at position2? Which is possible? 

Similarly, possible words? 

One candidate: ""TENOR""? It has T,N,E,O,R? So letters: T,N,E,O,R? That matches: T, N, E, R? and O is new? Also O is common? And X=O? 

Now check positions: 
T E N O R? 
Position1: T? Possible? Because T can be at1? 
Position2: E? Possible? Because E can be at position2? 
Position3: N? Possible? N at3? It can be? 
Position4: O? New letter? 
Position5: R? Possible? R at5? 

Also, does it avoid absent? O is not C,A,S? 

Also, we need to check that we are not violating? 

In ""TENOR"":
- T at1: okay? Constraints? 
- E at2: not violated? 
- N at3: okay? 
- R at5: okay? 

And O at4? 

But from constraints, position4 can be O? Because we have no info? 

Also, note: in our previous guesses, position4 was originally N (in crane) and then R (in stern)? Both not correct? So position4 might be O? Or any? 

Similarly? 

But ""TENOR"" uses two E? Actually, ""TENOR"" has one E? So okay? 

Another candidate: ""INERT""? 
I,N,E,R,T? 
Positions: 
1:I? New? 
2:N? But N: constraints? N can be at position2? Because it must be at 1,2,3? 
3:E? But E: cannot be at position3? Because from guess2: E was at3 was '-', so we cannot put E at3? 

Therefore ""INERT"": E at position3? Not allowed? 

Similarly, ""INTER"" we tried before? But wait, we tried ""stern""? 

How about ""ENTER""? 
E,N,T,E,R? Has two E? But we don't know? There might be two E? But positions: 
1:E? Allowed? Because E can be at1? 
2:N? N allowed? 
3:T? T allowed? 
4:E? E allowed? Because not at position3? But position4? 
5:R? Allowed? 
But E at position1 and position4? 

But does the word have two E? Is ""ENTER"" 5 letters? Yes? 

But E is repeated? 

From feedback, we don't know? It could be? 

But we have E at position1? We know from first guess? Position1 was C? absent? So originally we didn't place E at1? 

But now? 

But wait: the constraint for E: only not at3 and5? Position1 and2 and4? So position1 is okay? 

Similarly? 

But we also need to test the unknown letter? So if the word has repeated E, we don't get new letter? So we lose information? Because we don't test a new letter? So it might be worse? 

Therefore, we should prefer a word without repetition? So ""TENOR"" is better? 

Another word: ""TUNER""? 
T,U,N,E,R? 
Positions: 
1:T? 
2:U? New? 
3:N? 
4:E? 
5:R? 
Now constraints: 
- T at1: allowed? 
- U at2: new? 
- N at3: allowed? 
- E at4: allowed? Because E can be at4? 
- R at5: allowed? 

Also, U? Not absent? 

So ""TUNER"" might be good? 

But similar? 

Another: ""GONER""? 
G,O,N,E,R? 
However, O? New? 
But check: 
1:G? New? 
2:O? New? 
3:N? 
4:E? 
5:R? 
But we have two new letters? That's okay? But we are testing? But we also cover? However, we don't have T? But T is known? We must put T? No: we don't want to? We know T is present? So if we don't put T, then we lose the chance to test it? We might? So we should include T? 

In ""TUNER"": we have T,R,N,E,U? So includes T? 

Similarly? 

But in ""TUNER""? 

Considering coverage? 

We know the fifth letter must be a letter? So we have R,N,E,T and one unknown? 

So I think including the four known and one unknown is best? 

So ""TENOR"" with O? Or ""TUNER"" with U? 

But U is less common? Perhaps O? 

Another possibility: how about ""TOKEN""? 
But K? And E? But we have to include R,N,T? ""TOKEN"" has T,O,K,E,N? But R is missing? But R is known? So we cannot skip? 

Therefore, we must include R? 

So candidates: 
- ""TENOR"": T,E,N,O,R? 
- ""RENT""? Not 5 letters? 
- ""INNER""? Has N repeated? And no T? 
- ""MINER""? But M? and we already know? But in guess2 we had stern? 

But ""MINER"": M,I,N,E,R? We have not tried M? 
Positions: 
1:M? 
2:I? 
3:N? 
4:E? 
5:R? 
Now constraints: 
- N: at position3? Allowed? 
- E: at position4? Not at3? Wait: but constraint E must not be at3? So position4 is allowed? 
- R: at position5? Allowed? 
But what about N? At position3? Is that okay? And also? 
But E at4: but in guess1, E at5 was not? Guess2 E at3 was not? So position4 is new? 

But also, we must include T? T is known? 

In ""MINER"", we don't have T? But T is present? So if we guess ""MINER"", then if T is not in it? But we know T is in the word? So ""MINER"" doesn't have T? So it cannot be the word? Then we would get feedback that I is present? Or not? But we know the secret word has T? So if we guess ""MINER"", we know it cannot be correct? Because it misses T? 

Therefore, we must include T? Or skip using it? But to save guesses, we should include known letters? So we require the word to contain T? 

Therefore, we must choose a word that has R, N, E, T and one new letter? 

So words: ""TENOR"", ""TUNER"", ""TONER"" (if it exists? toner? Yes)? 

""TONER"": T,O,N,E,R? Same as TENOR? 

So let's choose ""TENOR"": 
- It uses T,E,N,O,R? 
- Positions: T at1, E at2, N at3, O at4, R at5? 

Constraints:
- T at1: allowed? Because T not at2? And we haven't tested at1? 
- E at2: allowed? Because previously E was at5? and then at3? Not tried at2? And E not forbidden at2? 
- N at3: allowed? Because previously not at4 and not at5? And we haven't tried at3? 
- R at5: not forbidden? 
- O: new letter? 

Also, no repetition? 

Therefore, let's guess ""TENOR""? 

But note: position2 in ""TENOR"" is E? We know that in guess1, position2 was R and not? But E? We don't know? 

Also, we will get feedback? 

Alternatively, we can put E at position4? Like in ""TUNER""? 

But which one is more common word? Both? 

But I think ""TENOR"" is better? 

Another idea: we know that E cannot be at position3? So if we put E at3? It would be wrong? So avoid? 

In ""TENOR"", we don't put E at3? 

So I choose ""TENOR""? 

But we must ensure the new letter O is not C,A,S? Yes? 

So third guess: ""tenor""? 

But let's write? 

Conclusion: We guess ""TENOR""?Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Absent Letters**: C, A, S (confirmed not in the word).
