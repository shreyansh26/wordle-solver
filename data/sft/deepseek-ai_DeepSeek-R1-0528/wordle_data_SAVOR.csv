We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for our first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C and N and E are not in the word at all.
 - R is in the word but not in the position we guessed (which was the 2nd position).
 - A is in the word but not in the position we guessed (which was the 3rd position).

 So the secret word contains R and A, but not C, N, E.

 Also, since R and A are present, but not in the positions we guessed, we know:
 - R cannot be in the 2nd position (but must be in some other position: 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th).
 - A cannot be in the 3rd position (but must be in some other position: 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th).

 Additionally, the secret word does not contain: C, N, E.

 For our next guess, we should:
 1. Make sure to include R and A (since we know they are in the word).
 2. Avoid using any of the letters that are not present: C, N, E.
 3. We can use other letters that are common to get more information.

 Let's think of words that contain R and A, but not C, N, E.

 Also, note that the word must be 5 letters.

 We must avoid placing R and A in the positions that are already known to be wrong for them?
 Actually, for R: we guessed it in position 2 and it was wrong, but we don't know where it belongs. Similarly for A.

 However, we should try a word where R and A are in different positions than before.

 Common positions to try:
 Since R was excluded from position 2, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, A should not be in position 3, so we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We don't know the positions, so we can experiment.

 Also, we should introduce new letters to get more information.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

 We want to cover multiple common letters.

 Let's brainstorm words that include R and A, and three new letters, excluding C, N, E.

 Possible words: 
 - ""RATIO"": has R, A, T, I, O -> good letters? But note: R is in position 1 (different from before) and A in 2 (which was not the 3rd, so allowed). However, we don't know if A can be in 2nd? Feedback didn't say anything about A in 2nd? Yes, we can try.

 But note: We must avoid placing R in the 2nd? Actually we guessed R in 2nd and it was wrong, but that doesn't mean we cannot put R in 2nd in a future guess? Wait, no: because the feedback said that R is in the word but not in the 2nd position. So we must avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we are allowed to guess R in position 2 again? But we know it's wrong, so it would be inefficient.

 For our next guess, we should not put R in the 2nd position because we know it doesn't belong there. Similarly, A should not be put in the 3rd.

 So for ""RATIO"":
  position1: R -> might be correct? possible.
  position2: A -> not forbidden for A? Only forbidden was position 3 for A? So yes, we can try A in 2.

 But the secret word might have R in a different position? We know R is not in 2nd, but we don't know about A: it might be in 2nd? We need to check.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"": but note that we must avoid E and N and C? 
  ""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T -> avoids C, N, E. 
  R in 1st, which is allowed (since we only know 2nd is bad for R). 
  A in 3rd? Wait, our feedback said A is not in the 3rd? So we cannot put A in 3rd? Because we already know that A is present but not in 3rd. So if we guess ""ROAST"", we would put A in 3rd again? That would be inefficient because we know it should be elsewhere.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the 3rd position for this new guess.

 Let me think of words that have A and R, and don't have C, N, E, and avoid placing A at position 3 and R at position 2.

 Also, we haven't tried S, T, O, etc.

 How about ""STAMP""? 
  - S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but wait, we must avoid A at position 3? So we cannot use A in position 3. 
  So ""STAMP"" is invalid for our guess because it puts A at 3rd which we know is wrong.

 What about ""PARTS""?
  P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, T at 4, S at 5.
  - A is in 2nd: that's okay (since we don't know anything about position 2 for A? Only that 3rd is wrong). 
  - R is in 3rd: that's okay? Because we only know R was wrong in 2nd? So R in 3rd is a new position? Yes.

 Let me check: 
  Position for R: not in 2nd -> so we can put R in 1,3,4,5.
  Position for A: not in 3rd -> so we can put A in 1,2,4,5.

 So ""PARTS"": 
  A is in position 2: allowed.
  R is in position 3: allowed.

 And it avoids C, N, E.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TRAIL"": 
   T, R, A, I, L 
   R in position 2 -> but wait, we know R is not in position 2? So that would be inefficient. Therefore, avoid placing R in position 2.

 Therefore, words that have R in 2nd should be avoided? Yes.

 Other ideas: ""RAPID"", ""BARES"" (but B is new?), ""RASPY"", ""GRAPE"" (but E is disallowed? because we know E is not in the word? Yes, E is disallowed).

 So ""GRAPE"" is invalid because of E.

 How about ""DRAWL""? 
   D, R, A, W, L -> avoids C,N,E? 
   R is in 2nd -> avoid? Because we know R is not in 2nd? So don't use that.

 Alternatively, ""ARGUE""? 
   A, R, G, U, E -> but E is disallowed? Yes, we cannot use E.

 Another word: ""ORBIT""? 
   O, R, B, I, T -> but doesn't include A? We must include A because we know it's in the word? No, we have to include both R and A? We don't have to, but including them might help? Actually, we know both R and A are present. If we don't include them, we might get feedback that doesn't tell us about their positions? So we should try to include known letters to pin down their positions.

 Therefore, I think we should include both R and A.

 Let me prioritize including R and A in new positions.

 Possibilities:
  R in position 1: words like R__?__ 
      R A ? ? ? : but also avoid position 3 for A? So A must be in 4th or 5th? Or position 2? 
      Example: ""RADIO""? -> R, A, D, I, O -> but A in position 2? That's okay? And avoid C,N,E? 
          Also, we don't have any restrictions for the other letters? 
      So ""RADIO"": 
        - R at 1: allowed 
        - A at 2: allowed? We don't know? Only 3rd is forbidden? So 2nd is open.
        - D, I, O are new.

  Alternatively, ""RASPY"": 
      R, A, S, P, Y 
      R at 1, A at 2 -> avoids C,N,E? 
      But same position for A? Well, position 2 is allowed? But what about R? Position 1 is allowed? 

  However, we also need to consider that we don't know if A can be at position 2? So we try?

 But note: the feedback only said A is not in the 3rd. It might very well be in the 2nd? So we can try.

 But also, we know R cannot be in the 2nd? And we are putting R in 1st? That's a new position? Good.

 However, let's check for other common words: ""PARTY"" -> P, A, R, T, Y -> 
   Positions: 
     A at 2nd -> allowed
     R at 3rd -> allowed (because only 2nd is bad so far)
   But R at 3rd? We don't know? So that could be? 

 Compare: we have two known letters R and A, and we want to test them in positions we haven't tried? 
  For R, we only tried position 2? So now we can try position 1,3,4, or 5? 
  Similarly for A: we only tried position 3? So we can try 1,2,4,5.

 We also want to maximize new letter information.

 Perhaps ""PARTY"" is a good candidate? 
   Letters: P, A, R, T, Y -> all new? 

 But note: in ""crane"", we didn't have P, T, Y? So that would introduce three new letters? And also use R and A.

 However, in ""PARTY"": 
   Position1: P -> new
   Position2: A -> testing if A is there? 
   Position3: R -> testing if R is in 3rd? 
   Position4: T -> new
   Position5: Y -> new

 But wait: we have R and A both in the word? And we are testing R at 3rd and A at 2nd? Which are both allowed? 

 Alternatively, what about ""RABBI""? -> but that has repeated letters? And we don't know if repeated letters are in the word? Also, we should avoid repeats? Not necessary, but might be inefficient? But let's choose words with unique letters? 

 Also, ""RABBI"" is not common? and has B and I? But also allows A in 2nd? 

 Actually, we want to use distinct letters? Because if there are repeated letters we might get less information? 

 So let's aim for distinct letters.

 Therefore, ""RADIO"" and ""PARTY"" and ""RASPY"" are candidates? 

 But note: in the secret word, we don't know if there are repeated letters? So we could avoid repeating? And since the feedback doesn't indicate repetition? So we can assume distinct? 

 Now, to decide: we want to cover more common vowels and consonants? 

 Common vowels: A, O, I? We already have O and I in ""RADIO""? 

 Common consonants: S, T, R? We have R and T and S? 

 How about ""RAINS""? -> but N was disallowed? Because in first guess N was marked x? So not in word? So ""RAINS"" invalid? 

 Similarly, ""CARES"" -> C is disallowed? 

 So best candidate: ""RADIO"" vs ""PARTY"" vs ""RASPY""

 Let me pick ""PARTY"" because it has R and A in two new positions? And also introduces P, T, Y? 

 Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" is invalid because if we put R in 2nd -> which we know is wrong? 

 How about ""ROAST""? 
   We decided against because A is in 3rd? We know A is not in 3rd? So why repeat? 

 Therefore, I think ""PARTY"" is a good choice.

 But what about the word ""PARKS""? 
   P, A, R, K, S -> A in 2nd? R in 3rd? Both allowed? And K and S are new? 

 Also good? 

 Maybe I'll choose a word that doesn't have R and A adjacent? 

 Another candidate: ""FLAIR""? 
   F, L, A, I, R -> 
   A in position 3? But wait, we know A is not in position 3? So we cannot put A in 3rd? 

 Therefore, ""FLAIR"" is invalid? 

 How about ""STAIR""? 
   S, T, A, I, R -> 
   A in position 3 -> forbidden? So invalid.

 Alternative: ""ARTIS""? Wait, ARTIS is not a word? 

 Let me pick a word: ""GRAPY""? Not a word.

 How about ""BRAVE""? 
   But B, R, A, V, E -> E is disallowed? 

 ""FRAME"": has E? 

 ""GLARE"": has E? 

 ""SHARP"": 
   S, H, A, R, P -> 
   Position1: S
   Position2: H
   Position3: A -> but we cannot put A in 3rd? So invalid.

 ""HORDE"": has E? 

 ""AMBER"": has E? 

 ""PLAIN"": has N? disallowed.

 So back to: ""RASPY"", ""RADIO"", ""PARTY"", ""PARKS"".

 I think ""RADIO"" and ""PARTY"" are both good? 
  ""RADIO"": A in 2nd and R in 1st? 
  ""PARTY"": A in 2nd and R in 3rd? 

 Which one? 
  For ""RADIO"": 
    If the word has R in 1st, we get a ✓ for R? 
    And A in 2nd, could it be? 

  For ""PARTY"": 
    A in 2nd and R in 3rd? 

 Actually, we don't know? 

 Another factor: We want to include common letters that we haven't tried? 
  First guess ""CRANE"" tested: C, R, A, N, E -> we know about R and A.

  Therefore, we should introduce letters that aren't excluded: so letters like S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

  In ""RADIO"": D and I and O? 
  In ""PARTY"": P, T, Y? 

 Common letters: T appears in a lot of words? So maybe including T is better? 

 Also, note: we know the word doesn't have C, N, E? So we can use T? 

 I think ""PARTY"" is a good choice? 

 Alternatively, ""RUSTY"": 
   R, U, S, T, Y -> 
   R in 1st? 
   But A? We must include A? No, we don't have A? We know A is in the word, so if we don't include A, we won't get information about A's position? Then we'll have to guess it later? However, by including we can get feedback on A? 

 But note: we already know A is in the word? Yes, so if we don't include it, then the feedback won't tell us anything about its position? So we might have to try again later? It's better to use it? 

 Therefore, we must include A? Actually, no, we are not forced? But it's recommended? 

 We have 6 guesses? And we might get information? So let's include both R and A? 

 Therefore, I'll go with ""PARTY"".

 Guess: ""party""
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)), we know:
- R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- C, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- We need a new guess that includes R and A in positions other than 2 (for R) and 3 (for A), while avoiding C, N, E.

For an optimal second guess:
- Include R and A in untried positions to locate them (e.g., try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5, and A in 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Introduce new common letters like T, P, and Y to gather more information.
- Avoid repeating the ineffective positions from the first guess.

""party"" fits perfectly:
- P, T, Y are new untested letters.
- A is placed in position 2 (untried, since only position 3 was ruled out).
- R is placed in position 3 (untried, since only position 2 was ruled out).
- Uses distinct letters and excludes known absent letters (C, N, E).

This guess maximizes letter coverage and position testing for R and A.

<guess>party</guess>",party,"We are given feedback for our first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C and N and E are not in the word at all.
 - R is in the word but not in the position we guessed (which was the 2nd position).
 - A is in the word but not in the position we guessed (which was the 3rd position).

 So the secret word contains R and A, but not C, N, E.

 Also, since R and A are present, but not in the positions we guessed, we know:
 - R cannot be in the 2nd position (but must be in some other position: 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th).
 - A cannot be in the 3rd position (but must be in some other position: 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th).

 Additionally, the secret word does not contain: C, N, E.

 For our next guess, we should:
 1. Make sure to include R and A (since we know they are in the word).
 2. Avoid using any of the letters that are not present: C, N, E.

 However, we should try a word where R and A are in different positions than before.

 Common positions to try:
 Since R was excluded from position 2, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, A should not be in position 3, so we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We don't know the positions, so we can experiment.

 Also, we should introduce new letters to get more information.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

 We want to cover multiple common letters.

 Let's brainstorm words that include R and A, and three new letters, excluding C, N, E.

 Possible words: 
 - ""RATIO"": has R, A, T, I, O -> good letters? But note: R is in position 1 (different from before) and A in 2 (which was not the 3rd, so allowed). However, we don't know if A can be in 2nd? Feedback didn't say anything about A in 2nd? Yes, we can try.

 But note: We must avoid placing R in the 2nd? Actually we guessed R in 2nd and it was wrong, but that doesn't mean we cannot put R in 2nd in a future guess? Wait, no: because the feedback said that R is in the word but not in the 2nd position. So we must avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we are allowed to guess R in position 2 again? But we know it's wrong, so it would be inefficient.

 For our next guess, we should not put R in the 2nd position because we know it doesn't belong there. Similarly, A should not be put in the 3rd.

 So for ""RATIO"":
  position1: R -> might be correct? possible.
  position2: A -> not forbidden for A? Only forbidden was position 3 for A? So yes, we can try A in 2.

 But the secret word might have R in a different position? We know R is not in 2nd, but we don't know about A: it might be in 2nd? We need to check.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"": but note that we must avoid E and N and C? 
  ""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T -> avoids C, N, E. 
  R in 1st, which is allowed (since we only know 2nd is bad for R). 
  A in 3rd? Wait, our feedback said A is not in the 3rd? So we cannot put A in 3rd? Because we already know that A is present but not in 3rd. So if we guess ""ROAST"", we would put A in 3rd again? That would be inefficient because we know it should be elsewhere.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the 3rd position for this new guess.

 Let me think of words that have A and R, and don't have C, N, E, and avoid placing A at position 3 and R at position 2.

 Also, we haven't tried S, T, O, etc.

 How about ""STAMP""? 
  - S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but wait, we must avoid A at position 3? So we cannot use A in position 3. 
  So ""STAMP"" is invalid for our guess because it puts A at 3rd which we know is wrong.

 What about ""PARTS""?
  P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, T at 4, S at 5.
  - A is in 2nd: that's okay (since we don't know anything about position 2 for A? Only that 3rd is wrong). 
  - R is in 3rd: that's okay? Because we only know R was wrong in 2nd? So R in 3rd is a new position? Yes.

 Let me check: 
  Position for R: not in 2nd -> so we can put R in 1,3,4,5.
  Position for A: not in 3rd -> so we can put A in 1,2,4,5.

 So ""PARTS"": 
  A is in position 2: allowed.
  R is in position 3: allowed.

 And it avoids C, N, E.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TRAIL"": 
   T, R, A, I, L 
   R in position 2 -> but wait, we know R is not in position 2? So that would be inefficient. Therefore, avoid placing R in position 2.

 Therefore, words that have R in 2nd should be avoided? Yes.

 Other ideas: ""RAPID"", ""BARES"" (but B is new?), ""RASPY"", ""GRAPE"" (but E is disallowed? because we know E is not in the word? Yes, E is disallowed).

 So ""GRAPE"" is invalid because of E.

 How about ""DRAWL""? 
   D, R, A, W, L -> avoids C,N,E? 
   R is in 2nd -> avoid? Because we know R is not in 2nd? So don't use that.

 Alternatively, ""ARGUE""? 
   A, R, G, U, E -> but E is disallowed? Yes, we cannot use E.

 Another word: ""ORBIT""? 
   O, R, B, I, T -> but doesn't include A? We must include A because we know it's in the word? No, we have to include both R and A? We don't have to, but including them might help? Actually, we know both R and A are present. If we don't include them, we might get feedback that doesn't tell us about their positions? So we should try to include known letters to pin down their positions.

 Therefore, I think we should include both R and A.

 Let me prioritize including R and A in new positions.

 Possibilities:
  R in position 1: words like R__?__ 
      R A ? ? ? : but also avoid position 3 for A? So A must be in 4th or 5th? Or position 2? 
      Example: ""RADIO""? -> R, A, D, I, O -> but A in position 2? That's okay? And avoid C,N,E? 
          Also, we don't have any restrictions for the other letters? 
      So ""RADIO"": 
        - R at 1: allowed 
        - A at 2: allowed? We don't know? Only 3rd is forbidden? So 2nd is open.
        - D, I, O are new.

  Alternatively, ""RASPY"": 
      R, A, S, P, Y 
      R at 1, A at 2 -> avoids C,N,E? 
      But same position for A? Well, position 2 is allowed? But what about R? Position 1 is allowed? 

  However, we also need to consider that we don't know if A can be at position 2? So we try?

 But note: the feedback only said A is not in the 3rd. It might very well be in the 2nd? So we can try.

 But also, we know R cannot be in the 2nd? And we are putting R in 1st? That's a new position? Good.

 However, let's check for other common words: ""PARTY"" -> P, A, R, T, Y -> 
   Positions: 
     A at 2nd -> allowed
     R at 3rd -> allowed (because only 2nd is bad so far)
   But R at 3rd? We don't know? So that could be? 

 Compare: we have two known letters R and A, and we want to test them in positions we haven't tried? 
  For R, we only tried position 2? So now we can try position 1,3,4, or 5? 
  Similarly for A: we only tried position 3? So we can try 1,2,4,5.

 We also want to maximize new letter information.

 Perhaps ""PARTY"" is a good candidate? 
   Letters: P, A, R, T, Y -> all new? 

 But note: in ""crane"", we didn't have P, T, Y? So that would introduce three new letters? And also use R and A.

 However, in ""PARTY"": 
   Position1: P -> new
   Position2: A -> testing if A is there? 
   Position3: R -> testing if R is in 3rd? 
   Position4: T -> new
   Position5: Y -> new

 But wait: we have R and A both in the word? And we are testing R at 3rd and A at 2nd? Which are both allowed? 

 Alternatively, what about ""RABBI""? -> but that has repeated letters? And we don't know if repeated letters are in the word? Also, we should avoid repeats? Not necessary, but might be inefficient? But let's choose words with unique letters? 

 Also, ""RABBI"" is not common? and has B and I? But also allows A in 2nd? 

 Actually, we want to use distinct letters? Because if there are repeated letters we might get less information? 

 So let's aim for distinct letters.

 Therefore, ""RADIO"" and ""PARTY"" and ""RASPY"" are candidates? 

 But note: in the secret word, we don't know if there are repeated letters? So we could avoid repeating? And since the feedback doesn't indicate repetition? So we can assume distinct? 

 Now, to decide: we want to cover more common vowels and consonants? 

 Common vowels: A, O, I? We already have O and I in ""RADIO""? 

 Common consonants: S, T, R? We have R and T and S? 

 How about ""RAINS""? -> but N was disallowed? Because in first guess N was marked x? So not in word? So ""RAINS"" invalid? 

 Similarly, ""CARES"" -> C is disallowed? 

 So best candidate: ""RADIO"" vs ""PARTY"" vs ""RASPY""

 Let me pick ""PARTY"" because it has R and A in two new positions? And also introduces P, T, Y? 

 Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" is invalid because if we put R in 2nd -> which we know is wrong? 

 How about ""ROAST""? 
   We decided against because A is in 3rd? We know A is not in 3rd? So why repeat? 

 Therefore, I think ""PARTY"" is a good choice.

 But what about the word ""PARKS""? 
   P, A, R, K, S -> A in 2nd? R in 3rd? Both allowed? And K and S are new? 

 Also good? 

 Maybe I'll choose a word that doesn't have R and A adjacent? 

 Another candidate: ""FLAIR""? 
   F, L, A, I, R -> 
   A in position 3? But wait, we know A is not in position 3? So we cannot put A in 3rd? 

 Therefore, ""FLAIR"" is invalid? 

 How about ""STAIR""? 
   S, T, A, I, R -> 
   A in position 3 -> forbidden? So invalid.

 Alternative: ""ARTIS""? Wait, ARTIS is not a word? 

 Let me pick a word: ""GRAPY""? Not a word.

 How about ""BRAVE""? 
   But B, R, A, V, E -> E is disallowed? 

 ""FRAME"": has E? 

 ""GLARE"": has E? 

 ""SHARP"": 
   S, H, A, R, P -> 
   Position1: S
   Position2: H
   Position3: A -> but we cannot put A in 3rd? So invalid.

 ""HORDE"": has E? 

 ""AMBER"": has E? 

 ""PLAIN"": has N? disallowed.

 So back to: ""RASPY"", ""RADIO"", ""PARTY"", ""PARKS"".

 I think ""RADIO"" and ""PARTY"" are both good? 
  ""RADIO"": A in 2nd and R in 1st? 
  ""PARTY"": A in 2nd and R in 3rd? 

 Which one? 
  For ""RADIO"": 
    If the word has R in 1st, we get a ✓ for R? 
    And A in 2nd, could it be? 

  For ""PARTY"": 
    A in 2nd and R in 3rd? 

 Actually, we don't know? 

 Another factor: We want to include common letters that we haven't tried? 
  First guess ""CRANE"" tested: C, R, A, N, E -> we know about R and A.

  Therefore, we should introduce letters that aren't excluded: so letters like S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

  In ""RADIO"": D and I and O? 
  In ""PARTY"": P, T, Y? 

 Common letters: T appears in a lot of words? So maybe including T is better? 

 Also, note: we know the word doesn't have C, N, E? So we can use T? 

 I think ""PARTY"" is a good choice? 

 Alternatively, ""RUSTY"": 
   R, U, S, T, Y -> 
   R in 1st? 
   But A? We must include A? No, we don't have A? We know A is in the word, so if we don't include A, we won't get information about A's position? Then we'll have to guess it later? However, by including we can get feedback on A? 

 But note: we already know A is in the word? Yes, so if we don't include it, then the feedback won't tell us anything about its position? So we might have to try again later? It's better to use it? 

 Therefore, we must include A? Actually, no, we are not forced? But it's recommended? 

 We have 6 guesses? And we might get information? So let's include both R and A? 

 Therefore, I'll go with ""PARTY"".

 Guess: ""party""After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)), we know:
- R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- C, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- We need a new guess that includes R and A in positions other than 2 (for R) and 3 (for A), while avoiding C, N, E.

For an optimal second guess:
- Include R and A in untried positions to locate them (e.g., try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5, and A in 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Introduce new common letters like T, P, and Y to gather more information.
- Avoid repeating the ineffective positions from the first guess.

""party"" fits perfectly:
- P, T, Y are new untested letters.
- A is placed in position 2 (untried, since only position 3 was ruled out).
- R is placed in position 3 (untried, since only position 2 was ruled out).
- Uses distinct letters and excludes known absent letters (C, N, E).

This guess maximizes letter coverage and position testing for R and A.",Guess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(-) T(x) Y(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,SAVOR,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for our first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C and N and E are not in the word at all.
 - R is in the word but not in the position we guessed (which was the 2nd position).
 - A is in the word but not in the position we guessed (which was the 3rd position).

 So the secret word contains R and A, but not C, N, E.

 Also, since R and A are present, but not in the positions we guessed, we know:
 - R cannot be in the 2nd position (but must be in some other position: 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th).
 - A cannot be in the 3rd position (but must be in some other position: 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th).

 Additionally, the secret word does not contain: C, N, E.

 For our next guess, we should:
 1. Make sure to include R and A (since we know they are in the word).
 2. Avoid using any of the letters that are not present: C, N, E.
 3. We can use other letters that are common to get more information.

 Let's think of words that contain R and A, but not C, N, E.

 Also, note that the word must be 5 letters.

 We must avoid placing R and A in the positions that are already known to be wrong for them?
 Actually, for R: we guessed it in position 2 and it was wrong, but we don't know where it belongs. Similarly for A.

 However, we should try a word where R and A are in different positions than before.

 Common positions to try:
 Since R was excluded from position 2, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, A should not be in position 3, so we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We don't know the positions, so we can experiment.

 Also, we should introduce new letters to get more information.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

 We want to cover multiple common letters.

 Let's brainstorm words that include R and A, and three new letters, excluding C, N, E.

 Possible words: 
 - ""RATIO"": has R, A, T, I, O -> good letters? But note: R is in position 1 (different from before) and A in 2 (which was not the 3rd, so allowed). However, we don't know if A can be in 2nd? Feedback didn't say anything about A in 2nd? Yes, we can try.

 But note: We must avoid placing R in the 2nd? Actually we guessed R in 2nd and it was wrong, but that doesn't mean we cannot put R in 2nd in a future guess? Wait, no: because the feedback said that R is in the word but not in the 2nd position. So we must avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we are allowed to guess R in position 2 again? But we know it's wrong, so it would be inefficient.

 For our next guess, we should not put R in the 2nd position because we know it doesn't belong there. Similarly, A should not be put in the 3rd.

 So for ""RATIO"":
  position1: R -> might be correct? possible.
  position2: A -> not forbidden for A? Only forbidden was position 3 for A? So yes, we can try A in 2.

 But the secret word might have R in a different position? We know R is not in 2nd, but we don't know about A: it might be in 2nd? We need to check.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"": but note that we must avoid E and N and C? 
  ""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T -> avoids C, N, E. 
  R in 1st, which is allowed (since we only know 2nd is bad for R). 
  A in 3rd? Wait, our feedback said A is not in the 3rd? So we cannot put A in 3rd? Because we already know that A is present but not in 3rd. So if we guess ""ROAST"", we would put A in 3rd again? That would be inefficient because we know it should be elsewhere.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the 3rd position for this new guess.

 Let me think of words that have A and R, and don't have C, N, E, and avoid placing A at position 3 and R at position 2.

 Also, we haven't tried S, T, O, etc.

 How about ""STAMP""? 
  - S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but wait, we must avoid A at position 3? So we cannot use A in position 3. 
  So ""STAMP"" is invalid for our guess because it puts A at 3rd which we know is wrong.

 What about ""PARTS""?
  P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, T at 4, S at 5.
  - A is in 2nd: that's okay (since we don't know anything about position 2 for A? Only that 3rd is wrong). 
  - R is in 3rd: that's okay? Because we only know R was wrong in 2nd? So R in 3rd is a new position? Yes.

 Let me check: 
  Position for R: not in 2nd -> so we can put R in 1,3,4,5.
  Position for A: not in 3rd -> so we can put A in 1,2,4,5.

 So ""PARTS"": 
  A is in position 2: allowed.
  R is in position 3: allowed.

 And it avoids C, N, E.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TRAIL"": 
   T, R, A, I, L 
   R in position 2 -> but wait, we know R is not in position 2? So that would be inefficient. Therefore, avoid placing R in position 2.

 Therefore, words that have R in 2nd should be avoided? Yes.

 Other ideas: ""RAPID"", ""BARES"" (but B is new?), ""RASPY"", ""GRAPE"" (but E is disallowed? because we know E is not in the word? Yes, E is disallowed).

 So ""GRAPE"" is invalid because of E.

 How about ""DRAWL""? 
   D, R, A, W, L -> avoids C,N,E? 
   R is in 2nd -> avoid? Because we know R is not in 2nd? So don't use that.

 Alternatively, ""ARGUE""? 
   A, R, G, U, E -> but E is disallowed? Yes, we cannot use E.

 Another word: ""ORBIT""? 
   O, R, B, I, T -> but doesn't include A? We must include A because we know it's in the word? No, we have to include both R and A? We don't have to, but including them might help? Actually, we know both R and A are present. If we don't include them, we might get feedback that doesn't tell us about their positions? So we should try to include known letters to pin down their positions.

 Therefore, I think we should include both R and A.

 Let me prioritize including R and A in new positions.

 Possibilities:
  R in position 1: words like R__?__ 
      R A ? ? ? : but also avoid position 3 for A? So A must be in 4th or 5th? Or position 2? 
      Example: ""RADIO""? -> R, A, D, I, O -> but A in position 2? That's okay? And avoid C,N,E? 
          Also, we don't have any restrictions for the other letters? 
      So ""RADIO"": 
        - R at 1: allowed 
        - A at 2: allowed? We don't know? Only 3rd is forbidden? So 2nd is open.
        - D, I, O are new.

  Alternatively, ""RASPY"": 
      R, A, S, P, Y 
      R at 1, A at 2 -> avoids C,N,E? 
      But same position for A? Well, position 2 is allowed? But what about R? Position 1 is allowed? 

  However, we also need to consider that we don't know if A can be at position 2? So we try?

 But note: the feedback only said A is not in the 3rd. It might very well be in the 2nd? So we can try.

 But also, we know R cannot be in the 2nd? And we are putting R in 1st? That's a new position? Good.

 However, let's check for other common words: ""PARTY"" -> P, A, R, T, Y -> 
   Positions: 
     A at 2nd -> allowed
     R at 3rd -> allowed (because only 2nd is bad so far)
   But R at 3rd? We don't know? So that could be? 

 Compare: we have two known letters R and A, and we want to test them in positions we haven't tried? 
  For R, we only tried position 2? So now we can try position 1,3,4, or 5? 
  Similarly for A: we only tried position 3? So we can try 1,2,4,5.

 We also want to maximize new letter information.

 Perhaps ""PARTY"" is a good candidate? 
   Letters: P, A, R, T, Y -> all new? 

 But note: in ""crane"", we didn't have P, T, Y? So that would introduce three new letters? And also use R and A.

 However, in ""PARTY"": 
   Position1: P -> new
   Position2: A -> testing if A is there? 
   Position3: R -> testing if R is in 3rd? 
   Position4: T -> new
   Position5: Y -> new

 But wait: we have R and A both in the word? And we are testing R at 3rd and A at 2nd? Which are both allowed? 

 Alternatively, what about ""RABBI""? -> but that has repeated letters? And we don't know if repeated letters are in the word? Also, we should avoid repeats? Not necessary, but might be inefficient? But let's choose words with unique letters? 

 Also, ""RABBI"" is not common? and has B and I? But also allows A in 2nd? 

 Actually, we want to use distinct letters? Because if there are repeated letters we might get less information? 

 So let's aim for distinct letters.

 Therefore, ""RADIO"" and ""PARTY"" and ""RASPY"" are candidates? 

 But note: in the secret word, we don't know if there are repeated letters? So we could avoid repeating? And since the feedback doesn't indicate repetition? So we can assume distinct? 

 Now, to decide: we want to cover more common vowels and consonants? 

 Common vowels: A, O, I? We already have O and I in ""RADIO""? 

 Common consonants: S, T, R? We have R and T and S? 

 How about ""RAINS""? -> but N was disallowed? Because in first guess N was marked x? So not in word? So ""RAINS"" invalid? 

 Similarly, ""CARES"" -> C is disallowed? 

 So best candidate: ""RADIO"" vs ""PARTY"" vs ""RASPY""

 Let me pick ""PARTY"" because it has R and A in two new positions? And also introduces P, T, Y? 

 Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" is invalid because if we put R in 2nd -> which we know is wrong? 

 How about ""ROAST""? 
   We decided against because A is in 3rd? We know A is not in 3rd? So why repeat? 

 Therefore, I think ""PARTY"" is a good choice.

 But what about the word ""PARKS""? 
   P, A, R, K, S -> A in 2nd? R in 3rd? Both allowed? And K and S are new? 

 Also good? 

 Maybe I'll choose a word that doesn't have R and A adjacent? 

 Another candidate: ""FLAIR""? 
   F, L, A, I, R -> 
   A in position 3? But wait, we know A is not in position 3? So we cannot put A in 3rd? 

 Therefore, ""FLAIR"" is invalid? 

 How about ""STAIR""? 
   S, T, A, I, R -> 
   A in position 3 -> forbidden? So invalid.

 Alternative: ""ARTIS""? Wait, ARTIS is not a word? 

 Let me pick a word: ""GRAPY""? Not a word.

 How about ""BRAVE""? 
   But B, R, A, V, E -> E is disallowed? 

 ""FRAME"": has E? 

 ""GLARE"": has E? 

 ""SHARP"": 
   S, H, A, R, P -> 
   Position1: S
   Position2: H
   Position3: A -> but we cannot put A in 3rd? So invalid.

 ""HORDE"": has E? 

 ""AMBER"": has E? 

 ""PLAIN"": has N? disallowed.

 So back to: ""RASPY"", ""RADIO"", ""PARTY"", ""PARKS"".

 I think ""RADIO"" and ""PARTY"" are both good? 
  ""RADIO"": A in 2nd and R in 1st? 
  ""PARTY"": A in 2nd and R in 3rd? 

 Which one? 
  For ""RADIO"": 
    If the word has R in 1st, we get a ✓ for R? 
    And A in 2nd, could it be? 

  For ""PARTY"": 
    A in 2nd and R in 3rd? 

 Actually, we don't know? 

 Another factor: We want to include common letters that we haven't tried? 
  First guess ""CRANE"" tested: C, R, A, N, E -> we know about R and A.

  Therefore, we should introduce letters that aren't excluded: so letters like S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

  In ""RADIO"": D and I and O? 
  In ""PARTY"": P, T, Y? 

 Common letters: T appears in a lot of words? So maybe including T is better? 

 Also, note: we know the word doesn't have C, N, E? So we can use T? 

 I think ""PARTY"" is a good choice? 

 Alternatively, ""RUSTY"": 
   R, U, S, T, Y -> 
   R in 1st? 
   But A? We must include A? No, we don't have A? We know A is in the word, so if we don't include A, we won't get information about A's position? Then we'll have to guess it later? However, by including we can get feedback on A? 

 But note: we already know A is in the word? Yes, so if we don't include it, then the feedback won't tell us anything about its position? So we might have to try again later? It's better to use it? 

 Therefore, we must include A? Actually, no, we are not forced? But it's recommended? 

 We have 6 guesses? And we might get information? So let's include both R and A? 

 Therefore, I'll go with ""PARTY"".

 Guess: ""party""After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)), we know:
- R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- C, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- We need a new guess that includes R and A in positions other than 2 (for R) and 3 (for A), while avoiding C, N, E.

For an optimal second guess:
- Include R and A in untried positions to locate them (e.g., try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5, and A in 1, 2, 4, or 5).

- Avoid repeating the ineffective positions from the first guess.

""party"" fits perfectly:
- P, T, Y are new untested letters.
- A is placed in position 2 (untried, since only position 3 was ruled out).
- R is placed in position 3 (untried, since only position 2 was ruled out).
- Uses distinct letters and excludes known absent letters (C, N, E).

This guess maximizes letter coverage and position testing for R and A.

Make sure to include R and A (since we know they are in the word).\n 2. Avoid using any of the letters that are not present: C, N, E.\n 3. We can use other letters that are common to get more information.\n\n Let\'s think of words that contain R and A, but not C, N, E.\n\n Also, note that the word must be 5 letters.\n\n We must avoid placing R and A in the positions that are already known to be wrong for them?\n Actually, for R: we guessed it in position 2 and it was wrong, but we don\'t know where it belongs. Similarly for A.\n\n However, we should try a word where R and A are in different positions than before.\n\n Common positions to try:\n Since R was excluded from position 2, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n Similarly, A should not be in position 3, so we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n We don\'t know the positions, so we can experiment.\n\n Also, we should introduce new letters to get more information.\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.\n\n We want to cover multiple common letters.\n\n Let\'s brainstorm words that include R and A, and three new letters, excluding C, N, E.\n\n Possible words: \n - ""RATIO"": has R, A, T, I, O -> good letters? But note: R is in position 1 (different from before) and A in 2 (which was not the 3rd, so allowed). However, we don\'t know if A can be in 2nd? Feedback didn\'t say anything about A in 2nd? Yes, we can try.\n\n But note: We must avoid placing R in the 2nd? Actually we guessed R in 2nd and it was wrong, but that doesn\'t mean we cannot put R in 2nd in a future guess? Wait, no: because the feedback said that R is in the word but not in the 2nd position. So we must avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we are allowed to guess R in position 2 again? But we know it\'s wrong, so it would be inefficient.\n\n For our next guess, we should not put R in the 2nd position because we know it doesn\'t belong there. Similarly, A should not be put in the 3rd.\n\n So for ""RATIO"":\n  position1: R -> might be correct? possible.\n  position2: A -> not forbidden for A? Only forbidden was position 3 for A? So yes, we can try A in 2.\n\n But the secret word might have R in a different position? We know R is not in 2nd, but we don\'t know about A: it might be in 2nd? We need to check.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"": but note that we must avoid E and N and C? \n  ""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T -> avoids C, N, E. \n  R in 1st, which is allowed (since we only know 2nd is bad for R). \n  A in 3rd? Wait, our feedback said A is not in the 3rd? So we cannot put A in 3rd? Because we already know that A is present but not in 3rd. So if we guess ""ROAST"", we would put A in 3rd again? That would be inefficient because we know it should be elsewhere.\n\n Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the 3rd position for this new guess.\n\n Let me think of words that have A and R, and don\'t have C, N, E, and avoid placing A at position 3 and R at position 2.\n\n Also, we haven\'t tried S, T, O, etc.\n\n How about ""STAMP""? \n  - S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but wait, we must avoid A at position 3? So we cannot use A in position 3. \n  So ""STAMP"" is invalid for our guess because it puts A at 3rd which we know is wrong.\n\n What about ""PARTS""?\n  P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, T at 4, S at 5.\n  - A is in 2nd: that\'s okay (since we don\'t know anything about position 2 for A? Only that 3rd is wrong). \n  - R is in 3rd: that\'s okay? Because we only know R was wrong in 2nd? So R in 3rd is a new position? Yes.\n\n Let me check: \n  Position for R: not in 2nd -> so we can put R in 1,3,4,5.\n  Position for A: not in 3rd -> so we can put A in 1,2,4,5.\n\n So ""PARTS"": \n  A is in position 2: allowed.\n  R is in position 3: allowed.\n\n And it avoids C, N, E.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""TRAIL"": \n   T, R, A, I, L \n   R in position 2 -> but wait, we know R is not in position 2? So that would be inefficient. Therefore, avoid placing R in position 2.\n\n Therefore, words that have R in 2nd should be avoided? Yes.\n\n Other ideas: ""RAPID"", ""BARES"" (but B is new?), ""RASPY"", ""GRAPE"" (but E is disallowed? because we know E is not in the word? Yes, E is disallowed).\n\n So ""GRAPE"" is invalid because of E.\n\n How about ""DRAWL""? \n   D, R, A, W, L -> avoids C,N,E? \n   R is in 2nd -> avoid? Because we know R is not in 2nd? So don\'t use that.\n\n Alternatively, ""ARGUE""? \n   A, R, G, U, E -> but E is disallowed? Yes, we cannot use E.\n\n Another word: ""ORBIT""? \n   O, R, B, I, T -> but doesn\'t include A? We must include A because we know it\'s in the word? No, we have to include both R and A? We don\'t have to, but including them might help? Actually, we know both R and A are present. If we don\'t include them, we might get feedback that doesn\'t tell us about their positions? So we should try to include known letters to pin down their positions.\n\n Therefore, I think we should include both R and A.\n\n Let me prioritize including R and A in new positions.\n\n Possibilities:\n  R in position 1: words like R__?__ \n      R A ? ? ? : but also avoid position 3 for A? So A must be in 4th or 5th? Or position 2? \n      Example: ""RADIO""? -> R, A, D, I, O -> but A in position 2? That\'s okay? And avoid C,N,E? \n          Also, we don\'t have any restrictions for the other letters? \n      So ""RADIO"": \n        - R at 1: allowed \n        - A at 2: allowed? We don\'t know? Only 3rd is forbidden? So 2nd is open.\n        - D, I, O are new.\n\n  Alternatively, ""RASPY"": \n      R, A, S, P, Y \n      R at 1, A at 2 -> avoids C,N,E? \n      But same position for A? Well, position 2 is allowed? But what about R? Position 1 is allowed? \n\n  However, we also need to consider that we don\'t know if A can be at position 2? So we try?\n\n But note: the feedback only said A is not in the 3rd. It might very well be in the 2nd? So we can try.\n\n But also, we know R cannot be in the 2nd? And we are putting R in 1st? That\'s a new position? Good.\n\n However, let\'s check for other common words: ""PARTY"" -> P, A, R, T, Y -> \n   Positions: \n     A at 2nd -> allowed\n     R at 3rd -> allowed (because only 2nd is bad so far)\n   But R at 3rd? We don\'t know? So that could be? \n\n Compare: we have two known letters R and A, and we want to test them in positions we haven\'t tried? \n  For R, we only tried position 2? So now we can try position 1,3,4, or 5? \n  Similarly for A: we only tried position 3? So we can try 1,2,4,5.\n\n We also want to maximize new letter information.\n\n Perhaps ""PARTY"" is a good candidate? \n   Letters: P, A, R, T, Y -> all new? \n\n But note: in ""crane"", we didn\'t have P, T, Y? So that would introduce three new letters? And also use R and A.\n\n However, in ""PARTY"": \n   Position1: P -> new\n   Position2: A -> testing if A is there? \n   Position3: R -> testing if R is in 3rd? \n   Position4: T -> new\n   Position5: Y -> new\n\n But wait: we have R and A both in the word? And we are testing R at 3rd and A at 2nd? Which are both allowed? \n\n Alternatively, what about ""RABBI""? -> but that has repeated letters? And we don\'t know if repeated letters are in the word? Also, we should avoid repeats? Not necessary, but might be inefficient? But let\'s choose words with unique letters? \n\n Also, ""RABBI"" is not common? and has B and I? But also allows A in 2nd? \n\n Actually, we want to use distinct letters? Because if there are repeated letters we might get less information? \n\n So let\'s aim for distinct letters.\n\n Therefore, ""RADIO"" and ""PARTY"" and ""RASPY"" are candidates? \n\n But note: in the secret word, we don\'t know if there are repeated letters? So we could avoid repeating? And since the feedback doesn\'t indicate repetition? So we can assume distinct? \n\n Now, to decide: we want to cover more common vowels and consonants? \n\n Common vowels: A, O, I? We already have O and I in ""RADIO""? \n\n Common consonants: S, T, R? We have R and T and S? \n\n How about ""RAINS""? -> but N was disallowed? Because in first guess N was marked x? So not in word? So ""RAINS"" invalid? \n\n Similarly, ""CARES"" -> C is disallowed? \n\n So best candidate: ""RADIO"" vs ""PARTY"" vs ""RASPY""\n\n Let me pick ""PARTY"" because it has R and A in two new positions? And also introduces P, T, Y? \n\n Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" is invalid because if we put R in 2nd -> which we know is wrong? \n\n How about ""ROAST""? \n   We decided against because A is in 3rd? We know A is not in 3rd? So why repeat? \n\n Therefore, I think ""PARTY"" is a good choice.\n\n But what about the word ""PARKS""? \n   P, A, R, K, S -> A in 2nd? R in 3rd? Both allowed? And K and S are new? \n\n Also good? \n\n Maybe I\'ll choose a word that doesn\'t have R and A adjacent? \n\n Another candidate: ""FLAIR""? \n   F, L, A, I, R -> \n   A in position 3? But wait, we know A is not in position 3? So we cannot put A in 3rd? \n\n Therefore, ""FLAIR"" is invalid? \n\n How about ""STAIR""? \n   S, T, A, I, R -> \n   A in position 3 -> forbidden? So invalid.\n\n Alternative: ""ARTIS""? Wait, ARTIS is not a word? \n\n Let me pick a word: ""GRAPY""? Not a word.\n\n How about ""BRAVE""? \n   But B, R, A, V, E -> E is disallowed? \n\n ""FRAME"": has E? \n\n ""GLARE"": has E? \n\n ""SHARP"": \n   S, H, A, R, P -> \n   Position1: S\n   Position2: H\n   Position3: A -> but we cannot put A in 3rd? So invalid.\n\n ""HORDE"": has E? \n\n ""AMBER"": has E? \n\n ""PLAIN"": has N? disallowed.\n\n So back to: ""RASPY"", ""RADIO"", ""PARTY"", ""PARKS"".\n\n I think ""RADIO"" and ""PARTY"" are both good? \n  ""RADIO"": A in 2nd and R in 1st? \n  ""PARTY"": A in 2nd and R in 3rd? \n\n Which one? \n  For ""RADIO"": \n    If the word has R in 1st, we get a ✓ for R? \n    And A in 2nd, could it be? \n\n  For ""PARTY"": \n    A in 2nd and R in 3rd? \n\n Actually, we don\'t know? \n\n Another factor: We want to include common letters that we haven\'t tried? \n  First guess ""CRANE"" tested: C, R, A, N, E -> we know about R and A.\n\n  Therefore, we should introduce letters that aren\'t excluded: so letters like S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.\n\n  In ""RADIO"": D and I and O? \n  In ""PARTY"": P, T, Y? \n\n Common letters: T appears in a lot of words? So maybe including T is better? \n\n Also, note: we know the word doesn\'t have C, N, E? So we can use T? \n\n I think ""PARTY"" is a good choice? \n\n Alternatively, ""RUSTY"": \n   R, U, S, T, Y -> \n   R in 1st? \n   But A? We must include A? No, we don\'t have A? We know A is in the word, so if we don\'t include A, we won\'t get information about A\'s position? Then we\'ll have to guess it later? However, by including we can get feedback on A? \n\n But note: we already know A is in the word? Yes, so if we don\'t include it, then the feedback won\'t tell us anything about its position? So we might have to try again later? It\'s better to use it? \n\n Therefore, we must include A? Actually, no, we are not forced? But it\'s recommended? \n\n We have 6 guesses? And we might get information? So let\'s include both R and A? \n\n Therefore, I\'ll go with ""PARTY"".\n\n Guess: ""party""After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)), we know:\n- R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.\n- C, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.\n- We need a new guess that includes R and A in positions other than 2 (for R) and 3 (for A), while avoiding C, N, E.\n\nFor an optimal second guess:\n- Include R and A in untried positions to locate them (e.g., try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5, and A in 1, 2, 4, or 5).\n- Introduce new common letters like T, P, and Y to gather more information.\n- Avoid repeating the ineffective positions from the first guess.\n\n""party"" fits perfectly:\n- P, T, Y are new untested letters.\n- A is placed in position 2 (untried, since only position 3 was ruled out).\n- R is placed in position 3 (untried, since only position 2 was ruled out).\n- Uses distinct letters and excludes known absent letters (C, N, E).\n\nThis guess maximizes letter coverage and position testing for R and A.\n\n<guess>party</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(-) T(x) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Guess 2: party -> P(x), A(✓), R(-), T(x), Y(x)

Interpretation:

From Guess 1:
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was marked '-' meaning wrong position).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked '-' meaning wrong position).
- C, N, E are not in the word.

From Guess 2:
- A is correct in position 2 (marked '✓'). So the second letter of the secret word is A.
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and marked '-' wrong position).
- P, T, Y are not in the word.

Additionally, from Guess 1, we know R is in the word but not in position 2. Now from Guess 2, R is also not in position 3. So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

Also, note that the secret word has the second letter as A.

Known absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, Y.

Known present letters: R (position unknown, but not 2 or 3), and A (fixed at position 2).

So the secret word pattern is: _ A _ _ _

We know R must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5? Actually: 
- If R were in position 1, we did not test position 1? In Guess 1, we had R at position 2? So we haven't tested position 1? 
But in Guess 2, we didn't have any letter at position 1? We had P at 1? That was absent? 

We need to find a word that:
- Has the second letter 'A'.
- Includes R (since R is present) in either position 1, 4, or 5? Note: we cannot put R in 2nd because it's A? And we cannot put R in 3rd? Because in Guess 2 we tried and it was wrong? So 1,4,5 are open? 
- Also, avoid the absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, Y.

Now, we need more letters? So we should choose a word that has R in position 1, 4 or 5? And introduce new letters? 

We also should avoid placing R in positions that we know are wrong? Which we have? 

But note: we haven't tested position 1 at all? We put C in Guess 1? But C was absent? So position 1 is unknown? Similarly, positions 4 and 5: we tried N then Y? Both absent? 

So for our third guess, we can try R in any of positions 1, 4, or 5? But we need to cover more letters? 

Let me think: since A is fixed at position 2, the word must be: ? A ? ? ?

We know R must be at 1, 4, or 5? 

And we avoid: C, E, N, P, T, Y? 

What are available letters? 
We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z? 

Common ones: B, D, I, S, O? 

We need a word that has the pattern ?A???, and includes R? And avoids the banned letters? 

Also, note: we don't know if there are any repeated letters? But let's assume we avoid? 

Now, if we put R at position 1: then the word becomes R A ? ? ? 
Then we have to fill the last three? 

Possible words: ""RABID"", but B? but D? 
But ""RABID"": R, A, B, I, D -> letters? 
Also, ""RABID"" has B, I, D? 

But note: in the positions? 
Position 3: B? We don't know?
Position 4: I?
Position 5: D?

Also, let me check if that avoids banned letters? C,E,N,P,T,Y? Yes? 

But is it valid? 

Alternatively: ""RADIO""? But O? But note: we have position 4: I? And position 5: O? 
But we haven't tried these letters? 

But wait, in the first guess, we had A and R? But we already know A? So we can try? 

But note: in Guess 2, we got A in the correct position? So now let me think of words? 

But what if R is in position 1? 

Another option: ""RAGAS""? but repeated A? And invalid? 

How about ""RAVES""? But E? E is disallowed? 

""RAINS""? But N? disallowed.

Another idea: ""RALES""? but has E? disallowed.

""SALAD""? but S? but S hasn't been tried? But also, we have A at position 2? So the word must be ?A???. 
If we put R at position 1: then words beginning with RA? 

But also: we could put R at position 4? That is, ? A ? R ? 
Or position 5? ? A ? ? R? 

But we don't know? 

So we need to test? 

How about we try R in position 1? Since it hasn't been tested? 

But also: we can choose a word that has R at 1, and includes other new letters? 

But note: if R is in position 1, then in Guess1 we had R in 2nd? And we got R present? So why wasn't R marked as present due to position 1? Because in Guess1 there was no R at position 1? So it might be? 

Alternatively, if R is at position 4? Then in Guess1? We had R in position 2? Which doesn't conflict? 

Similarly, position 5? 

But since we are going to test? 

But we can also choose a word that tests multiple possibilities? 

However, with the constraint that A is fixed? 

Common words that fit: 
- ""RABID"": R at 1, A at 2? 
  Then unknown B, I, D? 

But not very common? 

How about ""RADII""? repeated I? and not common? 

""RASPS""? But P and S? P? but we know P is absent? P is banned? 

From Guess 2, P is absent? So we cannot use P? 

Similarly, we cannot use T? 

So letters banned: C,E,N,P,T,Y? 

Therefore, ""RABID"" is acceptable? 

But perhaps we can try a more common word? 

How about ""RAILS""? 
   R, A, I, L, S?
   But position 1: R, position 2: A, position 3: I, position 4: L, position 5: S? 
   But we haven't tried I,L,S? 
   And avoid C,E,N,P,T,Y? Yes? 

But ""RAILS"" is a word? 

Also, we could test R at 1? 

Similarly, we can test R at 4? Or 5? 

But I think testing R at 1? Since we might get full word? 

Also, having S and L might be helpful? 

But note: if we put R in position 1, and the secret word has R at 1? Then we get ✓ for R? 

Otherwise, if R is not at 1, then we might get R marked as '-' if it is at 4 or 5? 

So it helps pin down R's position? 

Therefore, I think ""RAILS"" is a good candidate? 

But wait? Another possibility: ""BAKER""? But E? not allowed? 

Or ""DANCE""? N? not allowed? 

So let me go with ""RAILS"".

But what if R is not at 1? Then we will get R marked as absent? But no? Because R is definitely in the word? So if we put R at 1? Then:
- If R is at 1: then ✓
- If R is not at 1? But since we have it? Then R should be marked as '-' meaning it's present but in wrong position? 

Because R is present? So we cannot get R marked as 'x'? Because we know R is present? So if we put R at 1? And R is actually at 4? Then we will get R marked as '-' meaning present but wrong position? 

And similarly? 

So in any case, we get information about R's position? 

Therefore, ""RAILS"" is a valid guess: 
  Positions: 
    1: R? 
    2: A? Correct? 
    3: I? 
    4: L? 
    5: S? 

But wait? position 2: A is fixed? So A will be correct? 

And we haven't tested I, L, S? 

Alternatively, if we think R might be at 4? Then we can try a word with R at 4? And another common letter? 

For example: ""DAILY""? 
  D, A, I, L, Y? 
  But Y is disallowed? From Guess2? 

Because Y in Guess2 was absent? So we cannot use Y? 

Another one: ""MAILS""? 
  M, A, I, L, S? 
  Then we don't use R? But we must use R? Because we haven't tested R in positions 4 or 5? 

We know R is present? So we should include it? So we must include R? 

Therefore, we need to use R in the guess? 

But if we put R at 4? Then word: ? A ? R ? 

For instance: ""SAVOR""? 
  But V and O? 
  But also S? 
  But avoid banned? 

But we cannot test without R? 

So to test R at 4? We try: ""BARREL""? not 5? 

Words: ""HAREM""? But E? disallowed? 

""CAROM""? C? disallowed? 

""ARMOR""? R repeated? 

""FARMS""? 
  F, A, R, M, S? 
  Then: position1: F? 
  position2: A? 
  position3: R? But wait? We know R is not in position 3? Because Guess2 had R at 3 and got '-', meaning R is not at 3? 

So how can we put R at 3? We cannot? 

So for position4: R? 
Then the word: ? A ? R ? 

Need a letter at position1, position3, position5? 

For example: ""HAIRY""? But Y? disallowed? 

""GAUDY""? G,A,U,D,Y? Y disallowed? 

""BASIC""? C disallowed? 

""VALID""? V,A,L,I,D? 
But no R? 

So difficult? 

But we know R must be included? 

Therefore, we can try R at position1? Or position4? Or position5? 

How about R at position4? Then: 
  Words: ...R 
  Positions: 
    1: some letter? 
    2: A? 
    3: some letter? 
    4: R? 
    5: some letter? 

Example: ""OARED""? has E? 

""FARES""? has E? 

""DARES""? has E? 

""LARKS""? 
  L, A, R, K, S? 
  Position1: L? 
  Position2: A? 
  Position3: R? But wait, position3? We know R cannot be in position3? Because Guess2 had R at 3 and it was marked as '-' meaning R is not at 3? 

In ""LARKS"": R is at position3? Which we know is impossible? 

So we cannot put R at position3? 

Therefore, any word that has R at position3? Would be inefficient? 

Similarly, word with R at position4? Then how? 

For ""FARMS"" from above? 
  F at 1, A at 2, R at 3? Oh, I see, I put R at 3 in ""FARMS""? That is invalid? We must avoid R at position3? 

Therefore, for position4? We need a word that has R at 4? 
Example: ""CHAIR""? But C? 

""PAIRS""? but P? banned? 

""HAIRS""? 
  H, A, I, R, S? 
  Then: 
    1: H? 
    2: A? 
    3: I? 
    4: R? 
    5: S? 

This avoids C,E,N,P,T,Y? 

But does ""HAIRS"" have R at 4? Yes? 

Similarly, ""FRAUD""? 
  F,R,A,U,D -> R at 1? 

But if we choose ""HAIRS"", then R is at position4? 

Similarly, position5: R? Then word: ? A ? ? R? 
Example: ""KOALA""? not? 

""SONAR""? 
  S, O, N, A, R -> but N banned? 

""SUGAR""? 
  S, U, G, A, R -> 
  1: S? 
  2: U? but why? Position2 must be A? So we need A at 2? 

Pattern: second letter must be A? 

So for position5: R? ? A ? ? R? 

Word: ? A ? ? R? 

For example: ""GLAMR""? not word? 

""FLAIR""? 
   F, L, A, I, R -> 
  1:F, 2:L? But 2 must be A? So not? 

""CHAOR""? not? 

So it's hard? 

Therefore, easier to try R at position1? 

Thus, I'll go with ""RAILS"". 

But let's confirm: 
  ""RAILS"": 
    R, A, I, L, S? 
    Positions: 
        1: R -> new? 
        2: A -> we know ✓? 
        3: I -> new? 
        4: L -> new? 
        5: S -> new? 

And it avoids banned letters? 

Yes? 

And if the secret word was ""RAILS""? We win? 

If not, we get information about R? And I, L, S? 

Alternative: ""RABID"", but similar? 

But ""RAILS"" seems common? 

Okay? 

But note: we have already used 2 guesses? Now third? 

So guess: ""rails"" or ""RAILS""? 

But let me note: in Guess2, A was fixed? So this word has A at 2? So that will be guaranteed ✓? 

So we only test R at 1 and the other letters? 

So I think it's good? 

Therefore, I choose ""rails"".

Note: we must use uppercase? But in the response we can use uppercase? 

In the feedback examples? They used uppercase? 

But in the guess output? We use lowercase? 

Or consistent? 

But I think the application expects in the <guess> tag? 

So I'll use lowercase? 

But for clarity? 

Actually, the first time I guessed ""crane"" and ""party"" in lowercase? 

So I'll use ""rails"".

But let me confirm: is ""rails"" a valid word? Yes? Railways or similar? 

So proceed? 

If we are wrong? Then feedback will help?

### Previous Feedback Analysis:
- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively.  
  - C, N, E are absent.  
- **Guess 2: party** → P(x), A(✓), R(-), T(x), Y(x)  
  - A is correct and fixed at position 2.  
  - R is present but not at position 3 (since marked ""-"").  
  - P, T, Y are absent.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `_ A _ _ _` (second letter is A).  
2. **R's position**: Must be at position 1, 4, or 5 (excludes position 2 from Guess 1 and position 3 from Guess 2).  
3. **Absent letters**: C, E, N, P, T, Y (avoid these).  
4. **Valid letters to test**: Focus on untested common letters (e.g., S, L, I, D, G, H, M, O, U) and include R in an untested position.  

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- Test R at **position 1** (since positions 4/5 aren't tested yet, but position 1 is high-priority as a starting letter).  
- Include new common letters (I, L, S) to maximize information.  
- Avoid all absent letters and maintain valid English words.  
- Choose **""rails""**:  
  - R at position 1 (tests R in a new position).  
  - A at position 2 (confirms fixed ✓).  
  - New letters: I, L, S (high-frequency consonants/vowels).  
  - Shape: `R A I L S`, avoiding all known absent letters.

<guess>rails","We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Guess 2: party -> P(x), A(✓), R(-), T(x), Y(x)

Interpretation:

From Guess 1:
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was marked '-' meaning wrong position).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked '-' meaning wrong position).
- C, N, E are not in the word.

From Guess 2:
- A is correct in position 2 (marked '✓'). So the second letter of the secret word is A.
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and marked '-' wrong position).
- P, T, Y are not in the word.

Additionally, from Guess 1, we know R is in the word but not in position 2. Now from Guess 2, R is also not in position 3. So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

Also, note that the secret word has the second letter as A.

Known absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, Y.

Known present letters: R (position unknown, but not 2 or 3), and A (fixed at position 2).

So the secret word pattern is: _ A _ _ _

We know R must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5? Actually: 
- If R were in position 1, we did not test position 1? In Guess 1, we had R at position 2? So we haven't tested position 1? 
But in Guess 2, we didn't have any letter at position 1? We had P at 1? That was absent? 

We need to find a word that:
- Has the second letter 'A'.
- Includes R (since R is present) in either position 1, 4, or 5? Note: we cannot put R in 2nd because it's A? And we cannot put R in 3rd? Because in Guess 2 we tried and it was wrong? So 1,4,5 are open? 
- Also, avoid the absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, Y.

Now, we need more letters? So we should choose a word that has R in position 1, 4 or 5? And introduce new letters? 

We also should avoid placing R in positions that we know are wrong? Which we have? 

But note: we haven't tested position 1 at all? We put C in Guess 1? But C was absent? So position 1 is unknown? Similarly, positions 4 and 5: we tried N then Y? Both absent? 

So for our third guess, we can try R in any of positions 1, 4, or 5? But we need to cover more letters? 

Let me think: since A is fixed at position 2, the word must be: ? A ? ? ?

We know R must be at 1, 4, or 5? 

And we avoid: C, E, N, P, T, Y? 

What are available letters? 
We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z? 

Common ones: B, D, I, S, O? 

We need a word that has the pattern ?A???, and includes R? And avoids the banned letters? 

Also, note: we don't know if there are any repeated letters? But let's assume we avoid? 

Now, if we put R at position 1: then the word becomes R A ? ? ? 
Then we have to fill the last three? 

Possible words: ""RABID"", but B? but D? 
But ""RABID"": R, A, B, I, D -> letters? 
Also, ""RABID"" has B, I, D? 

But note: in the positions? 
Position 3: B? We don't know?
Position 4: I?
Position 5: D?

Also, let me check if that avoids banned letters? C,E,N,P,T,Y? Yes? 

But is it valid? 

Alternatively: ""RADIO""? But O? But note: we have position 4: I? And position 5: O? 
But we haven't tried these letters? 

But wait, in the first guess, we had A and R? But we already know A? So we can try? 

But note: in Guess 2, we got A in the correct position? So now let me think of words? 

But what if R is in position 1? 

Another option: ""RAGAS""? but repeated A? And invalid? 

How about ""RAVES""? But E? E is disallowed? 

""RAINS""? But N? disallowed.

Another idea: ""RALES""? but has E? disallowed.

""SALAD""? but S? but S hasn't been tried? But also, we have A at position 2? So the word must be ?A???. 
If we put R at position 1: then words beginning with RA? 

But also: we could put R at position 4? That is, ? A ? R ? 
Or position 5? ? A ? ? R? 

But we don't know? 

So we need to test? 

How about we try R in position 1? Since it hasn't been tested? 

But also: we can choose a word that has R at 1, and includes other new letters? 

But note: if R is in position 1, then in Guess1 we had R in 2nd? And we got R present? So why wasn't R marked as present due to position 1? Because in Guess1 there was no R at position 1? So it might be? 

Alternatively, if R is at position 4? Then in Guess1? We had R in position 2? Which doesn't conflict? 

Similarly, position 5? 

But since we are going to test? 

But we can also choose a word that tests multiple possibilities? 

However, with the constraint that A is fixed? 

Common words that fit: 
- ""RABID"": R at 1, A at 2? 
  Then unknown B, I, D? 

But not very common? 

How about ""RADII""? repeated I? and not common? 

""RASPS""? But P and S? P? but we know P is absent? P is banned? 

From Guess 2, P is absent? So we cannot use P? 

Similarly, we cannot use T? 

So letters banned: C,E,N,P,T,Y? 

Therefore, ""RABID"" is acceptable? 

But perhaps we can try a more common word? 

How about ""RAILS""? 
   R, A, I, L, S?
   But position 1: R, position 2: A, position 3: I, position 4: L, position 5: S? 
   But we haven't tried I,L,S? 
   And avoid C,E,N,P,T,Y? Yes? 

But ""RAILS"" is a word? 

Also, we could test R at 1? 

Similarly, we can test R at 4? Or 5? 

But I think testing R at 1? Since we might get full word? 

Also, having S and L might be helpful? 

But note: if we put R in position 1, and the secret word has R at 1? Then we get ✓ for R? 

Otherwise, if R is not at 1, then we might get R marked as '-' if it is at 4 or 5? 

So it helps pin down R's position? 

Therefore, I think ""RAILS"" is a good candidate? 

But wait? Another possibility: ""BAKER""? But E? not allowed? 

Or ""DANCE""? N? not allowed? 

So let me go with ""RAILS"".

But what if R is not at 1? Then we will get R marked as absent? But no? Because R is definitely in the word? So if we put R at 1? Then:
- If R is at 1: then ✓
- If R is not at 1? But since we have it? Then R should be marked as '-' meaning it's present but in wrong position? 

Because R is present? So we cannot get R marked as 'x'? Because we know R is present? So if we put R at 1? And R is actually at 4? Then we will get R marked as '-' meaning present but wrong position? 

And similarly? 

So in any case, we get information about R's position? 

Therefore, ""RAILS"" is a valid guess: 
  Positions: 
    1: R? 
    2: A? Correct? 
    3: I? 
    4: L? 
    5: S? 

But wait? position 2: A is fixed? So A will be correct? 

And we haven't tested I, L, S? 

Alternatively, if we think R might be at 4? Then we can try a word with R at 4? And another common letter? 

For example: ""DAILY""? 
  D, A, I, L, Y? 
  But Y is disallowed? From Guess2? 

Because Y in Guess2 was absent? So we cannot use Y? 

Another one: ""MAILS""? 
  M, A, I, L, S? 
  Then we don't use R? But we must use R? Because we haven't tested R in positions 4 or 5? 

We know R is present? So we should include it? So we must include R? 

Therefore, we need to use R in the guess? 

But if we put R at 4? Then word: ? A ? R ? 

For instance: ""SAVOR""? 
  But V and O? 
  But also S? 
  But avoid banned? 

But we cannot test without R? 

So to test R at 4? We try: ""BARREL""? not 5? 

Words: ""HAREM""? But E? disallowed? 

""CAROM""? C? disallowed? 

""ARMOR""? R repeated? 

""FARMS""? 
  F, A, R, M, S? 
  Then: position1: F? 
  position2: A? 
  position3: R? But wait? We know R is not in position 3? Because Guess2 had R at 3 and got '-', meaning R is not at 3? 

So how can we put R at 3? We cannot? 

So for position4: R? 
Then the word: ? A ? R ? 

Need a letter at position1, position3, position5? 

For example: ""HAIRY""? But Y? disallowed? 

""GAUDY""? G,A,U,D,Y? Y disallowed? 

""BASIC""? C disallowed? 

""VALID""? V,A,L,I,D? 
But no R? 

So difficult? 

But we know R must be included? 

Therefore, we can try R at position1? Or position4? Or position5? 

How about R at position4? Then: 
  Words: ...R 
  Positions: 
    1: some letter? 
    2: A? 
    3: some letter? 
    4: R? 
    5: some letter? 

Example: ""OARED""? has E? 

""FARES""? has E? 

""DARES""? has E? 

""LARKS""? 
  L, A, R, K, S? 
  Position1: L? 
  Position2: A? 
  Position3: R? But wait, position3? We know R cannot be in position3? Because Guess2 had R at 3 and it was marked as '-' meaning R is not at 3? 

In ""LARKS"": R is at position3? Which we know is impossible? 

So we cannot put R at position3? 

Therefore, any word that has R at position3? Would be inefficient? 

Similarly, word with R at position4? Then how? 

For ""FARMS"" from above? 
  F at 1, A at 2, R at 3? Oh, I see, I put R at 3 in ""FARMS""? That is invalid? We must avoid R at position3? 

Therefore, for position4? We need a word that has R at 4? 
Example: ""CHAIR""? But C? 

""PAIRS""? but P? banned? 

""HAIRS""? 
  H, A, I, R, S? 
  Then: 
    1: H? 
    2: A? 
    3: I? 
    4: R? 
    5: S? 

This avoids C,E,N,P,T,Y? 

But does ""HAIRS"" have R at 4? Yes? 

Similarly, ""FRAUD""? 
  F,R,A,U,D -> R at 1? 

But if we choose ""HAIRS"", then R is at position4? 

Similarly, position5: R? Then word: ? A ? ? R? 
Example: ""KOALA""? not? 

""SONAR""? 
  S, O, N, A, R -> but N banned? 

""SUGAR""? 
  S, U, G, A, R -> 
  1: S? 
  2: U? but why? Position2 must be A? So we need A at 2? 

Pattern: second letter must be A? 

So for position5: R? ? A ? ? R? 

Word: ? A ? ? R? 

For example: ""GLAMR""? not word? 

""FLAIR""? 
   F, L, A, I, R -> 
  1:F, 2:L? But 2 must be A? So not? 

""CHAOR""? not? 

So it's hard? 

Therefore, easier to try R at position1? 

Thus, I'll go with ""RAILS"". 

But let's confirm: 
  ""RAILS"": 
    R, A, I, L, S? 
    Positions: 
        1: R -> new? 
        2: A -> we know ✓? 
        3: I -> new? 
        4: L -> new? 
        5: S -> new? 

And it avoids banned letters? 

Yes? 

And if the secret word was ""RAILS""? We win? 

If not, we get information about R? And I, L, S? 

Alternative: ""RABID"", but similar? 

But ""RAILS"" seems common? 

Okay? 

But note: we have already used 2 guesses? Now third? 

So guess: ""rails"" or ""RAILS""? 

But let me note: in Guess2, A was fixed? So this word has A at 2? So that will be guaranteed ✓? 

So we only test R at 1 and the other letters? 

So I think it's good? 

Therefore, I choose ""rails"".

Note: we must use uppercase? But in the response we can use uppercase? 

In the feedback examples? They used uppercase? 

But in the guess output? We use lowercase? 

Or consistent? 

But I think the application expects in the <guess> tag? 

So I'll use lowercase? 

But for clarity? 

Actually, the first time I guessed ""crane"" and ""party"" in lowercase? 

So I'll use ""rails"".

But let me confirm: is ""rails"" a valid word? Yes? Railways or similar?

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively.  
  - C, N, E are absent.  
- **Guess 2: party** → P(x), A(✓), R(-), T(x), Y(x)  
  - A is correct and fixed at position 2.  
  - R is present but not at position 3 (since marked ""-"").  
  - P, T, Y are absent.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `_ A _ _ _` (second letter is A).  
2. **R's position**: Must be at position 1, 4, or 5 (excludes position 2 from Guess 1 and position 3 from Guess 2).

4. **Valid letters to test**: Focus on untested common letters (e.g., S, L, I, D, G, H, M, O, U) and include R in an untested position.  

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- Test R at **position 1** (since positions 4/5 aren't tested yet, but position 1 is high-priority as a starting letter).  
- Include new common letters (I, L, S) to maximize information.

<guess>rails -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.",FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,SAVOR,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for our first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C and N and E are not in the word at all.
 - R is in the word but not in the position we guessed (which was the 2nd position).
 - A is in the word but not in the position we guessed (which was the 3rd position).

 So the secret word contains R and A, but not C, N, E.

 Also, since R and A are present, but not in the positions we guessed, we know:
 - R cannot be in the 2nd position (but must be in some other position: 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th).
 - A cannot be in the 3rd position (but must be in some other position: 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th).

 Additionally, the secret word does not contain: C, N, E.

 For our next guess, we should:
 1. Make sure to include R and A (since we know they are in the word).
 2. Avoid using any of the letters that are not present: C, N, E.
 3. We can use other letters that are common to get more information.

 Let's think of words that contain R and A, but not C, N, E.

 Also, note that the word must be 5 letters.

 We must avoid placing R and A in the positions that are already known to be wrong for them?
 Actually, for R: we guessed it in position 2 and it was wrong, but we don't know where it belongs. Similarly for A.

 However, we should try a word where R and A are in different positions than before.

 Common positions to try:
 Since R was excluded from position 2, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, A should not be in position 3, so we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We don't know the positions, so we can experiment.

 Also, we should introduce new letters to get more information.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

 We want to cover multiple common letters.

 Let's brainstorm words that include R and A, and three new letters, excluding C, N, E.

 Possible words: 
 - ""RATIO"": has R, A, T, I, O -> good letters? But note: R is in position 1 (different from before) and A in 2 (which was not the 3rd, so allowed). However, we don't know if A can be in 2nd? Feedback didn't say anything about A in 2nd? Yes, we can try.

 But note: We must avoid placing R in the 2nd? Actually we guessed R in 2nd and it was wrong, but that doesn't mean we cannot put R in 2nd in a future guess? Wait, no: because the feedback said that R is in the word but not in the 2nd position. So we must avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we are allowed to guess R in position 2 again? But we know it's wrong, so it would be inefficient.

 For our next guess, we should not put R in the 2nd position because we know it doesn't belong there. Similarly, A should not be put in the 3rd.

 So for ""RATIO"":
  position1: R -> might be correct? possible.
  position2: A -> not forbidden for A? Only forbidden was position 3 for A? So yes, we can try A in 2.

 But the secret word might have R in a different position? We know R is not in 2nd, but we don't know about A: it might be in 2nd? We need to check.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"": but note that we must avoid E and N and C? 
  ""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T -> avoids C, N, E. 
  R in 1st, which is allowed (since we only know 2nd is bad for R). 
  A in 3rd? Wait, our feedback said A is not in the 3rd? So we cannot put A in 3rd? Because we already know that A is present but not in 3rd. So if we guess ""ROAST"", we would put A in 3rd again? That would be inefficient because we know it should be elsewhere.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the 3rd position for this new guess.

 Let me think of words that have A and R, and don't have C, N, E, and avoid placing A at position 3 and R at position 2.

 Also, we haven't tried S, T, O, etc.

 How about ""STAMP""? 
  - S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but wait, we must avoid A at position 3? So we cannot use A in position 3. 
  So ""STAMP"" is invalid for our guess because it puts A at 3rd which we know is wrong.

 What about ""PARTS""?
  P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, T at 4, S at 5.
  - A is in 2nd: that's okay (since we don't know anything about position 2 for A? Only that 3rd is wrong). 
  - R is in 3rd: that's okay? Because we only know R was wrong in 2nd? So R in 3rd is a new position? Yes.

 Let me check: 
  Position for R: not in 2nd -> so we can put R in 1,3,4,5.
  Position for A: not in 3rd -> so we can put A in 1,2,4,5.

 So ""PARTS"": 
  A is in position 2: allowed.
  R is in position 3: allowed.

 And it avoids C, N, E.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TRAIL"": 
   T, R, A, I, L 
   R in position 2 -> but wait, we know R is not in position 2? So that would be inefficient. Therefore, avoid placing R in position 2.

 Therefore, words that have R in 2nd should be avoided? Yes.

 Other ideas: ""RAPID"", ""BARES"" (but B is new?), ""RASPY"", ""GRAPE"" (but E is disallowed? because we know E is not in the word? Yes, E is disallowed).

 So ""GRAPE"" is invalid because of E.

 How about ""DRAWL""? 
   D, R, A, W, L -> avoids C,N,E? 
   R is in 2nd -> avoid? Because we know R is not in 2nd? So don't use that.

 Alternatively, ""ARGUE""? 
   A, R, G, U, E -> but E is disallowed? Yes, we cannot use E.

 Another word: ""ORBIT""? 
   O, R, B, I, T -> but doesn't include A? We must include A because we know it's in the word? No, we have to include both R and A? We don't have to, but including them might help? Actually, we know both R and A are present. If we don't include them, we might get feedback that doesn't tell us about their positions? So we should try to include known letters to pin down their positions.

 Therefore, I think we should include both R and A.

 Let me prioritize including R and A in new positions.

 Possibilities:
  R in position 1: words like R__?__ 
      R A ? ? ? : but also avoid position 3 for A? So A must be in 4th or 5th? Or position 2? 
      Example: ""RADIO""? -> R, A, D, I, O -> but A in position 2? That's okay? And avoid C,N,E? 
          Also, we don't have any restrictions for the other letters? 
      So ""RADIO"": 
        - R at 1: allowed 
        - A at 2: allowed? We don't know? Only 3rd is forbidden? So 2nd is open.
        - D, I, O are new.

  Alternatively, ""RASPY"": 
      R, A, S, P, Y 
      R at 1, A at 2 -> avoids C,N,E? 
      But same position for A? Well, position 2 is allowed? But what about R? Position 1 is allowed? 

  However, we also need to consider that we don't know if A can be at position 2? So we try?

 But note: the feedback only said A is not in the 3rd. It might very well be in the 2nd? So we can try.

 But also, we know R cannot be in the 2nd? And we are putting R in 1st? That's a new position? Good.

 However, let's check for other common words: ""PARTY"" -> P, A, R, T, Y -> 
   Positions: 
     A at 2nd -> allowed
     R at 3rd -> allowed (because only 2nd is bad so far)
   But R at 3rd? We don't know? So that could be? 

 Compare: we have two known letters R and A, and we want to test them in positions we haven't tried? 
  For R, we only tried position 2? So now we can try position 1,3,4, or 5? 
  Similarly for A: we only tried position 3? So we can try 1,2,4,5.

 We also want to maximize new letter information.

 Perhaps ""PARTY"" is a good candidate? 
   Letters: P, A, R, T, Y -> all new? 

 But note: in ""crane"", we didn't have P, T, Y? So that would introduce three new letters? And also use R and A.

 However, in ""PARTY"": 
   Position1: P -> new
   Position2: A -> testing if A is there? 
   Position3: R -> testing if R is in 3rd? 
   Position4: T -> new
   Position5: Y -> new

 But wait: we have R and A both in the word? And we are testing R at 3rd and A at 2nd? Which are both allowed? 

 Alternatively, what about ""RABBI""? -> but that has repeated letters? And we don't know if repeated letters are in the word? Also, we should avoid repeats? Not necessary, but might be inefficient? But let's choose words with unique letters? 

 Also, ""RABBI"" is not common? and has B and I? But also allows A in 2nd? 

 Actually, we want to use distinct letters? Because if there are repeated letters we might get less information? 

 So let's aim for distinct letters.

 Therefore, ""RADIO"" and ""PARTY"" and ""RASPY"" are candidates? 

 But note: in the secret word, we don't know if there are repeated letters? So we could avoid repeating? And since the feedback doesn't indicate repetition? So we can assume distinct? 

 Now, to decide: we want to cover more common vowels and consonants? 

 Common vowels: A, O, I? We already have O and I in ""RADIO""? 

 Common consonants: S, T, R? We have R and T and S? 

 How about ""RAINS""? -> but N was disallowed? Because in first guess N was marked x? So not in word? So ""RAINS"" invalid? 

 Similarly, ""CARES"" -> C is disallowed? 

 So best candidate: ""RADIO"" vs ""PARTY"" vs ""RASPY""

 Let me pick ""PARTY"" because it has R and A in two new positions? And also introduces P, T, Y? 

 Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" is invalid because if we put R in 2nd -> which we know is wrong? 

 How about ""ROAST""? 
   We decided against because A is in 3rd? We know A is not in 3rd? So why repeat? 

 Therefore, I think ""PARTY"" is a good choice.

 But what about the word ""PARKS""? 
   P, A, R, K, S -> A in 2nd? R in 3rd? Both allowed? And K and S are new? 

 Also good? 

 Maybe I'll choose a word that doesn't have R and A adjacent? 

 Another candidate: ""FLAIR""? 
   F, L, A, I, R -> 
   A in position 3? But wait, we know A is not in position 3? So we cannot put A in 3rd? 

 Therefore, ""FLAIR"" is invalid? 

 How about ""STAIR""? 
   S, T, A, I, R -> 
   A in position 3 -> forbidden? So invalid.

 Alternative: ""ARTIS""? Wait, ARTIS is not a word? 

 Let me pick a word: ""GRAPY""? Not a word.

 How about ""BRAVE""? 
   But B, R, A, V, E -> E is disallowed? 

 ""FRAME"": has E? 

 ""GLARE"": has E? 

 ""SHARP"": 
   S, H, A, R, P -> 
   Position1: S
   Position2: H
   Position3: A -> but we cannot put A in 3rd? So invalid.

 ""HORDE"": has E? 

 ""AMBER"": has E? 

 ""PLAIN"": has N? disallowed.

 So back to: ""RASPY"", ""RADIO"", ""PARTY"", ""PARKS"".

 I think ""RADIO"" and ""PARTY"" are both good? 
  ""RADIO"": A in 2nd and R in 1st? 
  ""PARTY"": A in 2nd and R in 3rd? 

 Which one? 
  For ""RADIO"": 
    If the word has R in 1st, we get a ✓ for R? 
    And A in 2nd, could it be? 

  For ""PARTY"": 
    A in 2nd and R in 3rd? 

 Actually, we don't know? 

 Another factor: We want to include common letters that we haven't tried? 
  First guess ""CRANE"" tested: C, R, A, N, E -> we know about R and A.

  Therefore, we should introduce letters that aren't excluded: so letters like S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

  In ""RADIO"": D and I and O? 
  In ""PARTY"": P, T, Y? 

 Common letters: T appears in a lot of words? So maybe including T is better? 

 Also, note: we know the word doesn't have C, N, E? So we can use T? 

 I think ""PARTY"" is a good choice? 

 Alternatively, ""RUSTY"": 
   R, U, S, T, Y -> 
   R in 1st? 
   But A? We must include A? No, we don't have A? We know A is in the word, so if we don't include A, we won't get information about A's position? Then we'll have to guess it later? However, by including we can get feedback on A? 

 But note: we already know A is in the word? Yes, so if we don't include it, then the feedback won't tell us anything about its position? So we might have to try again later? It's better to use it? 

 Therefore, we must include A? Actually, no, we are not forced? But it's recommended? 

 We have 6 guesses? And we might get information? So let's include both R and A? 

 Therefore, I'll go with ""PARTY"".

 Guess: ""party""After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)), we know:
- R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- C, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- We need a new guess that includes R and A in positions other than 2 (for R) and 3 (for A), while avoiding C, N, E.

For an optimal second guess:
- Include R and A in untried positions to locate them (e.g., try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5, and A in 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Introduce new common letters like T, P, and Y to gather more information.
- Avoid repeating the ineffective positions from the first guess.

""party"" fits perfectly:
- P, T, Y are new untested letters.
- A is placed in position 2 (untried, since only position 3 was ruled out).
- R is placed in position 3 (untried, since only position 2 was ruled out).
- Uses distinct letters and excludes known absent letters (C, N, E).

This guess maximizes letter coverage and position testing for R and A.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(-) T(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>
### Previous Feedback Analysis:
- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively.  
  - C, N, E are absent.  
- **Guess 2: party** → P(x), A(✓), R(-), T(x), Y(x)  
  - A is correct and fixed at position 2.  
  - R is present but not at position 3 (since marked ""-"").  
  - P, T, Y are absent.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `_ A _ _ _` (second letter is A).  
2. **R's position**: Must be at position 1, 4, or 5 (excludes position 2 from Guess 1 and position 3 from Guess 2).  
3. **Absent letters**: C, E, N, P, T, Y (avoid these).  
4. **Valid letters to test**: Focus on untested common letters (e.g., S, L, I, D, G, H, M, O, U) and include R in an untested position.  

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- Test R at **position 1** (since positions 4/5 aren't tested yet, but position 1 is high-priority as a starting letter).  
- Include new common letters (I, L, S) to maximize information.  
- Avoid all absent letters and maintain valid English words.  
- Choose **""rails""**:  
  - R at position 1 (tests R in a new position).  
  - A at position 2 (confirms fixed ✓).  
  - New letters: I, L, S (high-frequency consonants/vowels).  
  - Shape: `R A I L S`, avoiding all known absent letters.

And also use R and A.\n\n However, in ""PARTY"": \n   Position1: P -> new\n   Position2: A -> testing if A is there? \n   Position3: R -> testing if R is in 3rd? \n   Position4: T -> new\n   Position5: Y -> new\n\n But wait: we have R and A both in the word? And we are testing R at 3rd and A at 2nd? Which are both allowed? \n\n Alternatively, what about ""RABBI""? -> but that has repeated letters? And we don\'t know if repeated letters are in the word? Also, we should avoid repeats? Not necessary, but might be inefficient? But let\'s choose words with unique letters? \n\n Also, ""RABBI"" is not common? and has B and I? But also allows A in 2nd? \n\n Actually, we want to use distinct letters? Because if there are repeated letters we might get less information? \n\n So let\'s aim for distinct letters.\n\n Therefore, ""RADIO"" and ""PARTY"" and ""RASPY"" are candidates? \n\n But note: in the secret word, we don\'t know if there are repeated letters? So we could avoid repeating? And since the feedback doesn\'t indicate repetition? So we can assume distinct? \n\n Now, to decide: we want to cover more common vowels and consonants? \n\n Common vowels: A, O, I? We already have O and I in ""RADIO""? \n\n Common consonants: S, T, R? We have R and T and S? \n\n How about ""RAINS""? -> but N was disallowed? Because in first guess N was marked x? So not in word? So ""RAINS"" invalid? \n\n Similarly, ""CARES"" -> C is disallowed? \n\n So best candidate: ""RADIO"" vs ""PARTY"" vs ""RASPY""\n\n Let me pick ""PARTY"" because it has R and A in two new positions? And also introduces P, T, Y? \n\n Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" is invalid because if we put R in 2nd -> which we know is wrong? \n\n How about ""ROAST""? \n   We decided against because A is in 3rd? We know A is not in 3rd? So why repeat? \n\n Therefore, I think ""PARTY"" is a good choice.\n\n But what about the word ""PARKS""? \n   P, A, R, K, S -> A in 2nd? R in 3rd? Both allowed? And K and S are new? \n\n Also good? \n\n Maybe I\'ll choose a word that doesn\'t have R and A adjacent? \n\n Another candidate: ""FLAIR""? \n   F, L, A, I, R -> \n   A in position 3? But wait, we know A is not in position 3? So we cannot put A in 3rd? \n\n Therefore, ""FLAIR"" is invalid? \n\n How about ""STAIR""? \n   S, T, A, I, R -> \n   A in position 3 -> forbidden? So invalid.\n\n Alternative: ""ARTIS""? Wait, ARTIS is not a word? \n\n Let me pick a word: ""GRAPY""? Not a word.\n\n How about ""BRAVE""? \n   But B, R, A, V, E -> E is disallowed? \n\n ""FRAME"": has E? \n\n ""GLARE"": has E? \n\n ""SHARP"": \n   S, H, A, R, P -> \n   Position1: S\n   Position2: H\n   Position3: A -> but we cannot put A in 3rd? So invalid.\n\n ""HORDE"": has E? \n\n ""AMBER"": has E? \n\n ""PLAIN"": has N? disallowed.\n\n So back to: ""RASPY"", ""RADIO"", ""PARTY"", ""PARKS"".\n\n I think ""RADIO"" and ""PARTY"" are both good? \n  ""RADIO"": A in 2nd and R in 1st? \n  ""PARTY"": A in 2nd and R in 3rd? \n\n Which one? \n  For ""RADIO"": \n    If the word has R in 1st, we get a ✓ for R? \n    And A in 2nd, could it be? \n\n  For ""PARTY"": \n    A in 2nd and R in 3rd? \n\n Actually, we don\'t know? \n\n Another factor: We want to include common letters that we haven\'t tried? \n  First guess ""CRANE"" tested: C, R, A, N, E -> we know about R and A.\n\n  Therefore, we should introduce letters that aren\'t excluded: so letters like S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.\n\n  In ""RADIO"": D and I and O? \n  In ""PARTY"": P, T, Y? \n\n Common letters: T appears in a lot of words? So maybe including T is better? \n\n Also, note: we know the word doesn\'t have C, N, E? So we can use T? \n\n I think ""PARTY"" is a good choice? \n\n Alternatively, ""RUSTY"": \n   R, U, S, T, Y -> \n   R in 1st? \n   But A? We must include A? No, we don\'t have A? We know A is in the word, so if we don\'t include A, we won\'t get information about A\'s position? Then we\'ll have to guess it later? However, by including we can get feedback on A? \n\n But note: we already know A is in the word? Yes, so if we don\'t include it, then the feedback won\'t tell us anything about its position? So we might have to try again later? It\'s better to use it? \n\n Therefore, we must include A? Actually, no, we are not forced? But it\'s recommended? \n\n We have 6 guesses? And we might get information? So let\'s include both R and A? \n\n Therefore, I\'ll go with ""PARTY"".\n\n Guess: ""party""After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)), we know:\n- R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.\n- C, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.\n- We need a new guess that includes R and A in positions other than 2 (for R) and 3 (for A), while avoiding C, N, E.\n\nFor an optimal second guess:\n- Include R and A in untried positions to locate them (e.g., try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5, and A in 1, 2, 4, or 5).\n- Introduce new common letters like T, P, and Y to gather more information.\n- Avoid repeating the ineffective positions from the first guess.\n\n""party"" fits perfectly:\n- P, T, Y are new untested letters.\n- A is placed in position 2 (untried, since only position 3 was ruled out).\n- R is placed in position 3 (untried, since only position 2 was ruled out).\n- Uses distinct letters and excludes known absent letters (C, N, E).\n\nThis guess maximizes letter coverage and position testing for R and A.\n\n<guess>party</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(-) T(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> P(x), A(✓), R(-), T(x), Y(x)\n\nInterpretation:\n\nFrom Guess 1:\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was marked \'-\' meaning wrong position).\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked \'-\' meaning wrong position).\n- C, N, E are not in the word.\n\nFrom Guess 2:\n- A is correct in position 2 (marked \'✓\'). So the second letter of the secret word is A.\n- R is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and marked \'-\' wrong position).\n- P, T, Y are not in the word.\n\nAdditionally, from Guess 1, we know R is in the word but not in position 2. Now from Guess 2, R is also not in position 3. So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nAlso, note that the secret word has the second letter as A.\n\nKnown absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, Y.\n\nKnown present letters: R (position unknown, but not 2 or 3), and A (fixed at position 2).\n\nSo the secret word pattern is: _ A _ _ _\n\nWe know R must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5? Actually: \n- If R were in position 1, we did not test position 1? In Guess 1, we had R at position 2? So we haven\'t tested position 1? \nBut in Guess 2, we didn\'t have any letter at position 1? We had P at 1? That was absent? \n\nWe need to find a word that:\n- Has the second letter \'A\'.\n- Includes R (since R is present) in either position 1, 4, or 5? Note: we cannot put R in 2nd because it\'s A? And we cannot put R in 3rd? Because in Guess 2 we tried and it was wrong? So 1,4,5 are open? \n- Also, avoid the absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, Y.\n\nNow, we need more letters? So we should choose a word that has R in position 1, 4 or 5? And introduce new letters? \n\nWe also should avoid placing R in positions that we know are wrong? Which we have? \n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested position 1 at all? We put C in Guess 1? But C was absent? So position 1 is unknown? Similarly, positions 4 and 5: we tried N then Y? Both absent? \n\nSo for our third guess, we can try R in any of positions 1, 4, or 5? But we need to cover more letters? \n\nLet me think: since A is fixed at position 2, the word must be: ? A ? ? ?\n\nWe know R must be at 1, 4, or 5? \n\nAnd we avoid: C, E, N, P, T, Y? \n\nWhat are available letters? \nWe haven\'t tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z? \n\nCommon ones: B, D, I, S, O? \n\nWe need a word that has the pattern ?A???, and includes R? And avoids the banned letters? \n\nAlso, note: we don\'t know if there are any repeated letters? But let\'s assume we avoid? \n\nNow, if we put R at position 1: then the word becomes R A ? ? ? \nThen we have to fill the last three? \n\nPossible words: ""RABID"", but B? but D? \nBut ""RABID"": R, A, B, I, D -> letters? \nAlso, ""RABID"" has B, I, D? \n\nBut note: in the positions? \nPosition 3: B? We don\'t know?\nPosition 4: I?\nPosition 5: D?\n\nAlso, let me check if that avoids banned letters? C,E,N,P,T,Y? Yes? \n\nBut is it valid? \n\nAlternatively: ""RADIO""? But O? But note: we have position 4: I? And position 5: O? \nBut we haven\'t tried these letters? \n\nBut wait, in the first guess, we had A and R? But we already know A? So we can try? \n\nBut note: in Guess 2, we got A in the correct position? So now let me think of words? \n\nBut what if R is in position 1? \n\nAnother option: ""RAGAS""? but repeated A? And invalid? \n\nHow about ""RAVES""? But E? E is disallowed? \n\n""RAINS""? But N? disallowed.\n\nAnother idea: ""RALES""? but has E? disallowed.\n\n""SALAD""? but S? but S hasn\'t been tried? But also, we have A at position 2? So the word must be ?A???. \nIf we put R at position 1: then words beginning with RA? \n\nBut also: we could put R at position 4? That is, ? A ? R ? \nOr position 5? ? A ? ? R? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nSo we need to test? \n\nHow about we try R in position 1? Since it hasn\'t been tested? \n\nBut also: we can choose a word that has R at 1, and includes other new letters? \n\nBut note: if R is in position 1, then in Guess1 we had R in 2nd? And we got R present? So why wasn\'t R marked as present due to position 1? Because in Guess1 there was no R at position 1? So it might be? \n\nAlternatively, if R is at position 4? Then in Guess1? We had R in position 2? Which doesn\'t conflict? \n\nSimilarly, position 5? \n\nBut since we are going to test? \n\nBut we can also choose a word that tests multiple possibilities? \n\nHowever, with the constraint that A is fixed? \n\nCommon words that fit: \n- ""RABID"": R at 1, A at 2? \n  Then unknown B, I, D? \n\nBut not very common? \n\nHow about ""RADII""? repeated I? and not common? \n\n""RASPS""? But P and S? P? but we know P is absent? P is banned? \n\nFrom Guess 2, P is absent? So we cannot use P? \n\nSimilarly, we cannot use T? \n\nSo letters banned: C,E,N,P,T,Y? \n\nTherefore, ""RABID"" is acceptable? \n\nBut perhaps we can try a more common word? \n\nHow about ""RAILS""? \n   R, A, I, L, S?\n   But position 1: R, position 2: A, position 3: I, position 4: L, position 5: S? \n   But we haven\'t tried I,L,S? \n   And avoid C,E,N,P,T,Y? Yes? \n\nBut ""RAILS"" is a word? \n\nAlso, we could test R at 1? \n\nSimilarly, we can test R at 4? Or 5? \n\nBut I think testing R at 1? Since we might get full word? \n\nAlso, having S and L might be helpful? \n\nBut note: if we put R in position 1, and the secret word has R at 1? Then we get ✓ for R? \n\nOtherwise, if R is not at 1, then we might get R marked as \'-\' if it is at 4 or 5? \n\nSo it helps pin down R\'s position? \n\nTherefore, I think ""RAILS"" is a good candidate? \n\nBut wait? Another possibility: ""BAKER""? But E? not allowed? \n\nOr ""DANCE""? N? not allowed? \n\nSo let me go with ""RAILS"".\n\nBut what if R is not at 1? Then we will get R marked as absent? But no? Because R is definitely in the word? So if we put R at 1? Then:\n- If R is at 1: then ✓\n- If R is not at 1? But since we have it? Then R should be marked as \'-\' meaning it\'s present but in wrong position? \n\nBecause R is present? So we cannot get R marked as \'x\'? Because we know R is present? So if we put R at 1? And R is actually at 4? Then we will get R marked as \'-\' meaning present but wrong position? \n\nAnd similarly? \n\nSo in any case, we get information about R\'s position? \n\nTherefore, ""RAILS"" is a valid guess: \n  Positions: \n    1: R? \n    2: A? Correct? \n    3: I? \n    4: L? \n    5: S? \n\nBut wait? position 2: A is fixed? So A will be correct? \n\nAnd we haven\'t tested I, L, S? \n\nAlternatively, if we think R might be at 4? Then we can try a word with R at 4? And another common letter? \n\nFor example: ""DAILY""? \n  D, A, I, L, Y? \n  But Y is disallowed? From Guess2? \n\nBecause Y in Guess2 was absent? So we cannot use Y? \n\nAnother one: ""MAILS""? \n  M, A, I, L, S? \n  Then we don\'t use R? But we must use R? Because we haven\'t tested R in positions 4 or 5? \n\nWe know R is present? So we should include it? So we must include R? \n\nTherefore, we need to use R in the guess? \n\nBut if we put R at 4? Then word: ? A ? R ? \n\nFor instance: ""SAVOR""? \n  But V and O? \n  But also S? \n  But avoid banned? \n\nBut we cannot test without R? \n\nSo to test R at 4? We try: ""BARREL""? not 5? \n\nWords: ""HAREM""? But E? disallowed? \n\n""CAROM""? C? disallowed? \n\n""ARMOR""? R repeated? \n\n""FARMS""? \n  F, A, R, M, S? \n  Then: position1: F? \n  position2: A? \n  position3: R? But wait? We know R is not in position 3? Because Guess2 had R at 3 and got \'-\', meaning R is not at 3? \n\nSo how can we put R at 3? We cannot? \n\nSo for position4: R? \nThen the word: ? A ? R ? \n\nNeed a letter at position1, position3, position5? \n\nFor example: ""HAIRY""? But Y? disallowed? \n\n""GAUDY""? G,A,U,D,Y? Y disallowed? \n\n""BASIC""? C disallowed? \n\n""VALID""? V,A,L,I,D? \nBut no R? \n\nSo difficult? \n\nBut we know R must be included? \n\nTherefore, we can try R at position1? Or position4? Or position5? \n\nHow about R at position4? Then: \n  Words: ...R \n  Positions: \n    1: some letter? \n    2: A? \n    3: some letter? \n    4: R? \n    5: some letter? \n\nExample: ""OARED""? has E? \n\n""FARES""? has E? \n\n""DARES""? has E? \n\n""LARKS""? \n  L, A, R, K, S? \n  Position1: L? \n  Position2: A? \n  Position3: R? But wait, position3? We know R cannot be in position3? Because Guess2 had R at 3 and it was marked as \'-\' meaning R is not at 3? \n\nIn ""LARKS"": R is at position3? Which we know is impossible? \n\nSo we cannot put R at position3? \n\nTherefore, any word that has R at position3? Would be inefficient? \n\nSimilarly, word with R at position4? Then how? \n\nFor ""FARMS"" from above? \n  F at 1, A at 2, R at 3? Oh, I see, I put R at 3 in ""FARMS""? That is invalid? We must avoid R at position3? \n\nTherefore, for position4? We need a word that has R at 4? \nExample: ""CHAIR""? But C? \n\n""PAIRS""? but P? banned? \n\n""HAIRS""? \n  H, A, I, R, S? \n  Then: \n    1: H? \n    2: A? \n    3: I? \n    4: R? \n    5: S? \n\nThis avoids C,E,N,P,T,Y? \n\nBut does ""HAIRS"" have R at 4? Yes? \n\nSimilarly, ""FRAUD""? \n  F,R,A,U,D -> R at 1? \n\nBut if we choose ""HAIRS"", then R is at position4? \n\nSimilarly, position5: R? Then word: ? A ? ? R? \nExample: ""KOALA""? not? \n\n""SONAR""? \n  S, O, N, A, R -> but N banned? \n\n""SUGAR""? \n  S, U, G, A, R -> \n  1: S? \n  2: U? but why? Position2 must be A? So we need A at 2? \n\nPattern: second letter must be A? \n\nSo for position5: R? ? A ? ? R? \n\nWord: ? A ? ? R? \n\nFor example: ""GLAMR""? not word? \n\n""FLAIR""? \n   F, L, A, I, R -> \n  1:F, 2:L? But 2 must be A? So not? \n\n""CHAOR""? not? \n\nSo it\'s hard? \n\nTherefore, easier to try R at position1? \n\nThus, I\'ll go with ""RAILS"". \n\nBut let\'s confirm: \n  ""RAILS"": \n    R, A, I, L, S? \n    Positions: \n        1: R -> new? \n        2: A -> we know ✓? \n        3: I -> new? \n        4: L -> new? \n        5: S -> new? \n\nAnd it avoids banned letters? \n\nYes? \n\nAnd if the secret word was ""RAILS""? We win? \n\nIf not, we get information about R? And I, L, S? \n\nAlternative: ""RABID"", but similar? \n\nBut ""RAILS"" seems common? \n\nOkay? \n\nBut note: we have already used 2 guesses? Now third? \n\nSo guess: ""rails"" or ""RAILS""? \n\nBut let me note: in Guess2, A was fixed? So this word has A at 2? So that will be guaranteed ✓? \n\nSo we only test R at 1 and the other letters? \n\nSo I think it\'s good? \n\nTherefore, I choose ""rails"".\n\nNote: we must use uppercase? But in the response we can use uppercase? \n\nIn the feedback examples? They used uppercase? \n\nBut in the guess output? We use lowercase? \n\nOr consistent? \n\nBut I think the application expects in the <guess> tag? \n\nSo I\'ll use lowercase? \n\nBut for clarity? \n\nActually, the first time I guessed ""crane"" and ""party"" in lowercase? \n\nSo I\'ll use ""rails"".\n\nBut let me confirm: is ""rails"" a valid word?

- Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _ (second letter is A).
- R must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (since it's not in 2 or 3).
- The word cannot contain: C, E, N, P, T, Y.

For the next guess:
- We need to test R in a new position (position 1, 4, or 5). Let's test R at position 1 since it's a common starting position.
- The word must include R and avoid the absent letters.
- We should introduce new common letters to gather more information. Good candidates are S, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, M.
- A possible guess is ""rails"": 
  - Position 1: R (testing R at a new position)
  - Position 2: A (fixed, so ✓)
  - Positions 3,4,5: I, L, S (new letters without conflicting with absent ones)
- This tests R at 1 and introduces three new letters (I,L,S).

So, we guess ""rails"".

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for our first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C and N and E are not in the word at all.
 - R is in the word but not in the position we guessed (which was the 2nd position).
 - A is in the word but not in the position we guessed (which was the 3rd position).

 So the secret word contains R and A, but not C, N, E.

 Also, since R and A are present, but not in the positions we guessed, we know:
 - R cannot be in the 2nd position (but must be in some other position: 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th).
 - A cannot be in the 3rd position (but must be in some other position: 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th).

 Additionally, the secret word does not contain: C, N, E.

 For our next guess, we should:
 1. Make sure to include R and A (since we know they are in the word).
 2. Avoid using any of the letters that are not present: C, N, E.
 3. We can use other letters that are common to get more information.

 Let's think of words that contain R and A, but not C, N, E.

 Also, note that the word must be 5 letters.

 We must avoid placing R and A in the positions that are already known to be wrong for them?
 Actually, for R: we guessed it in position 2 and it was wrong, but we don't know where it belongs. Similarly for A.

 However, we should try a word where R and A are in different positions than before.

 Common positions to try:
 Since R was excluded from position 2, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, A should not be in position 3, so we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We don't know the positions, so we can experiment.

 Also, we should introduce new letters to get more information.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

 We want to cover multiple common letters.

 Let's brainstorm words that include R and A, and three new letters, excluding C, N, E.

 Possible words: 
 - ""RATIO"": has R, A, T, I, O -> good letters? But note: R is in position 1 (different from before) and A in 2 (which was not the 3rd, so allowed). However, we don't know if A can be in 2nd? Feedback didn't say anything about A in 2nd? Yes, we can try.

 But note: We must avoid placing R in the 2nd? Actually we guessed R in 2nd and it was wrong, but that doesn't mean we cannot put R in 2nd in a future guess? Wait, no: because the feedback said that R is in the word but not in the 2nd position. So we must avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we are allowed to guess R in position 2 again? But we know it's wrong, so it would be inefficient.

 For our next guess, we should not put R in the 2nd position because we know it doesn't belong there. Similarly, A should not be put in the 3rd.

 So for ""RATIO"":
  position1: R -> might be correct? possible.
  position2: A -> not forbidden for A? Only forbidden was position 3 for A? So yes, we can try A in 2.

 But the secret word might have R in a different position? We know R is not in 2nd, but we don't know about A: it might be in 2nd? We need to check.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"": but note that we must avoid E and N and C? 
  ""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T -> avoids C, N, E. 
  R in 1st, which is allowed (since we only know 2nd is bad for R). 
  A in 3rd? Wait, our feedback said A is not in the 3rd? So we cannot put A in 3rd? Because we already know that A is present but not in 3rd. So if we guess ""ROAST"", we would put A in 3rd again? That would be inefficient because we know it should be elsewhere.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the 3rd position for this new guess.

 Let me think of words that have A and R, and don't have C, N, E, and avoid placing A at position 3 and R at position 2.

 Also, we haven't tried S, T, O, etc.

 How about ""STAMP""? 
  - S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but wait, we must avoid A at position 3? So we cannot use A in position 3. 
  So ""STAMP"" is invalid for our guess because it puts A at 3rd which we know is wrong.

 What about ""PARTS""?
  P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, T at 4, S at 5.
  - A is in 2nd: that's okay (since we don't know anything about position 2 for A? Only that 3rd is wrong). 
  - R is in 3rd: that's okay? Because we only know R was wrong in 2nd? So R in 3rd is a new position? Yes.

 Let me check: 
  Position for R: not in 2nd -> so we can put R in 1,3,4,5.
  Position for A: not in 3rd -> so we can put A in 1,2,4,5.

 So ""PARTS"": 
  A is in position 2: allowed.
  R is in position 3: allowed.

 And it avoids C, N, E.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TRAIL"": 
   T, R, A, I, L 
   R in position 2 -> but wait, we know R is not in position 2? So that would be inefficient. Therefore, avoid placing R in position 2.

 Therefore, words that have R in 2nd should be avoided? Yes.

 Other ideas: ""RAPID"", ""BARES"" (but B is new?), ""RASPY"", ""GRAPE"" (but E is disallowed? because we know E is not in the word? Yes, E is disallowed).

 So ""GRAPE"" is invalid because of E.

 How about ""DRAWL""? 
   D, R, A, W, L -> avoids C,N,E? 
   R is in 2nd -> avoid? Because we know R is not in 2nd? So don't use that.

 Alternatively, ""ARGUE""? 
   A, R, G, U, E -> but E is disallowed? Yes, we cannot use E.

 Another word: ""ORBIT""? 
   O, R, B, I, T -> but doesn't include A? We must include A because we know it's in the word? No, we have to include both R and A? We don't have to, but including them might help? Actually, we know both R and A are present. If we don't include them, we might get feedback that doesn't tell us about their positions? So we should try to include known letters to pin down their positions.

 Therefore, I think we should include both R and A.

 Let me prioritize including R and A in new positions.

 Possibilities:
  R in position 1: words like R__?__ 
      R A ? ? ? : but also avoid position 3 for A? So A must be in 4th or 5th? Or position 2? 
      Example: ""RADIO""? -> R, A, D, I, O -> but A in position 2? That's okay? And avoid C,N,E? 
          Also, we don't have any restrictions for the other letters? 
      So ""RADIO"": 
        - R at 1: allowed 
        - A at 2: allowed? We don't know? Only 3rd is forbidden? So 2nd is open.
        - D, I, O are new.

  Alternatively, ""RASPY"": 
      R, A, S, P, Y 
      R at 1, A at 2 -> avoids C,N,E? 
      But same position for A? Well, position 2 is allowed? But what about R? Position 1 is allowed? 

  However, we also need to consider that we don't know if A can be at position 2? So we try?

 But note: the feedback only said A is not in the 3rd. It might very well be in the 2nd? So we can try.

 But also, we know R cannot be in the 2nd? And we are putting R in 1st? That's a new position? Good.

 However, let's check for other common words: ""PARTY"" -> P, A, R, T, Y -> 
   Positions: 
     A at 2nd -> allowed
     R at 3rd -> allowed (because only 2nd is bad so far)
   But R at 3rd? We don't know? So that could be? 

 Compare: we have two known letters R and A, and we want to test them in positions we haven't tried? 
  For R, we only tried position 2? So now we can try position 1,3,4, or 5? 
  Similarly for A: we only tried position 3? So we can try 1,2,4,5.

 We also want to maximize new letter information.

 Perhaps ""PARTY"" is a good candidate? 
   Letters: P, A, R, T, Y -> all new? 

 But note: in ""crane"", we didn't have P, T, Y? So that would introduce three new letters? And also use R and A.

 However, in ""PARTY"": 
   Position1: P -> new
   Position2: A -> testing if A is there? 
   Position3: R -> testing if R is in 3rd? 
   Position4: T -> new
   Position5: Y -> new

 But wait: we have R and A both in the word? And we are testing R at 3rd and A at 2nd? Which are both allowed? 

 Alternatively, what about ""RABBI""? -> but that has repeated letters? And we don't know if repeated letters are in the word? Also, we should avoid repeats? Not necessary, but might be inefficient? But let's choose words with unique letters? 

 Also, ""RABBI"" is not common? and has B and I? But also allows A in 2nd? 

 Actually, we want to use distinct letters? Because if there are repeated letters we might get less information? 

 So let's aim for distinct letters.

 Therefore, ""RADIO"" and ""PARTY"" and ""RASPY"" are candidates? 

 But note: in the secret word, we don't know if there are repeated letters? So we could avoid repeating? And since the feedback doesn't indicate repetition? So we can assume distinct? 

 Now, to decide: we want to cover more common vowels and consonants? 

 Common vowels: A, O, I? We already have O and I in ""RADIO""? 

 Common consonants: S, T, R? We have R and T and S? 

 How about ""RAINS""? -> but N was disallowed? Because in first guess N was marked x? So not in word? So ""RAINS"" invalid? 

 Similarly, ""CARES"" -> C is disallowed? 

 So best candidate: ""RADIO"" vs ""PARTY"" vs ""RASPY""

 Let me pick ""PARTY"" because it has R and A in two new positions? And also introduces P, T, Y? 

 Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" is invalid because if we put R in 2nd -> which we know is wrong? 

 How about ""ROAST""? 
   We decided against because A is in 3rd? We know A is not in 3rd? So why repeat? 

 Therefore, I think ""PARTY"" is a good choice.

 But what about the word ""PARKS""? 
   P, A, R, K, S -> A in 2nd? R in 3rd? Both allowed? And K and S are new? 

 Also good? 

 Maybe I'll choose a word that doesn't have R and A adjacent? 

 Another candidate: ""FLAIR""? 
   F, L, A, I, R -> 
   A in position 3? But wait, we know A is not in position 3? So we cannot put A in 3rd? 

 Therefore, ""FLAIR"" is invalid? 

 How about ""STAIR""? 
   S, T, A, I, R -> 
   A in position 3 -> forbidden? So invalid.

 Alternative: ""ARTIS""? Wait, ARTIS is not a word? 

 Let me pick a word: ""GRAPY""? Not a word.

 How about ""BRAVE""? 
   But B, R, A, V, E -> E is disallowed? 

 ""FRAME"": has E? 

 ""GLARE"": has E? 

 ""SHARP"": 
   S, H, A, R, P -> 
   Position1: S
   Position2: H
   Position3: A -> but we cannot put A in 3rd? So invalid.

 ""HORDE"": has E? 

 ""AMBER"": has E? 

 ""PLAIN"": has N? disallowed.

 So back to: ""RASPY"", ""RADIO"", ""PARTY"", ""PARKS"".

 I think ""RADIO"" and ""PARTY"" are both good? 
  ""RADIO"": A in 2nd and R in 1st? 
  ""PARTY"": A in 2nd and R in 3rd? 

 Which one? 
  For ""RADIO"": 
    If the word has R in 1st, we get a ✓ for R? 
    And A in 2nd, could it be? 

  For ""PARTY"": 
    A in 2nd and R in 3rd? 

 Actually, we don't know? 

 Another factor: We want to include common letters that we haven't tried? 
  First guess ""CRANE"" tested: C, R, A, N, E -> we know about R and A.

  Therefore, we should introduce letters that aren't excluded: so letters like S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

  In ""RADIO"": D and I and O? 
  In ""PARTY"": P, T, Y? 

 Common letters: T appears in a lot of words? So maybe including T is better? 

 Also, note: we know the word doesn't have C, N, E? So we can use T? 

 I think ""PARTY"" is a good choice? 

 Alternatively, ""RUSTY"": 
   R, U, S, T, Y -> 
   R in 1st? 
   But A? We must include A? No, we don't have A? We know A is in the word, so if we don't include A, we won't get information about A's position? Then we'll have to guess it later? However, by including we can get feedback on A? 

 But note: we already know A is in the word? Yes, so if we don't include it, then the feedback won't tell us anything about its position? So we might have to try again later? It's better to use it? 

 Therefore, we must include A? Actually, no, we are not forced? But it's recommended? 

 We have 6 guesses? And we might get information? So let's include both R and A? 

 Therefore, I'll go with ""PARTY"".

 Guess: ""party""After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)), we know:
- R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- C, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- We need a new guess that includes R and A in positions other than 2 (for R) and 3 (for A), while avoiding C, N, E.

For an optimal second guess:
- Include R and A in untried positions to locate them (e.g., try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5, and A in 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Introduce new common letters like T, P, and Y to gather more information.
- Avoid repeating the ineffective positions from the first guess.

""party"" fits perfectly:
- P, T, Y are new untested letters.
- A is placed in position 2 (untried, since only position 3 was ruled out).
- R is placed in position 3 (untried, since only position 2 was ruled out).
- Uses distinct letters and excludes known absent letters (C, N, E).

This guess maximizes letter coverage and position testing for R and A.

3. **Absent letters**: C, E, N, P, T, Y (avoid these).  
4. **Valid letters to test**: Focus on untested common letters (e.g., S, L, I, D, G, H, M, O, U) and include R in an untested position.  

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- Test R at **position 1** (since positions 4/5 aren't tested yet, but position 1 is high-priority as a starting letter).  
- Include new common letters (I, L, S) to maximize information.  
- Avoid all absent letters and maintain valid English words.  
- Choose **""rails""**:  
  - R at position 1 (tests R in a new position).  
  - A at position 2 (confirms fixed ✓).  
  - New letters: I, L, S (high-frequency consonants/vowels).

<guess>rails -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- From ""crane"": R and A are in the word, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively. C, N, E are absent.
- From ""party"": A is correct and in position 2 (so A is fixed at the second letter). R is in the word but not in position 3. P, T, Y are absent.
- Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _ (second letter is A).
- R must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (since it's not in 2 or 3).
- The word cannot contain: C, E, N, P, T, Y.

For the next guess:
- We need to test R in a new position (position 1, 4, or 5). Let's test R at position 1 since it's a common starting position.
- The word must include R and avoid the absent letters.
- We should introduce new common letters to gather more information. Good candidates are S, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, M.
- A possible guess is ""rails"": 
  - Position 1: R (testing R at a new position)
  - Position 2: A (fixed, so ✓)
  - Positions 3,4,5: I, L, S (new letters without conflicting with absent ones)
- This tests R at 1 and introduces three new letters (I,L,S).

So, we guess ""rails"".### Previous Feedback Recap:
- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - R and A must be in the word, but not in positions 2 or 3.  
  - C, N, E are **absent**.  
- **Guess 2: party** → P(x), A(✓), R(-), T(x), Y(x)  
  - **A is fixed at position 2** (✓).  
  - R is present but **not at position 3** (""-"" marking).  
  - P, T, Y are **absent**.  

### Deductions:
1. **Pattern**: `? A ? ? ?` (A locked in position 2).  
2. **R's possible positions**: **1, 4, or 5** (excludes position 2 from Guess 1 and position 3 from Guess 2).  
3. **Absent letters**: C, E, N, P, T, Y (avoid these).  
4. **Untested letters**: Focus on S, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, M, B, F, etc.  

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- **Test R at position 1** (high-priority starter position; positions 4/5 can be tested later).  
- Include **new high-frequency letters** like S, L, I for coverage.  
- Avoid all absent letters and ensure valid English word.  
- **Chosen guess: ""rails""**  
  - ✅ Tests R at position 1 (untested position).  
  - ✅ Confirms A at position 2 (fixed ✓).  
  - ✅ Introduces 3 new letters: I, L, S (maximizes information).  
  - ✅ Excludes absent letters: no C, E, N, P, T, Y.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(-) T(x) Y(x)
Guess 3: tag? 

So I'll use lowercase? 

But for clarity? 

Actually, the first time I guessed ""crane"" and ""party"" in lowercase? 

So I'll use ""rails"".

But let me confirm: is ""rails"" a valid word? Yes? Railways or similar? 

So proceed? 

If we are wrong? Then feedback will help?

### Previous Feedback Analysis:
- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively.  
  - C, N, E are absent.  
- **Guess 2: party** → P(x), A(✓), R(-), T(x), Y(x)  
  - A is correct and fixed at position 2.  
  - R is present but not at position 3 (since marked ""-"").  
  - P, T, Y are absent.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `_ A _ _ _` (second letter is A).  
2. **R's position**: Must be at position 1, 4, or 5 (excludes position 2 from Guess 1 and position 3 from Guess 2).  
3. **Absent letters**: C, E, N, P, T, Y (avoid these).  
4. **Valid letters to test**: Focus on untested common letters (e.g., S, L, I, D, G, H, M, O, U) and include R in an untested position.  

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- Test R at **position 1** (since positions 4/5 aren't tested yet, but position 1 is high-priority as a starting letter).  
- Include new common letters (I, L, S) to maximize information.  
- Avoid all absent letters and maintain valid English words.  
- Choose **""rails""**:  
  - R at position 1 (tests R in a new position).  
  - A at position 2 (confirms fixed ✓).  
  - New letters: I, L, S (high-frequency consonants/vowels).  
  - Shape: `R A I L S`, avoiding all known absent letters.

Make sure to include R and A (since we know they are in the word).\n 2. Avoid using any of the letters that are not present: C, N, E.\n 3. We can use other letters that are common to get more information.\n\n Let\'s think of words that contain R and A, but not C, N, E.\n\n Also, note that the word must be 5 letters.\n\n We must avoid placing R and A in the positions that are already known to be wrong for them?\n Actually, for R: we guessed it in position 2 and it was wrong, but we don\'t know where it belongs. Similarly for A.\n\n However, we should try a word where R and A are in different positions than before.\n\n Common positions to try:\n Since R was excluded from position 2, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n Similarly, A should not be in position 3, so we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n We don\'t know the positions, so we can experiment.\n\n Also, we should introduce new letters to get more information.\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.\n\n We want to cover multiple common letters.\n\n Let\'s brainstorm words that include R and A, and three new letters, excluding C, N, E.\n\n Possible words: \n - ""RATIO"": has R, A, T, I, O -> good letters? But note: R is in position 1 (different from before) and A in 2 (which was not the 3rd, so allowed). However, we don\'t know if A can be in 2nd? Feedback didn\'t say anything about A in 2nd? Yes, we can try.\n\n But note: We must avoid placing R in the 2nd? Actually we guessed R in 2nd and it was wrong, but that doesn\'t mean we cannot put R in 2nd in a future guess? Wait, no: because the feedback said that R is in the word but not in the 2nd position. So we must avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we are allowed to guess R in position 2 again? But we know it\'s wrong, so it would be inefficient.\n\n For our next guess, we should not put R in the 2nd position because we know it doesn\'t belong there. Similarly, A should not be put in the 3rd.\n\n So for ""RATIO"":\n  position1: R -> might be correct? possible.\n  position2: A -> not forbidden for A? Only forbidden was position 3 for A? So yes, we can try A in 2.\n\n But the secret word might have R in a different position? We know R is not in 2nd, but we don\'t know about A: it might be in 2nd? We need to check.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"": but note that we must avoid E and N and C? \n  ""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T -> avoids C, N, E. \n  R in 1st, which is allowed (since we only know 2nd is bad for R). \n  A in 3rd? Wait, our feedback said A is not in the 3rd? So we cannot put A in 3rd? Because we already know that A is present but not in 3rd. So if we guess ""ROAST"", we would put A in 3rd again? That would be inefficient because we know it should be elsewhere.\n\n Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the 3rd position for this new guess.\n\n Let me think of words that have A and R, and don\'t have C, N, E, and avoid placing A at position 3 and R at position 2.\n\n Also, we haven\'t tried S, T, O, etc.\n\n How about ""STAMP""? \n  - S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but wait, we must avoid A at position 3? So we cannot use A in position 3. \n  So ""STAMP"" is invalid for our guess because it puts A at 3rd which we know is wrong.\n\n What about ""PARTS""?\n  P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, T at 4, S at 5.\n  - A is in 2nd: that\'s okay (since we don\'t know anything about position 2 for A? Only that 3rd is wrong). \n  - R is in 3rd: that\'s okay? Because we only know R was wrong in 2nd? So R in 3rd is a new position? Yes.\n\n Let me check: \n  Position for R: not in 2nd -> so we can put R in 1,3,4,5.\n  Position for A: not in 3rd -> so we can put A in 1,2,4,5.\n\n So ""PARTS"": \n  A is in position 2: allowed.\n  R is in position 3: allowed.\n\n And it avoids C, N, E.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""TRAIL"": \n   T, R, A, I, L \n   R in position 2 -> but wait, we know R is not in position 2? So that would be inefficient. Therefore, avoid placing R in position 2.\n\n Therefore, words that have R in 2nd should be avoided? Yes.\n\n Other ideas: ""RAPID"", ""BARES"" (but B is new?), ""RASPY"", ""GRAPE"" (but E is disallowed? because we know E is not in the word? Yes, E is disallowed).\n\n So ""GRAPE"" is invalid because of E.\n\n How about ""DRAWL""? \n   D, R, A, W, L -> avoids C,N,E? \n   R is in 2nd -> avoid? Because we know R is not in 2nd? So don\'t use that.\n\n Alternatively, ""ARGUE""? \n   A, R, G, U, E -> but E is disallowed? Yes, we cannot use E.\n\n Another word: ""ORBIT""? \n   O, R, B, I, T -> but doesn\'t include A? We must include A because we know it\'s in the word? No, we have to include both R and A? We don\'t have to, but including them might help? Actually, we know both R and A are present. If we don\'t include them, we might get feedback that doesn\'t tell us about their positions? So we should try to include known letters to pin down their positions.\n\n Therefore, I think we should include both R and A.\n\n Let me prioritize including R and A in new positions.\n\n Possibilities:\n  R in position 1: words like R__?__ \n      R A ? ? ? : but also avoid position 3 for A? So A must be in 4th or 5th? Or position 2? \n      Example: ""RADIO""? -> R, A, D, I, O -> but A in position 2? That\'s okay? And avoid C,N,E? \n          Also, we don\'t have any restrictions for the other letters? \n      So ""RADIO"": \n        - R at 1: allowed \n        - A at 2: allowed? We don\'t know? Only 3rd is forbidden? So 2nd is open.\n        - D, I, O are new.\n\n  Alternatively, ""RASPY"": \n      R, A, S, P, Y \n      R at 1, A at 2 -> avoids C,N,E? \n      But same position for A? Well, position 2 is allowed? But what about R? Position 1 is allowed? \n\n  However, we also need to consider that we don\'t know if A can be at position 2? So we try?\n\n But note: the feedback only said A is not in the 3rd. It might very well be in the 2nd? So we can try.\n\n But also, we know R cannot be in the 2nd? And we are putting R in 1st? That\'s a new position? Good.\n\n However, let\'s check for other common words: ""PARTY"" -> P, A, R, T, Y -> \n   Positions: \n     A at 2nd -> allowed\n     R at 3rd -> allowed (because only 2nd is bad so far)\n   But R at 3rd? We don\'t know? So that could be? \n\n Compare: we have two known letters R and A, and we want to test them in positions we haven\'t tried? \n  For R, we only tried position 2? So now we can try position 1,3,4, or 5? \n  Similarly for A: we only tried position 3? So we can try 1,2,4,5.\n\n We also want to maximize new letter information.\n\n Perhaps ""PARTY"" is a good candidate? \n   Letters: P, A, R, T, Y -> all new? \n\n But note: in ""crane"", we didn\'t have P, T, Y? So that would introduce three new letters? And also use R and A.\n\n However, in ""PARTY"": \n   Position1: P -> new\n   Position2: A -> testing if A is there? \n   Position3: R -> testing if R is in 3rd? \n   Position4: T -> new\n   Position5: Y -> new\n\n But wait: we have R and A both in the word? And we are testing R at 3rd and A at 2nd? Which are both allowed? \n\n Alternatively, what about ""RABBI""? -> but that has repeated letters? And we don\'t know if repeated letters are in the word? Also, we should avoid repeats? Not necessary, but might be inefficient? But let\'s choose words with unique letters? \n\n Also, ""RABBI"" is not common? and has B and I? But also allows A in 2nd? \n\n Actually, we want to use distinct letters? Because if there are repeated letters we might get less information? \n\n So let\'s aim for distinct letters.\n\n Therefore, ""RADIO"" and ""PARTY"" and ""RASPY"" are candidates? \n\n But note: in the secret word, we don\'t know if there are repeated letters? So we could avoid repeating? And since the feedback doesn\'t indicate repetition? So we can assume distinct? \n\n Now, to decide: we want to cover more common vowels and consonants? \n\n Common vowels: A, O, I? We already have O and I in ""RADIO""? \n\n Common consonants: S, T, R? We have R and T and S? \n\n How about ""RAINS""? -> but N was disallowed? Because in first guess N was marked x? So not in word? So ""RAINS"" invalid? \n\n Similarly, ""CARES"" -> C is disallowed? \n\n So best candidate: ""RADIO"" vs ""PARTY"" vs ""RASPY""\n\n Let me pick ""PARTY"" because it has R and A in two new positions? And also introduces P, T, Y? \n\n Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" is invalid because if we put R in 2nd -> which we know is wrong? \n\n How about ""ROAST""? \n   We decided against because A is in 3rd? We know A is not in 3rd? So why repeat? \n\n Therefore, I think ""PARTY"" is a good choice.\n\n But what about the word ""PARKS""? \n   P, A, R, K, S -> A in 2nd? R in 3rd? Both allowed? And K and S are new? \n\n Also good? \n\n Maybe I\'ll choose a word that doesn\'t have R and A adjacent? \n\n Another candidate: ""FLAIR""? \n   F, L, A, I, R -> \n   A in position 3? But wait, we know A is not in position 3? So we cannot put A in 3rd? \n\n Therefore, ""FLAIR"" is invalid? \n\n How about ""STAIR""? \n   S, T, A, I, R -> \n   A in position 3 -> forbidden? So invalid.\n\n Alternative: ""ARTIS""? Wait, ARTIS is not a word? \n\n Let me pick a word: ""GRAPY""? Not a word.\n\n How about ""BRAVE""? \n   But B, R, A, V, E -> E is disallowed? \n\n ""FRAME"": has E? \n\n ""GLARE"": has E? \n\n ""SHARP"": \n   S, H, A, R, P -> \n   Position1: S\n   Position2: H\n   Position3: A -> but we cannot put A in 3rd? So invalid.\n\n ""HORDE"": has E? \n\n ""AMBER"": has E? \n\n ""PLAIN"": has N? disallowed.\n\n So back to: ""RASPY"", ""RADIO"", ""PARTY"", ""PARKS"".\n\n I think ""RADIO"" and ""PARTY"" are both good? \n  ""RADIO"": A in 2nd and R in 1st? \n  ""PARTY"": A in 2nd and R in 3rd? \n\n Which one? \n  For ""RADIO"": \n    If the word has R in 1st, we get a ✓ for R? \n    And A in 2nd, could it be? \n\n  For ""PARTY"": \n    A in 2nd and R in 3rd? \n\n Actually, we don\'t know? \n\n Another factor: We want to include common letters that we haven\'t tried? \n  First guess ""CRANE"" tested: C, R, A, N, E -> we know about R and A.\n\n  Therefore, we should introduce letters that aren\'t excluded: so letters like S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.\n\n  In ""RADIO"": D and I and O? \n  In ""PARTY"": P, T, Y? \n\n Common letters: T appears in a lot of words? So maybe including T is better? \n\n Also, note: we know the word doesn\'t have C, N, E? So we can use T? \n\n I think ""PARTY"" is a good choice? \n\n Alternatively, ""RUSTY"": \n   R, U, S, T, Y -> \n   R in 1st? \n   But A? We must include A? No, we don\'t have A? We know A is in the word, so if we don\'t include A, we won\'t get information about A\'s position? Then we\'ll have to guess it later? However, by including we can get feedback on A? \n\n But note: we already know A is in the word? Yes, so if we don\'t include it, then the feedback won\'t tell us anything about its position? So we might have to try again later? It\'s better to use it? \n\n Therefore, we must include A? Actually, no, we are not forced? But it\'s recommended? \n\n We have 6 guesses? And we might get information? So let\'s include both R and A? \n\n Therefore, I\'ll go with ""PARTY"".\n\n Guess: ""party""After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)), we know:\n- R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.\n- C, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.\n- We need a new guess that includes R and A in positions other than 2 (for R) and 3 (for A), while avoiding C, N, E.\n\nFor an optimal second guess:\n- Include R and A in untried positions to locate them (e.g., try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5, and A in 1, 2, 4, or 5).\n- Introduce new common letters like T, P, and Y to gather more information.\n- Avoid repeating the ineffective positions from the first guess.\n\n""party"" fits perfectly:\n- P, T, Y are new untested letters.\n- A is placed in position 2 (untried, since only position 3 was ruled out).\n- R is placed in position 3 (untried, since only position 2 was ruled out).\n- Uses distinct letters and excludes known absent letters (C, N, E).\n\nThis guess maximizes letter coverage and position testing for R and A.\n\n<guess>party</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(-) T(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> P(x), A(✓), R(-), T(x), Y(x)\n\nInterpretation:\n\nFrom Guess 1:\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was marked \'-\' meaning wrong position).\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked \'-\' meaning wrong position).\n- C, N, E are not in the word.\n\nFrom Guess 2:\n- A is correct in position 2 (marked \'✓\'). So the second letter of the secret word is A.\n- R is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and marked \'-\' wrong position).\n- P, T, Y are not in the word.\n\nAdditionally, from Guess 1, we know R is in the word but not in position 2.

Actually: \n- If R were in position 1, we did not test position 1? In Guess 1, we had R at position 2? So we haven\'t tested position 1? \nBut in Guess 2, we didn\'t have any letter at position 1? We had P at 1? That was absent? \n\nWe need to find a word that:\n- Has the second letter \'A\'.\n- Includes R (since R is present) in either position 1, 4, or 5? Note: we cannot put R in 2nd because it\'s A? And we cannot put R in 3rd? Because in Guess 2 we tried and it was wrong? So 1,4,5 are open? \n- Also, avoid the absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, Y.\n\nNow, we need more letters? So we should choose a word that has R in position 1, 4 or 5?

R ? \nOr position 5? ? A ? ? R? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nSo we need to test? \n\nHow about we try R in position 1? Since it hasn\'t been tested? \n\nBut also: we can choose a word that has R at 1, and includes other new letters? \n\nBut note: if R is in position 1, then in Guess1 we had R in 2nd? And we got R present? So why wasn\'t R marked as present due to position 1? Because in Guess1 there was no R at position 1? So it might be? \n\nAlternatively, if R is at position 4? Then in Guess1? We had R in position 2? Which doesn\'t conflict? \n\nSimilarly, position 5? \n\nBut since we are going to test? \n\nBut we can also choose a word that tests multiple possibilities? \n\nHowever, with the constraint that A is fixed? \n\nCommon words that fit: \n- ""RABID"": R at 1, A at 2? \n  Then unknown B, I, D? \n\nBut not very common? \n\nHow about ""RADII""? repeated I? and not common? \n\n""RASPS""? But P and S? P? but we know P is absent? P is banned? \n\nFrom Guess 2, P is absent? So we cannot use P? \n\nSimilarly, we cannot use T? \n\nSo letters banned: C,E,N,P,T,Y? \n\nTherefore, ""RABID"" is acceptable? \n\nBut perhaps we can try a more common word? \n\nHow about ""RAILS""? \n   R, A, I, L, S?\n   But position 1: R, position 2: A, position 3: I, position 4: L, position 5: S? \n   But we haven\'t tried I,L,S? \n   And avoid C,E,N,P,T,Y? Yes? \n\nBut ""RAILS"" is a word? \n\nAlso, we could test R at 1? \n\nSimilarly, we can test R at 4? Or 5? \n\nBut I think testing R at 1? Since we might get full word? \n\nAlso, having S and L might be helpful? \n\nBut note: if we put R in position 1, and the secret word has R at 1? Then we get ✓ for R? \n\nOtherwise, if R is not at 1, then we might get R marked as \'-\' if it is at 4 or 5? \n\nSo it helps pin down R\'s position? \n\nTherefore, I think ""RAILS"" is a good candidate? \n\nBut wait? Another possibility: ""BAKER""? But E? not allowed? \n\nOr ""DANCE""? N? not allowed? \n\nSo let me go with ""RAILS"".\n\nBut what if R is not at 1? Then we will get R marked as absent? But no? Because R is definitely in the word? So if we put R at 1? Then:\n- If R is at 1: then ✓\n- If R is not at 1? But since we have it? Then R should be marked as \'-\' meaning it\'s present but in wrong position? \n\nBecause R is present? So we cannot get R marked as \'x\'? Because we know R is present? So if we put R at 1? And R is actually at 4? Then we will get R marked as \'-\' meaning present but wrong position? \n\nAnd similarly? \n\nSo in any case, we get information about R\'s position? \n\nTherefore, ""RAILS"" is a valid guess: \n  Positions: \n    1: R? \n    2: A? Correct? \n    3: I? \n    4: L? \n    5: S? \n\nBut wait? position 2: A is fixed? So A will be correct? \n\nAnd we haven\'t tested I, L, S? \n\nAlternatively, if we think R might be at 4? Then we can try a word with R at 4? And another common letter? \n\nFor example: ""DAILY""? \n  D, A, I, L, Y? \n  But Y is disallowed? From Guess2? \n\nBecause Y in Guess2 was absent? So we cannot use Y? \n\nAnother one: ""MAILS""? \n  M, A, I, L, S? \n  Then we don\'t use R? But we must use R? Because we haven\'t tested R in positions 4 or 5? \n\nWe know R is present? So we should include it? So we must include R? \n\nTherefore, we need to use R in the guess? \n\nBut if we put R at 4? Then word: ? A ? R ? \n\nFor instance: ""SAVOR""? \n  But V and O? \n  But also S? \n  But avoid banned? \n\nBut we cannot test without R? \n\nSo to test R at 4? We try: ""BARREL""? not 5? \n\nWords: ""HAREM""? But E? disallowed? \n\n""CAROM""? C? disallowed? \n\n""ARMOR""? R repeated? \n\n""FARMS""? \n  F, A, R, M, S? \n  Then: position1: F? \n  position2: A? \n  position3: R? But wait? We know R is not in position 3? Because Guess2 had R at 3 and got \'-\', meaning R is not at 3? \n\nSo how can we put R at 3? We cannot? \n\nSo for position4: R? \nThen the word: ? A ? R ? \n\nNeed a letter at position1, position3, position5? \n\nFor example: ""HAIRY""? But Y? disallowed? \n\n""GAUDY""? G,A,U,D,Y? Y disallowed? \n\n""BASIC""? C disallowed? \n\n""VALID""? V,A,L,I,D? \nBut no R? \n\nSo difficult? \n\nBut we know R must be included? \n\nTherefore, we can try R at position1? Or position4? Or position5? \n\nHow about R at position4? Then: \n  Words: ...R \n  Positions: \n    1: some letter? \n    2: A? \n    3: some letter? \n    4: R? \n    5: some letter? \n\nExample: ""OARED""? has E? \n\n""FARES""? has E? \n\n""DARES""? has E? \n\n""LARKS""? \n  L, A, R, K, S? \n  Position1: L? \n  Position2: A? \n  Position3: R? But wait, position3? We know R cannot be in position3? Because Guess2 had R at 3 and it was marked as \'-\' meaning R is not at 3? \n\nIn ""LARKS"": R is at position3? Which we know is impossible? \n\nSo we cannot put R at position3? \n\nTherefore, any word that has R at position3? Would be inefficient? \n\nSimilarly, word with R at position4? Then how? \n\nFor ""FARMS"" from above? \n  F at 1, A at 2, R at 3? Oh, I see, I put R at 3 in ""FARMS""? That is invalid? We must avoid R at position3? \n\nTherefore, for position4? We need a word that has R at 4? \nExample: ""CHAIR""? But C? \n\n""PAIRS""? but P? banned? \n\n""HAIRS""? \n  H, A, I, R, S? \n  Then: \n    1: H? \n    2: A? \n    3: I? \n    4: R? \n    5: S? \n\nThis avoids C,E,N,P,T,Y? \n\nBut does ""HAIRS"" have R at 4? Yes? \n\nSimilarly, ""FRAUD""? \n  F,R,A,U,D -> R at 1? \n\nBut if we choose ""HAIRS"", then R is at position4? \n\nSimilarly, position5: R? Then word: ? A ? ? R? \nExample: ""KOALA""? not? \n\n""SONAR""? \n  S, O, N, A, R -> but N banned? \n\n""SUGAR""? \n  S, U, G, A, R -> \n  1: S? \n  2: U? but why? Position2 must be A? So we need A at 2? \n\nPattern: second letter must be A? \n\nSo for position5: R? ? A ? ? R? \n\nWord: ? A ? ? R? \n\nFor example: ""GLAMR""? not word? \n\n""FLAIR""? \n   F, L, A, I, R -> \n  1:F, 2:L? But 2 must be A? So not? \n\n""CHAOR""? not? \n\nSo it\'s hard? \n\nTherefore, easier to try R at position1? \n\nThus, I\'ll go with ""RAILS"". \n\nBut let\'s confirm: \n  ""RAILS"": \n    R, A, I, L, S? \n    Positions: \n        1: R -> new? \n        2: A -> we know ✓? \n        3: I -> new? \n        4: L -> new? \n        5: S -> new? \n\nAnd it avoids banned letters? \n\nYes? \n\nAnd if the secret word was ""RAILS""? We win? \n\nIf not, we get information about R? And I, L, S? \n\nAlternative: ""RABID"", but similar? \n\nBut ""RAILS"" seems common? \n\nOkay? \n\nBut note: we have already used 2 guesses? Now third? \n\nSo guess: ""rails"" or ""RAILS""? \n\nBut let me note: in Guess2, A was fixed? So this word has A at 2? So that will be guaranteed ✓? \n\nSo we only test R at 1 and the other letters? \n\nSo I think it\'s good? \n\nTherefore, I choose ""rails"".\n\nNote: we must use uppercase? But in the response we can use uppercase? \n\nIn the feedback examples? They used uppercase? \n\nBut in the guess output? We use lowercase? \n\nOr consistent? \n\nBut I think the application expects in the <guess> tag? \n\nSo I\'ll use lowercase? \n\nBut for clarity? \n\nActually, the first time I guessed ""crane"" and ""party"" in lowercase? \n\nSo I\'ll use ""rails"".\n\nBut let me confirm: is ""rails"" a valid word?

We have feedback from Guess 3: rails -> R(-) A(✓) I(x) L(x) S(-)
 Interpretation:
 - A is still correctly placed at position 2 (✓).
 - R is in the word but not in position 1 (since we guessed R at position 1 and got ""-"" meaning wrong position but present).
 - S is in the word but not in position 5 (since we guessed S at position 5 and got ""-"" meaning present but wrong position).
 - I and L are not in the word at all (x).

 So now we know:
 - The secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _
 - R is present, but not in position 1, 2 (from guess1), or 3 (from guess2). Therefore, R must be in position 4 or 5.
 - S is present, but not in position 5 (and we haven't tested other positions for S yet? We only tested it at position 5, so it could be in 1,3,4? But note: position 1 is now occupied by an unknown letter, and we know R is in 4 or 5, so S cannot be in 4 or 5? Wait, no: we only know S is not in 5, but it could be in 4? However, R is in 4 or 5, so if S is in 4, then R must be in 5? Or vice versa? But we don't know if they can share? Actually, we don't know about duplicates? But so far no duplicates in our guesses? We'll assume no duplicates until we see evidence? But the feedback doesn't show duplicates? Actually, the feedback for ""rails"" has R and S both marked as present but in wrong positions? So they are distinct? And we have no indication of duplicates? So we assume all letters are distinct? 

 Also, we have new absent letters: I and L are not in the word.

 So absent letters so far: C, E, N, P, T, Y, I, L.

 Now, the secret word has:
   Position 2: A (fixed)
   R must be in position 4 or 5.
   S must be in the word, but not in position 5? So it must be in position 1, 3, or 4? But note: position 4 might be taken by R? So we have to consider possibilities.

 However, we also know that R is in 4 or 5, and S is in the word but not in 5? So if S is not in 5, then S must be in 1, 3, or 4? But if R is in 4, then S cannot be in 4? So then S must be in 1 or 3? Similarly, if R is in 5, then S could be in 1, 3, or 4? But we don't know? 

 But note: we have position 1 still unknown? And position 3 unknown? 

 We also know the word has at least 3 distinct letters: A, R, S? And two more? 

 For the next guess, we need to:
   - Determine the position of R (either 4 or 5) and S (which must be in 1, 3, or 4, but constrained by R's position).
   - Avoid absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, Y, I, L.

 We can try to test both R and S in possible positions? 

 Let's list possible positions for R and S:

 Case 1: R in position 4 -> then S must be in 1 or 3 (since not 5 and not 4 because R is there? and we assume distinct).
 Case 2: R in position 5 -> then S can be in 1, 3, or 4.

 We also need to fill position 3? 

 We can design a guess that tests:
   - Position 1: a new letter or S? 
   - Position 3: a new letter or S?
   - Position 4: R? (if we want to test R at 4) or a new letter?
   - Position 5: R? (if we test R at 5) or a new letter?

 But note: we have two unknowns: the letter at position 1 and position 3? And we know R and S must be placed? 

 We can try to test R at position 4 and S at position 1? Or R at position 5 and S at position 3? 

 We want to maximize information? 

 Also, we have to avoid the absent letters? 

 Available letters: D, G, H, M, O, U, B, F, K, V, W, X, Z? (and S and R, but we know they are present? So we must include them? Actually, we don't have to? But if we don't, we might not get information about their positions? So we should include them? 

 We know R and S are present? So we must include them? 

 Therefore, the next guess must include R and S? 

 Now, we have to place R and S in positions that are possible? 

 For R: only positions 4 or 5? 
 For S: positions 1, 3, or 4? But if we put R in 4, then S cannot be in 4? So S must be in 1 or 3? Similarly, if we put R in 5, then S can be in 1,3,4? 

 We can try two strategies:
   Strategy A: Assume R is in position 4. Then put R at 4 and S at 1? 
   Strategy B: Assume R is in position 5. Then put R at 5 and S at 3? 

 But we don't know? So we can choose a word that tests one of these? 

 However, we can also test both possibilities? 

 How about a word that has:
   Position 1: S (to test if S is at 1)
   Position 4: R (to test if R is at 4)
   Position 5: a new letter? 

 But if R is at 4 and S at 1, then we get both? But if R is at 5, then we are putting R at 4? That would be wrong? And we get feedback that R is not at 4? Then we know R must be at 5? 

 Similarly, if we put S at 1 and it's not there? Then we know S must be at 3? 

 So let's design a word: 
   Position 1: S
   Position 2: A (fixed)
   Position 3: a new letter, say O? 
   Position 4: R
   Position 5: a new letter, say U? 

 Word: S A O R U? Is ""saoru"" a word? No.

 How about S A D O R? -> ""sador"" not a word? 

 S A B O R? ""sabor"" is a word? Meaning flavor in Spanish? But we need English? 

 S A V O R? ""savor"" is an English word? Yes! 

 But we haven't tested V? 

 So ""savor"": 
   S at 1, A at 2, V at 3, O at 4, R at 5? 

 But wait: we are testing R at position 5? But we also want to test R at 4? In this word, we put R at 5? 

 Alternatively, to test R at 4: 
   We can do: S A ? R ? 

 How about ""saber""? But E is absent? 

 ""sagor""? not a word? 

 ""sarod""? It's a word? But not common? 

 How about ""sabir""? Not a word? 

 Another idea: ""shard""? 
   S at 1, H at 2? But position 2 is fixed as A? So we cannot change A? 

 Position 2 is fixed? So we must have A at 2? 

 Therefore, we need a word: S A ? R ? 

 And the last letter? 

 How about ""safer""? But E is absent? 

 ""saker""? ""saker"" is a bird? But K is available? 

 ""saker"": S A K E R -> but E is absent? 

 ""sapor""? Not common? 

 ""sabre""? But E is absent? 

 ""sadhe""? E absent? 

 It's hard? 

 How about ""sarky""? But Y is absent? 

 We have to avoid absent letters: C,E,N,P,T,Y,I,L? 

 So available: D, G, H, M, O, U, B, F, K, V, W, X, Z? 

 Let me try: 
   S A V R ? -> but we need a letter at position 5? And we have R at 4? So position 5 must be a new letter? 

 But the word must be S A ? R ? 

 How about ""sabre"" is invalid? 

 Another word: ""samir""? Not a word? 

 ""safar""? Not a word? 

 ""sagum""? Not common? 

 How about ""sarod""? It is a word (a musical instrument)? 

 But let's use a more common word? 

 Alternatively, we can test R at 5? 

 Then we can have: 
   Position 1: S? 
   Position 3: S? 
   Position 4: a new letter? 
   Position 5: R? 

 How about: 
   Word: D A S H R? ""dashr"" not a word? 

   M A R S H? But we have A at 2, then R at 3? But we know R is not at 3? From guess2? 

   We cannot put R at 3? 

   So we need to avoid R at 3? 

   How about: 
      Position 1: S? 
      Position 3: a new letter? 
      Position 4: a new letter? 
      Position 5: R? 

   Example: S A U D R? ""saudr"" not a word? 

   S A B O R? ""sabor"" not English? 

   S A V O R? ""savor"" is good? 

   But in ""savor"": 
        S at 1, A at 2, V at 3, O at 4, R at 5? 

   This tests:
        S at position 1: if it's correct? 
        R at position 5: if it's correct? 
        Also, we test V and O? 

   But note: we know R must be in 4 or 5? So if we put R at 5, we are testing one of the possibilities? 

   Also, we are testing S at 1? 

   If the feedback shows:
        If R is at 5, then we get R(✓) at 5? 
        If R is at 4, then we get R(-) at 5? meaning R is present but not at 5? then we know R must be at 4? 

   Similarly, if S is at 1, we get S(✓) or S(-)? 

   So ""savor"" is a valid word? 

   But we have to check if it uses absent letters? 
        S: new? 
        A: fixed? 
        V: new? 
        O: new? 
        R: present? 

   And no absent letters? 

   So I think ""savor"" is a good guess? 

   Alternatively, we can test R at 4? 

   How about ""sharn""? But N is absent? 

   ""shard"" but we cannot because position 2 is fixed? 

   We need a word: ? A ? R ? and include S? 

   How about ""dashr"" not a word? 

   ""maser""? M A S E R -> E absent? 

   ""baser""? E absent? 

   ""haste""? E absent? 

   ""gaser""? E absent? 

   ""masur""? ""masur"" is not common? 

   ""raspy"" but Y absent? 

   ""rasps""? S at 5? But we know S is not at 5? from guess3? 

   In guess3, we had S at 5 and got S(-) meaning S is present but not at 5? So we can put S at 1,3,4? 

   How about ""sarsa""? Not a word? 

   I think ""savor"" is the best we can do? 

   Another option: ""sabre"" is invalid? 

   ""safer"" invalid? 

   ""sager"" E absent? 

   So I'll go with ""savor"". 

   But note: in ""savor"", we are putting R at 5? and S at 1? 

   We are not testing position 3? 

   But we are testing V at 3? 

   If we get feedback that S is not at 1? Then we know S must be at 3? (because if R is at 4, then S cannot be at 4? and not at 5? so only 3? Or if R is at 5, then S can be at 3 or 4? But we are putting R at 5? So if R is at 5, then S could be at 3 or 4? But we are testing S at 1? So if S is not at 1, then it must be at 3 or 4? 

   But we can deduce? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests S at 3? 

   How about: 
        Position 1: new letter? 
        Position 3: S? 
        Position 4: R? 
        Position 5: new letter? 

   Word: ? A S R ? 

   Example: ""baser"" invalid? 

   ""maser"" invalid? 

   ""gasr""? not a word? 

   ""oasr""? not a word? 

   ""hasr""? not a word? 

   ""dasr""? not a word? 

   ""wasr""? not a word? 

   ""fasr""? not a word? 

   ""kasr""? not common? 

   ""masr""? not common? 

   So I think ""savor"" is the best option? 

   Let me check: ""savor"" is a valid English word? Yes? 

   So we'll guess ""savor"". 

   But note: we are putting R at 5? and we are testing if R is at 5? 

   If R is at 4, then we get R(-) at 5? meaning R is present but not at 5? then we know R must be at 4? 

   And if R is at 5, we get R(✓)? 

   Similarly, S at 1: if it's correct? 

   Also, we test V and O? 

   So it's a good guess? 

   Therefore, next guess: ""savor"" 

   But wait: we have to write it in the format? 

   However, the user said ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and we are at guess 4? 

   So: 

<guess>savor</guess>
</think>
### Previous Feedback Summary:
- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
- **Guess 2: party** → P(x), A(✓), R(-), T(x), Y(x)  
- **Guess 3: rails** → R(-), A(✓), I(x), L(x), S(-)  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Pattern**: `_ A _ _ _` (A is fixed at position 2).  
2. **R's position**: Must be at **position 4 or 5** (excluded from positions 1, 2, 3).  
3. **S's status**: Present but not at position 5 (marked ""-"" in Guess 3).  
4. **Absent letters**: C, E, N, P, T, Y, I, L (avoid these).  
5. **New constraints**:  
   - S must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (not 5).  
   - R and S cannot share positions (assume distinct letters).  

### Strategy for Fourth Guess:
- **Test R at position 5** (last untested position for R).  
- **Test S at position 1** (high-priority starter position).  
- Introduce **new common letters** (V, O) to maximize information.  
- Avoid all absent letters.  
- Choose **""savor""**:  
  - S at 1 (tests S in a new position).  
  - A at 2 (fixed ✓).  
  - V and O at 3 and 4 (new letters).  
  - R at 5 (tests R in last possible position).  

### Why ""savor""?
- If R is at 5, feedback will confirm (✓). If not, R must be at 4.  
- If S is at 1, feedback will confirm (✓). If not, S must be at 3 or 4.  
- V and O test high-frequency letters in untested positions.  

<guess>savor</guess>",savor,"We have feedback from Guess 3: rails -> R(-) A(✓) I(x) L(x) S(-)
 Interpretation:
 - A is still correctly placed at position 2 (✓).
 - R is in the word but not in position 1 (since we guessed R at position 1 and got ""-"" meaning wrong position but present).
 - S is in the word but not in position 5 (since we guessed S at position 5 and got ""-"" meaning present but wrong position).
 - I and L are not in the word at all (x).

 So now we know:
 - The secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _
 - R is present, but not in position 1, 2 (from guess1), or 3 (from guess2). Therefore, R must be in position 4 or 5.
 - S is present, but not in position 5 (and we haven't tested other positions for S yet? We only tested it at position 5, so it could be in 1,3,4? But note: position 1 is now occupied by an unknown letter, and we know R is in 4 or 5, so S cannot be in 4 or 5? Wait, no: we only know S is not in 5, but it could be in 4? However, R is in 4 or 5, so if S is in 4, then R must be in 5? Or vice versa? But we don't know if they can share? Actually, we don't know about duplicates? But so far no duplicates in our guesses? We'll assume no duplicates until we see evidence? But the feedback doesn't show duplicates? Actually, the feedback for ""rails"" has R and S both marked as present but in wrong positions? So they are distinct? And we have no indication of duplicates? So we assume all letters are distinct? 

 Also, we have new absent letters: I and L are not in the word.

 So absent letters so far: C, E, N, P, T, Y, I, L.

 Now, the secret word has:
   Position 2: A (fixed)
   R must be in position 4 or 5.
   S must be in the word, but not in position 5? So it must be in position 1, 3, or 4? But note: position 4 might be taken by R? So we have to consider possibilities.

 However, we also know that R is in 4 or 5, and S is in the word but not in 5? So if S is not in 5, then S must be in 1, 3, or 4? But if R is in 4, then S cannot be in 4? So then S must be in 1 or 3? Similarly, if R is in 5, then S could be in 1, 3, or 4? But we don't know? 

 But note: we have position 1 still unknown? And position 3 unknown? 

 We also know the word has at least 3 distinct letters: A, R, S? And two more? 

 For the next guess, we need to:
   - Determine the position of R (either 4 or 5) and S (which must be in 1, 3, or 4, but constrained by R's position).
   - Avoid absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, Y, I, L.

 We can try to test both R and S in possible positions? 

 Let's list possible positions for R and S:

 Case 1: R in position 4 -> then S must be in 1 or 3 (since not 5 and not 4 because R is there? and we assume distinct).
 Case 2: R in position 5 -> then S can be in 1, 3, or 4.

 We also need to fill position 3? 

 We can design a guess that tests:
   - Position 1: a new letter or S? 
   - Position 3: a new letter or S?
   - Position 4: R? (if we want to test R at 4) or a new letter?
   - Position 5: R? (if we test R at 5) or a new letter?

 But note: we have two unknowns: the letter at position 1 and position 3? And we know R and S must be placed? 

 We can try to test R at position 4 and S at position 1? Or R at position 5 and S at position 3? 

 We want to maximize information? 

 Also, we have to avoid the absent letters? 

 Available letters: D, G, H, M, O, U, B, F, K, V, W, X, Z? (and S and R, but we know they are present? So we must include them? Actually, we don't have to? But if we don't, we might not get information about their positions? So we should include them? 

 We know R and S are present? So we must include them? 

 Therefore, the next guess must include R and S? 

 Now, we have to place R and S in positions that are possible? 

 For R: only positions 4 or 5? 
 For S: positions 1, 3, or 4? But if we put R in 4, then S cannot be in 4? So S must be in 1 or 3? Similarly, if we put R in 5, then S can be in 1,3,4? 

 We can try two strategies:
   Strategy A: Assume R is in position 4. Then put R at 4 and S at 1? 
   Strategy B: Assume R is in position 5. Then put R at 5 and S at 3? 

 But we don't know? So we can choose a word that tests one of these? 

 However, we can also test both possibilities? 

 How about a word that has:
   Position 1: S (to test if S is at 1)
   Position 4: R (to test if R is at 4)
   Position 5: a new letter? 

 But if R is at 4 and S at 1, then we get both? But if R is at 5, then we are putting R at 4? That would be wrong? And we get feedback that R is not at 4? Then we know R must be at 5? 

 Similarly, if we put S at 1 and it's not there? Then we know S must be at 3? 

 So let's design a word: 
   Position 1: S
   Position 2: A (fixed)
   Position 3: a new letter, say O? 
   Position 4: R
   Position 5: a new letter, say U? 

 Word: S A O R U? Is ""saoru"" a word? No.

 How about S A D O R? -> ""sador"" not a word? 

 S A B O R? ""sabor"" is a word? Meaning flavor in Spanish? But we need English? 

 S A V O R? ""savor"" is an English word? Yes! 

 But we haven't tested V? 

 So ""savor"": 
   S at 1, A at 2, V at 3, O at 4, R at 5? 

 But wait: we are testing R at position 5? But we also want to test R at 4? In this word, we put R at 5? 

 Alternatively, to test R at 4: 
   We can do: S A ? R ? 

 How about ""saber""? But E is absent? 

 ""sagor""? not a word? 

 ""sarod""? It's a word? But not common? 

 How about ""sabir""? Not a word? 

 Another idea: ""shard""? 
   S at 1, H at 2? But position 2 is fixed as A? So we cannot change A? 

 Position 2 is fixed? So we must have A at 2? 

 Therefore, we need a word: S A ? R ? 

 And the last letter? 

 How about ""safer""? But E is absent? 

 ""saker""? ""saker"" is a bird? But K is available? 

 ""saker"": S A K E R -> but E is absent? 

 ""sapor""? Not common? 

 ""sabre""? But E is absent? 

 ""sadhe""? E absent? 

 It's hard? 

 How about ""sarky""? But Y is absent? 

 We have to avoid absent letters: C,E,N,P,T,Y,I,L? 

 So available: D, G, H, M, O, U, B, F, K, V, W, X, Z? 

 Let me try: 
   S A V R ? -> but we need a letter at position 5? And we have R at 4? So position 5 must be a new letter? 

 But the word must be S A ? R ? 

 How about ""sabre"" is invalid? 

 Another word: ""samir""? Not a word? 

 ""safar""? Not a word? 

 ""sagum""? Not common? 

 How about ""sarod""? It is a word (a musical instrument)? 

 But let's use a more common word? 

 Alternatively, we can test R at 5? 

 Then we can have: 
   Position 1: S? 
   Position 3: S? 
   Position 4: a new letter? 
   Position 5: R? 

 How about: 
   Word: D A S H R? ""dashr"" not a word? 

   M A R S H? But we have A at 2, then R at 3? But we know R is not at 3? From guess2? 

   We cannot put R at 3? 

   So we need to avoid R at 3? 

   How about: 
      Position 1: S? 
      Position 3: a new letter? 
      Position 4: a new letter? 
      Position 5: R? 

   Example: S A U D R? ""saudr"" not a word? 

   S A B O R? ""sabor"" not English? 

   S A V O R? ""savor"" is good? 

   But in ""savor"": 
        S at 1, A at 2, V at 3, O at 4, R at 5? 

   This tests:
        S at position 1: if it's correct? 
        R at position 5: if it's correct? 
        Also, we test V and O? 

   But note: we know R must be in 4 or 5? So if we put R at 5, we are testing one of the possibilities? 

   Also, we are testing S at 1? 

   If the feedback shows:
        If R is at 5, then we get R(✓) at 5? 
        If R is at 4, then we get R(-) at 5? meaning R is present but not at 5? then we know R must be at 4? 

   Similarly, if S is at 1, we get S(✓) or S(-)? 

   So ""savor"" is a valid word? 

   But we have to check if it uses absent letters? 
        S: new? 
        A: fixed? 
        V: new? 
        O: new? 
        R: present? 

   And no absent letters? 

   So I think ""savor"" is a good guess? 

   Alternatively, we can test R at 4? 

   How about ""sharn""? But N is absent? 

   ""shard"" but we cannot because position 2 is fixed? 

   We need a word: ? A ? R ? and include S? 

   How about ""dashr"" not a word? 

   ""maser""? M A S E R -> E absent? 

   ""baser""? E absent? 

   ""haste""? E absent? 

   ""gaser""? E absent? 

   ""masur""? ""masur"" is not common? 

   ""raspy"" but Y absent? 

   ""rasps""? S at 5? But we know S is not at 5? from guess3? 

   In guess3, we had S at 5 and got S(-) meaning S is present but not at 5? So we can put S at 1,3,4? 

   How about ""sarsa""? Not a word? 

   I think ""savor"" is the best we can do? 

   Another option: ""sabre"" is invalid? 

   ""safer"" invalid? 

   ""sager"" E absent? 

   So I'll go with ""savor"". 

   But note: in ""savor"", we are putting R at 5? and S at 1? 

   We are not testing position 3? 

   But we are testing V at 3? 

   If we get feedback that S is not at 1? Then we know S must be at 3? (because if R is at 4, then S cannot be at 4? and not at 5? so only 3? Or if R is at 5, then S can be at 3 or 4? But we are putting R at 5? So if R is at 5, then S could be at 3 or 4? But we are testing S at 1? So if S is not at 1, then it must be at 3 or 4? 

   But we can deduce? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests S at 3? 

   How about: 
        Position 1: new letter? 
        Position 3: S? 
        Position 4: R? 
        Position 5: new letter? 

   Word: ? A S R ? 

   Example: ""baser"" invalid? 

   ""maser"" invalid? 

   ""gasr""? not a word? 

   ""oasr""? not a word? 

   ""hasr""? not a word? 

   ""dasr""? not a word? 

   ""wasr""? not a word? 

   ""fasr""? not a word? 

   ""kasr""? not common? 

   ""masr""? not common? 

   So I think ""savor"" is the best option? 

   Let me check: ""savor"" is a valid English word? Yes? 

   So we'll guess ""savor"". 

   But note: we are putting R at 5? and we are testing if R is at 5? 

   If R is at 4, then we get R(-) at 5? meaning R is present but not at 5? then we know R must be at 4? 

   And if R is at 5, we get R(✓)? 

   Similarly, S at 1: if it's correct? 

   Also, we test V and O? 

   So it's a good guess? 

   Therefore, next guess: ""savor"" 

   But wait: we have to write it in the format? 

   However, the user said ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and we are at guess 4? 

   So:
