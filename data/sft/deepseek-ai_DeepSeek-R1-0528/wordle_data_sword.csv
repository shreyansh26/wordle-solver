 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word that includes common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

I'm starting the game and need to make my first guess. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of possibilities. 

The word ""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It contains three vowels (A and E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
- The letters C, R, A, N, and E are all high-frequency in English 5-letter words.
- This combination helps test multiple letter positions at once, which will provide useful feedback for narrowing down the secret word.

We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(-) -> R is in the secret word but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it's marked as wrong position).
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.
 E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position.
 - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Since R is in the word but not in position 2, it must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 We need to make a second guess that:
 1. Does not contain C, A, N, E (since they are absent).
 2. Contains the letter R, but not in the second position.
 3. Uses other common letters to test for presence.

 We also note that the secret word has 5 letters and we have to avoid the absent letters.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible: 
   Vowels: We know A and E are out, so we have I, O, U (and sometimes Y). But note that the word must have at least one vowel (or Y). 
   Consonants: We have R already, and we can use other common ones like T, S, L, etc.

 However, we must avoid C, A, N, E.

 Since R is present, we can try to put R in a different position (not position 2) and use other common letters.

 Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5.

 Let's try to form a word that includes R and uses other common letters that haven't been tested.

 Common consonants (besides R) that we haven't tried: T, S, L, D, M, P, etc.
 Vowels: I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

 We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 A good candidate might be a word that has R in the first position? But note, we don't know if R is in position 1. We can try.

 Alternatively, we can try R in the third, fourth, or fifth position.

 Let's consider some words:

 Option 1: R in the first position: e.g., ""ROTIS"" (but note we must use only 5 letters and avoid A, E, N, C). 
   However, we don't know if O is in the word? We haven't tested O.

 Option 2: R in the third position: e.g., ""BIRDS"" (B, I, R, D, S) -> but we haven't tested B, I, D, S.

 Option 3: R in the fourth position: e.g., ""STORY"" (S, T, O, R, Y) -> but we haven't tested S, T, O, Y.

 Option 4: R in the fifth position: e.g., ""MIRTH"" (M, I, R, T, H) -> but we haven't tested M, I, T, H.

 We want to maximize information. Let's choose a word that has multiple common letters and avoids the absent ones.

 I think ""STORY"" is a good candidate because:
   - It has R in the fourth position (which is different from the second, so we are testing a new position).
   - It introduces S, T, O, Y (all common letters).

 But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""STORY"" is a valid English word.

 Alternatively, we could use ""ROUST"" (R in first, O, U, S, T) but that uses U which is less common.

 Another option: ""SPORT"" (S, P, O, R, T) -> R in the fourth position.

 However, we have to avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E. Both ""STORY"" and ""SPORT"" avoid these.

 Let me check the frequency of letters: 
   S, T, O are very common. Y is less common but we are testing it.

 Another candidate: ""TRIOS"" (T, R, I, O, S) -> R in the second position? But wait, we already know R is not in the second position. So we cannot put R in the second position again because we know it's not there. 

 Therefore, we must avoid putting R in the second position.

 In ""STORY"": 
   S (position 1), T (position 2), O (position 3), R (position 4), Y (position 5).

 This avoids the second position for R.

 Similarly, ""SPORT"": S (1), P (2), O (3), R (4), T (5).

 Both are valid.

 But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible. ""STORY"" uses S, T, O, R, Y. 
 ""SPORT"" uses S, P, O, R, T. 

 The letter T is in both, but in ""STORY"" we have Y and in ""SPORT"" we have P. 

 Since we have limited guesses, we might prefer to test more common letters. T is more common than P and Y.

 However, we can also consider ""ROBOT"" (R in first, O, B, O, T) -> but that has two O's and we don't know if O is in the word. Also, we are repeating O? Actually, it's valid, but we are using O twice. It might be less efficient.

 Another idea: ""DIRTY"" (D, I, R, T, Y) -> R in the third position.

 But note: we don't know if D, I, T, Y are in the word.

 I think ""STORY"" is a solid choice.

 However, let me think of a word that uses R and also tests other vowels. We know A and E are out, so we have I, O, U. 

 We haven't tested I, O, U. 

 We can try a word that has one of these vowels and R in a new position.

 I'll go with ""STORY"" for the second guess.

 So, the second guess: STORY

 We'll see the feedback and then adjust accordingly.
</think>
<thought>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, A, N, and E are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- R is present but not in the second position (marked ""-"").

Key deductions:
1. The secret word contains R, but it must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is incorrect).
2. The word cannot contain C, A, N, or E.
3. We need to test new high-frequency letters (like S, T, O, L, I) to gather more information.

For the second guess:
- Must include R in a position other than 2 (to verify its location).
- Should avoid C, A, N, E entirely.
- Prioritize common untested letters (S, T, O, I, L, etc.) to maximize feedback.

A strong candidate is ""STORY"":
- Places R in position 4 (testing a new location).
- Introduces new common letters: S, T, O, Y.
- Avoids all excluded letters (C, A, N, E).
- If R is actually in position 4, we'll get a ""✓""; if not, we'll learn about other positions for R and the presence of S/T/O/Y.

This guess efficiently narrows possibilities while adhering to feedback constraints.

 Another candidate: ""TRIOS"" (T, R, I, O, S) -> R in the second position? But wait, we already know R is not in the second position. So we cannot put R in the second position again because we know it's not there. 

 Therefore, we must avoid putting R in the second position.

 In ""STORY"": 
   S (position 1), T (position 2), O (position 3), R (position 4), Y (position 5).

 This avoids the second position for R.

 Similarly, ""SPORT"": S (1), P (2), O (3), R (4), T (5).

 Both are valid.

 But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible. ""STORY"" uses S, T, O, R, Y. 
 ""SPORT"" uses S, P, O, R, T. 

 The letter T is in both, but in ""STORY"" we have Y and in ""SPORT"" we have P. 

 Since we have limited guesses, we might prefer to test more common letters. T is more common than P and Y.

 However, we can also consider ""ROBOT"" (R in first, O, B, O, T) -> but that has two O's and we don't know if O is in the word. Also, we are repeating O? Actually, it's valid, but we are using O twice. It might be less efficient.

 Another idea: ""DIRTY"" (D, I, R, T, Y) -> R in the third position.

 But note: we don't know if D, I, T, Y are in the word.

 I think ""STORY"" is a solid choice.

 However, let me think of a word that uses R and also tests other vowels. We know A and E are out, so we have I, O, U. 

 We haven't tested I, O, U. 

 We can try a word that has one of these vowels and R in a new position.

 I'll go with ""STORY"" for the second guess.

 So, the second guess: STORY

 We'll see the feedback and then adjust accordingly.<thought>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, A, N, and E are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- R is present but not in the second position (marked ""-"").

Key deductions:
1. The secret word contains R, but it must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is incorrect).
2. The word cannot contain C, A, N, or E.
3. We need to test new high-frequency letters (like S, T, O, L, I) to gather more information.

For the second guess:
- Must include R in a position other than 2 (to verify its location).
- Should avoid C, A, N, E entirely.
- Prioritize common untested letters (S, T, O, I, L, etc.) to maximize feedback.

A strong candidate is ""STORY"":
- Places R in position 4 (testing a new location).
- Introduces new common letters: S, T, O, Y.
- Avoids all excluded letters (C, A, N, E).
- If R is actually in position 4, we'll get a ""✓""; if not, we'll learn about other positions for R and the presence of S/T/O/Y.

This guess efficiently narrows possibilities while adhering to feedback constraints.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, A, N, E are absent (not in the word at all).
- R is present but not in position 2.

Guess 2: STORY -> Feedback: S(✓) T(x) O(✓) R(✓) Y(x)
Meaning:
- S is correct and in position 1 (since it's the first letter and marked ✓).
- T is absent (x) — so T is not in the word at all.
- O is correct and in position 3 (since it's the third letter and marked ✓).
- R is correct and in position 4 (since it's the fourth letter and marked ✓).
- Y is absent (x) — so Y is not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has S in position 1, O in position 3, and R in position 4.
- The word does not contain: C, A, N, E, T, Y.
- The remaining unknown positions are position 2 and position 5.

So the current pattern is: S _ O R _

We need to fill in the second and fifth positions with letters that are not in the excluded list (C, A, N, E, T, Y) and are likely to form a valid English word.

Possible letters for position 2 and 5: 
- We must avoid: C, A, N, E, T, Y.
- We can use other consonants and vowels. But note that we have already used S, O, R. The word must have exactly 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but we don't have information about duplicates yet.

However, from the feedback, we know that T and Y are absent, so they cannot be in the word.

We also know that the word has S, O, R, and two more letters (one in position 2 and one in position 5). Since R is already placed and we have no indication of duplicates, we assume no duplicates for now.

Common letters that are still available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

But we need to form a word that fits S _ O R _

Let's think of words that start with S, have O in the third position, R in the fourth, and then a fifth letter.

Some possibilities:
- S H O R ? -> SHORE, SHORN, SHORT, etc. But T is absent, so SHORT is invalid. SHORE has E which is absent. SHORN has N which is absent. So not SHOR?.
- S C O R ? -> SCORN, SCORE, but C is absent and N, E are absent. Invalid.
- S P O R ? -> SPORE (E absent), SPORT (T absent), so invalid.
- S L O R ? -> SLORM? (not a word), or SLOSH? (but O is in third, not second). 
- S K O R ? -> SKORT (but T is absent) and not common.
- S M O R ? -> SMORE (E absent), SMORG (not a word).
- S B O R ? -> SBORE (not a word), SBORN (not a word).
- S F O R ? -> SFORZ? (not 5 letters), not common.
- S W O R ? -> SWORD (D is a possibility, and D is not excluded). SWORD: S W O R D -> positions: S(1), W(2), O(3), R(4), D(5). 
  - Check against exclusions: W and D are not in the excluded list (C,A,N,E,T,Y). So SWORD is a candidate.

But wait, we have S(✓) from the second guess, meaning S is in position 1. In SWORD, S is in position 1, which matches. O is in position 3 (matches), R in position 4 (matches). So SWORD fits the pattern.

Are there other words?
- S H O R ? -> We already saw SHORE, SHORN, SHORT are invalid. What about SHORL? (a mineral, but not common). 
- S N O R ? -> but N is excluded.
- S G O R ? -> not a word.
- S D O R ? -> SDORR? not a word.

Another possibility: S O R with a letter in between? But the pattern is S _ O R _, so the second letter is between S and O, and then the fifth.

What about ""SOLAR""? But SOLAR has L in position 2 and A in position 5? But A is excluded. And also, O is in position 2? No, in SOLAR: S(1), O(2), L(3), A(4), R(5). But our pattern requires O in position 3 and R in position 4. So SOLAR doesn't fit.

Another: ""SORRY""? But SORRY: S(1), O(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5). But we have O in position 2? Our pattern requires O in position 3 and R in position 4. Also, Y is excluded. So invalid.

Another: ""SOFAR""? But O is in position 2, not 3. And A and F? A is excluded.

So, back to SWORD: it seems a strong candidate.

But let's check if there are others.

What about ""SCOUR""? But C is excluded, and O is in position 3? SCOUR: S(1), C(2), O(3), U(4), R(5). But we need R in position 4, not 5. And C is excluded. So no.

""SPURN"": P is allowed, but U and N? N is excluded. And R is in position 4? SPURN: S(1), P(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). But N is excluded. So invalid.

""SHIRK"": H, I, R, K. Pattern: S(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), K(5). But we need O in position 3, not I. So doesn't fit.

""SMOKY"": M, O, K, Y. But O is in position 3? SMOKY: S(1), M(2), O(3), K(4), Y(5). But Y is excluded, and we need R in position 4, not K. So no.

Therefore, the only common word that fits the pattern and avoids excluded letters is SWORD.

But wait, what about ""SHOWY""? But O is in position 3? SHOWY: S(1), H(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5). But we need R in position 4, not W. And Y is excluded. So no.

Another: ""SCOWL"": C and L, but C excluded, and O in position 3, but we need R in 4.

So, SWORD seems to be the only common word.

But let's confirm the pattern: S _ O R _ 
- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 2: unknown (must be a letter not excluded: so not C,A,N,E,T,Y)
- Position 3: O (fixed)
- Position 4: R (fixed)
- Position 5: unknown (same constraints)

SWORD: S (1), W (2), O (3), R (4), D (5). W and D are not excluded.

Are there any other words?
- ""SWORE"": but E is excluded.
- ""SWORN"": N is excluded.
- ""SWORD"" is the only one.

What about ""STORK""? But T is excluded.

Or ""SPORK""? P and K, but O is in position 3? SPORK: S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), K(5). That could work? But is SPORK a word? It's a portmanteau of spoon and fork, and it's accepted in some dictionaries. But let's check exclusions: P and K are not excluded (C,A,N,E,T,Y). So SPORK is a possibility.

But is it more common than SWORD? Probably not, but it's a valid guess.

However, we have two candidates: SWORD and SPORK.

But note: in the feedback from the second guess, we have T marked as absent. In SPORK, there is no T, so that's fine. Similarly, SWORD has no T.

But we need to choose one. Since we are trying to guess the word, and SWORD is a more common word, I'll go with SWORD.

But wait, what if the word is SPORK? We have to consider both.

However, in the context of the game, the secret word is likely a common word. SWORD is more common than SPORK.

Moreover, we have no reason to prefer SPORK over SWORD at this point.

But note: we have only one unknown position? Actually, two: positions 2 and 5.

In SWORD, we are guessing W and D.

In SPORK, we are guessing P and K.

We don't have any information about W, D, P, or K yet.

But we can only guess one word.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests more letters? But we already have three letters fixed (S, O, R) and only two unknown. So we can guess the word directly.

But to be safe, we might consider if there are other possibilities.

Another word: ""SHORL"" — but that's not common and has H and L. But we don't know about H and L. However, SHORL: S(1), H(2), O(3), R(4), L(5). H and L are not excluded. But is SHORL a valid word? It's a mineral, but very obscure. Probably not the secret word.

Similarly, ""SWOOP"": S(1), W(2), O(3), O(4), P(5). But we have two O's? And we need R in position 4, not O. So doesn't fit.

""SWOON"": S(1), W(2), O(3), O(4), N(5). Again, no R in position 4 and N is excluded.

So, between SWORD and SPORK, SWORD is more likely.

But let's see if there is a word with a vowel in position 2? For example, ""SOUR""? But that's 4 letters. ""SOURS"" — but that would be S(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), S(5). But we need O in position 3, not 2. So no.

""SAVOR"": but A is excluded.

Therefore, the most probable word is SWORD.

But note: we have feedback that in the first guess, R was present but not in position 2, and now we have R in position 4. Also, S in position 1 and O in position 3.

So, I think SWORD is the best guess.

But to be thorough, let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and avoid excluded letters:

- SWORD: W and D
- SPORK: P and K
- SHORL: H and L (but obscure)
- SMORG: not a word
- SWIRL: but I in position 3? SWIRL: S(1), W(2), I(3), R(4), L(5). But we need O in position 3, not I. So invalid.

Another: ""SABOR"" — but A is excluded.

""SEGOR"" — E excluded.

So, only two real candidates: SWORD and SPORK.

Given that, and since we have to guess, I'll choose SWORD because it's more common.

But note: if we guess SWORD and it's wrong, we still have more tries. But we are on the third guess.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests more letters? But we have three fixed, so it's efficient to guess the word.

I think SWORD is a good guess.

So, the third guess: SWORD
</think>
<thought>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, A, N, E are absent (x), and R is present but not in position 2 (-).  
- **Guess 2 (STORY)**: S is correct and in position 1 (✓), T is absent (x), O is correct and in position 3 (✓), R is correct and in position 4 (✓), Y is absent (x).  

Key deductions:  
1. The secret word has **S in position 1**, **O in position 3**, and **R in position 4**. The pattern is: `S _ O R _`.  
2. The absent letters are **C, A, N, E, T, Y** (cannot appear anywhere).  
3. The unknown positions are 2 and 5. Possible letters for these positions must avoid the absent letters and include common consonants/vowels like B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, W, etc.  
4. After evaluating possible words (e.g., SHORT, SCORE, SPORT, SHORE are invalid due to absent letters; SHIRK, SMOKY don't fit the O/R positions), the most common valid word fitting the pattern and constraints is **SWORD**:  
   - S (position 1, correct),  
   - W (position 2, untested letter),  
   - O (position 3, correct),  
   - R (position 4, correct),  
   - D (position 5, untested letter).  
   W and D are not excluded, making SWORD a strong candidate.  
5. If SWORD is incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down position 2 and 5 options (e.g., testing W and D).  

This guess efficiently targets the solution while adhering to all known constraints.
</thought>

<guess>SWORD</guess>",SWORD,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, A, N, E are absent (not in the word at all).
- R is present but not in position 2.

Guess 2: STORY -> Feedback: S(✓) T(x) O(✓) R(✓) Y(x)
Meaning:
- S is correct and in position 1 (since it's the first letter and marked ✓).
- T is absent (x) — so T is not in the word at all.
- O is correct and in position 3 (since it's the third letter and marked ✓).
- R is correct and in position 4 (since it's the fourth letter and marked ✓).
- Y is absent (x) — so Y is not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has S in position 1, O in position 3, and R in position 4.
- The word does not contain: C, A, N, E, T, Y.
- The remaining unknown positions are position 2 and position 5.

So the current pattern is: S _ O R _

We need to fill in the second and fifth positions with letters that are not in the excluded list (C, A, N, E, T, Y) and are likely to form a valid English word.

Possible letters for position 2 and 5: 
- We must avoid: C, A, N, E, T, Y.
- We can use other consonants and vowels. But note that we have already used S, O, R. The word must have exactly 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but we don't have information about duplicates yet.

However, from the feedback, we know that T and Y are absent, so they cannot be in the word.

We also know that the word has S, O, R, and two more letters (one in position 2 and one in position 5). Since R is already placed and we have no indication of duplicates, we assume no duplicates for now.

Common letters that are still available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

But we need to form a word that fits S _ O R _

Let's think of words that start with S, have O in the third position, R in the fourth, and then a fifth letter.

Some possibilities:
- S H O R ? -> SHORE, SHORN, SHORT, etc. But T is absent, so SHORT is invalid. SHORE has E which is absent. SHORN has N which is absent. So not SHOR?.
- S C O R ? -> SCORN, SCORE, but C is absent and N, E are absent. Invalid.
- S P O R ? -> SPORE (E absent), SPORT (T absent), so invalid.
- S L O R ? -> SLORM? (not a word), or SLOSH? (but O is in third, not second). 
- S K O R ? -> SKORT (but T is absent) and not common.
- S M O R ? -> SMORE (E absent), SMORG (not a word).
- S B O R ? -> SBORE (not a word), SBORN (not a word).
- S F O R ? -> SFORZ? (not 5 letters), not common.
- S W O R ? -> SWORD (D is a possibility, and D is not excluded). SWORD: S W O R D -> positions: S(1), W(2), O(3), R(4), D(5). 
  - Check against exclusions: W and D are not in the excluded list (C,A,N,E,T,Y). So SWORD is a candidate.

But wait, we have S(✓) from the second guess, meaning S is in position 1. In SWORD, S is in position 1, which matches. O is in position 3 (matches), R in position 4 (matches). So SWORD fits the pattern.

Are there other words?
- S H O R ? -> We already saw SHORE, SHORN, SHORT are invalid. What about SHORL? (a mineral, but not common). 
- S N O R ? -> but N is excluded.
- S G O R ? -> not a word.
- S D O R ? -> SDORR? not a word.

Another possibility: S O R with a letter in between? But the pattern is S _ O R _, so the second letter is between S and O, and then the fifth.

What about ""SOLAR""? But SOLAR has L in position 2 and A in position 5? But A is excluded. And also, O is in position 2? No, in SOLAR: S(1), O(2), L(3), A(4), R(5). But our pattern requires O in position 3 and R in position 4. So SOLAR doesn't fit.

Another: ""SORRY""? But SORRY: S(1), O(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5). But we have O in position 2? Our pattern requires O in position 3 and R in position 4. Also, Y is excluded. So invalid.

Another: ""SOFAR""? But O is in position 2, not 3. And A and F? A is excluded.

So, back to SWORD: it seems a strong candidate.

But let's check if there are others.

What about ""SCOUR""? But C is excluded, and O is in position 3? SCOUR: S(1), C(2), O(3), U(4), R(5). But we need R in position 4, not 5. And C is excluded. So no.

""SPURN"": P is allowed, but U and N? N is excluded. And R is in position 4? SPURN: S(1), P(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). But N is excluded. So invalid.

""SHIRK"": H, I, R, K. Pattern: S(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), K(5). But we need O in position 3, not I. So doesn't fit.

""SMOKY"": M, O, K, Y. But O is in position 3? SMOKY: S(1), M(2), O(3), K(4), Y(5). But Y is excluded, and we need R in position 4, not K. So no.

Therefore, the only common word that fits the pattern and avoids excluded letters is SWORD.

But wait, what about ""SHOWY""? But O is in position 3? SHOWY: S(1), H(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5). But we need R in position 4, not W. And Y is excluded. So no.

Another: ""SCOWL"": C and L, but C excluded, and O in position 3, but we need R in 4.

So, SWORD seems to be the only common word.

But let's confirm the pattern: S _ O R _ 
- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 2: unknown (must be a letter not excluded: so not C,A,N,E,T,Y)
- Position 3: O (fixed)
- Position 4: R (fixed)
- Position 5: unknown (same constraints)

SWORD: S (1), W (2), O (3), R (4), D (5). W and D are not excluded.

Are there any other words?
- ""SWORE"": but E is excluded.
- ""SWORN"": N is excluded.
- ""SWORD"" is the only one.

What about ""STORK""? But T is excluded.

Or ""SPORK""? P and K, but O is in position 3? SPORK: S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), K(5). That could work? But is SPORK a word? It's a portmanteau of spoon and fork, and it's accepted in some dictionaries. But let's check exclusions: P and K are not excluded (C,A,N,E,T,Y). So SPORK is a possibility.

But is it more common than SWORD? Probably not, but it's a valid guess.

However, we have two candidates: SWORD and SPORK.

But note: in the feedback from the second guess, we have T marked as absent. In SPORK, there is no T, so that's fine. Similarly, SWORD has no T.

But we need to choose one. Since we are trying to guess the word, and SWORD is a more common word, I'll go with SWORD.

But wait, what if the word is SPORK? We have to consider both.

However, in the context of the game, the secret word is likely a common word. SWORD is more common than SPORK.

Moreover, we have no reason to prefer SPORK over SWORD at this point.

But note: we have only one unknown position? Actually, two: positions 2 and 5.

In SWORD, we are guessing W and D.

In SPORK, we are guessing P and K.

We don't have any information about W, D, P, or K yet.

But we can only guess one word.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests more letters? But we already have three letters fixed (S, O, R) and only two unknown. So we can guess the word directly.

But to be safe, we might consider if there are other possibilities.

Another word: ""SHORL"" — but that's not common and has H and L. But we don't know about H and L. However, SHORL: S(1), H(2), O(3), R(4), L(5). H and L are not excluded. But is SHORL a valid word? It's a mineral, but very obscure. Probably not the secret word.

Similarly, ""SWOOP"": S(1), W(2), O(3), O(4), P(5). But we have two O's? And we need R in position 4, not O. So doesn't fit.

""SWOON"": S(1), W(2), O(3), O(4), N(5). Again, no R in position 4 and N is excluded.

So, between SWORD and SPORK, SWORD is more likely.

But let's see if there is a word with a vowel in position 2? For example, ""SOUR""? But that's 4 letters. ""SOURS"" — but that would be S(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), S(5). But we need O in position 3, not 2. So no.

""SAVOR"": but A is excluded.

Therefore, the most probable word is SWORD.

But note: we have feedback that in the first guess, R was present but not in position 2, and now we have R in position 4. Also, S in position 1 and O in position 3.

So, I think SWORD is the best guess.

But to be thorough, let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and avoid excluded letters:

- SWORD: W and D
- SPORK: P and K
- SHORL: H and L (but obscure)
- SMORG: not a word
- SWIRL: but I in position 3? SWIRL: S(1), W(2), I(3), R(4), L(5). But we need O in position 3, not I. So invalid.

Another: ""SABOR"" — but A is excluded.

""SEGOR"" — E excluded.

So, only two real candidates: SWORD and SPORK.

Given that, and since we have to guess, I'll choose SWORD because it's more common.

But note: if we guess SWORD and it's wrong, we still have more tries. But we are on the third guess.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests more letters? But we have three fixed, so it's efficient to guess the word.

I think SWORD is a good guess.

So, the third guess: SWORD<thought>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, A, N, E are absent (x), and R is present but not in position 2 (-).  
- **Guess 2 (STORY)**: S is correct and in position 1 (✓), T is absent (x), O is correct and in position 3 (✓), R is correct and in position 4 (✓), Y is absent (x).  

Key deductions:  
1. The secret word has **S in position 1**, **O in position 3**, and **R in position 4**. The pattern is: `S _ O R _`.  
2. The absent letters are **C, A, N, E, T, Y** (cannot appear anywhere).  
3. The unknown positions are 2 and 5. Possible letters for these positions must avoid the absent letters and include common consonants/vowels like B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, W, etc.  
4. After evaluating possible words (e.g., SHORT, SCORE, SPORT, SHORE are invalid due to absent letters; SHIRK, SMOKY don't fit the O/R positions), the most common valid word fitting the pattern and constraints is **SWORD**:  
   - S (position 1, correct),  
   - W (position 2, untested letter),  
   - O (position 3, correct),  
   - R (position 4, correct),  
   - D (position 5, untested letter).  
   W and D are not excluded, making SWORD a strong candidate.  
5. If SWORD is incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down position 2 and 5 options (e.g., testing W and D).  

This guess efficiently targets the solution while adhering to all known constraints.
