We are starting the game. We have no prior information. We need to pick a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have:
   - Common letters to maximize information.
   - Preferably no duplicate letters to cover more ground.

 Some common starting words in Wordle are: ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that uses common vowels and consonants to cover a broad set of letters.

 I am considering: ""CRATE""

 Why ""CRATE""?
   - It contains 'C', 'R', 'A', 'T', 'E'. These are common letters.
   - It includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 However, note that the word ""ROAST"" is also a good one because it has common letters and R and S are very common.

 Let me compare:
   - ""RAISE"" has R, A, I, S, E. It includes three vowels (A, I, E) which might be helpful.

 But since it's the first guess, we can choose any of these. 

 I'll go with ""RAISE"". It gives us three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This can help us quickly identify vowels in the word.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also popular.

 After consideration, I'll choose ""CRATE"" because it is frequently used and covers common letters.

 But note: The feedback we get will help us narrow down the next guess.

 Since the instructions don't specify any restriction, I'll use ""CRATE"".

 However, let me check: the example used BRISK. We don't want to bias too much.

 So my first guess: ""CRATE""

 We'll submit it and then get feedback for the next guess.
</think>
I'm starting the game without any prior clues. For an optimal first guess, I should choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the potential feedback. The word should include frequent vowels and consonants while avoiding duplicate letters to cover more ground. 

""CRATE"" is a strong choice because:
- Contains common letters: C, R, A, T, E
- Includes two vowels (A, E) and three consonants
- Covers frequent letters found in English 5-letter words

This guess will likely provide helpful feedback on letter presence and positioning for subsequent guesses.

We are given feedback for the first guess: CRATE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), T(x), E(-)
 This means:
   - A and E are in the secret word but not in the positions they were guessed (since they are marked as -).
   - C, R, T are not in the secret word at all (marked as x).

 Important: Since A and E are present but not in the guessed positions, we know:
   - The word contains A and E, but the A is not at position 3 (since in CRATE, A is the third letter) and E is not at position 5.

 Also, note that positions: 
   C (1st) -> absent
   R (2nd) -> absent
   A (3rd) -> present but wrong position
   T (4th) -> absent
   E (5th) -> present but wrong position

 Now, we have two confirmed letters: A and E.

 For the next guess, we need to:
   - Choose a 5-letter English word that includes A and E (since they are in the secret word).
   - Avoid using any of the absent letters: C, R, T (because they are not in the word at all). Also note that R was absent in the first guess, so R is not in the word? Wait, but the feedback for R was (x) meaning it is not in the word. Similarly for C and T.

 However, note: It's possible that a letter might appear more than once? But the rules don't specify. In Wordle, usually words can have repeated letters, but in this feedback, we must note:
   - The feedback symbol for each instance is independent. Since we only guessed one of each, and they were marked as absent, that means at least in those positions we don't have them. But if a letter is marked absent, it means that the total count of that letter in the secret word is less than the count we guessed? Actually, standard Wordle rules: if a letter is not in the word at all, it gets marked absent. If it is in the word but we have more copies than in the word, then the extra copies might be marked absent.

 Since we have only one instance of each in the guess, and they are marked absent, we can assume that the secret word does not contain C, R, or T.

 But wait: what about the letter R? We guessed R in position 2 and it was marked absent. Similarly, T in position 4 absent. So we know R and T are not in the word.

 Therefore, we must avoid letters C, R, T.

 Additionally, we know A and E are in the word, but not in positions 3 and 5.

 Now, let's think of a good next guess.

 We should look for words that:
   - Are 5 letters
   - Contain A and E
   - Exclude C, R, T
   - Also, we can try to use common letters to get more information.

 Since A and E are already confirmed, we can put them in different positions. Remember A cannot be at position 3 and E cannot be at position 5.

 We have three positions to fill: 1, 2, 4 (since position 3 must not be A and position 5 must not be E, but note: we might put A or E in one of the other positions? Actually, we can put A in 1,2,4 or 5? But we already know E cannot be at 5? However, we might put E in 1,2,3, or 4? Similarly, A in 1,2,4,5? But we don't know about position 1 and 2 and 4.

 We must also choose letters that are common and haven't been ruled out.

 Available letters: except C,R,T, and we know A and E are in the word.

 Let me think: we have 26 letters minus C,R,T -> 23 letters. But we might include other common letters.

 I am considering using a word with A and E and three new letters.

 A good strategy is to try to cover vowel possibilities and common consonants.

 Since we know A and E are present, we can focus on finding positions and including other common vowels/consonants.

 Common letters: S, L, N, O, I, D, H, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that includes A and E and three of these, avoiding C,R,T.

 Also, we must avoid placing A at position 3 and E at position 5.

 Some word ideas:

 - Option: ""LEMON"": but this has O and M? Wait, but it also has L,E,M,O,N -> but we are missing A? We must include A, because A is confirmed.

 So we need words that have A and E.

 Some words that contain A and E: ""LATHE"" -> but T is ruled out? No, T is absent so we cannot use T.

 Another: ""SLATE"" -> but has T, which is ruled out? And also R? No, SLATE has T? We cannot use T.

 Words without C,R,T and with A and E:

   ""AGILE"": contains A, G, I, L, E? -> Yes. But note positions:
      Position 1: A -> however, we don't know if A can be at position 1? Our feedback didn't rule that out.
      Position 5: E -> but in the first guess, E was at position 5 and we know it's not there? So putting E at position 5 would be bad? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? But we can put E elsewhere.

   In ""AGILE"":
      A at 1, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is the same as before? We know E is not at 5, so if we put E at 5, we are going to get a '-' because E is in the word but wrong position? Actually, we are not sure: the feedback for E at position 5 was '-', meaning that E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we guess E again at position 5, we would get '-' again (if the secret word doesn't have E at 5) or '✓' if by chance it is? But we already know it's not at 5, so putting E at position 5 again is wasteful.

   So ideally, we put E at a new position (either 1,2,3,4) and similarly A at a new position (not 3).

   For AGILE: 
        Position 1: A -> if we put A at 1, we might get:
            If the secret word has A at 1: ✓
            If not: then '-' meaning A is present but not at 1 (and also not at 3) so it would be in 2,4 or 5? But wait, if the secret word has A at 4, then we will get '-' for A at 1.
        Position 5: E -> this is the same position as before, and we know E is not at 5, so we will get '-' for E again? So that doesn't tell us anything new about E.

   So let's avoid putting E at position 5.

   We can choose a word that puts E at positions 1,2,3,4 and A at 1,2,4,5 (but not 3 and also we avoid the same position if we can get new information).

   Example words:

     - Place A at position 1: e.g., ""ABIDE"" -> includes A at 1 and E at 5? But we don't want E at 5. Also, E at 5 is the same as before? So no.

     - Place E at position 1: ""EARLY"" -> but has R? We cannot use R.

     - ""LEAST"": but has T? Cannot use T.

     - ""PASTE"": again, has S, T -> T is not allowed.

     - ""DATE"": only 4 letters? Must be 5.

     - Let me think: words without C,R,T and with A and E, and E not at 5.

     Some candidates:

        ""SNAKE"": 
            S, N, A, K, E -> includes S,N,A,K,E -> no R,T,C.
            Positions: 
               S:1, N:2, A:3 -> but wait, the first guess ruled out A at position 3? So if we put A at 3 again, we will get '-' (since A is present but not at position 3). But we already know that? So it doesn't give new information? Ideally, we want to put A in a new position to test.

        ""PLANE"":
            P,L,A,N,E -> no C,R,T.
            Positions: A at 3? Again, same as before.

        We cannot put A at position 3? So we need a word that has A not at position 3 and also E not at position 5.

        How about ""PLANE"" but rearrange? We can't rearrange arbitrarily, must be a valid word.

        Let me list:

          ""ADIEU"": has A and E, and vowels? But let's see:
             A:1, D:2, I:3, E:4, U:5 -> note E is at position 4, not 5? and A is at 1. 
          But does it avoid C,R,T? Yes.

          However, the first guess had A at 3 and E at 5. Now we have A at 1 and E at 4.

          This seems good: because we are testing A at a different position and E at a different position.

        Also, ""ADIEU"" is a common word used in Wordle as a starter? But we are not using it as starter. But okay.

        What other words?

        ""AISLE"": 
            A at 1, E at 5? But E at 5 we know is not correct? So that's inefficient.

        ""ABASE"":
            A at 1, B, A, S, E -> wait, duplicate A? Not necessarily bad, but we don't know if the secret word has two A's. However, we know A is present at least once. But our guess has two A's? So if the secret word has exactly one A, then one A might be marked ✓ or - and the other marked x? But that might give extra info? But let's avoid duplication for now?

        ""ADIEU"" seems efficient because:
          - It uses A and E (which we know are in the word)
          - It places A at position 1 (which we haven't tested) and E at position 4 (which we haven't tested)
          - And includes D, I, U which are new letters.

        Also, it avoids C,R,T.

        But note: in the feedback we got, A was marked as present but wrong position. What if the secret word has A at position 1? Then by guessing A at position 1, we'll get a ✓ for A? Similarly, if E is at position 4, we get ✓. Otherwise, we might get more '-' or even a ✓ if A is at 1 or E at 4.

        So let's choose ""ADIEU"".

        Another option: ""MEDIA"": 
            M,E,D,I,A -> positions: E at 2, A at 5 -> but A at 5: we haven't tested A at 5? And E at 2? That's good. Also, avoids C,R,T.

        But ""ADIEU"" and ""MEDIA"" are both valid. 

        How about ""ANIME"": 
            A at 1, N, I, M, E -> E at 5? again.

        So ""MEDIA"" puts E at 2 and A at 5? But note: in the first guess, we had E at 5? And we know E is not at position 5? So putting A at 5 and E at 2? That seems okay.

        However, we know E is present but not at position 5. If we put E at 2 and get a '-', that tells us E is in the word but not at 2? Then we know it must be at 1,3 or 4? Similarly, for A we know it is not at 3. So if we put A at 5, and we get '-', that tells us A is not at 5? Then A must be at 1,2, or 4? But we don't have a test for A at 1? We did test A at 3 and now at 5? So not covering position 1 or 2.

        Alternatively, with ""ADIEU"": 
          Positions for A: 1 -> test position 1
          Positions for E: 4 -> test position 4

        So if we get:
          A at 1: ✓ or '-'? 
          E at 4: ✓ or '-'?

        That would be more informative because we are testing two new positions.

        Also, in ""MEDIA"", E at 2 and A at 5? We test E at 2 and A at 5? But we already know E cannot be at 5? And we don't have a test for A at 1? So ""ADIEU"" seems better.

        However, note: what if the secret word has A and E? And we are testing A at 1 and E at 4? That might get us two ✓ if they are correctly placed? Otherwise, if not, we get information.

        I'll go with ""ADIEU"".

        So the second guess: ADIEU

        But note: ""ADIEU"" is a valid English word? Yes, it means goodbye.

        Also, it has the following letters: A, D, I, E, U. None of the absent letters.

        So let's use that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"", I analyzed the following:
- C, R, and T are **NOT** in the secret word (marked ✗).
- A and E are in the word but NOT in positions 3 and 5 respectively (marked -).
- Therefore, the secret word contains A and E but excludes C, R, T.

For the second guess, I prioritized:
1. **Including A and E** while avoiding C, R, T.
2. **Testing new positions**: A should not be in position 3 (already tested), and E should not be in position 5 (already tested). I chose positions that maximize new information: A in position 1 and E in position 4.
3. **Covering new common letters**: S, L, N, P, D, I, etc., to gather more clues.
4. **Avoiding reused positions** for known letters to learn about their correct placements.

""ADIEU"" is a strong choice because:
- Contains A (position 1) and E (position 4), both in new untested positions.
- Avoids C, R, T; introduces new letters: D, I, U.
- Tests vowel-heavy combinations efficiently, helping narrow down possibilities.

<guess>ADIEU</guess>",ADIEU,"We are given feedback for the first guess: CRATE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), T(x), E(-)
 This means:
   - A and E are in the secret word but not in the positions they were guessed (since they are marked as -).
   - C, R, T are not in the secret word at all (marked as x).

 Important: Since A and E are present but not in the guessed positions, we know:
   - The word contains A and E, but the A is not at position 3 (since in CRATE, A is the third letter) and E is not at position 5.

 Also, note that positions: 
   C (1st) -> absent
   R (2nd) -> absent
   A (3rd) -> present but wrong position
   T (4th) -> absent
   E (5th) -> present but wrong position

 Now, we have two confirmed letters: A and E.

 For the next guess, we need to:
   - Choose a 5-letter English word that includes A and E (since they are in the secret word).
   - Avoid using any of the absent letters: C, R, T (because they are not in the word at all). Also note that R was absent in the first guess, so R is not in the word? Wait, but the feedback for R was (x) meaning it is not in the word. Similarly for C and T.

 However, note: It's possible that a letter might appear more than once? But the rules don't specify. In Wordle, usually words can have repeated letters, but in this feedback, we must note:
   - The feedback symbol for each instance is independent. Since we only guessed one of each, and they were marked as absent, that means at least in those positions we don't have them. But if a letter is marked absent, it means that the total count of that letter in the secret word is less than the count we guessed? Actually, standard Wordle rules: if a letter is not in the word at all, it gets marked absent. If it is in the word but we have more copies than in the word, then the extra copies might be marked absent.

 Since we have only one instance of each in the guess, and they are marked absent, we can assume that the secret word does not contain C, R, or T.

 But wait: what about the letter R? We guessed R in position 2 and it was marked absent. Similarly, T in position 4 absent. So we know R and T are not in the word.

 Therefore, we must avoid letters C, R, T.

 Additionally, we know A and E are in the word, but not in positions 3 and 5.

 Now, let's think of a good next guess.

 We should look for words that:
   - Are 5 letters
   - Contain A and E
   - Exclude C, R, T
   - Also, we can try to use common letters to get more information.

 Since A and E are already confirmed, we can put them in different positions. Remember A cannot be at position 3 and E cannot be at position 5.

 We have three positions to fill: 1, 2, 4 (since position 3 must not be A and position 5 must not be E, but note: we might put A or E in one of the other positions? Actually, we can put A in 1,2,4 or 5? But we already know E cannot be at 5? However, we might put E in 1,2,3, or 4? Similarly, A in 1,2,4,5? But we don't know about position 1 and 2 and 4.

 We must also choose letters that are common and haven't been ruled out.

 Available letters: except C,R,T, and we know A and E are in the word.

 Let me think: we have 26 letters minus C,R,T -> 23 letters. But we might include other common letters.

 I am considering using a word with A and E and three new letters.

 A good strategy is to try to cover vowel possibilities and common consonants.

 Since we know A and E are present, we can focus on finding positions and including other common vowels/consonants.

 Common letters: S, L, N, O, I, D, H, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that includes A and E and three of these, avoiding C,R,T.

 Also, we must avoid placing A at position 3 and E at position 5.

 Some word ideas:

 - Option: ""LEMON"": but this has O and M? Wait, but it also has L,E,M,O,N -> but we are missing A? We must include A, because A is confirmed.

 So we need words that have A and E.

 Some words that contain A and E: ""LATHE"" -> but T is ruled out? No, T is absent so we cannot use T.

 Another: ""SLATE"" -> but has T, which is ruled out? And also R? No, SLATE has T? We cannot use T.

 Words without C,R,T and with A and E:

   ""AGILE"": contains A, G, I, L, E? -> Yes. But note positions:
      Position 1: A -> however, we don't know if A can be at position 1? Our feedback didn't rule that out.
      Position 5: E -> but in the first guess, E was at position 5 and we know it's not there? So putting E at position 5 would be bad? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? But we can put E elsewhere.

   In ""AGILE"":
      A at 1, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is the same as before? We know E is not at 5, so if we put E at 5, we are going to get a '-' because E is in the word but wrong position? Actually, we are not sure: the feedback for E at position 5 was '-', meaning that E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we guess E again at position 5, we would get '-' again (if the secret word doesn't have E at 5) or '✓' if by chance it is? But we already know it's not at 5, so putting E at position 5 again is wasteful.

   So ideally, we put E at a new position (either 1,2,3,4) and similarly A at a new position (not 3).

   For AGILE: 
        Position 1: A -> if we put A at 1, we might get:
            If the secret word has A at 1: ✓
            If not: then '-' meaning A is present but not at 1 (and also not at 3) so it would be in 2,4 or 5? But wait, if the secret word has A at 4, then we will get '-' for A at 1.
        Position 5: E -> this is the same position as before, and we know E is not at 5, so we will get '-' for E again? So that doesn't tell us anything new about E.

   So let's avoid putting E at position 5.

   We can choose a word that puts E at positions 1,2,3,4 and A at 1,2,4,5 (but not 3 and also we avoid the same position if we can get new information).

   Example words:

     - Place A at position 1: e.g., ""ABIDE"" -> includes A at 1 and E at 5? But we don't want E at 5. Also, E at 5 is the same as before? So no.

     - Place E at position 1: ""EARLY"" -> but has R? We cannot use R.

     - ""LEAST"": but has T? Cannot use T.

     - ""PASTE"": again, has S, T -> T is not allowed.

     - ""DATE"": only 4 letters? Must be 5.

     - Let me think: words without C,R,T and with A and E, and E not at 5.

     Some candidates:

        ""SNAKE"": 
            S, N, A, K, E -> includes S,N,A,K,E -> no R,T,C.
            Positions: 
               S:1, N:2, A:3 -> but wait, the first guess ruled out A at position 3? So if we put A at 3 again, we will get '-' (since A is present but not at position 3). But we already know that? So it doesn't give new information? Ideally, we want to put A in a new position to test.

        ""PLANE"":
            P,L,A,N,E -> no C,R,T.
            Positions: A at 3? Again, same as before.

        We cannot put A at position 3? So we need a word that has A not at position 3 and also E not at position 5.

        How about ""PLANE"" but rearrange? We can't rearrange arbitrarily, must be a valid word.

        Let me list:

          ""ADIEU"": has A and E, and vowels? But let's see:
             A:1, D:2, I:3, E:4, U:5 -> note E is at position 4, not 5? and A is at 1. 
          But does it avoid C,R,T? Yes.

          However, the first guess had A at 3 and E at 5. Now we have A at 1 and E at 4.

          This seems good: because we are testing A at a different position and E at a different position.

        Also, ""ADIEU"" is a common word used in Wordle as a starter? But we are not using it as starter. But okay.

        What other words?

        ""AISLE"": 
            A at 1, E at 5? But E at 5 we know is not correct? So that's inefficient.

        ""ABASE"":
            A at 1, B, A, S, E -> wait, duplicate A? Not necessarily bad, but we don't know if the secret word has two A's. However, we know A is present at least once. But our guess has two A's? So if the secret word has exactly one A, then one A might be marked ✓ or - and the other marked x? But that might give extra info? But let's avoid duplication for now?

        ""ADIEU"" seems efficient because:
          - It uses A and E (which we know are in the word)
          - It places A at position 1 (which we haven't tested) and E at position 4 (which we haven't tested)
          - And includes D, I, U which are new letters.

        Also, it avoids C,R,T.

        But note: in the feedback we got, A was marked as present but wrong position. What if the secret word has A at position 1? Then by guessing A at position 1, we'll get a ✓ for A? Similarly, if E is at position 4, we get ✓. Otherwise, we might get more '-' or even a ✓ if A is at 1 or E at 4.

        So let's choose ""ADIEU"".

        Another option: ""MEDIA"": 
            M,E,D,I,A -> positions: E at 2, A at 5 -> but A at 5: we haven't tested A at 5? And E at 2? That's good. Also, avoids C,R,T.

        But ""ADIEU"" and ""MEDIA"" are both valid. 

        How about ""ANIME"": 
            A at 1, N, I, M, E -> E at 5? again.

        So ""MEDIA"" puts E at 2 and A at 5? But note: in the first guess, we had E at 5? And we know E is not at position 5? So putting A at 5 and E at 2? That seems okay.

        However, we know E is present but not at position 5. If we put E at 2 and get a '-', that tells us E is in the word but not at 2? Then we know it must be at 1,3 or 4? Similarly, for A we know it is not at 3. So if we put A at 5, and we get '-', that tells us A is not at 5? Then A must be at 1,2, or 4? But we don't have a test for A at 1? We did test A at 3 and now at 5? So not covering position 1 or 2.

        Alternatively, with ""ADIEU"": 
          Positions for A: 1 -> test position 1
          Positions for E: 4 -> test position 4

        So if we get:
          A at 1: ✓ or '-'? 
          E at 4: ✓ or '-'?

        That would be more informative because we are testing two new positions.

        Also, in ""MEDIA"", E at 2 and A at 5? We test E at 2 and A at 5? But we already know E cannot be at 5? And we don't have a test for A at 1? So ""ADIEU"" seems better.

        However, note: what if the secret word has A and E? And we are testing A at 1 and E at 4? That might get us two ✓ if they are correctly placed? Otherwise, if not, we get information.

        I'll go with ""ADIEU"".

        So the second guess: ADIEU

        But note: ""ADIEU"" is a valid English word? Yes, it means goodbye.

        Also, it has the following letters: A, D, I, E, U. None of the absent letters.

        So let's use that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"", I analyzed the following:
- C, R, and T are **NOT** in the secret word (marked ✗).
- A and E are in the word but NOT in positions 3 and 5 respectively (marked -).
- Therefore, the secret word contains A and E but excludes C, R, T.

For the second guess, I prioritized:
1. **Including A and E** while avoiding C, R, T.
2. **Testing new positions**: A should not be in position 3 (already tested), and E should not be in position 5 (already tested). I chose positions that maximize new information: A in position 1 and E in position 4.
3. **Covering new common letters**: S, L, N, P, D, I, etc., to gather more clues.
4. **Avoiding reused positions** for known letters to learn about their correct placements.

""ADIEU"" is a strong choice because:
- Contains A (position 1) and E (position 4), both in new untested positions.
- Avoids C, R, T; introduces new letters: D, I, U.
- Tests vowel-heavy combinations efficiently, helping narrow down possibilities.",Guess 2: ADIEU -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) I(x) E(✓) U(x),FAIL

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior information. We need to pick a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have:
   - Common letters to maximize information.
   - Preferably no duplicate letters to cover more ground.

 Some common starting words in Wordle are: ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that uses common vowels and consonants to cover a broad set of letters.

 I am considering: ""CRATE""

 Why ""CRATE""?
   - It contains 'C', 'R', 'A', 'T', 'E'. These are common letters.
   - It includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 However, note that the word ""ROAST"" is also a good one because it has common letters and R and S are very common.

 Let me compare:
   - ""RAISE"" has R, A, I, S, E. It includes three vowels (A, I, E) which might be helpful.

 But since it's the first guess, we can choose any of these. 

 I'll go with ""RAISE"". It gives us three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This can help us quickly identify vowels in the word.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also popular.

 After consideration, I'll choose ""CRATE"" because it is frequently used and covers common letters.

 But note: The feedback we get will help us narrow down the next guess.

 Since the instructions don't specify any restriction, I'll use ""CRATE"".

 However, let me check: the example used BRISK. We don't want to bias too much.

 So my first guess: ""CRATE""

 We'll submit it and then get feedback for the next guess.I'm starting the game without any prior clues. For an optimal first guess, I should choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the potential feedback. The word should include frequent vowels and consonants while avoiding duplicate letters to cover more ground. 

""CRATE"" is a strong choice because:
- Contains common letters: C, R, A, T, E
- Includes two vowels (A, E) and three consonants
- Covers frequent letters found in English 5-letter words

This guess will likely provide helpful feedback on letter presence and positioning for subsequent guesses.

<guess>CRATE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess: CRATE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), T(x), E(-)
 This means:
   - A and E are in the secret word but not in the positions they were guessed (since they are marked as -).
   - C, R, T are not in the secret word at all (marked as x).

 Important: Since A and E are present but not in the guessed positions, we know:
   - The word contains A and E, but the A is not at position 3 (since in CRATE, A is the third letter) and E is not at position 5.

 Also, note that positions: 
   C (1st) -> absent
   R (2nd) -> absent
   A (3rd) -> present but wrong position
   T (4th) -> absent
   E (5th) -> present but wrong position

 Now, we have two confirmed letters: A and E.

 For the next guess, we need to:
   - Choose a 5-letter English word that includes A and E (since they are in the secret word).
   - Avoid using any of the absent letters: C, R, T (because they are not in the word at all). Also note that R was absent in the first guess, so R is not in the word? Wait, but the feedback for R was (x) meaning it is not in the word. Similarly for C and T.

 However, note: It's possible that a letter might appear more than once? But the rules don't specify. In Wordle, usually words can have repeated letters, but in this feedback, we must note:
   - The feedback symbol for each instance is independent. Since we only guessed one of each, and they were marked as absent, that means at least in those positions we don't have them. But if a letter is marked absent, it means that the total count of that letter in the secret word is less than the count we guessed? Actually, standard Wordle rules: if a letter is not in the word at all, it gets marked absent. If it is in the word but we have more copies than in the word, then the extra copies might be marked absent.

 Since we have only one instance of each in the guess, and they are marked absent, we can assume that the secret word does not contain C, R, or T.

 But wait: what about the letter R? We guessed R in position 2 and it was marked absent. Similarly, T in position 4 absent. So we know R and T are not in the word.

 Therefore, we must avoid letters C, R, T.

 Additionally, we know A and E are in the word, but not in positions 3 and 5.

 Now, let's think of a good next guess.

 We should look for words that:
   - Are 5 letters
   - Contain A and E
   - Exclude C, R, T
   - Also, we can try to use common letters to get more information.

 Since A and E are already confirmed, we can put them in different positions. Remember A cannot be at position 3 and E cannot be at position 5.

 We have three positions to fill: 1, 2, 4 (since position 3 must not be A and position 5 must not be E, but note: we might put A or E in one of the other positions? Actually, we can put A in 1,2,4 or 5? But we already know E cannot be at 5? However, we might put E in 1,2,3, or 4? Similarly, A in 1,2,4,5? But we don't know about position 1 and 2 and 4.

 We must also choose letters that are common and haven't been ruled out.

 Available letters: except C,R,T, and we know A and E are in the word.

 Let me think: we have 26 letters minus C,R,T -> 23 letters. But we might include other common letters.

 I am considering using a word with A and E and three new letters.

 A good strategy is to try to cover vowel possibilities and common consonants.

 Since we know A and E are present, we can focus on finding positions and including other common vowels/consonants.

 Common letters: S, L, N, O, I, D, H, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that includes A and E and three of these, avoiding C,R,T.

 Also, we must avoid placing A at position 3 and E at position 5.

 Some word ideas:

 - Option: ""LEMON"": but this has O and M? Wait, but it also has L,E,M,O,N -> but we are missing A? We must include A, because A is confirmed.

 So we need words that have A and E.

 Some words that contain A and E: ""LATHE"" -> but T is ruled out? No, T is absent so we cannot use T.

 Another: ""SLATE"" -> but has T, which is ruled out? And also R? No, SLATE has T? We cannot use T.

 Words without C,R,T and with A and E:

   ""AGILE"": contains A, G, I, L, E? -> Yes. But note positions:
      Position 1: A -> however, we don't know if A can be at position 1? Our feedback didn't rule that out.
      Position 5: E -> but in the first guess, E was at position 5 and we know it's not there? So putting E at position 5 would be bad? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? But we can put E elsewhere.

   In ""AGILE"":
      A at 1, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is the same as before? We know E is not at 5, so if we put E at 5, we are going to get a '-' because E is in the word but wrong position? Actually, we are not sure: the feedback for E at position 5 was '-', meaning that E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we guess E again at position 5, we would get '-' again (if the secret word doesn't have E at 5) or '✓' if by chance it is? But we already know it's not at 5, so putting E at position 5 again is wasteful.

   So ideally, we put E at a new position (either 1,2,3,4) and similarly A at a new position (not 3).

   For AGILE: 
        Position 1: A -> if we put A at 1, we might get:
            If the secret word has A at 1: ✓
            If not: then '-' meaning A is present but not at 1 (and also not at 3) so it would be in 2,4 or 5? But wait, if the secret word has A at 4, then we will get '-' for A at 1.
        Position 5: E -> this is the same position as before, and we know E is not at 5, so we will get '-' for E again? So that doesn't tell us anything new about E.

   So let's avoid putting E at position 5.

   We can choose a word that puts E at positions 1,2,3,4 and A at 1,2,4,5 (but not 3 and also we avoid the same position if we can get new information).

   Example words:

     - Place A at position 1: e.g., ""ABIDE"" -> includes A at 1 and E at 5? But we don't want E at 5. Also, E at 5 is the same as before? So no.

     - Place E at position 1: ""EARLY"" -> but has R? We cannot use R.

     - ""LEAST"": but has T? Cannot use T.

     - ""PASTE"": again, has S, T -> T is not allowed.

     - ""DATE"": only 4 letters? Must be 5.

     - Let me think: words without C,R,T and with A and E, and E not at 5.

     Some candidates:

        ""SNAKE"": 
            S, N, A, K, E -> includes S,N,A,K,E -> no R,T,C.
            Positions: 
               S:1, N:2, A:3 -> but wait, the first guess ruled out A at position 3? So if we put A at 3 again, we will get '-' (since A is present but not at position 3). But we already know that? So it doesn't give new information? Ideally, we want to put A in a new position to test.

        ""PLANE"":
            P,L,A,N,E -> no C,R,T.
            Positions: A at 3? Again, same as before.

        We cannot put A at position 3? So we need a word that has A not at position 3 and also E not at position 5.

        How about ""PLANE"" but rearrange? We can't rearrange arbitrarily, must be a valid word.

        Let me list:

          ""ADIEU"": has A and E, and vowels? But let's see:
             A:1, D:2, I:3, E:4, U:5 -> note E is at position 4, not 5? and A is at 1. 
          But does it avoid C,R,T? Yes.

          However, the first guess had A at 3 and E at 5. Now we have A at 1 and E at 4.

          This seems good: because we are testing A at a different position and E at a different position.

        Also, ""ADIEU"" is a common word used in Wordle as a starter? But we are not using it as starter. But okay.

        What other words?

        ""AISLE"": 
            A at 1, E at 5? But E at 5 we know is not correct? So that's inefficient.

        ""ABASE"":
            A at 1, B, A, S, E -> wait, duplicate A? Not necessarily bad, but we don't know if the secret word has two A's. However, we know A is present at least once. But our guess has two A's? So if the secret word has exactly one A, then one A might be marked ✓ or - and the other marked x? But that might give extra info? But let's avoid duplication for now?

        ""ADIEU"" seems efficient because:
          - It uses A and E (which we know are in the word)
          - It places A at position 1 (which we haven't tested) and E at position 4 (which we haven't tested)
          - And includes D, I, U which are new letters.

        Also, it avoids C,R,T.

        But note: in the feedback we got, A was marked as present but wrong position. What if the secret word has A at position 1? Then by guessing A at position 1, we'll get a ✓ for A? Similarly, if E is at position 4, we get ✓. Otherwise, we might get more '-' or even a ✓ if A is at 1 or E at 4.

        So let's choose ""ADIEU"".

        Another option: ""MEDIA"": 
            M,E,D,I,A -> positions: E at 2, A at 5 -> but A at 5: we haven't tested A at 5? And E at 2? That's good. Also, avoids C,R,T.

        But ""ADIEU"" and ""MEDIA"" are both valid. 

        How about ""ANIME"": 
            A at 1, N, I, M, E -> E at 5? again.

        So ""MEDIA"" puts E at 2 and A at 5? But note: in the first guess, we had E at 5? And we know E is not at position 5? So putting A at 5 and E at 2? That seems okay.

        However, we know E is present but not at position 5. If we put E at 2 and get a '-', that tells us E is in the word but not at 2? Then we know it must be at 1,3 or 4? Similarly, for A we know it is not at 3. So if we put A at 5, and we get '-', that tells us A is not at 5? Then A must be at 1,2, or 4? But we don't have a test for A at 1? We did test A at 3 and now at 5? So not covering position 1 or 2.

        Alternatively, with ""ADIEU"": 
          Positions for A: 1 -> test position 1
          Positions for E: 4 -> test position 4

        So if we get:
          A at 1: ✓ or '-'? 
          E at 4: ✓ or '-'?

        That would be more informative because we are testing two new positions.

        Also, in ""MEDIA"", E at 2 and A at 5? We test E at 2 and A at 5? But we already know E cannot be at 5? And we don't have a test for A at 1? So ""ADIEU"" seems better.

        However, note: what if the secret word has A and E? And we are testing A at 1 and E at 4? That might get us two ✓ if they are correctly placed? Otherwise, if not, we get information.

        I'll go with ""ADIEU"".

        So the second guess: ADIEU

        But note: ""ADIEU"" is a valid English word? Yes, it means goodbye.

        Also, it has the following letters: A, D, I, E, U. None of the absent letters.

        So let's use that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"", I analyzed the following:
- C, R, and T are **NOT** in the secret word (marked ✗).
- A and E are in the word but NOT in positions 3 and 5 respectively (marked -).
- Therefore, the secret word contains A and E but excludes C, R, T.

For the second guess, I prioritized:
1. **Including A and E** while avoiding C, R, T.
2. **Testing new positions**: A should not be in position 3 (already tested), and E should not be in position 5 (already tested). I chose positions that maximize new information: A in position 1 and E in position 4.
3. **Covering new common letters**: S, L, N, P, D, I, etc., to gather more clues.
4. **Avoiding reused positions** for known letters to learn about their correct placements.

""ADIEU"" is a strong choice because:
- Contains A (position 1) and E (position 4), both in new untested positions.
- Avoids C, R, T; introduces new letters: D, I, U.
- Tests vowel-heavy combinations efficiently, helping narrow down possibilities.

Also note that R was absent in the first guess, so R is not in the word? Wait, but the feedback for R was (x) meaning it is not in the word. Similarly for C and T.\n\n However, note: It\'s possible that a letter might appear more than once? But the rules don\'t specify. In Wordle, usually words can have repeated letters, but in this feedback, we must note:\n   - The feedback symbol for each instance is independent. Since we only guessed one of each, and they were marked as absent, that means at least in those positions we don\'t have them. But if a letter is marked absent, it means that the total count of that letter in the secret word is less than the count we guessed? Actually, standard Wordle rules: if a letter is not in the word at all, it gets marked absent. If it is in the word but we have more copies than in the word, then the extra copies might be marked absent.\n\n Since we have only one instance of each in the guess, and they are marked absent, we can assume that the secret word does not contain C, R, or T.\n\n But wait: what about the letter R? We guessed R in position 2 and it was marked absent. Similarly, T in position 4 absent. So we know R and T are not in the word.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid letters C, R, T.\n\n Additionally, we know A and E are in the word, but not in positions 3 and 5.\n\n Now, let\'s think of a good next guess.\n\n We should look for words that:\n   - Are 5 letters\n   - Contain A and E\n   - Exclude C, R, T\n   - Also, we can try to use common letters to get more information.\n\n Since A and E are already confirmed, we can put them in different positions. Remember A cannot be at position 3 and E cannot be at position 5.\n\n We have three positions to fill: 1, 2, 4 (since position 3 must not be A and position 5 must not be E, but note: we might put A or E in one of the other positions? Actually, we can put A in 1,2,4 or 5? But we already know E cannot be at 5? However, we might put E in 1,2,3, or 4? Similarly, A in 1,2,4,5? But we don\'t know about position 1 and 2 and 4.\n\n We must also choose letters that are common and haven\'t been ruled out.\n\n Available letters: except C,R,T, and we know A and E are in the word.\n\n Let me think: we have 26 letters minus C,R,T -> 23 letters. But we might include other common letters.\n\n I am considering using a word with A and E and three new letters.\n\n A good strategy is to try to cover vowel possibilities and common consonants.\n\n Since we know A and E are present, we can focus on finding positions and including other common vowels/consonants.\n\n Common letters: S, L, N, O, I, D, H, etc.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that includes A and E and three of these, avoiding C,R,T.\n\n Also, we must avoid placing A at position 3 and E at position 5.\n\n Some word ideas:\n\n - Option: ""LEMON"": but this has O and M? Wait, but it also has L,E,M,O,N -> but we are missing A? We must include A, because A is confirmed.\n\n So we need words that have A and E.\n\n Some words that contain A and E: ""LATHE"" -> but T is ruled out? No, T is absent so we cannot use T.\n\n Another: ""SLATE"" -> but has T, which is ruled out? And also R? No, SLATE has T? We cannot use T.\n\n Words without C,R,T and with A and E:\n\n   ""AGILE"": contains A, G, I, L, E? -> Yes. But note positions:\n      Position 1: A -> however, we don\'t know if A can be at position 1? Our feedback didn\'t rule that out.\n      Position 5: E -> but in the first guess, E was at position 5 and we know it\'s not there? So putting E at position 5 would be bad? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? But we can put E elsewhere.\n\n   In ""AGILE"":\n      A at 1, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is the same as before? We know E is not at 5, so if we put E at 5, we are going to get a \'-\' because E is in the word but wrong position? Actually, we are not sure: the feedback for E at position 5 was \'-\', meaning that E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we guess E again at position 5, we would get \'-\' again (if the secret word doesn\'t have E at 5) or \'✓\' if by chance it is? But we already know it\'s not at 5, so putting E at position 5 again is wasteful.\n\n   So ideally, we put E at a new position (either 1,2,3,4) and similarly A at a new position (not 3).\n\n   For AGILE: \n        Position 1: A -> if we put A at 1, we might get:\n            If the secret word has A at 1: ✓\n            If not: then \'-\' meaning A is present but not at 1 (and also not at 3) so it would be in 2,4 or 5? But wait, if the secret word has A at 4, then we will get \'-\' for A at 1.\n        Position 5: E -> this is the same position as before, and we know E is not at 5, so we will get \'-\' for E again? So that doesn\'t tell us anything new about E.\n\n   So let\'s avoid putting E at position 5.\n\n   We can choose a word that puts E at positions 1,2,3,4 and A at 1,2,4,5 (but not 3 and also we avoid the same position if we can get new information).\n\n   Example words:\n\n     - Place A at position 1: e.g., ""ABIDE"" -> includes A at 1 and E at 5? But we don\'t want E at 5. Also, E at 5 is the same as before? So no.\n\n     - Place E at position 1: ""EARLY"" -> but has R? We cannot use R.\n\n     - ""LEAST"": but has T? Cannot use T.\n\n     - ""PASTE"": again, has S, T -> T is not allowed.\n\n     - ""DATE"": only 4 letters? Must be 5.\n\n     - Let me think: words without C,R,T and with A and E, and E not at 5.\n\n     Some candidates:\n\n        ""SNAKE"": \n            S, N, A, K, E -> includes S,N,A,K,E -> no R,T,C.\n            Positions: \n               S:1, N:2, A:3 -> but wait, the first guess ruled out A at position 3? So if we put A at 3 again, we will get \'-\' (since A is present but not at position 3). But we already know that? So it doesn\'t give new information? Ideally, we want to put A in a new position to test.\n\n        ""PLANE"":\n            P,L,A,N,E -> no C,R,T.\n            Positions: A at 3? Again, same as before.\n\n        We cannot put A at position 3? So we need a word that has A not at position 3 and also E not at position 5.\n\n        How about ""PLANE"" but rearrange? We can\'t rearrange arbitrarily, must be a valid word.\n\n        Let me list:\n\n          ""ADIEU"": has A and E, and vowels? But let\'s see:\n             A:1, D:2, I:3, E:4, U:5 -> note E is at position 4, not 5? and A is at 1. \n          But does it avoid C,R,T? Yes.\n\n          However, the first guess had A at 3 and E at 5. Now we have A at 1 and E at 4.\n\n          This seems good: because we are testing A at a different position and E at a different position.\n\n        Also, ""ADIEU"" is a common word used in Wordle as a starter? But we are not using it as starter. But okay.\n\n        What other words?\n\n        ""AISLE"": \n            A at 1, E at 5? But E at 5 we know is not correct? So that\'s inefficient.\n\n        ""ABASE"":\n            A at 1, B, A, S, E -> wait, duplicate A? Not necessarily bad, but we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s. However, we know A is present at least once. But our guess has two A\'s? So if the secret word has exactly one A, then one A might be marked ✓ or - and the other marked x? But that might give extra info? But let\'s avoid duplication for now?\n\n        ""ADIEU"" seems efficient because:\n          - It uses A and E (which we know are in the word)\n          - It places A at position 1 (which we haven\'t tested) and E at position 4 (which we haven\'t tested)\n          - And includes D, I, U which are new letters.\n\n        Also, it avoids C,R,T.\n\n        But note: in the feedback we got, A was marked as present but wrong position. What if the secret word has A at position 1? Then by guessing A at position 1, we\'ll get a ✓ for A? Similarly, if E is at position 4, we get ✓. Otherwise, we might get more \'-\' or even a ✓ if A is at 1 or E at 4.\n\n        So let\'s choose ""ADIEU"".\n\n        Another option: ""MEDIA"": \n            M,E,D,I,A -> positions: E at 2, A at 5 -> but A at 5: we haven\'t tested A at 5? And E at 2? That\'s good. Also, avoids C,R,T.\n\n        But ""ADIEU"" and ""MEDIA"" are both valid. \n\n        How about ""ANIME"": \n            A at 1, N, I, M, E -> E at 5? again.\n\n        So ""MEDIA"" puts E at 2 and A at 5? But note: in the first guess, we had E at 5? And we know E is not at position 5? So putting A at 5 and E at 2? That seems okay.\n\n        However, we know E is present but not at position 5. If we put E at 2 and get a \'-\', that tells us E is in the word but not at 2? Then we know it must be at 1,3 or 4? Similarly, for A we know it is not at 3. So if we put A at 5, and we get \'-\', that tells us A is not at 5? Then A must be at 1,2, or 4? But we don\'t have a test for A at 1? We did test A at 3 and now at 5? So not covering position 1 or 2.\n\n        Alternatively, with ""ADIEU"": \n          Positions for A: 1 -> test position 1\n          Positions for E: 4 -> test position 4\n\n        So if we get:\n          A at 1: ✓ or \'-\'? \n          E at 4: ✓ or \'-\'?\n\n        That would be more informative because we are testing two new positions.\n\n        Also, in ""MEDIA"", E at 2 and A at 5? We test E at 2 and A at 5? But we already know E cannot be at 5? And we don\'t have a test for A at 1? So ""ADIEU"" seems better.\n\n        However, note: what if the secret word has A and E? And we are testing A at 1 and E at 4? That might get us two ✓ if they are correctly placed? Otherwise, if not, we get information.\n\n        I\'ll go with ""ADIEU"".\n\n        So the second guess: ADIEU\n\n        But note: ""ADIEU"" is a valid English word? Yes, it means goodbye.\n\n        Also, it has the following letters: A, D, I, E, U. None of the absent letters.\n\n        So let\'s use that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"", I analyzed the following:\n- C, R, and T are **NOT** in the secret word (marked ✗).\n- A and E are in the word but NOT in positions 3 and 5 respectively (marked -).\n- Therefore, the secret word contains A and E but excludes C, R, T.\n\nFor the second guess, I prioritized:\n1. **Including A and E** while avoiding C, R, T.\n2. **Testing new positions**: A should not be in position 3 (already tested), and E should not be in position 5 (already tested).

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRATE
  C: x (absent)
  R: x (absent)
  A: - (present, but wrong position; not position 3)
  T: x (absent)
  E: - (present, but wrong position; not position 5)

Guess 2: ADIEU
  A: ✓ (correct position, so A is at position 1)
  D: x (absent)
  I: x (absent)
  E: ✓ (correct position, so E is at position 4)
  U: x (absent)

Now, we know:
- The secret word has A at position 1 and E at position 4.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, T, D, I, U.
- We have two known letters: A (pos1) and E (pos4).

The word structure is: A _ _ E _

We need to fill the middle three positions (positions 2, 3, and 5) with letters that are not in the excluded list (C, R, T, D, I, U) and are English letters.

Also, note that from the first guess, we know that A is not at position 3 (which we already know because now A is at 1) and E is not at position 5 (which we already know because E is at 4). So no new constraints from that.

Now, we must choose a word that starts with A, ends with E in the fourth position? Actually, the word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5.

So the pattern is: A _ _ E _

But note: the E is at position 4, so the last letter (position 5) is still unknown.

We know the secret word has A at 1 and E at 4, so the word is: A _ _ E ?

We need to find a word that fits: A _ _ E _ and the missing letters are not in {C, R, T, D, I, U}.

Also, we have not used many common letters yet. We can try to use other common consonants and vowels.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, L, N, O, P, M, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

We can form words like: ABLE, AGLE (not a word), AISLE (but I is excluded), etc.

Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid excluded letters.

Pattern: A _ _ E _

Possible words:

- ABBEY? -> 5 letters? ABBEY has two B's and ends with Y? But pattern: A, B, B, E, Y -> but E is at position 4? Then the fifth is Y? So ""ABB E Y"" -> but that's A, B, B, E, Y -> positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:B, 4:E, 5:Y -> but we need the fourth to be E? Yes. However, we have two B's? And we don't know if B is allowed? We haven't tested B.

But we must avoid: C, R, T, D, I, U. B is not in that list, so it's allowed.

But is ABBEY a valid word? Yes.

But let's see if there are more common words.

Another: ABLE? But ABLE is 4 letters. We need 5. So not.

- AGILE? But I is excluded.

- ALONE: A, L, O, N, E -> but E is at position 5? We need E at position 4. So pattern: A _ _ E _ -> so the fourth letter must be E. In ALONE, the fourth letter is N? So not.

We need the fourth letter to be E. So the word must be: A _ _ E _

So the third letter is the one before E? So the word has the form: A X Y E Z, where X, Y, Z are letters to be chosen.

Now, we need English words of that form.

Some examples:

- APPLE: A, P, P, L, E -> but wait, the fourth letter is L? Then E is at fifth? But we need E at fourth? So no.

- AMPLE: A, M, P, L, E -> again, E at fifth? Not at fourth.

We need the fourth letter to be E. So the word must have E as the fourth letter.

For example: 
  A _ _ E A -> but then the last letter is A? But we already have A at first? And we don't know if A can be repeated? The feedback didn't show any duplicate, but it's possible.

But let's see: the first guess had no duplicate, and second guess had no duplicate. But the secret word might have duplicates? We don't know.

But to be safe, we can consider both cases.

However, let's list words that have E at position 4.

Common words:

- AZURE: A, Z, U, R, E -> but U and R are excluded? R is excluded from first guess? Yes, R is absent. So not.

- AWAKE: A, W, A, K, E -> but E is at fifth? Not fourth.

- ABASE: A, B, A, S, E -> E at fifth? Not fourth.

- ABATE: A, B, A, T, E -> T is excluded, and E at fifth.

- AGATE: A, G, A, T, E -> T excluded.

- ALATE: not common, and T excluded.

- AMAZE: A, M, A, Z, E -> E at fifth.

It seems difficult? Maybe I'm missing.

What about: A _ _ E _ 

Let me think of words that end with ""E"" in the fourth position? Actually, the fifth letter is after E? So the word ends with E? No, the fourth is E, then fifth is another letter.

So the word has the form: A??E?

Examples:

- AXLE: A, X, L, E, ? -> but AXLE is 4 letters? We need 5.

5-letter words:

- ANKLE: A, N, K, L, E -> but E is at fifth? Not fourth.

- APPLE: A, P, P, L, E -> E at fifth.

- ABUSE: A, B, U, S, E -> U is excluded? From second guess, U is absent. So not.

- AMUSE: A, M, U, S, E -> U excluded.

- AWAKE: A, W, A, K, E -> E at fifth.

Wait, I think I have a mistake: the pattern is A _ _ E _ meaning:

Position 1: A
Position 2: ?
Position 3: ?
Position 4: E
Position 5: ?

So the word ends with E? No, position 4 is E, so position 5 is the last letter and can be anything.

For example, ""ABASE"" is A, B, A, S, E -> positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:A, 4:S, 5:E -> so the fourth letter is S, not E. So that doesn't work.

We need the fourth letter to be E. So the word must have the fourth character as E.

For example, ""AGLEE""? Not a word.

""ALLEE"": A, L, L, E, E -> that's a word? It means a tree-lined path. But it has duplicate L and E? And E at position 4 and 5.

But let's see: A _ _ E _ -> so position 4 is E, and position 5 is the last letter.

In ""ALLEE"": 
  Position 1: A
  Position 2: L
  Position 3: L
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: E

So it fits the pattern.

But we have to check if the letters are allowed: L is not excluded, E is already known. But we have two E's? The secret word might have two E's? We don't know.

But in our feedback, we only know one E (at position 4) but there could be more.

Similarly, A is at position 1 and we don't know if there is another A.

But in this case, ""ALLEE"" has two E's and one A.

But we must avoid excluded letters: C, R, T, D, I, U. L is not excluded, so it's okay.

But is ""ALLEE"" common? Maybe not.

Another word: ""AGAPE"": A, G, A, P, E -> positions: 1:A, 2:G, 3:A, 4:P, 5:E -> fourth letter is P, not E.

""AMIDE"": A, M, I, D, E -> but I and D are excluded? From second guess, D and I are absent. So not.

""ANODE"": A, N, O, D, E -> D is excluded.

""ABODE"": A, B, O, D, E -> D excluded.

""ALIKE"": A, L, I, K, E -> I excluded.

It's challenging. Let me think of words that have E at position 4.

Another: ""AWARE"": A, W, A, R, E -> R is excluded.

""AZURE"": A, Z, U, R, E -> U and R excluded.

""OPERA"": but doesn't start with A.

We need to start with A.

""ARISE"": A, R, I, S, E -> R and I excluded.

""ABASE"": doesn't have E at 4.

Perhaps: ""AEGIS"" -> A, E, G, I, S -> but E is at position 2, not 4.

I think I need to search for words that start with A and have E as the fourth letter.

Some possibilities:

- ACNES: A, C, N, E, S -> but C is excluded? From first guess, C is absent. So not.

- ADZES: A, D, Z, E, S -> D is excluded.

- AGUES: A, G, U, E, S -> U excluded.

- ALMES: A, L, M, E, S -> this might work? ""ALMES"" is not a common word? It might be obsolete.

- ALECS: A, L, E, C, S -> but E is at position 3? Not 4.

- ALKYD: A, L, K, Y, D -> D excluded and no E at 4.

Perhaps I should consider that the secret word might have the letter E at position 4, and then the fifth letter is part of the word.

Another idea: ""APPEL"": A, P, P, E, L -> positions: 1:A, 2:P, 3:P, 4:E, 5:L -> yes! Fourth letter is E.

And ""APPEL"" is a valid word (a term in law or fencing).

Now, check the letters: A, P, P, E, L.

We know A and E are in the word (and we are placing A at 1 and E at 4, which is correct).

P and L are new letters, not excluded.

Also, no excluded letters: C, R, T, D, I, U are not in this word.

So ""APPEL"" is a candidate.

Other words:

- ARMER: but R excluded.

- ASTER: A, S, T, E, R -> T and R excluded.

- AVERT: A, V, E, R, T -> R and T excluded.

- ""ASKEW"": A, S, K, E, W -> fourth letter is E? Positions: 1:A, 2:S, 3:K, 4:E, 5:W -> yes.

""ASKEW"" is a common word.

Letters: A, S, K, E, W.

Excluded letters: none of these are in the excluded list (C,R,T,D,I,U).

So ""ASKEW"" is also a candidate.

Another: ""ASPEN"": A, S, P, E, N -> fourth letter is E? 1:A,2:S,3:P,4:E,5:N -> yes, but E is at position 4? No: in ""ASPEN"", the letters are A,S,P,E,N so position 4 is E? Let's count:

Position 1: A
Position 2: S
Position 3: P
Position 4: E
Position 5: N

Yes, so ""ASPEN"" has E at position 4.

But ""ASPEN"" is a proper noun? It's a tree, so it's acceptable.

But in Wordle, proper nouns are not used? Actually, Wordle uses common words, and ""ASPEN"" is a common noun.

But let's see: we have two good candidates: ""APPEL"" and ""ASKEW"" and ""ASPEN"".

We can choose one that uses more common letters to get information.

We know the first letter is A and fourth is E, so we are really guessing positions 2,3,5.

In ""APPEL"": positions 2:P, 3:P, 5:L
In ""ASKEW"": positions 2:S, 3:K, 5:W
In ""ASPEN"": positions 2:S, 3:P, 5:N

We want to maximize information. Since we have no information about the middle letters, we can choose a word that has common letters.

S is a very common letter, so ""ASKEW"" or ""ASPEN"" might be better.

Also, ""ASKEW"" has W which is less common, but it's okay.

Another common word: ""ASHEN"": A, S, H, E, N -> positions: 1:A,2:S,3:H,4:E,5:N -> yes.

""ASHEN"" is a word.

So candidates: APPEL, ASKEW, ASPEN, ASHEN.

We can choose ""ASHEN"" because it has S, H, N which are common.

But we don't have any information about H or N.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has a letter we haven't tried, to see if it's present.

But since we are constrained by the pattern, we have to choose a word that fits.

I think any of these are fine.

Let me pick ""ASHEN"" because it has common letters.

But note: we are also trying to get feedback on the letters in positions 2,3,5.

If we guess ""ASHEN"", then:

- A: already correct (position 1)
- S: if it is in the word, we'll get feedback on its position (position 2)
- H: similarly (position 3)
- E: already correct (position 4)
- N: similarly (position 5)

But we don't know if S, H, N are in the word.

Alternatively, if we guess ""APPEL"", we are guessing P at 2 and 3, and L at 5. But if P is not in the word, then we get two x's for the P's? That might be inefficient.

So ""ASHEN"" or ""ASKEW"" might be better because they have distinct letters.

Between ""ASHEN"" and ""ASKEW"", ""ASHEN"" has more common letters.

But let's see the frequency: S is very common, H is common, N is common.

In ""ASKEW"", S is common, K is common, W is less common.

So ""ASHEN"" might be better.

Another candidate: ""AXMEN"" -> not a word.

""AMBER"": A, M, B, E, R -> but R is excluded.

""ALBEE"": A, L, B, E, E -> has E at position 4 and 5? Positions: 1:A,2:L,3:B,4:E,5:E -> and E is at 4 and 5. But we know E is at 4, so if there is another E at 5, that's possible. But R is not in it? But we have to avoid R? ""ALBEE"" has no R, but it has B and L and E. But is it a word? It's a surname, but not common.

Stick to common words.

""ASHEN"" seems good.

But let's confirm: ""ASHEN"" means of a pale grayish color.

Yes.

So I'll go with ""ASHEN"".

But wait, in ""ASHEN"", the fourth letter is E? Let's spell: A-S-H-E-N -> positions: 1:A, 2:S, 3:H, 4:E, 5:N. Yes.

And no excluded letters.

So guess: ASHEN

But we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't have evidence, but it's possible.

But ""ASHEN"" has no duplicates.

So let's use that.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRATE**  
  Feedback: C(✗), R(✗), A(➖), T(✗), E(➖)  
  Interpretation:  
  - A and E are in the secret word but not in positions 3 or 5.  
  - C, R, and T are **absent** from the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: ADIEU**  
  Feedback: A(✓), D(✗), I(✗), E(✓), U(✗)  
  Interpretation:  
  - A is **correctly placed at position 1**.  
  - E is **correctly placed at position 4**.  
  - D, I, and U are **absent** from the secret word.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:  
   - Position 1: **A** (fixed).  
   - Position 4: **E** (fixed).  
   - The secret word structure is: `A _ _ E _`.  
   
2. **Absent Letters**:  
   - C, R, T (from Guess 1), and D, I, U (from Guess 2) are **not in the word**.  
   - Avoid using these letters in future guesses.  

3. **Unknown Positions**:  
   - Positions 2, 3, and 5 are unknown.  
   - We need to test new common letters (e.g., S, L, N, O, P, M, B, G, H, K) to gather more clues.  

4. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - The word must start with `A` and have `E` at position 4: `A _ _ E _`.  
   - Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, H, N, L, P) to maximize information.  
   - Avoid reused positions for known letters (A and E are fixed, so focus on positions 2, 3, 5).  
   - Ideal words should test high-frequency consonants/vowels in new positions.  

### Why ""ASHEN""?
- **Fits the Pattern**: `A _ _ E _` → A (pos1), S (pos2), H (pos3), E (pos4), N (pos5).  
- **Tests New Common Letters**:  
  - **S** (high-frequency), **H** (common), **N** (common) — all untested and not excluded.  
- **Avoids Absent Letters**: No C, R, T, D, I, or U.  
- **Information Gain**:  
  - If S, H, or N are in the secret word, feedback will reveal their positions/absence.  
  - If incorrect, we eliminate three common letters, narrowing possibilities significantly.  
- **Common Word**: ""ASHEN"" is a valid English word (meaning pale or grayish), fitting Wordle's dictionary.  

### Other Candidates Considered:
- **ASKEW**: `A S K E W` (tests S, K, W). Chose ""ASHEN"" over this because H and N are more frequent than K and W.  
- **ASPEN**: `A S P E N` (tests S, P, N). Similar to ""ASHEN"", but ""ASHEN"" includes H (slightly more common than P).  
- **APPEL**: `A P P E L` (tests P, L). Less ideal due to duplicate P, which reduces information if P is absent.  

<guess>ASHEN</guess>",ASHEN,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRATE
  C: x (absent)
  R: x (absent)
  A: - (present, but wrong position; not position 3)
  T: x (absent)
  E: - (present, but wrong position; not position 5)

Guess 2: ADIEU
  A: ✓ (correct position, so A is at position 1)
  D: x (absent)
  I: x (absent)
  E: ✓ (correct position, so E is at position 4)
  U: x (absent)

Now, we know:
- The secret word has A at position 1 and E at position 4.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, T, D, I, U.
- We have two known letters: A (pos1) and E (pos4).

The word structure is: A _ _ E _

We need to fill the middle three positions (positions 2, 3, and 5) with letters that are not in the excluded list (C, R, T, D, I, U) and are English letters.

Also, note that from the first guess, we know that A is not at position 3 (which we already know because now A is at 1) and E is not at position 5 (which we already know because E is at 4). So no new constraints from that.

Now, we must choose a word that starts with A, ends with E in the fourth position? Actually, the word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5.

So the pattern is: A _ _ E _

But note: the E is at position 4, so the last letter (position 5) is still unknown.

We know the secret word has A at 1 and E at 4, so the word is: A _ _ E ?

We need to find a word that fits: A _ _ E _ and the missing letters are not in {C, R, T, D, I, U}.

Also, we have not used many common letters yet. We can try to use other common consonants and vowels.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, L, N, O, P, M, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

We can form words like: ABLE, AGLE (not a word), AISLE (but I is excluded), etc.

Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid excluded letters.

Pattern: A _ _ E _

Possible words:

- ABBEY? -> 5 letters? ABBEY has two B's and ends with Y? But pattern: A, B, B, E, Y -> but E is at position 4? Then the fifth is Y? So ""ABB E Y"" -> but that's A, B, B, E, Y -> positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:B, 4:E, 5:Y -> but we need the fourth to be E? Yes. However, we have two B's? And we don't know if B is allowed? We haven't tested B.

But we must avoid: C, R, T, D, I, U. B is not in that list, so it's allowed.

But is ABBEY a valid word? Yes.

But let's see if there are more common words.

Another: ABLE? But ABLE is 4 letters. We need 5. So not.

- AGILE? But I is excluded.

- ALONE: A, L, O, N, E -> but E is at position 5? We need E at position 4. So pattern: A _ _ E _ -> so the fourth letter must be E. In ALONE, the fourth letter is N? So not.

We need the fourth letter to be E. So the word must be: A _ _ E _

So the third letter is the one before E? So the word has the form: A X Y E Z, where X, Y, Z are letters to be chosen.

Now, we need English words of that form.

Some examples:

- APPLE: A, P, P, L, E -> but wait, the fourth letter is L? Then E is at fifth? But we need E at fourth? So no.

- AMPLE: A, M, P, L, E -> again, E at fifth? Not at fourth.

We need the fourth letter to be E. So the word must have E as the fourth letter.

For example: 
  A _ _ E A -> but then the last letter is A? But we already have A at first? And we don't know if A can be repeated? The feedback didn't show any duplicate, but it's possible.

But let's see: the first guess had no duplicate, and second guess had no duplicate. But the secret word might have duplicates? We don't know.

But to be safe, we can consider both cases.

However, let's list words that have E at position 4.

Common words:

- AZURE: A, Z, U, R, E -> but U and R are excluded? R is excluded from first guess? Yes, R is absent. So not.

- AWAKE: A, W, A, K, E -> but E is at fifth? Not fourth.

- ABASE: A, B, A, S, E -> E at fifth? Not fourth.

- ABATE: A, B, A, T, E -> T is excluded, and E at fifth.

- AGATE: A, G, A, T, E -> T excluded.

- ALATE: not common, and T excluded.

- AMAZE: A, M, A, Z, E -> E at fifth.

It seems difficult? Maybe I'm missing.

What about: A _ _ E _ 

Let me think of words that end with ""E"" in the fourth position? Actually, the fifth letter is after E? So the word ends with E? No, the fourth is E, then fifth is another letter.

So the word has the form: A??E?

Examples:

- AXLE: A, X, L, E, ? -> but AXLE is 4 letters? We need 5.

5-letter words:

- ANKLE: A, N, K, L, E -> but E is at fifth? Not fourth.

- APPLE: A, P, P, L, E -> E at fifth.

- ABUSE: A, B, U, S, E -> U is excluded? From second guess, U is absent. So not.

- AMUSE: A, M, U, S, E -> U excluded.

- AWAKE: A, W, A, K, E -> E at fifth.

Wait, I think I have a mistake: the pattern is A _ _ E _ meaning:

Position 1: A
Position 2: ?
Position 3: ?
Position 4: E
Position 5: ?

So the word ends with E? No, position 4 is E, so position 5 is the last letter and can be anything.

For example, ""ABASE"" is A, B, A, S, E -> positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:A, 4:S, 5:E -> so the fourth letter is S, not E. So that doesn't work.

We need the fourth letter to be E. So the word must have the fourth character as E.

For example, ""AGLEE""? Not a word.

""ALLEE"": A, L, L, E, E -> that's a word? It means a tree-lined path. But it has duplicate L and E? And E at position 4 and 5.

But let's see: A _ _ E _ -> so position 4 is E, and position 5 is the last letter.

In ""ALLEE"": 
  Position 1: A
  Position 2: L
  Position 3: L
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: E

So it fits the pattern.

But we have to check if the letters are allowed: L is not excluded, E is already known. But we have two E's? The secret word might have two E's? We don't know.

But in our feedback, we only know one E (at position 4) but there could be more.

Similarly, A is at position 1 and we don't know if there is another A.

But in this case, ""ALLEE"" has two E's and one A.

But we must avoid excluded letters: C, R, T, D, I, U. L is not excluded, so it's okay.

But is ""ALLEE"" common? Maybe not.

Another word: ""AGAPE"": A, G, A, P, E -> positions: 1:A, 2:G, 3:A, 4:P, 5:E -> fourth letter is P, not E.

""AMIDE"": A, M, I, D, E -> but I and D are excluded? From second guess, D and I are absent. So not.

""ANODE"": A, N, O, D, E -> D is excluded.

""ABODE"": A, B, O, D, E -> D excluded.

""ALIKE"": A, L, I, K, E -> I excluded.

It's challenging. Let me think of words that have E at position 4.

Another: ""AWARE"": A, W, A, R, E -> R is excluded.

""AZURE"": A, Z, U, R, E -> U and R excluded.

""OPERA"": but doesn't start with A.

We need to start with A.

""ARISE"": A, R, I, S, E -> R and I excluded.

""ABASE"": doesn't have E at 4.

Perhaps: ""AEGIS"" -> A, E, G, I, S -> but E is at position 2, not 4.

I think I need to search for words that start with A and have E as the fourth letter.

Some possibilities:

- ACNES: A, C, N, E, S -> but C is excluded? From first guess, C is absent. So not.

- ADZES: A, D, Z, E, S -> D is excluded.

- AGUES: A, G, U, E, S -> U excluded.

- ALMES: A, L, M, E, S -> this might work? ""ALMES"" is not a common word? It might be obsolete.

- ALECS: A, L, E, C, S -> but E is at position 3? Not 4.

- ALKYD: A, L, K, Y, D -> D excluded and no E at 4.

Perhaps I should consider that the secret word might have the letter E at position 4, and then the fifth letter is part of the word.

Another idea: ""APPEL"": A, P, P, E, L -> positions: 1:A, 2:P, 3:P, 4:E, 5:L -> yes! Fourth letter is E.

And ""APPEL"" is a valid word (a term in law or fencing).

Now, check the letters: A, P, P, E, L.

We know A and E are in the word (and we are placing A at 1 and E at 4, which is correct).

P and L are new letters, not excluded.

Also, no excluded letters: C, R, T, D, I, U are not in this word.

So ""APPEL"" is a candidate.

Other words:

- ARMER: but R excluded.

- ASTER: A, S, T, E, R -> T and R excluded.

- AVERT: A, V, E, R, T -> R and T excluded.

- ""ASKEW"": A, S, K, E, W -> fourth letter is E? Positions: 1:A, 2:S, 3:K, 4:E, 5:W -> yes.

""ASKEW"" is a common word.

Letters: A, S, K, E, W.

Excluded letters: none of these are in the excluded list (C,R,T,D,I,U).

So ""ASKEW"" is also a candidate.

Another: ""ASPEN"": A, S, P, E, N -> fourth letter is E? 1:A,2:S,3:P,4:E,5:N -> yes, but E is at position 4? No: in ""ASPEN"", the letters are A,S,P,E,N so position 4 is E? Let's count:

Position 1: A
Position 2: S
Position 3: P
Position 4: E
Position 5: N

Yes, so ""ASPEN"" has E at position 4.

But ""ASPEN"" is a proper noun? It's a tree, so it's acceptable.

But in Wordle, proper nouns are not used? Actually, Wordle uses common words, and ""ASPEN"" is a common noun.

But let's see: we have two good candidates: ""APPEL"" and ""ASKEW"" and ""ASPEN"".

We can choose one that uses more common letters to get information.

We know the first letter is A and fourth is E, so we are really guessing positions 2,3,5.

In ""APPEL"": positions 2:P, 3:P, 5:L
In ""ASKEW"": positions 2:S, 3:K, 5:W
In ""ASPEN"": positions 2:S, 3:P, 5:N

We want to maximize information. Since we have no information about the middle letters, we can choose a word that has common letters.

S is a very common letter, so ""ASKEW"" or ""ASPEN"" might be better.

Also, ""ASKEW"" has W which is less common, but it's okay.

Another common word: ""ASHEN"": A, S, H, E, N -> positions: 1:A,2:S,3:H,4:E,5:N -> yes.

""ASHEN"" is a word.

So candidates: APPEL, ASKEW, ASPEN, ASHEN.

We can choose ""ASHEN"" because it has S, H, N which are common.

But we don't have any information about H or N.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has a letter we haven't tried, to see if it's present.

But since we are constrained by the pattern, we have to choose a word that fits.

I think any of these are fine.

Let me pick ""ASHEN"" because it has common letters.

But note: we are also trying to get feedback on the letters in positions 2,3,5.

If we guess ""ASHEN"", then:

- A: already correct (position 1)
- S: if it is in the word, we'll get feedback on its position (position 2)
- H: similarly (position 3)
- E: already correct (position 4)
- N: similarly (position 5)

But we don't know if S, H, N are in the word.

Alternatively, if we guess ""APPEL"", we are guessing P at 2 and 3, and L at 5. But if P is not in the word, then we get two x's for the P's? That might be inefficient.

So ""ASHEN"" or ""ASKEW"" might be better because they have distinct letters.

Between ""ASHEN"" and ""ASKEW"", ""ASHEN"" has more common letters.

But let's see the frequency: S is very common, H is common, N is common.

In ""ASKEW"", S is common, K is common, W is less common.

So ""ASHEN"" might be better.

Another candidate: ""AXMEN"" -> not a word.

""AMBER"": A, M, B, E, R -> but R is excluded.

""ALBEE"": A, L, B, E, E -> has E at position 4 and 5? Positions: 1:A,2:L,3:B,4:E,5:E -> and E is at 4 and 5. But we know E is at 4, so if there is another E at 5, that's possible. But R is not in it? But we have to avoid R? ""ALBEE"" has no R, but it has B and L and E. But is it a word? It's a surname, but not common.

Stick to common words.

""ASHEN"" seems good.

But let's confirm: ""ASHEN"" means of a pale grayish color.

Yes.

So I'll go with ""ASHEN"".

But wait, in ""ASHEN"", the fourth letter is E? Let's spell: A-S-H-E-N -> positions: 1:A, 2:S, 3:H, 4:E, 5:N. Yes.

And no excluded letters.

So guess: ASHEN

But we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't have evidence, but it's possible.

But ""ASHEN"" has no duplicates.

So let's use that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior information. We need to pick a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have:
   - Common letters to maximize information.
   - Preferably no duplicate letters to cover more ground.

 Some common starting words in Wordle are: ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that uses common vowels and consonants to cover a broad set of letters.

 I am considering: ""CRATE""

 Why ""CRATE""?
   - It contains 'C', 'R', 'A', 'T', 'E'. These are common letters.
   - It includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 However, note that the word ""ROAST"" is also a good one because it has common letters and R and S are very common.

 Let me compare:
   - ""RAISE"" has R, A, I, S, E. It includes three vowels (A, I, E) which might be helpful.

 But since it's the first guess, we can choose any of these. 

 I'll go with ""RAISE"". It gives us three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This can help us quickly identify vowels in the word.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also popular.

 After consideration, I'll choose ""CRATE"" because it is frequently used and covers common letters.

 But note: The feedback we get will help us narrow down the next guess.

 Since the instructions don't specify any restriction, I'll use ""CRATE"".

 However, let me check: the example used BRISK. We don't want to bias too much.

 So my first guess: ""CRATE""

 We'll submit it and then get feedback for the next guess.I'm starting the game without any prior clues. For an optimal first guess, I should choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the potential feedback. The word should include frequent vowels and consonants while avoiding duplicate letters to cover more ground. 

""CRATE"" is a strong choice because:
- Contains common letters: C, R, A, T, E
- Includes two vowels (A, E) and three consonants
- Covers frequent letters found in English 5-letter words

This guess will likely provide helpful feedback on letter presence and positioning for subsequent guesses.

<guess>CRATE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess: CRATE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), T(x), E(-)
 This means:
   - A and E are in the secret word but not in the positions they were guessed (since they are marked as -).
   - C, R, T are not in the secret word at all (marked as x).

 Important: Since A and E are present but not in the guessed positions, we know:
   - The word contains A and E, but the A is not at position 3 (since in CRATE, A is the third letter) and E is not at position 5.

 Also, note that positions: 
   C (1st) -> absent
   R (2nd) -> absent
   A (3rd) -> present but wrong position
   T (4th) -> absent
   E (5th) -> present but wrong position

 Now, we have two confirmed letters: A and E.

 For the next guess, we need to:
   - Choose a 5-letter English word that includes A and E (since they are in the secret word).
   - Avoid using any of the absent letters: C, R, T (because they are not in the word at all). Also note that R was absent in the first guess, so R is not in the word? Wait, but the feedback for R was (x) meaning it is not in the word. Similarly for C and T.

 However, note: It's possible that a letter might appear more than once? But the rules don't specify. In Wordle, usually words can have repeated letters, but in this feedback, we must note:
   - The feedback symbol for each instance is independent. Since we only guessed one of each, and they were marked as absent, that means at least in those positions we don't have them. But if a letter is marked absent, it means that the total count of that letter in the secret word is less than the count we guessed? Actually, standard Wordle rules: if a letter is not in the word at all, it gets marked absent. If it is in the word but we have more copies than in the word, then the extra copies might be marked absent.

 Since we have only one instance of each in the guess, and they are marked absent, we can assume that the secret word does not contain C, R, or T.

 But wait: what about the letter R? We guessed R in position 2 and it was marked absent. Similarly, T in position 4 absent. So we know R and T are not in the word.

 Therefore, we must avoid letters C, R, T.

 Additionally, we know A and E are in the word, but not in positions 3 and 5.

 Now, let's think of a good next guess.

 We should look for words that:
   - Are 5 letters
   - Contain A and E
   - Exclude C, R, T
   - Also, we can try to use common letters to get more information.

 Since A and E are already confirmed, we can put them in different positions. Remember A cannot be at position 3 and E cannot be at position 5.

 We have three positions to fill: 1, 2, 4 (since position 3 must not be A and position 5 must not be E, but note: we might put A or E in one of the other positions? Actually, we can put A in 1,2,4 or 5? But we already know E cannot be at 5? However, we might put E in 1,2,3, or 4? Similarly, A in 1,2,4,5? But we don't know about position 1 and 2 and 4.

 We must also choose letters that are common and haven't been ruled out.

 Available letters: except C,R,T, and we know A and E are in the word.

 Let me think: we have 26 letters minus C,R,T -> 23 letters. But we might include other common letters.

 I am considering using a word with A and E and three new letters.

 A good strategy is to try to cover vowel possibilities and common consonants.

 Since we know A and E are present, we can focus on finding positions and including other common vowels/consonants.

 Common letters: S, L, N, O, I, D, H, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that includes A and E and three of these, avoiding C,R,T.

 Also, we must avoid placing A at position 3 and E at position 5.

 Some word ideas:

 - Option: ""LEMON"": but this has O and M? Wait, but it also has L,E,M,O,N -> but we are missing A? We must include A, because A is confirmed.

 So we need words that have A and E.

 Some words that contain A and E: ""LATHE"" -> but T is ruled out? No, T is absent so we cannot use T.

 Another: ""SLATE"" -> but has T, which is ruled out? And also R? No, SLATE has T? We cannot use T.

 Words without C,R,T and with A and E:

   ""AGILE"": contains A, G, I, L, E? -> Yes. But note positions:
      Position 1: A -> however, we don't know if A can be at position 1? Our feedback didn't rule that out.
      Position 5: E -> but in the first guess, E was at position 5 and we know it's not there? So putting E at position 5 would be bad? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? But we can put E elsewhere.

   In ""AGILE"":
      A at 1, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is the same as before? We know E is not at 5, so if we put E at 5, we are going to get a '-' because E is in the word but wrong position? Actually, we are not sure: the feedback for E at position 5 was '-', meaning that E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we guess E again at position 5, we would get '-' again (if the secret word doesn't have E at 5) or '✓' if by chance it is? But we already know it's not at 5, so putting E at position 5 again is wasteful.

   So ideally, we put E at a new position (either 1,2,3,4) and similarly A at a new position (not 3).

   For AGILE: 
        Position 1: A -> if we put A at 1, we might get:
            If the secret word has A at 1: ✓
            If not: then '-' meaning A is present but not at 1 (and also not at 3) so it would be in 2,4 or 5? But wait, if the secret word has A at 4, then we will get '-' for A at 1.
        Position 5: E -> this is the same position as before, and we know E is not at 5, so we will get '-' for E again? So that doesn't tell us anything new about E.

   So let's avoid putting E at position 5.

   We can choose a word that puts E at positions 1,2,3,4 and A at 1,2,4,5 (but not 3 and also we avoid the same position if we can get new information).

   Example words:

     - Place A at position 1: e.g., ""ABIDE"" -> includes A at 1 and E at 5? But we don't want E at 5. Also, E at 5 is the same as before? So no.

     - Place E at position 1: ""EARLY"" -> but has R? We cannot use R.

     - ""LEAST"": but has T? Cannot use T.

     - ""PASTE"": again, has S, T -> T is not allowed.

     - ""DATE"": only 4 letters? Must be 5.

     - Let me think: words without C,R,T and with A and E, and E not at 5.

     Some candidates:

        ""SNAKE"": 
            S, N, A, K, E -> includes S,N,A,K,E -> no R,T,C.
            Positions: 
               S:1, N:2, A:3 -> but wait, the first guess ruled out A at position 3? So if we put A at 3 again, we will get '-' (since A is present but not at position 3). But we already know that? So it doesn't give new information? Ideally, we want to put A in a new position to test.

        ""PLANE"":
            P,L,A,N,E -> no C,R,T.
            Positions: A at 3? Again, same as before.

        We cannot put A at position 3? So we need a word that has A not at position 3 and also E not at position 5.

        How about ""PLANE"" but rearrange? We can't rearrange arbitrarily, must be a valid word.

        Let me list:

          ""ADIEU"": has A and E, and vowels? But let's see:
             A:1, D:2, I:3, E:4, U:5 -> note E is at position 4, not 5? and A is at 1. 
          But does it avoid C,R,T? Yes.

          However, the first guess had A at 3 and E at 5. Now we have A at 1 and E at 4.

          This seems good: because we are testing A at a different position and E at a different position.

        Also, ""ADIEU"" is a common word used in Wordle as a starter? But we are not using it as starter. But okay.

        What other words?

        ""AISLE"": 
            A at 1, E at 5? But E at 5 we know is not correct? So that's inefficient.

        ""ABASE"":
            A at 1, B, A, S, E -> wait, duplicate A? Not necessarily bad, but we don't know if the secret word has two A's. However, we know A is present at least once. But our guess has two A's? So if the secret word has exactly one A, then one A might be marked ✓ or - and the other marked x? But that might give extra info? But let's avoid duplication for now?

        ""ADIEU"" seems efficient because:
          - It uses A and E (which we know are in the word)
          - It places A at position 1 (which we haven't tested) and E at position 4 (which we haven't tested)
          - And includes D, I, U which are new letters.

        Also, it avoids C,R,T.

        But note: in the feedback we got, A was marked as present but wrong position. What if the secret word has A at position 1? Then by guessing A at position 1, we'll get a ✓ for A? Similarly, if E is at position 4, we get ✓. Otherwise, we might get more '-' or even a ✓ if A is at 1 or E at 4.

        So let's choose ""ADIEU"".

        Another option: ""MEDIA"": 
            M,E,D,I,A -> positions: E at 2, A at 5 -> but A at 5: we haven't tested A at 5? And E at 2? That's good. Also, avoids C,R,T.

        But ""ADIEU"" and ""MEDIA"" are both valid. 

        How about ""ANIME"": 
            A at 1, N, I, M, E -> E at 5? again.

        So ""MEDIA"" puts E at 2 and A at 5? But note: in the first guess, we had E at 5? And we know E is not at position 5? So putting A at 5 and E at 2? That seems okay.

        However, we know E is present but not at position 5. If we put E at 2 and get a '-', that tells us E is in the word but not at 2? Then we know it must be at 1,3 or 4? Similarly, for A we know it is not at 3. So if we put A at 5, and we get '-', that tells us A is not at 5? Then A must be at 1,2, or 4? But we don't have a test for A at 1? We did test A at 3 and now at 5? So not covering position 1 or 2.

        Alternatively, with ""ADIEU"": 
          Positions for A: 1 -> test position 1
          Positions for E: 4 -> test position 4

        So if we get:
          A at 1: ✓ or '-'? 
          E at 4: ✓ or '-'?

        That would be more informative because we are testing two new positions.

        Also, in ""MEDIA"", E at 2 and A at 5? We test E at 2 and A at 5? But we already know E cannot be at 5? And we don't have a test for A at 1? So ""ADIEU"" seems better.

        However, note: what if the secret word has A and E? And we are testing A at 1 and E at 4? That might get us two ✓ if they are correctly placed? Otherwise, if not, we get information.

        I'll go with ""ADIEU"".

        So the second guess: ADIEU

        But note: ""ADIEU"" is a valid English word? Yes, it means goodbye.

        Also, it has the following letters: A, D, I, E, U. None of the absent letters.

        So let's use that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"", I analyzed the following:
- C, R, and T are **NOT** in the secret word (marked ✗).
- A and E are in the word but NOT in positions 3 and 5 respectively (marked -).
- Therefore, the secret word contains A and E but excludes C, R, T.

For the second guess, I prioritized:
1. **Including A and E** while avoiding C, R, T.
2. **Testing new positions**: A should not be in position 3 (already tested), and E should not be in position 5 (already tested). I chose positions that maximize new information: A in position 1 and E in position 4.
3. **Covering new common letters**: S, L, N, P, D, I, etc., to gather more clues.
4. **Avoiding reused positions** for known letters to learn about their correct placements.

""ADIEU"" is a strong choice because:
- Contains A (position 1) and E (position 4), both in new untested positions.
- Avoids C, R, T; introduces new letters: D, I, U.
- Tests vowel-heavy combinations efficiently, helping narrow down possibilities.

<guess>ADIEU</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ADIEU -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) I(x) E(✓) U(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRATE
  C: x (absent)
  R: x (absent)
  A: - (present, but wrong position; not position 3)
  T: x (absent)
  E: - (present, but wrong position; not position 5)

Guess 2: ADIEU
  A: ✓ (correct position, so A is at position 1)
  D: x (absent)
  I: x (absent)
  E: ✓ (correct position, so E is at position 4)
  U: x (absent)

Now, we know:
- The secret word has A at position 1 and E at position 4.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, T, D, I, U.
- We have two known letters: A (pos1) and E (pos4).

The word structure is: A _ _ E _

We need to fill the middle three positions (positions 2, 3, and 5) with letters that are not in the excluded list (C, R, T, D, I, U) and are English letters.

Also, note that from the first guess, we know that A is not at position 3 (which we already know because now A is at 1) and E is not at position 5 (which we already know because E is at 4). So no new constraints from that.

Now, we must choose a word that starts with A, ends with E in the fourth position? Actually, the word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5.

So the pattern is: A _ _ E _

But note: the E is at position 4, so the last letter (position 5) is still unknown.

We know the secret word has A at 1 and E at 4, so the word is: A _ _ E ?

We need to find a word that fits: A _ _ E _ and the missing letters are not in {C, R, T, D, I, U}.

Also, we have not used many common letters yet. We can try to use other common consonants and vowels.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, L, N, O, P, M, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

We can form words like: ABLE, AGLE (not a word), AISLE (but I is excluded), etc.

Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid excluded letters.

Pattern: A _ _ E _

Possible words:

- ABBEY? -> 5 letters? ABBEY has two B's and ends with Y? But pattern: A, B, B, E, Y -> but E is at position 4? Then the fifth is Y? So ""ABB E Y"" -> but that's A, B, B, E, Y -> positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:B, 4:E, 5:Y -> but we need the fourth to be E? Yes. However, we have two B's? And we don't know if B is allowed? We haven't tested B.

But we must avoid: C, R, T, D, I, U. B is not in that list, so it's allowed.

But is ABBEY a valid word? Yes.

But let's see if there are more common words.

Another: ABLE? But ABLE is 4 letters. We need 5. So not.

- AGILE? But I is excluded.

- ALONE: A, L, O, N, E -> but E is at position 5? We need E at position 4. So pattern: A _ _ E _ -> so the fourth letter must be E. In ALONE, the fourth letter is N? So not.

We need the fourth letter to be E. So the word must be: A _ _ E _

So the third letter is the one before E? So the word has the form: A X Y E Z, where X, Y, Z are letters to be chosen.

Now, we need English words of that form.

Some examples:

- APPLE: A, P, P, L, E -> but wait, the fourth letter is L? Then E is at fifth? But we need E at fourth? So no.

- AMPLE: A, M, P, L, E -> again, E at fifth? Not at fourth.

We need the fourth letter to be E. So the word must have E as the fourth letter.

For example: 
  A _ _ E A -> but then the last letter is A? But we already have A at first? And we don't know if A can be repeated? The feedback didn't show any duplicate, but it's possible.

But let's see: the first guess had no duplicate, and second guess had no duplicate. But the secret word might have duplicates? We don't know.

But to be safe, we can consider both cases.

However, let's list words that have E at position 4.

Common words:

- AZURE: A, Z, U, R, E -> but U and R are excluded? R is excluded from first guess? Yes, R is absent. So not.

- AWAKE: A, W, A, K, E -> but E is at fifth? Not fourth.

- ABASE: A, B, A, S, E -> E at fifth? Not fourth.

- ABATE: A, B, A, T, E -> T is excluded, and E at fifth.

- AGATE: A, G, A, T, E -> T excluded.

- ALATE: not common, and T excluded.

- AMAZE: A, M, A, Z, E -> E at fifth.

It seems difficult? Maybe I'm missing.

What about: A _ _ E _ 

Let me think of words that end with ""E"" in the fourth position? Actually, the fifth letter is after E? So the word ends with E? No, the fourth is E, then fifth is another letter.

So the word has the form: A??E?

Examples:

- AXLE: A, X, L, E, ? -> but AXLE is 4 letters? We need 5.

5-letter words:

- ANKLE: A, N, K, L, E -> but E is at fifth? Not fourth.

- APPLE: A, P, P, L, E -> E at fifth.

- ABUSE: A, B, U, S, E -> U is excluded? From second guess, U is absent. So not.

- AMUSE: A, M, U, S, E -> U excluded.

- AWAKE: A, W, A, K, E -> E at fifth.

Wait, I think I have a mistake: the pattern is A _ _ E _ meaning:

Position 1: A
Position 2: ?
Position 3: ?
Position 4: E
Position 5: ?

So the word ends with E? No, position 4 is E, so position 5 is the last letter and can be anything.

For example, ""ABASE"" is A, B, A, S, E -> positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:A, 4:S, 5:E -> so the fourth letter is S, not E. So that doesn't work.

We need the fourth letter to be E. So the word must have the fourth character as E.

For example, ""AGLEE""? Not a word.

""ALLEE"": A, L, L, E, E -> that's a word? It means a tree-lined path. But it has duplicate L and E? And E at position 4 and 5.

But let's see: A _ _ E _ -> so position 4 is E, and position 5 is the last letter.

In ""ALLEE"": 
  Position 1: A
  Position 2: L
  Position 3: L
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: E

So it fits the pattern.

But we have to check if the letters are allowed: L is not excluded, E is already known. But we have two E's? The secret word might have two E's? We don't know.

But in our feedback, we only know one E (at position 4) but there could be more.

Similarly, A is at position 1 and we don't know if there is another A.

But in this case, ""ALLEE"" has two E's and one A.

But we must avoid excluded letters: C, R, T, D, I, U. L is not excluded, so it's okay.

But is ""ALLEE"" common? Maybe not.

Another word: ""AGAPE"": A, G, A, P, E -> positions: 1:A, 2:G, 3:A, 4:P, 5:E -> fourth letter is P, not E.

""AMIDE"": A, M, I, D, E -> but I and D are excluded? From second guess, D and I are absent. So not.

""ANODE"": A, N, O, D, E -> D is excluded.

""ABODE"": A, B, O, D, E -> D excluded.

""ALIKE"": A, L, I, K, E -> I excluded.

It's challenging. Let me think of words that have E at position 4.

Another: ""AWARE"": A, W, A, R, E -> R is excluded.

""AZURE"": A, Z, U, R, E -> U and R excluded.

""OPERA"": but doesn't start with A.

We need to start with A.

""ARISE"": A, R, I, S, E -> R and I excluded.

""ABASE"": doesn't have E at 4.

Perhaps: ""AEGIS"" -> A, E, G, I, S -> but E is at position 2, not 4.

I think I need to search for words that start with A and have E as the fourth letter.

Some possibilities:

- ACNES: A, C, N, E, S -> but C is excluded? From first guess, C is absent. So not.

- ADZES: A, D, Z, E, S -> D is excluded.

- AGUES: A, G, U, E, S -> U excluded.

- ALMES: A, L, M, E, S -> this might work? ""ALMES"" is not a common word? It might be obsolete.

- ALECS: A, L, E, C, S -> but E is at position 3? Not 4.

- ALKYD: A, L, K, Y, D -> D excluded and no E at 4.

Perhaps I should consider that the secret word might have the letter E at position 4, and then the fifth letter is part of the word.

Another idea: ""APPEL"": A, P, P, E, L -> positions: 1:A, 2:P, 3:P, 4:E, 5:L -> yes! Fourth letter is E.

And ""APPEL"" is a valid word (a term in law or fencing).

Now, check the letters: A, P, P, E, L.

We know A and E are in the word (and we are placing A at 1 and E at 4, which is correct).

P and L are new letters, not excluded.

Also, no excluded letters: C, R, T, D, I, U are not in this word.

So ""APPEL"" is a candidate.

Other words:

- ARMER: but R excluded.

- ASTER: A, S, T, E, R -> T and R excluded.

- AVERT: A, V, E, R, T -> R and T excluded.

- ""ASKEW"": A, S, K, E, W -> fourth letter is E? Positions: 1:A, 2:S, 3:K, 4:E, 5:W -> yes.

""ASKEW"" is a common word.

Letters: A, S, K, E, W.

Excluded letters: none of these are in the excluded list (C,R,T,D,I,U).

So ""ASKEW"" is also a candidate.

Another: ""ASPEN"": A, S, P, E, N -> fourth letter is E? 1:A,2:S,3:P,4:E,5:N -> yes, but E is at position 4? No: in ""ASPEN"", the letters are A,S,P,E,N so position 4 is E? Let's count:

Position 1: A
Position 2: S
Position 3: P
Position 4: E
Position 5: N

Yes, so ""ASPEN"" has E at position 4.

But ""ASPEN"" is a proper noun? It's a tree, so it's acceptable.

But in Wordle, proper nouns are not used? Actually, Wordle uses common words, and ""ASPEN"" is a common noun.

But let's see: we have two good candidates: ""APPEL"" and ""ASKEW"" and ""ASPEN"".

We can choose one that uses more common letters to get information.

We know the first letter is A and fourth is E, so we are really guessing positions 2,3,5.

In ""APPEL"": positions 2:P, 3:P, 5:L
In ""ASKEW"": positions 2:S, 3:K, 5:W
In ""ASPEN"": positions 2:S, 3:P, 5:N

We want to maximize information. Since we have no information about the middle letters, we can choose a word that has common letters.

S is a very common letter, so ""ASKEW"" or ""ASPEN"" might be better.

Also, ""ASKEW"" has W which is less common, but it's okay.

Another common word: ""ASHEN"": A, S, H, E, N -> positions: 1:A,2:S,3:H,4:E,5:N -> yes.

""ASHEN"" is a word.

So candidates: APPEL, ASKEW, ASPEN, ASHEN.

We can choose ""ASHEN"" because it has S, H, N which are common.

But we don't have any information about H or N.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has a letter we haven't tried, to see if it's present.

But since we are constrained by the pattern, we have to choose a word that fits.

I think any of these are fine.

Let me pick ""ASHEN"" because it has common letters.

But note: we are also trying to get feedback on the letters in positions 2,3,5.

If we guess ""ASHEN"", then:

- A: already correct (position 1)
- S: if it is in the word, we'll get feedback on its position (position 2)
- H: similarly (position 3)
- E: already correct (position 4)
- N: similarly (position 5)

But we don't know if S, H, N are in the word.

Alternatively, if we guess ""APPEL"", we are guessing P at 2 and 3, and L at 5. But if P is not in the word, then we get two x's for the P's? That might be inefficient.

So ""ASHEN"" or ""ASKEW"" might be better because they have distinct letters.

Between ""ASHEN"" and ""ASKEW"", ""ASHEN"" has more common letters.

But let's see the frequency: S is very common, H is common, N is common.

In ""ASKEW"", S is common, K is common, W is less common.

So ""ASHEN"" might be better.

Another candidate: ""AXMEN"" -> not a word.

""AMBER"": A, M, B, E, R -> but R is excluded.

""ALBEE"": A, L, B, E, E -> has E at position 4 and 5? Positions: 1:A,2:L,3:B,4:E,5:E -> and E is at 4 and 5. But we know E is at 4, so if there is another E at 5, that's possible. But R is not in it? But we have to avoid R? ""ALBEE"" has no R, but it has B and L and E. But is it a word? It's a surname, but not common.

Stick to common words.

""ASHEN"" seems good.

But let's confirm: ""ASHEN"" means of a pale grayish color.

Yes.

So I'll go with ""ASHEN"".

But wait, in ""ASHEN"", the fourth letter is E? Let's spell: A-S-H-E-N -> positions: 1:A, 2:S, 3:H, 4:E, 5:N. Yes.

And no excluded letters.

So guess: ASHEN

But we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't have evidence, but it's possible.

But ""ASHEN"" has no duplicates.

So let's use that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRATE**  
  Feedback: C(✗), R(✗), A(➖), T(✗), E(➖)  
  Interpretation:  
  - A and E are in the secret word but not in positions 3 or 5.  
  - C, R, and T are **absent** from the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: ADIEU**  
  Feedback: A(✓), D(✗), I(✗), E(✓), U(✗)  
  Interpretation:  
  - A is **correctly placed at position 1**.  
  - E is **correctly placed at position 4**.  
  - D, I, and U are **absent** from the secret word.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:  
   - Position 1: **A** (fixed).  
   - Position 4: **E** (fixed).  
   - The secret word structure is: `A _ _ E _`.  
   
2. **Absent Letters**:  
   - C, R, T (from Guess 1), and D, I, U (from Guess 2) are **not in the word**.  
   - Avoid using these letters in future guesses.  

3. **Unknown Positions**:  
   - Positions 2, 3, and 5 are unknown.  
   - We need to test new common letters (e.g., S, L, N, O, P, M, B, G, H, K) to gather more clues.  

4. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - The word must start with `A` and have `E` at position 4: `A _ _ E _`.  
   - Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, H, N, L, P) to maximize information.  
   - Avoid reused positions for known letters (A and E are fixed, so focus on positions 2, 3, 5).  
   - Ideal words should test high-frequency consonants/vowels in new positions.  

### Why ""ASHEN""?
- **Fits the Pattern**: `A _ _ E _` → A (pos1), S (pos2), H (pos3), E (pos4), N (pos5).  
- **Tests New Common Letters**:  
  - **S** (high-frequency), **H** (common), **N** (common) — all untested and not excluded.  
- **Avoids Absent Letters**: No C, R, T, D, I, or U.  
- **Information Gain**:  
  - If S, H, or N are in the secret word, feedback will reveal their positions/absence.  
  - If incorrect, we eliminate three common letters, narrowing possibilities significantly.  
- **Common Word**: ""ASHEN"" is a valid English word (meaning pale or grayish), fitting Wordle's dictionary.  

### Other Candidates Considered:
- **ASKEW**: `A S K E W` (tests S, K, W). Chose ""ASHEN"" over this because H and N are more frequent than K and W.  
- **ASPEN**: `A S P E N` (tests S, P, N). Similar to ""ASHEN"", but ""ASHEN"" includes H (slightly more common than P).  
- **APPEL**: `A P P E L` (tests P, L). Less ideal due to duplicate P, which reduces information if P is absent.

These are common letters.\n   - It includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.\n\n However, note that the word ""ROAST"" is also a good one because it has common letters and R and S are very common.\n\n Let me compare:\n   - ""RAISE"" has R, A, I, S, E.

For an optimal first guess, I should choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the potential feedback. The word should include frequent vowels and consonants while avoiding duplicate letters to cover more ground. \n\n""CRATE"" is a strong choice because:\n- Contains common letters: C, R, A, T, E\n- Includes two vowels (A, E) and three consonants\n- Covers frequent letters found in English 5-letter words\n\nThis guess will likely provide helpful feedback on letter presence and positioning for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>CRATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess: CRATE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), T(x), E(-)\n This means:\n   - A and E are in the secret word but not in the positions they were guessed (since they are marked as -).\n   - C, R, T are not in the secret word at all (marked as x).\n\n Important: Since A and E are present but not in the guessed positions, we know:\n   - The word contains A and E, but the A is not at position 3 (since in CRATE, A is the third letter) and E is not at position 5.\n\n Also, note that positions: \n   C (1st) -> absent\n   R (2nd) -> absent\n   A (3rd) -> present but wrong position\n   T (4th) -> absent\n   E (5th) -> present but wrong position\n\n Now, we have two confirmed letters: A and E.\n\n For the next guess, we need to:\n   - Choose a 5-letter English word that includes A and E (since they are in the secret word).\n   - Avoid using any of the absent letters: C, R, T (because they are not in the word at all). Also note that R was absent in the first guess, so R is not in the word? Wait, but the feedback for R was (x) meaning it is not in the word. Similarly for C and T.\n\n However, note: It\'s possible that a letter might appear more than once? But the rules don\'t specify. In Wordle, usually words can have repeated letters, but in this feedback, we must note:\n   - The feedback symbol for each instance is independent. Since we only guessed one of each, and they were marked as absent, that means at least in those positions we don\'t have them. But if a letter is marked absent, it means that the total count of that letter in the secret word is less than the count we guessed? Actually, standard Wordle rules: if a letter is not in the word at all, it gets marked absent. If it is in the word but we have more copies than in the word, then the extra copies might be marked absent.\n\n Since we have only one instance of each in the guess, and they are marked absent, we can assume that the secret word does not contain C, R, or T.\n\n But wait: what about the letter R? We guessed R in position 2 and it was marked absent. Similarly, T in position 4 absent. So we know R and T are not in the word.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid letters C, R, T.\n\n Additionally, we know A and E are in the word, but not in positions 3 and 5.\n\n Now, let\'s think of a good next guess.\n\n We should look for words that:\n   - Are 5 letters\n   - Contain A and E\n   - Exclude C, R, T\n   - Also, we can try to use common letters to get more information.\n\n Since A and E are already confirmed, we can put them in different positions. Remember A cannot be at position 3 and E cannot be at position 5.\n\n We have three positions to fill: 1, 2, 4 (since position 3 must not be A and position 5 must not be E, but note: we might put A or E in one of the other positions? Actually, we can put A in 1,2,4 or 5? But we already know E cannot be at 5? However, we might put E in 1,2,3, or 4? Similarly, A in 1,2,4,5? But we don\'t know about position 1 and 2 and 4.\n\n We must also choose letters that are common and haven\'t been ruled out.\n\n Available letters: except C,R,T, and we know A and E are in the word.\n\n Let me think: we have 26 letters minus C,R,T -> 23 letters. But we might include other common letters.\n\n I am considering using a word with A and E and three new letters.\n\n A good strategy is to try to cover vowel possibilities and common consonants.\n\n Since we know A and E are present, we can focus on finding positions and including other common vowels/consonants.\n\n Common letters: S, L, N, O, I, D, H, etc.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that includes A and E and three of these, avoiding C,R,T.\n\n Also, we must avoid placing A at position 3 and E at position 5.\n\n Some word ideas:\n\n - Option: ""LEMON"": but this has O and M? Wait, but it also has L,E,M,O,N -> but we are missing A? We must include A, because A is confirmed.\n\n So we need words that have A and E.\n\n Some words that contain A and E: ""LATHE"" -> but T is ruled out? No, T is absent so we cannot use T.\n\n Another: ""SLATE"" -> but has T, which is ruled out? And also R? No, SLATE has T? We cannot use T.\n\n Words without C,R,T and with A and E:\n\n   ""AGILE"": contains A, G, I, L, E? -> Yes. But note positions:\n      Position 1: A -> however, we don\'t know if A can be at position 1? Our feedback didn\'t rule that out.\n      Position 5: E -> but in the first guess, E was at position 5 and we know it\'s not there? So putting E at position 5 would be bad? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? But we can put E elsewhere.\n\n   In ""AGILE"":\n      A at 1, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is the same as before? We know E is not at 5, so if we put E at 5, we are going to get a \'-\' because E is in the word but wrong position? Actually, we are not sure: the feedback for E at position 5 was \'-\', meaning that E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we guess E again at position 5, we would get \'-\' again (if the secret word doesn\'t have E at 5) or \'✓\' if by chance it is? But we already know it\'s not at 5, so putting E at position 5 again is wasteful.\n\n   So ideally, we put E at a new position (either 1,2,3,4) and similarly A at a new position (not 3).\n\n   For AGILE: \n        Position 1: A -> if we put A at 1, we might get:\n            If the secret word has A at 1: ✓\n            If not: then \'-\' meaning A is present but not at 1 (and also not at 3) so it would be in 2,4 or 5? But wait, if the secret word has A at 4, then we will get \'-\' for A at 1.\n        Position 5: E -> this is the same position as before, and we know E is not at 5, so we will get \'-\' for E again? So that doesn\'t tell us anything new about E.\n\n   So let\'s avoid putting E at position 5.\n\n   We can choose a word that puts E at positions 1,2,3,4 and A at 1,2,4,5 (but not 3 and also we avoid the same position if we can get new information).\n\n   Example words:\n\n     - Place A at position 1: e.g., ""ABIDE"" -> includes A at 1 and E at 5? But we don\'t want E at 5. Also, E at 5 is the same as before? So no.\n\n     - Place E at position 1: ""EARLY"" -> but has R? We cannot use R.\n\n     - ""LEAST"": but has T? Cannot use T.\n\n     - ""PASTE"": again, has S, T -> T is not allowed.\n\n     - ""DATE"": only 4 letters? Must be 5.\n\n     - Let me think: words without C,R,T and with A and E, and E not at 5.\n\n     Some candidates:\n\n        ""SNAKE"": \n            S, N, A, K, E -> includes S,N,A,K,E -> no R,T,C.\n            Positions: \n               S:1, N:2, A:3 -> but wait, the first guess ruled out A at position 3? So if we put A at 3 again, we will get \'-\' (since A is present but not at position 3). But we already know that? So it doesn\'t give new information? Ideally, we want to put A in a new position to test.\n\n        ""PLANE"":\n            P,L,A,N,E -> no C,R,T.\n            Positions: A at 3? Again, same as before.\n\n        We cannot put A at position 3? So we need a word that has A not at position 3 and also E not at position 5.\n\n        How about ""PLANE"" but rearrange? We can\'t rearrange arbitrarily, must be a valid word.\n\n        Let me list:\n\n          ""ADIEU"": has A and E, and vowels? But let\'s see:\n             A:1, D:2, I:3, E:4, U:5 -> note E is at position 4, not 5? and A is at 1. \n          But does it avoid C,R,T? Yes.\n\n          However, the first guess had A at 3 and E at 5. Now we have A at 1 and E at 4.\n\n          This seems good: because we are testing A at a different position and E at a different position.\n\n        Also, ""ADIEU"" is a common word used in Wordle as a starter? But we are not using it as starter. But okay.\n\n        What other words?\n\n        ""AISLE"": \n            A at 1, E at 5? But E at 5 we know is not correct? So that\'s inefficient.\n\n        ""ABASE"":\n            A at 1, B, A, S, E -> wait, duplicate A? Not necessarily bad, but we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s. However, we know A is present at least once. But our guess has two A\'s? So if the secret word has exactly one A, then one A might be marked ✓ or - and the other marked x? But that might give extra info? But let\'s avoid duplication for now?\n\n        ""ADIEU"" seems efficient because:\n          - It uses A and E (which we know are in the word)\n          - It places A at position 1 (which we haven\'t tested) and E at position 4 (which we haven\'t tested)\n          - And includes D, I, U which are new letters.\n\n        Also, it avoids C,R,T.\n\n        But note: in the feedback we got, A was marked as present but wrong position. What if the secret word has A at position 1? Then by guessing A at position 1, we\'ll get a ✓ for A? Similarly, if E is at position 4, we get ✓. Otherwise, we might get more \'-\' or even a ✓ if A is at 1 or E at 4.\n\n        So let\'s choose ""ADIEU"".\n\n        Another option: ""MEDIA"": \n            M,E,D,I,A -> positions: E at 2, A at 5 -> but A at 5: we haven\'t tested A at 5? And E at 2? That\'s good. Also, avoids C,R,T.\n\n        But ""ADIEU"" and ""MEDIA"" are both valid. \n\n        How about ""ANIME"": \n            A at 1, N, I, M, E -> E at 5? again.\n\n        So ""MEDIA"" puts E at 2 and A at 5? But note: in the first guess, we had E at 5? And we know E is not at position 5? So putting A at 5 and E at 2? That seems okay.\n\n        However, we know E is present but not at position 5. If we put E at 2 and get a \'-\', that tells us E is in the word but not at 2? Then we know it must be at 1,3 or 4? Similarly, for A we know it is not at 3. So if we put A at 5, and we get \'-\', that tells us A is not at 5? Then A must be at 1,2, or 4? But we don\'t have a test for A at 1? We did test A at 3 and now at 5? So not covering position 1 or 2.\n\n        Alternatively, with ""ADIEU"": \n          Positions for A: 1 -> test position 1\n          Positions for E: 4 -> test position 4\n\n        So if we get:\n          A at 1: ✓ or \'-\'? \n          E at 4: ✓ or \'-\'?\n\n        That would be more informative because we are testing two new positions.\n\n        Also, in ""MEDIA"", E at 2 and A at 5? We test E at 2 and A at 5? But we already know E cannot be at 5? And we don\'t have a test for A at 1? So ""ADIEU"" seems better.\n\n        However, note: what if the secret word has A and E? And we are testing A at 1 and E at 4? That might get us two ✓ if they are correctly placed? Otherwise, if not, we get information.\n\n        I\'ll go with ""ADIEU"".\n\n        So the second guess: ADIEU\n\n        But note: ""ADIEU"" is a valid English word? Yes, it means goodbye.\n\n        Also, it has the following letters: A, D, I, E, U. None of the absent letters.\n\n        So let\'s use that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"", I analyzed the following:\n- C, R, and T are **NOT** in the secret word (marked ✗).\n- A and E are in the word but NOT in positions 3 and 5 respectively (marked -).\n- Therefore, the secret word contains A and E but excludes C, R, T.\n\nFor the second guess, I prioritized:\n1. **Including A and E** while avoiding C, R, T.\n2. **Testing new positions**: A should not be in position 3 (already tested), and E should not be in position 5 (already tested). I chose positions that maximize new information: A in position 1 and E in position 4.\n3. **Covering new common letters**: S, L, N, P, D, I, etc., to gather more clues.\n4. **Avoiding reused positions** for known letters to learn about their correct placements.\n\n""ADIEU"" is a strong choice because:\n- Contains A (position 1) and E (position 4), both in new untested positions.\n- Avoids C, R, T; introduces new letters: D, I, U.\n- Tests vowel-heavy combinations efficiently, helping narrow down possibilities.\n\n<guess>ADIEU</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: ADIEU -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) I(x) E(✓) U(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRATE\n  C: x (absent)\n  R: x (absent)\n  A: - (present, but wrong position; not position 3)\n  T: x (absent)\n  E: - (present, but wrong position; not position 5)\n\nGuess 2: ADIEU\n  A: ✓ (correct position, so A is at position 1)\n  D: x (absent)\n  I: x (absent)\n  E: ✓ (correct position, so E is at position 4)\n  U: x (absent)\n\nNow, we know:\n- The secret word has A at position 1 and E at position 4.\n- The secret word does not contain: C, R, T, D, I, U.\n- We have two known letters: A (pos1) and E (pos4).\n\nThe word structure is: A _ _ E _\n\nWe need to fill the middle three positions (positions 2, 3, and 5) with letters that are not in the excluded list (C, R, T, D, I, U) and are English letters.\n\nAlso, note that from the first guess, we know that A is not at position 3 (which we already know because now A is at 1) and E is not at position 5 (which we already know because E is at 4). So no new constraints from that.\n\nNow, we must choose a word that starts with A, ends with E in the fourth position?

We haven\'t tested B.\n\nBut we must avoid: C, R, T, D, I, U. B is not in that list, so it\'s allowed.\n\nBut is ABBEY a valid word? Yes.\n\nBut let\'s see if there are more common words.\n\nAnother: ABLE? But ABLE is 4 letters. We need 5. So not.\n\n- AGILE? But I is excluded.\n\n- ALONE: A, L, O, N, E -> but E is at position 5? We need E at position 4. So pattern: A _ _ E _ -> so the fourth letter must be E. In ALONE, the fourth letter is N? So not.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be E. So the word must be: A _ _ E _\n\nSo the third letter is the one before E? So the word has the form: A X Y E Z, where X, Y, Z are letters to be chosen.\n\nNow, we need English words of that form.\n\nSome examples:\n\n- APPLE: A, P, P, L, E -> but wait, the fourth letter is L? Then E is at fifth? But we need E at fourth? So no.\n\n- AMPLE: A, M, P, L, E -> again, E at fifth? Not at fourth.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be E. So the word must have E as the fourth letter.\n\nFor example: \n  A _ _ E A -> but then the last letter is A? But we already have A at first? And we don\'t know if A can be repeated? The feedback didn\'t show any duplicate, but it\'s possible.\n\nBut let\'s see: the first guess had no duplicate, and second guess had no duplicate. But the secret word might have duplicates? We don\'t know.\n\nBut to be safe, we can consider both cases.\n\nHowever, let\'s list words that have E at position 4.\n\nCommon words:\n\n- AZURE: A, Z, U, R, E -> but U and R are excluded? R is excluded from first guess? Yes, R is absent. So not.\n\n- AWAKE: A, W, A, K, E -> but E is at fifth? Not fourth.\n\n- ABASE: A, B, A, S, E -> E at fifth? Not fourth.\n\n- ABATE: A, B, A, T, E -> T is excluded, and E at fifth.\n\n- AGATE: A, G, A, T, E -> T excluded.\n\n- ALATE: not common, and T excluded.\n\n- AMAZE: A, M, A, Z, E -> E at fifth.\n\nIt seems difficult? Maybe I\'m missing.\n\nWhat about: A _ _ E _ \n\nLet me think of words that end with ""E"" in the fourth position? Actually, the fifth letter is after E? So the word ends with E? No, the fourth is E, then fifth is another letter.\n\nSo the word has the form: A??E?\n\nExamples:\n\n- AXLE: A, X, L, E, ? -> but AXLE is 4 letters? We need 5.\n\n5-letter words:\n\n- ANKLE: A, N, K, L, E -> but E is at fifth? Not fourth.\n\n- APPLE: A, P, P, L, E -> E at fifth.\n\n- ABUSE: A, B, U, S, E -> U is excluded? From second guess, U is absent. So not.\n\n- AMUSE: A, M, U, S, E -> U excluded.\n\n- AWAKE: A, W, A, K, E -> E at fifth.\n\nWait, I think I have a mistake: the pattern is A _ _ E _ meaning:\n\nPosition 1: A\nPosition 2: ?\nPosition 3: ?\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: ?\n\nSo the word ends with E? No, position 4 is E, so position 5 is the last letter and can be anything.\n\nFor example, ""ABASE"" is A, B, A, S, E -> positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:A, 4:S, 5:E -> so the fourth letter is S, not E. So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be E. So the word must have the fourth character as E.\n\nFor example, ""AGLEE""? Not a word.\n\n""ALLEE"": A, L, L, E, E -> that\'s a word? It means a tree-lined path. But it has duplicate L and E? And E at position 4 and 5.\n\nBut let\'s see: A _ _ E _ -> so position 4 is E, and position 5 is the last letter.\n\nIn ""ALLEE"": \n  Position 1: A\n  Position 2: L\n  Position 3: L\n  Position 4: E\n  Position 5: E\n\nSo it fits the pattern.\n\nBut we have to check if the letters are allowed: L is not excluded, E is already known. But we have two E\'s? The secret word might have two E\'s? We don\'t know.\n\nBut in our feedback, we only know one E (at position 4) but there could be more.\n\nSimilarly, A is at position 1 and we don\'t know if there is another A.\n\nBut in this case, ""ALLEE"" has two E\'s and one A.\n\nBut we must avoid excluded letters: C, R, T, D, I, U. L is not excluded, so it\'s okay.\n\nBut is ""ALLEE"" common? Maybe not.\n\nAnother word: ""AGAPE"": A, G, A, P, E -> positions: 1:A, 2:G, 3:A, 4:P, 5:E -> fourth letter is P, not E.\n\n""AMIDE"": A, M, I, D, E -> but I and D are excluded? From second guess, D and I are absent. So not.\n\n""ANODE"": A, N, O, D, E -> D is excluded.\n\n""ABODE"": A, B, O, D, E -> D excluded.\n\n""ALIKE"": A, L, I, K, E -> I excluded.\n\nIt\'s challenging. Let me think of words that have E at position 4.\n\nAnother: ""AWARE"": A, W, A, R, E -> R is excluded.\n\n""AZURE"": A, Z, U, R, E -> U and R excluded.\n\n""OPERA"": but doesn\'t start with A.\n\nWe need to start with A.\n\n""ARISE"": A, R, I, S, E -> R and I excluded.\n\n""ABASE"": doesn\'t have E at 4.\n\nPerhaps: ""AEGIS"" -> A, E, G, I, S -> but E is at position 2, not 4.\n\nI think I need to search for words that start with A and have E as the fourth letter.\n\nSome possibilities:\n\n- ACNES: A, C, N, E, S -> but C is excluded? From first guess, C is absent. So not.\n\n- ADZES: A, D, Z, E, S -> D is excluded.\n\n- AGUES: A, G, U, E, S -> U excluded.\n\n- ALMES: A, L, M, E, S -> this might work? ""ALMES"" is not a common word? It might be obsolete.\n\n- ALECS: A, L, E, C, S -> but E is at position 3? Not 4.\n\n- ALKYD: A, L, K, Y, D -> D excluded and no E at 4.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the secret word might have the letter E at position 4, and then the fifth letter is part of the word.\n\nAnother idea: ""APPEL"": A, P, P, E, L -> positions: 1:A, 2:P, 3:P, 4:E, 5:L -> yes! Fourth letter is E.\n\nAnd ""APPEL"" is a valid word (a term in law or fencing).\n\nNow, check the letters: A, P, P, E, L.\n\nWe know A and E are in the word (and we are placing A at 1 and E at 4, which is correct).\n\nP and L are new letters, not excluded.\n\nAlso, no excluded letters: C, R, T, D, I, U are not in this word.\n\nSo ""APPEL"" is a candidate.\n\nOther words:\n\n- ARMER: but R excluded.\n\n- ASTER: A, S, T, E, R -> T and R excluded.\n\n- AVERT: A, V, E, R, T -> R and T excluded.\n\n- ""ASKEW"": A, S, K, E, W -> fourth letter is E? Positions: 1:A, 2:S, 3:K, 4:E, 5:W -> yes.\n\n""ASKEW"" is a common word.\n\nLetters: A, S, K, E, W.\n\nExcluded letters: none of these are in the excluded list (C,R,T,D,I,U).\n\nSo ""ASKEW"" is also a candidate.\n\nAnother: ""ASPEN"": A, S, P, E, N -> fourth letter is E? 1:A,2:S,3:P,4:E,5:N -> yes, but E is at position 4? No: in ""ASPEN"", the letters are A,S,P,E,N so position 4 is E? Let\'s count:\n\nPosition 1: A\nPosition 2: S\nPosition 3: P\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: N\n\nYes, so ""ASPEN"" has E at position 4.\n\nBut ""ASPEN"" is a proper noun? It\'s a tree, so it\'s acceptable.\n\nBut in Wordle, proper nouns are not used? Actually, Wordle uses common words, and ""ASPEN"" is a common noun.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have two good candidates: ""APPEL"" and ""ASKEW"" and ""ASPEN"".\n\nWe can choose one that uses more common letters to get information.\n\nWe know the first letter is A and fourth is E, so we are really guessing positions 2,3,5.\n\nIn ""APPEL"": positions 2:P, 3:P, 5:L\nIn ""ASKEW"": positions 2:S, 3:K, 5:W\nIn ""ASPEN"": positions 2:S, 3:P, 5:N\n\nWe want to maximize information. Since we have no information about the middle letters, we can choose a word that has common letters.\n\nS is a very common letter, so ""ASKEW"" or ""ASPEN"" might be better.\n\nAlso, ""ASKEW"" has W which is less common, but it\'s okay.\n\nAnother common word: ""ASHEN"": A, S, H, E, N -> positions: 1:A,2:S,3:H,4:E,5:N -> yes.\n\n""ASHEN"" is a word.\n\nSo candidates: APPEL, ASKEW, ASPEN, ASHEN.\n\nWe can choose ""ASHEN"" because it has S, H, N which are common.\n\nBut we don\'t have any information about H or N.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has a letter we haven\'t tried, to see if it\'s present.\n\nBut since we are constrained by the pattern, we have to choose a word that fits.\n\nI think any of these are fine.\n\nLet me pick ""ASHEN"" because it has common letters.\n\nBut note: we are also trying to get feedback on the letters in positions 2,3,5.\n\nIf we guess ""ASHEN"", then:\n\n- A: already correct (position 1)\n- S: if it is in the word, we\'ll get feedback on its position (position 2)\n- H: similarly (position 3)\n- E: already correct (position 4)\n- N: similarly (position 5)\n\nBut we don\'t know if S, H, N are in the word.\n\nAlternatively, if we guess ""APPEL"", we are guessing P at 2 and 3, and L at 5. But if P is not in the word, then we get two x\'s for the P\'s? That might be inefficient.\n\nSo ""ASHEN"" or ""ASKEW"" might be better because they have distinct letters.\n\nBetween ""ASHEN"" and ""ASKEW"", ""ASHEN"" has more common letters.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency: S is very common, H is common, N is common.\n\nIn ""ASKEW"", S is common, K is common, W is less common.\n\nSo ""ASHEN"" might be better.\n\nAnother candidate: ""AXMEN"" -> not a word.\n\n""AMBER"": A, M, B, E, R -> but R is excluded.\n\n""ALBEE"": A, L, B, E, E -> has E at position 4 and 5? Positions: 1:A,2:L,3:B,4:E,5:E -> and E is at 4 and 5. But we know E is at 4, so if there is another E at 5, that\'s possible. But R is not in it? But we have to avoid R? ""ALBEE"" has no R, but it has B and L and E. But is it a word? It\'s a surname, but not common.\n\nStick to common words.\n\n""ASHEN"" seems good.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: ""ASHEN"" means of a pale grayish color.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""ASHEN"".\n\nBut wait, in ""ASHEN"", the fourth letter is E? Let\'s spell: A-S-H-E-N -> positions: 1:A, 2:S, 3:H, 4:E, 5:N. Yes.\n\nAnd no excluded letters.\n\nSo guess: ASHEN\n\nBut we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t have evidence, but it\'s possible.\n\nBut ""ASHEN"" has no duplicates.\n\nSo let\'s use that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: CRATE**  \n  Feedback: C(✗), R(✗), A(➖), T(✗), E(➖)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - A and E are in the secret word but not in positions 3 or 5.  \n  - C, R, and T are **absent** from the secret word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ADIEU**  \n  Feedback: A(✓), D(✗), I(✗), E(✓), U(✗)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - A is **correctly placed at position 1**.  \n  - E is **correctly placed at position 4**.  \n  - D, I, and U are **absent** from the secret word.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:  \n   - Position 1: **A** (fixed).  \n   - Position 4: **E** (fixed).  \n   - The secret word structure is: `A _ _ E _`.  \n   \n2. **Absent Letters**:  \n   - C, R, T (from Guess 1), and D, I, U (from Guess 2) are **not in the word**.  \n   - Avoid using these letters in future guesses.  \n\n3. **Unknown Positions**:  \n   - Positions 2, 3, and 5 are unknown.  \n   - We need to test new common letters (e.g., S, L, N, O, P, M, B, G, H, K) to gather more clues.  \n\n4. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  \n   - The word must start with `A` and have `E` at position 4: `A _ _ E _`.  \n   - Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, H, N, L, P) to maximize information.  \n   - Avoid reused positions for known letters (A and E are fixed, so focus on positions 2, 3, 5).  \n   - Ideal words should test high-frequency consonants/vowels in new positions.  \n\n### Why ""ASHEN""?\n- **Fits the Pattern**: `A _ _ E _` → A (pos1), S (pos2), H (pos3), E (pos4), N (pos5).  \n- **Tests New Common Letters**:  \n  - **S** (high-frequency), **H** (common), **N** (common) — all untested and not excluded.  \n- **Avoids Absent Letters**: No C, R, T, D, I, or U.  \n- **Information Gain**:  \n  - If S, H, or N are in the secret word, feedback will reveal their positions/absence.  \n  - If incorrect, we eliminate three common letters, narrowing possibilities significantly.  \n- **Common Word**: ""ASHEN"" is a valid English word (meaning pale or grayish), fitting Wordle\'s dictionary.  \n\n### Other Candidates Considered:\n- **ASKEW**: `A S K E W` (tests S, K, W). Chose ""ASHEN"" over this because H and N are more frequent than K and W.  \n- **ASPEN**: `A S P E N` (tests S, P, N). Similar to ""ASHEN"", but ""ASHEN"" includes H (slightly more common than P).  \n- **APPEL**: `A P P E L` (tests P, L). Less ideal due to duplicate P, which reduces information if P is absent.\n\n<guess>ASHEN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: ADIEU -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) I(x) E(✓) U(x)\nGuess 3: ASHEN -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) S(x) H(x) E(✓) N(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from Guess 3: ASHEN -> A(✓), S(x), H(x), E(✓), N(x)
 This means:
   - A is correct and in position 1 (already known).
   - E is correct and in position 4 (already known).
   - S, H, and N are not in the word (absent). They are now added to the list of excluded letters.

 Now, we know the secret word has:
   - First letter: A
   - Fourth letter: E
   And the word structure is: A _ _ E _

 We also know the excluded letters: C, R, T, D, I, U, S, H, N (from previous feedback).

 The remaining positions are 2, 3, and 5.

 We need to fill these positions with letters that are not excluded and form a valid English word.

 We now know the word has the form: A _ _ E _

 Excluded letters: C, D, H, I, N, R, S, T, U.

 Available letters: all others in the alphabet, e.g., B, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we have three positions and limited guesses, we want to guess a word that:
   - Fits the structure A _ _ E _
   - Uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.
   - Avoids the excluded letters.

 We can think of common words that start with A, have E as the fourth letter and do not contain any of the excluded letters.

 Let's consider possible letters for positions 2, 3, and 5.

 Position 2: we have no information, so we can try a common letter like L, M, P, etc.
 Position 3: same, common letter.
 Position 5: common letters.

 Some word ideas:

   - ""APPLE"": but has P and L? But wait, ""APPLE"" has P and L, but also note:
        A, P, P, L, E -> but E is at position 5, not 4. And we need E at 4? In ""APPLE"", the fourth letter is L? So not.

   We require the fourth letter to be E. So the word must have E at index 3 (if 0-indexed) or index 4 (1-indexed).

   Let me think of words: A _ _ E _

   Examples:

     - ""AMBLE"": A, M, B, L, E -> structure: A, M, B, L, E -> but E is at position 5? Not at 4. The fourth letter is L? So no.

     - ""AMPLE"": A, M, P, L, E -> same, E at fifth.

     - ""ALLEE"": A, L, L, E, E -> this works? 
          Position 1: A
          Position 2: L
          Position 3: L
          Position 4: E
          Position 5: E
        But E is doubled? And we know E at position 4 is correct. The secret word might have another E? Also, check excluded letters: L is not excluded? So ""ALLEE"" might be a candidate? But it's not a very common word.

     - ""AGLEE"": A, G, L, E, E? Not a word.

     - ""AWAKE"": A, W, A, K, E -> structure: A(1), W(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) -> fourth is K? Not E.

     - ""ABATE"": A, B, A, T, E -> T is excluded? Yes, T is absent. So invalid.

     - ""ABAKE"": not a word.

   After more thought, some valid words:

     - ""APPEL"": A, P, P, E, L -> 
          Position 1: A
          Position 2: P
          Position 3: P
          Position 4: E
          Position 5: L
        This fits the pattern. Also, letters: P, P, L - which are not excluded (assuming P and L are allowed).

     - ""ASKEW"": A, S, K, E, W -> but S is excluded now? From Guess 3, S is absent. So we cannot use S.

     - ""ASPEN"": A, S, P, E, N -> S and N are excluded? Yes, from Guess 3.

     - ""ASHED"": A, S, H, E, D -> S, H, D are excluded? So no.

   So ""APPEL"" is a candidate: A, P, P, E, L -> but L is at position 5? And no excluded letters? 
        Excluded: C, D, H, I, N, R, S, T, U -> P and L are not in that list.

   But note: we have two P's? If the secret word has only one P, then one of them might be marked absent? But that's okay because we are testing.

   Another candidate: ""AMBER"" -> A, M, B, E, R -> but R is excluded? R is absent. So no.

   ""ABBES"": A, B, B, E, S -> S is excluded? And E at fourth? 
        Positions: A(1), B(2), B(3), E(4), S(5) -> but S is excluded.

   ""AKEES"": not common.

   ""ALLEE"": already discussed.

   ""AMPLE"": A, M, P, L, E -> but fourth is L? So the E is at the end? Not at position 4.

   We must have E at position 4.

   Another: ""ABBEY"": A, B, B, E, Y -> 
        Position 1: A
        Position 2: B
        Position 3: B
        Position 4: E
        Position 5: Y
        This fits! And letters: B, B, Y -> B and Y are not excluded? 
          Excluded letters: C,D,H,I,N,R,S,T,U -> B and Y are allowed.

   So ""ABBEY"" is a candidate.

   Also: ""AGLEY"": not common.

   ""ALLEY"": A, L, L, E, Y -> but the fourth letter is E? 
        Positions: A(1), L(2), L(3), E(4), Y(5) -> yes! And L and Y are not excluded.

   ""ALLEY"" is a common word.

   So we have:
        APPEL: uses P and L
        ABBEY: uses B and Y
        ALLEY: uses L and Y

   But note: ""APPEL"" has two P's? If the secret word has only one P, we might get feedback: the second P might be marked differently? But we can still get information.

   However, ""ALLEY"" has two L's? Similarly.

   Since we have limited options, let's choose the most common word.

   ""ALLEY"" is more common than ""APPEL"" and ""ABBEY""? 

   Actually, ""ALLEY"" is very common.

   But let's see what letters they use.

   We don't have information about P, L, B, Y, etc.

   We can pick ""ALLEY"" because it tests L and Y.

   Also, note: in the word ""ALLEY"", we have:
        Position 2: L -> we are testing L at position 2.
        Position 3: L -> also L at position 3? But if the secret word has only one L, then one might be marked differently? We'll get information.

   Another option: ""AGAPE"" -> A, G, A, P, E -> but fourth letter is P? So E is at fifth? No.

   Actually, we can list:

   - ""ABBEY"": tests B (twice) and Y? Actually, two B's and one Y.
   - ""ALLEY"": tests L (twice) and Y.
   - ""APPEL"": tests P (twice) and L.

   Since ""ALLEY"" is a common word, I choose that.

   But wait: what about ""AMBER""? That has excluded letters? R excluded.

   ""ANKLE"" -> N excluded, and E at fifth.

   So ""ALLEY"" seems a good choice.

   However, note: the secret word might not have two L's? But ""ALLEY"" does. But if the secret word has only one L, then the feedback might show one L as '-' (if present) and the other as 'x'? Or if L is present only once, then depending on the position, one L might be '-' and the other 'x'? Actually, because of the positions.

   But we don't know. We'll get information.

   Alternatively, can we find a word without duplicates? 

   For example, other words: 

     - ""ABASE"": A, B, A, S, E -> S excluded? And E at fifth? No.

     - ""AGAPE"": A, G, A, P, E -> structure: A(1), G(2), A(3), P(4), E(5) -> but we need E at position 4? So P is at 4? Not E.

     - ""AVIZE"": not common.

     - ""ABIDE"": A, B, I, D, E -> I and D excluded.

     - ""ALIVE"": A, L, I, V, E -> I excluded.

     - ""ABOVE"": A, B, O, V, E -> but E at fifth? No.

   Another possibility: ""ADOZE"": not common.

   ""AGONE"": A, G, O, N, E -> N excluded? And E at fifth? No.

   ""ALATE"": T excluded.

   So it seems difficult to find a word without duplicates? 

   But some words: 

     - ""AJPES"": not a word.

     - ""ALEEM"": not common.

     - ""ARGLE"": R excluded.

     I can't find many.

   What about ""AWARE"": A, W, A, R, E -> R excluded? And structure: fourth is R? Not E.

   Actually, another word: ""AUREI"": A, U, R, E, I -> U, R, I excluded? So no.

   Another: ""ADDLE"": A, D, D, L, E -> D excluded? Yes.

   ""ADOBE"": A, D, O, B, E -> D excluded.

   ""AGENE"": N excluded.

   So we might need to go with words that have E at position 4 and possibly duplicates? 

   We have ""ABBEY"", ""ALLEY"", and ""APPEL"". Also ""ABBEY"" has two B's, ""ALLEY"" has two L's, ""APPEL"" has two P's.

   Among these, ""ALLEY"" is the most common.

   Or ""AGREE"": A, G, R, E, E -> R excluded? R is excluded? And G,R,E -> R is excluded? So no.

   Another: ""AFFIX"": A, F, F, I, X -> I excluded.

   ""ALKYL"": K and Y -> but the fourth letter is Y? Not E.

   So let's use ""ALLEY"".

   We'll guess ""ALLEY"".

   Also, note: if the secret word is ""ALLEY"", we get it. Otherwise, we get feedback.

   We have only 3 guesses left? We started with 6, and this is the fourth guess.

   So we can afford.

   Let me also check: ""APPLE"" is not a candidate because E is at fifth.

   Thus, we choose ""ALLEY"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 3: ASHEN**  
  Feedback: A(✓), S(✗), H(✗), E(✓), N(✗)  
  Interpretation:  
  - A (position 1) and E (position 4) are **confirmed** and fixed.  
  - S, H, and N are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - Updated excluded letters: **C, D, H, I, N, R, S, T, U**.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Word Structure**:  
   - Secret word format: `A _ _ E _` (positions 1=A, 4=E).  
   - Positions 2, 3, and 5 are unknown.  

2. **Confirmed Constraints**:  
   - Excluded letters: **C, D, H, I, N, R, S, T, U** cannot appear anywhere.  
   - Must use only untested letters (e.g., B, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).  

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Prioritize common letters not excluded (e.g., **L, Y, B, P, M**) to test positions 2, 3, and 5.  
   - Choose a word that maximizes information on potential letter placements.  
   - Ideal candidates: Words fitting `A _ _ E _` without excluded letters.  

### Why ""ALLEY""?
- **Fits Pattern**: `A L L E Y` → A (1), L (2), L (3), E (4), Y (5).  
- **Tests New Common Letters**:  
  - **L** (high-frequency consonant) and **Y** (common vowel substitute) are untested.  
- **Avoids Excluded Letters**: No matches with banned list.  
- **Information Gain**:  
  - If L is in the word, feedback reveals correct/incorrect positions (positions 2 and 3).  
  - If Y is in the word, feedback shows if position 5 is correct.  
- **Valid English Word**: ""ALLEY"" is common (noun: a narrow street).  

### Other Candidates Considered and Rejected:
- **APPEL** (`A P P E L`): Uses P and L, but duplicate P reduces information efficiency.  
- **ABBEY** (`A B B E Y`): Uses B and Y, but duplicates B; slightly less common than ""ALLEY"".  
- **AMPLE** (`A M P L E`): Incorrect format (position 4 must be E, not L).  
- **ASKEW** (`A S K E W`): Invalid due to excluded ""S"".  

<guess>ALLEY</guess>",ALLEY,"We have feedback from Guess 3: ASHEN -> A(✓), S(x), H(x), E(✓), N(x)
 This means:
   - A is correct and in position 1 (already known).
   - E is correct and in position 4 (already known).
   - S, H, and N are not in the word (absent). They are now added to the list of excluded letters.

 Now, we know the secret word has:
   - First letter: A
   - Fourth letter: E
   And the word structure is: A _ _ E _

 We also know the excluded letters: C, R, T, D, I, U, S, H, N (from previous feedback).

 The remaining positions are 2, 3, and 5.

 We need to fill these positions with letters that are not excluded and form a valid English word.

 We now know the word has the form: A _ _ E _

 Excluded letters: C, D, H, I, N, R, S, T, U.

 Available letters: all others in the alphabet, e.g., B, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we have three positions and limited guesses, we want to guess a word that:
   - Fits the structure A _ _ E _
   - Uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.
   - Avoids the excluded letters.

 We can think of common words that start with A, have E as the fourth letter and do not contain any of the excluded letters.

 Let's consider possible letters for positions 2, 3, and 5.

 Position 2: we have no information, so we can try a common letter like L, M, P, etc.
 Position 3: same, common letter.
 Position 5: common letters.

 Some word ideas:

   - ""APPLE"": but has P and L? But wait, ""APPLE"" has P and L, but also note:
        A, P, P, L, E -> but E is at position 5, not 4. And we need E at 4? In ""APPLE"", the fourth letter is L? So not.

   We require the fourth letter to be E. So the word must have E at index 3 (if 0-indexed) or index 4 (1-indexed).

   Let me think of words: A _ _ E _

   Examples:

     - ""AMBLE"": A, M, B, L, E -> structure: A, M, B, L, E -> but E is at position 5? Not at 4. The fourth letter is L? So no.

     - ""AMPLE"": A, M, P, L, E -> same, E at fifth.

     - ""ALLEE"": A, L, L, E, E -> this works? 
          Position 1: A
          Position 2: L
          Position 3: L
          Position 4: E
          Position 5: E
        But E is doubled? And we know E at position 4 is correct. The secret word might have another E? Also, check excluded letters: L is not excluded? So ""ALLEE"" might be a candidate? But it's not a very common word.

     - ""AGLEE"": A, G, L, E, E? Not a word.

     - ""AWAKE"": A, W, A, K, E -> structure: A(1), W(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) -> fourth is K? Not E.

     - ""ABATE"": A, B, A, T, E -> T is excluded? Yes, T is absent. So invalid.

     - ""ABAKE"": not a word.

   After more thought, some valid words:

     - ""APPEL"": A, P, P, E, L -> 
          Position 1: A
          Position 2: P
          Position 3: P
          Position 4: E
          Position 5: L
        This fits the pattern. Also, letters: P, P, L - which are not excluded (assuming P and L are allowed).

     - ""ASKEW"": A, S, K, E, W -> but S is excluded now? From Guess 3, S is absent. So we cannot use S.

     - ""ASPEN"": A, S, P, E, N -> S and N are excluded? Yes, from Guess 3.

     - ""ASHED"": A, S, H, E, D -> S, H, D are excluded? So no.

   So ""APPEL"" is a candidate: A, P, P, E, L -> but L is at position 5? And no excluded letters? 
        Excluded: C, D, H, I, N, R, S, T, U -> P and L are not in that list.

   But note: we have two P's? If the secret word has only one P, then one of them might be marked absent? But that's okay because we are testing.

   Another candidate: ""AMBER"" -> A, M, B, E, R -> but R is excluded? R is absent. So no.

   ""ABBES"": A, B, B, E, S -> S is excluded? And E at fourth? 
        Positions: A(1), B(2), B(3), E(4), S(5) -> but S is excluded.

   ""AKEES"": not common.

   ""ALLEE"": already discussed.

   ""AMPLE"": A, M, P, L, E -> but fourth is L? So the E is at the end? Not at position 4.

   We must have E at position 4.

   Another: ""ABBEY"": A, B, B, E, Y -> 
        Position 1: A
        Position 2: B
        Position 3: B
        Position 4: E
        Position 5: Y
        This fits! And letters: B, B, Y -> B and Y are not excluded? 
          Excluded letters: C,D,H,I,N,R,S,T,U -> B and Y are allowed.

   So ""ABBEY"" is a candidate.

   Also: ""AGLEY"": not common.

   ""ALLEY"": A, L, L, E, Y -> but the fourth letter is E? 
        Positions: A(1), L(2), L(3), E(4), Y(5) -> yes! And L and Y are not excluded.

   ""ALLEY"" is a common word.

   So we have:
        APPEL: uses P and L
        ABBEY: uses B and Y
        ALLEY: uses L and Y

   But note: ""APPEL"" has two P's? If the secret word has only one P, we might get feedback: the second P might be marked differently? But we can still get information.

   However, ""ALLEY"" has two L's? Similarly.

   Since we have limited options, let's choose the most common word.

   ""ALLEY"" is more common than ""APPEL"" and ""ABBEY""? 

   Actually, ""ALLEY"" is very common.

   But let's see what letters they use.

   We don't have information about P, L, B, Y, etc.

   We can pick ""ALLEY"" because it tests L and Y.

   Also, note: in the word ""ALLEY"", we have:
        Position 2: L -> we are testing L at position 2.
        Position 3: L -> also L at position 3? But if the secret word has only one L, then one might be marked differently? We'll get information.

   Another option: ""AGAPE"" -> A, G, A, P, E -> but fourth letter is P? So E is at fifth? No.

   Actually, we can list:

   - ""ABBEY"": tests B (twice) and Y? Actually, two B's and one Y.
   - ""ALLEY"": tests L (twice) and Y.
   - ""APPEL"": tests P (twice) and L.

   Since ""ALLEY"" is a common word, I choose that.

   But wait: what about ""AMBER""? That has excluded letters? R excluded.

   ""ANKLE"" -> N excluded, and E at fifth.

   So ""ALLEY"" seems a good choice.

   However, note: the secret word might not have two L's? But ""ALLEY"" does. But if the secret word has only one L, then the feedback might show one L as '-' (if present) and the other as 'x'? Or if L is present only once, then depending on the position, one L might be '-' and the other 'x'? Actually, because of the positions.

   But we don't know. We'll get information.

   Alternatively, can we find a word without duplicates? 

   For example, other words: 

     - ""ABASE"": A, B, A, S, E -> S excluded? And E at fifth? No.

     - ""AGAPE"": A, G, A, P, E -> structure: A(1), G(2), A(3), P(4), E(5) -> but we need E at position 4? So P is at 4? Not E.

     - ""AVIZE"": not common.

     - ""ABIDE"": A, B, I, D, E -> I and D excluded.

     - ""ALIVE"": A, L, I, V, E -> I excluded.

     - ""ABOVE"": A, B, O, V, E -> but E at fifth? No.

   Another possibility: ""ADOZE"": not common.

   ""AGONE"": A, G, O, N, E -> N excluded? And E at fifth? No.

   ""ALATE"": T excluded.

   So it seems difficult to find a word without duplicates? 

   But some words: 

     - ""AJPES"": not a word.

     - ""ALEEM"": not common.

     - ""ARGLE"": R excluded.

     I can't find many.

   What about ""AWARE"": A, W, A, R, E -> R excluded? And structure: fourth is R? Not E.

   Actually, another word: ""AUREI"": A, U, R, E, I -> U, R, I excluded? So no.

   Another: ""ADDLE"": A, D, D, L, E -> D excluded? Yes.

   ""ADOBE"": A, D, O, B, E -> D excluded.

   ""AGENE"": N excluded.

   So we might need to go with words that have E at position 4 and possibly duplicates? 

   We have ""ABBEY"", ""ALLEY"", and ""APPEL"". Also ""ABBEY"" has two B's, ""ALLEY"" has two L's, ""APPEL"" has two P's.

   Among these, ""ALLEY"" is the most common.

   Or ""AGREE"": A, G, R, E, E -> R excluded? R is excluded? And G,R,E -> R is excluded? So no.

   Another: ""AFFIX"": A, F, F, I, X -> I excluded.

   ""ALKYL"": K and Y -> but the fourth letter is Y? Not E.

   So let's use ""ALLEY"".

   We'll guess ""ALLEY"".

   Also, note: if the secret word is ""ALLEY"", we get it. Otherwise, we get feedback.

   We have only 3 guesses left? We started with 6, and this is the fourth guess.

   So we can afford.

   Let me also check: ""APPLE"" is not a candidate because E is at fifth.

   Thus, we choose ""ALLEY"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior information. We need to pick a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have:
   - Common letters to maximize information.
   - Preferably no duplicate letters to cover more ground.

 Some common starting words in Wordle are: ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that uses common vowels and consonants to cover a broad set of letters.

 I am considering: ""CRATE""

 Why ""CRATE""?
   - It contains 'C', 'R', 'A', 'T', 'E'. These are common letters.
   - It includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 However, note that the word ""ROAST"" is also a good one because it has common letters and R and S are very common.

 Let me compare:
   - ""RAISE"" has R, A, I, S, E. It includes three vowels (A, I, E) which might be helpful.

 But since it's the first guess, we can choose any of these. 

 I'll go with ""RAISE"". It gives us three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This can help us quickly identify vowels in the word.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also popular.

 After consideration, I'll choose ""CRATE"" because it is frequently used and covers common letters.

 But note: The feedback we get will help us narrow down the next guess.

 Since the instructions don't specify any restriction, I'll use ""CRATE"".

 However, let me check: the example used BRISK. We don't want to bias too much.

 So my first guess: ""CRATE""

 We'll submit it and then get feedback for the next guess.I'm starting the game without any prior clues. For an optimal first guess, I should choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the potential feedback. The word should include frequent vowels and consonants while avoiding duplicate letters to cover more ground. 

""CRATE"" is a strong choice because:
- Contains common letters: C, R, A, T, E
- Includes two vowels (A, E) and three consonants
- Covers frequent letters found in English 5-letter words

This guess will likely provide helpful feedback on letter presence and positioning for subsequent guesses.

<guess>CRATE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess: CRATE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), T(x), E(-)
 This means:
   - A and E are in the secret word but not in the positions they were guessed (since they are marked as -).
   - C, R, T are not in the secret word at all (marked as x).

 Important: Since A and E are present but not in the guessed positions, we know:
   - The word contains A and E, but the A is not at position 3 (since in CRATE, A is the third letter) and E is not at position 5.

 Also, note that positions: 
   C (1st) -> absent
   R (2nd) -> absent
   A (3rd) -> present but wrong position
   T (4th) -> absent
   E (5th) -> present but wrong position

 Now, we have two confirmed letters: A and E.

 For the next guess, we need to:
   - Choose a 5-letter English word that includes A and E (since they are in the secret word).
   - Avoid using any of the absent letters: C, R, T (because they are not in the word at all). Also note that R was absent in the first guess, so R is not in the word? Wait, but the feedback for R was (x) meaning it is not in the word. Similarly for C and T.

 However, note: It's possible that a letter might appear more than once? But the rules don't specify. In Wordle, usually words can have repeated letters, but in this feedback, we must note:
   - The feedback symbol for each instance is independent. Since we only guessed one of each, and they were marked as absent, that means at least in those positions we don't have them. But if a letter is marked absent, it means that the total count of that letter in the secret word is less than the count we guessed? Actually, standard Wordle rules: if a letter is not in the word at all, it gets marked absent. If it is in the word but we have more copies than in the word, then the extra copies might be marked absent.

 Since we have only one instance of each in the guess, and they are marked absent, we can assume that the secret word does not contain C, R, or T.

 But wait: what about the letter R? We guessed R in position 2 and it was marked absent. Similarly, T in position 4 absent. So we know R and T are not in the word.

 Therefore, we must avoid letters C, R, T.

 Additionally, we know A and E are in the word, but not in positions 3 and 5.

 Now, let's think of a good next guess.

 We should look for words that:
   - Are 5 letters
   - Contain A and E
   - Exclude C, R, T
   - Also, we can try to use common letters to get more information.

 Since A and E are already confirmed, we can put them in different positions. Remember A cannot be at position 3 and E cannot be at position 5.

 We have three positions to fill: 1, 2, 4 (since position 3 must not be A and position 5 must not be E, but note: we might put A or E in one of the other positions? Actually, we can put A in 1,2,4 or 5? But we already know E cannot be at 5? However, we might put E in 1,2,3, or 4? Similarly, A in 1,2,4,5? But we don't know about position 1 and 2 and 4.

 We must also choose letters that are common and haven't been ruled out.

 Available letters: except C,R,T, and we know A and E are in the word.

 Let me think: we have 26 letters minus C,R,T -> 23 letters. But we might include other common letters.

 I am considering using a word with A and E and three new letters.

 A good strategy is to try to cover vowel possibilities and common consonants.

 Since we know A and E are present, we can focus on finding positions and including other common vowels/consonants.

 Common letters: S, L, N, O, I, D, H, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that includes A and E and three of these, avoiding C,R,T.

 Also, we must avoid placing A at position 3 and E at position 5.

 Some word ideas:

 - Option: ""LEMON"": but this has O and M? Wait, but it also has L,E,M,O,N -> but we are missing A? We must include A, because A is confirmed.

 So we need words that have A and E.

 Some words that contain A and E: ""LATHE"" -> but T is ruled out? No, T is absent so we cannot use T.

 Another: ""SLATE"" -> but has T, which is ruled out? And also R? No, SLATE has T? We cannot use T.

 Words without C,R,T and with A and E:

   ""AGILE"": contains A, G, I, L, E? -> Yes. But note positions:
      Position 1: A -> however, we don't know if A can be at position 1? Our feedback didn't rule that out.
      Position 5: E -> but in the first guess, E was at position 5 and we know it's not there? So putting E at position 5 would be bad? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? But we can put E elsewhere.

   In ""AGILE"":
      A at 1, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is the same as before? We know E is not at 5, so if we put E at 5, we are going to get a '-' because E is in the word but wrong position? Actually, we are not sure: the feedback for E at position 5 was '-', meaning that E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we guess E again at position 5, we would get '-' again (if the secret word doesn't have E at 5) or '✓' if by chance it is? But we already know it's not at 5, so putting E at position 5 again is wasteful.

   So ideally, we put E at a new position (either 1,2,3,4) and similarly A at a new position (not 3).

   For AGILE: 
        Position 1: A -> if we put A at 1, we might get:
            If the secret word has A at 1: ✓
            If not: then '-' meaning A is present but not at 1 (and also not at 3) so it would be in 2,4 or 5? But wait, if the secret word has A at 4, then we will get '-' for A at 1.
        Position 5: E -> this is the same position as before, and we know E is not at 5, so we will get '-' for E again? So that doesn't tell us anything new about E.

   So let's avoid putting E at position 5.

   We can choose a word that puts E at positions 1,2,3,4 and A at 1,2,4,5 (but not 3 and also we avoid the same position if we can get new information).

   Example words:

     - Place A at position 1: e.g., ""ABIDE"" -> includes A at 1 and E at 5? But we don't want E at 5. Also, E at 5 is the same as before? So no.

     - Place E at position 1: ""EARLY"" -> but has R? We cannot use R.

     - ""LEAST"": but has T? Cannot use T.

     - ""PASTE"": again, has S, T -> T is not allowed.

     - ""DATE"": only 4 letters? Must be 5.

     - Let me think: words without C,R,T and with A and E, and E not at 5.

     Some candidates:

        ""SNAKE"": 
            S, N, A, K, E -> includes S,N,A,K,E -> no R,T,C.
            Positions: 
               S:1, N:2, A:3 -> but wait, the first guess ruled out A at position 3? So if we put A at 3 again, we will get '-' (since A is present but not at position 3). But we already know that? So it doesn't give new information? Ideally, we want to put A in a new position to test.

        ""PLANE"":
            P,L,A,N,E -> no C,R,T.
            Positions: A at 3? Again, same as before.

        We cannot put A at position 3? So we need a word that has A not at position 3 and also E not at position 5.

        How about ""PLANE"" but rearrange? We can't rearrange arbitrarily, must be a valid word.

        Let me list:

          ""ADIEU"": has A and E, and vowels? But let's see:
             A:1, D:2, I:3, E:4, U:5 -> note E is at position 4, not 5? and A is at 1. 
          But does it avoid C,R,T? Yes.

          However, the first guess had A at 3 and E at 5. Now we have A at 1 and E at 4.

          This seems good: because we are testing A at a different position and E at a different position.

        Also, ""ADIEU"" is a common word used in Wordle as a starter? But we are not using it as starter. But okay.

        What other words?

        ""AISLE"": 
            A at 1, E at 5? But E at 5 we know is not correct? So that's inefficient.

        ""ABASE"":
            A at 1, B, A, S, E -> wait, duplicate A? Not necessarily bad, but we don't know if the secret word has two A's. However, we know A is present at least once. But our guess has two A's? So if the secret word has exactly one A, then one A might be marked ✓ or - and the other marked x? But that might give extra info? But let's avoid duplication for now?

        ""ADIEU"" seems efficient because:
          - It uses A and E (which we know are in the word)
          - It places A at position 1 (which we haven't tested) and E at position 4 (which we haven't tested)
          - And includes D, I, U which are new letters.

        Also, it avoids C,R,T.

        But note: in the feedback we got, A was marked as present but wrong position. What if the secret word has A at position 1? Then by guessing A at position 1, we'll get a ✓ for A? Similarly, if E is at position 4, we get ✓. Otherwise, we might get more '-' or even a ✓ if A is at 1 or E at 4.

        So let's choose ""ADIEU"".

        Another option: ""MEDIA"": 
            M,E,D,I,A -> positions: E at 2, A at 5 -> but A at 5: we haven't tested A at 5? And E at 2? That's good. Also, avoids C,R,T.

        But ""ADIEU"" and ""MEDIA"" are both valid. 

        How about ""ANIME"": 
            A at 1, N, I, M, E -> E at 5? again.

        So ""MEDIA"" puts E at 2 and A at 5? But note: in the first guess, we had E at 5? And we know E is not at position 5? So putting A at 5 and E at 2? That seems okay.

        However, we know E is present but not at position 5. If we put E at 2 and get a '-', that tells us E is in the word but not at 2? Then we know it must be at 1,3 or 4? Similarly, for A we know it is not at 3. So if we put A at 5, and we get '-', that tells us A is not at 5? Then A must be at 1,2, or 4? But we don't have a test for A at 1? We did test A at 3 and now at 5? So not covering position 1 or 2.

        Alternatively, with ""ADIEU"": 
          Positions for A: 1 -> test position 1
          Positions for E: 4 -> test position 4

        So if we get:
          A at 1: ✓ or '-'? 
          E at 4: ✓ or '-'?

        That would be more informative because we are testing two new positions.

        Also, in ""MEDIA"", E at 2 and A at 5? We test E at 2 and A at 5? But we already know E cannot be at 5? And we don't have a test for A at 1? So ""ADIEU"" seems better.

        However, note: what if the secret word has A and E? And we are testing A at 1 and E at 4? That might get us two ✓ if they are correctly placed? Otherwise, if not, we get information.

        I'll go with ""ADIEU"".

        So the second guess: ADIEU

        But note: ""ADIEU"" is a valid English word? Yes, it means goodbye.

        Also, it has the following letters: A, D, I, E, U. None of the absent letters.

        So let's use that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"", I analyzed the following:
- C, R, and T are **NOT** in the secret word (marked ✗).
- A and E are in the word but NOT in positions 3 and 5 respectively (marked -).
- Therefore, the secret word contains A and E but excludes C, R, T.

For the second guess, I prioritized:
1. **Including A and E** while avoiding C, R, T.
2. **Testing new positions**: A should not be in position 3 (already tested), and E should not be in position 5 (already tested). I chose positions that maximize new information: A in position 1 and E in position 4.
3. **Covering new common letters**: S, L, N, P, D, I, etc., to gather more clues.
4. **Avoiding reused positions** for known letters to learn about their correct placements.

""ADIEU"" is a strong choice because:
- Contains A (position 1) and E (position 4), both in new untested positions.
- Avoids C, R, T; introduces new letters: D, I, U.
- Tests vowel-heavy combinations efficiently, helping narrow down possibilities.

<guess>ADIEU</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ADIEU -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) I(x) E(✓) U(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRATE
  C: x (absent)
  R: x (absent)
  A: - (present, but wrong position; not position 3)
  T: x (absent)
  E: - (present, but wrong position; not position 5)

Guess 2: ADIEU
  A: ✓ (correct position, so A is at position 1)
  D: x (absent)
  I: x (absent)
  E: ✓ (correct position, so E is at position 4)
  U: x (absent)

Now, we know:
- The secret word has A at position 1 and E at position 4.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, T, D, I, U.
- We have two known letters: A (pos1) and E (pos4).

The word structure is: A _ _ E _

We need to fill the middle three positions (positions 2, 3, and 5) with letters that are not in the excluded list (C, R, T, D, I, U) and are English letters.

Also, note that from the first guess, we know that A is not at position 3 (which we already know because now A is at 1) and E is not at position 5 (which we already know because E is at 4). So no new constraints from that.

Now, we must choose a word that starts with A, ends with E in the fourth position? Actually, the word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5.

So the pattern is: A _ _ E _

But note: the E is at position 4, so the last letter (position 5) is still unknown.

We know the secret word has A at 1 and E at 4, so the word is: A _ _ E ?

We need to find a word that fits: A _ _ E _ and the missing letters are not in {C, R, T, D, I, U}.

Also, we have not used many common letters yet. We can try to use other common consonants and vowels.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, L, N, O, P, M, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

We can form words like: ABLE, AGLE (not a word), AISLE (but I is excluded), etc.

Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid excluded letters.

Pattern: A _ _ E _

Possible words:

- ABBEY? -> 5 letters? ABBEY has two B's and ends with Y? But pattern: A, B, B, E, Y -> but E is at position 4? Then the fifth is Y? So ""ABB E Y"" -> but that's A, B, B, E, Y -> positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:B, 4:E, 5:Y -> but we need the fourth to be E? Yes. However, we have two B's? And we don't know if B is allowed? We haven't tested B.

But we must avoid: C, R, T, D, I, U. B is not in that list, so it's allowed.

But is ABBEY a valid word? Yes.

But let's see if there are more common words.

Another: ABLE? But ABLE is 4 letters. We need 5. So not.

- AGILE? But I is excluded.

- ALONE: A, L, O, N, E -> but E is at position 5? We need E at position 4. So pattern: A _ _ E _ -> so the fourth letter must be E. In ALONE, the fourth letter is N? So not.

We need the fourth letter to be E. So the word must be: A _ _ E _

So the third letter is the one before E? So the word has the form: A X Y E Z, where X, Y, Z are letters to be chosen.

Now, we need English words of that form.

Some examples:

- APPLE: A, P, P, L, E -> but wait, the fourth letter is L? Then E is at fifth? But we need E at fourth? So no.

- AMPLE: A, M, P, L, E -> again, E at fifth? Not at fourth.

We need the fourth letter to be E. So the word must have E as the fourth letter.

For example: 
  A _ _ E A -> but then the last letter is A? But we already have A at first? And we don't know if A can be repeated? The feedback didn't show any duplicate, but it's possible.

But let's see: the first guess had no duplicate, and second guess had no duplicate. But the secret word might have duplicates? We don't know.

But to be safe, we can consider both cases.

However, let's list words that have E at position 4.

Common words:

- AZURE: A, Z, U, R, E -> but U and R are excluded? R is excluded from first guess? Yes, R is absent. So not.

- AWAKE: A, W, A, K, E -> but E is at fifth? Not fourth.

- ABASE: A, B, A, S, E -> E at fifth? Not fourth.

- ABATE: A, B, A, T, E -> T is excluded, and E at fifth.

- AGATE: A, G, A, T, E -> T excluded.

- ALATE: not common, and T excluded.

- AMAZE: A, M, A, Z, E -> E at fifth.

It seems difficult? Maybe I'm missing.

What about: A _ _ E _ 

Let me think of words that end with ""E"" in the fourth position? Actually, the fifth letter is after E? So the word ends with E? No, the fourth is E, then fifth is another letter.

So the word has the form: A??E?

Examples:

- AXLE: A, X, L, E, ? -> but AXLE is 4 letters? We need 5.

5-letter words:

- ANKLE: A, N, K, L, E -> but E is at fifth? Not fourth.

- APPLE: A, P, P, L, E -> E at fifth.

- ABUSE: A, B, U, S, E -> U is excluded? From second guess, U is absent. So not.

- AMUSE: A, M, U, S, E -> U excluded.

- AWAKE: A, W, A, K, E -> E at fifth.

Wait, I think I have a mistake: the pattern is A _ _ E _ meaning:

Position 1: A
Position 2: ?
Position 3: ?
Position 4: E
Position 5: ?

So the word ends with E? No, position 4 is E, so position 5 is the last letter and can be anything.

For example, ""ABASE"" is A, B, A, S, E -> positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:A, 4:S, 5:E -> so the fourth letter is S, not E. So that doesn't work.

We need the fourth letter to be E. So the word must have the fourth character as E.

For example, ""AGLEE""? Not a word.

""ALLEE"": A, L, L, E, E -> that's a word? It means a tree-lined path. But it has duplicate L and E? And E at position 4 and 5.

But let's see: A _ _ E _ -> so position 4 is E, and position 5 is the last letter.

In ""ALLEE"": 
  Position 1: A
  Position 2: L
  Position 3: L
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: E

So it fits the pattern.

But we have to check if the letters are allowed: L is not excluded, E is already known. But we have two E's? The secret word might have two E's? We don't know.

But in our feedback, we only know one E (at position 4) but there could be more.

Similarly, A is at position 1 and we don't know if there is another A.

But in this case, ""ALLEE"" has two E's and one A.

But we must avoid excluded letters: C, R, T, D, I, U. L is not excluded, so it's okay.

But is ""ALLEE"" common? Maybe not.

Another word: ""AGAPE"": A, G, A, P, E -> positions: 1:A, 2:G, 3:A, 4:P, 5:E -> fourth letter is P, not E.

""AMIDE"": A, M, I, D, E -> but I and D are excluded? From second guess, D and I are absent. So not.

""ANODE"": A, N, O, D, E -> D is excluded.

""ABODE"": A, B, O, D, E -> D excluded.

""ALIKE"": A, L, I, K, E -> I excluded.

It's challenging. Let me think of words that have E at position 4.

Another: ""AWARE"": A, W, A, R, E -> R is excluded.

""AZURE"": A, Z, U, R, E -> U and R excluded.

""OPERA"": but doesn't start with A.

We need to start with A.

""ARISE"": A, R, I, S, E -> R and I excluded.

""ABASE"": doesn't have E at 4.

Perhaps: ""AEGIS"" -> A, E, G, I, S -> but E is at position 2, not 4.

I think I need to search for words that start with A and have E as the fourth letter.

Some possibilities:

- ACNES: A, C, N, E, S -> but C is excluded? From first guess, C is absent. So not.

- ADZES: A, D, Z, E, S -> D is excluded.

- AGUES: A, G, U, E, S -> U excluded.

- ALMES: A, L, M, E, S -> this might work? ""ALMES"" is not a common word? It might be obsolete.

- ALECS: A, L, E, C, S -> but E is at position 3? Not 4.

- ALKYD: A, L, K, Y, D -> D excluded and no E at 4.

Perhaps I should consider that the secret word might have the letter E at position 4, and then the fifth letter is part of the word.

Another idea: ""APPEL"": A, P, P, E, L -> positions: 1:A, 2:P, 3:P, 4:E, 5:L -> yes! Fourth letter is E.

And ""APPEL"" is a valid word (a term in law or fencing).

Now, check the letters: A, P, P, E, L.

We know A and E are in the word (and we are placing A at 1 and E at 4, which is correct).

P and L are new letters, not excluded.

Also, no excluded letters: C, R, T, D, I, U are not in this word.

So ""APPEL"" is a candidate.

Other words:

- ARMER: but R excluded.

- ASTER: A, S, T, E, R -> T and R excluded.

- AVERT: A, V, E, R, T -> R and T excluded.

- ""ASKEW"": A, S, K, E, W -> fourth letter is E? Positions: 1:A, 2:S, 3:K, 4:E, 5:W -> yes.

""ASKEW"" is a common word.

Letters: A, S, K, E, W.

Excluded letters: none of these are in the excluded list (C,R,T,D,I,U).

So ""ASKEW"" is also a candidate.

Another: ""ASPEN"": A, S, P, E, N -> fourth letter is E? 1:A,2:S,3:P,4:E,5:N -> yes, but E is at position 4? No: in ""ASPEN"", the letters are A,S,P,E,N so position 4 is E? Let's count:

Position 1: A
Position 2: S
Position 3: P
Position 4: E
Position 5: N

Yes, so ""ASPEN"" has E at position 4.

But ""ASPEN"" is a proper noun? It's a tree, so it's acceptable.

But in Wordle, proper nouns are not used? Actually, Wordle uses common words, and ""ASPEN"" is a common noun.

But let's see: we have two good candidates: ""APPEL"" and ""ASKEW"" and ""ASPEN"".

We can choose one that uses more common letters to get information.

We know the first letter is A and fourth is E, so we are really guessing positions 2,3,5.

In ""APPEL"": positions 2:P, 3:P, 5:L
In ""ASKEW"": positions 2:S, 3:K, 5:W
In ""ASPEN"": positions 2:S, 3:P, 5:N

We want to maximize information. Since we have no information about the middle letters, we can choose a word that has common letters.

S is a very common letter, so ""ASKEW"" or ""ASPEN"" might be better.

Also, ""ASKEW"" has W which is less common, but it's okay.

Another common word: ""ASHEN"": A, S, H, E, N -> positions: 1:A,2:S,3:H,4:E,5:N -> yes.

""ASHEN"" is a word.

So candidates: APPEL, ASKEW, ASPEN, ASHEN.

We can choose ""ASHEN"" because it has S, H, N which are common.

But we don't have any information about H or N.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has a letter we haven't tried, to see if it's present.

But since we are constrained by the pattern, we have to choose a word that fits.

I think any of these are fine.

Let me pick ""ASHEN"" because it has common letters.

But note: we are also trying to get feedback on the letters in positions 2,3,5.

If we guess ""ASHEN"", then:

- A: already correct (position 1)
- S: if it is in the word, we'll get feedback on its position (position 2)
- H: similarly (position 3)
- E: already correct (position 4)
- N: similarly (position 5)

But we don't know if S, H, N are in the word.

Alternatively, if we guess ""APPEL"", we are guessing P at 2 and 3, and L at 5. But if P is not in the word, then we get two x's for the P's? That might be inefficient.

So ""ASHEN"" or ""ASKEW"" might be better because they have distinct letters.

Between ""ASHEN"" and ""ASKEW"", ""ASHEN"" has more common letters.

But let's see the frequency: S is very common, H is common, N is common.

In ""ASKEW"", S is common, K is common, W is less common.

So ""ASHEN"" might be better.

Another candidate: ""AXMEN"" -> not a word.

""AMBER"": A, M, B, E, R -> but R is excluded.

""ALBEE"": A, L, B, E, E -> has E at position 4 and 5? Positions: 1:A,2:L,3:B,4:E,5:E -> and E is at 4 and 5. But we know E is at 4, so if there is another E at 5, that's possible. But R is not in it? But we have to avoid R? ""ALBEE"" has no R, but it has B and L and E. But is it a word? It's a surname, but not common.

Stick to common words.

""ASHEN"" seems good.

But let's confirm: ""ASHEN"" means of a pale grayish color.

Yes.

So I'll go with ""ASHEN"".

But wait, in ""ASHEN"", the fourth letter is E? Let's spell: A-S-H-E-N -> positions: 1:A, 2:S, 3:H, 4:E, 5:N. Yes.

And no excluded letters.

So guess: ASHEN

But we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't have evidence, but it's possible.

But ""ASHEN"" has no duplicates.

So let's use that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRATE**  
  Feedback: C(✗), R(✗), A(➖), T(✗), E(➖)  
  Interpretation:  
  - A and E are in the secret word but not in positions 3 or 5.  
  - C, R, and T are **absent** from the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: ADIEU**  
  Feedback: A(✓), D(✗), I(✗), E(✓), U(✗)  
  Interpretation:  
  - A is **correctly placed at position 1**.  
  - E is **correctly placed at position 4**.  
  - D, I, and U are **absent** from the secret word.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:  
   - Position 1: **A** (fixed).  
   - Position 4: **E** (fixed).  
   - The secret word structure is: `A _ _ E _`.  
   
2. **Absent Letters**:  
   - C, R, T (from Guess 1), and D, I, U (from Guess 2) are **not in the word**.  
   - Avoid using these letters in future guesses.  

3. **Unknown Positions**:  
   - Positions 2, 3, and 5 are unknown.  
   - We need to test new common letters (e.g., S, L, N, O, P, M, B, G, H, K) to gather more clues.  

4. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - The word must start with `A` and have `E` at position 4: `A _ _ E _`.  
   - Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, H, N, L, P) to maximize information.  
   - Avoid reused positions for known letters (A and E are fixed, so focus on positions 2, 3, 5).  
   - Ideal words should test high-frequency consonants/vowels in new positions.  

### Why ""ASHEN""?
- **Fits the Pattern**: `A _ _ E _` → A (pos1), S (pos2), H (pos3), E (pos4), N (pos5).  
- **Tests New Common Letters**:  
  - **S** (high-frequency), **H** (common), **N** (common) — all untested and not excluded.  
- **Avoids Absent Letters**: No C, R, T, D, I, or U.  
- **Information Gain**:  
  - If S, H, or N are in the secret word, feedback will reveal their positions/absence.  
  - If incorrect, we eliminate three common letters, narrowing possibilities significantly.  
- **Common Word**: ""ASHEN"" is a valid English word (meaning pale or grayish), fitting Wordle's dictionary.  

### Other Candidates Considered:
- **ASKEW**: `A S K E W` (tests S, K, W). Chose ""ASHEN"" over this because H and N are more frequent than K and W.  
- **ASPEN**: `A S P E N` (tests S, P, N). Similar to ""ASHEN"", but ""ASHEN"" includes H (slightly more common than P).  
- **APPEL**: `A P P E L` (tests P, L). Less ideal due to duplicate P, which reduces information if P is absent.

<guess>ASHEN</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from Guess 3: ASHEN -> A(✓), S(x), H(x), E(✓), N(x)
 This means:
   - A is correct and in position 1 (already known).
   - E is correct and in position 4 (already known).
   - S, H, and N are not in the word (absent). They are now added to the list of excluded letters.

 Now, we know the secret word has:
   - First letter: A
   - Fourth letter: E
   And the word structure is: A _ _ E _

 We also know the excluded letters: C, R, T, D, I, U, S, H, N (from previous feedback).

 The remaining positions are 2, 3, and 5.

 We need to fill these positions with letters that are not excluded and form a valid English word.

 We now know the word has the form: A _ _ E _

 Excluded letters: C, D, H, I, N, R, S, T, U.

 Available letters: all others in the alphabet, e.g., B, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we have three positions and limited guesses, we want to guess a word that:
   - Fits the structure A _ _ E _
   - Uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.
   - Avoids the excluded letters.

 We can think of common words that start with A, have E as the fourth letter and do not contain any of the excluded letters.

 Let's consider possible letters for positions 2, 3, and 5.

 Position 2: we have no information, so we can try a common letter like L, M, P, etc.
 Position 3: same, common letter.
 Position 5: common letters.

 Some word ideas:

   - ""APPLE"": but has P and L? But wait, ""APPLE"" has P and L, but also note:
        A, P, P, L, E -> but E is at position 5, not 4. And we need E at 4? In ""APPLE"", the fourth letter is L? So not.

   We require the fourth letter to be E. So the word must have E at index 3 (if 0-indexed) or index 4 (1-indexed).

   Let me think of words: A _ _ E _

   Examples:

     - ""AMBLE"": A, M, B, L, E -> structure: A, M, B, L, E -> but E is at position 5? Not at 4. The fourth letter is L? So no.

     - ""AMPLE"": A, M, P, L, E -> same, E at fifth.

     - ""ALLEE"": A, L, L, E, E -> this works? 
          Position 1: A
          Position 2: L
          Position 3: L
          Position 4: E
          Position 5: E
        But E is doubled? And we know E at position 4 is correct. The secret word might have another E? Also, check excluded letters: L is not excluded? So ""ALLEE"" might be a candidate? But it's not a very common word.

     - ""AGLEE"": A, G, L, E, E? Not a word.

     - ""AWAKE"": A, W, A, K, E -> structure: A(1), W(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) -> fourth is K? Not E.

     - ""ABATE"": A, B, A, T, E -> T is excluded? Yes, T is absent. So invalid.

     - ""ABAKE"": not a word.

   After more thought, some valid words:

     - ""APPEL"": A, P, P, E, L -> 
          Position 1: A
          Position 2: P
          Position 3: P
          Position 4: E
          Position 5: L
        This fits the pattern. Also, letters: P, P, L - which are not excluded (assuming P and L are allowed).

     - ""ASKEW"": A, S, K, E, W -> but S is excluded now? From Guess 3, S is absent. So we cannot use S.

     - ""ASPEN"": A, S, P, E, N -> S and N are excluded? Yes, from Guess 3.

     - ""ASHED"": A, S, H, E, D -> S, H, D are excluded? So no.

   So ""APPEL"" is a candidate: A, P, P, E, L -> but L is at position 5? And no excluded letters? 
        Excluded: C, D, H, I, N, R, S, T, U -> P and L are not in that list.

   But note: we have two P's? If the secret word has only one P, then one of them might be marked absent? But that's okay because we are testing.

   Another candidate: ""AMBER"" -> A, M, B, E, R -> but R is excluded? R is absent. So no.

   ""ABBES"": A, B, B, E, S -> S is excluded? And E at fourth? 
        Positions: A(1), B(2), B(3), E(4), S(5) -> but S is excluded.

   ""AKEES"": not common.

   ""ALLEE"": already discussed.

   ""AMPLE"": A, M, P, L, E -> but fourth is L? So the E is at the end? Not at position 4.

   We must have E at position 4.

   Another: ""ABBEY"": A, B, B, E, Y -> 
        Position 1: A
        Position 2: B
        Position 3: B
        Position 4: E
        Position 5: Y
        This fits! And letters: B, B, Y -> B and Y are not excluded? 
          Excluded letters: C,D,H,I,N,R,S,T,U -> B and Y are allowed.

   So ""ABBEY"" is a candidate.

   Also: ""AGLEY"": not common.

   ""ALLEY"": A, L, L, E, Y -> but the fourth letter is E? 
        Positions: A(1), L(2), L(3), E(4), Y(5) -> yes! And L and Y are not excluded.

   ""ALLEY"" is a common word.

   So we have:
        APPEL: uses P and L
        ABBEY: uses B and Y
        ALLEY: uses L and Y

   But note: ""APPEL"" has two P's? If the secret word has only one P, we might get feedback: the second P might be marked differently? But we can still get information.

   However, ""ALLEY"" has two L's? Similarly.

   Since we have limited options, let's choose the most common word.

   ""ALLEY"" is more common than ""APPEL"" and ""ABBEY""? 

   Actually, ""ALLEY"" is very common.

   But let's see what letters they use.

   We don't have information about P, L, B, Y, etc.

   We can pick ""ALLEY"" because it tests L and Y.

   Also, note: in the word ""ALLEY"", we have:
        Position 2: L -> we are testing L at position 2.
        Position 3: L -> also L at position 3? But if the secret word has only one L, then one might be marked differently? We'll get information.

   Another option: ""AGAPE"" -> A, G, A, P, E -> but fourth letter is P? So E is at fifth? No.

   Actually, we can list:

   - ""ABBEY"": tests B (twice) and Y? Actually, two B's and one Y.
   - ""ALLEY"": tests L (twice) and Y.
   - ""APPEL"": tests P (twice) and L.

   Since ""ALLEY"" is a common word, I choose that.

   But wait: what about ""AMBER""? That has excluded letters? R excluded.

   ""ANKLE"" -> N excluded, and E at fifth.

   So ""ALLEY"" seems a good choice.

   However, note: the secret word might not have two L's? But ""ALLEY"" does. But if the secret word has only one L, then the feedback might show one L as '-' (if present) and the other as 'x'? Or if L is present only once, then depending on the position, one L might be '-' and the other 'x'? Actually, because of the positions.

   But we don't know. We'll get information.

   Alternatively, can we find a word without duplicates? 

   For example, other words: 

     - ""ABASE"": A, B, A, S, E -> S excluded? And E at fifth? No.

     - ""AGAPE"": A, G, A, P, E -> structure: A(1), G(2), A(3), P(4), E(5) -> but we need E at position 4? So P is at 4? Not E.

     - ""AVIZE"": not common.

     - ""ABIDE"": A, B, I, D, E -> I and D excluded.

     - ""ALIVE"": A, L, I, V, E -> I excluded.

     - ""ABOVE"": A, B, O, V, E -> but E at fifth? No.

   Another possibility: ""ADOZE"": not common.

   ""AGONE"": A, G, O, N, E -> N excluded? And E at fifth? No.

   ""ALATE"": T excluded.

   So it seems difficult to find a word without duplicates? 

   But some words: 

     - ""AJPES"": not a word.

     - ""ALEEM"": not common.

     - ""ARGLE"": R excluded.

     I can't find many.

   What about ""AWARE"": A, W, A, R, E -> R excluded? And structure: fourth is R? Not E.

   Actually, another word: ""AUREI"": A, U, R, E, I -> U, R, I excluded? So no.

   Another: ""ADDLE"": A, D, D, L, E -> D excluded? Yes.

   ""ADOBE"": A, D, O, B, E -> D excluded.

   ""AGENE"": N excluded.

   So we might need to go with words that have E at position 4 and possibly duplicates? 

   We have ""ABBEY"", ""ALLEY"", and ""APPEL"". Also ""ABBEY"" has two B's, ""ALLEY"" has two L's, ""APPEL"" has two P's.

   Among these, ""ALLEY"" is the most common.

   Or ""AGREE"": A, G, R, E, E -> R excluded? R is excluded? And G,R,E -> R is excluded? So no.

   Another: ""AFFIX"": A, F, F, I, X -> I excluded.

   ""ALKYL"": K and Y -> but the fourth letter is Y? Not E.

   So let's use ""ALLEY"".

   We'll guess ""ALLEY"".

   Also, note: if the secret word is ""ALLEY"", we get it. Otherwise, we get feedback.

   We have only 3 guesses left? We started with 6, and this is the fourth guess.

   So we can afford.

   Let me also check: ""APPLE"" is not a candidate because E is at fifth.

   Thus, we choose ""ALLEY"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 3: ASHEN**  
  Feedback: A(✓), S(✗), H(✗), E(✓), N(✗)  
  Interpretation:  
  - A (position 1) and E (position 4) are **confirmed** and fixed.  
  - S, H, and N are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - Updated excluded letters: **C, D, H, I, N, R, S, T, U**.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Word Structure**:  
   - Secret word format: `A _ _ E _` (positions 1=A, 4=E).  
   - Positions 2, 3, and 5 are unknown.  

2. **Confirmed Constraints**:  
   - Excluded letters: **C, D, H, I, N, R, S, T, U** cannot appear anywhere.  
   - Must use only untested letters (e.g., B, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).  

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Prioritize common letters not excluded (e.g., **L, Y, B, P, M**) to test positions 2, 3, and 5.  
   - Choose a word that maximizes information on potential letter placements.  
   - Ideal candidates: Words fitting `A _ _ E _` without excluded letters.  

### Why ""ALLEY""?
- **Fits Pattern**: `A L L E Y` → A (1), L (2), L (3), E (4), Y (5).  
- **Tests New Common Letters**:  
  - **L** (high-frequency consonant) and **Y** (common vowel substitute) are untested.  
- **Avoids Excluded Letters**: No matches with banned list.  
- **Information Gain**:  
  - If L is in the word, feedback reveals correct/incorrect positions (positions 2 and 3).  
  - If Y is in the word, feedback shows if position 5 is correct.  
- **Valid English Word**: ""ALLEY"" is common (noun: a narrow street).  

### Other Candidates Considered and Rejected:
- **APPEL** (`A P P E L`): Uses P and L, but duplicate P reduces information efficiency.  
- **ABBEY** (`A B B E Y`): Uses B and Y, but duplicates B; slightly less common than ""ALLEY"".  
- **AMPLE** (`A M P L E`): Incorrect format (position 4 must be E, not L).  
- **ASKEW** (`A S K E W`): Invalid due to excluded ""S"".

These are common letters.\n   - It includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.\n\n However, note that the word ""ROAST"" is also a good one because it has common letters and R and S are very common.\n\n Let me compare:\n   - ""RAISE"" has R, A, I, S, E. It includes three vowels (A, I, E) which might be helpful.\n\n But since it\'s the first guess, we can choose any of these. \n\n I\'ll go with ""RAISE"".

For an optimal first guess, I should choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the potential feedback. The word should include frequent vowels and consonants while avoiding duplicate letters to cover more ground. \n\n""CRATE"" is a strong choice because:\n- Contains common letters: C, R, A, T, E\n- Includes two vowels (A, E) and three consonants\n- Covers frequent letters found in English 5-letter words\n\nThis guess will likely provide helpful feedback on letter presence and positioning for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>CRATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess: CRATE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), T(x), E(-)\n This means:\n   - A and E are in the secret word but not in the positions they were guessed (since they are marked as -).\n   - C, R, T are not in the secret word at all (marked as x).\n\n Important: Since A and E are present but not in the guessed positions, we know:\n   - The word contains A and E, but the A is not at position 3 (since in CRATE, A is the third letter) and E is not at position 5.\n\n Also, note that positions: \n   C (1st) -> absent\n   R (2nd) -> absent\n   A (3rd) -> present but wrong position\n   T (4th) -> absent\n   E (5th) -> present but wrong position\n\n Now, we have two confirmed letters: A and E.\n\n For the next guess, we need to:\n   - Choose a 5-letter English word that includes A and E (since they are in the secret word).\n   - Avoid using any of the absent letters: C, R, T (because they are not in the word at all). Also note that R was absent in the first guess, so R is not in the word? Wait, but the feedback for R was (x) meaning it is not in the word. Similarly for C and T.\n\n However, note: It\'s possible that a letter might appear more than once? But the rules don\'t specify. In Wordle, usually words can have repeated letters, but in this feedback, we must note:\n   - The feedback symbol for each instance is independent. Since we only guessed one of each, and they were marked as absent, that means at least in those positions we don\'t have them. But if a letter is marked absent, it means that the total count of that letter in the secret word is less than the count we guessed? Actually, standard Wordle rules: if a letter is not in the word at all, it gets marked absent. If it is in the word but we have more copies than in the word, then the extra copies might be marked absent.\n\n Since we have only one instance of each in the guess, and they are marked absent, we can assume that the secret word does not contain C, R, or T.\n\n But wait: what about the letter R? We guessed R in position 2 and it was marked absent. Similarly, T in position 4 absent. So we know R and T are not in the word.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid letters C, R, T.\n\n Additionally, we know A and E are in the word, but not in positions 3 and 5.\n\n Now, let\'s think of a good next guess.\n\n We should look for words that:\n   - Are 5 letters\n   - Contain A and E\n   - Exclude C, R, T\n   - Also, we can try to use common letters to get more information.\n\n Since A and E are already confirmed, we can put them in different positions. Remember A cannot be at position 3 and E cannot be at position 5.\n\n We have three positions to fill: 1, 2, 4 (since position 3 must not be A and position 5 must not be E, but note: we might put A or E in one of the other positions? Actually, we can put A in 1,2,4 or 5? But we already know E cannot be at 5? However, we might put E in 1,2,3, or 4? Similarly, A in 1,2,4,5? But we don\'t know about position 1 and 2 and 4.\n\n We must also choose letters that are common and haven\'t been ruled out.\n\n Available letters: except C,R,T, and we know A and E are in the word.\n\n Let me think: we have 26 letters minus C,R,T -> 23 letters. But we might include other common letters.\n\n I am considering using a word with A and E and three new letters.\n\n A good strategy is to try to cover vowel possibilities and common consonants.\n\n Since we know A and E are present, we can focus on finding positions and including other common vowels/consonants.\n\n Common letters: S, L, N, O, I, D, H, etc.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that includes A and E and three of these, avoiding C,R,T.\n\n Also, we must avoid placing A at position 3 and E at position 5.\n\n Some word ideas:\n\n - Option: ""LEMON"": but this has O and M? Wait, but it also has L,E,M,O,N -> but we are missing A? We must include A, because A is confirmed.\n\n So we need words that have A and E.\n\n Some words that contain A and E: ""LATHE"" -> but T is ruled out? No, T is absent so we cannot use T.\n\n Another: ""SLATE"" -> but has T, which is ruled out? And also R? No, SLATE has T? We cannot use T.\n\n Words without C,R,T and with A and E:\n\n   ""AGILE"": contains A, G, I, L, E? -> Yes. But note positions:\n      Position 1: A -> however, we don\'t know if A can be at position 1? Our feedback didn\'t rule that out.\n      Position 5: E -> but in the first guess, E was at position 5 and we know it\'s not there? So putting E at position 5 would be bad? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? But we can put E elsewhere.\n\n   In ""AGILE"":\n      A at 1, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is the same as before? We know E is not at 5, so if we put E at 5, we are going to get a \'-\' because E is in the word but wrong position? Actually, we are not sure: the feedback for E at position 5 was \'-\', meaning that E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we guess E again at position 5, we would get \'-\' again (if the secret word doesn\'t have E at 5) or \'✓\' if by chance it is? But we already know it\'s not at 5, so putting E at position 5 again is wasteful.\n\n   So ideally, we put E at a new position (either 1,2,3,4) and similarly A at a new position (not 3).\n\n   For AGILE: \n        Position 1: A -> if we put A at 1, we might get:\n            If the secret word has A at 1: ✓\n            If not: then \'-\' meaning A is present but not at 1 (and also not at 3) so it would be in 2,4 or 5? But wait, if the secret word has A at 4, then we will get \'-\' for A at 1.\n        Position 5: E -> this is the same position as before, and we know E is not at 5, so we will get \'-\' for E again? So that doesn\'t tell us anything new about E.\n\n   So let\'s avoid putting E at position 5.\n\n   We can choose a word that puts E at positions 1,2,3,4 and A at 1,2,4,5 (but not 3 and also we avoid the same position if we can get new information).\n\n   Example words:\n\n     - Place A at position 1: e.g., ""ABIDE"" -> includes A at 1 and E at 5? But we don\'t want E at 5. Also, E at 5 is the same as before? So no.\n\n     - Place E at position 1: ""EARLY"" -> but has R? We cannot use R.\n\n     - ""LEAST"": but has T? Cannot use T.\n\n     - ""PASTE"": again, has S, T -> T is not allowed.\n\n     - ""DATE"": only 4 letters? Must be 5.\n\n     - Let me think: words without C,R,T and with A and E, and E not at 5.\n\n     Some candidates:\n\n        ""SNAKE"": \n            S, N, A, K, E -> includes S,N,A,K,E -> no R,T,C.\n            Positions: \n               S:1, N:2, A:3 -> but wait, the first guess ruled out A at position 3? So if we put A at 3 again, we will get \'-\' (since A is present but not at position 3). But we already know that? So it doesn\'t give new information? Ideally, we want to put A in a new position to test.\n\n        ""PLANE"":\n            P,L,A,N,E -> no C,R,T.\n            Positions: A at 3? Again, same as before.\n\n        We cannot put A at position 3? So we need a word that has A not at position 3 and also E not at position 5.\n\n        How about ""PLANE"" but rearrange? We can\'t rearrange arbitrarily, must be a valid word.\n\n        Let me list:\n\n          ""ADIEU"": has A and E, and vowels? But let\'s see:\n             A:1, D:2, I:3, E:4, U:5 -> note E is at position 4, not 5? and A is at 1. \n          But does it avoid C,R,T? Yes.\n\n          However, the first guess had A at 3 and E at 5. Now we have A at 1 and E at 4.\n\n          This seems good: because we are testing A at a different position and E at a different position.\n\n        Also, ""ADIEU"" is a common word used in Wordle as a starter? But we are not using it as starter. But okay.\n\n        What other words?\n\n        ""AISLE"": \n            A at 1, E at 5? But E at 5 we know is not correct? So that\'s inefficient.\n\n        ""ABASE"":\n            A at 1, B, A, S, E -> wait, duplicate A? Not necessarily bad, but we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s. However, we know A is present at least once. But our guess has two A\'s? So if the secret word has exactly one A, then one A might be marked ✓ or - and the other marked x? But that might give extra info? But let\'s avoid duplication for now?\n\n        ""ADIEU"" seems efficient because:\n          - It uses A and E (which we know are in the word)\n          - It places A at position 1 (which we haven\'t tested) and E at position 4 (which we haven\'t tested)\n          - And includes D, I, U which are new letters.\n\n        Also, it avoids C,R,T.\n\n        But note: in the feedback we got, A was marked as present but wrong position. What if the secret word has A at position 1? Then by guessing A at position 1, we\'ll get a ✓ for A? Similarly, if E is at position 4, we get ✓. Otherwise, we might get more \'-\' or even a ✓ if A is at 1 or E at 4.\n\n        So let\'s choose ""ADIEU"".\n\n        Another option: ""MEDIA"": \n            M,E,D,I,A -> positions: E at 2, A at 5 -> but A at 5: we haven\'t tested A at 5? And E at 2? That\'s good. Also, avoids C,R,T.\n\n        But ""ADIEU"" and ""MEDIA"" are both valid. \n\n        How about ""ANIME"": \n            A at 1, N, I, M, E -> E at 5? again.\n\n        So ""MEDIA"" puts E at 2 and A at 5? But note: in the first guess, we had E at 5? And we know E is not at position 5? So putting A at 5 and E at 2? That seems okay.\n\n        However, we know E is present but not at position 5. If we put E at 2 and get a \'-\', that tells us E is in the word but not at 2? Then we know it must be at 1,3 or 4? Similarly, for A we know it is not at 3. So if we put A at 5, and we get \'-\', that tells us A is not at 5? Then A must be at 1,2, or 4? But we don\'t have a test for A at 1? We did test A at 3 and now at 5? So not covering position 1 or 2.\n\n        Alternatively, with ""ADIEU"": \n          Positions for A: 1 -> test position 1\n          Positions for E: 4 -> test position 4\n\n        So if we get:\n          A at 1: ✓ or \'-\'? \n          E at 4: ✓ or \'-\'?\n\n        That would be more informative because we are testing two new positions.\n\n        Also, in ""MEDIA"", E at 2 and A at 5? We test E at 2 and A at 5? But we already know E cannot be at 5? And we don\'t have a test for A at 1? So ""ADIEU"" seems better.\n\n        However, note: what if the secret word has A and E? And we are testing A at 1 and E at 4? That might get us two ✓ if they are correctly placed? Otherwise, if not, we get information.\n\n        I\'ll go with ""ADIEU"".\n\n        So the second guess: ADIEU\n\n        But note: ""ADIEU"" is a valid English word? Yes, it means goodbye.\n\n        Also, it has the following letters: A, D, I, E, U. None of the absent letters.\n\n        So let\'s use that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"", I analyzed the following:\n- C, R, and T are **NOT** in the secret word (marked ✗).\n- A and E are in the word but NOT in positions 3 and 5 respectively (marked -).\n- Therefore, the secret word contains A and E but excludes C, R, T.\n\nFor the second guess, I prioritized:\n1. **Including A and E** while avoiding C, R, T.\n2. **Testing new positions**: A should not be in position 3 (already tested), and E should not be in position 5 (already tested). I chose positions that maximize new information: A in position 1 and E in position 4.\n3. **Covering new common letters**: S, L, N, P, D, I, etc., to gather more clues.\n4. **Avoiding reused positions** for known letters to learn about their correct placements.\n\n""ADIEU"" is a strong choice because:\n- Contains A (position 1) and E (position 4), both in new untested positions.\n- Avoids C, R, T; introduces new letters: D, I, U.\n- Tests vowel-heavy combinations efficiently, helping narrow down possibilities.\n\n<guess>ADIEU</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: ADIEU -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) I(x) E(✓) U(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRATE\n  C: x (absent)\n  R: x (absent)\n  A: - (present, but wrong position; not position 3)\n  T: x (absent)\n  E: - (present, but wrong position; not position 5)\n\nGuess 2: ADIEU\n  A: ✓ (correct position, so A is at position 1)\n  D: x (absent)\n  I: x (absent)\n  E: ✓ (correct position, so E is at position 4)\n  U: x (absent)\n\nNow, we know:\n- The secret word has A at position 1 and E at position 4.\n- The secret word does not contain: C, R, T, D, I, U.\n- We have two known letters: A (pos1) and E (pos4).\n\nThe word structure is: A _ _ E _\n\nWe need to fill the middle three positions (positions 2, 3, and 5) with letters that are not in the excluded list (C, R, T, D, I, U) and are English letters.\n\nAlso, note that from the first guess, we know that A is not at position 3 (which we already know because now A is at 1) and E is not at position 5 (which we already know because E is at 4).

We can try to use other common consonants and vowels.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: S, L, N, O, P, M, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe can form words like: ABLE, AGLE (not a word), AISLE (but I is excluded), etc.\n\nLet\'s list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid excluded letters.\n\nPattern: A _ _ E _\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ABBEY? -> 5 letters? ABBEY has two B\'s and ends with Y? But pattern: A, B, B, E, Y -> but E is at position 4? Then the fifth is Y? So ""ABB E Y"" -> but that\'s A, B, B, E, Y -> positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:B, 4:E, 5:Y -> but we need the fourth to be E? Yes. However, we have two B\'s? And we don\'t know if B is allowed? We haven\'t tested B.\n\nBut we must avoid: C, R, T, D, I, U. B is not in that list, so it\'s allowed.\n\nBut is ABBEY a valid word? Yes.\n\nBut let\'s see if there are more common words.\n\nAnother: ABLE? But ABLE is 4 letters. We need 5. So not.\n\n- AGILE? But I is excluded.\n\n- ALONE: A, L, O, N, E -> but E is at position 5? We need E at position 4. So pattern: A _ _ E _ -> so the fourth letter must be E. In ALONE, the fourth letter is N? So not.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be E. So the word must be: A _ _ E _\n\nSo the third letter is the one before E? So the word has the form: A X Y E Z, where X, Y, Z are letters to be chosen.\n\nNow, we need English words of that form.\n\nSome examples:\n\n- APPLE: A, P, P, L, E -> but wait, the fourth letter is L? Then E is at fifth? But we need E at fourth? So no.\n\n- AMPLE: A, M, P, L, E -> again, E at fifth? Not at fourth.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be E. So the word must have E as the fourth letter.\n\nFor example: \n  A _ _ E A -> but then the last letter is A? But we already have A at first? And we don\'t know if A can be repeated? The feedback didn\'t show any duplicate, but it\'s possible.\n\nBut let\'s see: the first guess had no duplicate, and second guess had no duplicate. But the secret word might have duplicates? We don\'t know.\n\nBut to be safe, we can consider both cases.\n\nHowever, let\'s list words that have E at position 4.\n\nCommon words:\n\n- AZURE: A, Z, U, R, E -> but U and R are excluded? R is excluded from first guess? Yes, R is absent. So not.\n\n- AWAKE: A, W, A, K, E -> but E is at fifth? Not fourth.\n\n- ABASE: A, B, A, S, E -> E at fifth? Not fourth.\n\n- ABATE: A, B, A, T, E -> T is excluded, and E at fifth.\n\n- AGATE: A, G, A, T, E -> T excluded.\n\n- ALATE: not common, and T excluded.\n\n- AMAZE: A, M, A, Z, E -> E at fifth.\n\nIt seems difficult? Maybe I\'m missing.\n\nWhat about: A _ _ E _ \n\nLet me think of words that end with ""E"" in the fourth position? Actually, the fifth letter is after E? So the word ends with E? No, the fourth is E, then fifth is another letter.\n\nSo the word has the form: A??E?\n\nExamples:\n\n- AXLE: A, X, L, E, ? -> but AXLE is 4 letters? We need 5.\n\n5-letter words:\n\n- ANKLE: A, N, K, L, E -> but E is at fifth? Not fourth.\n\n- APPLE: A, P, P, L, E -> E at fifth.\n\n- ABUSE: A, B, U, S, E -> U is excluded? From second guess, U is absent. So not.\n\n- AMUSE: A, M, U, S, E -> U excluded.\n\n- AWAKE: A, W, A, K, E -> E at fifth.\n\nWait, I think I have a mistake: the pattern is A _ _ E _ meaning:\n\nPosition 1: A\nPosition 2: ?\nPosition 3: ?\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: ?\n\nSo the word ends with E? No, position 4 is E, so position 5 is the last letter and can be anything.\n\nFor example, ""ABASE"" is A, B, A, S, E -> positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:A, 4:S, 5:E -> so the fourth letter is S, not E. So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be E. So the word must have the fourth character as E.\n\nFor example, ""AGLEE""? Not a word.\n\n""ALLEE"": A, L, L, E, E -> that\'s a word? It means a tree-lined path. But it has duplicate L and E? And E at position 4 and 5.\n\nBut let\'s see: A _ _ E _ -> so position 4 is E, and position 5 is the last letter.\n\nIn ""ALLEE"": \n  Position 1: A\n  Position 2: L\n  Position 3: L\n  Position 4: E\n  Position 5: E\n\nSo it fits the pattern.\n\nBut we have to check if the letters are allowed: L is not excluded, E is already known. But we have two E\'s? The secret word might have two E\'s? We don\'t know.\n\nBut in our feedback, we only know one E (at position 4) but there could be more.\n\nSimilarly, A is at position 1 and we don\'t know if there is another A.\n\nBut in this case, ""ALLEE"" has two E\'s and one A.\n\nBut we must avoid excluded letters: C, R, T, D, I, U. L is not excluded, so it\'s okay.\n\nBut is ""ALLEE"" common? Maybe not.\n\nAnother word: ""AGAPE"": A, G, A, P, E -> positions: 1:A, 2:G, 3:A, 4:P, 5:E -> fourth letter is P, not E.\n\n""AMIDE"": A, M, I, D, E -> but I and D are excluded? From second guess, D and I are absent. So not.\n\n""ANODE"": A, N, O, D, E -> D is excluded.\n\n""ABODE"": A, B, O, D, E -> D excluded.\n\n""ALIKE"": A, L, I, K, E -> I excluded.\n\nIt\'s challenging. Let me think of words that have E at position 4.\n\nAnother: ""AWARE"": A, W, A, R, E -> R is excluded.\n\n""AZURE"": A, Z, U, R, E -> U and R excluded.\n\n""OPERA"": but doesn\'t start with A.\n\nWe need to start with A.\n\n""ARISE"": A, R, I, S, E -> R and I excluded.\n\n""ABASE"": doesn\'t have E at 4.\n\nPerhaps: ""AEGIS"" -> A, E, G, I, S -> but E is at position 2, not 4.\n\nI think I need to search for words that start with A and have E as the fourth letter.\n\nSome possibilities:\n\n- ACNES: A, C, N, E, S -> but C is excluded? From first guess, C is absent. So not.\n\n- ADZES: A, D, Z, E, S -> D is excluded.\n\n- AGUES: A, G, U, E, S -> U excluded.\n\n- ALMES: A, L, M, E, S -> this might work? ""ALMES"" is not a common word? It might be obsolete.\n\n- ALECS: A, L, E, C, S -> but E is at position 3? Not 4.\n\n- ALKYD: A, L, K, Y, D -> D excluded and no E at 4.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the secret word might have the letter E at position 4, and then the fifth letter is part of the word.\n\nAnother idea: ""APPEL"": A, P, P, E, L -> positions: 1:A, 2:P, 3:P, 4:E, 5:L -> yes! Fourth letter is E.\n\nAnd ""APPEL"" is a valid word (a term in law or fencing).\n\nNow, check the letters: A, P, P, E, L.\n\nWe know A and E are in the word (and we are placing A at 1 and E at 4, which is correct).\n\nP and L are new letters, not excluded.\n\nAlso, no excluded letters: C, R, T, D, I, U are not in this word.\n\nSo ""APPEL"" is a candidate.\n\nOther words:\n\n- ARMER: but R excluded.\n\n- ASTER: A, S, T, E, R -> T and R excluded.\n\n- AVERT: A, V, E, R, T -> R and T excluded.\n\n- ""ASKEW"": A, S, K, E, W -> fourth letter is E? Positions: 1:A, 2:S, 3:K, 4:E, 5:W -> yes.\n\n""ASKEW"" is a common word.\n\nLetters: A, S, K, E, W.\n\nExcluded letters: none of these are in the excluded list (C,R,T,D,I,U).\n\nSo ""ASKEW"" is also a candidate.\n\nAnother: ""ASPEN"": A, S, P, E, N -> fourth letter is E? 1:A,2:S,3:P,4:E,5:N -> yes, but E is at position 4? No: in ""ASPEN"", the letters are A,S,P,E,N so position 4 is E? Let\'s count:\n\nPosition 1: A\nPosition 2: S\nPosition 3: P\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: N\n\nYes, so ""ASPEN"" has E at position 4.\n\nBut ""ASPEN"" is a proper noun? It\'s a tree, so it\'s acceptable.\n\nBut in Wordle, proper nouns are not used? Actually, Wordle uses common words, and ""ASPEN"" is a common noun.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have two good candidates: ""APPEL"" and ""ASKEW"" and ""ASPEN"".\n\nWe can choose one that uses more common letters to get information.\n\nWe know the first letter is A and fourth is E, so we are really guessing positions 2,3,5.\n\nIn ""APPEL"": positions 2:P, 3:P, 5:L\nIn ""ASKEW"": positions 2:S, 3:K, 5:W\nIn ""ASPEN"": positions 2:S, 3:P, 5:N\n\nWe want to maximize information. Since we have no information about the middle letters, we can choose a word that has common letters.\n\nS is a very common letter, so ""ASKEW"" or ""ASPEN"" might be better.\n\nAlso, ""ASKEW"" has W which is less common, but it\'s okay.\n\nAnother common word: ""ASHEN"": A, S, H, E, N -> positions: 1:A,2:S,3:H,4:E,5:N -> yes.\n\n""ASHEN"" is a word.\n\nSo candidates: APPEL, ASKEW, ASPEN, ASHEN.\n\nWe can choose ""ASHEN"" because it has S, H, N which are common.\n\nBut we don\'t have any information about H or N.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has a letter we haven\'t tried, to see if it\'s present.\n\nBut since we are constrained by the pattern, we have to choose a word that fits.\n\nI think any of these are fine.\n\nLet me pick ""ASHEN"" because it has common letters.\n\nBut note: we are also trying to get feedback on the letters in positions 2,3,5.\n\nIf we guess ""ASHEN"", then:\n\n- A: already correct (position 1)\n- S: if it is in the word, we\'ll get feedback on its position (position 2)\n- H: similarly (position 3)\n- E: already correct (position 4)\n- N: similarly (position 5)\n\nBut we don\'t know if S, H, N are in the word.\n\nAlternatively, if we guess ""APPEL"", we are guessing P at 2 and 3, and L at 5. But if P is not in the word, then we get two x\'s for the P\'s? That might be inefficient.\n\nSo ""ASHEN"" or ""ASKEW"" might be better because they have distinct letters.\n\nBetween ""ASHEN"" and ""ASKEW"", ""ASHEN"" has more common letters.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency: S is very common, H is common, N is common.\n\nIn ""ASKEW"", S is common, K is common, W is less common.\n\nSo ""ASHEN"" might be better.\n\nAnother candidate: ""AXMEN"" -> not a word.\n\n""AMBER"": A, M, B, E, R -> but R is excluded.\n\n""ALBEE"": A, L, B, E, E -> has E at position 4 and 5? Positions: 1:A,2:L,3:B,4:E,5:E -> and E is at 4 and 5. But we know E is at 4, so if there is another E at 5, that\'s possible. But R is not in it? But we have to avoid R? ""ALBEE"" has no R, but it has B and L and E. But is it a word? It\'s a surname, but not common.\n\nStick to common words.\n\n""ASHEN"" seems good.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: ""ASHEN"" means of a pale grayish color.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""ASHEN"".\n\nBut wait, in ""ASHEN"", the fourth letter is E? Let\'s spell: A-S-H-E-N -> positions: 1:A, 2:S, 3:H, 4:E, 5:N. Yes.\n\nAnd no excluded letters.\n\nSo guess: ASHEN\n\nBut we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t have evidence, but it\'s possible.\n\nBut ""ASHEN"" has no duplicates.\n\nSo let\'s use that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: CRATE**  \n  Feedback: C(✗), R(✗), A(➖), T(✗), E(➖)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - A and E are in the secret word but not in positions 3 or 5.  \n  - C, R, and T are **absent** from the secret word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ADIEU**  \n  Feedback: A(✓), D(✗), I(✗), E(✓), U(✗)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - A is **correctly placed at position 1**.  \n  - E is **correctly placed at position 4**.  \n  - D, I, and U are **absent** from the secret word.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:  \n   - Position 1: **A** (fixed).  \n   - Position 4: **E** (fixed).  \n   - The secret word structure is: `A _ _ E _`.  \n   \n2. **Absent Letters**:  \n   - C, R, T (from Guess 1), and D, I, U (from Guess 2) are **not in the word**.  \n   - Avoid using these letters in future guesses.  \n\n3. **Unknown Positions**:  \n   - Positions 2, 3, and 5 are unknown.  \n   - We need to test new common letters (e.g., S, L, N, O, P, M, B, G, H, K) to gather more clues.  \n\n4. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  \n   - The word must start with `A` and have `E` at position 4: `A _ _ E _`.  \n   - Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, H, N, L, P) to maximize information.  \n   - Avoid reused positions for known letters (A and E are fixed, so focus on positions 2, 3, 5).  \n   - Ideal words should test high-frequency consonants/vowels in new positions.  \n\n### Why ""ASHEN""?\n- **Fits the Pattern**: `A _ _ E _` → A (pos1), S (pos2), H (pos3), E (pos4), N (pos5).  \n- **Tests New Common Letters**:  \n  - **S** (high-frequency), **H** (common), **N** (common) — all untested and not excluded.  \n- **Avoids Absent Letters**: No C, R, T, D, I, or U.  \n- **Information Gain**:  \n  - If S, H, or N are in the secret word, feedback will reveal their positions/absence.  \n  - If incorrect, we eliminate three common letters, narrowing possibilities significantly.  \n- **Common Word**: ""ASHEN"" is a valid English word (meaning pale or grayish), fitting Wordle\'s dictionary.  \n\n### Other Candidates Considered:\n- **ASKEW**: `A S K E W` (tests S, K, W). Chose ""ASHEN"" over this because H and N are more frequent than K and W.  \n- **ASPEN**: `A S P E N` (tests S, P, N). Similar to ""ASHEN"", but ""ASHEN"" includes H (slightly more common than P).  \n- **APPEL**: `A P P E L` (tests P, L). Less ideal due to duplicate P, which reduces information if P is absent.\n\n<guess>ASHEN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: ADIEU -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) I(x) E(✓) U(x)\nGuess 3: ASHEN -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) S(x) H(x) E(✓) N(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from Guess 3: ASHEN -> A(✓), S(x), H(x), E(✓), N(x)\n This means:\n   - A is correct and in position 1 (already known).\n   - E is correct and in position 4 (already known).\n   - S, H, and N are not in the word (absent). They are now added to the list of excluded letters.\n\n Now, we know the secret word has:\n   - First letter: A\n   - Fourth letter: E\n   And the word structure is: A _ _ E _\n\n We also know the excluded letters: C, R, T, D, I, U, S, H, N (from previous feedback).\n\n The remaining positions are 2, 3, and 5.\n\n We need to fill these positions with letters that are not excluded and form a valid English word.\n\n We now know the word has the form: A _ _ E _\n\n Excluded letters: C, D, H, I, N, R, S, T, U.\n\n Available letters: all others in the alphabet, e.g., B, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n Since we have three positions and limited guesses, we want to guess a word that:\n   - Fits the structure A _ _ E _\n   - Uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.\n   - Avoids the excluded letters.\n\n We can think of common words that start with A, have E as the fourth letter and do not contain any of the excluded letters.\n\n Let\'s consider possible letters for positions 2, 3, and 5.\n\n Position 2: we have no information, so we can try a common letter like L, M, P, etc.\n Position 3: same, common letter.\n Position 5: common letters.\n\n Some word ideas:\n\n   - ""APPLE"": but has P and L? But wait, ""APPLE"" has P and L, but also note:\n        A, P, P, L, E -> but E is at position 5, not 4. And we need E at 4? In ""APPLE"", the fourth letter is L? So not.\n\n   We require the fourth letter to be E. So the word must have E at index 3 (if 0-indexed) or index 4 (1-indexed).\n\n   Let me think of words: A _ _ E _\n\n   Examples:\n\n     - ""AMBLE"": A, M, B, L, E -> structure: A, M, B, L, E -> but E is at position 5? Not at 4. The fourth letter is L? So no.\n\n     - ""AMPLE"": A, M, P, L, E -> same, E at fifth.\n\n     - ""ALLEE"": A, L, L, E, E -> this works? \n          Position 1: A\n          Position 2: L\n          Position 3: L\n          Position 4: E\n          Position 5: E\n        But E is doubled? And we know E at position 4 is correct. The secret word might have another E? Also, check excluded letters: L is not excluded? So ""ALLEE"" might be a candidate? But it\'s not a very common word.\n\n     - ""AGLEE"": A, G, L, E, E? Not a word.\n\n     - ""AWAKE"": A, W, A, K, E -> structure: A(1), W(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) -> fourth is K? Not E.\n\n     - ""ABATE"": A, B, A, T, E -> T is excluded? Yes, T is absent. So invalid.\n\n     - ""ABAKE"": not a word.\n\n   After more thought, some valid words:\n\n     - ""APPEL"": A, P, P, E, L -> \n          Position 1: A\n          Position 2: P\n          Position 3: P\n          Position 4: E\n          Position 5: L\n        This fits the pattern. Also, letters: P, P, L - which are not excluded (assuming P and L are allowed).\n\n     - ""ASKEW"": A, S, K, E, W -> but S is excluded now? From Guess 3, S is absent. So we cannot use S.\n\n     - ""ASPEN"": A, S, P, E, N -> S and N are excluded? Yes, from Guess 3.\n\n     - ""ASHED"": A, S, H, E, D -> S, H, D are excluded? So no.\n\n   So ""APPEL"" is a candidate: A, P, P, E, L -> but L is at position 5? And no excluded letters? \n        Excluded: C, D, H, I, N, R, S, T, U -> P and L are not in that list.\n\n   But note: we have two P\'s? If the secret word has only one P, then one of them might be marked absent? But that\'s okay because we are testing.\n\n   Another candidate: ""AMBER"" -> A, M, B, E, R -> but R is excluded? R is absent. So no.\n\n   ""ABBES"": A, B, B, E, S -> S is excluded? And E at fourth? \n        Positions: A(1), B(2), B(3), E(4), S(5) -> but S is excluded.\n\n   ""AKEES"": not common.\n\n   ""ALLEE"": already discussed.\n\n   ""AMPLE"": A, M, P, L, E -> but fourth is L? So the E is at the end? Not at position 4.\n\n   We must have E at position 4.\n\n   Another: ""ABBEY"": A, B, B, E, Y -> \n        Position 1: A\n        Position 2: B\n        Position 3: B\n        Position 4: E\n        Position 5: Y\n        This fits! And letters: B, B, Y -> B and Y are not excluded? \n          Excluded letters: C,D,H,I,N,R,S,T,U -> B and Y are allowed.\n\n   So ""ABBEY"" is a candidate.\n\n   Also: ""AGLEY"": not common.\n\n   ""ALLEY"": A, L, L, E, Y -> but the fourth letter is E? \n        Positions: A(1), L(2), L(3), E(4), Y(5) -> yes! And L and Y are not excluded.\n\n   ""ALLEY"" is a common word.\n\n   So we have:\n        APPEL: uses P and L\n        ABBEY: uses B and Y\n        ALLEY: uses L and Y\n\n   But note: ""APPEL"" has two P\'s? If the secret word has only one P, we might get feedback: the second P might be marked differently? But we can still get information.\n\n   However, ""ALLEY"" has two L\'s? Similarly.\n\n   Since we have limited options, let\'s choose the most common word.\n\n   ""ALLEY"" is more common than ""APPEL"" and ""ABBEY""? \n\n   Actually, ""ALLEY"" is very common.\n\n   But let\'s see what letters they use.\n\n   We don\'t have information about P, L, B, Y, etc.\n\n   We can pick ""ALLEY"" because it tests L and Y.\n\n   Also, note: in the word ""ALLEY"", we have:\n        Position 2: L -> we are testing L at position 2.\n        Position 3: L -> also L at position 3? But if the secret word has only one L, then one might be marked differently? We\'ll get information.\n\n   Another option: ""AGAPE"" -> A, G, A, P, E -> but fourth letter is P? So E is at fifth? No.\n\n   Actually, we can list:\n\n   - ""ABBEY"": tests B (twice) and Y? Actually, two B\'s and one Y.\n   - ""ALLEY"": tests L (twice) and Y.\n   - ""APPEL"": tests P (twice) and L.\n\n   Since ""ALLEY"" is a common word, I choose that.\n\n   But wait: what about ""AMBER""? That has excluded letters? R excluded.\n\n   ""ANKLE"" -> N excluded, and E at fifth.\n\n   So ""ALLEY"" seems a good choice.\n\n   However, note: the secret word might not have two L\'s? But ""ALLEY"" does. But if the secret word has only one L, then the feedback might show one L as \'-\' (if present) and the other as \'x\'? Or if L is present only once, then depending on the position, one L might be \'-\' and the other \'x\'? Actually, because of the positions.\n\n   But we don\'t know. We\'ll get information.\n\n   Alternatively, can we find a word without duplicates? \n\n   For example, other words: \n\n     - ""ABASE"": A, B, A, S, E -> S excluded? And E at fifth? No.\n\n     - ""AGAPE"": A, G, A, P, E -> structure: A(1), G(2), A(3), P(4), E(5) -> but we need E at position 4? So P is at 4? Not E.\n\n     - ""AVIZE"": not common.\n\n     - ""ABIDE"": A, B, I, D, E -> I and D excluded.\n\n     - ""ALIVE"": A, L, I, V, E -> I excluded.\n\n     - ""ABOVE"": A, B, O, V, E -> but E at fifth? No.\n\n   Another possibility: ""ADOZE"": not common.\n\n   ""AGONE"": A, G, O, N, E -> N excluded? And E at fifth? No.\n\n   ""ALATE"": T excluded.\n\n   So it seems difficult to find a word without duplicates? \n\n   But some words: \n\n     - ""AJPES"": not a word.\n\n     - ""ALEEM"": not common.\n\n     - ""ARGLE"": R excluded.\n\n     I can\'t find many.\n\n   What about ""AWARE"": A, W, A, R, E -> R excluded? And structure: fourth is R? Not E.\n\n   Actually, another word: ""AUREI"": A, U, R, E, I -> U, R, I excluded? So no.\n\n   Another: ""ADDLE"": A, D, D, L, E -> D excluded?

We have feedback from Guess 4: ALLEY -> A(✓), L(x), L(x), E(✓), Y(✓)

Interpretation:
- A is correct at position 1 (already known).
- E is correct at position 4 (already known).
- Y is correct at position 5! So the secret word ends with Y.
- The two L's are marked as absent (x). This means that the letter L is not in the secret word at all? But note: we have two L's in the guess, both marked absent. This typically means that the secret word does not contain the letter L.

However, we must be cautious: if the secret word had one L, then one of the L's might be marked as present (if in the word but wrong position) or absent (if not in the word). But here both are marked absent, so it means the secret word has no L.

Therefore, we now know:
- The secret word is: A _ _ E Y
- Excluded letters: C, D, H, I, N, R, S, T, U, L (from previous feedback and this guess)
- Also, we know that the word ends with Y.

We need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters that are not excluded and form a valid English word.

Excluded letters: C, D, H, I, L, N, R, S, T, U.

Available letters: B, F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a word of the form: A ? ? E Y

We must choose two letters for positions 2 and 3 from the available set.

Let's think of common words that fit this pattern.

Examples:
- ""ABBEY"": A, B, B, E, Y -> but we have two B's? And B is available.
  However, we have excluded L? But B is not excluded. But note: in ""ABBEY"", the fourth letter is E? Actually, in ""ABBEY"": 
      Position 1: A
      Position 2: B
      Position 3: B
      Position 4: E
      Position 5: Y
  So it fits. But we have two B's? We don't know if the secret word has two B's.

- ""ABSEY"": not a word.

- ""AGLEY"": not common.

- ""APSEY"": not common.

- ""AVIZE"": not common.

- ""AWAKE"": A, W, A, K, E -> but E is at fifth? Not at fourth. And we have A at third? But we need E at fourth.

- ""ABBEY"" seems a strong candidate.

But let's check the feedback: in the previous guess, we had ""ALLEY"" and got Y as correct at position 5. So the secret word ends with Y.

Now, ""ABBEY"" is a valid word and fits the pattern.

But we have to consider: are there other possibilities?

Another word: ""AMBEY""? Not a word.

""AGAPE"": doesn't end with Y.

""ABBEY"" is the most common word that fits.

But note: we have excluded L, and ""ABBEY"" has no L. Also, it uses B, which is available.

But we have two B's? If the secret word has only one B, then one of the B's might be marked as absent? But we are guessing the whole word.

Alternatively, are there words with distinct letters?

For example, ""AWFUL"": but F and U? U is excluded? And doesn't end with E Y.

We need A ? ? E Y.

Another word: ""APERY"": A, P, E, R, Y -> but R is excluded? And the fourth letter is R? Not E. So no.

""AVERY"": A, V, E, R, Y -> R excluded? And structure: A(1), V(2), E(3), R(4), Y(5) -> but we need E at position 4? Here E is at position 3. So no.

""AGLEY"": A, G, L, E, Y -> but L is excluded? So not.

""ABSEY"": not a word.

""ABBEY"" is the only common word I can think of.

But let me confirm: is there ""AUMRY""? Not common.

""ABBEY"" is a valid word and fits: A, B, B, E, Y.

We have not used B before? So it's allowed.

So we guess ""ABBEY"".

But note: in the feedback for ""ALLEY"", we got Y(✓) at position 5, so we know the last letter is Y. And E at position 4 is fixed. So the word is A _ _ E Y.

Now, if we guess ""ABBEY"", and if it's not the word, we might get feedback that helps.

But since we have few options, and ""ABBEY"" is a common word, we go with that.

Alternatively, if we want to test more letters, we might choose a word that uses two different letters? But we don't have many common words.

Another possibility: ""AVIDE""? Not a word.

""AMIDE"": I and D excluded.

""ABODE"": D and O? But D excluded.

""ABOVE"": O and V? But structure: A, B, O, V, E -> E at fifth? Not at fourth.

So I think ""ABBEY"" is the best guess.

Thus, we choose ""ABBEY"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 4: ALLEY**  
  Feedback: A(✓), L(✗), L(✗), E(✓), Y(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - A (position 1) and E (position 4) are **confirmed** (already known).  
  - Y is **correctly placed at position 5** (new information).  
  - Both L's are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - Updated excluded letters: **C, D, H, I, L, N, R, S, T, U**.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Word Structure**:  
   - Secret word format: `A _ _ E Y` (positions 1=A, 4=E, 5=Y).  
   - Positions 2 and 3 are unknown.  

2. **Confirmed Constraints**:  
   - Excluded letters: **C, D, H, I, L, N, R, S, T, U** cannot appear.  
   - Must use untested letters (e.g., **B, F, G, K, M, O, P, V, W, X, Z**) for positions 2 and 3.  

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - The only common English word fitting `A _ _ E Y` is **""ABBEY""** (A, B, B, E, Y).  
   - Tests **B** (high-frequency consonant) in positions 2 and 3.  
   - If incorrect, feedback will confirm/reject B and reveal its position (if present).  

### Why ""ABBEY""?
- **Fits Pattern**: `A B B E Y` → Matches the confirmed positions (1=A, 4=E, 5=Y).  
- **Uses New Letters**: Tests **B** (untested, not excluded).  
- **Information Gain**:  
  - If B is in the word, feedback reveals if positions 2/3 are correct.  
  - If B is absent, it narrows possibilities to rare letters (e.g., G, K, M).  
- **Valid English Word**: ""ABBEY"" is common (noun: a monastery or church).
