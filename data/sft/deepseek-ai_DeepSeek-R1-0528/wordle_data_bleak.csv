Alright, let's start this Wordle game. I need to make the first guess. Since I have no information yet, I should pick a word that gives me the most useful feedback. 

The goal is to cover common letters and positions. A good starting word typically uses common vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting some correct letters. 

I recall that common English letters are E, A, R, O, T, etc. Words with a mix of vowels and consonants help test different positions. 

Considering the feedback symbols: 
- ✓ means correct letter in the correct spot.
- - means letter is in the word but wrong position.
- x means letter not in the word.

For the first guess, words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are often recommended because they include common letters. 

""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E. It uses two vowels (A and E) and three consonants, covering frequent letters. 

Alternative options might be ""ROATE"" but that's less common. ""SLATE"" is another strong starter with S, L, A, T, E.

Between these, ""CRANE"" seems solid because it includes A and E (common vowels), and C, R, N which are fairly common consonants. 

Also, positioning: ""CRANE"" starts with a consonant which is more typical for English words, whereas something like ""ADIEU"" might over-index on vowels but leave consonants untested.

So, ""CRANE"" should be a balanced first guess. It might reveal the presence of key letters and their possible positions.

After considering common starting words that maximize the use of frequent letters (like vowels A, E and consonants R, S, T, N, C), I chose **CRANE** for my first guess. It covers:

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)

This means:
- C is not in the secret word.
- R is not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in the position we guessed (position 3).
- N is not in the secret word.
- E is in the word but not in the position we guessed (position 5).

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and E, but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
- The letters C, R, and N are absent.

We must avoid using C, R, and N in our next guess.

Also, since A is in the word but not at position 3, and E is in the word but not at position 5, we should try to place A and E in different positions.

We have 6 tries, so we are on the second guess.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Includes A and E (since they are present in the secret word)
- Excludes C, R, N
- Places A not in position 3 and E not in position 5.

Additionally, we want to test new letters to get more information.

Common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. We already have A and E, so we might want to test other vowels (I, O, U) and common consonants that are not excluded.

Excluded consonants: C, R, N. So we can use others like S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

We should try to put A and E in positions we haven't tested yet. For A, we know it's not at position 3, so we can try positions 1, 2, 4, or 5. But note: we must not put E at position 5.

Let's think of words that have A and E, and avoid C, R, N.

Possible words: 
- We could try ""SALET"" (a word from Wordle strategies) but that has S, A, L, E, T. However, we don't know if S, L, T are in the word. Also, we can place A and E in new positions.

But note: we have to avoid the known absent letters.

Another idea: since A is not at 3 and E is not at 5, we can try:
- A at position 1 and E at position 2? But that might be too early to fix positions.

Alternatively, we can try to put A in position 1 and E in position 4, for example.

Let's list some words that fit:
- ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> A at position 2? Actually: S(1), A(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). But we cannot put E at position 5 because the feedback said E is not at position 5. So we must avoid putting E at position 5.

So ""SAUTE"" has E at position 5 -> invalid for E placement.

We need a word that has E not at position 5. So E can be at 1,2,3,4.

Similarly, A must not be at position 3, so we can put it at 1,2,4,5.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. The feedback doesn't show duplicates, so we assume no duplicates for now (unless feedback indicates otherwise).

Let's try to form a word with A and E and three new consonants.

Possible words:
- ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> A at position 3? But we cannot put A at position 3 because the feedback said A is not at position 3. So we must avoid that. In ""PLATE"", A is at position 3 -> invalid.

- ""LEAST"": L, E, A, S, T -> E at position 1, A at position 3? Again, A at 3 is invalid.

We need to avoid position 3 for A and position 5 for E.

How about ""TALES"": T, A, L, E, S -> A at position 2, E at position 4. This avoids A at 3 and E at 5. Also, the letters are T, A, L, E, S. None of these are excluded (C, R, N are excluded, but T, L, S are new).

But note: the word ""TALES"" has E at position 4? Let's check:
Position 1: T
Position 2: A
Position 3: L
Position 4: E
Position 5: S

So A is at 2 (not 3) and E is at 4 (not 5). This is acceptable.

Another option: ""SLATE"" -> S, L, A, T, E -> A at position 3 -> invalid.

""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E -> A at position 3 -> invalid.

""STEAL"": S, T, E, A, L -> E at position 3, A at position 4. This avoids A at 3 and E at 5? E is at 3 (which is okay) and A at 4 (okay). Also, E is not at 5. So that's acceptable.

But in ""STEAL"", we have E at 3 and A at 4. We also have S, T, L.

We could also consider ""LATTE"" but that has double T? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But the rules don't say they aren't, so it's possible. However, we are trying to get maximum information, so using distinct letters is better.

But in our case, we already know A and E are in the word, so we want to test new letters. So ""TALES"" and ""STEAL"" are both good.

Another word: ""PASTE"" -> P, A, S, T, E -> A at position 2, E at position 5 -> but E at 5 is invalid because we know E is not at position 5. So avoid.

""HASTE"" -> same issue: E at 5.

""BAKER"" -> but R is excluded, so we cannot use R.

We must avoid R.

So ""TALES"" and ""STEAL"" are both valid.

Let me choose one. I'll go with ""STEAL"" because it places E in a new position (3) and A in position 4, which we haven't tested for A. Also, it uses common letters.

But note: in ""STEAL"", we have:
S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, L at 5.

We know E is in the word but not at 5, so putting E at 3 is safe. Similarly, A is not at 3, so putting at 4 is safe.

We also test S, T, L.

Alternatively, ""TALES"" has T at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5. This tests A at 2 and E at 4.

Both are good. I think I'll go with ""STEAL"" to see if E is at position 3 and A at 4.

But we don't have any information about the positions of A and E, so we are just trying new positions.

Another word: ""ADIEU"" has A at 1 and E at 4? But we have D, I, U. However, we know A is in the word, so we can use it. But ""ADIEU"" has A at 1 and E at 4. But we also have I and U to test. However, we must avoid R, C, N. This word doesn't use them. But note: we already know A and E are in the word, so we might want to test more new letters. ""ADIEU"" tests A, D, I, E, U. That's three vowels (A, I, E, U) and one consonant (D). It might be too vowel-heavy and not test enough consonants.

So I think ""STEAL"" is better because it tests three new consonants (S, T, L) and the two vowels we know (A and E) in new positions.

Therefore, I choose ""STEAL"" as the next guess.

But let me confirm: the word ""STEAL"" is valid? Yes, it means to take something without permission.

So, next guess: STEAL
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are **absent** from the secret word.
- A is **present** but not in position 3.
- E is **present** but not in position 5.

For the next guess:
- Must include A and E (since they are in the secret word).
- Must exclude C, R, and N.
- A cannot be placed in position 3.
- E cannot be placed in position 5.
- Aim to test new letters (like S, T, L) and new positions for A and E to gather more information.

The word ""steal"" fits these criteria:
- Contains A (placed in position 4, avoiding position 3) and E (placed in position 3, avoiding position 5).
- Uses new common consonants (S, T, L) not yet tested.
- Avoids excluded letters (C, R, N).
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of A and E while testing three new letters.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let's start this Wordle game. I need to make the first guess. Since I have no information yet, I should pick a word that gives me the most useful feedback. 

The goal is to cover common letters and positions. A good starting word typically uses common vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting some correct letters. 

I recall that common English letters are E, A, R, O, T, etc. Words with a mix of vowels and consonants help test different positions. 

Considering the feedback symbols: 
- ✓ means correct letter in the correct spot.
- - means letter is in the word but wrong position.
- x means letter not in the word.

For the first guess, words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are often recommended because they include common letters. 

""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E. It uses two vowels (A and E) and three consonants, covering frequent letters. 

Alternative options might be ""ROATE"" but that's less common. ""SLATE"" is another strong starter with S, L, A, T, E.

Between these, ""CRANE"" seems solid because it includes A and E (common vowels), and C, R, N which are fairly common consonants. 

Also, positioning: ""CRANE"" starts with a consonant which is more typical for English words, whereas something like ""ADIEU"" might over-index on vowels but leave consonants untested.

So, ""CRANE"" should be a balanced first guess. It might reveal the presence of key letters and their possible positions.After considering common starting words that maximize the use of frequent letters (like vowels A, E and consonants R, S, T, N, C), I chose **CRANE** for my first guess. It covers:
- 3 common consonants (C, R, N)
- 2 vowels (A, E)
- Tests positions for frequent starting letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)

This means:
- C is not in the secret word.
- R is not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in the position we guessed (position 3).
- N is not in the secret word.
- E is in the word but not in the position we guessed (position 5).

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and E, but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
- The letters C, R, and N are absent.

We must avoid using C, R, and N in our next guess.

Also, since A is in the word but not at position 3, and E is in the word but not at position 5, we should try to place A and E in different positions.

We have 6 tries, so we are on the second guess.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Includes A and E (since they are present in the secret word)
- Excludes C, R, N
- Places A not in position 3 and E not in position 5.

Additionally, we want to test new letters to get more information.

Common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. We already have A and E, so we might want to test other vowels (I, O, U) and common consonants that are not excluded.

Excluded consonants: C, R, N. So we can use others like S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

We should try to put A and E in positions we haven't tested yet. For A, we know it's not at position 3, so we can try positions 1, 2, 4, or 5. But note: we must not put E at position 5.

Let's think of words that have A and E, and avoid C, R, N.

Possible words: 
- We could try ""SALET"" (a word from Wordle strategies) but that has S, A, L, E, T. However, we don't know if S, L, T are in the word. Also, we can place A and E in new positions.

But note: we have to avoid the known absent letters.

Another idea: since A is not at 3 and E is not at 5, we can try:
- A at position 1 and E at position 2? But that might be too early to fix positions.

Alternatively, we can try to put A in position 1 and E in position 4, for example.

Let's list some words that fit:
- ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> A at position 2? Actually: S(1), A(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). But we cannot put E at position 5 because the feedback said E is not at position 5. So we must avoid putting E at position 5.

So ""SAUTE"" has E at position 5 -> invalid for E placement.

We need a word that has E not at position 5. So E can be at 1,2,3,4.

Similarly, A must not be at position 3, so we can put it at 1,2,4,5.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. The feedback doesn't show duplicates, so we assume no duplicates for now (unless feedback indicates otherwise).

Let's try to form a word with A and E and three new consonants.

Possible words:
- ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> A at position 3? But we cannot put A at position 3 because the feedback said A is not at position 3. So we must avoid that. In ""PLATE"", A is at position 3 -> invalid.

- ""LEAST"": L, E, A, S, T -> E at position 1, A at position 3? Again, A at 3 is invalid.

We need to avoid position 3 for A and position 5 for E.

How about ""TALES"": T, A, L, E, S -> A at position 2, E at position 4. This avoids A at 3 and E at 5. Also, the letters are T, A, L, E, S. None of these are excluded (C, R, N are excluded, but T, L, S are new).

But note: the word ""TALES"" has E at position 4? Let's check:
Position 1: T
Position 2: A
Position 3: L
Position 4: E
Position 5: S

So A is at 2 (not 3) and E is at 4 (not 5). This is acceptable.

Another option: ""SLATE"" -> S, L, A, T, E -> A at position 3 -> invalid.

""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E -> A at position 3 -> invalid.

""STEAL"": S, T, E, A, L -> E at position 3, A at position 4. This avoids A at 3 and E at 5? E is at 3 (which is okay) and A at 4 (okay). Also, E is not at 5. So that's acceptable.

But in ""STEAL"", we have E at 3 and A at 4. We also have S, T, L.

We could also consider ""LATTE"" but that has double T? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But the rules don't say they aren't, so it's possible. However, we are trying to get maximum information, so using distinct letters is better.

But in our case, we already know A and E are in the word, so we want to test new letters. So ""TALES"" and ""STEAL"" are both good.

Another word: ""PASTE"" -> P, A, S, T, E -> A at position 2, E at position 5 -> but E at 5 is invalid because we know E is not at position 5. So avoid.

""HASTE"" -> same issue: E at 5.

""BAKER"" -> but R is excluded, so we cannot use R.

We must avoid R.

So ""TALES"" and ""STEAL"" are both valid.

Let me choose one. I'll go with ""STEAL"" because it places E in a new position (3) and A in position 4, which we haven't tested for A. Also, it uses common letters.

But note: in ""STEAL"", we have:
S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, L at 5.

We know E is in the word but not at 5, so putting E at 3 is safe. Similarly, A is not at 3, so putting at 4 is safe.

We also test S, T, L.

Alternatively, ""TALES"" has T at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5. This tests A at 2 and E at 4.

Both are good. I think I'll go with ""STEAL"" to see if E is at position 3 and A at 4.

But we don't have any information about the positions of A and E, so we are just trying new positions.

Another word: ""ADIEU"" has A at 1 and E at 4? But we have D, I, U. However, we know A is in the word, so we can use it. But ""ADIEU"" has A at 1 and E at 4. But we also have I and U to test. However, we must avoid R, C, N. This word doesn't use them. But note: we already know A and E are in the word, so we might want to test more new letters. ""ADIEU"" tests A, D, I, E, U. That's three vowels (A, I, E, U) and one consonant (D). It might be too vowel-heavy and not test enough consonants.

So I think ""STEAL"" is better because it tests three new consonants (S, T, L) and the two vowels we know (A and E) in new positions.

Therefore, I choose ""STEAL"" as the next guess.

But let me confirm: the word ""STEAL"" is valid? Yes, it means to take something without permission.

So, next guess: STEALBased on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are **absent** from the secret word.
- A is **present** but not in position 3.
- E is **present** but not in position 5.

For the next guess:
- Must include A and E (since they are in the secret word).
- Must exclude C, R, and N.
- A cannot be placed in position 3.
- E cannot be placed in position 5.
- Aim to test new letters (like S, T, L) and new positions for A and E to gather more information.

The word ""steal"" fits these criteria:
- Contains A (placed in position 4, avoiding position 3) and E (placed in position 3, avoiding position 5).
- Uses new common consonants (S, T, L) not yet tested.
- Avoids excluded letters (C, R, N).
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of A and E while testing three new letters.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, N are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""steal"" -> S(x), T(x), E(✓), A(✓), L(-)
Meaning:
- S and T are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since ""steal"" is S-T-E-A-L, so E is the 3rd letter).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- L is in the word but not in position 5.

So, combining the information:

Correctly placed letters:
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: A

We also know that the word contains L, but not in position 5.

Absent letters: C, R, N, S, T

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ E A _

We know the third letter is E and the fourth is A.

The word must contain L, but not in position 5. Since positions 3 and 4 are taken by E and A, L must be in position 1, 2, or 5? But we know L is not in position 5 (from the feedback of ""steal"": L(-) and it was in position 5, so L is present but not at position 5). Therefore, L must be in position 1 or 2.

Also, we know from the first guess that A is not in position 3 (which we already know because now it's in 4) and E is not in position 5 (which is consistent because E is in 3).

Now, the word has five letters: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
We know:
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: cannot be L (since L is not in position 5) and also cannot be any of the absent letters.

Moreover, the word contains L, which must be in position 1 or 2.

We also need to find the remaining letters. Since we have used several common consonants and found them absent, we should consider other common letters.

Absent letters: C, R, N, S, T

So available letters: all except these and the ones we know are present.

Present letters: E, A, L (and we know their positions partially).

We need to fill positions 1, 2, and 5.

Position 5: cannot be L, and must be a letter that is not absent and not already placed? But we don't know if there are duplicates, but let's assume no duplicates for now.

The word has E at 3, A at 4, and L must be at 1 or 2.

So possible patterns:
- L _ E A _
- _ L E A _

But we need to fill the blank with letters that are not absent and form a valid word.

Also, from the first guess, we had A in position 3 (which was wrong) and E in position 5 (which was wrong). Now we have A in 4 and E in 3, so that's consistent.

Now, let's think of words that fit the pattern: _ _ E A _

With L in either first or second position.

First, if L is in position 1: L _ E A _

We need a letter for position 2 and position 5.

Position 5 cannot be L (already used and not at 5) and not absent letters.

Similarly, position 2 must be a letter not absent.

Possible words: 
- L O E A ? -> but ""loea"" is not a root, so words like ""loess"" is 5 letters but has S which is absent. S is absent, so no.

We need to avoid S, T, C, R, N.

Available common consonants: B, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, and vowels: I, O, U (but we already have two vowels, so maybe more consonants).

But the word must be English and common.

Possible words with pattern ? ? E A ? and containing L.

Since L is in position 1 or 2.

List of possible words:

Option 1: L in position 1
- L E E A ? -> but E is already in position 3, and we don't know about duplicates. But if we use E again, it might be possible, but let's avoid for now since we don't have evidence of duplicates.
- L I E A ? -> ""lie"" is the root, so ""lie"" with two more letters? But it's 3 letters. 5-letter words: ""liege"" but G is available? ""liege"" is L-I-E-G-E, but that would be positions: L(1), I(2), E(3), G(4), E(5). But we need position 4 to be A, not G. So no.
- Similarly, ""liver"" but R is absent and position 4 is V, not A.
- ""loyal"" -> L-O-Y-A-L, but that has L at 1 and 5, but we know L is not at position 5? From feedback, L is present but not at 5, so if ""loyal"" has L at 5, it would be incorrect. Also, we have two L's? But the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, so it might be possible? However, in ""steal"", we had L at 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position, meaning L is in the word but not at 5. So if the word has two L's, one at 5 would still be marked as present but wrong position? But in this case, if the word is ""loyal"", then L is at 1 and 5. When we guessed ""steal"" with L at 5, it would be marked as present (because there is an L at 1) but not at 5, so that's consistent. However, we also have position 4: in ""loyal"", position 4 is A, which is correct. Position 3 is Y? But we need position 3 to be E. ""loyal"" is L-O-Y-A-L, so position 3 is Y, not E. So not matching.

We need position 3 to be E and 4 to be A.

So pattern: _ _ E A _

With L in 1 or 2.

Let me think of words ending with ""EA"" but that's not, it's E A _ so the last letter is after A.

Words like ""plead"" but P is available, but ""plead"" is P-L-E-A-D, so positions: P(1), L(2), E(3), A(4), D(5). This fits the pattern.

Similarly, ""bleak"" but B-L-E-A-K, positions: B(1), L(2), E(3), A(4), K(5).

""clean"" but C is absent.

""gleam"" but G-L-E-A-M.

But we have to check absent letters: C, R, N, S, T are absent. So B, D, G, K, M, P, etc. are okay.

Now, in this pattern, if L is in position 2, then position 1 can be various letters.

But we also have the possibility of L in position 1, then position 2 is something.

If L is in position 1: L ? E A ?

Then we need a letter for position 2 and 5.

For example, ""lutea"" is not a common word, ""lumen"" has N which is absent.

""lupus"" has S and U, but S absent.

""leach"" has C absent.

""leapt"" has T absent.

""leave"" has E at 5? But E is already in the word, and we don't know about duplicates. ""leave"" is L-E-A-V-E, so positions: L(1), E(2), A(3)? But we need A at position 4, not 3. And position 3 is A? No: L(1), E(2), A(3), V(4), E(5). But we need position 3 to be E and 4 to be A. Here position 3 is A, which is not E. So no.

Similarly, ""lemon"" has N and O, but N absent.

So it's hard to find words with L in position 1 and then E at 3 and A at 4.

More common is L in position 2.

So let's assume L is in position 2: pattern _ L E A _

Then position 1 and 5 to fill.

Position 1: can be a consonant, and position 5: a letter not absent.

Words: 
- P L E A D -> plead
- B L E A K -> bleak
- B L E A T -> but T is absent, so no.
- F L E A S -> S absent.
- G L E A M -> gleam
- G L E A N -> N absent.
- C L E A R -> C and R absent.
- P L E A T -> T absent.
- B L E A R -> R absent.

So from above, ""plead"" and ""bleak"" and ""gleam"" are candidates.

Also, ""clean"" is out because C absent.

What about ""bleed""? But ""bleed"" is B-L-E-E-D, so position 4 is E, not A.

We need position 4 to be A.

Another one: ""flea"" is 4 letters, so not.

""ileac"" not a word.

So possible words: plead, bleak, gleam.

But we also have to consider that from the first guess, we had A in the word but not at position 3, which is consistent because now A is at 4.

E not at 5, and in these words, E is at 3, so position 5 is D, K, M respectively.

Now, we need to guess one of these or something else.

But we also have the letter L must be present, and in position 2 in these cases.

In ""steal"", we had L at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means L is in the word but not at 5. In these words, L is at position 2, so that's fine.

Now, we have three candidates: plead, bleak, gleam.

But we need to make a guess that can distinguish or confirm.

We have only one more piece of information: from the first guess, we had A and E present, but we already used that.

We don't have information about other letters.

We can guess one of these, but we might need to test for the presence of other letters.

Since we have limited guesses, we should try to guess a word that includes common letters that might be in the word.

But we know the pattern: _ L E A _ 

And we have three possibilities: D, K, M for the last letter? But there might be more.

What about ""plebe"" but that ends with E, and position 4 is B? No, ""plebe"" is P-L-E-B-E, so position 4 is B, not A.

Not.

""oleic"" not common and C absent.

""quell"" but position 3 is E, but 4 is L, not A.

So the main ones are plead, bleak, gleam.

Also, ""sleek"" has S and E at 4? No.

Another one: ""bleep"" has P, but position 4 is P, not A.

So I think plead, bleak, gleam are the main ones.

But let's check if there are others: ""cleat"" has C and T absent.

""bleat"" has T absent.

""glean"" has N absent.

So yes.

Now, we can also consider if L is in position 1, but we couldn't find common words. What about ""label""? ""label"" is L-A-B-E-L, so positions: L(1), A(2), B(3), E(4), L(5). But we need position 3 to be E and 4 to be A. Here position 3 is B and 4 is E, so not matching.

""lapel"" is L-A-P-E-L, positions: L(1), A(2), P(3), E(4), L(5). Again, position 3 is P, not E, and 4 is E, not A.

Not.

So L must be in position 2.

Therefore, the word is of the form ? L E A ?

Now, to guess, we can choose one that tests a common letter.

But we have to avoid absent letters: C, R, N, S, T.

In the candidates:
- plead: P, L, E, A, D
- bleak: B, L, E, A, K
- gleam: G, L, E, A, M

We don't know if B, D, G, K, M are present or not.

We can guess one of these to see.

Since we have three possibilities, and we have more guesses, we can pick one.

But let's see which one is more common or likely.

We also have the feedback from the first guess: when we guessed ""crane"", A was present but not at 3, and E present not at 5. That doesn't add new now.

In ""steal"", we have E and A correct, and L present but not at 5.

Now, for the next guess, I think we should guess ""bleak"" or ""plead"" or ""gleam"".

But to be efficient, we might choose a word that can cover multiple possibilities.

But since the only difference is the first and last letter, we need to test those.

We can choose a word that has letters that are in the possible options.

For example, if we guess ""bleak"", if it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on B, K, etc.

Similarly for others.

But we have position 1 and 5 to determine.

Another idea: we can guess a word that is not necessarily of the pattern but tests other letters to narrow down.

But we know the pattern must be _ L E A _ with L in position 2.

So the word is fixed in positions 2,3,4: L, E, A.

So we only need to find position 1 and 5.

We can guess a word that has the known positions and tests possible letters.

But we have to use a valid word.

Since we know E and A are fixed, we can include them.

But we don't know position 1 and 5.

We can guess ""bleak"" to test B and K.

If we guess ""bleak"" and it's not correct, we might get feedback that B or K is wrong.

But let's see the possible letters for position 1: in our candidates, B, P, G.

For position 5: D, K, M.

But there might be other words? For example, ""flead"" is not common, ""smeak"" not common.

""pleck"" not a word.

So I think the common ones are those three.

Another one: ""bleed"" is not, as above.

""gleek"" not common.

So let's stick with plead, bleak, gleam.

Now, to choose, we can consider letter frequency.

Common consonants for position 1: B, P, G are all possible.

For position 5: D, K, M.

We can guess ""blame"" but ""blame"" is B-L-A-M-E, so positions: B(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). But we need position 3 to be E and 4 to be A. Here position 3 is A and 4 is M, so not matching the pattern.

Not.

So we have to guess one of the three.

I think ""bleak"" is a good choice because B and K are common.

Similarly, ""plead"" has P and D.

""gleam"" has G and M.

Since we have no information, I'll go with ""bleak"".

But let's see if we can make a guess that tests more letters.

For example, we know the word has L, E, A, and two more letters: one at 1 and one at 5.

We can guess a word that has the known positions and uses a set of possible letters.

But it's hard.

Another idea: guess a word like ""blend"" but N is absent, and position 3 is E, but 4 is N? ""blend"" is B-L-E-N-D, so position 4 is N, not A, and N is absent anyway.

Not.

I think we should just guess one of the candidates.

Let me choose ""bleak"".

So guess: bleak

But in ""bleak"", positions: B(1), L(2), E(3), A(4), K(5)

We know position 3 and 4 are fixed, so we are testing B at 1 and K at 5.

If it's correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback on B and K.

But we have other options.

Since we have L in position 2, and we know it, we can include it.

But in the guess, we are including L at position 2, which should be correct? Not necessarily, because we don't know if L is in position 2, only that it is in the word and not at 5. It could be at position 1, but we think it's at 2.

In our earlier reasoning, we concluded L must be at position 1 or 2, but we couldn't find words with L at 1, so we think it's at 2.

But let's double-check if L could be at position 1.

If L is at position 1, then the word is L ? E A ?

And ? at position 2 and 5.

We need a word like that.

For example, ""lutea"" is not common, ""lobar"" has R absent, ""lobed"" has E at 5? ""lobed"" is L-O-B-E-D, so positions: L(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), D(5). But we need position 3 to be E and 4 to be A. Here position 3 is B and 4 is E, not matching.

""laced"" has C absent.

""lamed"" is L-A-M-E-D, positions: L(1), A(2), M(3), E(4), D(5). Position 3 is M, not E.

""lased"" has S absent.

""laved"" is L-A-V-E-D, position 3 is V, not E.

""lemed"" not a word.

""lived"" has V, but position 3 is V, not E.

""loped"" has O, position 3 is O? L-O-P-E-D, position 3 is P, not E.

I can't find a common word with L at 1, E at 3, A at 4.

Therefore, L must be at position 2.

So the pattern is ? L E A ?

Now, back to guessing.

I think ""bleak"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""bleak"":
- If B is correct at position 1, it will be ✓
- L at position 2: since we think L is at 2, it should be ✓, but we don't know for sure? We know L is in the word, and if it is at position 2, it will be ✓. If not, it might be - if it's elsewhere, but we think it must be at 2 because no other positions are available except 1, which we ruled out.

Positions: 1,2,3,4,5. 3 and 4 are E and A, 5 cannot be L, so L must be at 1 or 2. But we think 1 is not possible, so 2.

So L at 2 should be correct.

Similarly, E at 3 ✓, A at 4 ✓.

Then K at 5: if it is correct, ✓, else if K is not in word, x, or if in word but wrong position, -.

But position 5 is the only unknown position, so if K is not the letter, it will be x or -.

Similarly for B.

But in the word, if ""bleak"" is not the secret, then B or K might be wrong.

We can also consider guessing ""plead"" or ""gleam"".

But to decide, let's think about letter frequency.

B is more common than P or G at the beginning? Not sure.

We can use a word that has multiple possibilities, but it's hard.

Another idea: guess a word that has the known positions and tests a set of letters.

For example, guess ""blame"", but as before, it doesn't fit the pattern.

I think we should go with ""bleak"".

So I'll guess ""bleak"".
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback:**
   - **Guess 1 (""crane""):** 
     - C (x) - Absent
     - R (x) - Absent
     - A (-) - Present but wrong position (not position 3)
     - N (x) - Absent
     - E (-) - Present but wrong position (not position 5)
   - **Guess 2 (""steal""):** 
     - S (x) - Absent
     - T (x) - Absent
     - E (✓) - Correct position (position 3)
     - A (✓) - Correct position (position 4)
     - L (-) - Present but wrong position (not position 5)

2. **Key Insights from Feedback:**
   - **Correctly Placed Letters:**
     - Position 3 is **E** (from ""steal"" feedback).
     - Position 4 is **A** (from ""steal"" feedback).
   - **Present Letters (but wrong positions):**
     - **L** is in the word but not at position 5 (from ""steal"" feedback). Since positions 3 and 4 are fixed (E and A), and L cannot be at position 5, it must be in position 1 or 2.
     - **A** was previously misplaced at position 3 (from ""crane"" feedback), which is consistent with its correct position at 4.
   - **Absent Letters:** C, R, N, S, T (cannot appear in the word).
   - **Word Structure:** The secret word must match the pattern `_ _ E A _`, with L in position 1 or 2. Given the constraints, L is likely in position 2 (as position 1 with this pattern yields no common English words—e.g., ""lutea"" is invalid, ""lobar"" has absent R, ""lamed"" mismatches E/A positions).

3. **Deduced Pattern:**
   - The secret word is `? L E A ?` (L in position 2, E in 3, A in 4).
   - Position 1 and 5 need to be filled with letters not in the absent list (C, R, N, S, T) and not conflicting with known positions.
   - Possible candidates (based on common English words):
     - **bleak**: B (position 1), L (2), E (3), A (4), K (5)
     - **gleam**: G (1), L (2), E (3), A (4), M (5)
     - **plead**: P (1), L (2), E (3), A (4), D (5)

4. **Strategy for Next Guess:**
   - Test one of the candidate words to resolve uncertainty.
   - ""bleak"" is chosen because:
     - It includes common letters (B and K) not yet tested.
     - It fits the pattern `? L E A ?` and adheres to all constraints (L in position 2, avoids absent letters).
     - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on B (position 1) and K (position 5) will narrow down possibilities (e.g., if B is absent, ""plead"" or ""gleam"" become more likely).

5. **Final Decision:**
   - Guess **bleak** to test the pattern and gather feedback on the unknown positions.

<guess>bleak</guess>",bleak,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, N are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""steal"" -> S(x), T(x), E(✓), A(✓), L(-)
Meaning:
- S and T are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since ""steal"" is S-T-E-A-L, so E is the 3rd letter).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- L is in the word but not in position 5.

So, combining the information:

Correctly placed letters:
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: A

We also know that the word contains L, but not in position 5.

Absent letters: C, R, N, S, T

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ E A _

We know the third letter is E and the fourth is A.

The word must contain L, but not in position 5. Since positions 3 and 4 are taken by E and A, L must be in position 1, 2, or 5? But we know L is not in position 5 (from the feedback of ""steal"": L(-) and it was in position 5, so L is present but not at position 5). Therefore, L must be in position 1 or 2.

Also, we know from the first guess that A is not in position 3 (which we already know because now it's in 4) and E is not in position 5 (which is consistent because E is in 3).

Now, the word has five letters: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
We know:
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: cannot be L (since L is not in position 5) and also cannot be any of the absent letters.

Moreover, the word contains L, which must be in position 1 or 2.

We also need to find the remaining letters. Since we have used several common consonants and found them absent, we should consider other common letters.

Absent letters: C, R, N, S, T

So available letters: all except these and the ones we know are present.

Present letters: E, A, L (and we know their positions partially).

We need to fill positions 1, 2, and 5.

Position 5: cannot be L, and must be a letter that is not absent and not already placed? But we don't know if there are duplicates, but let's assume no duplicates for now.

The word has E at 3, A at 4, and L must be at 1 or 2.

So possible patterns:
- L _ E A _
- _ L E A _

But we need to fill the blank with letters that are not absent and form a valid word.

Also, from the first guess, we had A in position 3 (which was wrong) and E in position 5 (which was wrong). Now we have A in 4 and E in 3, so that's consistent.

Now, let's think of words that fit the pattern: _ _ E A _

With L in either first or second position.

First, if L is in position 1: L _ E A _

We need a letter for position 2 and position 5.

Position 5 cannot be L (already used and not at 5) and not absent letters.

Similarly, position 2 must be a letter not absent.

Possible words: 
- L O E A ? -> but ""loea"" is not a root, so words like ""loess"" is 5 letters but has S which is absent. S is absent, so no.

We need to avoid S, T, C, R, N.

Available common consonants: B, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, and vowels: I, O, U (but we already have two vowels, so maybe more consonants).

But the word must be English and common.

Possible words with pattern ? ? E A ? and containing L.

Since L is in position 1 or 2.

List of possible words:

Option 1: L in position 1
- L E E A ? -> but E is already in position 3, and we don't know about duplicates. But if we use E again, it might be possible, but let's avoid for now since we don't have evidence of duplicates.
- L I E A ? -> ""lie"" is the root, so ""lie"" with two more letters? But it's 3 letters. 5-letter words: ""liege"" but G is available? ""liege"" is L-I-E-G-E, but that would be positions: L(1), I(2), E(3), G(4), E(5). But we need position 4 to be A, not G. So no.
- Similarly, ""liver"" but R is absent and position 4 is V, not A.
- ""loyal"" -> L-O-Y-A-L, but that has L at 1 and 5, but we know L is not at position 5? From feedback, L is present but not at 5, so if ""loyal"" has L at 5, it would be incorrect. Also, we have two L's? But the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, so it might be possible? However, in ""steal"", we had L at 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position, meaning L is in the word but not at 5. So if the word has two L's, one at 5 would still be marked as present but wrong position? But in this case, if the word is ""loyal"", then L is at 1 and 5. When we guessed ""steal"" with L at 5, it would be marked as present (because there is an L at 1) but not at 5, so that's consistent. However, we also have position 4: in ""loyal"", position 4 is A, which is correct. Position 3 is Y? But we need position 3 to be E. ""loyal"" is L-O-Y-A-L, so position 3 is Y, not E. So not matching.

We need position 3 to be E and 4 to be A.

So pattern: _ _ E A _

With L in 1 or 2.

Let me think of words ending with ""EA"" but that's not, it's E A _ so the last letter is after A.

Words like ""plead"" but P is available, but ""plead"" is P-L-E-A-D, so positions: P(1), L(2), E(3), A(4), D(5). This fits the pattern.

Similarly, ""bleak"" but B-L-E-A-K, positions: B(1), L(2), E(3), A(4), K(5).

""clean"" but C is absent.

""gleam"" but G-L-E-A-M.

But we have to check absent letters: C, R, N, S, T are absent. So B, D, G, K, M, P, etc. are okay.

Now, in this pattern, if L is in position 2, then position 1 can be various letters.

But we also have the possibility of L in position 1, then position 2 is something.

If L is in position 1: L ? E A ?

Then we need a letter for position 2 and 5.

For example, ""lutea"" is not a common word, ""lumen"" has N which is absent.

""lupus"" has S and U, but S absent.

""leach"" has C absent.

""leapt"" has T absent.

""leave"" has E at 5? But E is already in the word, and we don't know about duplicates. ""leave"" is L-E-A-V-E, so positions: L(1), E(2), A(3)? But we need A at position 4, not 3. And position 3 is A? No: L(1), E(2), A(3), V(4), E(5). But we need position 3 to be E and 4 to be A. Here position 3 is A, which is not E. So no.

Similarly, ""lemon"" has N and O, but N absent.

So it's hard to find words with L in position 1 and then E at 3 and A at 4.

More common is L in position 2.

So let's assume L is in position 2: pattern _ L E A _

Then position 1 and 5 to fill.

Position 1: can be a consonant, and position 5: a letter not absent.

Words: 
- P L E A D -> plead
- B L E A K -> bleak
- B L E A T -> but T is absent, so no.
- F L E A S -> S absent.
- G L E A M -> gleam
- G L E A N -> N absent.
- C L E A R -> C and R absent.
- P L E A T -> T absent.
- B L E A R -> R absent.

So from above, ""plead"" and ""bleak"" and ""gleam"" are candidates.

Also, ""clean"" is out because C absent.

What about ""bleed""? But ""bleed"" is B-L-E-E-D, so position 4 is E, not A.

We need position 4 to be A.

Another one: ""flea"" is 4 letters, so not.

""ileac"" not a word.

So possible words: plead, bleak, gleam.

But we also have to consider that from the first guess, we had A in the word but not at position 3, which is consistent because now A is at 4.

E not at 5, and in these words, E is at 3, so position 5 is D, K, M respectively.

Now, we need to guess one of these or something else.

But we also have the letter L must be present, and in position 2 in these cases.

In ""steal"", we had L at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means L is in the word but not at 5. In these words, L is at position 2, so that's fine.

Now, we have three candidates: plead, bleak, gleam.

But we need to make a guess that can distinguish or confirm.

We have only one more piece of information: from the first guess, we had A and E present, but we already used that.

We don't have information about other letters.

We can guess one of these, but we might need to test for the presence of other letters.

Since we have limited guesses, we should try to guess a word that includes common letters that might be in the word.

But we know the pattern: _ L E A _ 

And we have three possibilities: D, K, M for the last letter? But there might be more.

What about ""plebe"" but that ends with E, and position 4 is B? No, ""plebe"" is P-L-E-B-E, so position 4 is B, not A.

Not.

""oleic"" not common and C absent.

""quell"" but position 3 is E, but 4 is L, not A.

So the main ones are plead, bleak, gleam.

Also, ""sleek"" has S and E at 4? No.

Another one: ""bleep"" has P, but position 4 is P, not A.

So I think plead, bleak, gleam are the main ones.

But let's check if there are others: ""cleat"" has C and T absent.

""bleat"" has T absent.

""glean"" has N absent.

So yes.

Now, we can also consider if L is in position 1, but we couldn't find common words. What about ""label""? ""label"" is L-A-B-E-L, so positions: L(1), A(2), B(3), E(4), L(5). But we need position 3 to be E and 4 to be A. Here position 3 is B and 4 is E, so not matching.

""lapel"" is L-A-P-E-L, positions: L(1), A(2), P(3), E(4), L(5). Again, position 3 is P, not E, and 4 is E, not A.

Not.

So L must be in position 2.

Therefore, the word is of the form ? L E A ?

Now, to guess, we can choose one that tests a common letter.

But we have to avoid absent letters: C, R, N, S, T.

In the candidates:
- plead: P, L, E, A, D
- bleak: B, L, E, A, K
- gleam: G, L, E, A, M

We don't know if B, D, G, K, M are present or not.

We can guess one of these to see.

Since we have three possibilities, and we have more guesses, we can pick one.

But let's see which one is more common or likely.

We also have the feedback from the first guess: when we guessed ""crane"", A was present but not at 3, and E present not at 5. That doesn't add new now.

In ""steal"", we have E and A correct, and L present but not at 5.

Now, for the next guess, I think we should guess ""bleak"" or ""plead"" or ""gleam"".

But to be efficient, we might choose a word that can cover multiple possibilities.

But since the only difference is the first and last letter, we need to test those.

We can choose a word that has letters that are in the possible options.

For example, if we guess ""bleak"", if it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on B, K, etc.

Similarly for others.

But we have position 1 and 5 to determine.

Another idea: we can guess a word that is not necessarily of the pattern but tests other letters to narrow down.

But we know the pattern must be _ L E A _ with L in position 2.

So the word is fixed in positions 2,3,4: L, E, A.

So we only need to find position 1 and 5.

We can guess a word that has the known positions and tests possible letters.

But we have to use a valid word.

Since we know E and A are fixed, we can include them.

But we don't know position 1 and 5.

We can guess ""bleak"" to test B and K.

If we guess ""bleak"" and it's not correct, we might get feedback that B or K is wrong.

But let's see the possible letters for position 1: in our candidates, B, P, G.

For position 5: D, K, M.

But there might be other words? For example, ""flead"" is not common, ""smeak"" not common.

""pleck"" not a word.

So I think the common ones are those three.

Another one: ""bleed"" is not, as above.

""gleek"" not common.

So let's stick with plead, bleak, gleam.

Now, to choose, we can consider letter frequency.

Common consonants for position 1: B, P, G are all possible.

For position 5: D, K, M.

We can guess ""blame"" but ""blame"" is B-L-A-M-E, so positions: B(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). But we need position 3 to be E and 4 to be A. Here position 3 is A and 4 is M, so not matching the pattern.

Not.

So we have to guess one of the three.

I think ""bleak"" is a good choice because B and K are common.

Similarly, ""plead"" has P and D.

""gleam"" has G and M.

Since we have no information, I'll go with ""bleak"".

But let's see if we can make a guess that tests more letters.

For example, we know the word has L, E, A, and two more letters: one at 1 and one at 5.

We can guess a word that has the known positions and uses a set of possible letters.

But it's hard.

Another idea: guess a word like ""blend"" but N is absent, and position 3 is E, but 4 is N? ""blend"" is B-L-E-N-D, so position 4 is N, not A, and N is absent anyway.

Not.

I think we should just guess one of the candidates.

Let me choose ""bleak"".

So guess: bleak

But in ""bleak"", positions: B(1), L(2), E(3), A(4), K(5)

We know position 3 and 4 are fixed, so we are testing B at 1 and K at 5.

If it's correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback on B and K.

But we have other options.

Since we have L in position 2, and we know it, we can include it.

But in the guess, we are including L at position 2, which should be correct? Not necessarily, because we don't know if L is in position 2, only that it is in the word and not at 5. It could be at position 1, but we think it's at 2.

In our earlier reasoning, we concluded L must be at position 1 or 2, but we couldn't find words with L at 1, so we think it's at 2.

But let's double-check if L could be at position 1.

If L is at position 1, then the word is L ? E A ?

And ? at position 2 and 5.

We need a word like that.

For example, ""lutea"" is not common, ""lobar"" has R absent, ""lobed"" has E at 5? ""lobed"" is L-O-B-E-D, so positions: L(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), D(5). But we need position 3 to be E and 4 to be A. Here position 3 is B and 4 is E, not matching.

""laced"" has C absent.

""lamed"" is L-A-M-E-D, positions: L(1), A(2), M(3), E(4), D(5). Position 3 is M, not E.

""lased"" has S absent.

""laved"" is L-A-V-E-D, position 3 is V, not E.

""lemed"" not a word.

""lived"" has V, but position 3 is V, not E.

""loped"" has O, position 3 is O? L-O-P-E-D, position 3 is P, not E.

I can't find a common word with L at 1, E at 3, A at 4.

Therefore, L must be at position 2.

So the pattern is ? L E A ?

Now, back to guessing.

I think ""bleak"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""bleak"":
- If B is correct at position 1, it will be ✓
- L at position 2: since we think L is at 2, it should be ✓, but we don't know for sure? We know L is in the word, and if it is at position 2, it will be ✓. If not, it might be - if it's elsewhere, but we think it must be at 2 because no other positions are available except 1, which we ruled out.

Positions: 1,2,3,4,5. 3 and 4 are E and A, 5 cannot be L, so L must be at 1 or 2. But we think 1 is not possible, so 2.

So L at 2 should be correct.

Similarly, E at 3 ✓, A at 4 ✓.

Then K at 5: if it is correct, ✓, else if K is not in word, x, or if in word but wrong position, -.

But position 5 is the only unknown position, so if K is not the letter, it will be x or -.

Similarly for B.

But in the word, if ""bleak"" is not the secret, then B or K might be wrong.

We can also consider guessing ""plead"" or ""gleam"".

But to decide, let's think about letter frequency.

B is more common than P or G at the beginning? Not sure.

We can use a word that has multiple possibilities, but it's hard.

Another idea: guess a word that has the known positions and tests a set of letters.

For example, guess ""blame"", but as before, it doesn't fit the pattern.

I think we should go with ""bleak"".

So I'll guess ""bleak"".### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback:**
   - **Guess 1 (""crane""):** 
     - C (x) - Absent
     - R (x) - Absent
     - A (-) - Present but wrong position (not position 3)
     - N (x) - Absent
     - E (-) - Present but wrong position (not position 5)
   - **Guess 2 (""steal""):** 
     - S (x) - Absent
     - T (x) - Absent
     - E (✓) - Correct position (position 3)
     - A (✓) - Correct position (position 4)
     - L (-) - Present but wrong position (not position 5)

2. **Key Insights from Feedback:**
   - **Correctly Placed Letters:**
     - Position 3 is **E** (from ""steal"" feedback).
     - Position 4 is **A** (from ""steal"" feedback).
   - **Present Letters (but wrong positions):**
     - **L** is in the word but not at position 5 (from ""steal"" feedback). Since positions 3 and 4 are fixed (E and A), and L cannot be at position 5, it must be in position 1 or 2.
     - **A** was previously misplaced at position 3 (from ""crane"" feedback), which is consistent with its correct position at 4.
   - **Absent Letters:** C, R, N, S, T (cannot appear in the word).
   - **Word Structure:** The secret word must match the pattern `_ _ E A _`, with L in position 1 or 2. Given the constraints, L is likely in position 2 (as position 1 with this pattern yields no common English words—e.g., ""lutea"" is invalid, ""lobar"" has absent R, ""lamed"" mismatches E/A positions).

3. **Deduced Pattern:**
   - The secret word is `? L E A ?` (L in position 2, E in 3, A in 4).
   - Position 1 and 5 need to be filled with letters not in the absent list (C, R, N, S, T) and not conflicting with known positions.
   - Possible candidates (based on common English words):
     - **bleak**: B (position 1), L (2), E (3), A (4), K (5)
     - **gleam**: G (1), L (2), E (3), A (4), M (5)
     - **plead**: P (1), L (2), E (3), A (4), D (5)

4. **Strategy for Next Guess:**
   - Test one of the candidate words to resolve uncertainty.
   - ""bleak"" is chosen because:
     - It includes common letters (B and K) not yet tested.
     - It fits the pattern `? L E A ?` and adheres to all constraints (L in position 2, avoids absent letters).
     - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on B (position 1) and K (position 5) will narrow down possibilities (e.g., if B is absent, ""plead"" or ""gleam"" become more likely).

5. **Final Decision:**
   - Guess **bleak** to test the pattern and gather feedback on the unknown positions.",Guess 3: bleak -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) L(✓) E(✓) A(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
