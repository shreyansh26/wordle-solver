We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given the feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(-), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is in the word but not in the first position (since the feedback for the first letter C is '-', meaning wrong position).
 - R is in the word but not in the second position.
 - A, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, we know:
 The secret word contains the letters C and R, but not A, N, or E.
 The letter C cannot be in the first position, and R cannot be in the second position.

 Now, we need to make a second guess.

 Constraints for the next guess:
 1. Must be a 5-letter English word.
 2. Must include C and R (since they are in the secret word) and avoid A, N, E.
 3. Also, the positions of C and R should not be the same as in the first guess (i.e., not position 1 for C and not position 2 for R) because that would be the same incorrect positions.

 We have 3 other positions to consider (3rd, 4th, 5th) and 2 letters (C and R) to place in positions that are not their original ones? Actually, note that the feedback says the letters are in the word but in the wrong position, so they must appear in new positions.

 Additionally, we have three other letters to choose for the remaining three positions. We should try to use common letters that haven't been tried yet (since A, N, E are eliminated).

 Since the word does not contain A, N, or E, we can use other vowels and consonants.

 Common vowels: I, O, U (but note that we must avoid A and E, so O and U are possibilities, and sometimes Y? But Y is less common).

 However, note that the secret word has five letters and we know two of them: C and R. The other three are unknown.

 We can try a word that uses C and R in different positions and also tests some new letters.

 Possible approach: Place C and R in positions that are not 1 and 2. And use new common letters.

 Example placements:
 Let's avoid having the same positions for C and R. So:
 - We shouldn't put C at position 1 (as before) and we shouldn't put R at position 2.

 We can try:
 Option 1: Place C in position 2? -> But note: the feedback for R was in the second position? Actually, no: the guess ""crane"" had R in position 2 and we learned that position 2 is wrong for R, but we don't know about position 2 for C? Actually, feedback is per letter.

 Actually, for the second guess, we need to avoid putting C in the first position and R in the second? Not necessarily: we know that in the secret word, C is not at position 1 and R is not at position 2. Therefore, in the new guess, we can put C at position 1? But wait: we know the secret word has C but not at position 1, so in our new guess, we should avoid using C at position 1? Actually, we can put C at position 1 in a guess? But we know it would be incorrect? However, if we put it elsewhere, we might get it right.

 But the point is: we want to maximize information. We already know C is not at position 1. So we can try C in position 2, 3, 4, or 5? However, in the secret word, C must be in one of these positions. Similarly for R: not in position 2, so try in 1,3,4,5.

 But we cannot put C at position 1? Because we know it's wrong? Actually, we can put it at position 1, but we know that it won't be correct? However, if we put it elsewhere, we can test other positions.

 Since we want to find the correct positions, it's better to put C and R in positions we haven't tested with them.

 In the first guess, C was at 1 and R at 2. We now know those positions are wrong for them.

 So for the next guess, let's try C and R in different positions.

 Also, we need to avoid A, N, E.

 Let me think of words that contain C and R, without A, N, E, and that have C not at position 1 and R not at position 2.

 Possibilities:
 - Try having C at position 3 and R at position 4? Or C at 2 and R at 4? Etc.

 What words have C and R? And common letters.

 Let me try: words starting with S? Then we can have S at position 1, then maybe O at position 2? So: S? and then C and R?

 Example: ""SCORE"" -> but E is ruled out (we cannot use E because we know it's not in the word). Also, note that ""score"" has E? So avoid.

 How about ""SCORN""? -> but it has O? That's okay? But wait, we don't know if O is in the word? But also, N is ruled out? Yes, N was in the first guess and ruled out. So avoid N.

 So ""SCORN"" is not allowed because N is ruled out.

 Let's think: common consonants and vowels without A, E, N? 

 Vowels: O, I, U (and sometimes Y) ... so we can use O, I, U.

 So possibilities: 

 Option: ""CROWD"" -> but C at position 1? We know position 1 is wrong for C? So don't put C at position 1? 

 Actually, we know the secret word doesn't have C at position 1? So if we put a word starting with C, we know the feedback for the first letter will be '-' at best (meaning present but wrong position) if we get it right? But actually, if we put C at position 1 and the secret word has C, then the feedback would be '-' because the position is wrong? But the rules: if the letter is in the word and in the correct position, we get ✓. Otherwise, if present but wrong position, we get '-'. And if missing, we get x.

 Since we already know the secret word does not have C at position 1, then putting C at position 1 would yield '-'? And it wouldn't help? So it's better not to put C at position 1? Because we already know.

 Therefore, we should use C at a position that we haven't tried? So let's avoid position 1 for C? Similarly, avoid position 2 for R.

 So position 1: cannot be C? And we know it's not A, N, E? So we can choose any other letter? Let's pick a common letter like S.

 So guess: 
 Position 1: S (a new letter)
 Position 2: we could try O? Then 
 Position 3: C (to test C in position 3) -> but then R? 
 Where to put R? We cannot put at position 2? But we can put it at position 4? 

 Example: ""SOC R"" ... but we need a 5-letter word?

 Let me make ""S O C R ?"" -> we can add a consonant? But then the last letter? 

 How about ""SOCOR""? Not a word? 

 Another idea: ""SCROB""? Not a word.

 How about ""CORDS"" -> but C at position 1? Avoid.

 Another: ""CURDS"" -> C at 1? Avoid.

 Let me try putting C at 4 or 5.

 Word: ""B R I C"" ... but we don't know? We need R? And we must have R? So let's put R as well.

 Consider: ""PRICK"" -> P at position 1? Then R at position 2? But wait: R cannot be at position 2? Because we know the secret word has R not at position 2? So avoid.

 How about ""CRISP"" -> C at 1? and R at 2? Both positions we know are wrong? So this guess would have C at position 1 and R at position 2? Then we would expect feedback for C and R to be '-'? But that doesn't give new information? So it's inefficient? We should avoid.

 So let's try to have C not at 1 and R not at 2? And include two new letters? 

 For example: 
 Position 1: T (common letter)
 Position 2: O (common vowel? but the secret word might have O? We haven't tested O)
 Position 3: R (here we are trying R at position 3? which we haven't tried? and note: R cannot be at 2? so 3 is possible)
 Position 4: C (trying C at position 4? we haven't tried that)
 Position 5: ? ... what letter? We need a letter that isn't A, N, or E? And also not O? Maybe S? 

 Word: ""TORCS""? That is not common? Are there better words?

 Alternatively: ""ROCKS""? But R at 1 (which we don't know if it's allowed? it is because we only know R isn't at 2? and also R could be at 1?) -> but wait: we haven't tried R at 1? So it's valid? And C at 4? 
 However, R at 1? That's okay? Because we haven't tested R at position 1? So let me check: in the first guess, R was at position 2? That was tested and was wrong. So R could be at any position except 2? So including position 1? Similarly for C: we only know it cannot be at position 1? So we can try position 2? But wait: we didn't try C at position 2? Actually, we haven't tried C at other positions? So we can.

 So let me think of words with R at position 1? And C? And without A,N,E? And then another letter? 

 Words: 
 ""RICES"" -> but E is ruled out? So no.
 ""RICKS"" -> K is a letter?
 ""ROCKS"": 
   R at 1, O at 2, C at 3? K at 4? S at 5? But wait: we are putting C at position 3? and R at position 1? 
   We haven't tried R at position 1? So we can try? And C at 3? (we haven't tried C at 3?).

 However, note: since we know R is in the word but not position 2, and C is in the word but not position 1, we are free to try R at 1 or 3,4,5? and C at 2,3,4,5? (avoiding position 1).

 So ""ROCKS"" might be a candidate? But note: we are trying O and K? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has both R and C? and avoids E,A,N? And common? 

 I'm considering ""C R O W D"" -> but C at 1? Avoid.

 How about ""SHIRT""? But H and I? And no C? We must include C? Because we haven't tested whether C is at other positions? Actually, we do have to include C and R? Because they are present? 

 We know the secret word has both C and R? So our next guess must have both.

 So let me search for words with C and R? and without A, N, E? Also, 5 letters.

 Examples:
 - CROWD: NO because C at 1? 
 - CURRY: has U? But C at 1? 
 - CRYPT: C at 1? 
 - BROIL: no C? but has O and I? 

 I need to avoid C at 1? So how about starting with a different letter? 

 Let me try words that have R as first letter? 

 R and then ...? But the letter C must be somewhere.

 Words: 
 - ""R A C E S"" -> has A and E? Ruled out? 
 - ""R O C K S"" -> R(1), O(2), C(3), K(4), S(5) -> but O, K, S are untested? And this word avoids A, N, E? So ""ROCKS"" is valid.

 So ""ROCKS"": 
   Position 1: R -> but that's possible? Because we only know R isn't at 2? It could be at 1? 
   Position 2: O -> untested? 
   Position 3: C? But wait: the feedback for C was that it's present? but we haven't tested position 3? 
   Position 4: K and 5: S? 

 This is a valid guess? But note: the secret word does not have C? Actually, it does? But we know it's present? 

 Also, we are avoiding A, N, E? So ""ROCKS"" meets the criteria.

 Alternatively: ""CRISP"" has C at one? Avoid? 

 Another word: ""PORCH"": 
   P(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5)? 
   This has R at 3 (never tested) and C at 4 (never tested). Also, P, O, H are new? 
   And no A, N, E? 

 Also valid? 

 So between ""ROCKS"" and ""PORCH""? Both are good? 

 Another word: ""CROWD"" -> C at 1? Avoid? 

 Or ""TRICK"": 
   T(1), R(2) -> wait, R at 2? But we know the secret word has R not at position 2? So if we put R at 2, then the feedback would show '-'? Because it is present? But not at that position? So it wouldn't tell us anything? Because we already know that? So it's inefficient? 

 Therefore, avoid putting R at 2 and C at 1? So for R, avoid position 2? For C, avoid position 1? 

 In ""ROCKS"": R is at 1? That is okay? Because we don't know about position 1? Only that position 2 was wrong? So position 1 is a possibility? Similarly, in ""PORCH"", R is at 3 and C at 4? 

 But note: if we choose ""ROCKS"", we are putting R at 1 and C at 3? 

 How about we choose a word that uses more new letters? 

 We know the secret word has C and R? and three other letters? We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

 So let me choose a word that covers many common letters? 

 ""ROCKS"" tests R, O, C, K, S? 
 ""PORCH"" tests P, O, R, C, H? 

 Both are fine? I'll pick ""ROCKS"" because it has S at the end? Which is common? 

 But wait: in the next guess, if we get feedback for these, we might learn more? 

 Actually, let me double-check: we know the secret word has C and R? So we want to test positions? 

 Alternatively, we could try a word that has R not at 1? And C not at 1? So let me try putting R near the middle? 

 Example: ""STRIP"" -> has S, T, R, I, P? But missing C? We must include C? 

 How about ""SCR?"" ... ""SCRIP""? S(1), C(2), R(3), I(4), P(5)? This has C at position 2? and R at position 3? 
 And avoids A,N,E? 

 So ""SCRIP"" is a word? Yes? Meaning: a small piece? 

 This avoids the known bad positions? 
 For C: we tried position 1 before? Now position 2? And R was tried at position 2? Now position 3? 

 Also, using S, C, R, I, P? All new letters? 

 So feedback would tell us:
 - If C is at position 2: it would be ✓? Or if it's elsewhere? 
 But we know that the secret word has C? So if it's at position 2? We'll know? Similarly, R? 

 Both ""SCRIP"" and ""ROCKS"" are valid? 

 But note: we haven't tested S? So it's also informative? 

 However, in ""SCRIP"": 
   Position 1: S? 
   Position 2: C? -> testing C at 2? 
   Position 3: R? -> testing R at 3? 
   Position 4: I? 
   Position 5: P?

 Alternatively, we could use ""CRWTH""? But that's not common? 

 Let me go with ""SCRIP"". 

 But note: we must not include letters that are ruled out? So ""SCRIP"" is okay? 

 Another candidate: ""BROCK"" -> but O and K? And R at 2? Avoid R at 2? 

 Actually, ""BROCK"" has R at position 2? So avoid.

 So I think ""SCRIP"" is a good choice? 

 Alternatively, ""PORCH"" is also good? 

 But ""PORCH"" doesn't have a new vowel? We have O? But both SCRIP and PORCH have O? Actually, SCRIP has I? 

 Which letters have we tested? In the first guess: C,R,A,N,E? So we tested A (vowel) and E (vowel)? So remaining vowels: O, I, U? We haven't tested any? So it is good to test one? 

 ""SCRIP"" has I? which is a common vowel? 

 So I choose ""SCRIP"".

 However, note: the feedback might be:
  If the secret word has S? We don't know? So we'll get information? 

 So my guess is ""SCRIP"".

 Let me write it: <guess>scrip</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is present in the word but not in position 1 (as indicated by ""-"")
- R is present but not in position 2
- Letters A, N, and E are absent (as indicated by ""x"")
- The secret word contains C and R, but excludes A, N, and E.

For the second guess, I aim to:
1. Include C and R (since they are in the word)
2. Avoid positions for C and R where they are known to be incorrect:
   - C cannot be in position 1
   - R cannot be in position 2
3. Test new common letters not previously used (e.g., avoid A, N, E) to maximize information.

After evaluating possibilities, ""scrip"" is a strong candidate:
- Places C at position 2 (a new plausible position)
- Places R at position 3 (new position, escaping position 2)
- Uses new letters S, I, P to cover untested consonants and vowels
- Avoids excluded letters and inefficient placements

<guess>scrip</guess>",scrip,"We are given the feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(-), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is in the word but not in the first position (since the feedback for the first letter C is '-', meaning wrong position).
 - R is in the word but not in the second position.
 - A, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, we know:
 The secret word contains the letters C and R, but not A, N, or E.
 The letter C cannot be in the first position, and R cannot be in the second position.

 Now, we need to make a second guess.

 Constraints for the next guess:
 1. Must be a 5-letter English word.
 2. Must include C and R (since they are in the secret word) and avoid A, N, E.
 3. Also, the positions of C and R should not be the same as in the first guess (i.e., not position 1 for C and not position 2 for R) because that would be the same incorrect positions.

 We have 3 other positions to consider (3rd, 4th, 5th) and 2 letters (C and R) to place in positions that are not their original ones? Actually, note that the feedback says the letters are in the word but in the wrong position, so they must appear in new positions.

 Additionally, we have three other letters to choose for the remaining three positions. We should try to use common letters that haven't been tried yet (since A, N, E are eliminated).

 Since the word does not contain A, N, or E, we can use other vowels and consonants.

 Common vowels: I, O, U (but note that we must avoid A and E, so O and U are possibilities, and sometimes Y? But Y is less common).

 However, note that the secret word has five letters and we know two of them: C and R. The other three are unknown.

 We can try a word that uses C and R in different positions and also tests some new letters.

 Possible approach: Place C and R in positions that are not 1 and 2. And use new common letters.

 Example placements:
 Let's avoid having the same positions for C and R. So:
 - We shouldn't put C at position 1 (as before) and we shouldn't put R at position 2.

 We can try:
 Option 1: Place C in position 2? -> But note: the feedback for R was in the second position? Actually, no: the guess ""crane"" had R in position 2 and we learned that position 2 is wrong for R, but we don't know about position 2 for C? Actually, feedback is per letter.

 Actually, for the second guess, we need to avoid putting C in the first position and R in the second? Not necessarily: we know that in the secret word, C is not at position 1 and R is not at position 2. Therefore, in the new guess, we can put C at position 1? But wait: we know the secret word has C but not at position 1, so in our new guess, we should avoid using C at position 1? Actually, we can put C at position 1 in a guess? But we know it would be incorrect? However, if we put it elsewhere, we might get it right.

 But the point is: we want to maximize information. We already know C is not at position 1. So we can try C in position 2, 3, 4, or 5? However, in the secret word, C must be in one of these positions. Similarly for R: not in position 2, so try in 1,3,4,5.

 But we cannot put C at position 1? Because we know it's wrong? Actually, we can put it at position 1, but we know that it won't be correct? However, if we put it elsewhere, we can test other positions.

 Since we want to find the correct positions, it's better to put C and R in positions we haven't tested with them.

 In the first guess, C was at 1 and R at 2. We now know those positions are wrong for them.

 So for the next guess, let's try C and R in different positions.

 Also, we need to avoid A, N, E.

 Let me think of words that contain C and R, without A, N, E, and that have C not at position 1 and R not at position 2.

 Possibilities:
 - Try having C at position 3 and R at position 4? Or C at 2 and R at 4? Etc.

 What words have C and R? And common letters.

 Let me try: words starting with S? Then we can have S at position 1, then maybe O at position 2? So: S? and then C and R?

 Example: ""SCORE"" -> but E is ruled out (we cannot use E because we know it's not in the word). Also, note that ""score"" has E? So avoid.

 How about ""SCORN""? -> but it has O? That's okay? But wait, we don't know if O is in the word? But also, N is ruled out? Yes, N was in the first guess and ruled out. So avoid N.

 So ""SCORN"" is not allowed because N is ruled out.

 Let's think: common consonants and vowels without A, E, N? 

 Vowels: O, I, U (and sometimes Y) ... so we can use O, I, U.

 So possibilities: 

 Option: ""CROWD"" -> but C at position 1? We know position 1 is wrong for C? So don't put C at position 1? 

 Actually, we know the secret word doesn't have C at position 1? So if we put a word starting with C, we know the feedback for the first letter will be '-' at best (meaning present but wrong position) if we get it right? But actually, if we put C at position 1 and the secret word has C, then the feedback would be '-' because the position is wrong? But the rules: if the letter is in the word and in the correct position, we get ✓. Otherwise, if present but wrong position, we get '-'. And if missing, we get x.

 Since we already know the secret word does not have C at position 1, then putting C at position 1 would yield '-'? And it wouldn't help? So it's better not to put C at position 1? Because we already know.

 Therefore, we should use C at a position that we haven't tried? So let's avoid position 1 for C? Similarly, avoid position 2 for R.

 So position 1: cannot be C? And we know it's not A, N, E? So we can choose any other letter? Let's pick a common letter like S.

 So guess: 
 Position 1: S (a new letter)
 Position 2: we could try O? Then 
 Position 3: C (to test C in position 3) -> but then R? 
 Where to put R? We cannot put at position 2? But we can put it at position 4? 

 Example: ""SOC R"" ... but we need a 5-letter word?

 Let me make ""S O C R ?"" -> we can add a consonant? But then the last letter? 

 How about ""SOCOR""? Not a word? 

 Another idea: ""SCROB""? Not a word.

 How about ""CORDS"" -> but C at position 1? Avoid.

 Another: ""CURDS"" -> C at 1? Avoid.

 Let me try putting C at 4 or 5.

 Word: ""B R I C"" ... but we don't know? We need R? And we must have R? So let's put R as well.

 Consider: ""PRICK"" -> P at position 1? Then R at position 2? But wait: R cannot be at position 2? Because we know the secret word has R not at position 2? So avoid.

 How about ""CRISP"" -> C at 1? and R at 2? Both positions we know are wrong? So this guess would have C at position 1 and R at position 2? Then we would expect feedback for C and R to be '-'? But that doesn't give new information? So it's inefficient? We should avoid.

 So let's try to have C not at 1 and R not at 2? And include two new letters? 

 For example: 
 Position 1: T (common letter)
 Position 2: O (common vowel? but the secret word might have O? We haven't tested O)
 Position 3: R (here we are trying R at position 3? which we haven't tried? and note: R cannot be at 2? so 3 is possible)
 Position 4: C (trying C at position 4? we haven't tried that)
 Position 5: ? ... what letter? We need a letter that isn't A, N, or E? And also not O? Maybe S? 

 Word: ""TORCS""? That is not common? Are there better words?

 Alternatively: ""ROCKS""? But R at 1 (which we don't know if it's allowed? it is because we only know R isn't at 2? and also R could be at 1?) -> but wait: we haven't tried R at 1? So it's valid? And C at 4? 
 However, R at 1? That's okay? Because we haven't tested R at position 1? So let me check: in the first guess, R was at position 2? That was tested and was wrong. So R could be at any position except 2? So including position 1? Similarly for C: we only know it cannot be at position 1? So we can try position 2? But wait: we didn't try C at position 2? Actually, we haven't tried C at other positions? So we can.

 So let me think of words with R at position 1? And C? And without A,N,E? And then another letter? 

 Words: 
 ""RICES"" -> but E is ruled out? So no.
 ""RICKS"" -> K is a letter?
 ""ROCKS"": 
   R at 1, O at 2, C at 3? K at 4? S at 5? But wait: we are putting C at position 3? and R at position 1? 
   We haven't tried R at position 1? So we can try? And C at 3? (we haven't tried C at 3?).

 However, note: since we know R is in the word but not position 2, and C is in the word but not position 1, we are free to try R at 1 or 3,4,5? and C at 2,3,4,5? (avoiding position 1).

 So ""ROCKS"" might be a candidate? But note: we are trying O and K? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has both R and C? and avoids E,A,N? And common? 

 I'm considering ""C R O W D"" -> but C at 1? Avoid.

 How about ""SHIRT""? But H and I? And no C? We must include C? Because we haven't tested whether C is at other positions? Actually, we do have to include C and R? Because they are present? 

 We know the secret word has both C and R? So our next guess must have both.

 So let me search for words with C and R? and without A, N, E? Also, 5 letters.

 Examples:
 - CROWD: NO because C at 1? 
 - CURRY: has U? But C at 1? 
 - CRYPT: C at 1? 
 - BROIL: no C? but has O and I? 

 I need to avoid C at 1? So how about starting with a different letter? 

 Let me try words that have R as first letter? 

 R and then ...? But the letter C must be somewhere.

 Words: 
 - ""R A C E S"" -> has A and E? Ruled out? 
 - ""R O C K S"" -> R(1), O(2), C(3), K(4), S(5) -> but O, K, S are untested? And this word avoids A, N, E? So ""ROCKS"" is valid.

 So ""ROCKS"": 
   Position 1: R -> but that's possible? Because we only know R isn't at 2? It could be at 1? 
   Position 2: O -> untested? 
   Position 3: C? But wait: the feedback for C was that it's present? but we haven't tested position 3? 
   Position 4: K and 5: S? 

 This is a valid guess? But note: the secret word does not have C? Actually, it does? But we know it's present? 

 Also, we are avoiding A, N, E? So ""ROCKS"" meets the criteria.

 Alternatively: ""CRISP"" has C at one? Avoid? 

 Another word: ""PORCH"": 
   P(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5)? 
   This has R at 3 (never tested) and C at 4 (never tested). Also, P, O, H are new? 
   And no A, N, E? 

 Also valid? 

 So between ""ROCKS"" and ""PORCH""? Both are good? 

 Another word: ""CROWD"" -> C at 1? Avoid? 

 Or ""TRICK"": 
   T(1), R(2) -> wait, R at 2? But we know the secret word has R not at position 2? So if we put R at 2, then the feedback would show '-'? Because it is present? But not at that position? So it wouldn't tell us anything? Because we already know that? So it's inefficient? 

 Therefore, avoid putting R at 2 and C at 1? So for R, avoid position 2? For C, avoid position 1? 

 In ""ROCKS"": R is at 1? That is okay? Because we don't know about position 1? Only that position 2 was wrong? So position 1 is a possibility? Similarly, in ""PORCH"", R is at 3 and C at 4? 

 But note: if we choose ""ROCKS"", we are putting R at 1 and C at 3? 

 How about we choose a word that uses more new letters? 

 We know the secret word has C and R? and three other letters? We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

 So let me choose a word that covers many common letters? 

 ""ROCKS"" tests R, O, C, K, S? 
 ""PORCH"" tests P, O, R, C, H? 

 Both are fine? I'll pick ""ROCKS"" because it has S at the end? Which is common? 

 But wait: in the next guess, if we get feedback for these, we might learn more? 

 Actually, let me double-check: we know the secret word has C and R? So we want to test positions? 

 Alternatively, we could try a word that has R not at 1? And C not at 1? So let me try putting R near the middle? 

 Example: ""STRIP"" -> has S, T, R, I, P? But missing C? We must include C? 

 How about ""SCR?"" ... ""SCRIP""? S(1), C(2), R(3), I(4), P(5)? This has C at position 2? and R at position 3? 
 And avoids A,N,E? 

 So ""SCRIP"" is a word? Yes? Meaning: a small piece? 

 This avoids the known bad positions? 
 For C: we tried position 1 before? Now position 2? And R was tried at position 2? Now position 3? 

 Also, using S, C, R, I, P? All new letters? 

 So feedback would tell us:
 - If C is at position 2: it would be ✓? Or if it's elsewhere? 
 But we know that the secret word has C? So if it's at position 2? We'll know? Similarly, R? 

 Both ""SCRIP"" and ""ROCKS"" are valid? 

 But note: we haven't tested S? So it's also informative? 

 However, in ""SCRIP"": 
   Position 1: S? 
   Position 2: C? -> testing C at 2? 
   Position 3: R? -> testing R at 3? 
   Position 4: I? 
   Position 5: P?

 Alternatively, we could use ""CRWTH""? But that's not common? 

 Let me go with ""SCRIP"". 

 But note: we must not include letters that are ruled out? So ""SCRIP"" is okay? 

 Another candidate: ""BROCK"" -> but O and K? And R at 2? Avoid R at 2? 

 Actually, ""BROCK"" has R at position 2? So avoid.

 So I think ""SCRIP"" is a good choice? 

 Alternatively, ""PORCH"" is also good? 

 But ""PORCH"" doesn't have a new vowel? We have O? But both SCRIP and PORCH have O? Actually, SCRIP has I? 

 Which letters have we tested? In the first guess: C,R,A,N,E? So we tested A (vowel) and E (vowel)? So remaining vowels: O, I, U? We haven't tested any? So it is good to test one? 

 ""SCRIP"" has I? which is a common vowel? 

 So I choose ""SCRIP"".

 However, note: the feedback might be:
  If the secret word has S? We don't know? So we'll get information? 

 So my guess is ""SCRIP"".

 Let me write it: <guess>scrip</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is present in the word but not in position 1 (as indicated by ""-"")
- R is present but not in position 2
- Letters A, N, and E are absent (as indicated by ""x"")
- The secret word contains C and R, but excludes A, N, and E.

For the second guess, I aim to:
1. Include C and R (since they are in the word)
2. Avoid positions for C and R where they are known to be incorrect:
   - C cannot be in position 1
   - R cannot be in position 2
3. Test new common letters not previously used (e.g., avoid A, N, E) to maximize information.

After evaluating possibilities, ""scrip"" is a strong candidate:
- Places C at position 2 (a new plausible position)
- Places R at position 3 (new position, escaping position 2)
- Uses new letters S, I, P to cover untested consonants and vowels
- Avoids excluded letters and inefficient placements",Guess 2: scrip -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(-) R(✓) I(x) P(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,porch,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(-), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is in the word but not in the first position (since the feedback for the first letter C is '-', meaning wrong position).
 - R is in the word but not in the second position.
 - A, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, we know:
 The secret word contains the letters C and R, but not A, N, or E.
 The letter C cannot be in the first position, and R cannot be in the second position.

 Now, we need to make a second guess.

 Constraints for the next guess:
 1. Must be a 5-letter English word.
 2. Must include C and R (since they are in the secret word) and avoid A, N, E.
 3. Also, the positions of C and R should not be the same as in the first guess (i.e., not position 1 for C and not position 2 for R) because that would be the same incorrect positions.

 We have 3 other positions to consider (3rd, 4th, 5th) and 2 letters (C and R) to place in positions that are not their original ones? Actually, note that the feedback says the letters are in the word but in the wrong position, so they must appear in new positions.

 Additionally, we have three other letters to choose for the remaining three positions. We should try to use common letters that haven't been tried yet (since A, N, E are eliminated).

 Since the word does not contain A, N, or E, we can use other vowels and consonants.

 Common vowels: I, O, U (but note that we must avoid A and E, so O and U are possibilities, and sometimes Y? But Y is less common).

 However, note that the secret word has five letters and we know two of them: C and R. The other three are unknown.

 We can try a word that uses C and R in different positions and also tests some new letters.

 Possible approach: Place C and R in positions that are not 1 and 2. And use new common letters.

 Example placements:
 Let's avoid having the same positions for C and R. So:
 - We shouldn't put C at position 1 (as before) and we shouldn't put R at position 2.

 We can try:
 Option 1: Place C in position 2? -> But note: the feedback for R was in the second position? Actually, no: the guess ""crane"" had R in position 2 and we learned that position 2 is wrong for R, but we don't know about position 2 for C? Actually, feedback is per letter.

 Actually, for the second guess, we need to avoid putting C in the first position and R in the second? Not necessarily: we know that in the secret word, C is not at position 1 and R is not at position 2. Therefore, in the new guess, we can put C at position 1? But wait: we know the secret word has C but not at position 1, so in our new guess, we should avoid using C at position 1? Actually, we can put C at position 1 in a guess? But we know it would be incorrect? However, if we put it elsewhere, we might get it right.

 But the point is: we want to maximize information. We already know C is not at position 1. So we can try C in position 2, 3, 4, or 5? However, in the secret word, C must be in one of these positions. Similarly for R: not in position 2, so try in 1,3,4,5.

 But we cannot put C at position 1? Because we know it's wrong? Actually, we can put it at position 1, but we know that it won't be correct? However, if we put it elsewhere, we can test other positions.

 Since we want to find the correct positions, it's better to put C and R in positions we haven't tested with them.

 In the first guess, C was at 1 and R at 2. We now know those positions are wrong for them.

 So for the next guess, let's try C and R in different positions.

 Also, we need to avoid A, N, E.

 Let me think of words that contain C and R, without A, N, E, and that have C not at position 1 and R not at position 2.

 Possibilities:
 - Try having C at position 3 and R at position 4? Or C at 2 and R at 4? Etc.

 What words have C and R? And common letters.

 Let me try: words starting with S? Then we can have S at position 1, then maybe O at position 2? So: S? and then C and R?

 Example: ""SCORE"" -> but E is ruled out (we cannot use E because we know it's not in the word). Also, note that ""score"" has E? So avoid.

 How about ""SCORN""? -> but it has O? That's okay? But wait, we don't know if O is in the word? But also, N is ruled out? Yes, N was in the first guess and ruled out. So avoid N.

 So ""SCORN"" is not allowed because N is ruled out.

 Let's think: common consonants and vowels without A, E, N? 

 Vowels: O, I, U (and sometimes Y) ... so we can use O, I, U.

 So possibilities: 

 Option: ""CROWD"" -> but C at position 1? We know position 1 is wrong for C? So don't put C at position 1? 

 Actually, we know the secret word doesn't have C at position 1? So if we put a word starting with C, we know the feedback for the first letter will be '-' at best (meaning present but wrong position) if we get it right? But actually, if we put C at position 1 and the secret word has C, then the feedback would be '-' because the position is wrong? But the rules: if the letter is in the word and in the correct position, we get ✓. Otherwise, if present but wrong position, we get '-'. And if missing, we get x.

 Since we already know the secret word does not have C at position 1, then putting C at position 1 would yield '-'? And it wouldn't help? So it's better not to put C at position 1? Because we already know.

 Therefore, we should use C at a position that we haven't tried? So let's avoid position 1 for C? Similarly, avoid position 2 for R.

 So position 1: cannot be C? And we know it's not A, N, E? So we can choose any other letter? Let's pick a common letter like S.

 So guess: 
 Position 1: S (a new letter)
 Position 2: we could try O? Then 
 Position 3: C (to test C in position 3) -> but then R? 
 Where to put R? We cannot put at position 2? But we can put it at position 4? 

 Example: ""SOC R"" ... but we need a 5-letter word?

 Let me make ""S O C R ?"" -> we can add a consonant? But then the last letter? 

 How about ""SOCOR""? Not a word? 

 Another idea: ""SCROB""? Not a word.

 How about ""CORDS"" -> but C at position 1? Avoid.

 Another: ""CURDS"" -> C at 1? Avoid.

 Let me try putting C at 4 or 5.

 Word: ""B R I C"" ... but we don't know? We need R? And we must have R? So let's put R as well.

 Consider: ""PRICK"" -> P at position 1? Then R at position 2? But wait: R cannot be at position 2? Because we know the secret word has R not at position 2? So avoid.

 How about ""CRISP"" -> C at 1? and R at 2? Both positions we know are wrong? So this guess would have C at position 1 and R at position 2? Then we would expect feedback for C and R to be '-'? But that doesn't give new information? So it's inefficient? We should avoid.

 So let's try to have C not at 1 and R not at 2? And include two new letters? 

 For example: 
 Position 1: T (common letter)
 Position 2: O (common vowel? but the secret word might have O? We haven't tested O)
 Position 3: R (here we are trying R at position 3? which we haven't tried? and note: R cannot be at 2? so 3 is possible)
 Position 4: C (trying C at position 4? we haven't tried that)
 Position 5: ? ... what letter? We need a letter that isn't A, N, or E? And also not O? Maybe S? 

 Word: ""TORCS""? That is not common? Are there better words?

 Alternatively: ""ROCKS""? But R at 1 (which we don't know if it's allowed? it is because we only know R isn't at 2? and also R could be at 1?) -> but wait: we haven't tried R at 1? So it's valid? And C at 4? 
 However, R at 1? That's okay? Because we haven't tested R at position 1? So let me check: in the first guess, R was at position 2? That was tested and was wrong. So R could be at any position except 2? So including position 1? Similarly for C: we only know it cannot be at position 1? So we can try position 2? But wait: we didn't try C at position 2? Actually, we haven't tried C at other positions? So we can.

 So let me think of words with R at position 1? And C? And without A,N,E? And then another letter? 

 Words: 
 ""RICES"" -> but E is ruled out? So no.
 ""RICKS"" -> K is a letter?
 ""ROCKS"": 
   R at 1, O at 2, C at 3? K at 4? S at 5? But wait: we are putting C at position 3? and R at position 1? 
   We haven't tried R at position 1? So we can try? And C at 3? (we haven't tried C at 3?).

 However, note: since we know R is in the word but not position 2, and C is in the word but not position 1, we are free to try R at 1 or 3,4,5? and C at 2,3,4,5? (avoiding position 1).

 So ""ROCKS"" might be a candidate? But note: we are trying O and K? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has both R and C? and avoids E,A,N? And common? 

 I'm considering ""C R O W D"" -> but C at 1? Avoid.

 How about ""SHIRT""? But H and I? And no C? We must include C? Because we haven't tested whether C is at other positions? Actually, we do have to include C and R? Because they are present? 

 We know the secret word has both C and R? So our next guess must have both.

 So let me search for words with C and R? and without A, N, E? Also, 5 letters.

 Examples:
 - CROWD: NO because C at 1? 
 - CURRY: has U? But C at 1? 
 - CRYPT: C at 1? 
 - BROIL: no C? but has O and I? 

 I need to avoid C at 1? So how about starting with a different letter? 

 Let me try words that have R as first letter? 

 R and then ...? But the letter C must be somewhere.

 Words: 
 - ""R A C E S"" -> has A and E? Ruled out? 
 - ""R O C K S"" -> R(1), O(2), C(3), K(4), S(5) -> but O, K, S are untested? And this word avoids A, N, E? So ""ROCKS"" is valid.

 So ""ROCKS"": 
   Position 1: R -> but that's possible? Because we only know R isn't at 2? It could be at 1? 
   Position 2: O -> untested? 
   Position 3: C? But wait: the feedback for C was that it's present? but we haven't tested position 3? 
   Position 4: K and 5: S? 

 This is a valid guess? But note: the secret word does not have C? Actually, it does? But we know it's present? 

 Also, we are avoiding A, N, E? So ""ROCKS"" meets the criteria.

 Alternatively: ""CRISP"" has C at one? Avoid? 

 Another word: ""PORCH"": 
   P(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5)? 
   This has R at 3 (never tested) and C at 4 (never tested). Also, P, O, H are new? 
   And no A, N, E? 

 Also valid? 

 So between ""ROCKS"" and ""PORCH""? Both are good? 

 Another word: ""CROWD"" -> C at 1? Avoid? 

 Or ""TRICK"": 
   T(1), R(2) -> wait, R at 2? But we know the secret word has R not at position 2? So if we put R at 2, then the feedback would show '-'? Because it is present? But not at that position? So it wouldn't tell us anything? Because we already know that? So it's inefficient? 

 Therefore, avoid putting R at 2 and C at 1? So for R, avoid position 2? For C, avoid position 1? 

 In ""ROCKS"": R is at 1? That is okay? Because we don't know about position 1? Only that position 2 was wrong? So position 1 is a possibility? Similarly, in ""PORCH"", R is at 3 and C at 4? 

 But note: if we choose ""ROCKS"", we are putting R at 1 and C at 3? 

 How about we choose a word that uses more new letters? 

 We know the secret word has C and R? and three other letters? We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

 So let me choose a word that covers many common letters? 

 ""ROCKS"" tests R, O, C, K, S? 
 ""PORCH"" tests P, O, R, C, H? 

 Both are fine? I'll pick ""ROCKS"" because it has S at the end? Which is common? 

 But wait: in the next guess, if we get feedback for these, we might learn more? 

 Actually, let me double-check: we know the secret word has C and R? So we want to test positions? 

 Alternatively, we could try a word that has R not at 1? And C not at 1? So let me try putting R near the middle? 

 Example: ""STRIP"" -> has S, T, R, I, P? But missing C? We must include C? 

 How about ""SCR?"" ... ""SCRIP""? S(1), C(2), R(3), I(4), P(5)? This has C at position 2? and R at position 3? 
 And avoids A,N,E? 

 So ""SCRIP"" is a word? Yes? Meaning: a small piece? 

 This avoids the known bad positions? 
 For C: we tried position 1 before? Now position 2? And R was tried at position 2? Now position 3? 

 Also, using S, C, R, I, P? All new letters? 

 So feedback would tell us:
 - If C is at position 2: it would be ✓? Or if it's elsewhere? 
 But we know that the secret word has C? So if it's at position 2? We'll know? Similarly, R? 

 Both ""SCRIP"" and ""ROCKS"" are valid? 

 But note: we haven't tested S? So it's also informative? 

 However, in ""SCRIP"": 
   Position 1: S? 
   Position 2: C? -> testing C at 2? 
   Position 3: R? -> testing R at 3? 
   Position 4: I? 
   Position 5: P?

 Alternatively, we could use ""CRWTH""? But that's not common? 

 Let me go with ""SCRIP"". 

 But note: we must not include letters that are ruled out? So ""SCRIP"" is okay? 

 Another candidate: ""BROCK"" -> but O and K? And R at 2? Avoid R at 2? 

 Actually, ""BROCK"" has R at position 2? So avoid.

 So I think ""SCRIP"" is a good choice? 

 Alternatively, ""PORCH"" is also good? 

 But ""PORCH"" doesn't have a new vowel? We have O? But both SCRIP and PORCH have O? Actually, SCRIP has I? 

 Which letters have we tested? In the first guess: C,R,A,N,E? So we tested A (vowel) and E (vowel)? So remaining vowels: O, I, U? We haven't tested any? So it is good to test one? 

 ""SCRIP"" has I? which is a common vowel? 

 So I choose ""SCRIP"".

 However, note: the feedback might be:
  If the secret word has S? We don't know? So we'll get information? 

 So my guess is ""SCRIP"".

 Let me write it: <guess>scrip</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is present in the word but not in position 1 (as indicated by ""-"")
- R is present but not in position 2
- Letters A, N, and E are absent (as indicated by ""x"")
- The secret word contains C and R, but excludes A, N, and E.

For the second guess, I aim to:
1. Include C and R (since they are in the word)
2. Avoid positions for C and R where they are known to be incorrect:
   - C cannot be in position 1
   - R cannot be in position 2
3. Test new common letters not previously used (e.g., avoid A, N, E) to maximize information.

After evaluating possibilities, ""scrip"" is a strong candidate:
- Places C at position 2 (a new plausible position)
- Places R at position 3 (new position, escaping position 2)
- Uses new letters S, I, P to cover untested consonants and vowels
- Avoids excluded letters and inefficient placements

Must be a 5-letter English word.\n 2. Must include C and R (since they are in the secret word) and avoid A, N, E.\n 3. Also, the positions of C and R should not be the same as in the first guess (i.e., not position 1 for C and not position 2 for R) because that would be the same incorrect positions.\n\n We have 3 other positions to consider (3rd, 4th, 5th) and 2 letters (C and R) to place in positions that are not their original ones? Actually, note that the feedback says the letters are in the word but in the wrong position, so they must appear in new positions.\n\n Additionally, we have three other letters to choose for the remaining three positions. We should try to use common letters that haven\'t been tried yet (since A, N, E are eliminated).\n\n Since the word does not contain A, N, or E, we can use other vowels and consonants.\n\n Common vowels: I, O, U (but note that we must avoid A and E, so O and U are possibilities, and sometimes Y? But Y is less common).\n\n However, note that the secret word has five letters and we know two of them: C and R. The other three are unknown.\n\n We can try a word that uses C and R in different positions and also tests some new letters.\n\n Possible approach: Place C and R in positions that are not 1 and 2. And use new common letters.\n\n Example placements:\n Let\'s avoid having the same positions for C and R. So:\n - We shouldn\'t put C at position 1 (as before) and we shouldn\'t put R at position 2.\n\n We can try:\n Option 1: Place C in position 2? -> But note: the feedback for R was in the second position? Actually, no: the guess ""crane"" had R in position 2 and we learned that position 2 is wrong for R, but we don\'t know about position 2 for C? Actually, feedback is per letter.\n\n Actually, for the second guess, we need to avoid putting C in the first position and R in the second? Not necessarily: we know that in the secret word, C is not at position 1 and R is not at position 2. Therefore, in the new guess, we can put C at position 1? But wait: we know the secret word has C but not at position 1, so in our new guess, we should avoid using C at position 1? Actually, we can put C at position 1 in a guess? But we know it would be incorrect? However, if we put it elsewhere, we might get it right.\n\n But the point is: we want to maximize information. We already know C is not at position 1. So we can try C in position 2, 3, 4, or 5? However, in the secret word, C must be in one of these positions. Similarly for R: not in position 2, so try in 1,3,4,5.\n\n But we cannot put C at position 1? Because we know it\'s wrong? Actually, we can put it at position 1, but we know that it won\'t be correct? However, if we put it elsewhere, we can test other positions.\n\n Since we want to find the correct positions, it\'s better to put C and R in positions we haven\'t tested with them.\n\n In the first guess, C was at 1 and R at 2. We now know those positions are wrong for them.\n\n So for the next guess, let\'s try C and R in different positions.\n\n Also, we need to avoid A, N, E.\n\n Let me think of words that contain C and R, without A, N, E, and that have C not at position 1 and R not at position 2.\n\n Possibilities:\n - Try having C at position 3 and R at position 4? Or C at 2 and R at 4? Etc.\n\n What words have C and R? And common letters.\n\n Let me try: words starting with S? Then we can have S at position 1, then maybe O at position 2? So: S? and then C and R?\n\n Example: ""SCORE"" -> but E is ruled out (we cannot use E because we know it\'s not in the word). Also, note that ""score"" has E? So avoid.\n\n How about ""SCORN""? -> but it has O? That\'s okay? But wait, we don\'t know if O is in the word? But also, N is ruled out? Yes, N was in the first guess and ruled out. So avoid N.\n\n So ""SCORN"" is not allowed because N is ruled out.\n\n Let\'s think: common consonants and vowels without A, E, N? \n\n Vowels: O, I, U (and sometimes Y) ... so we can use O, I, U.\n\n So possibilities: \n\n Option: ""CROWD"" -> but C at position 1? We know position 1 is wrong for C? So don\'t put C at position 1? \n\n Actually, we know the secret word doesn\'t have C at position 1? So if we put a word starting with C, we know the feedback for the first letter will be \'-\' at best (meaning present but wrong position) if we get it right? But actually, if we put C at position 1 and the secret word has C, then the feedback would be \'-\' because the position is wrong? But the rules: if the letter is in the word and in the correct position, we get ✓. Otherwise, if present but wrong position, we get \'-\'. And if missing, we get x.\n\n Since we already know the secret word does not have C at position 1, then putting C at position 1 would yield \'-\'? And it wouldn\'t help? So it\'s better not to put C at position 1? Because we already know.\n\n Therefore, we should use C at a position that we haven\'t tried? So let\'s avoid position 1 for C? Similarly, avoid position 2 for R.\n\n So position 1: cannot be C? And we know it\'s not A, N, E? So we can choose any other letter? Let\'s pick a common letter like S.\n\n So guess: \n Position 1: S (a new letter)\n Position 2: we could try O? Then \n Position 3: C (to test C in position 3) -> but then R? \n Where to put R? We cannot put at position 2? But we can put it at position 4? \n\n Example: ""SOC R"" ... but we need a 5-letter word?\n\n Let me make ""S O C R ?"" -> we can add a consonant? But then the last letter? \n\n How about ""SOCOR""? Not a word? \n\n Another idea: ""SCROB""? Not a word.\n\n How about ""CORDS"" -> but C at position 1? Avoid.\n\n Another: ""CURDS"" -> C at 1? Avoid.\n\n Let me try putting C at 4 or 5.\n\n Word: ""B R I C"" ... but we don\'t know? We need R? And we must have R? So let\'s put R as well.\n\n Consider: ""PRICK"" -> P at position 1? Then R at position 2? But wait: R cannot be at position 2? Because we know the secret word has R not at position 2? So avoid.\n\n How about ""CRISP"" -> C at 1? and R at 2? Both positions we know are wrong? So this guess would have C at position 1 and R at position 2? Then we would expect feedback for C and R to be \'-\'? But that doesn\'t give new information? So it\'s inefficient? We should avoid.\n\n So let\'s try to have C not at 1 and R not at 2? And include two new letters? \n\n For example: \n Position 1: T (common letter)\n Position 2: O (common vowel? but the secret word might have O? We haven\'t tested O)\n Position 3: R (here we are trying R at position 3? which we haven\'t tried? and note: R cannot be at 2? so 3 is possible)\n Position 4: C (trying C at position 4? we haven\'t tried that)\n Position 5: ? ... what letter? We need a letter that isn\'t A, N, or E? And also not O? Maybe S? \n\n Word: ""TORCS""? That is not common? Are there better words?\n\n Alternatively: ""ROCKS""? But R at 1 (which we don\'t know if it\'s allowed? it is because we only know R isn\'t at 2? and also R could be at 1?) -> but wait: we haven\'t tried R at 1? So it\'s valid? And C at 4? \n However, R at 1? That\'s okay? Because we haven\'t tested R at position 1? So let me check: in the first guess, R was at position 2? That was tested and was wrong. So R could be at any position except 2? So including position 1? Similarly for C: we only know it cannot be at position 1? So we can try position 2? But wait: we didn\'t try C at position 2? Actually, we haven\'t tried C at other positions? So we can.\n\n So let me think of words with R at position 1? And C? And without A,N,E? And then another letter? \n\n Words: \n ""RICES"" -> but E is ruled out? So no.\n ""RICKS"" -> K is a letter?\n ""ROCKS"": \n   R at 1, O at 2, C at 3? K at 4? S at 5? But wait: we are putting C at position 3? and R at position 1? \n   We haven\'t tried R at position 1? So we can try? And C at 3? (we haven\'t tried C at 3?).\n\n However, note: since we know R is in the word but not position 2, and C is in the word but not position 1, we are free to try R at 1 or 3,4,5? and C at 2,3,4,5? (avoiding position 1).\n\n So ""ROCKS"" might be a candidate? But note: we are trying O and K? \n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has both R and C? and avoids E,A,N? And common? \n\n I\'m considering ""C R O W D"" -> but C at 1? Avoid.\n\n How about ""SHIRT""? But H and I? And no C? We must include C? Because we haven\'t tested whether C is at other positions? Actually, we do have to include C and R? Because they are present? \n\n We know the secret word has both C and R? So our next guess must have both.\n\n So let me search for words with C and R? and without A, N, E? Also, 5 letters.\n\n Examples:\n - CROWD: NO because C at 1? \n - CURRY: has U? But C at 1? \n - CRYPT: C at 1? \n - BROIL: no C? but has O and I? \n\n I need to avoid C at 1? So how about starting with a different letter? \n\n Let me try words that have R as first letter? \n\n R and then ...? But the letter C must be somewhere.\n\n Words: \n - ""R A C E S"" -> has A and E? Ruled out? \n - ""R O C K S"" -> R(1), O(2), C(3), K(4), S(5) -> but O, K, S are untested? And this word avoids A, N, E? So ""ROCKS"" is valid.\n\n So ""ROCKS"": \n   Position 1: R -> but that\'s possible? Because we only know R isn\'t at 2? It could be at 1? \n   Position 2: O -> untested? \n   Position 3: C? But wait: the feedback for C was that it\'s present? but we haven\'t tested position 3? \n   Position 4: K and 5: S? \n\n This is a valid guess? But note: the secret word does not have C? Actually, it does? But we know it\'s present? \n\n Also, we are avoiding A, N, E? So ""ROCKS"" meets the criteria.\n\n Alternatively: ""CRISP"" has C at one? Avoid? \n\n Another word: ""PORCH"": \n   P(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5)? \n   This has R at 3 (never tested) and C at 4 (never tested). Also, P, O, H are new? \n   And no A, N, E? \n\n Also valid? \n\n So between ""ROCKS"" and ""PORCH""? Both are good? \n\n Another word: ""CROWD"" -> C at 1? Avoid? \n\n Or ""TRICK"": \n   T(1), R(2) -> wait, R at 2? But we know the secret word has R not at position 2? So if we put R at 2, then the feedback would show \'-\'? Because it is present? But not at that position? So it wouldn\'t tell us anything? Because we already know that? So it\'s inefficient? \n\n Therefore, avoid putting R at 2 and C at 1? So for R, avoid position 2? For C, avoid position 1? \n\n In ""ROCKS"": R is at 1? That is okay? Because we don\'t know about position 1? Only that position 2 was wrong? So position 1 is a possibility? Similarly, in ""PORCH"", R is at 3 and C at 4? \n\n But note: if we choose ""ROCKS"", we are putting R at 1 and C at 3? \n\n How about we choose a word that uses more new letters? \n\n We know the secret word has C and R? and three other letters? We haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? \n\n So let me choose a word that covers many common letters? \n\n ""ROCKS"" tests R, O, C, K, S? \n ""PORCH"" tests P, O, R, C, H? \n\n Both are fine? I\'ll pick ""ROCKS"" because it has S at the end? Which is common? \n\n But wait: in the next guess, if we get feedback for these, we might learn more? \n\n Actually, let me double-check: we know the secret word has C and R? So we want to test positions? \n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that has R not at 1? And C not at 1? So let me try putting R near the middle? \n\n Example: ""STRIP"" -> has S, T, R, I, P? But missing C? We must include C? \n\n How about ""SCR?"" ... ""SCRIP""? S(1), C(2), R(3), I(4), P(5)? This has C at position 2? and R at position 3? \n And avoids A,N,E? \n\n So ""SCRIP"" is a word? Yes? Meaning: a small piece? \n\n This avoids the known bad positions? \n For C: we tried position 1 before? Now position 2? And R was tried at position 2? Now position 3? \n\n Also, using S, C, R, I, P? All new letters? \n\n So feedback would tell us:\n - If C is at position 2: it would be ✓? Or if it\'s elsewhere? \n But we know that the secret word has C? So if it\'s at position 2? We\'ll know? Similarly, R? \n\n Both ""SCRIP"" and ""ROCKS"" are valid? \n\n But note: we haven\'t tested S? So it\'s also informative? \n\n However, in ""SCRIP"": \n   Position 1: S? \n   Position 2: C? -> testing C at 2? \n   Position 3: R? -> testing R at 3? \n   Position 4: I? \n   Position 5: P?\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""CRWTH""? But that\'s not common? \n\n Let me go with ""SCRIP"". \n\n But note: we must not include letters that are ruled out? So ""SCRIP"" is okay? \n\n Another candidate: ""BROCK"" -> but O and K? And R at 2? Avoid R at 2? \n\n Actually, ""BROCK"" has R at position 2? So avoid.\n\n So I think ""SCRIP"" is a good choice? \n\n Alternatively, ""PORCH"" is also good? \n\n But ""PORCH"" doesn\'t have a new vowel? We have O? But both SCRIP and PORCH have O? Actually, SCRIP has I? \n\n Which letters have we tested? In the first guess: C,R,A,N,E? So we tested A (vowel) and E (vowel)? So remaining vowels: O, I, U? We haven\'t tested any? So it is good to test one? \n\n ""SCRIP"" has I? which is a common vowel? \n\n So I choose ""SCRIP"".\n\n However, note: the feedback might be:\n  If the secret word has S? We don\'t know? So we\'ll get information? \n\n So my guess is ""SCRIP"".\n\n Let me write it: <guess>scrip</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is present in the word but not in position 1 (as indicated by ""-"")\n- R is present but not in position 2\n- Letters A, N, and E are absent (as indicated by ""x"")\n- The secret word contains C and R, but excludes A, N, and E.\n\nFor the second guess, I aim to:\n1.

We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(-), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)
Interpretation:
- C is in the secret word but NOT in position 1.
- R is in the secret word but NOT in position 2.
- A, N, E are NOT in the word.

Guess 2: scrip -> S(x), C(-), R(✓), I(x), P(-)
Interpretation:
- S is NOT in the word.
- C is in the word but NOT in position 2 (since we got '-', meaning present but wrong position).
- R is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 3).
- I is NOT in the word.
- P is in the word but NOT in position 5 (since it was at position 5 and got '-').

So we now know:
1. R is correct and fixed at position 3. So the secret word has R in the third position.
2. The secret word contains C and P, but they are not in the positions we've guessed:
   - C is not in position 1 (from 'crane') and not in position 2 (from 'scrip')
   - P is not in position 5 (from 'scrip')
3. The secret word does NOT contain: A, E, I, N, S.
4. We have these letters present: C, R, P (R's position is known).

Additionally, the secret word has two more letters that we haven't identified yet? Since we know:
- The word has five letters.
- We have R at position 3 and two other confirmed letters (C and P) and two unknown letters? Actually, C, R, P are three letters? But we need five? So two more letters must be present? And we know they cannot be A, E, I, N, S? And also must be letters we haven't tried? 

From the feedback, we know the secret word consists of:
- Position 3: R
- The remaining positions: 1,2,4,5 must contain C, P, and two other letters? But note: we know the word has C and P? And R? So three letters? Therefore, two more letters? 

But wait: in feedback from ""scrip"", we have:
- C present (wrong position) -> so C must be in one of the remaining positions? 1,4,5? (since position 2 and 3 are taken? But position 3 is R? So yes, C cannot be at 2 or 3? So must be at 1,4,5? Similarly, P is present? And we know it is not at position 5? So P could be at 1,4? (since position 2 and 3 are occupied? Actually, position 3 is R? So positions 1,2,4,5 are open? But no: in the secret word, position 3 is fixed to R? So the positions we are filling: 1,2,4,5.

Constraints:
- C must be in one of positions 1,4,5? But note: we know C cannot be at position 1? Because from guess1: C was at position1 and feedback was '-' meaning it's not at 1? So actually, from guess1 we learned C is not at position1? Therefore, C must be in position 4 or 5? 
- Similarly, P cannot be at position 5? So P must be in position 1,2, or 4? 

But wait: position 2? We haven't tested P at position 2? So that is possible? Similarly, position 4? 

So for P: positions 1, 2, 4? 

Also, we need two more letters? Let me denote the secret word as: _ _ R _ _
Position 1: can be? (not C? because C cannot be at 1? and not P? but P could be? Actually, no constraint? Only that C cannot be at 1? But P can be at 1? And C must be at 4 or 5? 

But note: the feedback also tells us the presence of letters? So we have C, P, R? Then two more letters? 

And we have eliminated A, E, I, N, S? So the alphabet left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? We haven't tested these? So we need to choose two from these? 

Now, to form a 5-letter word? 

So possible positions:

Position 1: ? -> cannot be C? but can be P? or one of the unknown letters? 
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: R (fixed)
Position 4: possible for C or P? 
Position 5: possible for C? since P cannot be at 5? 

But note: C must be at 4 or 5? Because we know:
- Not at 1 (from guess1)
- Not at 2 (from guess2) -> and position3 is R? so no? 
So C at 4 or 5? 

And P: can be at 1, 2, 4? But if at 4? Then position 4 cannot have two letters? So we need to assign P to one of 1,2,4? and C to 4 or 5? 
But if P is at 4? Then C cannot be at 4? So if P is at 4, then C must be at 5? 
If P is at 1? Then C can be at 4 or 5? 
If P is at 2? Then C can be at 4 or 5? 

Now, we need a word that satisfies:
- Position 3: R
- C is in positions 4 or 5?
- P is in positions 1, 2, or 4?
- Two more letters from the available set? 

Also, note: the word must be a valid English word? 

So let me think of possible words:

Option 1: P at position 1? Then word: P _ R [C or for position4] [if C at4, then position5 is unknown? if C at5, then position4 is unknown] 

Example: if C is at 5? then word: P _ R ? C
But we need a word? Example: ""P U R I C""? -> not a word? and I is ruled out? 

Another: ""P A R C H""? -> but A is ruled out? 

Need to use available letters? 

How about ""P O R C H""? -> O is available? And H? But then position 4 is C? and position 5 is H? 
But wait: C is at position 4? Then P at 1? 
But note: we have C at position4? and in guess2: P was at position5? and we learned P is not at 5? So that's okay? 

Also, does ""PORCH"" satisfy the constraints? 
- Position3: R (correct)
- C: at position4? which is allowed? 
- P: at position1? which is allowed? 
- Letters: P, O, R, C, H? -> O and H are new? And O hasn't been ruled out? 

But wait: C was in ""scrip"" at position2? and we got '-' meaning C is not at2? And R at3 is correct? 

In ""scrip"", the guess was S,C,R,I,P -> positions: 1:S, 2:C, 3:R, 4:I, 5:P? 
Feedback: S(x) -> not in word? 
C(-) -> present but wrong position? Since C was at position2, but it must be elsewhere? 
In ""PORCH"", C is at4? So that matches?

However, in ""PORCH"", P is at1? So let's see: if the secret word is ""PORCH"", then:
- In guess1 ""crane"": C is at1? But ""PORCH"" has C at4? So C would be '-'? which we got? R is at2? ""PORCH"" has R at3? So R was '-'? which we got? Also, A,N,E missing? Correct.
- In guess2 ""scrip"": S->x? correct? 
   C at2: but in secret word C is at4? so wrong position? '-'? correct? 
   R at3: matches? so ✓? 
   I->x? correct? 
   P at5: but in secret word, P is at1? so wrong position? -> but feedback? We got '-'? which is correct? 

So ""PORCH"" is a candidate? 

But wait: we have P at1? Then what about C? We said C must be at4 or5? In ""PORCH"", it's at4? so okay? 

Another possibility? What if P is at2? Then word: ? P R ? ? 
With C at4 or5? 

Example: ? P R O C -> ""U P R O C""? not a word? 
Or ""L P R O C""? not a word? 

Alternatively: ? P R C ? -> this forces C at4? Then the word ends with C? So last letter C? And P at2? 

Example: ""O P R C ...""? -> ""OPRC?""? Not a word? 

Common words? 
How about ""PURCH""? Not a word? 
""PARTY"" -> but A not allowed? 
""PERCH"" -> E not allowed? 

Now, if P is at4? Then word: ? ? R P ? ? But wait: position4 is P? Then C must be at5? 
So word: ? ? R P C? 

Example: ""C A R P S""? -> but C is at1? which we cannot? So ... 
Let _ _ R P C? 
Example: ""D O R P C""? Not a word? 
""F I R P C""? not allowed? 
""W O R P C""? Not a word? 

Alternatively: ""CHIRP"" is a word? But C at1? not allowed? 
So no? 

Another candidate: ""CRUMP""? but U? and M? But C at1? not allowed? 

So it seems ""PORCH"" is a candidate? 

But we must consider: if C is at5? Then with P at1? Then word: P _ R ? C? Example: ""P A R K C""? Not a word? 
Or ""P O R K C""? -> ""PORKC"" is not a word? 

If P at2? Then word: _ P R ? C? 
Example: ""L P R I C""? has I? not allowed? 
""T P R O C""? -> not a word? 
""W P R O C""? not a word? 

Alternatively, if we have P at4? And C at5? Then word: ? ? R P C? 
As above, no common words? 

But what about ""H Y P R C""? not a word? 

So ""PORCH"" seems the best candidate? But wait: in ""PORCH"", we have O at position2? and H at position5? And in our constraints, we haven't tested O and H? So that's acceptable? But we must make sure it doesn't use forbidden letters? 

There is also ""PARCH"" but A is ruled out? 
""PERCH"" -> E ruled out? 
""PORKS""? -> K and S? But S is ruled out? From guess2: S is absent? 

Therefore, ""PORCH"" appears to be the most probable candidate? 

But note: we are not sure? It might be? However, we need to make a guess? 

Another word: could C be at position5? Then what about P? 

Option: P at position1? Then we have P ? R ? C? 
We need the fourth letter? 
Words: ""P U R R C""? Not a word? 
""P O R C H""? -> that has C at4? 
For C at5: ""P O R T C""? Not a word? 
""P A R C H""? -> A not allowed? 
""P I R C E""? I and E not allowed? 
So no common word with C at5? 

What if P at2? Then ? P R ? C? 
Words: ""T P R O C""? Not a word? 
""O P R O C"" -> no? 

So indeed, the only common word that fits is ""PORCH""? 

But wait: what if the secret word is ""C R U M P""? But C at1? not allowed? Because we know C not at1? 

Or ""SCRUM""? but S is ruled out? 

Therefore, let's go with ""PORCH"". 

But note: we haven't tested O and H? So it might be incorrect? We are on guess 3? 

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests more letters? But since we have fixed R at3? We need to include? 

But first, note: we have 6 tries? So we can take risks? 

But if we guess ""PORCH"", it might be the word? 

But perhaps there's another candidate? 

What about ""CORPS""? 
- C at1? but C cannot be at1? So avoid? 

""PROOF""? -> has O? but no C? We must have C? 

Wait, unless the secret word doesn't have C? But it does? Because feedback confirms C? 

Yes: from guess1 and guess2? Guess1 had C at position1 and got '-', meaning present? and guess2 had C at2 and got '-'? So C must be in the word? 

Similarly, P must be? 

So another word: ""TROOP""? -> has no C? 
""GROUP""? -> no C? 
""CROWD""? -> C at1? not allowed? 

So I think ""PORCH"" is the best bet? 

Let me list the constraints again:
- Position3: R
- C must be at4 or5? 
- P must be at1,2, or4? 
But if P at4? Then C must be at5? 
So two scenarios:
Scenario A: P at1? then C at4 or5? 
Scenario B: P at2? then C at4 or5? 
Scenario C: P at4? then C at5? 

In scenario C: word: ? ? R P C? Does a word exist? 
- Letters: ?,?,R,P,C? and avoid A,E,I,N,S? 
For example: ""L U R P C""? Not a word? 
""W O R P C"" -> no? 
So perhaps no word? 

Therefore, likely scenario A or B? 

In scenario A: P at1? then word: P ? R [and then either C at4 and a letter? or C at5 and a letter at4?] 
If C at4? then P? R ? ? -> P ? R ? C? 
""P a R d C""? But avoid A? 
""P O R C H"" -> as above? 
Or ""P O R C T""? -> ""TORCH""? Wait, T? 

Wait, ""TORCH""? 
- T at1? O at2? R at3? C at4? H at5? 
But wait: we have P? If the secret word is ""TORCH"", then does it have P? No? But we know the secret word must have P? 

So no? 

Therefore, only ""PORCH"" seems valid? 

Alternatively, scenario B: P at2? 
Then word: ? P R ? and C at4 or5? 
If C at4? Then word: ? P R C ? 
Example: ""O P R C H""? -> ""OPRCH""? Not a word? 
If C at5? Then: ? P R ? C? 
Example: ""O P R H C""? not a word? 
Or ""T P R O C""? Not a word? 

But note: we have to have two unknown letters? So in scenario B? 
With P at2? and R at3? 
Then position1? unknown? Then position4 and5? One of them must be C? And the other unknown? 
But C must be at4 or5? 

Example: word: letter1, P, R, letter4, letter5? with letter5 being C? 
Or letter4 being C? 

Is there a word? 
- With letter4=C? So ? P R C ? 
Example: ""U P R C H""? Not a word? ""APRCH"" -> invalid? 
- With letter5=C? So ? P R ? C? 
Example: ""U P R O C"" -> ""UPROC"" not a word? 
But ""OPROC""? Not a word? 
""SPRVC""? Not a word and S ruled out? 

So no? 

Therefore, the only candidate word we have is ""PORCH""? 

But wait: what if we try another arrangement? C could be at position5? and P at1? then ? P ? R ? ? No: position3 is R fixed? 

So P at1? then word: P ? R ? C? 

We have: P, ?, R, ?, C? 
Must form a valid word? 
We already tried? No common words? 
Except ""PORCH"" has C at4? 

But if C at5? P at1? 
Then P, ?, R, ?, C? 
For example: ""P A R T C""? Not valid? 
""P O R T C""? Not valid? 
""PARKS"" -> but K and S? S ruled out? 
""PERKS"" -> E ruled out? 
""PORKS"" -> but S ruled out? 

So indeed, only ""PORCH""? 

Therefore, let's guess ""PORCH""? 

But note: we might be wrong? So we should consider testing? 

Alternatively, we could make a guess that tests multiple possibilities? For example, if we don't guess ""PORCH"", we could guess a word that tests whether O or H are present? 

But since we have 6 guesses? And we are at guess3? 

But note: we are constrained by the known letters? We must include C, P, R? So any guess must have R at3? and C and P? 

So we can design a guess that has:
- Position3: R
- C in position5? (to test if C is at5? because we don't know? But if C at5 gets ✓, then we know? And similarly for P? 
We could test P at1? And C at5? 

But what word? Say ""P O R T C""? Not valid? 

Also, we want to use common letters? 

Another idea: include missing vowel? O? or U? 

So let me try to find a word that fits? 

For example, if we set P at1? C at5? Then the word must be: P ? R ? C? 
The letter at position2 and position4? Must be from available letters? 

Position2: O? Then position4: ? Could be M? Then ""P O R M C""? Not a word? 
Or position2: U? Then position4: L? ""P U R L C""? Not a word? 
Or position2: O? Position4: T? ""P O R T C""? Not a word? 
Or position2: T? Position4: O? ""P T R O C""? -> ""PROTOC""? No? 

Therefore, I think ""PORCH"" is the only plausible candidate? 

So I'll go with ""PORCH"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: crane → C(-), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)**  
   - **C** is in the secret word but NOT in position 1.  
   - **R** is in the secret word but NOT in position 2.  
   - **A, N, E** are NOT in the word.  

2. **Guess 2: scrip → S(x), C(-), R(✓), I(x), and P(-)**  
   - **S** and **I** are NOT in the word.  
   - **C** is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   - **R** is CORRECT and fixed at position 3.  
   - **P** is in the word but NOT in position 5.  

### Key Deductions:
- **R** is confirmed at position 3. Secret word format: `_ _ R _ _`.
- **C** must be present, but cannot be in positions 1 (from guess 1) or 2 (from guess 2). Possible positions: 4 or 5.
- **P** must be present, but cannot be in position 5 (from guess 2). Possible positions: 1, 2, or 4.
- Excluded letters: **A, E, I, N, S** (absent from the word).
- Remaining unknown: Two more letters (since the word has 5 letters, and we know C, P, R). Possible letters: **B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.

### Evaluating Possibilities:
- **C** and **P** cannot share position 4. If P is at 4, C must be at 5. If P is at 1 or 2, C can be at 4 or 5.
- **Valid word examples**:
  - `P _ R _ _` (P at position 1): Only `PORCH` fits (letters: P, O, R, C, H).  
    - O and H are untested/available letters.  
    - Positions: P(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5).  
    - Satisfies constraints:  
      - R at 3 (fixed).  
      - C at 4 (valid, not position 1 or 2).  
      - P at 1 (valid, not position 5).
- Other combinations (e.g., P at 2 or C at 5) yield no common English words after testing (`*P R C*`, `*P R *C`, `*P R P*`, etc. are invalid/uncommon).

### Conclusion:
**PORCH** is the most plausible candidate:  
- Tests P at 1, C at 4, and new letters O and H.  
- Maximizes information by covering common vowels/consonants.  
- If incorrect, feedback will refine positions/letters for subsequent guesses.

<guess>porch</guess>",porch,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(-), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)
Interpretation:
- C is in the secret word but NOT in position 1.
- R is in the secret word but NOT in position 2.
- A, N, E are NOT in the word.

Guess 2: scrip -> S(x), C(-), R(✓), I(x), P(-)
Interpretation:
- S is NOT in the word.
- C is in the word but NOT in position 2 (since we got '-', meaning present but wrong position).
- R is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 3).
- I is NOT in the word.
- P is in the word but NOT in position 5 (since it was at position 5 and got '-').

So we now know:
1. R is correct and fixed at position 3. So the secret word has R in the third position.
2. The secret word contains C and P, but they are not in the positions we've guessed:
   - C is not in position 1 (from 'crane') and not in position 2 (from 'scrip')
   - P is not in position 5 (from 'scrip')
3. The secret word does NOT contain: A, E, I, N, S.
4. We have these letters present: C, R, P (R's position is known).

Additionally, the secret word has two more letters that we haven't identified yet? Since we know:
- The word has five letters.
- We have R at position 3 and two other confirmed letters (C and P) and two unknown letters? Actually, C, R, P are three letters? But we need five? So two more letters must be present? And we know they cannot be A, E, I, N, S? And also must be letters we haven't tried? 

From the feedback, we know the secret word consists of:
- Position 3: R
- The remaining positions: 1,2,4,5 must contain C, P, and two other letters? But note: we know the word has C and P? And R? So three letters? Therefore, two more letters? 

But wait: in feedback from ""scrip"", we have:
- C present (wrong position) -> so C must be in one of the remaining positions? 1,4,5? (since position 2 and 3 are taken? But position 3 is R? So yes, C cannot be at 2 or 3? So must be at 1,4,5? Similarly, P is present? And we know it is not at position 5? So P could be at 1,4? (since position 2 and 3 are occupied? Actually, position 3 is R? So positions 1,2,4,5 are open? But no: in the secret word, position 3 is fixed to R? So the positions we are filling: 1,2,4,5.

Constraints:
- C must be in one of positions 1,4,5? But note: we know C cannot be at position 1? Because from guess1: C was at position1 and feedback was '-' meaning it's not at 1? So actually, from guess1 we learned C is not at position1? Therefore, C must be in position 4 or 5? 
- Similarly, P cannot be at position 5? So P must be in position 1,2, or 4? 

But wait: position 2? We haven't tested P at position 2? So that is possible? Similarly, position 4? 

So for P: positions 1, 2, 4? 

Also, we need two more letters? Let me denote the secret word as: _ _ R _ _
Position 1: can be? (not C? because C cannot be at 1? and not P? but P could be? Actually, no constraint? Only that C cannot be at 1? But P can be at 1? And C must be at 4 or 5? 

But note: the feedback also tells us the presence of letters? So we have C, P, R? Then two more letters? 

And we have eliminated A, E, I, N, S? So the alphabet left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? We haven't tested these? So we need to choose two from these? 

Now, to form a 5-letter word? 

So possible positions:

Position 1: ? -> cannot be C? but can be P? or one of the unknown letters? 
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: R (fixed)
Position 4: possible for C or P? 
Position 5: possible for C? since P cannot be at 5? 

But note: C must be at 4 or 5? Because we know:
- Not at 1 (from guess1)
- Not at 2 (from guess2) -> and position3 is R? so no? 
So C at 4 or 5? 

And P: can be at 1, 2, 4? But if at 4? Then position 4 cannot have two letters? So we need to assign P to one of 1,2,4? and C to 4 or 5? 
But if P is at 4? Then C cannot be at 4? So if P is at 4, then C must be at 5? 
If P is at 1? Then C can be at 4 or 5? 
If P is at 2? Then C can be at 4 or 5? 

Now, we need a word that satisfies:
- Position 3: R
- C is in positions 4 or 5?
- P is in positions 1, 2, or 4?
- Two more letters from the available set? 

Also, note: the word must be a valid English word? 

So let me think of possible words:

Option 1: P at position 1? Then word: P _ R [C or for position4] [if C at4, then position5 is unknown? if C at5, then position4 is unknown] 

Example: if C is at 5? then word: P _ R ? C
But we need a word? Example: ""P U R I C""? -> not a word? and I is ruled out? 

Another: ""P A R C H""? -> but A is ruled out? 

Need to use available letters? 

How about ""P O R C H""? -> O is available? And H? But then position 4 is C? and position 5 is H? 
But wait: C is at position 4? Then P at 1? 
But note: we have C at position4? and in guess2: P was at position5? and we learned P is not at 5? So that's okay? 

Also, does ""PORCH"" satisfy the constraints? 
- Position3: R (correct)
- C: at position4? which is allowed? 
- P: at position1? which is allowed? 
- Letters: P, O, R, C, H? -> O and H are new? And O hasn't been ruled out? 

But wait: C was in ""scrip"" at position2? and we got '-' meaning C is not at2? And R at3 is correct? 

In ""scrip"", the guess was S,C,R,I,P -> positions: 1:S, 2:C, 3:R, 4:I, 5:P? 
Feedback: S(x) -> not in word? 
C(-) -> present but wrong position? Since C was at position2, but it must be elsewhere? 
In ""PORCH"", C is at4? So that matches?

However, in ""PORCH"", P is at1? So let's see: if the secret word is ""PORCH"", then:
- In guess1 ""crane"": C is at1? But ""PORCH"" has C at4? So C would be '-'? which we got? R is at2? ""PORCH"" has R at3? So R was '-'? which we got? Also, A,N,E missing? Correct.
- In guess2 ""scrip"": S->x? correct? 
   C at2: but in secret word C is at4? so wrong position? '-'? correct? 
   R at3: matches? so ✓? 
   I->x? correct? 
   P at5: but in secret word, P is at1? so wrong position? -> but feedback? We got '-'? which is correct? 

So ""PORCH"" is a candidate? 

But wait: we have P at1? Then what about C? We said C must be at4 or5? In ""PORCH"", it's at4? so okay? 

Another possibility? What if P is at2? Then word: ? P R ? ? 
With C at4 or5? 

Example: ? P R O C -> ""U P R O C""? not a word? 
Or ""L P R O C""? not a word? 

Alternatively: ? P R C ? -> this forces C at4? Then the word ends with C? So last letter C? And P at2? 

Example: ""O P R C ...""? -> ""OPRC?""? Not a word? 

Common words? 
How about ""PURCH""? Not a word? 
""PARTY"" -> but A not allowed? 
""PERCH"" -> E not allowed? 

Now, if P is at4? Then word: ? ? R P ? ? But wait: position4 is P? Then C must be at5? 
So word: ? ? R P C? 

Example: ""C A R P S""? -> but C is at1? which we cannot? So ... 
Let _ _ R P C? 
Example: ""D O R P C""? Not a word? 
""F I R P C""? not allowed? 
""W O R P C""? Not a word? 

Alternatively: ""CHIRP"" is a word? But C at1? not allowed? 
So no? 

Another candidate: ""CRUMP""? but U? and M? But C at1? not allowed? 

So it seems ""PORCH"" is a candidate? 

But we must consider: if C is at5? Then with P at1? Then word: P _ R ? C? Example: ""P A R K C""? Not a word? 
Or ""P O R K C""? -> ""PORKC"" is not a word? 

If P at2? Then word: _ P R ? C? 
Example: ""L P R I C""? has I? not allowed? 
""T P R O C""? -> not a word? 
""W P R O C""? not a word? 

Alternatively, if we have P at4? And C at5? Then word: ? ? R P C? 
As above, no common words? 

But what about ""H Y P R C""? not a word? 

So ""PORCH"" seems the best candidate? But wait: in ""PORCH"", we have O at position2? and H at position5? And in our constraints, we haven't tested O and H? So that's acceptable? But we must make sure it doesn't use forbidden letters? 

There is also ""PARCH"" but A is ruled out? 
""PERCH"" -> E ruled out? 
""PORKS""? -> K and S? But S is ruled out? From guess2: S is absent? 

Therefore, ""PORCH"" appears to be the most probable candidate? 

But note: we are not sure? It might be? However, we need to make a guess? 

Another word: could C be at position5? Then what about P? 

Option: P at position1? Then we have P ? R ? C? 
We need the fourth letter? 
Words: ""P U R R C""? Not a word? 
""P O R C H""? -> that has C at4? 
For C at5: ""P O R T C""? Not a word? 
""P A R C H""? -> A not allowed? 
""P I R C E""? I and E not allowed? 
So no common word with C at5? 

What if P at2? Then ? P R ? C? 
Words: ""T P R O C""? Not a word? 
""O P R O C"" -> no? 

So indeed, the only common word that fits is ""PORCH""? 

But wait: what if the secret word is ""C R U M P""? But C at1? not allowed? Because we know C not at1? 

Or ""SCRUM""? but S is ruled out? 

Therefore, let's go with ""PORCH"". 

But note: we haven't tested O and H? So it might be incorrect? We are on guess 3? 

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests more letters? But since we have fixed R at3? We need to include? 

But first, note: we have 6 tries? So we can take risks? 

But if we guess ""PORCH"", it might be the word? 

But perhaps there's another candidate? 

What about ""CORPS""? 
- C at1? but C cannot be at1? So avoid? 

""PROOF""? -> has O? but no C? We must have C? 

Wait, unless the secret word doesn't have C? But it does? Because feedback confirms C? 

Yes: from guess1 and guess2? Guess1 had C at position1 and got '-', meaning present? and guess2 had C at2 and got '-'? So C must be in the word? 

Similarly, P must be? 

So another word: ""TROOP""? -> has no C? 
""GROUP""? -> no C? 
""CROWD""? -> C at1? not allowed? 

So I think ""PORCH"" is the best bet? 

Let me list the constraints again:
- Position3: R
- C must be at4 or5? 
- P must be at1,2, or4? 
But if P at4? Then C must be at5? 
So two scenarios:
Scenario A: P at1? then C at4 or5? 
Scenario B: P at2? then C at4 or5? 
Scenario C: P at4? then C at5? 

In scenario C: word: ? ? R P C? Does a word exist? 
- Letters: ?,?,R,P,C? and avoid A,E,I,N,S? 
For example: ""L U R P C""? Not a word? 
""W O R P C"" -> no? 
So perhaps no word? 

Therefore, likely scenario A or B? 

In scenario A: P at1? then word: P ? R [and then either C at4 and a letter? or C at5 and a letter at4?] 
If C at4? then P? R ? ? -> P ? R ? C? 
""P a R d C""? But avoid A? 
""P O R C H"" -> as above? 
Or ""P O R C T""? -> ""TORCH""? Wait, T? 

Wait, ""TORCH""? 
- T at1? O at2? R at3? C at4? H at5? 
But wait: we have P? If the secret word is ""TORCH"", then does it have P? No? But we know the secret word must have P? 

So no? 

Therefore, only ""PORCH"" seems valid? 

Alternatively, scenario B: P at2? 
Then word: ? P R ? and C at4 or5? 
If C at4? Then word: ? P R C ? 
Example: ""O P R C H""? -> ""OPRCH""? Not a word? 
If C at5? Then: ? P R ? C? 
Example: ""O P R H C""? not a word? 
Or ""T P R O C""? Not a word? 

But note: we have to have two unknown letters? So in scenario B? 
With P at2? and R at3? 
Then position1? unknown? Then position4 and5? One of them must be C? And the other unknown? 
But C must be at4 or5? 

Example: word: letter1, P, R, letter4, letter5? with letter5 being C? 
Or letter4 being C? 

Is there a word? 
- With letter4=C? So ? P R C ? 
Example: ""U P R C H""? Not a word? ""APRCH"" -> invalid? 
- With letter5=C? So ? P R ? C? 
Example: ""U P R O C"" -> ""UPROC"" not a word? 
But ""OPROC""? Not a word? 
""SPRVC""? Not a word and S ruled out? 

So no? 

Therefore, the only candidate word we have is ""PORCH""? 

But wait: what if we try another arrangement? C could be at position5? and P at1? then ? P ? R ? ? No: position3 is R fixed? 

So P at1? then word: P ? R ? C? 

We have: P, ?, R, ?, C? 
Must form a valid word? 
We already tried? No common words? 
Except ""PORCH"" has C at4? 

But if C at5? P at1? 
Then P, ?, R, ?, C? 
For example: ""P A R T C""? Not valid? 
""P O R T C""? Not valid? 
""PARKS"" -> but K and S? S ruled out? 
""PERKS"" -> E ruled out? 
""PORKS"" -> but S ruled out? 

So indeed, only ""PORCH""? 

Therefore, let's guess ""PORCH""? 

But note: we might be wrong? So we should consider testing? 

Alternatively, we could make a guess that tests multiple possibilities? For example, if we don't guess ""PORCH"", we could guess a word that tests whether O or H are present? 

But since we have 6 guesses? And we are at guess3? 

But note: we are constrained by the known letters? We must include C, P, R? So any guess must have R at3? and C and P? 

So we can design a guess that has:
- Position3: R
- C in position5? (to test if C is at5? because we don't know? But if C at5 gets ✓, then we know? And similarly for P? 
We could test P at1? And C at5? 

But what word? Say ""P O R T C""? Not valid? 

Also, we want to use common letters? 

Another idea: include missing vowel? O? or U? 

So let me try to find a word that fits? 

For example, if we set P at1? C at5? Then the word must be: P ? R ? C? 
The letter at position2 and position4? Must be from available letters? 

Position2: O? Then position4: ? Could be M? Then ""P O R M C""? Not a word? 
Or position2: U? Then position4: L? ""P U R L C""? Not a word? 
Or position2: O? Position4: T? ""P O R T C""? Not a word? 
Or position2: T? Position4: O? ""P T R O C""? -> ""PROTOC""? No? 

Therefore, I think ""PORCH"" is the only plausible candidate? 

So I'll go with ""PORCH"". 

<guess>porch</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: crane → C(-), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)**  
   - **C** is in the secret word but NOT in position 1.  
   - **R** is in the secret word but NOT in position 2.  
   - **A, N, E** are NOT in the word.  

2. **Guess 2: scrip → S(x), C(-), R(✓), I(x), and P(-)**  
   - **S** and **I** are NOT in the word.  
   - **C** is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   - **R** is CORRECT and fixed at position 3.  
   - **P** is in the word but NOT in position 5.  

### Key Deductions:
- **R** is confirmed at position 3. Secret word format: `_ _ R _ _`.
- **C** must be present, but cannot be in positions 1 (from guess 1) or 2 (from guess 2). Possible positions: 4 or 5.
- **P** must be present, but cannot be in position 5 (from guess 2). Possible positions: 1, 2, or 4.
- Excluded letters: **A, E, I, N, S** (absent from the word).
- Remaining unknown: Two more letters (since the word has 5 letters, and we know C, P, R). Possible letters: **B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.

### Evaluating Possibilities:
- **C** and **P** cannot share position 4. If P is at 4, C must be at 5. If P is at 1 or 2, C can be at 4 or 5.
- **Valid word examples**:
  - `P _ R _ _` (P at position 1): Only `PORCH` fits (letters: P, O, R, C, H).  
    - O and H are untested/available letters.  
    - Positions: P(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), H(5).  
    - Satisfies constraints:  
      - R at 3 (fixed).  
      - C at 4 (valid, not position 1 or 2).  
      - P at 1 (valid, not position 5).
- Other combinations (e.g., P at 2 or C at 5) yield no common English words after testing (`*P R C*`, `*P R *C`, `*P R P*`, etc. are invalid/uncommon).

### Conclusion:
**PORCH** is the most plausible candidate:  
- Tests P at 1, C at 4, and new letters O and H.  
- Maximizes information by covering common vowels/consonants.  
- If incorrect, feedback will refine positions/letters for subsequent guesses.",Guess 3: porch -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) R(✓) C(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
