We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So we know:
- The secret word contains the letters 'R' and 'E', but not in the positions they were guessed (position 2 and 5 respectively).
- The letters 'C', 'A', 'N' are not in the word.

We must avoid using C, A, N in the next guess.

The word has 5 letters, and we know it has R and E, but we don't know their exact positions.

Let me think of a good second word that includes R and E (but not in position 2 for R, and not in position 5 for E) and avoids C, A, N.

Also, we want to cover new common letters to get more information.

Common consonants we haven't tried: S, T, L, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, etc.
Vowels: We have E, so we might want to try other vowels: O, U, I (but note we avoided A).

But note: 'R' is in the word, but not in position 2. So R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? Wait, position 5 was E with '-', meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. Similarly, R is not in position 2.

Let me denote positions: 1: C (x), 2: R (-), 3: A (x), 4: N (x), 5: E (-)

So:
- R must be in one of positions 1, 3, 4, but note:
  - Position 1: We had C (x) -> so R could be at position 1? Actually, position 1 was C, so R wasn't there? Wait, no: the feedback for R is '-', meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in position 1? But wait, position 1 is occupied by C, so if R was in position 1, it would have been marked as 'x' because we guessed a wrong letter? The feedback is per letter: the secret word doesn't have C in position 1? Actually, we know that the secret word might have R in position 1? Let me clarify.

Actually, the feedback symbol applies to each letter independently. For the first position, we guessed C and it was 'x', meaning the letter at that position is not C. The secret word could have any letter at that position - including R? Since we don't have any other information about position 1? Actually, if the secret word had R at position 1, then when we guessed C at 1 (which is wrong) and R at 2 (which is present elsewhere), then R at position 1 wouldn't be revealed because we didn't guess R in position 1. We only guessed R in position 2, so that R (at position 2) was compared to the secret word. Therefore, the secret word does have R, just not in position 2.

Similarly, E is in the word but not in position 5.

So possible positions for R: 1, 3, or 4 (but note position 3 and 4 we had A and N which are both absent, so R could be in 1, 3, or 4).

Wait, in positions 3 and 4 in the secret word? In the guess, position 3 was A and 4 was N, both 'x', meaning the secret word does not have A or N at any position? So, the secret word might have R in position 3? But then, since we guessed N at position 4, and it was missing, R could be in position 4? Or in position 1? And we guessed E at position 5 and it's present elsewhere.

So we need a word that:
- Includes R and E (both are present)
- Does not contain C, A, N
- And try to put R and E in new positions (not position 2 for R, not position 5 for E).

Let me list possible letters: We have used: C, R, A, N, E. Avoid C, A, N.

Common letters remaining: S, T, L, O, I, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, U, etc.

A good candidate word might be ""TRIES"" or ""ROGUE""? But we have to avoid A and N.

Let me think: we want to test R in a different position. Since position 2 was wrong, let's try putting R at position 1? Or position 3? But note: position 1 we don't know, so trying R at position 1 might be good? However, we also know E is present, but not at position 5.

Alternatively, we could try E in a different position (not 5).

Also, we want to cover new consonants and vowels.

The word ""STORE"" comes to mind: 
- S: new consonant
- T: new consonant
- O: new vowel
- R: we know it's in the word, put it in position 4? That's a new position (was position 2 in first guess). 
- E: we know it's in the word, put it at the end? But wait, in the first guess E was at position 5 and got '-', meaning E is not at position 5? So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again? Unless we are testing if there is another E? But let's avoid position 5 for E.

So if I put E in position 5 again, and if it is still '-' (meaning not at 5) that doesn't give new information. We already know E isn't at 5. So we should try E in a different position? Unless we suspect E is at 5? But the feedback says no.

So we must avoid E at position 5.

Therefore, ""STORE"" has E at position 5: bad.

Alternative: ""STERN"": 
- Positions: S (1), T (2), E (3), R (4), N (5). But wait, we were told that N is not in the word? Oh, no: we guessed N and it was 'x', so N is not in the word. So ""STERN"" has N -> we must avoid.

Another word: ""CREST""? But we also have C? We must avoid C. Guess had C and it was 'x', so C is out.

""TRIED"": 
- T, R, I, E, D -> contains R and E. R is in position 2? But in the first guess R was in position 2 and it was '-', meaning that position 2 is not R? So if I put R at position 2 again, and if the secret word has R somewhere else, it would still show '-'? Actually, if the secret word has R in position 2, then it would show '✓'. But since we know from first feedback that at position 2 it's not R, so if I guess R at position 2 again and if I get '-' again, that doesn't tell me anything new? So it's better to try R in a different position to see if it fits elsewhere.

So let me avoid position 2 for R? And we also avoid position 5 for E.

In ""TRIED"":
- T at 1
- R at 2 -> bad because same position as first guess? We don't want to repeat R at position 2 because we know it's not there? Actually, if I put R at 2 again and get '-' again, that doesn't give new information. Better to try R at a new position.

But wait: in ""TRIED"", E is at position 4? And D at the end.

Another word: ""GRIEF"": 
- G, R, I, E, F -> R is at position 2? Same issue.

How about ""MERRY""? But we don't want multiple R necessarily? The word could have repeating letters? But let's avoid for now? Also, we need 5 distinct? No, can have repeats.

But in this case, we are putting R at positions 2 and 3? And E at 4? That might be messy.

Better to try R at position 1. For example, ""ROUSE"":
- R at 1 (which wasn't guessed before? Actually, we guessed C at 1 so we don't know about R at 1)
- O at 2: new
- U at 3: new
- S at 4: new
- E at 5: but we must avoid E at 5? Because first guess said E is not at 5? So if we try E at 5 again, and it shows '-' that tells us E is still not at 5? But we already know E is not at 5? So no new information? Worse, if we put E at 5 and it becomes '✓', that would be new? But the first feedback said '-' for E at 5 meaning that the secret word has E but not at position 5? So E cannot be at position 5? Therefore, putting E at 5 again will definitely be '-', so we avoid? We should use E in a different position.

So let's avoid position 5 for E? We can put E at 1, 2, 3, 4? But note E wasn't tried elsewhere.

Word: ""RESET"": 
- R(1) E(2) S(3) E(4) T(5) -> but we have two E? Also, we put R at 1 and E at 2? But we don't know if E can be at 2? And we avoid E at 5? Wait T at 5 is new? But we have E also at 4? We are testing multiple E? But we don't know if we have one or two E? Since the first guess had E at 5 and got '-' meaning one E? Actually, '-' indicates that letter is present but in wrong position? It doesn't say how many? So there could be multiple E? However, we only got one '-' for E? That doesn't prevent another E? But possibly minimal? Let's stick to words without repeats?

But ""RESET"" has two E? Also, we have S and T which are new.

Alternatively, how about ""RISEN""? But we avoid N? So can't use N.

What about ""BRIEF"":
- B at 1
- R at 2 -> same position as first guess? We know R not at 2? So move?
- B at 1, R at 2 -> problem with R at 2.

We need a word where R is not at 2 and E is not at 5? And contains only letters that haven't been ruled out? Ruled out: C, A, N.

So: ""PRIZE""? But Z is uncommon? Also, we don't want Q, Z, X? Better common letters.

""TRIER"" ? R at 4? And E at 3? But T at 1? But ""TRIER"" has repeated R? Doesn't matter? But let me think.

Perhaps: ""ROUND""? But we avoid N? So skip.

""HEART""? But we avoid A? Because feedback said A is absent? And T? H? But ""HEART"": H E A R T -> A is absent? So skip.

Another idea: ""DOZER""? Avoid Z? And O?

Better: ""STELE""? Uncommon? Or ""TRICE"" -> avoid C.

Let me try to form a word: 
Let's put R at the beginning: R at position 1.
E at position 4? Then we need letters not ruled out? So positions: 1: R, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: E, 5: ?

Letters we haven't guessed: For position 2, we can use B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, etc.

For example: ""RULER"": 
- R at 1: good position? we don't know yet? 
- U at 2: new vowel?
- L at 3: new consonant?
- E at 4: new position? 
- R at 5: but R might be repeated? 

But ""RULER"" has two R: but we don't know if the word has repeated letters? However, we know R is present? If we don't get two R in the feedback, we'll know? So it's acceptable? Also avoids C,A,N.

But E is at position 4? Which is different from the previous guess at 5? So that's good.

Alternatively: ""RODEO"" avoid? It has only 5? But O repeated? And E? ""R O D E O"" -> the word must be English? And ""rodeo"" is a English word? But we don't know?

But let's consider more common words.

Another idea: ""PROBE""? P,R,O,B,E -> 
- R at position 2? Ah, same position as first guess? We should avoid R at position2? Because we know it's not R? So let's move R: position 2 is bad? Then put R at 1? Or 3? 

So ""PERIL"" might work? 
- P at 1, E at 2, R at 3? But R at 3: hasn't been guessed at that position? And E at 2: hasn't been guessed? 
- Positions: 1: P? 2: E? 3: R? 4: I? 5: L?

So we would be testing E at position 2? We don't know if it's there? And avoiding E at 5? Also, we have R at position 3? So not position2? Good? But wait: if E is at 2, it might be ok? But we don't have any information about position2 except it's not R? It could be E? Or not?

So ""PERIL"" might be a good choice? 

Or ""SERUM"": 
- S at 1, E at 2, R at 3? Same as above? Then U at4, M at5.

But same pattern? Let's choose ""PERIL""? Or ""METRO"": 
- M at1, E at2, T at3, R at4, O at5 -> but E is at2? And R at4.

But we avoid putting E at5? So that's fine? We have E at2? Which wasn't used?

However, note we don't have any feedback about position2? Only that it wasn't R? But we don't know if it is E? Or any other letter.

Another word: ""TREES""? Too many E? Avoid?

I think ""PERIL"" is a good choice? 

But let's see: we have R and E in new positions? Yes? 
- First guess: R at pos2? Now R at pos3? E was at pos5? Now E at pos2? 

Letters to cover: P, E, R, I, L? But I and L are vowels? Consonants? 

P is new, E we know is present? R we know is present? I is vowel? L is consonant? We haven tested P,I,L.

Alternatively, how about ""BLIER""? Uncommon? Or ""CRIER""? Avoid C.

""DRIVE"": D R at pos2? Avoid R at pos2? So no? Because we put R at pos2? We shouldn't put R at pos2? Because we know pos2 is not R? So we avoid pos2? Therefore, ""DRIVE"" has R at pos2? Discard.

So ""PERIL"" seems acceptable? Or ""MOVER"": M O V E R? V? And E at position4? And R at5? 

But V? Could be? 

But let me choose a word that has common letters? 

I think ""STEEL""? But double E? And E at position5? Avoid position5 for E? 

So I decide on ""PERIL"". 

But note: we guessed ""crane"": 
- R is present? But now we put R at position3? 
- E is present? But we put E at position2? 

It might be? 

Alternatively, ""STREW"": 
- S T R E W -> 
- Position2 is T? 
- Position3 is R? 
- Position4 is E? 
- Avoid position5 for E? Put E at4? 
- So: 1: S, 2: T, 3: R, 4: E, 5: W? Word ""strew""? 

But R is at position3? And E at position4? 

This avoids position2 for R and position5 for E? Also tested new letters: S, T, W? 

Also avoids C,A,N? 

I think that's a good candidate? 

Another option: ""BORED"" -> B O R E D? R at position3? E at position4? And avoid E at5? 
- Positions: B(1), O(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). Also avoids redundant position for R? 

Commonality? ""strew"" might be less common? 

Or ""GIVEN""? Avoid N? Cannot.

I think ""BORED"" is a good word? But does it have all common letters? 

Also ""TOGUE""? Uncommon? 

Let me go with ""BORED""? 

But we have O? Which is vowel? 

Another word: ""QUERY""? Q might be rare? 

So ""BORED"" sounds common? 

But let me look: 
- We know from feedback that the secret word has R and E? So if we put R and E in positions 3 and 4? But we haven't tested the positions? 

I think ""BORED"" is a reasonable second guess? 

But wait: could R be at position1? We haven't tested position1? So perhaps we should try R at position1? 

Similarly, E might be at position1? 

But we have B? Or T? etc. 

Let's choose a word with R at position1? For example, ""RADII""? Avoid A? Cannot. 

""ROBES"": 
- R O B E S? 
- R at1? 
- O at2? 
- B at3? 
- E at4? 
- S at5? 
Avoids E at5? 
Also avoids A,N? 

So ""ROBES""?

But O at2? We don't know? And E at4? 

This way we test R at position1? 

But we already know R is present? So if R is at position1 and we guess it, it will be '✓'? Or if not, '-' meaning it's elsewhere? 

We want to know the position? So testing R at position1 might be good? 

Similarly, E at4? 

Plus, letters O,B,S? 

I think ""ROBES"" is a good second guess? 

I'll go with that? 

But note: we haven't used S? And it's common? 

I think ""ROBES"" is a valid and reasonable guess? 

Therefore, my second guess is ""robes"". 

Wait, but let me confirm: 
- First guess: ""crane"" -> feedback C(x), R(-) meaning R is present but not at pos2? 
- Second guess: ""robes"" has R at position1? So if the secret word has R at position1, we get '✓' for that? If not, we get '-'? 

Also E at position4? If E is at position4, we get '✓'? Or if not? Since E is present but how? 

So it's a good test.

Thus, I choose ""ROBES"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)), we know:
- The secret word contains R and E, but R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5.
- The letters C, A, and N are absent from the word.
- R must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (positions not confirmed or tested properly yet).
- E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is incorrect).

For the second guess, we should:
1. Include R and E to verify their positions.
2. Avoid C, A, N entirely.
3. Use common letters to maximize information gain.
4. Preferably place R and E in new, untested positions (e.g., R not at position 2, E not at position 5).
5. Cover additional high-frequency letters like B, O, S, etc.

A suitable word is **""ROBES""**:
- R at position 1: Tests if R is in the first position (if correct ✓, or wrong ─ but we already know R is present).
- O at position 2: New vowel and position we have no information about.
- B at position 3: New consonant, tests another common letter.
- E at position 4: New position for E (not position 5).
- S at position 5: New consonant and position.

This guess efficiently checks potential positions for R and E while introducing three new letters (O, B, S) to gain more feedback.

<guess>robes</guess>",robes,"We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So we know:
- The secret word contains the letters 'R' and 'E', but not in the positions they were guessed (position 2 and 5 respectively).
- The letters 'C', 'A', 'N' are not in the word.

We must avoid using C, A, N in the next guess.

The word has 5 letters, and we know it has R and E, but we don't know their exact positions.

Let me think of a good second word that includes R and E (but not in position 2 for R, and not in position 5 for E) and avoids C, A, N.

Also, we want to cover new common letters to get more information.

Common consonants we haven't tried: S, T, L, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, etc.
Vowels: We have E, so we might want to try other vowels: O, U, I (but note we avoided A).

But note: 'R' is in the word, but not in position 2. So R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? Wait, position 5 was E with '-', meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. Similarly, R is not in position 2.

Let me denote positions: 1: C (x), 2: R (-), 3: A (x), 4: N (x), 5: E (-)

So:
- R must be in one of positions 1, 3, 4, but note:
  - Position 1: We had C (x) -> so R could be at position 1? Actually, position 1 was C, so R wasn't there? Wait, no: the feedback for R is '-', meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in position 1? But wait, position 1 is occupied by C, so if R was in position 1, it would have been marked as 'x' because we guessed a wrong letter? The feedback is per letter: the secret word doesn't have C in position 1? Actually, we know that the secret word might have R in position 1? Let me clarify.

Actually, the feedback symbol applies to each letter independently. For the first position, we guessed C and it was 'x', meaning the letter at that position is not C. The secret word could have any letter at that position - including R? Since we don't have any other information about position 1? Actually, if the secret word had R at position 1, then when we guessed C at 1 (which is wrong) and R at 2 (which is present elsewhere), then R at position 1 wouldn't be revealed because we didn't guess R in position 1. We only guessed R in position 2, so that R (at position 2) was compared to the secret word. Therefore, the secret word does have R, just not in position 2.

Similarly, E is in the word but not in position 5.

So possible positions for R: 1, 3, or 4 (but note position 3 and 4 we had A and N which are both absent, so R could be in 1, 3, or 4).

Wait, in positions 3 and 4 in the secret word? In the guess, position 3 was A and 4 was N, both 'x', meaning the secret word does not have A or N at any position? So, the secret word might have R in position 3? But then, since we guessed N at position 4, and it was missing, R could be in position 4? Or in position 1? And we guessed E at position 5 and it's present elsewhere.

So we need a word that:
- Includes R and E (both are present)
- Does not contain C, A, N
- And try to put R and E in new positions (not position 2 for R, not position 5 for E).

Let me list possible letters: We have used: C, R, A, N, E. Avoid C, A, N.

Common letters remaining: S, T, L, O, I, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, U, etc.

A good candidate word might be ""TRIES"" or ""ROGUE""? But we have to avoid A and N.

Let me think: we want to test R in a different position. Since position 2 was wrong, let's try putting R at position 1? Or position 3? But note: position 1 we don't know, so trying R at position 1 might be good? However, we also know E is present, but not at position 5.

Alternatively, we could try E in a different position (not 5).

Also, we want to cover new consonants and vowels.

The word ""STORE"" comes to mind: 
- S: new consonant
- T: new consonant
- O: new vowel
- R: we know it's in the word, put it in position 4? That's a new position (was position 2 in first guess). 
- E: we know it's in the word, put it at the end? But wait, in the first guess E was at position 5 and got '-', meaning E is not at position 5? So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again? Unless we are testing if there is another E? But let's avoid position 5 for E.

So if I put E in position 5 again, and if it is still '-' (meaning not at 5) that doesn't give new information. We already know E isn't at 5. So we should try E in a different position? Unless we suspect E is at 5? But the feedback says no.

So we must avoid E at position 5.

Therefore, ""STORE"" has E at position 5: bad.

Alternative: ""STERN"": 
- Positions: S (1), T (2), E (3), R (4), N (5). But wait, we were told that N is not in the word? Oh, no: we guessed N and it was 'x', so N is not in the word. So ""STERN"" has N -> we must avoid.

Another word: ""CREST""? But we also have C? We must avoid C. Guess had C and it was 'x', so C is out.

""TRIED"": 
- T, R, I, E, D -> contains R and E. R is in position 2? But in the first guess R was in position 2 and it was '-', meaning that position 2 is not R? So if I put R at position 2 again, and if the secret word has R somewhere else, it would still show '-'? Actually, if the secret word has R in position 2, then it would show '✓'. But since we know from first feedback that at position 2 it's not R, so if I guess R at position 2 again and if I get '-' again, that doesn't tell me anything new? So it's better to try R in a different position to see if it fits elsewhere.

So let me avoid position 2 for R? And we also avoid position 5 for E.

In ""TRIED"":
- T at 1
- R at 2 -> bad because same position as first guess? We don't want to repeat R at position 2 because we know it's not there? Actually, if I put R at 2 again and get '-' again, that doesn't give new information. Better to try R at a new position.

But wait: in ""TRIED"", E is at position 4? And D at the end.

Another word: ""GRIEF"": 
- G, R, I, E, F -> R is at position 2? Same issue.

How about ""MERRY""? But we don't want multiple R necessarily? The word could have repeating letters? But let's avoid for now? Also, we need 5 distinct? No, can have repeats.

But in this case, we are putting R at positions 2 and 3? And E at 4? That might be messy.

Better to try R at position 1. For example, ""ROUSE"":
- R at 1 (which wasn't guessed before? Actually, we guessed C at 1 so we don't know about R at 1)
- O at 2: new
- U at 3: new
- S at 4: new
- E at 5: but we must avoid E at 5? Because first guess said E is not at 5? So if we try E at 5 again, and it shows '-' that tells us E is still not at 5? But we already know E is not at 5? So no new information? Worse, if we put E at 5 and it becomes '✓', that would be new? But the first feedback said '-' for E at 5 meaning that the secret word has E but not at position 5? So E cannot be at position 5? Therefore, putting E at 5 again will definitely be '-', so we avoid? We should use E in a different position.

So let's avoid position 5 for E? We can put E at 1, 2, 3, 4? But note E wasn't tried elsewhere.

Word: ""RESET"": 
- R(1) E(2) S(3) E(4) T(5) -> but we have two E? Also, we put R at 1 and E at 2? But we don't know if E can be at 2? And we avoid E at 5? Wait T at 5 is new? But we have E also at 4? We are testing multiple E? But we don't know if we have one or two E? Since the first guess had E at 5 and got '-' meaning one E? Actually, '-' indicates that letter is present but in wrong position? It doesn't say how many? So there could be multiple E? However, we only got one '-' for E? That doesn't prevent another E? But possibly minimal? Let's stick to words without repeats?

But ""RESET"" has two E? Also, we have S and T which are new.

Alternatively, how about ""RISEN""? But we avoid N? So can't use N.

What about ""BRIEF"":
- B at 1
- R at 2 -> same position as first guess? We know R not at 2? So move?
- B at 1, R at 2 -> problem with R at 2.

We need a word where R is not at 2 and E is not at 5? And contains only letters that haven't been ruled out? Ruled out: C, A, N.

So: ""PRIZE""? But Z is uncommon? Also, we don't want Q, Z, X? Better common letters.

""TRIER"" ? R at 4? And E at 3? But T at 1? But ""TRIER"" has repeated R? Doesn't matter? But let me think.

Perhaps: ""ROUND""? But we avoid N? So skip.

""HEART""? But we avoid A? Because feedback said A is absent? And T? H? But ""HEART"": H E A R T -> A is absent? So skip.

Another idea: ""DOZER""? Avoid Z? And O?

Better: ""STELE""? Uncommon? Or ""TRICE"" -> avoid C.

Let me try to form a word: 
Let's put R at the beginning: R at position 1.
E at position 4? Then we need letters not ruled out? So positions: 1: R, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: E, 5: ?

Letters we haven't guessed: For position 2, we can use B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, etc.

For example: ""RULER"": 
- R at 1: good position? we don't know yet? 
- U at 2: new vowel?
- L at 3: new consonant?
- E at 4: new position? 
- R at 5: but R might be repeated? 

But ""RULER"" has two R: but we don't know if the word has repeated letters? However, we know R is present? If we don't get two R in the feedback, we'll know? So it's acceptable? Also avoids C,A,N.

But E is at position 4? Which is different from the previous guess at 5? So that's good.

Alternatively: ""RODEO"" avoid? It has only 5? But O repeated? And E? ""R O D E O"" -> the word must be English? And ""rodeo"" is a English word? But we don't know?

But let's consider more common words.

Another idea: ""PROBE""? P,R,O,B,E -> 
- R at position 2? Ah, same position as first guess? We should avoid R at position2? Because we know it's not R? So let's move R: position 2 is bad? Then put R at 1? Or 3? 

So ""PERIL"" might work? 
- P at 1, E at 2, R at 3? But R at 3: hasn't been guessed at that position? And E at 2: hasn't been guessed? 
- Positions: 1: P? 2: E? 3: R? 4: I? 5: L?

So we would be testing E at position 2? We don't know if it's there? And avoiding E at 5? Also, we have R at position 3? So not position2? Good? But wait: if E is at 2, it might be ok? But we don't have any information about position2 except it's not R? It could be E? Or not?

So ""PERIL"" might be a good choice? 

Or ""SERUM"": 
- S at 1, E at 2, R at 3? Same as above? Then U at4, M at5.

But same pattern? Let's choose ""PERIL""? Or ""METRO"": 
- M at1, E at2, T at3, R at4, O at5 -> but E is at2? And R at4.

But we avoid putting E at5? So that's fine? We have E at2? Which wasn't used?

However, note we don't have any feedback about position2? Only that it wasn't R? But we don't know if it is E? Or any other letter.

Another word: ""TREES""? Too many E? Avoid?

I think ""PERIL"" is a good choice? 

But let's see: we have R and E in new positions? Yes? 
- First guess: R at pos2? Now R at pos3? E was at pos5? Now E at pos2? 

Letters to cover: P, E, R, I, L? But I and L are vowels? Consonants? 

P is new, E we know is present? R we know is present? I is vowel? L is consonant? We haven tested P,I,L.

Alternatively, how about ""BLIER""? Uncommon? Or ""CRIER""? Avoid C.

""DRIVE"": D R at pos2? Avoid R at pos2? So no? Because we put R at pos2? We shouldn't put R at pos2? Because we know pos2 is not R? So we avoid pos2? Therefore, ""DRIVE"" has R at pos2? Discard.

So ""PERIL"" seems acceptable? Or ""MOVER"": M O V E R? V? And E at position4? And R at5? 

But V? Could be? 

But let me choose a word that has common letters? 

I think ""STEEL""? But double E? And E at position5? Avoid position5 for E? 

So I decide on ""PERIL"". 

But note: we guessed ""crane"": 
- R is present? But now we put R at position3? 
- E is present? But we put E at position2? 

It might be? 

Alternatively, ""STREW"": 
- S T R E W -> 
- Position2 is T? 
- Position3 is R? 
- Position4 is E? 
- Avoid position5 for E? Put E at4? 
- So: 1: S, 2: T, 3: R, 4: E, 5: W? Word ""strew""? 

But R is at position3? And E at position4? 

This avoids position2 for R and position5 for E? Also tested new letters: S, T, W? 

Also avoids C,A,N? 

I think that's a good candidate? 

Another option: ""BORED"" -> B O R E D? R at position3? E at position4? And avoid E at5? 
- Positions: B(1), O(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). Also avoids redundant position for R? 

Commonality? ""strew"" might be less common? 

Or ""GIVEN""? Avoid N? Cannot.

I think ""BORED"" is a good word? But does it have all common letters? 

Also ""TOGUE""? Uncommon? 

Let me go with ""BORED""? 

But we have O? Which is vowel? 

Another word: ""QUERY""? Q might be rare? 

So ""BORED"" sounds common? 

But let me look: 
- We know from feedback that the secret word has R and E? So if we put R and E in positions 3 and 4? But we haven't tested the positions? 

I think ""BORED"" is a reasonable second guess? 

But wait: could R be at position1? We haven't tested position1? So perhaps we should try R at position1? 

Similarly, E might be at position1? 

But we have B? Or T? etc. 

Let's choose a word with R at position1? For example, ""RADII""? Avoid A? Cannot. 

""ROBES"": 
- R O B E S? 
- R at1? 
- O at2? 
- B at3? 
- E at4? 
- S at5? 
Avoids E at5? 
Also avoids A,N? 

So ""ROBES""?

But O at2? We don't know? And E at4? 

This way we test R at position1? 

But we already know R is present? So if R is at position1 and we guess it, it will be '✓'? Or if not, '-' meaning it's elsewhere? 

We want to know the position? So testing R at position1 might be good? 

Similarly, E at4? 

Plus, letters O,B,S? 

I think ""ROBES"" is a good second guess? 

I'll go with that? 

But note: we haven't used S? And it's common? 

I think ""ROBES"" is a valid and reasonable guess? 

Therefore, my second guess is ""robes"". 

Wait, but let me confirm: 
- First guess: ""crane"" -> feedback C(x), R(-) meaning R is present but not at pos2? 
- Second guess: ""robes"" has R at position1? So if the secret word has R at position1, we get '✓' for that? If not, we get '-'? 

Also E at position4? If E is at position4, we get '✓'? Or if not? Since E is present but how? 

So it's a good test.

Thus, I choose ""ROBES"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)), we know:
- The secret word contains R and E, but R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5.
- The letters C, A, and N are absent from the word.
- R must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (positions not confirmed or tested properly yet).
- E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is incorrect).

For the second guess, we should:
1. Include R and E to verify their positions.
2. Avoid C, A, N entirely.
3. Use common letters to maximize information gain.
4. Preferably place R and E in new, untested positions (e.g., R not at position 2, E not at position 5).
5. Cover additional high-frequency letters like B, O, S, etc.

A suitable word is **""ROBES""**:
- R at position 1: Tests if R is in the first position (if correct ✓, or wrong ─ but we already know R is present).
- O at position 2: New vowel and position we have no information about.
- B at position 3: New consonant, tests another common letter.
- E at position 4: New position for E (not position 5).
- S at position 5: New consonant and position.

This guess efficiently checks potential positions for R and E while introducing three new letters (O, B, S) to gain more feedback.",Guess 2: robes -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) B(x) E(-) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,LEERY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So we know:
- The secret word contains the letters 'R' and 'E', but not in the positions they were guessed (position 2 and 5 respectively).
- The letters 'C', 'A', 'N' are not in the word.

We must avoid using C, A, N in the next guess.

The word has 5 letters, and we know it has R and E, but we don't know their exact positions.

Let me think of a good second word that includes R and E (but not in position 2 for R, and not in position 5 for E) and avoids C, A, N.

Also, we want to cover new common letters to get more information.

Common consonants we haven't tried: S, T, L, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, etc.
Vowels: We have E, so we might want to try other vowels: O, U, I (but note we avoided A).

But note: 'R' is in the word, but not in position 2. So R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? Wait, position 5 was E with '-', meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. Similarly, R is not in position 2.

Let me denote positions: 1: C (x), 2: R (-), 3: A (x), 4: N (x), 5: E (-)

So:
- R must be in one of positions 1, 3, 4, but note:
  - Position 1: We had C (x) -> so R could be at position 1? Actually, position 1 was C, so R wasn't there? Wait, no: the feedback for R is '-', meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in position 1? But wait, position 1 is occupied by C, so if R was in position 1, it would have been marked as 'x' because we guessed a wrong letter? The feedback is per letter: the secret word doesn't have C in position 1? Actually, we know that the secret word might have R in position 1? Let me clarify.

Actually, the feedback symbol applies to each letter independently. For the first position, we guessed C and it was 'x', meaning the letter at that position is not C. The secret word could have any letter at that position - including R? Since we don't have any other information about position 1? Actually, if the secret word had R at position 1, then when we guessed C at 1 (which is wrong) and R at 2 (which is present elsewhere), then R at position 1 wouldn't be revealed because we didn't guess R in position 1. We only guessed R in position 2, so that R (at position 2) was compared to the secret word. Therefore, the secret word does have R, just not in position 2.

Similarly, E is in the word but not in position 5.

So possible positions for R: 1, 3, or 4 (but note position 3 and 4 we had A and N which are both absent, so R could be in 1, 3, or 4).

Wait, in positions 3 and 4 in the secret word? In the guess, position 3 was A and 4 was N, both 'x', meaning the secret word does not have A or N at any position? So, the secret word might have R in position 3? But then, since we guessed N at position 4, and it was missing, R could be in position 4? Or in position 1? And we guessed E at position 5 and it's present elsewhere.

So we need a word that:
- Includes R and E (both are present)
- Does not contain C, A, N
- And try to put R and E in new positions (not position 2 for R, not position 5 for E).

Let me list possible letters: We have used: C, R, A, N, E. Avoid C, A, N.

Common letters remaining: S, T, L, O, I, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, U, etc.

A good candidate word might be ""TRIES"" or ""ROGUE""? But we have to avoid A and N.

Let me think: we want to test R in a different position. Since position 2 was wrong, let's try putting R at position 1? Or position 3? But note: position 1 we don't know, so trying R at position 1 might be good? However, we also know E is present, but not at position 5.

Alternatively, we could try E in a different position (not 5).

Also, we want to cover new consonants and vowels.

The word ""STORE"" comes to mind: 
- S: new consonant
- T: new consonant
- O: new vowel
- R: we know it's in the word, put it in position 4? That's a new position (was position 2 in first guess). 
- E: we know it's in the word, put it at the end? But wait, in the first guess E was at position 5 and got '-', meaning E is not at position 5? So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again? Unless we are testing if there is another E? But let's avoid position 5 for E.

So if I put E in position 5 again, and if it is still '-' (meaning not at 5) that doesn't give new information. We already know E isn't at 5. So we should try E in a different position? Unless we suspect E is at 5? But the feedback says no.

So we must avoid E at position 5.

Therefore, ""STORE"" has E at position 5: bad.

Alternative: ""STERN"": 
- Positions: S (1), T (2), E (3), R (4), N (5). But wait, we were told that N is not in the word? Oh, no: we guessed N and it was 'x', so N is not in the word. So ""STERN"" has N -> we must avoid.

Another word: ""CREST""? But we also have C? We must avoid C. Guess had C and it was 'x', so C is out.

""TRIED"": 
- T, R, I, E, D -> contains R and E. R is in position 2? But in the first guess R was in position 2 and it was '-', meaning that position 2 is not R? So if I put R at position 2 again, and if the secret word has R somewhere else, it would still show '-'? Actually, if the secret word has R in position 2, then it would show '✓'. But since we know from first feedback that at position 2 it's not R, so if I guess R at position 2 again and if I get '-' again, that doesn't tell me anything new? So it's better to try R in a different position to see if it fits elsewhere.

So let me avoid position 2 for R? And we also avoid position 5 for E.

In ""TRIED"":
- T at 1
- R at 2 -> bad because same position as first guess? We don't want to repeat R at position 2 because we know it's not there? Actually, if I put R at 2 again and get '-' again, that doesn't give new information. Better to try R at a new position.

But wait: in ""TRIED"", E is at position 4? And D at the end.

Another word: ""GRIEF"": 
- G, R, I, E, F -> R is at position 2? Same issue.

How about ""MERRY""? But we don't want multiple R necessarily? The word could have repeating letters? But let's avoid for now? Also, we need 5 distinct? No, can have repeats.

But in this case, we are putting R at positions 2 and 3? And E at 4? That might be messy.

Better to try R at position 1. For example, ""ROUSE"":
- R at 1 (which wasn't guessed before? Actually, we guessed C at 1 so we don't know about R at 1)
- O at 2: new
- U at 3: new
- S at 4: new
- E at 5: but we must avoid E at 5? Because first guess said E is not at 5? So if we try E at 5 again, and it shows '-' that tells us E is still not at 5? But we already know E is not at 5? So no new information? Worse, if we put E at 5 and it becomes '✓', that would be new? But the first feedback said '-' for E at 5 meaning that the secret word has E but not at position 5? So E cannot be at position 5? Therefore, putting E at 5 again will definitely be '-', so we avoid? We should use E in a different position.

So let's avoid position 5 for E? We can put E at 1, 2, 3, 4? But note E wasn't tried elsewhere.

Word: ""RESET"": 
- R(1) E(2) S(3) E(4) T(5) -> but we have two E? Also, we put R at 1 and E at 2? But we don't know if E can be at 2? And we avoid E at 5? Wait T at 5 is new? But we have E also at 4? We are testing multiple E? But we don't know if we have one or two E? Since the first guess had E at 5 and got '-' meaning one E? Actually, '-' indicates that letter is present but in wrong position? It doesn't say how many? So there could be multiple E? However, we only got one '-' for E? That doesn't prevent another E? But possibly minimal? Let's stick to words without repeats?

But ""RESET"" has two E? Also, we have S and T which are new.

Alternatively, how about ""RISEN""? But we avoid N? So can't use N.

What about ""BRIEF"":
- B at 1
- R at 2 -> same position as first guess? We know R not at 2? So move?
- B at 1, R at 2 -> problem with R at 2.

We need a word where R is not at 2 and E is not at 5? And contains only letters that haven't been ruled out? Ruled out: C, A, N.

So: ""PRIZE""? But Z is uncommon? Also, we don't want Q, Z, X? Better common letters.

""TRIER"" ? R at 4? And E at 3? But T at 1? But ""TRIER"" has repeated R? Doesn't matter? But let me think.

Perhaps: ""ROUND""? But we avoid N? So skip.

""HEART""? But we avoid A? Because feedback said A is absent? And T? H? But ""HEART"": H E A R T -> A is absent? So skip.

Another idea: ""DOZER""? Avoid Z? And O?

Better: ""STELE""? Uncommon? Or ""TRICE"" -> avoid C.

Let me try to form a word: 
Let's put R at the beginning: R at position 1.
E at position 4? Then we need letters not ruled out? So positions: 1: R, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: E, 5: ?

Letters we haven't guessed: For position 2, we can use B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, etc.

For example: ""RULER"": 
- R at 1: good position? we don't know yet? 
- U at 2: new vowel?
- L at 3: new consonant?
- E at 4: new position? 
- R at 5: but R might be repeated? 

But ""RULER"" has two R: but we don't know if the word has repeated letters? However, we know R is present? If we don't get two R in the feedback, we'll know? So it's acceptable? Also avoids C,A,N.

But E is at position 4? Which is different from the previous guess at 5? So that's good.

Alternatively: ""RODEO"" avoid? It has only 5? But O repeated? And E? ""R O D E O"" -> the word must be English? And ""rodeo"" is a English word? But we don't know?

But let's consider more common words.

Another idea: ""PROBE""? P,R,O,B,E -> 
- R at position 2? Ah, same position as first guess? We should avoid R at position2? Because we know it's not R? So let's move R: position 2 is bad? Then put R at 1? Or 3? 

So ""PERIL"" might work? 
- P at 1, E at 2, R at 3? But R at 3: hasn't been guessed at that position? And E at 2: hasn't been guessed? 
- Positions: 1: P? 2: E? 3: R? 4: I? 5: L?

So we would be testing E at position 2? We don't know if it's there? And avoiding E at 5? Also, we have R at position 3? So not position2? Good? But wait: if E is at 2, it might be ok? But we don't have any information about position2 except it's not R? It could be E? Or not?

So ""PERIL"" might be a good choice? 

Or ""SERUM"": 
- S at 1, E at 2, R at 3? Same as above? Then U at4, M at5.

But same pattern? Let's choose ""PERIL""? Or ""METRO"": 
- M at1, E at2, T at3, R at4, O at5 -> but E is at2? And R at4.

But we avoid putting E at5? So that's fine? We have E at2? Which wasn't used?

However, note we don't have any feedback about position2? Only that it wasn't R? But we don't know if it is E? Or any other letter.

Another word: ""TREES""? Too many E? Avoid?

I think ""PERIL"" is a good choice? 

But let's see: we have R and E in new positions? Yes? 
- First guess: R at pos2? Now R at pos3? E was at pos5? Now E at pos2? 

Letters to cover: P, E, R, I, L? But I and L are vowels? Consonants? 

P is new, E we know is present? R we know is present? I is vowel? L is consonant? We haven tested P,I,L.

Alternatively, how about ""BLIER""? Uncommon? Or ""CRIER""? Avoid C.

""DRIVE"": D R at pos2? Avoid R at pos2? So no? Because we put R at pos2? We shouldn't put R at pos2? Because we know pos2 is not R? So we avoid pos2? Therefore, ""DRIVE"" has R at pos2? Discard.

So ""PERIL"" seems acceptable? Or ""MOVER"": M O V E R? V? And E at position4? And R at5? 

But V? Could be? 

But let me choose a word that has common letters? 

I think ""STEEL""? But double E? And E at position5? Avoid position5 for E? 

So I decide on ""PERIL"". 

But note: we guessed ""crane"": 
- R is present? But now we put R at position3? 
- E is present? But we put E at position2? 

It might be? 

Alternatively, ""STREW"": 
- S T R E W -> 
- Position2 is T? 
- Position3 is R? 
- Position4 is E? 
- Avoid position5 for E? Put E at4? 
- So: 1: S, 2: T, 3: R, 4: E, 5: W? Word ""strew""? 

But R is at position3? And E at position4? 

This avoids position2 for R and position5 for E? Also tested new letters: S, T, W? 

Also avoids C,A,N? 

I think that's a good candidate? 

Another option: ""BORED"" -> B O R E D? R at position3? E at position4? And avoid E at5? 
- Positions: B(1), O(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). Also avoids redundant position for R? 

Commonality? ""strew"" might be less common? 

Or ""GIVEN""? Avoid N? Cannot.

I think ""BORED"" is a good word? But does it have all common letters? 

Also ""TOGUE""? Uncommon? 

Let me go with ""BORED""? 

But we have O? Which is vowel? 

Another word: ""QUERY""? Q might be rare? 

So ""BORED"" sounds common? 

But let me look: 
- We know from feedback that the secret word has R and E? So if we put R and E in positions 3 and 4? But we haven't tested the positions? 

I think ""BORED"" is a reasonable second guess? 

But wait: could R be at position1? We haven't tested position1? So perhaps we should try R at position1? 

Similarly, E might be at position1? 

But we have B? Or T? etc. 

Let's choose a word with R at position1? For example, ""RADII""? Avoid A? Cannot. 

""ROBES"": 
- R O B E S? 
- R at1? 
- O at2? 
- B at3? 
- E at4? 
- S at5? 
Avoids E at5? 
Also avoids A,N? 

So ""ROBES""?

But O at2? We don't know? And E at4? 

This way we test R at position1? 

But we already know R is present? So if R is at position1 and we guess it, it will be '✓'? Or if not, '-' meaning it's elsewhere? 

We want to know the position? So testing R at position1 might be good? 

Similarly, E at4? 

Plus, letters O,B,S? 

I think ""ROBES"" is a good second guess? 

I'll go with that? 

But note: we haven't used S? And it's common? 

I think ""ROBES"" is a valid and reasonable guess? 

Therefore, my second guess is ""robes"". 

Wait, but let me confirm: 
- First guess: ""crane"" -> feedback C(x), R(-) meaning R is present but not at pos2? 
- Second guess: ""robes"" has R at position1? So if the secret word has R at position1, we get '✓' for that? If not, we get '-'? 

Also E at position4? If E is at position4, we get '✓'? Or if not? Since E is present but how? 

So it's a good test.

Thus, I choose ""ROBES"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)), we know:
- The secret word contains R and E, but R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5.
- The letters C, A, and N are absent from the word.
- R must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (positions not confirmed or tested properly yet).
- E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is incorrect).

For the second guess, we should:
1. Include R and E to verify their positions.
2. Avoid C, A, N entirely.
3. Use common letters to maximize information gain.
4. Preferably place R and E in new, untested positions (e.g., R not at position 2, E not at position 5).
5. Cover additional high-frequency letters like B, O, S, etc.

A suitable word is **""ROBES""**:
- R at position 1: Tests if R is in the first position (if correct ✓, or wrong ─ but we already know R is present).
- O at position 2: New vowel and position we have no information about.
- B at position 3: New consonant, tests another common letter.
- E at position 4: New position for E (not position 5).
- S at position 5: New consonant and position.

This guess efficiently checks potential positions for R and E while introducing three new letters (O, B, S) to gain more feedback.

So R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? Wait, position 5 was E with \'-\', meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. Similarly, R is not in position 2.\n\nLet me denote positions: 1: C (x), 2: R (-), 3: A (x), 4: N (x), 5: E (-)\n\nSo:\n- R must be in one of positions 1, 3, 4, but note:\n  - Position 1: We had C (x) -> so R could be at position 1? Actually, position 1 was C, so R wasn\'t there? Wait, no: the feedback for R is \'-\', meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in position 1? But wait, position 1 is occupied by C, so if R was in position 1, it would have been marked as \'x\' because we guessed a wrong letter? The feedback is per letter: the secret word doesn\'t have C in position 1? Actually, we know that the secret word might have R in position 1? Let me clarify.\n\nActually, the feedback symbol applies to each letter independently. For the first position, we guessed C and it was \'x\', meaning the letter at that position is not C. The secret word could have any letter at that position - including R? Since we don\'t have any other information about position 1? Actually, if the secret word had R at position 1, then when we guessed C at 1 (which is wrong) and R at 2 (which is present elsewhere), then R at position 1 wouldn\'t be revealed because we didn\'t guess R in position 1. We only guessed R in position 2, so that R (at position 2) was compared to the secret word. Therefore, the secret word does have R, just not in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nSo possible positions for R: 1, 3, or 4 (but note position 3 and 4 we had A and N which are both absent, so R could be in 1, 3, or 4).\n\nWait, in positions 3 and 4 in the secret word? In the guess, position 3 was A and 4 was N, both \'x\', meaning the secret word does not have A or N at any position? So, the secret word might have R in position 3? But then, since we guessed N at position 4, and it was missing, R could be in position 4? Or in position 1? And we guessed E at position 5 and it\'s present elsewhere.\n\nSo we need a word that:\n- Includes R and E (both are present)\n- Does not contain C, A, N\n- And try to put R and E in new positions (not position 2 for R, not position 5 for E).\n\nLet me list possible letters: We have used: C, R, A, N, E. Avoid C, A, N.\n\nCommon letters remaining: S, T, L, O, I, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, U, etc.\n\nA good candidate word might be ""TRIES"" or ""ROGUE""? But we have to avoid A and N.\n\nLet me think: we want to test R in a different position. Since position 2 was wrong, let\'s try putting R at position 1? Or position 3? But note: position 1 we don\'t know, so trying R at position 1 might be good? However, we also know E is present, but not at position 5.\n\nAlternatively, we could try E in a different position (not 5).\n\nAlso, we want to cover new consonants and vowels.\n\nThe word ""STORE"" comes to mind: \n- S: new consonant\n- T: new consonant\n- O: new vowel\n- R: we know it\'s in the word, put it in position 4? That\'s a new position (was position 2 in first guess). \n- E: we know it\'s in the word, put it at the end? But wait, in the first guess E was at position 5 and got \'-\', meaning E is not at position 5? So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again? Unless we are testing if there is another E? But let\'s avoid position 5 for E.\n\nSo if I put E in position 5 again, and if it is still \'-\' (meaning not at 5) that doesn\'t give new information. We already know E isn\'t at 5. So we should try E in a different position? Unless we suspect E is at 5? But the feedback says no.\n\nSo we must avoid E at position 5.\n\nTherefore, ""STORE"" has E at position 5: bad.\n\nAlternative: ""STERN"": \n- Positions: S (1), T (2), E (3), R (4), N (5). But wait, we were told that N is not in the word? Oh, no: we guessed N and it was \'x\', so N is not in the word. So ""STERN"" has N -> we must avoid.\n\nAnother word: ""CREST""? But we also have C? We must avoid C. Guess had C and it was \'x\', so C is out.\n\n""TRIED"": \n- T, R, I, E, D -> contains R and E. R is in position 2? But in the first guess R was in position 2 and it was \'-\', meaning that position 2 is not R? So if I put R at position 2 again, and if the secret word has R somewhere else, it would still show \'-\'? Actually, if the secret word has R in position 2, then it would show \'✓\'. But since we know from first feedback that at position 2 it\'s not R, so if I guess R at position 2 again and if I get \'-\' again, that doesn\'t tell me anything new? So it\'s better to try R in a different position to see if it fits elsewhere.\n\nSo let me avoid position 2 for R? And we also avoid position 5 for E.\n\nIn ""TRIED"":\n- T at 1\n- R at 2 -> bad because same position as first guess? We don\'t want to repeat R at position 2 because we know it\'s not there? Actually, if I put R at 2 again and get \'-\' again, that doesn\'t give new information. Better to try R at a new position.\n\nBut wait: in ""TRIED"", E is at position 4? And D at the end.\n\nAnother word: ""GRIEF"": \n- G, R, I, E, F -> R is at position 2? Same issue.\n\nHow about ""MERRY""? But we don\'t want multiple R necessarily? The word could have repeating letters? But let\'s avoid for now? Also, we need 5 distinct? No, can have repeats.\n\nBut in this case, we are putting R at positions 2 and 3? And E at 4? That might be messy.\n\nBetter to try R at position 1. For example, ""ROUSE"":\n- R at 1 (which wasn\'t guessed before? Actually, we guessed C at 1 so we don\'t know about R at 1)\n- O at 2: new\n- U at 3: new\n- S at 4: new\n- E at 5: but we must avoid E at 5? Because first guess said E is not at 5? So if we try E at 5 again, and it shows \'-\' that tells us E is still not at 5? But we already know E is not at 5? So no new information? Worse, if we put E at 5 and it becomes \'✓\', that would be new? But the first feedback said \'-\' for E at 5 meaning that the secret word has E but not at position 5? So E cannot be at position 5? Therefore, putting E at 5 again will definitely be \'-\', so we avoid? We should use E in a different position.\n\nSo let\'s avoid position 5 for E? We can put E at 1, 2, 3, 4? But note E wasn\'t tried elsewhere.\n\nWord: ""RESET"": \n- R(1) E(2) S(3) E(4) T(5) -> but we have two E? Also, we put R at 1 and E at 2? But we don\'t know if E can be at 2? And we avoid E at 5? Wait T at 5 is new? But we have E also at 4? We are testing multiple E? But we don\'t know if we have one or two E? Since the first guess had E at 5 and got \'-\' meaning one E? Actually, \'-\' indicates that letter is present but in wrong position? It doesn\'t say how many? So there could be multiple E? However, we only got one \'-\' for E? That doesn\'t prevent another E? But possibly minimal? Let\'s stick to words without repeats?\n\nBut ""RESET"" has two E? Also, we have S and T which are new.\n\nAlternatively, how about ""RISEN""? But we avoid N? So can\'t use N.\n\nWhat about ""BRIEF"":\n- B at 1\n- R at 2 -> same position as first guess? We know R not at 2? So move?\n- B at 1, R at 2 -> problem with R at 2.\n\nWe need a word where R is not at 2 and E is not at 5? And contains only letters that haven\'t been ruled out? Ruled out: C, A, N.\n\nSo: ""PRIZE""? But Z is uncommon? Also, we don\'t want Q, Z, X? Better common letters.\n\n""TRIER"" ? R at 4? And E at 3? But T at 1? But ""TRIER"" has repeated R? Doesn\'t matter? But let me think.\n\nPerhaps: ""ROUND""? But we avoid N? So skip.\n\n""HEART""? But we avoid A? Because feedback said A is absent? And T? H? But ""HEART"": H E A R T -> A is absent? So skip.\n\nAnother idea: ""DOZER""? Avoid Z? And O?\n\nBetter: ""STELE""? Uncommon? Or ""TRICE"" -> avoid C.\n\nLet me try to form a word: \nLet\'s put R at the beginning: R at position 1.\nE at position 4? Then we need letters not ruled out? So positions: 1: R, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: E, 5: ?\n\nLetters we haven\'t guessed: For position 2, we can use B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, etc.\n\nFor example: ""RULER"": \n- R at 1: good position? we don\'t know yet? \n- U at 2: new vowel?\n- L at 3: new consonant?\n- E at 4: new position? \n- R at 5: but R might be repeated? \n\nBut ""RULER"" has two R: but we don\'t know if the word has repeated letters? However, we know R is present? If we don\'t get two R in the feedback, we\'ll know? So it\'s acceptable? Also avoids C,A,N.\n\nBut E is at position 4? Which is different from the previous guess at 5? So that\'s good.\n\nAlternatively: ""RODEO"" avoid? It has only 5? But O repeated? And E? ""R O D E O"" -> the word must be English? And ""rodeo"" is a English word? But we don\'t know?\n\nBut let\'s consider more common words.\n\nAnother idea: ""PROBE""? P,R,O,B,E -> \n- R at position 2? Ah, same position as first guess? We should avoid R at position2? Because we know it\'s not R? So let\'s move R: position 2 is bad? Then put R at 1? Or 3? \n\nSo ""PERIL"" might work? \n- P at 1, E at 2, R at 3? But R at 3: hasn\'t been guessed at that position? And E at 2: hasn\'t been guessed? \n- Positions: 1: P? 2: E? 3: R? 4: I? 5: L?\n\nSo we would be testing E at position 2? We don\'t know if it\'s there? And avoiding E at 5? Also, we have R at position 3? So not position2? Good? But wait: if E is at 2, it might be ok? But we don\'t have any information about position2 except it\'s not R? It could be E? Or not?\n\nSo ""PERIL"" might be a good choice? \n\nOr ""SERUM"": \n- S at 1, E at 2, R at 3? Same as above? Then U at4, M at5.\n\nBut same pattern? Let\'s choose ""PERIL""? Or ""METRO"": \n- M at1, E at2, T at3, R at4, O at5 -> but E is at2? And R at4.\n\nBut we avoid putting E at5? So that\'s fine? We have E at2? Which wasn\'t used?\n\nHowever, note we don\'t have any feedback about position2? Only that it wasn\'t R? But we don\'t know if it is E? Or any other letter.\n\nAnother word: ""TREES""? Too many E? Avoid?\n\nI think ""PERIL"" is a good choice? \n\nBut let\'s see: we have R and E in new positions? Yes? \n- First guess: R at pos2? Now R at pos3? E was at pos5? Now E at pos2? \n\nLetters to cover: P, E, R, I, L? But I and L are vowels? Consonants? \n\nP is new, E we know is present? R we know is present? I is vowel? L is consonant? We haven tested P,I,L.\n\nAlternatively, how about ""BLIER""? Uncommon? Or ""CRIER""? Avoid C.\n\n""DRIVE"": D R at pos2? Avoid R at pos2? So no? Because we put R at pos2? We shouldn\'t put R at pos2? Because we know pos2 is not R? So we avoid pos2? Therefore, ""DRIVE"" has R at pos2? Discard.\n\nSo ""PERIL"" seems acceptable? Or ""MOVER"": M O V E R? V? And E at position4? And R at5? \n\nBut V? Could be? \n\nBut let me choose a word that has common letters? \n\nI think ""STEEL""? But double E? And E at position5? Avoid position5 for E? \n\nSo I decide on ""PERIL"". \n\nBut note: we guessed ""crane"": \n- R is present? But now we put R at position3? \n- E is present? But we put E at position2? \n\nIt might be? \n\nAlternatively, ""STREW"": \n- S T R E W -> \n- Position2 is T? \n- Position3 is R? \n- Position4 is E? \n- Avoid position5 for E?

- R's position: Cannot be position 1 (from robes feedback) or position 2 (from crane feedback). So R must be in position 3 or 4 (since position 5 is possible? Wait, positions are 1-5. We've ruled out 1 and 2, so R in 3,4, or possibly 5? But note: crane had R at position 2, which was wrong, but we didn't rule out position 5 for R? We need to consider all positions).

Specifically for R:
- From crane: R is in the word, not at pos2.
- From robes: R is in the word, not at pos1.
So R must be at position 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly for E:
- From crane: E is in the word, not at pos5.
- From robes: E is in the word, not at pos4.
So E must be at position 1, 2, or 3.

Also, note that the secret word has only the letters we know (R and E) plus three other letters that must be among the remaining unused letters? And we have ruled out: C, A, N, O, B, S. So these are not in the word.

Available letters: We need to use letters that haven't been ruled out. Ruled out: C,A,N,O,B,S.

Common letters left: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z but avoid rare ones? Probably avoid Q, Z, X? Focus on common: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Also, we have two positions to consider: R must be in 3,4,5 and E in 1,2,3.

Now, we need to form a word that includes R and E and avoids the ruled-out letters.

Let me list possible positions:

Position 1: Could be? We have no information? But it cannot be R? (ruled by robes) and cannot be any of the x? So position 1 must be a new letter? Or E? Because E can be at position1? Similarly, position2: cannot be R? But what about E? Position2 could be E? Or other.

But we know from crane that position3 was A and it's absent? So position3 in secret word is not A? Similarly, position4 was N? absent? position5? E was absent? But position5 was E with '-' meaning E is in word but not at position5? So position5 could be any of the letters? But we also know E cannot be at position5? And position5 was tested again in robes? With E? But we put E at position4? So position5 in secret word hasn't been directly tested? It could be R? Or E? But E cannot be at position5? So position5 must be either R or a letter we haven't guessed? 

Wait: E cannot be at position5? Because crane feedback said E(-) at pos5? Then robes feedback said E(-) at pos4? So E must be elsewhere? Similarly, R cannot be at position1 or position2? 

So possible positions for:
- E: 1,2,3
- R: 3,4,5

We need to think of words that satisfy the constraints? 

Also, note: since R and E can both be at position3? That would be acceptable? For example, the word could have E at position3 and R at position3? No, one position? Unless repeated letters? But we don't know? We don't have evidence of repeated letters? So let's assume no repeats? Or allow? But possibly the word has distinct letters? 

We need to form a word? 

Common words: 

Set R at position3: then E can be at 1,2? (since at3 would conflict? Unless same letter? Not possible? So E at position1 or2? 

Similarly, set R at position4: then E at1,2,3? 

Or R at position5: then E at1,2,3? 

Now, try examples? 

For example, if R is at position3? Then we need E? at position1 or2? 

Possible word: LETTER? But we have double T? And T? But LETTER has 6 letters? No! 

Word must be 5 letter? 

Start E: Let E be at position1? 

Then word must contain R? and avoid C,A,N,O,B,S? 

Example: E _ _ _ R? Because if R at position5? Then E at1? Middle? 

But E must be? 

Possible word: ""ELDER""? 
- E(1) L D E(4) R(5)? Wait, repeated E? And E at position4? But we know E cannot be at position4? Because robes feedback said E(-) at position4? So position4 cannot be E? And we have E at position4? Not allowed? 

So ""ELDER"" has E at position4? Which is forbidden? Because we know from robes that the secret word does not have E at position4? 

Similarly, any word? 

Position4 cannot be E? As per feedback? So we need to avoid E at position4? 

Therefore, for the word: 
- E can only be at position1,2,3? 
- R at position3,4,5? 

Now, if we put R at position5? Then E at position1,2,or3? 

With any letters? 

Word: ""EXERT""? 
- E X E R T? But repeated E? And X? Not common? 

Avoid? 

Word: ""EARTH""? But A is absent? So skip.

Must avoid C,A,N,O,B,S? 

One possibility: ""MERRY""? 
- M E R R Y? 
- E at position2? 
- R at position3 and4? But we have R?
- Then R at position3 and4? 
- But position5 Y? 
But we are testing? And R is multiple? 

But feedback: We have R in the word? And position3? And4? But wait: 

In ""MERRY"": 
- Position1: M 
- Position2: E 
- Position3: R 
- Position4: R 
- Position5: Y 

If the secret word has only one R? Then one R would match? But we have two R? So feedback might show different? 

Perhaps avoid repeated letters for now? 

Another word: ""TIRED""?
- T I R E D
- Position1 T? 
- Position2 I? 
- Position3 R? 
- Position4 E? -> BUT we know that E cannot be at position4? Because we tested with robes? Position4 was E? And we got E(-)? Meaning E is in the word? But position4 is not E? So E cannot be at position4? 

Therefore, ""TIRED"" has E at position4? Which is forbidden? 

So we cannot use words with E at position4? 

Similarly, cannot R at position1 or position2? 

Possible words? 

Let me try to set E at position1? R at position5? Then middle letters? 

Word: ""EATER""? But A absent? Skip.

""EDGER""? D,G? But we have E at1? Position4? But we cannot have E at4? So skip? 

""EIDER""? Avoid? That bird? And has D? But E at1 and E at? ""EIDER"": E I D E R? Position4 is E? So again E at position4? Forbidden? 

How about ""EGRET""? Avoid? Has G? But E at1 and E at5? But E at5? But crane feedback said E(-) at position5? So E cannot be at position5? Also robes had S(x) at5? 

So ""EGRET"" has E at position5? Skip? 

Words with E at1 and R at5 and no E elsewhere? 

Example: ""ENTER""? Avoid? But N is absent? Crane: N(x)? N not in word? So break? 

""EVERY""? Avoid? V and Y? But it has E at1? And R at4? Then E at1? 
- E V E R Y? 
- Position4: R? 
- Position1: E? 
- Position2: V? 
- Position3: E? -> E at position3? Which is allowed? 
But avoid? Double E? And we have E at position3? 

But not position4? 

But note: we have only two E? But what about the feedback? 

If we guess ""EVERY"", we hope? 

But let's think: R is at position4? Which is allowed? 

We need to avoid O,B,S? Etc? 

But ""every"" is a word? 

Now, possible? 

But we also have Y at the end? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, consider E at position2? And R at position3? 

Word: ""LEPER""? L E P E R? Has double E? And E at2? E at4? But position4 is E? Forbidden? 

Bad? 

E at position2? R at position5? 

Word: ""METRO""? But O is absent? Skip.

""MERCY""? C absent? 

""TERRY""? T E R R Y? But R at3 and4? 

E at2? 

Avoid? 

Word: ""PERRY""? Avoid? P E R R Y? But E at position2? R at3,4? 

We have ruled out letters? 

Another idea: R at position3? E at position2? 

Word: ? Example: ""BERYL""? But B absent? And Y? 

""MERIT""? But O? Wait: M E R I T? 
- Position1: M? 
- Position2: E? 
- Position3: R? 
- Position4: I? 
- Position5: T? 
Avoids forbidden letters? 
- Letters in ""MERIT"": M,E,R,I,T? 
- Check absent letters: C? absent? A? absent? N? absent? O? absent? B? absent? S? absent? 
So no forbidden letters? 

Also:
- E at position2? Was not forbidden? 
- R at position3? Was not tested? 
- We avoid E at4 and E at5? 

So ""MERIT"" might be a good guess? 

Similarly, does it satisfy position constraints? 
- E could be at position2? 
- R at position3? 
- And E and R are present? 

Thus, I think ""MERIT"" is a good third guess? 

But we also need to test for possible R at position4 or5? 

In ""MERIT"", we have R at position3? So if R is at position3 in the secret word? Then we get feedback? 

If R is not at3? Then it will show '-' meaning R is in the word? But position4? Then we will know? Similarly? 

We also introduce M and I and T? 

I and T are common letters? 

So yes? 

We might guess ""MERIT"". 

Another possibility? R at position4? E at position3? 

Word: ""FIERY""? But F I E R Y? Then E at3? Position4 R? 
- Also I and F? And Y? 
But ""merit"" might be more common? 

""VERGE""? V E R G E? But E at position2 and position5? Position5 forbidden? Cannot have E at5? 

So skip? 

Therefore, I choose ""MERIT"". 

So guess: ""MERIT"". 

But let me be sure: 

Summary:
- Secret word must have R and E? and three other letters? 
- We ruled out: C, A, N, O, B, S? 
- ""MERIT"": uses M,E,R,I,T? 
- E at position2: acceptable? 
- R at position3? 
- If R is actually at position4? then we get '-' in R? and feedback will tell? 

It's good.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses, here's the key information:
- **Crane**: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-) → R and E are in the word, but R is not at position 2, and E is not at position 5. C, A, N are absent.
- **Robes**: R(-) O(x) B(x) E(-) S(x) → R is not at position 1, E is not at position 4. O, B, S are absent.
- **Letters confirmed in the word**: R, E.
- **Letters ruled out (absent)**: C, A, N, O, B, S.
- **R position constraints**: Cannot be at position 1 or 2, so must be at 3, 4, or 5.
- **E position constraints**: Cannot be at position 4 or 5, so must be at 1, 2, or 3.
- The secret word includes R and E, plus three other letters from the remaining pool: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y (avoiding rare letters like Q, X, Z).

For the third guess:
- We need to test possible positions for R and E while introducing new common letters.
- A good candidate is **""MERIT""**:
  - Positions E at 2 (untested, valid position) and R at 3 (untested, valid position).
  - Letters M, I, T are new and common.
  - Avoids ruled-out letters and forbidden E/R positions.

This guess maximizes information on E/R placement and tests three additional common letters.

<guess>merit</guess>",merit,"We have two guesses and feedback:
1. crane: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   - R and E are in the word, but R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.
   - C, A, N are not in the word.

2. robes: R(-) O(x) B(x) E(-) S(x)
   - R(-): R is in the word but not in position 1 (since guess had R at 1).
   - O(x): O is not in the word.
   - B(x): B is not in the word.
   - E(-): E is in the word but not in position 4 (since guess had E at 4).
   - S(x): S is not in the word.

Combined information:
- Letters in the word: R, E (from both guesses)
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, O, B, S (from x marks)
- R's position: Cannot be position 1 (from robes feedback) or position 2 (from crane feedback). So R must be in position 3 or 4 (since position 5 is possible? Wait, positions are 1-5. We've ruled out 1 and 2, so R in 3,4, or possibly 5? But note: crane had R at position 2, which was wrong, but we didn't rule out position 5 for R? We need to consider all positions).

Specifically for R:
- From crane: R is in the word, not at pos2.
- From robes: R is in the word, not at pos1.
So R must be at position 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly for E:
- From crane: E is in the word, not at pos5.
- From robes: E is in the word, not at pos4.
So E must be at position 1, 2, or 3.

Also, note that the secret word has only the letters we know (R and E) plus three other letters that must be among the remaining unused letters? And we have ruled out: C, A, N, O, B, S. So these are not in the word.

Available letters: We need to use letters that haven't been ruled out. Ruled out: C,A,N,O,B,S.

Common letters left: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z but avoid rare ones? Probably avoid Q, Z, X? Focus on common: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Also, we have two positions to consider: R must be in 3,4,5 and E in 1,2,3.

Now, we need to form a word that includes R and E and avoids the ruled-out letters.

Let me list possible positions:

Position 1: Could be? We have no information? But it cannot be R? (ruled by robes) and cannot be any of the x? So position 1 must be a new letter? Or E? Because E can be at position1? Similarly, position2: cannot be R? But what about E? Position2 could be E? Or other.

But we know from crane that position3 was A and it's absent? So position3 in secret word is not A? Similarly, position4 was N? absent? position5? E was absent? But position5 was E with '-' meaning E is in word but not at position5? So position5 could be any of the letters? But we also know E cannot be at position5? And position5 was tested again in robes? With E? But we put E at position4? So position5 in secret word hasn't been directly tested? It could be R? Or E? But E cannot be at position5? So position5 must be either R or a letter we haven't guessed? 

Wait: E cannot be at position5? Because crane feedback said E(-) at pos5? Then robes feedback said E(-) at pos4? So E must be elsewhere? Similarly, R cannot be at position1 or position2? 

So possible positions for:
- E: 1,2,3
- R: 3,4,5

We need to think of words that satisfy the constraints? 

Also, note: since R and E can both be at position3? That would be acceptable? For example, the word could have E at position3 and R at position3? No, one position? Unless repeated letters? But we don't know? We don't have evidence of repeated letters? So let's assume no repeats? Or allow? But possibly the word has distinct letters? 

We need to form a word? 

Common words: 

Set R at position3: then E can be at 1,2? (since at3 would conflict? Unless same letter? Not possible? So E at position1 or2? 

Similarly, set R at position4: then E at1,2,3? 

Or R at position5: then E at1,2,3? 

Now, try examples? 

For example, if R is at position3? Then we need E? at position1 or2? 

Possible word: LETTER? But we have double T? And T? But LETTER has 6 letters? No! 

Word must be 5 letter? 

Start E: Let E be at position1? 

Then word must contain R? and avoid C,A,N,O,B,S? 

Example: E _ _ _ R? Because if R at position5? Then E at1? Middle? 

But E must be? 

Possible word: ""ELDER""? 
- E(1) L D E(4) R(5)? Wait, repeated E? And E at position4? But we know E cannot be at position4? Because robes feedback said E(-) at position4? So position4 cannot be E? And we have E at position4? Not allowed? 

So ""ELDER"" has E at position4? Which is forbidden? Because we know from robes that the secret word does not have E at position4? 

Similarly, any word? 

Position4 cannot be E? As per feedback? So we need to avoid E at position4? 

Therefore, for the word: 
- E can only be at position1,2,3? 
- R at position3,4,5? 

Now, if we put R at position5? Then E at position1,2,or3? 

With any letters? 

Word: ""EXERT""? 
- E X E R T? But repeated E? And X? Not common? 

Avoid? 

Word: ""EARTH""? But A is absent? So skip.

Must avoid C,A,N,O,B,S? 

One possibility: ""MERRY""? 
- M E R R Y? 
- E at position2? 
- R at position3 and4? But we have R?
- Then R at position3 and4? 
- But position5 Y? 
But we are testing? And R is multiple? 

But feedback: We have R in the word? And position3? And4? But wait: 

In ""MERRY"": 
- Position1: M 
- Position2: E 
- Position3: R 
- Position4: R 
- Position5: Y 

If the secret word has only one R? Then one R would match? But we have two R? So feedback might show different? 

Perhaps avoid repeated letters for now? 

Another word: ""TIRED""?
- T I R E D
- Position1 T? 
- Position2 I? 
- Position3 R? 
- Position4 E? -> BUT we know that E cannot be at position4? Because we tested with robes? Position4 was E? And we got E(-)? Meaning E is in the word? But position4 is not E? So E cannot be at position4? 

Therefore, ""TIRED"" has E at position4? Which is forbidden? 

So we cannot use words with E at position4? 

Similarly, cannot R at position1 or position2? 

Possible words? 

Let me try to set E at position1? R at position5? Then middle letters? 

Word: ""EATER""? But A absent? Skip.

""EDGER""? D,G? But we have E at1? Position4? But we cannot have E at4? So skip? 

""EIDER""? Avoid? That bird? And has D? But E at1 and E at? ""EIDER"": E I D E R? Position4 is E? So again E at position4? Forbidden? 

How about ""EGRET""? Avoid? Has G? But E at1 and E at5? But E at5? But crane feedback said E(-) at position5? So E cannot be at position5? Also robes had S(x) at5? 

So ""EGRET"" has E at position5? Skip? 

Words with E at1 and R at5 and no E elsewhere? 

Example: ""ENTER""? Avoid? But N is absent? Crane: N(x)? N not in word? So break? 

""EVERY""? Avoid? V and Y? But it has E at1? And R at4? Then E at1? 
- E V E R Y? 
- Position4: R? 
- Position1: E? 
- Position2: V? 
- Position3: E? -> E at position3? Which is allowed? 
But avoid? Double E? And we have E at position3? 

But not position4? 

But note: we have only two E? But what about the feedback? 

If we guess ""EVERY"", we hope? 

But let's think: R is at position4? Which is allowed? 

We need to avoid O,B,S? Etc? 

But ""every"" is a word? 

Now, possible? 

But we also have Y at the end? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, consider E at position2? And R at position3? 

Word: ""LEPER""? L E P E R? Has double E? And E at2? E at4? But position4 is E? Forbidden? 

Bad? 

E at position2? R at position5? 

Word: ""METRO""? But O is absent? Skip.

""MERCY""? C absent? 

""TERRY""? T E R R Y? But R at3 and4? 

E at2? 

Avoid? 

Word: ""PERRY""? Avoid? P E R R Y? But E at position2? R at3,4? 

We have ruled out letters? 

Another idea: R at position3? E at position2? 

Word: ? Example: ""BERYL""? But B absent? And Y? 

""MERIT""? But O? Wait: M E R I T? 
- Position1: M? 
- Position2: E? 
- Position3: R? 
- Position4: I? 
- Position5: T? 
Avoids forbidden letters? 
- Letters in ""MERIT"": M,E,R,I,T? 
- Check absent letters: C? absent? A? absent? N? absent? O? absent? B? absent? S? absent? 
So no forbidden letters? 

Also:
- E at position2? Was not forbidden? 
- R at position3? Was not tested? 
- We avoid E at4 and E at5? 

So ""MERIT"" might be a good guess? 

Similarly, does it satisfy position constraints? 
- E could be at position2? 
- R at position3? 
- And E and R are present? 

Thus, I think ""MERIT"" is a good third guess? 

But we also need to test for possible R at position4 or5? 

In ""MERIT"", we have R at position3? So if R is at position3 in the secret word? Then we get feedback? 

If R is not at3? Then it will show '-' meaning R is in the word? But position4? Then we will know? Similarly? 

We also introduce M and I and T? 

I and T are common letters? 

So yes? 

We might guess ""MERIT"". 

Another possibility? R at position4? E at position3? 

Word: ""FIERY""? But F I E R Y? Then E at3? Position4 R? 
- Also I and F? And Y? 
But ""merit"" might be more common? 

""VERGE""? V E R G E? But E at position2 and position5? Position5 forbidden? Cannot have E at5? 

So skip? 

Therefore, I choose ""MERIT"". 

So guess: ""MERIT"". 

But let me be sure: 

Summary:
- Secret word must have R and E? and three other letters? 
- We ruled out: C, A, N, O, B, S? 
- ""MERIT"": uses M,E,R,I,T? 
- E at position2: acceptable? 
- R at position3? 
- If R is actually at position4? then we get '-' in R? and feedback will tell? 

It's good.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses, here's the key information:
- **Crane**: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-) → R and E are in the word, but R is not at position 2, and E is not at position 5. C, A, N are absent.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,LEERY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So we know:
- The secret word contains the letters 'R' and 'E', but not in the positions they were guessed (position 2 and 5 respectively).
- The letters 'C', 'A', 'N' are not in the word.

We must avoid using C, A, N in the next guess.

The word has 5 letters, and we know it has R and E, but we don't know their exact positions.

Let me think of a good second word that includes R and E (but not in position 2 for R, and not in position 5 for E) and avoids C, A, N.

Also, we want to cover new common letters to get more information.

Common consonants we haven't tried: S, T, L, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, etc.
Vowels: We have E, so we might want to try other vowels: O, U, I (but note we avoided A).

But note: 'R' is in the word, but not in position 2. So R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? Wait, position 5 was E with '-', meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. Similarly, R is not in position 2.

Let me denote positions: 1: C (x), 2: R (-), 3: A (x), 4: N (x), 5: E (-)

So:
- R must be in one of positions 1, 3, 4, but note:
  - Position 1: We had C (x) -> so R could be at position 1? Actually, position 1 was C, so R wasn't there? Wait, no: the feedback for R is '-', meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in position 1? But wait, position 1 is occupied by C, so if R was in position 1, it would have been marked as 'x' because we guessed a wrong letter? The feedback is per letter: the secret word doesn't have C in position 1? Actually, we know that the secret word might have R in position 1? Let me clarify.

Actually, the feedback symbol applies to each letter independently. For the first position, we guessed C and it was 'x', meaning the letter at that position is not C. The secret word could have any letter at that position - including R? Since we don't have any other information about position 1? Actually, if the secret word had R at position 1, then when we guessed C at 1 (which is wrong) and R at 2 (which is present elsewhere), then R at position 1 wouldn't be revealed because we didn't guess R in position 1. We only guessed R in position 2, so that R (at position 2) was compared to the secret word. Therefore, the secret word does have R, just not in position 2.

Similarly, E is in the word but not in position 5.

So possible positions for R: 1, 3, or 4 (but note position 3 and 4 we had A and N which are both absent, so R could be in 1, 3, or 4).

Wait, in positions 3 and 4 in the secret word? In the guess, position 3 was A and 4 was N, both 'x', meaning the secret word does not have A or N at any position? So, the secret word might have R in position 3? But then, since we guessed N at position 4, and it was missing, R could be in position 4? Or in position 1? And we guessed E at position 5 and it's present elsewhere.

So we need a word that:
- Includes R and E (both are present)
- Does not contain C, A, N
- And try to put R and E in new positions (not position 2 for R, not position 5 for E).

Let me list possible letters: We have used: C, R, A, N, E. Avoid C, A, N.

Common letters remaining: S, T, L, O, I, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, U, etc.

A good candidate word might be ""TRIES"" or ""ROGUE""? But we have to avoid A and N.

Let me think: we want to test R in a different position. Since position 2 was wrong, let's try putting R at position 1? Or position 3? But note: position 1 we don't know, so trying R at position 1 might be good? However, we also know E is present, but not at position 5.

Alternatively, we could try E in a different position (not 5).

Also, we want to cover new consonants and vowels.

The word ""STORE"" comes to mind: 
- S: new consonant
- T: new consonant
- O: new vowel
- R: we know it's in the word, put it in position 4? That's a new position (was position 2 in first guess). 
- E: we know it's in the word, put it at the end? But wait, in the first guess E was at position 5 and got '-', meaning E is not at position 5? So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again? Unless we are testing if there is another E? But let's avoid position 5 for E.

So if I put E in position 5 again, and if it is still '-' (meaning not at 5) that doesn't give new information. We already know E isn't at 5. So we should try E in a different position? Unless we suspect E is at 5? But the feedback says no.

So we must avoid E at position 5.

Therefore, ""STORE"" has E at position 5: bad.

Alternative: ""STERN"": 
- Positions: S (1), T (2), E (3), R (4), N (5). But wait, we were told that N is not in the word? Oh, no: we guessed N and it was 'x', so N is not in the word. So ""STERN"" has N -> we must avoid.

Another word: ""CREST""? But we also have C? We must avoid C. Guess had C and it was 'x', so C is out.

""TRIED"": 
- T, R, I, E, D -> contains R and E. R is in position 2? But in the first guess R was in position 2 and it was '-', meaning that position 2 is not R? So if I put R at position 2 again, and if the secret word has R somewhere else, it would still show '-'? Actually, if the secret word has R in position 2, then it would show '✓'. But since we know from first feedback that at position 2 it's not R, so if I guess R at position 2 again and if I get '-' again, that doesn't tell me anything new? So it's better to try R in a different position to see if it fits elsewhere.

So let me avoid position 2 for R? And we also avoid position 5 for E.

In ""TRIED"":
- T at 1
- R at 2 -> bad because same position as first guess? We don't want to repeat R at position 2 because we know it's not there? Actually, if I put R at 2 again and get '-' again, that doesn't give new information. Better to try R at a new position.

But wait: in ""TRIED"", E is at position 4? And D at the end.

Another word: ""GRIEF"": 
- G, R, I, E, F -> R is at position 2? Same issue.

How about ""MERRY""? But we don't want multiple R necessarily? The word could have repeating letters? But let's avoid for now? Also, we need 5 distinct? No, can have repeats.

But in this case, we are putting R at positions 2 and 3? And E at 4? That might be messy.

Better to try R at position 1. For example, ""ROUSE"":
- R at 1 (which wasn't guessed before? Actually, we guessed C at 1 so we don't know about R at 1)
- O at 2: new
- U at 3: new
- S at 4: new
- E at 5: but we must avoid E at 5? Because first guess said E is not at 5? So if we try E at 5 again, and it shows '-' that tells us E is still not at 5? But we already know E is not at 5? So no new information? Worse, if we put E at 5 and it becomes '✓', that would be new? But the first feedback said '-' for E at 5 meaning that the secret word has E but not at position 5? So E cannot be at position 5? Therefore, putting E at 5 again will definitely be '-', so we avoid? We should use E in a different position.

So let's avoid position 5 for E? We can put E at 1, 2, 3, 4? But note E wasn't tried elsewhere.

Word: ""RESET"": 
- R(1) E(2) S(3) E(4) T(5) -> but we have two E? Also, we put R at 1 and E at 2? But we don't know if E can be at 2? And we avoid E at 5? Wait T at 5 is new? But we have E also at 4? We are testing multiple E? But we don't know if we have one or two E? Since the first guess had E at 5 and got '-' meaning one E? Actually, '-' indicates that letter is present but in wrong position? It doesn't say how many? So there could be multiple E? However, we only got one '-' for E? That doesn't prevent another E? But possibly minimal? Let's stick to words without repeats?

But ""RESET"" has two E? Also, we have S and T which are new.

Alternatively, how about ""RISEN""? But we avoid N? So can't use N.

What about ""BRIEF"":
- B at 1
- R at 2 -> same position as first guess? We know R not at 2? So move?
- B at 1, R at 2 -> problem with R at 2.

We need a word where R is not at 2 and E is not at 5? And contains only letters that haven't been ruled out? Ruled out: C, A, N.

So: ""PRIZE""? But Z is uncommon? Also, we don't want Q, Z, X? Better common letters.

""TRIER"" ? R at 4? And E at 3? But T at 1? But ""TRIER"" has repeated R? Doesn't matter? But let me think.

Perhaps: ""ROUND""? But we avoid N? So skip.

""HEART""? But we avoid A? Because feedback said A is absent? And T? H? But ""HEART"": H E A R T -> A is absent? So skip.

Another idea: ""DOZER""? Avoid Z? And O?

Better: ""STELE""? Uncommon? Or ""TRICE"" -> avoid C.

Let me try to form a word: 
Let's put R at the beginning: R at position 1.
E at position 4? Then we need letters not ruled out? So positions: 1: R, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: E, 5: ?

Letters we haven't guessed: For position 2, we can use B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, etc.

For example: ""RULER"": 
- R at 1: good position? we don't know yet? 
- U at 2: new vowel?
- L at 3: new consonant?
- E at 4: new position? 
- R at 5: but R might be repeated? 

But ""RULER"" has two R: but we don't know if the word has repeated letters? However, we know R is present? If we don't get two R in the feedback, we'll know? So it's acceptable? Also avoids C,A,N.

But E is at position 4? Which is different from the previous guess at 5? So that's good.

Alternatively: ""RODEO"" avoid? It has only 5? But O repeated? And E? ""R O D E O"" -> the word must be English? And ""rodeo"" is a English word? But we don't know?

But let's consider more common words.

Another idea: ""PROBE""? P,R,O,B,E -> 
- R at position 2? Ah, same position as first guess? We should avoid R at position2? Because we know it's not R? So let's move R: position 2 is bad? Then put R at 1? Or 3? 

So ""PERIL"" might work? 
- P at 1, E at 2, R at 3? But R at 3: hasn't been guessed at that position? And E at 2: hasn't been guessed? 
- Positions: 1: P? 2: E? 3: R? 4: I? 5: L?

So we would be testing E at position 2? We don't know if it's there? And avoiding E at 5? Also, we have R at position 3? So not position2? Good? But wait: if E is at 2, it might be ok? But we don't have any information about position2 except it's not R? It could be E? Or not?

So ""PERIL"" might be a good choice? 

Or ""SERUM"": 
- S at 1, E at 2, R at 3? Same as above? Then U at4, M at5.

But same pattern? Let's choose ""PERIL""? Or ""METRO"": 
- M at1, E at2, T at3, R at4, O at5 -> but E is at2? And R at4.

But we avoid putting E at5? So that's fine? We have E at2? Which wasn't used?

However, note we don't have any feedback about position2? Only that it wasn't R? But we don't know if it is E? Or any other letter.

Another word: ""TREES""? Too many E? Avoid?

I think ""PERIL"" is a good choice? 

But let's see: we have R and E in new positions? Yes? 
- First guess: R at pos2? Now R at pos3? E was at pos5? Now E at pos2? 

Letters to cover: P, E, R, I, L? But I and L are vowels? Consonants? 

P is new, E we know is present? R we know is present? I is vowel? L is consonant? We haven tested P,I,L.

Alternatively, how about ""BLIER""? Uncommon? Or ""CRIER""? Avoid C.

""DRIVE"": D R at pos2? Avoid R at pos2? So no? Because we put R at pos2? We shouldn't put R at pos2? Because we know pos2 is not R? So we avoid pos2? Therefore, ""DRIVE"" has R at pos2? Discard.

So ""PERIL"" seems acceptable? Or ""MOVER"": M O V E R? V? And E at position4? And R at5? 

But V? Could be? 

But let me choose a word that has common letters? 

I think ""STEEL""? But double E? And E at position5? Avoid position5 for E? 

So I decide on ""PERIL"". 

But note: we guessed ""crane"": 
- R is present? But now we put R at position3? 
- E is present? But we put E at position2? 

It might be? 

Alternatively, ""STREW"": 
- S T R E W -> 
- Position2 is T? 
- Position3 is R? 
- Position4 is E? 
- Avoid position5 for E? Put E at4? 
- So: 1: S, 2: T, 3: R, 4: E, 5: W? Word ""strew""? 

But R is at position3? And E at position4? 

This avoids position2 for R and position5 for E? Also tested new letters: S, T, W? 

Also avoids C,A,N? 

I think that's a good candidate? 

Another option: ""BORED"" -> B O R E D? R at position3? E at position4? And avoid E at5? 
- Positions: B(1), O(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). Also avoids redundant position for R? 

Commonality? ""strew"" might be less common? 

Or ""GIVEN""? Avoid N? Cannot.

I think ""BORED"" is a good word? But does it have all common letters? 

Also ""TOGUE""? Uncommon? 

Let me go with ""BORED""? 

But we have O? Which is vowel? 

Another word: ""QUERY""? Q might be rare? 

So ""BORED"" sounds common? 

But let me look: 
- We know from feedback that the secret word has R and E? So if we put R and E in positions 3 and 4? But we haven't tested the positions? 

I think ""BORED"" is a reasonable second guess? 

But wait: could R be at position1? We haven't tested position1? So perhaps we should try R at position1? 

Similarly, E might be at position1? 

But we have B? Or T? etc. 

Let's choose a word with R at position1? For example, ""RADII""? Avoid A? Cannot. 

""ROBES"": 
- R O B E S? 
- R at1? 
- O at2? 
- B at3? 
- E at4? 
- S at5? 
Avoids E at5? 
Also avoids A,N? 

So ""ROBES""?

But O at2? We don't know? And E at4? 

This way we test R at position1? 

But we already know R is present? So if R is at position1 and we guess it, it will be '✓'? Or if not, '-' meaning it's elsewhere? 

We want to know the position? So testing R at position1 might be good? 

Similarly, E at4? 

Plus, letters O,B,S? 

I think ""ROBES"" is a good second guess? 

I'll go with that? 

But note: we haven't used S? And it's common? 

I think ""ROBES"" is a valid and reasonable guess? 

Therefore, my second guess is ""robes"". 

Wait, but let me confirm: 
- First guess: ""crane"" -> feedback C(x), R(-) meaning R is present but not at pos2? 
- Second guess: ""robes"" has R at position1? So if the secret word has R at position1, we get '✓' for that? If not, we get '-'? 

Also E at position4? If E is at position4, we get '✓'? Or if not? Since E is present but how? 

So it's a good test.

Thus, I choose ""ROBES"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)), we know:
- The secret word contains R and E, but R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5.
- The letters C, A, and N are absent from the word.
- R must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (positions not confirmed or tested properly yet).
- E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is incorrect).

For the second guess, we should:
1. Include R and E to verify their positions.
2. Avoid C, A, N entirely.
3. Use common letters to maximize information gain.
4. Preferably place R and E in new, untested positions (e.g., R not at position 2, E not at position 5).
5. Cover additional high-frequency letters like B, O, S, etc.

A suitable word is **""ROBES""**:
- R at position 1: Tests if R is in the first position (if correct ✓, or wrong ─ but we already know R is present).
- O at position 2: New vowel and position we have no information about.
- B at position 3: New consonant, tests another common letter.
- E at position 4: New position for E (not position 5).
- S at position 5: New consonant and position.

This guess efficiently checks potential positions for R and E while introducing three new letters (O, B, S) to gain more feedback.

<guess>robes</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: robes -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) B(x) E(-) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and feedback:
1. crane: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   - R and E are in the word, but R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.
   - C, A, N are not in the word.

2. robes: R(-) O(x) B(x) E(-) S(x)
   - R(-): R is in the word but not in position 1 (since guess had R at 1).
   - O(x): O is not in the word.
   - B(x): B is not in the word.
   - E(-): E is in the word but not in position 4 (since guess had E at 4).
   - S(x): S is not in the word.

Combined information:
- Letters in the word: R, E (from both guesses)
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, O, B, S (from x marks)
- R's position: Cannot be position 1 (from robes feedback) or position 2 (from crane feedback). So R must be in position 3 or 4 (since position 5 is possible? Wait, positions are 1-5. We've ruled out 1 and 2, so R in 3,4, or possibly 5? But note: crane had R at position 2, which was wrong, but we didn't rule out position 5 for R? We need to consider all positions).

Specifically for R:
- From crane: R is in the word, not at pos2.
- From robes: R is in the word, not at pos1.
So R must be at position 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly for E:
- From crane: E is in the word, not at pos5.
- From robes: E is in the word, not at pos4.
So E must be at position 1, 2, or 3.

Also, note that the secret word has only the letters we know (R and E) plus three other letters that must be among the remaining unused letters? And we have ruled out: C, A, N, O, B, S. So these are not in the word.

Available letters: We need to use letters that haven't been ruled out. Ruled out: C,A,N,O,B,S.

Common letters left: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z but avoid rare ones? Probably avoid Q, Z, X? Focus on common: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Also, we have two positions to consider: R must be in 3,4,5 and E in 1,2,3.

Now, we need to form a word that includes R and E and avoids the ruled-out letters.

Let me list possible positions:

Position 1: Could be? We have no information? But it cannot be R? (ruled by robes) and cannot be any of the x? So position 1 must be a new letter? Or E? Because E can be at position1? Similarly, position2: cannot be R? But what about E? Position2 could be E? Or other.

But we know from crane that position3 was A and it's absent? So position3 in secret word is not A? Similarly, position4 was N? absent? position5? E was absent? But position5 was E with '-' meaning E is in word but not at position5? So position5 could be any of the letters? But we also know E cannot be at position5? And position5 was tested again in robes? With E? But we put E at position4? So position5 in secret word hasn't been directly tested? It could be R? Or E? But E cannot be at position5? So position5 must be either R or a letter we haven't guessed? 

Wait: E cannot be at position5? Because crane feedback said E(-) at pos5? Then robes feedback said E(-) at pos4? So E must be elsewhere? Similarly, R cannot be at position1 or position2? 

So possible positions for:
- E: 1,2,3
- R: 3,4,5

We need to think of words that satisfy the constraints? 

Also, note: since R and E can both be at position3? That would be acceptable? For example, the word could have E at position3 and R at position3? No, one position? Unless repeated letters? But we don't know? We don't have evidence of repeated letters? So let's assume no repeats? Or allow? But possibly the word has distinct letters? 

We need to form a word? 

Common words: 

Set R at position3: then E can be at 1,2? (since at3 would conflict? Unless same letter? Not possible? So E at position1 or2? 

Similarly, set R at position4: then E at1,2,3? 

Or R at position5: then E at1,2,3? 

Now, try examples? 

For example, if R is at position3? Then we need E? at position1 or2? 

Possible word: LETTER? But we have double T? And T? But LETTER has 6 letters? No! 

Word must be 5 letter? 

Start E: Let E be at position1? 

Then word must contain R? and avoid C,A,N,O,B,S? 

Example: E _ _ _ R? Because if R at position5? Then E at1? Middle? 

But E must be? 

Possible word: ""ELDER""? 
- E(1) L D E(4) R(5)? Wait, repeated E? And E at position4? But we know E cannot be at position4? Because robes feedback said E(-) at position4? So position4 cannot be E? And we have E at position4? Not allowed? 

So ""ELDER"" has E at position4? Which is forbidden? Because we know from robes that the secret word does not have E at position4? 

Similarly, any word? 

Position4 cannot be E? As per feedback? So we need to avoid E at position4? 

Therefore, for the word: 
- E can only be at position1,2,3? 
- R at position3,4,5? 

Now, if we put R at position5? Then E at position1,2,or3? 

With any letters? 

Word: ""EXERT""? 
- E X E R T? But repeated E? And X? Not common? 

Avoid? 

Word: ""EARTH""? But A is absent? So skip.

Must avoid C,A,N,O,B,S? 

One possibility: ""MERRY""? 
- M E R R Y? 
- E at position2? 
- R at position3 and4? But we have R?
- Then R at position3 and4? 
- But position5 Y? 
But we are testing? And R is multiple? 

But feedback: We have R in the word? And position3? And4? But wait: 

In ""MERRY"": 
- Position1: M 
- Position2: E 
- Position3: R 
- Position4: R 
- Position5: Y 

If the secret word has only one R? Then one R would match? But we have two R? So feedback might show different? 

Perhaps avoid repeated letters for now? 

Another word: ""TIRED""?
- T I R E D
- Position1 T? 
- Position2 I? 
- Position3 R? 
- Position4 E? -> BUT we know that E cannot be at position4? Because we tested with robes? Position4 was E? And we got E(-)? Meaning E is in the word? But position4 is not E? So E cannot be at position4? 

Therefore, ""TIRED"" has E at position4? Which is forbidden? 

So we cannot use words with E at position4? 

Similarly, cannot R at position1 or position2? 

Possible words? 

Let me try to set E at position1? R at position5? Then middle letters? 

Word: ""EATER""? But A absent? Skip.

""EDGER""? D,G? But we have E at1? Position4? But we cannot have E at4? So skip? 

""EIDER""? Avoid? That bird? And has D? But E at1 and E at? ""EIDER"": E I D E R? Position4 is E? So again E at position4? Forbidden? 

How about ""EGRET""? Avoid? Has G? But E at1 and E at5? But E at5? But crane feedback said E(-) at position5? So E cannot be at position5? Also robes had S(x) at5? 

So ""EGRET"" has E at position5? Skip? 

Words with E at1 and R at5 and no E elsewhere? 

Example: ""ENTER""? Avoid? But N is absent? Crane: N(x)? N not in word? So break? 

""EVERY""? Avoid? V and Y? But it has E at1? And R at4? Then E at1? 
- E V E R Y? 
- Position4: R? 
- Position1: E? 
- Position2: V? 
- Position3: E? -> E at position3? Which is allowed? 
But avoid? Double E? And we have E at position3? 

But not position4? 

But note: we have only two E? But what about the feedback? 

If we guess ""EVERY"", we hope? 

But let's think: R is at position4? Which is allowed? 

We need to avoid O,B,S? Etc? 

But ""every"" is a word? 

Now, possible? 

But we also have Y at the end? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, consider E at position2? And R at position3? 

Word: ""LEPER""? L E P E R? Has double E? And E at2? E at4? But position4 is E? Forbidden? 

Bad? 

E at position2? R at position5? 

Word: ""METRO""? But O is absent? Skip.

""MERCY""? C absent? 

""TERRY""? T E R R Y? But R at3 and4? 

E at2? 

Avoid? 

Word: ""PERRY""? Avoid? P E R R Y? But E at position2? R at3,4? 

We have ruled out letters? 

Another idea: R at position3? E at position2? 

Word: ? Example: ""BERYL""? But B absent? And Y? 

""MERIT""? But O? Wait: M E R I T? 
- Position1: M? 
- Position2: E? 
- Position3: R? 
- Position4: I? 
- Position5: T? 
Avoids forbidden letters? 
- Letters in ""MERIT"": M,E,R,I,T? 
- Check absent letters: C? absent? A? absent? N? absent? O? absent? B? absent? S? absent? 
So no forbidden letters? 

Also:
- E at position2? Was not forbidden? 
- R at position3? Was not tested? 
- We avoid E at4 and E at5? 

So ""MERIT"" might be a good guess? 

Similarly, does it satisfy position constraints? 
- E could be at position2? 
- R at position3? 
- And E and R are present? 

Thus, I think ""MERIT"" is a good third guess? 

But we also need to test for possible R at position4 or5? 

In ""MERIT"", we have R at position3? So if R is at position3 in the secret word? Then we get feedback? 

If R is not at3? Then it will show '-' meaning R is in the word? But position4? Then we will know? Similarly? 

We also introduce M and I and T? 

I and T are common letters? 

So yes? 

We might guess ""MERIT"". 

Another possibility? R at position4? E at position3? 

Word: ""FIERY""? But F I E R Y? Then E at3? Position4 R? 
- Also I and F? And Y? 
But ""merit"" might be more common? 

""VERGE""? V E R G E? But E at position2 and position5? Position5 forbidden? Cannot have E at5? 

So skip? 

Therefore, I choose ""MERIT"". 

So guess: ""MERIT"". 

But let me be sure: 

Summary:
- Secret word must have R and E? and three other letters? 
- We ruled out: C, A, N, O, B, S? 
- ""MERIT"": uses M,E,R,I,T? 
- E at position2: acceptable? 
- R at position3? 
- If R is actually at position4? then we get '-' in R? and feedback will tell? 

It's good.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses, here's the key information:
- **Crane**: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-) → R and E are in the word, but R is not at position 2, and E is not at position 5. C, A, N are absent.
- **Robes**: R(-) O(x) B(x) E(-) S(x) → R is not at position 1, E is not at position 4. O, B, S are absent.
- **Letters confirmed in the word**: R, E.
- **Letters ruled out (absent)**: C, A, N, O, B, S.
- **R position constraints**: Cannot be at position 1 or 2, so must be at 3, 4, or 5.
- **E position constraints**: Cannot be at position 4 or 5, so must be at 1, 2, or 3.
- The secret word includes R and E, plus three other letters from the remaining pool: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y (avoiding rare letters like Q, X, Z).

For the third guess:
- We need to test possible positions for R and E while introducing new common letters.
- A good candidate is **""MERIT""**:
  - Positions E at 2 (untested, valid position) and R at 3 (untested, valid position).
  - Letters M, I, T are new and common.
  - Avoids ruled-out letters and forbidden E/R positions.

This guess maximizes information on E/R placement and tests three additional common letters.

So R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? Wait, position 5 was E with \'-\', meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. Similarly, R is not in position 2.\n\nLet me denote positions: 1: C (x), 2: R (-), 3: A (x), 4: N (x), 5: E (-)\n\nSo:\n- R must be in one of positions 1, 3, 4, but note:\n  - Position 1: We had C (x) -> so R could be at position 1? Actually, position 1 was C, so R wasn\'t there? Wait, no: the feedback for R is \'-\', meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in position 1? But wait, position 1 is occupied by C, so if R was in position 1, it would have been marked as \'x\' because we guessed a wrong letter? The feedback is per letter: the secret word doesn\'t have C in position 1? Actually, we know that the secret word might have R in position 1? Let me clarify.\n\nActually, the feedback symbol applies to each letter independently. For the first position, we guessed C and it was \'x\', meaning the letter at that position is not C. The secret word could have any letter at that position - including R? Since we don\'t have any other information about position 1? Actually, if the secret word had R at position 1, then when we guessed C at 1 (which is wrong) and R at 2 (which is present elsewhere), then R at position 1 wouldn\'t be revealed because we didn\'t guess R in position 1. We only guessed R in position 2, so that R (at position 2) was compared to the secret word. Therefore, the secret word does have R, just not in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nSo possible positions for R: 1, 3, or 4 (but note position 3 and 4 we had A and N which are both absent, so R could be in 1, 3, or 4).\n\nWait, in positions 3 and 4 in the secret word? In the guess, position 3 was A and 4 was N, both \'x\', meaning the secret word does not have A or N at any position? So, the secret word might have R in position 3? But then, since we guessed N at position 4, and it was missing, R could be in position 4? Or in position 1? And we guessed E at position 5 and it\'s present elsewhere.\n\nSo we need a word that:\n- Includes R and E (both are present)\n- Does not contain C, A, N\n- And try to put R and E in new positions (not position 2 for R, not position 5 for E).\n\nLet me list possible letters: We have used: C, R, A, N, E. Avoid C, A, N.\n\nCommon letters remaining: S, T, L, O, I, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, U, etc.\n\nA good candidate word might be ""TRIES"" or ""ROGUE""? But we have to avoid A and N.\n\nLet me think: we want to test R in a different position. Since position 2 was wrong, let\'s try putting R at position 1? Or position 3? But note: position 1 we don\'t know, so trying R at position 1 might be good? However, we also know E is present, but not at position 5.\n\nAlternatively, we could try E in a different position (not 5).\n\nAlso, we want to cover new consonants and vowels.\n\nThe word ""STORE"" comes to mind: \n- S: new consonant\n- T: new consonant\n- O: new vowel\n- R: we know it\'s in the word, put it in position 4? That\'s a new position (was position 2 in first guess). \n- E: we know it\'s in the word, put it at the end? But wait, in the first guess E was at position 5 and got \'-\', meaning E is not at position 5? So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again? Unless we are testing if there is another E? But let\'s avoid position 5 for E.\n\nSo if I put E in position 5 again, and if it is still \'-\' (meaning not at 5) that doesn\'t give new information. We already know E isn\'t at 5. So we should try E in a different position? Unless we suspect E is at 5? But the feedback says no.\n\nSo we must avoid E at position 5.\n\nTherefore, ""STORE"" has E at position 5: bad.\n\nAlternative: ""STERN"": \n- Positions: S (1), T (2), E (3), R (4), N (5). But wait, we were told that N is not in the word? Oh, no: we guessed N and it was \'x\', so N is not in the word. So ""STERN"" has N -> we must avoid.\n\nAnother word: ""CREST""? But we also have C? We must avoid C. Guess had C and it was \'x\', so C is out.\n\n""TRIED"": \n- T, R, I, E, D -> contains R and E. R is in position 2? But in the first guess R was in position 2 and it was \'-\', meaning that position 2 is not R? So if I put R at position 2 again, and if the secret word has R somewhere else, it would still show \'-\'? Actually, if the secret word has R in position 2, then it would show \'✓\'. But since we know from first feedback that at position 2 it\'s not R, so if I guess R at position 2 again and if I get \'-\' again, that doesn\'t tell me anything new? So it\'s better to try R in a different position to see if it fits elsewhere.\n\nSo let me avoid position 2 for R? And we also avoid position 5 for E.\n\nIn ""TRIED"":\n- T at 1\n- R at 2 -> bad because same position as first guess? We don\'t want to repeat R at position 2 because we know it\'s not there? Actually, if I put R at 2 again and get \'-\' again, that doesn\'t give new information. Better to try R at a new position.\n\nBut wait: in ""TRIED"", E is at position 4? And D at the end.\n\nAnother word: ""GRIEF"": \n- G, R, I, E, F -> R is at position 2? Same issue.\n\nHow about ""MERRY""? But we don\'t want multiple R necessarily? The word could have repeating letters? But let\'s avoid for now? Also, we need 5 distinct? No, can have repeats.\n\nBut in this case, we are putting R at positions 2 and 3? And E at 4? That might be messy.\n\nBetter to try R at position 1. For example, ""ROUSE"":\n- R at 1 (which wasn\'t guessed before? Actually, we guessed C at 1 so we don\'t know about R at 1)\n- O at 2: new\n- U at 3: new\n- S at 4: new\n- E at 5: but we must avoid E at 5? Because first guess said E is not at 5? So if we try E at 5 again, and it shows \'-\' that tells us E is still not at 5? But we already know E is not at 5? So no new information? Worse, if we put E at 5 and it becomes \'✓\', that would be new? But the first feedback said \'-\' for E at 5 meaning that the secret word has E but not at position 5? So E cannot be at position 5? Therefore, putting E at 5 again will definitely be \'-\', so we avoid? We should use E in a different position.\n\nSo let\'s avoid position 5 for E? We can put E at 1, 2, 3, 4? But note E wasn\'t tried elsewhere.\n\nWord: ""RESET"": \n- R(1) E(2) S(3) E(4) T(5) -> but we have two E? Also, we put R at 1 and E at 2? But we don\'t know if E can be at 2? And we avoid E at 5? Wait T at 5 is new? But we have E also at 4? We are testing multiple E? But we don\'t know if we have one or two E? Since the first guess had E at 5 and got \'-\' meaning one E? Actually, \'-\' indicates that letter is present but in wrong position? It doesn\'t say how many? So there could be multiple E? However, we only got one \'-\' for E? That doesn\'t prevent another E? But possibly minimal? Let\'s stick to words without repeats?\n\nBut ""RESET"" has two E? Also, we have S and T which are new.\n\nAlternatively, how about ""RISEN""? But we avoid N? So can\'t use N.\n\nWhat about ""BRIEF"":\n- B at 1\n- R at 2 -> same position as first guess? We know R not at 2? So move?\n- B at 1, R at 2 -> problem with R at 2.\n\nWe need a word where R is not at 2 and E is not at 5? And contains only letters that haven\'t been ruled out? Ruled out: C, A, N.\n\nSo: ""PRIZE""? But Z is uncommon? Also, we don\'t want Q, Z, X? Better common letters.\n\n""TRIER"" ? R at 4? And E at 3? But T at 1? But ""TRIER"" has repeated R? Doesn\'t matter? But let me think.\n\nPerhaps: ""ROUND""? But we avoid N? So skip.\n\n""HEART""? But we avoid A? Because feedback said A is absent? And T? H? But ""HEART"": H E A R T -> A is absent? So skip.\n\nAnother idea: ""DOZER""? Avoid Z? And O?\n\nBetter: ""STELE""? Uncommon? Or ""TRICE"" -> avoid C.\n\nLet me try to form a word: \nLet\'s put R at the beginning: R at position 1.\nE at position 4? Then we need letters not ruled out? So positions: 1: R, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: E, 5: ?\n\nLetters we haven\'t guessed: For position 2, we can use B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, etc.\n\nFor example: ""RULER"": \n- R at 1: good position? we don\'t know yet? \n- U at 2: new vowel?\n- L at 3: new consonant?\n- E at 4: new position? \n- R at 5: but R might be repeated? \n\nBut ""RULER"" has two R: but we don\'t know if the word has repeated letters? However, we know R is present? If we don\'t get two R in the feedback, we\'ll know? So it\'s acceptable? Also avoids C,A,N.\n\nBut E is at position 4? Which is different from the previous guess at 5? So that\'s good.\n\nAlternatively: ""RODEO"" avoid? It has only 5? But O repeated? And E? ""R O D E O"" -> the word must be English? And ""rodeo"" is a English word? But we don\'t know?\n\nBut let\'s consider more common words.\n\nAnother idea: ""PROBE""? P,R,O,B,E -> \n- R at position 2? Ah, same position as first guess? We should avoid R at position2? Because we know it\'s not R? So let\'s move R: position 2 is bad? Then put R at 1? Or 3? \n\nSo ""PERIL"" might work? \n- P at 1, E at 2, R at 3? But R at 3: hasn\'t been guessed at that position? And E at 2: hasn\'t been guessed? \n- Positions: 1: P? 2: E? 3: R? 4: I? 5: L?\n\nSo we would be testing E at position 2? We don\'t know if it\'s there? And avoiding E at 5? Also, we have R at position 3? So not position2? Good? But wait: if E is at 2, it might be ok? But we don\'t have any information about position2 except it\'s not R? It could be E? Or not?\n\nSo ""PERIL"" might be a good choice? \n\nOr ""SERUM"": \n- S at 1, E at 2, R at 3? Same as above? Then U at4, M at5.\n\nBut same pattern? Let\'s choose ""PERIL""? Or ""METRO"": \n- M at1, E at2, T at3, R at4, O at5 -> but E is at2? And R at4.\n\nBut we avoid putting E at5? So that\'s fine? We have E at2? Which wasn\'t used?\n\nHowever, note we don\'t have any feedback about position2? Only that it wasn\'t R? But we don\'t know if it is E? Or any other letter.\n\nAnother word: ""TREES""? Too many E? Avoid?\n\nI think ""PERIL"" is a good choice? \n\nBut let\'s see: we have R and E in new positions? Yes? \n- First guess: R at pos2? Now R at pos3? E was at pos5? Now E at pos2? \n\nLetters to cover: P, E, R, I, L? But I and L are vowels? Consonants? \n\nP is new, E we know is present? R we know is present? I is vowel? L is consonant? We haven tested P,I,L.\n\nAlternatively, how about ""BLIER""? Uncommon? Or ""CRIER""? Avoid C.\n\n""DRIVE"": D R at pos2? Avoid R at pos2? So no? Because we put R at pos2? We shouldn\'t put R at pos2? Because we know pos2 is not R? So we avoid pos2? Therefore, ""DRIVE"" has R at pos2? Discard.\n\nSo ""PERIL"" seems acceptable? Or ""MOVER"": M O V E R? V? And E at position4? And R at5? \n\nBut V? Could be? \n\nBut let me choose a word that has common letters? \n\nI think ""STEEL""? But double E? And E at position5? Avoid position5 for E? \n\nSo I decide on ""PERIL"". \n\nBut note: we guessed ""crane"": \n- R is present? But now we put R at position3? \n- E is present? But we put E at position2? \n\nIt might be? \n\nAlternatively, ""STREW"": \n- S T R E W -> \n- Position2 is T? \n- Position3 is R? \n- Position4 is E? \n- Avoid position5 for E? Put E at4? \n- So: 1: S, 2: T, 3: R, 4: E, 5: W? Word ""strew""? \n\nBut R is at position3? And E at position4? \n\nThis avoids position2 for R and position5 for E? Also tested new letters: S, T, W? \n\nAlso avoids C,A,N? \n\nI think that\'s a good candidate? \n\nAnother option: ""BORED"" -> B O R E D? R at position3? E at position4? And avoid E at5? \n- Positions: B(1), O(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). Also avoids redundant position for R? \n\nCommonality? ""strew"" might be less common? \n\nOr ""GIVEN""? Avoid N? Cannot.\n\nI think ""BORED"" is a good word? But does it have all common letters? \n\nAlso ""TOGUE""? Uncommon? \n\nLet me go with ""BORED""? \n\nBut we have O? Which is vowel? \n\nAnother word: ""QUERY""? Q might be rare? \n\nSo ""BORED"" sounds common? \n\nBut let me look: \n- We know from feedback that the secret word has R and E? So if we put R and E in positions 3 and 4? But we haven\'t tested the positions? \n\nI think ""BORED"" is a reasonable second guess? \n\nBut wait: could R be at position1? We haven\'t tested position1? So perhaps we should try R at position1? \n\nSimilarly, E might be at position1? \n\nBut we have B? Or T? etc. \n\nLet\'s choose a word with R at position1? For example, ""RADII""? Avoid A? Cannot. \n\n""ROBES"": \n- R O B E S? \n- R at1? \n- O at2? \n- B at3? \n- E at4? \n- S at5? \nAvoids E at5? \nAlso avoids A,N? \n\nSo ""ROBES""?\n\nBut O at2? We don\'t know? And E at4? \n\nThis way we test R at position1? \n\nBut we already know R is present? So if R is at position1 and we guess it, it will be \'✓\'? Or if not, \'-\' meaning it\'s elsewhere? \n\nWe want to know the position? So testing R at position1 might be good? \n\nSimilarly, E at4? \n\nPlus, letters O,B,S? \n\nI think ""ROBES"" is a good second guess? \n\nI\'ll go with that? \n\nBut note: we haven\'t used S? And it\'s common? \n\nI think ""ROBES"" is a valid and reasonable guess? \n\nTherefore, my second guess is ""robes"". \n\nWait, but let me confirm: \n- First guess: ""crane"" -> feedback C(x), R(-) meaning R is present but not at pos2? \n- Second guess: ""robes"" has R at position1? So if the secret word has R at position1, we get \'✓\' for that? If not, we get \'-\'? \n\nAlso E at position4? If E is at position4, we get \'✓\'? Or if not? Since E is present but how? \n\nSo it\'s a good test.\n\nThus, I choose ""ROBES"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)), we know:\n- The secret word contains R and E, but R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5.\n- The letters C, A, and N are absent from the word.\n- R must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (positions not confirmed or tested properly yet).\n- E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is incorrect).\n\nFor the second guess, we should:\n1. Include R and E to verify their positions.\n2. Avoid C, A, N entirely.\n3. Use common letters to maximize information gain.\n4. Preferably place R and E in new, untested positions (e.g., R not at position 2, E not at position 5).\n5. Cover additional high-frequency letters like B, O, S, etc.\n\nA suitable word is **""ROBES""**:\n- R at position 1: Tests if R is in the first position (if correct ✓, or wrong ─ but we already know R is present).\n- O at position 2: New vowel and position we have no information about.\n- B at position 3: New consonant, tests another common letter.\n- E at position 4: New position for E (not position 5).\n- S at position 5: New consonant and position.\n\nThis guess efficiently checks potential positions for R and E while introducing three new letters (O, B, S) to gain more feedback.\n\n<guess>robes</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: robes -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) B(x) E(-) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses and feedback:\n1. crane: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n   - R and E are in the word, but R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.\n   - C, A, N are not in the word.\n\n2. robes: R(-) O(x) B(x) E(-) S(x)\n   - R(-): R is in the word but not in position 1 (since guess had R at 1).\n   - O(x): O is not in the word.\n   - B(x): B is not in the word.\n   - E(-): E is in the word but not in position 4 (since guess had E at 4).\n   - S(x): S is not in the word.\n\nCombined information:\n- Letters in the word: R, E (from both guesses)\n- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, O, B, S (from x marks)\n- R\'s position: Cannot be position 1 (from robes feedback) or position 2 (from crane feedback). So R must be in position 3 or 4 (since position 5 is possible? Wait, positions are 1-5. We\'ve ruled out 1 and 2, so R in 3,4, or possibly 5? But note: crane had R at position 2, which was wrong, but we didn\'t rule out position 5 for R? We need to consider all positions).\n\nSpecifically for R:\n- From crane: R is in the word, not at pos2.\n- From robes: R is in the word, not at pos1.\nSo R must be at position 3, 4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly for E:\n- From crane: E is in the word, not at pos5.\n- From robes: E is in the word, not at pos4.\nSo E must be at position 1, 2, or 3.\n\nAlso, note that the secret word has only the letters we know (R and E) plus three other letters that must be among the remaining unused letters? And we have ruled out: C, A, N, O, B, S. So these are not in the word.\n\nAvailable letters: We need to use letters that haven\'t been ruled out. Ruled out: C,A,N,O,B,S.\n\nCommon letters left: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z but avoid rare ones? Probably avoid Q, Z, X? Focus on common: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.\n\nAlso, we have two positions to consider: R must be in 3,4,5 and E in 1,2,3.\n\nNow, we need to form a word that includes R and E and avoids the ruled-out letters.\n\nLet me list possible positions:\n\nPosition 1: Could be? We have no information? But it cannot be R? (ruled by robes) and cannot be any of the x? So position 1 must be a new letter? Or E? Because E can be at position1? Similarly, position2: cannot be R? But what about E? Position2 could be E? Or other.\n\nBut we know from crane that position3 was A and it\'s absent? So position3 in secret word is not A? Similarly, position4 was N? absent? position5? E was absent? But position5 was E with \'-\' meaning E is in word but not at position5? So position5 could be any of the letters? But we also know E cannot be at position5? And position5 was tested again in robes? With E? But we put E at position4? So position5 in secret word hasn\'t been directly tested? It could be R? Or E? But E cannot be at position5? So position5 must be either R or a letter we haven\'t guessed? \n\nWait: E cannot be at position5? Because crane feedback said E(-) at pos5? Then robes feedback said E(-) at pos4? So E must be elsewhere? Similarly, R cannot be at position1 or position2? \n\nSo possible positions for:\n- E: 1,2,3\n- R: 3,4,5\n\nWe need to think of words that satisfy the constraints? \n\nAlso, note: since R and E can both be at position3? That would be acceptable? For example, the word could have E at position3 and R at position3? No, one position? Unless repeated letters? But we don\'t know? We don\'t have evidence of repeated letters? So let\'s assume no repeats? Or allow? But possibly the word has distinct letters? \n\nWe need to form a word? \n\nCommon words: \n\nSet R at position3: then E can be at 1,2? (since at3 would conflict? Unless same letter? Not possible? So E at position1 or2? \n\nSimilarly, set R at position4: then E at1,2,3? \n\nOr R at position5: then E at1,2,3? \n\nNow, try examples? \n\nFor example, if R is at position3? Then we need E? at position1 or2? \n\nPossible word: LETTER? But we have double T? And T? But LETTER has 6 letters? No! \n\nWord must be 5 letter? \n\nStart E: Let E be at position1? \n\nThen word must contain R? and avoid C,A,N,O,B,S? \n\nExample: E _ _ _ R? Because if R at position5? Then E at1? Middle? \n\nBut E must be? \n\nPossible word: ""ELDER""? \n- E(1) L D E(4) R(5)? Wait, repeated E? And E at position4? But we know E cannot be at position4? Because robes feedback said E(-) at position4? So position4 cannot be E? And we have E at position4? Not allowed? \n\nSo ""ELDER"" has E at position4? Which is forbidden? Because we know from robes that the secret word does not have E at position4? \n\nSimilarly, any word? \n\nPosition4 cannot be E? As per feedback? So we need to avoid E at position4? \n\nTherefore, for the word: \n- E can only be at position1,2,3? \n- R at position3,4,5? \n\nNow, if we put R at position5? Then E at position1,2,or3? \n\nWith any letters? \n\nWord: ""EXERT""? \n- E X E R T? But repeated E? And X? Not common? \n\nAvoid? \n\nWord: ""EARTH""? But A is absent? So skip.\n\nMust avoid C,A,N,O,B,S? \n\nOne possibility: ""MERRY""? \n- M E R R Y? \n- E at position2? \n- R at position3 and4? But we have R?\n- Then R at position3 and4? \n- But position5 Y? \nBut we are testing? And R is multiple? \n\nBut feedback: We have R in the word? And position3? And4? But wait: \n\nIn ""MERRY"": \n- Position1: M \n- Position2: E \n- Position3: R \n- Position4: R \n- Position5: Y \n\nIf the secret word has only one R? Then one R would match? But we have two R? So feedback might show different? \n\nPerhaps avoid repeated letters for now? \n\nAnother word: ""TIRED""?\n- T I R E D\n- Position1 T? \n- Position2 I? \n- Position3 R? \n- Position4 E? -> BUT we know that E cannot be at position4? Because we tested with robes? Position4 was E? And we got E(-)? Meaning E is in the word? But position4 is not E? So E cannot be at position4? \n\nTherefore, ""TIRED"" has E at position4? Which is forbidden? \n\nSo we cannot use words with E at position4? \n\nSimilarly, cannot R at position1 or position2? \n\nPossible words? \n\nLet me try to set E at position1? R at position5? Then middle letters? \n\nWord: ""EATER""? But A absent? Skip.\n\n""EDGER""? D,G? But we have E at1? Position4? But we cannot have E at4? So skip? \n\n""EIDER""? Avoid? That bird? And has D? But E at1 and E at? ""EIDER"": E I D E R? Position4 is E? So again E at position4? Forbidden? \n\nHow about ""EGRET""? Avoid? Has G? But E at1 and E at5? But E at5? But crane feedback said E(-) at position5? So E cannot be at position5? Also robes had S(x) at5? \n\nSo ""EGRET"" has E at position5? Skip? \n\nWords with E at1 and R at5 and no E elsewhere? \n\nExample: ""ENTER""? Avoid? But N is absent? Crane: N(x)? N not in word? So break? \n\n""EVERY""? Avoid? V and Y? But it has E at1? And R at4? Then E at1? \n- E V E R Y? \n- Position4: R? \n- Position1: E? \n- Position2: V? \n- Position3: E? -> E at position3? Which is allowed? \nBut avoid? Double E? And we have E at position3? \n\nBut not position4? \n\nBut note: we have only two E? But what about the feedback? \n\nIf we guess ""EVERY"", we hope? \n\nBut let\'s think: R is at position4? Which is allowed? \n\nWe need to avoid O,B,S? Etc? \n\nBut ""every"" is a word? \n\nNow, possible? \n\nBut we also have Y at the end? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nAlternatively, consider E at position2? And R at position3? \n\nWord: ""LEPER""? L E P E R? Has double E? And E at2? E at4? But position4 is E? Forbidden? \n\nBad? \n\nE at position2? R at position5? \n\nWord: ""METRO""? But O is absent? Skip.\n\n""MERCY""? C absent? \n\n""TERRY""? T E R R Y? But R at3 and4? \n\nE at2? \n\nAvoid? \n\nWord: ""PERRY""? Avoid? P E R R Y? But E at position2? R at3,4? \n\nWe have ruled out letters? \n\nAnother idea: R at position3? E at position2? \n\nWord: ? Example: ""BERYL""? But B absent? And Y? \n\n""MERIT""? But O? Wait: M E R I T? \n- Position1: M? \n- Position2: E? \n- Position3: R? \n- Position4: I? \n- Position5: T? \nAvoids forbidden letters? \n- Letters in ""MERIT"": M,E,R,I,T? \n- Check absent letters: C? absent? A? absent? N? absent? O? absent? B? absent? S? absent? \nSo no forbidden letters? \n\nAlso:\n- E at position2? Was not forbidden? \n- R at position3? Was not tested? \n- We avoid E at4 and E at5? \n\nSo ""MERIT"" might be a good guess? \n\nSimilarly, does it satisfy position constraints? \n- E could be at position2? \n- R at position3? \n- And E and R are present? \n\nThus, I think ""MERIT"" is a good third guess? \n\nBut we also need to test for possible R at position4 or5? \n\nIn ""MERIT"", we have R at position3? So if R is at position3 in the secret word? Then we get feedback? \n\nIf R is not at3? Then it will show \'-\' meaning R is in the word? But position4? Then we will know? Similarly? \n\nWe also introduce M and I and T? \n\nI and T are common letters? \n\nSo yes? \n\nWe might guess ""MERIT"". \n\nAnother possibility? R at position4? E at position3? \n\nWord: ""FIERY""? But F I E R Y? Then E at3? Position4 R? \n- Also I and F? And Y? \nBut ""merit"" might be more common? \n\n""VERGE""? V E R G E? But E at position2 and position5? Position5 forbidden? Cannot have E at5? \n\nSo skip? \n\nTherefore, I choose ""MERIT"". \n\nSo guess: ""MERIT"". \n\nBut let me be sure: \n\nSummary:\n- Secret word must have R and E? and three other letters? \n- We ruled out: C, A, N, O, B, S? \n- ""MERIT"": uses M,E,R,I,T? \n- E at position2: acceptable? \n- R at position3? \n- If R is actually at position4? then we get \'-\' in R? and feedback will tell? \n\nIt\'s good.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses, here\'s the key information:\n- **Crane**: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-) → R and E are in the word, but R is not at position 2, and E is not at position 5. C, A, N are absent.\n- **Robes**: R(-) O(x) B(x) E(-) S(x) → R is not at position 1, E is not at position 4. O, B, S are absent.\n- **Letters confirmed in the word**: R, E.\n- **Letters ruled out (absent)**: C, A, N, O, B, S.\n- **R position constraints**: Cannot be at position 1 or 2, so must be at 3, 4, or 5.\n- **E position constraints**: Cannot be at position 4 or 5, so must be at 1, 2, or 3.\n- The secret word includes R and E, plus three other letters from the remaining pool: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y (avoiding rare letters like Q, X, Z).\n\nFor the third guess:\n- We need to test possible positions for R and E while introducing new common letters.\n- A good candidate is **""MERIT""**:\n  - Positions E at 2 (untested, valid position) and R at 3 (untested, valid position).\n  - Letters M, I, T are new and common.\n  - Avoids ruled-out letters and forbidden E/R positions.\n\nThis guess maximizes information on E/R placement and tests three additional common letters.\n\n<guess>merit</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: robes -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) B(x) E(-) S(x)\nGuess 3: merit -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(✓) R(-) I(x) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
From the feedback for ""merit"": M(x) E(✓) R(-) I(x) T(x)

Breakdown:
- M(x): M is not in the word.
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 2).
- R(-): R is in the word but in the WRONG position (here, position 3).
- I(x): I is not in the word.
- T(x): T is not in the word.

So now we know:
- E is fixed at position 2: the secret word has _ E _ _ _ 
- R is present but not at position 3. Since we knew R couldn't be at 1 or 2 (from previous feedback), and now position 3 is also wrong, R must be at position 4 or 5.
- Letters ruled out: C, A, N, O, B, S, M, I, T (from all x's).
- Confirmed letters in word: R and E (with E at position 2).

Now, confirmed absent: C, A, N, O, B, S, M, I, T  
So available letters: D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y, etc. (common letters: D, G, H, K, L, P, U, Y, etc.)

Constraints:
- Position 1: Must be a letter not ruled out; also, not E or R (since E is at 2, and R not here unless it's position 1, but R can't be at position 1). Position 1 cannot be R (from robes feedback) and has never been tested directly except through R in robes which was wrong. So position 1 is unknown but not R and none of the ruled-out letters.
- Position 2: E (fixed).
- Position 3: We guessed R here and got (-), so it's wrong, and we also know from merit feedback that it cannot be R. Moreover, since I(x) and previously A(x) and N(x), position 3 is not I, A, N, or any ruled-out letter. It must be a new letter or one of the available.
- Position 4: Unknown, but R could be here or at 5? Also cannot be E? Wait no: E is at position 2? Position 4 could be another E? But we have no evidence of repeated letters? Probably single E? But not necessarily? But let's assume no repeats for efficiency? Or consider? But E has only been hinted once? But we only got one E with ✓? Doesn't mean no repeat? But we can only know by testing.

However, from crane and robes, we know E is present and was at position 5 and position 4? But position 5 showed '-' which could mean one E elsewhere? If there was another E at another position? It wouldn't say both? The feedback only says yes if present? But it marks per position? So for example in crane: E is present? But not at5? So if we had E at position1? Then crane would show E. But since we guessed E only at5, so if E is also at position1? It wouldn't show? Unless we guessed it? So there might be extra E? So possibly multiple E? But we don't have evidence? Not necessary? So I think we can proceed with single letter? 

Given that, we focus: R must be at position 4 or 5 because positions 1,2,3 are impossible for R? Position: 
- Position 1: Not available (robes feedback: R not at1? Also we guessed R? 
- Position 2: Is E? So cannot be R? 
- Position 3: We guessed R and got (-), meaning not at3? 
- Positions 4 and 5 are only possibilities left? 

E is only at position2? So positions 1,3,4,5 cannot be E? Or could they? Wait, no: we know E is only at position2? Because we have E(✓) at position2? So secret word has E at position2? Therefore, positions 1,3,4,5 cannot have E? Because each letter? Position2 is E? So other positions cannot be E? Unless repeated letters? 

But if there were repeated E, we might have multiple E? But in this case? Crane and robes showed only one E was present? But not necessarily? For example, if the word had E twice? Then in crane when we guessed E only once? But at position5? It showed '-' meaning E is present? But not at position5? And also robes guessed E at position4? Showed '-' meaning E present but not at position4? But it doesn't show how many E? So there could be multiple E? 

But with merit feedback E at position2? Now we have one E fixed? And merit had only E at position2? But the secret word could have E at position2 and perhaps another? But we don't know? 

To minimize? Let's initially exclude repeated letters? Or consider? But we can try to avoid? 

Position 3: We know it cannot be R (from merit) and cannot be E (since position2 is E? But if E is repeated it could? Wait? Position3 could be E? But we have E(✓) at position2? So if secret word has E at position2? It doesn't prevent E at position3? But in the guess? We didn't guess E at position3? We guessed R at3? And I at4? Etc.

So possibility: secret word could have E at position3 as well? But that would conflict? Because position2 is E? And if position3 also E? Then when we guessed merit: at position2 E(✓) means correct position? But position3 we guessed R which is wrong? If the secret word has E at position3? Then we should have gotten another E feedback? How? 

In merit guess: positions: 1:M, 2:E (got ✓), 3:R (got -), 4:I (x), 5:T (x)

If secret word had E also at position3? Then at position3 we guessed R? Which is not E? So it should be '-' or 'x'? But feedback gave R(-) meaning R is present but not at this position? So it doesn't indicate anything about E? Because we guessed R? Not E? So E at position3? If secret word? But we didn't guess it? So the feedback doesn't reveal it? 

Thus, it's possible? But let's not complicate? And assume single E? Then position3 cannot be E? Similarly, positions 1,4,5 cannot be E? 

Therefore, we have:
- Position 1: ??? 
- Position 2: E (fixed)
- Position 3: ??? (cannot be R, cannot be E? If single E? And not ruled-out letters)
- Position 4: ???  (could be R? Or other)
- Position 5: ???  (could be R? Or other)

But R must be at position4 or position5? Since excluded from 1,2,3.

Now, for the missing letters: 
We know two letters: E and R? So we need to find three more letters? Not in the ruled-out list? 

Ruled-out letters: C, A, N, O, B, S, M, I, T? 
Available: A to Z except these? But let's list common: D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y? 

Possible words: 
Pattern: _ E _ _ _ 
With R in position4 or position5?
And the other two letters? Also position1 and position3? 

First case: R at position4? 
Then word: _ E _ R _ 
Second case: R at position5? 
Then word: _ E _ _ R 

We need to fill with three other letters? But wait: the word has five positions? 
Positions: 1, 2=E, 3, 4 or R, 5 or R.

Also, we guess ""merit"" which had E at2? R at3? But I and T and M absent? 

Now, we need possible words? 

Since we have limited tries? We should pick a guess that covers many possible options? 

Let me think of common words ending with R or having R at4? 

First, if R at5? Then word: _ E _ _ R? 

Examples: ""JESUS""? But S ruled out? 
""FEVER""? F E V E R? F: new? V: new? E? But E at position4? But position4: E? But we don't know? Also S absent? 

But check ruled-out: S absent? But ""FEVER"": F E V E R? 
Position4: E? Position5: R? 
We ruled out? We don't have rules against F,V? Or multiple E? 

But in feedback? crane had E at5 wrong? robes had E at4 wrong? So position4 cannot be E? But in this guess? Position4 is E? So if we guess a word with E at4? It would be wrong? 

Similarly? But we want to avoid that? So position4 cannot be E because we got E(-) at4 in robes? 

Similarly? Position5 cannot be E? 

So for FEVER? If it has E at position4? But we know E cannot be at position4? So secret word cannot be ""FEVER""? 

Therefore? Because E at position4 would have been detected? Not possible? 

Similarly? Only one E possibility? 

So assume secret word has single E? at position2? 

Thus position3,4,5 not E? 

So _ E _ _ _ , with E only? 

Then with R at4 or5? 

Now? Let's list possible letters for position1,3, and either 4 or5 one letter? 

Filling:
- Position1: one of available letters? 
- Position3: one of available letters? 
- Position4: either R? or a letter? 
- Position5: either R? or letter? 

But depending on which? 

Set R at position5? So pattern: _ E _ * R, where * is a letter? 

Then the missing letter is position3 and position4? But positions: 1, 2=E, 3=letter, 4=letter, 5=R? 

Example words? 

Like: ""DEWER""? But W? And E? But E at position2 only? 
""LEVEL""? But L E V E L? Double E? And position4 E? But E at position4 forbidden? 

Avoid E? 

So words: without E elsewhere? With available letters? 

For example: 
- ""HEPAR""? Uncommon? 
- ""DEFER""? F E E? Double E? Position4 E? Forbidden? 
""LEPER""? L E P E R? Double E? 
""PETER""? P E T E R? But T ruled out? T absent? 

Must avoid? 

If R at position5? Then words ending R? Like: ""DEVOR""? Not word? 
""LEMUR""? M ruled out? 
""LEVER""? Double E? 

All have issues? 

Perhaps R at position4? Then pattern: _ E _ R _ 

Example: ""HEART""? But A absent? 
""DEPTH""? D E P T H? T is absent? 
""LEG R?""? 
""YER R?""? 

Word: ""REFER""? But E repeated? 
""SEER?""? But S absent? 

Available letters: D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y? Etc. 

Possible words? 
- ""HEFTY""? F T Y? T absent? Cannot. 
- ""WEARY""? O absent? 
- ""KEBAR""? Uncommon? 
- ""FEWER""? F E W E R? Double E? Position4 R? Position5 R? Wait? ""FEWER""? F E W E R? Position4: E? Which is forbidden? 

Similarly? With E at position4? Not allowed? 

Thus? We need words without E except at2? And without ruled-out letters? 

List of possible word structures? 

Case 1: R at position5: word pattern: ? E ? ? R  
Positions: 1: letter, 3: letter, 4: letter? 
R is at5? So position4 must be a letter? 

Word: letter E letter letter R? 

With letters from available pool? 

Example: ""JEHIR""? Not word? 
""LEVIR""? Not common? 
""PENIR""? Absent? 

Common word: ""DEUCE""? E at3? But we must have E only at2? So position3 here is U? 
""DEUCE"": D E U C E? But C absent? and E repeated? 
Bad? 

""LEECH""? L E E C H? Double E? And C absent? 

""PEYER""? P E Y E R? Double E? And E at4? Forbidden? 

Only possibility? 

But we have ""GIVER""? G I V E R? But I absent? 

Cannot? 

Case 2: R at position4: pattern: ? E ? R ? 
So: position1: letter? position3: letter? position5: letter? 
R at4? 

Example: ""DEARY""? D E A R Y? A absent? 
""HEARD""? H E A R D? A absent? 
""BER T?""? Absent? 

""FEINT""? F E I N T? But I absent? N absent? 
""WEIRD""? W E I R D? I absent? 

""YER K?""? 

Let's think ""LEPER"" but double E? 

Perhaps ""KYDER""? Uncommon? 

""FLIER""? But L? I? absent? 

But F,L, but I absent? 

No ""L""?

How about ""FLYER""? F L Y E R? But position4 is E? R at5? 
""FLYER"": F L Y E R? But that's position1 F, 2 L? 3 Y? 4 E? 5 R? 
But we have E at position4? Which we know is not allowed? Because robes put E at position4 and got '-' meaning E not at position4? 

Similarly? We cannot have E at position4? 

Therefore? Only words with no E except at position2, and R at position4 or position5, but with other letters. 

Another word: ""DEVIL""? D E V I L? But I absent? 
""HEMAL""? M absent? 

I think I missed a possibility? Position5 could be a letter? But not E? 

For R at position4: word: 1: X? 2:E? 3:Y? 4:R? 5:Z? 
 or for R at position5: word: 1:X? 2:E? 3:Y? 4:Z? 5:R? 

With X, Y, Z from available: D,F,G,H,K,L,P,U,V,W,Y? Etc. 

Now, common words? for R at position4: ""UDDER""? No R? 
""UMBER""? U M B E R? M absent? B absent? 

LETTER? L E T T E R? Banned? T absent? and E repeated? Cannot? 

""PUREE""? P U R E E? E at5? And not standard? 

The only common word I can think of is ""LURER""? L U R E R? but E not at2? And E at4? 
""ERROR""? E not at2? 

Not? 

Perhaps we need to consider that R might not be on its own? But it must be? 

Another possibility: ""ERRED""? E R R E D? But we have position1:E? But secret word has E at position2? Cannot have E at1? 

Word must have position2 E? 

So pattern: _ E _ _ _ 

With R at4 or5? 

Let me search? 
- Words: ""DETER""? D E T E R? T absent? E repeated? Bad? 
""HEBER""? H E B E R? B absent? 
""LEGER""? L E G E R? E at4? Forbidden? 
""PAGER""? A absent? 
""SEVER""? S absent? 

Perhaps ""DEUCE"" but C? 

I think we may have ""VE RY?""? 

""VERGE""? V E R G E? E at position2? R at position3? But in ""VERGE"": positions: V E R G E? Position3 R? Position4 G? Position5 E? 
But R at position3? We have already ruled out R at position3? If we use ""VERGE"", but we know R is not at position3? So cannot? 

Similarly? 

Only possibility with R at position5: ""HEDER""? H E D E R? Double E? and E at4? 
""WEDER""? Like? 

But let's think: ""FEMME""? No R? 

Perhaps we should guess a word that has R at position4 or5 and new letters? 

But we have limited letters? 

For example, put R at position4? So pattern: _ E _ R _ 

Then guess: ""GEY ER""? Not? 

""PEERY""? P E E R Y? Double E? And E at position3? 
""PEERY"": P E E R Y? Position1:P, 2:E, 3:E (which we can allow? But if secret word has E at position3, then it's possible? 

But previously? Crane had E at position5? Which was wrong? Robes had E at position4 wrong? Merit had E at position2 correct? So if secret word has E at position3? It is a repeat? 

But we never tested position3 for E? 

In merit? At position3 we guessed R? Not E? So we don't know if there is E at position3? 

Similarly? It's possible? 

But then the secret word would have two E? At positions 2 and 3? 

For example, the secret word could be ""ME E R something""? 

But position3 is E? 

But pattern _ E E something? 

With R at position4 or5? But position4 R? Or not. 

Example: ""GREET""? G R E E T? But R at position2? But we have position2 must be E? So secret word has positions. 

For secret word with two E: at 2 and 3? Then pattern: _ E E _ _ 

But because R must be at4 or5? So "" E E R?""? 

Word: ""LEERs""? L E E R S? But S absent? 
""BEERY""? B absent? 
""JEERY""? J? Uncommon? 
""VEERY""? V E E R Y? 

""VEERY"" is a bird? 

But let's see? Letters: V,E,E,R,Y? Available? V? Not ruled out? E at position3? Y? 

Also, R at position4? 

So possible? 

But we have two E? Position2 and 3? 

Then feedback for merit: we guessed E at position2 correctly? R at position3: if secret word has E at position3? Then we guessed R which is not present at3? But R is in the word? At position4? So merit: position3 should be? If secret word has E at position3? We guessed R at position3? Which is wrong? So it should be not R? But since R is at position4? Then the feedback for position3: R(-) means R is in the word but not at position3? Which is correct? 

Similarly? E at position3 doesn't conflict? 

Therefore? We should consider ""VEERY"" as a candidate? 

But V is not common? 

Or another word: ""LEERY""? L E E R Y? Same as above? With L? 

But S absent? 

""LEERY"": L E E R Y? Letters L,E,E,R,Y? 
Available? L not ruled out? E allowed? R at position4? Y at5? 

Previously ruled out c,a,n,o,b,s,m,i,t? So L? Available? Y? Available? 

So possible? 

Similarly? ""PEERY""? P E E R Y? 

Or ""NEVER""? N absent? 

Among common options? ""LEERY"" might be acceptable? 

Perhaps ""WEARY""? But A absent? And O? 

No? 

So ""VEERY"" or ""LEERY"" etc? 

But we need to guess wisely? 

Since we don t have many letters? Perhaps guess ""LEERY"" if that's the word? 

But let's see other possibilities? 

Without double E? 

For example? ""HEFTY"" not? T absent? 

""KEDGE""? K E D G E? Double E? 
""PUDGE""? P U D G E? Double E? 
 etc? 

So perhaps double E at positions 2 and 3 is common? 

With R at position4? 

So words like ""LEERY"", ""VEERY"", ""BEERY"" (B absent)? 

""DEARY"" D E A R Y? A absent? 
""SEARY"" S absent? 

Therefore? ""LEERY"" is a good candidate? 

Or ""PEERY""? 

But ""LEERY"" more common? 

Now, also R at position5? With E at position2? 

Then word: _ E _ _ R 

With possible double E? Like at position3? So _ E E _ R? 

Example: ""MEET R"" ""MEETR"" not? 
""LEETR"" not? 
""BEERS"" S absent? 

So less common? 

Thus, most likely R at position4? with E at position2 and possibly E at position3? 

But in LEERY? E at position2 and3? 

So possible? 

For the guess? Since we have only a few options? We could guess ""LEERY"" or something covering? 

But let's make a guess that distinguishes? 

For example, if we think there might be E at position3? Then guess a word with E at position3? But to test? 

Since we have only 3 tries left? 

Possible words without double E at position3? But are there any? If R at position5? 

For example: G E K L R? Not word? 
P E V E R? Double E? 

H E L I R? But I absent? 

U E F F R? Not word? 

So very few options? 

Therefore? the word might be one of the double E words? 

So I think ""LEERY"" is a possible word? 

Guess: ""LEERY""

Let's confirm letters: L,E,E,R,Y? 

But E repeated? 

Also feedback? Previous: if we guess ""LEERY"": 
- Position1 L? 
- Position2 E? Should be correct? 
- Position3 E? If secret word has E at position3? Then we get and it's correct? But we don't know? 
- Position4 R? 
- Position5 Y? 

If secret word has ""LEERY"", then feedback will show.

But in our case, the secret word has E at position2? And R must be at4 or5? If secret word has E at position2 and3? Then R at position4? 

So likely? 

Alternatively, if not, we get feedback and deduct? 

But we must avoid ruled-out letters? LEERY uses L,E,E,R,Y? No ruled-out? 

Thus, we guess ""LEERY""

If not, we will know. 

But let's see merit feedback: E(✓) at position2? And R(-) at position3? Meaning R not at3? So if secret has LEERY? Then E at2? Yes? E at3? We didn't guess E at3? So it doesn't show? But position3 in LEERY is E? And we guessed R? Which is not E? So symbol for position3 would be based on R? R is in the word? At position4? So we get '-' for R at3? 

So consistent? 

Therefore, it could be? 

Other words? ""YEVER"" not common? 

So I think ""LEERY"" is a good guess? 

Thus, my next guess is ""leery""

But for spelling: ""leery"" is a valid English word? Meaning wary? 

Yes? 

So guess: ""LEERY""
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from all guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(absent), R(present-wrong-position), A(absent), N(absent), E(present-wrong-position).  
  This reveals: R and E are in the word, but R is not at position 2, and E is not at position 5. C, A, N are absent.

- **Guess 2: robes** → Feedback: R(present-wrong-position), O(absent), B(absent), E(present-wrong-position), S(absent).  
  This reveals: R is not at position 1, E is not at position 4. O, B, S are absent, and the absence of S is new.

- **Guess 3: merit** → Feedback: M(absent), E(correct-position), R(present-wrong-position), I(absent), T(absent).  
  This reveals: E is fixed at position 2 (secret word pattern: _ E _ _ _). R is not at position 3 (so R must be at position 4 or 5). M, I, T are absent.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters**: R and E.
- **E position**: Fixed at position 2 (secret word pattern: `_ E _ _ _`).
- **R position**: Cannot be at positions 1, 2, or 3 → must be at 4 or 5.
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, O, B, S, M, I, T (10 letters ruled out).
- **Available pool**: D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y (common letters prioritized).
- **Possible word structures**:
  - R at position 4: `_ E _ R _`
  - R at position 5: `_ E _ _ R`
- Considering E may repeat (e.g., at position 3) since previous feedback doesn't rule it out. This fits common words like ""LEERY"" (which introduces multiple new letters).

Given this, **""LEERY""** is an optimal guess:
- Tests R at position 4.
- Introduces high-frequency letters L, Y (both new).
- Position 3 tests for possible E repeat (if present, we get feedback).
- Avoids ruled-out letters and fits E at position 2.

<guess>leery</guess>",leery,"From the feedback for ""merit"": M(x) E(✓) R(-) I(x) T(x)

Breakdown:
- M(x): M is not in the word.
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 2).
- R(-): R is in the word but in the WRONG position (here, position 3).
- I(x): I is not in the word.
- T(x): T is not in the word.

So now we know:
- E is fixed at position 2: the secret word has _ E _ _ _ 
- R is present but not at position 3. Since we knew R couldn't be at 1 or 2 (from previous feedback), and now position 3 is also wrong, R must be at position 4 or 5.
- Letters ruled out: C, A, N, O, B, S, M, I, T (from all x's).
- Confirmed letters in word: R and E (with E at position 2).

Now, confirmed absent: C, A, N, O, B, S, M, I, T  
So available letters: D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y, etc. (common letters: D, G, H, K, L, P, U, Y, etc.)

Constraints:
- Position 1: Must be a letter not ruled out; also, not E or R (since E is at 2, and R not here unless it's position 1, but R can't be at position 1). Position 1 cannot be R (from robes feedback) and has never been tested directly except through R in robes which was wrong. So position 1 is unknown but not R and none of the ruled-out letters.
- Position 2: E (fixed).
- Position 3: We guessed R here and got (-), so it's wrong, and we also know from merit feedback that it cannot be R. Moreover, since I(x) and previously A(x) and N(x), position 3 is not I, A, N, or any ruled-out letter. It must be a new letter or one of the available.
- Position 4: Unknown, but R could be here or at 5? Also cannot be E? Wait no: E is at position 2? Position 4 could be another E? But we have no evidence of repeated letters? Probably single E? But not necessarily? But let's assume no repeats for efficiency? Or consider? But E has only been hinted once? But we only got one E with ✓? Doesn't mean no repeat? But we can only know by testing.

However, from crane and robes, we know E is present and was at position 5 and position 4? But position 5 showed '-' which could mean one E elsewhere? If there was another E at another position? It wouldn't say both? The feedback only says yes if present? But it marks per position? So for example in crane: E is present? But not at5? So if we had E at position1? Then crane would show E. But since we guessed E only at5, so if E is also at position1? It wouldn't show? Unless we guessed it? So there might be extra E? So possibly multiple E? But we don't have evidence? Not necessary? So I think we can proceed with single letter? 

Given that, we focus: R must be at position 4 or 5 because positions 1,2,3 are impossible for R? Position: 
- Position 1: Not available (robes feedback: R not at1? Also we guessed R? 
- Position 2: Is E? So cannot be R? 
- Position 3: We guessed R and got (-), meaning not at3? 
- Positions 4 and 5 are only possibilities left? 

E is only at position2? So positions 1,3,4,5 cannot be E? Or could they? Wait, no: we know E is only at position2? Because we have E(✓) at position2? So secret word has E at position2? Therefore, positions 1,3,4,5 cannot have E? Because each letter? Position2 is E? So other positions cannot be E? Unless repeated letters? 

But if there were repeated E, we might have multiple E? But in this case? Crane and robes showed only one E was present? But not necessarily? For example, if the word had E twice? Then in crane when we guessed E only once? But at position5? It showed '-' meaning E is present? But not at position5? And also robes guessed E at position4? Showed '-' meaning E present but not at position4? But it doesn't show how many E? So there could be multiple E? 

But with merit feedback E at position2? Now we have one E fixed? And merit had only E at position2? But the secret word could have E at position2 and perhaps another? But we don't know? 

To minimize? Let's initially exclude repeated letters? Or consider? But we can try to avoid? 

Position 3: We know it cannot be R (from merit) and cannot be E (since position2 is E? But if E is repeated it could? Wait? Position3 could be E? But we have E(✓) at position2? So if secret word has E at position2? It doesn't prevent E at position3? But in the guess? We didn't guess E at position3? We guessed R at3? And I at4? Etc.

So possibility: secret word could have E at position3 as well? But that would conflict? Because position2 is E? And if position3 also E? Then when we guessed merit: at position2 E(✓) means correct position? But position3 we guessed R which is wrong? If the secret word has E at position3? Then we should have gotten another E feedback? How? 

In merit guess: positions: 1:M, 2:E (got ✓), 3:R (got -), 4:I (x), 5:T (x)

If secret word had E also at position3? Then at position3 we guessed R? Which is not E? So it should be '-' or 'x'? But feedback gave R(-) meaning R is present but not at this position? So it doesn't indicate anything about E? Because we guessed R? Not E? So E at position3? If secret word? But we didn't guess it? So the feedback doesn't reveal it? 

Thus, it's possible? But let's not complicate? And assume single E? Then position3 cannot be E? Similarly, positions 1,4,5 cannot be E? 

Therefore, we have:
- Position 1: ??? 
- Position 2: E (fixed)
- Position 3: ??? (cannot be R, cannot be E? If single E? And not ruled-out letters)
- Position 4: ???  (could be R? Or other)
- Position 5: ???  (could be R? Or other)

But R must be at position4 or position5? Since excluded from 1,2,3.

Now, for the missing letters: 
We know two letters: E and R? So we need to find three more letters? Not in the ruled-out list? 

Ruled-out letters: C, A, N, O, B, S, M, I, T? 
Available: A to Z except these? But let's list common: D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y? 

Possible words: 
Pattern: _ E _ _ _ 
With R in position4 or position5?
And the other two letters? Also position1 and position3? 

First case: R at position4? 
Then word: _ E _ R _ 
Second case: R at position5? 
Then word: _ E _ _ R 

We need to fill with three other letters? But wait: the word has five positions? 
Positions: 1, 2=E, 3, 4 or R, 5 or R.

Also, we guess ""merit"" which had E at2? R at3? But I and T and M absent? 

Now, we need possible words? 

Since we have limited tries? We should pick a guess that covers many possible options? 

Let me think of common words ending with R or having R at4? 

First, if R at5? Then word: _ E _ _ R? 

Examples: ""JESUS""? But S ruled out? 
""FEVER""? F E V E R? F: new? V: new? E? But E at position4? But position4: E? But we don't know? Also S absent? 

But check ruled-out: S absent? But ""FEVER"": F E V E R? 
Position4: E? Position5: R? 
We ruled out? We don't have rules against F,V? Or multiple E? 

But in feedback? crane had E at5 wrong? robes had E at4 wrong? So position4 cannot be E? But in this guess? Position4 is E? So if we guess a word with E at4? It would be wrong? 

Similarly? But we want to avoid that? So position4 cannot be E because we got E(-) at4 in robes? 

Similarly? Position5 cannot be E? 

So for FEVER? If it has E at position4? But we know E cannot be at position4? So secret word cannot be ""FEVER""? 

Therefore? Because E at position4 would have been detected? Not possible? 

Similarly? Only one E possibility? 

So assume secret word has single E? at position2? 

Thus position3,4,5 not E? 

So _ E _ _ _ , with E only? 

Then with R at4 or5? 

Now? Let's list possible letters for position1,3, and either 4 or5 one letter? 

Filling:
- Position1: one of available letters? 
- Position3: one of available letters? 
- Position4: either R? or a letter? 
- Position5: either R? or letter? 

But depending on which? 

Set R at position5? So pattern: _ E _ * R, where * is a letter? 

Then the missing letter is position3 and position4? But positions: 1, 2=E, 3=letter, 4=letter, 5=R? 

Example words? 

Like: ""DEWER""? But W? And E? But E at position2 only? 
""LEVEL""? But L E V E L? Double E? And position4 E? But E at position4 forbidden? 

Avoid E? 

So words: without E elsewhere? With available letters? 

For example: 
- ""HEPAR""? Uncommon? 
- ""DEFER""? F E E? Double E? Position4 E? Forbidden? 
""LEPER""? L E P E R? Double E? 
""PETER""? P E T E R? But T ruled out? T absent? 

Must avoid? 

If R at position5? Then words ending R? Like: ""DEVOR""? Not word? 
""LEMUR""? M ruled out? 
""LEVER""? Double E? 

All have issues? 

Perhaps R at position4? Then pattern: _ E _ R _ 

Example: ""HEART""? But A absent? 
""DEPTH""? D E P T H? T is absent? 
""LEG R?""? 
""YER R?""? 

Word: ""REFER""? But E repeated? 
""SEER?""? But S absent? 

Available letters: D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y? Etc. 

Possible words? 
- ""HEFTY""? F T Y? T absent? Cannot. 
- ""WEARY""? O absent? 
- ""KEBAR""? Uncommon? 
- ""FEWER""? F E W E R? Double E? Position4 R? Position5 R? Wait? ""FEWER""? F E W E R? Position4: E? Which is forbidden? 

Similarly? With E at position4? Not allowed? 

Thus? We need words without E except at2? And without ruled-out letters? 

List of possible word structures? 

Case 1: R at position5: word pattern: ? E ? ? R  
Positions: 1: letter, 3: letter, 4: letter? 
R is at5? So position4 must be a letter? 

Word: letter E letter letter R? 

With letters from available pool? 

Example: ""JEHIR""? Not word? 
""LEVIR""? Not common? 
""PENIR""? Absent? 

Common word: ""DEUCE""? E at3? But we must have E only at2? So position3 here is U? 
""DEUCE"": D E U C E? But C absent? and E repeated? 
Bad? 

""LEECH""? L E E C H? Double E? And C absent? 

""PEYER""? P E Y E R? Double E? And E at4? Forbidden? 

Only possibility? 

But we have ""GIVER""? G I V E R? But I absent? 

Cannot? 

Case 2: R at position4: pattern: ? E ? R ? 
So: position1: letter? position3: letter? position5: letter? 
R at4? 

Example: ""DEARY""? D E A R Y? A absent? 
""HEARD""? H E A R D? A absent? 
""BER T?""? Absent? 

""FEINT""? F E I N T? But I absent? N absent? 
""WEIRD""? W E I R D? I absent? 

""YER K?""? 

Let's think ""LEPER"" but double E? 

Perhaps ""KYDER""? Uncommon? 

""FLIER""? But L? I? absent? 

But F,L, but I absent? 

No ""L""?

How about ""FLYER""? F L Y E R? But position4 is E? R at5? 
""FLYER"": F L Y E R? But that's position1 F, 2 L? 3 Y? 4 E? 5 R? 
But we have E at position4? Which we know is not allowed? Because robes put E at position4 and got '-' meaning E not at position4? 

Similarly? We cannot have E at position4? 

Therefore? Only words with no E except at position2, and R at position4 or position5, but with other letters. 

Another word: ""DEVIL""? D E V I L? But I absent? 
""HEMAL""? M absent? 

I think I missed a possibility? Position5 could be a letter? But not E? 

For R at position4: word: 1: X? 2:E? 3:Y? 4:R? 5:Z? 
 or for R at position5: word: 1:X? 2:E? 3:Y? 4:Z? 5:R? 

With X, Y, Z from available: D,F,G,H,K,L,P,U,V,W,Y? Etc. 

Now, common words? for R at position4: ""UDDER""? No R? 
""UMBER""? U M B E R? M absent? B absent? 

LETTER? L E T T E R? Banned? T absent? and E repeated? Cannot? 

""PUREE""? P U R E E? E at5? And not standard? 

The only common word I can think of is ""LURER""? L U R E R? but E not at2? And E at4? 
""ERROR""? E not at2? 

Not? 

Perhaps we need to consider that R might not be on its own? But it must be? 

Another possibility: ""ERRED""? E R R E D? But we have position1:E? But secret word has E at position2? Cannot have E at1? 

Word must have position2 E? 

So pattern: _ E _ _ _ 

With R at4 or5? 

Let me search? 
- Words: ""DETER""? D E T E R? T absent? E repeated? Bad? 
""HEBER""? H E B E R? B absent? 
""LEGER""? L E G E R? E at4? Forbidden? 
""PAGER""? A absent? 
""SEVER""? S absent? 

Perhaps ""DEUCE"" but C? 

I think we may have ""VE RY?""? 

""VERGE""? V E R G E? E at position2? R at position3? But in ""VERGE"": positions: V E R G E? Position3 R? Position4 G? Position5 E? 
But R at position3? We have already ruled out R at position3? If we use ""VERGE"", but we know R is not at position3? So cannot? 

Similarly? 

Only possibility with R at position5: ""HEDER""? H E D E R? Double E? and E at4? 
""WEDER""? Like? 

But let's think: ""FEMME""? No R? 

Perhaps we should guess a word that has R at position4 or5 and new letters? 

But we have limited letters? 

For example, put R at position4? So pattern: _ E _ R _ 

Then guess: ""GEY ER""? Not? 

""PEERY""? P E E R Y? Double E? And E at position3? 
""PEERY"": P E E R Y? Position1:P, 2:E, 3:E (which we can allow? But if secret word has E at position3, then it's possible? 

But previously? Crane had E at position5? Which was wrong? Robes had E at position4 wrong? Merit had E at position2 correct? So if secret word has E at position3? It is a repeat? 

But we never tested position3 for E? 

In merit? At position3 we guessed R? Not E? So we don't know if there is E at position3? 

Similarly? It's possible? 

But then the secret word would have two E? At positions 2 and 3? 

For example, the secret word could be ""ME E R something""? 

But position3 is E? 

But pattern _ E E something? 

With R at position4 or5? But position4 R? Or not. 

Example: ""GREET""? G R E E T? But R at position2? But we have position2 must be E? So secret word has positions. 

For secret word with two E: at 2 and 3? Then pattern: _ E E _ _ 

But because R must be at4 or5? So "" E E R?""? 

Word: ""LEERs""? L E E R S? But S absent? 
""BEERY""? B absent? 
""JEERY""? J? Uncommon? 
""VEERY""? V E E R Y? 

""VEERY"" is a bird? 

But let's see? Letters: V,E,E,R,Y? Available? V? Not ruled out? E at position3? Y? 

Also, R at position4? 

So possible? 

But we have two E? Position2 and 3? 

Then feedback for merit: we guessed E at position2 correctly? R at position3: if secret word has E at position3? Then we guessed R which is not present at3? But R is in the word? At position4? So merit: position3 should be? If secret word has E at position3? We guessed R at position3? Which is wrong? So it should be not R? But since R is at position4? Then the feedback for position3: R(-) means R is in the word but not at position3? Which is correct? 

Similarly? E at position3 doesn't conflict? 

Therefore? We should consider ""VEERY"" as a candidate? 

But V is not common? 

Or another word: ""LEERY""? L E E R Y? Same as above? With L? 

But S absent? 

""LEERY"": L E E R Y? Letters L,E,E,R,Y? 
Available? L not ruled out? E allowed? R at position4? Y at5? 

Previously ruled out c,a,n,o,b,s,m,i,t? So L? Available? Y? Available? 

So possible? 

Similarly? ""PEERY""? P E E R Y? 

Or ""NEVER""? N absent? 

Among common options? ""LEERY"" might be acceptable? 

Perhaps ""WEARY""? But A absent? And O? 

No? 

So ""VEERY"" or ""LEERY"" etc? 

But we need to guess wisely? 

Since we don t have many letters? Perhaps guess ""LEERY"" if that's the word? 

But let's see other possibilities? 

Without double E? 

For example? ""HEFTY"" not? T absent? 

""KEDGE""? K E D G E? Double E? 
""PUDGE""? P U D G E? Double E? 
 etc? 

So perhaps double E at positions 2 and 3 is common? 

With R at position4? 

So words like ""LEERY"", ""VEERY"", ""BEERY"" (B absent)? 

""DEARY"" D E A R Y? A absent? 
""SEARY"" S absent? 

Therefore? ""LEERY"" is a good candidate? 

Or ""PEERY""? 

But ""LEERY"" more common? 

Now, also R at position5? With E at position2? 

Then word: _ E _ _ R 

With possible double E? Like at position3? So _ E E _ R? 

Example: ""MEET R"" ""MEETR"" not? 
""LEETR"" not? 
""BEERS"" S absent? 

So less common? 

Thus, most likely R at position4? with E at position2 and possibly E at position3? 

But in LEERY? E at position2 and3? 

So possible? 

For the guess? Since we have only a few options? We could guess ""LEERY"" or something covering? 

But let's make a guess that distinguishes? 

For example, if we think there might be E at position3? Then guess a word with E at position3? But to test? 

Since we have only 3 tries left? 

Possible words without double E at position3? But are there any? If R at position5? 

For example: G E K L R? Not word? 
P E V E R? Double E? 

H E L I R? But I absent? 

U E F F R? Not word? 

So very few options? 

Therefore? the word might be one of the double E words? 

So I think ""LEERY"" is a possible word? 

Guess: ""LEERY""

Let's confirm letters: L,E,E,R,Y? 

But E repeated? 

Also feedback? Previous: if we guess ""LEERY"": 
- Position1 L? 
- Position2 E? Should be correct? 
- Position3 E? If secret word has E at position3? Then we get and it's correct? But we don't know? 
- Position4 R? 
- Position5 Y? 

If secret word has ""LEERY"", then feedback will show.

But in our case, the secret word has E at position2? And R must be at4 or5? If secret word has E at position2 and3? Then R at position4? 

So likely? 

Alternatively, if not, we get feedback and deduct? 

But we must avoid ruled-out letters? LEERY uses L,E,E,R,Y? No ruled-out? 

Thus, we guess ""LEERY""

If not, we will know. 

But let's see merit feedback: E(✓) at position2? And R(-) at position3? Meaning R not at3? So if secret has LEERY? Then E at2? Yes? E at3? We didn't guess E at3? So it doesn't show? But position3 in LEERY is E? And we guessed R? Which is not E? So symbol for position3 would be based on R? R is in the word? At position4? So we get '-' for R at3? 

So consistent? 

Therefore, it could be? 

Other words? ""YEVER"" not common? 

So I think ""LEERY"" is a good guess? 

Thus, my next guess is ""leery""

But for spelling: ""leery"" is a valid English word? Meaning wary? 

Yes? 

So guess: ""LEERY""After analyzing the feedback from all guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(absent), R(present-wrong-position), A(absent), N(absent), E(present-wrong-position).  
  This reveals: R and E are in the word, but R is not at position 2, and E is not at position 5. C, A, N are absent.

- **Guess 2: robes** → Feedback: R(present-wrong-position), O(absent), B(absent), E(present-wrong-position), S(absent).  
  This reveals: R is not at position 1, E is not at position 4. O, B, S are absent, and the absence of S is new.

- **Guess 3: merit** → Feedback: M(absent), E(correct-position), R(present-wrong-position), I(absent), T(absent).  
  This reveals: E is fixed at position 2 (secret word pattern: _ E _ _ _). R is not at position 3 (so R must be at position 4 or 5). M, I, T are absent.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters**: R and E.
- **E position**: Fixed at position 2 (secret word pattern: `_ E _ _ _`).
- **R position**: Cannot be at positions 1, 2, or 3 → must be at 4 or 5.
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, O, B, S, M, I, T (10 letters ruled out).
- **Available pool**: D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y (common letters prioritized).
- **Possible word structures**:
  - R at position 4: `_ E _ R _`
  - R at position 5: `_ E _ _ R`
- Considering E may repeat (e.g., at position 3) since previous feedback doesn't rule it out. This fits common words like ""LEERY"" (which introduces multiple new letters).

Given this, **""LEERY""** is an optimal guess:
- Tests R at position 4.
- Introduces high-frequency letters L, Y (both new).
- Position 3 tests for possible E repeat (if present, we get feedback).
- Avoids ruled-out letters and fits E at position 2.",Guess 4: leery -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) E(✓) E(✓) R(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
