We have feedback from the first guess:
Guess: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)

Interpretation:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all (marked with x).
- A is in the secret word but not in the correct position (marked with -).

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter A, but it is not the third letter (since in ""CRANE"", A is the third).
- The letters C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.

Therefore, we must avoid using C, R, N, E in our next guess.

We also know:
- The secret word is a 5-letter word that includes A (but not in position 3) and does not include C, R, N, E.

For our next guess, we need:
- To use only letters that are not C, R, N, E.
- To include the letter A, but not in the third position.
- Also, it's good to use other common letters to maximize information.

Common English letters: We can consider letters like S, T, O, L, I, B, P, M, H, etc.

We should avoid positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 having A? Actually, the feedback says A is in the word but not in position 3. So A must be in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5? Actually, no: positions are 1 to 5. In the guess CRANE, the third letter was A and it's marked as present but wrong position. That means in the secret word, A is present but not in the third position. So A must be in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5? No, wait: the feedback only tells us that A is not in position 3. It could be in any other position (1, 2, 4, or 5) or possibly even repeated? But since we know the secret word has one A? Actually, we don't know if there are multiple A's. The feedback only tells us that at least one A is present and not in position 3.

But note: our guess had only one A. If the secret word had two A's, then we might have gotten more information? But in this feedback, we only see A marked as '-' meaning one occurrence (but wrong position) because if there were two A's, and one of them was in another position, we might get another '-' for that position? But the rules don't specify that Wordle shows all occurrences. Actually, the rules of Wordle (as per the example) show:
- For each letter, independently, if it's in the word and in the correct position: ✓
- If it's in the word but not that position: -
- If not: x

And if there are duplicate letters, it can get complex. But since our guess had one A, we know that there is at least one A in the secret word and it is not in position 3.

So, for our next guess, we should include A in a position that is not 3, and avoid letters C, R, N, E.

Let me think of words that have A and are made up of letters from the remaining alphabet.

List of available letters: without C, R, N, E.

We can try a word with A in position 1? Or position 2, 4, or 5.

Common starting letters: We can try words that start with T, S, L, etc.

Since we have A present, let's put A in a different position to test.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

We should also cover other common letters.

A good candidate: ""SALET"" but S, A, L, E, T ... but E is disallowed (we know E is not in the word) so avoid E.

We cannot use E.

Another option: ""TAPIR"" but has R (disallowed).

Avoid R.

What about ""STOMP"" — no A? But we must include A because we know A is in the word, so we should include A to get more information about its position.

We must include A in the next guess? Actually, we don't have to, but it's advisable because we only have one known letter. Otherwise we might waste a guess.

So let's look for words that include A and avoid C, R, N, E.

Options: 
- A in position 1: e.g., A_ _ _ _  (avoid R, N, E, C) 
  - Words: ABYSS, ABBOT, AWAIT, AWAKE (but E is disallowed), AWARD (has R), AWAIT has T? We can use T.

But we have to form a real word.

Let me think: ""AUDIO"" - but U is less common? Also, D, O, I are available.

But let's check: A, U, D, I, O. None of these are C, R, N, E. But note: we don't know if they are in the word or not.

Another word: ""AISLE"" - but has E and it's disallowed.

We must avoid E.

So, how about ""ALOFT"": A, L, O, F, T.

Positions: A in 1, but in our feedback, A was in position 3 in CRANE and got '-'. Now we are trying A in position 1. And we avoid R, N, E, C.

""ALOFT"" consists of A, L, O, F, T.

This seems valid.

Another option: ""ADIEU"" but has E and D? But E is disallowed.

Alternative: ""ABOUT"" - A, B, O, U, T -> has O, U, T which are not forbidden, and B is common.

But note: we don't have any information about B, O, U, T.

Would ""ABOUT"" be a good word? It has A in position 1.

But in CRANE, position 3 was A and it was present but wrong. So if the secret word has A in position 1, then in our next guess putting A in position 1 might get a ✓.

Similarly, we can try A in other positions.

Another word: ""PLANT"" but has N? Disallowed.

So no N.

Let me list a few words:
- ""SAUCE"" has C? Disallowed.
- ""SAULT"" ... but not common? Actually ""SALT"" is not 5 letters.

How about ""SALAD"": S, A, L, A, D — but that's two A's? And we might not know if the word has two A's.

But it uses A twice and we avoid duplicates? Actually, including duplicate letters when we don't know about the frequency might not be optimal.

So avoid duplicates for now.

""SOLAR"" has R? Disallowed.

""MANGA"" has M, A, N, G, A? But N is disallowed.

So ""MANGA"" is invalid because N is disallowed.

Another idea: ""PASTA"" — P, A, S, T, A? Two A's? Or ""PASTE"" has E.

""PASTY"" — P, A, S, T, Y? But Y is less common? And it has A at position 2. And letters: P, A, S, T, Y.

Avoiding C, R, N, E.

So ""PASTY"" could be an option.

But maybe better to cover more common letters? Like T, S, L, O, etc.

Another word: ""TOAST"" has T, O, A, S, T? Two T's? Also, T is repeated.

We can try ""STAID"": S, T, A, I, D.

Letters: S, T, A, I, D — all not forbidden? And A in position 3? But we know from feedback that A is not in position 3? Because in CRANE, A was in position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it exists but not in position 3. So if we put A again in position 3, we'll definitely get a '-' again? Because it's not the correct position? But if we put it elsewhere, we can test other positions.

So putting A in position 3 again is not efficient because we already know it's not there.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should put A in a different position: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

So for ""ALOFT"": A in position 1 (new position).
For ""PASTY"": A in position 2.

Also, consider ""ASHED"" but H, E, D? But E is disallowed.

""ASHEN"" has E and N? Disallowed.

""AVAIL"": A, V, A, I, L? Two A's? But V is not very common.

Maybe ""RAYON"" has R? Disallowed.

I think ""ALOFT"" is acceptable.

But let me confirm: ""ALOFT"" -> A in 1, then L, O, F, T.

Alternatively, ""ALTER"" has E and R? Disallowed.

""ADMIT"" — A, D, M, I, T? A in position 1? And D, M, I, T not used yet.

But we have position 1: A. If we try position 1 A and it's not in the secret word, then we get x for A? But that contradicts previous feedback? Because we know A is in the word. So if the secret word has A and we put A in position 1, then either:
- If the secret word has A in position 1: we get ✓ for position 1.
- If the secret word has A but not in position 1: we get - for position 1.

Which is new information.

Similarly, for any other position.

So let's go with ""ALOFT"".

But we can also consider including more vowels? But we already have A and O.

Other options: ""ABOIL"" — not common.

I think ""ALOFT"" is a reasonable choice.

But note: are there any other constraints? We have 5 positions. Our word: ALOFT.

Alternatively, we could choose ""PAINT"" but has N? Disallowed.

""BLACK"" has C? Disallowed.

So ""ALOFT"" seems a valid word without banned letters.

Another option: ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2? But D and Y are not very common? And we don't know.

""OASIS"" — O in front? Has two S? And A in position 2? But ""OASIS"" has S repeated? And it ends with S which might not be best? But legit.

But I think ""ALOFT"" is better.

Let me consider: We might choose a word that has multiple common letters and includes A not in position 3.

Another word: ""TABBY"" — T, A, B, B, Y? Two B's? Not great.

""TAFFY"" — T, A, F, F, Y? Two F's.

So duplicates might be avoided.

Therefore, I choose ""ALOFT"".

But wait: we need to use unique letters to maximize coverage.

In ""ALOFT"": A, L, O, F, T — all unique letters? Yes.

Therefore, it's efficient.

So our second guess: ""ALOFT"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" with feedback C(not present), R(not present), A(present but wrong position), N(not present), E(not present), we know:

- The secret word contains the letter ""A"", but it is not in the third position (since it appeared in position 3 of ""CRANE"" and was marked with '-').
- The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all (marked with 'x').
- The next guess must be a 5-letter word that includes ""A"" (but not in position 3) and avoids using C, R, N, E.

To gather more information about the position of ""A"" and other potential letters, a good second guess should:
- Place ""A"" in a different position (position 1, 2, 4, or 5) to test for correctness or presence.
- Use common English letters not yet ruled out (avoiding C, R, N, E).
- Prefer unique letters to maximize coverage.

The word ""ALOFT"" fits these criteria:
- It includes ""A"" in position 1 (a new position to check).
- It uses other common letters: L, O, F, T (all not yet tested).
- Each letter is unique, providing additional information about multiple letters.
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help determine if ""A"" is in position 1, and provide feedback on L, O, F, T.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,datum,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess:
Guess: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)

Interpretation:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all (marked with x).
- A is in the secret word but not in the correct position (marked with -).

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter A, but it is not the third letter (since in ""CRANE"", A is the third).
- The letters C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.

Therefore, we must avoid using C, R, N, E in our next guess.

We also know:
- The secret word is a 5-letter word that includes A (but not in position 3) and does not include C, R, N, E.

For our next guess, we need:
- To use only letters that are not C, R, N, E.
- To include the letter A, but not in the third position.
- Also, it's good to use other common letters to maximize information.

Common English letters: We can consider letters like S, T, O, L, I, B, P, M, H, etc.

We should avoid positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 having A? Actually, the feedback says A is in the word but not in position 3. So A must be in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5? Actually, no: positions are 1 to 5. In the guess CRANE, the third letter was A and it's marked as present but wrong position. That means in the secret word, A is present but not in the third position. So A must be in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5? No, wait: the feedback only tells us that A is not in position 3. It could be in any other position (1, 2, 4, or 5) or possibly even repeated? But since we know the secret word has one A? Actually, we don't know if there are multiple A's. The feedback only tells us that at least one A is present and not in position 3.

But note: our guess had only one A. If the secret word had two A's, then we might have gotten more information? But in this feedback, we only see A marked as '-' meaning one occurrence (but wrong position) because if there were two A's, and one of them was in another position, we might get another '-' for that position? But the rules don't specify that Wordle shows all occurrences. Actually, the rules of Wordle (as per the example) show:
- For each letter, independently, if it's in the word and in the correct position: ✓
- If it's in the word but not that position: -
- If not: x

And if there are duplicate letters, it can get complex. But since our guess had one A, we know that there is at least one A in the secret word and it is not in position 3.

So, for our next guess, we should include A in a position that is not 3, and avoid letters C, R, N, E.

Let me think of words that have A and are made up of letters from the remaining alphabet.

List of available letters: without C, R, N, E.

We can try a word with A in position 1? Or position 2, 4, or 5.

Common starting letters: We can try words that start with T, S, L, etc.

Since we have A present, let's put A in a different position to test.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

We should also cover other common letters.

A good candidate: ""SALET"" but S, A, L, E, T ... but E is disallowed (we know E is not in the word) so avoid E.

We cannot use E.

Another option: ""TAPIR"" but has R (disallowed).

Avoid R.

What about ""STOMP"" — no A? But we must include A because we know A is in the word, so we should include A to get more information about its position.

We must include A in the next guess? Actually, we don't have to, but it's advisable because we only have one known letter. Otherwise we might waste a guess.

So let's look for words that include A and avoid C, R, N, E.

Options: 
- A in position 1: e.g., A_ _ _ _  (avoid R, N, E, C) 
  - Words: ABYSS, ABBOT, AWAIT, AWAKE (but E is disallowed), AWARD (has R), AWAIT has T? We can use T.

But we have to form a real word.

Let me think: ""AUDIO"" - but U is less common? Also, D, O, I are available.

But let's check: A, U, D, I, O. None of these are C, R, N, E. But note: we don't know if they are in the word or not.

Another word: ""AISLE"" - but has E and it's disallowed.

We must avoid E.

So, how about ""ALOFT"": A, L, O, F, T.

Positions: A in 1, but in our feedback, A was in position 3 in CRANE and got '-'. Now we are trying A in position 1. And we avoid R, N, E, C.

""ALOFT"" consists of A, L, O, F, T.

This seems valid.

Another option: ""ADIEU"" but has E and D? But E is disallowed.

Alternative: ""ABOUT"" - A, B, O, U, T -> has O, U, T which are not forbidden, and B is common.

But note: we don't have any information about B, O, U, T.

Would ""ABOUT"" be a good word? It has A in position 1.

But in CRANE, position 3 was A and it was present but wrong. So if the secret word has A in position 1, then in our next guess putting A in position 1 might get a ✓.

Similarly, we can try A in other positions.

Another word: ""PLANT"" but has N? Disallowed.

So no N.

Let me list a few words:
- ""SAUCE"" has C? Disallowed.
- ""SAULT"" ... but not common? Actually ""SALT"" is not 5 letters.

How about ""SALAD"": S, A, L, A, D — but that's two A's? And we might not know if the word has two A's.

But it uses A twice and we avoid duplicates? Actually, including duplicate letters when we don't know about the frequency might not be optimal.

So avoid duplicates for now.

""SOLAR"" has R? Disallowed.

""MANGA"" has M, A, N, G, A? But N is disallowed.

So ""MANGA"" is invalid because N is disallowed.

Another idea: ""PASTA"" — P, A, S, T, A? Two A's? Or ""PASTE"" has E.

""PASTY"" — P, A, S, T, Y? But Y is less common? And it has A at position 2. And letters: P, A, S, T, Y.

Avoiding C, R, N, E.

So ""PASTY"" could be an option.

But maybe better to cover more common letters? Like T, S, L, O, etc.

Another word: ""TOAST"" has T, O, A, S, T? Two T's? Also, T is repeated.

We can try ""STAID"": S, T, A, I, D.

Letters: S, T, A, I, D — all not forbidden? And A in position 3? But we know from feedback that A is not in position 3? Because in CRANE, A was in position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it exists but not in position 3. So if we put A again in position 3, we'll definitely get a '-' again? Because it's not the correct position? But if we put it elsewhere, we can test other positions.

So putting A in position 3 again is not efficient because we already know it's not there.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should put A in a different position: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

So for ""ALOFT"": A in position 1 (new position).
For ""PASTY"": A in position 2.

Also, consider ""ASHED"" but H, E, D? But E is disallowed.

""ASHEN"" has E and N? Disallowed.

""AVAIL"": A, V, A, I, L? Two A's? But V is not very common.

Maybe ""RAYON"" has R? Disallowed.

I think ""ALOFT"" is acceptable.

But let me confirm: ""ALOFT"" -> A in 1, then L, O, F, T.

Alternatively, ""ALTER"" has E and R? Disallowed.

""ADMIT"" — A, D, M, I, T? A in position 1? And D, M, I, T not used yet.

But we have position 1: A. If we try position 1 A and it's not in the secret word, then we get x for A? But that contradicts previous feedback? Because we know A is in the word. So if the secret word has A and we put A in position 1, then either:
- If the secret word has A in position 1: we get ✓ for position 1.
- If the secret word has A but not in position 1: we get - for position 1.

Which is new information.

Similarly, for any other position.

So let's go with ""ALOFT"".

But we can also consider including more vowels? But we already have A and O.

Other options: ""ABOIL"" — not common.

I think ""ALOFT"" is a reasonable choice.

But note: are there any other constraints? We have 5 positions. Our word: ALOFT.

Alternatively, we could choose ""PAINT"" but has N? Disallowed.

""BLACK"" has C? Disallowed.

So ""ALOFT"" seems a valid word without banned letters.

Another option: ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2? But D and Y are not very common? And we don't know.

""OASIS"" — O in front? Has two S? And A in position 2? But ""OASIS"" has S repeated? And it ends with S which might not be best? But legit.

But I think ""ALOFT"" is better.

Let me consider: We might choose a word that has multiple common letters and includes A not in position 3.

Another word: ""TABBY"" — T, A, B, B, Y? Two B's? Not great.

""TAFFY"" — T, A, F, F, Y? Two F's.

So duplicates might be avoided.

Therefore, I choose ""ALOFT"".

But wait: we need to use unique letters to maximize coverage.

In ""ALOFT"": A, L, O, F, T — all unique letters? Yes.

Therefore, it's efficient.

So our second guess: ""ALOFT"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" with feedback C(not present), R(not present), A(present but wrong position), N(not present), E(not present), we know:

- The secret word contains the letter ""A"", but it is not in the third position (since it appeared in position 3 of ""CRANE"" and was marked with '-').
- The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all (marked with 'x').
- The next guess must be a 5-letter word that includes ""A"" (but not in position 3) and avoids using C, R, N, E.

To gather more information about the position of ""A"" and other potential letters, a good second guess should:
- Place ""A"" in a different position (position 1, 2, 4, or 5) to test for correctness or presence.
- Use common English letters not yet ruled out (avoiding C, R, N, E).
- Prefer unique letters to maximize coverage.

The word ""ALOFT"" fits these criteria:
- It includes ""A"" in position 1 (a new position to check).
- It uses other common letters: L, O, F, T (all not yet tested).
- Each letter is unique, providing additional information about multiple letters.
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help determine if ""A"" is in position 1, and provide feedback on L, O, F, T.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

Guess 2: ALOFT -> A(-) L(x) O(x) F(x) T(-)
Meaning:
- A is still not in position 1 (since we got '-' for A in position 1).
- L, O, F are not in the word at all (x).
- T is in the word but not in position 5 (since in ALOFT, T is in position 5 and got '-').

So now we know:
- The secret word contains A and T, but we don't know their positions yet.
- A is not in position 1 or 3 (from guesses 1 and 2).
- T is not in position 5 (from guess 2).
- The absent letters are: C, R, N, E, L, O, F.

Therefore, the available letters are all letters except: C, R, N, E, L, O, F.

We also know the word must have A and T.

Now, positions for A: since not 1 or 3, it must be in 2, 4, or 5.
Positions for T: not 5, so it must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But note: we don't know if there are multiple occurrences of any letter, but so far we have only one A and one T indicated.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Includes both A and T (since we know they are in the word).
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, N, E, L, O, F.
- Tries to place A in a new position (2, 4, or 5) and T in a position that is not 5 (so 1,2,3,4) but we can test a new position for T as well.

We also want to cover other common letters that haven't been tested.

What letters have not been tested? From the alphabet, we have used: C, R, A, N, E, L, O, F, T.

So unused common letters: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common ones: S, T (we know is present), A (present), then B, D, G, H, I, K, M, P, S, U, W, Y.

But T and A are already known, so we should use them and add new letters.

We can try to put A in position 2 or 4 or 5, and T in position 1,2,3, or 4 (but not 5).

Let's think of words that fit.

First, since T is not in 5, we can try T in position 1? Or position 2, etc.

Also, A in position 2,4, or 5.

Possible words:

- If we put T in position 1: then the word starts with T, and A is somewhere in 2,4,5.

  Examples: ""TAPIR"" but R is absent -> invalid.
  ""TAXIS"" but has X and S? And A in position 2? But we can try. However, we have to avoid absent letters: R is absent, but TAXIS has no R? T,A,X,I,S. None of these are in the absent list? Absent: C,R,N,E,L,O,F. So T,A,X,I,S are allowed.

  But ""TAXIS"" has two S? Actually, TAXIS is T-A-X-I-S, so no duplicate? T,A,X,I,S are all distinct? Yes.

  But is ""TAXIS"" a valid word? Yes.

  However, we have A in position 2. We know A is not in 1 or 3, but position 2 is possible.

  Alternatively, ""TAMIS"" — not common? Or ""TABIS"" — not sure.

  ""TAPAS"" — but has P and A twice? T,A,P,A,S — two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. It might.

  But to avoid complexity, let's try without duplicates if possible.

  ""TASKS"" — has two S's? T,A,S,K,S — duplicate S.

  ""TAKIS"" — not common.

  So ""TAXIS"" might be acceptable.

- If we put T in position 2: then the word has T in second position, and A in 4 or 5? Because position 2 is taken by T, so A must be in 4 or 5.

  Example: ""STAMP"" but S,T,A,M,P. But S is allowed? And T in position 2? But we have to avoid S? No, S is not in the absent list. Absent: C,R,N,E,L,O,F. So S is allowed.

  ""STAMP"": S in 1, T in 2, A in 3? But we know A is not in position 3! From the first guess. So we cannot put A in position 3.

  Therefore, if T is in position 2, then A must be in 4 or 5.

  So for example: ""UTICA"" but U,T,I,C,A — C is absent! Invalid.

  ""PTARM"" — not a word.

  ""STACK"" has C? Disallowed.

  ""STAGE"" has E? Disallowed.

  ""STAID"" — S,T,A,I,D. But A is in position 3? But position 3 is not allowed for A. So invalid.

  We need A in 4 or 5 when T is in 2.

  Example: ""BATTS"" — B,A,T,T,S? Duplicate T and A in position 2? But we are putting T in position 2? Let's define: if we have T in position 2, then the word is _ T _ _ _

  Then A must be in 4 or 5: so _ T _ A _ or _ T _ _ A

  Examples: ""UTAAT"" not a word.

  ""STAFF"" has F? F is absent (from guess 2, F is x). So invalid.

  ""STACK"" has C? Invalid.

  ""STAIN"" has N? Invalid.

  Hard to find.

  ""STOMP"" has O? O is absent.

  So maybe not many options with T in 2.

- T in position 3: then word is _ _ T _ _

  And A must be in 2,4,5? But position 2: then _ A T _ _ 
  Or position 4: _ _ T A _
  Or position 5: _ _ T _ A

  But we know T is in the word, and we are putting it in position 3. But we don't know if position 3 is correct.

  Example: ""GATOR"" has R? Disallowed.

  ""HATSY"" — H,A,T,S,Y? A in position 2? And T in 3? But we have to avoid absent letters: H,A,T,S,Y are all allowed? Absent: C,R,N,E,L,O,F. So yes.

  But ""HATSY"" might not be a word. ""HATSY"" is not standard.

  ""MATHS"" — M,A,T,H,S? A in position 2, T in 3? And S at the end. But ""MATHS"" is a word.

  But we have A in position 2? We haven't tested position 2 for A yet.

  Similarly, ""PATHS"" — P,A,T,H,S.

  Both are valid.

- T in position 4: then word is _ _ _ T _

  And A must be in 2 or 5? (since not 1,3, and 4 is T, so 2 or 5)

  Example: ""BAITH"" not common. ""WAIST"" has S? But A in position 2? ""WAIST"" is W,A,I,S,T. So A in 2, T in 5? But T is in position 5? But we know T is not in position 5 from guess 2? In guess 2, T was in position 5 and got '-', so T is not in position 5. Therefore, we cannot put T in position 5? But here we are putting T in position 4, and A in 2 or 5.

  For ""WAIST"": positions: W1, A2, I3, S4, T5. But T is in position 5, which we know is wrong. So if we use ""WAIST"", we would be putting T in position 5 again, which we already know is incorrect. So that would be wasteful.

  We should avoid putting T in position 5 because we know it's not there.

  So for T in position 4: the word is _ _ _ T _

  And A in 2 or 5: so _ A _ T _ or _ _ _ T A

  Example: ""PASTA"" but has P,A,S,T,A? Duplicate A? And S. But A in position 2 and 5? But we don't know about multiple A's. Also, ""PASTA"" has A in 2 and 5, and T in 4.

  But we avoid E, etc. P,A,S,T,A — S is allowed, P is allowed.

  But duplicate A.

  ""MASTS"" has duplicate S and T? M,A,S,T,S — not good.

  ""YEAST"" has E? Disallowed.

  So hard to find.

Given the above, let's go back to the first option: T in position 1.

We can try ""TAXIS"": T in 1, A in 2, X in 3, I in 4, S in 5.

But we know A is not in position 3? We don't know about position 2. In this case, A is in position 2, which is a new position.

Also, we are testing X and I and S.

But X is not very common, so it might not be efficient.

Another word with T in 1 and A in 4 or 5?

For example, T in 1 and A in 4: T _ _ A _

With available letters: T, ?, ?, A, ?

Avoiding C,R,N,E,L,O,F.

Possible: ""TUBAS"" — T,U,B,A,S? A in 4? Positions: T1, U2, B3, A4, S5. So A in 4, which is new.

""TUBAS"" is a word.

Similarly, ""TUPIK"" — not common.

""TAMAS"" — T,A,M,A,S? Duplicate A? T1, A2, M3, A4, S5. But A in 2 and 4? We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's multiple.

But we are testing position 2 and 4 for A.

But we already know A is not in 1 or 3, so 2 and 4 are possible.

But in ""TUBAS"", we have A only once, in position 4.

Similarly, T in 1 and A in 5: T _ _ _ A

Example: ""TIPSY"" but no A? ""TIPSY"" is T,I,P,S,Y — no A.

""TODAY"" has O? Disallowed.

""TAPAS"" has A in 2 and 5? T1, A2, P3, A4, S5? But A in 2 and 5? And P and S.

But duplicate A.

""TANKA"" has N? Disallowed.

So ""TUBAS"" seems better: T,U,B,A,S.

All letters distinct, and we test U, B, S as well.

But we have S at the end.

Another option: ""TAPIS"" — T,A,P,I,S? But A in position 2? And we are testing position 2 for A.

""TAPIS"" is a word.

But then we have A in 2, which is new.

We can also consider putting A in position 5? But we have T in 1, then A in 5: T _ _ _ A

Words: ""TABLA"" — T,A,B,L,A? Duplicate A and L is absent? L is absent, so invalid.

""TUBA"" is 4 letters.

""TARGA"" has R? Disallowed.

So hard.

Therefore, let's consider the option with T in position 3? Like ""PATHS"" or ""MATHS"".

""PATHS"": P1, A2, T3, H4, S5.

But we know T is not in position 5? In this word, T is in position 3, not 5. And A is in position 2, which is new.

Also, we avoid absent letters: P, A, T, H, S — all not in the absent list (C,R,N,E,L,O,F).

So ""PATHS"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""MATHS"": M,A,T,H,S.

Both are good.

But note: in ""PATHS"", we have A in position 2 and T in position 3.

We know from guess 1 that A is not in position 3, but position 2 is untested.

Similarly, T in position 3 is untested.

Also, we get to test P, H, S (or M, H, S for ""MATHS"").

Which one to choose? Both are similar.

""PATHS"" might be more common? Or ""MATHS"".

But let's choose ""PATHS"".

Another word: ""BATHS"" — B,A,T,H,S. Also good.

But we can choose any.

I think ""PATHS"" is fine.

But we have to be cautious: if the secret word has A in position 2, then in ""PATHS"" we might get A correct? Or if not, then we know it's not position 2.

Similarly for T in position 3.

Also, we are testing H and S.

S is a very common letter, so good to test.

So let's go with ""PATHS"".

But wait: in the feedback, we have T marked as present but not in position 5. We don't know about position 3.

So ""PATHS"" seems a good choice.

Alternatively, we could put A in position 4 or 5.

For example, with T in 1: ""TUBAS"" has A in position 4.

""TUBAS"": T1, U2, B3, A4, S5.

A in position 4, which is new.

But we are testing U and B, which are less common than P and H? P and H are more common.

In ""PATHS"", we test P, A (position 2), T (position 3), H, S.

We know A is in the word, so we are focusing on its position.

Similarly, T is in the word, so we are testing its position.

Therefore, I think ""PATHS"" is a solid choice.

So our third guess: ""PATHS"".

But let's confirm the letters: P, A, T, H, S.

None of these are in the absent list: absent are C,R,N,E,L,O,F.

Yes.

So <guess>paths</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, R, N, E are absent (x), and A is present but not in position 3 (-).
- **Guess 2 (ALOFT)**: A is present but not in position 1 (-), L, O, F are absent (x), and T is present but not in position 5 (-).

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: A and T are present, but their positions are unknown.
- **A's possible positions**: Not 1 or 3 (from Guess 1 and 2), so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- **T's possible positions**: Not 5 (from Guess 2), so it must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, L, O, F (cannot be used).
- **Goal for next guess**: Test new positions for A (2, 4, or 5) and T (1, 2, 3, or 4), while covering other common unused letters (e.g., S, P, H, I, D, M).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include A and T**: Since both are confirmed present, we must use them to gather positional information.
- **Test A in position 2**: This position hasn't been tested yet (previously tested positions 1 and 3 were incorrect).
- **Test T in position 3**: This position hasn't been tested (previously tested position 5 was incorrect).
- **Use new common letters**: Add P, H, and S to maximize information (S is highly common; P and H are also frequent).
- **Avoid duplicates and absent letters**: All letters in the guess should be unique and not from the absent list.

The word **""PATHS""** fits perfectly:
- P (position 1), A (position 2), T (position 3), H (position 4), S (position 5).
- A is tested in position 2 (new position).
- T is tested in position 3 (new position).
- Covers P, H, and S (untested common letters).
- All letters are distinct and not absent.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of A and T while checking for the presence of P, H, and S.

<guess>paths</guess>",paths,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

Guess 2: ALOFT -> A(-) L(x) O(x) F(x) T(-)
Meaning:
- A is still not in position 1 (since we got '-' for A in position 1).
- L, O, F are not in the word at all (x).
- T is in the word but not in position 5 (since in ALOFT, T is in position 5 and got '-').

So now we know:
- The secret word contains A and T, but we don't know their positions yet.
- A is not in position 1 or 3 (from guesses 1 and 2).
- T is not in position 5 (from guess 2).
- The absent letters are: C, R, N, E, L, O, F.

Therefore, the available letters are all letters except: C, R, N, E, L, O, F.

We also know the word must have A and T.

Now, positions for A: since not 1 or 3, it must be in 2, 4, or 5.
Positions for T: not 5, so it must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But note: we don't know if there are multiple occurrences of any letter, but so far we have only one A and one T indicated.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Includes both A and T (since we know they are in the word).
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, N, E, L, O, F.
- Tries to place A in a new position (2, 4, or 5) and T in a position that is not 5 (so 1,2,3,4) but we can test a new position for T as well.

We also want to cover other common letters that haven't been tested.

What letters have not been tested? From the alphabet, we have used: C, R, A, N, E, L, O, F, T.

So unused common letters: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common ones: S, T (we know is present), A (present), then B, D, G, H, I, K, M, P, S, U, W, Y.

But T and A are already known, so we should use them and add new letters.

We can try to put A in position 2 or 4 or 5, and T in position 1,2,3, or 4 (but not 5).

Let's think of words that fit.

First, since T is not in 5, we can try T in position 1? Or position 2, etc.

Also, A in position 2,4, or 5.

Possible words:

- If we put T in position 1: then the word starts with T, and A is somewhere in 2,4,5.

  Examples: ""TAPIR"" but R is absent -> invalid.
  ""TAXIS"" but has X and S? And A in position 2? But we can try. However, we have to avoid absent letters: R is absent, but TAXIS has no R? T,A,X,I,S. None of these are in the absent list? Absent: C,R,N,E,L,O,F. So T,A,X,I,S are allowed.

  But ""TAXIS"" has two S? Actually, TAXIS is T-A-X-I-S, so no duplicate? T,A,X,I,S are all distinct? Yes.

  But is ""TAXIS"" a valid word? Yes.

  However, we have A in position 2. We know A is not in 1 or 3, but position 2 is possible.

  Alternatively, ""TAMIS"" — not common? Or ""TABIS"" — not sure.

  ""TAPAS"" — but has P and A twice? T,A,P,A,S — two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. It might.

  But to avoid complexity, let's try without duplicates if possible.

  ""TASKS"" — has two S's? T,A,S,K,S — duplicate S.

  ""TAKIS"" — not common.

  So ""TAXIS"" might be acceptable.

- If we put T in position 2: then the word has T in second position, and A in 4 or 5? Because position 2 is taken by T, so A must be in 4 or 5.

  Example: ""STAMP"" but S,T,A,M,P. But S is allowed? And T in position 2? But we have to avoid S? No, S is not in the absent list. Absent: C,R,N,E,L,O,F. So S is allowed.

  ""STAMP"": S in 1, T in 2, A in 3? But we know A is not in position 3! From the first guess. So we cannot put A in position 3.

  Therefore, if T is in position 2, then A must be in 4 or 5.

  So for example: ""UTICA"" but U,T,I,C,A — C is absent! Invalid.

  ""PTARM"" — not a word.

  ""STACK"" has C? Disallowed.

  ""STAGE"" has E? Disallowed.

  ""STAID"" — S,T,A,I,D. But A is in position 3? But position 3 is not allowed for A. So invalid.

  We need A in 4 or 5 when T is in 2.

  Example: ""BATTS"" — B,A,T,T,S? Duplicate T and A in position 2? But we are putting T in position 2? Let's define: if we have T in position 2, then the word is _ T _ _ _

  Then A must be in 4 or 5: so _ T _ A _ or _ T _ _ A

  Examples: ""UTAAT"" not a word.

  ""STAFF"" has F? F is absent (from guess 2, F is x). So invalid.

  ""STACK"" has C? Invalid.

  ""STAIN"" has N? Invalid.

  Hard to find.

  ""STOMP"" has O? O is absent.

  So maybe not many options with T in 2.

- T in position 3: then word is _ _ T _ _

  And A must be in 2,4,5? But position 2: then _ A T _ _ 
  Or position 4: _ _ T A _
  Or position 5: _ _ T _ A

  But we know T is in the word, and we are putting it in position 3. But we don't know if position 3 is correct.

  Example: ""GATOR"" has R? Disallowed.

  ""HATSY"" — H,A,T,S,Y? A in position 2? And T in 3? But we have to avoid absent letters: H,A,T,S,Y are all allowed? Absent: C,R,N,E,L,O,F. So yes.

  But ""HATSY"" might not be a word. ""HATSY"" is not standard.

  ""MATHS"" — M,A,T,H,S? A in position 2, T in 3? And S at the end. But ""MATHS"" is a word.

  But we have A in position 2? We haven't tested position 2 for A yet.

  Similarly, ""PATHS"" — P,A,T,H,S.

  Both are valid.

- T in position 4: then word is _ _ _ T _

  And A must be in 2 or 5? (since not 1,3, and 4 is T, so 2 or 5)

  Example: ""BAITH"" not common. ""WAIST"" has S? But A in position 2? ""WAIST"" is W,A,I,S,T. So A in 2, T in 5? But T is in position 5? But we know T is not in position 5 from guess 2? In guess 2, T was in position 5 and got '-', so T is not in position 5. Therefore, we cannot put T in position 5? But here we are putting T in position 4, and A in 2 or 5.

  For ""WAIST"": positions: W1, A2, I3, S4, T5. But T is in position 5, which we know is wrong. So if we use ""WAIST"", we would be putting T in position 5 again, which we already know is incorrect. So that would be wasteful.

  We should avoid putting T in position 5 because we know it's not there.

  So for T in position 4: the word is _ _ _ T _

  And A in 2 or 5: so _ A _ T _ or _ _ _ T A

  Example: ""PASTA"" but has P,A,S,T,A? Duplicate A? And S. But A in position 2 and 5? But we don't know about multiple A's. Also, ""PASTA"" has A in 2 and 5, and T in 4.

  But we avoid E, etc. P,A,S,T,A — S is allowed, P is allowed.

  But duplicate A.

  ""MASTS"" has duplicate S and T? M,A,S,T,S — not good.

  ""YEAST"" has E? Disallowed.

  So hard to find.

Given the above, let's go back to the first option: T in position 1.

We can try ""TAXIS"": T in 1, A in 2, X in 3, I in 4, S in 5.

But we know A is not in position 3? We don't know about position 2. In this case, A is in position 2, which is a new position.

Also, we are testing X and I and S.

But X is not very common, so it might not be efficient.

Another word with T in 1 and A in 4 or 5?

For example, T in 1 and A in 4: T _ _ A _

With available letters: T, ?, ?, A, ?

Avoiding C,R,N,E,L,O,F.

Possible: ""TUBAS"" — T,U,B,A,S? A in 4? Positions: T1, U2, B3, A4, S5. So A in 4, which is new.

""TUBAS"" is a word.

Similarly, ""TUPIK"" — not common.

""TAMAS"" — T,A,M,A,S? Duplicate A? T1, A2, M3, A4, S5. But A in 2 and 4? We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's multiple.

But we are testing position 2 and 4 for A.

But we already know A is not in 1 or 3, so 2 and 4 are possible.

But in ""TUBAS"", we have A only once, in position 4.

Similarly, T in 1 and A in 5: T _ _ _ A

Example: ""TIPSY"" but no A? ""TIPSY"" is T,I,P,S,Y — no A.

""TODAY"" has O? Disallowed.

""TAPAS"" has A in 2 and 5? T1, A2, P3, A4, S5? But A in 2 and 5? And P and S.

But duplicate A.

""TANKA"" has N? Disallowed.

So ""TUBAS"" seems better: T,U,B,A,S.

All letters distinct, and we test U, B, S as well.

But we have S at the end.

Another option: ""TAPIS"" — T,A,P,I,S? But A in position 2? And we are testing position 2 for A.

""TAPIS"" is a word.

But then we have A in 2, which is new.

We can also consider putting A in position 5? But we have T in 1, then A in 5: T _ _ _ A

Words: ""TABLA"" — T,A,B,L,A? Duplicate A and L is absent? L is absent, so invalid.

""TUBA"" is 4 letters.

""TARGA"" has R? Disallowed.

So hard.

Therefore, let's consider the option with T in position 3? Like ""PATHS"" or ""MATHS"".

""PATHS"": P1, A2, T3, H4, S5.

But we know T is not in position 5? In this word, T is in position 3, not 5. And A is in position 2, which is new.

Also, we avoid absent letters: P, A, T, H, S — all not in the absent list (C,R,N,E,L,O,F).

So ""PATHS"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""MATHS"": M,A,T,H,S.

Both are good.

But note: in ""PATHS"", we have A in position 2 and T in position 3.

We know from guess 1 that A is not in position 3, but position 2 is untested.

Similarly, T in position 3 is untested.

Also, we get to test P, H, S (or M, H, S for ""MATHS"").

Which one to choose? Both are similar.

""PATHS"" might be more common? Or ""MATHS"".

But let's choose ""PATHS"".

Another word: ""BATHS"" — B,A,T,H,S. Also good.

But we can choose any.

I think ""PATHS"" is fine.

But we have to be cautious: if the secret word has A in position 2, then in ""PATHS"" we might get A correct? Or if not, then we know it's not position 2.

Similarly for T in position 3.

Also, we are testing H and S.

S is a very common letter, so good to test.

So let's go with ""PATHS"".

But wait: in the feedback, we have T marked as present but not in position 5. We don't know about position 3.

So ""PATHS"" seems a good choice.

Alternatively, we could put A in position 4 or 5.

For example, with T in 1: ""TUBAS"" has A in position 4.

""TUBAS"": T1, U2, B3, A4, S5.

A in position 4, which is new.

But we are testing U and B, which are less common than P and H? P and H are more common.

In ""PATHS"", we test P, A (position 2), T (position 3), H, S.

We know A is in the word, so we are focusing on its position.

Similarly, T is in the word, so we are testing its position.

Therefore, I think ""PATHS"" is a solid choice.

So our third guess: ""PATHS"".

But let's confirm the letters: P, A, T, H, S.

None of these are in the absent list: absent are C,R,N,E,L,O,F.

Yes.

So <guess>paths</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, R, N, E are absent (x), and A is present but not in position 3 (-).
- **Guess 2 (ALOFT)**: A is present but not in position 1 (-), L, O, F are absent (x), and T is present but not in position 5 (-).

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: A and T are present, but their positions are unknown.
- **A's possible positions**: Not 1 or 3 (from Guess 1 and 2), so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- **T's possible positions**: Not 5 (from Guess 2), so it must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, L, O, F (cannot be used).
- **Goal for next guess**: Test new positions for A (2, 4, or 5) and T (1, 2, 3, or 4), while covering other common unused letters (e.g., S, P, H, I, D, M).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include A and T**: Since both are confirmed present, we must use them to gather positional information.
- **Test A in position 2**: This position hasn't been tested yet (previously tested positions 1 and 3 were incorrect).
- **Test T in position 3**: This position hasn't been tested (previously tested position 5 was incorrect).
- **Use new common letters**: Add P, H, and S to maximize information (S is highly common; P and H are also frequent).
- **Avoid duplicates and absent letters**: All letters in the guess should be unique and not from the absent list.

The word **""PATHS""** fits perfectly:
- P (position 1), A (position 2), T (position 3), H (position 4), S (position 5).
- A is tested in position 2 (new position).
- T is tested in position 3 (new position).
- Covers P, H, and S (untested common letters).
- All letters are distinct and not absent.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of A and T while checking for the presence of P, H, and S.",Guess 3: paths -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) T(✓) H(x) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,datum,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess:
Guess: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)

Interpretation:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all (marked with x).
- A is in the secret word but not in the correct position (marked with -).

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter A, but it is not the third letter (since in ""CRANE"", A is the third).
- The letters C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.

Therefore, we must avoid using C, R, N, E in our next guess.

We also know:
- The secret word is a 5-letter word that includes A (but not in position 3) and does not include C, R, N, E.

For our next guess, we need:
- To use only letters that are not C, R, N, E.
- To include the letter A, but not in the third position.
- Also, it's good to use other common letters to maximize information.

Common English letters: We can consider letters like S, T, O, L, I, B, P, M, H, etc.

We should avoid positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 having A? Actually, the feedback says A is in the word but not in position 3. So A must be in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5? Actually, no: positions are 1 to 5. In the guess CRANE, the third letter was A and it's marked as present but wrong position. That means in the secret word, A is present but not in the third position. So A must be in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5? No, wait: the feedback only tells us that A is not in position 3. It could be in any other position (1, 2, 4, or 5) or possibly even repeated? But since we know the secret word has one A? Actually, we don't know if there are multiple A's. The feedback only tells us that at least one A is present and not in position 3.

But note: our guess had only one A. If the secret word had two A's, then we might have gotten more information? But in this feedback, we only see A marked as '-' meaning one occurrence (but wrong position) because if there were two A's, and one of them was in another position, we might get another '-' for that position? But the rules don't specify that Wordle shows all occurrences. Actually, the rules of Wordle (as per the example) show:
- For each letter, independently, if it's in the word and in the correct position: ✓
- If it's in the word but not that position: -
- If not: x

And if there are duplicate letters, it can get complex. But since our guess had one A, we know that there is at least one A in the secret word and it is not in position 3.

So, for our next guess, we should include A in a position that is not 3, and avoid letters C, R, N, E.

Let me think of words that have A and are made up of letters from the remaining alphabet.

List of available letters: without C, R, N, E.

We can try a word with A in position 1? Or position 2, 4, or 5.

Common starting letters: We can try words that start with T, S, L, etc.

Since we have A present, let's put A in a different position to test.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

We should also cover other common letters.

A good candidate: ""SALET"" but S, A, L, E, T ... but E is disallowed (we know E is not in the word) so avoid E.

We cannot use E.

Another option: ""TAPIR"" but has R (disallowed).

Avoid R.

What about ""STOMP"" — no A? But we must include A because we know A is in the word, so we should include A to get more information about its position.

We must include A in the next guess? Actually, we don't have to, but it's advisable because we only have one known letter. Otherwise we might waste a guess.

So let's look for words that include A and avoid C, R, N, E.

Options: 
- A in position 1: e.g., A_ _ _ _  (avoid R, N, E, C) 
  - Words: ABYSS, ABBOT, AWAIT, AWAKE (but E is disallowed), AWARD (has R), AWAIT has T? We can use T.

But we have to form a real word.

Let me think: ""AUDIO"" - but U is less common? Also, D, O, I are available.

But let's check: A, U, D, I, O. None of these are C, R, N, E. But note: we don't know if they are in the word or not.

Another word: ""AISLE"" - but has E and it's disallowed.

We must avoid E.

So, how about ""ALOFT"": A, L, O, F, T.

Positions: A in 1, but in our feedback, A was in position 3 in CRANE and got '-'. Now we are trying A in position 1. And we avoid R, N, E, C.

""ALOFT"" consists of A, L, O, F, T.

This seems valid.

Another option: ""ADIEU"" but has E and D? But E is disallowed.

Alternative: ""ABOUT"" - A, B, O, U, T -> has O, U, T which are not forbidden, and B is common.

But note: we don't have any information about B, O, U, T.

Would ""ABOUT"" be a good word? It has A in position 1.

But in CRANE, position 3 was A and it was present but wrong. So if the secret word has A in position 1, then in our next guess putting A in position 1 might get a ✓.

Similarly, we can try A in other positions.

Another word: ""PLANT"" but has N? Disallowed.

So no N.

Let me list a few words:
- ""SAUCE"" has C? Disallowed.
- ""SAULT"" ... but not common? Actually ""SALT"" is not 5 letters.

How about ""SALAD"": S, A, L, A, D — but that's two A's? And we might not know if the word has two A's.

But it uses A twice and we avoid duplicates? Actually, including duplicate letters when we don't know about the frequency might not be optimal.

So avoid duplicates for now.

""SOLAR"" has R? Disallowed.

""MANGA"" has M, A, N, G, A? But N is disallowed.

So ""MANGA"" is invalid because N is disallowed.

Another idea: ""PASTA"" — P, A, S, T, A? Two A's? Or ""PASTE"" has E.

""PASTY"" — P, A, S, T, Y? But Y is less common? And it has A at position 2. And letters: P, A, S, T, Y.

Avoiding C, R, N, E.

So ""PASTY"" could be an option.

But maybe better to cover more common letters? Like T, S, L, O, etc.

Another word: ""TOAST"" has T, O, A, S, T? Two T's? Also, T is repeated.

We can try ""STAID"": S, T, A, I, D.

Letters: S, T, A, I, D — all not forbidden? And A in position 3? But we know from feedback that A is not in position 3? Because in CRANE, A was in position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it exists but not in position 3. So if we put A again in position 3, we'll definitely get a '-' again? Because it's not the correct position? But if we put it elsewhere, we can test other positions.

So putting A in position 3 again is not efficient because we already know it's not there.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should put A in a different position: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

So for ""ALOFT"": A in position 1 (new position).
For ""PASTY"": A in position 2.

Also, consider ""ASHED"" but H, E, D? But E is disallowed.

""ASHEN"" has E and N? Disallowed.

""AVAIL"": A, V, A, I, L? Two A's? But V is not very common.

Maybe ""RAYON"" has R? Disallowed.

I think ""ALOFT"" is acceptable.

But let me confirm: ""ALOFT"" -> A in 1, then L, O, F, T.

Alternatively, ""ALTER"" has E and R? Disallowed.

""ADMIT"" — A, D, M, I, T? A in position 1? And D, M, I, T not used yet.

But we have position 1: A. If we try position 1 A and it's not in the secret word, then we get x for A? But that contradicts previous feedback? Because we know A is in the word. So if the secret word has A and we put A in position 1, then either:
- If the secret word has A in position 1: we get ✓ for position 1.
- If the secret word has A but not in position 1: we get - for position 1.

Which is new information.

Similarly, for any other position.

So let's go with ""ALOFT"".

But we can also consider including more vowels? But we already have A and O.

Other options: ""ABOIL"" — not common.

I think ""ALOFT"" is a reasonable choice.

But note: are there any other constraints? We have 5 positions. Our word: ALOFT.

Alternatively, we could choose ""PAINT"" but has N? Disallowed.

""BLACK"" has C? Disallowed.

So ""ALOFT"" seems a valid word without banned letters.

Another option: ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2? But D and Y are not very common? And we don't know.

""OASIS"" — O in front? Has two S? And A in position 2? But ""OASIS"" has S repeated? And it ends with S which might not be best? But legit.

But I think ""ALOFT"" is better.

Let me consider: We might choose a word that has multiple common letters and includes A not in position 3.

Another word: ""TABBY"" — T, A, B, B, Y? Two B's? Not great.

""TAFFY"" — T, A, F, F, Y? Two F's.

So duplicates might be avoided.

Therefore, I choose ""ALOFT"".

But wait: we need to use unique letters to maximize coverage.

In ""ALOFT"": A, L, O, F, T — all unique letters? Yes.

Therefore, it's efficient.

So our second guess: ""ALOFT"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" with feedback C(not present), R(not present), A(present but wrong position), N(not present), E(not present), we know:

- The secret word contains the letter ""A"", but it is not in the third position (since it appeared in position 3 of ""CRANE"" and was marked with '-').
- The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all (marked with 'x').
- The next guess must be a 5-letter word that includes ""A"" (but not in position 3) and avoids using C, R, N, E.

To gather more information about the position of ""A"" and other potential letters, a good second guess should:
- Place ""A"" in a different position (position 1, 2, 4, or 5) to test for correctness or presence.
- Use common English letters not yet ruled out (avoiding C, R, N, E).
- Prefer unique letters to maximize coverage.

The word ""ALOFT"" fits these criteria:
- It includes ""A"" in position 1 (a new position to check).
- It uses other common letters: L, O, F, T (all not yet tested).
- Each letter is unique, providing additional information about multiple letters.
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help determine if ""A"" is in position 1, and provide feedback on L, O, F, T.

<guess>aloft</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: aloft -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(x) O(x) F(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

Guess 2: ALOFT -> A(-) L(x) O(x) F(x) T(-)
Meaning:
- A is still not in position 1 (since we got '-' for A in position 1).
- L, O, F are not in the word at all (x).
- T is in the word but not in position 5 (since in ALOFT, T is in position 5 and got '-').

So now we know:
- The secret word contains A and T, but we don't know their positions yet.
- A is not in position 1 or 3 (from guesses 1 and 2).
- T is not in position 5 (from guess 2).
- The absent letters are: C, R, N, E, L, O, F.

Therefore, the available letters are all letters except: C, R, N, E, L, O, F.

We also know the word must have A and T.

Now, positions for A: since not 1 or 3, it must be in 2, 4, or 5.
Positions for T: not 5, so it must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But note: we don't know if there are multiple occurrences of any letter, but so far we have only one A and one T indicated.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Includes both A and T (since we know they are in the word).
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, N, E, L, O, F.
- Tries to place A in a new position (2, 4, or 5) and T in a position that is not 5 (so 1,2,3,4) but we can test a new position for T as well.

We also want to cover other common letters that haven't been tested.

What letters have not been tested? From the alphabet, we have used: C, R, A, N, E, L, O, F, T.

So unused common letters: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common ones: S, T (we know is present), A (present), then B, D, G, H, I, K, M, P, S, U, W, Y.

But T and A are already known, so we should use them and add new letters.

We can try to put A in position 2 or 4 or 5, and T in position 1,2,3, or 4 (but not 5).

Let's think of words that fit.

First, since T is not in 5, we can try T in position 1? Or position 2, etc.

Also, A in position 2,4, or 5.

Possible words:

- If we put T in position 1: then the word starts with T, and A is somewhere in 2,4,5.

  Examples: ""TAPIR"" but R is absent -> invalid.
  ""TAXIS"" but has X and S? And A in position 2? But we can try. However, we have to avoid absent letters: R is absent, but TAXIS has no R? T,A,X,I,S. None of these are in the absent list? Absent: C,R,N,E,L,O,F. So T,A,X,I,S are allowed.

  But ""TAXIS"" has two S? Actually, TAXIS is T-A-X-I-S, so no duplicate? T,A,X,I,S are all distinct? Yes.

  But is ""TAXIS"" a valid word? Yes.

  However, we have A in position 2. We know A is not in 1 or 3, but position 2 is possible.

  Alternatively, ""TAMIS"" — not common? Or ""TABIS"" — not sure.

  ""TAPAS"" — but has P and A twice? T,A,P,A,S — two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. It might.

  But to avoid complexity, let's try without duplicates if possible.

  ""TASKS"" — has two S's? T,A,S,K,S — duplicate S.

  ""TAKIS"" — not common.

  So ""TAXIS"" might be acceptable.

- If we put T in position 2: then the word has T in second position, and A in 4 or 5? Because position 2 is taken by T, so A must be in 4 or 5.

  Example: ""STAMP"" but S,T,A,M,P. But S is allowed? And T in position 2? But we have to avoid S? No, S is not in the absent list. Absent: C,R,N,E,L,O,F. So S is allowed.

  ""STAMP"": S in 1, T in 2, A in 3? But we know A is not in position 3! From the first guess. So we cannot put A in position 3.

  Therefore, if T is in position 2, then A must be in 4 or 5.

  So for example: ""UTICA"" but U,T,I,C,A — C is absent! Invalid.

  ""PTARM"" — not a word.

  ""STACK"" has C? Disallowed.

  ""STAGE"" has E? Disallowed.

  ""STAID"" — S,T,A,I,D. But A is in position 3? But position 3 is not allowed for A. So invalid.

  We need A in 4 or 5 when T is in 2.

  Example: ""BATTS"" — B,A,T,T,S? Duplicate T and A in position 2? But we are putting T in position 2? Let's define: if we have T in position 2, then the word is _ T _ _ _

  Then A must be in 4 or 5: so _ T _ A _ or _ T _ _ A

  Examples: ""UTAAT"" not a word.

  ""STAFF"" has F? F is absent (from guess 2, F is x). So invalid.

  ""STACK"" has C? Invalid.

  ""STAIN"" has N? Invalid.

  Hard to find.

  ""STOMP"" has O? O is absent.

  So maybe not many options with T in 2.

- T in position 3: then word is _ _ T _ _

  And A must be in 2,4,5? But position 2: then _ A T _ _ 
  Or position 4: _ _ T A _
  Or position 5: _ _ T _ A

  But we know T is in the word, and we are putting it in position 3. But we don't know if position 3 is correct.

  Example: ""GATOR"" has R? Disallowed.

  ""HATSY"" — H,A,T,S,Y? A in position 2? And T in 3? But we have to avoid absent letters: H,A,T,S,Y are all allowed? Absent: C,R,N,E,L,O,F. So yes.

  But ""HATSY"" might not be a word. ""HATSY"" is not standard.

  ""MATHS"" — M,A,T,H,S? A in position 2, T in 3? And S at the end. But ""MATHS"" is a word.

  But we have A in position 2? We haven't tested position 2 for A yet.

  Similarly, ""PATHS"" — P,A,T,H,S.

  Both are valid.

- T in position 4: then word is _ _ _ T _

  And A must be in 2 or 5? (since not 1,3, and 4 is T, so 2 or 5)

  Example: ""BAITH"" not common. ""WAIST"" has S? But A in position 2? ""WAIST"" is W,A,I,S,T. So A in 2, T in 5? But T is in position 5? But we know T is not in position 5 from guess 2? In guess 2, T was in position 5 and got '-', so T is not in position 5. Therefore, we cannot put T in position 5? But here we are putting T in position 4, and A in 2 or 5.

  For ""WAIST"": positions: W1, A2, I3, S4, T5. But T is in position 5, which we know is wrong. So if we use ""WAIST"", we would be putting T in position 5 again, which we already know is incorrect. So that would be wasteful.

  We should avoid putting T in position 5 because we know it's not there.

  So for T in position 4: the word is _ _ _ T _

  And A in 2 or 5: so _ A _ T _ or _ _ _ T A

  Example: ""PASTA"" but has P,A,S,T,A? Duplicate A? And S. But A in position 2 and 5? But we don't know about multiple A's. Also, ""PASTA"" has A in 2 and 5, and T in 4.

  But we avoid E, etc. P,A,S,T,A — S is allowed, P is allowed.

  But duplicate A.

  ""MASTS"" has duplicate S and T? M,A,S,T,S — not good.

  ""YEAST"" has E? Disallowed.

  So hard to find.

Given the above, let's go back to the first option: T in position 1.

We can try ""TAXIS"": T in 1, A in 2, X in 3, I in 4, S in 5.

But we know A is not in position 3? We don't know about position 2. In this case, A is in position 2, which is a new position.

Also, we are testing X and I and S.

But X is not very common, so it might not be efficient.

Another word with T in 1 and A in 4 or 5?

For example, T in 1 and A in 4: T _ _ A _

With available letters: T, ?, ?, A, ?

Avoiding C,R,N,E,L,O,F.

Possible: ""TUBAS"" — T,U,B,A,S? A in 4? Positions: T1, U2, B3, A4, S5. So A in 4, which is new.

""TUBAS"" is a word.

Similarly, ""TUPIK"" — not common.

""TAMAS"" — T,A,M,A,S? Duplicate A? T1, A2, M3, A4, S5. But A in 2 and 4? We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's multiple.

But we are testing position 2 and 4 for A.

But we already know A is not in 1 or 3, so 2 and 4 are possible.

But in ""TUBAS"", we have A only once, in position 4.

Similarly, T in 1 and A in 5: T _ _ _ A

Example: ""TIPSY"" but no A? ""TIPSY"" is T,I,P,S,Y — no A.

""TODAY"" has O? Disallowed.

""TAPAS"" has A in 2 and 5? T1, A2, P3, A4, S5? But A in 2 and 5? And P and S.

But duplicate A.

""TANKA"" has N? Disallowed.

So ""TUBAS"" seems better: T,U,B,A,S.

All letters distinct, and we test U, B, S as well.

But we have S at the end.

Another option: ""TAPIS"" — T,A,P,I,S? But A in position 2? And we are testing position 2 for A.

""TAPIS"" is a word.

But then we have A in 2, which is new.

We can also consider putting A in position 5? But we have T in 1, then A in 5: T _ _ _ A

Words: ""TABLA"" — T,A,B,L,A? Duplicate A and L is absent? L is absent, so invalid.

""TUBA"" is 4 letters.

""TARGA"" has R? Disallowed.

So hard.

Therefore, let's consider the option with T in position 3? Like ""PATHS"" or ""MATHS"".

""PATHS"": P1, A2, T3, H4, S5.

But we know T is not in position 5? In this word, T is in position 3, not 5. And A is in position 2, which is new.

Also, we avoid absent letters: P, A, T, H, S — all not in the absent list (C,R,N,E,L,O,F).

So ""PATHS"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""MATHS"": M,A,T,H,S.

Both are good.

But note: in ""PATHS"", we have A in position 2 and T in position 3.

We know from guess 1 that A is not in position 3, but position 2 is untested.

Similarly, T in position 3 is untested.

Also, we get to test P, H, S (or M, H, S for ""MATHS"").

Which one to choose? Both are similar.

""PATHS"" might be more common? Or ""MATHS"".

But let's choose ""PATHS"".

Another word: ""BATHS"" — B,A,T,H,S. Also good.

But we can choose any.

I think ""PATHS"" is fine.

But we have to be cautious: if the secret word has A in position 2, then in ""PATHS"" we might get A correct? Or if not, then we know it's not position 2.

Similarly for T in position 3.

Also, we are testing H and S.

S is a very common letter, so good to test.

So let's go with ""PATHS"".

But wait: in the feedback, we have T marked as present but not in position 5. We don't know about position 3.

So ""PATHS"" seems a good choice.

Alternatively, we could put A in position 4 or 5.

For example, with T in 1: ""TUBAS"" has A in position 4.

""TUBAS"": T1, U2, B3, A4, S5.

A in position 4, which is new.

But we are testing U and B, which are less common than P and H? P and H are more common.

In ""PATHS"", we test P, A (position 2), T (position 3), H, S.

We know A is in the word, so we are focusing on its position.

Similarly, T is in the word, so we are testing its position.

Therefore, I think ""PATHS"" is a solid choice.

So our third guess: ""PATHS"".

But let's confirm the letters: P, A, T, H, S.

None of these are in the absent list: absent are C,R,N,E,L,O,F.

Yes.

So <guess>paths</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, R, N, E are absent (x), and A is present but not in position 3 (-).
- **Guess 2 (ALOFT)**: A is present but not in position 1 (-), L, O, F are absent (x), and T is present but not in position 5 (-).

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: A and T are present, but their positions are unknown.
- **A's possible positions**: Not 1 or 3 (from Guess 1 and 2), so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- **T's possible positions**: Not 5 (from Guess 2), so it must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, L, O, F (cannot be used).
- **Goal for next guess**: Test new positions for A (2, 4, or 5) and T (1, 2, 3, or 4), while covering other common unused letters (e.g., S, P, H, I, D, M).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include A and T**: Since both are confirmed present, we must use them to gather positional information.
- **Test A in position 2**: This position hasn't been tested yet (previously tested positions 1 and 3 were incorrect).
- **Test T in position 3**: This position hasn't been tested (previously tested position 5 was incorrect).
- **Use new common letters**: Add P, H, and S to maximize information (S is highly common; P and H are also frequent).
- **Avoid duplicates and absent letters**: All letters in the guess should be unique and not from the absent list.

The word **""PATHS""** fits perfectly:
- P (position 1), A (position 2), T (position 3), H (position 4), S (position 5).
- A is tested in position 2 (new position).
- T is tested in position 3 (new position).
- Covers P, H, and S (untested common letters).
- All letters are distinct and not absent.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of A and T while checking for the presence of P, H, and S.

Actually, the feedback says A is in the word but not in position 3. So A must be in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5? Actually, no: positions are 1 to 5. In the guess CRANE, the third letter was A and it\'s marked as present but wrong position. That means in the secret word, A is present but not in the third position. So A must be in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5? No, wait: the feedback only tells us that A is not in position 3. It could be in any other position (1, 2, 4, or 5) or possibly even repeated? But since we know the secret word has one A? Actually, we don\'t know if there are multiple A\'s. The feedback only tells us that at least one A is present and not in position 3.\n\nBut note: our guess had only one A. If the secret word had two A\'s, then we might have gotten more information? But in this feedback, we only see A marked as \'-\' meaning one occurrence (but wrong position) because if there were two A\'s, and one of them was in another position, we might get another \'-\' for that position? But the rules don\'t specify that Wordle shows all occurrences. Actually, the rules of Wordle (as per the example) show:\n- For each letter, independently, if it\'s in the word and in the correct position: ✓\n- If it\'s in the word but not that position: -\n- If not: x\n\nAnd if there are duplicate letters, it can get complex. But since our guess had one A, we know that there is at least one A in the secret word and it is not in position 3.\n\nSo, for our next guess, we should include A in a position that is not 3, and avoid letters C, R, N, E.\n\nLet me think of words that have A and are made up of letters from the remaining alphabet.\n\nList of available letters: without C, R, N, E.\n\nWe can try a word with A in position 1? Or position 2, 4, or 5.\n\nCommon starting letters: We can try words that start with T, S, L, etc.\n\nSince we have A present, let\'s put A in a different position to test.\n\nPossible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.\n\nWe should also cover other common letters.\n\nA good candidate: ""SALET"" but S, A, L, E, T ... but E is disallowed (we know E is not in the word) so avoid E.\n\nWe cannot use E.\n\nAnother option: ""TAPIR"" but has R (disallowed).\n\nAvoid R.\n\nWhat about ""STOMP"" — no A? But we must include A because we know A is in the word, so we should include A to get more information about its position.\n\nWe must include A in the next guess? Actually, we don\'t have to, but it\'s advisable because we only have one known letter. Otherwise we might waste a guess.\n\nSo let\'s look for words that include A and avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nOptions: \n- A in position 1: e.g., A_ _ _ _  (avoid R, N, E, C) \n  - Words: ABYSS, ABBOT, AWAIT, AWAKE (but E is disallowed), AWARD (has R), AWAIT has T? We can use T.\n\nBut we have to form a real word.\n\nLet me think: ""AUDIO"" - but U is less common? Also, D, O, I are available.\n\nBut let\'s check: A, U, D, I, O. None of these are C, R, N, E. But note: we don\'t know if they are in the word or not.\n\nAnother word: ""AISLE"" - but has E and it\'s disallowed.\n\nWe must avoid E.\n\nSo, how about ""ALOFT"": A, L, O, F, T.\n\nPositions: A in 1, but in our feedback, A was in position 3 in CRANE and got \'-\'. Now we are trying A in position 1. And we avoid R, N, E, C.\n\n""ALOFT"" consists of A, L, O, F, T.\n\nThis seems valid.\n\nAnother option: ""ADIEU"" but has E and D? But E is disallowed.\n\nAlternative: ""ABOUT"" - A, B, O, U, T -> has O, U, T which are not forbidden, and B is common.\n\nBut note: we don\'t have any information about B, O, U, T.\n\nWould ""ABOUT"" be a good word? It has A in position 1.\n\nBut in CRANE, position 3 was A and it was present but wrong. So if the secret word has A in position 1, then in our next guess putting A in position 1 might get a ✓.\n\nSimilarly, we can try A in other positions.\n\nAnother word: ""PLANT"" but has N? Disallowed.\n\nSo no N.\n\nLet me list a few words:\n- ""SAUCE"" has C? Disallowed.\n- ""SAULT"" ... but not common? Actually ""SALT"" is not 5 letters.\n\nHow about ""SALAD"": S, A, L, A, D — but that\'s two A\'s? And we might not know if the word has two A\'s.\n\nBut it uses A twice and we avoid duplicates? Actually, including duplicate letters when we don\'t know about the frequency might not be optimal.\n\nSo avoid duplicates for now.\n\n""SOLAR"" has R? Disallowed.\n\n""MANGA"" has M, A, N, G, A? But N is disallowed.\n\nSo ""MANGA"" is invalid because N is disallowed.\n\nAnother idea: ""PASTA"" — P, A, S, T, A? Two A\'s? Or ""PASTE"" has E.\n\n""PASTY"" — P, A, S, T, Y? But Y is less common? And it has A at position 2. And letters: P, A, S, T, Y.\n\nAvoiding C, R, N, E.\n\nSo ""PASTY"" could be an option.\n\nBut maybe better to cover more common letters? Like T, S, L, O, etc.\n\nAnother word: ""TOAST"" has T, O, A, S, T? Two T\'s? Also, T is repeated.\n\nWe can try ""STAID"": S, T, A, I, D.\n\nLetters: S, T, A, I, D — all not forbidden? And A in position 3? But we know from feedback that A is not in position 3? Because in CRANE, A was in position 3 and we got a \'-\' meaning it exists but not in position 3. So if we put A again in position 3, we\'ll definitely get a \'-\' again? Because it\'s not the correct position? But if we put it elsewhere, we can test other positions.\n\nSo putting A in position 3 again is not efficient because we already know it\'s not there.\n\nTherefore, in our next guess, we should put A in a different position: 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nSo for ""ALOFT"": A in position 1 (new position).\nFor ""PASTY"": A in position 2.\n\nAlso, consider ""ASHED"" but H, E, D? But E is disallowed.\n\n""ASHEN"" has E and N? Disallowed.\n\n""AVAIL"": A, V, A, I, L? Two A\'s? But V is not very common.\n\nMaybe ""RAYON"" has R? Disallowed.\n\nI think ""ALOFT"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let me confirm: ""ALOFT"" -> A in 1, then L, O, F, T.\n\nAlternatively, ""ALTER"" has E and R? Disallowed.\n\n""ADMIT"" — A, D, M, I, T? A in position 1? And D, M, I, T not used yet.\n\nBut we have position 1: A. If we try position 1 A and it\'s not in the secret word, then we get x for A? But that contradicts previous feedback? Because we know A is in the word. So if the secret word has A and we put A in position 1, then either:\n- If the secret word has A in position 1: we get ✓ for position 1.\n- If the secret word has A but not in position 1: we get - for position 1.\n\nWhich is new information.\n\nSimilarly, for any other position.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""ALOFT"".\n\nBut we can also consider including more vowels? But we already have A and O.\n\nOther options: ""ABOIL"" — not common.\n\nI think ""ALOFT"" is a reasonable choice.\n\nBut note: are there any other constraints? We have 5 positions. Our word: ALOFT.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose ""PAINT"" but has N? Disallowed.\n\n""BLACK"" has C? Disallowed.\n\nSo ""ALOFT"" seems a valid word without banned letters.\n\nAnother option: ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2? But D and Y are not very common? And we don\'t know.\n\n""OASIS"" — O in front? Has two S? And A in position 2? But ""OASIS"" has S repeated? And it ends with S which might not be best? But legit.\n\nBut I think ""ALOFT"" is better.\n\nLet me consider: We might choose a word that has multiple common letters and includes A not in position 3.\n\nAnother word: ""TABBY"" — T, A, B, B, Y? Two B\'s? Not great.\n\n""TAFFY"" — T, A, F, F, Y? Two F\'s.\n\nSo duplicates might be avoided.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""ALOFT"".\n\nBut wait: we need to use unique letters to maximize coverage.\n\nIn ""ALOFT"": A, L, O, F, T — all unique letters? Yes.\n\nTherefore, it\'s efficient.\n\nSo our second guess: ""ALOFT"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" with feedback C(not present), R(not present), A(present but wrong position), N(not present), E(not present), we know:\n\n- The secret word contains the letter ""A"", but it is not in the third position (since it appeared in position 3 of ""CRANE"" and was marked with \'-\').\n- The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all (marked with \'x\').\n- The next guess must be a 5-letter word that includes ""A"" (but not in position 3) and avoids using C, R, N, E.\n\nTo gather more information about the position of ""A"" and other potential letters, a good second guess should:\n- Place ""A"" in a different position (position 1, 2, 4, or 5) to test for correctness or presence.\n- Use common English letters not yet ruled out (avoiding C, R, N, E).\n- Prefer unique letters to maximize coverage.\n\nThe word ""ALOFT"" fits these criteria:\n- It includes ""A"" in position 1 (a new position to check).\n- It uses other common letters: L, O, F, T (all not yet tested).\n- Each letter is unique, providing additional information about multiple letters.\n- It is a valid English word.\n\nThis guess will help determine if ""A"" is in position 1, and provide feedback on L, O, F, T.\n\n<guess>aloft</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: aloft -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(x) O(x) F(x) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, N, E are not in the word.\n- A is in the word but not in position 3.\n\nGuess 2: ALOFT -> A(-) L(x) O(x) F(x) T(-)\nMeaning:\n- A is still not in position 1 (since we got \'-\' for A in position 1).\n- L, O, F are not in the word at all (x).\n- T is in the word but not in position 5 (since in ALOFT, T is in position 5 and got \'-\').\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word contains A and T, but we don\'t know their positions yet.\n- A is not in position 1 or 3 (from guesses 1 and 2).\n- T is not in position 5 (from guess 2).\n- The absent letters are: C, R, N, E, L, O, F.\n\nTherefore, the available letters are all letters except: C, R, N, E, L, O, F.\n\nWe also know the word must have A and T.\n\nNow, positions for A: since not 1 or 3, it must be in 2, 4, or 5.\nPositions for T: not 5, so it must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if there are multiple occurrences of any letter, but so far we have only one A and one T indicated.\n\nNow, we need to form a new guess that:\n- Includes both A and T (since we know they are in the word).\n- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, N, E, L, O, F.\n- Tries to place A in a new position (2, 4, or 5) and T in a position that is not 5 (so 1,2,3,4) but we can test a new position for T as well.\n\nWe also want to cover other common letters that haven\'t been tested.\n\nWhat letters have not been tested? From the alphabet, we have used: C, R, A, N, E, L, O, F, T.\n\nSo unused common letters: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon ones: S, T (we know is present), A (present), then B, D, G, H, I, K, M, P, S, U, W, Y.\n\nBut T and A are already known, so we should use them and add new letters.\n\nWe can try to put A in position 2 or 4 or 5, and T in position 1,2,3, or 4 (but not 5).\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit.\n\nFirst, since T is not in 5, we can try T in position 1? Or position 2, etc.\n\nAlso, A in position 2,4, or 5.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- If we put T in position 1: then the word starts with T, and A is somewhere in 2,4,5.\n\n  Examples: ""TAPIR"" but R is absent -> invalid.\n  ""TAXIS"" but has X and S? And A in position 2? But we can try. However, we have to avoid absent letters: R is absent, but TAXIS has no R? T,A,X,I,S. None of these are in the absent list? Absent: C,R,N,E,L,O,F. So T,A,X,I,S are allowed.\n\n  But ""TAXIS"" has two S? Actually, TAXIS is T-A-X-I-S, so no duplicate? T,A,X,I,S are all distinct? Yes.\n\n  But is ""TAXIS"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n  However, we have A in position 2. We know A is not in 1 or 3, but position 2 is possible.\n\n  Alternatively, ""TAMIS"" — not common? Or ""TABIS"" — not sure.\n\n  ""TAPAS"" — but has P and A twice? T,A,P,A,S — two A\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. It might.\n\n  But to avoid complexity, let\'s try without duplicates if possible.\n\n  ""TASKS"" — has two S\'s? T,A,S,K,S — duplicate S.\n\n  ""TAKIS"" — not common.\n\n  So ""TAXIS"" might be acceptable.\n\n- If we put T in position 2: then the word has T in second position, and A in 4 or 5? Because position 2 is taken by T, so A must be in 4 or 5.\n\n  Example: ""STAMP"" but S,T,A,M,P. But S is allowed? And T in position 2? But we have to avoid S? No, S is not in the absent list. Absent: C,R,N,E,L,O,F. So S is allowed.\n\n  ""STAMP"": S in 1, T in 2, A in 3? But we know A is not in position 3! From the first guess. So we cannot put A in position 3.\n\n  Therefore, if T is in position 2, then A must be in 4 or 5.\n\n  So for example: ""UTICA"" but U,T,I,C,A — C is absent! Invalid.\n\n  ""PTARM"" — not a word.\n\n  ""STACK"" has C? Disallowed.\n\n  ""STAGE"" has E? Disallowed.\n\n  ""STAID"" — S,T,A,I,D. But A is in position 3? But position 3 is not allowed for A. So invalid.\n\n  We need A in 4 or 5 when T is in 2.\n\n  Example: ""BATTS"" — B,A,T,T,S? Duplicate T and A in position 2? But we are putting T in position 2? Let\'s define: if we have T in position 2, then the word is _ T _ _ _\n\n  Then A must be in 4 or 5: so _ T _ A _ or _ T _ _ A\n\n  Examples: ""UTAAT"" not a word.\n\n  ""STAFF"" has F? F is absent (from guess 2, F is x). So invalid.\n\n  ""STACK"" has C? Invalid.\n\n  ""STAIN"" has N? Invalid.\n\n  Hard to find.\n\n  ""STOMP"" has O? O is absent.\n\n  So maybe not many options with T in 2.\n\n- T in position 3: then word is _ _ T _ _\n\n  And A must be in 2,4,5? But position 2: then _ A T _ _ \n  Or position 4: _ _ T A _\n  Or position 5: _ _ T _ A\n\n  But we know T is in the word, and we are putting it in position 3. But we don\'t know if position 3 is correct.\n\n  Example: ""GATOR"" has R? Disallowed.\n\n  ""HATSY"" — H,A,T,S,Y? A in position 2? And T in 3? But we have to avoid absent letters: H,A,T,S,Y are all allowed? Absent: C,R,N,E,L,O,F. So yes.\n\n  But ""HATSY"" might not be a word. ""HATSY"" is not standard.\n\n  ""MATHS"" — M,A,T,H,S? A in position 2, T in 3? And S at the end. But ""MATHS"" is a word.\n\n  But we have A in position 2? We haven\'t tested position 2 for A yet.\n\n  Similarly, ""PATHS"" — P,A,T,H,S.\n\n  Both are valid.\n\n- T in position 4: then word is _ _ _ T _\n\n  And A must be in 2 or 5? (since not 1,3, and 4 is T, so 2 or 5)\n\n  Example: ""BAITH"" not common. ""WAIST"" has S? But A in position 2? ""WAIST"" is W,A,I,S,T. So A in 2, T in 5? But T is in position 5? But we know T is not in position 5 from guess 2? In guess 2, T was in position 5 and got \'-\', so T is not in position 5. Therefore, we cannot put T in position 5? But here we are putting T in position 4, and A in 2 or 5.\n\n  For ""WAIST"": positions: W1, A2, I3, S4, T5. But T is in position 5, which we know is wrong. So if we use ""WAIST"", we would be putting T in position 5 again, which we already know is incorrect. So that would be wasteful.\n\n  We should avoid putting T in position 5 because we know it\'s not there.\n\n  So for T in position 4: the word is _ _ _ T _\n\n  And A in 2 or 5: so _ A _ T _ or _ _ _ T A\n\n  Example: ""PASTA"" but has P,A,S,T,A? Duplicate A? And S. But A in position 2 and 5? But we don\'t know about multiple A\'s. Also, ""PASTA"" has A in 2 and 5, and T in 4.\n\n  But we avoid E, etc. P,A,S,T,A — S is allowed, P is allowed.\n\n  But duplicate A.\n\n  ""MASTS"" has duplicate S and T? M,A,S,T,S — not good.\n\n  ""YEAST"" has E? Disallowed.\n\n  So hard to find.\n\nGiven the above, let\'s go back to the first option: T in position 1.\n\nWe can try ""TAXIS"": T in 1, A in 2, X in 3, I in 4, S in 5.\n\nBut we know A is not in position 3? We don\'t know about position 2. In this case, A is in position 2, which is a new position.\n\nAlso, we are testing X and I and S.\n\nBut X is not very common, so it might not be efficient.\n\nAnother word with T in 1 and A in 4 or 5?\n\nFor example, T in 1 and A in 4: T _ _ A _\n\nWith available letters: T, ?, ?, A, ?\n\nAvoiding C,R,N,E,L,O,F.\n\nPossible: ""TUBAS"" — T,U,B,A,S? A in 4? Positions: T1, U2, B3, A4, S5. So A in 4, which is new.\n\n""TUBAS"" is a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""TUPIK"" — not common.\n\n""TAMAS"" — T,A,M,A,S? Duplicate A? T1, A2, M3, A4, S5. But A in 2 and 4? We know A is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s multiple.\n\nBut we are testing position 2 and 4 for A.\n\nBut we already know A is not in 1 or 3, so 2 and 4 are possible.\n\nBut in ""TUBAS"", we have A only once, in position 4.\n\nSimilarly, T in 1 and A in 5: T _ _ _ A\n\nExample: ""TIPSY"" but no A? ""TIPSY"" is T,I,P,S,Y — no A.\n\n""TODAY"" has O? Disallowed.\n\n""TAPAS"" has A in 2 and 5? T1, A2, P3, A4, S5? But A in 2 and 5? And P and S.\n\nBut duplicate A.\n\n""TANKA"" has N? Disallowed.\n\nSo ""TUBAS"" seems better: T,U,B,A,S.\n\nAll letters distinct, and we test U, B, S as well.\n\nBut we have S at the end.\n\nAnother option: ""TAPIS"" — T,A,P,I,S? But A in position 2? And we are testing position 2 for A.\n\n""TAPIS"" is a word.\n\nBut then we have A in 2, which is new.\n\nWe can also consider putting A in position 5? But we have T in 1, then A in 5: T _ _ _ A\n\nWords: ""TABLA"" — T,A,B,L,A? Duplicate A and L is absent? L is absent, so invalid.\n\n""TUBA"" is 4 letters.\n\n""TARGA"" has R? Disallowed.\n\nSo hard.\n\nTherefore, let\'s consider the option with T in position 3? Like ""PATHS"" or ""MATHS"".\n\n""PATHS"": P1, A2, T3, H4, S5.\n\nBut we know T is not in position 5? In this word, T is in position 3, not 5. And A is in position 2, which is new.\n\nAlso, we avoid absent letters: P, A, T, H, S — all not in the absent list (C,R,N,E,L,O,F).\n\nSo ""PATHS"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""MATHS"": M,A,T,H,S.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nBut note: in ""PATHS"", we have A in position 2 and T in position 3.\n\nWe know from guess 1 that A is not in position 3, but position 2 is untested.\n\nSimilarly, T in position 3 is untested.\n\nAlso, we get to test P, H, S (or M, H, S for ""MATHS"").\n\nWhich one to choose? Both are similar.\n\n""PATHS"" might be more common? Or ""MATHS"".\n\nBut let\'s choose ""PATHS"".\n\nAnother word: ""BATHS"" — B,A,T,H,S. Also good.\n\nBut we can choose any.\n\nI think ""PATHS"" is fine.\n\nBut we have to be cautious: if the secret word has A in position 2, then in ""PATHS"" we might get A correct?

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
  - Absent: C, R, N, E
  - Present but wrong position: A (not in pos 3)

Guess 2: ALOFT → A(-), L(x), O(x), F(x), T(-)
  - Absent: L, O, F
  - Present but wrong position: A (not in pos 1) and T (not in pos 5)

Guess 3: PATHS → P(x), A(✓), T(✓), H(x), S(x)
  - Absent: P, H, S
  - Correct: A in position 2, T in position 3

The feedback for Guess 3 is crucial: A(✓) at position 2 and T(✓) at position 3 means letters A and T are confirmed in their positions: the secret word has A as the second letter and T as the third letter. Therefore, the secret word is of the form _ A T _ _.

We also know the following letters are absent: 
C, R, N, E, L, O, F, P, H, S (from all feedback so far).

Additionally, from Guess 1 and Guess 2:
- A is in position 2 (now confirmed)
- T is in position 3 (confirmed)

The letter E was absent in Guess 1, so not in the word.

We now know:
- First letter is unknown (not C,R,N,E,L,O,F,P,H,S)
- Second letter: A
- Third letter: T
- Fourth letter: unknown
- Fifth letter: unknown

And we must avoid using C, R, N, E, L, O, F, P, H, S.

Available letters: Considering common letters, we have: B, D, G, I, J, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Our goal: Guess a word that matches _ A T _ _ and uses available letters.

Since positions 1, 4, and 5 are unknown, we need a word that fits the pattern and uses letters not excluded.

Let's list possible words:

The pattern: ? A T ? ?

And the fourth and fifth letters are unknown.

Since we have only two unknowns (positions 1,4,5? Actually, three positions: 1,4,5) but in Wordle, it's 5 letters.

We have positions: 1,4,5 to fill.

But we know:
- Position 1: cannot be any of the absent letters: C,R,N,E,L,O,F,P,H,S → so must be from the remaining alphabet.
- Positions 4 and 5: similarly, cannot be absent letters.

We can think of common English words with pattern ?AT??

Such as:
- ""BATTY"" → B,A,T,T,Y? But T is repeated? We don't know if T can be repeated, but it could be.
- ""BATTY"" has T twice? But position 3 is T, and position 4 is T? That might be possible.

But in our feedback, do we know if T is duplicated? From Guess 2: T was guessed at position 5 and marked '-' meaning there is at least one T but position 5 is wrong. However, that doesn't rule out a second T. Similarly, in Guess 3, T at position 3 is ✓, so that might be the only T? Or there could be more? The rules don't specify, but typically, if there is a duplicate, we might see additional feedback? But in Wordle, if a letter appears twice in the guess but only once in the secret word, one might be marked correctly or present, and the other absent? But I think we have to be cautious.

However, since the feedback for Guess 2: T at pos 5 was '-', that implies there is at least one T in the word (which we now know is at position 3), so if there were a second T, it might have been marked? But not necessarily—if the secret has only one T and we guessed it at pos 5 incorrectly, and in Guess 3 we guessed it correctly at pos 3, then we have one T.

To avoid complexity, we should assume that T appears only once? But not required.

Similarly, for Guess 1: A was present but in wrong position, now we know it's in pos 2.

Now for Guess 4, we are limited by the known pattern: _ A T _ _

And we need to fill the blanks.

Possible words:
- ""BATTY"" → B,A,T,T,Y → But positions: B1, A2, T3, T4, Y5. So fourth letter is T? But T is already in position 3? If the word has two T's? But ""BATTY"" is valid, but then we have T at position 4? But we don't know that.

We should consider that maybe the word has repeated letters? But let's list without repetition first.

Common words without repeated letters: 
- ""MATTE"" → but E is absent? Disallowed.

""CATAL"" not a word.

""RATIO"" has R? Disallowed.

""DATUM"" → D,A,T,U,M → positions: D1, A2, T3, U4, M5. All distinct? Yes, and letters: D,U,M are acceptable? Absent: C,R,N,E,L,O,F,P,H,S. So D, U, M are available.

Is ""DATUM"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a piece of data.

Another: ""FATAL"" but L? Absent? Disallowed.

""BATIK"" → B,A,T,I,K → positions: B1, A2, T3, I4, K5. Valid word.

""BATON"" but N? Absent? Disallowed.

""WATTY"" → W,A,T,T,Y? Duplicate T.

""MATCH"" has C and H? Disallowed.

""PATCH"" has P and H? Disallowed.

So ""BATIK"" and ""DATUM"" are options.

But let's consider the most common letters: We might want to test frequent consonants like D, B, M, etc.

Another option: ""BALMY"" but L? Disallowed.

""GATED"" has E? Disallowed.

""HAVOC"" has H and C? Disallowed.

So perhaps ""BATIK"" or ""DATUM"".

But we also have ""YETI"" not 5 letters.

We need to cover multiple possibilities.

Since we have three unknowns, we can try a word like ""DIATS"" not a word.

Perhaps ""JATOS"" but J? Or not common.

I think ""BATIK"" is a valid option: B, I, K are untested letters.

Similarly, ""DATUM"" tests D, U, M.

Which one to choose? Both use unique letters and are valid.

Since ""BATIK"" uses letters like I and K which are common? Perhaps.

But we might want to prioritize covering vowels? Or consonants?

The secret word might have a vowel at position 4 or 5? Currently, positions: 1,4,5 are consonants? Not necessarily.

In ""BATIK"": position 4 is I (vowel), position 5 is K (consonant).

In ""DATUM"": position 4 is U (vowel), position 5 M (consonant).

Both have a vowel at position 4? But we don't know.

We can also consider words that end with vowels? But English words usually don't.

Another common word: ""LATTE"" has E? Disallowed.

""MATCH"" invalid.

""PATCH"" invalid.

""WATCH"" has H? Disallowed.

""PATTY"" has P and T twice? Disallowed.

So ""BATIK"" seems good.

But let's check if the letter I or U has been used? No, we haven't used them.

We could try ""BAITH"" not valid.

So I'll choose ""DATUM"" because it uses U and M, which are common enough.

But let's see: in Guess 3, we tested S and it was absent? So cannot use S.

So word: DATUM → D-A-T-U-M

But D, U, M are new.

Similarly, B in ""BATIK"" is new.

But to narrow it down faster, we might pick a word that uses letters that are more frequent.

English letters frequency: D is more frequent than B? Actually, S, D, T are common? But S is absent? We know S is absent.

D is the 7th most common letter, B is 15th? I think B is more common than U and M? But we can use either.

Given that there might be limited possibilities, let's list all possible words? But we don't have a full dictionary.

Perhaps start with B: BAT words? ""BATED"" has E? Disallowed. ""BATES"" has E and S? Disallowed. ""BATIK"" as above.

Similarly for D: ""DATED"" has E? Disallowed. ""DATA"" is 4 letters? ""DATTO"" not common. ""DATUM"" valid.

For G: ""GATOR"" has R? Disallowed. ""GATTY"" duplicate T? ""GATAL"" not valid.

For H: absent? Disallowed.

For I: impossible as first letter? ""I"" words: ""ATTIC"" but A and T fixed? But our pattern is _ A T _ _, so ""IATRY"" not common.

For K: ""KATAS"" but S? Disallowed. ""KATER"" E and R.

For M: ""MATCH"" invalid? ""MATTE"" E. ""MATTS"" has S? Disallowed.

So limited.

Therefore, good candidates: ""BATIK"", ""DATUM"".

But we have another option: ""WATAP"" not common? ""WATT"" no.

""VAPID"" but P? Disallowed? P is absent per Guess 3.

So no.

Another word: ""QAIDS"" not A-T? Pattern.

Possible: ""JATAM"" not common? ""ZATIS"" not common? Unlikely.

So ""BATIK"" and ""DATUM"" are reasonable.

But note: we have to avoid E, etc.

Another word: ""TAMED"" but E? Disallowed.

""CABBY"" but C? Disallowed.

So let's pick ""BATIK"".

But we know that in Guess 2 and 3, T was used at different positions, but now we have the pattern fixed.

Perhaps ""BAITH"" not valid? Or ""YATRA"" — Y,A,T,R,A? R absent? Disallowed.

""FAITH"" F? Absent? Disallowed? F is absent by Guess 2.

So yes, limited.

Therefore, I choose ""BATIK"".

But let me confirm: BATIK is a word (a wax-resist dyeing technique).

Similarly, DATUM is a word.

But BATIK has I and K, DATUM has U and M.

I think BATIK might be more common? Or we can choose DATUM for testing different letters.

To decide: Note that the secret word could also have repeated letters? But perhaps not.

Another word: ""HATCH"" invalid.

So I'll go with ""BATIK"".

Thus, guess: BATIK.

But positions: B in position 1, A in 2 (confirmed), T in 3 (confirmed), I in 4, K in 5.

The feedback might tell us if I and K are present and in which positions? But if the word is correct, we win.

If not, we get clues for position 4 and 5.

So let's reply with BATIK.

But note the pattern: _ A T _ _

And we are guessing B A T I K.

If correct: done.

If incorrect, we get feedback on B, I, K for positions 1,4,5.

Also, by the way, we know A and T are correct, so ✓ and ✓.

So the guess is BATIK.

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) ➔ A is present (but not in position 3), and C, R, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (ALOFT)**: A(-), L(x), O(x), F(x), T(-) ➔ T is present (but not in position 5), and L, O, F are absent. A is still present (but not in position 1).  
- **Guess 3 (PATHS)**: P(x), A(✓), T(✓), H(x), S(x) ➔ A and T are confirmed in positions 2 and 3 respectively, and P, H, S are absent.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word is of the form: **`_ A T _ _`** (second letter is A, third letter is T).
- **Absent letters** (cannot be used): C, R, N, E, L, O, F, P, H, S.
- **Available letters**: B, D, G,I, J, K, M, U, V, X, Y, Z, etc. (focus on common English letters).
- Since positions 1, 4, and 5 are unknown, the next guess should:
  - Adhere to the `_ A T _ _` pattern.
  - Test new common letters for positions 1, 4, and 5 to maximize information.
  - Avoid repeating absent letters.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Position 1**: Test a new common consonant (e.g., B, D, M) to check for correctness.
- **Position 4**: Test a vowel (e.g., I, U) to explore this spot, as English words commonly have vowels in this position after ""AT"".
- **Position 5**: Test another common consonant (e.g., K, M) to cover more ground.
- **Word choice**: ""BATIK"" fits the pattern (`B A T I K`), uses distinct available letters (B, I, K), and is a valid English word (meaning a wax-resist dyeing technique). It tests B in position 1, I in position 4, and K in position 5.

If ""BATIK"" is incorrect, the feedback will reveal details about B, I, and K, narrowing down the possibilities significantly (e.g., if B is correct/present, etc.).

<guess>batik</guess>",batik,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
  - Absent: C, R, N, E
  - Present but wrong position: A (not in pos 3)

Guess 2: ALOFT → A(-), L(x), O(x), F(x), T(-)
  - Absent: L, O, F
  - Present but wrong position: A (not in pos 1) and T (not in pos 5)

Guess 3: PATHS → P(x), A(✓), T(✓), H(x), S(x)
  - Absent: P, H, S
  - Correct: A in position 2, T in position 3

The feedback for Guess 3 is crucial: A(✓) at position 2 and T(✓) at position 3 means letters A and T are confirmed in their positions: the secret word has A as the second letter and T as the third letter. Therefore, the secret word is of the form _ A T _ _.

We also know the following letters are absent: 
C, R, N, E, L, O, F, P, H, S (from all feedback so far).

Additionally, from Guess 1 and Guess 2:
- A is in position 2 (now confirmed)
- T is in position 3 (confirmed)

The letter E was absent in Guess 1, so not in the word.

We now know:
- First letter is unknown (not C,R,N,E,L,O,F,P,H,S)
- Second letter: A
- Third letter: T
- Fourth letter: unknown
- Fifth letter: unknown

And we must avoid using C, R, N, E, L, O, F, P, H, S.

Available letters: Considering common letters, we have: B, D, G, I, J, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Our goal: Guess a word that matches _ A T _ _ and uses available letters.

Since positions 1, 4, and 5 are unknown, we need a word that fits the pattern and uses letters not excluded.

Let's list possible words:

The pattern: ? A T ? ?

And the fourth and fifth letters are unknown.

Since we have only two unknowns (positions 1,4,5? Actually, three positions: 1,4,5) but in Wordle, it's 5 letters.

We have positions: 1,4,5 to fill.

But we know:
- Position 1: cannot be any of the absent letters: C,R,N,E,L,O,F,P,H,S → so must be from the remaining alphabet.
- Positions 4 and 5: similarly, cannot be absent letters.

We can think of common English words with pattern ?AT??

Such as:
- ""BATTY"" → B,A,T,T,Y? But T is repeated? We don't know if T can be repeated, but it could be.
- ""BATTY"" has T twice? But position 3 is T, and position 4 is T? That might be possible.

But in our feedback, do we know if T is duplicated? From Guess 2: T was guessed at position 5 and marked '-' meaning there is at least one T but position 5 is wrong. However, that doesn't rule out a second T. Similarly, in Guess 3, T at position 3 is ✓, so that might be the only T? Or there could be more? The rules don't specify, but typically, if there is a duplicate, we might see additional feedback? But in Wordle, if a letter appears twice in the guess but only once in the secret word, one might be marked correctly or present, and the other absent? But I think we have to be cautious.

However, since the feedback for Guess 2: T at pos 5 was '-', that implies there is at least one T in the word (which we now know is at position 3), so if there were a second T, it might have been marked? But not necessarily—if the secret has only one T and we guessed it at pos 5 incorrectly, and in Guess 3 we guessed it correctly at pos 3, then we have one T.

To avoid complexity, we should assume that T appears only once? But not required.

Similarly, for Guess 1: A was present but in wrong position, now we know it's in pos 2.

Now for Guess 4, we are limited by the known pattern: _ A T _ _

And we need to fill the blanks.

Possible words:
- ""BATTY"" → B,A,T,T,Y → But positions: B1, A2, T3, T4, Y5. So fourth letter is T? But T is already in position 3? If the word has two T's? But ""BATTY"" is valid, but then we have T at position 4? But we don't know that.

We should consider that maybe the word has repeated letters? But let's list without repetition first.

Common words without repeated letters: 
- ""MATTE"" → but E is absent? Disallowed.

""CATAL"" not a word.

""RATIO"" has R? Disallowed.

""DATUM"" → D,A,T,U,M → positions: D1, A2, T3, U4, M5. All distinct? Yes, and letters: D,U,M are acceptable? Absent: C,R,N,E,L,O,F,P,H,S. So D, U, M are available.

Is ""DATUM"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a piece of data.

Another: ""FATAL"" but L? Absent? Disallowed.

""BATIK"" → B,A,T,I,K → positions: B1, A2, T3, I4, K5. Valid word.

""BATON"" but N? Absent? Disallowed.

""WATTY"" → W,A,T,T,Y? Duplicate T.

""MATCH"" has C and H? Disallowed.

""PATCH"" has P and H? Disallowed.

So ""BATIK"" and ""DATUM"" are options.

But let's consider the most common letters: We might want to test frequent consonants like D, B, M, etc.

Another option: ""BALMY"" but L? Disallowed.

""GATED"" has E? Disallowed.

""HAVOC"" has H and C? Disallowed.

So perhaps ""BATIK"" or ""DATUM"".

But we also have ""YETI"" not 5 letters.

We need to cover multiple possibilities.

Since we have three unknowns, we can try a word like ""DIATS"" not a word.

Perhaps ""JATOS"" but J? Or not common.

I think ""BATIK"" is a valid option: B, I, K are untested letters.

Similarly, ""DATUM"" tests D, U, M.

Which one to choose? Both use unique letters and are valid.

Since ""BATIK"" uses letters like I and K which are common? Perhaps.

But we might want to prioritize covering vowels? Or consonants?

The secret word might have a vowel at position 4 or 5? Currently, positions: 1,4,5 are consonants? Not necessarily.

In ""BATIK"": position 4 is I (vowel), position 5 is K (consonant).

In ""DATUM"": position 4 is U (vowel), position 5 M (consonant).

Both have a vowel at position 4? But we don't know.

We can also consider words that end with vowels? But English words usually don't.

Another common word: ""LATTE"" has E? Disallowed.

""MATCH"" invalid.

""PATCH"" invalid.

""WATCH"" has H? Disallowed.

""PATTY"" has P and T twice? Disallowed.

So ""BATIK"" seems good.

But let's check if the letter I or U has been used? No, we haven't used them.

We could try ""BAITH"" not valid.

So I'll choose ""DATUM"" because it uses U and M, which are common enough.

But let's see: in Guess 3, we tested S and it was absent? So cannot use S.

So word: DATUM → D-A-T-U-M

But D, U, M are new.

Similarly, B in ""BATIK"" is new.

But to narrow it down faster, we might pick a word that uses letters that are more frequent.

English letters frequency: D is more frequent than B? Actually, S, D, T are common? But S is absent? We know S is absent.

D is the 7th most common letter, B is 15th? I think B is more common than U and M? But we can use either.

Given that there might be limited possibilities, let's list all possible words? But we don't have a full dictionary.

Perhaps start with B: BAT words? ""BATED"" has E? Disallowed. ""BATES"" has E and S? Disallowed. ""BATIK"" as above.

Similarly for D: ""DATED"" has E? Disallowed. ""DATA"" is 4 letters? ""DATTO"" not common. ""DATUM"" valid.

For G: ""GATOR"" has R? Disallowed. ""GATTY"" duplicate T? ""GATAL"" not valid.

For H: absent? Disallowed.

For I: impossible as first letter? ""I"" words: ""ATTIC"" but A and T fixed? But our pattern is _ A T _ _, so ""IATRY"" not common.

For K: ""KATAS"" but S? Disallowed. ""KATER"" E and R.

For M: ""MATCH"" invalid? ""MATTE"" E. ""MATTS"" has S? Disallowed.

So limited.

Therefore, good candidates: ""BATIK"", ""DATUM"".

But we have another option: ""WATAP"" not common? ""WATT"" no.

""VAPID"" but P? Disallowed? P is absent per Guess 3.

So no.

Another word: ""QAIDS"" not A-T? Pattern.

Possible: ""JATAM"" not common? ""ZATIS"" not common? Unlikely.

So ""BATIK"" and ""DATUM"" are reasonable.

But note: we have to avoid E, etc.

Another word: ""TAMED"" but E? Disallowed.

""CABBY"" but C? Disallowed.

So let's pick ""BATIK"".

But we know that in Guess 2 and 3, T was used at different positions, but now we have the pattern fixed.

Perhaps ""BAITH"" not valid? Or ""YATRA"" — Y,A,T,R,A? R absent? Disallowed.

""FAITH"" F? Absent? Disallowed? F is absent by Guess 2.

So yes, limited.

Therefore, I choose ""BATIK"".

But let me confirm: BATIK is a word (a wax-resist dyeing technique).

Similarly, DATUM is a word.

But BATIK has I and K, DATUM has U and M.

I think BATIK might be more common? Or we can choose DATUM for testing different letters.

To decide: Note that the secret word could also have repeated letters? But perhaps not.

Another word: ""HATCH"" invalid.

So I'll go with ""BATIK"".

Thus, guess: BATIK.

But positions: B in position 1, A in 2 (confirmed), T in 3 (confirmed), I in 4, K in 5.

The feedback might tell us if I and K are present and in which positions? But if the word is correct, we win.

If not, we get clues for position 4 and 5.

So let's reply with BATIK.

But note the pattern: _ A T _ _

And we are guessing B A T I K.

If correct: done.

If incorrect, we get feedback on B, I, K for positions 1,4,5.

Also, by the way, we know A and T are correct, so ✓ and ✓.

So the guess is BATIK.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess:
Guess: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)

Interpretation:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all (marked with x).
- A is in the secret word but not in the correct position (marked with -).

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter A, but it is not the third letter (since in ""CRANE"", A is the third).
- The letters C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.

Therefore, we must avoid using C, R, N, E in our next guess.

We also know:
- The secret word is a 5-letter word that includes A (but not in position 3) and does not include C, R, N, E.

For our next guess, we need:
- To use only letters that are not C, R, N, E.
- To include the letter A, but not in the third position.
- Also, it's good to use other common letters to maximize information.

Common English letters: We can consider letters like S, T, O, L, I, B, P, M, H, etc.

We should avoid positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 having A? Actually, the feedback says A is in the word but not in position 3. So A must be in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5? Actually, no: positions are 1 to 5. In the guess CRANE, the third letter was A and it's marked as present but wrong position. That means in the secret word, A is present but not in the third position. So A must be in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5? No, wait: the feedback only tells us that A is not in position 3. It could be in any other position (1, 2, 4, or 5) or possibly even repeated? But since we know the secret word has one A? Actually, we don't know if there are multiple A's. The feedback only tells us that at least one A is present and not in position 3.

But note: our guess had only one A. If the secret word had two A's, then we might have gotten more information? But in this feedback, we only see A marked as '-' meaning one occurrence (but wrong position) because if there were two A's, and one of them was in another position, we might get another '-' for that position? But the rules don't specify that Wordle shows all occurrences. Actually, the rules of Wordle (as per the example) show:
- For each letter, independently, if it's in the word and in the correct position: ✓
- If it's in the word but not that position: -
- If not: x

And if there are duplicate letters, it can get complex. But since our guess had one A, we know that there is at least one A in the secret word and it is not in position 3.

So, for our next guess, we should include A in a position that is not 3, and avoid letters C, R, N, E.

Let me think of words that have A and are made up of letters from the remaining alphabet.

List of available letters: without C, R, N, E.

We can try a word with A in position 1? Or position 2, 4, or 5.

Common starting letters: We can try words that start with T, S, L, etc.

Since we have A present, let's put A in a different position to test.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

We should also cover other common letters.

A good candidate: ""SALET"" but S, A, L, E, T ... but E is disallowed (we know E is not in the word) so avoid E.

We cannot use E.

Another option: ""TAPIR"" but has R (disallowed).

Avoid R.

What about ""STOMP"" — no A? But we must include A because we know A is in the word, so we should include A to get more information about its position.

We must include A in the next guess? Actually, we don't have to, but it's advisable because we only have one known letter. Otherwise we might waste a guess.

So let's look for words that include A and avoid C, R, N, E.

Options: 
- A in position 1: e.g., A_ _ _ _  (avoid R, N, E, C) 
  - Words: ABYSS, ABBOT, AWAIT, AWAKE (but E is disallowed), AWARD (has R), AWAIT has T? We can use T.

But we have to form a real word.

Let me think: ""AUDIO"" - but U is less common? Also, D, O, I are available.

But let's check: A, U, D, I, O. None of these are C, R, N, E. But note: we don't know if they are in the word or not.

Another word: ""AISLE"" - but has E and it's disallowed.

We must avoid E.

So, how about ""ALOFT"": A, L, O, F, T.

Positions: A in 1, but in our feedback, A was in position 3 in CRANE and got '-'. Now we are trying A in position 1. And we avoid R, N, E, C.

""ALOFT"" consists of A, L, O, F, T.

This seems valid.

Another option: ""ADIEU"" but has E and D? But E is disallowed.

Alternative: ""ABOUT"" - A, B, O, U, T -> has O, U, T which are not forbidden, and B is common.

But note: we don't have any information about B, O, U, T.

Would ""ABOUT"" be a good word? It has A in position 1.

But in CRANE, position 3 was A and it was present but wrong. So if the secret word has A in position 1, then in our next guess putting A in position 1 might get a ✓.

Similarly, we can try A in other positions.

Another word: ""PLANT"" but has N? Disallowed.

So no N.

Let me list a few words:
- ""SAUCE"" has C? Disallowed.
- ""SAULT"" ... but not common? Actually ""SALT"" is not 5 letters.

How about ""SALAD"": S, A, L, A, D — but that's two A's? And we might not know if the word has two A's.

But it uses A twice and we avoid duplicates? Actually, including duplicate letters when we don't know about the frequency might not be optimal.

So avoid duplicates for now.

""SOLAR"" has R? Disallowed.

""MANGA"" has M, A, N, G, A? But N is disallowed.

So ""MANGA"" is invalid because N is disallowed.

Another idea: ""PASTA"" — P, A, S, T, A? Two A's? Or ""PASTE"" has E.

""PASTY"" — P, A, S, T, Y? But Y is less common? And it has A at position 2. And letters: P, A, S, T, Y.

Avoiding C, R, N, E.

So ""PASTY"" could be an option.

But maybe better to cover more common letters? Like T, S, L, O, etc.

Another word: ""TOAST"" has T, O, A, S, T? Two T's? Also, T is repeated.

We can try ""STAID"": S, T, A, I, D.

Letters: S, T, A, I, D — all not forbidden? And A in position 3? But we know from feedback that A is not in position 3? Because in CRANE, A was in position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it exists but not in position 3. So if we put A again in position 3, we'll definitely get a '-' again? Because it's not the correct position? But if we put it elsewhere, we can test other positions.

So putting A in position 3 again is not efficient because we already know it's not there.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should put A in a different position: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

So for ""ALOFT"": A in position 1 (new position).
For ""PASTY"": A in position 2.

Also, consider ""ASHED"" but H, E, D? But E is disallowed.

""ASHEN"" has E and N? Disallowed.

""AVAIL"": A, V, A, I, L? Two A's? But V is not very common.

Maybe ""RAYON"" has R? Disallowed.

I think ""ALOFT"" is acceptable.

But let me confirm: ""ALOFT"" -> A in 1, then L, O, F, T.

Alternatively, ""ALTER"" has E and R? Disallowed.

""ADMIT"" — A, D, M, I, T? A in position 1? And D, M, I, T not used yet.

But we have position 1: A. If we try position 1 A and it's not in the secret word, then we get x for A? But that contradicts previous feedback? Because we know A is in the word. So if the secret word has A and we put A in position 1, then either:
- If the secret word has A in position 1: we get ✓ for position 1.
- If the secret word has A but not in position 1: we get - for position 1.

Which is new information.

Similarly, for any other position.

So let's go with ""ALOFT"".

But we can also consider including more vowels? But we already have A and O.

Other options: ""ABOIL"" — not common.

I think ""ALOFT"" is a reasonable choice.

But note: are there any other constraints? We have 5 positions. Our word: ALOFT.

Alternatively, we could choose ""PAINT"" but has N? Disallowed.

""BLACK"" has C? Disallowed.

So ""ALOFT"" seems a valid word without banned letters.

Another option: ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2? But D and Y are not very common? And we don't know.

""OASIS"" — O in front? Has two S? And A in position 2? But ""OASIS"" has S repeated? And it ends with S which might not be best? But legit.

But I think ""ALOFT"" is better.

Let me consider: We might choose a word that has multiple common letters and includes A not in position 3.

Another word: ""TABBY"" — T, A, B, B, Y? Two B's? Not great.

""TAFFY"" — T, A, F, F, Y? Two F's.

So duplicates might be avoided.

Therefore, I choose ""ALOFT"".

But wait: we need to use unique letters to maximize coverage.

In ""ALOFT"": A, L, O, F, T — all unique letters? Yes.

Therefore, it's efficient.

So our second guess: ""ALOFT"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" with feedback C(not present), R(not present), A(present but wrong position), N(not present), E(not present), we know:

- The secret word contains the letter ""A"", but it is not in the third position (since it appeared in position 3 of ""CRANE"" and was marked with '-').
- The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all (marked with 'x').
- The next guess must be a 5-letter word that includes ""A"" (but not in position 3) and avoids using C, R, N, E.

To gather more information about the position of ""A"" and other potential letters, a good second guess should:
- Place ""A"" in a different position (position 1, 2, 4, or 5) to test for correctness or presence.
- Use common English letters not yet ruled out (avoiding C, R, N, E).
- Prefer unique letters to maximize coverage.

The word ""ALOFT"" fits these criteria:
- It includes ""A"" in position 1 (a new position to check).
- It uses other common letters: L, O, F, T (all not yet tested).
- Each letter is unique, providing additional information about multiple letters.
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help determine if ""A"" is in position 1, and provide feedback on L, O, F, T.

<guess>aloft</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: aloft -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(x) O(x) F(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

Guess 2: ALOFT -> A(-) L(x) O(x) F(x) T(-)
Meaning:
- A is still not in position 1 (since we got '-' for A in position 1).
- L, O, F are not in the word at all (x).
- T is in the word but not in position 5 (since in ALOFT, T is in position 5 and got '-').

So now we know:
- The secret word contains A and T, but we don't know their positions yet.
- A is not in position 1 or 3 (from guesses 1 and 2).
- T is not in position 5 (from guess 2).
- The absent letters are: C, R, N, E, L, O, F.

Therefore, the available letters are all letters except: C, R, N, E, L, O, F.

We also know the word must have A and T.

Now, positions for A: since not 1 or 3, it must be in 2, 4, or 5.
Positions for T: not 5, so it must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But note: we don't know if there are multiple occurrences of any letter, but so far we have only one A and one T indicated.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Includes both A and T (since we know they are in the word).
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, N, E, L, O, F.
- Tries to place A in a new position (2, 4, or 5) and T in a position that is not 5 (so 1,2,3,4) but we can test a new position for T as well.

We also want to cover other common letters that haven't been tested.

What letters have not been tested? From the alphabet, we have used: C, R, A, N, E, L, O, F, T.

So unused common letters: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common ones: S, T (we know is present), A (present), then B, D, G, H, I, K, M, P, S, U, W, Y.

But T and A are already known, so we should use them and add new letters.

We can try to put A in position 2 or 4 or 5, and T in position 1,2,3, or 4 (but not 5).

Let's think of words that fit.

First, since T is not in 5, we can try T in position 1? Or position 2, etc.

Also, A in position 2,4, or 5.

Possible words:

- If we put T in position 1: then the word starts with T, and A is somewhere in 2,4,5.

  Examples: ""TAPIR"" but R is absent -> invalid.
  ""TAXIS"" but has X and S? And A in position 2? But we can try. However, we have to avoid absent letters: R is absent, but TAXIS has no R? T,A,X,I,S. None of these are in the absent list? Absent: C,R,N,E,L,O,F. So T,A,X,I,S are allowed.

  But ""TAXIS"" has two S? Actually, TAXIS is T-A-X-I-S, so no duplicate? T,A,X,I,S are all distinct? Yes.

  But is ""TAXIS"" a valid word? Yes.

  However, we have A in position 2. We know A is not in 1 or 3, but position 2 is possible.

  Alternatively, ""TAMIS"" — not common? Or ""TABIS"" — not sure.

  ""TAPAS"" — but has P and A twice? T,A,P,A,S — two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. It might.

  But to avoid complexity, let's try without duplicates if possible.

  ""TASKS"" — has two S's? T,A,S,K,S — duplicate S.

  ""TAKIS"" — not common.

  So ""TAXIS"" might be acceptable.

- If we put T in position 2: then the word has T in second position, and A in 4 or 5? Because position 2 is taken by T, so A must be in 4 or 5.

  Example: ""STAMP"" but S,T,A,M,P. But S is allowed? And T in position 2? But we have to avoid S? No, S is not in the absent list. Absent: C,R,N,E,L,O,F. So S is allowed.

  ""STAMP"": S in 1, T in 2, A in 3? But we know A is not in position 3! From the first guess. So we cannot put A in position 3.

  Therefore, if T is in position 2, then A must be in 4 or 5.

  So for example: ""UTICA"" but U,T,I,C,A — C is absent! Invalid.

  ""PTARM"" — not a word.

  ""STACK"" has C? Disallowed.

  ""STAGE"" has E? Disallowed.

  ""STAID"" — S,T,A,I,D. But A is in position 3? But position 3 is not allowed for A. So invalid.

  We need A in 4 or 5 when T is in 2.

  Example: ""BATTS"" — B,A,T,T,S? Duplicate T and A in position 2? But we are putting T in position 2? Let's define: if we have T in position 2, then the word is _ T _ _ _

  Then A must be in 4 or 5: so _ T _ A _ or _ T _ _ A

  Examples: ""UTAAT"" not a word.

  ""STAFF"" has F? F is absent (from guess 2, F is x). So invalid.

  ""STACK"" has C? Invalid.

  ""STAIN"" has N? Invalid.

  Hard to find.

  ""STOMP"" has O? O is absent.

  So maybe not many options with T in 2.

- T in position 3: then word is _ _ T _ _

  And A must be in 2,4,5? But position 2: then _ A T _ _ 
  Or position 4: _ _ T A _
  Or position 5: _ _ T _ A

  But we know T is in the word, and we are putting it in position 3. But we don't know if position 3 is correct.

  Example: ""GATOR"" has R? Disallowed.

  ""HATSY"" — H,A,T,S,Y? A in position 2? And T in 3? But we have to avoid absent letters: H,A,T,S,Y are all allowed? Absent: C,R,N,E,L,O,F. So yes.

  But ""HATSY"" might not be a word. ""HATSY"" is not standard.

  ""MATHS"" — M,A,T,H,S? A in position 2, T in 3? And S at the end. But ""MATHS"" is a word.

  But we have A in position 2? We haven't tested position 2 for A yet.

  Similarly, ""PATHS"" — P,A,T,H,S.

  Both are valid.

- T in position 4: then word is _ _ _ T _

  And A must be in 2 or 5? (since not 1,3, and 4 is T, so 2 or 5)

  Example: ""BAITH"" not common. ""WAIST"" has S? But A in position 2? ""WAIST"" is W,A,I,S,T. So A in 2, T in 5? But T is in position 5? But we know T is not in position 5 from guess 2? In guess 2, T was in position 5 and got '-', so T is not in position 5. Therefore, we cannot put T in position 5? But here we are putting T in position 4, and A in 2 or 5.

  For ""WAIST"": positions: W1, A2, I3, S4, T5. But T is in position 5, which we know is wrong. So if we use ""WAIST"", we would be putting T in position 5 again, which we already know is incorrect. So that would be wasteful.

  We should avoid putting T in position 5 because we know it's not there.

  So for T in position 4: the word is _ _ _ T _

  And A in 2 or 5: so _ A _ T _ or _ _ _ T A

  Example: ""PASTA"" but has P,A,S,T,A? Duplicate A? And S. But A in position 2 and 5? But we don't know about multiple A's. Also, ""PASTA"" has A in 2 and 5, and T in 4.

  But we avoid E, etc. P,A,S,T,A — S is allowed, P is allowed.

  But duplicate A.

  ""MASTS"" has duplicate S and T? M,A,S,T,S — not good.

  ""YEAST"" has E? Disallowed.

  So hard to find.

Given the above, let's go back to the first option: T in position 1.

We can try ""TAXIS"": T in 1, A in 2, X in 3, I in 4, S in 5.

But we know A is not in position 3? We don't know about position 2. In this case, A is in position 2, which is a new position.

Also, we are testing X and I and S.

But X is not very common, so it might not be efficient.

Another word with T in 1 and A in 4 or 5?

For example, T in 1 and A in 4: T _ _ A _

With available letters: T, ?, ?, A, ?

Avoiding C,R,N,E,L,O,F.

Possible: ""TUBAS"" — T,U,B,A,S? A in 4? Positions: T1, U2, B3, A4, S5. So A in 4, which is new.

""TUBAS"" is a word.

Similarly, ""TUPIK"" — not common.

""TAMAS"" — T,A,M,A,S? Duplicate A? T1, A2, M3, A4, S5. But A in 2 and 4? We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's multiple.

But we are testing position 2 and 4 for A.

But we already know A is not in 1 or 3, so 2 and 4 are possible.

But in ""TUBAS"", we have A only once, in position 4.

Similarly, T in 1 and A in 5: T _ _ _ A

Example: ""TIPSY"" but no A? ""TIPSY"" is T,I,P,S,Y — no A.

""TODAY"" has O? Disallowed.

""TAPAS"" has A in 2 and 5? T1, A2, P3, A4, S5? But A in 2 and 5? And P and S.

But duplicate A.

""TANKA"" has N? Disallowed.

So ""TUBAS"" seems better: T,U,B,A,S.

All letters distinct, and we test U, B, S as well.

But we have S at the end.

Another option: ""TAPIS"" — T,A,P,I,S? But A in position 2? And we are testing position 2 for A.

""TAPIS"" is a word.

But then we have A in 2, which is new.

We can also consider putting A in position 5? But we have T in 1, then A in 5: T _ _ _ A

Words: ""TABLA"" — T,A,B,L,A? Duplicate A and L is absent? L is absent, so invalid.

""TUBA"" is 4 letters.

""TARGA"" has R? Disallowed.

So hard.

Therefore, let's consider the option with T in position 3? Like ""PATHS"" or ""MATHS"".

""PATHS"": P1, A2, T3, H4, S5.

But we know T is not in position 5? In this word, T is in position 3, not 5. And A is in position 2, which is new.

Also, we avoid absent letters: P, A, T, H, S — all not in the absent list (C,R,N,E,L,O,F).

So ""PATHS"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""MATHS"": M,A,T,H,S.

Both are good.

But note: in ""PATHS"", we have A in position 2 and T in position 3.

We know from guess 1 that A is not in position 3, but position 2 is untested.

Similarly, T in position 3 is untested.

Also, we get to test P, H, S (or M, H, S for ""MATHS"").

Which one to choose? Both are similar.

""PATHS"" might be more common? Or ""MATHS"".

But let's choose ""PATHS"".

Another word: ""BATHS"" — B,A,T,H,S. Also good.

But we can choose any.

I think ""PATHS"" is fine.

But we have to be cautious: if the secret word has A in position 2, then in ""PATHS"" we might get A correct? Or if not, then we know it's not position 2.

Similarly for T in position 3.

Also, we are testing H and S.

S is a very common letter, so good to test.

So let's go with ""PATHS"".

But wait: in the feedback, we have T marked as present but not in position 5. We don't know about position 3.

So ""PATHS"" seems a good choice.

Alternatively, we could put A in position 4 or 5.

For example, with T in 1: ""TUBAS"" has A in position 4.

""TUBAS"": T1, U2, B3, A4, S5.

A in position 4, which is new.

But we are testing U and B, which are less common than P and H? P and H are more common.

In ""PATHS"", we test P, A (position 2), T (position 3), H, S.

We know A is in the word, so we are focusing on its position.

Similarly, T is in the word, so we are testing its position.

Therefore, I think ""PATHS"" is a solid choice.

So our third guess: ""PATHS"".

But let's confirm the letters: P, A, T, H, S.

None of these are in the absent list: absent are C,R,N,E,L,O,F.

Yes.

So <guess>paths</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, R, N, E are absent (x), and A is present but not in position 3 (-).
- **Guess 2 (ALOFT)**: A is present but not in position 1 (-), L, O, F are absent (x), and T is present but not in position 5 (-).

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: A and T are present, but their positions are unknown.
- **A's possible positions**: Not 1 or 3 (from Guess 1 and 2), so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- **T's possible positions**: Not 5 (from Guess 2), so it must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, L, O, F (cannot be used).
- **Goal for next guess**: Test new positions for A (2, 4, or 5) and T (1, 2, 3, or 4), while covering other common unused letters (e.g., S, P, H, I, D, M).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include A and T**: Since both are confirmed present, we must use them to gather positional information.
- **Test A in position 2**: This position hasn't been tested yet (previously tested positions 1 and 3 were incorrect).
- **Test T in position 3**: This position hasn't been tested (previously tested position 5 was incorrect).
- **Use new common letters**: Add P, H, and S to maximize information (S is highly common; P and H are also frequent).
- **Avoid duplicates and absent letters**: All letters in the guess should be unique and not from the absent list.

The word **""PATHS""** fits perfectly:
- P (position 1), A (position 2), T (position 3), H (position 4), S (position 5).
- A is tested in position 2 (new position).
- T is tested in position 3 (new position).
- Covers P, H, and S (untested common letters).
- All letters are distinct and not absent.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of A and T while checking for the presence of P, H, and S.

Guess 2: ALOFT → A(-), L(x), O(x), F(x), T(-)
  - Absent: L, O, F
  - Present but wrong position: A (not in pos 1) and T (not in pos 5)

Guess 3: PATHS → P(x), A(✓), T(✓), H(x), S(x)
  - Absent: P, H, S
  - Correct: A in position 2, T in position 3

The feedback for Guess 3 is crucial: A(✓) at position 2 and T(✓) at position 3 means letters A and T are confirmed in their positions: the secret word has A as the second letter and T as the third letter. Therefore, the secret word is of the form _ A T _ _.

We also know the following letters are absent: 
C, R, N, E, L, O, F, P, H, S (from all feedback so far).

Additionally, from Guess 1 and Guess 2:
- A is in position 2 (now confirmed)
- T is in position 3 (confirmed)

The letter E was absent in Guess 1, so not in the word.

We now know:
- First letter is unknown (not C,R,N,E,L,O,F,P,H,S)
- Second letter: A
- Third letter: T
- Fourth letter: unknown
- Fifth letter: unknown

And we must avoid using C, R, N, E, L, O, F, P, H, S.

Available letters: Considering common letters, we have: B, D, G, I, J, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Our goal: Guess a word that matches _ A T _ _ and uses available letters.

Since positions 1, 4, and 5 are unknown, we need a word that fits the pattern and uses letters not excluded.

Let's list possible words:

The pattern: ? A T ? ?

And the fourth and fifth letters are unknown.

Since we have only two unknowns (positions 1,4,5? Actually, three positions: 1,4,5) but in Wordle, it's 5 letters.

We have positions: 1,4,5 to fill.

But we know:
- Position 1: cannot be any of the absent letters: C,R,N,E,L,O,F,P,H,S → so must be from the remaining alphabet.
- Positions 4 and 5: similarly, cannot be absent letters.

We can think of common English words with pattern ?AT??

Such as:
- ""BATTY"" → B,A,T,T,Y? But T is repeated? We don't know if T can be repeated, but it could be.
- ""BATTY"" has T twice? But position 3 is T, and position 4 is T? That might be possible.

But in our feedback, do we know if T is duplicated? From Guess 2: T was guessed at position 5 and marked '-' meaning there is at least one T but position 5 is wrong. However, that doesn't rule out a second T. Similarly, in Guess 3, T at position 3 is ✓, so that might be the only T? Or there could be more? The rules don't specify, but typically, if there is a duplicate, we might see additional feedback? But in Wordle, if a letter appears twice in the guess but only once in the secret word, one might be marked correctly or present, and the other absent? But I think we have to be cautious.

However, since the feedback for Guess 2: T at pos 5 was '-', that implies there is at least one T in the word (which we now know is at position 3), so if there were a second T, it might have been marked? But not necessarily—if the secret has only one T and we guessed it at pos 5 incorrectly, and in Guess 3 we guessed it correctly at pos 3, then we have one T.

To avoid complexity, we should assume that T appears only once? But not required.

Similarly, for Guess 1: A was present but in wrong position, now we know it's in pos 2.

Now for Guess 4, we are limited by the known pattern: _ A T _ _

And we need to fill the blanks.

Possible words:
- ""BATTY"" → B,A,T,T,Y → But positions: B1, A2, T3, T4, Y5. So fourth letter is T? But T is already in position 3? If the word has two T's? But ""BATTY"" is valid, but then we have T at position 4? But we don't know that.

We should consider that maybe the word has repeated letters? But let's list without repetition first.

Common words without repeated letters: 
- ""MATTE"" → but E is absent? Disallowed.

""CATAL"" not a word.

""RATIO"" has R? Disallowed.

""DATUM"" → D,A,T,U,M → positions: D1, A2, T3, U4, M5. All distinct? Yes, and letters: D,U,M are acceptable? Absent: C,R,N,E,L,O,F,P,H,S. So D, U, M are available.

Is ""DATUM"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a piece of data.

Another: ""FATAL"" but L? Absent? Disallowed.

""BATIK"" → B,A,T,I,K → positions: B1, A2, T3, I4, K5. Valid word.

""BATON"" but N? Absent? Disallowed.

""WATTY"" → W,A,T,T,Y? Duplicate T.

""MATCH"" has C and H? Disallowed.

""PATCH"" has P and H? Disallowed.

So ""BATIK"" and ""DATUM"" are options.

But let's consider the most common letters: We might want to test frequent consonants like D, B, M, etc.

Another option: ""BALMY"" but L? Disallowed.

""GATED"" has E? Disallowed.

""HAVOC"" has H and C? Disallowed.

So perhaps ""BATIK"" or ""DATUM"".

But we also have ""YETI"" not 5 letters.

We need to cover multiple possibilities.

Since we have three unknowns, we can try a word like ""DIATS"" not a word.

Perhaps ""JATOS"" but J? Or not common.

I think ""BATIK"" is a valid option: B, I, K are untested letters.

Similarly, ""DATUM"" tests D, U, M.

Which one to choose? Both use unique letters and are valid.

Since ""BATIK"" uses letters like I and K which are common? Perhaps.

But we might want to prioritize covering vowels? Or consonants?

The secret word might have a vowel at position 4 or 5? Currently, positions: 1,4,5 are consonants? Not necessarily.

In ""BATIK"": position 4 is I (vowel), position 5 is K (consonant).

In ""DATUM"": position 4 is U (vowel), position 5 M (consonant).

Both have a vowel at position 4? But we don't know.

We can also consider words that end with vowels? But English words usually don't.

Another common word: ""LATTE"" has E? Disallowed.

""MATCH"" invalid.

""PATCH"" invalid.

""WATCH"" has H? Disallowed.

""PATTY"" has P and T twice? Disallowed.

So ""BATIK"" seems good.

But let's check if the letter I or U has been used? No, we haven't used them.

We could try ""BAITH"" not valid.

So I'll choose ""DATUM"" because it uses U and M, which are common enough.

But let's see: in Guess 3, we tested S and it was absent? So cannot use S.

So word: DATUM → D-A-T-U-M

But D, U, M are new.

Similarly, B in ""BATIK"" is new.

But to narrow it down faster, we might pick a word that uses letters that are more frequent.

English letters frequency: D is more frequent than B? Actually, S, D, T are common? But S is absent? We know S is absent.

D is the 7th most common letter, B is 15th? I think B is more common than U and M? But we can use either.

Given that there might be limited possibilities, let's list all possible words? But we don't have a full dictionary.

Perhaps start with B: BAT words? ""BATED"" has E? Disallowed. ""BATES"" has E and S? Disallowed. ""BATIK"" as above.

Similarly for D: ""DATED"" has E? Disallowed. ""DATA"" is 4 letters? ""DATTO"" not common. ""DATUM"" valid.

For G: ""GATOR"" has R? Disallowed. ""GATTY"" duplicate T? ""GATAL"" not valid.

For H: absent? Disallowed.

For I: impossible as first letter? ""I"" words: ""ATTIC"" but A and T fixed? But our pattern is _ A T _ _, so ""IATRY"" not common.

For K: ""KATAS"" but S? Disallowed. ""KATER"" E and R.

For M: ""MATCH"" invalid? ""MATTE"" E. ""MATTS"" has S? Disallowed.

So limited.

Therefore, good candidates: ""BATIK"", ""DATUM"".

But we have another option: ""WATAP"" not common? ""WATT"" no.

""VAPID"" but P? Disallowed? P is absent per Guess 3.

So no.

Another word: ""QAIDS"" not A-T? Pattern.

Possible: ""JATAM"" not common? ""ZATIS"" not common? Unlikely.

So ""BATIK"" and ""DATUM"" are reasonable.

But note: we have to avoid E, etc.

Another word: ""TAMED"" but E? Disallowed.

""CABBY"" but C? Disallowed.

So let's pick ""BATIK"".

But we know that in Guess 2 and 3, T was used at different positions, but now we have the pattern fixed.

Perhaps ""BAITH"" not valid? Or ""YATRA"" — Y,A,T,R,A? R absent? Disallowed.

""FAITH"" F? Absent? Disallowed? F is absent by Guess 2.

So yes, limited.

Therefore, I choose ""BATIK"".

But let me confirm: BATIK is a word (a wax-resist dyeing technique).

Similarly, DATUM is a word.

But BATIK has I and K, DATUM has U and M.

I think BATIK might be more common? Or we can choose DATUM for testing different letters.

To decide: Note that the secret word could also have repeated letters? But perhaps not.

Another word: ""HATCH"" invalid.

So I'll go with ""BATIK"".

Thus, guess: BATIK.

But positions: B in position 1, A in 2 (confirmed), T in 3 (confirmed), I in 4, K in 5.

The feedback might tell us if I and K are present and in which positions? But if the word is correct, we win.

If not, we get clues for position 4 and 5.

So let's reply with BATIK.

But note the pattern: _ A T _ _

And we are guessing B A T I K.

If correct: done.

If incorrect, we get feedback on B, I, K for positions 1,4,5.

Also, by the way, we know A and T are correct, so ✓ and ✓.

So the guess is BATIK.

<guess>batik</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) ➔ A is present (but not in position 3), and C, R, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (ALOFT)**: A(-), L(x), O(x), F(x), T(-) ➔ T is present (but not in position 5), and L, O, F are absent. A is still present (but not in position 1).  
- **Guess 3 (PATHS)**: P(x), A(✓), T(✓), H(x), S(x) ➔ A and T are confirmed in positions 2 and 3 respectively, and P, H, S are absent.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word is of the form: **`_ A T _ _`** (second letter is A, third letter is T).
- **Absent letters** (cannot be used): C, R, N, E, L, O, F, P, H, S.
- **Available letters**: B, D, G,I, J, K, M, U, V, X, Y, Z, etc. (focus on common English letters).
- Since positions 1, 4, and 5 are unknown, the next guess should:
  - Adhere to the `_ A T _ _` pattern.
  - Test new common letters for positions 1, 4, and 5 to maximize information.
  - Avoid repeating absent letters.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Position 1**: Test a new common consonant (e.g., B, D, M) to check for correctness.
- **Position 4**: Test a vowel (e.g., I, U) to explore this spot, as English words commonly have vowels in this position after ""AT"".
- **Position 5**: Test another common consonant (e.g., K, M) to cover more ground.
- **Word choice**: ""BATIK"" fits the pattern (`B A T I K`), uses distinct available letters (B, I, K), and is a valid English word (meaning a wax-resist dyeing technique). It tests B in position 1, I in position 4, and K in position 5.

If ""BATIK"" is incorrect, the feedback will reveal details about B, I, and K, narrowing down the possibilities significantly (e.g., if B is correct/present, etc.).

Actually, the feedback says A is in the word but not in position 3. So A must be in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5? Actually, no: positions are 1 to 5. In the guess CRANE, the third letter was A and it\'s marked as present but wrong position. That means in the secret word, A is present but not in the third position. So A must be in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5? No, wait: the feedback only tells us that A is not in position 3. It could be in any other position (1, 2, 4, or 5) or possibly even repeated? But since we know the secret word has one A? Actually, we don\'t know if there are multiple A\'s. The feedback only tells us that at least one A is present and not in position 3.\n\nBut note: our guess had only one A. If the secret word had two A\'s, then we might have gotten more information? But in this feedback, we only see A marked as \'-\' meaning one occurrence (but wrong position) because if there were two A\'s, and one of them was in another position, we might get another \'-\' for that position? But the rules don\'t specify that Wordle shows all occurrences. Actually, the rules of Wordle (as per the example) show:\n- For each letter, independently, if it\'s in the word and in the correct position: ✓\n- If it\'s in the word but not that position: -\n- If not: x\n\nAnd if there are duplicate letters, it can get complex. But since our guess had one A, we know that there is at least one A in the secret word and it is not in position 3.\n\nSo, for our next guess, we should include A in a position that is not 3, and avoid letters C, R, N, E.\n\nLet me think of words that have A and are made up of letters from the remaining alphabet.\n\nList of available letters: without C, R, N, E.\n\nWe can try a word with A in position 1? Or position 2, 4, or 5.\n\nCommon starting letters: We can try words that start with T, S, L, etc.\n\nSince we have A present, let\'s put A in a different position to test.\n\nPossible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.\n\nWe should also cover other common letters.\n\nA good candidate: ""SALET"" but S, A, L, E, T ... but E is disallowed (we know E is not in the word) so avoid E.\n\nWe cannot use E.\n\nAnother option: ""TAPIR"" but has R (disallowed).\n\nAvoid R.\n\nWhat about ""STOMP"" — no A? But we must include A because we know A is in the word, so we should include A to get more information about its position.\n\nWe must include A in the next guess? Actually, we don\'t have to, but it\'s advisable because we only have one known letter. Otherwise we might waste a guess.\n\nSo let\'s look for words that include A and avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nOptions: \n- A in position 1: e.g., A_ _ _ _  (avoid R, N, E, C) \n  - Words: ABYSS, ABBOT, AWAIT, AWAKE (but E is disallowed), AWARD (has R), AWAIT has T? We can use T.\n\nBut we have to form a real word.\n\nLet me think: ""AUDIO"" - but U is less common? Also, D, O, I are available.\n\nBut let\'s check: A, U, D, I, O. None of these are C, R, N, E. But note: we don\'t know if they are in the word or not.\n\nAnother word: ""AISLE"" - but has E and it\'s disallowed.\n\nWe must avoid E.\n\nSo, how about ""ALOFT"": A, L, O, F, T.\n\nPositions: A in 1, but in our feedback, A was in position 3 in CRANE and got \'-\'. Now we are trying A in position 1. And we avoid R, N, E, C.\n\n""ALOFT"" consists of A, L, O, F, T.\n\nThis seems valid.\n\nAnother option: ""ADIEU"" but has E and D? But E is disallowed.\n\nAlternative: ""ABOUT"" - A, B, O, U, T -> has O, U, T which are not forbidden, and B is common.\n\nBut note: we don\'t have any information about B, O, U, T.\n\nWould ""ABOUT"" be a good word? It has A in position 1.\n\nBut in CRANE, position 3 was A and it was present but wrong. So if the secret word has A in position 1, then in our next guess putting A in position 1 might get a ✓.\n\nSimilarly, we can try A in other positions.\n\nAnother word: ""PLANT"" but has N? Disallowed.\n\nSo no N.\n\nLet me list a few words:\n- ""SAUCE"" has C? Disallowed.\n- ""SAULT"" ... but not common? Actually ""SALT"" is not 5 letters.\n\nHow about ""SALAD"": S, A, L, A, D — but that\'s two A\'s? And we might not know if the word has two A\'s.\n\nBut it uses A twice and we avoid duplicates? Actually, including duplicate letters when we don\'t know about the frequency might not be optimal.\n\nSo avoid duplicates for now.\n\n""SOLAR"" has R? Disallowed.\n\n""MANGA"" has M, A, N, G, A? But N is disallowed.\n\nSo ""MANGA"" is invalid because N is disallowed.\n\nAnother idea: ""PASTA"" — P, A, S, T, A? Two A\'s? Or ""PASTE"" has E.\n\n""PASTY"" — P, A, S, T, Y? But Y is less common? And it has A at position 2. And letters: P, A, S, T, Y.\n\nAvoiding C, R, N, E.\n\nSo ""PASTY"" could be an option.\n\nBut maybe better to cover more common letters? Like T, S, L, O, etc.\n\nAnother word: ""TOAST"" has T, O, A, S, T? Two T\'s? Also, T is repeated.\n\nWe can try ""STAID"": S, T, A, I, D.\n\nLetters: S, T, A, I, D — all not forbidden? And A in position 3? But we know from feedback that A is not in position 3? Because in CRANE, A was in position 3 and we got a \'-\' meaning it exists but not in position 3. So if we put A again in position 3, we\'ll definitely get a \'-\' again? Because it\'s not the correct position? But if we put it elsewhere, we can test other positions.\n\nSo putting A in position 3 again is not efficient because we already know it\'s not there.\n\nTherefore, in our next guess, we should put A in a different position: 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nSo for ""ALOFT"": A in position 1 (new position).\nFor ""PASTY"": A in position 2.\n\nAlso, consider ""ASHED"" but H, E, D? But E is disallowed.\n\n""ASHEN"" has E and N? Disallowed.\n\n""AVAIL"": A, V, A, I, L? Two A\'s? But V is not very common.\n\nMaybe ""RAYON"" has R? Disallowed.\n\nI think ""ALOFT"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let me confirm: ""ALOFT"" -> A in 1, then L, O, F, T.\n\nAlternatively, ""ALTER"" has E and R? Disallowed.\n\n""ADMIT"" — A, D, M, I, T? A in position 1? And D, M, I, T not used yet.\n\nBut we have position 1: A. If we try position 1 A and it\'s not in the secret word, then we get x for A? But that contradicts previous feedback? Because we know A is in the word. So if the secret word has A and we put A in position 1, then either:\n- If the secret word has A in position 1: we get ✓ for position 1.\n- If the secret word has A but not in position 1: we get - for position 1.\n\nWhich is new information.\n\nSimilarly, for any other position.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""ALOFT"".\n\nBut we can also consider including more vowels? But we already have A and O.\n\nOther options: ""ABOIL"" — not common.\n\nI think ""ALOFT"" is a reasonable choice.\n\nBut note: are there any other constraints? We have 5 positions. Our word: ALOFT.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose ""PAINT"" but has N? Disallowed.\n\n""BLACK"" has C? Disallowed.\n\nSo ""ALOFT"" seems a valid word without banned letters.\n\nAnother option: ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2? But D and Y are not very common? And we don\'t know.\n\n""OASIS"" — O in front? Has two S? And A in position 2? But ""OASIS"" has S repeated? And it ends with S which might not be best? But legit.\n\nBut I think ""ALOFT"" is better.\n\nLet me consider: We might choose a word that has multiple common letters and includes A not in position 3.\n\nAnother word: ""TABBY"" — T, A, B, B, Y? Two B\'s? Not great.\n\n""TAFFY"" — T, A, F, F, Y? Two F\'s.\n\nSo duplicates might be avoided.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""ALOFT"".\n\nBut wait: we need to use unique letters to maximize coverage.\n\nIn ""ALOFT"": A, L, O, F, T — all unique letters? Yes.\n\nTherefore, it\'s efficient.\n\nSo our second guess: ""ALOFT"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" with feedback C(not present), R(not present), A(present but wrong position), N(not present), E(not present), we know:\n\n- The secret word contains the letter ""A"", but it is not in the third position (since it appeared in position 3 of ""CRANE"" and was marked with \'-\').\n- The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all (marked with \'x\').\n- The next guess must be a 5-letter word that includes ""A"" (but not in position 3) and avoids using C, R, N, E.\n\nTo gather more information about the position of ""A"" and other potential letters, a good second guess should:\n- Place ""A"" in a different position (position 1, 2, 4, or 5) to test for correctness or presence.\n- Use common English letters not yet ruled out (avoiding C, R, N, E).\n- Prefer unique letters to maximize coverage.\n\nThe word ""ALOFT"" fits these criteria:\n- It includes ""A"" in position 1 (a new position to check).\n- It uses other common letters: L, O, F, T (all not yet tested).\n- Each letter is unique, providing additional information about multiple letters.\n- It is a valid English word.\n\nThis guess will help determine if ""A"" is in position 1, and provide feedback on L, O, F, T.\n\n<guess>aloft</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: aloft -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(x) O(x) F(x) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, N, E are not in the word.\n- A is in the word but not in position 3.\n\nGuess 2: ALOFT -> A(-) L(x) O(x) F(x) T(-)\nMeaning:\n- A is still not in position 1 (since we got \'-\' for A in position 1).\n- L, O, F are not in the word at all (x).\n- T is in the word but not in position 5 (since in ALOFT, T is in position 5 and got \'-\').\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word contains A and T, but we don\'t know their positions yet.\n- A is not in position 1 or 3 (from guesses 1 and 2).\n- T is not in position 5 (from guess 2).\n- The absent letters are: C, R, N, E, L, O, F.\n\nTherefore, the available letters are all letters except: C, R, N, E, L, O, F.\n\nWe also know the word must have A and T.\n\nNow, positions for A: since not 1 or 3, it must be in 2, 4, or 5.\nPositions for T: not 5, so it must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if there are multiple occurrences of any letter, but so far we have only one A and one T indicated.\n\nNow, we need to form a new guess that:\n- Includes both A and T (since we know they are in the word).\n- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, N, E, L, O, F.\n- Tries to place A in a new position (2, 4, or 5) and T in a position that is not 5 (so 1,2,3,4) but we can test a new position for T as well.\n\nWe also want to cover other common letters that haven\'t been tested.\n\nWhat letters have not been tested?

Or position 2, etc.\n\nAlso, A in position 2,4, or 5.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- If we put T in position 1: then the word starts with T, and A is somewhere in 2,4,5.\n\n  Examples: ""TAPIR"" but R is absent -> invalid.\n  ""TAXIS"" but has X and S? And A in position 2? But we can try. However, we have to avoid absent letters: R is absent, but TAXIS has no R? T,A,X,I,S. None of these are in the absent list? Absent: C,R,N,E,L,O,F. So T,A,X,I,S are allowed.\n\n  But ""TAXIS"" has two S? Actually, TAXIS is T-A-X-I-S, so no duplicate? T,A,X,I,S are all distinct? Yes.\n\n  But is ""TAXIS"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n  However, we have A in position 2. We know A is not in 1 or 3, but position 2 is possible.\n\n  Alternatively, ""TAMIS"" — not common? Or ""TABIS"" — not sure.\n\n  ""TAPAS"" — but has P and A twice? T,A,P,A,S — two A\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. It might.\n\n  But to avoid complexity, let\'s try without duplicates if possible.\n\n  ""TASKS"" — has two S\'s? T,A,S,K,S — duplicate S.\n\n  ""TAKIS"" — not common.\n\n  So ""TAXIS"" might be acceptable.\n\n- If we put T in position 2: then the word has T in second position, and A in 4 or 5? Because position 2 is taken by T, so A must be in 4 or 5.\n\n  Example: ""STAMP"" but S,T,A,M,P. But S is allowed? And T in position 2? But we have to avoid S? No, S is not in the absent list. Absent: C,R,N,E,L,O,F. So S is allowed.\n\n  ""STAMP"": S in 1, T in 2, A in 3? But we know A is not in position 3! From the first guess. So we cannot put A in position 3.\n\n  Therefore, if T is in position 2, then A must be in 4 or 5.\n\n  So for example: ""UTICA"" but U,T,I,C,A — C is absent! Invalid.\n\n  ""PTARM"" — not a word.\n\n  ""STACK"" has C? Disallowed.\n\n  ""STAGE"" has E? Disallowed.\n\n  ""STAID"" — S,T,A,I,D. But A is in position 3? But position 3 is not allowed for A. So invalid.\n\n  We need A in 4 or 5 when T is in 2.\n\n  Example: ""BATTS"" — B,A,T,T,S? Duplicate T and A in position 2? But we are putting T in position 2? Let\'s define: if we have T in position 2, then the word is _ T _ _ _\n\n  Then A must be in 4 or 5: so _ T _ A _ or _ T _ _ A\n\n  Examples: ""UTAAT"" not a word.\n\n  ""STAFF"" has F? F is absent (from guess 2, F is x). So invalid.\n\n  ""STACK"" has C? Invalid.\n\n  ""STAIN"" has N? Invalid.\n\n  Hard to find.\n\n  ""STOMP"" has O? O is absent.\n\n  So maybe not many options with T in 2.\n\n- T in position 3: then word is _ _ T _ _\n\n  And A must be in 2,4,5? But position 2: then _ A T _ _ \n  Or position 4: _ _ T A _\n  Or position 5: _ _ T _ A\n\n  But we know T is in the word, and we are putting it in position 3. But we don\'t know if position 3 is correct.\n\n  Example: ""GATOR"" has R? Disallowed.\n\n  ""HATSY"" — H,A,T,S,Y? A in position 2? And T in 3? But we have to avoid absent letters: H,A,T,S,Y are all allowed? Absent: C,R,N,E,L,O,F. So yes.\n\n  But ""HATSY"" might not be a word. ""HATSY"" is not standard.\n\n  ""MATHS"" — M,A,T,H,S? A in position 2, T in 3? And S at the end. But ""MATHS"" is a word.\n\n  But we have A in position 2? We haven\'t tested position 2 for A yet.\n\n  Similarly, ""PATHS"" — P,A,T,H,S.\n\n  Both are valid.\n\n- T in position 4: then word is _ _ _ T _\n\n  And A must be in 2 or 5? (since not 1,3, and 4 is T, so 2 or 5)\n\n  Example: ""BAITH"" not common. ""WAIST"" has S? But A in position 2? ""WAIST"" is W,A,I,S,T. So A in 2, T in 5? But T is in position 5? But we know T is not in position 5 from guess 2? In guess 2, T was in position 5 and got \'-\', so T is not in position 5. Therefore, we cannot put T in position 5? But here we are putting T in position 4, and A in 2 or 5.\n\n  For ""WAIST"": positions: W1, A2, I3, S4, T5. But T is in position 5, which we know is wrong. So if we use ""WAIST"", we would be putting T in position 5 again, which we already know is incorrect. So that would be wasteful.\n\n  We should avoid putting T in position 5 because we know it\'s not there.\n\n  So for T in position 4: the word is _ _ _ T _\n\n  And A in 2 or 5: so _ A _ T _ or _ _ _ T A\n\n  Example: ""PASTA"" but has P,A,S,T,A? Duplicate A? And S. But A in position 2 and 5? But we don\'t know about multiple A\'s. Also, ""PASTA"" has A in 2 and 5, and T in 4.\n\n  But we avoid E, etc. P,A,S,T,A — S is allowed, P is allowed.\n\n  But duplicate A.\n\n  ""MASTS"" has duplicate S and T? M,A,S,T,S — not good.\n\n  ""YEAST"" has E? Disallowed.\n\n  So hard to find.\n\nGiven the above, let\'s go back to the first option: T in position 1.\n\nWe can try ""TAXIS"": T in 1, A in 2, X in 3, I in 4, S in 5.\n\nBut we know A is not in position 3? We don\'t know about position 2. In this case, A is in position 2, which is a new position.\n\nAlso, we are testing X and I and S.\n\nBut X is not very common, so it might not be efficient.\n\nAnother word with T in 1 and A in 4 or 5?\n\nFor example, T in 1 and A in 4: T _ _ A _\n\nWith available letters: T, ?, ?, A, ?\n\nAvoiding C,R,N,E,L,O,F.\n\nPossible: ""TUBAS"" — T,U,B,A,S? A in 4? Positions: T1, U2, B3, A4, S5. So A in 4, which is new.\n\n""TUBAS"" is a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""TUPIK"" — not common.\n\n""TAMAS"" — T,A,M,A,S? Duplicate A? T1, A2, M3, A4, S5. But A in 2 and 4? We know A is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s multiple.\n\nBut we are testing position 2 and 4 for A.\n\nBut we already know A is not in 1 or 3, so 2 and 4 are possible.\n\nBut in ""TUBAS"", we have A only once, in position 4.\n\nSimilarly, T in 1 and A in 5: T _ _ _ A\n\nExample: ""TIPSY"" but no A? ""TIPSY"" is T,I,P,S,Y — no A.\n\n""TODAY"" has O? Disallowed.\n\n""TAPAS"" has A in 2 and 5? T1, A2, P3, A4, S5? But A in 2 and 5? And P and S.\n\nBut duplicate A.\n\n""TANKA"" has N? Disallowed.\n\nSo ""TUBAS"" seems better: T,U,B,A,S.\n\nAll letters distinct, and we test U, B, S as well.\n\nBut we have S at the end.\n\nAnother option: ""TAPIS"" — T,A,P,I,S? But A in position 2? And we are testing position 2 for A.\n\n""TAPIS"" is a word.\n\nBut then we have A in 2, which is new.\n\nWe can also consider putting A in position 5? But we have T in 1, then A in 5: T _ _ _ A\n\nWords: ""TABLA"" — T,A,B,L,A? Duplicate A and L is absent? L is absent, so invalid.\n\n""TUBA"" is 4 letters.\n\n""TARGA"" has R? Disallowed.\n\nSo hard.\n\nTherefore, let\'s consider the option with T in position 3? Like ""PATHS"" or ""MATHS"".\n\n""PATHS"": P1, A2, T3, H4, S5.\n\nBut we know T is not in position 5? In this word, T is in position 3, not 5. And A is in position 2, which is new.\n\nAlso, we avoid absent letters: P, A, T, H, S — all not in the absent list (C,R,N,E,L,O,F).\n\nSo ""PATHS"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""MATHS"": M,A,T,H,S.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nBut note: in ""PATHS"", we have A in position 2 and T in position 3.\n\nWe know from guess 1 that A is not in position 3, but position 2 is untested.\n\nSimilarly, T in position 3 is untested.\n\nAlso, we get to test P, H, S (or M, H, S for ""MATHS"").\n\nWhich one to choose? Both are similar.\n\n""PATHS"" might be more common? Or ""MATHS"".\n\nBut let\'s choose ""PATHS"".\n\nAnother word: ""BATHS"" — B,A,T,H,S. Also good.\n\nBut we can choose any.\n\nI think ""PATHS"" is fine.\n\nBut we have to be cautious: if the secret word has A in position 2, then in ""PATHS"" we might get A correct? Or if not, then we know it\'s not position 2.\n\nSimilarly for T in position 3.\n\nAlso, we are testing H and S.\n\nS is a very common letter, so good to test.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""PATHS"".\n\nBut wait: in the feedback, we have T marked as present but not in position 5. We don\'t know about position 3.\n\nSo ""PATHS"" seems a good choice.\n\nAlternatively, we could put A in position 4 or 5.\n\nFor example, with T in 1: ""TUBAS"" has A in position 4.\n\n""TUBAS"": T1, U2, B3, A4, S5.\n\nA in position 4, which is new.\n\nBut we are testing U and B, which are less common than P and H? P and H are more common.\n\nIn ""PATHS"", we test P, A (position 2), T (position 3), H, S.\n\nWe know A is in the word, so we are focusing on its position.\n\nSimilarly, T is in the word, so we are testing its position.\n\nTherefore, I think ""PATHS"" is a solid choice.\n\nSo our third guess: ""PATHS"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters: P, A, T, H, S.\n\nNone of these are in the absent list: absent are C,R,N,E,L,O,F.\n\nYes.\n\nSo <guess>paths</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, R, N, E are absent (x), and A is present but not in position 3 (-).\n- **Guess 2 (ALOFT)**: A is present but not in position 1 (-), L, O, F are absent (x), and T is present but not in position 5 (-).\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: A and T are present, but their positions are unknown.\n- **A\'s possible positions**: Not 1 or 3 (from Guess 1 and 2), so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.\n- **T\'s possible positions**: Not 5 (from Guess 2), so it must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, L, O, F (cannot be used).\n- **Goal for next guess**: Test new positions for A (2, 4, or 5) and T (1, 2, 3, or 4), while covering other common unused letters (e.g., S, P, H, I, D, M).\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- **Include A and T**: Since both are confirmed present, we must use them to gather positional information.\n- **Test A in position 2**: This position hasn\'t been tested yet (previously tested positions 1 and 3 were incorrect).\n- **Test T in position 3**: This position hasn\'t been tested (previously tested position 5 was incorrect).\n- **Use new common letters**: Add P, H, and S to maximize information (S is highly common; P and H are also frequent).\n- **Avoid duplicates and absent letters**: All letters in the guess should be unique and not from the absent list.\n\nThe word **""PATHS""** fits perfectly:\n- P (position 1), A (position 2), T (position 3), H (position 4), S (position 5).\n- A is tested in position 2 (new position).\n- T is tested in position 3 (new position).\n- Covers P, H, and S (untested common letters).\n- All letters are distinct and not absent.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of A and T while checking for the presence of P, H, and S.\n\n<guess>paths</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: aloft -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(x) O(x) F(x) T(-)\nGuess 3: paths -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) T(✓) H(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)\n  - Absent: C, R, N, E\n  - Present but wrong position: A (not in pos 3)\n\nGuess 2: ALOFT → A(-), L(x), O(x), F(x), T(-)\n  - Absent: L, O, F\n  - Present but wrong position: A (not in pos 1) and T (not in pos 5)\n\nGuess 3: PATHS → P(x), A(✓), T(✓), H(x), S(x)\n  - Absent: P, H, S\n  - Correct: A in position 2, T in position 3\n\nThe feedback for Guess 3 is crucial: A(✓) at position 2 and T(✓) at position 3 means letters A and T are confirmed in their positions: the secret word has A as the second letter and T as the third letter. Therefore, the secret word is of the form _ A T _ _.\n\nWe also know the following letters are absent: \nC, R, N, E, L, O, F, P, H, S (from all feedback so far).\n\nAdditionally, from Guess 1 and Guess 2:\n- A is in position 2 (now confirmed)\n- T is in position 3 (confirmed)\n\nThe letter E was absent in Guess 1, so not in the word.\n\nWe now know:\n- First letter is unknown (not C,R,N,E,L,O,F,P,H,S)\n- Second letter: A\n- Third letter: T\n- Fourth letter: unknown\n- Fifth letter: unknown\n\nAnd we must avoid using C, R, N, E, L, O, F, P, H, S.\n\nAvailable letters: Considering common letters, we have: B, D, G, I, J, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nOur goal: Guess a word that matches _ A T _ _ and uses available letters.\n\nSince positions 1, 4, and 5 are unknown, we need a word that fits the pattern and uses letters not excluded.\n\nLet\'s list possible words:\n\nThe pattern: ? A T ? ?\n\nAnd the fourth and fifth letters are unknown.\n\nSince we have only two unknowns (positions 1,4,5? Actually, three positions: 1,4,5) but in Wordle, it\'s 5 letters.\n\nWe have positions: 1,4,5 to fill.\n\nBut we know:\n- Position 1: cannot be any of the absent letters: C,R,N,E,L,O,F,P,H,S → so must be from the remaining alphabet.\n- Positions 4 and 5: similarly, cannot be absent letters.\n\nWe can think of common English words with pattern ?AT??\n\nSuch as:\n- ""BATTY"" → B,A,T,T,Y? But T is repeated? We don\'t know if T can be repeated, but it could be.\n- ""BATTY"" has T twice? But position 3 is T, and position 4 is T? That might be possible.\n\nBut in our feedback, do we know if T is duplicated? From Guess 2: T was guessed at position 5 and marked \'-\' meaning there is at least one T but position 5 is wrong. However, that doesn\'t rule out a second T. Similarly, in Guess 3, T at position 3 is ✓, so that might be the only T? Or there could be more? The rules don\'t specify, but typically, if there is a duplicate, we might see additional feedback? But in Wordle, if a letter appears twice in the guess but only once in the secret word, one might be marked correctly or present, and the other absent? But I think we have to be cautious.\n\nHowever, since the feedback for Guess 2: T at pos 5 was \'-\', that implies there is at least one T in the word (which we now know is at position 3), so if there were a second T, it might have been marked? But not necessarily—if the secret has only one T and we guessed it at pos 5 incorrectly, and in Guess 3 we guessed it correctly at pos 3, then we have one T.\n\nTo avoid complexity, we should assume that T appears only once? But not required.\n\nSimilarly, for Guess 1: A was present but in wrong position, now we know it\'s in pos 2.\n\nNow for Guess 4, we are limited by the known pattern: _ A T _ _\n\nAnd we need to fill the blanks.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BATTY"" → B,A,T,T,Y → But positions: B1, A2, T3, T4, Y5. So fourth letter is T? But T is already in position 3? If the word has two T\'s? But ""BATTY"" is valid, but then we have T at position 4? But we don\'t know that.\n\nWe should consider that maybe the word has repeated letters? But let\'s list without repetition first.\n\nCommon words without repeated letters: \n- ""MATTE"" → but E is absent? Disallowed.\n\n""CATAL"" not a word.\n\n""RATIO"" has R? Disallowed.\n\n""DATUM"" → D,A,T,U,M → positions: D1, A2, T3, U4, M5. All distinct? Yes, and letters: D,U,M are acceptable? Absent: C,R,N,E,L,O,F,P,H,S. So D, U, M are available.\n\nIs ""DATUM"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a piece of data.\n\nAnother: ""FATAL"" but L? Absent? Disallowed.\n\n""BATIK"" → B,A,T,I,K → positions: B1, A2, T3, I4, K5. Valid word.\n\n""BATON"" but N? Absent? Disallowed.\n\n""WATTY"" → W,A,T,T,Y? Duplicate T.\n\n""MATCH"" has C and H? Disallowed.\n\n""PATCH"" has P and H? Disallowed.\n\nSo ""BATIK"" and ""DATUM"" are options.\n\nBut let\'s consider the most common letters: We might want to test frequent consonants like D, B, M, etc.\n\nAnother option: ""BALMY"" but L? Disallowed.\n\n""GATED"" has E? Disallowed.\n\n""HAVOC"" has H and C? Disallowed.\n\nSo perhaps ""BATIK"" or ""DATUM"".\n\nBut we also have ""YETI"" not 5 letters.\n\nWe need to cover multiple possibilities.\n\nSince we have three unknowns, we can try a word like ""DIATS"" not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""JATOS"" but J? Or not common.\n\nI think ""BATIK"" is a valid option: B, I, K are untested letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""DATUM"" tests D, U, M.\n\nWhich one to choose? Both use unique letters and are valid.\n\nSince ""BATIK"" uses letters like I and K which are common? Perhaps.\n\nBut we might want to prioritize covering vowels? Or consonants?\n\nThe secret word might have a vowel at position 4 or 5? Currently, positions: 1,4,5 are consonants? Not necessarily.\n\nIn ""BATIK"": position 4 is I (vowel), position 5 is K (consonant).\n\nIn ""DATUM"": position 4 is U (vowel), position 5 M (consonant).\n\nBoth have a vowel at position 4? But we don\'t know.\n\nWe can also consider words that end with vowels? But English words usually don\'t.\n\nAnother common word: ""LATTE"" has E? Disallowed.\n\n""MATCH"" invalid.\n\n""PATCH"" invalid.\n\n""WATCH"" has H? Disallowed.\n\n""PATTY"" has P and T twice? Disallowed.\n\nSo ""BATIK"" seems good.\n\nBut let\'s check if the letter I or U has been used? No, we haven\'t used them.\n\nWe could try ""BAITH"" not valid.\n\nSo I\'ll choose ""DATUM"" because it uses U and M, which are common enough.\n\nBut let\'s see: in Guess 3, we tested S and it was absent? So cannot use S.\n\nSo word: DATUM → D-A-T-U-M\n\nBut D, U, M are new.\n\nSimilarly, B in ""BATIK"" is new.\n\nBut to narrow it down faster, we might pick a word that uses letters that are more frequent.\n\nEnglish letters frequency: D is more frequent than B? Actually, S, D, T are common? But S is absent? We know S is absent.\n\nD is the 7th most common letter, B is 15th? I think B is more common than U and M? But we can use either.\n\nGiven that there might be limited possibilities, let\'s list all possible words? But we don\'t have a full dictionary.\n\nPerhaps start with B: BAT words? ""BATED"" has E? Disallowed. ""BATES"" has E and S? Disallowed. ""BATIK"" as above.\n\nSimilarly for D: ""DATED"" has E? Disallowed. ""DATA"" is 4 letters? ""DATTO"" not common. ""DATUM"" valid.\n\nFor G: ""GATOR"" has R? Disallowed. ""GATTY"" duplicate T? ""GATAL"" not valid.\n\nFor H: absent? Disallowed.\n\nFor I: impossible as first letter? ""I"" words: ""ATTIC"" but A and T fixed? But our pattern is _ A T _ _, so ""IATRY"" not common.\n\nFor K: ""KATAS"" but S? Disallowed. ""KATER"" E and R.\n\nFor M: ""MATCH"" invalid? ""MATTE"" E. ""MATTS"" has S? Disallowed.\n\nSo limited.\n\nTherefore, good candidates: ""BATIK"", ""DATUM"".\n\nBut we have another option: ""WATAP"" not common? ""WATT"" no.\n\n""VAPID"" but P? Disallowed? P is absent per Guess 3.\n\nSo no.\n\nAnother word: ""QAIDS"" not A-T? Pattern.\n\nPossible: ""JATAM"" not common? ""ZATIS"" not common? Unlikely.\n\nSo ""BATIK"" and ""DATUM"" are reasonable.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid E, etc.\n\nAnother word: ""TAMED"" but E? Disallowed.\n\n""CABBY"" but C? Disallowed.\n\nSo let\'s pick ""BATIK"".\n\nBut we know that in Guess 2 and 3, T was used at different positions, but now we have the pattern fixed.\n\nPerhaps ""BAITH"" not valid? Or ""YATRA"" — Y,A,T,R,A? R absent? Disallowed.\n\n""FAITH"" F? Absent? Disallowed?

It tests B in position 1, I in position 4, and K in position 5.\n\nIf ""BATIK"" is incorrect, the feedback will reveal details about B, I, and K, narrowing down the possibilities significantly (e.g., if B is correct/present, etc.).\n\n<guess>batik</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: aloft -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(x) O(x) F(x) T(-)\nGuess 3: paths -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) T(✓) H(x) S(x)\nGuess 4: batik -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) T(✓) I(x) K(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
  - Absent: C, R, N, E
  - Present but wrong position: A (not in pos 3)

Guess 2: ALOFT → A(-), L(x), O(x), F(x), T(-)
  - Absent: L, O, F
  - Present but wrong position: A (not in pos 1), T (not in pos 5)

Guess 3: PATHS → P(x), A(✓), T(✓), H(x), S(x)
  - Correct: A in position 2, T in position 3
  - Absent: P, H, S
  - Therefore, we know the word is _ A T _ _

Guess 4: BATIK → B(x), A(✓), T(✓), I(x), K(x)
  - Correct: A in position 2, T in position 3
  - Absent: B, I, K

Now, summarizing all absent letters: C, R, N, E, L, O, F, P, H, S, B, I, K

That means the following letters are NOT in the word: B, C, E, F, H, I, K, L, N, O, P, R, S

We also know the secret word is _ A T _ _

Available letters: remaining letters from the alphabet. Let's list all English letters and remove the absent ones.

Alphabet: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Absent: B, C, E, F, H, I, K, L, N, O, P, R, S

So available: A, D, G, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and T is already used in position 3, but could potentially be duplicated? But let's note: we don't know if T can be duplicated. However, in Guess 4, we didn't get any new T feedback because T in position 3 is correct, so if there were another T, it might not be relevant? But actually, in Guess 4, the word had T only in position 3? BATIK has T at pos 3? Yes.

But the secret word has T at position 3, so any T elsewhere would be extra? But we don't know.

Similarly, A is at position 2.

So for positions 1,4,5: we must use letters from: D, G, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly duplicated A or T? But A is at pos2, so if we use A at, say, pos5, it might be duplicated? Similarly for T at pos5? But that's possible.)

But since we are guessing letters, and avoiding the absent ones.

Now, we know the word must have at least three different letters? But not necessarily — but since A and T are fixed, positions 1,4,5 are unknown.

But we have to use the available letters.

Possible words: we need English words of the form ? A T ? ? using letters from the available set, except for A and T which are already placed.

So positions:
1: must be one of D, G, J, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and note A and T are already used, but we can duplicate? But the absent list doesn't include them? Absent are the ones listed. But we know A and T are present, so duplicates might be possible? But let's be cautious. Actually, the absent letters are not in the word at all? So only the available letters can be used? Including duplication? But duplication of A or T is possible? For example, a word with two A's? Or two T's? Because in Guess 1, we had A in the word but wrong position, now we have it fixed? Similarly for T.

But in Guess 4, we learned that B, I, K are absent? So if we used A at position 4 or 5? We can? Because A is not absent? Similarly with T? But T is not absent.

Possible letters for positions 1,4,5: from the set {D, G, J, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}? But A and T are also possible? But A and T are already known to be in the word? So for duplications? We don't know if the word has duplicates.

But since A and T are confirmed present, and we are guessing other positions, we can potentially use A or T at positions 1,4,5? But note:
Position 1: if we use A, that would be duplication? Because we already have A at position 2? Similarly for T at position 1? But position 1 can't be T? Because positions: secret word _ A T _ _ so position 1 is different from position 3? T at position 1? Then the word would be T A T _ _? Which is possible? T at position 1 and position 3? Similarly, A at position 1? Then A at position1 and position2: A at position1 and position2? Then word A A T _ _, like ""AATTR"" not common? But possible?

However, let's see what common English words fit.

First, position 1: we can use D, G, J, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since B,C,E,F,H,I,K,L,N,O,P,R,S are absent).

And positions 4 and 5: from the same set? Or including duplicated A or T? But A and T are already present, so duplication might be marked as present? But let's see.

Let me list possible 5-letter words ending with AT? Or starting with ?AT.

Common ones:

- ""DATEY"" not common? ""DATE"" ends with E? Absent.
- ""MATS"" not 5 letters? Hard.

Since A is at position2 and T at3, common words: like ""WATER"" but E and R? Absent? Disallowed.
- ""HATER"" H absent? Disallowed.
- ""LATER"" L absent? Disallowed.
- ""MATER"" M? But M available? ""MATER"" means mother? But also has E? E absent? Disallowed? Positions: let's spell: M A T E R? But E and R absent? So no.

Not working? So let's consider less common words.

Another one: ""DATA"" ends with A? But 4 letters? ""DATA"" is 4? Or ""DATAS""? S absent? Disallowed.

Perhaps words like ""DATIVE""? Too long? Dative is 6 letters.

5-letter words? ""BATTY"" but B absent? Disallowed by Guess 4.

After Guess 4, B is absent? So no.

""CATTY"" C absent? No.

""MATTE"" E absent.

But what about ""MATZA"" — M A T Z A? But that's M in pos1, Z in pos4, A in pos5? Is ""MATZA"" a word? Yes, meaning unleavened bread? But that's MATZO? Typically? MATZA is 5 letters? Sometime?

But MATZA: M-A-T-Z-A? Positions: M1, A2, T3, Z4, A5? With A duplicated? So A at pos5? We know A is present? How does it get marked? But let's see: in previous guesses, if we guessed a duplicate A? But we didn't, so we don't know.

But actually, the word ""MATSA"" or something? Not sure.

Valid words? ""TATER"" T and E? Not.

Let's list actual possibilities.

Given the pattern _ A T _ _ and the constraints:

Position 1: D, G, J, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? Actually, available letters: D, G, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But Q is available? But not common.

Possible words:

- With U: ""UATEN"" not word? ""UATYA"" not? 
- With V: ""VATIC"" C? Disallowed? ""VATEL"" L? Disallowed? ""VATOS"" S? Disallowed.
- With W: ""WATAP"" not common? ""WATAN"" N? Absent? Disallowed? N absent.
- With Y: ""YATRA"" R? Disallowed? ""YATTA"" T? Duplicate T? That's possible? Y A T T A? Then positions: Y1, A2, T3, T4, A5? But T at pos4? And A at pos5? But R disallowed? YATRA? Y A T R A? R absent? So no.

But consider duplication?

Another one: ""MAAIA""? Not word? ""MAATI"" not? 

Perhaps:

- ""DATUM"": D A T U M? Positions: D1, A2, T3, U4, M5? But U4 and M5? Letters D,U,M available? Absent: none? D, U, M not absent? And all are in available letters? Available: A,T plus D,U,M? Yes? So word: DATA? No? ""DATUM"" is 5 letters? Yes? Meaning a piece of data? Also, pattern _ A T _ _ fits? Absolutely.

Similarly, we have ""GAMMA"" G A M M A? But M duplicated? And A duplicated? But in our constraints? Absent: G is available? And M available? But let's see: GAMMA is G1, A2, M3, M4, A5? But our pattern requires T at position 3? So must have A2 T3, so position 3 must be T? Therefore, ""GAMMA"" has position 3 M? Not T? So doesn't match pattern? Must have T at pos3? So ""GATAY"" not word? ""GATOR"" has R? Disallowed.

So ""DATUM"" is one possible word? Because it matches D A T U M? So pattern: _ A T U M? With positions: 1: D, 4: U, 5: M? All letters available.

Another word: ""MATZA"" or ""MATZAH"" too long? Maybe not valid 5-letter.

Another: ""VATUR"" not common? Or ""WATUM"" not word.

With J: ""JATOS"" J A T O S? O and S absent? Disallowed? O absent.

Or ""JATTI"" I? I absent? Disallowed? I is absent from Guess 4.

Available letters without absent: D, G, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But what about Q? Q often followed by U? But not necessarily? ""QATAL"" not word? 

U: ""UATOM"" not? 

Possible words: ""DATUM"" as above? And also ""MATEY""? E absent? Disallowed? M A T E Y? E absent? So no.

""DATE"" not 5 letters? 

""FATLY"" F absent? Disallowed? 

So another option: ""GAUZY"" G A U Z Y? But pattern: G1 A2 => position 3 should be T? Here it's U? Not T? Doesn't work? Must be T at pos3? So only position 1,4,5 free? And must have T at pos3? So only? So words with pattern ? A T ? ?

So ""XATKA"" not common? Or ""MATZO"" O absent? Disallowed? 

Another word: ""DOTAL"" L absent? Disallowed? 

Perhaps ""DAYT""? Not 5 letters? 

I think ""DATUM"" is one candidate? And also ""GATUM"" not word? 

What about ""WATTMAN""? Too many letters? 

Perhaps duplication: let's allow duplicated A? For example: ""DATA"" is 4 letters? 

But we can try ""AATMA"" not English? 

Another English word: ""TAATA"" not? 

Or possibly ""MAATI"" not standard? 

So what about ""BATTED""? E disallowed? 

Therefore, ""DATUM"" seems a strong candidate? But let's not forget, position 1 could be M? Like ""MATRIX"" not? 

""MADID"" M A D I D? But pattern must be T at pos3? So M A T ? ? 

So ""MATS"" not? 

So for pattern M A T ? ?: ""MATCH"" C? Disallowed? ""MATES"" E and S? Disallowed? ""MATTE"" E? Disallowed? ""MATTS"" S? Disallowed? ""MATZA""?
- ""MATZA"" : M A T Z A? Positions: M1, A2, T3, Z4, A5? So with A duplicated? And Z4? All letters: M available, A and T known, Z available? So possible? And ""MATZA"" may refer to MATZO? But often MATZO is 5 letters? Yes? Or MATZA? Same thing? Uncommon? But valid? 

So two candidates: ""DATUM"" and ""MATZA""?

But ""MATZA"" has A twice? And Z? 

Also, ""VATTA"" V A T T A? Positions: V1, A2, T3, T4, A5? T duplicated? That's V,A,T,T,A? So pattern? T at pos3 and pos4? Not impossible? ""VATTA"" is a word? Meaning a braid? Or not common? 

But we can test.

However, in our guess, we cannot test both? So we need to choose one.

Another candidate: ""JATOS"" J A T O S? O absent? Disallowed? No? O is absent? Per Guess 2.

So no.

""UATCH"" C? Disallowed? 

Therefore, possible words include:
- DATUM: D1, A2, T3, U4, M5
- MATZA: M1, A2, T3, Z4, A5
- VATTA: V1, A2, T3, T4, A5? With T duplicated? And V available? 
- or GATAL? Not valid? 

Perhaps ""QATSA"" Q A T S A? S absent? Disallowed.

So the only realistic commonish words? DATUM and MATZA? 

But note: MATZA might be spelled with O? No? MATZA is an alternative spelling? 

Also, ""YATTY"" but T duplicated? And Y? Y1, A2, T3, T4, Y5? But ""YATTY"" not common.

Another: ""ZATAM"" not word? 

I think DATUM is the best choice? But let me confirm: the feedback must have been consistent? Since we never tested duplication? 

For Guess 4: BATIK → feedback: B(x) A(✓) T(✓) I(x) K(x)? So duplications weren't tested? 

So I'll go with ""DATUM"" for Guess 5? 

But it has U and M? Which haven't been used? So we test U and M? 

Alternatively, MATZA tests Z? 

Both are fine? 

But DATUM uses more common letters? U is more common than Z? 

So Guess 5: DATUM? 

But let's make it? 

If it's wrong? We get clues? But we have tries left? 

We have two tries left? Since Guess 4 was fourth? So two more? 

So guess DATUM? 

Pattern: D A T U M

If correct? Win? 

If not, learn if D, U, M are in the word? 

But D at pos1? U at pos4? M at pos5? 

So let's do it? 

So the guess is DATUM? 

In the response format? 

But let's see? 

Another possibility? What about ""MADAM""? M A D A M? Pattern: M1 A2? Then position3 should be T? But we have D? So not T? Invalid? 

Must have T at position 3? 

So only DATUM and MATZA in my list? 

So I think DATUM is fine? 

So <guess>datum</guess>? 

But let's write? 

Actually, I think we should guess DATUM.
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Pattern Confirmed**: The secret word is formatted as `_ A T _ _` (A in position 2, T in position 3).
- **Absent Letters**: B, C, E, F, H, I, K, L, N, O, P, R, S (from cumulative feedback).
- **Available Letters**: D, G, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and potentially duplicated A or T, though unlikely).
- **Key Insight**: The missing positions (1, 4, 5) must use letters from the available set. Common English words fitting this pattern are scarce due to constraints.

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- Prioritize **common letters** from the available set (e.g., D, M, U) to test frequent possibilities.
- **Efficiency**: With only 2 guesses left, choose a word that:
  - Uses untested letters to maximize new information (e.g., D, U, M).
  - Avoids improbable duplicates unless necessary (e.g., no evidence of repeated A or T).
- **Selected Word**: **""DATUM""** (`D A T U M`):
  - Tests D (position 1), U (position 4), M (position 5).
  - Letters D, U, and M are highly plausible for common English words.
  - Valid word meaning ""a piece of data"".

If incorrect, feedback will clarify D, U, and M, allowing a final guess.

<guess>datum</guess>",datum,"We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
  - Absent: C, R, N, E
  - Present but wrong position: A (not in pos 3)

Guess 2: ALOFT → A(-), L(x), O(x), F(x), T(-)
  - Absent: L, O, F
  - Present but wrong position: A (not in pos 1), T (not in pos 5)

Guess 3: PATHS → P(x), A(✓), T(✓), H(x), S(x)
  - Correct: A in position 2, T in position 3
  - Absent: P, H, S
  - Therefore, we know the word is _ A T _ _

Guess 4: BATIK → B(x), A(✓), T(✓), I(x), K(x)
  - Correct: A in position 2, T in position 3
  - Absent: B, I, K

Now, summarizing all absent letters: C, R, N, E, L, O, F, P, H, S, B, I, K

That means the following letters are NOT in the word: B, C, E, F, H, I, K, L, N, O, P, R, S

We also know the secret word is _ A T _ _

Available letters: remaining letters from the alphabet. Let's list all English letters and remove the absent ones.

Alphabet: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Absent: B, C, E, F, H, I, K, L, N, O, P, R, S

So available: A, D, G, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and T is already used in position 3, but could potentially be duplicated? But let's note: we don't know if T can be duplicated. However, in Guess 4, we didn't get any new T feedback because T in position 3 is correct, so if there were another T, it might not be relevant? But actually, in Guess 4, the word had T only in position 3? BATIK has T at pos 3? Yes.

But the secret word has T at position 3, so any T elsewhere would be extra? But we don't know.

Similarly, A is at position 2.

So for positions 1,4,5: we must use letters from: D, G, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly duplicated A or T? But A is at pos2, so if we use A at, say, pos5, it might be duplicated? Similarly for T at pos5? But that's possible.)

But since we are guessing letters, and avoiding the absent ones.

Now, we know the word must have at least three different letters? But not necessarily — but since A and T are fixed, positions 1,4,5 are unknown.

But we have to use the available letters.

Possible words: we need English words of the form ? A T ? ? using letters from the available set, except for A and T which are already placed.

So positions:
1: must be one of D, G, J, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and note A and T are already used, but we can duplicate? But the absent list doesn't include them? Absent are the ones listed. But we know A and T are present, so duplicates might be possible? But let's be cautious. Actually, the absent letters are not in the word at all? So only the available letters can be used? Including duplication? But duplication of A or T is possible? For example, a word with two A's? Or two T's? Because in Guess 1, we had A in the word but wrong position, now we have it fixed? Similarly for T.

But in Guess 4, we learned that B, I, K are absent? So if we used A at position 4 or 5? We can? Because A is not absent? Similarly with T? But T is not absent.

Possible letters for positions 1,4,5: from the set {D, G, J, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}? But A and T are also possible? But A and T are already known to be in the word? So for duplications? We don't know if the word has duplicates.

But since A and T are confirmed present, and we are guessing other positions, we can potentially use A or T at positions 1,4,5? But note:
Position 1: if we use A, that would be duplication? Because we already have A at position 2? Similarly for T at position 1? But position 1 can't be T? Because positions: secret word _ A T _ _ so position 1 is different from position 3? T at position 1? Then the word would be T A T _ _? Which is possible? T at position 1 and position 3? Similarly, A at position 1? Then A at position1 and position2: A at position1 and position2? Then word A A T _ _, like ""AATTR"" not common? But possible?

However, let's see what common English words fit.

First, position 1: we can use D, G, J, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since B,C,E,F,H,I,K,L,N,O,P,R,S are absent).

And positions 4 and 5: from the same set? Or including duplicated A or T? But A and T are already present, so duplication might be marked as present? But let's see.

Let me list possible 5-letter words ending with AT? Or starting with ?AT.

Common ones:

- ""DATEY"" not common? ""DATE"" ends with E? Absent.
- ""MATS"" not 5 letters? Hard.

Since A is at position2 and T at3, common words: like ""WATER"" but E and R? Absent? Disallowed.
- ""HATER"" H absent? Disallowed.
- ""LATER"" L absent? Disallowed.
- ""MATER"" M? But M available? ""MATER"" means mother? But also has E? E absent? Disallowed? Positions: let's spell: M A T E R? But E and R absent? So no.

Not working? So let's consider less common words.

Another one: ""DATA"" ends with A? But 4 letters? ""DATA"" is 4? Or ""DATAS""? S absent? Disallowed.

Perhaps words like ""DATIVE""? Too long? Dative is 6 letters.

5-letter words? ""BATTY"" but B absent? Disallowed by Guess 4.

After Guess 4, B is absent? So no.

""CATTY"" C absent? No.

""MATTE"" E absent.

But what about ""MATZA"" — M A T Z A? But that's M in pos1, Z in pos4, A in pos5? Is ""MATZA"" a word? Yes, meaning unleavened bread? But that's MATZO? Typically? MATZA is 5 letters? Sometime?

But MATZA: M-A-T-Z-A? Positions: M1, A2, T3, Z4, A5? With A duplicated? So A at pos5? We know A is present? How does it get marked? But let's see: in previous guesses, if we guessed a duplicate A? But we didn't, so we don't know.

But actually, the word ""MATSA"" or something? Not sure.

Valid words? ""TATER"" T and E? Not.

Let's list actual possibilities.

Given the pattern _ A T _ _ and the constraints:

Position 1: D, G, J, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? Actually, available letters: D, G, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But Q is available? But not common.

Possible words:

- With U: ""UATEN"" not word? ""UATYA"" not? 
- With V: ""VATIC"" C? Disallowed? ""VATEL"" L? Disallowed? ""VATOS"" S? Disallowed.
- With W: ""WATAP"" not common? ""WATAN"" N? Absent? Disallowed? N absent.
- With Y: ""YATRA"" R? Disallowed? ""YATTA"" T? Duplicate T? That's possible? Y A T T A? Then positions: Y1, A2, T3, T4, A5? But T at pos4? And A at pos5? But R disallowed? YATRA? Y A T R A? R absent? So no.

But consider duplication?

Another one: ""MAAIA""? Not word? ""MAATI"" not? 

Perhaps:

- ""DATUM"": D A T U M? Positions: D1, A2, T3, U4, M5? But U4 and M5? Letters D,U,M available? Absent: none? D, U, M not absent? And all are in available letters? Available: A,T plus D,U,M? Yes? So word: DATA? No? ""DATUM"" is 5 letters? Yes? Meaning a piece of data? Also, pattern _ A T _ _ fits? Absolutely.

Similarly, we have ""GAMMA"" G A M M A? But M duplicated? And A duplicated? But in our constraints? Absent: G is available? And M available? But let's see: GAMMA is G1, A2, M3, M4, A5? But our pattern requires T at position 3? So must have A2 T3, so position 3 must be T? Therefore, ""GAMMA"" has position 3 M? Not T? So doesn't match pattern? Must have T at pos3? So ""GATAY"" not word? ""GATOR"" has R? Disallowed.

So ""DATUM"" is one possible word? Because it matches D A T U M? So pattern: _ A T U M? With positions: 1: D, 4: U, 5: M? All letters available.

Another word: ""MATZA"" or ""MATZAH"" too long? Maybe not valid 5-letter.

Another: ""VATUR"" not common? Or ""WATUM"" not word.

With J: ""JATOS"" J A T O S? O and S absent? Disallowed? O absent.

Or ""JATTI"" I? I absent? Disallowed? I is absent from Guess 4.

Available letters without absent: D, G, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But what about Q? Q often followed by U? But not necessarily? ""QATAL"" not word? 

U: ""UATOM"" not? 

Possible words: ""DATUM"" as above? And also ""MATEY""? E absent? Disallowed? M A T E Y? E absent? So no.

""DATE"" not 5 letters? 

""FATLY"" F absent? Disallowed? 

So another option: ""GAUZY"" G A U Z Y? But pattern: G1 A2 => position 3 should be T? Here it's U? Not T? Doesn't work? Must be T at pos3? So only position 1,4,5 free? And must have T at pos3? So only? So words with pattern ? A T ? ?

So ""XATKA"" not common? Or ""MATZO"" O absent? Disallowed? 

Another word: ""DOTAL"" L absent? Disallowed? 

Perhaps ""DAYT""? Not 5 letters? 

I think ""DATUM"" is one candidate? And also ""GATUM"" not word? 

What about ""WATTMAN""? Too many letters? 

Perhaps duplication: let's allow duplicated A? For example: ""DATA"" is 4 letters? 

But we can try ""AATMA"" not English? 

Another English word: ""TAATA"" not? 

Or possibly ""MAATI"" not standard? 

So what about ""BATTED""? E disallowed? 

Therefore, ""DATUM"" seems a strong candidate? But let's not forget, position 1 could be M? Like ""MATRIX"" not? 

""MADID"" M A D I D? But pattern must be T at pos3? So M A T ? ? 

So ""MATS"" not? 

So for pattern M A T ? ?: ""MATCH"" C? Disallowed? ""MATES"" E and S? Disallowed? ""MATTE"" E? Disallowed? ""MATTS"" S? Disallowed? ""MATZA""?
- ""MATZA"" : M A T Z A? Positions: M1, A2, T3, Z4, A5? So with A duplicated? And Z4? All letters: M available, A and T known, Z available? So possible? And ""MATZA"" may refer to MATZO? But often MATZO is 5 letters? Yes? Or MATZA? Same thing? Uncommon? But valid? 

So two candidates: ""DATUM"" and ""MATZA""?

But ""MATZA"" has A twice? And Z? 

Also, ""VATTA"" V A T T A? Positions: V1, A2, T3, T4, A5? T duplicated? That's V,A,T,T,A? So pattern? T at pos3 and pos4? Not impossible? ""VATTA"" is a word? Meaning a braid? Or not common? 

But we can test.

However, in our guess, we cannot test both? So we need to choose one.

Another candidate: ""JATOS"" J A T O S? O absent? Disallowed? No? O is absent? Per Guess 2.

So no.

""UATCH"" C? Disallowed? 

Therefore, possible words include:
- DATUM: D1, A2, T3, U4, M5
- MATZA: M1, A2, T3, Z4, A5
- VATTA: V1, A2, T3, T4, A5? With T duplicated? And V available? 
- or GATAL? Not valid? 

Perhaps ""QATSA"" Q A T S A? S absent? Disallowed.

So the only realistic commonish words? DATUM and MATZA? 

But note: MATZA might be spelled with O? No? MATZA is an alternative spelling? 

Also, ""YATTY"" but T duplicated? And Y? Y1, A2, T3, T4, Y5? But ""YATTY"" not common.

Another: ""ZATAM"" not word? 

I think DATUM is the best choice? But let me confirm: the feedback must have been consistent? Since we never tested duplication? 

For Guess 4: BATIK → feedback: B(x) A(✓) T(✓) I(x) K(x)? So duplications weren't tested? 

So I'll go with ""DATUM"" for Guess 5? 

But it has U and M? Which haven't been used? So we test U and M? 

Alternatively, MATZA tests Z? 

Both are fine? 

But DATUM uses more common letters? U is more common than Z? 

So Guess 5: DATUM? 

But let's make it? 

If it's wrong? We get clues? But we have tries left? 

We have two tries left? Since Guess 4 was fourth? So two more? 

So guess DATUM? 

Pattern: D A T U M

If correct? Win? 

If not, learn if D, U, M are in the word? 

But D at pos1? U at pos4? M at pos5? 

So let's do it? 

So the guess is DATUM? 

In the response format? 

But let's see? 

Another possibility? What about ""MADAM""? M A D A M? Pattern: M1 A2? Then position3 should be T? But we have D? So not T? Invalid? 

Must have T at position 3? 

So only DATUM and MATZA in my list? 

So I think DATUM is fine? 

So <guess>datum</guess>? 

But let's write? 

Actually, I think we should guess DATUM.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Pattern Confirmed**: The secret word is formatted as `_ A T _ _` (A in position 2, T in position 3).
- **Absent Letters**: B, C, E, F, H, I, K, L, N, O, P, R, S (from cumulative feedback).
- **Available Letters**: D, G, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and potentially duplicated A or T, though unlikely).
- **Key Insight**: The missing positions (1, 4, 5) must use letters from the available set. Common English words fitting this pattern are scarce due to constraints.

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- Prioritize **common letters** from the available set (e.g., D, M, U) to test frequent possibilities.
- **Efficiency**: With only 2 guesses left, choose a word that:
  - Uses untested letters to maximize new information (e.g., D, U, M).
  - Avoids improbable duplicates unless necessary (e.g., no evidence of repeated A or T).
- **Selected Word**: **""DATUM""** (`D A T U M`):
  - Tests D (position 1), U (position 4), M (position 5).
  - Letters D, U, and M are highly plausible for common English words.
  - Valid word meaning ""a piece of data"".

If incorrect, feedback will clarify D, U, and M, allowing a final guess.",Guess 5: datum -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) A(✓) T(✓) U(✓) M(✓),SUCCESS
