- No repeated letters, to cover more distinct letters.

One popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it has two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (S, L, T). Another is ""CRANE"". Alternatively, ""ROATE"" or ""RAISE"" are also used.

I think I'll choose ""CRANE"". Let me check:

We start with the initial guess ""crane"" and the feedback was: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
 This means:
   - The letter E is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5, since it's the last letter).
   - The letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word:
   - Ends with E (so it must be in the form ????E)
   - Does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 We have 6 tries total and this is the second try.

 Now we need to select a new 5-letter word that meets these conditions and helps us get more information.

 Constraints:
   - The fifth letter must be E.
   - The word cannot contain C, R, A, or N.

 We can also note that we have eliminated those four letters, so we should avoid them.

 Since E is fixed at the end, we only need to guess the first four letters. We want to include other common letters to test for presence.

 Common letters that are not yet tested (and not eliminated): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Considering common vowels: We know A is eliminated, so we have O, U, I that are vowels. Since E is already confirmed at the end, we may want to test another vowel in a different position? But note: E might also appear elsewhere? However, we don't know yet.

 Actually, E being at the end does not preclude it from appearing elsewhere? But from the feedback in the first guess, we had only one E in the fifth position and it was correct. We don't know if there are more E's. However, in the first guess, we had only one E (at the end), so if the secret word had another E, it might have been indicated. But wait, our first guess was ""crane"", which has E only at the end? Let me confirm: crane -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E. So if the secret word had an E in another position, say position 2, then in our guess we would have had a '-' for R if that position were E? But no, we got R(x) meaning R is not in the word. Similarly, we didn't get any '-' for E elsewhere because we didn't have E elsewhere in the guess.

 Important: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we didn't guess E anywhere else, we don't know about other E's. However, we have to assume that the E we have is the only E until we see evidence otherwise? But we cannot rule out multiple E's.

 However, since we have E at the end fixed, and the word has 5 letters, we can try to have E only at the end for now to avoid complicating the feedback? Actually, it might be beneficial to test for E in other positions? But we have limited tries.

 Alternatively, we can focus on testing other common letters.

 Let me think: we need a word that ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, N.

 Potential words:
   - Words ending in E: many, such as ""house"", but house has S which is common? Also, ""guide"", ""alive"", but A is eliminated -> not possible.

 So, avoid A, C, R, N.

 Consider words: I can use S, T, L, O, P, M, etc.

 Common words: ""SLATE"" -> but S, L, A, T, E -> but A is eliminated? Yes, we cannot use A. So not SLATE.

 Another: ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E -> does not have A, C, R, N? Yes.

 But note: We don't know if the word has S, P, I, T.

 However, we also want to cover letters that are frequent. Let me see: S, T, P are very common.

 Another popular word might be ""QUITE"", but Q is less common.

 Also, ""SPINE"" -> but N is eliminated? We cannot use N. Yes, N is eliminated.

 So, ""SPITE"" avoids A, C, R, N.

 What about ""SHINE""? H but then N is eliminated -> not possible.

 Or ""SLIME"": S, L, I, M, E -> avoids A, C, R, N? Yes.

 We have two options: SPITE or SLIME.

 How about testing additional vowels? ""SPITE"" has I, which is a vowel. ""SLIME"" has I as well.

 Alternatively, we might test O? Then consider ""SMOTE"": S, M, O, T, E -> works? M and O.

 But SMOTE is a valid word? Yes, meaning to kill.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: SPITE -> letters: S, P, I, T, E (we get information on S, P, I, T in positions 1,2,3,4 and E at end we know already)

 Option 2: SLIME: S, L, I, M, E -> gives S, L, I, M.

 Option 3: SMOTE: S, M, O, T, E -> gives S, M, O, T.

 Which one is better? We probably want to maximize the frequency of letters we are testing.

 Frequency of letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ...

 But we know A and N and R are out. So common remaining: T, O, I, S, H, D, L, ...

 So, SPITE: Includes S (common), P (not as common), I (common), T (common). 
 SLIME: Includes S, L (common), I, M (less common).
 SMOTE: Includes S, M, O (common), T.

 Another word: ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E -> avoids eliminated letters? Yes. Then we get S, T, O, L.

 STOLE: S (common), T (common), O (common), L (common). This seems better because we test more common letters.

 Also, ""STOLE"" is a common word.

 What about ""SPOLE""? Not a common word.

 So, between STOLE and SPITE and SLIME, STOLE tests more common letters: S, T, O, L.

 Alternatively, ""SHOLE"" - not common.

 Another: ""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes, and Y is sometimes common.

 But STOLE seems like a good candidate.

 We have O, which is a vowel we haven't tried yet? In the first guess we only had A and E? A is eliminated.

 So, STOLE: 
   Position1: S
   Position2: T
   Position3: O
   Position4: L
   Position5: E (fixed)

 This tests S, T, O, L.

 Another candidate: ""HOUSE"" - but H, O, U, S, E -> U is also a vowel? Unfortunately, we have to avoid A but U is fine. However, we don't know if U is common? And we haven't tested U. But we also have O and S and H.

 However, note we don't have information about H, so testing H is good? 

 Comparing House and Stole: 
   House: H, O, U, S, E -> letters H, O, U, S -> H and U are not as common as T and L? But H is common, U less so.

 But STOLE gives T and L which are more common than H and U? 

 Actually, T is more common than H? Indeed, T is the second most common letter in English after E.

 So STOLE seems better.

 One more: ""POISE"" - P, O, I, S, E -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes, and we get P, O, I, S. Then we test I and O (vowels) and S and P.

 But again, P is less common than T in English? Yes.

 Having looked at these, I think STOLE is a strong candidate.

 But note: we also need to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We have eliminated E at position 5, but E might appear elsewhere? However, we don't have information about other E's.

 In STOLE, we are putting E at the end (which we know is correct) so no conflict.

 So, I'll go with ""STOLE"".

 Guess: stole

 However, let me double-check: STOLE does not contain C, R, A, N? 
   S: ok, T: ok, O: ok, L: ok, E: ok.

 And it ends with E.

 So, making the guess: STOLE.
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is correct and in the **5th position** (since E got a ✓).
- C, R, A, and N are **not in the word** (all got x).

Therefore, the secret word:
- Ends with **E** (format: `_ _ _ _ E`).
- **Excludes** C, R, A, and N.

For the second guess, I prioritize:
1. Ending with **E**.
2. Using **common unused letters** (e.g., S, T, O, L, I) to test their presence/positions.
3. Avoiding eliminated letters (C, R, A, N).

A strong candidate is **STOLE**:
- Tests **S, T, O, L** (high-frequency letters not yet examined).
- Ends with **E**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (no C, R, A, N).

<guess>stole</guess>",stole,"We start with the initial guess ""crane"" and the feedback was: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)

 Option 2: SLIME: S, L, I, M, E -> gives S, L, I, M.

 Option 3: SMOTE: S, M, O, T, E -> gives S, M, O, T.

 Which one is better? We probably want to maximize the frequency of letters we are testing.

 Frequency of letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ...

 But we know A and N and R are out. So common remaining: T, O, I, S, H, D, L, ...

 So, SPITE: Includes S (common), P (not as common), I (common), T (common). 
 SLIME: Includes S, L (common), I, M (less common).
 SMOTE: Includes S, M, O (common), T.

 Another word: ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E -> avoids eliminated letters? Yes. Then we get S, T, O, L.

 STOLE: S (common), T (common), O (common), L (common). This seems better because we test more common letters.

 Also, ""STOLE"" is a common word.

 What about ""SPOLE""? Not a common word.

 So, between STOLE and SPITE and SLIME, STOLE tests more common letters: S, T, O, L.

 Alternatively, ""SHOLE"" - not common.

 Another: ""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes, and Y is sometimes common.

 But STOLE seems like a good candidate.

 We have O, which is a vowel we haven't tried yet? In the first guess we only had A and E? A is eliminated.

 So, STOLE: 
   Position1: S
   Position2: T
   Position3: O
   Position4: L
   Position5: E (fixed)

 This tests S, T, O, L.

 Another candidate: ""HOUSE"" - but H, O, U, S, E -> U is also a vowel? Unfortunately, we have to avoid A but U is fine. However, we don't know if U is common? And we haven't tested U. But we also have O and S and H.

 However, note we don't have information about H, so testing H is good? 

 Comparing House and Stole: 
   House: H, O, U, S, E -> letters H, O, U, S -> H and U are not as common as T and L? But H is common, U less so.

 But STOLE gives T and L which are more common than H and U? 

 Actually, T is more common than H? Indeed, T is the second most common letter in English after E.

 So STOLE seems better.

 One more: ""POISE"" - P, O, I, S, E -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes, and we get P, O, I, S. Then we test I and O (vowels) and S and P.

 But again, P is less common than T in English? Yes.

 Having looked at these, I think STOLE is a strong candidate.

 But note: we also need to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We have eliminated E at position 5, but E might appear elsewhere? However, we don't have information about other E's.

 In STOLE, we are putting E at the end (which we know is correct) so no conflict.

 So, I'll go with ""STOLE"".

 Guess: stole

 However, let me double-check: STOLE does not contain C, R, A, N?

 And it ends with E.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. We have to make the first guess. Since it's the first guess, we have no prior information. We need a good starting word that can reveal as much information as possible.

Commonly, good starting words have:
- Common letters: letters that appear frequently in English words (like vowels: A, E, I, O, U and common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
- No repeated letters, to cover more distinct letters.

One popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it has two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (S, L, T). Another is ""CRANE"". Alternatively, ""ROATE"" or ""RAISE"" are also used.

I think I'll choose ""CRANE"". Let me check:
- C, R, A, N, E: all are common letters.

So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".I'm starting with a common strategy: choosing a word that includes frequent letters to maximize information. The word ""CRANE"" is a good first guess because it includes:
- Two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, increasing coverage.
- Letters like E and R appear in many English words, making feedback more useful for narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We start with the initial guess ""crane"" and the feedback was: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
 This means:
   - The letter E is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5, since it's the last letter).
   - The letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word:
   - Ends with E (so it must be in the form ????E)
   - Does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 We have 6 tries total and this is the second try.

 Now we need to select a new 5-letter word that meets these conditions and helps us get more information.

 Constraints:
   - The fifth letter must be E.
   - The word cannot contain C, R, A, or N.

 We can also note that we have eliminated those four letters, so we should avoid them.

 Since E is fixed at the end, we only need to guess the first four letters. We want to include other common letters to test for presence.

 Common letters that are not yet tested (and not eliminated): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Considering common vowels: We know A is eliminated, so we have O, U, I that are vowels. Since E is already confirmed at the end, we may want to test another vowel in a different position? But note: E might also appear elsewhere? However, we don't know yet.

 Actually, E being at the end does not preclude it from appearing elsewhere? But from the feedback in the first guess, we had only one E in the fifth position and it was correct. We don't know if there are more E's. However, in the first guess, we had only one E (at the end), so if the secret word had another E, it might have been indicated. But wait, our first guess was ""crane"", which has E only at the end? Let me confirm: crane -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E. So if the secret word had an E in another position, say position 2, then in our guess we would have had a '-' for R if that position were E? But no, we got R(x) meaning R is not in the word. Similarly, we didn't get any '-' for E elsewhere because we didn't have E elsewhere in the guess.

 Important: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we didn't guess E anywhere else, we don't know about other E's. However, we have to assume that the E we have is the only E until we see evidence otherwise? But we cannot rule out multiple E's.

 However, since we have E at the end fixed, and the word has 5 letters, we can try to have E only at the end for now to avoid complicating the feedback? Actually, it might be beneficial to test for E in other positions? But we have limited tries.

 Alternatively, we can focus on testing other common letters.

 Let me think: we need a word that ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, N.

 Potential words:
   - Words ending in E: many, such as ""house"", but house has S which is common? Also, ""guide"", ""alive"", but A is eliminated -> not possible.

 So, avoid A, C, R, N.

 Consider words: I can use S, T, L, O, P, M, etc.

 Common words: ""SLATE"" -> but S, L, A, T, E -> but A is eliminated? Yes, we cannot use A. So not SLATE.

 Another: ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E -> does not have A, C, R, N? Yes.

 But note: We don't know if the word has S, P, I, T.

 However, we also want to cover letters that are frequent. Let me see: S, T, P are very common.

 Another popular word might be ""QUITE"", but Q is less common.

 Also, ""SPINE"" -> but N is eliminated? We cannot use N. Yes, N is eliminated.

 So, ""SPITE"" avoids A, C, R, N.

 What about ""SHINE""? H but then N is eliminated -> not possible.

 Or ""SLIME"": S, L, I, M, E -> avoids A, C, R, N? Yes.

 We have two options: SPITE or SLIME.

 How about testing additional vowels? ""SPITE"" has I, which is a vowel. ""SLIME"" has I as well.

 Alternatively, we might test O? Then consider ""SMOTE"": S, M, O, T, E -> works? M and O.

 But SMOTE is a valid word? Yes, meaning to kill.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: SPITE -> letters: S, P, I, T, E (we get information on S, P, I, T in positions 1,2,3,4 and E at end we know already)

 Option 2: SLIME: S, L, I, M, E -> gives S, L, I, M.

 Option 3: SMOTE: S, M, O, T, E -> gives S, M, O, T.

 Which one is better? We probably want to maximize the frequency of letters we are testing.

 Frequency of letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ...

 But we know A and N and R are out. So common remaining: T, O, I, S, H, D, L, ...

 So, SPITE: Includes S (common), P (not as common), I (common), T (common). 
 SLIME: Includes S, L (common), I, M (less common).
 SMOTE: Includes S, M, O (common), T.

 Another word: ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E -> avoids eliminated letters? Yes. Then we get S, T, O, L.

 STOLE: S (common), T (common), O (common), L (common). This seems better because we test more common letters.

 Also, ""STOLE"" is a common word.

 What about ""SPOLE""? Not a common word.

 So, between STOLE and SPITE and SLIME, STOLE tests more common letters: S, T, O, L.

 Alternatively, ""SHOLE"" - not common.

 Another: ""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes, and Y is sometimes common.

 But STOLE seems like a good candidate.

 We have O, which is a vowel we haven't tried yet? In the first guess we only had A and E? A is eliminated.

 So, STOLE: 
   Position1: S
   Position2: T
   Position3: O
   Position4: L
   Position5: E (fixed)

 This tests S, T, O, L.

 Another candidate: ""HOUSE"" - but H, O, U, S, E -> U is also a vowel? Unfortunately, we have to avoid A but U is fine. However, we don't know if U is common? And we haven't tested U. But we also have O and S and H.

 However, note we don't have information about H, so testing H is good? 

 Comparing House and Stole: 
   House: H, O, U, S, E -> letters H, O, U, S -> H and U are not as common as T and L? But H is common, U less so.

 But STOLE gives T and L which are more common than H and U? 

 Actually, T is more common than H? Indeed, T is the second most common letter in English after E.

 So STOLE seems better.

 One more: ""POISE"" - P, O, I, S, E -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes, and we get P, O, I, S. Then we test I and O (vowels) and S and P.

 But again, P is less common than T in English? Yes.

 Having looked at these, I think STOLE is a strong candidate.

 But note: we also need to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We have eliminated E at position 5, but E might appear elsewhere? However, we don't have information about other E's.

 In STOLE, we are putting E at the end (which we know is correct) so no conflict.

 So, I'll go with ""STOLE"".

 Guess: stole

 However, let me double-check: STOLE does not contain C, R, A, N? 
   S: ok, T: ok, O: ok, L: ok, E: ok.

 And it ends with E.

 So, making the guess: STOLE.After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is correct and in the **5th position** (since E got a ✓).
- C, R, A, and N are **not in the word** (all got x).

Therefore, the secret word:
- Ends with **E** (format: `_ _ _ _ E`).
- **Excludes** C, R, A, and N.

For the second guess, I prioritize:
1. Ending with **E**.
2. Using **common unused letters** (e.g., S, T, O, L, I) to test their presence/positions.
3. Avoiding eliminated letters (C, R, A, N).

A strong candidate is **STOLE**:
- Tests **S, T, O, L** (high-frequency letters not yet examined).
- Ends with **E**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (no C, R, A, N).

We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
- E is correct and in the 5th position.
- C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""stole"" -> S(✓) T(x) O(✓) L(x) E(✓)
- S is correct and in the 1st position (since it was the first letter in ""stole"", and it got ✓).
- O is correct and in the 3rd position (since it was the third letter in ""stole"", and it got ✓).
- E is correct and in the 5th position. We already knew this.
- T and L are not in the word (T(x) and L(x)).

Important deductions:
1. **Known positions**:
   - Position 1: S (from S(✓) in ""stole"")
   - Position 3: O (from O(✓) in ""stole"")
   - Position 5: E (from E(✓) in both guesses)

2. **Known absent letters**:
   - From ""crane"": C, R, A, N are absent.
   - From ""stole"": T and L are absent (since they got x).
   - So total absent: C, R, A, N, T, L.

3. **Word structure**:
   - The word is: S _ O _ E
   - We need to fill positions 2 and 4.

4. **Constraints**:
   - Letters absent: C, R, A, N, T, L.
   - So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We know the word must be a valid English word of the form S?O?E.

We must choose a word for the next guess that:
- Starts with S and ends with E (positions 1 and 5 fixed).
- Has O in position 3 (fixed).
- Does not contain T or L (absent from ""stole"") or C, R, A, N (absent from ""crane"").
- We also must avoid using letters that we know are absent.

But note: In position 2 and 4, we have to choose letters from the available set.

Additionally, we want to maximize information. So we should test letters that are common and haven't been tested yet.

Available common letters: H, I, D, M, P, U, B, G, F.

Examples of words fitting S?O?E:
- SHOPE? Not a word.
- SHORE? But R is absent (from ""crane"") -> not allowed.
- SMOLE? Not a word and L is absent.
- SOLE? Only 4 letters.
- SPOKE? P and K: K hasn't been tested. But ""spoke"": positions: S, P, O, K, E -> fits pattern. Is P and K allowed? Yes, they are in the available set.

Valid words:
- SPOKE: S, P, O, K, E -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:O, 4:K, 5:E -> should test P and K.
- SMOKE: S, M, O, K, E -> tests M and K.
- SNOKE? Not common and N is absent.
- SCOPE? C is absent -> not valid.
- SHONE: S, H, O, N, E -> but N is absent -> not allowed.
- SHINE: S, H, I, N, E -> N absent -> no.
- SHMOE? Not a word.
- SHIRE? R absent -> no.

More words:
- STOKE: S, T, O, K, E -> but T is absent -> invalid.
- SOZIE? Not common and doesn't fit.

Common words:
- ""SPOKE"" is valid.
- ""SMOKE"" is valid.
- ""SCOPE"" -> C absent -> invalid.
- ""SHOVE"": S, H, O, V, E -> tests H and V. H is common, V less so.
- ""SHOJE""? Not a word.
- ""SHOTE""? T absent -> invalid.
- ""SOWCE""? Not a word.

Also, ""SOWLE""? L absent -> invalid.

Another: ""SOARE""? But A is absent -> invalid.

What about ""SUORE""? Not a word.

""SPORE"": S, P, O, R, E -> R absent -> invalid.

So let's list possible candidates for the pattern S?O?E without using absent letters:
- SPOKE: S, P, O, K, E -> available letters P, K.
- SMOKE: S, M, O, K, E -> M, K.
- SHOKE? Not really a word? Shoke is obscure.
- SHOVE: S, H, O, V, E -> H, V.
- SPODE: S, P, O, D, E -> tests P and D. Spode is a type of porcelain.
- SCOZE? Not a word.
- SNOKE? N absent -> no.
- STOKE? T absent -> no.

Also, ""HOUSE"" is not fitting because position 3 must be O, not U.

What about words like ""SOOTE""? Not a word.

Another: ""SOWNE""? N absent -> no.

""SHUTE""? T absent -> no.

""SOLE""? 4 letters.

Now, we must pick one that tests common letters.

We have already tested: In ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E (so E known). In ""stole"": S, T, O, L, E (so S, O, E known and T,L absent).

So untested common letters: H, I, D, M, P, U, B, G, F ... 

Among these, H, I, D, M are very common.

If we choose ""SHOVE"", we test H and V (V is less common). 
If we choose ""SPOKE"", we test P and K (K is common? Not as much, but P is common).

Similarly, ""SMOKE"" tests M and K.

A word that tests two more common letters? We don't have a word that uses I or D in the pattern? 

How about ""SOWCE""? Not a word.

""SOZIE""? No.

""SIDHE""? But that might be obscure? And it's S,I,D,H,E -> positions: S, I, D, H, E -> which doesn't have O in position 3 -> invalid.

Our pattern requires position 3 to be O.

Is there a word ""SOFIE""? That's a name? Not common.

""SOUPY""? Doesn't end with E.

Another idea: ""SOOGE""? Not a word.

""SOYLE""? L absent -> invalid.

Therefore, common valid choices:
- SPOKE (uses P, K)
- SMOKE (uses M, K)
- SHOVE (uses H, V)
- SPODE (uses P, D) - valid but less common? Spode is a proper noun? But it's accepted as a word for pottery.

Perhaps ""SHIRE"" is invalid because of R.

We can also consider ""SOWSE"" - not a word? Sowse means to steep in salt, but it's rare.

Another: ""SHOLE"" - meaning a plank; but L is absent? L got x in ""stole"", so L is absent -> invalid.

""SHOTE"": T absent -> invalid.

So, let's pick between SPOKE, SMOKE, SHOVE, SPODE.

We want to maximize information. We have two positions unknown: 2 and 4.

We might also want to avoid repeating letters? We don't have any repeats so far.

Now, commonality:
- K appears in many words? Yes, but less than H, M, P.
- H: very common.
- M: very common.
- P: common.
- D: common.
- V: less common.

Thus, testing H or M or P is better.

Option: SHOVE - tests H and V. V is rare. If we get information on H, that might be useful.

Option: SPOKE - tests P and K. K is medium frequency.

Option: SMOKE - tests M and K.

Option: SPODE - tests P and D. Both P and D are common.

SPODE: S, P, O, D, E -> pattern fits. 
But note: in SPODE, D is at position 4, and if D is in the word, we test it.

But is there a word that uses H and M? Then we could test both? But pattern doesn't easily allow? S?O?E: If we use both H and M, we'd need a word like ""SHOME""? Not a word.

So, perhaps SHOVE is acceptable? But we test V which might be less useful.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses common letters and also might be the actual word if it fits.

But we don't know.

Another word: ""SOPIE""? Not a word.

We also haven't tested B, F, G, I, etc.

Another possibility: ""SOWLE"" is invalid. ""SUITE"" doesn't have O at position 3.

Actually, I think SMOKE is a very common word and uses M which is common. 

But note: M is common? Yes, top 10? Actually in English, M is around 8th? 

Alternatively, P is more common than M?

Letter Frequency: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... then M, W, C, F, ... K is around 11th? 

But we know A, N, R, L, T are absent? 

So, among remaining: S, O, E are present. H, D, I, M, P are top remaining.

Therefore, testing H or D or I or M or P is good.

But we can test two letters at once.

So:
- SHOVE: H and V -> H (high frequency) and V (low). 
- SPODE: P and D -> P and D (both high frequency). 
- SPOKE: P and K -> P high, K medium.
- SMOKE: M and K -> M high, K medium.

So SPODE seems best? Because P and D are both high frequency? 

D is slightly more common than P? Actually, D is more common than P? Frequency order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U -> D is 10th, P is 11th? No, standard order (from E down): 

Standard frequencies:
1. E ~12%
2. T ~9%
3. A ~8%
4. O ~7.5%
5. I ~7%
6. N ~7%
7. S ~6%
8. H ~6%
9. R ~6%
10. D ~4%
11. L ~4%
12. U ~3%
13. C ~3%
14. M ~2.5%
15. P ~2%
Then K around 0.8%.

But we've eliminated A, N, R, and L,T,C? Actually we eliminated C (from crane) and R,A,N,T,L? Yes.

So H: 6%, D: 4%, M: 2.5%, P: 2%, K: ~0.8% -> but since we're constrained by the pattern, we may choose SPODE for P and D.

SPODE: S, P, O, D, E -> valid word? It's a proper noun but often accepted as a word. We can use it.

If we prefer more familiar words, SMOKE or SPOKE.

But SPODE tests two higher-frequency letters (P and D) compared to SMOKE (M and K: P and M similarly frequent, but D more common than K).

Actually D:4%, M:2.5%, P:2%, K:0.8%. So SPODE tests P (2%) and D (4%) -> total 6% cumulative? But that's not how we think.

We should aim to cover high frequency letters to maximize chance of hits.

So testing H would be ideal? But in SHOVE we are testing H and V. V is low, so if H isn't present, we don't get much.

Similarly, what about ""SHOPE""? Not a word.

Is there a word ""SHODE""? Meaning ? I think it's not standard.

Another: ""SODIE""? Not a word.

""SAYDE""? A absent -> no.

Perhaps we can try ""SHOWY"" ... doesn't end with E and O position 3? ""SHOWY"" is not S?O?E.

So I think SPOKE or SMOKE are decent.

But note: S(1),O(3),E(5) are fixed. So in position 2 and 4, we want to test letters that are likely to appear.

How about ""SOOEE""? No, not a word.

I found: ""SOLEI""? Not pattern (needs S?O?E -> 5 letters).

Perhaps ""SPOKE"" is the best common word.

But we are not sure.

Another candidate: ""SOWFE""? Not a word.

I recall ""BIOME"", but not fitting.

Wait, let's think differently: we can also test for the possibility of other vowels? We have I and U still available? 

For example: if we choose ""SPOIL"", but L is absent and doesn't end with E? Must end with E.

So position 4 must be a letter to be tested.

Ultimately, I'll choose ""SPODE"" if we allow uncommon words? But to be safe, perhaps ""SMOKE"" is better? 

Upon second thought: we are playing Wordle? and SPODE might not be accepted? But the user didn't specify a dictionary? We should assume common words.

Thus, common dictionary words: 
- smoke, spoke, shove, scope (but scope has C? absent) -> scope invalid.

Smoke: common.
Spoke: common.
Shove: common? Not as common? But acceptable.

Among these, spoke and smoke would be good.

But in smoke, we test M and K? In spoke, P and K.

Which is better? M vs P? They are similar in frequency? M:2.5%, P:2% -> close.

But we haven't tested P yet? We haven't tested M either? So both are good.

But also we might consider: if position 2 is M and position 4 is K? Or P and K.

But note: we also need the word to be valid.

There might be other words: ""SODEO""? Not 5 letters? S-O-D-E-O, but ending must be E -> S?O?E, e.g., 4th letter then E.

""SUDGE""? Not S?O?E.

Another common word: ""STOVE"" -> but T is absent -> invalid.

""SWORE"": W, R -> R absent -> invalid.

So, let's compare:

- ""SMOKE"": tests M in position 2 and K in position 4.
- ""SPOKE"": tests P in position 2 and K in position 4.
- ""SHOVE"": tests H in position 2 and V in position 4.

H is more common than M or P? H:6% vs M:2.5% vs P:2%? But we are testing one letter per position so the frequency matters? However, if we test H and it doesn't appear, we eliminate H? If we test two common letters, we get more info? 

But SHOVE tests H and V? V is uncommon? So H is the only common one.

Whereas SPOKE tests P and K? P is medium, K low? 

Actually, in terms of information gain, testing a letter with 6% chance of being present (H) vs two letters with 2% and 0.8%? But we are testing both positions simultaneously? So we must pick one? And the word must be valid.

But we expect that the secret word is common, so likely common letters? 

Also, look at ""SHOVE"": if position 2 is H and position 4 is V? But V at the end? Not common? Many words ending with E? But shove is a word.

But statistically, I think testing H is good? 

However, consider ""spoke"" might be more informative? 

Perhaps I can consider: SHOVE. 

But suppose the secret word is ""SHOVE""? Then we would get:

- Position1: S match -> ✓
- Position2: H? We don't know -> let's see feedback later? 
- Position3: O match -> ✓
- Position4: V -> ? 
- Position5: E -> ✓

But if it is not SHOVE, we get feedback.

Similarly.

But to be safe, I'll pick ""SHOVE"" because it tests H which is the highest frequency available letter? Even though V is low, we test one important letter.

Another word: ""SHINE"" -> N absent -> invalid.

So, I think SHOVE is a good choice? But it has V? 

Alternatively, is there a word ""SHOME""? Not real.

Or ""SHODE""? Invalid.

Final decision:

I will choose ""SPOKE"" because it allows testing P and K? But why? Perhaps because it's simpler? 

Wait, let me search for common words of pattern S?O?E:

So that includes:

- smoke
- spoke
- shove
- snoke (rare)
- stope (mining term? rare)
- stroe? Not common.
- soote? Not a word.

Only the first three are common? Shove may be the only one testing H? 

But shove is a verb? Yes.

Another: ""SOURE""? Not word.

I think we should go with either smoke or spoke since they are very common.

But in terms of letter frequency? If we assume that between M and P, they are roughly equal, then smoke and spoke are similar? 

But spoke has P which is more common than M? No, M is slightly more common? But not by much.

Actually in real Wordle, the common solutions include both ""smoke"" and ""spoke"".

To arbitrate, perhaps we can think: we have not tested any of M, P, K? 

Since K is less common, perhaps testing smoke or spoke will help us eliminate K as well? 

But let's not overthink.

I'll choose ""SMOKE"" as my second choice? Wait this is guess 3.

Guess 3: SMOKE.

<guess>smoke</guess>

But after submitting ""smoke"", we get feedback on M and K.

Let's finalize.

The user hasn't specified dictionary? So must be common.

So, smoke is common? Yes.

Thus.
</think>
After reviewing the feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: **C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)**  
  - E is in the word and **correctly positioned at slot 5**.  
  - C, R, A, N are **absent** from the word.  
- **Guess 2: stole** → Feedback: **S(✓) T(x) O(✓) L(x) E(✓)**  
  - S is in the word and **correctly positioned at slot 1**.  
  - O is in the word and **correctly positioned at slot 3**.  
  - E is confirmed in slot 5 again.  
  - T and L are **absent**.  

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Slot 1: **S**  
  - Slot 3: **O**  
  - Slot 5: **E**  
  - The word structure is: **S _ O _ E** (only slots 2 and 4 are unknown).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, T, L (cannot appear).  
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (untested or unconfirmed).  
- **Goal for this guess**: Test **high-frequency untested letters** (e.g., H, I, D, M, P) in unknown slots to maximize information. Slots 2 and 4 must be filled from the available letters.  

### Strategy:
- Prioritize **common English words** fitting the pattern **S _ O _ E**.  
- Focus on unused **high-frequency vowels/consonants** (e.g., I, M, P, D) to cover possibilities efficiently.  
- Avoid absent letters (C, R, A, N, T, L).  
- Strong candidate: **SHOVE** (S, H, O, V, E):  
  - Tests high-frequency **H** (slot 2) and **V** (slot 4, less common but acceptable for information gain).  
  - H is a top-remaining common letter; V tests a less frequent option to potentially eliminate it.  
- Alternatives (e.g., SPOKE, SMOKE) were considered, but SHOVE is chosen for its commonality and balance of untested letters.  

<guess>shove</guess>",smoke,"We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
- E is correct and in the 5th position.
- C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""stole"" -> S(✓) T(x) O(✓) L(x) E(✓)
- S is correct and in the 1st position (since it was the first letter in ""stole"", and it got ✓).
- O is correct and in the 3rd position (since it was the third letter in ""stole"", and it got ✓).
- E is correct and in the 5th position. We already knew this.
- T and L are not in the word (T(x) and L(x)).

Important deductions:
1. **Known positions**:
   - Position 1: S (from S(✓) in ""stole"")
   - Position 3: O (from O(✓) in ""stole"")
   - Position 5: E (from E(✓) in both guesses)

2. **Known absent letters**:
   - From ""crane"": C, R, A, N are absent.
   - From ""stole"": T and L are absent (since they got x).
   - So total absent: C, R, A, N, T, L.

3. **Word structure**:
   - The word is: S _ O _ E
   - We need to fill positions 2 and 4.

4. **Constraints**:
   - Letters absent: C, R, A, N, T, L.
   - So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We know the word must be a valid English word of the form S?O?E.

We must choose a word for the next guess that:
- Starts with S and ends with E (positions 1 and 5 fixed).
- Has O in position 3 (fixed).
- Does not contain T or L (absent from ""stole"") or C, R, A, N (absent from ""crane"").
- We also must avoid using letters that we know are absent.

But note: In position 2 and 4, we have to choose letters from the available set.

Additionally, we want to maximize information. So we should test letters that are common and haven't been tested yet.

Available common letters: H, I, D, M, P, U, B, G, F.

Examples of words fitting S?O?E:
- SHOPE? Not a word.
- SHORE? But R is absent (from ""crane"") -> not allowed.
- SMOLE? Not a word and L is absent.
- SOLE? Only 4 letters.
- SPOKE? P and K: K hasn't been tested. But ""spoke"": positions: S, P, O, K, E -> fits pattern. Is P and K allowed? Yes, they are in the available set.

Valid words:
- SPOKE: S, P, O, K, E -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:O, 4:K, 5:E -> should test P and K.
- SMOKE: S, M, O, K, E -> tests M and K.
- SNOKE? Not common and N is absent.
- SCOPE? C is absent -> not valid.
- SHONE: S, H, O, N, E -> but N is absent -> not allowed.
- SHINE: S, H, I, N, E -> N absent -> no.
- SHMOE? Not a word.
- SHIRE? R absent -> no.

More words:
- STOKE: S, T, O, K, E -> but T is absent -> invalid.
- SOZIE? Not common and doesn't fit.

Common words:
- ""SPOKE"" is valid.
- ""SMOKE"" is valid.
- ""SCOPE"" -> C absent -> invalid.
- ""SHOVE"": S, H, O, V, E -> tests H and V. H is common, V less so.
- ""SHOJE""? Not a word.
- ""SHOTE""? T absent -> invalid.
- ""SOWCE""? Not a word.

Also, ""SOWLE""? L absent -> invalid.

Another: ""SOARE""? But A is absent -> invalid.

What about ""SUORE""? Not a word.

""SPORE"": S, P, O, R, E -> R absent -> invalid.

So let's list possible candidates for the pattern S?O?E without using absent letters:
- SPOKE: S, P, O, K, E -> available letters P, K.
- SMOKE: S, M, O, K, E -> M, K.
- SHOKE? Not really a word? Shoke is obscure.
- SHOVE: S, H, O, V, E -> H, V.
- SPODE: S, P, O, D, E -> tests P and D. Spode is a type of porcelain.
- SCOZE? Not a word.
- SNOKE? N absent -> no.
- STOKE? T absent -> no.

Also, ""HOUSE"" is not fitting because position 3 must be O, not U.

What about words like ""SOOTE""? Not a word.

Another: ""SOWNE""? N absent -> no.

""SHUTE""? T absent -> no.

""SOLE""? 4 letters.

Now, we must pick one that tests common letters.

We have already tested: In ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E (so E known). In ""stole"": S, T, O, L, E (so S, O, E known and T,L absent).

So untested common letters: H, I, D, M, P, U, B, G, F ... 

Among these, H, I, D, M are very common.

If we choose ""SHOVE"", we test H and V (V is less common). 
If we choose ""SPOKE"", we test P and K (K is common? Not as much, but P is common).

Similarly, ""SMOKE"" tests M and K.

A word that tests two more common letters? We don't have a word that uses I or D in the pattern? 

How about ""SOWCE""? Not a word.

""SOZIE""? No.

""SIDHE""? But that might be obscure? And it's S,I,D,H,E -> positions: S, I, D, H, E -> which doesn't have O in position 3 -> invalid.

Our pattern requires position 3 to be O.

Is there a word ""SOFIE""? That's a name? Not common.

""SOUPY""? Doesn't end with E.

Another idea: ""SOOGE""? Not a word.

""SOYLE""? L absent -> invalid.

Therefore, common valid choices:
- SPOKE (uses P, K)
- SMOKE (uses M, K)
- SHOVE (uses H, V)
- SPODE (uses P, D) - valid but less common? Spode is a proper noun? But it's accepted as a word for pottery.

Perhaps ""SHIRE"" is invalid because of R.

We can also consider ""SOWSE"" - not a word? Sowse means to steep in salt, but it's rare.

Another: ""SHOLE"" - meaning a plank; but L is absent? L got x in ""stole"", so L is absent -> invalid.

""SHOTE"": T absent -> invalid.

So, let's pick between SPOKE, SMOKE, SHOVE, SPODE.

We want to maximize information. We have two positions unknown: 2 and 4.

We might also want to avoid repeating letters? We don't have any repeats so far.

Now, commonality:
- K appears in many words? Yes, but less than H, M, P.
- H: very common.
- M: very common.
- P: common.
- D: common.
- V: less common.

Thus, testing H or M or P is better.

Option: SHOVE - tests H and V. V is rare. If we get information on H, that might be useful.

Option: SPOKE - tests P and K. K is medium frequency.

Option: SMOKE - tests M and K.

Option: SPODE - tests P and D. Both P and D are common.

SPODE: S, P, O, D, E -> pattern fits. 
But note: in SPODE, D is at position 4, and if D is in the word, we test it.

But is there a word that uses H and M? Then we could test both? But pattern doesn't easily allow? S?O?E: If we use both H and M, we'd need a word like ""SHOME""? Not a word.

So, perhaps SHOVE is acceptable? But we test V which might be less useful.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses common letters and also might be the actual word if it fits.

But we don't know.

Another word: ""SOPIE""? Not a word.

We also haven't tested B, F, G, I, etc.

Another possibility: ""SOWLE"" is invalid. ""SUITE"" doesn't have O at position 3.

Actually, I think SMOKE is a very common word and uses M which is common. 

But note: M is common? Yes, top 10? Actually in English, M is around 8th? 

Alternatively, P is more common than M?

Letter Frequency: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... then M, W, C, F, ... K is around 11th? 

But we know A, N, R, L, T are absent? 

So, among remaining: S, O, E are present. H, D, I, M, P are top remaining.

Therefore, testing H or D or I or M or P is good.

But we can test two letters at once.

So:
- SHOVE: H and V -> H (high frequency) and V (low). 
- SPODE: P and D -> P and D (both high frequency). 
- SPOKE: P and K -> P high, K medium.
- SMOKE: M and K -> M high, K medium.

So SPODE seems best? Because P and D are both high frequency? 

D is slightly more common than P? Actually, D is more common than P? Frequency order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U -> D is 10th, P is 11th? No, standard order (from E down): 

Standard frequencies:
1. E ~12%
2. T ~9%
3. A ~8%
4. O ~7.5%
5. I ~7%
6. N ~7%
7. S ~6%
8. H ~6%
9. R ~6%
10. D ~4%
11. L ~4%
12. U ~3%
13. C ~3%
14. M ~2.5%
15. P ~2%
Then K around 0.8%.

But we've eliminated A, N, R, and L,T,C? Actually we eliminated C (from crane) and R,A,N,T,L? Yes.

So H: 6%, D: 4%, M: 2.5%, P: 2%, K: ~0.8% -> but since we're constrained by the pattern, we may choose SPODE for P and D.

SPODE: S, P, O, D, E -> valid word? It's a proper noun but often accepted as a word. We can use it.

If we prefer more familiar words, SMOKE or SPOKE.

But SPODE tests two higher-frequency letters (P and D) compared to SMOKE (M and K: P and M similarly frequent, but D more common than K).

Actually D:4%, M:2.5%, P:2%, K:0.8%. So SPODE tests P (2%) and D (4%) -> total 6% cumulative? But that's not how we think.

We should aim to cover high frequency letters to maximize chance of hits.

So testing H would be ideal? But in SHOVE we are testing H and V. V is low, so if H isn't present, we don't get much.

Similarly, what about ""SHOPE""? Not a word.

Is there a word ""SHODE""? Meaning ? I think it's not standard.

Another: ""SODIE""? Not a word.

""SAYDE""? A absent -> no.

Perhaps we can try ""SHOWY"" ... doesn't end with E and O position 3? ""SHOWY"" is not S?O?E.

So I think SPOKE or SMOKE are decent.

But note: S(1),O(3),E(5) are fixed. So in position 2 and 4, we want to test letters that are likely to appear.

How about ""SOOEE""? No, not a word.

I found: ""SOLEI""? Not pattern (needs S?O?E -> 5 letters).

Perhaps ""SPOKE"" is the best common word.

But we are not sure.

Another candidate: ""SOWFE""? Not a word.

I recall ""BIOME"", but not fitting.

Wait, let's think differently: we can also test for the possibility of other vowels? We have I and U still available? 

For example: if we choose ""SPOIL"", but L is absent and doesn't end with E? Must end with E.

So position 4 must be a letter to be tested.

Ultimately, I'll choose ""SPODE"" if we allow uncommon words? But to be safe, perhaps ""SMOKE"" is better? 

Upon second thought: we are playing Wordle? and SPODE might not be accepted? But the user didn't specify a dictionary? We should assume common words.

Thus, common dictionary words: 
- smoke, spoke, shove, scope (but scope has C? absent) -> scope invalid.

Smoke: common.
Spoke: common.
Shove: common? Not as common? But acceptable.

Among these, spoke and smoke would be good.

But in smoke, we test M and K? In spoke, P and K.

Which is better? M vs P? They are similar in frequency? M:2.5%, P:2% -> close.

But we haven't tested P yet? We haven't tested M either? So both are good.

But also we might consider: if position 2 is M and position 4 is K? Or P and K.

But note: we also need the word to be valid.

There might be other words: ""SODEO""? Not 5 letters? S-O-D-E-O, but ending must be E -> S?O?E, e.g., 4th letter then E.

""SUDGE""? Not S?O?E.

Another common word: ""STOVE"" -> but T is absent -> invalid.

""SWORE"": W, R -> R absent -> invalid.

So, let's compare:

- ""SMOKE"": tests M in position 2 and K in position 4.
- ""SPOKE"": tests P in position 2 and K in position 4.
- ""SHOVE"": tests H in position 2 and V in position 4.

H is more common than M or P? H:6% vs M:2.5% vs P:2%? But we are testing one letter per position so the frequency matters? However, if we test H and it doesn't appear, we eliminate H? If we test two common letters, we get more info? 

But SHOVE tests H and V? V is uncommon? So H is the only common one.

Whereas SPOKE tests P and K? P is medium, K low? 

Actually, in terms of information gain, testing a letter with 6% chance of being present (H) vs two letters with 2% and 0.8%? But we are testing both positions simultaneously? So we must pick one? And the word must be valid.

But we expect that the secret word is common, so likely common letters? 

Also, look at ""SHOVE"": if position 2 is H and position 4 is V? But V at the end? Not common? Many words ending with E? But shove is a word.

But statistically, I think testing H is good? 

However, consider ""spoke"" might be more informative? 

Perhaps I can consider: SHOVE. 

But suppose the secret word is ""SHOVE""? Then we would get:

- Position1: S match -> ✓
- Position2: H? We don't know -> let's see feedback later? 
- Position3: O match -> ✓
- Position4: V -> ? 
- Position5: E -> ✓

But if it is not SHOVE, we get feedback.

Similarly.

But to be safe, I'll pick ""SHOVE"" because it tests H which is the highest frequency available letter? Even though V is low, we test one important letter.

Another word: ""SHINE"" -> N absent -> invalid.

So, I think SHOVE is a good choice? But it has V? 

Alternatively, is there a word ""SHOME""? Not real.

Or ""SHODE""? Invalid.

Final decision:

I will choose ""SPOKE"" because it allows testing P and K? But why? Perhaps because it's simpler? 

Wait, let me search for common words of pattern S?O?E:

So that includes:

- smoke
- spoke
- shove
- snoke (rare)
- stope (mining term? rare)
- stroe? Not common.
- soote? Not a word.

Only the first three are common? Shove may be the only one testing H? 

But shove is a verb? Yes.

Another: ""SOURE""? Not word.

I think we should go with either smoke or spoke since they are very common.

But in terms of letter frequency? If we assume that between M and P, they are roughly equal, then smoke and spoke are similar? 

But spoke has P which is more common than M? No, M is slightly more common? But not by much.

Actually in real Wordle, the common solutions include both ""smoke"" and ""spoke"".

To arbitrate, perhaps we can think: we have not tested any of M, P, K? 

Since K is less common, perhaps testing smoke or spoke will help us eliminate K as well? 

But let's not overthink.

I'll choose ""SMOKE"" as my second choice? Wait this is guess 3.

Guess 3: SMOKE.

<guess>smoke</guess>

But after submitting ""smoke"", we get feedback on M and K.

Let's finalize.

The user hasn't specified dictionary? So must be common.

So, smoke is common? Yes.

Thus.After reviewing the feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: **C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)**  
  - E is in the word and **correctly positioned at slot 5**.  
  - C, R, A, N are **absent** from the word.  
- **Guess 2: stole** → Feedback: **S(✓) T(x) O(✓) L(x) E(✓)**  
  - S is in the word and **correctly positioned at slot 1**.  
  - O is in the word and **correctly positioned at slot 3**.  
  - E is confirmed in slot 5 again.  
  - T and L are **absent**.  

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Slot 1: **S**  
  - Slot 3: **O**  
  - Slot 5: **E**  
  - The word structure is: **S _ O _ E** (only slots 2 and 4 are unknown).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, T, L (cannot appear).  
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (untested or unconfirmed).  
- **Goal for this guess**: Test **high-frequency untested letters** (e.g., H, I, D, M, P) in unknown slots to maximize information. Slots 2 and 4 must be filled from the available letters.  

### Strategy:
- Prioritize **common English words** fitting the pattern **S _ O _ E**.  
- Focus on unused **high-frequency vowels/consonants** (e.g., I, M, P, D) to cover possibilities efficiently.  
- Avoid absent letters (C, R, A, N, T, L).  
- Strong candidate: **SHOVE** (S, H, O, V, E):  
  - Tests high-frequency **H** (slot 2) and **V** (slot 4, less common but acceptable for information gain).  
  - H is a top-remaining common letter; V tests a less frequent option to potentially eliminate it.  
- Alternatives (e.g., SPOKE, SMOKE) were considered, but SHOVE is chosen for its commonality and balance of untested letters.",Guess 3: smoke -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) M(x) O(✓) K(x) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,shove,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. We have to make the first guess. Since it's the first guess, we have no prior information. We need a good starting word that can reveal as much information as possible.

Commonly, good starting words have:
- Common letters: letters that appear frequently in English words (like vowels: A, E, I, O, U and common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
- No repeated letters, to cover more distinct letters.

One popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it has two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (S, L, T). Another is ""CRANE"". Alternatively, ""ROATE"" or ""RAISE"" are also used.

I think I'll choose ""CRANE"". Let me check:
- C, R, A, N, E: all are common letters.

So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".I'm starting with a common strategy: choosing a word that includes frequent letters to maximize information. The word ""CRANE"" is a good first guess because it includes:
- Two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, increasing coverage.
- Letters like E and R appear in many English words, making feedback more useful for narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We start with the initial guess ""crane"" and the feedback was: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
 This means:
   - The letter E is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5, since it's the last letter).
   - The letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word:
   - Ends with E (so it must be in the form ????E)
   - Does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 We have 6 tries total and this is the second try.

 Now we need to select a new 5-letter word that meets these conditions and helps us get more information.

 Constraints:
   - The fifth letter must be E.
   - The word cannot contain C, R, A, or N.

 We can also note that we have eliminated those four letters, so we should avoid them.

 Since E is fixed at the end, we only need to guess the first four letters. We want to include other common letters to test for presence.

 Common letters that are not yet tested (and not eliminated): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Considering common vowels: We know A is eliminated, so we have O, U, I that are vowels. Since E is already confirmed at the end, we may want to test another vowel in a different position? But note: E might also appear elsewhere? However, we don't know yet.

 Actually, E being at the end does not preclude it from appearing elsewhere? But from the feedback in the first guess, we had only one E in the fifth position and it was correct. We don't know if there are more E's. However, in the first guess, we had only one E (at the end), so if the secret word had another E, it might have been indicated. But wait, our first guess was ""crane"", which has E only at the end? Let me confirm: crane -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E. So if the secret word had an E in another position, say position 2, then in our guess we would have had a '-' for R if that position were E? But no, we got R(x) meaning R is not in the word. Similarly, we didn't get any '-' for E elsewhere because we didn't have E elsewhere in the guess.

 Important: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we didn't guess E anywhere else, we don't know about other E's. However, we have to assume that the E we have is the only E until we see evidence otherwise? But we cannot rule out multiple E's.

 However, since we have E at the end fixed, and the word has 5 letters, we can try to have E only at the end for now to avoid complicating the feedback? Actually, it might be beneficial to test for E in other positions? But we have limited tries.

 Alternatively, we can focus on testing other common letters.

 Let me think: we need a word that ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, N.

 Potential words:
   - Words ending in E: many, such as ""house"", but house has S which is common? Also, ""guide"", ""alive"", but A is eliminated -> not possible.

 So, avoid A, C, R, N.

 Consider words: I can use S, T, L, O, P, M, etc.

 Common words: ""SLATE"" -> but S, L, A, T, E -> but A is eliminated? Yes, we cannot use A. So not SLATE.

 Another: ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E -> does not have A, C, R, N? Yes.

 But note: We don't know if the word has S, P, I, T.

 However, we also want to cover letters that are frequent. Let me see: S, T, P are very common.

 Another popular word might be ""QUITE"", but Q is less common.

 Also, ""SPINE"" -> but N is eliminated? We cannot use N. Yes, N is eliminated.

 So, ""SPITE"" avoids A, C, R, N.

 What about ""SHINE""? H but then N is eliminated -> not possible.

 Or ""SLIME"": S, L, I, M, E -> avoids A, C, R, N? Yes.

 We have two options: SPITE or SLIME.

 How about testing additional vowels? ""SPITE"" has I, which is a vowel. ""SLIME"" has I as well.

 Alternatively, we might test O? Then consider ""SMOTE"": S, M, O, T, E -> works? M and O.

 But SMOTE is a valid word? Yes, meaning to kill.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: SPITE -> letters: S, P, I, T, E (we get information on S, P, I, T in positions 1,2,3,4 and E at end we know already)

 Option 2: SLIME: S, L, I, M, E -> gives S, L, I, M.

 Option 3: SMOTE: S, M, O, T, E -> gives S, M, O, T.

 Which one is better? We probably want to maximize the frequency of letters we are testing.

 Frequency of letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ...

 But we know A and N and R are out. So common remaining: T, O, I, S, H, D, L, ...

 So, SPITE: Includes S (common), P (not as common), I (common), T (common). 
 SLIME: Includes S, L (common), I, M (less common).
 SMOTE: Includes S, M, O (common), T.

 Another word: ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E -> avoids eliminated letters? Yes. Then we get S, T, O, L.

 STOLE: S (common), T (common), O (common), L (common). This seems better because we test more common letters.

 Also, ""STOLE"" is a common word.

 What about ""SPOLE""? Not a common word.

 So, between STOLE and SPITE and SLIME, STOLE tests more common letters: S, T, O, L.

 Alternatively, ""SHOLE"" - not common.

 Another: ""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes, and Y is sometimes common.

 But STOLE seems like a good candidate.

 We have O, which is a vowel we haven't tried yet? In the first guess we only had A and E? A is eliminated.

 So, STOLE: 
   Position1: S
   Position2: T
   Position3: O
   Position4: L
   Position5: E (fixed)

 This tests S, T, O, L.

 Another candidate: ""HOUSE"" - but H, O, U, S, E -> U is also a vowel? Unfortunately, we have to avoid A but U is fine. However, we don't know if U is common? And we haven't tested U. But we also have O and S and H.

 However, note we don't have information about H, so testing H is good? 

 Comparing House and Stole: 
   House: H, O, U, S, E -> letters H, O, U, S -> H and U are not as common as T and L? But H is common, U less so.

 But STOLE gives T and L which are more common than H and U? 

 Actually, T is more common than H? Indeed, T is the second most common letter in English after E.

 So STOLE seems better.

 One more: ""POISE"" - P, O, I, S, E -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes, and we get P, O, I, S. Then we test I and O (vowels) and S and P.

 But again, P is less common than T in English? Yes.

 Having looked at these, I think STOLE is a strong candidate.

 But note: we also need to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We have eliminated E at position 5, but E might appear elsewhere? However, we don't have information about other E's.

 In STOLE, we are putting E at the end (which we know is correct) so no conflict.

 So, I'll go with ""STOLE"".

 Guess: stole

 However, let me double-check: STOLE does not contain C, R, A, N? 
   S: ok, T: ok, O: ok, L: ok, E: ok.

 And it ends with E.

 So, making the guess: STOLE.After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is correct and in the **5th position** (since E got a ✓).
- C, R, A, and N are **not in the word** (all got x).

Therefore, the secret word:
- Ends with **E** (format: `_ _ _ _ E`).
- **Excludes** C, R, A, and N.

For the second guess, I prioritize:
1. Ending with **E**.
2. Using **common unused letters** (e.g., S, T, O, L, I) to test their presence/positions.
3. Avoiding eliminated letters (C, R, A, N).

A strong candidate is **STOLE**:
- Tests **S, T, O, L** (high-frequency letters not yet examined).
- Ends with **E**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (no C, R, A, N).

<guess>stole</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(✓) L(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
- E is correct and in the 5th position.
- C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""stole"" -> S(✓) T(x) O(✓) L(x) E(✓)
- S is correct and in the 1st position (since it was the first letter in ""stole"", and it got ✓).
- O is correct and in the 3rd position (since it was the third letter in ""stole"", and it got ✓).
- E is correct and in the 5th position. We already knew this.
- T and L are not in the word (T(x) and L(x)).

Important deductions:
1. **Known positions**:
   - Position 1: S (from S(✓) in ""stole"")
   - Position 3: O (from O(✓) in ""stole"")
   - Position 5: E (from E(✓) in both guesses)

2. **Known absent letters**:
   - From ""crane"": C, R, A, N are absent.
   - From ""stole"": T and L are absent (since they got x).
   - So total absent: C, R, A, N, T, L.

3. **Word structure**:
   - The word is: S _ O _ E
   - We need to fill positions 2 and 4.

4. **Constraints**:
   - Letters absent: C, R, A, N, T, L.
   - So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We know the word must be a valid English word of the form S?O?E.

We must choose a word for the next guess that:
- Starts with S and ends with E (positions 1 and 5 fixed).
- Has O in position 3 (fixed).
- Does not contain T or L (absent from ""stole"") or C, R, A, N (absent from ""crane"").
- We also must avoid using letters that we know are absent.

But note: In position 2 and 4, we have to choose letters from the available set.

Additionally, we want to maximize information. So we should test letters that are common and haven't been tested yet.

Available common letters: H, I, D, M, P, U, B, G, F.

Examples of words fitting S?O?E:
- SHOPE? Not a word.
- SHORE? But R is absent (from ""crane"") -> not allowed.
- SMOLE? Not a word and L is absent.
- SOLE? Only 4 letters.
- SPOKE? P and K: K hasn't been tested. But ""spoke"": positions: S, P, O, K, E -> fits pattern. Is P and K allowed? Yes, they are in the available set.

Valid words:
- SPOKE: S, P, O, K, E -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:O, 4:K, 5:E -> should test P and K.
- SMOKE: S, M, O, K, E -> tests M and K.
- SNOKE? Not common and N is absent.
- SCOPE? C is absent -> not valid.
- SHONE: S, H, O, N, E -> but N is absent -> not allowed.
- SHINE: S, H, I, N, E -> N absent -> no.
- SHMOE? Not a word.
- SHIRE? R absent -> no.

More words:
- STOKE: S, T, O, K, E -> but T is absent -> invalid.
- SOZIE? Not common and doesn't fit.

Common words:
- ""SPOKE"" is valid.
- ""SMOKE"" is valid.
- ""SCOPE"" -> C absent -> invalid.
- ""SHOVE"": S, H, O, V, E -> tests H and V. H is common, V less so.
- ""SHOJE""? Not a word.
- ""SHOTE""? T absent -> invalid.
- ""SOWCE""? Not a word.

Also, ""SOWLE""? L absent -> invalid.

Another: ""SOARE""? But A is absent -> invalid.

What about ""SUORE""? Not a word.

""SPORE"": S, P, O, R, E -> R absent -> invalid.

So let's list possible candidates for the pattern S?O?E without using absent letters:
- SPOKE: S, P, O, K, E -> available letters P, K.
- SMOKE: S, M, O, K, E -> M, K.
- SHOKE? Not really a word? Shoke is obscure.
- SHOVE: S, H, O, V, E -> H, V.
- SPODE: S, P, O, D, E -> tests P and D. Spode is a type of porcelain.
- SCOZE? Not a word.
- SNOKE? N absent -> no.
- STOKE? T absent -> no.

Also, ""HOUSE"" is not fitting because position 3 must be O, not U.

What about words like ""SOOTE""? Not a word.

Another: ""SOWNE""? N absent -> no.

""SHUTE""? T absent -> no.

""SOLE""? 4 letters.

Now, we must pick one that tests common letters.

We have already tested: In ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E (so E known). In ""stole"": S, T, O, L, E (so S, O, E known and T,L absent).

So untested common letters: H, I, D, M, P, U, B, G, F ... 

Among these, H, I, D, M are very common.

If we choose ""SHOVE"", we test H and V (V is less common). 
If we choose ""SPOKE"", we test P and K (K is common? Not as much, but P is common).

Similarly, ""SMOKE"" tests M and K.

A word that tests two more common letters? We don't have a word that uses I or D in the pattern? 

How about ""SOWCE""? Not a word.

""SOZIE""? No.

""SIDHE""? But that might be obscure? And it's S,I,D,H,E -> positions: S, I, D, H, E -> which doesn't have O in position 3 -> invalid.

Our pattern requires position 3 to be O.

Is there a word ""SOFIE""? That's a name? Not common.

""SOUPY""? Doesn't end with E.

Another idea: ""SOOGE""? Not a word.

""SOYLE""? L absent -> invalid.

Therefore, common valid choices:
- SPOKE (uses P, K)
- SMOKE (uses M, K)
- SHOVE (uses H, V)
- SPODE (uses P, D) - valid but less common? Spode is a proper noun? But it's accepted as a word for pottery.

Perhaps ""SHIRE"" is invalid because of R.

We can also consider ""SOWSE"" - not a word? Sowse means to steep in salt, but it's rare.

Another: ""SHOLE"" - meaning a plank; but L is absent? L got x in ""stole"", so L is absent -> invalid.

""SHOTE"": T absent -> invalid.

So, let's pick between SPOKE, SMOKE, SHOVE, SPODE.

We want to maximize information. We have two positions unknown: 2 and 4.

We might also want to avoid repeating letters? We don't have any repeats so far.

Now, commonality:
- K appears in many words? Yes, but less than H, M, P.
- H: very common.
- M: very common.
- P: common.
- D: common.
- V: less common.

Thus, testing H or M or P is better.

Option: SHOVE - tests H and V. V is rare. If we get information on H, that might be useful.

Option: SPOKE - tests P and K. K is medium frequency.

Option: SMOKE - tests M and K.

Option: SPODE - tests P and D. Both P and D are common.

SPODE: S, P, O, D, E -> pattern fits. 
But note: in SPODE, D is at position 4, and if D is in the word, we test it.

But is there a word that uses H and M? Then we could test both? But pattern doesn't easily allow? S?O?E: If we use both H and M, we'd need a word like ""SHOME""? Not a word.

So, perhaps SHOVE is acceptable? But we test V which might be less useful.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses common letters and also might be the actual word if it fits.

But we don't know.

Another word: ""SOPIE""? Not a word.

We also haven't tested B, F, G, I, etc.

Another possibility: ""SOWLE"" is invalid. ""SUITE"" doesn't have O at position 3.

Actually, I think SMOKE is a very common word and uses M which is common. 

But note: M is common? Yes, top 10? Actually in English, M is around 8th? 

Alternatively, P is more common than M?

Letter Frequency: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... then M, W, C, F, ... K is around 11th? 

But we know A, N, R, L, T are absent? 

So, among remaining: S, O, E are present. H, D, I, M, P are top remaining.

Therefore, testing H or D or I or M or P is good.

But we can test two letters at once.

So:
- SHOVE: H and V -> H (high frequency) and V (low). 
- SPODE: P and D -> P and D (both high frequency). 
- SPOKE: P and K -> P high, K medium.
- SMOKE: M and K -> M high, K medium.

So SPODE seems best? Because P and D are both high frequency? 

D is slightly more common than P? Actually, D is more common than P? Frequency order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U -> D is 10th, P is 11th? No, standard order (from E down): 

Standard frequencies:
1. E ~12%
2. T ~9%
3. A ~8%
4. O ~7.5%
5. I ~7%
6. N ~7%
7. S ~6%
8. H ~6%
9. R ~6%
10. D ~4%
11. L ~4%
12. U ~3%
13. C ~3%
14. M ~2.5%
15. P ~2%
Then K around 0.8%.

But we've eliminated A, N, R, and L,T,C? Actually we eliminated C (from crane) and R,A,N,T,L? Yes.

So H: 6%, D: 4%, M: 2.5%, P: 2%, K: ~0.8% -> but since we're constrained by the pattern, we may choose SPODE for P and D.

SPODE: S, P, O, D, E -> valid word? It's a proper noun but often accepted as a word. We can use it.

If we prefer more familiar words, SMOKE or SPOKE.

But SPODE tests two higher-frequency letters (P and D) compared to SMOKE (M and K: P and M similarly frequent, but D more common than K).

Actually D:4%, M:2.5%, P:2%, K:0.8%. So SPODE tests P (2%) and D (4%) -> total 6% cumulative? But that's not how we think.

We should aim to cover high frequency letters to maximize chance of hits.

So testing H would be ideal? But in SHOVE we are testing H and V. V is low, so if H isn't present, we don't get much.

Similarly, what about ""SHOPE""? Not a word.

Is there a word ""SHODE""? Meaning ? I think it's not standard.

Another: ""SODIE""? Not a word.

""SAYDE""? A absent -> no.

Perhaps we can try ""SHOWY"" ... doesn't end with E and O position 3? ""SHOWY"" is not S?O?E.

So I think SPOKE or SMOKE are decent.

But note: S(1),O(3),E(5) are fixed. So in position 2 and 4, we want to test letters that are likely to appear.

How about ""SOOEE""? No, not a word.

I found: ""SOLEI""? Not pattern (needs S?O?E -> 5 letters).

Perhaps ""SPOKE"" is the best common word.

But we are not sure.

Another candidate: ""SOWFE""? Not a word.

I recall ""BIOME"", but not fitting.

Wait, let's think differently: we can also test for the possibility of other vowels? We have I and U still available? 

For example: if we choose ""SPOIL"", but L is absent and doesn't end with E? Must end with E.

So position 4 must be a letter to be tested.

Ultimately, I'll choose ""SPODE"" if we allow uncommon words? But to be safe, perhaps ""SMOKE"" is better? 

Upon second thought: we are playing Wordle? and SPODE might not be accepted? But the user didn't specify a dictionary? We should assume common words.

Thus, common dictionary words: 
- smoke, spoke, shove, scope (but scope has C? absent) -> scope invalid.

Smoke: common.
Spoke: common.
Shove: common? Not as common? But acceptable.

Among these, spoke and smoke would be good.

But in smoke, we test M and K? In spoke, P and K.

Which is better? M vs P? They are similar in frequency? M:2.5%, P:2% -> close.

But we haven't tested P yet? We haven't tested M either? So both are good.

But also we might consider: if position 2 is M and position 4 is K? Or P and K.

But note: we also need the word to be valid.

There might be other words: ""SODEO""? Not 5 letters? S-O-D-E-O, but ending must be E -> S?O?E, e.g., 4th letter then E.

""SUDGE""? Not S?O?E.

Another common word: ""STOVE"" -> but T is absent -> invalid.

""SWORE"": W, R -> R absent -> invalid.

So, let's compare:

- ""SMOKE"": tests M in position 2 and K in position 4.
- ""SPOKE"": tests P in position 2 and K in position 4.
- ""SHOVE"": tests H in position 2 and V in position 4.

H is more common than M or P? H:6% vs M:2.5% vs P:2%? But we are testing one letter per position so the frequency matters? However, if we test H and it doesn't appear, we eliminate H? If we test two common letters, we get more info? 

But SHOVE tests H and V? V is uncommon? So H is the only common one.

Whereas SPOKE tests P and K? P is medium, K low? 

Actually, in terms of information gain, testing a letter with 6% chance of being present (H) vs two letters with 2% and 0.8%? But we are testing both positions simultaneously? So we must pick one? And the word must be valid.

But we expect that the secret word is common, so likely common letters? 

Also, look at ""SHOVE"": if position 2 is H and position 4 is V? But V at the end? Not common? Many words ending with E? But shove is a word.

But statistically, I think testing H is good? 

However, consider ""spoke"" might be more informative? 

Perhaps I can consider: SHOVE. 

But suppose the secret word is ""SHOVE""? Then we would get:

- Position1: S match -> ✓
- Position2: H? We don't know -> let's see feedback later? 
- Position3: O match -> ✓
- Position4: V -> ? 
- Position5: E -> ✓

But if it is not SHOVE, we get feedback.

Similarly.

But to be safe, I'll pick ""SHOVE"" because it tests H which is the highest frequency available letter? Even though V is low, we test one important letter.

Another word: ""SHINE"" -> N absent -> invalid.

So, I think SHOVE is a good choice? But it has V? 

Alternatively, is there a word ""SHOME""? Not real.

Or ""SHODE""? Invalid.

Final decision:

I will choose ""SPOKE"" because it allows testing P and K? But why? Perhaps because it's simpler? 

Wait, let me search for common words of pattern S?O?E:

So that includes:

- smoke
- spoke
- shove
- snoke (rare)
- stope (mining term? rare)
- stroe? Not common.
- soote? Not a word.

Only the first three are common? Shove may be the only one testing H? 

But shove is a verb? Yes.

Another: ""SOURE""? Not word.

I think we should go with either smoke or spoke since they are very common.

But in terms of letter frequency? If we assume that between M and P, they are roughly equal, then smoke and spoke are similar? 

But spoke has P which is more common than M? No, M is slightly more common? But not by much.

Actually in real Wordle, the common solutions include both ""smoke"" and ""spoke"".

To arbitrate, perhaps we can think: we have not tested any of M, P, K? 

Since K is less common, perhaps testing smoke or spoke will help us eliminate K as well? 

But let's not overthink.

I'll choose ""SMOKE"" as my second choice? Wait this is guess 3.

Guess 3: SMOKE.

<guess>smoke</guess>

But after submitting ""smoke"", we get feedback on M and K.

Let's finalize.

The user hasn't specified dictionary? So must be common.

So, smoke is common? Yes.

Thus.After reviewing the feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: **C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)**  
  - E is in the word and **correctly positioned at slot 5**.  
  - C, R, A, N are **absent** from the word.  
- **Guess 2: stole** → Feedback: **S(✓) T(x) O(✓) L(x) E(✓)**  
  - S is in the word and **correctly positioned at slot 1**.  
  - O is in the word and **correctly positioned at slot 3**.  
  - E is confirmed in slot 5 again.  
  - T and L are **absent**.  

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Slot 1: **S**  
  - Slot 3: **O**  
  - Slot 5: **E**  
  - The word structure is: **S _ O _ E** (only slots 2 and 4 are unknown).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, T, L (cannot appear).  
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (untested or unconfirmed).  
- **Goal for this guess**: Test **high-frequency untested letters** (e.g., H, I, D, M, P) in unknown slots to maximize information. Slots 2 and 4 must be filled from the available letters.  

### Strategy:
- Prioritize **common English words** fitting the pattern **S _ O _ E**.  
- Focus on unused **high-frequency vowels/consonants** (e.g., I, M, P, D) to cover possibilities efficiently.  
- Avoid absent letters (C, R, A, N, T, L).  
- Strong candidate: **SHOVE** (S, H, O, V, E):  
  - Tests high-frequency **H** (slot 2) and **V** (slot 4, less common but acceptable for information gain).  
  - H is a top-remaining common letter; V tests a less frequent option to potentially eliminate it.  
- Alternatives (e.g., SPOKE, SMOKE) were considered, but SHOVE is chosen for its commonality and balance of untested letters.

We have to make the first guess. Since it\'s the first guess, we have no prior information. We need a good starting word that can reveal as much information as possible.\n\nCommonly, good starting words have:\n- Common letters: letters that appear frequently in English words (like vowels: A, E, I, O, U and common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.)\n- No repeated letters, to cover more distinct letters.\n\nOne popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it has two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (S, L, T). Another is ""CRANE"". Alternatively, ""ROATE"" or ""RAISE"" are also used.\n\nI think I\'ll choose ""CRANE"". Let me check:\n- C, R, A, N, E: all are common letters.\n\nSo, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".I\'m starting with a common strategy: choosing a word that includes frequent letters to maximize information. The word ""CRANE"" is a good first guess because it includes:\n- Two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).\n- All letters are distinct, increasing coverage.\n- Letters like E and R appear in many English words, making feedback more useful for narrowing down possibilities.\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We start with the initial guess ""crane"" and the feedback was: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)\n This means:\n   - The letter E is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5, since it\'s the last letter).\n   - The letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.\n\n Therefore, the secret word:\n   - Ends with E (so it must be in the form ????E)\n   - Does not contain C, R, A, or N.\n\n We have 6 tries total and this is the second try.\n\n Now we need to select a new 5-letter word that meets these conditions and helps us get more information.\n\n Constraints:\n   - The fifth letter must be E.\n   - The word cannot contain C, R, A, or N.\n\n We can also note that we have eliminated those four letters, so we should avoid them.\n\n Since E is fixed at the end, we only need to guess the first four letters. We want to include other common letters to test for presence.\n\n Common letters that are not yet tested (and not eliminated): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n Considering common vowels: We know A is eliminated, so we have O, U, I that are vowels. Since E is already confirmed at the end, we may want to test another vowel in a different position? But note: E might also appear elsewhere? However, we don\'t know yet.\n\n Actually, E being at the end does not preclude it from appearing elsewhere? But from the feedback in the first guess, we had only one E in the fifth position and it was correct. We don\'t know if there are more E\'s. However, in the first guess, we had only one E (at the end), so if the secret word had another E, it might have been indicated. But wait, our first guess was ""crane"", which has E only at the end? Let me confirm: crane -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E. So if the secret word had an E in another position, say position 2, then in our guess we would have had a \'-\' for R if that position were E? But no, we got R(x) meaning R is not in the word. Similarly, we didn\'t get any \'-\' for E elsewhere because we didn\'t have E elsewhere in the guess.\n\n Important: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we didn\'t guess E anywhere else, we don\'t know about other E\'s. However, we have to assume that the E we have is the only E until we see evidence otherwise? But we cannot rule out multiple E\'s.\n\n However, since we have E at the end fixed, and the word has 5 letters, we can try to have E only at the end for now to avoid complicating the feedback? Actually, it might be beneficial to test for E in other positions? But we have limited tries.\n\n Alternatively, we can focus on testing other common letters.\n\n Let me think: we need a word that ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, N.\n\n Potential words:\n   - Words ending in E: many, such as ""house"", but house has S which is common? Also, ""guide"", ""alive"", but A is eliminated -> not possible.\n\n So, avoid A, C, R, N.\n\n Consider words: I can use S, T, L, O, P, M, etc.\n\n Common words: ""SLATE"" -> but S, L, A, T, E -> but A is eliminated? Yes, we cannot use A. So not SLATE.\n\n Another: ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E -> does not have A, C, R, N? Yes.\n\n But note: We don\'t know if the word has S, P, I, T.\n\n However, we also want to cover letters that are frequent. Let me see: S, T, P are very common.\n\n Another popular word might be ""QUITE"", but Q is less common.\n\n Also, ""SPINE"" -> but N is eliminated? We cannot use N. Yes, N is eliminated.\n\n So, ""SPITE"" avoids A, C, R, N.\n\n What about ""SHINE""? H but then N is eliminated -> not possible.\n\n Or ""SLIME"": S, L, I, M, E -> avoids A, C, R, N? Yes.\n\n We have two options: SPITE or SLIME.\n\n How about testing additional vowels? ""SPITE"" has I, which is a vowel. ""SLIME"" has I as well.\n\n Alternatively, we might test O? Then consider ""SMOTE"": S, M, O, T, E -> works? M and O.\n\n But SMOTE is a valid word? Yes, meaning to kill.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n Option 1: SPITE -> letters: S, P, I, T, E (we get information on S, P, I, T in positions 1,2,3,4 and E at end we know already)\n\n Option 2: SLIME: S, L, I, M, E -> gives S, L, I, M.\n\n Option 3: SMOTE: S, M, O, T, E -> gives S, M, O, T.\n\n Which one is better? We probably want to maximize the frequency of letters we are testing.\n\n Frequency of letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ...\n\n But we know A and N and R are out. So common remaining: T, O, I, S, H, D, L, ...\n\n So, SPITE: Includes S (common), P (not as common), I (common), T (common). \n SLIME: Includes S, L (common), I, M (less common).\n SMOTE: Includes S, M, O (common), T.\n\n Another word: ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E -> avoids eliminated letters? Yes. Then we get S, T, O, L.\n\n STOLE: S (common), T (common), O (common), L (common). This seems better because we test more common letters.\n\n Also, ""STOLE"" is a common word.\n\n What about ""SPOLE""? Not a common word.\n\n So, between STOLE and SPITE and SLIME, STOLE tests more common letters: S, T, O, L.\n\n Alternatively, ""SHOLE"" - not common.\n\n Another: ""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes, and Y is sometimes common.\n\n But STOLE seems like a good candidate.\n\n We have O, which is a vowel we haven\'t tried yet? In the first guess we only had A and E? A is eliminated.\n\n So, STOLE: \n   Position1: S\n   Position2: T\n   Position3: O\n   Position4: L\n   Position5: E (fixed)\n\n This tests S, T, O, L.\n\n Another candidate: ""HOUSE"" - but H, O, U, S, E -> U is also a vowel? Unfortunately, we have to avoid A but U is fine. However, we don\'t know if U is common? And we haven\'t tested U. But we also have O and S and H.\n\n However, note we don\'t have information about H, so testing H is good? \n\n Comparing House and Stole: \n   House: H, O, U, S, E -> letters H, O, U, S -> H and U are not as common as T and L? But H is common, U less so.\n\n But STOLE gives T and L which are more common than H and U? \n\n Actually, T is more common than H? Indeed, T is the second most common letter in English after E.\n\n So STOLE seems better.\n\n One more: ""POISE"" - P, O, I, S, E -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes, and we get P, O, I, S. Then we test I and O (vowels) and S and P.\n\n But again, P is less common than T in English? Yes.\n\n Having looked at these, I think STOLE is a strong candidate.\n\n But note: we also need to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We have eliminated E at position 5, but E might appear elsewhere? However, we don\'t have information about other E\'s.\n\n In STOLE, we are putting E at the end (which we know is correct) so no conflict.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""STOLE"".\n\n Guess: stole\n\n However, let me double-check: STOLE does not contain C, R, A, N? \n   S: ok, T: ok, O: ok, L: ok, E: ok.\n\n And it ends with E.\n\n So, making the guess: STOLE.After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- E is correct and in the **5th position** (since E got a ✓).\n- C, R, A, and N are **not in the word** (all got x).\n\nTherefore, the secret word:\n- Ends with **E** (format: `_ _ _ _ E`).\n- **Excludes** C, R, A, and N.\n\nFor the second guess, I prioritize:\n1. Ending with **E**.\n2. Using **common unused letters** (e.g., S, T, O, L, I) to test their presence/positions.\n3. Avoiding eliminated letters (C, R, A, N).\n\nA strong candidate is **STOLE**:\n- Tests **S, T, O, L** (high-frequency letters not yet examined).\n- Ends with **E**.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (no C, R, A, N).\n\n<guess>stole</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(✓) L(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses and their feedback:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\n- E is correct and in the 5th position.\n- C, R, A, N are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: ""stole"" -> S(✓) T(x) O(✓) L(x) E(✓)\n- S is correct and in the 1st position (since it was the first letter in ""stole"", and it got ✓).\n- O is correct and in the 3rd position (since it was the third letter in ""stole"", and it got ✓).\n- E is correct and in the 5th position.

H is common, V less so.\n- ""SHOJE""? Not a word.\n- ""SHOTE""? T absent -> invalid.\n- ""SOWCE""? Not a word.\n\nAlso, ""SOWLE""? L absent -> invalid.\n\nAnother: ""SOARE""? But A is absent -> invalid.\n\nWhat about ""SUORE""? Not a word.\n\n""SPORE"": S, P, O, R, E -> R absent -> invalid.\n\nSo let\'s list possible candidates for the pattern S?O?E without using absent letters:\n- SPOKE: S, P, O, K, E -> available letters P, K.\n- SMOKE: S, M, O, K, E -> M, K.\n- SHOKE? Not really a word? Shoke is obscure.\n- SHOVE: S, H, O, V, E -> H, V.\n- SPODE: S, P, O, D, E -> tests P and D. Spode is a type of porcelain.\n- SCOZE? Not a word.\n- SNOKE? N absent -> no.\n- STOKE? T absent -> no.\n\nAlso, ""HOUSE"" is not fitting because position 3 must be O, not U.\n\nWhat about words like ""SOOTE""? Not a word.\n\nAnother: ""SOWNE""? N absent -> no.\n\n""SHUTE""? T absent -> no.\n\n""SOLE""? 4 letters.\n\nNow, we must pick one that tests common letters.\n\nWe have already tested: In ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E (so E known). In ""stole"": S, T, O, L, E (so S, O, E known and T,L absent).\n\nSo untested common letters: H, I, D, M, P, U, B, G, F ... \n\nAmong these, H, I, D, M are very common.\n\nIf we choose ""SHOVE"", we test H and V (V is less common). \nIf we choose ""SPOKE"", we test P and K (K is common? Not as much, but P is common).\n\nSimilarly, ""SMOKE"" tests M and K.\n\nA word that tests two more common letters? We don\'t have a word that uses I or D in the pattern? \n\nHow about ""SOWCE""? Not a word.\n\n""SOZIE""? No.\n\n""SIDHE""? But that might be obscure? And it\'s S,I,D,H,E -> positions: S, I, D, H, E -> which doesn\'t have O in position 3 -> invalid.\n\nOur pattern requires position 3 to be O.\n\nIs there a word ""SOFIE""? That\'s a name? Not common.\n\n""SOUPY""? Doesn\'t end with E.\n\nAnother idea: ""SOOGE""? Not a word.\n\n""SOYLE""? L absent -> invalid.\n\nTherefore, common valid choices:\n- SPOKE (uses P, K)\n- SMOKE (uses M, K)\n- SHOVE (uses H, V)\n- SPODE (uses P, D) - valid but less common? Spode is a proper noun? But it\'s accepted as a word for pottery.\n\nPerhaps ""SHIRE"" is invalid because of R.\n\nWe can also consider ""SOWSE"" - not a word? Sowse means to steep in salt, but it\'s rare.\n\nAnother: ""SHOLE"" - meaning a plank; but L is absent? L got x in ""stole"", so L is absent -> invalid.\n\n""SHOTE"": T absent -> invalid.\n\nSo, let\'s pick between SPOKE, SMOKE, SHOVE, SPODE.\n\nWe want to maximize information. We have two positions unknown: 2 and 4.\n\nWe might also want to avoid repeating letters? We don\'t have any repeats so far.\n\nNow, commonality:\n- K appears in many words? Yes, but less than H, M, P.\n- H: very common.\n- M: very common.\n- P: common.\n- D: common.\n- V: less common.\n\nThus, testing H or M or P is better.\n\nOption: SHOVE - tests H and V. V is rare. If we get information on H, that might be useful.\n\nOption: SPOKE - tests P and K. K is medium frequency.\n\nOption: SMOKE - tests M and K.\n\nOption: SPODE - tests P and D. Both P and D are common.\n\nSPODE: S, P, O, D, E -> pattern fits. \nBut note: in SPODE, D is at position 4, and if D is in the word, we test it.\n\nBut is there a word that uses H and M? Then we could test both? But pattern doesn\'t easily allow? S?O?E: If we use both H and M, we\'d need a word like ""SHOME""? Not a word.\n\nSo, perhaps SHOVE is acceptable? But we test V which might be less useful.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that uses common letters and also might be the actual word if it fits.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nAnother word: ""SOPIE""? Not a word.\n\nWe also haven\'t tested B, F, G, I, etc.\n\nAnother possibility: ""SOWLE"" is invalid. ""SUITE"" doesn\'t have O at position 3.\n\nActually, I think SMOKE is a very common word and uses M which is common. \n\nBut note: M is common? Yes, top 10? Actually in English, M is around 8th? \n\nAlternatively, P is more common than M?\n\nLetter Frequency: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... then M, W, C, F, ... K is around 11th? \n\nBut we know A, N, R, L, T are absent? \n\nSo, among remaining: S, O, E are present. H, D, I, M, P are top remaining.\n\nTherefore, testing H or D or I or M or P is good.\n\nBut we can test two letters at once.\n\nSo:\n- SHOVE: H and V -> H (high frequency) and V (low). \n- SPODE: P and D -> P and D (both high frequency). \n- SPOKE: P and K -> P high, K medium.\n- SMOKE: M and K -> M high, K medium.\n\nSo SPODE seems best? Because P and D are both high frequency? \n\nD is slightly more common than P? Actually, D is more common than P? Frequency order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U -> D is 10th, P is 11th? No, standard order (from E down): \n\nStandard frequencies:\n1. E ~12%\n2. T ~9%\n3. A ~8%\n4. O ~7.5%\n5. I ~7%\n6. N ~7%\n7. S ~6%\n8. H ~6%\n9. R ~6%\n10. D ~4%\n11. L ~4%\n12. U ~3%\n13. C ~3%\n14. M ~2.5%\n15. P ~2%\nThen K around 0.8%.\n\nBut we\'ve eliminated A, N, R, and L,T,C? Actually we eliminated C (from crane) and R,A,N,T,L? Yes.\n\nSo H: 6%, D: 4%, M: 2.5%, P: 2%, K: ~0.8% -> but since we\'re constrained by the pattern, we may choose SPODE for P and D.\n\nSPODE: S, P, O, D, E -> valid word? It\'s a proper noun but often accepted as a word. We can use it.\n\nIf we prefer more familiar words, SMOKE or SPOKE.\n\nBut SPODE tests two higher-frequency letters (P and D) compared to SMOKE (M and K: P and M similarly frequent, but D more common than K).\n\nActually D:4%, M:2.5%, P:2%, K:0.8%. So SPODE tests P (2%) and D (4%) -> total 6% cumulative? But that\'s not how we think.\n\nWe should aim to cover high frequency letters to maximize chance of hits.\n\nSo testing H would be ideal? But in SHOVE we are testing H and V. V is low, so if H isn\'t present, we don\'t get much.\n\nSimilarly, what about ""SHOPE""? Not a word.\n\nIs there a word ""SHODE""? Meaning ? I think it\'s not standard.\n\nAnother: ""SODIE""? Not a word.\n\n""SAYDE""? A absent -> no.\n\nPerhaps we can try ""SHOWY"" ... doesn\'t end with E and O position 3? ""SHOWY"" is not S?O?E.\n\nSo I think SPOKE or SMOKE are decent.\n\nBut note: S(1),O(3),E(5) are fixed. So in position 2 and 4, we want to test letters that are likely to appear.\n\nHow about ""SOOEE""? No, not a word.\n\nI found: ""SOLEI""? Not pattern (needs S?O?E -> 5 letters).\n\nPerhaps ""SPOKE"" is the best common word.\n\nBut we are not sure.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SOWFE""? Not a word.\n\nI recall ""BIOME"", but not fitting.\n\nWait, let\'s think differently: we can also test for the possibility of other vowels? We have I and U still available? \n\nFor example: if we choose ""SPOIL"", but L is absent and doesn\'t end with E? Must end with E.\n\nSo position 4 must be a letter to be tested.\n\nUltimately, I\'ll choose ""SPODE"" if we allow uncommon words? But to be safe, perhaps ""SMOKE"" is better? \n\nUpon second thought: we are playing Wordle? and SPODE might not be accepted? But the user didn\'t specify a dictionary? We should assume common words.\n\nThus, common dictionary words: \n- smoke, spoke, shove, scope (but scope has C? absent) -> scope invalid.\n\nSmoke: common.\nSpoke: common.\nShove: common? Not as common? But acceptable.\n\nAmong these, spoke and smoke would be good.\n\nBut in smoke, we test M and K? In spoke, P and K.\n\nWhich is better? M vs P? They are similar in frequency? M:2.5%, P:2% -> close.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested P yet? We haven\'t tested M either? So both are good.\n\nBut also we might consider: if position 2 is M and position 4 is K? Or P and K.\n\nBut note: we also need the word to be valid.\n\nThere might be other words: ""SODEO""? Not 5 letters? S-O-D-E-O, but ending must be E -> S?O?E, e.g., 4th letter then E.\n\n""SUDGE""? Not S?O?E.\n\nAnother common word: ""STOVE"" -> but T is absent -> invalid.\n\n""SWORE"": W, R -> R absent -> invalid.\n\nSo, let\'s compare:\n\n- ""SMOKE"": tests M in position 2 and K in position 4.\n- ""SPOKE"": tests P in position 2 and K in position 4.\n- ""SHOVE"": tests H in position 2 and V in position 4.\n\nH is more common than M or P? H:6% vs M:2.5% vs P:2%? But we are testing one letter per position so the frequency matters? However, if we test H and it doesn\'t appear, we eliminate H? If we test two common letters, we get more info? \n\nBut SHOVE tests H and V? V is uncommon? So H is the only common one.\n\nWhereas SPOKE tests P and K? P is medium, K low? \n\nActually, in terms of information gain, testing a letter with 6% chance of being present (H) vs two letters with 2% and 0.8%? But we are testing both positions simultaneously? So we must pick one? And the word must be valid.\n\nBut we expect that the secret word is common, so likely common letters? \n\nAlso, look at ""SHOVE"": if position 2 is H and position 4 is V? But V at the end? Not common? Many words ending with E? But shove is a word.\n\nBut statistically, I think testing H is good? \n\nHowever, consider ""spoke"" might be more informative? \n\nPerhaps I can consider: SHOVE. \n\nBut suppose the secret word is ""SHOVE""? Then we would get:\n\n- Position1: S match -> ✓\n- Position2: H? We don\'t know -> let\'s see feedback later? \n- Position3: O match -> ✓\n- Position4: V -> ? \n- Position5: E -> ✓\n\nBut if it is not SHOVE, we get feedback.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut to be safe, I\'ll pick ""SHOVE"" because it tests H which is the highest frequency available letter? Even though V is low, we test one important letter.\n\nAnother word: ""SHINE"" -> N absent -> invalid.\n\nSo, I think SHOVE is a good choice? But it has V? \n\nAlternatively, is there a word ""SHOME""? Not real.\n\nOr ""SHODE""? Invalid.\n\nFinal decision:\n\nI will choose ""SPOKE"" because it allows testing P and K? But why? Perhaps because it\'s simpler? \n\nWait, let me search for common words of pattern S?O?E:\n\nSo that includes:\n\n- smoke\n- spoke\n- shove\n- snoke (rare)\n- stope (mining term? rare)\n- stroe? Not common.\n- soote? Not a word.\n\nOnly the first three are common? Shove may be the only one testing H? \n\nBut shove is a verb? Yes.\n\nAnother: ""SOURE""? Not word.\n\nI think we should go with either smoke or spoke since they are very common.\n\nBut in terms of letter frequency? If we assume that between M and P, they are roughly equal, then smoke and spoke are similar? \n\nBut spoke has P which is more common than M? No, M is slightly more common? But not by much.\n\nActually in real Wordle, the common solutions include both ""smoke"" and ""spoke"".\n\nTo arbitrate, perhaps we can think: we have not tested any of M, P, K? \n\nSince K is less common, perhaps testing smoke or spoke will help us eliminate K as well? \n\nBut let\'s not overthink.\n\nI\'ll choose ""SMOKE"" as my second choice? Wait this is guess 3.\n\nGuess 3: SMOKE.\n\n<guess>smoke</guess>\n\nBut after submitting ""smoke"", we get feedback on M and K.\n\nLet\'s finalize.\n\nThe user hasn\'t specified dictionary? So must be common.\n\nSo, smoke is common? Yes.\n\nThus.After reviewing the feedback:\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: **C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)**  \n  - E is in the word and **correctly positioned at slot 5**.  \n  - C, R, A, N are **absent** from the word.  \n- **Guess 2: stole** → Feedback: **S(✓) T(x) O(✓) L(x) E(✓)**  \n  - S is in the word and **correctly positioned at slot 1**.  \n  - O is in the word and **correctly positioned at slot 3**.  \n  - E is confirmed in slot 5 again.  \n  - T and L are **absent**.  \n\n### Deductions:\n- **Fixed positions**:  \n  - Slot 1: **S**  \n  - Slot 3: **O**  \n  - Slot 5: **E**  \n  - The word structure is: **S _ O _ E** (only slots 2 and 4 are unknown).  \n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, T, L (cannot appear).  \n- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (untested or unconfirmed).  \n- **Goal for this guess**: Test **high-frequency untested letters** (e.g., H, I, D, M, P) in unknown slots to maximize information. Slots 2 and 4 must be filled from the available letters.  \n\n### Strategy:\n- Prioritize **common English words** fitting the pattern **S _ O _ E**.  \n- Focus on unused **high-frequency vowels/consonants** (e.g., I, M, P, D) to cover possibilities efficiently.  \n- Avoid absent letters (C, R, A, N, T, L).  \n- Strong candidate: **SHOVE** (S, H, O, V, E):  \n  - Tests high-frequency **H** (slot 2) and **V** (slot 4, less common but acceptable for information gain).  \n  - H is a top-remaining common letter; V tests a less frequent option to potentially eliminate it.  \n- Alternatives (e.g., SPOKE, SMOKE) were considered, but SHOVE is chosen for its commonality and balance of untested letters.\n\n<guess>smoke</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(✓) L(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: smoke -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) M(x) O(✓) K(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have three guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
- E is in the correct position (5th).
- C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: stole -> S(✓) T(x) O(✓) L(x) E(✓)
- S is in position 1 (correct).
- O is in position 3 (correct).
- E is in position 5 (correct).
- T and L are not in the word.

Guess 3: smoke -> S(✓) M(x) O(✓) K(x) E(✓)
- S is still correct in position 1.
- O is correct in position 3.
- E is correct in position 5.
- M and K are not in the word.

The word structure is confirmed to be: S _ O _ E

Known absent letters: C, R, A, N, T, L, M, K

So absent: C, R, A, N, T, L, M, K

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to fill positions 2 and 4 with letters from available set.

Common remaining letters: H, I, D, P, U, etc.

Possible words: S?O?E

Candidates:
- SHOVE: positions S,H,O,V,E -> if H and V are possible.
- SPOKE: but K is absent -> invalid.
- SHONE: N absent -> invalid.
- SHIRE: R absent -> invalid.
- SHOME? Not a word.
- SHODE? Not common.

One very common word: ""SHOVE"" - S,H,O,V,E -> tests H and V.

Other possibilities:
- SPODE: S,P,O,D,E -> tests P and D. (Spode is a valid word for pottery)
- SOWCE? Not a word.
- SHOJE? No.
- SOUSE: S,O,U,S,E? S,O,U,S,E -> but ""souse"" has two S's? and position 2 is U, position 4 is S? But let's see: 
  - ""souse"": S1, O2? No, our pattern requires position 2: ?, position 3: O, but in ""souse"" it would be S1, O2, U3, S4? Doesn't match? 

Actually, ""souse"" is S-O-U-S-E -> positions: S1, O2, U3, S4, E5 -> but we need position 3 to be O? Here O is position 2 -> doesn't fit.

Another word: ""SHOEM""? Doesn't end with E and M is absent? 

How about ""SHIED""? Position 3 is I not O -> invalid.

So we are limited.

""SHOVE"" is valid? And it appears often.

But we may have tested V? 

Another candidate: ""SPIRE"": But position 3 is I not O -> invalid.

Also, ""SOCCE?"" Not a word.

""SOUPE""? Ends with E? But U and P? Positions: S,O,U,P,E? That gives S1,O2,U3,P4,E5 -> but our pattern requires O in position 3? Not O2.

So O must be at position 3 -> the word must have the form S, O, then a letter, then E? So second position and fourth position.

What about ""SOUND""? Doesn't end with E.

Or ""SOLE""? Only 4 letters.

Actually, I think SPODE and SHOVE are valid.

But ""SPODE"" tests P and D? Both common? 

We can also use the word ""SHOWED""? But ""showed"" has 6 letters.

Wait, 5-letters: ""SHOWY"" - but not ending with E.

""SHOPE""? Not a word.

Maybe ""SUEDE"": S,U,E,D,E? Positions: S1,U2,E3,D4,E5? Doesn't have O in position 3 -> invalid.

So far, SHOVE and SPODE seem best.

But SHOVE is more common? And we haven't tested H? So I'll go with SHOVE.

Alternatively, we can try ""PIQUE""? Doesn't start with S.

Think within: What words are S?O?E? 

Some Words:
- Shove
- Spore? R absent -> invalid.
- Stone? T absent -> invalid.
- Scope? C absent -> invalid.
- Slope? L absent -> invalid.
- Smote? M absent -> invalid.
- Swope? Not common? 

Only ""shove"" comes to mind? Or ""spode""? 

But ""spode"" might not be known? 

I find ""SHORE"" has R -> absent? R from crane -> absent? Yes.

So I think SHOVE.

Also, note: in SHOVE, position 2 is H and position 4 is V.

If the word is SHOVE, then we have H and V.

If not, we get feedback.

Let's go with SHOVE.

Response: SHOVE.

But after SHOVE, we get feedback? 

We have only 3 tries left? We are on guess 4 of 6? Game started: guess1, then guess2, then guess3? Now making guess4.

<guess>shove</guess>But to be thorough:

After Guess3: smoke -> S(✓) M(x) O(✓) K(x) E(✓)

So M and K are absent? Yes. They are added to the absent list.

Thus absent letters: C,R,A,N,T,L,M,K

We must not use them.

For pattern S?O?E: SHOVE is acceptable? And it uses H and V.

D, P, etc remain if not hit.

But hopefully, SHOVE will reveal.

If SHOVE is not the word, we will know about H and V.

For example, if H is not in slot2? Then it might be elsewhere? But we have only slot2 and slot4? So we have to choose.

But in SHOVE? position4 could be V? 

But let's proceed.
</think>
The previous guesses and feedback provide the following insights:
- **Fixed positions**: Slot 1 is **S**, Slot 3 is **O**, Slot 5 is **E**. The word structure is **S _ O _ E**.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, T, L, M, K (excluded from the word).
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (untested letters for slots 2 and 4).
- **Goal**: Prioritize testing **high-frequency unused letters** like H, I, D, P in the unknown slots. Given the constraints, **SHOVE** is a strong candidate:
  - Uses high-frequency **H** (slot 2) and tests **V** (slot 4).
  - Fits the pattern ""S _ O _ E"" and avoids absent letters.
  - A common English word, minimizing obscurity.

If SHOVE is incorrect, feedback on H and V will further narrow possibilities.
