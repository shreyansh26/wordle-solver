We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (position 2)
 A: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (position 3? Actually, in ""crane"", A is at position 3, but note: positions are 1-indexed? Let's note the positions: 
   c (1), r (2), a (3), n (4), e (5)
 So, R is at position 2 and is correct, meaning the secret word has R at position 2.
 A is at position 3 and is correct, meaning the secret word has A at position 3.
 E is at position 5 and is correct, meaning the secret word has E at position 5.
 C and N are not in the word.

 Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R A _ E

 We know the letters C and N are not in the word.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We want to try to find the missing letters (first and fourth) and also confirm any other letters.

 Since we have three fixed letters (R at 2, A at 3, E at 5) and we know two letters that are not present (C and N), we can choose a word that:
   - Has the fixed letters in the same positions: positions 2, 3, and 5 must be R, A, E respectively.
   - The first and fourth positions should be new letters that we haven't tried (avoid C and N) and that are common.

 We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let's think of words that fit the pattern: [letter1] R A [letter4] E

 We know letter1 and letter4 cannot be C or N.

 Some possibilities: 
   grape -> G at 1, P at 4
   drape -> D at 1, P at 4
   trace -> but T at 1, C at 4 -> but C is already known to be absent, so not valid.
   brave -> B at 1, V at 4 -> but we haven't tried B or V.

 However, note that in the first guess we only know that C and N are absent. We don't know about other letters.

 We can also consider that we might have repeated letters? But the feedback didn't show any, and we don't have evidence of duplicates yet.

 Let's list some words that fit the pattern: _ R A _ E

 5-letter words ending with E, with R at position 2 and A at position 3:
   brace -> but B at 1, C at 4 -> C is absent, so invalid.
   brake -> B at 1, K at 4
   brave -> B at 1, V at 4
   drake -> D at 1, K at 4
   drape -> D at 1, P at 4
   frame -> F at 1, M at 4
   grace -> G at 1, C at 4 -> C absent, invalid.
   grade -> G at 1, D at 4
   grape -> G at 1, P at 4
   grave -> G at 1, V at 4
   trace -> T at 1, C at 4 -> C absent, invalid.
   trade -> T at 1, D at 4

 We can choose any of the valid ones. We want to test new letters to get more information.

 Since we have two missing letters, we might want to choose a word that uses common consonants and that we haven't tried.

 We have not tried: B, D, F, G, K, M, P, T, V, etc.

 We can choose ""brake"" to test B and K. Or ""drape"" to test D and P.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters that are more common.

 Let's pick ""brake"": 
   B is a common starting letter, and K is a common ending consonant.

 But note: we are also testing the letter B at position 1 and K at position 4.

 However, we must be cautious: if the word is ""brave"", then we would get B correct and K wrong, but we wouldn't know about V.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters that are more likely to appear in many words? 

 Another idea: we can choose a word that doesn't use the same letter twice and uses letters we haven't tried.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can afford to test multiple letters.

 Let's choose ""drape"" because D and P are common.

 But note: we are also testing the pattern. If we get feedback that D is in the word and in the correct position, then we know the first letter is D. Similarly for P.

 However, we don't know if the first letter is D or not. So by using ""drape"", we are testing two new letters at once.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has many new letters and doesn't repeat.

 Let me choose ""brake"" for the second guess.

 But wait, we have to consider that the first letter might be a vowel? Actually, we already have two vowels (A and E) and one consonant (R). The first letter is likely a consonant.

 After thinking, I decide to go with ""brake"".

 So, second guess: ""brake""

 However, let me check: 
   b r a k e
   positions: 1: B, 2: R (fixed), 3: A (fixed), 4: K, 5: E (fixed)

 We are testing B and K.

 But note: we are also testing the entire pattern. If the word is ""brake"", we win. Otherwise, we get feedback on B and K.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more common letters? 

 Another candidate: ""trade"" -> T at 1, D at 4. We haven't tried T or D.

 But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C and N are absent, so T and D are safe.

 However, ""trade"" has the advantage that D is a common letter.

 But let's look at the frequency: 
   In English, the most common consonants are T, R, S, ... but we already have R.

 We can also consider ""grade"": G at 1, D at 4.

 I think ""grade"" is a good choice because G and D are common.

 However, we are trying to maximize information. We can also consider that we have only one chance to test two new letters.

 I'll go with ""grade"" because it uses G and D, which are both common.

 So, second guess: ""grade""

 But wait, we have to make sure that we are not using any excluded letters. We know C and N are excluded. G and D are not excluded.

 Therefore, let's guess ""grade"".

<guess>grade</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C (position 1) is absent (x), so the secret word does not contain C.
- R (position 2) is correct (✓), so the secret word has R in position 2.
- A (position 3) is correct (✓), so the secret word has A in position 3.
- N (position 4) is absent (x), so the secret word does not contain N.
- E (position 5) is correct (✓), so the secret word has E in position 5.

The secret word pattern is: _ R A _ E  
Absent letters: C, N  

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Maintain R, A, E in positions 2, 3, and 5.
2. Test new letters in positions 1 and 4 (avoiding C and N).
3. Prioritize common letters to maximize information.

I chose ""grade"" because:
- It fits the pattern (_ R A _ E) with G in position 1 and D in position 4.
- G and D are common consonants not yet tested.
- This tests two new letters simultaneously, helping identify the missing characters efficiently.

- C (position 1) is absent (x), so the secret word does not contain C.
- R (position 2) is correct (✓), so the secret word has R in position 2.
- A (position 3) is correct (✓), so the secret word has A in position 3.
- N (position 4) is absent (x), so the secret word does not contain N.
- E (position 5) is correct (✓), so the secret word has E in position 5.

The secret word pattern is: _ R A _ E  
Absent letters: C, N  

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Maintain R, A, E in positions 2, 3, and 5.
2. Test new letters in positions 1 and 4 (avoiding C and N).
3. Prioritize common letters to maximize information.

I chose ""grade"" because:
- It fits the pattern (_ R A _ E) with G in position 1 and D in position 4.
- G and D are common consonants not yet tested.
- This tests two new letters simultaneously, helping identify the missing characters efficiently.

We are given feedback for the second guess ""grade"":

 R: ✓ -> already known to be correct at position 2
 A: ✓ -> already known to be correct at position 3
 D: x -> not in the word
 E: ✓ -> already known to be correct at position 5

 So, from the feedback of ""grade"":
 - G is correct at position 1. Therefore, the secret word starts with G.
 - D is not in the word.

 Now, combining with previous feedback:
   Secret word pattern: G R A _ E   (positions: 1=G, 2=R, 3=A, 5=E)
   Absent letters: C, N, D

 We now know the first letter is G, so the word is ""G R A _ E"".

 We need to find the fourth letter. It cannot be C, N, or D.

 We must choose a word that fits the known pattern and tests the fourth position.

 However, note that we have only one missing letter (the fourth) and we know the rest.

 But wait: we must also consider that there might be duplicate letters? However, we have no indication of duplicates so far.

 Since we know four letters and only one is missing, we can try to guess the word by testing possible letters for the fourth position.

 What are possible letters for the fourth position? We need to form a valid English word.

 Possible words: 
   grace -> but C is absent, so invalid.
   grape -> P is a possibility (and we haven't tested P)
   grave -> V is a possibility
   grate -> T is a possibility (but note: we haven't tested T, but T is common)
   gaze -> only 4 letters, not 5.
   grame -> not a common word? (but let's check: it might be a variant, but we should stick to common words)
   grape, grave, grate, grase (not a word), graze -> Z is a possibility.

 Common words: 
   grape, grave, grate, graze, etc.

 We know D is absent, so ""grade"" is out.

 We can make a guess that uses one of these and also tests the fourth letter.

 However, we have 4 known letters and only one unknown. We can try to guess one of the possibilities.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test multiple possibilities? Actually, we can try to guess the word directly.

 However, we might not get it on the first try of the possibilities, and we have 4 tries left.

 Alternatively, we can make a guess that uses the known pattern and introduces new letters to test? But we only have one missing letter.

 But wait: what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, if the word is ""grace"", but C is absent so that's not possible. Or ""grape"" has no duplicates.

 Since we have no evidence of duplicates, we can assume the fourth letter is a new letter.

 We can try to guess ""grape"" to test P. If it's correct, we win. If not, we know P is absent and we can try another.

 But we can also try to use a word that has the known pattern and also tests other letters that might be in the word? However, the word is almost complete.

 Let me list the possible common words that fit ""G R A _ E"":
   grape (P)
   grave (V)
   grate (T)
   graze (Z)
   grace (C) -> but C is absent, so invalid.
   grade (D) -> but D is absent, so invalid.
   graze is a word.

 Other less common: grame (not common), grafe (not a word), etc.

 We have four possibilities: P, V, T, Z.

 We can try to guess one of them. But if we guess wrong, we get information about that letter.

 Alternatively, we can make a guess that uses the pattern and also includes other letters that we haven't tested? But we don't have any other missing positions.

 However, note: we have to fill the fourth position. We cannot leave it blank.

 We can try to use a word that has the known letters (G, R, A, E) in the correct positions and a new letter in the fourth, and also includes other new letters? But that's not possible because the word must be 5 letters and we have fixed positions 1,2,3,5.

 The fourth position is the only one we can change.

 Therefore, we must choose a word that is ""G R A ? E"", and the ? is a letter we haven't tried and that is not absent.

 We have not tried: B, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know C, N, D are absent).

 But we are limited to words that exist.

 So, we can try:

 Option 1: Guess ""grape"" to test P. If P is correct, we win. If not, then P is absent and we try another.

 Option 2: Similarly, we can try ""grave"" for V.

 But we have 4 tries left, so we can try one.

 However, we can also consider: what if we use a word that doesn't have the pattern but tests multiple possible letters at once? 

 For example, we could use a word that has P, V, T, Z in it? But we don't have a position for them? 

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has the known letters in the correct positions and then the fourth letter is one of the candidates? That's what we are doing.

 But note: we cannot test multiple candidates at once because the fourth position can only be one letter.

 So, we have to test one by one.

 However, we can also use a word that has the known pattern and also includes a letter that is not in the word? That wouldn't help.

 Therefore, I think the best is to try one of the candidates.

 Let's choose the most common word: ""grape"" is common.

 But note: we have to consider the frequency of letters. P is a common letter.

 Alternatively, we can look at the list of possible words and see which one is more likely.

 Without frequency data, we can choose arbitrarily.

 I'll choose ""grape"" for the third guess.

 So, guess: ""grape""

 But wait, what if the word is ""grave""? Then we get feedback that P is absent and we know to try V next.

 Similarly, if we get all correct, we win.

 So, let's do that.

After analyzing the feedback from the second guess ""grade"":
- G (position 1) is correct (✓), confirming the secret word starts with G.
- R (position 2) and A (position 3) remain correct (✓), consistent with the first guess.
- D (position 4) is absent (x), so D is not in the secret word.
- E (position 5) remains correct (✓).

### Updated Information:
- **Secret word pattern**: G R A _ E  
  (positions: 1=G, 2=R, 3=A, 5=E; position 4 is unknown).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, D (cannot appear anywhere).
- **Known present letters**: G, R, A, E (all fixed in positions except G is now confirmed at position 1).

### Strategy for the Third Guess:
- The secret word is **G R A _ E**, with only the fourth letter missing.
- Possible letters for position 4 must form valid English words (e.g., P for ""grape"", V for ""grave"", T for ""grate"", Z for ""graze"").
- Since C, N, and D are absent, options like ""grace"" or ""grade"" are invalid.
- Goal: Test the most common candidate for position 4 while maximizing efficiency. ""Grape"" is a high-frequency word and tests P, a common consonant not yet evaluated.

### Why ""grape""?
- Tests P in position 4.

- If P is absent, we eliminate it and proceed with other candidates (e.g., V, T, Z) in future guesses.

 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (position 2)
 A: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (position 3? Actually, in ""crane"", A is at position 3, but note: positions are 1-indexed? Let's note the positions: 
   c (1), r (2), a (3), n (4), e (5)
 So, R is at position 2 and is correct, meaning the secret word has R at position 2.
 A is at position 3 and is correct, meaning the secret word has A at position 3.
 E is at position 5 and is correct, meaning the secret word has E at position 5.
 C and N are not in the word.

 Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R A _ E

 We know the letters C and N are not in the word.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We want to try to find the missing letters (first and fourth) and also confirm any other letters.

 Since we have three fixed letters (R at 2, A at 3, E at 5) and we know two letters that are not present (C and N), we can choose a word that:
   - Has the fixed letters in the same positions: positions 2, 3, and 5 must be R, A, E respectively.
   - The first and fourth positions should be new letters that we haven't tried (avoid C and N) and that are common.

 We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let's think of words that fit the pattern: [letter1] R A [letter4] E

 We know letter1 and letter4 cannot be C or N.

 Some possibilities: 
   grape -> G at 1, P at 4
   drape -> D at 1, P at 4
   trace -> but T at 1, C at 4 -> but C is already known to be absent, so not valid.
   brave -> B at 1, V at 4 -> but we haven't tried B or V.

 However, note that in the first guess we only know that C and N are absent. We don't know about other letters.

 We can also consider that we might have repeated letters? But the feedback didn't show any, and we don't have evidence of duplicates yet.

 Let's list some words that fit the pattern: _ R A _ E

 5-letter words ending with E, with R at position 2 and A at position 3:
   brace -> but B at 1, C at 4 -> C is absent, so invalid.
   brake -> B at 1, K at 4
   brave -> B at 1, V at 4
   drake -> D at 1, K at 4
   drape -> D at 1, P at 4
   frame -> F at 1, M at 4
   grace -> G at 1, C at 4 -> C absent, invalid.
   grade -> G at 1, D at 4
   grape -> G at 1, P at 4
   grave -> G at 1, V at 4
   trace -> T at 1, C at 4 -> C absent, invalid.
   trade -> T at 1, D at 4

 We can choose any of the valid ones. We want to test new letters to get more information.

 Since we have two missing letters, we might want to choose a word that uses common consonants and that we haven't tried.

 We have not tried: B, D, F, G, K, M, P, T, V, etc.

 We can choose ""brake"" to test B and K. Or ""drape"" to test D and P.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters that are more common.

 Let's pick ""brake"": 
   B is a common starting letter, and K is a common ending consonant.

 But note: we are also testing the letter B at position 1 and K at position 4.

 However, we must be cautious: if the word is ""brave"", then we would get B correct and K wrong, but we wouldn't know about V.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters that are more likely to appear in many words? 

 Another idea: we can choose a word that doesn't use the same letter twice and uses letters we haven't tried.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can afford to test multiple letters.

 Let's choose ""drape"" because D and P are common.

 But note: we are also testing the pattern. If we get feedback that D is in the word and in the correct position, then we know the first letter is D. Similarly for P.

 However, we don't know if the first letter is D or not. So by using ""drape"", we are testing two new letters at once.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has many new letters and doesn't repeat.

 Let me choose ""brake"" for the second guess.

 But wait, we have to consider that the first letter might be a vowel? Actually, we already have two vowels (A and E) and one consonant (R). The first letter is likely a consonant.

 After thinking, I decide to go with ""brake"".

 So, second guess: ""brake""

 However, let me check: 
   b r a k e
   positions: 1: B, 2: R (fixed), 3: A (fixed), 4: K, 5: E (fixed)

 We are testing B and K.

 But note: we are also testing the entire pattern. If the word is ""brake"", we win. Otherwise, we get feedback on B and K.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more common letters? 

 Another candidate: ""trade"" -> T at 1, D at 4. We haven't tried T or D.

 But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C and N are absent, so T and D are safe.

 However, ""trade"" has the advantage that D is a common letter.

 But let's look at the frequency: 
   In English, the most common consonants are T, R, S, ... but we already have R.

 We can also consider ""grade"": G at 1, D at 4.

 I think ""grade"" is a good choice because G and D are common.

 However, we are trying to maximize information. We can also consider that we have only one chance to test two new letters.

 I'll go with ""grade"" because it uses G and D, which are both common.

 So, second guess: ""grade""

 But wait, we have to make sure that we are not using any excluded letters. We know C and N are excluded. G and D are not excluded.

 Therefore, let's guess ""grade"".

<guess>grade</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C (position 1) is absent (x), so the secret word does not contain C.
- R (position 2) is correct (✓), so the secret word has R in position 2.
- A (position 3) is correct (✓), so the secret word has A in position 3.
- N (position 4) is absent (x), so the secret word does not contain N.
- E (position 5) is correct (✓), so the secret word has E in position 5.

The secret word pattern is: _ R A _ E  
Absent letters: C, N  

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Maintain R, A, E in positions 2, 3, and 5.
2. Test new letters in positions 1 and 4 (avoiding C and N).
3. Prioritize common letters to maximize information.

I chose ""grade"" because:
- It fits the pattern (_ R A _ E) with G in position 1 and D in position 4.
- G and D are common consonants not yet tested.
- This tests two new letters simultaneously, helping identify the missing characters efficiently.

<guess>grade</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: grade -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) R(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the second guess ""grade"":
 G: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (position 1)
 R: ✓ -> already known to be correct at position 2
 A: ✓ -> already known to be correct at position 3
 D: x -> not in the word
 E: ✓ -> already known to be correct at position 5

 So, from the feedback of ""grade"":
 - G is correct at position 1. Therefore, the secret word starts with G.
 - D is not in the word.

 Now, combining with previous feedback:
   Secret word pattern: G R A _ E   (positions: 1=G, 2=R, 3=A, 5=E)
   Absent letters: C, N, D

 We now know the first letter is G, so the word is ""G R A _ E"".

 We need to find the fourth letter. It cannot be C, N, or D.

 We must choose a word that fits the known pattern and tests the fourth position.

 However, note that we have only one missing letter (the fourth) and we know the rest.

 But wait: we must also consider that there might be duplicate letters? However, we have no indication of duplicates so far.

 Since we know four letters and only one is missing, we can try to guess the word by testing possible letters for the fourth position.

 What are possible letters for the fourth position? We need to form a valid English word.

 Possible words: 
   grace -> but C is absent, so invalid.
   grape -> P is a possibility (and we haven't tested P)
   grave -> V is a possibility
   grate -> T is a possibility (but note: we haven't tested T, but T is common)
   gaze -> only 4 letters, not 5.
   grame -> not a common word? (but let's check: it might be a variant, but we should stick to common words)
   grape, grave, grate, grase (not a word), graze -> Z is a possibility.

 Common words: 
   grape, grave, grate, graze, etc.

 We know D is absent, so ""grade"" is out.

 We can make a guess that uses one of these and also tests the fourth letter.

 However, we have 4 known letters and only one unknown. We can try to guess one of the possibilities.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test multiple possibilities? Actually, we can try to guess the word directly.

 However, we might not get it on the first try of the possibilities, and we have 4 tries left.

 Alternatively, we can make a guess that uses the known pattern and introduces new letters to test? But we only have one missing letter.

 But wait: what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, if the word is ""grace"", but C is absent so that's not possible. Or ""grape"" has no duplicates.

 Since we have no evidence of duplicates, we can assume the fourth letter is a new letter.

 We can try to guess ""grape"" to test P. If it's correct, we win. If not, we know P is absent and we can try another.

 But we can also try to use a word that has the known pattern and also tests other letters that might be in the word? However, the word is almost complete.

 Let me list the possible common words that fit ""G R A _ E"":
   grape (P)
   grave (V)
   grate (T)
   graze (Z)
   grace (C) -> but C is absent, so invalid.
   grade (D) -> but D is absent, so invalid.
   graze is a word.

 Other less common: grame (not common), grafe (not a word), etc.

 We have four possibilities: P, V, T, Z.

 We can try to guess one of them. But if we guess wrong, we get information about that letter.

 Alternatively, we can make a guess that uses the pattern and also includes other letters that we haven't tested? But we don't have any other missing positions.

 However, note: we have to fill the fourth position. We cannot leave it blank.

 We can try to use a word that has the known letters (G, R, A, E) in the correct positions and a new letter in the fourth, and also includes other new letters? But that's not possible because the word must be 5 letters and we have fixed positions 1,2,3,5.

 The fourth position is the only one we can change.

 Therefore, we must choose a word that is ""G R A ? E"", and the ? is a letter we haven't tried and that is not absent.

 We have not tried: B, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know C, N, D are absent).

 But we are limited to words that exist.

 So, we can try:

 Option 1: Guess ""grape"" to test P. If P is correct, we win. If not, then P is absent and we try another.

 Option 2: Similarly, we can try ""grave"" for V.

 But we have 4 tries left, so we can try one.

 However, we can also consider: what if we use a word that doesn't have the pattern but tests multiple possible letters at once? 

 For example, we could use a word that has P, V, T, Z in it? But we don't have a position for them? 

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has the known letters in the correct positions and then the fourth letter is one of the candidates? That's what we are doing.

 But note: we cannot test multiple candidates at once because the fourth position can only be one letter.

 So, we have to test one by one.

 However, we can also use a word that has the known pattern and also includes a letter that is not in the word? That wouldn't help.

 Therefore, I think the best is to try one of the candidates.

 Let's choose the most common word: ""grape"" is common.

 But note: we have to consider the frequency of letters. P is a common letter.

 Alternatively, we can look at the list of possible words and see which one is more likely.

 Without frequency data, we can choose arbitrarily.

 I'll choose ""grape"" for the third guess.

 So, guess: ""grape""

 But wait, what if the word is ""grave""? Then we get feedback that P is absent and we know to try V next.

 Similarly, if we get all correct, we win.

 So, let's do that.

<guess>grape</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the second guess ""grade"":
- G (position 1) is correct (✓), confirming the secret word starts with G.
- R (position 2) and A (position 3) remain correct (✓), consistent with the first guess.
- D (position 4) is absent (x), so D is not in the secret word.
- E (position 5) remains correct (✓).

### Updated Information:
- **Secret word pattern**: G R A _ E  
  (positions: 1=G, 2=R, 3=A, 5=E; position 4 is unknown).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, D (cannot appear anywhere).
- **Known present letters**: G, R, A, E (all fixed in positions except G is now confirmed at position 1).

### Strategy for the Third Guess:
- The secret word is **G R A _ E**, with only the fourth letter missing.
- Possible letters for position 4 must form valid English words (e.g., P for ""grape"", V for ""grave"", T for ""grate"", Z for ""graze"").
- Since C, N, and D are absent, options like ""grace"" or ""grade"" are invalid.
- Goal: Test the most common candidate for position 4 while maximizing efficiency. ""Grape"" is a high-frequency word and tests P, a common consonant not yet evaluated.

### Why ""grape""?
- Tests P in position 4.
- If correct, the puzzle is solved.
- If P is absent, we eliminate it and proceed with other candidates (e.g., V, T, Z) in future guesses.

 So, from this we know that the secret word is ""G R A _ E"", and the fourth letter is not P.

 Combining previous feedback:
   Absent letters: C, N, D, P

 The secret word pattern is: G R A _ E

 We still need to find the fourth letter. It cannot be C, N, D, or P.

 Possible words: 
   grave (with V at 4)
   grate (with T at 4)
   graze (with Z at 4)

 We can also consider less common words, but these are the main ones.

 Now, we have to choose one of the candidates.

 To maximize information, we could choose a word that tests multiple possible letters at once? But since we have only one position to fill, and we are forced to put one letter there, we can't test multiple in one guess.

 We have 3 possible letters: V, T, Z.

 We can try one of them.

 We have 3 tries left (this is the fourth guess, so we have 3 remaining after this: 4,5,6).

 Let's try ""grave"" to test V.

 If V is correct, we win. If not, we know V is absent and we can try ""grate"" next.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use V, T, Z in the fourth position but uses one of them and introduces none? But that doesn't help.

 Another idea: we can use a word that has the known pattern with one candidate and also includes other new letters? But we can't because the pattern must be ""G R A ? E"", and the fourth letter is the only unknown. We cannot change the other letters.

 Therefore, we must choose a candidate.

 I'll go with ""grave"" because V is a common letter? Or perhaps T is more common.

 In English, T is more common than V or Z.

 So, maybe we try ""grate"" first.

 Let me decide: 
   Option: ""grave"", ""grate"", ""graze""

 Without knowing frequencies, I think ""grate"" is the most common word.

 However, note that ""graze"" has Z which is less common.

Based on the feedback from ""grape"":
- **P (position 4) is absent (x)**, so P is not in the secret word.

- Prioritize testing **T** (a high-frequency consonant) in position 4 to cover the most plausible candidate, ""grate"".  
- If ""grate"" is correct, the puzzle is solved.  
- If T is absent, we eliminate it and focus on V or Z in subsequent guesses.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (position 2)
 A: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (position 3? Actually, in ""crane"", A is at position 3, but note: positions are 1-indexed? Let's note the positions: 
   c (1), r (2), a (3), n (4), e (5)
 So, R is at position 2 and is correct, meaning the secret word has R at position 2.
 A is at position 3 and is correct, meaning the secret word has A at position 3.
 E is at position 5 and is correct, meaning the secret word has E at position 5.
 C and N are not in the word.

 Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R A _ E

 We know the letters C and N are not in the word.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We want to try to find the missing letters (first and fourth) and also confirm any other letters.

 Since we have three fixed letters (R at 2, A at 3, E at 5) and we know two letters that are not present (C and N), we can choose a word that:
   - Has the fixed letters in the same positions: positions 2, 3, and 5 must be R, A, E respectively.
   - The first and fourth positions should be new letters that we haven't tried (avoid C and N) and that are common.

 We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let's think of words that fit the pattern: [letter1] R A [letter4] E

 We know letter1 and letter4 cannot be C or N.

 Some possibilities: 
   grape -> G at 1, P at 4
   drape -> D at 1, P at 4
   trace -> but T at 1, C at 4 -> but C is already known to be absent, so not valid.
   brave -> B at 1, V at 4 -> but we haven't tried B or V.

 However, note that in the first guess we only know that C and N are absent. We don't know about other letters.

 We can also consider that we might have repeated letters? But the feedback didn't show any, and we don't have evidence of duplicates yet.

 Let's list some words that fit the pattern: _ R A _ E

 5-letter words ending with E, with R at position 2 and A at position 3:
   brace -> but B at 1, C at 4 -> C is absent, so invalid.
   brake -> B at 1, K at 4
   brave -> B at 1, V at 4
   drake -> D at 1, K at 4
   drape -> D at 1, P at 4
   frame -> F at 1, M at 4
   grace -> G at 1, C at 4 -> C absent, invalid.
   grade -> G at 1, D at 4
   grape -> G at 1, P at 4
   grave -> G at 1, V at 4
   trace -> T at 1, C at 4 -> C absent, invalid.
   trade -> T at 1, D at 4

 We can choose any of the valid ones. We want to test new letters to get more information.

 Since we have two missing letters, we might want to choose a word that uses common consonants and that we haven't tried.

 We have not tried: B, D, F, G, K, M, P, T, V, etc.

 We can choose ""brake"" to test B and K. Or ""drape"" to test D and P.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters that are more common.

 Let's pick ""brake"": 
   B is a common starting letter, and K is a common ending consonant.

 But note: we are also testing the letter B at position 1 and K at position 4.

 However, we must be cautious: if the word is ""brave"", then we would get B correct and K wrong, but we wouldn't know about V.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters that are more likely to appear in many words? 

 Another idea: we can choose a word that doesn't use the same letter twice and uses letters we haven't tried.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can afford to test multiple letters.

 Let's choose ""drape"" because D and P are common.

 But note: we are also testing the pattern. If we get feedback that D is in the word and in the correct position, then we know the first letter is D. Similarly for P.

 However, we don't know if the first letter is D or not. So by using ""drape"", we are testing two new letters at once.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has many new letters and doesn't repeat.

 Let me choose ""brake"" for the second guess.

 But wait, we have to consider that the first letter might be a vowel? Actually, we already have two vowels (A and E) and one consonant (R). The first letter is likely a consonant.

 After thinking, I decide to go with ""brake"".

 So, second guess: ""brake""

 However, let me check: 
   b r a k e
   positions: 1: B, 2: R (fixed), 3: A (fixed), 4: K, 5: E (fixed)

 We are testing B and K.

 But note: we are also testing the entire pattern. If the word is ""brake"", we win. Otherwise, we get feedback on B and K.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more common letters? 

 Another candidate: ""trade"" -> T at 1, D at 4. We haven't tried T or D.

 But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C and N are absent, so T and D are safe.

 However, ""trade"" has the advantage that D is a common letter.

 But let's look at the frequency: 
   In English, the most common consonants are T, R, S, ... but we already have R.

 We can also consider ""grade"": G at 1, D at 4.

 I think ""grade"" is a good choice because G and D are common.

 However, we are trying to maximize information. We can also consider that we have only one chance to test two new letters.

 I'll go with ""grade"" because it uses G and D, which are both common.

 So, second guess: ""grade""

 But wait, we have to make sure that we are not using any excluded letters. We know C and N are excluded. G and D are not excluded.

 Therefore, let's guess ""grade"".

<guess>grade</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C (position 1) is absent (x), so the secret word does not contain C.
- R (position 2) is correct (✓), so the secret word has R in position 2.
- A (position 3) is correct (✓), so the secret word has A in position 3.
- N (position 4) is absent (x), so the secret word does not contain N.
- E (position 5) is correct (✓), so the secret word has E in position 5.

The secret word pattern is: _ R A _ E  
Absent letters: C, N  

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Maintain R, A, E in positions 2, 3, and 5.
2. Test new letters in positions 1 and 4 (avoiding C and N).
3. Prioritize common letters to maximize information.

I chose ""grade"" because:
- It fits the pattern (_ R A _ E) with G in position 1 and D in position 4.
- G and D are common consonants not yet tested.
- This tests two new letters simultaneously, helping identify the missing characters efficiently.

<guess>grade</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: grade -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) R(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the second guess ""grade"":
 G: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (position 1)
 R: ✓ -> already known to be correct at position 2
 A: ✓ -> already known to be correct at position 3
 D: x -> not in the word
 E: ✓ -> already known to be correct at position 5

 So, from the feedback of ""grade"":
 - G is correct at position 1. Therefore, the secret word starts with G.
 - D is not in the word.

 Now, combining with previous feedback:
   Secret word pattern: G R A _ E   (positions: 1=G, 2=R, 3=A, 5=E)
   Absent letters: C, N, D

 We now know the first letter is G, so the word is ""G R A _ E"".

 We need to find the fourth letter. It cannot be C, N, or D.

 We must choose a word that fits the known pattern and tests the fourth position.

 However, note that we have only one missing letter (the fourth) and we know the rest.

 But wait: we must also consider that there might be duplicate letters? However, we have no indication of duplicates so far.

 Since we know four letters and only one is missing, we can try to guess the word by testing possible letters for the fourth position.

 What are possible letters for the fourth position? We need to form a valid English word.

 Possible words: 
   grace -> but C is absent, so invalid.
   grape -> P is a possibility (and we haven't tested P)
   grave -> V is a possibility
   grate -> T is a possibility (but note: we haven't tested T, but T is common)
   gaze -> only 4 letters, not 5.
   grame -> not a common word? (but let's check: it might be a variant, but we should stick to common words)
   grape, grave, grate, grase (not a word), graze -> Z is a possibility.

 Common words: 
   grape, grave, grate, graze, etc.

 We know D is absent, so ""grade"" is out.

 We can make a guess that uses one of these and also tests the fourth letter.

 However, we have 4 known letters and only one unknown. We can try to guess one of the possibilities.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test multiple possibilities? Actually, we can try to guess the word directly.

 However, we might not get it on the first try of the possibilities, and we have 4 tries left.

 Alternatively, we can make a guess that uses the known pattern and introduces new letters to test? But we only have one missing letter.

 But wait: what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, if the word is ""grace"", but C is absent so that's not possible. Or ""grape"" has no duplicates.

 Since we have no evidence of duplicates, we can assume the fourth letter is a new letter.

 We can try to guess ""grape"" to test P. If it's correct, we win. If not, we know P is absent and we can try another.

 But we can also try to use a word that has the known pattern and also tests other letters that might be in the word? However, the word is almost complete.

 Let me list the possible common words that fit ""G R A _ E"":
   grape (P)
   grave (V)
   grate (T)
   graze (Z)
   grace (C) -> but C is absent, so invalid.
   grade (D) -> but D is absent, so invalid.
   graze is a word.

 Other less common: grame (not common), grafe (not a word), etc.

 We have four possibilities: P, V, T, Z.

 We can try to guess one of them. But if we guess wrong, we get information about that letter.

 Alternatively, we can make a guess that uses the pattern and also includes other letters that we haven't tested? But we don't have any other missing positions.

 However, note: we have to fill the fourth position. We cannot leave it blank.

 We can try to use a word that has the known letters (G, R, A, E) in the correct positions and a new letter in the fourth, and also includes other new letters? But that's not possible because the word must be 5 letters and we have fixed positions 1,2,3,5.

 The fourth position is the only one we can change.

 Therefore, we must choose a word that is ""G R A ? E"", and the ? is a letter we haven't tried and that is not absent.

 We have not tried: B, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know C, N, D are absent).

 But we are limited to words that exist.

 So, we can try:

 Option 1: Guess ""grape"" to test P. If P is correct, we win. If not, then P is absent and we try another.

 Option 2: Similarly, we can try ""grave"" for V.

 But we have 4 tries left, so we can try one.

 However, we can also consider: what if we use a word that doesn't have the pattern but tests multiple possible letters at once? 

 For example, we could use a word that has P, V, T, Z in it? But we don't have a position for them? 

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has the known letters in the correct positions and then the fourth letter is one of the candidates? That's what we are doing.

 But note: we cannot test multiple candidates at once because the fourth position can only be one letter.

 So, we have to test one by one.

 However, we can also use a word that has the known pattern and also includes a letter that is not in the word? That wouldn't help.

 Therefore, I think the best is to try one of the candidates.

 Let's choose the most common word: ""grape"" is common.

 But note: we have to consider the frequency of letters. P is a common letter.

 Alternatively, we can look at the list of possible words and see which one is more likely.

 Without frequency data, we can choose arbitrarily.

 I'll choose ""grape"" for the third guess.

 So, guess: ""grape""

 But wait, what if the word is ""grave""? Then we get feedback that P is absent and we know to try V next.

 Similarly, if we get all correct, we win.

 So, let's do that.

<guess>grape</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the second guess ""grade"":
- G (position 1) is correct (✓), confirming the secret word starts with G.
- R (position 2) and A (position 3) remain correct (✓), consistent with the first guess.
- D (position 4) is absent (x), so D is not in the secret word.
- E (position 5) remains correct (✓).

### Updated Information:
- **Secret word pattern**: G R A _ E  
  (positions: 1=G, 2=R, 3=A, 5=E; position 4 is unknown).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, D (cannot appear anywhere).
- **Known present letters**: G, R, A, E (all fixed in positions except G is now confirmed at position 1).

### Strategy for the Third Guess:
- The secret word is **G R A _ E**, with only the fourth letter missing.
- Possible letters for position 4 must form valid English words (e.g., P for ""grape"", V for ""grave"", T for ""grate"", Z for ""graze"").
- Since C, N, and D are absent, options like ""grace"" or ""grade"" are invalid.
- Goal: Test the most common candidate for position 4 while maximizing efficiency. ""Grape"" is a high-frequency word and tests P, a common consonant not yet evaluated.

### Why ""grape""?
- Tests P in position 4.
- If correct, the puzzle is solved.
- If P is absent, we eliminate it and proceed with other candidates (e.g., V, T, Z) in future guesses.

 So, from this we know that the secret word is ""G R A _ E"", and the fourth letter is not P.

 Combining previous feedback:
   Absent letters: C, N, D, P

 The secret word pattern is: G R A _ E

 We still need to find the fourth letter. It cannot be C, N, D, or P.

 Possible words: 
   grave (with V at 4)
   grate (with T at 4)
   graze (with Z at 4)

 We can also consider less common words, but these are the main ones.

 Now, we have to choose one of the candidates.

 To maximize information, we could choose a word that tests multiple possible letters at once? But since we have only one position to fill, and we are forced to put one letter there, we can't test multiple in one guess.

 We have 3 possible letters: V, T, Z.

 We can try one of them.

 We have 3 tries left (this is the fourth guess, so we have 3 remaining after this: 4,5,6).

 Let's try ""grave"" to test V.

 If V is correct, we win. If not, we know V is absent and we can try ""grate"" next.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use V, T, Z in the fourth position but uses one of them and introduces none? But that doesn't help.

 Another idea: we can use a word that has the known pattern with one candidate and also includes other new letters? But we can't because the pattern must be ""G R A ? E"", and the fourth letter is the only unknown. We cannot change the other letters.

 Therefore, we must choose a candidate.

 I'll go with ""grave"" because V is a common letter? Or perhaps T is more common.

 In English, T is more common than V or Z.

 So, maybe we try ""grate"" first.

 Let me decide: 
   Option: ""grave"", ""grate"", ""graze""

 Without knowing frequencies, I think ""grate"" is the most common word.

 However, note that ""graze"" has Z which is less common.

 I'll choose ""grate"" for the fourth guess.

 Guess: ""grate""

<guess>grate</guess>Based on the feedback from ""grape"":
- **P (position 4) is absent (x)**, so P is not in the secret word.  
This eliminates ""grape"" as a solution.

- Prioritize testing **T** (a high-frequency consonant) in position 4 to cover the most plausible candidate, ""grate"".  
- If ""grate"" is correct, the puzzle is solved.  
- If T is absent, we eliminate it and focus on V or Z in subsequent guesses.

We don\'t know about other letters.\n\n We can also consider that we might have repeated letters? But the feedback didn\'t show any, and we don\'t have evidence of duplicates yet.\n\n Let\'s list some words that fit the pattern: _ R A _ E\n\n 5-letter words ending with E, with R at position 2 and A at position 3:\n   brace -> but B at 1, C at 4 -> C is absent, so invalid.\n   brake -> B at 1, K at 4\n   brave -> B at 1, V at 4\n   drake -> D at 1, K at 4\n   drape -> D at 1, P at 4\n   frame -> F at 1, M at 4\n   grace -> G at 1, C at 4 -> C absent, invalid.\n   grade -> G at 1, D at 4\n   grape -> G at 1, P at 4\n   grave -> G at 1, V at 4\n   trace -> T at 1, C at 4 -> C absent, invalid.\n   trade -> T at 1, D at 4\n\n We can choose any of the valid ones.

Or ""drape"" to test D and P.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters that are more common.\n\n Let\'s pick ""brake"": \n   B is a common starting letter, and K is a common ending consonant.\n\n But note: we are also testing the letter B at position 1 and K at position 4.\n\n However, we must be cautious: if the word is ""brave"", then we would get B correct and K wrong, but we wouldn\'t know about V.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters that are more likely to appear in many words? \n\n Another idea: we can choose a word that doesn\'t use the same letter twice and uses letters we haven\'t tried.\n\n Since we have 6 tries, we can afford to test multiple letters.\n\n Let\'s choose ""drape"" because D and P are common.\n\n But note: we are also testing the pattern. If we get feedback that D is in the word and in the correct position, then we know the first letter is D. Similarly for P.\n\n However, we don\'t know if the first letter is D or not. So by using ""drape"", we are testing two new letters at once.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has many new letters and doesn\'t repeat.\n\n Let me choose ""brake"" for the second guess.\n\n But wait, we have to consider that the first letter might be a vowel? Actually, we already have two vowels (A and E) and one consonant (R). The first letter is likely a consonant.\n\n After thinking, I decide to go with ""brake"".\n\n So, second guess: ""brake""\n\n However, let me check: \n   b r a k e\n   positions: 1: B, 2: R (fixed), 3: A (fixed), 4: K, 5: E (fixed)\n\n We are testing B and K.\n\n But note: we are also testing the entire pattern.

We haven\'t tried T or D.\n\n But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C and N are absent, so T and D are safe.\n\n However, ""trade"" has the advantage that D is a common letter.\n\n But let\'s look at the frequency: \n   In English, the most common consonants are T, R, S, ... but we already have R.\n\n We can also consider ""grade"": G at 1, D at 4.\n\n I think ""grade"" is a good choice because G and D are common.\n\n However, we are trying to maximize information. We can also consider that we have only one chance to test two new letters.\n\n I\'ll go with ""grade"" because it uses G and D, which are both common.\n\n So, second guess: ""grade""\n\n But wait, we have to make sure that we are not using any excluded letters. We know C and N are excluded. G and D are not excluded.\n\n Therefore, let\'s guess ""grade"".\n\n<guess>grade</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C (position 1) is absent (x), so the secret word does not contain C.\n- R (position 2) is correct (✓), so the secret word has R in position 2.\n- A (position 3) is correct (✓), so the secret word has A in position 3.\n- N (position 4) is absent (x), so the secret word does not contain N.\n- E (position 5) is correct (✓), so the secret word has E in position 5.\n\nThe secret word pattern is: _ R A _ E  \nAbsent letters: C, N  \n\nFor the second guess, I need to:\n1. Maintain R, A, E in positions 2, 3, and 5.\n2. Test new letters in positions 1 and 4 (avoiding C and N).\n3. Prioritize common letters to maximize information.\n\nI chose ""grade"" because:\n- It fits the pattern (_ R A _ E) with G in position 1 and D in position 4.\n- G and D are common consonants not yet tested.\n- This tests two new letters simultaneously, helping identify the missing characters efficiently.\n\n<guess>grade</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: grade -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) R(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the second guess ""grade"":\n G: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (position 1)\n R: ✓ -> already known to be correct at position 2\n A: ✓ -> already known to be correct at position 3\n D: x -> not in the word\n E: ✓ -> already known to be correct at position 5\n\n So, from the feedback of ""grade"":\n - G is correct at position 1. Therefore, the secret word starts with G.\n - D is not in the word.\n\n Now, combining with previous feedback:\n   Secret word pattern: G R A _ E   (positions: 1=G, 2=R, 3=A, 5=E)\n   Absent letters: C, N, D\n\n We now know the first letter is G, so the word is ""G R A _ E"".\n\n We need to find the fourth letter.

However, we have no indication of duplicates so far.\n\n Since we know four letters and only one is missing, we can try to guess the word by testing possible letters for the fourth position.\n\n What are possible letters for the fourth position? We need to form a valid English word.\n\n Possible words: \n   grace -> but C is absent, so invalid.\n   grape -> P is a possibility (and we haven\'t tested P)\n   grave -> V is a possibility\n   grate -> T is a possibility (but note: we haven\'t tested T, but T is common)\n   gaze -> only 4 letters, not 5.\n   grame -> not a common word?

We can try to guess one of the possibilities.\n\n But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test multiple possibilities? Actually, we can try to guess the word directly.\n\n However, we might not get it on the first try of the possibilities, and we have 4 tries left.\n\n Alternatively, we can make a guess that uses the known pattern and introduces new letters to test? But we only have one missing letter.\n\n But wait: what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, if the word is ""grace"", but C is absent so that\'s not possible. Or ""grape"" has no duplicates.\n\n Since we have no evidence of duplicates, we can assume the fourth letter is a new letter.\n\n We can try to guess ""grape"" to test P. If it\'s correct, we win. If not, we know P is absent and we can try another.\n\n But we can also try to use a word that has the known pattern and also tests other letters that might be in the word? However, the word is almost complete.\n\n Let me list the possible common words that fit ""G R A _ E"":\n   grape (P)\n   grave (V)\n   grate (T)\n   graze (Z)\n   grace (C) -> but C is absent, so invalid.\n   grade (D) -> but D is absent, so invalid.\n   graze is a word.\n\n Other less common: grame (not common), grafe (not a word), etc.\n\n We have four possibilities: P, V, T, Z.\n\n We can try to guess one of them. But if we guess wrong, we get information about that letter.\n\n Alternatively, we can make a guess that uses the pattern and also includes other letters that we haven\'t tested? But we don\'t have any other missing positions.\n\n However, note: we have to fill the fourth position. We cannot leave it blank.\n\n We can try to use a word that has the known letters (G, R, A, E) in the correct positions and a new letter in the fourth, and also includes other new letters? But that\'s not possible because the word must be 5 letters and we have fixed positions 1,2,3,5.\n\n The fourth position is the only one we can change.\n\n Therefore, we must choose a word that is ""G R A ? E"", and the ? is a letter we haven\'t tried and that is not absent.\n\n We have not tried: B, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know C, N, D are absent).\n\n But we are limited to words that exist.\n\n So, we can try:\n\n Option 1: Guess ""grape"" to test P. If P is correct, we win. If not, then P is absent and we try another.\n\n Option 2: Similarly, we can try ""grave"" for V.\n\n But we have 4 tries left, so we can try one.\n\n However, we can also consider: what if we use a word that doesn\'t have the pattern but tests multiple possible letters at once? \n\n For example, we could use a word that has P, V, T, Z in it? But we don\'t have a position for them? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a word that has the known letters in the correct positions and then the fourth letter is one of the candidates? That\'s what we are doing.\n\n But note: we cannot test multiple candidates at once because the fourth position can only be one letter.\n\n So, we have to test one by one.\n\n However, we can also use a word that has the known pattern and also includes a letter that is not in the word? That wouldn\'t help.\n\n Therefore, I think the best is to try one of the candidates.\n\n Let\'s choose the most common word: ""grape"" is common.\n\n But note: we have to consider the frequency of letters. P is a common letter.\n\n Alternatively, we can look at the list of possible words and see which one is more likely.\n\n Without frequency data, we can choose arbitrarily.\n\n I\'ll choose ""grape"" for the third guess.\n\n So, guess: ""grape""\n\n But wait, what if the word is ""grave""?

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

 C and N are not in the word.

 We know the letters C and N are not in the word.

 Since we have three fixed letters (R at 2, A at 3, E at 5) and we know two letters that are not present (C and N), we can choose a word that:
   - Has the fixed letters in the same positions: positions 2, 3, and 5 must be R, A, E respectively.
   - The first and fourth positions should be new letters that we haven't tried (avoid C and N) and that are common.

 We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let's think of words that fit the pattern: [letter1] R A [letter4] E

 We know letter1 and letter4 cannot be C or N.

 Some possibilities: 
   grape -> G at 1, P at 4
   drape -> D at 1, P at 4
   trace -> but T at 1, C at 4 -> but C is already known to be absent, so not valid.
   brave -> B at 1, V at 4 -> but we haven't tried B or V.

 However, note that in the first guess we only know that C and N are absent. We don't know about other letters.

 We can also consider that we might have repeated letters? But the feedback didn't show any, and we don't have evidence of duplicates yet.

 Let's list some words that fit the pattern: _ R A _ E

 5-letter words ending with E, with R at position 2 and A at position 3:
   brace -> but B at 1, C at 4 -> C is absent, so invalid.
   brake -> B at 1, K at 4
   brave -> B at 1, V at 4
   drake -> D at 1, K at 4
   drape -> D at 1, P at 4
   frame -> F at 1, M at 4
   grace -> G at 1, C at 4 -> C absent, invalid.
   grade -> G at 1, D at 4
   grape -> G at 1, P at 4
   grave -> G at 1, V at 4
   trace -> T at 1, C at 4 -> C absent, invalid.
   trade -> T at 1, D at 4

 We can choose any of the valid ones. We want to test new letters to get more information.

 Since we have two missing letters, we might want to choose a word that uses common consonants and that we haven't tried.

 We have not tried: B, D, F, G, K, M, P, T, V, etc.

 We can choose ""brake"" to test B and K. Or ""drape"" to test D and P.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters that are more common.

 Let's pick ""brake"": 
   B is a common starting letter, and K is a common ending consonant.

 But note: we are also testing the letter B at position 1 and K at position 4.

 However, we must be cautious: if the word is ""brave"", then we would get B correct and K wrong, but we wouldn't know about V.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters that are more likely to appear in many words? 

 Another idea: we can choose a word that doesn't use the same letter twice and uses letters we haven't tried.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can afford to test multiple letters.

 Let's choose ""drape"" because D and P are common.

 But note: we are also testing the pattern. If we get feedback that D is in the word and in the correct position, then we know the first letter is D. Similarly for P.

 However, we don't know if the first letter is D or not. So by using ""drape"", we are testing two new letters at once.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has many new letters and doesn't repeat.

 Let me choose ""brake"" for the second guess.

 But wait, we have to consider that the first letter might be a vowel? Actually, we already have two vowels (A and E) and one consonant (R). The first letter is likely a consonant.

 After thinking, I decide to go with ""brake"".

 So, second guess: ""brake""

 However, let me check: 
   b r a k e
   positions: 1: B, 2: R (fixed), 3: A (fixed), 4: K, 5: E (fixed)

 We are testing B and K.

 But note: we are also testing the entire pattern. If the word is ""brake"", we win. Otherwise, we get feedback on B and K.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more common letters? 

 Another candidate: ""trade"" -> T at 1, D at 4. We haven't tried T or D.

 But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C and N are absent, so T and D are safe.

 However, ""trade"" has the advantage that D is a common letter.

 But let's look at the frequency: 
   In English, the most common consonants are T, R, S, ... but we already have R.

 We can also consider ""grade"": G at 1, D at 4.

 I think ""grade"" is a good choice because G and D are common.

 However, we are trying to maximize information. We can also consider that we have only one chance to test two new letters.

 I'll go with ""grade"" because it uses G and D, which are both common.

 So, second guess: ""grade""

 But wait, we have to make sure that we are not using any excluded letters. We know C and N are excluded. G and D are not excluded.

 Therefore, let's guess ""grade"".

<guess>grade</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C (position 1) is absent (x), so the secret word does not contain C.
- R (position 2) is correct (✓), so the secret word has R in position 2.
- A (position 3) is correct (✓), so the secret word has A in position 3.
- N (position 4) is absent (x), so the secret word does not contain N.
- E (position 5) is correct (✓), so the secret word has E in position 5.

The secret word pattern is: _ R A _ E  
Absent letters: C, N  

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Maintain R, A, E in positions 2, 3, and 5.
2. Test new letters in positions 1 and 4 (avoiding C and N).
3. Prioritize common letters to maximize information.

I chose ""grade"" because:
- It fits the pattern (_ R A _ E) with G in position 1 and D in position 4.
- G and D are common consonants not yet tested.
- This tests two new letters simultaneously, helping identify the missing characters efficiently.

<guess>grade</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: grade -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) R(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the second guess ""grade"":
 G: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (position 1)
 R: ✓ -> already known to be correct at position 2
 A: ✓ -> already known to be correct at position 3
 D: x -> not in the word
 E: ✓ -> already known to be correct at position 5

 So, from the feedback of ""grade"":
 - G is correct at position 1. Therefore, the secret word starts with G.
 - D is not in the word.

 Now, combining with previous feedback:
   Secret word pattern: G R A _ E   (positions: 1=G, 2=R, 3=A, 5=E)
   Absent letters: C, N, D

 We now know the first letter is G, so the word is ""G R A _ E"".

 We need to find the fourth letter. It cannot be C, N, or D.

 We must choose a word that fits the known pattern and tests the fourth position.

 However, note that we have only one missing letter (the fourth) and we know the rest.

 But wait: we must also consider that there might be duplicate letters? However, we have no indication of duplicates so far.

 Since we know four letters and only one is missing, we can try to guess the word by testing possible letters for the fourth position.

 What are possible letters for the fourth position? We need to form a valid English word.

 Possible words: 
   grace -> but C is absent, so invalid.
   grape -> P is a possibility (and we haven't tested P)
   grave -> V is a possibility
   grate -> T is a possibility (but note: we haven't tested T, but T is common)
   gaze -> only 4 letters, not 5.
   grame -> not a common word? (but let's check: it might be a variant, but we should stick to common words)
   grape, grave, grate, grase (not a word), graze -> Z is a possibility.

 Common words: 
   grape, grave, grate, graze, etc.

 We know D is absent, so ""grade"" is out.

 We can make a guess that uses one of these and also tests the fourth letter.

 However, we have 4 known letters and only one unknown. We can try to guess one of the possibilities.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test multiple possibilities? Actually, we can try to guess the word directly.

 However, we might not get it on the first try of the possibilities, and we have 4 tries left.

 Alternatively, we can make a guess that uses the known pattern and introduces new letters to test? But we only have one missing letter.

 But wait: what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, if the word is ""grace"", but C is absent so that's not possible. Or ""grape"" has no duplicates.

 Since we have no evidence of duplicates, we can assume the fourth letter is a new letter.

 We can try to guess ""grape"" to test P. If it's correct, we win. If not, we know P is absent and we can try another.

 But we can also try to use a word that has the known pattern and also tests other letters that might be in the word? However, the word is almost complete.

 Let me list the possible common words that fit ""G R A _ E"":
   grape (P)
   grave (V)
   grate (T)
   graze (Z)
   grace (C) -> but C is absent, so invalid.
   grade (D) -> but D is absent, so invalid.
   graze is a word.

 Other less common: grame (not common), grafe (not a word), etc.

 We have four possibilities: P, V, T, Z.

 We can try to guess one of them. But if we guess wrong, we get information about that letter.

 Alternatively, we can make a guess that uses the pattern and also includes other letters that we haven't tested? But we don't have any other missing positions.

 However, note: we have to fill the fourth position. We cannot leave it blank.

 We can try to use a word that has the known letters (G, R, A, E) in the correct positions and a new letter in the fourth, and also includes other new letters? But that's not possible because the word must be 5 letters and we have fixed positions 1,2,3,5.

 The fourth position is the only one we can change.

 Therefore, we must choose a word that is ""G R A ? E"", and the ? is a letter we haven't tried and that is not absent.

 We have not tried: B, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know C, N, D are absent).

 But we are limited to words that exist.

 So, we can try:

 Option 1: Guess ""grape"" to test P. If P is correct, we win. If not, then P is absent and we try another.

 Option 2: Similarly, we can try ""grave"" for V.

 But we have 4 tries left, so we can try one.

 However, we can also consider: what if we use a word that doesn't have the pattern but tests multiple possible letters at once? 

 For example, we could use a word that has P, V, T, Z in it? But we don't have a position for them? 

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has the known letters in the correct positions and then the fourth letter is one of the candidates? That's what we are doing.

 But note: we cannot test multiple candidates at once because the fourth position can only be one letter.

 So, we have to test one by one.

 However, we can also use a word that has the known pattern and also includes a letter that is not in the word? That wouldn't help.

 Therefore, I think the best is to try one of the candidates.

 Let's choose the most common word: ""grape"" is common.

 But note: we have to consider the frequency of letters. P is a common letter.

 Alternatively, we can look at the list of possible words and see which one is more likely.

 Without frequency data, we can choose arbitrarily.

 I'll choose ""grape"" for the third guess.

 So, guess: ""grape""

 But wait, what if the word is ""grave""? Then we get feedback that P is absent and we know to try V next.

 Similarly, if we get all correct, we win.

 So, let's do that.

<guess>grape</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the second guess ""grade"":
- G (position 1) is correct (✓), confirming the secret word starts with G.
- R (position 2) and A (position 3) remain correct (✓), consistent with the first guess.
- D (position 4) is absent (x), so D is not in the secret word.
- E (position 5) remains correct (✓).

### Updated Information:
- **Secret word pattern**: G R A _ E  
  (positions: 1=G, 2=R, 3=A, 5=E; position 4 is unknown).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, D (cannot appear anywhere).
- **Known present letters**: G, R, A, E (all fixed in positions except G is now confirmed at position 1).

### Strategy for the Third Guess:
- The secret word is **G R A _ E**, with only the fourth letter missing.
- Possible letters for position 4 must form valid English words (e.g., P for ""grape"", V for ""grave"", T for ""grate"", Z for ""graze"").
- Since C, N, and D are absent, options like ""grace"" or ""grade"" are invalid.
- Goal: Test the most common candidate for position 4 while maximizing efficiency. ""Grape"" is a high-frequency word and tests P, a common consonant not yet evaluated.

### Why ""grape""?
- Tests P in position 4.
- If correct, the puzzle is solved.
- If P is absent, we eliminate it and proceed with other candidates (e.g., V, T, Z) in future guesses.

<guess>grape</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: grade -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) R(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: grape -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) R(✓) A(✓) P(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the third guess ""grape"":
 G: ✓ -> correct at position 1 (already known)
 R: ✓ -> correct at position 2 (already known)
 A: ✓ -> correct at position 3 (already known)
 P: x -> not in the word
 E: ✓ -> correct at position 5 (already known)

 So, from this we know that the secret word is ""G R A _ E"", and the fourth letter is not P.

 Combining previous feedback:
   Absent letters: C, N, D, P

 The secret word pattern is: G R A _ E

 We still need to find the fourth letter. It cannot be C, N, D, or P.

 Possible words: 
   grave (with V at 4)
   grate (with T at 4)
   graze (with Z at 4)

 We can also consider less common words, but these are the main ones.

 Now, we have to choose one of the candidates.

 To maximize information, we could choose a word that tests multiple possible letters at once? But since we have only one position to fill, and we are forced to put one letter there, we can't test multiple in one guess.

 We have 3 possible letters: V, T, Z.

 We can try one of them.

 We have 3 tries left (this is the fourth guess, so we have 3 remaining after this: 4,5,6).

 Let's try ""grave"" to test V.

 If V is correct, we win. If not, we know V is absent and we can try ""grate"" next.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use V, T, Z in the fourth position but uses one of them and introduces none? But that doesn't help.

 Another idea: we can use a word that has the known pattern with one candidate and also includes other new letters? But we can't because the pattern must be ""G R A ? E"", and the fourth letter is the only unknown. We cannot change the other letters.

 Therefore, we must choose a candidate.

 I'll go with ""grave"" because V is a common letter? Or perhaps T is more common.

 In English, T is more common than V or Z.

 So, maybe we try ""grate"" first.

 Let me decide: 
   Option: ""grave"", ""grate"", ""graze""

 Without knowing frequencies, I think ""grate"" is the most common word.

 However, note that ""graze"" has Z which is less common.

 I'll choose ""grate"" for the fourth guess.

 Guess: ""grate""

<guess>grate</guess>Based on the feedback from ""grape"":
- **P (position 4) is absent (x)**, so P is not in the secret word.  
This eliminates ""grape"" as a solution.

### Updated Information:
- **Secret word pattern**: **G R A _ E**  
  (positions: 1=G (✓), 2=R (✓), 3=A (✓), 4=?, 5=E (✓)).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, D, P (cannot appear anywhere).
- **Present letters**: G, R, A, E (all fixed in positions).
- **Remaining candidates** for position 4:  
  Words fitting the pattern and excluding absent letters are:  
  - **grave** (V at position 4)  
  - **grate** (T at position 4)  
  - **graze** (Z at position 4)  

### Strategy for the Fourth Guess:
- Prioritize testing **T** (a high-frequency consonant) in position 4 to cover the most plausible candidate, ""grate"".  
- If ""grate"" is correct, the puzzle is solved.  
- If T is absent, we eliminate it and focus on V or Z in subsequent guesses.

 So, T is absent. Therefore, the secret word is not ""grate"", and T is not in the word at all.

 Now, we have:
   Secret word pattern: G R A _ E
   Absent letters: C, N, D, P, T

 The remaining possibilities for the fourth letter are V (for ""grave"") and Z (for ""graze"").

 We have two options left. We can try one of them.

 Since we have two guesses left (this is the fifth guess, and we have one more after if needed), we can try ""grave"".

 If we guess ""grave"" and it's correct, we win. If not, then the word must be ""graze"".

 Alternatively, we could try ""graze"" first.

 But note: we don't have any information about V or Z. We have to choose one.

 Let's choose ""grave"" for the fifth guess.

 If it's not ""grave"", then we know it must be ""graze"".

 So, fifth guess: ""grave""

<guess>grave</guess>The feedback for ""grate"" shows that **T is absent (x)**, eliminating ""grate"" as a solution.  

### Updated Information:  
- **Secret word pattern**: **G R A _ E**

- **Absent letters**: C, N, D, P, T.  
- **Remaining candidates** for position 4:

  - **Z** (for ""graze"").  

### Strategy for the Fifth Guess:  
- Only two candidates remain: ""grave"" and ""graze"".  
- Guess **""grave""** to test **V** in position 4:  
  - If correct, the puzzle is solved.  
  - If V is absent, the solution must be ""graze"" (Z in position 4).

G and D are not excluded.\n\n Therefore, let\'s guess ""grade"".\n\n<guess>grade</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C (position 1) is absent (x), so the secret word does not contain C.\n- R (position 2) is correct (✓), so the secret word has R in position 2.\n- A (position 3) is correct (✓), so the secret word has A in position 3.\n- N (position 4) is absent (x), so the secret word does not contain N.\n- E (position 5) is correct (✓), so the secret word has E in position 5.\n\nThe secret word pattern is: _ R A _ E  \nAbsent letters: C, N  \n\nFor the second guess, I need to:\n1. Maintain R, A, E in positions 2, 3, and 5.\n2. Test new letters in positions 1 and 4 (avoiding C and N).\n3. Prioritize common letters to maximize information.\n\nI chose ""grade"" because:\n- It fits the pattern (_ R A _ E) with G in position 1 and D in position 4.\n- G and D are common consonants not yet tested.\n- This tests two new letters simultaneously, helping identify the missing characters efficiently.\n\n<guess>grade</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: grade -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) R(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the second guess ""grade"":\n G: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (position 1)\n R: ✓ -> already known to be correct at position 2\n A: ✓ -> already known to be correct at position 3\n D: x -> not in the word\n E: ✓ -> already known to be correct at position 5\n\n So, from the feedback of ""grade"":\n - G is correct at position 1. Therefore, the secret word starts with G.\n - D is not in the word.\n\n Now, combining with previous feedback:\n   Secret word pattern: G R A _ E   (positions: 1=G, 2=R, 3=A, 5=E)\n   Absent letters: C, N, D\n\n We now know the first letter is G, so the word is ""G R A _ E"".\n\n We need to find the fourth letter. It cannot be C, N, or D.\n\n We must choose a word that fits the known pattern and tests the fourth position.\n\n However, note that we have only one missing letter (the fourth) and we know the rest.\n\n But wait: we must also consider that there might be duplicate letters? However, we have no indication of duplicates so far.\n\n Since we know four letters and only one is missing, we can try to guess the word by testing possible letters for the fourth position.\n\n What are possible letters for the fourth position? We need to form a valid English word.\n\n Possible words: \n   grace -> but C is absent, so invalid.\n   grape -> P is a possibility (and we haven\'t tested P)\n   grave -> V is a possibility\n   grate -> T is a possibility (but note: we haven\'t tested T, but T is common)\n   gaze -> only 4 letters, not 5.\n   grame -> not a common word? (but let\'s check: it might be a variant, but we should stick to common words)\n   grape, grave, grate, grase (not a word), graze -> Z is a possibility.\n\n Common words: \n   grape, grave, grate, graze, etc.\n\n We know D is absent, so ""grade"" is out.\n\n We can make a guess that uses one of these and also tests the fourth letter.\n\n However, we have 4 known letters and only one unknown. We can try to guess one of the possibilities.\n\n But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test multiple possibilities? Actually, we can try to guess the word directly.\n\n However, we might not get it on the first try of the possibilities, and we have 4 tries left.\n\n Alternatively, we can make a guess that uses the known pattern and introduces new letters to test? But we only have one missing letter.\n\n But wait: what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, if the word is ""grace"", but C is absent so that\'s not possible. Or ""grape"" has no duplicates.\n\n Since we have no evidence of duplicates, we can assume the fourth letter is a new letter.\n\n We can try to guess ""grape"" to test P. If it\'s correct, we win. If not, we know P is absent and we can try another.\n\n But we can also try to use a word that has the known pattern and also tests other letters that might be in the word? However, the word is almost complete.\n\n Let me list the possible common words that fit ""G R A _ E"":\n   grape (P)\n   grave (V)\n   grate (T)\n   graze (Z)\n   grace (C) -> but C is absent, so invalid.\n   grade (D) -> but D is absent, so invalid.\n   graze is a word.\n\n Other less common: grame (not common), grafe (not a word), etc.\n\n We have four possibilities: P, V, T, Z.\n\n We can try to guess one of them. But if we guess wrong, we get information about that letter.\n\n Alternatively, we can make a guess that uses the pattern and also includes other letters that we haven\'t tested? But we don\'t have any other missing positions.\n\n However, note: we have to fill the fourth position. We cannot leave it blank.\n\n We can try to use a word that has the known letters (G, R, A, E) in the correct positions and a new letter in the fourth, and also includes other new letters? But that\'s not possible because the word must be 5 letters and we have fixed positions 1,2,3,5.\n\n The fourth position is the only one we can change.\n\n Therefore, we must choose a word that is ""G R A ? E"", and the ? is a letter we haven\'t tried and that is not absent.\n\n We have not tried: B, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know C, N, D are absent).\n\n But we are limited to words that exist.\n\n So, we can try:\n\n Option 1: Guess ""grape"" to test P. If P is correct, we win. If not, then P is absent and we try another.\n\n Option 2: Similarly, we can try ""grave"" for V.\n\n But we have 4 tries left, so we can try one.\n\n However, we can also consider: what if we use a word that doesn\'t have the pattern but tests multiple possible letters at once? \n\n For example, we could use a word that has P, V, T, Z in it? But we don\'t have a position for them? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a word that has the known letters in the correct positions and then the fourth letter is one of the candidates? That\'s what we are doing.\n\n But note: we cannot test multiple candidates at once because the fourth position can only be one letter.\n\n So, we have to test one by one.\n\n However, we can also use a word that has the known pattern and also includes a letter that is not in the word? That wouldn\'t help.\n\n Therefore, I think the best is to try one of the candidates.\n\n Let\'s choose the most common word: ""grape"" is common.\n\n But note: we have to consider the frequency of letters. P is a common letter.\n\n Alternatively, we can look at the list of possible words and see which one is more likely.\n\n Without frequency data, we can choose arbitrarily.\n\n I\'ll choose ""grape"" for the third guess.\n\n So, guess: ""grape""\n\n But wait, what if the word is ""grave""? Then we get feedback that P is absent and we know to try V next.\n\n Similarly, if we get all correct, we win.\n\n So, let\'s do that.\n\n<guess>grape</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the second guess ""grade"":\n- G (position 1) is correct (✓), confirming the secret word starts with G.\n- R (position 2) and A (position 3) remain correct (✓), consistent with the first guess.\n- D (position 4) is absent (x), so D is not in the secret word.\n- E (position 5) remains correct (✓).\n\n### Updated Information:\n- **Secret word pattern**: G R A _ E  \n  (positions: 1=G, 2=R, 3=A, 5=E; position 4 is unknown).\n- **Absent letters**: C, N, D (cannot appear anywhere).\n- **Known present letters**: G, R, A, E (all fixed in positions except G is now confirmed at position 1).\n\n### Strategy for the Third Guess:\n- The secret word is **G R A _ E**, with only the fourth letter missing.\n- Possible letters for position 4 must form valid English words (e.g., P for ""grape"", V for ""grave"", T for ""grate"", Z for ""graze"").\n- Since C, N, and D are absent, options like ""grace"" or ""grade"" are invalid.\n- Goal: Test the most common candidate for position 4 while maximizing efficiency. ""Grape"" is a high-frequency word and tests P, a common consonant not yet evaluated.\n\n### Why ""grape""?\n- Tests P in position 4.\n- If correct, the puzzle is solved.\n- If P is absent, we eliminate it and proceed with other candidates (e.g., V, T, Z) in future guesses.\n\n<guess>grape</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: grade -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) R(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: grape -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) R(✓) A(✓) P(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the third guess ""grape"":\n G: ✓ -> correct at position 1 (already known)\n R: ✓ -> correct at position 2 (already known)\n A: ✓ -> correct at position 3 (already known)\n P: x -> not in the word\n E: ✓ -> correct at position 5 (already known)\n\n So, from this we know that the secret word is ""G R A _ E"", and the fourth letter is not P.\n\n Combining previous feedback:\n   Absent letters: C, N, D, P\n\n The secret word pattern is: G R A _ E\n\n We still need to find the fourth letter.
