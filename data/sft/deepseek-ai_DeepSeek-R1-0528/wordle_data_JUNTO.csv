We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since in ""crane"", N is the fourth letter).

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter N, but not in the 4th position. And it does not contain C, R, A, E.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
 1. Does not contain C, R, A, E.
 2. Contains the letter N (but not in the 4th position? Actually, it can be in any position except the 4th? But note: the feedback for N was a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So in the new word, we can try N in a different position to see where it might be).

 However, note that the feedback only tells us that N is in the word and not in the 4th position. It might be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 Also, we have eliminated 4 letters: C, R, A, E.

 We need to pick a word that uses other common letters and includes N.

 Let's think of common letters that are left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know the word must have an N.

 We can try to pick a word that has N and other common letters to get more information.

 Some good starting letters: S, T, L, O, etc.

 Example words: 
   ""POINT"" - but O and I are vowels, and we haven't tested O or I yet? Actually, we haven't tested O, I, etc.

 However, note: we must avoid the letters C, R, A, E.

 Let's try to form a word that has N and other common letters we haven't tried.

 Possibilities: 
   ""LIONS"" -> but S is common, but note: we have 5 letters and we can use this to test multiple new letters.

 But wait: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 However, we must also consider that the N must not be in the 4th position? Actually, in the new word we can put N in any position because we don't know the correct position yet. We are trying to find where N goes.

 But note: the feedback only said that in the first guess (position 4) it was wrong. So we can try N in a different position.

 Let me think of words that have N and avoid C, R, A, E.

 Some words:
   ""POINT"" -> P, O, I, N, T -> none of these are in the forbidden list? 
        P: not forbidden, O: not forbidden, I: not forbidden, N: we know is in the word, T: not forbidden.

   But note: we are not sure if O, I, T are in the word. We are trying to test multiple letters.

   Alternatively, we could use a word that has N and also other common consonants and vowels we haven't tested.

   Another idea: we know the word has N, so we can try to put N in a different position to see if we can get a ✓.

   However, we have 6 tries, so we can also try to get more information about other letters.

   Let me list the letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   We want to test as many of the common ones as possible.

   Common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

   So, a word like ""POINT"" would test P, O, I, N, T. That's 5 new letters.

   But note: we already know N is in the word, so we are really testing P, O, I, T and the position of N.

   Alternatively, we could use ""SLING"" -> S, L, I, N, G. But that has N in the 4th position? In ""SLING"": S(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). But we know that N is not in the 4th position? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess (where N was in the 4th position) it was not correct. But it might be that the word has N in the 4th position? Wait, no: the feedback for the first guess was that N is in the word but not in the 4th position. So the secret word has an N, but not at position 4. Therefore, in the new word, we should avoid putting N at position 4? Actually, we can put it at 4 again? But that would be a waste because we already know it's not there. So we should try a different position.

   Therefore, in the new guess, we should put N in a position that is not 4. So positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

   So ""POINT"" has N in the 4th position? 
        P-O-I-N-T: positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> so N is at 4. We should avoid that.

   We need a word that has N but not at position 4.

   How about ""NOISY""? 
        N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), Y(5) -> N is at 1. This is good because we are testing N at position 1.

   But note: we are also testing O, I, S, Y. And we avoid the forbidden letters.

   Another word: ""JOINT"" -> J is not very common, and we might not want to use a J.

   Another: ""MINTY"" -> M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5) -> N is at 3.

   Or ""TUNIC"" -> but C is forbidden.

   We must avoid C, R, A, E.

   Let me think of words with N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

   Position 1: ""NOISE"", ""NOTES"" -> but E is forbidden? ""NOTES"" has E -> forbidden.

   Position 1 without E: ""NOISY"", ""NOUNS"" (but double N? we don't know if the word has two Ns, but we can try). However, we are only required to have one N? Actually, the feedback for the first guess only said there is at least one N.

   But note: if the word has two Ns, then we might get multiple '-' or one '✓' and one 'x'? It's possible.

   However, we are trying to get maximum information. So we should avoid repeating letters if possible? Because if we use a word with two Ns, we are only testing one new letter (the other N we already know). So it's better to have distinct letters.

   So ""NOISY"": N, O, I, S, Y -> all distinct and none of these are forbidden.

   Similarly, ""MINTY"": M, I, N, T, Y -> distinct.

   But ""MINTY"" has N at position 3.

   Which one to choose? 

   We can also consider the frequency of letters. Common letters: S, T, L, N (we already know N), O, I, etc.

   ""NOISY"" has S and Y, which are common? S is very common.

   Alternatively, we can use a word that has T and S, which are very common.

   How about ""POINT"" but we can't because N is at 4.

   How about ""POINT"" with N moved? We can't change the word arbitrarily.

   Another word: ""STING"" -> S(1), T(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> N at 4 again -> avoid.

   How about ""SUNNY"" -> double N? and U is new, but we are repeating N -> not ideal.

   Let me try to find a word with N at position 2: 
        e.g., ""SNOUT"" -> S(1), N(2), O(3), U(4), T(5) -> but U is less common? and we avoid forbidden letters? S, N, O, U, T: none are forbidden.

   But U is a vowel and we haven't tested it.

   Another: ""INBOX"" -> I(1), N(2), B(3), O(4), X(5) -> but X is rare.

   Another: ""UNTIL"" -> U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), L(5) -> but U is at the start? and we have U and I.

   We want to maximize the chance of hitting the correct letters.

   After some thought, I think ""NOISY"" is a good candidate because:
     - It has N at position 1 (which we haven't tried)
     - It tests O, I, S, Y which are common enough.

   But note: we are also testing the letter Y, which is less common than T, for example.

   Alternatively, we can use ""TUNIS"" -> T(1), U(2), N(3), I(4), S(5) -> N at position 3. This tests T, U, N, I, S. T and S are very common.

   However, ""TUNIS"" is a proper noun? We need a valid English word. ""Tunis"" is the capital of Tunisia, but it might be accepted? But in Wordle, proper nouns are usually not allowed. So we should avoid.

   How about ""POINT"" but without the 4th position for N? We can't.

   Another word: ""JOINS"" -> J is not common, and we might avoid.

   Another: ""MINTS"" -> M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> N at 3, and T and S are common. Also, M and I are common.

   But note: T is at position 4 and S at 5. This seems good.

   ""MINTS"" uses M, I, N, T, S. All distinct and common.

   We know N is in the word, so we are testing M, I, T, S and the position of N (at 3).

   This seems better than ""NOISY"" because it tests T and S which are more common than Y.

   So I'll go with ""MINTS"".

   But wait: the feedback for the first guess said that N is in the word but not at position 4. In ""MINTS"", N is at position 3, which is different. So that's good.

   Therefore, my second guess is ""MINTS"".

   We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

   So the word is ""MINTS"".

   Let me write it in the required format.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, E not in the word; N is in the word but not in position 4), I need to choose a new word that:
- Excludes C, R, A, E
- Includes N (in a position other than 4 to test new locations)
- Tests new common letters to gather more information

I considered words like ""NOISY"" and ""MINTY"" but settled on **""MINTS""** because:
- It places N in position 3 (a new position to check)
- It tests four new common letters: M, I, T, S
- All letters are distinct and high-frequency
- It avoids reused positions for N

This guess maximizes information by covering frequent consonants (M, T, S) and a vowel (I), while respecting the constraints.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since in ""crane"", N is the fourth letter).

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter N, but not in the 4th position. And it does not contain C, R, A, E.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
 1. Does not contain C, R, A, E.
 2. Contains the letter N (but not in the 4th position? Actually, it can be in any position except the 4th? But note: the feedback for N was a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So in the new word, we can try N in a different position to see where it might be).

 However, note that the feedback only tells us that N is in the word and not in the 4th position. It might be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 Also, we have eliminated 4 letters: C, R, A, E.

 We need to pick a word that uses other common letters and includes N.

 Let's think of common letters that are left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know the word must have an N.

 We can try to pick a word that has N and other common letters to get more information.

 Some good starting letters: S, T, L, O, etc.

 Example words: 
   ""POINT"" - but O and I are vowels, and we haven't tested O or I yet? Actually, we haven't tested O, I, etc.

 However, note: we must avoid the letters C, R, A, E.

 Let's try to form a word that has N and other common letters we haven't tried.

 Possibilities: 
   ""LIONS"" -> but S is common, but note: we have 5 letters and we can use this to test multiple new letters.

 But wait: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 However, we must also consider that the N must not be in the 4th position? Actually, in the new word we can put N in any position because we don't know the correct position yet. We are trying to find where N goes.

 But note: the feedback only said that in the first guess (position 4) it was wrong. So we can try N in a different position.

 Let me think of words that have N and avoid C, R, A, E.

 Some words:
   ""POINT"" -> P, O, I, N, T -> none of these are in the forbidden list? 
        P: not forbidden, O: not forbidden, I: not forbidden, N: we know is in the word, T: not forbidden.

   But note: we are not sure if O, I, T are in the word. We are trying to test multiple letters.

   Alternatively, we could use a word that has N and also other common consonants and vowels we haven't tested.

   Another idea: we know the word has N, so we can try to put N in a different position to see if we can get a ✓.

   However, we have 6 tries, so we can also try to get more information about other letters.

   Let me list the letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   We want to test as many of the common ones as possible.

   Common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

   So, a word like ""POINT"" would test P, O, I, N, T. That's 5 new letters.

   But note: we already know N is in the word, so we are really testing P, O, I, T and the position of N.

   Alternatively, we could use ""SLING"" -> S, L, I, N, G. But that has N in the 4th position? In ""SLING"": S(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). But we know that N is not in the 4th position? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess (where N was in the 4th position) it was not correct. But it might be that the word has N in the 4th position? Wait, no: the feedback for the first guess was that N is in the word but not in the 4th position. So the secret word has an N, but not at position 4. Therefore, in the new word, we should avoid putting N at position 4? Actually, we can put it at 4 again? But that would be a waste because we already know it's not there. So we should try a different position.

   Therefore, in the new guess, we should put N in a position that is not 4. So positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

   So ""POINT"" has N in the 4th position? 
        P-O-I-N-T: positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> so N is at 4. We should avoid that.

   We need a word that has N but not at position 4.

   How about ""NOISY""? 
        N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), Y(5) -> N is at 1. This is good because we are testing N at position 1.

   But note: we are also testing O, I, S, Y. And we avoid the forbidden letters.

   Another word: ""JOINT"" -> J is not very common, and we might not want to use a J.

   Another: ""MINTY"" -> M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5) -> N is at 3.

   Or ""TUNIC"" -> but C is forbidden.

   We must avoid C, R, A, E.

   Let me think of words with N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

   Position 1: ""NOISE"", ""NOTES"" -> but E is forbidden? ""NOTES"" has E -> forbidden.

   Position 1 without E: ""NOISY"", ""NOUNS"" (but double N? we don't know if the word has two Ns, but we can try). However, we are only required to have one N? Actually, the feedback for the first guess only said there is at least one N.

   But note: if the word has two Ns, then we might get multiple '-' or one '✓' and one 'x'? It's possible.

   However, we are trying to get maximum information. So we should avoid repeating letters if possible? Because if we use a word with two Ns, we are only testing one new letter (the other N we already know). So it's better to have distinct letters.

   So ""NOISY"": N, O, I, S, Y -> all distinct and none of these are forbidden.

   Similarly, ""MINTY"": M, I, N, T, Y -> distinct.

   But ""MINTY"" has N at position 3.

   Which one to choose? 

   We can also consider the frequency of letters. Common letters: S, T, L, N (we already know N), O, I, etc.

   ""NOISY"" has S and Y, which are common? S is very common.

   Alternatively, we can use a word that has T and S, which are very common.

   How about ""POINT"" but we can't because N is at 4.

   How about ""POINT"" with N moved? We can't change the word arbitrarily.

   Another word: ""STING"" -> S(1), T(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> N at 4 again -> avoid.

   How about ""SUNNY"" -> double N? and U is new, but we are repeating N -> not ideal.

   Let me try to find a word with N at position 2: 
        e.g., ""SNOUT"" -> S(1), N(2), O(3), U(4), T(5) -> but U is less common? and we avoid forbidden letters? S, N, O, U, T: none are forbidden.

   But U is a vowel and we haven't tested it.

   Another: ""INBOX"" -> I(1), N(2), B(3), O(4), X(5) -> but X is rare.

   Another: ""UNTIL"" -> U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), L(5) -> but U is at the start? and we have U and I.

   We want to maximize the chance of hitting the correct letters.

   After some thought, I think ""NOISY"" is a good candidate because:
     - It has N at position 1 (which we haven't tried)
     - It tests O, I, S, Y which are common enough.

   But note: we are also testing the letter Y, which is less common than T, for example.

   Alternatively, we can use ""TUNIS"" -> T(1), U(2), N(3), I(4), S(5) -> N at position 3. This tests T, U, N, I, S. T and S are very common.

   However, ""TUNIS"" is a proper noun? We need a valid English word. ""Tunis"" is the capital of Tunisia, but it might be accepted? But in Wordle, proper nouns are usually not allowed. So we should avoid.

   How about ""POINT"" but without the 4th position for N? We can't.

   Another word: ""JOINS"" -> J is not common, and we might avoid.

   Another: ""MINTS"" -> M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> N at 3, and T and S are common. Also, M and I are common.

   But note: T is at position 4 and S at 5. This seems good.

   ""MINTS"" uses M, I, N, T, S. All distinct and common.

   We know N is in the word, so we are testing M, I, T, S and the position of N (at 3).

   This seems better than ""NOISY"" because it tests T and S which are more common than Y.

   So I'll go with ""MINTS"".

   But wait: the feedback for the first guess said that N is in the word but not at position 4. In ""MINTS"", N is at position 3, which is different. So that's good.

   Therefore, my second guess is ""MINTS"".

   We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

   So the word is ""MINTS"".

   Let me write it in the required format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, E not in the word; N is in the word but not in position 4), I need to choose a new word that:
- Excludes C, R, A, E
- Includes N (in a position other than 4 to test new locations)
- Tests new common letters to gather more information

I considered words like ""NOISY"" and ""MINTY"" but settled on **""MINTS""** because:
- It places N in position 3 (a new position to check)
- It tests four new common letters: M, I, T, S
- All letters are distinct and high-frequency
- It avoids reused positions for N

This guess maximizes information by covering frequent consonants (M, T, S) and a vowel (I), while respecting the constraints.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Meaning:
  C, R, A, E are not in the word.
  N is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 2: ""mints"" -> M(x), I(x), N(✓), T(✓), S(x)
Meaning:
  M, I, S are not in the word.
  N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, because in ""mints"", N is the third letter).
  T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, because in ""mints"", T is the fourth letter).

So, from both guesses, we know:

- The secret word has the letter N in the third position and T in the fourth position.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, E, M, I, S.

Also, from the first guess, we know that N is not in position 4 (which we now know is correct because T is in position 4) and that the word has an N (which we now know is at position 3).

So the secret word has the form: _ _ N T _

We need to fill in the first, second, and fifth positions.

We also know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, M, I, S.

We can list the available letters (consonants and vowels) that we haven't tried:

Vowels left: O, U (since A, E, I are out)
Consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, V, W, X, Y, Z (C, R, M, S are out)

We need to form a 5-letter word of the form _ _ N T _

We can think of words that end with ""NT"", but note the third letter is fixed as N and fourth as T, so the last part is ""NT"" and then the fifth letter.

Common patterns: words like ""COUNT"", ""POINT"", but note:
  - ""POINT"" has P, O, I, N, T -> but I is out (from guess2: I(x)), so not possible.
  - ""COUNT"" has C, O, U, N, T -> but C is out (from guess1: C(x)).

We need to avoid the forbidden letters.

Possible words: 
  The fifth letter can be a vowel (O, U) or a consonant.

Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and use only the available letters.

We have two positions: first and second, and fifth.

We can try to use a word that tests common letters for the first, second, and fifth positions.

Available common letters: O, U, L, P, D, B, G, H, etc.

We can try ""HUNT"" but that's 4 letters. We need 5.

5-letter words: 
  ...N T _ 

Examples:
  - ""POINT"" -> not possible (I and C? Actually, P is allowed, but I is not. So no).
  - ""COUNT"" -> C is not allowed.
  - ""MOUNT"" -> M is not allowed (from guess2: M(x)).
  - ""VAUNT"" -> V is allowed? Let's check: V, A -> but A is not allowed (from guess1: A(x)).
  - ""DAUNT"" -> D, A -> A not allowed.
  - ""GAUNT"" -> G, A -> A not allowed.
  - ""HAUNT"" -> H, A -> A not allowed.
  - ""JAUNT"" -> J, A -> A not allowed and J is not common.

What about words that don't have A? 

  - ""BUNTS"" -> B, U, N, T, S -> but S is not allowed (from guess2: S(x)).
  - ""DUNTS"" -> D, U, N, T, S -> S not allowed.
  - ""HUNTS"" -> H, U, N, T, S -> S not allowed.
  - ""PUNTS"" -> P, U, N, T, S -> S not allowed.

We need the fifth letter to not be S and not any of the forbidden letters.

What about words ending with ""NT"" and then a vowel? But the fifth letter must be a consonant? Not necessarily, it can be a vowel? Actually, the word must be 5 letters.

Let me think of words: 
  ""FRONT"" -> F, R, O, N, T -> but R is not allowed (from guess1: R(x)).
  ""GRANT"" -> G, R, A, N, T -> R and A not allowed.
  ""PRINT"" -> P, R, I, N, T -> R and I not allowed.

We are having trouble. Maybe we need to consider that the fifth letter might be a vowel? But the pattern is _ _ N T _ , so the last letter is the fifth.

Words that end with ""T"" and the fifth letter is a vowel? Actually, no, because the fourth is T and fifth is separate.

For example, ""POINT"" ends with T? No, it ends with T? Actually, ""POINT"" is P-O-I-N-T, so the fifth letter is T? But in our pattern, the fourth is T, so the fifth is after T? That would be words that have a letter after T? 

But our pattern is: position 3: N, position 4: T, so position 5: some letter.

So the word ends with ""NT"" and then one more letter? Actually, no: the word has five letters: 
  position1: ?
  position2: ?
  position3: N
  position4: T
  position5: ?

So the word is: ? ? N T ?

We need a word that has the third letter N and fourth letter T.

Examples of such words in English:

  - ""COUNT"" -> C-O-U-N-T -> but C is out.
  - ""MOUNT"" -> M-O-U-N-T -> M is out.
  - ""POINT"" -> P-O-I-N-T -> I is out.
  - ""JAUNT"" -> J-A-U-N-T -> A is out and J is not common.
  - ""HAUNT"" -> H-A-U-N-T -> A is out.
  - ""GAUNT"" -> G-A-U-N-T -> A out.
  - ""DAUNT"" -> D-A-U-N-T -> A out.
  - ""VAUNT"" -> V-A-U-N-T -> A out.

  - ""BUNTS"" -> B-U-N-T-S -> S is out.
  - ""DUNTS"" -> D-U-N-T-S -> S out.
  - ""HUNTS"" -> H-U-N-T-S -> S out.
  - ""LUNTS"" -> L-U-N-T-S -> S out.
  - ""PUNTS"" -> P-U-N-T-S -> S out.

  - ""WONT"" is 4 letters.

  - ""AUNTY"" -> but A is out and the pattern is not ...NT? A-U-N-T-Y -> that would be positions: 1:A, 2:U, 3:N, 4:T, 5:Y -> but A is out.

  - ""UNTIL"" -> U-N-T-I-L -> but that has N at position 2 and T at position 3? Not matching (we need N at 3 and T at 4).

  - ""ANTIC"" -> A is out and pattern not matching.

  - ""ENTER"" -> E is out.

  - ""ONTO"" is 4 letters.

  - ""ONTIC"" -> O-N-T-I-C -> but that has N at 2 and T at 3? Not matching.

We need to find words that have N at 3 and T at 4.

Let me search for words that have ""NT"" in the middle and then a fifth letter? Actually, the pattern is fixed: the third letter is N and the fourth is T, so the substring from position 3 to 4 is ""NT"".

So we are looking for words of the form: ?? + ""NT"" + ?

The word must be 5 letters: [letter1][letter2] N T [letter5]

We can use a word list or think of common words.

Another idea: ""BENT"" is 4 letters. 

What about ""BONUS""? -> B-O-N-U-S -> but that has N at position 3, but then the fourth letter is U, not T. So no.

""POINT"" is the classic, but we can't use it because of I.

""JOINT"" -> same issue with I? Actually, ""JOINT"" has I at position 3? J-O-I-N-T -> no, that's J(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). But we need N at 3 and T at 4. So that doesn't match.

We need N at 3 and T at 4.

Let me think: 
  ""COUNT"" has: C(1), O(2), U(3)? No: C(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), T(5) -> that's N at 4 and T at 5, not what we need.

We need N at position 3 and T at position 4.

So the word has:
  position 1: ?
  position 2: ?
  position 3: N
  position 4: T
  position 5: ?

So the word ends with ""T"" at position 4? Then position 5 is the last letter.

Examples: 
  ""ANTE"" is 4 letters.

  ""NUT"" is 3.

  ""MINTS"" we already tried, which is M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> but S is out.

  But we need a word without S at the end.

  ""MINTY"" -> M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but M and I are out.

  ""PANTY"" -> P(1), A(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5) -> A is out.

  ""WONT"" is 4 letters.

  ""DONUT"" -> D(1), O(2), N(3), U(4), T(5) -> that's N at 3, but T at 5, not at 4. So the fourth letter is U.

  We need T at 4.

  ""DONUT"" is D-O-N-U-T -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:N, 4:U, 5:T -> so T is at 5, not 4.

  ""TONIC"" -> T(1), O(2), N(3), I(4), C(5) -> I and C are out.

  ""CONIC"" -> C and I out.

  ""IONIC"" -> I and C out.

  ""SONIC"" -> S and I and C out.

  ""TONGS"" -> T(1), O(2), N(3), G(4), S(5) -> S is out.

  ""TANGY"" -> T(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5) -> A is out.

  ""BINGO"" -> B(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), O(5) -> I is out and the fourth letter is G, not T.

  ""BINGO"" doesn't have T.

  ""LINGO"" -> L(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), O(5) -> I out.

  ""MONTH"" -> M(1), O(2), N(3), T(4), H(5) -> M is out, but H is allowed? Let's see: M is out, so we can't use M.

  ""MONTH"" is not allowed because of M.

  ""Ninth"" -> N(1), I(2), N(3) -> wait, that's not 5 letters? ""NINTH"" is N-I-N-T-H -> positions: 1:N, 2:I, 3:N, 4:T, 5:H -> but I is out and also we have two N's? But we don't know if the word has two N's. However, I is out, so not allowed.

  ""BENCH"" -> E is out.

  ""LUNCH"" -> U is allowed, but the pattern: L(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5) -> but C is out.

  ""PUNCH"" -> same issue with C.

  ""HUNCH"" -> same.

  ""BUNCH"" -> same.

  ""DUNCE"" -> E is out.

  ""FUNKY"" -> F(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5) -> but we need T at position 4, but here it's K. So not matching.

  We need the fourth letter to be T.

  ""FUNKY"" has K at 4.

  ""PUNKY"" -> same.

  ""JUNTA"" -> J(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), A(5) -> A is out.

  ""JUNTO"" -> J(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), O(5) -> this fits the pattern: positions 3:N, 4:T, and the letters are J, U, N, T, O.

  But J is not a very common letter, and we haven't tried J. But it is allowed because it's not in the forbidden list.

  However, we want to test common letters. But we are constrained.

  ""JUNTO"" is a word meaning a political group.

  But let's see if there are better options.

  ""HUNTS"" is out because of S.

  ""PUNTO"" -> P(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), O(5) -> this is a valid word (meaning a point in fencing or a punctuation mark). And it uses P, U, O which are common.

  So ""PUNTO"" has:
      P: not tried (allowed)
      U: not tried (vowel)
      N: already known and in position 3 (which is correct, so we expect a ✓ for N and T)
      T: already known and in position 4 (✓)
      O: not tried

  This seems good because it tests P, U, and O.

  We can also consider ""BUNTO"" but I'm not sure if it's a word.

  ""BUNTO"" is not a common word.

  ""DONUT"" doesn't have T at 4.

  So ""PUNTO"" is a valid option.

  Another option: ""COUNT"" is out because of C.

  ""MOUNT"" is out because of M.

  ""VAUNT"" is out because of A.

  So ""PUNTO"" seems like a good guess.

  We can also consider ""WONT"" but it's 4 letters.

  Or ""WONTS"" -> but S is out.

  ""ONTIC"" is not matching.

  So I think ""PUNTO"" is a reasonable guess.

  We'll guess ""PUNTO"" to test P, U, and O.

  If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

  The expected feedback for N and T should be ✓ because we know they are in the correct positions.

  But we are testing the other letters.

  So let's go with ""PUNTO"".

  Format: <guess>punto</guess>

But wait, let's double-check the pattern: 
  P U N T O -> positions: 1:P, 2:U, 3:N, 4:T, 5:O -> yes, N at 3 and T at 4.

And the letters P, U, O are not forbidden.

So this is valid.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, R, A, E are not in the word. N is in the word but not in position 4.
- **Guess 2 (MINTS)**: M, I, S are not in the word. N is correct and in position 3. T is correct and in position 4.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ N T _` (N in position 3, T in position 4).
- Excluded letters: **C, R, A, E, M, I, S** (cannot appear in the word).
- Remaining vowels to test: **O, U**.
- Remaining common consonants to test: **B, D, G, H, L, P, Y**.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Focus on the unknown positions (1, 2, and 5) while testing new high-frequency letters.
- Prioritize words that fit the `_ _ N T _` pattern and include untested letters like **O, U, P, L, D**.
- Avoid reused letters and excluded letters.

After evaluating possible words (e.g., ""POINT"" invalid due to I, ""COUNT"" invalid due to C, ""MONTH"" invalid due to M), **PUNTO** is a strong choice:
- **P**: Untested common consonant.
- **U**: Untested vowel.
- **N**: Already confirmed in position 3 (expected ✓).
- **T**: Already confirmed in position 4 (expected ✓).
- **O**: Untested vowel.

This guess efficiently tests new letters (P, U, O) while respecting the known constraints and pattern.

<guess>punto</guess>",punto,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Meaning:
  C, R, A, E are not in the word.
  N is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 2: ""mints"" -> M(x), I(x), N(✓), T(✓), S(x)
Meaning:
  M, I, S are not in the word.
  N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, because in ""mints"", N is the third letter).
  T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, because in ""mints"", T is the fourth letter).

So, from both guesses, we know:

- The secret word has the letter N in the third position and T in the fourth position.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, E, M, I, S.

Also, from the first guess, we know that N is not in position 4 (which we now know is correct because T is in position 4) and that the word has an N (which we now know is at position 3).

So the secret word has the form: _ _ N T _

We need to fill in the first, second, and fifth positions.

We also know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, M, I, S.

We can list the available letters (consonants and vowels) that we haven't tried:

Vowels left: O, U (since A, E, I are out)
Consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, V, W, X, Y, Z (C, R, M, S are out)

We need to form a 5-letter word of the form _ _ N T _

We can think of words that end with ""NT"", but note the third letter is fixed as N and fourth as T, so the last part is ""NT"" and then the fifth letter.

Common patterns: words like ""COUNT"", ""POINT"", but note:
  - ""POINT"" has P, O, I, N, T -> but I is out (from guess2: I(x)), so not possible.
  - ""COUNT"" has C, O, U, N, T -> but C is out (from guess1: C(x)).

We need to avoid the forbidden letters.

Possible words: 
  The fifth letter can be a vowel (O, U) or a consonant.

Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and use only the available letters.

We have two positions: first and second, and fifth.

We can try to use a word that tests common letters for the first, second, and fifth positions.

Available common letters: O, U, L, P, D, B, G, H, etc.

We can try ""HUNT"" but that's 4 letters. We need 5.

5-letter words: 
  ...N T _ 

Examples:
  - ""POINT"" -> not possible (I and C? Actually, P is allowed, but I is not. So no).
  - ""COUNT"" -> C is not allowed.
  - ""MOUNT"" -> M is not allowed (from guess2: M(x)).
  - ""VAUNT"" -> V is allowed? Let's check: V, A -> but A is not allowed (from guess1: A(x)).
  - ""DAUNT"" -> D, A -> A not allowed.
  - ""GAUNT"" -> G, A -> A not allowed.
  - ""HAUNT"" -> H, A -> A not allowed.
  - ""JAUNT"" -> J, A -> A not allowed and J is not common.

What about words that don't have A? 

  - ""BUNTS"" -> B, U, N, T, S -> but S is not allowed (from guess2: S(x)).
  - ""DUNTS"" -> D, U, N, T, S -> S not allowed.
  - ""HUNTS"" -> H, U, N, T, S -> S not allowed.
  - ""PUNTS"" -> P, U, N, T, S -> S not allowed.

We need the fifth letter to not be S and not any of the forbidden letters.

What about words ending with ""NT"" and then a vowel? But the fifth letter must be a consonant? Not necessarily, it can be a vowel? Actually, the word must be 5 letters.

Let me think of words: 
  ""FRONT"" -> F, R, O, N, T -> but R is not allowed (from guess1: R(x)).
  ""GRANT"" -> G, R, A, N, T -> R and A not allowed.
  ""PRINT"" -> P, R, I, N, T -> R and I not allowed.

We are having trouble. Maybe we need to consider that the fifth letter might be a vowel? But the pattern is _ _ N T _ , so the last letter is the fifth.

Words that end with ""T"" and the fifth letter is a vowel? Actually, no, because the fourth is T and fifth is separate.

For example, ""POINT"" ends with T? No, it ends with T? Actually, ""POINT"" is P-O-I-N-T, so the fifth letter is T? But in our pattern, the fourth is T, so the fifth is after T? That would be words that have a letter after T? 

But our pattern is: position 3: N, position 4: T, so position 5: some letter.

So the word ends with ""NT"" and then one more letter? Actually, no: the word has five letters: 
  position1: ?
  position2: ?
  position3: N
  position4: T
  position5: ?

So the word is: ? ? N T ?

We need a word that has the third letter N and fourth letter T.

Examples of such words in English:

  - ""COUNT"" -> C-O-U-N-T -> but C is out.
  - ""MOUNT"" -> M-O-U-N-T -> M is out.
  - ""POINT"" -> P-O-I-N-T -> I is out.
  - ""JAUNT"" -> J-A-U-N-T -> A is out and J is not common.
  - ""HAUNT"" -> H-A-U-N-T -> A is out.
  - ""GAUNT"" -> G-A-U-N-T -> A out.
  - ""DAUNT"" -> D-A-U-N-T -> A out.
  - ""VAUNT"" -> V-A-U-N-T -> A out.

  - ""BUNTS"" -> B-U-N-T-S -> S is out.
  - ""DUNTS"" -> D-U-N-T-S -> S out.
  - ""HUNTS"" -> H-U-N-T-S -> S out.
  - ""LUNTS"" -> L-U-N-T-S -> S out.
  - ""PUNTS"" -> P-U-N-T-S -> S out.

  - ""WONT"" is 4 letters.

  - ""AUNTY"" -> but A is out and the pattern is not ...NT? A-U-N-T-Y -> that would be positions: 1:A, 2:U, 3:N, 4:T, 5:Y -> but A is out.

  - ""UNTIL"" -> U-N-T-I-L -> but that has N at position 2 and T at position 3? Not matching (we need N at 3 and T at 4).

  - ""ANTIC"" -> A is out and pattern not matching.

  - ""ENTER"" -> E is out.

  - ""ONTO"" is 4 letters.

  - ""ONTIC"" -> O-N-T-I-C -> but that has N at 2 and T at 3? Not matching.

We need to find words that have N at 3 and T at 4.

Let me search for words that have ""NT"" in the middle and then a fifth letter? Actually, the pattern is fixed: the third letter is N and the fourth is T, so the substring from position 3 to 4 is ""NT"".

So we are looking for words of the form: ?? + ""NT"" + ?

The word must be 5 letters: [letter1][letter2] N T [letter5]

We can use a word list or think of common words.

Another idea: ""BENT"" is 4 letters. 

What about ""BONUS""? -> B-O-N-U-S -> but that has N at position 3, but then the fourth letter is U, not T. So no.

""POINT"" is the classic, but we can't use it because of I.

""JOINT"" -> same issue with I? Actually, ""JOINT"" has I at position 3? J-O-I-N-T -> no, that's J(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). But we need N at 3 and T at 4. So that doesn't match.

We need N at 3 and T at 4.

Let me think: 
  ""COUNT"" has: C(1), O(2), U(3)? No: C(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), T(5) -> that's N at 4 and T at 5, not what we need.

We need N at position 3 and T at position 4.

So the word has:
  position 1: ?
  position 2: ?
  position 3: N
  position 4: T
  position 5: ?

So the word ends with ""T"" at position 4? Then position 5 is the last letter.

Examples: 
  ""ANTE"" is 4 letters.

  ""NUT"" is 3.

  ""MINTS"" we already tried, which is M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> but S is out.

  But we need a word without S at the end.

  ""MINTY"" -> M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but M and I are out.

  ""PANTY"" -> P(1), A(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5) -> A is out.

  ""WONT"" is 4 letters.

  ""DONUT"" -> D(1), O(2), N(3), U(4), T(5) -> that's N at 3, but T at 5, not at 4. So the fourth letter is U.

  We need T at 4.

  ""DONUT"" is D-O-N-U-T -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:N, 4:U, 5:T -> so T is at 5, not 4.

  ""TONIC"" -> T(1), O(2), N(3), I(4), C(5) -> I and C are out.

  ""CONIC"" -> C and I out.

  ""IONIC"" -> I and C out.

  ""SONIC"" -> S and I and C out.

  ""TONGS"" -> T(1), O(2), N(3), G(4), S(5) -> S is out.

  ""TANGY"" -> T(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5) -> A is out.

  ""BINGO"" -> B(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), O(5) -> I is out and the fourth letter is G, not T.

  ""BINGO"" doesn't have T.

  ""LINGO"" -> L(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), O(5) -> I out.

  ""MONTH"" -> M(1), O(2), N(3), T(4), H(5) -> M is out, but H is allowed? Let's see: M is out, so we can't use M.

  ""MONTH"" is not allowed because of M.

  ""Ninth"" -> N(1), I(2), N(3) -> wait, that's not 5 letters? ""NINTH"" is N-I-N-T-H -> positions: 1:N, 2:I, 3:N, 4:T, 5:H -> but I is out and also we have two N's? But we don't know if the word has two N's. However, I is out, so not allowed.

  ""BENCH"" -> E is out.

  ""LUNCH"" -> U is allowed, but the pattern: L(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5) -> but C is out.

  ""PUNCH"" -> same issue with C.

  ""HUNCH"" -> same.

  ""BUNCH"" -> same.

  ""DUNCE"" -> E is out.

  ""FUNKY"" -> F(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5) -> but we need T at position 4, but here it's K. So not matching.

  We need the fourth letter to be T.

  ""FUNKY"" has K at 4.

  ""PUNKY"" -> same.

  ""JUNTA"" -> J(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), A(5) -> A is out.

  ""JUNTO"" -> J(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), O(5) -> this fits the pattern: positions 3:N, 4:T, and the letters are J, U, N, T, O.

  But J is not a very common letter, and we haven't tried J. But it is allowed because it's not in the forbidden list.

  However, we want to test common letters. But we are constrained.

  ""JUNTO"" is a word meaning a political group.

  But let's see if there are better options.

  ""HUNTS"" is out because of S.

  ""PUNTO"" -> P(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), O(5) -> this is a valid word (meaning a point in fencing or a punctuation mark). And it uses P, U, O which are common.

  So ""PUNTO"" has:
      P: not tried (allowed)
      U: not tried (vowel)
      N: already known and in position 3 (which is correct, so we expect a ✓ for N and T)
      T: already known and in position 4 (✓)
      O: not tried

  This seems good because it tests P, U, and O.

  We can also consider ""BUNTO"" but I'm not sure if it's a word.

  ""BUNTO"" is not a common word.

  ""DONUT"" doesn't have T at 4.

  So ""PUNTO"" is a valid option.

  Another option: ""COUNT"" is out because of C.

  ""MOUNT"" is out because of M.

  ""VAUNT"" is out because of A.

  So ""PUNTO"" seems like a good guess.

  We can also consider ""WONT"" but it's 4 letters.

  Or ""WONTS"" -> but S is out.

  ""ONTIC"" is not matching.

  So I think ""PUNTO"" is a reasonable guess.

  We'll guess ""PUNTO"" to test P, U, and O.

  If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

  The expected feedback for N and T should be ✓ because we know they are in the correct positions.

  But we are testing the other letters.

  So let's go with ""PUNTO"".

  Format: <guess>punto</guess>

But wait, let's double-check the pattern: 
  P U N T O -> positions: 1:P, 2:U, 3:N, 4:T, 5:O -> yes, N at 3 and T at 4.

And the letters P, U, O are not forbidden.

So this is valid.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, R, A, E are not in the word. N is in the word but not in position 4.
- **Guess 2 (MINTS)**: M, I, S are not in the word. N is correct and in position 3. T is correct and in position 4.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ N T _` (N in position 3, T in position 4).
- Excluded letters: **C, R, A, E, M, I, S** (cannot appear in the word).
- Remaining vowels to test: **O, U**.
- Remaining common consonants to test: **B, D, G, H, L, P, Y**.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Focus on the unknown positions (1, 2, and 5) while testing new high-frequency letters.
- Prioritize words that fit the `_ _ N T _` pattern and include untested letters like **O, U, P, L, D**.
- Avoid reused letters and excluded letters.

After evaluating possible words (e.g., ""POINT"" invalid due to I, ""COUNT"" invalid due to C, ""MONTH"" invalid due to M), **PUNTO** is a strong choice:
- **P**: Untested common consonant.
- **U**: Untested vowel.
- **N**: Already confirmed in position 3 (expected ✓).
- **T**: Already confirmed in position 4 (expected ✓).
- **O**: Untested vowel.

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since in ""crane"", N is the fourth letter).

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter N, but not in the 4th position. And it does not contain C, R, A, E.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
 1. Does not contain C, R, A, E.
 2. Contains the letter N (but not in the 4th position? Actually, it can be in any position except the 4th? But note: the feedback for N was a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So in the new word, we can try N in a different position to see where it might be).

 However, note that the feedback only tells us that N is in the word and not in the 4th position. It might be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 Also, we have eliminated 4 letters: C, R, A, E.

 We need to pick a word that uses other common letters and includes N.

 Let's think of common letters that are left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know the word must have an N.

 We can try to pick a word that has N and other common letters to get more information.

 Some good starting letters: S, T, L, O, etc.

 Example words: 
   ""POINT"" - but O and I are vowels, and we haven't tested O or I yet? Actually, we haven't tested O, I, etc.

 However, note: we must avoid the letters C, R, A, E.

 Let's try to form a word that has N and other common letters we haven't tried.

 Possibilities: 
   ""LIONS"" -> but S is common, but note: we have 5 letters and we can use this to test multiple new letters.

 But wait: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 However, we must also consider that the N must not be in the 4th position? Actually, in the new word we can put N in any position because we don't know the correct position yet. We are trying to find where N goes.

 But note: the feedback only said that in the first guess (position 4) it was wrong. So we can try N in a different position.

 Let me think of words that have N and avoid C, R, A, E.

 Some words:
   ""POINT"" -> P, O, I, N, T -> none of these are in the forbidden list? 
        P: not forbidden, O: not forbidden, I: not forbidden, N: we know is in the word, T: not forbidden.

   But note: we are not sure if O, I, T are in the word. We are trying to test multiple letters.

   Alternatively, we could use a word that has N and also other common consonants and vowels we haven't tested.

   Another idea: we know the word has N, so we can try to put N in a different position to see if we can get a ✓.

   However, we have 6 tries, so we can also try to get more information about other letters.

   Let me list the letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   We want to test as many of the common ones as possible.

   Common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

   So, a word like ""POINT"" would test P, O, I, N, T. That's 5 new letters.

   But note: we already know N is in the word, so we are really testing P, O, I, T and the position of N.

   Alternatively, we could use ""SLING"" -> S, L, I, N, G. But that has N in the 4th position? In ""SLING"": S(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). But we know that N is not in the 4th position? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess (where N was in the 4th position) it was not correct. But it might be that the word has N in the 4th position? Wait, no: the feedback for the first guess was that N is in the word but not in the 4th position. So the secret word has an N, but not at position 4. Therefore, in the new word, we should avoid putting N at position 4? Actually, we can put it at 4 again? But that would be a waste because we already know it's not there. So we should try a different position.

   Therefore, in the new guess, we should put N in a position that is not 4. So positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

   So ""POINT"" has N in the 4th position? 
        P-O-I-N-T: positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> so N is at 4. We should avoid that.

   We need a word that has N but not at position 4.

   How about ""NOISY""? 
        N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), Y(5) -> N is at 1. This is good because we are testing N at position 1.

   But note: we are also testing O, I, S, Y. And we avoid the forbidden letters.

   Another word: ""JOINT"" -> J is not very common, and we might not want to use a J.

   Another: ""MINTY"" -> M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5) -> N is at 3.

   Or ""TUNIC"" -> but C is forbidden.

   We must avoid C, R, A, E.

   Let me think of words with N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

   Position 1: ""NOISE"", ""NOTES"" -> but E is forbidden? ""NOTES"" has E -> forbidden.

   Position 1 without E: ""NOISY"", ""NOUNS"" (but double N? we don't know if the word has two Ns, but we can try). However, we are only required to have one N? Actually, the feedback for the first guess only said there is at least one N.

   But note: if the word has two Ns, then we might get multiple '-' or one '✓' and one 'x'? It's possible.

   However, we are trying to get maximum information. So we should avoid repeating letters if possible? Because if we use a word with two Ns, we are only testing one new letter (the other N we already know). So it's better to have distinct letters.

   So ""NOISY"": N, O, I, S, Y -> all distinct and none of these are forbidden.

   Similarly, ""MINTY"": M, I, N, T, Y -> distinct.

   But ""MINTY"" has N at position 3.

   Which one to choose? 

   We can also consider the frequency of letters. Common letters: S, T, L, N (we already know N), O, I, etc.

   ""NOISY"" has S and Y, which are common? S is very common.

   Alternatively, we can use a word that has T and S, which are very common.

   How about ""POINT"" but we can't because N is at 4.

   How about ""POINT"" with N moved? We can't change the word arbitrarily.

   Another word: ""STING"" -> S(1), T(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> N at 4 again -> avoid.

   How about ""SUNNY"" -> double N? and U is new, but we are repeating N -> not ideal.

   Let me try to find a word with N at position 2: 
        e.g., ""SNOUT"" -> S(1), N(2), O(3), U(4), T(5) -> but U is less common? and we avoid forbidden letters? S, N, O, U, T: none are forbidden.

   But U is a vowel and we haven't tested it.

   Another: ""INBOX"" -> I(1), N(2), B(3), O(4), X(5) -> but X is rare.

   Another: ""UNTIL"" -> U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), L(5) -> but U is at the start? and we have U and I.

   We want to maximize the chance of hitting the correct letters.

   After some thought, I think ""NOISY"" is a good candidate because:
     - It has N at position 1 (which we haven't tried)
     - It tests O, I, S, Y which are common enough.

   But note: we are also testing the letter Y, which is less common than T, for example.

   Alternatively, we can use ""TUNIS"" -> T(1), U(2), N(3), I(4), S(5) -> N at position 3. This tests T, U, N, I, S. T and S are very common.

   However, ""TUNIS"" is a proper noun? We need a valid English word. ""Tunis"" is the capital of Tunisia, but it might be accepted? But in Wordle, proper nouns are usually not allowed. So we should avoid.

   How about ""POINT"" but without the 4th position for N? We can't.

   Another word: ""JOINS"" -> J is not common, and we might avoid.

   Another: ""MINTS"" -> M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> N at 3, and T and S are common. Also, M and I are common.

   But note: T is at position 4 and S at 5. This seems good.

   ""MINTS"" uses M, I, N, T, S. All distinct and common.

   We know N is in the word, so we are testing M, I, T, S and the position of N (at 3).

   This seems better than ""NOISY"" because it tests T and S which are more common than Y.

   So I'll go with ""MINTS"".

   But wait: the feedback for the first guess said that N is in the word but not at position 4. In ""MINTS"", N is at position 3, which is different. So that's good.

   Therefore, my second guess is ""MINTS"".

   We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

   So the word is ""MINTS"".

   Let me write it in the required format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, E not in the word; N is in the word but not in position 4), I need to choose a new word that:
- Excludes C, R, A, E
- Includes N (in a position other than 4 to test new locations)
- Tests new common letters to gather more information

I considered words like ""NOISY"" and ""MINTY"" but settled on **""MINTS""** because:
- It places N in position 3 (a new position to check)
- It tests four new common letters: M, I, T, S
- All letters are distinct and high-frequency
- It avoids reused positions for N

This guess maximizes information by covering frequent consonants (M, T, S) and a vowel (I), while respecting the constraints.

<guess>mints</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: mints -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(✓) T(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Meaning:
  C, R, A, E are not in the word.
  N is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 2: ""mints"" -> M(x), I(x), N(✓), T(✓), S(x)
Meaning:
  M, I, S are not in the word.
  N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, because in ""mints"", N is the third letter).
  T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, because in ""mints"", T is the fourth letter).

So, from both guesses, we know:

- The secret word has the letter N in the third position and T in the fourth position.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, E, M, I, S.

Also, from the first guess, we know that N is not in position 4 (which we now know is correct because T is in position 4) and that the word has an N (which we now know is at position 3).

So the secret word has the form: _ _ N T _

We need to fill in the first, second, and fifth positions.

We also know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, M, I, S.

We can list the available letters (consonants and vowels) that we haven't tried:

Vowels left: O, U (since A, E, I are out)
Consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, V, W, X, Y, Z (C, R, M, S are out)

We need to form a 5-letter word of the form _ _ N T _

We can think of words that end with ""NT"", but note the third letter is fixed as N and fourth as T, so the last part is ""NT"" and then the fifth letter.

Common patterns: words like ""COUNT"", ""POINT"", but note:
  - ""POINT"" has P, O, I, N, T -> but I is out (from guess2: I(x)), so not possible.
  - ""COUNT"" has C, O, U, N, T -> but C is out (from guess1: C(x)).

We need to avoid the forbidden letters.

Possible words: 
  The fifth letter can be a vowel (O, U) or a consonant.

Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and use only the available letters.

We have two positions: first and second, and fifth.

We can try to use a word that tests common letters for the first, second, and fifth positions.

Available common letters: O, U, L, P, D, B, G, H, etc.

We can try ""HUNT"" but that's 4 letters. We need 5.

5-letter words: 
  ...N T _ 

Examples:
  - ""POINT"" -> not possible (I and C? Actually, P is allowed, but I is not. So no).
  - ""COUNT"" -> C is not allowed.
  - ""MOUNT"" -> M is not allowed (from guess2: M(x)).
  - ""VAUNT"" -> V is allowed? Let's check: V, A -> but A is not allowed (from guess1: A(x)).
  - ""DAUNT"" -> D, A -> A not allowed.
  - ""GAUNT"" -> G, A -> A not allowed.
  - ""HAUNT"" -> H, A -> A not allowed.
  - ""JAUNT"" -> J, A -> A not allowed and J is not common.

What about words that don't have A? 

  - ""BUNTS"" -> B, U, N, T, S -> but S is not allowed (from guess2: S(x)).
  - ""DUNTS"" -> D, U, N, T, S -> S not allowed.
  - ""HUNTS"" -> H, U, N, T, S -> S not allowed.
  - ""PUNTS"" -> P, U, N, T, S -> S not allowed.

We need the fifth letter to not be S and not any of the forbidden letters.

What about words ending with ""NT"" and then a vowel? But the fifth letter must be a consonant? Not necessarily, it can be a vowel? Actually, the word must be 5 letters.

Let me think of words: 
  ""FRONT"" -> F, R, O, N, T -> but R is not allowed (from guess1: R(x)).
  ""GRANT"" -> G, R, A, N, T -> R and A not allowed.
  ""PRINT"" -> P, R, I, N, T -> R and I not allowed.

We are having trouble. Maybe we need to consider that the fifth letter might be a vowel? But the pattern is _ _ N T _ , so the last letter is the fifth.

Words that end with ""T"" and the fifth letter is a vowel? Actually, no, because the fourth is T and fifth is separate.

For example, ""POINT"" ends with T? No, it ends with T? Actually, ""POINT"" is P-O-I-N-T, so the fifth letter is T? But in our pattern, the fourth is T, so the fifth is after T? That would be words that have a letter after T? 

But our pattern is: position 3: N, position 4: T, so position 5: some letter.

So the word ends with ""NT"" and then one more letter? Actually, no: the word has five letters: 
  position1: ?
  position2: ?
  position3: N
  position4: T
  position5: ?

So the word is: ? ? N T ?

We need a word that has the third letter N and fourth letter T.

Examples of such words in English:

  - ""COUNT"" -> C-O-U-N-T -> but C is out.
  - ""MOUNT"" -> M-O-U-N-T -> M is out.
  - ""POINT"" -> P-O-I-N-T -> I is out.
  - ""JAUNT"" -> J-A-U-N-T -> A is out and J is not common.
  - ""HAUNT"" -> H-A-U-N-T -> A is out.
  - ""GAUNT"" -> G-A-U-N-T -> A out.
  - ""DAUNT"" -> D-A-U-N-T -> A out.
  - ""VAUNT"" -> V-A-U-N-T -> A out.

  - ""BUNTS"" -> B-U-N-T-S -> S is out.
  - ""DUNTS"" -> D-U-N-T-S -> S out.
  - ""HUNTS"" -> H-U-N-T-S -> S out.
  - ""LUNTS"" -> L-U-N-T-S -> S out.
  - ""PUNTS"" -> P-U-N-T-S -> S out.

  - ""WONT"" is 4 letters.

  - ""AUNTY"" -> but A is out and the pattern is not ...NT? A-U-N-T-Y -> that would be positions: 1:A, 2:U, 3:N, 4:T, 5:Y -> but A is out.

  - ""UNTIL"" -> U-N-T-I-L -> but that has N at position 2 and T at position 3? Not matching (we need N at 3 and T at 4).

  - ""ANTIC"" -> A is out and pattern not matching.

  - ""ENTER"" -> E is out.

  - ""ONTO"" is 4 letters.

  - ""ONTIC"" -> O-N-T-I-C -> but that has N at 2 and T at 3? Not matching.

We need to find words that have N at 3 and T at 4.

Let me search for words that have ""NT"" in the middle and then a fifth letter? Actually, the pattern is fixed: the third letter is N and the fourth is T, so the substring from position 3 to 4 is ""NT"".

So we are looking for words of the form: ?? + ""NT"" + ?

The word must be 5 letters: [letter1][letter2] N T [letter5]

We can use a word list or think of common words.

Another idea: ""BENT"" is 4 letters. 

What about ""BONUS""? -> B-O-N-U-S -> but that has N at position 3, but then the fourth letter is U, not T. So no.

""POINT"" is the classic, but we can't use it because of I.

""JOINT"" -> same issue with I? Actually, ""JOINT"" has I at position 3? J-O-I-N-T -> no, that's J(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). But we need N at 3 and T at 4. So that doesn't match.

We need N at 3 and T at 4.

Let me think: 
  ""COUNT"" has: C(1), O(2), U(3)? No: C(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), T(5) -> that's N at 4 and T at 5, not what we need.

We need N at position 3 and T at position 4.

So the word has:
  position 1: ?
  position 2: ?
  position 3: N
  position 4: T
  position 5: ?

So the word ends with ""T"" at position 4? Then position 5 is the last letter.

Examples: 
  ""ANTE"" is 4 letters.

  ""NUT"" is 3.

  ""MINTS"" we already tried, which is M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> but S is out.

  But we need a word without S at the end.

  ""MINTY"" -> M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but M and I are out.

  ""PANTY"" -> P(1), A(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5) -> A is out.

  ""WONT"" is 4 letters.

  ""DONUT"" -> D(1), O(2), N(3), U(4), T(5) -> that's N at 3, but T at 5, not at 4. So the fourth letter is U.

  We need T at 4.

  ""DONUT"" is D-O-N-U-T -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:N, 4:U, 5:T -> so T is at 5, not 4.

  ""TONIC"" -> T(1), O(2), N(3), I(4), C(5) -> I and C are out.

  ""CONIC"" -> C and I out.

  ""IONIC"" -> I and C out.

  ""SONIC"" -> S and I and C out.

  ""TONGS"" -> T(1), O(2), N(3), G(4), S(5) -> S is out.

  ""TANGY"" -> T(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5) -> A is out.

  ""BINGO"" -> B(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), O(5) -> I is out and the fourth letter is G, not T.

  ""BINGO"" doesn't have T.

  ""LINGO"" -> L(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), O(5) -> I out.

  ""MONTH"" -> M(1), O(2), N(3), T(4), H(5) -> M is out, but H is allowed? Let's see: M is out, so we can't use M.

  ""MONTH"" is not allowed because of M.

  ""Ninth"" -> N(1), I(2), N(3) -> wait, that's not 5 letters? ""NINTH"" is N-I-N-T-H -> positions: 1:N, 2:I, 3:N, 4:T, 5:H -> but I is out and also we have two N's? But we don't know if the word has two N's. However, I is out, so not allowed.

  ""BENCH"" -> E is out.

  ""LUNCH"" -> U is allowed, but the pattern: L(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5) -> but C is out.

  ""PUNCH"" -> same issue with C.

  ""HUNCH"" -> same.

  ""BUNCH"" -> same.

  ""DUNCE"" -> E is out.

  ""FUNKY"" -> F(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5) -> but we need T at position 4, but here it's K. So not matching.

  We need the fourth letter to be T.

  ""FUNKY"" has K at 4.

  ""PUNKY"" -> same.

  ""JUNTA"" -> J(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), A(5) -> A is out.

  ""JUNTO"" -> J(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), O(5) -> this fits the pattern: positions 3:N, 4:T, and the letters are J, U, N, T, O.

  But J is not a very common letter, and we haven't tried J. But it is allowed because it's not in the forbidden list.

  However, we want to test common letters. But we are constrained.

  ""JUNTO"" is a word meaning a political group.

  But let's see if there are better options.

  ""HUNTS"" is out because of S.

  ""PUNTO"" -> P(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), O(5) -> this is a valid word (meaning a point in fencing or a punctuation mark). And it uses P, U, O which are common.

  So ""PUNTO"" has:
      P: not tried (allowed)
      U: not tried (vowel)
      N: already known and in position 3 (which is correct, so we expect a ✓ for N and T)
      T: already known and in position 4 (✓)
      O: not tried

  This seems good because it tests P, U, and O.

  We can also consider ""BUNTO"" but I'm not sure if it's a word.

  ""BUNTO"" is not a common word.

  ""DONUT"" doesn't have T at 4.

  So ""PUNTO"" is a valid option.

  Another option: ""COUNT"" is out because of C.

  ""MOUNT"" is out because of M.

  ""VAUNT"" is out because of A.

  So ""PUNTO"" seems like a good guess.

  We can also consider ""WONT"" but it's 4 letters.

  Or ""WONTS"" -> but S is out.

  ""ONTIC"" is not matching.

  So I think ""PUNTO"" is a reasonable guess.

  We'll guess ""PUNTO"" to test P, U, and O.

  If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

  The expected feedback for N and T should be ✓ because we know they are in the correct positions.

  But we are testing the other letters.

  So let's go with ""PUNTO"".

  Format: <guess>punto</guess>

But wait, let's double-check the pattern: 
  P U N T O -> positions: 1:P, 2:U, 3:N, 4:T, 5:O -> yes, N at 3 and T at 4.

And the letters P, U, O are not forbidden.

So this is valid.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, R, A, E are not in the word. N is in the word but not in position 4.
- **Guess 2 (MINTS)**: M, I, S are not in the word. N is correct and in position 3. T is correct and in position 4.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ N T _` (N in position 3, T in position 4).
- Excluded letters: **C, R, A, E, M, I, S** (cannot appear in the word).
- Remaining vowels to test: **O, U**.
- Remaining common consonants to test: **B, D, G, H, L, P, Y**.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Focus on the unknown positions (1, 2, and 5) while testing new high-frequency letters.
- Prioritize words that fit the `_ _ N T _` pattern and include untested letters like **O, U, P, L, D**.
- Avoid reused letters and excluded letters.

After evaluating possible words (e.g., ""POINT"" invalid due to I, ""COUNT"" invalid due to C, ""MONTH"" invalid due to M), **PUNTO** is a strong choice:
- **P**: Untested common consonant.
- **U**: Untested vowel.
- **N**: Already confirmed in position 3 (expected ✓).
- **T**: Already confirmed in position 4 (expected ✓).
- **O**: Untested vowel.

This guess efficiently tests new letters (P, U, O) while respecting the known constraints and pattern.

And it does not contain C, R, A, E.\n\n We must choose a new 5-letter word that:\n 1. Does not contain C, R, A, E.\n 2. Contains the letter N (but not in the 4th position? Actually, it can be in any position except the 4th? But note: the feedback for N was a \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So in the new word, we can try N in a different position to see where it might be).\n\n However, note that the feedback only tells us that N is in the word and not in the 4th position. It might be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\n Also, we have eliminated 4 letters: C, R, A, E.\n\n We need to pick a word that uses other common letters and includes N.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that are left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We also know the word must have an N.\n\n We can try to pick a word that has N and other common letters to get more information.\n\n Some good starting letters: S, T, L, O, etc.\n\n Example words: \n   ""POINT"" - but O and I are vowels, and we haven\'t tested O or I yet? Actually, we haven\'t tested O, I, etc.\n\n However, note: we must avoid the letters C, R, A, E.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has N and other common letters we haven\'t tried.\n\n Possibilities: \n   ""LIONS"" -> but S is common, but note: we have 5 letters and we can use this to test multiple new letters.\n\n But wait: the word must be 5 letters and valid.\n\n However, we must also consider that the N must not be in the 4th position? Actually, in the new word we can put N in any position because we don\'t know the correct position yet. We are trying to find where N goes.\n\n But note: the feedback only said that in the first guess (position 4) it was wrong. So we can try N in a different position.\n\n Let me think of words that have N and avoid C, R, A, E.\n\n Some words:\n   ""POINT"" -> P, O, I, N, T -> none of these are in the forbidden list? \n        P: not forbidden, O: not forbidden, I: not forbidden, N: we know is in the word, T: not forbidden.\n\n   But note: we are not sure if O, I, T are in the word. We are trying to test multiple letters.\n\n   Alternatively, we could use a word that has N and also other common consonants and vowels we haven\'t tested.\n\n   Another idea: we know the word has N, so we can try to put N in a different position to see if we can get a ✓.\n\n   However, we have 6 tries, so we can also try to get more information about other letters.\n\n   Let me list the letters we haven\'t tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n   We want to test as many of the common ones as possible.\n\n   Common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n\n   So, a word like ""POINT"" would test P, O, I, N, T. That\'s 5 new letters.\n\n   But note: we already know N is in the word, so we are really testing P, O, I, T and the position of N.\n\n   Alternatively, we could use ""SLING"" -> S, L, I, N, G. But that has N in the 4th position? In ""SLING"": S(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). But we know that N is not in the 4th position? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess (where N was in the 4th position) it was not correct. But it might be that the word has N in the 4th position? Wait, no: the feedback for the first guess was that N is in the word but not in the 4th position. So the secret word has an N, but not at position 4. Therefore, in the new word, we should avoid putting N at position 4? Actually, we can put it at 4 again? But that would be a waste because we already know it\'s not there. So we should try a different position.\n\n   Therefore, in the new guess, we should put N in a position that is not 4. So positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\n   So ""POINT"" has N in the 4th position? \n        P-O-I-N-T: positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> so N is at 4. We should avoid that.\n\n   We need a word that has N but not at position 4.\n\n   How about ""NOISY""? \n        N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), Y(5) -> N is at 1. This is good because we are testing N at position 1.\n\n   But note: we are also testing O, I, S, Y. And we avoid the forbidden letters.\n\n   Another word: ""JOINT"" -> J is not very common, and we might not want to use a J.\n\n   Another: ""MINTY"" -> M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5) -> N is at 3.\n\n   Or ""TUNIC"" -> but C is forbidden.\n\n   We must avoid C, R, A, E.\n\n   Let me think of words with N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\n   Position 1: ""NOISE"", ""NOTES"" -> but E is forbidden? ""NOTES"" has E -> forbidden.\n\n   Position 1 without E: ""NOISY"", ""NOUNS"" (but double N? we don\'t know if the word has two Ns, but we can try). However, we are only required to have one N? Actually, the feedback for the first guess only said there is at least one N.\n\n   But note: if the word has two Ns, then we might get multiple \'-\' or one \'✓\' and one \'x\'? It\'s possible.\n\n   However, we are trying to get maximum information. So we should avoid repeating letters if possible? Because if we use a word with two Ns, we are only testing one new letter (the other N we already know). So it\'s better to have distinct letters.\n\n   So ""NOISY"": N, O, I, S, Y -> all distinct and none of these are forbidden.\n\n   Similarly, ""MINTY"": M, I, N, T, Y -> distinct.\n\n   But ""MINTY"" has N at position 3.\n\n   Which one to choose? \n\n   We can also consider the frequency of letters. Common letters: S, T, L, N (we already know N), O, I, etc.\n\n   ""NOISY"" has S and Y, which are common? S is very common.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a word that has T and S, which are very common.\n\n   How about ""POINT"" but we can\'t because N is at 4.\n\n   How about ""POINT"" with N moved? We can\'t change the word arbitrarily.\n\n   Another word: ""STING"" -> S(1), T(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> N at 4 again -> avoid.\n\n   How about ""SUNNY"" -> double N? and U is new, but we are repeating N -> not ideal.\n\n   Let me try to find a word with N at position 2: \n        e.g., ""SNOUT"" -> S(1), N(2), O(3), U(4), T(5) -> but U is less common? and we avoid forbidden letters? S, N, O, U, T: none are forbidden.\n\n   But U is a vowel and we haven\'t tested it.\n\n   Another: ""INBOX"" -> I(1), N(2), B(3), O(4), X(5) -> but X is rare.\n\n   Another: ""UNTIL"" -> U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), L(5) -> but U is at the start? and we have U and I.\n\n   We want to maximize the chance of hitting the correct letters.\n\n   After some thought, I think ""NOISY"" is a good candidate because:\n     - It has N at position 1 (which we haven\'t tried)\n     - It tests O, I, S, Y which are common enough.\n\n   But note: we are also testing the letter Y, which is less common than T, for example.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use ""TUNIS"" -> T(1), U(2), N(3), I(4), S(5) -> N at position 3. This tests T, U, N, I, S. T and S are very common.\n\n   However, ""TUNIS"" is a proper noun? We need a valid English word. ""Tunis"" is the capital of Tunisia, but it might be accepted? But in Wordle, proper nouns are usually not allowed. So we should avoid.\n\n   How about ""POINT"" but without the 4th position for N? We can\'t.\n\n   Another word: ""JOINS"" -> J is not common, and we might avoid.\n\n   Another: ""MINTS"" -> M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> N at 3, and T and S are common. Also, M and I are common.\n\n   But note: T is at position 4 and S at 5. This seems good.\n\n   ""MINTS"" uses M, I, N, T, S. All distinct and common.\n\n   We know N is in the word, so we are testing M, I, T, S and the position of N (at 3).\n\n   This seems better than ""NOISY"" because it tests T and S which are more common than Y.\n\n   So I\'ll go with ""MINTS"".\n\n   But wait: the feedback for the first guess said that N is in the word but not at position 4. In ""MINTS"", N is at position 3, which is different. So that\'s good.\n\n   Therefore, my second guess is ""MINTS"".\n\n   We\'ll see the feedback and then adjust.\n\n   So the word is ""MINTS"".\n\n   Let me write it in the required format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, E not in the word; N is in the word but not in position 4), I need to choose a new word that:\n- Excludes C, R, A, E\n- Includes N (in a position other than 4 to test new locations)\n- Tests new common letters to gather more information\n\nI considered words like ""NOISY"" and ""MINTY"" but settled on **""MINTS""** because:\n- It places N in position 3 (a new position to check)\n- It tests four new common letters: M, I, T, S\n- All letters are distinct and high-frequency\n- It avoids reused positions for N\n\nThis guess maximizes information by covering frequent consonants (M, T, S) and a vowel (I), while respecting the constraints.\n\n<guess>mints</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: mints -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(✓) T(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)\nMeaning:\n  C, R, A, E are not in the word.\n  N is in the word but not in position 4.\n\nGuess 2: ""mints"" -> M(x), I(x), N(✓), T(✓), S(x)\nMeaning:\n  M, I, S are not in the word.\n  N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, because in ""mints"", N is the third letter).\n  T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, because in ""mints"", T is the fourth letter).\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n\n- The secret word has the letter N in the third position and T in the fourth position.\n- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, E, M, I, S.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we know that N is not in position 4 (which we now know is correct because T is in position 4) and that the word has an N (which we now know is at position 3).\n\nSo the secret word has the form: _ _ N T _\n\nWe need to fill in the first, second, and fifth positions.\n\nWe also know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, M, I, S.\n\nWe can list the available letters (consonants and vowels) that we haven\'t tried:\n\nVowels left: O, U (since A, E, I are out)\nConsonants left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, V, W, X, Y, Z (C, R, M, S are out)\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word of the form _ _ N T _\n\nWe can think of words that end with ""NT"", but note the third letter is fixed as N and fourth as T, so the last part is ""NT"" and then the fifth letter.\n\nCommon patterns: words like ""COUNT"", ""POINT"", but note:\n  - ""POINT"" has P, O, I, N, T -> but I is out (from guess2: I(x)), so not possible.\n  - ""COUNT"" has C, O, U, N, T -> but C is out (from guess1: C(x)).\n\nWe need to avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nPossible words: \n  The fifth letter can be a vowel (O, U) or a consonant.\n\nLet\'s list possible words that fit the pattern and use only the available letters.\n\nWe have two positions: first and second, and fifth.\n\nWe can try to use a word that tests common letters for the first, second, and fifth positions.\n\nAvailable common letters: O, U, L, P, D, B, G, H, etc.\n\nWe can try ""HUNT"" but that\'s 4 letters. We need 5.\n\n5-letter words: \n  ...N T _ \n\nExamples:\n  - ""POINT"" -> not possible (I and C? Actually, P is allowed, but I is not. So no).\n  - ""COUNT"" -> C is not allowed.\n  - ""MOUNT"" -> M is not allowed (from guess2: M(x)).\n  - ""VAUNT"" -> V is allowed? Let\'s check: V, A -> but A is not allowed (from guess1: A(x)).\n  - ""DAUNT"" -> D, A -> A not allowed.\n  - ""GAUNT"" -> G, A -> A not allowed.\n  - ""HAUNT"" -> H, A -> A not allowed.\n  - ""JAUNT"" -> J, A -> A not allowed and J is not common.\n\nWhat about words that don\'t have A? \n\n  - ""BUNTS"" -> B, U, N, T, S -> but S is not allowed (from guess2: S(x)).\n  - ""DUNTS"" -> D, U, N, T, S -> S not allowed.\n  - ""HUNTS"" -> H, U, N, T, S -> S not allowed.\n  - ""PUNTS"" -> P, U, N, T, S -> S not allowed.\n\nWe need the fifth letter to not be S and not any of the forbidden letters.\n\nWhat about words ending with ""NT"" and then a vowel? But the fifth letter must be a consonant? Not necessarily, it can be a vowel? Actually, the word must be 5 letters.\n\nLet me think of words: \n  ""FRONT"" -> F, R, O, N, T -> but R is not allowed (from guess1: R(x)).\n  ""GRANT"" -> G, R, A, N, T -> R and A not allowed.\n  ""PRINT"" -> P, R, I, N, T -> R and I not allowed.\n\nWe are having trouble. Maybe we need to consider that the fifth letter might be a vowel? But the pattern is _ _ N T _ , so the last letter is the fifth.\n\nWords that end with ""T"" and the fifth letter is a vowel? Actually, no, because the fourth is T and fifth is separate.\n\nFor example, ""POINT"" ends with T? No, it ends with T? Actually, ""POINT"" is P-O-I-N-T, so the fifth letter is T? But in our pattern, the fourth is T, so the fifth is after T? That would be words that have a letter after T? \n\nBut our pattern is: position 3: N, position 4: T, so position 5: some letter.\n\nSo the word ends with ""NT"" and then one more letter? Actually, no: the word has five letters: \n  position1: ?\n  position2: ?\n  position3: N\n  position4: T\n  position5: ?\n\nSo the word is: ? ? N T ?\n\nWe need a word that has the third letter N and fourth letter T.\n\nExamples of such words in English:\n\n  - ""COUNT"" -> C-O-U-N-T -> but C is out.\n  - ""MOUNT"" -> M-O-U-N-T -> M is out.\n  - ""POINT"" -> P-O-I-N-T -> I is out.\n  - ""JAUNT"" -> J-A-U-N-T -> A is out and J is not common.\n  - ""HAUNT"" -> H-A-U-N-T -> A is out.\n  - ""GAUNT"" -> G-A-U-N-T -> A out.\n  - ""DAUNT"" -> D-A-U-N-T -> A out.\n  - ""VAUNT"" -> V-A-U-N-T -> A out.\n\n  - ""BUNTS"" -> B-U-N-T-S -> S is out.\n  - ""DUNTS"" -> D-U-N-T-S -> S out.\n  - ""HUNTS"" -> H-U-N-T-S -> S out.\n  - ""LUNTS"" -> L-U-N-T-S -> S out.\n  - ""PUNTS"" -> P-U-N-T-S -> S out.\n\n  - ""WONT"" is 4 letters.\n\n  - ""AUNTY"" -> but A is out and the pattern is not ...NT? A-U-N-T-Y -> that would be positions: 1:A, 2:U, 3:N, 4:T, 5:Y -> but A is out.\n\n  - ""UNTIL"" -> U-N-T-I-L -> but that has N at position 2 and T at position 3? Not matching (we need N at 3 and T at 4).\n\n  - ""ANTIC"" -> A is out and pattern not matching.\n\n  - ""ENTER"" -> E is out.\n\n  - ""ONTO"" is 4 letters.\n\n  - ""ONTIC"" -> O-N-T-I-C -> but that has N at 2 and T at 3? Not matching.\n\nWe need to find words that have N at 3 and T at 4.\n\nLet me search for words that have ""NT"" in the middle and then a fifth letter? Actually, the pattern is fixed: the third letter is N and the fourth is T, so the substring from position 3 to 4 is ""NT"".\n\nSo we are looking for words of the form: ?? + ""NT"" + ?\n\nThe word must be 5 letters: [letter1][letter2] N T [letter5]\n\nWe can use a word list or think of common words.\n\nAnother idea: ""BENT"" is 4 letters. \n\nWhat about ""BONUS""? -> B-O-N-U-S -> but that has N at position 3, but then the fourth letter is U, not T. So no.\n\n""POINT"" is the classic, but we can\'t use it because of I.\n\n""JOINT"" -> same issue with I? Actually, ""JOINT"" has I at position 3? J-O-I-N-T -> no, that\'s J(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). But we need N at 3 and T at 4. So that doesn\'t match.\n\nWe need N at 3 and T at 4.\n\nLet me think: \n  ""COUNT"" has: C(1), O(2), U(3)? No: C(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), T(5) -> that\'s N at 4 and T at 5, not what we need.\n\nWe need N at position 3 and T at position 4.\n\nSo the word has:\n  position 1: ?\n  position 2: ?\n  position 3: N\n  position 4: T\n  position 5: ?\n\nSo the word ends with ""T"" at position 4? Then position 5 is the last letter.\n\nExamples: \n  ""ANTE"" is 4 letters.\n\n  ""NUT"" is 3.\n\n  ""MINTS"" we already tried, which is M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> but S is out.\n\n  But we need a word without S at the end.\n\n  ""MINTY"" -> M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but M and I are out.\n\n  ""PANTY"" -> P(1), A(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5) -> A is out.\n\n  ""WONT"" is 4 letters.\n\n  ""DONUT"" -> D(1), O(2), N(3), U(4), T(5) -> that\'s N at 3, but T at 5, not at 4. So the fourth letter is U.\n\n  We need T at 4.\n\n  ""DONUT"" is D-O-N-U-T -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:N, 4:U, 5:T -> so T is at 5, not 4.\n\n  ""TONIC"" -> T(1), O(2), N(3), I(4), C(5) -> I and C are out.\n\n  ""CONIC"" -> C and I out.\n\n  ""IONIC"" -> I and C out.\n\n  ""SONIC"" -> S and I and C out.\n\n  ""TONGS"" -> T(1), O(2), N(3), G(4), S(5) -> S is out.\n\n  ""TANGY"" -> T(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5) -> A is out.\n\n  ""BINGO"" -> B(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), O(5) -> I is out and the fourth letter is G, not T.\n\n  ""BINGO"" doesn\'t have T.\n\n  ""LINGO"" -> L(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), O(5) -> I out.\n\n  ""MONTH"" -> M(1), O(2), N(3), T(4), H(5) -> M is out, but H is allowed? Let\'s see: M is out, so we can\'t use M.\n\n  ""MONTH"" is not allowed because of M.\n\n  ""Ninth"" -> N(1), I(2), N(3) -> wait, that\'s not 5 letters? ""NINTH"" is N-I-N-T-H -> positions: 1:N, 2:I, 3:N, 4:T, 5:H -> but I is out and also we have two N\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two N\'s. However, I is out, so not allowed.\n\n  ""BENCH"" -> E is out.\n\n  ""LUNCH"" -> U is allowed, but the pattern: L(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5) -> but C is out.\n\n  ""PUNCH"" -> same issue with C.\n\n  ""HUNCH"" -> same.\n\n  ""BUNCH"" -> same.\n\n  ""DUNCE"" -> E is out.\n\n  ""FUNKY"" -> F(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5) -> but we need T at position 4, but here it\'s K. So not matching.\n\n  We need the fourth letter to be T.\n\n  ""FUNKY"" has K at 4.\n\n  ""PUNKY"" -> same.\n\n  ""JUNTA"" -> J(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), A(5) -> A is out.\n\n  ""JUNTO"" -> J(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), O(5) -> this fits the pattern: positions 3:N, 4:T, and the letters are J, U, N, T, O.\n\n  But J is not a very common letter, and we haven\'t tried J. But it is allowed because it\'s not in the forbidden list.\n\n  However, we want to test common letters. But we are constrained.\n\n  ""JUNTO"" is a word meaning a political group.\n\n  But let\'s see if there are better options.\n\n  ""HUNTS"" is out because of S.\n\n  ""PUNTO"" -> P(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), O(5) -> this is a valid word (meaning a point in fencing or a punctuation mark).

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Meaning: C, R, A, E are not in the word. N is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 2: ""mints"" -> M(x), I(x), N(✓), T(✓), S(x)
Meaning: M, I, S are not in the word. N is in the correct position (position 3). T is in the correct position (position 4).

Guess 3: ""punto"" -> P(x), U(✓), N(✓), T(✓), O(✓)
Meaning: P is not in the word. U, N, T, O are in the word and in the correct positions.

From Guess 3, we see that U is in the correct position (position 2, because in ""punto"", U is the second letter) and O is in the correct position (position 5). Also, N and T are confirmed again in positions 3 and 4.

So, putting it all together:

- The secret word has the form: _ U N T O
  - Position 2: U
  - Position 3: N
  - Position 4: T
  - Position 5: O

We only need to find the first letter.

The word is: [letter1] U N T O

We know the following letters are not in the word (from all feedback):
- From guess1: C, R, A, E
- From guess2: M, I, S
- From guess3: P

Also, we know that the first letter cannot be any of these: C, R, A, E, M, I, S, P.

We also know that the first letter must be a letter that hasn't been tried yet and is not in the forbidden list.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form [letter] U N T O.

What are possible words?

Common words: 
  ""AUNTO"" -> but A is out.
  ""BUNTO"" -> not a common word? Let me check: ""bunto"" is not a standard English word.
  ""DUNTO"" -> not a word.
  ""HUNTO"" -> not a word.
  ""LUNTO"" -> not a word.

But we have ""JUNTO"" -> which is a word (a political group). And J is allowed.

Also, ""JUNTO"" fits: J(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), O(5).

But we haven't tried J. Is there any other word?

Another possibility: ""BUNTO"" might be accepted in some dictionaries? But I think ""JUNTO"" is more common.

But let's see if there are other options.

""COUNT"" is 5 letters but C is out and it doesn't fit the pattern (we have U at 2, but ""COUNT"" is C-O-U-N-T, so O at 2, not U).

We need U at position 2.

Another word: ""DUNNO"" -> D-U-N-N-O -> but that has two N's? And it's an informal word for ""don't know"". Also, the pattern: D(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), O(5) -> but we need T at position 4, not N. So no.

""FUNGO"" -> F-U-N-G-O -> but that has G at 4, not T.

We need T at 4.

So the only common word I can think of is ""JUNTO"".

But let's confirm: 
  ""JUNTO"": J, U, N, T, O -> positions: 1:J, 2:U, 3:N, 4:T, 5:O -> matches the pattern.

And J is not in the forbidden list.

Therefore, the secret word is likely ""JUNTO"".

But we have to make sure it's a valid guess. Since we are in a game, and ""JUNTO"" is a valid English word, we can guess it.

We have 6 tries, and this is our fourth guess.

So we can guess ""JUNTO"".

But note: we are not 100% sure because there might be other words? However, with the constraints, I don't see any other common words.

What about ""AUNTO""? A is out.

""BUNTO"": not a word.

""TUNTO"": not a word.

""WUNTO"": not a word.

""YUNTO"": not a word.

So ""JUNTO"" is the only common word that fits.

Therefore, we guess ""JUNTO"".

But let's see the feedback we expect: 
  J: we don't know, but if it's correct, we get ✓. If not, we get x. But if it's not, then we have to try another word? But we don't have many options.

Alternatively, we could use a word that tests multiple possibilities for the first letter? But we only have one letter to guess, and we have to fill the first position.

But we don't have any other information. We must guess a word that fits the pattern.

Since we have to make a guess, and ""JUNTO"" is the only common word, we go with that.

If it's not, then we might have to consider rare words, but let's hope it is.

So the guess is ""JUNTO"".

But note: in the feedback for guess3, we have U, N, T, O all correct, so the only unknown is the first letter.

So we can also consider that the first letter might be a letter that we haven't tried, and we can guess it directly.

But we don't have a word that tests multiple because we only have one position left.

So I think ""JUNTO"" is the best guess.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1 (CRANE)**:
   - C, R, A, E: Not in the word (`x`).
   - N: In the word but wrong position (`-`).

2. **Guess 2 (MINTS)**:
   - M, I, S: Not in the word (`x`).
   - N: Correct position (position 3, `✓`).
   - T: Correct position (position 4, `✓`).

3. **Guess 3 (PUNTO)**:
   - P: Not in the word (`x`).
   - U: Correct position (position 2, `✓`).
   - N: Correct position (position 3, `✓`).
   - T: Correct position (position 4, `✓`).
   - O: Correct position (position 5, `✓`).

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ U N T O` (positions 2–5 confirmed: U, N, T, O).
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, E, M, I, S, P (cannot appear).
- **Remaining unknown**: Only **position 1** needs to be solved.
- **Possible letters for position 1**: Untried consonants like B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, V, W, Y, Z (since vowels A, E, I, O, U are either excluded or already placed).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- The only unknown is position 1. We need a valid 5-letter word of the form `[letter] U N T O`.
- **""JUNTO""** is the **only common English word** fitting this pattern:
  - J (position 1, untested letter),
  - U (✓ position 2),
  - N (✓ position 3),
  - T (✓ position 4),
  - O (✓ position 5).
- ""JUNTO"" (meaning a political group) uses `J`—a plausible consonant not yet tested—and adheres to all constraints.
