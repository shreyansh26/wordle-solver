We are given feedback from the first guess: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
 This means:
 - C is not in the word (x)
 - R is in the word but not in the second position (-)
 - A is in the word but not in the third position (-)
 - N is not in the word (x)
 - E is not in the word (x)

 So, we know:
 - The word contains R and A, but not C, N, or E.
 - R is not in position 2, and A is not in position 3.

 Now, we must choose a second guess that meets the following:
 - Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
 - Should use the knowledge we have: avoid C, N, E and include R and A, but not in the forbidden positions.

 Let's think about possible positions for R and A:
 - Since R cannot be in position 2, it can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 - Similarly, A cannot be in position 3, so it can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We also need to avoid the letters C, N, E.

 Given that, let's try to form a new word that includes R and A, and three other new letters (since we don't want to waste guesses on letters we know are absent).

 Common vowels besides A and E include I, O, U. Since E is out, we might use I or O. Also, common consonants that are not C or N: for example, T, S, L, etc.

 We should also try to test new letters to get more information.

 A good strategy might be to try a word that has R in a different position and A in a different position, and includes three new letters.

 Let me list some possibilities:

 We know R must be placed in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 and A in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Example words:
 - We might try a word with R in position 1 and A in position 2? But that leaves three more positions and we avoid C,N,E.
   Example: ""RADIO"" -> but D and I and O are new, and we don't know if they are in the word.

 However, note that we have only two known letters to include (R and A). We want to maximize new information.

 We could also try to include more common letters. In Wordle, common consonants include T, S, L, P, M, etc.

 Another idea: try a word that puts R in position 4 or 5 and A in position 1 or 2? But that might be too restrictive.

 Let me brainstorm:

 Possibility: Start with R? Then the word would be R????. Since A is available, put it in the second position? But we don't know if that's allowed. However, note the second position might be allowed for A? Actually, A can go in position 2 because the feedback only forbade position 3. So let's consider:

 - ""RAILS"": This would be R in 1 (new position) and A in 2 (which is allowed) and then I, L, S. But note: we have two letters R and A, and three new (I,L,S). However, ""RAILS"" has R in position 1 and A in position 2? Then the feedback for R would be ✓ if R is in the correct position? We don't know yet.

 However, we must be cautious: what if R is not in position 1? We don't know. We have to test.

 Alternatively, we can avoid putting R in position 2 (since last time R was in position 2 and was wrong) and avoid A in position 3.

 Since we have two letters that we know are present, we might choose a word that has these two and try different positions.

 Considering common letters: T, S, L, etc.

 Let me try a word that has R and A and also includes T and S? That way we cover more common letters.

 Example: ""STARS"": 
 - S at position 1, T at 2, A at 3, R at 4, S at 5? But wait, we have A at position 3 which is forbidden? So no, because feedback said A is not in position 3.

 We must avoid putting A in position 3.

 So, ""STARS"" has A in position 3 -> not allowed.

 What about ""TRAIL""? 
 - Positions: T, R, A, I, L.
 - Here, R is in position 2? But the previous guess had R in position 2 and it was marked wrong. So we know R cannot be in position 2? Therefore, TRAIL has R at position 2 -> not good.

 Let me think: we need R in a position that is not 2. So let's have positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5.

 Similarly, we want A to be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Possibilities:

 Option: R at position 1, A at position 4? 
 Example: ""ROTAL"" (which is not common) or ""RADIO"" (A at position 2, not 3) -> but R at position 1: ""RADIO"" -> R in 1, A in 2 (allowed because A can be in 2).

 But note: We also want to test other common letters.

 Another idea: ""PARTS"": 
 - P, A, R, T, S -> A in position 2? But then R in position 3? Because: P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5). 
   For A: position 2 is allowed (since forbidden only for position 3) and for R: position 3 is allowed? But wait, we don't know if position 3 is correct, but it's a possible position because last time R was in position 2 and was wrong, but could be 1,3,4,5.

 However, let's check if ""PARTS"" is valid. Yes, it is a word.

 But what about the letters? P is new, A at 2 (allowed), R at 3 (which we don't know, but we are testing), T and S new.

 Alternatively, ""ARTSY"" -> A at 1, R at 2 -> but R must not be at position 2 because we already tried R at position 2 and it was wrong? So invalid.

 Therefore, R at position 2 is forbidden. So we cannot have R at position 2.

 In ""PARTS"": R is at position 3 -> allowed? Yes.

 Also, A is at position 2 -> which is not position 3, so allowed.

 But wait: what if A was actually in position 2? Then we might get a match? That's okay because we are testing.

 Alternatively, let me consider ""SAVOR"": 
 - S(1), A(2), V(3), O(4), R(5). This places A at position 2 and R at position 5.

 This avoids putting R in a position we know it wasn't (position 2) and avoids A in position 3.

 The letters S, V, O are new. 

 However, we have two known present letters (A and R) and three new (S,V,O). Also common letters: S and O are common.

 Another common word: ""ROAST"" -> but we cannot because E is in ROAST? No, ROAST has O,A,S,T,R -> R at 1, O at 2? But note, O is new? Remember we only know about C,N,E being absent. Also, check: ROAST has R(1), O(2), A(3), S(4), T(5). But A is at position 3? Which is the forbidden position? So that's not allowed.

 Therefore, no A at position 3.

 After considering, I think ""PARTS"" is acceptable: 
 Positions: 
 - P (letter not tested)
 - A (in position 2, which is allowed)
 - R (in position 3, not 2 -> allowed)
 - T (new)
 - S (new)

 Another option: ""TARPS"": 
 - T(1), A(2), R(3), P(4), S(5). Similar. 

 But ""PARTS"" is more common.

 However, note: we haven't tested T and S. So let's pick a word that includes T, S and avoids E and N.

 Also, we might consider ""RATIO"": 
 - R at 1, A at 2, T at 3, I at 4, O at 5 -> Then R at position 1 (not 2) and A at 2 (allowed). But T, I, O are new.

 But ""RATIO"" is a valid word.

 Which is better? ""PARTS"" or ""RATIO""? 

 Since we don't have any constraints on other letters, let me choose one that maximizes new letters coverage.

 We know we need to find the word. Both are valid.

 I'll choose ""PARTS"" because it includes both S and T, which are common.

 Therefore, let me guess ""PARTS"".

 But again, check: 
 - We are avoiding C, N, E, which is done.
 - Includes A and R, which is required.
 - A is in position 2? That's okay.
 - R is in position 3? That's okay.

 Alternatively, let me double-check: what if the word actually has A in position 2 and R in position 3? Then we'd get some ✓.

 But regardless, we are testing.

 We might also consider that in our first guess, R was in position 2 and A in position 3? But now we are moving them.

 I think ""PARTS"" is a valid choice.

 Let's see other options: ""STAIR""? 
 - S(1), T(2), A(3) -> wait, A cannot be in position 3? So invalid.

 ""ALARM"": 
 - A(1), L(2), A(3) -> A is at position 3? So invalid? 
   Actually, the feedback said the letter A is in the word but not in position 3? Then in ""ALARM"", A is in position 1 and 3 -> but at position 3 it would be wrong? So that would be bad because we know A is present, but we must not put it in position 3? Actually, the rule says we get a '-' only if the letter is present and not in that position, and we might have multiple As? 

 The feedback for 'A' in the first guess (position 3) was '-', meaning that there is an A but not at position 3. This doesn't prevent A from being at other positions. And if there are two A's? Then we might have one at 3 and one elsewhere? Actually: the '-' for a letter only indicates that at least one instance is present and that particular instance is not in the correct position. But there could be multiple. However, if we put an A in position 3, we might get a '-' again (if there is another A) or even a ✓ if the second A is at position 3? Actually, the rule: the feedback is per letter in the guess. So if we put A in position 3 again, and the secret has an A in position 3, then we would get a ✓. But if not, we might get a '-' or even an 'x'? 

 But wait: the feedback for each position corresponds to the letter in that position. So if the secret has one A and it is at position 2, then if we guess a word with A at position 3, we would get an 'x' for that position? Or wait: no, because the '-' means the letter is in the word but not in that position? Actually, we must read the rules:

 Feedback for a letter in the guess:
 - ✓ : the letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
 - - : the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
 - x : the letter is NOT in the word.

 So if the secret word has exactly one A at position 2, then:
 - In position 2: A would get ✓.
 - In any other position: if we put A, it would get an 'x'? Because the secret has only one A? Or wait: the feedback marks the letter independent of duplicates? Actually, the standard rule: each letter in the guess is compared to the secret. For duplicates, it's a bit tricky.

 However, to avoid complication, we know that we must avoid putting R at position 2 and A at position 3? Why? Because the previous feedback said for position 2: R was present (so in the word) but not there. Similarly, A at position 3 was not there.

 But note: it doesn't preclude the possibility that R could be in position 2 if there are two R's? Actually, no: if the secret had two R's, one of which is in position 2, then when we guessed R at position 2 we would have gotten a ✓. Since we got a '-' for R at position 2, that means that position 2 is not R? So even if there are two R's, position 2 still cannot be R? 

 Actually, no: the '-' for R at position 2 means that the letter R is in the word, but that specific position (2) is not R. So if there are two R's, one in position 1 and one in position 3, then if we guess R at position 2, we get a '-' because there is an R in the word? But position 2 is wrong.

 However, we don't know the number of occurrences. We do know that position 2 is not R? Because if position 2 were R, we would have gotten a ✓? 

 So by deduction: the '-' means that the letter is in the word but NOT in that position. Therefore, we know that the specific position we guessed is NOT that letter? Similarly, for A at position 3: we know that position 3 is not A? 

 So we avoid putting R in position 2 and A in position 3? Yes.

 Therefore, we must avoid position 2 for R and position 3 for A.

 In ""PARTS"":
 - Position 2: A -> allowed because we can have A at position 2? The previous feedback only forbade position 3 for A? We haven't tested position 2 for A. Actually, we have tested position 3? Then A can be at 2? Yes.

 Let me check:

 First guess: crane -> position 2 is R? and position 3 is A? and we got R(-) and A(-). So we know:
   Position 2: not R? How does this affect position 2 for A? 
   Position 3: not A? How does this affect position 2 for R? 

 They are independent: we can have A at position 2? Yes, because the feedback for A said it was present but not at position 3? So position 2 is open? Similarly, we cannot have A at position 3? 

 So ""PARTS"" is valid: 
   P at position 1 (new)
   A at position 2: we don't know if it's correct? But we are going to test it? It's allowed and we'll get feedback.

 So I'll go with ""PARTS"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)):
- Letters C, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- Letters R and A **are** in the secret word, but:
  - R is not in position 2 (since it was marked as ""-"" in position 2 of ""crane"").
  - A is not in position 3.

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Include **R** and **A** (since they are part of the word).
2. Avoid C, N, E.
3. Place R anywhere **except position 2** (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
4. Place A anywhere **except position 3** (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
5. Introduce new letters to gather more information.

I chose **""parts""** because:
- It includes R (in position 3) and A (in position 2), avoiding forbidden positions.
- It introduces new common letters: P, T, S (which are frequent in English 5-letter words).
- It avoids C, N, E entirely.

This guess helps test the positions of R and A while probing three new consonants. If A is correctly placed in position 2 or R in position 3, the feedback will confirm it. Otherwise, it rules out more possibilities.

<guess>parts</guess>",parts,"We are given feedback from the first guess: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
 This means:
 - C is not in the word (x)
 - R is in the word but not in the second position (-)
 - A is in the word but not in the third position (-)
 - N is not in the word (x)
 - E is not in the word (x)

 So, we know:
 - The word contains R and A, but not C, N, or E.
 - R is not in position 2, and A is not in position 3.

 Now, we must choose a second guess that meets the following:
 - Must be a valid 5-letter English word.

 - Similarly, A cannot be in position 3, so it can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We also need to avoid the letters C, N, E.

 We must avoid putting A in position 3.

 So, ""STARS"" has A in position 3 -> not allowed.

 What about ""TRAIL""? 
 - Positions: T, R, A, I, L.
 - Here, R is in position 2? But the previous guess had R in position 2 and it was marked wrong. So we know R cannot be in position 2? Therefore, TRAIL has R at position 2 -> not good.

 Let me think: we need R in a position that is not 2. So let's have positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5.

 Similarly, we want A to be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Possibilities:

 Option: R at position 1, A at position 4? 
 Example: ""ROTAL"" (which is not common) or ""RADIO"" (A at position 2, not 3) -> but R at position 1: ""RADIO"" -> R in 1, A in 2 (allowed because A can be in 2).

 But note: We also want to test other common letters.

 Another idea: ""PARTS"": 
 - P, A, R, T, S -> A in position 2? But then R in position 3? Because: P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5). 
   For A: position 2 is allowed (since forbidden only for position 3) and for R: position 3 is allowed? But wait, we don't know if position 3 is correct, but it's a possible position because last time R was in position 2 and was wrong, but could be 1,3,4,5.

 Alternatively, ""ARTSY"" -> A at 1, R at 2 -> but R must not be at position 2 because we already tried R at position 2 and it was wrong? So invalid.

 Therefore, R at position 2 is forbidden. So we cannot have R at position 2.

 In ""PARTS"": R is at position 3 -> allowed? Yes.

 Also, A is at position 2 -> which is not position 3, so allowed.

 This avoids putting R in a position we know it wasn't (position 2) and avoids A in position 3.

 The letters S, V, O are new. 

 However, we have two known present letters (A and R) and three new (S,V,O). Also common letters: S and O are common.

 Another common word: ""ROAST"" -> but we cannot because E is in ROAST? No, ROAST has O,A,S,T,R -> R at 1, O at 2? But note, O is new? Remember we only know about C,N,E being absent. Also, check: ROAST has R(1), O(2), A(3), S(4), T(5). But A is at position 3? Which is the forbidden position? So that's not allowed.

 Therefore, no A at position 3.

 Positions: 
 - P (letter not tested)
 - A (in position 2, which is allowed)
 - R (in position 3, not 2 -> allowed)
 - T (new)
 - S (new)

 Another option: ""TARPS"": 
 - T(1), A(2), R(3), P(4), S(5). Similar. 

 But ""PARTS"" is more common.

 However, note: we haven't tested T and S. So let's pick a word that includes T, S and avoids E and N.

 Also, we might consider ""RATIO"": 
 - R at 1, A at 2, T at 3, I at 4, O at 5 -> Then R at position 1 (not 2) and A at 2 (allowed). But T, I, O are new.

 But ""RATIO"" is a valid word.

 Which is better? ""PARTS"" or ""RATIO""? 

 Since we don't have any constraints on other letters, let me choose one that maximizes new letters coverage.

 We know we need to find the word. Both are valid.

 I'll choose ""PARTS"" because it includes both S and T, which are common.

 Therefore, let me guess ""PARTS"".

 But again, check: 
 - We are avoiding C, N, E, which is done.
 - Includes A and R, which is required.
 - A is in position 2? That's okay.
 - R is in position 3? That's okay.

 Alternatively, let me double-check: what if the word actually has A in position 2 and R in position 3? Then we'd get some ✓.

 But regardless, we are testing.

 We might also consider that in our first guess, R was in position 2 and A in position 3? But now we are moving them.

 I think ""PARTS"" is a valid choice.

 Let's see other options: ""STAIR""? 
 - S(1), T(2), A(3) -> wait, A cannot be in position 3? So invalid.

 ""ALARM"": 
 - A(1), L(2), A(3) -> A is at position 3? So invalid? 
   Actually, the feedback said the letter A is in the word but not in position 3? Then in ""ALARM"", A is in position 1 and 3 -> but at position 3 it would be wrong? So that would be bad because we know A is present, but we must not put it in position 3? Actually, the rule says we get a '-' only if the letter is present and not in that position, and we might have multiple As? 

 The feedback for 'A' in the first guess (position 3) was '-', meaning that there is an A but not at position 3. This doesn't prevent A from being at other positions. And if there are two A's? Then we might have one at 3 and one elsewhere? Actually: the '-' for a letter only indicates that at least one instance is present and that particular instance is not in the correct position. But there could be multiple. However, if we put an A in position 3, we might get a '-' again (if there is another A) or even a ✓ if the second A is at position 3? Actually, the rule: the feedback is per letter in the guess. So if we put A in position 3 again, and the secret has an A in position 3, then we would get a ✓. But if not, we might get a '-' or even an 'x'? 

 But wait: the feedback for each position corresponds to the letter in that position. So if the secret has one A and it is at position 2, then if we guess a word with A at position 3, we would get an 'x' for that position? Or wait: no, because the '-' means the letter is in the word but not in that position? Actually, we must read the rules:

 Feedback for a letter in the guess:
 - ✓ : the letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
 - - : the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
 - x : the letter is NOT in the word.

 So if the secret word has exactly one A at position 2, then:
 - In position 2: A would get ✓.
 - In any other position: if we put A, it would get an 'x'? Because the secret has only one A? Or wait: the feedback marks the letter independent of duplicates? Actually, the standard rule: each letter in the guess is compared to the secret. For duplicates, it's a bit tricky.

 However, to avoid complication, we know that we must avoid putting R at position 2 and A at position 3? Why? Because the previous feedback said for position 2: R was present (so in the word) but not there. Similarly, A at position 3 was not there.

 But note: it doesn't preclude the possibility that R could be in position 2 if there are two R's? Actually, no: if the secret had two R's, one of which is in position 2, then when we guessed R at position 2 we would have gotten a ✓. Since we got a '-' for R at position 2, that means that position 2 is not R? So even if there are two R's, position 2 still cannot be R? 

 Actually, no: the '-' for R at position 2 means that the letter R is in the word, but that specific position (2) is not R. So if there are two R's, one in position 1 and one in position 3, then if we guess R at position 2, we get a '-' because there is an R in the word? But position 2 is wrong.

 However, we don't know the number of occurrences. We do know that position 2 is not R? Because if position 2 were R, we would have gotten a ✓? 

 So by deduction: the '-' means that the letter is in the word but NOT in that position. Therefore, we know that the specific position we guessed is NOT that letter? Similarly, for A at position 3: we know that position 3 is not A? 

 So we avoid putting R in position 2 and A in position 3? Yes.

 Therefore, we must avoid position 2 for R and position 3 for A.

 In ""PARTS"":
 - Position 2: A -> allowed because we can have A at position 2? The previous feedback only forbade position 3 for A? We haven't tested position 2 for A. Actually, we have tested position 3? Then A can be at 2? Yes.

 Let me check:

 First guess: crane -> position 2 is R? and position 3 is A? and we got R(-) and A(-). So we know:
   Position 2: not R? How does this affect position 2 for A? 
   Position 3: not A? How does this affect position 2 for R? 

 They are independent: we can have A at position 2? Yes, because the feedback for A said it was present but not at position 3? So position 2 is open? Similarly, we cannot have A at position 3? 

 So ""PARTS"" is valid: 
   P at position 1 (new)
   A at position 2: we don't know if it's correct? But we are going to test it? It's allowed and we'll get feedback.

 So I'll go with ""PARTS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)):
- Letters C, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- Letters R and A **are** in the secret word, but:
  - R is not in position 2 (since it was marked as ""-"" in position 2 of ""crane"").
  - A is not in position 3.

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Include **R** and **A** (since they are part of the word).
2. Avoid C, N, E.
3. Place R anywhere **except position 2** (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
4. Place A anywhere **except position 3** (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
5. Introduce new letters to gather more information.

I chose **""parts""** because:
- It includes R (in position 3) and A (in position 2), avoiding forbidden positions.
- It introduces new common letters: P, T, S (which are frequent in English 5-letter words).
- It avoids C, N, E entirely.

This guess helps test the positions of R and A while probing three new consonants. If A is correctly placed in position 2 or R in position 3, the feedback will confirm it. Otherwise, it rules out more possibilities.",Guess 2: parts -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) S(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
 This means:
 - C is not in the word (x)
 - R is in the word but not in the second position (-)
 - A is in the word but not in the third position (-)
 - N is not in the word (x)
 - E is not in the word (x)

 So, we know:
 - The word contains R and A, but not C, N, or E.
 - R is not in position 2, and A is not in position 3.

 Now, we must choose a second guess that meets the following:
 - Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
 - Should use the knowledge we have: avoid C, N, E and include R and A, but not in the forbidden positions.

 Let's think about possible positions for R and A:
 - Since R cannot be in position 2, it can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 - Similarly, A cannot be in position 3, so it can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We also need to avoid the letters C, N, E.

 Given that, let's try to form a new word that includes R and A, and three other new letters (since we don't want to waste guesses on letters we know are absent).

 Common vowels besides A and E include I, O, U. Since E is out, we might use I or O. Also, common consonants that are not C or N: for example, T, S, L, etc.

 We should also try to test new letters to get more information.

 A good strategy might be to try a word that has R in a different position and A in a different position, and includes three new letters.

 Let me list some possibilities:

 We know R must be placed in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 and A in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Example words:
 - We might try a word with R in position 1 and A in position 2? But that leaves three more positions and we avoid C,N,E.
   Example: ""RADIO"" -> but D and I and O are new, and we don't know if they are in the word.

 However, note that we have only two known letters to include (R and A). We want to maximize new information.

 We could also try to include more common letters. In Wordle, common consonants include T, S, L, P, M, etc.

 Another idea: try a word that puts R in position 4 or 5 and A in position 1 or 2? But that might be too restrictive.

 Let me brainstorm:

 Possibility: Start with R? Then the word would be R????. Since A is available, put it in the second position? But we don't know if that's allowed. However, note the second position might be allowed for A? Actually, A can go in position 2 because the feedback only forbade position 3. So let's consider:

 - ""RAILS"": This would be R in 1 (new position) and A in 2 (which is allowed) and then I, L, S. But note: we have two letters R and A, and three new (I,L,S). However, ""RAILS"" has R in position 1 and A in position 2? Then the feedback for R would be ✓ if R is in the correct position? We don't know yet.

 However, we must be cautious: what if R is not in position 1? We don't know. We have to test.

 Alternatively, we can avoid putting R in position 2 (since last time R was in position 2 and was wrong) and avoid A in position 3.

 Since we have two letters that we know are present, we might choose a word that has these two and try different positions.

 Considering common letters: T, S, L, etc.

 Let me try a word that has R and A and also includes T and S? That way we cover more common letters.

 Example: ""STARS"": 
 - S at position 1, T at 2, A at 3, R at 4, S at 5? But wait, we have A at position 3 which is forbidden? So no, because feedback said A is not in position 3.

 We must avoid putting A in position 3.

 So, ""STARS"" has A in position 3 -> not allowed.

 What about ""TRAIL""? 
 - Positions: T, R, A, I, L.
 - Here, R is in position 2? But the previous guess had R in position 2 and it was marked wrong. So we know R cannot be in position 2? Therefore, TRAIL has R at position 2 -> not good.

 Let me think: we need R in a position that is not 2. So let's have positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5.

 Similarly, we want A to be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Possibilities:

 Option: R at position 1, A at position 4? 
 Example: ""ROTAL"" (which is not common) or ""RADIO"" (A at position 2, not 3) -> but R at position 1: ""RADIO"" -> R in 1, A in 2 (allowed because A can be in 2).

 But note: We also want to test other common letters.

 Another idea: ""PARTS"": 
 - P, A, R, T, S -> A in position 2? But then R in position 3? Because: P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5). 
   For A: position 2 is allowed (since forbidden only for position 3) and for R: position 3 is allowed? But wait, we don't know if position 3 is correct, but it's a possible position because last time R was in position 2 and was wrong, but could be 1,3,4,5.

 However, let's check if ""PARTS"" is valid. Yes, it is a word.

 But what about the letters? P is new, A at 2 (allowed), R at 3 (which we don't know, but we are testing), T and S new.

 Alternatively, ""ARTSY"" -> A at 1, R at 2 -> but R must not be at position 2 because we already tried R at position 2 and it was wrong? So invalid.

 Therefore, R at position 2 is forbidden. So we cannot have R at position 2.

 In ""PARTS"": R is at position 3 -> allowed? Yes.

 Also, A is at position 2 -> which is not position 3, so allowed.

 But wait: what if A was actually in position 2? Then we might get a match? That's okay because we are testing.

 Alternatively, let me consider ""SAVOR"": 
 - S(1), A(2), V(3), O(4), R(5). This places A at position 2 and R at position 5.

 This avoids putting R in a position we know it wasn't (position 2) and avoids A in position 3.

 The letters S, V, O are new. 

 However, we have two known present letters (A and R) and three new (S,V,O). Also common letters: S and O are common.

 Another common word: ""ROAST"" -> but we cannot because E is in ROAST? No, ROAST has O,A,S,T,R -> R at 1, O at 2? But note, O is new? Remember we only know about C,N,E being absent. Also, check: ROAST has R(1), O(2), A(3), S(4), T(5). But A is at position 3? Which is the forbidden position? So that's not allowed.

 Therefore, no A at position 3.

 After considering, I think ""PARTS"" is acceptable: 
 Positions: 
 - P (letter not tested)
 - A (in position 2, which is allowed)
 - R (in position 3, not 2 -> allowed)
 - T (new)
 - S (new)

 Another option: ""TARPS"": 
 - T(1), A(2), R(3), P(4), S(5). Similar. 

 But ""PARTS"" is more common.

 However, note: we haven't tested T and S. So let's pick a word that includes T, S and avoids E and N.

 Also, we might consider ""RATIO"": 
 - R at 1, A at 2, T at 3, I at 4, O at 5 -> Then R at position 1 (not 2) and A at 2 (allowed). But T, I, O are new.

 But ""RATIO"" is a valid word.

 Which is better? ""PARTS"" or ""RATIO""? 

 Since we don't have any constraints on other letters, let me choose one that maximizes new letters coverage.

 We know we need to find the word. Both are valid.

 I'll choose ""PARTS"" because it includes both S and T, which are common.

 Therefore, let me guess ""PARTS"".

 But again, check: 
 - We are avoiding C, N, E, which is done.
 - Includes A and R, which is required.
 - A is in position 2? That's okay.
 - R is in position 3? That's okay.

 Alternatively, let me double-check: what if the word actually has A in position 2 and R in position 3? Then we'd get some ✓.

 But regardless, we are testing.

 We might also consider that in our first guess, R was in position 2 and A in position 3? But now we are moving them.

 I think ""PARTS"" is a valid choice.

 Let's see other options: ""STAIR""? 
 - S(1), T(2), A(3) -> wait, A cannot be in position 3? So invalid.

 ""ALARM"": 
 - A(1), L(2), A(3) -> A is at position 3? So invalid? 
   Actually, the feedback said the letter A is in the word but not in position 3? Then in ""ALARM"", A is in position 1 and 3 -> but at position 3 it would be wrong? So that would be bad because we know A is present, but we must not put it in position 3? Actually, the rule says we get a '-' only if the letter is present and not in that position, and we might have multiple As? 

 The feedback for 'A' in the first guess (position 3) was '-', meaning that there is an A but not at position 3. This doesn't prevent A from being at other positions. And if there are two A's? Then we might have one at 3 and one elsewhere? Actually: the '-' for a letter only indicates that at least one instance is present and that particular instance is not in the correct position. But there could be multiple. However, if we put an A in position 3, we might get a '-' again (if there is another A) or even a ✓ if the second A is at position 3? Actually, the rule: the feedback is per letter in the guess. So if we put A in position 3 again, and the secret has an A in position 3, then we would get a ✓. But if not, we might get a '-' or even an 'x'? 

 But wait: the feedback for each position corresponds to the letter in that position. So if the secret has one A and it is at position 2, then if we guess a word with A at position 3, we would get an 'x' for that position? Or wait: no, because the '-' means the letter is in the word but not in that position? Actually, we must read the rules:

 Feedback for a letter in the guess:
 - ✓ : the letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
 - - : the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
 - x : the letter is NOT in the word.

 So if the secret word has exactly one A at position 2, then:
 - In position 2: A would get ✓.
 - In any other position: if we put A, it would get an 'x'? Because the secret has only one A? Or wait: the feedback marks the letter independent of duplicates? Actually, the standard rule: each letter in the guess is compared to the secret. For duplicates, it's a bit tricky.

 However, to avoid complication, we know that we must avoid putting R at position 2 and A at position 3? Why? Because the previous feedback said for position 2: R was present (so in the word) but not there. Similarly, A at position 3 was not there.

 But note: it doesn't preclude the possibility that R could be in position 2 if there are two R's? Actually, no: if the secret had two R's, one of which is in position 2, then when we guessed R at position 2 we would have gotten a ✓. Since we got a '-' for R at position 2, that means that position 2 is not R? So even if there are two R's, position 2 still cannot be R? 

 Actually, no: the '-' for R at position 2 means that the letter R is in the word, but that specific position (2) is not R. So if there are two R's, one in position 1 and one in position 3, then if we guess R at position 2, we get a '-' because there is an R in the word? But position 2 is wrong.

 However, we don't know the number of occurrences. We do know that position 2 is not R? Because if position 2 were R, we would have gotten a ✓? 

 So by deduction: the '-' means that the letter is in the word but NOT in that position. Therefore, we know that the specific position we guessed is NOT that letter? Similarly, for A at position 3: we know that position 3 is not A? 

 So we avoid putting R in position 2 and A in position 3? Yes.

 Therefore, we must avoid position 2 for R and position 3 for A.

 In ""PARTS"":
 - Position 2: A -> allowed because we can have A at position 2? The previous feedback only forbade position 3 for A? We haven't tested position 2 for A. Actually, we have tested position 3? Then A can be at 2? Yes.

 Let me check:

 First guess: crane -> position 2 is R? and position 3 is A? and we got R(-) and A(-). So we know:
   Position 2: not R? How does this affect position 2 for A? 
   Position 3: not A? How does this affect position 2 for R? 

 They are independent: we can have A at position 2? Yes, because the feedback for A said it was present but not at position 3? So position 2 is open? Similarly, we cannot have A at position 3? 

 So ""PARTS"" is valid: 
   P at position 1 (new)
   A at position 2: we don't know if it's correct? But we are going to test it? It's allowed and we'll get feedback.

 So I'll go with ""PARTS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)):
- Letters C, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- Letters R and A **are** in the secret word, but:
  - R is not in position 2 (since it was marked as ""-"" in position 2 of ""crane"").
  - A is not in position 3.

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Include **R** and **A** (since they are part of the word).
2. Avoid C, N, E.
3. Place R anywhere **except position 2** (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
4. Place A anywhere **except position 3** (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
5. Introduce new letters to gather more information.

I chose **""parts""** because:
- It includes R (in position 3) and A (in position 2), avoiding forbidden positions.
- It introduces new common letters: P, T, S (which are frequent in English 5-letter words).
- It avoids C, N, E entirely.

This guess helps test the positions of R and A while probing three new consonants. If A is correctly placed in position 2 or R in position 3, the feedback will confirm it. Otherwise, it rules out more possibilities.

That way we cover more common letters.\n\n Example: ""STARS"": \n - S at position 1, T at 2, A at 3, R at 4, S at 5? But wait, we have A at position 3 which is forbidden? So no, because feedback said A is not in position 3.\n\n We must avoid putting A in position 3.\n\n So, ""STARS"" has A in position 3 -> not allowed.\n\n What about ""TRAIL""? \n - Positions: T, R, A, I, L.\n - Here, R is in position 2? But the previous guess had R in position 2 and it was marked wrong. So we know R cannot be in position 2? Therefore, TRAIL has R at position 2 -> not good.\n\n Let me think: we need R in a position that is not 2. So let\'s have positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5.\n\n Similarly, we want A to be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n Possibilities:\n\n Option: R at position 1, A at position 4? \n Example: ""ROTAL"" (which is not common) or ""RADIO"" (A at position 2, not 3) -> but R at position 1: ""RADIO"" -> R in 1, A in 2 (allowed because A can be in 2).\n\n But note: We also want to test other common letters.\n\n Another idea: ""PARTS"": \n - P, A, R, T, S -> A in position 2? But then R in position 3? Because: P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5). \n   For A: position 2 is allowed (since forbidden only for position 3) and for R: position 3 is allowed? But wait, we don\'t know if position 3 is correct, but it\'s a possible position because last time R was in position 2 and was wrong, but could be 1,3,4,5.\n\n However, let\'s check if ""PARTS"" is valid. Yes, it is a word.\n\n But what about the letters? P is new, A at 2 (allowed), R at 3 (which we don\'t know, but we are testing), T and S new.\n\n Alternatively, ""ARTSY"" -> A at 1, R at 2 -> but R must not be at position 2 because we already tried R at position 2 and it was wrong? So invalid.\n\n Therefore, R at position 2 is forbidden. So we cannot have R at position 2.\n\n In ""PARTS"": R is at position 3 -> allowed? Yes.\n\n Also, A is at position 2 -> which is not position 3, so allowed.\n\n But wait: what if A was actually in position 2? Then we might get a match? That\'s okay because we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, let me consider ""SAVOR"": \n - S(1), A(2), V(3), O(4), R(5). This places A at position 2 and R at position 5.\n\n This avoids putting R in a position we know it wasn\'t (position 2) and avoids A in position 3.\n\n The letters S, V, O are new. \n\n However, we have two known present letters (A and R) and three new (S,V,O). Also common letters: S and O are common.\n\n Another common word: ""ROAST"" -> but we cannot because E is in ROAST? No, ROAST has O,A,S,T,R -> R at 1, O at 2? But note, O is new? Remember we only know about C,N,E being absent. Also, check: ROAST has R(1), O(2), A(3), S(4), T(5). But A is at position 3? Which is the forbidden position? So that\'s not allowed.\n\n Therefore, no A at position 3.\n\n After considering, I think ""PARTS"" is acceptable: \n Positions: \n - P (letter not tested)\n - A (in position 2, which is allowed)\n - R (in position 3, not 2 -> allowed)\n - T (new)\n - S (new)\n\n Another option: ""TARPS"": \n - T(1), A(2), R(3), P(4), S(5). Similar. \n\n But ""PARTS"" is more common.\n\n However, note: we haven\'t tested T and S. So let\'s pick a word that includes T, S and avoids E and N.\n\n Also, we might consider ""RATIO"": \n - R at 1, A at 2, T at 3, I at 4, O at 5 -> Then R at position 1 (not 2) and A at 2 (allowed). But T, I, O are new.\n\n But ""RATIO"" is a valid word.\n\n Which is better? ""PARTS"" or ""RATIO""? \n\n Since we don\'t have any constraints on other letters, let me choose one that maximizes new letters coverage.\n\n We know we need to find the word. Both are valid.\n\n I\'ll choose ""PARTS"" because it includes both S and T, which are common.\n\n Therefore, let me guess ""PARTS"".\n\n But again, check: \n - We are avoiding C, N, E, which is done.\n - Includes A and R, which is required.\n - A is in position 2? That\'s okay.\n - R is in position 3? That\'s okay.\n\n Alternatively, let me double-check: what if the word actually has A in position 2 and R in position 3? Then we\'d get some ✓.\n\n But regardless, we are testing.\n\n We might also consider that in our first guess, R was in position 2 and A in position 3? But now we are moving them.\n\n I think ""PARTS"" is a valid choice.\n\n Let\'s see other options: ""STAIR""? \n - S(1), T(2), A(3) -> wait, A cannot be in position 3? So invalid.\n\n ""ALARM"": \n - A(1), L(2), A(3) -> A is at position 3? So invalid? \n   Actually, the feedback said the letter A is in the word but not in position 3? Then in ""ALARM"", A is in position 1 and 3 -> but at position 3 it would be wrong? So that would be bad because we know A is present, but we must not put it in position 3? Actually, the rule says we get a \'-\' only if the letter is present and not in that position, and we might have multiple As? \n\n The feedback for \'A\' in the first guess (position 3) was \'-\', meaning that there is an A but not at position 3. This doesn\'t prevent A from being at other positions. And if there are two A\'s? Then we might have one at 3 and one elsewhere? Actually: the \'-\' for a letter only indicates that at least one instance is present and that particular instance is not in the correct position. But there could be multiple. However, if we put an A in position 3, we might get a \'-\' again (if there is another A) or even a ✓ if the second A is at position 3? Actually, the rule: the feedback is per letter in the guess. So if we put A in position 3 again, and the secret has an A in position 3, then we would get a ✓. But if not, we might get a \'-\' or even an \'x\'? \n\n But wait: the feedback for each position corresponds to the letter in that position. So if the secret has one A and it is at position 2, then if we guess a word with A at position 3, we would get an \'x\' for that position? Or wait: no, because the \'-\' means the letter is in the word but not in that position? Actually, we must read the rules:\n\n Feedback for a letter in the guess:\n - ✓ : the letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.\n - - : the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.\n - x : the letter is NOT in the word.\n\n So if the secret word has exactly one A at position 2, then:\n - In position 2: A would get ✓.\n - In any other position: if we put A, it would get an \'x\'? Because the secret has only one A? Or wait: the feedback marks the letter independent of duplicates? Actually, the standard rule: each letter in the guess is compared to the secret. For duplicates, it\'s a bit tricky.\n\n However, to avoid complication, we know that we must avoid putting R at position 2 and A at position 3? Why? Because the previous feedback said for position 2: R was present (so in the word) but not there. Similarly, A at position 3 was not there.\n\n But note: it doesn\'t preclude the possibility that R could be in position 2 if there are two R\'s? Actually, no: if the secret had two R\'s, one of which is in position 2, then when we guessed R at position 2 we would have gotten a ✓. Since we got a \'-\' for R at position 2, that means that position 2 is not R? So even if there are two R\'s, position 2 still cannot be R? \n\n Actually, no: the \'-\' for R at position 2 means that the letter R is in the word, but that specific position (2) is not R. So if there are two R\'s, one in position 1 and one in position 3, then if we guess R at position 2, we get a \'-\' because there is an R in the word? But position 2 is wrong.\n\n However, we don\'t know the number of occurrences. We do know that position 2 is not R? Because if position 2 were R, we would have gotten a ✓? \n\n So by deduction: the \'-\' means that the letter is in the word but NOT in that position. Therefore, we know that the specific position we guessed is NOT that letter? Similarly, for A at position 3: we know that position 3 is not A? \n\n So we avoid putting R in position 2 and A in position 3? Yes.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid position 2 for R and position 3 for A.\n\n In ""PARTS"":\n - Position 2: A -> allowed because we can have A at position 2? The previous feedback only forbade position 3 for A? We haven\'t tested position 2 for A. Actually, we have tested position 3? Then A can be at 2? Yes.\n\n Let me check:\n\n First guess: crane -> position 2 is R? and position 3 is A? and we got R(-) and A(-). So we know:\n   Position 2: not R? How does this affect position 2 for A? \n   Position 3: not A? How does this affect position 2 for R? \n\n They are independent: we can have A at position 2? Yes, because the feedback for A said it was present but not at position 3? So position 2 is open? Similarly, we cannot have A at position 3? \n\n So ""PARTS"" is valid: \n   P at position 1 (new)\n   A at position 2: we don\'t know if it\'s correct? But we are going to test it? It\'s allowed and we\'ll get feedback.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""PARTS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)):\n- Letters C, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.\n- Letters R and A **are** in the secret word, but:\n  - R is not in position 2 (since it was marked as ""-"" in position 2 of ""crane"").\n  - A is not in position 3.\n\nFor the second guess, I need to:\n1. Include **R** and **A** (since they are part of the word).\n2. Avoid C, N, E.\n3. Place R anywhere **except position 2** (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).\n4. Place A anywhere **except position 3** (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).\n5. Introduce new letters to gather more information.\n\nI chose **""parts""** because:\n- It includes R (in position 3) and A (in position 2), avoiding forbidden positions.\n- It introduces new common letters: P, T, S (which are frequent in English 5-letter words).\n- It avoids C, N, E entirely.\n\nThis guess helps test the positions of R and A while probing three new consonants. If A is correctly placed in position 2 or R in position 3, the feedback will confirm it. Otherwise, it rules out more possibilities.\n\n<guess>parts</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: parts -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: not in word (x)
- R: in word but wrong position (-) → so R is in the word, but not at position 2
- A: in word but wrong position (-) → so A is in the word, but not at position 3
- N: not in word (x)
- E: not in word (x)

Guess 2: ""parts""
- P: not in word (x)
- A: correct position (✓) → so A is in the word and at position 2
- R: correct position (✓) → so R is in the word and at position 3
- T: not in word (x)
- S: not in word (x)

Now, combining the information:

1. The secret word has A at position 2 and R at position 3. So the word pattern is: _ A R _ _

2. Letters that are not in the word: C, N, E, P, T, S (from the x's in both guesses)

3. We know the word must have A at position 2 and R at position 3, and we need to find the remaining three letters (positions 1, 4, and 5) which are not C, N, E, P, T, S.

4. Also, note that in the first guess, we had A and R present, and now we know their positions: A at 2 and R at 3. The first guess had A at position 3 (which we now know is wrong) and R at position 2 (which we now know is wrong) — consistent.

Now, we need to think of words that fit: _ A R _ _

And the missing letters cannot be: C, E, N, P, T, S.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

What letters are left? The alphabet minus the used ones: 
Used and absent: C, E, N, P, T, S
Used and present: A, R (but we know their positions)

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a 5-letter word with the pattern: [letter1] A R [letter4] [letter5]

We can try to think of common words that fit this pattern.

Common words with _ A R _ _:

- BOARD: B O A R D → but O and D are available? Let's check: B, O, A, R, D → positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:R, 4:?, 5:D → pattern is _ A R _ _ so BOARD would be B A R D? No, BOARD is B O A R D → that's positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:A, 4:R, 5:D → so it doesn't fit our pattern (we need A at 2 and R at 3). So no.

We need the second letter to be A and the third to be R.

Examples:
- LARVA: L A R V A → but we have two A's? Let's see: position 1: L, 2: A, 3: R, 4: V, 5: A → this fits the pattern. And letters: L, V, A (A is already known). But we have to check if L and V are allowed? We haven't eliminated them.

But note: the word has two A's? The feedback from the first guess: we had one A and it was marked as present but not at position 3. Now we have A at position 2 (correct) and we are adding another A at position 5? Is that possible? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. But we don't know if there is a duplicate A? It's possible.

But let's see: in the first guess, we had only one A (in position 3) and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't rule out multiple A's. Similarly, in the second guess, we have A at position 2 (correct) and that's it. So if there is another A, it's possible.

But we have to consider: the feedback for the second guess: we only have two ✓ and three x's. So the letters P, T, S are absent. But we don't know about L, V, etc.

Another common word: ""MARRY"" → M A R R Y → but that has two R's? And we have R at position 3 (correct) and then another R at position 4? But we don't know if there is a duplicate R? Also, the pattern: M A R R Y → positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:R, 4:R, 5:Y → fits the pattern. But we have to check if M and Y are allowed? Yes, not eliminated.

But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. Now we have R at position 3 (correct) and we are adding another R at position 4? That might be possible.

But we don't have any information about duplicates. So we should consider words with duplicates? But to be safe, we might avoid duplicates for now? Or not? We don't know.

Another word: ""HAREM"" → H A R E M → but E is eliminated (from first guess: E is not in the word). So cannot use E.

Similarly, ""BARGE"" → B A R G E → E is eliminated.

""FARCE"" → F A R C E → C and E eliminated.

""LARGE"" → L A R G E → E eliminated.

""PARSE"" → P and E eliminated.

So we need to avoid E, C, N, P, T, S.

Let me list possible words:

- ""HARDY"": H A R D Y → positions: 1:H, 2:A, 3:R, 4:D, 5:Y → letters: H, D, Y → all not eliminated? H, D, Y are in the available set. So possible.

- ""MARRY"": M A R R Y → 1:M, 2:A, 3:R, 4:R, 5:Y → M and Y are available. But duplicate R? We don't know if duplicate is allowed? But we can try.

- ""LARVA"": L A R V A → 1:L, 2:A, 3:R, 4:V, 5:A → L and V available, and duplicate A? Possible.

- ""BARMY"": B A R M Y → 1:B, 2:A, 3:R, 4:M, 5:Y → B, M, Y available.

- ""JARUL"" — not a word.

- ""KARST"" — but S and T are eliminated? T and S are out. So no.

- ""WARNS"" — S and N eliminated? N and S are out. So no.

- ""DARKY"" — D A R K Y → 1:D, 2:A, 3:R, 4:K, 5:Y → D, K, Y available.

- ""HARKY"" — not common.

- ""FARMY"" — not common.

- ""CARVY"" — not common.

- ""VARNA"" — V A R N A → but N is eliminated? N is out. So no.

- ""MARLY"" — M A R L Y → 1:M, 2:A, 3:R, 4:L, 5:Y → M, L, Y available.

- ""BARNY"" — B A R N Y → N eliminated? N is out. So no.

- ""WACKY"" — but no R? We need R at position 3? And pattern must be _ A R _ _.

So possible candidates: HARDY, MARRY, LARVA, BARMY, DARKY, MARLY.

We need to choose one that maximizes new information. Since we have three positions to guess (1,4,5) and we want to test as many new letters as possible.

We have to avoid the eliminated letters: C, E, N, P, T, S.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want to test letters that are common to narrow down.

Let's consider:

- ""HARDY"": tests H, D, Y
- ""MARRY"": tests M, Y (and duplicate R, but we already know R is present? So we don't get new information about R? But we might get information about duplicate? However, if we get a ✓ for the second R, we know there is a duplicate. But if we get x, then no duplicate? But we are not sure. Also, we are testing M and Y.

But note: in ""MARRY"", the fourth letter is R. We know R is in the word, but we don't know if it is at position 4? So we might get a ✓ or - or x? Actually, if there is only one R, then the R at position 4 would be marked as x? Because the R is already accounted for at position 3? Or wait: the feedback marks each letter independently? 

Standard Wordle rules: if the secret has one R and we guess two R's, then one of them (the one in the correct position) would be ✓, and the other would be x? Or if the secret has two R's, then both could be marked? 

But in this case, we know position 3 is R (✓ from second guess). So if the secret has only one R, then any other R we guess would be x. If the secret has two R's, then if we guess R in a position where it exists, we get ✓ or -.

But we don't know. So guessing a word with duplicate R might not be efficient? Because we are using a slot to test a letter we already know? But we are testing for duplicate and position.

Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates and test three new letters.

So let's choose a word without duplicates? Like ""HARDY"" or ""BARMY"" or ""MARLY"".

""HARDY"": H, D, Y
""BARMY"": B, M, Y
""MARLY"": M, L, Y

We also have ""DARKY"": D, K, Y

And ""LARVA"": L, V, and duplicate A? But we know A is present? So similar issue.

To maximize new letters, we might choose a word that has letters that are common and we haven't tested.

Common letters left: B, D, H, L, M, O, U, Y, etc.

We might also consider that the word might have vowels? We have A, but what about O, U, I? We haven't tested any vowels except A and E (which is out). So maybe we should test a vowel? Like O or I? But we don't know.

For example, ""MORAY"" → M O R A Y → but pattern: M(1), O(2) → but we need A at position 2? So no.

We need the second letter to be A and third to be R. So the word must be [consonant?] A R [something] [something]

Many words with AR are followed by a consonant? Or vowel? 

For example: ""HAREM"" but E is out.

""BARON"" → B A R O N → but N is out.

""FARGO"" → F A R G O → F, G, O → all available? F, G, O are not eliminated. So ""FARGO"" is a word? It's a proper noun? But Wordle usually allows common nouns, but sometimes proper nouns? Actually, Wordle uses common words, and ""FARGO"" might be considered? But let's avoid if possible.

""BARON"" is out because of N.

""TAROT"" → T is out.

""CAROL"" → C out.

""PAROL"" → P out.

""MARON"" → N out.

""VARDO"" → V A R D O → V, D, O → available. But is ""VARDO"" a common word? It's a Gypsy wagon? Not very common.

""KARMA"" → K A R M A → K, M, and duplicate A? Pattern: 1:K, 2:A, 3:R, 4:M, 5:A → K and M available? But duplicate A? And we are testing K and M.

But ""KARMA"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""LARVA"" is common.

""MANOR"" → M A N O R → but N is out? N eliminated.

""MAJOR"" → M A J O R → but pattern: M(1), A(2), J(3) → but we need R at position 3? So no, because position 3 is J, not R.

We need position 3 to be R? So the word must have R at position 3.

So let's list common words that fit the pattern and use available letters:

- HARDY (H, D, Y)
- BARMY (B, M, Y) — but ""barmy"" is a word (meaning crazy)
- MARLY (M, L, Y) — ""marly"" (resembling marl)
- DARKY (D, K, Y) — but this might be offensive? Avoid.
- KARMA (K, M, A) — duplicate A, and K and M
- LARVA (L, V, A) — duplicate A, and L and V
- FARGO (F, G, O) — proper noun? Not ideal.

I think ""HARDY"" is a good choice: it's common and tests H, D, Y.

""MARLY"" is less common.

""KARMA"" is common and tests K and M, but has duplicate A? We don't know if duplicate A is present? But we can try.

To avoid duplicates, I'll go with ""HARDY"".

But let's see: if we guess ""HARDY"", and if it's not the word, we get feedback on H, D, Y.

Similarly, if we guess ""KARMA"", we get feedback on K, M, and whether there is a duplicate A? But we already know A is present? So the feedback for the second A might be x if no duplicate? Or - if duplicate and in wrong position? Or ✓ if duplicate and in correct position? But we don't know position 5? So it might be messy.

So I think ""HARDY"" is a safe choice.

Therefore, I'll guess ""HARDY"".

But note: we have to make sure that H, D, Y are not eliminated? They are not in the eliminated list.

Eliminated: C, E, N, P, T, S.

So H, D, Y are fine.

So the guess is ""HARDY"".

But let me confirm the pattern: H A R D Y → positions: 1:H, 2:A, 3:R, 4:D, 5:Y → matches _ A R _ _

And we have A at 2 (correct) and R at 3 (correct) as per previous feedback.

So we are only testing the first, fourth, and fifth positions.

If the word is ""HARDY"", we win. If not, we get feedback on H, D, Y.

So I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - C, N, E are **absent**.  
  - R and A are **present** but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively.  

- **Guess 2: parts** → P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), S(x)  
  - P, T, S are **absent**.  
  - A is **correct** at position 2.  
  - R is **correct** at position 3.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A R _ _` (A at position 2, R at position 3).  
- **Absent letters**: C, E, N, P, T, S (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Present letters**: A and R (already confirmed in positions 2 and 3).  
- **Unknown positions**: 1, 4, and 5 must be filled with letters not in the absent list. Available letters include B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test high-frequency letters from the available set (e.g., D, H, L, M, Y) to maximize information.  
- Prioritize words that avoid duplicates (since we have no evidence of duplicate letters yet) and cover new letters.  
- **""HARDY""** fits well:  
  - Pattern: `H A R D Y` (A✓ at 2, R✓ at 3).  
  - Tests new letters: H (position 1), D (position 4), Y (position 5).  
  - Avoids absent letters and duplicates.  
  - Common word, increasing the likelihood of narrowing down possibilities.  

If ""HARDY"" is incorrect, the feedback on H, D, and Y will help identify the remaining letters.  

<guess>hardy</guess>",hardy,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: not in word (x)
- R: in word but wrong position (-) → so R is in the word, but not at position 2
- A: in word but wrong position (-) → so A is in the word, but not at position 3
- N: not in word (x)
- E: not in word (x)

Guess 2: ""parts""
- P: not in word (x)
- A: correct position (✓) → so A is in the word and at position 2
- R: correct position (✓) → so R is in the word and at position 3
- T: not in word (x)
- S: not in word (x)

Now, combining the information:

1. The secret word has A at position 2 and R at position 3. So the word pattern is: _ A R _ _

2. Letters that are not in the word: C, N, E, P, T, S (from the x's in both guesses)

3. We know the word must have A at position 2 and R at position 3, and we need to find the remaining three letters (positions 1, 4, and 5) which are not C, N, E, P, T, S.

4. Also, note that in the first guess, we had A and R present, and now we know their positions: A at 2 and R at 3. The first guess had A at position 3 (which we now know is wrong) and R at position 2 (which we now know is wrong) — consistent.

Now, we need to think of words that fit: _ A R _ _

And the missing letters cannot be: C, E, N, P, T, S.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

What letters are left? The alphabet minus the used ones: 
Used and absent: C, E, N, P, T, S
Used and present: A, R (but we know their positions)

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a 5-letter word with the pattern: [letter1] A R [letter4] [letter5]

We can try to think of common words that fit this pattern.

Common words with _ A R _ _:

- BOARD: B O A R D → but O and D are available? Let's check: B, O, A, R, D → positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:R, 4:?, 5:D → pattern is _ A R _ _ so BOARD would be B A R D? No, BOARD is B O A R D → that's positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:A, 4:R, 5:D → so it doesn't fit our pattern (we need A at 2 and R at 3). So no.

We need the second letter to be A and the third to be R.

Examples:
- LARVA: L A R V A → but we have two A's? Let's see: position 1: L, 2: A, 3: R, 4: V, 5: A → this fits the pattern. And letters: L, V, A (A is already known). But we have to check if L and V are allowed? We haven't eliminated them.

But note: the word has two A's? The feedback from the first guess: we had one A and it was marked as present but not at position 3. Now we have A at position 2 (correct) and we are adding another A at position 5? Is that possible? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. But we don't know if there is a duplicate A? It's possible.

But let's see: in the first guess, we had only one A (in position 3) and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't rule out multiple A's. Similarly, in the second guess, we have A at position 2 (correct) and that's it. So if there is another A, it's possible.

But we have to consider: the feedback for the second guess: we only have two ✓ and three x's. So the letters P, T, S are absent. But we don't know about L, V, etc.

Another common word: ""MARRY"" → M A R R Y → but that has two R's? And we have R at position 3 (correct) and then another R at position 4? But we don't know if there is a duplicate R? Also, the pattern: M A R R Y → positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:R, 4:R, 5:Y → fits the pattern. But we have to check if M and Y are allowed? Yes, not eliminated.

But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. Now we have R at position 3 (correct) and we are adding another R at position 4? That might be possible.

But we don't have any information about duplicates. So we should consider words with duplicates? But to be safe, we might avoid duplicates for now? Or not? We don't know.

Another word: ""HAREM"" → H A R E M → but E is eliminated (from first guess: E is not in the word). So cannot use E.

Similarly, ""BARGE"" → B A R G E → E is eliminated.

""FARCE"" → F A R C E → C and E eliminated.

""LARGE"" → L A R G E → E eliminated.

""PARSE"" → P and E eliminated.

So we need to avoid E, C, N, P, T, S.

Let me list possible words:

- ""HARDY"": H A R D Y → positions: 1:H, 2:A, 3:R, 4:D, 5:Y → letters: H, D, Y → all not eliminated? H, D, Y are in the available set. So possible.

- ""MARRY"": M A R R Y → 1:M, 2:A, 3:R, 4:R, 5:Y → M and Y are available. But duplicate R? We don't know if duplicate is allowed? But we can try.

- ""LARVA"": L A R V A → 1:L, 2:A, 3:R, 4:V, 5:A → L and V available, and duplicate A? Possible.

- ""BARMY"": B A R M Y → 1:B, 2:A, 3:R, 4:M, 5:Y → B, M, Y available.

- ""JARUL"" — not a word.

- ""KARST"" — but S and T are eliminated? T and S are out. So no.

- ""WARNS"" — S and N eliminated? N and S are out. So no.

- ""DARKY"" — D A R K Y → 1:D, 2:A, 3:R, 4:K, 5:Y → D, K, Y available.

- ""HARKY"" — not common.

- ""FARMY"" — not common.

- ""CARVY"" — not common.

- ""VARNA"" — V A R N A → but N is eliminated? N is out. So no.

- ""MARLY"" — M A R L Y → 1:M, 2:A, 3:R, 4:L, 5:Y → M, L, Y available.

- ""BARNY"" — B A R N Y → N eliminated? N is out. So no.

- ""WACKY"" — but no R? We need R at position 3? And pattern must be _ A R _ _.

So possible candidates: HARDY, MARRY, LARVA, BARMY, DARKY, MARLY.

We need to choose one that maximizes new information. Since we have three positions to guess (1,4,5) and we want to test as many new letters as possible.

We have to avoid the eliminated letters: C, E, N, P, T, S.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want to test letters that are common to narrow down.

Let's consider:

- ""HARDY"": tests H, D, Y
- ""MARRY"": tests M, Y (and duplicate R, but we already know R is present? So we don't get new information about R? But we might get information about duplicate? However, if we get a ✓ for the second R, we know there is a duplicate. But if we get x, then no duplicate? But we are not sure. Also, we are testing M and Y.

But note: in ""MARRY"", the fourth letter is R. We know R is in the word, but we don't know if it is at position 4? So we might get a ✓ or - or x? Actually, if there is only one R, then the R at position 4 would be marked as x? Because the R is already accounted for at position 3? Or wait: the feedback marks each letter independently? 

Standard Wordle rules: if the secret has one R and we guess two R's, then one of them (the one in the correct position) would be ✓, and the other would be x? Or if the secret has two R's, then both could be marked? 

But in this case, we know position 3 is R (✓ from second guess). So if the secret has only one R, then any other R we guess would be x. If the secret has two R's, then if we guess R in a position where it exists, we get ✓ or -.

But we don't know. So guessing a word with duplicate R might not be efficient? Because we are using a slot to test a letter we already know? But we are testing for duplicate and position.

Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates and test three new letters.

So let's choose a word without duplicates? Like ""HARDY"" or ""BARMY"" or ""MARLY"".

""HARDY"": H, D, Y
""BARMY"": B, M, Y
""MARLY"": M, L, Y

We also have ""DARKY"": D, K, Y

And ""LARVA"": L, V, and duplicate A? But we know A is present? So similar issue.

To maximize new letters, we might choose a word that has letters that are common and we haven't tested.

Common letters left: B, D, H, L, M, O, U, Y, etc.

We might also consider that the word might have vowels? We have A, but what about O, U, I? We haven't tested any vowels except A and E (which is out). So maybe we should test a vowel? Like O or I? But we don't know.

For example, ""MORAY"" → M O R A Y → but pattern: M(1), O(2) → but we need A at position 2? So no.

We need the second letter to be A and third to be R. So the word must be [consonant?] A R [something] [something]

Many words with AR are followed by a consonant? Or vowel? 

For example: ""HAREM"" but E is out.

""BARON"" → B A R O N → but N is out.

""FARGO"" → F A R G O → F, G, O → all available? F, G, O are not eliminated. So ""FARGO"" is a word? It's a proper noun? But Wordle usually allows common nouns, but sometimes proper nouns? Actually, Wordle uses common words, and ""FARGO"" might be considered? But let's avoid if possible.

""BARON"" is out because of N.

""TAROT"" → T is out.

""CAROL"" → C out.

""PAROL"" → P out.

""MARON"" → N out.

""VARDO"" → V A R D O → V, D, O → available. But is ""VARDO"" a common word? It's a Gypsy wagon? Not very common.

""KARMA"" → K A R M A → K, M, and duplicate A? Pattern: 1:K, 2:A, 3:R, 4:M, 5:A → K and M available? But duplicate A? And we are testing K and M.

But ""KARMA"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""LARVA"" is common.

""MANOR"" → M A N O R → but N is out? N eliminated.

""MAJOR"" → M A J O R → but pattern: M(1), A(2), J(3) → but we need R at position 3? So no, because position 3 is J, not R.

We need position 3 to be R? So the word must have R at position 3.

So let's list common words that fit the pattern and use available letters:

- HARDY (H, D, Y)
- BARMY (B, M, Y) — but ""barmy"" is a word (meaning crazy)
- MARLY (M, L, Y) — ""marly"" (resembling marl)
- DARKY (D, K, Y) — but this might be offensive? Avoid.
- KARMA (K, M, A) — duplicate A, and K and M
- LARVA (L, V, A) — duplicate A, and L and V
- FARGO (F, G, O) — proper noun? Not ideal.

I think ""HARDY"" is a good choice: it's common and tests H, D, Y.

""MARLY"" is less common.

""KARMA"" is common and tests K and M, but has duplicate A? We don't know if duplicate A is present? But we can try.

To avoid duplicates, I'll go with ""HARDY"".

But let's see: if we guess ""HARDY"", and if it's not the word, we get feedback on H, D, Y.

Similarly, if we guess ""KARMA"", we get feedback on K, M, and whether there is a duplicate A? But we already know A is present? So the feedback for the second A might be x if no duplicate? Or - if duplicate and in wrong position? Or ✓ if duplicate and in correct position? But we don't know position 5? So it might be messy.

So I think ""HARDY"" is a safe choice.

Therefore, I'll guess ""HARDY"".

But note: we have to make sure that H, D, Y are not eliminated? They are not in the eliminated list.

Eliminated: C, E, N, P, T, S.

So H, D, Y are fine.

So the guess is ""HARDY"".

But let me confirm the pattern: H A R D Y → positions: 1:H, 2:A, 3:R, 4:D, 5:Y → matches _ A R _ _

And we have A at 2 (correct) and R at 3 (correct) as per previous feedback.

So we are only testing the first, fourth, and fifth positions.

If the word is ""HARDY"", we win. If not, we get feedback on H, D, Y.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - C, N, E are **absent**.  
  - R and A are **present** but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively.  

- **Guess 2: parts** → P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), S(x)  
  - P, T, S are **absent**.  
  - A is **correct** at position 2.  
  - R is **correct** at position 3.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A R _ _` (A at position 2, R at position 3).  
- **Absent letters**: C, E, N, P, T, S (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Present letters**: A and R (already confirmed in positions 2 and 3).  
- **Unknown positions**: 1, 4, and 5 must be filled with letters not in the absent list. Available letters include B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test high-frequency letters from the available set (e.g., D, H, L, M, Y) to maximize information.  
- Prioritize words that avoid duplicates (since we have no evidence of duplicate letters yet) and cover new letters.  
- **""HARDY""** fits well:  
  - Pattern: `H A R D Y` (A✓ at 2, R✓ at 3).  
  - Tests new letters: H (position 1), D (position 4), Y (position 5).  
  - Avoids absent letters and duplicates.  
  - Common word, increasing the likelihood of narrowing down possibilities.  

If ""HARDY"" is incorrect, the feedback on H, D, and Y will help identify the remaining letters.",Guess 3: hardy -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) A(✓) R(✓) D(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
