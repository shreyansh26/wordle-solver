We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, etc.

 I recall that ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning the accumulated earnings of a company) and it uses common letters. However, let me check if it's valid.
 Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is a very common starting word.

 But note: the problem says the word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

 Another good one is ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.

 However, I think ""SLATE"" is also a top choice. It has S, L, A, T, E.

 Since we are at the first guess, any of these would be fine.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it covers 5 common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(-) -> A is in the word but not in the position we guessed (position 3 in ""crane"").
 N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.
 E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word does not contain C, R, N, E.
 - It does contain the letter A, but not in the third position.

 Since the secret word is 5 letters and contains A, but not in position 3 (index 2, if we start counting at 0), then A must be in one of the positions: 0, 1, 3, or 4.

 We also know that the letters C, R, N, E are absent. So we avoid these.

 For the next guess, we need:
 - A 5-letter word that includes the letter A (in a position other than the third) and excludes C, R, N, E.
 - We want to test other common letters and try to cover additional letters.

 Let's think of common letters that haven't been tested yet. Remaining frequent letters: T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 We also note that the word must have A in either position 0, 1, 3, or 4.

 Possible strategy: choose a word that has A in a different position and uses other common consonants and vowels.

 Example possibilities:
 - Place A in position 0: words like ""AUDIO"", ""ABOUT"" but note that we cannot use R (in ""ABOUT"", R is absent? Actually, we don't have R because R is excluded). Let's check our constraints.

 But wait: we have to avoid C, R, N, E. So:
 - ""ABOUT"": contains B, O, U, T. And A at position 0. Also, it doesn't contain C, R, N, E? It has A: yes, but we must check the letters: A, B, O, U, T. So R, C, N, E are absent -> acceptable.

 - Alternatively, place A at position 1: words like ""SALAD"" but that has repeated A? Also, L is allowed and common. But note: we don't have constraints on repeated letters? However, the feedback didn't show double A so we don't know if the secret has repeated letters. But ""SALAD"" has two A's? Actually, ""SALAD"" isn't 5 unique letters? Let me think: we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Considering the above, let's try to choose a word with:
   - A in a position that isn't 2, and not 2 (which we already know) but also avoid position 3? We don't know, so we can put it in any of {0,1,3,4}.
   - Also include other common vowels and consonants: T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 However, note the feedback for A: we got a minus, meaning it's in the word but in a different position. So we don't know where exactly.

 Let me try to consider: the secret word has A, and we don't have any other known letters? So let's try to cover more ground.

 Another candidate: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T. A is at position 2? Wait, position 2 is the third character -> that wouldn't work because we know A isn't at position 2? Actually, the third position in the word is index 2 (if 0-indexed: positions 0,1,2,3,4). So in ""crane"", A was at index 2. Therefore, we must place A at index 0,1,3, or 4.

 In ""PLAIT"", if we break it down:
   P (0), L (1), A (2) -> index 2 is not allowed? Actually, we cannot put A at index 2 because we know that in the secret word A is not at index 2. Therefore, we must choose a word where A is at a different index.

 ""PLAIT"" is invalid for our purpose because it has A at index 2.

 Let me think of another word: ""TABLE""? But E is excluded -> we cannot use E.

 ""TABBY""? But Y is a possibility. However, we want to avoid excluded letters: E is excluded, so we cannot use E. Also ""TABBY"" has B twice? Also, A is at index 1: that's allowed.

 But wait, ""TABBY"": T(0), A(1), B(2), B(3), Y(4). We are using A at index 1, which is acceptable. However, we have repeated B? We don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. But it's okay to guess repeated letters? However, we are limited by the fact that we must avoid C, R, N, E.

 Alternatively, we could use ""AVAIL""? But then we have V and two A's? And V is less common. Also, we are avoiding R? The word ""AVAIL"" doesn't have R, C, N, E? So allowed. But our goal is to cover new letters.

 Let me try to find a word that doesn't have A at index 2 and uses common letters.

 Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

 How about ""SALAD""? But that has two A's? Still, A at index 1 and 3? Also, it has L and D. But let's write: S(0), A(1), L(2), A(3), D(4). So A appears at index 1 (which is allowed) and index 3 (which is also allowed). But we don't know if the secret word has two A's? We can use it.

 But note: the feedback doesn't tell us if a letter appears more than once, unless we get multiple minuses or checks? Actually, the feedback per letter: if we guess two A's and there is one A in the secret, we might get one minus and one x? So it's okay to try.

 However, let's choose a more efficient word: a word that uses five new distinct letters including A? But A is required.

 We know A must be in the word, so we can choose a word that has A and four letters we haven't tried.

 Let me think: ""PLANT"" is not good because N is excluded? We cannot use N.

 How about ""PLAIT"" but we cannot use A at index 2? So we skip.

 Alternative: ""PASTA"" -> P, A, S, T, A -> two A's? But A at index 1 and 4? Actually, positions: index0: P, index1: A (allowed), index2: S, index3: T, index4: A (allowed). And no E, R, C, N? Actually, we are excluding C, R, N, E -> so P, A, S, T are okay? The word is valid.

 But let me check if ""PASTA"" is a valid English word? Yes.

 However, we haven't tried S, T, and P? That's good.

 Alternatively, ""TOAST"" -> but has T and O, but S. However, ""TOAST"" contains T twice? And A at index 2? Wait, index0:T, index1:O, index2:A? We cannot put A at index 2? So invalid.

 Instead, what about ""PAINT""? N is excluded? We cannot use N.

 Let me think: ""SLATE"" is not possible because E is excluded.

 How about ""BASIC""? Well, C is excluded? C is absent -> we cannot use C? But C is excluded? So no.

 Another: ""ABOUT"": A at index0? That's allowed: A(0), B(1), O(2), U(3), T(4). Letters: A, B, O, U, T. None of C, R, N, E? So it's valid.

 Also, ""ABOUT"" uses common vowels and consonants? Yes.

 Additionally, it uses B, O, U, T? We haven't checked these.

 Alternatively, ""ADIEU"" is not allowed because E is excluded.

 So ""ABOUT"" seems a good candidate.

 But note: what about ""AUDIO""? That has A at index0? A(0), U(1), D(2), I(3), O(4). Also, avoids excluded letters? Yes? It has D and I? And we avoid C, R, N, E? So yes.

 Let's compare:

 ""ABOUT"" vs ""AUDIO"": both contain A at index0, but which gives more information?

 We know the secret word has A? So in either word, we are testing:

 For ""ABOUT"": 
   Position0: A -> if it's correct we get check, if wrong we know A is not at 0? And similarly for the other letters.

 For ""AUDIO"": also tests U, D, I, O.

 But note: vowels are often in words? However, we already know that the secret contains A? Let's not forget that.

 I think both are acceptable.

 Another candidate: ""PATIO""? That has A at index1: P, A, T, I, O? That's also good? And it doesn't use excluded letters? Yes.

 Comparison of letters:

 ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T
 ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O
 ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O

 Which one? They all test A in a different position? Actually, ""ABOUT"" tests A at position0, ""PATIO"" tests A at position1, and ""AUDIO"" tests A at position0.

 Since we have no information about where A is (except that it's not at index2), testing A at a different position might be beneficial? We have already tested index2? So let's try index0 or index1?

 How about testing A in a position we haven't tested? Currently we only know about index2? So index0,1,3,4 are untested? We can choose any.

 Let me think: if we put A at index0 and it is correct, we get a check. If it is present but wrong position? Then we know it's in the word? We already know that? So it won't help? Actually, no: if we get a minus for A at index0, we know that A is in the word (we already know) but not at index0? So narrowing down.

 Similarly for index1.

 But also, we want to test new letters? So let's compare the sets:

 ""ABOUT"": tests B, O, U, T? All new.
 ""PATIO"": tests P, T, I, O? And A? Also new letters: P, T, I, O? Note that T and O are in ""ABOUT"", but ""ABOUT"" also has B and U? Both are equally good?

 However, ""ABOUT"" and ""PATIO"" both test 4 new letters? Actually, no: they share T and O? Actually, ""ABOUT"": letters [A, B, O, U, T] -> new: B, O, U, T. Also A? But we already know A? So effectively 4 new.

 Similarly, ""PATIO"": letters [P, A, T, I, O] -> new: P, T, I, O? We haven't tested T? Actually, we haven't tested T? Yes? So both are 4 new.

 But note: we are testing A again? Yes? Because we need to check its position? And we are forced to include A.

 Let me check ""AUDIO"": [A, U, D, I, O] -> new: U, D, I, O? Also 4 new.

 Which vowel combinations? Both are fine? What about consonants? 

 Let's think about frequency: in English, T is very common? So testing T might be good. Also, O is common.

 Actually, among the new letters: B, O, U, T, P, I, D? 

 We don't have much preference? But note: we have a constraint on A: it must be in one of the positions: 0,1,3,4? In ""ABOUT"", we test A at position0? If we get a minus, we know A is not at 0? Similarly for the letters in the other positions.

 So I think any of these words is acceptable.

 Let me go with ""ABOUT""? It tests A at position0? We haven't tried position0? So that could be beneficial? If we get a minus for A at position0, we rule it out? Then A must be in 1,3, or 4? 

 Alternatively, ""PATIO"" tests A at position1? 

 But note: in the secret word, A might be at position0? Then why not test position0? 

 So that makes sense? 

 Therefore, I'll choose ""ABOUT""? 

 Remember: we have to avoid excluded letters: ""ABOUT"" only uses A,B,O,U,T? And none of the excluded C,R,N,E? So good.

 Let me confirm: 
   A at index0: if correct? Will be marked check? If secret has A at a different position? Then marked minus? 
   Similarly, other letters.

 So I will go with ""ABOUT"".

 Alternatively, let me see if there is a word that doesn't have A at index0 or index2? Maybe test a position we haven't tested? We have tested index2? So ideally, we test index0,1,3,4? 

 How about testing A at index1? ""PATIO"" does that? So that's also good? Actually, both positions (0 and 1) are equally unknown.

 However, I recall that A is more common in the second position? For example, in 5-letter words? But no? Actually, no such bias? 

 So I'll pick ""ABOUT"" arbitrarily.

 But wait: what about the word ""SALAD""? It would test A at index1 and index3? But we are not forced to test multiple positions? Actually, that might be inefficient because we are using an extra A? And we only have 6 guesses? So probably better to test one A and many other letters.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""ABOUT"".

 Guess: ""ABOUT""

<guess>about</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- C, R, N, E are confirmed **absent** (x).
- A is present but not in position 2 (index 3 of the word, since indexing starts at 0). 
  
For the next guess, I need a word:
1. Includes A (in position 0, 1, 3, or 4).
2. Excludes C, R, N, E.
3. Uses new common letters (e.g., T, O, U, B, P, I) to maximize information gain.

Choosing **""about""**:
- Tests A at position 0 (new position).
- Introduces B, O, U, T (common letters not yet tested).
- Valid 5-letter word avoiding excluded letters.

This guess efficiently narrows down the position of A and checks new high-frequency letters.

<guess>about</guess>",about,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":

 Instead, what about ""PAINT""? N is excluded? We cannot use N.

 Let me think: ""SLATE"" is not possible because E is excluded.

 How about ""BASIC""? Well, C is excluded? C is absent -> we cannot use C? But C is excluded? So no.

 Another: ""ABOUT"": A at index0? That's allowed: A(0), B(1), O(2), U(3), T(4). Letters: A, B, O, U, T. None of C, R, N, E? So it's valid.

 Also, ""ABOUT"" uses common vowels and consonants? Yes.

 Additionally, it uses B, O, U, T? We haven't checked these.

 Alternatively, ""ADIEU"" is not allowed because E is excluded.

 So ""ABOUT"" seems a good candidate.

 But note: what about ""AUDIO""? That has A at index0? A(0), U(1), D(2), I(3), O(4). Also, avoids excluded letters? Yes? It has D and I? And we avoid C, R, N, E? So yes.

 Let's compare:

 ""ABOUT"" vs ""AUDIO"": both contain A at index0, but which gives more information?

 We know the secret word has A? So in either word, we are testing:

 For ""ABOUT"": 
   Position0: A -> if it's correct we get check, if wrong we know A is not at 0? And similarly for the other letters.

 For ""AUDIO"": also tests U, D, I, O.

 But note: vowels are often in words? However, we already know that the secret contains A? Let's not forget that.

 I think both are acceptable.

 Another candidate: ""PATIO""? That has A at index1: P, A, T, I, O? That's also good? And it doesn't use excluded letters? Yes.

 Comparison of letters:

 ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T
 ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O
 ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O

 Which one? They all test A in a different position? Actually, ""ABOUT"" tests A at position0, ""PATIO"" tests A at position1, and ""AUDIO"" tests A at position0.

 Since we have no information about where A is (except that it's not at index2), testing A at a different position might be beneficial? We have already tested index2? So let's try index0 or index1?

 How about testing A in a position we haven't tested? Currently we only know about index2? So index0,1,3,4 are untested? We can choose any.

 Let me think: if we put A at index0 and it is correct, we get a check. If it is present but wrong position? Then we know it's in the word? We already know that? So it won't help? Actually, no: if we get a minus for A at index0, we know that A is in the word (we already know) but not at index0? So narrowing down.

 Similarly for index1.

 But also, we want to test new letters? So let's compare the sets:

 ""ABOUT"": tests B, O, U, T? All new.
 ""PATIO"": tests P, T, I, O? And A? Also new letters: P, T, I, O? Note that T and O are in ""ABOUT"", but ""ABOUT"" also has B and U? Both are equally good?

 However, ""ABOUT"" and ""PATIO"" both test 4 new letters? Actually, no: they share T and O? Actually, ""ABOUT"": letters [A, B, O, U, T] -> new: B, O, U, T. Also A? But we already know A? So effectively 4 new.

 Similarly, ""PATIO"": letters [P, A, T, I, O] -> new: P, T, I, O? We haven't tested T? Actually, we haven't tested T? Yes? So both are 4 new.

 But note: we are testing A again? Yes? Because we need to check its position? And we are forced to include A.

 Let me check ""AUDIO"": [A, U, D, I, O] -> new: U, D, I, O? Also 4 new.

 Which vowel combinations? Both are fine? What about consonants? 

 Let's think about frequency: in English, T is very common? So testing T might be good. Also, O is common.

 Actually, among the new letters: B, O, U, T, P, I, D? 

 We don't have much preference? But note: we have a constraint on A: it must be in one of the positions: 0,1,3,4? In ""ABOUT"", we test A at position0? If we get a minus, we know A is not at 0? Similarly for the letters in the other positions.

 So I think any of these words is acceptable.

 Let me go with ""ABOUT""? It tests A at position0? We haven't tried position0? So that could be beneficial? If we get a minus for A at position0, we rule it out? Then A must be in 1,3, or 4? 

 Alternatively, ""PATIO"" tests A at position1? 

 But note: in the secret word, A might be at position0? Then why not test position0? 

 So that makes sense? 

 Therefore, I'll choose ""ABOUT""? 

 Remember: we have to avoid excluded letters: ""ABOUT"" only uses A,B,O,U,T? And none of the excluded C,R,N,E? So good.

 Let me confirm: 
   A at index0: if correct? Will be marked check? If secret has A at a different position? Then marked minus? 
   Similarly, other letters.

 So I will go with ""ABOUT"".

 Alternatively, let me see if there is a word that doesn't have A at index0 or index2? Maybe test a position we haven't tested? We have tested index2? So ideally, we test index0,1,3,4? 

 How about testing A at index1? ""PATIO"" does that? So that's also good? Actually, both positions (0 and 1) are equally unknown.

 However, I recall that A is more common in the second position? For example, in 5-letter words? But no? Actually, no such bias? 

 So I'll pick ""ABOUT"" arbitrarily.

 But wait: what about the word ""SALAD""? It would test A at index1 and index3? But we are not forced to test multiple positions? Actually, that might be inefficient because we are using an extra A? And we only have 6 guesses? So probably better to test one A and many other letters.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""ABOUT"".

 Guess: ""ABOUT""

<guess>about</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- C, R, N, E are confirmed **absent** (x).
- A is present but not in position 2 (index 3 of the word, since indexing starts at 0). 
  
For the next guess, I need a word:
1. Includes A (in position 0, 1, 3, or 4).
2. Excludes C, R, N, E.
3. Uses new common letters (e.g., T, O, U, B, P, I) to maximize information gain.

Choosing **""about""**:
- Tests A at position 0 (new position).
- Introduces B, O, U, T (common letters not yet tested).
- Valid 5-letter word avoiding excluded letters.

This guess efficiently narrows down the position of A and checks new high-frequency letters.",Guess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(-),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, etc.

 I recall that ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning the accumulated earnings of a company) and it uses common letters. However, let me check if it's valid.
 Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is a very common starting word.

 But note: the problem says the word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

 Another good one is ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.

 However, I think ""SLATE"" is also a top choice. It has S, L, A, T, E.

 Since we are at the first guess, any of these would be fine.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it covers 5 common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(-) -> A is in the word but not in the position we guessed (position 3 in ""crane"").
 N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.
 E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word does not contain C, R, N, E.
 - It does contain the letter A, but not in the third position.

 Since the secret word is 5 letters and contains A, but not in position 3 (index 2, if we start counting at 0), then A must be in one of the positions: 0, 1, 3, or 4.

 We also know that the letters C, R, N, E are absent. So we avoid these.

 For the next guess, we need:
 - A 5-letter word that includes the letter A (in a position other than the third) and excludes C, R, N, E.
 - We want to test other common letters and try to cover additional letters.

 Let's think of common letters that haven't been tested yet. Remaining frequent letters: T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 We also note that the word must have A in either position 0, 1, 3, or 4.

 Possible strategy: choose a word that has A in a different position and uses other common consonants and vowels.

 Example possibilities:
 - Place A in position 0: words like ""AUDIO"", ""ABOUT"" but note that we cannot use R (in ""ABOUT"", R is absent? Actually, we don't have R because R is excluded). Let's check our constraints.

 But wait: we have to avoid C, R, N, E. So:
 - ""ABOUT"": contains B, O, U, T. And A at position 0. Also, it doesn't contain C, R, N, E? It has A: yes, but we must check the letters: A, B, O, U, T. So R, C, N, E are absent -> acceptable.

 - Alternatively, place A at position 1: words like ""SALAD"" but that has repeated A? Also, L is allowed and common. But note: we don't have constraints on repeated letters? However, the feedback didn't show double A so we don't know if the secret has repeated letters. But ""SALAD"" has two A's? Actually, ""SALAD"" isn't 5 unique letters? Let me think: we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Considering the above, let's try to choose a word with:
   - A in a position that isn't 2, and not 2 (which we already know) but also avoid position 3? We don't know, so we can put it in any of {0,1,3,4}.
   - Also include other common vowels and consonants: T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 However, note the feedback for A: we got a minus, meaning it's in the word but in a different position. So we don't know where exactly.

 Let me try to consider: the secret word has A, and we don't have any other known letters? So let's try to cover more ground.

 Another candidate: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T. A is at position 2? Wait, position 2 is the third character -> that wouldn't work because we know A isn't at position 2? Actually, the third position in the word is index 2 (if 0-indexed: positions 0,1,2,3,4). So in ""crane"", A was at index 2. Therefore, we must place A at index 0,1,3, or 4.

 In ""PLAIT"", if we break it down:
   P (0), L (1), A (2) -> index 2 is not allowed? Actually, we cannot put A at index 2 because we know that in the secret word A is not at index 2. Therefore, we must choose a word where A is at a different index.

 ""PLAIT"" is invalid for our purpose because it has A at index 2.

 Let me think of another word: ""TABLE""? But E is excluded -> we cannot use E.

 ""TABBY""? But Y is a possibility. However, we want to avoid excluded letters: E is excluded, so we cannot use E. Also ""TABBY"" has B twice? Also, A is at index 1: that's allowed.

 But wait, ""TABBY"": T(0), A(1), B(2), B(3), Y(4). We are using A at index 1, which is acceptable. However, we have repeated B? We don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. But it's okay to guess repeated letters? However, we are limited by the fact that we must avoid C, R, N, E.

 Alternatively, we could use ""AVAIL""? But then we have V and two A's? And V is less common. Also, we are avoiding R? The word ""AVAIL"" doesn't have R, C, N, E? So allowed. But our goal is to cover new letters.

 Let me try to find a word that doesn't have A at index 2 and uses common letters.

 Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

 How about ""SALAD""? But that has two A's? Still, A at index 1 and 3? Also, it has L and D. But let's write: S(0), A(1), L(2), A(3), D(4). So A appears at index 1 (which is allowed) and index 3 (which is also allowed). But we don't know if the secret word has two A's? We can use it.

 But note: the feedback doesn't tell us if a letter appears more than once, unless we get multiple minuses or checks? Actually, the feedback per letter: if we guess two A's and there is one A in the secret, we might get one minus and one x? So it's okay to try.

 However, let's choose a more efficient word: a word that uses five new distinct letters including A? But A is required.

 We know A must be in the word, so we can choose a word that has A and four letters we haven't tried.

 Let me think: ""PLANT"" is not good because N is excluded? We cannot use N.

 How about ""PLAIT"" but we cannot use A at index 2? So we skip.

 Alternative: ""PASTA"" -> P, A, S, T, A -> two A's? But A at index 1 and 4? Actually, positions: index0: P, index1: A (allowed), index2: S, index3: T, index4: A (allowed). And no E, R, C, N? Actually, we are excluding C, R, N, E -> so P, A, S, T are okay? The word is valid.

 But let me check if ""PASTA"" is a valid English word? Yes.

 However, we haven't tried S, T, and P? That's good.

 Alternatively, ""TOAST"" -> but has T and O, but S. However, ""TOAST"" contains T twice? And A at index 2? Wait, index0:T, index1:O, index2:A? We cannot put A at index 2? So invalid.

 Instead, what about ""PAINT""? N is excluded? We cannot use N.

 Let me think: ""SLATE"" is not possible because E is excluded.

 How about ""BASIC""? Well, C is excluded? C is absent -> we cannot use C? But C is excluded? So no.

 Another: ""ABOUT"": A at index0? That's allowed: A(0), B(1), O(2), U(3), T(4). Letters: A, B, O, U, T. None of C, R, N, E? So it's valid.

 Also, ""ABOUT"" uses common vowels and consonants? Yes.

 Additionally, it uses B, O, U, T? We haven't checked these.

 Alternatively, ""ADIEU"" is not allowed because E is excluded.

 So ""ABOUT"" seems a good candidate.

 But note: what about ""AUDIO""? That has A at index0? A(0), U(1), D(2), I(3), O(4). Also, avoids excluded letters? Yes? It has D and I? And we avoid C, R, N, E? So yes.

 Let's compare:

 ""ABOUT"" vs ""AUDIO"": both contain A at index0, but which gives more information?

 We know the secret word has A? So in either word, we are testing:

 For ""ABOUT"": 
   Position0: A -> if it's correct we get check, if wrong we know A is not at 0? And similarly for the other letters.

 For ""AUDIO"": also tests U, D, I, O.

 But note: vowels are often in words? However, we already know that the secret contains A? Let's not forget that.

 I think both are acceptable.

 Another candidate: ""PATIO""? That has A at index1: P, A, T, I, O? That's also good? And it doesn't use excluded letters? Yes.

 Comparison of letters:

 ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T
 ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O
 ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O

 Which one? They all test A in a different position? Actually, ""ABOUT"" tests A at position0, ""PATIO"" tests A at position1, and ""AUDIO"" tests A at position0.

 Since we have no information about where A is (except that it's not at index2), testing A at a different position might be beneficial? We have already tested index2? So let's try index0 or index1?

 How about testing A in a position we haven't tested? Currently we only know about index2? So index0,1,3,4 are untested? We can choose any.

Actually, no: if we get a minus for A at index0, we know that A is in the word (we already know) but not at index0? So narrowing down.

 Similarly for index1.

 But also, we want to test new letters? So let's compare the sets:

 ""ABOUT"": tests B, O, U, T? All new.
 ""PATIO"": tests P, T, I, O? And A? Also new letters: P, T, I, O? Note that T and O are in ""ABOUT"", but ""ABOUT"" also has B and U? Both are equally good?

 However, ""ABOUT"" and ""PATIO"" both test 4 new letters? Actually, no: they share T and O? Actually, ""ABOUT"": letters [A, B, O, U, T] -> new: B, O, U, T. Also A? But we already know A? So effectively 4 new.

 Similarly, ""PATIO"": letters [P, A, T, I, O] -> new: P, T, I, O? We haven't tested T? Actually, we haven't tested T? Yes? So both are 4 new.

 But note: we are testing A again? Yes? Because we need to check its position? And we are forced to include A.

 Let me check ""AUDIO"": [A, U, D, I, O] -> new: U, D, I, O? Also 4 new.

 Which vowel combinations? Both are fine? What about consonants? 

 Let's think about frequency: in English, T is very common? So testing T might be good. Also, O is common.

 Actually, among the new letters: B, O, U, T, P, I, D?

 So I think any of these words is acceptable.

 Let me confirm: 
   A at index0: if correct? Will be marked check? If secret has A at a different position? Then marked minus? 
   Similarly, other letters.

 So I will go with ""ABOUT"".

 Alternatively, let me see if there is a word that doesn't have A at index0 or index2? Maybe test a position we haven't tested? We have tested index2? So ideally, we test index0,1,3,4? 

 How about testing A at index1? ""PATIO"" does that? So that's also good? Actually, both positions (0 and 1) are equally unknown.

 However, I recall that A is more common in the second position? For example, in 5-letter words? But no? Actually, no such bias? 

 So I'll pick ""ABOUT"" arbitrarily.

 But wait: what about the word ""SALAD""? It would test A at index1 and index3? But we are not forced to test multiple positions? Actually, that might be inefficient because we are using an extra A? And we only have 6 guesses? So probably better to test one A and many other letters.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""ABOUT"".

But E is excluded -> we cannot use E.\n\n ""TABBY""? But Y is a possibility. However, we want to avoid excluded letters: E is excluded, so we cannot use E. Also ""TABBY"" has B twice? Also, A is at index 1: that\'s allowed.\n\n But wait, ""TABBY"": T(0), A(1), B(2), B(3), Y(4). We are using A at index 1, which is acceptable. However, we have repeated B? We don\'t know if the secret word has repeated letters. But it\'s okay to guess repeated letters? However, we are limited by the fact that we must avoid C, R, N, E.\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""AVAIL""? But then we have V and two A\'s? And V is less common. Also, we are avoiding R? The word ""AVAIL"" doesn\'t have R, C, N, E? So allowed. But our goal is to cover new letters.\n\n Let me try to find a word that doesn\'t have A at index 2 and uses common letters.\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.\n\n How about ""SALAD""? But that has two A\'s? Still, A at index 1 and 3? Also, it has L and D. But let\'s write: S(0), A(1), L(2), A(3), D(4). So A appears at index 1 (which is allowed) and index 3 (which is also allowed). But we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s? We can use it.\n\n But note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us if a letter appears more than once, unless we get multiple minuses or checks? Actually, the feedback per letter: if we guess two A\'s and there is one A in the secret, we might get one minus and one x? So it\'s okay to try.\n\n However, let\'s choose a more efficient word: a word that uses five new distinct letters including A? But A is required.\n\n We know A must be in the word, so we can choose a word that has A and four letters we haven\'t tried.\n\n Let me think: ""PLANT"" is not good because N is excluded? We cannot use N.\n\n How about ""PLAIT"" but we cannot use A at index 2? So we skip.\n\n Alternative: ""PASTA"" -> P, A, S, T, A -> two A\'s? But A at index 1 and 4? Actually, positions: index0: P, index1: A (allowed), index2: S, index3: T, index4: A (allowed). And no E, R, C, N? Actually, we are excluding C, R, N, E -> so P, A, S, T are okay? The word is valid.\n\n But let me check if ""PASTA"" is a valid English word? Yes.\n\n However, we haven\'t tried S, T, and P? That\'s good.\n\n Alternatively, ""TOAST"" -> but has T and O, but S. However, ""TOAST"" contains T twice? And A at index 2? Wait, index0:T, index1:O, index2:A? We cannot put A at index 2? So invalid.\n\n Instead, what about ""PAINT""? N is excluded? We cannot use N.\n\n Let me think: ""SLATE"" is not possible because E is excluded.\n\n How about ""BASIC""? Well, C is excluded? C is absent -> we cannot use C? But C is excluded? So no.\n\n Another: ""ABOUT"": A at index0? That\'s allowed: A(0), B(1), O(2), U(3), T(4). Letters: A, B, O, U, T. None of C, R, N, E? So it\'s valid.\n\n Also, ""ABOUT"" uses common vowels and consonants? Yes.\n\n Additionally, it uses B, O, U, T? We haven\'t checked these.\n\n Alternatively, ""ADIEU"" is not allowed because E is excluded.\n\n So ""ABOUT"" seems a good candidate.\n\n But note: what about ""AUDIO""? That has A at index0? A(0), U(1), D(2), I(3), O(4). Also, avoids excluded letters? Yes? It has D and I? And we avoid C, R, N, E? So yes.\n\n Let\'s compare:\n\n ""ABOUT"" vs ""AUDIO"": both contain A at index0, but which gives more information?\n\n We know the secret word has A? So in either word, we are testing:\n\n For ""ABOUT"": \n   Position0: A -> if it\'s correct we get check, if wrong we know A is not at 0? And similarly for the other letters.\n\n For ""AUDIO"": also tests U, D, I, O.\n\n But note: vowels are often in words? However, we already know that the secret contains A? Let\'s not forget that.\n\n I think both are acceptable.\n\n Another candidate: ""PATIO""? That has A at index1: P, A, T, I, O? That\'s also good? And it doesn\'t use excluded letters? Yes.\n\n Comparison of letters:\n\n ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T\n ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O\n ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O\n\n Which one? They all test A in a different position? Actually, ""ABOUT"" tests A at position0, ""PATIO"" tests A at position1, and ""AUDIO"" tests A at position0.\n\n Since we have no information about where A is (except that it\'s not at index2), testing A at a different position might be beneficial? We have already tested index2? So let\'s try index0 or index1?\n\n How about testing A in a position we haven\'t tested? Currently we only know about index2? So index0,1,3,4 are untested? We can choose any.\n\n Let me think: if we put A at index0 and it is correct, we get a check. If it is present but wrong position? Then we know it\'s in the word? We already know that? So it won\'t help? Actually, no: if we get a minus for A at index0, we know that A is in the word (we already know) but not at index0? So narrowing down.\n\n Similarly for index1.\n\n But also, we want to test new letters? So let\'s compare the sets:\n\n ""ABOUT"": tests B, O, U, T? All new.\n ""PATIO"": tests P, T, I, O? And A? Also new letters: P, T, I, O? Note that T and O are in ""ABOUT"", but ""ABOUT"" also has B and U? Both are equally good?\n\n However, ""ABOUT"" and ""PATIO"" both test 4 new letters? Actually, no: they share T and O? Actually, ""ABOUT"": letters [A, B, O, U, T] -> new: B, O, U, T. Also A? But we already know A? So effectively 4 new.\n\n Similarly, ""PATIO"": letters [P, A, T, I, O] -> new: P, T, I, O? We haven\'t tested T? Actually, we haven\'t tested T? Yes? So both are 4 new.\n\n But note: we are testing A again? Yes? Because we need to check its position? And we are forced to include A.\n\n Let me check ""AUDIO"": [A, U, D, I, O] -> new: U, D, I, O? Also 4 new.\n\n Which vowel combinations? Both are fine? What about consonants? \n\n Let\'s think about frequency: in English, T is very common? So testing T might be good. Also, O is common.\n\n Actually, among the new letters: B, O, U, T, P, I, D? \n\n We don\'t have much preference? But note: we have a constraint on A: it must be in one of the positions: 0,1,3,4? In ""ABOUT"", we test A at position0? If we get a minus, we know A is not at 0? Similarly for the letters in the other positions.\n\n So I think any of these words is acceptable.\n\n Let me go with ""ABOUT""? It tests A at position0? We haven\'t tried position0? So that could be beneficial? If we get a minus for A at position0, we rule it out? Then A must be in 1,3, or 4? \n\n Alternatively, ""PATIO"" tests A at position1? \n\n But note: in the secret word, A might be at position0? Then why not test position0? \n\n So that makes sense? \n\n Therefore, I\'ll choose ""ABOUT""? \n\n Remember: we have to avoid excluded letters: ""ABOUT"" only uses A,B,O,U,T? And none of the excluded C,R,N,E? So good.\n\n Let me confirm: \n   A at index0: if correct? Will be marked check? If secret has A at a different position? Then marked minus? \n   Similarly, other letters.\n\n So I will go with ""ABOUT"".\n\n Alternatively, let me see if there is a word that doesn\'t have A at index0 or index2? Maybe test a position we haven\'t tested? We have tested index2? So ideally, we test index0,1,3,4? \n\n How about testing A at index1? ""PATIO"" does that? So that\'s also good? Actually, both positions (0 and 1) are equally unknown.\n\n However, I recall that A is more common in the second position? For example, in 5-letter words? But no? Actually, no such bias? \n\n So I\'ll pick ""ABOUT"" arbitrarily.\n\n But wait: what about the word ""SALAD""? It would test A at index1 and index3? But we are not forced to test multiple positions? Actually, that might be inefficient because we are using an extra A? And we only have 6 guesses? So probably better to test one A and many other letters.\n\n Therefore, I\'ll go with ""ABOUT"".\n\n Guess: ""ABOUT""\n\n<guess>about</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": \n- C, R, N, E are confirmed **absent** (x).\n- A is present but not in position 2 (index 3 of the word, since indexing starts at 0). \n  \nFor the next guess, I need a word:\n1. Includes A (in position 0, 1, 3, or 4).\n2. Excludes C, R, N, E.\n3. Uses new common letters (e.g., T, O, U, B, P, I) to maximize information gain.\n\nChoosing **""about""**:\n- Tests A at position 0 (new position).\n- Introduces B, O, U, T (common letters not yet tested).\n- Valid 5-letter word avoiding excluded letters.\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down the position of A and checks new high-frequency letters.\n\n<guess>about</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have two sets of feedback:

1. Guess ""crane"": 
   - C (x) -> absent
   - R (x) -> absent
   - A (-) -> present but not at position 2 (index 2 in zero-based indexing, which is the third character). So A is in the word but not at index 2.
   - N (x) -> absent
   - E (x) -> absent

2. Guess ""about"":
   - A (-) -> present but not at position 0 (index 0). So we now know A is not at index 0 and index 2? Yes.
   - B (x) -> absent
   - O (x) -> absent
   - U (x) -> absent
   - T (-) -> present but not at position 4? ""about"" has T at index 4. So T is in the secret word but not at index 4.

So let's compile the information:

**Absent letters (x):** C, R, N, E, B, O, U 
**Must-include letters (known):** A and T are in the word? Because both have feedback ""-"" meaning they are present.

But note: in both guesses:
- In ""crane"": A is present? Yes (minuses) but not at index 2.
- In ""about"": A is present? Yes (but not at index 0) and T is present? But not at index 4? So T is in the secret word? Yes.

Also note: The word does not contain C, R, N, E, B, O, U.

Therefore, the secret word must contain at least A and T? And must not contain the excluded letters? 

However, we have only identified 2 letters? The word is 5 letters? So there are 3 more? But note: T's presence is confirmed? And A's presence is confirmed? And we have excluded 7 letters? 

But wait: we have 26 letters? We can try to find a word that has A and T? Plus three new letters? Also, we must place A and T correctly? 

From feedback:
- A cannot be at index 0 (from ""about"") and index 2 (from ""crane"")? So possible positions for A: only index 1, 3, or 4? 
- T cannot be at index 4? From ""about""? Also, we don't know about T? So T could be at indices: 0, 1, 2, 3? But not 4? 

Now, we need to choose a new guess that:
- Must include both A and T? Because they are known to be in the word? 
- Must exclude C, R, N, E, B, O, U? 
- Also, we have to consider positions: A cannot be at index0 or index2? T cannot be at index4? 

So A must be at position: 1, 3, or 4? 
T must be at position: 0,1,2,3? 

Possible next guess: we can try a word that has A and T? And try to test a position for A? And also try other common letters? 

Also, we haven't tried letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

We want to pick a word that uses A and T? And three new letters? Also, we should place A at one of the possible positions: 1,3,4? Similarly T at any position except 4? And verify it doesn't have any excluded letter? 

But note: we haven't detected any double letters? But it's possible? 

We can try to cover common letters: for example, S, L, I, D, M, etc? 

Candidate words? 

First, with A at a new possible position? Let's try A at index1: for example? Or index3? 

But we don't know? So we might want to test a position? And also test new letters? 

For example: 
- How about ""SALTY""? But S? and L? But we must exclude O? We don't have excluded? But O is excluded? So we cannot use O? ""SALTY"" has O? Wait, no? SALTY: S, A, L, T, Y? 

But check excluded? O is excluded? But ""SALTY"" doesn't have O? So it's okay? 

But wait: we also must not use: C,R,N,E,B,O,U? So ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y -> none are excluded? So it's valid? 

In ""SALTY"":
- A is at index1?
- T is at index3? 

Also, S, L, Y are new letters? 

But positions:
If we pick ""SALTY"":
   Index0: S
   Index1: A? -> now, we know A cannot be at index1? Or we test it: if correct, we get check? If not, then we know A isn't at index1? So we narrow? 

Similarly T: at index3? Which is allowed? 

We also get to test S at index0? L at index2? Y at index4? 

But note: the feedback for T? We have T? Already? So we can see if T is placed correctly at index3? Or elsewhere? 

But wait: we know T is present? But not at index4? Now we are testing T at index3? So we might get information? 

So ""SALTY"" is possible? 

But note: what about the secret word? It might have T at other positions? 

Alternative: perhaps ""PATSY""? But P? And S? But A at index1? T at index2? And S? And Y? 

But no excluded letters? 

""PATSY"": P, A, T, S, Y? 

That also: 
- A at index1? 
- T at index2? 

But we haven't tried index2 for T? It's possible? 

However, note: for A? We haven't tried index1? So both words test A at index1? 

But ""SALTY""? Also tests L? And Y? Which are good? 

But let me see? Another candidate: ""TASTY""? But T repeated? We have two T's? And A at index1? T at index0 and index3? 

But we don't have issue? 

We will consider? 

However, our goal? We don't know if there are repeated letters? 

But we can choose? 

But note: ""SALTY"" and ""PATSY"" are both candidates? 

Also ""DAISY""? But D? A? I? S? Y? But A in ""DAISY"" is at index1? But also excludes? We don't have excluded? 

But wait: ""DAISY""? Actually, D(0), A(1), I(2), S(3), Y(4). 

But we just want to test A at index1? 

But note: we know T must be in the word? And ""DAISY"" does not have T? So we must include T? 

Therefore, we cannot guess ""DAISY""? Because we know the word must contain T? And ""DAISY"" doesn't have T? So that would be invalid? 

Similarly, our guess must include A? We know A is in the word? And must include T? 

So we have to include both? 

Therefore, words without T are invalid? 

So ""SALTY"" has T? Yes. 
""PATSY"" has T? Yes? 

What are other possibilities? 

How about ""MATCH""? But C? Excluded? 

How about ""PASTA""? But E excluded? No? But P, A, S, T, A? Has S and T? But A repeated? Also, O? No? But O is excluded? In PASTA? No? But we don't have O? It has P, A, S, T, A? 

But A at index1 and index4? 

But ""PASTA"": index0:P, index1:A, index2:S, index3:T, index4:A? 

And excluded: we must avoid C,R,N,E,B,O,U? So:
P: ok
A: ok
S: ok
T: ok
A: ok? 

But the excluded list: we have to avoid C,R,N,E,B,O,U? So ""PASTA"" uses P, A, S, T? No excluded letters? 

So ""PASTA"" is acceptable? 

In ""PASTA"": 
- A? At index1 and 4? We test A at index1 and index4? 
- T? At index3? 

But we are testing A and T? Plus S and P? 

But note: if we guess ""PASTA"", and if A is only once in the secret? We might get one minus and one x? So that narrows? 

Similarly, we haven't tested S or P? 

But let's compare ""SALTY"" and ""PASTA"": 

- ""SALTY"": letters used: S, A, L, T, Y? 
- ""PASTA"": letters used: P, A, S, T, A? So testing P and S? And also L? But ""SALTY"" tests Y? 

We haven't tested L? So SALTY tests L? PASTA tests P and S? 

We haven't tested S? 

But note: we also haven't tested P? 

But S is more common? 

However, both are acceptable? 

Let me think: we know A is in one of the positions 1,3,4? 

In ""SALTY"", we test A at position1? Which is one candidate? 
In ""PASTA"", we test A at positions1 and also4? 

But we have two A's? Might be wasteful? 

So? 

Alternatively, what about ""TAILS""? But A at index1? And T at index0? 

""TAILS"": T(0), A(1), I(2), L(3), S(4)? 

But then T? At index0? And S? And I, L? 

But we haven't excluded I,L,S? 

Also, T? We know T is in the word? 

But in ""TAILS"": T at index0? We haven't tested that position? So if T? At index0? 

Also, A at index1? 

So ""TAILS"" tests T at index0? And A at index1? Both? 

Similarly? 

And L at index3? S at index4? 

We also avoid excluded? 

So let me choose between ""SALTY"", ""PATSY"", ""PASTA"", ""TAILS""? 

""PATSY"": P, A, T, S, Y? Also? 

But let me list:

- ""SALTY"": S(0), A(1), L(2), T(3), Y(4) -> tests A at position1? And T at position3? 

- ""PATSY"": P(0), A(1), T(2), S(3), Y(4) -> tests A at position1? T at position2? 

- ""TAILS"": T(0), A(1), I(2), L(3), S(4) -> tests A at position1? T at position0? 

- ""PASTA"": P(0), A(1), S(2), T(3), A(4) -> tests A at positions1 and4? T at position3? 

Now note: in the secret word, T cannot be at index4? But we already tested T at index4? So excluding that position? 

We want to test T at new positions? 

Similarly, A? 

In ""TAILS"": T at index0? We haven't tested T at index0? So we can get whether T is at that position? 

Similarly, in ""PATSY"": T at index2? 

So? 

Also, common letters: S, L, T? 

I'll pick ""TAILS"" for the next guess? Why? 

Because we test T at a new position (index0)? We haven't tested T at index0? Or index1? Or index2? Or index3? Only excluded index4? 

So testing index0 might be useful? 

Similarly, A at index1? 

In ""TAILS""? 

We are offering I and L? Which are vowels? But consonants also? 

It includes five new letters: T, A, I, L, S? But T and A are known? So effectively testing I, L, S? 

So ""TAILS"" 

Therefore? 

Guess: ""tails""? 

But note: T at index0 and A at index1? 

We then expect feedback: either T might be correct? Or A? Or both? 

Also, we might get minuses? 

We can then use that information? 

So decided: ""TAILS"" 

Confirm: ""tails"" is a valid English word? It means the hindmost part of an animal? Or to follow? But in plural? Yes, as a noun? 

Also, in Wordle? It would be accepted? 

So <guess>tails</guess> 

But note: we have to write the guess? 

But let me think? 

Alternatively, ""STAIN""? But N? Excluded? Cannot. 

Therefore, I'll proceed with ""tails"". 

<guess>tails</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback:
- **Absent letters (x):** C, R, N, E, B, O, U  
  → Excluded from future guesses.
- **Confirmed present letters:** A and T are in the secret word.  
  - **A:** Not at position 0 (from ""about"") or position 2 (from ""crane"").  
  - **T:** Not at position 4 (from ""about"").
- **Possible positions:**  
  - **A:** Must be at index 1, 3, or 4 (0-based).  
  - **T:** Must be at index 0, 1, 2, or 3 (not 4).

For the next guess, the word must:
1. Include **A** and **T** (since they are confirmed present).
2. Exclude the absent letters (C, R, N, E, B, O, U).
3. Test new high-frequency letters (not yet attempted), such as S, L, I, D, G, H.
4. Ideally, position **A** at an untested position (1, 3, or 4) and **T** at an untested position (0, 1, 2, or 3) to gather more information.

Chosen guess: **""tails""**  
- Composition: T (index 0), A (index 1), I (index 2), L (index 3), S (index 4).  
- Why this word?  
  - Tests **A** at the new position 1 (previously untested positions were 0 and 2).  
  - Tests **T** at the new position 0 (only position 4 has been tested).  
  - Introduces new common letters: I, L, S (all untested and high-frequency).  
  - Avoids excluded letters.  
- Potential outcomes:  
  - If **A** is at position 1, feedback will show ✓.  
  - If **T** is at position 0, feedback will show ✓.  
  - Otherwise, minuses will help narrow positions for A/T while confirming other letters in the word.

This guess efficiently narrows possible positions for A and T while covering new letters.

<guess>tails</guess>",tails,"We have two sets of feedback:

1. Guess ""crane"": 
   - C (x) -> absent
   - R (x) -> absent
   - A (-) -> present but not at position 2 (index 2 in zero-based indexing, which is the third character). So A is in the word but not at index 2.
   - N (x) -> absent
   - E (x) -> absent

2. Guess ""about"":
   - A (-) -> present but not at position 0 (index 0). So we now know A is not at index 0 and index 2? Yes.
   - B (x) -> absent
   - O (x) -> absent
   - U (x) -> absent
   - T (-) -> present but not at position 4? ""about"" has T at index 4. So T is in the secret word but not at index 4.

So let's compile the information:

**Absent letters (x):** C, R, N, E, B, O, U 
**Must-include letters (known):** A and T are in the word? Because both have feedback ""-"" meaning they are present.

But note: in both guesses:
- In ""crane"": A is present? Yes (minuses) but not at index 2.
- In ""about"": A is present? Yes (but not at index 0) and T is present? But not at index 4? So T is in the secret word? Yes.

Also note: The word does not contain C, R, N, E, B, O, U.

Therefore, the secret word must contain at least A and T? And must not contain the excluded letters? 

However, we have only identified 2 letters? The word is 5 letters? So there are 3 more? But note: T's presence is confirmed? And A's presence is confirmed? And we have excluded 7 letters? 

But wait: we have 26 letters? We can try to find a word that has A and T? Plus three new letters? Also, we must place A and T correctly? 

From feedback:
- A cannot be at index 0 (from ""about"") and index 2 (from ""crane"")? So possible positions for A: only index 1, 3, or 4? 
- T cannot be at index 4? From ""about""? Also, we don't know about T? So T could be at indices: 0, 1, 2, 3? But not 4? 

Now, we need to choose a new guess that:
- Must include both A and T? Because they are known to be in the word? 
- Must exclude C, R, N, E, B, O, U? 
- Also, we have to consider positions: A cannot be at index0 or index2? T cannot be at index4? 

So A must be at position: 1, 3, or 4? 
T must be at position: 0,1,2,3? 

Possible next guess: we can try a word that has A and T? And try to test a position for A? And also try other common letters? 

Also, we haven't tried letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

We want to pick a word that uses A and T? And three new letters? Also, we should place A at one of the possible positions: 1,3,4? Similarly T at any position except 4? And verify it doesn't have any excluded letter? 

But note: we haven't detected any double letters? But it's possible? 

We can try to cover common letters: for example, S, L, I, D, M, etc? 

Candidate words? 

First, with A at a new possible position? Let's try A at index1: for example? Or index3? 

But we don't know? So we might want to test a position? And also test new letters? 

For example: 
- How about ""SALTY""? But S? and L? But we must exclude O? We don't have excluded? But O is excluded? So we cannot use O? ""SALTY"" has O? Wait, no? SALTY: S, A, L, T, Y? 

But check excluded? O is excluded? But ""SALTY"" doesn't have O? So it's okay? 

But wait: we also must not use: C,R,N,E,B,O,U? So ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y -> none are excluded? So it's valid? 

In ""SALTY"":
- A is at index1?
- T is at index3? 

Also, S, L, Y are new letters? 

But positions:
If we pick ""SALTY"":
   Index0: S
   Index1: A? -> now, we know A cannot be at index1? Or we test it: if correct, we get check? If not, then we know A isn't at index1? So we narrow? 

Similarly T: at index3? Which is allowed? 

We also get to test S at index0? L at index2? Y at index4? 

But note: the feedback for T? We have T? Already? So we can see if T is placed correctly at index3? Or elsewhere? 

But wait: we know T is present? But not at index4? Now we are testing T at index3? So we might get information? 

So ""SALTY"" is possible? 

But note: what about the secret word? It might have T at other positions? 

Alternative: perhaps ""PATSY""? But P? And S? But A at index1? T at index2? And S? And Y? 

But no excluded letters? 

""PATSY"": P, A, T, S, Y? 

That also: 
- A at index1? 
- T at index2? 

But we haven't tried index2 for T? It's possible? 

However, note: for A? We haven't tried index1? So both words test A at index1? 

But ""SALTY""? Also tests L? And Y? Which are good? 

But let me see? Another candidate: ""TASTY""? But T repeated? We have two T's? And A at index1? T at index0 and index3? 

But we don't have issue? 

We will consider? 

However, our goal? We don't know if there are repeated letters? 

But we can choose? 

But note: ""SALTY"" and ""PATSY"" are both candidates? 

Also ""DAISY""? But D? A? I? S? Y? But A in ""DAISY"" is at index1? But also excludes? We don't have excluded? 

But wait: ""DAISY""? Actually, D(0), A(1), I(2), S(3), Y(4). 

But we just want to test A at index1? 

But note: we know T must be in the word? And ""DAISY"" does not have T? So we must include T? 

Therefore, we cannot guess ""DAISY""? Because we know the word must contain T? And ""DAISY"" doesn't have T? So that would be invalid? 

Similarly, our guess must include A? We know A is in the word? And must include T? 

So we have to include both? 

Therefore, words without T are invalid? 

So ""SALTY"" has T? Yes. 
""PATSY"" has T? Yes? 

What are other possibilities? 

How about ""MATCH""? But C? Excluded? 

How about ""PASTA""? But E excluded? No? But P, A, S, T, A? Has S and T? But A repeated? Also, O? No? But O is excluded? In PASTA? No? But we don't have O? It has P, A, S, T, A? 

But A at index1 and index4? 

But ""PASTA"": index0:P, index1:A, index2:S, index3:T, index4:A? 

And excluded: we must avoid C,R,N,E,B,O,U? So:
P: ok
A: ok
S: ok
T: ok
A: ok? 

But the excluded list: we have to avoid C,R,N,E,B,O,U? So ""PASTA"" uses P, A, S, T? No excluded letters? 

So ""PASTA"" is acceptable? 

In ""PASTA"": 
- A? At index1 and 4? We test A at index1 and index4? 
- T? At index3? 

But we are testing A and T? Plus S and P? 

But note: if we guess ""PASTA"", and if A is only once in the secret? We might get one minus and one x? So that narrows? 

Similarly, we haven't tested S or P? 

But let's compare ""SALTY"" and ""PASTA"": 

- ""SALTY"": letters used: S, A, L, T, Y? 
- ""PASTA"": letters used: P, A, S, T, A? So testing P and S? And also L? But ""SALTY"" tests Y? 

We haven't tested L? So SALTY tests L? PASTA tests P and S? 

We haven't tested S? 

But note: we also haven't tested P? 

But S is more common? 

However, both are acceptable? 

Let me think: we know A is in one of the positions 1,3,4? 

In ""SALTY"", we test A at position1? Which is one candidate? 
In ""PASTA"", we test A at positions1 and also4? 

But we have two A's? Might be wasteful? 

So? 

Alternatively, what about ""TAILS""? But A at index1? And T at index0? 

""TAILS"": T(0), A(1), I(2), L(3), S(4)? 

But then T? At index0? And S? And I, L? 

But we haven't excluded I,L,S? 

Also, T? We know T is in the word? 

But in ""TAILS"": T at index0? We haven't tested that position? So if T? At index0? 

Also, A at index1? 

So ""TAILS"" tests T at index0? And A at index1? Both? 

Similarly? 

And L at index3? S at index4? 

We also avoid excluded? 

So let me choose between ""SALTY"", ""PATSY"", ""PASTA"", ""TAILS""? 

""PATSY"": P, A, T, S, Y? Also? 

But let me list:

- ""SALTY"": S(0), A(1), L(2), T(3), Y(4) -> tests A at position1? And T at position3? 

- ""PATSY"": P(0), A(1), T(2), S(3), Y(4) -> tests A at position1? T at position2? 

- ""TAILS"": T(0), A(1), I(2), L(3), S(4) -> tests A at position1? T at position0? 

- ""PASTA"": P(0), A(1), S(2), T(3), A(4) -> tests A at positions1 and4? T at position3? 

Now note: in the secret word, T cannot be at index4? But we already tested T at index4? So excluding that position? 

We want to test T at new positions? 

Similarly, A? 

In ""TAILS"": T at index0? We haven't tested T at index0? So we can get whether T is at that position? 

Similarly, in ""PATSY"": T at index2? 

So? 

Also, common letters: S, L, T? 

I'll pick ""TAILS"" for the next guess? Why? 

Because we test T at a new position (index0)? We haven't tested T at index0? Or index1? Or index2? Or index3? Only excluded index4? 

So testing index0 might be useful? 

Similarly, A at index1? 

In ""TAILS""? 

We are offering I and L? Which are vowels? But consonants also? 

It includes five new letters: T, A, I, L, S? But T and A are known? So effectively testing I, L, S? 

So ""TAILS"" 

Therefore? 

Guess: ""tails""? 

But note: T at index0 and A at index1? 

We then expect feedback: either T might be correct? Or A? Or both? 

Also, we might get minuses? 

We can then use that information? 

So decided: ""TAILS"" 

Confirm: ""tails"" is a valid English word? It means the hindmost part of an animal? Or to follow? But in plural? Yes, as a noun? 

Also, in Wordle? It would be accepted? 

So <guess>tails</guess> 

But note: we have to write the guess? 

But let me think? 

Alternatively, ""STAIN""? But N? Excluded? Cannot. 

Therefore, I'll proceed with ""tails"". 

<guess>tails</guess>Based on the feedback:
- **Absent letters (x):** C, R, N, E, B, O, U  
  → Excluded from future guesses.
- **Confirmed present letters:** A and T are in the secret word.  
  - **A:** Not at position 0 (from ""about"") or position 2 (from ""crane"").  
  - **T:** Not at position 4 (from ""about"").
- **Possible positions:**  
  - **A:** Must be at index 1, 3, or 4 (0-based).  
  - **T:** Must be at index 0, 1, 2, or 3 (not 4).

For the next guess, the word must:
1. Include **A** and **T** (since they are confirmed present).
2. Exclude the absent letters (C, R, N, E, B, O, U).
3. Test new high-frequency letters (not yet attempted), such as S, L, I, D, G, H.
4. Ideally, position **A** at an untested position (1, 3, or 4) and **T** at an untested position (0, 1, 2, or 3) to gather more information.

Chosen guess: **""tails""**  
- Composition: T (index 0), A (index 1), I (index 2), L (index 3), S (index 4).  
- Why this word?  
  - Tests **A** at the new position 1 (previously untested positions were 0 and 2).  
  - Tests **T** at the new position 0 (only position 4 has been tested).  
  - Introduces new common letters: I, L, S (all untested and high-frequency).  
  - Avoids excluded letters.  
- Potential outcomes:  
  - If **A** is at position 1, feedback will show ✓.  
  - If **T** is at position 0, feedback will show ✓.  
  - Otherwise, minuses will help narrow positions for A/T while confirming other letters in the word.

This guess efficiently narrows possible positions for A and T while covering new letters.",Guess 3: tails -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(✓) I(x) L(x) S(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,pasty,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, etc.

 I recall that ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning the accumulated earnings of a company) and it uses common letters. However, let me check if it's valid.
 Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is a very common starting word.

 But note: the problem says the word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

 Another good one is ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.

 However, I think ""SLATE"" is also a top choice. It has S, L, A, T, E.

 Since we are at the first guess, any of these would be fine.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it covers 5 common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(-) -> A is in the word but not in the position we guessed (position 3 in ""crane"").
 N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.
 E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word does not contain C, R, N, E.
 - It does contain the letter A, but not in the third position.

 Since the secret word is 5 letters and contains A, but not in position 3 (index 2, if we start counting at 0), then A must be in one of the positions: 0, 1, 3, or 4.

 We also know that the letters C, R, N, E are absent. So we avoid these.

 For the next guess, we need:
 - A 5-letter word that includes the letter A (in a position other than the third) and excludes C, R, N, E.
 - We want to test other common letters and try to cover additional letters.

 Let's think of common letters that haven't been tested yet. Remaining frequent letters: T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 We also note that the word must have A in either position 0, 1, 3, or 4.

 Possible strategy: choose a word that has A in a different position and uses other common consonants and vowels.

 Example possibilities:
 - Place A in position 0: words like ""AUDIO"", ""ABOUT"" but note that we cannot use R (in ""ABOUT"", R is absent? Actually, we don't have R because R is excluded). Let's check our constraints.

 But wait: we have to avoid C, R, N, E. So:
 - ""ABOUT"": contains B, O, U, T. And A at position 0. Also, it doesn't contain C, R, N, E? It has A: yes, but we must check the letters: A, B, O, U, T. So R, C, N, E are absent -> acceptable.

 - Alternatively, place A at position 1: words like ""SALAD"" but that has repeated A? Also, L is allowed and common. But note: we don't have constraints on repeated letters? However, the feedback didn't show double A so we don't know if the secret has repeated letters. But ""SALAD"" has two A's? Actually, ""SALAD"" isn't 5 unique letters? Let me think: we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Considering the above, let's try to choose a word with:
   - A in a position that isn't 2, and not 2 (which we already know) but also avoid position 3? We don't know, so we can put it in any of {0,1,3,4}.
   - Also include other common vowels and consonants: T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 However, note the feedback for A: we got a minus, meaning it's in the word but in a different position. So we don't know where exactly.

 Let me try to consider: the secret word has A, and we don't have any other known letters? So let's try to cover more ground.

 Another candidate: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T. A is at position 2? Wait, position 2 is the third character -> that wouldn't work because we know A isn't at position 2? Actually, the third position in the word is index 2 (if 0-indexed: positions 0,1,2,3,4). So in ""crane"", A was at index 2. Therefore, we must place A at index 0,1,3, or 4.

 In ""PLAIT"", if we break it down:
   P (0), L (1), A (2) -> index 2 is not allowed? Actually, we cannot put A at index 2 because we know that in the secret word A is not at index 2. Therefore, we must choose a word where A is at a different index.

 ""PLAIT"" is invalid for our purpose because it has A at index 2.

 Let me think of another word: ""TABLE""? But E is excluded -> we cannot use E.

 ""TABBY""? But Y is a possibility. However, we want to avoid excluded letters: E is excluded, so we cannot use E. Also ""TABBY"" has B twice? Also, A is at index 1: that's allowed.

 But wait, ""TABBY"": T(0), A(1), B(2), B(3), Y(4). We are using A at index 1, which is acceptable. However, we have repeated B? We don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. But it's okay to guess repeated letters? However, we are limited by the fact that we must avoid C, R, N, E.

 Alternatively, we could use ""AVAIL""? But then we have V and two A's? And V is less common. Also, we are avoiding R? The word ""AVAIL"" doesn't have R, C, N, E? So allowed. But our goal is to cover new letters.

 Let me try to find a word that doesn't have A at index 2 and uses common letters.

 Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

 How about ""SALAD""? But that has two A's? Still, A at index 1 and 3? Also, it has L and D. But let's write: S(0), A(1), L(2), A(3), D(4). So A appears at index 1 (which is allowed) and index 3 (which is also allowed). But we don't know if the secret word has two A's? We can use it.

 But note: the feedback doesn't tell us if a letter appears more than once, unless we get multiple minuses or checks? Actually, the feedback per letter: if we guess two A's and there is one A in the secret, we might get one minus and one x? So it's okay to try.

 However, let's choose a more efficient word: a word that uses five new distinct letters including A? But A is required.

 We know A must be in the word, so we can choose a word that has A and four letters we haven't tried.

 Let me think: ""PLANT"" is not good because N is excluded? We cannot use N.

 How about ""PLAIT"" but we cannot use A at index 2? So we skip.

 Alternative: ""PASTA"" -> P, A, S, T, A -> two A's? But A at index 1 and 4? Actually, positions: index0: P, index1: A (allowed), index2: S, index3: T, index4: A (allowed). And no E, R, C, N? Actually, we are excluding C, R, N, E -> so P, A, S, T are okay? The word is valid.

 But let me check if ""PASTA"" is a valid English word? Yes.

 However, we haven't tried S, T, and P? That's good.

 Alternatively, ""TOAST"" -> but has T and O, but S. However, ""TOAST"" contains T twice? And A at index 2? Wait, index0:T, index1:O, index2:A? We cannot put A at index 2? So invalid.

 Instead, what about ""PAINT""? N is excluded? We cannot use N.

 Let me think: ""SLATE"" is not possible because E is excluded.

 How about ""BASIC""? Well, C is excluded? C is absent -> we cannot use C? But C is excluded? So no.

 Another: ""ABOUT"": A at index0? That's allowed: A(0), B(1), O(2), U(3), T(4). Letters: A, B, O, U, T. None of C, R, N, E? So it's valid.

 Also, ""ABOUT"" uses common vowels and consonants? Yes.

 Additionally, it uses B, O, U, T? We haven't checked these.

 Alternatively, ""ADIEU"" is not allowed because E is excluded.

 So ""ABOUT"" seems a good candidate.

 But note: what about ""AUDIO""? That has A at index0? A(0), U(1), D(2), I(3), O(4). Also, avoids excluded letters? Yes? It has D and I? And we avoid C, R, N, E? So yes.

 Let's compare:

 ""ABOUT"" vs ""AUDIO"": both contain A at index0, but which gives more information?

 We know the secret word has A? So in either word, we are testing:

 For ""ABOUT"": 
   Position0: A -> if it's correct we get check, if wrong we know A is not at 0? And similarly for the other letters.

 For ""AUDIO"": also tests U, D, I, O.

 But note: vowels are often in words? However, we already know that the secret contains A? Let's not forget that.

 I think both are acceptable.

 Another candidate: ""PATIO""? That has A at index1: P, A, T, I, O? That's also good? And it doesn't use excluded letters? Yes.

 Comparison of letters:

 ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T
 ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O
 ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O

 Which one? They all test A in a different position? Actually, ""ABOUT"" tests A at position0, ""PATIO"" tests A at position1, and ""AUDIO"" tests A at position0.

 Since we have no information about where A is (except that it's not at index2), testing A at a different position might be beneficial? We have already tested index2? So let's try index0 or index1?

 How about testing A in a position we haven't tested? Currently we only know about index2? So index0,1,3,4 are untested? We can choose any.

 Let me think: if we put A at index0 and it is correct, we get a check. If it is present but wrong position? Then we know it's in the word? We already know that? So it won't help? Actually, no: if we get a minus for A at index0, we know that A is in the word (we already know) but not at index0? So narrowing down.

 Similarly for index1.

 But also, we want to test new letters? So let's compare the sets:

 ""ABOUT"": tests B, O, U, T? All new.
 ""PATIO"": tests P, T, I, O? And A? Also new letters: P, T, I, O? Note that T and O are in ""ABOUT"", but ""ABOUT"" also has B and U? Both are equally good?

 However, ""ABOUT"" and ""PATIO"" both test 4 new letters? Actually, no: they share T and O? Actually, ""ABOUT"": letters [A, B, O, U, T] -> new: B, O, U, T. Also A? But we already know A? So effectively 4 new.

 Similarly, ""PATIO"": letters [P, A, T, I, O] -> new: P, T, I, O? We haven't tested T? Actually, we haven't tested T? Yes? So both are 4 new.

 But note: we are testing A again? Yes? Because we need to check its position? And we are forced to include A.

 Let me check ""AUDIO"": [A, U, D, I, O] -> new: U, D, I, O? Also 4 new.

 Which vowel combinations? Both are fine? What about consonants? 

 Let's think about frequency: in English, T is very common? So testing T might be good. Also, O is common.

 Actually, among the new letters: B, O, U, T, P, I, D? 

 We don't have much preference? But note: we have a constraint on A: it must be in one of the positions: 0,1,3,4? In ""ABOUT"", we test A at position0? If we get a minus, we know A is not at 0? Similarly for the letters in the other positions.

 So I think any of these words is acceptable.

 Let me go with ""ABOUT""? It tests A at position0? We haven't tried position0? So that could be beneficial? If we get a minus for A at position0, we rule it out? Then A must be in 1,3, or 4? 

 Alternatively, ""PATIO"" tests A at position1? 

 But note: in the secret word, A might be at position0? Then why not test position0? 

 So that makes sense? 

 Therefore, I'll choose ""ABOUT""? 

 Remember: we have to avoid excluded letters: ""ABOUT"" only uses A,B,O,U,T? And none of the excluded C,R,N,E? So good.

 Let me confirm: 
   A at index0: if correct? Will be marked check? If secret has A at a different position? Then marked minus? 
   Similarly, other letters.

 So I will go with ""ABOUT"".

 Alternatively, let me see if there is a word that doesn't have A at index0 or index2? Maybe test a position we haven't tested? We have tested index2? So ideally, we test index0,1,3,4? 

 How about testing A at index1? ""PATIO"" does that? So that's also good? Actually, both positions (0 and 1) are equally unknown.

 However, I recall that A is more common in the second position? For example, in 5-letter words? But no? Actually, no such bias? 

 So I'll pick ""ABOUT"" arbitrarily.

 But wait: what about the word ""SALAD""? It would test A at index1 and index3? But we are not forced to test multiple positions? Actually, that might be inefficient because we are using an extra A? And we only have 6 guesses? So probably better to test one A and many other letters.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""ABOUT"".

 Guess: ""ABOUT""

<guess>about</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- C, R, N, E are confirmed **absent** (x).
- A is present but not in position 2 (index 3 of the word, since indexing starts at 0). 
  
For the next guess, I need a word:
1. Includes A (in position 0, 1, 3, or 4).
2. Excludes C, R, N, E.
3. Uses new common letters (e.g., T, O, U, B, P, I) to maximize information gain.

Choosing **""about""**:
- Tests A at position 0 (new position).
- Introduces B, O, U, T (common letters not yet tested).
- Valid 5-letter word avoiding excluded letters.

This guess efficiently narrows down the position of A and checks new high-frequency letters.

<guess>about</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:

1. Guess ""crane"": 
   - C (x) -> absent
   - R (x) -> absent
   - A (-) -> present but not at position 2 (index 2 in zero-based indexing, which is the third character). So A is in the word but not at index 2.
   - N (x) -> absent
   - E (x) -> absent

2. Guess ""about"":
   - A (-) -> present but not at position 0 (index 0). So we now know A is not at index 0 and index 2? Yes.
   - B (x) -> absent
   - O (x) -> absent
   - U (x) -> absent
   - T (-) -> present but not at position 4? ""about"" has T at index 4. So T is in the secret word but not at index 4.

So let's compile the information:

**Absent letters (x):** C, R, N, E, B, O, U 
**Must-include letters (known):** A and T are in the word? Because both have feedback ""-"" meaning they are present.

But note: in both guesses:
- In ""crane"": A is present? Yes (minuses) but not at index 2.
- In ""about"": A is present? Yes (but not at index 0) and T is present? But not at index 4? So T is in the secret word? Yes.

Also note: The word does not contain C, R, N, E, B, O, U.

Therefore, the secret word must contain at least A and T? And must not contain the excluded letters? 

However, we have only identified 2 letters? The word is 5 letters? So there are 3 more? But note: T's presence is confirmed? And A's presence is confirmed? And we have excluded 7 letters? 

But wait: we have 26 letters? We can try to find a word that has A and T? Plus three new letters? Also, we must place A and T correctly? 

From feedback:
- A cannot be at index 0 (from ""about"") and index 2 (from ""crane"")? So possible positions for A: only index 1, 3, or 4? 
- T cannot be at index 4? From ""about""? Also, we don't know about T? So T could be at indices: 0, 1, 2, 3? But not 4? 

Now, we need to choose a new guess that:
- Must include both A and T? Because they are known to be in the word? 
- Must exclude C, R, N, E, B, O, U? 
- Also, we have to consider positions: A cannot be at index0 or index2? T cannot be at index4? 

So A must be at position: 1, 3, or 4? 
T must be at position: 0,1,2,3? 

Possible next guess: we can try a word that has A and T? And try to test a position for A? And also try other common letters? 

Also, we haven't tried letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

We want to pick a word that uses A and T? And three new letters? Also, we should place A at one of the possible positions: 1,3,4? Similarly T at any position except 4? And verify it doesn't have any excluded letter? 

But note: we haven't detected any double letters? But it's possible? 

We can try to cover common letters: for example, S, L, I, D, M, etc? 

Candidate words? 

First, with A at a new possible position? Let's try A at index1: for example? Or index3? 

But we don't know? So we might want to test a position? And also test new letters? 

For example: 
- How about ""SALTY""? But S? and L? But we must exclude O? We don't have excluded? But O is excluded? So we cannot use O? ""SALTY"" has O? Wait, no? SALTY: S, A, L, T, Y? 

But check excluded? O is excluded? But ""SALTY"" doesn't have O? So it's okay? 

But wait: we also must not use: C,R,N,E,B,O,U? So ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y -> none are excluded? So it's valid? 

In ""SALTY"":
- A is at index1?
- T is at index3? 

Also, S, L, Y are new letters? 

But positions:
If we pick ""SALTY"":
   Index0: S
   Index1: A? -> now, we know A cannot be at index1? Or we test it: if correct, we get check? If not, then we know A isn't at index1? So we narrow? 

Similarly T: at index3? Which is allowed? 

We also get to test S at index0? L at index2? Y at index4? 

But note: the feedback for T? We have T? Already? So we can see if T is placed correctly at index3? Or elsewhere? 

But wait: we know T is present? But not at index4? Now we are testing T at index3? So we might get information? 

So ""SALTY"" is possible? 

But note: what about the secret word? It might have T at other positions? 

Alternative: perhaps ""PATSY""? But P? And S? But A at index1? T at index2? And S? And Y? 

But no excluded letters? 

""PATSY"": P, A, T, S, Y? 

That also: 
- A at index1? 
- T at index2? 

But we haven't tried index2 for T? It's possible? 

However, note: for A? We haven't tried index1? So both words test A at index1? 

But ""SALTY""? Also tests L? And Y? Which are good? 

But let me see? Another candidate: ""TASTY""? But T repeated? We have two T's? And A at index1? T at index0 and index3? 

But we don't have issue? 

We will consider? 

However, our goal? We don't know if there are repeated letters? 

But we can choose? 

But note: ""SALTY"" and ""PATSY"" are both candidates? 

Also ""DAISY""? But D? A? I? S? Y? But A in ""DAISY"" is at index1? But also excludes? We don't have excluded? 

But wait: ""DAISY""? Actually, D(0), A(1), I(2), S(3), Y(4). 

But we just want to test A at index1? 

But note: we know T must be in the word? And ""DAISY"" does not have T? So we must include T? 

Therefore, we cannot guess ""DAISY""? Because we know the word must contain T? And ""DAISY"" doesn't have T? So that would be invalid? 

Similarly, our guess must include A? We know A is in the word? And must include T? 

So we have to include both? 

Therefore, words without T are invalid? 

So ""SALTY"" has T? Yes. 
""PATSY"" has T? Yes? 

What are other possibilities? 

How about ""MATCH""? But C? Excluded? 

How about ""PASTA""? But E excluded? No? But P, A, S, T, A? Has S and T? But A repeated? Also, O? No? But O is excluded? In PASTA? No? But we don't have O? It has P, A, S, T, A? 

But A at index1 and index4? 

But ""PASTA"": index0:P, index1:A, index2:S, index3:T, index4:A? 

And excluded: we must avoid C,R,N,E,B,O,U? So:
P: ok
A: ok
S: ok
T: ok
A: ok? 

But the excluded list: we have to avoid C,R,N,E,B,O,U? So ""PASTA"" uses P, A, S, T? No excluded letters? 

So ""PASTA"" is acceptable? 

In ""PASTA"": 
- A? At index1 and 4? We test A at index1 and index4? 
- T? At index3? 

But we are testing A and T? Plus S and P? 

But note: if we guess ""PASTA"", and if A is only once in the secret? We might get one minus and one x? So that narrows? 

Similarly, we haven't tested S or P? 

But let's compare ""SALTY"" and ""PASTA"": 

- ""SALTY"": letters used: S, A, L, T, Y? 
- ""PASTA"": letters used: P, A, S, T, A? So testing P and S? And also L? But ""SALTY"" tests Y? 

We haven't tested L? So SALTY tests L? PASTA tests P and S? 

We haven't tested S? 

But note: we also haven't tested P? 

But S is more common? 

However, both are acceptable? 

Let me think: we know A is in one of the positions 1,3,4? 

In ""SALTY"", we test A at position1? Which is one candidate? 
In ""PASTA"", we test A at positions1 and also4? 

But we have two A's? Might be wasteful? 

So? 

Alternatively, what about ""TAILS""? But A at index1? And T at index0? 

""TAILS"": T(0), A(1), I(2), L(3), S(4)? 

But then T? At index0? And S? And I, L? 

But we haven't excluded I,L,S? 

Also, T? We know T is in the word? 

But in ""TAILS"": T at index0? We haven't tested that position? So if T? At index0? 

Also, A at index1? 

So ""TAILS"" tests T at index0? And A at index1? Both? 

Similarly? 

And L at index3? S at index4? 

We also avoid excluded? 

So let me choose between ""SALTY"", ""PATSY"", ""PASTA"", ""TAILS""? 

""PATSY"": P, A, T, S, Y? Also? 

But let me list:

- ""SALTY"": S(0), A(1), L(2), T(3), Y(4) -> tests A at position1? And T at position3? 

- ""PATSY"": P(0), A(1), T(2), S(3), Y(4) -> tests A at position1? T at position2? 

- ""TAILS"": T(0), A(1), I(2), L(3), S(4) -> tests A at position1? T at position0? 

- ""PASTA"": P(0), A(1), S(2), T(3), A(4) -> tests A at positions1 and4? T at position3? 

Now note: in the secret word, T cannot be at index4? But we already tested T at index4? So excluding that position? 

We want to test T at new positions? 

Similarly, A? 

In ""TAILS"": T at index0? We haven't tested T at index0? So we can get whether T is at that position? 

Similarly, in ""PATSY"": T at index2? 

So? 

Also, common letters: S, L, T? 

I'll pick ""TAILS"" for the next guess? Why? 

Because we test T at a new position (index0)? We haven't tested T at index0? Or index1? Or index2? Or index3? Only excluded index4? 

So testing index0 might be useful? 

Similarly, A at index1? 

In ""TAILS""? 

We are offering I and L? Which are vowels? But consonants also? 

It includes five new letters: T, A, I, L, S? But T and A are known? So effectively testing I, L, S? 

So ""TAILS"" 

Therefore? 

Guess: ""tails""? 

But note: T at index0 and A at index1? 

We then expect feedback: either T might be correct? Or A? Or both? 

Also, we might get minuses? 

We can then use that information? 

So decided: ""TAILS"" 

Confirm: ""tails"" is a valid English word? It means the hindmost part of an animal? Or to follow? But in plural? Yes, as a noun? 

Also, in Wordle? It would be accepted? 

So <guess>tails</guess> 

But note: we have to write the guess? 

But let me think? 

Alternatively, ""STAIN""? But N? Excluded? Cannot. 

Therefore, I'll proceed with ""tails"". 

<guess>tails</guess>Based on the feedback:
- **Absent letters (x):** C, R, N, E, B, O, U  
  → Excluded from future guesses.
- **Confirmed present letters:** A and T are in the secret word.  
  - **A:** Not at position 0 (from ""about"") or position 2 (from ""crane"").  
  - **T:** Not at position 4 (from ""about"").
- **Possible positions:**  
  - **A:** Must be at index 1, 3, or 4 (0-based).  
  - **T:** Must be at index 0, 1, 2, or 3 (not 4).

For the next guess, the word must:
1. Include **A** and **T** (since they are confirmed present).
2. Exclude the absent letters (C, R, N, E, B, O, U).
3. Test new high-frequency letters (not yet attempted), such as S, L, I, D, G, H.
4. Ideally, position **A** at an untested position (1, 3, or 4) and **T** at an untested position (0, 1, 2, or 3) to gather more information.

Chosen guess: **""tails""**  
- Composition: T (index 0), A (index 1), I (index 2), L (index 3), S (index 4).  
- Why this word?  
  - Tests **A** at the new position 1 (previously untested positions were 0 and 2).  
  - Tests **T** at the new position 0 (only position 4 has been tested).  
  - Introduces new common letters: I, L, S (all untested and high-frequency).  
  - Avoids excluded letters.  
- Potential outcomes:  
  - If **A** is at position 1, feedback will show ✓.  
  - If **T** is at position 0, feedback will show ✓.  
  - Otherwise, minuses will help narrow positions for A/T while confirming other letters in the word.

This guess efficiently narrows possible positions for A and T while covering new letters.

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.\n Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n Let me think: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, etc.\n\n I recall that ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning the accumulated earnings of a company) and it uses common letters. However, let me check if it\'s valid.\n Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is a very common starting word.\n\n But note: the problem says the word must be a valid 5-letter English word.\n\n Another good one is ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.\n\n However, I think ""SLATE"" is also a top choice. It has S, L, A, T, E.\n\n Since we are at the first guess, any of these would be fine.\n\n Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it covers 5 common letters: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n So, my first guess will be: CRANE.\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":\n C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.\n R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.\n A(-) -> A is in the word but not in the position we guessed (position 3 in ""crane"").\n N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.\n E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.\n\n Therefore, we know:\n - The secret word does not contain C, R, N, E.\n - It does contain the letter A, but not in the third position.\n\n Since the secret word is 5 letters and contains A, but not in position 3 (index 2, if we start counting at 0), then A must be in one of the positions: 0, 1, 3, or 4.\n\n We also know that the letters C, R, N, E are absent. So we avoid these.\n\n For the next guess, we need:\n - A 5-letter word that includes the letter A (in a position other than the third) and excludes C, R, N, E.\n - We want to test other common letters and try to cover additional letters.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that haven\'t been tested yet. Remaining frequent letters: T, O, I, S, L, etc.\n\n We also note that the word must have A in either position 0, 1, 3, or 4.\n\n Possible strategy: choose a word that has A in a different position and uses other common consonants and vowels.\n\n Example possibilities:\n - Place A in position 0: words like ""AUDIO"", ""ABOUT"" but note that we cannot use R (in ""ABOUT"", R is absent? Actually, we don\'t have R because R is excluded). Let\'s check our constraints.\n\n But wait: we have to avoid C, R, N, E. So:\n - ""ABOUT"": contains B, O, U, T. And A at position 0. Also, it doesn\'t contain C, R, N, E? It has A: yes, but we must check the letters: A, B, O, U, T. So R, C, N, E are absent -> acceptable.\n\n - Alternatively, place A at position 1: words like ""SALAD"" but that has repeated A? Also, L is allowed and common. But note: we don\'t have constraints on repeated letters? However, the feedback didn\'t show double A so we don\'t know if the secret has repeated letters. But ""SALAD"" has two A\'s? Actually, ""SALAD"" isn\'t 5 unique letters? Let me think: we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Considering the above, let\'s try to choose a word with:\n   - A in a position that isn\'t 2, and not 2 (which we already know) but also avoid position 3? We don\'t know, so we can put it in any of {0,1,3,4}.\n   - Also include other common vowels and consonants: T, O, I, S, L, etc.\n\n However, note the feedback for A: we got a minus, meaning it\'s in the word but in a different position. So we don\'t know where exactly.\n\n Let me try to consider: the secret word has A, and we don\'t have any other known letters? So let\'s try to cover more ground.\n\n Another candidate: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T. A is at position 2? Wait, position 2 is the third character -> that wouldn\'t work because we know A isn\'t at position 2? Actually, the third position in the word is index 2 (if 0-indexed: positions 0,1,2,3,4). So in ""crane"", A was at index 2. Therefore, we must place A at index 0,1,3, or 4.\n\n In ""PLAIT"", if we break it down:\n   P (0), L (1), A (2) -> index 2 is not allowed? Actually, we cannot put A at index 2 because we know that in the secret word A is not at index 2. Therefore, we must choose a word where A is at a different index.\n\n ""PLAIT"" is invalid for our purpose because it has A at index 2.\n\n Let me think of another word: ""TABLE""? But E is excluded -> we cannot use E.\n\n ""TABBY""? But Y is a possibility. However, we want to avoid excluded letters: E is excluded, so we cannot use E. Also ""TABBY"" has B twice? Also, A is at index 1: that\'s allowed.\n\n But wait, ""TABBY"": T(0), A(1), B(2), B(3), Y(4). We are using A at index 1, which is acceptable. However, we have repeated B? We don\'t know if the secret word has repeated letters. But it\'s okay to guess repeated letters? However, we are limited by the fact that we must avoid C, R, N, E.\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""AVAIL""? But then we have V and two A\'s? And V is less common. Also, we are avoiding R? The word ""AVAIL"" doesn\'t have R, C, N, E? So allowed. But our goal is to cover new letters.\n\n Let me try to find a word that doesn\'t have A at index 2 and uses common letters.\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.\n\n How about ""SALAD""? But that has two A\'s? Still, A at index 1 and 3? Also, it has L and D. But let\'s write: S(0), A(1), L(2), A(3), D(4). So A appears at index 1 (which is allowed) and index 3 (which is also allowed). But we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s? We can use it.\n\n But note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us if a letter appears more than once, unless we get multiple minuses or checks? Actually, the feedback per letter: if we guess two A\'s and there is one A in the secret, we might get one minus and one x? So it\'s okay to try.\n\n However, let\'s choose a more efficient word: a word that uses five new distinct letters including A? But A is required.\n\n We know A must be in the word, so we can choose a word that has A and four letters we haven\'t tried.\n\n Let me think: ""PLANT"" is not good because N is excluded? We cannot use N.\n\n How about ""PLAIT"" but we cannot use A at index 2? So we skip.\n\n Alternative: ""PASTA"" -> P, A, S, T, A -> two A\'s? But A at index 1 and 4? Actually, positions: index0: P, index1: A (allowed), index2: S, index3: T, index4: A (allowed). And no E, R, C, N? Actually, we are excluding C, R, N, E -> so P, A, S, T are okay? The word is valid.\n\n But let me check if ""PASTA"" is a valid English word? Yes.\n\n However, we haven\'t tried S, T, and P? That\'s good.\n\n Alternatively, ""TOAST"" -> but has T and O, but S. However, ""TOAST"" contains T twice? And A at index 2? Wait, index0:T, index1:O, index2:A? We cannot put A at index 2? So invalid.\n\n Instead, what about ""PAINT""? N is excluded? We cannot use N.\n\n Let me think: ""SLATE"" is not possible because E is excluded.\n\n How about ""BASIC""? Well, C is excluded? C is absent -> we cannot use C? But C is excluded? So no.\n\n Another: ""ABOUT"": A at index0? That\'s allowed: A(0), B(1), O(2), U(3), T(4). Letters: A, B, O, U, T. None of C, R, N, E? So it\'s valid.\n\n Also, ""ABOUT"" uses common vowels and consonants? Yes.\n\n Additionally, it uses B, O, U, T? We haven\'t checked these.\n\n Alternatively, ""ADIEU"" is not allowed because E is excluded.\n\n So ""ABOUT"" seems a good candidate.\n\n But note: what about ""AUDIO""? That has A at index0? A(0), U(1), D(2), I(3), O(4). Also, avoids excluded letters? Yes? It has D and I? And we avoid C, R, N, E? So yes.\n\n Let\'s compare:\n\n ""ABOUT"" vs ""AUDIO"": both contain A at index0, but which gives more information?\n\n We know the secret word has A? So in either word, we are testing:\n\n For ""ABOUT"": \n   Position0: A -> if it\'s correct we get check, if wrong we know A is not at 0? And similarly for the other letters.\n\n For ""AUDIO"": also tests U, D, I, O.\n\n But note: vowels are often in words? However, we already know that the secret contains A? Let\'s not forget that.\n\n I think both are acceptable.\n\n Another candidate: ""PATIO""? That has A at index1: P, A, T, I, O? That\'s also good? And it doesn\'t use excluded letters? Yes.\n\n Comparison of letters:\n\n ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T\n ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O\n ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O\n\n Which one? They all test A in a different position? Actually, ""ABOUT"" tests A at position0, ""PATIO"" tests A at position1, and ""AUDIO"" tests A at position0.\n\n Since we have no information about where A is (except that it\'s not at index2), testing A at a different position might be beneficial? We have already tested index2? So let\'s try index0 or index1?\n\n How about testing A in a position we haven\'t tested? Currently we only know about index2? So index0,1,3,4 are untested? We can choose any.\n\n Let me think: if we put A at index0 and it is correct, we get a check. If it is present but wrong position? Then we know it\'s in the word? We already know that? So it won\'t help? Actually, no: if we get a minus for A at index0, we know that A is in the word (we already know) but not at index0? So narrowing down.\n\n Similarly for index1.\n\n But also, we want to test new letters? So let\'s compare the sets:\n\n ""ABOUT"": tests B, O, U, T? All new.\n ""PATIO"": tests P, T, I, O? And A? Also new letters: P, T, I, O? Note that T and O are in ""ABOUT"", but ""ABOUT"" also has B and U? Both are equally good?\n\n However, ""ABOUT"" and ""PATIO"" both test 4 new letters? Actually, no: they share T and O? Actually, ""ABOUT"": letters [A, B, O, U, T] -> new: B, O, U, T. Also A? But we already know A? So effectively 4 new.\n\n Similarly, ""PATIO"": letters [P, A, T, I, O] -> new: P, T, I, O? We haven\'t tested T? Actually, we haven\'t tested T? Yes? So both are 4 new.\n\n But note: we are testing A again? Yes? Because we need to check its position? And we are forced to include A.\n\n Let me check ""AUDIO"": [A, U, D, I, O] -> new: U, D, I, O? Also 4 new.\n\n Which vowel combinations? Both are fine? What about consonants? \n\n Let\'s think about frequency: in English, T is very common? So testing T might be good. Also, O is common.\n\n Actually, among the new letters: B, O, U, T, P, I, D? \n\n We don\'t have much preference? But note: we have a constraint on A: it must be in one of the positions: 0,1,3,4? In ""ABOUT"", we test A at position0? If we get a minus, we know A is not at 0? Similarly for the letters in the other positions.\n\n So I think any of these words is acceptable.\n\n Let me go with ""ABOUT""? It tests A at position0? We haven\'t tried position0? So that could be beneficial? If we get a minus for A at position0, we rule it out? Then A must be in 1,3, or 4? \n\n Alternatively, ""PATIO"" tests A at position1? \n\n But note: in the secret word, A might be at position0? Then why not test position0? \n\n So that makes sense? \n\n Therefore, I\'ll choose ""ABOUT""? \n\n Remember: we have to avoid excluded letters: ""ABOUT"" only uses A,B,O,U,T? And none of the excluded C,R,N,E? So good.\n\n Let me confirm: \n   A at index0: if correct? Will be marked check? If secret has A at a different position? Then marked minus? \n   Similarly, other letters.\n\n So I will go with ""ABOUT"".\n\n Alternatively, let me see if there is a word that doesn\'t have A at index0 or index2? Maybe test a position we haven\'t tested? We have tested index2? So ideally, we test index0,1,3,4? \n\n How about testing A at index1? ""PATIO"" does that? So that\'s also good? Actually, both positions (0 and 1) are equally unknown.\n\n However, I recall that A is more common in the second position? For example, in 5-letter words? But no? Actually, no such bias? \n\n So I\'ll pick ""ABOUT"" arbitrarily.\n\n But wait: what about the word ""SALAD""? It would test A at index1 and index3? But we are not forced to test multiple positions? Actually, that might be inefficient because we are using an extra A? And we only have 6 guesses? So probably better to test one A and many other letters.\n\n Therefore, I\'ll go with ""ABOUT"".\n\n Guess: ""ABOUT""\n\n<guess>about</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": \n- C, R, N, E are confirmed **absent** (x).\n- A is present but not in position 2 (index 3 of the word, since indexing starts at 0). \n  \nFor the next guess, I need a word:\n1. Includes A (in position 0, 1, 3, or 4).\n2. Excludes C, R, N, E.\n3. Uses new common letters (e.g., T, O, U, B, P, I) to maximize information gain.\n\nChoosing **""about""**:\n- Tests A at position 0 (new position).\n- Introduces B, O, U, T (common letters not yet tested).\n- Valid 5-letter word avoiding excluded letters.\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down the position of A and checks new high-frequency letters.\n\n<guess>about</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two sets of feedback:\n\n1.

T cannot be at index4? \n\nSo A must be at position: 1, 3, or 4? \nT must be at position: 0,1,2,3? \n\nPossible next guess: we can try a word that has A and T? And try to test a position for A? And also try other common letters? \n\nAlso, we haven\'t tried letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z? \n\nWe want to pick a word that uses A and T? And three new letters? Also, we should place A at one of the possible positions: 1,3,4? Similarly T at any position except 4? And verify it doesn\'t have any excluded letter? \n\nBut note: we haven\'t detected any double letters? But it\'s possible? \n\nWe can try to cover common letters: for example, S, L, I, D, M, etc? \n\nCandidate words? \n\nFirst, with A at a new possible position? Let\'s try A at index1: for example? Or index3? \n\nBut we don\'t know? So we might want to test a position? And also test new letters? \n\nFor example: \n- How about ""SALTY""? But S? and L? But we must exclude O? We don\'t have excluded? But O is excluded? So we cannot use O? ""SALTY"" has O? Wait, no? SALTY: S, A, L, T, Y? \n\nBut check excluded? O is excluded? But ""SALTY"" doesn\'t have O? So it\'s okay? \n\nBut wait: we also must not use: C,R,N,E,B,O,U? So ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y -> none are excluded? So it\'s valid? \n\nIn ""SALTY"":\n- A is at index1?\n- T is at index3? \n\nAlso, S, L, Y are new letters? \n\nBut positions:\nIf we pick ""SALTY"":\n   Index0: S\n   Index1: A? -> now, we know A cannot be at index1? Or we test it: if correct, we get check? If not, then we know A isn\'t at index1? So we narrow? \n\nSimilarly T: at index3? Which is allowed? \n\nWe also get to test S at index0? L at index2? Y at index4? \n\nBut note: the feedback for T? We have T? Already? So we can see if T is placed correctly at index3? Or elsewhere? \n\nBut wait: we know T is present? But not at index4? Now we are testing T at index3? So we might get information? \n\nSo ""SALTY"" is possible? \n\nBut note: what about the secret word? It might have T at other positions? \n\nAlternative: perhaps ""PATSY""? But P? And S? But A at index1? T at index2? And S? And Y? \n\nBut no excluded letters? \n\n""PATSY"": P, A, T, S, Y? \n\nThat also: \n- A at index1? \n- T at index2? \n\nBut we haven\'t tried index2 for T? It\'s possible? \n\nHowever, note: for A? We haven\'t tried index1? So both words test A at index1? \n\nBut ""SALTY""? Also tests L? And Y? Which are good? \n\nBut let me see? Another candidate: ""TASTY""? But T repeated? We have two T\'s? And A at index1? T at index0 and index3? \n\nBut we don\'t have issue? \n\nWe will consider? \n\nHowever, our goal? We don\'t know if there are repeated letters? \n\nBut we can choose? \n\nBut note: ""SALTY"" and ""PATSY"" are both candidates? \n\nAlso ""DAISY""? But D? A? I? S? Y? But A in ""DAISY"" is at index1? But also excludes? We don\'t have excluded? \n\nBut wait: ""DAISY""? Actually, D(0), A(1), I(2), S(3), Y(4). \n\nBut we just want to test A at index1? \n\nBut note: we know T must be in the word? And ""DAISY"" does not have T? So we must include T? \n\nTherefore, we cannot guess ""DAISY""? Because we know the word must contain T? And ""DAISY"" doesn\'t have T? So that would be invalid? \n\nSimilarly, our guess must include A? We know A is in the word? And must include T? \n\nSo we have to include both? \n\nTherefore, words without T are invalid? \n\nSo ""SALTY"" has T? Yes. \n""PATSY"" has T? Yes? \n\nWhat are other possibilities? \n\nHow about ""MATCH""? But C? Excluded? \n\nHow about ""PASTA""? But E excluded? No? But P, A, S, T, A? Has S and T? But A repeated? Also, O? No? But O is excluded? In PASTA? No? But we don\'t have O? It has P, A, S, T, A? \n\nBut A at index1 and index4? \n\nBut ""PASTA"": index0:P, index1:A, index2:S, index3:T, index4:A? \n\nAnd excluded: we must avoid C,R,N,E,B,O,U? So:\nP: ok\nA: ok\nS: ok\nT: ok\nA: ok? \n\nBut the excluded list: we have to avoid C,R,N,E,B,O,U? So ""PASTA"" uses P, A, S, T? No excluded letters? \n\nSo ""PASTA"" is acceptable? \n\nIn ""PASTA"": \n- A? At index1 and 4? We test A at index1 and index4? \n- T? At index3? \n\nBut we are testing A and T? Plus S and P? \n\nBut note: if we guess ""PASTA"", and if A is only once in the secret? We might get one minus and one x? So that narrows? \n\nSimilarly, we haven\'t tested S or P? \n\nBut let\'s compare ""SALTY"" and ""PASTA"": \n\n- ""SALTY"": letters used: S, A, L, T, Y? \n- ""PASTA"": letters used: P, A, S, T, A? So testing P and S? And also L? But ""SALTY"" tests Y? \n\nWe haven\'t tested L? So SALTY tests L? PASTA tests P and S? \n\nWe haven\'t tested S? \n\nBut note: we also haven\'t tested P? \n\nBut S is more common? \n\nHowever, both are acceptable? \n\nLet me think: we know A is in one of the positions 1,3,4? \n\nIn ""SALTY"", we test A at position1? Which is one candidate? \nIn ""PASTA"", we test A at positions1 and also4? \n\nBut we have two A\'s? Might be wasteful? \n\nSo? \n\nAlternatively, what about ""TAILS""? But A at index1? And T at index0? \n\n""TAILS"": T(0), A(1), I(2), L(3), S(4)? \n\nBut then T? At index0? And S? And I, L? \n\nBut we haven\'t excluded I,L,S? \n\nAlso, T? We know T is in the word? \n\nBut in ""TAILS"": T at index0? We haven\'t tested that position? So if T? At index0? \n\nAlso, A at index1? \n\nSo ""TAILS"" tests T at index0? And A at index1? Both? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nAnd L at index3? S at index4? \n\nWe also avoid excluded? \n\nSo let me choose between ""SALTY"", ""PATSY"", ""PASTA"", ""TAILS""? \n\n""PATSY"": P, A, T, S, Y? Also? \n\nBut let me list:\n\n- ""SALTY"": S(0), A(1), L(2), T(3), Y(4) -> tests A at position1? And T at position3? \n\n- ""PATSY"": P(0), A(1), T(2), S(3), Y(4) -> tests A at position1? T at position2? \n\n- ""TAILS"": T(0), A(1), I(2), L(3), S(4) -> tests A at position1? T at position0? \n\n- ""PASTA"": P(0), A(1), S(2), T(3), A(4) -> tests A at positions1 and4? T at position3? \n\nNow note: in the secret word, T cannot be at index4? But we already tested T at index4? So excluding that position? \n\nWe want to test T at new positions? \n\nSimilarly, A? \n\nIn ""TAILS"": T at index0? We haven\'t tested T at index0? So we can get whether T is at that position? \n\nSimilarly, in ""PATSY"": T at index2? \n\nSo? \n\nAlso, common letters: S, L, T? \n\nI\'ll pick ""TAILS"" for the next guess? Why? \n\nBecause we test T at a new position (index0)? We haven\'t tested T at index0? Or index1? Or index2? Or index3? Only excluded index4? \n\nSo testing index0 might be useful? \n\nSimilarly, A at index1? \n\nIn ""TAILS""? \n\nWe are offering I and L? Which are vowels? But consonants also? \n\nIt includes five new letters: T, A, I, L, S? But T and A are known? So effectively testing I, L, S? \n\nSo ""TAILS"" \n\nTherefore? \n\nGuess: ""tails""? \n\nBut note: T at index0 and A at index1? \n\nWe then expect feedback: either T might be correct? Or A? Or both? \n\nAlso, we might get minuses? \n\nWe can then use that information? \n\nSo decided: ""TAILS"" \n\nConfirm: ""tails"" is a valid English word? It means the hindmost part of an animal? Or to follow? But in plural? Yes, as a noun? \n\nAlso, in Wordle? It would be accepted? \n\nSo <guess>tails</guess> \n\nBut note: we have to write the guess? \n\nBut let me think? \n\nAlternatively, ""STAIN""? But N? Excluded? Cannot. \n\nTherefore, I\'ll proceed with ""tails"". \n\n<guess>tails</guess>Based on the feedback:\n- **Absent letters (x):** C, R, N, E, B, O, U  \n  → Excluded from future guesses.\n- **Confirmed present letters:** A and T are in the secret word.  \n  - **A:** Not at position 0 (from ""about"") or position 2 (from ""crane"").  \n  - **T:** Not at position 4 (from ""about"").\n- **Possible positions:**  \n  - **A:** Must be at index 1, 3, or 4 (0-based).  \n  - **T:** Must be at index 0, 1, 2, or 3 (not 4).\n\nFor the next guess, the word must:\n1. Include **A** and **T** (since they are confirmed present).\n2. Exclude the absent letters (C, R, N, E, B, O, U).\n3. Test new high-frequency letters (not yet attempted), such as S, L, I, D, G, H.\n4. Ideally, position **A** at an untested position (1, 3, or 4) and **T** at an untested position (0, 1, 2, or 3) to gather more information.\n\nChosen guess: **""tails""**  \n- Composition: T (index 0), A (index 1), I (index 2), L (index 3), S (index 4).  \n- Why this word?  \n  - Tests **A** at the new position 1 (previously untested positions were 0 and 2).  \n  - Tests **T** at the new position 0 (only position 4 has been tested).  \n  - Introduces new common letters: I, L, S (all untested and high-frequency).  \n  - Avoids excluded letters.  \n- Potential outcomes:  \n  - If **A** is at position 1, feedback will show ✓.  \n  - If **T** is at position 0, feedback will show ✓.  \n  - Otherwise, minuses will help narrow positions for A/T while confirming other letters in the word.\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows possible positions for A and T while covering new letters.\n\n<guess>tails</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(-)\nGuess 3: tails -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(✓) I(x) L(x) S(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Interpretation:
- C, R, N, E are absent (not in the word).
- A is present but not in position 2 (index 2).

Guess 2: about -> Feedback: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(-)
Interpretation:
- A is present but not in position 0 (since ""about"" has A at index 0).
- B, O, U are absent.
- T is present but not in position 4 (since ""about"" has T at index 4).

Guess 3: tails -> Feedback: T(-) A(✓) I(x) L(x) S(-)
Interpretation:
- T is present but not in position 0 (since ""tails"" has T at index 0).
- A is correct and in the correct position (index 1), because we got a check at A in ""tails"" (position 1).
- I and L are absent.
- S is present but not in position 4 (since ""tails"" has S at index 4).

Now, let's summarize what we know:

1. Correctly placed letters:
   - A is at position 1 (index 1, second letter).

2. Present letters (in the word, but not necessarily in the correct position):
   - T: present, but not at index 0 (from ""tails"") and not at index 4 (from ""about""). Also, from ""tails"", T is not at index 0, and we know it must be in the word somewhere else.
   - S: present, but not at index 4 (from ""tails"").

3. Absent letters:
   From Guess 1: C, R, N, E
   From Guess 2: B, O, U
   From Guess 3: I, L
   So absent: B, C, E, I, L, N, O, R, U.

   Therefore, the remaining possible letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. Structure of the word:
   We know the second letter is A: _ A _ _ _

   The word must contain at least T and S (besides A), but note that T and S are confirmed to be present. Also, there could be other letters.

5. Positions for T and S:
   - T cannot be at index 0 or 4. Possible positions: index 1? But index 1 is occupied by A? So T cannot be at index 1 either? Because A is there? Therefore, T must be at index 2 or 3? 
   - Similarly, S cannot be at index 4? But it can be at index 0, 2, or 3? However, index 1 is occupied, so S cannot be there either? So S at 0,2,3.

But note: we don't know if T or S can be at the same position? We have 5 distinct positions? And each position must be filled.

So the word structure:

Positions: 0, 1=A, 2, 3, 4.

T must be at index 2 or 3? (not 0,1,4)

S must be at index 0,2,3? (not 4, and since index1 is taken, only 0,2,3 available? But T is also to be placed? So possible overlap? Or not? But T and S are distinct? So they can't occupy the same slot? However, we don't know if there are other letters? 

Actually, we have:

The word has A at index 1? And contains T and S? But we don't know the other two letters? Because the word is 5 letters? So we need to find a word that has form: 

- Position1: A
- Contains T and S? And two other letters from the remaining alphabet? And excludes the absent letters.

We also note: T must be in the word? And we haven't placed T? Similarly for S? 

So possible patterns? 

Pattern: 
Index0: ? (could be S or another letter)
Index1: A (fixed)
Index2: ? (could be T, or S, or another letter? but T can be here? or S? etc.)
Index3: ? 
Index4: ? (not S? but S is present? So index4 cannot be S? but index4 could be T? However, we know T is not at index4? So index4 is neither T nor S? So either the letter at index4 is not T and not S? But we have two more letters to find? 

Actually, let's list:

We know:

- The word must have: A (at pos1), T (somewhere? but not pos0,4? and not pos1? so pos2 or 3), and S? (somewhere? not pos4? and not pos1? so pos0,2,3).

But note: we don't know if T and S are the only other letters? There are two more? 

So word: ? A ? ? ? 

We have:

- T must be in pos2 or pos3?
- S must be in pos0, or pos2, or pos3?

But pos2 and pos3 can only hold one letter each? So if both T and S are to be placed? And if we put T at pos2? Then S can be at pos0 or pos3? Similarly, if T at pos3? S at pos0 or pos2? 

But also? The remaining position? We have position4? Which must be a letter that is not T? And not S? And must be one of the remaining letters? 

Therefore, possible arrangements:

Case 1: T at pos2? Then S at pos0 or pos3? 

But we also have pos4? 

Case 2: T at pos3? Then S at pos0 or pos2? 

Plus? Whatever? We have the other positions? 

But we need to guess a word that uses A at position1? And places T and S? And the other two letters? Which we haven't guessed? 

What about the feedback? 

We also note: S was present in ""tails"" and T was present? And we tested? 

Now? We need to choose a new word? 

First: we know the word must have A at position1? And T and S? Plus two more letters? 

The two more letters must be from: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

We can choose? 

But note: we also want to test possible positions for T and S? 

We already know T cannot be at pos0 and pos4? So only pos2 or 3? Similarly S? Cannot be at pos4? So pos0,2,3? 

We also haven't placed S or T? 

So? Guess: Try a word that has T? Maybe at pos2? Or pos3? And S? 

We also want to test other common letters? 

But we are constrained? 

For example: let's try to set T at pos2? Then? 

Pattern: T at pos2: ? A T ? ? 

But we must have S? And one more? 

And pattern: S must be at pos0 or pos3 or pos4? But S cannot be at pos4? Because? From tails? Feedback: S(-) and we guessed at pos4? So S not at 4? So S must be at pos0 or pos3? 

But we also have T at pos2? So:

If T at pos2? Then:
- S at pos0? Then pattern: S A T ? ? 
- or S at pos3? Then pattern: ? A T S ?

But what about the last two positions? 

We don't know? 

Similarly? If T at pos3? Then T at pos3? And S at pos0 or pos2? 

But we must fill position4? 

So? 

Possible guesses? 

We can try both? 

Note: we have excluded some letters? But we haven't tried: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

But common letters? We want to choose common words? 

How about ""SATYR""? But R? Absent? So cannot? 

How about ""SATIN""? But N? Absent? 

How about ""SATAY""? But A repeated? And Y? But let's see? 

But S? We can try a word starting with S? 

Pattern: S A _ _ _

And T? We can place at 2? Or 3? 

But we have T? So? 

And we need two more letters? 

How about ""SATED""? But E? Absent? 

How about ""SATYR""? But R? Absent? 

So? 

How about without S? But S must be present? So we have to include? 

Therefore? 

Perhaps ""SAVAS""? But V? And repeated A? But let's? 

But we need T? Where is T? 

We must include T? 

So? 

Therefore? 

We need a word having A at pos1? And containing T and S? 

And not having absent letters? 

Let's list? Words: 

Pattern: S A T ? ? : but then T? We can? 

But does T have to be there? 

Let's see? 

For example: ""SATES""? But E? And S repeated? E? Absent? 

In ""SATES"": S, A, T, E, S? E is absent? 

Not allowed? 

""SATYR"": S, A, T, Y, R? R? Absent? 

""SATIN"": S, A, T, I, N? N absent? And I absent? 

So no? 

Pattern: ? A S ? ?

We could place T? 

For example? 

If S is at pos2? Then word: _ A S _ _

Pattern? 

And T? Must be at pos3? Because we cannot put T at pos0? Because? We know T is present? And available positions left: pos0,3,4? But we can put T at pos3? Because we don't know? 

And S at pos2? 

So pattern: _ A S T ? 

Then? We have to find a letter for pos0? And pos4? And exclude absent letters? 

So word: X A S T Y? 

Where X and Y are from the remaining alphabet? 

What words? Like ""HASTY""? But H? And Y? 

Also? Check absent? 

""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> no excluded letters? 

Similarly? Other words: ""MASTY""? Probably not a word? 

""PASTY""? But P? That's a word? Meaning of or like paste? 

But ""PASTY"" is accepted? 

But we can also have? 

Wait? What about ""PASTE""? But E? Absent? 

Therefore? 

""HASTY"" or ""PASTY""? 

But we also have option: S at pos0? 

Then word: S A ? ? ? 

With T? At pos2 or 3? 

So? 

Pattern: S A T ? ? -> words? 

""SATAY""? Is it a word? Satay? It's a dish? Often spelled S-A-T-A-Y? 

But we have constraints: pos0=S, pos1=A, pos2=T, pos3=A? But A repeated? And Y? 

But also? We have T? 

But ""SATAY"": S,A,T,A,Y? 

Check absent? We avoid B,C,E,I,L,N,O,R,U? So S,A,T,Y are okay? 

Also? Position4: must be Y? 

Is ""SATAY"" a valid English word? Yes? 

But let's compare: 

Option 1: ""HASTY"": pattern: H A S T Y? 
But we have S at pos2? 

And T at pos3? 

We tested S? We guessed S? But we don't know? 

Similarly? 

Option 2: ""SATAY"": pattern: S A T A Y? 

But also? 

Option 3: ""PASTY"": pattern: P A S T Y? 

Here? S at pos2? T at pos3? 

And P? 

These are possible? 

But we also have the constraint? In ""HASTY""? 

We need to choose one? 

We know? From ""tails""? We got S(-)? So S is present? But we don't know where? Similarly T? 

But we want to test? For example? 

In ""HASTY"", we can test:

If S is at index2? Then we might get a minus? Or even a check? 

Similarly? 

But let me think: we haven't tested H? So if we guess ""HASTY"", we are testing H? Which is unknown? 

Similarly? 

Alternatively? We know the secret? 

But we must include T? 

Also? We can also consider? 

But note: we have only 6 guesses? And we are on the third guess? So we have three more? 

So? We can guess? 

But we have A placed? 

We can also consider: the position of T or S? 

In the previous guess? We tested T at pos0? And we got a minus? So T not at 0? Now? We want to test? 

For example? Test T at pos2? 

So a guess that has T at pos2? 

Similarly? 

So? Pattern: ? A T ? ?

But we must have S? 

So? 

For example? 

We could try ""PAYTS""? But not a word? 

""MATHS""? But M? A? But A at pos1? T at pos2? H? M? 

""MATHS"": M, A, T, H, S? 

Pattern: M A T H S? 

But T at pos2? 

Also? 

We need to avoid absent? Maths? M, A, T, H, S? All allowed? 

So? 

""MATHS"" is a word? 

Similarly? 

But in this? We test T? At pos2? And S? At pos4? But we have feedback: S? Cannot be at pos4? Because from tails? S was tested at pos4? And got minus? So S not at pos4? 

Therefore? ""MATHS"" has S at pos4? Which is forbidden? Because S cannot be at pos4? 

Therefore? We cannot use words with S at pos4? 

Similarly? 

Therefore? For the pattern: _ A T _ _ 

We need S? So S must be at pos3? Or pos0? 

But if? 

For pattern? 

Case? 

Pattern with T at pos2: 

Then S? At pos0: S A T ? ? -> like ""SATYR""? But R? Absent? 

Or S at pos3: which requires _ A T S ? 

So words? Any? 

For example: ""MATSY""? Not common? 

""HATSY""? Not a word? 

""PATSY"": P, A, T, S, Y? But we got? 

Wait? ""PATSY"" was considered? 

But ""PATSY"": P A T S Y? 

Pattern: P A T S Y? 

Now? T at pos2? And S at pos3? 

Both tested? 

Also? P? And Y? 

And avoid absent? Yes? 

Also? Is ""PATSY"" a valid word? Yes? Meaning a person who is easily taken advantage of? Or a scapegoat? 

So good? 

Similarly? 

But note: we get to test? 

Also? We haven't tested P or Y? 

So? 

Another? 

Similarly? Pattern with T at pos3: then word? _ A _ T _ 

And S? Must be at pos0 or pos2? 

If S at pos0: S A ? T ? 

Words: ""SAYTS""? Not word? 

""SAFTY""? Not common? 

""SAVOT""? No? 

Not many? 

If S at pos2: _ A S T _ 

Then words: ""HASTY"", ""NASTY"" but N absent? ""MASTY"" not word? ""PASTY"", ""TASTY""? 

""TASTY"": T? But cannot T at pos0? Because T cannot be at pos0? 

But let's check ""TASTY"": T(0), A(1), S(2), T(3), Y(4)? 

T at pos0? But we know T cannot be at pos0? Because in ""tails"" we guessed T at pos0? And got minus? So T not at pos0? So we cannot use ""TASTY""? 

Similarly? ""PASTY"": P A S T Y? 

Pattern: P(0), A(1), S(2), T(3), Y(4)? 

No T at pos0? 

So ""PASTY""? 

Yes? 

We can also use ""HASTY""? 

But ""HASTY"" and ""PASTY""? Both are words? 

Which? 

But note: we have already:

Pattern: with T at pos3: and S at pos2? 

Word: ... A S T ... 

So? 

Or T at pos2? And S at pos3? Word: ... A T S ... 

Both patterns are covered by:

- T at pos2, S at pos3: pattern _ A T S ? 
- T at pos3, S at pos2: pattern _ A S T ? 

In both cases? The fourth position? Must be filled? 

We have words? 

For _ A T S ? : ""PATSY"" 

For _ A S T ? : ""PASTY"", ""HASTY""? 

Now? 

We need to choose? 

We also note: we have not tested H and Y? But P? etc? 

So? 

But let's see? 

We can guess ""PASTY""? But? 

We have feedback? 

But to decide? 

Since we are not sure? But we have three possibilities? 

We can choose a word that covers one? 

But note? We are on guess 4? 

So? 

Let's pick ""PATSY""? 

Pattern: P A T S Y? 

We test:

T at pos2? 

S at pos3? 

P and Y? 

Then? Feedback? 

If we get: 

- If T at pos2? We might get check? 
- S at pos3? Check? 

Or minuses? 

But we know A at pos1? 

So? 

Therefore? We'll guess ""patsy""?

But let's see the word? 

<guess>patsy</guess> 

We'll see?
</think>
Based on the feedback from all guesses:

- **Fixed Position:** A is confirmed at position 1 (index 1).
- **Present Letters:** A, T, and S are in the word, but:
  - T is NOT at positions 0 or 4 (from ""about"" and ""tails"").
  - S is NOT at position 4 (from ""tails"").
- **Absent Letters:** B, C, E, I, L, N, O, R, U (from all feedback, plus R, N, E, C, B, O, U, I, L).
- **Possible Positions for T and S:**  
  - T must be at index 2 or 3 (since positions 0, 1, and 4 are invalid/disqualified).  
  - S must be at index 0, 2, or 3 (since position 4 is invalid, and position 1 is occupied by A).
- **Word Structure:** `_ A _ _ _` with T and S required, plus two new letters from unused alphabet: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Given the constraints, **""patsy""** is chosen for Guess 4 because:
- **Tests Key Positions:**  
  - T at position 2 (to check if T is correctly placed here).  
  - S at position 3 (to check placement for S).  
- **Uses New Letters:** Introduces P and Y (untested letters).
- **Fits Constraints:**  
  - Includes A at position 1, T, and S.  
  - Excludes all absent letters.  
  - Valid English word (meaning ""a scapegoat"").

**Expected Insight:**  
- If T is at position 2, it will show as ✓.  
- If S is at position 3, it will show as ✓.  
- Minuses for T or S would confirm their positions are elsewhere, narrowing possibilities significantly.

<guess>patsy</guess>",patsy,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Interpretation:
- C, R, N, E are absent (not in the word).
- A is present but not in position 2 (index 2).

Guess 2: about -> Feedback: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(-)
Interpretation:
- A is present but not in position 0 (since ""about"" has A at index 0).
- B, O, U are absent.
- T is present but not in position 4 (since ""about"" has T at index 4).

Guess 3: tails -> Feedback: T(-) A(✓) I(x) L(x) S(-)
Interpretation:
- T is present but not in position 0 (since ""tails"" has T at index 0).
- A is correct and in the correct position (index 1), because we got a check at A in ""tails"" (position 1).
- I and L are absent.
- S is present but not in position 4 (since ""tails"" has S at index 4).

Now, let's summarize what we know:

1. Correctly placed letters:
   - A is at position 1 (index 1, second letter).

2. Present letters (in the word, but not necessarily in the correct position):
   - T: present, but not at index 0 (from ""tails"") and not at index 4 (from ""about""). Also, from ""tails"", T is not at index 0, and we know it must be in the word somewhere else.
   - S: present, but not at index 4 (from ""tails"").

3. Absent letters:
   From Guess 1: C, R, N, E
   From Guess 2: B, O, U
   From Guess 3: I, L
   So absent: B, C, E, I, L, N, O, R, U.

   Therefore, the remaining possible letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. Structure of the word:
   We know the second letter is A: _ A _ _ _

   The word must contain at least T and S (besides A), but note that T and S are confirmed to be present. Also, there could be other letters.

5. Positions for T and S:
   - T cannot be at index 0 or 4. Possible positions: index 1? But index 1 is occupied by A? So T cannot be at index 1 either? Because A is there? Therefore, T must be at index 2 or 3? 
   - Similarly, S cannot be at index 4? But it can be at index 0, 2, or 3? However, index 1 is occupied, so S cannot be there either? So S at 0,2,3.

But note: we don't know if T or S can be at the same position? We have 5 distinct positions? And each position must be filled.

So the word structure:

Positions: 0, 1=A, 2, 3, 4.

T must be at index 2 or 3? (not 0,1,4)

S must be at index 0,2,3? (not 4, and since index1 is taken, only 0,2,3 available? But T is also to be placed? So possible overlap? Or not? But T and S are distinct? So they can't occupy the same slot? However, we don't know if there are other letters? 

Actually, we have:

The word has A at index 1? And contains T and S? But we don't know the other two letters? Because the word is 5 letters? So we need to find a word that has form: 

- Position1: A
- Contains T and S? And two other letters from the remaining alphabet? And excludes the absent letters.

We also note: T must be in the word? And we haven't placed T? Similarly for S? 

So possible patterns? 

Pattern: 
Index0: ? (could be S or another letter)
Index1: A (fixed)
Index2: ? (could be T, or S, or another letter? but T can be here? or S? etc.)
Index3: ? 
Index4: ? (not S? but S is present? So index4 cannot be S? but index4 could be T? However, we know T is not at index4? So index4 is neither T nor S? So either the letter at index4 is not T and not S? But we have two more letters to find? 

Actually, let's list:

We know:

- The word must have: A (at pos1), T (somewhere? but not pos0,4? and not pos1? so pos2 or 3), and S? (somewhere? not pos4? and not pos1? so pos0,2,3).

But note: we don't know if T and S are the only other letters? There are two more? 

So word: ? A ? ? ? 

We have:

- T must be in pos2 or pos3?
- S must be in pos0, or pos2, or pos3?

But pos2 and pos3 can only hold one letter each? So if both T and S are to be placed? And if we put T at pos2? Then S can be at pos0 or pos3? Similarly, if T at pos3? S at pos0 or pos2? 

But also? The remaining position? We have position4? Which must be a letter that is not T? And not S? And must be one of the remaining letters? 

Therefore, possible arrangements:

Case 1: T at pos2? Then S at pos0 or pos3? 

But we also have pos4? 

Case 2: T at pos3? Then S at pos0 or pos2? 

Plus? Whatever? We have the other positions? 

But we need to guess a word that uses A at position1? And places T and S? And the other two letters? Which we haven't guessed? 

What about the feedback? 

We also note: S was present in ""tails"" and T was present? And we tested? 

Now? We need to choose a new word? 

First: we know the word must have A at position1? And T and S? Plus two more letters? 

The two more letters must be from: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

We can choose? 

But note: we also want to test possible positions for T and S? 

We already know T cannot be at pos0 and pos4? So only pos2 or 3? Similarly S? Cannot be at pos4? So pos0,2,3? 

We also haven't placed S or T? 

So? Guess: Try a word that has T? Maybe at pos2? Or pos3? And S? 

We also want to test other common letters? 

But we are constrained? 

For example: let's try to set T at pos2? Then? 

Pattern: T at pos2: ? A T ? ? 

But we must have S? And one more? 

And pattern: S must be at pos0 or pos3 or pos4? But S cannot be at pos4? Because? From tails? Feedback: S(-) and we guessed at pos4? So S not at 4? So S must be at pos0 or pos3? 

But we also have T at pos2? So:

If T at pos2? Then:
- S at pos0? Then pattern: S A T ? ? 
- or S at pos3? Then pattern: ? A T S ?

But what about the last two positions? 

We don't know? 

Similarly? If T at pos3? Then T at pos3? And S at pos0 or pos2? 

But we must fill position4? 

So? 

Possible guesses? 

We can try both? 

Note: we have excluded some letters? But we haven't tried: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

But common letters? We want to choose common words? 

How about ""SATYR""? But R? Absent? So cannot? 

How about ""SATIN""? But N? Absent? 

How about ""SATAY""? But A repeated? And Y? But let's see? 

But S? We can try a word starting with S? 

Pattern: S A _ _ _

And T? We can place at 2? Or 3? 

But we have T? So? 

And we need two more letters? 

How about ""SATED""? But E? Absent? 

How about ""SATYR""? But R? Absent? 

So? 

How about without S? But S must be present? So we have to include? 

Therefore? 

Perhaps ""SAVAS""? But V? And repeated A? But let's? 

But we need T? Where is T? 

We must include T? 

So? 

Therefore? 

We need a word having A at pos1? And containing T and S? 

And not having absent letters? 

Let's list? Words: 

Pattern: S A T ? ? : but then T? We can? 

But does T have to be there? 

Let's see? 

For example: ""SATES""? But E? And S repeated? E? Absent? 

In ""SATES"": S, A, T, E, S? E is absent? 

Not allowed? 

""SATYR"": S, A, T, Y, R? R? Absent? 

""SATIN"": S, A, T, I, N? N absent? And I absent? 

So no? 

Pattern: ? A S ? ?

We could place T? 

For example? 

If S is at pos2? Then word: _ A S _ _

Pattern? 

And T? Must be at pos3? Because we cannot put T at pos0? Because? We know T is present? And available positions left: pos0,3,4? But we can put T at pos3? Because we don't know? 

And S at pos2? 

So pattern: _ A S T ? 

Then? We have to find a letter for pos0? And pos4? And exclude absent letters? 

So word: X A S T Y? 

Where X and Y are from the remaining alphabet? 

What words? Like ""HASTY""? But H? And Y? 

Also? Check absent? 

""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> no excluded letters? 

Similarly? Other words: ""MASTY""? Probably not a word? 

""PASTY""? But P? That's a word? Meaning of or like paste? 

But ""PASTY"" is accepted? 

But we can also have? 

Wait? What about ""PASTE""? But E? Absent? 

Therefore? 

""HASTY"" or ""PASTY""? 

But we also have option: S at pos0? 

Then word: S A ? ? ? 

With T? At pos2 or 3? 

So? 

Pattern: S A T ? ? -> words? 

""SATAY""? Is it a word? Satay? It's a dish? Often spelled S-A-T-A-Y? 

But we have constraints: pos0=S, pos1=A, pos2=T, pos3=A? But A repeated? And Y? 

But also? We have T? 

But ""SATAY"": S,A,T,A,Y? 

Check absent? We avoid B,C,E,I,L,N,O,R,U? So S,A,T,Y are okay? 

Also? Position4: must be Y? 

Is ""SATAY"" a valid English word? Yes? 

But let's compare: 

Option 1: ""HASTY"": pattern: H A S T Y? 
But we have S at pos2? 

And T at pos3? 

We tested S? We guessed S? But we don't know? 

Similarly? 

Option 2: ""SATAY"": pattern: S A T A Y? 

But also? 

Option 3: ""PASTY"": pattern: P A S T Y? 

Here? S at pos2? T at pos3? 

And P? 

These are possible? 

But we also have the constraint? In ""HASTY""? 

We need to choose one? 

We know? From ""tails""? We got S(-)? So S is present? But we don't know where? Similarly T? 

But we want to test? For example? 

In ""HASTY"", we can test:

If S is at index2? Then we might get a minus? Or even a check? 

Similarly? 

But let me think: we haven't tested H? So if we guess ""HASTY"", we are testing H? Which is unknown? 

Similarly? 

Alternatively? We know the secret? 

But we must include T? 

Also? We can also consider? 

But note: we have only 6 guesses? And we are on the third guess? So we have three more? 

So? We can guess? 

But we have A placed? 

We can also consider: the position of T or S? 

In the previous guess? We tested T at pos0? And we got a minus? So T not at 0? Now? We want to test? 

For example? Test T at pos2? 

So a guess that has T at pos2? 

Similarly? 

So? Pattern: ? A T ? ?

But we must have S? 

So? 

For example? 

We could try ""PAYTS""? But not a word? 

""MATHS""? But M? A? But A at pos1? T at pos2? H? M? 

""MATHS"": M, A, T, H, S? 

Pattern: M A T H S? 

But T at pos2? 

Also? 

We need to avoid absent? Maths? M, A, T, H, S? All allowed? 

So? 

""MATHS"" is a word? 

Similarly? 

But in this? We test T? At pos2? And S? At pos4? But we have feedback: S? Cannot be at pos4? Because from tails? S was tested at pos4? And got minus? So S not at pos4? 

Therefore? ""MATHS"" has S at pos4? Which is forbidden? Because S cannot be at pos4? 

Therefore? We cannot use words with S at pos4? 

Similarly? 

Therefore? For the pattern: _ A T _ _ 

We need S? So S must be at pos3? Or pos0? 

But if? 

For pattern? 

Case? 

Pattern with T at pos2: 

Then S? At pos0: S A T ? ? -> like ""SATYR""? But R? Absent? 

Or S at pos3: which requires _ A T S ? 

So words? Any? 

For example: ""MATSY""? Not common? 

""HATSY""? Not a word? 

""PATSY"": P, A, T, S, Y? But we got? 

Wait? ""PATSY"" was considered? 

But ""PATSY"": P A T S Y? 

Pattern: P A T S Y? 

Now? T at pos2? And S at pos3? 

Both tested? 

Also? P? And Y? 

And avoid absent? Yes? 

Also? Is ""PATSY"" a valid word? Yes? Meaning a person who is easily taken advantage of? Or a scapegoat? 

So good? 

Similarly? 

But note: we get to test? 

Also? We haven't tested P or Y? 

So? 

Another? 

Similarly? Pattern with T at pos3: then word? _ A _ T _ 

And S? Must be at pos0 or pos2? 

If S at pos0: S A ? T ? 

Words: ""SAYTS""? Not word? 

""SAFTY""? Not common? 

""SAVOT""? No? 

Not many? 

If S at pos2: _ A S T _ 

Then words: ""HASTY"", ""NASTY"" but N absent? ""MASTY"" not word? ""PASTY"", ""TASTY""? 

""TASTY"": T? But cannot T at pos0? Because T cannot be at pos0? 

But let's check ""TASTY"": T(0), A(1), S(2), T(3), Y(4)? 

T at pos0? But we know T cannot be at pos0? Because in ""tails"" we guessed T at pos0? And got minus? So T not at pos0? So we cannot use ""TASTY""? 

Similarly? ""PASTY"": P A S T Y? 

Pattern: P(0), A(1), S(2), T(3), Y(4)? 

No T at pos0? 

So ""PASTY""? 

Yes? 

We can also use ""HASTY""? 

But ""HASTY"" and ""PASTY""? Both are words? 

Which? 

But note: we have already:

Pattern: with T at pos3: and S at pos2? 

Word: ... A S T ... 

So? 

Or T at pos2? And S at pos3? Word: ... A T S ... 

Both patterns are covered by:

- T at pos2, S at pos3: pattern _ A T S ? 
- T at pos3, S at pos2: pattern _ A S T ? 

In both cases? The fourth position? Must be filled? 

We have words? 

For _ A T S ? : ""PATSY"" 

For _ A S T ? : ""PASTY"", ""HASTY""? 

Now? 

We need to choose? 

We also note: we have not tested H and Y? But P? etc? 

So? 

But let's see? 

We can guess ""PASTY""? But? 

We have feedback? 

But to decide? 

Since we are not sure? But we have three possibilities? 

We can choose a word that covers one? 

But note? We are on guess 4? 

So? 

Let's pick ""PATSY""? 

Pattern: P A T S Y? 

We test:

T at pos2? 

S at pos3? 

P and Y? 

Then? Feedback? 

If we get: 

- If T at pos2? We might get check? 
- S at pos3? Check? 

Or minuses? 

But we know A at pos1? 

So? 

Therefore? We'll guess ""patsy""?

But let's see the word? 

<guess>patsy</guess> 

We'll see?Based on the feedback from all guesses:

- **Fixed Position:** A is confirmed at position 1 (index 1).
- **Present Letters:** A, T, and S are in the word, but:
  - T is NOT at positions 0 or 4 (from ""about"" and ""tails"").
  - S is NOT at position 4 (from ""tails"").
- **Absent Letters:** B, C, E, I, L, N, O, R, U (from all feedback, plus R, N, E, C, B, O, U, I, L).
- **Possible Positions for T and S:**  
  - T must be at index 2 or 3 (since positions 0, 1, and 4 are invalid/disqualified).  
  - S must be at index 0, 2, or 3 (since position 4 is invalid, and position 1 is occupied by A).
- **Word Structure:** `_ A _ _ _` with T and S required, plus two new letters from unused alphabet: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Given the constraints, **""patsy""** is chosen for Guess 4 because:
- **Tests Key Positions:**  
  - T at position 2 (to check if T is correctly placed here).  
  - S at position 3 (to check placement for S).  
- **Uses New Letters:** Introduces P and Y (untested letters).
- **Fits Constraints:**  
  - Includes A at position 1, T, and S.  
  - Excludes all absent letters.  
  - Valid English word (meaning ""a scapegoat"").

**Expected Insight:**  
- If T is at position 2, it will show as ✓.  
- If S is at position 3, it will show as ✓.  
- Minuses for T or S would confirm their positions are elsewhere, narrowing possibilities significantly.",Guess 4: patsy -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) A(✓) T(-) S(-) Y(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,pasty,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, etc.

 I recall that ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning the accumulated earnings of a company) and it uses common letters. However, let me check if it's valid.
 Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is a very common starting word.

 But note: the problem says the word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

 Another good one is ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.

 However, I think ""SLATE"" is also a top choice. It has S, L, A, T, E.

 Since we are at the first guess, any of these would be fine.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it covers 5 common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(-) -> A is in the word but not in the position we guessed (position 3 in ""crane"").
 N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.
 E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word does not contain C, R, N, E.
 - It does contain the letter A, but not in the third position.

 Since the secret word is 5 letters and contains A, but not in position 3 (index 2, if we start counting at 0), then A must be in one of the positions: 0, 1, 3, or 4.

 We also know that the letters C, R, N, E are absent. So we avoid these.

 For the next guess, we need:
 - A 5-letter word that includes the letter A (in a position other than the third) and excludes C, R, N, E.
 - We want to test other common letters and try to cover additional letters.

 Let's think of common letters that haven't been tested yet. Remaining frequent letters: T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 We also note that the word must have A in either position 0, 1, 3, or 4.

 Possible strategy: choose a word that has A in a different position and uses other common consonants and vowels.

 Example possibilities:
 - Place A in position 0: words like ""AUDIO"", ""ABOUT"" but note that we cannot use R (in ""ABOUT"", R is absent? Actually, we don't have R because R is excluded). Let's check our constraints.

 But wait: we have to avoid C, R, N, E. So:
 - ""ABOUT"": contains B, O, U, T. And A at position 0. Also, it doesn't contain C, R, N, E? It has A: yes, but we must check the letters: A, B, O, U, T. So R, C, N, E are absent -> acceptable.

 - Alternatively, place A at position 1: words like ""SALAD"" but that has repeated A? Also, L is allowed and common. But note: we don't have constraints on repeated letters? However, the feedback didn't show double A so we don't know if the secret has repeated letters. But ""SALAD"" has two A's? Actually, ""SALAD"" isn't 5 unique letters? Let me think: we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Considering the above, let's try to choose a word with:
   - A in a position that isn't 2, and not 2 (which we already know) but also avoid position 3? We don't know, so we can put it in any of {0,1,3,4}.
   - Also include other common vowels and consonants: T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 However, note the feedback for A: we got a minus, meaning it's in the word but in a different position. So we don't know where exactly.

 Let me try to consider: the secret word has A, and we don't have any other known letters? So let's try to cover more ground.

 Another candidate: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T. A is at position 2? Wait, position 2 is the third character -> that wouldn't work because we know A isn't at position 2? Actually, the third position in the word is index 2 (if 0-indexed: positions 0,1,2,3,4). So in ""crane"", A was at index 2. Therefore, we must place A at index 0,1,3, or 4.

 In ""PLAIT"", if we break it down:
   P (0), L (1), A (2) -> index 2 is not allowed? Actually, we cannot put A at index 2 because we know that in the secret word A is not at index 2. Therefore, we must choose a word where A is at a different index.

 ""PLAIT"" is invalid for our purpose because it has A at index 2.

 Let me think of another word: ""TABLE""? But E is excluded -> we cannot use E.

 ""TABBY""? But Y is a possibility. However, we want to avoid excluded letters: E is excluded, so we cannot use E. Also ""TABBY"" has B twice? Also, A is at index 1: that's allowed.

 But wait, ""TABBY"": T(0), A(1), B(2), B(3), Y(4). We are using A at index 1, which is acceptable. However, we have repeated B? We don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. But it's okay to guess repeated letters? However, we are limited by the fact that we must avoid C, R, N, E.

 Alternatively, we could use ""AVAIL""? But then we have V and two A's? And V is less common. Also, we are avoiding R? The word ""AVAIL"" doesn't have R, C, N, E? So allowed. But our goal is to cover new letters.

 Let me try to find a word that doesn't have A at index 2 and uses common letters.

 Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

 How about ""SALAD""? But that has two A's? Still, A at index 1 and 3? Also, it has L and D. But let's write: S(0), A(1), L(2), A(3), D(4). So A appears at index 1 (which is allowed) and index 3 (which is also allowed). But we don't know if the secret word has two A's? We can use it.

 But note: the feedback doesn't tell us if a letter appears more than once, unless we get multiple minuses or checks? Actually, the feedback per letter: if we guess two A's and there is one A in the secret, we might get one minus and one x? So it's okay to try.

 However, let's choose a more efficient word: a word that uses five new distinct letters including A? But A is required.

 We know A must be in the word, so we can choose a word that has A and four letters we haven't tried.

 Let me think: ""PLANT"" is not good because N is excluded? We cannot use N.

 How about ""PLAIT"" but we cannot use A at index 2? So we skip.

 Alternative: ""PASTA"" -> P, A, S, T, A -> two A's? But A at index 1 and 4? Actually, positions: index0: P, index1: A (allowed), index2: S, index3: T, index4: A (allowed). And no E, R, C, N? Actually, we are excluding C, R, N, E -> so P, A, S, T are okay? The word is valid.

 But let me check if ""PASTA"" is a valid English word? Yes.

 However, we haven't tried S, T, and P? That's good.

 Alternatively, ""TOAST"" -> but has T and O, but S. However, ""TOAST"" contains T twice? And A at index 2? Wait, index0:T, index1:O, index2:A? We cannot put A at index 2? So invalid.

 Instead, what about ""PAINT""? N is excluded? We cannot use N.

 Let me think: ""SLATE"" is not possible because E is excluded.

 How about ""BASIC""? Well, C is excluded? C is absent -> we cannot use C? But C is excluded? So no.

 Another: ""ABOUT"": A at index0? That's allowed: A(0), B(1), O(2), U(3), T(4). Letters: A, B, O, U, T. None of C, R, N, E? So it's valid.

 Also, ""ABOUT"" uses common vowels and consonants? Yes.

 Additionally, it uses B, O, U, T? We haven't checked these.

 Alternatively, ""ADIEU"" is not allowed because E is excluded.

 So ""ABOUT"" seems a good candidate.

 But note: what about ""AUDIO""? That has A at index0? A(0), U(1), D(2), I(3), O(4). Also, avoids excluded letters? Yes? It has D and I? And we avoid C, R, N, E? So yes.

 Let's compare:

 ""ABOUT"" vs ""AUDIO"": both contain A at index0, but which gives more information?

 We know the secret word has A? So in either word, we are testing:

 For ""ABOUT"": 
   Position0: A -> if it's correct we get check, if wrong we know A is not at 0? And similarly for the other letters.

 For ""AUDIO"": also tests U, D, I, O.

 But note: vowels are often in words? However, we already know that the secret contains A? Let's not forget that.

 I think both are acceptable.

 Another candidate: ""PATIO""? That has A at index1: P, A, T, I, O? That's also good? And it doesn't use excluded letters? Yes.

 Comparison of letters:

 ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T
 ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O
 ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O

 Which one? They all test A in a different position? Actually, ""ABOUT"" tests A at position0, ""PATIO"" tests A at position1, and ""AUDIO"" tests A at position0.

 Since we have no information about where A is (except that it's not at index2), testing A at a different position might be beneficial? We have already tested index2? So let's try index0 or index1?

 How about testing A in a position we haven't tested? Currently we only know about index2? So index0,1,3,4 are untested? We can choose any.

 Let me think: if we put A at index0 and it is correct, we get a check. If it is present but wrong position? Then we know it's in the word? We already know that? So it won't help? Actually, no: if we get a minus for A at index0, we know that A is in the word (we already know) but not at index0? So narrowing down.

 Similarly for index1.

 But also, we want to test new letters? So let's compare the sets:

 ""ABOUT"": tests B, O, U, T? All new.
 ""PATIO"": tests P, T, I, O? And A? Also new letters: P, T, I, O? Note that T and O are in ""ABOUT"", but ""ABOUT"" also has B and U? Both are equally good?

 However, ""ABOUT"" and ""PATIO"" both test 4 new letters? Actually, no: they share T and O? Actually, ""ABOUT"": letters [A, B, O, U, T] -> new: B, O, U, T. Also A? But we already know A? So effectively 4 new.

 Similarly, ""PATIO"": letters [P, A, T, I, O] -> new: P, T, I, O? We haven't tested T? Actually, we haven't tested T? Yes? So both are 4 new.

 But note: we are testing A again? Yes? Because we need to check its position? And we are forced to include A.

 Let me check ""AUDIO"": [A, U, D, I, O] -> new: U, D, I, O? Also 4 new.

 Which vowel combinations? Both are fine? What about consonants? 

 Let's think about frequency: in English, T is very common? So testing T might be good. Also, O is common.

 Actually, among the new letters: B, O, U, T, P, I, D? 

 We don't have much preference? But note: we have a constraint on A: it must be in one of the positions: 0,1,3,4? In ""ABOUT"", we test A at position0? If we get a minus, we know A is not at 0? Similarly for the letters in the other positions.

 So I think any of these words is acceptable.

 Let me go with ""ABOUT""? It tests A at position0? We haven't tried position0? So that could be beneficial? If we get a minus for A at position0, we rule it out? Then A must be in 1,3, or 4? 

 Alternatively, ""PATIO"" tests A at position1? 

 But note: in the secret word, A might be at position0? Then why not test position0? 

 So that makes sense? 

 Therefore, I'll choose ""ABOUT""? 

 Remember: we have to avoid excluded letters: ""ABOUT"" only uses A,B,O,U,T? And none of the excluded C,R,N,E? So good.

 Let me confirm: 
   A at index0: if correct? Will be marked check? If secret has A at a different position? Then marked minus? 
   Similarly, other letters.

 So I will go with ""ABOUT"".

 Alternatively, let me see if there is a word that doesn't have A at index0 or index2? Maybe test a position we haven't tested? We have tested index2? So ideally, we test index0,1,3,4? 

 How about testing A at index1? ""PATIO"" does that? So that's also good? Actually, both positions (0 and 1) are equally unknown.

 However, I recall that A is more common in the second position? For example, in 5-letter words? But no? Actually, no such bias? 

 So I'll pick ""ABOUT"" arbitrarily.

 But wait: what about the word ""SALAD""? It would test A at index1 and index3? But we are not forced to test multiple positions? Actually, that might be inefficient because we are using an extra A? And we only have 6 guesses? So probably better to test one A and many other letters.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""ABOUT"".

 Guess: ""ABOUT""

<guess>about</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- C, R, N, E are confirmed **absent** (x).
- A is present but not in position 2 (index 3 of the word, since indexing starts at 0). 
  
For the next guess, I need a word:
1. Includes A (in position 0, 1, 3, or 4).
2. Excludes C, R, N, E.
3. Uses new common letters (e.g., T, O, U, B, P, I) to maximize information gain.

Choosing **""about""**:
- Tests A at position 0 (new position).
- Introduces B, O, U, T (common letters not yet tested).
- Valid 5-letter word avoiding excluded letters.

This guess efficiently narrows down the position of A and checks new high-frequency letters.

<guess>about</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:

1. Guess ""crane"": 
   - C (x) -> absent
   - R (x) -> absent
   - A (-) -> present but not at position 2 (index 2 in zero-based indexing, which is the third character). So A is in the word but not at index 2.
   - N (x) -> absent
   - E (x) -> absent

2. Guess ""about"":
   - A (-) -> present but not at position 0 (index 0). So we now know A is not at index 0 and index 2? Yes.
   - B (x) -> absent
   - O (x) -> absent
   - U (x) -> absent
   - T (-) -> present but not at position 4? ""about"" has T at index 4. So T is in the secret word but not at index 4.

So let's compile the information:

**Absent letters (x):** C, R, N, E, B, O, U 
**Must-include letters (known):** A and T are in the word? Because both have feedback ""-"" meaning they are present.

But note: in both guesses:
- In ""crane"": A is present? Yes (minuses) but not at index 2.
- In ""about"": A is present? Yes (but not at index 0) and T is present? But not at index 4? So T is in the secret word? Yes.

Also note: The word does not contain C, R, N, E, B, O, U.

Therefore, the secret word must contain at least A and T? And must not contain the excluded letters? 

However, we have only identified 2 letters? The word is 5 letters? So there are 3 more? But note: T's presence is confirmed? And A's presence is confirmed? And we have excluded 7 letters? 

But wait: we have 26 letters? We can try to find a word that has A and T? Plus three new letters? Also, we must place A and T correctly? 

From feedback:
- A cannot be at index 0 (from ""about"") and index 2 (from ""crane"")? So possible positions for A: only index 1, 3, or 4? 
- T cannot be at index 4? From ""about""? Also, we don't know about T? So T could be at indices: 0, 1, 2, 3? But not 4? 

Now, we need to choose a new guess that:
- Must include both A and T? Because they are known to be in the word? 
- Must exclude C, R, N, E, B, O, U? 
- Also, we have to consider positions: A cannot be at index0 or index2? T cannot be at index4? 

So A must be at position: 1, 3, or 4? 
T must be at position: 0,1,2,3? 

Possible next guess: we can try a word that has A and T? And try to test a position for A? And also try other common letters? 

Also, we haven't tried letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

We want to pick a word that uses A and T? And three new letters? Also, we should place A at one of the possible positions: 1,3,4? Similarly T at any position except 4? And verify it doesn't have any excluded letter? 

But note: we haven't detected any double letters? But it's possible? 

We can try to cover common letters: for example, S, L, I, D, M, etc? 

Candidate words? 

First, with A at a new possible position? Let's try A at index1: for example? Or index3? 

But we don't know? So we might want to test a position? And also test new letters? 

For example: 
- How about ""SALTY""? But S? and L? But we must exclude O? We don't have excluded? But O is excluded? So we cannot use O? ""SALTY"" has O? Wait, no? SALTY: S, A, L, T, Y? 

But check excluded? O is excluded? But ""SALTY"" doesn't have O? So it's okay? 

But wait: we also must not use: C,R,N,E,B,O,U? So ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y -> none are excluded? So it's valid? 

In ""SALTY"":
- A is at index1?
- T is at index3? 

Also, S, L, Y are new letters? 

But positions:
If we pick ""SALTY"":
   Index0: S
   Index1: A? -> now, we know A cannot be at index1? Or we test it: if correct, we get check? If not, then we know A isn't at index1? So we narrow? 

Similarly T: at index3? Which is allowed? 

We also get to test S at index0? L at index2? Y at index4? 

But note: the feedback for T? We have T? Already? So we can see if T is placed correctly at index3? Or elsewhere? 

But wait: we know T is present? But not at index4? Now we are testing T at index3? So we might get information? 

So ""SALTY"" is possible? 

But note: what about the secret word? It might have T at other positions? 

Alternative: perhaps ""PATSY""? But P? And S? But A at index1? T at index2? And S? And Y? 

But no excluded letters? 

""PATSY"": P, A, T, S, Y? 

That also: 
- A at index1? 
- T at index2? 

But we haven't tried index2 for T? It's possible? 

However, note: for A? We haven't tried index1? So both words test A at index1? 

But ""SALTY""? Also tests L? And Y? Which are good? 

But let me see? Another candidate: ""TASTY""? But T repeated? We have two T's? And A at index1? T at index0 and index3? 

But we don't have issue? 

We will consider? 

However, our goal? We don't know if there are repeated letters? 

But we can choose? 

But note: ""SALTY"" and ""PATSY"" are both candidates? 

Also ""DAISY""? But D? A? I? S? Y? But A in ""DAISY"" is at index1? But also excludes? We don't have excluded? 

But wait: ""DAISY""? Actually, D(0), A(1), I(2), S(3), Y(4). 

But we just want to test A at index1? 

But note: we know T must be in the word? And ""DAISY"" does not have T? So we must include T? 

Therefore, we cannot guess ""DAISY""? Because we know the word must contain T? And ""DAISY"" doesn't have T? So that would be invalid? 

Similarly, our guess must include A? We know A is in the word? And must include T? 

So we have to include both? 

Therefore, words without T are invalid? 

So ""SALTY"" has T? Yes. 
""PATSY"" has T? Yes? 

What are other possibilities? 

How about ""MATCH""? But C? Excluded? 

How about ""PASTA""? But E excluded? No? But P, A, S, T, A? Has S and T? But A repeated? Also, O? No? But O is excluded? In PASTA? No? But we don't have O? It has P, A, S, T, A? 

But A at index1 and index4? 

But ""PASTA"": index0:P, index1:A, index2:S, index3:T, index4:A? 

And excluded: we must avoid C,R,N,E,B,O,U? So:
P: ok
A: ok
S: ok
T: ok
A: ok? 

But the excluded list: we have to avoid C,R,N,E,B,O,U? So ""PASTA"" uses P, A, S, T? No excluded letters? 

So ""PASTA"" is acceptable? 

In ""PASTA"": 
- A? At index1 and 4? We test A at index1 and index4? 
- T? At index3? 

But we are testing A and T? Plus S and P? 

But note: if we guess ""PASTA"", and if A is only once in the secret? We might get one minus and one x? So that narrows? 

Similarly, we haven't tested S or P? 

But let's compare ""SALTY"" and ""PASTA"": 

- ""SALTY"": letters used: S, A, L, T, Y? 
- ""PASTA"": letters used: P, A, S, T, A? So testing P and S? And also L? But ""SALTY"" tests Y? 

We haven't tested L? So SALTY tests L? PASTA tests P and S? 

We haven't tested S? 

But note: we also haven't tested P? 

But S is more common? 

However, both are acceptable? 

Let me think: we know A is in one of the positions 1,3,4? 

In ""SALTY"", we test A at position1? Which is one candidate? 
In ""PASTA"", we test A at positions1 and also4? 

But we have two A's? Might be wasteful? 

So? 

Alternatively, what about ""TAILS""? But A at index1? And T at index0? 

""TAILS"": T(0), A(1), I(2), L(3), S(4)? 

But then T? At index0? And S? And I, L? 

But we haven't excluded I,L,S? 

Also, T? We know T is in the word? 

But in ""TAILS"": T at index0? We haven't tested that position? So if T? At index0? 

Also, A at index1? 

So ""TAILS"" tests T at index0? And A at index1? Both? 

Similarly? 

And L at index3? S at index4? 

We also avoid excluded? 

So let me choose between ""SALTY"", ""PATSY"", ""PASTA"", ""TAILS""? 

""PATSY"": P, A, T, S, Y? Also? 

But let me list:

- ""SALTY"": S(0), A(1), L(2), T(3), Y(4) -> tests A at position1? And T at position3? 

- ""PATSY"": P(0), A(1), T(2), S(3), Y(4) -> tests A at position1? T at position2? 

- ""TAILS"": T(0), A(1), I(2), L(3), S(4) -> tests A at position1? T at position0? 

- ""PASTA"": P(0), A(1), S(2), T(3), A(4) -> tests A at positions1 and4? T at position3? 

Now note: in the secret word, T cannot be at index4? But we already tested T at index4? So excluding that position? 

We want to test T at new positions? 

Similarly, A? 

In ""TAILS"": T at index0? We haven't tested T at index0? So we can get whether T is at that position? 

Similarly, in ""PATSY"": T at index2? 

So? 

Also, common letters: S, L, T? 

I'll pick ""TAILS"" for the next guess? Why? 

Because we test T at a new position (index0)? We haven't tested T at index0? Or index1? Or index2? Or index3? Only excluded index4? 

So testing index0 might be useful? 

Similarly, A at index1? 

In ""TAILS""? 

We are offering I and L? Which are vowels? But consonants also? 

It includes five new letters: T, A, I, L, S? But T and A are known? So effectively testing I, L, S? 

So ""TAILS"" 

Therefore? 

Guess: ""tails""? 

But note: T at index0 and A at index1? 

We then expect feedback: either T might be correct? Or A? Or both? 

Also, we might get minuses? 

We can then use that information? 

So decided: ""TAILS"" 

Confirm: ""tails"" is a valid English word? It means the hindmost part of an animal? Or to follow? But in plural? Yes, as a noun? 

Also, in Wordle? It would be accepted? 

So <guess>tails</guess> 

But note: we have to write the guess? 

But let me think? 

Alternatively, ""STAIN""? But N? Excluded? Cannot. 

Therefore, I'll proceed with ""tails"". 

<guess>tails</guess>Based on the feedback:
- **Absent letters (x):** C, R, N, E, B, O, U  
  → Excluded from future guesses.
- **Confirmed present letters:** A and T are in the secret word.  
  - **A:** Not at position 0 (from ""about"") or position 2 (from ""crane"").  
  - **T:** Not at position 4 (from ""about"").
- **Possible positions:**  
  - **A:** Must be at index 1, 3, or 4 (0-based).  
  - **T:** Must be at index 0, 1, 2, or 3 (not 4).

For the next guess, the word must:
1. Include **A** and **T** (since they are confirmed present).
2. Exclude the absent letters (C, R, N, E, B, O, U).
3. Test new high-frequency letters (not yet attempted), such as S, L, I, D, G, H.
4. Ideally, position **A** at an untested position (1, 3, or 4) and **T** at an untested position (0, 1, 2, or 3) to gather more information.

Chosen guess: **""tails""**  
- Composition: T (index 0), A (index 1), I (index 2), L (index 3), S (index 4).  
- Why this word?  
  - Tests **A** at the new position 1 (previously untested positions were 0 and 2).  
  - Tests **T** at the new position 0 (only position 4 has been tested).  
  - Introduces new common letters: I, L, S (all untested and high-frequency).  
  - Avoids excluded letters.  
- Potential outcomes:  
  - If **A** is at position 1, feedback will show ✓.  
  - If **T** is at position 0, feedback will show ✓.  
  - Otherwise, minuses will help narrow positions for A/T while confirming other letters in the word.

This guess efficiently narrows possible positions for A and T while covering new letters.

<guess>tails</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(-)
Guess 3: tails -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(✓) I(x) L(x) S(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Interpretation:
- C, R, N, E are absent (not in the word).
- A is present but not in position 2 (index 2).

Guess 2: about -> Feedback: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(-)
Interpretation:
- A is present but not in position 0 (since ""about"" has A at index 0).
- B, O, U are absent.
- T is present but not in position 4 (since ""about"" has T at index 4).

Guess 3: tails -> Feedback: T(-) A(✓) I(x) L(x) S(-)
Interpretation:
- T is present but not in position 0 (since ""tails"" has T at index 0).
- A is correct and in the correct position (index 1), because we got a check at A in ""tails"" (position 1).
- I and L are absent.
- S is present but not in position 4 (since ""tails"" has S at index 4).

Now, let's summarize what we know:

1. Correctly placed letters:
   - A is at position 1 (index 1, second letter).

2. Present letters (in the word, but not necessarily in the correct position):
   - T: present, but not at index 0 (from ""tails"") and not at index 4 (from ""about""). Also, from ""tails"", T is not at index 0, and we know it must be in the word somewhere else.
   - S: present, but not at index 4 (from ""tails"").

3. Absent letters:
   From Guess 1: C, R, N, E
   From Guess 2: B, O, U
   From Guess 3: I, L
   So absent: B, C, E, I, L, N, O, R, U.

   Therefore, the remaining possible letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. Structure of the word:
   We know the second letter is A: _ A _ _ _

   The word must contain at least T and S (besides A), but note that T and S are confirmed to be present. Also, there could be other letters.

5. Positions for T and S:
   - T cannot be at index 0 or 4. Possible positions: index 1? But index 1 is occupied by A? So T cannot be at index 1 either? Because A is there? Therefore, T must be at index 2 or 3? 
   - Similarly, S cannot be at index 4? But it can be at index 0, 2, or 3? However, index 1 is occupied, so S cannot be there either? So S at 0,2,3.

But note: we don't know if T or S can be at the same position? We have 5 distinct positions? And each position must be filled.

So the word structure:

Positions: 0, 1=A, 2, 3, 4.

T must be at index 2 or 3? (not 0,1,4)

S must be at index 0,2,3? (not 4, and since index1 is taken, only 0,2,3 available? But T is also to be placed? So possible overlap? Or not? But T and S are distinct? So they can't occupy the same slot? However, we don't know if there are other letters? 

Actually, we have:

The word has A at index 1? And contains T and S? But we don't know the other two letters? Because the word is 5 letters? So we need to find a word that has form: 

- Position1: A
- Contains T and S? And two other letters from the remaining alphabet? And excludes the absent letters.

We also note: T must be in the word? And we haven't placed T? Similarly for S? 

So possible patterns? 

Pattern: 
Index0: ? (could be S or another letter)
Index1: A (fixed)
Index2: ? (could be T, or S, or another letter? but T can be here? or S? etc.)
Index3: ? 
Index4: ? (not S? but S is present? So index4 cannot be S? but index4 could be T? However, we know T is not at index4? So index4 is neither T nor S? So either the letter at index4 is not T and not S? But we have two more letters to find? 

Actually, let's list:

We know:

- The word must have: A (at pos1), T (somewhere? but not pos0,4? and not pos1? so pos2 or 3), and S? (somewhere? not pos4? and not pos1? so pos0,2,3).

But note: we don't know if T and S are the only other letters? There are two more? 

So word: ? A ? ? ? 

We have:

- T must be in pos2 or pos3?
- S must be in pos0, or pos2, or pos3?

But pos2 and pos3 can only hold one letter each? So if both T and S are to be placed? And if we put T at pos2? Then S can be at pos0 or pos3? Similarly, if T at pos3? S at pos0 or pos2? 

But also? The remaining position? We have position4? Which must be a letter that is not T? And not S? And must be one of the remaining letters? 

Therefore, possible arrangements:

Case 1: T at pos2? Then S at pos0 or pos3? 

But we also have pos4? 

Case 2: T at pos3? Then S at pos0 or pos2? 

Plus? Whatever? We have the other positions? 

But we need to guess a word that uses A at position1? And places T and S? And the other two letters? Which we haven't guessed? 

What about the feedback? 

We also note: S was present in ""tails"" and T was present? And we tested? 

Now? We need to choose a new word? 

First: we know the word must have A at position1? And T and S? Plus two more letters? 

The two more letters must be from: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

We can choose? 

But note: we also want to test possible positions for T and S? 

We already know T cannot be at pos0 and pos4? So only pos2 or 3? Similarly S? Cannot be at pos4? So pos0,2,3? 

We also haven't placed S or T? 

So? Guess: Try a word that has T? Maybe at pos2? Or pos3? And S? 

We also want to test other common letters? 

But we are constrained? 

For example: let's try to set T at pos2? Then? 

Pattern: T at pos2: ? A T ? ? 

But we must have S? And one more? 

And pattern: S must be at pos0 or pos3 or pos4? But S cannot be at pos4? Because? From tails? Feedback: S(-) and we guessed at pos4? So S not at 4? So S must be at pos0 or pos3? 

But we also have T at pos2? So:

If T at pos2? Then:
- S at pos0? Then pattern: S A T ? ? 
- or S at pos3? Then pattern: ? A T S ?

But what about the last two positions? 

We don't know? 

Similarly? If T at pos3? Then T at pos3? And S at pos0 or pos2? 

But we must fill position4? 

So? 

Possible guesses? 

We can try both? 

Note: we have excluded some letters? But we haven't tried: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

But common letters? We want to choose common words? 

How about ""SATYR""? But R? Absent? So cannot? 

How about ""SATIN""? But N? Absent? 

How about ""SATAY""? But A repeated? And Y? But let's see? 

But S? We can try a word starting with S? 

Pattern: S A _ _ _

And T? We can place at 2? Or 3? 

But we have T? So? 

And we need two more letters? 

How about ""SATED""? But E? Absent? 

How about ""SATYR""? But R? Absent? 

So? 

How about without S? But S must be present? So we have to include? 

Therefore? 

Perhaps ""SAVAS""? But V? And repeated A? But let's? 

But we need T? Where is T? 

We must include T? 

So? 

Therefore? 

We need a word having A at pos1? And containing T and S? 

And not having absent letters? 

Let's list? Words: 

Pattern: S A T ? ? : but then T? We can? 

But does T have to be there? 

Let's see? 

For example: ""SATES""? But E? And S repeated? E? Absent? 

In ""SATES"": S, A, T, E, S? E is absent? 

Not allowed? 

""SATYR"": S, A, T, Y, R? R? Absent? 

""SATIN"": S, A, T, I, N? N absent? And I absent? 

So no? 

Pattern: ? A S ? ?

We could place T? 

For example? 

If S is at pos2? Then word: _ A S _ _

Pattern? 

And T? Must be at pos3? Because we cannot put T at pos0? Because? We know T is present? And available positions left: pos0,3,4? But we can put T at pos3? Because we don't know? 

And S at pos2? 

So pattern: _ A S T ? 

Then? We have to find a letter for pos0? And pos4? And exclude absent letters? 

So word: X A S T Y? 

Where X and Y are from the remaining alphabet? 

What words? Like ""HASTY""? But H? And Y? 

Also? Check absent? 

""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> no excluded letters? 

Similarly? Other words: ""MASTY""? Probably not a word? 

""PASTY""? But P? That's a word? Meaning of or like paste? 

But ""PASTY"" is accepted? 

But we can also have? 

Wait? What about ""PASTE""? But E? Absent? 

Therefore? 

""HASTY"" or ""PASTY""? 

But we also have option: S at pos0? 

Then word: S A ? ? ? 

With T? At pos2 or 3? 

So? 

Pattern: S A T ? ? -> words? 

""SATAY""? Is it a word? Satay? It's a dish? Often spelled S-A-T-A-Y? 

But we have constraints: pos0=S, pos1=A, pos2=T, pos3=A? But A repeated? And Y? 

But also? We have T? 

But ""SATAY"": S,A,T,A,Y? 

Check absent? We avoid B,C,E,I,L,N,O,R,U? So S,A,T,Y are okay? 

Also? Position4: must be Y? 

Is ""SATAY"" a valid English word? Yes? 

But let's compare: 

Option 1: ""HASTY"": pattern: H A S T Y? 
But we have S at pos2? 

And T at pos3? 

We tested S? We guessed S? But we don't know? 

Similarly? 

Option 2: ""SATAY"": pattern: S A T A Y? 

But also? 

Option 3: ""PASTY"": pattern: P A S T Y? 

Here? S at pos2? T at pos3? 

And P? 

These are possible? 

But we also have the constraint? In ""HASTY""? 

We need to choose one? 

We know? From ""tails""? We got S(-)? So S is present? But we don't know where? Similarly T? 

But we want to test? For example? 

In ""HASTY"", we can test:

If S is at index2? Then we might get a minus? Or even a check? 

Similarly? 

But let me think: we haven't tested H? So if we guess ""HASTY"", we are testing H? Which is unknown? 

Similarly? 

Alternatively? We know the secret? 

But we must include T? 

Also? We can also consider? 

But note: we have only 6 guesses? And we are on the third guess? So we have three more? 

So? We can guess? 

But we have A placed? 

We can also consider: the position of T or S? 

In the previous guess? We tested T at pos0? And we got a minus? So T not at 0? Now? We want to test? 

For example? Test T at pos2? 

So a guess that has T at pos2? 

Similarly? 

So? Pattern: ? A T ? ?

But we must have S? 

So? 

For example? 

We could try ""PAYTS""? But not a word? 

""MATHS""? But M? A? But A at pos1? T at pos2? H? M? 

""MATHS"": M, A, T, H, S? 

Pattern: M A T H S? 

But T at pos2? 

Also? 

We need to avoid absent? Maths? M, A, T, H, S? All allowed? 

So? 

""MATHS"" is a word? 

Similarly? 

But in this? We test T? At pos2? And S? At pos4? But we have feedback: S? Cannot be at pos4? Because from tails? S was tested at pos4? And got minus? So S not at pos4? 

Therefore? ""MATHS"" has S at pos4? Which is forbidden? Because S cannot be at pos4? 

Therefore? We cannot use words with S at pos4? 

Similarly? 

Therefore? For the pattern: _ A T _ _ 

We need S? So S must be at pos3? Or pos0? 

But if? 

For pattern? 

Case? 

Pattern with T at pos2: 

Then S? At pos0: S A T ? ? -> like ""SATYR""? But R? Absent? 

Or S at pos3: which requires _ A T S ? 

So words? Any? 

For example: ""MATSY""? Not common? 

""HATSY""? Not a word? 

""PATSY"": P, A, T, S, Y? But we got? 

Wait? ""PATSY"" was considered? 

But ""PATSY"": P A T S Y? 

Pattern: P A T S Y? 

Now? T at pos2? And S at pos3? 

Both tested? 

Also? P? And Y? 

And avoid absent? Yes? 

Also? Is ""PATSY"" a valid word? Yes? Meaning a person who is easily taken advantage of? Or a scapegoat? 

So good? 

Similarly? 

But note: we get to test? 

Also? We haven't tested P or Y? 

So? 

Another? 

Similarly? Pattern with T at pos3: then word? _ A _ T _ 

And S? Must be at pos0 or pos2? 

If S at pos0: S A ? T ? 

Words: ""SAYTS""? Not word? 

""SAFTY""? Not common? 

""SAVOT""? No? 

Not many? 

If S at pos2: _ A S T _ 

Then words: ""HASTY"", ""NASTY"" but N absent? ""MASTY"" not word? ""PASTY"", ""TASTY""? 

""TASTY"": T? But cannot T at pos0? Because T cannot be at pos0? 

But let's check ""TASTY"": T(0), A(1), S(2), T(3), Y(4)? 

T at pos0? But we know T cannot be at pos0? Because in ""tails"" we guessed T at pos0? And got minus? So T not at pos0? So we cannot use ""TASTY""? 

Similarly? ""PASTY"": P A S T Y? 

Pattern: P(0), A(1), S(2), T(3), Y(4)? 

No T at pos0? 

So ""PASTY""? 

Yes? 

We can also use ""HASTY""? 

But ""HASTY"" and ""PASTY""? Both are words? 

Which? 

But note: we have already:

Pattern: with T at pos3: and S at pos2? 

Word: ... A S T ... 

So? 

Or T at pos2? And S at pos3? Word: ... A T S ... 

Both patterns are covered by:

- T at pos2, S at pos3: pattern _ A T S ? 
- T at pos3, S at pos2: pattern _ A S T ? 

In both cases? The fourth position? Must be filled? 

We have words? 

For _ A T S ? : ""PATSY"" 

For _ A S T ? : ""PASTY"", ""HASTY""? 

Now? 

We need to choose? 

We also note: we have not tested H and Y? But P? etc? 

So? 

But let's see? 

We can guess ""PASTY""? But? 

We have feedback? 

But to decide? 

Since we are not sure? But we have three possibilities? 

We can choose a word that covers one? 

But note? We are on guess 4? 

So? 

Let's pick ""PATSY""? 

Pattern: P A T S Y? 

We test:

T at pos2? 

S at pos3? 

P and Y? 

Then? Feedback? 

If we get: 

- If T at pos2? We might get check? 
- S at pos3? Check? 

Or minuses? 

But we know A at pos1? 

So? 

Therefore? We'll guess ""patsy""?

But let's see the word? 

<guess>patsy</guess> 

We'll see?Based on the feedback from all guesses:

- **Fixed Position:** A is confirmed at position 1 (index 1).
- **Present Letters:** A, T, and S are in the word, but:
  - T is NOT at positions 0 or 4 (from ""about"" and ""tails"").
  - S is NOT at position 4 (from ""tails"").
- **Absent Letters:** B, C, E, I, L, N, O, R, U (from all feedback, plus R, N, E, C, B, O, U, I, L).
- **Possible Positions for T and S:**  
  - T must be at index 2 or 3 (since positions 0, 1, and 4 are invalid/disqualified).  
  - S must be at index 0, 2, or 3 (since position 4 is invalid, and position 1 is occupied by A).
- **Word Structure:** `_ A _ _ _` with T and S required, plus two new letters from unused alphabet: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Given the constraints, **""patsy""** is chosen for Guess 4 because:
- **Tests Key Positions:**  
  - T at position 2 (to check if T is correctly placed here).  
  - S at position 3 (to check placement for S).  
- **Uses New Letters:** Introduces P and Y (untested letters).
- **Fits Constraints:**  
  - Includes A at position 1, T, and S.  
  - Excludes all absent letters.  
  - Valid English word (meaning ""a scapegoat"").

**Expected Insight:**  
- If T is at position 2, it will show as ✓.  
- If S is at position 3, it will show as ✓.  
- Minuses for T or S would confirm their positions are elsewhere, narrowing possibilities significantly.

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.\n Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n Let me think: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, etc.\n\n I recall that ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning the accumulated earnings of a company) and it uses common letters. However, let me check if it\'s valid.\n Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is a very common starting word.\n\n But note: the problem says the word must be a valid 5-letter English word.\n\n Another good one is ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.\n\n However, I think ""SLATE"" is also a top choice. It has S, L, A, T, E.\n\n Since we are at the first guess, any of these would be fine.\n\n Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it covers 5 common letters: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n So, my first guess will be: CRANE.\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":\n C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.\n R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.\n A(-) -> A is in the word but not in the position we guessed (position 3 in ""crane"").\n N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.\n E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.\n\n Therefore, we know:\n - The secret word does not contain C, R, N, E.\n - It does contain the letter A, but not in the third position.\n\n Since the secret word is 5 letters and contains A, but not in position 3 (index 2, if we start counting at 0), then A must be in one of the positions: 0, 1, 3, or 4.\n\n We also know that the letters C, R, N, E are absent. So we avoid these.\n\n For the next guess, we need:\n - A 5-letter word that includes the letter A (in a position other than the third) and excludes C, R, N, E.\n - We want to test other common letters and try to cover additional letters.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that haven\'t been tested yet. Remaining frequent letters: T, O, I, S, L, etc.\n\n We also note that the word must have A in either position 0, 1, 3, or 4.\n\n Possible strategy: choose a word that has A in a different position and uses other common consonants and vowels.\n\n Example possibilities:\n - Place A in position 0: words like ""AUDIO"", ""ABOUT"" but note that we cannot use R (in ""ABOUT"", R is absent? Actually, we don\'t have R because R is excluded). Let\'s check our constraints.\n\n But wait: we have to avoid C, R, N, E. So:\n - ""ABOUT"": contains B, O, U, T. And A at position 0. Also, it doesn\'t contain C, R, N, E? It has A: yes, but we must check the letters: A, B, O, U, T. So R, C, N, E are absent -> acceptable.\n\n - Alternatively, place A at position 1: words like ""SALAD"" but that has repeated A? Also, L is allowed and common. But note: we don\'t have constraints on repeated letters? However, the feedback didn\'t show double A so we don\'t know if the secret has repeated letters. But ""SALAD"" has two A\'s? Actually, ""SALAD"" isn\'t 5 unique letters? Let me think: we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Considering the above, let\'s try to choose a word with:\n   - A in a position that isn\'t 2, and not 2 (which we already know) but also avoid position 3? We don\'t know, so we can put it in any of {0,1,3,4}.\n   - Also include other common vowels and consonants: T, O, I, S, L, etc.\n\n However, note the feedback for A: we got a minus, meaning it\'s in the word but in a different position. So we don\'t know where exactly.\n\n Let me try to consider: the secret word has A, and we don\'t have any other known letters? So let\'s try to cover more ground.\n\n Another candidate: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T. A is at position 2? Wait, position 2 is the third character -> that wouldn\'t work because we know A isn\'t at position 2? Actually, the third position in the word is index 2 (if 0-indexed: positions 0,1,2,3,4). So in ""crane"", A was at index 2. Therefore, we must place A at index 0,1,3, or 4.\n\n In ""PLAIT"", if we break it down:\n   P (0), L (1), A (2) -> index 2 is not allowed? Actually, we cannot put A at index 2 because we know that in the secret word A is not at index 2. Therefore, we must choose a word where A is at a different index.\n\n ""PLAIT"" is invalid for our purpose because it has A at index 2.\n\n Let me think of another word: ""TABLE""? But E is excluded -> we cannot use E.\n\n ""TABBY""? But Y is a possibility. However, we want to avoid excluded letters: E is excluded, so we cannot use E. Also ""TABBY"" has B twice? Also, A is at index 1: that\'s allowed.\n\n But wait, ""TABBY"": T(0), A(1), B(2), B(3), Y(4). We are using A at index 1, which is acceptable. However, we have repeated B? We don\'t know if the secret word has repeated letters. But it\'s okay to guess repeated letters? However, we are limited by the fact that we must avoid C, R, N, E.\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""AVAIL""? But then we have V and two A\'s? And V is less common. Also, we are avoiding R? The word ""AVAIL"" doesn\'t have R, C, N, E? So allowed. But our goal is to cover new letters.\n\n Let me try to find a word that doesn\'t have A at index 2 and uses common letters.\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.\n\n How about ""SALAD""? But that has two A\'s? Still, A at index 1 and 3? Also, it has L and D. But let\'s write: S(0), A(1), L(2), A(3), D(4). So A appears at index 1 (which is allowed) and index 3 (which is also allowed). But we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s? We can use it.\n\n But note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us if a letter appears more than once, unless we get multiple minuses or checks? Actually, the feedback per letter: if we guess two A\'s and there is one A in the secret, we might get one minus and one x? So it\'s okay to try.\n\n However, let\'s choose a more efficient word: a word that uses five new distinct letters including A? But A is required.\n\n We know A must be in the word, so we can choose a word that has A and four letters we haven\'t tried.\n\n Let me think: ""PLANT"" is not good because N is excluded? We cannot use N.\n\n How about ""PLAIT"" but we cannot use A at index 2? So we skip.\n\n Alternative: ""PASTA"" -> P, A, S, T, A -> two A\'s? But A at index 1 and 4? Actually, positions: index0: P, index1: A (allowed), index2: S, index3: T, index4: A (allowed). And no E, R, C, N? Actually, we are excluding C, R, N, E -> so P, A, S, T are okay? The word is valid.\n\n But let me check if ""PASTA"" is a valid English word? Yes.\n\n However, we haven\'t tried S, T, and P? That\'s good.\n\n Alternatively, ""TOAST"" -> but has T and O, but S. However, ""TOAST"" contains T twice? And A at index 2? Wait, index0:T, index1:O, index2:A? We cannot put A at index 2? So invalid.\n\n Instead, what about ""PAINT""? N is excluded? We cannot use N.\n\n Let me think: ""SLATE"" is not possible because E is excluded.\n\n How about ""BASIC""? Well, C is excluded? C is absent -> we cannot use C? But C is excluded? So no.\n\n Another: ""ABOUT"": A at index0? That\'s allowed: A(0), B(1), O(2), U(3), T(4). Letters: A, B, O, U, T. None of C, R, N, E? So it\'s valid.\n\n Also, ""ABOUT"" uses common vowels and consonants? Yes.\n\n Additionally, it uses B, O, U, T? We haven\'t checked these.\n\n Alternatively, ""ADIEU"" is not allowed because E is excluded.\n\n So ""ABOUT"" seems a good candidate.\n\n But note: what about ""AUDIO""? That has A at index0? A(0), U(1), D(2), I(3), O(4). Also, avoids excluded letters? Yes? It has D and I? And we avoid C, R, N, E? So yes.\n\n Let\'s compare:\n\n ""ABOUT"" vs ""AUDIO"": both contain A at index0, but which gives more information?\n\n We know the secret word has A? So in either word, we are testing:\n\n For ""ABOUT"": \n   Position0: A -> if it\'s correct we get check, if wrong we know A is not at 0? And similarly for the other letters.\n\n For ""AUDIO"": also tests U, D, I, O.\n\n But note: vowels are often in words? However, we already know that the secret contains A? Let\'s not forget that.\n\n I think both are acceptable.\n\n Another candidate: ""PATIO""? That has A at index1: P, A, T, I, O? That\'s also good? And it doesn\'t use excluded letters? Yes.\n\n Comparison of letters:\n\n ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T\n ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O\n ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O\n\n Which one? They all test A in a different position? Actually, ""ABOUT"" tests A at position0, ""PATIO"" tests A at position1, and ""AUDIO"" tests A at position0.\n\n Since we have no information about where A is (except that it\'s not at index2), testing A at a different position might be beneficial? We have already tested index2? So let\'s try index0 or index1?\n\n How about testing A in a position we haven\'t tested? Currently we only know about index2? So index0,1,3,4 are untested? We can choose any.\n\n Let me think: if we put A at index0 and it is correct, we get a check. If it is present but wrong position? Then we know it\'s in the word? We already know that? So it won\'t help? Actually, no: if we get a minus for A at index0, we know that A is in the word (we already know) but not at index0? So narrowing down.\n\n Similarly for index1.\n\n But also, we want to test new letters? So let\'s compare the sets:\n\n ""ABOUT"": tests B, O, U, T? All new.\n ""PATIO"": tests P, T, I, O? And A? Also new letters: P, T, I, O? Note that T and O are in ""ABOUT"", but ""ABOUT"" also has B and U? Both are equally good?\n\n However, ""ABOUT"" and ""PATIO"" both test 4 new letters? Actually, no: they share T and O? Actually, ""ABOUT"": letters [A, B, O, U, T] -> new: B, O, U, T. Also A? But we already know A? So effectively 4 new.\n\n Similarly, ""PATIO"": letters [P, A, T, I, O] -> new: P, T, I, O? We haven\'t tested T? Actually, we haven\'t tested T? Yes? So both are 4 new.\n\n But note: we are testing A again? Yes? Because we need to check its position? And we are forced to include A.\n\n Let me check ""AUDIO"": [A, U, D, I, O] -> new: U, D, I, O? Also 4 new.\n\n Which vowel combinations? Both are fine? What about consonants? \n\n Let\'s think about frequency: in English, T is very common? So testing T might be good. Also, O is common.\n\n Actually, among the new letters: B, O, U, T, P, I, D? \n\n We don\'t have much preference? But note: we have a constraint on A: it must be in one of the positions: 0,1,3,4? In ""ABOUT"", we test A at position0? If we get a minus, we know A is not at 0? Similarly for the letters in the other positions.\n\n So I think any of these words is acceptable.\n\n Let me go with ""ABOUT""? It tests A at position0? We haven\'t tried position0? So that could be beneficial? If we get a minus for A at position0, we rule it out? Then A must be in 1,3, or 4? \n\n Alternatively, ""PATIO"" tests A at position1? \n\n But note: in the secret word, A might be at position0? Then why not test position0? \n\n So that makes sense? \n\n Therefore, I\'ll choose ""ABOUT""? \n\n Remember: we have to avoid excluded letters: ""ABOUT"" only uses A,B,O,U,T? And none of the excluded C,R,N,E? So good.\n\n Let me confirm: \n   A at index0: if correct? Will be marked check? If secret has A at a different position? Then marked minus? \n   Similarly, other letters.\n\n So I will go with ""ABOUT"".\n\n Alternatively, let me see if there is a word that doesn\'t have A at index0 or index2? Maybe test a position we haven\'t tested? We have tested index2? So ideally, we test index0,1,3,4? \n\n How about testing A at index1? ""PATIO"" does that? So that\'s also good? Actually, both positions (0 and 1) are equally unknown.\n\n However, I recall that A is more common in the second position? For example, in 5-letter words? But no? Actually, no such bias? \n\n So I\'ll pick ""ABOUT"" arbitrarily.\n\n But wait: what about the word ""SALAD""? It would test A at index1 and index3? But we are not forced to test multiple positions? Actually, that might be inefficient because we are using an extra A? And we only have 6 guesses? So probably better to test one A and many other letters.\n\n Therefore, I\'ll go with ""ABOUT"".\n\n Guess: ""ABOUT""\n\n<guess>about</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": \n- C, R, N, E are confirmed **absent** (x).\n- A is present but not in position 2 (index 3 of the word, since indexing starts at 0). \n  \nFor the next guess, I need a word:\n1. Includes A (in position 0, 1, 3, or 4).\n2. Excludes C, R, N, E.\n3. Uses new common letters (e.g., T, O, U, B, P, I) to maximize information gain.\n\nChoosing **""about""**:\n- Tests A at position 0 (new position).\n- Introduces B, O, U, T (common letters not yet tested).\n- Valid 5-letter word avoiding excluded letters.\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down the position of A and checks new high-frequency letters.\n\n<guess>about</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two sets of feedback:\n\n1. Guess ""crane"": \n   - C (x) -> absent\n   - R (x) -> absent\n   - A (-) -> present but not at position 2 (index 2 in zero-based indexing, which is the third character). So A is in the word but not at index 2.\n   - N (x) -> absent\n   - E (x) -> absent\n\n2. Guess ""about"":\n   - A (-) -> present but not at position 0 (index 0). So we now know A is not at index 0 and index 2? Yes.\n   - B (x) -> absent\n   - O (x) -> absent\n   - U (x) -> absent\n   - T (-) -> present but not at position 4? ""about"" has T at index 4. So T is in the secret word but not at index 4.\n\nSo let\'s compile the information:\n\n**Absent letters (x):** C, R, N, E, B, O, U \n**Must-include letters (known):** A and T are in the word? Because both have feedback ""-"" meaning they are present.\n\nBut note: in both guesses:\n- In ""crane"": A is present? Yes (minuses) but not at index 2.\n- In ""about"": A is present? Yes (but not at index 0) and T is present? But not at index 4? So T is in the secret word? Yes.\n\nAlso note: The word does not contain C, R, N, E, B, O, U.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must contain at least A and T? And must not contain the excluded letters? \n\nHowever, we have only identified 2 letters? The word is 5 letters? So there are 3 more? But note: T\'s presence is confirmed? And A\'s presence is confirmed? And we have excluded 7 letters? \n\nBut wait: we have 26 letters? We can try to find a word that has A and T? Plus three new letters? Also, we must place A and T correctly? \n\nFrom feedback:\n- A cannot be at index 0 (from ""about"") and index 2 (from ""crane"")? So possible positions for A: only index 1, 3, or 4? \n- T cannot be at index 4? From ""about""? Also, we don\'t know about T? So T could be at indices: 0, 1, 2, 3? But not 4? \n\nNow, we need to choose a new guess that:\n- Must include both A and T? Because they are known to be in the word? \n- Must exclude C, R, N, E, B, O, U? \n- Also, we have to consider positions: A cannot be at index0 or index2? T cannot be at index4? \n\nSo A must be at position: 1, 3, or 4? \nT must be at position: 0,1,2,3? \n\nPossible next guess: we can try a word that has A and T? And try to test a position for A? And also try other common letters? \n\nAlso, we haven\'t tried letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z? \n\nWe want to pick a word that uses A and T? And three new letters? Also, we should place A at one of the possible positions: 1,3,4? Similarly T at any position except 4? And verify it doesn\'t have any excluded letter? \n\nBut note: we haven\'t detected any double letters? But it\'s possible? \n\nWe can try to cover common letters: for example, S, L, I, D, M, etc? \n\nCandidate words? \n\nFirst, with A at a new possible position? Let\'s try A at index1: for example? Or index3? \n\nBut we don\'t know? So we might want to test a position? And also test new letters? \n\nFor example: \n- How about ""SALTY""? But S? and L? But we must exclude O? We don\'t have excluded? But O is excluded? So we cannot use O? ""SALTY"" has O? Wait, no? SALTY: S, A, L, T, Y? \n\nBut check excluded? O is excluded? But ""SALTY"" doesn\'t have O? So it\'s okay? \n\nBut wait: we also must not use: C,R,N,E,B,O,U? So ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y -> none are excluded? So it\'s valid? \n\nIn ""SALTY"":\n- A is at index1?\n- T is at index3? \n\nAlso, S, L, Y are new letters? \n\nBut positions:\nIf we pick ""SALTY"":\n   Index0: S\n   Index1: A? -> now, we know A cannot be at index1? Or we test it: if correct, we get check? If not, then we know A isn\'t at index1? So we narrow? \n\nSimilarly T: at index3? Which is allowed? \n\nWe also get to test S at index0? L at index2? Y at index4? \n\nBut note: the feedback for T? We have T? Already? So we can see if T is placed correctly at index3? Or elsewhere? \n\nBut wait: we know T is present? But not at index4? Now we are testing T at index3? So we might get information? \n\nSo ""SALTY"" is possible? \n\nBut note: what about the secret word? It might have T at other positions? \n\nAlternative: perhaps ""PATSY""? But P? And S? But A at index1? T at index2? And S? And Y? \n\nBut no excluded letters? \n\n""PATSY"": P, A, T, S, Y? \n\nThat also: \n- A at index1? \n- T at index2? \n\nBut we haven\'t tried index2 for T? It\'s possible? \n\nHowever, note: for A? We haven\'t tried index1? So both words test A at index1? \n\nBut ""SALTY""? Also tests L? And Y? Which are good? \n\nBut let me see? Another candidate: ""TASTY""? But T repeated? We have two T\'s? And A at index1? T at index0 and index3? \n\nBut we don\'t have issue? \n\nWe will consider? \n\nHowever, our goal? We don\'t know if there are repeated letters? \n\nBut we can choose? \n\nBut note: ""SALTY"" and ""PATSY"" are both candidates? \n\nAlso ""DAISY""? But D? A? I? S? Y? But A in ""DAISY"" is at index1? But also excludes? We don\'t have excluded? \n\nBut wait: ""DAISY""? Actually, D(0), A(1), I(2), S(3), Y(4). \n\nBut we just want to test A at index1? \n\nBut note: we know T must be in the word? And ""DAISY"" does not have T? So we must include T? \n\nTherefore, we cannot guess ""DAISY""? Because we know the word must contain T? And ""DAISY"" doesn\'t have T? So that would be invalid? \n\nSimilarly, our guess must include A? We know A is in the word? And must include T? \n\nSo we have to include both? \n\nTherefore, words without T are invalid? \n\nSo ""SALTY"" has T? Yes. \n""PATSY"" has T? Yes? \n\nWhat are other possibilities? \n\nHow about ""MATCH""? But C? Excluded? \n\nHow about ""PASTA""? But E excluded? No? But P, A, S, T, A? Has S and T? But A repeated? Also, O? No? But O is excluded? In PASTA? No? But we don\'t have O? It has P, A, S, T, A? \n\nBut A at index1 and index4? \n\nBut ""PASTA"": index0:P, index1:A, index2:S, index3:T, index4:A? \n\nAnd excluded: we must avoid C,R,N,E,B,O,U? So:\nP: ok\nA: ok\nS: ok\nT: ok\nA: ok? \n\nBut the excluded list: we have to avoid C,R,N,E,B,O,U? So ""PASTA"" uses P, A, S, T? No excluded letters? \n\nSo ""PASTA"" is acceptable? \n\nIn ""PASTA"": \n- A? At index1 and 4? We test A at index1 and index4? \n- T? At index3? \n\nBut we are testing A and T? Plus S and P? \n\nBut note: if we guess ""PASTA"", and if A is only once in the secret? We might get one minus and one x? So that narrows? \n\nSimilarly, we haven\'t tested S or P? \n\nBut let\'s compare ""SALTY"" and ""PASTA"": \n\n- ""SALTY"": letters used: S, A, L, T, Y? \n- ""PASTA"": letters used: P, A, S, T, A? So testing P and S? And also L? But ""SALTY"" tests Y? \n\nWe haven\'t tested L? So SALTY tests L? PASTA tests P and S? \n\nWe haven\'t tested S? \n\nBut note: we also haven\'t tested P? \n\nBut S is more common? \n\nHowever, both are acceptable? \n\nLet me think: we know A is in one of the positions 1,3,4? \n\nIn ""SALTY"", we test A at position1? Which is one candidate? \nIn ""PASTA"", we test A at positions1 and also4? \n\nBut we have two A\'s? Might be wasteful? \n\nSo? \n\nAlternatively, what about ""TAILS""? But A at index1? And T at index0? \n\n""TAILS"": T(0), A(1), I(2), L(3), S(4)? \n\nBut then T? At index0? And S? And I, L? \n\nBut we haven\'t excluded I,L,S? \n\nAlso, T? We know T is in the word? \n\nBut in ""TAILS"": T at index0? We haven\'t tested that position? So if T? At index0? \n\nAlso, A at index1? \n\nSo ""TAILS"" tests T at index0? And A at index1? Both? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nAnd L at index3? S at index4? \n\nWe also avoid excluded? \n\nSo let me choose between ""SALTY"", ""PATSY"", ""PASTA"", ""TAILS""? \n\n""PATSY"": P, A, T, S, Y? Also? \n\nBut let me list:\n\n- ""SALTY"": S(0), A(1), L(2), T(3), Y(4) -> tests A at position1? And T at position3? \n\n- ""PATSY"": P(0), A(1), T(2), S(3), Y(4) -> tests A at position1? T at position2? \n\n- ""TAILS"": T(0), A(1), I(2), L(3), S(4) -> tests A at position1? T at position0? \n\n- ""PASTA"": P(0), A(1), S(2), T(3), A(4) -> tests A at positions1 and4? T at position3? \n\nNow note: in the secret word, T cannot be at index4? But we already tested T at index4? So excluding that position? \n\nWe want to test T at new positions? \n\nSimilarly, A? \n\nIn ""TAILS"": T at index0? We haven\'t tested T at index0? So we can get whether T is at that position? \n\nSimilarly, in ""PATSY"": T at index2? \n\nSo? \n\nAlso, common letters: S, L, T? \n\nI\'ll pick ""TAILS"" for the next guess? Why? \n\nBecause we test T at a new position (index0)? We haven\'t tested T at index0? Or index1? Or index2? Or index3? Only excluded index4? \n\nSo testing index0 might be useful? \n\nSimilarly, A at index1? \n\nIn ""TAILS""? \n\nWe are offering I and L? Which are vowels? But consonants also? \n\nIt includes five new letters: T, A, I, L, S? But T and A are known? So effectively testing I, L, S? \n\nSo ""TAILS"" \n\nTherefore? \n\nGuess: ""tails""? \n\nBut note: T at index0 and A at index1? \n\nWe then expect feedback: either T might be correct? Or A? Or both? \n\nAlso, we might get minuses? \n\nWe can then use that information? \n\nSo decided: ""TAILS"" \n\nConfirm: ""tails"" is a valid English word? It means the hindmost part of an animal? Or to follow? But in plural? Yes, as a noun? \n\nAlso, in Wordle? It would be accepted? \n\nSo <guess>tails</guess> \n\nBut note: we have to write the guess? \n\nBut let me think? \n\nAlternatively, ""STAIN""? But N? Excluded? Cannot. \n\nTherefore, I\'ll proceed with ""tails"". \n\n<guess>tails</guess>Based on the feedback:\n- **Absent letters (x):** C, R, N, E, B, O, U  \n  → Excluded from future guesses.\n- **Confirmed present letters:** A and T are in the secret word.  \n  - **A:** Not at position 0 (from ""about"") or position 2 (from ""crane"").  \n  - **T:** Not at position 4 (from ""about"").\n- **Possible positions:**  \n  - **A:** Must be at index 1, 3, or 4 (0-based).  \n  - **T:** Must be at index 0, 1, 2, or 3 (not 4).\n\nFor the next guess, the word must:\n1. Include **A** and **T** (since they are confirmed present).\n2. Exclude the absent letters (C, R, N, E, B, O, U).\n3. Test new high-frequency letters (not yet attempted), such as S, L, I, D, G, H.\n4. Ideally, position **A** at an untested position (1, 3, or 4) and **T** at an untested position (0, 1, 2, or 3) to gather more information.\n\nChosen guess: **""tails""**  \n- Composition: T (index 0), A (index 1), I (index 2), L (index 3), S (index 4).  \n- Why this word?  \n  - Tests **A** at the new position 1 (previously untested positions were 0 and 2).  \n  - Tests **T** at the new position 0 (only position 4 has been tested).  \n  - Introduces new common letters: I, L, S (all untested and high-frequency).  \n  - Avoids excluded letters.  \n- Potential outcomes:  \n  - If **A** is at position 1, feedback will show ✓.  \n  - If **T** is at position 0, feedback will show ✓.  \n  - Otherwise, minuses will help narrow positions for A/T while confirming other letters in the word.\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows possible positions for A and T while covering new letters.\n\n<guess>tails</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(-)\nGuess 3: tails -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(✓) I(x) L(x) S(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nInterpretation:\n- C, R, N, E are absent (not in the word).\n- A is present but not in position 2 (index 2).\n\nGuess 2: about -> Feedback: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(-)\nInterpretation:\n- A is present but not in position 0 (since ""about"" has A at index 0).\n- B, O, U are absent.\n- T is present but not in position 4 (since ""about"" has T at index 4).\n\nGuess 3: tails -> Feedback: T(-) A(✓) I(x) L(x) S(-)\nInterpretation:\n- T is present but not in position 0 (since ""tails"" has T at index 0).\n- A is correct and in the correct position (index 1), because we got a check at A in ""tails"" (position 1).\n- I and L are absent.\n- S is present but not in position 4 (since ""tails"" has S at index 4).\n\nNow, let\'s summarize what we know:\n\n1. Correctly placed letters:\n   - A is at position 1 (index 1, second letter).\n\n2. Present letters (in the word, but not necessarily in the correct position):\n   - T: present, but not at index 0 (from ""tails"") and not at index 4 (from ""about""). Also, from ""tails"", T is not at index 0, and we know it must be in the word somewhere else.\n   - S: present, but not at index 4 (from ""tails"").\n\n3. Absent letters:\n   From Guess 1: C, R, N, E\n   From Guess 2: B, O, U\n   From Guess 3: I, L\n   So absent: B, C, E, I, L, N, O, R, U.\n\n   Therefore, the remaining possible letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n4. Structure of the word:\n   We know the second letter is A: _ A _ _ _\n\n   The word must contain at least T and S (besides A), but note that T and S are confirmed to be present. Also, there could be other letters.\n\n5. Positions for T and S:\n   - T cannot be at index 0 or 4. Possible positions: index 1? But index 1 is occupied by A? So T cannot be at index 1 either? Because A is there? Therefore, T must be at index 2 or 3? \n   - Similarly, S cannot be at index 4? But it can be at index 0, 2, or 3? However, index 1 is occupied, so S cannot be there either? So S at 0,2,3.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if T or S can be at the same position? We have 5 distinct positions? And each position must be filled.\n\nSo the word structure:\n\nPositions: 0, 1=A, 2, 3, 4.\n\nT must be at index 2 or 3? (not 0,1,4)\n\nS must be at index 0,2,3? (not 4, and since index1 is taken, only 0,2,3 available? But T is also to be placed? So possible overlap? Or not? But T and S are distinct? So they can\'t occupy the same slot? However, we don\'t know if there are other letters? \n\nActually, we have:\n\nThe word has A at index 1? And contains T and S? But we don\'t know the other two letters? Because the word is 5 letters? So we need to find a word that has form: \n\n- Position1: A\n- Contains T and S? And two other letters from the remaining alphabet? And excludes the absent letters.\n\nWe also note: T must be in the word? And we haven\'t placed T? Similarly for S? \n\nSo possible patterns? \n\nPattern: \nIndex0: ? (could be S or another letter)\nIndex1: A (fixed)\nIndex2: ? (could be T, or S, or another letter? but T can be here? or S? etc.)\nIndex3: ? \nIndex4: ? (not S? but S is present? So index4 cannot be S? but index4 could be T? However, we know T is not at index4? So index4 is neither T nor S? So either the letter at index4 is not T and not S? But we have two more letters to find? \n\nActually, let\'s list:\n\nWe know:\n\n- The word must have: A (at pos1), T (somewhere? but not pos0,4? and not pos1? so pos2 or 3), and S? (somewhere? not pos4? and not pos1? so pos0,2,3).\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if T and S are the only other letters? There are two more? \n\nSo word: ? A ? ? ? \n\nWe have:\n\n- T must be in pos2 or pos3?\n- S must be in pos0, or pos2, or pos3?\n\nBut pos2 and pos3 can only hold one letter each? So if both T and S are to be placed? And if we put T at pos2? Then S can be at pos0 or pos3? Similarly, if T at pos3? S at pos0 or pos2? \n\nBut also? The remaining position? We have position4? Which must be a letter that is not T? And not S? And must be one of the remaining letters? \n\nTherefore, possible arrangements:\n\nCase 1: T at pos2? Then S at pos0 or pos3? \n\nBut we also have pos4? \n\nCase 2: T at pos3? Then S at pos0 or pos2? \n\nPlus? Whatever? We have the other positions? \n\nBut we need to guess a word that uses A at position1? And places T and S? And the other two letters? Which we haven\'t guessed? \n\nWhat about the feedback? \n\nWe also note: S was present in ""tails"" and T was present? And we tested? \n\nNow? We need to choose a new word? \n\nFirst: we know the word must have A at position1? And T and S? Plus two more letters? \n\nThe two more letters must be from: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? \n\nWe can choose? \n\nBut note: we also want to test possible positions for T and S? \n\nWe already know T cannot be at pos0 and pos4? So only pos2 or 3? Similarly S? Cannot be at pos4? So pos0,2,3? \n\nWe also haven\'t placed S or T? \n\nSo? Guess: Try a word that has T? Maybe at pos2? Or pos3? And S? \n\nWe also want to test other common letters? \n\nBut we are constrained? \n\nFor example: let\'s try to set T at pos2? Then? \n\nPattern: T at pos2: ? A T ? ? \n\nBut we must have S? And one more? \n\nAnd pattern: S must be at pos0 or pos3 or pos4? But S cannot be at pos4? Because? From tails? Feedback: S(-) and we guessed at pos4? So S not at 4? So S must be at pos0 or pos3? \n\nBut we also have T at pos2? So:\n\nIf T at pos2? Then:\n- S at pos0? Then pattern: S A T ? ? \n- or S at pos3? Then pattern: ? A T S ?\n\nBut what about the last two positions? \n\nWe don\'t know? \n\nSimilarly? If T at pos3? Then T at pos3? And S at pos0 or pos2? \n\nBut we must fill position4? \n\nSo? \n\nPossible guesses? \n\nWe can try both? \n\nNote: we have excluded some letters? But we haven\'t tried: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? \n\nBut common letters? We want to choose common words? \n\nHow about ""SATYR""? But R? Absent? So cannot? \n\nHow about ""SATIN""? But N? Absent? \n\nHow about ""SATAY""? But A repeated? And Y? But let\'s see? \n\nBut S? We can try a word starting with S? \n\nPattern: S A _ _ _\n\nAnd T? We can place at 2? Or 3? \n\nBut we have T? So? \n\nAnd we need two more letters? \n\nHow about ""SATED""? But E? Absent? \n\nHow about ""SATYR""? But R? Absent? \n\nSo? \n\nHow about without S? But S must be present? So we have to include? \n\nTherefore? \n\nPerhaps ""SAVAS""? But V? And repeated A? But let\'s? \n\nBut we need T? Where is T? \n\nWe must include T? \n\nSo? \n\nTherefore? \n\nWe need a word having A at pos1? And containing T and S? \n\nAnd not having absent letters? \n\nLet\'s list? Words: \n\nPattern: S A T ? ? : but then T? We can? \n\nBut does T have to be there? \n\nLet\'s see? \n\nFor example: ""SATES""? But E? And S repeated? E? Absent? \n\nIn ""SATES"": S, A, T, E, S? E is absent? \n\nNot allowed? \n\n""SATYR"": S, A, T, Y, R? R? Absent? \n\n""SATIN"": S, A, T, I, N? N absent? And I absent? \n\nSo no? \n\nPattern: ? A S ? ?\n\nWe could place T? \n\nFor example? \n\nIf S is at pos2? Then word: _ A S _ _\n\nPattern? \n\nAnd T? Must be at pos3? Because we cannot put T at pos0? Because? We know T is present? And available positions left: pos0,3,4? But we can put T at pos3? Because we don\'t know? \n\nAnd S at pos2? \n\nSo pattern: _ A S T ? \n\nThen? We have to find a letter for pos0? And pos4? And exclude absent letters? \n\nSo word: X A S T Y? \n\nWhere X and Y are from the remaining alphabet? \n\nWhat words? Like ""HASTY""? But H? And Y? \n\nAlso? Check absent? \n\n""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> no excluded letters? \n\nSimilarly? Other words: ""MASTY""? Probably not a word? \n\n""PASTY""? But P? That\'s a word? Meaning of or like paste? \n\nBut ""PASTY"" is accepted? \n\nBut we can also have? \n\nWait? What about ""PASTE""? But E? Absent? \n\nTherefore? \n\n""HASTY"" or ""PASTY""? \n\nBut we also have option: S at pos0? \n\nThen word: S A ? ? ? \n\nWith T? At pos2 or 3? \n\nSo? \n\nPattern: S A T ? ? -> words? \n\n""SATAY""? Is it a word? Satay? It\'s a dish? Often spelled S-A-T-A-Y? \n\nBut we have constraints: pos0=S, pos1=A, pos2=T, pos3=A? But A repeated? And Y? \n\nBut also? We have T? \n\nBut ""SATAY"": S,A,T,A,Y? \n\nCheck absent? We avoid B,C,E,I,L,N,O,R,U? So S,A,T,Y are okay? \n\nAlso? Position4: must be Y? \n\nIs ""SATAY"" a valid English word? Yes? \n\nBut let\'s compare: \n\nOption 1: ""HASTY"": pattern: H A S T Y? \nBut we have S at pos2? \n\nAnd T at pos3? \n\nWe tested S? We guessed S? But we don\'t know? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nOption 2: ""SATAY"": pattern: S A T A Y? \n\nBut also? \n\nOption 3: ""PASTY"": pattern: P A S T Y? \n\nHere? S at pos2? T at pos3? \n\nAnd P? \n\nThese are possible? \n\nBut we also have the constraint? In ""HASTY""? \n\nWe need to choose one? \n\nWe know? From ""tails""? We got S(-)? So S is present? But we don\'t know where? Similarly T? \n\nBut we want to test? For example? \n\nIn ""HASTY"", we can test:\n\nIf S is at index2? Then we might get a minus? Or even a check? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nBut let me think: we haven\'t tested H? So if we guess ""HASTY"", we are testing H? Which is unknown? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nAlternatively? We know the secret? \n\nBut we must include T? \n\nAlso? We can also consider? \n\nBut note: we have only 6 guesses? And we are on the third guess? So we have three more? \n\nSo? We can guess? \n\nBut we have A placed? \n\nWe can also consider: the position of T or S? \n\nIn the previous guess? We tested T at pos0? And we got a minus? So T not at 0? Now? We want to test? \n\nFor example? Test T at pos2? \n\nSo a guess that has T at pos2? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nSo? Pattern: ? A T ? ?\n\nBut we must have S? \n\nSo? \n\nFor example? \n\nWe could try ""PAYTS""? But not a word? \n\n""MATHS""? But M? A? But A at pos1? T at pos2? H? M? \n\n""MATHS"": M, A, T, H, S? \n\nPattern: M A T H S? \n\nBut T at pos2? \n\nAlso? \n\nWe need to avoid absent? Maths? M, A, T, H, S? All allowed? \n\nSo? \n\n""MATHS"" is a word? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nBut in this? We test T? At pos2? And S? At pos4? But we have feedback: S? Cannot be at pos4? Because from tails? S was tested at pos4? And got minus? So S not at pos4? \n\nTherefore? ""MATHS"" has S at pos4? Which is forbidden? Because S cannot be at pos4? \n\nTherefore? We cannot use words with S at pos4? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nTherefore? For the pattern: _ A T _ _ \n\nWe need S? So S must be at pos3? Or pos0? \n\nBut if? \n\nFor pattern? \n\nCase? \n\nPattern with T at pos2: \n\nThen S? At pos0: S A T ? ? -> like ""SATYR""? But R? Absent? \n\nOr S at pos3: which requires _ A T S ? \n\nSo words? Any? \n\nFor example: ""MATSY""? Not common? \n\n""HATSY""? Not a word? \n\n""PATSY"": P, A, T, S, Y? But we got? \n\nWait? ""PATSY"" was considered? \n\nBut ""PATSY"": P A T S Y? \n\nPattern: P A T S Y? \n\nNow? T at pos2? And S at pos3? \n\nBoth tested? \n\nAlso? P? And Y? \n\nAnd avoid absent? Yes? \n\nAlso? Is ""PATSY"" a valid word? Yes? Meaning a person who is easily taken advantage of? Or a scapegoat? \n\nSo good? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nBut note: we get to test? \n\nAlso? We haven\'t tested P or Y? \n\nSo? \n\nAnother? \n\nSimilarly? Pattern with T at pos3: then word? _ A _ T _ \n\nAnd S? Must be at pos0 or pos2? \n\nIf S at pos0: S A ? T ? \n\nWords: ""SAYTS""? Not word? \n\n""SAFTY""? Not common? \n\n""SAVOT""? No? \n\nNot many? \n\nIf S at pos2: _ A S T _ \n\nThen words: ""HASTY"", ""NASTY"" but N absent? ""MASTY"" not word? ""PASTY"", ""TASTY""? \n\n""TASTY"": T? But cannot T at pos0? Because T cannot be at pos0? \n\nBut let\'s check ""TASTY"": T(0), A(1), S(2), T(3), Y(4)? \n\nT at pos0? But we know T cannot be at pos0? Because in ""tails"" we guessed T at pos0? And got minus? So T not at pos0? So we cannot use ""TASTY""? \n\nSimilarly? ""PASTY"": P A S T Y? \n\nPattern: P(0), A(1), S(2), T(3), Y(4)? \n\nNo T at pos0? \n\nSo ""PASTY""? \n\nYes? \n\nWe can also use ""HASTY""? \n\nBut ""HASTY"" and ""PASTY""? Both are words? \n\nWhich? \n\nBut note: we have already:\n\nPattern: with T at pos3: and S at pos2? \n\nWord: ... A S T ... \n\nSo? \n\nOr T at pos2? And S at pos3? Word: ... A T S ... \n\nBoth patterns are covered by:\n\n- T at pos2, S at pos3: pattern _ A T S ? \n- T at pos3, S at pos2: pattern _ A S T ? \n\nIn both cases? The fourth position? Must be filled? \n\nWe have words? \n\nFor _ A T S ? : ""PATSY"" \n\nFor _ A S T ? : ""PASTY"", ""HASTY""? \n\nNow? \n\nWe need to choose? \n\nWe also note: we have not tested H and Y? But P? etc? \n\nSo? \n\nBut let\'s see? \n\nWe can guess ""PASTY""? But? \n\nWe have feedback? \n\nBut to decide? \n\nSince we are not sure?

We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(- N(x) E(x)
- C, R, N, E absent.
- A present but not at position 2.

Guess 2: about -> Feedback: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(-)
- A present but not at position 0? (since A was guessed at position 0) and we also know not at position 2? So A not at 0 or 2? 
- B, O, U absent.
- T present but not at position 4.

Guess 3: tails -> Feedback: T(-) A(✓) I(x) L(x) S(-)
- T present but not at position 0.
- A is correct at position 1? So the second letter is A.
- I, L absent.
- S present but not at position 4. 

Guess 4: patsy -> Feedback: P(✓) A(✓) T(-) S(-) Y(✓)
- P is correct at position 0? (since ""patsy"" has P at position 0) and we get ✓.
- A is correct at position 1? And we already knew? 
- T is present but not at position 2? Because guessed at position 2? 
- S is present but not at position 3? 
- Y is correct at position 4? So the last letter is Y.

So now we know:
- The word has P at position 0? A at position 1? Y at position 4? So the word is P A _ _ Y

And we know:
- T and S are present? But T is not at position 2? And not at position 0, 4? And position 1 is occupied? So T must be at position 3? Because positions 0,1,2,4 are taken or forbidden? Similarly, S? S must be at position 2? Because positions 0,1,3,4: we have S not at position 3? (from ""patsy"")? And from ""tails""? S(-) at position 4? So S not at 4? Also, position 0 is P? Position 1 is A? Position 4 is Y? So the only positions left? Are position 2 and 3? 

But for S? We have feedback: in ""patsy""? Position 3: S(-) so S not at 3? Similarly? From tail? Position 4: S not at 4? Also? Position 1 is A? Position 0 is P? So S must be at position 2? 

Similarly? For T? We know T must be present? And not at position 0? From tails? Not at position 2? From patsy? Not at position 4? So T must be at position 3? 

Therefore? The word is P A S T Y? But S at position 2? And T at position 3? 

But wait? In ""patsy""? We get T(-) for position 2? But in ""pasty""? We placed S and T at other positions? 

But let's reconcile? 

From ""patsy"": 
- Pattern: P A T S Y? 
But T was guessed at position 2? Got minus? Meaning T present but not here? 
Similarly? S at position 3? Got minus? 

But we also know that Y? Got check? At position 4? 

Therefore? Word: P A _ _ Y? 

And we have T present? But not at position 2? 
And S present? But not at position 3? 

Now? The missing positions are 2 and 3? 

So we need letters for position 2 and 3? 

But we also have T and S must be in the word? So they must fill positions 2 and 3? 

Specifically? S cannot be at position 3? So S must be at position 2? 
T cannot be at position 2? So T must be at position 3? 

Therefore? The secret word is P A S T Y? 

But if so? Then in ""patsy"": 
- We guessed P A T S Y? 
But the actual word is P A S T Y? 

Then feedback would be:
P(✓), A(✓), T: we guessed at position 2? But actual is at position 3? So T should be minus? And S? We guessed at position 3? But actual is at position 2? So S should also be minus? 

Which matches the feedback? 

And Y(✓)? 

Also? Confirm? 

Therefore? The word is PASTY? 

But PASTY: P A S T Y? Such as Cornish pasty? 

But let's check? 

In ""patsy"", we guessed P A T S Y? And we got P(✓), A(✓), T(-), S(-), Y(✓)? Meaning the actual word has P, A, Y at those positions? But T and S are present? Just swapped positions? 

So if T and S are swapped? Then the word must be ""PASTY""? 

Therefore? We win? 

But we have to guess it? 

Next guess? 

We have two guesses left? But if we guess ""pasty""? 

We know? 

But note: we have only 5-letters? 

So yes? 

Therefore? Guess: pasty

### Key Constraints:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 0: **P**  
  - Position 1: **A**  
  - Position 4: **Y**  
  → Structure: **P A _ _ Y**  
- **Present letters**: **T** and **S** must fill positions 2 and 3 (only options left).  
  - **T cannot be at position 2** (feedback: `T(-)` in Guess 4), so **T must be at position 3**.  
  - **S cannot be at position 3** (feedback: `S(-)` in Guess 4), so **S must be at position 2**.  
- **Absent letters**: B, C, E, I, L, N, O, R, U.  
- **Resulting word**: **P A S T Y**.

### Next Guess:
- Only one word fits: **pasty** (valid English word meaning a type of pastry).  
- This guess completes the word with **S** at position 2 and **T** at position 3.
