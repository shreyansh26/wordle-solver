We are starting the game. We have no feedback yet. We need to make an initial guess.
 A common strategy is to choose a word that includes several common letters to gather information.
 For the first guess, it's often good to pick a word with unique letters and including vowels and common consonants.
 I recall that words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", ""STARE"" are good starting words because they have common letters.
 But note: we need a 5-letter word. Let me choose ""RAISE"" because it has two vowels (A, I) and common consonants (R, S).
 However, another popular starting word is ""CRANE"". Let me consider that.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 Important: We are making the first guess. So we have no prior feedback.

 Our goal is to maximize information. 

 I decide to go with ""CRANE"".

 So the guess is: CRANE

 But note: We are to return the word in the format: <guess>CRANE</guess>
</think>
Considering the first guess, a strategic approach is to maximize information about common letters. A word with diverse, frequently used letters can help identify letters in the secret word. 

Key criteria:
- Include common vowels (A, E) and consonants (R, S, T).
- Avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
- Prioritize words with high-frequency letters in English.

**Optimal starting words**: Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" fit these criteria. Among these, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because:
- It covers three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
- Letters like C, R, and N appear in many 5-letter words.
- It avoids rare letters (J, Q, Z), increasing the chance of feedback hits.

This guess will provide immediate feedback on vowels and consonants, helping to narrow down the secret word efficiently.

We are given feedback on the first guess ""CRANE"": 
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So we know:
- The secret word has an 'R' in the second position.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Since A and E are vowels and they are not in the word, we must consider other vowels: O, U, I, and sometimes Y. But we have to choose a word that excludes C, A, N, E and includes R in the second position.

Also, the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

We can use this information to make our second guess.

Important: We need to try a word that has new letters to test and confirms the R in the second position.

Strategy for second guess:
- Keep R in the second position.
- Avoid using C, A, N, E.
- Include other common letters to test, such as S, T, L, O, I, etc.

Possible words: 
We need words with the pattern: _ R _ _ _

Considering common letters, let's try to include vowels that haven't been tested: O, U, I.

For example:
- ""PROUD"" (P, R, O, U, D) --> Here we test O and U.
- ""BROIL"" (B, R, O, I, L) --> Tests O and I.
- ""TRUST"" (T, R, U, S, T) --> repeated T? Better avoid repetition for now.

But note: we haven't tested letters like T, S, L, etc. 

Another idea: We know the word must have an R in the middle. Common words: 

Let's list some words fitting _ R _ _ _ and not containing C, A, N, E.

Options:
- ""BRUSH"": B, R, U, S, H → U and S are new, also H.
- ""FROST"": F, R, O, S, T → O, S, T are new → but S and T are very common.
- ""GRIPE"": G, R, I, P, E → oh, E is not allowed because we know E is not in the word. So avoid E.
- ""PRISM"": P, R, I, S, M → I and S are new.

We must avoid A, C, N, E.

So let's choose a word that covers as many new letters as possible.

Considering frequency: S, T, L, O, I are common.

We can try ""PROUD"":
- P, R, O, U, D → tests O, U, P, D.

But S and T are still untested.

Alternatively, ""TRIPS"": T, R, I, P, S → tests T, I, P, S → but P and S? Not sure.

Another good one: ""FROST"" → F, R, O, S, T → tests F, O, S, T → F is less common, but O, S, T are common.

Or ""SHORT"": S, H, O, R, T → no, because R must be second? Here R is fourth? Not correct pattern.

We need the R in the second position: so word is [letter] R [three letters].

So ""SHORT"" is S H O R T → positions: 1:S, 2:H (not R) → wrong, because R must be second? In the feedback, R was at position 2 in CRANE and it was correct, so in the secret word second letter is R, so pattern: ? R ? ? ?

Therefore, ""SHORT"" doesn't fit because R is at position 4? Actually in ""SHORT"": positions are:
Pos1: S, Pos2: H? Then R is at pos3? No: S-H-O-R-T → so R is at position 4? Then that's not second. We must have R at position 2.

So example words: 
- BRISK: B R I S K → but we don't know if B is okay? Because we haven't tested B.
- GRIPE, but E is bad.

We need to avoid E, so not GRIPE.

Let me think of words: 
- PROUD (P R O U D) 
- BROIL (B R O I L)
- FRUIT (F R U I T) → U and I, F, T → F is not so common, but T is.
- TRYST? That might not be common words.

Another one: ""GROUT"" (G R O U T) → G is new.

But S is very common, so probably better to test S and also T.

Optimal: ""FROST"" → F R O S T → This tests F, O, S, T. If any of these are in the word, we get feedback.

Also, we know the word does not have A, E, so we avoid vowels A,E but must have another vowel: probably O, U, I.

I think ""FROST"" is a good candidate because:
- F: we don't know
- R: is correct and in position
- O: vowel we haven't tested
- S: very common consonant
- T: very common consonant

If none of these hit, we get information about missing F, O, S, T.

Alternatively, ""PRISM"": P R I S M → tests P, I, S, M → I is a vowel, and S is common.

But ""FROST"" covers more common letters? Let me see frequency.

In English, the frequency order: E (already excluded), T, A (excluded), O, I, N (excluded), S, etc. So T and O and S are very common.

Therefore, ""FROST"" might be better.

Another common starting word is ""ROAST"", but we cannot because A is excluded. So ""ROAST"" has A which is not allowed.

Similarly, ""CRATE"" has C, A, E all excluded.

So I will go with ""FROST"".

But wait: we are sure that the word does not have A, E, C, N. So let's choose FROST.

Guess: FROST

And we'll see the feedback.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- R is confirmed in the **second position**.
- C, A, N, and E are **not** in the word.

For the second guess:
- Must include R in the second position.
- Exclude C, A, N, E.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, I) to maximize information.
- ""FROST"" fits well: 
  - F, O, S, T are new letters.
  - Tests the vowel O and common consonants (S, T).
  - Avoids repeating C, A, N, E.

But note: we haven't tested letters like T, S, L, etc. 

Another idea: We know the word must have an R in the middle. Common words: 

Let's list some words fitting _ R _ _ _ and not containing C, A, N, E.

Options:
- ""BRUSH"": B, R, U, S, H → U and S are new, also H.
- ""FROST"": F, R, O, S, T → O, S, T are new → but S and T are very common.
- ""GRIPE"": G, R, I, P, E → oh, E is not allowed because we know E is not in the word. So avoid E.
- ""PRISM"": P, R, I, S, M → I and S are new.

We must avoid A, C, N, E.

So let's choose a word that covers as many new letters as possible.

Considering frequency: S, T, L, O, I are common.

We can try ""PROUD"":
- P, R, O, U, D → tests O, U, P, D.

But S and T are still untested.

Alternatively, ""TRIPS"": T, R, I, P, S → tests T, I, P, S → but P and S? Not sure.

Another good one: ""FROST"" → F, R, O, S, T → tests F, O, S, T → F is less common, but O, S, T are common.

Or ""SHORT"": S, H, O, R, T → no, because R must be second? Here R is fourth? Not correct pattern.

We need the R in the second position: so word is [letter] R [three letters].

So ""SHORT"" is S H O R T → positions: 1:S, 2:H (not R) → wrong, because R must be second? In the feedback, R was at position 2 in CRANE and it was correct, so in the secret word second letter is R, so pattern: ? R ? ? ?

Therefore, ""SHORT"" doesn't fit because R is at position 4? Actually in ""SHORT"": positions are:
Pos1: S, Pos2: H? Then R is at pos3? No: S-H-O-R-T → so R is at position 4? Then that's not second. We must have R at position 2.

So example words: 
- BRISK: B R I S K → but we don't know if B is okay? Because we haven't tested B.
- GRIPE, but E is bad.

We need to avoid E, so not GRIPE.

Let me think of words: 
- PROUD (P R O U D) 
- BROIL (B R O I L)
- FRUIT (F R U I T) → U and I, F, T → F is not so common, but T is.
- TRYST? That might not be common words.

Another one: ""GROUT"" (G R O U T) → G is new.

But S is very common, so probably better to test S and also T.

Optimal: ""FROST"" → F R O S T → This tests F, O, S, T. If any of these are in the word, we get feedback.

Also, we know the word does not have A, E, so we avoid vowels A,E but must have another vowel: probably O, U, I.

I think ""FROST"" is a good candidate because:
- F: we don't know
- R: is correct and in position
- O: vowel we haven't tested
- S: very common consonant
- T: very common consonant

If none of these hit, we get information about missing F, O, S, T.

Alternatively, ""PRISM"": P R I S M → tests P, I, S, M → I is a vowel, and S is common.

But ""FROST"" covers more common letters? Let me see frequency.

In English, the frequency order: E (already excluded), T, A (excluded), O, I, N (excluded), S, etc. So T and O and S are very common.

Therefore, ""FROST"" might be better.

Another common starting word is ""ROAST"", but we cannot because A is excluded. So ""ROAST"" has A which is not allowed.

Similarly, ""CRATE"" has C, A, E all excluded.

So I will go with ""FROST"".

But wait: we are sure that the word does not have A, E, C, N. So let's choose FROST.

Guess: FROST

And we'll see the feedback.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- R is confirmed in the **second position**.
- C, A, N, and E are **not** in the word.

For the second guess:
- Must include R in the second position.
- Exclude C, A, N, E.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, I) to maximize information.
- ""FROST"" fits well: 
  - F, O, S, T are new letters.
  - Tests the vowel O and common consonants (S, T).
  - Avoids repeating C, A, N, E.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: not in word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → so the second letter is R
- A: not in word (x)
- N: not in word (x)
- E: not in word (x)

Guess 2: FROST
- F: not in word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → confirmed again, second letter is R
- O: not in word (x)
- S: not in word (x)
- T: not in word (x)

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, F, O, S, T.

We have eliminated 8 letters: A, C, E, F, N, O, S, T.

The word must have an R in the second position and does not contain any of the eliminated letters.

We need to think of a word that fits the pattern: _ R _ _ _

Available letters: We have to use letters that are not eliminated. The English alphabet minus the eliminated ones.

Eliminated: A, C, E, F, N, O, S, T.

Remaining letters: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also need to form a valid English word.

We know that the word must have a vowel (since every English word has at least one vowel). The vowels are A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y). We have eliminated A, E, O. So the remaining vowels are I, U, and Y (if considered a vowel).

Therefore, the word must contain at least one of I, U, or Y.

Now, we need to make a guess that includes some of these vowels and other consonants from the remaining set.

Common letters from the remaining: L, M, P, U, D, G, B, etc.

Possible words with R in the second position and using only the available letters:

Pattern: _ R _ _ _

Let's try to think of words:

- BRICK? But C is eliminated, so no.
- BRING? N is eliminated, no.
- BRISK? S is eliminated, no.
- BRUTE? B R U T E → T and E are eliminated? T is eliminated, E is eliminated. So no.

We need to avoid T and E.

What about: 
- BRUIN? B R U I N → N is eliminated, so no.
- BUILD? B U I L D → but R is not in second position? We need R in second.

We must have R in the second position.

So: 
- DRUID? D R U I D → D, R, U, I, D. D is available, U and I are vowels. But D is repeated? That's okay, but let's see if it's valid. ""DRUID"" is a valid word. But we haven't tested D, U, I, and we know R is in place.

But we have to check if D is available? Yes, D is not eliminated.

Another one: 
- GRIMY? G R I M Y → G, R, I, M, Y. All available? G, I, M, Y are available. Y can be a vowel. So ""GRIMY"" is a word.

Another: 
- PRIVY? P R I V Y → P, R, I, V, Y. All available? P, I, V, Y are available. V is available.

But we don't know if these letters are in the word.

We need to test as many new letters as possible.

Another common word: 
- BRIDE? B R I D E → but E is eliminated, so no.
- PRIME? P R I M E → E is eliminated, no.

So without E, it's a bit tricky.

What about: 
- GRUMP? G R U M P → G, R, U, M, P. All available. ""GRUMP"" is a word.

Or: 
- DRUMP? Not a word.

Another: 
- CRIMP? C is eliminated, no.

Let's list possible words:

- Using U: 
  - DRUMS? D R U M S → but S is eliminated. No.
  - TRUCK? T and C eliminated, no.
  - BRUSH? S and H? H is available, but S is eliminated. No.

- Using I:
  - PRISM? P R I S M → S eliminated, no.
  - BRINK? N and K? N eliminated, K available, but N is out. No.
  - BRISK? S eliminated, no.

- Using Y:
  - CRYPT? C eliminated, no.
  - WRYLY? W R Y L Y → W, R, Y, L, Y. But Y repeated? And ""WRYLY"" is a word? Yes, but we have to check letters: W, L, Y are available. R is in place. So ""WRYLY"" is a candidate.

But ""WRYLY"" has two Y's, which might not be efficient for information.

Another: 
- GRILL? G R I L L → G, R, I, L, L. L repeated. ""GRILL"" is a word. Letters: G, I, L available.

But we are testing only three new letters: G, I, L.

Similarly, ""DRILY"": D R I L Y → D, R, I, L, Y. All available. ""DRILY"" is a word.

""DRILY"" tests D, I, L, Y.

Another: ""PRICY""? P R I C Y → C is eliminated, no.

""BUILT""? B U I L T → T eliminated, and R not in second? No.

We must have R in second.

So let's consider:

- ""GRUEL""? G R U E L → E eliminated, no.

- ""GRUBB""? Not a word.

- ""PLUMB""? P L U M B → no R in second.

I think ""DRILY"" is a good candidate: D R I L Y

It tests D, I, L, Y, all new letters.

""GRIMY"": G R I M Y

Tests G, I, M, Y.

""PRIMY""? Not common, but ""PRIMY"" is a word? I think ""PRIMY"" is archaic, but we can use ""PRIME"" which has E. Not available.

Another: ""BRINY""? B R I N Y → N eliminated, no.

""DRYLY"": D R Y L Y → similar to WRYLY, but with D and L. ""DRYLY"" is a word.

But again, repeated Y.

To maximize information, we should avoid repeating letters if possible.

So ""DRILY"" has no repeats: D, R, I, L, Y.

Similarly, ""GRIMY"" has no repeats: G, R, I, M, Y.

""PRIVY"": P R I V Y → no repeats.

Now, which one to choose? We need to consider letter frequency among the remaining letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need vowels: I, U, Y.

I is more common than U and Y in 5-letter words.

Also, common consonants: L, M, P, D, G, etc.

""PRIVY"" includes P, R, I, V, Y. V is less common, so maybe not the best.

""GRIMY"" includes G, R, I, M, Y. G and M are medium frequency.

""DRILY"" includes D, R, I, L, Y. D and L are common.

L is very common, so testing L might be good.

Another word: ""BUILD"" but R not in second.

""GUILD"" G U I L D → but R not in second.

We must have R in second.

What about ""QUIRK""? Q U I R K → R is in fourth position? Not second. Pattern must be ? R ? ? ?

""QUIRK"" is Q U I R K → positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:R, 5:K → so R is fourth, not second. So no.

""WRING""? W R I N G → N eliminated, no.

""BRING"" same.

""CRIMP"" C eliminated.

I think ""DRILY"" or ""GRIMY"" are reasonable.

But let's also consider U words.

For example: ""GRUFF""? G R U F F → F eliminated, and repeated F? No.

""DRUMS"" S eliminated.

""TRUMP"" T eliminated.

""CRUDE"" C and E eliminated.

So U might be harder to fit without using eliminated letters.

Therefore, I think focusing on I and Y is better.

Another word: ""PRIDE"" E eliminated.

""PRIED"" same.

""PLIED"" P L I E D → E eliminated.

""GLIDE"" G L I D E → E eliminated.

Without E, we have to use U or Y.

""BLUFF"" F eliminated.

""JUMPY"" J U M P Y → J is less common, but possible. ""JUMPY"" has R? No, pattern must have R in second. ""JUMPY"" is J U M P Y, no R.

We need R in second.

""JUMPS"" S eliminated.

I think we have to go with one of the words we have.

Let me choose ""DRILY"" because it has L which is a very common letter.

""DRILY"": D R I L Y

This tests D, I, L, Y.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Another option: ""GRUB"" is 4 letters, not 5.

""GRUBS"" S eliminated.

So I think ""DRILY"" is a good choice.

But let's confirm: D is available, R is in position, I available, L available, Y available.

Yes.

We could do ""PRIVY"" but V is less common.

Or ""WRYLY"" but repeated Y.

I'll go with ""DRILY"".

But we have to make sure it's a valid word. ""Drily"" is an adverb meaning in a dry manner, but it's accepted as a word.

Similarly, ""grimy"" is common.

To have more common letters, what about ""BUILT""? But T eliminated and no R in second.

Another: ""GUILT"" G U I L T → T eliminated.

""QUILT"" same.

""BUOY"" not 5 letters.

I think we have to use one of these.

Perhaps ""BRICK"" but C eliminated.

So, I choose ""DRILY"".

But let's see if there's a word with U.

""DRUGS"" S eliminated.

""DRUID"" D R U I D → that's 5 letters. ""DRUID"" is a word. It has U and I, both vowels. And D is tested twice? But D is the same letter, so it might not give more information.

In ""DRUID"", we have D, R, U, I, D. So we are testing D, U, I, but D is repeated. So we get less information about other letters.

Whereas ""DRILY"" has unique letters: D, R, I, L, Y.

Similarly, ""GRIMY"" has G, R, I, M, Y.

I think ""DRILY"" is better because L is more common than M.

Letter frequency: L is more common than M in English.

So ""DRILY"" tests D, I, L, Y.

We can also consider ""PRIZE"" but Z and E? E eliminated, and Z is rare.

""PRICE"" C and E eliminated.

So, I think ""DRILY"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, the next guess is ""DRILY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: Eliminated letters C, A, N, E. Confirmed R in the second position.
- **Guess 2 (FROST)**: Eliminated letters F, O, S, T. Confirmed R again in the second position.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has **R in the second position**.
- **Eliminated letters (not in the word)**: A, C, E, F, N, O, S, T.
- **Remaining possible letters**: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- The word must contain at least one vowel (I, U, or Y, since A, E, O are eliminated).
- Goal for this guess: Test new high-frequency letters from the remaining set (e.g., L, I, D, Y) to gather more information while keeping R in position 2.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Pattern**: The word must follow `_ R _ _ _`.
- **Prioritize**: 
  - Testing vowels I or U (Y can also act as a vowel).
  - Including common consonants like L, D, or M.
  - Avoiding eliminated letters and minimizing letter repetition.
- **Selected word: ""DRILY""** (meaning ""in a dry or sarcastic manner"").
  - **Why ""DRILY""?**
    - Fits the pattern: `D R I L Y`.
    - Tests new vowels: I and Y.
    - Tests common consonants: D and L (L is highly frequent in English).
    - All letters are unique and from the remaining set.
    - If this guess fails, feedback on D, I, L, Y will significantly narrow possibilities (e.g., words like ""GRIMY"", ""PRIVY"", or ""DRUID"" could be next).

<guess>DRILY</guess>",DRILY,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: not in word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → so the second letter is R
- A: not in word (x)
- N: not in word (x)
- E: not in word (x)

Guess 2: FROST
- F: not in word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → confirmed again, second letter is R
- O: not in word (x)
- S: not in word (x)
- T: not in word (x)

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, F, O, S, T.

We have eliminated 8 letters: A, C, E, F, N, O, S, T.

The word must have an R in the second position and does not contain any of the eliminated letters.

We need to think of a word that fits the pattern: _ R _ _ _

Available letters: We have to use letters that are not eliminated. The English alphabet minus the eliminated ones.

Eliminated: A, C, E, F, N, O, S, T.

Remaining letters: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also need to form a valid English word.

We know that the word must have a vowel (since every English word has at least one vowel). The vowels are A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y). We have eliminated A, E, O. So the remaining vowels are I, U, and Y (if considered a vowel).

Therefore, the word must contain at least one of I, U, or Y.

Now, we need to make a guess that includes some of these vowels and other consonants from the remaining set.

Common letters from the remaining: L, M, P, U, D, G, B, etc.

Possible words with R in the second position and using only the available letters:

Pattern: _ R _ _ _

Let's try to think of words:

- BRICK? But C is eliminated, so no.
- BRING? N is eliminated, no.
- BRISK? S is eliminated, no.
- BRUTE? B R U T E → T and E are eliminated? T is eliminated, E is eliminated. So no.

We need to avoid T and E.

- BRUIN? B R U I N → N is eliminated, so no.
- BUILD? B U I L D → but R is not in second position? We need R in second.

We must have R in the second position.

So: 
- DRUID? D R U I D → D, R, U, I, D. D is available, U and I are vowels. But D is repeated? That's okay, but let's see if it's valid. ""DRUID"" is a valid word. But we haven't tested D, U, I, and we know R is in place.

But we have to check if D is available? Yes, D is not eliminated.

Another one: 
- GRIMY? G R I M Y → G, R, I, M, Y. All available? G, I, M, Y are available. Y can be a vowel. So ""GRIMY"" is a word.

Another: 
- PRIVY? P R I V Y → P, R, I, V, Y. All available? P, I, V, Y are available. V is available.

But we don't know if these letters are in the word.

We need to test as many new letters as possible.

Another common word: 
- BRIDE? B R I D E → but E is eliminated, so no.
- PRIME? P R I M E → E is eliminated, no.

So without E, it's a bit tricky.

What about: 
- GRUMP? G R U M P → G, R, U, M, P. All available. ""GRUMP"" is a word.

Or: 
- DRUMP? Not a word.

Another: 
- CRIMP? C is eliminated, no.

Let's list possible words:

- Using U: 
  - DRUMS? D R U M S → but S is eliminated. No.
  - TRUCK? T and C eliminated, no.
  - BRUSH? S and H? H is available, but S is eliminated. No.

- Using I:
  - PRISM? P R I S M → S eliminated, no.
  - BRINK? N and K? N eliminated, K available, but N is out. No.
  - BRISK? S eliminated, no.

- Using Y:
  - CRYPT? C eliminated, no.
  - WRYLY? W R Y L Y → W, R, Y, L, Y. But Y repeated? And ""WRYLY"" is a word? Yes, but we have to check letters: W, L, Y are available. R is in place. So ""WRYLY"" is a candidate.

But ""WRYLY"" has two Y's, which might not be efficient for information.

Another: 
- GRILL? G R I L L → G, R, I, L, L. L repeated. ""GRILL"" is a word. Letters: G, I, L available.

But we are testing only three new letters: G, I, L.

Similarly, ""DRILY"": D R I L Y → D, R, I, L, Y. All available. ""DRILY"" is a word.

""DRILY"" tests D, I, L, Y.

Another: ""PRICY""? P R I C Y → C is eliminated, no.

""BUILT""? B U I L T → T eliminated, and R not in second? No.

We must have R in second.

So let's consider:

- ""GRUEL""? G R U E L → E eliminated, no.

- ""GRUBB""? Not a word.

- ""PLUMB""? P L U M B → no R in second.

I think ""DRILY"" is a good candidate: D R I L Y

It tests D, I, L, Y, all new letters.

""GRIMY"": G R I M Y

Tests G, I, M, Y.

""PRIMY""? Not common, but ""PRIMY"" is a word? I think ""PRIMY"" is archaic, but we can use ""PRIME"" which has E. Not available.

Another: ""BRINY""? B R I N Y → N eliminated, no.

""DRYLY"": D R Y L Y → similar to WRYLY, but with D and L. ""DRYLY"" is a word.

But again, repeated Y.

To maximize information, we should avoid repeating letters if possible.

So ""DRILY"" has no repeats: D, R, I, L, Y.

Similarly, ""GRIMY"" has no repeats: G, R, I, M, Y.

""PRIVY"": P R I V Y → no repeats.

Now, which one to choose? We need to consider letter frequency among the remaining letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need vowels: I, U, Y.

I is more common than U and Y in 5-letter words.

Also, common consonants: L, M, P, D, G, etc.

""PRIVY"" includes P, R, I, V, Y. V is less common, so maybe not the best.

""GRIMY"" includes G, R, I, M, Y. G and M are medium frequency.

""DRILY"" includes D, R, I, L, Y. D and L are common.

L is very common, so testing L might be good.

Another word: ""BUILD"" but R not in second.

""GUILD"" G U I L D → but R not in second.

We must have R in second.

What about ""QUIRK""? Q U I R K → R is in fourth position? Not second. Pattern must be ? R ? ? ?

""QUIRK"" is Q U I R K → positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:R, 5:K → so R is fourth, not second. So no.

""WRING""? W R I N G → N eliminated, no.

""BRING"" same.

""CRIMP"" C eliminated.

I think ""DRILY"" or ""GRIMY"" are reasonable.

But let's also consider U words.

For example: ""GRUFF""? G R U F F → F eliminated, and repeated F? No.

""DRUMS"" S eliminated.

""TRUMP"" T eliminated.

""CRUDE"" C and E eliminated.

So U might be harder to fit without using eliminated letters.

Therefore, I think focusing on I and Y is better.

Another word: ""PRIDE"" E eliminated.

""PRIED"" same.

""PLIED"" P L I E D → E eliminated.

""GLIDE"" G L I D E → E eliminated.

Without E, we have to use U or Y.

""BLUFF"" F eliminated.

""JUMPY"" J U M P Y → J is less common, but possible. ""JUMPY"" has R? No, pattern must have R in second. ""JUMPY"" is J U M P Y, no R.

We need R in second.

""JUMPS"" S eliminated.

I think we have to go with one of the words we have.

Let me choose ""DRILY"" because it has L which is a very common letter.

""DRILY"": D R I L Y

This tests D, I, L, Y.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Another option: ""GRUB"" is 4 letters, not 5.

""GRUBS"" S eliminated.

So I think ""DRILY"" is a good choice.

But let's confirm: D is available, R is in position, I available, L available, Y available.

Yes.

We could do ""PRIVY"" but V is less common.

Or ""WRYLY"" but repeated Y.

I'll go with ""DRILY"".

But we have to make sure it's a valid word. ""Drily"" is an adverb meaning in a dry manner, but it's accepted as a word.

Similarly, ""grimy"" is common.

To have more common letters, what about ""BUILT""? But T eliminated and no R in second.

Another: ""GUILT"" G U I L T → T eliminated.

""QUILT"" same.

""BUOY"" not 5 letters.

I think we have to use one of these.

Perhaps ""BRICK"" but C eliminated.

So, I choose ""DRILY"".

But let's see if there's a word with U.

""DRUGS"" S eliminated.

""DRUID"" D R U I D → that's 5 letters. ""DRUID"" is a word. It has U and I, both vowels. And D is tested twice? But D is the same letter, so it might not give more information.

In ""DRUID"", we have D, R, U, I, D. So we are testing D, U, I, but D is repeated. So we get less information about other letters.

Whereas ""DRILY"" has unique letters: D, R, I, L, Y.

Similarly, ""GRIMY"" has G, R, I, M, Y.

I think ""DRILY"" is better because L is more common than M.

Letter frequency: L is more common than M in English.

So ""DRILY"" tests D, I, L, Y.

We can also consider ""PRIZE"" but Z and E? E eliminated, and Z is rare.

""PRICE"" C and E eliminated.

So, I think ""DRILY"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, the next guess is ""DRILY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: Eliminated letters C, A, N, E. Confirmed R in the second position.
- **Guess 2 (FROST)**: Eliminated letters F, O, S, T. Confirmed R again in the second position.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has **R in the second position**.
- **Eliminated letters (not in the word)**: A, C, E, F, N, O, S, T.
- **Remaining possible letters**: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- The word must contain at least one vowel (I, U, or Y, since A, E, O are eliminated).
- Goal for this guess: Test new high-frequency letters from the remaining set (e.g., L, I, D, Y) to gather more information while keeping R in position 2.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Pattern**: The word must follow `_ R _ _ _`.
- **Prioritize**: 
  - Testing vowels I or U (Y can also act as a vowel).
  - Including common consonants like L, D, or M.
  - Avoiding eliminated letters and minimizing letter repetition.
- **Selected word: ""DRILY""** (meaning ""in a dry or sarcastic manner"").
  - **Why ""DRILY""?**
    - Fits the pattern: `D R I L Y`.
    - Tests new vowels: I and Y.
    - Tests common consonants: D and L (L is highly frequent in English).
    - All letters are unique and from the remaining set.
    - If this guess fails, feedback on D, I, L, Y will significantly narrow possibilities (e.g., words like ""GRIMY"", ""PRIVY"", or ""DRUID"" could be next).",Guess 3: DRILY -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(✓) I(x) L(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no feedback yet. We need to make an initial guess.
 A common strategy is to choose a word that includes several common letters to gather information.
 For the first guess, it's often good to pick a word with unique letters and including vowels and common consonants.
 I recall that words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", ""STARE"" are good starting words because they have common letters.
 But note: we need a 5-letter word. Let me choose ""RAISE"" because it has two vowels (A, I) and common consonants (R, S).
 However, another popular starting word is ""CRANE"". Let me consider that.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 Important: We are making the first guess. So we have no prior feedback.

 Our goal is to maximize information. 

 I decide to go with ""CRANE"".

 So the guess is: CRANE

 But note: We are to return the word in the format: <guess>CRANE</guess>Considering the first guess, a strategic approach is to maximize information about common letters. A word with diverse, frequently used letters can help identify letters in the secret word. 

Key criteria:
- Include common vowels (A, E) and consonants (R, S, T).
- Avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
- Prioritize words with high-frequency letters in English.

**Optimal starting words**: Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" fit these criteria. Among these, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because:
- It covers three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
- Letters like C, R, and N appear in many 5-letter words.
- It avoids rare letters (J, Q, Z), increasing the chance of feedback hits.

This guess will provide immediate feedback on vowels and consonants, helping to narrow down the secret word efficiently.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""CRANE"": 
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So we know:
- The secret word has an 'R' in the second position.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Since A and E are vowels and they are not in the word, we must consider other vowels: O, U, I, and sometimes Y. But we have to choose a word that excludes C, A, N, E and includes R in the second position.

Also, the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

We can use this information to make our second guess.

Important: We need to try a word that has new letters to test and confirms the R in the second position.

Strategy for second guess:
- Keep R in the second position.
- Avoid using C, A, N, E.
- Include other common letters to test, such as S, T, L, O, I, etc.

Possible words: 
We need words with the pattern: _ R _ _ _

Considering common letters, let's try to include vowels that haven't been tested: O, U, I.

For example:
- ""PROUD"" (P, R, O, U, D) --> Here we test O and U.
- ""BROIL"" (B, R, O, I, L) --> Tests O and I.
- ""TRUST"" (T, R, U, S, T) --> repeated T? Better avoid repetition for now.

But note: we haven't tested letters like T, S, L, etc. 

Another idea: We know the word must have an R in the middle. Common words: 

Let's list some words fitting _ R _ _ _ and not containing C, A, N, E.

Options:
- ""BRUSH"": B, R, U, S, H → U and S are new, also H.
- ""FROST"": F, R, O, S, T → O, S, T are new → but S and T are very common.
- ""GRIPE"": G, R, I, P, E → oh, E is not allowed because we know E is not in the word. So avoid E.
- ""PRISM"": P, R, I, S, M → I and S are new.

We must avoid A, C, N, E.

So let's choose a word that covers as many new letters as possible.

Considering frequency: S, T, L, O, I are common.

We can try ""PROUD"":
- P, R, O, U, D → tests O, U, P, D.

But S and T are still untested.

Alternatively, ""TRIPS"": T, R, I, P, S → tests T, I, P, S → but P and S? Not sure.

Another good one: ""FROST"" → F, R, O, S, T → tests F, O, S, T → F is less common, but O, S, T are common.

Or ""SHORT"": S, H, O, R, T → no, because R must be second? Here R is fourth? Not correct pattern.

We need the R in the second position: so word is [letter] R [three letters].

So ""SHORT"" is S H O R T → positions: 1:S, 2:H (not R) → wrong, because R must be second? In the feedback, R was at position 2 in CRANE and it was correct, so in the secret word second letter is R, so pattern: ? R ? ? ?

Therefore, ""SHORT"" doesn't fit because R is at position 4? Actually in ""SHORT"": positions are:
Pos1: S, Pos2: H? Then R is at pos3? No: S-H-O-R-T → so R is at position 4? Then that's not second. We must have R at position 2.

So example words: 
- BRISK: B R I S K → but we don't know if B is okay? Because we haven't tested B.
- GRIPE, but E is bad.

We need to avoid E, so not GRIPE.

Let me think of words: 
- PROUD (P R O U D) 
- BROIL (B R O I L)
- FRUIT (F R U I T) → U and I, F, T → F is not so common, but T is.
- TRYST? That might not be common words.

Another one: ""GROUT"" (G R O U T) → G is new.

But S is very common, so probably better to test S and also T.

Optimal: ""FROST"" → F R O S T → This tests F, O, S, T. If any of these are in the word, we get feedback.

Also, we know the word does not have A, E, so we avoid vowels A,E but must have another vowel: probably O, U, I.

I think ""FROST"" is a good candidate because:
- F: we don't know
- R: is correct and in position
- O: vowel we haven't tested
- S: very common consonant
- T: very common consonant

If none of these hit, we get information about missing F, O, S, T.

Alternatively, ""PRISM"": P R I S M → tests P, I, S, M → I is a vowel, and S is common.

But ""FROST"" covers more common letters? Let me see frequency.

In English, the frequency order: E (already excluded), T, A (excluded), O, I, N (excluded), S, etc. So T and O and S are very common.

Therefore, ""FROST"" might be better.

Another common starting word is ""ROAST"", but we cannot because A is excluded. So ""ROAST"" has A which is not allowed.

Similarly, ""CRATE"" has C, A, E all excluded.

So I will go with ""FROST"".

But wait: we are sure that the word does not have A, E, C, N. So let's choose FROST.

Guess: FROST

And we'll see the feedback.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- R is confirmed in the **second position**.
- C, A, N, and E are **not** in the word.

For the second guess:
- Must include R in the second position.
- Exclude C, A, N, E.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, I) to maximize information.
- ""FROST"" fits well: 
  - F, O, S, T are new letters.
  - Tests the vowel O and common consonants (S, T).
  - Avoids repeating C, A, N, E.

<guess>FROST</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: FROST -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: not in word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → so the second letter is R
- A: not in word (x)
- N: not in word (x)
- E: not in word (x)

Guess 2: FROST
- F: not in word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → confirmed again, second letter is R
- O: not in word (x)
- S: not in word (x)
- T: not in word (x)

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, F, O, S, T.

We have eliminated 8 letters: A, C, E, F, N, O, S, T.

The word must have an R in the second position and does not contain any of the eliminated letters.

We need to think of a word that fits the pattern: _ R _ _ _

Available letters: We have to use letters that are not eliminated. The English alphabet minus the eliminated ones.

Eliminated: A, C, E, F, N, O, S, T.

Remaining letters: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also need to form a valid English word.

We know that the word must have a vowel (since every English word has at least one vowel). The vowels are A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y). We have eliminated A, E, O. So the remaining vowels are I, U, and Y (if considered a vowel).

Therefore, the word must contain at least one of I, U, or Y.

Now, we need to make a guess that includes some of these vowels and other consonants from the remaining set.

Common letters from the remaining: L, M, P, U, D, G, B, etc.

Possible words with R in the second position and using only the available letters:

Pattern: _ R _ _ _

Let's try to think of words:

- BRICK? But C is eliminated, so no.
- BRING? N is eliminated, no.
- BRISK? S is eliminated, no.
- BRUTE? B R U T E → T and E are eliminated? T is eliminated, E is eliminated. So no.

We need to avoid T and E.

What about: 
- BRUIN? B R U I N → N is eliminated, so no.
- BUILD? B U I L D → but R is not in second position? We need R in second.

We must have R in the second position.

So: 
- DRUID? D R U I D → D, R, U, I, D. D is available, U and I are vowels. But D is repeated? That's okay, but let's see if it's valid. ""DRUID"" is a valid word. But we haven't tested D, U, I, and we know R is in place.

But we have to check if D is available? Yes, D is not eliminated.

Another one: 
- GRIMY? G R I M Y → G, R, I, M, Y. All available? G, I, M, Y are available. Y can be a vowel. So ""GRIMY"" is a word.

Another: 
- PRIVY? P R I V Y → P, R, I, V, Y. All available? P, I, V, Y are available. V is available.

But we don't know if these letters are in the word.

We need to test as many new letters as possible.

Another common word: 
- BRIDE? B R I D E → but E is eliminated, so no.
- PRIME? P R I M E → E is eliminated, no.

So without E, it's a bit tricky.

What about: 
- GRUMP? G R U M P → G, R, U, M, P. All available. ""GRUMP"" is a word.

Or: 
- DRUMP? Not a word.

Another: 
- CRIMP? C is eliminated, no.

Let's list possible words:

- Using U: 
  - DRUMS? D R U M S → but S is eliminated. No.
  - TRUCK? T and C eliminated, no.
  - BRUSH? S and H? H is available, but S is eliminated. No.

- Using I:
  - PRISM? P R I S M → S eliminated, no.
  - BRINK? N and K? N eliminated, K available, but N is out. No.
  - BRISK? S eliminated, no.

- Using Y:
  - CRYPT? C eliminated, no.
  - WRYLY? W R Y L Y → W, R, Y, L, Y. But Y repeated? And ""WRYLY"" is a word? Yes, but we have to check letters: W, L, Y are available. R is in place. So ""WRYLY"" is a candidate.

But ""WRYLY"" has two Y's, which might not be efficient for information.

Another: 
- GRILL? G R I L L → G, R, I, L, L. L repeated. ""GRILL"" is a word. Letters: G, I, L available.

But we are testing only three new letters: G, I, L.

Similarly, ""DRILY"": D R I L Y → D, R, I, L, Y. All available. ""DRILY"" is a word.

""DRILY"" tests D, I, L, Y.

Another: ""PRICY""? P R I C Y → C is eliminated, no.

""BUILT""? B U I L T → T eliminated, and R not in second? No.

We must have R in second.

So let's consider:

- ""GRUEL""? G R U E L → E eliminated, no.

- ""GRUBB""? Not a word.

- ""PLUMB""? P L U M B → no R in second.

I think ""DRILY"" is a good candidate: D R I L Y

It tests D, I, L, Y, all new letters.

""GRIMY"": G R I M Y

Tests G, I, M, Y.

""PRIMY""? Not common, but ""PRIMY"" is a word? I think ""PRIMY"" is archaic, but we can use ""PRIME"" which has E. Not available.

Another: ""BRINY""? B R I N Y → N eliminated, no.

""DRYLY"": D R Y L Y → similar to WRYLY, but with D and L. ""DRYLY"" is a word.

But again, repeated Y.

To maximize information, we should avoid repeating letters if possible.

So ""DRILY"" has no repeats: D, R, I, L, Y.

Similarly, ""GRIMY"" has no repeats: G, R, I, M, Y.

""PRIVY"": P R I V Y → no repeats.

Now, which one to choose? We need to consider letter frequency among the remaining letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need vowels: I, U, Y.

I is more common than U and Y in 5-letter words.

Also, common consonants: L, M, P, D, G, etc.

""PRIVY"" includes P, R, I, V, Y. V is less common, so maybe not the best.

""GRIMY"" includes G, R, I, M, Y. G and M are medium frequency.

""DRILY"" includes D, R, I, L, Y. D and L are common.

L is very common, so testing L might be good.

Another word: ""BUILD"" but R not in second.

""GUILD"" G U I L D → but R not in second.

We must have R in second.

What about ""QUIRK""? Q U I R K → R is in fourth position? Not second. Pattern must be ? R ? ? ?

""QUIRK"" is Q U I R K → positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:R, 5:K → so R is fourth, not second. So no.

""WRING""? W R I N G → N eliminated, no.

""BRING"" same.

""CRIMP"" C eliminated.

I think ""DRILY"" or ""GRIMY"" are reasonable.

But let's also consider U words.

For example: ""GRUFF""? G R U F F → F eliminated, and repeated F? No.

""DRUMS"" S eliminated.

""TRUMP"" T eliminated.

""CRUDE"" C and E eliminated.

So U might be harder to fit without using eliminated letters.

Therefore, I think focusing on I and Y is better.

Another word: ""PRIDE"" E eliminated.

""PRIED"" same.

""PLIED"" P L I E D → E eliminated.

""GLIDE"" G L I D E → E eliminated.

Without E, we have to use U or Y.

""BLUFF"" F eliminated.

""JUMPY"" J U M P Y → J is less common, but possible. ""JUMPY"" has R? No, pattern must have R in second. ""JUMPY"" is J U M P Y, no R.

We need R in second.

""JUMPS"" S eliminated.

I think we have to go with one of the words we have.

Let me choose ""DRILY"" because it has L which is a very common letter.

""DRILY"": D R I L Y

This tests D, I, L, Y.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Another option: ""GRUB"" is 4 letters, not 5.

""GRUBS"" S eliminated.

So I think ""DRILY"" is a good choice.

But let's confirm: D is available, R is in position, I available, L available, Y available.

Yes.

We could do ""PRIVY"" but V is less common.

Or ""WRYLY"" but repeated Y.

I'll go with ""DRILY"".

But we have to make sure it's a valid word. ""Drily"" is an adverb meaning in a dry manner, but it's accepted as a word.

Similarly, ""grimy"" is common.

To have more common letters, what about ""BUILT""? But T eliminated and no R in second.

Another: ""GUILT"" G U I L T → T eliminated.

""QUILT"" same.

""BUOY"" not 5 letters.

I think we have to use one of these.

Perhaps ""BRICK"" but C eliminated.

So, I choose ""DRILY"".

But let's see if there's a word with U.

""DRUGS"" S eliminated.

""DRUID"" D R U I D → that's 5 letters. ""DRUID"" is a word. It has U and I, both vowels. And D is tested twice? But D is the same letter, so it might not give more information.

In ""DRUID"", we have D, R, U, I, D. So we are testing D, U, I, but D is repeated. So we get less information about other letters.

Whereas ""DRILY"" has unique letters: D, R, I, L, Y.

Similarly, ""GRIMY"" has G, R, I, M, Y.

I think ""DRILY"" is better because L is more common than M.

Letter frequency: L is more common than M in English.

So ""DRILY"" tests D, I, L, Y.

We can also consider ""PRIZE"" but Z and E? E eliminated, and Z is rare.

""PRICE"" C and E eliminated.

So, I think ""DRILY"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, the next guess is ""DRILY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: Eliminated letters C, A, N, E. Confirmed R in the second position.
- **Guess 2 (FROST)**: Eliminated letters F, O, S, T. Confirmed R again in the second position.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has **R in the second position**.
- **Eliminated letters (not in the word)**: A, C, E, F, N, O, S, T.
- **Remaining possible letters**: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- The word must contain at least one vowel (I, U, or Y, since A, E, O are eliminated).
- Goal for this guess: Test new high-frequency letters from the remaining set (e.g., L, I, D, Y) to gather more information while keeping R in position 2.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Pattern**: The word must follow `_ R _ _ _`.
- **Prioritize**: 
  - Testing vowels I or U (Y can also act as a vowel).
  - Including common consonants like L, D, or M.
  - Avoiding eliminated letters and minimizing letter repetition.
- **Selected word: ""DRILY""** (meaning ""in a dry or sarcastic manner"").
  - **Why ""DRILY""?**
    - Fits the pattern: `D R I L Y`.
    - Tests new vowels: I and Y.
    - Tests common consonants: D and L (L is highly frequent in English).
    - All letters are unique and from the remaining set.
    - If this guess fails, feedback on D, I, L, Y will significantly narrow possibilities (e.g., words like ""GRIMY"", ""PRIVY"", or ""DRUID"" could be next).

We have no feedback yet. We need to make an initial guess.\n A common strategy is to choose a word that includes several common letters to gather information.\n For the first guess, it\'s often good to pick a word with unique letters and including vowels and common consonants.\n I recall that words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", ""STARE"" are good starting words because they have common letters.\n But note: we need a 5-letter word.

Among these, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because:\n- It covers three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).\n- Letters like C, R, and N appear in many 5-letter words.\n- It avoids rare letters (J, Q, Z), increasing the chance of feedback hits.\n\nThis guess will provide immediate feedback on vowels and consonants, helping to narrow down the secret word efficiently.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on the first guess ""CRANE"": \n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nSo we know:\n- The secret word has an \'R\' in the second position.\n- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.\n\nSince A and E are vowels and they are not in the word, we must consider other vowels: O, U, I, and sometimes Y. But we have to choose a word that excludes C, A, N, E and includes R in the second position.\n\nAlso, the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.\n\nWe can use this information to make our second guess.\n\nImportant: We need to try a word that has new letters to test and confirms the R in the second position.\n\nStrategy for second guess:\n- Keep R in the second position.\n- Avoid using C, A, N, E.\n- Include other common letters to test, such as S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n\nPossible words: \nWe need words with the pattern: _ R _ _ _\n\nConsidering common letters, let\'s try to include vowels that haven\'t been tested: O, U, I.\n\nFor example:\n- ""PROUD"" (P, R, O, U, D) --> Here we test O and U.\n- ""BROIL"" (B, R, O, I, L) --> Tests O and I.\n- ""TRUST"" (T, R, U, S, T) --> repeated T? Better avoid repetition for now.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested letters like T, S, L, etc. \n\nAnother idea: We know the word must have an R in the middle. Common words: \n\nLet\'s list some words fitting _ R _ _ _ and not containing C, A, N, E.\n\nOptions:\n- ""BRUSH"": B, R, U, S, H → U and S are new, also H.\n- ""FROST"": F, R, O, S, T → O, S, T are new → but S and T are very common.\n- ""GRIPE"": G, R, I, P, E → oh, E is not allowed because we know E is not in the word. So avoid E.\n- ""PRISM"": P, R, I, S, M → I and S are new.\n\nWe must avoid A, C, N, E.\n\nSo let\'s choose a word that covers as many new letters as possible.\n\nConsidering frequency: S, T, L, O, I are common.\n\nWe can try ""PROUD"":\n- P, R, O, U, D → tests O, U, P, D.\n\nBut S and T are still untested.\n\nAlternatively, ""TRIPS"": T, R, I, P, S → tests T, I, P, S → but P and S? Not sure.\n\nAnother good one: ""FROST"" → F, R, O, S, T → tests F, O, S, T → F is less common, but O, S, T are common.\n\nOr ""SHORT"": S, H, O, R, T → no, because R must be second? Here R is fourth? Not correct pattern.\n\nWe need the R in the second position: so word is [letter] R [three letters].\n\nSo ""SHORT"" is S H O R T → positions: 1:S, 2:H (not R) → wrong, because R must be second? In the feedback, R was at position 2 in CRANE and it was correct, so in the secret word second letter is R, so pattern: ? R ? ? ?\n\nTherefore, ""SHORT"" doesn\'t fit because R is at position 4? Actually in ""SHORT"": positions are:\nPos1: S, Pos2: H? Then R is at pos3? No: S-H-O-R-T → so R is at position 4? Then that\'s not second. We must have R at position 2.\n\nSo example words: \n- BRISK: B R I S K → but we don\'t know if B is okay? Because we haven\'t tested B.\n- GRIPE, but E is bad.\n\nWe need to avoid E, so not GRIPE.\n\nLet me think of words: \n- PROUD (P R O U D) \n- BROIL (B R O I L)\n- FRUIT (F R U I T) → U and I, F, T → F is not so common, but T is.\n- TRYST? That might not be common words.\n\nAnother one: ""GROUT"" (G R O U T) → G is new.\n\nBut S is very common, so probably better to test S and also T.\n\nOptimal: ""FROST"" → F R O S T → This tests F, O, S, T. If any of these are in the word, we get feedback.\n\nAlso, we know the word does not have A, E, so we avoid vowels A,E but must have another vowel: probably O, U, I.\n\nI think ""FROST"" is a good candidate because:\n- F: we don\'t know\n- R: is correct and in position\n- O: vowel we haven\'t tested\n- S: very common consonant\n- T: very common consonant\n\nIf none of these hit, we get information about missing F, O, S, T.\n\nAlternatively, ""PRISM"": P R I S M → tests P, I, S, M → I is a vowel, and S is common.\n\nBut ""FROST"" covers more common letters? Let me see frequency.\n\nIn English, the frequency order: E (already excluded), T, A (excluded), O, I, N (excluded), S, etc. So T and O and S are very common.\n\nTherefore, ""FROST"" might be better.\n\nAnother common starting word is ""ROAST"", but we cannot because A is excluded. So ""ROAST"" has A which is not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, ""CRATE"" has C, A, E all excluded.\n\nSo I will go with ""FROST"".\n\nBut wait: we are sure that the word does not have A, E, C, N. So let\'s choose FROST.\n\nGuess: FROST\n\nAnd we\'ll see the feedback.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- R is confirmed in the **second position**.\n- C, A, N, and E are **not** in the word.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include R in the second position.\n- Exclude C, A, N, E.\n- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, I) to maximize information.\n- ""FROST"" fits well: \n  - F, O, S, T are new letters.\n  - Tests the vowel O and common consonants (S, T).\n  - Avoids repeating C, A, N, E.\n\n<guess>FROST</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: FROST -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: not in word (x)\n- R: correct position (✓) → so the second letter is R\n- A: not in word (x)\n- N: not in word (x)\n- E: not in word (x)\n\nGuess 2: FROST\n- F: not in word (x)\n- R: correct position (✓) → confirmed again, second letter is R\n- O: not in word (x)\n- S: not in word (x)\n- T: not in word (x)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The second letter is R.\n- The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, F, O, S, T.\n\nWe have eliminated 8 letters: A, C, E, F, N, O, S, T.\n\nThe word must have an R in the second position and does not contain any of the eliminated letters.\n\nWe need to think of a word that fits the pattern: _ R _ _ _\n\nAvailable letters: We have to use letters that are not eliminated.

That\'s okay, but let\'s see if it\'s valid. ""DRUID"" is a valid word. But we haven\'t tested D, U, I, and we know R is in place.\n\nBut we have to check if D is available? Yes, D is not eliminated.\n\nAnother one: \n- GRIMY? G R I M Y → G, R, I, M, Y. All available? G, I, M, Y are available. Y can be a vowel. So ""GRIMY"" is a word.\n\nAnother: \n- PRIVY? P R I V Y → P, R, I, V, Y. All available? P, I, V, Y are available. V is available.\n\nBut we don\'t know if these letters are in the word.\n\nWe need to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother common word: \n- BRIDE? B R I D E → but E is eliminated, so no.\n- PRIME? P R I M E → E is eliminated, no.\n\nSo without E, it\'s a bit tricky.\n\nWhat about: \n- GRUMP? G R U M P → G, R, U, M, P. All available.

Yes, but we have to check letters: W, L, Y are available. R is in place.

V is less common, so maybe not the best.\n\n""GRIMY"" includes G, R, I, M, Y. G and M are medium frequency.\n\n""DRILY"" includes D, R, I, L, Y. D and L are common.\n\nL is very common, so testing L might be good.\n\nAnother word: ""BUILD"" but R not in second.\n\n""GUILD"" G U I L D → but R not in second.\n\nWe must have R in second.\n\nWhat about ""QUIRK""? Q U I R K → R is in fourth position? Not second. Pattern must be ? R ? ? ?\n\n""QUIRK"" is Q U I R K → positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:R, 5:K → so R is fourth, not second. So no.\n\n""WRING""? W R I N G → N eliminated, no.\n\n""BRING"" same.\n\n""CRIMP"" C eliminated.\n\nI think ""DRILY"" or ""GRIMY"" are reasonable.\n\nBut let\'s also consider U words.\n\nFor example: ""GRUFF""? G R U F F → F eliminated, and repeated F? No.\n\n""DRUMS"" S eliminated.\n\n""TRUMP"" T eliminated.\n\n""CRUDE"" C and E eliminated.\n\nSo U might be harder to fit without using eliminated letters.\n\nTherefore, I think focusing on I and Y is better.\n\nAnother word: ""PRIDE"" E eliminated.\n\n""PRIED"" same.\n\n""PLIED"" P L I E D → E eliminated.\n\n""GLIDE"" G L I D E → E eliminated.\n\nWithout E, we have to use U or Y.\n\n""BLUFF"" F eliminated.\n\n""JUMPY"" J U M P Y → J is less common, but possible. ""JUMPY"" has R? No, pattern must have R in second. ""JUMPY"" is J U M P Y, no R.\n\nWe need R in second.\n\n""JUMPS"" S eliminated.\n\nI think we have to go with one of the words we have.\n\nLet me choose ""DRILY"" because it has L which is a very common letter.\n\n""DRILY"": D R I L Y\n\nThis tests D, I, L, Y.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nAnother option: ""GRUB"" is 4 letters, not 5.\n\n""GRUBS"" S eliminated.\n\nSo I think ""DRILY"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: D is available, R is in position, I available, L available, Y available.\n\nYes.\n\nWe could do ""PRIVY"" but V is less common.\n\nOr ""WRYLY"" but repeated Y.\n\nI\'ll go with ""DRILY"".\n\nBut we have to make sure it\'s a valid word. ""Drily"" is an adverb meaning in a dry manner, but it\'s accepted as a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""grimy"" is common.\n\nTo have more common letters, what about ""BUILT""? But T eliminated and no R in second.\n\nAnother: ""GUILT"" G U I L T → T eliminated.\n\n""QUILT"" same.\n\n""BUOY"" not 5 letters.\n\nI think we have to use one of these.\n\nPerhaps ""BRICK"" but C eliminated.\n\nSo, I choose ""DRILY"".\n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a word with U.\n\n""DRUGS"" S eliminated.\n\n""DRUID"" D R U I D → that\'s 5 letters.

E eliminated, and Z is rare.\n\n""PRICE"" C and E eliminated.\n\nSo, I think ""DRILY"" is a solid choice.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""DRILY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: Eliminated letters C, A, N, E.

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: not in word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → second letter is R
- A: not in word (x)
- N: not in word (x)
- E: not in word (x)

Guess 2: FROST
- F: not in word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → confirmed
- O: not in word (x)
- S: not in word (x)
- T: not in word (x)

Guess 3: DRILY
- D: not in word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → confirmed
- I: not in word (x)
- L: correct position (✓) → so the fourth letter is L
- Y: correct position (✓) → so the fifth letter is Y

So new information:
- The fourth letter is L and the fifth letter is Y. So the word ends with LY: pattern _ R _ L Y
- Additionally, eliminated letters: A, C, D, E, F, I, N, O, S, T (from all guesses)

Eliminated letters: A, C, D, E, F, I, N, O, S, T

Remaining letters: B, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

But the word must have a vowel. The vowels left are U (since A, E, I, O are out). And Y is already in the word, but Y is at the end and we know it's there. However, we might need another vowel? Not necessarily, because Y at the end can satisfy the vowel requirement. But the word has to have vowels, and U is the only vowel option left besides Y, which is already placed.

So pattern: position 1: unknown, position 2: R, position 3: unknown, position 4: L, position 5: Y.

We know that position 3 cannot be any eliminated letter, and must be from the remaining set.

But note, the first and third letters must be from the remaining letters: B, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Now, since the word ends with LY, common words might have U at position 3 or other combinations.

For example: ? R ? L Y

We need to find a valid English word that fits.

Possible words:
- URLY? Not a word.
- CURLY? But C is eliminated.
- BURLY: B U R L Y → which is a word. B and U are available? 
  - B: yes, not eliminated.
  - U: yes, vowel, not eliminated.
  - R: confirmed in position.
  - L: confirmed in position.
  - Y: confirmed.

So ""BURLY"" is a candidate.

Other options:
- GURLY? Not a common word; probably not.
- HURLY: H U R L Y → ""Hurly"" is a word, meaning commotion or noise. H and U available.
- PURSY? P U R S Y → but S is eliminated, so no.
- PURTY? Not standard; and if, T is eliminated? Purty sometimes used but not common and might have T which is eliminated? ""Purty"" would be P U R T Y → T eliminated, so no.
- MERLY? Not a word.
- PERLY? Not a word.
- KURLY? Not a word, and K is available.
- JURLY? No.
- MURLY? Not a word.
- WURLY? Not a word.

Another common word: ""CURVY"" but C eliminated, and V? Pattern doesn't end with LY? ""Curvy"" is C U R V Y → positions: C at 1, U at 2? But we need R at 2? Here R is at 3? Not matching pattern.

We need the pattern: 1:?, 2:R, 3:?, 4:L, 5:Y

So ""BURLY"" fits: position 1:B, 2:U? No: ""BURLY"" is spelled B-U-R-L-Y? Let's check: 
B-U-R-L-Y → positions: 
1. B
2. U? But we need R at position 2. Here, U is at position 2 and R is at position 3? That doesn't fit the pattern because we know position 2 must be R.

This is a common mistake. The word ""BURLY"" is B U R L Y → so:
Position 1: B
Position 2: U
Position 3: R
Position 4: L
Position 5: Y

But we know that R is at position 2, so that doesn't match. In ""BURLY"", R is at position 3, not 2.

Therefore, ""BURLY"" is not possible.

Similarly, ""HURLY"": H U R L Y → same issue: R at position 3.

What words have R at position 2 and then a consonant before LY? 

For example:
- ""CARLY"" but C eliminated and A eliminated.
- ""GIRLY"" but G I R L Y → I eliminated? Guess 3 DRILY had I as x, so I is not in the word.
- ""BIRLY"" not a word.

Another possibility: ""CURLY"" but C and the vowel? C eliminated.

With U: 
- ""BURLY"" but R is not second.
- Words with pattern _ R _ L Y.

Consider:
- PURSY? But S eliminated, and PURSY is not common; anyway S out.
- ""MURLY"" not a word.
- ""WURLY"" not a word.

But we need U? Because without vowels, the word must have U or Y, but Y is at the end. Position 3 could be a vowel or a consonant? Not all English words require multiple vowels, but in this case, the third position could be a consonant.

For example, the word ""PRIMLY"" is 6 letters? Too long.

5-letter words: 
- ""BARLY"" B A R L Y → A eliminated? A is eliminated from guess 1.
- ""CURLY"" C eliminated.
- ""DIRLY"" D and I eliminated? D and I both out.
- ""FIRLY"" not a word, and I out.

But all our guesses have eliminated common vowels. Only U is left.

What about words like ""TRULY""? T R U L Y → T eliminated? T is eliminated from guess 2. Also, pattern is T-R-U-L-Y → positions 1:T, 2:R, 3:U, 4:L, 5:Y. But T is eliminated? T is marked as not in the word, so T cannot be first.

Similarly, ""GRUBB"" not a word.

Another word: ""CRYLY"" not a word.

Perhaps ""KRYLY""? No.

Let's list possible first letters: from remaining: B, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Z? And third letter: similarly, but it could be U.

For example, ""URUBU""? Not 5 letters.

""URUBU"" is 5: U-R-U-B-U → but positions: 1:U, 2:R, 3:U, 4:B, 5:U → that might be a word (a bird), but pattern: position 2 is R, position 4 must be L? But in this, position 4 is B, not L. So not.

We know position 4 is L, so it has to be _ R ? L Y

Now, the third letter ? must be a letter such that the word is valid.

Common words: 
- Ornly? Not a word.
- Knells? But that would be K-N-E-L-L-S, too long.

Perhaps ""PEARLY"" but too long.

I think of ""PERLY"" but not common.

With U: 
- ""BURLY"" but R not in second.
- ""CURLY"" same.
- ""MURLY"" not word.

But what about ""RURLY""? Not a word.

Another possibility: ""NURLY""? Not.

Perhaps ""HURLY"" same.

Wait, is there a word like ""GURLY""? Sometimes informal, but not standard.

We must consider that U can be in first or third position.

First position: U
Pattern: U R ? L Y

What words? ""URLY"" is not a word. ""URDLY""? Not.

""URBLY""? No.

Perhaps ""CURLY"" has different spelling? C U R L Y → R position 3.

Same.

Third position: ? R U L Y

Examples:
- ""BRULY""? Not a word.
- ""GRULY""? No.
- ""PRULY""? No.
- ""WRULY""? No.
- ""VOLT""? Not 5 letters.

Another common word: ""TURLY"" not a word.

""TURLY"" not.

But we have eliminated T.

Remember eliminated letters.

Position 1: can be B, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Z? etc.

Position 3: can be B, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

But for the word to be valid, it must be in dictionary.

Another word: ""CRUDY"" but C eliminated and not ending LY.

But we need LY ending.

So pattern: 1:? 2:R 3:? 4:L 5:Y

And we know from DRILY that L and Y are correct and in position.

Now, possible words in English:

- ""MERLY""? Not common; not in standard dictionary.
- ""PERLY"" same.
- ""BURLY"" doesn't match pattern.
- ""HURLY"" doesn't.
- ""KAYLY"" not, and A eliminated.

But another word: ""PURLY"" P U R L Y → R is at position 3? No: P-U-R-L-Y → positions: 1.P, 2.U, 3.R, 4.L,5.Y → but R should be at position 2? Here it's at 3.

So not.

Perhaps they are no such words? But there must be.

What about ""RALLY""? But R is at position 1? And A eliminated, L is at 3? R A L L Y → positions:1.R, 2.A, 3.L, 4.L,5.Y → not matching, and A eliminated.

""RELY"" is 4 letters.

""BERLEY"" too long.

""BARLY"" B A R L Y → A eliminated.

But A is out.

With U: is there a word where the third letter is U? Like ? R U L Y

For example: 
- ""BRULY""? Not word.
- ""GRULY""? No.
- ""PRULY""? No.
- ""CRULY""? C out.

""U"" is the only vowel left.

What about ""DRUXY""? D out, and X.

But D out.

Perhaps I missed a word.

Let me think differently. Possible common words ending with LY: daily, but we have D and A eliminated.

Early: E and A out.

Only: O out, L not fourth? O-N-L-Y.

Family: F A M I L Y → many letters eliminated.

But none fit.

Anagram: with the pattern _ R _ L Y and not using eliminated letters.

For example: W R U L Y — ""wruly""? Not a word, or misspelling of unruly.

Unruly is U N R U L Y, 6 letters.

Or ""ruly"", which is 4 letters.

But ""wruly"" doesn't exist.

Another: P R I L Y — but I eliminated, from DRILY feedback.

""PRILY"" not a word.

""GRILLY"" G R I L L Y — I eliminated, and repeated L? But pattern: G-R-I-L-L-Y? 6 letters.

5 letters: ""GRILLY"" would be G R I L Y? But that's 5: G R I L Y → but I is eliminated, and in DRILY, I was not in the word, so no.

I is out.

U must be in position 3.

So position 3 must be U.

Then pattern: _ R U L Y

What can the first letter be? From remaining: B, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

B: ""BRULY"" — not a word.

H: ""HRULY"" — not a word.

K: ""KRULY"" — not.

M: ""MRULY"" — no.

P: ""PRULY"" — no.

W: ""WRULY"" — not a word.

V: ""VRULY"" — no.

G: ""GRULY"" — no.

Perhaps there is a word like ""burly"" but we know it doesn't fit.

Another idea: the word ""CURLY"" is the common one, but C eliminated.

Or ""furl not 5 letters.

Perhaps "" surly "" but S is eliminated, and surly is S U R L Y → S at 1, eliminated.

T for ""truly"" eliminated.

But we are stuck.

Perhaps ""burry"" but not ending LY.

Or ""merle"" not ending Y.

But we must have LY at the end.

Another possibility: ""PERKY"" not LY.

No.

Perhaps I misremembered the feedback.

Guess 3: DRILY feedback: D(x) R(✓) I(x) L(✓) Y(✓)

So L is fourth letter, Y is fifth.

Secret word: ? R ? L Y

And all feedback is consistent.

Now, what words exist? Let's search for English words with pattern _ R _ L Y.

One word: ""BARLEY"" but 6 letters.

5-letter: ""PEARLY"" 6.

In 5 letters: ""curly"", ""burl nothing"", ""hurly"" is hurlY? But ""hurly"" is H U R L Y — but as above, positions 1.H, 2.U, 3.R, 4.L,5.Y, so R at position 3, not 2.

Similarly, ""surly"" S U R L Y: position 1.S, 2.U, 3.R,...

No word with R at position 2?

For example, ""merit"" not LY ending.

Perhaps ""early"" but E and A out.

Only U is left, but no common word with ""UR  LY"", because U at position 2 or 3.

Position 2 is R, so position 1 and 3 are consonants or U.

But pattern: let position 1 be X, position 3 be U, then X R U L Y.

What X make a word?

X- example: ""B has brule? Not.

""G rule? Not.

I think I found: ""curly"" but C not allowed.

Or ""turfy"" not LY.

Perhaps ""nurly"" not a word.

Another idea: ""pryly"" ""pryly"" not a word.

Or ""WRI L Y"" written differently.

Perhaps ""GRILY"" not.

I recall that ""U"" can be used, but let's accept that ""BURLY"" is not it because of positions.

Wait a minute, we have feedback that I in ""DRILY"" was not in the word, but it doesn't say that U is in or not. We haven't tested U so far.

We also have other letters.

But in the pattern, if position 3 is a consonant, then the word may not have a vowel except Y at the end? But Y might be considered a vowel here, so it could be sufficient.

For example, ""crim Y"" crim is not word.

""Gr  and"" not.

Example words: ""Wryly"" is already used, and w is available, but in ""WRYLY"" it is W-R-Y-L-Y → letters W, R, Y, L, Y. But Y repeated, and positions: 1.W, 2.R, 3.Y, 4.L,5.Y — but position 3 is Y, and position 5 is Y? But in our pattern, position 5 is Y, so it would be fixed, but position 3 is Y? ""WRYLY"" is a valid word. It's an adverb.

And it fits the pattern: W R Y L Y.

Position 1: W
Position 2: R
Position 3: Y
Position 4: L
Position 5: Y

But L is position 4? In this case, position 4 is L? ""WRYLY"" has position 4 and 5 as L and Y? No: W-R-Y-L-Y, so:

Position 1: W
Position 2: R
Position 3: Y
Position 4: L
Position 5: Y

So position 4 is L and position 5 is Y, which matches our pattern.

And letters: W is available (not eliminated), R is correct, Y is tested in position 3? But in the feedback, from guess 3, Y is at position 5 and was correct, but that doesn't prevent Y from being elsewhere? In ""DRILY"", Y was at position 5 and was correct, but it doesn't imply that Y cannot be in other positions. Similarly, L is at position 4 and was correct.

But in ""WRYLY"", we have Y at position 3 and 5, and L at position 4.

Importantly, we have not received feedback that Y is in the word elsewhere; in guess 3, Y was at position 5 and was correct, but if the secret word has Y at position 3 also, it should have been indicated? Let's see the feedback rules.

The feedback for DRILY: position 1: D (x), position 2: R (✓), position 3: I (x), position 4: L (✓), position 5: Y (✓).

For position 3: I was guessed and not in the word (x), so no I.
But for y in position 5, it was correct.

If the secret word had a Y at position 3, should it have been indicated in the feedback for position 3? In guess 3, position 3 was I, not Y, so we didn't test Y there.

Or positionally, the feedback tells us about the guessed letter at its position.

So if the secret word has Y at position 3, we don't know yet.

In ""WRYLY"", letters: W, R, Y, L, Y. L and Y at correct positions.

Available letters: W and Y? Y is already placed at position 5, but in this guess, W is new.

But in guess 3, we have not tested Y at other positions, so ok.

And the word is valid.

Other options: if not ""WRYLY"", what else?

""URBLY"" not a word.

So ""WRYLY"" seems a possibility.

Another: ""PRYLY"" not word.

""GRYLY"" not.

So I think ""WRYLY"" is a candidate.

But we have 6 guesses, so we can try.

Another word: ""BERYL"" is B E R Y L, not ending with LY and E eliminated.

We'll go with ""WRYLY"".

But in ""WRYLY"", it has two Y's, and we haven't tested Y position 3.

If secret word is ""WRYLY"", then in guess 3 DRILY, which has I at position 3 and Y at 5, the secret word has no I, has Y at 5 and another at 3, so the feedback for DRILY should still be D(x), R(✓), I(x), L(✓), Y(✓) because L is at 4, and Y at 5 correct, and no D, I. So consistent.

So it's possible.

Other words? ""GRILLY"" with I eliminated.

Or ""BRILLY"" not word.

So ""WRYLY"" is a word.

Perhaps ""CURLY"" with C eliminated.

So I think we make the guess ""WRYLY"".

But to be thorough, let's see if there is a word with U.

For example, if secret word is U R ... but what? ""UR PLY"" not.

So no common word with U.

Therefore, ""WRYLY"" is a guess.

But ""WRYLY"" contains the letter Y at position 3, which we haven't confirmed yet.

Since we have no other good options, we can guess ""WRYLY"".
</think>
Based on the cumulative feedback:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: Confirmed R in position 2. Eliminated C, A, N, E.
- **Guess 2 (FROST)**: Confirmed R in position 2. Eliminated F, O, S, T.
- **Guess 3 (DRILY)**: Confirmed R in position 2, L in position 4, and Y in position 5. Eliminated D, I.

Pattern derived: **Secret word is _ R _ L Y**.

Eliminated letters: **A, C, D, E, F, I, N, O, S, T**.

Remaining possible letters: B, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

### Key insights:
- The word must end with ""LY"".
- Position 3 must be a valid letter from the remaining set. Given all vowels except U are eliminated and U is unused, it is a strong candidate for position 3 (though Y at position 5 may suffice as the vowel).
- Common words fitting the pattern (_ R _ L Y) with remaining letters were evaluated:
  - ""BURLY"" and ""HURLY"" have R in position 3 (incorrect position).
  - ""WRYLY"" is a valid English word (adverb meaning ""in a wry manner"") with the pattern W R Y L Y. It fits:
    - Position 1: W (untested, available).
    - Position 2: R (confirmed).
    - Position 3: Y (untested elsewhere, available).
    - Position 4: L (confirmed).
    - Position 5: Y (confirmed).
  - No other common valid words fit the pattern with remaining letters (e.g., ""PURLY"" is non-standard; ""CURLY"" has eliminated C).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Guess ""WRYLY"" to test W and the possibility of Y in position 3.
- If correct, the word is solved. If not, feedback on W and position 3 of Y will narrow options to rare words (e.g., ""URUBU"" isn't viable due to L position) or confirm U must be used.

<guess>WRYLY</guess>",WRYLY,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: not in word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → second letter is R
- A: not in word (x)
- N: not in word (x)
- E: not in word (x)

Guess 2: FROST
- F: not in word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → confirmed
- O: not in word (x)
- S: not in word (x)
- T: not in word (x)

Guess 3: DRILY
- D: not in word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → confirmed
- I: not in word (x)
- L: correct position (✓) → so the fourth letter is L
- Y: correct position (✓) → so the fifth letter is Y

So new information:
- The fourth letter is L and the fifth letter is Y. So the word ends with LY: pattern _ R _ L Y
- Additionally, eliminated letters: A, C, D, E, F, I, N, O, S, T (from all guesses)

Eliminated letters: A, C, D, E, F, I, N, O, S, T

Remaining letters: B, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

But the word must have a vowel. The vowels left are U (since A, E, I, O are out). And Y is already in the word, but Y is at the end and we know it's there. However, we might need another vowel? Not necessarily, because Y at the end can satisfy the vowel requirement. But the word has to have vowels, and U is the only vowel option left besides Y, which is already placed.

So pattern: position 1: unknown, position 2: R, position 3: unknown, position 4: L, position 5: Y.

We know that position 3 cannot be any eliminated letter, and must be from the remaining set.

But note, the first and third letters must be from the remaining letters: B, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Now, since the word ends with LY, common words might have U at position 3 or other combinations.

For example: ? R ? L Y

We need to find a valid English word that fits.

Possible words:
- URLY? Not a word.
- CURLY? But C is eliminated.
- BURLY: B U R L Y → which is a word. B and U are available? 
  - B: yes, not eliminated.
  - U: yes, vowel, not eliminated.
  - R: confirmed in position.
  - L: confirmed in position.
  - Y: confirmed.

So ""BURLY"" is a candidate.

Other options:
- GURLY? Not a common word; probably not.
- HURLY: H U R L Y → ""Hurly"" is a word, meaning commotion or noise. H and U available.
- PURSY? P U R S Y → but S is eliminated, so no.
- PURTY? Not standard; and if, T is eliminated? Purty sometimes used but not common and might have T which is eliminated? ""Purty"" would be P U R T Y → T eliminated, so no.
- MERLY? Not a word.
- PERLY? Not a word.
- KURLY? Not a word, and K is available.
- JURLY? No.
- MURLY? Not a word.
- WURLY? Not a word.

Another common word: ""CURVY"" but C eliminated, and V? Pattern doesn't end with LY? ""Curvy"" is C U R V Y → positions: C at 1, U at 2? But we need R at 2? Here R is at 3? Not matching pattern.

We need the pattern: 1:?, 2:R, 3:?, 4:L, 5:Y

So ""BURLY"" fits: position 1:B, 2:U? No: ""BURLY"" is spelled B-U-R-L-Y? Let's check: 
B-U-R-L-Y → positions: 
1. B
2. U? But we need R at position 2. Here, U is at position 2 and R is at position 3? That doesn't fit the pattern because we know position 2 must be R.

This is a common mistake. The word ""BURLY"" is B U R L Y → so:
Position 1: B
Position 2: U
Position 3: R
Position 4: L
Position 5: Y

But we know that R is at position 2, so that doesn't match. In ""BURLY"", R is at position 3, not 2.

Therefore, ""BURLY"" is not possible.

Similarly, ""HURLY"": H U R L Y → same issue: R at position 3.

What words have R at position 2 and then a consonant before LY? 

For example:
- ""CARLY"" but C eliminated and A eliminated.
- ""GIRLY"" but G I R L Y → I eliminated? Guess 3 DRILY had I as x, so I is not in the word.
- ""BIRLY"" not a word.

Another possibility: ""CURLY"" but C and the vowel? C eliminated.

With U: 
- ""BURLY"" but R is not second.
- Words with pattern _ R _ L Y.

Consider:
- PURSY? But S eliminated, and PURSY is not common; anyway S out.
- ""MURLY"" not a word.
- ""WURLY"" not a word.

But we need U? Because without vowels, the word must have U or Y, but Y is at the end. Position 3 could be a vowel or a consonant? Not all English words require multiple vowels, but in this case, the third position could be a consonant.

For example, the word ""PRIMLY"" is 6 letters? Too long.

5-letter words: 
- ""BARLY"" B A R L Y → A eliminated? A is eliminated from guess 1.
- ""CURLY"" C eliminated.
- ""DIRLY"" D and I eliminated? D and I both out.
- ""FIRLY"" not a word, and I out.

But all our guesses have eliminated common vowels. Only U is left.

What about words like ""TRULY""? T R U L Y → T eliminated? T is eliminated from guess 2. Also, pattern is T-R-U-L-Y → positions 1:T, 2:R, 3:U, 4:L, 5:Y. But T is eliminated? T is marked as not in the word, so T cannot be first.

Similarly, ""GRUBB"" not a word.

Another word: ""CRYLY"" not a word.

Perhaps ""KRYLY""? No.

Let's list possible first letters: from remaining: B, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Z? And third letter: similarly, but it could be U.

For example, ""URUBU""? Not 5 letters.

""URUBU"" is 5: U-R-U-B-U → but positions: 1:U, 2:R, 3:U, 4:B, 5:U → that might be a word (a bird), but pattern: position 2 is R, position 4 must be L? But in this, position 4 is B, not L. So not.

We know position 4 is L, so it has to be _ R ? L Y

Now, the third letter ? must be a letter such that the word is valid.

Common words: 
- Ornly? Not a word.
- Knells? But that would be K-N-E-L-L-S, too long.

Perhaps ""PEARLY"" but too long.

I think of ""PERLY"" but not common.

With U: 
- ""BURLY"" but R not in second.
- ""CURLY"" same.
- ""MURLY"" not word.

But what about ""RURLY""? Not a word.

Another possibility: ""NURLY""? Not.

Perhaps ""HURLY"" same.

Wait, is there a word like ""GURLY""? Sometimes informal, but not standard.

We must consider that U can be in first or third position.

First position: U
Pattern: U R ? L Y

What words? ""URLY"" is not a word. ""URDLY""? Not.

""URBLY""? No.

Perhaps ""CURLY"" has different spelling? C U R L Y → R position 3.

Same.

Third position: ? R U L Y

Examples:
- ""BRULY""? Not a word.
- ""GRULY""? No.
- ""PRULY""? No.
- ""WRULY""? No.
- ""VOLT""? Not 5 letters.

Another common word: ""TURLY"" not a word.

""TURLY"" not.

But we have eliminated T.

Remember eliminated letters.

Position 1: can be B, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Z? etc.

Position 3: can be B, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

But for the word to be valid, it must be in dictionary.

Another word: ""CRUDY"" but C eliminated and not ending LY.

But we need LY ending.

So pattern: 1:? 2:R 3:? 4:L 5:Y

And we know from DRILY that L and Y are correct and in position.

Now, possible words in English:

- ""MERLY""? Not common; not in standard dictionary.
- ""PERLY"" same.
- ""BURLY"" doesn't match pattern.
- ""HURLY"" doesn't.
- ""KAYLY"" not, and A eliminated.

But another word: ""PURLY"" P U R L Y → R is at position 3? No: P-U-R-L-Y → positions: 1.P, 2.U, 3.R, 4.L,5.Y → but R should be at position 2? Here it's at 3.

So not.

Perhaps they are no such words? But there must be.

What about ""RALLY""? But R is at position 1? And A eliminated, L is at 3? R A L L Y → positions:1.R, 2.A, 3.L, 4.L,5.Y → not matching, and A eliminated.

""RELY"" is 4 letters.

""BERLEY"" too long.

""BARLY"" B A R L Y → A eliminated.

But A is out.

With U: is there a word where the third letter is U? Like ? R U L Y

For example: 
- ""BRULY""? Not word.
- ""GRULY""? No.
- ""PRULY""? No.
- ""CRULY""? C out.

""U"" is the only vowel left.

What about ""DRUXY""? D out, and X.

But D out.

Perhaps I missed a word.

Let me think differently. Possible common words ending with LY: daily, but we have D and A eliminated.

Early: E and A out.

Only: O out, L not fourth? O-N-L-Y.

Family: F A M I L Y → many letters eliminated.

But none fit.

Anagram: with the pattern _ R _ L Y and not using eliminated letters.

For example: W R U L Y — ""wruly""? Not a word, or misspelling of unruly.

Unruly is U N R U L Y, 6 letters.

Or ""ruly"", which is 4 letters.

But ""wruly"" doesn't exist.

Another: P R I L Y — but I eliminated, from DRILY feedback.

""PRILY"" not a word.

""GRILLY"" G R I L L Y — I eliminated, and repeated L? But pattern: G-R-I-L-L-Y? 6 letters.

5 letters: ""GRILLY"" would be G R I L Y? But that's 5: G R I L Y → but I is eliminated, and in DRILY, I was not in the word, so no.

I is out.

U must be in position 3.

So position 3 must be U.

Then pattern: _ R U L Y

What can the first letter be? From remaining: B, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

B: ""BRULY"" — not a word.

H: ""HRULY"" — not a word.

K: ""KRULY"" — not.

M: ""MRULY"" — no.

P: ""PRULY"" — no.

W: ""WRULY"" — not a word.

V: ""VRULY"" — no.

G: ""GRULY"" — no.

Perhaps there is a word like ""burly"" but we know it doesn't fit.

Another idea: the word ""CURLY"" is the common one, but C eliminated.

Or ""furl not 5 letters.

Perhaps "" surly "" but S is eliminated, and surly is S U R L Y → S at 1, eliminated.

T for ""truly"" eliminated.

But we are stuck.

Perhaps ""burry"" but not ending LY.

Or ""merle"" not ending Y.

But we must have LY at the end.

Another possibility: ""PERKY"" not LY.

No.

Perhaps I misremembered the feedback.

Guess 3: DRILY feedback: D(x) R(✓) I(x) L(✓) Y(✓)

So L is fourth letter, Y is fifth.

Secret word: ? R ? L Y

And all feedback is consistent.

Now, what words exist? Let's search for English words with pattern _ R _ L Y.

One word: ""BARLEY"" but 6 letters.

5-letter: ""PEARLY"" 6.

In 5 letters: ""curly"", ""burl nothing"", ""hurly"" is hurlY? But ""hurly"" is H U R L Y — but as above, positions 1.H, 2.U, 3.R, 4.L,5.Y, so R at position 3, not 2.

Similarly, ""surly"" S U R L Y: position 1.S, 2.U, 3.R,...

No word with R at position 2?

For example, ""merit"" not LY ending.

Perhaps ""early"" but E and A out.

Only U is left, but no common word with ""UR  LY"", because U at position 2 or 3.

Position 2 is R, so position 1 and 3 are consonants or U.

But pattern: let position 1 be X, position 3 be U, then X R U L Y.

What X make a word?

X- example: ""B has brule? Not.

""G rule? Not.

I think I found: ""curly"" but C not allowed.

Or ""turfy"" not LY.

Perhaps ""nurly"" not a word.

Another idea: ""pryly"" ""pryly"" not a word.

Or ""WRI L Y"" written differently.

Perhaps ""GRILY"" not.

I recall that ""U"" can be used, but let's accept that ""BURLY"" is not it because of positions.

Wait a minute, we have feedback that I in ""DRILY"" was not in the word, but it doesn't say that U is in or not. We haven't tested U so far.

We also have other letters.

But in the pattern, if position 3 is a consonant, then the word may not have a vowel except Y at the end? But Y might be considered a vowel here, so it could be sufficient.

For example, ""crim Y"" crim is not word.

""Gr  and"" not.

Example words: ""Wryly"" is already used, and w is available, but in ""WRYLY"" it is W-R-Y-L-Y → letters W, R, Y, L, Y. But Y repeated, and positions: 1.W, 2.R, 3.Y, 4.L,5.Y — but position 3 is Y, and position 5 is Y? But in our pattern, position 5 is Y, so it would be fixed, but position 3 is Y? ""WRYLY"" is a valid word. It's an adverb.

And it fits the pattern: W R Y L Y.

Position 1: W
Position 2: R
Position 3: Y
Position 4: L
Position 5: Y

But L is position 4? In this case, position 4 is L? ""WRYLY"" has position 4 and 5 as L and Y? No: W-R-Y-L-Y, so:

Position 1: W
Position 2: R
Position 3: Y
Position 4: L
Position 5: Y

So position 4 is L and position 5 is Y, which matches our pattern.

And letters: W is available (not eliminated), R is correct, Y is tested in position 3? But in the feedback, from guess 3, Y is at position 5 and was correct, but that doesn't prevent Y from being elsewhere? In ""DRILY"", Y was at position 5 and was correct, but it doesn't imply that Y cannot be in other positions. Similarly, L is at position 4 and was correct.

But in ""WRYLY"", we have Y at position 3 and 5, and L at position 4.

Importantly, we have not received feedback that Y is in the word elsewhere; in guess 3, Y was at position 5 and was correct, but if the secret word has Y at position 3 also, it should have been indicated? Let's see the feedback rules.

The feedback for DRILY: position 1: D (x), position 2: R (✓), position 3: I (x), position 4: L (✓), position 5: Y (✓).

For position 3: I was guessed and not in the word (x), so no I.
But for y in position 5, it was correct.

If the secret word had a Y at position 3, should it have been indicated in the feedback for position 3? In guess 3, position 3 was I, not Y, so we didn't test Y there.

Or positionally, the feedback tells us about the guessed letter at its position.

So if the secret word has Y at position 3, we don't know yet.

In ""WRYLY"", letters: W, R, Y, L, Y. L and Y at correct positions.

Available letters: W and Y? Y is already placed at position 5, but in this guess, W is new.

But in guess 3, we have not tested Y at other positions, so ok.

And the word is valid.

Other options: if not ""WRYLY"", what else?

""URBLY"" not a word.

So ""WRYLY"" seems a possibility.

Another: ""PRYLY"" not word.

""GRYLY"" not.

So I think ""WRYLY"" is a candidate.

But we have 6 guesses, so we can try.

Another word: ""BERYL"" is B E R Y L, not ending with LY and E eliminated.

We'll go with ""WRYLY"".

But in ""WRYLY"", it has two Y's, and we haven't tested Y position 3.

If secret word is ""WRYLY"", then in guess 3 DRILY, which has I at position 3 and Y at 5, the secret word has no I, has Y at 5 and another at 3, so the feedback for DRILY should still be D(x), R(✓), I(x), L(✓), Y(✓) because L is at 4, and Y at 5 correct, and no D, I. So consistent.

So it's possible.

Other words? ""GRILLY"" with I eliminated.

Or ""BRILLY"" not word.

So ""WRYLY"" is a word.

Perhaps ""CURLY"" with C eliminated.

So I think we make the guess ""WRYLY"".

But to be thorough, let's see if there is a word with U.

For example, if secret word is U R ... but what? ""UR PLY"" not.

So no common word with U.

Therefore, ""WRYLY"" is a guess.

But ""WRYLY"" contains the letter Y at position 3, which we haven't confirmed yet.

Since we have no other good options, we can guess ""WRYLY"".Based on the cumulative feedback:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: Confirmed R in position 2. Eliminated C, A, N, E.
- **Guess 2 (FROST)**: Confirmed R in position 2. Eliminated F, O, S, T.
- **Guess 3 (DRILY)**: Confirmed R in position 2, L in position 4, and Y in position 5. Eliminated D, I.

Pattern derived: **Secret word is _ R _ L Y**.

Eliminated letters: **A, C, D, E, F, I, N, O, S, T**.

Remaining possible letters: B, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

### Key insights:
- The word must end with ""LY"".
- Position 3 must be a valid letter from the remaining set. Given all vowels except U are eliminated and U is unused, it is a strong candidate for position 3 (though Y at position 5 may suffice as the vowel).
- Common words fitting the pattern (_ R _ L Y) with remaining letters were evaluated:
  - ""BURLY"" and ""HURLY"" have R in position 3 (incorrect position).
  - ""WRYLY"" is a valid English word (adverb meaning ""in a wry manner"") with the pattern W R Y L Y. It fits:
    - Position 1: W (untested, available).
    - Position 2: R (confirmed).
    - Position 3: Y (untested elsewhere, available).
    - Position 4: L (confirmed).
    - Position 5: Y (confirmed).
  - No other common valid words fit the pattern with remaining letters (e.g., ""PURLY"" is non-standard; ""CURLY"" has eliminated C).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Guess ""WRYLY"" to test W and the possibility of Y in position 3.
- If correct, the word is solved. If not, feedback on W and position 3 of Y will narrow options to rare words (e.g., ""URUBU"" isn't viable due to L position) or confirm U must be used.",Guess 4: WRYLY -> FEEDBACK: W(✓) R(✓) Y(✓) L(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
