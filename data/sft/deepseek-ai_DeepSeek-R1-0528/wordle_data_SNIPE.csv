We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any previous feedback.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 I recall that some people use words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"" because they contain common letters.
 Let me choose ""RAISE"" because it has two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (R, S) and I (which is sometimes a vowel).

 However, note that the example used ""STORM"" but I want a better one.

 Another popular starting word is ""SOARE"" (a type of hawk), but it might be too obscure. I should stick to common words.

 Alternatively, ""AROSE"" is a common word? But let's check: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Actually, in my knowledge, ""RAISE"" is a valid and common word.

 So, I'll go with ""RAISE"".

For the first guess, I don't have any prior feedback to work with, so I'll choose a strategic starting word. A good opener should:
- Include common letters (especially vowels) to maximize information
- Avoid repeating letters
- Use frequent consonants like R, S, T

The word **""RAISE""** is ideal because:
- Contains 3 of the top 7 most common English letters (R, A, S)
- Uses two vowels (A and E) and three consonants
- No repeated letters
- High frequency letters increase the chance of getting valuable feedback (✓ or -)

This will help narrow down possibilities regardless of the secret word.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so the third letter is I)
- S: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so the fifth letter is E)

So, we know:
- The secret word has the letter I in the third position and E in the fifth position. So the word pattern is: _ _ I _ E
- The letter S is in the word but not in the fourth position (since it was in the fourth position in ""RAISE"" and got a '-', meaning it's present but misplaced). Also, note that S cannot be in the third or fifth because those are fixed as I and E, and we know S is not in the fourth. So S must be in either the first or second position.
- The letters R and A are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Has 'I' as the third letter and 'E' as the fifth letter.
- Includes the letter 'S' but not in the fourth position (and not in the third or fifth, so only first or second).
- Does not contain R or A.

Additionally, we should try to test other common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for S: first or second.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ _ I _ E and contain S, and avoid R and A.

We can also consider that we have two positions to fill (first and second) and one of them might be S, and the fourth position is open (but we know it's not S, and not R or A).

We need to guess a word that might help us identify the remaining letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, etc.

Let me try to list some words that fit the pattern:

- The word must be _ _ I _ E

Possibilities:
- If S is in the first position: S _ I _ E
  - Examples: SPINE, SHINE, SMITE, SUITE, etc. But note we cannot use R or A, so avoid those.

- If S is in the second position: _ S I _ E
  - Examples: ONSET (but ONSET has E in the fifth? O N S E T -> no, because the third letter is S, not I. We need third letter I and fifth E. So _ S I _ E: words like OSSIE (not common), but let's think: POSIE? Not a word. Maybe ""USINE"" (not English). 

Alternatively, we can think of words that have S and the pattern.

Another idea: since we know S is in the word but not in the fourth position, and we have to place it in first or second, we can try a word that puts S in the first position to test that.

But also, we need to cover other common letters.

Let me try to form a word:

Option 1: Put S in the first position: S _ I _ E
  - We need a letter for the second and fourth. The fourth cannot be S (already known) and not R or A. Also, we haven't tested many consonants.
  - Possible words: 
      - SHINE: H and N are new. But note, we have to check if it's valid. SHINE: S H I N E -> third is I, fifth is E. And S is in first, which is a new position. Also, no R or A.
      - SMITE: S M I T E -> T is new, and M is new.
      - SUITE: S U I T E -> U and T are new.

Option 2: Put S in the second position: _ S I _ E
  - Words: 
      - O S I E R -> but that has R, which is not allowed (we know R is absent). Also, it's 5 letters? O-S-I-E-R is 5, but we have E in fifth? O S I E R: positions: 1:O, 2:S, 3:I, 4:E, 5:R -> but we need fifth to be E, but here it's R. So not.
      - We need the fifth to be E. So pattern: _ S I _ E
      - Possible: USINE? Not a word. 
      - Maybe ""CISKE"" not a word. 
      - How about ""POSIT"" but that ends with T, not E. 
      - Actually, it's hard. Let me think: is there a word like ""ASSIE""? Not common and has A which is absent.

Perhaps putting S in the first position is easier.

We can also consider that the fourth position is open and we don't know what it is. We should try to test a common letter there.

But note: we have two positions to discover: first, second, and fourth. But we know one of the first two must be S? Actually, no: we know S is in the word, but it could be in the first or second position. But we don't know which. So we have to cover both possibilities.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S in the second position to test that, but we need a valid word.

After some thought, I found:
- For S in the second position: words like ""OSTIA"" but that has A and ends with A, not E. Not matching.
  Actually, I recall ""BASIC"" but that doesn't end with E.

Another idea: the word ""SPIRE"" but that has R which is absent. Not allowed.

Wait, let me use a word that doesn't necessarily have S in the first two, but we know S must be in the word so we have to include it. But we can put it in a different position? No, because the feedback said S is in the word but not in the fourth position, and the third and fifth are fixed, so it must be in first or second.

So we must put S in either first or second.

Given the difficulty of finding a word with S in the second position, I'll go with S in the first position.

So, pattern: S _ I _ E

We need to choose the second and fourth letters. We should choose common letters that we haven't tested.

We haven't tested: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

We can try:

- SHINE: S H I N E -> H in second, N in fourth. This tests H and N.
- SMITE: S M I T E -> M in second, T in fourth. Tests M and T.
- SUITE: S U I T E -> U in second, T in fourth. Tests U and T.

But note: in SUITE, the fourth letter is T and fifth is E, so it fits.

We also have to avoid letters we know are absent: R and A.

All of these avoid R and A.

Which one to choose? We want to maximize information. We can choose a word that has common letters.

SHINE: H and N are common.
SMITE: M and T are common.
SUITE: U and T (U is less common).

SHINE might be a good choice because it has two common consonants.

But note: we already know that the word has an I in third and E in fifth, and S somewhere. So by testing SHINE, we can check if H and N are present.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has a letter that might be in the fourth position.

But we don't have much to go on.

I think SHINE is a good candidate.

But let me check: is SHINE a valid word? Yes.

So, let's go with SHINE.

But wait: what if the secret word has S in the second position? Then by putting S in the first, we might get a '-' for S, which would tell us that S is not in the first, so it must be in the second. That's valuable information.

So, if we guess SHINE and S is in the first, then:
- If the secret word has S in the first, we get ✓ for S.
- If the secret word has S in the second, we get '-' for S (since it's present but in the wrong position).

Either way, we get information about S's position.

Similarly, we test H and N.

So, I think SHINE is a good guess.

But note: the feedback for the first guess said S is in the word but not in the fourth position. In SHINE, we are putting S in the first, which is a new position, so we can see if it's correct or not.

We are also putting H in the second and N in the fourth.

If the secret word has S in the second position, then in SHINE, S would get a '-' (because it's present but should be in second, not first). And H would be evaluated: if H is not in the word, it would be 'x', and if it is, it might be in the wrong position or right? But the second position in the secret word is unknown.

Similarly for N.

So, it's a good test.

Therefore, I'll guess ""SHINE"".

But let me see if there's a better word. Another common one is ""SLICE"", but that has L and C, and also we have to avoid A and R. But SLICE: S L I C E -> but the fourth letter is C. However, we know that the fourth position might be anything. But note, in the first guess, we had S in the fourth and it was wrong, but that doesn't prevent C from being there. However, SLICE has L and C, which are also common.

But SHINE seems equally good.

Alternatively, ""SPINE"": S P I N E -> tests P and N. But P is less common than H? Actually, H is more common.

I think SHINE is fine.

So, my next guess: SHINE

Format: <guess>SHINE</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- **R** and **A** are absent (x), so they can be excluded from future guesses.
- **I** is correct and in the right position (✓), so the third letter of the secret word is **I**.
- **S** is present but misplaced (-), meaning it must be in the secret word but not in the fourth position. Since the third and fifth positions are fixed as **I** and **E**, **S** must be in either the first or second position.
- **E** is correct and in the right position (✓), so the fifth letter is **E**.

This gives us the following pattern for the secret word: `_ _ I _ E`, with **S** in position 1 or 2, and no **R** or **A**.

For the second guess, I chose **SHINE** because:
- It fits the pattern `_ _ I _ E` (specifically, `S H I N E`).
- It tests **S** in the first position (to determine if **S** belongs there or in the second position).
- It introduces new common letters (**H** and **N**) to gather more information.
- It avoids excluded letters (**R** and **A**).

<guess>SHINE</guess>",SHINE,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)

- I: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so the third letter is I)
- S: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so the fifth letter is E)

So, we know:
- The secret word has the letter I in the third position and E in the fifth position. So the word pattern is: _ _ I _ E
- The letter S is in the word but not in the fourth position (since it was in the fourth position in ""RAISE"" and got a '-', meaning it's present but misplaced). Also, note that S cannot be in the third or fifth because those are fixed as I and E, and we know S is not in the fourth. So S must be in either the first or second position.
- The letters R and A are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Has 'I' as the third letter and 'E' as the fifth letter.
- Includes the letter 'S' but not in the fourth position (and not in the third or fifth, so only first or second).
- Does not contain R or A.

Additionally, we should try to test other common letters to get more information.

But SHINE seems equally good.

Alternatively, ""SPINE"": S P I N E -> tests P and N. But P is less common than H? Actually, H is more common.

I think SHINE is fine.

So, my next guess: SHINE

Format: <guess>SHINE</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- **R** and **A** are absent (x), so they can be excluded from future guesses.
- **I** is correct and in the right position (✓), so the third letter of the secret word is **I**.
- **S** is present but misplaced (-), meaning it must be in the secret word but not in the fourth position. Since the third and fifth positions are fixed as **I** and **E**, **S** must be in either the first or second position.
- **E** is correct and in the right position (✓), so the fifth letter is **E**.

This gives us the following pattern for the secret word: `_ _ I _ E`, with **S** in position 1 or 2, and no **R** or **A**.

For the second guess, I chose **SHINE** because:
- It fits the pattern `_ _ I _ E` (specifically, `S H I N E`).
- It tests **S** in the first position (to determine if **S** belongs there or in the second position).
- It introduces new common letters (**H** and **N**) to gather more information.
- It avoids excluded letters (**R** and **A**).",Guess 2: SHINE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) I(✓) N(-) E(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any previous feedback.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 I recall that some people use words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"" because they contain common letters.
 Let me choose ""RAISE"" because it has two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (R, S) and I (which is sometimes a vowel).

 However, note that the example used ""STORM"" but I want a better one.

 Another popular starting word is ""SOARE"" (a type of hawk), but it might be too obscure. I should stick to common words.

 Alternatively, ""AROSE"" is a common word? But let's check: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Actually, in my knowledge, ""RAISE"" is a valid and common word.

 So, I'll go with ""RAISE"".

 Format: <guess>RAISE</guess>For the first guess, I don't have any prior feedback to work with, so I'll choose a strategic starting word. A good opener should:
- Include common letters (especially vowels) to maximize information
- Avoid repeating letters
- Use frequent consonants like R, S, T

The word **""RAISE""** is ideal because:
- Contains 3 of the top 7 most common English letters (R, A, S)
- Uses two vowels (A and E) and three consonants
- No repeated letters
- High frequency letters increase the chance of getting valuable feedback (✓ or -)

This will help narrow down possibilities regardless of the secret word.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so the third letter is I)
- S: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so the fifth letter is E)

So, we know:
- The secret word has the letter I in the third position and E in the fifth position. So the word pattern is: _ _ I _ E
- The letter S is in the word but not in the fourth position (since it was in the fourth position in ""RAISE"" and got a '-', meaning it's present but misplaced). Also, note that S cannot be in the third or fifth because those are fixed as I and E, and we know S is not in the fourth. So S must be in either the first or second position.
- The letters R and A are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Has 'I' as the third letter and 'E' as the fifth letter.
- Includes the letter 'S' but not in the fourth position (and not in the third or fifth, so only first or second).
- Does not contain R or A.

Additionally, we should try to test other common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for S: first or second.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ _ I _ E and contain S, and avoid R and A.

We can also consider that we have two positions to fill (first and second) and one of them might be S, and the fourth position is open (but we know it's not S, and not R or A).

We need to guess a word that might help us identify the remaining letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, etc.

Let me try to list some words that fit the pattern:

- The word must be _ _ I _ E

Possibilities:
- If S is in the first position: S _ I _ E
  - Examples: SPINE, SHINE, SMITE, SUITE, etc. But note we cannot use R or A, so avoid those.

- If S is in the second position: _ S I _ E
  - Examples: ONSET (but ONSET has E in the fifth? O N S E T -> no, because the third letter is S, not I. We need third letter I and fifth E. So _ S I _ E: words like OSSIE (not common), but let's think: POSIE? Not a word. Maybe ""USINE"" (not English). 

Alternatively, we can think of words that have S and the pattern.

Another idea: since we know S is in the word but not in the fourth position, and we have to place it in first or second, we can try a word that puts S in the first position to test that.

But also, we need to cover other common letters.

Let me try to form a word:

Option 1: Put S in the first position: S _ I _ E
  - We need a letter for the second and fourth. The fourth cannot be S (already known) and not R or A. Also, we haven't tested many consonants.
  - Possible words: 
      - SHINE: H and N are new. But note, we have to check if it's valid. SHINE: S H I N E -> third is I, fifth is E. And S is in first, which is a new position. Also, no R or A.
      - SMITE: S M I T E -> T is new, and M is new.
      - SUITE: S U I T E -> U and T are new.

Option 2: Put S in the second position: _ S I _ E
  - Words: 
      - O S I E R -> but that has R, which is not allowed (we know R is absent). Also, it's 5 letters? O-S-I-E-R is 5, but we have E in fifth? O S I E R: positions: 1:O, 2:S, 3:I, 4:E, 5:R -> but we need fifth to be E, but here it's R. So not.
      - We need the fifth to be E. So pattern: _ S I _ E
      - Possible: USINE? Not a word. 
      - Maybe ""CISKE"" not a word. 
      - How about ""POSIT"" but that ends with T, not E. 
      - Actually, it's hard. Let me think: is there a word like ""ASSIE""? Not common and has A which is absent.

Perhaps putting S in the first position is easier.

We can also consider that the fourth position is open and we don't know what it is. We should try to test a common letter there.

But note: we have two positions to discover: first, second, and fourth. But we know one of the first two must be S? Actually, no: we know S is in the word, but it could be in the first or second position. But we don't know which. So we have to cover both possibilities.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S in the second position to test that, but we need a valid word.

After some thought, I found:
- For S in the second position: words like ""OSTIA"" but that has A and ends with A, not E. Not matching.
  Actually, I recall ""BASIC"" but that doesn't end with E.

Another idea: the word ""SPIRE"" but that has R which is absent. Not allowed.

Wait, let me use a word that doesn't necessarily have S in the first two, but we know S must be in the word so we have to include it. But we can put it in a different position? No, because the feedback said S is in the word but not in the fourth position, and the third and fifth are fixed, so it must be in first or second.

So we must put S in either first or second.

Given the difficulty of finding a word with S in the second position, I'll go with S in the first position.

So, pattern: S _ I _ E

We need to choose the second and fourth letters. We should choose common letters that we haven't tested.

We haven't tested: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

We can try:

- SHINE: S H I N E -> H in second, N in fourth. This tests H and N.
- SMITE: S M I T E -> M in second, T in fourth. Tests M and T.
- SUITE: S U I T E -> U in second, T in fourth. Tests U and T.

But note: in SUITE, the fourth letter is T and fifth is E, so it fits.

We also have to avoid letters we know are absent: R and A.

All of these avoid R and A.

Which one to choose? We want to maximize information. We can choose a word that has common letters.

SHINE: H and N are common.
SMITE: M and T are common.
SUITE: U and T (U is less common).

SHINE might be a good choice because it has two common consonants.

But note: we already know that the word has an I in third and E in fifth, and S somewhere. So by testing SHINE, we can check if H and N are present.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has a letter that might be in the fourth position.

But we don't have much to go on.

I think SHINE is a good candidate.

But let me check: is SHINE a valid word? Yes.

So, let's go with SHINE.

But wait: what if the secret word has S in the second position? Then by putting S in the first, we might get a '-' for S, which would tell us that S is not in the first, so it must be in the second. That's valuable information.

So, if we guess SHINE and S is in the first, then:
- If the secret word has S in the first, we get ✓ for S.
- If the secret word has S in the second, we get '-' for S (since it's present but in the wrong position).

Either way, we get information about S's position.

Similarly, we test H and N.

So, I think SHINE is a good guess.

But note: the feedback for the first guess said S is in the word but not in the fourth position. In SHINE, we are putting S in the first, which is a new position, so we can see if it's correct or not.

We are also putting H in the second and N in the fourth.

If the secret word has S in the second position, then in SHINE, S would get a '-' (because it's present but should be in second, not first). And H would be evaluated: if H is not in the word, it would be 'x', and if it is, it might be in the wrong position or right? But the second position in the secret word is unknown.

Similarly for N.

So, it's a good test.

Therefore, I'll guess ""SHINE"".

But let me see if there's a better word. Another common one is ""SLICE"", but that has L and C, and also we have to avoid A and R. But SLICE: S L I C E -> but the fourth letter is C. However, we know that the fourth position might be anything. But note, in the first guess, we had S in the fourth and it was wrong, but that doesn't prevent C from being there. However, SLICE has L and C, which are also common.

But SHINE seems equally good.

Alternatively, ""SPINE"": S P I N E -> tests P and N. But P is less common than H? Actually, H is more common.

I think SHINE is fine.

So, my next guess: SHINE

Format: <guess>SHINE</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- **R** and **A** are absent (x), so they can be excluded from future guesses.
- **I** is correct and in the right position (✓), so the third letter of the secret word is **I**.
- **S** is present but misplaced (-), meaning it must be in the secret word but not in the fourth position. Since the third and fifth positions are fixed as **I** and **E**, **S** must be in either the first or second position.
- **E** is correct and in the right position (✓), so the fifth letter is **E**.

This gives us the following pattern for the secret word: `_ _ I _ E`, with **S** in position 1 or 2, and no **R** or **A**.

For the second guess, I chose **SHINE** because:
- It fits the pattern `_ _ I _ E` (specifically, `S H I N E`).
- It tests **S** in the first position (to determine if **S** belongs there or in the second position).
- It introduces new common letters (**H** and **N**) to gather more information.
- It avoids excluded letters (**R** and **A**).

We are given feedback for two guesses:

From Guess 1 (RAISE):
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is I)
- S: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so the fifth letter is E)

From Guess 2 (SHINE):
- S: ✓ (correct position, so the first letter is S)
- H: x (not in the word)
- I: ✓ (we knew this already)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (we knew this already)

So, combining the information:
- The secret word starts with S (from SHINE's feedback), and has I as the third letter and E as the fifth.
- So the pattern is: S _ I _ E
- We know from Guess 1 that S is in the word but not in the fourth position; now we see it's in the first position, which matches.
- Letters that are absent: R, A, H.
- Additionally, N is in the word but not in the fourth position (since in SHINE, N was in the fourth position and got a '-', meaning it's present but not there).

Now, the secret word is S _ I _ E, and we know:
- The second and fourth positions are unknown.
- N must be in the word, but not in the fourth position. Since the positions available are second and fourth, but fourth is wrong for N, so N must be in the second position? Not necessarily, because it could be in the fourth? No, the feedback says N is in the word but not in the fourth position. Since the word is only five letters, and we have:
  Position 1: S (fixed)
  Position 2: unknown
  Position 3: I (fixed)
  Position 4: unknown
  Position 5: E (fixed)

So N must appear in one of these positions, but not in position 4 (because it got a '-'). But position 1,3,5 are fixed and not N? 
Position 1 is S (so not N), position 3 is I (not N), position 5 is E (not N). So the only possibilities for N are position 2 or position 4. But we have feedback that it's not in position 4, so it must be in position 2.

Therefore, the second letter must be N.

Is that right? Let me confirm:

- The N in SHINE was in the fourth position and got a '-', meaning N is in the secret word but not in the fourth position.
- Since the secret word has positions: 1=S, 2=?, 3=I, 4=?, 5=E.
- The only place where N can be is position 2, because position 1,3,5 are taken, and position 4 is excluded.

Therefore, the secret word must have N in the second position.

So now we have: S N I _ E

We also know that the fourth position is missing and must be a letter that is not R, A, H (from previous exclusions). And we have no other known letters.

Now, we need to guess a word that has the pattern: S N I _ E

The fourth position must be a letter that makes a valid English word.

Possible common letters: we want to test letters that are frequent and haven't been excluded.

Excluded letters so far: R, A, H.

We haven't tested: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we must make a valid word.

Words that fit S N I _ E:

Common possibilities:
- SNIPE: fourth letter P. This would be S N I P E. P is a new letter.
- SNIDE: fourth letter D. S N I D E. D is new.
- SNIKE: not common, usually ""snake"" but has A which is excluded. Invalid.
- SNITE: not a common word.
- SNIEE? Not a word.

More common ones: SNIPE and SNIDE.

But we need to choose one. We can also consider that we don't know what the fourth letter is, so we can pick one arbitrarily to test.

But note: we are guessing the word, and if we guess SNIPE or SNIDE, it might be correct.

Alternatively, we could use a word that has a different letter to test, but the pattern requires S, N, I, then a letter, then E.

So let's list possible words:

- SNIPE (meaning to shoot at someone from hiding)
- SNIDE (disparaging or mocking)
- SNIKE (not standard, avoid)
- SNAKE? Has A which is excluded, and second letter would be N? S N A K E? But A is absent, so no.
- SNORE? Has R which is absent, and O instead of I? Not matching pattern.

So the main options are SNIPE and SNIDE.

We can use either. But either way, we are verifying the fourth letter.

If we guess SNIPE, and it's wrong, then we know that P is not the fourth letter, and we also learn that P is either absent or present. Similarly for SNIDE.

So we might need to use our next guesses wisely.

But we have 6 tries total, and this is the third guess. We can afford to make a guess that tests the letter.

However, note that we are confirming two things: the word has N in the second position (which we deduced) and we are filling the fourth letter.

I think SNIPE is a common word, so I'll go with that.

But let me see: if we guess SNIPE, and if the secret word is SNIDE, we would get:
- S ✓ (correct and position)
- N ✓ (we guessed second position) -> but wait, we also deduced that N should be in second position. So if we guess SNIPE, the N would be in second position? Let me write SNIPE: position1=S,2=N,3=I,4=P,5=E.

We expect that the secret word has N in second? Yes, based on our deduction. But we are not 100% sure? Actually, let's verify the deduction:

The feedback for SHINE: N was in position four and got a '-', meaning N is in the word but not in that position. Since the secret word has only positions 2 and 4 available for N (because 1,3,5 are fixed with S,I,E respectively). Position 4 is where it was guessed and is wrong, so N must be in position 2. So we are sure that N is in position 2.

Therefore, in our guess, we should put N in position 2.

So, the guess should have S, then N, then I, then some letter, then E.

So, we can choose SNIPE to test P.

Alternatively, SNIDE to test D.

But which one to pick? We should pick one and see. If we are wrong, we'll learn about the letter.

But to be cautious, let's think: are there other possibilities?

What if the word has two N's? But in the feedback from SHINE: we had only one N, and it was marked, so the secret word might have only one N. But it's possible to have two N's? For example, if the secret word had N in second and also in fourth, then when we guessed SHINE (which had N only in fourth), it should have shown a '-' for N (for position four) regardless, and it doesn't indicate if there are multiple. So it could be that the secret word has N in second and another N in fourth? But no, because in that case, when we guessed SHINE with N in fourth, it would be correct? No, wait: the feedback per letter doesn't account for duplicates explicitly. Actually, Wordle rules: if a letter appears multiple times, it might be handled specially. But in the rules described:

Each letter is marked:

For the secret word BRISK, guess STORM: S is in the word but wrong position? But STORM has S, and BRISK has S? Actually, BRISK has S? No, BRISK: B,R,I,S,K. So S is at position four. Guess STORM: S,T,O,R,M. S is at position one, so it should show S as '-' (present) because S is in the secret word but not in position one. Yes.

Similarly, if a letter appears twice, it's complicated.

For example, if secret word has two S's, and guess has two S's, one in correct position and one in wrong, then the correct position gets ✓, and the wrong one might get '-' or 'x' depending? But in the rules, it's a bit ambiguous.

But in our case, we have no indication there are two N's. Moreover, the feedback for SHINE: we had one N, and it got a '-', meaning at least one N is present but not in position four. And absent for others. So it could have two N's? But let's see: if the secret word had two N's, one in position two and one in position four, then when we guess SHINE (with N in position four), we would see:
- For N: it should be marked ✓ if position four is correct? No, but position four should be N in that case? So if the secret word has N in position four, then in SHINE, N is in position four, it should be ✓. But we got a '-', which means that position four is not N, so the secret word cannot have N in position four. Therefore, the extra N (if any) can only be in position two.

But the secret word might have only one N, which must be in position two.

Therefore, we are safe to assume that the second letter is N.

So the word is S N I _ E.

We need to find a letter for the fourth position.

Possible letters: as above.

We can choose SNIPE.

But is SNIPE valid? Yes.

However, we haven't tested P at all, so if we get it wrong, we won't know about P? But our goal is to solve the word, so we should guess a word that might be the answer.

Alternatively, if we think there are multiple possibilities, we could guess a word that covers more information? But in this case, we are almost sure: the fourth letter must be a letter that completes the word. There aren't many possibilities: SNIPE, SNIDE are the main ones. Others like SNIKE (not common), SNITE (archaic), SNOWY? No, third letter O? Doesn't match.

So likely between SNIPE and SNIDE.

We can guess SNIPE first.

But we are not forced to, but we have limited guesses.

Since we have three guesses left (if this is wrong), we can still try again.

But perhaps SNIPE is a good guess.

I'll go with SNIPE.

Another common one is ""SHIRE"" but that has H (absent) and R (absent), and doesn't match pattern.

No, SHIRE is S H I R E, but H is absent and R is absent, so invalid.

So, <guess>SNIPE</guess>
</think>
The feedback from previous guesses reveals the following:
1. **RAISE**: 
   - R and A are absent (x), so they can be excluded.
   - I (3rd position) and E (5th position) are correct (✓), fixing these positions.
   - S is present but misplaced (-), indicating it must be in the word but not in the 4th position.
2. **SHINE**:
   - S is correct in the 1st position (✓), confirming the pattern of the word as `S _ I _ E`.
   - H is absent (x), so it can be excluded.
   - I is correct (already known) and E is correct (already known).
   - N is present but misplaced in the 4th position (-), meaning N is in the word but not in the 4th position.

Combining the constraints:
- The secret word pattern is `S _ I _ E`.
- The second position must be N because:
  - N is present (from SHINE's feedback).
  - The only possible positions for N are the second or fourth (since positions 1, 3, and 5 are fixed as S, I, and E).
  - N cannot be in the fourth position (SHINE's feedback shows it as misplaced there).
- Thus, the secret word is confirmed to have N in the second position, resulting in the pattern `S N I _ E`.
- Excluded letters: R, A, H.
- Remaining unknown: Only the fourth position needs to be guessed. Possible candidates include P (for SNIPE) or D (for SNIDE), but other letters could work if valid.

**Strategy for this guess**:
- The goal is to test the fourth position with a valid word.
- **SNIPE** is chosen because:
  - It fits the pattern `S N I P E`.
  - It tests P in the fourth position, providing feedback on whether it is correct or not.
  - If incorrect, the feedback will reveal whether P is absent or present elsewhere (narrowing future guesses).
- SNIPE is a common 5-letter word, satisfying the game rules.

If SNIPE is wrong, future guesses can test alternatives like SNIDE or other valid words with the pattern `S N I _ E` and untested letters.

<guess>SNIPE</guess>",SNIPE,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

From Guess 1 (RAISE):
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is I)
- S: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so the fifth letter is E)

From Guess 2 (SHINE):
- S: ✓ (correct position, so the first letter is S)
- H: x (not in the word)
- I: ✓ (we knew this already)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (we knew this already)

So, combining the information:
- The secret word starts with S (from SHINE's feedback), and has I as the third letter and E as the fifth.
- So the pattern is: S _ I _ E
- We know from Guess 1 that S is in the word but not in the fourth position; now we see it's in the first position, which matches.
- Letters that are absent: R, A, H.
- Additionally, N is in the word but not in the fourth position (since in SHINE, N was in the fourth position and got a '-', meaning it's present but not there).

Now, the secret word is S _ I _ E, and we know:
- The second and fourth positions are unknown.
- N must be in the word, but not in the fourth position. Since the positions available are second and fourth, but fourth is wrong for N, so N must be in the second position? Not necessarily, because it could be in the fourth? No, the feedback says N is in the word but not in the fourth position. Since the word is only five letters, and we have:
  Position 1: S (fixed)
  Position 2: unknown
  Position 3: I (fixed)
  Position 4: unknown
  Position 5: E (fixed)

So N must appear in one of these positions, but not in position 4 (because it got a '-'). But position 1,3,5 are fixed and not N? 
Position 1 is S (so not N), position 3 is I (not N), position 5 is E (not N). So the only possibilities for N are position 2 or position 4. But we have feedback that it's not in position 4, so it must be in position 2.

Therefore, the second letter must be N.

Is that right? Let me confirm:

- The N in SHINE was in the fourth position and got a '-', meaning N is in the secret word but not in the fourth position.
- Since the secret word has positions: 1=S, 2=?, 3=I, 4=?, 5=E.
- The only place where N can be is position 2, because position 1,3,5 are taken, and position 4 is excluded.

Therefore, the secret word must have N in the second position.

So now we have: S N I _ E

We also know that the fourth position is missing and must be a letter that is not R, A, H (from previous exclusions). And we have no other known letters.

Now, we need to guess a word that has the pattern: S N I _ E

The fourth position must be a letter that makes a valid English word.

Common possibilities:
- SNIPE: fourth letter P. This would be S N I P E. P is a new letter.
- SNIDE: fourth letter D. S N I D E. D is new.
- SNIKE: not common, usually ""snake"" but has A which is excluded. Invalid.

- SNIEE? Not a word.

More common ones: SNIPE and SNIDE.

But we need to choose one. We can also consider that we don't know what the fourth letter is, so we can pick one arbitrarily to test.

Therefore, in our guess, we should put N in position 2.
