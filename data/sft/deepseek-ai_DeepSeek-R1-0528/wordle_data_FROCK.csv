We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: (-) meaning C is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R: (✓) meaning R is in the word and in the correct position (so the second letter of the secret word is R).
- A: (x) meaning A is not in the word.
- N: (x) meaning N is not in the word.
- E: (x) meaning E is not in the word.

So, we know:
- The second letter is R (position 2).
- The letter C is in the word, but not in the first position (since we had it in the first position and it was marked wrong position).
- The secret word does not contain A, N, or E.

We also know the secret word is 5 letters.

Let's think about possible positions for C. Since it's not in position 1, and position 2 is R, C must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Has R in the second position (because we know that's correct and we can use that to test other letters).
- Does not use the letters A, N, E (since they are absent).
- Includes the letter C in a position that is not 1 or 2 (so positions 3,4,5) but note that we don't know which one yet.

Also, we should try to include other common letters that we haven't tried yet to get more information.

Common letters in English 5-letter words (besides the ones we've tried) might include: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, etc.

We have to avoid A, N, E.

Let's try to form a word that has:
- Second letter R.
- The letter C in position 3, 4, or 5? But we don't know, so we can put it in one of those and see.
- Also, we should include other new letters to test.

Possible words:

Option 1: Put C in position 3? Then the word would be _ R C _ _

But we don't know the other letters. We need a valid word.

Let me think of words that have R as the second letter and contain C, and without A, N, E.

For example: ""TRUCK"" -> but that has T, R, U, C, K. However, we don't know if T, U, or K are in the word. Also, note that in ""crane"", the C was in position 1 and now we are moving it to position 4? Let's see:

In ""TRUCK"":
- T is first, R second, U third, C fourth, K fifth.

But we know that the secret word has C, but not in position 1. So if we put C in position 4, that might be a good test.

However, we also have to consider that the feedback for C in the first guess was that it is present but in the wrong position. So in the secret word, C is at position 3,4, or 5.

We can try to test C in position 3, 4, and 5? But we can only test one at a time.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has C in a different position and also tests other common letters.

Another idea: since we know R is fixed in position 2, we can try to use words that have R in the middle and test other vowels? But we know A and E are out, so vowels left: I, O, U.

Let me list some words that fit:
- ""CRISP"": but C is in position 1 again? We know C is not in position 1, so we shouldn't put C in position 1. Also, we have to avoid A, N, E. ""CRISP"" has C in position 1, which we know is wrong, so that would be a waste because we already know C isn't in position 1.

We need a word that has R in position 2 and C in position 3,4, or 5.

Examples:
- Position 3: ""ORCIN"" -> not a common word? Also, we don't know if O is in the word.
- Position 4: ""FORCE"" -> but E is out, so we can't use E.
- Position 5: ""SCURF"" -> S, C, U, R, F? But R is in position 4? We need R in position 2.

Wait, we need R in position 2. So the word must be: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

And we want to include C in one of positions 3,4,5.

Also, no A, N, E.

Let me think of words that start with a consonant, then R, then ... and include C.

Possible words:
- ""TRICE"": but E is out -> invalid because of E.
- ""PRICK"": P, R, I, C, K -> this seems valid. Letters: P, R, I, C, K. No A, N, E.
- ""BRICK"": B, R, I, C, K -> also valid.

Both ""PRICK"" and ""BRICK"" are valid.

But note: in the first guess, we had C in position 1 and it was wrong position. Now if we put C in position 4 (in ""BRICK"" or ""PRICK""), that would be a new position.

We can also consider other words that have C in position 5? Like ""CURRY"" but that has two R's and we don't know about duplicates. Also, C is in position 1 again? No, we are avoiding position 1 for C.

Another word: ""SCREW"" -> but that has S, C, R, E, W -> E is out, so invalid.

""SCRUM"" -> S, C, R, U, M -> but R is in position 3? We need R in position 2. So the structure must be: [not C] R ... and then C in 3,4,5.

So for ""SCRUM"", the first letter is S, then C? That would be S C R ... -> so R is in position 3, not 2. So that doesn't have R in position 2.

We need the word to be of the form: [letter] R [letter] [letter] [letter]

So let's try to list:

- ""DRUMS"" -> D R U M S -> no C, but we need to test C? Actually, we don't have to test C in this guess? We can test other letters and leave C for later? But we know C is in the word, so we should try to find its position.

Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't have C but tests other letters? But that might not be efficient because we know C is in the word and we need to find where.

So I think it's better to include C in the guess to test its position.

Therefore, let's choose a word that has R in position 2 and C in one of 3,4,5.

Options:
- Position 3: ""TRICK"" -> T R I C K -> valid. But note: we have T and I and K to test.
- Position 4: ""BROCK"" -> B R O C K -> valid? Brock is a name, but also a word? We need a common word. Alternatively, ""CROCK"" has C at position 1? No, C R O C K -> C is at 1 and 4? We know C is not at 1, so we can't use C at position 1. So ""CROCK"" is invalid because it has C at position 1? But we are allowed to use words that have C at position 1? The feedback will tell us it's wrong position again, but we already know that. However, it might be better to avoid position 1 for C to test a new position.

But in ""CROCK"", we have C at position 1 and 4. We know position 1 is wrong, but position 4 might be correct? However, we are not sure. Also, we are using a duplicate C? The secret word might have only one C? We don't know.

To avoid confusion, let's choose a word without duplicate letters and without C in position 1.

So ""TRICK"" and ""BRICK"" are good.

""PRICK"" is also good.

I'll choose ""BRICK"": 
- B in position 1: we don't know if B is in the word.
- R in position 2: correct (we know that, so it will be ✓)
- I in position 3: test if I is in the word and in that position.
- C in position 4: test if C is in position 4 (if it is, we get ✓, if not, we might get - or x)
- K in position 5: test K.

This guess will give us information about B, I, C, and K.

Also, note that we are not using any of the forbidden letters (A, N, E).

So let's go with ""BRICK"".

But wait, we have to consider: what if the secret word has C in position 3? Then in ""BRICK"", C is in position 4, which would be wrong position? But we would get feedback that C is present but wrong position? Then we would know it's not in position 4, but we still don't know if it's in 3 or 5.

Alternatively, if we put C in position 3, we might get it correct if it is in 3.

But we don't know, so we have to choose one.

I think ""BRICK"" is a reasonable guess.

Another option: ""CRWTH"" is not common.

So I'll go with ""BRICK"".

But note: we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""brick"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next guess is ""BRICK"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (marked as -).
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, marked as ✓).
- A, N, and E are not in the word (marked as x).

Key insights:
- The secret word has R as the second letter.
- C is present but must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (since it's not in position 1, and position 2 is R).
- Avoid using A, N, or E in the new guess.

For the next guess:
- I chose ""BRICK"" because:
  - It has R in position 2 (to confirm and maintain the known correct position).
  - It places C in position 4 (to test if C is in position 4; if not, the feedback will help narrow down C's position to 3 or 5).
  - It introduces new common letters (B, I, K) to test for presence/absence and positions.
  - It avoids the excluded letters (A, N, E) and uses distinct letters to maximize information.

This guess should provide valuable feedback on the positions of C and the presence of B, I, and K.

- The secret word does not contain A, N, or E.

We also know the secret word is 5 letters.

Let's think about possible positions for C. Since it's not in position 1, and position 2 is R, C must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Has R in the second position (because we know that's correct and we can use that to test other letters).
- Does not use the letters A, N, E (since they are absent).
- Includes the letter C in a position that is not 1 or 2 (so positions 3,4,5) but note that we don't know which one yet.

Also, we should try to include other common letters that we haven't tried yet to get more information.

Common letters in English 5-letter words (besides the ones we've tried) might include: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, etc.

We have to avoid A, N, E.

Let's try to form a word that has:
- Second letter R.
- The letter C in position 3, 4, or 5? But we don't know, so we can put it in one of those and see.
- Also, we should include other new letters to test.

Possible words:

Option 1: Put C in position 3? Then the word would be _ R C _ _

But we don't know the other letters. We need a valid word.

Let me think of words that have R as the second letter and contain C, and without A, N, E.

For example: ""TRUCK"" -> but that has T, R, U, C, K. However, we don't know if T, U, or K are in the word. Also, note that in ""crane"", the C was in position 1 and now we are moving it to position 4? Let's see:

In ""TRUCK"":
- T is first, R second, U third, C fourth, K fifth.

But we know that the secret word has C, but not in position 1. So if we put C in position 4, that might be a good test.

However, we also have to consider that the feedback for C in the first guess was that it is present but in the wrong position. So in the secret word, C is at position 3,4, or 5.

We can try to test C in position 3, 4, and 5? But we can only test one at a time.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has C in a different position and also tests other common letters.

Another idea: since we know R is fixed in position 2, we can try to use words that have R in the middle and test other vowels? But we know A and E are out, so vowels left: I, O, U.

Let me list some words that fit:
- ""CRISP"": but C is in position 1 again? We know C is not in position 1, so we shouldn't put C in position 1. Also, we have to avoid A, N, E. ""CRISP"" has C in position 1, which we know is wrong, so that would be a waste because we already know C isn't in position 1.

We need a word that has R in position 2 and C in position 3,4, or 5.

Examples:
- Position 3: ""ORCIN"" -> not a common word? Also, we don't know if O is in the word.
- Position 4: ""FORCE"" -> but E is out, so we can't use E.
- Position 5: ""SCURF"" -> S, C, U, R, F? But R is in position 4? We need R in position 2.

Wait, we need R in position 2. So the word must be: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

And we want to include C in one of positions 3,4,5.

Also, no A, N, E.

Let me think of words that start with a consonant, then R, then ... and include C.

Possible words:
- ""TRICE"": but E is out -> invalid because of E.
- ""PRICK"": P, R, I, C, K -> this seems valid. Letters: P, R, I, C, K. No A, N, E.
- ""BRICK"": B, R, I, C, K -> also valid.

Both ""PRICK"" and ""BRICK"" are valid.

But note: in the first guess, we had C in position 1 and it was wrong position. Now if we put C in position 4 (in ""BRICK"" or ""PRICK""), that would be a new position.

We can also consider other words that have C in position 5? Like ""CURRY"" but that has two R's and we don't know about duplicates. Also, C is in position 1 again? No, we are avoiding position 1 for C.

Another word: ""SCREW"" -> but that has S, C, R, E, W -> E is out, so invalid.

""SCRUM"" -> S, C, R, U, M -> but R is in position 3? We need R in position 2. So the structure must be: [not C] R ... and then C in 3,4,5.

So for ""SCRUM"", the first letter is S, then C? That would be S C R ... -> so R is in position 3, not 2. So that doesn't have R in position 2.

We need the word to be of the form: [letter] R [letter] [letter] [letter]

So let's try to list:

- ""DRUMS"" -> D R U M S -> no C, but we need to test C? Actually, we don't have to test C in this guess? We can test other letters and leave C for later? But we know C is in the word, so we should try to find its position.

Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't have C but tests other letters? But that might not be efficient because we know C is in the word and we need to find where.

So I think it's better to include C in the guess to test its position.

Therefore, let's choose a word that has R in position 2 and C in one of 3,4,5.

Options:
- Position 3: ""TRICK"" -> T R I C K -> valid. But note: we have T and I and K to test.
- Position 4: ""BROCK"" -> B R O C K -> valid? Brock is a name, but also a word? We need a common word. Alternatively, ""CROCK"" has C at position 1? No, C R O C K -> C is at 1 and 4? We know C is not at 1, so we can't use C at position 1. So ""CROCK"" is invalid because it has C at position 1? But we are allowed to use words that have C at position 1? The feedback will tell us it's wrong position again, but we already know that. However, it might be better to avoid position 1 for C to test a new position.

But in ""CROCK"", we have C at position 1 and 4. We know position 1 is wrong, but position 4 might be correct? However, we are not sure. Also, we are using a duplicate C? The secret word might have only one C? We don't know.

To avoid confusion, let's choose a word without duplicate letters and without C in position 1.

So ""TRICK"" and ""BRICK"" are good.

""PRICK"" is also good.

I'll choose ""BRICK"": 
- B in position 1: we don't know if B is in the word.
- R in position 2: correct (we know that, so it will be ✓)
- I in position 3: test if I is in the word and in that position.
- C in position 4: test if C is in position 4 (if it is, we get ✓, if not, we might get - or x)
- K in position 5: test K.

This guess will give us information about B, I, C, and K.

Also, note that we are not using any of the forbidden letters (A, N, E).

So let's go with ""BRICK"".

But wait, we have to consider: what if the secret word has C in position 3? Then in ""BRICK"", C is in position 4, which would be wrong position? But we would get feedback that C is present but wrong position? Then we would know it's not in position 4, but we still don't know if it's in 3 or 5.

Alternatively, if we put C in position 3, we might get it correct if it is in 3.

But we don't know, so we have to choose one.

I think ""BRICK"" is a reasonable guess.

Another option: ""CRWTH"" is not common.

So I'll go with ""BRICK"".

But note: we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""brick"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next guess is ""BRICK"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (marked as -).
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, marked as ✓).
- A, N, and E are not in the word (marked as x).

Key insights:
- The secret word has R as the second letter.
- C is present but must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (since it's not in position 1, and position 2 is R).
- Avoid using A, N, or E in the new guess.

For the next guess:
- I chose ""BRICK"" because:
  - It has R in position 2 (to confirm and maintain the known correct position).
  - It places C in position 4 (to test if C is in position 4; if not, the feedback will help narrow down C's position to 3 or 5).
  - It introduces new common letters (B, I, K) to test for presence/absence and positions.
  - It avoids the excluded letters (A, N, E) and uses distinct letters to maximize information.

This guess should provide valuable feedback on the positions of C and the presence of B, I, and K.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: present but wrong position (so C is in the word, not at position 1)
- R: correct position (so the second letter is R)
- A: absent
- N: absent
- E: absent

Guess 2: ""brick""
- B: absent (so B is not in the word)
- R: correct position (as we already knew, so second letter is R)
- I: absent (so I is not in the word)
- C: correct position (so C is at position 4)
- K: correct position (so K is at position 5)

Therefore, we now know:
- The secret word has the second letter R, fourth letter C, and fifth letter K. So the word is _ R _ C K.
- The first letter is unknown, and the third letter is unknown.
- We know that A, N, E, B, and I are absent.

Also, from the first guess, we know C is present and not in position 1, which is consistent with it being in position 4.

Now, we need to find a word that fits the pattern: [letter1] R [letter3] C K

We must avoid the letters: A, N, E, B, I.

We need to guess a word that has this pattern and uses letters that are possible.

Common letters that haven't been tested yet: S, T, L, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, etc.

We can try to think of words that match _ R _ C K.

Possible words:
- TRUCK: but E is absent (from guess1) and U hasn't been tested? But in TRUCK, we have T, R, U, C, K. However, we know E is absent, but U is new. But note: in TRUCK, the third letter is U. However, we must check if U is allowed? We haven't ruled out U. But wait, in the pattern, the third letter is unknown. However, TRUCK has C in position 4 and K in position 5, which matches. But we must avoid E, which is not in TRUCK, so it's okay. However, we have to see if it's valid.

But let's list possible words:

- TRUCK: T R U C K -> but we don't know about T and U.
- TRACK: but A is absent, so invalid.
- TRICK: but I is absent, so invalid.
- BRICK: B is absent, so invalid.
- FRECK: not a word.
- WRACK: A absent.
- WRICK: not common? Or is it? Wrick is a word? Maybe, but let's see.
- PRICK: P R I C K -> but I is absent, so invalid.
- CROCK: C is at position 1? But we know C is at position 4, and in CROCK, C is at 1 and 4? But we know position 1 is not C (from first guess feedback). Also, we are avoiding duplicate testing? But the pattern is _ R _ C K, so first letter cannot be C? Because if it were C, then in the first guess, when we had C at position 1, it would have been marked as correct? But it was marked as wrong position, so position 1 is not C. Therefore, CROCK would have C at position 1 which is incorrect, so it's not the word. Also, we are avoiding C at position 1.

Back to possible words: _ R _ C K

We need a 5-letter word with second letter R, fourth letter C, fifth letter K, and without A, N, E, B, I.

Let me think of common words:
- TRUCK: T R U C K -> T and U are unknown and not excluded.
- DROCK: not a common word? Drock is not standard.
- FROCK: F R O C K -> O is unknown. Frock is a word (a type of garment).
- PROCK: not a word.
- GROCK: not a word.
- CROCK: but first letter C is invalid as per pattern? Pattern first letter must not be C, and also we know it's not C. So CROCK is invalid because of first letter C.

So the main candidates are TRUCK and FROCK.

But we have to choose one for the guess.

We can also consider WRACK, but A is absent, so no.

Another one: TRUCK and FROCK are the most common.

We can also think of ""wrack"" but A is out.

""PRICK"" has I, which is out.

""BRICK"" has B, which is out.

So between TRUCK and FROCK, which one to choose?

We can choose TRUCK because it has U, which is a vowel we haven't tested, and T is a common consonant.

But note: we are not just testing, we are trying to guess the word. Since we have three positions known (R, C, K) and only two unknown, we can try to guess.

But we have two possibilities? Actually, there might be more.

Another word: ""CRAKE"" but A and E are out.

""CRUCK"" not a word.

""DRACK"" not common.

So let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and avoid the excluded letters.

Excluded letters: A, N, E, B, I.

Possible letters for first position: any letter except A, N, E, B, I, and also not C (since we know position 1 is not C from first guess). So available: D, F, G, H, J, K (but K is at the end, so not first? no, K can be first? but we have K at the end, but it could be in the word twice? We don't know. The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates. In the first guess, we had no duplicates, and in the second, we had no duplicates. But the secret word might have duplicates? We don't know.

In the pattern, we have K at position 5. If the first letter is K, then K would be in the word twice? But that's possible. However, in the second guess, we had K at position 5 and it was correct, but if the word has two K's, we wouldn't know from that. But in the feedback for ""brick"", K was marked correct at position 5, but if there were another K, we wouldn't have information about it.

But for now, let's not assume duplicates. We'll consider the possibility.

So for first position: letters not excluded: C (but we know not position 1), A, N, E, B, I are excluded. So available: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want common letters.

For third position: same available letters, but must form a word.

Words:
- TRUCK: T R U C K -> T and U are not excluded.
- FROCK: F R O C K -> F and O not excluded.
- WRACK: W R A C K -> A excluded, invalid.
- PRICK: P R I C K -> I excluded, invalid.
- BRICK: B excluded, invalid.
- CROCK: C at position 1, which we know is not correct, so invalid.
- DROCK: not a valid English word? I think not.
- GROCK: not a word.
- PROCK: not a word.
- TRUNK: but N is excluded? N is absent, so TRUNK has N? T R U N K -> N is in position 4? But we need C in position 4, so TRUNK has N at 4, not C. So invalid.
- Other words: ""FRISK"" but I is excluded and S is at position 4? We need C at position 4, so FRISK has S at 4, not C. Invalid.

So only TRUCK and FROCK seem common.

But what about ""CRUCK""? Not a word.

""THICK"": but H and I? I is excluded, and position 4 is C? THICK is T H I C K -> I is excluded, and position 3 is I? But we need position 4 to be C, which it is, but I is absent, so invalid.

""SHUCK"": S H U C K -> this is a word (meaning to remove the shell). S, H, U, C, K. Now, S and H and U are not excluded. And the pattern: first letter S, second R? But in SHUCK, second letter is H, not R. So it doesn't match the pattern. We need second letter R.

The pattern is fixed: position 2 is R, position 4 is C, position 5 is K.

So SHUCK has position 2 as H, not R. So no.

Similarly, ""STUCK"": S T U C K -> position 2 is T, not R. No.

So back to TRUCK and FROCK.

Another one: ""CROOK"": but C at position 1, which is invalid, and also O at position 3? C R O O K -> but position 1 is C, which we know is wrong, and also we need position 4 to be C? But in CROOK, position 4 is O, not C. So invalid.

""BROOK"": B is excluded, and position 4 is O, not C. Invalid.

So I think TRUCK and FROCK are the main options.

Now, we have to choose one. We can also consider less common words, but let's stick to common ones.

Another possibility: ""WRECK"": but E is excluded, and position 4 is C? W R E C K -> E is at position 3, which is excluded, so invalid.

""TRECK"" not a word.

So between TRUCK and FROCK, which one to guess?

We can look at which one uses more untested letters? But we don't have many guesses left, and we have two unknowns.

We can guess TRUCK because it has U, which is a vowel, and we haven't tested U or T.

FROCK has F and O.

But we are not testing for presence, we are trying to get the word.

Since we have two possibilities, we might need to choose one.

But note: there might be more words? Let me think.

""PRUCK"" not a word.

""DRACK"" not word.

""FRACK"": F R A C K -> but A is excluded, invalid.

So only two: TRUCK and FROCK.

But what about ""CROAK"": A excluded and C at position 1.

No.

""GROCK"" not word.

So I think TRUCK and FROCK are the only common ones.

But let's confirm: is there a word like ""TRICK""? No, I excluded.

Another one: ""WROKE"" not word.

So we'll choose one.

I'll go with TRUCK because it's a very common word.

So the guess is ""TRUCK"".

But note: in TRUCK, the third letter is U. We don't know if U is in the word.

If we guess TRUCK and it's not the word, we get feedback that tells us about T and U.

But since we have only two unknowns, we can solve it in the next guess if this is wrong.

Similarly for FROCK.

But let's choose TRUCK.

So the next guess is ""TRUCK"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C is present but not in position 1 (-), R is correct (✓), A, N, E are absent (x).
- **Guess 2: ""brick""** → B is absent (x), R is correct (✓), I is absent (x), C is correct (✓), K is correct (✓).

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the following fixed positions:
  - Position 2: R (confirmed correct in both guesses).
  - Position 4: C (confirmed correct in ""brick"").
  - Position 5: K (confirmed correct in ""brick"").
- The word pattern is: `_ R _ C K` (first and third letters are unknown).
- Absent letters: A, N, E (from Guess 1), B and I (from Guess 2). These cannot appear in the word.
- C cannot be in position 1 (as per Guess 1 feedback), which is consistent with the pattern.
- Possible words fitting `_ R _ C K` and avoiding absent letters include ""TRUCK"" and ""FROCK"". ""TRUCK"" is chosen to test new common letters (T and U) and because it is a high-frequency word.

### Next Guess: ""TRUCK""
- This tests:
  - T in position 1 (unknown).
  - U in position 3 (unknown).
- If correct, it solves the puzzle. If not, feedback on T and U will narrow down the possibilities (e.g., if U is absent, ""FROCK"" becomes the likely candidate).

<guess>truck</guess>",truck,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: present but wrong position (so C is in the word, not at position 1)
- R: correct position (so the second letter is R)
- A: absent
- N: absent
- E: absent

Guess 2: ""brick""
- B: absent (so B is not in the word)
- R: correct position (as we already knew, so second letter is R)
- I: absent (so I is not in the word)
- C: correct position (so C is at position 4)
- K: correct position (so K is at position 5)

Therefore, we now know:
- The secret word has the second letter R, fourth letter C, and fifth letter K. So the word is _ R _ C K.
- The first letter is unknown, and the third letter is unknown.
- We know that A, N, E, B, and I are absent.

Also, from the first guess, we know C is present and not in position 1, which is consistent with it being in position 4.

Now, we need to find a word that fits the pattern: [letter1] R [letter3] C K

We must avoid the letters: A, N, E, B, I.

We need to guess a word that has this pattern and uses letters that are possible.

Common letters that haven't been tested yet: S, T, L, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, etc.

We can try to think of words that match _ R _ C K.

Possible words:
- TRUCK: but E is absent (from guess1) and U hasn't been tested? But in TRUCK, we have T, R, U, C, K. However, we know E is absent, but U is new. But note: in TRUCK, the third letter is U. However, we must check if U is allowed? We haven't ruled out U. But wait, in the pattern, the third letter is unknown. However, TRUCK has C in position 4 and K in position 5, which matches. But we must avoid E, which is not in TRUCK, so it's okay. However, we have to see if it's valid.

But let's list possible words:

- TRUCK: T R U C K -> but we don't know about T and U.
- TRACK: but A is absent, so invalid.
- TRICK: but I is absent, so invalid.
- BRICK: B is absent, so invalid.
- FRECK: not a word.
- WRACK: A absent.
- WRICK: not common? Or is it? Wrick is a word? Maybe, but let's see.
- PRICK: P R I C K -> but I is absent, so invalid.
- CROCK: C is at position 1? But we know C is at position 4, and in CROCK, C is at 1 and 4? But we know position 1 is not C (from first guess feedback). Also, we are avoiding duplicate testing? But the pattern is _ R _ C K, so first letter cannot be C? Because if it were C, then in the first guess, when we had C at position 1, it would have been marked as correct? But it was marked as wrong position, so position 1 is not C. Therefore, CROCK would have C at position 1 which is incorrect, so it's not the word. Also, we are avoiding C at position 1.

Back to possible words: _ R _ C K

We need a 5-letter word with second letter R, fourth letter C, fifth letter K, and without A, N, E, B, I.

Let me think of common words:
- TRUCK: T R U C K -> T and U are unknown and not excluded.
- DROCK: not a common word? Drock is not standard.
- FROCK: F R O C K -> O is unknown. Frock is a word (a type of garment).
- PROCK: not a word.
- GROCK: not a word.
- CROCK: but first letter C is invalid as per pattern? Pattern first letter must not be C, and also we know it's not C. So CROCK is invalid because of first letter C.

So the main candidates are TRUCK and FROCK.

But we have to choose one for the guess.

We can also consider WRACK, but A is absent, so no.

Another one: TRUCK and FROCK are the most common.

We can also think of ""wrack"" but A is out.

""PRICK"" has I, which is out.

""BRICK"" has B, which is out.

So between TRUCK and FROCK, which one to choose?

We can choose TRUCK because it has U, which is a vowel we haven't tested, and T is a common consonant.

But note: we are not just testing, we are trying to guess the word. Since we have three positions known (R, C, K) and only two unknown, we can try to guess.

But we have two possibilities? Actually, there might be more.

Another word: ""CRAKE"" but A and E are out.

""CRUCK"" not a word.

""DRACK"" not common.

So let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and avoid the excluded letters.

Excluded letters: A, N, E, B, I.

Possible letters for first position: any letter except A, N, E, B, I, and also not C (since we know position 1 is not C from first guess). So available: D, F, G, H, J, K (but K is at the end, so not first? no, K can be first? but we have K at the end, but it could be in the word twice? We don't know. The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates. In the first guess, we had no duplicates, and in the second, we had no duplicates. But the secret word might have duplicates? We don't know.

In the pattern, we have K at position 5. If the first letter is K, then K would be in the word twice? But that's possible. However, in the second guess, we had K at position 5 and it was correct, but if the word has two K's, we wouldn't know from that. But in the feedback for ""brick"", K was marked correct at position 5, but if there were another K, we wouldn't have information about it.

But for now, let's not assume duplicates. We'll consider the possibility.

So for first position: letters not excluded: C (but we know not position 1), A, N, E, B, I are excluded. So available: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want common letters.

For third position: same available letters, but must form a word.

Words:
- TRUCK: T R U C K -> T and U are not excluded.
- FROCK: F R O C K -> F and O not excluded.
- WRACK: W R A C K -> A excluded, invalid.
- PRICK: P R I C K -> I excluded, invalid.
- BRICK: B excluded, invalid.
- CROCK: C at position 1, which we know is not correct, so invalid.
- DROCK: not a valid English word? I think not.
- GROCK: not a word.
- PROCK: not a word.
- TRUNK: but N is excluded? N is absent, so TRUNK has N? T R U N K -> N is in position 4? But we need C in position 4, so TRUNK has N at 4, not C. So invalid.
- Other words: ""FRISK"" but I is excluded and S is at position 4? We need C at position 4, so FRISK has S at 4, not C. Invalid.

So only TRUCK and FROCK seem common.

But what about ""CRUCK""? Not a word.

""THICK"": but H and I? I is excluded, and position 4 is C? THICK is T H I C K -> I is excluded, and position 3 is I? But we need position 4 to be C, which it is, but I is absent, so invalid.

""SHUCK"": S H U C K -> this is a word (meaning to remove the shell). S, H, U, C, K. Now, S and H and U are not excluded. And the pattern: first letter S, second R? But in SHUCK, second letter is H, not R. So it doesn't match the pattern. We need second letter R.

The pattern is fixed: position 2 is R, position 4 is C, position 5 is K.

So SHUCK has position 2 as H, not R. So no.

Similarly, ""STUCK"": S T U C K -> position 2 is T, not R. No.

So back to TRUCK and FROCK.

Another one: ""CROOK"": but C at position 1, which is invalid, and also O at position 3? C R O O K -> but position 1 is C, which we know is wrong, and also we need position 4 to be C? But in CROOK, position 4 is O, not C. So invalid.

""BROOK"": B is excluded, and position 4 is O, not C. Invalid.

So I think TRUCK and FROCK are the main options.

Now, we have to choose one. We can also consider less common words, but let's stick to common ones.

Another possibility: ""WRECK"": but E is excluded, and position 4 is C? W R E C K -> E is at position 3, which is excluded, so invalid.

""TRECK"" not a word.

So between TRUCK and FROCK, which one to guess?

We can look at which one uses more untested letters? But we don't have many guesses left, and we have two unknowns.

We can guess TRUCK because it has U, which is a vowel, and we haven't tested U or T.

FROCK has F and O.

But we are not testing for presence, we are trying to get the word.

Since we have two possibilities, we might need to choose one.

But note: there might be more words? Let me think.

""PRUCK"" not a word.

""DRACK"" not word.

""FRACK"": F R A C K -> but A is excluded, invalid.

So only two: TRUCK and FROCK.

But what about ""CROAK"": A excluded and C at position 1.

No.

""GROCK"" not word.

So I think TRUCK and FROCK are the only common ones.

But let's confirm: is there a word like ""TRICK""? No, I excluded.

Another one: ""WROKE"" not word.

So we'll choose one.

I'll go with TRUCK because it's a very common word.

So the guess is ""TRUCK"".

But note: in TRUCK, the third letter is U. We don't know if U is in the word.

If we guess TRUCK and it's not the word, we get feedback that tells us about T and U.

But since we have only two unknowns, we can solve it in the next guess if this is wrong.

Similarly for FROCK.

But let's choose TRUCK.

So the next guess is ""TRUCK"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C is present but not in position 1 (-), R is correct (✓), A, N, E are absent (x).
- **Guess 2: ""brick""** → B is absent (x), R is correct (✓), I is absent (x), C is correct (✓), K is correct (✓).

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the following fixed positions:
  - Position 2: R (confirmed correct in both guesses).
  - Position 4: C (confirmed correct in ""brick"").
  - Position 5: K (confirmed correct in ""brick"").
- The word pattern is: `_ R _ C K` (first and third letters are unknown).
- Absent letters: A, N, E (from Guess 1), B and I (from Guess 2). These cannot appear in the word.
- C cannot be in position 1 (as per Guess 1 feedback), which is consistent with the pattern.
- Possible words fitting `_ R _ C K` and avoiding absent letters include ""TRUCK"" and ""FROCK"". ""TRUCK"" is chosen to test new common letters (T and U) and because it is a high-frequency word.

### Next Guess: ""TRUCK""
- This tests:
  - T in position 1 (unknown).
  - U in position 3 (unknown).
- If correct, it solves the puzzle. If not, feedback on T and U will narrow down the possibilities (e.g., if U is absent, ""FROCK"" becomes the likely candidate).",Guess 3: truck -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) U(x) C(✓) K(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,FROCK,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: (-) meaning C is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R: (✓) meaning R is in the word and in the correct position (so the second letter of the secret word is R).
- A: (x) meaning A is not in the word.
- N: (x) meaning N is not in the word.
- E: (x) meaning E is not in the word.

So, we know:
- The second letter is R (position 2).
- The letter C is in the word, but not in the first position (since we had it in the first position and it was marked wrong position).
- The secret word does not contain A, N, or E.

We also know the secret word is 5 letters.

Let's think about possible positions for C. Since it's not in position 1, and position 2 is R, C must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Has R in the second position (because we know that's correct and we can use that to test other letters).
- Does not use the letters A, N, E (since they are absent).
- Includes the letter C in a position that is not 1 or 2 (so positions 3,4,5) but note that we don't know which one yet.

Also, we should try to include other common letters that we haven't tried yet to get more information.

Common letters in English 5-letter words (besides the ones we've tried) might include: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, etc.

We have to avoid A, N, E.

Let's try to form a word that has:
- Second letter R.
- The letter C in position 3, 4, or 5? But we don't know, so we can put it in one of those and see.
- Also, we should include other new letters to test.

Possible words:

Option 1: Put C in position 3? Then the word would be _ R C _ _

But we don't know the other letters. We need a valid word.

Let me think of words that have R as the second letter and contain C, and without A, N, E.

For example: ""TRUCK"" -> but that has T, R, U, C, K. However, we don't know if T, U, or K are in the word. Also, note that in ""crane"", the C was in position 1 and now we are moving it to position 4? Let's see:

In ""TRUCK"":
- T is first, R second, U third, C fourth, K fifth.

But we know that the secret word has C, but not in position 1. So if we put C in position 4, that might be a good test.

However, we also have to consider that the feedback for C in the first guess was that it is present but in the wrong position. So in the secret word, C is at position 3,4, or 5.

We can try to test C in position 3, 4, and 5? But we can only test one at a time.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has C in a different position and also tests other common letters.

Another idea: since we know R is fixed in position 2, we can try to use words that have R in the middle and test other vowels? But we know A and E are out, so vowels left: I, O, U.

Let me list some words that fit:
- ""CRISP"": but C is in position 1 again? We know C is not in position 1, so we shouldn't put C in position 1. Also, we have to avoid A, N, E. ""CRISP"" has C in position 1, which we know is wrong, so that would be a waste because we already know C isn't in position 1.

We need a word that has R in position 2 and C in position 3,4, or 5.

Examples:
- Position 3: ""ORCIN"" -> not a common word? Also, we don't know if O is in the word.
- Position 4: ""FORCE"" -> but E is out, so we can't use E.
- Position 5: ""SCURF"" -> S, C, U, R, F? But R is in position 4? We need R in position 2.

Wait, we need R in position 2. So the word must be: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

And we want to include C in one of positions 3,4,5.

Also, no A, N, E.

Let me think of words that start with a consonant, then R, then ... and include C.

Possible words:
- ""TRICE"": but E is out -> invalid because of E.
- ""PRICK"": P, R, I, C, K -> this seems valid. Letters: P, R, I, C, K. No A, N, E.
- ""BRICK"": B, R, I, C, K -> also valid.

Both ""PRICK"" and ""BRICK"" are valid.

But note: in the first guess, we had C in position 1 and it was wrong position. Now if we put C in position 4 (in ""BRICK"" or ""PRICK""), that would be a new position.

We can also consider other words that have C in position 5? Like ""CURRY"" but that has two R's and we don't know about duplicates. Also, C is in position 1 again? No, we are avoiding position 1 for C.

Another word: ""SCREW"" -> but that has S, C, R, E, W -> E is out, so invalid.

""SCRUM"" -> S, C, R, U, M -> but R is in position 3? We need R in position 2. So the structure must be: [not C] R ... and then C in 3,4,5.

So for ""SCRUM"", the first letter is S, then C? That would be S C R ... -> so R is in position 3, not 2. So that doesn't have R in position 2.

We need the word to be of the form: [letter] R [letter] [letter] [letter]

So let's try to list:

- ""DRUMS"" -> D R U M S -> no C, but we need to test C? Actually, we don't have to test C in this guess? We can test other letters and leave C for later? But we know C is in the word, so we should try to find its position.

Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't have C but tests other letters? But that might not be efficient because we know C is in the word and we need to find where.

So I think it's better to include C in the guess to test its position.

Therefore, let's choose a word that has R in position 2 and C in one of 3,4,5.

Options:
- Position 3: ""TRICK"" -> T R I C K -> valid. But note: we have T and I and K to test.
- Position 4: ""BROCK"" -> B R O C K -> valid? Brock is a name, but also a word? We need a common word. Alternatively, ""CROCK"" has C at position 1? No, C R O C K -> C is at 1 and 4? We know C is not at 1, so we can't use C at position 1. So ""CROCK"" is invalid because it has C at position 1? But we are allowed to use words that have C at position 1? The feedback will tell us it's wrong position again, but we already know that. However, it might be better to avoid position 1 for C to test a new position.

But in ""CROCK"", we have C at position 1 and 4. We know position 1 is wrong, but position 4 might be correct? However, we are not sure. Also, we are using a duplicate C? The secret word might have only one C? We don't know.

To avoid confusion, let's choose a word without duplicate letters and without C in position 1.

So ""TRICK"" and ""BRICK"" are good.

""PRICK"" is also good.

I'll choose ""BRICK"": 
- B in position 1: we don't know if B is in the word.
- R in position 2: correct (we know that, so it will be ✓)
- I in position 3: test if I is in the word and in that position.
- C in position 4: test if C is in position 4 (if it is, we get ✓, if not, we might get - or x)
- K in position 5: test K.

This guess will give us information about B, I, C, and K.

Also, note that we are not using any of the forbidden letters (A, N, E).

So let's go with ""BRICK"".

But wait, we have to consider: what if the secret word has C in position 3? Then in ""BRICK"", C is in position 4, which would be wrong position? But we would get feedback that C is present but wrong position? Then we would know it's not in position 4, but we still don't know if it's in 3 or 5.

Alternatively, if we put C in position 3, we might get it correct if it is in 3.

But we don't know, so we have to choose one.

I think ""BRICK"" is a reasonable guess.

Another option: ""CRWTH"" is not common.

So I'll go with ""BRICK"".

But note: we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""brick"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next guess is ""BRICK"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (marked as -).
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, marked as ✓).
- A, N, and E are not in the word (marked as x).

Key insights:
- The secret word has R as the second letter.
- C is present but must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (since it's not in position 1, and position 2 is R).
- Avoid using A, N, or E in the new guess.

For the next guess:
- I chose ""BRICK"" because:
  - It has R in position 2 (to confirm and maintain the known correct position).
  - It places C in position 4 (to test if C is in position 4; if not, the feedback will help narrow down C's position to 3 or 5).
  - It introduces new common letters (B, I, K) to test for presence/absence and positions.
  - It avoids the excluded letters (A, N, E) and uses distinct letters to maximize information.

This guess should provide valuable feedback on the positions of C and the presence of B, I, and K.

- E: absent

Guess 2: ""brick""
- B: absent (so B is not in the word)
- R: correct position (as we already knew, so second letter is R)
- I: absent (so I is not in the word)
- C: correct position (so C is at position 4)
- K: correct position (so K is at position 5)

Therefore, we now know:
- The secret word has the second letter R, fourth letter C, and fifth letter K. So the word is _ R _ C K.
- The first letter is unknown, and the third letter is unknown.
- We know that A, N, E, B, and I are absent.

Also, from the first guess, we know C is present and not in position 1, which is consistent with it being in position 4.

Now, we need to find a word that fits the pattern: [letter1] R [letter3] C K

We must avoid the letters: A, N, E, B, I.

We need to guess a word that has this pattern and uses letters that are possible.

Common letters that haven't been tested yet: S, T, L, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, etc.

We can try to think of words that match _ R _ C K.

Possible words:
- TRUCK: but E is absent (from guess1) and U hasn't been tested? But in TRUCK, we have T, R, U, C, K. However, we know E is absent, but U is new. But note: in TRUCK, the third letter is U. However, we must check if U is allowed? We haven't ruled out U. But wait, in the pattern, the third letter is unknown. However, TRUCK has C in position 4 and K in position 5, which matches. But we must avoid E, which is not in TRUCK, so it's okay. However, we have to see if it's valid.

But let's list possible words:

- WRICK: not common? Or is it? Wrick is a word? Maybe, but let's see.
- PRICK: P R I C K -> but I is absent, so invalid.
- CROCK: C is at position 1? But we know C is at position 4, and in CROCK, C is at 1 and 4? But we know position 1 is not C (from first guess feedback). Also, we are avoiding duplicate testing? But the pattern is _ R _ C K, so first letter cannot be C? Because if it were C, then in the first guess, when we had C at position 1, it would have been marked as correct? But it was marked as wrong position, so position 1 is not C. Therefore, CROCK would have C at position 1 which is incorrect, so it's not the word. Also, we are avoiding C at position 1.

Back to possible words: _ R _ C K

We need a 5-letter word with second letter R, fourth letter C, fifth letter K, and without A, N, E, B, I.

Let me think of common words:
- TRUCK: T R U C K -> T and U are unknown and not excluded.
- DROCK: not a common word? Drock is not standard.
- FROCK: F R O C K -> O is unknown. Frock is a word (a type of garment).
- PROCK: not a word.
- GROCK: not a word.
- CROCK: but first letter C is invalid as per pattern? Pattern first letter must not be C, and also we know it's not C. So CROCK is invalid because of first letter C.

So the main candidates are TRUCK and FROCK.

But we have to choose one for the guess.

We can also consider WRACK, but A is absent, so no.

Another one: TRUCK and FROCK are the most common.

We can also think of ""wrack"" but A is out.

""PRICK"" has I, which is out.

""BRICK"" has B, which is out.

So between TRUCK and FROCK, which one to choose?

We can choose TRUCK because it has U, which is a vowel we haven't tested, and T is a common consonant.

But note: we are not just testing, we are trying to guess the word. Since we have three positions known (R, C, K) and only two unknown, we can try to guess.

But we have two possibilities? Actually, there might be more.

Another word: ""CRAKE"" but A and E are out.

""CRUCK"" not a word.

""DRACK"" not common.

So let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and avoid the excluded letters.

Excluded letters: A, N, E, B, I.

Possible letters for first position: any letter except A, N, E, B, I, and also not C (since we know position 1 is not C from first guess). So available: D, F, G, H, J, K (but K is at the end, so not first? no, K can be first? but we have K at the end, but it could be in the word twice? We don't know. The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates. In the first guess, we had no duplicates, and in the second, we had no duplicates. But the secret word might have duplicates? We don't know.

In the pattern, we have K at position 5. If the first letter is K, then K would be in the word twice? But that's possible. However, in the second guess, we had K at position 5 and it was correct, but if the word has two K's, we wouldn't know from that. But in the feedback for ""brick"", K was marked correct at position 5, but if there were another K, we wouldn't have information about it.

But for now, let's not assume duplicates. We'll consider the possibility.

So for first position: letters not excluded: C (but we know not position 1), A, N, E, B, I are excluded. So available: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want common letters.

For third position: same available letters, but must form a word.

Words:
- TRUCK: T R U C K -> T and U are not excluded.
- FROCK: F R O C K -> F and O not excluded.
- WRACK: W R A C K -> A excluded, invalid.
- PRICK: P R I C K -> I excluded, invalid.
- BRICK: B excluded, invalid.
- CROCK: C at position 1, which we know is not correct, so invalid.
- DROCK: not a valid English word? I think not.
- GROCK: not a word.
- PROCK: not a word.
- TRUNK: but N is excluded? N is absent, so TRUNK has N? T R U N K -> N is in position 4? But we need C in position 4, so TRUNK has N at 4, not C. So invalid.
- Other words: ""FRISK"" but I is excluded and S is at position 4? We need C at position 4, so FRISK has S at 4, not C. Invalid.

So only TRUCK and FROCK seem common.

But what about ""CRUCK""? Not a word.

""THICK"": but H and I? I is excluded, and position 4 is C? THICK is T H I C K -> I is excluded, and position 3 is I? But we need position 4 to be C, which it is, but I is absent, so invalid.

""SHUCK"": S H U C K -> this is a word (meaning to remove the shell). S, H, U, C, K. Now, S and H and U are not excluded. And the pattern: first letter S, second R? But in SHUCK, second letter is H, not R. So it doesn't match the pattern. We need second letter R.

The pattern is fixed: position 2 is R, position 4 is C, position 5 is K.

So SHUCK has position 2 as H, not R. So no.

Similarly, ""STUCK"": S T U C K -> position 2 is T, not R. No.

So back to TRUCK and FROCK.

Another one: ""CROOK"": but C at position 1, which is invalid, and also O at position 3? C R O O K -> but position 1 is C, which we know is wrong, and also we need position 4 to be C? But in CROOK, position 4 is O, not C. So invalid.

""BROOK"": B is excluded, and position 4 is O, not C. Invalid.

So I think TRUCK and FROCK are the main options.

Now, we have to choose one. We can also consider less common words, but let's stick to common ones.

Another possibility: ""WRECK"": but E is excluded, and position 4 is C? W R E C K -> E is at position 3, which is excluded, so invalid.

""TRECK"" not a word.

So between TRUCK and FROCK, which one to guess?

We can look at which one uses more untested letters? But we don't have many guesses left, and we have two unknowns.

We can guess TRUCK because it has U, which is a vowel, and we haven't tested U or T.

FROCK has F and O.

But we are not testing for presence, we are trying to get the word.

Since we have two possibilities, we might need to choose one.

But note: there might be more words? Let me think.

""PRUCK"" not a word.

""DRACK"" not word.

""FRACK"": F R A C K -> but A is excluded, invalid.

So only two: TRUCK and FROCK.

But what about ""CROAK"": A excluded and C at position 1.

No.

""GROCK"" not word.

So I think TRUCK and FROCK are the only common ones.

But let's confirm: is there a word like ""TRICK""? No, I excluded.

Another one: ""WROKE"" not word.

So we'll choose one.

I'll go with TRUCK because it's a very common word.

So the guess is ""TRUCK"".

But note: in TRUCK, the third letter is U. We don't know if U is in the word.

If we guess TRUCK and it's not the word, we get feedback that tells us about T and U.

But since we have only two unknowns, we can solve it in the next guess if this is wrong.

Similarly for FROCK.

But let's choose TRUCK.

So the next guess is ""TRUCK"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C is present but not in position 1 (-), R is correct (✓), A, N, E are absent (x).
- **Guess 2: ""brick""** → B is absent (x), R is correct (✓), I is absent (x), C is correct (✓), K is correct (✓).

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the following fixed positions:
  - Position 2: R (confirmed correct in both guesses).
  - Position 4: C (confirmed correct in ""brick"").
  - Position 5: K (confirmed correct in ""brick"").
- The word pattern is: `_ R _ C K` (first and third letters are unknown).
- Absent letters: A, N, E (from Guess 1), B and I (from Guess 2). These cannot appear in the word.
- C cannot be in position 1 (as per Guess 1 feedback), which is consistent with the pattern.
- Possible words fitting `_ R _ C K` and avoiding absent letters include ""TRUCK"" and ""FROCK"". ""TRUCK"" is chosen to test new common letters (T and U) and because it is a high-frequency word.

### Next Guess: ""TRUCK""
- This tests:
  - T in position 1 (unknown).
  - U in position 3 (unknown).
- If correct, it solves the puzzle. If not, feedback on T and U will narrow down the possibilities (e.g., if U is absent, ""FROCK"" becomes the likely candidate).

Since it\'s not in position 1, and position 2 is R, C must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5.\n\nWe need to make a new guess that:\n- Has R in the second position (because we know that\'s correct and we can use that to test other letters).\n- Does not use the letters A, N, E (since they are absent).\n- Includes the letter C in a position that is not 1 or 2 (so positions 3,4,5) but note that we don\'t know which one yet.\n\nAlso, we should try to include other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet to get more information.\n\nCommon letters in English 5-letter words (besides the ones we\'ve tried) might include: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, etc.\n\nWe have to avoid A, N, E.\n\nLet\'s try to form a word that has:\n- Second letter R.\n- The letter C in position 3, 4, or 5? But we don\'t know, so we can put it in one of those and see.\n- Also, we should include other new letters to test.\n\nPossible words:\n\nOption 1: Put C in position 3? Then the word would be _ R C _ _\n\nBut we don\'t know the other letters. We need a valid word.\n\nLet me think of words that have R as the second letter and contain C, and without A, N, E.\n\nFor example: ""TRUCK"" -> but that has T, R, U, C, K. However, we don\'t know if T, U, or K are in the word. Also, note that in ""crane"", the C was in position 1 and now we are moving it to position 4? Let\'s see:\n\nIn ""TRUCK"":\n- T is first, R second, U third, C fourth, K fifth.\n\nBut we know that the secret word has C, but not in position 1. So if we put C in position 4, that might be a good test.\n\nHowever, we also have to consider that the feedback for C in the first guess was that it is present but in the wrong position. So in the secret word, C is at position 3,4, or 5.\n\nWe can try to test C in position 3, 4, and 5? But we can only test one at a time.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use a word that has C in a different position and also tests other common letters.\n\nAnother idea: since we know R is fixed in position 2, we can try to use words that have R in the middle and test other vowels? But we know A and E are out, so vowels left: I, O, U.\n\nLet me list some words that fit:\n- ""CRISP"": but C is in position 1 again? We know C is not in position 1, so we shouldn\'t put C in position 1. Also, we have to avoid A, N, E. ""CRISP"" has C in position 1, which we know is wrong, so that would be a waste because we already know C isn\'t in position 1.\n\nWe need a word that has R in position 2 and C in position 3,4, or 5.\n\nExamples:\n- Position 3: ""ORCIN"" -> not a common word? Also, we don\'t know if O is in the word.\n- Position 4: ""FORCE"" -> but E is out, so we can\'t use E.\n- Position 5: ""SCURF"" -> S, C, U, R, F? But R is in position 4? We need R in position 2.\n\nWait, we need R in position 2. So the word must be: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]\n\nAnd we want to include C in one of positions 3,4,5.\n\nAlso, no A, N, E.\n\nLet me think of words that start with a consonant, then R, then ... and include C.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""TRICE"": but E is out -> invalid because of E.\n- ""PRICK"": P, R, I, C, K -> this seems valid. Letters: P, R, I, C, K. No A, N, E.\n- ""BRICK"": B, R, I, C, K -> also valid.\n\nBoth ""PRICK"" and ""BRICK"" are valid.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had C in position 1 and it was wrong position. Now if we put C in position 4 (in ""BRICK"" or ""PRICK""), that would be a new position.\n\nWe can also consider other words that have C in position 5? Like ""CURRY"" but that has two R\'s and we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, C is in position 1 again? No, we are avoiding position 1 for C.\n\nAnother word: ""SCREW"" -> but that has S, C, R, E, W -> E is out, so invalid.\n\n""SCRUM"" -> S, C, R, U, M -> but R is in position 3? We need R in position 2. So the structure must be: [not C] R ... and then C in 3,4,5.\n\nSo for ""SCRUM"", the first letter is S, then C? That would be S C R ... -> so R is in position 3, not 2. So that doesn\'t have R in position 2.\n\nWe need the word to be of the form: [letter] R [letter] [letter] [letter]\n\nSo let\'s try to list:\n\n- ""DRUMS"" -> D R U M S -> no C, but we need to test C? Actually, we don\'t have to test C in this guess? We can test other letters and leave C for later? But we know C is in the word, so we should try to find its position.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that doesn\'t have C but tests other letters? But that might not be efficient because we know C is in the word and we need to find where.\n\nSo I think it\'s better to include C in the guess to test its position.\n\nTherefore, let\'s choose a word that has R in position 2 and C in one of 3,4,5.\n\nOptions:\n- Position 3: ""TRICK"" -> T R I C K -> valid. But note: we have T and I and K to test.\n- Position 4: ""BROCK"" -> B R O C K -> valid? Brock is a name, but also a word? We need a common word. Alternatively, ""CROCK"" has C at position 1? No, C R O C K -> C is at 1 and 4? We know C is not at 1, so we can\'t use C at position 1. So ""CROCK"" is invalid because it has C at position 1? But we are allowed to use words that have C at position 1? The feedback will tell us it\'s wrong position again, but we already know that. However, it might be better to avoid position 1 for C to test a new position.\n\nBut in ""CROCK"", we have C at position 1 and 4. We know position 1 is wrong, but position 4 might be correct? However, we are not sure. Also, we are using a duplicate C? The secret word might have only one C? We don\'t know.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let\'s choose a word without duplicate letters and without C in position 1.\n\nSo ""TRICK"" and ""BRICK"" are good.\n\n""PRICK"" is also good.\n\nI\'ll choose ""BRICK"": \n- B in position 1: we don\'t know if B is in the word.\n- R in position 2: correct (we know that, so it will be ✓)\n- I in position 3: test if I is in the word and in that position.\n- C in position 4: test if C is in position 4 (if it is, we get ✓, if not, we might get - or x)\n- K in position 5: test K.\n\nThis guess will give us information about B, I, C, and K.\n\nAlso, note that we are not using any of the forbidden letters (A, N, E).\n\nSo let\'s go with ""BRICK"".\n\nBut wait, we have to consider: what if the secret word has C in position 3? Then in ""BRICK"", C is in position 4, which would be wrong position? But we would get feedback that C is present but wrong position? Then we would know it\'s not in position 4, but we still don\'t know if it\'s in 3 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, if we put C in position 3, we might get it correct if it is in 3.\n\nBut we don\'t know, so we have to choose one.\n\nI think ""BRICK"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nAnother option: ""CRWTH"" is not common.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""BRICK"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure it\'s a valid word. Yes, ""brick"" is a valid English word.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""BRICK"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is in the word but not in position 1 (marked as -).\n- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, marked as ✓).\n- A, N, and E are not in the word (marked as x).\n\nKey insights:\n- The secret word has R as the second letter.\n- C is present but must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (since it\'s not in position 1, and position 2 is R).\n- Avoid using A, N, or E in the new guess.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- I chose ""BRICK"" because:\n  - It has R in position 2 (to confirm and maintain the known correct position).\n  - It places C in position 4 (to test if C is in position 4; if not, the feedback will help narrow down C\'s position to 3 or 5).\n  - It introduces new common letters (B, I, K) to test for presence/absence and positions.\n  - It avoids the excluded letters (A, N, E) and uses distinct letters to maximize information.\n\nThis guess should provide valuable feedback on the positions of C and the presence of B, I, and K.\n\n<guess>brick</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: brick -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(x) C(✓) K(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: present but wrong position (so C is in the word, not at position 1)\n- R: correct position (so the second letter is R)\n- A: absent\n- N: absent\n- E: absent\n\nGuess 2: ""brick""\n- B: absent (so B is not in the word)\n- R: correct position (as we already knew, so second letter is R)\n- I: absent (so I is not in the word)\n- C: correct position (so C is at position 4)\n- K: correct position (so K is at position 5)\n\nTherefore, we now know:\n- The secret word has the second letter R, fourth letter C, and fifth letter K.

But wait, in the pattern, the third letter is unknown. However, TRUCK has C in position 4 and K in position 5, which matches. But we must avoid E, which is not in TRUCK, so it\'s okay.

But we know position 1 is not C (from first guess feedback). Also, we are avoiding duplicate testing? But the pattern is _ R _ C K, so first letter cannot be C? Because if it were C, then in the first guess, when we had C at position 1, it would have been marked as correct? But it was marked as wrong position, so position 1 is not C. Therefore, CROCK would have C at position 1 which is incorrect, so it\'s not the word. Also, we are avoiding C at position 1.\n\nBack to possible words: _ R _ C K\n\nWe need a 5-letter word with second letter R, fourth letter C, fifth letter K, and without A, N, E, B, I.\n\nLet me think of common words:\n- TRUCK: T R U C K -> T and U are unknown and not excluded.\n- DROCK: not a common word? Drock is not standard.\n- FROCK: F R O C K -> O is unknown. Frock is a word (a type of garment).\n- PROCK: not a word.\n- GROCK: not a word.\n- CROCK: but first letter C is invalid as per pattern? Pattern first letter must not be C, and also we know it\'s not C. So CROCK is invalid because of first letter C.\n\nSo the main candidates are TRUCK and FROCK.\n\nBut we have to choose one for the guess.\n\nWe can also consider WRACK, but A is absent, so no.\n\nAnother one: TRUCK and FROCK are the most common.\n\nWe can also think of ""wrack"" but A is out.\n\n""PRICK"" has I, which is out.\n\n""BRICK"" has B, which is out.\n\nSo between TRUCK and FROCK, which one to choose?\n\nWe can choose TRUCK because it has U, which is a vowel we haven\'t tested, and T is a common consonant.\n\nBut note: we are not just testing, we are trying to guess the word. Since we have three positions known (R, C, K) and only two unknown, we can try to guess.\n\nBut we have two possibilities? Actually, there might be more.\n\nAnother word: ""CRAKE"" but A and E are out.\n\n""CRUCK"" not a word.\n\n""DRACK"" not common.\n\nSo let\'s list all possible words that fit the pattern and avoid the excluded letters.\n\nExcluded letters: A, N, E, B, I.\n\nPossible letters for first position: any letter except A, N, E, B, I, and also not C (since we know position 1 is not C from first guess). So available: D, F, G, H, J, K (but K is at the end, so not first? no, K can be first? but we have K at the end, but it could be in the word twice? We don\'t know. The feedback doesn\'t say anything about duplicates. In the first guess, we had no duplicates, and in the second, we had no duplicates. But the secret word might have duplicates? We don\'t know.\n\nIn the pattern, we have K at position 5. If the first letter is K, then K would be in the word twice? But that\'s possible. However, in the second guess, we had K at position 5 and it was correct, but if the word has two K\'s, we wouldn\'t know from that. But in the feedback for ""brick"", K was marked correct at position 5, but if there were another K, we wouldn\'t have information about it.\n\nBut for now, let\'s not assume duplicates. We\'ll consider the possibility.\n\nSo for first position: letters not excluded: C (but we know not position 1), A, N, E, B, I are excluded. So available: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we want common letters.\n\nFor third position: same available letters, but must form a word.\n\nWords:\n- TRUCK: T R U C K -> T and U are not excluded.\n- FROCK: F R O C K -> F and O not excluded.\n- WRACK: W R A C K -> A excluded, invalid.\n- PRICK: P R I C K -> I excluded, invalid.\n- BRICK: B excluded, invalid.\n- CROCK: C at position 1, which we know is not correct, so invalid.\n- DROCK: not a valid English word? I think not.\n- GROCK: not a word.\n- PROCK: not a word.\n- TRUNK: but N is excluded? N is absent, so TRUNK has N? T R U N K -> N is in position 4? But we need C in position 4, so TRUNK has N at 4, not C. So invalid.\n- Other words: ""FRISK"" but I is excluded and S is at position 4? We need C at position 4, so FRISK has S at 4, not C. Invalid.\n\nSo only TRUCK and FROCK seem common.\n\nBut what about ""CRUCK""? Not a word.\n\n""THICK"": but H and I? I is excluded, and position 4 is C? THICK is T H I C K -> I is excluded, and position 3 is I? But we need position 4 to be C, which it is, but I is absent, so invalid.\n\n""SHUCK"": S H U C K -> this is a word (meaning to remove the shell). S, H, U, C, K. Now, S and H and U are not excluded. And the pattern: first letter S, second R? But in SHUCK, second letter is H, not R. So it doesn\'t match the pattern. We need second letter R.\n\nThe pattern is fixed: position 2 is R, position 4 is C, position 5 is K.\n\nSo SHUCK has position 2 as H, not R. So no.\n\nSimilarly, ""STUCK"": S T U C K -> position 2 is T, not R. No.\n\nSo back to TRUCK and FROCK.\n\nAnother one: ""CROOK"": but C at position 1, which is invalid, and also O at position 3? C R O O K -> but position 1 is C, which we know is wrong, and also we need position 4 to be C? But in CROOK, position 4 is O, not C. So invalid.\n\n""BROOK"": B is excluded, and position 4 is O, not C. Invalid.\n\nSo I think TRUCK and FROCK are the main options.\n\nNow, we have to choose one. We can also consider less common words, but let\'s stick to common ones.\n\nAnother possibility: ""WRECK"": but E is excluded, and position 4 is C? W R E C K -> E is at position 3, which is excluded, so invalid.\n\n""TRECK"" not a word.\n\nSo between TRUCK and FROCK, which one to guess?\n\nWe can look at which one uses more untested letters? But we don\'t have many guesses left, and we have two unknowns.\n\nWe can guess TRUCK because it has U, which is a vowel, and we haven\'t tested U or T.\n\nFROCK has F and O.\n\nBut we are not testing for presence, we are trying to get the word.\n\nSince we have two possibilities, we might need to choose one.\n\nBut note: there might be more words? Let me think.\n\n""PRUCK"" not a word.\n\n""DRACK"" not word.\n\n""FRACK"": F R A C K -> but A is excluded, invalid.\n\nSo only two: TRUCK and FROCK.\n\nBut what about ""CROAK"": A excluded and C at position 1.\n\nNo.\n\n""GROCK"" not word.\n\nSo I think TRUCK and FROCK are the only common ones.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: is there a word like ""TRICK""? No, I excluded.\n\nAnother one: ""WROKE"" not word.\n\nSo we\'ll choose one.\n\nI\'ll go with TRUCK because it\'s a very common word.\n\nSo the guess is ""TRUCK"".\n\nBut note: in TRUCK, the third letter is U. We don\'t know if U is in the word.\n\nIf we guess TRUCK and it\'s not the word, we get feedback that tells us about T and U.\n\nBut since we have only two unknowns, we can solve it in the next guess if this is wrong.\n\nSimilarly for FROCK.\n\nBut let\'s choose TRUCK.\n\nSo the next guess is ""TRUCK"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C is present but not in position 1 (-), R is correct (✓), A, N, E are absent (x).\n- **Guess 2: ""brick""** → B is absent (x), R is correct (✓), I is absent (x), C is correct (✓), K is correct (✓).\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word has the following fixed positions:\n  - Position 2: R (confirmed correct in both guesses).\n  - Position 4: C (confirmed correct in ""brick"").\n  - Position 5: K (confirmed correct in ""brick"").\n- The word pattern is: `_ R _ C K` (first and third letters are unknown).\n- Absent letters: A, N, E (from Guess 1), B and I (from Guess 2). These cannot appear in the word.\n- C cannot be in position 1 (as per Guess 1 feedback), which is consistent with the pattern.\n- Possible words fitting `_ R _ C K` and avoiding absent letters include ""TRUCK"" and ""FROCK"". ""TRUCK"" is chosen to test new common letters (T and U) and because it is a high-frequency word.\n\n### Next Guess: ""TRUCK""\n- This tests:\n  - T in position 1 (unknown).\n  - U in position 3 (unknown).\n- If correct, it solves the puzzle. If not, feedback on T and U will narrow down the possibilities (e.g., if U is absent, ""FROCK"" becomes the likely candidate).\n\n<guess>truck</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: brick -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(x) C(✓) K(✓)\nGuess 3: truck -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) U(x) C(✓) K(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: present but wrong position (so C is in the word, not at position 1)
- R: correct position (position 2)
- A: absent
- N: absent
- E: absent

Guess 2: ""brick""
- B: absent
- R: correct position (position 2)
- I: absent
- C: correct position (position 4)
- K: correct position (position 5)

Guess 3: ""truck""
- T: absent
- R: correct position (position 2)
- U: absent
- C: correct position (position 4)
- K: correct position (position 5)

So we know:
- The word is _ R _ C K
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- Position 4: C (fixed)
- Position 5: K (fixed)
- Absent letters: A, N, E, B, I, T, U (from feedback: A, N, E from guess1; B, I from guess2; T, U from guess3)
- Therefore, the first and third letters must be from the remaining letters that haven't been tested and are not absent.

We also know that C is in position 4, so it cannot be in position 1 or 3? But we don't have information about position 3 yet, but since C is fixed at 4, and we have no duplicate indication, we assume no duplicate C for now.

Now, the pattern: [letter1] R [letter3] C K

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits this pattern, with letter1 and letter3 not being any of the absent letters: A, B, E, I, N, T, U.

Available letters: We have used: C, R, A, N, E, B, I, T, U. So absent: A, B, E, I, N, T, U.

Available consonants: C and R are used, but they are in the word. We can use other consonants: D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Available vowels: O is the only vowel left that hasn't been tested? Vowels: A, E, I, O, U. We have A, E, I, U absent, so only O is possible? But O might be in the word.

So for letter1 and letter3, we can use: D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need to form a valid English word.

Now, what words fit _ R _ C K?

We previously considered ""FROCK"" (F R O C K). Let's check if it uses only available letters:
- F: not absent, so possible.
- R: correct.
- O: not absent, so possible.
- C: correct.
- K: correct.

Also, ""FROCK"" avoids all absent letters.

Are there other possibilities?

For example:
- ""DROCK"": not a common word? (drock might not be standard)
- ""GROCK"": not a word.
- ""PROCK"": not a word.
- ""WROCK"": not common? (wrock might refer to wizard rock, but not standard word)
- ""CROCK"": but C at position 1, which we know is not possible because in guess1, C was in position 1 and was wrong position, and also we have C at position 4. But if we use ""CROCK"", it has C at position 1 and 4, but position 1 C is invalid. So not.
- ""BLOCK"": but B is absent and L at position 3? Pattern requires position 4 to be C, but ""BLOCK"" has O at 2? No, B L O C K -> position 2 is L, not R. So no.
- ""CLOCK"": C at position 1, invalid.
- ""FRICK"": but I is absent? F R I C K -> I is at position 3, but I is absent, so invalid.
- ""PRICK"": I absent, invalid.
- ""TRUCK"": we tried, and T and U absent, so not.
- ""WRACK"": A absent, invalid.
- ""WRECK"": E absent, invalid.
- ""BRICK"": B absent, invalid.

What about ""FROCK""? It seems the only common word left.

Another possibility: ""CROOK"" but C at position 1, invalid.

""BROOK"": B absent and position 4 is O, not C.

""GROOK"": not a word.

So ""FROCK"" is the only common word that fits.

Therefore, we should guess ""FROCK"".

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if it's correct: F(?) R(✓) O(?) C(✓) K(✓). We don't know about F and O, but if the word is ""FROCK"", then F should be correct at position 1 and O correct at position 3.

If it's not ""FROCK"", then we might get feedback that F or O is wrong, but given the constraints, it should be ""FROCK"".

We have no other common words, so we go with ""FROCK"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, here's a step-by-step analysis:

### Key Insights from Feedback:
1. **Fixed Positions**:
   - Position 2: R (✓ in all guesses).
   - Position 4: C (✓ in Guess 2 and 3).
   - Position 5: K (✓ in Guess 2 and 3).
   - The word pattern is: `_ R _ C K`.

2. **Absent Letters** (cannot be in the word):
   - From Guess 1: A, N, E (x).
   - From Guess 2: B, I (x).
   - From Guess 3: T, U (x).
   - **Total absent letters**: A, B, E, I, N, T, U.

3. **Available Letters**:
   - The first and third positions must use letters not in the absent list. Possible letters include: D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - Vowels: Only O remains untested (since A, E, I, U are absent).

4. **Possible Words**:
   - The only common English word fitting `_ R _ C K` and avoiding absent letters is **FROCK** (F R O C K).
     - F and O are untested and available.
     - Alternatives like ""TRUCK"" (already guessed, with T/U absent) or ""CROCK"" (C in position 1, invalid per Guess 1 feedback) are ruled out.
   - If ""FROCK"" is correct, feedback should show F(✓), R(✓), O(✓), C(✓), K(✓).

### Next Guess: ""FROCK""
- Tests F in position 1 and O in position 3.
- If correct, it solves the puzzle. If not, feedback will confirm if F/O are present and their positions, narrowing options further (though ""FROCK"" is highly likely given constraints).

<guess>frock</guess>",frock,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: present but wrong position (so C is in the word, not at position 1)
- R: correct position (position 2)
- A: absent
- N: absent
- E: absent

Guess 2: ""brick""
- B: absent
- R: correct position (position 2)
- I: absent
- C: correct position (position 4)
- K: correct position (position 5)

Guess 3: ""truck""
- T: absent
- R: correct position (position 2)
- U: absent
- C: correct position (position 4)
- K: correct position (position 5)

So we know:
- The word is _ R _ C K
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- Position 4: C (fixed)
- Position 5: K (fixed)
- Absent letters: A, N, E, B, I, T, U (from feedback: A, N, E from guess1; B, I from guess2; T, U from guess3)
- Therefore, the first and third letters must be from the remaining letters that haven't been tested and are not absent.

We also know that C is in position 4, so it cannot be in position 1 or 3? But we don't have information about position 3 yet, but since C is fixed at 4, and we have no duplicate indication, we assume no duplicate C for now.

- ""BLOCK"": but B is absent and L at position 3? Pattern requires position 4 to be C, but ""BLOCK"" has O at 2? No, B L O C K -> position 2 is L, not R. So no.
- ""CLOCK"": C at position 1, invalid.
- ""FRICK"": but I is absent? F R I C K -> I is at position 3, but I is absent, so invalid.
- ""PRICK"": I absent, invalid.
- ""TRUCK"": we tried, and T and U absent, so not.

Another possibility: ""CROOK"" but C at position 1, invalid.

""BROOK"": B absent and position 4 is O, not C.
