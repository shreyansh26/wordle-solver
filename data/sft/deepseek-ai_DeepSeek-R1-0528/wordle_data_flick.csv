We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We have feedback from the first guess: crane -> C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
 Interpretation:
  - C is in the word but not in the first position (since it's marked with - meaning wrong position)
  - R, A, N, E are not in the word at all (marked with x)

 Since C is present but not in the first position, it must be in one of positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
 Also, we know that R, A, N, E are absent.

 For the next guess, we should try to include the letter C in a different position and use other common letters that haven't been tried yet.

 Letters we have tried: C, R, A, N, E (so avoid R, A, N, E)
 We know C is in the word, so we must include it again but not at the start.

 We also want to test new letters. Some common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y
 Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)

 We need a 5-letter word that includes C (not in the first position) and avoids R, A, N, E.

 Possibilities: Let's think of words with C in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

 Since we have no information about other letters, we can try to cover more common letters.

 For example, we can try words where C is in the second position? But note: we don't know the position yet.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with C in a different position and introduce new vowels and consonants.

 Considering common letters: S, T, L, O are very common.

 Example words:
   - Could try ""COULD"": but note we have U and O (vowels we haven't tried) and C is at the start? But wait, our feedback says C is not in the first position? Actually, it's possible that C is in the first position? Let's reexamine the feedback.

 Feedback: C(-) -> the C is in the word but not in the first position? Actually, the feedback symbol (-) means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. Since we placed C at position 1, and it's wrong position, that means the word does not have C at position 1, but C is elsewhere.

 So we cannot put C at position 1 again.

 We can try placing C at position 2? Or position 3, etc.

 Let's try to choose a word that has C in position 2? For example, ""SCENT"" but S is new, C in second, E is known absent -> but we know E is absent? Yes, because feedback for E was x. So we must avoid E.

 Therefore, ""SCENT"" has E which is bad.

 Another word: ""CLOUD"" -> C at position 2? Let's see: C-L-O-U-D. But O and U are untested vowels.

 However, note: we must exclude R,A,N,E. So ""CLOUD"" doesn't contain any of these excluded letters.

 But we have the letter C in position 2, which is new. We can use that to test.

 However, note: we also want to cover more common letters. An alternative word could be ""SLICK"" or ""CHECK"" but CHECK has two E's which we know are absent.

 How about ""PICKY"": P-I-C-K-Y -> here C is in position 3. But it has I and Y as vowels? And avoids the bad letters.

 But maybe we can do better? Let's try to cover more common consonants.

 Another idea: ""MUSIC"" -> M-U-S-I-C. This has C at the end (position 5). Also, it introduces M, U, S, I. S and T are very common, but it doesn't have T.

 Alternatively, ""TOPIC"": T-O-P-I-C -> T at start, C at end. But O and I are vowels we haven't tried.

 We want to maximize the chance of hitting the word and getting more information.

 Given that we know only one letter so far (C) and it's somewhere but not at position 1.

 Let's try ""SLICE"": S-L-I-C-E -> but E is absent, so we cannot use E. So avoid.

 How about ""SPICY"": S-P-I-C-Y -> letters: S, P, I, C, Y. This seems good because:
   - C is in position 4 (which is different from position 1, so we test a new position)
   - We test S, P, I, Y (vowel I and consonant S,P,Y)
   - Avoids R,A,N,E.

 But wait, we have Y? That might be less common.

 Another word: ""PITCH"": P-I-T-C-H -> C at position 4? Actually, P-I-T-C-H: C is at position 4? Positions: P(1), I(2), T(3), C(4), H(5). So C is at 4. And we avoid forbidden letters.

 However, note: no E, R, A, N? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""CRISP"": but C is at first, but we know C is not at first? So we cannot put C at first. Therefore, ""CRISP"" is invalid because we have C at first which is known wrong.

 How about ""CHIPS"": C is at first? So that's bad.

 We need C not at first. Let me think of words starting with another letter and having C in position 2 or later.

 Other possibilities: ""BLOCK"" -> B-L-O-C-K. C is at position 4? We avoid R,A,N,E. Letters: B, L, O, C, K. These are all new and common.

 Similarly, ""CLOCK"": C at first? -> Oh, C is at first. Avoid.

 So ""BLOCK"": B(1), L(2), O(3), C(4), K(5). C is at position 4. This seems acceptable.

 But note: we are allowed to try letters that have been marked absent? Actually, we know R,A,N,E are absent so we must avoid them. For letters that are present (like C) we must include them? Not necessarily: we are allowed to guess words without C? But since we know C is in the word, it would be inefficient to ignore that information. We should include C to try to locate it.

 Therefore, we must include C and avoid R,A,N,E.

 So words: ""BLOCK"", ""STOCK"" (but O is a vowel), ""STICK"" (I vowel), etc.

 I think ""BLOCK"" is a reasonable choice? But let me check the commonality.

 Alternatively, ""MUCKY"" - not very common.

 Let me choose ""BLOCK"": B, L, O, C, K.

 We test:
   - B at position 1: if it is in the word and if correct or not.
   - L at 2
   - O at 3
   - C at 4: we know C is in the word so we expect it to be marked either (-) or (✓). If it's not position 4, then we get (-) meaning it's elsewhere (and we know it's not position 1 from previous feedback, so then in positions 2,3,5? But we have positions: 1 is B so then 2,3,5). But we are testing L at 2, O at 3, and K at 5. So if we get feedback on C at 4, it may be correct or move.

 However, note: we have only 5 tries left? Actually, we used one, so 5 left? But we are at the second guess.

 But to be safe, let's try a word that has more new letters and also includes C.

 Another common word: ""CHAMP"" but C at first? avoid.

 ""PACKS"": P-A-C-K-S -> but A is absent? We know A is absent from the first feedback? Wait, no: in the first feedback, A was marked with x, so absent. So we must avoid A. So ""PACKS"" is invalid because it has A.

 ""PICKS"": P-I-C-K-S -> C is at position 3. That might be better because we don't know about position 3? So that's a good test.

 But ""PICKS"" has P, I, C, K, S. All new? And avoids A, R, N, E.

 Or ""LOCUS"": L-O-C-U-S -> but C is at position 3? Then U and S. But U is a vowel? And S is common.

 However, we know C is in the word, so we include it.

 Given the above, I think ""PICKS"" or ""BLOCK"" are both acceptable.

 Alternatively, since we haven't tested S and T, which are very common, let's try to include S.

 How about ""MUSIC"": M-U-S-I-C -> C at position 5? We get to test M, U, S, I, and C at the end.

 But U is less common? Or S and M are common.

 Another word: ""COSHY"" - not common.

 I think ""MUSIC"" might be a good candidate: it has common letters M, S, and vowels U, I.

 Let me decide: 

 Option 1: ""BLOCK"" -> B, L, O, C, K
 Option 2: ""PICKS"" -> P, I, C, K, S
 Option 3: ""MUSIC"" -> M, U, S, I, C

 Which one tests more common letters? 

 Common consonants: S, T, L, etc. So ""PICKS"" has P, C, K, S. ""BLOCK"" has B, L, C, K. ""MUSIC"" has M, S, C.

 Among vowels: O in ""BLOCK"", I in ""PICKS"", U and I in ""MUSIC"".

 We might prefer a word without repeating common letters? Actually, all distinct.

 I think ""PICKS"" is a good choice because it has S at the end and K which is common.

 But note: we have not tested T? Maybe we should leave T for now? We can test it next time.

 Alternatively, let's choose a word that includes T? But we can test T later.

 Since we are at the second guess and we have to include C, I'll go with ""PICKS"".

 Another word: ""CHINK"" -> but C at first? avoid.

 No: ""CHINK"" starts with C, which we must not do because we know C is not in position 1.

 Therefore, I'll choose ""PICKS"".

 Let me see: P-I-C-K-S

 If the word has C in position 3, we get a ✓ for C? Or if it's elsewhere, we get a -.

 Similarly, we see if P, I, K, S are present.

 Now, write the guess.

 But note: we are allowed any valid English word. ""PICKS"" is a valid word (it is the plural of pick).

 So I'll go with ""PICKS"".

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: crane -> C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
 Interpretation:
  - C is in the word but not in the first position (since it's marked with - meaning wrong position)
  - R, A, N, E are not in the word at all (marked with x)

 Since C is present but not in the first position, it must be in one of positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
 Also, we know that R, A, N, E are absent.

 For the next guess, we should try to include the letter C in a different position and use other common letters that haven't been tried yet.

 Letters we have tried: C, R, A, N, E (so avoid R, A, N, E)
 We know C is in the word, so we must include it again but not at the start.

 We also want to test new letters. Some common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y
 Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)

 We need a 5-letter word that includes C (not in the first position) and avoids R, A, N, E.

 Possibilities: Let's think of words with C in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

 Since we have no information about other letters, we can try to cover more common letters.

 For example, we can try words where C is in the second position? But note: we don't know the position yet.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with C in a different position and introduce new vowels and consonants.

 Considering common letters: S, T, L, O are very common.

 Example words:
   - Could try ""COULD"": but note we have U and O (vowels we haven't tried) and C is at the start? But wait, our feedback says C is not in the first position? Actually, it's possible that C is in the first position? Let's reexamine the feedback.

 Feedback: C(-) -> the C is in the word but not in the first position? Actually, the feedback symbol (-) means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. Since we placed C at position 1, and it's wrong position, that means the word does not have C at position 1, but C is elsewhere.

 So we cannot put C at position 1 again.

 We can try placing C at position 2? Or position 3, etc.

 Let's try to choose a word that has C in position 2? For example, ""SCENT"" but S is new, C in second, E is known absent -> but we know E is absent? Yes, because feedback for E was x. So we must avoid E.

 Therefore, ""SCENT"" has E which is bad.

 Another word: ""CLOUD"" -> C at position 2? Let's see: C-L-O-U-D. But O and U are untested vowels.

 However, note: we must exclude R,A,N,E. So ""CLOUD"" doesn't contain any of these excluded letters.

 But we have the letter C in position 2, which is new. We can use that to test.

 However, note: we also want to cover more common letters. An alternative word could be ""SLICK"" or ""CHECK"" but CHECK has two E's which we know are absent.

 How about ""PICKY"": P-I-C-K-Y -> here C is in position 3. But it has I and Y as vowels? And avoids the bad letters.

 But maybe we can do better? Let's try to cover more common consonants.

 Another idea: ""MUSIC"" -> M-U-S-I-C. This has C at the end (position 5). Also, it introduces M, U, S, I. S and T are very common, but it doesn't have T.

 Alternatively, ""TOPIC"": T-O-P-I-C -> T at start, C at end. But O and I are vowels we haven't tried.

 We want to maximize the chance of hitting the word and getting more information.

 Given that we know only one letter so far (C) and it's somewhere but not at position 1.

 Let's try ""SLICE"": S-L-I-C-E -> but E is absent, so we cannot use E. So avoid.

 How about ""SPICY"": S-P-I-C-Y -> letters: S, P, I, C, Y. This seems good because:
   - C is in position 4 (which is different from position 1, so we test a new position)
   - We test S, P, I, Y (vowel I and consonant S,P,Y)
   - Avoids R,A,N,E.

 But wait, we have Y? That might be less common.

 Another word: ""PITCH"": P-I-T-C-H -> C at position 4? Actually, P-I-T-C-H: C is at position 4? Positions: P(1), I(2), T(3), C(4), H(5). So C is at 4. And we avoid forbidden letters.

 However, note: no E, R, A, N? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""CRISP"": but C is at first, but we know C is not at first? So we cannot put C at first. Therefore, ""CRISP"" is invalid because we have C at first which is known wrong.

 How about ""CHIPS"": C is at first? So that's bad.

 We need C not at first. Let me think of words starting with another letter and having C in position 2 or later.

 Other possibilities: ""BLOCK"" -> B-L-O-C-K. C is at position 4? We avoid R,A,N,E. Letters: B, L, O, C, K. These are all new and common.

 Similarly, ""CLOCK"": C at first? -> Oh, C is at first. Avoid.

 So ""BLOCK"": B(1), L(2), O(3), C(4), K(5). C is at position 4. This seems acceptable.

 But note: we are allowed to try letters that have been marked absent? Actually, we know R,A,N,E are absent so we must avoid them. For letters that are present (like C) we must include them? Not necessarily: we are allowed to guess words without C? But since we know C is in the word, it would be inefficient to ignore that information. We should include C to try to locate it.

 Therefore, we must include C and avoid R,A,N,E.

 So words: ""BLOCK"", ""STOCK"" (but O is a vowel), ""STICK"" (I vowel), etc.

 I think ""BLOCK"" is a reasonable choice? But let me check the commonality.

 Alternatively, ""MUCKY"" - not very common.

 Let me choose ""BLOCK"": B, L, O, C, K.

 We test:
   - B at position 1: if it is in the word and if correct or not.
   - L at 2
   - O at 3
   - C at 4: we know C is in the word so we expect it to be marked either (-) or (✓). If it's not position 4, then we get (-) meaning it's elsewhere (and we know it's not position 1 from previous feedback, so then in positions 2,3,5? But we have positions: 1 is B so then 2,3,5). But we are testing L at 2, O at 3, and K at 5. So if we get feedback on C at 4, it may be correct or move.

 However, note: we have only 5 tries left? Actually, we used one, so 5 left? But we are at the second guess.

 But to be safe, let's try a word that has more new letters and also includes C.

 Another common word: ""CHAMP"" but C at first? avoid.

 ""PACKS"": P-A-C-K-S -> but A is absent? We know A is absent from the first feedback? Wait, no: in the first feedback, A was marked with x, so absent. So we must avoid A. So ""PACKS"" is invalid because it has A.

 ""PICKS"": P-I-C-K-S -> C is at position 3. That might be better because we don't know about position 3? So that's a good test.

 But ""PICKS"" has P, I, C, K, S. All new? And avoids A, R, N, E.

 Or ""LOCUS"": L-O-C-U-S -> but C is at position 3? Then U and S. But U is a vowel? And S is common.

 However, we know C is in the word, so we include it.

 Given the above, I think ""PICKS"" or ""BLOCK"" are both acceptable.

 Alternatively, since we haven't tested S and T, which are very common, let's try to include S.

 How about ""MUSIC"": M-U-S-I-C -> C at position 5? We get to test M, U, S, I, and C at the end.

 But U is less common? Or S and M are common.

 Another word: ""COSHY"" - not common.

 I think ""MUSIC"" might be a good candidate: it has common letters M, S, and vowels U, I.

 Let me decide: 

 Option 1: ""BLOCK"" -> B, L, O, C, K
 Option 2: ""PICKS"" -> P, I, C, K, S
 Option 3: ""MUSIC"" -> M, U, S, I, C

 Which one tests more common letters? 

 Common consonants: S, T, L, etc. So ""PICKS"" has P, C, K, S. ""BLOCK"" has B, L, C, K. ""MUSIC"" has M, S, C.

 Among vowels: O in ""BLOCK"", I in ""PICKS"", U and I in ""MUSIC"".

 We might prefer a word without repeating common letters? Actually, all distinct.

 I think ""PICKS"" is a good choice because it has S at the end and K which is common.

 But note: we have not tested T? Maybe we should leave T for now? We can test it next time.

 Alternatively, let's choose a word that includes T? But we can test T later.

 Since we are at the second guess and we have to include C, I'll go with ""PICKS"".

 Another word: ""CHINK"" -> but C at first? avoid.

 No: ""CHINK"" starts with C, which we must not do because we know C is not in position 1.

 Therefore, I'll choose ""PICKS"".

 Let me see: P-I-C-K-S

 If the word has C in position 3, we get a ✓ for C? Or if it's elsewhere, we get a -.

 Similarly, we see if P, I, K, S are present.

 Now, write the guess.

 But note: we are allowed any valid English word. ""PICKS"" is a valid word (it is the plural of pick).

 So I'll go with ""PICKS"".

<guess>picks</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C is present but not in position 1 (marked `-`)  
- R, A, N, E are absent (marked `x`)  

For the next guess:  
- Include C (since it exists in the word), but avoid positions 1 and the absent letters R, A, N, E.  
- Prioritize new common letters like S, T, L, O, I to maximize information.  
- Choose a word with C in a position not yet tested (positions 2–5).  

Selected ""picks"" because:  
- C is in position 3 (avoiding position 1).  
- Introduces new common consonants (P, K, S) and vowel (I).  
- Avoids R, A, N, E.  
- Tests potential placements for C while probing additional common letters.

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. crane: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x) -> C is in the word but not in position 1; R,A,N,E absent.
2. picks: P(x) I(-) C(-) K(-) S(x) -> I, C, K are in the word but in wrong positions; P and S are absent.

From guess 1, we know:
- C is present and not in position 1.
- R, A, N, E are absent.

From guess 2:
- I is present but not in position 2? Wait, in ""picks"":
  - Position 1: P -> x (absent)
  - Position 2: I -> - (in word, wrong position)
  - Position 3: C -> - (in word, wrong position) -> note: earlier we knew C wasn't in position 1, but now it's not in position 3 either? Actually, the feedback tells us C is present but not in position 3 (or 1, from before).
  - Position 4: K -> - (in word, wrong position)
  - Position 5: S -> x (absent)

So combining:
- Letters in the word: C, I, K (and we already knew C). Also note that I and K are new information.
- Absent letters: R, A, N, E, P, S.

Known positions:
- C cannot be in pos 1 (from first guess) or pos 3 (from second guess).
- I cannot be in pos 2.
- K cannot be in pos 4.

The secret word has 5 letters. We know it contains C, I, K, and one more letter we haven't guessed? Since we have three confirmed letters (C, I, K), there must be two more letters we haven't identified yet.

Let me list:
- Confirmed present: C, I, K (three letters)
- So the word has two more letters? But we have five positions. So we need exactly two more letters that haven't been guessed.

And we know the absent letters: R, A, N, E, P, S. So the remaining letters must be from the alphabet excluding these.

Available letters: 
Alphabet minus R, A, N, E, P, S -> available: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we have two more letters to find, and we know three: C, I, K.

So the word must consist of C, I, K, and two new letters (distinct? possibly, but not necessarily).

Now, constraints on positions:
- Positions available for C: not 1 or 3 -> can be 2,4,5? Because it has to be in one of the other positions.

Similarly for I: not 2 -> can be 1,3,4,5? But note, position 1 is available? Yes.

And for K: not 4 -> can be 1,2,3,5.

But also, the two new letters will occupy the remaining positions.

How to form a word?

We need to choose a word that:
- Contains C, I, K (all three)
- And two letters from the available letters (B,D,F,G,H,J,L,M,O,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z)
- And also avoids placing C in positions 1 or 3, I in position 2, and K in position 4.

Moreover, C must be in either 2,4, or 5? Actually, from the feedbacks:
From ""crane"", C not in 1 -> possible positions: 2,3,4,5? But wait, in ""picks"", C was in position 3 and marked as wrong position -> so C is not in 3. Therefore C cannot be in position 1 or 3 -> so positions 2,4,5.

Similarly, I cannot be in position 2? Actually, in ""picks"", I was in position 2 and marked wrong -> so I is not in position 2. But can be in 1,3,4,5? And K cannot be in 4 -> so K can be in 1,2,3,5.

So let me think about possible placements.

We must form a real word.

We also note that in the word, the positions for C,I,K must be such that they don't conflict.

For our next guess, we should include C, I, K and two new letters. We need to choose new letters that are common so we maximize information or guess the word.

Let me try to think of words with these letters.

Consider the letters: C, I, K and two more.

Possibly, since we want common letters? Let's look for words that contain C, I, K.

For example, ""THICK"": 
- T and H are new? And letters: T,H,I,C,K.
- Check positions: 
  - If we guess ""THICK"":
    - T at 1: T is new -> could be?
    - H at 2: H is new.
    - I at position 3: but in our constraints, I cannot be in position 2? But it can be in 3? Yes, no constraint against position 3 for I? Only position 2 is forbidden for I? Correct.
    - C at 4: which is allowed? Because C can be in 4? But we have constraint for C: not 1 or 3, so 4 is ok? But also want to test if this position is right.
    - K at 5: which is allowed? Because K can be in 5? And constraint: K not in 4, so 5 is ok? Yes.

But let's see if the letters are acceptable: T and H are not absent? They haven't been tested before? So yes.

Another word: ""CLICK"" -> but L is new? Also C at position 1? Wait, ""CLICK"": C at position 1 -> but we know C cannot be position 1? Feedback from first guess said C(-) meaning it is in the word but not position 1? So we cannot choose a word that starts with C. Therefore, ""CLICK"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""KICK"" is only 4 letters? So no.

Another common word: ""BRICK"" -> B and R? But R is absent? From first guess: R(x) so absent. So cannot use R. Therefore invalid.

How about ""THICK""? As above.

Or ""MAGIC"" -> but has A which is absent? A is absent? So no.

Another: ""MUSIC"" -> but has S? And we know S is absent? From second guess: S(x) so not present. So ""MUSIC"" contains S, which is absent? So not allowed? Because we must use only present letters? No: we must not use absent letters? Actually, in the rules, we have to guess words that use English words, but we should avoid letters that are absent? Because they are not in the word? Yes, by previous feedback.

So in our guess, we should avoid letters known to be absent: R,A,N,E,P,S.

Therefore, ""THICK"": letter T and H are not absent? And the word has T,H,I,C,K.

Check:
- T: not yet tested? Ok.
- H: not tested? Ok.
- I,C,K: are present? Yes.

And positions: 
- Position 1: T? Could be, since we don't know what's in position 1.
- Position 2: H? Could be.
- Position 3: I -> this position is allowed? I can be in position 3? Yes.
- Position 4: C -> allowed? Because C can be in 4? Yes, not forbidden.
- Position 5: K -> allowed? Because K can be in 5? Yes.

So ""THICK"" might work? But let's see if there are constraints we missed? 

Also, we need to verify that this matches existing feedback? Our guess should be consistent with previous feedback? No, we are making a new guess that may or may not be consistent? Actually, we don't require consistency? We are trying to solve.

But to be efficient, we can consider if there are better words? For example, a word that might cover more new letters.

But ""THICK"" introduces two new letters: T and H. T is very common? Yes.

Another possibility: ""QUICK"" -> but Q is hard? And U is a vowel? Also, U is new? So letters Q,U,I,C,K. But we avoid absent letters? And Q,U not absent? But Q might be less effective? Because if we use Q and it's not present, we lose information? But we have only four guesses left? We should prioritize common letters.

I think ""THICK"" is reasonable.

Alternatively, with different letters: ""CHICK"" -> C at first? Wait, ""CHICK"": C is first? That would be invalid? So no.

Or ""DICK"" - but 4 letters? No.

Another word: ""WICK"" - also 4 letters? 

Or ""COVET"" but then missing I and K? We must include all three: C, I, K.

Because they are known to be in the word? Actually, we are required to include only English words, but if we don't include I and K, it would not be efficient? Because we know they are present? Yes, so we should include them to get positional information.

Therefore, we must include C, I, K? Because we have limited tries? And they are confirmed.

So back to words containing C, I, K? And two other letters from available.

Another word: ""VICKY"" - but we have Y? Also, it has double letters? Specifically, Y is acceptable? But ""VICKY"" is not a common word? It might be a name? But we need English words? So assume standard Wordle dictionary.

I think ""THICK"" is more standard.

Alternatively, ""CLINK"" -> but L and N? But N is absent? So no.

""BLINK"" -> no, same issue? N absent? And also, we don't have I and K? Wait, ""BLINK"" has I and K? And C? No, no C? It has B,L,I,N,K? But N is absent? So invalid.

Perhaps ""FLICK"" -> but F,L,I,C,K? Position: F(1), L(2), I(3), C(4), K(5) -> avoids absent letters: no R,A,N,E,P,S? So F and L are new.

But C at 4? We allow? Yes. I at 3? Allowed? Yes. K at 5? Allowed? Yes.

Similarly, ""FLICK"" is a valid word? Meaning to flick something.

Or ""CLICK"" is not possible? Because C first? No.

But we remember: ""THICK"" and ""FLICK"" are both possibilities.

Or ""TRICK"" -> T,R,I,C,K? But R is absent? So invalid.

So ""THICK"" or ""FLICK""?

What about ""CHINK""? But H and N? N absent? No.

Now, let me check commonality? Or maybe we can use a word that includes a vowel? Both have vowels? T, H are consonants? Or in ""THICK"", H is a consonant? But we haven't tested vowels? Actually, the only vowel in our word so far is I? And we know the absent vowels: A,E? So vowels O,U,Y might be present? Or not?

We need vowels: the secret word must have vowels? Since it is English? So possible vowels: O,U,Y? Or I is the only vowel? But we know I is present? So it might have another vowel?

So in our guess, we might prefer a word that tests a vowel? If we haven't tested any other vowels? For instance, we haven't tested O,U,Y.

In ""THICK"", there is only I? So it might not reveal any new vowel? Similarly ""FLICK""? Both have only I as vowel? Which is good? Because it has the vowel I we know.

But we also need to cover more letters? Maybe not necessary? 

Another word: ""OUNCE"" but E absent? No? So cannot.

Or ""COUCH"" but C at first? And no I or K? So not.

I think ""THICK"" is fine? Or choose ""FLICK""?

Let me check the possibility: We need words that have C,I,K and two from available? Now, we must avoid absent letters: R,A,N,E,P,S.

So for our list: let me suggest ""THICK"" or ""FLICK"".

But note: if we guess ""THICK"", then:
- If the word is not ""THICK"", we might get feedback that helps.

Similarly, ""FLICK""?

I think both are valid? But let me see which covers more common letters? T and H vs F and L? T is more common? So ""THICK"" might be better? Because T is very common.

Similarly, we can also consider the positions: in ""THICK"", we have:
- C at position 4? If the secret word has C at position 4? Then we get correct? But if not, at least we test.

Now, let me think about other words? 

Another candidate: ""DOCH"" -> too short? 

Or ""QUICK"" with Q and U? Which are less common? But Q is rare? So might be inefficient.

""WHISK"" -> but has H,I,S,K? But S is absent? So invalid.

Therefore, I'll choose ""THICK"".

So <guess>thick</guess>

But note: the word ""THICK"" spells T-H-I-C-K? Letters: T, H, I, C, K? Yes.

And we include C,I,K? And T,H which are new and not absent? Also, positions: 
1: T (could be present or not? We'll see)
2: H (same)
3: I? We know I is present, but not position 2? Now we test position 3? And C at position 4? Which is possible? And K at 5? Which is possible.

So it's a valid guess.

Therefore, I'll go with ""THICK"".

But let's double-check against constraints:
- Avoid absent letters: R,A,N,E,P,S -> ""THICK"" has T,H,I,C,K -> no problem? T and H are allowed? Because not yet known as absent? Yes.
- Positions: I at 3: which is allowed? (since I cannot be at position 2? But position 3 is ok) -> yes.
- C at position 4: allowed? (since C cannot be at 1 or 3? Position 4 is allowed? Yes) -> yes.
- K at position 5: allowed? (K cannot be at 4? Position 5 is allowed? Yes) -> yes.

So all good.

Thus, the guess is ""THICK"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first two guesses:

1. **crane**: C is present (wrong position), confirming C is in the word but not position 1. R, A, N, E are absent.
2. **picks**: I, C, K are present but all in wrong positions (I not position 2, C not position 3, K not position 4). P and S are absent.

Key deductions:
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: C, I, K (all must appear in the next guess).
- **Absent letters**: R, A, N, E, P, S (must avoid these in the new guess).
- **Position constraints**:
  - C cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (must be in 2, 4, or 5).
  - I cannot be in position 2 (must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5).
  - K cannot be in position 4 (must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- The word must include two additional letters from the remaining available alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

For the next guess, a word must incorporate C, I, K and introduce two new letters to maximize information. The word **thick** was selected because:
- It includes C (position 4, allowed), I (position 3, allowed), and K (position 5, allowed).
- It introduces T and H, common consonants not yet tested.
- It avoids all absent letters (R, A, N, E, P, S).
- As a valid English word, it tests new letters while respecting position constraints.

<guess>thick</guess>",thick,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. crane: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x) -> C is in the word but not in position 1; R,A,N,E absent.
2. picks: P(x) I(-) C(-) K(-) S(x) -> I, C, K are in the word but in wrong positions; P and S are absent.

From guess 1, we know:
- C is present and not in position 1.
- R, A, N, E are absent.

From guess 2:
- I is present but not in position 2? Wait, in ""picks"":
  - Position 1: P -> x (absent)
  - Position 2: I -> - (in word, wrong position)
  - Position 3: C -> - (in word, wrong position) -> note: earlier we knew C wasn't in position 1, but now it's not in position 3 either? Actually, the feedback tells us C is present but not in position 3 (or 1, from before).
  - Position 4: K -> - (in word, wrong position)
  - Position 5: S -> x (absent)

So combining:
- Letters in the word: C, I, K (and we already knew C). Also note that I and K are new information.
- Absent letters: R, A, N, E, P, S.

Known positions:
- C cannot be in pos 1 (from first guess) or pos 3 (from second guess).
- I cannot be in pos 2.
- K cannot be in pos 4.

The secret word has 5 letters. We know it contains C, I, K, and one more letter we haven't guessed? Since we have three confirmed letters (C, I, K), there must be two more letters we haven't identified yet.

Let me list:
- Confirmed present: C, I, K (three letters)
- So the word has two more letters? But we have five positions. So we need exactly two more letters that haven't been guessed.

And we know the absent letters: R, A, N, E, P, S. So the remaining letters must be from the alphabet excluding these.

Available letters: 
Alphabet minus R, A, N, E, P, S -> available: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we have two more letters to find, and we know three: C, I, K.

So the word must consist of C, I, K, and two new letters (distinct? possibly, but not necessarily).

Now, constraints on positions:
- Positions available for C: not 1 or 3 -> can be 2,4,5? Because it has to be in one of the other positions.

Similarly for I: not 2 -> can be 1,3,4,5? But note, position 1 is available? Yes.

And for K: not 4 -> can be 1,2,3,5.

But also, the two new letters will occupy the remaining positions.

How to form a word?

We need to choose a word that:
- Contains C, I, K (all three)
- And two letters from the available letters (B,D,F,G,H,J,L,M,O,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z)
- And also avoids placing C in positions 1 or 3, I in position 2, and K in position 4.

Moreover, C must be in either 2,4, or 5? Actually, from the feedbacks:
From ""crane"", C not in 1 -> possible positions: 2,3,4,5? But wait, in ""picks"", C was in position 3 and marked as wrong position -> so C is not in 3. Therefore C cannot be in position 1 or 3 -> so positions 2,4,5.

Similarly, I cannot be in position 2? Actually, in ""picks"", I was in position 2 and marked wrong -> so I is not in position 2. But can be in 1,3,4,5? And K cannot be in 4 -> so K can be in 1,2,3,5.

So let me think about possible placements.

We must form a real word.

We also note that in the word, the positions for C,I,K must be such that they don't conflict.

For our next guess, we should include C, I, K and two new letters. We need to choose new letters that are common so we maximize information or guess the word.

Let me try to think of words with these letters.

Consider the letters: C, I, K and two more.

Possibly, since we want common letters? Let's look for words that contain C, I, K.

For example, ""THICK"": 
- T and H are new? And letters: T,H,I,C,K.
- Check positions: 
  - If we guess ""THICK"":
    - T at 1: T is new -> could be?
    - H at 2: H is new.
    - I at position 3: but in our constraints, I cannot be in position 2? But it can be in 3? Yes, no constraint against position 3 for I? Only position 2 is forbidden for I? Correct.
    - C at 4: which is allowed? Because C can be in 4? But we have constraint for C: not 1 or 3, so 4 is ok? But also want to test if this position is right.
    - K at 5: which is allowed? Because K can be in 5? And constraint: K not in 4, so 5 is ok? Yes.

But let's see if the letters are acceptable: T and H are not absent? They haven't been tested before? So yes.

Another word: ""CLICK"" -> but L is new? Also C at position 1? Wait, ""CLICK"": C at position 1 -> but we know C cannot be position 1? Feedback from first guess said C(-) meaning it is in the word but not position 1? So we cannot choose a word that starts with C. Therefore, ""CLICK"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""KICK"" is only 4 letters? So no.

Another common word: ""BRICK"" -> B and R? But R is absent? From first guess: R(x) so absent. So cannot use R. Therefore invalid.

How about ""THICK""? As above.

Or ""MAGIC"" -> but has A which is absent? A is absent? So no.

Another: ""MUSIC"" -> but has S? And we know S is absent? From second guess: S(x) so not present. So ""MUSIC"" contains S, which is absent? So not allowed? Because we must use only present letters? No: we must not use absent letters? Actually, in the rules, we have to guess words that use English words, but we should avoid letters that are absent? Because they are not in the word? Yes, by previous feedback.

So in our guess, we should avoid letters known to be absent: R,A,N,E,P,S.

Therefore, ""THICK"": letter T and H are not absent? And the word has T,H,I,C,K.

Check:
- T: not yet tested? Ok.
- H: not tested? Ok.
- I,C,K: are present? Yes.

And positions: 
- Position 1: T? Could be, since we don't know what's in position 1.
- Position 2: H? Could be.
- Position 3: I -> this position is allowed? I can be in position 3? Yes.
- Position 4: C -> allowed? Because C can be in 4? Yes, not forbidden.
- Position 5: K -> allowed? Because K can be in 5? Yes.

So ""THICK"" might work? But let's see if there are constraints we missed? 

Also, we need to verify that this matches existing feedback? Our guess should be consistent with previous feedback? No, we are making a new guess that may or may not be consistent? Actually, we don't require consistency? We are trying to solve.

Perhaps ""FLICK"" -> but F,L,I,C,K? Position: F(1), L(2), I(3), C(4), K(5) -> avoids absent letters: no R,A,N,E,P,S? So F and L are new.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,flick,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: crane -> C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
 Interpretation:
  - C is in the word but not in the first position (since it's marked with - meaning wrong position)
  - R, A, N, E are not in the word at all (marked with x)

 Since C is present but not in the first position, it must be in one of positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
 Also, we know that R, A, N, E are absent.

 For the next guess, we should try to include the letter C in a different position and use other common letters that haven't been tried yet.

 Letters we have tried: C, R, A, N, E (so avoid R, A, N, E)
 We know C is in the word, so we must include it again but not at the start.

 We also want to test new letters. Some common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y
 Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)

 We need a 5-letter word that includes C (not in the first position) and avoids R, A, N, E.

 Possibilities: Let's think of words with C in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

 Since we have no information about other letters, we can try to cover more common letters.

 For example, we can try words where C is in the second position? But note: we don't know the position yet.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with C in a different position and introduce new vowels and consonants.

 Considering common letters: S, T, L, O are very common.

 Example words:
   - Could try ""COULD"": but note we have U and O (vowels we haven't tried) and C is at the start? But wait, our feedback says C is not in the first position? Actually, it's possible that C is in the first position? Let's reexamine the feedback.

 Feedback: C(-) -> the C is in the word but not in the first position? Actually, the feedback symbol (-) means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. Since we placed C at position 1, and it's wrong position, that means the word does not have C at position 1, but C is elsewhere.

 So we cannot put C at position 1 again.

 We can try placing C at position 2? Or position 3, etc.

 Let's try to choose a word that has C in position 2? For example, ""SCENT"" but S is new, C in second, E is known absent -> but we know E is absent? Yes, because feedback for E was x. So we must avoid E.

 Therefore, ""SCENT"" has E which is bad.

 Another word: ""CLOUD"" -> C at position 2? Let's see: C-L-O-U-D. But O and U are untested vowels.

 However, note: we must exclude R,A,N,E. So ""CLOUD"" doesn't contain any of these excluded letters.

 But we have the letter C in position 2, which is new. We can use that to test.

 However, note: we also want to cover more common letters. An alternative word could be ""SLICK"" or ""CHECK"" but CHECK has two E's which we know are absent.

 How about ""PICKY"": P-I-C-K-Y -> here C is in position 3. But it has I and Y as vowels? And avoids the bad letters.

 But maybe we can do better? Let's try to cover more common consonants.

 Another idea: ""MUSIC"" -> M-U-S-I-C. This has C at the end (position 5). Also, it introduces M, U, S, I. S and T are very common, but it doesn't have T.

 Alternatively, ""TOPIC"": T-O-P-I-C -> T at start, C at end. But O and I are vowels we haven't tried.

 We want to maximize the chance of hitting the word and getting more information.

 Given that we know only one letter so far (C) and it's somewhere but not at position 1.

 Let's try ""SLICE"": S-L-I-C-E -> but E is absent, so we cannot use E. So avoid.

 How about ""SPICY"": S-P-I-C-Y -> letters: S, P, I, C, Y. This seems good because:
   - C is in position 4 (which is different from position 1, so we test a new position)
   - We test S, P, I, Y (vowel I and consonant S,P,Y)
   - Avoids R,A,N,E.

 But wait, we have Y? That might be less common.

 Another word: ""PITCH"": P-I-T-C-H -> C at position 4? Actually, P-I-T-C-H: C is at position 4? Positions: P(1), I(2), T(3), C(4), H(5). So C is at 4. And we avoid forbidden letters.

 However, note: no E, R, A, N? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""CRISP"": but C is at first, but we know C is not at first? So we cannot put C at first. Therefore, ""CRISP"" is invalid because we have C at first which is known wrong.

 How about ""CHIPS"": C is at first? So that's bad.

 We need C not at first. Let me think of words starting with another letter and having C in position 2 or later.

 Other possibilities: ""BLOCK"" -> B-L-O-C-K. C is at position 4? We avoid R,A,N,E. Letters: B, L, O, C, K. These are all new and common.

 Similarly, ""CLOCK"": C at first? -> Oh, C is at first. Avoid.

 So ""BLOCK"": B(1), L(2), O(3), C(4), K(5). C is at position 4. This seems acceptable.

 But note: we are allowed to try letters that have been marked absent? Actually, we know R,A,N,E are absent so we must avoid them. For letters that are present (like C) we must include them? Not necessarily: we are allowed to guess words without C? But since we know C is in the word, it would be inefficient to ignore that information. We should include C to try to locate it.

 Therefore, we must include C and avoid R,A,N,E.

 So words: ""BLOCK"", ""STOCK"" (but O is a vowel), ""STICK"" (I vowel), etc.

 I think ""BLOCK"" is a reasonable choice? But let me check the commonality.

 Alternatively, ""MUCKY"" - not very common.

 Let me choose ""BLOCK"": B, L, O, C, K.

 We test:
   - B at position 1: if it is in the word and if correct or not.
   - L at 2
   - O at 3
   - C at 4: we know C is in the word so we expect it to be marked either (-) or (✓). If it's not position 4, then we get (-) meaning it's elsewhere (and we know it's not position 1 from previous feedback, so then in positions 2,3,5? But we have positions: 1 is B so then 2,3,5). But we are testing L at 2, O at 3, and K at 5. So if we get feedback on C at 4, it may be correct or move.

 However, note: we have only 5 tries left? Actually, we used one, so 5 left? But we are at the second guess.

 But to be safe, let's try a word that has more new letters and also includes C.

 Another common word: ""CHAMP"" but C at first? avoid.

 ""PACKS"": P-A-C-K-S -> but A is absent? We know A is absent from the first feedback? Wait, no: in the first feedback, A was marked with x, so absent. So we must avoid A. So ""PACKS"" is invalid because it has A.

 ""PICKS"": P-I-C-K-S -> C is at position 3. That might be better because we don't know about position 3? So that's a good test.

 But ""PICKS"" has P, I, C, K, S. All new? And avoids A, R, N, E.

 Or ""LOCUS"": L-O-C-U-S -> but C is at position 3? Then U and S. But U is a vowel? And S is common.

 However, we know C is in the word, so we include it.

 Given the above, I think ""PICKS"" or ""BLOCK"" are both acceptable.

 Alternatively, since we haven't tested S and T, which are very common, let's try to include S.

 How about ""MUSIC"": M-U-S-I-C -> C at position 5? We get to test M, U, S, I, and C at the end.

 But U is less common? Or S and M are common.

 Another word: ""COSHY"" - not common.

 I think ""MUSIC"" might be a good candidate: it has common letters M, S, and vowels U, I.

 Let me decide: 

 Option 1: ""BLOCK"" -> B, L, O, C, K
 Option 2: ""PICKS"" -> P, I, C, K, S
 Option 3: ""MUSIC"" -> M, U, S, I, C

 Which one tests more common letters? 

 Common consonants: S, T, L, etc. So ""PICKS"" has P, C, K, S. ""BLOCK"" has B, L, C, K. ""MUSIC"" has M, S, C.

 Among vowels: O in ""BLOCK"", I in ""PICKS"", U and I in ""MUSIC"".

 We might prefer a word without repeating common letters? Actually, all distinct.

 I think ""PICKS"" is a good choice because it has S at the end and K which is common.

 But note: we have not tested T? Maybe we should leave T for now? We can test it next time.

 Alternatively, let's choose a word that includes T? But we can test T later.

 Since we are at the second guess and we have to include C, I'll go with ""PICKS"".

 Another word: ""CHINK"" -> but C at first? avoid.

 No: ""CHINK"" starts with C, which we must not do because we know C is not in position 1.

 Therefore, I'll choose ""PICKS"".

 Let me see: P-I-C-K-S

 If the word has C in position 3, we get a ✓ for C? Or if it's elsewhere, we get a -.

 Similarly, we see if P, I, K, S are present.

 Now, write the guess.

 But note: we are allowed any valid English word. ""PICKS"" is a valid word (it is the plural of pick).

 So I'll go with ""PICKS"".

<guess>picks</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C is present but not in position 1 (marked `-`)  
- R, A, N, E are absent (marked `x`)  

For the next guess:  
- Include C (since it exists in the word), but avoid positions 1 and the absent letters R, A, N, E.  
- Prioritize new common letters like S, T, L, O, I to maximize information.  
- Choose a word with C in a position not yet tested (positions 2–5).  

Selected ""picks"" because:  
- C is in position 3 (avoiding position 1).  
- Introduces new common consonants (P, K, S) and vowel (I).  
- Avoids R, A, N, E.  
- Tests potential placements for C while probing additional common letters.

<guess>picks</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: picks -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(-) C(-) K(-) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. crane: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x) -> C is in the word but not in position 1; R,A,N,E absent.
2. picks: P(x) I(-) C(-) K(-) S(x) -> I, C, K are in the word but in wrong positions; P and S are absent.

From guess 1, we know:
- C is present and not in position 1.
- R, A, N, E are absent.

From guess 2:
- I is present but not in position 2? Wait, in ""picks"":
  - Position 1: P -> x (absent)
  - Position 2: I -> - (in word, wrong position)
  - Position 3: C -> - (in word, wrong position) -> note: earlier we knew C wasn't in position 1, but now it's not in position 3 either? Actually, the feedback tells us C is present but not in position 3 (or 1, from before).
  - Position 4: K -> - (in word, wrong position)
  - Position 5: S -> x (absent)

So combining:
- Letters in the word: C, I, K (and we already knew C). Also note that I and K are new information.
- Absent letters: R, A, N, E, P, S.

Known positions:
- C cannot be in pos 1 (from first guess) or pos 3 (from second guess).
- I cannot be in pos 2.
- K cannot be in pos 4.

The secret word has 5 letters. We know it contains C, I, K, and one more letter we haven't guessed? Since we have three confirmed letters (C, I, K), there must be two more letters we haven't identified yet.

Let me list:
- Confirmed present: C, I, K (three letters)
- So the word has two more letters? But we have five positions. So we need exactly two more letters that haven't been guessed.

And we know the absent letters: R, A, N, E, P, S. So the remaining letters must be from the alphabet excluding these.

Available letters: 
Alphabet minus R, A, N, E, P, S -> available: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we have two more letters to find, and we know three: C, I, K.

So the word must consist of C, I, K, and two new letters (distinct? possibly, but not necessarily).

Now, constraints on positions:
- Positions available for C: not 1 or 3 -> can be 2,4,5? Because it has to be in one of the other positions.

Similarly for I: not 2 -> can be 1,3,4,5? But note, position 1 is available? Yes.

And for K: not 4 -> can be 1,2,3,5.

But also, the two new letters will occupy the remaining positions.

How to form a word?

We need to choose a word that:
- Contains C, I, K (all three)
- And two letters from the available letters (B,D,F,G,H,J,L,M,O,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z)
- And also avoids placing C in positions 1 or 3, I in position 2, and K in position 4.

Moreover, C must be in either 2,4, or 5? Actually, from the feedbacks:
From ""crane"", C not in 1 -> possible positions: 2,3,4,5? But wait, in ""picks"", C was in position 3 and marked as wrong position -> so C is not in 3. Therefore C cannot be in position 1 or 3 -> so positions 2,4,5.

Similarly, I cannot be in position 2? Actually, in ""picks"", I was in position 2 and marked wrong -> so I is not in position 2. But can be in 1,3,4,5? And K cannot be in 4 -> so K can be in 1,2,3,5.

So let me think about possible placements.

We must form a real word.

We also note that in the word, the positions for C,I,K must be such that they don't conflict.

For our next guess, we should include C, I, K and two new letters. We need to choose new letters that are common so we maximize information or guess the word.

Let me try to think of words with these letters.

Consider the letters: C, I, K and two more.

Possibly, since we want common letters? Let's look for words that contain C, I, K.

For example, ""THICK"": 
- T and H are new? And letters: T,H,I,C,K.
- Check positions: 
  - If we guess ""THICK"":
    - T at 1: T is new -> could be?
    - H at 2: H is new.
    - I at position 3: but in our constraints, I cannot be in position 2? But it can be in 3? Yes, no constraint against position 3 for I? Only position 2 is forbidden for I? Correct.
    - C at 4: which is allowed? Because C can be in 4? But we have constraint for C: not 1 or 3, so 4 is ok? But also want to test if this position is right.
    - K at 5: which is allowed? Because K can be in 5? And constraint: K not in 4, so 5 is ok? Yes.

But let's see if the letters are acceptable: T and H are not absent? They haven't been tested before? So yes.

Another word: ""CLICK"" -> but L is new? Also C at position 1? Wait, ""CLICK"": C at position 1 -> but we know C cannot be position 1? Feedback from first guess said C(-) meaning it is in the word but not position 1? So we cannot choose a word that starts with C. Therefore, ""CLICK"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""KICK"" is only 4 letters? So no.

Another common word: ""BRICK"" -> B and R? But R is absent? From first guess: R(x) so absent. So cannot use R. Therefore invalid.

How about ""THICK""? As above.

Or ""MAGIC"" -> but has A which is absent? A is absent? So no.

Another: ""MUSIC"" -> but has S? And we know S is absent? From second guess: S(x) so not present. So ""MUSIC"" contains S, which is absent? So not allowed? Because we must use only present letters? No: we must not use absent letters? Actually, in the rules, we have to guess words that use English words, but we should avoid letters that are absent? Because they are not in the word? Yes, by previous feedback.

So in our guess, we should avoid letters known to be absent: R,A,N,E,P,S.

Therefore, ""THICK"": letter T and H are not absent? And the word has T,H,I,C,K.

Check:
- T: not yet tested? Ok.
- H: not tested? Ok.
- I,C,K: are present? Yes.

And positions: 
- Position 1: T? Could be, since we don't know what's in position 1.
- Position 2: H? Could be.
- Position 3: I -> this position is allowed? I can be in position 3? Yes.
- Position 4: C -> allowed? Because C can be in 4? Yes, not forbidden.
- Position 5: K -> allowed? Because K can be in 5? Yes.

So ""THICK"" might work? But let's see if there are constraints we missed? 

Also, we need to verify that this matches existing feedback? Our guess should be consistent with previous feedback? No, we are making a new guess that may or may not be consistent? Actually, we don't require consistency? We are trying to solve.

But to be efficient, we can consider if there are better words? For example, a word that might cover more new letters.

But ""THICK"" introduces two new letters: T and H. T is very common? Yes.

Another possibility: ""QUICK"" -> but Q is hard? And U is a vowel? Also, U is new? So letters Q,U,I,C,K. But we avoid absent letters? And Q,U not absent? But Q might be less effective? Because if we use Q and it's not present, we lose information? But we have only four guesses left? We should prioritize common letters.

I think ""THICK"" is reasonable.

Alternatively, with different letters: ""CHICK"" -> C at first? Wait, ""CHICK"": C is first? That would be invalid? So no.

Or ""DICK"" - but 4 letters? No.

Another word: ""WICK"" - also 4 letters? 

Or ""COVET"" but then missing I and K? We must include all three: C, I, K.

Because they are known to be in the word? Actually, we are required to include only English words, but if we don't include I and K, it would not be efficient? Because we know they are present? Yes, so we should include them to get positional information.

Therefore, we must include C, I, K? Because we have limited tries? And they are confirmed.

So back to words containing C, I, K? And two other letters from available.

Another word: ""VICKY"" - but we have Y? Also, it has double letters? Specifically, Y is acceptable? But ""VICKY"" is not a common word? It might be a name? But we need English words? So assume standard Wordle dictionary.

I think ""THICK"" is more standard.

Alternatively, ""CLINK"" -> but L and N? But N is absent? So no.

""BLINK"" -> no, same issue? N absent? And also, we don't have I and K? Wait, ""BLINK"" has I and K? And C? No, no C? It has B,L,I,N,K? But N is absent? So invalid.

Perhaps ""FLICK"" -> but F,L,I,C,K? Position: F(1), L(2), I(3), C(4), K(5) -> avoids absent letters: no R,A,N,E,P,S? So F and L are new.

But C at 4? We allow? Yes. I at 3? Allowed? Yes. K at 5? Allowed? Yes.

Similarly, ""FLICK"" is a valid word? Meaning to flick something.

Or ""CLICK"" is not possible? Because C first? No.

But we remember: ""THICK"" and ""FLICK"" are both possibilities.

Or ""TRICK"" -> T,R,I,C,K? But R is absent? So invalid.

So ""THICK"" or ""FLICK""?

What about ""CHINK""? But H and N? N absent? No.

Now, let me check commonality? Or maybe we can use a word that includes a vowel? Both have vowels? T, H are consonants? Or in ""THICK"", H is a consonant? But we haven't tested vowels? Actually, the only vowel in our word so far is I? And we know the absent vowels: A,E? So vowels O,U,Y might be present? Or not?

We need vowels: the secret word must have vowels? Since it is English? So possible vowels: O,U,Y? Or I is the only vowel? But we know I is present? So it might have another vowel?

So in our guess, we might prefer a word that tests a vowel? If we haven't tested any other vowels? For instance, we haven't tested O,U,Y.

In ""THICK"", there is only I? So it might not reveal any new vowel? Similarly ""FLICK""? Both have only I as vowel? Which is good? Because it has the vowel I we know.

But we also need to cover more letters? Maybe not necessary? 

Another word: ""OUNCE"" but E absent? No? So cannot.

Or ""COUCH"" but C at first? And no I or K? So not.

I think ""THICK"" is fine? Or choose ""FLICK""?

Let me check the possibility: We need words that have C,I,K and two from available? Now, we must avoid absent letters: R,A,N,E,P,S.

So for our list: let me suggest ""THICK"" or ""FLICK"".

But note: if we guess ""THICK"", then:
- If the word is not ""THICK"", we might get feedback that helps.

Similarly, ""FLICK""?

I think both are valid? But let me see which covers more common letters? T and H vs F and L? T is more common? So ""THICK"" might be better? Because T is very common.

Similarly, we can also consider the positions: in ""THICK"", we have:
- C at position 4? If the secret word has C at position 4? Then we get correct? But if not, at least we test.

Now, let me think about other words? 

Another candidate: ""DOCH"" -> too short? 

Or ""QUICK"" with Q and U? Which are less common? But Q is rare? So might be inefficient.

""WHISK"" -> but has H,I,S,K? But S is absent? So invalid.

Therefore, I'll choose ""THICK"".

So <guess>thick</guess>

But note: the word ""THICK"" spells T-H-I-C-K? Letters: T, H, I, C, K? Yes.

And we include C,I,K? And T,H which are new and not absent? Also, positions: 
1: T (could be present or not? We'll see)
2: H (same)
3: I? We know I is present, but not position 2? Now we test position 3? And C at position 4? Which is possible? And K at 5? Which is possible.

So it's a valid guess.

Therefore, I'll go with ""THICK"".

But let's double-check against constraints:
- Avoid absent letters: R,A,N,E,P,S -> ""THICK"" has T,H,I,C,K -> no problem? T and H are allowed? Because not yet known as absent? Yes.
- Positions: I at 3: which is allowed? (since I cannot be at position 2? But position 3 is ok) -> yes.
- C at position 4: allowed? (since C cannot be at 1 or 3? Position 4 is allowed? Yes) -> yes.
- K at position 5: allowed? (K cannot be at 4? Position 5 is allowed? Yes) -> yes.

So all good.

Thus, the guess is ""THICK"".After analyzing the feedback from the first two guesses:

1. **crane**: C is present (wrong position), confirming C is in the word but not position 1. R, A, N, E are absent.
2. **picks**: I, C, K are present but all in wrong positions (I not position 2, C not position 3, K not position 4). P and S are absent.

Key deductions:
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: C, I, K (all must appear in the next guess).
- **Absent letters**: R, A, N, E, P, S (must avoid these in the new guess).
- **Position constraints**:
  - C cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (must be in 2, 4, or 5).
  - I cannot be in position 2 (must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5).
  - K cannot be in position 4 (must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- The word must include two additional letters from the remaining available alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

For the next guess, a word must incorporate C, I, K and introduce two new letters to maximize information. The word **thick** was selected because:
- It includes C (position 4, allowed), I (position 3, allowed), and K (position 5, allowed).
- It introduces T and H, common consonants not yet tested.
- It avoids all absent letters (R, A, N, E, P, S).
- As a valid English word, it tests new letters while respecting position constraints.

An alternative word could be ""SLICK"" or ""CHECK"" but CHECK has two E\'s which we know are absent.\n\n How about ""PICKY"": P-I-C-K-Y -> here C is in position 3. But it has I and Y as vowels? And avoids the bad letters.\n\n But maybe we can do better? Let\'s try to cover more common consonants.\n\n Another idea: ""MUSIC"" -> M-U-S-I-C. This has C at the end (position 5). Also, it introduces M, U, S, I. S and T are very common, but it doesn\'t have T.\n\n Alternatively, ""TOPIC"": T-O-P-I-C -> T at start, C at end. But O and I are vowels we haven\'t tried.\n\n We want to maximize the chance of hitting the word and getting more information.\n\n Given that we know only one letter so far (C) and it\'s somewhere but not at position 1.\n\n Let\'s try ""SLICE"": S-L-I-C-E -> but E is absent, so we cannot use E. So avoid.\n\n How about ""SPICY"": S-P-I-C-Y -> letters: S, P, I, C, Y. This seems good because:\n   - C is in position 4 (which is different from position 1, so we test a new position)\n   - We test S, P, I, Y (vowel I and consonant S,P,Y)\n   - Avoids R,A,N,E.\n\n But wait, we have Y? That might be less common.\n\n Another word: ""PITCH"": P-I-T-C-H -> C at position 4? Actually, P-I-T-C-H: C is at position 4? Positions: P(1), I(2), T(3), C(4), H(5). So C is at 4. And we avoid forbidden letters.\n\n However, note: no E, R, A, N? Yes.\n\n Alternatively, ""CRISP"": but C is at first, but we know C is not at first? So we cannot put C at first. Therefore, ""CRISP"" is invalid because we have C at first which is known wrong.\n\n How about ""CHIPS"": C is at first? So that\'s bad.\n\n We need C not at first. Let me think of words starting with another letter and having C in position 2 or later.\n\n Other possibilities: ""BLOCK"" -> B-L-O-C-K. C is at position 4? We avoid R,A,N,E. Letters: B, L, O, C, K. These are all new and common.\n\n Similarly, ""CLOCK"": C at first? -> Oh, C is at first. Avoid.\n\n So ""BLOCK"": B(1), L(2), O(3), C(4), K(5). C is at position 4. This seems acceptable.\n\n But note: we are allowed to try letters that have been marked absent? Actually, we know R,A,N,E are absent so we must avoid them. For letters that are present (like C) we must include them? Not necessarily: we are allowed to guess words without C? But since we know C is in the word, it would be inefficient to ignore that information. We should include C to try to locate it.\n\n Therefore, we must include C and avoid R,A,N,E.\n\n So words: ""BLOCK"", ""STOCK"" (but O is a vowel), ""STICK"" (I vowel), etc.\n\n I think ""BLOCK"" is a reasonable choice? But let me check the commonality.\n\n Alternatively, ""MUCKY"" - not very common.\n\n Let me choose ""BLOCK"": B, L, O, C, K.\n\n We test:\n   - B at position 1: if it is in the word and if correct or not.\n   - L at 2\n   - O at 3\n   - C at 4: we know C is in the word so we expect it to be marked either (-) or (✓). If it\'s not position 4, then we get (-) meaning it\'s elsewhere (and we know it\'s not position 1 from previous feedback, so then in positions 2,3,5? But we have positions: 1 is B so then 2,3,5). But we are testing L at 2, O at 3, and K at 5. So if we get feedback on C at 4, it may be correct or move.\n\n However, note: we have only 5 tries left? Actually, we used one, so 5 left? But we are at the second guess.\n\n But to be safe, let\'s try a word that has more new letters and also includes C.\n\n Another common word: ""CHAMP"" but C at first? avoid.\n\n ""PACKS"": P-A-C-K-S -> but A is absent? We know A is absent from the first feedback? Wait, no: in the first feedback, A was marked with x, so absent. So we must avoid A. So ""PACKS"" is invalid because it has A.\n\n ""PICKS"": P-I-C-K-S -> C is at position 3. That might be better because we don\'t know about position 3? So that\'s a good test.\n\n But ""PICKS"" has P, I, C, K, S. All new? And avoids A, R, N, E.\n\n Or ""LOCUS"": L-O-C-U-S -> but C is at position 3? Then U and S. But U is a vowel? And S is common.\n\n However, we know C is in the word, so we include it.\n\n Given the above, I think ""PICKS"" or ""BLOCK"" are both acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, since we haven\'t tested S and T, which are very common, let\'s try to include S.\n\n How about ""MUSIC"": M-U-S-I-C -> C at position 5? We get to test M, U, S, I, and C at the end.\n\n But U is less common? Or S and M are common.\n\n Another word: ""COSHY"" - not common.\n\n I think ""MUSIC"" might be a good candidate: it has common letters M, S, and vowels U, I.\n\n Let me decide: \n\n Option 1: ""BLOCK"" -> B, L, O, C, K\n Option 2: ""PICKS"" -> P, I, C, K, S\n Option 3: ""MUSIC"" -> M, U, S, I, C\n\n Which one tests more common letters? \n\n Common consonants: S, T, L, etc. So ""PICKS"" has P, C, K, S. ""BLOCK"" has B, L, C, K. ""MUSIC"" has M, S, C.\n\n Among vowels: O in ""BLOCK"", I in ""PICKS"", U and I in ""MUSIC"".\n\n We might prefer a word without repeating common letters? Actually, all distinct.\n\n I think ""PICKS"" is a good choice because it has S at the end and K which is common.\n\n But note: we have not tested T? Maybe we should leave T for now? We can test it next time.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s choose a word that includes T? But we can test T later.\n\n Since we are at the second guess and we have to include C, I\'ll go with ""PICKS"".\n\n Another word: ""CHINK"" -> but C at first? avoid.\n\n No: ""CHINK"" starts with C, which we must not do because we know C is not in position 1.\n\n Therefore, I\'ll choose ""PICKS"".\n\n Let me see: P-I-C-K-S\n\n If the word has C in position 3, we get a ✓ for C? Or if it\'s elsewhere, we get a -.\n\n Similarly, we see if P, I, K, S are present.\n\n Now, write the guess.\n\n But note: we are allowed any valid English word. ""PICKS"" is a valid word (it is the plural of pick).\n\n So I\'ll go with ""PICKS"".\n\n<guess>picks</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- C is present but not in position 1 (marked `-`)  \n- R, A, N, E are absent (marked `x`)  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n- Include C (since it exists in the word), but avoid positions 1 and the absent letters R, A, N, E.  \n- Prioritize new common letters like S, T, L, O, I to maximize information.  \n- Choose a word with C in a position not yet tested (positions 2–5).  \n\nSelected ""picks"" because:  \n- C is in position 3 (avoiding position 1).  \n- Introduces new common consonants (P, K, S) and vowel (I).  \n- Avoids R, A, N, E.  \n- Tests potential placements for C while probing additional common letters.\n\n<guess>picks</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: picks -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(-) C(-) K(-) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n1. crane: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x) -> C is in the word but not in position 1; R,A,N,E absent.\n2. picks: P(x) I(-) C(-) K(-) S(x) -> I, C, K are in the word but in wrong positions; P and S are absent.\n\nFrom guess 1, we know:\n- C is present and not in position 1.\n- R, A, N, E are absent.\n\nFrom guess 2:\n- I is present but not in position 2? Wait, in ""picks"":\n  - Position 1: P -> x (absent)\n  - Position 2: I -> - (in word, wrong position)\n  - Position 3: C -> - (in word, wrong position) -> note: earlier we knew C wasn\'t in position 1, but now it\'s not in position 3 either? Actually, the feedback tells us C is present but not in position 3 (or 1, from before).\n  - Position 4: K -> - (in word, wrong position)\n  - Position 5: S -> x (absent)\n\nSo combining:\n- Letters in the word: C, I, K (and we already knew C). Also note that I and K are new information.\n- Absent letters: R, A, N, E, P, S.\n\nKnown positions:\n- C cannot be in pos 1 (from first guess) or pos 3 (from second guess).\n- I cannot be in pos 2.\n- K cannot be in pos 4.\n\nThe secret word has 5 letters. We know it contains C, I, K, and one more letter we haven\'t guessed? Since we have three confirmed letters (C, I, K), there must be two more letters we haven\'t identified yet.\n\nLet me list:\n- Confirmed present: C, I, K (three letters)\n- So the word has two more letters? But we have five positions. So we need exactly two more letters that haven\'t been guessed.\n\nAnd we know the absent letters: R, A, N, E, P, S. So the remaining letters must be from the alphabet excluding these.\n\nAvailable letters: \nAlphabet minus R, A, N, E, P, S -> available: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we have two more letters to find, and we know three: C, I, K.\n\nSo the word must consist of C, I, K, and two new letters (distinct? possibly, but not necessarily).\n\nNow, constraints on positions:\n- Positions available for C: not 1 or 3 -> can be 2,4,5? Because it has to be in one of the other positions.\n\nSimilarly for I: not 2 -> can be 1,3,4,5? But note, position 1 is available? Yes.\n\nAnd for K: not 4 -> can be 1,2,3,5.\n\nBut also, the two new letters will occupy the remaining positions.\n\nHow to form a word?\n\nWe need to choose a word that:\n- Contains C, I, K (all three)\n- And two letters from the available letters (B,D,F,G,H,J,L,M,O,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z)\n- And also avoids placing C in positions 1 or 3, I in position 2, and K in position 4.\n\nMoreover, C must be in either 2,4, or 5? Actually, from the feedbacks:\nFrom ""crane"", C not in 1 -> possible positions: 2,3,4,5? But wait, in ""picks"", C was in position 3 and marked as wrong position -> so C is not in 3. Therefore C cannot be in position 1 or 3 -> so positions 2,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be in position 2? Actually, in ""picks"", I was in position 2 and marked wrong -> so I is not in position 2. But can be in 1,3,4,5? And K cannot be in 4 -> so K can be in 1,2,3,5.\n\nSo let me think about possible placements.\n\nWe must form a real word.\n\nWe also note that in the word, the positions for C,I,K must be such that they don\'t conflict.\n\nFor our next guess, we should include C, I, K and two new letters. We need to choose new letters that are common so we maximize information or guess the word.\n\nLet me try to think of words with these letters.\n\nConsider the letters: C, I, K and two more.\n\nPossibly, since we want common letters? Let\'s look for words that contain C, I, K.\n\nFor example, ""THICK"": \n- T and H are new? And letters: T,H,I,C,K.\n- Check positions: \n  - If we guess ""THICK"":\n    - T at 1: T is new -> could be?\n    - H at 2: H is new.\n    - I at position 3: but in our constraints, I cannot be in position 2? But it can be in 3? Yes, no constraint against position 3 for I? Only position 2 is forbidden for I? Correct.\n    - C at 4: which is allowed? Because C can be in 4? But we have constraint for C: not 1 or 3, so 4 is ok? But also want to test if this position is right.\n    - K at 5: which is allowed? Because K can be in 5? And constraint: K not in 4, so 5 is ok? Yes.\n\nBut let\'s see if the letters are acceptable: T and H are not absent? They haven\'t been tested before? So yes.\n\nAnother word: ""CLICK"" -> but L is new? Also C at position 1? Wait, ""CLICK"": C at position 1 -> but we know C cannot be position 1? Feedback from first guess said C(-) meaning it is in the word but not position 1? So we cannot choose a word that starts with C. Therefore, ""CLICK"" is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""KICK"" is only 4 letters? So no.\n\nAnother common word: ""BRICK"" -> B and R? But R is absent? From first guess: R(x) so absent. So cannot use R. Therefore invalid.\n\nHow about ""THICK""? As above.\n\nOr ""MAGIC"" -> but has A which is absent? A is absent? So no.\n\nAnother: ""MUSIC"" -> but has S? And we know S is absent? From second guess: S(x) so not present. So ""MUSIC"" contains S, which is absent? So not allowed? Because we must use only present letters? No: we must not use absent letters? Actually, in the rules, we have to guess words that use English words, but we should avoid letters that are absent? Because they are not in the word? Yes, by previous feedback.\n\nSo in our guess, we should avoid letters known to be absent: R,A,N,E,P,S.\n\nTherefore, ""THICK"": letter T and H are not absent? And the word has T,H,I,C,K.\n\nCheck:\n- T: not yet tested? Ok.\n- H: not tested? Ok.\n- I,C,K: are present? Yes.\n\nAnd positions: \n- Position 1: T? Could be, since we don\'t know what\'s in position 1.\n- Position 2: H? Could be.\n- Position 3: I -> this position is allowed? I can be in position 3? Yes.\n- Position 4: C -> allowed? Because C can be in 4? Yes, not forbidden.\n- Position 5: K -> allowed? Because K can be in 5? Yes.\n\nSo ""THICK"" might work? But let\'s see if there are constraints we missed? \n\nAlso, we need to verify that this matches existing feedback? Our guess should be consistent with previous feedback? No, we are making a new guess that may or may not be consistent? Actually, we don\'t require consistency? We are trying to solve.\n\nBut to be efficient, we can consider if there are better words? For example, a word that might cover more new letters.\n\nBut ""THICK"" introduces two new letters: T and H. T is very common? Yes.\n\nAnother possibility: ""QUICK"" -> but Q is hard? And U is a vowel? Also, U is new? So letters Q,U,I,C,K. But we avoid absent letters? And Q,U not absent? But Q might be less effective? Because if we use Q and it\'s not present, we lose information? But we have only four guesses left? We should prioritize common letters.\n\nI think ""THICK"" is reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, with different letters: ""CHICK"" -> C at first? Wait, ""CHICK"": C is first? That would be invalid? So no.\n\nOr ""DICK"" - but 4 letters? No.\n\nAnother word: ""WICK"" - also 4 letters? \n\nOr ""COVET"" but then missing I and K? We must include all three: C, I, K.\n\nBecause they are known to be in the word? Actually, we are required to include only English words, but if we don\'t include I and K, it would not be efficient? Because we know they are present? Yes, so we should include them to get positional information.\n\nTherefore, we must include C, I, K? Because we have limited tries? And they are confirmed.\n\nSo back to words containing C, I, K? And two other letters from available.\n\nAnother word: ""VICKY"" - but we have Y? Also, it has double letters? Specifically, Y is acceptable? But ""VICKY"" is not a common word? It might be a name? But we need English words? So assume standard Wordle dictionary.\n\nI think ""THICK"" is more standard.\n\nAlternatively, ""CLINK"" -> but L and N? But N is absent? So no.\n\n""BLINK"" -> no, same issue? N absent? And also, we don\'t have I and K? Wait, ""BLINK"" has I and K? And C? No, no C? It has B,L,I,N,K? But N is absent? So invalid.\n\nPerhaps ""FLICK"" -> but F,L,I,C,K? Position: F(1), L(2), I(3), C(4), K(5) -> avoids absent letters: no R,A,N,E,P,S? So F and L are new.\n\nBut C at 4? We allow? Yes. I at 3? Allowed? Yes. K at 5? Allowed? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""FLICK"" is a valid word? Meaning to flick something.\n\nOr ""CLICK"" is not possible? Because C first? No.\n\nBut we remember: ""THICK"" and ""FLICK"" are both possibilities.\n\nOr ""TRICK"" -> T,R,I,C,K? But R is absent? So invalid.\n\nSo ""THICK"" or ""FLICK""?\n\nWhat about ""CHINK""? But H and N? N absent? No.\n\nNow, let me check commonality? Or maybe we can use a word that includes a vowel? Both have vowels? T, H are consonants? Or in ""THICK"", H is a consonant? But we haven\'t tested vowels? Actually, the only vowel in our word so far is I? And we know the absent vowels: A,E? So vowels O,U,Y might be present? Or not?\n\nWe need vowels: the secret word must have vowels? Since it is English? So possible vowels: O,U,Y? Or I is the only vowel? But we know I is present? So it might have another vowel?\n\nSo in our guess, we might prefer a word that tests a vowel? If we haven\'t tested any other vowels? For instance, we haven\'t tested O,U,Y.\n\nIn ""THICK"", there is only I? So it might not reveal any new vowel? Similarly ""FLICK""? Both have only I as vowel? Which is good? Because it has the vowel I we know.\n\nBut we also need to cover more letters? Maybe not necessary? \n\nAnother word: ""OUNCE"" but E absent? No? So cannot.\n\nOr ""COUCH"" but C at first? And no I or K? So not.\n\nI think ""THICK"" is fine? Or choose ""FLICK""?\n\nLet me check the possibility: We need words that have C,I,K and two from available? Now, we must avoid absent letters: R,A,N,E,P,S.\n\nSo for our list: let me suggest ""THICK"" or ""FLICK"".\n\nBut note: if we guess ""THICK"", then:\n- If the word is not ""THICK"", we might get feedback that helps.\n\nSimilarly, ""FLICK""?\n\nI think both are valid? But let me see which covers more common letters? T and H vs F and L? T is more common? So ""THICK"" might be better? Because T is very common.\n\nSimilarly, we can also consider the positions: in ""THICK"", we have:\n- C at position 4? If the secret word has C at position 4? Then we get correct? But if not, at least we test.\n\nNow, let me think about other words? \n\nAnother candidate: ""DOCH"" -> too short? \n\nOr ""QUICK"" with Q and U? Which are less common? But Q is rare? So might be inefficient.\n\n""WHISK"" -> but has H,I,S,K? But S is absent? So invalid.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll choose ""THICK"".\n\nSo <guess>thick</guess>\n\nBut note: the word ""THICK"" spells T-H-I-C-K? Letters: T, H, I, C, K? Yes.\n\nAnd we include C,I,K? And T,H which are new and not absent? Also, positions: \n1: T (could be present or not? We\'ll see)\n2: H (same)\n3: I? We know I is present, but not position 2? Now we test position 3? And C at position 4? Which is possible? And K at 5? Which is possible.\n\nSo it\'s a valid guess.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""THICK"".\n\nBut let\'s double-check against constraints:\n- Avoid absent letters: R,A,N,E,P,S -> ""THICK"" has T,H,I,C,K -> no problem? T and H are allowed? Because not yet known as absent? Yes.\n- Positions: I at 3: which is allowed? (since I cannot be at position 2? But position 3 is ok) -> yes.\n- C at position 4: allowed? (since C cannot be at 1 or 3? Position 4 is allowed? Yes) -> yes.\n- K at position 5: allowed? (K cannot be at 4? Position 5 is allowed? Yes) -> yes.\n\nSo all good.\n\nThus, the guess is ""THICK"".After analyzing the feedback from the first two guesses:\n\n1. **crane**: C is present (wrong position), confirming C is in the word but not position 1. R, A, N, E are absent.\n2. **picks**: I, C, K are present but all in wrong positions (I not position 2, C not position 3, K not position 4). P and S are absent.\n\nKey deductions:\n- **Confirmed letters in the word**: C, I, K (all must appear in the next guess).\n- **Absent letters**: R, A, N, E, P, S (must avoid these in the new guess).\n- **Position constraints**:\n  - C cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (must be in 2, 4, or 5).\n  - I cannot be in position 2 (must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5).\n  - K cannot be in position 4 (must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5).\n- The word must include two additional letters from the remaining available alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).\n\nFor the next guess, a word must incorporate C, I, K and introduce two new letters to maximize information. The word **thick** was selected because:\n- It includes C (position 4, allowed), I (position 3, allowed), and K (position 5, allowed).\n- It introduces T and H, common consonants not yet tested.\n- It avoids all absent letters (R, A, N, E, P, S).\n- As a valid English word, it tests new letters while respecting position constraints.\n\n<guess>thick</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: picks -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(-) C(-) K(-) S(x)\nGuess 3: thick -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) I(✓) C(✓) K(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from previous guesses:
1. Guess 1: crane -> C(-): C is in the word but not in position 1; R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x): these letters are absent.
2. Guess 2: picks -> P(x): absent; I(-): I is in the word but not in position 2; C(-): C is in the word but not in position 3; K(-): K is in the word but not in position 4; S(x): absent.
3. Guess 3: thick -> T(x): absent; H(x): absent; I(✓): I is in position 3; ✓ C(✓): C is in position 4; ✓ K(✓): K is in position 5. ✓

Important deductions from guess 3 (thick):
- I is in position 3, C in position 4, K in position 5. So the word ends with I, C, K? Specifically, positions 3,4,5 are I, C, K respectively? Wait: thick was guessed as T-H-I-C-K → 
  Position 1: T (x: absent) 
  Position 2: H (x: absent) 
  Position 3: I (✓: correct) 
  Position 4: C (✓: correct) 
  Position 5: K (✓: correct) 

So the secret word has: 
- Position 3: I 
- Position:4: C 
- Position:5: K 

Therefore, the word is in the form: __ I C K

And we know the first two letters are not T or H? Because T and H are absent? Yes.

Also looking back at previous constraints:
- From guess 1: C is present but not position 1? Now we have it in position 4? So that matches? But position 1 was previously unknown? Except for letters absent.
- From guess 2: we learned that I is not position 2? But in guess 3, we have I in position 3? Correct? Similarly, C not position 3? But here it is position 4? Correct? K not position 4? But here it is position 5? Correct? And all are now placed correctly.

Also, absent letters so far: R, A, N, E, P, S, T, H.

So absent: R, A, N, E, P, S, T, H.

Now, the secret word is of the form: _ _ I C K

We need to guess the first two letters? They must be letters that are not absent? So the remaining letters? Also, they must form an English word.

Moreover, we must include the constraints? Because the first guess told us C not position 1? Which is satisfied? And no other constraints? Except the absent letters.

The second letter: in guess 2, I was in position 2 and marked wrong? But that doesn't directly constrain the second letter because I is not in position 2? And we know that now? Actually, we know I is in position 3? So position 2 is something else.

Now, for the word: _ _ I C K

We need to choose two letters for positions 1 and 2 that are not in the absent list? Absent letters: R, A, N, E, P, S, T, H.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But only common ones? And must form a word.

Possible words: 
- B L I C K? ""BLICK"" is not a standard English word? According to many dictionaries, it might not be recognized? But Wordle uses some common words? Alternatively, ""BLOCK""? But O is not absent? And we haven't used O? But ""BLOCK"" has O? And letters B,L,O,C,K? But we need the word to end with I,C,K? So no? Because we have position 3 must be I? So ""BLOCK"" ends with O,C,K? Not matching.

So the word must have positions: 1: ?, 2: ?, then I,C,K.

So it must be a word that ends with 'ICK'? And the first two letters are to be guessed.

Common words ending with ICK: 
- CLICK? But starts with C? Position 1: C? But from first guess, C was in position 1 and marked wrong? So C cannot be in position 1? Therefore ""CLICK"" is invalid? Because it forces position 1=C? Which we know is absent? Actually, not absent? We know C is in position 4? But if we put C in position 1? Then it should be marked differently? But we know C cannot be in position 1? So we avoid. Moreover, in ""CLICK"", C in position 1? Which we know cannot be? Because in ""crane"", C was position 1 and marked (-)? Meaning it is present but not at that position? So if we put C anywhere else? But in this case? We have the word? But we know C must be in position 4? So it cannot be in position 1? So ""CLICK"" would be impossible? Because it requires C in position 1? Which we know is wrong.

Similarly, other words:
- PICK? But 4 letters? No, 5 letters.
- TRICK? But T is absent.
- BRICK? R is absent? And B: B is not absent? But R is? So invalid.
- FRICK? Or FRISK? FRISK has S? Absent? And not ending with IC?K? It ends with SK? Not ICK.
- Words: ""THICK"" we guessed? And it had T and H which are absent? So not.
- ""QUICK"": Q,U,I,C,K? Positions: Q(1), U(2), I(3), C(4), K(5). This matches the pattern? 
  - Position 1: Q? Is Q absent? We haven't tested Q? So we don't know? 
  - Position 2: U?
  - Then I,C,K.
  - So ""QUICK"" is a valid word? And letters: Q,U? Both not in the absent list? So possible? 

But let me check the constraints:
- From first guess: C was placed position 1? But in QUICK we are putting Q at position 1? Not C? So that's fine.
- Also, we know C is at position 4? So placing C at 4? Which is correct? And K at 5? Correct? Etc.
- ""QUICK"" has U? Which is a vowel? And we haven't tested it? So it's a candidate.

Other words: 
- ""CLICK"" as above? Invalid? Because if we put CLICK we would put C at 1? But position must have C at 4? In conflict? Actually no? Because in QUICK we don't have C at 1? So let me see: alternative words ending with ICK? Like ""MICK""? But 4 letters? 
- 5 letter words: ""CHICK"" -> C-H-I-C-K? But position 1: C? Which we know cannot be? Since C must be at position 4? And if we put C at 1? That would be incorrect? Because the secret word has position 4:C? So in ""CHICK"", position 4 is C? And position 1 is C? That might be? But we don't know? But from the first guess, C was at position 1? And marked as present? But wrong position? If C were at position 4? Then the marking was correct? But we are allowed? However, the problem is that the secret word might have more than one C? But in our feedback? It didn't show? But the rules support multiple letters? Unless specified.

Actually, look back at feedback? In ""thick"", we have C at position 4? Correct? So if the word had two C's? For example? Then the feedback might have shown differently? But in ""thick"", only position 4:C is marked correct? Which matches? In the first guess ""crane"", we placed C at position 1? And got (-): meaning the letter C is present but not at this position? So if the word has only one C? At position 4? Then it is correct? But if it had two C's? Say position 1 and 4? Then in guess 1? Position 1:C? Would not be marked absent? It would be marked (-) if C is present elsewhere? Actually? Yes: the marking is per letter? So if there are two C's? Then we might get more than one (-) for multiple occurrences? But in our case? In ""crane"", we had one C? Marked as (-)? Which is consistent with one C at another? Or multiple? But we don't know? Similarly, in ""thick""? We have C at position 4? Marked correct? And no other C? So what about ""CHICK""?""CHICK"" has C at position 1 and position 4? But in guess 3? We guessed ""thick""? Which has only one C? At position 4? Which was marked correct? So if the secret word were ""CHICK"", then:
In guess 3: ""thick"" → we have positions: 1:T? (but we put T? Which is absent? But in CHICK: position1:C? Position4:C? Position5:K? Position3:I? So if we guessed ""thick""? Then letter T? The secret word has no T? So yes? T marked absent? H marked absent? I,C at 3,4 marked correct? K at 5 correct? So that seems consistent? But we got absent for T and H? Which is fine? However? In secret word ""CHICK"": first letter C? But in guess 1? We guessed ""crane"" with C at position 1? And feedback: C(-)? Which would mean if position1 has C? Then it would be marked correct? But it was (-)? Meaning correct letter wrong spot? If C is at position1? Then it should be marked (✓)? Or when letter is correct and in place? Marked (✓)? 

Rule? ✓: in the correct position? -: in the word? Wrong position? x: not in the word.

In ""crane"" guess? If position1 was C? Then it should have been (✓)? But it was (-)? Meaning the C is not at position1? But present? Therefore in CHICK? We have C at position1? But this would have made the first feedback C(✓)? Or if CHICK were the secret? Then for first guess ""crane"": first letter C? And secret first letter C? Then it should be ✓? But we got C(-)? Therefore? The secret word does NOT have C at position1? So ""CHICK"" is impossible? Because it has C as first letter? Thus ruled out.

Similarly? Two C's? But first letter C? Then the first guess would be C(✓)? But we got C(-)? Therefore? Position1 cannot be C? And any word starting with C is impossible? So QUICK? Starts with Q? Not C? So possible.

Back to our possibilities? Words ending with ICK? And letter at positions 1 and 2 not absent and not C? So:
- QUICK: Q and U? 
- Or ""MICK"": not 5 letters? 
- ""FLICK"": but F and L? But L? Could work?
In ""thick"" we guessed T? Which is absent? So a word like FLICK? Position:F?L?I?C?K? But it ends with ICK? So same? But F and L are not absent? Since we haven't tested them? So F and L available? So ""FLICK""? 

Also? ""BLICK"" might not be a word? But ""CLICK"" is a word? But starts with C? No? Not allowed? As above? Position1=C? Contradicts first feedback? So if the word ends with ICK? Also? ""PRICK"" but P is absent? ""TRICK"": T absent? Etc.

So ""QUICK"" and ""FLICK"" are candidates? And also? ""WICK"" is short? 

Or ""DICK"": 4? Also? ""BICK"": 4? 

Perhaps ""OUNCE"" not? Etc.

Now? Another possibility? ""JUICY"" but it ends with CY? Not ICK? So not.

Therefore? The candidates are ""QUICK"", ""FLICK"", and perhaps others? Like ""CLICK"" but invalid? So with the above? So possibly ""QUICK"" and ""FLICK""? Also? ""BRICK"" but R absent? Etc.

But also? ""WHACK""? But not ending with ICK? 

So focusing on __ICK words:
- FLICK: F and L? 
- QUICK: Q and U? 
- Also? ""SLICK"" but S is absent? So no? 
- ""BLICK"" may not be standard? 
- ""TRICK"": absent letters? T? So no? 
- ""CRICK"": C first? Invalid? 
- ""KICK"": not 5? 

Therefore? Mainly two possibilities: FLICK and QUICK? 

Now? Between them? Which to choose? And we want to cover letters? We need to know if there are other factors? Such as? We also have not tested some letters? 

In guess 3? THICK? We got T?x and H?x? So absent? But we know positions 1 and 2 are not T or H? So FLICK? Would introduce F and L? And QUICK? Q and U? U is a vowel? So might be useful? But Q is rare? So perhaps FLICK? Might be better? But we don't know? 

But note? We have tried 3 guesses? And we have 3 tries left? So we can try one? Then guess.

Perhaps we can also consider? Are there other words? Ending with ICK? 

For example? ""ABACK"" but A absent? ""AFRIC"": but not ending with ICK? And C? Not? Etc.

Or ""EDICT"": E?absent? So no? 

So? FLICK or QUICK? 

But also? ""VICKS""? But S?absent? And ""VICKED""? Not a word? 

Therefore? I think the only common ones are FLICK? and QUICK? 

Now? Since we want to maximize information? If we guess QUICK? we test Q and U? Which are less common? And if it's wrong? Then we know? But FLICK? F and L? L is more common? 

Alternatively? We might consider? What if we don't want to guess possible words? But try other letters? 

But since we have only two possibilities? We should pick one? And if wrong? Then the other? 

Therefore? Let's choose ""FLICK""? Because F and L are more likely? But the word? English? 

Or? Another idea: we could guess a word that has the known positions? And tests two new letters? Which might not be a candidate word? But since the secret word is one of QUICK or FLICK? We don't know? So better to guess one of them? 

Thus? I'll go with ""FLICK"".

Guess: FLICK? Letters: F,L,I,C,K? Positions: F at1, L at2, I at3, C at4, K at5? But position 3,4,5 are I,C,K? Which are correct? So if we guess FLICK? And the secret is FLICK? Then it wins? If not? Then it must be QUICK? Then we'll guess QUICK next? 

But also? Are there more words? For example? ""BRICK"" but R absent? ""PRICK"" P?absent? So no? 

Therefore? Only FLICK and QUICK? With FLICK using F at1?L at2? And QUICK?Q at1?U at2? 

Now? But to decide? Maybe flip a coin? 

But note? In FLICK? we test F and L? Which we haven't tried? Similarly QUICK? Q and U? 

Commonness? F and L are more common than Q? 

But since we don't know? we randomly pick? 

I'll pick ""FLICK"" first? Because it appears simpler.

So <guess>flick</guess> 

But wait? If the secret word is QUICK? Then our guess FLICK? 
Feedback would be? F,L,I,C,K? 
Position1:F? If secret is QUICK? Then F is absent? Position2:L?absent? Position3:I?present and correct? Etc? But that would not lose? Because we have tries? And then we guess QUICK? 

So acceptable? 

Alternatively? Guess QUICK? equally likely? 

But I'll choose FLICK? So guess ""FLICK"".After analyzing the feedback:

- **Confirmed letters**: 
  - Position 3: I
  - Position 4: C
  - Position 5: K
- **Absent letters**: R, A, N, E, P, S, T, H
- **Word structure**: [letter1] [letter2] I C K, where letter1 and letter2:
    - Must not be from absent letters
    - Cannot be C (due to position constraints from prior feedback)
    - Candidates: FLICK (F, L) or QUICK (Q, U)

Given that FLICK uses common letters and adheres to the structure, it is prioritized. If incorrect, QUICK can be guessed next.

<guess>flick</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- The secret word has the format: **? ? I C K**, meaning positions 3, 4, and 5 are confirmed as I, C, K.
- Letters confirmed absent: R, A, N, E, P, S, T, H (cannot be used).

For the next guess:
- The word must fill positions 1 and 2 with letters not in the absent list, forming a valid 5-letter English word ending in ""ICK"".
- Possible candidates include **FLICK** (F and L) or **QUICK** (Q and U), as both avoid absent letters and fit the pattern.
- **FLICK** was chosen to test the viable combination using common letters (F and L). If incorrect, QUICK can be guessed next.

<guess>flick</guess>",flick,"We have feedback from previous guesses:
1. Guess 1: crane -> C(-): C is in the word but not in position 1; R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x): these letters are absent.
2. Guess 2: picks -> P(x): absent; I(-): I is in the word but not in position 2; C(-): C is in the word but not in position 3; K(-): K is in the word but not in position 4; S(x): absent.
3. Guess 3: thick -> T(x): absent; H(x): absent; I(✓): I is in position 3; ✓ C(✓): C is in position 4; ✓ K(✓): K is in position 5. ✓

Important deductions from guess 3 (thick):
- I is in position 3, C in position 4, K in position 5. So the word ends with I, C, K? Specifically, positions 3,4,5 are I, C, K respectively? Wait: thick was guessed as T-H-I-C-K → 
  Position 1: T (x: absent) 
  Position 2: H (x: absent) 
  Position 3: I (✓: correct) 
  Position 4: C (✓: correct) 
  Position 5: K (✓: correct) 

So the secret word has: 
- Position 3: I 
- Position:4: C 
- Position:5: K 

Therefore, the word is in the form: __ I C K

And we know the first two letters are not T or H? Because T and H are absent? Yes.

Also looking back at previous constraints:
- From guess 1: C is present but not position 1? Now we have it in position 4? So that matches? But position 1 was previously unknown? Except for letters absent.
- From guess 2: we learned that I is not position 2? But in guess 3, we have I in position 3? Correct? Similarly, C not position 3? But here it is position 4? Correct? K not position 4? But here it is position 5? Correct? And all are now placed correctly.

Also, absent letters so far: R, A, N, E, P, S, T, H.

So absent: R, A, N, E, P, S, T, H.

Now, the secret word is of the form: _ _ I C K

We need to guess the first two letters? They must be letters that are not absent? So the remaining letters? Also, they must form an English word.

Moreover, we must include the constraints? Because the first guess told us C not position 1? Which is satisfied? And no other constraints? Except the absent letters.

The second letter: in guess 2, I was in position 2 and marked wrong? But that doesn't directly constrain the second letter because I is not in position 2? And we know that now? Actually, we know I is in position 3? So position 2 is something else.

Now, for the word: _ _ I C K

We need to choose two letters for positions 1 and 2 that are not in the absent list? Absent letters: R, A, N, E, P, S, T, H.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But only common ones? And must form a word.

Possible words: 
- B L I C K? ""BLICK"" is not a standard English word? According to many dictionaries, it might not be recognized? But Wordle uses some common words? Alternatively, ""BLOCK""? But O is not absent? And we haven't used O? But ""BLOCK"" has O? And letters B,L,O,C,K? But we need the word to end with I,C,K? So no? Because we have position 3 must be I? So ""BLOCK"" ends with O,C,K? Not matching.

So the word must have positions: 1: ?, 2: ?, then I,C,K.

So it must be a word that ends with 'ICK'? And the first two letters are to be guessed.

Common words ending with ICK: 
- CLICK? But starts with C? Position 1: C? But from first guess, C was in position 1 and marked wrong? So C cannot be in position 1? Therefore ""CLICK"" is invalid? Because it forces position 1=C? Which we know is absent? Actually, not absent? We know C is in position 4? But if we put C in position 1? Then it should be marked differently? But we know C cannot be in position 1? So we avoid. Moreover, in ""CLICK"", C in position 1? Which we know cannot be? Because in ""crane"", C was position 1 and marked (-)? Meaning it is present but not at that position? So if we put C anywhere else? But in this case? We have the word? But we know C must be in position 4? So it cannot be in position 1? So ""CLICK"" would be impossible? Because it requires C in position 1? Which we know is wrong.

Similarly, other words:
- PICK? But 4 letters? No, 5 letters.
- TRICK? But T is absent.
- BRICK? R is absent? And B: B is not absent? But R is? So invalid.
- FRICK? Or FRISK? FRISK has S? Absent? And not ending with IC?K? It ends with SK? Not ICK.
- Words: ""THICK"" we guessed? And it had T and H which are absent? So not.
- ""QUICK"": Q,U,I,C,K? Positions: Q(1), U(2), I(3), C(4), K(5). This matches the pattern? 
  - Position 1: Q? Is Q absent? We haven't tested Q? So we don't know? 
  - Position 2: U?
  - Then I,C,K.
  - So ""QUICK"" is a valid word? And letters: Q,U? Both not in the absent list? So possible? 

But let me check the constraints:
- From first guess: C was placed position 1? But in QUICK we are putting Q at position 1? Not C? So that's fine.
- Also, we know C is at position 4? So placing C at 4? Which is correct? And K at 5? Correct? Etc.
- ""QUICK"" has U? Which is a vowel? And we haven't tested it? So it's a candidate.

Other words: 
- ""CLICK"" as above? Invalid? Because if we put CLICK we would put C at 1? But position must have C at 4? In conflict? Actually no? Because in QUICK we don't have C at 1? So let me see: alternative words ending with ICK? Like ""MICK""? But 4 letters? 
- 5 letter words: ""CHICK"" -> C-H-I-C-K? But position 1: C? Which we know cannot be? Since C must be at position 4? And if we put C at 1? That would be incorrect? Because the secret word has position 4:C? So in ""CHICK"", position 4 is C? And position 1 is C? That might be? But we don't know? But from the first guess, C was at position 1? And marked as present? But wrong position? If C were at position 4? Then the marking was correct? But we are allowed? However, the problem is that the secret word might have more than one C? But in our feedback? It didn't show? But the rules support multiple letters? Unless specified.

It would be marked (-) if C is present elsewhere? Actually? Yes: the marking is per letter? So if there are two C's? Then we might get more than one (-) for multiple occurrences? But in our case? In ""crane"", we had one C? Marked as (-)? Which is consistent with one C at another? Or multiple? But we don't know? Similarly, in ""thick""? We have C at position 4? Marked correct? And no other C? So what about ""CHICK""?""CHICK"" has C at position 1 and position 4? But in guess 3? We guessed ""thick""? Which has only one C? At position 4? Which was marked correct? So if the secret word were ""CHICK"", then:
