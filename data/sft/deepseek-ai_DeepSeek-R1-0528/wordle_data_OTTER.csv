We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to gather information.
 Some common starting words in word games are: CRANE, RAISE, SLATE, etc.

 Considering that, I choose ""RAISE"" as my first guess because:
  - It contains two vowels (A, I) and three consonants (R, S, E - where E is also very common)
  - It has common letters that appear in many words.

 Let me guess: ""RAISE""

We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
  R: - (meaning R is in the secret word but not in the first position)
  A: x (A is not in the secret word)
  I: x (I is not in the secret word)
  S: x (S is not in the secret word)
  E: - (E is in the secret word but not in the last position)

 So, we know:
  - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions we guessed (R was first, E was last).
  - The secret word does not contain A, I, or S.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to form a new guess.

 Important: We must avoid using A, I, and S in the new guess because they are not in the word.

 We know the word has R and E, and we have 5 letters to fill.

 Let's think about possible positions for R and E:
  - R is not in position 1 (since we had R in position 1 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning it's elsewhere).
  - E is not in position 5 (since we had E in position 5 and it was marked as wrong position).

 We also know that the word does not have A, I, S.

 We need to choose a word that:
  - Does not contain A, I, S.
  - Contains R and E (and three other letters that are not A, I, S).
  - Places R not in position 1 and E not in position 5.

 We can also consider common letters to get more information.

 Since we have two known letters (R and E), we can try to use them in different positions.

 Let's try to think of a word that has R and E, and also includes other common letters (like T, N, O, L, etc.) to test.

 Possible positions for R: 2, 3, 4, 5 (but note: if we put R in position 5, that's allowed because we only know it's not in 1).
 Similarly, E can be in positions 1,2,3,4 (but not 5).

 However, we must avoid using A, I, S.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and E and three new letters.

 Example words:
  - ""TRIED"": has T, R, I, E, D -> but I is not allowed (we know I is not in the word). So invalid.
  - ""ROBED"": has R, O, B, E, D -> but O and B are new. Also, R is in position 1? We must avoid R in position 1. So if we put R in position 1, that's not allowed. We need to move R to another position.

 We can try ""BORED"":
  - B, O, R, E, D
  - R is in position 3 (which is not 1) -> okay.
  - E is in position 4 (which is not 5) -> okay.
  - Also, no A, I, S.

 But note: we don't know if O, B, D are in the word. This is a good candidate because it tests new letters.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRWTH"" but that's not common and has no vowels? We need a valid English word.

 Another idea: ""ENTER"" -> but E is in position 1 and 4? But we have two E's? We don't know if the word has two E's. Also, R is at the end (position 5). But we have E in position 1 and 4? Let's see:
  - E in position 1: we don't know if that's allowed (since E can be in 1-4). But we also have E in position 4 and 5? Actually, ""ENTER"" has E at 1, N, T, E at 4, R at 5. 
  - However, we have E at position 1 and 4. But the feedback for the first guess only told us that E is in the word (but not at position 5). It didn't say anything about having two E's. So it's possible.

 But note: we must avoid using A, I, S. ""ENTER"" doesn't have those. However, we have R at position 5. That's allowed because we only know R is not at 1.

 But let me check: the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not at position 1. So it could be at 5.

 However, we also have to consider that we are limited to 5-letter words. ""ENTER"" is valid.

 But we want to maximize information. ""BORED"" and ""ENTER"" are both options.

 Another common word: ""LONER"" -> L, O, N, E, R. 
  - R is at position 5 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). 
  - No A, I, S.

 But note: we have two known letters (R and E) and we are using them. We also test L, O, N.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R and E in positions we haven't tried. In the first guess, R was in position 1 and E in position 5. Now we can try R in positions 2,3,4 and E in 1,2,3,4.

 Let me think of a word that has R in position 2 and E in position 4? For example: ""CRANE"" -> but C, R, A, N, E -> A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So invalid.

 How about ""TREND"": 
  - T, R, E, N, D -> R is in position 2 (not 1) and E in position 3 (not 5). 
  - No A, I, S.

 But note: we have E in position 3. That's allowed.

 However, we already know E is in the word, so we are testing T, R (again but in a new position), E (in a new position), N, D.

 But we are also testing if R is in position 2? We know R is in the word, but we don't know where. So testing R in position 2 is good.

 Similarly, we are testing E in position 3.

 I think ""TREND"" is a good candidate.

 But wait, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn't show any duplicate, but we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROUTE"": 
  - R, O, U, T, E -> R in position 1? That's not allowed because we know R is not in position 1. So we cannot use R in position 1.

 Therefore, we must avoid R in position 1.

 Let me list some words that have R and E, without A, I, S, and without R in position 1:

  - Position 2: R in second position -> e.g., ""TREND"", ""CREST"" (but C,R,E,S,T -> S is not allowed) -> invalid.
  - Position 3: R in third -> ""BORED"", ""CORED"", ""GORED"", ""LURED"", etc. But we must avoid S and A and I.

 ""BORED"": B, O, R, E, D -> R in 3, E in 4 -> good.

 ""LURED"": L, U, R, E, D -> R in 3, E in 4 -> good.

 ""CORED"": C, O, R, E, D -> same.

 But we don't know if the word has O, U, etc.

 Another: ""PERKY"" -> P, E, R, K, Y -> E in 2, R in 3 -> but we have E in position 2? That's allowed. And R in 3. Also, no A, I, S.

 However, we are also testing P, K, Y.

 We want to cover common letters. Common consonants: T, N, L, etc. Vowels: O, U, E (we already have E) and we know A is out.

 Since we have E, we can try to use other vowels: O, U.

 I think ""TREND"" is a good choice because it uses common letters (T, R, E, N, D) and we can get information about T, N, D.

 But note: in ""TREND"", we have:
   T in position 1 -> we don't know if T is in the word.
   R in position 2 -> we know R is in the word, but if it's in position 2 we get feedback.
   E in position 3 -> we know E is in the word, but if it's in position 3 we get feedback.
   N in position 4 -> test N.
   D in position 5 -> test D.

 Also, we avoid A, I, S.

 So I will go with ""TREND"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has two R's? We don't know. But we are using R only once. Similarly for E.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put R and E in the same positions as the first guess? We had R at 1 and E at 5, so now we are putting R at 2 and E at 3? That's different.

 Let me confirm: the first guess had R at 1 and E at 5. Now we are trying R at 2 and E at 3.

 So, I think ""TREND"" is a good second guess.

 However, note that the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 3, that's a new position.

 Let's go with ""TREND"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5.
- A, I, and S are not in the secret word.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Avoid using A, I, or S.
2. Include R and E (since they are confirmed in the word).
3. Place R in a position other than 1 (e.g., positions 2–5).
4. Place E in a position other than 5 (e.g., positions 1–4).
5. Test new common letters (like T, N, D) to gather more information.

A strong candidate is **""TREND""**:
- T (new letter), R (in position 2), E (in position 3), N (new letter), D (new letter).
- It avoids A/I/S and repositions R and E based on feedback.
- This tests high-frequency consonants (T, N, D) while leveraging known letters.

  - E is not in position 5 (since we had E in position 5 and it was marked as wrong position).

 We also know that the word does not have A, I, S.

 We need to choose a word that:
  - Does not contain A, I, S.
  - Contains R and E (and three other letters that are not A, I, S).
  - Places R not in position 1 and E not in position 5.

 We can also consider common letters to get more information.

 Since we have two known letters (R and E), we can try to use them in different positions.

 Let's try to think of a word that has R and E, and also includes other common letters (like T, N, O, L, etc.) to test.

 Possible positions for R: 2, 3, 4, 5 (but note: if we put R in position 5, that's allowed because we only know it's not in 1).
 Similarly, E can be in positions 1,2,3,4 (but not 5).

 However, we must avoid using A, I, S.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and E and three new letters.

 Example words:
  - ""TRIED"": has T, R, I, E, D -> but I is not allowed (we know I is not in the word). So invalid.
  - ""ROBED"": has R, O, B, E, D -> but O and B are new. Also, R is in position 1? We must avoid R in position 1. So if we put R in position 1, that's not allowed. We need to move R to another position.

 We can try ""BORED"":
  - B, O, R, E, D
  - R is in position 3 (which is not 1) -> okay.
  - E is in position 4 (which is not 5) -> okay.
  - Also, no A, I, S.

 But note: we don't know if O, B, D are in the word. This is a good candidate because it tests new letters.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRWTH"" but that's not common and has no vowels? We need a valid English word.

 Another idea: ""ENTER"" -> but E is in position 1 and 4? But we have two E's? We don't know if the word has two E's. Also, R is at the end (position 5). But we have E in position 1 and 4? Let's see:
  - E in position 1: we don't know if that's allowed (since E can be in 1-4). But we also have E in position 4 and 5? Actually, ""ENTER"" has E at 1, N, T, E at 4, R at 5. 
  - However, we have E at position 1 and 4. But the feedback for the first guess only told us that E is in the word (but not at position 5). It didn't say anything about having two E's. So it's possible.

 But note: we must avoid using A, I, S. ""ENTER"" doesn't have those. However, we have R at position 5. That's allowed because we only know R is not at 1.

 But let me check: the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not at position 1. So it could be at 5.

 However, we also have to consider that we are limited to 5-letter words. ""ENTER"" is valid.

 But we want to maximize information. ""BORED"" and ""ENTER"" are both options.

 Another common word: ""LONER"" -> L, O, N, E, R. 
  - R is at position 5 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). 
  - No A, I, S.

 But note: we have two known letters (R and E) and we are using them. We also test L, O, N.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R and E in positions we haven't tried. In the first guess, R was in position 1 and E in position 5. Now we can try R in positions 2,3,4 and E in 1,2,3,4.

 Let me think of a word that has R in position 2 and E in position 4? For example: ""CRANE"" -> but C, R, A, N, E -> A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So invalid.

 How about ""TREND"": 
  - T, R, E, N, D -> R is in position 2 (not 1) and E in position 3 (not 5). 
  - No A, I, S.

 But note: we have E in position 3. That's allowed.

 However, we already know E is in the word, so we are testing T, R (again but in a new position), E (in a new position), N, D.

 But we are also testing if R is in position 2? We know R is in the word, but we don't know where. So testing R in position 2 is good.

 Similarly, we are testing E in position 3.

 I think ""TREND"" is a good candidate.

 But wait, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn't show any duplicate, but we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROUTE"": 
  - R, O, U, T, E -> R in position 1? That's not allowed because we know R is not in position 1. So we cannot use R in position 1.

 Therefore, we must avoid R in position 1.

 Let me list some words that have R and E, without A, I, S, and without R in position 1:

  - Position 2: R in second position -> e.g., ""TREND"", ""CREST"" (but C,R,E,S,T -> S is not allowed) -> invalid.
  - Position 3: R in third -> ""BORED"", ""CORED"", ""GORED"", ""LURED"", etc. But we must avoid S and A and I.

 ""BORED"": B, O, R, E, D -> R in 3, E in 4 -> good.

 ""LURED"": L, U, R, E, D -> R in 3, E in 4 -> good.

 ""CORED"": C, O, R, E, D -> same.

 But we don't know if the word has O, U, etc.

 Another: ""PERKY"" -> P, E, R, K, Y -> E in 2, R in 3 -> but we have E in position 2? That's allowed. And R in 3. Also, no A, I, S.

 However, we are also testing P, K, Y.

 We want to cover common letters. Common consonants: T, N, L, etc. Vowels: O, U, E (we already have E) and we know A is out.

 Since we have E, we can try to use other vowels: O, U.

 I think ""TREND"" is a good choice because it uses common letters (T, R, E, N, D) and we can get information about T, N, D.

 But note: in ""TREND"", we have:
   T in position 1 -> we don't know if T is in the word.
   R in position 2 -> we know R is in the word, but if it's in position 2 we get feedback.
   E in position 3 -> we know E is in the word, but if it's in position 3 we get feedback.
   N in position 4 -> test N.
   D in position 5 -> test D.

 Also, we avoid A, I, S.

 So I will go with ""TREND"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has two R's? We don't know. But we are using R only once. Similarly for E.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put R and E in the same positions as the first guess? We had R at 1 and E at 5, so now we are putting R at 2 and E at 3? That's different.

 Let me confirm: the first guess had R at 1 and E at 5. Now we are trying R at 2 and E at 3.

 So, I think ""TREND"" is a good second guess.

 However, note that the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 3, that's a new position.

 Let's go with ""TREND"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5.
- A, I, and S are not in the secret word.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Avoid using A, I, or S.
2. Include R and E (since they are confirmed in the word).
3. Place R in a position other than 1 (e.g., positions 2–5).
4. Place E in a position other than 5 (e.g., positions 1–4).
5. Test new common letters (like T, N, D) to gather more information.

A strong candidate is **""TREND""**:
- T (new letter), R (in position 2), E (in position 3), N (new letter), D (new letter).
- It avoids A/I/S and repositions R and E based on feedback.
- This tests high-frequency consonants (T, N, D) while leveraging known letters.

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A, I, S are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: TREND -> T(-) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)
Meaning:
- T is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 3.
- N and D are not in the word.

Now, combining the information:

Letters NOT in the word: A, I, S, N, D.
Letters IN the word: R, E, T.

Additionally, we know positions where letters cannot be:
- R is not in position 1 (from Guess 1) and not in position 2 (from Guess 2).
- E is not in position 5 (from Guess 1) and not in position 3 (from Guess 2).
- T is not in position 1 (from Guess 2).

The secret word is 5 letters and must contain R, E, T, and two additional letters that we haven't tested or that are confirmed (but we don't know yet).

We have tested the letters: R, A, I, S, E, T, R, E, N, D (from both guesses). So the known absent letters are: A, I, S, N, D.

Therefore, the word must contain R, E, T, and two other letters that are not A, I, S, N, D.

We also have positional constraints:
- R cannot be in position 1 or 2.
- E cannot be in position 3 or 5.
- T cannot be in position 1.

Possible positions for R: 3, 4, or 5.
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, or 4. (since not 3 or 5)
Possible positions for T: 2, 3, 4, 5. (not 1)

Now, we need to form a word that includes R, E, T and two new letters (not A,I,S,N,D), and satisfies the positional constraints.

We need to choose two new letters. Let's consider common consonants and vowels. Since we have no vowels besides E (and E is the only vowel we know for sure), we might need another vowel? But the word might have other vowels such as O, U, Y, etc.

We also want to maximize information, so we should try to use common letters and cover positions we haven't tested.

Let's list the positions:

We have:
- Position 1: Cannot be R (known) or T (from feedback). Also, cannot be A,I,S,N,D. And not E? We don't know; E can be at position 1. So possible: any letter not excluded, including E? But let's see.

We know E can be at position 1. So position 1 can be E or other letters not excluded.

Excluded letters: A, I, S, N, D.

Common letters left: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also have to include R, E, T.

Now, think of words that have R, E, T and two letters from the above, with constraints on positions.

We have feedback that R is not in pos1 or 2, E not in 3 or 5, T not in 1.

So let's try to find a word that meets this.

Example: 
- E could be in position 1: then T must be in 2,3,4,5 but not 1. But if E is at 1, then we have E _ _ _ _
- R must be in 3,4,5.
- T must be in 2,3,4,5.

Possibly ""ETHER"", but we don't know about H and the second E? But we haven't eliminated H. However, ""ETHER"" has two E's? Let's check: 
- E in pos1, T in pos2? But T in pos2: is that allowed? We know T is in the word, but we don't know about pos2. However, we have to test. But also, R is in pos5? R can be at pos5.

But note: we also have to avoid N and D? ""ETHER"" has E, T, H, E, R. So letters: E, T, H, R. H is not excluded.

But wait, does it have two E's? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. The feedback hasn't indicated duplicates yet, but it's possible.

However, in the first guess, E was tested and marked as ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not at pos5. In the second guess, E was at pos3 and marked ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not at pos3. So the E could be the same E? Or a different E? It could be the same E, meaning it must be in a position that is not 3 or 5. So positions 1,2,4.

If there is only one E, then in ""ETHER"", it has E at pos1 and pos4? Then the word has two E's. That's possible.

But we need to verify.

Alternatively, consider other words.

Another option: ""METRO"":
- M, E, T, R, O -> E at pos2, T at pos3, R at pos4.
Check positions:
  - R at pos4: allowed (since not 1 or 2)
  - E at pos2: allowed (since not 3 or 5)
  - T at pos3: allowed (since not 1)

Also, M and O are new letters not excluded.

This seems good.

Similarly, ""METRO"" uses common letters.

Another example: ""TERM "" is 4 letters, no. We need 5 letters.

""OUTER"": 
- O, U, T, E, R -> but E at 4, R at 5? 
But E cannot be at 5? Feedback from guess1 E is not at 5. So if E is at 4? That's allowed? Yes, E can be at 4. Then R at 5: allowed? R can be at 5. T at pos3: allowed? Yes, T can be anywhere except 1.

But we have O and U. U is a vowel? We don't know if U is in the word.

But let me check: position of E? If E is at 4: good. 
Also, we avoid excluded letters.

We could also try ""METRO"" as suggested.

But note: in ""METRO"", we have:
- Position 1: M (not excluded)
- Position 2: E (which we know is in the word and can be at 2? Yes, because not pos3 or 5)
- Position 3: T (allowed? T can be at 3, since not 1)
- Position 4: R (allowed? R not at1 or2, so yes)
- Position 5: O

And we test M and O.

Also, we use all three known letters.

But note: we are testing E at position 2 and T at position 3. If the word has E at position 2, then we might get a check mark? Similarly for T at 3.

But we don't know.

Another word: ""JUMBO"" - no T,R,E.

Must include R,E,T.

Let's list candidates:
- ""METRO"": M, E, T, R, O
- ""RETRO"": but R at pos1? Not allowed. R cannot be at1.
- ""LATER"": but A is excluded -> invalid.
- ""TIGER"": T,I,G,E,R -> I excluded -> invalid.
- ""PETER"": P, E, T, E, R -> has E twice. 
  - Position: E at2 and4? Then we have E at2: allowed? Yes. T at3: allowed. R at5: allowed. But we are using double E? That's possible. However, we have P which is new.

But we don't know if P is allowed.

Same with ""METRO"".

Now, what about ""QUERY"": Q,U,E,R,Y -> but E is at pos3? But E cannot be at pos3 because from guess2 we know E is not at pos3. So invalid.

Similarly, ""QUEUE"" - doesn't have R or T.

Another: ""MERIT"": has I -> invalid.

How about ""BERET"": B, E, R, E, T -> has E twice? And check positions:
- Position1: B? not excluded.
- Position2: E? allowed? Yes, since not 3 or 5.
- Position3: R? but R cannot be at pos3? Wait, no: R can be at pos3? We know R is not at 1 or 2, but pos3 is allowed? Yes, because feedback only said not pos1 and not pos2, so pos3 is possible.
- Position4: E? and position5: T? T can be at5? yes.

But R at pos3? We thought R can be in 3,4,5. So ""BERET"" has R at3: allowed? Yes.

But we have E at2 and E at4? And T at5? 

Also, B is new.

But note: we haven't used any excluded letters.

Alternatively, we can try ""TOWER"": T at1? Not allowed! T cannot be at1. So ""TOWER"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""TROVE"": T at1? invalid.

So, ""METRO"" seems like a strong candidate because:
- It tests E at2 and T at3, which are new positions we haven't tested.
- It tests two new common letters: M and O.
- It satisfies all position constraints.

Moreover, it doesn't conflict with known constraints.

So I'll go with ""METRO"".

But let me double-check: 
- Guess1: RAISE: R was in pos1 (wrong pos), now we are putting R in pos4? We haven't tested pos4 for R. Same for E: we tested E in pos5 and pos3, now in pos2.

And T in pos3? We know T is in the word but not in pos1 (from TREND where T was in pos1). Now we are testing T in pos3.

Yes, this should give us more information.

Therefore, the next guess is ""METRO"".
</think>
Based on previous feedback:

- **RAISE**: R (wrong position), E (wrong position), A/I/S not in the word.
- **TREND**: T (wrong position), R (wrong position), E (wrong position), N/D not in the word.

### Deductions:
1. **Letters in the secret word**: R, E, T must be present (since all received ""-"" feedback).
2. **Letters NOT in the word**: A, I, S (from RAISE), N, D (from TREND).
3. **Position constraints**:
   - R cannot be in position 1 or 2.
   - E cannot be in position 3 or 5.
   - T cannot be in position 1.
4. The secret word has two unknown letters (from the alphabet excluding A/I/S/N/D), and we need to test new common letters like M, O, L, etc.
5. Possible positions:
   - R: Positions 3, 4, or 5.
   - E: Positions 1, 2, or 4.
   - T: Positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Choose a word that includes R, E, T and two new letters to maximize information, avoiding excluded letters.
- Place R, E, T in positions that haven’t been tested yet and satisfy the constraints (e.g., R not in 1/2, E not in 3/5, T not in 1).
- **""METRO""** is a strong candidate:
  - M (position 1): New consonant.
  - E (position 2): Tests a new position for E (allowed since E ≠ position 3/5).
  - T (position 3): Tests a new position for T (allowed since T ≠ position 1).
  - R (position 4): Tests a new position for R (allowed since R ≠ positions 1/2).
  - O (position 5): New vowel to test.
  - Avoids A/I/S/N/D.

This guess efficiently tests the known letters in new positions while probing two new letters (M and O).

<guess>METRO</guess>",METRO,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A, I, S are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: TREND -> T(-) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)
Meaning:
- T is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 3.
- N and D are not in the word.

Now, combining the information:

Letters NOT in the word: A, I, S, N, D.
Letters IN the word: R, E, T.

Additionally, we know positions where letters cannot be:
- R is not in position 1 (from Guess 1) and not in position 2 (from Guess 2).
- E is not in position 5 (from Guess 1) and not in position 3 (from Guess 2).
- T is not in position 1 (from Guess 2).

The secret word is 5 letters and must contain R, E, T, and two additional letters that we haven't tested or that are confirmed (but we don't know yet).

We have tested the letters: R, A, I, S, E, T, R, E, N, D (from both guesses). So the known absent letters are: A, I, S, N, D.

Therefore, the word must contain R, E, T, and two other letters that are not A, I, S, N, D.

We also have positional constraints:
- R cannot be in position 1 or 2.
- E cannot be in position 3 or 5.
- T cannot be in position 1.

Possible positions for R: 3, 4, or 5.
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, or 4. (since not 3 or 5)
Possible positions for T: 2, 3, 4, 5. (not 1)

Now, we need to form a word that includes R, E, T and two new letters (not A,I,S,N,D), and satisfies the positional constraints.

We need to choose two new letters. Let's consider common consonants and vowels. Since we have no vowels besides E (and E is the only vowel we know for sure), we might need another vowel? But the word might have other vowels such as O, U, Y, etc.

We also want to maximize information, so we should try to use common letters and cover positions we haven't tested.

Let's list the positions:

We have:
- Position 1: Cannot be R (known) or T (from feedback). Also, cannot be A,I,S,N,D. And not E? We don't know; E can be at position 1. So possible: any letter not excluded, including E? But let's see.

We know E can be at position 1. So position 1 can be E or other letters not excluded.

Excluded letters: A, I, S, N, D.

Common letters left: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also have to include R, E, T.

Now, think of words that have R, E, T and two letters from the above, with constraints on positions.

We have feedback that R is not in pos1 or 2, E not in 3 or 5, T not in 1.

So let's try to find a word that meets this.

Example: 
- E could be in position 1: then T must be in 2,3,4,5 but not 1. But if E is at 1, then we have E _ _ _ _
- R must be in 3,4,5.
- T must be in 2,3,4,5.

Possibly ""ETHER"", but we don't know about H and the second E? But we haven't eliminated H. However, ""ETHER"" has two E's? Let's check: 
- E in pos1, T in pos2? But T in pos2: is that allowed? We know T is in the word, but we don't know about pos2. However, we have to test. But also, R is in pos5? R can be at pos5.

But note: we also have to avoid N and D? ""ETHER"" has E, T, H, E, R. So letters: E, T, H, R. H is not excluded.

But wait, does it have two E's? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. The feedback hasn't indicated duplicates yet, but it's possible.

However, in the first guess, E was tested and marked as ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not at pos5. In the second guess, E was at pos3 and marked ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not at pos3. So the E could be the same E? Or a different E? It could be the same E, meaning it must be in a position that is not 3 or 5. So positions 1,2,4.

If there is only one E, then in ""ETHER"", it has E at pos1 and pos4? Then the word has two E's. That's possible.

But we need to verify.

Alternatively, consider other words.

Another option: ""METRO"":
- M, E, T, R, O -> E at pos2, T at pos3, R at pos4.
Check positions:
  - R at pos4: allowed (since not 1 or 2)
  - E at pos2: allowed (since not 3 or 5)
  - T at pos3: allowed (since not 1)

Also, M and O are new letters not excluded.

This seems good.

Similarly, ""METRO"" uses common letters.

Another example: ""TERM "" is 4 letters, no. We need 5 letters.

""OUTER"": 
- O, U, T, E, R -> but E at 4, R at 5? 
But E cannot be at 5? Feedback from guess1 E is not at 5. So if E is at 4? That's allowed? Yes, E can be at 4. Then R at 5: allowed? R can be at 5. T at pos3: allowed? Yes, T can be anywhere except 1.

But we have O and U. U is a vowel? We don't know if U is in the word.

But let me check: position of E? If E is at 4: good. 
Also, we avoid excluded letters.

We could also try ""METRO"" as suggested.

But note: in ""METRO"", we have:
- Position 1: M (not excluded)
- Position 2: E (which we know is in the word and can be at 2? Yes, because not pos3 or 5)
- Position 3: T (allowed? T can be at 3, since not 1)
- Position 4: R (allowed? R not at1 or2, so yes)
- Position 5: O

And we test M and O.

Also, we use all three known letters.

But note: we are testing E at position 2 and T at position 3. If the word has E at position 2, then we might get a check mark? Similarly for T at 3.

But we don't know.

Another word: ""JUMBO"" - no T,R,E.

Must include R,E,T.

Let's list candidates:
- ""METRO"": M, E, T, R, O
- ""RETRO"": but R at pos1? Not allowed. R cannot be at1.
- ""LATER"": but A is excluded -> invalid.
- ""TIGER"": T,I,G,E,R -> I excluded -> invalid.
- ""PETER"": P, E, T, E, R -> has E twice. 
  - Position: E at2 and4? Then we have E at2: allowed? Yes. T at3: allowed. R at5: allowed. But we are using double E? That's possible. However, we have P which is new.

But we don't know if P is allowed.

Same with ""METRO"".

Now, what about ""QUERY"": Q,U,E,R,Y -> but E is at pos3? But E cannot be at pos3 because from guess2 we know E is not at pos3. So invalid.

Similarly, ""QUEUE"" - doesn't have R or T.

Another: ""MERIT"": has I -> invalid.

How about ""BERET"": B, E, R, E, T -> has E twice? And check positions:
- Position1: B? not excluded.
- Position2: E? allowed? Yes, since not 3 or 5.
- Position3: R? but R cannot be at pos3? Wait, no: R can be at pos3? We know R is not at 1 or 2, but pos3 is allowed? Yes, because feedback only said not pos1 and not pos2, so pos3 is possible.
- Position4: E? and position5: T? T can be at5? yes.

But R at pos3? We thought R can be in 3,4,5. So ""BERET"" has R at3: allowed? Yes.

But we have E at2 and E at4? And T at5? 

Also, B is new.

But note: we haven't used any excluded letters.

Alternatively, we can try ""TOWER"": T at1? Not allowed! T cannot be at1. So ""TOWER"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""TROVE"": T at1? invalid.

So, ""METRO"" seems like a strong candidate because:
- It tests E at2 and T at3, which are new positions we haven't tested.
- It tests two new common letters: M and O.
- It satisfies all position constraints.

Moreover, it doesn't conflict with known constraints.

So I'll go with ""METRO"".

But let me double-check: 
- Guess1: RAISE: R was in pos1 (wrong pos), now we are putting R in pos4? We haven't tested pos4 for R. Same for E: we tested E in pos5 and pos3, now in pos2.

And T in pos3? We know T is in the word but not in pos1 (from TREND where T was in pos1). Now we are testing T in pos3.

Yes, this should give us more information.

Therefore, the next guess is ""METRO"".Based on previous feedback:

- **RAISE**: R (wrong position), E (wrong position), A/I/S not in the word.
- **TREND**: T (wrong position), R (wrong position), E (wrong position), N/D not in the word.

### Deductions:
1. **Letters in the secret word**: R, E, T must be present (since all received ""-"" feedback).
2. **Letters NOT in the word**: A, I, S (from RAISE), N, D (from TREND).
3. **Position constraints**:
   - R cannot be in position 1 or 2.
   - E cannot be in position 3 or 5.
   - T cannot be in position 1.
4. The secret word has two unknown letters (from the alphabet excluding A/I/S/N/D), and we need to test new common letters like M, O, L, etc.
5. Possible positions:
   - R: Positions 3, 4, or 5.
   - E: Positions 1, 2, or 4.
   - T: Positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Choose a word that includes R, E, T and two new letters to maximize information, avoiding excluded letters.
- Place R, E, T in positions that haven’t been tested yet and satisfy the constraints (e.g., R not in 1/2, E not in 3/5, T not in 1).
- **""METRO""** is a strong candidate:
  - M (position 1): New consonant.
  - E (position 2): Tests a new position for E (allowed since E ≠ position 3/5).
  - T (position 3): Tests a new position for T (allowed since T ≠ position 1).
  - R (position 4): Tests a new position for R (allowed since R ≠ positions 1/2).
  - O (position 5): New vowel to test.
  - Avoids A/I/S/N/D.

This guess efficiently tests the known letters in new positions while probing two new letters (M and O).",Guess 3: METRO -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) T(✓) R(-) O(-),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to gather information.
 Some common starting words in word games are: CRANE, RAISE, SLATE, etc.

 Considering that, I choose ""RAISE"" as my first guess because:
  - It contains two vowels (A, I) and three consonants (R, S, E - where E is also very common)
  - It has common letters that appear in many words.

 Let me guess: ""RAISE""

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
  R: - (meaning R is in the secret word but not in the first position)
  A: x (A is not in the secret word)
  I: x (I is not in the secret word)
  S: x (S is not in the secret word)
  E: - (E is in the secret word but not in the last position)

 So, we know:
  - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions we guessed (R was first, E was last).
  - The secret word does not contain A, I, or S.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to form a new guess.

 Important: We must avoid using A, I, and S in the new guess because they are not in the word.

 We know the word has R and E, and we have 5 letters to fill.

 Let's think about possible positions for R and E:
  - R is not in position 1 (since we had R in position 1 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning it's elsewhere).
  - E is not in position 5 (since we had E in position 5 and it was marked as wrong position).

 We also know that the word does not have A, I, S.

 We need to choose a word that:
  - Does not contain A, I, S.
  - Contains R and E (and three other letters that are not A, I, S).
  - Places R not in position 1 and E not in position 5.

 We can also consider common letters to get more information.

 Since we have two known letters (R and E), we can try to use them in different positions.

 Let's try to think of a word that has R and E, and also includes other common letters (like T, N, O, L, etc.) to test.

 Possible positions for R: 2, 3, 4, 5 (but note: if we put R in position 5, that's allowed because we only know it's not in 1).
 Similarly, E can be in positions 1,2,3,4 (but not 5).

 However, we must avoid using A, I, S.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and E and three new letters.

 Example words:
  - ""TRIED"": has T, R, I, E, D -> but I is not allowed (we know I is not in the word). So invalid.
  - ""ROBED"": has R, O, B, E, D -> but O and B are new. Also, R is in position 1? We must avoid R in position 1. So if we put R in position 1, that's not allowed. We need to move R to another position.

 We can try ""BORED"":
  - B, O, R, E, D
  - R is in position 3 (which is not 1) -> okay.
  - E is in position 4 (which is not 5) -> okay.
  - Also, no A, I, S.

 But note: we don't know if O, B, D are in the word. This is a good candidate because it tests new letters.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRWTH"" but that's not common and has no vowels? We need a valid English word.

 Another idea: ""ENTER"" -> but E is in position 1 and 4? But we have two E's? We don't know if the word has two E's. Also, R is at the end (position 5). But we have E in position 1 and 4? Let's see:
  - E in position 1: we don't know if that's allowed (since E can be in 1-4). But we also have E in position 4 and 5? Actually, ""ENTER"" has E at 1, N, T, E at 4, R at 5. 
  - However, we have E at position 1 and 4. But the feedback for the first guess only told us that E is in the word (but not at position 5). It didn't say anything about having two E's. So it's possible.

 But note: we must avoid using A, I, S. ""ENTER"" doesn't have those. However, we have R at position 5. That's allowed because we only know R is not at 1.

 But let me check: the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not at position 1. So it could be at 5.

 However, we also have to consider that we are limited to 5-letter words. ""ENTER"" is valid.

 But we want to maximize information. ""BORED"" and ""ENTER"" are both options.

 Another common word: ""LONER"" -> L, O, N, E, R. 
  - R is at position 5 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). 
  - No A, I, S.

 But note: we have two known letters (R and E) and we are using them. We also test L, O, N.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R and E in positions we haven't tried. In the first guess, R was in position 1 and E in position 5. Now we can try R in positions 2,3,4 and E in 1,2,3,4.

 Let me think of a word that has R in position 2 and E in position 4? For example: ""CRANE"" -> but C, R, A, N, E -> A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So invalid.

 How about ""TREND"": 
  - T, R, E, N, D -> R is in position 2 (not 1) and E in position 3 (not 5). 
  - No A, I, S.

 But note: we have E in position 3. That's allowed.

 However, we already know E is in the word, so we are testing T, R (again but in a new position), E (in a new position), N, D.

 But we are also testing if R is in position 2? We know R is in the word, but we don't know where. So testing R in position 2 is good.

 Similarly, we are testing E in position 3.

 I think ""TREND"" is a good candidate.

 But wait, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn't show any duplicate, but we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROUTE"": 
  - R, O, U, T, E -> R in position 1? That's not allowed because we know R is not in position 1. So we cannot use R in position 1.

 Therefore, we must avoid R in position 1.

 Let me list some words that have R and E, without A, I, S, and without R in position 1:

  - Position 2: R in second position -> e.g., ""TREND"", ""CREST"" (but C,R,E,S,T -> S is not allowed) -> invalid.
  - Position 3: R in third -> ""BORED"", ""CORED"", ""GORED"", ""LURED"", etc. But we must avoid S and A and I.

 ""BORED"": B, O, R, E, D -> R in 3, E in 4 -> good.

 ""LURED"": L, U, R, E, D -> R in 3, E in 4 -> good.

 ""CORED"": C, O, R, E, D -> same.

 But we don't know if the word has O, U, etc.

 Another: ""PERKY"" -> P, E, R, K, Y -> E in 2, R in 3 -> but we have E in position 2? That's allowed. And R in 3. Also, no A, I, S.

 However, we are also testing P, K, Y.

 We want to cover common letters. Common consonants: T, N, L, etc. Vowels: O, U, E (we already have E) and we know A is out.

 Since we have E, we can try to use other vowels: O, U.

 I think ""TREND"" is a good choice because it uses common letters (T, R, E, N, D) and we can get information about T, N, D.

 But note: in ""TREND"", we have:
   T in position 1 -> we don't know if T is in the word.
   R in position 2 -> we know R is in the word, but if it's in position 2 we get feedback.
   E in position 3 -> we know E is in the word, but if it's in position 3 we get feedback.
   N in position 4 -> test N.
   D in position 5 -> test D.

 Also, we avoid A, I, S.

 So I will go with ""TREND"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has two R's? We don't know. But we are using R only once. Similarly for E.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put R and E in the same positions as the first guess? We had R at 1 and E at 5, so now we are putting R at 2 and E at 3? That's different.

 Let me confirm: the first guess had R at 1 and E at 5. Now we are trying R at 2 and E at 3.

 So, I think ""TREND"" is a good second guess.

 However, note that the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 3, that's a new position.

 Let's go with ""TREND"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5.
- A, I, and S are not in the secret word.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Avoid using A, I, or S.
2. Include R and E (since they are confirmed in the word).
3. Place R in a position other than 1 (e.g., positions 2–5).
4. Place E in a position other than 5 (e.g., positions 1–4).
5. Test new common letters (like T, N, D) to gather more information.

A strong candidate is **""TREND""**:
- T (new letter), R (in position 2), E (in position 3), N (new letter), D (new letter).
- It avoids A/I/S and repositions R and E based on feedback.
- This tests high-frequency consonants (T, N, D) while leveraging known letters.

<guess>TREND</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TREND -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A, I, S are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: TREND -> T(-) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)
Meaning:
- T is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 3.
- N and D are not in the word.

Now, combining the information:

Letters NOT in the word: A, I, S, N, D.
Letters IN the word: R, E, T.

Additionally, we know positions where letters cannot be:
- R is not in position 1 (from Guess 1) and not in position 2 (from Guess 2).
- E is not in position 5 (from Guess 1) and not in position 3 (from Guess 2).
- T is not in position 1 (from Guess 2).

The secret word is 5 letters and must contain R, E, T, and two additional letters that we haven't tested or that are confirmed (but we don't know yet).

We have tested the letters: R, A, I, S, E, T, R, E, N, D (from both guesses). So the known absent letters are: A, I, S, N, D.

Therefore, the word must contain R, E, T, and two other letters that are not A, I, S, N, D.

We also have positional constraints:
- R cannot be in position 1 or 2.
- E cannot be in position 3 or 5.
- T cannot be in position 1.

Possible positions for R: 3, 4, or 5.
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, or 4. (since not 3 or 5)
Possible positions for T: 2, 3, 4, 5. (not 1)

Now, we need to form a word that includes R, E, T and two new letters (not A,I,S,N,D), and satisfies the positional constraints.

We need to choose two new letters. Let's consider common consonants and vowels. Since we have no vowels besides E (and E is the only vowel we know for sure), we might need another vowel? But the word might have other vowels such as O, U, Y, etc.

We also want to maximize information, so we should try to use common letters and cover positions we haven't tested.

Let's list the positions:

We have:
- Position 1: Cannot be R (known) or T (from feedback). Also, cannot be A,I,S,N,D. And not E? We don't know; E can be at position 1. So possible: any letter not excluded, including E? But let's see.

We know E can be at position 1. So position 1 can be E or other letters not excluded.

Excluded letters: A, I, S, N, D.

Common letters left: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also have to include R, E, T.

Now, think of words that have R, E, T and two letters from the above, with constraints on positions.

We have feedback that R is not in pos1 or 2, E not in 3 or 5, T not in 1.

So let's try to find a word that meets this.

Example: 
- E could be in position 1: then T must be in 2,3,4,5 but not 1. But if E is at 1, then we have E _ _ _ _
- R must be in 3,4,5.
- T must be in 2,3,4,5.

Possibly ""ETHER"", but we don't know about H and the second E? But we haven't eliminated H. However, ""ETHER"" has two E's? Let's check: 
- E in pos1, T in pos2? But T in pos2: is that allowed? We know T is in the word, but we don't know about pos2. However, we have to test. But also, R is in pos5? R can be at pos5.

But note: we also have to avoid N and D? ""ETHER"" has E, T, H, E, R. So letters: E, T, H, R. H is not excluded.

But wait, does it have two E's? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. The feedback hasn't indicated duplicates yet, but it's possible.

However, in the first guess, E was tested and marked as ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not at pos5. In the second guess, E was at pos3 and marked ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not at pos3. So the E could be the same E? Or a different E? It could be the same E, meaning it must be in a position that is not 3 or 5. So positions 1,2,4.

If there is only one E, then in ""ETHER"", it has E at pos1 and pos4? Then the word has two E's. That's possible.

But we need to verify.

Alternatively, consider other words.

Another option: ""METRO"":
- M, E, T, R, O -> E at pos2, T at pos3, R at pos4.
Check positions:
  - R at pos4: allowed (since not 1 or 2)
  - E at pos2: allowed (since not 3 or 5)
  - T at pos3: allowed (since not 1)

Also, M and O are new letters not excluded.

This seems good.

Similarly, ""METRO"" uses common letters.

Another example: ""TERM "" is 4 letters, no. We need 5 letters.

""OUTER"": 
- O, U, T, E, R -> but E at 4, R at 5? 
But E cannot be at 5? Feedback from guess1 E is not at 5. So if E is at 4? That's allowed? Yes, E can be at 4. Then R at 5: allowed? R can be at 5. T at pos3: allowed? Yes, T can be anywhere except 1.

But we have O and U. U is a vowel? We don't know if U is in the word.

But let me check: position of E? If E is at 4: good. 
Also, we avoid excluded letters.

We could also try ""METRO"" as suggested.

But note: in ""METRO"", we have:
- Position 1: M (not excluded)
- Position 2: E (which we know is in the word and can be at 2? Yes, because not pos3 or 5)
- Position 3: T (allowed? T can be at 3, since not 1)
- Position 4: R (allowed? R not at1 or2, so yes)
- Position 5: O

And we test M and O.

Also, we use all three known letters.

But note: we are testing E at position 2 and T at position 3. If the word has E at position 2, then we might get a check mark? Similarly for T at 3.

But we don't know.

Another word: ""JUMBO"" - no T,R,E.

Must include R,E,T.

Let's list candidates:
- ""METRO"": M, E, T, R, O
- ""RETRO"": but R at pos1? Not allowed. R cannot be at1.
- ""LATER"": but A is excluded -> invalid.
- ""TIGER"": T,I,G,E,R -> I excluded -> invalid.
- ""PETER"": P, E, T, E, R -> has E twice. 
  - Position: E at2 and4? Then we have E at2: allowed? Yes. T at3: allowed. R at5: allowed. But we are using double E? That's possible. However, we have P which is new.

But we don't know if P is allowed.

Same with ""METRO"".

Now, what about ""QUERY"": Q,U,E,R,Y -> but E is at pos3? But E cannot be at pos3 because from guess2 we know E is not at pos3. So invalid.

Similarly, ""QUEUE"" - doesn't have R or T.

Another: ""MERIT"": has I -> invalid.

How about ""BERET"": B, E, R, E, T -> has E twice? And check positions:
- Position1: B? not excluded.
- Position2: E? allowed? Yes, since not 3 or 5.
- Position3: R? but R cannot be at pos3? Wait, no: R can be at pos3? We know R is not at 1 or 2, but pos3 is allowed? Yes, because feedback only said not pos1 and not pos2, so pos3 is possible.
- Position4: E? and position5: T? T can be at5? yes.

But R at pos3? We thought R can be in 3,4,5. So ""BERET"" has R at3: allowed? Yes.

But we have E at2 and E at4? And T at5? 

Also, B is new.

But note: we haven't used any excluded letters.

Alternatively, we can try ""TOWER"": T at1? Not allowed! T cannot be at1. So ""TOWER"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""TROVE"": T at1? invalid.

So, ""METRO"" seems like a strong candidate because:
- It tests E at2 and T at3, which are new positions we haven't tested.
- It tests two new common letters: M and O.
- It satisfies all position constraints.

Moreover, it doesn't conflict with known constraints.

So I'll go with ""METRO"".

But let me double-check: 
- Guess1: RAISE: R was in pos1 (wrong pos), now we are putting R in pos4? We haven't tested pos4 for R. Same for E: we tested E in pos5 and pos3, now in pos2.

And T in pos3? We know T is in the word but not in pos1 (from TREND where T was in pos1). Now we are testing T in pos3.

Yes, this should give us more information.

Therefore, the next guess is ""METRO"".Based on previous feedback:

- **RAISE**: R (wrong position), E (wrong position), A/I/S not in the word.
- **TREND**: T (wrong position), R (wrong position), E (wrong position), N/D not in the word.

### Deductions:
1. **Letters in the secret word**: R, E, T must be present (since all received ""-"" feedback).
2. **Letters NOT in the word**: A, I, S (from RAISE), N, D (from TREND).
3. **Position constraints**:
   - R cannot be in position 1 or 2.
   - E cannot be in position 3 or 5.
   - T cannot be in position 1.
4. The secret word has two unknown letters (from the alphabet excluding A/I/S/N/D), and we need to test new common letters like M, O, L, etc.
5. Possible positions:
   - R: Positions 3, 4, or 5.
   - E: Positions 1, 2, or 4.
   - T: Positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Choose a word that includes R, E, T and two new letters to maximize information, avoiding excluded letters.
- Place R, E, T in positions that haven’t been tested yet and satisfy the constraints (e.g., R not in 1/2, E not in 3/5, T not in 1).
- **""METRO""** is a strong candidate:
  - M (position 1): New consonant.
  - E (position 2): Tests a new position for E (allowed since E ≠ position 3/5).
  - T (position 3): Tests a new position for T (allowed since T ≠ position 1).
  - R (position 4): Tests a new position for R (allowed since R ≠ positions 1/2).
  - O (position 5): New vowel to test.
  - Avoids A/I/S/N/D.

This guess efficiently tests the known letters in new positions while probing two new letters (M and O).

So invalid.\n  - ""ROBED"": has R, O, B, E, D -> but O and B are new. Also, R is in position 1? We must avoid R in position 1. So if we put R in position 1, that\'s not allowed. We need to move R to another position.\n\n We can try ""BORED"":\n  - B, O, R, E, D\n  - R is in position 3 (which is not 1) -> okay.\n  - E is in position 4 (which is not 5) -> okay.\n  - Also, no A, I, S.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if O, B, D are in the word. This is a good candidate because it tests new letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""CRWTH"" but that\'s not common and has no vowels? We need a valid English word.\n\n Another idea: ""ENTER"" -> but E is in position 1 and 4? But we have two E\'s? We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, R is at the end (position 5). But we have E in position 1 and 4? Let\'s see:\n  - E in position 1: we don\'t know if that\'s allowed (since E can be in 1-4). But we also have E in position 4 and 5? Actually, ""ENTER"" has E at 1, N, T, E at 4, R at 5. \n  - However, we have E at position 1 and 4. But the feedback for the first guess only told us that E is in the word (but not at position 5). It didn\'t say anything about having two E\'s. So it\'s possible.\n\n But note: we must avoid using A, I, S. ""ENTER"" doesn\'t have those. However, we have R at position 5. That\'s allowed because we only know R is not at 1.\n\n But let me check: the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not at position 1. So it could be at 5.\n\n However, we also have to consider that we are limited to 5-letter words. ""ENTER"" is valid.\n\n But we want to maximize information. ""BORED"" and ""ENTER"" are both options.\n\n Another common word: ""LONER"" -> L, O, N, E, R. \n  - R is at position 5 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). \n  - No A, I, S.\n\n But note: we have two known letters (R and E) and we are using them. We also test L, O, N.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put R and E in positions we haven\'t tried. In the first guess, R was in position 1 and E in position 5. Now we can try R in positions 2,3,4 and E in 1,2,3,4.\n\n Let me think of a word that has R in position 2 and E in position 4? For example: ""CRANE"" -> but C, R, A, N, E -> A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So invalid.\n\n How about ""TREND"": \n  - T, R, E, N, D -> R is in position 2 (not 1) and E in position 3 (not 5). \n  - No A, I, S.\n\n But note: we have E in position 3. That\'s allowed.\n\n However, we already know E is in the word, so we are testing T, R (again but in a new position), E (in a new position), N, D.\n\n But we are also testing if R is in position 2? We know R is in the word, but we don\'t know where. So testing R in position 2 is good.\n\n Similarly, we are testing E in position 3.\n\n I think ""TREND"" is a good candidate.\n\n But wait, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn\'t show any duplicate, but we don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ROUTE"": \n  - R, O, U, T, E -> R in position 1? That\'s not allowed because we know R is not in position 1. So we cannot use R in position 1.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid R in position 1.\n\n Let me list some words that have R and E, without A, I, S, and without R in position 1:\n\n  - Position 2: R in second position -> e.g., ""TREND"", ""CREST"" (but C,R,E,S,T -> S is not allowed) -> invalid.\n  - Position 3: R in third -> ""BORED"", ""CORED"", ""GORED"", ""LURED"", etc. But we must avoid S and A and I.\n\n ""BORED"": B, O, R, E, D -> R in 3, E in 4 -> good.\n\n ""LURED"": L, U, R, E, D -> R in 3, E in 4 -> good.\n\n ""CORED"": C, O, R, E, D -> same.\n\n But we don\'t know if the word has O, U, etc.\n\n Another: ""PERKY"" -> P, E, R, K, Y -> E in 2, R in 3 -> but we have E in position 2? That\'s allowed. And R in 3. Also, no A, I, S.\n\n However, we are also testing P, K, Y.\n\n We want to cover common letters. Common consonants: T, N, L, etc. Vowels: O, U, E (we already have E) and we know A is out.\n\n Since we have E, we can try to use other vowels: O, U.\n\n I think ""TREND"" is a good choice because it uses common letters (T, R, E, N, D) and we can get information about T, N, D.\n\n But note: in ""TREND"", we have:\n   T in position 1 -> we don\'t know if T is in the word.\n   R in position 2 -> we know R is in the word, but if it\'s in position 2 we get feedback.\n   E in position 3 -> we know E is in the word, but if it\'s in position 3 we get feedback.\n   N in position 4 -> test N.\n   D in position 5 -> test D.\n\n Also, we avoid A, I, S.\n\n So I will go with ""TREND"".\n\n But wait: what if the secret word has two R\'s? We don\'t know. But we are using R only once. Similarly for E.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t put R and E in the same positions as the first guess? We had R at 1 and E at 5, so now we are putting R at 2 and E at 3? That\'s different.\n\n Let me confirm: the first guess had R at 1 and E at 5. Now we are trying R at 2 and E at 3.\n\n So, I think ""TREND"" is a good second guess.\n\n However, note that the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 3, that\'s a new position.\n\n Let\'s go with ""TREND"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R is in the secret word but not in position 1.\n- E is in the secret word but not in position 5.\n- A, I, and S are not in the secret word.\n\nFor the next guess, I need to:\n1. Avoid using A, I, or S.\n2. Include R and E (since they are confirmed in the word).\n3. Place R in a position other than 1 (e.g., positions 2–5).\n4. Place E in a position other than 5 (e.g., positions 1–4).\n5. Test new common letters (like T, N, D) to gather more information.\n\nA strong candidate is **""TREND""**:\n- T (new letter), R (in position 2), E (in position 3), N (new letter), D (new letter).\n- It avoids A/I/S and repositions R and E based on feedback.\n- This tests high-frequency consonants (T, N, D) while leveraging known letters.\n\n<guess>TREND</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: TREND -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE -> R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nMeaning:\n- R is in the word but not in position 1.\n- A, I, S are not in the word.\n- E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: TREND -> T(-) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)\nMeaning:\n- T is in the word but not in position 1.\n- R is in the word but not in position 2.\n- E is in the word but not in position 3.\n- N and D are not in the word.\n\nNow, combining the information:\n\nLetters NOT in the word: A, I, S, N, D.\nLetters IN the word: R, E, T.\n\nAdditionally, we know positions where letters cannot be:\n- R is not in position 1 (from Guess 1) and not in position 2 (from Guess 2).\n- E is not in position 5 (from Guess 1) and not in position 3 (from Guess 2).\n- T is not in position 1 (from Guess 2).\n\nThe secret word is 5 letters and must contain R, E, T, and two additional letters that we haven\'t tested or that are confirmed (but we don\'t know yet).\n\nWe have tested the letters: R, A, I, S, E, T, R, E, N, D (from both guesses).

But also, R is in pos5? R can be at pos5.\n\nBut note: we also have to avoid N and D? ""ETHER"" has E, T, H, E, R. So letters: E, T, H, R. H is not excluded.\n\nBut wait, does it have two E\'s? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know. The feedback hasn\'t indicated duplicates yet, but it\'s possible.\n\nHowever, in the first guess, E was tested and marked as ""-"" meaning it\'s in the word but not at pos5. In the second guess, E was at pos3 and marked ""-"", meaning it\'s in the word but not at pos3. So the E could be the same E? Or a different E? It could be the same E, meaning it must be in a position that is not 3 or 5. So positions 1,2,4.\n\nIf there is only one E, then in ""ETHER"", it has E at pos1 and pos4? Then the word has two E\'s.

We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: - (in word, not position 1)
- A: x (not in word)
- I: x (not in word)
- S: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, not position 5)

Guess 2: TREND
- T: - (in word, not position 1)
- R: - (in word, not position 2)
- E: - (in word, not position 3)
- N: x (not in word)
- D: x (not in word)

Guess 3: METRO
- M: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, not position 2)  [since it was in position 2 and got ""-""]
- T: ✓ (in word and correct position, so T is in position 3)
- R: - (in word, not position 4)  [since it was in position 4 and got ""-""]
- O: - (in word, not position 5)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. Letters in the word: R, E, T, O (from the feedback, all have been marked as present in some way)
   - R: present, but not in positions 1, 2, or 4 (from guesses 1, 2, and 3)
   - E: present, but not in positions 5 (from guess 1), 3 (from guess 2), or 2 (from guess 3). So E cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5. The only positions left are 1 and 4.
   - T: present and we know it is in position 3 (from guess 3, T is correct at position 3).
   - O: present, but not in position 5 (from guess 3).

2. Letters not in the word: A, I, S, N, D, M (from the x's in all guesses).

3. We have 5 positions. We know T is fixed at position 3.

4. E must be in position 1 or 4 (since it can't be in 2,3,5).

5. R must be in position 3 or 5? But position 3 is taken by T. So R cannot be in position 3. Therefore, R must be in position 5? Because the only positions left for R are 3,4,5 and we know not 1,2,4. So 3 and 5? But 3 is taken by T, so R must be in position 5.

   However, let's list the positions for R:
   - Not in 1 (guess1), not in 2 (guess2), not in 4 (guess3). So possible: 3 or 5.
   But position 3 is occupied by T (fixed). Therefore, R must be in position 5.

6. Now, we have:
   Position 3: T (fixed)
   Position 5: R (since it must be there)

7. E must be in position 1 or 4.

8. We have one more letter to find (since the word has 5 letters, and we have R, E, T, O, and one more). But wait, we have four letters: R, E, T, O. So we need one more letter.

   The word must have five distinct letters? Not necessarily, but so far we haven't seen duplicates. However, we must consider the possibility of duplicates, but let's proceed with distinct for now.

9. The known letters are R, E, T, O, and one unknown. But we also have to place O. O is in the word but not in position 5 (from guess3). So O can be in positions 1,2,3,4? But position 3 is T, so O can be in 1,2,4.

10. Now, let's consider the positions:

    Position 1: Could be E or O or the new letter? But E can be in 1 or 4, and O can be in 1,2,4.

    Position 2: Open for O or the new letter? But E cannot be in 2 (from guess3), so position 2 must be either O or the new letter.

    Position 4: Could be E or O or the new letter? But E can be in 4, and O can be in 4.

    However, we have to assign E to either 1 or 4.

    Also, we have to assign O to one of 1,2,4 (but not 5, and 3 is taken).

    And we have one more letter to place in the remaining position.

11. We also know that the word has O, so we must include it.

    Let me denote the positions:

    Pos1: ?
    Pos2: ?
    Pos3: T
    Pos4: ?
    Pos5: R

    And E must be in pos1 or pos4.

    O must be in pos1, 2, or 4 (but not 5, and 3 is taken).

    Now, if E is in pos1, then:
        Pos1: E
        Then O can be in pos2 or pos4.
        And the remaining position (either 2 or 4) and the other one (if O is in 2, then 4 is open; if O is in 4, then 2 is open) must be the new letter.

    If E is in pos4, then:
        Pos4: E
        Then O can be in pos1 or pos2.
        And the remaining position (1 or 2) must be the new letter.

12. We need to choose a word that fits and tests the possibilities.

    Also, we must avoid the excluded letters: A, I, S, N, D, M.

    Let's think of words that end with R, have T in the middle, and contain E and O.

    Possibilities:

    Option 1: E in pos1, O in pos2 -> then pos4 is the new letter. Word: E O T ? R
        Example: EOTHR? But H is not excluded, but is it a word? ""EOTHR"" is not a word. 
        What about ""EATER""? But A is excluded -> invalid.
        ""ENTER""? N excluded -> invalid.
        ""ELTOR""? L not excluded, but is it a word? ""ELTOR"" is not a word.

    Option 2: E in pos1, O in pos4 -> then pos2 is the new letter. Word: E ? T O R
        This is a common pattern: e.g., ""ECTOR"" (not a word), ""ELTOR"" (no), but ""ECTOR"" isn't valid. 
        What about ""EDITOR""? Too long. We need 5 letters: E _ T O R.
        Examples: ""ECTOR"" not word, ""EKTOR"" not word. 
        Actually, ""ECTOR"" is not a word. But we have ""METRO"" which we already tried? No, we tried METRO and it had M which is excluded.

        Let me think: common words ending in TOR? Like ""VOTER"", but V is not excluded. ""VOTER"": V, O, T, E, R -> but E is in pos4? In ""VOTER"", it's V-O-T-E-R, so E is in pos4? But we are considering E in pos1? This is for the pattern E _ T O R, which is not the same.

        For E _ T O R: the letters are E (1), ? (2), T (3), O (4), R (5). So the word must be of the form E?TOR.

        Examples: ""ECTOR"" no, ""EATOR"" no (and A excluded), ""EDITOR"" is 6 letters. 
        Actually, I can't think of a common word with E?TOR. 

        How about ""EPTOR""? Not a word. 

        So maybe E in pos1 and O in pos4 is not common.

    Option 3: E in pos4, O in pos1 -> then pos2 is the new letter. Word: O ? T E R
        This is the pattern: O _ T E R. 
        Examples: ""OTTER"" -> but T is repeated? ""OTTER"" has two T's. 
        In ""OTTER"": O, T, T, E, R -> but we have T at position 3 and also at position 2? That would be two T's. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in our feedback, we haven't seen a duplicate yet, but it's possible.

        But let's check: in guess3, we had T at position 3 and it was correct. If the word has T at position 2 as well, then in guess2 (TREND) we had T at position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That would be consistent because T is in the word but not at 1 (it's at 2 and 3). But in guess2, we only had one T and it was at position 1, so the feedback doesn't tell us about multiple T's. It could be.

        However, in ""OTTER"", we have T at position 2 and 3. But we already have T at position 3 fixed, so if we put T at position 2, that would be a duplicate. But we are trying to avoid duplicates? We don't have to, but let's see.

        But in this pattern, we are putting O at 1, then a letter at 2, then T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

        So the word is O ? T E R.

        Common words: ""OTTER"" (if the second letter is T) -> but then we have two T's. 
        Other words: ""OATER"" -> but A is excluded. 
        ""OCTER"" not a word. 
        ""OMTER"" not a word. 
        ""ONTER"" not a word and N excluded. 
        ""OTHER"": O, T, H, E, R -> but T is at position 2? In ""OTHER"", it's O-T-H-E-R, so position 2 is T? But we have T at position 3 fixed. So if we put T at position 2, that would be a duplicate T? But the word ""OTHER"" has only one T? No, ""OTHER"" has one T at position 2. But we need T at position 3? So that would be two T's? Not in ""OTHER"". 

        Actually, ""OTHER"" has O in 1, T in 2, H in 3, E in 4, R in 5. But we need T in position 3. So that doesn't match.

        We need a word with O at 1, then a letter (say X) at 2, then T at 3, E at 4, R at 5: O X T E R.

        Examples: ""OTTER"" has O, T, T, E, R -> so positions: O(1), T(2), T(3), E(4), R(5). That works, and it has two T's.

        But is ""OTTER"" a valid word? Yes.

        Now, check against feedback:
        - We have T at position 3 (correct) and also at position 2? But in guess2, we had T at position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That would be consistent because T is in the word (at 2 and 3) but not at 1.

        Also, in guess3, we had T at position 3 and it was correct.

        Now, what about the letters: O is present (we know from guess3) and in this word it's at position 1. In guess3, O was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position (O(-)), so that matches because O is not at 5.

        E is at position 4: we know E cannot be at 2,3,5, so 4 is allowed.

        R at position 5: we know R must be at 5 (as deduced).

        And the word has no excluded letters: A,I,S,N,D,M are out, and ""OTTER"" has O,T,E,R (T repeated) so no excluded.

        But we have two T's? Is that a problem? The feedback doesn't rule out duplicates.

        However, we have to consider if there is a word without duplicate T? Because we haven't confirmed duplicates.

        But let's see the other option.

    Option 4: E in pos4, O in pos2 -> then pos1 is the new letter. Word: ? O T E R
        Pattern: ? O T E R
        Examples: ""COTER"" not common, ""DOTER"" not word, ""HOTER"" not word, ""LOTER"" not word, ""MOTER"" not word (and M excluded), ""POTER"" not word, ""ROTER"" not word, ""TOTER"" -> ""TOTER"" is not a word, but ""TOTER"" might be a misspelling. 
        Actually, ""VOTER"": V O T E R -> but then E is at position 4? In ""VOTER"", it's V-O-T-E-R, so E is at 4? But we have E at 4? And R at 5? And T at 3? Yes. 
        But what about the first letter? V is not excluded.

        So ""VOTER"" is a candidate.

        In ""VOTER"":
          Pos1: V
          Pos2: O
          Pos3: T
          Pos4: E
          Pos5: R

        This satisfies:
          E is in pos4 (allowed: not 2,3,5)
          O is in pos2 (allowed: not 5, and 3 is taken)
          R is in pos5 (allowed: not 1,2,4)
          T is in pos3 (correct)

        And we have V as the new letter.

        Also, no duplicate letters.

        Now, we have two candidates: ""OTTER"" (with duplicate T) and ""VOTER"" (with V).

        But we need to see which one is more likely? Or we can test.

        However, we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 out of 6). We need to choose one.

        But note: in ""OTTER"", we have two T's. In our previous guesses, we have only tested T in position 1 and 3. In position 1 it was wrong, in position 3 it was correct. But if there is a T in position 2, we haven't tested that position for T. So we don't know.

        Similarly, for ""VOTER"", we have V which we haven't tested.

        How can we distinguish?

        Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests the possibilities without committing to one.

        But we have to include the known letters: R, E, T, O. And we know R is at 5, T at 3, and E must be at 1 or 4, and O at 1,2,4 (but not 3,5).

        Since we have two scenarios, we can try to guess a word that covers both possibilities? But it's hard.

        Let's list the constraints again:

        We know:
          Pos3: T
          Pos5: R

        E must be in 1 or 4.

        O must be in 1,2,4.

        And the remaining position (either 1,2, or 4) is the new letter.

        Actually, if E is in 1, then O can be in 2 or 4, and the other is new.
        If E is in 4, then O can be in 1 or 2, and the other is new.

        So the unknown positions are 1,2,4, but with constraints.

        We can try to guess a word that has E in position 4 and O in position 2, for example, and a new letter in position 1? That would be ""VOTER"" as above.

        Or if we put E in position 1 and O in position 2, then we have E O T ? R, and we need a letter for position 4. What letter? We haven't tested many consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

        For example, ""LOTER"" is not a word, but ""HOTER"" not word. ""DOTER"" not word. ""COTER"" not word. ""POTER"" not word. ""MOTER"" not word. ""NOTER"" -> N is excluded. ""ROTER"" not word. ""BOTER"" not word. ""GOTER"" not word. ""YOTER"" not word. 

        Actually, I cannot find a common word for E O T ? R. The only common word I know with that ending is ""VOTER"" but that has V at the beginning and O at 2, not E at 1.

        So perhaps E in position 1 is not possible? Then E must be in position 4.

        And then O must be in position 1 or 2.

        If O is in position 1, then we have O ? T E R, and we need a letter for position 2. The only common word I can think of is ""OTTER"" (with T at 2 and 3) or ""OTHER"" but that has H at 3, not T.

        ""OTHER"" has H at 3, but we need T at 3. So that doesn't work.

        So if O is in position 1, then position 2 must be T? But then we have two T's: ""OTTER"". 

        If O is in position 2, then we have ? O T E R, and the first letter is the new letter. Then ""VOTER"" is a word.

        So the two possibilities are:
          - ""OTTER"" (O, T, T, E, R) with T at 2 and 3.
          - ""VOTER"" (V, O, T, E, R) with V at 1.

        Now, how to choose? We can try to guess one of them.

        But note: in ""OTTER"", we have two T's. In our previous guess (guess2: TREND), we had T at position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That would be consistent with T being at 2 and 3 (so not at 1). Also, in guess3, we had T at 3 and it was correct.

        For ""VOTER"", we have V at 1, which we haven't tested.

        We can try to guess ""VOTER"" to test the V. If it's not, then we can fall back to ""OTTER"".

        But we have two guesses left? We are about to make guess 4, and we have 6 total, so we have two more after this.

        Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the position for E and O without guessing the entire word? But we have to include the known letters.

        However, we know T and R are fixed, so we have to build around them.

        Let me think of a word that has:
          Pos3: T
          Pos5: R
          E in position 4 (since we suspect E is in 4, because E in 1 seems difficult)
          O in position 1? Then we need a letter for position 2. But we don't know what that is. Or O in position 2? Then we need a letter for position 1.

        And we want to test a new letter.

        But if we choose ""VOTER"", we are testing V and also confirming the positions for O, E, T, R.

        Similarly, if we choose ""OTTER"", we are testing the duplicate T.

        But to avoid risking a duplicate if it doesn't exist, maybe ""VOTER"" is safer? And if ""VOTER"" is wrong, then we know it must be ""OTTER"".

        Also, we can check: in guess3, we had O at position 5 and it was marked as present but not at 5. In ""VOTER"", O is at position 2, which is new. In ""OTTER"", O is at position 1, which is also new.

        So both are possible.

        I think ""VOTER"" is a valid word and fits all the constraints, so I'll go with that.

        But let's confirm the feedback we would get if the word is ""VOTER"":

        Guess: VOTER
          V: new letter, if the word is ""VOTER"", then V is correct at position 1 -> ✓
          O: in the word but not at position 5? In ""VOTER"", O is at 2, so if we guess VOTER, then O is at 2, which is not 5, so it would be -? But actually, if it's in the correct position, it should be ✓. 

        The feedback for O: in guess3, O was at position 5 and got ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not at 5. Now, if we put O at position 2 and it is correct, then we should get ✓.

        Similarly, T at 3 is ✓, E at 4: if the word is ""VOTER"", E is at 4 and that is correct? In ""VOTER"", E is at 4? V-O-T-E-R, so E is at 4. And we know E can be at 4. So it would be ✓.

        R at 5: ✓.

        So if the word is ""VOTER"", we would get all ✓ except V? But V is at 1 and if it's correct, then ✓. So all correct.

        But if the word is ""OTTER"", then ""VOTER"" would have V at 1 which is not in the word (since ""OTTER"" has O at 1, not V), so V would be x. Then O at 2: in ""OTTER"", O is at 1, so O is in the word but not at 2? So O would be -. T at 3: ✓. E at 4: ✓ (because ""OTTER"" has E at 4). R at 5: ✓.

        So we can distinguish.

        Therefore, I'll guess ""VOTER"".

        If it's not, then the only other possibility is ""OTTER"".

        But are there other words? For example, with E in position 4 and O in position 1, and a letter in position 2? We have ""OTTER"" (with T in 2) or is there another? Like ""OATER"" but A excluded. ""OCTER"" not word. So probably only ""OTTER"".

        What about E in position 4 and O in position 2, and a different letter in 1? Like ""VOTER"", but also ""DOTER"" not word, ""COTER"" not word, ""HOTER"" not word, ""POTER"" not word, ""YOTER"" not word. ""WOTER"" not word. ""XOTER"" not word. ""ZOTER"" not word. ""BOTER"" not word. ""GOTER"" not word. ""LOTER"" not word. ""NOTER"" not word and N excluded. So only ""VOTER"" is common.

        Therefore, the two candidates are ""VOTER"" and ""OTTER"".

        I'll go with ""VOTER"" as the next guess.

        But note: we have to make sure we don't violate any constraints.

        In ""VOTER"":
          V: not excluded? Yes.
          O: in word and not at 5? We know O is in the word (from guess3) and we are putting it at 2, which is allowed.
          T: at 3, correct.
          E: at 4, which is allowed (E not at 2,3,5 -> 4 is allowed).
          R: at 5, which is required.

        So it's a valid guess.

        Let's make the guess: ""VOTER""

        If it's not correct, then we can guess ""OTTER"" next.

        But we have two more guesses after this? We are on guess 4, so we have 5 and 6 left.

        So I think it's safe.

        Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests the presence of V? But we are already doing that with ""VOTER"".

        So I'll go with ""VOTER"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **RAISE**: R (wrong position), E (wrong position), A/I/S not in word.
- **TREND**: T (wrong position), R (wrong position), E (wrong position), N/D not in word.
- **METRO**: M not in word, E (wrong position), T (correct position), R (wrong position), O (wrong position).

### Deductions:
1. **Confirmed letters in secret word**: 
   - **T** is in position 3 (✓ from METRO).
   - **R**, **E**, and **O** are present but not in tested positions.
   - **Absent letters**: A, I, S, N, D, M.

2. **Position constraints**:
   - **R**: Cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (feedback from RAISE, TREND, METRO). Must be in position 5 (only remaining option).
   - **E**: Cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (feedback from METRO, TREND, RAISE). Must be in position 1 or 4.
   - **O**: Cannot be in position 5 (feedback from METRO). Must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

3. **Word structure**:
   - Position 3: **T** (fixed).
   - Position 5: **R** (deduced).
   - Positions 1, 2, 4: **E** must be in 1 or 4, **O** in 1/2/4, and one unknown letter.

4. **Possible candidates**:
   - **VOTER**: V (new letter), O (position 2), T (position 3), E (position 4), R (position 5).  
     Fits all constraints: E in position 4 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), R in position 5 (required), and tests V.
   - **OTTER**: O (position 1), T (position 2 and 3), E (position 4), R (position 5).  
     Requires duplicate T, but possible if the secret word has two T's.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **VOTER** is prioritized to test:
  - Whether **E** is in position 4 (if correct, E gets ✓).
  - Whether **O** is in position 2 (if correct, O gets ✓).
  - Whether **V** is in the word (if absent, V gets x).
- If **VOTER** is incorrect, **OTTER** will be the next guess (testing duplicate T).

<guess>VOTER</guess>",VOTER,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: - (in word, not position 1)
- A: x (not in word)
- I: x (not in word)
- S: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, not position 5)

Guess 2: TREND
- T: - (in word, not position 1)
- R: - (in word, not position 2)
- E: - (in word, not position 3)
- N: x (not in word)
- D: x (not in word)

Guess 3: METRO
- M: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, not position 2)  [since it was in position 2 and got ""-""]
- T: ✓ (in word and correct position, so T is in position 3)
- R: - (in word, not position 4)  [since it was in position 4 and got ""-""]
- O: - (in word, not position 5)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. Letters in the word: R, E, T, O (from the feedback, all have been marked as present in some way)
   - R: present, but not in positions 1, 2, or 4 (from guesses 1, 2, and 3)
   - E: present, but not in positions 5 (from guess 1), 3 (from guess 2), or 2 (from guess 3). So E cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5. The only positions left are 1 and 4.
   - T: present and we know it is in position 3 (from guess 3, T is correct at position 3).
   - O: present, but not in position 5 (from guess 3).

2. Letters not in the word: A, I, S, N, D, M (from the x's in all guesses).

3. We have 5 positions. We know T is fixed at position 3.

4. E must be in position 1 or 4 (since it can't be in 2,3,5).

5. R must be in position 3 or 5? But position 3 is taken by T. So R cannot be in position 3. Therefore, R must be in position 5? Because the only positions left for R are 3,4,5 and we know not 1,2,4. So 3 and 5? But 3 is taken by T, so R must be in position 5.

   However, let's list the positions for R:
   - Not in 1 (guess1), not in 2 (guess2), not in 4 (guess3). So possible: 3 or 5.
   But position 3 is occupied by T (fixed). Therefore, R must be in position 5.

6. Now, we have:
   Position 3: T (fixed)
   Position 5: R (since it must be there)

7. E must be in position 1 or 4.

8. We have one more letter to find (since the word has 5 letters, and we have R, E, T, O, and one more). But wait, we have four letters: R, E, T, O. So we need one more letter.

   The word must have five distinct letters? Not necessarily, but so far we haven't seen duplicates. However, we must consider the possibility of duplicates, but let's proceed with distinct for now.

9. The known letters are R, E, T, O, and one unknown. But we also have to place O. O is in the word but not in position 5 (from guess3). So O can be in positions 1,2,3,4? But position 3 is T, so O can be in 1,2,4.

10. Now, let's consider the positions:

    Position 1: Could be E or O or the new letter? But E can be in 1 or 4, and O can be in 1,2,4.

    Position 2: Open for O or the new letter? But E cannot be in 2 (from guess3), so position 2 must be either O or the new letter.

    Position 4: Could be E or O or the new letter? But E can be in 4, and O can be in 4.

    However, we have to assign E to either 1 or 4.

    Also, we have to assign O to one of 1,2,4 (but not 5, and 3 is taken).

    And we have one more letter to place in the remaining position.

11. We also know that the word has O, so we must include it.

    Let me denote the positions:

    Pos1: ?
    Pos2: ?
    Pos3: T
    Pos4: ?
    Pos5: R

    And E must be in pos1 or pos4.

    O must be in pos1, 2, or 4 (but not 5, and 3 is taken).

    Now, if E is in pos1, then:
        Pos1: E
        Then O can be in pos2 or pos4.
        And the remaining position (either 2 or 4) and the other one (if O is in 2, then 4 is open; if O is in 4, then 2 is open) must be the new letter.

    If E is in pos4, then:
        Pos4: E
        Then O can be in pos1 or pos2.
        And the remaining position (1 or 2) must be the new letter.

12. We need to choose a word that fits and tests the possibilities.

    Also, we must avoid the excluded letters: A, I, S, N, D, M.

    Let's think of words that end with R, have T in the middle, and contain E and O.

    Possibilities:

    Option 1: E in pos1, O in pos2 -> then pos4 is the new letter. Word: E O T ? R
        Example: EOTHR? But H is not excluded, but is it a word? ""EOTHR"" is not a word. 
        What about ""EATER""? But A is excluded -> invalid.
        ""ENTER""? N excluded -> invalid.
        ""ELTOR""? L not excluded, but is it a word? ""ELTOR"" is not a word.

    Option 2: E in pos1, O in pos4 -> then pos2 is the new letter. Word: E ? T O R
        This is a common pattern: e.g., ""ECTOR"" (not a word), ""ELTOR"" (no), but ""ECTOR"" isn't valid. 
        What about ""EDITOR""? Too long. We need 5 letters: E _ T O R.
        Examples: ""ECTOR"" not word, ""EKTOR"" not word. 
        Actually, ""ECTOR"" is not a word. But we have ""METRO"" which we already tried? No, we tried METRO and it had M which is excluded.

        Let me think: common words ending in TOR? Like ""VOTER"", but V is not excluded. ""VOTER"": V, O, T, E, R -> but E is in pos4? In ""VOTER"", it's V-O-T-E-R, so E is in pos4? But we are considering E in pos1? This is for the pattern E _ T O R, which is not the same.

        For E _ T O R: the letters are E (1), ? (2), T (3), O (4), R (5). So the word must be of the form E?TOR.

        Examples: ""ECTOR"" no, ""EATOR"" no (and A excluded), ""EDITOR"" is 6 letters. 
        Actually, I can't think of a common word with E?TOR. 

        How about ""EPTOR""? Not a word. 

        So maybe E in pos1 and O in pos4 is not common.

    Option 3: E in pos4, O in pos1 -> then pos2 is the new letter. Word: O ? T E R
        This is the pattern: O _ T E R. 
        Examples: ""OTTER"" -> but T is repeated? ""OTTER"" has two T's. 
        In ""OTTER"": O, T, T, E, R -> but we have T at position 3 and also at position 2? That would be two T's. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in our feedback, we haven't seen a duplicate yet, but it's possible.

        But let's check: in guess3, we had T at position 3 and it was correct. If the word has T at position 2 as well, then in guess2 (TREND) we had T at position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That would be consistent because T is in the word but not at 1 (it's at 2 and 3). But in guess2, we only had one T and it was at position 1, so the feedback doesn't tell us about multiple T's. It could be.

        However, in ""OTTER"", we have T at position 2 and 3. But we already have T at position 3 fixed, so if we put T at position 2, that would be a duplicate. But we are trying to avoid duplicates? We don't have to, but let's see.

        But in this pattern, we are putting O at 1, then a letter at 2, then T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

        So the word is O ? T E R.

        Common words: ""OTTER"" (if the second letter is T) -> but then we have two T's. 
        Other words: ""OATER"" -> but A is excluded. 
        ""OCTER"" not a word. 
        ""OMTER"" not a word. 
        ""ONTER"" not a word and N excluded. 
        ""OTHER"": O, T, H, E, R -> but T is at position 2? In ""OTHER"", it's O-T-H-E-R, so position 2 is T? But we have T at position 3 fixed. So if we put T at position 2, that would be a duplicate T? But the word ""OTHER"" has only one T? No, ""OTHER"" has one T at position 2. But we need T at position 3? So that would be two T's? Not in ""OTHER"". 

        Actually, ""OTHER"" has O in 1, T in 2, H in 3, E in 4, R in 5. But we need T in position 3. So that doesn't match.

        We need a word with O at 1, then a letter (say X) at 2, then T at 3, E at 4, R at 5: O X T E R.

        Examples: ""OTTER"" has O, T, T, E, R -> so positions: O(1), T(2), T(3), E(4), R(5). That works, and it has two T's.

        But is ""OTTER"" a valid word? Yes.

        Now, check against feedback:
        - We have T at position 3 (correct) and also at position 2? But in guess2, we had T at position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That would be consistent because T is in the word (at 2 and 3) but not at 1.

        Also, in guess3, we had T at position 3 and it was correct.

        Now, what about the letters: O is present (we know from guess3) and in this word it's at position 1. In guess3, O was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position (O(-)), so that matches because O is not at 5.

        E is at position 4: we know E cannot be at 2,3,5, so 4 is allowed.

        R at position 5: we know R must be at 5 (as deduced).

        And the word has no excluded letters: A,I,S,N,D,M are out, and ""OTTER"" has O,T,E,R (T repeated) so no excluded.

        But we have two T's? Is that a problem? The feedback doesn't rule out duplicates.

        However, we have to consider if there is a word without duplicate T? Because we haven't confirmed duplicates.

        But let's see the other option.

    Option 4: E in pos4, O in pos2 -> then pos1 is the new letter. Word: ? O T E R
        Pattern: ? O T E R
        Examples: ""COTER"" not common, ""DOTER"" not word, ""HOTER"" not word, ""LOTER"" not word, ""MOTER"" not word (and M excluded), ""POTER"" not word, ""ROTER"" not word, ""TOTER"" -> ""TOTER"" is not a word, but ""TOTER"" might be a misspelling. 
        Actually, ""VOTER"": V O T E R -> but then E is at position 4? In ""VOTER"", it's V-O-T-E-R, so E is at 4? But we have E at 4? And R at 5? And T at 3? Yes. 
        But what about the first letter? V is not excluded.

        So ""VOTER"" is a candidate.

        In ""VOTER"":
          Pos1: V
          Pos2: O
          Pos3: T
          Pos4: E
          Pos5: R

        This satisfies:
          E is in pos4 (allowed: not 2,3,5)
          O is in pos2 (allowed: not 5, and 3 is taken)
          R is in pos5 (allowed: not 1,2,4)
          T is in pos3 (correct)

        And we have V as the new letter.

        Also, no duplicate letters.

        Now, we have two candidates: ""OTTER"" (with duplicate T) and ""VOTER"" (with V).

        But we need to see which one is more likely? Or we can test.

        However, we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 out of 6). We need to choose one.

        But note: in ""OTTER"", we have two T's. In our previous guesses, we have only tested T in position 1 and 3. In position 1 it was wrong, in position 3 it was correct. But if there is a T in position 2, we haven't tested that position for T. So we don't know.

        Similarly, for ""VOTER"", we have V which we haven't tested.

        How can we distinguish?

        Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests the possibilities without committing to one.

        But we have to include the known letters: R, E, T, O. And we know R is at 5, T at 3, and E must be at 1 or 4, and O at 1,2,4 (but not 3,5).

        Since we have two scenarios, we can try to guess a word that covers both possibilities? But it's hard.

        Let's list the constraints again:

        We know:
          Pos3: T
          Pos5: R

        E must be in 1 or 4.

        O must be in 1,2,4.

        And the remaining position (either 1,2, or 4) is the new letter.

        Actually, if E is in 1, then O can be in 2 or 4, and the other is new.
        If E is in 4, then O can be in 1 or 2, and the other is new.

        So the unknown positions are 1,2,4, but with constraints.

        We can try to guess a word that has E in position 4 and O in position 2, for example, and a new letter in position 1? That would be ""VOTER"" as above.

        Or if we put E in position 1 and O in position 2, then we have E O T ? R, and we need a letter for position 4. What letter? We haven't tested many consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

        For example, ""LOTER"" is not a word, but ""HOTER"" not word. ""DOTER"" not word. ""COTER"" not word. ""POTER"" not word. ""MOTER"" not word. ""NOTER"" -> N is excluded. ""ROTER"" not word. ""BOTER"" not word. ""GOTER"" not word. ""YOTER"" not word. 

        Actually, I cannot find a common word for E O T ? R. The only common word I know with that ending is ""VOTER"" but that has V at the beginning and O at 2, not E at 1.

        So perhaps E in position 1 is not possible? Then E must be in position 4.

        And then O must be in position 1 or 2.

        If O is in position 1, then we have O ? T E R, and we need a letter for position 2. The only common word I can think of is ""OTTER"" (with T at 2 and 3) or ""OTHER"" but that has H at 3, not T.

        ""OTHER"" has H at 3, but we need T at 3. So that doesn't work.

        So if O is in position 1, then position 2 must be T? But then we have two T's: ""OTTER"". 

        If O is in position 2, then we have ? O T E R, and the first letter is the new letter. Then ""VOTER"" is a word.

        So the two possibilities are:
          - ""OTTER"" (O, T, T, E, R) with T at 2 and 3.
          - ""VOTER"" (V, O, T, E, R) with V at 1.

        Now, how to choose? We can try to guess one of them.

        But note: in ""OTTER"", we have two T's. In our previous guess (guess2: TREND), we had T at position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That would be consistent with T being at 2 and 3 (so not at 1). Also, in guess3, we had T at 3 and it was correct.

        For ""VOTER"", we have V at 1, which we haven't tested.

        We can try to guess ""VOTER"" to test the V. If it's not, then we can fall back to ""OTTER"".

        But we have two guesses left? We are about to make guess 4, and we have 6 total, so we have two more after this.

        Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the position for E and O without guessing the entire word? But we have to include the known letters.

        However, we know T and R are fixed, so we have to build around them.

        Let me think of a word that has:
          Pos3: T
          Pos5: R
          E in position 4 (since we suspect E is in 4, because E in 1 seems difficult)
          O in position 1? Then we need a letter for position 2. But we don't know what that is. Or O in position 2? Then we need a letter for position 1.

        And we want to test a new letter.

        But if we choose ""VOTER"", we are testing V and also confirming the positions for O, E, T, R.

        Similarly, if we choose ""OTTER"", we are testing the duplicate T.

        But to avoid risking a duplicate if it doesn't exist, maybe ""VOTER"" is safer? And if ""VOTER"" is wrong, then we know it must be ""OTTER"".

        Also, we can check: in guess3, we had O at position 5 and it was marked as present but not at 5. In ""VOTER"", O is at position 2, which is new. In ""OTTER"", O is at position 1, which is also new.

        So both are possible.

        I think ""VOTER"" is a valid word and fits all the constraints, so I'll go with that.

        But let's confirm the feedback we would get if the word is ""VOTER"":

        Guess: VOTER
          V: new letter, if the word is ""VOTER"", then V is correct at position 1 -> ✓
          O: in the word but not at position 5? In ""VOTER"", O is at 2, so if we guess VOTER, then O is at 2, which is not 5, so it would be -? But actually, if it's in the correct position, it should be ✓. 

        The feedback for O: in guess3, O was at position 5 and got ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not at 5. Now, if we put O at position 2 and it is correct, then we should get ✓.

        Similarly, T at 3 is ✓, E at 4: if the word is ""VOTER"", E is at 4 and that is correct? In ""VOTER"", E is at 4? V-O-T-E-R, so E is at 4. And we know E can be at 4. So it would be ✓.

        R at 5: ✓.

        So if the word is ""VOTER"", we would get all ✓ except V? But V is at 1 and if it's correct, then ✓. So all correct.

        But if the word is ""OTTER"", then ""VOTER"" would have V at 1 which is not in the word (since ""OTTER"" has O at 1, not V), so V would be x. Then O at 2: in ""OTTER"", O is at 1, so O is in the word but not at 2? So O would be -. T at 3: ✓. E at 4: ✓ (because ""OTTER"" has E at 4). R at 5: ✓.

        So we can distinguish.

        Therefore, I'll guess ""VOTER"".

        If it's not, then the only other possibility is ""OTTER"".

        But are there other words? For example, with E in position 4 and O in position 1, and a letter in position 2? We have ""OTTER"" (with T in 2) or is there another? Like ""OATER"" but A excluded. ""OCTER"" not word. So probably only ""OTTER"".

        What about E in position 4 and O in position 2, and a different letter in 1? Like ""VOTER"", but also ""DOTER"" not word, ""COTER"" not word, ""HOTER"" not word, ""POTER"" not word, ""YOTER"" not word. ""WOTER"" not word. ""XOTER"" not word. ""ZOTER"" not word. ""BOTER"" not word. ""GOTER"" not word. ""LOTER"" not word. ""NOTER"" not word and N excluded. So only ""VOTER"" is common.

        Therefore, the two candidates are ""VOTER"" and ""OTTER"".

        I'll go with ""VOTER"" as the next guess.

        But note: we have to make sure we don't violate any constraints.

        In ""VOTER"":
          V: not excluded? Yes.
          O: in word and not at 5? We know O is in the word (from guess3) and we are putting it at 2, which is allowed.
          T: at 3, correct.
          E: at 4, which is allowed (E not at 2,3,5 -> 4 is allowed).
          R: at 5, which is required.

        So it's a valid guess.

        Let's make the guess: ""VOTER""

        If it's not correct, then we can guess ""OTTER"" next.

        But we have two more guesses after this? We are on guess 4, so we have 5 and 6 left.

        So I think it's safe.

        Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests the presence of V? But we are already doing that with ""VOTER"".

        So I'll go with ""VOTER"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **RAISE**: R (wrong position), E (wrong position), A/I/S not in word.
- **TREND**: T (wrong position), R (wrong position), E (wrong position), N/D not in word.
- **METRO**: M not in word, E (wrong position), T (correct position), R (wrong position), O (wrong position).

### Deductions:
1. **Confirmed letters in secret word**: 
   - **T** is in position 3 (✓ from METRO).
   - **R**, **E**, and **O** are present but not in tested positions.
   - **Absent letters**: A, I, S, N, D, M.

2. **Position constraints**:
   - **R**: Cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (feedback from RAISE, TREND, METRO). Must be in position 5 (only remaining option).
   - **E**: Cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (feedback from METRO, TREND, RAISE). Must be in position 1 or 4.
   - **O**: Cannot be in position 5 (feedback from METRO). Must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

3. **Word structure**:
   - Position 3: **T** (fixed).
   - Position 5: **R** (deduced).
   - Positions 1, 2, 4: **E** must be in 1 or 4, **O** in 1/2/4, and one unknown letter.

4. **Possible candidates**:
   - **VOTER**: V (new letter), O (position 2), T (position 3), E (position 4), R (position 5).  
     Fits all constraints: E in position 4 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), R in position 5 (required), and tests V.
   - **OTTER**: O (position 1), T (position 2 and 3), E (position 4), R (position 5).  
     Requires duplicate T, but possible if the secret word has two T's.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **VOTER** is prioritized to test:
  - Whether **E** is in position 4 (if correct, E gets ✓).
  - Whether **O** is in position 2 (if correct, O gets ✓).
  - Whether **V** is in the word (if absent, V gets x).
- If **VOTER** is incorrect, **OTTER** will be the next guess (testing duplicate T).",Guess 4: VOTER -> FEEDBACK: V(x) O(-) T(✓) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to gather information.
 Some common starting words in word games are: CRANE, RAISE, SLATE, etc.

 Considering that, I choose ""RAISE"" as my first guess because:
  - It contains two vowels (A, I) and three consonants (R, S, E - where E is also very common)
  - It has common letters that appear in many words.

 Let me guess: ""RAISE""

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
  R: - (meaning R is in the secret word but not in the first position)
  A: x (A is not in the secret word)
  I: x (I is not in the secret word)
  S: x (S is not in the secret word)
  E: - (E is in the secret word but not in the last position)

 So, we know:
  - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions we guessed (R was first, E was last).
  - The secret word does not contain A, I, or S.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to form a new guess.

 Important: We must avoid using A, I, and S in the new guess because they are not in the word.

 We know the word has R and E, and we have 5 letters to fill.

 Let's think about possible positions for R and E:
  - R is not in position 1 (since we had R in position 1 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning it's elsewhere).
  - E is not in position 5 (since we had E in position 5 and it was marked as wrong position).

 We also know that the word does not have A, I, S.

 We need to choose a word that:
  - Does not contain A, I, S.
  - Contains R and E (and three other letters that are not A, I, S).
  - Places R not in position 1 and E not in position 5.

 We can also consider common letters to get more information.

 Since we have two known letters (R and E), we can try to use them in different positions.

 Let's try to think of a word that has R and E, and also includes other common letters (like T, N, O, L, etc.) to test.

 Possible positions for R: 2, 3, 4, 5 (but note: if we put R in position 5, that's allowed because we only know it's not in 1).
 Similarly, E can be in positions 1,2,3,4 (but not 5).

 However, we must avoid using A, I, S.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and E and three new letters.

 Example words:
  - ""TRIED"": has T, R, I, E, D -> but I is not allowed (we know I is not in the word). So invalid.
  - ""ROBED"": has R, O, B, E, D -> but O and B are new. Also, R is in position 1? We must avoid R in position 1. So if we put R in position 1, that's not allowed. We need to move R to another position.

 We can try ""BORED"":
  - B, O, R, E, D
  - R is in position 3 (which is not 1) -> okay.
  - E is in position 4 (which is not 5) -> okay.
  - Also, no A, I, S.

 But note: we don't know if O, B, D are in the word. This is a good candidate because it tests new letters.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRWTH"" but that's not common and has no vowels? We need a valid English word.

 Another idea: ""ENTER"" -> but E is in position 1 and 4? But we have two E's? We don't know if the word has two E's. Also, R is at the end (position 5). But we have E in position 1 and 4? Let's see:
  - E in position 1: we don't know if that's allowed (since E can be in 1-4). But we also have E in position 4 and 5? Actually, ""ENTER"" has E at 1, N, T, E at 4, R at 5. 
  - However, we have E at position 1 and 4. But the feedback for the first guess only told us that E is in the word (but not at position 5). It didn't say anything about having two E's. So it's possible.

 But note: we must avoid using A, I, S. ""ENTER"" doesn't have those. However, we have R at position 5. That's allowed because we only know R is not at 1.

 But let me check: the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not at position 1. So it could be at 5.

 However, we also have to consider that we are limited to 5-letter words. ""ENTER"" is valid.

 But we want to maximize information. ""BORED"" and ""ENTER"" are both options.

 Another common word: ""LONER"" -> L, O, N, E, R. 
  - R is at position 5 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). 
  - No A, I, S.

 But note: we have two known letters (R and E) and we are using them. We also test L, O, N.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R and E in positions we haven't tried. In the first guess, R was in position 1 and E in position 5. Now we can try R in positions 2,3,4 and E in 1,2,3,4.

 Let me think of a word that has R in position 2 and E in position 4? For example: ""CRANE"" -> but C, R, A, N, E -> A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So invalid.

 How about ""TREND"": 
  - T, R, E, N, D -> R is in position 2 (not 1) and E in position 3 (not 5). 
  - No A, I, S.

 But note: we have E in position 3. That's allowed.

 However, we already know E is in the word, so we are testing T, R (again but in a new position), E (in a new position), N, D.

 But we are also testing if R is in position 2? We know R is in the word, but we don't know where. So testing R in position 2 is good.

 Similarly, we are testing E in position 3.

 I think ""TREND"" is a good candidate.

 But wait, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn't show any duplicate, but we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROUTE"": 
  - R, O, U, T, E -> R in position 1? That's not allowed because we know R is not in position 1. So we cannot use R in position 1.

 Therefore, we must avoid R in position 1.

 Let me list some words that have R and E, without A, I, S, and without R in position 1:

  - Position 2: R in second position -> e.g., ""TREND"", ""CREST"" (but C,R,E,S,T -> S is not allowed) -> invalid.
  - Position 3: R in third -> ""BORED"", ""CORED"", ""GORED"", ""LURED"", etc. But we must avoid S and A and I.

 ""BORED"": B, O, R, E, D -> R in 3, E in 4 -> good.

 ""LURED"": L, U, R, E, D -> R in 3, E in 4 -> good.

 ""CORED"": C, O, R, E, D -> same.

 But we don't know if the word has O, U, etc.

 Another: ""PERKY"" -> P, E, R, K, Y -> E in 2, R in 3 -> but we have E in position 2? That's allowed. And R in 3. Also, no A, I, S.

 However, we are also testing P, K, Y.

 We want to cover common letters. Common consonants: T, N, L, etc. Vowels: O, U, E (we already have E) and we know A is out.

 Since we have E, we can try to use other vowels: O, U.

 I think ""TREND"" is a good choice because it uses common letters (T, R, E, N, D) and we can get information about T, N, D.

 But note: in ""TREND"", we have:
   T in position 1 -> we don't know if T is in the word.
   R in position 2 -> we know R is in the word, but if it's in position 2 we get feedback.
   E in position 3 -> we know E is in the word, but if it's in position 3 we get feedback.
   N in position 4 -> test N.
   D in position 5 -> test D.

 Also, we avoid A, I, S.

 So I will go with ""TREND"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has two R's? We don't know. But we are using R only once. Similarly for E.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put R and E in the same positions as the first guess? We had R at 1 and E at 5, so now we are putting R at 2 and E at 3? That's different.

 Let me confirm: the first guess had R at 1 and E at 5. Now we are trying R at 2 and E at 3.

 So, I think ""TREND"" is a good second guess.

 However, note that the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 3, that's a new position.

 Let's go with ""TREND"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5.
- A, I, and S are not in the secret word.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Avoid using A, I, or S.
2. Include R and E (since they are confirmed in the word).
3. Place R in a position other than 1 (e.g., positions 2–5).
4. Place E in a position other than 5 (e.g., positions 1–4).
5. Test new common letters (like T, N, D) to gather more information.

A strong candidate is **""TREND""**:
- T (new letter), R (in position 2), E (in position 3), N (new letter), D (new letter).
- It avoids A/I/S and repositions R and E based on feedback.
- This tests high-frequency consonants (T, N, D) while leveraging known letters.

<guess>TREND</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TREND -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A, I, S are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: TREND -> T(-) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)
Meaning:
- T is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 3.
- N and D are not in the word.

Now, combining the information:

Letters NOT in the word: A, I, S, N, D.
Letters IN the word: R, E, T.

Additionally, we know positions where letters cannot be:
- R is not in position 1 (from Guess 1) and not in position 2 (from Guess 2).
- E is not in position 5 (from Guess 1) and not in position 3 (from Guess 2).
- T is not in position 1 (from Guess 2).

The secret word is 5 letters and must contain R, E, T, and two additional letters that we haven't tested or that are confirmed (but we don't know yet).

We have tested the letters: R, A, I, S, E, T, R, E, N, D (from both guesses). So the known absent letters are: A, I, S, N, D.

Therefore, the word must contain R, E, T, and two other letters that are not A, I, S, N, D.

We also have positional constraints:
- R cannot be in position 1 or 2.
- E cannot be in position 3 or 5.
- T cannot be in position 1.

Possible positions for R: 3, 4, or 5.
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, or 4. (since not 3 or 5)
Possible positions for T: 2, 3, 4, 5. (not 1)

Now, we need to form a word that includes R, E, T and two new letters (not A,I,S,N,D), and satisfies the positional constraints.

We need to choose two new letters. Let's consider common consonants and vowels. Since we have no vowels besides E (and E is the only vowel we know for sure), we might need another vowel? But the word might have other vowels such as O, U, Y, etc.

We also want to maximize information, so we should try to use common letters and cover positions we haven't tested.

Let's list the positions:

We have:
- Position 1: Cannot be R (known) or T (from feedback). Also, cannot be A,I,S,N,D. And not E? We don't know; E can be at position 1. So possible: any letter not excluded, including E? But let's see.

We know E can be at position 1. So position 1 can be E or other letters not excluded.

Excluded letters: A, I, S, N, D.

Common letters left: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also have to include R, E, T.

Now, think of words that have R, E, T and two letters from the above, with constraints on positions.

We have feedback that R is not in pos1 or 2, E not in 3 or 5, T not in 1.

So let's try to find a word that meets this.

Example: 
- E could be in position 1: then T must be in 2,3,4,5 but not 1. But if E is at 1, then we have E _ _ _ _
- R must be in 3,4,5.
- T must be in 2,3,4,5.

Possibly ""ETHER"", but we don't know about H and the second E? But we haven't eliminated H. However, ""ETHER"" has two E's? Let's check: 
- E in pos1, T in pos2? But T in pos2: is that allowed? We know T is in the word, but we don't know about pos2. However, we have to test. But also, R is in pos5? R can be at pos5.

But note: we also have to avoid N and D? ""ETHER"" has E, T, H, E, R. So letters: E, T, H, R. H is not excluded.

But wait, does it have two E's? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. The feedback hasn't indicated duplicates yet, but it's possible.

However, in the first guess, E was tested and marked as ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not at pos5. In the second guess, E was at pos3 and marked ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not at pos3. So the E could be the same E? Or a different E? It could be the same E, meaning it must be in a position that is not 3 or 5. So positions 1,2,4.

If there is only one E, then in ""ETHER"", it has E at pos1 and pos4? Then the word has two E's. That's possible.

But we need to verify.

Alternatively, consider other words.

Another option: ""METRO"":
- M, E, T, R, O -> E at pos2, T at pos3, R at pos4.
Check positions:
  - R at pos4: allowed (since not 1 or 2)
  - E at pos2: allowed (since not 3 or 5)
  - T at pos3: allowed (since not 1)

Also, M and O are new letters not excluded.

This seems good.

Similarly, ""METRO"" uses common letters.

Another example: ""TERM "" is 4 letters, no. We need 5 letters.

""OUTER"": 
- O, U, T, E, R -> but E at 4, R at 5? 
But E cannot be at 5? Feedback from guess1 E is not at 5. So if E is at 4? That's allowed? Yes, E can be at 4. Then R at 5: allowed? R can be at 5. T at pos3: allowed? Yes, T can be anywhere except 1.

But we have O and U. U is a vowel? We don't know if U is in the word.

But let me check: position of E? If E is at 4: good. 
Also, we avoid excluded letters.

We could also try ""METRO"" as suggested.

But note: in ""METRO"", we have:
- Position 1: M (not excluded)
- Position 2: E (which we know is in the word and can be at 2? Yes, because not pos3 or 5)
- Position 3: T (allowed? T can be at 3, since not 1)
- Position 4: R (allowed? R not at1 or2, so yes)
- Position 5: O

And we test M and O.

Also, we use all three known letters.

But note: we are testing E at position 2 and T at position 3. If the word has E at position 2, then we might get a check mark? Similarly for T at 3.

But we don't know.

Another word: ""JUMBO"" - no T,R,E.

Must include R,E,T.

Let's list candidates:
- ""METRO"": M, E, T, R, O
- ""RETRO"": but R at pos1? Not allowed. R cannot be at1.
- ""LATER"": but A is excluded -> invalid.
- ""TIGER"": T,I,G,E,R -> I excluded -> invalid.
- ""PETER"": P, E, T, E, R -> has E twice. 
  - Position: E at2 and4? Then we have E at2: allowed? Yes. T at3: allowed. R at5: allowed. But we are using double E? That's possible. However, we have P which is new.

But we don't know if P is allowed.

Same with ""METRO"".

Now, what about ""QUERY"": Q,U,E,R,Y -> but E is at pos3? But E cannot be at pos3 because from guess2 we know E is not at pos3. So invalid.

Similarly, ""QUEUE"" - doesn't have R or T.

Another: ""MERIT"": has I -> invalid.

How about ""BERET"": B, E, R, E, T -> has E twice? And check positions:
- Position1: B? not excluded.
- Position2: E? allowed? Yes, since not 3 or 5.
- Position3: R? but R cannot be at pos3? Wait, no: R can be at pos3? We know R is not at 1 or 2, but pos3 is allowed? Yes, because feedback only said not pos1 and not pos2, so pos3 is possible.
- Position4: E? and position5: T? T can be at5? yes.

But R at pos3? We thought R can be in 3,4,5. So ""BERET"" has R at3: allowed? Yes.

But we have E at2 and E at4? And T at5? 

Also, B is new.

But note: we haven't used any excluded letters.

Alternatively, we can try ""TOWER"": T at1? Not allowed! T cannot be at1. So ""TOWER"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""TROVE"": T at1? invalid.

So, ""METRO"" seems like a strong candidate because:
- It tests E at2 and T at3, which are new positions we haven't tested.
- It tests two new common letters: M and O.
- It satisfies all position constraints.

Moreover, it doesn't conflict with known constraints.

So I'll go with ""METRO"".

But let me double-check: 
- Guess1: RAISE: R was in pos1 (wrong pos), now we are putting R in pos4? We haven't tested pos4 for R. Same for E: we tested E in pos5 and pos3, now in pos2.

And T in pos3? We know T is in the word but not in pos1 (from TREND where T was in pos1). Now we are testing T in pos3.

Yes, this should give us more information.

Therefore, the next guess is ""METRO"".Based on previous feedback:

- **RAISE**: R (wrong position), E (wrong position), A/I/S not in the word.
- **TREND**: T (wrong position), R (wrong position), E (wrong position), N/D not in the word.

### Deductions:
1. **Letters in the secret word**: R, E, T must be present (since all received ""-"" feedback).
2. **Letters NOT in the word**: A, I, S (from RAISE), N, D (from TREND).
3. **Position constraints**:
   - R cannot be in position 1 or 2.
   - E cannot be in position 3 or 5.
   - T cannot be in position 1.
4. The secret word has two unknown letters (from the alphabet excluding A/I/S/N/D), and we need to test new common letters like M, O, L, etc.
5. Possible positions:
   - R: Positions 3, 4, or 5.
   - E: Positions 1, 2, or 4.
   - T: Positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Choose a word that includes R, E, T and two new letters to maximize information, avoiding excluded letters.
- Place R, E, T in positions that haven’t been tested yet and satisfy the constraints (e.g., R not in 1/2, E not in 3/5, T not in 1).
- **""METRO""** is a strong candidate:
  - M (position 1): New consonant.
  - E (position 2): Tests a new position for E (allowed since E ≠ position 3/5).
  - T (position 3): Tests a new position for T (allowed since T ≠ position 1).
  - R (position 4): Tests a new position for R (allowed since R ≠ positions 1/2).
  - O (position 5): New vowel to test.
  - Avoids A/I/S/N/D.

This guess efficiently tests the known letters in new positions while probing two new letters (M and O).

<guess>METRO</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: TREND -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)
Guess 3: METRO -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) T(✓) R(-) O(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: - (in word, not position 1)
- A: x (not in word)
- I: x (not in word)
- S: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, not position 5)

Guess 2: TREND
- T: - (in word, not position 1)
- R: - (in word, not position 2)
- E: - (in word, not position 3)
- N: x (not in word)
- D: x (not in word)

Guess 3: METRO
- M: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, not position 2)  [since it was in position 2 and got ""-""]
- T: ✓ (in word and correct position, so T is in position 3)
- R: - (in word, not position 4)  [since it was in position 4 and got ""-""]
- O: - (in word, not position 5)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. Letters in the word: R, E, T, O (from the feedback, all have been marked as present in some way)
   - R: present, but not in positions 1, 2, or 4 (from guesses 1, 2, and 3)
   - E: present, but not in positions 5 (from guess 1), 3 (from guess 2), or 2 (from guess 3). So E cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5. The only positions left are 1 and 4.
   - T: present and we know it is in position 3 (from guess 3, T is correct at position 3).
   - O: present, but not in position 5 (from guess 3).

2. Letters not in the word: A, I, S, N, D, M (from the x's in all guesses).

3. We have 5 positions. We know T is fixed at position 3.

4. E must be in position 1 or 4 (since it can't be in 2,3,5).

5. R must be in position 3 or 5? But position 3 is taken by T. So R cannot be in position 3. Therefore, R must be in position 5? Because the only positions left for R are 3,4,5 and we know not 1,2,4. So 3 and 5? But 3 is taken by T, so R must be in position 5.

   However, let's list the positions for R:
   - Not in 1 (guess1), not in 2 (guess2), not in 4 (guess3). So possible: 3 or 5.
   But position 3 is occupied by T (fixed). Therefore, R must be in position 5.

6. Now, we have:
   Position 3: T (fixed)
   Position 5: R (since it must be there)

7. E must be in position 1 or 4.

8. We have one more letter to find (since the word has 5 letters, and we have R, E, T, O, and one more). But wait, we have four letters: R, E, T, O. So we need one more letter.

   The word must have five distinct letters? Not necessarily, but so far we haven't seen duplicates. However, we must consider the possibility of duplicates, but let's proceed with distinct for now.

9. The known letters are R, E, T, O, and one unknown. But we also have to place O. O is in the word but not in position 5 (from guess3). So O can be in positions 1,2,3,4? But position 3 is T, so O can be in 1,2,4.

10. Now, let's consider the positions:

    Position 1: Could be E or O or the new letter? But E can be in 1 or 4, and O can be in 1,2,4.

    Position 2: Open for O or the new letter? But E cannot be in 2 (from guess3), so position 2 must be either O or the new letter.

    Position 4: Could be E or O or the new letter? But E can be in 4, and O can be in 4.

    However, we have to assign E to either 1 or 4.

    Also, we have to assign O to one of 1,2,4 (but not 5, and 3 is taken).

    And we have one more letter to place in the remaining position.

11. We also know that the word has O, so we must include it.

    Let me denote the positions:

    Pos1: ?
    Pos2: ?
    Pos3: T
    Pos4: ?
    Pos5: R

    And E must be in pos1 or pos4.

    O must be in pos1, 2, or 4 (but not 5, and 3 is taken).

    Now, if E is in pos1, then:
        Pos1: E
        Then O can be in pos2 or pos4.
        And the remaining position (either 2 or 4) and the other one (if O is in 2, then 4 is open; if O is in 4, then 2 is open) must be the new letter.

    If E is in pos4, then:
        Pos4: E
        Then O can be in pos1 or pos2.
        And the remaining position (1 or 2) must be the new letter.

12. We need to choose a word that fits and tests the possibilities.

    Also, we must avoid the excluded letters: A, I, S, N, D, M.

    Let's think of words that end with R, have T in the middle, and contain E and O.

    Possibilities:

    Option 1: E in pos1, O in pos2 -> then pos4 is the new letter. Word: E O T ? R
        Example: EOTHR? But H is not excluded, but is it a word? ""EOTHR"" is not a word. 
        What about ""EATER""? But A is excluded -> invalid.
        ""ENTER""? N excluded -> invalid.
        ""ELTOR""? L not excluded, but is it a word? ""ELTOR"" is not a word.

    Option 2: E in pos1, O in pos4 -> then pos2 is the new letter. Word: E ? T O R
        This is a common pattern: e.g., ""ECTOR"" (not a word), ""ELTOR"" (no), but ""ECTOR"" isn't valid. 
        What about ""EDITOR""? Too long. We need 5 letters: E _ T O R.
        Examples: ""ECTOR"" not word, ""EKTOR"" not word. 
        Actually, ""ECTOR"" is not a word. But we have ""METRO"" which we already tried? No, we tried METRO and it had M which is excluded.

        Let me think: common words ending in TOR? Like ""VOTER"", but V is not excluded. ""VOTER"": V, O, T, E, R -> but E is in pos4? In ""VOTER"", it's V-O-T-E-R, so E is in pos4? But we are considering E in pos1? This is for the pattern E _ T O R, which is not the same.

        For E _ T O R: the letters are E (1), ? (2), T (3), O (4), R (5). So the word must be of the form E?TOR.

        Examples: ""ECTOR"" no, ""EATOR"" no (and A excluded), ""EDITOR"" is 6 letters. 
        Actually, I can't think of a common word with E?TOR. 

        How about ""EPTOR""? Not a word. 

        So maybe E in pos1 and O in pos4 is not common.

    Option 3: E in pos4, O in pos1 -> then pos2 is the new letter. Word: O ? T E R
        This is the pattern: O _ T E R. 
        Examples: ""OTTER"" -> but T is repeated? ""OTTER"" has two T's. 
        In ""OTTER"": O, T, T, E, R -> but we have T at position 3 and also at position 2? That would be two T's. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in our feedback, we haven't seen a duplicate yet, but it's possible.

        But let's check: in guess3, we had T at position 3 and it was correct. If the word has T at position 2 as well, then in guess2 (TREND) we had T at position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That would be consistent because T is in the word but not at 1 (it's at 2 and 3). But in guess2, we only had one T and it was at position 1, so the feedback doesn't tell us about multiple T's. It could be.

        However, in ""OTTER"", we have T at position 2 and 3. But we already have T at position 3 fixed, so if we put T at position 2, that would be a duplicate. But we are trying to avoid duplicates? We don't have to, but let's see.

        But in this pattern, we are putting O at 1, then a letter at 2, then T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

        So the word is O ? T E R.

        Common words: ""OTTER"" (if the second letter is T) -> but then we have two T's. 
        Other words: ""OATER"" -> but A is excluded. 
        ""OCTER"" not a word. 
        ""OMTER"" not a word. 
        ""ONTER"" not a word and N excluded. 
        ""OTHER"": O, T, H, E, R -> but T is at position 2? In ""OTHER"", it's O-T-H-E-R, so position 2 is T? But we have T at position 3 fixed. So if we put T at position 2, that would be a duplicate T? But the word ""OTHER"" has only one T? No, ""OTHER"" has one T at position 2. But we need T at position 3? So that would be two T's? Not in ""OTHER"". 

        Actually, ""OTHER"" has O in 1, T in 2, H in 3, E in 4, R in 5. But we need T in position 3. So that doesn't match.

        We need a word with O at 1, then a letter (say X) at 2, then T at 3, E at 4, R at 5: O X T E R.

        Examples: ""OTTER"" has O, T, T, E, R -> so positions: O(1), T(2), T(3), E(4), R(5). That works, and it has two T's.

        But is ""OTTER"" a valid word? Yes.

        Now, check against feedback:
        - We have T at position 3 (correct) and also at position 2? But in guess2, we had T at position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That would be consistent because T is in the word (at 2 and 3) but not at 1.

        Also, in guess3, we had T at position 3 and it was correct.

        Now, what about the letters: O is present (we know from guess3) and in this word it's at position 1. In guess3, O was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position (O(-)), so that matches because O is not at 5.

        E is at position 4: we know E cannot be at 2,3,5, so 4 is allowed.

        R at position 5: we know R must be at 5 (as deduced).

        And the word has no excluded letters: A,I,S,N,D,M are out, and ""OTTER"" has O,T,E,R (T repeated) so no excluded.

        But we have two T's? Is that a problem? The feedback doesn't rule out duplicates.

        However, we have to consider if there is a word without duplicate T? Because we haven't confirmed duplicates.

        But let's see the other option.

    Option 4: E in pos4, O in pos2 -> then pos1 is the new letter. Word: ? O T E R
        Pattern: ? O T E R
        Examples: ""COTER"" not common, ""DOTER"" not word, ""HOTER"" not word, ""LOTER"" not word, ""MOTER"" not word (and M excluded), ""POTER"" not word, ""ROTER"" not word, ""TOTER"" -> ""TOTER"" is not a word, but ""TOTER"" might be a misspelling. 
        Actually, ""VOTER"": V O T E R -> but then E is at position 4? In ""VOTER"", it's V-O-T-E-R, so E is at 4? But we have E at 4? And R at 5? And T at 3? Yes. 
        But what about the first letter? V is not excluded.

        So ""VOTER"" is a candidate.

        In ""VOTER"":
          Pos1: V
          Pos2: O
          Pos3: T
          Pos4: E
          Pos5: R

        This satisfies:
          E is in pos4 (allowed: not 2,3,5)
          O is in pos2 (allowed: not 5, and 3 is taken)
          R is in pos5 (allowed: not 1,2,4)
          T is in pos3 (correct)

        And we have V as the new letter.

        Also, no duplicate letters.

        Now, we have two candidates: ""OTTER"" (with duplicate T) and ""VOTER"" (with V).

        But we need to see which one is more likely? Or we can test.

        However, we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 out of 6). We need to choose one.

        But note: in ""OTTER"", we have two T's. In our previous guesses, we have only tested T in position 1 and 3. In position 1 it was wrong, in position 3 it was correct. But if there is a T in position 2, we haven't tested that position for T. So we don't know.

        Similarly, for ""VOTER"", we have V which we haven't tested.

        How can we distinguish?

        Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests the possibilities without committing to one.

        But we have to include the known letters: R, E, T, O. And we know R is at 5, T at 3, and E must be at 1 or 4, and O at 1,2,4 (but not 3,5).

        Since we have two scenarios, we can try to guess a word that covers both possibilities? But it's hard.

        Let's list the constraints again:

        We know:
          Pos3: T
          Pos5: R

        E must be in 1 or 4.

        O must be in 1,2,4.

        And the remaining position (either 1,2, or 4) is the new letter.

        Actually, if E is in 1, then O can be in 2 or 4, and the other is new.
        If E is in 4, then O can be in 1 or 2, and the other is new.

        So the unknown positions are 1,2,4, but with constraints.

        We can try to guess a word that has E in position 4 and O in position 2, for example, and a new letter in position 1? That would be ""VOTER"" as above.

        Or if we put E in position 1 and O in position 2, then we have E O T ? R, and we need a letter for position 4. What letter? We haven't tested many consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

        For example, ""LOTER"" is not a word, but ""HOTER"" not word. ""DOTER"" not word. ""COTER"" not word. ""POTER"" not word. ""MOTER"" not word. ""NOTER"" -> N is excluded. ""ROTER"" not word. ""BOTER"" not word. ""GOTER"" not word. ""YOTER"" not word. 

        Actually, I cannot find a common word for E O T ? R. The only common word I know with that ending is ""VOTER"" but that has V at the beginning and O at 2, not E at 1.

        So perhaps E in position 1 is not possible? Then E must be in position 4.

        And then O must be in position 1 or 2.

        If O is in position 1, then we have O ? T E R, and we need a letter for position 2. The only common word I can think of is ""OTTER"" (with T at 2 and 3) or ""OTHER"" but that has H at 3, not T.

        ""OTHER"" has H at 3, but we need T at 3. So that doesn't work.

        So if O is in position 1, then position 2 must be T? But then we have two T's: ""OTTER"". 

        If O is in position 2, then we have ? O T E R, and the first letter is the new letter. Then ""VOTER"" is a word.

        So the two possibilities are:
          - ""OTTER"" (O, T, T, E, R) with T at 2 and 3.
          - ""VOTER"" (V, O, T, E, R) with V at 1.

        Now, how to choose? We can try to guess one of them.

        But note: in ""OTTER"", we have two T's. In our previous guess (guess2: TREND), we had T at position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That would be consistent with T being at 2 and 3 (so not at 1). Also, in guess3, we had T at 3 and it was correct.

        For ""VOTER"", we have V at 1, which we haven't tested.

        We can try to guess ""VOTER"" to test the V. If it's not, then we can fall back to ""OTTER"".

        But we have two guesses left? We are about to make guess 4, and we have 6 total, so we have two more after this.

        Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the position for E and O without guessing the entire word? But we have to include the known letters.

        However, we know T and R are fixed, so we have to build around them.

        Let me think of a word that has:
          Pos3: T
          Pos5: R
          E in position 4 (since we suspect E is in 4, because E in 1 seems difficult)
          O in position 1? Then we need a letter for position 2. But we don't know what that is. Or O in position 2? Then we need a letter for position 1.

        And we want to test a new letter.

        But if we choose ""VOTER"", we are testing V and also confirming the positions for O, E, T, R.

        Similarly, if we choose ""OTTER"", we are testing the duplicate T.

        But to avoid risking a duplicate if it doesn't exist, maybe ""VOTER"" is safer? And if ""VOTER"" is wrong, then we know it must be ""OTTER"".

        Also, we can check: in guess3, we had O at position 5 and it was marked as present but not at 5. In ""VOTER"", O is at position 2, which is new. In ""OTTER"", O is at position 1, which is also new.

        So both are possible.

        I think ""VOTER"" is a valid word and fits all the constraints, so I'll go with that.

        But let's confirm the feedback we would get if the word is ""VOTER"":

        Guess: VOTER
          V: new letter, if the word is ""VOTER"", then V is correct at position 1 -> ✓
          O: in the word but not at position 5? In ""VOTER"", O is at 2, so if we guess VOTER, then O is at 2, which is not 5, so it would be -? But actually, if it's in the correct position, it should be ✓. 

        The feedback for O: in guess3, O was at position 5 and got ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not at 5. Now, if we put O at position 2 and it is correct, then we should get ✓.

        Similarly, T at 3 is ✓, E at 4: if the word is ""VOTER"", E is at 4 and that is correct? In ""VOTER"", E is at 4? V-O-T-E-R, so E is at 4. And we know E can be at 4. So it would be ✓.

        R at 5: ✓.

        So if the word is ""VOTER"", we would get all ✓ except V? But V is at 1 and if it's correct, then ✓. So all correct.

        But if the word is ""OTTER"", then ""VOTER"" would have V at 1 which is not in the word (since ""OTTER"" has O at 1, not V), so V would be x. Then O at 2: in ""OTTER"", O is at 1, so O is in the word but not at 2? So O would be -. T at 3: ✓. E at 4: ✓ (because ""OTTER"" has E at 4). R at 5: ✓.

        So we can distinguish.

        Therefore, I'll guess ""VOTER"".

        If it's not, then the only other possibility is ""OTTER"".

        But are there other words? For example, with E in position 4 and O in position 1, and a letter in position 2? We have ""OTTER"" (with T in 2) or is there another? Like ""OATER"" but A excluded. ""OCTER"" not word. So probably only ""OTTER"".

        What about E in position 4 and O in position 2, and a different letter in 1? Like ""VOTER"", but also ""DOTER"" not word, ""COTER"" not word, ""HOTER"" not word, ""POTER"" not word, ""YOTER"" not word. ""WOTER"" not word. ""XOTER"" not word. ""ZOTER"" not word. ""BOTER"" not word. ""GOTER"" not word. ""LOTER"" not word. ""NOTER"" not word and N excluded. So only ""VOTER"" is common.

        Therefore, the two candidates are ""VOTER"" and ""OTTER"".

        I'll go with ""VOTER"" as the next guess.

        But note: we have to make sure we don't violate any constraints.

        In ""VOTER"":
          V: not excluded? Yes.
          O: in word and not at 5? We know O is in the word (from guess3) and we are putting it at 2, which is allowed.
          T: at 3, correct.
          E: at 4, which is allowed (E not at 2,3,5 -> 4 is allowed).
          R: at 5, which is required.

        So it's a valid guess.

        Let's make the guess: ""VOTER""

        If it's not correct, then we can guess ""OTTER"" next.

        But we have two more guesses after this? We are on guess 4, so we have 5 and 6 left.

        So I think it's safe.

        Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests the presence of V? But we are already doing that with ""VOTER"".

        So I'll go with ""VOTER"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **RAISE**: R (wrong position), E (wrong position), A/I/S not in word.
- **TREND**: T (wrong position), R (wrong position), E (wrong position), N/D not in word.
- **METRO**: M not in word, E (wrong position), T (correct position), R (wrong position), O (wrong position).

### Deductions:
1. **Confirmed letters in secret word**: 
   - **T** is in position 3 (✓ from METRO).
   - **R**, **E**, and **O** are present but not in tested positions.
   - **Absent letters**: A, I, S, N, D, M.

2. **Position constraints**:
   - **R**: Cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (feedback from RAISE, TREND, METRO). Must be in position 5 (only remaining option).
   - **E**: Cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (feedback from METRO, TREND, RAISE). Must be in position 1 or 4.
   - **O**: Cannot be in position 5 (feedback from METRO). Must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

3. **Word structure**:
   - Position 3: **T** (fixed).
   - Position 5: **R** (deduced).
   - Positions 1, 2, 4: **E** must be in 1 or 4, **O** in 1/2/4, and one unknown letter.

4. **Possible candidates**:
   - **VOTER**: V (new letter), O (position 2), T (position 3), E (position 4), R (position 5).  
     Fits all constraints: E in position 4 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), R in position 5 (required), and tests V.
   - **OTTER**: O (position 1), T (position 2 and 3), E (position 4), R (position 5).  
     Requires duplicate T, but possible if the secret word has two T's.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **VOTER** is prioritized to test:
  - Whether **E** is in position 4 (if correct, E gets ✓).
  - Whether **O** is in position 2 (if correct, O gets ✓).
  - Whether **V** is in the word (if absent, V gets x).
- If **VOTER** is incorrect, **OTTER** will be the next guess (testing duplicate T).

So invalid.\n  - ""ROBED"": has R, O, B, E, D -> but O and B are new. Also, R is in position 1? We must avoid R in position 1. So if we put R in position 1, that\'s not allowed. We need to move R to another position.\n\n We can try ""BORED"":\n  - B, O, R, E, D\n  - R is in position 3 (which is not 1) -> okay.\n  - E is in position 4 (which is not 5) -> okay.\n  - Also, no A, I, S.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if O, B, D are in the word. This is a good candidate because it tests new letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""CRWTH"" but that\'s not common and has no vowels? We need a valid English word.\n\n Another idea: ""ENTER"" -> but E is in position 1 and 4? But we have two E\'s? We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, R is at the end (position 5). But we have E in position 1 and 4? Let\'s see:\n  - E in position 1: we don\'t know if that\'s allowed (since E can be in 1-4). But we also have E in position 4 and 5? Actually, ""ENTER"" has E at 1, N, T, E at 4, R at 5. \n  - However, we have E at position 1 and 4. But the feedback for the first guess only told us that E is in the word (but not at position 5). It didn\'t say anything about having two E\'s. So it\'s possible.\n\n But note: we must avoid using A, I, S. ""ENTER"" doesn\'t have those. However, we have R at position 5. That\'s allowed because we only know R is not at 1.\n\n But let me check: the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not at position 1. So it could be at 5.\n\n However, we also have to consider that we are limited to 5-letter words. ""ENTER"" is valid.\n\n But we want to maximize information. ""BORED"" and ""ENTER"" are both options.\n\n Another common word: ""LONER"" -> L, O, N, E, R. \n  - R is at position 5 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). \n  - No A, I, S.\n\n But note: we have two known letters (R and E) and we are using them. We also test L, O, N.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put R and E in positions we haven\'t tried. In the first guess, R was in position 1 and E in position 5. Now we can try R in positions 2,3,4 and E in 1,2,3,4.\n\n Let me think of a word that has R in position 2 and E in position 4? For example: ""CRANE"" -> but C, R, A, N, E -> A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So invalid.\n\n How about ""TREND"": \n  - T, R, E, N, D -> R is in position 2 (not 1) and E in position 3 (not 5). \n  - No A, I, S.\n\n But note: we have E in position 3. That\'s allowed.\n\n However, we already know E is in the word, so we are testing T, R (again but in a new position), E (in a new position), N, D.\n\n But we are also testing if R is in position 2? We know R is in the word, but we don\'t know where. So testing R in position 2 is good.\n\n Similarly, we are testing E in position 3.\n\n I think ""TREND"" is a good candidate.\n\n But wait, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn\'t show any duplicate, but we don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ROUTE"": \n  - R, O, U, T, E -> R in position 1? That\'s not allowed because we know R is not in position 1. So we cannot use R in position 1.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid R in position 1.\n\n Let me list some words that have R and E, without A, I, S, and without R in position 1:\n\n  - Position 2: R in second position -> e.g., ""TREND"", ""CREST"" (but C,R,E,S,T -> S is not allowed) -> invalid.\n  - Position 3: R in third -> ""BORED"", ""CORED"", ""GORED"", ""LURED"", etc. But we must avoid S and A and I.\n\n ""BORED"": B, O, R, E, D -> R in 3, E in 4 -> good.\n\n ""LURED"": L, U, R, E, D -> R in 3, E in 4 -> good.\n\n ""CORED"": C, O, R, E, D -> same.\n\n But we don\'t know if the word has O, U, etc.\n\n Another: ""PERKY"" -> P, E, R, K, Y -> E in 2, R in 3 -> but we have E in position 2? That\'s allowed. And R in 3. Also, no A, I, S.\n\n However, we are also testing P, K, Y.\n\n We want to cover common letters. Common consonants: T, N, L, etc. Vowels: O, U, E (we already have E) and we know A is out.\n\n Since we have E, we can try to use other vowels: O, U.\n\n I think ""TREND"" is a good choice because it uses common letters (T, R, E, N, D) and we can get information about T, N, D.\n\n But note: in ""TREND"", we have:\n   T in position 1 -> we don\'t know if T is in the word.\n   R in position 2 -> we know R is in the word, but if it\'s in position 2 we get feedback.\n   E in position 3 -> we know E is in the word, but if it\'s in position 3 we get feedback.\n   N in position 4 -> test N.\n   D in position 5 -> test D.\n\n Also, we avoid A, I, S.\n\n So I will go with ""TREND"".\n\n But wait: what if the secret word has two R\'s? We don\'t know. But we are using R only once. Similarly for E.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t put R and E in the same positions as the first guess? We had R at 1 and E at 5, so now we are putting R at 2 and E at 3? That\'s different.\n\n Let me confirm: the first guess had R at 1 and E at 5. Now we are trying R at 2 and E at 3.\n\n So, I think ""TREND"" is a good second guess.\n\n However, note that the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 3, that\'s a new position.\n\n Let\'s go with ""TREND"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R is in the secret word but not in position 1.\n- E is in the secret word but not in position 5.\n- A, I, and S are not in the secret word.\n\nFor the next guess, I need to:\n1. Avoid using A, I, or S.\n2. Include R and E (since they are confirmed in the word).\n3. Place R in a position other than 1 (e.g., positions 2–5).\n4. Place E in a position other than 5 (e.g., positions 1–4).\n5. Test new common letters (like T, N, D) to gather more information.\n\nA strong candidate is **""TREND""**:\n- T (new letter), R (in position 2), E (in position 3), N (new letter), D (new letter).\n- It avoids A/I/S and repositions R and E based on feedback.\n- This tests high-frequency consonants (T, N, D) while leveraging known letters.\n\n<guess>TREND</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: TREND -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE -> R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nMeaning:\n- R is in the word but not in position 1.\n- A, I, S are not in the word.\n- E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: TREND -> T(-) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)\nMeaning:\n- T is in the word but not in position 1.\n- R is in the word but not in position 2.\n- E is in the word but not in position 3.\n- N and D are not in the word.\n\nNow, combining the information:\n\nLetters NOT in the word: A, I, S, N, D.\nLetters IN the word: R, E, T.\n\nAdditionally, we know positions where letters cannot be:\n- R is not in position 1 (from Guess 1) and not in position 2 (from Guess 2).\n- E is not in position 5 (from Guess 1) and not in position 3 (from Guess 2).\n- T is not in position 1 (from Guess 2).\n\nThe secret word is 5 letters and must contain R, E, T, and two additional letters that we haven\'t tested or that are confirmed (but we don\'t know yet).\n\nWe have tested the letters: R, A, I, S, E, T, R, E, N, D (from both guesses). So the known absent letters are: A, I, S, N, D.\n\nTherefore, the word must contain R, E, T, and two other letters that are not A, I, S, N, D.\n\nWe also have positional constraints:\n- R cannot be in position 1 or 2.\n- E cannot be in position 3 or 5.\n- T cannot be in position 1.\n\nPossible positions for R: 3, 4, or 5.\nPossible positions for E: 1, 2, or 4. (since not 3 or 5)\nPossible positions for T: 2, 3, 4, 5. (not 1)\n\nNow, we need to form a word that includes R, E, T and two new letters (not A,I,S,N,D), and satisfies the positional constraints.\n\nWe need to choose two new letters. Let\'s consider common consonants and vowels. Since we have no vowels besides E (and E is the only vowel we know for sure), we might need another vowel? But the word might have other vowels such as O, U, Y, etc.\n\nWe also want to maximize information, so we should try to use common letters and cover positions we haven\'t tested.\n\nLet\'s list the positions:\n\nWe have:\n- Position 1: Cannot be R (known) or T (from feedback). Also, cannot be A,I,S,N,D. And not E? We don\'t know; E can be at position 1. So possible: any letter not excluded, including E? But let\'s see.\n\nWe know E can be at position 1. So position 1 can be E or other letters not excluded.\n\nExcluded letters: A, I, S, N, D.\n\nCommon letters left: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe also have to include R, E, T.\n\nNow, think of words that have R, E, T and two letters from the above, with constraints on positions.\n\nWe have feedback that R is not in pos1 or 2, E not in 3 or 5, T not in 1.\n\nSo let\'s try to find a word that meets this.\n\nExample: \n- E could be in position 1: then T must be in 2,3,4,5 but not 1. But if E is at 1, then we have E _ _ _ _\n- R must be in 3,4,5.\n- T must be in 2,3,4,5.\n\nPossibly ""ETHER"", but we don\'t know about H and the second E? But we haven\'t eliminated H. However, ""ETHER"" has two E\'s? Let\'s check: \n- E in pos1, T in pos2? But T in pos2: is that allowed? We know T is in the word, but we don\'t know about pos2. However, we have to test. But also, R is in pos5? R can be at pos5.\n\nBut note: we also have to avoid N and D? ""ETHER"" has E, T, H, E, R. So letters: E, T, H, R. H is not excluded.\n\nBut wait, does it have two E\'s? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know. The feedback hasn\'t indicated duplicates yet, but it\'s possible.\n\nHowever, in the first guess, E was tested and marked as ""-"" meaning it\'s in the word but not at pos5. In the second guess, E was at pos3 and marked ""-"", meaning it\'s in the word but not at pos3. So the E could be the same E? Or a different E? It could be the same E, meaning it must be in a position that is not 3 or 5. So positions 1,2,4.\n\nIf there is only one E, then in ""ETHER"", it has E at pos1 and pos4? Then the word has two E\'s. That\'s possible.\n\nBut we need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, consider other words.\n\nAnother option: ""METRO"":\n- M, E, T, R, O -> E at pos2, T at pos3, R at pos4.\nCheck positions:\n  - R at pos4: allowed (since not 1 or 2)\n  - E at pos2: allowed (since not 3 or 5)\n  - T at pos3: allowed (since not 1)\n\nAlso, M and O are new letters not excluded.\n\nThis seems good.\n\nSimilarly, ""METRO"" uses common letters.\n\nAnother example: ""TERM "" is 4 letters, no. We need 5 letters.\n\n""OUTER"": \n- O, U, T, E, R -> but E at 4, R at 5? \nBut E cannot be at 5? Feedback from guess1 E is not at 5. So if E is at 4? That\'s allowed? Yes, E can be at 4. Then R at 5: allowed? R can be at 5. T at pos3: allowed? Yes, T can be anywhere except 1.\n\nBut we have O and U. U is a vowel? We don\'t know if U is in the word.\n\nBut let me check: position of E? If E is at 4: good. \nAlso, we avoid excluded letters.\n\nWe could also try ""METRO"" as suggested.\n\nBut note: in ""METRO"", we have:\n- Position 1: M (not excluded)\n- Position 2: E (which we know is in the word and can be at 2? Yes, because not pos3 or 5)\n- Position 3: T (allowed? T can be at 3, since not 1)\n- Position 4: R (allowed? R not at1 or2, so yes)\n- Position 5: O\n\nAnd we test M and O.\n\nAlso, we use all three known letters.\n\nBut note: we are testing E at position 2 and T at position 3. If the word has E at position 2, then we might get a check mark? Similarly for T at 3.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nAnother word: ""JUMBO"" - no T,R,E.\n\nMust include R,E,T.\n\nLet\'s list candidates:\n- ""METRO"": M, E, T, R, O\n- ""RETRO"": but R at pos1? Not allowed. R cannot be at1.\n- ""LATER"": but A is excluded -> invalid.\n- ""TIGER"": T,I,G,E,R -> I excluded -> invalid.\n- ""PETER"": P, E, T, E, R -> has E twice. \n  - Position: E at2 and4? Then we have E at2: allowed? Yes. T at3: allowed. R at5: allowed. But we are using double E? That\'s possible. However, we have P which is new.\n\nBut we don\'t know if P is allowed.\n\nSame with ""METRO"".\n\nNow, what about ""QUERY"": Q,U,E,R,Y -> but E is at pos3? But E cannot be at pos3 because from guess2 we know E is not at pos3. So invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""QUEUE"" - doesn\'t have R or T.\n\nAnother: ""MERIT"": has I -> invalid.\n\nHow about ""BERET"": B, E, R, E, T -> has E twice? And check positions:\n- Position1: B? not excluded.\n- Position2: E? allowed? Yes, since not 3 or 5.\n- Position3: R? but R cannot be at pos3? Wait, no: R can be at pos3? We know R is not at 1 or 2, but pos3 is allowed? Yes, because feedback only said not pos1 and not pos2, so pos3 is possible.\n- Position4: E? and position5: T? T can be at5? yes.\n\nBut R at pos3? We thought R can be in 3,4,5. So ""BERET"" has R at3: allowed? Yes.\n\nBut we have E at2 and E at4? And T at5? \n\nAlso, B is new.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t used any excluded letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""TOWER"": T at1? Not allowed! T cannot be at1. So ""TOWER"" is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""TROVE"": T at1? invalid.\n\nSo, ""METRO"" seems like a strong candidate because:\n- It tests E at2 and T at3, which are new positions we haven\'t tested.\n- It tests two new common letters: M and O.\n- It satisfies all position constraints.\n\nMoreover, it doesn\'t conflict with known constraints.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""METRO"".\n\nBut let me double-check: \n- Guess1: RAISE: R was in pos1 (wrong pos), now we are putting R in pos4? We haven\'t tested pos4 for R. Same for E: we tested E in pos5 and pos3, now in pos2.\n\nAnd T in pos3? We know T is in the word but not in pos1 (from TREND where T was in pos1). Now we are testing T in pos3.\n\nYes, this should give us more information.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""METRO"".Based on previous feedback:\n\n- **RAISE**: R (wrong position), E (wrong position), A/I/S not in the word.\n- **TREND**: T (wrong position), R (wrong position), E (wrong position), N/D not in the word.\n\n### Deductions:\n1. **Letters in the secret word**: R, E, T must be present (since all received ""-"" feedback).\n2. **Letters NOT in the word**: A, I, S (from RAISE), N, D (from TREND).\n3. **Position constraints**:\n   - R cannot be in position 1 or 2.\n   - E cannot be in position 3 or 5.\n   - T cannot be in position 1.\n4. The secret word has two unknown letters (from the alphabet excluding A/I/S/N/D), and we need to test new common letters like M, O, L, etc.\n5. Possible positions:\n   - R: Positions 3, 4, or 5.\n   - E: Positions 1, 2, or 4.\n   - T: Positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Choose a word that includes R, E, T and two new letters to maximize information, avoiding excluded letters.\n- Place R, E, T in positions that haven’t been tested yet and satisfy the constraints (e.g., R not in 1/2, E not in 3/5, T not in 1).\n- **""METRO""** is a strong candidate:\n  - M (position 1): New consonant.\n  - E (position 2): Tests a new position for E (allowed since E ≠ position 3/5).\n  - T (position 3): Tests a new position for T (allowed since T ≠ position 1).\n  - R (position 4): Tests a new position for R (allowed since R ≠ positions 1/2).\n  - O (position 5): New vowel to test.\n  - Avoids A/I/S/N/D.\n\nThis guess efficiently tests the known letters in new positions while probing two new letters (M and O).\n\n<guess>METRO</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: TREND -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)\nGuess 3: METRO -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) T(✓) R(-) O(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE\n- R: - (in word, not position 1)\n- A: x (not in word)\n- I: x (not in word)\n- S: x (not in word)\n- E: - (in word, not position 5)\n\nGuess 2: TREND\n- T: - (in word, not position 1)\n- R: - (in word, not position 2)\n- E: - (in word, not position 3)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- D: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 3: METRO\n- M: x (not in word)\n- E: - (in word, not position 2)  [since it was in position 2 and got ""-""]\n- T: ✓ (in word and correct position, so T is in position 3)\n- R: - (in word, not position 4)  [since it was in position 4 and got ""-""]\n- O: - (in word, not position 5)\n\nNow, let\'s consolidate what we know:\n\n1. Letters in the word: R, E, T, O (from the feedback, all have been marked as present in some way)\n   - R: present, but not in positions 1, 2, or 4 (from guesses 1, 2, and 3)\n   - E: present, but not in positions 5 (from guess 1), 3 (from guess 2), or 2 (from guess 3). So E cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5. The only positions left are 1 and 4.\n   - T: present and we know it is in position 3 (from guess 3, T is correct at position 3).\n   - O: present, but not in position 5 (from guess 3).\n\n2. Letters not in the word: A, I, S, N, D, M (from the x\'s in all guesses).\n\n3. We have 5 positions. We know T is fixed at position 3.\n\n4. E must be in position 1 or 4 (since it can\'t be in 2,3,5).\n\n5. R must be in position 3 or 5? But position 3 is taken by T. So R cannot be in position 3. Therefore, R must be in position 5? Because the only positions left for R are 3,4,5 and we know not 1,2,4. So 3 and 5? But 3 is taken by T, so R must be in position 5.\n\n   However, let\'s list the positions for R:\n   - Not in 1 (guess1), not in 2 (guess2), not in 4 (guess3). So possible: 3 or 5.\n   But position 3 is occupied by T (fixed). Therefore, R must be in position 5.\n\n6. Now, we have:\n   Position 3: T (fixed)\n   Position 5: R (since it must be there)\n\n7. E must be in position 1 or 4.\n\n8. We have one more letter to find (since the word has 5 letters, and we have R, E, T, O, and one more). But wait, we have four letters: R, E, T, O. So we need one more letter.\n\n   The word must have five distinct letters? Not necessarily, but so far we haven\'t seen duplicates. However, we must consider the possibility of duplicates, but let\'s proceed with distinct for now.\n\n9. The known letters are R, E, T, O, and one unknown. But we also have to place O. O is in the word but not in position 5 (from guess3). So O can be in positions 1,2,3,4? But position 3 is T, so O can be in 1,2,4.\n\n10. Now, let\'s consider the positions:\n\n    Position 1: Could be E or O or the new letter? But E can be in 1 or 4, and O can be in 1,2,4.\n\n    Position 2: Open for O or the new letter? But E cannot be in 2 (from guess3), so position 2 must be either O or the new letter.\n\n    Position 4: Could be E or O or the new letter? But E can be in 4, and O can be in 4.\n\n    However, we have to assign E to either 1 or 4.\n\n    Also, we have to assign O to one of 1,2,4 (but not 5, and 3 is taken).\n\n    And we have one more letter to place in the remaining position.\n\n11. We also know that the word has O, so we must include it.\n\n    Let me denote the positions:\n\n    Pos1: ?\n    Pos2: ?\n    Pos3: T\n    Pos4: ?\n    Pos5: R\n\n    And E must be in pos1 or pos4.\n\n    O must be in pos1, 2, or 4 (but not 5, and 3 is taken).\n\n    Now, if E is in pos1, then:\n        Pos1: E\n        Then O can be in pos2 or pos4.\n        And the remaining position (either 2 or 4) and the other one (if O is in 2, then 4 is open; if O is in 4, then 2 is open) must be the new letter.\n\n    If E is in pos4, then:\n        Pos4: E\n        Then O can be in pos1 or pos2.\n        And the remaining position (1 or 2) must be the new letter.\n\n12. We need to choose a word that fits and tests the possibilities.\n\n    Also, we must avoid the excluded letters: A, I, S, N, D, M.\n\n    Let\'s think of words that end with R, have T in the middle, and contain E and O.\n\n    Possibilities:\n\n    Option 1: E in pos1, O in pos2 -> then pos4 is the new letter. Word: E O T ? R\n        Example: EOTHR? But H is not excluded, but is it a word? ""EOTHR"" is not a word. \n        What about ""EATER""? But A is excluded -> invalid.\n        ""ENTER""? N excluded -> invalid.\n        ""ELTOR""? L not excluded, but is it a word? ""ELTOR"" is not a word.\n\n    Option 2: E in pos1, O in pos4 -> then pos2 is the new letter. Word: E ? T O R\n        This is a common pattern: e.g., ""ECTOR"" (not a word), ""ELTOR"" (no), but ""ECTOR"" isn\'t valid. \n        What about ""EDITOR""? Too long. We need 5 letters: E _ T O R.\n        Examples: ""ECTOR"" not word, ""EKTOR"" not word. \n        Actually, ""ECTOR"" is not a word. But we have ""METRO"" which we already tried? No, we tried METRO and it had M which is excluded.\n\n        Let me think: common words ending in TOR? Like ""VOTER"", but V is not excluded. ""VOTER"": V, O, T, E, R -> but E is in pos4? In ""VOTER"", it\'s V-O-T-E-R, so E is in pos4? But we are considering E in pos1? This is for the pattern E _ T O R, which is not the same.\n\n        For E _ T O R: the letters are E (1), ? (2), T (3), O (4), R (5). So the word must be of the form E?TOR.\n\n        Examples: ""ECTOR"" no, ""EATOR"" no (and A excluded), ""EDITOR"" is 6 letters. \n        Actually, I can\'t think of a common word with E?TOR. \n\n        How about ""EPTOR""? Not a word. \n\n        So maybe E in pos1 and O in pos4 is not common.\n\n    Option 3: E in pos4, O in pos1 -> then pos2 is the new letter. Word: O ? T E R\n        This is the pattern: O _ T E R. \n        Examples: ""OTTER"" -> but T is repeated? ""OTTER"" has two T\'s. \n        In ""OTTER"": O, T, T, E, R -> but we have T at position 3 and also at position 2? That would be two T\'s. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, in our feedback, we haven\'t seen a duplicate yet, but it\'s possible.\n\n        But let\'s check: in guess3, we had T at position 3 and it was correct. If the word has T at position 2 as well, then in guess2 (TREND) we had T at position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That would be consistent because T is in the word but not at 1 (it\'s at 2 and 3). But in guess2, we only had one T and it was at position 1, so the feedback doesn\'t tell us about multiple T\'s. It could be.\n\n        However, in ""OTTER"", we have T at position 2 and 3. But we already have T at position 3 fixed, so if we put T at position 2, that would be a duplicate. But we are trying to avoid duplicates? We don\'t have to, but let\'s see.\n\n        But in this pattern, we are putting O at 1, then a letter at 2, then T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n\n        So the word is O ? T E R.\n\n        Common words: ""OTTER"" (if the second letter is T) -> but then we have two T\'s. \n        Other words: ""OATER"" -> but A is excluded. \n        ""OCTER"" not a word. \n        ""OMTER"" not a word. \n        ""ONTER"" not a word and N excluded. \n        ""OTHER"": O, T, H, E, R -> but T is at position 2? In ""OTHER"", it\'s O-T-H-E-R, so position 2 is T? But we have T at position 3 fixed. So if we put T at position 2, that would be a duplicate T? But the word ""OTHER"" has only one T? No, ""OTHER"" has one T at position 2. But we need T at position 3? So that would be two T\'s? Not in ""OTHER"". \n\n        Actually, ""OTHER"" has O in 1, T in 2, H in 3, E in 4, R in 5. But we need T in position 3. So that doesn\'t match.\n\n        We need a word with O at 1, then a letter (say X) at 2, then T at 3, E at 4, R at 5: O X T E R.\n\n        Examples: ""OTTER"" has O, T, T, E, R -> so positions: O(1), T(2), T(3), E(4), R(5). That works, and it has two T\'s.\n\n        But is ""OTTER"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n        Now, check against feedback:\n        - We have T at position 3 (correct) and also at position 2? But in guess2, we had T at position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That would be consistent because T is in the word (at 2 and 3) but not at 1.\n\n        Also, in guess3, we had T at position 3 and it was correct.\n\n        Now, what about the letters: O is present (we know from guess3) and in this word it\'s at position 1. In guess3, O was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position (O(-)), so that matches because O is not at 5.\n\n        E is at position 4: we know E cannot be at 2,3,5, so 4 is allowed.\n\n        R at position 5: we know R must be at 5 (as deduced).\n\n        And the word has no excluded letters: A,I,S,N,D,M are out, and ""OTTER"" has O,T,E,R (T repeated) so no excluded.\n\n        But we have two T\'s? Is that a problem? The feedback doesn\'t rule out duplicates.\n\n        However, we have to consider if there is a word without duplicate T? Because we haven\'t confirmed duplicates.\n\n        But let\'s see the other option.\n\n    Option 4: E in pos4, O in pos2 -> then pos1 is the new letter. Word: ? O T E R\n        Pattern: ? O T E R\n        Examples: ""COTER"" not common, ""DOTER"" not word, ""HOTER"" not word, ""LOTER"" not word, ""MOTER"" not word (and M excluded), ""POTER"" not word, ""ROTER"" not word, ""TOTER"" -> ""TOTER"" is not a word, but ""TOTER"" might be a misspelling. \n        Actually, ""VOTER"": V O T E R -> but then E is at position 4? In ""VOTER"", it\'s V-O-T-E-R, so E is at 4? But we have E at 4? And R at 5? And T at 3? Yes. \n        But what about the first letter? V is not excluded.\n\n        So ""VOTER"" is a candidate.\n\n        In ""VOTER"":\n          Pos1: V\n          Pos2: O\n          Pos3: T\n          Pos4: E\n          Pos5: R\n\n        This satisfies:\n          E is in pos4 (allowed: not 2,3,5)\n          O is in pos2 (allowed: not 5, and 3 is taken)\n          R is in pos5 (allowed: not 1,2,4)\n          T is in pos3 (correct)\n\n        And we have V as the new letter.\n\n        Also, no duplicate letters.\n\n        Now, we have two candidates: ""OTTER"" (with duplicate T) and ""VOTER"" (with V).\n\n        But we need to see which one is more likely? Or we can test.\n\n        However, we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 out of 6). We need to choose one.\n\n        But note: in ""OTTER"", we have two T\'s. In our previous guesses, we have only tested T in position 1 and 3. In position 1 it was wrong, in position 3 it was correct. But if there is a T in position 2, we haven\'t tested that position for T. So we don\'t know.\n\n        Similarly, for ""VOTER"", we have V which we haven\'t tested.\n\n        How can we distinguish?\n\n        Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests the possibilities without committing to one.\n\n        But we have to include the known letters: R, E, T, O. And we know R is at 5, T at 3, and E must be at 1 or 4, and O at 1,2,4 (but not 3,5).\n\n        Since we have two scenarios, we can try to guess a word that covers both possibilities? But it\'s hard.\n\n        Let\'s list the constraints again:\n\n        We know:\n          Pos3: T\n          Pos5: R\n\n        E must be in 1 or 4.\n\n        O must be in 1,2,4.\n\n        And the remaining position (either 1,2, or 4) is the new letter.\n\n        Actually, if E is in 1, then O can be in 2 or 4, and the other is new.\n        If E is in 4, then O can be in 1 or 2, and the other is new.\n\n        So the unknown positions are 1,2,4, but with constraints.\n\n        We can try to guess a word that has E in position 4 and O in position 2, for example, and a new letter in position 1? That would be ""VOTER"" as above.\n\n        Or if we put E in position 1 and O in position 2, then we have E O T ? R, and we need a letter for position 4. What letter? We haven\'t tested many consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n        For example, ""LOTER"" is not a word, but ""HOTER"" not word. ""DOTER"" not word. ""COTER"" not word. ""POTER"" not word. ""MOTER"" not word. ""NOTER"" -> N is excluded. ""ROTER"" not word. ""BOTER"" not word. ""GOTER"" not word. ""YOTER"" not word. \n\n        Actually, I cannot find a common word for E O T ? R. The only common word I know with that ending is ""VOTER"" but that has V at the beginning and O at 2, not E at 1.\n\n        So perhaps E in position 1 is not possible? Then E must be in position 4.\n\n        And then O must be in position 1 or 2.\n\n        If O is in position 1, then we have O ? T E R, and we need a letter for position 2. The only common word I can think of is ""OTTER"" (with T at 2 and 3) or ""OTHER"" but that has H at 3, not T.\n\n        ""OTHER"" has H at 3, but we need T at 3. So that doesn\'t work.\n\n        So if O is in position 1, then position 2 must be T? But then we have two T\'s: ""OTTER"". \n\n        If O is in position 2, then we have ? O T E R, and the first letter is the new letter. Then ""VOTER"" is a word.\n\n        So the two possibilities are:\n          - ""OTTER"" (O, T, T, E, R) with T at 2 and 3.\n          - ""VOTER"" (V, O, T, E, R) with V at 1.\n\n        Now, how to choose? We can try to guess one of them.\n\n        But note: in ""OTTER"", we have two T\'s. In our previous guess (guess2: TREND), we had T at position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That would be consistent with T being at 2 and 3 (so not at 1). Also, in guess3, we had T at 3 and it was correct.\n\n        For ""VOTER"", we have V at 1, which we haven\'t tested.\n\n        We can try to guess ""VOTER"" to test the V. If it\'s not, then we can fall back to ""OTTER"".\n\n        But we have two guesses left? We are about to make guess 4, and we have 6 total, so we have two more after this.\n\n        Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the position for E and O without guessing the entire word? But we have to include the known letters.\n\n        However, we know T and R are fixed, so we have to build around them.\n\n        Let me think of a word that has:\n          Pos3: T\n          Pos5: R\n          E in position 4 (since we suspect E is in 4, because E in 1 seems difficult)\n          O in position 1? Then we need a letter for position 2. But we don\'t know what that is. Or O in position 2? Then we need a letter for position 1.\n\n        And we want to test a new letter.\n\n        But if we choose ""VOTER"", we are testing V and also confirming the positions for O, E, T, R.\n\n        Similarly, if we choose ""OTTER"", we are testing the duplicate T.\n\n        But to avoid risking a duplicate if it doesn\'t exist, maybe ""VOTER"" is safer? And if ""VOTER"" is wrong, then we know it must be ""OTTER"".\n\n        Also, we can check: in guess3, we had O at position 5 and it was marked as present but not at 5. In ""VOTER"", O is at position 2, which is new. In ""OTTER"", O is at position 1, which is also new.\n\n        So both are possible.\n\n        I think ""VOTER"" is a valid word and fits all the constraints, so I\'ll go with that.\n\n        But let\'s confirm the feedback we would get if the word is ""VOTER"":\n\n        Guess: VOTER\n          V: new letter, if the word is ""VOTER"", then V is correct at position 1 -> ✓\n          O: in the word but not at position 5? In ""VOTER"", O is at 2, so if we guess VOTER, then O is at 2, which is not 5, so it would be -? But actually, if it\'s in the correct position, it should be ✓. \n\n        The feedback for O: in guess3, O was at position 5 and got ""-"", meaning it\'s in the word but not at 5. Now, if we put O at position 2 and it is correct, then we should get ✓.\n\n        Similarly, T at 3 is ✓, E at 4: if the word is ""VOTER"", E is at 4 and that is correct? In ""VOTER"", E is at 4? V-O-T-E-R, so E is at 4. And we know E can be at 4. So it would be ✓.\n\n        R at 5: ✓.\n\n        So if the word is ""VOTER"", we would get all ✓ except V? But V is at 1 and if it\'s correct, then ✓. So all correct.\n\n        But if the word is ""OTTER"", then ""VOTER"" would have V at 1 which is not in the word (since ""OTTER"" has O at 1, not V), so V would be x. Then O at 2: in ""OTTER"", O is at 1, so O is in the word but not at 2? So O would be -. T at 3: ✓. E at 4: ✓ (because ""OTTER"" has E at 4). R at 5: ✓.\n\n        So we can distinguish.\n\n        Therefore, I\'ll guess ""VOTER"".\n\n        If it\'s not, then the only other possibility is ""OTTER"".\n\n        But are there other words? For example, with E in position 4 and O in position 1, and a letter in position 2? We have ""OTTER"" (with T in 2) or is there another? Like ""OATER"" but A excluded. ""OCTER"" not word. So probably only ""OTTER"".\n\n        What about E in position 4 and O in position 2, and a different letter in 1? Like ""VOTER"", but also ""DOTER"" not word, ""COTER"" not word, ""HOTER"" not word, ""POTER"" not word, ""YOTER"" not word. ""WOTER"" not word. ""XOTER"" not word. ""ZOTER"" not word. ""BOTER"" not word. ""GOTER"" not word. ""LOTER"" not word. ""NOTER"" not word and N excluded. So only ""VOTER"" is common.\n\n        Therefore, the two candidates are ""VOTER"" and ""OTTER"".\n\n        I\'ll go with ""VOTER"" as the next guess.\n\n        But note: we have to make sure we don\'t violate any constraints.\n\n        In ""VOTER"":\n          V: not excluded? Yes.\n          O: in word and not at 5? We know O is in the word (from guess3) and we are putting it at 2, which is allowed.\n          T: at 3, correct.\n          E: at 4, which is allowed (E not at 2,3,5 -> 4 is allowed).\n          R: at 5, which is required.\n\n        So it\'s a valid guess.\n\n        Let\'s make the guess: ""VOTER""\n\n        If it\'s not correct, then we can guess ""OTTER"" next.\n\n        But we have two more guesses after this? We are on guess 4, so we have 5 and 6 left.\n\n        So I think it\'s safe.\n\n        Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests the presence of V? But we are already doing that with ""VOTER"".\n\n        So I\'ll go with ""VOTER"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **RAISE**: R (wrong position), E (wrong position), A/I/S not in word.\n- **TREND**: T (wrong position), R (wrong position), E (wrong position), N/D not in word.\n- **METRO**: M not in word, E (wrong position), T (correct position), R (wrong position), O (wrong position).\n\n### Deductions:\n1. **Confirmed letters in secret word**: \n   - **T** is in position 3 (✓ from METRO).\n   - **R**, **E**, and **O** are present but not in tested positions.\n   - **Absent letters**: A, I, S, N, D, M.\n\n2. **Position constraints**:\n   - **R**: Cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (feedback from RAISE, TREND, METRO).

We have four guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: RAISE
  R: - (in word, not pos1)
  A: x (not in word)
  I: x (not in word)
  S: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, not pos5)

Guess 2: TREND
  T: - (in word, not pos1)
  R: - (in word, not pos2)
  E: - (in word, not pos3)
  N: x (not in word)
  D: x (not in word)

Guess 3: METRO
  M: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, not pos2)
  T: ✓ (in word and correct position: pos3)
  R: - (in word, not pos4)
  O: - (in word, not pos5)

Guess 4: VOTER
  V: x (not in word)
  O: - (in word, not pos2? because O is in pos2 of the guess, but feedback says ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in that position)
  T: ✓ (pos3, correct)
  E: ✓ (pos4, correct)
  R: ✓ (pos5, correct)

From Guess 4:
- We now know positions 3,4,5: T, E, R are correct and fixed. So the secret word ends with ""TER"" (positions 3,4,5: T, E, R).
- Also, E is fixed at position 4 and R at position 5.

Previous deductions:
- R must be at pos5 (from deduction) -> confirmed by Guess4 (R✓ at5).
- E must be at pos1 or4 -> now fixed at pos4 (from Guess4 E✓ at4).
- T fixed at pos3.

After Guess4, we know the secret word has the form: _ _ T E R

We also have the following information on letters:

Letters in the word (from all feedback):
- R (in word, fixed at pos5)
- E (in word, fixed at pos4)
- T (in word, fixed at pos3)
- O (in word, from Guess3 O(-) and Guess4 O(-)) -> but O is in the word, but not at pos5 (from Guess3) and not at pos2 (from Guess4). So O must be at position 1? Because the only positions left are 1 and 2? But the word is _ _ T E R.

Guess4: we guessed VOTER -> O was in position2, and it was marked as O(-), meaning O is in the word but not at position2.

So for O: 
- It cannot be at pos2 (from Guess4) 
- Cannot be at pos5 (from Guess3)
- And pos3 and pos4 are taken by T and E? So the only possible position is pos1.

Therefore, O must be at position1.

Now, what about the remaining position? Position2: we don't have any information about that letter yet, except that it must be a letter not excluded.

Excluded letters: A, I, S, N, D, M, V (from all the 'x' marks: A,I,S from Guess1; N,D from Guess2; M from Guess3; V from Guess4).

So excluded: A,I,S,N,D,M,V.

We know the word is O _ T E R

We need a letter for position2 that is not excluded and forms a valid English word.

Possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word of the form: O?TER

Common words: 
- ""OTTER"": but that would be O T T E R -> position2 is T, but we already have T at position3. So duplicate T? 
  - But note: in ""OTTER"", we have T at position2 and position3. That is consistent because T is already known to be at position3. 
  - Also, in previous guesses, we haven't tested T at position2. However, we know T is in the word and at position3, but it could be duplicated.

But in Guess2: we guessed TREND (T at pos1, R at pos2, etc.). The feedback for T was ""-"", meaning T is in the word but not at pos1. That doesn't tell us about position2.

Similarly, in Guess4: we have T at pos3 marked correct, but that doesn't say anything about duplicates.

So ""OTTER"" is a possibility.

Another word: ""OATER"" -> but A is excluded, invalid.

""OUTER"": U in position2? O U T E R -> that's a valid word. 
But U is not excluded? No, U hasn't been excluded. But let's check: the excluded letters are A,I,S,N,D,M,V. U is not in the list. So ""OUTER"" would be O U T E R.

But in ""OUTER"", O is at1, U at2, T at3, E at4, R at5.

Is that possible? 
- We know O is in the word and must be at position1? Yes, because O must be at1 (as derived above).
- U is not excluded and we haven't tested it.

But wait, we also have O already at position1. So for ""OUTER"", O at1 is consistent.

But in Guess4, we had O in position2 and it was marked O(-), meaning O is in the word but not at pos2. That doesn't preclude O at position1? Because O being at position1 is separate.

In ""OUTER"", we have O at position1 and there is no other O. So the O is at position1.

The feedback for O in Guess4 was O(-) because we put O in position2 but it is actually at position1? So it's in the word, but not at position2. Correct.

Similarly, in Guess3 (METRO) we had O at position5 and it was O(-), meaning O is not at pos5, which is consistent with O at1.

So ""OUTER"" is also a candidate.

But what about ""OTTER""? That has T at position2? And we already have T at position3? So two T's? That's also possible.

Therefore, we have two candidates:
1. ""OTTER"" -> O T T E R (with two T's)
2. ""OUTER"" -> O U T E R (with U)

Which one to choose?

We can use the fact that we have not tested U yet? Or we can think about the previous feedback.

In particular, in Guess2: TREND -> T at pos1 and it was marked as ""-"", meaning T is in the word but not at pos1. 

If the word is ""OTTER"", then T is at pos2 and pos3. So indeed, T is not at pos1. 

If the word is ""OUTER"", then T is only at pos3. So T not at pos1 is also consistent.

In Guess3: METRO -> T at pos3 was ✓, and R at4 was ""-"". In ""OTTER"", R is at pos5? And not at4? So that's consistent. Similarly for ""OUTER"".

But they both seem consistent.

How to break the tie?

We can consider that in Guess4: VOTER -> we got V(x), O(-), T(✓), E(✓), R(✓). 

If the word has O at position1, then in Guess4, the letter at position2 was V? But V was not in the word (since V(x)), and position1 was V? But in ""OUTER"", position1 is O? Not V.

In Guess4, we guessed VOTER -> V at1, O at2, T at3, E at4, R at5.

The secret word has O at position1 and U at2 for ""OUTER"", or T at2 for ""OTTER"".

So for the secret word ""OTTER"":
  Position1: O (not V) -> V is x (correct)
  Position2: T (but we guessed O) -> O is in the word? Yes, but at position1? So when we guessed O at position2, it was wrong position? So O gets - (which matches the feedback)
  Positions 3,4,5: T, E, R are correct (✓,✓,✓) -> matches.

For ""OUTER"":
  Position1: O (not V) -> V is x (correct)
  Position2: U (we guessed O) -> O is in the word? Yes, at position1? So O is present but not at position2? So O gets - (matches)
  Positions 3,4,5: T,E,R are correct -> matches.

So both ""OTTER"" and ""OUTER"" would give the same feedback for Guess4.

Thus, we need to guess one of them.

We have two more guesses (guess5 and guess6) if needed.

Let me check: are there any other words? Like ""OATER"" -> A excluded. ""OCTER"" not a word. Etc. So only ""OTTER"" and ""OUTER"".

We can try one of them.

But to maximize information, we can choose the one with a new letter? But both have a letter in position2 that we haven't tested: T and U.

But we already know T is in the word (and fixed at pos3)? So if we choose ""OUTER"", we test U? Or if we choose ""OTTER"", we test T at a new position?

But we already know T is in the word, so testing T at position2 might not be new information? Whereas U is completely new.

So ""OUTER"" tests U? Yes.

However, if we guess ""OTTER"" and it's wrong, then we know it must be ""OUTER"". And vice versa.

So we can pick one arbitrarily.

I'll pick ""OUTER"" because it doesn't have a duplicate letter, which might be less likely? (But the game allows duplicates.)

But to be safe, we can guess ""OUTER"".

Then, if it's wrong, we guess ""OTTER"".

Therefore, the next guess is ""OUTER"". 

But let me write the word: O U T E R.

Yes.

But note: position2 is U, which we haven't tested before.

So we'll see.

Therefore, the guess is ""OUTER"".Based on the accumulated feedback:

- **Fixed positions**: 
  - Position 3: **T** (✓ from METRO and VOTER).
  - Position 4: **E** (✓ from VOTER).
  - Position 5: **R** (✓ from VOTER).

- **Present letters**:
  - **O** must be in position 1 (deduced from constraints: O excluded from positions 2, 3, 4, 5; only position 1 remains).
  - Secret word format: **O _ T E R**.

- **Absent letters**: A, I, S, N, D, M, V.

### Deductions:
- The missing letter (position 2) must be a valid English letter not in the absent list (e.g., B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z).
- Possible words: **OTTER** (if duplicate T) or **OUTER** (with U).

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- **OUTER** is chosen to test:
  - Whether the missing letter is **U** (if correct, all letters match).
  - If incorrect (e.g., U gets x), the only remaining option is **OTTER** (with duplicate T).
- Testing **OUTER** prioritizes a non-duplicate scenario first.

<guess>OUTER</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses, I have deduced the following:

1. The secret word has fixed letters in positions 3, 4, and 5: **T**, **E**, **R** (as confirmed by ✓ in Guess 4).
2. **O** is in the word but cannot be in position 2 (feedback from Guess 4) or position 5 (feedback from Guess 3). With positions 3, 4, and 5 fixed, **O** must be in position 1.
3. The only remaining position is position 2, which must be filled by a letter not excluded by previous feedback (excluded letters: A, I, S, N, D, M, V).
4. The secret word format is **O _ T E R**.
5. Two valid English words fit this format:
   - **OTTER** (with duplicate T at position 2).
   - **OUTER** (with U at position 2).

I will test **OUTER** first since it does not require a duplicate letter. If it's incorrect, **OTTER** will be the next guess.

<guess>OUTER</guess>",OUTER,"We have four guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: RAISE
  R: - (in word, not pos1)
  A: x (not in word)
  I: x (not in word)
  S: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, not pos5)

Guess 2: TREND
  T: - (in word, not pos1)
  R: - (in word, not pos2)
  E: - (in word, not pos3)
  N: x (not in word)
  D: x (not in word)

Guess 3: METRO
  M: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, not pos2)
  T: ✓ (in word and correct position: pos3)
  R: - (in word, not pos4)
  O: - (in word, not pos5)

Guess 4: VOTER
  V: x (not in word)
  O: - (in word, not pos2? because O is in pos2 of the guess, but feedback says ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in that position)
  T: ✓ (pos3, correct)
  E: ✓ (pos4, correct)
  R: ✓ (pos5, correct)

From Guess 4:
- We now know positions 3,4,5: T, E, R are correct and fixed. So the secret word ends with ""TER"" (positions 3,4,5: T, E, R).
- Also, E is fixed at position 4 and R at position 5.

Previous deductions:
- R must be at pos5 (from deduction) -> confirmed by Guess4 (R✓ at5).
- E must be at pos1 or4 -> now fixed at pos4 (from Guess4 E✓ at4).
- T fixed at pos3.

After Guess4, we know the secret word has the form: _ _ T E R

We also have the following information on letters:

Letters in the word (from all feedback):
- R (in word, fixed at pos5)
- E (in word, fixed at pos4)
- T (in word, fixed at pos3)
- O (in word, from Guess3 O(-) and Guess4 O(-)) -> but O is in the word, but not at pos5 (from Guess3) and not at pos2 (from Guess4). So O must be at position 1? Because the only positions left are 1 and 2? But the word is _ _ T E R.

Guess4: we guessed VOTER -> O was in position2, and it was marked as O(-), meaning O is in the word but not at position2.

So for O: 
- It cannot be at pos2 (from Guess4) 
- Cannot be at pos5 (from Guess3)
- And pos3 and pos4 are taken by T and E? So the only possible position is pos1.

Therefore, O must be at position1.

Now, what about the remaining position? Position2: we don't have any information about that letter yet, except that it must be a letter not excluded.

Excluded letters: A, I, S, N, D, M, V (from all the 'x' marks: A,I,S from Guess1; N,D from Guess2; M from Guess3; V from Guess4).

So excluded: A,I,S,N,D,M,V.

We know the word is O _ T E R

We need a letter for position2 that is not excluded and forms a valid English word.

Possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word of the form: O?TER

Common words: 
- ""OTTER"": but that would be O T T E R -> position2 is T, but we already have T at position3. So duplicate T? 
  - But note: in ""OTTER"", we have T at position2 and position3. That is consistent because T is already known to be at position3. 
  - Also, in previous guesses, we haven't tested T at position2. However, we know T is in the word and at position3, but it could be duplicated.

But in Guess2: we guessed TREND (T at pos1, R at pos2, etc.). The feedback for T was ""-"", meaning T is in the word but not at pos1. That doesn't tell us about position2.

Similarly, in Guess4: we have T at pos3 marked correct, but that doesn't say anything about duplicates.

So ""OTTER"" is a possibility.

Another word: ""OATER"" -> but A is excluded, invalid.

""OUTER"": U in position2? O U T E R -> that's a valid word. 
But U is not excluded? No, U hasn't been excluded. But let's check: the excluded letters are A,I,S,N,D,M,V. U is not in the list. So ""OUTER"" would be O U T E R.

But in ""OUTER"", O is at1, U at2, T at3, E at4, R at5.

Is that possible? 
- We know O is in the word and must be at position1? Yes, because O must be at1 (as derived above).
- U is not excluded and we haven't tested it.

But wait, we also have O already at position1. So for ""OUTER"", O at1 is consistent.

But in Guess4, we had O in position2 and it was marked O(-), meaning O is in the word but not at pos2. That doesn't preclude O at position1? Because O being at position1 is separate.

In ""OUTER"", we have O at position1 and there is no other O. So the O is at position1.

The feedback for O in Guess4 was O(-) because we put O in position2 but it is actually at position1? So it's in the word, but not at position2. Correct.

Similarly, in Guess3 (METRO) we had O at position5 and it was O(-), meaning O is not at pos5, which is consistent with O at1.

So ""OUTER"" is also a candidate.

But what about ""OTTER""? That has T at position2? And we already have T at position3? So two T's? That's also possible.

Therefore, we have two candidates:
1. ""OTTER"" -> O T T E R (with two T's)
2. ""OUTER"" -> O U T E R (with U)

Which one to choose?

We can use the fact that we have not tested U yet? Or we can think about the previous feedback.

In particular, in Guess2: TREND -> T at pos1 and it was marked as ""-"", meaning T is in the word but not at pos1. 

If the word is ""OTTER"", then T is at pos2 and pos3. So indeed, T is not at pos1. 

If the word is ""OUTER"", then T is only at pos3. So T not at pos1 is also consistent.

In Guess3: METRO -> T at pos3 was ✓, and R at4 was ""-"". In ""OTTER"", R is at pos5? And not at4? So that's consistent. Similarly for ""OUTER"".

But they both seem consistent.

How to break the tie?

We can consider that in Guess4: VOTER -> we got V(x), O(-), T(✓), E(✓), R(✓). 

If the word has O at position1, then in Guess4, the letter at position2 was V? But V was not in the word (since V(x)), and position1 was V? But in ""OUTER"", position1 is O? Not V.

In Guess4, we guessed VOTER -> V at1, O at2, T at3, E at4, R at5.

The secret word has O at position1 and U at2 for ""OUTER"", or T at2 for ""OTTER"".

So for the secret word ""OTTER"":
  Position1: O (not V) -> V is x (correct)
  Position2: T (but we guessed O) -> O is in the word? Yes, but at position1? So when we guessed O at position2, it was wrong position? So O gets - (which matches the feedback)
  Positions 3,4,5: T, E, R are correct (✓,✓,✓) -> matches.

For ""OUTER"":
  Position1: O (not V) -> V is x (correct)
  Position2: U (we guessed O) -> O is in the word? Yes, at position1? So O is present but not at position2? So O gets - (matches)
  Positions 3,4,5: T,E,R are correct -> matches.

So both ""OTTER"" and ""OUTER"" would give the same feedback for Guess4.

Thus, we need to guess one of them.

We have two more guesses (guess5 and guess6) if needed.

Let me check: are there any other words? Like ""OATER"" -> A excluded. ""OCTER"" not a word. Etc. So only ""OTTER"" and ""OUTER"".

We can try one of them.

But to maximize information, we can choose the one with a new letter? But both have a letter in position2 that we haven't tested: T and U.

But we already know T is in the word (and fixed at pos3)? So if we choose ""OUTER"", we test U? Or if we choose ""OTTER"", we test T at a new position?

But we already know T is in the word, so testing T at position2 might not be new information? Whereas U is completely new.

So ""OUTER"" tests U? Yes.

However, if we guess ""OTTER"" and it's wrong, then we know it must be ""OUTER"". And vice versa.

So we can pick one arbitrarily.

I'll pick ""OUTER"" because it doesn't have a duplicate letter, which might be less likely? (But the game allows duplicates.)

But to be safe, we can guess ""OUTER"".

Then, if it's wrong, we guess ""OTTER"".

Therefore, the next guess is ""OUTER"". 

But let me write the word: O U T E R.

Yes.

But note: position2 is U, which we haven't tested before.

So we'll see.

Therefore, the guess is ""OUTER"".Based on the accumulated feedback:

- **Fixed positions**: 
  - Position 3: **T** (✓ from METRO and VOTER).
  - Position 4: **E** (✓ from VOTER).
  - Position 5: **R** (✓ from VOTER).

- **Present letters**:
  - **O** must be in position 1 (deduced from constraints: O excluded from positions 2, 3, 4, 5; only position 1 remains).
  - Secret word format: **O _ T E R**.

- **Absent letters**: A, I, S, N, D, M, V.

### Deductions:
- The missing letter (position 2) must be a valid English letter not in the absent list (e.g., B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z).
- Possible words: **OTTER** (if duplicate T) or **OUTER** (with U).

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- **OUTER** is chosen to test:
  - Whether the missing letter is **U** (if correct, all letters match).
  - If incorrect (e.g., U gets x), the only remaining option is **OTTER** (with duplicate T).
- Testing **OUTER** prioritizes a non-duplicate scenario first.

<guess>OUTER</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses, I have deduced the following:

1. The secret word has fixed letters in positions 3, 4, and 5: **T**, **E**, **R** (as confirmed by ✓ in Guess 4).
2. **O** is in the word but cannot be in position 2 (feedback from Guess 4) or position 5 (feedback from Guess 3). With positions 3, 4, and 5 fixed, **O** must be in position 1.
3. The only remaining position is position 2, which must be filled by a letter not excluded by previous feedback (excluded letters: A, I, S, N, D, M, V).
4. The secret word format is **O _ T E R**.
5. Two valid English words fit this format:
   - **OTTER** (with duplicate T at position 2).
   - **OUTER** (with U at position 2).

I will test **OUTER** first since it does not require a duplicate letter. If it's incorrect, **OTTER** will be the next guess.",Guess 5: OUTER -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) U(x) T(✓) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to gather information.
 Some common starting words in word games are: CRANE, RAISE, SLATE, etc.

 Considering that, I choose ""RAISE"" as my first guess because:
  - It contains two vowels (A, I) and three consonants (R, S, E - where E is also very common)
  - It has common letters that appear in many words.

 Let me guess: ""RAISE""

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
  R: - (meaning R is in the secret word but not in the first position)
  A: x (A is not in the secret word)
  I: x (I is not in the secret word)
  S: x (S is not in the secret word)
  E: - (E is in the secret word but not in the last position)

 So, we know:
  - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions we guessed (R was first, E was last).
  - The secret word does not contain A, I, or S.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to form a new guess.

 Important: We must avoid using A, I, and S in the new guess because they are not in the word.

 We know the word has R and E, and we have 5 letters to fill.

 Let's think about possible positions for R and E:
  - R is not in position 1 (since we had R in position 1 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning it's elsewhere).
  - E is not in position 5 (since we had E in position 5 and it was marked as wrong position).

 We also know that the word does not have A, I, S.

 We need to choose a word that:
  - Does not contain A, I, S.
  - Contains R and E (and three other letters that are not A, I, S).
  - Places R not in position 1 and E not in position 5.

 We can also consider common letters to get more information.

 Since we have two known letters (R and E), we can try to use them in different positions.

 Let's try to think of a word that has R and E, and also includes other common letters (like T, N, O, L, etc.) to test.

 Possible positions for R: 2, 3, 4, 5 (but note: if we put R in position 5, that's allowed because we only know it's not in 1).
 Similarly, E can be in positions 1,2,3,4 (but not 5).

 However, we must avoid using A, I, S.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and E and three new letters.

 Example words:
  - ""TRIED"": has T, R, I, E, D -> but I is not allowed (we know I is not in the word). So invalid.
  - ""ROBED"": has R, O, B, E, D -> but O and B are new. Also, R is in position 1? We must avoid R in position 1. So if we put R in position 1, that's not allowed. We need to move R to another position.

 We can try ""BORED"":
  - B, O, R, E, D
  - R is in position 3 (which is not 1) -> okay.
  - E is in position 4 (which is not 5) -> okay.
  - Also, no A, I, S.

 But note: we don't know if O, B, D are in the word. This is a good candidate because it tests new letters.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRWTH"" but that's not common and has no vowels? We need a valid English word.

 Another idea: ""ENTER"" -> but E is in position 1 and 4? But we have two E's? We don't know if the word has two E's. Also, R is at the end (position 5). But we have E in position 1 and 4? Let's see:
  - E in position 1: we don't know if that's allowed (since E can be in 1-4). But we also have E in position 4 and 5? Actually, ""ENTER"" has E at 1, N, T, E at 4, R at 5. 
  - However, we have E at position 1 and 4. But the feedback for the first guess only told us that E is in the word (but not at position 5). It didn't say anything about having two E's. So it's possible.

 But note: we must avoid using A, I, S. ""ENTER"" doesn't have those. However, we have R at position 5. That's allowed because we only know R is not at 1.

 But let me check: the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not at position 1. So it could be at 5.

 However, we also have to consider that we are limited to 5-letter words. ""ENTER"" is valid.

 But we want to maximize information. ""BORED"" and ""ENTER"" are both options.

 Another common word: ""LONER"" -> L, O, N, E, R. 
  - R is at position 5 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). 
  - No A, I, S.

 But note: we have two known letters (R and E) and we are using them. We also test L, O, N.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R and E in positions we haven't tried. In the first guess, R was in position 1 and E in position 5. Now we can try R in positions 2,3,4 and E in 1,2,3,4.

 Let me think of a word that has R in position 2 and E in position 4? For example: ""CRANE"" -> but C, R, A, N, E -> A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So invalid.

 How about ""TREND"": 
  - T, R, E, N, D -> R is in position 2 (not 1) and E in position 3 (not 5). 
  - No A, I, S.

 But note: we have E in position 3. That's allowed.

 However, we already know E is in the word, so we are testing T, R (again but in a new position), E (in a new position), N, D.

 But we are also testing if R is in position 2? We know R is in the word, but we don't know where. So testing R in position 2 is good.

 Similarly, we are testing E in position 3.

 I think ""TREND"" is a good candidate.

 But wait, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn't show any duplicate, but we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROUTE"": 
  - R, O, U, T, E -> R in position 1? That's not allowed because we know R is not in position 1. So we cannot use R in position 1.

 Therefore, we must avoid R in position 1.

 Let me list some words that have R and E, without A, I, S, and without R in position 1:

  - Position 2: R in second position -> e.g., ""TREND"", ""CREST"" (but C,R,E,S,T -> S is not allowed) -> invalid.
  - Position 3: R in third -> ""BORED"", ""CORED"", ""GORED"", ""LURED"", etc. But we must avoid S and A and I.

 ""BORED"": B, O, R, E, D -> R in 3, E in 4 -> good.

 ""LURED"": L, U, R, E, D -> R in 3, E in 4 -> good.

 ""CORED"": C, O, R, E, D -> same.

 But we don't know if the word has O, U, etc.

 Another: ""PERKY"" -> P, E, R, K, Y -> E in 2, R in 3 -> but we have E in position 2? That's allowed. And R in 3. Also, no A, I, S.

 However, we are also testing P, K, Y.

 We want to cover common letters. Common consonants: T, N, L, etc. Vowels: O, U, E (we already have E) and we know A is out.

 Since we have E, we can try to use other vowels: O, U.

 I think ""TREND"" is a good choice because it uses common letters (T, R, E, N, D) and we can get information about T, N, D.

 But note: in ""TREND"", we have:
   T in position 1 -> we don't know if T is in the word.
   R in position 2 -> we know R is in the word, but if it's in position 2 we get feedback.
   E in position 3 -> we know E is in the word, but if it's in position 3 we get feedback.
   N in position 4 -> test N.
   D in position 5 -> test D.

 Also, we avoid A, I, S.

 So I will go with ""TREND"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has two R's? We don't know. But we are using R only once. Similarly for E.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put R and E in the same positions as the first guess? We had R at 1 and E at 5, so now we are putting R at 2 and E at 3? That's different.

 Let me confirm: the first guess had R at 1 and E at 5. Now we are trying R at 2 and E at 3.

 So, I think ""TREND"" is a good second guess.

 However, note that the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 3, that's a new position.

 Let's go with ""TREND"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5.
- A, I, and S are not in the secret word.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Avoid using A, I, or S.
2. Include R and E (since they are confirmed in the word).
3. Place R in a position other than 1 (e.g., positions 2–5).
4. Place E in a position other than 5 (e.g., positions 1–4).
5. Test new common letters (like T, N, D) to gather more information.

A strong candidate is **""TREND""**:
- T (new letter), R (in position 2), E (in position 3), N (new letter), D (new letter).
- It avoids A/I/S and repositions R and E based on feedback.
- This tests high-frequency consonants (T, N, D) while leveraging known letters.

<guess>TREND</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TREND -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A, I, S are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: TREND -> T(-) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)
Meaning:
- T is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 3.
- N and D are not in the word.

Now, combining the information:

Letters NOT in the word: A, I, S, N, D.
Letters IN the word: R, E, T.

Additionally, we know positions where letters cannot be:
- R is not in position 1 (from Guess 1) and not in position 2 (from Guess 2).
- E is not in position 5 (from Guess 1) and not in position 3 (from Guess 2).
- T is not in position 1 (from Guess 2).

The secret word is 5 letters and must contain R, E, T, and two additional letters that we haven't tested or that are confirmed (but we don't know yet).

We have tested the letters: R, A, I, S, E, T, R, E, N, D (from both guesses). So the known absent letters are: A, I, S, N, D.

Therefore, the word must contain R, E, T, and two other letters that are not A, I, S, N, D.

We also have positional constraints:
- R cannot be in position 1 or 2.
- E cannot be in position 3 or 5.
- T cannot be in position 1.

Possible positions for R: 3, 4, or 5.
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, or 4. (since not 3 or 5)
Possible positions for T: 2, 3, 4, 5. (not 1)

Now, we need to form a word that includes R, E, T and two new letters (not A,I,S,N,D), and satisfies the positional constraints.

We need to choose two new letters. Let's consider common consonants and vowels. Since we have no vowels besides E (and E is the only vowel we know for sure), we might need another vowel? But the word might have other vowels such as O, U, Y, etc.

We also want to maximize information, so we should try to use common letters and cover positions we haven't tested.

Let's list the positions:

We have:
- Position 1: Cannot be R (known) or T (from feedback). Also, cannot be A,I,S,N,D. And not E? We don't know; E can be at position 1. So possible: any letter not excluded, including E? But let's see.

We know E can be at position 1. So position 1 can be E or other letters not excluded.

Excluded letters: A, I, S, N, D.

Common letters left: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also have to include R, E, T.

Now, think of words that have R, E, T and two letters from the above, with constraints on positions.

We have feedback that R is not in pos1 or 2, E not in 3 or 5, T not in 1.

So let's try to find a word that meets this.

Example: 
- E could be in position 1: then T must be in 2,3,4,5 but not 1. But if E is at 1, then we have E _ _ _ _
- R must be in 3,4,5.
- T must be in 2,3,4,5.

Possibly ""ETHER"", but we don't know about H and the second E? But we haven't eliminated H. However, ""ETHER"" has two E's? Let's check: 
- E in pos1, T in pos2? But T in pos2: is that allowed? We know T is in the word, but we don't know about pos2. However, we have to test. But also, R is in pos5? R can be at pos5.

But note: we also have to avoid N and D? ""ETHER"" has E, T, H, E, R. So letters: E, T, H, R. H is not excluded.

But wait, does it have two E's? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. The feedback hasn't indicated duplicates yet, but it's possible.

However, in the first guess, E was tested and marked as ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not at pos5. In the second guess, E was at pos3 and marked ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not at pos3. So the E could be the same E? Or a different E? It could be the same E, meaning it must be in a position that is not 3 or 5. So positions 1,2,4.

If there is only one E, then in ""ETHER"", it has E at pos1 and pos4? Then the word has two E's. That's possible.

But we need to verify.

Alternatively, consider other words.

Another option: ""METRO"":
- M, E, T, R, O -> E at pos2, T at pos3, R at pos4.
Check positions:
  - R at pos4: allowed (since not 1 or 2)
  - E at pos2: allowed (since not 3 or 5)
  - T at pos3: allowed (since not 1)

Also, M and O are new letters not excluded.

This seems good.

Similarly, ""METRO"" uses common letters.

Another example: ""TERM "" is 4 letters, no. We need 5 letters.

""OUTER"": 
- O, U, T, E, R -> but E at 4, R at 5? 
But E cannot be at 5? Feedback from guess1 E is not at 5. So if E is at 4? That's allowed? Yes, E can be at 4. Then R at 5: allowed? R can be at 5. T at pos3: allowed? Yes, T can be anywhere except 1.

But we have O and U. U is a vowel? We don't know if U is in the word.

But let me check: position of E? If E is at 4: good. 
Also, we avoid excluded letters.

We could also try ""METRO"" as suggested.

But note: in ""METRO"", we have:
- Position 1: M (not excluded)
- Position 2: E (which we know is in the word and can be at 2? Yes, because not pos3 or 5)
- Position 3: T (allowed? T can be at 3, since not 1)
- Position 4: R (allowed? R not at1 or2, so yes)
- Position 5: O

And we test M and O.

Also, we use all three known letters.

But note: we are testing E at position 2 and T at position 3. If the word has E at position 2, then we might get a check mark? Similarly for T at 3.

But we don't know.

Another word: ""JUMBO"" - no T,R,E.

Must include R,E,T.

Let's list candidates:
- ""METRO"": M, E, T, R, O
- ""RETRO"": but R at pos1? Not allowed. R cannot be at1.
- ""LATER"": but A is excluded -> invalid.
- ""TIGER"": T,I,G,E,R -> I excluded -> invalid.
- ""PETER"": P, E, T, E, R -> has E twice. 
  - Position: E at2 and4? Then we have E at2: allowed? Yes. T at3: allowed. R at5: allowed. But we are using double E? That's possible. However, we have P which is new.

But we don't know if P is allowed.

Same with ""METRO"".

Now, what about ""QUERY"": Q,U,E,R,Y -> but E is at pos3? But E cannot be at pos3 because from guess2 we know E is not at pos3. So invalid.

Similarly, ""QUEUE"" - doesn't have R or T.

Another: ""MERIT"": has I -> invalid.

How about ""BERET"": B, E, R, E, T -> has E twice? And check positions:
- Position1: B? not excluded.
- Position2: E? allowed? Yes, since not 3 or 5.
- Position3: R? but R cannot be at pos3? Wait, no: R can be at pos3? We know R is not at 1 or 2, but pos3 is allowed? Yes, because feedback only said not pos1 and not pos2, so pos3 is possible.
- Position4: E? and position5: T? T can be at5? yes.

But R at pos3? We thought R can be in 3,4,5. So ""BERET"" has R at3: allowed? Yes.

But we have E at2 and E at4? And T at5? 

Also, B is new.

But note: we haven't used any excluded letters.

Alternatively, we can try ""TOWER"": T at1? Not allowed! T cannot be at1. So ""TOWER"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""TROVE"": T at1? invalid.

So, ""METRO"" seems like a strong candidate because:
- It tests E at2 and T at3, which are new positions we haven't tested.
- It tests two new common letters: M and O.
- It satisfies all position constraints.

Moreover, it doesn't conflict with known constraints.

So I'll go with ""METRO"".

But let me double-check: 
- Guess1: RAISE: R was in pos1 (wrong pos), now we are putting R in pos4? We haven't tested pos4 for R. Same for E: we tested E in pos5 and pos3, now in pos2.

And T in pos3? We know T is in the word but not in pos1 (from TREND where T was in pos1). Now we are testing T in pos3.

Yes, this should give us more information.

Therefore, the next guess is ""METRO"".Based on previous feedback:

- **RAISE**: R (wrong position), E (wrong position), A/I/S not in the word.
- **TREND**: T (wrong position), R (wrong position), E (wrong position), N/D not in the word.

### Deductions:
1. **Letters in the secret word**: R, E, T must be present (since all received ""-"" feedback).
2. **Letters NOT in the word**: A, I, S (from RAISE), N, D (from TREND).
3. **Position constraints**:
   - R cannot be in position 1 or 2.
   - E cannot be in position 3 or 5.
   - T cannot be in position 1.
4. The secret word has two unknown letters (from the alphabet excluding A/I/S/N/D), and we need to test new common letters like M, O, L, etc.
5. Possible positions:
   - R: Positions 3, 4, or 5.
   - E: Positions 1, 2, or 4.
   - T: Positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Choose a word that includes R, E, T and two new letters to maximize information, avoiding excluded letters.
- Place R, E, T in positions that haven’t been tested yet and satisfy the constraints (e.g., R not in 1/2, E not in 3/5, T not in 1).
- **""METRO""** is a strong candidate:
  - M (position 1): New consonant.
  - E (position 2): Tests a new position for E (allowed since E ≠ position 3/5).
  - T (position 3): Tests a new position for T (allowed since T ≠ position 1).
  - R (position 4): Tests a new position for R (allowed since R ≠ positions 1/2).
  - O (position 5): New vowel to test.
  - Avoids A/I/S/N/D.

This guess efficiently tests the known letters in new positions while probing two new letters (M and O).

<guess>METRO</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TREND -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)
Guess 3: METRO -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) T(✓) R(-) O(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: - (in word, not position 1)
- A: x (not in word)
- I: x (not in word)
- S: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, not position 5)

Guess 2: TREND
- T: - (in word, not position 1)
- R: - (in word, not position 2)
- E: - (in word, not position 3)
- N: x (not in word)
- D: x (not in word)

Guess 3: METRO
- M: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, not position 2)  [since it was in position 2 and got ""-""]
- T: ✓ (in word and correct position, so T is in position 3)
- R: - (in word, not position 4)  [since it was in position 4 and got ""-""]
- O: - (in word, not position 5)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. Letters in the word: R, E, T, O (from the feedback, all have been marked as present in some way)
   - R: present, but not in positions 1, 2, or 4 (from guesses 1, 2, and 3)
   - E: present, but not in positions 5 (from guess 1), 3 (from guess 2), or 2 (from guess 3). So E cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5. The only positions left are 1 and 4.
   - T: present and we know it is in position 3 (from guess 3, T is correct at position 3).
   - O: present, but not in position 5 (from guess 3).

2. Letters not in the word: A, I, S, N, D, M (from the x's in all guesses).

3. We have 5 positions. We know T is fixed at position 3.

4. E must be in position 1 or 4 (since it can't be in 2,3,5).

5. R must be in position 3 or 5? But position 3 is taken by T. So R cannot be in position 3. Therefore, R must be in position 5? Because the only positions left for R are 3,4,5 and we know not 1,2,4. So 3 and 5? But 3 is taken by T, so R must be in position 5.

   However, let's list the positions for R:
   - Not in 1 (guess1), not in 2 (guess2), not in 4 (guess3). So possible: 3 or 5.
   But position 3 is occupied by T (fixed). Therefore, R must be in position 5.

6. Now, we have:
   Position 3: T (fixed)
   Position 5: R (since it must be there)

7. E must be in position 1 or 4.

8. We have one more letter to find (since the word has 5 letters, and we have R, E, T, O, and one more). But wait, we have four letters: R, E, T, O. So we need one more letter.

   The word must have five distinct letters? Not necessarily, but so far we haven't seen duplicates. However, we must consider the possibility of duplicates, but let's proceed with distinct for now.

9. The known letters are R, E, T, O, and one unknown. But we also have to place O. O is in the word but not in position 5 (from guess3). So O can be in positions 1,2,3,4? But position 3 is T, so O can be in 1,2,4.

10. Now, let's consider the positions:

    Position 1: Could be E or O or the new letter? But E can be in 1 or 4, and O can be in 1,2,4.

    Position 2: Open for O or the new letter? But E cannot be in 2 (from guess3), so position 2 must be either O or the new letter.

    Position 4: Could be E or O or the new letter? But E can be in 4, and O can be in 4.

    However, we have to assign E to either 1 or 4.

    Also, we have to assign O to one of 1,2,4 (but not 5, and 3 is taken).

    And we have one more letter to place in the remaining position.

11. We also know that the word has O, so we must include it.

    Let me denote the positions:

    Pos1: ?
    Pos2: ?
    Pos3: T
    Pos4: ?
    Pos5: R

    And E must be in pos1 or pos4.

    O must be in pos1, 2, or 4 (but not 5, and 3 is taken).

    Now, if E is in pos1, then:
        Pos1: E
        Then O can be in pos2 or pos4.
        And the remaining position (either 2 or 4) and the other one (if O is in 2, then 4 is open; if O is in 4, then 2 is open) must be the new letter.

    If E is in pos4, then:
        Pos4: E
        Then O can be in pos1 or pos2.
        And the remaining position (1 or 2) must be the new letter.

12. We need to choose a word that fits and tests the possibilities.

    Also, we must avoid the excluded letters: A, I, S, N, D, M.

    Let's think of words that end with R, have T in the middle, and contain E and O.

    Possibilities:

    Option 1: E in pos1, O in pos2 -> then pos4 is the new letter. Word: E O T ? R
        Example: EOTHR? But H is not excluded, but is it a word? ""EOTHR"" is not a word. 
        What about ""EATER""? But A is excluded -> invalid.
        ""ENTER""? N excluded -> invalid.
        ""ELTOR""? L not excluded, but is it a word? ""ELTOR"" is not a word.

    Option 2: E in pos1, O in pos4 -> then pos2 is the new letter. Word: E ? T O R
        This is a common pattern: e.g., ""ECTOR"" (not a word), ""ELTOR"" (no), but ""ECTOR"" isn't valid. 
        What about ""EDITOR""? Too long. We need 5 letters: E _ T O R.
        Examples: ""ECTOR"" not word, ""EKTOR"" not word. 
        Actually, ""ECTOR"" is not a word. But we have ""METRO"" which we already tried? No, we tried METRO and it had M which is excluded.

        Let me think: common words ending in TOR? Like ""VOTER"", but V is not excluded. ""VOTER"": V, O, T, E, R -> but E is in pos4? In ""VOTER"", it's V-O-T-E-R, so E is in pos4? But we are considering E in pos1? This is for the pattern E _ T O R, which is not the same.

        For E _ T O R: the letters are E (1), ? (2), T (3), O (4), R (5). So the word must be of the form E?TOR.

        Examples: ""ECTOR"" no, ""EATOR"" no (and A excluded), ""EDITOR"" is 6 letters. 
        Actually, I can't think of a common word with E?TOR. 

        How about ""EPTOR""? Not a word. 

        So maybe E in pos1 and O in pos4 is not common.

    Option 3: E in pos4, O in pos1 -> then pos2 is the new letter. Word: O ? T E R
        This is the pattern: O _ T E R. 
        Examples: ""OTTER"" -> but T is repeated? ""OTTER"" has two T's. 
        In ""OTTER"": O, T, T, E, R -> but we have T at position 3 and also at position 2? That would be two T's. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in our feedback, we haven't seen a duplicate yet, but it's possible.

        But let's check: in guess3, we had T at position 3 and it was correct. If the word has T at position 2 as well, then in guess2 (TREND) we had T at position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That would be consistent because T is in the word but not at 1 (it's at 2 and 3). But in guess2, we only had one T and it was at position 1, so the feedback doesn't tell us about multiple T's. It could be.

        However, in ""OTTER"", we have T at position 2 and 3. But we already have T at position 3 fixed, so if we put T at position 2, that would be a duplicate. But we are trying to avoid duplicates? We don't have to, but let's see.

        But in this pattern, we are putting O at 1, then a letter at 2, then T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

        So the word is O ? T E R.

        Common words: ""OTTER"" (if the second letter is T) -> but then we have two T's. 
        Other words: ""OATER"" -> but A is excluded. 
        ""OCTER"" not a word. 
        ""OMTER"" not a word. 
        ""ONTER"" not a word and N excluded. 
        ""OTHER"": O, T, H, E, R -> but T is at position 2? In ""OTHER"", it's O-T-H-E-R, so position 2 is T? But we have T at position 3 fixed. So if we put T at position 2, that would be a duplicate T? But the word ""OTHER"" has only one T? No, ""OTHER"" has one T at position 2. But we need T at position 3? So that would be two T's? Not in ""OTHER"". 

        Actually, ""OTHER"" has O in 1, T in 2, H in 3, E in 4, R in 5. But we need T in position 3. So that doesn't match.

        We need a word with O at 1, then a letter (say X) at 2, then T at 3, E at 4, R at 5: O X T E R.

        Examples: ""OTTER"" has O, T, T, E, R -> so positions: O(1), T(2), T(3), E(4), R(5). That works, and it has two T's.

        But is ""OTTER"" a valid word? Yes.

        Now, check against feedback:
        - We have T at position 3 (correct) and also at position 2? But in guess2, we had T at position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That would be consistent because T is in the word (at 2 and 3) but not at 1.

        Also, in guess3, we had T at position 3 and it was correct.

        Now, what about the letters: O is present (we know from guess3) and in this word it's at position 1. In guess3, O was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position (O(-)), so that matches because O is not at 5.

        E is at position 4: we know E cannot be at 2,3,5, so 4 is allowed.

        R at position 5: we know R must be at 5 (as deduced).

        And the word has no excluded letters: A,I,S,N,D,M are out, and ""OTTER"" has O,T,E,R (T repeated) so no excluded.

        But we have two T's? Is that a problem? The feedback doesn't rule out duplicates.

        However, we have to consider if there is a word without duplicate T? Because we haven't confirmed duplicates.

        But let's see the other option.

    Option 4: E in pos4, O in pos2 -> then pos1 is the new letter. Word: ? O T E R
        Pattern: ? O T E R
        Examples: ""COTER"" not common, ""DOTER"" not word, ""HOTER"" not word, ""LOTER"" not word, ""MOTER"" not word (and M excluded), ""POTER"" not word, ""ROTER"" not word, ""TOTER"" -> ""TOTER"" is not a word, but ""TOTER"" might be a misspelling. 
        Actually, ""VOTER"": V O T E R -> but then E is at position 4? In ""VOTER"", it's V-O-T-E-R, so E is at 4? But we have E at 4? And R at 5? And T at 3? Yes. 
        But what about the first letter? V is not excluded.

        So ""VOTER"" is a candidate.

        In ""VOTER"":
          Pos1: V
          Pos2: O
          Pos3: T
          Pos4: E
          Pos5: R

        This satisfies:
          E is in pos4 (allowed: not 2,3,5)
          O is in pos2 (allowed: not 5, and 3 is taken)
          R is in pos5 (allowed: not 1,2,4)
          T is in pos3 (correct)

        And we have V as the new letter.

        Also, no duplicate letters.

        Now, we have two candidates: ""OTTER"" (with duplicate T) and ""VOTER"" (with V).

        But we need to see which one is more likely? Or we can test.

        However, we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 out of 6). We need to choose one.

        But note: in ""OTTER"", we have two T's. In our previous guesses, we have only tested T in position 1 and 3. In position 1 it was wrong, in position 3 it was correct. But if there is a T in position 2, we haven't tested that position for T. So we don't know.

        Similarly, for ""VOTER"", we have V which we haven't tested.

        How can we distinguish?

        Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests the possibilities without committing to one.

        But we have to include the known letters: R, E, T, O. And we know R is at 5, T at 3, and E must be at 1 or 4, and O at 1,2,4 (but not 3,5).

        Since we have two scenarios, we can try to guess a word that covers both possibilities? But it's hard.

        Let's list the constraints again:

        We know:
          Pos3: T
          Pos5: R

        E must be in 1 or 4.

        O must be in 1,2,4.

        And the remaining position (either 1,2, or 4) is the new letter.

        Actually, if E is in 1, then O can be in 2 or 4, and the other is new.
        If E is in 4, then O can be in 1 or 2, and the other is new.

        So the unknown positions are 1,2,4, but with constraints.

        We can try to guess a word that has E in position 4 and O in position 2, for example, and a new letter in position 1? That would be ""VOTER"" as above.

        Or if we put E in position 1 and O in position 2, then we have E O T ? R, and we need a letter for position 4. What letter? We haven't tested many consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

        For example, ""LOTER"" is not a word, but ""HOTER"" not word. ""DOTER"" not word. ""COTER"" not word. ""POTER"" not word. ""MOTER"" not word. ""NOTER"" -> N is excluded. ""ROTER"" not word. ""BOTER"" not word. ""GOTER"" not word. ""YOTER"" not word. 

        Actually, I cannot find a common word for E O T ? R. The only common word I know with that ending is ""VOTER"" but that has V at the beginning and O at 2, not E at 1.

        So perhaps E in position 1 is not possible? Then E must be in position 4.

        And then O must be in position 1 or 2.

        If O is in position 1, then we have O ? T E R, and we need a letter for position 2. The only common word I can think of is ""OTTER"" (with T at 2 and 3) or ""OTHER"" but that has H at 3, not T.

        ""OTHER"" has H at 3, but we need T at 3. So that doesn't work.

        So if O is in position 1, then position 2 must be T? But then we have two T's: ""OTTER"". 

        If O is in position 2, then we have ? O T E R, and the first letter is the new letter. Then ""VOTER"" is a word.

        So the two possibilities are:
          - ""OTTER"" (O, T, T, E, R) with T at 2 and 3.
          - ""VOTER"" (V, O, T, E, R) with V at 1.

        Now, how to choose? We can try to guess one of them.

        But note: in ""OTTER"", we have two T's. In our previous guess (guess2: TREND), we had T at position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That would be consistent with T being at 2 and 3 (so not at 1). Also, in guess3, we had T at 3 and it was correct.

        For ""VOTER"", we have V at 1, which we haven't tested.

        We can try to guess ""VOTER"" to test the V. If it's not, then we can fall back to ""OTTER"".

        But we have two guesses left? We are about to make guess 4, and we have 6 total, so we have two more after this.

        Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the position for E and O without guessing the entire word? But we have to include the known letters.

        However, we know T and R are fixed, so we have to build around them.

        Let me think of a word that has:
          Pos3: T
          Pos5: R
          E in position 4 (since we suspect E is in 4, because E in 1 seems difficult)
          O in position 1? Then we need a letter for position 2. But we don't know what that is. Or O in position 2? Then we need a letter for position 1.

        And we want to test a new letter.

        But if we choose ""VOTER"", we are testing V and also confirming the positions for O, E, T, R.

        Similarly, if we choose ""OTTER"", we are testing the duplicate T.

        But to avoid risking a duplicate if it doesn't exist, maybe ""VOTER"" is safer? And if ""VOTER"" is wrong, then we know it must be ""OTTER"".

        Also, we can check: in guess3, we had O at position 5 and it was marked as present but not at 5. In ""VOTER"", O is at position 2, which is new. In ""OTTER"", O is at position 1, which is also new.

        So both are possible.

        I think ""VOTER"" is a valid word and fits all the constraints, so I'll go with that.

        But let's confirm the feedback we would get if the word is ""VOTER"":

        Guess: VOTER
          V: new letter, if the word is ""VOTER"", then V is correct at position 1 -> ✓
          O: in the word but not at position 5? In ""VOTER"", O is at 2, so if we guess VOTER, then O is at 2, which is not 5, so it would be -? But actually, if it's in the correct position, it should be ✓. 

        The feedback for O: in guess3, O was at position 5 and got ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not at 5. Now, if we put O at position 2 and it is correct, then we should get ✓.

        Similarly, T at 3 is ✓, E at 4: if the word is ""VOTER"", E is at 4 and that is correct? In ""VOTER"", E is at 4? V-O-T-E-R, so E is at 4. And we know E can be at 4. So it would be ✓.

        R at 5: ✓.

        So if the word is ""VOTER"", we would get all ✓ except V? But V is at 1 and if it's correct, then ✓. So all correct.

        But if the word is ""OTTER"", then ""VOTER"" would have V at 1 which is not in the word (since ""OTTER"" has O at 1, not V), so V would be x. Then O at 2: in ""OTTER"", O is at 1, so O is in the word but not at 2? So O would be -. T at 3: ✓. E at 4: ✓ (because ""OTTER"" has E at 4). R at 5: ✓.

        So we can distinguish.

        Therefore, I'll guess ""VOTER"".

        If it's not, then the only other possibility is ""OTTER"".

        But are there other words? For example, with E in position 4 and O in position 1, and a letter in position 2? We have ""OTTER"" (with T in 2) or is there another? Like ""OATER"" but A excluded. ""OCTER"" not word. So probably only ""OTTER"".

        What about E in position 4 and O in position 2, and a different letter in 1? Like ""VOTER"", but also ""DOTER"" not word, ""COTER"" not word, ""HOTER"" not word, ""POTER"" not word, ""YOTER"" not word. ""WOTER"" not word. ""XOTER"" not word. ""ZOTER"" not word. ""BOTER"" not word. ""GOTER"" not word. ""LOTER"" not word. ""NOTER"" not word and N excluded. So only ""VOTER"" is common.

        Therefore, the two candidates are ""VOTER"" and ""OTTER"".

        I'll go with ""VOTER"" as the next guess.

        But note: we have to make sure we don't violate any constraints.

        In ""VOTER"":
          V: not excluded? Yes.
          O: in word and not at 5? We know O is in the word (from guess3) and we are putting it at 2, which is allowed.
          T: at 3, correct.
          E: at 4, which is allowed (E not at 2,3,5 -> 4 is allowed).
          R: at 5, which is required.

        So it's a valid guess.

        Let's make the guess: ""VOTER""

        If it's not correct, then we can guess ""OTTER"" next.

        But we have two more guesses after this? We are on guess 4, so we have 5 and 6 left.

        So I think it's safe.

        Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests the presence of V? But we are already doing that with ""VOTER"".

        So I'll go with ""VOTER"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **RAISE**: R (wrong position), E (wrong position), A/I/S not in word.
- **TREND**: T (wrong position), R (wrong position), E (wrong position), N/D not in word.
- **METRO**: M not in word, E (wrong position), T (correct position), R (wrong position), O (wrong position).

### Deductions:
1. **Confirmed letters in secret word**: 
   - **T** is in position 3 (✓ from METRO).
   - **R**, **E**, and **O** are present but not in tested positions.
   - **Absent letters**: A, I, S, N, D, M.

2. **Position constraints**:
   - **R**: Cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (feedback from RAISE, TREND, METRO). Must be in position 5 (only remaining option).
   - **E**: Cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (feedback from METRO, TREND, RAISE). Must be in position 1 or 4.
   - **O**: Cannot be in position 5 (feedback from METRO). Must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

3. **Word structure**:
   - Position 3: **T** (fixed).
   - Position 5: **R** (deduced).
   - Positions 1, 2, 4: **E** must be in 1 or 4, **O** in 1/2/4, and one unknown letter.

4. **Possible candidates**:
   - **VOTER**: V (new letter), O (position 2), T (position 3), E (position 4), R (position 5).  
     Fits all constraints: E in position 4 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), R in position 5 (required), and tests V.
   - **OTTER**: O (position 1), T (position 2 and 3), E (position 4), R (position 5).  
     Requires duplicate T, but possible if the secret word has two T's.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **VOTER** is prioritized to test:
  - Whether **E** is in position 4 (if correct, E gets ✓).
  - Whether **O** is in position 2 (if correct, O gets ✓).
  - Whether **V** is in the word (if absent, V gets x).
- If **VOTER** is incorrect, **OTTER** will be the next guess (testing duplicate T).

<｜Assistant｜>We have four guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: RAISE
  R: - (in word, not pos1)
  A: x (not in word)
  I: x (not in word)
  S: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, not pos5)

Guess 2: TREND
  T: - (in word, not pos1)
  R: - (in word, not pos2)
  E: - (in word, not pos3)
  N: x (not in word)
  D: x (not in word)

Guess 3: METRO
  M: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, not pos2)
  T: ✓ (in word and correct position: pos3)
  R: - (in word, not pos4)
  O: - (in word, not pos5)

Guess 4: VOTER
  V: x (not in word)
  O: - (in word, not pos2? because O is in pos2 of the guess, but feedback says ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in that position)
  T: ✓ (pos3, correct)
  E: ✓ (pos4, correct)
  R: ✓ (pos5, correct)

From Guess 4:
- We now know positions 3,4,5: T, E, R are correct and fixed. So the secret word ends with ""TER"" (positions 3,4,5: T, E, R).
- Also, E is fixed at position 4 and R at position 5.

Previous deductions:
- R must be at pos5 (from deduction) -> confirmed by Guess4 (R✓ at5).
- E must be at pos1 or4 -> now fixed at pos4 (from Guess4 E✓ at4).
- T fixed at pos3.

After Guess4, we know the secret word has the form: _ _ T E R

We also have the following information on letters:

Letters in the word (from all feedback):
- R (in word, fixed at pos5)
- E (in word, fixed at pos4)
- T (in word, fixed at pos3)
- O (in word, from Guess3 O(-) and Guess4 O(-)) -> but O is in the word, but not at pos5 (from Guess3) and not at pos2 (from Guess4). So O must be at position 1? Because the only positions left are 1 and 2? But the word is _ _ T E R.

Guess4: we guessed VOTER -> O was in position2, and it was marked as O(-), meaning O is in the word but not at position2.

So for O: 
- It cannot be at pos2 (from Guess4) 
- Cannot be at pos5 (from Guess3)
- And pos3 and pos4 are taken by T and E? So the only possible position is pos1.

Therefore, O must be at position1.

Now, what about the remaining position? Position2: we don't have any information about that letter yet, except that it must be a letter not excluded.

Excluded letters: A, I, S, N, D, M, V (from all the 'x' marks: A,I,S from Guess1; N,D from Guess2; M from Guess3; V from Guess4).

So excluded: A,I,S,N,D,M,V.

We know the word is O _ T E R

We need a letter for position2 that is not excluded and forms a valid English word.

Possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word of the form: O?TER

Common words: 
- ""OTTER"": but that would be O T T E R -> position2 is T, but we already have T at position3. So duplicate T? 
  - But note: in ""OTTER"", we have T at position2 and position3. That is consistent because T is already known to be at position3. 
  - Also, in previous guesses, we haven't tested T at position2. However, we know T is in the word and at position3, but it could be duplicated.

But in Guess2: we guessed TREND (T at pos1, R at pos2, etc.). The feedback for T was ""-"", meaning T is in the word but not at pos1. That doesn't tell us about position2.

Similarly, in Guess4: we have T at pos3 marked correct, but that doesn't say anything about duplicates.

So ""OTTER"" is a possibility.

Another word: ""OATER"" -> but A is excluded, invalid.

""OUTER"": U in position2? O U T E R -> that's a valid word. 
But U is not excluded? No, U hasn't been excluded. But let's check: the excluded letters are A,I,S,N,D,M,V. U is not in the list. So ""OUTER"" would be O U T E R.

But in ""OUTER"", O is at1, U at2, T at3, E at4, R at5.

Is that possible? 
- We know O is in the word and must be at position1? Yes, because O must be at1 (as derived above).
- U is not excluded and we haven't tested it.

But wait, we also have O already at position1. So for ""OUTER"", O at1 is consistent.

But in Guess4, we had O in position2 and it was marked O(-), meaning O is in the word but not at pos2. That doesn't preclude O at position1? Because O being at position1 is separate.

In ""OUTER"", we have O at position1 and there is no other O. So the O is at position1.

The feedback for O in Guess4 was O(-) because we put O in position2 but it is actually at position1? So it's in the word, but not at position2. Correct.

Similarly, in Guess3 (METRO) we had O at position5 and it was O(-), meaning O is not at pos5, which is consistent with O at1.

So ""OUTER"" is also a candidate.

But what about ""OTTER""? That has T at position2? And we already have T at position3? So two T's? That's also possible.

Therefore, we have two candidates:
1. ""OTTER"" -> O T T E R (with two T's)
2. ""OUTER"" -> O U T E R (with U)

Which one to choose?

We can use the fact that we have not tested U yet? Or we can think about the previous feedback.

In particular, in Guess2: TREND -> T at pos1 and it was marked as ""-"", meaning T is in the word but not at pos1. 

If the word is ""OTTER"", then T is at pos2 and pos3. So indeed, T is not at pos1. 

If the word is ""OUTER"", then T is only at pos3. So T not at pos1 is also consistent.

In Guess3: METRO -> T at pos3 was ✓, and R at4 was ""-"". In ""OTTER"", R is at pos5? And not at4? So that's consistent. Similarly for ""OUTER"".

But they both seem consistent.

How to break the tie?

We can consider that in Guess4: VOTER -> we got V(x), O(-), T(✓), E(✓), R(✓). 

If the word has O at position1, then in Guess4, the letter at position2 was V? But V was not in the word (since V(x)), and position1 was V? But in ""OUTER"", position1 is O? Not V.

In Guess4, we guessed VOTER -> V at1, O at2, T at3, E at4, R at5.

The secret word has O at position1 and U at2 for ""OUTER"", or T at2 for ""OTTER"".

So for the secret word ""OTTER"":
  Position1: O (not V) -> V is x (correct)
  Position2: T (but we guessed O) -> O is in the word? Yes, but at position1? So when we guessed O at position2, it was wrong position? So O gets - (which matches the feedback)
  Positions 3,4,5: T, E, R are correct (✓,✓,✓) -> matches.

For ""OUTER"":
  Position1: O (not V) -> V is x (correct)
  Position2: U (we guessed O) -> O is in the word? Yes, at position1? So O is present but not at position2? So O gets - (matches)
  Positions 3,4,5: T,E,R are correct -> matches.

So both ""OTTER"" and ""OUTER"" would give the same feedback for Guess4.

Thus, we need to guess one of them.

We have two more guesses (guess5 and guess6) if needed.

Let me check: are there any other words? Like ""OATER"" -> A excluded. ""OCTER"" not a word. Etc. So only ""OTTER"" and ""OUTER"".

We can try one of them.

But to maximize information, we can choose the one with a new letter? But both have a letter in position2 that we haven't tested: T and U.

But we already know T is in the word (and fixed at pos3)? So if we choose ""OUTER"", we test U? Or if we choose ""OTTER"", we test T at a new position?

But we already know T is in the word, so testing T at position2 might not be new information? Whereas U is completely new.

So ""OUTER"" tests U? Yes.

However, if we guess ""OTTER"" and it's wrong, then we know it must be ""OUTER"". And vice versa.

So we can pick one arbitrarily.

I'll pick ""OUTER"" because it doesn't have a duplicate letter, which might be less likely? (But the game allows duplicates.)

But to be safe, we can guess ""OUTER"".

Then, if it's wrong, we guess ""OTTER"".

Therefore, the next guess is ""OUTER"". 

But let me write the word: O U T E R.

Yes.

But note: position2 is U, which we haven't tested before.

So we'll see.

Therefore, the guess is ""OUTER"".Based on the accumulated feedback:

- **Fixed positions**: 
  - Position 3: **T** (✓ from METRO and VOTER).
  - Position 4: **E** (✓ from VOTER).
  - Position 5: **R** (✓ from VOTER).

- **Present letters**:
  - **O** must be in position 1 (deduced from constraints: O excluded from positions 2, 3, 4, 5; only position 1 remains).
  - Secret word format: **O _ T E R**.

- **Absent letters**: A, I, S, N, D, M, V.

### Deductions:
- The missing letter (position 2) must be a valid English letter not in the absent list (e.g., B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z).
- Possible words: **OTTER** (if duplicate T) or **OUTER** (with U).

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- **OUTER** is chosen to test:
  - Whether the missing letter is **U** (if correct, all letters match).
  - If incorrect (e.g., U gets x), the only remaining option is **OTTER** (with duplicate T).
- Testing **OUTER** prioritizes a non-duplicate scenario first.

<guess>OUTER</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses, I have deduced the following:

1. The secret word has fixed letters in positions 3, 4, and 5: **T**, **E**, **R** (as confirmed by ✓ in Guess 4).
2. **O** is in the word but cannot be in position 2 (feedback from Guess 4) or position 5 (feedback from Guess 3). With positions 3, 4, and 5 fixed, **O** must be in position 1.
3. The only remaining position is position 2, which must be filled by a letter not excluded by previous feedback (excluded letters: A, I, S, N, D, M, V).
4. The secret word format is **O _ T E R**.
5. Two valid English words fit this format:
   - **OTTER** (with duplicate T at position 2).
   - **OUTER** (with U at position 2).

I will test **OUTER** first since it does not require a duplicate letter. If it's incorrect, **OTTER** will be the next guess.

So it could be at 5.\n\n However, we also have to consider that we are limited to 5-letter words. ""ENTER"" is valid.\n\n But we want to maximize information. ""BORED"" and ""ENTER"" are both options.\n\n Another common word: ""LONER"" -> L, O, N, E, R. \n  - R is at position 5 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). \n  - No A, I, S.\n\n But note: we have two known letters (R and E) and we are using them.

Now we can try R in positions 2,3,4 and E in 1,2,3,4.\n\n Let me think of a word that has R in position 2 and E in position 4? For example: ""CRANE"" -> but C, R, A, N, E -> A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word).

That\'s allowed.\n\n However, we already know E is in the word, so we are testing T, R (again but in a new position), E (in a new position), N, D.\n\n But we are also testing if R is in position 2? We know R is in the word, but we don\'t know where. So testing R in position 2 is good.\n\n Similarly, we are testing E in position 3.\n\n I think ""TREND"" is a good candidate.\n\n But wait, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn\'t show any duplicate, but we don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ROUTE"": \n  - R, O, U, T, E -> R in position 1? That\'s not allowed because we know R is not in position 1. So we cannot use R in position 1.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid R in position 1.\n\n Let me list some words that have R and E, without A, I, S, and without R in position 1:\n\n  - Position 2: R in second position -> e.g., ""TREND"", ""CREST"" (but C,R,E,S,T -> S is not allowed) -> invalid.\n  - Position 3: R in third -> ""BORED"", ""CORED"", ""GORED"", ""LURED"", etc. But we must avoid S and A and I.\n\n ""BORED"": B, O, R, E, D -> R in 3, E in 4 -> good.\n\n ""LURED"": L, U, R, E, D -> R in 3, E in 4 -> good.\n\n ""CORED"": C, O, R, E, D -> same.\n\n But we don\'t know if the word has O, U, etc.\n\n Another: ""PERKY"" -> P, E, R, K, Y -> E in 2, R in 3 -> but we have E in position 2? That\'s allowed. And R in 3. Also, no A, I, S.\n\n However, we are also testing P, K, Y.\n\n We want to cover common letters. Common consonants: T, N, L, etc. Vowels: O, U, E (we already have E) and we know A is out.\n\n Since we have E, we can try to use other vowels: O, U.\n\n I think ""TREND"" is a good choice because it uses common letters (T, R, E, N, D) and we can get information about T, N, D.\n\n But note: in ""TREND"", we have:\n   T in position 1 -> we don\'t know if T is in the word.\n   R in position 2 -> we know R is in the word, but if it\'s in position 2 we get feedback.\n   E in position 3 -> we know E is in the word, but if it\'s in position 3 we get feedback.\n   N in position 4 -> test N.\n   D in position 5 -> test D.\n\n Also, we avoid A, I, S.\n\n So I will go with ""TREND"".\n\n But wait: what if the secret word has two R\'s? We don\'t know. But we are using R only once. Similarly for E.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t put R and E in the same positions as the first guess? We had R at 1 and E at 5, so now we are putting R at 2 and E at 3? That\'s different.\n\n Let me confirm: the first guess had R at 1 and E at 5. Now we are trying R at 2 and E at 3.\n\n So, I think ""TREND"" is a good second guess.\n\n However, note that the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 3, that\'s a new position.\n\n Let\'s go with ""TREND"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R is in the secret word but not in position 1.\n- E is in the secret word but not in position 5.\n- A, I, and S are not in the secret word.\n\nFor the next guess, I need to:\n1.

So position 1 can be E or other letters not excluded.\n\nExcluded letters: A, I, S, N, D.\n\nCommon letters left: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe also have to include R, E, T.\n\nNow, think of words that have R, E, T and two letters from the above, with constraints on positions.\n\nWe have feedback that R is not in pos1 or 2, E not in 3 or 5, T not in 1.\n\nSo let\'s try to find a word that meets this.\n\nExample: \n- E could be in position 1: then T must be in 2,3,4,5 but not 1. But if E is at 1, then we have E _ _ _ _\n- R must be in 3,4,5.\n- T must be in 2,3,4,5.\n\nPossibly ""ETHER"", but we don\'t know about H and the second E? But we haven\'t eliminated H. However, ""ETHER"" has two E\'s? Let\'s check: \n- E in pos1, T in pos2? But T in pos2: is that allowed? We know T is in the word, but we don\'t know about pos2. However, we have to test. But also, R is in pos5? R can be at pos5.\n\nBut note: we also have to avoid N and D? ""ETHER"" has E, T, H, E, R. So letters: E, T, H, R. H is not excluded.\n\nBut wait, does it have two E\'s? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know. The feedback hasn\'t indicated duplicates yet, but it\'s possible.\n\nHowever, in the first guess, E was tested and marked as ""-"" meaning it\'s in the word but not at pos5. In the second guess, E was at pos3 and marked ""-"", meaning it\'s in the word but not at pos3. So the E could be the same E? Or a different E? It could be the same E, meaning it must be in a position that is not 3 or 5. So positions 1,2,4.\n\nIf there is only one E, then in ""ETHER"", it has E at pos1 and pos4? Then the word has two E\'s. That\'s possible.\n\nBut we need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, consider other words.\n\nAnother option: ""METRO"":\n- M, E, T, R, O -> E at pos2, T at pos3, R at pos4.\nCheck positions:\n  - R at pos4: allowed (since not 1 or 2)\n  - E at pos2: allowed (since not 3 or 5)\n  - T at pos3: allowed (since not 1)\n\nAlso, M and O are new letters not excluded.\n\nThis seems good.\n\nSimilarly, ""METRO"" uses common letters.\n\nAnother example: ""TERM "" is 4 letters, no. We need 5 letters.\n\n""OUTER"": \n- O, U, T, E, R -> but E at 4, R at 5? \nBut E cannot be at 5? Feedback from guess1 E is not at 5. So if E is at 4? That\'s allowed? Yes, E can be at 4. Then R at 5: allowed? R can be at 5. T at pos3: allowed? Yes, T can be anywhere except 1.\n\nBut we have O and U. U is a vowel? We don\'t know if U is in the word.\n\nBut let me check: position of E? If E is at 4: good. \nAlso, we avoid excluded letters.\n\nWe could also try ""METRO"" as suggested.\n\nBut note: in ""METRO"", we have:\n- Position 1: M (not excluded)\n- Position 2: E (which we know is in the word and can be at 2? Yes, because not pos3 or 5)\n- Position 3: T (allowed? T can be at 3, since not 1)\n- Position 4: R (allowed? R not at1 or2, so yes)\n- Position 5: O\n\nAnd we test M and O.\n\nAlso, we use all three known letters.\n\nBut note: we are testing E at position 2 and T at position 3. If the word has E at position 2, then we might get a check mark? Similarly for T at 3.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nAnother word: ""JUMBO"" - no T,R,E.\n\nMust include R,E,T.\n\nLet\'s list candidates:\n- ""METRO"": M, E, T, R, O\n- ""RETRO"": but R at pos1? Not allowed. R cannot be at1.\n- ""LATER"": but A is excluded -> invalid.\n- ""TIGER"": T,I,G,E,R -> I excluded -> invalid.\n- ""PETER"": P, E, T, E, R -> has E twice. \n  - Position: E at2 and4? Then we have E at2: allowed? Yes. T at3: allowed. R at5: allowed. But we are using double E? That\'s possible. However, we have P which is new.\n\nBut we don\'t know if P is allowed.\n\nSame with ""METRO"".\n\nNow, what about ""QUERY"": Q,U,E,R,Y -> but E is at pos3? But E cannot be at pos3 because from guess2 we know E is not at pos3. So invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""QUEUE"" - doesn\'t have R or T.\n\nAnother: ""MERIT"": has I -> invalid.\n\nHow about ""BERET"": B, E, R, E, T -> has E twice? And check positions:\n- Position1: B? not excluded.\n- Position2: E? allowed? Yes, since not 3 or 5.\n- Position3: R? but R cannot be at pos3? Wait, no: R can be at pos3? We know R is not at 1 or 2, but pos3 is allowed? Yes, because feedback only said not pos1 and not pos2, so pos3 is possible.\n- Position4: E? and position5: T? T can be at5? yes.\n\nBut R at pos3? We thought R can be in 3,4,5. So ""BERET"" has R at3: allowed? Yes.\n\nBut we have E at2 and E at4? And T at5? \n\nAlso, B is new.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t used any excluded letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""TOWER"": T at1? Not allowed! T cannot be at1. So ""TOWER"" is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""TROVE"": T at1? invalid.\n\nSo, ""METRO"" seems like a strong candidate because:\n- It tests E at2 and T at3, which are new positions we haven\'t tested.\n- It tests two new common letters: M and O.\n- It satisfies all position constraints.\n\nMoreover, it doesn\'t conflict with known constraints.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""METRO"".\n\nBut let me double-check: \n- Guess1: RAISE: R was in pos1 (wrong pos), now we are putting R in pos4? We haven\'t tested pos4 for R. Same for E: we tested E in pos5 and pos3, now in pos2.\n\nAnd T in pos3? We know T is in the word but not in pos1 (from TREND where T was in pos1). Now we are testing T in pos3.\n\nYes, this should give us more information.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""METRO"".Based on previous feedback:\n\n- **RAISE**: R (wrong position), E (wrong position), A/I/S not in the word.\n- **TREND**: T (wrong position), R (wrong position), E (wrong position), N/D not in the word.\n\n### Deductions:\n1. **Letters in the secret word**: R, E, T must be present (since all received ""-"" feedback).\n2. **Letters NOT in the word**: A, I, S (from RAISE), N, D (from TREND).\n3. **Position constraints**:\n   - R cannot be in position 1 or 2.\n   - E cannot be in position 3 or 5.\n   - T cannot be in position 1.\n4. The secret word has two unknown letters (from the alphabet excluding A/I/S/N/D), and we need to test new common letters like M, O, L, etc.\n5. Possible positions:\n   - R: Positions 3, 4, or 5.\n   - E: Positions 1, 2, or 4.\n   - T: Positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Choose a word that includes R, E, T and two new letters to maximize information, avoiding excluded letters.\n- Place R, E, T in positions that haven’t been tested yet and satisfy the constraints (e.g., R not in 1/2, E not in 3/5, T not in 1).\n- **""METRO""** is a strong candidate:\n  - M (position 1): New consonant.\n  - E (position 2): Tests a new position for E (allowed since E ≠ position 3/5).\n  - T (position 3): Tests a new position for T (allowed since T ≠ position 1).\n  - R (position 4): Tests a new position for R (allowed since R ≠ positions 1/2).\n  - O (position 5): New vowel to test.\n  - Avoids A/I/S/N/D.\n\nThis guess efficiently tests the known letters in new positions while probing two new letters (M and O).\n\n<guess>METRO</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: TREND -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)\nGuess 3: METRO -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) T(✓) R(-) O(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE\n- R: - (in word, not position 1)\n- A: x (not in word)\n- I: x (not in word)\n- S: x (not in word)\n- E: - (in word, not position 5)\n\nGuess 2: TREND\n- T: - (in word, not position 1)\n- R: - (in word, not position 2)\n- E: - (in word, not position 3)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- D: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 3: METRO\n- M: x (not in word)\n- E: - (in word, not position 2)  [since it was in position 2 and got ""-""]\n- T: ✓ (in word and correct position, so T is in position 3)\n- R: - (in word, not position 4)  [since it was in position 4 and got ""-""]\n- O: - (in word, not position 5)\n\nNow, let\'s consolidate what we know:\n\n1. Letters in the word: R, E, T, O (from the feedback, all have been marked as present in some way)\n   - R: present, but not in positions 1, 2, or 4 (from guesses 1, 2, and 3)\n   - E: present, but not in positions 5 (from guess 1), 3 (from guess 2), or 2 (from guess 3). So E cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5. The only positions left are 1 and 4.\n   - T: present and we know it is in position 3 (from guess 3, T is correct at position 3).\n   - O: present, but not in position 5 (from guess 3).\n\n2. Letters not in the word: A, I, S, N, D, M (from the x\'s in all guesses).\n\n3. We have 5 positions. We know T is fixed at position 3.\n\n4. E must be in position 1 or 4 (since it can\'t be in 2,3,5).\n\n5. R must be in position 3 or 5? But position 3 is taken by T. So R cannot be in position 3. Therefore, R must be in position 5? Because the only positions left for R are 3,4,5 and we know not 1,2,4. So 3 and 5? But 3 is taken by T, so R must be in position 5.\n\n   However, let\'s list the positions for R:\n   - Not in 1 (guess1), not in 2 (guess2), not in 4 (guess3). So possible: 3 or 5.\n   But position 3 is occupied by T (fixed). Therefore, R must be in position 5.\n\n6. Now, we have:\n   Position 3: T (fixed)\n   Position 5: R (since it must be there)\n\n7. E must be in position 1 or 4.\n\n8. We have one more letter to find (since the word has 5 letters, and we have R, E, T, O, and one more). But wait, we have four letters: R, E, T, O. So we need one more letter.\n\n   The word must have five distinct letters? Not necessarily, but so far we haven\'t seen duplicates. However, we must consider the possibility of duplicates, but let\'s proceed with distinct for now.\n\n9. The known letters are R, E, T, O, and one unknown. But we also have to place O. O is in the word but not in position 5 (from guess3). So O can be in positions 1,2,3,4? But position 3 is T, so O can be in 1,2,4.\n\n10. Now, let\'s consider the positions:\n\n    Position 1: Could be E or O or the new letter? But E can be in 1 or 4, and O can be in 1,2,4.\n\n    Position 2: Open for O or the new letter? But E cannot be in 2 (from guess3), so position 2 must be either O or the new letter.\n\n    Position 4: Could be E or O or the new letter? But E can be in 4, and O can be in 4.\n\n    However, we have to assign E to either 1 or 4.\n\n    Also, we have to assign O to one of 1,2,4 (but not 5, and 3 is taken).\n\n    And we have one more letter to place in the remaining position.\n\n11. We also know that the word has O, so we must include it.\n\n    Let me denote the positions:\n\n    Pos1: ?\n    Pos2: ?\n    Pos3: T\n    Pos4: ?\n    Pos5: R\n\n    And E must be in pos1 or pos4.\n\n    O must be in pos1, 2, or 4 (but not 5, and 3 is taken).\n\n    Now, if E is in pos1, then:\n        Pos1: E\n        Then O can be in pos2 or pos4.\n        And the remaining position (either 2 or 4) and the other one (if O is in 2, then 4 is open; if O is in 4, then 2 is open) must be the new letter.\n\n    If E is in pos4, then:\n        Pos4: E\n        Then O can be in pos1 or pos2.\n        And the remaining position (1 or 2) must be the new letter.\n\n12. We need to choose a word that fits and tests the possibilities.\n\n    Also, we must avoid the excluded letters: A, I, S, N, D, M.\n\n    Let\'s think of words that end with R, have T in the middle, and contain E and O.\n\n    Possibilities:\n\n    Option 1: E in pos1, O in pos2 -> then pos4 is the new letter. Word: E O T ? R\n        Example: EOTHR? But H is not excluded, but is it a word? ""EOTHR"" is not a word. \n        What about ""EATER""? But A is excluded -> invalid.\n        ""ENTER""? N excluded -> invalid.\n        ""ELTOR""? L not excluded, but is it a word? ""ELTOR"" is not a word.\n\n    Option 2: E in pos1, O in pos4 -> then pos2 is the new letter. Word: E ? T O R\n        This is a common pattern: e.g., ""ECTOR"" (not a word), ""ELTOR"" (no), but ""ECTOR"" isn\'t valid. \n        What about ""EDITOR""? Too long. We need 5 letters: E _ T O R.\n        Examples: ""ECTOR"" not word, ""EKTOR"" not word. \n        Actually, ""ECTOR"" is not a word. But we have ""METRO"" which we already tried? No, we tried METRO and it had M which is excluded.\n\n        Let me think: common words ending in TOR? Like ""VOTER"", but V is not excluded. ""VOTER"": V, O, T, E, R -> but E is in pos4? In ""VOTER"", it\'s V-O-T-E-R, so E is in pos4? But we are considering E in pos1? This is for the pattern E _ T O R, which is not the same.\n\n        For E _ T O R: the letters are E (1), ? (2), T (3), O (4), R (5). So the word must be of the form E?TOR.\n\n        Examples: ""ECTOR"" no, ""EATOR"" no (and A excluded), ""EDITOR"" is 6 letters. \n        Actually, I can\'t think of a common word with E?TOR. \n\n        How about ""EPTOR""? Not a word. \n\n        So maybe E in pos1 and O in pos4 is not common.\n\n    Option 3: E in pos4, O in pos1 -> then pos2 is the new letter. Word: O ? T E R\n        This is the pattern: O _ T E R. \n        Examples: ""OTTER"" -> but T is repeated? ""OTTER"" has two T\'s. \n        In ""OTTER"": O, T, T, E, R -> but we have T at position 3 and also at position 2? That would be two T\'s. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, in our feedback, we haven\'t seen a duplicate yet, but it\'s possible.\n\n        But let\'s check: in guess3, we had T at position 3 and it was correct. If the word has T at position 2 as well, then in guess2 (TREND) we had T at position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That would be consistent because T is in the word but not at 1 (it\'s at 2 and 3). But in guess2, we only had one T and it was at position 1, so the feedback doesn\'t tell us about multiple T\'s. It could be.\n\n        However, in ""OTTER"", we have T at position 2 and 3. But we already have T at position 3 fixed, so if we put T at position 2, that would be a duplicate. But we are trying to avoid duplicates? We don\'t have to, but let\'s see.\n\n        But in this pattern, we are putting O at 1, then a letter at 2, then T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n\n        So the word is O ? T E R.\n\n        Common words: ""OTTER"" (if the second letter is T) -> but then we have two T\'s. \n        Other words: ""OATER"" -> but A is excluded. \n        ""OCTER"" not a word. \n        ""OMTER"" not a word. \n        ""ONTER"" not a word and N excluded. \n        ""OTHER"": O, T, H, E, R -> but T is at position 2? In ""OTHER"", it\'s O-T-H-E-R, so position 2 is T? But we have T at position 3 fixed. So if we put T at position 2, that would be a duplicate T? But the word ""OTHER"" has only one T? No, ""OTHER"" has one T at position 2. But we need T at position 3? So that would be two T\'s? Not in ""OTHER"". \n\n        Actually, ""OTHER"" has O in 1, T in 2, H in 3, E in 4, R in 5. But we need T in position 3. So that doesn\'t match.\n\n        We need a word with O at 1, then a letter (say X) at 2, then T at 3, E at 4, R at 5: O X T E R.\n\n        Examples: ""OTTER"" has O, T, T, E, R -> so positions: O(1), T(2), T(3), E(4), R(5). That works, and it has two T\'s.\n\n        But is ""OTTER"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n        Now, check against feedback:\n        - We have T at position 3 (correct) and also at position 2? But in guess2, we had T at position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That would be consistent because T is in the word (at 2 and 3) but not at 1.\n\n        Also, in guess3, we had T at position 3 and it was correct.\n\n        Now, what about the letters: O is present (we know from guess3) and in this word it\'s at position 1. In guess3, O was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position (O(-)), so that matches because O is not at 5.\n\n        E is at position 4: we know E cannot be at 2,3,5, so 4 is allowed.\n\n        R at position 5: we know R must be at 5 (as deduced).\n\n        And the word has no excluded letters: A,I,S,N,D,M are out, and ""OTTER"" has O,T,E,R (T repeated) so no excluded.\n\n        But we have two T\'s? Is that a problem? The feedback doesn\'t rule out duplicates.\n\n        However, we have to consider if there is a word without duplicate T? Because we haven\'t confirmed duplicates.\n\n        But let\'s see the other option.\n\n    Option 4: E in pos4, O in pos2 -> then pos1 is the new letter. Word: ? O T E R\n        Pattern: ? O T E R\n        Examples: ""COTER"" not common, ""DOTER"" not word, ""HOTER"" not word, ""LOTER"" not word, ""MOTER"" not word (and M excluded), ""POTER"" not word, ""ROTER"" not word, ""TOTER"" -> ""TOTER"" is not a word, but ""TOTER"" might be a misspelling. \n        Actually, ""VOTER"": V O T E R -> but then E is at position 4? In ""VOTER"", it\'s V-O-T-E-R, so E is at 4? But we have E at 4? And R at 5? And T at 3? Yes. \n        But what about the first letter? V is not excluded.\n\n        So ""VOTER"" is a candidate.\n\n        In ""VOTER"":\n          Pos1: V\n          Pos2: O\n          Pos3: T\n          Pos4: E\n          Pos5: R\n\n        This satisfies:\n          E is in pos4 (allowed: not 2,3,5)\n          O is in pos2 (allowed: not 5, and 3 is taken)\n          R is in pos5 (allowed: not 1,2,4)\n          T is in pos3 (correct)\n\n        And we have V as the new letter.\n\n        Also, no duplicate letters.\n\n        Now, we have two candidates: ""OTTER"" (with duplicate T) and ""VOTER"" (with V).\n\n        But we need to see which one is more likely? Or we can test.\n\n        However, we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 out of 6). We need to choose one.\n\n        But note: in ""OTTER"", we have two T\'s. In our previous guesses, we have only tested T in position 1 and 3. In position 1 it was wrong, in position 3 it was correct. But if there is a T in position 2, we haven\'t tested that position for T. So we don\'t know.\n\n        Similarly, for ""VOTER"", we have V which we haven\'t tested.\n\n        How can we distinguish?\n\n        Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests the possibilities without committing to one.\n\n        But we have to include the known letters: R, E, T, O. And we know R is at 5, T at 3, and E must be at 1 or 4, and O at 1,2,4 (but not 3,5).\n\n        Since we have two scenarios, we can try to guess a word that covers both possibilities? But it\'s hard.\n\n        Let\'s list the constraints again:\n\n        We know:\n          Pos3: T\n          Pos5: R\n\n        E must be in 1 or 4.\n\n        O must be in 1,2,4.\n\n        And the remaining position (either 1,2, or 4) is the new letter.\n\n        Actually, if E is in 1, then O can be in 2 or 4, and the other is new.\n        If E is in 4, then O can be in 1 or 2, and the other is new.\n\n        So the unknown positions are 1,2,4, but with constraints.\n\n        We can try to guess a word that has E in position 4 and O in position 2, for example, and a new letter in position 1? That would be ""VOTER"" as above.\n\n        Or if we put E in position 1 and O in position 2, then we have E O T ? R, and we need a letter for position 4. What letter? We haven\'t tested many consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n        For example, ""LOTER"" is not a word, but ""HOTER"" not word. ""DOTER"" not word. ""COTER"" not word. ""POTER"" not word. ""MOTER"" not word. ""NOTER"" -> N is excluded. ""ROTER"" not word. ""BOTER"" not word. ""GOTER"" not word. ""YOTER"" not word. \n\n        Actually, I cannot find a common word for E O T ? R. The only common word I know with that ending is ""VOTER"" but that has V at the beginning and O at 2, not E at 1.\n\n        So perhaps E in position 1 is not possible? Then E must be in position 4.\n\n        And then O must be in position 1 or 2.\n\n        If O is in position 1, then we have O ? T E R, and we need a letter for position 2. The only common word I can think of is ""OTTER"" (with T at 2 and 3) or ""OTHER"" but that has H at 3, not T.\n\n        ""OTHER"" has H at 3, but we need T at 3. So that doesn\'t work.\n\n        So if O is in position 1, then position 2 must be T? But then we have two T\'s: ""OTTER"". \n\n        If O is in position 2, then we have ? O T E R, and the first letter is the new letter. Then ""VOTER"" is a word.\n\n        So the two possibilities are:\n          - ""OTTER"" (O, T, T, E, R) with T at 2 and 3.\n          - ""VOTER"" (V, O, T, E, R) with V at 1.\n\n        Now, how to choose? We can try to guess one of them.\n\n        But note: in ""OTTER"", we have two T\'s. In our previous guess (guess2: TREND), we had T at position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That would be consistent with T being at 2 and 3 (so not at 1). Also, in guess3, we had T at 3 and it was correct.\n\n        For ""VOTER"", we have V at 1, which we haven\'t tested.\n\n        We can try to guess ""VOTER"" to test the V. If it\'s not, then we can fall back to ""OTTER"".\n\n        But we have two guesses left? We are about to make guess 4, and we have 6 total, so we have two more after this.\n\n        Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the position for E and O without guessing the entire word? But we have to include the known letters.\n\n        However, we know T and R are fixed, so we have to build around them.\n\n        Let me think of a word that has:\n          Pos3: T\n          Pos5: R\n          E in position 4 (since we suspect E is in 4, because E in 1 seems difficult)\n          O in position 1? Then we need a letter for position 2. But we don\'t know what that is. Or O in position 2? Then we need a letter for position 1.\n\n        And we want to test a new letter.\n\n        But if we choose ""VOTER"", we are testing V and also confirming the positions for O, E, T, R.\n\n        Similarly, if we choose ""OTTER"", we are testing the duplicate T.\n\n        But to avoid risking a duplicate if it doesn\'t exist, maybe ""VOTER"" is safer? And if ""VOTER"" is wrong, then we know it must be ""OTTER"".\n\n        Also, we can check: in guess3, we had O at position 5 and it was marked as present but not at 5. In ""VOTER"", O is at position 2, which is new. In ""OTTER"", O is at position 1, which is also new.\n\n        So both are possible.\n\n        I think ""VOTER"" is a valid word and fits all the constraints, so I\'ll go with that.\n\n        But let\'s confirm the feedback we would get if the word is ""VOTER"":\n\n        Guess: VOTER\n          V: new letter, if the word is ""VOTER"", then V is correct at position 1 -> ✓\n          O: in the word but not at position 5? In ""VOTER"", O is at 2, so if we guess VOTER, then O is at 2, which is not 5, so it would be -? But actually, if it\'s in the correct position, it should be ✓. \n\n        The feedback for O: in guess3, O was at position 5 and got ""-"", meaning it\'s in the word but not at 5. Now, if we put O at position 2 and it is correct, then we should get ✓.\n\n        Similarly, T at 3 is ✓, E at 4: if the word is ""VOTER"", E is at 4 and that is correct? In ""VOTER"", E is at 4? V-O-T-E-R, so E is at 4. And we know E can be at 4. So it would be ✓.\n\n        R at 5: ✓.\n\n        So if the word is ""VOTER"", we would get all ✓ except V? But V is at 1 and if it\'s correct, then ✓. So all correct.\n\n        But if the word is ""OTTER"", then ""VOTER"" would have V at 1 which is not in the word (since ""OTTER"" has O at 1, not V), so V would be x. Then O at 2: in ""OTTER"", O is at 1, so O is in the word but not at 2? So O would be -. T at 3: ✓. E at 4: ✓ (because ""OTTER"" has E at 4). R at 5: ✓.\n\n        So we can distinguish.\n\n        Therefore, I\'ll guess ""VOTER"".\n\n        If it\'s not, then the only other possibility is ""OTTER"".\n\n        But are there other words? For example, with E in position 4 and O in position 1, and a letter in position 2? We have ""OTTER"" (with T in 2) or is there another? Like ""OATER"" but A excluded. ""OCTER"" not word. So probably only ""OTTER"".\n\n        What about E in position 4 and O in position 2, and a different letter in 1? Like ""VOTER"", but also ""DOTER"" not word, ""COTER"" not word, ""HOTER"" not word, ""POTER"" not word, ""YOTER"" not word. ""WOTER"" not word. ""XOTER"" not word. ""ZOTER"" not word. ""BOTER"" not word. ""GOTER"" not word. ""LOTER"" not word. ""NOTER"" not word and N excluded. So only ""VOTER"" is common.\n\n        Therefore, the two candidates are ""VOTER"" and ""OTTER"".\n\n        I\'ll go with ""VOTER"" as the next guess.\n\n        But note: we have to make sure we don\'t violate any constraints.\n\n        In ""VOTER"":\n          V: not excluded? Yes.\n          O: in word and not at 5? We know O is in the word (from guess3) and we are putting it at 2, which is allowed.\n          T: at 3, correct.\n          E: at 4, which is allowed (E not at 2,3,5 -> 4 is allowed).\n          R: at 5, which is required.\n\n        So it\'s a valid guess.\n\n        Let\'s make the guess: ""VOTER""\n\n        If it\'s not correct, then we can guess ""OTTER"" next.\n\n        But we have two more guesses after this? We are on guess 4, so we have 5 and 6 left.\n\n        So I think it\'s safe.\n\n        Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests the presence of V? But we are already doing that with ""VOTER"".\n\n        So I\'ll go with ""VOTER"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **RAISE**: R (wrong position), E (wrong position), A/I/S not in word.\n- **TREND**: T (wrong position), R (wrong position), E (wrong position), N/D not in word.\n- **METRO**: M not in word, E (wrong position), T (correct position), R (wrong position), O (wrong position).\n\n### Deductions:\n1. **Confirmed letters in secret word**: \n   - **T** is in position 3 (✓ from METRO).\n   - **R**, **E**, and **O** are present but not in tested positions.\n   - **Absent letters**: A, I, S, N, D, M.\n\n2. **Position constraints**:\n   - **R**: Cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (feedback from RAISE, TREND, METRO).

So the secret word ends with ""TER"" (positions 3,4,5: T, E, R).\n- Also, E is fixed at position 4 and R at position 5.\n\nPrevious deductions:\n- R must be at pos5 (from deduction) -> confirmed by Guess4 (R✓ at5).\n- E must be at pos1 or4 -> now fixed at pos4 (from Guess4 E✓ at4).\n- T fixed at pos3.\n\nAfter Guess4, we know the secret word has the form: _ _ T E R\n\nWe also have the following information on letters:\n\nLetters in the word (from all feedback):\n- R (in word, fixed at pos5)\n- E (in word, fixed at pos4)\n- T (in word, fixed at pos3)\n- O (in word, from Guess3 O(-) and Guess4 O(-)) -> but O is in the word, but not at pos5 (from Guess3) and not at pos2 (from Guess4). So O must be at position 1? Because the only positions left are 1 and 2? But the word is _ _ T E R.\n\nGuess4: we guessed VOTER -> O was in position2, and it was marked as O(-), meaning O is in the word but not at position2.\n\nSo for O: \n- It cannot be at pos2 (from Guess4) \n- Cannot be at pos5 (from Guess3)\n- And pos3 and pos4 are taken by T and E? So the only possible position is pos1.\n\nTherefore, O must be at position1.\n\nNow, what about the remaining position? Position2: we don\'t have any information about that letter yet, except that it must be a letter not excluded.\n\nExcluded letters: A, I, S, N, D, M, V (from all the \'x\' marks: A,I,S from Guess1; N,D from Guess2; M from Guess3; V from Guess4).\n\nSo excluded: A,I,S,N,D,M,V.\n\nWe know the word is O _ T E R\n\nWe need a letter for position2 that is not excluded and forms a valid English word.\n\nPossible letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need a word of the form: O?TER\n\nCommon words: \n- ""OTTER"": but that would be O T T E R -> position2 is T, but we already have T at position3. So duplicate T? \n  - But note: in ""OTTER"", we have T at position2 and position3. That is consistent because T is already known to be at position3. \n  - Also, in previous guesses, we haven\'t tested T at position2. However, we know T is in the word and at position3, but it could be duplicated.\n\nBut in Guess2: we guessed TREND (T at pos1, R at pos2, etc.). The feedback for T was ""-"", meaning T is in the word but not at pos1. That doesn\'t tell us about position2.\n\nSimilarly, in Guess4: we have T at pos3 marked correct, but that doesn\'t say anything about duplicates.\n\nSo ""OTTER"" is a possibility.\n\nAnother word: ""OATER"" -> but A is excluded, invalid.\n\n""OUTER"": U in position2? O U T E R -> that\'s a valid word. \nBut U is not excluded? No, U hasn\'t been excluded. But let\'s check: the excluded letters are A,I,S,N,D,M,V. U is not in the list. So ""OUTER"" would be O U T E R.\n\nBut in ""OUTER"", O is at1, U at2, T at3, E at4, R at5.\n\nIs that possible? \n- We know O is in the word and must be at position1? Yes, because O must be at1 (as derived above).\n- U is not excluded and we haven\'t tested it.\n\nBut wait, we also have O already at position1. So for ""OUTER"", O at1 is consistent.\n\nBut in Guess4, we had O in position2 and it was marked O(-), meaning O is in the word but not at pos2. That doesn\'t preclude O at position1? Because O being at position1 is separate.\n\nIn ""OUTER"", we have O at position1 and there is no other O. So the O is at position1.\n\nThe feedback for O in Guess4 was O(-) because we put O in position2 but it is actually at position1? So it\'s in the word, but not at position2. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, in Guess3 (METRO) we had O at position5 and it was O(-), meaning O is not at pos5, which is consistent with O at1.\n\nSo ""OUTER"" is also a candidate.\n\nBut what about ""OTTER""? That has T at position2? And we already have T at position3? So two T\'s? That\'s also possible.\n\nTherefore, we have two candidates:\n1. ""OTTER"" -> O T T E R (with two T\'s)\n2. ""OUTER"" -> O U T E R (with U)\n\nWhich one to choose?\n\nWe can use the fact that we have not tested U yet? Or we can think about the previous feedback.\n\nIn particular, in Guess2: TREND -> T at pos1 and it was marked as ""-"", meaning T is in the word but not at pos1. \n\nIf the word is ""OTTER"", then T is at pos2 and pos3. So indeed, T is not at pos1. \n\nIf the word is ""OUTER"", then T is only at pos3. So T not at pos1 is also consistent.\n\nIn Guess3: METRO -> T at pos3 was ✓, and R at4 was ""-"". In ""OTTER"", R is at pos5? And not at4? So that\'s consistent. Similarly for ""OUTER"".\n\nBut they both seem consistent.\n\nHow to break the tie?\n\nWe can consider that in Guess4: VOTER -> we got V(x), O(-), T(✓), E(✓), R(✓). \n\nIf the word has O at position1, then in Guess4, the letter at position2 was V? But V was not in the word (since V(x)), and position1 was V? But in ""OUTER"", position1 is O? Not V.\n\nIn Guess4, we guessed VOTER -> V at1, O at2, T at3, E at4, R at5.\n\nThe secret word has O at position1 and U at2 for ""OUTER"", or T at2 for ""OTTER"".\n\nSo for the secret word ""OTTER"":\n  Position1: O (not V) -> V is x (correct)\n  Position2: T (but we guessed O) -> O is in the word? Yes, but at position1? So when we guessed O at position2, it was wrong position? So O gets - (which matches the feedback)\n  Positions 3,4,5: T, E, R are correct (✓,✓,✓) -> matches.\n\nFor ""OUTER"":\n  Position1: O (not V) -> V is x (correct)\n  Position2: U (we guessed O) -> O is in the word? Yes, at position1? So O is present but not at position2? So O gets - (matches)\n  Positions 3,4,5: T,E,R are correct -> matches.\n\nSo both ""OTTER"" and ""OUTER"" would give the same feedback for Guess4.\n\nThus, we need to guess one of them.\n\nWe have two more guesses (guess5 and guess6) if needed.\n\nLet me check: are there any other words? Like ""OATER"" -> A excluded. ""OCTER"" not a word. Etc. So only ""OTTER"" and ""OUTER"".\n\nWe can try one of them.\n\nBut to maximize information, we can choose the one with a new letter? But both have a letter in position2 that we haven\'t tested: T and U.\n\nBut we already know T is in the word (and fixed at pos3)? So if we choose ""OUTER"", we test U? Or if we choose ""OTTER"", we test T at a new position?\n\nBut we already know T is in the word, so testing T at position2 might not be new information? Whereas U is completely new.\n\nSo ""OUTER"" tests U? Yes.\n\nHowever, if we guess ""OTTER"" and it\'s wrong, then we know it must be ""OUTER"". And vice versa.\n\nSo we can pick one arbitrarily.\n\nI\'ll pick ""OUTER"" because it doesn\'t have a duplicate letter, which might be less likely? (But the game allows duplicates.)\n\nBut to be safe, we can guess ""OUTER"".\n\nThen, if it\'s wrong, we guess ""OTTER"".\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""OUTER"". \n\nBut let me write the word: O U T E R.\n\nYes.\n\nBut note: position2 is U, which we haven\'t tested before.\n\nSo we\'ll see.\n\nTherefore, the guess is ""OUTER"".Based on the accumulated feedback:\n\n- **Fixed positions**: \n  - Position 3: **T** (✓ from METRO and VOTER).\n  - Position 4: **E** (✓ from VOTER).\n  - Position 5: **R** (✓ from VOTER).\n\n- **Present letters**:\n  - **O** must be in position 1 (deduced from constraints: O excluded from positions 2, 3, 4, 5; only position 1 remains).\n  - Secret word format: **O _ T E R**.\n\n- **Absent letters**: A, I, S, N, D, M, V.\n\n### Deductions:\n- The missing letter (position 2) must be a valid English letter not in the absent list (e.g., B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z).\n- Possible words: **OTTER** (if duplicate T) or **OUTER** (with U).\n\n### Strategy for Guess 5:\n- **OUTER** is chosen to test:\n  - Whether the missing letter is **U** (if correct, all letters match).\n  - If incorrect (e.g., U gets x), the only remaining option is **OTTER** (with duplicate T).\n- Testing **OUTER** prioritizes a non-duplicate scenario first.\n\n<guess>OUTER</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses, I have deduced the following:\n\n1.

The only remaining position is position 2, which must be filled by a letter not excluded by previous feedback (excluded letters: A, I, S, N, D, M, V).\n4. The secret word format is **O _ T E R**.\n5. Two valid English words fit this format:\n   - **OTTER** (with duplicate T at position 2).\n   - **OUTER** (with U at position 2).\n\nI will test **OUTER** first since it does not require a duplicate letter. If it\'s incorrect, **OTTER** will be the next guess.\n\n<guess>OUTER</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: TREND -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)\nGuess 3: METRO -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) T(✓) R(-) O(-)\nGuess 4: VOTER -> FEEDBACK: V(x) O(-) T(✓) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 5: OUTER -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) U(x) T(✓) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from Guess 5: OUTER -> O(✓) U(x) T(✓) E(✓) R(✓)

This means:
- O is correct at position 1 (✓)
- U is not in the word (x)
- T is correct at position 3 (✓)
- E is correct at position 4 (✓)
- R is correct at position 5 (✓)

Therefore, the secret word is O _ T E R, and the second letter is not U and must be one that hasn't been excluded.

Excluded letters so far (from all feedback):
- From Guess1: A, I, S
- From Guess2: N, D
- From Guess3: M
- From Guess4: V
- From Guess5: U

So excluded: A, I, S, N, D, M, V, U.

The only possibility left is that the second letter is T, making the word ""OTTER"". This is because:
- We know T is already in the word at position 3, but it can appear again at position 2 (duplicate T).
- There are no other common English words of the form O?TER that fit the constraints (e.g., ""OCTER"", ""OATER"", etc., are not valid words or contain excluded letters).

Thus, the secret word must be ""OTTER"".

We can now make the final guess: ""OTTER"".

But note: we have one more guess (if needed) but we are confident.

So the next guess is ""OTTER"".

Based on the feedback from all guesses, the secret word is now confirmed:

  - **O** is correct at position 1.  
  - **U** is absent (new exclusion).  
  - **T**, **E**, **R** remain correct at positions 3, 4, 5.  

### Final Deductions:
1. **Secret word format**: **O _ T E R** (positions 1, 3, 4, 5 fixed).  
2. **Excluded letters**: A, I, S, N, D, M, V, U.  
3. **Position 2** must be a letter not excluded and valid in English:  
   - Only possible letter is **T** (forming **OTTER**), as it is the only common word fitting:  
     - **OTTER**: O (position 1), T (position 2), T (position 3), E (position 4), R (position 5).  
   - Duplicate T is consistent with prior feedback (T was never tested in position 2).  

### Final Guess:
The secret word is **OTTER**.

- U is not in the word (x)
- T is correct at position 3 (✓)
- E is correct at position 4 (✓)
- R is correct at position 5 (✓)

Therefore, the secret word is O _ T E R, and the second letter is not U and must be one that hasn't been excluded.

Excluded letters so far (from all feedback):
- From Guess1: A, I, S
- From Guess2: N, D
- From Guess3: M
- From Guess4: V
- From Guess5: U

So excluded: A, I, S, N, D, M, V, U.

The only possibility left is that the second letter is T, making the word ""OTTER"". This is because:
- We know T is already in the word at position 3, but it can appear again at position 2 (duplicate T).
- There are no other common English words of the form O?TER that fit the constraints (e.g., ""OCTER"", ""OATER"", etc., are not valid words or contain excluded letters).

Thus, the secret word must be ""OTTER"".

We can now make the final guess: ""OTTER"".

But note: we have one more guess (if needed) but we are confident.

So the next guess is ""OTTER"".Based on the feedback from all guesses, the secret word is now confirmed:

- **Guess 5: OUTER** → O(✓) U(x) T(✓) E(✓) R(✓)  
  - **O** is correct at position 1.  
  - **U** is absent (new exclusion).  
  - **T**, **E**, **R** remain correct at positions 3, 4, 5.  

### Final Deductions:
1. **Secret word format**: **O _ T E R** (positions 1, 3, 4, 5 fixed).  
2. **Excluded letters**: A, I, S, N, D, M, V, U.  
3. **Position 2** must be a letter not excluded and valid in English:  
   - Only possible letter is **T** (forming **OTTER**), as it is the only common word fitting:  
     - **OTTER**: O (position 1), T (position 2), T (position 3), E (position 4), R (position 5).  
   - Duplicate T is consistent with prior feedback (T was never tested in position 2).
