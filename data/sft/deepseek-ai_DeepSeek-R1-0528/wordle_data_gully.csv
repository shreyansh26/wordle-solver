We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we want a word that can provide maximum information.
 The ideal first guess should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize coverage.
 Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T, N).
 One classic starting word is ""CRANE"" because it contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R) and covers multiple common letters.
 Another good option is ""SLATE"". However, let me pick a word that I know is common and well-balanced.

 Let's choose ""ROATE"". This word is commonly used as it contains four common letters including vowels and consonants.
 However, note that the game requires valid English words. ""ROATE"" is valid? Actually, I think ""ROATE"" is less common. Let me think again.

 Instead, I'll go with ""CRANE"". It's a valid word and a popular starter.

 Guess: CRANE

 But note: the game does not require the word to be a common word? It just must be a valid English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Therefore, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

We are starting with the first guess: REAST, and the feedback was all 'x', meaning none of the letters R, E, A, S, T are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 Since the first guess eliminated 5 common letters, we need to pick a new word that uses none of R, E, A, S, T.

 We have to choose from the remaining letters. We should aim for another set of common letters to maximize information.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding R, E, A, S, T) might include: O, I, L, N, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

 We want a word that uses as many of the remaining common letters as possible and doesn't repeat letters.

 Let's consider some words:
 - Could use ""OUIJA"" but that has a J which is less common and also repeats? Actually, ""OUIJA"" is 5 letters but has a J and is not very common. Also, it has two I's? No, O-U-I-J-A: unique letters? O, U, I, J, A -> but A is already eliminated. We cannot use A.

 We cannot use A because it was in the first guess and was marked as not present.

 So, we must avoid: R, E, A, S, T.

 Let's think of words without these letters. Some possibilities:

 - ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D -> all new letters. This is a valid word.
 - ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D -> also valid and common.
 - ""MOUND"": M, O, U, N, D -> similar.

 But note: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common remaining letters might be O, I, L, N, U, D, C, M, P, H, etc.

 Another idea: ""CHINO"" (a type of cloth) -> C, H, I, N, O. But that's 5 letters? C-H-I-N-O? Actually, ""CHINO"" is 5 letters? Wait, it's 5: C-H-I-N-O.

 However, we might also consider ""LYNCH"" but that has Y and H which are less common.

 Alternatively, ""OILED"" has E which is eliminated? We cannot use E.

 We must avoid E as well.

 Let's list some words without R, E, A, S, T:

 - ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D
 - ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D
 - ""MOUND"": M, O, U, N, D
 - ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D
 - ""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D
 - ""CHILD"": C, H, I, L, D
 - ""WOUND"": W, O, U, N, D -> but W is less common.

 We also have to consider that we are in the second guess and we want to maximize the chance of hitting some letters.

 Another good one: ""DOING"" -> D, O, I, N, G -> but G is not extremely common, but acceptable.

 However, note that we have 6 tries, so we can afford to be systematic.

 I think ""POUND"" is a good candidate because it uses P, O, U, N, D which are fairly common and we haven't tried any of them.

 Alternatively, ""CLOUD"" is also good.

 But let me check: the word must be valid. Both are valid.

 I'll go with ""CLOUD"" because it has C and L which are common.

 So, the next guess: CLOUD.

 But note: we are not using any of the forbidden letters (R, E, A, S, T). So it's safe.

 Therefore, I choose ""CLOUD"".
</think>
Based on the feedback for ""REAST"" (all letters marked as 'x'), none of the letters R, E, A, S, or T are in the secret word. For the next guess, I need to avoid these letters entirely and prioritize common English letters not yet tested, such as O, I, L, N, U, D, C, M, or P. The goal is to maximize new information by covering frequent consonants and vowels.

After evaluating options like ""POUND,"" ""BUILD,"" and ""DOING,"" I selected **""CLOUD""** because:
- It uses 5 new, common letters (C, L, O, U, D).
- It avoids redundant letters and excluded characters.
- It tests vowels (O, U) and frequent consonants (C, L, D) in varied positions.

Since it\'s the first guess, we want a word that can provide maximum information.\n The ideal first guess should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize coverage.\n Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T, N).\n One classic starting word is ""CRANE"" because it contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R) and covers multiple common letters.\n Another good option is ""SLATE"". However, let me pick a word that I know is common and well-balanced.\n\n Let\'s choose ""ROATE"". This word is commonly used as it contains four common letters including vowels and consonants.\n However, note that the game requires valid English words. ""ROATE"" is valid?

Since this is the first attempt, I want a word that maximizes information by covering common English letters, including vowels and frequent consonants. The goal is to reveal as much about the secret word\'s structure as possible. I\'ll prioritize letters like R, S, T, L, N, E, A – which appear frequently in 5-letter words. A balanced word with minimal repeated letters is ideal for broad coverage.\n\nAfter considering options like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" and ""ROAST,"" I choose **""REAST""** (meaning to dry by exposure to heat or air). It includes two vowels (E, A) and three common consonants (R, S, T), while avoiding redundancy. This combination should give useful feedback across all positions.\n\n<guess>REAST</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: REAST -> FEEDBACK: R(x) E(x) A(x) S(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are starting with the first guess: REAST, and the feedback was all \'x\', meaning none of the letters R, E, A, S, T are in the secret word.\n Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.\n\n Since the first guess eliminated 5 common letters, we need to pick a new word that uses none of R, E, A, S, T.\n\n We have to choose from the remaining letters. We should aim for another set of common letters to maximize information.\n\n Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding R, E, A, S, T) might include: O, I, L, N, U, D, C, M, P, etc.\n\n We want a word that uses as many of the remaining common letters as possible and doesn\'t repeat letters.\n\n Let\'s consider some words:\n - Could use ""OUIJA"" but that has a J which is less common and also repeats? Actually, ""OUIJA"" is 5 letters but has a J and is not very common. Also, it has two I\'s? No, O-U-I-J-A: unique letters? O, U, I, J, A -> but A is already eliminated. We cannot use A.\n\n We cannot use A because it was in the first guess and was marked as not present.\n\n So, we must avoid: R, E, A, S, T.\n\n Let\'s think of words without these letters. Some possibilities:\n\n - ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D -> all new letters. This is a valid word.\n - ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D -> also valid and common.\n - ""MOUND"": M, O, U, N, D -> similar.\n\n But note: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common remaining letters might be O, I, L, N, U, D, C, M, P, H, etc.\n\n Another idea: ""CHINO"" (a type of cloth) -> C, H, I, N, O. But that\'s 5 letters? C-H-I-N-O? Actually, ""CHINO"" is 5 letters? Wait, it\'s 5: C-H-I-N-O.\n\n However, we might also consider ""LYNCH"" but that has Y and H which are less common.\n\n Alternatively, ""OILED"" has E which is eliminated? We cannot use E.\n\n We must avoid E as well.\n\n Let\'s list some words without R, E, A, S, T:\n\n - ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D\n - ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D\n - ""MOUND"": M, O, U, N, D\n - ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D\n - ""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D\n - ""CHILD"": C, H, I, L, D\n - ""WOUND"": W, O, U, N, D -> but W is less common.\n\n We also have to consider that we are in the second guess and we want to maximize the chance of hitting some letters.\n\n Another good one: ""DOING"" -> D, O, I, N, G -> but G is not extremely common, but acceptable.\n\n However, note that we have 6 tries, so we can afford to be systematic.\n\n I think ""POUND"" is a good candidate because it uses P, O, U, N, D which are fairly common and we haven\'t tried any of them.\n\n Alternatively, ""CLOUD"" is also good.\n\n But let me check: the word must be valid.

So it\'s safe.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""CLOUD"".Based on the feedback for ""REAST"" (all letters marked as \'x\'), none of the letters R, E, A, S, or T are in the secret word. For the next guess, I need to avoid these letters entirely and prioritize common English letters not yet tested, such as O, I, L, N, U, D, C, M, or P. The goal is to maximize new information by covering frequent consonants and vowels.\n\nAfter evaluating options like ""POUND,"" ""BUILD,"" and ""DOING,"" I selected **""CLOUD""** because:\n- It uses 5 new, common letters (C, L, O, U, D).\n- It avoids redundant letters and excluded characters.\n- It tests vowels (O, U) and frequent consonants (C, L, D) in varied positions.\n\n<guess>CLOUD</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: REAST -> FEEDBACK: R(x) E(x) A(x) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 2: CLOUD -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) O(x) U(-) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have two guesses so far:
1. REAST: all letters absent (R, E, A, S, T not in the word)
2. CLOUD: C, O, D absent; L and U present but in the wrong positions.

So, the secret word contains L and U, but not in the positions we guessed (position 2 and 4 respectively in ""CLOUD"").

Since L and U are present, we know:
- L is in the word, but not in the second position.
- U is in the word, but not in the fourth position.

Also, we know the word does not contain: R, E, A, S, T, C, O, D.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Includes L and U (since they are present, we should use them to find their correct positions)
- Avoids the absent letters: R, E, A, S, T, C, O, D.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

What letters are left? We have used: R,E,A,S,T,C,L,O,U,D.

Remaining letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know that L and U must be in the word, so we have to include them in the next guess, but in different positions.

Let's think about possible positions for L and U.

In ""CLOUD"", L was in position 2 and U in position 4. So for the next guess, we should try L in a different position (not 2) and U in a different position (not 4).

We also need to choose three other letters from the remaining set.

Common letters among the remaining: N, H, I, M, P, B, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Let's try to form a word that includes L and U, and three new common letters, and avoids the forbidden ones.

Possible words:

- We need L and U, and three from: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, etc.

Example: ""PLUMB"" -> but B is at the end? Let's check: P-L-U-M-B. But we have to avoid positions? We don't know the positions yet.

But note: we cannot use P? We haven't used P yet, so it's allowed.

But let's see if ""PLUMB"" is valid? It is a word (meaning to measure depth or to weight with lead).

But it has M and B, which are new.

However, we have to consider the positions: in ""CLOUD"", L was in position 2 and U in 4. Now in ""PLUMB"", L is in position 2 again? We know L is not in position 2, so we cannot put L in position 2. Similarly, U is in position 3, which is different from 4, so that's okay.

But in ""PLUMB"", L is in position 2, which we know is incorrect. So we must avoid putting L in position 2.

Therefore, we need a word where L is not in position 2 and U is not in position 4.

Let me try to think of words with L and U, avoiding positions 2 for L and 4 for U.

Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 4, 5
Possible positions for U: 1, 2, 3, 5

Also, the word must not contain R,E,A,S,T,C,O,D.

Let me list some candidate words:

- ""BLUFF"": B-L-U-F-F -> but has two F's? And F is new. But L is in position 2? We cannot have L in position 2. So invalid.

- ""FLUNG"": F-L-U-N-G -> L is in position 2 again? Not allowed.

- ""GLUED"": but E and D are forbidden (from first and second guess). E and D are out.

- ""PLUMY"": P-L-U-M-Y -> L in position 2? Not allowed.

- ""UNLIT"": U-N-L-I-T -> but T is forbidden (from first guess).

- ""BUILT"": B-U-I-L-T -> T forbidden.

- ""GUILD"": G-U-I-L-D -> D forbidden.

- ""QUILT"": Q-U-I-L-T -> T forbidden.

- ""MULCH"": M-U-L-C-H -> C forbidden.

- ""PULPY"": P-U-L-P-Y -> L is in position 3? That's okay (not 2). U is in position 2? That's okay (not 4). And positions: 1:P, 2:U, 3:L, 4:P, 5:Y. But it has two P's? That might not be ideal because we are trying to maximize information, but it's acceptable if the word is valid. Also, P is new, Y is new.

But we have two P's? That means we are testing P only once effectively. Also, we don't know if P is in the word or not.

But ""PULPY"" is a valid word (resembling pulp).

However, we are using two P's, which might not be efficient. Also, we are not testing other letters.

Alternative: ""HUMID"" -> H-U-M-I-D -> but D is forbidden.

""JUMBO"" -> J-U-M-B-O -> O is forbidden.

""LUMBI"" not a word.

""UNLID"" not a word.

""FLUID"": F-L-U-I-D -> D forbidden.

""GUILT"": T forbidden.

""BUYIN"": B-U-Y-I-N -> no L? We must include L because we know it's in the word.

We have to include both L and U.

Another idea: ""UNIFY"" -> U-N-I-F-Y -> no L.

""UNCLIP"" too long.

What about ""BLUEP""? Not a word.

""PLUCK"": P-L-U-C-K -> C forbidden.

""FLUKE"": F-L-U-K-E -> E forbidden.

""PLUMB"": as before, but L in position 2 not allowed.

We need to avoid position 2 for L.

So let's try to put L in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Position 1: L _ _ _ _

With U somewhere not 4.

For example: ""LUNCH"" -> L-U-N-C-H -> C forbidden.

""LURCH"" -> R and C forbidden.

""LUCKY"" -> C forbidden.

""LUMPS"" -> S forbidden.

""LUPUS"" -> S forbidden and two U's? L-U-P-U-S -> not 5 unique? But we can have repeated letters? The rules don't say we can't, but in Wordle, words can have repeated letters. However, in this case, we are trying to maximize information, so unique letters are better. Also, S is forbidden.

""LINGU"" not a word.

""LOGIN"" -> O and G? O is forbidden.

""LYNCH"" -> Y, N, C, H -> C forbidden.

""PILUM"" not a word.

""ULNAR"" -> R forbidden.

""ULCER"" -> R and C forbidden.

""ULTRA"" -> R and A forbidden.

This is getting difficult.

What about ""BLIMP"": B-L-I-M-P -> L is in position 2? Not allowed.

""GLYPH"": G-L-Y-P-H -> L in position 2? Not allowed.

We need to avoid L in position 2.

So let's try L in position 3: _ _ L _ _

With U in 1,2, or 5? (since not 4)

For example: ""PULPY"" we had, but with two P's.

Another: ""FULLY"" -> F-U-L-L-Y -> two L's? And U in position 2. But we have two L's, which is not ideal, but acceptable. Also, F and Y are new.

But we know L is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? It might, but we are not sure. So testing with two L's might not be efficient.

But let's see: ""FULLY"" is a valid word.

Positions: 1:F, 2:U, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y.

We know L is not in position 2 (from previous feedback), but it could be in 3 or 4? In this guess, we have L in 3 and 4. But we don't know which one is correct, or if both are? But the feedback will tell us.

But we are also using U in position 2, which is allowed (since previously U was in 4, not 2).

Another option: ""BULKY"" -> B-U-L-K-Y -> L in position 3? That's okay. U in position 2? Okay. And B, K, Y are new.

""BULKY"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""GULPY"" not a word.

""PULKA"" not a word.

""SULKY"" -> S forbidden.

So ""BULKY"" seems good: B, U, L, K, Y. All new except U and L.

Positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:L, 4:K, 5:Y.

We are putting U in position 2 (which is new) and L in position 3 (which is new, since previously L was in 2 and now 3).

Also, we are testing B, K, Y.

Another possibility: ""HULKY"" -> H-U-L-K-Y, similar.

But ""BULKY"" is more common.

We could put L in position 4.

For example: ""FUNKY"" -> F-U-N-K-Y -> no L? We must include L.

""PUNKY"" -> P-U-N-K-Y -> no L.

""BUNKO"" -> O forbidden.

""JUMBO"" -> O forbidden.

""DUMPY"" -> D forbidden.

""GUMPY"" not a word.

""LUMPY"" -> L-U-M-P-Y -> L in position 1? Then U in position 2. And M, P, Y new.

""LUMPY"": 1:L, 2:U, 3:M, 4:P, 5:Y.

But L is in position 1, which is new (previously was in 2). U in position 2, which is new (previously in 4). So that's good.

""LUMPY"" is a valid word (full of lumps).

Similarly, ""BUMPY"" -> B-U-M-P-Y -> same, but with B instead of L? But we need L. ""BUMPY"" has no L.

So ""LUMPY"" has L and U.

But in ""LUMPY"", L is in 1 and U in 2.

We could also have L in position 5: _ _ _ _ L

With U not in 4.

For example: ""PUDL"" not 5 letters.

""FUGAL"" -> F-U-G-A-L -> A forbidden.

""JUGAL"" -> J-U-G-A-L -> A forbidden.

""MANUL"" not common.

So ""LUMPY"" and ""BULKY"" are candidates.

Between ""BULKY"" and ""LUMPY"", which is better?

""BULKY"": tests B, U, L, K, Y. U in pos2, L in pos3.
""LUMPY"": tests L, U, M, P, Y. L in pos1, U in pos2.

Both avoid the forbidden letters and positions.

We also have to consider frequency of letters. B, K, Y vs M, P, Y.

M and P are more common than K and B? Let's see:

Common letters: M, P are more common than B and K? Actually, in English, P is more common than K and B? According to letter frequency:

E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... then C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, ...

So M is more common than P, B, K? M is 14th, P is 16th, B is 19th, K is 20th. So M and P are slightly more common than B and K.

But Y is the same in both.

Also, ""LUMPY"" has M and P, which might be more likely.

But we are also testing L in position 1 in ""LUMPY"", which we haven't tried before, and in ""BULKY"" L in position 3.

Similarly for U, both have U in position 2.

We don't have strong reason to prefer one over the other.

Another word: ""GULPH"" not common.

""WULIK"" not a word.

""BLUET"" T forbidden.

I think both ""BULKY"" and ""LUMPY"" are acceptable.

But let's consider that in ""CLOUD"", we had L absent in position 2 and U absent in position 4. Now, if we put U in position 2, it might be correct? We don't know.

Similarly, L in position 1 or 3 might be correct.

I'll go with ""BULKY"" because it has a good mix.

But we have another option: ""UNLID"" not a word.

""FLUID"" forbidden letters.

What about ""BUILD""? B-U-I-L-D -> D is forbidden (from second guess, D was absent).

D is out, so ""BUILD"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""GUILD"" has D.

""QUILL"" -> Q-U-I-L-L -> two L's, and Q is rare. Also, L in position 4? But we can try.

But two L's might not be ideal.

""QUILL"" has U in position 2 and L in position 4 and 5? Q-U-I-L-L, so L in 4 and 5.

But we don't know if L is repeated.

I think ""BULKY"" is better.

Another word: ""PULIK"" not a word.

""KULAK"" -> K-U-L-A-K -> A forbidden and two K's.

Not good.

So I think ""BULKY"" is a solid choice.

But let's confirm the letters: B, U, L, K, Y.

We haven't used B, K, Y before, and U and L are known to be present.

Also, positions: U in 2 (new position), L in 3 (new position).

So we can get information about U in 2 and L in 3, and also test B, K, Y.

Therefore, I'll go with ""BULKY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback:
- ""REAST"" had all letters absent (R, E, A, S, T excluded).
- ""CLOUD"" had C, O, D absent (further excluding these) and L/U present but in wrong positions (L not in position 2, U not in position 4).

The secret word contains L and U, but not in the previous guessed positions. For the next guess:
- Must include L and U (to test new positions).
- Avoid excluded letters: R, E, A, S, T, C, O, D.
- Prioritize new common letters (e.g., B, K, Y) to maximize information.
- Test L in a new position (not 2) and U in a new position (not 4).

After evaluating options like ""LUMPY"" and ""BULKY,"" I chose **""BULKY""** because:
- It includes L (position 3) and U (position 2), both in untested positions.
- It introduces new common letters: B, K, Y.
- It avoids redundant letters and all excluded characters.

We are putting U in position 2 (which is new) and L in position 3 (which is new, since previously L was in 2 and now 3).

Also, we are testing B, K, Y.

Another possibility: ""HULKY"" -> H-U-L-K-Y, similar.

But ""BULKY"" is more common.

We could put L in position 4.

For example: ""FUNKY"" -> F-U-N-K-Y -> no L? We must include L.

""PUNKY"" -> P-U-N-K-Y -> no L.

""BUNKO"" -> O forbidden.

""JUMBO"" -> O forbidden.

""DUMPY"" -> D forbidden.

""GUMPY"" not a word.

""LUMPY"" -> L-U-M-P-Y -> L in position 1? Then U in position 2. And M, P, Y new.

""LUMPY"": 1:L, 2:U, 3:M, 4:P, 5:Y.

But L is in position 1, which is new (previously was in 2). U in position 2, which is new (previously in 4). So that's good.

""LUMPY"" is a valid word (full of lumps).

Similarly, ""BUMPY"" -> B-U-M-P-Y -> same, but with B instead of L? But we need L. ""BUMPY"" has no L.

So ""LUMPY"" has L and U.

But in ""LUMPY"", L is in 1 and U in 2.

We could also have L in position 5: _ _ _ _ L

With U not in 4.

For example: ""PUDL"" not 5 letters.

""FUGAL"" -> F-U-G-A-L -> A forbidden.

""JUGAL"" -> J-U-G-A-L -> A forbidden.

""MANUL"" not common.

So ""LUMPY"" and ""BULKY"" are candidates.

Between ""BULKY"" and ""LUMPY"", which is better?

""BULKY"": tests B, U, L, K, Y. U in pos2, L in pos3.
""LUMPY"": tests L, U, M, P, Y. L in pos1, U in pos2.

Both avoid the forbidden letters and positions.

We also have to consider frequency of letters. B, K, Y vs M, P, Y.

M and P are more common than K and B? Let's see:

Common letters: M, P are more common than B and K? Actually, in English, P is more common than K and B? According to letter frequency:

E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... then C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, ...

So M is more common than P, B, K? M is 14th, P is 16th, B is 19th, K is 20th. So M and P are slightly more common than B and K.

But Y is the same in both.

Also, ""LUMPY"" has M and P, which might be more likely.

But we are also testing L in position 1 in ""LUMPY"", which we haven't tried before, and in ""BULKY"" L in position 3.

Similarly for U, both have U in position 2.

We don't have strong reason to prefer one over the other.

Another word: ""GULPH"" not common.

""WULIK"" not a word.

""BLUET"" T forbidden.

I think both ""BULKY"" and ""LUMPY"" are acceptable.

But let's consider that in ""CLOUD"", we had L absent in position 2 and U absent in position 4. Now, if we put U in position 2, it might be correct? We don't know.

Similarly, L in position 1 or 3 might be correct.

I'll go with ""BULKY"" because it has a good mix.

But we have another option: ""UNLID"" not a word.

""FLUID"" forbidden letters.

What about ""BUILD""? B-U-I-L-D -> D is forbidden (from second guess, D was absent).

D is out, so ""BUILD"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""GUILD"" has D.

""QUILL"" -> Q-U-I-L-L -> two L's, and Q is rare. Also, L in position 4? But we can try.

But two L's might not be ideal.

""QUILL"" has U in position 2 and L in position 4 and 5? Q-U-I-L-L, so L in 4 and 5.

But we don't know if L is repeated.

I think ""BULKY"" is better.

Another word: ""PULIK"" not a word.

""KULAK"" -> K-U-L-A-K -> A forbidden and two K's.

Not good.

So I think ""BULKY"" is a solid choice.

But let's confirm the letters: B, U, L, K, Y.

We haven't used B, K, Y before, and U and L are known to be present.

Also, positions: U in 2 (new position), L in 3 (new position).

So we can get information about U in 2 and L in 3, and also test B, K, Y.

Therefore, I'll go with ""BULKY"".Based on the feedback:
- ""REAST"" had all letters absent (R, E, A, S, T excluded).
- ""CLOUD"" had C, O, D absent (further excluding these) and L/U present but in wrong positions (L not in position 2, U not in position 4).

The secret word contains L and U, but not in the previous guessed positions. For the next guess:
- Must include L and U (to test new positions).
- Avoid excluded letters: R, E, A, S, T, C, O, D.
- Prioritize new common letters (e.g., B, K, Y) to maximize information.
- Test L in a new position (not 2) and U in a new position (not 4).

After evaluating options like ""LUMPY"" and ""BULKY,"" I chose **""BULKY""** because:
- It includes L (position 3) and U (position 2), both in untested positions.
- It introduces new common letters: B, K, Y.
- It avoids redundant letters and all excluded characters.",Guess 3: BULKY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) L(✓) K(x) Y(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we want a word that can provide maximum information.
 The ideal first guess should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize coverage.
 Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T, N).
 One classic starting word is ""CRANE"" because it contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R) and covers multiple common letters.
 Another good option is ""SLATE"". However, let me pick a word that I know is common and well-balanced.

 Let's choose ""ROATE"". This word is commonly used as it contains four common letters including vowels and consonants.
 However, note that the game requires valid English words. ""ROATE"" is valid? Actually, I think ""ROATE"" is less common. Let me think again.

 Instead, I'll go with ""CRANE"". It's a valid word and a popular starter.

 Guess: CRANE

 But note: the game does not require the word to be a common word? It just must be a valid English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Therefore, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".I need to make the first guess in Wordle. Since this is the first attempt, I want a word that maximizes information by covering common English letters, including vowels and frequent consonants. The goal is to reveal as much about the secret word's structure as possible. I'll prioritize letters like R, S, T, L, N, E, A – which appear frequently in 5-letter words. A balanced word with minimal repeated letters is ideal for broad coverage.

After considering options like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" and ""ROAST,"" I choose **""REAST""** (meaning to dry by exposure to heat or air). It includes two vowels (E, A) and three common consonants (R, S, T), while avoiding redundancy. This combination should give useful feedback across all positions.

<guess>REAST</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: REAST -> FEEDBACK: R(x) E(x) A(x) S(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are starting with the first guess: REAST, and the feedback was all 'x', meaning none of the letters R, E, A, S, T are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 Since the first guess eliminated 5 common letters, we need to pick a new word that uses none of R, E, A, S, T.

 We have to choose from the remaining letters. We should aim for another set of common letters to maximize information.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding R, E, A, S, T) might include: O, I, L, N, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

 We want a word that uses as many of the remaining common letters as possible and doesn't repeat letters.

 Let's consider some words:
 - Could use ""OUIJA"" but that has a J which is less common and also repeats? Actually, ""OUIJA"" is 5 letters but has a J and is not very common. Also, it has two I's? No, O-U-I-J-A: unique letters? O, U, I, J, A -> but A is already eliminated. We cannot use A.

 We cannot use A because it was in the first guess and was marked as not present.

 So, we must avoid: R, E, A, S, T.

 Let's think of words without these letters. Some possibilities:

 - ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D -> all new letters. This is a valid word.
 - ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D -> also valid and common.
 - ""MOUND"": M, O, U, N, D -> similar.

 But note: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common remaining letters might be O, I, L, N, U, D, C, M, P, H, etc.

 Another idea: ""CHINO"" (a type of cloth) -> C, H, I, N, O. But that's 5 letters? C-H-I-N-O? Actually, ""CHINO"" is 5 letters? Wait, it's 5: C-H-I-N-O.

 However, we might also consider ""LYNCH"" but that has Y and H which are less common.

 Alternatively, ""OILED"" has E which is eliminated? We cannot use E.

 We must avoid E as well.

 Let's list some words without R, E, A, S, T:

 - ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D
 - ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D
 - ""MOUND"": M, O, U, N, D
 - ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D
 - ""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D
 - ""CHILD"": C, H, I, L, D
 - ""WOUND"": W, O, U, N, D -> but W is less common.

 We also have to consider that we are in the second guess and we want to maximize the chance of hitting some letters.

 Another good one: ""DOING"" -> D, O, I, N, G -> but G is not extremely common, but acceptable.

 However, note that we have 6 tries, so we can afford to be systematic.

 I think ""POUND"" is a good candidate because it uses P, O, U, N, D which are fairly common and we haven't tried any of them.

 Alternatively, ""CLOUD"" is also good.

 But let me check: the word must be valid. Both are valid.

 I'll go with ""CLOUD"" because it has C and L which are common.

 So, the next guess: CLOUD.

 But note: we are not using any of the forbidden letters (R, E, A, S, T). So it's safe.

 Therefore, I choose ""CLOUD"".Based on the feedback for ""REAST"" (all letters marked as 'x'), none of the letters R, E, A, S, or T are in the secret word. For the next guess, I need to avoid these letters entirely and prioritize common English letters not yet tested, such as O, I, L, N, U, D, C, M, or P. The goal is to maximize new information by covering frequent consonants and vowels.

After evaluating options like ""POUND,"" ""BUILD,"" and ""DOING,"" I selected **""CLOUD""** because:
- It uses 5 new, common letters (C, L, O, U, D).
- It avoids redundant letters and excluded characters.
- It tests vowels (O, U) and frequent consonants (C, L, D) in varied positions.

<guess>CLOUD</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: REAST -> FEEDBACK: R(x) E(x) A(x) S(x) T(x)
Guess 2: CLOUD -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) O(x) U(-) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses so far:
1. REAST: all letters absent (R, E, A, S, T not in the word)
2. CLOUD: C, O, D absent; L and U present but in the wrong positions.

So, the secret word contains L and U, but not in the positions we guessed (position 2 and 4 respectively in ""CLOUD"").

Since L and U are present, we know:
- L is in the word, but not in the second position.
- U is in the word, but not in the fourth position.

Also, we know the word does not contain: R, E, A, S, T, C, O, D.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Includes L and U (since they are present, we should use them to find their correct positions)
- Avoids the absent letters: R, E, A, S, T, C, O, D.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

What letters are left? We have used: R,E,A,S,T,C,L,O,U,D.

Remaining letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know that L and U must be in the word, so we have to include them in the next guess, but in different positions.

Let's think about possible positions for L and U.

In ""CLOUD"", L was in position 2 and U in position 4. So for the next guess, we should try L in a different position (not 2) and U in a different position (not 4).

We also need to choose three other letters from the remaining set.

Common letters among the remaining: N, H, I, M, P, B, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Let's try to form a word that includes L and U, and three new common letters, and avoids the forbidden ones.

Possible words:

- We need L and U, and three from: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, etc.

Example: ""PLUMB"" -> but B is at the end? Let's check: P-L-U-M-B. But we have to avoid positions? We don't know the positions yet.

But note: we cannot use P? We haven't used P yet, so it's allowed.

But let's see if ""PLUMB"" is valid? It is a word (meaning to measure depth or to weight with lead).

But it has M and B, which are new.

However, we have to consider the positions: in ""CLOUD"", L was in position 2 and U in 4. Now in ""PLUMB"", L is in position 2 again? We know L is not in position 2, so we cannot put L in position 2. Similarly, U is in position 3, which is different from 4, so that's okay.

But in ""PLUMB"", L is in position 2, which we know is incorrect. So we must avoid putting L in position 2.

Therefore, we need a word where L is not in position 2 and U is not in position 4.

Let me try to think of words with L and U, avoiding positions 2 for L and 4 for U.

Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 4, 5
Possible positions for U: 1, 2, 3, 5

Also, the word must not contain R,E,A,S,T,C,O,D.

Let me list some candidate words:

- ""BLUFF"": B-L-U-F-F -> but has two F's? And F is new. But L is in position 2? We cannot have L in position 2. So invalid.

- ""FLUNG"": F-L-U-N-G -> L is in position 2 again? Not allowed.

- ""GLUED"": but E and D are forbidden (from first and second guess). E and D are out.

- ""PLUMY"": P-L-U-M-Y -> L in position 2? Not allowed.

- ""UNLIT"": U-N-L-I-T -> but T is forbidden (from first guess).

- ""BUILT"": B-U-I-L-T -> T forbidden.

- ""GUILD"": G-U-I-L-D -> D forbidden.

- ""QUILT"": Q-U-I-L-T -> T forbidden.

- ""MULCH"": M-U-L-C-H -> C forbidden.

- ""PULPY"": P-U-L-P-Y -> L is in position 3? That's okay (not 2). U is in position 2? That's okay (not 4). And positions: 1:P, 2:U, 3:L, 4:P, 5:Y. But it has two P's? That might not be ideal because we are trying to maximize information, but it's acceptable if the word is valid. Also, P is new, Y is new.

But we have two P's? That means we are testing P only once effectively. Also, we don't know if P is in the word or not.

But ""PULPY"" is a valid word (resembling pulp).

However, we are using two P's, which might not be efficient. Also, we are not testing other letters.

Alternative: ""HUMID"" -> H-U-M-I-D -> but D is forbidden.

""JUMBO"" -> J-U-M-B-O -> O is forbidden.

""LUMBI"" not a word.

""UNLID"" not a word.

""FLUID"": F-L-U-I-D -> D forbidden.

""GUILT"": T forbidden.

""BUYIN"": B-U-Y-I-N -> no L? We must include L because we know it's in the word.

We have to include both L and U.

Another idea: ""UNIFY"" -> U-N-I-F-Y -> no L.

""UNCLIP"" too long.

What about ""BLUEP""? Not a word.

""PLUCK"": P-L-U-C-K -> C forbidden.

""FLUKE"": F-L-U-K-E -> E forbidden.

""PLUMB"": as before, but L in position 2 not allowed.

We need to avoid position 2 for L.

So let's try to put L in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Position 1: L _ _ _ _

With U somewhere not 4.

For example: ""LUNCH"" -> L-U-N-C-H -> C forbidden.

""LURCH"" -> R and C forbidden.

""LUCKY"" -> C forbidden.

""LUMPS"" -> S forbidden.

""LUPUS"" -> S forbidden and two U's? L-U-P-U-S -> not 5 unique? But we can have repeated letters? The rules don't say we can't, but in Wordle, words can have repeated letters. However, in this case, we are trying to maximize information, so unique letters are better. Also, S is forbidden.

""LINGU"" not a word.

""LOGIN"" -> O and G? O is forbidden.

""LYNCH"" -> Y, N, C, H -> C forbidden.

""PILUM"" not a word.

""ULNAR"" -> R forbidden.

""ULCER"" -> R and C forbidden.

""ULTRA"" -> R and A forbidden.

This is getting difficult.

What about ""BLIMP"": B-L-I-M-P -> L is in position 2? Not allowed.

""GLYPH"": G-L-Y-P-H -> L in position 2? Not allowed.

We need to avoid L in position 2.

So let's try L in position 3: _ _ L _ _

With U in 1,2, or 5? (since not 4)

For example: ""PULPY"" we had, but with two P's.

Another: ""FULLY"" -> F-U-L-L-Y -> two L's? And U in position 2. But we have two L's, which is not ideal, but acceptable. Also, F and Y are new.

But we know L is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? It might, but we are not sure. So testing with two L's might not be efficient.

But let's see: ""FULLY"" is a valid word.

Positions: 1:F, 2:U, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y.

We know L is not in position 2 (from previous feedback), but it could be in 3 or 4? In this guess, we have L in 3 and 4. But we don't know which one is correct, or if both are? But the feedback will tell us.

But we are also using U in position 2, which is allowed (since previously U was in 4, not 2).

Another option: ""BULKY"" -> B-U-L-K-Y -> L in position 3? That's okay. U in position 2? Okay. And B, K, Y are new.

""BULKY"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""GULPY"" not a word.

""PULKA"" not a word.

""SULKY"" -> S forbidden.

So ""BULKY"" seems good: B, U, L, K, Y. All new except U and L.

Positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:L, 4:K, 5:Y.

We are putting U in position 2 (which is new) and L in position 3 (which is new, since previously L was in 2 and now 3).

Also, we are testing B, K, Y.

Another possibility: ""HULKY"" -> H-U-L-K-Y, similar.

But ""BULKY"" is more common.

We could put L in position 4.

For example: ""FUNKY"" -> F-U-N-K-Y -> no L? We must include L.

""PUNKY"" -> P-U-N-K-Y -> no L.

""BUNKO"" -> O forbidden.

""JUMBO"" -> O forbidden.

""DUMPY"" -> D forbidden.

""GUMPY"" not a word.

""LUMPY"" -> L-U-M-P-Y -> L in position 1? Then U in position 2. And M, P, Y new.

""LUMPY"": 1:L, 2:U, 3:M, 4:P, 5:Y.

But L is in position 1, which is new (previously was in 2). U in position 2, which is new (previously in 4). So that's good.

""LUMPY"" is a valid word (full of lumps).

Similarly, ""BUMPY"" -> B-U-M-P-Y -> same, but with B instead of L? But we need L. ""BUMPY"" has no L.

So ""LUMPY"" has L and U.

But in ""LUMPY"", L is in 1 and U in 2.

We could also have L in position 5: _ _ _ _ L

With U not in 4.

For example: ""PUDL"" not 5 letters.

""FUGAL"" -> F-U-G-A-L -> A forbidden.

""JUGAL"" -> J-U-G-A-L -> A forbidden.

""MANUL"" not common.

So ""LUMPY"" and ""BULKY"" are candidates.

Between ""BULKY"" and ""LUMPY"", which is better?

""BULKY"": tests B, U, L, K, Y. U in pos2, L in pos3.
""LUMPY"": tests L, U, M, P, Y. L in pos1, U in pos2.

Both avoid the forbidden letters and positions.

We also have to consider frequency of letters. B, K, Y vs M, P, Y.

M and P are more common than K and B? Let's see:

Common letters: M, P are more common than B and K? Actually, in English, P is more common than K and B? According to letter frequency:

E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... then C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, ...

So M is more common than P, B, K? M is 14th, P is 16th, B is 19th, K is 20th. So M and P are slightly more common than B and K.

But Y is the same in both.

Also, ""LUMPY"" has M and P, which might be more likely.

But we are also testing L in position 1 in ""LUMPY"", which we haven't tried before, and in ""BULKY"" L in position 3.

Similarly for U, both have U in position 2.

We don't have strong reason to prefer one over the other.

Another word: ""GULPH"" not common.

""WULIK"" not a word.

""BLUET"" T forbidden.

I think both ""BULKY"" and ""LUMPY"" are acceptable.

But let's consider that in ""CLOUD"", we had L absent in position 2 and U absent in position 4. Now, if we put U in position 2, it might be correct? We don't know.

Similarly, L in position 1 or 3 might be correct.

I'll go with ""BULKY"" because it has a good mix.

But we have another option: ""UNLID"" not a word.

""FLUID"" forbidden letters.

What about ""BUILD""? B-U-I-L-D -> D is forbidden (from second guess, D was absent).

D is out, so ""BUILD"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""GUILD"" has D.

""QUILL"" -> Q-U-I-L-L -> two L's, and Q is rare. Also, L in position 4? But we can try.

But two L's might not be ideal.

""QUILL"" has U in position 2 and L in position 4 and 5? Q-U-I-L-L, so L in 4 and 5.

But we don't know if L is repeated.

I think ""BULKY"" is better.

Another word: ""PULIK"" not a word.

""KULAK"" -> K-U-L-A-K -> A forbidden and two K's.

Not good.

So I think ""BULKY"" is a solid choice.

But let's confirm the letters: B, U, L, K, Y.

We haven't used B, K, Y before, and U and L are known to be present.

Also, positions: U in 2 (new position), L in 3 (new position).

So we can get information about U in 2 and L in 3, and also test B, K, Y.

Therefore, I'll go with ""BULKY"".Based on the feedback:
- ""REAST"" had all letters absent (R, E, A, S, T excluded).
- ""CLOUD"" had C, O, D absent (further excluding these) and L/U present but in wrong positions (L not in position 2, U not in position 4).

The secret word contains L and U, but not in the previous guessed positions. For the next guess:
- Must include L and U (to test new positions).
- Avoid excluded letters: R, E, A, S, T, C, O, D.
- Prioritize new common letters (e.g., B, K, Y) to maximize information.

- It includes L (position 3) and U (position 2), both in untested positions.
- It introduces new common letters: B, K, Y.

Since it\'s the first guess, we want a word that can provide maximum information.\n The ideal first guess should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize coverage.\n Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T, N).\n One classic starting word is ""CRANE"" because it contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R) and covers multiple common letters.\n Another good option is ""SLATE"". However, let me pick a word that I know is common and well-balanced.\n\n Let\'s choose ""ROATE"". This word is commonly used as it contains four common letters including vowels and consonants.\n However, note that the game requires valid English words. ""ROATE"" is valid? Actually, I think ""ROATE"" is less common. Let me think again.\n\n Instead, I\'ll go with ""CRANE"". It\'s a valid word and a popular starter.\n\n Guess: CRANE\n\n But note: the game does not require the word to be a common word? It just must be a valid English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.\n\n Therefore, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".I need to make the first guess in Wordle. Since this is the first attempt, I want a word that maximizes information by covering common English letters, including vowels and frequent consonants. The goal is to reveal as much about the secret word\'s structure as possible. I\'ll prioritize letters like R, S, T, L, N, E, A – which appear frequently in 5-letter words. A balanced word with minimal repeated letters is ideal for broad coverage.\n\nAfter considering options like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" and ""ROAST,"" I choose **""REAST""** (meaning to dry by exposure to heat or air). It includes two vowels (E, A) and three common consonants (R, S, T), while avoiding redundancy. This combination should give useful feedback across all positions.\n\n<guess>REAST</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: REAST -> FEEDBACK: R(x) E(x) A(x) S(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are starting with the first guess: REAST, and the feedback was all \'x\', meaning none of the letters R, E, A, S, T are in the secret word.\n Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.\n\n Since the first guess eliminated 5 common letters, we need to pick a new word that uses none of R, E, A, S, T.\n\n We have to choose from the remaining letters. We should aim for another set of common letters to maximize information.\n\n Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding R, E, A, S, T) might include: O, I, L, N, U, D, C, M, P, etc.\n\n We want a word that uses as many of the remaining common letters as possible and doesn\'t repeat letters.\n\n Let\'s consider some words:\n - Could use ""OUIJA"" but that has a J which is less common and also repeats? Actually, ""OUIJA"" is 5 letters but has a J and is not very common. Also, it has two I\'s? No, O-U-I-J-A: unique letters? O, U, I, J, A -> but A is already eliminated. We cannot use A.\n\n We cannot use A because it was in the first guess and was marked as not present.\n\n So, we must avoid: R, E, A, S, T.\n\n Let\'s think of words without these letters. Some possibilities:\n\n - ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D -> all new letters. This is a valid word.\n - ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D -> also valid and common.\n - ""MOUND"": M, O, U, N, D -> similar.\n\n But note: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common remaining letters might be O, I, L, N, U, D, C, M, P, H, etc.\n\n Another idea: ""CHINO"" (a type of cloth) -> C, H, I, N, O. But that\'s 5 letters? C-H-I-N-O? Actually, ""CHINO"" is 5 letters? Wait, it\'s 5: C-H-I-N-O.\n\n However, we might also consider ""LYNCH"" but that has Y and H which are less common.\n\n Alternatively, ""OILED"" has E which is eliminated? We cannot use E.\n\n We must avoid E as well.\n\n Let\'s list some words without R, E, A, S, T:\n\n - ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D\n - ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D\n - ""MOUND"": M, O, U, N, D\n - ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D\n - ""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D\n - ""CHILD"": C, H, I, L, D\n - ""WOUND"": W, O, U, N, D -> but W is less common.\n\n We also have to consider that we are in the second guess and we want to maximize the chance of hitting some letters.\n\n Another good one: ""DOING"" -> D, O, I, N, G -> but G is not extremely common, but acceptable.\n\n However, note that we have 6 tries, so we can afford to be systematic.\n\n I think ""POUND"" is a good candidate because it uses P, O, U, N, D which are fairly common and we haven\'t tried any of them.\n\n Alternatively, ""CLOUD"" is also good.\n\n But let me check: the word must be valid. Both are valid.\n\n I\'ll go with ""CLOUD"" because it has C and L which are common.\n\n So, the next guess: CLOUD.\n\n But note: we are not using any of the forbidden letters (R, E, A, S, T). So it\'s safe.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""CLOUD"".Based on the feedback for ""REAST"" (all letters marked as \'x\'), none of the letters R, E, A, S, or T are in the secret word. For the next guess, I need to avoid these letters entirely and prioritize common English letters not yet tested, such as O, I, L, N, U, D, C, M, or P. The goal is to maximize new information by covering frequent consonants and vowels.\n\nAfter evaluating options like ""POUND,"" ""BUILD,"" and ""DOING,"" I selected **""CLOUD""** because:\n- It uses 5 new, common letters (C, L, O, U, D).\n- It avoids redundant letters and excluded characters.\n- It tests vowels (O, U) and frequent consonants (C, L, D) in varied positions.\n\n<guess>CLOUD</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: REAST -> FEEDBACK: R(x) E(x) A(x) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 2: CLOUD -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) O(x) U(-) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses so far:\n1.

So for the next guess, we should try L in a different position (not 2) and U in a different position (not 4).\n\nWe also need to choose three other letters from the remaining set.\n\nCommon letters among the remaining: N, H, I, M, P, B, etc.\n\nWe should try to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\nLet\'s try to form a word that includes L and U, and three new common letters, and avoids the forbidden ones.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- We need L and U, and three from: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, etc.\n\nExample: ""PLUMB"" -> but B is at the end? Let\'s check: P-L-U-M-B. But we have to avoid positions? We don\'t know the positions yet.\n\nBut note: we cannot use P? We haven\'t used P yet, so it\'s allowed.\n\nBut let\'s see if ""PLUMB"" is valid? It is a word (meaning to measure depth or to weight with lead).\n\nBut it has M and B, which are new.\n\nHowever, we have to consider the positions: in ""CLOUD"", L was in position 2 and U in 4. Now in ""PLUMB"", L is in position 2 again? We know L is not in position 2, so we cannot put L in position 2. Similarly, U is in position 3, which is different from 4, so that\'s okay.\n\nBut in ""PLUMB"", L is in position 2, which we know is incorrect. So we must avoid putting L in position 2.\n\nTherefore, we need a word where L is not in position 2 and U is not in position 4.\n\nLet me try to think of words with L and U, avoiding positions 2 for L and 4 for U.\n\nPossible positions for L: 1, 3, 4, 5\nPossible positions for U: 1, 2, 3, 5\n\nAlso, the word must not contain R,E,A,S,T,C,O,D.\n\nLet me list some candidate words:\n\n- ""BLUFF"": B-L-U-F-F -> but has two F\'s? And F is new. But L is in position 2? We cannot have L in position 2. So invalid.\n\n- ""FLUNG"": F-L-U-N-G -> L is in position 2 again? Not allowed.\n\n- ""GLUED"": but E and D are forbidden (from first and second guess). E and D are out.\n\n- ""PLUMY"": P-L-U-M-Y -> L in position 2? Not allowed.\n\n- ""UNLIT"": U-N-L-I-T -> but T is forbidden (from first guess).\n\n- ""BUILT"": B-U-I-L-T -> T forbidden.\n\n- ""GUILD"": G-U-I-L-D -> D forbidden.\n\n- ""QUILT"": Q-U-I-L-T -> T forbidden.\n\n- ""MULCH"": M-U-L-C-H -> C forbidden.\n\n- ""PULPY"": P-U-L-P-Y -> L is in position 3? That\'s okay (not 2). U is in position 2? That\'s okay (not 4). And positions: 1:P, 2:U, 3:L, 4:P, 5:Y. But it has two P\'s? That might not be ideal because we are trying to maximize information, but it\'s acceptable if the word is valid. Also, P is new, Y is new.\n\nBut we have two P\'s? That means we are testing P only once effectively. Also, we don\'t know if P is in the word or not.\n\nBut ""PULPY"" is a valid word (resembling pulp).\n\nHowever, we are using two P\'s, which might not be efficient. Also, we are not testing other letters.\n\nAlternative: ""HUMID"" -> H-U-M-I-D -> but D is forbidden.\n\n""JUMBO"" -> J-U-M-B-O -> O is forbidden.\n\n""LUMBI"" not a word.\n\n""UNLID"" not a word.\n\n""FLUID"": F-L-U-I-D -> D forbidden.\n\n""GUILT"": T forbidden.\n\n""BUYIN"": B-U-Y-I-N -> no L?

Not a word.\n\n""PLUCK"": P-L-U-C-K -> C forbidden.\n\n""FLUKE"": F-L-U-K-E -> E forbidden.\n\n""PLUMB"": as before, but L in position 2 not allowed.\n\nWe need to avoid position 2 for L.\n\nSo let\'s try to put L in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nPosition 1: L _ _ _ _\n\nWith U somewhere not 4.\n\nFor example: ""LUNCH"" -> L-U-N-C-H -> C forbidden.\n\n""LURCH"" -> R and C forbidden.\n\n""LUCKY"" -> C forbidden.\n\n""LUMPS"" -> S forbidden.\n\n""LUPUS"" -> S forbidden and two U\'s? L-U-P-U-S -> not 5 unique? But we can have repeated letters? The rules don\'t say we can\'t, but in Wordle, words can have repeated letters. However, in this case, we are trying to maximize information, so unique letters are better. Also, S is forbidden.\n\n""LINGU"" not a word.\n\n""LOGIN"" -> O and G? O is forbidden.\n\n""LYNCH"" -> Y, N, C, H -> C forbidden.\n\n""PILUM"" not a word.\n\n""ULNAR"" -> R forbidden.\n\n""ULCER"" -> R and C forbidden.\n\n""ULTRA"" -> R and A forbidden.\n\nThis is getting difficult.\n\nWhat about ""BLIMP"": B-L-I-M-P -> L is in position 2? Not allowed.\n\n""GLYPH"": G-L-Y-P-H -> L in position 2? Not allowed.\n\nWe need to avoid L in position 2.\n\nSo let\'s try L in position 3: _ _ L _ _\n\nWith U in 1,2, or 5? (since not 4)\n\nFor example: ""PULPY"" we had, but with two P\'s.\n\nAnother: ""FULLY"" -> F-U-L-L-Y -> two L\'s? And U in position 2. But we have two L\'s, which is not ideal, but acceptable. Also, F and Y are new.\n\nBut we know L is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice? It might, but we are not sure. So testing with two L\'s might not be efficient.\n\nBut let\'s see: ""FULLY"" is a valid word.\n\nPositions: 1:F, 2:U, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y.\n\nWe know L is not in position 2 (from previous feedback), but it could be in 3 or 4? In this guess, we have L in 3 and 4. But we don\'t know which one is correct, or if both are? But the feedback will tell us.\n\nBut we are also using U in position 2, which is allowed (since previously U was in 4, not 2).\n\nAnother option: ""BULKY"" -> B-U-L-K-Y -> L in position 3? That\'s okay. U in position 2? Okay. And B, K, Y are new.\n\n""BULKY"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""GULPY"" not a word.\n\n""PULKA"" not a word.\n\n""SULKY"" -> S forbidden.\n\nSo ""BULKY"" seems good: B, U, L, K, Y. All new except U and L.\n\nPositions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:L, 4:K, 5:Y.\n\nWe are putting U in position 2 (which is new) and L in position 3 (which is new, since previously L was in 2 and now 3).\n\nAlso, we are testing B, K, Y.\n\nAnother possibility: ""HULKY"" -> H-U-L-K-Y, similar.\n\nBut ""BULKY"" is more common.\n\nWe could put L in position 4.\n\nFor example: ""FUNKY"" -> F-U-N-K-Y -> no L? We must include L.\n\n""PUNKY"" -> P-U-N-K-Y -> no L.\n\n""BUNKO"" -> O forbidden.\n\n""JUMBO"" -> O forbidden.\n\n""DUMPY"" -> D forbidden.\n\n""GUMPY"" not a word.\n\n""LUMPY"" -> L-U-M-P-Y -> L in position 1? Then U in position 2. And M, P, Y new.\n\n""LUMPY"": 1:L, 2:U, 3:M, 4:P, 5:Y.\n\nBut L is in position 1, which is new (previously was in 2). U in position 2, which is new (previously in 4). So that\'s good.\n\n""LUMPY"" is a valid word (full of lumps).\n\nSimilarly, ""BUMPY"" -> B-U-M-P-Y -> same, but with B instead of L? But we need L. ""BUMPY"" has no L.\n\nSo ""LUMPY"" has L and U.\n\nBut in ""LUMPY"", L is in 1 and U in 2.\n\nWe could also have L in position 5: _ _ _ _ L\n\nWith U not in 4.\n\nFor example: ""PUDL"" not 5 letters.\n\n""FUGAL"" -> F-U-G-A-L -> A forbidden.\n\n""JUGAL"" -> J-U-G-A-L -> A forbidden.\n\n""MANUL"" not common.\n\nSo ""LUMPY"" and ""BULKY"" are candidates.\n\nBetween ""BULKY"" and ""LUMPY"", which is better?\n\n""BULKY"": tests B, U, L, K, Y. U in pos2, L in pos3.\n""LUMPY"": tests L, U, M, P, Y. L in pos1, U in pos2.\n\nBoth avoid the forbidden letters and positions.\n\nWe also have to consider frequency of letters. B, K, Y vs M, P, Y.\n\nM and P are more common than K and B? Let\'s see:\n\nCommon letters: M, P are more common than B and K? Actually, in English, P is more common than K and B? According to letter frequency:\n\nE, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... then C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, ...\n\nSo M is more common than P, B, K? M is 14th, P is 16th, B is 19th, K is 20th. So M and P are slightly more common than B and K.\n\nBut Y is the same in both.\n\nAlso, ""LUMPY"" has M and P, which might be more likely.\n\nBut we are also testing L in position 1 in ""LUMPY"", which we haven\'t tried before, and in ""BULKY"" L in position 3.\n\nSimilarly for U, both have U in position 2.\n\nWe don\'t have strong reason to prefer one over the other.\n\nAnother word: ""GULPH"" not common.\n\n""WULIK"" not a word.\n\n""BLUET"" T forbidden.\n\nI think both ""BULKY"" and ""LUMPY"" are acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s consider that in ""CLOUD"", we had L absent in position 2 and U absent in position 4. Now, if we put U in position 2, it might be correct? We don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly, L in position 1 or 3 might be correct.\n\nI\'ll go with ""BULKY"" because it has a good mix.\n\nBut we have another option: ""UNLID"" not a word.\n\n""FLUID"" forbidden letters.\n\nWhat about ""BUILD""? B-U-I-L-D -> D is forbidden (from second guess, D was absent).\n\nD is out, so ""BUILD"" is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""GUILD"" has D.\n\n""QUILL"" -> Q-U-I-L-L -> two L\'s, and Q is rare. Also, L in position 4? But we can try.\n\nBut two L\'s might not be ideal.\n\n""QUILL"" has U in position 2 and L in position 4 and 5? Q-U-I-L-L, so L in 4 and 5.\n\nBut we don\'t know if L is repeated.\n\nI think ""BULKY"" is better.\n\nAnother word: ""PULIK"" not a word.\n\n""KULAK"" -> K-U-L-A-K -> A forbidden and two K\'s.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo I think ""BULKY"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters: B, U, L, K, Y.\n\nWe haven\'t used B, K, Y before, and U and L are known to be present.\n\nAlso, positions: U in 2 (new position), L in 3 (new position).\n\nSo we can get information about U in 2 and L in 3, and also test B, K, Y.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""BULKY"".Based on the feedback:\n- ""REAST"" had all letters absent (R, E, A, S, T excluded).\n- ""CLOUD"" had C, O, D absent (further excluding these) and L/U present but in wrong positions (L not in position 2, U not in position 4).\n\nThe secret word contains L and U, but not in the previous guessed positions. For the next guess:\n- Must include L and U (to test new positions).\n- Avoid excluded letters: R, E, A, S, T, C, O, D.\n- Prioritize new common letters (e.g., B, K, Y) to maximize information.\n- Test L in a new position (not 2) and U in a new position (not 4).\n\nAfter evaluating options like ""LUMPY"" and ""BULKY,"" I chose **""BULKY""** because:\n- It includes L (position 3) and U (position 2), both in untested positions.\n- It introduces new common letters: B, K, Y.\n- It avoids redundant letters and all excluded characters.\n\n<guess>BULKY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: REAST -> FEEDBACK: R(x) E(x) A(x) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 2: CLOUD -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) O(x) U(-) D(x)\nGuess 3: BULKY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) L(✓) K(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for three guesses:
1. REAST: All letters (R, E, A, S, T) are absent (x), so they are not in the secret word.
2. CLOUD: C, O, D absent (x); L and U are present but in wrong positions (-). Specifically, L was in position 2 and U in position 4, so neither is in the correct position for the secret word.
3. BULKY: B and K absent (x); U, L, Y present and all in the correct positions (✓). The feedback says: B(x) U(✓) L(✓) K(x) Y(✓). This means that in the secret word:
   - U is in position 2 (because in BULKY, U is the second letter and it's marked ✓)
   - L is in position 3 (because L is the third letter and marked ✓)
   - Y is in position 5 (because Y is the fifth letter and marked ✓)

So the secret word has:
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: L
- Position 5: Y

And we know that positions 1 and 4 are missing.

From the feedback, we also know the word contains U, L, Y and does not contain: R, E, A, S, T, C, O, D, B, K.

Moreover, from guess 2 (CLOUD), we know that L cannot be in position 2 and U cannot be in position 4, which is consistent since now we have U in 2 (correct) and L in 3 (correct), so that matches.

So the secret word looks like: ? U L ? Y

We need to find the first and fourth letters. They cannot be any of the excluded letters: R, E, A, S, T, C, O, D, B, K.

We also know from guess 1 and 2 that the word does not have any of those excluded letters.

Now, we must pick a word that fits: ? U L ? Y, and the missing letters (position 1 and 4) must be from the remaining letters. We have used: R, E, A, S, T, C, O, D, B, K, U, L, Y.

So available letters: F, G, H, I, J, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and note that U, L, Y are already placed, so we are only choosing for positions 1 and 4).

We need to pick two letters to fill positions 1 and 4. We must form a valid 5-letter English word.

Possible words matching ?UL?Y:

- We can try common letters: G, H, M, N, P, etc.

Consider:
- GULFY? Not a word.
- GULLY -> but we have U, then L, then L? But the pattern is ? U L ? Y. So fourth letter must be a single letter. ""GULLY"" would be G U L L Y. That is, position 4 is L. But that means the word has two L's? However, we don't know if L can be repeated? But the feedback for BULKY had L in position 3 and correct, but we don't have information about another L.

But let's think: the word must be ? U L ? Y. If we put L in position 4, then the word would be ? U L L Y, which is ""GULLY"" or ""NULLY"" (not a word) or ""BULLY"" but B is excluded? B is excluded from guess 3.

From guess 3, B is absent so cannot be in the word. So ""BULLY"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""GULLY"" is a valid word: G U L L Y.

But is L repeated? Yes. And we have L in position 3 already marked correct. So if we try ""GULLY"", then position 4 is L, which is a repeat. Is that allowed? The rules don't prohibit repeated letters. However, in the feedback of previous guesses, when we had ""CLOUD"" we did not get two L's? No, because we only guessed one L. Similarly, in ""BULKY"" we had one L.

So we cannot rule out that L might be repeated? But the feedback for BULKY had L correct in position 3, so at least one L is there. Could there be two? Possibly.

But let me check in ""GULLY"": 
- G in pos1, U in pos2, first L in pos3, second L in pos4, Y in pos5.
But in our pattern, we have U in 2 (fixed), L in 3 (fixed), Y in 5 (fixed). The first L is in position 3, and we are putting another L in position 4? It might be acceptable.

However, we have already established that position 3 is L, so if we try ""GULLY"", then the L in position 4 is an additional L.

But the question is, can we use a repeated L? Yes, if it is in the word.

But we don't know from previous guesses if there is a second L? We have not tested any word with two L's, so we don't know.

Other possibilities: what are other words?

- HULKY? But that's not matching because we have Y in 5, so ? U L ? Y. ""HULKY"" would be H U L K Y, but K is excluded? And we have position 4 as K, but K is absent from guess 3? In guess 3 (BULKY), K is absent, so K cannot be in the word. So ""HULKY"" is invalid.

Similarly, we need a word with ? U L ? Y, and without the excluded letters.

Possible words:

- ""GULFY"" not a word.
- ""HULKY"" not a word and K excluded.
- ""MULCHY"" too long.
- ""PULPY"": P U L P Y -> but this would be P in position1, U in2, L in3, P in4, Y in5. P is not excluded? And it's a valid word (resembling pulp). But we have two P's? In ""PULPY"", we have P in position1 and P in position4? So repeated P? That might be acceptable.

But let me check excluded letters: R, E, A, S, T, C, O, D, B, K. P is not excluded.

So ""PULPY"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""FULGY"" not a word.

""JUMBY"" not a word.

""NUMPY"" not a word.

So candidates so far: ""GULLY"" and ""PULPY"".

But ""GULLY"" uses G and L (and L repeated), and ""PULPY"" uses P and P repeated.

Now, are there words without repetition? For example:

- ""FUNLY"" not a word.
- ""HUNLY"" not a word.
- ""MUGLY"" not a word.
- ""PUGGY"" not a word.
- ""WULFY"" not a word.
- ""ZULFY"" not a word.
- ""FUMFY"" no.

Perhaps ""JUMPS"" but S is excluded.

""NIFLY"" not a word.

What about ""DULY""? But that's 4 letters.

We need 5 letters.

Another candidate: ""NULLY"" not a word.

""PALLY"" -> but A is excluded? A is in the excluded list from guess 1? Yes, A is excluded.

What about ""PULPY""? Or ""GULLY"".

But let me list standard words.

Another common one: ""GULPH"" -> but that's G U L P H, but then Y? No, we have Y in position 5.

Perhaps ""WIMPY"" but W I M P Y -> I in position 2? But we need U in position 2, not I. The U is fixed in position2.

Unless? But the feedback says U is in position2 and correct.

So position2 is U.

So we must have U in position2.

Similarly, only position1 and 4 are missing.

So let me search a vocabulary:

Words ending with ...UL.Y? For example:
- Beautiful? Too long.
- Also, the structure ? U L ? Y.

Possible:
- GULLY: G U L L Y
- PULPY: P U L P Y
- FILLY: but I in position2, not U.

Also, ""MULCH"" doesn't end with Y.

""HULKY"" has K excluded.

Perhaps ""CULMY"" not a word.

Another one: ""DELAY"" but E and A excluded and D excluded? And structure not match.

We might have to consider that the letter in position4 could be a vowel? But we have to work with the constraints.

Perhaps ""BULKY"" we tried, but that had K and B, excluded.

Another word: ""PULIS"" S excluded.

Why not try ""GULPY""? Not a common word? Gulpy is an adjective meaning like gulping, but it might be accepted? However, Wordle word list might not include it.

Similarly, ""JULEY"" not a word.

I think ""GULLY"" and ""PULPY"" are the most likely.

But we have another candidate: ""LOUSY"" -> L O U S Y, but O and S are excluded? O is excluded from guess2, and S from guess1? And also, the pattern: position2 is U? In ""LOUSY"", position2 is O, not U? No, L O U S Y has O in pos2? But we need U in pos2.

Incorrect structure.

What about ""FUSSY"" -> F U S S Y, but S excluded? And position3 is S? But we need L in position3.

Not matching.

But we know position3 is L? From the feedback? Yes, because in BULKY, L is position3 and it's a match? And Y in position5 match, so position3 is L? But the secret word must have L in position3? Absolutely? Because the feedback for L was ✓ and it was in position3? So it must be that L is there at position3.

Similarly, position2 and5 are fixed as U and Y.

So only position1 and4 to guess.

Now, let's see feedback:

From guess2, we had L marked wrong position? But that was in position2? Now we know it is in position3? Correct? Yes.

Similarly, U was in position4 in guess2 but absent? Actually, in guess2 (CLOUD), U was marked with (-) meaning it is in the word but not in position4? And now we know it is in position2? So that's consistent.

Now, for the next guess, we can try to fill positions1 and4? We know the secret word must be ? U L ? Y.

We can guess a word that fits this pattern? But we also need to test for other letters? Since we have only two positions, and we have eliminated many letters, we might guess the word correctly.

But we still have two positions? With the constraints.

Since we know the positions exactly for U, L, Y, we only need to find the letter at position1 and position4.

But note: it could be the same letter? Like in ""GULLY"" or ""PULPY"".

We could also have different letters? For example, ""GULFY"" not a word.

Other possibilities? What about ""GUSHY""? But S excluded and H? Position4 is H? But then the word is G U L H Y? No, that would be G U L H Y? But ""GULHY"" is not a word? Actually, ""GUSH"" is a word but it ends with H? Not Y.

Perhaps ""MULSH"" not a word.

The only common words fitting ?UL?Y are ""GULLY"" and ""PULPY"".

But is there ""FULLY""? F U L L Y? But that has position3 as L and position4 as L? So it matches F U L L Y? And positions:1:F,2:U,3:L,4:L,5:Y. So it would have two L's? Yes, which is possible. And we haven't excluded F? F is not used yet? So F is available.

But in ""FULLY"", we have L in position3 (which is fixed) and L in position4? So the word is ""FULLY"".

But ""FULLY"" is a valid word.

So now candidates: ""FULLY"", ""GULLY"", ""PULPY"".

All have repeated letters? ""FULLY"" has two L's, ""GULLY"" has two L's, ""PULPY"" has two P's.

But we don't care? Because the word can have repeated letters.

We need to test? We have two guesses left? But we might be able to guess correctly.

But note: we don't know which one it is? So we have several options.

But we can try one that covers new letters? We have F, G, P available? We haven't tested F, G, P.

If we guess ""FULLY"", then we test F and L (again) but we already know L is there? We might get feedback that helps.

Similarly, if we guess ""GULLY"", we test G and L again.

But we are constrained by the pattern? Actually, any guess we make must match the pattern ? U L ? Y? Because we know U, L, Y at positions 2,3,5.

But we could use a word that doesn't have extra to test? But since we only have two positions, we can make a direct guess? But we don't know between multiple options.

So we must pick one? But to be safe, we should pick a word that tests different letters? We have many options? But actually, the most common ones are ""FULLY"", ""GULLY"", ""PULPY"", and perhaps ""JUMBY"" not valid.

Another less common: ""HUSKY"" but S and K excluded? Not possible.

""DUCHY"" D excluded.

""LUMMY"" not a word.

""MUMMY"" but then U M M Y? Not matching.

So I think the possibilities are:
- FULLY: F U L L Y
- GULLY: G U L L Y
- PULPY: P U L P Y

We could also have ""NURDY"" not a word.

But to decide, we can see which one we want to test? We haven't tested F, G, P? So we can test F by guessing ""FULLY"", or G by guessing ""GULLY"", or P by guessing ""PULPY"".

But since we are running out of guesses? We have only 3 left? No, we have done 3 guesses? So we have up to 3 more guesses? But we are not in a hurry? And we can probably deduce if we get feedback.

But to maximize information? But the pattern is fixed? So the feedback will tell us about the positions? In fact, for such a constrained pattern, we might guess correctly.

But let me think: if we guess ""FULLY"", and the secret word is ""GULLY"", then the feedback might not be efficient? However, we get immediate information.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests one candidate, and if wrong, we know to try the next.

But we have multiple candidates? So we need to prioritize.

We might also miss that the letter in position4 is a new letter? But in all these cases, position4 is either L or P? In ""PULPY"" it is P? And in ""FULLY"" and ""GULLY"" it is L? So we have two types: one where position4 is L and the word has repeated L, or ""PULPY"" which has P in position1 and4.

But ""PULPY"" is different: positions:1:P,2:U,3:L,4:P,5:Y? So position1 and4 are both P.

While ""GULLY"":1:G,2:U,3:L,4:L,5:Y? So for position1: G, position4: L.

Similarly for ""FULLY"": F, then L.

So the only candidate with position4 being L is ""GULLY"" and ""FULLY""? And ""PULPY"" has position4 as P.

We don't know what letter is in position1? It could be different? But we have three distinct patterns? And we need to choose one.

But note: in ""GULLY"" and ""FULLY"", position4 is L, which we already know is present? But we are verifying if it is repeated? Whereas in ""PULPY"", position4 is P, which is new.

We might guess ""GULPY"" but it's not a valid word? So not.

Another candidate? Is ""HULPY"" a word? Not common.

So among the valid words, let's pick one that uses a common letter.

I'll go with ""GULLY"" because it's a very common word? And often used.

Perhaps ""FULLY"" is also common.

But if we guess ""GULLY"", and the secret word is ""GULLY"", we win? Or if not, we get feedback.

Similarly, if we guess ""GULLY"", and the secret word is ""PULPY"", then the feedback would be:
- G in position1: absent? Because PULPY has P there? So it would be G (x), U (✓), L (✓), L in position4? But we guessed L in position4? If the secret word is PULPY, then position4 is P, not L? So L is already accounted for? We have L in position3? So in the secret word PULPY, it has L at position3? And no other L? So when we guess GULLY, we have:

Position1: G -> not in word? PULPY has no G? So x.
Position2: U -> correct? ✓
Position3: in GULLY, we have L at position3? And it should match? ✓
Position4: in GULLY we have L? But in PULPY, position4 is P? So we are testing L at position4, which is not present? And since we already have one L in position3, and no other L? So the second L should be marked? What happened to the second L? In Wordle, if the secret word has one L and we guess two L's, the second L would be marked as not in the word? Or absent? But only for extra letters? Let's see:

Actually, in the rules: each letter is marked independently? But a letter appearing in the word more than once is handled? Typically, if the secret word has a letter once, and you guess it in two positions: one that matches gets ✓, and the other gets marked as absent? Or based on presence?

For example: secret word is ""AABBC"", guess ""AABCD"": then first A correct? Then second A? The secret has another A? Or not? It depends.

In PULPY: the letters are P, U, L, P, Y? So two P's? And one L.

If we guess GULLY: G, U, L, L, Y.

Feedback:
- Position1: G ? not in secret? x
- Position2: U? correct? ✓
- Position3: L? correct? ✓
- Position4: L? But secret has only one L? And it is already used in position3? So no extra L? Therefore, the L at position4 would be marked as absent? But also position4 in secret is P? It doesn't match? So we mark as x? But only? Or if the letter is present? But it is present, but not here? That's minus? Or absent?

Let's recall the rules:
- ✓: correct letter and correct position.
- -: letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
- x: letter is not in the word.

For guess GULLY vs secret PULPY:
- Position1: G -> not in secret? x
- Position2: U -> in correct position? ✓
- Position3: L -> in correct position? ✓
- Position4: L -> but there is no second L? So L is in the word, but only one copy? And we already accounted for that at position3? So the letter L is present, but it is already matched? So we cannot mark it as present again? Therefore, it should be marked as absent? So x? But for clarity, the symbol for fourth L would be x because the secret doesn't have another L.

So fourth L: x
- Position5: Y? correct? ✓

So feedback: G(x) U(✓) L(✓) L(x) Y(✓)

Similarly, if the secret is ""FULLY"", then guess ""GULLY"":
Position1: G vs F? G is absent? x
Position4: the first L is at position3? And second L at position4? But ""FULLY"" has L at position3 and4? So both are L? Therefore:
Position1: G? x
Position2: U? ✓
Position3: L? ✓
Position4: L? for ""FULLY"", position4 is L, so correct? So ✓
Position5: Y? ✓
So G(x) U(✓) L(✓) L(✓) Y(✓)? But we have two L's, both present and correct.

But this would solve.

However, if we pick ""GULLY"", and it is correct, we win? Or if it is ""PULPY"", we get feedback showing L at position4 as absent? Then we would know it's not GULLY or FULLY? Then we'd go to PULPY.

Similarly, if we see two ✓ for L in a guess that has two L's, we would know.

But for now, I think ""GULLY"" is a common word? I'll go with that.

Alternatively, to avoid repetition, we could try a word with different letters? But there are no other common words? ""SULPH"" not ending with Y.

So I choose ""GULLY"".

But let's think strategy? We might also consider that position1 and4 could be different letters? For example, is there a word like ""H U L M Y""? Not a word.

Or ""N U L I Y"" not a word.

""P U L V Y"" not common.

So I think ""GULLY"", ""PULPY"", and ""FULLY"" are the main options.

To test with less repetition? Or to maximize new letters? We can pick ""PULPY"" because it tests P? Which we haven't tested.

Similarly, ""FULLY"" tests F.

But ""GULLY"" tests G.

We haven't tested any of F,G,P.

We can also consider that in previous guesses, we haven't tried words with repetition? But Wordle allows repetitions? So it's fine.

I think ""GULLY"" is a reasonable guess.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have repetition? But it might not exist? Like ""QUIPY"" not a word.

So I'll go with ""GULLY"".

Therefore, the guess is ""GULLY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (REAST)**: All letters (R, E, A, S, T) are absent (x), excluding them from the secret word.
- **Guess 2 (CLOUD)**: C, O, D absent (x); L and U are present but wrong positions (-), revealing L cannot be in position 2 and U cannot be in position 4.
- **Guess 3 (BULKY)**: B and K absent (x); U, L, and Y are present and correct (✓), confirming:
  - U is in position 2.
  - L is in position 3.
  - Y is in position 5.

The secret word structure is: **? U L ? Y**  
Excluded letters: R, E, A, S, T, C, O, D, B, K.  
Remaining letters to test: F, G, H, I, J, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  

Possible valid words fitting **? U L ? Y** include:
- **GULLY**: G U L L Y
- **PULPY**: P U L P Y
- **FULLY**: F U L L Y

All candidates have repeated letters (L or P repetitions). ""GULLY"" prioritizes testing G, a common unused letter. This guess could validate the word or provide critical feedback on position 1 and the fourth letter.

<guess>GULLY</guess>",GULLY,"We are given feedback for three guesses:
1. REAST: All letters (R, E, A, S, T) are absent (x), so they are not in the secret word.
2. CLOUD: C, O, D absent (x); L and U are present but in wrong positions (-). Specifically, L was in position 2 and U in position 4, so neither is in the correct position for the secret word.
3. BULKY: B and K absent (x); U, L, Y present and all in the correct positions (✓). The feedback says: B(x) U(✓) L(✓) K(x) Y(✓). This means that in the secret word:
   - U is in position 2 (because in BULKY, U is the second letter and it's marked ✓)
   - L is in position 3 (because L is the third letter and marked ✓)
   - Y is in position 5 (because Y is the fifth letter and marked ✓)

So the secret word has:
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: L
- Position 5: Y

And we know that positions 1 and 4 are missing.

From the feedback, we also know the word contains U, L, Y and does not contain: R, E, A, S, T, C, O, D, B, K.

Moreover, from guess 2 (CLOUD), we know that L cannot be in position 2 and U cannot be in position 4, which is consistent since now we have U in 2 (correct) and L in 3 (correct), so that matches.

So the secret word looks like: ? U L ? Y

We need to find the first and fourth letters. They cannot be any of the excluded letters: R, E, A, S, T, C, O, D, B, K.

We also know from guess 1 and 2 that the word does not have any of those excluded letters.

Now, we must pick a word that fits: ? U L ? Y, and the missing letters (position 1 and 4) must be from the remaining letters. We have used: R, E, A, S, T, C, O, D, B, K, U, L, Y.

So available letters: F, G, H, I, J, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and note that U, L, Y are already placed, so we are only choosing for positions 1 and 4).

We need to pick two letters to fill positions 1 and 4. We must form a valid 5-letter English word.

Possible words matching ?UL?Y:

- We can try common letters: G, H, M, N, P, etc.

Consider:
- GULFY? Not a word.
- GULLY -> but we have U, then L, then L? But the pattern is ? U L ? Y. So fourth letter must be a single letter. ""GULLY"" would be G U L L Y. That is, position 4 is L. But that means the word has two L's? However, we don't know if L can be repeated? But the feedback for BULKY had L in position 3 and correct, but we don't have information about another L.

But let's think: the word must be ? U L ? Y. If we put L in position 4, then the word would be ? U L L Y, which is ""GULLY"" or ""NULLY"" (not a word) or ""BULLY"" but B is excluded? B is excluded from guess 3.

From guess 3, B is absent so cannot be in the word. So ""BULLY"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""GULLY"" is a valid word: G U L L Y.

But is L repeated? Yes. And we have L in position 3 already marked correct. So if we try ""GULLY"", then position 4 is L, which is a repeat. Is that allowed? The rules don't prohibit repeated letters. However, in the feedback of previous guesses, when we had ""CLOUD"" we did not get two L's? No, because we only guessed one L. Similarly, in ""BULKY"" we had one L.

So we cannot rule out that L might be repeated? But the feedback for BULKY had L correct in position 3, so at least one L is there. Could there be two? Possibly.

But let me check in ""GULLY"": 
- G in pos1, U in pos2, first L in pos3, second L in pos4, Y in pos5.
But in our pattern, we have U in 2 (fixed), L in 3 (fixed), Y in 5 (fixed). The first L is in position 3, and we are putting another L in position 4? It might be acceptable.

However, we have already established that position 3 is L, so if we try ""GULLY"", then the L in position 4 is an additional L.

But the question is, can we use a repeated L? Yes, if it is in the word.

But we don't know from previous guesses if there is a second L? We have not tested any word with two L's, so we don't know.

Other possibilities: what are other words?

- HULKY? But that's not matching because we have Y in 5, so ? U L ? Y. ""HULKY"" would be H U L K Y, but K is excluded? And we have position 4 as K, but K is absent from guess 3? In guess 3 (BULKY), K is absent, so K cannot be in the word. So ""HULKY"" is invalid.

Similarly, we need a word with ? U L ? Y, and without the excluded letters.

Possible words:

- ""GULFY"" not a word.
- ""HULKY"" not a word and K excluded.
- ""MULCHY"" too long.
- ""PULPY"": P U L P Y -> but this would be P in position1, U in2, L in3, P in4, Y in5. P is not excluded? And it's a valid word (resembling pulp). But we have two P's? In ""PULPY"", we have P in position1 and P in position4? So repeated P? That might be acceptable.

But let me check excluded letters: R, E, A, S, T, C, O, D, B, K. P is not excluded.

So ""PULPY"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""FULGY"" not a word.

""JUMBY"" not a word.

""NUMPY"" not a word.

So candidates so far: ""GULLY"" and ""PULPY"".

But ""GULLY"" uses G and L (and L repeated), and ""PULPY"" uses P and P repeated.

Now, are there words without repetition? For example:

- ""FUNLY"" not a word.
- ""HUNLY"" not a word.
- ""MUGLY"" not a word.
- ""PUGGY"" not a word.
- ""WULFY"" not a word.
- ""ZULFY"" not a word.
- ""FUMFY"" no.

Perhaps ""JUMPS"" but S is excluded.

""NIFLY"" not a word.

What about ""DULY""? But that's 4 letters.

We need 5 letters.

Another candidate: ""NULLY"" not a word.

""PALLY"" -> but A is excluded? A is in the excluded list from guess 1? Yes, A is excluded.

What about ""PULPY""? Or ""GULLY"".

But let me list standard words.

Another common one: ""GULPH"" -> but that's G U L P H, but then Y? No, we have Y in position 5.

Perhaps ""WIMPY"" but W I M P Y -> I in position 2? But we need U in position 2, not I. The U is fixed in position2.

Unless? But the feedback says U is in position2 and correct.

So position2 is U.

So we must have U in position2.

Similarly, only position1 and 4 are missing.

So let me search a vocabulary:

Words ending with ...UL.Y? For example:
- Beautiful? Too long.
- Also, the structure ? U L ? Y.

Possible:
- GULLY: G U L L Y
- PULPY: P U L P Y
- FILLY: but I in position2, not U.

Also, ""MULCH"" doesn't end with Y.

""HULKY"" has K excluded.

Perhaps ""CULMY"" not a word.

Another one: ""DELAY"" but E and A excluded and D excluded? And structure not match.

We might have to consider that the letter in position4 could be a vowel? But we have to work with the constraints.

Perhaps ""BULKY"" we tried, but that had K and B, excluded.

Another word: ""PULIS"" S excluded.

Why not try ""GULPY""? Not a common word? Gulpy is an adjective meaning like gulping, but it might be accepted? However, Wordle word list might not include it.

Similarly, ""JULEY"" not a word.

I think ""GULLY"" and ""PULPY"" are the most likely.

But we have another candidate: ""LOUSY"" -> L O U S Y, but O and S are excluded? O is excluded from guess2, and S from guess1? And also, the pattern: position2 is U? In ""LOUSY"", position2 is O, not U? No, L O U S Y has O in pos2? But we need U in pos2.

Incorrect structure.

What about ""FUSSY"" -> F U S S Y, but S excluded? And position3 is S? But we need L in position3.

Not matching.

But we know position3 is L? From the feedback? Yes, because in BULKY, L is position3 and it's a match? And Y in position5 match, so position3 is L? But the secret word must have L in position3? Absolutely? Because the feedback for L was ✓ and it was in position3? So it must be that L is there at position3.

Similarly, position2 and5 are fixed as U and Y.

So only position1 and4 to guess.

Now, let's see feedback:

From guess2, we had L marked wrong position? But that was in position2? Now we know it is in position3? Correct? Yes.

Similarly, U was in position4 in guess2 but absent? Actually, in guess2 (CLOUD), U was marked with (-) meaning it is in the word but not in position4? And now we know it is in position2? So that's consistent.

Now, for the next guess, we can try to fill positions1 and4? We know the secret word must be ? U L ? Y.

We can guess a word that fits this pattern? But we also need to test for other letters? Since we have only two positions, and we have eliminated many letters, we might guess the word correctly.

But we still have two positions? With the constraints.

Since we know the positions exactly for U, L, Y, we only need to find the letter at position1 and position4.

But note: it could be the same letter? Like in ""GULLY"" or ""PULPY"".

We could also have different letters? For example, ""GULFY"" not a word.

Other possibilities? What about ""GUSHY""? But S excluded and H? Position4 is H? But then the word is G U L H Y? No, that would be G U L H Y? But ""GULHY"" is not a word? Actually, ""GUSH"" is a word but it ends with H? Not Y.

Perhaps ""MULSH"" not a word.

The only common words fitting ?UL?Y are ""GULLY"" and ""PULPY"".

But is there ""FULLY""? F U L L Y? But that has position3 as L and position4 as L? So it matches F U L L Y? And positions:1:F,2:U,3:L,4:L,5:Y. So it would have two L's? Yes, which is possible. And we haven't excluded F? F is not used yet? So F is available.

But in ""FULLY"", we have L in position3 (which is fixed) and L in position4? So the word is ""FULLY"".

But ""FULLY"" is a valid word.

So now candidates: ""FULLY"", ""GULLY"", ""PULPY"".

All have repeated letters? ""FULLY"" has two L's, ""GULLY"" has two L's, ""PULPY"" has two P's.

But we don't care? Because the word can have repeated letters.

We need to test? We have two guesses left? But we might be able to guess correctly.

But note: we don't know which one it is? So we have several options.

But we can try one that covers new letters? We have F, G, P available? We haven't tested F, G, P.

If we guess ""FULLY"", then we test F and L (again) but we already know L is there? We might get feedback that helps.

Similarly, if we guess ""GULLY"", we test G and L again.

But we are constrained by the pattern? Actually, any guess we make must match the pattern ? U L ? Y? Because we know U, L, Y at positions 2,3,5.

But we could use a word that doesn't have extra to test? But since we only have two positions, we can make a direct guess? But we don't know between multiple options.

So we must pick one? But to be safe, we should pick a word that tests different letters? We have many options? But actually, the most common ones are ""FULLY"", ""GULLY"", ""PULPY"", and perhaps ""JUMBY"" not valid.

Another less common: ""HUSKY"" but S and K excluded? Not possible.

""DUCHY"" D excluded.

""LUMMY"" not a word.

""MUMMY"" but then U M M Y? Not matching.

So I think the possibilities are:
- FULLY: F U L L Y
- GULLY: G U L L Y
- PULPY: P U L P Y

We could also have ""NURDY"" not a word.

But to decide, we can see which one we want to test? We haven't tested F, G, P? So we can test F by guessing ""FULLY"", or G by guessing ""GULLY"", or P by guessing ""PULPY"".

But since we are running out of guesses? We have only 3 left? No, we have done 3 guesses? So we have up to 3 more guesses? But we are not in a hurry? And we can probably deduce if we get feedback.

But to maximize information? But the pattern is fixed? So the feedback will tell us about the positions? In fact, for such a constrained pattern, we might guess correctly.

But let me think: if we guess ""FULLY"", and the secret word is ""GULLY"", then the feedback might not be efficient? However, we get immediate information.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests one candidate, and if wrong, we know to try the next.

But we have multiple candidates? So we need to prioritize.

We might also miss that the letter in position4 is a new letter? But in all these cases, position4 is either L or P? In ""PULPY"" it is P? And in ""FULLY"" and ""GULLY"" it is L? So we have two types: one where position4 is L and the word has repeated L, or ""PULPY"" which has P in position1 and4.

But ""PULPY"" is different: positions:1:P,2:U,3:L,4:P,5:Y? So position1 and4 are both P.

While ""GULLY"":1:G,2:U,3:L,4:L,5:Y? So for position1: G, position4: L.

Similarly for ""FULLY"": F, then L.

So the only candidate with position4 being L is ""GULLY"" and ""FULLY""? And ""PULPY"" has position4 as P.

We don't know what letter is in position1? It could be different? But we have three distinct patterns? And we need to choose one.

But note: in ""GULLY"" and ""FULLY"", position4 is L, which we already know is present? But we are verifying if it is repeated? Whereas in ""PULPY"", position4 is P, which is new.

We might guess ""GULPY"" but it's not a valid word? So not.

Another candidate? Is ""HULPY"" a word? Not common.

So among the valid words, let's pick one that uses a common letter.

I'll go with ""GULLY"" because it's a very common word? And often used.

Perhaps ""FULLY"" is also common.

But if we guess ""GULLY"", and the secret word is ""GULLY"", we win? Or if not, we get feedback.

Similarly, if we guess ""GULLY"", and the secret word is ""PULPY"", then the feedback would be:
- G in position1: absent? Because PULPY has P there? So it would be G (x), U (✓), L (✓), L in position4? But we guessed L in position4? If the secret word is PULPY, then position4 is P, not L? So L is already accounted for? We have L in position3? So in the secret word PULPY, it has L at position3? And no other L? So when we guess GULLY, we have:

Position1: G -> not in word? PULPY has no G? So x.
Position2: U -> correct? ✓
Position3: in GULLY, we have L at position3? And it should match? ✓
Position4: in GULLY we have L? But in PULPY, position4 is P? So we are testing L at position4, which is not present? And since we already have one L in position3, and no other L? So the second L should be marked? What happened to the second L? In Wordle, if the secret word has one L and we guess two L's, the second L would be marked as not in the word? Or absent? But only for extra letters? Let's see:

Actually, in the rules: each letter is marked independently? But a letter appearing in the word more than once is handled? Typically, if the secret word has a letter once, and you guess it in two positions: one that matches gets ✓, and the other gets marked as absent? Or based on presence?

For example: secret word is ""AABBC"", guess ""AABCD"": then first A correct? Then second A? The secret has another A? Or not? It depends.

In PULPY: the letters are P, U, L, P, Y? So two P's? And one L.

If we guess GULLY: G, U, L, L, Y.

Feedback:
- Position1: G ? not in secret? x
- Position2: U? correct? ✓
- Position3: L? correct? ✓
- Position4: L? But secret has only one L? And it is already used in position3? So no extra L? Therefore, the L at position4 would be marked as absent? But also position4 in secret is P? It doesn't match? So we mark as x? But only? Or if the letter is present? But it is present, but not here? That's minus? Or absent?

Let's recall the rules:
- ✓: correct letter and correct position.
- -: letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
- x: letter is not in the word.

For guess GULLY vs secret PULPY:
- Position1: G -> not in secret? x
- Position2: U -> in correct position? ✓
- Position3: L -> in correct position? ✓
- Position4: L -> but there is no second L? So L is in the word, but only one copy? And we already accounted for that at position3? So the letter L is present, but it is already matched? So we cannot mark it as present again? Therefore, it should be marked as absent? So x? But for clarity, the symbol for fourth L would be x because the secret doesn't have another L.

So fourth L: x
- Position5: Y? correct? ✓

So feedback: G(x) U(✓) L(✓) L(x) Y(✓)

Similarly, if the secret is ""FULLY"", then guess ""GULLY"":
Position1: G vs F? G is absent? x
Position4: the first L is at position3? And second L at position4? But ""FULLY"" has L at position3 and4? So both are L? Therefore:
Position1: G? x
Position2: U? ✓
Position3: L? ✓
Position4: L? for ""FULLY"", position4 is L, so correct? So ✓
Position5: Y? ✓
So G(x) U(✓) L(✓) L(✓) Y(✓)? But we have two L's, both present and correct.

But this would solve.

However, if we pick ""GULLY"", and it is correct, we win? Or if it is ""PULPY"", we get feedback showing L at position4 as absent? Then we would know it's not GULLY or FULLY? Then we'd go to PULPY.

Similarly, if we see two ✓ for L in a guess that has two L's, we would know.

But for now, I think ""GULLY"" is a common word? I'll go with that.

Alternatively, to avoid repetition, we could try a word with different letters? But there are no other common words? ""SULPH"" not ending with Y.

So I choose ""GULLY"".

But let's think strategy? We might also consider that position1 and4 could be different letters? For example, is there a word like ""H U L M Y""? Not a word.

Or ""N U L I Y"" not a word.

""P U L V Y"" not common.

So I think ""GULLY"", ""PULPY"", and ""FULLY"" are the main options.

To test with less repetition? Or to maximize new letters? We can pick ""PULPY"" because it tests P? Which we haven't tested.

Similarly, ""FULLY"" tests F.

But ""GULLY"" tests G.

We haven't tested any of F,G,P.

We can also consider that in previous guesses, we haven't tried words with repetition? But Wordle allows repetitions? So it's fine.

I think ""GULLY"" is a reasonable guess.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have repetition? But it might not exist? Like ""QUIPY"" not a word.

So I'll go with ""GULLY"".

Therefore, the guess is ""GULLY"".Based on the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (REAST)**: All letters (R, E, A, S, T) are absent (x), excluding them from the secret word.
- **Guess 2 (CLOUD)**: C, O, D absent (x); L and U are present but wrong positions (-), revealing L cannot be in position 2 and U cannot be in position 4.
- **Guess 3 (BULKY)**: B and K absent (x); U, L, and Y are present and correct (✓), confirming:
  - U is in position 2.
  - L is in position 3.
  - Y is in position 5.

The secret word structure is: **? U L ? Y**  
Excluded letters: R, E, A, S, T, C, O, D, B, K.  
Remaining letters to test: F, G, H, I, J, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  

Possible valid words fitting **? U L ? Y** include:
- **GULLY**: G U L L Y
- **PULPY**: P U L P Y
- **FULLY**: F U L L Y

All candidates have repeated letters (L or P repetitions). ""GULLY"" prioritizes testing G, a common unused letter. This guess could validate the word or provide critical feedback on position 1 and the fourth letter.",Guess 4: GULLY -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) U(✓) L(✓) L(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
