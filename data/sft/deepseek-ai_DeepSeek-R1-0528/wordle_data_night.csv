We are making the first guess without any prior feedback. It's generally a good strategy to start with a word that has common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 A popular starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". Alternatively, ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word meaning the accumulated earnings of an investment) is also used for its letter frequency.

 However, since we need to stick to more common words, let's choose ""SLATE"". It has 'S', 'L', 'A', 'T', 'E' which are common.

 So, the first guess is ""SLATE"".

We are given feedback on the first guess ""SLATE"": 
 S(x) -> S is not in the secret word.
 L(x) -> L is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 T(-) -> T is in the word but in the wrong position.
 E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

 Therefore, we know:
 - The letter T is present in the secret word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""SLATE"", T is the 4th letter and it's marked as '-', meaning wrong position).
 - Letters S, L, A, E are absent.

 Since T is present but not in position 4, it must be in one of the positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 For the next guess, we should avoid using S, L, A, E and include T in a different position. Also, we should choose a word that has other common letters to maximize information.

 Let's think of common letters that haven't been tested yet. We haven't tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Given that T is in the word, we can try a word that has T in one of the positions that are not 4: so position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 We also note that the secret word does not contain: S, L, A, E.

 We need a word that has T and four other letters from the remaining set.

 Since T was in position 4 in the first guess and that was wrong, let's try moving T to a different position.

 One common strategy is to try T at the beginning or the end.

 Also, we want to cover multiple common letters. Let me pick a word that has T and some vowels we haven't tried yet (like O, I, U) and common consonants.

 But note: we haven't tried O, I, U? Well, we tried A and E, so vowels left are O, I, U. We might want to test one or two of them.

 However, since we only have 5 letters, let's try a word that includes T and other common consonants and maybe one vowel (O or I).

 Example: let's try ""POINT"". But note: we are avoiding S,L,A,E. P,O,I,N,T: none of the forbidden letters. But wait, we don't know if O, I, N are in the word.

 Alternatively, we might also consider ""TROUT"", ""GROUT"", etc. Sometimes people use ""TRUTH"", but that has T at position 1 and H at the end.

 However, note that the feedback for T was in position 4: but now we are moving it. Since we must have T somewhere else, let me try putting T in position 1.

 Possible words: ""TRUTH"" (but it has T at the beginning and end? Actually, that's okay because T might be repeated? But the feedback doesn't tell us about multiple letters unless we guess multiple. The rules: each letter is marked independently. But note: if the word has two T's, then if we guess one T correctly and one incorrectly, we might see two markings. But in ""SLATE"", we only had one T and it was marked present but wrong position.

 Actually, the secret word might have only one T? Or two? We don't know. We should avoid assuming duplicates until we have evidence.

 Since we don't have information on duplicates, we can try a word that has T only once? Or we can try a word that might have duplicate T? It doesn't matter as long as we cover new letters.

 However, to maximize new information, perhaps we avoid duplicate letters for now.

 So, let me choose a word that has T and no other forbidden letters, and T in position 1.

 Common words: ""TIGER"", but we have to check letters: T, I, G, E, R -> E is forbidden? Yes, E was absent in the first guess, so we shouldn't use E. So skip.

 Another word: ""TOUCH"" -> T,O,U,C,H -> none forbidden? Yes, because forbidden are S,L,A,E. So okay.

 But what about ""TRAIN""? T,R,A,I,N -> A is forbidden? Yes, because A was absent. So we cannot use A.

 How about ""POINT"" again? P,O,I,N,T. T is at the end (position 5). That's acceptable.

 Or ""TRUNK"": T,R,U,N,K -> no forbidden letters.

 Let me think: I want to test new vowels? We haven't tested O or I or U. 

 We could try ""POINT"" or ""JOINT"" or ""MOIST"". But note: ""MOIST"" has S? But S is forbidden? Yes, so we cannot use S. So ""MOIST"" is invalid because of S? Actually, no: in the feedback, S was absent so we must avoid S. Similarly for other forbidden letters.

 So possible words: 
 - ""CRONY"": C,R,O,N,Y -> but no T? We must include T because we know it's in the word. So we must use T.

 Therefore, we need a word that includes T and avoids S,L,A,E.

 Let me list: 
   Option 1: T at the beginning: ""T"" _ _ _ _
   Option 2: T at the end: _ _ _ _ ""T""

 We also want to cover as many high-frequency letters as possible.

 Consider ""TOUCH"" (T,O,U,C,H) -> not very common letters except T and H? 
 Or ""TRUNK"" (T,R,U,N,K) -> letters R,U,N,K.

 Another option: ""POINT"" (P,O,I,N,T) -> T at the end. This covers O, I, N, P.

 Also, ""POINT"" is a common word.

 Alternatively, ""PRINT"" (P,R,I,N,T) -> R and I and N.

 Or ""DRINK"" doesn't have T? 

 Since T must be included, I like ""POINT"" because it uses common letters and T is in position 5 (which is a new position).

 We know T wasn't in position 4 last time. Now we test position 5? Also, we test O, I, N, P.

 So let's choose ""POINT"".

 Alternatively, we could try ""TIGER"" but E is forbidden -> invalid.

 Or ""TOUGH"": T,O,U,G,H -> acceptable? But we have U and G? 

 But note: we have limited guesses. We also want to get as much information as possible.

 Since we have no information on vowels except A and E are out, we can test O and I in ""POINT"". 

 Therefore, I'll go with ""POINT"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""SLATE"":
- S, L, A, E are **absent** from the secret word.
- T is **present** but **not in position 4** (since it was marked as ""-"").

For the next guess:
- **Must include T** in a new position (not position 4) to confirm its location.
- **Avoid letters S, L, A, E** entirely.
- Test new common vowels/consonants (e.g., O, I, N, P) to gather more information.

After analyzing viable words, ""POINT"" is selected because:
- Places T in position 5 (a new location).
- Uses high-frequency letters (P, O, I, N) not yet tested.
- Avoids forbidden letters (S, L, A, E).

 Or ""TOUGH"": T,O,U,G,H -> acceptable? But we have U and G? 

 But note: we have limited guesses. We also want to get as much information as possible.

 Since we have no information on vowels except A and E are out, we can test O and I in ""POINT"". 

 Therefore, I'll go with ""POINT"".

<guess>POINT</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""SLATE"":
- S, L, A, E are **absent** from the secret word.
- T is **present** but **not in position 4** (since it was marked as ""-"").

For the next guess:
- **Must include T** in a new position (not position 4) to confirm its location.
- **Avoid letters S, L, A, E** entirely.
- Test new common vowels/consonants (e.g., O, I, N, P) to gather more information.

After analyzing viable words, ""POINT"" is selected because:
- Places T in position 5 (a new location).
- Uses high-frequency letters (P, O, I, N) not yet tested.
- Avoids forbidden letters (S, L, A, E).

It\'s generally a good strategy to start with a word that has common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants.\n Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U\n Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.\n\n A popular starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". Alternatively, ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word meaning the accumulated earnings of an investment) is also used for its letter frequency.\n\n However, since we need to stick to more common words, let\'s choose ""SLATE"". It has \'S\', \'L\', \'A\', \'T\', \'E\' which are common.\n\n So, the first guess is ""SLATE"".\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on the first guess ""SLATE"": \n S(x) -> S is not in the secret word.\n L(x) -> L is not in the secret word.\n A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.\n T(-) -> T is in the word but in the wrong position.\n E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.\n\n Therefore, we know:\n - The letter T is present in the secret word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""SLATE"", T is the 4th letter and it\'s marked as \'-\', meaning wrong position).\n - Letters S, L, A, E are absent.\n\n Since T is present but not in position 4, it must be in one of the positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\n For the next guess, we should avoid using S, L, A, E and include T in a different position. Also, we should choose a word that has other common letters to maximize information.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that haven\'t been tested yet. We haven\'t tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n Given that T is in the word, we can try a word that has T in one of the positions that are not 4: so position 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\n We also note that the secret word does not contain: S, L, A, E.\n\n We need a word that has T and four other letters from the remaining set.\n\n Since T was in position 4 in the first guess and that was wrong, let\'s try moving T to a different position.\n\n One common strategy is to try T at the beginning or the end.\n\n Also, we want to cover multiple common letters. Let me pick a word that has T and some vowels we haven\'t tried yet (like O, I, U) and common consonants.\n\n But note: we haven\'t tried O, I, U? Well, we tried A and E, so vowels left are O, I, U. We might want to test one or two of them.\n\n However, since we only have 5 letters, let\'s try a word that includes T and other common consonants and maybe one vowel (O or I).\n\n Example: let\'s try ""POINT"". But note: we are avoiding S,L,A,E. P,O,I,N,T: none of the forbidden letters. But wait, we don\'t know if O, I, N are in the word.\n\n Alternatively, we might also consider ""TROUT"", ""GROUT"", etc. Sometimes people use ""TRUTH"", but that has T at position 1 and H at the end.\n\n However, note that the feedback for T was in position 4: but now we are moving it. Since we must have T somewhere else, let me try putting T in position 1.\n\n Possible words: ""TRUTH"" (but it has T at the beginning and end? Actually, that\'s okay because T might be repeated? But the feedback doesn\'t tell us about multiple letters unless we guess multiple. The rules: each letter is marked independently. But note: if the word has two T\'s, then if we guess one T correctly and one incorrectly, we might see two markings. But in ""SLATE"", we only had one T and it was marked present but wrong position.\n\n Actually, the secret word might have only one T? Or two? We don\'t know. We should avoid assuming duplicates until we have evidence.\n\n Since we don\'t have information on duplicates, we can try a word that has T only once? Or we can try a word that might have duplicate T? It doesn\'t matter as long as we cover new letters.\n\n However, to maximize new information, perhaps we avoid duplicate letters for now.\n\n So, let me choose a word that has T and no other forbidden letters, and T in position 1.\n\n Common words: ""TIGER"", but we have to check letters: T, I, G, E, R -> E is forbidden? Yes, E was absent in the first guess, so we shouldn\'t use E. So skip.\n\n Another word: ""TOUCH"" -> T,O,U,C,H -> none forbidden? Yes, because forbidden are S,L,A,E. So okay.\n\n But what about ""TRAIN""? T,R,A,I,N -> A is forbidden? Yes, because A was absent. So we cannot use A.\n\n How about ""POINT"" again? P,O,I,N,T. T is at the end (position 5). That\'s acceptable.\n\n Or ""TRUNK"": T,R,U,N,K -> no forbidden letters.\n\n Let me think: I want to test new vowels? We haven\'t tested O or I or U. \n\n We could try ""POINT"" or ""JOINT"" or ""MOIST"". But note: ""MOIST"" has S? But S is forbidden? Yes, so we cannot use S. So ""MOIST"" is invalid because of S? Actually, no: in the feedback, S was absent so we must avoid S. Similarly for other forbidden letters.\n\n So possible words: \n - ""CRONY"": C,R,O,N,Y -> but no T? We must include T because we know it\'s in the word. So we must use T.\n\n Therefore, we need a word that includes T and avoids S,L,A,E.\n\n Let me list: \n   Option 1: T at the beginning: ""T"" _ _ _ _\n   Option 2: T at the end: _ _ _ _ ""T""\n\n We also want to cover as many high-frequency letters as possible.\n\n Consider ""TOUCH"" (T,O,U,C,H) -> not very common letters except T and H? \n Or ""TRUNK"" (T,R,U,N,K) -> letters R,U,N,K.\n\n Another option: ""POINT"" (P,O,I,N,T) -> T at the end. This covers O, I, N, P.\n\n Also, ""POINT"" is a common word.\n\n Alternatively, ""PRINT"" (P,R,I,N,T) -> R and I and N.\n\n Or ""DRINK"" doesn\'t have T? \n\n Since T must be included, I like ""POINT"" because it uses common letters and T is in position 5 (which is a new position).\n\n We know T wasn\'t in position 4 last time. Now we test position 5? Also, we test O, I, N, P.\n\n So let\'s choose ""POINT"".\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""TIGER"" but E is forbidden -> invalid.\n\n Or ""TOUGH"": T,O,U,G,H -> acceptable?

We are given the following feedback:

Guess 1: SLATE -> Feedback: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
Meaning: 
- S, L, A, E are not in the word at all.
- T is in the word, but not in position 4 (where we guessed it).

Guess 2: POINT -> Feedback: P(x) O(x) I(-) N(-) T(✓)
Meaning:
- P and O are not in the word at all.
- I is in the word, but not in position 3 (where we guessed it).
- N is in the word, but not in position 4 (where we guessed it).
- T is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 5.

So, from the feedback, we know:

1. The secret word contains T, I, and N (since I and N are marked as present).
2. T is at position 5 (because we got a ✓ for T in position 5).
3. I is in the word but not at position 3.
4. N is in the word but not at position 4.
5. We also know the following letters are absent: S, L, A, E, P, O.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have T at position 5: _ _ _ _ T
- Contains I and N, but not in positions 3 or 4 respectively? Actually, note:
  - In POINT, I was at position 3 and marked as wrong position. So I cannot be at position 3, but could be elsewhere.
  - Similarly, N was at position 4 and marked as wrong position, so N cannot be at position 4.

Also, we know the word is 5 letters, and we have 3 known letters: T (position 5), I (somewhere but not position 3), and N (somewhere but not position 4).

We need to find a word that fits.

The positions:
We have positions 1, 2, and 3 open for I and N (and other letters) but note that I cannot be at position 3 and N cannot be at position 4. Since position 5 is taken by T, position 4 is still available? However, N cannot be at position 4? Actually, position 4 is still free? Yes because we haven't tested N in position 4 again? No, the feedback only says that in guess 2, N was at position 4 and that was the wrong position. But it doesn't mean N couldn't be elsewhere? We know N is in the word, but we don't know where it is exactly.

But from guess 2, we ruled out position 4 for N? Actually, the rule: a '-' for N at position 4 means that the letter N is in the word but not in that specific position. So N is in the word, but not at position 4.

Similarly, I is in the word, but not at position 3.

Now, considering the structure: _ _ _ _ T

We have I and N to place in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4? But note:
- Position 4: We cannot put N there? So N must be in position 1, 2, or 3? Because position 4 is forbidden for N? But wait, position 4 is available? Just that in this guess, when we put N at position 4 it was wrong. So we can place N in position 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4). Similarly, I can be in position 1, 2, or 4? But not position 3.

Also, we must note that the word might have more letters? We only know 3 letters: T, I, N.

So, we need a word that has at least T, I, N. And we know 5 letters total? So two more letters.

But we have two more slots to fill? Because we have positions 1,2,3 and 4? Actually, position 5 is T, so positions 1-4 must be filled with other letters including I and N? But note, exactly: the word must contain I and N, and then two other letters that we haven't eliminated.

We have eliminated: S, L, A, E, P, O. So we avoid those.

So available letters: all except S,L,A,E,P,O.

Now, since T is fixed at position 5, we have positions 1,2,3,4 to place I and N and two other letters.

Constraints:
- I cannot be at position 3? Actually, from POINT we got I(-) at position 3, so I is not at position 3? Therefore I must be at position 1,2, or 4.
- N cannot be at position 4? Therefore N must be at position 1,2, or 3.

But note: if we put I at position 1, then N would have to be at position 2 or 3? Then the other positions? Similarly, if I is at position 2, then N at position 1 or 3? Etc.

We need to find a word pattern: _ _ _ _ T, and must contain I and N, and two other letters that are not S,L,A,E,P,O.

Also, we have to consider: the word might have duplicate letters? But so far we don't have evidence of duplicates? Let's assume no duplicates for now to simplify.

Now, let's think of common words ending with T and containing I and N.

For example, words that end with T: think of common words.

Possible: ""PAINT"" -> but P is forbidden and A is forbidden? So invalid.

""JOINT"" -> J is not eliminated, O is forbidden? O we know is absent (from POINT: O was marked x). So cannot use JOINT.

""MINTY""? M,I,N,T,Y -> T is at position 4? But we need T at position 5. So ""MINTY"" is MINTY, so T at position 4? We need T at position 5. So words ending in T.

What about ""FRUIT""? F,R,U,I,T -> positions: F(1), R(2), R? Actually, U(3), I(4), T(5). So T at position 5. Now, check the forbidden letters: F, R, U, I are not forbidden? Forbidden are S,L,A,E,P,O. So FRUIT uses F,R,U,I,T -> okay? But note: we have I at position 4? And in this word, we have I and N? Wait, FRUIT does not have N? That's a problem. We know the word must contain N? Because from POINT, we had N marked as present. So FRUIT doesn't have N -> invalid.

We need a word that contains both I and N? And ends in T.

What about ""POINT"" again? We already tried that? And got feedback: so we cannot reuse without reason.

Another word: ""PRINT"" -> P,R,I,N,T -> ends with T. But P is absent? From Guess2: P(x) so P is absent? Therefore PRINT has P -> forbidden. So invalid.

""QUINT"" -> Q,U,I,N,T -> ends with T. Q is not forbidden? And U: we haven't tested U. But is Q common? Not really? Also, let's see the positions: 
In QUINT: Q(1), U(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> but in Guess2 we tried POINT: at position 3 we had I and it was marked as present but wrong position? And at position 4 we had N and wrong position. But note: in QUINT, I is at position 3? But from Guess2, we know I cannot be at position 3? Because we had I(-) in position 3 meaning that position is not I? So if QUINT has I at position 3, it would be invalid? Therefore QUINT cannot be the word? Actually, because I cannot be at position 3? So QUINT would be disallowed.

Another word: ""FLINT"" -> F,L,I,N,T -> L is forbidden? From Guess1: L(x) -> L is absent? So FLINT has L -> invalid.

""COUNT"" -> C,O,U,N,T -> O is absent? From Guess2: O(x) -> forbidden? Invalid.

""VAUNT"" -> V,A,U,N,T -> A forbidden? Invalid.

""HAUNT"" -> H,A,U,N,T -> A forbidden? Invalid.

""GRANT"" -> G,R,A,N,T -> A forbidden? Invalid.

What about ""BENCH"" -> doesn't end with T and no I?

We need to include I and N? Or wait, what letters must be in? We know I and N are in the word? Yes? So we must use both.

Also, avoid forbidden letters: S,L,A,E,P,O.

Another idea: ""MINTS"" -> but ends with S? Not T? And S forbidden? Also, duplicate T? No, MINT with S? No.

Perhaps ""MIGHT"" -> no N? 

""LIGHT"" -> contains L? Forbidden.

""FIGHT"" -> no N? 

""NIGHT"" -> N,I,G,H,T -> ends with T? Yes, T at position 5? So N,I,G,H,T. Check forbidden letters: none are forbidden? Because forbidden are S,L,A,E,P,O. So letters N,I,G,H are okay? 

In NIGHT: 
- Position 1: N
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: G
- Position 4: H
- Position 5: T

Now, check if this fits the constraints:
1. T is at position 5: correct.
2. I is present and in the word? Here at position 2.
   - Previously, we only knew that I could not be at position 3? Now we are putting it at position 2: that's allowed? Because position 3 was ruled out? 
   - Similarly, N is at position 1? Previously, we knew N could not be at position 4? Position 1 is allowed.

Now, what about the previous clue: 
In Guess2: POINT, we had N at position 4? Which was marked wrong? So if we put N at position 1, that would be okay? Similarly, I at position 2? Was that tried? No, POINT had I at position 3? So we haven't tried I at position 2? So this is a new position for I.

Therefore, ""NIGHT"" seems like a candidate? But let's verify with the feedback we have?

Also, we haven't tested G and H? So we might get additional information? But the word NIGHT ends with T? And has I and N? 

But wait: we don't know if G and H are in? But they could be? Or not? 

Another candidate: ""RIGHT"", but R is not forbidden? And we have R? Then R,I,G,H,T? Similarly.

But note: we don't know about R? We haven't tested R? In fact, we haven't tested many letters.

But we need to choose a word that uses only available letters? And fits the known facts.

Now, comparing ""NIGHT"" and other words? Also, ""TIGHT""? But T is already at the end? And we need T only at position 5? Also, TIGHT has T at the beginning? But that would be the same T? The word only has one T? But the secret word might have only one T? Because we had only one T marked present? Anyway, we don't know.

But ""NIGHT"" doesn't duplicate T? And starts with N? 

However, in Guess2 (POINT), we had N at position 4 and it was marked as present? But in NIGHT, N is now at position 1? So that's consistent? Because position 4 was wrong, so it can be at position 1? Similarly, I was at position 3? and now would be at position 2? 

So NIGHT appears to be valid? 

But wait, is G and H tested? We don't know? We need to guess? 

Alternatively, we might choose a word that includes letters we haven't tested? But we only have two unknowns? Actually, we have two slots? Or three because? Wait: the word has 5 letters: 
Positions: 1,2,3,4: which must include the letters I and N? And two others? So yes.

In NIGHT, the two others are G and H? We haven't tested them, so it's good? We might get more information? 

But we have only 4 guesses left? We should use a word that maximizes information? Possibly? 

How about a word that has more common letters? But common letters: since we've tested a few? 

Another candidate: ""DWELT""? But D,W,E,L,T -> E and L are forbidden? Invalid.

""UNIFY""? Doesn't end in T? 

Also, we must remember that the secret word contains I and N? Because of the feedback? So we must have both? 

Therefore, ""NIGHT"" seems a reasonable guess? 

Alternatively, ""POINT"" was already guessed? So we don't guess that again? 

Another word: ""QUILT""? But in QUILT? Q,U,I,L,T -> L forbidden? Invalid.

""SKINT""? S forbidden? 

What about ""SPENT""? S and E forbidden? 

Another candidate: ""BIRTH"" -> B,I,R,T,H -> but T is at position 4? We need T at position 5? So no.

We need words ending with T and containing I and N? 

With the constraints: I not at position 3, N not at position 4? 

Common words: ""STINT"": but S forbidden? 

""JOINT"": O forbidden? 

""FAINT"": A forbidden? 

Actually, it's harder? 

But note: we might have also tried ""HAINT""? Not a common word? And A forbidden? 

""POINT"" is already tried? 

So perhaps ""NIGHT"" is a good candidate? 

But wait: ""NIGHT"" has I at position 2? And N at position 1? 

Now, we also need to check: are there any conflicts? 

For position 1? We don't have any feedback? Position 2? Same? 

Therefore, I think we should go with ""NIGHT"". 

To confirm: 
If the word is NIGHT? Then the previous feedback: 
Guess1: SLATE -> T is present? But in NIGHT, T is at position 5? And position 4 was wrong? So in SLATE, T was at position 4? And then moved? So it's consistent? 

Guess2: POINT -> 
In POINT: P(absent), O(absent), I present? In NIGHT, I is at position 2? So not at position 3? So that's why I(-). Similarly, N is at position 1? Not at position 4? So N(-) and T correct at position 5? So it matches? 

Therefore, NIGHT is plausible? But we don't know? But it fits the constraints? 

Therefore, we guess ""NIGHT""? 

Alternatively, we might consider ""MIGHT""? M,I,G,H,T? Same? M is not forbidden? 

But M is also common? We don't have information on M? 

Similarly, H? 

But both are untested? 

But NIGHT starts with N? Which we know is present? And in this case, position 1 might be N? 

Similarly, we could try ""TWIST""? But T at the beginning? And W,I,S,T? S forbidden? So invalid? 

No? 

Another candidate: ""FRUIT"" doesn't have N? 

Then ""BEGIN"" -> doesn't end with T? 

So I think ""NIGHT"" is the best? 

But note: we haven't tested G and H? So if NIGHT is wrong, we get information on G and H? 

So, let's proceed with ""NIGHT"". 

If we get it wrong, we'll know about G and H? 

Another option: we might try a word with letters that are very common? And includes I and N? And ends with T? And avoids the known absent letters? 

For example, ""WINCE"" -> no T? 

""BOUND"" -> no T? 

Actually, another word: ""WRIST"" -> has S? 

""DAINT"" -> not valid? 

So I think ""NIGHT"" is fine? 

But wait: what about ""DINET""? Not valid? 

""PINTO"" -> no T? 

So maybe we go with NIGHT? 

So our next guess: ""NIGHT"" 

But also, we must be cautious: the word might have duplicate letters? For example, maybe the word is ""MINTS""? But S forbidden? 

So I think no? 

Conclusion: let's guess ""NIGHT"". 

So response format: 

<guess>NIGHT</guess> 

But note: we must only return the word? 

But let me double-check: 
- Secret word must end with T? Yes? 
- Must contain I and N? Yes? 
- With I not at position 3? In NIGHT, I is at position 2? So not 3? 
- N not at position 4? In NIGHT, N is at position 1? So not 4? 
- Also, no forbidden letters: N,I,G,H,T -> none of S,L,A,E,P,O? 
- G and H are not eliminated? 

So yes? 

Therefore, our next guess: NIGHT
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

**Feedback Summary:**
- S, L, A, E, P, O are **absent**.
- T is **present** and in the **correct position (5)**: i.e., the word ends with T.
- I is **present** but **not in position 3**.
- N is **present** but **not in position 4**.

**Conclusions:**
- The secret word ends with T: `_ _ _ _ T`.
- It contains I and N.
- I cannot be in position 3 (tried in POINT).
- N cannot be in position 4 (tried in POINT).
- Avoid eliminated letters: S, L, A, E, P, O.

**Strategy for Next Guess:**
- Place T in position 5 (known).
- Position I in a new location (not position 3), so options are 1, 2, or 4.
- Position N in a new location (not position 4), so options are 1, 2, or 3.
- Test new common consonants (e.g., G, H) to gather additional information.

After evaluating possible words that fit these constraints (e.g., ends with T, includes I and N, avoids eliminated letters), ""NIGHT"" is a valid candidate. It:
- Places I in position 2 (new position).
- Places N in position 1 (new position).
- Avoids eliminated letters.
- Introduces untested letters G and H for more feedback.

<guess>NIGHT</guess>",NIGHT,"We are given the following feedback:

Guess 1: SLATE -> Feedback: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
Meaning: 
- S, L, A, E are not in the word at all.
- T is in the word, but not in position 4 (where we guessed it).

Guess 2: POINT -> Feedback: P(x) O(x) I(-) N(-) T(✓)
Meaning:
- P and O are not in the word at all.
- I is in the word, but not in position 3 (where we guessed it).
- N is in the word, but not in position 4 (where we guessed it).
- T is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 5.

So, from the feedback, we know:

1. The secret word contains T, I, and N (since I and N are marked as present).
2. T is at position 5 (because we got a ✓ for T in position 5).
3. I is in the word but not at position 3.
4. N is in the word but not at position 4.
5. We also know the following letters are absent: S, L, A, E, P, O.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have T at position 5: _ _ _ _ T
- Contains I and N, but not in positions 3 or 4 respectively? Actually, note:
  - In POINT, I was at position 3 and marked as wrong position. So I cannot be at position 3, but could be elsewhere.
  - Similarly, N was at position 4 and marked as wrong position, so N cannot be at position 4.

Also, we know the word is 5 letters, and we have 3 known letters: T (position 5), I (somewhere but not position 3), and N (somewhere but not position 4).

We need to find a word that fits.

The positions:
We have positions 1, 2, and 3 open for I and N (and other letters) but note that I cannot be at position 3 and N cannot be at position 4. Since position 5 is taken by T, position 4 is still available? However, N cannot be at position 4? Actually, position 4 is still free? Yes because we haven't tested N in position 4 again? No, the feedback only says that in guess 2, N was at position 4 and that was the wrong position. But it doesn't mean N couldn't be elsewhere? We know N is in the word, but we don't know where it is exactly.

But from guess 2, we ruled out position 4 for N? Actually, the rule: a '-' for N at position 4 means that the letter N is in the word but not in that specific position. So N is in the word, but not at position 4.

Similarly, I is in the word, but not at position 3.

Now, considering the structure: _ _ _ _ T

We have I and N to place in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4? But note:
- Position 4: We cannot put N there? So N must be in position 1, 2, or 3? Because position 4 is forbidden for N? But wait, position 4 is available? Just that in this guess, when we put N at position 4 it was wrong. So we can place N in position 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4). Similarly, I can be in position 1, 2, or 4? But not position 3.

Also, we must note that the word might have more letters? We only know 3 letters: T, I, N.

So, we need a word that has at least T, I, N. And we know 5 letters total? So two more letters.

But we have two more slots to fill? Because we have positions 1,2,3 and 4? Actually, position 5 is T, so positions 1-4 must be filled with other letters including I and N? But note, exactly: the word must contain I and N, and then two other letters that we haven't eliminated.

We have eliminated: S, L, A, E, P, O. So we avoid those.

So available letters: all except S,L,A,E,P,O.

Now, since T is fixed at position 5, we have positions 1,2,3,4 to place I and N and two other letters.

Constraints:
- I cannot be at position 3? Actually, from POINT we got I(-) at position 3, so I is not at position 3? Therefore I must be at position 1,2, or 4.
- N cannot be at position 4? Therefore N must be at position 1,2, or 3.

But note: if we put I at position 1, then N would have to be at position 2 or 3? Then the other positions? Similarly, if I is at position 2, then N at position 1 or 3? Etc.

We need to find a word pattern: _ _ _ _ T, and must contain I and N, and two other letters that are not S,L,A,E,P,O.

Also, we have to consider: the word might have duplicate letters? But so far we don't have evidence of duplicates? Let's assume no duplicates for now to simplify.

Now, let's think of common words ending with T and containing I and N.

For example, words that end with T: think of common words.

Possible: ""PAINT"" -> but P is forbidden and A is forbidden? So invalid.

""JOINT"" -> J is not eliminated, O is forbidden? O we know is absent (from POINT: O was marked x). So cannot use JOINT.

""MINTY""? M,I,N,T,Y -> T is at position 4? But we need T at position 5. So ""MINTY"" is MINTY, so T at position 4? We need T at position 5. So words ending in T.

What about ""FRUIT""? F,R,U,I,T -> positions: F(1), R(2), R? Actually, U(3), I(4), T(5). So T at position 5. Now, check the forbidden letters: F, R, U, I are not forbidden? Forbidden are S,L,A,E,P,O. So FRUIT uses F,R,U,I,T -> okay? But note: we have I at position 4? And in this word, we have I and N? Wait, FRUIT does not have N? That's a problem. We know the word must contain N? Because from POINT, we had N marked as present. So FRUIT doesn't have N -> invalid.

We need a word that contains both I and N? And ends in T.

What about ""POINT"" again? We already tried that? And got feedback: so we cannot reuse without reason.

Another word: ""PRINT"" -> P,R,I,N,T -> ends with T. But P is absent? From Guess2: P(x) so P is absent? Therefore PRINT has P -> forbidden. So invalid.

""QUINT"" -> Q,U,I,N,T -> ends with T. Q is not forbidden? And U: we haven't tested U. But is Q common? Not really? Also, let's see the positions: 
In QUINT: Q(1), U(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> but in Guess2 we tried POINT: at position 3 we had I and it was marked as present but wrong position? And at position 4 we had N and wrong position. But note: in QUINT, I is at position 3? But from Guess2, we know I cannot be at position 3? Because we had I(-) in position 3 meaning that position is not I? So if QUINT has I at position 3, it would be invalid? Therefore QUINT cannot be the word? Actually, because I cannot be at position 3? So QUINT would be disallowed.

Another word: ""FLINT"" -> F,L,I,N,T -> L is forbidden? From Guess1: L(x) -> L is absent? So FLINT has L -> invalid.

""COUNT"" -> C,O,U,N,T -> O is absent? From Guess2: O(x) -> forbidden? Invalid.

""VAUNT"" -> V,A,U,N,T -> A forbidden? Invalid.

""HAUNT"" -> H,A,U,N,T -> A forbidden? Invalid.

""GRANT"" -> G,R,A,N,T -> A forbidden? Invalid.

What about ""BENCH"" -> doesn't end with T and no I?

We need to include I and N? Or wait, what letters must be in? We know I and N are in the word? Yes? So we must use both.

Also, avoid forbidden letters: S,L,A,E,P,O.

Another idea: ""MINTS"" -> but ends with S? Not T? And S forbidden? Also, duplicate T? No, MINT with S? No.

Perhaps ""MIGHT"" -> no N? 

""LIGHT"" -> contains L? Forbidden.

""FIGHT"" -> no N? 

""NIGHT"" -> N,I,G,H,T -> ends with T? Yes, T at position 5? So N,I,G,H,T. Check forbidden letters: none are forbidden? Because forbidden are S,L,A,E,P,O. So letters N,I,G,H are okay? 

In NIGHT: 
- Position 1: N
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: G
- Position 4: H
- Position 5: T

Now, check if this fits the constraints:
1. T is at position 5: correct.
2. I is present and in the word? Here at position 2.
   - Previously, we only knew that I could not be at position 3? Now we are putting it at position 2: that's allowed? Because position 3 was ruled out? 
   - Similarly, N is at position 1? Previously, we knew N could not be at position 4? Position 1 is allowed.

Now, what about the previous clue: 
In Guess2: POINT, we had N at position 4? Which was marked wrong? So if we put N at position 1, that would be okay? Similarly, I at position 2? Was that tried? No, POINT had I at position 3? So we haven't tried I at position 2? So this is a new position for I.

Therefore, ""NIGHT"" seems like a candidate? But let's verify with the feedback we have?

Also, we haven't tested G and H? So we might get additional information? But the word NIGHT ends with T? And has I and N? 

But wait: we don't know if G and H are in? But they could be? Or not? 

Another candidate: ""RIGHT"", but R is not forbidden? And we have R? Then R,I,G,H,T? Similarly.

But note: we don't know about R? We haven't tested R? In fact, we haven't tested many letters.

But we need to choose a word that uses only available letters? And fits the known facts.

Now, comparing ""NIGHT"" and other words? Also, ""TIGHT""? But T is already at the end? And we need T only at position 5? Also, TIGHT has T at the beginning? But that would be the same T? The word only has one T? But the secret word might have only one T? Because we had only one T marked present? Anyway, we don't know.

But ""NIGHT"" doesn't duplicate T? And starts with N? 

However, in Guess2 (POINT), we had N at position 4 and it was marked as present? But in NIGHT, N is now at position 1? So that's consistent? Because position 4 was wrong, so it can be at position 1? Similarly, I was at position 3? and now would be at position 2? 

So NIGHT appears to be valid? 

But wait, is G and H tested? We don't know? We need to guess? 

Alternatively, we might choose a word that includes letters we haven't tested? But we only have two unknowns? Actually, we have two slots? Or three because? Wait: the word has 5 letters: 
Positions: 1,2,3,4: which must include the letters I and N? And two others? So yes.

In NIGHT, the two others are G and H? We haven't tested them, so it's good? We might get more information? 

But we have only 4 guesses left? We should use a word that maximizes information? Possibly? 

How about a word that has more common letters? But common letters: since we've tested a few? 

Another candidate: ""DWELT""? But D,W,E,L,T -> E and L are forbidden? Invalid.

""UNIFY""? Doesn't end in T? 

Also, we must remember that the secret word contains I and N? Because of the feedback? So we must have both? 

Therefore, ""NIGHT"" seems a reasonable guess? 

Alternatively, ""POINT"" was already guessed? So we don't guess that again? 

Another word: ""QUILT""? But in QUILT? Q,U,I,L,T -> L forbidden? Invalid.

""SKINT""? S forbidden? 

What about ""SPENT""? S and E forbidden? 

Another candidate: ""BIRTH"" -> B,I,R,T,H -> but T is at position 4? We need T at position 5? So no.

We need words ending with T and containing I and N? 

With the constraints: I not at position 3, N not at position 4? 

Common words: ""STINT"": but S forbidden? 

""JOINT"": O forbidden? 

""FAINT"": A forbidden? 

Actually, it's harder? 

But note: we might have also tried ""HAINT""? Not a common word? And A forbidden? 

""POINT"" is already tried? 

So perhaps ""NIGHT"" is a good candidate? 

But wait: ""NIGHT"" has I at position 2? And N at position 1? 

Now, we also need to check: are there any conflicts? 

For position 1? We don't have any feedback? Position 2? Same? 

Therefore, I think we should go with ""NIGHT"". 

To confirm: 
If the word is NIGHT? Then the previous feedback: 
Guess1: SLATE -> T is present? But in NIGHT, T is at position 5? And position 4 was wrong? So in SLATE, T was at position 4? And then moved? So it's consistent? 

Guess2: POINT -> 
In POINT: P(absent), O(absent), I present? In NIGHT, I is at position 2? So not at position 3? So that's why I(-). Similarly, N is at position 1? Not at position 4? So N(-) and T correct at position 5? So it matches? 

Therefore, NIGHT is plausible? But we don't know? But it fits the constraints? 

Therefore, we guess ""NIGHT""? 

Alternatively, we might consider ""MIGHT""? M,I,G,H,T? Same? M is not forbidden? 

But M is also common? We don't have information on M? 

Similarly, H? 

But both are untested? 

But NIGHT starts with N? Which we know is present? And in this case, position 1 might be N? 

Similarly, we could try ""TWIST""? But T at the beginning? And W,I,S,T? S forbidden? So invalid? 

No? 

Another candidate: ""FRUIT"" doesn't have N? 

Then ""BEGIN"" -> doesn't end with T? 

So I think ""NIGHT"" is the best? 

But note: we haven't tested G and H? So if NIGHT is wrong, we get information on G and H? 

So, let's proceed with ""NIGHT"". 

If we get it wrong, we'll know about G and H? 

Another option: we might try a word with letters that are very common? And includes I and N? And ends with T? And avoids the known absent letters? 

For example, ""WINCE"" -> no T? 

""BOUND"" -> no T? 

Actually, another word: ""WRIST"" -> has S? 

""DAINT"" -> not valid? 

So I think ""NIGHT"" is fine? 

But wait: what about ""DINET""? Not valid? 

""PINTO"" -> no T? 

So maybe we go with NIGHT? 

So our next guess: ""NIGHT"" 

But also, we must be cautious: the word might have duplicate letters? For example, maybe the word is ""MINTS""? But S forbidden? 

So I think no? 

Conclusion: let's guess ""NIGHT"". 

So response format: 

<guess>NIGHT</guess> 

But note: we must only return the word? 

But let me double-check: 
- Secret word must end with T? Yes? 
- Must contain I and N? Yes? 
- With I not at position 3? In NIGHT, I is at position 2? So not 3? 
- N not at position 4? In NIGHT, N is at position 1? So not 4? 
- Also, no forbidden letters: N,I,G,H,T -> none of S,L,A,E,P,O? 
- G and H are not eliminated? 

So yes? 

Therefore, our next guess: NIGHTBased on the feedback from previous guesses:

**Feedback Summary:**
- S, L, A, E, P, O are **absent**.
- T is **present** and in the **correct position (5)**: i.e., the word ends with T.
- I is **present** but **not in position 3**.
- N is **present** but **not in position 4**.

**Conclusions:**
- The secret word ends with T: `_ _ _ _ T`.
- It contains I and N.
- I cannot be in position 3 (tried in POINT).
- N cannot be in position 4 (tried in POINT).
- Avoid eliminated letters: S, L, A, E, P, O.

**Strategy for Next Guess:**
- Place T in position 5 (known).
- Position I in a new location (not position 3), so options are 1, 2, or 4.
- Position N in a new location (not position 4), so options are 1, 2, or 3.
- Test new common consonants (e.g., G, H) to gather additional information.

After evaluating possible words that fit these constraints (e.g., ends with T, includes I and N, avoids eliminated letters), ""NIGHT"" is a valid candidate. It:
- Places I in position 2 (new position).
- Places N in position 1 (new position).
- Avoids eliminated letters.
- Introduces untested letters G and H for more feedback.",Guess 3: NIGHT -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) I(✓) G(✓) H(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
