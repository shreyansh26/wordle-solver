We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: - (meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
 R: - (R is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
 A: x (A is not in the secret word)
 N: x (N is not in the secret word)
 E: - (E is in the secret word but in the wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters C, R, and E, but not A or N.
 - The positions of C, R, and E in ""crane"" are incorrect.

 Since the secret word is 5 letters, and we know it has C, R, E, and does not have A or N.

 We also know that in the first guess:
   Position 1: C is present but not here -> so the secret word's first letter is not C.
   Position 2: R is present but not here -> so the secret word's second letter is not R.
   Position 3: A is absent -> so we avoid A.
   Position 4: N is absent -> so we avoid N.
   Position 5: E is present but not here -> so the secret word's fifth letter is not E.

 Now, we need to make a second guess that:
   - Is a valid 5-letter English word.
   - Contains the letters C, R, and E (since they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
   - Does not contain A or N (since they are absent).
   - We can include other letters that we haven't tried yet, but we should avoid repeating the same positions for C, R, E.

 Let's think about the positions:
   In ""crane"", the positions were:
     1: C (must not be in position 1 in the secret word, but must be in the word)
     2: R (must not be in position 2, but must be in the word)
     5: E (must not be in position 5, but must be in the word)

 So for our next guess, we should place:
   C not in position 1
   R not in position 2
   E not in position 5

 Also, we must avoid A and N.

 We can try to form a word that uses C, R, E and two new letters.

 Let's think of common letters and try to form a word.

 Since we have three known letters (C, R, E) and two unknown, we can try to place them in positions that are allowed.

 Possible positions for C: 2,3,4,5 (but not 1)
 Possible positions for R: 1,3,4,5 (but not 2)
 Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)

 We also note that the secret word has exactly these three and two more.

 Let's try to think of words that have C, R, E and two other letters (excluding A and N).

 We can consider common consonants and vowels. Since we don't have any vowels confirmed (A is out, but we might have others), we should try to include other vowels? The word must have at least one vowel (like E, which we already have, but maybe others?).

 We have E, so we can try words with E and perhaps another vowel? But we don't know which vowels are present. We know A is absent, so we can try I, O, U.

 Let's try to form words:

 We can try putting R at the beginning? (position 1) because that's allowed.

 Example: R _ _ _ _

 We also need C and E. And we avoid A and N.

 Let's try: R _ _ C E -> but E cannot be at the end (position 5) because the feedback said E is not in position 5. So we cannot put E at the end.

 We must put E in positions 1,2,3, or 4.

 How about: R _ E _ _ 

 Then we have to place C somewhere (not position 1, and not position 3 because we have E there? Actually, we can put C in position 2,3,4,5 but we have to avoid position 1 and also we have position 3 taken by E? So position 2,4,5? But we are building R _ E _ _.

 So positions: 
   1: R
   2: ? (can be C? but we have to avoid putting R in position 2? Actually, the constraint for R is that it cannot be in position 2 in the secret word? But in our guess, we can put R in position 1 and that's fine. The constraint for R in the guess is only that we cannot put it in position 2? Actually, no: the feedback told us that in the secret word, R is not in position 2. But in our guess, we can put R anywhere? However, we want to test new positions.

 But note: we are allowed to put R in position 1 in our guess? Yes, because the feedback only said that in the secret word, R is not in position 2. It might be in position 1.

 Similarly, we can put E in position 3? Yes, because the feedback only said E is not in position 5.

 Now, we need to fill the other two blanks with letters that are not A or N, and we don't know if they are in the secret word or not.

 Let's try to form a word: R ? E ? ?

 We have to include C. So we can put C in position 2? Then we have: R C E ? ?

 What words are there? ""RCE"" is not common. We can try ""RICE"" but that's 4 letters? We need 5. So we need two more letters? Actually, we have 5: positions 1,2,3,4,5: R, C, E, and then two more.

 How about ""RICES""? But that's 5 letters? ""RICES"" is not a common word. We need a valid English word.

 Alternatively, we can put C in position 4: R ? E C ?

 Then we have: R, then a letter, then E, then C, then a letter.

 Example: R U E C K -> ""RUECK"" is not a word.

 Another idea: put C in position 5? But we have to avoid E in position 5, but C can be in position 5? Yes. Then: R ? E ? C

 But then we have to fill the two blanks. Example: R I E S C -> ""Riesc"" is not a word.

 Alternatively, we can try a different arrangement.

 Let's try starting with E? But E cannot be at the end, but we can put it at the beginning? Yes.

 Example: E _ _ _ _

 Then we need R and C. We can put R in position 3? (since it cannot be in position 2, but position 3 is allowed) and C in position 4? Then: E _ R C _

 We avoid A and N. What can we put in position 2 and 5? We need a word.

 Example: E S R C ? -> ""ESRC"" is not a complete word.

 How about ""ESCORT""? Too long.

 We need 5 letters. Let me think of words that have C, R, E and two other letters (not A, N).

 Common words: 
   ""SCARE"" -> but has A (which is absent) -> invalid.
   ""CREST"" -> has C, R, E, S, T. And no A or N.

 Let's check ""CREST"":
   C is in position 1 -> but we know that in the secret word, C is not in position 1 (from the first feedback: C was in position 1 and got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not in position 1). So we cannot put C in position 1 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. We should avoid putting C in position 1.

 So ""CREST"" has C at position 1 -> not good.

 How about ""TRACE""? But has A -> invalid.

 How about ""ROUCE""? Not a word.

 Another idea: ""RECUT"" -> has E, C, U, T, and R? Let's see: R in position 1? But we can put R in position 1? Yes. But the word is ""RECUT"": 
   R in position 1, E in position 2, C in position 3, U in position 4, T in position 5.

 But we have constraints:
   E cannot be in position 5? That's okay because E is in position 2.
   However, we also have to check the positions for C and R:
      R: in position 1 -> that's allowed (since the secret word's R is not in position 2, but it could be in 1).
      C: in position 3 -> that's allowed (since the secret word's C is not in position 1, but 3 is new).
      E: in position 2 -> that's allowed (since the secret word's E is not in position 5, but 2 is new).

 But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that the secret word has C, R, E. It doesn't say anything about U or T.

 However, we are avoiding A and N, and U and T are okay.

 But is ""RECUT"" a word? Yes, it means to cut again.

 But let's see: we are not violating any known constraints.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRUEL"":
   C in position 1 -> not allowed (we know C is not in position 1 in the secret word). So avoid.

 How about ""SCREW"": 
   S, C, R, E, W.
   C is in position 2 -> allowed (since C cannot be in 1, but 2 is okay).
   R is in position 3 -> allowed (since R cannot be in 2, but 3 is okay).
   E is in position 4 -> allowed (since E cannot be in 5, and 4 is okay).

 And the word doesn't have A or N.

 So ""SCREW"" is a candidate.

 But let's check the positions for the known letters in the secret word:
   We know the secret word has C, but not in position 1. In ""SCREW"", C is in position 2 -> that's a new position, so we can test it.
   Similarly, R is in position 3 (new, because previously it was in position 2, now we are testing 3).
   E is in position 4 (new, because previously it was in position 5, now we are testing 4).

 Also, we are introducing S and W.

 So ""SCREW"" seems like a good candidate.

 Another candidate: ""CRWTH""? Not common and has no vowels? Actually, it's a word but has no E? We need E.

 How about ""CREPT"": 
   C in position 1 -> not allowed.

 How about ""CROWD"": 
   C in position 1 -> not allowed.

 How about ""CERT""? Only 4 letters.

 Another candidate: ""PERCH"": 
   P, E, R, C, H.
   E is in position 2 -> allowed.
   R is in position 3 -> allowed.
   C is in position 4 -> allowed.
   And we avoid A and N.

 But note: we are putting C in position 4? That's okay. And E in position 2? Okay.

 However, we are not using the fact that we know the secret word has C, R, E. In ""PERCH"", we have all three? Yes: E, R, C.

 But we are introducing P and H.

 How about ""WREAK""? But has A -> invalid.

 Another: ""FRECK"" -> not a word.

 Let me compare ""SCREW"" and ""PERCH"". Both are valid.

 But note: in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and we know the secret word has C, R, E. We are trying to cover more common letters? We might want to use letters that are more frequent.

 Also, we want to test the letters in positions that are allowed.

 I think ""SCREW"" is a good choice because:
   - It uses the known letters (C, R, E) in positions that are not the ones we know are wrong.
   - It introduces two new letters: S and W.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRISP"" but C is in position 1 -> invalid.

 Another word: ""SERAC"" -> 
   S, E, R, A, C -> but A is present? We cannot use A because we know A is absent.

 How about ""SERVE""? 
   S, E, R, V, E -> has two E's? But we don't know if the secret word has two E's? It might. But we know the secret word has at least one E. However, we are introducing V and another E? But we are not sure.

 But in ""SERVE"", E is in position 2 and 5. We know that E cannot be in position 5? So if we put E in position 5, and if the secret word has only one E, then the E in position 5 might be marked as absent? But wait, the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not in position 5. So if the secret word has only one E, then we cannot put E in position 5. But if it has two, then it might be okay? However, we don't know.

 To avoid confusion, we might avoid repeating E? But we are allowed to use E again? Actually, we can, but it might not be efficient.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word without repeating letters? ""SCREW"" has distinct letters: S, C, R, E, W.

 Similarly, ""PERCH"" has distinct letters: P, E, R, C, H.

 Both are good.

 But let's look at the feedback again: we know the secret word has C, R, E. We don't know about the other two. We want to maximize information.

 ""SCREW"" uses S and W, which are common consonants.

 ""PERCH"" uses P and H, also common.

 I think both are acceptable. I'll go with ""SCREW"" because it has S at the beginning, which is common.

 So my second guess: ""SCREW""

 But let me double-check the positions for the known letters in ""SCREW"":
   Position 1: S -> we don't know if S is in the word or not.
   Position 2: C -> we know C is in the word, but not in position 1. Now we are testing position 2.
   Position 3: R -> we know R is in the word, but not in position 2. Now we are testing position 3.
   Position 4: E -> we know E is in the word, but not in position 5. Now we are testing position 4.
   Position 5: W -> unknown.

 This guess will give us information about the positions of C, R, E and also about S and W.

 Therefore, I choose ""SCREW"".

<guess>screw</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked with -).
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2 (marked with -).
- A is not in the secret word (marked with x).
- N is not in the secret word (marked with x).
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (marked with -).

Key insights:
- The secret word contains C, R, and E, but excludes A and N.
- C cannot be in position 1, R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.

For the second guess, I need a 5-letter word that:
- Includes C, R, and E.
- Avoids A and N.
- Places C not in position 1, R not in position 2, and E not in position 5.
- Tests new positions for known letters and introduces new letters for maximum information.

The word ""screw"" fits perfectly:
- C is in position 2 (new position, not 1).
- R is in position 3 (new position, not 2).
- E is in position 4 (new position, not 5).
- Introduces new letters S (position 1) and W (position 5) to test their presence.
- Valid English word with distinct letters.

This guess efficiently tests the constraints while exploring new letters.

<guess>screw</guess>",screw,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":

 E: - (E is in the secret word but in the wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters C, R, and E, but not A or N.
 - The positions of C, R, and E in ""crane"" are incorrect.

 Since the secret word is 5 letters, and we know it has C, R, E, and does not have A or N.

 We also know that in the first guess:
   Position 1: C is present but not here -> so the secret word's first letter is not C.

   Position 4: N is absent -> so we avoid N.
   Position 5: E is present but not here -> so the secret word's fifth letter is not E.

 Now, we need to make a second guess that:

 Another idea: ""RECUT"" -> has E, C, U, T, and R? Let's see: R in position 1? But we can put R in position 1? Yes. But the word is ""RECUT"": 
   R in position 1, E in position 2, C in position 3, U in position 4, T in position 5.

 But we have constraints:
   E cannot be in position 5? That's okay because E is in position 2.
   However, we also have to check the positions for C and R:
      R: in position 1 -> that's allowed (since the secret word's R is not in position 2, but it could be in 1).
      C: in position 3 -> that's allowed (since the secret word's C is not in position 1, but 3 is new).
      E: in position 2 -> that's allowed (since the secret word's E is not in position 5, but 2 is new).

 But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that the secret word has C, R, E. It doesn't say anything about U or T.

 However, we are avoiding A and N, and U and T are okay.

 But is ""RECUT"" a word? Yes, it means to cut again.

 But let's see: we are not violating any known constraints.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRUEL"":
   C in position 1 -> not allowed (we know C is not in position 1 in the secret word). So avoid.

 How about ""SCREW"": 
   S, C, R, E, W.
   C is in position 2 -> allowed (since C cannot be in 1, but 2 is okay).
   R is in position 3 -> allowed (since R cannot be in 2, but 3 is okay).
   E is in position 4 -> allowed (since E cannot be in 5, and 4 is okay).

 And the word doesn't have A or N.

 So ""SCREW"" is a candidate.

 But let's check the positions for the known letters in the secret word:
   We know the secret word has C, but not in position 1. In ""SCREW"", C is in position 2 -> that's a new position, so we can test it.
   Similarly, R is in position 3 (new, because previously it was in position 2, now we are testing 3).
   E is in position 4 (new, because previously it was in position 5, now we are testing 4).

 Also, we are introducing S and W.

 So ""SCREW"" seems like a good candidate.

 Another candidate: ""CRWTH""? Not common and has no vowels? Actually, it's a word but has no E? We need E.

 How about ""CREPT"": 
   C in position 1 -> not allowed.

 How about ""CROWD"": 
   C in position 1 -> not allowed.

 How about ""CERT""? Only 4 letters.

 Another candidate: ""PERCH"": 
   P, E, R, C, H.
   E is in position 2 -> allowed.
   R is in position 3 -> allowed.
   C is in position 4 -> allowed.
   And we avoid A and N.

 But note: we are putting C in position 4? That's okay. And E in position 2? Okay.

 However, we are not using the fact that we know the secret word has C, R, E. In ""PERCH"", we have all three? Yes: E, R, C.

 But we are introducing P and H.

 How about ""WREAK""? But has A -> invalid.

 Another: ""FRECK"" -> not a word.

 Let me compare ""SCREW"" and ""PERCH"". Both are valid.

 But note: in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and we know the secret word has C, R, E. We are trying to cover more common letters? We might want to use letters that are more frequent.

 Also, we want to test the letters in positions that are allowed.

 I think ""SCREW"" is a good choice because:
   - It uses the known letters (C, R, E) in positions that are not the ones we know are wrong.
   - It introduces two new letters: S and W.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRISP"" but C is in position 1 -> invalid.

 Another word: ""SERAC"" -> 
   S, E, R, A, C -> but A is present? We cannot use A because we know A is absent.

 How about ""SERVE""? 
   S, E, R, V, E -> has two E's? But we don't know if the secret word has two E's? It might. But we know the secret word has at least one E. However, we are introducing V and another E? But we are not sure.

 But in ""SERVE"", E is in position 2 and 5. We know that E cannot be in position 5? So if we put E in position 5, and if the secret word has only one E, then the E in position 5 might be marked as absent? But wait, the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not in position 5. So if the secret word has only one E, then we cannot put E in position 5. But if it has two, then it might be okay? However, we don't know.

 To avoid confusion, we might avoid repeating E? But we are allowed to use E again? Actually, we can, but it might not be efficient.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word without repeating letters? ""SCREW"" has distinct letters: S, C, R, E, W.

 Similarly, ""PERCH"" has distinct letters: P, E, R, C, H.

 Both are good.

 But let's look at the feedback again: we know the secret word has C, R, E. We don't know about the other two. We want to maximize information.

 ""SCREW"" uses S and W, which are common consonants.

 ""PERCH"" uses P and H, also common.

 I think both are acceptable. I'll go with ""SCREW"" because it has S at the beginning, which is common.

 So my second guess: ""SCREW""

 But let me double-check the positions for the known letters in ""SCREW"":
   Position 1: S -> we don't know if S is in the word or not.
   Position 2: C -> we know C is in the word, but not in position 1. Now we are testing position 2.
   Position 3: R -> we know R is in the word, but not in position 2. Now we are testing position 3.
   Position 4: E -> we know E is in the word, but not in position 5. Now we are testing position 4.
   Position 5: W -> unknown.

 This guess will give us information about the positions of C, R, E and also about S and W.

 Therefore, I choose ""SCREW"".

<guess>screw</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked with -).
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2 (marked with -).
- A is not in the secret word (marked with x).
- N is not in the secret word (marked with x).
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (marked with -).

Key insights:
- The secret word contains C, R, and E, but excludes A and N.
- C cannot be in position 1, R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.

For the second guess, I need a 5-letter word that:
- Includes C, R, and E.
- Avoids A and N.
- Places C not in position 1, R not in position 2, and E not in position 5.
- Tests new positions for known letters and introduces new letters for maximum information.

The word ""screw"" fits perfectly:
- C is in position 2 (new position, not 1).
- R is in position 3 (new position, not 2).
- E is in position 4 (new position, not 5).
- Introduces new letters S (position 1) and W (position 5) to test their presence.
- Valid English word with distinct letters.

This guess efficiently tests the constraints while exploring new letters.",Guess 2: screw -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(✓) R(✓) E(✓) W(✓),SUCCESS
