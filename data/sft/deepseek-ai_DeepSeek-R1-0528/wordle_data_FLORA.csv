We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) : C is not in the secret word.
 R(-) : R is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
 A(-) : A is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
 N(x) : N is not in the secret word.
 E(x) : E is not in the secret word.

 So, we know the secret word contains R and A, but not C, N, or E.
 Also, R and A are not in the positions they were in the guess ""crane"". In ""crane"", R was the second letter and A was the third.

 Since R was in the second position in the guess and it's marked wrong position, that means R is either in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 in the secret word? Let me note the positions:
 Position 1: C -> x
 Position 2: R -> - (so R is in the word but not in position 2)
 Position 3: A -> - (so A is in the word but not in position 3)
 Position 4: N -> x
 Position 5: E -> x

 We know the word has 5 letters and must contain R and A, but exclude C, N, E.

 Also, since R and A are present but in wrong positions, let us try to think of words that have R and A, without C, N, E.

 Now, we have to make a second guess. We want a word that:
   - Does not contain R in position 2 or A in position 3.
   - Does not contain C, N, E at all.

 Additionally, we might want to reuse other letters to test for more common consonants? But note: we don't know what other letters might be in the word.

 Since we know A is in the word, let's try to place A in a different position. Similarly for R.

 Possibilities for R: We can try putting R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, any except 2.
 Similarly, A: any except 3.

 We also don't know other letters. So, we can try a word that includes other common letters not yet tested? Such as T, S, L, etc.

 Important: We must avoid C, N, E.

 Let's think of words that have R, A, and maybe some new letters.

 Since we have only eliminated three letters (C, N, E) and the word has five letters, we have many possibilities.

 We can try a word with R in the first position? But note: if we put R in the first position, then we might get more information quickly.

 Some common words: 

 Example: ""RATIO""? But we don't know if O, I, T are in the word. Also, note that we haven't tested I, O, T. But wait, A is in ""RATIO"" and it's in position 2? We cannot have A in position 3? Actually, in ""RATIO"", A is in position 2. We don't know about position 2 for A yet? Only that in the previous guess A was in position 3 and that was wrong. So A might be in position 2? 

 However, the feedback only said that when A was in position 3 it was wrong. So A could be in position 2? Similarly, R was in position 2 and that was wrong, but R could be in any other position.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that puts A in position 1 and R in position 4 or 5? 

 Let me compile a list of common letters that we haven't eliminated: the alphabet without C, N, E: 
 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ without C, N, E -> leaves: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

 We know A and R are in the word. So we need to guess with A and R, plus three other letters that we haven't tried.

 We haven't tried many. We can try:

 Let me think of words that have A and R and avoid C,N,E.

 Possible words: 
   - ""PARTY"": has P,A,R,T,Y -> avoids C,N,E.
   - ""FARTS"": avoids C,N,E? But we might not want to guess that... 
   - ""STARK"": S,T,A,R,K -> avoids C,N,E.

 Alternatively, we can try to use different positions.

 We have:
   - Position 2: we now know it's not R? But we don't know what is in position two? Actually, we know that the secret word has A and R, and the first guess had C in position 1 which was wrong.

 Another idea: We also know that in the first guess, the letter in position 1 was incorrect (so not C), position 2 was R but wrong (so the secret word does not have R at position 2), position 3 was A but wrong (so secret word does not have A at position 3), position 4 was N (wrong and not in the word) and position 5 was E (wrong and not in the word).

 Let me think of a word that has:
   - R in position 1,4, or 5? 
   - A in position 1,2,4, or 5? 

 And we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Option: ""ROAST"": This word has R, O, A, S, T. It avoids C,N,E. But note:
   Position 1: R -> we are testing R in position 1? Also, in the secret word, R might be in position 1? 
   Position 2: O -> new letter
   Position 3: A -> but we know from previous feedback that A cannot be in position 3! So that would be a bad choice because we know the secret word does not have A in position 3. 

 Therefore, we cannot try a word that has A in position 3? Or R in position 2? We must avoid the positions we know they are not.

 So ""ROAST"" is invalid for this because A is forced into position 3? But we know it's not in position 3. So we skip that.

 Alternatively, ""RATIO"": Has R at position 1, A at position 2, T, I, O. 
   Position 3: T -> unknown
   Position 4: I -> unknown
   Position 5: O -> unknown

 But we don't know if the secret word has T,I,O. And we avoid C,N,E.

 Alternatively, ""STAIR"": S,T,A,I,R. 
   Positions: 
     1: S
     2: T
     3: A -> we know A cannot be in position 3? So that's bad.

 How about ""TRIAL"": T,R,I,A,L? 
   Position 1: T
   Position 2: R -> but we know that R should not be in position 2? Because in the first guess R was in position 2 and it was wrong. So we must avoid R in position 2? Therefore, ""TRIAL"" is invalid.

 So we avoid both R in position 2 and A in position 3.

 Another idea: ""PARTY"": 
   P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)
   Now: 
      A is in position 2 -> not position 3? That's okay because the rule about A was only that it was wrong in position 3, but we don't know about other positions? 
      Similarly, R is in position 3 -> which is different from position 2? So that's okay.

 However, note: We don't know if position 3 is okay for R? The feedback only said that when R was in position 2 it was wrong. So R could be in position 3? Similarly, A is in position 2? It wasn't tested in position 2 before? Actually, we have no information about position 2 for A? Because the first guess had A only in position 3.

 Therefore, ""PARTY"" is a valid guess.

 Why is it valid?
   - It has A and R? (Yes)
   - A is in position 2? Which wasn't tested? So that might be correct? Or might be wrong? We don't know.
   - R is in position 3? Which we don't know? 

 We are testing R in a new position? And A in a new position? Also, introducing P, T, Y? 

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that places A and R in positions we haven't tested? But actually, we haven't tested any other positions? Only we know position 2 and position 3 in the first guess? 

 However, we have two letters that must be in the word: R and A. 

 I think ""PARTY"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters.

 Another candidate: ""STRAY"": 
   S (1), T (2), R (3), A (4), Y (5) 
   This avoids R in position 2 and A in position 3? Yes? 
   Also, the letters S,T,R,A,Y? All new? 

 How about ""TRAPS"": 
   T (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? Because first feedback said R is not in position 2? So that would be invalid.

 How about ""RADAR"": 
   R (1), A (2), D (3), A (4), R (5). 
   But note: the word has duplicate R and A? We don't know if the secret word has duplicates? We haven't been told? The rules don't say that the word has distinct letters? But Wordle typically allows repeated letters? So that's possible? 

 But note the feedback: In the first guess, each letter was evaluated independently? And we only know that the secret word must have at least one R and at least one A? It could have more? 

 However, to keep it simple, maybe we avoid duplicates for now? 

 Alternatively, let me think: We want to maximize information? 

 Considering the above, let me propose ""STRAY"".

 But note: we might have a problem? In ""STRAY"", the R is in position 3 and A is in position 4. 

 Other options: ""RAYON""? But ""RAYON"" has Y and O? But we haven't tested? But note: ""RAYON"" avoids C,N,E? But wait, N is eliminated? Oh, ""RAYON"" has N? Which we know is not in the word? Because first feedback said N is not in the word? -> So ""RAYON"" is invalid? Because it contains N? So we must avoid N?

 Therefore, we cannot choose ""RAYON"".

 Let me stick with ""STRAY"". 

 Now, ""STRAY"":
   S -> new, not tested? So it's safe? 
   T -> new?
   R -> we know is in the word? So we are testing R at position 3?
   A -> at position 4? 
   Y -> new.

 We don't have any constraints against position 3 for R? Or position 4 for A? Since the only constraints are R not at 2 and A not at 3? 

 So ""STRAY"" seems okay.

 Alternatively, ""PARTY"" also seems okay, but using P? 

 Since we don't know, I'm going to choose ""PARTY"" because it introduces P, T, Y? Which might be helpful? 

 But let me think: T is a common letter? 

 I'll go with ""PARTY"".

 So the guess is ""PARTY"".

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- R and A **are** in the secret word, but they were in incorrect positions (R was position 2, A was position 3).

For my next guess:
- Must include R and A (since they are confirmed in the word).
- Avoid C, N, E entirely.
- Position R anywhere except position 2 (since feedback showed R is not in position 2).
- Position A anywhere except position 3 (since feedback showed A is not in position 3).
- Test new common consonants like T, P, and Y to gather more information.

I chose **""party""**:
- P (position 1): Untested letter to probe potential positions.
- A (position 2): Tests A in a new position given it can't be position 3.
- R (position 3): Tests R in a new position given it can't be position 2.
- T (position 4): Untested letter.
- Y (position 5): Untested letter.

This maximizes information by testing A/R in new positions while introducing 3 new letters (P, T, Y).

 R(-) : R is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
 A(-) : A is in the secret word but in the wrong position.

 E(x) : E is not in the secret word.

 So, we know the secret word contains R and A, but not C, N, or E.
 Also, R and A are not in the positions they were in the guess ""crane"". In ""crane"", R was the second letter and A was the third.

 Since R was in the second position in the guess and it's marked wrong position, that means R is either in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 in the secret word? Let me note the positions:

 Position 2: R -> - (so R is in the word but not in position 2)
 Position 3: A -> - (so A is in the word but not in position 3)

 We know the word has 5 letters and must contain R and A, but exclude C, N, E.

 We haven't tried many. We can try:

 Let me think of a word that has:
   - R in position 1,4, or 5? 
   - A in position 1,2,4, or 5? 

 And we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Option: ""ROAST"": This word has R, O, A, S, T. It avoids C,N,E. But note:
   Position 1: R -> we are testing R in position 1? Also, in the secret word, R might be in position 1?

   Position 3: A -> but we know from previous feedback that A cannot be in position 3! So that would be a bad choice because we know the secret word does not have A in position 3. 

 Therefore, we cannot try a word that has A in position 3? Or R in position 2? We must avoid the positions we know they are not.

 So ""ROAST"" is invalid for this because A is forced into position 3? But we know it's not in position 3. So we skip that.

 Alternatively, ""RATIO"": Has R at position 1, A at position 2, T, I, O. 
   Position 3: T -> unknown
   Position 4: I -> unknown
   Position 5: O -> unknown

 But we don't know if the secret word has T,I,O. And we avoid C,N,E.

 Alternatively, ""STAIR"": S,T,A,I,R. 
   Positions: 
     1: S
     2: T

 How about ""TRIAL"": T,R,I,A,L? 
   Position 1: T
   Position 2: R -> but we know that R should not be in position 2? Because in the first guess R was in position 2 and it was wrong. So we must avoid R in position 2? Therefore, ""TRIAL"" is invalid.

 So we avoid both R in position 2 and A in position 3.

 Another idea: ""PARTY"": 
   P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)
   Now: 
      A is in position 2 -> not position 3? That's okay because the rule about A was only that it was wrong in position 3, but we don't know about other positions?

 I think ""PARTY"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters.

 Another candidate: ""STRAY"":

 How about ""TRAPS"": 
   T (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? Because first feedback said R is not in position 2? So that would be invalid.

 How about ""RADAR"": 
   R (1), A (2), D (3), A (4), R (5). 
   But note: the word has duplicate R and A? We don't know if the secret word has duplicates? We haven't been told? The rules don't say that the word has distinct letters? But Wordle typically allows repeated letters? So that's possible? 

 But note the feedback: In the first guess, each letter was evaluated independently? And we only know that the secret word must have at least one R and at least one A? It could have more?

 But note: we might have a problem? In ""STRAY"", the R is in position 3 and A is in position 4.

Because first feedback said N is not in the word? -> So ""RAYON"" is invalid? Because it contains N? So we must avoid N?

 Therefore, we cannot choose ""RAYON"".

 Let me stick with ""STRAY"". 

 Now, ""STRAY"":
   S -> new, not tested? So it's safe? 
   T -> new?
   R -> we know is in the word? So we are testing R at position 3?
   A -> at position 4? 
   Y -> new.

 We don't have any constraints against position 3 for R? Or position 4 for A? Since the only constraints are R not at 2 and A not at 3? 

 So ""STRAY"" seems okay.

 Alternatively, ""PARTY"" also seems okay, but using P? 

 Since we don't know, I'm going to choose ""PARTY"" because it introduces P, T, Y? Which might be helpful? 

 But let me think: T is a common letter?

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,FLORA,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) : C is not in the secret word.
 R(-) : R is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
 A(-) : A is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
 N(x) : N is not in the secret word.
 E(x) : E is not in the secret word.

 So, we know the secret word contains R and A, but not C, N, or E.
 Also, R and A are not in the positions they were in the guess ""crane"". In ""crane"", R was the second letter and A was the third.

 Since R was in the second position in the guess and it's marked wrong position, that means R is either in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 in the secret word? Let me note the positions:
 Position 1: C -> x
 Position 2: R -> - (so R is in the word but not in position 2)
 Position 3: A -> - (so A is in the word but not in position 3)
 Position 4: N -> x
 Position 5: E -> x

 We know the word has 5 letters and must contain R and A, but exclude C, N, E.

 Also, since R and A are present but in wrong positions, let us try to think of words that have R and A, without C, N, E.

 Now, we have to make a second guess. We want a word that:
   - Does not contain R in position 2 or A in position 3.
   - Does not contain C, N, E at all.

 Additionally, we might want to reuse other letters to test for more common consonants? But note: we don't know what other letters might be in the word.

 Since we know A is in the word, let's try to place A in a different position. Similarly for R.

 Possibilities for R: We can try putting R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, any except 2.
 Similarly, A: any except 3.

 We also don't know other letters. So, we can try a word that includes other common letters not yet tested? Such as T, S, L, etc.

 Important: We must avoid C, N, E.

 Let's think of words that have R, A, and maybe some new letters.

 Since we have only eliminated three letters (C, N, E) and the word has five letters, we have many possibilities.

 We can try a word with R in the first position? But note: if we put R in the first position, then we might get more information quickly.

 Some common words: 

 Example: ""RATIO""? But we don't know if O, I, T are in the word. Also, note that we haven't tested I, O, T. But wait, A is in ""RATIO"" and it's in position 2? We cannot have A in position 3? Actually, in ""RATIO"", A is in position 2. We don't know about position 2 for A yet? Only that in the previous guess A was in position 3 and that was wrong. So A might be in position 2? 

 However, the feedback only said that when A was in position 3 it was wrong. So A could be in position 2? Similarly, R was in position 2 and that was wrong, but R could be in any other position.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that puts A in position 1 and R in position 4 or 5? 

 Let me compile a list of common letters that we haven't eliminated: the alphabet without C, N, E: 
 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ without C, N, E -> leaves: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

 We know A and R are in the word. So we need to guess with A and R, plus three other letters that we haven't tried.

 We haven't tried many. We can try:

 Let me think of words that have A and R and avoid C,N,E.

 Possible words: 
   - ""PARTY"": has P,A,R,T,Y -> avoids C,N,E.
   - ""FARTS"": avoids C,N,E? But we might not want to guess that... 
   - ""STARK"": S,T,A,R,K -> avoids C,N,E.

 Alternatively, we can try to use different positions.

 We have:
   - Position 2: we now know it's not R? But we don't know what is in position two? Actually, we know that the secret word has A and R, and the first guess had C in position 1 which was wrong.

 Another idea: We also know that in the first guess, the letter in position 1 was incorrect (so not C), position 2 was R but wrong (so the secret word does not have R at position 2), position 3 was A but wrong (so secret word does not have A at position 3), position 4 was N (wrong and not in the word) and position 5 was E (wrong and not in the word).

 Let me think of a word that has:
   - R in position 1,4, or 5? 
   - A in position 1,2,4, or 5? 

 And we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Option: ""ROAST"": This word has R, O, A, S, T. It avoids C,N,E. But note:
   Position 1: R -> we are testing R in position 1? Also, in the secret word, R might be in position 1? 
   Position 2: O -> new letter
   Position 3: A -> but we know from previous feedback that A cannot be in position 3! So that would be a bad choice because we know the secret word does not have A in position 3. 

 Therefore, we cannot try a word that has A in position 3? Or R in position 2? We must avoid the positions we know they are not.

 So ""ROAST"" is invalid for this because A is forced into position 3? But we know it's not in position 3. So we skip that.

 Alternatively, ""RATIO"": Has R at position 1, A at position 2, T, I, O. 
   Position 3: T -> unknown
   Position 4: I -> unknown
   Position 5: O -> unknown

 But we don't know if the secret word has T,I,O. And we avoid C,N,E.

 Alternatively, ""STAIR"": S,T,A,I,R. 
   Positions: 
     1: S
     2: T
     3: A -> we know A cannot be in position 3? So that's bad.

 How about ""TRIAL"": T,R,I,A,L? 
   Position 1: T
   Position 2: R -> but we know that R should not be in position 2? Because in the first guess R was in position 2 and it was wrong. So we must avoid R in position 2? Therefore, ""TRIAL"" is invalid.

 So we avoid both R in position 2 and A in position 3.

 Another idea: ""PARTY"": 
   P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)
   Now: 
      A is in position 2 -> not position 3? That's okay because the rule about A was only that it was wrong in position 3, but we don't know about other positions? 
      Similarly, R is in position 3 -> which is different from position 2? So that's okay.

 However, note: We don't know if position 3 is okay for R? The feedback only said that when R was in position 2 it was wrong. So R could be in position 3? Similarly, A is in position 2? It wasn't tested in position 2 before? Actually, we have no information about position 2 for A? Because the first guess had A only in position 3.

 Therefore, ""PARTY"" is a valid guess.

 Why is it valid?
   - It has A and R? (Yes)
   - A is in position 2? Which wasn't tested? So that might be correct? Or might be wrong? We don't know.
   - R is in position 3? Which we don't know? 

 We are testing R in a new position? And A in a new position? Also, introducing P, T, Y? 

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that places A and R in positions we haven't tested? But actually, we haven't tested any other positions? Only we know position 2 and position 3 in the first guess? 

 However, we have two letters that must be in the word: R and A. 

 I think ""PARTY"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters.

 Another candidate: ""STRAY"": 
   S (1), T (2), R (3), A (4), Y (5) 
   This avoids R in position 2 and A in position 3? Yes? 
   Also, the letters S,T,R,A,Y? All new? 

 How about ""TRAPS"": 
   T (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? Because first feedback said R is not in position 2? So that would be invalid.

 How about ""RADAR"": 
   R (1), A (2), D (3), A (4), R (5). 
   But note: the word has duplicate R and A? We don't know if the secret word has duplicates? We haven't been told? The rules don't say that the word has distinct letters? But Wordle typically allows repeated letters? So that's possible? 

 But note the feedback: In the first guess, each letter was evaluated independently? And we only know that the secret word must have at least one R and at least one A? It could have more? 

 However, to keep it simple, maybe we avoid duplicates for now? 

 Alternatively, let me think: We want to maximize information? 

 Considering the above, let me propose ""STRAY"".

 But note: we might have a problem? In ""STRAY"", the R is in position 3 and A is in position 4. 

 Other options: ""RAYON""? But ""RAYON"" has Y and O? But we haven't tested? But note: ""RAYON"" avoids C,N,E? But wait, N is eliminated? Oh, ""RAYON"" has N? Which we know is not in the word? Because first feedback said N is not in the word? -> So ""RAYON"" is invalid? Because it contains N? So we must avoid N?

 Therefore, we cannot choose ""RAYON"".

 Let me stick with ""STRAY"". 

 Now, ""STRAY"":
   S -> new, not tested? So it's safe? 
   T -> new?
   R -> we know is in the word? So we are testing R at position 3?
   A -> at position 4? 
   Y -> new.

 We don't have any constraints against position 3 for R? Or position 4 for A? Since the only constraints are R not at 2 and A not at 3? 

 So ""STRAY"" seems okay.

 Alternatively, ""PARTY"" also seems okay, but using P? 

 Since we don't know, I'm going to choose ""PARTY"" because it introduces P, T, Y? Which might be helpful? 

 But let me think: T is a common letter? 

 I'll go with ""PARTY"".

 So the guess is ""PARTY"".

   - The word contains A and R, but not in the positions we've tried so far.

 Specifically, from ""crane"":
     Position 2: R was wrong -> so R is not in position 2.
     Position 3: A was wrong -> so A is not in position 3.

 From ""party"":
     Position 2: A was wrong -> so A is not in position 2.
     Position 3: R was wrong -> so R is not in position 3.

 Therefore, we know:
   - A cannot be in position 2 or 3.
   - R cannot be in position 2 or 3.

 Since the word is 5 letters, the possible positions for A are 1, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, the possible positions for R are 1, 4, or 5.

 But note: we have two letters that must be placed in positions 1,4,5? And we have three positions? So they could be in two of these three positions? Or one of them might be in one and the other in another? 

 Also, we have eliminated 6 letters: C, N, E, P, T, Y.

 We still need to find the remaining three letters? Because the word has 5 letters and we know two of them (A and R), so three more.

 We haven't tested many letters. We can try to use other common letters.

 The remaining letters that are possible: 
   Alphabet without eliminated: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,Q,R,S,U,V,W,X,Z

 But note: we know A and R are in the word, so we are looking for three more from the above set.

 We also have constraints on the positions of A and R.

 Let me think of words that have A and R, and three other letters from the remaining, and place A and R in positions 1,4,5? But not in 2 or 3.

 Also, we must avoid the positions we know they are not? 

 Possibilities for A: positions 1,4,5
 Possibilities for R: positions 1,4,5

 But note: they cannot be in the same position? So if we put A in position 1, then R can be in 4 or 5? Similarly, if A in 4, R in 1 or 5? Etc.

 We need to test as many new letters as possible? 

 Let me try to form a word:

 Option 1: Put A in position 1? Then we can have a word like ""A _ _ _ R"" or ""A _ _ R _"", but note the positions for R: 4 or 5? 

 But we also have to fill the other positions? 

 Option 2: Put R in position 1? Then A in 4 or 5? 

 Since we don't know, we can try to test both? But we have to choose one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and R in positions 4 and 5? 

 Example: 
   If we put A in 4 and R in 5: then the word ends with ""AR"". 
   Or A in 5 and R in 4: then the word ends with ""RA"".

 We can also try to test common letters in the middle.

 Let me think of words that have A and R in the last two positions? 

 For example: 
   ""SOLAR"": S,O,L,A,R -> but note: A is in position 4, R in position 5? 
   But we haven't tested S, O, L? 

 However, we have to avoid the eliminated letters? S, O, L are not eliminated? 

 But wait: we have eliminated C,N,E,P,T,Y? So S, O, L are okay.

 But let's check the positions: 
   In ""SOLAR"": 
      Position 1: S
      Position 2: O
      Position 3: L
      Position 4: A -> which is allowed? Because A can be in 4? 
      Position 5: R -> allowed? 

 However, we also have to consider that we don't know if the secret word has S, O, L? 

 But we are testing them? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and R in the first and last? 

 Example: ""R _ _ A _"" -> R in 1 and A in 4? Then the word is R ? ? A ? 

 How about ""ROBOT""? But we have O and B? But note: we have eliminated T? So ""ROBOT"" has T? Which is eliminated? So not allowed.

 How about ""RADII""? But we have D and I? But also, we have A in position 2? But we know A cannot be in position 2? Because from the second guess, A was in position 2 and it was wrong? So we cannot put A in position 2? 

 Therefore, if we put R in position 1, then A must be in position 4 or 5? 

 Similarly, if we put A in position 1, then R must be in 4 or 5? 

 So let me try to form a word with R in position 1 and A in position 4? 

 Example: ""R _ _ A ?"" 

 We need to fill positions 2,3,5? 

 We can use common letters: S, L, O, etc.

 How about ""RULER""? But we have U, L, E? But E is eliminated? So not allowed.

 How about ""RIFLE""? But E is eliminated? 

 How about ""RUMBA""? 
   R (1), U (2), M (3), B (4), A (5) -> but then A is in position 5? And we are not using position 4? Actually, we have A in position 5? 
   But we also have B in position 4? 

 However, we are testing U, M, B? 

 But note: we have A in position 5? Which is allowed? 

 Alternatively, we can try ""RUMBA"" but then we are putting A in position 5? 

 But we also have to avoid the eliminated letters? U, M, B are not eliminated? 

 However, we have two letters to test? 

 But let me think: we have two confirmed letters: A and R? And we are introducing U, M, B? 

 But we have to consider: we know that the secret word has A and R? And we are placing R at 1 and A at 5? 

 But we don't know if that's correct? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and R in the last two positions? Like ""SOLAR"" as I thought earlier? 

 Let me check: ""SOLAR"" -> S,O,L,A,R? 
   S: not tested? 
   O: not tested?
   L: not tested?
   A: in position 4? 
   R: in position 5? 

 This seems good? 

 But we have to avoid the eliminated letters? Yes, S,O,L are not eliminated? 

 So I think ""SOLAR"" is a good candidate? 

 However, note: we have already tried R in position 3 in ""party"" and it was wrong? But in ""SOLAR"", R is in position 5? Which is new? 

 Similarly, A was in position 4? Which we haven't tried? 

 Also, we are testing three new letters: S, O, L? 

 But what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know? But we haven't seen any duplicates so far? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more common letters? 

 Another idea: ""SAVOR"": 
   S (1), A (2) -> but A in position 2? We know A cannot be in position 2? Because from ""party"", A was in position 2 and it was wrong? So that's invalid.

 How about ""AROMA""? 
   A (1), R (2) -> but R in position 2? We know R cannot be in position 2? Because from ""crane"", R was in position 2 and wrong? So invalid.

 How about ""AUDIO""? 
   A (1), U (2), D (3), I (4), O (5) -> but we don't have R? We must include R? Because we know R is in the word? So we cannot skip R? 

 Therefore, we must include both A and R? 

 So ""SOLAR"" seems a good choice? 

 But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters? 

 How about ""SHARD""? 
   S (1), H (2), A (3) -> but A in position 3? We know A cannot be in position 3? So invalid.

 How about ""FRAUD""? 
   F (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""BRAWL""? 
   B (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""CRAWL""? But C is eliminated? 

 How about ""DRAWL""? 
   D (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""GRASP""? 
   G (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""RASPY""? 
   R (1), A (2) -> but A in position 2? Not allowed? 

 So it's tricky? 

 Let me try to put A in position 1? 

 Example: ""A _ _ R _"" 

 How about ""ALARM""? 
   A (1), L (2), A (3) -> but we have A in position 3? We know A cannot be in position 3? So invalid? 

 How about ""AUDIO"" without R? Not allowed? 

 How about ""AORTA""? 
   A (1), O (2), R (3) -> but R in position 3? We know R cannot be in position 3? Because from ""party"", R was in position 3 and wrong? So invalid.

 How about ""AISLE""? But E is eliminated? 

 How about ""ALIKE""? But E and K? We haven't eliminated K? But E is eliminated? 

 How about ""ALIBI""? 
   A (1), L (2), I (3), B (4), I (5) -> but we don't have R? 

 We must include R? 

 How about ""AEGIS""? But E is eliminated? 

 So I think the best option is to put A and R in the last two positions? 

 Therefore, I choose ""SOLAR"". 

 But note: we have to make sure we are not repeating the same mistake? 

 In ""SOLAR"":
   Position 1: S -> new
   Position 2: O -> new
   Position 3: L -> new
   Position 4: A -> we are testing A in position 4? 
   Position 5: R -> we are testing R in position 5? 

 We know A cannot be in 2 or 3? So 4 is okay? 
 We know R cannot be in 2 or 3? So 5 is okay? 

 And we are testing three new letters? 

 So let's go with ""SOLAR"". 

 But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know? But we haven't seen any? 

 Alternatively, we can try ""LABOR"": 
   L (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""ROBIN"": but N is eliminated? 

 How about ""ROGUE"": but E is eliminated? 

 How about ""RADIO"": 
   R (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""RABID"": 
   R (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""RACER"": but C and E are eliminated? 

 So I think ""SOLAR"" is a good choice? 

 But let me check if there is a word that uses more common letters? 

 Another idea: ""SAUCE""? But C and E are eliminated? 

 How about ""SALAD""? 
   S (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""SALSA""? 
   S (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""SALON""? N eliminated? 

 How about ""SALVO"": 
   S (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""SABER"": E eliminated? 

 How about ""SABRA"": 
   S (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? 

 So I think we have to avoid position 2 for A? 

 Therefore, I will go with ""SOLAR"". 

 Guess: ""SOLAR""

 Format: <guess>solar</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Eliminated Letters**: C, N, E, P, T, Y (not in the word at all).
- **Confirmed Letters**: A and R are in the word, but their positions are incorrect in both prior guesses:
  - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from ""party"" and ""crane"" feedback).
  - R cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from ""crane"" and ""party"" feedback).
- **Remaining Possibilities**: A must be in position 1, 4, or 5; R must be in position 1, 4, or 5. The word has 3 additional unknown letters.

For this guess, I chose **""solar""** because:
- It places A in position 4 and R in position 5—both untested positions that fit the constraints.
- It tests 3 new common letters (S, O, L) to gather more information.
- It avoids all eliminated letters and adheres to positional rules.

<guess>solar</guess>",solar,"We are given feedback from the second guess ""party"":
 P(x) : P is not in the secret word.
 A(-) : A is in the secret word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2).
 R(-) : R is in the secret word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
 T(x) : T is not in the secret word.
 Y(x) : Y is not in the secret word.

 Now, combining with the first guess ""crane"" feedback:
   - C, N, E, P, T, Y are not in the word. (Eliminated letters: C, N, E, P, T, Y)
   - The word contains A and R, but not in the positions we've tried so far.

 Specifically, from ""crane"":
     Position 2: R was wrong -> so R is not in position 2.
     Position 3: A was wrong -> so A is not in position 3.

 From ""party"":
     Position 2: A was wrong -> so A is not in position 2.
     Position 3: R was wrong -> so R is not in position 3.

 Therefore, we know:
   - A cannot be in position 2 or 3.
   - R cannot be in position 2 or 3.

 Since the word is 5 letters, the possible positions for A are 1, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, the possible positions for R are 1, 4, or 5.

 But note: we have two letters that must be placed in positions 1,4,5? And we have three positions? So they could be in two of these three positions? Or one of them might be in one and the other in another? 

 Also, we have eliminated 6 letters: C, N, E, P, T, Y.

 We still need to find the remaining three letters? Because the word has 5 letters and we know two of them (A and R), so three more.

 We haven't tested many letters. We can try to use other common letters.

 The remaining letters that are possible: 
   Alphabet without eliminated: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,Q,R,S,U,V,W,X,Z

 But note: we know A and R are in the word, so we are looking for three more from the above set.

 We also have constraints on the positions of A and R.

 Let me think of words that have A and R, and three other letters from the remaining, and place A and R in positions 1,4,5? But not in 2 or 3.

 Also, we must avoid the positions we know they are not? 

 Possibilities for A: positions 1,4,5
 Possibilities for R: positions 1,4,5

 But note: they cannot be in the same position? So if we put A in position 1, then R can be in 4 or 5? Similarly, if A in 4, R in 1 or 5? Etc.

 But we also have to fill the other positions? 

 Option 2: Put R in position 1? Then A in 4 or 5? 

 Since we don't know, we can try to test both? But we have to choose one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and R in positions 4 and 5? 

 Example: 
   If we put A in 4 and R in 5: then the word ends with ""AR"". 
   Or A in 5 and R in 4: then the word ends with ""RA"".

 We can also try to test common letters in the middle.

 Let me think of words that have A and R in the last two positions? 

 For example: 
   ""SOLAR"": S,O,L,A,R -> but note: A is in position 4, R in position 5? 
   But we haven't tested S, O, L? 

 However, we have to avoid the eliminated letters? S, O, L are not eliminated? 

 But wait: we have eliminated C,N,E,P,T,Y? So S, O, L are okay.

 But let's check the positions: 
   In ""SOLAR"": 
      Position 1: S
      Position 2: O
      Position 3: L
      Position 4: A -> which is allowed? Because A can be in 4? 
      Position 5: R -> allowed? 

 However, we also have to consider that we don't know if the secret word has S, O, L? 

 But we are testing them? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and R in the first and last? 

 Example: ""R _ _ A _"" -> R in 1 and A in 4? Then the word is R ? ? A ? 

 How about ""ROBOT""? But we have O and B? But note: we have eliminated T? So ""ROBOT"" has T? Which is eliminated? So not allowed.

 How about ""RADII""? But we have D and I? But also, we have A in position 2? But we know A cannot be in position 2? Because from the second guess, A was in position 2 and it was wrong? So we cannot put A in position 2? 

 Therefore, if we put R in position 1, then A must be in position 4 or 5? 

 Similarly, if we put A in position 1, then R must be in 4 or 5? 

 So let me try to form a word with R in position 1 and A in position 4? 

 Example: ""R _ _ A ?"" 

 We need to fill positions 2,3,5? 

 We can use common letters: S, L, O, etc.

 How about ""RULER""? But we have U, L, E? But E is eliminated? So not allowed.

 How about ""RIFLE""? But E is eliminated? 

 How about ""RUMBA""?

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) : C is not in the secret word.
 R(-) : R is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
 A(-) : A is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
 N(x) : N is not in the secret word.
 E(x) : E is not in the secret word.

 So, we know the secret word contains R and A, but not C, N, or E.
 Also, R and A are not in the positions they were in the guess ""crane"". In ""crane"", R was the second letter and A was the third.

 Since R was in the second position in the guess and it's marked wrong position, that means R is either in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 in the secret word? Let me note the positions:
 Position 1: C -> x
 Position 2: R -> - (so R is in the word but not in position 2)
 Position 3: A -> - (so A is in the word but not in position 3)
 Position 4: N -> x
 Position 5: E -> x

 We know the word has 5 letters and must contain R and A, but exclude C, N, E.

 Also, since R and A are present but in wrong positions, let us try to think of words that have R and A, without C, N, E.

 Now, we have to make a second guess. We want a word that:
   - Does not contain R in position 2 or A in position 3.
   - Does not contain C, N, E at all.

 Additionally, we might want to reuse other letters to test for more common consonants? But note: we don't know what other letters might be in the word.

 Since we know A is in the word, let's try to place A in a different position. Similarly for R.

 Possibilities for R: We can try putting R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, any except 2.
 Similarly, A: any except 3.

 We also don't know other letters. So, we can try a word that includes other common letters not yet tested? Such as T, S, L, etc.

 Important: We must avoid C, N, E.

 Let's think of words that have R, A, and maybe some new letters.

 Since we have only eliminated three letters (C, N, E) and the word has five letters, we have many possibilities.

 We can try a word with R in the first position? But note: if we put R in the first position, then we might get more information quickly.

 Some common words: 

 Example: ""RATIO""? But we don't know if O, I, T are in the word. Also, note that we haven't tested I, O, T. But wait, A is in ""RATIO"" and it's in position 2? We cannot have A in position 3? Actually, in ""RATIO"", A is in position 2. We don't know about position 2 for A yet? Only that in the previous guess A was in position 3 and that was wrong. So A might be in position 2? 

 However, the feedback only said that when A was in position 3 it was wrong. So A could be in position 2? Similarly, R was in position 2 and that was wrong, but R could be in any other position.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that puts A in position 1 and R in position 4 or 5? 

 Let me compile a list of common letters that we haven't eliminated: the alphabet without C, N, E: 
 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ without C, N, E -> leaves: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

 We know A and R are in the word. So we need to guess with A and R, plus three other letters that we haven't tried.

 We haven't tried many. We can try:

 Let me think of words that have A and R and avoid C,N,E.

 Possible words: 
   - ""PARTY"": has P,A,R,T,Y -> avoids C,N,E.
   - ""FARTS"": avoids C,N,E? But we might not want to guess that... 
   - ""STARK"": S,T,A,R,K -> avoids C,N,E.

 Alternatively, we can try to use different positions.

 We have:
   - Position 2: we now know it's not R? But we don't know what is in position two? Actually, we know that the secret word has A and R, and the first guess had C in position 1 which was wrong.

 Another idea: We also know that in the first guess, the letter in position 1 was incorrect (so not C), position 2 was R but wrong (so the secret word does not have R at position 2), position 3 was A but wrong (so secret word does not have A at position 3), position 4 was N (wrong and not in the word) and position 5 was E (wrong and not in the word).

 Let me think of a word that has:
   - R in position 1,4, or 5? 
   - A in position 1,2,4, or 5? 

 And we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Option: ""ROAST"": This word has R, O, A, S, T. It avoids C,N,E. But note:
   Position 1: R -> we are testing R in position 1? Also, in the secret word, R might be in position 1? 
   Position 2: O -> new letter
   Position 3: A -> but we know from previous feedback that A cannot be in position 3! So that would be a bad choice because we know the secret word does not have A in position 3. 

 Therefore, we cannot try a word that has A in position 3? Or R in position 2? We must avoid the positions we know they are not.

 So ""ROAST"" is invalid for this because A is forced into position 3? But we know it's not in position 3. So we skip that.

 Alternatively, ""RATIO"": Has R at position 1, A at position 2, T, I, O. 
   Position 3: T -> unknown
   Position 4: I -> unknown
   Position 5: O -> unknown

 But we don't know if the secret word has T,I,O. And we avoid C,N,E.

 Alternatively, ""STAIR"": S,T,A,I,R. 
   Positions: 
     1: S
     2: T
     3: A -> we know A cannot be in position 3? So that's bad.

 How about ""TRIAL"": T,R,I,A,L? 
   Position 1: T
   Position 2: R -> but we know that R should not be in position 2? Because in the first guess R was in position 2 and it was wrong. So we must avoid R in position 2? Therefore, ""TRIAL"" is invalid.

 So we avoid both R in position 2 and A in position 3.

 Another idea: ""PARTY"": 
   P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)
   Now: 
      A is in position 2 -> not position 3? That's okay because the rule about A was only that it was wrong in position 3, but we don't know about other positions? 
      Similarly, R is in position 3 -> which is different from position 2? So that's okay.

 However, note: We don't know if position 3 is okay for R? The feedback only said that when R was in position 2 it was wrong. So R could be in position 3? Similarly, A is in position 2? It wasn't tested in position 2 before? Actually, we have no information about position 2 for A? Because the first guess had A only in position 3.

 Therefore, ""PARTY"" is a valid guess.

 Why is it valid?
   - It has A and R? (Yes)
   - A is in position 2? Which wasn't tested? So that might be correct? Or might be wrong? We don't know.
   - R is in position 3? Which we don't know? 

 We are testing R in a new position? And A in a new position? Also, introducing P, T, Y? 

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that places A and R in positions we haven't tested? But actually, we haven't tested any other positions? Only we know position 2 and position 3 in the first guess? 

 However, we have two letters that must be in the word: R and A. 

 I think ""PARTY"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters.

 Another candidate: ""STRAY"": 
   S (1), T (2), R (3), A (4), Y (5) 
   This avoids R in position 2 and A in position 3? Yes? 
   Also, the letters S,T,R,A,Y? All new? 

 How about ""TRAPS"": 
   T (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? Because first feedback said R is not in position 2? So that would be invalid.

 How about ""RADAR"": 
   R (1), A (2), D (3), A (4), R (5). 
   But note: the word has duplicate R and A? We don't know if the secret word has duplicates? We haven't been told? The rules don't say that the word has distinct letters? But Wordle typically allows repeated letters? So that's possible? 

 But note the feedback: In the first guess, each letter was evaluated independently? And we only know that the secret word must have at least one R and at least one A? It could have more? 

 However, to keep it simple, maybe we avoid duplicates for now? 

 Alternatively, let me think: We want to maximize information? 

 Considering the above, let me propose ""STRAY"".

 But note: we might have a problem? In ""STRAY"", the R is in position 3 and A is in position 4. 

 Other options: ""RAYON""? But ""RAYON"" has Y and O? But we haven't tested? But note: ""RAYON"" avoids C,N,E? But wait, N is eliminated? Oh, ""RAYON"" has N? Which we know is not in the word? Because first feedback said N is not in the word? -> So ""RAYON"" is invalid? Because it contains N? So we must avoid N?

 Therefore, we cannot choose ""RAYON"".

 Let me stick with ""STRAY"". 

 Now, ""STRAY"":
   S -> new, not tested? So it's safe? 
   T -> new?
   R -> we know is in the word? So we are testing R at position 3?
   A -> at position 4? 
   Y -> new.

 We don't have any constraints against position 3 for R? Or position 4 for A? Since the only constraints are R not at 2 and A not at 3? 

 So ""STRAY"" seems okay.

 Alternatively, ""PARTY"" also seems okay, but using P? 

 Since we don't know, I'm going to choose ""PARTY"" because it introduces P, T, Y? Which might be helpful? 

 But let me think: T is a common letter? 

 I'll go with ""PARTY"".

 So the guess is ""PARTY"".

 Format: <guess>party</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- R and A **are** in the secret word, but they were in incorrect positions (R was position 2, A was position 3).

For my next guess:
- Must include R and A (since they are confirmed in the word).
- Avoid C, N, E entirely.
- Position R anywhere except position 2 (since feedback showed R is not in position 2).
- Position A anywhere except position 3 (since feedback showed A is not in position 3).
- Test new common consonants like T, P, and Y to gather more information.

I chose **""party""**:
- P (position 1): Untested letter to probe potential positions.
- A (position 2): Tests A in a new position given it can't be position 3.
- R (position 3): Tests R in a new position given it can't be position 2.
- T (position 4): Untested letter.
- Y (position 5): Untested letter.

This maximizes information by testing A/R in new positions while introducing 3 new letters (P, T, Y).

<guess>party</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) R(-) T(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the second guess ""party"":
 P(x) : P is not in the secret word.
 A(-) : A is in the secret word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2).
 R(-) : R is in the secret word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
 T(x) : T is not in the secret word.
 Y(x) : Y is not in the secret word.

 Now, combining with the first guess ""crane"" feedback:
   - C, N, E, P, T, Y are not in the word. (Eliminated letters: C, N, E, P, T, Y)
   - The word contains A and R, but not in the positions we've tried so far.

 Specifically, from ""crane"":
     Position 2: R was wrong -> so R is not in position 2.
     Position 3: A was wrong -> so A is not in position 3.

 From ""party"":
     Position 2: A was wrong -> so A is not in position 2.
     Position 3: R was wrong -> so R is not in position 3.

 Therefore, we know:
   - A cannot be in position 2 or 3.
   - R cannot be in position 2 or 3.

 Since the word is 5 letters, the possible positions for A are 1, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, the possible positions for R are 1, 4, or 5.

 But note: we have two letters that must be placed in positions 1,4,5? And we have three positions? So they could be in two of these three positions? Or one of them might be in one and the other in another? 

 Also, we have eliminated 6 letters: C, N, E, P, T, Y.

 We still need to find the remaining three letters? Because the word has 5 letters and we know two of them (A and R), so three more.

 We haven't tested many letters. We can try to use other common letters.

 The remaining letters that are possible: 
   Alphabet without eliminated: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,Q,R,S,U,V,W,X,Z

 But note: we know A and R are in the word, so we are looking for three more from the above set.

 We also have constraints on the positions of A and R.

 Let me think of words that have A and R, and three other letters from the remaining, and place A and R in positions 1,4,5? But not in 2 or 3.

 Also, we must avoid the positions we know they are not? 

 Possibilities for A: positions 1,4,5
 Possibilities for R: positions 1,4,5

 But note: they cannot be in the same position? So if we put A in position 1, then R can be in 4 or 5? Similarly, if A in 4, R in 1 or 5? Etc.

 We need to test as many new letters as possible? 

 Let me try to form a word:

 Option 1: Put A in position 1? Then we can have a word like ""A _ _ _ R"" or ""A _ _ R _"", but note the positions for R: 4 or 5? 

 But we also have to fill the other positions? 

 Option 2: Put R in position 1? Then A in 4 or 5? 

 Since we don't know, we can try to test both? But we have to choose one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and R in positions 4 and 5? 

 Example: 
   If we put A in 4 and R in 5: then the word ends with ""AR"". 
   Or A in 5 and R in 4: then the word ends with ""RA"".

 We can also try to test common letters in the middle.

 Let me think of words that have A and R in the last two positions? 

 For example: 
   ""SOLAR"": S,O,L,A,R -> but note: A is in position 4, R in position 5? 
   But we haven't tested S, O, L? 

 However, we have to avoid the eliminated letters? S, O, L are not eliminated? 

 But wait: we have eliminated C,N,E,P,T,Y? So S, O, L are okay.

 But let's check the positions: 
   In ""SOLAR"": 
      Position 1: S
      Position 2: O
      Position 3: L
      Position 4: A -> which is allowed? Because A can be in 4? 
      Position 5: R -> allowed? 

 However, we also have to consider that we don't know if the secret word has S, O, L? 

 But we are testing them? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and R in the first and last? 

 Example: ""R _ _ A _"" -> R in 1 and A in 4? Then the word is R ? ? A ? 

 How about ""ROBOT""? But we have O and B? But note: we have eliminated T? So ""ROBOT"" has T? Which is eliminated? So not allowed.

 How about ""RADII""? But we have D and I? But also, we have A in position 2? But we know A cannot be in position 2? Because from the second guess, A was in position 2 and it was wrong? So we cannot put A in position 2? 

 Therefore, if we put R in position 1, then A must be in position 4 or 5? 

 Similarly, if we put A in position 1, then R must be in 4 or 5? 

 So let me try to form a word with R in position 1 and A in position 4? 

 Example: ""R _ _ A ?"" 

 We need to fill positions 2,3,5? 

 We can use common letters: S, L, O, etc.

 How about ""RULER""? But we have U, L, E? But E is eliminated? So not allowed.

 How about ""RIFLE""? But E is eliminated? 

 How about ""RUMBA""? 
   R (1), U (2), M (3), B (4), A (5) -> but then A is in position 5? And we are not using position 4? Actually, we have A in position 5? 
   But we also have B in position 4? 

 However, we are testing U, M, B? 

 But note: we have A in position 5? Which is allowed? 

 Alternatively, we can try ""RUMBA"" but then we are putting A in position 5? 

 But we also have to avoid the eliminated letters? U, M, B are not eliminated? 

 However, we have two letters to test? 

 But let me think: we have two confirmed letters: A and R? And we are introducing U, M, B? 

 But we have to consider: we know that the secret word has A and R? And we are placing R at 1 and A at 5? 

 But we don't know if that's correct? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and R in the last two positions? Like ""SOLAR"" as I thought earlier? 

 Let me check: ""SOLAR"" -> S,O,L,A,R? 
   S: not tested? 
   O: not tested?
   L: not tested?
   A: in position 4? 
   R: in position 5? 

 This seems good? 

 But we have to avoid the eliminated letters? Yes, S,O,L are not eliminated? 

 So I think ""SOLAR"" is a good candidate? 

 However, note: we have already tried R in position 3 in ""party"" and it was wrong? But in ""SOLAR"", R is in position 5? Which is new? 

 Similarly, A was in position 4? Which we haven't tried? 

 Also, we are testing three new letters: S, O, L? 

 But what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know? But we haven't seen any duplicates so far? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more common letters? 

 Another idea: ""SAVOR"": 
   S (1), A (2) -> but A in position 2? We know A cannot be in position 2? Because from ""party"", A was in position 2 and it was wrong? So that's invalid.

 How about ""AROMA""? 
   A (1), R (2) -> but R in position 2? We know R cannot be in position 2? Because from ""crane"", R was in position 2 and wrong? So invalid.

 How about ""AUDIO""? 
   A (1), U (2), D (3), I (4), O (5) -> but we don't have R? We must include R? Because we know R is in the word? So we cannot skip R? 

 Therefore, we must include both A and R? 

 So ""SOLAR"" seems a good choice? 

 But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters? 

 How about ""SHARD""? 
   S (1), H (2), A (3) -> but A in position 3? We know A cannot be in position 3? So invalid.

 How about ""FRAUD""? 
   F (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""BRAWL""? 
   B (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""CRAWL""? But C is eliminated? 

 How about ""DRAWL""? 
   D (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""GRASP""? 
   G (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""RASPY""? 
   R (1), A (2) -> but A in position 2? Not allowed? 

 So it's tricky? 

 Let me try to put A in position 1? 

 Example: ""A _ _ R _"" 

 How about ""ALARM""? 
   A (1), L (2), A (3) -> but we have A in position 3? We know A cannot be in position 3? So invalid? 

 How about ""AUDIO"" without R? Not allowed? 

 How about ""AORTA""? 
   A (1), O (2), R (3) -> but R in position 3? We know R cannot be in position 3? Because from ""party"", R was in position 3 and wrong? So invalid.

 How about ""AISLE""? But E is eliminated? 

 How about ""ALIKE""? But E and K? We haven't eliminated K? But E is eliminated? 

 How about ""ALIBI""? 
   A (1), L (2), I (3), B (4), I (5) -> but we don't have R? 

 We must include R? 

 How about ""AEGIS""? But E is eliminated? 

 So I think the best option is to put A and R in the last two positions? 

 Therefore, I choose ""SOLAR"". 

 But note: we have to make sure we are not repeating the same mistake? 

 In ""SOLAR"":
   Position 1: S -> new
   Position 2: O -> new
   Position 3: L -> new
   Position 4: A -> we are testing A in position 4? 
   Position 5: R -> we are testing R in position 5? 

 We know A cannot be in 2 or 3? So 4 is okay? 
 We know R cannot be in 2 or 3? So 5 is okay? 

 And we are testing three new letters? 

 So let's go with ""SOLAR"". 

 But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know? But we haven't seen any? 

 Alternatively, we can try ""LABOR"": 
   L (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""ROBIN"": but N is eliminated? 

 How about ""ROGUE"": but E is eliminated? 

 How about ""RADIO"": 
   R (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""RABID"": 
   R (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""RACER"": but C and E are eliminated? 

 So I think ""SOLAR"" is a good choice? 

 But let me check if there is a word that uses more common letters? 

 Another idea: ""SAUCE""? But C and E are eliminated? 

 How about ""SALAD""? 
   S (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""SALSA""? 
   S (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""SALON""? N eliminated? 

 How about ""SALVO"": 
   S (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""SABER"": E eliminated? 

 How about ""SABRA"": 
   S (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? 

 So I think we have to avoid position 2 for A? 

 Therefore, I will go with ""SOLAR"". 

 Guess: ""SOLAR""

 Format: <guess>solar</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Eliminated Letters**: C, N, E, P, T, Y (not in the word at all).
- **Confirmed Letters**: A and R are in the word, but their positions are incorrect in both prior guesses:
  - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from ""party"" and ""crane"" feedback).
  - R cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from ""crane"" and ""party"" feedback).
- **Remaining Possibilities**: A must be in position 1, 4, or 5; R must be in position 1, 4, or 5. The word has 3 additional unknown letters.

For this guess, I chose **""solar""** because:
- It places A in position 4 and R in position 5—both untested positions that fit the constraints.
- It tests 3 new common letters (S, O, L) to gather more information.
- It avoids all eliminated letters and adheres to positional rules.

We can try:\n\n Let me think of words that have A and R and avoid C,N,E.\n\n Possible words: \n   - ""PARTY"": has P,A,R,T,Y -> avoids C,N,E.\n   - ""FARTS"": avoids C,N,E? But we might not want to guess that... \n   - ""STARK"": S,T,A,R,K -> avoids C,N,E.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to use different positions.\n\n We have:\n   - Position 2: we now know it\'s not R? But we don\'t know what is in position two? Actually, we know that the secret word has A and R, and the first guess had C in position 1 which was wrong.\n\n Another idea: We also know that in the first guess, the letter in position 1 was incorrect (so not C), position 2 was R but wrong (so the secret word does not have R at position 2), position 3 was A but wrong (so secret word does not have A at position 3), position 4 was N (wrong and not in the word) and position 5 was E (wrong and not in the word).\n\n Let me think of a word that has:\n   - R in position 1,4, or 5? \n   - A in position 1,2,4, or 5? \n\n And we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Option: ""ROAST"": This word has R, O, A, S, T. It avoids C,N,E. But note:\n   Position 1: R -> we are testing R in position 1? Also, in the secret word, R might be in position 1? \n   Position 2: O -> new letter\n   Position 3: A -> but we know from previous feedback that A cannot be in position 3! So that would be a bad choice because we know the secret word does not have A in position 3. \n\n Therefore, we cannot try a word that has A in position 3? Or R in position 2? We must avoid the positions we know they are not.\n\n So ""ROAST"" is invalid for this because A is forced into position 3? But we know it\'s not in position 3. So we skip that.\n\n Alternatively, ""RATIO"": Has R at position 1, A at position 2, T, I, O. \n   Position 3: T -> unknown\n   Position 4: I -> unknown\n   Position 5: O -> unknown\n\n But we don\'t know if the secret word has T,I,O. And we avoid C,N,E.\n\n Alternatively, ""STAIR"": S,T,A,I,R. \n   Positions: \n     1: S\n     2: T\n     3: A -> we know A cannot be in position 3? So that\'s bad.\n\n How about ""TRIAL"": T,R,I,A,L? \n   Position 1: T\n   Position 2: R -> but we know that R should not be in position 2? Because in the first guess R was in position 2 and it was wrong. So we must avoid R in position 2? Therefore, ""TRIAL"" is invalid.\n\n So we avoid both R in position 2 and A in position 3.\n\n Another idea: ""PARTY"": \n   P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)\n   Now: \n      A is in position 2 -> not position 3? That\'s okay because the rule about A was only that it was wrong in position 3, but we don\'t know about other positions? \n      Similarly, R is in position 3 -> which is different from position 2? So that\'s okay.\n\n However, note: We don\'t know if position 3 is okay for R? The feedback only said that when R was in position 2 it was wrong. So R could be in position 3? Similarly, A is in position 2? It wasn\'t tested in position 2 before? Actually, we have no information about position 2 for A? Because the first guess had A only in position 3.\n\n Therefore, ""PARTY"" is a valid guess.\n\n Why is it valid?\n   - It has A and R? (Yes)\n   - A is in position 2? Which wasn\'t tested? So that might be correct? Or might be wrong? We don\'t know.\n   - R is in position 3? Which we don\'t know? \n\n We are testing R in a new position? And A in a new position? Also, introducing P, T, Y? \n\n Alternatively, we could choose a word that places A and R in positions we haven\'t tested? But actually, we haven\'t tested any other positions? Only we know position 2 and position 3 in the first guess? \n\n However, we have two letters that must be in the word: R and A. \n\n I think ""PARTY"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""STRAY"": \n   S (1), T (2), R (3), A (4), Y (5) \n   This avoids R in position 2 and A in position 3? Yes? \n   Also, the letters S,T,R,A,Y? All new? \n\n How about ""TRAPS"": \n   T (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? Because first feedback said R is not in position 2? So that would be invalid.\n\n How about ""RADAR"": \n   R (1), A (2), D (3), A (4), R (5). \n   But note: the word has duplicate R and A? We don\'t know if the secret word has duplicates? We haven\'t been told? The rules don\'t say that the word has distinct letters? But Wordle typically allows repeated letters? So that\'s possible? \n\n But note the feedback: In the first guess, each letter was evaluated independently? And we only know that the secret word must have at least one R and at least one A? It could have more? \n\n However, to keep it simple, maybe we avoid duplicates for now? \n\n Alternatively, let me think: We want to maximize information? \n\n Considering the above, let me propose ""STRAY"".\n\n But note: we might have a problem? In ""STRAY"", the R is in position 3 and A is in position 4. \n\n Other options: ""RAYON""? But ""RAYON"" has Y and O? But we haven\'t tested? But note: ""RAYON"" avoids C,N,E? But wait, N is eliminated? Oh, ""RAYON"" has N? Which we know is not in the word? Because first feedback said N is not in the word? -> So ""RAYON"" is invalid? Because it contains N? So we must avoid N?\n\n Therefore, we cannot choose ""RAYON"".\n\n Let me stick with ""STRAY"". \n\n Now, ""STRAY"":\n   S -> new, not tested? So it\'s safe? \n   T -> new?\n   R -> we know is in the word? So we are testing R at position 3?\n   A -> at position 4? \n   Y -> new.\n\n We don\'t have any constraints against position 3 for R? Or position 4 for A? Since the only constraints are R not at 2 and A not at 3? \n\n So ""STRAY"" seems okay.\n\n Alternatively, ""PARTY"" also seems okay, but using P? \n\n Since we don\'t know, I\'m going to choose ""PARTY"" because it introduces P, T, Y? Which might be helpful? \n\n But let me think: T is a common letter? \n\n I\'ll go with ""PARTY"".\n\n So the guess is ""PARTY"".\n\n Format: <guess>party</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.\n- R and A **are** in the secret word, but they were in incorrect positions (R was position 2, A was position 3).\n\nFor my next guess:\n- Must include R and A (since they are confirmed in the word).\n- Avoid C, N, E entirely.\n- Position R anywhere except position 2 (since feedback showed R is not in position 2).\n- Position A anywhere except position 3 (since feedback showed A is not in position 3).\n- Test new common consonants like T, P, and Y to gather more information.\n\nI chose **""party""**:\n- P (position 1): Untested letter to probe potential positions.\n- A (position 2): Tests A in a new position given it can\'t be position 3.\n- R (position 3): Tests R in a new position given it can\'t be position 2.\n- T (position 4): Untested letter.\n- Y (position 5): Untested letter.\n\nThis maximizes information by testing A/R in new positions while introducing 3 new letters (P, T, Y).\n\n<guess>party</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) R(-) T(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the second guess ""party"":\n P(x) : P is not in the secret word.\n A(-) : A is in the secret word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2).\n R(-) : R is in the secret word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).\n T(x) : T is not in the secret word.\n Y(x) : Y is not in the secret word.\n\n Now, combining with the first guess ""crane"" feedback:\n   - C, N, E, P, T, Y are not in the word. (Eliminated letters: C, N, E, P, T, Y)\n   - The word contains A and R, but not in the positions we\'ve tried so far.\n\n Specifically, from ""crane"":\n     Position 2: R was wrong -> so R is not in position 2.\n     Position 3: A was wrong -> so A is not in position 3.\n\n From ""party"":\n     Position 2: A was wrong -> so A is not in position 2.\n     Position 3: R was wrong -> so R is not in position 3.\n\n Therefore, we know:\n   - A cannot be in position 2 or 3.\n   - R cannot be in position 2 or 3.\n\n Since the word is 5 letters, the possible positions for A are 1, 4, or 5.\n Similarly, the possible positions for R are 1, 4, or 5.\n\n But note: we have two letters that must be placed in positions 1,4,5? And we have three positions? So they could be in two of these three positions? Or one of them might be in one and the other in another? \n\n Also, we have eliminated 6 letters: C, N, E, P, T, Y.\n\n We still need to find the remaining three letters? Because the word has 5 letters and we know two of them (A and R), so three more.\n\n We haven\'t tested many letters. We can try to use other common letters.\n\n The remaining letters that are possible: \n   Alphabet without eliminated: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,Q,R,S,U,V,W,X,Z\n\n But note: we know A and R are in the word, so we are looking for three more from the above set.\n\n We also have constraints on the positions of A and R.\n\n Let me think of words that have A and R, and three other letters from the remaining, and place A and R in positions 1,4,5? But not in 2 or 3.\n\n Also, we must avoid the positions we know they are not? \n\n Possibilities for A: positions 1,4,5\n Possibilities for R: positions 1,4,5\n\n But note: they cannot be in the same position? So if we put A in position 1, then R can be in 4 or 5? Similarly, if A in 4, R in 1 or 5? Etc.\n\n We need to test as many new letters as possible? \n\n Let me try to form a word:\n\n Option 1: Put A in position 1? Then we can have a word like ""A _ _ _ R"" or ""A _ _ R _"", but note the positions for R: 4 or 5? \n\n But we also have to fill the other positions? \n\n Option 2: Put R in position 1? Then A in 4 or 5? \n\n Since we don\'t know, we can try to test both? But we have to choose one.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and R in positions 4 and 5? \n\n Example: \n   If we put A in 4 and R in 5: then the word ends with ""AR"". \n   Or A in 5 and R in 4: then the word ends with ""RA"".\n\n We can also try to test common letters in the middle.\n\n Let me think of words that have A and R in the last two positions? \n\n For example: \n   ""SOLAR"": S,O,L,A,R -> but note: A is in position 4, R in position 5? \n   But we haven\'t tested S, O, L? \n\n However, we have to avoid the eliminated letters? S, O, L are not eliminated? \n\n But wait: we have eliminated C,N,E,P,T,Y? So S, O, L are okay.\n\n But let\'s check the positions: \n   In ""SOLAR"": \n      Position 1: S\n      Position 2: O\n      Position 3: L\n      Position 4: A -> which is allowed? Because A can be in 4? \n      Position 5: R -> allowed? \n\n However, we also have to consider that we don\'t know if the secret word has S, O, L? \n\n But we are testing them? \n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and R in the first and last? \n\n Example: ""R _ _ A _"" -> R in 1 and A in 4? Then the word is R ? ? A ? \n\n How about ""ROBOT""? But we have O and B? But note: we have eliminated T? So ""ROBOT"" has T? Which is eliminated? So not allowed.\n\n How about ""RADII""? But we have D and I? But also, we have A in position 2? But we know A cannot be in position 2? Because from the second guess, A was in position 2 and it was wrong? So we cannot put A in position 2? \n\n Therefore, if we put R in position 1, then A must be in position 4 or 5? \n\n Similarly, if we put A in position 1, then R must be in 4 or 5? \n\n So let me try to form a word with R in position 1 and A in position 4? \n\n Example: ""R _ _ A ?"" \n\n We need to fill positions 2,3,5? \n\n We can use common letters: S, L, O, etc.\n\n How about ""RULER""? But we have U, L, E? But E is eliminated? So not allowed.\n\n How about ""RIFLE""? But E is eliminated? \n\n How about ""RUMBA""? \n   R (1), U (2), M (3), B (4), A (5) -> but then A is in position 5? And we are not using position 4? Actually, we have A in position 5? \n   But we also have B in position 4? \n\n However, we are testing U, M, B? \n\n But note: we have A in position 5? Which is allowed? \n\n Alternatively, we can try ""RUMBA"" but then we are putting A in position 5? \n\n But we also have to avoid the eliminated letters? U, M, B are not eliminated? \n\n However, we have two letters to test? \n\n But let me think: we have two confirmed letters: A and R? And we are introducing U, M, B? \n\n But we have to consider: we know that the secret word has A and R? And we are placing R at 1 and A at 5? \n\n But we don\'t know if that\'s correct? \n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and R in the last two positions? Like ""SOLAR"" as I thought earlier? \n\n Let me check: ""SOLAR"" -> S,O,L,A,R? \n   S: not tested? \n   O: not tested?\n   L: not tested?\n   A: in position 4? \n   R: in position 5? \n\n This seems good? \n\n But we have to avoid the eliminated letters? Yes, S,O,L are not eliminated? \n\n So I think ""SOLAR"" is a good candidate? \n\n However, note: we have already tried R in position 3 in ""party"" and it was wrong? But in ""SOLAR"", R is in position 5? Which is new? \n\n Similarly, A was in position 4? Which we haven\'t tried? \n\n Also, we are testing three new letters: S, O, L? \n\n But what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don\'t know? But we haven\'t seen any duplicates so far? \n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more common letters? \n\n Another idea: ""SAVOR"": \n   S (1), A (2) -> but A in position 2? We know A cannot be in position 2? Because from ""party"", A was in position 2 and it was wrong? So that\'s invalid.\n\n How about ""AROMA""? \n   A (1), R (2) -> but R in position 2? We know R cannot be in position 2? Because from ""crane"", R was in position 2 and wrong? So invalid.\n\n How about ""AUDIO""? \n   A (1), U (2), D (3), I (4), O (5) -> but we don\'t have R? We must include R? Because we know R is in the word? So we cannot skip R? \n\n Therefore, we must include both A and R? \n\n So ""SOLAR"" seems a good choice? \n\n But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters? \n\n How about ""SHARD""? \n   S (1), H (2), A (3) -> but A in position 3? We know A cannot be in position 3? So invalid.\n\n How about ""FRAUD""? \n   F (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? \n\n How about ""BRAWL""? \n   B (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? \n\n How about ""CRAWL""? But C is eliminated? \n\n How about ""DRAWL""? \n   D (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? \n\n How about ""GRASP""? \n   G (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? \n\n How about ""RASPY""? \n   R (1), A (2) -> but A in position 2? Not allowed? \n\n So it\'s tricky? \n\n Let me try to put A in position 1? \n\n Example: ""A _ _ R _"" \n\n How about ""ALARM""? \n   A (1), L (2), A (3) -> but we have A in position 3? We know A cannot be in position 3? So invalid? \n\n How about ""AUDIO"" without R? Not allowed? \n\n How about ""AORTA""? \n   A (1), O (2), R (3) -> but R in position 3? We know R cannot be in position 3? Because from ""party"", R was in position 3 and wrong? So invalid.\n\n How about ""AISLE""? But E is eliminated? \n\n How about ""ALIKE""? But E and K? We haven\'t eliminated K? But E is eliminated? \n\n How about ""ALIBI""? \n   A (1), L (2), I (3), B (4), I (5) -> but we don\'t have R? \n\n We must include R? \n\n How about ""AEGIS""? But E is eliminated? \n\n So I think the best option is to put A and R in the last two positions? \n\n Therefore, I choose ""SOLAR"". \n\n But note: we have to make sure we are not repeating the same mistake? \n\n In ""SOLAR"":\n   Position 1: S -> new\n   Position 2: O -> new\n   Position 3: L -> new\n   Position 4: A -> we are testing A in position 4? \n   Position 5: R -> we are testing R in position 5? \n\n We know A cannot be in 2 or 3? So 4 is okay? \n We know R cannot be in 2 or 3? So 5 is okay? \n\n And we are testing three new letters? \n\n So let\'s go with ""SOLAR"". \n\n But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don\'t know? But we haven\'t seen any? \n\n Alternatively, we can try ""LABOR"": \n   L (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? \n\n How about ""ROBIN"": but N is eliminated? \n\n How about ""ROGUE"": but E is eliminated? \n\n How about ""RADIO"": \n   R (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? \n\n How about ""RABID"": \n   R (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? \n\n How about ""RACER"": but C and E are eliminated? \n\n So I think ""SOLAR"" is a good choice? \n\n But let me check if there is a word that uses more common letters? \n\n Another idea: ""SAUCE""? But C and E are eliminated? \n\n How about ""SALAD""? \n   S (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? \n\n How about ""SALSA""? \n   S (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? \n\n How about ""SALON""? N eliminated? \n\n How about ""SALVO"": \n   S (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? \n\n How about ""SABER"": E eliminated? \n\n How about ""SABRA"": \n   S (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? \n\n So I think we have to avoid position 2 for A? \n\n Therefore, I will go with ""SOLAR"". \n\n Guess: ""SOLAR""\n\n Format: <guess>solar</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Eliminated Letters**: C, N, E, P, T, Y (not in the word at all).\n- **Confirmed Letters**: A and R are in the word, but their positions are incorrect in both prior guesses:\n  - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from ""party"" and ""crane"" feedback).\n  - R cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from ""crane"" and ""party"" feedback).\n- **Remaining Possibilities**: A must be in position 1, 4, or 5; R must be in position 1, 4, or 5. The word has 3 additional unknown letters.\n\nFor this guess, I chose **""solar""** because:\n- It places A in position 4 and R in position 5—both untested positions that fit the constraints.\n- It tests 3 new common letters (S, O, L) to gather more information.\n- It avoids all eliminated letters and adheres to positional rules.\n\n<guess>solar</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) R(-) T(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: solar -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(-) L(-) A(-) R(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from the third guess ""solar"":
 S(x) : S is not in the secret word.
 O(-) : O is in the secret word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2).
 L(-) : L is in the secret word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
 A(-) : A is in the secret word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4).
 R(-) : R is in the secret word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5).

 Now, combining with previous feedback:

 Eliminated letters: C, N, E, P, T, Y, S (from this guess). So total eliminated: C, E, N, P, T, Y, S.

 Confirmed letters in the word: A, R (from before), and now also O and L are confirmed to be in the word.

 So the secret word contains: A, R, O, L. And one more letter? Because it's 5 letters? We have 4 confirmed: A, R, O, L. So there is one more letter to find.

 But note: the feedback for ""solar"" shows that all five letters in the guess are either not in the word (S) or in the word but wrong position (O, L, A, R). Since S is not in the word, we have O, L, A, R in the word? But we already knew A and R? Now we know O and L are also in the word? 

 However, wait: the word has 5 letters. We have 4 letters: A, R, O, L. So the fifth letter is missing? 

 But the feedback says that O, L, A, R are in the word? So the secret word must have at least these four? And one more? 

 But it could have duplicates? However, we have no indication of duplicates so far? 

 Alternatively, the secret word might have exactly these four and one duplicate? But we don't know.

 But let's assume for now that there are no duplicates? Then the secret word has 5 distinct letters: A, R, O, L, and one more.

 We also have positional constraints:

 From previous guesses:

 For A:
   - Not in position 2 (from ""party"" guess: A in position 2 was wrong)
   - Not in position 3 (from ""crane"" guess: A in position 3 was wrong)
   - Not in position 4 (from ""solar"" guess: A in position 4 was wrong)

 Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 5? (since positions 2,3,4 are ruled out)

 For R:
   - Not in position 2 (from ""crane"")
   - Not in position 3 (from ""party"")
   - Not in position 5 (from ""solar"": R in position 5 was wrong)

 Therefore, R must be in position 1 or 4? (positions 2,3,5 are ruled out)

 For O:
   - From ""solar"": O was in position 2 and it was wrong? So O is not in position 2.

 For L:
   - From ""solar"": L was in position 3 and it was wrong? So L is not in position 3.

 Now, we also know that the secret word has one more letter? Let's call it X? We don't know X.

 We need to form a 5-letter word with letters: A, R, O, L, X? Where X is a letter not eliminated? 

 Eliminated letters: C, E, N, P, T, Y, S.

 Available letters: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Z? But note: O is already in the word? So we are looking for one more letter? 

 But wait: the word must have 5 distinct letters? We don't know? But we haven't encountered duplicates? So let's assume distinct.

 Now, we have to assign positions:

 Positions: 1,2,3,4,5

 Constraints:
   A: position 1 or 5
   R: position 1 or 4
   O: not position 2
   L: not position 3

 Also, note: if R is in position 1, then A cannot be in position 1? So if R is in 1, then A must be in 5? 
   Similarly, if R is in 4, then A can be in 1 or 5? 

 But also, we have to place O and L and X.

 Let me consider the two cases for R:

 Case 1: R in position 1.
   Then A must be in position 5 (since A cannot be in 1 if R is there? And the only other option for A is 5).
   Then we have positions 2,3,4 to fill with O, L, and X.

   Constraints for O: not in 2? But we can put O in 3 or 4? 
   Constraints for L: not in 3? So L can be in 2 or 4? 

   But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters? 

   Also, we have to form a valid word.

   Example: R _ _ _ A

   We need to fill positions 2,3,4 with O, L, and X? 

   How about: R O L _ A? But then L is in position 3? But L cannot be in position 3? So that's invalid.

   How about: R O _ L A? Then O in position 2? But O cannot be in position 2? So that's invalid.

   How about: R L _ O A? 
        Position 2: L -> allowed? (L can be in 2? because we only know it cannot be in 3)
        Position 3: ? 
        Position 4: O -> allowed? (O can be in 4? because we only know it cannot be in 2)

   So we have R, L, ?, O, A.

   The word must be valid? What words are there? 

   Example: ""RULOA""? Not a word.

   How about ""RADIO""? But we have A and D? But D is not in the word? And we have O? But we have R in 1, A in 5? But in ""RADIO"", A is in 2? Not 5? 

   We need a word that ends with A? 

   Example: ""ROTLA""? Not a word.

   How about ""ROULA""? Not a word.

   How about ""RHYLA""? Not a word.

   This seems difficult? 

 Case 2: R in position 4.
   Then A can be in position 1 or 5.

   Subcase 2a: A in position 1.
        Word: A _ _ R ?

        The last position must be the fifth letter? But we have O, L, and X to place? 

        Positions: 
          1: A
          2: ? 
          3: ?
          4: R
          5: ?

        We have to place O, L, and X in positions 2,3,5? 

        Constraints: 
          O: not in 2? So O can be in 3 or 5?
          L: not in 3? So L can be in 2 or 5?

        Example: A L O R ? -> but then we have to put X in position 5? But we have only one spot? And we have two letters? Wait, no: we have three letters to place? But we have three positions? 

        Actually, we have to assign O, L, and X to positions 2,3,5? 

        How about: 
          Position 2: L? -> allowed? 
          Position 3: O? -> allowed? (O can be in 3? because we only know it cannot be in 2)
          Position 5: X? 

        But then we have a word: A L O R X? 

        But we need a valid word? 

        Example: ""ALOR X"" -> not a word? 

        How about: 
          Position 2: X (the unknown)
          Position 3: L? -> but L cannot be in 3? So invalid.

        How about:
          Position 2: X
          Position 3: O? -> allowed? 
          Position 5: L? -> allowed? 

        Then word: A X O R L? 

        Example: ""AXORL"" not a word.

        How about:
          Position 2: O? -> but O cannot be in 2? So invalid.

        How about:
          Position 2: L? -> allowed? 
          Position 3: X? 
          Position 5: O? -> allowed? 

        Word: A L X R O? 

        Example: ""ALXRO"" not a word.

        How about:
          Position 2: X
          Position 3: ? -> we have to put either O or L? But O can be in 3? and L cannot be in 3? So we put O in 3? 
          Position 5: L? 

        Word: A X O R L? -> not a word.

   Subcase 2b: A in position 5.
        Word: ? _ _ R A

        We have to fill positions 1,2,3 with O, L, and X? 

        Constraints:
          O: not in 2? So O can be in 1 or 3?
          L: not in 3? So L can be in 1 or 2?

        Example: 
          Position 1: O? -> allowed? 
          Position 2: L? -> allowed? (L can be in 2? because we only know it cannot be in 3)
          Position 3: X? 
          Then word: O L X R A? 

        Example: ""OLXRA"" not a word.

        How about:
          Position 1: L? 
          Position 2: O? -> but O cannot be in 2? So invalid.

        How about:
          Position 1: O? 
          Position 2: X? 
          Position 3: L? -> but L cannot be in 3? So invalid.

        How about:
          Position 1: X? 
          Position 2: O? -> invalid (O cannot be in 2)
          Position 3: L? -> invalid (L cannot be in 3)

        How about:
          Position 1: L? 
          Position 2: X? 
          Position 3: O? -> allowed? (O can be in 3? because we only know it cannot be in 2)

        Then word: L X O R A? 

        Example: ""LXORA"" not a word.

        How about:
          Position 1: O? 
          Position 2: L? -> allowed? 
          Position 3: X? 
          Then word: O L X R A? 

        Example: ""OLXRA"" not a word.

 This is getting difficult? Maybe we need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? 

 Alternatively, we might have missed that the secret word has only 4 distinct letters? For example, one letter repeated? 

 Let me reexamine the feedback.

 In the third guess ""solar"", we had:
   S (x) -> not in word
   O (-) -> in word, wrong position
   L (-) -> in word, wrong position
   A (-) -> in word, wrong position
   R (-) -> in word, wrong position

 This means that the secret word contains O, L, A, R? But it might have a duplicate of one of these? Or it might have a fifth letter that is one of these? 

 But note: we have five positions? And we have four letters? So there must be a duplicate? 

 Therefore, the secret word has at least one duplicate letter? 

 Which letter is duplicated? It could be A, R, O, or L? 

 Now, let's think about the first guess ""crane"": 
   C (x), R (-), A (-), N (x), E (x)

 And second guess ""party"":
   P (x), A (-), R (-), T (x), Y (x)

 In ""crane"", we had R and A? And in ""party"", we had A and R? And in ""solar"", we had O, L, A, R? 

 If there is a duplicate, then one of these letters appears twice? 

 How can we find out which one? 

 We can try to consider the positions again? 

 But we have constraints on positions? 

 Let me list the positions we know are invalid for each letter:

 A: cannot be in 2,3,4 (from positions in ""party"", ""crane"", ""solar"")
    So A must be in 1 or 5.

 R: cannot be in 2,3,5 (from ""crane"", ""party"", ""solar"")
    So R must be in 1 or 4.

 O: cannot be in 2 (from ""solar"")
    So O can be in 1,3,4,5.

 L: cannot be in 3 (from ""solar"")
    So L can be in 1,2,4,5.

 Now, if there is a duplicate, then one of these letters appears twice? 

 We have to form a word that has five letters from {A, R, O, L} with one duplicate? 

 The word must have exactly five letters? So one letter appears twice? 

 Let me try to assign positions:

 We have two cases for R: position 1 or 4.

 Case 1: R in position 1.
   Then A must be in position 5? (because A cannot be in 1 if R is there? and A can only be in 1 or 5? so 5)
   Then we have positions 2,3,4 to fill? 

   We have to use two of {O, L} and one duplicate of either A, R, O, or L? 

   But R is already used? And A is at the end? 

   So the duplicate could be R? But R is at position 1? Then we need another R? 
   Or duplicate of A? But A is at position 5? Then we need another A? 
   Or duplicate of O or L? 

   Let me try duplicate of O? Then we have two O's and one L? 

   Positions 2,3,4: we need to assign two O's and one L? 

   But constraints:
        O: not in 2? So O cannot be in position 2? 
        L: not in 3? 

   So if we put L in position 2? Then we can put O in 3 and 4? 
        Word: R (1), L (2), O (3), O (4), A (5) -> ""RLOOA""? Not a word.

   If we put L in position 4? Then we put O in 2? But O cannot be in 2? So invalid.

   If we put L in position 3? But L cannot be in 3? 

   So duplicate of O doesn't work.

   Duplicate of L? Then we have two L's and one O? 
        Positions 2,3,4: two L's and one O? 
        But L cannot be in 3? So we cannot put L in position 3? 
        So we must put L in positions 2 and 4? 
        Then O in position 3? 
        Word: R (1), L (2), O (3), L (4), A (5) -> ""RLOLA""? Not a word.

   Duplicate of A? Then we have two A's? But A is already in position 5? So we need another A in positions 2,3, or 4? 
        But A cannot be in 2,3,4? Because we have feedback that A is not in 2,3,4? 
        So impossible.

   Duplicate of R? Then we have two R's? One at position 1, and another in positions 2,3,4? 
        But R cannot be in 2 or 3? So it must be in position 4? 
        Then we have R at 1 and 4? 
        Then positions 2 and 3: we have to put O and L? 
        Constraints: 
            O: not in 2? So O must be in 3? 
            L: not in 3? So L must be in 2? 
        Word: R (1), L (2), O (3), R (4), A (5) -> ""RLORA""? Not a word.

 Case 2: R in position 4.
   Then A can be in 1 or 5.

   Subcase 2a: A in position 1.
        Word: A _ _ R ?
        Positions 2,3,5 to fill? (since position 4 is R)

        We have to use two of {O, L} and one duplicate? 

        The duplicate could be A, R, O, L.

        But A is at 1? So if duplicate of A, then we need another A? But A cannot be in 2,3,4? and 5 is available? But we have position 5 available? 
            So we could put A in position 5? But then we have two A's? 
            Then positions 2 and 3: we put O and L? 
            Constraints:
                O: not in 2? -> so O in 3? 
                L: not in 3? -> so L in 2? 
            Word: A (1), L (2), O (3), R (4), A (5) -> ""ALORA""? Is that a word? ""Alora"" is a proper name? But we need a common word? 

        Let me check: ""alora"" is not in the standard word list? 

        Duplicate of R? But R is at 4? Then we need another R? 
            We can put R in position 2,3, or 5? 
            But R cannot be in 2 or 3? (from feedback) and also not in 5? (from ""solar"" feedback: R in 5 was wrong) -> so R cannot be in 2,3,5? and 4 is already used? So duplicate of R would require a third R? Not possible.

        Duplicate of O? Then we have two O's and one L? 
            Positions 2,3,5: assign two O's and one L? 
            Constraints:
                O: not in 2? -> so O cannot be in 2? 
                L: not in 3? 
            So we can put:
                Option: L in 2, O in 3, O in 5? -> ""A L O R O"" -> ""ALORO""? not a word.
                Option: O in 3, L in 5, O in ? -> wait, we have only three positions? 
                We have to use two O's: so one O in 3 and one in 5? and L in 2? -> ""A L O R O"" -> ""ALORO"" not a word.
                Or O in 5 and O in 3? and L in 2? same as above.

        Duplicate of L? Then we have two L's and one O? 
            Positions 2,3,5: 
                L cannot be in 3? 
                O cannot be in 2? 
            So we can put:
                L in 2, O in 5, and L in ? -> but we have only three positions? 
                We need to place two L's and one O? 
                If L in 2, then the other L cannot be in 3? so must be in 5? but then O must be in 3? 
                Word: A (1), L (2), O (3), R (4), L (5) -> ""ALORL""? not a word.

   Subcase 2b: A in position 5.
        Word: ? _ _ R A
        Positions 1,2,3 to fill? 

        We have to use two of {O, L} and one duplicate? 

        The duplicate could be A, R, O, L.

        But A is at 5? so duplicate of A would require another A? But A cannot be in 2,3,4? and position 1 is available? 
            So we could put A in position 1? 
            Then word: A (1), ? (2), ? (3), R (4), A (5) -> but then we have two A's? 
            Then positions 2 and 3: O and L? 
            Constraints:
                O: not in 2? -> so O in 3? 
                L: not in 3? -> so L in 2? 
            Word: A (1), L (2), O (3), R (4), A (5) -> ""ALORA"" again? 

        Duplicate of R? R is at 4? then another R? 
            R cannot be in 1,2,3,5? (because not in 2,3,5 from feedback, and 4 is taken) -> so impossible.

        Duplicate of O? 
            Positions 1,2,3: two O's and one L? 
            O cannot be in 2? 
            L cannot be in 3? 
            So we can put:
                O in 1, L in 2, O in 3? -> but L in 2 is allowed? O in 3 is allowed? 
                Word: O (1), L (2), O (3), R (4), A (5) -> ""OLORA""? not a word.

                O in 1, O in 3, L in 2? -> same as above.

                Or O in 3, L in 1, O in ? -> but then we have to put the second O somewhere? 
                If L in 1, O in 3, then the second O must be in 2? but O cannot be in 2? -> invalid.

        Duplicate of L? 
            Positions 1,2,3: two L's and one O? 
            L cannot be in 3? 
            O cannot be in 2? 
            So we can put:
                L in 1, O in 3, L in 2? -> but O in 3 is allowed? L in 2 is allowed? 
                Word: L (1), L (2), O (3), R (4), A (5) -> ""LLORA""? not a word.

                L in 1, L in 2, O in 3? -> ""LLORA"" again.

                L in 1, O in 2? -> but O cannot be in 2? invalid.

                O in 1, L in 2, L in 3? -> but L cannot be in 3? invalid.

 So we are struggling to find a word? 

 Perhaps ""ALORA"" is accepted? Or maybe we missed a word? 

 Let me think of common words that have A, R, O, L and one duplicate? 

 How about ""ROYAL""? But Y is eliminated? 

 How about ""FOCAL""? But F and C? C is eliminated? 

 How about ""LOYAL""? 
   L, O, Y, A, L -> but Y is eliminated? 

 How about ""LORAL""? 
   L, O, R, A, L -> but that's L,O,R,A,L -> positions: 
   We have two L's? 
   Let me see if it fits: 
        We need to place: 
          A: must be in 1 or 5? In ""LORAL"", A is in position 4? But we know A cannot be in 4? So invalid.

 How about ""ORALS""? but S is eliminated? 

 How about ""MORAL""? 
   M, O, R, A, L -> distinct letters? 
   But we have M? 
   Let's see the positions:
        A is in position 4? But we know A cannot be in 4? 

 How about ""MOLAR""? 
   M, O, L, A, R -> distinct? 
   Positions:
        A is in position 4? again not allowed? 

 How about ""SOLAR"" we already guessed? 

 We need to consider that the feedback might allow ""ALORA"" or similar? 

 But let me think: is there a word like ""LARVA""? 
   L, A, R, V, A -> duplicate A? 
   Positions: 
        A in position 2 and 5? 
        But we know A cannot be in 2? 

 How about ""AROMA""? 
   A, R, O, M, A -> duplicate A? 
   Positions: 
        A in 1 and 5? 
        R in 2? -> but R cannot be in 2? 

 How about ""RADAR""? 
   R, A, D, A, R -> duplicate R and A? 
   Positions: 
        R in 1 and 5? -> R in 5 is not allowed? 
        A in 2 and 4? -> A in 2 and 4 are not allowed? 

 How about ""LABOR""? 
   L, A, B, O, R -> distinct? 
   Positions: 
        A in 2? -> not allowed? 

 How about ""BARON""? N eliminated? 

 How about ""CAROL""? C eliminated? 

 How about ""DROLL""? 
   D, R, O, L, L -> duplicate L? 
   Positions: 
        R in 2? -> not allowed? 

 How about ""FLOAT""? T eliminated? 

 How about ""GLOAT""? T eliminated? 

 How about ""BROAD""? 
   B, R, O, A, D -> distinct? 
   Positions: 
        R in 2? -> not allowed? 

 How about ""DOGMA""? 
   D, O, G, M, A -> distinct? 
   But we don't have R? 

 We must have R? 

 How about ""DRAMA""? 
   D, R, A, M, A -> duplicate A? 
   Positions: 
        R in 2? -> not allowed? 

 How about ""LAMPS""? S and P eliminated? 

 I am considering that the secret word might be ""oral"" something? 

 Another idea: the word ""LORDS""? but S eliminated? 

 Perhaps we missed a possibility: in the first guess, we had ""crane"", and R was in position 2 and it was wrong position, but that doesn't mean R is not in position 2 for other occurrences? But no, because the feedback is per letter, not per occurrence. In Wordle, if there is a duplicate, the feedback might be complex? 

 But in our feedback, for ""solar"", we have R in position 5 and it was marked wrong position, which means that either there is another R that is not in position 5, or if there is only one R, then it's not in 5. 

 Given the difficulty, let's try to guess a word that tests the possibility of A in position 1 and R in position 4, with common letters in the other positions? 

 We know the word has O and L as well? 

 So let's try ""ALERT""? but E and T are eliminated? 

 How about ""ADORE""? E eliminated? 

 How about ""ABHOR""? 
   A, B, H, O, R -> distinct? 
   Positions: 
        A in 1? -> allowed? 
        B in 2? 
        H in 3? 
        O in 4? -> but we have R in position 5? 
        R in 5? -> but R cannot be in 5? 

 In ""ABHOR"", R is in position 5? which is not allowed? 

 How about ""ABHOR"" with R in position 4? But the word is A,B,H,O,R -> R is at 5? 

 How about ""ARMOR""? 
   A, R, M, O, R -> duplicate R? 
   Positions: 
        A in 1? -> allowed? 
        R in 2? -> not allowed? 

 How about ""ARMOR"" with A in 1, R in 1? not possible. 

 How about ""RASER""? not a word. 

 I think we need to try a word that has A in position 5 and R in position 4, and then for position 1,2,3: we try to use O and L and one new letter? 

 For example, ""??R A"" with the first three positions filled with O, L, and a new letter? 

 But we have to avoid the eliminated letters. 

 Let me try: 
   Position 1: O? -> allowed? 
   Position 2: L? -> allowed? (L can be in 2) 
   Position 3: ? (new letter, say D) 
   Position 4: R 
   Position 5: A 
   Word: O L D R A -> ""OLDRA"" not a word.

   Position 1: L? 
   Position 2: O? -> not allowed (O cannot be in 2) 
   invalid.

   Position 1: D? 
   Position 2: O? -> not allowed 
   invalid.

   Position 1: O? 
   Position 2: D? 
   Position 3: L? -> not allowed (L cannot be in 3) 
   invalid.

   Position 1: L? 
   Position 2: D? 
   Position 3: O? -> allowed? 
   Position 4: R 
   Position 5: A 
   Word: L D O R A -> ""LDORA"" not a word.

   Position 1: D? 
   Position 2: L? -> allowed? 
   Position 3: O? -> allowed? 
   Word: D L O R A -> ""DLORA"" not a word.

 So not working. 

 Perhaps the word is ""LARVA""? but A in position 2 is not allowed. 

 Let me try to ignore the distinct letters assumption. 

 We know the word has at least A, R, O, L. And one of them is repeated. 

 We have feedback from ""solar"": 
   O in position 2: wrong position -> so there is an O not in position 2? 
   L in position 3: wrong position -> so there is an L not in position 3? 
   A in position 4: wrong position -> so there is an A not in position 4? 
   R in position 5: wrong position -> so there is an R not in position 5? 

 If there is a duplicate, then the feedback might be for one of the occurrences. 

 For example, if the word has two A's, then one A might be in a correct position and the other in wrong? But the feedback for ""solar"" has A in position 4 and it's marked wrong, so at least the A in position 4 is not correct. If there is another A, it might be in a correct position? 

 But in our earlier constraints, we have that A cannot be in 2,3,4? so the only possibility for a correct A is position 1 or 5. 

 Similarly for R: cannot be in 2,3,5? so only position 1 or 4. 

 Let's try to assume that the word has two A's. Then one A must be in 1 or 5, and the other A must be in the other of 1 or 5, or in a position that is not 2,3,4? but there are only positions 1 and 5 available for A? so both A's must be in 1 and 5? 

 Then the word starts and ends with A? 

 So the word is A _ _ _ A 

 And we know R is in the word, and must be in position 4? (because R can only be in 1 or 4, but position 1 is A, so R in 4) 

 Then the word is A _ _ R A 

 Now, we have to fill positions 2 and 3 with O and L? because we know O and L are in the word? 

 But we have only two positions? and two letters? 

 Constraints: 
   O: not in 2? 
   L: not in 3? 

 So we can put:
   Option 1: O in 3, L in 2? 
        Word: A L O R A -> ""ALORA"" 

   Option 2: L in 2, O in 3? -> same as above.

   Option 3: We might have duplicates of O or L? but we have only two positions? 

 So the only possibility is ""ALORA"". 

 Is ""ALORA"" a word? 

 Upon checking, ""Alora"" is a proper name, but in the context of Wordle, it might be accepted? Or maybe not. 

 Alternatively, in some word lists, it might be included. 

 Given the constraints, I think we should try ""ALORA"". 

 So I will guess ""ALORA"". 

 But note: we have not used any new letters? We are only using A, L, O, R. 

 And we are assuming two A's. 

 If it's not a word, then we may have to try something else. 

 But let's try. 

 Guess: ""ALORA""

 Format: <guess>alora</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from all guesses:

- **Eliminated Letters**: C, E, N, P, T, Y, S (not in the word).
- **Confirmed Letters**: A, R, O, L (all are in the word but misplaced in prior guesses).
- **Positional Constraints**:
  - A: Cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (must be in 1 or 5).
  - R: Cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (must be in 1 or 4).
  - O: Cannot be in position 2.
  - L: Cannot be in position 3.
- **Key Insight**: The word must contain at least one duplicate letter (since only 4 unique letters are confirmed for a 5-letter word). Given positional constraints, the only feasible solution is a duplicate ""A"" (since A must occupy positions 1 and 5 to satisfy all constraints), with R in position 4, and O and L in positions 2 and 3.

The word **""ALORA""** fits all criteria:
- A in position 1 (allowed) and 5 (allowed).
- R in position 4 (allowed).
- L in position 2 (allowed, as L can be in 2).
- O in position 3 (allowed, as O can be in 3).
- Satisfies feedback: A, L, O, R are in the word but not in positions tested in prior guesses.

<guess>alora</guess>",alora,"We are given feedback from the third guess ""solar"":
 S(x) : S is not in the secret word.
 O(-) : O is in the secret word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2).
 L(-) : L is in the secret word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
 A(-) : A is in the secret word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4).
 R(-) : R is in the secret word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5).

 Now, combining with previous feedback:

 Eliminated letters: C, N, E, P, T, Y, S (from this guess). So total eliminated: C, E, N, P, T, Y, S.

 Confirmed letters in the word: A, R (from before), and now also O and L are confirmed to be in the word.

 So the secret word contains: A, R, O, L. And one more letter? Because it's 5 letters? We have 4 confirmed: A, R, O, L. So there is one more letter to find.

 But note: the feedback for ""solar"" shows that all five letters in the guess are either not in the word (S) or in the word but wrong position (O, L, A, R). Since S is not in the word, we have O, L, A, R in the word? But we already knew A and R? Now we know O and L are also in the word? 

 However, wait: the word has 5 letters. We have 4 letters: A, R, O, L. So the fifth letter is missing? 

 But the feedback says that O, L, A, R are in the word? So the secret word must have at least these four? And one more? 

 But it could have duplicates? However, we have no indication of duplicates so far? 

 Alternatively, the secret word might have exactly these four and one duplicate? But we don't know.

 But let's assume for now that there are no duplicates? Then the secret word has 5 distinct letters: A, R, O, L, and one more.

 We also have positional constraints:

 From previous guesses:

 For A:
   - Not in position 2 (from ""party"" guess: A in position 2 was wrong)
   - Not in position 3 (from ""crane"" guess: A in position 3 was wrong)
   - Not in position 4 (from ""solar"" guess: A in position 4 was wrong)

 Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 5? (since positions 2,3,4 are ruled out)

 For R:
   - Not in position 2 (from ""crane"")
   - Not in position 3 (from ""party"")
   - Not in position 5 (from ""solar"": R in position 5 was wrong)

 Therefore, R must be in position 1 or 4? (positions 2,3,5 are ruled out)

 For O:
   - From ""solar"": O was in position 2 and it was wrong? So O is not in position 2.

 For L:
   - From ""solar"": L was in position 3 and it was wrong? So L is not in position 3.

 Now, we also know that the secret word has one more letter? Let's call it X? We don't know X.

 We need to form a 5-letter word with letters: A, R, O, L, X? Where X is a letter not eliminated? 

 Eliminated letters: C, E, N, P, T, Y, S.

 Available letters: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Z? But note: O is already in the word? So we are looking for one more letter? 

 But wait: the word must have 5 distinct letters? We don't know? But we haven't encountered duplicates? So let's assume distinct.

 Now, we have to assign positions:

 Positions: 1,2,3,4,5

 Constraints:
   A: position 1 or 5
   R: position 1 or 4
   O: not position 2
   L: not position 3

 Also, note: if R is in position 1, then A cannot be in position 1? So if R is in 1, then A must be in 5? 
   Similarly, if R is in 4, then A can be in 1 or 5? 

 But also, we have to place O and L and X.

 Let me consider the two cases for R:

 Case 1: R in position 1.
   Then A must be in position 5 (since A cannot be in 1 if R is there? And the only other option for A is 5).
   Then we have positions 2,3,4 to fill with O, L, and X.

   Constraints for O: not in 2? But we can put O in 3 or 4? 
   Constraints for L: not in 3? So L can be in 2 or 4? 

   But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters? 

   Also, we have to form a valid word.

   Example: R _ _ _ A

   We need to fill positions 2,3,4 with O, L, and X? 

   How about: R O L _ A? But then L is in position 3? But L cannot be in position 3? So that's invalid.

   How about: R O _ L A? Then O in position 2? But O cannot be in position 2? So that's invalid.

   How about: R L _ O A? 
        Position 2: L -> allowed? (L can be in 2? because we only know it cannot be in 3)
        Position 3: ? 
        Position 4: O -> allowed? (O can be in 4? because we only know it cannot be in 2)

   So we have R, L, ?, O, A.

   The word must be valid? What words are there? 

   Example: ""RULOA""? Not a word.

   How about ""RADIO""? But we have A and D? But D is not in the word? And we have O? But we have R in 1, A in 5? But in ""RADIO"", A is in 2? Not 5? 

   We need a word that ends with A? 

   Example: ""ROTLA""? Not a word.

   How about ""ROULA""? Not a word.

   How about ""RHYLA""? Not a word.

   This seems difficult? 

 Case 2: R in position 4.
   Then A can be in position 1 or 5.

   Subcase 2a: A in position 1.
        Word: A _ _ R ?

        The last position must be the fifth letter? But we have O, L, and X to place? 

        Positions: 
          1: A
          2: ? 
          3: ?
          4: R
          5: ?

        We have to place O, L, and X in positions 2,3,5? 

        Constraints: 
          O: not in 2? So O can be in 3 or 5?
          L: not in 3? So L can be in 2 or 5?

        Example: A L O R ? -> but then we have to put X in position 5? But we have only one spot? And we have two letters? Wait, no: we have three letters to place? But we have three positions? 

        Actually, we have to assign O, L, and X to positions 2,3,5? 

        How about: 
          Position 2: L? -> allowed? 
          Position 3: O? -> allowed? (O can be in 3? because we only know it cannot be in 2)
          Position 5: X? 

        But then we have a word: A L O R X? 

        But we need a valid word? 

        Example: ""ALOR X"" -> not a word? 

        How about: 
          Position 2: X (the unknown)
          Position 3: L? -> but L cannot be in 3? So invalid.

        How about:
          Position 2: X
          Position 3: O? -> allowed? 
          Position 5: L? -> allowed? 

        Then word: A X O R L? 

        Example: ""AXORL"" not a word.

        How about:
          Position 2: O? -> but O cannot be in 2? So invalid.

        How about:
          Position 2: L? -> allowed? 
          Position 3: X? 
          Position 5: O? -> allowed? 

        Word: A L X R O? 

        Example: ""ALXRO"" not a word.

        How about:
          Position 2: X
          Position 3: ? -> we have to put either O or L? But O can be in 3? and L cannot be in 3? So we put O in 3? 
          Position 5: L? 

        Word: A X O R L? -> not a word.

   Subcase 2b: A in position 5.
        Word: ? _ _ R A

        We have to fill positions 1,2,3 with O, L, and X? 

        Constraints:
          O: not in 2? So O can be in 1 or 3?
          L: not in 3? So L can be in 1 or 2?

        Example: 
          Position 1: O? -> allowed? 
          Position 2: L? -> allowed? (L can be in 2? because we only know it cannot be in 3)
          Position 3: X? 
          Then word: O L X R A? 

        Example: ""OLXRA"" not a word.

        How about:
          Position 1: L? 
          Position 2: O? -> but O cannot be in 2? So invalid.

        How about:
          Position 1: O? 
          Position 2: X? 
          Position 3: L? -> but L cannot be in 3? So invalid.

        How about:
          Position 1: X? 
          Position 2: O? -> invalid (O cannot be in 2)
          Position 3: L? -> invalid (L cannot be in 3)

        How about:
          Position 1: L? 
          Position 2: X? 
          Position 3: O? -> allowed? (O can be in 3? because we only know it cannot be in 2)

        Then word: L X O R A? 

        Example: ""LXORA"" not a word.

        How about:
          Position 1: O? 
          Position 2: L? -> allowed? 
          Position 3: X? 
          Then word: O L X R A? 

        Example: ""OLXRA"" not a word.

 This is getting difficult? Maybe we need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? 

 Alternatively, we might have missed that the secret word has only 4 distinct letters? For example, one letter repeated? 

 Let me reexamine the feedback.

 In the third guess ""solar"", we had:
   S (x) -> not in word
   O (-) -> in word, wrong position
   L (-) -> in word, wrong position
   A (-) -> in word, wrong position
   R (-) -> in word, wrong position

 This means that the secret word contains O, L, A, R? But it might have a duplicate of one of these? Or it might have a fifth letter that is one of these? 

 But note: we have five positions? And we have four letters? So there must be a duplicate? 

 Therefore, the secret word has at least one duplicate letter? 

 Which letter is duplicated? It could be A, R, O, or L? 

 Now, let's think about the first guess ""crane"": 
   C (x), R (-), A (-), N (x), E (x)

 And second guess ""party"":
   P (x), A (-), R (-), T (x), Y (x)

 In ""crane"", we had R and A? And in ""party"", we had A and R? And in ""solar"", we had O, L, A, R? 

 If there is a duplicate, then one of these letters appears twice? 

 How can we find out which one? 

 We can try to consider the positions again? 

 But we have constraints on positions? 

 Let me list the positions we know are invalid for each letter:

 A: cannot be in 2,3,4 (from positions in ""party"", ""crane"", ""solar"")
    So A must be in 1 or 5.

 R: cannot be in 2,3,5 (from ""crane"", ""party"", ""solar"")
    So R must be in 1 or 4.

 O: cannot be in 2 (from ""solar"")
    So O can be in 1,3,4,5.

 L: cannot be in 3 (from ""solar"")
    So L can be in 1,2,4,5.

 Now, if there is a duplicate, then one of these letters appears twice? 

 We have to form a word that has five letters from {A, R, O, L} with one duplicate? 

 The word must have exactly five letters? So one letter appears twice? 

 Let me try to assign positions:

 We have two cases for R: position 1 or 4.

 Case 1: R in position 1.
   Then A must be in position 5? (because A cannot be in 1 if R is there? and A can only be in 1 or 5? so 5)
   Then we have positions 2,3,4 to fill? 

   We have to use two of {O, L} and one duplicate of either A, R, O, or L? 

   But R is already used? And A is at the end? 

   So the duplicate could be R? But R is at position 1? Then we need another R? 
   Or duplicate of A? But A is at position 5? Then we need another A? 
   Or duplicate of O or L? 

   Let me try duplicate of O? Then we have two O's and one L? 

   Positions 2,3,4: we need to assign two O's and one L? 

   But constraints:
        O: not in 2? So O cannot be in position 2? 
        L: not in 3? 

   So if we put L in position 2? Then we can put O in 3 and 4? 
        Word: R (1), L (2), O (3), O (4), A (5) -> ""RLOOA""? Not a word.

   If we put L in position 4? Then we put O in 2? But O cannot be in 2? So invalid.

   If we put L in position 3? But L cannot be in 3? 

   So duplicate of O doesn't work.

   Duplicate of L? Then we have two L's and one O? 
        Positions 2,3,4: two L's and one O? 
        But L cannot be in 3? So we cannot put L in position 3? 
        So we must put L in positions 2 and 4? 
        Then O in position 3? 
        Word: R (1), L (2), O (3), L (4), A (5) -> ""RLOLA""? Not a word.

   Duplicate of A? Then we have two A's? But A is already in position 5? So we need another A in positions 2,3, or 4? 
        But A cannot be in 2,3,4? Because we have feedback that A is not in 2,3,4? 
        So impossible.

   Duplicate of R? Then we have two R's? One at position 1, and another in positions 2,3,4? 
        But R cannot be in 2 or 3? So it must be in position 4? 
        Then we have R at 1 and 4? 
        Then positions 2 and 3: we have to put O and L? 
        Constraints: 
            O: not in 2? So O must be in 3? 
            L: not in 3? So L must be in 2? 
        Word: R (1), L (2), O (3), R (4), A (5) -> ""RLORA""? Not a word.

 Case 2: R in position 4.
   Then A can be in 1 or 5.

   Subcase 2a: A in position 1.
        Word: A _ _ R ?
        Positions 2,3,5 to fill? (since position 4 is R)

        We have to use two of {O, L} and one duplicate? 

        The duplicate could be A, R, O, L.

        But A is at 1? So if duplicate of A, then we need another A? But A cannot be in 2,3,4? and 5 is available? But we have position 5 available? 
            So we could put A in position 5? But then we have two A's? 
            Then positions 2 and 3: we put O and L? 
            Constraints:
                O: not in 2? -> so O in 3? 
                L: not in 3? -> so L in 2? 
            Word: A (1), L (2), O (3), R (4), A (5) -> ""ALORA""? Is that a word? ""Alora"" is a proper name? But we need a common word? 

        Let me check: ""alora"" is not in the standard word list? 

        Duplicate of R? But R is at 4? Then we need another R? 
            We can put R in position 2,3, or 5? 
            But R cannot be in 2 or 3? (from feedback) and also not in 5? (from ""solar"" feedback: R in 5 was wrong) -> so R cannot be in 2,3,5? and 4 is already used? So duplicate of R would require a third R? Not possible.

        Duplicate of O? Then we have two O's and one L? 
            Positions 2,3,5: assign two O's and one L? 
            Constraints:
                O: not in 2? -> so O cannot be in 2? 
                L: not in 3? 
            So we can put:
                Option: L in 2, O in 3, O in 5? -> ""A L O R O"" -> ""ALORO""? not a word.
                Option: O in 3, L in 5, O in ? -> wait, we have only three positions? 
                We have to use two O's: so one O in 3 and one in 5? and L in 2? -> ""A L O R O"" -> ""ALORO"" not a word.
                Or O in 5 and O in 3? and L in 2? same as above.

        Duplicate of L? Then we have two L's and one O? 
            Positions 2,3,5: 
                L cannot be in 3? 
                O cannot be in 2? 
            So we can put:
                L in 2, O in 5, and L in ? -> but we have only three positions? 
                We need to place two L's and one O? 
                If L in 2, then the other L cannot be in 3? so must be in 5? but then O must be in 3? 
                Word: A (1), L (2), O (3), R (4), L (5) -> ""ALORL""? not a word.

   Subcase 2b: A in position 5.
        Word: ? _ _ R A
        Positions 1,2,3 to fill? 

        We have to use two of {O, L} and one duplicate? 

        The duplicate could be A, R, O, L.

        But A is at 5? so duplicate of A would require another A? But A cannot be in 2,3,4? and position 1 is available? 
            So we could put A in position 1? 
            Then word: A (1), ? (2), ? (3), R (4), A (5) -> but then we have two A's? 
            Then positions 2 and 3: O and L? 
            Constraints:
                O: not in 2? -> so O in 3? 
                L: not in 3? -> so L in 2? 
            Word: A (1), L (2), O (3), R (4), A (5) -> ""ALORA"" again? 

        Duplicate of R? R is at 4? then another R? 
            R cannot be in 1,2,3,5? (because not in 2,3,5 from feedback, and 4 is taken) -> so impossible.

        Duplicate of O? 
            Positions 1,2,3: two O's and one L? 
            O cannot be in 2? 
            L cannot be in 3? 
            So we can put:
                O in 1, L in 2, O in 3? -> but L in 2 is allowed? O in 3 is allowed? 
                Word: O (1), L (2), O (3), R (4), A (5) -> ""OLORA""? not a word.

                O in 1, O in 3, L in 2? -> same as above.

                Or O in 3, L in 1, O in ? -> but then we have to put the second O somewhere? 
                If L in 1, O in 3, then the second O must be in 2? but O cannot be in 2? -> invalid.

        Duplicate of L? 
            Positions 1,2,3: two L's and one O? 
            L cannot be in 3? 
            O cannot be in 2? 
            So we can put:
                L in 1, O in 3, L in 2? -> but O in 3 is allowed? L in 2 is allowed? 
                Word: L (1), L (2), O (3), R (4), A (5) -> ""LLORA""? not a word.

                L in 1, L in 2, O in 3? -> ""LLORA"" again.

                L in 1, O in 2? -> but O cannot be in 2? invalid.

                O in 1, L in 2, L in 3? -> but L cannot be in 3? invalid.

 So we are struggling to find a word? 

 Perhaps ""ALORA"" is accepted? Or maybe we missed a word? 

 Let me think of common words that have A, R, O, L and one duplicate? 

 How about ""ROYAL""? But Y is eliminated? 

 How about ""FOCAL""? But F and C? C is eliminated? 

 How about ""LOYAL""? 
   L, O, Y, A, L -> but Y is eliminated? 

 How about ""LORAL""? 
   L, O, R, A, L -> but that's L,O,R,A,L -> positions: 
   We have two L's? 
   Let me see if it fits: 
        We need to place: 
          A: must be in 1 or 5? In ""LORAL"", A is in position 4? But we know A cannot be in 4? So invalid.

 How about ""ORALS""? but S is eliminated? 

 How about ""MORAL""? 
   M, O, R, A, L -> distinct letters? 
   But we have M? 
   Let's see the positions:
        A is in position 4? But we know A cannot be in 4? 

 How about ""MOLAR""? 
   M, O, L, A, R -> distinct? 
   Positions:
        A is in position 4? again not allowed? 

 How about ""SOLAR"" we already guessed? 

 We need to consider that the feedback might allow ""ALORA"" or similar? 

 But let me think: is there a word like ""LARVA""? 
   L, A, R, V, A -> duplicate A? 
   Positions: 
        A in position 2 and 5? 
        But we know A cannot be in 2? 

 How about ""AROMA""? 
   A, R, O, M, A -> duplicate A? 
   Positions: 
        A in 1 and 5? 
        R in 2? -> but R cannot be in 2? 

 How about ""RADAR""? 
   R, A, D, A, R -> duplicate R and A? 
   Positions: 
        R in 1 and 5? -> R in 5 is not allowed? 
        A in 2 and 4? -> A in 2 and 4 are not allowed? 

 How about ""LABOR""? 
   L, A, B, O, R -> distinct? 
   Positions: 
        A in 2? -> not allowed? 

 How about ""BARON""? N eliminated? 

 How about ""CAROL""? C eliminated? 

 How about ""DROLL""? 
   D, R, O, L, L -> duplicate L? 
   Positions: 
        R in 2? -> not allowed? 

 How about ""FLOAT""? T eliminated? 

 How about ""GLOAT""? T eliminated? 

 How about ""BROAD""? 
   B, R, O, A, D -> distinct? 
   Positions: 
        R in 2? -> not allowed? 

 How about ""DOGMA""? 
   D, O, G, M, A -> distinct? 
   But we don't have R? 

 We must have R? 

 How about ""DRAMA""? 
   D, R, A, M, A -> duplicate A? 
   Positions: 
        R in 2? -> not allowed? 

 How about ""LAMPS""? S and P eliminated? 

 I am considering that the secret word might be ""oral"" something? 

 Another idea: the word ""LORDS""? but S eliminated? 

 Perhaps we missed a possibility: in the first guess, we had ""crane"", and R was in position 2 and it was wrong position, but that doesn't mean R is not in position 2 for other occurrences? But no, because the feedback is per letter, not per occurrence. In Wordle, if there is a duplicate, the feedback might be complex? 

 But in our feedback, for ""solar"", we have R in position 5 and it was marked wrong position, which means that either there is another R that is not in position 5, or if there is only one R, then it's not in 5. 

 Given the difficulty, let's try to guess a word that tests the possibility of A in position 1 and R in position 4, with common letters in the other positions? 

 We know the word has O and L as well? 

 So let's try ""ALERT""? but E and T are eliminated? 

 How about ""ADORE""? E eliminated? 

 How about ""ABHOR""? 
   A, B, H, O, R -> distinct? 
   Positions: 
        A in 1? -> allowed? 
        B in 2? 
        H in 3? 
        O in 4? -> but we have R in position 5? 
        R in 5? -> but R cannot be in 5? 

 In ""ABHOR"", R is in position 5? which is not allowed? 

 How about ""ABHOR"" with R in position 4? But the word is A,B,H,O,R -> R is at 5? 

 How about ""ARMOR""? 
   A, R, M, O, R -> duplicate R? 
   Positions: 
        A in 1? -> allowed? 
        R in 2? -> not allowed? 

 How about ""ARMOR"" with A in 1, R in 1? not possible. 

 How about ""RASER""? not a word. 

 I think we need to try a word that has A in position 5 and R in position 4, and then for position 1,2,3: we try to use O and L and one new letter? 

 For example, ""??R A"" with the first three positions filled with O, L, and a new letter? 

 But we have to avoid the eliminated letters. 

 Let me try: 
   Position 1: O? -> allowed? 
   Position 2: L? -> allowed? (L can be in 2) 
   Position 3: ? (new letter, say D) 
   Position 4: R 
   Position 5: A 
   Word: O L D R A -> ""OLDRA"" not a word.

   Position 1: L? 
   Position 2: O? -> not allowed (O cannot be in 2) 
   invalid.

   Position 1: D? 
   Position 2: O? -> not allowed 
   invalid.

   Position 1: O? 
   Position 2: D? 
   Position 3: L? -> not allowed (L cannot be in 3) 
   invalid.

   Position 1: L? 
   Position 2: D? 
   Position 3: O? -> allowed? 
   Position 4: R 
   Position 5: A 
   Word: L D O R A -> ""LDORA"" not a word.

   Position 1: D? 
   Position 2: L? -> allowed? 
   Position 3: O? -> allowed? 
   Word: D L O R A -> ""DLORA"" not a word.

 So not working. 

 Perhaps the word is ""LARVA""? but A in position 2 is not allowed. 

 Let me try to ignore the distinct letters assumption. 

 We know the word has at least A, R, O, L. And one of them is repeated. 

 We have feedback from ""solar"": 
   O in position 2: wrong position -> so there is an O not in position 2? 
   L in position 3: wrong position -> so there is an L not in position 3? 
   A in position 4: wrong position -> so there is an A not in position 4? 
   R in position 5: wrong position -> so there is an R not in position 5? 

 If there is a duplicate, then the feedback might be for one of the occurrences. 

 For example, if the word has two A's, then one A might be in a correct position and the other in wrong? But the feedback for ""solar"" has A in position 4 and it's marked wrong, so at least the A in position 4 is not correct. If there is another A, it might be in a correct position? 

 But in our earlier constraints, we have that A cannot be in 2,3,4? so the only possibility for a correct A is position 1 or 5. 

 Similarly for R: cannot be in 2,3,5? so only position 1 or 4. 

 Let's try to assume that the word has two A's. Then one A must be in 1 or 5, and the other A must be in the other of 1 or 5, or in a position that is not 2,3,4? but there are only positions 1 and 5 available for A? so both A's must be in 1 and 5? 

 Then the word starts and ends with A? 

 So the word is A _ _ _ A 

 And we know R is in the word, and must be in position 4? (because R can only be in 1 or 4, but position 1 is A, so R in 4) 

 Then the word is A _ _ R A 

 Now, we have to fill positions 2 and 3 with O and L? because we know O and L are in the word? 

 But we have only two positions? and two letters? 

 Constraints: 
   O: not in 2? 
   L: not in 3? 

 So we can put:
   Option 1: O in 3, L in 2? 
        Word: A L O R A -> ""ALORA"" 

   Option 2: L in 2, O in 3? -> same as above.

   Option 3: We might have duplicates of O or L? but we have only two positions? 

 So the only possibility is ""ALORA"". 

 Is ""ALORA"" a word? 

 Upon checking, ""Alora"" is a proper name, but in the context of Wordle, it might be accepted? Or maybe not. 

 Alternatively, in some word lists, it might be included. 

 Given the constraints, I think we should try ""ALORA"". 

 So I will guess ""ALORA"". 

 But note: we have not used any new letters? We are only using A, L, O, R. 

 And we are assuming two A's. 

 If it's not a word, then we may have to try something else. 

 But let's try. 

 Guess: ""ALORA""

 Format: <guess>alora</guess>After analyzing the feedback from all guesses:

- **Eliminated Letters**: C, E, N, P, T, Y, S (not in the word).
- **Confirmed Letters**: A, R, O, L (all are in the word but misplaced in prior guesses).
- **Positional Constraints**:
  - A: Cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (must be in 1 or 5).
  - R: Cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (must be in 1 or 4).
  - O: Cannot be in position 2.
  - L: Cannot be in position 3.
- **Key Insight**: The word must contain at least one duplicate letter (since only 4 unique letters are confirmed for a 5-letter word). Given positional constraints, the only feasible solution is a duplicate ""A"" (since A must occupy positions 1 and 5 to satisfy all constraints), with R in position 4, and O and L in positions 2 and 3.

The word **""ALORA""** fits all criteria:
- A in position 1 (allowed) and 5 (allowed).
- R in position 4 (allowed).
- L in position 2 (allowed, as L can be in 2).
- O in position 3 (allowed, as O can be in 3).
- Satisfies feedback: A, L, O, R are in the word but not in positions tested in prior guesses.",Guess 4: alora -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(✓) O(✓) R(✓) A(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,FLORA,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) : C is not in the secret word.
 R(-) : R is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
 A(-) : A is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
 N(x) : N is not in the secret word.
 E(x) : E is not in the secret word.

 So, we know the secret word contains R and A, but not C, N, or E.
 Also, R and A are not in the positions they were in the guess ""crane"". In ""crane"", R was the second letter and A was the third.

 Since R was in the second position in the guess and it's marked wrong position, that means R is either in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 in the secret word? Let me note the positions:
 Position 1: C -> x
 Position 2: R -> - (so R is in the word but not in position 2)
 Position 3: A -> - (so A is in the word but not in position 3)
 Position 4: N -> x
 Position 5: E -> x

 We know the word has 5 letters and must contain R and A, but exclude C, N, E.

 Also, since R and A are present but in wrong positions, let us try to think of words that have R and A, without C, N, E.

 Now, we have to make a second guess. We want a word that:
   - Does not contain R in position 2 or A in position 3.
   - Does not contain C, N, E at all.

 Additionally, we might want to reuse other letters to test for more common consonants? But note: we don't know what other letters might be in the word.

 Since we know A is in the word, let's try to place A in a different position. Similarly for R.

 Possibilities for R: We can try putting R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, any except 2.
 Similarly, A: any except 3.

 We also don't know other letters. So, we can try a word that includes other common letters not yet tested? Such as T, S, L, etc.

 Important: We must avoid C, N, E.

 Let's think of words that have R, A, and maybe some new letters.

 Since we have only eliminated three letters (C, N, E) and the word has five letters, we have many possibilities.

 We can try a word with R in the first position? But note: if we put R in the first position, then we might get more information quickly.

 Some common words: 

 Example: ""RATIO""? But we don't know if O, I, T are in the word. Also, note that we haven't tested I, O, T. But wait, A is in ""RATIO"" and it's in position 2? We cannot have A in position 3? Actually, in ""RATIO"", A is in position 2. We don't know about position 2 for A yet? Only that in the previous guess A was in position 3 and that was wrong. So A might be in position 2? 

 However, the feedback only said that when A was in position 3 it was wrong. So A could be in position 2? Similarly, R was in position 2 and that was wrong, but R could be in any other position.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that puts A in position 1 and R in position 4 or 5? 

 Let me compile a list of common letters that we haven't eliminated: the alphabet without C, N, E: 
 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ without C, N, E -> leaves: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

 We know A and R are in the word. So we need to guess with A and R, plus three other letters that we haven't tried.

 We haven't tried many. We can try:

 Let me think of words that have A and R and avoid C,N,E.

 Possible words: 
   - ""PARTY"": has P,A,R,T,Y -> avoids C,N,E.
   - ""FARTS"": avoids C,N,E? But we might not want to guess that... 
   - ""STARK"": S,T,A,R,K -> avoids C,N,E.

 Alternatively, we can try to use different positions.

 We have:
   - Position 2: we now know it's not R? But we don't know what is in position two? Actually, we know that the secret word has A and R, and the first guess had C in position 1 which was wrong.

 Another idea: We also know that in the first guess, the letter in position 1 was incorrect (so not C), position 2 was R but wrong (so the secret word does not have R at position 2), position 3 was A but wrong (so secret word does not have A at position 3), position 4 was N (wrong and not in the word) and position 5 was E (wrong and not in the word).

 Let me think of a word that has:
   - R in position 1,4, or 5? 
   - A in position 1,2,4, or 5? 

 And we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Option: ""ROAST"": This word has R, O, A, S, T. It avoids C,N,E. But note:
   Position 1: R -> we are testing R in position 1? Also, in the secret word, R might be in position 1? 
   Position 2: O -> new letter
   Position 3: A -> but we know from previous feedback that A cannot be in position 3! So that would be a bad choice because we know the secret word does not have A in position 3. 

 Therefore, we cannot try a word that has A in position 3? Or R in position 2? We must avoid the positions we know they are not.

 So ""ROAST"" is invalid for this because A is forced into position 3? But we know it's not in position 3. So we skip that.

 Alternatively, ""RATIO"": Has R at position 1, A at position 2, T, I, O. 
   Position 3: T -> unknown
   Position 4: I -> unknown
   Position 5: O -> unknown

 But we don't know if the secret word has T,I,O. And we avoid C,N,E.

 Alternatively, ""STAIR"": S,T,A,I,R. 
   Positions: 
     1: S
     2: T
     3: A -> we know A cannot be in position 3? So that's bad.

 How about ""TRIAL"": T,R,I,A,L? 
   Position 1: T
   Position 2: R -> but we know that R should not be in position 2? Because in the first guess R was in position 2 and it was wrong. So we must avoid R in position 2? Therefore, ""TRIAL"" is invalid.

 So we avoid both R in position 2 and A in position 3.

 Another idea: ""PARTY"": 
   P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)
   Now: 
      A is in position 2 -> not position 3? That's okay because the rule about A was only that it was wrong in position 3, but we don't know about other positions? 
      Similarly, R is in position 3 -> which is different from position 2? So that's okay.

 However, note: We don't know if position 3 is okay for R? The feedback only said that when R was in position 2 it was wrong. So R could be in position 3? Similarly, A is in position 2? It wasn't tested in position 2 before? Actually, we have no information about position 2 for A? Because the first guess had A only in position 3.

 Therefore, ""PARTY"" is a valid guess.

 Why is it valid?
   - It has A and R? (Yes)
   - A is in position 2? Which wasn't tested? So that might be correct? Or might be wrong? We don't know.
   - R is in position 3? Which we don't know? 

 We are testing R in a new position? And A in a new position? Also, introducing P, T, Y? 

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that places A and R in positions we haven't tested? But actually, we haven't tested any other positions? Only we know position 2 and position 3 in the first guess? 

 However, we have two letters that must be in the word: R and A. 

 I think ""PARTY"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters.

 Another candidate: ""STRAY"": 
   S (1), T (2), R (3), A (4), Y (5) 
   This avoids R in position 2 and A in position 3? Yes? 
   Also, the letters S,T,R,A,Y? All new? 

 How about ""TRAPS"": 
   T (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? Because first feedback said R is not in position 2? So that would be invalid.

 How about ""RADAR"": 
   R (1), A (2), D (3), A (4), R (5). 
   But note: the word has duplicate R and A? We don't know if the secret word has duplicates? We haven't been told? The rules don't say that the word has distinct letters? But Wordle typically allows repeated letters? So that's possible? 

 But note the feedback: In the first guess, each letter was evaluated independently? And we only know that the secret word must have at least one R and at least one A? It could have more? 

 However, to keep it simple, maybe we avoid duplicates for now? 

 Alternatively, let me think: We want to maximize information? 

 Considering the above, let me propose ""STRAY"".

 But note: we might have a problem? In ""STRAY"", the R is in position 3 and A is in position 4. 

 Other options: ""RAYON""? But ""RAYON"" has Y and O? But we haven't tested? But note: ""RAYON"" avoids C,N,E? But wait, N is eliminated? Oh, ""RAYON"" has N? Which we know is not in the word? Because first feedback said N is not in the word? -> So ""RAYON"" is invalid? Because it contains N? So we must avoid N?

 Therefore, we cannot choose ""RAYON"".

 Let me stick with ""STRAY"". 

 Now, ""STRAY"":
   S -> new, not tested? So it's safe? 
   T -> new?
   R -> we know is in the word? So we are testing R at position 3?
   A -> at position 4? 
   Y -> new.

 We don't have any constraints against position 3 for R? Or position 4 for A? Since the only constraints are R not at 2 and A not at 3? 

 So ""STRAY"" seems okay.

 Alternatively, ""PARTY"" also seems okay, but using P? 

 Since we don't know, I'm going to choose ""PARTY"" because it introduces P, T, Y? Which might be helpful? 

 But let me think: T is a common letter? 

 I'll go with ""PARTY"".

 So the guess is ""PARTY"".

 Format: <guess>party</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- R and A **are** in the secret word, but they were in incorrect positions (R was position 2, A was position 3).

For my next guess:
- Must include R and A (since they are confirmed in the word).
- Avoid C, N, E entirely.
- Position R anywhere except position 2 (since feedback showed R is not in position 2).
- Position A anywhere except position 3 (since feedback showed A is not in position 3).
- Test new common consonants like T, P, and Y to gather more information.

I chose **""party""**:
- P (position 1): Untested letter to probe potential positions.
- A (position 2): Tests A in a new position given it can't be position 3.
- R (position 3): Tests R in a new position given it can't be position 2.
- T (position 4): Untested letter.
- Y (position 5): Untested letter.

This maximizes information by testing A/R in new positions while introducing 3 new letters (P, T, Y).

<guess>party</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) R(-) T(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the second guess ""party"":
 P(x) : P is not in the secret word.
 A(-) : A is in the secret word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2).
 R(-) : R is in the secret word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
 T(x) : T is not in the secret word.
 Y(x) : Y is not in the secret word.

 Now, combining with the first guess ""crane"" feedback:
   - C, N, E, P, T, Y are not in the word. (Eliminated letters: C, N, E, P, T, Y)
   - The word contains A and R, but not in the positions we've tried so far.

 Specifically, from ""crane"":
     Position 2: R was wrong -> so R is not in position 2.
     Position 3: A was wrong -> so A is not in position 3.

 From ""party"":
     Position 2: A was wrong -> so A is not in position 2.
     Position 3: R was wrong -> so R is not in position 3.

 Therefore, we know:
   - A cannot be in position 2 or 3.
   - R cannot be in position 2 or 3.

 Since the word is 5 letters, the possible positions for A are 1, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, the possible positions for R are 1, 4, or 5.

 But note: we have two letters that must be placed in positions 1,4,5? And we have three positions? So they could be in two of these three positions? Or one of them might be in one and the other in another? 

 Also, we have eliminated 6 letters: C, N, E, P, T, Y.

 We still need to find the remaining three letters? Because the word has 5 letters and we know two of them (A and R), so three more.

 We haven't tested many letters. We can try to use other common letters.

 The remaining letters that are possible: 
   Alphabet without eliminated: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,Q,R,S,U,V,W,X,Z

 But note: we know A and R are in the word, so we are looking for three more from the above set.

 We also have constraints on the positions of A and R.

 Let me think of words that have A and R, and three other letters from the remaining, and place A and R in positions 1,4,5? But not in 2 or 3.

 Also, we must avoid the positions we know they are not? 

 Possibilities for A: positions 1,4,5
 Possibilities for R: positions 1,4,5

 But note: they cannot be in the same position? So if we put A in position 1, then R can be in 4 or 5? Similarly, if A in 4, R in 1 or 5? Etc.

 We need to test as many new letters as possible? 

 Let me try to form a word:

 Option 1: Put A in position 1? Then we can have a word like ""A _ _ _ R"" or ""A _ _ R _"", but note the positions for R: 4 or 5? 

 But we also have to fill the other positions? 

 Option 2: Put R in position 1? Then A in 4 or 5? 

 Since we don't know, we can try to test both? But we have to choose one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and R in positions 4 and 5? 

 Example: 
   If we put A in 4 and R in 5: then the word ends with ""AR"". 
   Or A in 5 and R in 4: then the word ends with ""RA"".

 We can also try to test common letters in the middle.

 Let me think of words that have A and R in the last two positions? 

 For example: 
   ""SOLAR"": S,O,L,A,R -> but note: A is in position 4, R in position 5? 
   But we haven't tested S, O, L? 

 However, we have to avoid the eliminated letters? S, O, L are not eliminated? 

 But wait: we have eliminated C,N,E,P,T,Y? So S, O, L are okay.

 But let's check the positions: 
   In ""SOLAR"": 
      Position 1: S
      Position 2: O
      Position 3: L
      Position 4: A -> which is allowed? Because A can be in 4? 
      Position 5: R -> allowed? 

 However, we also have to consider that we don't know if the secret word has S, O, L? 

 But we are testing them? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and R in the first and last? 

 Example: ""R _ _ A _"" -> R in 1 and A in 4? Then the word is R ? ? A ? 

 How about ""ROBOT""? But we have O and B? But note: we have eliminated T? So ""ROBOT"" has T? Which is eliminated? So not allowed.

 How about ""RADII""? But we have D and I? But also, we have A in position 2? But we know A cannot be in position 2? Because from the second guess, A was in position 2 and it was wrong? So we cannot put A in position 2? 

 Therefore, if we put R in position 1, then A must be in position 4 or 5? 

 Similarly, if we put A in position 1, then R must be in 4 or 5? 

 So let me try to form a word with R in position 1 and A in position 4? 

 Example: ""R _ _ A ?"" 

 We need to fill positions 2,3,5? 

 We can use common letters: S, L, O, etc.

 How about ""RULER""? But we have U, L, E? But E is eliminated? So not allowed.

 How about ""RIFLE""? But E is eliminated? 

 How about ""RUMBA""? 
   R (1), U (2), M (3), B (4), A (5) -> but then A is in position 5? And we are not using position 4? Actually, we have A in position 5? 
   But we also have B in position 4? 

 However, we are testing U, M, B? 

 But note: we have A in position 5? Which is allowed? 

 Alternatively, we can try ""RUMBA"" but then we are putting A in position 5? 

 But we also have to avoid the eliminated letters? U, M, B are not eliminated? 

 However, we have two letters to test? 

 But let me think: we have two confirmed letters: A and R? And we are introducing U, M, B? 

 But we have to consider: we know that the secret word has A and R? And we are placing R at 1 and A at 5? 

 But we don't know if that's correct? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and R in the last two positions? Like ""SOLAR"" as I thought earlier? 

 Let me check: ""SOLAR"" -> S,O,L,A,R? 
   S: not tested? 
   O: not tested?
   L: not tested?
   A: in position 4? 
   R: in position 5? 

 This seems good? 

 But we have to avoid the eliminated letters? Yes, S,O,L are not eliminated? 

 So I think ""SOLAR"" is a good candidate? 

 However, note: we have already tried R in position 3 in ""party"" and it was wrong? But in ""SOLAR"", R is in position 5? Which is new? 

 Similarly, A was in position 4? Which we haven't tried? 

 Also, we are testing three new letters: S, O, L? 

 But what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know? But we haven't seen any duplicates so far? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more common letters? 

 Another idea: ""SAVOR"": 
   S (1), A (2) -> but A in position 2? We know A cannot be in position 2? Because from ""party"", A was in position 2 and it was wrong? So that's invalid.

 How about ""AROMA""? 
   A (1), R (2) -> but R in position 2? We know R cannot be in position 2? Because from ""crane"", R was in position 2 and wrong? So invalid.

 How about ""AUDIO""? 
   A (1), U (2), D (3), I (4), O (5) -> but we don't have R? We must include R? Because we know R is in the word? So we cannot skip R? 

 Therefore, we must include both A and R? 

 So ""SOLAR"" seems a good choice? 

 But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters? 

 How about ""SHARD""? 
   S (1), H (2), A (3) -> but A in position 3? We know A cannot be in position 3? So invalid.

 How about ""FRAUD""? 
   F (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""BRAWL""? 
   B (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""CRAWL""? But C is eliminated? 

 How about ""DRAWL""? 
   D (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""GRASP""? 
   G (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""RASPY""? 
   R (1), A (2) -> but A in position 2? Not allowed? 

 So it's tricky? 

 Let me try to put A in position 1? 

 Example: ""A _ _ R _"" 

 How about ""ALARM""? 
   A (1), L (2), A (3) -> but we have A in position 3? We know A cannot be in position 3? So invalid? 

 How about ""AUDIO"" without R? Not allowed? 

 How about ""AORTA""? 
   A (1), O (2), R (3) -> but R in position 3? We know R cannot be in position 3? Because from ""party"", R was in position 3 and wrong? So invalid.

 How about ""AISLE""? But E is eliminated? 

 How about ""ALIKE""? But E and K? We haven't eliminated K? But E is eliminated? 

 How about ""ALIBI""? 
   A (1), L (2), I (3), B (4), I (5) -> but we don't have R? 

 We must include R? 

 How about ""AEGIS""? But E is eliminated? 

 So I think the best option is to put A and R in the last two positions? 

 Therefore, I choose ""SOLAR"". 

 But note: we have to make sure we are not repeating the same mistake? 

 In ""SOLAR"":
   Position 1: S -> new
   Position 2: O -> new
   Position 3: L -> new
   Position 4: A -> we are testing A in position 4? 
   Position 5: R -> we are testing R in position 5? 

 We know A cannot be in 2 or 3? So 4 is okay? 
 We know R cannot be in 2 or 3? So 5 is okay? 

 And we are testing three new letters? 

 So let's go with ""SOLAR"". 

 But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know? But we haven't seen any? 

 Alternatively, we can try ""LABOR"": 
   L (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""ROBIN"": but N is eliminated? 

 How about ""ROGUE"": but E is eliminated? 

 How about ""RADIO"": 
   R (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""RABID"": 
   R (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""RACER"": but C and E are eliminated? 

 So I think ""SOLAR"" is a good choice? 

 But let me check if there is a word that uses more common letters? 

 Another idea: ""SAUCE""? But C and E are eliminated? 

 How about ""SALAD""? 
   S (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""SALSA""? 
   S (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""SALON""? N eliminated? 

 How about ""SALVO"": 
   S (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""SABER"": E eliminated? 

 How about ""SABRA"": 
   S (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? 

 So I think we have to avoid position 2 for A? 

 Therefore, I will go with ""SOLAR"". 

 Guess: ""SOLAR""

 Format: <guess>solar</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Eliminated Letters**: C, N, E, P, T, Y (not in the word at all).
- **Confirmed Letters**: A and R are in the word, but their positions are incorrect in both prior guesses:
  - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from ""party"" and ""crane"" feedback).
  - R cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from ""crane"" and ""party"" feedback).
- **Remaining Possibilities**: A must be in position 1, 4, or 5; R must be in position 1, 4, or 5. The word has 3 additional unknown letters.

For this guess, I chose **""solar""** because:
- It places A in position 4 and R in position 5—both untested positions that fit the constraints.
- It tests 3 new common letters (S, O, L) to gather more information.
- It avoids all eliminated letters and adheres to positional rules.

<guess>solar</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) R(-) T(x) Y(x)
Guess 3: solar -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(-) L(-) A(-) R(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the third guess ""solar"":
 S(x) : S is not in the secret word.
 O(-) : O is in the secret word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2).
 L(-) : L is in the secret word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
 A(-) : A is in the secret word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4).
 R(-) : R is in the secret word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5).

 Now, combining with previous feedback:

 Eliminated letters: C, N, E, P, T, Y, S (from this guess). So total eliminated: C, E, N, P, T, Y, S.

 Confirmed letters in the word: A, R (from before), and now also O and L are confirmed to be in the word.

 So the secret word contains: A, R, O, L. And one more letter? Because it's 5 letters? We have 4 confirmed: A, R, O, L. So there is one more letter to find.

 But note: the feedback for ""solar"" shows that all five letters in the guess are either not in the word (S) or in the word but wrong position (O, L, A, R). Since S is not in the word, we have O, L, A, R in the word? But we already knew A and R? Now we know O and L are also in the word? 

 However, wait: the word has 5 letters. We have 4 letters: A, R, O, L. So the fifth letter is missing? 

 But the feedback says that O, L, A, R are in the word? So the secret word must have at least these four? And one more? 

 But it could have duplicates? However, we have no indication of duplicates so far? 

 Alternatively, the secret word might have exactly these four and one duplicate? But we don't know.

 But let's assume for now that there are no duplicates? Then the secret word has 5 distinct letters: A, R, O, L, and one more.

 We also have positional constraints:

 From previous guesses:

 For A:
   - Not in position 2 (from ""party"" guess: A in position 2 was wrong)
   - Not in position 3 (from ""crane"" guess: A in position 3 was wrong)
   - Not in position 4 (from ""solar"" guess: A in position 4 was wrong)

 Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 5? (since positions 2,3,4 are ruled out)

 For R:
   - Not in position 2 (from ""crane"")
   - Not in position 3 (from ""party"")
   - Not in position 5 (from ""solar"": R in position 5 was wrong)

 Therefore, R must be in position 1 or 4? (positions 2,3,5 are ruled out)

 For O:
   - From ""solar"": O was in position 2 and it was wrong? So O is not in position 2.

 For L:
   - From ""solar"": L was in position 3 and it was wrong? So L is not in position 3.

 Now, we also know that the secret word has one more letter? Let's call it X? We don't know X.

 We need to form a 5-letter word with letters: A, R, O, L, X? Where X is a letter not eliminated? 

 Eliminated letters: C, E, N, P, T, Y, S.

 Available letters: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Z? But note: O is already in the word? So we are looking for one more letter? 

 But wait: the word must have 5 distinct letters? We don't know? But we haven't encountered duplicates? So let's assume distinct.

 Now, we have to assign positions:

 Positions: 1,2,3,4,5

 Constraints:
   A: position 1 or 5
   R: position 1 or 4
   O: not position 2
   L: not position 3

 Also, note: if R is in position 1, then A cannot be in position 1? So if R is in 1, then A must be in 5? 
   Similarly, if R is in 4, then A can be in 1 or 5? 

 But also, we have to place O and L and X.

 Let me consider the two cases for R:

 Case 1: R in position 1.
   Then A must be in position 5 (since A cannot be in 1 if R is there? And the only other option for A is 5).
   Then we have positions 2,3,4 to fill with O, L, and X.

   Constraints for O: not in 2? But we can put O in 3 or 4? 
   Constraints for L: not in 3? So L can be in 2 or 4? 

   But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters? 

   Also, we have to form a valid word.

   Example: R _ _ _ A

   We need to fill positions 2,3,4 with O, L, and X? 

   How about: R O L _ A? But then L is in position 3? But L cannot be in position 3? So that's invalid.

   How about: R O _ L A? Then O in position 2? But O cannot be in position 2? So that's invalid.

   How about: R L _ O A? 
        Position 2: L -> allowed? (L can be in 2? because we only know it cannot be in 3)
        Position 3: ? 
        Position 4: O -> allowed? (O can be in 4? because we only know it cannot be in 2)

   So we have R, L, ?, O, A.

   The word must be valid? What words are there? 

   Example: ""RULOA""? Not a word.

   How about ""RADIO""? But we have A and D? But D is not in the word? And we have O? But we have R in 1, A in 5? But in ""RADIO"", A is in 2? Not 5? 

   We need a word that ends with A? 

   Example: ""ROTLA""? Not a word.

   How about ""ROULA""? Not a word.

   How about ""RHYLA""? Not a word.

   This seems difficult? 

 Case 2: R in position 4.
   Then A can be in position 1 or 5.

   Subcase 2a: A in position 1.
        Word: A _ _ R ?

        The last position must be the fifth letter? But we have O, L, and X to place? 

        Positions: 
          1: A
          2: ? 
          3: ?
          4: R
          5: ?

        We have to place O, L, and X in positions 2,3,5? 

        Constraints: 
          O: not in 2? So O can be in 3 or 5?
          L: not in 3? So L can be in 2 or 5?

        Example: A L O R ? -> but then we have to put X in position 5? But we have only one spot? And we have two letters? Wait, no: we have three letters to place? But we have three positions? 

        Actually, we have to assign O, L, and X to positions 2,3,5? 

        How about: 
          Position 2: L? -> allowed? 
          Position 3: O? -> allowed? (O can be in 3? because we only know it cannot be in 2)
          Position 5: X? 

        But then we have a word: A L O R X? 

        But we need a valid word? 

        Example: ""ALOR X"" -> not a word? 

        How about: 
          Position 2: X (the unknown)
          Position 3: L? -> but L cannot be in 3? So invalid.

        How about:
          Position 2: X
          Position 3: O? -> allowed? 
          Position 5: L? -> allowed? 

        Then word: A X O R L? 

        Example: ""AXORL"" not a word.

        How about:
          Position 2: O? -> but O cannot be in 2? So invalid.

        How about:
          Position 2: L? -> allowed? 
          Position 3: X? 
          Position 5: O? -> allowed? 

        Word: A L X R O? 

        Example: ""ALXRO"" not a word.

        How about:
          Position 2: X
          Position 3: ? -> we have to put either O or L? But O can be in 3? and L cannot be in 3? So we put O in 3? 
          Position 5: L? 

        Word: A X O R L? -> not a word.

   Subcase 2b: A in position 5.
        Word: ? _ _ R A

        We have to fill positions 1,2,3 with O, L, and X? 

        Constraints:
          O: not in 2? So O can be in 1 or 3?
          L: not in 3? So L can be in 1 or 2?

        Example: 
          Position 1: O? -> allowed? 
          Position 2: L? -> allowed? (L can be in 2? because we only know it cannot be in 3)
          Position 3: X? 
          Then word: O L X R A? 

        Example: ""OLXRA"" not a word.

        How about:
          Position 1: L? 
          Position 2: O? -> but O cannot be in 2? So invalid.

        How about:
          Position 1: O? 
          Position 2: X? 
          Position 3: L? -> but L cannot be in 3? So invalid.

        How about:
          Position 1: X? 
          Position 2: O? -> invalid (O cannot be in 2)
          Position 3: L? -> invalid (L cannot be in 3)

        How about:
          Position 1: L? 
          Position 2: X? 
          Position 3: O? -> allowed? (O can be in 3? because we only know it cannot be in 2)

        Then word: L X O R A? 

        Example: ""LXORA"" not a word.

        How about:
          Position 1: O? 
          Position 2: L? -> allowed? 
          Position 3: X? 
          Then word: O L X R A? 

        Example: ""OLXRA"" not a word.

 This is getting difficult? Maybe we need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? 

 Alternatively, we might have missed that the secret word has only 4 distinct letters? For example, one letter repeated? 

 Let me reexamine the feedback.

 In the third guess ""solar"", we had:
   S (x) -> not in word
   O (-) -> in word, wrong position
   L (-) -> in word, wrong position
   A (-) -> in word, wrong position
   R (-) -> in word, wrong position

 This means that the secret word contains O, L, A, R? But it might have a duplicate of one of these? Or it might have a fifth letter that is one of these? 

 But note: we have five positions? And we have four letters? So there must be a duplicate? 

 Therefore, the secret word has at least one duplicate letter? 

 Which letter is duplicated? It could be A, R, O, or L? 

 Now, let's think about the first guess ""crane"": 
   C (x), R (-), A (-), N (x), E (x)

 And second guess ""party"":
   P (x), A (-), R (-), T (x), Y (x)

 In ""crane"", we had R and A? And in ""party"", we had A and R? And in ""solar"", we had O, L, A, R? 

 If there is a duplicate, then one of these letters appears twice? 

 How can we find out which one? 

 We can try to consider the positions again? 

 But we have constraints on positions? 

 Let me list the positions we know are invalid for each letter:

 A: cannot be in 2,3,4 (from positions in ""party"", ""crane"", ""solar"")
    So A must be in 1 or 5.

 R: cannot be in 2,3,5 (from ""crane"", ""party"", ""solar"")
    So R must be in 1 or 4.

 O: cannot be in 2 (from ""solar"")
    So O can be in 1,3,4,5.

 L: cannot be in 3 (from ""solar"")
    So L can be in 1,2,4,5.

 Now, if there is a duplicate, then one of these letters appears twice? 

 We have to form a word that has five letters from {A, R, O, L} with one duplicate? 

 The word must have exactly five letters? So one letter appears twice? 

 Let me try to assign positions:

 We have two cases for R: position 1 or 4.

 Case 1: R in position 1.
   Then A must be in position 5? (because A cannot be in 1 if R is there? and A can only be in 1 or 5? so 5)
   Then we have positions 2,3,4 to fill? 

   We have to use two of {O, L} and one duplicate of either A, R, O, or L? 

   But R is already used? And A is at the end? 

   So the duplicate could be R? But R is at position 1? Then we need another R? 
   Or duplicate of A? But A is at position 5? Then we need another A? 
   Or duplicate of O or L? 

   Let me try duplicate of O? Then we have two O's and one L? 

   Positions 2,3,4: we need to assign two O's and one L? 

   But constraints:
        O: not in 2? So O cannot be in position 2? 
        L: not in 3? 

   So if we put L in position 2? Then we can put O in 3 and 4? 
        Word: R (1), L (2), O (3), O (4), A (5) -> ""RLOOA""? Not a word.

   If we put L in position 4? Then we put O in 2? But O cannot be in 2? So invalid.

   If we put L in position 3? But L cannot be in 3? 

   So duplicate of O doesn't work.

   Duplicate of L? Then we have two L's and one O? 
        Positions 2,3,4: two L's and one O? 
        But L cannot be in 3? So we cannot put L in position 3? 
        So we must put L in positions 2 and 4? 
        Then O in position 3? 
        Word: R (1), L (2), O (3), L (4), A (5) -> ""RLOLA""? Not a word.

   Duplicate of A? Then we have two A's? But A is already in position 5? So we need another A in positions 2,3, or 4? 
        But A cannot be in 2,3,4? Because we have feedback that A is not in 2,3,4? 
        So impossible.

   Duplicate of R? Then we have two R's? One at position 1, and another in positions 2,3,4? 
        But R cannot be in 2 or 3? So it must be in position 4? 
        Then we have R at 1 and 4? 
        Then positions 2 and 3: we have to put O and L? 
        Constraints: 
            O: not in 2? So O must be in 3? 
            L: not in 3? So L must be in 2? 
        Word: R (1), L (2), O (3), R (4), A (5) -> ""RLORA""? Not a word.

 Case 2: R in position 4.
   Then A can be in 1 or 5.

   Subcase 2a: A in position 1.
        Word: A _ _ R ?
        Positions 2,3,5 to fill? (since position 4 is R)

        We have to use two of {O, L} and one duplicate? 

        The duplicate could be A, R, O, L.

        But A is at 1? So if duplicate of A, then we need another A? But A cannot be in 2,3,4? and 5 is available? But we have position 5 available? 
            So we could put A in position 5? But then we have two A's? 
            Then positions 2 and 3: we put O and L? 
            Constraints:
                O: not in 2? -> so O in 3? 
                L: not in 3? -> so L in 2? 
            Word: A (1), L (2), O (3), R (4), A (5) -> ""ALORA""? Is that a word? ""Alora"" is a proper name? But we need a common word? 

        Let me check: ""alora"" is not in the standard word list? 

        Duplicate of R? But R is at 4? Then we need another R? 
            We can put R in position 2,3, or 5? 
            But R cannot be in 2 or 3? (from feedback) and also not in 5? (from ""solar"" feedback: R in 5 was wrong) -> so R cannot be in 2,3,5? and 4 is already used? So duplicate of R would require a third R? Not possible.

        Duplicate of O? Then we have two O's and one L? 
            Positions 2,3,5: assign two O's and one L? 
            Constraints:
                O: not in 2? -> so O cannot be in 2? 
                L: not in 3? 
            So we can put:
                Option: L in 2, O in 3, O in 5? -> ""A L O R O"" -> ""ALORO""? not a word.
                Option: O in 3, L in 5, O in ? -> wait, we have only three positions? 
                We have to use two O's: so one O in 3 and one in 5? and L in 2? -> ""A L O R O"" -> ""ALORO"" not a word.
                Or O in 5 and O in 3? and L in 2? same as above.

        Duplicate of L? Then we have two L's and one O? 
            Positions 2,3,5: 
                L cannot be in 3? 
                O cannot be in 2? 
            So we can put:
                L in 2, O in 5, and L in ? -> but we have only three positions? 
                We need to place two L's and one O? 
                If L in 2, then the other L cannot be in 3? so must be in 5? but then O must be in 3? 
                Word: A (1), L (2), O (3), R (4), L (5) -> ""ALORL""? not a word.

   Subcase 2b: A in position 5.
        Word: ? _ _ R A
        Positions 1,2,3 to fill? 

        We have to use two of {O, L} and one duplicate? 

        The duplicate could be A, R, O, L.

        But A is at 5? so duplicate of A would require another A? But A cannot be in 2,3,4? and position 1 is available? 
            So we could put A in position 1? 
            Then word: A (1), ? (2), ? (3), R (4), A (5) -> but then we have two A's? 
            Then positions 2 and 3: O and L? 
            Constraints:
                O: not in 2? -> so O in 3? 
                L: not in 3? -> so L in 2? 
            Word: A (1), L (2), O (3), R (4), A (5) -> ""ALORA"" again? 

        Duplicate of R? R is at 4? then another R? 
            R cannot be in 1,2,3,5? (because not in 2,3,5 from feedback, and 4 is taken) -> so impossible.

        Duplicate of O? 
            Positions 1,2,3: two O's and one L? 
            O cannot be in 2? 
            L cannot be in 3? 
            So we can put:
                O in 1, L in 2, O in 3? -> but L in 2 is allowed? O in 3 is allowed? 
                Word: O (1), L (2), O (3), R (4), A (5) -> ""OLORA""? not a word.

                O in 1, O in 3, L in 2? -> same as above.

                Or O in 3, L in 1, O in ? -> but then we have to put the second O somewhere? 
                If L in 1, O in 3, then the second O must be in 2? but O cannot be in 2? -> invalid.

        Duplicate of L? 
            Positions 1,2,3: two L's and one O? 
            L cannot be in 3? 
            O cannot be in 2? 
            So we can put:
                L in 1, O in 3, L in 2? -> but O in 3 is allowed? L in 2 is allowed? 
                Word: L (1), L (2), O (3), R (4), A (5) -> ""LLORA""? not a word.

                L in 1, L in 2, O in 3? -> ""LLORA"" again.

                L in 1, O in 2? -> but O cannot be in 2? invalid.

                O in 1, L in 2, L in 3? -> but L cannot be in 3? invalid.

 So we are struggling to find a word? 

 Perhaps ""ALORA"" is accepted? Or maybe we missed a word? 

 Let me think of common words that have A, R, O, L and one duplicate? 

 How about ""ROYAL""? But Y is eliminated? 

 How about ""FOCAL""? But F and C? C is eliminated? 

 How about ""LOYAL""? 
   L, O, Y, A, L -> but Y is eliminated? 

 How about ""LORAL""? 
   L, O, R, A, L -> but that's L,O,R,A,L -> positions: 
   We have two L's? 
   Let me see if it fits: 
        We need to place: 
          A: must be in 1 or 5? In ""LORAL"", A is in position 4? But we know A cannot be in 4? So invalid.

 How about ""ORALS""? but S is eliminated? 

 How about ""MORAL""? 
   M, O, R, A, L -> distinct letters? 
   But we have M? 
   Let's see the positions:
        A is in position 4? But we know A cannot be in 4? 

 How about ""MOLAR""? 
   M, O, L, A, R -> distinct? 
   Positions:
        A is in position 4? again not allowed? 

 How about ""SOLAR"" we already guessed? 

 We need to consider that the feedback might allow ""ALORA"" or similar? 

 But let me think: is there a word like ""LARVA""? 
   L, A, R, V, A -> duplicate A? 
   Positions: 
        A in position 2 and 5? 
        But we know A cannot be in 2? 

 How about ""AROMA""? 
   A, R, O, M, A -> duplicate A? 
   Positions: 
        A in 1 and 5? 
        R in 2? -> but R cannot be in 2? 

 How about ""RADAR""? 
   R, A, D, A, R -> duplicate R and A? 
   Positions: 
        R in 1 and 5? -> R in 5 is not allowed? 
        A in 2 and 4? -> A in 2 and 4 are not allowed? 

 How about ""LABOR""? 
   L, A, B, O, R -> distinct? 
   Positions: 
        A in 2? -> not allowed? 

 How about ""BARON""? N eliminated? 

 How about ""CAROL""? C eliminated? 

 How about ""DROLL""? 
   D, R, O, L, L -> duplicate L? 
   Positions: 
        R in 2? -> not allowed? 

 How about ""FLOAT""? T eliminated? 

 How about ""GLOAT""? T eliminated? 

 How about ""BROAD""? 
   B, R, O, A, D -> distinct? 
   Positions: 
        R in 2? -> not allowed? 

 How about ""DOGMA""? 
   D, O, G, M, A -> distinct? 
   But we don't have R? 

 We must have R? 

 How about ""DRAMA""? 
   D, R, A, M, A -> duplicate A? 
   Positions: 
        R in 2? -> not allowed? 

 How about ""LAMPS""? S and P eliminated? 

 I am considering that the secret word might be ""oral"" something? 

 Another idea: the word ""LORDS""? but S eliminated? 

 Perhaps we missed a possibility: in the first guess, we had ""crane"", and R was in position 2 and it was wrong position, but that doesn't mean R is not in position 2 for other occurrences? But no, because the feedback is per letter, not per occurrence. In Wordle, if there is a duplicate, the feedback might be complex? 

 But in our feedback, for ""solar"", we have R in position 5 and it was marked wrong position, which means that either there is another R that is not in position 5, or if there is only one R, then it's not in 5. 

 Given the difficulty, let's try to guess a word that tests the possibility of A in position 1 and R in position 4, with common letters in the other positions? 

 We know the word has O and L as well? 

 So let's try ""ALERT""? but E and T are eliminated? 

 How about ""ADORE""? E eliminated? 

 How about ""ABHOR""? 
   A, B, H, O, R -> distinct? 
   Positions: 
        A in 1? -> allowed? 
        B in 2? 
        H in 3? 
        O in 4? -> but we have R in position 5? 
        R in 5? -> but R cannot be in 5? 

 In ""ABHOR"", R is in position 5? which is not allowed? 

 How about ""ABHOR"" with R in position 4? But the word is A,B,H,O,R -> R is at 5? 

 How about ""ARMOR""? 
   A, R, M, O, R -> duplicate R? 
   Positions: 
        A in 1? -> allowed? 
        R in 2? -> not allowed? 

 How about ""ARMOR"" with A in 1, R in 1? not possible. 

 How about ""RASER""? not a word. 

 I think we need to try a word that has A in position 5 and R in position 4, and then for position 1,2,3: we try to use O and L and one new letter? 

 For example, ""??R A"" with the first three positions filled with O, L, and a new letter? 

 But we have to avoid the eliminated letters. 

 Let me try: 
   Position 1: O? -> allowed? 
   Position 2: L? -> allowed? (L can be in 2) 
   Position 3: ? (new letter, say D) 
   Position 4: R 
   Position 5: A 
   Word: O L D R A -> ""OLDRA"" not a word.

   Position 1: L? 
   Position 2: O? -> not allowed (O cannot be in 2) 
   invalid.

   Position 1: D? 
   Position 2: O? -> not allowed 
   invalid.

   Position 1: O? 
   Position 2: D? 
   Position 3: L? -> not allowed (L cannot be in 3) 
   invalid.

   Position 1: L? 
   Position 2: D? 
   Position 3: O? -> allowed? 
   Position 4: R 
   Position 5: A 
   Word: L D O R A -> ""LDORA"" not a word.

   Position 1: D? 
   Position 2: L? -> allowed? 
   Position 3: O? -> allowed? 
   Word: D L O R A -> ""DLORA"" not a word.

 So not working. 

 Perhaps the word is ""LARVA""? but A in position 2 is not allowed. 

 Let me try to ignore the distinct letters assumption. 

 We know the word has at least A, R, O, L. And one of them is repeated. 

 We have feedback from ""solar"": 
   O in position 2: wrong position -> so there is an O not in position 2? 
   L in position 3: wrong position -> so there is an L not in position 3? 
   A in position 4: wrong position -> so there is an A not in position 4? 
   R in position 5: wrong position -> so there is an R not in position 5? 

 If there is a duplicate, then the feedback might be for one of the occurrences. 

 For example, if the word has two A's, then one A might be in a correct position and the other in wrong? But the feedback for ""solar"" has A in position 4 and it's marked wrong, so at least the A in position 4 is not correct. If there is another A, it might be in a correct position? 

 But in our earlier constraints, we have that A cannot be in 2,3,4? so the only possibility for a correct A is position 1 or 5. 

 Similarly for R: cannot be in 2,3,5? so only position 1 or 4. 

 Let's try to assume that the word has two A's. Then one A must be in 1 or 5, and the other A must be in the other of 1 or 5, or in a position that is not 2,3,4? but there are only positions 1 and 5 available for A? so both A's must be in 1 and 5? 

 Then the word starts and ends with A? 

 So the word is A _ _ _ A 

 And we know R is in the word, and must be in position 4? (because R can only be in 1 or 4, but position 1 is A, so R in 4) 

 Then the word is A _ _ R A 

 Now, we have to fill positions 2 and 3 with O and L? because we know O and L are in the word? 

 But we have only two positions? and two letters? 

 Constraints: 
   O: not in 2? 
   L: not in 3? 

 So we can put:
   Option 1: O in 3, L in 2? 
        Word: A L O R A -> ""ALORA"" 

   Option 2: L in 2, O in 3? -> same as above.

   Option 3: We might have duplicates of O or L? but we have only two positions? 

 So the only possibility is ""ALORA"". 

 Is ""ALORA"" a word? 

 Upon checking, ""Alora"" is a proper name, but in the context of Wordle, it might be accepted? Or maybe not. 

 Alternatively, in some word lists, it might be included. 

 Given the constraints, I think we should try ""ALORA"". 

 So I will guess ""ALORA"". 

 But note: we have not used any new letters? We are only using A, L, O, R. 

 And we are assuming two A's. 

 If it's not a word, then we may have to try something else. 

 But let's try. 

 Guess: ""ALORA""

 Format: <guess>alora</guess>After analyzing the feedback from all guesses:

- **Eliminated Letters**: C, E, N, P, T, Y, S (not in the word).
- **Confirmed Letters**: A, R, O, L (all are in the word but misplaced in prior guesses).
- **Positional Constraints**:
  - A: Cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (must be in 1 or 5).
  - R: Cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (must be in 1 or 4).
  - O: Cannot be in position 2.
  - L: Cannot be in position 3.
- **Key Insight**: The word must contain at least one duplicate letter (since only 4 unique letters are confirmed for a 5-letter word). Given positional constraints, the only feasible solution is a duplicate ""A"" (since A must occupy positions 1 and 5 to satisfy all constraints), with R in position 4, and O and L in positions 2 and 3.

The word **""ALORA""** fits all criteria:
- A in position 1 (allowed) and 5 (allowed).
- R in position 4 (allowed).
- L in position 2 (allowed, as L can be in 2).
- O in position 3 (allowed, as O can be in 3).
- Satisfies feedback: A, L, O, R are in the word but not in positions tested in prior guesses.

In ""crane"", R was the second letter and A was the third.\n\n Since R was in the second position in the guess and it\'s marked wrong position, that means R is either in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 in the secret word? Let me note the positions:\n Position 1: C -> x\n Position 2: R -> - (so R is in the word but not in position 2)\n Position 3: A -> - (so A is in the word but not in position 3)\n Position 4: N -> x\n Position 5: E -> x\n\n We know the word has 5 letters and must contain R and A, but exclude C, N, E.\n\n Also, since R and A are present but in wrong positions, let us try to think of words that have R and A, without C, N, E.\n\n Now, we have to make a second guess. We want a word that:\n   - Does not contain R in position 2 or A in position 3.\n   - Does not contain C, N, E at all.\n\n Additionally, we might want to reuse other letters to test for more common consonants? But note: we don\'t know what other letters might be in the word.\n\n Since we know A is in the word, let\'s try to place A in a different position. Similarly for R.\n\n Possibilities for R: We can try putting R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, any except 2.\n Similarly, A: any except 3.\n\n We also don\'t know other letters. So, we can try a word that includes other common letters not yet tested? Such as T, S, L, etc.\n\n Important: We must avoid C, N, E.\n\n Let\'s think of words that have R, A, and maybe some new letters.\n\n Since we have only eliminated three letters (C, N, E) and the word has five letters, we have many possibilities.\n\n We can try a word with R in the first position? But note: if we put R in the first position, then we might get more information quickly.\n\n Some common words: \n\n Example: ""RATIO""? But we don\'t know if O, I, T are in the word. Also, note that we haven\'t tested I, O, T. But wait, A is in ""RATIO"" and it\'s in position 2? We cannot have A in position 3? Actually, in ""RATIO"", A is in position 2. We don\'t know about position 2 for A yet? Only that in the previous guess A was in position 3 and that was wrong. So A might be in position 2? \n\n However, the feedback only said that when A was in position 3 it was wrong. So A could be in position 2? Similarly, R was in position 2 and that was wrong, but R could be in any other position.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that puts A in position 1 and R in position 4 or 5? \n\n Let me compile a list of common letters that we haven\'t eliminated: the alphabet without C, N, E: \n ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ without C, N, E -> leaves: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\n We know A and R are in the word. So we need to guess with A and R, plus three other letters that we haven\'t tried.\n\n We haven\'t tried many. We can try:\n\n Let me think of words that have A and R and avoid C,N,E.\n\n Possible words: \n   - ""PARTY"": has P,A,R,T,Y -> avoids C,N,E.\n   - ""FARTS"": avoids C,N,E? But we might not want to guess that... \n   - ""STARK"": S,T,A,R,K -> avoids C,N,E.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to use different positions.\n\n We have:\n   - Position 2: we now know it\'s not R? But we don\'t know what is in position two? Actually, we know that the secret word has A and R, and the first guess had C in position 1 which was wrong.\n\n Another idea: We also know that in the first guess, the letter in position 1 was incorrect (so not C), position 2 was R but wrong (so the secret word does not have R at position 2), position 3 was A but wrong (so secret word does not have A at position 3), position 4 was N (wrong and not in the word) and position 5 was E (wrong and not in the word).\n\n Let me think of a word that has:\n   - R in position 1,4, or 5? \n   - A in position 1,2,4, or 5? \n\n And we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Option: ""ROAST"": This word has R, O, A, S, T. It avoids C,N,E. But note:\n   Position 1: R -> we are testing R in position 1? Also, in the secret word, R might be in position 1? \n   Position 2: O -> new letter\n   Position 3: A -> but we know from previous feedback that A cannot be in position 3! So that would be a bad choice because we know the secret word does not have A in position 3. \n\n Therefore, we cannot try a word that has A in position 3? Or R in position 2? We must avoid the positions we know they are not.\n\n So ""ROAST"" is invalid for this because A is forced into position 3? But we know it\'s not in position 3. So we skip that.\n\n Alternatively, ""RATIO"": Has R at position 1, A at position 2, T, I, O. \n   Position 3: T -> unknown\n   Position 4: I -> unknown\n   Position 5: O -> unknown\n\n But we don\'t know if the secret word has T,I,O. And we avoid C,N,E.\n\n Alternatively, ""STAIR"": S,T,A,I,R. \n   Positions: \n     1: S\n     2: T\n     3: A -> we know A cannot be in position 3? So that\'s bad.\n\n How about ""TRIAL"": T,R,I,A,L? \n   Position 1: T\n   Position 2: R -> but we know that R should not be in position 2? Because in the first guess R was in position 2 and it was wrong. So we must avoid R in position 2? Therefore, ""TRIAL"" is invalid.\n\n So we avoid both R in position 2 and A in position 3.\n\n Another idea: ""PARTY"": \n   P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)\n   Now: \n      A is in position 2 -> not position 3? That\'s okay because the rule about A was only that it was wrong in position 3, but we don\'t know about other positions? \n      Similarly, R is in position 3 -> which is different from position 2? So that\'s okay.\n\n However, note: We don\'t know if position 3 is okay for R? The feedback only said that when R was in position 2 it was wrong. So R could be in position 3? Similarly, A is in position 2? It wasn\'t tested in position 2 before? Actually, we have no information about position 2 for A? Because the first guess had A only in position 3.\n\n Therefore, ""PARTY"" is a valid guess.\n\n Why is it valid?\n   - It has A and R? (Yes)\n   - A is in position 2? Which wasn\'t tested? So that might be correct? Or might be wrong? We don\'t know.\n   - R is in position 3? Which we don\'t know? \n\n We are testing R in a new position? And A in a new position? Also, introducing P, T, Y? \n\n Alternatively, we could choose a word that places A and R in positions we haven\'t tested? But actually, we haven\'t tested any other positions? Only we know position 2 and position 3 in the first guess? \n\n However, we have two letters that must be in the word: R and A. \n\n I think ""PARTY"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""STRAY"": \n   S (1), T (2), R (3), A (4), Y (5) \n   This avoids R in position 2 and A in position 3? Yes? \n   Also, the letters S,T,R,A,Y? All new? \n\n How about ""TRAPS"": \n   T (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? Because first feedback said R is not in position 2? So that would be invalid.\n\n How about ""RADAR"": \n   R (1), A (2), D (3), A (4), R (5). \n   But note: the word has duplicate R and A? We don\'t know if the secret word has duplicates? We haven\'t been told? The rules don\'t say that the word has distinct letters? But Wordle typically allows repeated letters? So that\'s possible? \n\n But note the feedback: In the first guess, each letter was evaluated independently? And we only know that the secret word must have at least one R and at least one A? It could have more? \n\n However, to keep it simple, maybe we avoid duplicates for now? \n\n Alternatively, let me think: We want to maximize information? \n\n Considering the above, let me propose ""STRAY"".\n\n But note: we might have a problem? In ""STRAY"", the R is in position 3 and A is in position 4. \n\n Other options: ""RAYON""? But ""RAYON"" has Y and O? But we haven\'t tested? But note: ""RAYON"" avoids C,N,E? But wait, N is eliminated? Oh, ""RAYON"" has N? Which we know is not in the word? Because first feedback said N is not in the word? -> So ""RAYON"" is invalid? Because it contains N? So we must avoid N?\n\n Therefore, we cannot choose ""RAYON"".\n\n Let me stick with ""STRAY"". \n\n Now, ""STRAY"":\n   S -> new, not tested? So it\'s safe? \n   T -> new?\n   R -> we know is in the word? So we are testing R at position 3?\n   A -> at position 4? \n   Y -> new.\n\n We don\'t have any constraints against position 3 for R? Or position 4 for A? Since the only constraints are R not at 2 and A not at 3? \n\n So ""STRAY"" seems okay.\n\n Alternatively, ""PARTY"" also seems okay, but using P? \n\n Since we don\'t know, I\'m going to choose ""PARTY"" because it introduces P, T, Y? Which might be helpful? \n\n But let me think: T is a common letter? \n\n I\'ll go with ""PARTY"".\n\n So the guess is ""PARTY"".\n\n Format: <guess>party</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.\n- R and A **are** in the secret word, but they were in incorrect positions (R was position 2, A was position 3).\n\nFor my next guess:\n- Must include R and A (since they are confirmed in the word).\n- Avoid C, N, E entirely.\n- Position R anywhere except position 2 (since feedback showed R is not in position 2).\n- Position A anywhere except position 3 (since feedback showed A is not in position 3).\n- Test new common consonants like T, P, and Y to gather more information.\n\nI chose **""party""**:\n- P (position 1): Untested letter to probe potential positions.\n- A (position 2): Tests A in a new position given it can\'t be position 3.\n- R (position 3): Tests R in a new position given it can\'t be position 2.\n- T (position 4): Untested letter.\n- Y (position 5): Untested letter.\n\nThis maximizes information by testing A/R in new positions while introducing 3 new letters (P, T, Y).\n\n<guess>party</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) R(-) T(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the second guess ""party"":\n P(x) : P is not in the secret word.\n A(-) : A is in the secret word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2).\n R(-) : R is in the secret word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).\n T(x) : T is not in the secret word.\n Y(x) : Y is not in the secret word.\n\n Now, combining with the first guess ""crane"" feedback:\n   - C, N, E, P, T, Y are not in the word. (Eliminated letters: C, N, E, P, T, Y)\n   - The word contains A and R, but not in the positions we\'ve tried so far.\n\n Specifically, from ""crane"":\n     Position 2: R was wrong -> so R is not in position 2.\n     Position 3: A was wrong -> so A is not in position 3.\n\n From ""party"":\n     Position 2: A was wrong -> so A is not in position 2.\n     Position 3: R was wrong -> so R is not in position 3.\n\n Therefore, we know:\n   - A cannot be in position 2 or 3.\n   - R cannot be in position 2 or 3.\n\n Since the word is 5 letters, the possible positions for A are 1, 4, or 5.\n Similarly, the possible positions for R are 1, 4, or 5.\n\n But note: we have two letters that must be placed in positions 1,4,5? And we have three positions? So they could be in two of these three positions? Or one of them might be in one and the other in another? \n\n Also, we have eliminated 6 letters: C, N, E, P, T, Y.\n\n We still need to find the remaining three letters? Because the word has 5 letters and we know two of them (A and R), so three more.\n\n We haven\'t tested many letters. We can try to use other common letters.\n\n The remaining letters that are possible: \n   Alphabet without eliminated: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,Q,R,S,U,V,W,X,Z\n\n But note: we know A and R are in the word, so we are looking for three more from the above set.\n\n We also have constraints on the positions of A and R.\n\n Let me think of words that have A and R, and three other letters from the remaining, and place A and R in positions 1,4,5? But not in 2 or 3.\n\n Also, we must avoid the positions we know they are not? \n\n Possibilities for A: positions 1,4,5\n Possibilities for R: positions 1,4,5\n\n But note: they cannot be in the same position? So if we put A in position 1, then R can be in 4 or 5? Similarly, if A in 4, R in 1 or 5? Etc.\n\n We need to test as many new letters as possible? \n\n Let me try to form a word:\n\n Option 1: Put A in position 1? Then we can have a word like ""A _ _ _ R"" or ""A _ _ R _"", but note the positions for R: 4 or 5? \n\n But we also have to fill the other positions? \n\n Option 2: Put R in position 1? Then A in 4 or 5? \n\n Since we don\'t know, we can try to test both? But we have to choose one.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and R in positions 4 and 5? \n\n Example: \n   If we put A in 4 and R in 5: then the word ends with ""AR"". \n   Or A in 5 and R in 4: then the word ends with ""RA"".\n\n We can also try to test common letters in the middle.\n\n Let me think of words that have A and R in the last two positions? \n\n For example: \n   ""SOLAR"": S,O,L,A,R -> but note: A is in position 4, R in position 5? \n   But we haven\'t tested S, O, L? \n\n However, we have to avoid the eliminated letters? S, O, L are not eliminated? \n\n But wait: we have eliminated C,N,E,P,T,Y? So S, O, L are okay.\n\n But let\'s check the positions: \n   In ""SOLAR"": \n      Position 1: S\n      Position 2: O\n      Position 3: L\n      Position 4: A -> which is allowed? Because A can be in 4? \n      Position 5: R -> allowed? \n\n However, we also have to consider that we don\'t know if the secret word has S, O, L? \n\n But we are testing them? \n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and R in the first and last? \n\n Example: ""R _ _ A _"" -> R in 1 and A in 4? Then the word is R ? ? A ? \n\n How about ""ROBOT""? But we have O and B? But note: we have eliminated T? So ""ROBOT"" has T? Which is eliminated? So not allowed.\n\n How about ""RADII""? But we have D and I? But also, we have A in position 2? But we know A cannot be in position 2? Because from the second guess, A was in position 2 and it was wrong? So we cannot put A in position 2? \n\n Therefore, if we put R in position 1, then A must be in position 4 or 5? \n\n Similarly, if we put A in position 1, then R must be in 4 or 5? \n\n So let me try to form a word with R in position 1 and A in position 4? \n\n Example: ""R _ _ A ?"" \n\n We need to fill positions 2,3,5? \n\n We can use common letters: S, L, O, etc.\n\n How about ""RULER""? But we have U, L, E? But E is eliminated? So not allowed.\n\n How about ""RIFLE""? But E is eliminated? \n\n How about ""RUMBA""? \n   R (1), U (2), M (3), B (4), A (5) -> but then A is in position 5? And we are not using position 4? Actually, we have A in position 5? \n   But we also have B in position 4? \n\n However, we are testing U, M, B? \n\n But note: we have A in position 5? Which is allowed? \n\n Alternatively, we can try ""RUMBA"" but then we are putting A in position 5? \n\n But we also have to avoid the eliminated letters? U, M, B are not eliminated? \n\n However, we have two letters to test? \n\n But let me think: we have two confirmed letters: A and R? And we are introducing U, M, B? \n\n But we have to consider: we know that the secret word has A and R? And we are placing R at 1 and A at 5? \n\n But we don\'t know if that\'s correct? \n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and R in the last two positions? Like ""SOLAR"" as I thought earlier? \n\n Let me check: ""SOLAR"" -> S,O,L,A,R? \n   S: not tested? \n   O: not tested?\n   L: not tested?\n   A: in position 4? \n   R: in position 5? \n\n This seems good? \n\n But we have to avoid the eliminated letters? Yes, S,O,L are not eliminated? \n\n So I think ""SOLAR"" is a good candidate? \n\n However, note: we have already tried R in position 3 in ""party"" and it was wrong? But in ""SOLAR"", R is in position 5? Which is new? \n\n Similarly, A was in position 4? Which we haven\'t tried? \n\n Also, we are testing three new letters: S, O, L? \n\n But what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don\'t know? But we haven\'t seen any duplicates so far? \n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more common letters? \n\n Another idea: ""SAVOR"": \n   S (1), A (2) -> but A in position 2? We know A cannot be in position 2? Because from ""party"", A was in position 2 and it was wrong? So that\'s invalid.\n\n How about ""AROMA""? \n   A (1), R (2) -> but R in position 2? We know R cannot be in position 2? Because from ""crane"", R was in position 2 and wrong? So invalid.\n\n How about ""AUDIO""? \n   A (1), U (2), D (3), I (4), O (5) -> but we don\'t have R? We must include R? Because we know R is in the word? So we cannot skip R? \n\n Therefore, we must include both A and R? \n\n So ""SOLAR"" seems a good choice? \n\n But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters? \n\n How about ""SHARD""? \n   S (1), H (2), A (3) -> but A in position 3? We know A cannot be in position 3? So invalid.\n\n How about ""FRAUD""? \n   F (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? \n\n How about ""BRAWL""? \n   B (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? \n\n How about ""CRAWL""? But C is eliminated? \n\n How about ""DRAWL""? \n   D (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? \n\n How about ""GRASP""? \n   G (1), R (2) -> R in position 2? Not allowed? \n\n How about ""RASPY""? \n   R (1), A (2) -> but A in position 2? Not allowed? \n\n So it\'s tricky? \n\n Let me try to put A in position 1? \n\n Example: ""A _ _ R _"" \n\n How about ""ALARM""? \n   A (1), L (2), A (3) -> but we have A in position 3? We know A cannot be in position 3? So invalid? \n\n How about ""AUDIO"" without R? Not allowed? \n\n How about ""AORTA""? \n   A (1), O (2), R (3) -> but R in position 3? We know R cannot be in position 3? Because from ""party"", R was in position 3 and wrong? So invalid.\n\n How about ""AISLE""? But E is eliminated? \n\n How about ""ALIKE""? But E and K? We haven\'t eliminated K? But E is eliminated? \n\n How about ""ALIBI""? \n   A (1), L (2), I (3), B (4), I (5) -> but we don\'t have R? \n\n We must include R? \n\n How about ""AEGIS""? But E is eliminated? \n\n So I think the best option is to put A and R in the last two positions? \n\n Therefore, I choose ""SOLAR"". \n\n But note: we have to make sure we are not repeating the same mistake? \n\n In ""SOLAR"":\n   Position 1: S -> new\n   Position 2: O -> new\n   Position 3: L -> new\n   Position 4: A -> we are testing A in position 4? \n   Position 5: R -> we are testing R in position 5? \n\n We know A cannot be in 2 or 3? So 4 is okay? \n We know R cannot be in 2 or 3? So 5 is okay? \n\n And we are testing three new letters? \n\n So let\'s go with ""SOLAR"". \n\n But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don\'t know? But we haven\'t seen any? \n\n Alternatively, we can try ""LABOR"": \n   L (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? \n\n How about ""ROBIN"": but N is eliminated? \n\n How about ""ROGUE"": but E is eliminated? \n\n How about ""RADIO"": \n   R (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? \n\n How about ""RABID"": \n   R (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? \n\n How about ""RACER"": but C and E are eliminated? \n\n So I think ""SOLAR"" is a good choice? \n\n But let me check if there is a word that uses more common letters? \n\n Another idea: ""SAUCE""? But C and E are eliminated? \n\n How about ""SALAD""? \n   S (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? \n\n How about ""SALSA""? \n   S (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? \n\n How about ""SALON""? N eliminated? \n\n How about ""SALVO"": \n   S (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? \n\n How about ""SABER"": E eliminated? \n\n How about ""SABRA"": \n   S (1), A (2) -> A in position 2? Not allowed? \n\n So I think we have to avoid position 2 for A? \n\n Therefore, I will go with ""SOLAR"". \n\n Guess: ""SOLAR""\n\n Format: <guess>solar</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Eliminated Letters**: C, N, E, P, T, Y (not in the word at all).\n- **Confirmed Letters**: A and R are in the word, but their positions are incorrect in both prior guesses:\n  - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from ""party"" and ""crane"" feedback).\n  - R cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from ""crane"" and ""party"" feedback).\n- **Remaining Possibilities**: A must be in position 1, 4, or 5; R must be in position 1, 4, or 5. The word has 3 additional unknown letters.\n\nFor this guess, I chose **""solar""** because:\n- It places A in position 4 and R in position 5—both untested positions that fit the constraints.\n- It tests 3 new common letters (S, O, L) to gather more information.\n- It avoids all eliminated letters and adheres to positional rules.\n\n<guess>solar</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) R(-) T(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: solar -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(-) L(-) A(-) R(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the third guess ""solar"":\n S(x) : S is not in the secret word.\n O(-) : O is in the secret word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2).\n L(-) : L is in the secret word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).\n A(-) : A is in the secret word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4).\n R(-) : R is in the secret word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5).\n\n Now, combining with previous feedback:\n\n Eliminated letters: C, N, E, P, T, Y, S (from this guess). So total eliminated: C, E, N, P, T, Y, S.\n\n Confirmed letters in the word: A, R (from before), and now also O and L are confirmed to be in the word.\n\n So the secret word contains: A, R, O, L. And one more letter? Because it\'s 5 letters? We have 4 confirmed: A, R, O, L. So there is one more letter to find.\n\n But note: the feedback for ""solar"" shows that all five letters in the guess are either not in the word (S) or in the word but wrong position (O, L, A, R). Since S is not in the word, we have O, L, A, R in the word? But we already knew A and R? Now we know O and L are also in the word? \n\n However, wait: the word has 5 letters. We have 4 letters: A, R, O, L. So the fifth letter is missing? \n\n But the feedback says that O, L, A, R are in the word? So the secret word must have at least these four? And one more? \n\n But it could have duplicates? However, we have no indication of duplicates so far? \n\n Alternatively, the secret word might have exactly these four and one duplicate? But we don\'t know.\n\n But let\'s assume for now that there are no duplicates? Then the secret word has 5 distinct letters: A, R, O, L, and one more.\n\n We also have positional constraints:\n\n From previous guesses:\n\n For A:\n   - Not in position 2 (from ""party"" guess: A in position 2 was wrong)\n   - Not in position 3 (from ""crane"" guess: A in position 3 was wrong)\n   - Not in position 4 (from ""solar"" guess: A in position 4 was wrong)\n\n Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 5? (since positions 2,3,4 are ruled out)\n\n For R:\n   - Not in position 2 (from ""crane"")\n   - Not in position 3 (from ""party"")\n   - Not in position 5 (from ""solar"": R in position 5 was wrong)\n\n Therefore, R must be in position 1 or 4? (positions 2,3,5 are ruled out)\n\n For O:\n   - From ""solar"": O was in position 2 and it was wrong? So O is not in position 2.\n\n For L:\n   - From ""solar"": L was in position 3 and it was wrong? So L is not in position 3.\n\n Now, we also know that the secret word has one more letter? Let\'s call it X? We don\'t know X.\n\n We need to form a 5-letter word with letters: A, R, O, L, X? Where X is a letter not eliminated? \n\n Eliminated letters: C, E, N, P, T, Y, S.\n\n Available letters: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Z? But note: O is already in the word? So we are looking for one more letter? \n\n But wait: the word must have 5 distinct letters? We don\'t know? But we haven\'t encountered duplicates? So let\'s assume distinct.\n\n Now, we have to assign positions:\n\n Positions: 1,2,3,4,5\n\n Constraints:\n   A: position 1 or 5\n   R: position 1 or 4\n   O: not position 2\n   L: not position 3\n\n Also, note: if R is in position 1, then A cannot be in position 1? So if R is in 1, then A must be in 5? \n   Similarly, if R is in 4, then A can be in 1 or 5? \n\n But also, we have to place O and L and X.\n\n Let me consider the two cases for R:\n\n Case 1: R in position 1.\n   Then A must be in position 5 (since A cannot be in 1 if R is there? And the only other option for A is 5).\n   Then we have positions 2,3,4 to fill with O, L, and X.\n\n   Constraints for O: not in 2? But we can put O in 3 or 4? \n   Constraints for L: not in 3? So L can be in 2 or 4? \n\n   But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters? \n\n   Also, we have to form a valid word.\n\n   Example: R _ _ _ A\n\n   We need to fill positions 2,3,4 with O, L, and X? \n\n   How about: R O L _ A? But then L is in position 3? But L cannot be in position 3? So that\'s invalid.\n\n   How about: R O _ L A? Then O in position 2? But O cannot be in position 2? So that\'s invalid.\n\n   How about: R L _ O A? \n        Position 2: L -> allowed? (L can be in 2? because we only know it cannot be in 3)\n        Position 3: ? \n        Position 4: O -> allowed? (O can be in 4? because we only know it cannot be in 2)\n\n   So we have R, L, ?, O, A.\n\n   The word must be valid? What words are there? \n\n   Example: ""RULOA""? Not a word.\n\n   How about ""RADIO""? But we have A and D? But D is not in the word? And we have O? But we have R in 1, A in 5? But in ""RADIO"", A is in 2? Not 5? \n\n   We need a word that ends with A? \n\n   Example: ""ROTLA""? Not a word.\n\n   How about ""ROULA""? Not a word.\n\n   How about ""RHYLA""? Not a word.\n\n   This seems difficult? \n\n Case 2: R in position 4.\n   Then A can be in position 1 or 5.\n\n   Subcase 2a: A in position 1.\n        Word: A _ _ R ?\n\n        The last position must be the fifth letter? But we have O, L, and X to place? \n\n        Positions: \n          1: A\n          2: ? \n          3: ?\n          4: R\n          5: ?\n\n        We have to place O, L, and X in positions 2,3,5? \n\n        Constraints: \n          O: not in 2? So O can be in 3 or 5?\n          L: not in 3? So L can be in 2 or 5?\n\n        Example: A L O R ? -> but then we have to put X in position 5? But we have only one spot? And we have two letters? Wait, no: we have three letters to place? But we have three positions? \n\n        Actually, we have to assign O, L, and X to positions 2,3,5? \n\n        How about: \n          Position 2: L? -> allowed? \n          Position 3: O? -> allowed? (O can be in 3? because we only know it cannot be in 2)\n          Position 5: X? \n\n        But then we have a word: A L O R X? \n\n        But we need a valid word? \n\n        Example: ""ALOR X"" -> not a word? \n\n        How about: \n          Position 2: X (the unknown)\n          Position 3: L? -> but L cannot be in 3? So invalid.\n\n        How about:\n          Position 2: X\n          Position 3: O? -> allowed? \n          Position 5: L? -> allowed? \n\n        Then word: A X O R L? \n\n        Example: ""AXORL"" not a word.\n\n        How about:\n          Position 2: O? -> but O cannot be in 2? So invalid.\n\n        How about:\n          Position 2: L? -> allowed? \n          Position 3: X? \n          Position 5: O? -> allowed? \n\n        Word: A L X R O? \n\n        Example: ""ALXRO"" not a word.\n\n        How about:\n          Position 2: X\n          Position 3: ? -> we have to put either O or L? But O can be in 3? and L cannot be in 3? So we put O in 3? \n          Position 5: L? \n\n        Word: A X O R L? -> not a word.\n\n   Subcase 2b: A in position 5.\n        Word: ? _ _ R A\n\n        We have to fill positions 1,2,3 with O, L, and X? \n\n        Constraints:\n          O: not in 2? So O can be in 1 or 3?\n          L: not in 3? So L can be in 1 or 2?\n\n        Example: \n          Position 1: O? -> allowed? \n          Position 2: L? -> allowed? (L can be in 2? because we only know it cannot be in 3)\n          Position 3: X? \n          Then word: O L X R A? \n\n        Example: ""OLXRA"" not a word.\n\n        How about:\n          Position 1: L? \n          Position 2: O? -> but O cannot be in 2? So invalid.\n\n        How about:\n          Position 1: O? \n          Position 2: X? \n          Position 3: L? -> but L cannot be in 3? So invalid.\n\n        How about:\n          Position 1: X? \n          Position 2: O? -> invalid (O cannot be in 2)\n          Position 3: L? -> invalid (L cannot be in 3)\n\n        How about:\n          Position 1: L? \n          Position 2: X? \n          Position 3: O? -> allowed? (O can be in 3? because we only know it cannot be in 2)\n\n        Then word: L X O R A? \n\n        Example: ""LXORA"" not a word.\n\n        How about:\n          Position 1: O? \n          Position 2: L? -> allowed? \n          Position 3: X? \n          Then word: O L X R A? \n\n        Example: ""OLXRA"" not a word.\n\n This is getting difficult? Maybe we need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? \n\n Alternatively, we might have missed that the secret word has only 4 distinct letters? For example, one letter repeated? \n\n Let me reexamine the feedback.\n\n In the third guess ""solar"", we had:\n   S (x) -> not in word\n   O (-) -> in word, wrong position\n   L (-) -> in word, wrong position\n   A (-) -> in word, wrong position\n   R (-) -> in word, wrong position\n\n This means that the secret word contains O, L, A, R? But it might have a duplicate of one of these? Or it might have a fifth letter that is one of these? \n\n But note: we have five positions? And we have four letters? So there must be a duplicate? \n\n Therefore, the secret word has at least one duplicate letter? \n\n Which letter is duplicated? It could be A, R, O, or L? \n\n Now, let\'s think about the first guess ""crane"": \n   C (x), R (-), A (-), N (x), E (x)\n\n And second guess ""party"":\n   P (x), A (-), R (-), T (x), Y (x)\n\n In ""crane"", we had R and A? And in ""party"", we had A and R? And in ""solar"", we had O, L, A, R? \n\n If there is a duplicate, then one of these letters appears twice? \n\n How can we find out which one? \n\n We can try to consider the positions again? \n\n But we have constraints on positions? \n\n Let me list the positions we know are invalid for each letter:\n\n A: cannot be in 2,3,4 (from positions in ""party"", ""crane"", ""solar"")\n    So A must be in 1 or 5.\n\n R: cannot be in 2,3,5 (from ""crane"", ""party"", ""solar"")\n    So R must be in 1 or 4.\n\n O: cannot be in 2 (from ""solar"")\n    So O can be in 1,3,4,5.\n\n L: cannot be in 3 (from ""solar"")\n    So L can be in 1,2,4,5.\n\n Now, if there is a duplicate, then one of these letters appears twice? \n\n We have to form a word that has five letters from {A, R, O, L} with one duplicate? \n\n The word must have exactly five letters? So one letter appears twice? \n\n Let me try to assign positions:\n\n We have two cases for R: position 1 or 4.\n\n Case 1: R in position 1.\n   Then A must be in position 5? (because A cannot be in 1 if R is there? and A can only be in 1 or 5? so 5)\n   Then we have positions 2,3,4 to fill? \n\n   We have to use two of {O, L} and one duplicate of either A, R, O, or L? \n\n   But R is already used? And A is at the end? \n\n   So the duplicate could be R? But R is at position 1? Then we need another R? \n   Or duplicate of A? But A is at position 5? Then we need another A? \n   Or duplicate of O or L? \n\n   Let me try duplicate of O? Then we have two O\'s and one L? \n\n   Positions 2,3,4: we need to assign two O\'s and one L? \n\n   But constraints:\n        O: not in 2? So O cannot be in position 2? \n        L: not in 3? \n\n   So if we put L in position 2? Then we can put O in 3 and 4? \n        Word: R (1), L (2), O (3), O (4), A (5) -> ""RLOOA""? Not a word.\n\n   If we put L in position 4? Then we put O in 2? But O cannot be in 2? So invalid.\n\n   If we put L in position 3? But L cannot be in 3? \n\n   So duplicate of O doesn\'t work.\n\n   Duplicate of L? Then we have two L\'s and one O? \n        Positions 2,3,4: two L\'s and one O? \n        But L cannot be in 3? So we cannot put L in position 3? \n        So we must put L in positions 2 and 4? \n        Then O in position 3? \n        Word: R (1), L (2), O (3), L (4), A (5) -> ""RLOLA""? Not a word.\n\n   Duplicate of A? Then we have two A\'s? But A is already in position 5? So we need another A in positions 2,3, or 4? \n        But A cannot be in 2,3,4? Because we have feedback that A is not in 2,3,4? \n        So impossible.\n\n   Duplicate of R? Then we have two R\'s? One at position 1, and another in positions 2,3,4? \n        But R cannot be in 2 or 3? So it must be in position 4? \n        Then we have R at 1 and 4? \n        Then positions 2 and 3: we have to put O and L? \n        Constraints: \n            O: not in 2? So O must be in 3? \n            L: not in 3? So L must be in 2? \n        Word: R (1), L (2), O (3), R (4), A (5) -> ""RLORA""? Not a word.\n\n Case 2: R in position 4.\n   Then A can be in 1 or 5.\n\n   Subcase 2a: A in position 1.\n        Word: A _ _ R ?\n        Positions 2,3,5 to fill? (since position 4 is R)\n\n        We have to use two of {O, L} and one duplicate? \n\n        The duplicate could be A, R, O, L.\n\n        But A is at 1? So if duplicate of A, then we need another A? But A cannot be in 2,3,4? and 5 is available? But we have position 5 available? \n            So we could put A in position 5? But then we have two A\'s? \n            Then positions 2 and 3: we put O and L? \n            Constraints:\n                O: not in 2? -> so O in 3? \n                L: not in 3? -> so L in 2? \n            Word: A (1), L (2), O (3), R (4), A (5) -> ""ALORA""? Is that a word? ""Alora"" is a proper name? But we need a common word? \n\n        Let me check: ""alora"" is not in the standard word list? \n\n        Duplicate of R? But R is at 4? Then we need another R? \n            We can put R in position 2,3, or 5? \n            But R cannot be in 2 or 3? (from feedback) and also not in 5? (from ""solar"" feedback: R in 5 was wrong) -> so R cannot be in 2,3,5? and 4 is already used? So duplicate of R would require a third R? Not possible.\n\n        Duplicate of O?

S and P eliminated? \n\n I am considering that the secret word might be ""oral"" something? \n\n Another idea: the word ""LORDS""? but S eliminated? \n\n Perhaps we missed a possibility: in the first guess, we had ""crane"", and R was in position 2 and it was wrong position, but that doesn\'t mean R is not in position 2 for other occurrences? But no, because the feedback is per letter, not per occurrence. In Wordle, if there is a duplicate, the feedback might be complex? \n\n But in our feedback, for ""solar"", we have R in position 5 and it was marked wrong position, which means that either there is another R that is not in position 5, or if there is only one R, then it\'s not in 5. \n\n Given the difficulty, let\'s try to guess a word that tests the possibility of A in position 1 and R in position 4, with common letters in the other positions? \n\n We know the word has O and L as well? \n\n So let\'s try ""ALERT""? but E and T are eliminated? \n\n How about ""ADORE""? E eliminated? \n\n How about ""ABHOR""? \n   A, B, H, O, R -> distinct? \n   Positions: \n        A in 1? -> allowed? \n        B in 2? \n        H in 3? \n        O in 4? -> but we have R in position 5? \n        R in 5? -> but R cannot be in 5? \n\n In ""ABHOR"", R is in position 5? which is not allowed? \n\n How about ""ABHOR"" with R in position 4?

(L can be in 2) \n   Position 3: ? (new letter, say D) \n   Position 4: R \n   Position 5: A \n   Word: O L D R A -> ""OLDRA"" not a word.\n\n   Position 1: L? \n   Position 2: O? -> not allowed (O cannot be in 2) \n   invalid.\n\n   Position 1: D? \n   Position 2: O? -> not allowed \n   invalid.\n\n   Position 1: O? \n   Position 2: D? \n   Position 3: L? -> not allowed (L cannot be in 3) \n   invalid.\n\n   Position 1: L? \n   Position 2: D? \n   Position 3: O? -> allowed? \n   Position 4: R \n   Position 5: A \n   Word: L D O R A -> ""LDORA"" not a word.\n\n   Position 1: D? \n   Position 2: L? -> allowed? \n   Position 3: O? -> allowed? \n   Word: D L O R A -> ""DLORA"" not a word.\n\n So not working. \n\n Perhaps the word is ""LARVA""? but A in position 2 is not allowed. \n\n Let me try to ignore the distinct letters assumption. \n\n We know the word has at least A, R, O, L. And one of them is repeated. \n\n We have feedback from ""solar"": \n   O in position 2: wrong position -> so there is an O not in position 2? \n   L in position 3: wrong position -> so there is an L not in position 3? \n   A in position 4: wrong position -> so there is an A not in position 4? \n   R in position 5: wrong position -> so there is an R not in position 5? \n\n If there is a duplicate, then the feedback might be for one of the occurrences. \n\n For example, if the word has two A\'s, then one A might be in a correct position and the other in wrong? But the feedback for ""solar"" has A in position 4 and it\'s marked wrong, so at least the A in position 4 is not correct. If there is another A, it might be in a correct position? \n\n But in our earlier constraints, we have that A cannot be in 2,3,4? so the only possibility for a correct A is position 1 or 5. \n\n Similarly for R: cannot be in 2,3,5? so only position 1 or 4. \n\n Let\'s try to assume that the word has two A\'s. Then one A must be in 1 or 5, and the other A must be in the other of 1 or 5, or in a position that is not 2,3,4? but there are only positions 1 and 5 available for A? so both A\'s must be in 1 and 5? \n\n Then the word starts and ends with A? \n\n So the word is A _ _ _ A \n\n And we know R is in the word, and must be in position 4? (because R can only be in 1 or 4, but position 1 is A, so R in 4) \n\n Then the word is A _ _ R A \n\n Now, we have to fill positions 2 and 3 with O and L? because we know O and L are in the word? \n\n But we have only two positions? and two letters? \n\n Constraints: \n   O: not in 2? \n   L: not in 3? \n\n So we can put:\n   Option 1: O in 3, L in 2? \n        Word: A L O R A -> ""ALORA"" \n\n   Option 2: L in 2, O in 3? -> same as above.\n\n   Option 3: We might have duplicates of O or L? but we have only two positions? \n\n So the only possibility is ""ALORA"". \n\n Is ""ALORA"" a word? \n\n Upon checking, ""Alora"" is a proper name, but in the context of Wordle, it might be accepted? Or maybe not. \n\n Alternatively, in some word lists, it might be included. \n\n Given the constraints, I think we should try ""ALORA"". \n\n So I will guess ""ALORA"". \n\n But note: we have not used any new letters? We are only using A, L, O, R. \n\n And we are assuming two A\'s. \n\n If it\'s not a word, then we may have to try something else. \n\n But let\'s try. \n\n Guess: ""ALORA""\n\n Format: <guess>alora</guess>After analyzing the feedback from all guesses:\n\n- **Eliminated Letters**: C, E, N, P, T, Y, S (not in the word).\n- **Confirmed Letters**: A, R, O, L (all are in the word but misplaced in prior guesses).\n- **Positional Constraints**:\n  - A: Cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (must be in 1 or 5).\n  - R: Cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (must be in 1 or 4).\n  - O: Cannot be in position 2.\n  - L: Cannot be in position 3.\n- **Key Insight**: The word must contain at least one duplicate letter (since only 4 unique letters are confirmed for a 5-letter word). Given positional constraints, the only feasible solution is a duplicate ""A"" (since A must occupy positions 1 and 5 to satisfy all constraints), with R in position 4, and O and L in positions 2 and 3.\n\nThe word **""ALORA""** fits all criteria:\n- A in position 1 (allowed) and 5 (allowed).\n- R in position 4 (allowed).\n- L in position 2 (allowed, as L can be in 2).\n- O in position 3 (allowed, as O can be in 3).\n- Satisfies feedback: A, L, O, R are in the word but not in positions tested in prior guesses.\n\n<guess>alora</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) R(-) T(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: solar -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(-) L(-) A(-) R(-)\nGuess 4: alora -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(✓) O(✓) R(✓) A(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from the fourth guess ""alora"":
 A(-), L(✓), O(✓), R(✓), A(✓)

 Interpretation:
  - The first A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
  - L is in the correct position (position 2).
  - O is in the correct position (position 3).
  - R is in the correct position (position 4).
  - The second A is in the correct position (position 5).

 Therefore, we know that positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 are: L, O, R, A respectively.

 The secret word has:

   Position 1: ? 
   Position 2: L
   Position 3: O
   Position 4: R
   Position 5: A

 So the word is _ L O R A.

 We also know that the first A (in guess ""alora"" at position 1) is marked as in the word but wrong position. 
 However, we already have an A at position 5. This means that there must be another A in the word? Or the same A? Since the feedback for the first A is (-), it means that there is at least one A that is not in position 1, and since we have A at position 5, it could be that the secret word has only one A? But then why is the first A marked with (-)? In Wordle, if there is only one A and it is at position 5, then the A at position 1 would be marked as (x) because it is not in the word at all? But no: (x) means the letter is not in the word at all, while (-) means it is in the word but not in that position.

 So if the secret word has only one A (at position 5), then the A at position 1 in the guess should be marked as (x) because it's not in the secret word. But it's marked as (-), which means that there is an A in the secret word that is not in position 1? Since we have the A at position 5, it could be that there is an additional A in the secret word? 

 Therefore, the secret word must have at least two A's: one at position 5, and another elsewhere? Because if there were only one A (at position 5), then the A in position 1 would get an (x), not a (-).

 But we have four positions filled: _ L O R A.

 And we know from previous feedback that the secret word contains at least two A's.

 The only open position is position 1. But if position 1 is A, then we would have A at positions 1 and 5. However, in the feedback for ""alora"", the first A was marked as (-) which is wrong position. That means that position 1 is not A? But if we put A at position 1, then it should be (✓) if correct? But it's marked as (-), meaning not correct.

 Therefore, position 1 is not A. So there must be an A in a different position? But positions 2,3,4 are fixed to L,O,R? And position 5 is A. So where is the extra A? 

 This is a contradiction for a 5-letter word.

 Unless the secret word has three A's? For example, one at position 1? But that would be marked as (✓) if correct? But it's marked as (-).

 Let me reexamine: 

 In ""alora"", the first letter is A, which we thought was at position 1, and it's marked (-). The last letter is A at position 5, marked (✓).

 The feedback: 
   Guess: A L O R A
   Secret: ? L O R A   (because L,O,R,A in positions 2,3,4,5 are correct)

 Now, if the secret word has a letter at position 1 that is not A, but there is another A elsewhere? But the positions 2,3,4 are L,O,R, and position 5 is A, so there's no room for an extra A. 

 The only possibility is that the secret word has only one A, and it is in position 5. Then the A in position 1 in the guess should be marked as (x) because it's not in the secret word? But it was marked as (-). 

 Why would it be (-)? 

 This suggests that the secret word does have an A in a position other than 1? But the other positions are fixed? 

 Let me think about the rules of Wordle. If a letter appears k times in the secret word, then:

   - If in the guess you have that letter in a position that matches, it gets ✓ and counts as one occurrence.
   - The remaining (if any) non-matching occurrences of that letter in the guess can get (-) only if there are unmatched occurrences in the secret word.

 In this case, in ""alora"", the fifth letter A is matched (✓). That means one occurrence of A is accounted for.

 The first letter A is then not matched. If the secret word has only one A, then the first A would get (x) because there are no more A's available. But it got (-), which means that there must be at least one more A in the secret word that is not matched? 

 Therefore, the secret word must have at least two A's. And one of them is in position 5. The other A must be in one of the positions 1,2,3,4? But positions 2,3,4 are L,O,R? and position 5 is A. So the only possibility is position 1? But the feedback says that the A in position 1 is wrong, which would happen only if the extra A is not in position 1? 

 How can this happen? 

 The secret word has the letter in position 1 being different from A? But then the extra A must be in positions 2, 3, or 4? But positions 2,3,4 are L,O,R? So none of them is A.

 The secret word is: [letter1] L O R A.

 And we know that this secret word has two A's? But only one A is evident (at position 5). So letter1 must be A? But then position 1 would be A, and then in the guess ""alora"", the first A would be correct? 

 So let me check: 
   If the secret word is ""ALORA"", then:

   Guess: A L O R A -> 
        Position 1: A in secret is A (so ✓), 
        Position 2: L matches (✓),
        Position 3: O matches (✓),
        Position 4: R matches (✓),
        Position 5: A matches (✓).

   But the feedback we got for guess 4 was: A(-) L(✓) O(✓) R(✓) A(✓)

   That is, the first A is (-) instead of (✓). 

   This means the secret word is not ""ALORA"".

 So what is the issue? 

 Perhaps there is a duplicate letter not counted at position 1? 

 Another possibility: the secret word is like ""LAROA"" or another arrangement that disagrees with the positions 2,3,4,5 being L,O,R,A? But the feedback for guess 4 has L,O,R,A in positions 2,3,4 as correct? So they must be fixed.

 Therefore, the secret word must be _ L O R A, and the blank is not A.

 Then why did the first A in the guess get (-)? 

 This can only happen if the secret word has an A in a position that is not position 1, and that hasn't been revealed yet? But we have revealed positions 2,3,4,5 -> L,O,R,A. None of which (aside from 5) is A.

 The only possibility is that the secret word has two A's? But we only see one? Or three? 

 How about if the secret word is ""ALORA"", but then why would the first A be marked as (-) when it is (✓)? 

 I think there might be a mistake in our assumptions. One possibility is that we have a duplicate letter in positions 1 and 5? But we know that the A at position 5 is correct. If the secret word has position 1 as A, then it should be marked correct? But it's not.

 Let me reread the feedback: 
   ""Guess 4: alora -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(✓) O(✓) R(✓) A(✓)""

 This feedback suggests that:
   - The fifth A is correct (✓).
   - The first A is in the word but not in position 1? This implies that there is at least one more A in the secret word in a position other than position 1 and not position 5 (because position 5 is attributed to the last A).

 But in the secret word, position 5 is A. So the extra A would have to be in position 2,3, or 4? But position 2 is L, position 3 is O, position 4 is R? and position 5 is A? So none of positions 2,3,4 can be A. 

 Contradiction.

 Another possibility is that the secret word is ""A"" duplicated but in a pattern that we haven't nailed down? 

 Or perhaps the feedback for ""alora"" has been misinterpreted? 

 The guess ""alora"":
   Position 1: A -> (-)
   Position 2: L -> (✓)
   Position 3: O -> (✓)
   position 4: R -> (✓)
   position 5: A -> (✓)

 Since the secret word has position 2,3,4,5 as L,O,R,A respectively? and a letter at position 1 that is not L,O,R,A? 

 Then why is the first A marked as (-) and not (x)? This can happen if the secret word has an additional A elsewhere? But there are no additional positions? 

 Unless the secret word has three A's? But then in the feedback, the first A being (s) (wrong position) would be correct because there is an unmatched A in the secret word? But we have only one A in the guess at position 1 that is unmatched? But we also matched position 5? 

 So with two A's in the guess and only one matching position 5, why is the first A not marked as (x) unless there is a second A in the secret word somewhere else? 

 But in the secret word, if the format is ? L O R A; and we have L,O,R at positions 2,3,4; and A at position 5; then the only letter left is at position 1.

 If the secret word's position 1 is A, then it would be a match? 
 If not, then if position 1 is not A, then the secret word has only one A (at position 5)? so the first A in the guess should be (x)? 

 This suggests that the secret word has more than one A? 

 Given the only available position is position 1, it must be A? but then it would be a match? 

 This is a paradox.

 The only resolution is that the secret word has a letter duplicated in the remaining positions? 

 But position 1 is the only position available.

 Perhaps the secret word is ""ALORA"", but then the first A should be (✓)? 

 The only other possibility is that secret word is not of the form ?LORA? But the feedback says position 2,3,4,5 are L,O,R,A? 

 How about the secret word has five a's? But that doesn't fix the positions.

 Given the feedback, it might be a technical error? But let's think of actual words that fit ?LORA.

 The only common word I know ending with ""LORA"" is ""GLORA"" (not a word) or ""ФLORA"" (not English).

 But there is ""FLORA"", which is a word.

 But let's check the feedback.

 If the secret word is ""FLORA"", then:

   Position 1: F
   Position 2: L
   position 3: O
   position 4: R
   position 5: A

 Then for guess ""alora"":

   Position 1: A -> not in secret? So it should be (x), but we have ( (-) ) -> how?

 Let me simulate:

   secret: F L O R A
   guess: A L O R A

   Feedback for:
     A: not in secret? But but we have one A in position 5? The A at position 1 is not in the secret word since there's only one A? So it should be (x) or (-)? 

   Since there's only one A in the secret and one in the guess at position 5 is match, the A at position 1 is extra and not in the secret? So it should be (x).

   But in the feedback, it is (-).

   This doesn't match.

  If the secret word has an extra A? like ""ALORA"", then it should have been all (✓) for the guess, which it wasn't.

  Another possibility: the secret word is ""LORA_A"", with a duplicate A elsewhere? but positions are fixed to 5 letters.

  Given the perplexity, perhaps we should assume that the secret word is ""FLORA"" and the feedback for the first A was (x) but reported as (-)? But that is not likely.

  Or perhaps we have a mistake in reasoning.

  Let me double-check the feedback history.

  We have for guess 4: ""alora"" -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(✓) O(✓) R(✓) A(✓)

  In standard Wordle rules, for a guess ""ALORA"" and a secret ""FLORA"":

   - The first letter 'A': not in the secret -> should be (x) because secret's only A is at position 5, and is already matched by the fifth letter.
   - Thus, the feedback should be: A(x) L(✓) O(✓) R(✓) A(✓)?   wait, no: because the fifth A is correctly placed, and the first A is not present.

  In fact, in Wordle, for the letter A in the guess ""ALORA"":
   - The fifth A is matched with the secret's fifth A. So it gets (✓).
   - Does the first A get compared? Since there's only one A in the secret, and it's already matched, the first A should be (x).

  But the feedback says the first A is (-).

  This would only happen if there were a second A in the secret word? So the secret must contain two A's. One is at position 5. The other must be at position 1? to be the only available position? But then it would be (✓) for the guess's first letter, not (-).

  This is a contradiction.

  The only way to resolve it is if the secret word has an additional A in a position that is not position 2,3,4,5? but thbar positions 2,3,4 are L,O,R? and position 5 is A.

  For example, if the secret word was ""LOARA"", meaning:
     L in position 1
     O in position 2
     A in position 3
     R in position 4
     A in position 5

  Then for guess ""alora"":

   position 1: A (guess) vs. L (secret) -> not match, but the letter A is in the secret (at position 3 and 5) -> so since there are two A's in secret, and one is matched at position 5 (✓), the other at position 3 is unmatched? and the guess has this A at position 1, so it should be (-).

   position 2: L (guess) and O (secret) -> mismatch
   would be: guess L at position 2 and secret O -> so L in secret happens at position 1 but is unmatched by other letters?

  Let me do it properly:

   secret: L O A R A
   positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:A, 4:R, 5:A

   guess:  A L O R A

   Feedback per position:

   position 1: guess A; secret L -> not A, but is the letter A in the secret? Yes, because there are two A's. However, in this Position, there's aL, which is not A. The

   In Wordle, for each guess letter, they are checked against the secret:

   - But the feedback for the position is given first for correct position, then for correct letter but wrong position, and then for absence.

   For guess letter at position 1: letter A.
      - It is not in position 1 in secret (secret has L).
      - However, there is an A in the secret in position 3 and position 5? The position 5 is matched later.
      But typically, we allocate the green ones first, then the yellows.

   More precisely:

   Step 1: Mark exact matches.
      Position 5: A matches -> green.
      Position 4: R matches -> green.
      Position 3: O in guess vs. A in secret -> letter not match.
      Position 2: L in guess vs. O in secret -> not match.
      Position 1: A in guess vs. L in secret -> not match.

   Step 2: For the remaining guess letters that haven't been matched green, mark yellows if the letter appears in unmatched positions in the secret.

   position 1: A is in the secret? Yes, but unmatched (in position 3). So yellow.
   position 2: L is in the secret? Yes, unmatched (in position 1). So yellow.
   position 3: O is in the secret? Yes, unmatched (in position 2). So yellow.
   position 4: already matched.

   So the feedback would be: 
      A(-), L(-), O(-), R(✓ A(✓)

   But our feedback was: A(-) L(✓) O(✓) R(✓) A(✓)

   So it doesn't match because our feedback has L(✓) and o(✓), and also R(✓) and a(✓)

   In this scenario, for the secret ""LOARA"", the guess ""alora"" would get three yellows and two greens? not four greens and one yellow.

   But our feedback for guess4 has only one yellow and four greens? 

   Specifically, L✓ means that L is in the correct position, and O(✓) etc. which requires that position 2 is L and matched? 

   Therefore, secret must have L at position 2.

   Similarly, secret must be ?L?R? with the only open position 1? and we know position 3 is O from feedback?

   So it must be _ L O R a.

   That is fixed.

   The only way is then that the secret has one extra A, and it must be in position 1. Then if secret is ""ALORA"", the feedback for guess ""ALORA"" should be all green, but it was not.

   Unless the word is ""ALORA"" and the first letter of the guess was not 'A'? But guess was ""alora"", so first is A.

   This is confusing.

   Perhaps the fifth letter was matched and the first letter A exists in the secret in a different position? But not position 1? but given the form, it must be position 1 is the only option.

   Given:
      Position 2: L -> must be L
      Position 3: O -> must be O
      Position 4: R -> must be R
      Position 5: A -> must be A
      Position 1: our guess A was not in position to be green, but has a yellow.

   That means secret has A in a position that is not 1. But the only possibility is that secret has A in one of positions 2,3,4? but that's not possible because positions 2,3,4 are fixed to L, O, R and none is A.

   Conclusion: there is an error in my chat in previous asusmptions.

   Let's question the feedback for guess3 ""solar"".

   Guess3: solar -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(-) L(-) A(-) R(-)

   This told us that O, L, A, R are in the word but not in the positions in ""solar"":
      solar: positions 1:s, 2:o, 3:l, 4:a, 5:r

   So secret contains O, L, A, R, just not in positions 2,3,4,5 or at all for O in 2, L in 3, etc.

   But in guess4 with ""alora"", we got four of the five positions fixed: position 2 לן, 3:O, 4:R, 5:A.

   So the only issue is position 1 and the first A letter.

   Given the feedback for ""alora"": the first letter A is in the word (-) but not at position 1.

   Therefore, the secret word must have he letter A occurring in a position other than position 1 and also other than position 5 (since position 5 is already matched by the fifth A).

   But positions 2,3,4 are fixed to L, O, R. So none of them is A.

   The only possibility is that the secret word does not positionally agree for the middle letters? But that is disproved by the feedback for ""alora"":

      L at position 2 is green, O at 3 is green, R at 4 is green, a at 5 is green.

   This must be.so.

   Therefore, the only explanation is to have an additional A in the word, which can only be if one of the letters L, O, R is also an A? That is, a duplicate letter being both L or O or R as well as A? But that's not possible.

   Unless the secret word has ""A"" in position 1 and also in position 5, making ""ALORA"", but then the first letter should be green.

   But it is not.

   This indicates that either there is a mistake in the feedback provided, or we've misinterpreted.

   Let's try to assume that the secret word is ""FLORA"" and ignore the feedback for the first A being (-) and assume it should be (x).

   Then 
      secret: F L O R A
      and the word is_FLORA?

   letters: F, L, O, R, A.

   Then for guess ""alora"" (position 1: A), since there's only one A in secret (position 5), the first A should be (x). But it was reported as (-) by the user.

   So perhaps the user reported the feedback incorrectly.

   Or maybe in this variant. After all, the rules say: '-' means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.

   So for ""alora"" guessed against ""FLORA"", the first letter A is indeed in the secret but not in position 1? Because the secret does contain ('A') although at position 5? But then when we say it is in the word, it is, so it should be '-' even though there's only one A and it in position 5? But the feedback should give:

   - The fifth A is correct, so (✓) for position 5.
   - The first A: since the secret has an A and it's not in position 1, but the A is used you think in at position 5, so it's already matched. In standard Wordle, we only give '-' if there is an unmatched occurrence of the letter in the secret. So for guess ""alora"" and secret ""FLORA"", we would:
        - Match the fifth A? so occurrence of A at position 5 is used.
        - The first A has no unmatched occurrence left, so it should be (x).

   Therefore, if the secret has only one A, we should have first A as (x).

   This suggests the secret has two A's? With one in position 5 and one in a different position.

   But the only position left is position 1, which must then be the extra A? and guess's first A would then match it? 

   This is maddening.

   Perhaps the secret word is ""A L O R A"" and the first letter is something else? How can it be? 

   Given the feedback for guess4 has position 5 as ( a ) , it must be A.

   So the secret's fifth letter is A.

   The only resolution is that the secret wordHas a duplicate in positions 2,3, or 4? For example, position 4 might be A? But it is R->green.

   Perhaps position 3 is A? But it is O->green.

   There is a flaw.

   We must yield to the Feedback system: 
      The secret word is _ L O R A.
      The guess ""alora"" produced: A(-), L( in), O( in), R( in), A( in at position 5).
      This can't happen if the secret has only the one A at position 5.
      Therefore, the secret must have two A's: one at position 5, and another at some position.

   The . But position 2,3,4 are L,O,R, none of which is A? and position 1 must be a different letter.

   Therefore, the secret word has letter for position 1,2,3,4,5 such that:

        1: ? then at ( that letter might be)
        2: L
        3: O
        4: R
        5: A

   And in addition, the letter 4 although R, secretly might be another A? but it is R.

   Or Perhaps position 4 is R and also an A? Which is impossible.

   So the only possibility is that position 1 is not a third letter, but must be the second A? and then it would match the guess's first A and1 be green? but it's not.

   Thus, we are left of no valid explanation.

   Given the time, we guess a word that fits as FLORA, and assume the first A should have been X.

   So For our next guess, we know the format is ? L O R A.

   With ? not being A. Moreover, we have eliminated C,E,N:P,T,Y,S.

   We know from guess1 and guess2 that the word contains A and R and now O and L, so we are missing one letter.

   Weנים have to choose a letter that hasn't been eliminated.

   Available letters: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Z (we used A,L,O,R) - but wait, O is in the word, so. We are anding for the first letter.

   Common letters for the first Position of words ending with ""LORA"": 

   Examples: ""FLORA"" - F is available (not eliminated).

   so I will guess ""FLORA"" next.
   even though the feedback for ""alora"" then would have to have the first A as (x) for that to work.

   If the secret is ""FLORA"", then for 'alora', the first A should be (x), which is not as given.

   But perhaps the user made a mistake in reporting the feedback.

   So, guess: ""FLORA""

   <guess>flora</guess>

   If it's not, we have two tries left.
</think>
After analyzing the feedback for ""alora"":
- Positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 are confirmed as **L (✓)**, **O (✓)**, **R (✓)**, and **A (✓)** respectively. Thus, the secret word has the structure: `? L O R A`.
- The first letter **A** in ""alora"" received `(-)`, indicating it is in the secret word but not in position 1. However:
  - Position 5 is already `A`, so if the secret has only one `A`, the first `A` in the guess should be `(x)`, not `(-)`. This implies the secret must contain **two** `A`’s: one at position 5, and one elsewhere.
- Given positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed as `L`, `O`, and `R` (all confirmed ✓), the only possible location for the extra `A` is position 1—but this contradicts the `(-)` feedback, as it should be `(✓)` if correct.

### Resolution:
The only way to reconcile this is to infer the secret word uses **two** `A`’s, with one in position 5 and the other in an position that isn't 1. Since positions 2-4 are occupied by `L`, `O`, and `R`, this is impossible for standard word structures. However, given the feedback, the secret word must be ***FLORA***, assuming the feedback for the first `A` in ""alora"" may have been intended as `(x)` instead of `(-)`. This fits:
- **F L O R A**  
- Letter `F` is not eliminated (available).
- `FLORA` is a valid English word.

Thus, the guess is **FLORA**.

<guess>flora</guess>",flora,"We are given feedback from the fourth guess ""alora"":
 A(-), L(✓), O(✓), R(✓), A(✓)

 Interpretation:
  - The first A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
  - L is in the correct position (position 2).
  - O is in the correct position (position 3).
  - R is in the correct position (position 4).
  - The second A is in the correct position (position 5).

 Therefore, we know that positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 are: L, O, R, A respectively.

 The secret word has:

   Position 1: ? 
   Position 2: L
   Position 3: O
   Position 4: R
   Position 5: A

 So the word is _ L O R A.

 We also know that the first A (in guess ""alora"" at position 1) is marked as in the word but wrong position. 
 However, we already have an A at position 5. This means that there must be another A in the word? Or the same A? Since the feedback for the first A is (-), it means that there is at least one A that is not in position 1, and since we have A at position 5, it could be that the secret word has only one A? But then why is the first A marked with (-)? In Wordle, if there is only one A and it is at position 5, then the A at position 1 would be marked as (x) because it is not in the word at all? But no: (x) means the letter is not in the word at all, while (-) means it is in the word but not in that position.

 So if the secret word has only one A (at position 5), then the A at position 1 in the guess should be marked as (x) because it's not in the secret word. But it's marked as (-), which means that there is an A in the secret word that is not in position 1? Since we have the A at position 5, it could be that there is an additional A in the secret word? 

 Therefore, the secret word must have at least two A's: one at position 5, and another elsewhere? Because if there were only one A (at position 5), then the A in position 1 would get an (x), not a (-).

 But we have four positions filled: _ L O R A.

 And we know from previous feedback that the secret word contains at least two A's.

 The only open position is position 1. But if position 1 is A, then we would have A at positions 1 and 5. However, in the feedback for ""alora"", the first A was marked as (-) which is wrong position. That means that position 1 is not A? But if we put A at position 1, then it should be (✓) if correct? But it's marked as (-), meaning not correct.

 Therefore, position 1 is not A. So there must be an A in a different position? But positions 2,3,4 are fixed to L,O,R? And position 5 is A. So where is the extra A? 

 This is a contradiction for a 5-letter word.

 Unless the secret word has three A's? For example, one at position 1? But that would be marked as (✓) if correct? But it's marked as (-).

 Let me reexamine: 

 In ""alora"", the first letter is A, which we thought was at position 1, and it's marked (-). The last letter is A at position 5, marked (✓).

 The feedback: 
   Guess: A L O R A
   Secret: ? L O R A   (because L,O,R,A in positions 2,3,4,5 are correct)

 Now, if the secret word has a letter at position 1 that is not A, but there is another A elsewhere? But the positions 2,3,4 are L,O,R, and position 5 is A, so there's no room for an extra A. 

 The only possibility is that the secret word has only one A, and it is in position 5. Then the A in position 1 in the guess should be marked as (x) because it's not in the secret word? But it was marked as (-). 

 Why would it be (-)? 

 This suggests that the secret word does have an A in a position other than 1? But the other positions are fixed? 

 Let me think about the rules of Wordle. If a letter appears k times in the secret word, then:

   - If in the guess you have that letter in a position that matches, it gets ✓ and counts as one occurrence.
   - The remaining (if any) non-matching occurrences of that letter in the guess can get (-) only if there are unmatched occurrences in the secret word.

 In this case, in ""alora"", the fifth letter A is matched (✓). That means one occurrence of A is accounted for.

 The first letter A is then not matched. If the secret word has only one A, then the first A would get (x) because there are no more A's available. But it got (-), which means that there must be at least one more A in the secret word that is not matched? 

 Therefore, the secret word must have at least two A's. And one of them is in position 5. The other A must be in one of the positions 1,2,3,4? But positions 2,3,4 are L,O,R? and position 5 is A. So the only possibility is position 1? But the feedback says that the A in position 1 is wrong, which would happen only if the extra A is not in position 1? 

 How can this happen? 

 The secret word has the letter in position 1 being different from A? But then the extra A must be in positions 2, 3, or 4? But positions 2,3,4 are L,O,R? So none of them is A.

 The secret word is: [letter1] L O R A.

 And we know that this secret word has two A's? But only one A is evident (at position 5). So letter1 must be A? But then position 1 would be A, and then in the guess ""alora"", the first A would be correct? 

 So let me check: 
   If the secret word is ""ALORA"", then:

   Guess: A L O R A -> 
        Position 1: A in secret is A (so ✓), 
        Position 2: L matches (✓),
        Position 3: O matches (✓),
        Position 4: R matches (✓),
        Position 5: A matches (✓).

   But the feedback we got for guess 4 was: A(-) L(✓) O(✓) R(✓) A(✓)

   That is, the first A is (-) instead of (✓). 

   This means the secret word is not ""ALORA"".

 So what is the issue? 

 Perhaps there is a duplicate letter not counted at position 1? 

 Another possibility: the secret word is like ""LAROA"" or another arrangement that disagrees with the positions 2,3,4,5 being L,O,R,A? But the feedback for guess 4 has L,O,R,A in positions 2,3,4 as correct? So they must be fixed.

 Therefore, the secret word must be _ L O R A, and the blank is not A.

 Then why did the first A in the guess get (-)? 

 This can only happen if the secret word has an A in a position that is not position 1, and that hasn't been revealed yet? But we have revealed positions 2,3,4,5 -> L,O,R,A. None of which (aside from 5) is A.

 The only possibility is that the secret word has two A's? But we only see one? Or three? 

 How about if the secret word is ""ALORA"", but then why would the first A be marked as (-) when it is (✓)? 

 I think there might be a mistake in our assumptions. One possibility is that we have a duplicate letter in positions 1 and 5? But we know that the A at position 5 is correct. If the secret word has position 1 as A, then it should be marked correct? But it's not.

 Let me reread the feedback: 
   ""Guess 4: alora -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(✓) O(✓) R(✓) A(✓)""

 This feedback suggests that:
   - The fifth A is correct (✓).
   - The first A is in the word but not in position 1? This implies that there is at least one more A in the secret word in a position other than position 1 and not position 5 (because position 5 is attributed to the last A).

 But in the secret word, position 5 is A. So the extra A would have to be in position 2,3, or 4? But position 2 is L, position 3 is O, position 4 is R? and position 5 is A? So none of positions 2,3,4 can be A. 

 Contradiction.

 Another possibility is that the secret word is ""A"" duplicated but in a pattern that we haven't nailed down? 

 Or perhaps the feedback for ""alora"" has been misinterpreted? 

 The guess ""alora"":
   Position 1: A -> (-)
   Position 2: L -> (✓)
   Position 3: O -> (✓)
   position 4: R -> (✓)
   position 5: A -> (✓)

 Since the secret word has position 2,3,4,5 as L,O,R,A respectively? and a letter at position 1 that is not L,O,R,A? 

 Then why is the first A marked as (-) and not (x)? This can happen if the secret word has an additional A elsewhere? But there are no additional positions? 

 Unless the secret word has three A's? But then in the feedback, the first A being (s) (wrong position) would be correct because there is an unmatched A in the secret word? But we have only one A in the guess at position 1 that is unmatched? But we also matched position 5? 

 So with two A's in the guess and only one matching position 5, why is the first A not marked as (x) unless there is a second A in the secret word somewhere else? 

 But in the secret word, if the format is ? L O R A; and we have L,O,R at positions 2,3,4; and A at position 5; then the only letter left is at position 1.

 If the secret word's position 1 is A, then it would be a match? 
 If not, then if position 1 is not A, then the secret word has only one A (at position 5)? so the first A in the guess should be (x)? 

 This suggests that the secret word has more than one A? 

 Given the only available position is position 1, it must be A? but then it would be a match? 

 This is a paradox.

 The only resolution is that the secret word has a letter duplicated in the remaining positions? 

 But position 1 is the only position available.

 Perhaps the secret word is ""ALORA"", but then the first A should be (✓)? 

 The only other possibility is that secret word is not of the form ?LORA? But the feedback says position 2,3,4,5 are L,O,R,A? 

 How about the secret word has five a's? But that doesn't fix the positions.

 Given the feedback, it might be a technical error? But let's think of actual words that fit ?LORA.

 The only common word I know ending with ""LORA"" is ""GLORA"" (not a word) or ""ФLORA"" (not English).

 But there is ""FLORA"", which is a word.

 But let's check the feedback.

 If the secret word is ""FLORA"", then:

   Position 1: F
   Position 2: L
   position 3: O
   position 4: R
   position 5: A

 Then for guess ""alora"":

   Position 1: A -> not in secret? So it should be (x), but we have ( (-) ) -> how?

 Let me simulate:

   secret: F L O R A
   guess: A L O R A

   Feedback for:
     A: not in secret? But but we have one A in position 5? The A at position 1 is not in the secret word since there's only one A? So it should be (x) or (-)? 

   Since there's only one A in the secret and one in the guess at position 5 is match, the A at position 1 is extra and not in the secret? So it should be (x).

   But in the feedback, it is (-).

   This doesn't match.

  If the secret word has an extra A? like ""ALORA"", then it should have been all (✓) for the guess, which it wasn't.

  Another possibility: the secret word is ""LORA_A"", with a duplicate A elsewhere? but positions are fixed to 5 letters.

  Given the perplexity, perhaps we should assume that the secret word is ""FLORA"" and the feedback for the first A was (x) but reported as (-)? But that is not likely.

  Or perhaps we have a mistake in reasoning.

  Let me double-check the feedback history.

  We have for guess 4: ""alora"" -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(✓) O(✓) R(✓) A(✓)

  In standard Wordle rules, for a guess ""ALORA"" and a secret ""FLORA"":

   - The first letter 'A': not in the secret -> should be (x) because secret's only A is at position 5, and is already matched by the fifth letter.
   - Thus, the feedback should be: A(x) L(✓) O(✓) R(✓) A(✓)?   wait, no: because the fifth A is correctly placed, and the first A is not present.

  In fact, in Wordle, for the letter A in the guess ""ALORA"":
   - The fifth A is matched with the secret's fifth A. So it gets (✓).
   - Does the first A get compared? Since there's only one A in the secret, and it's already matched, the first A should be (x).

  But the feedback says the first A is (-).

  This would only happen if there were a second A in the secret word? So the secret must contain two A's. One is at position 5. The other must be at position 1? to be the only available position? But then it would be (✓) for the guess's first letter, not (-).

  This is a contradiction.

  The only way to resolve it is if the secret word has an additional A in a position that is not position 2,3,4,5? but thbar positions 2,3,4 are L,O,R? and position 5 is A.

  For example, if the secret word was ""LOARA"", meaning:
     L in position 1
     O in position 2
     A in position 3
     R in position 4
     A in position 5

  Then for guess ""alora"":

   position 1: A (guess) vs. L (secret) -> not match, but the letter A is in the secret (at position 3 and 5) -> so since there are two A's in secret, and one is matched at position 5 (✓), the other at position 3 is unmatched? and the guess has this A at position 1, so it should be (-).

   position 2: L (guess) and O (secret) -> mismatch
   would be: guess L at position 2 and secret O -> so L in secret happens at position 1 but is unmatched by other letters?

  Let me do it properly:

   secret: L O A R A
   positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:A, 4:R, 5:A

   guess:  A L O R A

   Feedback per position:

   position 1: guess A; secret L -> not A, but is the letter A in the secret? Yes, because there are two A's. However, in this Position, there's aL, which is not A. The

   In Wordle, for each guess letter, they are checked against the secret:

   - But the feedback for the position is given first for correct position, then for correct letter but wrong position, and then for absence.

   For guess letter at position 1: letter A.
      - It is not in position 1 in secret (secret has L).
      - However, there is an A in the secret in position 3 and position 5? The position 5 is matched later.
      But typically, we allocate the green ones first, then the yellows.

   More precisely:

   Step 1: Mark exact matches.
      Position 5: A matches -> green.
      Position 4: R matches -> green.
      Position 3: O in guess vs. A in secret -> letter not match.
      Position 2: L in guess vs. O in secret -> not match.
      Position 1: A in guess vs. L in secret -> not match.

   Step 2: For the remaining guess letters that haven't been matched green, mark yellows if the letter appears in unmatched positions in the secret.

   position 1: A is in the secret? Yes, but unmatched (in position 3). So yellow.
   position 2: L is in the secret? Yes, unmatched (in position 1). So yellow.
   position 3: O is in the secret? Yes, unmatched (in position 2). So yellow.
   position 4: already matched.

   So the feedback would be: 
      A(-), L(-), O(-), R(✓ A(✓)

   But our feedback was: A(-) L(✓) O(✓) R(✓) A(✓)

   So it doesn't match because our feedback has L(✓) and o(✓), and also R(✓) and a(✓)

   In this scenario, for the secret ""LOARA"", the guess ""alora"" would get three yellows and two greens? not four greens and one yellow.

   But our feedback for guess4 has only one yellow and four greens? 

   Specifically, L✓ means that L is in the correct position, and O(✓) etc. which requires that position 2 is L and matched? 

   Therefore, secret must have L at position 2.

   Similarly, secret must be ?L?R? with the only open position 1? and we know position 3 is O from feedback?

   So it must be _ L O R a.

   That is fixed.

   The only way is then that the secret has one extra A, and it must be in position 1. Then if secret is ""ALORA"", the feedback for guess ""ALORA"" should be all green, but it was not.

   Unless the word is ""ALORA"" and the first letter of the guess was not 'A'? But guess was ""alora"", so first is A.

   This is confusing.

   Perhaps the fifth letter was matched and the first letter A exists in the secret in a different position? But not position 1? but given the form, it must be position 1 is the only option.

   Given:
      Position 2: L -> must be L
      Position 3: O -> must be O
      Position 4: R -> must be R
      Position 5: A -> must be A
      Position 1: our guess A was not in position to be green, but has a yellow.

   That means secret has A in a position that is not 1. But the only possibility is that secret has A in one of positions 2,3,4? but that's not possible because positions 2,3,4 are fixed to L, O, R and none is A.

   Conclusion: there is an error in my chat in previous asusmptions.

   Let's question the feedback for guess3 ""solar"".

   Guess3: solar -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(-) L(-) A(-) R(-)

   This told us that O, L, A, R are in the word but not in the positions in ""solar"":
      solar: positions 1:s, 2:o, 3:l, 4:a, 5:r

   So secret contains O, L, A, R, just not in positions 2,3,4,5 or at all for O in 2, L in 3, etc.

   But in guess4 with ""alora"", we got four of the five positions fixed: position 2 לן, 3:O, 4:R, 5:A.

   So the only issue is position 1 and the first A letter.

   Given the feedback for ""alora"": the first letter A is in the word (-) but not at position 1.

   Therefore, the secret word must have he letter A occurring in a position other than position 1 and also other than position 5 (since position 5 is already matched by the fifth A).

   But positions 2,3,4 are fixed to L, O, R. So none of them is A.

   The only possibility is that the secret word does not positionally agree for the middle letters? But that is disproved by the feedback for ""alora"":

      L at position 2 is green, O at 3 is green, R at 4 is green, a at 5 is green.

   This must be.so.

   Therefore, the only explanation is to have an additional A in the word, which can only be if one of the letters L, O, R is also an A? That is, a duplicate letter being both L or O or R as well as A? But that's not possible.

   Unless the secret word has ""A"" in position 1 and also in position 5, making ""ALORA"", but then the first letter should be green.

   But it is not.

   This indicates that either there is a mistake in the feedback provided, or we've misinterpreted.

   Let's try to assume that the secret word is ""FLORA"" and ignore the feedback for the first A being (-) and assume it should be (x).

   Then 
      secret: F L O R A
      and the word is_FLORA?

   letters: F, L, O, R, A.

   Then for guess ""alora"" (position 1: A), since there's only one A in secret (position 5), the first A should be (x). But it was reported as (-) by the user.

   So perhaps the user reported the feedback incorrectly.

   Or maybe in this variant. After all, the rules say: '-' means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.

   So for ""alora"" guessed against ""FLORA"", the first letter A is indeed in the secret but not in position 1? Because the secret does contain ('A') although at position 5? But then when we say it is in the word, it is, so it should be '-' even though there's only one A and it in position 5? But the feedback should give:

   - The fifth A is correct, so (✓) for position 5.
   - The first A: since the secret has an A and it's not in position 1, but the A is used you think in at position 5, so it's already matched. In standard Wordle, we only give '-' if there is an unmatched occurrence of the letter in the secret. So for guess ""alora"" and secret ""FLORA"", we would:
        - Match the fifth A? so occurrence of A at position 5 is used.
        - The first A has no unmatched occurrence left, so it should be (x).

   Therefore, if the secret has only one A, we should have first A as (x).

   This suggests the secret has two A's? With one in position 5 and one in a different position.

   But the only position left is position 1, which must then be the extra A? and guess's first A would then match it? 

   This is maddening.

   Perhaps the secret word is ""A L O R A"" and the first letter is something else? How can it be? 

   Given the feedback for guess4 has position 5 as ( a ) , it must be A.

   So the secret's fifth letter is A.

   The only resolution is that the secret wordHas a duplicate in positions 2,3, or 4? For example, position 4 might be A? But it is R->green.

   Perhaps position 3 is A? But it is O->green.

   There is a flaw.

   We must yield to the Feedback system: 
      The secret word is _ L O R A.
      The guess ""alora"" produced: A(-), L( in), O( in), R( in), A( in at position 5).
      This can't happen if the secret has only the one A at position 5.
      Therefore, the secret must have two A's: one at position 5, and another at some position.

   The . But position 2,3,4 are L,O,R, none of which is A? and position 1 must be a different letter.

   Therefore, the secret word has letter for position 1,2,3,4,5 such that:

        1: ? then at ( that letter might be)
        2: L
        3: O
        4: R
        5: A

   And in addition, the letter 4 although R, secretly might be another A? but it is R.

   Or Perhaps position 4 is R and also an A? Which is impossible.

   So the only possibility is that position 1 is not a third letter, but must be the second A? and then it would match the guess's first A and1 be green? but it's not.

   Thus, we are left of no valid explanation.

   Given the time, we guess a word that fits as FLORA, and assume the first A should have been X.

   So For our next guess, we know the format is ? L O R A.

   With ? not being A. Moreover, we have eliminated C,E,N:P,T,Y,S.

   We know from guess1 and guess2 that the word contains A and R and now O and L, so we are missing one letter.

   Weנים have to choose a letter that hasn't been eliminated.

   Available letters: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Z (we used A,L,O,R) - but wait, O is in the word, so. We are anding for the first letter.

   Common letters for the first Position of words ending with ""LORA"": 

   Examples: ""FLORA"" - F is available (not eliminated).

   so I will guess ""FLORA"" next.
   even though the feedback for ""alora"" then would have to have the first A as (x) for that to work.

   If the secret is ""FLORA"", then for 'alora', the first A should be (x), which is not as given.

   But perhaps the user made a mistake in reporting the feedback.

   So, guess: ""FLORA""

   <guess>flora</guess>

   If it's not, we have two tries left.After analyzing the feedback for ""alora"":
- Positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 are confirmed as **L (✓)**, **O (✓)**, **R (✓)**, and **A (✓)** respectively. Thus, the secret word has the structure: `? L O R A`.
- The first letter **A** in ""alora"" received `(-)`, indicating it is in the secret word but not in position 1. However:
  - Position 5 is already `A`, so if the secret has only one `A`, the first `A` in the guess should be `(x)`, not `(-)`. This implies the secret must contain **two** `A`’s: one at position 5, and one elsewhere.
- Given positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed as `L`, `O`, and `R` (all confirmed ✓), the only possible location for the extra `A` is position 1—but this contradicts the `(-)` feedback, as it should be `(✓)` if correct.

### Resolution:
The only way to reconcile this is to infer the secret word uses **two** `A`’s, with one in position 5 and the other in an position that isn't 1. Since positions 2-4 are occupied by `L`, `O`, and `R`, this is impossible for standard word structures. However, given the feedback, the secret word must be ***FLORA***, assuming the feedback for the first `A` in ""alora"" may have been intended as `(x)` instead of `(-)`. This fits:
- **F L O R A**  
- Letter `F` is not eliminated (available).
- `FLORA` is a valid English word.

Thus, the guess is **FLORA**.",Guess 5: flora -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) L(✓) O(✓) R(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
