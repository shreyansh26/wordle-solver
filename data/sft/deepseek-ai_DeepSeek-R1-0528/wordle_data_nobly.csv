First, the user is asking for the first guess in the game. Since it's the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with. I need to choose a good starting word.

A common strategy in word games like Wordle is to pick a word that includes frequently used letters to maximize the information gained. Vowels and common consonants are often good choices.

Looking at English letter frequency, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. For Wordle, words with multiple vowels or a balance of vowels and consonants are preferred.

Some popular starting words are:

- ""CRANE"": Includes C, R, A, N, E – covering common consonants and vowels.

- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – also good coverage.

- ""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T – similar.

I should choose a word that has:

- At least two or three vowels.

- Common consonants.

- No repeating letters, if possible, to cover more ground.

""CRANE"" seems solid: C, R, A, N, E – all fairly common letters, and it has three vowels (A, E) if we consider Y sometimes, but here it's A and E.

Vowels: A and E are vowels, C, R, N are consonants.

""A"" and ""E"" are vowels, ""C"", ""R"", ""N"" are consonants.

Perhaps I should pick a word with more vowels. ""ADIEU"" is another popular starter because it has four vowels: A, I, E, U.

But ""ADIEU"" has D, which is common, but might not be ideal if I want utility consonants.

In Wordle, vowels are crucial because they appear in many words.

Since this is the first guess, my goal is to get as much information as possible, not necessarily to guess the word right away.

After this guess, I'll get feedback, which I can use for subsequent guesses.

For rule compliance: my guess must be a valid 5-letter English word.

I need to ensure that the word I pick is valid.

""CRANE"" is definitely a valid word.

""SLATE"" is fine too.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" for a balanced approach.

""SOARE"" is sometimes used, but ""SOARE"" might be less common; ""CRANE"" is better known.

Another one is ""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E – which has three vowels: A, I, E, and common consonants.

Similarly, ""ROATE"" or ""CRATE"".

But ""CRANE"" is similar.

To maximize letter coverage, ""CRANE"" has five distinct letters: C, R, A, N, E.

E is a vowel, A is a vowel.

In terms of frequency, E, A, R are top letters.

E is the most common letter, A is second or third, depending on source.

According to Wikipedia: E, T, A, O, I, N are the top letters.

""CRANE"" has E, A, but not T? C is less common than T.

""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E – S is common, L is common, A, T, E are top.

T is more common than C.

Letter frequencies: E 12.49%, T 9.28%, A 8.04%, O 7.64%, I 7.57%, N 7.23%, S 6.51%, R 6.28%, H 5.05%, L 4.07%, etc.

""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – S=6.51%, L=4.07%, A=8.04%, T=9.28%, E=12.49%. Average or sum?

Each letter's frequency contributes to the probability.

But ""SLATE"" has no repeated letters and covers high-frequency letters.

Similarly, ""CRANE"": C=3.34%, R=6.28%, A=8.04%, N=7.23%, E=12.49%. C is less frequent.

Perhaps ""ALERT"": A, L, E, R, T – A=8.04%, L=4.07%, E=12.49%, R=6.28%, T=9.28%.

Or ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E – I=7.57%, R=6.28%, A=8.04%, T=9.28%, E=12.49%. ""IRATE"" seems good as it has five of the top seven letters if we consider I and E.

E, T, A, I, N are top five after E, but N is missing.

""RAISE"": R=6.28%, A=8.04%, I=7.57%, S=6.51%, E=12.49%. All high-frequency.

I think ""RAISE"" or ""SLATE"" would be fine.

But I recall that in Wordle, starting words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are often recommended.

Since the user didn't specify a word list, I'll assume any valid English word.

To be safe, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

Another popular choice is ""SOARE"", which is a word meaning a young hawk, but it might be obscure; better to use common words.

""ADIEU"" has A, D, I, E, U – D is common, U is vowel, but D frequency is 3.82%, which is fine.

But ""ADIEU"" focuses on vowels, which might leave consonants uncovered.

I think ""CRANE"" is a good choice for a broad coverage.

I'll use ""CRANE"" as the first guess.

For the response, I need to provide my thought process within <thinking></thinking> tags, and then the guess in <guess></guess> tags.

Specifically:
```xml
<thinking>
[step-by-step thought here]

<guess>CRANE</guess>
```

In the thought process, I should reason step by step.

Thought process:
- For the first guess, no prior information.
- Aim to maximize information by choosing a word with high-frequency letters.
- Selected ""CRANE"" because it contains common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E), all distinct, to cover a wide range.

Make it concise but clear.

For the first guess in this word guessing game, I have no prior feedback or information about the secret word. My goal is to maximize the information I gain by choosing a starting word that covers commonly used English letters. This will help narrow down possibilities with the feedback.

- I prioritize words with high-frequency letters based on English letter frequency (e.g., E, A, R, I, S, T, N) and include both vowels and consonants.
- A good starting word should have no repeating letters to cover more unique letters.
- After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", and ""CRANE"", I select ""CRANE"" because:
  - It contains two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
  - All letters are distinct, covering more ground.
  - ""CRANE"" is a valid English word and frequently used as a starter in similar games for its balanced letter coverage.

After this guess, I will use the feedback symbols (✓, -, x) to inform my next guesses.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, the user is asking for the first guess in the game. Since it's the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with. I need to choose a good starting word.

A common strategy in word games like Wordle is to pick a word that includes frequently used letters to maximize the information gained. Vowels and common consonants are often good choices.

Looking at English letter frequency, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. For Wordle, words with multiple vowels or a balance of vowels and consonants are preferred.

Some popular starting words are:

- ""CRANE"": Includes C, R, A, N, E – covering common consonants and vowels.

- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – also good coverage.

- ""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T – similar.

I should choose a word that has:

- At least two or three vowels.

- Common consonants.

- No repeating letters, if possible, to cover more ground.

""CRANE"" seems solid: C, R, A, N, E – all fairly common letters, and it has three vowels (A, E) if we consider Y sometimes, but here it's A and E.

Vowels: A and E are vowels, C, R, N are consonants.

""A"" and ""E"" are vowels, ""C"", ""R"", ""N"" are consonants.

Perhaps I should pick a word with more vowels. ""ADIEU"" is another popular starter because it has four vowels: A, I, E, U.

But ""ADIEU"" has D, which is common, but might not be ideal if I want utility consonants.

In Wordle, vowels are crucial because they appear in many words.

Since this is the first guess, my goal is to get as much information as possible, not necessarily to guess the word right away.

After this guess, I'll get feedback, which I can use for subsequent guesses.

For rule compliance: my guess must be a valid 5-letter English word.

I need to ensure that the word I pick is valid.

""CRANE"" is definitely a valid word.

""SLATE"" is fine too.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" for a balanced approach.

""SOARE"" is sometimes used, but ""SOARE"" might be less common; ""CRANE"" is better known.

Another one is ""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E – which has three vowels: A, I, E, and common consonants.

Similarly, ""ROATE"" or ""CRATE"".

But ""CRANE"" is similar.

To maximize letter coverage, ""CRANE"" has five distinct letters: C, R, A, N, E.

E is a vowel, A is a vowel.

In terms of frequency, E, A, R are top letters.

E is the most common letter, A is second or third, depending on source.

According to Wikipedia: E, T, A, O, I, N are the top letters.

""CRANE"" has E, A, but not T? C is less common than T.

""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E – S is common, L is common, A, T, E are top.

T is more common than C.

Letter frequencies: E 12.49%, T 9.28%, A 8.04%, O 7.64%, I 7.57%, N 7.23%, S 6.51%, R 6.28%, H 5.05%, L 4.07%, etc.

""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – S=6.51%, L=4.07%, A=8.04%, T=9.28%, E=12.49%. Average or sum?

Each letter's frequency contributes to the probability.

But ""SLATE"" has no repeated letters and covers high-frequency letters.

Similarly, ""CRANE"": C=3.34%, R=6.28%, A=8.04%, N=7.23%, E=12.49%. C is less frequent.

Perhaps ""ALERT"": A, L, E, R, T – A=8.04%, L=4.07%, E=12.49%, R=6.28%, T=9.28%.

Or ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E – I=7.57%, R=6.28%, A=8.04%, T=9.28%, E=12.49%. ""IRATE"" seems good as it has five of the top seven letters if we consider I and E.

E, T, A, I, N are top five after E, but N is missing.

""RAISE"": R=6.28%, A=8.04%, I=7.57%, S=6.51%, E=12.49%. All high-frequency.

I think ""RAISE"" or ""SLATE"" would be fine.

But I recall that in Wordle, starting words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are often recommended.

Since the user didn't specify a word list, I'll assume any valid English word.

To be safe, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

Another popular choice is ""SOARE"", which is a word meaning a young hawk, but it might be obscure; better to use common words.

""ADIEU"" has A, D, I, E, U – D is common, U is vowel, but D frequency is 3.82%, which is fine.

But ""ADIEU"" focuses on vowels, which might leave consonants uncovered.

I think ""CRANE"" is a good choice for a broad coverage.

I'll use ""CRANE"" as the first guess.

For the response, I need to provide my thought process within <thinking></thinking> tags, and then the guess in <guess></guess> tags.

Specifically:
```xml
<thinking>
[step-by-step thought here]
</thinking>
<guess>CRANE</guess>
```

In the thought process, I should reason step by step.

Thought process:
- For the first guess, no prior information.
- Aim to maximize information by choosing a word with high-frequency letters.
- Selected ""CRANE"" because it contains common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E), all distinct, to cover a wide range.

Make it concise but clear.<thinking>
For the first guess in this word guessing game, I have no prior feedback or information about the secret word. My goal is to maximize the information I gain by choosing a starting word that covers commonly used English letters. This will help narrow down possibilities with the feedback.

- I prioritize words with high-frequency letters based on English letter frequency (e.g., E, A, R, I, S, T, N) and include both vowels and consonants.
- A good starting word should have no repeating letters to cover more unique letters.
- After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", and ""CRANE"", I select ""CRANE"" because:
  - It contains two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
  - All letters are distinct, covering more ground.
  - ""CRANE"" is a valid English word and frequently used as a starter in similar games for its balanced letter coverage.

After this guess, I will use the feedback symbols (✓, -, x) to inform my next guesses.

- Guess 1: Invalid (not five letters) – no useful information.
- Guess 2: ""CRANE"" with feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)

Interpretation of feedback for ""CRANE"":
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

Therefore, from this feedback, we know:
1. The letter N is present in the word, but not in the 4th position (since ""CRANE"" has N as the 4th letter).
2. The letters C, R, A, E are absent from the word.
3. Since only N is present, the word must contain N.

Additional constraints:
- The word is 5 letters long.
- We must avoid using C, R, A, E in any position.

We need to select a new guess that:
- Includes the letter N (because N is somewhere in the word).
- Does not include C, R, A, E (since they are confirmed absent).
- The letter N cannot be in the 4th position (because in ""CRANE"" it was in the 4th and got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but wrong position).

Possible positions for N: it can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

We also want to guess a word that covers new common letters to gain more information.

Available letters: We can use any letters except C, R, A, E. It's safe to avoid these.

Common letters to consider: T, O, I, S, H, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

We should aim for a word that includes N and other high-frequency letters not yet ruled out.

Since N is present, we can prioritize words that have N and also introduce vowels or consonants we haven't tested.

Vowels we can still use: O, I, U (since A and E are out).

Common consonants: T, S, L, etc.

A good candidate might include N and another vowel or two.

For example:
- Words like ""POINT"", but ""POINT"" has E? No, P,O,I,N,T – no E or A. But E is ruled out, so it's okay? Wait, no E, so good.
- However, we need to avoid C,R,A,E.

""POINT"": P,O,I,N,T – letters are P,O,I,N,T. None of C,R,A,E. And N is included.

But in ""POINT"", N is at position 4. But we know N cannot be in position 4? Wait, it can be in other positions? The feedback says N is in the word but not in position 4. So in a new word, N could be in position 1,2,3,5.

In ""POINT"", N is in position 4, but since the word has N in position 4, but the actual word has N not in position 4? The feedback doesn't say that N can't be in position 4 in general, only that in the secret word, N is not in position 4. So for our guess, we can place N in position 4 again, but that is still wrong, so it might give ""-"" again if N is elsewhere. But we know for sure that N is not at position 4 in the secret word.

Therefore, in our new guess, to gain more information, it's better to place N in a different position: positions 1,2,3, or 5.

But we don't know which, so perhaps try N in another position.

Also, we want to test other letters.

So, a word with N not in the 4th position and avoiding C,R,A,E.

Possible words:
- Option: ""SNOWY"" – S,N,O,W,Y. N is in position 2. Avoided C,R,A,E? R is ruled out, but S,N,O,W,Y are all different.
- Or ""UNITY"" – U,N,I,T,Y. N at position 2. Avoids C,R,A,E.

But ""SNOWY"" has Y, which is less common.

Better to use more common letters: T, O, I, S, etc.

Another word: ""TONIC"" – T,O,N,I,C. But C is ruled out! Cannot use C.

Avoid C.

So ""TONIC"" is invalid.

Perhaps ""POINT"" but with N not at 4: isn't that fixed? We need a word with N not at 4? No, we can use any position, but N not at 4 in the secret.

For guessing, we can place N anywhere, but it might be more informative to put it in a position we haven't tested yet.

Since position 4 is ruled out, we can test, say position 1 or 2.

For example, ""NOSEY"" – N,O,S,E,Y. But E is ruled out! Cannot use E.

We must avoid E.

So words without E or A,C,R.

List possible vowels: O, I, U, Y (sometimes), but Y is consonant too.

Common words without E or A: for example, ""POUND"", ""MOUND"", etc.

""POUND"": P,O,U,N,D. N at position 4? Position 4 is N? But N cannot be at position 4 in the secret word? In ""POUND"", N is at 4, but we suspect it's wrong because in ""CRANE"" N at 4 got ""-"", meaning it exists but elsewhere. So if we put N at 4 again, and if it's not in secret at 4, we get ""-"", but we already know that. Waste of a position.

Better to put N at a new position to test it.

So positions available: 1,2,3,5.

Perhaps put N at position 1 or 5.

Try ""NIGHT"": N,I,G,H,T. N at position 1. Avoids C,R,A,E? I, G, H, T – yes.

""NIFTY"": N,I,F,T,Y – also possible.

But ""OUIJA"" is a word but not common; avoid.

""INPUT"": I,N,P,U,T – N at position 2.

""MINTS"": M,I,N,T,S – N at position 3.

To cover multiple new letters: select a word with O, I, U and consonants like T,S,L.

Avoid C,R,A,E.

""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T – no N? But we must include N because we know it's in the word.

We must include N, otherwise if N isn't in the guess, we won't get info if there are other positions.

If we don't put N, we might miss confirming its position or presence.

No, since we know N is present, we should include it to find its position.

In this guess, include N in a new position.

Also, introduce other common letters not used or ruled out.

Letters not tried: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z but avoid C,R,A,E specifically.

Most common available: S, T, O, I, L, U, etc.

A good word with N and these.

Possible candidate: ""POINT"" but N at 4, which might not be optimal for position testing.

""JOINT"": J,O,I,N,T – J is less common.

Better: ""UNLIT"" – U,N,L,I,T. N at position 2.

Or ""SNAIL"" but A is ruled out. Cannot.

Since A and E are out, words with O, I, U vowels.

Another idea: ""THINK"" – T,H,I,N,K. N at position 4? Position 4 is N.

Position: in ""THINK"", positions: 1-T,2-H,3-I,4-N,5-K.

N at 4, same issue.

""STINK"": S,T,I,N,K – N at 4.

Many words have N at 4.

To avoid position 4, try words like ""SNOUT"" – S,N,O,U,T. N at 2.

""CLING"" but C is out.

""BLUNT"": B,L,U,N,T. N at 4? Positions:1-B,2-L,3-U,4-N,5-T. N at 4 again.

""NUDGE"" has E, out.

""DOWNY"" – D,O,W,N,Y. N at 4? Positions: 1-D,2-O,3-W,4-N,5-Y. N at 4.

It's hard to find words with N not at 4.

Position N at 1: ""NOISE"" – has E, out.

""NAIVE"" – A and E out.

""NOMAD"" – A out.

""NOTCH"" – C out? C is ruled out.

""NYMPH"" – N,Y,M,P,H.

""NYMPH"" is a word: N at position 1.

Letters: N,Y,M,P,H – all permissible? Y,M,P,H are allowed, since C,R,A,E are the only rules.

H not ruled out.

Similarly, ""LYMPH"" is also a word, but L,Y,M,P,H.

But ""NYMPH"" is better.

Or ""NIGHT"" as I thought.

But ""NYMPH"" might be obscure.

Better common words: ""KNOWN"" – has repeated N? Positions: K,N,O,W,N – N at positions 2 and 5? Repeated letters? But ""KNOWN"" has double N, but we don't know if secret has repeated letters, but usually it's better to avoid repeats for information.

Assume no repeats for now.

""TIMID"" – no N.

""POUND"" – N at 4.

""MOUNT"" – M,O,U,N,T – N at 4.

Why not place N at position 3 or 5?

For example, ""BANJO"" but A out.

""PINKO"" – P,I,N,K,O – N at position 3.

Letters P,I,N,K,O – all allowed? O is vowel, P,I,K,O and N.

P,I,N,K,O: no C,R,A,E.

K might be less common, but possible.

Another word: ""LINGO"" – L,I,N,G,O – N at 3? Positions: L,I,N,G,O – N position 3.

Good.

""MINTO"" might not be common.

""STUNG"" – S,T,U,N,G – N at 4? Positions: S,T,U,N,G – N position 4.

Always at 4 or repeated.

""USING"" – U,S,I,N,G – N at 4.

Perhaps ""HINGE"" has E, out.

To have N at 5: words ending with N, like ""WINN"" not 5 letters; ""BEGIN"" has E? B,E,G,I,N – E is ruled out.

""ROBIN"" has R, ruled out.

""SPAIN"" has A and S,P,I,N but A out.

""BRAIN"" has B,R,A,I,N – R and A out.

So hard to find words with N at end without A or E.

""GIVEN"" has E.

""OXBOW"" no N.

""CUMIN"" has C and U,M,I,N – C ruled out.

""TUMID"" – no E or A? T,U,M,I,D – no N.

Perhaps ""UNPIN"" – U,N,P,I,N – repeated N, not ideal.

Another word: ""QUINT"" – Q,U,I,N,T – Q less common.

But valid.

Perhaps ""POINT"" but N at 4, we can use it, and since we know N not at 4, we place it at 4 and get ""-"" again, but we also test other letters.

To save a turn and gain more info, it's better to move N.

Ideal: ""SNAKY"" – S,N,A,K,Y but A out.

""DOING"" – D,O,I,N,G – N at 4.

Positions: 1-D,2-O,3-I,4-N,5-G. N at 4.

But we can accept N at a different position? Like position 1 or 2 etc.

For example, ""KNIFE"" has E and F.

""WHINE"" has E.

""SHINY"" – S,H,I,N,Y – N at 4? Positions: S,H,I,N,Y – N position 4.

List words with N not at position 4.

- Position 1: ""NOISY"" but O,I,S,Y – N at 1? ""NOISY"" has S and Y, but letters N,O,I,S,Y – O and I vowels. But position: N at 1.

""NOISY"" is valid.

""NUTSY"" not common.

""NEWSY"" has E? N,E,W,S,Y – E ruled out.

""NOXIOUS"" too long.

""NASTY"" has S,T,Y but A out.

""NADIR"" has A and R out.

""NEIGH"" has E.

So ""NOISY"": N,O,I,S,Y – N at position 1.

No C,R,E,A.

Yes.

Similarly, ""NOUNS"" – N,O,U,N,S – N at 1 and 4, repeated.

Bad.

""LOINS"" – L,O,I,N,S – N at position 4.

So ""NOISY"" seems okay.

"" TIMID"" no N.

Another option: ""UNITY"" – U,N,I,T,Y – N at position 2.

U and I vowels.

""UNIFY"" also valid, U,N,I,F,Y.

Or ""ONION"" repeated O.

Avoid.

So ""UNITY"" or ""NOISY"".

""NOISY"" has S and Y, ""UNITY"" has T and Y.

Both include Y, which might be less common.

But permissible.

Perhaps ""MOUNT"" but N at 4.

I think ""NOISY"" or ""UNITY"" are fine.

To prioritize common letters, ""STOIC"" has C? No, C out.

""POINTS"" too long.

Five-letter word.

Another common word without E/A: ""PILOT"" but no N.

Must include N.

So I'll go with ""UNITY"": U,N,I,T,Y – letters U, N, I, T, Y.

N is at position 2.

Feedback will tell us if N is at position 2 or not.

Also test U, I, T, Y.

If U, I, T, Y are present or not.

But since no C,R,A,E, it's safe.

""UNITY"" might be a good choice.

To avoid Y, use another word.

""INPUT"": I,N,P,U,T – N at 2.

Similarly, P is less common than T in ""UNITY"".

But T is more frequent.

T frequency 9.28%, P is 2.03%, so ""UNITY"" with T is better than ""INPUT"" with P.

""UNITY"" has U,N,I,T,Y.

Y frequency is about 1.66%, low.

""UNTIL"" – U,N,T,I,L – L is common.

""UNTIL"" : U,N,T,I,L – positions:1-U,2-N,3-T,4-I,5-L. N at 2.

L is better than Y.

Letters U,N,T,I,L.

Frequency: U=3.10%, N=7.23%, T=9.28%, I=7.57%, L=4.07%. Better than Y.

And avoid C,R,A,E.

""UNTIL"" is a valid English word.

Perfect.

Similarly, ""LINED"" has E.

So ""UNTIL"" is better.

Therefore, choose ""UNTIL"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback for ""CRANE"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x), we know:
- Letters C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.
- The letter N **is** in the word, but not in the 4th position (since it received ""-"" in position 4 of ""CRANE"").

For the new guess:
- Must include the letter N (as it is present) but not in the 4th position.
- Avoid using C, R, A, E entirely.
- Should cover new common letters to maximize information gain. Prioritizing high-frequency letters like T, I, U, L, O, S, etc., while ensuring the word is valid and has no repeated letters for better coverage.

After evaluating options:
- Chose ""UNTIL"" because:
  - It includes N in position 2 (a new position to test).
  - Contains other common letters: U, T, I, L (all untested and high-frequency).
  - No ruled-out letters (C, R, A, E), and all letters are distinct.
  - Helps test vowels U/I and consonants T/L.

This guess should provide valuable feedback to narrow down the secret word.

<thinking>
- Summary of previous feedback: Only N is present (wrong position), C/R/A/E absent.
- Goal: Guess a 5-letter word including N, not in position 4, avoiding C/R/A/E.
- Selected ""UNTIL"" because:
  - N is in position 2 (testing a new position).
  - Uses high-frequency untested letters U, T, I, L.
  - Vali English word with distinct letters for maximum information.
- Expected to gain feedback on N's position and presence of U/T/I/L.
</thinking>

<guess>UNTIL</guess>",UNTIL,"We are given feedback from two previous guesses:
- Guess 1: Invalid (not five letters) – no useful information.
- Guess 2: ""CRANE"" with feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)

Interpretation of feedback for ""CRANE"":
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

Therefore, from this feedback, we know:
1. The letter N is present in the word, but not in the 4th position (since ""CRANE"" has N as the 4th letter).
2. The letters C, R, A, E are absent from the word.
3. Since only N is present, the word must contain N.

Additional constraints:
- The word is 5 letters long.
- We must avoid using C, R, A, E in any position.

We need to select a new guess that:
- Includes the letter N (because N is somewhere in the word).
- Does not include C, R, A, E (since they are confirmed absent).
- The letter N cannot be in the 4th position (because in ""CRANE"" it was in the 4th and got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but wrong position).

Possible positions for N: it can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

We also want to guess a word that covers new common letters to gain more information.

Available letters: We can use any letters except C, R, A, E. It's safe to avoid these.

Common letters to consider: T, O, I, S, H, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

We should aim for a word that includes N and other high-frequency letters not yet ruled out.

Since N is present, we can prioritize words that have N and also introduce vowels or consonants we haven't tested.

Vowels we can still use: O, I, U (since A and E are out).

Common consonants: T, S, L, etc.

A good candidate might include N and another vowel or two.

For example:
- Words like ""POINT"", but ""POINT"" has E? No, P,O,I,N,T – no E or A. But E is ruled out, so it's okay? Wait, no E, so good.
- However, we need to avoid C,R,A,E.

""POINT"": P,O,I,N,T – letters are P,O,I,N,T. None of C,R,A,E. And N is included.

But in ""POINT"", N is at position 4. But we know N cannot be in position 4? Wait, it can be in other positions? The feedback says N is in the word but not in position 4. So in a new word, N could be in position 1,2,3,5.

In ""POINT"", N is in position 4, but since the word has N in position 4, but the actual word has N not in position 4? The feedback doesn't say that N can't be in position 4 in general, only that in the secret word, N is not in position 4. So for our guess, we can place N in position 4 again, but that is still wrong, so it might give ""-"" again if N is elsewhere. But we know for sure that N is not at position 4 in the secret word.

Therefore, in our new guess, to gain more information, it's better to place N in a different position: positions 1,2,3, or 5.

But we don't know which, so perhaps try N in another position.

Also, we want to test other letters.

So, a word with N not in the 4th position and avoiding C,R,A,E.

Possible words:
- Option: ""SNOWY"" – S,N,O,W,Y. N is in position 2. Avoided C,R,A,E? R is ruled out, but S,N,O,W,Y are all different.
- Or ""UNITY"" – U,N,I,T,Y. N at position 2. Avoids C,R,A,E.

But ""SNOWY"" has Y, which is less common.

Better to use more common letters: T, O, I, S, etc.

Another word: ""TONIC"" – T,O,N,I,C. But C is ruled out! Cannot use C.

Avoid C.

So ""TONIC"" is invalid.

Perhaps ""POINT"" but with N not at 4: isn't that fixed? We need a word with N not at 4? No, we can use any position, but N not at 4 in the secret.

For guessing, we can place N anywhere, but it might be more informative to put it in a position we haven't tested yet.

Since position 4 is ruled out, we can test, say position 1 or 2.

For example, ""NOSEY"" – N,O,S,E,Y. But E is ruled out! Cannot use E.

We must avoid E.

So words without E or A,C,R.

List possible vowels: O, I, U, Y (sometimes), but Y is consonant too.

Common words without E or A: for example, ""POUND"", ""MOUND"", etc.

""POUND"": P,O,U,N,D. N at position 4? Position 4 is N? But N cannot be at position 4 in the secret word? In ""POUND"", N is at 4, but we suspect it's wrong because in ""CRANE"" N at 4 got ""-"", meaning it exists but elsewhere. So if we put N at 4 again, and if it's not in secret at 4, we get ""-"", but we already know that. Waste of a position.

Better to put N at a new position to test it.

So positions available: 1,2,3,5.

Perhaps put N at position 1 or 5.

Try ""NIGHT"": N,I,G,H,T. N at position 1. Avoids C,R,A,E? I, G, H, T – yes.

""NIFTY"": N,I,F,T,Y – also possible.

But ""OUIJA"" is a word but not common; avoid.

""INPUT"": I,N,P,U,T – N at position 2.

""MINTS"": M,I,N,T,S – N at position 3.

To cover multiple new letters: select a word with O, I, U and consonants like T,S,L.

Avoid C,R,A,E.

""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T – no N? But we must include N because we know it's in the word.

We must include N, otherwise if N isn't in the guess, we won't get info if there are other positions.

If we don't put N, we might miss confirming its position or presence.

No, since we know N is present, we should include it to find its position.

In this guess, include N in a new position.

Also, introduce other common letters not used or ruled out.

Letters not tried: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z but avoid C,R,A,E specifically.

Most common available: S, T, O, I, L, U, etc.

A good word with N and these.

Possible candidate: ""POINT"" but N at 4, which might not be optimal for position testing.

""JOINT"": J,O,I,N,T – J is less common.

Better: ""UNLIT"" – U,N,L,I,T. N at position 2.

Or ""SNAIL"" but A is ruled out. Cannot.

Since A and E are out, words with O, I, U vowels.

Another idea: ""THINK"" – T,H,I,N,K. N at position 4? Position 4 is N.

Position: in ""THINK"", positions: 1-T,2-H,3-I,4-N,5-K.

N at 4, same issue.

""STINK"": S,T,I,N,K – N at 4.

Many words have N at 4.

To avoid position 4, try words like ""SNOUT"" – S,N,O,U,T. N at 2.

""CLING"" but C is out.

""BLUNT"": B,L,U,N,T. N at 4? Positions:1-B,2-L,3-U,4-N,5-T. N at 4 again.

""NUDGE"" has E, out.

""DOWNY"" – D,O,W,N,Y. N at 4? Positions: 1-D,2-O,3-W,4-N,5-Y. N at 4.

It's hard to find words with N not at 4.

Position N at 1: ""NOISE"" – has E, out.

""NAIVE"" – A and E out.

""NOMAD"" – A out.

""NOTCH"" – C out? C is ruled out.

""NYMPH"" – N,Y,M,P,H.

""NYMPH"" is a word: N at position 1.

Letters: N,Y,M,P,H – all permissible? Y,M,P,H are allowed, since C,R,A,E are the only rules.

H not ruled out.

Similarly, ""LYMPH"" is also a word, but L,Y,M,P,H.

But ""NYMPH"" is better.

Or ""NIGHT"" as I thought.

But ""NYMPH"" might be obscure.

Better common words: ""KNOWN"" – has repeated N? Positions: K,N,O,W,N – N at positions 2 and 5? Repeated letters? But ""KNOWN"" has double N, but we don't know if secret has repeated letters, but usually it's better to avoid repeats for information.

Assume no repeats for now.

""TIMID"" – no N.

""POUND"" – N at 4.

""MOUNT"" – M,O,U,N,T – N at 4.

Why not place N at position 3 or 5?

For example, ""BANJO"" but A out.

""PINKO"" – P,I,N,K,O – N at position 3.

Letters P,I,N,K,O – all allowed? O is vowel, P,I,K,O and N.

P,I,N,K,O: no C,R,A,E.

K might be less common, but possible.

Another word: ""LINGO"" – L,I,N,G,O – N at 3? Positions: L,I,N,G,O – N position 3.

Good.

""MINTO"" might not be common.

""STUNG"" – S,T,U,N,G – N at 4? Positions: S,T,U,N,G – N position 4.

Always at 4 or repeated.

""USING"" – U,S,I,N,G – N at 4.

Perhaps ""HINGE"" has E, out.

To have N at 5: words ending with N, like ""WINN"" not 5 letters; ""BEGIN"" has E? B,E,G,I,N – E is ruled out.

""ROBIN"" has R, ruled out.

""SPAIN"" has A and S,P,I,N but A out.

""BRAIN"" has B,R,A,I,N – R and A out.

So hard to find words with N at end without A or E.

""GIVEN"" has E.

""OXBOW"" no N.

""CUMIN"" has C and U,M,I,N – C ruled out.

""TUMID"" – no E or A? T,U,M,I,D – no N.

Perhaps ""UNPIN"" – U,N,P,I,N – repeated N, not ideal.

Another word: ""QUINT"" – Q,U,I,N,T – Q less common.

But valid.

Perhaps ""POINT"" but N at 4, we can use it, and since we know N not at 4, we place it at 4 and get ""-"" again, but we also test other letters.

To save a turn and gain more info, it's better to move N.

Ideal: ""SNAKY"" – S,N,A,K,Y but A out.

""DOING"" – D,O,I,N,G – N at 4.

Positions: 1-D,2-O,3-I,4-N,5-G. N at 4.

But we can accept N at a different position? Like position 1 or 2 etc.

For example, ""KNIFE"" has E and F.

""WHINE"" has E.

""SHINY"" – S,H,I,N,Y – N at 4? Positions: S,H,I,N,Y – N position 4.

List words with N not at position 4.

- Position 1: ""NOISY"" but O,I,S,Y – N at 1? ""NOISY"" has S and Y, but letters N,O,I,S,Y – O and I vowels. But position: N at 1.

""NOISY"" is valid.

""NUTSY"" not common.

""NEWSY"" has E? N,E,W,S,Y – E ruled out.

""NOXIOUS"" too long.

""NASTY"" has S,T,Y but A out.

""NADIR"" has A and R out.

""NEIGH"" has E.

So ""NOISY"": N,O,I,S,Y – N at position 1.

No C,R,E,A.

Yes.

Similarly, ""NOUNS"" – N,O,U,N,S – N at 1 and 4, repeated.

Bad.

""LOINS"" – L,O,I,N,S – N at position 4.

So ""NOISY"" seems okay.

"" TIMID"" no N.

Another option: ""UNITY"" – U,N,I,T,Y – N at position 2.

U and I vowels.

""UNIFY"" also valid, U,N,I,F,Y.

Or ""ONION"" repeated O.

Avoid.

So ""UNITY"" or ""NOISY"".

""NOISY"" has S and Y, ""UNITY"" has T and Y.

Both include Y, which might be less common.

But permissible.

Perhaps ""MOUNT"" but N at 4.

I think ""NOISY"" or ""UNITY"" are fine.

To prioritize common letters, ""STOIC"" has C? No, C out.

""POINTS"" too long.

Five-letter word.

Another common word without E/A: ""PILOT"" but no N.

Must include N.

So I'll go with ""UNITY"": U,N,I,T,Y – letters U, N, I, T, Y.

N is at position 2.

Feedback will tell us if N is at position 2 or not.

Also test U, I, T, Y.

If U, I, T, Y are present or not.

But since no C,R,A,E, it's safe.

""UNITY"" might be a good choice.

To avoid Y, use another word.

""INPUT"": I,N,P,U,T – N at 2.

Similarly, P is less common than T in ""UNITY"".

But T is more frequent.

T frequency 9.28%, P is 2.03%, so ""UNITY"" with T is better than ""INPUT"" with P.

""UNITY"" has U,N,I,T,Y.

Y frequency is about 1.66%, low.

""UNTIL"" – U,N,T,I,L – L is common.

""UNTIL"" : U,N,T,I,L – positions:1-U,2-N,3-T,4-I,5-L. N at 2.

L is better than Y.

Letters U,N,T,I,L.

Frequency: U=3.10%, N=7.23%, T=9.28%, I=7.57%, L=4.07%. Better than Y.

And avoid C,R,A,E.

""UNTIL"" is a valid English word.

Perfect.

Similarly, ""LINED"" has E.

So ""UNTIL"" is better.

Therefore, choose ""UNTIL"".Based on the previous feedback for ""CRANE"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x), we know:
- Letters C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.
- The letter N **is** in the word, but not in the 4th position (since it received ""-"" in position 4 of ""CRANE"").

For the new guess:
- Must include the letter N (as it is present) but not in the 4th position.
- Avoid using C, R, A, E entirely.
- Should cover new common letters to maximize information gain. Prioritizing high-frequency letters like T, I, U, L, O, S, etc., while ensuring the word is valid and has no repeated letters for better coverage.

After evaluating options:
- Chose ""UNTIL"" because:
  - It includes N in position 2 (a new position to test).
  - Contains other common letters: U, T, I, L (all untested and high-frequency).
  - No ruled-out letters (C, R, A, E), and all letters are distinct.
  - Helps test vowels U/I and consonants T/L.

This guess should provide valuable feedback to narrow down the secret word.

<thinking>
- Summary of previous feedback: Only N is present (wrong position), C/R/A/E absent.
- Goal: Guess a 5-letter word including N, not in position 4, avoiding C/R/A/E.
- Selected ""UNTIL"" because:
  - N is in position 2 (testing a new position).
  - Uses high-frequency untested letters U, T, I, L.
  - Vali English word with distinct letters for maximum information.
- Expected to gain feedback on N's position and presence of U/T/I/L.

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, the user is asking for the first guess in the game. Since it's the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with. I need to choose a good starting word.

A common strategy in word games like Wordle is to pick a word that includes frequently used letters to maximize the information gained. Vowels and common consonants are often good choices.

Looking at English letter frequency, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. For Wordle, words with multiple vowels or a balance of vowels and consonants are preferred.

Some popular starting words are:

- ""CRANE"": Includes C, R, A, N, E – covering common consonants and vowels.

- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – also good coverage.

- ""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T – similar.

I should choose a word that has:

- At least two or three vowels.

- Common consonants.

- No repeating letters, if possible, to cover more ground.

""CRANE"" seems solid: C, R, A, N, E – all fairly common letters, and it has three vowels (A, E) if we consider Y sometimes, but here it's A and E.

Vowels: A and E are vowels, C, R, N are consonants.

""A"" and ""E"" are vowels, ""C"", ""R"", ""N"" are consonants.

Perhaps I should pick a word with more vowels. ""ADIEU"" is another popular starter because it has four vowels: A, I, E, U.

But ""ADIEU"" has D, which is common, but might not be ideal if I want utility consonants.

In Wordle, vowels are crucial because they appear in many words.

Since this is the first guess, my goal is to get as much information as possible, not necessarily to guess the word right away.

After this guess, I'll get feedback, which I can use for subsequent guesses.

For rule compliance: my guess must be a valid 5-letter English word.

I need to ensure that the word I pick is valid.

""CRANE"" is definitely a valid word.

""SLATE"" is fine too.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" for a balanced approach.

""SOARE"" is sometimes used, but ""SOARE"" might be less common; ""CRANE"" is better known.

Another one is ""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E – which has three vowels: A, I, E, and common consonants.

Similarly, ""ROATE"" or ""CRATE"".

But ""CRANE"" is similar.

To maximize letter coverage, ""CRANE"" has five distinct letters: C, R, A, N, E.

E is a vowel, A is a vowel.

In terms of frequency, E, A, R are top letters.

E is the most common letter, A is second or third, depending on source.

According to Wikipedia: E, T, A, O, I, N are the top letters.

""CRANE"" has E, A, but not T? C is less common than T.

""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E – S is common, L is common, A, T, E are top.

T is more common than C.

Letter frequencies: E 12.49%, T 9.28%, A 8.04%, O 7.64%, I 7.57%, N 7.23%, S 6.51%, R 6.28%, H 5.05%, L 4.07%, etc.

""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – S=6.51%, L=4.07%, A=8.04%, T=9.28%, E=12.49%. Average or sum?

Each letter's frequency contributes to the probability.

But ""SLATE"" has no repeated letters and covers high-frequency letters.

Similarly, ""CRANE"": C=3.34%, R=6.28%, A=8.04%, N=7.23%, E=12.49%. C is less frequent.

Perhaps ""ALERT"": A, L, E, R, T – A=8.04%, L=4.07%, E=12.49%, R=6.28%, T=9.28%.

Or ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E – I=7.57%, R=6.28%, A=8.04%, T=9.28%, E=12.49%. ""IRATE"" seems good as it has five of the top seven letters if we consider I and E.

E, T, A, I, N are top five after E, but N is missing.

""RAISE"": R=6.28%, A=8.04%, I=7.57%, S=6.51%, E=12.49%. All high-frequency.

I think ""RAISE"" or ""SLATE"" would be fine.

But I recall that in Wordle, starting words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are often recommended.

Since the user didn't specify a word list, I'll assume any valid English word.

To be safe, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

Another popular choice is ""SOARE"", which is a word meaning a young hawk, but it might be obscure; better to use common words.

""ADIEU"" has A, D, I, E, U – D is common, U is vowel, but D frequency is 3.82%, which is fine.

But ""ADIEU"" focuses on vowels, which might leave consonants uncovered.

I think ""CRANE"" is a good choice for a broad coverage.

I'll use ""CRANE"" as the first guess.

For the response, I need to provide my thought process within <thinking></thinking> tags, and then the guess in <guess></guess> tags.

Specifically:
```xml
<thinking>
[step-by-step thought here]
</thinking>
<guess>CRANE</guess>
```

In the thought process, I should reason step by step.

Thought process:
- For the first guess, no prior information.
- Aim to maximize information by choosing a word with high-frequency letters.
- Selected ""CRANE"" because it contains common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E), all distinct, to cover a wide range.

Make it concise but clear.<thinking>
For the first guess in this word guessing game, I have no prior feedback or information about the secret word. My goal is to maximize the information I gain by choosing a starting word that covers commonly used English letters. This will help narrow down possibilities with the feedback.

- I prioritize words with high-frequency letters based on English letter frequency (e.g., E, A, R, I, S, T, N) and include both vowels and consonants.
- A good starting word should have no repeating letters to cover more unique letters.
- After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", and ""CRANE"", I select ""CRANE"" because:
  - It contains two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
  - All letters are distinct, covering more ground.
  - ""CRANE"" is a valid English word and frequently used as a starter in similar games for its balanced letter coverage.

After this guess, I will use the feedback symbols (✓, -, x) to inform my next guesses.
</thinking>

<guess></guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1:  -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are at the beginning of the game. The user says: ""Make your first 5-letter word guess."" and then in the same message, they provide feedback that the first guess was invalid because it was not five letters. However, looking back, I didn't make a guess yet in this conversation. The user's message is: ""Make your first 5-letter word guess."" and then they add: ""Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.""

This seems like the user is simulating that I already made a guess that was invalid. But in reality, this is the first interaction. So I need to make the first valid guess.

The feedback says: ""Model answer is not five letters."" meaning that in a previous attempt, the model's answer was not five letters. But since this is the start, I should provide a five-letter word.

I think the user is setting up a scenario where my first attempt was invalid, so now I must provide a new first guess that is five letters.

Therefore, I should proceed to make a valid five-letter word guess.

I'll use the same reasoning as before and choose ""CRANE"".

But to be thorough, let me think again.

First guess: I need a valid 5-letter English word.

I choose ""CRANE"" for the reasons stated.

So, my response should be:

<thinking>
I see that a previous guess was invalid because it was not five letters. For this new first guess, I will ensure it is a valid 5-letter word. I choose ""CRANE"" as it contains common letters (C, R, A, N, E) to maximize information gain. All letters are distinct and it is a common starting word in word games.
</thinking>
<guess>CRANE</guess><thinking>
The previous feedback indicates that the initial guess was invalid because it was not a 5-letter word. For this new first guess, I must ensure the word is exactly 5 letters long and a valid English word. 

- Since this is the first valid guess, I aim to maximize information by selecting a word with high-frequency English letters (e.g., vowels and common consonants) and no repeating characters.
- Based on English letter frequency (E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S being among the most common), I consider words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"".
- I choose ""CRANE"" because:
  - It contains two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
  - All letters are distinct, covering a broad range of possibilities.
  - It is a recognized starting word in word games for its effectiveness.

This guess will provide feedback (✓, -, or x for each letter) to guide subsequent guesses.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1:  -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 2: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two previous guesses:
- Guess 1: Invalid (not five letters) – no useful information.
- Guess 2: ""CRANE"" with feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)

Interpretation of feedback for ""CRANE"":
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

Therefore, from this feedback, we know:
1. The letter N is present in the word, but not in the 4th position (since ""CRANE"" has N as the 4th letter).
2. The letters C, R, A, E are absent from the word.
3. Since only N is present, the word must contain N.

Additional constraints:
- The word is 5 letters long.
- We must avoid using C, R, A, E in any position.

We need to select a new guess that:
- Includes the letter N (because N is somewhere in the word).
- Does not include C, R, A, E (since they are confirmed absent).
- The letter N cannot be in the 4th position (because in ""CRANE"" it was in the 4th and got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but wrong position).

Possible positions for N: it can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

We also want to guess a word that covers new common letters to gain more information.

Available letters: We can use any letters except C, R, A, E. It's safe to avoid these.

Common letters to consider: T, O, I, S, H, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

We should aim for a word that includes N and other high-frequency letters not yet ruled out.

Since N is present, we can prioritize words that have N and also introduce vowels or consonants we haven't tested.

Vowels we can still use: O, I, U (since A and E are out).

Common consonants: T, S, L, etc.

A good candidate might include N and another vowel or two.

For example:
- Words like ""POINT"", but ""POINT"" has E? No, P,O,I,N,T – no E or A. But E is ruled out, so it's okay? Wait, no E, so good.
- However, we need to avoid C,R,A,E.

""POINT"": P,O,I,N,T – letters are P,O,I,N,T. None of C,R,A,E. And N is included.

But in ""POINT"", N is at position 4. But we know N cannot be in position 4? Wait, it can be in other positions? The feedback says N is in the word but not in position 4. So in a new word, N could be in position 1,2,3,5.

In ""POINT"", N is in position 4, but since the word has N in position 4, but the actual word has N not in position 4? The feedback doesn't say that N can't be in position 4 in general, only that in the secret word, N is not in position 4. So for our guess, we can place N in position 4 again, but that is still wrong, so it might give ""-"" again if N is elsewhere. But we know for sure that N is not at position 4 in the secret word.

Therefore, in our new guess, to gain more information, it's better to place N in a different position: positions 1,2,3, or 5.

But we don't know which, so perhaps try N in another position.

Also, we want to test other letters.

So, a word with N not in the 4th position and avoiding C,R,A,E.

Possible words:
- Option: ""SNOWY"" – S,N,O,W,Y. N is in position 2. Avoided C,R,A,E? R is ruled out, but S,N,O,W,Y are all different.
- Or ""UNITY"" – U,N,I,T,Y. N at position 2. Avoids C,R,A,E.

But ""SNOWY"" has Y, which is less common.

Better to use more common letters: T, O, I, S, etc.

Another word: ""TONIC"" – T,O,N,I,C. But C is ruled out! Cannot use C.

Avoid C.

So ""TONIC"" is invalid.

Perhaps ""POINT"" but with N not at 4: isn't that fixed? We need a word with N not at 4? No, we can use any position, but N not at 4 in the secret.

For guessing, we can place N anywhere, but it might be more informative to put it in a position we haven't tested yet.

Since position 4 is ruled out, we can test, say position 1 or 2.

For example, ""NOSEY"" – N,O,S,E,Y. But E is ruled out! Cannot use E.

We must avoid E.

So words without E or A,C,R.

List possible vowels: O, I, U, Y (sometimes), but Y is consonant too.

Common words without E or A: for example, ""POUND"", ""MOUND"", etc.

""POUND"": P,O,U,N,D. N at position 4? Position 4 is N? But N cannot be at position 4 in the secret word? In ""POUND"", N is at 4, but we suspect it's wrong because in ""CRANE"" N at 4 got ""-"", meaning it exists but elsewhere. So if we put N at 4 again, and if it's not in secret at 4, we get ""-"", but we already know that. Waste of a position.

Better to put N at a new position to test it.

So positions available: 1,2,3,5.

Perhaps put N at position 1 or 5.

Try ""NIGHT"": N,I,G,H,T. N at position 1. Avoids C,R,A,E? I, G, H, T – yes.

""NIFTY"": N,I,F,T,Y – also possible.

But ""OUIJA"" is a word but not common; avoid.

""INPUT"": I,N,P,U,T – N at position 2.

""MINTS"": M,I,N,T,S – N at position 3.

To cover multiple new letters: select a word with O, I, U and consonants like T,S,L.

Avoid C,R,A,E.

""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T – no N? But we must include N because we know it's in the word.

We must include N, otherwise if N isn't in the guess, we won't get info if there are other positions.

If we don't put N, we might miss confirming its position or presence.

No, since we know N is present, we should include it to find its position.

In this guess, include N in a new position.

Also, introduce other common letters not used or ruled out.

Letters not tried: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z but avoid C,R,A,E specifically.

Most common available: S, T, O, I, L, U, etc.

A good word with N and these.

Possible candidate: ""POINT"" but N at 4, which might not be optimal for position testing.

""JOINT"": J,O,I,N,T – J is less common.

Better: ""UNLIT"" – U,N,L,I,T. N at position 2.

Or ""SNAIL"" but A is ruled out. Cannot.

Since A and E are out, words with O, I, U vowels.

Another idea: ""THINK"" – T,H,I,N,K. N at position 4? Position 4 is N.

Position: in ""THINK"", positions: 1-T,2-H,3-I,4-N,5-K.

N at 4, same issue.

""STINK"": S,T,I,N,K – N at 4.

Many words have N at 4.

To avoid position 4, try words like ""SNOUT"" – S,N,O,U,T. N at 2.

""CLING"" but C is out.

""BLUNT"": B,L,U,N,T. N at 4? Positions:1-B,2-L,3-U,4-N,5-T. N at 4 again.

""NUDGE"" has E, out.

""DOWNY"" – D,O,W,N,Y. N at 4? Positions: 1-D,2-O,3-W,4-N,5-Y. N at 4.

It's hard to find words with N not at 4.

Position N at 1: ""NOISE"" – has E, out.

""NAIVE"" – A and E out.

""NOMAD"" – A out.

""NOTCH"" – C out? C is ruled out.

""NYMPH"" – N,Y,M,P,H.

""NYMPH"" is a word: N at position 1.

Letters: N,Y,M,P,H – all permissible? Y,M,P,H are allowed, since C,R,A,E are the only rules.

H not ruled out.

Similarly, ""LYMPH"" is also a word, but L,Y,M,P,H.

But ""NYMPH"" is better.

Or ""NIGHT"" as I thought.

But ""NYMPH"" might be obscure.

Better common words: ""KNOWN"" – has repeated N? Positions: K,N,O,W,N – N at positions 2 and 5? Repeated letters? But ""KNOWN"" has double N, but we don't know if secret has repeated letters, but usually it's better to avoid repeats for information.

Assume no repeats for now.

""TIMID"" – no N.

""POUND"" – N at 4.

""MOUNT"" – M,O,U,N,T – N at 4.

Why not place N at position 3 or 5?

For example, ""BANJO"" but A out.

""PINKO"" – P,I,N,K,O – N at position 3.

Letters P,I,N,K,O – all allowed? O is vowel, P,I,K,O and N.

P,I,N,K,O: no C,R,A,E.

K might be less common, but possible.

Another word: ""LINGO"" – L,I,N,G,O – N at 3? Positions: L,I,N,G,O – N position 3.

Good.

""MINTO"" might not be common.

""STUNG"" – S,T,U,N,G – N at 4? Positions: S,T,U,N,G – N position 4.

Always at 4 or repeated.

""USING"" – U,S,I,N,G – N at 4.

Perhaps ""HINGE"" has E, out.

To have N at 5: words ending with N, like ""WINN"" not 5 letters; ""BEGIN"" has E? B,E,G,I,N – E is ruled out.

""ROBIN"" has R, ruled out.

""SPAIN"" has A and S,P,I,N but A out.

""BRAIN"" has B,R,A,I,N – R and A out.

So hard to find words with N at end without A or E.

""GIVEN"" has E.

""OXBOW"" no N.

""CUMIN"" has C and U,M,I,N – C ruled out.

""TUMID"" – no E or A? T,U,M,I,D – no N.

Perhaps ""UNPIN"" – U,N,P,I,N – repeated N, not ideal.

Another word: ""QUINT"" – Q,U,I,N,T – Q less common.

But valid.

Perhaps ""POINT"" but N at 4, we can use it, and since we know N not at 4, we place it at 4 and get ""-"" again, but we also test other letters.

To save a turn and gain more info, it's better to move N.

Ideal: ""SNAKY"" – S,N,A,K,Y but A out.

""DOING"" – D,O,I,N,G – N at 4.

Positions: 1-D,2-O,3-I,4-N,5-G. N at 4.

But we can accept N at a different position? Like position 1 or 2 etc.

For example, ""KNIFE"" has E and F.

""WHINE"" has E.

""SHINY"" – S,H,I,N,Y – N at 4? Positions: S,H,I,N,Y – N position 4.

List words with N not at position 4.

- Position 1: ""NOISY"" but O,I,S,Y – N at 1? ""NOISY"" has S and Y, but letters N,O,I,S,Y – O and I vowels. But position: N at 1.

""NOISY"" is valid.

""NUTSY"" not common.

""NEWSY"" has E? N,E,W,S,Y – E ruled out.

""NOXIOUS"" too long.

""NASTY"" has S,T,Y but A out.

""NADIR"" has A and R out.

""NEIGH"" has E.

So ""NOISY"": N,O,I,S,Y – N at position 1.

No C,R,E,A.

Yes.

Similarly, ""NOUNS"" – N,O,U,N,S – N at 1 and 4, repeated.

Bad.

""LOINS"" – L,O,I,N,S – N at position 4.

So ""NOISY"" seems okay.

"" TIMID"" no N.

Another option: ""UNITY"" – U,N,I,T,Y – N at position 2.

U and I vowels.

""UNIFY"" also valid, U,N,I,F,Y.

Or ""ONION"" repeated O.

Avoid.

So ""UNITY"" or ""NOISY"".

""NOISY"" has S and Y, ""UNITY"" has T and Y.

Both include Y, which might be less common.

But permissible.

Perhaps ""MOUNT"" but N at 4.

I think ""NOISY"" or ""UNITY"" are fine.

To prioritize common letters, ""STOIC"" has C? No, C out.

""POINTS"" too long.

Five-letter word.

Another common word without E/A: ""PILOT"" but no N.

Must include N.

So I'll go with ""UNITY"": U,N,I,T,Y – letters U, N, I, T, Y.

N is at position 2.

Feedback will tell us if N is at position 2 or not.

Also test U, I, T, Y.

If U, I, T, Y are present or not.

But since no C,R,A,E, it's safe.

""UNITY"" might be a good choice.

To avoid Y, use another word.

""INPUT"": I,N,P,U,T – N at 2.

Similarly, P is less common than T in ""UNITY"".

But T is more frequent.

T frequency 9.28%, P is 2.03%, so ""UNITY"" with T is better than ""INPUT"" with P.

""UNITY"" has U,N,I,T,Y.

Y frequency is about 1.66%, low.

""UNTIL"" – U,N,T,I,L – L is common.

""UNTIL"" : U,N,T,I,L – positions:1-U,2-N,3-T,4-I,5-L. N at 2.

L is better than Y.

Letters U,N,T,I,L.

Frequency: U=3.10%, N=7.23%, T=9.28%, I=7.57%, L=4.07%. Better than Y.

And avoid C,R,A,E.

""UNTIL"" is a valid English word.

Perfect.

Similarly, ""LINED"" has E.

So ""UNTIL"" is better.

Therefore, choose ""UNTIL"".Based on the previous feedback for ""CRANE"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x), we know:
- Letters C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.
- The letter N **is** in the word, but not in the 4th position (since it received ""-"" in position 4 of ""CRANE"").

For the new guess:
- Must include the letter N (as it is present) but not in the 4th position.
- Avoid using C, R, A, E entirely.
- Should cover new common letters to maximize information gain. Prioritizing high-frequency letters like T, I, U, L, O, S, etc., while ensuring the word is valid and has no repeated letters for better coverage.

After evaluating options:
- Chose ""UNTIL"" because:
  - It includes N in position 2 (a new position to test).
  - Contains other common letters: U, T, I, L (all untested and high-frequency).
  - No ruled-out letters (C, R, A, E), and all letters are distinct.
  - Helps test vowels U/I and consonants T/L.

This guess should provide valuable feedback to narrow down the secret word.

<thinking>
- Summary of previous feedback: Only N is present (wrong position), C/R/A/E absent.
- Goal: Guess a 5-letter word including N, not in position 4, avoiding C/R/A/E.
- Selected ""UNTIL"" because:
  - N is in position 2 (testing a new position).
  - Uses high-frequency untested letters U, T, I, L.
  - Vali English word with distinct letters for maximum information.
- Expected to gain feedback on N's position and presence of U/T/I/L.

Since it\'s the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with. I need to choose a good starting word.\n\nA common strategy in word games like Wordle is to pick a word that includes frequently used letters to maximize the information gained. Vowels and common consonants are often good choices.\n\nLooking at English letter frequency, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. For Wordle, words with multiple vowels or a balance of vowels and consonants are preferred.\n\nSome popular starting words are:\n\n- ""CRANE"": Includes C, R, A, N, E – covering common consonants and vowels.\n\n- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – also good coverage.\n\n- ""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T – similar.\n\nI should choose a word that has:\n\n- At least two or three vowels.\n\n- Common consonants.\n\n- No repeating letters, if possible, to cover more ground.\n\n""CRANE"" seems solid: C, R, A, N, E – all fairly common letters, and it has three vowels (A, E) if we consider Y sometimes, but here it\'s A and E.\n\nVowels: A and E are vowels, C, R, N are consonants.\n\n""A"" and ""E"" are vowels, ""C"", ""R"", ""N"" are consonants.\n\nPerhaps I should pick a word with more vowels. ""ADIEU"" is another popular starter because it has four vowels: A, I, E, U.\n\nBut ""ADIEU"" has D, which is common, but might not be ideal if I want utility consonants.\n\nIn Wordle, vowels are crucial because they appear in many words.\n\nSince this is the first guess, my goal is to get as much information as possible, not necessarily to guess the word right away.\n\nAfter this guess, I\'ll get feedback, which I can use for subsequent guesses.\n\nFor rule compliance: my guess must be a valid 5-letter English word.\n\nI need to ensure that the word I pick is valid.\n\n""CRANE"" is definitely a valid word.\n\n""SLATE"" is fine too.\n\nI\'ll go with ""CRANE"" for a balanced approach.\n\n""SOARE"" is sometimes used, but ""SOARE"" might be less common; ""CRANE"" is better known.\n\nAnother one is ""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E – which has three vowels: A, I, E, and common consonants.\n\nSimilarly, ""ROATE"" or ""CRATE"".\n\nBut ""CRANE"" is similar.\n\nTo maximize letter coverage, ""CRANE"" has five distinct letters: C, R, A, N, E.\n\nE is a vowel, A is a vowel.\n\nIn terms of frequency, E, A, R are top letters.\n\nE is the most common letter, A is second or third, depending on source.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia: E, T, A, O, I, N are the top letters.\n\n""CRANE"" has E, A, but not T? C is less common than T.\n\n""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E – S is common, L is common, A, T, E are top.\n\nT is more common than C.\n\nLetter frequencies: E 12.49%, T 9.28%, A 8.04%, O 7.64%, I 7.57%, N 7.23%, S 6.51%, R 6.28%, H 5.05%, L 4.07%, etc.\n\n""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – S=6.51%, L=4.07%, A=8.04%, T=9.28%, E=12.49%.

C is less frequent.\n\nPerhaps ""ALERT"": A, L, E, R, T – A=8.04%, L=4.07%, E=12.49%, R=6.28%, T=9.28%.\n\nOr ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E – I=7.57%, R=6.28%, A=8.04%, T=9.28%, E=12.49%. ""IRATE"" seems good as it has five of the top seven letters if we consider I and E.\n\nE, T, A, I, N are top five after E, but N is missing.\n\n""RAISE"": R=6.28%, A=8.04%, I=7.57%, S=6.51%, E=12.49%. All high-frequency.\n\nI think ""RAISE"" or ""SLATE"" would be fine.\n\nBut I recall that in Wordle, starting words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are often recommended.\n\nSince the user didn\'t specify a word list, I\'ll assume any valid English word.\n\nTo be safe, I\'ll go with ""CRANE"".\n\nAnother popular choice is ""SOARE"", which is a word meaning a young hawk, but it might be obscure; better to use common words.\n\n""ADIEU"" has A, D, I, E, U – D is common, U is vowel, but D frequency is 3.82%, which is fine.\n\nBut ""ADIEU"" focuses on vowels, which might leave consonants uncovered.\n\nI think ""CRANE"" is a good choice for a broad coverage.\n\nI\'ll use ""CRANE"" as the first guess.\n\nFor the response, I need to provide my thought process within <thinking></thinking> tags, and then the guess in <guess></guess> tags.\n\nSpecifically:\n```xml\n<thinking>\n[step-by-step thought here]\n</thinking>\n<guess>CRANE</guess>\n```\n\nIn the thought process, I should reason step by step.\n\nThought process:\n- For the first guess, no prior information.\n- Aim to maximize information by choosing a word with high-frequency letters.\n- Selected ""CRANE"" because it contains common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E), all distinct, to cover a wide range.\n\nMake it concise but clear.<thinking>\nFor the first guess in this word guessing game, I have no prior feedback or information about the secret word.

But in reality, this is the first interaction. So I need to make the first valid guess.\n\nThe feedback says: ""Model answer is not five letters."" meaning that in a previous attempt, the model\'s answer was not five letters. But since this is the start, I should provide a five-letter word.\n\nI think the user is setting up a scenario where my first attempt was invalid, so now I must provide a new first guess that is five letters.\n\nTherefore, I should proceed to make a valid five-letter word guess.\n\nI\'ll use the same reasoning as before and choose ""CRANE"".\n\nBut to be thorough, let me think again.\n\nFirst guess: I need a valid 5-letter English word.\n\nI choose ""CRANE"" for the reasons stated.\n\nSo, my response should be:\n\n<thinking>\nI see that a previous guess was invalid because it was not five letters.

The letter N is present in the word, but not in the 4th position (since ""CRANE"" has N as the 4th letter).\n2. The letters C, R, A, E are absent from the word.\n3. Since only N is present, the word must contain N.\n\nAdditional constraints:\n- The word is 5 letters long.\n- We must avoid using C, R, A, E in any position.\n\nWe need to select a new guess that:\n- Includes the letter N (because N is somewhere in the word).\n- Does not include C, R, A, E (since they are confirmed absent).\n- The letter N cannot be in the 4th position (because in ""CRANE"" it was in the 4th and got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but wrong position).\n\nPossible positions for N: it can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).\n\nWe also want to guess a word that covers new common letters to gain more information.\n\nAvailable letters: We can use any letters except C, R, A, E. It\'s safe to avoid these.\n\nCommon letters to consider: T, O, I, S, H, L, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\nWe should aim for a word that includes N and other high-frequency letters not yet ruled out.\n\nSince N is present, we can prioritize words that have N and also introduce vowels or consonants we haven\'t tested.\n\nVowels we can still use: O, I, U (since A and E are out).\n\nCommon consonants: T, S, L, etc.\n\nA good candidate might include N and another vowel or two.\n\nFor example:\n- Words like ""POINT"", but ""POINT"" has E? No, P,O,I,N,T – no E or A. But E is ruled out, so it\'s okay? Wait, no E, so good.\n- However, we need to avoid C,R,A,E.\n\n""POINT"": P,O,I,N,T – letters are P,O,I,N,T. None of C,R,A,E. And N is included.\n\nBut in ""POINT"", N is at position 4. But we know N cannot be in position 4? Wait, it can be in other positions? The feedback says N is in the word but not in position 4. So in a new word, N could be in position 1,2,3,5.\n\nIn ""POINT"", N is in position 4, but since the word has N in position 4, but the actual word has N not in position 4? The feedback doesn\'t say that N can\'t be in position 4 in general, only that in the secret word, N is not in position 4. So for our guess, we can place N in position 4 again, but that is still wrong, so it might give ""-"" again if N is elsewhere. But we know for sure that N is not at position 4 in the secret word.\n\nTherefore, in our new guess, to gain more information, it\'s better to place N in a different position: positions 1,2,3, or 5.\n\nBut we don\'t know which, so perhaps try N in another position.\n\nAlso, we want to test other letters.\n\nSo, a word with N not in the 4th position and avoiding C,R,A,E.\n\nPossible words:\n- Option: ""SNOWY"" – S,N,O,W,Y. N is in position 2. Avoided C,R,A,E? R is ruled out, but S,N,O,W,Y are all different.\n- Or ""UNITY"" – U,N,I,T,Y. N at position 2. Avoids C,R,A,E.\n\nBut ""SNOWY"" has Y, which is less common.\n\nBetter to use more common letters: T, O, I, S, etc.\n\nAnother word: ""TONIC"" – T,O,N,I,C. But C is ruled out! Cannot use C.\n\nAvoid C.\n\nSo ""TONIC"" is invalid.\n\nPerhaps ""POINT"" but with N not at 4: isn\'t that fixed? We need a word with N not at 4? No, we can use any position, but N not at 4 in the secret.\n\nFor guessing, we can place N anywhere, but it might be more informative to put it in a position we haven\'t tested yet.\n\nSince position 4 is ruled out, we can test, say position 1 or 2.\n\nFor example, ""NOSEY"" – N,O,S,E,Y. But E is ruled out! Cannot use E.\n\nWe must avoid E.\n\nSo words without E or A,C,R.\n\nList possible vowels: O, I, U, Y (sometimes), but Y is consonant too.\n\nCommon words without E or A: for example, ""POUND"", ""MOUND"", etc.\n\n""POUND"": P,O,U,N,D. N at position 4? Position 4 is N? But N cannot be at position 4 in the secret word? In ""POUND"", N is at 4, but we suspect it\'s wrong because in ""CRANE"" N at 4 got ""-"", meaning it exists but elsewhere. So if we put N at 4 again, and if it\'s not in secret at 4, we get ""-"", but we already know that. Waste of a position.\n\nBetter to put N at a new position to test it.\n\nSo positions available: 1,2,3,5.\n\nPerhaps put N at position 1 or 5.\n\nTry ""NIGHT"": N,I,G,H,T. N at position 1. Avoids C,R,A,E? I, G, H, T – yes.\n\n""NIFTY"": N,I,F,T,Y – also possible.\n\nBut ""OUIJA"" is a word but not common; avoid.\n\n""INPUT"": I,N,P,U,T – N at position 2.\n\n""MINTS"": M,I,N,T,S – N at position 3.\n\nTo cover multiple new letters: select a word with O, I, U and consonants like T,S,L.\n\nAvoid C,R,A,E.\n\n""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T – no N? But we must include N because we know it\'s in the word.\n\nWe must include N, otherwise if N isn\'t in the guess, we won\'t get info if there are other positions.\n\nIf we don\'t put N, we might miss confirming its position or presence.\n\nNo, since we know N is present, we should include it to find its position.\n\nIn this guess, include N in a new position.\n\nAlso, introduce other common letters not used or ruled out.\n\nLetters not tried: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z but avoid C,R,A,E specifically.\n\nMost common available: S, T, O, I, L, U, etc.\n\nA good word with N and these.\n\nPossible candidate: ""POINT"" but N at 4, which might not be optimal for position testing.\n\n""JOINT"": J,O,I,N,T – J is less common.\n\nBetter: ""UNLIT"" – U,N,L,I,T. N at position 2.\n\nOr ""SNAIL"" but A is ruled out. Cannot.\n\nSince A and E are out, words with O, I, U vowels.\n\nAnother idea: ""THINK"" – T,H,I,N,K. N at position 4? Position 4 is N.\n\nPosition: in ""THINK"", positions: 1-T,2-H,3-I,4-N,5-K.\n\nN at 4, same issue.\n\n""STINK"": S,T,I,N,K – N at 4.\n\nMany words have N at 4.\n\nTo avoid position 4, try words like ""SNOUT"" – S,N,O,U,T.

C is ruled out.\n\n""NYMPH"" – N,Y,M,P,H.\n\n""NYMPH"" is a word: N at position 1.\n\nLetters: N,Y,M,P,H – all permissible? Y,M,P,H are allowed, since C,R,A,E are the only rules.\n\nH not ruled out.\n\nSimilarly, ""LYMPH"" is also a word, but L,Y,M,P,H.\n\nBut ""NYMPH"" is better.\n\nOr ""NIGHT"" as I thought.\n\nBut ""NYMPH"" might be obscure.\n\nBetter common words: ""KNOWN"" – has repeated N? Positions: K,N,O,W,N – N at positions 2 and 5? Repeated letters? But ""KNOWN"" has double N, but we don\'t know if secret has repeated letters, but usually it\'s better to avoid repeats for information.\n\nAssume no repeats for now.\n\n""TIMID"" – no N.\n\n""POUND"" – N at 4.\n\n""MOUNT"" – M,O,U,N,T – N at 4.\n\nWhy not place N at position 3 or 5?\n\nFor example, ""BANJO"" but A out.\n\n""PINKO"" – P,I,N,K,O – N at position 3.\n\nLetters P,I,N,K,O – all allowed? O is vowel, P,I,K,O and N.\n\nP,I,N,K,O: no C,R,A,E.\n\nK might be less common, but possible.\n\nAnother word: ""LINGO"" – L,I,N,G,O – N at 3?

Positions: S,H,I,N,Y – N position 4.\n\nList words with N not at position 4.\n\n- Position 1: ""NOISY"" but O,I,S,Y – N at 1? ""NOISY"" has S and Y, but letters N,O,I,S,Y – O and I vowels.

We have the following feedback history:
- Guess 1: Invalid (not five letters) – no useful info.
- Guess 2: ""CRANE"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x) → So N is in the word but not in position 4; C, R, A, E are absent.
- Guess 3: ""UNTIL"" → U(x), N(-), T(x), I(x), L(-) → This means:
  - U is absent (x)
  - N is present but not in position 2 (since it got - for position 2)
  - T is absent (x)
  - I is absent (x)
  - L is present but not in position 5 (since it got - for position 5)

From all feedback so far:
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, U, T, I (so we must avoid these)
- Present letters: N and L (both are in the word but not in their guessed positions)
  - N is not in position 2 or 4 (from guesses 2 and 3)
  - L is not in position 5 (from guess 3)

We also know the word has 5 letters.

Now, since N and L are present, and we have two positions ruled out for N (2 and 4) and one for L (5), we need to find a word that:
- Includes both N and L (since they are confirmed present)
- Avoids C, R, A, E, U, T, I
- Places N not in positions 2 or 4
- Places L not in position 5

Possible positions for N: 1, 3, or 5 (since 2 and 4 are ruled out)
Possible positions for L: 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since 5 is ruled out)

We also need to introduce new letters to gain more information. The remaining letters to test should be from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, S, V, W, Y, etc.

Common letters among these: O, S, H, D, M, P, etc.

We should aim for a word that has N and L in allowed positions and uses common unused letters.

Let's consider possible positions:

Option 1: N at position 1, L at position 3 (for example). Then we need to fill other positions.

But we don't know, so we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities.

Since we have limited vowels left (O is the main vowel available, as A, E, I, U are out), we should include O if possible.

Vowels available: O, and sometimes Y.

Consonants: S, H, D, M, P, etc.

A good candidate word: ""LOINS"" but L is at position 1, and we have L present, but we don't know if it can be at 1? We only know it's not at 5, so it can be at 1.

But ""LOINS"" has I and S? I is absent, so cannot use I.

Avoid I.

Similarly, ""LONGS"" – L,O,N,G,S. Positions: L at 1, O at 2, N at 3, G at 4, S at 5.

Now, check:
- L at position 1: allowed? We only know L not at 5, so position 1 is possible.
- N at position 3: allowed? We know N not at 2 or 4, so position 3 is allowed.

Letters: L, O, N, G, S – all not in the absent list? Absent: C,R,A,E,U,T,I. So O, G, S are allowed.

But we have to check if G and S are available.

Yes.

However, we have two present letters: L and N, and we are placing them in new positions.

Also, we introduce O, G, S.

But ""LONGS"" is a word? It can be a verb meaning longs for, or plural of long? But in word games, it's often accepted.

To be safe, another word: ""BOLDS"" – but B,O,L,D,S. L at 3? Positions: B,O,L,D,S – L at 3. But we need to include N? We must include N because it's present.

We cannot omit N.

So the word must have both L and N.

Another word: ""SLUNG"" but S,L,U,N,G – U is absent, so no.

""PLANK"" has A, absent.

""CLANK"" has C and A.

""FLING"" has I, absent.

""BLOWN"" – B,L,O,W,N. Positions: B at 1, L at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5.

Now, check positions:
- L at position 2: we don't have any feedback on L at 2, so it's allowed (we only know not at 5).
- N at position 5: we know N not at 2 or 4, but position 5 is allowed? Yes, because we only ruled out 2 and 4 for N.

So N can be at 5.

Similarly, L at 2 is allowed.

Letters: B, L, O, W, N – all not in absent list? B, O, W, N, L. Absent letters: C,R,A,E,U,T,I. So B, O, W are new and allowed.

""BLOWN"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""GROWN"" has R, absent.

""SHOWN"" – S,H,O,W,N. Positions: S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5.

N at 5, which is allowed.

But L is not included? We must include L because it is present.

We cannot omit L. Both N and L must be in the word.

So ""SHOWN"" has no L, so it would be invalid because L is missing.

Similarly, any guess must include both N and L.

So back to ""BLOWN"": it has L and N.

L at position 2, N at position 5.

We can also consider ""OWNS"" too short.

""SLOW"" too short.

""NOBLY"" – N,O,B,L,Y. Positions: N at 1, O at 2, B at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.

Now, N at 1: allowed (not 2 or 4).
L at 4: allowed (we only know not at 5, so 4 is fine).

Letters: N, O, B, L, Y – all allowed.

""NOBLY"" is an adverb, meaning in a noble manner.

Similarly, ""NOBLY"" might be acceptable.

But Y is less common.

""POLED"" has E, absent.

""SOLID"" has I and O, but I absent.

""SOLID"" not allowed.

""MOULD"" has U, absent.

""GOLD"" too short.

Another word: ""BONUS"" – B,O,N,U,S. U is absent, so no.

""SONIC"" has C and I, absent.

So ""BLOWN"" and ""NOBLY"" are candidates.

""BLOWN"" has W, which is less common, but okay.

""LOVES"" has E and O, but E absent.

""PONDS"" – P,O,N,D,S. But no L? Must have L.

So not.

""LANDS"" has A, absent.

""BONDS"" – B,O,N,D,S. No L.

So must include L.

""BLOND"" – B,L,O,N,D. Positions: B at 1, L at 2, O at 3, N at 4, D at 5.

But N at position 4: we know N cannot be at position 4 (from guess 2). So this is invalid for the guess because we know N is not at 4, so we shouldn't place it there.

Similarly, in ""BLOWN"", N is at 5, which is okay.

In ""NOBLY"", N at 1 and L at 4, both allowed positions.

""NOBLY"" has L at 4, which is allowed since we only know L not at 5.

Similarly, ""BLOWN"" has L at 2 and N at 5.

Now, which one to choose? Both are valid.

""BLOWN"" introduces B, O, W.

""NOBLY"" introduces O, B, Y.

W is less common than Y? W frequency 1.83%, Y 1.66%, similar.

But O and B are common.

Perhaps ""BLOWN"" is more common.

Another word: ""FLOWN"" has F,L,O,W,N. But F is allowed? Absent letters don't include F. F is 1.96% frequency.

""FLOWN"" positions: F at 1, L at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5.

L at 2, N at 5, both allowed.

But we have F and W, which are less common.

""BLOWN"" is better with B.

But B is also less common (1.49%).

Perhaps a word with S or H.

""SLOWN"" not a word.

""SHOWN"" no L.

""SNOWL"" not a word.

""LOVNS"" not.

So I think ""BLOWN"" or ""NOBLY"".

Let's choose ""BLOWN"" for now.

But we can also consider ""LOWNS"" not a word.

""KNOWL"" not.

Another one: ""OWLED"" has E.

So I'll go with ""BLOWN"".

But in ""BLOWN"", L is at position 2. We don't know if L can be at 2, but it's possible.

Similarly, N at 5.

We also test B, O, W.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

But we have to include L and N.

Another candidate: ""POLYP"" has O,L,Y,P but no N.

""NYLON"" – N,Y,L,O,N – repeated N? Positions: N at 1, Y at 2, L at 3, O at 4, N at 5. Repeated N, and N at 1 and 5. But we know N is present, but it might be repeated? But in word games, words can have repeated letters, but for guessing, it's better to avoid to test more letters.

But ""NYLON"" has N at 1 and 5, but we don't know if it's repeated. Also, position 4 is O, which is new.

But repeated N might not be efficient.

Stick with distinct letters.

""NOBLY"" has distinct: N,O,B,L,Y.

""BLOWN"" has distinct: B,L,O,W,N.

""BLOWN"" has W, which is less common, but okay.

Perhaps ""BOWLN"" not a word.

I think both are fine.

Let's choose ""BLOWN"".

But we have another option: ""GONAD"" has A and D, but A absent.

""BONED"" has E.

""CONED"" has C and E.

So no.

""LOVES"" has E.

""DOZEN"" has E and O, but E absent.

So I think ""BLOWN"" is acceptable.

But let's confirm the feedback for L: in ""UNTIL"", L was at position 5 and got ""-"", meaning L is in the word but not at position 5. So in ""BLOWN"", L is at position 2, which is a new position, so it could be correct or not.

Similarly for N at 5.

Now, we need to make a guess.

Perhaps a word with S, which is common.

""SLING"" has I and L, but I absent.

""SONLY"" not a word.

""SNOWY"" – S,N,O,W,Y. But no L? Must have L.

So not.

""SLOWY"" not.

""LOVES"" no.

""BLESS"" has E and S, but E absent.

So hard to include S without forbidden vowels.

""POSH"" too short.

""PLUSH"" has U and H, but U absent.

So ""BLOWN"" seems a reasonable choice.

I'll go with ""BLOWN"".

But in ""BLOWN"", we have W, which might not be ideal, but it's okay.

Another word: ""BOWEL"" has E and W, E absent.

""FOWLS"" – F,O,W,L,S. Positions: F at 1, O at 2, W at 3, L at 4, S at 5.

L at position 4: allowed (not 5).

But N is not included? Must include N.

So no.

""OWLETS"" too long.

So I think ""BLOWN"" is fine.

Perhaps ""NOBLE"" but E absent.

So ""BLOWN"" it is.

But let's see if there's a word with O and S.

""SOLID"" has I.

""SOLAR"" has A and R.

""SOLES"" has E.

""SONGS"" – S,O,N,G,S – repeated S, and no L.

Must have L.

""LONGS"" – L,O,N,G,S. Positions: L at 1, O at 2, N at 3, G at 4, S at 5.

Now, L at 1: allowed (not 5).
N at 3: allowed (not 2 or 4).

Letters: L, O, N, G, S – all allowed, no absent letters.

""LONGS"" is a valid word, meaning long pants or a verb form.

It might be accepted.

And it has S, which is common.

So ""LONGS"" might be better than ""BLOWN"" because it has S and G instead of B and W.

G frequency 1.87%, S 6.51%, O 7.64%, L 4.07%, N 7.23%.

S is more common than W or B.

So ""LONGS"" is a good choice.

Similarly, we test L at position 1 and N at position 3.

Both new positions.

So I'll go with ""LONGS"".

<thinking>
From previous feedback:
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, U, T, I
- Present letters: N (not in pos 2 or 4) and L (not in pos 5)
- Must include both N and L in the new guess, avoiding absent letters and placing N not in 2/4 and L not in 5.

Chose ""LONGS"" because:
- L is in position 1 (new position, not 5)
- N is in position 3 (new position, not 2 or 4)
- Uses new common letters: O, G, S (S is high-frequency)
- Valid English word with distinct letters.

This tests:
- If L is in position 1
- If N is in position 3
- Presence of O, G, S

Feedback will help narrow down the possibilities significantly.
</thinking>

<guess>LONGS</guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

<thinking>
1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 2 (CRANE):** C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)  
     - This means:  
       - C, R, A, E are **absent** from the secret word.  
       - N is **present** but not in position 4 (since it got ""-"" for position 4).  
   - **Guess 3 (UNTIL):** U(x), N(-), T(x), I(x), L(-)  
     - This means:  
       - U, T, I are **absent** from the secret word.  
       - N is **present** but not in position 2 (new information, as it was already known to not be in position 4).  
       - L is **present** but not in position 5 (since it got ""-"" for position 5).  

2. **Summary of Known Information:**
   - **Absent Letters:** C, R, A, E, U, T, I (cannot be used in new guesses).  
   - **Present Letters:**  
     - N: Must be in the word but not in positions 2 or 4. Possible positions: 1, 3, or 5.  
     - L: Must be in the word but not in position 5. Possible positions: 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
   - **Word Length:** 5 letters.  
   - **Constraints:**  
     - The new guess must include both N and L (since they are confirmed present).  
     - Avoid all absent letters (C, R, A, E, U, T, I).  
     - N cannot be placed in positions 2 or 4.  
     - L cannot be placed in position 5.  

3. **Strategy for New Guess:**
   - **Goal:** Maximize information by testing new high-frequency letters and narrowing positions for N and L.  
   - **Available Letters:** Focus on unused, common English letters: O, S, H, D, M, P, B, G, W, Y, etc. (since C, R, A, E, U, T, I are ruled out).  
   - **Letter Frequency Priority:** S (6.51%), O (7.64%), L (4.07%), N (7.23%), H (5.05%), D (3.82%) — based on English letter frequency.  
   - **Position Testing:**  
     - Place N in a new untested position (1, 3, or 5) to gather more data.  
     - Place L in a new untested position (1, 2, 3, or 4) to gather more data.  
   - **Avoid Repeats:** Use distinct letters to cover more ground.  

4. **Candidate Word Selection:**
   - **Options Considered:**  
     - **BLOWN:** B, L, O, W, N. L in position 2 (allowed), N in position 5 (allowed). Tests B, O, W.  
     - **NOBLY:** N, O, B, L, Y. N in position 1 (allowed), L in position 4 (allowed). Tests O, B, Y.  
     - **LONGS:** L, O, N, G, S. L in position 1 (allowed), N in position 3 (allowed). Tests O, G, S.  
   - **Why LONGS?**  
     - Includes both N and L in allowed positions: L at 1 (not 5) and N at 3 (not 2 or 4).  
     - Introduces high-frequency S (6.51%) and O (7.64%), plus G (1.87%) for broad coverage.  
     - All letters are distinct and not ruled out (no C, R, A, E, U, T, I).  
     - Valid English word (noun/verb, e.g., ""long pants"" or ""desires"").  
     - Tests key positions: If L is correct at position 1, or N at position 3, feedback will be very informative.  

5. **Expected Outcome:**  
   - Feedback on L at position 1 and N at position 3 will help confirm/correct their positions.  
   - New letters (O, G, S) will reveal if they are present/absent, further narrowing the word list.  
   - With only 6 tries, this guess efficiently uses known constraints to reduce possibilities.
</thinking>

<guess>LONGS</guess>",LONGS,"We have the following feedback history:
- Guess 1: Invalid (not five letters) – no useful info.
- Guess 2: ""CRANE"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x) → So N is in the word but not in position 4; C, R, A, E are absent.
- Guess 3: ""UNTIL"" → U(x), N(-), T(x), I(x), L(-) → This means:
  - U is absent (x)
  - N is present but not in position 2 (since it got - for position 2)
  - T is absent (x)
  - I is absent (x)
  - L is present but not in position 5 (since it got - for position 5)

From all feedback so far:
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, U, T, I (so we must avoid these)
- Present letters: N and L (both are in the word but not in their guessed positions)
  - N is not in position 2 or 4 (from guesses 2 and 3)
  - L is not in position 5 (from guess 3)

We also know the word has 5 letters.

Now, since N and L are present, and we have two positions ruled out for N (2 and 4) and one for L (5), we need to find a word that:
- Includes both N and L (since they are confirmed present)
- Avoids C, R, A, E, U, T, I
- Places N not in positions 2 or 4
- Places L not in position 5

Possible positions for N: 1, 3, or 5 (since 2 and 4 are ruled out)
Possible positions for L: 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since 5 is ruled out)

We also need to introduce new letters to gain more information. The remaining letters to test should be from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, S, V, W, Y, etc.

Common letters among these: O, S, H, D, M, P, etc.

We should aim for a word that has N and L in allowed positions and uses common unused letters.

Let's consider possible positions:

Option 1: N at position 1, L at position 3 (for example). Then we need to fill other positions.

But we don't know, so we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities.

Since we have limited vowels left (O is the main vowel available, as A, E, I, U are out), we should include O if possible.

Vowels available: O, and sometimes Y.

Consonants: S, H, D, M, P, etc.

A good candidate word: ""LOINS"" but L is at position 1, and we have L present, but we don't know if it can be at 1? We only know it's not at 5, so it can be at 1.

But ""LOINS"" has I and S? I is absent, so cannot use I.

Avoid I.

Similarly, ""LONGS"" – L,O,N,G,S. Positions: L at 1, O at 2, N at 3, G at 4, S at 5.

Now, check:
- L at position 1: allowed? We only know L not at 5, so position 1 is possible.
- N at position 3: allowed? We know N not at 2 or 4, so position 3 is allowed.

Letters: L, O, N, G, S – all not in the absent list? Absent: C,R,A,E,U,T,I. So O, G, S are allowed.

But we have to check if G and S are available.

Yes.

However, we have two present letters: L and N, and we are placing them in new positions.

Also, we introduce O, G, S.

But ""LONGS"" is a word? It can be a verb meaning longs for, or plural of long? But in word games, it's often accepted.

To be safe, another word: ""BOLDS"" – but B,O,L,D,S. L at 3? Positions: B,O,L,D,S – L at 3. But we need to include N? We must include N because it's present.

We cannot omit N.

So the word must have both L and N.

Another word: ""SLUNG"" but S,L,U,N,G – U is absent, so no.

""PLANK"" has A, absent.

""CLANK"" has C and A.

""FLING"" has I, absent.

""BLOWN"" – B,L,O,W,N. Positions: B at 1, L at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5.

Now, check positions:
- L at position 2: we don't have any feedback on L at 2, so it's allowed (we only know not at 5).
- N at position 5: we know N not at 2 or 4, but position 5 is allowed? Yes, because we only ruled out 2 and 4 for N.

So N can be at 5.

Similarly, L at 2 is allowed.

Letters: B, L, O, W, N – all not in absent list? B, O, W, N, L. Absent letters: C,R,A,E,U,T,I. So B, O, W are new and allowed.

""BLOWN"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""GROWN"" has R, absent.

""SHOWN"" – S,H,O,W,N. Positions: S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5.

N at 5, which is allowed.

But L is not included? We must include L because it is present.

We cannot omit L. Both N and L must be in the word.

So ""SHOWN"" has no L, so it would be invalid because L is missing.

Similarly, any guess must include both N and L.

So back to ""BLOWN"": it has L and N.

L at position 2, N at position 5.

We can also consider ""OWNS"" too short.

""SLOW"" too short.

""NOBLY"" – N,O,B,L,Y. Positions: N at 1, O at 2, B at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.

Now, N at 1: allowed (not 2 or 4).
L at 4: allowed (we only know not at 5, so 4 is fine).

Letters: N, O, B, L, Y – all allowed.

""NOBLY"" is an adverb, meaning in a noble manner.

Similarly, ""NOBLY"" might be acceptable.

But Y is less common.

""POLED"" has E, absent.

""SOLID"" has I and O, but I absent.

""SOLID"" not allowed.

""MOULD"" has U, absent.

""GOLD"" too short.

Another word: ""BONUS"" – B,O,N,U,S. U is absent, so no.

""SONIC"" has C and I, absent.

So ""BLOWN"" and ""NOBLY"" are candidates.

""BLOWN"" has W, which is less common, but okay.

""LOVES"" has E and O, but E absent.

""PONDS"" – P,O,N,D,S. But no L? Must have L.

So not.

""LANDS"" has A, absent.

""BONDS"" – B,O,N,D,S. No L.

So must include L.

""BLOND"" – B,L,O,N,D. Positions: B at 1, L at 2, O at 3, N at 4, D at 5.

But N at position 4: we know N cannot be at position 4 (from guess 2). So this is invalid for the guess because we know N is not at 4, so we shouldn't place it there.

Similarly, in ""BLOWN"", N is at 5, which is okay.

In ""NOBLY"", N at 1 and L at 4, both allowed positions.

""NOBLY"" has L at 4, which is allowed since we only know L not at 5.

Similarly, ""BLOWN"" has L at 2 and N at 5.

Now, which one to choose? Both are valid.

""BLOWN"" introduces B, O, W.

""NOBLY"" introduces O, B, Y.

W is less common than Y? W frequency 1.83%, Y 1.66%, similar.

But O and B are common.

Perhaps ""BLOWN"" is more common.

Another word: ""FLOWN"" has F,L,O,W,N. But F is allowed? Absent letters don't include F. F is 1.96% frequency.

""FLOWN"" positions: F at 1, L at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5.

L at 2, N at 5, both allowed.

But we have F and W, which are less common.

""BLOWN"" is better with B.

But B is also less common (1.49%).

Perhaps a word with S or H.

""SLOWN"" not a word.

""SHOWN"" no L.

""SNOWL"" not a word.

""LOVNS"" not.

So I think ""BLOWN"" or ""NOBLY"".

Let's choose ""BLOWN"" for now.

But we can also consider ""LOWNS"" not a word.

""KNOWL"" not.

Another one: ""OWLED"" has E.

So I'll go with ""BLOWN"".

But in ""BLOWN"", L is at position 2. We don't know if L can be at 2, but it's possible.

Similarly, N at 5.

We also test B, O, W.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

But we have to include L and N.

Another candidate: ""POLYP"" has O,L,Y,P but no N.

""NYLON"" – N,Y,L,O,N – repeated N? Positions: N at 1, Y at 2, L at 3, O at 4, N at 5. Repeated N, and N at 1 and 5. But we know N is present, but it might be repeated? But in word games, words can have repeated letters, but for guessing, it's better to avoid to test more letters.

But ""NYLON"" has N at 1 and 5, but we don't know if it's repeated. Also, position 4 is O, which is new.

But repeated N might not be efficient.

Stick with distinct letters.

""NOBLY"" has distinct: N,O,B,L,Y.

""BLOWN"" has distinct: B,L,O,W,N.

""BLOWN"" has W, which is less common, but okay.

Perhaps ""BOWLN"" not a word.

I think both are fine.

Let's choose ""BLOWN"".

But we have another option: ""GONAD"" has A and D, but A absent.

""BONED"" has E.

""CONED"" has C and E.

So no.

""LOVES"" has E.

""DOZEN"" has E and O, but E absent.

So I think ""BLOWN"" is acceptable.

But let's confirm the feedback for L: in ""UNTIL"", L was at position 5 and got ""-"", meaning L is in the word but not at position 5. So in ""BLOWN"", L is at position 2, which is a new position, so it could be correct or not.

Similarly for N at 5.

Now, we need to make a guess.

Perhaps a word with S, which is common.

""SLING"" has I and L, but I absent.

""SONLY"" not a word.

""SNOWY"" – S,N,O,W,Y. But no L? Must have L.

So not.

""SLOWY"" not.

""LOVES"" no.

""BLESS"" has E and S, but E absent.

So hard to include S without forbidden vowels.

""POSH"" too short.

""PLUSH"" has U and H, but U absent.

So ""BLOWN"" seems a reasonable choice.

I'll go with ""BLOWN"".

But in ""BLOWN"", we have W, which might not be ideal, but it's okay.

Another word: ""BOWEL"" has E and W, E absent.

""FOWLS"" – F,O,W,L,S. Positions: F at 1, O at 2, W at 3, L at 4, S at 5.

L at position 4: allowed (not 5).

But N is not included? Must include N.

So no.

""OWLETS"" too long.

So I think ""BLOWN"" is fine.

Perhaps ""NOBLE"" but E absent.

So ""BLOWN"" it is.

But let's see if there's a word with O and S.

""SOLID"" has I.

""SOLAR"" has A and R.

""SOLES"" has E.

""SONGS"" – S,O,N,G,S – repeated S, and no L.

Must have L.

""LONGS"" – L,O,N,G,S. Positions: L at 1, O at 2, N at 3, G at 4, S at 5.

Now, L at 1: allowed (not 5).
N at 3: allowed (not 2 or 4).

Letters: L, O, N, G, S – all allowed, no absent letters.

""LONGS"" is a valid word, meaning long pants or a verb form.

It might be accepted.

And it has S, which is common.

So ""LONGS"" might be better than ""BLOWN"" because it has S and G instead of B and W.

G frequency 1.87%, S 6.51%, O 7.64%, L 4.07%, N 7.23%.

S is more common than W or B.

So ""LONGS"" is a good choice.

Similarly, we test L at position 1 and N at position 3.

Both new positions.

So I'll go with ""LONGS"".

<thinking>
From previous feedback:
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, U, T, I
- Present letters: N (not in pos 2 or 4) and L (not in pos 5)
- Must include both N and L in the new guess, avoiding absent letters and placing N not in 2/4 and L not in 5.

Chose ""LONGS"" because:
- L is in position 1 (new position, not 5)
- N is in position 3 (new position, not 2 or 4)
- Uses new common letters: O, G, S (S is high-frequency)
- Valid English word with distinct letters.

This tests:
- If L is in position 1
- If N is in position 3
- Presence of O, G, S

Feedback will help narrow down the possibilities significantly.
</thinking>

<guess>LONGS</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

<thinking>
1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 2 (CRANE):** C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)  
     - This means:  
       - C, R, A, E are **absent** from the secret word.  
       - N is **present** but not in position 4 (since it got ""-"" for position 4).  
   - **Guess 3 (UNTIL):** U(x), N(-), T(x), I(x), L(-)  
     - This means:  
       - U, T, I are **absent** from the secret word.  
       - N is **present** but not in position 2 (new information, as it was already known to not be in position 4).  
       - L is **present** but not in position 5 (since it got ""-"" for position 5).  

2. **Summary of Known Information:**
   - **Absent Letters:** C, R, A, E, U, T, I (cannot be used in new guesses).  
   - **Present Letters:**  
     - N: Must be in the word but not in positions 2 or 4. Possible positions: 1, 3, or 5.  
     - L: Must be in the word but not in position 5. Possible positions: 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
   - **Word Length:** 5 letters.  
   - **Constraints:**  
     - The new guess must include both N and L (since they are confirmed present).  
     - Avoid all absent letters (C, R, A, E, U, T, I).  
     - N cannot be placed in positions 2 or 4.  
     - L cannot be placed in position 5.  

3. **Strategy for New Guess:**
   - **Goal:** Maximize information by testing new high-frequency letters and narrowing positions for N and L.  
   - **Available Letters:** Focus on unused, common English letters: O, S, H, D, M, P, B, G, W, Y, etc. (since C, R, A, E, U, T, I are ruled out).  
   - **Letter Frequency Priority:** S (6.51%), O (7.64%), L (4.07%), N (7.23%), H (5.05%), D (3.82%) — based on English letter frequency.  
   - **Position Testing:**  
     - Place N in a new untested position (1, 3, or 5) to gather more data.  
     - Place L in a new untested position (1, 2, 3, or 4) to gather more data.  
   - **Avoid Repeats:** Use distinct letters to cover more ground.  

4. **Candidate Word Selection:**
   - **Options Considered:**  
     - **BLOWN:** B, L, O, W, N. L in position 2 (allowed), N in position 5 (allowed). Tests B, O, W.  
     - **NOBLY:** N, O, B, L, Y. N in position 1 (allowed), L in position 4 (allowed). Tests O, B, Y.  
     - **LONGS:** L, O, N, G, S. L in position 1 (allowed), N in position 3 (allowed). Tests O, G, S.  
   - **Why LONGS?**  
     - Includes both N and L in allowed positions: L at 1 (not 5) and N at 3 (not 2 or 4).  
     - Introduces high-frequency S (6.51%) and O (7.64%), plus G (1.87%) for broad coverage.  
     - All letters are distinct and not ruled out (no C, R, A, E, U, T, I).  
     - Valid English word (noun/verb, e.g., ""long pants"" or ""desires"").  
     - Tests key positions: If L is correct at position 1, or N at position 3, feedback will be very informative.  

5. **Expected Outcome:**  
   - Feedback on L at position 1 and N at position 3 will help confirm/correct their positions.  
   - New letters (O, G, S) will reveal if they are present/absent, further narrowing the word list.  
   - With only 6 tries, this guess efficiently uses known constraints to reduce possibilities.

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, the user is asking for the first guess in the game. Since it's the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with. I need to choose a good starting word.

A common strategy in word games like Wordle is to pick a word that includes frequently used letters to maximize the information gained. Vowels and common consonants are often good choices.

Looking at English letter frequency, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. For Wordle, words with multiple vowels or a balance of vowels and consonants are preferred.

Some popular starting words are:

- ""CRANE"": Includes C, R, A, N, E – covering common consonants and vowels.

- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – also good coverage.

- ""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T – similar.

I should choose a word that has:

- At least two or three vowels.

- Common consonants.

- No repeating letters, if possible, to cover more ground.

""CRANE"" seems solid: C, R, A, N, E – all fairly common letters, and it has three vowels (A, E) if we consider Y sometimes, but here it's A and E.

Vowels: A and E are vowels, C, R, N are consonants.

""A"" and ""E"" are vowels, ""C"", ""R"", ""N"" are consonants.

Perhaps I should pick a word with more vowels. ""ADIEU"" is another popular starter because it has four vowels: A, I, E, U.

But ""ADIEU"" has D, which is common, but might not be ideal if I want utility consonants.

In Wordle, vowels are crucial because they appear in many words.

Since this is the first guess, my goal is to get as much information as possible, not necessarily to guess the word right away.

After this guess, I'll get feedback, which I can use for subsequent guesses.

For rule compliance: my guess must be a valid 5-letter English word.

I need to ensure that the word I pick is valid.

""CRANE"" is definitely a valid word.

""SLATE"" is fine too.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" for a balanced approach.

""SOARE"" is sometimes used, but ""SOARE"" might be less common; ""CRANE"" is better known.

Another one is ""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E – which has three vowels: A, I, E, and common consonants.

Similarly, ""ROATE"" or ""CRATE"".

But ""CRANE"" is similar.

To maximize letter coverage, ""CRANE"" has five distinct letters: C, R, A, N, E.

E is a vowel, A is a vowel.

In terms of frequency, E, A, R are top letters.

E is the most common letter, A is second or third, depending on source.

According to Wikipedia: E, T, A, O, I, N are the top letters.

""CRANE"" has E, A, but not T? C is less common than T.

""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E – S is common, L is common, A, T, E are top.

T is more common than C.

Letter frequencies: E 12.49%, T 9.28%, A 8.04%, O 7.64%, I 7.57%, N 7.23%, S 6.51%, R 6.28%, H 5.05%, L 4.07%, etc.

""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – S=6.51%, L=4.07%, A=8.04%, T=9.28%, E=12.49%. Average or sum?

Each letter's frequency contributes to the probability.

But ""SLATE"" has no repeated letters and covers high-frequency letters.

Similarly, ""CRANE"": C=3.34%, R=6.28%, A=8.04%, N=7.23%, E=12.49%. C is less frequent.

Perhaps ""ALERT"": A, L, E, R, T – A=8.04%, L=4.07%, E=12.49%, R=6.28%, T=9.28%.

Or ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E – I=7.57%, R=6.28%, A=8.04%, T=9.28%, E=12.49%. ""IRATE"" seems good as it has five of the top seven letters if we consider I and E.

E, T, A, I, N are top five after E, but N is missing.

""RAISE"": R=6.28%, A=8.04%, I=7.57%, S=6.51%, E=12.49%. All high-frequency.

I think ""RAISE"" or ""SLATE"" would be fine.

But I recall that in Wordle, starting words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are often recommended.

Since the user didn't specify a word list, I'll assume any valid English word.

To be safe, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

Another popular choice is ""SOARE"", which is a word meaning a young hawk, but it might be obscure; better to use common words.

""ADIEU"" has A, D, I, E, U – D is common, U is vowel, but D frequency is 3.82%, which is fine.

But ""ADIEU"" focuses on vowels, which might leave consonants uncovered.

I think ""CRANE"" is a good choice for a broad coverage.

I'll use ""CRANE"" as the first guess.

For the response, I need to provide my thought process within <thinking></thinking> tags, and then the guess in <guess></guess> tags.

Specifically:
```xml
<thinking>
[step-by-step thought here]
</thinking>
<guess>CRANE</guess>
```

In the thought process, I should reason step by step.

Thought process:
- For the first guess, no prior information.
- Aim to maximize information by choosing a word with high-frequency letters.
- Selected ""CRANE"" because it contains common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E), all distinct, to cover a wide range.

Make it concise but clear.<thinking>
For the first guess in this word guessing game, I have no prior feedback or information about the secret word. My goal is to maximize the information I gain by choosing a starting word that covers commonly used English letters. This will help narrow down possibilities with the feedback.

- I prioritize words with high-frequency letters based on English letter frequency (e.g., E, A, R, I, S, T, N) and include both vowels and consonants.
- A good starting word should have no repeating letters to cover more unique letters.
- After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", and ""CRANE"", I select ""CRANE"" because:
  - It contains two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
  - All letters are distinct, covering more ground.
  - ""CRANE"" is a valid English word and frequently used as a starter in similar games for its balanced letter coverage.

After this guess, I will use the feedback symbols (✓, -, x) to inform my next guesses.
</thinking>

<guess></guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1:  -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are at the beginning of the game. The user says: ""Make your first 5-letter word guess."" and then in the same message, they provide feedback that the first guess was invalid because it was not five letters. However, looking back, I didn't make a guess yet in this conversation. The user's message is: ""Make your first 5-letter word guess."" and then they add: ""Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.""

This seems like the user is simulating that I already made a guess that was invalid. But in reality, this is the first interaction. So I need to make the first valid guess.

The feedback says: ""Model answer is not five letters."" meaning that in a previous attempt, the model's answer was not five letters. But since this is the start, I should provide a five-letter word.

I think the user is setting up a scenario where my first attempt was invalid, so now I must provide a new first guess that is five letters.

Therefore, I should proceed to make a valid five-letter word guess.

I'll use the same reasoning as before and choose ""CRANE"".

But to be thorough, let me think again.

First guess: I need a valid 5-letter English word.

I choose ""CRANE"" for the reasons stated.

So, my response should be:

<thinking>
I see that a previous guess was invalid because it was not five letters. For this new first guess, I will ensure it is a valid 5-letter word. I choose ""CRANE"" as it contains common letters (C, R, A, N, E) to maximize information gain. All letters are distinct and it is a common starting word in word games.
</thinking>
<guess>CRANE</guess><thinking>
The previous feedback indicates that the initial guess was invalid because it was not a 5-letter word. For this new first guess, I must ensure the word is exactly 5 letters long and a valid English word. 

- Since this is the first valid guess, I aim to maximize information by selecting a word with high-frequency English letters (e.g., vowels and common consonants) and no repeating characters.
- Based on English letter frequency (E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S being among the most common), I consider words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"".
- I choose ""CRANE"" because:
  - It contains two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
  - All letters are distinct, covering a broad range of possibilities.
  - It is a recognized starting word in word games for its effectiveness.

This guess will provide feedback (✓, -, or x for each letter) to guide subsequent guesses.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1:  -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 2: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two previous guesses:
- Guess 1: Invalid (not five letters) – no useful information.
- Guess 2: ""CRANE"" with feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)

Interpretation of feedback for ""CRANE"":
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

Therefore, from this feedback, we know:
1. The letter N is present in the word, but not in the 4th position (since ""CRANE"" has N as the 4th letter).
2. The letters C, R, A, E are absent from the word.
3. Since only N is present, the word must contain N.

Additional constraints:
- The word is 5 letters long.
- We must avoid using C, R, A, E in any position.

We need to select a new guess that:
- Includes the letter N (because N is somewhere in the word).
- Does not include C, R, A, E (since they are confirmed absent).
- The letter N cannot be in the 4th position (because in ""CRANE"" it was in the 4th and got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but wrong position).

Possible positions for N: it can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

We also want to guess a word that covers new common letters to gain more information.

Available letters: We can use any letters except C, R, A, E. It's safe to avoid these.

Common letters to consider: T, O, I, S, H, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

We should aim for a word that includes N and other high-frequency letters not yet ruled out.

Since N is present, we can prioritize words that have N and also introduce vowels or consonants we haven't tested.

Vowels we can still use: O, I, U (since A and E are out).

Common consonants: T, S, L, etc.

A good candidate might include N and another vowel or two.

For example:
- Words like ""POINT"", but ""POINT"" has E? No, P,O,I,N,T – no E or A. But E is ruled out, so it's okay? Wait, no E, so good.
- However, we need to avoid C,R,A,E.

""POINT"": P,O,I,N,T – letters are P,O,I,N,T. None of C,R,A,E. And N is included.

But in ""POINT"", N is at position 4. But we know N cannot be in position 4? Wait, it can be in other positions? The feedback says N is in the word but not in position 4. So in a new word, N could be in position 1,2,3,5.

In ""POINT"", N is in position 4, but since the word has N in position 4, but the actual word has N not in position 4? The feedback doesn't say that N can't be in position 4 in general, only that in the secret word, N is not in position 4. So for our guess, we can place N in position 4 again, but that is still wrong, so it might give ""-"" again if N is elsewhere. But we know for sure that N is not at position 4 in the secret word.

Therefore, in our new guess, to gain more information, it's better to place N in a different position: positions 1,2,3, or 5.

But we don't know which, so perhaps try N in another position.

Also, we want to test other letters.

So, a word with N not in the 4th position and avoiding C,R,A,E.

Possible words:
- Option: ""SNOWY"" – S,N,O,W,Y. N is in position 2. Avoided C,R,A,E? R is ruled out, but S,N,O,W,Y are all different.
- Or ""UNITY"" – U,N,I,T,Y. N at position 2. Avoids C,R,A,E.

But ""SNOWY"" has Y, which is less common.

Better to use more common letters: T, O, I, S, etc.

Another word: ""TONIC"" – T,O,N,I,C. But C is ruled out! Cannot use C.

Avoid C.

So ""TONIC"" is invalid.

Perhaps ""POINT"" but with N not at 4: isn't that fixed? We need a word with N not at 4? No, we can use any position, but N not at 4 in the secret.

For guessing, we can place N anywhere, but it might be more informative to put it in a position we haven't tested yet.

Since position 4 is ruled out, we can test, say position 1 or 2.

For example, ""NOSEY"" – N,O,S,E,Y. But E is ruled out! Cannot use E.

We must avoid E.

So words without E or A,C,R.

List possible vowels: O, I, U, Y (sometimes), but Y is consonant too.

Common words without E or A: for example, ""POUND"", ""MOUND"", etc.

""POUND"": P,O,U,N,D. N at position 4? Position 4 is N? But N cannot be at position 4 in the secret word? In ""POUND"", N is at 4, but we suspect it's wrong because in ""CRANE"" N at 4 got ""-"", meaning it exists but elsewhere. So if we put N at 4 again, and if it's not in secret at 4, we get ""-"", but we already know that. Waste of a position.

Better to put N at a new position to test it.

So positions available: 1,2,3,5.

Perhaps put N at position 1 or 5.

Try ""NIGHT"": N,I,G,H,T. N at position 1. Avoids C,R,A,E? I, G, H, T – yes.

""NIFTY"": N,I,F,T,Y – also possible.

But ""OUIJA"" is a word but not common; avoid.

""INPUT"": I,N,P,U,T – N at position 2.

""MINTS"": M,I,N,T,S – N at position 3.

To cover multiple new letters: select a word with O, I, U and consonants like T,S,L.

Avoid C,R,A,E.

""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T – no N? But we must include N because we know it's in the word.

We must include N, otherwise if N isn't in the guess, we won't get info if there are other positions.

If we don't put N, we might miss confirming its position or presence.

No, since we know N is present, we should include it to find its position.

In this guess, include N in a new position.

Also, introduce other common letters not used or ruled out.

Letters not tried: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z but avoid C,R,A,E specifically.

Most common available: S, T, O, I, L, U, etc.

A good word with N and these.

Possible candidate: ""POINT"" but N at 4, which might not be optimal for position testing.

""JOINT"": J,O,I,N,T – J is less common.

Better: ""UNLIT"" – U,N,L,I,T. N at position 2.

Or ""SNAIL"" but A is ruled out. Cannot.

Since A and E are out, words with O, I, U vowels.

Another idea: ""THINK"" – T,H,I,N,K. N at position 4? Position 4 is N.

Position: in ""THINK"", positions: 1-T,2-H,3-I,4-N,5-K.

N at 4, same issue.

""STINK"": S,T,I,N,K – N at 4.

Many words have N at 4.

To avoid position 4, try words like ""SNOUT"" – S,N,O,U,T. N at 2.

""CLING"" but C is out.

""BLUNT"": B,L,U,N,T. N at 4? Positions:1-B,2-L,3-U,4-N,5-T. N at 4 again.

""NUDGE"" has E, out.

""DOWNY"" – D,O,W,N,Y. N at 4? Positions: 1-D,2-O,3-W,4-N,5-Y. N at 4.

It's hard to find words with N not at 4.

Position N at 1: ""NOISE"" – has E, out.

""NAIVE"" – A and E out.

""NOMAD"" – A out.

""NOTCH"" – C out? C is ruled out.

""NYMPH"" – N,Y,M,P,H.

""NYMPH"" is a word: N at position 1.

Letters: N,Y,M,P,H – all permissible? Y,M,P,H are allowed, since C,R,A,E are the only rules.

H not ruled out.

Similarly, ""LYMPH"" is also a word, but L,Y,M,P,H.

But ""NYMPH"" is better.

Or ""NIGHT"" as I thought.

But ""NYMPH"" might be obscure.

Better common words: ""KNOWN"" – has repeated N? Positions: K,N,O,W,N – N at positions 2 and 5? Repeated letters? But ""KNOWN"" has double N, but we don't know if secret has repeated letters, but usually it's better to avoid repeats for information.

Assume no repeats for now.

""TIMID"" – no N.

""POUND"" – N at 4.

""MOUNT"" – M,O,U,N,T – N at 4.

Why not place N at position 3 or 5?

For example, ""BANJO"" but A out.

""PINKO"" – P,I,N,K,O – N at position 3.

Letters P,I,N,K,O – all allowed? O is vowel, P,I,K,O and N.

P,I,N,K,O: no C,R,A,E.

K might be less common, but possible.

Another word: ""LINGO"" – L,I,N,G,O – N at 3? Positions: L,I,N,G,O – N position 3.

Good.

""MINTO"" might not be common.

""STUNG"" – S,T,U,N,G – N at 4? Positions: S,T,U,N,G – N position 4.

Always at 4 or repeated.

""USING"" – U,S,I,N,G – N at 4.

Perhaps ""HINGE"" has E, out.

To have N at 5: words ending with N, like ""WINN"" not 5 letters; ""BEGIN"" has E? B,E,G,I,N – E is ruled out.

""ROBIN"" has R, ruled out.

""SPAIN"" has A and S,P,I,N but A out.

""BRAIN"" has B,R,A,I,N – R and A out.

So hard to find words with N at end without A or E.

""GIVEN"" has E.

""OXBOW"" no N.

""CUMIN"" has C and U,M,I,N – C ruled out.

""TUMID"" – no E or A? T,U,M,I,D – no N.

Perhaps ""UNPIN"" – U,N,P,I,N – repeated N, not ideal.

Another word: ""QUINT"" – Q,U,I,N,T – Q less common.

But valid.

Perhaps ""POINT"" but N at 4, we can use it, and since we know N not at 4, we place it at 4 and get ""-"" again, but we also test other letters.

To save a turn and gain more info, it's better to move N.

Ideal: ""SNAKY"" – S,N,A,K,Y but A out.

""DOING"" – D,O,I,N,G – N at 4.

Positions: 1-D,2-O,3-I,4-N,5-G. N at 4.

But we can accept N at a different position? Like position 1 or 2 etc.

For example, ""KNIFE"" has E and F.

""WHINE"" has E.

""SHINY"" – S,H,I,N,Y – N at 4? Positions: S,H,I,N,Y – N position 4.

List words with N not at position 4.

- Position 1: ""NOISY"" but O,I,S,Y – N at 1? ""NOISY"" has S and Y, but letters N,O,I,S,Y – O and I vowels. But position: N at 1.

""NOISY"" is valid.

""NUTSY"" not common.

""NEWSY"" has E? N,E,W,S,Y – E ruled out.

""NOXIOUS"" too long.

""NASTY"" has S,T,Y but A out.

""NADIR"" has A and R out.

""NEIGH"" has E.

So ""NOISY"": N,O,I,S,Y – N at position 1.

No C,R,E,A.

Yes.

Similarly, ""NOUNS"" – N,O,U,N,S – N at 1 and 4, repeated.

Bad.

""LOINS"" – L,O,I,N,S – N at position 4.

So ""NOISY"" seems okay.

"" TIMID"" no N.

Another option: ""UNITY"" – U,N,I,T,Y – N at position 2.

U and I vowels.

""UNIFY"" also valid, U,N,I,F,Y.

Or ""ONION"" repeated O.

Avoid.

So ""UNITY"" or ""NOISY"".

""NOISY"" has S and Y, ""UNITY"" has T and Y.

Both include Y, which might be less common.

But permissible.

Perhaps ""MOUNT"" but N at 4.

I think ""NOISY"" or ""UNITY"" are fine.

To prioritize common letters, ""STOIC"" has C? No, C out.

""POINTS"" too long.

Five-letter word.

Another common word without E/A: ""PILOT"" but no N.

Must include N.

So I'll go with ""UNITY"": U,N,I,T,Y – letters U, N, I, T, Y.

N is at position 2.

Feedback will tell us if N is at position 2 or not.

Also test U, I, T, Y.

If U, I, T, Y are present or not.

But since no C,R,A,E, it's safe.

""UNITY"" might be a good choice.

To avoid Y, use another word.

""INPUT"": I,N,P,U,T – N at 2.

Similarly, P is less common than T in ""UNITY"".

But T is more frequent.

T frequency 9.28%, P is 2.03%, so ""UNITY"" with T is better than ""INPUT"" with P.

""UNITY"" has U,N,I,T,Y.

Y frequency is about 1.66%, low.

""UNTIL"" – U,N,T,I,L – L is common.

""UNTIL"" : U,N,T,I,L – positions:1-U,2-N,3-T,4-I,5-L. N at 2.

L is better than Y.

Letters U,N,T,I,L.

Frequency: U=3.10%, N=7.23%, T=9.28%, I=7.57%, L=4.07%. Better than Y.

And avoid C,R,A,E.

""UNTIL"" is a valid English word.

Perfect.

Similarly, ""LINED"" has E.

So ""UNTIL"" is better.

Therefore, choose ""UNTIL"".Based on the previous feedback for ""CRANE"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x), we know:
- Letters C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.
- The letter N **is** in the word, but not in the 4th position (since it received ""-"" in position 4 of ""CRANE"").

For the new guess:
- Must include the letter N (as it is present) but not in the 4th position.
- Avoid using C, R, A, E entirely.
- Should cover new common letters to maximize information gain. Prioritizing high-frequency letters like T, I, U, L, O, S, etc., while ensuring the word is valid and has no repeated letters for better coverage.

After evaluating options:
- Chose ""UNTIL"" because:
  - It includes N in position 2 (a new position to test).
  - Contains other common letters: U, T, I, L (all untested and high-frequency).
  - No ruled-out letters (C, R, A, E), and all letters are distinct.
  - Helps test vowels U/I and consonants T/L.

This guess should provide valuable feedback to narrow down the secret word.

<thinking>
- Summary of previous feedback: Only N is present (wrong position), C/R/A/E absent.
- Goal: Guess a 5-letter word including N, not in position 4, avoiding C/R/A/E.
- Selected ""UNTIL"" because:
  - N is in position 2 (testing a new position).
  - Uses high-frequency untested letters U, T, I, L.
  - Vali English word with distinct letters for maximum information.
- Expected to gain feedback on N's position and presence of U/T/I/L.
</thinking>

<guess>UNTIL</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1:  -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 2: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 3: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(x) L(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback history:
- Guess 1: Invalid (not five letters) – no useful info.
- Guess 2: ""CRANE"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x) → So N is in the word but not in position 4; C, R, A, E are absent.
- Guess 3: ""UNTIL"" → U(x), N(-), T(x), I(x), L(-) → This means:
  - U is absent (x)
  - N is present but not in position 2 (since it got - for position 2)
  - T is absent (x)
  - I is absent (x)
  - L is present but not in position 5 (since it got - for position 5)

From all feedback so far:
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, U, T, I (so we must avoid these)
- Present letters: N and L (both are in the word but not in their guessed positions)
  - N is not in position 2 or 4 (from guesses 2 and 3)
  - L is not in position 5 (from guess 3)

We also know the word has 5 letters.

Now, since N and L are present, and we have two positions ruled out for N (2 and 4) and one for L (5), we need to find a word that:
- Includes both N and L (since they are confirmed present)
- Avoids C, R, A, E, U, T, I
- Places N not in positions 2 or 4
- Places L not in position 5

Possible positions for N: 1, 3, or 5 (since 2 and 4 are ruled out)
Possible positions for L: 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since 5 is ruled out)

We also need to introduce new letters to gain more information. The remaining letters to test should be from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, S, V, W, Y, etc.

Common letters among these: O, S, H, D, M, P, etc.

We should aim for a word that has N and L in allowed positions and uses common unused letters.

Let's consider possible positions:

Option 1: N at position 1, L at position 3 (for example). Then we need to fill other positions.

But we don't know, so we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities.

Since we have limited vowels left (O is the main vowel available, as A, E, I, U are out), we should include O if possible.

Vowels available: O, and sometimes Y.

Consonants: S, H, D, M, P, etc.

A good candidate word: ""LOINS"" but L is at position 1, and we have L present, but we don't know if it can be at 1? We only know it's not at 5, so it can be at 1.

But ""LOINS"" has I and S? I is absent, so cannot use I.

Avoid I.

Similarly, ""LONGS"" – L,O,N,G,S. Positions: L at 1, O at 2, N at 3, G at 4, S at 5.

Now, check:
- L at position 1: allowed? We only know L not at 5, so position 1 is possible.
- N at position 3: allowed? We know N not at 2 or 4, so position 3 is allowed.

Letters: L, O, N, G, S – all not in the absent list? Absent: C,R,A,E,U,T,I. So O, G, S are allowed.

But we have to check if G and S are available.

Yes.

However, we have two present letters: L and N, and we are placing them in new positions.

Also, we introduce O, G, S.

But ""LONGS"" is a word? It can be a verb meaning longs for, or plural of long? But in word games, it's often accepted.

To be safe, another word: ""BOLDS"" – but B,O,L,D,S. L at 3? Positions: B,O,L,D,S – L at 3. But we need to include N? We must include N because it's present.

We cannot omit N.

So the word must have both L and N.

Another word: ""SLUNG"" but S,L,U,N,G – U is absent, so no.

""PLANK"" has A, absent.

""CLANK"" has C and A.

""FLING"" has I, absent.

""BLOWN"" – B,L,O,W,N. Positions: B at 1, L at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5.

Now, check positions:
- L at position 2: we don't have any feedback on L at 2, so it's allowed (we only know not at 5).
- N at position 5: we know N not at 2 or 4, but position 5 is allowed? Yes, because we only ruled out 2 and 4 for N.

So N can be at 5.

Similarly, L at 2 is allowed.

Letters: B, L, O, W, N – all not in absent list? B, O, W, N, L. Absent letters: C,R,A,E,U,T,I. So B, O, W are new and allowed.

""BLOWN"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""GROWN"" has R, absent.

""SHOWN"" – S,H,O,W,N. Positions: S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5.

N at 5, which is allowed.

But L is not included? We must include L because it is present.

We cannot omit L. Both N and L must be in the word.

So ""SHOWN"" has no L, so it would be invalid because L is missing.

Similarly, any guess must include both N and L.

So back to ""BLOWN"": it has L and N.

L at position 2, N at position 5.

We can also consider ""OWNS"" too short.

""SLOW"" too short.

""NOBLY"" – N,O,B,L,Y. Positions: N at 1, O at 2, B at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.

Now, N at 1: allowed (not 2 or 4).
L at 4: allowed (we only know not at 5, so 4 is fine).

Letters: N, O, B, L, Y – all allowed.

""NOBLY"" is an adverb, meaning in a noble manner.

Similarly, ""NOBLY"" might be acceptable.

But Y is less common.

""POLED"" has E, absent.

""SOLID"" has I and O, but I absent.

""SOLID"" not allowed.

""MOULD"" has U, absent.

""GOLD"" too short.

Another word: ""BONUS"" – B,O,N,U,S. U is absent, so no.

""SONIC"" has C and I, absent.

So ""BLOWN"" and ""NOBLY"" are candidates.

""BLOWN"" has W, which is less common, but okay.

""LOVES"" has E and O, but E absent.

""PONDS"" – P,O,N,D,S. But no L? Must have L.

So not.

""LANDS"" has A, absent.

""BONDS"" – B,O,N,D,S. No L.

So must include L.

""BLOND"" – B,L,O,N,D. Positions: B at 1, L at 2, O at 3, N at 4, D at 5.

But N at position 4: we know N cannot be at position 4 (from guess 2). So this is invalid for the guess because we know N is not at 4, so we shouldn't place it there.

Similarly, in ""BLOWN"", N is at 5, which is okay.

In ""NOBLY"", N at 1 and L at 4, both allowed positions.

""NOBLY"" has L at 4, which is allowed since we only know L not at 5.

Similarly, ""BLOWN"" has L at 2 and N at 5.

Now, which one to choose? Both are valid.

""BLOWN"" introduces B, O, W.

""NOBLY"" introduces O, B, Y.

W is less common than Y? W frequency 1.83%, Y 1.66%, similar.

But O and B are common.

Perhaps ""BLOWN"" is more common.

Another word: ""FLOWN"" has F,L,O,W,N. But F is allowed? Absent letters don't include F. F is 1.96% frequency.

""FLOWN"" positions: F at 1, L at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5.

L at 2, N at 5, both allowed.

But we have F and W, which are less common.

""BLOWN"" is better with B.

But B is also less common (1.49%).

Perhaps a word with S or H.

""SLOWN"" not a word.

""SHOWN"" no L.

""SNOWL"" not a word.

""LOVNS"" not.

So I think ""BLOWN"" or ""NOBLY"".

Let's choose ""BLOWN"" for now.

But we can also consider ""LOWNS"" not a word.

""KNOWL"" not.

Another one: ""OWLED"" has E.

So I'll go with ""BLOWN"".

But in ""BLOWN"", L is at position 2. We don't know if L can be at 2, but it's possible.

Similarly, N at 5.

We also test B, O, W.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

But we have to include L and N.

Another candidate: ""POLYP"" has O,L,Y,P but no N.

""NYLON"" – N,Y,L,O,N – repeated N? Positions: N at 1, Y at 2, L at 3, O at 4, N at 5. Repeated N, and N at 1 and 5. But we know N is present, but it might be repeated? But in word games, words can have repeated letters, but for guessing, it's better to avoid to test more letters.

But ""NYLON"" has N at 1 and 5, but we don't know if it's repeated. Also, position 4 is O, which is new.

But repeated N might not be efficient.

Stick with distinct letters.

""NOBLY"" has distinct: N,O,B,L,Y.

""BLOWN"" has distinct: B,L,O,W,N.

""BLOWN"" has W, which is less common, but okay.

Perhaps ""BOWLN"" not a word.

I think both are fine.

Let's choose ""BLOWN"".

But we have another option: ""GONAD"" has A and D, but A absent.

""BONED"" has E.

""CONED"" has C and E.

So no.

""LOVES"" has E.

""DOZEN"" has E and O, but E absent.

So I think ""BLOWN"" is acceptable.

But let's confirm the feedback for L: in ""UNTIL"", L was at position 5 and got ""-"", meaning L is in the word but not at position 5. So in ""BLOWN"", L is at position 2, which is a new position, so it could be correct or not.

Similarly for N at 5.

Now, we need to make a guess.

Perhaps a word with S, which is common.

""SLING"" has I and L, but I absent.

""SONLY"" not a word.

""SNOWY"" – S,N,O,W,Y. But no L? Must have L.

So not.

""SLOWY"" not.

""LOVES"" no.

""BLESS"" has E and S, but E absent.

So hard to include S without forbidden vowels.

""POSH"" too short.

""PLUSH"" has U and H, but U absent.

So ""BLOWN"" seems a reasonable choice.

I'll go with ""BLOWN"".

But in ""BLOWN"", we have W, which might not be ideal, but it's okay.

Another word: ""BOWEL"" has E and W, E absent.

""FOWLS"" – F,O,W,L,S. Positions: F at 1, O at 2, W at 3, L at 4, S at 5.

L at position 4: allowed (not 5).

But N is not included? Must include N.

So no.

""OWLETS"" too long.

So I think ""BLOWN"" is fine.

Perhaps ""NOBLE"" but E absent.

So ""BLOWN"" it is.

But let's see if there's a word with O and S.

""SOLID"" has I.

""SOLAR"" has A and R.

""SOLES"" has E.

""SONGS"" – S,O,N,G,S – repeated S, and no L.

Must have L.

""LONGS"" – L,O,N,G,S. Positions: L at 1, O at 2, N at 3, G at 4, S at 5.

Now, L at 1: allowed (not 5).
N at 3: allowed (not 2 or 4).

Letters: L, O, N, G, S – all allowed, no absent letters.

""LONGS"" is a valid word, meaning long pants or a verb form.

It might be accepted.

And it has S, which is common.

So ""LONGS"" might be better than ""BLOWN"" because it has S and G instead of B and W.

G frequency 1.87%, S 6.51%, O 7.64%, L 4.07%, N 7.23%.

S is more common than W or B.

So ""LONGS"" is a good choice.

Similarly, we test L at position 1 and N at position 3.

Both new positions.

So I'll go with ""LONGS"".

<thinking>
From previous feedback:
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, U, T, I
- Present letters: N (not in pos 2 or 4) and L (not in pos 5)
- Must include both N and L in the new guess, avoiding absent letters and placing N not in 2/4 and L not in 5.

Chose ""LONGS"" because:
- L is in position 1 (new position, not 5)
- N is in position 3 (new position, not 2 or 4)
- Uses new common letters: O, G, S (S is high-frequency)
- Valid English word with distinct letters.

This tests:
- If L is in position 1
- If N is in position 3
- Presence of O, G, S

Feedback will help narrow down the possibilities significantly.
</thinking>

<guess>LONGS</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

<thinking>
1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 2 (CRANE):** C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)  
     - This means:  
       - C, R, A, E are **absent** from the secret word.  
       - N is **present** but not in position 4 (since it got ""-"" for position 4).  
   - **Guess 3 (UNTIL):** U(x), N(-), T(x), I(x), L(-)  
     - This means:  
       - U, T, I are **absent** from the secret word.  
       - N is **present** but not in position 2 (new information, as it was already known to not be in position 4).  
       - L is **present** but not in position 5 (since it got ""-"" for position 5).  

2. **Summary of Known Information:**
   - **Absent Letters:** C, R, A, E, U, T, I (cannot be used in new guesses).  
   - **Present Letters:**  
     - N: Must be in the word but not in positions 2 or 4. Possible positions: 1, 3, or 5.  
     - L: Must be in the word but not in position 5. Possible positions: 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
   - **Word Length:** 5 letters.  
   - **Constraints:**  
     - The new guess must include both N and L (since they are confirmed present).  
     - Avoid all absent letters (C, R, A, E, U, T, I).  
     - N cannot be placed in positions 2 or 4.  
     - L cannot be placed in position 5.  

3. **Strategy for New Guess:**
   - **Goal:** Maximize information by testing new high-frequency letters and narrowing positions for N and L.  
   - **Available Letters:** Focus on unused, common English letters: O, S, H, D, M, P, B, G, W, Y, etc. (since C, R, A, E, U, T, I are ruled out).  
   - **Letter Frequency Priority:** S (6.51%), O (7.64%), L (4.07%), N (7.23%), H (5.05%), D (3.82%) — based on English letter frequency.  
   - **Position Testing:**  
     - Place N in a new untested position (1, 3, or 5) to gather more data.  
     - Place L in a new untested position (1, 2, 3, or 4) to gather more data.  
   - **Avoid Repeats:** Use distinct letters to cover more ground.  

4. **Candidate Word Selection:**
   - **Options Considered:**  
     - **BLOWN:** B, L, O, W, N. L in position 2 (allowed), N in position 5 (allowed). Tests B, O, W.  
     - **NOBLY:** N, O, B, L, Y. N in position 1 (allowed), L in position 4 (allowed). Tests O, B, Y.  
     - **LONGS:** L, O, N, G, S. L in position 1 (allowed), N in position 3 (allowed). Tests O, G, S.  
   - **Why LONGS?**  
     - Includes both N and L in allowed positions: L at 1 (not 5) and N at 3 (not 2 or 4).  
     - Introduces high-frequency S (6.51%) and O (7.64%), plus G (1.87%) for broad coverage.  
     - All letters are distinct and not ruled out (no C, R, A, E, U, T, I).  
     - Valid English word (noun/verb, e.g., ""long pants"" or ""desires"").  
     - Tests key positions: If L is correct at position 1, or N at position 3, feedback will be very informative.  

5. **Expected Outcome:**  
   - Feedback on L at position 1 and N at position 3 will help confirm/correct their positions.  
   - New letters (O, G, S) will reveal if they are present/absent, further narrowing the word list.  
   - With only 6 tries, this guess efficiently uses known constraints to reduce possibilities.

Vowels and common consonants are often good choices.\n\nLooking at English letter frequency, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. For Wordle, words with multiple vowels or a balance of vowels and consonants are preferred.\n\nSome popular starting words are:\n\n- ""CRANE"": Includes C, R, A, N, E – covering common consonants and vowels.\n\n- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – also good coverage.\n\n- ""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T – similar.\n\nI should choose a word that has:\n\n- At least two or three vowels.\n\n- Common consonants.\n\n- No repeating letters, if possible, to cover more ground.\n\n""CRANE"" seems solid: C, R, A, N, E – all fairly common letters, and it has three vowels (A, E) if we consider Y sometimes, but here it\'s A and E.\n\nVowels: A and E are vowels, C, R, N are consonants.\n\n""A"" and ""E"" are vowels, ""C"", ""R"", ""N"" are consonants.\n\nPerhaps I should pick a word with more vowels. ""ADIEU"" is another popular starter because it has four vowels: A, I, E, U.\n\nBut ""ADIEU"" has D, which is common, but might not be ideal if I want utility consonants.\n\nIn Wordle, vowels are crucial because they appear in many words.\n\nSince this is the first guess, my goal is to get as much information as possible, not necessarily to guess the word right away.\n\nAfter this guess, I\'ll get feedback, which I can use for subsequent guesses.\n\nFor rule compliance: my guess must be a valid 5-letter English word.\n\nI need to ensure that the word I pick is valid.\n\n""CRANE"" is definitely a valid word.\n\n""SLATE"" is fine too.\n\nI\'ll go with ""CRANE"" for a balanced approach.\n\n""SOARE"" is sometimes used, but ""SOARE"" might be less common; ""CRANE"" is better known.\n\nAnother one is ""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E – which has three vowels: A, I, E, and common consonants.\n\nSimilarly, ""ROATE"" or ""CRATE"".\n\nBut ""CRANE"" is similar.\n\nTo maximize letter coverage, ""CRANE"" has five distinct letters: C, R, A, N, E.\n\nE is a vowel, A is a vowel.\n\nIn terms of frequency, E, A, R are top letters.\n\nE is the most common letter, A is second or third, depending on source.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia: E, T, A, O, I, N are the top letters.\n\n""CRANE"" has E, A, but not T? C is less common than T.\n\n""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E – S is common, L is common, A, T, E are top.\n\nT is more common than C.\n\nLetter frequencies: E 12.49%, T 9.28%, A 8.04%, O 7.64%, I 7.57%, N 7.23%, S 6.51%, R 6.28%, H 5.05%, L 4.07%, etc.\n\n""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – S=6.51%, L=4.07%, A=8.04%, T=9.28%, E=12.49%. Average or sum?\n\nEach letter\'s frequency contributes to the probability.\n\nBut ""SLATE"" has no repeated letters and covers high-frequency letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""CRANE"": C=3.34%, R=6.28%, A=8.04%, N=7.23%, E=12.49%. C is less frequent.\n\nPerhaps ""ALERT"": A, L, E, R, T – A=8.04%, L=4.07%, E=12.49%, R=6.28%, T=9.28%.\n\nOr ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E – I=7.57%, R=6.28%, A=8.04%, T=9.28%, E=12.49%. ""IRATE"" seems good as it has five of the top seven letters if we consider I and E.\n\nE, T, A, I, N are top five after E, but N is missing.\n\n""RAISE"": R=6.28%, A=8.04%, I=7.57%, S=6.51%, E=12.49%. All high-frequency.\n\nI think ""RAISE"" or ""SLATE"" would be fine.\n\nBut I recall that in Wordle, starting words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are often recommended.\n\nSince the user didn\'t specify a word list, I\'ll assume any valid English word.\n\nTo be safe, I\'ll go with ""CRANE"".\n\nAnother popular choice is ""SOARE"", which is a word meaning a young hawk, but it might be obscure; better to use common words.\n\n""ADIEU"" has A, D, I, E, U – D is common, U is vowel, but D frequency is 3.82%, which is fine.\n\nBut ""ADIEU"" focuses on vowels, which might leave consonants uncovered.\n\nI think ""CRANE"" is a good choice for a broad coverage.\n\nI\'ll use ""CRANE"" as the first guess.\n\nFor the response, I need to provide my thought process within <thinking></thinking> tags, and then the guess in <guess></guess> tags.\n\nSpecifically:\n```xml\n<thinking>\n[step-by-step thought here]\n</thinking>\n<guess>CRANE</guess>\n```\n\nIn the thought process, I should reason step by step.\n\nThought process:\n- For the first guess, no prior information.\n- Aim to maximize information by choosing a word with high-frequency letters.\n- Selected ""CRANE"" because it contains common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E), all distinct, to cover a wide range.\n\nMake it concise but clear.<thinking>\nFor the first guess in this word guessing game, I have no prior feedback or information about the secret word. My goal is to maximize the information I gain by choosing a starting word that covers commonly used English letters. This will help narrow down possibilities with the feedback.\n\n- I prioritize words with high-frequency letters based on English letter frequency (e.g., E, A, R, I, S, T, N) and include both vowels and consonants.\n- A good starting word should have no repeating letters to cover more unique letters.\n- After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", and ""CRANE"", I select ""CRANE"" because:\n  - It contains two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).\n  - All letters are distinct, covering more ground.\n  - ""CRANE"" is a valid English word and frequently used as a starter in similar games for its balanced letter coverage.\n\nAfter this guess, I will use the feedback symbols (✓, -, x) to inform my next guesses.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess></guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1:  -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are at the beginning of the game. The user says: ""Make your first 5-letter word guess."" and then in the same message, they provide feedback that the first guess was invalid because it was not five letters. However, looking back, I didn\'t make a guess yet in this conversation. The user\'s message is: ""Make your first 5-letter word guess."" and then they add: ""Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.""\n\nThis seems like the user is simulating that I already made a guess that was invalid. But in reality, this is the first interaction. So I need to make the first valid guess.\n\nThe feedback says: ""Model answer is not five letters."" meaning that in a previous attempt, the model\'s answer was not five letters. But since this is the start, I should provide a five-letter word.\n\nI think the user is setting up a scenario where my first attempt was invalid, so now I must provide a new first guess that is five letters.\n\nTherefore, I should proceed to make a valid five-letter word guess.\n\nI\'ll use the same reasoning as before and choose ""CRANE"".\n\nBut to be thorough, let me think again.\n\nFirst guess: I need a valid 5-letter English word.\n\nI choose ""CRANE"" for the reasons stated.\n\nSo, my response should be:\n\n<thinking>\nI see that a previous guess was invalid because it was not five letters. For this new first guess, I will ensure it is a valid 5-letter word. I choose ""CRANE"" as it contains common letters (C, R, A, N, E) to maximize information gain. All letters are distinct and it is a common starting word in word games.\n</thinking>\n<guess>CRANE</guess><thinking>\nThe previous feedback indicates that the initial guess was invalid because it was not a 5-letter word. For this new first guess, I must ensure the word is exactly 5 letters long and a valid English word. \n\n- Since this is the first valid guess, I aim to maximize information by selecting a word with high-frequency English letters (e.g., vowels and common consonants) and no repeating characters.\n- Based on English letter frequency (E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S being among the most common), I consider words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"".\n- I choose ""CRANE"" because:\n  - It contains two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).\n  - All letters are distinct, covering a broad range of possibilities.\n  - It is a recognized starting word in word games for its effectiveness.\n\nThis guess will provide feedback (✓, -, or x for each letter) to guide subsequent guesses.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1:  -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.\nGuess 2: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two previous guesses:\n- Guess 1: Invalid (not five letters) – no useful information.\n- Guess 2: ""CRANE"" with feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\n\nInterpretation of feedback for ""CRANE"":\n- C is not in the word (x)\n- R is not in the word (x)\n- A is not in the word (x)\n- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-)\n- E is not in the word (x)\n\nTherefore, from this feedback, we know:\n1. The letter N is present in the word, but not in the 4th position (since ""CRANE"" has N as the 4th letter).\n2. The letters C, R, A, E are absent from the word.\n3. Since only N is present, the word must contain N.\n\nAdditional constraints:\n- The word is 5 letters long.\n- We must avoid using C, R, A, E in any position.\n\nWe need to select a new guess that:\n- Includes the letter N (because N is somewhere in the word).\n- Does not include C, R, A, E (since they are confirmed absent).\n- The letter N cannot be in the 4th position (because in ""CRANE"" it was in the 4th and got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but wrong position).\n\nPossible positions for N: it can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).\n\nWe also want to guess a word that covers new common letters to gain more information.\n\nAvailable letters: We can use any letters except C, R, A, E. It\'s safe to avoid these.\n\nCommon letters to consider: T, O, I, S, H, L, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\nWe should aim for a word that includes N and other high-frequency letters not yet ruled out.\n\nSince N is present, we can prioritize words that have N and also introduce vowels or consonants we haven\'t tested.\n\nVowels we can still use: O, I, U (since A and E are out).\n\nCommon consonants: T, S, L, etc.\n\nA good candidate might include N and another vowel or two.\n\nFor example:\n- Words like ""POINT"", but ""POINT"" has E? No, P,O,I,N,T – no E or A. But E is ruled out, so it\'s okay? Wait, no E, so good.\n- However, we need to avoid C,R,A,E.\n\n""POINT"": P,O,I,N,T – letters are P,O,I,N,T. None of C,R,A,E. And N is included.\n\nBut in ""POINT"", N is at position 4. But we know N cannot be in position 4? Wait, it can be in other positions? The feedback says N is in the word but not in position 4. So in a new word, N could be in position 1,2,3,5.\n\nIn ""POINT"", N is in position 4, but since the word has N in position 4, but the actual word has N not in position 4? The feedback doesn\'t say that N can\'t be in position 4 in general, only that in the secret word, N is not in position 4. So for our guess, we can place N in position 4 again, but that is still wrong, so it might give ""-"" again if N is elsewhere. But we know for sure that N is not at position 4 in the secret word.\n\nTherefore, in our new guess, to gain more information, it\'s better to place N in a different position: positions 1,2,3, or 5.\n\nBut we don\'t know which, so perhaps try N in another position.\n\nAlso, we want to test other letters.\n\nSo, a word with N not in the 4th position and avoiding C,R,A,E.\n\nPossible words:\n- Option: ""SNOWY"" – S,N,O,W,Y. N is in position 2. Avoided C,R,A,E? R is ruled out, but S,N,O,W,Y are all different.\n- Or ""UNITY"" – U,N,I,T,Y. N at position 2. Avoids C,R,A,E.\n\nBut ""SNOWY"" has Y, which is less common.\n\nBetter to use more common letters: T, O, I, S, etc.\n\nAnother word: ""TONIC"" – T,O,N,I,C. But C is ruled out! Cannot use C.\n\nAvoid C.\n\nSo ""TONIC"" is invalid.\n\nPerhaps ""POINT"" but with N not at 4: isn\'t that fixed? We need a word with N not at 4? No, we can use any position, but N not at 4 in the secret.\n\nFor guessing, we can place N anywhere, but it might be more informative to put it in a position we haven\'t tested yet.\n\nSince position 4 is ruled out, we can test, say position 1 or 2.\n\nFor example, ""NOSEY"" – N,O,S,E,Y. But E is ruled out! Cannot use E.\n\nWe must avoid E.\n\nSo words without E or A,C,R.\n\nList possible vowels: O, I, U, Y (sometimes), but Y is consonant too.\n\nCommon words without E or A: for example, ""POUND"", ""MOUND"", etc.\n\n""POUND"": P,O,U,N,D. N at position 4? Position 4 is N? But N cannot be at position 4 in the secret word? In ""POUND"", N is at 4, but we suspect it\'s wrong because in ""CRANE"" N at 4 got ""-"", meaning it exists but elsewhere. So if we put N at 4 again, and if it\'s not in secret at 4, we get ""-"", but we already know that. Waste of a position.\n\nBetter to put N at a new position to test it.\n\nSo positions available: 1,2,3,5.\n\nPerhaps put N at position 1 or 5.\n\nTry ""NIGHT"": N,I,G,H,T. N at position 1. Avoids C,R,A,E? I, G, H, T – yes.\n\n""NIFTY"": N,I,F,T,Y – also possible.\n\nBut ""OUIJA"" is a word but not common; avoid.\n\n""INPUT"": I,N,P,U,T – N at position 2.\n\n""MINTS"": M,I,N,T,S – N at position 3.\n\nTo cover multiple new letters: select a word with O, I, U and consonants like T,S,L.\n\nAvoid C,R,A,E.\n\n""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T – no N? But we must include N because we know it\'s in the word.\n\nWe must include N, otherwise if N isn\'t in the guess, we won\'t get info if there are other positions.\n\nIf we don\'t put N, we might miss confirming its position or presence.\n\nNo, since we know N is present, we should include it to find its position.\n\nIn this guess, include N in a new position.\n\nAlso, introduce other common letters not used or ruled out.\n\nLetters not tried: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z but avoid C,R,A,E specifically.\n\nMost common available: S, T, O, I, L, U, etc.\n\nA good word with N and these.\n\nPossible candidate: ""POINT"" but N at 4, which might not be optimal for position testing.\n\n""JOINT"": J,O,I,N,T – J is less common.\n\nBetter: ""UNLIT"" – U,N,L,I,T. N at position 2.\n\nOr ""SNAIL"" but A is ruled out. Cannot.\n\nSince A and E are out, words with O, I, U vowels.\n\nAnother idea: ""THINK"" – T,H,I,N,K. N at position 4? Position 4 is N.\n\nPosition: in ""THINK"", positions: 1-T,2-H,3-I,4-N,5-K.\n\nN at 4, same issue.\n\n""STINK"": S,T,I,N,K – N at 4.\n\nMany words have N at 4.\n\nTo avoid position 4, try words like ""SNOUT"" – S,N,O,U,T. N at 2.\n\n""CLING"" but C is out.\n\n""BLUNT"": B,L,U,N,T. N at 4? Positions:1-B,2-L,3-U,4-N,5-T. N at 4 again.\n\n""NUDGE"" has E, out.\n\n""DOWNY"" – D,O,W,N,Y. N at 4? Positions: 1-D,2-O,3-W,4-N,5-Y. N at 4.\n\nIt\'s hard to find words with N not at 4.\n\nPosition N at 1: ""NOISE"" – has E, out.\n\n""NAIVE"" – A and E out.\n\n""NOMAD"" – A out.\n\n""NOTCH"" – C out? C is ruled out.\n\n""NYMPH"" – N,Y,M,P,H.\n\n""NYMPH"" is a word: N at position 1.\n\nLetters: N,Y,M,P,H – all permissible? Y,M,P,H are allowed, since C,R,A,E are the only rules.\n\nH not ruled out.\n\nSimilarly, ""LYMPH"" is also a word, but L,Y,M,P,H.\n\nBut ""NYMPH"" is better.\n\nOr ""NIGHT"" as I thought.\n\nBut ""NYMPH"" might be obscure.\n\nBetter common words: ""KNOWN"" – has repeated N? Positions: K,N,O,W,N – N at positions 2 and 5? Repeated letters? But ""KNOWN"" has double N, but we don\'t know if secret has repeated letters, but usually it\'s better to avoid repeats for information.\n\nAssume no repeats for now.\n\n""TIMID"" – no N.\n\n""POUND"" – N at 4.\n\n""MOUNT"" – M,O,U,N,T – N at 4.\n\nWhy not place N at position 3 or 5?\n\nFor example, ""BANJO"" but A out.\n\n""PINKO"" – P,I,N,K,O – N at position 3.\n\nLetters P,I,N,K,O – all allowed? O is vowel, P,I,K,O and N.\n\nP,I,N,K,O: no C,R,A,E.\n\nK might be less common, but possible.\n\nAnother word: ""LINGO"" – L,I,N,G,O – N at 3? Positions: L,I,N,G,O – N position 3.\n\nGood.\n\n""MINTO"" might not be common.\n\n""STUNG"" – S,T,U,N,G – N at 4? Positions: S,T,U,N,G – N position 4.\n\nAlways at 4 or repeated.\n\n""USING"" – U,S,I,N,G – N at 4.\n\nPerhaps ""HINGE"" has E, out.\n\nTo have N at 5: words ending with N, like ""WINN"" not 5 letters; ""BEGIN"" has E? B,E,G,I,N – E is ruled out.\n\n""ROBIN"" has R, ruled out.\n\n""SPAIN"" has A and S,P,I,N but A out.\n\n""BRAIN"" has B,R,A,I,N – R and A out.\n\nSo hard to find words with N at end without A or E.\n\n""GIVEN"" has E.\n\n""OXBOW"" no N.\n\n""CUMIN"" has C and U,M,I,N – C ruled out.\n\n""TUMID"" – no E or A? T,U,M,I,D – no N.\n\nPerhaps ""UNPIN"" – U,N,P,I,N – repeated N, not ideal.\n\nAnother word: ""QUINT"" – Q,U,I,N,T – Q less common.\n\nBut valid.\n\nPerhaps ""POINT"" but N at 4, we can use it, and since we know N not at 4, we place it at 4 and get ""-"" again, but we also test other letters.\n\nTo save a turn and gain more info, it\'s better to move N.\n\nIdeal: ""SNAKY"" – S,N,A,K,Y but A out.\n\n""DOING"" – D,O,I,N,G – N at 4.\n\nPositions: 1-D,2-O,3-I,4-N,5-G. N at 4.\n\nBut we can accept N at a different position? Like position 1 or 2 etc.\n\nFor example, ""KNIFE"" has E and F.\n\n""WHINE"" has E.\n\n""SHINY"" – S,H,I,N,Y – N at 4? Positions: S,H,I,N,Y – N position 4.\n\nList words with N not at position 4.\n\n- Position 1: ""NOISY"" but O,I,S,Y – N at 1? ""NOISY"" has S and Y, but letters N,O,I,S,Y – O and I vowels. But position: N at 1.\n\n""NOISY"" is valid.\n\n""NUTSY"" not common.\n\n""NEWSY"" has E? N,E,W,S,Y – E ruled out.\n\n""NOXIOUS"" too long.\n\n""NASTY"" has S,T,Y but A out.\n\n""NADIR"" has A and R out.\n\n""NEIGH"" has E.\n\nSo ""NOISY"": N,O,I,S,Y – N at position 1.\n\nNo C,R,E,A.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, ""NOUNS"" – N,O,U,N,S – N at 1 and 4, repeated.\n\nBad.\n\n""LOINS"" – L,O,I,N,S – N at position 4.\n\nSo ""NOISY"" seems okay.\n\n"" TIMID"" no N.\n\nAnother option: ""UNITY"" – U,N,I,T,Y – N at position 2.\n\nU and I vowels.\n\n""UNIFY"" also valid, U,N,I,F,Y.\n\nOr ""ONION"" repeated O.\n\nAvoid.\n\nSo ""UNITY"" or ""NOISY"".\n\n""NOISY"" has S and Y, ""UNITY"" has T and Y.\n\nBoth include Y, which might be less common.\n\nBut permissible.\n\nPerhaps ""MOUNT"" but N at 4.\n\nI think ""NOISY"" or ""UNITY"" are fine.\n\nTo prioritize common letters, ""STOIC"" has C? No, C out.\n\n""POINTS"" too long.\n\nFive-letter word.\n\nAnother common word without E/A: ""PILOT"" but no N.\n\nMust include N.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""UNITY"": U,N,I,T,Y – letters U, N, I, T, Y.\n\nN is at position 2.\n\nFeedback will tell us if N is at position 2 or not.\n\nAlso test U, I, T, Y.\n\nIf U, I, T, Y are present or not.\n\nBut since no C,R,A,E, it\'s safe.\n\n""UNITY"" might be a good choice.\n\nTo avoid Y, use another word.\n\n""INPUT"": I,N,P,U,T – N at 2.\n\nSimilarly, P is less common than T in ""UNITY"".\n\nBut T is more frequent.\n\nT frequency 9.28%, P is 2.03%, so ""UNITY"" with T is better than ""INPUT"" with P.\n\n""UNITY"" has U,N,I,T,Y.\n\nY frequency is about 1.66%, low.\n\n""UNTIL"" – U,N,T,I,L – L is common.\n\n""UNTIL"" : U,N,T,I,L – positions:1-U,2-N,3-T,4-I,5-L. N at 2.\n\nL is better than Y.\n\nLetters U,N,T,I,L.\n\nFrequency: U=3.10%, N=7.23%, T=9.28%, I=7.57%, L=4.07%. Better than Y.\n\nAnd avoid C,R,A,E.\n\n""UNTIL"" is a valid English word.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSimilarly, ""LINED"" has E.\n\nSo ""UNTIL"" is better.\n\nTherefore, choose ""UNTIL"".Based on the previous feedback for ""CRANE"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x), we know:\n- Letters C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.\n- The letter N **is** in the word, but not in the 4th position (since it received ""-"" in position 4 of ""CRANE"").\n\nFor the new guess:\n- Must include the letter N (as it is present) but not in the 4th position.\n- Avoid using C, R, A, E entirely.\n- Should cover new common letters to maximize information gain.

We have the following feedback history:
- Guess 1: Invalid (not five letters) – ignored.
- Guess 2: ""CRANE"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x) → So N is present, not in pos 4; C,R,A,E absent.
- Guess 3: ""UNTIL"" -> U(x) N(-) T(x) I(x) L(-) → So U,T,I absent; N present but not pos 2; L present but not pos 5.
- Guess 4: ""LONGS"" -> L(-) O(✓) N(-) G(x) S(x) → This means:
  - L is present but not in pos 1 (since - for pos 1)
  - O is correct at position 2 (✓), so the secret word has O in the second position.
  - N is present but not in position 3 (since - for pos 3)
  - G is absent (x)
  - S is absent (x)

Compiling all information:
1. Correct letters and positions:
   - Position 2: O is correct (from LONGS feedback: O(✓))

2. Present letters (somewhere in the word, but not in guessed positions):
   - N: Known present, but not in positions 2 (from UNTIL), 3 (from LONGS), or 4 (from CRANE). So possible positions: 1 or 5.
   - L: Known present, but not in positions 1 (from LONGS: L(-)) or 5 (from UNTIL: L(-)). So possible positions: 2, 3, or 4. But position 2 is now O, so L cannot be at 2. Therefore, L must be in position 3 or 4.

3. Absent letters: C, R, A, E, U, T, I, G, S (must avoid these).

4. Known absent positions:
   - For N: positions 2, 3, 4 are ruled out → only positions 1 or 5 left.
   - For L: positions 1 and 5 ruled out → only positions 3 or 4 left (but pos 2 is taken by O).

Also, O is fixed at position 2.

Remaining letters must come from the available alphabet excluding absent letters: B, D, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc., and we know two letters are N and L.

The word structure is:
Position 1: ? (could be N here, or something else)
Position 2: O (fixed)
Position 3: ? (could be L here, or something else)
Position 4: ? (could be L here, or something else)
Position 5: ? (could be N here, or something else)

But we must have both N and L in the word.

From above:
- If N is at pos 1, then L must be at 3 or 4.
- If N is at pos 5, then L must be at 3 or 4.

Additionally, since L is at 3 or 4, and N at 1 or 5, the remaining position must be filled with a new letter not absent and not N or L.

We have three positions to fill: 1,3,4,5 but with constraints.

Actually:
- Position 1: could be N or a new letter.
- Position 3: could be L or a new letter.
- Position 4: could be L or a new letter.
- Position 5: could be N or a new letter.

But only one N and one L, so if N is at 1, then position 5 must be new letter (which cannot be L because L is at 3 or 4). Similarly if N at 5, then position 1 is new.

Similarly for L: if L at 3, then position 4 is new, etc.

But we have to cover all positions.

Now, we also know that only N and L are confirmed present, besides O at 2. But the word has 5 letters, so two more letters are unknown, which could be new, and must be from the available set.

But since we don't know how many letters are present, we can only rely on the constraints.

To make an effective guess:
- Should include N and L (since absent list grows, but they are present).
- Place N at either position 1 or 5 (allowed positions).
- Place L at either position 3 or 4 (allowed positions since 2 is taken).
- Fill other positions with high-frequency available letters: e.g., B,D,F,H,K,M,P,W,Y.

Also, avoid G,S and others absent.

Common choices: H, M, P, D, B.

Consider possibilities.

Case 1: N at position 1.
Then we need L at 3 or 4.
Also, position 5 must be a new letter.

Similarly, the position not taken by L (if L at 3, then position 4 is new; if L at 4, position 3 is new).

Case 2: N at position 5.
Then position 1 is new, L at 3 or 4, and the remaining position is new.

We can try a word that tests one of these scenarios.

Since position 2 is O, we can start the word with O at 2.

Candidates:

First, try placing N at 1 and L at 3.
Word: N _ O L _ 
Position: 1-N, 2-O, 3-L, 4-?, 5-?
But L at position 3: we don't know if it's allowed. And we need a letter for position 4 and 5. But position 5 could be something else, and position 4 must be filled.

Similarly, if L at position 3, then we have positions 4 and 5 for new letters? But we have only one letter to add? No, we need two more letters besides L and N? But O is at 2, so the word has five positions: pos1=N, pos2=O, pos3=L, then pos4 and pos5 must be two new letters.

But we must avoid absent letters.

Moreover, if we place L at 3, and if it's not correct, feedback will tell us.

Similarly, if N at 1.

So let's construct a word.

If N at 1, L at 3: then positions: 1=N, 2=O, 3=L, 4=?, 5=?.

We need two letters that are not C,R,A,E,U,T,I,G,S.

Choose common ones, e.g., D and H? ""NOLID"" but I absent? I is absent, so not.

""NOLE"" not 5 letters.

""NOULD"" U absent.

""POLED"" E absent.

With Y or B.

""NOBLY"" but L at 3? ""NOBLY"": N,O,B,L,Y → positions:1=N,2=O,3=B,4=L,5=Y → but L is at position 4, not 3. So if we want L at 3, ""NOBLY"" has L at 4.

To have L at 3: need a word like N O L _ _ 

Possible: ""NOLPT"" not a word.

""DOLLY"" has O at 2? D,O,L,L,Y – repeated L and L at position 3, but we have L at 3, but repeated?

But ""DOLLY"" has D,O,L,L,Y but positions:1=D,2=O,3=L,4=L,5=Y – repeated L.

We don't know if secret has repeated letters, but to be safe, assume single instance? But feedback hasn't indicated repeats, so perhaps avoid.

Word ""NOLAH"" not valid.

Hard to find N O L _ _ words.

Possible words: ""NOLES"" but E absent and S absent.

""POLKA"" has A and K, but A absent.

Perhaps try L at position 4 instead.

Case: N at 1, L at 4.
Then word: N O _ L _ 
Positions: 1=N, 2=O, 3=?, 4=L, 5=?

Need positions 3 and 5 filled.

With absent letters avoided.

Possible: ""NOPAL"" but A absent and P?

""NOPAL"": N,O,P,A,L – A absent, so no.

""NOBLE"" E absent.

""NOULD"" U absent.

""NOWLY"" O at 2? N,O,W,L,Y → ""NOWLY"" is a word? Meaning, occurring now? Not common, but valid? Positions:1=N,2=O,3=W,4=L,5=Y.

Letters: N,O,W,L,Y – all allowed? W,Y not absent.

Yes.

But we have L at position 4.

Similarly, ""NOWLY"" might work.

But if we choose N at 5 and L at 3.

Word: ? O L ? N, with N at 5.

For example, ""BOLON"" not a word.

""POLEN"" not.

""SOLON"" has S and O, but S absent and L? ""SOLON"": S,O,L,O,N – S absent at pos1, I at pos4? But repeated O? Positions:1=S,2=O,3=L,4=O,5=N.

But S is absent, so cannot.

""VOLON"" not.

Another option: ""DOLLN"" not.

Perhaps ""MOULN"" not.

So ""NOWLY"" with N at 1, L at 4.

But we have W and Y, less common.

Place N at position 5.

Then L at position 3 or 4.

First, L at position 3: word: ? O L ? N

Positions:1=?,2=O,3=L,4=?,5=N

Need letters for positions 1 and 4.

Not absent letters.

Possible: ""HOLPN"" not.

""BOLON"" not.

""POLAN"" A absent.

""FOLWN"" not.

""DOZLN"" not.

Difficult.

L at position 4: word: ? O ? L N

Positions:1=?,2=O,3=?,4=L,5=N

Now, positions 1 and 3 to fill.

For example, ""POLLN"" not.

""COLLN"" not.

""ROLLN"" R absent.

""BOWLN"" not standard.

""YOLK"" too short.

""YOLKN"" not a word.

Possibly ""MODEL"" but E absent.

Hard to find.

Another candidate: consider L at position 3 and N at position 5: but need a word like X O L Y N, where X and Y not absent.

For example, ""BOLIN"" but I absent.

""POLEN"" E absent.

""SOLIN"" I and S absent.

""WOLON"" not.

""WOMAN"" has A.

So perhaps it's better to have L at position 4 and N at position 1.

But in ""NOWLY"", we have it.

Another common word: ""LOINS"" but L at 1, which is now ruled out? We know L not at 1, so cannot be at pos1.

Similarly, positions matter.

Perhaps ""OVULE"" has V,U,E, U and E absent.

Not.

Let's list allowed letters: B,D,F,H,K,M,P,W,Y

And we have O at 2.

With N at 1 or 5, L at 3 or 4.

Try ""POUND"" but U absent.

""FOUND"" U absent.

""MOUND"" U absent.

""WOUND"" U absent.

""BOUND"" U absent.

All have U which is absent.

""YOND"" not 5 letters.

So ""NOWLY"" might be acceptable.

But in feedback for ""LONGS"", G and S are absent, and L and N are present but not at guessed positions.

Also, O is at pos 2 correct.

So for new guess, let's choose a word that places L in an allowed position, e.g., position 4, and N in position 1.

Candidates:
- NOWLY: N,O,W,L,Y → positions:1=N,2=O,3=W,4=L,5=Y
- BOWLY? Not a word.
- HOWLY: H,O,W,L,Y → similar, ""howly"" may not be common, but could be accepted.

But ""YOWL"" is a word, ""YOWLY"" adjective meaning howling, so valid.

Similarly, ""NOWLY"" might be less common.

Use ""NOULD"" U absent.

Another word: ""POLED"" E absent.

Perhaps ""NOBLE"" with E, absent.

So I think ""NOWLY"" is okay, but let's find a better one.

Consider L at position 3, N at position 1: word N O L _ _

With position 4 and 5: say D and H? ""NOLDH"" not.

With P: ""NOLP_"" not.

"" NOLLY"" – N,O,L,L,Y – positions: N at1, O at2, L at3, L at4, Y at5. repeated L, not ideal.

"" NOILY"" has I, absent.

So not.

Perhaps N at position 5, L at position 4.

Word: _ O _ L N

With positions 1 and 3 to fill.

Possibilities: D O K L N – ""DOKLN"" not a word.

H O M L N – ""HOMLN"" not.

B O B L N – ""BOBLN"" not.

P O P L N – ""POPLIN"" is 6 letters.

"" POPPY"" not with N.

""  ""DOWLE"" E absent.

"" JOWLY"" J,O,W,L,Y – J not frequent.

"" HOWFS"" no.

Perhaps ""YOWL"" with N, ""YOWLN"" not.

Another idea: ""COLIN"" but C and I absent.

So it's challenging.

Perhaps ""NOHOW"" O at2? N,O,H,O,W – repeated O, positions:1=N,2=O,3=H,4=O,5=W – but repeated O? And L is not included? Must have L.

So missing L.

Not.

Must include L at position 3 or 4.

So back to ""NOWLY"" or similar.

"" LOWN "" has L at 1, but L not at 1, so positions: if ""LOWN"", L at1, O at2, W at3, N at4? But N not at4, and L not at1.

So not good.

Perhaps ""OWN"" not.

Let's choose ""HOW L"" not.

"" FOWL N"" not.

So I think ""NOWLY"" is the best choice, even if it's less common.

Another word: ""DOWLY"" – D,O,W,L,Y. ""dowly"" might be archaic for dour, but it's in some dictionaries.

But let's go with what we have.

To use more common letters, place N at position 5, L at position 3.

Word: for example, ""B O L O N"" but repeated O, and O at2 is fixed, but ""BOLON"" not word.

"" H O L M N"" not.

"" P O L K N"" not.

""WOMEN"" has E.

 "" M O L D N"" D and M, but ""MOLDN"" not word.

So perhaps ""Y O L K N"" not word.

It's difficult, so let's use ""NOWLY"".

But ""YOWL"" is 4 letters.

Another common word: ""ONELY"" but E.

Or ""ONLY"" too short.

"" ""KNOW L"" not.

I think we have to use it.

Alternatively, place L at position 4, N at position 1: and use different letters.

For example, ""N O M L Y"" – ""NOMLY"" not a word.

"" N O B L Y "" – ""NOBLY"" – we considered earlier.

""NOBLY"": N,O,B, L,Y – positions: 1=N,2=O,3=B,4=L,5=Y.

Now, L at position 4: allowed (not at 5).

N at position 1: allowed (not at 2,3,4).

Letters N,O,B,L,Y – all allowed.

""NOBLY"" is a valid word, meaning in a noble manner.

Better than ""NOWLY"".

And B and Y are used.

So I'll go with ""NOBLY"".

<thinking>
- From feedback, O is fixed at position 2.
- N must be in position 1 or 5 (as positions 2,3,4 ruled out).
- L must be in position 3 or 4 (positions 1 and 5 ruled out).
- Absent letters: C,R,A,E,U,T,I,G,S.
- Chose ""NOBLY"":
  - Places N at position 1 (allowed, and tests if correct).
  - L at position 4 (allowed, and tests if correct).
  - Includes O at position 2 (already confirmed, no test needed).
  - Introduces B and Y (new letters to test).

From the feedback history:  
- **Guess 2 (CRANE):** C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x) → Absent: C, R, A, E. N present, but not in position 4.  
- **Guess 3 (UNTIL):** U(x), N(-), T(x), I(x), L(-) → Absent: U, T, I. N present, not in position 2. L present, not in position 5.  
- **Guess 4 (LONGS):** L(-), O(✓), N(-), G(x), S(x) → Absent: G, S. O is correct in position 2. L present, not in position 1. N present, not in position 3.  

**Summary of known information:**  
1. Correct position:  
   - Position 2: O (fixed).  
2. Present letters (wrong positions):  
   - **N**: Not in positions 2, 3, or 4 → only possible positions: 1 or 5.  
   - **L**: Not in positions 1 or 5 → only possible positions: 3 or 4.  
3. Absent letters: C, R, A, E, U, T, I, G, S (cannot be used).  
4. Available letters: B, D, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, and must include N and L.  
5. Word structure:

   - N must be in position 1 or 5.  
   - L must be in position 3 or 4.

**Strategy for new guess:**  
- Must include N and L (present), avoiding absent letters.  
- Place N in position 1 or 5 and L in position 3 or 4 to test allowed positions.  
- Use high-frequency available letters for new positions (e.g., B, D, H, M, P) to maximize information.  
- Chose **""NOBLY""** because:  
  - N in position 1 (untested position).  
  - L in position 4 (untested position, and position 2 already O).  
  - Introduces B and Y (high-priority unused letters).  
  - Valid English word meaning ""in a noble manner"".  
- Expectations:  
  - Tests if N is correct at position 1 and L at position 4.  
  - Feedback on B (position 3) and Y (position 5) will reveal if they are present/absent.

<guess>NOBLY</guess>",NOBLY,"We have the following feedback history:
- Guess 1: Invalid (not five letters) – ignored.
- Guess 2: ""CRANE"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x) → So N is present, not in pos 4; C,R,A,E absent.
- Guess 3: ""UNTIL"" -> U(x) N(-) T(x) I(x) L(-) → So U,T,I absent; N present but not pos 2; L present but not pos 5.
- Guess 4: ""LONGS"" -> L(-) O(✓) N(-) G(x) S(x) → This means:
  - L is present but not in pos 1 (since - for pos 1)
  - O is correct at position 2 (✓), so the secret word has O in the second position.
  - N is present but not in position 3 (since - for pos 3)
  - G is absent (x)
  - S is absent (x)

Compiling all information:
1. Correct letters and positions:
   - Position 2: O is correct (from LONGS feedback: O(✓))

2. Present letters (somewhere in the word, but not in guessed positions):
   - N: Known present, but not in positions 2 (from UNTIL), 3 (from LONGS), or 4 (from CRANE). So possible positions: 1 or 5.
   - L: Known present, but not in positions 1 (from LONGS: L(-)) or 5 (from UNTIL: L(-)). So possible positions: 2, 3, or 4. But position 2 is now O, so L cannot be at 2. Therefore, L must be in position 3 or 4.

3. Absent letters: C, R, A, E, U, T, I, G, S (must avoid these).

4. Known absent positions:
   - For N: positions 2, 3, 4 are ruled out → only positions 1 or 5 left.
   - For L: positions 1 and 5 ruled out → only positions 3 or 4 left (but pos 2 is taken by O).

Also, O is fixed at position 2.

Remaining letters must come from the available alphabet excluding absent letters: B, D, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc., and we know two letters are N and L.

The word structure is:
Position 1: ? (could be N here, or something else)
Position 2: O (fixed)
Position 3: ? (could be L here, or something else)
Position 4: ? (could be L here, or something else)
Position 5: ? (could be N here, or something else)

But we must have both N and L in the word.

From above:
- If N is at pos 1, then L must be at 3 or 4.
- If N is at pos 5, then L must be at 3 or 4.

Additionally, since L is at 3 or 4, and N at 1 or 5, the remaining position must be filled with a new letter not absent and not N or L.

We have three positions to fill: 1,3,4,5 but with constraints.

Actually:
- Position 1: could be N or a new letter.
- Position 3: could be L or a new letter.
- Position 4: could be L or a new letter.
- Position 5: could be N or a new letter.

But only one N and one L, so if N is at 1, then position 5 must be new letter (which cannot be L because L is at 3 or 4). Similarly if N at 5, then position 1 is new.

Similarly for L: if L at 3, then position 4 is new, etc.

But we have to cover all positions.

Now, we also know that only N and L are confirmed present, besides O at 2. But the word has 5 letters, so two more letters are unknown, which could be new, and must be from the available set.

But since we don't know how many letters are present, we can only rely on the constraints.

To make an effective guess:
- Should include N and L (since absent list grows, but they are present).
- Place N at either position 1 or 5 (allowed positions).
- Place L at either position 3 or 4 (allowed positions since 2 is taken).
- Fill other positions with high-frequency available letters: e.g., B,D,F,H,K,M,P,W,Y.

Also, avoid G,S and others absent.

Common choices: H, M, P, D, B.

Consider possibilities.

Case 1: N at position 1.
Then we need L at 3 or 4.
Also, position 5 must be a new letter.

Similarly, the position not taken by L (if L at 3, then position 4 is new; if L at 4, position 3 is new).

Case 2: N at position 5.
Then position 1 is new, L at 3 or 4, and the remaining position is new.

We can try a word that tests one of these scenarios.

Since position 2 is O, we can start the word with O at 2.

Candidates:

First, try placing N at 1 and L at 3.
Word: N _ O L _ 
Position: 1-N, 2-O, 3-L, 4-?, 5-?
But L at position 3: we don't know if it's allowed. And we need a letter for position 4 and 5. But position 5 could be something else, and position 4 must be filled.

Similarly, if L at position 3, then we have positions 4 and 5 for new letters? But we have only one letter to add? No, we need two more letters besides L and N? But O is at 2, so the word has five positions: pos1=N, pos2=O, pos3=L, then pos4 and pos5 must be two new letters.

But we must avoid absent letters.

Moreover, if we place L at 3, and if it's not correct, feedback will tell us.

Similarly, if N at 1.

So let's construct a word.

If N at 1, L at 3: then positions: 1=N, 2=O, 3=L, 4=?, 5=?.

We need two letters that are not C,R,A,E,U,T,I,G,S.

Choose common ones, e.g., D and H? ""NOLID"" but I absent? I is absent, so not.

""NOLE"" not 5 letters.

""NOULD"" U absent.

""POLED"" E absent.

With Y or B.

""NOBLY"" but L at 3? ""NOBLY"": N,O,B,L,Y → positions:1=N,2=O,3=B,4=L,5=Y → but L is at position 4, not 3. So if we want L at 3, ""NOBLY"" has L at 4.

To have L at 3: need a word like N O L _ _ 

Possible: ""NOLPT"" not a word.

""DOLLY"" has O at 2? D,O,L,L,Y – repeated L and L at position 3, but we have L at 3, but repeated?

But ""DOLLY"" has D,O,L,L,Y but positions:1=D,2=O,3=L,4=L,5=Y – repeated L.

We don't know if secret has repeated letters, but to be safe, assume single instance? But feedback hasn't indicated repeats, so perhaps avoid.

Word ""NOLAH"" not valid.

Hard to find N O L _ _ words.

Possible words: ""NOLES"" but E absent and S absent.

""POLKA"" has A and K, but A absent.

Perhaps try L at position 4 instead.

Case: N at 1, L at 4.
Then word: N O _ L _ 
Positions: 1=N, 2=O, 3=?, 4=L, 5=?

Need positions 3 and 5 filled.

With absent letters avoided.

Possible: ""NOPAL"" but A absent and P?

""NOPAL"": N,O,P,A,L – A absent, so no.

""NOBLE"" E absent.

""NOULD"" U absent.

""NOWLY"" O at 2? N,O,W,L,Y → ""NOWLY"" is a word? Meaning, occurring now? Not common, but valid? Positions:1=N,2=O,3=W,4=L,5=Y.

Letters: N,O,W,L,Y – all allowed? W,Y not absent.

Yes.

But we have L at position 4.

Similarly, ""NOWLY"" might work.

But if we choose N at 5 and L at 3.

Word: ? O L ? N, with N at 5.

For example, ""BOLON"" not a word.

""POLEN"" not.

""SOLON"" has S and O, but S absent and L? ""SOLON"": S,O,L,O,N – S absent at pos1, I at pos4? But repeated O? Positions:1=S,2=O,3=L,4=O,5=N.

But S is absent, so cannot.

""VOLON"" not.

Another option: ""DOLLN"" not.

Perhaps ""MOULN"" not.

So ""NOWLY"" with N at 1, L at 4.

But we have W and Y, less common.

Place N at position 5.

Then L at position 3 or 4.

First, L at position 3: word: ? O L ? N

Positions:1=?,2=O,3=L,4=?,5=N

Need letters for positions 1 and 4.

Not absent letters.

Possible: ""HOLPN"" not.

""BOLON"" not.

""POLAN"" A absent.

""FOLWN"" not.

""DOZLN"" not.

Difficult.

L at position 4: word: ? O ? L N

Positions:1=?,2=O,3=?,4=L,5=N

Now, positions 1 and 3 to fill.

For example, ""POLLN"" not.

""COLLN"" not.

""ROLLN"" R absent.

""BOWLN"" not standard.

""YOLK"" too short.

""YOLKN"" not a word.

Possibly ""MODEL"" but E absent.

Hard to find.

Another candidate: consider L at position 3 and N at position 5: but need a word like X O L Y N, where X and Y not absent.

For example, ""BOLIN"" but I absent.

""POLEN"" E absent.

""SOLIN"" I and S absent.

""WOLON"" not.

""WOMAN"" has A.

So perhaps it's better to have L at position 4 and N at position 1.

But in ""NOWLY"", we have it.

Another common word: ""LOINS"" but L at 1, which is now ruled out? We know L not at 1, so cannot be at pos1.

Similarly, positions matter.

Perhaps ""OVULE"" has V,U,E, U and E absent.

Not.

Let's list allowed letters: B,D,F,H,K,M,P,W,Y

And we have O at 2.

With N at 1 or 5, L at 3 or 4.

Try ""POUND"" but U absent.

""FOUND"" U absent.

""MOUND"" U absent.

""WOUND"" U absent.

""BOUND"" U absent.

All have U which is absent.

""YOND"" not 5 letters.

So ""NOWLY"" might be acceptable.

But in feedback for ""LONGS"", G and S are absent, and L and N are present but not at guessed positions.

Also, O is at pos 2 correct.

So for new guess, let's choose a word that places L in an allowed position, e.g., position 4, and N in position 1.

Candidates:
- NOWLY: N,O,W,L,Y → positions:1=N,2=O,3=W,4=L,5=Y
- BOWLY? Not a word.
- HOWLY: H,O,W,L,Y → similar, ""howly"" may not be common, but could be accepted.

But ""YOWL"" is a word, ""YOWLY"" adjective meaning howling, so valid.

Similarly, ""NOWLY"" might be less common.

Use ""NOULD"" U absent.

Another word: ""POLED"" E absent.

Perhaps ""NOBLE"" with E, absent.

So I think ""NOWLY"" is okay, but let's find a better one.

Consider L at position 3, N at position 1: word N O L _ _

With position 4 and 5: say D and H? ""NOLDH"" not.

With P: ""NOLP_"" not.

"" NOLLY"" – N,O,L,L,Y – positions: N at1, O at2, L at3, L at4, Y at5. repeated L, not ideal.

"" NOILY"" has I, absent.

So not.

Perhaps N at position 5, L at position 4.

Word: _ O _ L N

With positions 1 and 3 to fill.

Possibilities: D O K L N – ""DOKLN"" not a word.

H O M L N – ""HOMLN"" not.

B O B L N – ""BOBLN"" not.

P O P L N – ""POPLIN"" is 6 letters.

"" POPPY"" not with N.

""  ""DOWLE"" E absent.

"" JOWLY"" J,O,W,L,Y – J not frequent.

"" HOWFS"" no.

Perhaps ""YOWL"" with N, ""YOWLN"" not.

Another idea: ""COLIN"" but C and I absent.

So it's challenging.

Perhaps ""NOHOW"" O at2? N,O,H,O,W – repeated O, positions:1=N,2=O,3=H,4=O,5=W – but repeated O? And L is not included? Must have L.

So missing L.

Not.

Must include L at position 3 or 4.

So back to ""NOWLY"" or similar.

"" LOWN "" has L at 1, but L not at 1, so positions: if ""LOWN"", L at1, O at2, W at3, N at4? But N not at4, and L not at1.

So not good.

Perhaps ""OWN"" not.

Let's choose ""HOW L"" not.

"" FOWL N"" not.

So I think ""NOWLY"" is the best choice, even if it's less common.

Another word: ""DOWLY"" – D,O,W,L,Y. ""dowly"" might be archaic for dour, but it's in some dictionaries.

But let's go with what we have.

To use more common letters, place N at position 5, L at position 3.

Word: for example, ""B O L O N"" but repeated O, and O at2 is fixed, but ""BOLON"" not word.

"" H O L M N"" not.

"" P O L K N"" not.

""WOMEN"" has E.

 "" M O L D N"" D and M, but ""MOLDN"" not word.

So perhaps ""Y O L K N"" not word.

It's difficult, so let's use ""NOWLY"".

But ""YOWL"" is 4 letters.

Another common word: ""ONELY"" but E.

Or ""ONLY"" too short.

"" ""KNOW L"" not.

I think we have to use it.

Alternatively, place L at position 4, N at position 1: and use different letters.

For example, ""N O M L Y"" – ""NOMLY"" not a word.

"" N O B L Y "" – ""NOBLY"" – we considered earlier.

""NOBLY"": N,O,B, L,Y – positions: 1=N,2=O,3=B,4=L,5=Y.

Now, L at position 4: allowed (not at 5).

N at position 1: allowed (not at 2,3,4).

Letters N,O,B,L,Y – all allowed.

""NOBLY"" is a valid word, meaning in a noble manner.

Better than ""NOWLY"".

And B and Y are used.

So I'll go with ""NOBLY"".
