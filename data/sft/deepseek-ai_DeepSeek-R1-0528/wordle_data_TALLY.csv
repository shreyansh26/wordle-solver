We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter 'A' is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'A' and does not contain C, R, N, E.

For our next guess, we should:
1. Include the letter 'A' (since we know it's in the word) but not in the third position (because in ""crane"" it was in the third and was wrong position). However, note that the feedback doesn't tell us which position 'A' is in, only that it's not in the third. So it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
2. Avoid using the letters C, R, N, E.

We also want to maximize information by trying new common letters and covering different positions.

Let's think of a word that:
- Has 'A' in a position that is not the third (so try in position 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet (like S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.).

Possible candidates:
- We could try putting 'A' in the first position: e.g., ""ADIEU"" but note that we have to avoid E (which is in ""ADIEU"") because E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.
- We must avoid E, so let's avoid vowels that we know are not in (E is out, but we don't know about I, O, U).

Alternatively, we can try a word with 'A' in the second position.

Let me list some words without C, R, N, E and with 'A':

- ""SALAD"" -> but has two A's and two D's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but the secret word might have duplicates. However, to maximize information, we might prefer distinct letters.

But note: the feedback doesn't tell us if there are multiple same letters. So it's okay to use duplicates, but it might be less informative.

Alternatively, let's try a word with distinct letters and 'A' in a different position.

Common letters we haven't used: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, B, etc.

Try to form a word with 'A' and four new letters.

Possibilities:
- 'A' in first position: ""AUDIO"" -> uses A, U, D, I, O. All new letters. But note: we don't know if U, D, I, O are in the word. This would test four new vowels and one consonant? Actually, it's a good word for testing vowels and D.

But let's check: ""AUDIO"" has A in first position. We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in first. If we put it in first and it's not, we get a '-' for A. If it is, we get a check.

Alternatively, we can put 'A' in a position that we think is more likely? But we have no information about the position of A.

Another idea: since we know A is in the word and not in position 3, we can try to put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 to test.

But note: we have 5 positions and we know it's not in 3. So we can try position 2.

Let me think of words with A in position 2: e.g., ""PASTA"" -> but has S, T, and two A's. Also, we avoid E? P, A, S, T, A. But we don't know if P, S, T are in the word. However, we are avoiding C, R, N, E.

But ""PASTA"" has duplicate A. Let's try without duplicates: ""HABIT"" -> H, A, B, I, T. A in position 2.

Or ""DAISY"" -> but D, A, I, S, Y. However, we don't know about D, I, S, Y.

But note: we must avoid E, and also we know that the secret word has an A. So any word without C, R, N, E is acceptable.

Another candidate: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T. A in position 3? But wait, we know A is not in position 3? Actually, in the feedback for ""crane"", A was in position 3 and marked as present but wrong position. That means the secret word has an A, but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong position again? But we don't know if the word has more than one A? However, we don't have evidence of multiple A's.

To avoid wasting a position, we should try A in a different position.

So let's avoid position 3 for A.

Therefore, for the next guess, we should put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because:
- It has A in position 1 (so we test if A is in position 1).
- It uses four new letters: U, D, I, O.

But note: if the secret word has A in position 1, then we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and we know A is in the word but not in position 1.

Alternatively, we can try a word with A in position 4 or 5? That might be less common.

Another common word: ""SALET"" (a type of helmet) but it has E? We cannot use E. So avoid.

""TALON"" -> has N? We know N is not in the word. So avoid.

""MANOR"" -> has M, A, N, O, R -> but N and R are not in the word. So we cannot use N and R.

We must avoid C, R, N, E.

So let's look for words without these letters and with A.

I think ""AUDIO"" is acceptable because:
- A: we know is in the word.
- U, D, I, O: we don't know, so we test them.

But note: the word ""AUDIO"" is a valid English word.

Another option: ""ADIEU"" -> but has E, which is not allowed because E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

So ""AUDIO"" is better.

But what about ""AISLE""? -> has E and S, L, E? But E is not allowed.

We must avoid E.

So let's try to find words without E, C, R, N.

Another word: ""PLAID"" -> P, L, A, I, D. A is in position 3? But we want to avoid position 3 for A? Actually, we can try position 3 again? But we know that in the secret word, position 3 is not A. So if we put A in position 3, we will get a '-' again, which doesn't give us new information about the position of A. So it's better to try a different position.

Therefore, let's avoid position 3.

In ""PLAID"", A is in position 3, so we skip.

How about ""ALOUD"": A, L, O, U, D. A in position 1. This is similar to ""AUDIO"" but without the I and with L and O.

But ""ALOUD"" uses A, L, O, U, D.

Alternatively, ""AUDIO"" uses A, U, D, I, O.

Both are good.

I think ""AUDIO"" is a common second guess.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word has an A and we are testing four new letters.

We can also consider words that have A in the second position, such as ""PAINT"" -> but has N? N is not allowed.

""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S. A in position 2. And no forbidden letters.

Similarly, ""HASTY"" -> H, A, S, T, Y. A in position 2.

But let's compare:

- ""AUDIO"": tests A in position 1 and U, D, I, O.
- ""MAILS"": tests A in position 2 and M, I, L, S.

Both are valid.

I think I'll go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests more vowels and the consonant D.

But note: the secret word is a 5-letter word without C, R, N, E, and with A. So it might have more consonants? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has more common consonants.

Another idea: since we know A is in the word, we can try to use a word that has A and also common consonants like T, S, L, etc.

For example: ""SLATE"" -> but has E? Not allowed.

""TASTY"" -> T, A, S, T, Y -> duplicate T? And we don't know about T, S, Y.

But duplicate T might not be ideal.

""PASTA"" -> P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A? And we don't know about P, S, T.

But we are avoiding C, R, N, E.

I think ""MAILS"" is a good candidate: M, A, I, L, S. All distinct letters, A in position 2.

Similarly, ""HABIT"": H, A, B, I, T.

But let's choose one.

I'll go with ""AUDIO"" because it is a word that uses common letters and we can get a lot of information.

So next guess: ""AUDIO""

But note: if the secret word has A in position 1, then we get a check for A. If not, we get a '-' and we know A is in the word but not in position 1.

Also, we test U, D, I, O.

So let's do that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with x).
- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked with -).

For the next guess:
- Must include the letter 'A' (since it's in the secret word), but avoid placing it in the third position again to gain new positional information.
- Avoid using the letters C, R, N, E, as they are confirmed absent.
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P) to maximize information.
- Prefer a word with distinct letters to cover more possibilities.

A strong candidate is **""AUDIO""**:
- Places 'A' in position 1 (testing if 'A' is the first letter; if not, the feedback will confirm it's elsewhere).
- Introduces four new common letters: U, D, I, O.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and uses all distinct letters.

This guess will help narrow down the position of 'A' and reveal which of the new letters are present.

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter 'A' is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'A' and does not contain C, R, N, E.

For our next guess, we should:
1. Include the letter 'A' (since we know it's in the word) but not in the third position (because in ""crane"" it was in the third and was wrong position). However, note that the feedback doesn't tell us which position 'A' is in, only that it's not in the third. So it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
2. Avoid using the letters C, R, N, E.

We also want to maximize information by trying new common letters and covering different positions.

Let's think of a word that:
- Has 'A' in a position that is not the third (so try in position 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet (like S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.).

Possible candidates:
- We could try putting 'A' in the first position: e.g., ""ADIEU"" but note that we have to avoid E (which is in ""ADIEU"") because E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.
- We must avoid E, so let's avoid vowels that we know are not in (E is out, but we don't know about I, O, U).

Alternatively, we can try a word with 'A' in the second position.

Let me list some words without C, R, N, E and with 'A':

- ""SALAD"" -> but has two A's and two D's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but the secret word might have duplicates. However, to maximize information, we might prefer distinct letters.

But note: the feedback doesn't tell us if there are multiple same letters. So it's okay to use duplicates, but it might be less informative.

Alternatively, let's try a word with distinct letters and 'A' in a different position.

Common letters we haven't used: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, B, etc.

Try to form a word with 'A' and four new letters.

Possibilities:
- 'A' in first position: ""AUDIO"" -> uses A, U, D, I, O. All new letters. But note: we don't know if U, D, I, O are in the word. This would test four new vowels and one consonant? Actually, it's a good word for testing vowels and D.

But let's check: ""AUDIO"" has A in first position. We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in first. If we put it in first and it's not, we get a '-' for A. If it is, we get a check.

Alternatively, we can put 'A' in a position that we think is more likely? But we have no information about the position of A.

Another idea: since we know A is in the word and not in position 3, we can try to put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 to test.

But note: we have 5 positions and we know it's not in 3. So we can try position 2.

Let me think of words with A in position 2: e.g., ""PASTA"" -> but has S, T, and two A's. Also, we avoid E? P, A, S, T, A. But we don't know if P, S, T are in the word. However, we are avoiding C, R, N, E.

But ""PASTA"" has duplicate A. Let's try without duplicates: ""HABIT"" -> H, A, B, I, T. A in position 2.

Or ""DAISY"" -> but D, A, I, S, Y. However, we don't know about D, I, S, Y.

But note: we must avoid E, and also we know that the secret word has an A. So any word without C, R, N, E is acceptable.

Another candidate: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T. A in position 3? But wait, we know A is not in position 3? Actually, in the feedback for ""crane"", A was in position 3 and marked as present but wrong position. That means the secret word has an A, but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong position again? But we don't know if the word has more than one A? However, we don't have evidence of multiple A's.

To avoid wasting a position, we should try A in a different position.

So let's avoid position 3 for A.

Therefore, for the next guess, we should put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because:
- It has A in position 1 (so we test if A is in position 1).
- It uses four new letters: U, D, I, O.

But note: if the secret word has A in position 1, then we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and we know A is in the word but not in position 1.

Alternatively, we can try a word with A in position 4 or 5? That might be less common.

Another common word: ""SALET"" (a type of helmet) but it has E? We cannot use E. So avoid.

""TALON"" -> has N? We know N is not in the word. So avoid.

""MANOR"" -> has M, A, N, O, R -> but N and R are not in the word. So we cannot use N and R.

We must avoid C, R, N, E.

So let's look for words without these letters and with A.

I think ""AUDIO"" is acceptable because:
- A: we know is in the word.
- U, D, I, O: we don't know, so we test them.

But note: the word ""AUDIO"" is a valid English word.

Another option: ""ADIEU"" -> but has E, which is not allowed because E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

So ""AUDIO"" is better.

But what about ""AISLE""? -> has E and S, L, E? But E is not allowed.

We must avoid E.

So let's try to find words without E, C, R, N.

Another word: ""PLAID"" -> P, L, A, I, D. A is in position 3? But we want to avoid position 3 for A? Actually, we can try position 3 again? But we know that in the secret word, position 3 is not A. So if we put A in position 3, we will get a '-' again, which doesn't give us new information about the position of A. So it's better to try a different position.

Therefore, let's avoid position 3.

In ""PLAID"", A is in position 3, so we skip.

How about ""ALOUD"": A, L, O, U, D. A in position 1. This is similar to ""AUDIO"" but without the I and with L and O.

But ""ALOUD"" uses A, L, O, U, D.

Alternatively, ""AUDIO"" uses A, U, D, I, O.

Both are good.

I think ""AUDIO"" is a common second guess.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word has an A and we are testing four new letters.

We can also consider words that have A in the second position, such as ""PAINT"" -> but has N? N is not allowed.

""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S. A in position 2. And no forbidden letters.

Similarly, ""HASTY"" -> H, A, S, T, Y. A in position 2.

But let's compare:

- ""AUDIO"": tests A in position 1 and U, D, I, O.
- ""MAILS"": tests A in position 2 and M, I, L, S.

Both are valid.

I think I'll go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests more vowels and the consonant D.

But note: the secret word is a 5-letter word without C, R, N, E, and with A. So it might have more consonants? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has more common consonants.

Another idea: since we know A is in the word, we can try to use a word that has A and also common consonants like T, S, L, etc.

For example: ""SLATE"" -> but has E? Not allowed.

""TASTY"" -> T, A, S, T, Y -> duplicate T? And we don't know about T, S, Y.

But duplicate T might not be ideal.

""PASTA"" -> P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A? And we don't know about P, S, T.

But we are avoiding C, R, N, E.

I think ""MAILS"" is a good candidate: M, A, I, L, S. All distinct letters, A in position 2.

Similarly, ""HABIT"": H, A, B, I, T.

But let's choose one.

I'll go with ""AUDIO"" because it is a word that uses common letters and we can get a lot of information.

So next guess: ""AUDIO""

But note: if the secret word has A in position 1, then we get a check for A. If not, we get a '-' and we know A is in the word but not in position 1.

Also, we test U, D, I, O.

So let's do that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with x).
- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked with -).

For the next guess:
- Must include the letter 'A' (since it's in the secret word), but avoid placing it in the third position again to gain new positional information.
- Avoid using the letters C, R, N, E, as they are confirmed absent.
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P) to maximize information.
- Prefer a word with distinct letters to cover more possibilities.

A strong candidate is **""AUDIO""**:
- Places 'A' in position 1 (testing if 'A' is the first letter; if not, the feedback will confirm it's elsewhere).
- Introduces four new common letters: U, D, I, O.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and uses all distinct letters.

This guess will help narrow down the position of 'A' and reveal which of the new letters are present.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""audio"" -> Feedback: A(-), U(x), D(x), I(x), O(x)
Meaning:
- A is still not in the 1st position (since we placed it in the 1st and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not here).
- U, D, I, O are not in the word at all.

So, combining the information:
- The secret word contains the letter A, but not in position 1 or 3.
- The following letters are absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We have used 10 letters that are not in the word: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

The word must contain A, and we know it's not in position 1 or 3. So possible positions for A: 2, 4, or 5.

Now, we need to choose a new guess that:
- Includes A in one of the positions 2, 4, or 5 (to test a new position and confirm A's location).
- Uses only letters that we haven't eliminated. The eliminated letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.
- We should use common letters that we haven't tried yet, such as: S, T, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, W, Y, etc.

We also want to maximize information by covering new letters and positions.

Let's think of words that have A in position 2, 4, or 5.

First, position 2: 
- Example: _ A _ _ _

We need to fill the blanks with letters from the remaining set (avoiding C,R,N,E,U,D,I,O).

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we'll focus on common ones).

Possible words: 
- ""BASTE"" -> but E is eliminated, so no.
- ""HASTY"" -> H, A, S, T, Y -> all allowed? H, S, T, Y are not eliminated. And A in position 2.

But we don't know if H, S, T, Y are in the word. This could be a candidate.

Similarly, ""PASTA"" -> but P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A? And we don't know about P, S, T. But note: we have two A's? The feedback so far doesn't indicate multiple A's, but it's possible. However, to maximize information, we might prefer distinct letters.

But ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5. We know A is in the word, so if we put A in two positions, we might get more information about how many A's there are? But it might be less efficient.

Alternatively, ""TALON"" -> but N and O are eliminated.

""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y -> all allowed. A in position 2.

Now, position 4: 
- Example: _ _ _ A _

Words: 
- ""PLAZA"" -> but Z is less common, and two A's? Also, P, L, A, Z, A -> but Z is not common and we have two A's.
- ""FOCAL"" -> but F, O, C, A, L -> O and C are eliminated.

We need to avoid eliminated letters.

""VISTA"" -> V, I, S, T, A -> but I is eliminated (from guess 2: I(x)).

""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> N is eliminated.

So position 4 is harder.

Position 5:
- Example: _ _ _ _ A

Words:
- ""PIZZA"" -> has Z and I (eliminated) and duplicate Z.
- ""PAPA"" -> too short? Not 5 letters.
- ""TIBIA"" -> T, I, B, I, A -> I is eliminated.

""ALGAE"" -> E is eliminated.

""MANIA"" -> M, A, N, I, A -> N and I eliminated.

So position 5 also seems difficult with the eliminated letters.

Therefore, position 2 might be the easiest to try.

Let's list possible words with A in position 2 and using only the available letters.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we'll stick to common ones).

Common words:
- ""HASPS"" -> H, A, S, P, S -> duplicate S? And not a common word.
- ""BALMS"" -> B, A, L, M, S -> all distinct and common letters.
- ""HALTS"" -> H, A, L, T, S -> distinct.
- ""PALSY"" -> P, A, L, S, Y -> distinct.
- ""TALKS"" -> T, A, L, K, S -> distinct.

We can choose one of these.

But note: we also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

We have not tried: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should prioritize the most common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, M, P, H, etc.

So a word that includes several of these: e.g., ""BALMS"" has B, A, L, M, S -> letters B, L, M, S.

Alternatively, ""HALTS"" has H, A, L, T, S -> H, L, T, S.

Or ""TALKS"" has T, A, L, K, S -> T, L, K, S.

I think ""HALTS"" is a good choice because it includes H, L, T, S which are very common.

But note: we are placing A in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and we know A must be in position 4 or 5.

So let's go with ""HALTS"".

But wait, we have to consider that the word might have A in position 4 or 5. If we put A in position 2 and it's not there, we still don't know about position 4 or 5. But we will have to test that later.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has A in position 4 or 5 to test one of those. But as we saw, it's harder to find words without the eliminated letters.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven't tested (like 4 or 5) and also includes other common letters.

For example, position 4: 
- ""WASPY"" -> W, A, S, P, Y -> A in position 3? No, in ""WASPY"": W(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5) -> so A is in position 2? Not position 4.

To have A in position 4: 
- ""BESET"" -> E is eliminated.
- ""FUSED"" -> U and E eliminated.
- ""MOSSY"" -> no A.
- ""PUSHY"" -> U eliminated.

How about ""LYMPH"" -> no A.

""SYLPH"" -> no A.

""NYMPH"" -> N eliminated.

It's challenging. Let's try position 5:

- ""LLAMA"" -> L, L, A, M, A -> duplicate L and A? And we don't know about L and M. But L is available. ""LLAMA"" is a word? Yes, but it has two L's and two A's.

But we can try: ""LLAMA"" has A in position 4 and 5? Actually: positions: 1:L, 2:L, 3:A, 4:M, 5:A -> so A in 3 and 5? But we know A is not in position 3 (from first guess). So if we put A in position 3, we know it will be wrong. But we are trying to avoid position 3.

In ""LLAMA"", if we put it, the A in position 3 would be wrong (since we know A is not in position 3) and the A in position 5 might be correct or not.

But it's messy.

Alternatively, ""PAPAL"" -> P, A, P, A, L -> A in position 2 and 4? But we don't know about P and L.

But again, duplicate letters.

To keep it simple, I think it's better to test A in position 2 with a word like ""HALTS"".

We can also consider ""PASTA"", but it has two A's? ""PASTA"": P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5). So A in position 2 and 5. We know A is in the word, so if we put two A's, we might get:
- If the word has only one A, then one of the A's might be marked as '-' and the other as 'x'? But the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word, it will be marked as '-' for wrong position or '✓' for correct. If there are two A's in the guess and the word has one A, then one A might be '-' (if in a position that is not the correct one) and the other might be 'x' if that position is not the A and there's no extra A. But it's complicated.

To avoid confusion, I'll go with a word that has only one A and in position 2.

So ""HALTS"" is a good candidate: H, A, L, T, S.

We test A in position 2, and also test H, L, T, S.

If we get a '-' for A, then we know A is not in position 2 and must be in 4 or 5.

If we get a '✓' for A, then we know it's in position 2.

Also, we get feedback on H, L, T, S.

So let's choose ""HALTS"".

But note: we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""halts"" is a valid English word.

Another option: ""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y. Also good.

I think both are fine. I'll go with ""HALTS"" because it uses very common letters.

So next guess: ""HALTS""

But let's confirm the available letters: we have eliminated C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O. So H, A, L, T, S are all allowed.

Yes.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""audio"")**: A is not in position 1. U, D, I, O are absent.

### Key Insights:
- **A must be in the word** but cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from feedback). Possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O (10 letters total).
- **Available letters**: Focus on common unused consonants (e.g., S, T, L, M, P, H, B, G, K, Y) and vowels (only A is confirmed; Y may act as a vowel).
- **Strategy for next guess**:
  - Test A in a new position (position 2, 4, or 5) to narrow its location.
  - Use distinct, high-frequency letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, L, H).
  - Avoid eliminated letters entirely.

The word **""HALTS""** is chosen because:
- It places A in position 2 (testing if A is in position 2).
- It uses new common letters (H, L, T, S) that haven't been tested.
- All letters are distinct and from the available set.
- It is a valid English word.

<guess>halts</guess>",halts,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""audio"" -> Feedback: A(-), U(x), D(x), I(x), O(x)
Meaning:
- A is still not in the 1st position (since we placed it in the 1st and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not here).
- U, D, I, O are not in the word at all.

So, combining the information:
- The secret word contains the letter A, but not in position 1 or 3.
- The following letters are absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We have used 10 letters that are not in the word: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

The word must contain A, and we know it's not in position 1 or 3. So possible positions for A: 2, 4, or 5.

Now, we need to choose a new guess that:
- Includes A in one of the positions 2, 4, or 5 (to test a new position and confirm A's location).
- Uses only letters that we haven't eliminated. The eliminated letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.
- We should use common letters that we haven't tried yet, such as: S, T, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, W, Y, etc.

We also want to maximize information by covering new letters and positions.

Let's think of words that have A in position 2, 4, or 5.

First, position 2: 
- Example: _ A _ _ _

We need to fill the blanks with letters from the remaining set (avoiding C,R,N,E,U,D,I,O).

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we'll focus on common ones).

Possible words: 
- ""BASTE"" -> but E is eliminated, so no.
- ""HASTY"" -> H, A, S, T, Y -> all allowed? H, S, T, Y are not eliminated. And A in position 2.

But we don't know if H, S, T, Y are in the word. This could be a candidate.

Similarly, ""PASTA"" -> but P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A? And we don't know about P, S, T. But note: we have two A's? The feedback so far doesn't indicate multiple A's, but it's possible. However, to maximize information, we might prefer distinct letters.

But ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5. We know A is in the word, so if we put A in two positions, we might get more information about how many A's there are? But it might be less efficient.

Alternatively, ""TALON"" -> but N and O are eliminated.

""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y -> all allowed. A in position 2.

Now, position 4: 
- Example: _ _ _ A _

Words: 
- ""PLAZA"" -> but Z is less common, and two A's? Also, P, L, A, Z, A -> but Z is not common and we have two A's.
- ""FOCAL"" -> but F, O, C, A, L -> O and C are eliminated.

We need to avoid eliminated letters.

""VISTA"" -> V, I, S, T, A -> but I is eliminated (from guess 2: I(x)).

""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> N is eliminated.

So position 4 is harder.

Position 5:
- Example: _ _ _ _ A

Words:
- ""PIZZA"" -> has Z and I (eliminated) and duplicate Z.
- ""PAPA"" -> too short? Not 5 letters.
- ""TIBIA"" -> T, I, B, I, A -> I is eliminated.

""ALGAE"" -> E is eliminated.

""MANIA"" -> M, A, N, I, A -> N and I eliminated.

So position 5 also seems difficult with the eliminated letters.

Therefore, position 2 might be the easiest to try.

Let's list possible words with A in position 2 and using only the available letters.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we'll stick to common ones).

Common words:
- ""HASPS"" -> H, A, S, P, S -> duplicate S? And not a common word.
- ""BALMS"" -> B, A, L, M, S -> all distinct and common letters.
- ""HALTS"" -> H, A, L, T, S -> distinct.
- ""PALSY"" -> P, A, L, S, Y -> distinct.
- ""TALKS"" -> T, A, L, K, S -> distinct.

We can choose one of these.

But note: we also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

We have not tried: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should prioritize the most common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, M, P, H, etc.

So a word that includes several of these: e.g., ""BALMS"" has B, A, L, M, S -> letters B, L, M, S.

Alternatively, ""HALTS"" has H, A, L, T, S -> H, L, T, S.

Or ""TALKS"" has T, A, L, K, S -> T, L, K, S.

I think ""HALTS"" is a good choice because it includes H, L, T, S which are very common.

But note: we are placing A in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and we know A must be in position 4 or 5.

So let's go with ""HALTS"".

But wait, we have to consider that the word might have A in position 4 or 5. If we put A in position 2 and it's not there, we still don't know about position 4 or 5. But we will have to test that later.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has A in position 4 or 5 to test one of those. But as we saw, it's harder to find words without the eliminated letters.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven't tested (like 4 or 5) and also includes other common letters.

For example, position 4: 
- ""WASPY"" -> W, A, S, P, Y -> A in position 3? No, in ""WASPY"": W(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5) -> so A is in position 2? Not position 4.

To have A in position 4: 
- ""BESET"" -> E is eliminated.
- ""FUSED"" -> U and E eliminated.
- ""MOSSY"" -> no A.
- ""PUSHY"" -> U eliminated.

How about ""LYMPH"" -> no A.

""SYLPH"" -> no A.

""NYMPH"" -> N eliminated.

It's challenging. Let's try position 5:

- ""LLAMA"" -> L, L, A, M, A -> duplicate L and A? And we don't know about L and M. But L is available. ""LLAMA"" is a word? Yes, but it has two L's and two A's.

But we can try: ""LLAMA"" has A in position 4 and 5? Actually: positions: 1:L, 2:L, 3:A, 4:M, 5:A -> so A in 3 and 5? But we know A is not in position 3 (from first guess). So if we put A in position 3, we know it will be wrong. But we are trying to avoid position 3.

In ""LLAMA"", if we put it, the A in position 3 would be wrong (since we know A is not in position 3) and the A in position 5 might be correct or not.

But it's messy.

Alternatively, ""PAPAL"" -> P, A, P, A, L -> A in position 2 and 4? But we don't know about P and L.

But again, duplicate letters.

To keep it simple, I think it's better to test A in position 2 with a word like ""HALTS"".

We can also consider ""PASTA"", but it has two A's? ""PASTA"": P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5). So A in position 2 and 5. We know A is in the word, so if we put two A's, we might get:
- If the word has only one A, then one of the A's might be marked as '-' and the other as 'x'? But the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word, it will be marked as '-' for wrong position or '✓' for correct. If there are two A's in the guess and the word has one A, then one A might be '-' (if in a position that is not the correct one) and the other might be 'x' if that position is not the A and there's no extra A. But it's complicated.

To avoid confusion, I'll go with a word that has only one A and in position 2.

So ""HALTS"" is a good candidate: H, A, L, T, S.

We test A in position 2, and also test H, L, T, S.

If we get a '-' for A, then we know A is not in position 2 and must be in 4 or 5.

If we get a '✓' for A, then we know it's in position 2.

Also, we get feedback on H, L, T, S.

So let's choose ""HALTS"".

But note: we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""halts"" is a valid English word.

Another option: ""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y. Also good.

I think both are fine. I'll go with ""HALTS"" because it uses very common letters.

So next guess: ""HALTS""

But let's confirm the available letters: we have eliminated C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O. So H, A, L, T, S are all allowed.

Yes.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""audio"")**: A is not in position 1. U, D, I, O are absent.

### Key Insights:
- **A must be in the word** but cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from feedback). Possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O (10 letters total).

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word that covers 5 common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and none are repeated.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter 'A' is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'A' and does not contain C, R, N, E.

For our next guess, we should:
1. Include the letter 'A' (since we know it's in the word) but not in the third position (because in ""crane"" it was in the third and was wrong position). However, note that the feedback doesn't tell us which position 'A' is in, only that it's not in the third. So it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
2. Avoid using the letters C, R, N, E.

We also want to maximize information by trying new common letters and covering different positions.

Let's think of a word that:
- Has 'A' in a position that is not the third (so try in position 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet (like S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.).

Possible candidates:
- We could try putting 'A' in the first position: e.g., ""ADIEU"" but note that we have to avoid E (which is in ""ADIEU"") because E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.
- We must avoid E, so let's avoid vowels that we know are not in (E is out, but we don't know about I, O, U).

Alternatively, we can try a word with 'A' in the second position.

Let me list some words without C, R, N, E and with 'A':

- ""SALAD"" -> but has two A's and two D's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but the secret word might have duplicates. However, to maximize information, we might prefer distinct letters.

But note: the feedback doesn't tell us if there are multiple same letters. So it's okay to use duplicates, but it might be less informative.

Alternatively, let's try a word with distinct letters and 'A' in a different position.

Common letters we haven't used: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, B, etc.

Try to form a word with 'A' and four new letters.

Possibilities:
- 'A' in first position: ""AUDIO"" -> uses A, U, D, I, O. All new letters. But note: we don't know if U, D, I, O are in the word. This would test four new vowels and one consonant? Actually, it's a good word for testing vowels and D.

But let's check: ""AUDIO"" has A in first position. We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in first. If we put it in first and it's not, we get a '-' for A. If it is, we get a check.

Alternatively, we can put 'A' in a position that we think is more likely? But we have no information about the position of A.

Another idea: since we know A is in the word and not in position 3, we can try to put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 to test.

But note: we have 5 positions and we know it's not in 3. So we can try position 2.

Let me think of words with A in position 2: e.g., ""PASTA"" -> but has S, T, and two A's. Also, we avoid E? P, A, S, T, A. But we don't know if P, S, T are in the word. However, we are avoiding C, R, N, E.

But ""PASTA"" has duplicate A. Let's try without duplicates: ""HABIT"" -> H, A, B, I, T. A in position 2.

Or ""DAISY"" -> but D, A, I, S, Y. However, we don't know about D, I, S, Y.

But note: we must avoid E, and also we know that the secret word has an A. So any word without C, R, N, E is acceptable.

Another candidate: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T. A in position 3? But wait, we know A is not in position 3? Actually, in the feedback for ""crane"", A was in position 3 and marked as present but wrong position. That means the secret word has an A, but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong position again? But we don't know if the word has more than one A? However, we don't have evidence of multiple A's.

To avoid wasting a position, we should try A in a different position.

So let's avoid position 3 for A.

Therefore, for the next guess, we should put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because:
- It has A in position 1 (so we test if A is in position 1).
- It uses four new letters: U, D, I, O.

But note: if the secret word has A in position 1, then we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and we know A is in the word but not in position 1.

Alternatively, we can try a word with A in position 4 or 5? That might be less common.

Another common word: ""SALET"" (a type of helmet) but it has E? We cannot use E. So avoid.

""TALON"" -> has N? We know N is not in the word. So avoid.

""MANOR"" -> has M, A, N, O, R -> but N and R are not in the word. So we cannot use N and R.

We must avoid C, R, N, E.

So let's look for words without these letters and with A.

I think ""AUDIO"" is acceptable because:
- A: we know is in the word.
- U, D, I, O: we don't know, so we test them.

But note: the word ""AUDIO"" is a valid English word.

Another option: ""ADIEU"" -> but has E, which is not allowed because E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

So ""AUDIO"" is better.

But what about ""AISLE""? -> has E and S, L, E? But E is not allowed.

We must avoid E.

So let's try to find words without E, C, R, N.

Another word: ""PLAID"" -> P, L, A, I, D. A is in position 3? But we want to avoid position 3 for A? Actually, we can try position 3 again? But we know that in the secret word, position 3 is not A. So if we put A in position 3, we will get a '-' again, which doesn't give us new information about the position of A. So it's better to try a different position.

Therefore, let's avoid position 3.

In ""PLAID"", A is in position 3, so we skip.

How about ""ALOUD"": A, L, O, U, D. A in position 1. This is similar to ""AUDIO"" but without the I and with L and O.

But ""ALOUD"" uses A, L, O, U, D.

Alternatively, ""AUDIO"" uses A, U, D, I, O.

Both are good.

I think ""AUDIO"" is a common second guess.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word has an A and we are testing four new letters.

We can also consider words that have A in the second position, such as ""PAINT"" -> but has N? N is not allowed.

""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S. A in position 2. And no forbidden letters.

Similarly, ""HASTY"" -> H, A, S, T, Y. A in position 2.

But let's compare:

- ""AUDIO"": tests A in position 1 and U, D, I, O.
- ""MAILS"": tests A in position 2 and M, I, L, S.

Both are valid.

I think I'll go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests more vowels and the consonant D.

But note: the secret word is a 5-letter word without C, R, N, E, and with A. So it might have more consonants? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has more common consonants.

Another idea: since we know A is in the word, we can try to use a word that has A and also common consonants like T, S, L, etc.

For example: ""SLATE"" -> but has E? Not allowed.

""TASTY"" -> T, A, S, T, Y -> duplicate T? And we don't know about T, S, Y.

But duplicate T might not be ideal.

""PASTA"" -> P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A? And we don't know about P, S, T.

But we are avoiding C, R, N, E.

I think ""MAILS"" is a good candidate: M, A, I, L, S. All distinct letters, A in position 2.

Similarly, ""HABIT"": H, A, B, I, T.

But let's choose one.

I'll go with ""AUDIO"" because it is a word that uses common letters and we can get a lot of information.

So next guess: ""AUDIO""

But note: if the secret word has A in position 1, then we get a check for A. If not, we get a '-' and we know A is in the word but not in position 1.

Also, we test U, D, I, O.

So let's do that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with x).
- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked with -).

For the next guess:
- Must include the letter 'A' (since it's in the secret word), but avoid placing it in the third position again to gain new positional information.
- Avoid using the letters C, R, N, E, as they are confirmed absent.
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P) to maximize information.
- Prefer a word with distinct letters to cover more possibilities.

A strong candidate is **""AUDIO""**:
- Places 'A' in position 1 (testing if 'A' is the first letter; if not, the feedback will confirm it's elsewhere).
- Introduces four new common letters: U, D, I, O.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and uses all distinct letters.

This guess will help narrow down the position of 'A' and reveal which of the new letters are present.

So, combining the information:
- The secret word contains the letter A, but not in position 1 or 3.
- The following letters are absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We have used 10 letters that are not in the word: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

The word must contain A, and we know it's not in position 1 or 3. So possible positions for A: 2, 4, or 5.

Now, we need to choose a new guess that:
- Includes A in one of the positions 2, 4, or 5 (to test a new position and confirm A's location).
- Uses only letters that we haven't eliminated. The eliminated letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.
- We should use common letters that we haven't tried yet, such as: S, T, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, W, Y, etc.

We also want to maximize information by covering new letters and positions.

Let's think of words that have A in position 2, 4, or 5.

First, position 2: 
- Example: _ A _ _ _

We need to fill the blanks with letters from the remaining set (avoiding C,R,N,E,U,D,I,O).

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we'll focus on common ones).

Possible words: 
- ""BASTE"" -> but E is eliminated, so no.
- ""HASTY"" -> H, A, S, T, Y -> all allowed? H, S, T, Y are not eliminated. And A in position 2.

But we don't know if H, S, T, Y are in the word. This could be a candidate.

Similarly, ""PASTA"" -> but P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A? And we don't know about P, S, T. But note: we have two A's? The feedback so far doesn't indicate multiple A's, but it's possible. However, to maximize information, we might prefer distinct letters.

But ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5. We know A is in the word, so if we put A in two positions, we might get more information about how many A's there are? But it might be less efficient.

Alternatively, ""TALON"" -> but N and O are eliminated.

""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y -> all allowed. A in position 2.

Now, position 4: 
- Example: _ _ _ A _

Words: 
- ""PLAZA"" -> but Z is less common, and two A's? Also, P, L, A, Z, A -> but Z is not common and we have two A's.
- ""FOCAL"" -> but F, O, C, A, L -> O and C are eliminated.

We need to avoid eliminated letters.

""VISTA"" -> V, I, S, T, A -> but I is eliminated (from guess 2: I(x)).

""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> N is eliminated.

So position 4 is harder.

Position 5:
- Example: _ _ _ _ A

Words:
- ""PIZZA"" -> has Z and I (eliminated) and duplicate Z.
- ""PAPA"" -> too short? Not 5 letters.
- ""TIBIA"" -> T, I, B, I, A -> I is eliminated.

""ALGAE"" -> E is eliminated.

""MANIA"" -> M, A, N, I, A -> N and I eliminated.

So position 5 also seems difficult with the eliminated letters.

Therefore, position 2 might be the easiest to try.

Let's list possible words with A in position 2 and using only the available letters.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we'll stick to common ones).

Common words:
- ""HASPS"" -> H, A, S, P, S -> duplicate S? And not a common word.
- ""BALMS"" -> B, A, L, M, S -> all distinct and common letters.
- ""HALTS"" -> H, A, L, T, S -> distinct.
- ""PALSY"" -> P, A, L, S, Y -> distinct.
- ""TALKS"" -> T, A, L, K, S -> distinct.

We can choose one of these.

But note: we also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

We have not tried: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should prioritize the most common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, M, P, H, etc.

So a word that includes several of these: e.g., ""BALMS"" has B, A, L, M, S -> letters B, L, M, S.

Alternatively, ""HALTS"" has H, A, L, T, S -> H, L, T, S.

Or ""TALKS"" has T, A, L, K, S -> T, L, K, S.

I think ""HALTS"" is a good choice because it includes H, L, T, S which are very common.

But note: we are placing A in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and we know A must be in position 4 or 5.

So let's go with ""HALTS"".

But wait, we have to consider that the word might have A in position 4 or 5. If we put A in position 2 and it's not there, we still don't know about position 4 or 5. But we will have to test that later.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has A in position 4 or 5 to test one of those. But as we saw, it's harder to find words without the eliminated letters.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven't tested (like 4 or 5) and also includes other common letters.

For example, position 4: 
- ""WASPY"" -> W, A, S, P, Y -> A in position 3? No, in ""WASPY"": W(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5) -> so A is in position 2? Not position 4.

To have A in position 4: 
- ""BESET"" -> E is eliminated.
- ""FUSED"" -> U and E eliminated.
- ""MOSSY"" -> no A.
- ""PUSHY"" -> U eliminated.

How about ""LYMPH"" -> no A.

""SYLPH"" -> no A.

""NYMPH"" -> N eliminated.

It's challenging. Let's try position 5:

- ""LLAMA"" -> L, L, A, M, A -> duplicate L and A? And we don't know about L and M. But L is available. ""LLAMA"" is a word? Yes, but it has two L's and two A's.

But we can try: ""LLAMA"" has A in position 4 and 5? Actually: positions: 1:L, 2:L, 3:A, 4:M, 5:A -> so A in 3 and 5? But we know A is not in position 3 (from first guess). So if we put A in position 3, we know it will be wrong. But we are trying to avoid position 3.

In ""LLAMA"", if we put it, the A in position 3 would be wrong (since we know A is not in position 3) and the A in position 5 might be correct or not.

But it's messy.

Alternatively, ""PAPAL"" -> P, A, P, A, L -> A in position 2 and 4? But we don't know about P and L.

But again, duplicate letters.

To keep it simple, I think it's better to test A in position 2 with a word like ""HALTS"".

We can also consider ""PASTA"", but it has two A's? ""PASTA"": P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5). So A in position 2 and 5. We know A is in the word, so if we put two A's, we might get:
- If the word has only one A, then one of the A's might be marked as '-' and the other as 'x'? But the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word, it will be marked as '-' for wrong position or '✓' for correct. If there are two A's in the guess and the word has one A, then one A might be '-' (if in a position that is not the correct one) and the other might be 'x' if that position is not the A and there's no extra A. But it's complicated.

To avoid confusion, I'll go with a word that has only one A and in position 2.

So ""HALTS"" is a good candidate: H, A, L, T, S.

We test A in position 2, and also test H, L, T, S.

If we get a '-' for A, then we know A is not in position 2 and must be in 4 or 5.

If we get a '✓' for A, then we know it's in position 2.

Also, we get feedback on H, L, T, S.

So let's choose ""HALTS"".

But note: we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""halts"" is a valid English word.

Another option: ""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y. Also good.

I think both are fine. I'll go with ""HALTS"" because it uses very common letters.

So next guess: ""HALTS""

But let's confirm the available letters: we have eliminated C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O. So H, A, L, T, S are all allowed.

Yes.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""audio"")**: A is not in position 1. U, D, I, O are absent.

### Key Insights:
- **A must be in the word** but cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from feedback). Possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O (10 letters total).
- **Available letters**: Focus on common unused consonants (e.g., S, T, L, M, P, H, B, G, K, Y) and vowels (only A is confirmed; Y may act as a vowel).
- **Strategy for next guess**:
  - Test A in a new position (position 2, 4, or 5) to narrow its location.
  - Use distinct, high-frequency letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, L, H).
  - Avoid eliminated letters entirely.

The word **""HALTS""** is chosen because:
- It places A in position 2 (testing if A is in position 2).
- It uses new common letters (H, L, T, S) that haven't been tested.
- All letters are distinct and from the available set.
- It is a valid English word.

Avoid using the letters C, R, N, E.\n\nWe also want to maximize information by trying new common letters and covering different positions.\n\nLet\'s think of a word that:\n- Has \'A\' in a position that is not the third (so try in position 1, 2, 4, or 5).\n- Uses other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet (like S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.).\n\nPossible candidates:\n- We could try putting \'A\' in the first position: e.g., ""ADIEU"" but note that we have to avoid E (which is in ""ADIEU"") because E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.\n- We must avoid E, so let\'s avoid vowels that we know are not in (E is out, but we don\'t know about I, O, U).\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word with \'A\' in the second position.\n\nLet me list some words without C, R, N, E and with \'A\':\n\n- ""SALAD"" -> but has two A\'s and two D\'s?

However, to maximize information, we might prefer distinct letters.\n\nBut note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us if there are multiple same letters. So it\'s okay to use duplicates, but it might be less informative.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s try a word with distinct letters and \'A\' in a different position.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t used: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, B, etc.\n\nTry to form a word with \'A\' and four new letters.\n\nPossibilities:\n- \'A\' in first position: ""AUDIO"" -> uses A, U, D, I, O. All new letters. But note: we don\'t know if U, D, I, O are in the word. This would test four new vowels and one consonant? Actually, it\'s a good word for testing vowels and D.\n\nBut let\'s check: ""AUDIO"" has A in first position. We know A is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s in first. If we put it in first and it\'s not, we get a \'-\' for A. If it is, we get a check.\n\nAlternatively, we can put \'A\' in a position that we think is more likely? But we have no information about the position of A.\n\nAnother idea: since we know A is in the word and not in position 3, we can try to put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 to test.\n\nBut note: we have 5 positions and we know it\'s not in 3. So we can try position 2.\n\nLet me think of words with A in position 2: e.g., ""PASTA"" -> but has S, T, and two A\'s. Also, we avoid E? P, A, S, T, A. But we don\'t know if P, S, T are in the word. However, we are avoiding C, R, N, E.\n\nBut ""PASTA"" has duplicate A. Let\'s try without duplicates: ""HABIT"" -> H, A, B, I, T. A in position 2.\n\nOr ""DAISY"" -> but D, A, I, S, Y. However, we don\'t know about D, I, S, Y.\n\nBut note: we must avoid E, and also we know that the secret word has an A. So any word without C, R, N, E is acceptable.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T. A in position 3? But wait, we know A is not in position 3? Actually, in the feedback for ""crane"", A was in position 3 and marked as present but wrong position. That means the secret word has an A, but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong position again? But we don\'t know if the word has more than one A? However, we don\'t have evidence of multiple A\'s.\n\nTo avoid wasting a position, we should try A in a different position.\n\nSo let\'s avoid position 3 for A.\n\nTherefore, for the next guess, we should put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nI think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because:\n- It has A in position 1 (so we test if A is in position 1).\n- It uses four new letters: U, D, I, O.\n\nBut note: if the secret word has A in position 1, then we get a check. If not, we get a \'-\' and we know A is in the word but not in position 1.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word with A in position 4 or 5? That might be less common.\n\nAnother common word: ""SALET"" (a type of helmet) but it has E? We cannot use E. So avoid.\n\n""TALON"" -> has N? We know N is not in the word. So avoid.\n\n""MANOR"" -> has M, A, N, O, R -> but N and R are not in the word. So we cannot use N and R.\n\nWe must avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nSo let\'s look for words without these letters and with A.\n\nI think ""AUDIO"" is acceptable because:\n- A: we know is in the word.\n- U, D, I, O: we don\'t know, so we test them.\n\nBut note: the word ""AUDIO"" is a valid English word.\n\nAnother option: ""ADIEU"" -> but has E, which is not allowed because E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.\n\nSo ""AUDIO"" is better.\n\nBut what about ""AISLE""? -> has E and S, L, E? But E is not allowed.\n\nWe must avoid E.\n\nSo let\'s try to find words without E, C, R, N.\n\nAnother word: ""PLAID"" -> P, L, A, I, D. A is in position 3? But we want to avoid position 3 for A? Actually, we can try position 3 again? But we know that in the secret word, position 3 is not A. So if we put A in position 3, we will get a \'-\' again, which doesn\'t give us new information about the position of A. So it\'s better to try a different position.\n\nTherefore, let\'s avoid position 3.\n\nIn ""PLAID"", A is in position 3, so we skip.\n\nHow about ""ALOUD"": A, L, O, U, D. A in position 1. This is similar to ""AUDIO"" but without the I and with L and O.\n\nBut ""ALOUD"" uses A, L, O, U, D.\n\nAlternatively, ""AUDIO"" uses A, U, D, I, O.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nI think ""AUDIO"" is a common second guess.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the secret word has an A and we are testing four new letters.\n\nWe can also consider words that have A in the second position, such as ""PAINT"" -> but has N? N is not allowed.\n\n""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S. A in position 2. And no forbidden letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""HASTY"" -> H, A, S, T, Y. A in position 2.\n\nBut let\'s compare:\n\n- ""AUDIO"": tests A in position 1 and U, D, I, O.\n- ""MAILS"": tests A in position 2 and M, I, L, S.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests more vowels and the consonant D.\n\nBut note: the secret word is a 5-letter word without C, R, N, E, and with A. So it might have more consonants? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has more common consonants.\n\nAnother idea: since we know A is in the word, we can try to use a word that has A and also common consonants like T, S, L, etc.\n\nFor example: ""SLATE"" -> but has E? Not allowed.\n\n""TASTY"" -> T, A, S, T, Y -> duplicate T? And we don\'t know about T, S, Y.\n\nBut duplicate T might not be ideal.\n\n""PASTA"" -> P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A? And we don\'t know about P, S, T.\n\nBut we are avoiding C, R, N, E.\n\nI think ""MAILS"" is a good candidate: M, A, I, L, S. All distinct letters, A in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""HABIT"": H, A, B, I, T.\n\nBut let\'s choose one.\n\nI\'ll go with ""AUDIO"" because it is a word that uses common letters and we can get a lot of information.\n\nSo next guess: ""AUDIO""\n\nBut note: if the secret word has A in position 1, then we get a check for A. If not, we get a \'-\' and we know A is in the word but not in position 1.\n\nAlso, we test U, D, I, O.\n\nSo let\'s do that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with x).\n- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked with -).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include the letter \'A\' (since it\'s in the secret word), but avoid placing it in the third position again to gain new positional information.\n- Avoid using the letters C, R, N, E, as they are confirmed absent.\n- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P) to maximize information.\n- Prefer a word with distinct letters to cover more possibilities.\n\nA strong candidate is **""AUDIO""**:\n- Places \'A\' in position 1 (testing if \'A\' is the first letter; if not, the feedback will confirm it\'s elsewhere).\n- Introduces four new common letters: U, D, I, O.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and uses all distinct letters.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of \'A\' and reveal which of the new letters are present.\n\n<guess>audio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)\nMeaning:\n- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.\n- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.\n\nGuess 2: ""audio"" -> Feedback: A(-), U(x), D(x), I(x), O(x)\nMeaning:\n- A is still not in the 1st position (since we placed it in the 1st and got \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not here).\n- U, D, I, O are not in the word at all.\n\nSo, combining the information:\n- The secret word contains the letter A, but not in position 1 or 3.\n- The following letters are absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.\n\nWe have used 10 letters that are not in the word: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.\n\nThe word must contain A, and we know it\'s not in position 1 or 3.

However, to maximize information, we might prefer distinct letters.\n\nBut ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5. We know A is in the word, so if we put A in two positions, we might get more information about how many A\'s there are? But it might be less efficient.\n\nAlternatively, ""TALON"" -> but N and O are eliminated.\n\n""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y -> all allowed. A in position 2.\n\nNow, position 4: \n- Example: _ _ _ A _\n\nWords: \n- ""PLAZA"" -> but Z is less common, and two A\'s? Also, P, L, A, Z, A -> but Z is not common and we have two A\'s.\n- ""FOCAL"" -> but F, O, C, A, L -> O and C are eliminated.\n\nWe need to avoid eliminated letters.\n\n""VISTA"" -> V, I, S, T, A -> but I is eliminated (from guess 2: I(x)).\n\n""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> N is eliminated.\n\nSo position 4 is harder.\n\nPosition 5:\n- Example: _ _ _ _ A\n\nWords:\n- ""PIZZA"" -> has Z and I (eliminated) and duplicate Z.\n- ""PAPA"" -> too short?

Let\'s try position 5:\n\n- ""LLAMA"" -> L, L, A, M, A -> duplicate L and A? And we don\'t know about L and M. But L is available. ""LLAMA"" is a word? Yes, but it has two L\'s and two A\'s.\n\nBut we can try: ""LLAMA"" has A in position 4 and 5? Actually: positions: 1:L, 2:L, 3:A, 4:M, 5:A -> so A in 3 and 5? But we know A is not in position 3 (from first guess). So if we put A in position 3, we know it will be wrong. But we are trying to avoid position 3.\n\nIn ""LLAMA"", if we put it, the A in position 3 would be wrong (since we know A is not in position 3) and the A in position 5 might be correct or not.\n\nBut it\'s messy.\n\nAlternatively, ""PAPAL"" -> P, A, P, A, L -> A in position 2 and 4? But we don\'t know about P and L.\n\nBut again, duplicate letters.\n\nTo keep it simple, I think it\'s better to test A in position 2 with a word like ""HALTS"".\n\nWe can also consider ""PASTA"", but it has two A\'s? ""PASTA"": P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5). So A in position 2 and 5. We know A is in the word, so if we put two A\'s, we might get:\n- If the word has only one A, then one of the A\'s might be marked as \'-\' and the other as \'x\'? But the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word, it will be marked as \'-\' for wrong position or \'✓\' for correct. If there are two A\'s in the guess and the word has one A, then one A might be \'-\' (if in a position that is not the correct one) and the other might be \'x\' if that position is not the A and there\'s no extra A. But it\'s complicated.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I\'ll go with a word that has only one A and in position 2.\n\nSo ""HALTS"" is a good candidate: H, A, L, T, S.\n\nWe test A in position 2, and also test H, L, T, S.\n\nIf we get a \'-\' for A, then we know A is not in position 2 and must be in 4 or 5.\n\nIf we get a \'✓\' for A, then we know it\'s in position 2.\n\nAlso, we get feedback on H, L, T, S.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""HALTS"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure it\'s a valid word. Yes, ""halts"" is a valid English word.\n\nAnother option: ""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y. Also good.\n\nI think both are fine. I\'ll go with ""HALTS"" because it uses very common letters.\n\nSo next guess: ""HALTS""\n\nBut let\'s confirm the available letters: we have eliminated C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O. So H, A, L, T, S are all allowed.\n\nYes.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (""audio"")**: A is not in position 1. U, D, I, O are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **A must be in the word** but cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from feedback). Possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.\n- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O (10 letters total).\n- **Available letters**: Focus on common unused consonants (e.g., S, T, L, M, P, H, B, G, K, Y) and vowels (only A is confirmed; Y may act as a vowel).\n- **Strategy for next guess**:\n  - Test A in a new position (position 2, 4, or 5) to narrow its location.\n  - Use distinct, high-frequency letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, L, H).\n  - Avoid eliminated letters entirely.\n\nThe word **""HALTS""** is chosen because:\n- It places A in position 2 (testing if A is in position 2).\n- It uses new common letters (H, L, T, S) that haven\'t been tested.\n- All letters are distinct and from the available set.\n- It is a valid English word.\n\n<guess>halts</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)\nGuess 3: halts -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) L(✓) T(-) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
  - A is present but not in position 3.
  - C, R, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: ""audio"" -> A(-), U(x), D(x), I(x), O(x)
  - A is present but not in position 1.
  - U, D, I, O are absent.

Guess 3: ""halts"" -> H(x), A(✓), L(✓), T(-), S(x)
  - A is correct in position 2 (✓).
  - L is correct in position 3 (✓).
  - T is present but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 and marked as -).
  - H and S are absent.

So, combining all the information:

1. The secret word has A in position 2 and L in position 3. So the word is _ A L _ _.

2. T is in the word, but not in position 4 (and not in position 2 or 3, since those are filled). Possible positions for T are 1, 4, or 5? But position 4 was tested and was wrong, so T cannot be in position 4. Therefore, T must be in position 1 or 5.

Also, note that positions:
- Position 1: unknown, but T might be here? Or another letter.
- Position 4: unknown, but T cannot be here because in ""halts"" T was in position 4 and marked as wrong position.
- Position 5: unknown, T might be here.

3. Absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S. And from previous, so total absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ A L _ _, with:
- Letters that must be present: T (somewhere, not in position 4).
- And possibly other letters we haven't eliminated.

Available letters: We have to use letters not eliminated. Eliminated letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.

So available letters: A is already placed, so for the other positions we need letters from: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. And T is one of the letters that must be included.

But T is in the word, and it must be in position 1 or 5.

Now, the word is _ A L _ _

Also, we haven't tested many letters, so we need to include T and one more letter (since two blanks: positions 1 and 5? Actually, position 4 is also blank? Wait, no: the word has positions 1, 4, and 5 to fill? Positions:
- Position 1: unknown
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 3: L (fixed)
- Position 4: unknown
- Position 5: unknown

But we have two constraints:
- T must be in the word and is not in position 4. So T must be in position 1 or 5.
- The secret word might have other letters from the available set.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits:
- Starts with: [letter] then A, then L, then [letter], then [letter]
- T must be in the word, so either position 1 or 5. And cannot be in position 4? Actually, position 4 cannot have T because it was marked wrong there. Similarly, positions 2 and 3 are A and L, so T must be in 1 or 5.

Additionally, position 4 must be filled with a letter that is not T and not any eliminated letter.

So possible structures:
- If T is in position 1: T A L _ _ 
- If T is in position 5: _ A L _ T

Now, we need to choose a word that satisfies one of these and uses available letters.

Let's list possible words.

First, if T is in position 1: T A L _ _

Possible letters for positions 4 and 5: from available: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we must form a valid English word.

Possible words: 
- ""TALKY"" -> T, A, L, K, Y -> positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:L, 4:K, 5:Y. But we have feedback that in guess 3 ""halts"", the T was marked as present but wrong position (position 4). However, in ""TALKY"", T is in position 1, which is fine. But we need to check if K and Y are available. They are not eliminated. Also, note that in ""halts"", the T was in position 4: if in the secret word T is in position 1, then when we guessed ""halts"" (which had T in position 4), the feedback would mark T as '-' because it is present but not in the correct position. That matches the feedback (T was marked as '-'). So possible.

But is ""TALKY"" a word? Yes, meaning talkative.

Other possibilities:
- ""TALKS"" -> T, A, L, K, S -> but S is eliminated (from guess 3: S(x)). So S cannot be used.
- ""TALLY"" -> T, A, L, L, Y -> duplicate L? And L is fixed in position 3. But here, we have L in position 3 and another L? The feedback hasn't indicated if L is duplicated. However, if the secret word has two L's, it would be fine. But ""TALLY"" has L in position 4? Position 4 is L, but in the secret word, position 3 is L. So if we have ""TALLY"", it would be T A L L Y -> positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y. Then in the secret word, if it has L at position 3 and another at position 4, then when we guessed ""halts"" (which had L at position 3, correct, and no L elsewhere?), but we had only one L in ""halts"". In ""halts"", we had L at position 3 (which was correct) and no other L. So if the secret word has two L's, we don't know.

But we don't have evidence against it. However, ""TALLY"" might not be the best because we are duplicating L when we haven't tested for duplicates.

Similarly, ""TALKY"" is acceptable.

But we also have the option with T in position 5: _ A L _ T

Then positions: 1: ?, 2:A, 3:L, 4:?, 5:T

Possible words:
- ""WALTZ"" -> W, A, L, T, Z? Wait, positions: 1:W, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:Z. But in this case, T is in position 4? Then in the feedback from guess 3 (""halts""), we had T in position 4 marked as wrong. But if the secret word has T in position 4, then when we guessed ""halts"" we should have gotten a ✓ for T in position 4? Because it would be the correct position. But the feedback was T(-), meaning wrong position. So if T were in position 4, it would have been marked ✓. Therefore, T cannot be in position 4.

In the structure _ A L _ T, if T is at position 5, then position 4 is not T. So for example, ""BALMY"" -> but position 5 is Y? Not T.

What are words ending with T? Like ""EXALT"" -> but E and X? E is eliminated.

""FINAL"" -> not ending with T, and N eliminated.

So for _ A L _ T:

Possible options:
- ""MALTY"" -> M, A, L, T, Y? But then positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:Y? But we cannot have T in position 4 because then in ""halts"" it should be ✓. Contradiction.

Therefore, T cannot be in position 4. And we already know it must be in 1 or 5. In the structure _ A L _ _, the position 4 cannot have T.

So the structure with T at position 5 is: _ A L _ T, where the blank at position 4 must be a letter that is not T.

Similarly, for position 1, it can be T or another letter. But T must be in the word, so if not at position 1, then at position 5.

Therefore, we have two cases:

Case 1: T at position 1: T A L _ _

Case 2: T at position 5: _ A L _ T

Now, let's list possible words for each case.

Case 1: T A L _ _

Fill positions 4 and 5 with available letters.

Possible words:
- ""TALKY"" (as above)
- ""TALKS"" -> but S eliminated
- ""TALLY"" -> T A L L Y -> positions 4:L? So we have L at position 3 and 4? That is possible. But we don't know if L is duplicated. Also, ""TALLY"" might be less common? But it is valid.
- ""TALAX"" ? Not a word.
- ""TALPA"" ? Not a word.
- ""TALMA"" ? Not common.
- ""TAMLY"" ? Not a word.

So ""TALKY"" and ""TALLY"" are possible.

Case 2: _ A L _ T

Position 1: a letter from available set, not T? Actually, position 1 could be T if we miss, but we are assuming case 2 has T at position 5, so position 1 should not be T, otherwise we would have two T's? No, T must be at position 1 or 5, so if at position 5, position 1 is not T.

So position 1: from available letters: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Position 4: similarly, available letters, but not T.

Possible words:
- ""BALKT"" ? Not a word.
- ""VALTZ"" ? Not a word.
- ""WALTZ"" -> W, A, L, T, Z -> but then T is in position 4? Positions: 1:W, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:Z → but we cannot have T at position 4 (as reasoned above) because it would contradict the feedback.
- ""MALT"" is 4 letters.
- ""MALTY"" -> M, A, L, T, Y → positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:Y → same issue: T at position 4.

But position 4 cannot be T! Otherwise, in ""halts"" it would have been marked as correct.

Therefore, we cannot have a word that has T at position 4. Hence, in case 2, we need a word ending with T and without T at position 4. So position 4 must be a non-T letter.

But is there any word like _ A L _ T? For example, ""EXALT"" has E (eliminated). ""FAL$T"" not a word. ""GALT"" not 5 letters.

Common words:
- ""HALFT"" ? Not a word.
- ""SALET"" -> S is eliminated and E eliminated.
- ""BALOT"" -> B, A, L, O, T → O is eliminated.

All appear to be invalid or using eliminated letters.

Therefore, case 2 might be extremely unlikely.

So case 1 is much more probable: T A L _ _

Now, position 4 and 5 must be filled with letters from available: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and not S, which is eliminated).

Possible words:
- ""TALKY"" → T, A, L, K, Y
- ""TALK"" is 4 letters.
- ""TALLY"" → T, A, L, L, Y
- ""TAMLY"" ? Not a word.
- ""TALPA"" ? Not common.
- ""TALAK"" ? Not common.

""TALKY"" and ""TALLY"" are the main candidates.

Moreover, we need to account for the feedback that T is present but not in position 4. In both words, T is in position 1, so that is fine. Position 4 would be K in ""TALKY"" or L in ""TALLY"".

Now, we need to choose between them. Alternatively, we can guess one of them to test.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we are on guess 4.

Another idea: we can guess a word that reuses some information but if possible, not fix T at position 1? But the structure requires T at 1 or 5.

Since case 2 seems hard, we'll go with case 1.

But is there a word with T at position 5? Let me try harder.

Possible words ending with T: ""EXALT"" → E eliminated.
""  A L   T"" → ""FALST"" ? Not a word.
""PALET"" → P, A, L, E, T → E eliminated, and if we ignore E, but E is not allowed.
""VALID"" → V, A, L, I, D → I and D eliminated? D and I from guess 2.

""VAULT"" → V, A, U, L, T → U eliminated.

It seems impossible to have a word with T at position 5 without using eliminated letters.

Therefore, the only possibility is T at position 1: T A L _ _

So the secret word is T A L _ _

Now, for positions 4 and 5, we consider the remaining letters.

We have two candidates: ""TALKY"" and ""TALLY"".

We can guess one of them.

To decide, note that in ""halts"", we used S, and it was absent. But in ""TALLY"", we have Y, which is not tested. Similarly, in ""TALKY"", we have K and Y, not tested.

Also, we haven't tested Y or K before.

Now, if we guess ""TALLY"", and if the secret word is ""TALKY"", we might get incorrect, but we can try.

Alternatively, we can think about the presence of duplicate letters: if we guess ""TALLY"" and the secret word has only one L, then position 4 (L) would be marked 'x'? But we have L at position 3 (correct) and position 4 L might be extra.

But based on feedback rules: if the secret word has only one L, then the L at position 3 is correct (✓), and the L at position 4 would be marked 'x' if there is no second L.

Similarly, if the secret word has two L's, then both L's would be accounted.

But we don't know.

However, guessing ""TALLY"" might not be as informative because we reuse L.

Therefore, perhaps ""TALKY"" is a better guess because it uses K and Y, new letters.

Moreover, ""TALKY"" is one of the possible words.

So let's choose ""TALKY"".

If we are wrong, we have tries left.

Thus, we guess ""TALKY"".

But note: is there another word? What about ""TALMI"" (like talmi gold)? But I is eliminated. So no.

So ""TALKY"" is a valid choice.

We guess ""TALKY"". 

And hope that positions 4 and 5 are K and Y.
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A is in the word but not in position 3, and C, R, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""audio"")**: A is not in position 1, and U, D, I, O are absent.
- **Guess 3 (""halts"")**: A is correct in position 2, L is correct in position 3, T is present but not in position 4, and H, S are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed positions**: 
   - Position 2 is A (✓ from ""halts"").
   - Position 3 is L (✓ from ""halts"").
   - The word pattern is: `_ A L _ _`.
   
2. **Present letters**: 
   - A (fixed at position 2).
   - L (fixed at position 3).
   - T is confirmed present but cannot be in position 4 (since it was misplaced in ""halts""). Thus, T must be in position 1 or 5.

3. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S (10 letters eliminated).

4. **Remaining available letters**: Focus on untested common letters from B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus T.

5. **Strategy for Guess 4**:
   - Fill positions 1, 4, and 5 with available letters.
   - T must appear (in position 1 or 5).
   - Test new high-frequency consonants/vowels (e.g., K, Y) to identify the missing letters.
   - The word **""TALKY""** fits the pattern:
     - Position 1: T (tests if T belongs here).
     - Position 4: K (new letter).
     - Position 5: Y (new letter).
   - It uses distinct, untested letters and adheres to the feedback constraints.

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)

2. T is in the word, but not in position 4 (and not in position 2 or 3, since those are filled). Possible positions for T are 1, 4, or 5? But position 4 was tested and was wrong, so T cannot be in position 4. Therefore, T must be in position 1 or 5.

Also, note that positions:
- Position 1: unknown, but T might be here? Or another letter.
- Position 4: unknown, but T cannot be here because in ""halts"" T was in position 4 and marked as wrong position.
- Position 5: unknown, T might be here.

3. Absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S. And from previous, so total absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ A L _ _, with:
- Letters that must be present: T (somewhere, not in position 4).
- And possibly other letters we haven't eliminated.

Available letters: We have to use letters not eliminated. Eliminated letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.

But T is in the word, and it must be in position 1 or 5.

Now, the word is _ A L _ _

Also, we haven't tested many letters, so we need to include T and one more letter (since two blanks: positions 1 and 5? Actually, position 4 is also blank? Wait, no: the word has positions 1, 4, and 5 to fill? Positions:

But we have two constraints:

- If T is in position 5: _ A L _ T

Now, we need to choose a word that satisfies one of these and uses available letters.

Let's list possible words.

First, if T is in position 1: T A L _ _

Possible letters for positions 4 and 5: from available: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we must form a valid English word.

Possible words: 
- ""TALKY"" -> T, A, L, K, Y -> positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:L, 4:K, 5:Y. But we have feedback that in guess 3 ""halts"", the T was marked as present but wrong position (position 4). However, in ""TALKY"", T is in position 1, which is fine. But we need to check if K and Y are available. They are not eliminated. Also, note that in ""halts"", the T was in position 4: if in the secret word T is in position 1, then when we guessed ""halts"" (which had T in position 4), the feedback would mark T as '-' because it is present but not in the correct position. That matches the feedback (T was marked as '-'). So possible.

But is ""TALKY"" a word? Yes, meaning talkative.

Other possibilities:
- ""TALKS"" -> T, A, L, K, S -> but S is eliminated (from guess 3: S(x)). So S cannot be used.
- ""TALLY"" -> T, A, L, L, Y -> duplicate L? And L is fixed in position 3. But here, we have L in position 3 and another L? The feedback hasn't indicated if L is duplicated. However, if the secret word has two L's, it would be fine. But ""TALLY"" has L in position 4? Position 4 is L, but in the secret word, position 3 is L. So if we have ""TALLY"", it would be T A L L Y -> positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y. Then in the secret word, if it has L at position 3 and another at position 4, then when we guessed ""halts"" (which had L at position 3, correct, and no L elsewhere?), but we had only one L in ""halts"". In ""halts"", we had L at position 3 (which was correct) and no other L. So if the secret word has two L's, we don't know.

But we don't have evidence against it. However, ""TALLY"" might not be the best because we are duplicating L when we haven't tested for duplicates.

Similarly, ""TALKY"" is acceptable.

But we also have the option with T in position 5: _ A L _ T

Then positions: 1: ?, 2:A, 3:L, 4:?, 5:T

Possible words:
- ""WALTZ"" -> W, A, L, T, Z? Wait, positions: 1:W, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:Z. But in this case, T is in position 4? Then in the feedback from guess 3 (""halts""), we had T in position 4 marked as wrong. But if the secret word has T in position 4, then when we guessed ""halts"" we should have gotten a ✓ for T in position 4? Because it would be the correct position. But the feedback was T(-), meaning wrong position. So if T were in position 4, it would have been marked ✓. Therefore, T cannot be in position 4.

In the structure _ A L _ T, if T is at position 5, then position 4 is not T. So for example, ""BALMY"" -> but position 5 is Y? Not T.

What are words ending with T? Like ""EXALT"" -> but E and X? E is eliminated.

""FINAL"" -> not ending with T, and N eliminated.

So for _ A L _ T:

Possible options:
- ""MALTY"" -> M, A, L, T, Y? But then positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:Y? But we cannot have T in position 4 because then in ""halts"" it should be ✓. Contradiction.

Therefore, T cannot be in position 4. And we already know it must be in 1 or 5. In the structure _ A L _ _, the position 4 cannot have T.

So the structure with T at position 5 is: _ A L _ T, where the blank at position 4 must be a letter that is not T.

Similarly, for position 1, it can be T or another letter. But T must be in the word, so if not at position 1, then at position 5.

Therefore, we have two cases:

Case 1: T at position 1: T A L _ _

Case 2: T at position 5: _ A L _ T

Now, let's list possible words for each case.

Case 1: T A L _ _

Fill positions 4 and 5 with available letters.

Possible words:
- ""TALKY"" (as above)
- ""TALKS"" -> but S eliminated
- ""TALLY"" -> T A L L Y -> positions 4:L? So we have L at position 3 and 4? That is possible. But we don't know if L is duplicated. Also, ""TALLY"" might be less common? But it is valid.
- ""TALAX"" ? Not a word.
- ""TALPA"" ? Not a word.
- ""TALMA"" ? Not common.
- ""TAMLY"" ? Not a word.

So ""TALKY"" and ""TALLY"" are possible.

Case 2: _ A L _ T

Position 1: a letter from available set, not T? Actually, position 1 could be T if we miss, but we are assuming case 2 has T at position 5, so position 1 should not be T, otherwise we would have two T's? No, T must be at position 1 or 5, so if at position 5, position 1 is not T.

So position 1: from available letters: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Position 4: similarly, available letters, but not T.

Possible words:
- ""BALKT"" ? Not a word.
- ""VALTZ"" ? Not a word.
- ""WALTZ"" -> W, A, L, T, Z -> but then T is in position 4? Positions: 1:W, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:Z → but we cannot have T at position 4 (as reasoned above) because it would contradict the feedback.
- ""MALT"" is 4 letters.
- ""MALTY"" -> M, A, L, T, Y → positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:Y → same issue: T at position 4.

But position 4 cannot be T! Otherwise, in ""halts"" it would have been marked as correct.

Therefore, we cannot have a word that has T at position 4. Hence, in case 2, we need a word ending with T and without T at position 4. So position 4 must be a non-T letter.

But is there any word like _ A L _ T? For example, ""EXALT"" has E (eliminated). ""FAL$T"" not a word. ""GALT"" not 5 letters.

Common words:
- ""HALFT"" ? Not a word.
- ""SALET"" -> S is eliminated and E eliminated.
- ""BALOT"" -> B, A, L, O, T → O is eliminated.

All appear to be invalid or using eliminated letters.

Therefore, case 2 might be extremely unlikely.

So case 1 is much more probable: T A L _ _

Now, position 4 and 5 must be filled with letters from available: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and not S, which is eliminated).

Possible words:
- ""TALKY"" → T, A, L, K, Y
- ""TALK"" is 4 letters.
- ""TALLY"" → T, A, L, L, Y
- ""TAMLY"" ? Not a word.
- ""TALPA"" ? Not common.
- ""TALAK"" ? Not common.

""TALKY"" and ""TALLY"" are the main candidates.

Moreover, we need to account for the feedback that T is present but not in position 4. In both words, T is in position 1, so that is fine. Position 4 would be K in ""TALKY"" or L in ""TALLY"".

Now, we need to choose between them. Alternatively, we can guess one of them to test.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we are on guess 4.

Another idea: we can guess a word that reuses some information but if possible, not fix T at position 1? But the structure requires T at 1 or 5.

Since case 2 seems hard, we'll go with case 1.

But is there a word with T at position 5? Let me try harder.

Possible words ending with T: ""EXALT"" → E eliminated.
""  A L   T"" → ""FALST"" ? Not a word.
""PALET"" → P, A, L, E, T → E eliminated, and if we ignore E, but E is not allowed.
""VALID"" → V, A, L, I, D → I and D eliminated? D and I from guess 2.

""VAULT"" → V, A, U, L, T → U eliminated.

It seems impossible to have a word with T at position 5 without using eliminated letters.

Therefore, the only possibility is T at position 1: T A L _ _

So the secret word is T A L _ _

Now, for positions 4 and 5, we consider the remaining letters.

We have two candidates: ""TALKY"" and ""TALLY"".

We can guess one of them.

To decide, note that in ""halts"", we used S, and it was absent. But in ""TALLY"", we have Y, which is not tested. Similarly, in ""TALKY"", we have K and Y, not tested.

Also, we haven't tested Y or K before.

Now, if we guess ""TALLY"", and if the secret word is ""TALKY"", we might get incorrect, but we can try.

Alternatively, we can think about the presence of duplicate letters: if we guess ""TALLY"" and the secret word has only one L, then position 4 (L) would be marked 'x'? But we have L at position 3 (correct) and position 4 L might be extra.

But based on feedback rules: if the secret word has only one L, then the L at position 3 is correct (✓), and the L at position 4 would be marked 'x' if there is no second L.

Similarly, if the secret word has two L's, then both L's would be accounted.

But we don't know.

However, guessing ""TALLY"" might not be as informative because we reuse L.

Therefore, perhaps ""TALKY"" is a better guess because it uses K and Y, new letters.

Moreover, ""TALKY"" is one of the possible words.

So let's choose ""TALKY"".

If we are wrong, we have tries left.

Thus, we guess ""TALKY"".

But note: is there another word? What about ""TALMI"" (like talmi gold)? But I is eliminated. So no.

So ""TALKY"" is a valid choice.

We guess ""TALKY"". 

And hope that positions 4 and 5 are K and Y.After analyzing the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A is in the word but not in position 3, and C, R, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""audio"")**: A is not in position 1, and U, D, I, O are absent.
- **Guess 3 (""halts"")**: A is correct in position 2, L is correct in position 3, T is present but not in position 4, and H, S are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed positions**: 
   - Position 2 is A (✓ from ""halts"").
   - Position 3 is L (✓ from ""halts"").
   - The word pattern is: `_ A L _ _`.
   
2. **Present letters**: 
   - A (fixed at position 2).
   - L (fixed at position 3).
   - T is confirmed present but cannot be in position 4 (since it was misplaced in ""halts""). Thus, T must be in position 1 or 5.

3. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S (10 letters eliminated).

4. **Remaining available letters**: Focus on untested common letters from B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus T.

5. **Strategy for Guess 4**:
   - Fill positions 1, 4, and 5 with available letters.
   - T must appear (in position 1 or 5).
   - Test new high-frequency consonants/vowels (e.g., K, Y) to identify the missing letters.
   - The word **""TALKY""** fits the pattern:
     - Position 1: T (tests if T belongs here).
     - Position 4: K (new letter).
     - Position 5: Y (new letter).
   - It uses distinct, untested letters and adheres to the feedback constraints.",Guess 4: talky -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) L(✓) K(x) Y(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word that covers 5 common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and none are repeated.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter 'A' is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'A' and does not contain C, R, N, E.

For our next guess, we should:
1. Include the letter 'A' (since we know it's in the word) but not in the third position (because in ""crane"" it was in the third and was wrong position). However, note that the feedback doesn't tell us which position 'A' is in, only that it's not in the third. So it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
2. Avoid using the letters C, R, N, E.

We also want to maximize information by trying new common letters and covering different positions.

Let's think of a word that:
- Has 'A' in a position that is not the third (so try in position 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet (like S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.).

Possible candidates:
- We could try putting 'A' in the first position: e.g., ""ADIEU"" but note that we have to avoid E (which is in ""ADIEU"") because E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.
- We must avoid E, so let's avoid vowels that we know are not in (E is out, but we don't know about I, O, U).

Alternatively, we can try a word with 'A' in the second position.

Let me list some words without C, R, N, E and with 'A':

- ""SALAD"" -> but has two A's and two D's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but the secret word might have duplicates. However, to maximize information, we might prefer distinct letters.

But note: the feedback doesn't tell us if there are multiple same letters. So it's okay to use duplicates, but it might be less informative.

Alternatively, let's try a word with distinct letters and 'A' in a different position.

Common letters we haven't used: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, B, etc.

Try to form a word with 'A' and four new letters.

Possibilities:
- 'A' in first position: ""AUDIO"" -> uses A, U, D, I, O. All new letters. But note: we don't know if U, D, I, O are in the word. This would test four new vowels and one consonant? Actually, it's a good word for testing vowels and D.

But let's check: ""AUDIO"" has A in first position. We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in first. If we put it in first and it's not, we get a '-' for A. If it is, we get a check.

Alternatively, we can put 'A' in a position that we think is more likely? But we have no information about the position of A.

Another idea: since we know A is in the word and not in position 3, we can try to put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 to test.

But note: we have 5 positions and we know it's not in 3. So we can try position 2.

Let me think of words with A in position 2: e.g., ""PASTA"" -> but has S, T, and two A's. Also, we avoid E? P, A, S, T, A. But we don't know if P, S, T are in the word. However, we are avoiding C, R, N, E.

But ""PASTA"" has duplicate A. Let's try without duplicates: ""HABIT"" -> H, A, B, I, T. A in position 2.

Or ""DAISY"" -> but D, A, I, S, Y. However, we don't know about D, I, S, Y.

But note: we must avoid E, and also we know that the secret word has an A. So any word without C, R, N, E is acceptable.

Another candidate: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T. A in position 3? But wait, we know A is not in position 3? Actually, in the feedback for ""crane"", A was in position 3 and marked as present but wrong position. That means the secret word has an A, but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong position again? But we don't know if the word has more than one A? However, we don't have evidence of multiple A's.

To avoid wasting a position, we should try A in a different position.

So let's avoid position 3 for A.

Therefore, for the next guess, we should put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because:
- It has A in position 1 (so we test if A is in position 1).
- It uses four new letters: U, D, I, O.

But note: if the secret word has A in position 1, then we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and we know A is in the word but not in position 1.

Alternatively, we can try a word with A in position 4 or 5? That might be less common.

Another common word: ""SALET"" (a type of helmet) but it has E? We cannot use E. So avoid.

""TALON"" -> has N? We know N is not in the word. So avoid.

""MANOR"" -> has M, A, N, O, R -> but N and R are not in the word. So we cannot use N and R.

We must avoid C, R, N, E.

So let's look for words without these letters and with A.

I think ""AUDIO"" is acceptable because:
- A: we know is in the word.
- U, D, I, O: we don't know, so we test them.

But note: the word ""AUDIO"" is a valid English word.

Another option: ""ADIEU"" -> but has E, which is not allowed because E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

So ""AUDIO"" is better.

But what about ""AISLE""? -> has E and S, L, E? But E is not allowed.

We must avoid E.

So let's try to find words without E, C, R, N.

Another word: ""PLAID"" -> P, L, A, I, D. A is in position 3? But we want to avoid position 3 for A? Actually, we can try position 3 again? But we know that in the secret word, position 3 is not A. So if we put A in position 3, we will get a '-' again, which doesn't give us new information about the position of A. So it's better to try a different position.

Therefore, let's avoid position 3.

In ""PLAID"", A is in position 3, so we skip.

How about ""ALOUD"": A, L, O, U, D. A in position 1. This is similar to ""AUDIO"" but without the I and with L and O.

But ""ALOUD"" uses A, L, O, U, D.

Alternatively, ""AUDIO"" uses A, U, D, I, O.

Both are good.

I think ""AUDIO"" is a common second guess.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word has an A and we are testing four new letters.

We can also consider words that have A in the second position, such as ""PAINT"" -> but has N? N is not allowed.

""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S. A in position 2. And no forbidden letters.

Similarly, ""HASTY"" -> H, A, S, T, Y. A in position 2.

But let's compare:

- ""AUDIO"": tests A in position 1 and U, D, I, O.
- ""MAILS"": tests A in position 2 and M, I, L, S.

Both are valid.

I think I'll go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests more vowels and the consonant D.

But note: the secret word is a 5-letter word without C, R, N, E, and with A. So it might have more consonants? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has more common consonants.

Another idea: since we know A is in the word, we can try to use a word that has A and also common consonants like T, S, L, etc.

For example: ""SLATE"" -> but has E? Not allowed.

""TASTY"" -> T, A, S, T, Y -> duplicate T? And we don't know about T, S, Y.

But duplicate T might not be ideal.

""PASTA"" -> P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A? And we don't know about P, S, T.

But we are avoiding C, R, N, E.

I think ""MAILS"" is a good candidate: M, A, I, L, S. All distinct letters, A in position 2.

Similarly, ""HABIT"": H, A, B, I, T.

But let's choose one.

I'll go with ""AUDIO"" because it is a word that uses common letters and we can get a lot of information.

So next guess: ""AUDIO""

But note: if the secret word has A in position 1, then we get a check for A. If not, we get a '-' and we know A is in the word but not in position 1.

Also, we test U, D, I, O.

So let's do that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with x).
- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked with -).

For the next guess:
- Must include the letter 'A' (since it's in the secret word), but avoid placing it in the third position again to gain new positional information.
- Avoid using the letters C, R, N, E, as they are confirmed absent.
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P) to maximize information.
- Prefer a word with distinct letters to cover more possibilities.

A strong candidate is **""AUDIO""**:
- Places 'A' in position 1 (testing if 'A' is the first letter; if not, the feedback will confirm it's elsewhere).
- Introduces four new common letters: U, D, I, O.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and uses all distinct letters.

This guess will help narrow down the position of 'A' and reveal which of the new letters are present.

<guess>audio</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""audio"" -> Feedback: A(-), U(x), D(x), I(x), O(x)
Meaning:
- A is still not in the 1st position (since we placed it in the 1st and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not here).
- U, D, I, O are not in the word at all.

So, combining the information:
- The secret word contains the letter A, but not in position 1 or 3.
- The following letters are absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We have used 10 letters that are not in the word: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

The word must contain A, and we know it's not in position 1 or 3. So possible positions for A: 2, 4, or 5.

Now, we need to choose a new guess that:
- Includes A in one of the positions 2, 4, or 5 (to test a new position and confirm A's location).
- Uses only letters that we haven't eliminated. The eliminated letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.
- We should use common letters that we haven't tried yet, such as: S, T, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, W, Y, etc.

We also want to maximize information by covering new letters and positions.

Let's think of words that have A in position 2, 4, or 5.

First, position 2: 
- Example: _ A _ _ _

We need to fill the blanks with letters from the remaining set (avoiding C,R,N,E,U,D,I,O).

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we'll focus on common ones).

Possible words: 
- ""BASTE"" -> but E is eliminated, so no.
- ""HASTY"" -> H, A, S, T, Y -> all allowed? H, S, T, Y are not eliminated. And A in position 2.

But we don't know if H, S, T, Y are in the word. This could be a candidate.

Similarly, ""PASTA"" -> but P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A? And we don't know about P, S, T. But note: we have two A's? The feedback so far doesn't indicate multiple A's, but it's possible. However, to maximize information, we might prefer distinct letters.

But ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5. We know A is in the word, so if we put A in two positions, we might get more information about how many A's there are? But it might be less efficient.

Alternatively, ""TALON"" -> but N and O are eliminated.

""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y -> all allowed. A in position 2.

Now, position 4: 
- Example: _ _ _ A _

Words: 
- ""PLAZA"" -> but Z is less common, and two A's? Also, P, L, A, Z, A -> but Z is not common and we have two A's.
- ""FOCAL"" -> but F, O, C, A, L -> O and C are eliminated.

We need to avoid eliminated letters.

""VISTA"" -> V, I, S, T, A -> but I is eliminated (from guess 2: I(x)).

""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> N is eliminated.

So position 4 is harder.

Position 5:
- Example: _ _ _ _ A

Words:
- ""PIZZA"" -> has Z and I (eliminated) and duplicate Z.
- ""PAPA"" -> too short? Not 5 letters.
- ""TIBIA"" -> T, I, B, I, A -> I is eliminated.

""ALGAE"" -> E is eliminated.

""MANIA"" -> M, A, N, I, A -> N and I eliminated.

So position 5 also seems difficult with the eliminated letters.

Therefore, position 2 might be the easiest to try.

Let's list possible words with A in position 2 and using only the available letters.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we'll stick to common ones).

Common words:
- ""HASPS"" -> H, A, S, P, S -> duplicate S? And not a common word.
- ""BALMS"" -> B, A, L, M, S -> all distinct and common letters.
- ""HALTS"" -> H, A, L, T, S -> distinct.
- ""PALSY"" -> P, A, L, S, Y -> distinct.
- ""TALKS"" -> T, A, L, K, S -> distinct.

We can choose one of these.

But note: we also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

We have not tried: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should prioritize the most common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, M, P, H, etc.

So a word that includes several of these: e.g., ""BALMS"" has B, A, L, M, S -> letters B, L, M, S.

Alternatively, ""HALTS"" has H, A, L, T, S -> H, L, T, S.

Or ""TALKS"" has T, A, L, K, S -> T, L, K, S.

I think ""HALTS"" is a good choice because it includes H, L, T, S which are very common.

But note: we are placing A in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and we know A must be in position 4 or 5.

So let's go with ""HALTS"".

But wait, we have to consider that the word might have A in position 4 or 5. If we put A in position 2 and it's not there, we still don't know about position 4 or 5. But we will have to test that later.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has A in position 4 or 5 to test one of those. But as we saw, it's harder to find words without the eliminated letters.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven't tested (like 4 or 5) and also includes other common letters.

For example, position 4: 
- ""WASPY"" -> W, A, S, P, Y -> A in position 3? No, in ""WASPY"": W(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5) -> so A is in position 2? Not position 4.

To have A in position 4: 
- ""BESET"" -> E is eliminated.
- ""FUSED"" -> U and E eliminated.
- ""MOSSY"" -> no A.
- ""PUSHY"" -> U eliminated.

How about ""LYMPH"" -> no A.

""SYLPH"" -> no A.

""NYMPH"" -> N eliminated.

It's challenging. Let's try position 5:

- ""LLAMA"" -> L, L, A, M, A -> duplicate L and A? And we don't know about L and M. But L is available. ""LLAMA"" is a word? Yes, but it has two L's and two A's.

But we can try: ""LLAMA"" has A in position 4 and 5? Actually: positions: 1:L, 2:L, 3:A, 4:M, 5:A -> so A in 3 and 5? But we know A is not in position 3 (from first guess). So if we put A in position 3, we know it will be wrong. But we are trying to avoid position 3.

In ""LLAMA"", if we put it, the A in position 3 would be wrong (since we know A is not in position 3) and the A in position 5 might be correct or not.

But it's messy.

Alternatively, ""PAPAL"" -> P, A, P, A, L -> A in position 2 and 4? But we don't know about P and L.

But again, duplicate letters.

To keep it simple, I think it's better to test A in position 2 with a word like ""HALTS"".

We can also consider ""PASTA"", but it has two A's? ""PASTA"": P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5). So A in position 2 and 5. We know A is in the word, so if we put two A's, we might get:
- If the word has only one A, then one of the A's might be marked as '-' and the other as 'x'? But the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word, it will be marked as '-' for wrong position or '✓' for correct. If there are two A's in the guess and the word has one A, then one A might be '-' (if in a position that is not the correct one) and the other might be 'x' if that position is not the A and there's no extra A. But it's complicated.

To avoid confusion, I'll go with a word that has only one A and in position 2.

So ""HALTS"" is a good candidate: H, A, L, T, S.

We test A in position 2, and also test H, L, T, S.

If we get a '-' for A, then we know A is not in position 2 and must be in 4 or 5.

If we get a '✓' for A, then we know it's in position 2.

Also, we get feedback on H, L, T, S.

So let's choose ""HALTS"".

But note: we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""halts"" is a valid English word.

Another option: ""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y. Also good.

I think both are fine. I'll go with ""HALTS"" because it uses very common letters.

So next guess: ""HALTS""

But let's confirm the available letters: we have eliminated C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O. So H, A, L, T, S are all allowed.

Yes.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""audio"")**: A is not in position 1. U, D, I, O are absent.

- **A must be in the word** but cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from feedback). Possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O (10 letters total).
- **Available letters**: Focus on common unused consonants (e.g., S, T, L, M, P, H, B, G, K, Y) and vowels (only A is confirmed; Y may act as a vowel).
- **Strategy for next guess**:
  - Test A in a new position (position 2, 4, or 5) to narrow its location.
  - Use distinct, high-frequency letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, L, H).
  - Avoid eliminated letters entirely.

The word **""HALTS""** is chosen because:
- It places A in position 2 (testing if A is in position 2).
- It uses new common letters (H, L, T, S) that haven't been tested.
- All letters are distinct and from the available set.
- It is a valid English word.

<guess>halts</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)
Guess 3: halts -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) L(✓) T(-) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
  - A is present but not in position 3.
  - C, R, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: ""audio"" -> A(-), U(x), D(x), I(x), O(x)
  - A is present but not in position 1.
  - U, D, I, O are absent.

Guess 3: ""halts"" -> H(x), A(✓), L(✓), T(-), S(x)
  - A is correct in position 2 (✓).
  - L is correct in position 3 (✓).
  - T is present but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 and marked as -).
  - H and S are absent.

So, combining all the information:

1. The secret word has A in position 2 and L in position 3. So the word is _ A L _ _.

2. T is in the word, but not in position 4 (and not in position 2 or 3, since those are filled). Possible positions for T are 1, 4, or 5? But position 4 was tested and was wrong, so T cannot be in position 4. Therefore, T must be in position 1 or 5.

Also, note that positions:
- Position 1: unknown, but T might be here? Or another letter.
- Position 4: unknown, but T cannot be here because in ""halts"" T was in position 4 and marked as wrong position.
- Position 5: unknown, T might be here.

3. Absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S. And from previous, so total absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ A L _ _, with:
- Letters that must be present: T (somewhere, not in position 4).
- And possibly other letters we haven't eliminated.

Available letters: We have to use letters not eliminated. Eliminated letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.

So available letters: A is already placed, so for the other positions we need letters from: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. And T is one of the letters that must be included.

But T is in the word, and it must be in position 1 or 5.

Now, the word is _ A L _ _

Also, we haven't tested many letters, so we need to include T and one more letter (since two blanks: positions 1 and 5? Actually, position 4 is also blank? Wait, no: the word has positions 1, 4, and 5 to fill? Positions:
- Position 1: unknown
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 3: L (fixed)
- Position 4: unknown
- Position 5: unknown

But we have two constraints:
- T must be in the word and is not in position 4. So T must be in position 1 or 5.
- The secret word might have other letters from the available set.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits:
- Starts with: [letter] then A, then L, then [letter], then [letter]
- T must be in the word, so either position 1 or 5. And cannot be in position 4? Actually, position 4 cannot have T because it was marked wrong there. Similarly, positions 2 and 3 are A and L, so T must be in 1 or 5.

Additionally, position 4 must be filled with a letter that is not T and not any eliminated letter.

So possible structures:
- If T is in position 1: T A L _ _ 
- If T is in position 5: _ A L _ T

Now, we need to choose a word that satisfies one of these and uses available letters.

Let's list possible words.

First, if T is in position 1: T A L _ _

Possible letters for positions 4 and 5: from available: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we must form a valid English word.

Possible words: 
- ""TALKY"" -> T, A, L, K, Y -> positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:L, 4:K, 5:Y. But we have feedback that in guess 3 ""halts"", the T was marked as present but wrong position (position 4). However, in ""TALKY"", T is in position 1, which is fine. But we need to check if K and Y are available. They are not eliminated. Also, note that in ""halts"", the T was in position 4: if in the secret word T is in position 1, then when we guessed ""halts"" (which had T in position 4), the feedback would mark T as '-' because it is present but not in the correct position. That matches the feedback (T was marked as '-'). So possible.

But is ""TALKY"" a word? Yes, meaning talkative.

Other possibilities:
- ""TALKS"" -> T, A, L, K, S -> but S is eliminated (from guess 3: S(x)). So S cannot be used.
- ""TALLY"" -> T, A, L, L, Y -> duplicate L? And L is fixed in position 3. But here, we have L in position 3 and another L? The feedback hasn't indicated if L is duplicated. However, if the secret word has two L's, it would be fine. But ""TALLY"" has L in position 4? Position 4 is L, but in the secret word, position 3 is L. So if we have ""TALLY"", it would be T A L L Y -> positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y. Then in the secret word, if it has L at position 3 and another at position 4, then when we guessed ""halts"" (which had L at position 3, correct, and no L elsewhere?), but we had only one L in ""halts"". In ""halts"", we had L at position 3 (which was correct) and no other L. So if the secret word has two L's, we don't know.

But we don't have evidence against it. However, ""TALLY"" might not be the best because we are duplicating L when we haven't tested for duplicates.

Similarly, ""TALKY"" is acceptable.

But we also have the option with T in position 5: _ A L _ T

Then positions: 1: ?, 2:A, 3:L, 4:?, 5:T

Possible words:
- ""WALTZ"" -> W, A, L, T, Z? Wait, positions: 1:W, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:Z. But in this case, T is in position 4? Then in the feedback from guess 3 (""halts""), we had T in position 4 marked as wrong. But if the secret word has T in position 4, then when we guessed ""halts"" we should have gotten a ✓ for T in position 4? Because it would be the correct position. But the feedback was T(-), meaning wrong position. So if T were in position 4, it would have been marked ✓. Therefore, T cannot be in position 4.

In the structure _ A L _ T, if T is at position 5, then position 4 is not T. So for example, ""BALMY"" -> but position 5 is Y? Not T.

What are words ending with T? Like ""EXALT"" -> but E and X? E is eliminated.

""FINAL"" -> not ending with T, and N eliminated.

So for _ A L _ T:

Possible options:
- ""MALTY"" -> M, A, L, T, Y? But then positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:Y? But we cannot have T in position 4 because then in ""halts"" it should be ✓. Contradiction.

Therefore, T cannot be in position 4. And we already know it must be in 1 or 5. In the structure _ A L _ _, the position 4 cannot have T.

So the structure with T at position 5 is: _ A L _ T, where the blank at position 4 must be a letter that is not T.

Similarly, for position 1, it can be T or another letter. But T must be in the word, so if not at position 1, then at position 5.

Therefore, we have two cases:

Case 1: T at position 1: T A L _ _

Case 2: T at position 5: _ A L _ T

Now, let's list possible words for each case.

Case 1: T A L _ _

Fill positions 4 and 5 with available letters.

Possible words:
- ""TALKY"" (as above)
- ""TALKS"" -> but S eliminated
- ""TALLY"" -> T A L L Y -> positions 4:L? So we have L at position 3 and 4? That is possible. But we don't know if L is duplicated. Also, ""TALLY"" might be less common? But it is valid.
- ""TALAX"" ? Not a word.
- ""TALPA"" ? Not a word.
- ""TALMA"" ? Not common.
- ""TAMLY"" ? Not a word.

So ""TALKY"" and ""TALLY"" are possible.

Case 2: _ A L _ T

Position 1: a letter from available set, not T? Actually, position 1 could be T if we miss, but we are assuming case 2 has T at position 5, so position 1 should not be T, otherwise we would have two T's? No, T must be at position 1 or 5, so if at position 5, position 1 is not T.

So position 1: from available letters: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Position 4: similarly, available letters, but not T.

Possible words:
- ""BALKT"" ? Not a word.
- ""VALTZ"" ? Not a word.
- ""WALTZ"" -> W, A, L, T, Z -> but then T is in position 4? Positions: 1:W, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:Z → but we cannot have T at position 4 (as reasoned above) because it would contradict the feedback.
- ""MALT"" is 4 letters.
- ""MALTY"" -> M, A, L, T, Y → positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:Y → same issue: T at position 4.

But position 4 cannot be T! Otherwise, in ""halts"" it would have been marked as correct.

Therefore, we cannot have a word that has T at position 4. Hence, in case 2, we need a word ending with T and without T at position 4. So position 4 must be a non-T letter.

But is there any word like _ A L _ T? For example, ""EXALT"" has E (eliminated). ""FAL$T"" not a word. ""GALT"" not 5 letters.

Common words:
- ""HALFT"" ? Not a word.
- ""SALET"" -> S is eliminated and E eliminated.
- ""BALOT"" -> B, A, L, O, T → O is eliminated.

All appear to be invalid or using eliminated letters.

Therefore, case 2 might be extremely unlikely.

So case 1 is much more probable: T A L _ _

Now, position 4 and 5 must be filled with letters from available: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and not S, which is eliminated).

Possible words:
- ""TALKY"" → T, A, L, K, Y
- ""TALK"" is 4 letters.
- ""TALLY"" → T, A, L, L, Y
- ""TAMLY"" ? Not a word.
- ""TALPA"" ? Not common.
- ""TALAK"" ? Not common.

""TALKY"" and ""TALLY"" are the main candidates.

Moreover, we need to account for the feedback that T is present but not in position 4. In both words, T is in position 1, so that is fine. Position 4 would be K in ""TALKY"" or L in ""TALLY"".

Now, we need to choose between them. Alternatively, we can guess one of them to test.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we are on guess 4.

Another idea: we can guess a word that reuses some information but if possible, not fix T at position 1? But the structure requires T at 1 or 5.

Since case 2 seems hard, we'll go with case 1.

But is there a word with T at position 5? Let me try harder.

Possible words ending with T: ""EXALT"" → E eliminated.
""  A L   T"" → ""FALST"" ? Not a word.
""PALET"" → P, A, L, E, T → E eliminated, and if we ignore E, but E is not allowed.
""VALID"" → V, A, L, I, D → I and D eliminated? D and I from guess 2.

""VAULT"" → V, A, U, L, T → U eliminated.

It seems impossible to have a word with T at position 5 without using eliminated letters.

Therefore, the only possibility is T at position 1: T A L _ _

So the secret word is T A L _ _

Now, for positions 4 and 5, we consider the remaining letters.

We have two candidates: ""TALKY"" and ""TALLY"".

We can guess one of them.

To decide, note that in ""halts"", we used S, and it was absent. But in ""TALLY"", we have Y, which is not tested. Similarly, in ""TALKY"", we have K and Y, not tested.

Also, we haven't tested Y or K before.

Now, if we guess ""TALLY"", and if the secret word is ""TALKY"", we might get incorrect, but we can try.

Alternatively, we can think about the presence of duplicate letters: if we guess ""TALLY"" and the secret word has only one L, then position 4 (L) would be marked 'x'? But we have L at position 3 (correct) and position 4 L might be extra.

But based on feedback rules: if the secret word has only one L, then the L at position 3 is correct (✓), and the L at position 4 would be marked 'x' if there is no second L.

Similarly, if the secret word has two L's, then both L's would be accounted.

But we don't know.

However, guessing ""TALLY"" might not be as informative because we reuse L.

Therefore, perhaps ""TALKY"" is a better guess because it uses K and Y, new letters.

Moreover, ""TALKY"" is one of the possible words.

So let's choose ""TALKY"".

If we are wrong, we have tries left.

Thus, we guess ""TALKY"".

But note: is there another word? What about ""TALMI"" (like talmi gold)? But I is eliminated. So no.

So ""TALKY"" is a valid choice.

We guess ""TALKY"". 

And hope that positions 4 and 5 are K and Y.After analyzing the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A is in the word but not in position 3, and C, R, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""audio"")**: A is not in position 1, and U, D, I, O are absent.
- **Guess 3 (""halts"")**: A is correct in position 2, L is correct in position 3, T is present but not in position 4, and H, S are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed positions**: 
   - Position 2 is A (✓ from ""halts"").
   - Position 3 is L (✓ from ""halts"").
   - The word pattern is: `_ A L _ _`.
   
2. **Present letters**: 
   - A (fixed at position 2).
   - L (fixed at position 3).
   - T is confirmed present but cannot be in position 4 (since it was misplaced in ""halts""). Thus, T must be in position 1 or 5.

3. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S (10 letters eliminated).

4. **Remaining available letters**: Focus on untested common letters from B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus T.

5. **Strategy for Guess 4**:
   - Fill positions 1, 4, and 5 with available letters.
   - T must appear (in position 1 or 5).
   - Test new high-frequency consonants/vowels (e.g., K, Y) to identify the missing letters.
   - The word **""TALKY""** fits the pattern:
     - Position 1: T (tests if T belongs here).
     - Position 4: K (new letter).
     - Position 5: Y (new letter).
   - It uses distinct, untested letters and adheres to the feedback constraints.

So we cannot use E.\n- We must avoid E, so let\'s avoid vowels that we know are not in (E is out, but we don\'t know about I, O, U).\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word with \'A\' in the second position.\n\nLet me list some words without C, R, N, E and with \'A\':\n\n- ""SALAD"" -> but has two A\'s and two D\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but the secret word might have duplicates. However, to maximize information, we might prefer distinct letters.\n\nBut note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us if there are multiple same letters. So it\'s okay to use duplicates, but it might be less informative.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s try a word with distinct letters and \'A\' in a different position.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t used: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, B, etc.\n\nTry to form a word with \'A\' and four new letters.\n\nPossibilities:\n- \'A\' in first position: ""AUDIO"" -> uses A, U, D, I, O. All new letters. But note: we don\'t know if U, D, I, O are in the word. This would test four new vowels and one consonant? Actually, it\'s a good word for testing vowels and D.\n\nBut let\'s check: ""AUDIO"" has A in first position. We know A is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s in first. If we put it in first and it\'s not, we get a \'-\' for A. If it is, we get a check.\n\nAlternatively, we can put \'A\' in a position that we think is more likely? But we have no information about the position of A.\n\nAnother idea: since we know A is in the word and not in position 3, we can try to put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 to test.\n\nBut note: we have 5 positions and we know it\'s not in 3. So we can try position 2.\n\nLet me think of words with A in position 2: e.g., ""PASTA"" -> but has S, T, and two A\'s. Also, we avoid E? P, A, S, T, A. But we don\'t know if P, S, T are in the word. However, we are avoiding C, R, N, E.\n\nBut ""PASTA"" has duplicate A. Let\'s try without duplicates: ""HABIT"" -> H, A, B, I, T. A in position 2.\n\nOr ""DAISY"" -> but D, A, I, S, Y. However, we don\'t know about D, I, S, Y.\n\nBut note: we must avoid E, and also we know that the secret word has an A. So any word without C, R, N, E is acceptable.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T. A in position 3? But wait, we know A is not in position 3? Actually, in the feedback for ""crane"", A was in position 3 and marked as present but wrong position. That means the secret word has an A, but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong position again? But we don\'t know if the word has more than one A? However, we don\'t have evidence of multiple A\'s.\n\nTo avoid wasting a position, we should try A in a different position.\n\nSo let\'s avoid position 3 for A.\n\nTherefore, for the next guess, we should put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nI think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because:\n- It has A in position 1 (so we test if A is in position 1).\n- It uses four new letters: U, D, I, O.\n\nBut note: if the secret word has A in position 1, then we get a check. If not, we get a \'-\' and we know A is in the word but not in position 1.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word with A in position 4 or 5? That might be less common.\n\nAnother common word: ""SALET"" (a type of helmet) but it has E? We cannot use E. So avoid.\n\n""TALON"" -> has N? We know N is not in the word. So avoid.\n\n""MANOR"" -> has M, A, N, O, R -> but N and R are not in the word. So we cannot use N and R.\n\nWe must avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nSo let\'s look for words without these letters and with A.\n\nI think ""AUDIO"" is acceptable because:\n- A: we know is in the word.\n- U, D, I, O: we don\'t know, so we test them.\n\nBut note: the word ""AUDIO"" is a valid English word.\n\nAnother option: ""ADIEU"" -> but has E, which is not allowed because E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.\n\nSo ""AUDIO"" is better.\n\nBut what about ""AISLE""? -> has E and S, L, E? But E is not allowed.\n\nWe must avoid E.\n\nSo let\'s try to find words without E, C, R, N.\n\nAnother word: ""PLAID"" -> P, L, A, I, D. A is in position 3? But we want to avoid position 3 for A? Actually, we can try position 3 again? But we know that in the secret word, position 3 is not A. So if we put A in position 3, we will get a \'-\' again, which doesn\'t give us new information about the position of A. So it\'s better to try a different position.\n\nTherefore, let\'s avoid position 3.\n\nIn ""PLAID"", A is in position 3, so we skip.\n\nHow about ""ALOUD"": A, L, O, U, D. A in position 1. This is similar to ""AUDIO"" but without the I and with L and O.\n\nBut ""ALOUD"" uses A, L, O, U, D.\n\nAlternatively, ""AUDIO"" uses A, U, D, I, O.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nI think ""AUDIO"" is a common second guess.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the secret word has an A and we are testing four new letters.\n\nWe can also consider words that have A in the second position, such as ""PAINT"" -> but has N? N is not allowed.\n\n""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S. A in position 2. And no forbidden letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""HASTY"" -> H, A, S, T, Y. A in position 2.\n\nBut let\'s compare:\n\n- ""AUDIO"": tests A in position 1 and U, D, I, O.\n- ""MAILS"": tests A in position 2 and M, I, L, S.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests more vowels and the consonant D.\n\nBut note: the secret word is a 5-letter word without C, R, N, E, and with A. So it might have more consonants? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has more common consonants.\n\nAnother idea: since we know A is in the word, we can try to use a word that has A and also common consonants like T, S, L, etc.\n\nFor example: ""SLATE"" -> but has E? Not allowed.\n\n""TASTY"" -> T, A, S, T, Y -> duplicate T? And we don\'t know about T, S, Y.\n\nBut duplicate T might not be ideal.\n\n""PASTA"" -> P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A? And we don\'t know about P, S, T.\n\nBut we are avoiding C, R, N, E.\n\nI think ""MAILS"" is a good candidate: M, A, I, L, S. All distinct letters, A in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""HABIT"": H, A, B, I, T.\n\nBut let\'s choose one.\n\nI\'ll go with ""AUDIO"" because it is a word that uses common letters and we can get a lot of information.\n\nSo next guess: ""AUDIO""\n\nBut note: if the secret word has A in position 1, then we get a check for A. If not, we get a \'-\' and we know A is in the word but not in position 1.\n\nAlso, we test U, D, I, O.\n\nSo let\'s do that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with x).\n- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked with -).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include the letter \'A\' (since it\'s in the secret word), but avoid placing it in the third position again to gain new positional information.\n- Avoid using the letters C, R, N, E, as they are confirmed absent.\n- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P) to maximize information.\n- Prefer a word with distinct letters to cover more possibilities.\n\nA strong candidate is **""AUDIO""**:\n- Places \'A\' in position 1 (testing if \'A\' is the first letter; if not, the feedback will confirm it\'s elsewhere).\n- Introduces four new common letters: U, D, I, O.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and uses all distinct letters.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of \'A\' and reveal which of the new letters are present.\n\n<guess>audio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)\nMeaning:\n- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.\n- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.\n\nGuess 2: ""audio"" -> Feedback: A(-), U(x), D(x), I(x), O(x)\nMeaning:\n- A is still not in the 1st position (since we placed it in the 1st and got \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not here).\n- U, D, I, O are not in the word at all.\n\nSo, combining the information:\n- The secret word contains the letter A, but not in position 1 or 3.\n- The following letters are absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.\n\nWe have used 10 letters that are not in the word: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.\n\nThe word must contain A, and we know it\'s not in position 1 or 3. So possible positions for A: 2, 4, or 5.\n\nNow, we need to choose a new guess that:\n- Includes A in one of the positions 2, 4, or 5 (to test a new position and confirm A\'s location).\n- Uses only letters that we haven\'t eliminated. The eliminated letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.\n- We should use common letters that we haven\'t tried yet, such as: S, T, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe also want to maximize information by covering new letters and positions.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have A in position 2, 4, or 5.\n\nFirst, position 2: \n- Example: _ A _ _ _\n\nWe need to fill the blanks with letters from the remaining set (avoiding C,R,N,E,U,D,I,O).\n\nAvailable letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we\'ll focus on common ones).\n\nPossible words: \n- ""BASTE"" -> but E is eliminated, so no.\n- ""HASTY"" -> H, A, S, T, Y -> all allowed? H, S, T, Y are not eliminated. And A in position 2.\n\nBut we don\'t know if H, S, T, Y are in the word. This could be a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""PASTA"" -> but P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A? And we don\'t know about P, S, T. But note: we have two A\'s? The feedback so far doesn\'t indicate multiple A\'s, but it\'s possible. However, to maximize information, we might prefer distinct letters.\n\nBut ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5. We know A is in the word, so if we put A in two positions, we might get more information about how many A\'s there are? But it might be less efficient.\n\nAlternatively, ""TALON"" -> but N and O are eliminated.\n\n""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y -> all allowed. A in position 2.\n\nNow, position 4: \n- Example: _ _ _ A _\n\nWords: \n- ""PLAZA"" -> but Z is less common, and two A\'s? Also, P, L, A, Z, A -> but Z is not common and we have two A\'s.\n- ""FOCAL"" -> but F, O, C, A, L -> O and C are eliminated.\n\nWe need to avoid eliminated letters.\n\n""VISTA"" -> V, I, S, T, A -> but I is eliminated (from guess 2: I(x)).\n\n""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> N is eliminated.\n\nSo position 4 is harder.\n\nPosition 5:\n- Example: _ _ _ _ A\n\nWords:\n- ""PIZZA"" -> has Z and I (eliminated) and duplicate Z.\n- ""PAPA"" -> too short? Not 5 letters.\n- ""TIBIA"" -> T, I, B, I, A -> I is eliminated.\n\n""ALGAE"" -> E is eliminated.\n\n""MANIA"" -> M, A, N, I, A -> N and I eliminated.\n\nSo position 5 also seems difficult with the eliminated letters.\n\nTherefore, position 2 might be the easiest to try.\n\nLet\'s list possible words with A in position 2 and using only the available letters.\n\nAvailable letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we\'ll stick to common ones).\n\nCommon words:\n- ""HASPS"" -> H, A, S, P, S -> duplicate S? And not a common word.\n- ""BALMS"" -> B, A, L, M, S -> all distinct and common letters.\n- ""HALTS"" -> H, A, L, T, S -> distinct.\n- ""PALSY"" -> P, A, L, S, Y -> distinct.\n- ""TALKS"" -> T, A, L, K, S -> distinct.\n\nWe can choose one of these.\n\nBut note: we also want to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nWe have not tried: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe should prioritize the most common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, M, P, H, etc.\n\nSo a word that includes several of these: e.g., ""BALMS"" has B, A, L, M, S -> letters B, L, M, S.\n\nAlternatively, ""HALTS"" has H, A, L, T, S -> H, L, T, S.\n\nOr ""TALKS"" has T, A, L, K, S -> T, L, K, S.\n\nI think ""HALTS"" is a good choice because it includes H, L, T, S which are very common.\n\nBut note: we are placing A in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, we get a check. If not, we get a \'-\' and we know A must be in position 4 or 5.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""HALTS"".\n\nBut wait, we have to consider that the word might have A in position 4 or 5. If we put A in position 2 and it\'s not there, we still don\'t know about position 4 or 5. But we will have to test that later.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that has A in position 4 or 5 to test one of those. But as we saw, it\'s harder to find words without the eliminated letters.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven\'t tested (like 4 or 5) and also includes other common letters.\n\nFor example, position 4: \n- ""WASPY"" -> W, A, S, P, Y -> A in position 3? No, in ""WASPY"": W(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5) -> so A is in position 2? Not position 4.\n\nTo have A in position 4: \n- ""BESET"" -> E is eliminated.\n- ""FUSED"" -> U and E eliminated.\n- ""MOSSY"" -> no A.\n- ""PUSHY"" -> U eliminated.\n\nHow about ""LYMPH"" -> no A.\n\n""SYLPH"" -> no A.\n\n""NYMPH"" -> N eliminated.\n\nIt\'s challenging. Let\'s try position 5:\n\n- ""LLAMA"" -> L, L, A, M, A -> duplicate L and A? And we don\'t know about L and M. But L is available. ""LLAMA"" is a word? Yes, but it has two L\'s and two A\'s.\n\nBut we can try: ""LLAMA"" has A in position 4 and 5? Actually: positions: 1:L, 2:L, 3:A, 4:M, 5:A -> so A in 3 and 5? But we know A is not in position 3 (from first guess). So if we put A in position 3, we know it will be wrong. But we are trying to avoid position 3.\n\nIn ""LLAMA"", if we put it, the A in position 3 would be wrong (since we know A is not in position 3) and the A in position 5 might be correct or not.\n\nBut it\'s messy.\n\nAlternatively, ""PAPAL"" -> P, A, P, A, L -> A in position 2 and 4? But we don\'t know about P and L.\n\nBut again, duplicate letters.\n\nTo keep it simple, I think it\'s better to test A in position 2 with a word like ""HALTS"".\n\nWe can also consider ""PASTA"", but it has two A\'s? ""PASTA"": P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5). So A in position 2 and 5. We know A is in the word, so if we put two A\'s, we might get:\n- If the word has only one A, then one of the A\'s might be marked as \'-\' and the other as \'x\'? But the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word, it will be marked as \'-\' for wrong position or \'✓\' for correct. If there are two A\'s in the guess and the word has one A, then one A might be \'-\' (if in a position that is not the correct one) and the other might be \'x\' if that position is not the A and there\'s no extra A. But it\'s complicated.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I\'ll go with a word that has only one A and in position 2.\n\nSo ""HALTS"" is a good candidate: H, A, L, T, S.\n\nWe test A in position 2, and also test H, L, T, S.\n\nIf we get a \'-\' for A, then we know A is not in position 2 and must be in 4 or 5.\n\nIf we get a \'✓\' for A, then we know it\'s in position 2.\n\nAlso, we get feedback on H, L, T, S.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""HALTS"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure it\'s a valid word. Yes, ""halts"" is a valid English word.\n\nAnother option: ""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y. Also good.\n\nI think both are fine. I\'ll go with ""HALTS"" because it uses very common letters.\n\nSo next guess: ""HALTS""\n\nBut let\'s confirm the available letters: we have eliminated C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O. So H, A, L, T, S are all allowed.\n\nYes.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (""audio"")**: A is not in position 1. U, D, I, O are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **A must be in the word** but cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from feedback). Possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.\n- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O (10 letters total).\n- **Available letters**: Focus on common unused consonants (e.g., S, T, L, M, P, H, B, G, K, Y) and vowels (only A is confirmed; Y may act as a vowel).\n- **Strategy for next guess**:\n  - Test A in a new position (position 2, 4, or 5) to narrow its location.\n  - Use distinct, high-frequency letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, L, H).\n  - Avoid eliminated letters entirely.\n\nThe word **""HALTS""** is chosen because:\n- It places A in position 2 (testing if A is in position 2).\n- It uses new common letters (H, L, T, S) that haven\'t been tested.\n- All letters are distinct and from the available set.\n- It is a valid English word.\n\n<guess>halts</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)\nGuess 3: halts -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) L(✓) T(-) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)\n  - A is present but not in position 3.\n  - C, R, N, E are absent.\n\nGuess 2: ""audio"" -> A(-), U(x), D(x), I(x), O(x)\n  - A is present but not in position 1.\n  - U, D, I, O are absent.\n\nGuess 3: ""halts"" -> H(x), A(✓), L(✓), T(-), S(x)\n  - A is correct in position 2 (✓).\n  - L is correct in position 3 (✓).\n  - T is present but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 and marked as -).\n  - H and S are absent.\n\nSo, combining all the information:\n\n1. The secret word has A in position 2 and L in position 3. So the word is _ A L _ _.\n\n2. T is in the word, but not in position 4 (and not in position 2 or 3, since those are filled). Possible positions for T are 1, 4, or 5? But position 4 was tested and was wrong, so T cannot be in position 4. Therefore, T must be in position 1 or 5.\n\nAlso, note that positions:\n- Position 1: unknown, but T might be here? Or another letter.\n- Position 4: unknown, but T cannot be here because in ""halts"" T was in position 4 and marked as wrong position.\n- Position 5: unknown, T might be here.\n\n3. Absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S. And from previous, so total absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has the form: _ A L _ _, with:\n- Letters that must be present: T (somewhere, not in position 4).\n- And possibly other letters we haven\'t eliminated.\n\nAvailable letters: We have to use letters not eliminated. Eliminated letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.\n\nSo available letters: A is already placed, so for the other positions we need letters from: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. And T is one of the letters that must be included.\n\nBut T is in the word, and it must be in position 1 or 5.\n\nNow, the word is _ A L _ _\n\nAlso, we haven\'t tested many letters, so we need to include T and one more letter (since two blanks: positions 1 and 5? Actually, position 4 is also blank? Wait, no: the word has positions 1, 4, and 5 to fill? Positions:\n- Position 1: unknown\n- Position 2: A (fixed)\n- Position 3: L (fixed)\n- Position 4: unknown\n- Position 5: unknown\n\nBut we have two constraints:\n- T must be in the word and is not in position 4. So T must be in position 1 or 5.\n- The secret word might have other letters from the available set.\n\nNow, we need to guess a word that fits:\n- Starts with: [letter] then A, then L, then [letter], then [letter]\n- T must be in the word, so either position 1 or 5. And cannot be in position 4? Actually, position 4 cannot have T because it was marked wrong there. Similarly, positions 2 and 3 are A and L, so T must be in 1 or 5.\n\nAdditionally, position 4 must be filled with a letter that is not T and not any eliminated letter.\n\nSo possible structures:\n- If T is in position 1: T A L _ _ \n- If T is in position 5: _ A L _ T\n\nNow, we need to choose a word that satisfies one of these and uses available letters.\n\nLet\'s list possible words.\n\nFirst, if T is in position 1: T A L _ _\n\nPossible letters for positions 4 and 5: from available: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we must form a valid English word.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""TALKY"" -> T, A, L, K, Y -> positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:L, 4:K, 5:Y. But we have feedback that in guess 3 ""halts"", the T was marked as present but wrong position (position 4). However, in ""TALKY"", T is in position 1, which is fine. But we need to check if K and Y are available. They are not eliminated. Also, note that in ""halts"", the T was in position 4: if in the secret word T is in position 1, then when we guessed ""halts"" (which had T in position 4), the feedback would mark T as \'-\' because it is present but not in the correct position. That matches the feedback (T was marked as \'-\'). So possible.\n\nBut is ""TALKY"" a word? Yes, meaning talkative.\n\nOther possibilities:\n- ""TALKS"" -> T, A, L, K, S -> but S is eliminated (from guess 3: S(x)). So S cannot be used.\n- ""TALLY"" -> T, A, L, L, Y -> duplicate L? And L is fixed in position 3. But here, we have L in position 3 and another L? The feedback hasn\'t indicated if L is duplicated. However, if the secret word has two L\'s, it would be fine. But ""TALLY"" has L in position 4? Position 4 is L, but in the secret word, position 3 is L. So if we have ""TALLY"", it would be T A L L Y -> positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y. Then in the secret word, if it has L at position 3 and another at position 4, then when we guessed ""halts"" (which had L at position 3, correct, and no L elsewhere?), but we had only one L in ""halts"". In ""halts"", we had L at position 3 (which was correct) and no other L. So if the secret word has two L\'s, we don\'t know.\n\nBut we don\'t have evidence against it. However, ""TALLY"" might not be the best because we are duplicating L when we haven\'t tested for duplicates.\n\nSimilarly, ""TALKY"" is acceptable.\n\nBut we also have the option with T in position 5: _ A L _ T\n\nThen positions: 1: ?, 2:A, 3:L, 4:?, 5:T\n\nPossible words:\n- ""WALTZ"" -> W, A, L, T, Z? Wait, positions: 1:W, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:Z. But in this case, T is in position 4? Then in the feedback from guess 3 (""halts""), we had T in position 4 marked as wrong. But if the secret word has T in position 4, then when we guessed ""halts"" we should have gotten a ✓ for T in position 4? Because it would be the correct position. But the feedback was T(-), meaning wrong position. So if T were in position 4, it would have been marked ✓. Therefore, T cannot be in position 4.\n\nIn the structure _ A L _ T, if T is at position 5, then position 4 is not T. So for example, ""BALMY"" -> but position 5 is Y? Not T.\n\nWhat are words ending with T? Like ""EXALT"" -> but E and X? E is eliminated.\n\n""FINAL"" -> not ending with T, and N eliminated.\n\nSo for _ A L _ T:\n\nPossible options:\n- ""MALTY"" -> M, A, L, T, Y? But then positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:Y? But we cannot have T in position 4 because then in ""halts"" it should be ✓. Contradiction.\n\nTherefore, T cannot be in position 4. And we already know it must be in 1 or 5. In the structure _ A L _ _, the position 4 cannot have T.\n\nSo the structure with T at position 5 is: _ A L _ T, where the blank at position 4 must be a letter that is not T.\n\nSimilarly, for position 1, it can be T or another letter. But T must be in the word, so if not at position 1, then at position 5.\n\nTherefore, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: T at position 1: T A L _ _\n\nCase 2: T at position 5: _ A L _ T\n\nNow, let\'s list possible words for each case.\n\nCase 1: T A L _ _\n\nFill positions 4 and 5 with available letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""TALKY"" (as above)\n- ""TALKS"" -> but S eliminated\n- ""TALLY"" -> T A L L Y -> positions 4:L? So we have L at position 3 and 4? That is possible. But we don\'t know if L is duplicated. Also, ""TALLY"" might be less common? But it is valid.\n- ""TALAX"" ? Not a word.\n- ""TALPA"" ? Not a word.\n- ""TALMA"" ? Not common.\n- ""TAMLY"" ? Not a word.\n\nSo ""TALKY"" and ""TALLY"" are possible.\n\nCase 2: _ A L _ T\n\nPosition 1: a letter from available set, not T? Actually, position 1 could be T if we miss, but we are assuming case 2 has T at position 5, so position 1 should not be T, otherwise we would have two T\'s? No, T must be at position 1 or 5, so if at position 5, position 1 is not T.\n\nSo position 1: from available letters: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nPosition 4: similarly, available letters, but not T.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BALKT"" ? Not a word.\n- ""VALTZ"" ? Not a word.\n- ""WALTZ"" -> W, A, L, T, Z -> but then T is in position 4? Positions: 1:W, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:Z → but we cannot have T at position 4 (as reasoned above) because it would contradict the feedback.\n- ""MALT"" is 4 letters.\n- ""MALTY"" -> M, A, L, T, Y → positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:Y → same issue: T at position 4.\n\nBut position 4 cannot be T! Otherwise, in ""halts"" it would have been marked as correct.\n\nTherefore, we cannot have a word that has T at position 4. Hence, in case 2, we need a word ending with T and without T at position 4. So position 4 must be a non-T letter.\n\nBut is there any word like _ A L _ T? For example, ""EXALT"" has E (eliminated). ""FAL$T"" not a word. ""GALT"" not 5 letters.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""HALFT"" ? Not a word.\n- ""SALET"" -> S is eliminated and E eliminated.\n- ""BALOT"" -> B, A, L, O, T → O is eliminated.\n\nAll appear to be invalid or using eliminated letters.\n\nTherefore, case 2 might be extremely unlikely.\n\nSo case 1 is much more probable: T A L _ _\n\nNow, position 4 and 5 must be filled with letters from available: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and not S, which is eliminated).\n\nPossible words:\n- ""TALKY"" → T, A, L, K, Y\n- ""TALK"" is 4 letters.\n- ""TALLY"" → T, A, L, L, Y\n- ""TAMLY"" ? Not a word.\n- ""TALPA"" ? Not common.\n- ""TALAK"" ? Not common.\n\n""TALKY"" and ""TALLY"" are the main candidates.\n\nMoreover, we need to account for the feedback that T is present but not in position 4. In both words, T is in position 1, so that is fine. Position 4 would be K in ""TALKY"" or L in ""TALLY"".\n\nNow, we need to choose between them. Alternatively, we can guess one of them to test.\n\nBut note: we have 6 tries, so we are on guess 4.\n\nAnother idea: we can guess a word that reuses some information but if possible, not fix T at position 1? But the structure requires T at 1 or 5.\n\nSince case 2 seems hard, we\'ll go with case 1.\n\nBut is there a word with T at position 5? Let me try harder.\n\nPossible words ending with T: ""EXALT"" → E eliminated.\n""  A L   T"" → ""FALST"" ? Not a word.\n""PALET"" → P, A, L, E, T → E eliminated, and if we ignore E, but E is not allowed.\n""VALID"" → V, A, L, I, D → I and D eliminated? D and I from guess 2.\n\n""VAULT"" → V, A, U, L, T → U eliminated.\n\nIt seems impossible to have a word with T at position 5 without using eliminated letters.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is T at position 1: T A L _ _\n\nSo the secret word is T A L _ _\n\nNow, for positions 4 and 5, we consider the remaining letters.\n\nWe have two candidates: ""TALKY"" and ""TALLY"".\n\nWe can guess one of them.\n\nTo decide, note that in ""halts"", we used S, and it was absent. But in ""TALLY"", we have Y, which is not tested. Similarly, in ""TALKY"", we have K and Y, not tested.\n\nAlso, we haven\'t tested Y or K before.\n\nNow, if we guess ""TALLY"", and if the secret word is ""TALKY"", we might get incorrect, but we can try.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about the presence of duplicate letters: if we guess ""TALLY"" and the secret word has only one L, then position 4 (L) would be marked \'x\'? But we have L at position 3 (correct) and position 4 L might be extra.\n\nBut based on feedback rules: if the secret word has only one L, then the L at position 3 is correct (✓), and the L at position 4 would be marked \'x\' if there is no second L.\n\nSimilarly, if the secret word has two L\'s, then both L\'s would be accounted.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nHowever, guessing ""TALLY"" might not be as informative because we reuse L.\n\nTherefore, perhaps ""TALKY"" is a better guess because it uses K and Y, new letters.\n\nMoreover, ""TALKY"" is one of the possible words.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""TALKY"".\n\nIf we are wrong, we have tries left.\n\nThus, we guess ""TALKY"".\n\nBut note: is there another word? What about ""TALMI"" (like talmi gold)? But I is eliminated. So no.\n\nSo ""TALKY"" is a valid choice.\n\nWe guess ""TALKY"". \n\nAnd hope that positions 4 and 5 are K and Y.After analyzing the feedback from all previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A is in the word but not in position 3, and C, R, N, E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (""audio"")**: A is not in position 1, and U, D, I, O are absent.\n- **Guess 3 (""halts"")**: A is correct in position 2, L is correct in position 3, T is present but not in position 4, and H, S are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Confirmed positions**: \n   - Position 2 is A (✓ from ""halts"").\n   - Position 3 is L (✓ from ""halts"").\n   - The word pattern is: `_ A L _ _`.\n   \n2. **Present letters**: \n   - A (fixed at position 2).\n   - L (fixed at position 3).\n   - T is confirmed present but cannot be in position 4 (since it was misplaced in ""halts"").

We have feedback from the fourth guess ""talky"":
- T(✓) A(✓) L(✓) K(x) Y(✓)

This means:
- T is correct in position 1.
- A is correct in position 2.
- L is correct in position 3.
- K is not in the word (x).
- Y is correct in position 5.

So the secret word is: T A L _ Y

We know the first three letters and the last letter: T, A, L, ?, Y

Position 4 is missing, and we know K is not in the word (so the missing letter is not K).

Also, from previous feedback, we have eliminated: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S, and now K.

So the available letters for position 4 are: B, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. (We must avoid the eliminated letters and note that T, A, L, Y are already placed.)

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form ""TAL_Y"" (with the fourth letter being one of the available letters).

Possible words:
- ""TALLY"" -> but we have Y at position 5, and ""TALLY"" would be T,A,L,L,Y. But we have L at position 3, and if we put L at position 4, that would be a duplicate L. However, we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But in the feedback for ""halts"", we had only one L (at position 3, correct) and no indication of a second L. Also, in ""talky"", we had K and Y, but no L at position 4. So if the word were ""TALLY"", then in ""talky"" we would have T,A,L (correct), K (which is not in the word, so x), and Y (correct). But the fourth letter in ""talky"" is K, which is not in ""TALLY"", so that matches (K is absent). However, in ""TALLY"", the fourth letter is L, which we haven't tested in position 4? But we know from ""halts"" that T is not in position 4, but we don't have direct feedback on L in position 4.

But let's check: if the secret word is ""TALLY"", then in the third guess ""halts"" (which was H,A,L,T,S), we have:
- H: absent (x) -> correct because H is not in ""TALLY""
- A: position 2 correct (✓) -> correct
- L: position 3 correct (✓) -> correct
- T: present but not in position 4 (since in ""TALLY"", T is at position 1, so T is in the word but not at position 4) -> so (-) is correct
- S: absent (x) -> correct

And in the fourth guess ""talky"": T,A,L,K,Y
- T: position 1 correct (✓)
- A: position 2 correct (✓)
- L: position 3 correct (✓)
- K: absent (x) -> because ""TALLY"" has no K -> correct
- Y: position 5 correct (✓)

So ""TALLY"" is a possible word.

But is there another word? For example, ""TALCY""? But C is eliminated. ""TALFY""? Not a word. ""TALGY""? Not a word. ""TALJY""? Not a word. ""TALMY"" -> T,A,L,M,Y. Is ""TALMY"" a word? Not that I know. ""TALPY""? Not a word. ""TALQY""? No. ""TALVY""? Not common. ""TALWY""? No. ""TALXY""? No. ""TALZY""? No.

What about ""TALAY""? But that would have two A's? And A is at position 2, so position 4 A? But we don't know if A is duplicated. However, in the first guess ""crane"", we had A at position 3 and it was wrong position, but that doesn't rule out multiple A's. But in ""TALAY"", it would be T,A,L,A,Y. Then in the feedback for ""crane"": A was marked as present but wrong position (position 3). In ""TALAY"", A is at position 2 and 4. So position 3 is L, not A. So the A at position 3 in ""crane"" would be wrong, which is consistent. But in ""audio"", we had A at position 1, which is not in the word? But in ""TALAY"", position 1 is T, so A at position 1 in ""audio"" would be marked as absent? But in the feedback, it was marked as present but wrong position? No, in ""audio"" feedback: A was marked as (-), meaning present but wrong position. But if the secret word is ""TALAY"", then A is in the word, so if we put A at position 1 (as in ""audio""), it should be marked as present but wrong position, which matches. However, in ""audio"", we also had U, D, I, O which are absent, and they are not in ""TALAY"", so that matches. But in ""halts"": H absent, A correct, L correct, T present but wrong position (since in ""TALAY"", T is at position 1, so not at 4), S absent -> matches. In ""talky"": T correct, A correct, L correct, K absent (since no K), Y correct -> matches.

But is ""TALAY"" a word? I don't think it's a standard English word. Similarly, ""TALBY"", ""TALFY"", etc., are not words.

Another possibility: ""TALKY"" we guessed and got K absent, so it's not that.

What about ""TALMI""? But I is eliminated.

So the only common word that fits is ""TALLY"".

Therefore, the secret word must be ""TALLY"".

But in ""TALLY"", we have two L's. In our previous guesses, we only had one L (in ""halts"" at position 3, which was correct). In ""talky"", we had L at position 3 (correct) and no other L. So if the secret word has two L's, then in ""halts"" and ""talky"", we only tested one L, so we wouldn't know about the second L. But that's consistent.

Moreover, we have no feedback that contradicts ""TALLY"".

So we can guess ""TALLY"" as the next word.

But note: we are to make a new guess, and we have only one blank, so we can solve it.

Alternatively, we can consider if there are other words. For example, ""TALAR"" but R is eliminated. ""TALAS"" but S is eliminated. ""TALAK"" not a word. ""TALAQ"" not common. So I think ""TALLY"" is the only common word.

Therefore, we guess ""TALLY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, the secret word is now clear:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: Eliminated C, R, N, E; confirmed A is present but not in position 3.
- **Guess 2 (""audio"")**: Eliminated U, D, I, O; confirmed A is not in position 1.
- **Guess 3 (""halts"")**: Confirmed A in position 2 (✓), L in position 3 (✓), T present but not in position 4 (-), and eliminated H, S.
- **Guess 4 (""talky"")**: Confirmed T in position 1 (✓), A in position 2 (✓), L in position 3 (✓), Y in position 5 (✓), and eliminated K.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word pattern is **T A L _ Y** (positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 are confirmed).
- Position 4 must be filled with a letter that:
  - Is **not** eliminated (eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S, K).
  - Forms a valid English word with ""TAL_Y"".
- The only common English word fitting this pattern is **""TALLY""** (T-A-L-L-Y), where the fourth letter is L.

### Why ""TALLY""?
- It uses L in position 4, which is consistent with the feedback:
  - L is already confirmed in position 3, but duplicates are possible (no feedback rules out multiple L's).
  - All other letters (T, A, L, Y) are confirmed in their positions.
  - No eliminated letters are used.
- Other combinations (e.g., ""TALMY"", ""TALGY"") are not valid words.
