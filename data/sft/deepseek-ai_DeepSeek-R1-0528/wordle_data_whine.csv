We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.
 Also, including at least two vowels is good.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. 
 - C and R are common consonants.
 - A and E are common vowels.
 - N is also a common consonant.

 This word covers 5 distinct letters and is a valid English word.

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: ✓ (correct position, so N is the 4th letter in the secret word)
  E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the 5th letter in the secret word)

Therefore, we know:
  The secret word ends with ""NE"" (since N is the 4th letter and E is the 5th).
  The letters C, R, A are not in the word at all.

We have 6 tries and this is the second guess.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
  - Has 'N' in the 4th position and 'E' in the 5th position.
  - Does not contain C, R, or A.
  - We should try to include other common letters to get more information.

Since the first three letters are unknown, we can try a word that has the form: _ _ _ N E

We also know that the word does not contain C, R, A. So we avoid these.

Common consonants and vowels we can use: we have to choose the first three letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, R, A).

We might want to use a word that has common letters like S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Let's think of words ending with ""NE"" that are 5 letters and don't have C, R, A.

Some possibilities:
  - SHINE: S, H, I, N, E -> positions: S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5)
  - PHONE: P, H, O, N, E -> but we don't know if P, H, O are in the word.
  - THINE: T, H, I, N, E
  - STONE: S, T, O, N, E -> but O is a vowel that we haven't tested.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since we know two letters are fixed at the end, we can try to use a word that has common letters in the first three positions that we haven't tried.

We have not used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should avoid repeating the same letters to maximize information.

Let me list some words ending in ""NE"" without C, R, A:

  - SHINE
  - THINE
  - PHONE
  - STONE
  - SHONE
  - ALONE -> but has A (which is excluded) -> invalid
  - OZONE -> O, Z, O, N, E -> but Z is uncommon.

We can also consider:

  - MINCE -> but has C (excluded) -> invalid
  - DANCE -> has A -> invalid
  - LINED -> but doesn't end with NE? It ends with ED. We need NE at the end.

We must have the 4th as N and 5th as E.

Another one: ""SPINE"" -> S, P, I, N, E -> no C, R, A.

But note: we have already used the letter E and N, but we are allowed to reuse them? Actually, in the feedback, we know the positions of N and E are fixed. However, we don't know about the other positions. But we are sure that the word has exactly one E and one N? Not necessarily. The feedback only tells us about the positions we guessed. There could be more than one E or N? But in the feedback, we only see one E and one N. However, the feedback for the other positions (if there were duplicate letters) would have shown differently. But in our first guess, we had only one E and one N, and they were in the correct positions. So if the word had two N's, then the other N would have been indicated by a '-' if it was in the wrong position. But we didn't have any other N. Similarly for E. So we can assume that the word has at least one N and one E, and they are at the 4th and 5th positions. But it might have more? However, the feedback for the first three letters didn't show any N or E, so if there were another N or E in the first three, it would have been marked with '-' if present. But in our first guess, the first three letters (C, R, A) were all marked as absent (x). So the word does not have any other N or E? Actually, no: because the feedback for the first three letters only says that C, R, A are absent, but it doesn't say anything about N or E in the first three because we didn't guess them there. So we cannot rule out that the word has another N or E in the first three positions.

But note: the feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x -> not in word
  R: x -> not in word
  A: x -> not in word
  N: ✓ -> correct position (so there is an N at position 4)
  E: ✓ -> correct position (so there is an E at position 5)

If the word had an N in the first three positions, then when we guessed ""crane"", we would have seen a '-' for the N in position 4? No, because the N in position 4 is correct. But if there was an extra N in the word, and we didn't guess it in the first three, then we wouldn't know. Similarly for E.

So we cannot assume that there is only one N and one E. The word might have more.

But for our next guess, we are forced to put N at position 4 and E at position 5. So we are only guessing the first three letters.

We should choose a word that has three new letters (that we haven't tried) in the first three positions.

We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test as many common letters as possible.

Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U ... but we already know E and N are in the word (at least at the end). We also know A and R are out. So we avoid A and R.

So common letters left: T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U, etc.

We can try a word that has T, O, I, S, H, etc. in the first three.

Let me think of words that end with ""NE"" and have three new letters.

Some options:

  - STONE: S, T, O, N, E -> tests S, T, O (and we know N and E are fixed). But note: we are testing S at position 1, T at 2, O at 3.
  - SHINE: S, H, I, N, E -> tests S, H, I.
  - PHONE: P, H, O, N, E -> tests P, H, O.
  - THINE: T, H, I, N, E -> tests T, H, I.

Which one to choose? We want to cover more common letters.

The most common letters left are S, T, I, O, H.

We can try to cover three of these.

I think ""SHINE"" is a good candidate because it has S, H, I (all common) and we haven't tried them.

Alternatively, ""STONE"" has S, T, O (also common).

But note: we are not sure if the word has an O or not. Similarly for I.

Another candidate: ""SLINE"" - but is that a word? I don't think ""sline"" is a common word. We must use valid words.

We can also consider ""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> but we haven't tried O, P, I.

But let me check: we must avoid C, R, A. O, P, I are not in that list.

However, we are trying to maximize information. We might want to use a word that has letters that are more likely to be in the word.

But without any other information, we can choose one arbitrarily.

I think ""SHINE"" is a good choice because it uses three common letters: S, H, I.

So I'll go with ""SHINE"".

But note: we are not forced to use the same N and E? Actually, we are: because we know the 4th and 5th letters are N and E. So we must use a word that has N at position 4 and E at position 5.

Therefore, our next guess: SHINE.

We are hoping to get feedback on S, H, I.

If we get a ✓ for any of them, we know that letter is in the correct position. If we get a '-', then that letter is in the word but in a different position. If we get an 'x', then that letter is not in the word.

But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know.

So let's go with ""SHINE"".

<guess>shine</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are not in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- N is in the correct position (4th letter, marked ""✓"").
- E is in the correct position (5th letter, marked ""✓"").

This means:
- The secret word ends with ""NE"".
- The first three letters must exclude C, R, and A, and should focus on untested common letters (e.g., S, T, I, O, H, L, D) to maximize new information.

For the second guess, I chose **SHINE** because:
- It fits the pattern `_ _ _ N E`.
- It tests three new common letters (S, H, I) in the first three positions.
- It avoids previously excluded letters (C, R, A).
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help identify if S, H, or I are present and in the right positions, narrowing down possibilities for the next guess.

We also know that the word does not contain C, R, A. So we avoid these.

Common consonants and vowels we can use: we have to choose the first three letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, R, A).

We might want to use a word that has common letters like S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Let's think of words ending with ""NE"" that are 5 letters and don't have C, R, A.

Some possibilities:
  - SHINE: S, H, I, N, E -> positions: S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5)
  - PHONE: P, H, O, N, E -> but we don't know if P, H, O are in the word.
  - THINE: T, H, I, N, E
  - STONE: S, T, O, N, E -> but O is a vowel that we haven't tested.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since we know two letters are fixed at the end, we can try to use a word that has common letters in the first three positions that we haven't tried.

We have not used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should avoid repeating the same letters to maximize information.

Let me list some words ending in ""NE"" without C, R, A:

  - SHINE
  - THINE
  - PHONE
  - STONE
  - SHONE
  - ALONE -> but has A (which is excluded) -> invalid
  - OZONE -> O, Z, O, N, E -> but Z is uncommon.

We can also consider:

  - MINCE -> but has C (excluded) -> invalid
  - DANCE -> has A -> invalid
  - LINED -> but doesn't end with NE? It ends with ED. We need NE at the end.

We must have the 4th as N and 5th as E.

Another one: ""SPINE"" -> S, P, I, N, E -> no C, R, A.

But note: we have already used the letter E and N, but we are allowed to reuse them? Actually, in the feedback, we know the positions of N and E are fixed. However, we don't know about the other positions. But we are sure that the word has exactly one E and one N? Not necessarily. The feedback only tells us about the positions we guessed. There could be more than one E or N? But in the feedback, we only see one E and one N. However, the feedback for the other positions (if there were duplicate letters) would have shown differently. But in our first guess, we had only one E and one N, and they were in the correct positions. So if the word had two N's, then the other N would have been indicated by a '-' if it was in the wrong position. But we didn't have any other N. Similarly for E. So we can assume that the word has at least one N and one E, and they are at the 4th and 5th positions. But it might have more? However, the feedback for the first three letters didn't show any N or E, so if there were another N or E in the first three, it would have been marked with '-' if present. But in our first guess, the first three letters (C, R, A) were all marked as absent (x). So the word does not have any other N or E? Actually, no: because the feedback for the first three letters only says that C, R, A are absent, but it doesn't say anything about N or E in the first three because we didn't guess them there. So we cannot rule out that the word has another N or E in the first three positions.

But note: the feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x -> not in word
  R: x -> not in word
  A: x -> not in word
  N: ✓ -> correct position (so there is an N at position 4)
  E: ✓ -> correct position (so there is an E at position 5)

If the word had an N in the first three positions, then when we guessed ""crane"", we would have seen a '-' for the N in position 4? No, because the N in position 4 is correct. But if there was an extra N in the word, and we didn't guess it in the first three, then we wouldn't know. Similarly for E.

So we cannot assume that there is only one N and one E. The word might have more.

But for our next guess, we are forced to put N at position 4 and E at position 5. So we are only guessing the first three letters.

We should choose a word that has three new letters (that we haven't tried) in the first three positions.

We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test as many common letters as possible.

Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U ... but we already know E and N are in the word (at least at the end). We also know A and R are out. So we avoid A and R.

So common letters left: T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U, etc.

We can try a word that has T, O, I, S, H, etc. in the first three.

Let me think of words that end with ""NE"" and have three new letters.

Some options:

  - STONE: S, T, O, N, E -> tests S, T, O (and we know N and E are fixed). But note: we are testing S at position 1, T at 2, O at 3.
  - SHINE: S, H, I, N, E -> tests S, H, I.
  - PHONE: P, H, O, N, E -> tests P, H, O.
  - THINE: T, H, I, N, E -> tests T, H, I.

Which one to choose? We want to cover more common letters.

The most common letters left are S, T, I, O, H.

We can try to cover three of these.

I think ""SHINE"" is a good candidate because it has S, H, I (all common) and we haven't tried them.

Alternatively, ""STONE"" has S, T, O (also common).

But note: we are not sure if the word has an O or not. Similarly for I.

Another candidate: ""SLINE"" - but is that a word? I don't think ""sline"" is a common word. We must use valid words.

We can also consider ""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> but we haven't tried O, P, I.

But let me check: we must avoid C, R, A. O, P, I are not in that list.

However, we are trying to maximize information. We might want to use a word that has letters that are more likely to be in the word.

But without any other information, we can choose one arbitrarily.

I think ""SHINE"" is a good choice because it uses three common letters: S, H, I.

So I'll go with ""SHINE"".

But note: we are not forced to use the same N and E? Actually, we are: because we know the 4th and 5th letters are N and E. So we must use a word that has N at position 4 and E at position 5.

Therefore, our next guess: SHINE.

We are hoping to get feedback on S, H, I.

If we get a ✓ for any of them, we know that letter is in the correct position. If we get a '-', then that letter is in the word but in a different position. If we get an 'x', then that letter is not in the word.

But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know.

So let's go with ""SHINE"".

<guess>shine</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are not in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- N is in the correct position (4th letter, marked ""✓"").
- E is in the correct position (5th letter, marked ""✓"").

This means:
- The secret word ends with ""NE"".
- The first three letters must exclude C, R, and A, and should focus on untested common letters (e.g., S, T, I, O, H, L, D) to maximize new information.

For the second guess, I chose **SHINE** because:
- It fits the pattern `_ _ _ N E`.
- It tests three new common letters (S, H, I) in the first three positions.
- It avoids previously excluded letters (C, R, A).
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help identify if S, H, or I are present and in the right positions, narrowing down possibilities for the next guess.

We are given feedback from the second guess ""shine"":
  S: x (not in the word)
  H: ✓ (correct position, so H is the 2nd letter in the secret word)
  I: ✓ (correct position, so I is the 3rd letter)
  N: ✓ (correct position, so N is the 4th letter)
  E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the 5th letter)

Therefore, we know three more things:
  The secret word has the form: _ H I N E (since positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 are fixed as H, I, N, E).
  The first letter is unknown and must be a letter that we haven't eliminated.
  Additionally, S is not in the word.

From the first guess, we also know that C, R, A are not in the word (they were marked 'x').

So, the secret word is of the form: ? H I N E

The first letter (position 1) must be one of the letters we haven't tried and not excluded.

Excluded letters so far: C, R, A, S.

We have tried: C, R, A, N, E (from guess 1) and S, H, I (from guess 2). But note that H and I are in the word and in correct positions, and N and E are also confirmed.

The first letter must be a letter that:
  - Is not in the excluded list: so not C, R, A, S.
  - And it must form a valid English word when placed before ""HINE"".

We must consider only the letters that are left.

Possible letters for the first position: 
  All letters except the ones we know are absent: C, R, A, S, and also note that letters already placed (H, I, N, E) might be duplicated? But let's see.

We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, since the first position is the only unknown, and we have no indication that there are duplicates, we should consider words that start with a letter not excluding.

List possible candidates: words that end with HINE? Actually, the word is ""?HINE"".

We need a 5-letter word that ends with ""HINE"" (positions 2-5: H, I, N, E). So the only missing letter is the first character.

What words are there that match this pattern?

  - THINE: an old word meaning ""yours"" (possessive form). T is not excluded? T hasn't been tried.

  - Other possibilities: 
      WHINE: meaning to complain. W is not excluded.
      SHINE: we tried and it was wrong because the first letter S was absent. So we cannot use SHINE again.

But we also have:
  - CHINE: but C is excluded (from first guess) -> invalid.
  - RHINE: but R is excluded -> invalid.

So possible words: 
  - THINE
  - WHINE
  - PHINE? Not a common word.
  - AHINE? A is excluded.

Are there others? 
  - OHINE? Not a word.
  - DHINE? Not a word.
  - BHINE? Not a word.

So common words: THINE and WHINE.

But we need to verify: 
  THINE: T H I N E -> valid, meaning ""yours"" (old English).
  WHINE: W H I N E -> valid, meaning a long high-pitched cry or complaint.

Also, note that the first guess said A is not in the word, so no word with A.

But our word must have the form: ? H I N E.

We have two strong candidates: THINE and WHINE.

However, we have only one position unknown, so we need to guess one of these.

But note: we have tried S? Yes, and it was absent. T and W haven't been tried.

We can choose either.

But we also need to consider that if we guess THINE or WHINE, we might solve it if it's correct, or we'll know.

But we have 4 tries left (this is the third guess). Let's try THINE? Or WHINE?

We have no information about T or W. So we can choose arbitrarily.

Since T is more common than W, perhaps THINE is more likely? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests other letters? But note: we only have to fill the first position. We cannot change the rest because they are confirmed correct.

For example, if we guess a word like ""WHINE"", it must be of the exact pattern: ? H I N E. So we cannot change the other letters.

Therefore, we must guess a word that has H, I, N, E in positions 2,3,4,5.

So the only freedom is the first letter.

Thus, we must choose between the possible words: THINE and WHINE.

There might be others? Let me think: 
  KHINE? Not English.
  XHINE? Not English.
  MHINE? Not English.

So practically, THINE and WHINE are the only two realistic options.

We have to pick one.

Alternatively, we can use a guess to test multiple possibilities? But we can't because we cannot avoid the known positions without wasting the information.

For instance, if we guess a word that doesn't have H in position 2, then we would break the known pattern, and the feedback would be chaotic. Moreover, it might not be a valid word because the known positions must be fixed.

Therefore, we should guess THINE or WHINE.

Which one to choose?

We might consider that the first letter should be a letter that hasn't been excluded. We haven't tested T or W.

We could flip a coin, but let's think: THINE is less common than WHINE? Actually, WHINE is a more common word.

Perhaps WHINE is more likely? But we don't know.

We can also consider the first guess: ""crane"" had common letters, and now we have two options.

But we have no data on T or W.

So I'll choose WHINE arbitrarily since it's a common word.

But note: the feedback will tell us immediately if we are correct or not. And if we are incorrect (if the word is THINE), then we know it must be THINE.

Similarly, if we guess WHINE and it's wrong, then the next guess must be THINE.

So we can choose either without much loss.

I'll choose WHINE for this guess.

But let me double-check: 
  If the secret word is WHINE: 
      Our guess: W H I N E -> Feedback: W(✓) H(✓) I(✓) N(✓) E(✓) -> solved.
  If the secret word is THINE:
      We guess WHINE: Feedback: W(x) H(✓) I(✓) N(✓) E(✓) -> then we know the first letter is not W, so we guess THINE next.

Similarly, if we guessed THINE and it was WHINE, we'd get: T(x) H(✓) I(✓) N(✓) E(✓), and then we'd guess WHINE next.

So no harm.

I think WHINE might be more common.

Therefore, I'll guess WHINE.
</think>
After analyzing the feedback:
- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C, R, and A are absent (x), while N and E are correct (✓) in positions 4 and 5.
- From Guess 2 (""shine""): S is absent (x), while H, I, N, and E are correct (✓) in positions 2, 3, 4, and 5.

This reveals:
1. The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ H I N E` (positions 2–5 confirmed).
2. Excluded letters are: **C, R, A, S**.
3. The only unknown is the **first letter**, which must be a valid English letter not excluded and form a real word.

Possible candidate words include:
- **WHINE** (a common word meaning a high-pitched complaint)
- **THINE** (an archaic term meaning ""yours"")

Both are valid 5-letter options fitting the pattern. Since ""WHINE"" is more frequently used in modern English, I prioritize it for efficiency. Guessing ""WHINE"" maximizes the chance of solving the word immediately (e.g., if correct) or narrowing it to ""THINE"" next (if incorrect, since ""WHINE"" proves the first letter isn't W).

<guess>whine</guess>",whine,"We are given feedback from the second guess ""shine"":
  S: x (not in the word)
  H: ✓ (correct position, so H is the 2nd letter in the secret word)
  I: ✓ (correct position, so I is the 3rd letter)
  N: ✓ (correct position, so N is the 4th letter)
  E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the 5th letter)

Therefore, we know three more things:
  The secret word has the form: _ H I N E (since positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 are fixed as H, I, N, E).
  The first letter is unknown and must be a letter that we haven't eliminated.
  Additionally, S is not in the word.

From the first guess, we also know that C, R, A are not in the word (they were marked 'x').

So, the secret word is of the form: ? H I N E

The first letter (position 1) must be one of the letters we haven't tried and not excluded.

Excluded letters so far: C, R, A, S.

We have tried: C, R, A, N, E (from guess 1) and S, H, I (from guess 2). But note that H and I are in the word and in correct positions, and N and E are also confirmed.

The first letter must be a letter that:
  - Is not in the excluded list: so not C, R, A, S.
  - And it must form a valid English word when placed before ""HINE"".

We must consider only the letters that are left.

Possible letters for the first position: 
  All letters except the ones we know are absent: C, R, A, S, and also note that letters already placed (H, I, N, E) might be duplicated? But let's see.

We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, since the first position is the only unknown, and we have no indication that there are duplicates, we should consider words that start with a letter not excluding.

List possible candidates: words that end with HINE? Actually, the word is ""?HINE"".

We need a 5-letter word that ends with ""HINE"" (positions 2-5: H, I, N, E). So the only missing letter is the first character.

What words are there that match this pattern?

  - THINE: an old word meaning ""yours"" (possessive form). T is not excluded? T hasn't been tried.

  - Other possibilities: 
      WHINE: meaning to complain. W is not excluded.
      SHINE: we tried and it was wrong because the first letter S was absent. So we cannot use SHINE again.

But we also have:
  - CHINE: but C is excluded (from first guess) -> invalid.
  - RHINE: but R is excluded -> invalid.

So possible words: 
  - THINE
  - WHINE
  - PHINE? Not a common word.
  - AHINE? A is excluded.

Are there others? 
  - OHINE? Not a word.
  - DHINE? Not a word.
  - BHINE? Not a word.

So common words: THINE and WHINE.

But we need to verify: 
  THINE: T H I N E -> valid, meaning ""yours"" (old English).
  WHINE: W H I N E -> valid, meaning a long high-pitched cry or complaint.

Also, note that the first guess said A is not in the word, so no word with A.

But our word must have the form: ? H I N E.

We have two strong candidates: THINE and WHINE.

However, we have only one position unknown, so we need to guess one of these.

But note: we have tried S? Yes, and it was absent. T and W haven't been tried.

We can choose either.

But we also need to consider that if we guess THINE or WHINE, we might solve it if it's correct, or we'll know.

But we have 4 tries left (this is the third guess). Let's try THINE? Or WHINE?

We have no information about T or W. So we can choose arbitrarily.

Since T is more common than W, perhaps THINE is more likely? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests other letters? But note: we only have to fill the first position. We cannot change the rest because they are confirmed correct.

For example, if we guess a word like ""WHINE"", it must be of the exact pattern: ? H I N E. So we cannot change the other letters.

Therefore, we must guess a word that has H, I, N, E in positions 2,3,4,5.

So the only freedom is the first letter.

Thus, we must choose between the possible words: THINE and WHINE.

There might be others? Let me think: 
  KHINE? Not English.
  XHINE? Not English.
  MHINE? Not English.

So practically, THINE and WHINE are the only two realistic options.

We have to pick one.

Alternatively, we can use a guess to test multiple possibilities? But we can't because we cannot avoid the known positions without wasting the information.

For instance, if we guess a word that doesn't have H in position 2, then we would break the known pattern, and the feedback would be chaotic. Moreover, it might not be a valid word because the known positions must be fixed.

Therefore, we should guess THINE or WHINE.

Which one to choose?

We might consider that the first letter should be a letter that hasn't been excluded. We haven't tested T or W.

We could flip a coin, but let's think: THINE is less common than WHINE? Actually, WHINE is a more common word.

Perhaps WHINE is more likely? But we don't know.

We can also consider the first guess: ""crane"" had common letters, and now we have two options.

But we have no data on T or W.

So I'll choose WHINE arbitrarily since it's a common word.

But note: the feedback will tell us immediately if we are correct or not. And if we are incorrect (if the word is THINE), then we know it must be THINE.

Similarly, if we guess WHINE and it's wrong, then the next guess must be THINE.

So we can choose either without much loss.

I'll choose WHINE for this guess.

But let me double-check: 
  If the secret word is WHINE: 
      Our guess: W H I N E -> Feedback: W(✓) H(✓) I(✓) N(✓) E(✓) -> solved.
  If the secret word is THINE:
      We guess WHINE: Feedback: W(x) H(✓) I(✓) N(✓) E(✓) -> then we know the first letter is not W, so we guess THINE next.

Similarly, if we guessed THINE and it was WHINE, we'd get: T(x) H(✓) I(✓) N(✓) E(✓), and then we'd guess WHINE next.

So no harm.

I think WHINE might be more common.

Therefore, I'll guess WHINE.After analyzing the feedback:
- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C, R, and A are absent (x), while N and E are correct (✓) in positions 4 and 5.
- From Guess 2 (""shine""): S is absent (x), while H, I, N, and E are correct (✓) in positions 2, 3, 4, and 5.

This reveals:
1. The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ H I N E` (positions 2–5 confirmed).
2. Excluded letters are: **C, R, A, S**.
3. The only unknown is the **first letter**, which must be a valid English letter not excluded and form a real word.

Possible candidate words include:
- **WHINE** (a common word meaning a high-pitched complaint)
- **THINE** (an archaic term meaning ""yours"")

Both are valid 5-letter options fitting the pattern. Since ""WHINE"" is more frequently used in modern English, I prioritize it for efficiency. Guessing ""WHINE"" maximizes the chance of solving the word immediately (e.g., if correct) or narrowing it to ""THINE"" next (if incorrect, since ""WHINE"" proves the first letter isn't W).",Guess 3: whine -> FEEDBACK: W(✓) H(✓) I(✓) N(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
