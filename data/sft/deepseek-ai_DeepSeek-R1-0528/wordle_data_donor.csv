First, I need to make the first guess for a Wordle game. Since I don't have any information yet, I should start with a word that has common letters to maximize the feedback I get.

Common vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U. Common consonants include R, S, T, L, N, etc. A good starter word often uses several of these to cover more possibilities.

Popular first guesses in Wordle are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", or ""ADIEU"". These use a mix of vowels and common consonants.

I should choose a word that has no repeating letters since that could waste a guess if letters are unique.

Let me list out some options:

- ""CRANE"": C, R, A, N, E – has A and E vowels, R and N common consonants.

- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – similar, with S,T,L.

- ""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T – has O instead of E.

""ADIEU"" has A,I,E,U which are vowels, but it misses some consonants, so it might not be as balanced.

Another good one is ""RADIO"" or ""MEDIA"".

I think ""CRANE"" is often recommended because it covers C,R,A,N,E – all common letters.

Alternatives: ""SALET"" is a word, but less common.

Since I need a valid English word, I'll stick with common ones.

Let me go with ""CRANE"". It's a solid choice for a first guess.

So, my guess will be ""CRANE"".

Now, for the response format, I need to output my thought process within <think> <thinking></think> tags, and then the guess in <guess>CRANE</guess>.

The user said ""Make your first 5-letter word guess,"" so I should provide the thinking as required.

In my thinking, I should reason step by step.

Thought process:

- Start with a word that has high-frequency letters to get useful feedback.

- Aim for a mix of vowels and consonants.

- Avoid repeated letters.

- Choose a word like ""CRANE"" that's commonly used in Wordle.

- Based on that, select ""CRANE"" as the first guess.

Then, output the guess in the specified format.
</think>
In Wordle, the first guess is crucial for gathering information about the secret word. Since no prior feedback exists, I need to choose a starter word that maximizes the potential for useful feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of possibilities. Common vowels in English include A, E, I, O, U, and frequent consonants include R, S, T, L, N. 

I should avoid words with repeating letters to cover more unique characters. Popular first guesses in Wordle are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"", which incorporate several high-frequency letters. Among these, ""CRANE"" stands out because it contains:
- Three vowels (A and E) to test common vowel placements.
- Two common consonants (C, R, N) that often appear in English words.
- All unique letters, ensuring no redundancy.

This choice provides a balanced approach to narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback symbols (✓ for correct position, - for correct letter wrong position, x for incorrect letter).

Thus, I'll start with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

We are given feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(x)
 So, the secret word has the letter R and N somewhere, but not in those positions (since they are marked minus), and does not have C, A, or E.

 Specifically:
   - C is not in the secret word (marked x)
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (since our guess was C-R-A-N-E, and positions are 1-based? or 0-based? Actually, in the feedback, we say position of R is 2? Let's index from 1: position 1=C, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=E).

 But note: the secret word has R, but not at position 2, and has N, but not at position 4. Also, the letters C, A, and E are absent.

 Now, we know that R and N are in the word, so we must include them in our next guess. And avoid C, A, E.

 Also, we have 5 positions to guess. We need to choose a word with R and N, but not C, A, E.

 Additionally, R cannot be in position 2 and N cannot be in position 4.

 Let's think of words that include R and N, and try to cover new common letters.

 What are other common letters? We can try to use vowels that haven't been checked. We didn't check O, U, I, etc. And consonants like T, L, S, D, etc.

 Our new guess should have R and N, put them in different positions than before (so R not at spot 2, N not at spot 4), and include three new letters that are possible.

 We also want to avoid A and E (since absent) and C (absent).

 Possible candidate: ""R"" must be somewhere else, say positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: if we put R at position 1, that might be a possibility. Similarly for N, we can put it at positions 1,2,3,5? (but in guess we can try any position).

 However, we must use valid English words.

 Let me brainstorm words with R and N, and excluding A, E, C.

 Examples:
   - ""HORNS"": H, O, R, N, S -> but we have O which is a new vowel, and S common.
   - ""BORNS"": not valid word? Actually, borns is not common, but ""barns"" has A which is excluded.
   - ""PORNS"": that might be sensitive and probably not suitable? Avoid.
   - ""WORNS"": not valid? Perhaps ""worn"" is base, but we need 5 letters.

   - Another: ""DARN"" but that's 4 letters. We need 5.

   - ""TORN"": only 4 letters.

   - ""RUNTY"": but has Y and T, and 5 letters? Actually, ""runty"" is an adjective meaning small and weak, valid.

   However, we don't have many letters covered. Let's try to include another vowel?

   Since A and E are out, we can try I, O, U.

 Let me think: ""PRINT"": P, R, I, N, T -> has R and N? R at position 2? But in our first guess R was at pos2 and it was minus meaning not there. So in ""PRINT"", R is at pos2? We cannot put R at position 2. So ""PRINT"" would put R again at the same position which is bad because we know R is not at position 2.

 We must avoid putting R at position 2.

 Similarly, avoid N at position 4.

 So ""PRINT"" is not good then? But if we change the position: let's see if we can move R elsewhere.

 Alternatively, ""ROUND"": R, O, U, N, D -> R is at position 1? Then N is at position 4? But we cannot put N at position 4 because that was the position where we had N and it was minus, meaning N is in the word but not at position 4.

 So if we put N at position 4 in this guess, it would be invalid because we know it's not there. Therefore, we must avoid that.

 Therefore, in ""ROUND"": 
   position 1: R -> R cannot be at position 1? No, we don't know about position 1 yet. Only that R cannot be at position 2 (from previous guess). So putting R at 1 is okay? But wait: when we had CRANE, R was at position 2 and got minus. So R must be at a position other than 2. Similarly, N must be at a position other than 4.

 ""ROUND"" has R at position 1 (which is new) and N at position 4? Not allowed because from the first guess, N was at position 4 and marked minus meaning it cannot be at position 4. So ""ROUND"" would have N at position 4 again? That would be bad.

 Therefore, skip ""ROUND"".

 What about ""SPURN"": S, P, U, R, N -> positions: 1-S,2-P,3-U,4-R,5-N? 
   Then R is at position 4 -> which is different than position 2? Yes. And N is at position 5 -> different from position 4? Yes. 
   So this would be acceptable.

 Is ""spurn"" a word? Yes: verb meaning to reject with disdain.

 Also, we introduce new letters: S, P, U, and we already know R and N.

 But note: we excluded C, A, E. S and P are common consonants, U is a vowel.

 So let's consider:

   Previous absent letters: C, A, E -> so S, P, U are not C,A,E -> acceptable.

   Now, we are also avoiding putting R at the wrong position? Yes: we have R at position 4 which is new.

   And N at position 5 (new).

 So ""SPURN"" seems good.

 Another option: ""BURNS"": B,U,R,N,S -> positions: 1-B,2-U,3-R,4-N,5-S. 
   But then N is at position 4? But our first guess had N at position 4 and it was marked minus, meaning N cannot be at position 4. So we must avoid? Yes.

 Therefore, ""BURNS"" is invalid because it puts N at position 4.

 Similarly, ""GRIND"": G,R,I,N,D -> Positions: 1-G,2-R (we know R cannot be at position 2, so no), 3-I,4-N (but we know N cannot be at position 4). So avoid.

 How about ""GRUNT"": G,R,U,N,T -> positions: 1-G,2-R (cannot put R at 2 -> not allowed). So skip.

 Another: ""DRUNK"": D,R,U,N,K -> but R is at position 2? Avoid.

 ""URN"" related words? ""URINE"": U,R,I,N,E -> but E cannot be used because it's absent? No, the first feedback said E(x) meaning E is absent. So we cannot use E.

 So avoid ""URINE"".

 How about ""TRUNK"": T,R,U,N,K -> but R at position 2? Not allowed.

 Alternatively, let's put R in positions other than 2: either 1,3,4,5.

 Similarly, N in positions other than 4: 1,2,3,5.

 Consider ""PRUNS"": not common, maybe prune without e? Not valid.

 Another: ""ROUNDS"": 6 letters? No.

 A better one: ""SYRUP"": only 5 letters? Yes, but doesn't have N? Wait, we must include N because we know N is in the word.

 We cannot omit N because we must confirm where it is. Similarly for R.

 So we must include both R and N.

 Let's try ""RINDS"": R,I,N,D,S -> positions: 1-R, 2-I, 3-N (so N at position 3? That's new), 4-D,5-S. Now, R is at position 1 (not 2) -> okay. N at position 3 (not 4) -> okay. And letters: don't use C,A,E -> good.

 But we have R at position 1. Is that allowed? Yes, because the only constraint is R not at 2, so it could be at 1.

 Also, ""rinds"" is a word (e.g., orange rinds).

 Alternatively, ""NURSE"": N,U,R,S,E -> but E is absent (first feedback E marked x) so we cannot use E.

 Another: ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N -> positions: 1-M, 2-O, 3-U, 4-R, 5-N -> this is interesting: 
   R is at position 4 (not 2), N at position 5 (not 4) -> okay. 
   Letters: M, O, U, R, N -> no C,A,E -> valid.

 Is ""mourn"" a valid word? Yes.

 How about ""SPIRN"": not a word. Or ""HORNY"": H,O,R,N,Y -> positions: 1-H,2-O,3-R (R at position 3 -> not 2),4-N (but we cannot put N at position 4) -> skip because N at 4 is disallowed.

 Wait, in ""HORNY"", N is at position 4? Which is forbidden.

 So avoid.

 Now between ""MOURN"" and ""SPURN"", both seem valid? I also thought of ""RINDS"".

 Let me check if ""MOURN"" is 5 letters: yes. ""SPURN"": yes. ""RINDS"": yes.

 Which one to choose? We want to cover new letters. 

 First guess letters: C,R,A,N,E -> we have used R and N. 

 For second guess, we want to cover letters that are not tested: in ""MOURN"": we cover M, O, U, R, N -> R and N are repeated, so new: M, O, U.

 In ""SPURN"": S, P, U, R, N -> new: S, P, U.

 In ""RINDS"": R, I, N, D, S -> new: I, D, S.

 Which letters are more common?

 Among consonants: S, T, L, etc., vowels: O, U, I.

 Probably ""SPURN"" covers S, P (two consonants) and U (vowel). ""MOURN"" has M which is less common? But U and O are vowels.

 Since we haven't tested O, I, U, we might want to test one vowel? 

 Alternatively, to avoid potential duplication of letters? The secret word might not have duplicates, but we don't know.

 Actually, Wordle can have duplicate letters? However, the feedback might show duplicated feedback? But in Wordle, if a letter appears twice but the secret only has one, then the second one might show as yellow or gray? But we don't know yet.

 But our first guess had no duplicates, and we got two yellow letters (R and N). So the word has R and N exactly? Or maybe it has duplicates? But we don't know.

 To be safe, we should choose a word without duplicates if possible.

 Also, note that ""SPURN"" has letters S, P, U, R, N: all distinct? Yes.

 ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N: distinct.

 ""RINDS"": R,I,N,D,S: distinct.

 Now, which word gives us more information? Covering more common letters.

 I think ""SPURN"" might be better because it includes S which is very common. P is common but less than some others. U is a vowel.

 Compare to ""RINDS"": includes I (vowel) and D,S. 

 Another candidate: ""WORDS"": but has O, and S, but doesn't have N? Must have N.

 Because we know N is in the word. So words without N are invalid.

 We must use both R and N.

 I will go with ""SPURN"" as it covers S, P, U (new letters) and R, N (known) in new positions.

 So guess: SPURN

 Format our response.

 First, we do the reasoning above, then output.

 We say:
 <thinking>
 We have feedback from CRANE: C absent, R present but not in position 2, A absent, N present but not in position 4, E absent.
 Therefore, next guess must include R and N (placed in positions other than 2 and 4 respectively) and avoid C,A,E.
 We choose ""SPURN"": places R at position 4 (new) and N at position 5 (new). It introduces new letters S, P, U. It avoids the forbidden letters and positions.
 </thinking>
 Then: <guess>SPURN</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (C[x], R[-], A[x], N[-], E[x]), we know:
- R and N are in the secret word but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
- C, A, and E are absent from the word.

For the next guess:
- Must include R and N, placed in new positions (avoiding position 2 for R and position 4 for N).
- Avoid using C, A, E.
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.

After considering options like ""MOURN"" and ""RINDS"", ""SPURN"" was selected because:
- Positions: R at position 4 (≠2) and N at position 5 (≠4).
- Uses new letters: S, P, U (common consonants and a vowel).
- Valid 5-letter word meaning ""to reject disdainfully"".

<guess>SPURN</guess>",SPURN,"We are given feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(x)
 So, the secret word has the letter R and N somewhere, but not in those positions (since they are marked minus), and does not have C, A, or E.

 Specifically:
   - C is not in the secret word (marked x)
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (since our guess was C-R-A-N-E, and positions are 1-based? or 0-based? Actually, in the feedback, we say position of R is 2? Let's index from 1: position 1=C, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=E).

 But note: the secret word has R, but not at position 2, and has N, but not at position 4. Also, the letters C, A, and E are absent.

 Now, we know that R and N are in the word, so we must include them in our next guess. And avoid C, A, E.

 Also, we have 5 positions to guess. We need to choose a word with R and N, but not C, A, E.

 Additionally, R cannot be in position 2 and N cannot be in position 4.

 Let's think of words that include R and N, and try to cover new common letters.

 What are other common letters? We can try to use vowels that haven't been checked. We didn't check O, U, I, etc. And consonants like T, L, S, D, etc.

 Our new guess should have R and N, put them in different positions than before (so R not at spot 2, N not at spot 4), and include three new letters that are possible.

 We also want to avoid A and E (since absent) and C (absent).

 Possible candidate: ""R"" must be somewhere else, say positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: if we put R at position 1, that might be a possibility. Similarly for N, we can put it at positions 1,2,3,5? (but in guess we can try any position).

 However, we must use valid English words.

 Let me brainstorm words with R and N, and excluding A, E, C.

 Examples:
   - ""HORNS"": H, O, R, N, S -> but we have O which is a new vowel, and S common.
   - ""BORNS"": not valid word? Actually, borns is not common, but ""barns"" has A which is excluded.
   - ""PORNS"": that might be sensitive and probably not suitable? Avoid.
   - ""WORNS"": not valid? Perhaps ""worn"" is base, but we need 5 letters.

   - Another: ""DARN"" but that's 4 letters. We need 5.

   - ""TORN"": only 4 letters.

   - ""RUNTY"": but has Y and T, and 5 letters? Actually, ""runty"" is an adjective meaning small and weak, valid.

   However, we don't have many letters covered. Let's try to include another vowel?

   Since A and E are out, we can try I, O, U.

 Let me think: ""PRINT"": P, R, I, N, T -> has R and N? R at position 2? But in our first guess R was at pos2 and it was minus meaning not there. So in ""PRINT"", R is at pos2? We cannot put R at position 2. So ""PRINT"" would put R again at the same position which is bad because we know R is not at position 2.

 We must avoid putting R at position 2.

 Similarly, avoid N at position 4.

 So ""PRINT"" is not good then? But if we change the position: let's see if we can move R elsewhere.

 Alternatively, ""ROUND"": R, O, U, N, D -> R is at position 1? Then N is at position 4? But we cannot put N at position 4 because that was the position where we had N and it was minus, meaning N is in the word but not at position 4.

 So if we put N at position 4 in this guess, it would be invalid because we know it's not there. Therefore, we must avoid that.

 Therefore, in ""ROUND"": 
   position 1: R -> R cannot be at position 1? No, we don't know about position 1 yet. Only that R cannot be at position 2 (from previous guess). So putting R at 1 is okay? But wait: when we had CRANE, R was at position 2 and got minus. So R must be at a position other than 2. Similarly, N must be at a position other than 4.

 ""ROUND"" has R at position 1 (which is new) and N at position 4? Not allowed because from the first guess, N was at position 4 and marked minus meaning it cannot be at position 4. So ""ROUND"" would have N at position 4 again? That would be bad.

 Therefore, skip ""ROUND"".

 What about ""SPURN"": S, P, U, R, N -> positions: 1-S,2-P,3-U,4-R,5-N? 
   Then R is at position 4 -> which is different than position 2? Yes. And N is at position 5 -> different from position 4? Yes. 
   So this would be acceptable.

 Is ""spurn"" a word? Yes: verb meaning to reject with disdain.

 Also, we introduce new letters: S, P, U, and we already know R and N.

 But note: we excluded C, A, E. S and P are common consonants, U is a vowel.

 So let's consider:

   Previous absent letters: C, A, E -> so S, P, U are not C,A,E -> acceptable.

   Now, we are also avoiding putting R at the wrong position? Yes: we have R at position 4 which is new.

   And N at position 5 (new).

 So ""SPURN"" seems good.

 Another option: ""BURNS"": B,U,R,N,S -> positions: 1-B,2-U,3-R,4-N,5-S. 
   But then N is at position 4? But our first guess had N at position 4 and it was marked minus, meaning N cannot be at position 4. So we must avoid? Yes.

 Therefore, ""BURNS"" is invalid because it puts N at position 4.

 Similarly, ""GRIND"": G,R,I,N,D -> Positions: 1-G,2-R (we know R cannot be at position 2, so no), 3-I,4-N (but we know N cannot be at position 4). So avoid.

 How about ""GRUNT"": G,R,U,N,T -> positions: 1-G,2-R (cannot put R at 2 -> not allowed). So skip.

 Another: ""DRUNK"": D,R,U,N,K -> but R is at position 2? Avoid.

 ""URN"" related words? ""URINE"": U,R,I,N,E -> but E cannot be used because it's absent? No, the first feedback said E(x) meaning E is absent. So we cannot use E.

 So avoid ""URINE"".

 How about ""TRUNK"": T,R,U,N,K -> but R at position 2? Not allowed.

 Alternatively, let's put R in positions other than 2: either 1,3,4,5.

 Similarly, N in positions other than 4: 1,2,3,5.

 Consider ""PRUNS"": not common, maybe prune without e? Not valid.

 Another: ""ROUNDS"": 6 letters? No.

 A better one: ""SYRUP"": only 5 letters? Yes, but doesn't have N? Wait, we must include N because we know N is in the word.

 We cannot omit N because we must confirm where it is. Similarly for R.

 So we must include both R and N.

 Let's try ""RINDS"": R,I,N,D,S -> positions: 1-R, 2-I, 3-N (so N at position 3? That's new), 4-D,5-S. Now, R is at position 1 (not 2) -> okay. N at position 3 (not 4) -> okay. And letters: don't use C,A,E -> good.

 But we have R at position 1. Is that allowed? Yes, because the only constraint is R not at 2, so it could be at 1.

 Also, ""rinds"" is a word (e.g., orange rinds).

 Alternatively, ""NURSE"": N,U,R,S,E -> but E is absent (first feedback E marked x) so we cannot use E.

 Another: ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N -> positions: 1-M, 2-O, 3-U, 4-R, 5-N -> this is interesting: 
   R is at position 4 (not 2), N at position 5 (not 4) -> okay. 
   Letters: M, O, U, R, N -> no C,A,E -> valid.

 Is ""mourn"" a valid word? Yes.

 How about ""SPIRN"": not a word. Or ""HORNY"": H,O,R,N,Y -> positions: 1-H,2-O,3-R (R at position 3 -> not 2),4-N (but we cannot put N at position 4) -> skip because N at 4 is disallowed.

 Wait, in ""HORNY"", N is at position 4? Which is forbidden.

 So avoid.

 Now between ""MOURN"" and ""SPURN"", both seem valid? I also thought of ""RINDS"".

 Let me check if ""MOURN"" is 5 letters: yes. ""SPURN"": yes. ""RINDS"": yes.

 Which one to choose? We want to cover new letters. 

 First guess letters: C,R,A,N,E -> we have used R and N. 

 For second guess, we want to cover letters that are not tested: in ""MOURN"": we cover M, O, U, R, N -> R and N are repeated, so new: M, O, U.

 In ""SPURN"": S, P, U, R, N -> new: S, P, U.

 In ""RINDS"": R, I, N, D, S -> new: I, D, S.

 Which letters are more common?

 Among consonants: S, T, L, etc., vowels: O, U, I.

 Probably ""SPURN"" covers S, P (two consonants) and U (vowel). ""MOURN"" has M which is less common? But U and O are vowels.

 Since we haven't tested O, I, U, we might want to test one vowel? 

 Alternatively, to avoid potential duplication of letters? The secret word might not have duplicates, but we don't know.

 Actually, Wordle can have duplicate letters? However, the feedback might show duplicated feedback? But in Wordle, if a letter appears twice but the secret only has one, then the second one might show as yellow or gray? But we don't know yet.

 But our first guess had no duplicates, and we got two yellow letters (R and N). So the word has R and N exactly? Or maybe it has duplicates? But we don't know.

 To be safe, we should choose a word without duplicates if possible.

 Also, note that ""SPURN"" has letters S, P, U, R, N: all distinct? Yes.

 ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N: distinct.

 ""RINDS"": R,I,N,D,S: distinct.

 Now, which word gives us more information? Covering more common letters.

 I think ""SPURN"" might be better because it includes S which is very common. P is common but less than some others. U is a vowel.

 Compare to ""RINDS"": includes I (vowel) and D,S. 

 Another candidate: ""WORDS"": but has O, and S, but doesn't have N? Must have N.

 Because we know N is in the word. So words without N are invalid.

 We must use both R and N.

 I will go with ""SPURN"" as it covers S, P, U (new letters) and R, N (known) in new positions.

 So guess: SPURN

 Format our response.

 First, we do the reasoning above, then output.

 We say:
 <thinking>
 We have feedback from CRANE: C absent, R present but not in position 2, A absent, N present but not in position 4, E absent.
 Therefore, next guess must include R and N (placed in positions other than 2 and 4 respectively) and avoid C,A,E.
 We choose ""SPURN"": places R at position 4 (new) and N at position 5 (new). It introduces new letters S, P, U. It avoids the forbidden letters and positions.
 </thinking>
 Then: <guess>SPURN</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (C[x], R[-], A[x], N[-], E[x]), we know:
- R and N are in the secret word but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
- C, A, and E are absent from the word.

For the next guess:
- Must include R and N, placed in new positions (avoiding position 2 for R and position 4 for N).
- Avoid using C, A, E.
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.

After considering options like ""MOURN"" and ""RINDS"", ""SPURN"" was selected because:
- Positions: R at position 4 (≠2) and N at position 5 (≠4).
- Uses new letters: S, P, U (common consonants and a vowel).
- Valid 5-letter word meaning ""to reject disdainfully"".",Guess 2: SPURN -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) U(x) R(-) N(-),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to make the first guess for a Wordle game. Since I don't have any information yet, I should start with a word that has common letters to maximize the feedback I get.

Common vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U. Common consonants include R, S, T, L, N, etc. A good starter word often uses several of these to cover more possibilities.

Popular first guesses in Wordle are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", or ""ADIEU"". These use a mix of vowels and common consonants.

I should choose a word that has no repeating letters since that could waste a guess if letters are unique.

Let me list out some options:

- ""CRANE"": C, R, A, N, E – has A and E vowels, R and N common consonants.

- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – similar, with S,T,L.

- ""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T – has O instead of E.

""ADIEU"" has A,I,E,U which are vowels, but it misses some consonants, so it might not be as balanced.

Another good one is ""RADIO"" or ""MEDIA"".

I think ""CRANE"" is often recommended because it covers C,R,A,N,E – all common letters.

Alternatives: ""SALET"" is a word, but less common.

Since I need a valid English word, I'll stick with common ones.

Let me go with ""CRANE"". It's a solid choice for a first guess.

So, my guess will be ""CRANE"".

Now, for the response format, I need to output my thought process within <think> <thinking>tags, and then the guess in

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(x)
 So, the secret word has the letter R and N somewhere, but not in those positions (since they are marked minus), and does not have C, A, or E.

 Specifically:
   - C is not in the secret word (marked x)
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (since our guess was C-R-A-N-E, and positions are 1-based? or 0-based? Actually, in the feedback, we say position of R is 2? Let's index from 1: position 1=C, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=E).

 But note: the secret word has R, but not at position 2, and has N, but not at position 4. Also, the letters C, A, and E are absent.

 Now, we know that R and N are in the word, so we must include them in our next guess. And avoid C, A, E.

 Also, we have 5 positions to guess. We need to choose a word with R and N, but not C, A, E.

 Additionally, R cannot be in position 2 and N cannot be in position 4.

 Let's think of words that include R and N, and try to cover new common letters.

 What are other common letters? We can try to use vowels that haven't been checked. We didn't check O, U, I, etc. And consonants like T, L, S, D, etc.

 Our new guess should have R and N, put them in different positions than before (so R not at spot 2, N not at spot 4), and include three new letters that are possible.

 We also want to avoid A and E (since absent) and C (absent).

 Possible candidate: ""R"" must be somewhere else, say positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: if we put R at position 1, that might be a possibility. Similarly for N, we can put it at positions 1,2,3,5? (but in guess we can try any position).

 However, we must use valid English words.

 Let me brainstorm words with R and N, and excluding A, E, C.

 Examples:
   - ""HORNS"": H, O, R, N, S -> but we have O which is a new vowel, and S common.
   - ""BORNS"": not valid word? Actually, borns is not common, but ""barns"" has A which is excluded.
   - ""PORNS"": that might be sensitive and probably not suitable? Avoid.
   - ""WORNS"": not valid? Perhaps ""worn"" is base, but we need 5 letters.

   - Another: ""DARN"" but that's 4 letters. We need 5.

   - ""TORN"": only 4 letters.

   - ""RUNTY"": but has Y and T, and 5 letters? Actually, ""runty"" is an adjective meaning small and weak, valid.

   However, we don't have many letters covered. Let's try to include another vowel?

   Since A and E are out, we can try I, O, U.

 Let me think: ""PRINT"": P, R, I, N, T -> has R and N? R at position 2? But in our first guess R was at pos2 and it was minus meaning not there. So in ""PRINT"", R is at pos2? We cannot put R at position 2. So ""PRINT"" would put R again at the same position which is bad because we know R is not at position 2.

 We must avoid putting R at position 2.

 Similarly, avoid N at position 4.

 So ""PRINT"" is not good then? But if we change the position: let's see if we can move R elsewhere.

 Alternatively, ""ROUND"": R, O, U, N, D -> R is at position 1? Then N is at position 4? But we cannot put N at position 4 because that was the position where we had N and it was minus, meaning N is in the word but not at position 4.

 So if we put N at position 4 in this guess, it would be invalid because we know it's not there. Therefore, we must avoid that.

 Therefore, in ""ROUND"": 
   position 1: R -> R cannot be at position 1? No, we don't know about position 1 yet. Only that R cannot be at position 2 (from previous guess). So putting R at 1 is okay? But wait: when we had CRANE, R was at position 2 and got minus. So R must be at a position other than 2. Similarly, N must be at a position other than 4.

 ""ROUND"" has R at position 1 (which is new) and N at position 4? Not allowed because from the first guess, N was at position 4 and marked minus meaning it cannot be at position 4. So ""ROUND"" would have N at position 4 again? That would be bad.

 Therefore, skip ""ROUND"".

 What about ""SPURN"": S, P, U, R, N -> positions: 1-S,2-P,3-U,4-R,5-N? 
   Then R is at position 4 -> which is different than position 2? Yes. And N is at position 5 -> different from position 4? Yes. 
   So this would be acceptable.

 Is ""spurn"" a word? Yes: verb meaning to reject with disdain.

 Also, we introduce new letters: S, P, U, and we already know R and N.

 But note: we excluded C, A, E. S and P are common consonants, U is a vowel.

 So let's consider:

   Previous absent letters: C, A, E -> so S, P, U are not C,A,E -> acceptable.

   Now, we are also avoiding putting R at the wrong position? Yes: we have R at position 4 which is new.

   And N at position 5 (new).

 So ""SPURN"" seems good.

 Another option: ""BURNS"": B,U,R,N,S -> positions: 1-B,2-U,3-R,4-N,5-S. 
   But then N is at position 4? But our first guess had N at position 4 and it was marked minus, meaning N cannot be at position 4. So we must avoid? Yes.

 Therefore, ""BURNS"" is invalid because it puts N at position 4.

 Similarly, ""GRIND"": G,R,I,N,D -> Positions: 1-G,2-R (we know R cannot be at position 2, so no), 3-I,4-N (but we know N cannot be at position 4). So avoid.

 How about ""GRUNT"": G,R,U,N,T -> positions: 1-G,2-R (cannot put R at 2 -> not allowed). So skip.

 Another: ""DRUNK"": D,R,U,N,K -> but R is at position 2? Avoid.

 ""URN"" related words? ""URINE"": U,R,I,N,E -> but E cannot be used because it's absent? No, the first feedback said E(x) meaning E is absent. So we cannot use E.

 So avoid ""URINE"".

 How about ""TRUNK"": T,R,U,N,K -> but R at position 2? Not allowed.

 Alternatively, let's put R in positions other than 2: either 1,3,4,5.

 Similarly, N in positions other than 4: 1,2,3,5.

 Consider ""PRUNS"": not common, maybe prune without e? Not valid.

 Another: ""ROUNDS"": 6 letters? No.

 A better one: ""SYRUP"": only 5 letters? Yes, but doesn't have N? Wait, we must include N because we know N is in the word.

 We cannot omit N because we must confirm where it is. Similarly for R.

 So we must include both R and N.

 Let's try ""RINDS"": R,I,N,D,S -> positions: 1-R, 2-I, 3-N (so N at position 3? That's new), 4-D,5-S. Now, R is at position 1 (not 2) -> okay. N at position 3 (not 4) -> okay. And letters: don't use C,A,E -> good.

 But we have R at position 1. Is that allowed? Yes, because the only constraint is R not at 2, so it could be at 1.

 Also, ""rinds"" is a word (e.g., orange rinds).

 Alternatively, ""NURSE"": N,U,R,S,E -> but E is absent (first feedback E marked x) so we cannot use E.

 Another: ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N -> positions: 1-M, 2-O, 3-U, 4-R, 5-N -> this is interesting: 
   R is at position 4 (not 2), N at position 5 (not 4) -> okay. 
   Letters: M, O, U, R, N -> no C,A,E -> valid.

 Is ""mourn"" a valid word? Yes.

 How about ""SPIRN"": not a word. Or ""HORNY"": H,O,R,N,Y -> positions: 1-H,2-O,3-R (R at position 3 -> not 2),4-N (but we cannot put N at position 4) -> skip because N at 4 is disallowed.

 Wait, in ""HORNY"", N is at position 4? Which is forbidden.

 So avoid.

 Now between ""MOURN"" and ""SPURN"", both seem valid? I also thought of ""RINDS"".

 Let me check if ""MOURN"" is 5 letters: yes. ""SPURN"": yes. ""RINDS"": yes.

 Which one to choose? We want to cover new letters.

 For second guess, we want to cover letters that are not tested: in ""MOURN"": we cover M, O, U, R, N -> R and N are repeated, so new: M, O, U.

 In ""SPURN"": S, P, U, R, N -> new: S, P, U.

 In ""RINDS"": R, I, N, D, S -> new: I, D, S.

 Which letters are more common?

 Among consonants: S, T, L, etc., vowels: O, U, I.

 Probably ""SPURN"" covers S, P (two consonants) and U (vowel). ""MOURN"" has M which is less common? But U and O are vowels.

 Since we haven't tested O, I, U, we might want to test one vowel?

 Also, note that ""SPURN"" has letters S, P, U, R, N: all distinct? Yes.

 ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N: distinct.

 ""RINDS"": R,I,N,D,S: distinct.

 Now, which word gives us more information? Covering more common letters.

 I think ""SPURN"" might be better because it includes S which is very common. P is common but less than some others. U is a vowel.

 Compare to ""RINDS"": includes I (vowel) and D,S.

 Because we know N is in the word. So words without N are invalid.

Perhaps ""worn"" is base, but we need 5 letters.\n\n   - Another: ""DARN"" but that\'s 4 letters. We need 5.\n\n   - ""TORN"": only 4 letters.\n\n   - ""RUNTY"": but has Y and T, and 5 letters? Actually, ""runty"" is an adjective meaning small and weak, valid.\n\n   However, we don\'t have many letters covered. Let\'s try to include another vowel?\n\n   Since A and E are out, we can try I, O, U.\n\n Let me think: ""PRINT"": P, R, I, N, T -> has R and N? R at position 2? But in our first guess R was at pos2 and it was minus meaning not there. So in ""PRINT"", R is at pos2? We cannot put R at position 2. So ""PRINT"" would put R again at the same position which is bad because we know R is not at position 2.\n\n We must avoid putting R at position 2.\n\n Similarly, avoid N at position 4.\n\n So ""PRINT"" is not good then? But if we change the position: let\'s see if we can move R elsewhere.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROUND"": R, O, U, N, D -> R is at position 1? Then N is at position 4? But we cannot put N at position 4 because that was the position where we had N and it was minus, meaning N is in the word but not at position 4.\n\n So if we put N at position 4 in this guess, it would be invalid because we know it\'s not there. Therefore, we must avoid that.\n\n Therefore, in ""ROUND"": \n   position 1: R -> R cannot be at position 1? No, we don\'t know about position 1 yet. Only that R cannot be at position 2 (from previous guess). So putting R at 1 is okay? But wait: when we had CRANE, R was at position 2 and got minus. So R must be at a position other than 2. Similarly, N must be at a position other than 4.\n\n ""ROUND"" has R at position 1 (which is new) and N at position 4? Not allowed because from the first guess, N was at position 4 and marked minus meaning it cannot be at position 4. So ""ROUND"" would have N at position 4 again? That would be bad.\n\n Therefore, skip ""ROUND"".\n\n What about ""SPURN"": S, P, U, R, N -> positions: 1-S,2-P,3-U,4-R,5-N? \n   Then R is at position 4 -> which is different than position 2? Yes. And N is at position 5 -> different from position 4? Yes. \n   So this would be acceptable.\n\n Is ""spurn"" a word? Yes: verb meaning to reject with disdain.\n\n Also, we introduce new letters: S, P, U, and we already know R and N.\n\n But note: we excluded C, A, E. S and P are common consonants, U is a vowel.\n\n So let\'s consider:\n\n   Previous absent letters: C, A, E -> so S, P, U are not C,A,E -> acceptable.\n\n   Now, we are also avoiding putting R at the wrong position? Yes: we have R at position 4 which is new.\n\n   And N at position 5 (new).\n\n So ""SPURN"" seems good.\n\n Another option: ""BURNS"": B,U,R,N,S -> positions: 1-B,2-U,3-R,4-N,5-S. \n   But then N is at position 4? But our first guess had N at position 4 and it was marked minus, meaning N cannot be at position 4. So we must avoid? Yes.\n\n Therefore, ""BURNS"" is invalid because it puts N at position 4.\n\n Similarly, ""GRIND"": G,R,I,N,D -> Positions: 1-G,2-R (we know R cannot be at position 2, so no), 3-I,4-N (but we know N cannot be at position 4). So avoid.\n\n How about ""GRUNT"": G,R,U,N,T -> positions: 1-G,2-R (cannot put R at 2 -> not allowed). So skip.\n\n Another: ""DRUNK"": D,R,U,N,K -> but R is at position 2? Avoid.\n\n ""URN"" related words? ""URINE"": U,R,I,N,E -> but E cannot be used because it\'s absent? No, the first feedback said E(x) meaning E is absent. So we cannot use E.\n\n So avoid ""URINE"".\n\n How about ""TRUNK"": T,R,U,N,K -> but R at position 2? Not allowed.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s put R in positions other than 2: either 1,3,4,5.\n\n Similarly, N in positions other than 4: 1,2,3,5.\n\n Consider ""PRUNS"": not common, maybe prune without e? Not valid.\n\n Another: ""ROUNDS"": 6 letters? No.\n\n A better one: ""SYRUP"": only 5 letters? Yes, but doesn\'t have N? Wait, we must include N because we know N is in the word.\n\n We cannot omit N because we must confirm where it is. Similarly for R.\n\n So we must include both R and N.\n\n Let\'s try ""RINDS"": R,I,N,D,S -> positions: 1-R, 2-I, 3-N (so N at position 3? That\'s new), 4-D,5-S. Now, R is at position 1 (not 2) -> okay. N at position 3 (not 4) -> okay. And letters: don\'t use C,A,E -> good.\n\n But we have R at position 1. Is that allowed? Yes, because the only constraint is R not at 2, so it could be at 1.\n\n Also, ""rinds"" is a word (e.g., orange rinds).\n\n Alternatively, ""NURSE"": N,U,R,S,E -> but E is absent (first feedback E marked x) so we cannot use E.\n\n Another: ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N -> positions: 1-M, 2-O, 3-U, 4-R, 5-N -> this is interesting: \n   R is at position 4 (not 2), N at position 5 (not 4) -> okay. \n   Letters: M, O, U, R, N -> no C,A,E -> valid.\n\n Is ""mourn"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n How about ""SPIRN"": not a word. Or ""HORNY"": H,O,R,N,Y -> positions: 1-H,2-O,3-R (R at position 3 -> not 2),4-N (but we cannot put N at position 4) -> skip because N at 4 is disallowed.\n\n Wait, in ""HORNY"", N is at position 4? Which is forbidden.\n\n So avoid.\n\n Now between ""MOURN"" and ""SPURN"", both seem valid? I also thought of ""RINDS"".\n\n Let me check if ""MOURN"" is 5 letters: yes. ""SPURN"": yes. ""RINDS"": yes.\n\n Which one to choose? We want to cover new letters. \n\n First guess letters: C,R,A,N,E -> we have used R and N. \n\n For second guess, we want to cover letters that are not tested: in ""MOURN"": we cover M, O, U, R, N -> R and N are repeated, so new: M, O, U.\n\n In ""SPURN"": S, P, U, R, N -> new: S, P, U.\n\n In ""RINDS"": R, I, N, D, S -> new: I, D, S.\n\n Which letters are more common?\n\n Among consonants: S, T, L, etc., vowels: O, U, I.\n\n Probably ""SPURN"" covers S, P (two consonants) and U (vowel). ""MOURN"" has M which is less common? But U and O are vowels.\n\n Since we haven\'t tested O, I, U, we might want to test one vowel? \n\n Alternatively, to avoid potential duplication of letters? The secret word might not have duplicates, but we don\'t know.\n\n Actually, Wordle can have duplicate letters? However, the feedback might show duplicated feedback? But in Wordle, if a letter appears twice but the secret only has one, then the second one might show as yellow or gray? But we don\'t know yet.\n\n But our first guess had no duplicates, and we got two yellow letters (R and N). So the word has R and N exactly? Or maybe it has duplicates? But we don\'t know.\n\n To be safe, we should choose a word without duplicates if possible.\n\n Also, note that ""SPURN"" has letters S, P, U, R, N: all distinct? Yes.\n\n ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N: distinct.\n\n ""RINDS"": R,I,N,D,S: distinct.\n\n Now, which word gives us more information? Covering more common letters.\n\n I think ""SPURN"" might be better because it includes S which is very common. P is common but less than some others. U is a vowel.\n\n Compare to ""RINDS"": includes I (vowel) and D,S. \n\n Another candidate: ""WORDS"": but has O, and S, but doesn\'t have N? Must have N.\n\n Because we know N is in the word. So words without N are invalid.\n\n We must use both R and N.\n\n I will go with ""SPURN"" as it covers S, P, U (new letters) and R, N (known) in new positions.\n\n So guess: SPURN\n\n Format our response.\n\n First, we do the reasoning above, then output.\n\n We say:\n <thinking>\n We have feedback from CRANE: C absent, R present but not in position 2, A absent, N present but not in position 4, E absent.\n Therefore, next guess must include R and N (placed in positions other than 2 and 4 respectively) and avoid C,A,E.\n We choose ""SPURN"": places R at position 4 (new) and N at position 5 (new). It introduces new letters S, P, U. It avoids the forbidden letters and positions.\n </thinking>\n Then: <guess>SPURN</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (C[x], R[-], A[x], N[-], E[x]), we know:\n- R and N are in the secret word but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.\n- C, A, and E are absent from the word.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include R and N, placed in new positions (avoiding position 2 for R and position 4 for N).\n- Avoid using C, A, E.\n- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.\n\nAfter considering options like ""MOURN"" and ""RINDS"", ""SPURN"" was selected because:\n- Positions: R at position 4 (≠2) and N at position 5 (≠4).\n- Uses new letters: S, P, U (common consonants and a vowel).\n- Valid 5-letter word meaning ""to reject disdainfully"".\n\n<guess>SPURN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPURN -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) U(x) R(-) N(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, A, E are absent from the word.
- R is present but not in position 2.
- N is present but not in position 4.

Guess 2: SPURN -> S(x) P(x) U(x) R(-) N(-)
Meaning:
- S, P, U are absent from the word.
- R is present but not in position 4 (since in SPURN, R is at position 4 and it's marked minus).
- N is present but not in position 5 (since in SPURN, N is at position 5 and it's marked minus).

Now, combining the information:

Absent letters: C, A, E, S, P, U. So we cannot use these.

Present letters: R and N (from both guesses).

We know R is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). So R must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 5.

Similarly, N is not in position 4 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess). So N must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 3.

But note: the word has 5 positions. We have two known letters: R and N, and we need to find the other three.

We also know that the word does not contain: C, A, E, S, P, U.

We need to choose a word that includes R and N, in positions that are allowed, and three new letters that are not in the absent list.

What letters are left? The alphabet minus absent letters: 
Absent: C, A, E, S, P, U. So available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, T, W, Y.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word with R and N, and three from the available letters.

Constraints on positions:
- R can be in positions 1, 3, 5.
- N can be in positions 1, 2, 3.

But note: if we put R and N in the same word, we have to assign positions without conflict.

Also, we must avoid the positions where they were previously misplaced.

Let's list possible positions for R and N:

For R: positions 1, 3, 5
For N: positions 1, 2, 3

But they cannot be in the same position? Actually, they are two different letters, so they can share a position? No, each position has one letter. So if R is at 1, then N cannot be at 1. Similarly, if R is at 3, then N cannot be at 3. And if R is at 5, then N can be at 1,2,3.

So possible combinations:

Case 1: R at 1 -> then N can be at 2 or 3 (since 1 is taken).
Case 2: R at 3 -> then N can be at 1 or 2 (since 3 is taken).
Case 3: R at 5 -> then N can be at 1, 2, or 3.

We need to choose a word that fits one of these and uses available letters.

We also want to cover new common letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that have R and N, and three other available letters.

Common patterns:

- Words ending with R? But R at 5 is possible.

- Words starting with R? Then R at 1.

- Words with R in the middle.

Let me brainstorm:

Option 1: R at position 1, N at position 2: e.g., R N _ _ _
But what letters? We need three letters from available. Example: ROUND? But U is absent. RINSE? But S and E absent. RINSE has S and E which are absent. Not allowed.

Option: R at 1, N at 3: R _ N _ _
Example: ROBIN? But O and B are available? ROBIN: R, O, B, I, N -> but that's 5 letters? R at 1, O at 2, B at 3? No: positions: 1-R, 2-O, 3-B, 4-I, 5-N? But we want N at position 3? Then it would be R _ N _ _ -> so if N is at 3, then positions: 1-R, 2-?, 3-N, 4-?, 5-?.

So for R at 1, N at 3: words like: R A N _ _ -> but A is absent. R E N _ _ -> E absent. R I N _ _ -> like RINSE? But S and E absent. RINKY? Not a word. RINDY? Not common.

Another: R _ N _ _ with available letters: e.g., R O N D O? But O repeated? And D and O available. ""RONDO"" is 5 letters? R at 1, O at 2, N at 3, D at 4, O at 5? But O repeated? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we can try. However, we have to avoid absent letters.

But ""RONDO"" has two O's? And O is available. But let's see: R at 1, O at 2, N at 3, D at 4, O at 5. But we have N at position 3? And R at 1. But in the feedback, we don't have any O or D tested yet. So it might be a candidate.

But is ""RONDO"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a musical form.

But we have two O's? The secret word might not have duplicates? But we don't know. It's acceptable to try.

But we have to consider other options.

Option: R at 1, N at 2: R N _ _ _
Words: RNZAA? Not valid. RNA? Not 5 letters. ROUND? U absent. RINSE? S and E absent. Not many common words.

How about R at 3? Then N at 1 or 2.

Case: R at 3, N at 1: N _ R _ _
Example: N O R M _ -> NORM? 4 letters. NORMAL? 6. N O R D S? But S absent. N O R I K? Not valid.

Case: R at 3, N at 2: _ N R _ _
Example: O N R E P? Not valid. B N R G? Not. Few words.

Case: R at 5, then N at 1,2, or 3.

Subcase: R at 5, N at 1: N _ _ _ R
Example: N _ _ _ R: like ""LONER"" but L, O, N, E, R -> E absent. ""TONER"" -> T, O, N, E, R -> E absent. ""DINER"" -> E absent. ""MINER"" -> E absent. Since E is absent, we cannot use words ending with ER? But we have R at the end.

We need words without E. So N _ _ _ R without E.

Example: ""MANOR"" -> M, A, N, O, R -> but A is absent. ""MINOR"" -> M, I, N, O, R -> but M, I, N, O, R: all available? Let's check: A absent? MINOR has no A, E, S, P, U, C. So M, I, N, O, R are all allowed.

But positions: N at 1? MINOR: M at 1, I at 2, N at 3, O at 4, R at 5. So R is at 5? That's allowed. N is at 3? But we have constraint: N cannot be at position 4 (from first guess) and not at 5 (from second guess), but position 3 is allowed. So N at 3 is okay.

But in MINOR, N is at position 3? Yes. And R at position 5? Yes.

But we also have to check if R and N are in new positions: 
- R: previously at position 2 (in CRANE) and 4 (in SPURN), now at 5: new position, good.
- N: previously at position 4 (in CRANE) and 5 (in SPURN), now at 3: new position, good.

So ""MINOR"" is a candidate.

Subcase: R at 5, N at 2: _ N _ _ R
Example: O N L Y R? Not a word. I N F O R? Not 5. B N T R? Not. ""ONCER""? Not valid. ""INKER""? E absent. ""ANKER""? A absent. Not many.

Subcase: R at 5, N at 3: _ _ N _ R
Example: B O N G R? Not. T O N G R? Not. ""LONER"" but E absent. ""TONER"" E absent. ""HONOR"" -> H, O, N, O, R: positions: 1-H, 2-O, 3-N, 4-O, 5-R. So N at 3? Allowed. R at 5? Allowed. And letters: H, O, N, O, R -> O repeated? But H and O available. ""HONOR"" is a valid word.

But we have two O's? It might be acceptable.

But we already have ""MINOR"" without duplicates? MINOR has no duplicates.

Another candidate: ""MINOR"" and ""HONOR"".

But ""MINOR"" uses M, I, O, N, R.

We also have the case R at 1, N at 3: we had ""RONDO"" as a candidate? But ""RONDO"" has two O's.

Now, to choose between these, we should pick one that covers new letters.

We have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

In ""MINOR"": M, I, O, N, R -> new letters: M, I, O (N and R are known).

In ""HONOR"": H, O, N, O, R -> new: H, O (and O repeated).

In ""RONDO"": R, O, N, D, O -> new: O, D (and O repeated).

We want to maximize new information. ""MINOR"" introduces three new letters: M, I, O. ""HONOR"" introduces two: H, O (and one duplicate). ""RONDO"" introduces two: O, D (and one duplicate). So ""MINOR"" is better.

But we must ensure that the positions are correct: in ""MINOR"", R is at 5 and N is at 3? Let's write it:

M I N O R
Positions: 1-M, 2-I, 3-N, 4-O, 5-R.

Now, constraints:
- R: must not be at 2 or 4 -> 5 is okay.
- N: must not be at 4 or 5 -> 3 is okay.

So it satisfies.

Is there a word with more common letters? We could try to include T or L, which are very common.

For example, R at 5, N at 1: N _ _ _ R without E. We had ""MINOR"" but that has N at 3? Not at 1.

What about N at 1 and R at 5: words like ""N__ _ R"": e.g., ""NADIR"" but A absent. ""NOMBR""? Not valid. ""NIGER""? E absent. ""NYMPH""? M, P? P is absent? P is absent from second guess. So no.

Another: ""NODER""? E absent.

So ""MINOR"" seems a good choice.

But let's check if there is a word with T? For example, ""MINTY""? But T and Y, but then R is missing? We must include R and N.

""MINOR"" has R and N.

Another candidate: ""TRIBE"" but E absent and B? But we need R and N. ""TRIBE"" has R but not N? So no.

""BRING"": B, R, I, N, G -> positions: 1-B, 2-R (but R cannot be at position 2! from first guess). So invalid.

""GRIND"": G, R, I, N, D -> R at position 2? Not allowed.

""DRINK"": D, R, I, N, K -> R at 2? Not allowed.

""PRINT"": P is absent.

So ""MINOR"" seems solid.

We could also consider ""ROBIN"", but in ""ROBIN"": R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, I at 4, N at 5. But N at 5? We know from second guess that N cannot be at position 5 (because in SPURN, N at 5 was minus). So N at 5 is disallowed. Therefore, ""ROBIN"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""ORBIN""? Not a word.

Another: ""RHINO"": R, H, I, N, O -> positions: 1-R, 2-H, 3-I, 4-N, 5-O. But N at position 4? We know from first guess that N cannot be at position 4 (CRANE had N at 4 and minus). So invalid.

Therefore, ""MINOR"" is a good candidate.

So I will go with ""MINOR"".

But let's confirm the letters: M, I, N, O, R. 
- M: not tested before -> new.
- I: not tested -> new.
- O: not tested -> new.
- N: known present.
- R: known present.

And positions: R at 5 (allowed), N at 3 (allowed).

So we can use this.

Therefore, the next guess is ""MINOR"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, A, E absent; R and N present but not in positions 2 and 4.
- **Guess 2 (SPURN)**: S, P, U absent; R and N present but not in positions 4 and 5.

### Key Insights:
- **Absent letters**: C, A, E, S, P, U (cannot be used).
- **Present letters**: R and N must be included.
- **Position constraints**:
  - R cannot be in position 2 (from CRANE) or 4 (from SPURN), so R must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
  - N cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE) or 5 (from SPURN), so N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (focus on common letters like M, I, O, T, L).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Must include R and N in valid positions (avoiding disallowed slots).
- Use new, common letters to maximize information (e.g., M, I, O).
- Avoid repeating positions for R and N from previous guesses.
- ""MINOR"" was chosen because:
  - Positions: R at 5 (allowed, not 2 or 4), N at 3 (allowed, not 4 or 5).
  - Letters: M, I, O are new and common; N and R are confirmed present.
  - Valid 5-letter word meaning ""lesser in importance"".
  - Tests three new letters (M, I, O) while respecting constraints.

<guess>MINOR</guess>",MINOR,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, A, E are absent from the word.
- R is present but not in position 2.
- N is present but not in position 4.

Guess 2: SPURN -> S(x) P(x) U(x) R(-) N(-)
Meaning:
- S, P, U are absent from the word.
- R is present but not in position 4 (since in SPURN, R is at position 4 and it's marked minus).
- N is present but not in position 5 (since in SPURN, N is at position 5 and it's marked minus).

Now, combining the information:

Absent letters: C, A, E, S, P, U. So we cannot use these.

Present letters: R and N (from both guesses).

We know R is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). So R must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 5.

Similarly, N is not in position 4 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess). So N must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 3.

But note: the word has 5 positions. We have two known letters: R and N, and we need to find the other three.

We also know that the word does not contain: C, A, E, S, P, U.

We need to choose a word that includes R and N, in positions that are allowed, and three new letters that are not in the absent list.

What letters are left? The alphabet minus absent letters: 
Absent: C, A, E, S, P, U. So available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, T, W, Y.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word with R and N, and three from the available letters.

Constraints on positions:
- R can be in positions 1, 3, 5.
- N can be in positions 1, 2, 3.

But note: if we put R and N in the same word, we have to assign positions without conflict.

Also, we must avoid the positions where they were previously misplaced.

Let's list possible positions for R and N:

For R: positions 1, 3, 5
For N: positions 1, 2, 3

But they cannot be in the same position? Actually, they are two different letters, so they can share a position? No, each position has one letter. So if R is at 1, then N cannot be at 1. Similarly, if R is at 3, then N cannot be at 3. And if R is at 5, then N can be at 1,2,3.

So possible combinations:

Case 1: R at 1 -> then N can be at 2 or 3 (since 1 is taken).
Case 2: R at 3 -> then N can be at 1 or 2 (since 3 is taken).
Case 3: R at 5 -> then N can be at 1, 2, or 3.

We need to choose a word that fits one of these and uses available letters.

We also want to cover new common letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that have R and N, and three other available letters.

Common patterns:

- Words ending with R? But R at 5 is possible.

- Words starting with R? Then R at 1.

- Words with R in the middle.

Let me brainstorm:

Option 1: R at position 1, N at position 2: e.g., R N _ _ _
But what letters? We need three letters from available. Example: ROUND? But U is absent. RINSE? But S and E absent. RINSE has S and E which are absent. Not allowed.

Option: R at 1, N at 3: R _ N _ _
Example: ROBIN? But O and B are available? ROBIN: R, O, B, I, N -> but that's 5 letters? R at 1, O at 2, B at 3? No: positions: 1-R, 2-O, 3-B, 4-I, 5-N? But we want N at position 3? Then it would be R _ N _ _ -> so if N is at 3, then positions: 1-R, 2-?, 3-N, 4-?, 5-?.

So for R at 1, N at 3: words like: R A N _ _ -> but A is absent. R E N _ _ -> E absent. R I N _ _ -> like RINSE? But S and E absent. RINKY? Not a word. RINDY? Not common.

Another: R _ N _ _ with available letters: e.g., R O N D O? But O repeated? And D and O available. ""RONDO"" is 5 letters? R at 1, O at 2, N at 3, D at 4, O at 5? But O repeated? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we can try. However, we have to avoid absent letters.

But ""RONDO"" has two O's? And O is available. But let's see: R at 1, O at 2, N at 3, D at 4, O at 5. But we have N at position 3? And R at 1. But in the feedback, we don't have any O or D tested yet. So it might be a candidate.

But is ""RONDO"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a musical form.

But we have two O's? The secret word might not have duplicates? But we don't know. It's acceptable to try.

But we have to consider other options.

Option: R at 1, N at 2: R N _ _ _
Words: RNZAA? Not valid. RNA? Not 5 letters. ROUND? U absent. RINSE? S and E absent. Not many common words.

How about R at 3? Then N at 1 or 2.

Case: R at 3, N at 1: N _ R _ _
Example: N O R M _ -> NORM? 4 letters. NORMAL? 6. N O R D S? But S absent. N O R I K? Not valid.

Case: R at 3, N at 2: _ N R _ _
Example: O N R E P? Not valid. B N R G? Not. Few words.

Case: R at 5, then N at 1,2, or 3.

Subcase: R at 5, N at 1: N _ _ _ R
Example: N _ _ _ R: like ""LONER"" but L, O, N, E, R -> E absent. ""TONER"" -> T, O, N, E, R -> E absent. ""DINER"" -> E absent. ""MINER"" -> E absent. Since E is absent, we cannot use words ending with ER? But we have R at the end.

We need words without E. So N _ _ _ R without E.

Example: ""MANOR"" -> M, A, N, O, R -> but A is absent. ""MINOR"" -> M, I, N, O, R -> but M, I, N, O, R: all available? Let's check: A absent? MINOR has no A, E, S, P, U, C. So M, I, N, O, R are all allowed.

But positions: N at 1? MINOR: M at 1, I at 2, N at 3, O at 4, R at 5. So R is at 5? That's allowed. N is at 3? But we have constraint: N cannot be at position 4 (from first guess) and not at 5 (from second guess), but position 3 is allowed. So N at 3 is okay.

But in MINOR, N is at position 3? Yes. And R at position 5? Yes.

But we also have to check if R and N are in new positions: 
- R: previously at position 2 (in CRANE) and 4 (in SPURN), now at 5: new position, good.
- N: previously at position 4 (in CRANE) and 5 (in SPURN), now at 3: new position, good.

So ""MINOR"" is a candidate.

Subcase: R at 5, N at 2: _ N _ _ R
Example: O N L Y R? Not a word. I N F O R? Not 5. B N T R? Not. ""ONCER""? Not valid. ""INKER""? E absent. ""ANKER""? A absent. Not many.

Subcase: R at 5, N at 3: _ _ N _ R
Example: B O N G R? Not. T O N G R? Not. ""LONER"" but E absent. ""TONER"" E absent. ""HONOR"" -> H, O, N, O, R: positions: 1-H, 2-O, 3-N, 4-O, 5-R. So N at 3? Allowed. R at 5? Allowed. And letters: H, O, N, O, R -> O repeated? But H and O available. ""HONOR"" is a valid word.

But we have two O's? It might be acceptable.

But we already have ""MINOR"" without duplicates? MINOR has no duplicates.

Another candidate: ""MINOR"" and ""HONOR"".

But ""MINOR"" uses M, I, O, N, R.

We also have the case R at 1, N at 3: we had ""RONDO"" as a candidate? But ""RONDO"" has two O's.

Now, to choose between these, we should pick one that covers new letters.

We have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

In ""MINOR"": M, I, O, N, R -> new letters: M, I, O (N and R are known).

In ""HONOR"": H, O, N, O, R -> new: H, O (and O repeated).

In ""RONDO"": R, O, N, D, O -> new: O, D (and O repeated).

We want to maximize new information. ""MINOR"" introduces three new letters: M, I, O. ""HONOR"" introduces two: H, O (and one duplicate). ""RONDO"" introduces two: O, D (and one duplicate). So ""MINOR"" is better.

But we must ensure that the positions are correct: in ""MINOR"", R is at 5 and N is at 3? Let's write it:

M I N O R
Positions: 1-M, 2-I, 3-N, 4-O, 5-R.

Now, constraints:
- R: must not be at 2 or 4 -> 5 is okay.
- N: must not be at 4 or 5 -> 3 is okay.

So it satisfies.

Is there a word with more common letters? We could try to include T or L, which are very common.

For example, R at 5, N at 1: N _ _ _ R without E. We had ""MINOR"" but that has N at 3? Not at 1.

What about N at 1 and R at 5: words like ""N__ _ R"": e.g., ""NADIR"" but A absent. ""NOMBR""? Not valid. ""NIGER""? E absent. ""NYMPH""? M, P? P is absent? P is absent from second guess. So no.

Another: ""NODER""? E absent.

So ""MINOR"" seems a good choice.

But let's check if there is a word with T? For example, ""MINTY""? But T and Y, but then R is missing? We must include R and N.

""MINOR"" has R and N.

Another candidate: ""TRIBE"" but E absent and B? But we need R and N. ""TRIBE"" has R but not N? So no.

""BRING"": B, R, I, N, G -> positions: 1-B, 2-R (but R cannot be at position 2! from first guess). So invalid.

""GRIND"": G, R, I, N, D -> R at position 2? Not allowed.

""DRINK"": D, R, I, N, K -> R at 2? Not allowed.

""PRINT"": P is absent.

So ""MINOR"" seems solid.

We could also consider ""ROBIN"", but in ""ROBIN"": R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, I at 4, N at 5. But N at 5? We know from second guess that N cannot be at position 5 (because in SPURN, N at 5 was minus). So N at 5 is disallowed. Therefore, ""ROBIN"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""ORBIN""? Not a word.

Another: ""RHINO"": R, H, I, N, O -> positions: 1-R, 2-H, 3-I, 4-N, 5-O. But N at position 4? We know from first guess that N cannot be at position 4 (CRANE had N at 4 and minus). So invalid.

Therefore, ""MINOR"" is a good candidate.

So I will go with ""MINOR"".

But let's confirm the letters: M, I, N, O, R. 
- M: not tested before -> new.
- I: not tested -> new.
- O: not tested -> new.
- N: known present.
- R: known present.

And positions: R at 5 (allowed), N at 3 (allowed).

So we can use this.

Therefore, the next guess is ""MINOR"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, A, E absent; R and N present but not in positions 2 and 4.
- **Guess 2 (SPURN)**: S, P, U absent; R and N present but not in positions 4 and 5.

### Key Insights:
- **Absent letters**: C, A, E, S, P, U (cannot be used).
- **Present letters**: R and N must be included.
- **Position constraints**:
  - R cannot be in position 2 (from CRANE) or 4 (from SPURN), so R must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
  - N cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE) or 5 (from SPURN), so N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (focus on common letters like M, I, O, T, L).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Must include R and N in valid positions (avoiding disallowed slots).
- Use new, common letters to maximize information (e.g., M, I, O).
- Avoid repeating positions for R and N from previous guesses.
- ""MINOR"" was chosen because:
  - Positions: R at 5 (allowed, not 2 or 4), N at 3 (allowed, not 4 or 5).
  - Letters: M, I, O are new and common; N and R are confirmed present.
  - Valid 5-letter word meaning ""lesser in importance"".
  - Tests three new letters (M, I, O) while respecting constraints.",Guess 3: MINOR -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to make the first guess for a Wordle game. Since I don't have any information yet, I should start with a word that has common letters to maximize the feedback I get.

Common vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U. Common consonants include R, S, T, L, N, etc. A good starter word often uses several of these to cover more possibilities.

Popular first guesses in Wordle are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", or ""ADIEU"". These use a mix of vowels and common consonants.

I should choose a word that has no repeating letters since that could waste a guess if letters are unique.

Let me list out some options:

- ""CRANE"": C, R, A, N, E – has A and E vowels, R and N common consonants.

- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – similar, with S,T,L.

- ""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T – has O instead of E.

""ADIEU"" has A,I,E,U which are vowels, but it misses some consonants, so it might not be as balanced.

Another good one is ""RADIO"" or ""MEDIA"".

I think ""CRANE"" is often recommended because it covers C,R,A,N,E – all common letters.

Alternatives: ""SALET"" is a word, but less common.

Since I need a valid English word, I'll stick with common ones.

Let me go with ""CRANE"". It's a solid choice for a first guess.

So, my guess will be ""CRANE"".

Now, for the response format, I need to output my thought process within <think> <thinking>tags, and then the guess in

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(x)
 So, the secret word has the letter R and N somewhere, but not in those positions (since they are marked minus), and does not have C, A, or E.

 Specifically:
   - C is not in the secret word (marked x)
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (since our guess was C-R-A-N-E, and positions are 1-based? or 0-based? Actually, in the feedback, we say position of R is 2? Let's index from 1: position 1=C, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=E).

 But note: the secret word has R, but not at position 2, and has N, but not at position 4. Also, the letters C, A, and E are absent.

 Now, we know that R and N are in the word, so we must include them in our next guess. And avoid C, A, E.

 Also, we have 5 positions to guess. We need to choose a word with R and N, but not C, A, E.

 Additionally, R cannot be in position 2 and N cannot be in position 4.

 Let's think of words that include R and N, and try to cover new common letters.

 What are other common letters? We can try to use vowels that haven't been checked. We didn't check O, U, I, etc. And consonants like T, L, S, D, etc.

 Our new guess should have R and N, put them in different positions than before (so R not at spot 2, N not at spot 4), and include three new letters that are possible.

 We also want to avoid A and E (since absent) and C (absent).

 Possible candidate: ""R"" must be somewhere else, say positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: if we put R at position 1, that might be a possibility. Similarly for N, we can put it at positions 1,2,3,5? (but in guess we can try any position).

 However, we must use valid English words.

 Let me brainstorm words with R and N, and excluding A, E, C.

 Examples:
   - ""HORNS"": H, O, R, N, S -> but we have O which is a new vowel, and S common.
   - ""BORNS"": not valid word? Actually, borns is not common, but ""barns"" has A which is excluded.
   - ""PORNS"": that might be sensitive and probably not suitable? Avoid.
   - ""WORNS"": not valid? Perhaps ""worn"" is base, but we need 5 letters.

   - Another: ""DARN"" but that's 4 letters. We need 5.

   - ""TORN"": only 4 letters.

   - ""RUNTY"": but has Y and T, and 5 letters? Actually, ""runty"" is an adjective meaning small and weak, valid.

   However, we don't have many letters covered. Let's try to include another vowel?

   Since A and E are out, we can try I, O, U.

 Let me think: ""PRINT"": P, R, I, N, T -> has R and N? R at position 2? But in our first guess R was at pos2 and it was minus meaning not there. So in ""PRINT"", R is at pos2? We cannot put R at position 2. So ""PRINT"" would put R again at the same position which is bad because we know R is not at position 2.

 We must avoid putting R at position 2.

 Similarly, avoid N at position 4.

 So ""PRINT"" is not good then? But if we change the position: let's see if we can move R elsewhere.

 Alternatively, ""ROUND"": R, O, U, N, D -> R is at position 1? Then N is at position 4? But we cannot put N at position 4 because that was the position where we had N and it was minus, meaning N is in the word but not at position 4.

 So if we put N at position 4 in this guess, it would be invalid because we know it's not there. Therefore, we must avoid that.

 Therefore, in ""ROUND"": 
   position 1: R -> R cannot be at position 1? No, we don't know about position 1 yet. Only that R cannot be at position 2 (from previous guess). So putting R at 1 is okay? But wait: when we had CRANE, R was at position 2 and got minus. So R must be at a position other than 2. Similarly, N must be at a position other than 4.

 ""ROUND"" has R at position 1 (which is new) and N at position 4? Not allowed because from the first guess, N was at position 4 and marked minus meaning it cannot be at position 4. So ""ROUND"" would have N at position 4 again? That would be bad.

 Therefore, skip ""ROUND"".

 What about ""SPURN"": S, P, U, R, N -> positions: 1-S,2-P,3-U,4-R,5-N? 
   Then R is at position 4 -> which is different than position 2? Yes. And N is at position 5 -> different from position 4? Yes. 
   So this would be acceptable.

 Is ""spurn"" a word? Yes: verb meaning to reject with disdain.

 Also, we introduce new letters: S, P, U, and we already know R and N.

 But note: we excluded C, A, E. S and P are common consonants, U is a vowel.

 So let's consider:

   Previous absent letters: C, A, E -> so S, P, U are not C,A,E -> acceptable.

   Now, we are also avoiding putting R at the wrong position? Yes: we have R at position 4 which is new.

   And N at position 5 (new).

 So ""SPURN"" seems good.

 Another option: ""BURNS"": B,U,R,N,S -> positions: 1-B,2-U,3-R,4-N,5-S. 
   But then N is at position 4? But our first guess had N at position 4 and it was marked minus, meaning N cannot be at position 4. So we must avoid? Yes.

 Therefore, ""BURNS"" is invalid because it puts N at position 4.

 Similarly, ""GRIND"": G,R,I,N,D -> Positions: 1-G,2-R (we know R cannot be at position 2, so no), 3-I,4-N (but we know N cannot be at position 4). So avoid.

 How about ""GRUNT"": G,R,U,N,T -> positions: 1-G,2-R (cannot put R at 2 -> not allowed). So skip.

 Another: ""DRUNK"": D,R,U,N,K -> but R is at position 2? Avoid.

 ""URN"" related words? ""URINE"": U,R,I,N,E -> but E cannot be used because it's absent? No, the first feedback said E(x) meaning E is absent. So we cannot use E.

 So avoid ""URINE"".

 How about ""TRUNK"": T,R,U,N,K -> but R at position 2? Not allowed.

 Alternatively, let's put R in positions other than 2: either 1,3,4,5.

 Similarly, N in positions other than 4: 1,2,3,5.

 Consider ""PRUNS"": not common, maybe prune without e? Not valid.

 Another: ""ROUNDS"": 6 letters? No.

 A better one: ""SYRUP"": only 5 letters? Yes, but doesn't have N? Wait, we must include N because we know N is in the word.

 We cannot omit N because we must confirm where it is. Similarly for R.

 So we must include both R and N.

 Let's try ""RINDS"": R,I,N,D,S -> positions: 1-R, 2-I, 3-N (so N at position 3? That's new), 4-D,5-S. Now, R is at position 1 (not 2) -> okay. N at position 3 (not 4) -> okay. And letters: don't use C,A,E -> good.

 But we have R at position 1. Is that allowed? Yes, because the only constraint is R not at 2, so it could be at 1.

 Also, ""rinds"" is a word (e.g., orange rinds).

 Alternatively, ""NURSE"": N,U,R,S,E -> but E is absent (first feedback E marked x) so we cannot use E.

 Another: ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N -> positions: 1-M, 2-O, 3-U, 4-R, 5-N -> this is interesting: 
   R is at position 4 (not 2), N at position 5 (not 4) -> okay. 
   Letters: M, O, U, R, N -> no C,A,E -> valid.

 Is ""mourn"" a valid word? Yes.

 How about ""SPIRN"": not a word. Or ""HORNY"": H,O,R,N,Y -> positions: 1-H,2-O,3-R (R at position 3 -> not 2),4-N (but we cannot put N at position 4) -> skip because N at 4 is disallowed.

 Wait, in ""HORNY"", N is at position 4? Which is forbidden.

 So avoid.

 Now between ""MOURN"" and ""SPURN"", both seem valid? I also thought of ""RINDS"".

 Let me check if ""MOURN"" is 5 letters: yes. ""SPURN"": yes. ""RINDS"": yes.

 Which one to choose? We want to cover new letters. 

 First guess letters: C,R,A,N,E -> we have used R and N. 

 For second guess, we want to cover letters that are not tested: in ""MOURN"": we cover M, O, U, R, N -> R and N are repeated, so new: M, O, U.

 In ""SPURN"": S, P, U, R, N -> new: S, P, U.

 In ""RINDS"": R, I, N, D, S -> new: I, D, S.

 Which letters are more common?

 Among consonants: S, T, L, etc., vowels: O, U, I.

 Probably ""SPURN"" covers S, P (two consonants) and U (vowel). ""MOURN"" has M which is less common? But U and O are vowels.

 Since we haven't tested O, I, U, we might want to test one vowel? 

 Alternatively, to avoid potential duplication of letters? The secret word might not have duplicates, but we don't know.

 Actually, Wordle can have duplicate letters? However, the feedback might show duplicated feedback? But in Wordle, if a letter appears twice but the secret only has one, then the second one might show as yellow or gray? But we don't know yet.

 But our first guess had no duplicates, and we got two yellow letters (R and N). So the word has R and N exactly? Or maybe it has duplicates? But we don't know.

 To be safe, we should choose a word without duplicates if possible.

 Also, note that ""SPURN"" has letters S, P, U, R, N: all distinct? Yes.

 ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N: distinct.

 ""RINDS"": R,I,N,D,S: distinct.

 Now, which word gives us more information? Covering more common letters.

 I think ""SPURN"" might be better because it includes S which is very common. P is common but less than some others. U is a vowel.

 Compare to ""RINDS"": includes I (vowel) and D,S. 

 Another candidate: ""WORDS"": but has O, and S, but doesn't have N? Must have N.

 Because we know N is in the word. So words without N are invalid.

 We must use both R and N.

 I will go with ""SPURN"" as it covers S, P, U (new letters) and R, N (known) in new positions.

 So guess: SPURN

 Format our response.

 First, we do the reasoning above, then output.

 We say:
 <thinking>
 We have feedback from CRANE: C absent, R present but not in position 2, A absent, N present but not in position 4, E absent.
 Therefore, next guess must include R and N (placed in positions other than 2 and 4 respectively) and avoid C,A,E.
 We choose ""SPURN"": places R at position 4 (new) and N at position 5 (new). It introduces new letters S, P, U. It avoids the forbidden letters and positions.
 </thinking>
 Then: <guess>SPURN</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (C[x], R[-], A[x], N[-], E[x]), we know:
- R and N are in the secret word but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
- C, A, and E are absent from the word.

For the next guess:
- Must include R and N, placed in new positions (avoiding position 2 for R and position 4 for N).
- Avoid using C, A, E.
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.

After considering options like ""MOURN"" and ""RINDS"", ""SPURN"" was selected because:
- Positions: R at position 4 (≠2) and N at position 5 (≠4).
- Uses new letters: S, P, U (common consonants and a vowel).
- Valid 5-letter word meaning ""to reject disdainfully"".

<guess>SPURN</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPURN -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) U(x) R(-) N(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, A, E are absent from the word.
- R is present but not in position 2.
- N is present but not in position 4.

Guess 2: SPURN -> S(x) P(x) U(x) R(-) N(-)
Meaning:
- S, P, U are absent from the word.
- R is present but not in position 4 (since in SPURN, R is at position 4 and it's marked minus).
- N is present but not in position 5 (since in SPURN, N is at position 5 and it's marked minus).

Now, combining the information:

Absent letters: C, A, E, S, P, U. So we cannot use these.

Present letters: R and N (from both guesses).

We know R is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). So R must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 5.

Similarly, N is not in position 4 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess). So N must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 3.

But note: the word has 5 positions. We have two known letters: R and N, and we need to find the other three.

We also know that the word does not contain: C, A, E, S, P, U.

We need to choose a word that includes R and N, in positions that are allowed, and three new letters that are not in the absent list.

What letters are left? The alphabet minus absent letters: 
Absent: C, A, E, S, P, U. So available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, T, W, Y.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word with R and N, and three from the available letters.

Constraints on positions:
- R can be in positions 1, 3, 5.
- N can be in positions 1, 2, 3.

But note: if we put R and N in the same word, we have to assign positions without conflict.

Also, we must avoid the positions where they were previously misplaced.

Let's list possible positions for R and N:

For R: positions 1, 3, 5
For N: positions 1, 2, 3

But they cannot be in the same position? Actually, they are two different letters, so they can share a position? No, each position has one letter. So if R is at 1, then N cannot be at 1. Similarly, if R is at 3, then N cannot be at 3. And if R is at 5, then N can be at 1,2,3.

So possible combinations:

Case 1: R at 1 -> then N can be at 2 or 3 (since 1 is taken).
Case 2: R at 3 -> then N can be at 1 or 2 (since 3 is taken).
Case 3: R at 5 -> then N can be at 1, 2, or 3.

We need to choose a word that fits one of these and uses available letters.

We also want to cover new common letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that have R and N, and three other available letters.

Common patterns:

- Words ending with R? But R at 5 is possible.

- Words starting with R? Then R at 1.

- Words with R in the middle.

Let me brainstorm:

Option 1: R at position 1, N at position 2: e.g., R N _ _ _
But what letters? We need three letters from available. Example: ROUND? But U is absent. RINSE? But S and E absent. RINSE has S and E which are absent. Not allowed.

Option: R at 1, N at 3: R _ N _ _
Example: ROBIN? But O and B are available? ROBIN: R, O, B, I, N -> but that's 5 letters? R at 1, O at 2, B at 3? No: positions: 1-R, 2-O, 3-B, 4-I, 5-N? But we want N at position 3? Then it would be R _ N _ _ -> so if N is at 3, then positions: 1-R, 2-?, 3-N, 4-?, 5-?.

So for R at 1, N at 3: words like: R A N _ _ -> but A is absent. R E N _ _ -> E absent. R I N _ _ -> like RINSE? But S and E absent. RINKY? Not a word. RINDY? Not common.

Another: R _ N _ _ with available letters: e.g., R O N D O? But O repeated? And D and O available. ""RONDO"" is 5 letters? R at 1, O at 2, N at 3, D at 4, O at 5? But O repeated? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we can try. However, we have to avoid absent letters.

But ""RONDO"" has two O's? And O is available. But let's see: R at 1, O at 2, N at 3, D at 4, O at 5. But we have N at position 3? And R at 1. But in the feedback, we don't have any O or D tested yet. So it might be a candidate.

But is ""RONDO"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a musical form.

But we have two O's? The secret word might not have duplicates? But we don't know. It's acceptable to try.

But we have to consider other options.

Option: R at 1, N at 2: R N _ _ _
Words: RNZAA? Not valid. RNA? Not 5 letters. ROUND? U absent. RINSE? S and E absent. Not many common words.

How about R at 3? Then N at 1 or 2.

Case: R at 3, N at 1: N _ R _ _
Example: N O R M _ -> NORM? 4 letters. NORMAL? 6. N O R D S? But S absent. N O R I K? Not valid.

Case: R at 3, N at 2: _ N R _ _
Example: O N R E P? Not valid. B N R G? Not. Few words.

Case: R at 5, then N at 1,2, or 3.

Subcase: R at 5, N at 1: N _ _ _ R
Example: N _ _ _ R: like ""LONER"" but L, O, N, E, R -> E absent. ""TONER"" -> T, O, N, E, R -> E absent. ""DINER"" -> E absent. ""MINER"" -> E absent. Since E is absent, we cannot use words ending with ER? But we have R at the end.

We need words without E. So N _ _ _ R without E.

Example: ""MANOR"" -> M, A, N, O, R -> but A is absent. ""MINOR"" -> M, I, N, O, R -> but M, I, N, O, R: all available? Let's check: A absent? MINOR has no A, E, S, P, U, C. So M, I, N, O, R are all allowed.

But positions: N at 1? MINOR: M at 1, I at 2, N at 3, O at 4, R at 5. So R is at 5? That's allowed. N is at 3? But we have constraint: N cannot be at position 4 (from first guess) and not at 5 (from second guess), but position 3 is allowed. So N at 3 is okay.

But in MINOR, N is at position 3? Yes. And R at position 5? Yes.

But we also have to check if R and N are in new positions: 
- R: previously at position 2 (in CRANE) and 4 (in SPURN), now at 5: new position, good.
- N: previously at position 4 (in CRANE) and 5 (in SPURN), now at 3: new position, good.

So ""MINOR"" is a candidate.

Subcase: R at 5, N at 2: _ N _ _ R
Example: O N L Y R? Not a word. I N F O R? Not 5. B N T R? Not. ""ONCER""? Not valid. ""INKER""? E absent. ""ANKER""? A absent. Not many.

Subcase: R at 5, N at 3: _ _ N _ R
Example: B O N G R? Not. T O N G R? Not. ""LONER"" but E absent. ""TONER"" E absent. ""HONOR"" -> H, O, N, O, R: positions: 1-H, 2-O, 3-N, 4-O, 5-R. So N at 3? Allowed. R at 5? Allowed. And letters: H, O, N, O, R -> O repeated? But H and O available. ""HONOR"" is a valid word.

But we have two O's? It might be acceptable.

But we already have ""MINOR"" without duplicates? MINOR has no duplicates.

Another candidate: ""MINOR"" and ""HONOR"".

But ""MINOR"" uses M, I, O, N, R.

We also have the case R at 1, N at 3: we had ""RONDO"" as a candidate? But ""RONDO"" has two O's.

Now, to choose between these, we should pick one that covers new letters.

We have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

In ""MINOR"": M, I, O, N, R -> new letters: M, I, O (N and R are known).

In ""HONOR"": H, O, N, O, R -> new: H, O (and O repeated).

In ""RONDO"": R, O, N, D, O -> new: O, D (and O repeated).

We want to maximize new information. ""MINOR"" introduces three new letters: M, I, O. ""HONOR"" introduces two: H, O (and one duplicate). ""RONDO"" introduces two: O, D (and one duplicate). So ""MINOR"" is better.

But we must ensure that the positions are correct: in ""MINOR"", R is at 5 and N is at 3? Let's write it:

M I N O R
Positions: 1-M, 2-I, 3-N, 4-O, 5-R.

Now, constraints:
- R: must not be at 2 or 4 -> 5 is okay.
- N: must not be at 4 or 5 -> 3 is okay.

So it satisfies.

Is there a word with more common letters? We could try to include T or L, which are very common.

For example, R at 5, N at 1: N _ _ _ R without E. We had ""MINOR"" but that has N at 3? Not at 1.

What about N at 1 and R at 5: words like ""N__ _ R"": e.g., ""NADIR"" but A absent. ""NOMBR""? Not valid. ""NIGER""? E absent. ""NYMPH""? M, P? P is absent? P is absent from second guess. So no.

Another: ""NODER""? E absent.

So ""MINOR"" seems a good choice.

But let's check if there is a word with T? For example, ""MINTY""? But T and Y, but then R is missing? We must include R and N.

""MINOR"" has R and N.

Another candidate: ""TRIBE"" but E absent and B? But we need R and N. ""TRIBE"" has R but not N? So no.

""BRING"": B, R, I, N, G -> positions: 1-B, 2-R (but R cannot be at position 2! from first guess). So invalid.

""GRIND"": G, R, I, N, D -> R at position 2? Not allowed.

""DRINK"": D, R, I, N, K -> R at 2? Not allowed.

""PRINT"": P is absent.

So ""MINOR"" seems solid.

We could also consider ""ROBIN"", but in ""ROBIN"": R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, I at 4, N at 5. But N at 5? We know from second guess that N cannot be at position 5 (because in SPURN, N at 5 was minus). So N at 5 is disallowed. Therefore, ""ROBIN"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""ORBIN""? Not a word.

Another: ""RHINO"": R, H, I, N, O -> positions: 1-R, 2-H, 3-I, 4-N, 5-O. But N at position 4? We know from first guess that N cannot be at position 4 (CRANE had N at 4 and minus). So invalid.

Therefore, ""MINOR"" is a good candidate.

So I will go with ""MINOR"".

But let's confirm the letters: M, I, N, O, R. 
- M: not tested before -> new.
- I: not tested -> new.
- O: not tested -> new.
- N: known present.
- R: known present.

And positions: R at 5 (allowed), N at 3 (allowed).

So we can use this.

Therefore, the next guess is ""MINOR"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, A, E absent; R and N present but not in positions 2 and 4.
- **Guess 2 (SPURN)**: S, P, U absent; R and N present but not in positions 4 and 5.

### Key Insights:
- **Absent letters**: C, A, E, S, P, U (cannot be used).
- **Present letters**: R and N must be included.
- **Position constraints**:
  - R cannot be in position 2 (from CRANE) or 4 (from SPURN), so R must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
  - N cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE) or 5 (from SPURN), so N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (focus on common letters like M, I, O, T, L).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Must include R and N in valid positions (avoiding disallowed slots).
- Use new, common letters to maximize information (e.g., M, I, O).
- Avoid repeating positions for R and N from previous guesses.
- ""MINOR"" was chosen because:
  - Positions: R at 5 (allowed, not 2 or 4), N at 3 (allowed, not 4 or 5).
  - Letters: M, I, O are new and common; N and R are confirmed present.
  - Valid 5-letter word meaning ""lesser in importance"".
  - Tests three new letters (M, I, O) while respecting constraints.

Since I don\'t have any information yet, I should start with a word that has common letters to maximize the feedback I get.\n\nCommon vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U.

Actually, in the feedback, we say position of R is 2? Let\'s index from 1: position 1=C, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=E).\n\n But note: the secret word has R, but not at position 2, and has N, but not at position 4. Also, the letters C, A, and E are absent.\n\n Now, we know that R and N are in the word, so we must include them in our next guess. And avoid C, A, E.\n\n Also, we have 5 positions to guess. We need to choose a word with R and N, but not C, A, E.\n\n Additionally, R cannot be in position 2 and N cannot be in position 4.\n\n Let\'s think of words that include R and N, and try to cover new common letters.\n\n What are other common letters? We can try to use vowels that haven\'t been checked. We didn\'t check O, U, I, etc. And consonants like T, L, S, D, etc.\n\n Our new guess should have R and N, put them in different positions than before (so R not at spot 2, N not at spot 4), and include three new letters that are possible.\n\n We also want to avoid A and E (since absent) and C (absent).\n\n Possible candidate: ""R"" must be somewhere else, say positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: if we put R at position 1, that might be a possibility. Similarly for N, we can put it at positions 1,2,3,5? (but in guess we can try any position).\n\n However, we must use valid English words.\n\n Let me brainstorm words with R and N, and excluding A, E, C.\n\n Examples:\n   - ""HORNS"": H, O, R, N, S -> but we have O which is a new vowel, and S common.\n   - ""BORNS"": not valid word? Actually, borns is not common, but ""barns"" has A which is excluded.\n   - ""PORNS"": that might be sensitive and probably not suitable? Avoid.\n   - ""WORNS"": not valid? Perhaps ""worn"" is base, but we need 5 letters.\n\n   - Another: ""DARN"" but that\'s 4 letters. We need 5.\n\n   - ""TORN"": only 4 letters.\n\n   - ""RUNTY"": but has Y and T, and 5 letters? Actually, ""runty"" is an adjective meaning small and weak, valid.\n\n   However, we don\'t have many letters covered. Let\'s try to include another vowel?\n\n   Since A and E are out, we can try I, O, U.\n\n Let me think: ""PRINT"": P, R, I, N, T -> has R and N? R at position 2? But in our first guess R was at pos2 and it was minus meaning not there. So in ""PRINT"", R is at pos2? We cannot put R at position 2. So ""PRINT"" would put R again at the same position which is bad because we know R is not at position 2.\n\n We must avoid putting R at position 2.\n\n Similarly, avoid N at position 4.\n\n So ""PRINT"" is not good then? But if we change the position: let\'s see if we can move R elsewhere.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROUND"": R, O, U, N, D -> R is at position 1? Then N is at position 4? But we cannot put N at position 4 because that was the position where we had N and it was minus, meaning N is in the word but not at position 4.\n\n So if we put N at position 4 in this guess, it would be invalid because we know it\'s not there. Therefore, we must avoid that.\n\n Therefore, in ""ROUND"": \n   position 1: R -> R cannot be at position 1? No, we don\'t know about position 1 yet. Only that R cannot be at position 2 (from previous guess). So putting R at 1 is okay? But wait: when we had CRANE, R was at position 2 and got minus. So R must be at a position other than 2. Similarly, N must be at a position other than 4.\n\n ""ROUND"" has R at position 1 (which is new) and N at position 4? Not allowed because from the first guess, N was at position 4 and marked minus meaning it cannot be at position 4. So ""ROUND"" would have N at position 4 again? That would be bad.\n\n Therefore, skip ""ROUND"".\n\n What about ""SPURN"": S, P, U, R, N -> positions: 1-S,2-P,3-U,4-R,5-N? \n   Then R is at position 4 -> which is different than position 2? Yes. And N is at position 5 -> different from position 4? Yes. \n   So this would be acceptable.\n\n Is ""spurn"" a word? Yes: verb meaning to reject with disdain.\n\n Also, we introduce new letters: S, P, U, and we already know R and N.\n\n But note: we excluded C, A, E. S and P are common consonants, U is a vowel.\n\n So let\'s consider:\n\n   Previous absent letters: C, A, E -> so S, P, U are not C,A,E -> acceptable.\n\n   Now, we are also avoiding putting R at the wrong position? Yes: we have R at position 4 which is new.\n\n   And N at position 5 (new).\n\n So ""SPURN"" seems good.\n\n Another option: ""BURNS"": B,U,R,N,S -> positions: 1-B,2-U,3-R,4-N,5-S. \n   But then N is at position 4? But our first guess had N at position 4 and it was marked minus, meaning N cannot be at position 4. So we must avoid? Yes.\n\n Therefore, ""BURNS"" is invalid because it puts N at position 4.\n\n Similarly, ""GRIND"": G,R,I,N,D -> Positions: 1-G,2-R (we know R cannot be at position 2, so no), 3-I,4-N (but we know N cannot be at position 4). So avoid.\n\n How about ""GRUNT"": G,R,U,N,T -> positions: 1-G,2-R (cannot put R at 2 -> not allowed). So skip.\n\n Another: ""DRUNK"": D,R,U,N,K -> but R is at position 2? Avoid.\n\n ""URN"" related words? ""URINE"": U,R,I,N,E -> but E cannot be used because it\'s absent? No, the first feedback said E(x) meaning E is absent. So we cannot use E.\n\n So avoid ""URINE"".\n\n How about ""TRUNK"": T,R,U,N,K -> but R at position 2? Not allowed.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s put R in positions other than 2: either 1,3,4,5.\n\n Similarly, N in positions other than 4: 1,2,3,5.\n\n Consider ""PRUNS"": not common, maybe prune without e? Not valid.\n\n Another: ""ROUNDS"": 6 letters? No.\n\n A better one: ""SYRUP"": only 5 letters? Yes, but doesn\'t have N? Wait, we must include N because we know N is in the word.\n\n We cannot omit N because we must confirm where it is. Similarly for R.\n\n So we must include both R and N.\n\n Let\'s try ""RINDS"": R,I,N,D,S -> positions: 1-R, 2-I, 3-N (so N at position 3? That\'s new), 4-D,5-S. Now, R is at position 1 (not 2) -> okay. N at position 3 (not 4) -> okay. And letters: don\'t use C,A,E -> good.\n\n But we have R at position 1. Is that allowed? Yes, because the only constraint is R not at 2, so it could be at 1.\n\n Also, ""rinds"" is a word (e.g., orange rinds).\n\n Alternatively, ""NURSE"": N,U,R,S,E -> but E is absent (first feedback E marked x) so we cannot use E.\n\n Another: ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N -> positions: 1-M, 2-O, 3-U, 4-R, 5-N -> this is interesting: \n   R is at position 4 (not 2), N at position 5 (not 4) -> okay. \n   Letters: M, O, U, R, N -> no C,A,E -> valid.\n\n Is ""mourn"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n How about ""SPIRN"": not a word. Or ""HORNY"": H,O,R,N,Y -> positions: 1-H,2-O,3-R (R at position 3 -> not 2),4-N (but we cannot put N at position 4) -> skip because N at 4 is disallowed.\n\n Wait, in ""HORNY"", N is at position 4? Which is forbidden.\n\n So avoid.\n\n Now between ""MOURN"" and ""SPURN"", both seem valid? I also thought of ""RINDS"".\n\n Let me check if ""MOURN"" is 5 letters: yes. ""SPURN"": yes. ""RINDS"": yes.\n\n Which one to choose? We want to cover new letters. \n\n First guess letters: C,R,A,N,E -> we have used R and N. \n\n For second guess, we want to cover letters that are not tested: in ""MOURN"": we cover M, O, U, R, N -> R and N are repeated, so new: M, O, U.\n\n In ""SPURN"": S, P, U, R, N -> new: S, P, U.\n\n In ""RINDS"": R, I, N, D, S -> new: I, D, S.\n\n Which letters are more common?\n\n Among consonants: S, T, L, etc., vowels: O, U, I.\n\n Probably ""SPURN"" covers S, P (two consonants) and U (vowel). ""MOURN"" has M which is less common? But U and O are vowels.\n\n Since we haven\'t tested O, I, U, we might want to test one vowel? \n\n Alternatively, to avoid potential duplication of letters? The secret word might not have duplicates, but we don\'t know.\n\n Actually, Wordle can have duplicate letters? However, the feedback might show duplicated feedback? But in Wordle, if a letter appears twice but the secret only has one, then the second one might show as yellow or gray? But we don\'t know yet.\n\n But our first guess had no duplicates, and we got two yellow letters (R and N). So the word has R and N exactly? Or maybe it has duplicates? But we don\'t know.\n\n To be safe, we should choose a word without duplicates if possible.\n\n Also, note that ""SPURN"" has letters S, P, U, R, N: all distinct? Yes.\n\n ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N: distinct.\n\n ""RINDS"": R,I,N,D,S: distinct.\n\n Now, which word gives us more information? Covering more common letters.\n\n I think ""SPURN"" might be better because it includes S which is very common. P is common but less than some others. U is a vowel.\n\n Compare to ""RINDS"": includes I (vowel) and D,S. \n\n Another candidate: ""WORDS"": but has O, and S, but doesn\'t have N? Must have N.\n\n Because we know N is in the word. So words without N are invalid.\n\n We must use both R and N.\n\n I will go with ""SPURN"" as it covers S, P, U (new letters) and R, N (known) in new positions.\n\n So guess: SPURN\n\n Format our response.\n\n First, we do the reasoning above, then output.\n\n We say:\n <thinking>\n We have feedback from CRANE: C absent, R present but not in position 2, A absent, N present but not in position 4, E absent.\n Therefore, next guess must include R and N (placed in positions other than 2 and 4 respectively) and avoid C,A,E.\n We choose ""SPURN"": places R at position 4 (new) and N at position 5 (new). It introduces new letters S, P, U. It avoids the forbidden letters and positions.\n </thinking>\n Then: <guess>SPURN</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (C[x], R[-], A[x], N[-], E[x]), we know:\n- R and N are in the secret word but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.\n- C, A, and E are absent from the word.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include R and N, placed in new positions (avoiding position 2 for R and position 4 for N).\n- Avoid using C, A, E.\n- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.\n\nAfter considering options like ""MOURN"" and ""RINDS"", ""SPURN"" was selected because:\n- Positions: R at position 4 (≠2) and N at position 5 (≠4).\n- Uses new letters: S, P, U (common consonants and a vowel).\n- Valid 5-letter word meaning ""to reject disdainfully"".\n\n<guess>SPURN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPURN -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) U(x) R(-) N(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nMeaning:\n- C, A, E are absent from the word.\n- R is present but not in position 2.\n- N is present but not in position 4.\n\nGuess 2: SPURN -> S(x) P(x) U(x) R(-) N(-)\nMeaning:\n- S, P, U are absent from the word.\n- R is present but not in position 4 (since in SPURN, R is at position 4 and it\'s marked minus).\n- N is present but not in position 5 (since in SPURN, N is at position 5 and it\'s marked minus).\n\nNow, combining the information:\n\nAbsent letters: C, A, E, S, P, U.

So N must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 3.\n\nBut note: the word has 5 positions.

The alphabet minus absent letters: \nAbsent: C, A, E, S, P, U. So available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we should focus on common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, T, W, Y.\n\nNow, we need to form a 5-letter word with R and N, and three from the available letters.\n\nConstraints on positions:\n- R can be in positions 1, 3, 5.\n- N can be in positions 1, 2, 3.\n\nBut note: if we put R and N in the same word, we have to assign positions without conflict.\n\nAlso, we must avoid the positions where they were previously misplaced.\n\nLet\'s list possible positions for R and N:\n\nFor R: positions 1, 3, 5\nFor N: positions 1, 2, 3\n\nBut they cannot be in the same position? Actually, they are two different letters, so they can share a position? No, each position has one letter. So if R is at 1, then N cannot be at 1. Similarly, if R is at 3, then N cannot be at 3. And if R is at 5, then N can be at 1,2,3.\n\nSo possible combinations:\n\nCase 1: R at 1 -> then N can be at 2 or 3 (since 1 is taken).\nCase 2: R at 3 -> then N can be at 1 or 2 (since 3 is taken).\nCase 3: R at 5 -> then N can be at 1, 2, or 3.\n\nWe need to choose a word that fits one of these and uses available letters.\n\nWe also want to cover new common letters to get more information.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have R and N, and three other available letters.\n\nCommon patterns:\n\n- Words ending with R? But R at 5 is possible.\n\n- Words starting with R? Then R at 1.\n\n- Words with R in the middle.\n\nLet me brainstorm:\n\nOption 1: R at position 1, N at position 2: e.g., R N _ _ _\nBut what letters? We need three letters from available. Example: ROUND? But U is absent. RINSE? But S and E absent. RINSE has S and E which are absent. Not allowed.\n\nOption: R at 1, N at 3: R _ N _ _\nExample: ROBIN? But O and B are available? ROBIN: R, O, B, I, N -> but that\'s 5 letters? R at 1, O at 2, B at 3? No: positions: 1-R, 2-O, 3-B, 4-I, 5-N? But we want N at position 3? Then it would be R _ N _ _ -> so if N is at 3, then positions: 1-R, 2-?, 3-N, 4-?, 5-?.\n\nSo for R at 1, N at 3: words like: R A N _ _ -> but A is absent. R E N _ _ -> E absent. R I N _ _ -> like RINSE? But S and E absent. RINKY? Not a word. RINDY? Not common.\n\nAnother: R _ N _ _ with available letters: e.g., R O N D O? But O repeated? And D and O available. ""RONDO"" is 5 letters? R at 1, O at 2, N at 3, D at 4, O at 5? But O repeated? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But we can try. However, we have to avoid absent letters.\n\nBut ""RONDO"" has two O\'s? And O is available. But let\'s see: R at 1, O at 2, N at 3, D at 4, O at 5. But we have N at position 3? And R at 1. But in the feedback, we don\'t have any O or D tested yet. So it might be a candidate.\n\nBut is ""RONDO"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a musical form.\n\nBut we have two O\'s? The secret word might not have duplicates? But we don\'t know. It\'s acceptable to try.\n\nBut we have to consider other options.\n\nOption: R at 1, N at 2: R N _ _ _\nWords: RNZAA? Not valid. RNA? Not 5 letters. ROUND? U absent. RINSE? S and E absent. Not many common words.\n\nHow about R at 3? Then N at 1 or 2.\n\nCase: R at 3, N at 1: N _ R _ _\nExample: N O R M _ -> NORM? 4 letters. NORMAL? 6. N O R D S? But S absent. N O R I K? Not valid.\n\nCase: R at 3, N at 2: _ N R _ _\nExample: O N R E P? Not valid. B N R G? Not. Few words.\n\nCase: R at 5, then N at 1,2, or 3.\n\nSubcase: R at 5, N at 1: N _ _ _ R\nExample: N _ _ _ R: like ""LONER"" but L, O, N, E, R -> E absent. ""TONER"" -> T, O, N, E, R -> E absent. ""DINER"" -> E absent. ""MINER"" -> E absent. Since E is absent, we cannot use words ending with ER? But we have R at the end.\n\nWe need words without E. So N _ _ _ R without E.\n\nExample: ""MANOR"" -> M, A, N, O, R -> but A is absent. ""MINOR"" -> M, I, N, O, R -> but M, I, N, O, R: all available? Let\'s check: A absent? MINOR has no A, E, S, P, U, C. So M, I, N, O, R are all allowed.\n\nBut positions: N at 1? MINOR: M at 1, I at 2, N at 3, O at 4, R at 5. So R is at 5? That\'s allowed. N is at 3? But we have constraint: N cannot be at position 4 (from first guess) and not at 5 (from second guess), but position 3 is allowed. So N at 3 is okay.\n\nBut in MINOR, N is at position 3? Yes. And R at position 5? Yes.\n\nBut we also have to check if R and N are in new positions: \n- R: previously at position 2 (in CRANE) and 4 (in SPURN), now at 5: new position, good.\n- N: previously at position 4 (in CRANE) and 5 (in SPURN), now at 3: new position, good.\n\nSo ""MINOR"" is a candidate.\n\nSubcase: R at 5, N at 2: _ N _ _ R\nExample: O N L Y R? Not a word. I N F O R? Not 5. B N T R? Not. ""ONCER""? Not valid. ""INKER""? E absent. ""ANKER""? A absent. Not many.\n\nSubcase: R at 5, N at 3: _ _ N _ R\nExample: B O N G R? Not. T O N G R? Not. ""LONER"" but E absent. ""TONER"" E absent. ""HONOR"" -> H, O, N, O, R: positions: 1-H, 2-O, 3-N, 4-O, 5-R. So N at 3? Allowed. R at 5? Allowed. And letters: H, O, N, O, R -> O repeated? But H and O available. ""HONOR"" is a valid word.\n\nBut we have two O\'s? It might be acceptable.\n\nBut we already have ""MINOR"" without duplicates? MINOR has no duplicates.\n\nAnother candidate: ""MINOR"" and ""HONOR"".\n\nBut ""MINOR"" uses M, I, O, N, R.\n\nWe also have the case R at 1, N at 3: we had ""RONDO"" as a candidate? But ""RONDO"" has two O\'s.\n\nNow, to choose between these, we should pick one that covers new letters.\n\nWe have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nIn ""MINOR"": M, I, O, N, R -> new letters: M, I, O (N and R are known).\n\nIn ""HONOR"": H, O, N, O, R -> new: H, O (and O repeated).\n\nIn ""RONDO"": R, O, N, D, O -> new: O, D (and O repeated).\n\nWe want to maximize new information. ""MINOR"" introduces three new letters: M, I, O. ""HONOR"" introduces two: H, O (and one duplicate). ""RONDO"" introduces two: O, D (and one duplicate). So ""MINOR"" is better.\n\nBut we must ensure that the positions are correct: in ""MINOR"", R is at 5 and N is at 3? Let\'s write it:\n\nM I N O R\nPositions: 1-M, 2-I, 3-N, 4-O, 5-R.\n\nNow, constraints:\n- R: must not be at 2 or 4 -> 5 is okay.\n- N: must not be at 4 or 5 -> 3 is okay.\n\nSo it satisfies.\n\nIs there a word with more common letters? We could try to include T or L, which are very common.\n\nFor example, R at 5, N at 1: N _ _ _ R without E. We had ""MINOR"" but that has N at 3? Not at 1.\n\nWhat about N at 1 and R at 5: words like ""N__ _ R"": e.g., ""NADIR"" but A absent. ""NOMBR""? Not valid. ""NIGER""? E absent. ""NYMPH""? M, P? P is absent? P is absent from second guess. So no.\n\nAnother: ""NODER""? E absent.\n\nSo ""MINOR"" seems a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s check if there is a word with T? For example, ""MINTY""? But T and Y, but then R is missing? We must include R and N.\n\n""MINOR"" has R and N.\n\nAnother candidate: ""TRIBE"" but E absent and B? But we need R and N. ""TRIBE"" has R but not N? So no.\n\n""BRING"": B, R, I, N, G -> positions: 1-B, 2-R (but R cannot be at position 2! from first guess). So invalid.\n\n""GRIND"": G, R, I, N, D -> R at position 2? Not allowed.\n\n""DRINK"": D, R, I, N, K -> R at 2? Not allowed.\n\n""PRINT"": P is absent.\n\nSo ""MINOR"" seems solid.\n\nWe could also consider ""ROBIN"", but in ""ROBIN"": R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, I at 4, N at 5. But N at 5? We know from second guess that N cannot be at position 5 (because in SPURN, N at 5 was minus). So N at 5 is disallowed. Therefore, ""ROBIN"" is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""ORBIN""? Not a word.\n\nAnother: ""RHINO"": R, H, I, N, O -> positions: 1-R, 2-H, 3-I, 4-N, 5-O. But N at position 4? We know from first guess that N cannot be at position 4 (CRANE had N at 4 and minus). So invalid.\n\nTherefore, ""MINOR"" is a good candidate.\n\nSo I will go with ""MINOR"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters: M, I, N, O, R. \n- M: not tested before -> new.\n- I: not tested -> new.\n- O: not tested -> new.\n- N: known present.\n- R: known present.\n\nAnd positions: R at 5 (allowed), N at 3 (allowed).\n\nSo we can use this.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""MINOR"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, A, E absent; R and N present but not in positions 2 and 4.\n- **Guess 2 (SPURN)**: S, P, U absent; R and N present but not in positions 4 and 5.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Absent letters**: C, A, E, S, P, U (cannot be used).\n- **Present letters**: R and N must be included.\n- **Position constraints**:\n  - R cannot be in position 2 (from CRANE) or 4 (from SPURN), so R must be in position 1, 3, or 5.\n  - N cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE) or 5 (from SPURN), so N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (focus on common letters like M, I, O, T, L).\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Must include R and N in valid positions (avoiding disallowed slots).\n- Use new, common letters to maximize information (e.g., M, I, O).\n- Avoid repeating positions for R and N from previous guesses.\n- ""MINOR"" was chosen because:\n  - Positions: R at 5 (allowed, not 2 or 4), N at 3 (allowed, not 4 or 5).\n  - Letters: M, I, O are new and common; N and R are confirmed present.\n  - Valid 5-letter word meaning ""lesser in importance"".\n  - Tests three new letters (M, I, O) while respecting constraints.\n\n<guess>MINOR</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPURN -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) U(x) R(-) N(-)\nGuess 3: MINOR -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
  - Absent: C, A, E
  - Present but wrong position: R (not pos2), N (not pos4)

Guess 2: SPURN -> S(x) P(x) U(x) R(-) N(-)
  - Absent: S, P, U
  - Present but wrong position: R (not pos4), N (not pos5)

Guess 3: MINOR -> M(x) I(x) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)
  - Absent: M, I
  - Correct position: N at position 3, O at position 4, R at position 5

Now, from Guess 3, we have:
  - N is at position 3 (since it's correct, and in MINOR, N is at position 3)
  - O is at position 4 (correct)
  - R is at position 5 (correct)

So the secret word has:
  - Position 3: N
  - Position 4: O
  - Position 5: R

And we know from previous that R and N are present, which is consistent.

Now, we need to find the first two letters.

We also have a list of absent letters: C, A, E, S, P, U, M, I.

So absent: A, C, E, I, M, P, S, U.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: O and R and N are already placed, so we don't need to guess them again. We only need to guess positions 1 and 2.

The secret word pattern: _ _ N O R

We know the first two letters must be from the available letters, and not in the absent list.

We also have constraints from previous feedback about R and N positions, but now we have fixed their positions, so that is satisfied.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word of the form _ _ N O R.

What are possible words?

Common words ending with ""NOR"": like MINOR (but M and I are absent, and we already tried), so not.

Other words: 
  - ""TONOR""? Not a word.
  - ""DONOR"": D, O, N, O, R? But that would be D at 1, O at 2, N at 3, O at 4, R at 5? But we have O at 4? In DONOR, the positions are: 1-D, 2-O, 3-N, 4-O, 5-R? But we have O at position 4? That is correct, but we also have O at position 2? And we don't know if O can be duplicated? But in the feedback for MINOR, O was at position 4 and correct, but we don't have information about O at other positions.

However, in DONOR, there are two O's. But the secret word might have only one O? We don't know.

But let's see: the feedback for MINOR had O at position 4 correct, but it doesn't tell us about other O's. So it's possible that there is another O? But we have to consider.

But we also have the absent letters: we don't have O as absent, so it could be present multiple times? But we don't know.

To be safe, we should consider both possibilities.

But let's list possible words ending with NOR.

Common words: 
  - ""DONOR"": D, O, N, O, R -> positions: 1-D, 2-O, 3-N, 4-O, 5-R. But we have O at position 4? That is fixed. But in this word, position 2 is also O. Is that allowed? Yes, if the word has two O's.

But we need to check if D is available? D is not in absent list, so yes.

Another word: ""HONOR"": H, O, N, O, R -> same as above: 1-H, 2-O, 3-N, 4-O, 5-R. H is available.

But in ""HONOR"", we have O at position 2 and 4. We know position 4 is O, so position 2 being O is possible? Yes.

But we also have ""MINOR"" which we tried, but M and I are absent.

Another: ""TONOR"" not a word.

""JUNOR""? Not.

""LONOR""? Not.

""WONOR""? Not.

""BONOR""? Not.

""GONOR""? Not.

""CONOR""? But C is absent.

So the only common words I can think of are ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"".

But both have O at position 2? And we have O at position 4.

We also have ""TENOR"": T, E, N, O, R -> but E is absent (from first guess). So not allowed.

""VENOR""? Not a word.

""LENOR""? Not.

""RENOR""? Not.

""ZENOR""? Not.

So ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"" are the main candidates.

But we must consider: in ""DONOR"", the first letter is D and second is O. In ""HONOR"", first is H and second is O.

We need to guess one of these? But we don't know which.

We could also consider that the word might not have O at position 2? But what other words are there?

Another possibility: ""MANOR"" but M is absent and A is absent? ""MANOR"" has M and A, both absent.

""MINOR"" we tried.

""BONUS"" but S absent and U absent, and not ending with NOR.

We are fixed to _ _ N O R.

Perhaps ""FJORD""? But that's F, J, O, R, D -> positions: 1-F, 2-J, 3-O, 4-R, 5-D? But we need position 3 to be N, not O. So no.

All words must have N at position 3, O at 4, R at 5.

So the only common words are ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"".

But note: in ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"", the second letter is O. But we have O already at position 4. If the word has only one O, then having O at position 2 would be incorrect? But we don't know.

In the feedback for MINOR, we had O at position 4 correct, but if there were another O, it might have been indicated? In Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback can be tricky.

Recall: in MINOR, we had M(x) I(x) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓). The O was at position 4 and marked correct. If there were another O in the secret word, say at position 2, then in MINOR, we don't have a letter at position 2 that is O? MINOR has I at position 2, which is not O, so if the secret word had O at position 2, then for the O in MINOR at position 4, it would still be correct (green), but the absence of O at position 2 wouldn't be directly indicated because we didn't guess O there. However, if we had guessed a letter that is not O at a position where O is, it would be a yellow or something? But in MINOR, at position 2 we guessed I, which is not O, and if the secret word had O at position 2, then I should be marked as absent? But in the feedback, I is marked absent (x), meaning I is not in the word at all. So if the secret word had O at position 2, and we guessed I at position 2, then I would be marked as not present (x) only if I is not in the word, which is consistent. But it doesn't tell us about O at position 2.

Actually, the feedback for MINOR: I is marked x, meaning the letter I is not in the word. So the secret word does not contain I. Similarly, M is not in the word.

But for O: we have O at position 4 and it's correct, but if there is another O, we don't know because we didn't guess it elsewhere.

So it's possible that the secret word has another O? For example, in position 2.

Therefore, ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"" are possible.

But we need to choose one to guess.

We could also consider if there are words without O at position 2? But we couldn't think of any.

Another word: ""DINOR""? Not a word.

""KINOR""? Not.

""LINOR""? Not.

""WINOR""? Not.

""YONOR""? Not.

So it seems ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"" are the only common ones.

But let's check: ""DONOR"" is valid, ""HONOR"" is valid.

We can also consider ""FJORD"" but that doesn't have N at position 3.

Perhaps ""ANNOY"" but not ending with NOR.

I think we have to go with one of these.

But note: in ""DONOR"", the first letter is D, which is available. In ""HONOR"", first letter is H, available.

We don't have any information about D or H.

We could guess one of them and see.

But we have only 3 guesses left? We are on the fourth guess? Let me count: we had guess 1,2,3, so this is guess 4.

We can try to guess a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained to _ _ N O R, so we have to fill the first two positions.

We could guess ""DONOR"" to test D and the double O? Or ""HONOR"" for H.

But we might also consider that the word might not have a vowel at position 2? But in ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"", position 2 is O, a vowel.

Is there a word with a consonant at position 2? For example, ""BONOR"" not a word. ""GONOR"" not. ""KNOTS"" not.

Another idea: ""SNORE"" but S and E absent.

""STORE"" E absent.

So I think we have to choose between ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"".

But let's see the definition: both are valid.

Perhaps we can use a word that has different letters to get more information? But we are forced to have N, O, R at the end, so the first two letters are the only unknowns.

If we guess ""DONOR"", and it's wrong, we get feedback on D and the second O.

Similarly for ""HONOR"".

But we might run out of guesses? We have 3 guesses left? Actually, Wordle has 6 guesses total, we used 3, so 3 left.

We can also consider that the secret word might be ""MINOR"" but we know M and I are absent, so it can't be.

Another word: ""MANOR"" but M and A absent.

""LONER"" but E absent and L? But LONER has E.

""TONER"" E absent.

""CONOR"" C absent.

So I think ""DONOR"" or ""HONOR"" are the only options.

But let's check if there is a word like ""DONOR"" but without the second O? No, because it must end with NOR.

Perhaps ""DINAR"" but not NOR.

I think we have to pick one.

Let me choose ""HONOR"" because H is a common consonant.

But in ""HONOR"", the first letter is H, second is O.

We know O is at position 4, so if we guess ""HONOR"", and if the secret word is ""HONOR"", then we win.

If it's ""DONOR"", then we get feedback that H is absent? But H is at position 1, and if it's not H, then we know it must be D? Because only two options.

Similarly, if we guess ""DONOR"" and it's not, then we know it must be ""HONOR"".

So we can do that.

But we have to be careful: what if there is another word? For example, ""XENON"" but not ending with R.

I think for now, we'll assume it's one of these two.

So I'll guess ""HONOR"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""HONOR"":
  - Position 1: H -> if the secret word is ""HONOR"", then H is correct (✓). If it's ""DONOR"", then H is absent (x) because D is there.
  - Position 2: O -> in both cases, if the secret word has O at position 2? But in ""DONOR"", position 2 is O, so if we guess O at position 2, and it is present, it should be yellow or green? But in ""DONOR"", O is at position 2 and 4. If we guess O at position 2, and the secret word is ""DONOR"", then since position 2 is O, it would be green? But we don't know if the secret word has O at position 2.

In ""HONOR"", we have O at position 2 and 4.

In ""DONOR"", we have O at position 2 and 4.

So both have O at position 2 and 4.

Therefore, if we guess ""HONOR"", then:
  - Position 1: H -> if secret is ""HONOR"", ✓; if ""DONOR"", then H is absent (x) because ""DONOR"" has D at 1, not H.
  - Position 2: O -> in both cases, O is at position 2 in the secret? Yes, both words have O at 2, so it should be green (✓) for both.
  - Position 3: N -> green (✓) for both.
  - Position 4: O -> green (✓) for both.
  - Position 5: R -> green (✓) for both.

So the feedback for ""HONOR"" would be:
  - If secret is ""HONOR"": H(✓) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓) -> all correct.
  - If secret is ""DONOR"": H(x) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓) -> because H is absent, but O at position 2 is correct.

Similarly, if we guess ""DONOR"":
  - If secret is ""DONOR"": all ✓.
  - If secret is ""HONOR"": D(x) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓).

So in either case, we can distinguish.

But we don't know if the secret word is one of these.

But let's assume it is.

So I'll guess ""HONOR"".

But is there a possibility of another word? For example, ""OCTOR""? Not a word.

""ACTOR"" but A and C absent.

So I think it's safe.

Therefore, we guess ""HONOR"".

But note: in the feedback for MINOR, we had O at position 4 correct, but we didn't have O at position 2. So if the secret word has O at position 2, we don't know. But in ""HONOR"", we are guessing O at position 2, so we'll find out.

But we must consider that the secret word might not have O at position 2? But we couldn't find any other word.

Another word: ""JUNOR"" not.

""VOTOR""? Not.

I think we have to go with it.

So guess: HONOR

But let's output.
</think>
### Analysis of Feedback and Current State

After three guesses, we have the following information:

1. **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
   - C (absent), R (present but not position 2), A (absent), N (present but not position 4), E (absent).
   - **Absent letters**: C, A, E.
   - **Present letters**: R, N (with position constraints).

2. **Guess 2 (SPURN)**:
   - S (absent), P (absent), U (absent), R (present but not position 4), N (present but not position 5).
   - **New absent letters**: S, P, U.
   - **Updated position constraints for R and N**: R cannot be in position 2 or 4; N cannot be in position 4 or 5.

3. **Guess 3 (MINOR)**:
   - M (absent), I (absent), N (correct position, position 3), O (correct position, position 4), R (correct position, position 5).
   - **New absent letters**: M, I.
   - **Confirmed positions**: 
     - Position 3: N
     - Position 4: O
     - Position 5: R

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word structure**: The word must be `_ _ N O R` (positions 3, 4, and 5 are fixed as N, O, R).
- **Absent letters (cannot use)**: A, C, E, I, M, P, S, U (8 letters).
- **Available letters for positions 1 and 2**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (focus on common letters like D, H, L, T).
- **Position constraints for R and N are satisfied** (R at 5, N at 3).
- **O is confirmed at position 4**, but it may appear elsewhere (e.g., position 2) since we haven't tested other positions for O.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We need to guess a valid 5-letter word of the form `_ _ N O R`.
- Common English words fitting this pattern:
  - **HONOR**: Positions: H (1), O (2), N (3), O (4), R (5).
  - **DONOR**: Positions: D (1), O (2), N (3), O (4), R (5).
- Both words are valid and use available letters. No other common words fit the pattern (e.g., ""TONOR"" is invalid, ""MINOR"" is ruled out due to M and I being absent).
- **Why choose ""HONOR""?**
  - It tests H (a common consonant) and the possibility of O at position 2.
  - Feedback will be decisive:
    - If ""HONOR"" is correct, all positions will be green (✓).
    - If incorrect (e.g., secret is ""DONOR""), feedback will show H as absent (x) and O at position 2 as correct (✓), narrowing it to ""DONOR"" for the next guess.
- We have 3 guesses remaining, so this is a safe, information-maximizing choice.

<guess>HONOR</guess>",HONOR,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
  - Absent: C, A, E
  - Present but wrong position: R (not pos2), N (not pos4)

Guess 2: SPURN -> S(x) P(x) U(x) R(-) N(-)
  - Absent: S, P, U
  - Present but wrong position: R (not pos4), N (not pos5)

Guess 3: MINOR -> M(x) I(x) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)
  - Absent: M, I
  - Correct position: N at position 3, O at position 4, R at position 5

Now, from Guess 3, we have:
  - N is at position 3 (since it's correct, and in MINOR, N is at position 3)
  - O is at position 4 (correct)
  - R is at position 5 (correct)

So the secret word has:
  - Position 3: N
  - Position 4: O
  - Position 5: R

And we know from previous that R and N are present, which is consistent.

Now, we need to find the first two letters.

We also have a list of absent letters: C, A, E, S, P, U, M, I.

So absent: A, C, E, I, M, P, S, U.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: O and R and N are already placed, so we don't need to guess them again. We only need to guess positions 1 and 2.

The secret word pattern: _ _ N O R

We know the first two letters must be from the available letters, and not in the absent list.

We also have constraints from previous feedback about R and N positions, but now we have fixed their positions, so that is satisfied.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word of the form _ _ N O R.

What are possible words?

Common words ending with ""NOR"": like MINOR (but M and I are absent, and we already tried), so not.

Other words: 
  - ""TONOR""? Not a word.
  - ""DONOR"": D, O, N, O, R? But that would be D at 1, O at 2, N at 3, O at 4, R at 5? But we have O at 4? In DONOR, the positions are: 1-D, 2-O, 3-N, 4-O, 5-R? But we have O at position 4? That is correct, but we also have O at position 2? And we don't know if O can be duplicated? But in the feedback for MINOR, O was at position 4 and correct, but we don't have information about O at other positions.

However, in DONOR, there are two O's. But the secret word might have only one O? We don't know.

But let's see: the feedback for MINOR had O at position 4 correct, but it doesn't tell us about other O's. So it's possible that there is another O? But we have to consider.

But we also have the absent letters: we don't have O as absent, so it could be present multiple times? But we don't know.

To be safe, we should consider both possibilities.

But let's list possible words ending with NOR.

Common words: 
  - ""DONOR"": D, O, N, O, R -> positions: 1-D, 2-O, 3-N, 4-O, 5-R. But we have O at position 4? That is fixed. But in this word, position 2 is also O. Is that allowed? Yes, if the word has two O's.

But we need to check if D is available? D is not in absent list, so yes.

Another word: ""HONOR"": H, O, N, O, R -> same as above: 1-H, 2-O, 3-N, 4-O, 5-R. H is available.

But in ""HONOR"", we have O at position 2 and 4. We know position 4 is O, so position 2 being O is possible? Yes.

But we also have ""MINOR"" which we tried, but M and I are absent.

Another: ""TONOR"" not a word.

""JUNOR""? Not.

""LONOR""? Not.

""WONOR""? Not.

""BONOR""? Not.

""GONOR""? Not.

""CONOR""? But C is absent.

So the only common words I can think of are ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"".

But both have O at position 2? And we have O at position 4.

We also have ""TENOR"": T, E, N, O, R -> but E is absent (from first guess). So not allowed.

""VENOR""? Not a word.

""LENOR""? Not.

""RENOR""? Not.

""ZENOR""? Not.

So ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"" are the main candidates.

But we must consider: in ""DONOR"", the first letter is D and second is O. In ""HONOR"", first is H and second is O.

We need to guess one of these? But we don't know which.

We could also consider that the word might not have O at position 2? But what other words are there?

Another possibility: ""MANOR"" but M is absent and A is absent? ""MANOR"" has M and A, both absent.

""MINOR"" we tried.

""BONUS"" but S absent and U absent, and not ending with NOR.

We are fixed to _ _ N O R.

Perhaps ""FJORD""? But that's F, J, O, R, D -> positions: 1-F, 2-J, 3-O, 4-R, 5-D? But we need position 3 to be N, not O. So no.

All words must have N at position 3, O at 4, R at 5.

So the only common words are ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"".

But note: in ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"", the second letter is O. But we have O already at position 4. If the word has only one O, then having O at position 2 would be incorrect? But we don't know.

In the feedback for MINOR, we had O at position 4 correct, but if there were another O, it might have been indicated? In Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback can be tricky.

Recall: in MINOR, we had M(x) I(x) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓). The O was at position 4 and marked correct. If there were another O in the secret word, say at position 2, then in MINOR, we don't have a letter at position 2 that is O? MINOR has I at position 2, which is not O, so if the secret word had O at position 2, then for the O in MINOR at position 4, it would still be correct (green), but the absence of O at position 2 wouldn't be directly indicated because we didn't guess O there. However, if we had guessed a letter that is not O at a position where O is, it would be a yellow or something? But in MINOR, at position 2 we guessed I, which is not O, and if the secret word had O at position 2, then I should be marked as absent? But in the feedback, I is marked absent (x), meaning I is not in the word at all. So if the secret word had O at position 2, and we guessed I at position 2, then I would be marked as not present (x) only if I is not in the word, which is consistent. But it doesn't tell us about O at position 2.

Actually, the feedback for MINOR: I is marked x, meaning the letter I is not in the word. So the secret word does not contain I. Similarly, M is not in the word.

But for O: we have O at position 4 and it's correct, but if there is another O, we don't know because we didn't guess it elsewhere.

So it's possible that the secret word has another O? For example, in position 2.

Therefore, ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"" are possible.

But we need to choose one to guess.

We could also consider if there are words without O at position 2? But we couldn't think of any.

Another word: ""DINOR""? Not a word.

""KINOR""? Not.

""LINOR""? Not.

""WINOR""? Not.

""YONOR""? Not.

So it seems ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"" are the only common ones.

But let's check: ""DONOR"" is valid, ""HONOR"" is valid.

We can also consider ""FJORD"" but that doesn't have N at position 3.

Perhaps ""ANNOY"" but not ending with NOR.

I think we have to go with one of these.

But note: in ""DONOR"", the first letter is D, which is available. In ""HONOR"", first letter is H, available.

We don't have any information about D or H.

We could guess one of them and see.

But we have only 3 guesses left? We are on the fourth guess? Let me count: we had guess 1,2,3, so this is guess 4.

We can try to guess a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained to _ _ N O R, so we have to fill the first two positions.

We could guess ""DONOR"" to test D and the double O? Or ""HONOR"" for H.

But we might also consider that the word might not have a vowel at position 2? But in ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"", position 2 is O, a vowel.

Is there a word with a consonant at position 2? For example, ""BONOR"" not a word. ""GONOR"" not. ""KNOTS"" not.

Another idea: ""SNORE"" but S and E absent.

""STORE"" E absent.

So I think we have to choose between ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"".

But let's see the definition: both are valid.

Perhaps we can use a word that has different letters to get more information? But we are forced to have N, O, R at the end, so the first two letters are the only unknowns.

If we guess ""DONOR"", and it's wrong, we get feedback on D and the second O.

Similarly for ""HONOR"".

But we might run out of guesses? We have 3 guesses left? Actually, Wordle has 6 guesses total, we used 3, so 3 left.

We can also consider that the secret word might be ""MINOR"" but we know M and I are absent, so it can't be.

Another word: ""MANOR"" but M and A absent.

""LONER"" but E absent and L? But LONER has E.

""TONER"" E absent.

""CONOR"" C absent.

So I think ""DONOR"" or ""HONOR"" are the only options.

But let's check if there is a word like ""DONOR"" but without the second O? No, because it must end with NOR.

Perhaps ""DINAR"" but not NOR.

I think we have to pick one.

Let me choose ""HONOR"" because H is a common consonant.

But in ""HONOR"", the first letter is H, second is O.

We know O is at position 4, so if we guess ""HONOR"", and if the secret word is ""HONOR"", then we win.

If it's ""DONOR"", then we get feedback that H is absent? But H is at position 1, and if it's not H, then we know it must be D? Because only two options.

Similarly, if we guess ""DONOR"" and it's not, then we know it must be ""HONOR"".

So we can do that.

But we have to be careful: what if there is another word? For example, ""XENON"" but not ending with R.

I think for now, we'll assume it's one of these two.

So I'll guess ""HONOR"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""HONOR"":
  - Position 1: H -> if the secret word is ""HONOR"", then H is correct (✓). If it's ""DONOR"", then H is absent (x) because D is there.
  - Position 2: O -> in both cases, if the secret word has O at position 2? But in ""DONOR"", position 2 is O, so if we guess O at position 2, and it is present, it should be yellow or green? But in ""DONOR"", O is at position 2 and 4. If we guess O at position 2, and the secret word is ""DONOR"", then since position 2 is O, it would be green? But we don't know if the secret word has O at position 2.

In ""HONOR"", we have O at position 2 and 4.

In ""DONOR"", we have O at position 2 and 4.

So both have O at position 2 and 4.

Therefore, if we guess ""HONOR"", then:
  - Position 1: H -> if secret is ""HONOR"", ✓; if ""DONOR"", then H is absent (x) because ""DONOR"" has D at 1, not H.
  - Position 2: O -> in both cases, O is at position 2 in the secret? Yes, both words have O at 2, so it should be green (✓) for both.
  - Position 3: N -> green (✓) for both.
  - Position 4: O -> green (✓) for both.
  - Position 5: R -> green (✓) for both.

So the feedback for ""HONOR"" would be:
  - If secret is ""HONOR"": H(✓) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓) -> all correct.
  - If secret is ""DONOR"": H(x) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓) -> because H is absent, but O at position 2 is correct.

Similarly, if we guess ""DONOR"":
  - If secret is ""DONOR"": all ✓.
  - If secret is ""HONOR"": D(x) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓).

So in either case, we can distinguish.

But we don't know if the secret word is one of these.

But let's assume it is.

So I'll guess ""HONOR"".

But is there a possibility of another word? For example, ""OCTOR""? Not a word.

""ACTOR"" but A and C absent.

So I think it's safe.

Therefore, we guess ""HONOR"".

But note: in the feedback for MINOR, we had O at position 4 correct, but we didn't have O at position 2. So if the secret word has O at position 2, we don't know. But in ""HONOR"", we are guessing O at position 2, so we'll find out.

But we must consider that the secret word might not have O at position 2? But we couldn't find any other word.

Another word: ""JUNOR"" not.

""VOTOR""? Not.

I think we have to go with it.

So guess: HONOR

But let's output.### Analysis of Feedback and Current State

After three guesses, we have the following information:

1. **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
   - C (absent), R (present but not position 2), A (absent), N (present but not position 4), E (absent).
   - **Absent letters**: C, A, E.
   - **Present letters**: R, N (with position constraints).

2. **Guess 2 (SPURN)**:
   - S (absent), P (absent), U (absent), R (present but not position 4), N (present but not position 5).
   - **New absent letters**: S, P, U.
   - **Updated position constraints for R and N**: R cannot be in position 2 or 4; N cannot be in position 4 or 5.

3. **Guess 3 (MINOR)**:
   - M (absent), I (absent), N (correct position, position 3), O (correct position, position 4), R (correct position, position 5).
   - **New absent letters**: M, I.
   - **Confirmed positions**: 
     - Position 3: N
     - Position 4: O
     - Position 5: R

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word structure**: The word must be `_ _ N O R` (positions 3, 4, and 5 are fixed as N, O, R).
- **Absent letters (cannot use)**: A, C, E, I, M, P, S, U (8 letters).
- **Available letters for positions 1 and 2**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (focus on common letters like D, H, L, T).
- **Position constraints for R and N are satisfied** (R at 5, N at 3).
- **O is confirmed at position 4**, but it may appear elsewhere (e.g., position 2) since we haven't tested other positions for O.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We need to guess a valid 5-letter word of the form `_ _ N O R`.
- Common English words fitting this pattern:
  - **HONOR**: Positions: H (1), O (2), N (3), O (4), R (5).
  - **DONOR**: Positions: D (1), O (2), N (3), O (4), R (5).
- Both words are valid and use available letters. No other common words fit the pattern (e.g., ""TONOR"" is invalid, ""MINOR"" is ruled out due to M and I being absent).
- **Why choose ""HONOR""?**
  - It tests H (a common consonant) and the possibility of O at position 2.
  - Feedback will be decisive:
    - If ""HONOR"" is correct, all positions will be green (✓).
    - If incorrect (e.g., secret is ""DONOR""), feedback will show H as absent (x) and O at position 2 as correct (✓), narrowing it to ""DONOR"" for the next guess.
- We have 3 guesses remaining, so this is a safe, information-maximizing choice.",Guess 4: HONOR -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,donor,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to make the first guess for a Wordle game. Since I don't have any information yet, I should start with a word that has common letters to maximize the feedback I get.

Common vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U. Common consonants include R, S, T, L, N, etc. A good starter word often uses several of these to cover more possibilities.

Popular first guesses in Wordle are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", or ""ADIEU"". These use a mix of vowels and common consonants.

I should choose a word that has no repeating letters since that could waste a guess if letters are unique.

Let me list out some options:

- ""CRANE"": C, R, A, N, E – has A and E vowels, R and N common consonants.

- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – similar, with S,T,L.

- ""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T – has O instead of E.

""ADIEU"" has A,I,E,U which are vowels, but it misses some consonants, so it might not be as balanced.

Another good one is ""RADIO"" or ""MEDIA"".

I think ""CRANE"" is often recommended because it covers C,R,A,N,E – all common letters.

Alternatives: ""SALET"" is a word, but less common.

Since I need a valid English word, I'll stick with common ones.

Let me go with ""CRANE"". It's a solid choice for a first guess.

So, my guess will be ""CRANE"".

Now, for the response format, I need to output my thought process within <think> <thinking>tags, and then the guess in

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(x)
 So, the secret word has the letter R and N somewhere, but not in those positions (since they are marked minus), and does not have C, A, or E.

 Specifically:
   - C is not in the secret word (marked x)
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (since our guess was C-R-A-N-E, and positions are 1-based? or 0-based? Actually, in the feedback, we say position of R is 2? Let's index from 1: position 1=C, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=E).

 But note: the secret word has R, but not at position 2, and has N, but not at position 4. Also, the letters C, A, and E are absent.

 Now, we know that R and N are in the word, so we must include them in our next guess. And avoid C, A, E.

 Also, we have 5 positions to guess. We need to choose a word with R and N, but not C, A, E.

 Additionally, R cannot be in position 2 and N cannot be in position 4.

 Let's think of words that include R and N, and try to cover new common letters.

 What are other common letters? We can try to use vowels that haven't been checked. We didn't check O, U, I, etc. And consonants like T, L, S, D, etc.

 Our new guess should have R and N, put them in different positions than before (so R not at spot 2, N not at spot 4), and include three new letters that are possible.

 We also want to avoid A and E (since absent) and C (absent).

 Possible candidate: ""R"" must be somewhere else, say positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: if we put R at position 1, that might be a possibility. Similarly for N, we can put it at positions 1,2,3,5? (but in guess we can try any position).

 However, we must use valid English words.

 Let me brainstorm words with R and N, and excluding A, E, C.

 Examples:
   - ""HORNS"": H, O, R, N, S -> but we have O which is a new vowel, and S common.
   - ""BORNS"": not valid word? Actually, borns is not common, but ""barns"" has A which is excluded.
   - ""PORNS"": that might be sensitive and probably not suitable? Avoid.
   - ""WORNS"": not valid? Perhaps ""worn"" is base, but we need 5 letters.

   - Another: ""DARN"" but that's 4 letters. We need 5.

   - ""TORN"": only 4 letters.

   - ""RUNTY"": but has Y and T, and 5 letters? Actually, ""runty"" is an adjective meaning small and weak, valid.

   However, we don't have many letters covered. Let's try to include another vowel?

   Since A and E are out, we can try I, O, U.

 Let me think: ""PRINT"": P, R, I, N, T -> has R and N? R at position 2? But in our first guess R was at pos2 and it was minus meaning not there. So in ""PRINT"", R is at pos2? We cannot put R at position 2. So ""PRINT"" would put R again at the same position which is bad because we know R is not at position 2.

 We must avoid putting R at position 2.

 Similarly, avoid N at position 4.

 So ""PRINT"" is not good then? But if we change the position: let's see if we can move R elsewhere.

 Alternatively, ""ROUND"": R, O, U, N, D -> R is at position 1? Then N is at position 4? But we cannot put N at position 4 because that was the position where we had N and it was minus, meaning N is in the word but not at position 4.

 So if we put N at position 4 in this guess, it would be invalid because we know it's not there. Therefore, we must avoid that.

 Therefore, in ""ROUND"": 
   position 1: R -> R cannot be at position 1? No, we don't know about position 1 yet. Only that R cannot be at position 2 (from previous guess). So putting R at 1 is okay? But wait: when we had CRANE, R was at position 2 and got minus. So R must be at a position other than 2. Similarly, N must be at a position other than 4.

 ""ROUND"" has R at position 1 (which is new) and N at position 4? Not allowed because from the first guess, N was at position 4 and marked minus meaning it cannot be at position 4. So ""ROUND"" would have N at position 4 again? That would be bad.

 Therefore, skip ""ROUND"".

 What about ""SPURN"": S, P, U, R, N -> positions: 1-S,2-P,3-U,4-R,5-N? 
   Then R is at position 4 -> which is different than position 2? Yes. And N is at position 5 -> different from position 4? Yes. 
   So this would be acceptable.

 Is ""spurn"" a word? Yes: verb meaning to reject with disdain.

 Also, we introduce new letters: S, P, U, and we already know R and N.

 But note: we excluded C, A, E. S and P are common consonants, U is a vowel.

 So let's consider:

   Previous absent letters: C, A, E -> so S, P, U are not C,A,E -> acceptable.

   Now, we are also avoiding putting R at the wrong position? Yes: we have R at position 4 which is new.

   And N at position 5 (new).

 So ""SPURN"" seems good.

 Another option: ""BURNS"": B,U,R,N,S -> positions: 1-B,2-U,3-R,4-N,5-S. 
   But then N is at position 4? But our first guess had N at position 4 and it was marked minus, meaning N cannot be at position 4. So we must avoid? Yes.

 Therefore, ""BURNS"" is invalid because it puts N at position 4.

 Similarly, ""GRIND"": G,R,I,N,D -> Positions: 1-G,2-R (we know R cannot be at position 2, so no), 3-I,4-N (but we know N cannot be at position 4). So avoid.

 How about ""GRUNT"": G,R,U,N,T -> positions: 1-G,2-R (cannot put R at 2 -> not allowed). So skip.

 Another: ""DRUNK"": D,R,U,N,K -> but R is at position 2? Avoid.

 ""URN"" related words? ""URINE"": U,R,I,N,E -> but E cannot be used because it's absent? No, the first feedback said E(x) meaning E is absent. So we cannot use E.

 So avoid ""URINE"".

 How about ""TRUNK"": T,R,U,N,K -> but R at position 2? Not allowed.

 Alternatively, let's put R in positions other than 2: either 1,3,4,5.

 Similarly, N in positions other than 4: 1,2,3,5.

 Consider ""PRUNS"": not common, maybe prune without e? Not valid.

 Another: ""ROUNDS"": 6 letters? No.

 A better one: ""SYRUP"": only 5 letters? Yes, but doesn't have N? Wait, we must include N because we know N is in the word.

 We cannot omit N because we must confirm where it is. Similarly for R.

 So we must include both R and N.

 Let's try ""RINDS"": R,I,N,D,S -> positions: 1-R, 2-I, 3-N (so N at position 3? That's new), 4-D,5-S. Now, R is at position 1 (not 2) -> okay. N at position 3 (not 4) -> okay. And letters: don't use C,A,E -> good.

 But we have R at position 1. Is that allowed? Yes, because the only constraint is R not at 2, so it could be at 1.

 Also, ""rinds"" is a word (e.g., orange rinds).

 Alternatively, ""NURSE"": N,U,R,S,E -> but E is absent (first feedback E marked x) so we cannot use E.

 Another: ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N -> positions: 1-M, 2-O, 3-U, 4-R, 5-N -> this is interesting: 
   R is at position 4 (not 2), N at position 5 (not 4) -> okay. 
   Letters: M, O, U, R, N -> no C,A,E -> valid.

 Is ""mourn"" a valid word? Yes.

 How about ""SPIRN"": not a word. Or ""HORNY"": H,O,R,N,Y -> positions: 1-H,2-O,3-R (R at position 3 -> not 2),4-N (but we cannot put N at position 4) -> skip because N at 4 is disallowed.

 Wait, in ""HORNY"", N is at position 4? Which is forbidden.

 So avoid.

 Now between ""MOURN"" and ""SPURN"", both seem valid? I also thought of ""RINDS"".

 Let me check if ""MOURN"" is 5 letters: yes. ""SPURN"": yes. ""RINDS"": yes.

 Which one to choose? We want to cover new letters. 

 First guess letters: C,R,A,N,E -> we have used R and N. 

 For second guess, we want to cover letters that are not tested: in ""MOURN"": we cover M, O, U, R, N -> R and N are repeated, so new: M, O, U.

 In ""SPURN"": S, P, U, R, N -> new: S, P, U.

 In ""RINDS"": R, I, N, D, S -> new: I, D, S.

 Which letters are more common?

 Among consonants: S, T, L, etc., vowels: O, U, I.

 Probably ""SPURN"" covers S, P (two consonants) and U (vowel). ""MOURN"" has M which is less common? But U and O are vowels.

 Since we haven't tested O, I, U, we might want to test one vowel? 

 Alternatively, to avoid potential duplication of letters? The secret word might not have duplicates, but we don't know.

 Actually, Wordle can have duplicate letters? However, the feedback might show duplicated feedback? But in Wordle, if a letter appears twice but the secret only has one, then the second one might show as yellow or gray? But we don't know yet.

 But our first guess had no duplicates, and we got two yellow letters (R and N). So the word has R and N exactly? Or maybe it has duplicates? But we don't know.

 To be safe, we should choose a word without duplicates if possible.

 Also, note that ""SPURN"" has letters S, P, U, R, N: all distinct? Yes.

 ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N: distinct.

 ""RINDS"": R,I,N,D,S: distinct.

 Now, which word gives us more information? Covering more common letters.

 I think ""SPURN"" might be better because it includes S which is very common. P is common but less than some others. U is a vowel.

 Compare to ""RINDS"": includes I (vowel) and D,S. 

 Another candidate: ""WORDS"": but has O, and S, but doesn't have N? Must have N.

 Because we know N is in the word. So words without N are invalid.

 We must use both R and N.

 I will go with ""SPURN"" as it covers S, P, U (new letters) and R, N (known) in new positions.

 So guess: SPURN

 Format our response.

 First, we do the reasoning above, then output.

 We say:
 <thinking>
 We have feedback from CRANE: C absent, R present but not in position 2, A absent, N present but not in position 4, E absent.
 Therefore, next guess must include R and N (placed in positions other than 2 and 4 respectively) and avoid C,A,E.
 We choose ""SPURN"": places R at position 4 (new) and N at position 5 (new). It introduces new letters S, P, U. It avoids the forbidden letters and positions.
 </thinking>
 Then: <guess>SPURN</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (C[x], R[-], A[x], N[-], E[x]), we know:
- R and N are in the secret word but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
- C, A, and E are absent from the word.

For the next guess:
- Must include R and N, placed in new positions (avoiding position 2 for R and position 4 for N).
- Avoid using C, A, E.
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.

After considering options like ""MOURN"" and ""RINDS"", ""SPURN"" was selected because:
- Positions: R at position 4 (≠2) and N at position 5 (≠4).
- Uses new letters: S, P, U (common consonants and a vowel).
- Valid 5-letter word meaning ""to reject disdainfully"".

<guess>SPURN</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPURN -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) U(x) R(-) N(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, A, E are absent from the word.
- R is present but not in position 2.
- N is present but not in position 4.

Guess 2: SPURN -> S(x) P(x) U(x) R(-) N(-)
Meaning:
- S, P, U are absent from the word.
- R is present but not in position 4 (since in SPURN, R is at position 4 and it's marked minus).
- N is present but not in position 5 (since in SPURN, N is at position 5 and it's marked minus).

Now, combining the information:

Absent letters: C, A, E, S, P, U. So we cannot use these.

Present letters: R and N (from both guesses).

We know R is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). So R must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 5.

Similarly, N is not in position 4 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess). So N must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 3.

But note: the word has 5 positions. We have two known letters: R and N, and we need to find the other three.

We also know that the word does not contain: C, A, E, S, P, U.

We need to choose a word that includes R and N, in positions that are allowed, and three new letters that are not in the absent list.

What letters are left? The alphabet minus absent letters: 
Absent: C, A, E, S, P, U. So available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, T, W, Y.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word with R and N, and three from the available letters.

Constraints on positions:
- R can be in positions 1, 3, 5.
- N can be in positions 1, 2, 3.

But note: if we put R and N in the same word, we have to assign positions without conflict.

Also, we must avoid the positions where they were previously misplaced.

Let's list possible positions for R and N:

For R: positions 1, 3, 5
For N: positions 1, 2, 3

But they cannot be in the same position? Actually, they are two different letters, so they can share a position? No, each position has one letter. So if R is at 1, then N cannot be at 1. Similarly, if R is at 3, then N cannot be at 3. And if R is at 5, then N can be at 1,2,3.

So possible combinations:

Case 1: R at 1 -> then N can be at 2 or 3 (since 1 is taken).
Case 2: R at 3 -> then N can be at 1 or 2 (since 3 is taken).
Case 3: R at 5 -> then N can be at 1, 2, or 3.

We need to choose a word that fits one of these and uses available letters.

We also want to cover new common letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that have R and N, and three other available letters.

Common patterns:

- Words ending with R? But R at 5 is possible.

- Words starting with R? Then R at 1.

- Words with R in the middle.

Let me brainstorm:

Option 1: R at position 1, N at position 2: e.g., R N _ _ _
But what letters? We need three letters from available. Example: ROUND? But U is absent. RINSE? But S and E absent. RINSE has S and E which are absent. Not allowed.

Option: R at 1, N at 3: R _ N _ _
Example: ROBIN? But O and B are available? ROBIN: R, O, B, I, N -> but that's 5 letters? R at 1, O at 2, B at 3? No: positions: 1-R, 2-O, 3-B, 4-I, 5-N? But we want N at position 3? Then it would be R _ N _ _ -> so if N is at 3, then positions: 1-R, 2-?, 3-N, 4-?, 5-?.

So for R at 1, N at 3: words like: R A N _ _ -> but A is absent. R E N _ _ -> E absent. R I N _ _ -> like RINSE? But S and E absent. RINKY? Not a word. RINDY? Not common.

Another: R _ N _ _ with available letters: e.g., R O N D O? But O repeated? And D and O available. ""RONDO"" is 5 letters? R at 1, O at 2, N at 3, D at 4, O at 5? But O repeated? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we can try. However, we have to avoid absent letters.

But ""RONDO"" has two O's? And O is available. But let's see: R at 1, O at 2, N at 3, D at 4, O at 5. But we have N at position 3? And R at 1. But in the feedback, we don't have any O or D tested yet. So it might be a candidate.

But is ""RONDO"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a musical form.

But we have two O's? The secret word might not have duplicates? But we don't know. It's acceptable to try.

But we have to consider other options.

Option: R at 1, N at 2: R N _ _ _
Words: RNZAA? Not valid. RNA? Not 5 letters. ROUND? U absent. RINSE? S and E absent. Not many common words.

How about R at 3? Then N at 1 or 2.

Case: R at 3, N at 1: N _ R _ _
Example: N O R M _ -> NORM? 4 letters. NORMAL? 6. N O R D S? But S absent. N O R I K? Not valid.

Case: R at 3, N at 2: _ N R _ _
Example: O N R E P? Not valid. B N R G? Not. Few words.

Case: R at 5, then N at 1,2, or 3.

Subcase: R at 5, N at 1: N _ _ _ R
Example: N _ _ _ R: like ""LONER"" but L, O, N, E, R -> E absent. ""TONER"" -> T, O, N, E, R -> E absent. ""DINER"" -> E absent. ""MINER"" -> E absent. Since E is absent, we cannot use words ending with ER? But we have R at the end.

We need words without E. So N _ _ _ R without E.

Example: ""MANOR"" -> M, A, N, O, R -> but A is absent. ""MINOR"" -> M, I, N, O, R -> but M, I, N, O, R: all available? Let's check: A absent? MINOR has no A, E, S, P, U, C. So M, I, N, O, R are all allowed.

But positions: N at 1? MINOR: M at 1, I at 2, N at 3, O at 4, R at 5. So R is at 5? That's allowed. N is at 3? But we have constraint: N cannot be at position 4 (from first guess) and not at 5 (from second guess), but position 3 is allowed. So N at 3 is okay.

But in MINOR, N is at position 3? Yes. And R at position 5? Yes.

But we also have to check if R and N are in new positions: 
- R: previously at position 2 (in CRANE) and 4 (in SPURN), now at 5: new position, good.
- N: previously at position 4 (in CRANE) and 5 (in SPURN), now at 3: new position, good.

So ""MINOR"" is a candidate.

Subcase: R at 5, N at 2: _ N _ _ R
Example: O N L Y R? Not a word. I N F O R? Not 5. B N T R? Not. ""ONCER""? Not valid. ""INKER""? E absent. ""ANKER""? A absent. Not many.

Subcase: R at 5, N at 3: _ _ N _ R
Example: B O N G R? Not. T O N G R? Not. ""LONER"" but E absent. ""TONER"" E absent. ""HONOR"" -> H, O, N, O, R: positions: 1-H, 2-O, 3-N, 4-O, 5-R. So N at 3? Allowed. R at 5? Allowed. And letters: H, O, N, O, R -> O repeated? But H and O available. ""HONOR"" is a valid word.

But we have two O's? It might be acceptable.

But we already have ""MINOR"" without duplicates? MINOR has no duplicates.

Another candidate: ""MINOR"" and ""HONOR"".

But ""MINOR"" uses M, I, O, N, R.

We also have the case R at 1, N at 3: we had ""RONDO"" as a candidate? But ""RONDO"" has two O's.

Now, to choose between these, we should pick one that covers new letters.

We have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

In ""MINOR"": M, I, O, N, R -> new letters: M, I, O (N and R are known).

In ""HONOR"": H, O, N, O, R -> new: H, O (and O repeated).

In ""RONDO"": R, O, N, D, O -> new: O, D (and O repeated).

We want to maximize new information. ""MINOR"" introduces three new letters: M, I, O. ""HONOR"" introduces two: H, O (and one duplicate). ""RONDO"" introduces two: O, D (and one duplicate). So ""MINOR"" is better.

But we must ensure that the positions are correct: in ""MINOR"", R is at 5 and N is at 3? Let's write it:

M I N O R
Positions: 1-M, 2-I, 3-N, 4-O, 5-R.

Now, constraints:
- R: must not be at 2 or 4 -> 5 is okay.
- N: must not be at 4 or 5 -> 3 is okay.

So it satisfies.

Is there a word with more common letters? We could try to include T or L, which are very common.

For example, R at 5, N at 1: N _ _ _ R without E. We had ""MINOR"" but that has N at 3? Not at 1.

What about N at 1 and R at 5: words like ""N__ _ R"": e.g., ""NADIR"" but A absent. ""NOMBR""? Not valid. ""NIGER""? E absent. ""NYMPH""? M, P? P is absent? P is absent from second guess. So no.

Another: ""NODER""? E absent.

So ""MINOR"" seems a good choice.

But let's check if there is a word with T? For example, ""MINTY""? But T and Y, but then R is missing? We must include R and N.

""MINOR"" has R and N.

Another candidate: ""TRIBE"" but E absent and B? But we need R and N. ""TRIBE"" has R but not N? So no.

""BRING"": B, R, I, N, G -> positions: 1-B, 2-R (but R cannot be at position 2! from first guess). So invalid.

""GRIND"": G, R, I, N, D -> R at position 2? Not allowed.

""DRINK"": D, R, I, N, K -> R at 2? Not allowed.

""PRINT"": P is absent.

So ""MINOR"" seems solid.

We could also consider ""ROBIN"", but in ""ROBIN"": R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, I at 4, N at 5. But N at 5? We know from second guess that N cannot be at position 5 (because in SPURN, N at 5 was minus). So N at 5 is disallowed. Therefore, ""ROBIN"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""ORBIN""? Not a word.

Another: ""RHINO"": R, H, I, N, O -> positions: 1-R, 2-H, 3-I, 4-N, 5-O. But N at position 4? We know from first guess that N cannot be at position 4 (CRANE had N at 4 and minus). So invalid.

Therefore, ""MINOR"" is a good candidate.

So I will go with ""MINOR"".

But let's confirm the letters: M, I, N, O, R. 
- M: not tested before -> new.
- I: not tested -> new.
- O: not tested -> new.
- N: known present.
- R: known present.

And positions: R at 5 (allowed), N at 3 (allowed).

So we can use this.

Therefore, the next guess is ""MINOR"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, A, E absent; R and N present but not in positions 2 and 4.
- **Guess 2 (SPURN)**: S, P, U absent; R and N present but not in positions 4 and 5.

### Key Insights:
- **Absent letters**: C, A, E, S, P, U (cannot be used).
- **Present letters**: R and N must be included.
- **Position constraints**:
  - R cannot be in position 2 (from CRANE) or 4 (from SPURN), so R must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
  - N cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE) or 5 (from SPURN), so N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (focus on common letters like M, I, O, T, L).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Must include R and N in valid positions (avoiding disallowed slots).
- Use new, common letters to maximize information (e.g., M, I, O).
- Avoid repeating positions for R and N from previous guesses.
- ""MINOR"" was chosen because:
  - Positions: R at 5 (allowed, not 2 or 4), N at 3 (allowed, not 4 or 5).
  - Letters: M, I, O are new and common; N and R are confirmed present.
  - Valid 5-letter word meaning ""lesser in importance"".
  - Tests three new letters (M, I, O) while respecting constraints.

<guess>MINOR</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPURN -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) U(x) R(-) N(-)
Guess 3: MINOR -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
  - Absent: C, A, E
  - Present but wrong position: R (not pos2), N (not pos4)

Guess 2: SPURN -> S(x) P(x) U(x) R(-) N(-)
  - Absent: S, P, U
  - Present but wrong position: R (not pos4), N (not pos5)

Guess 3: MINOR -> M(x) I(x) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)
  - Absent: M, I
  - Correct position: N at position 3, O at position 4, R at position 5

Now, from Guess 3, we have:
  - N is at position 3 (since it's correct, and in MINOR, N is at position 3)
  - O is at position 4 (correct)
  - R is at position 5 (correct)

So the secret word has:
  - Position 3: N
  - Position 4: O
  - Position 5: R

And we know from previous that R and N are present, which is consistent.

Now, we need to find the first two letters.

We also have a list of absent letters: C, A, E, S, P, U, M, I.

So absent: A, C, E, I, M, P, S, U.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: O and R and N are already placed, so we don't need to guess them again. We only need to guess positions 1 and 2.

The secret word pattern: _ _ N O R

We know the first two letters must be from the available letters, and not in the absent list.

We also have constraints from previous feedback about R and N positions, but now we have fixed their positions, so that is satisfied.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word of the form _ _ N O R.

What are possible words?

Common words ending with ""NOR"": like MINOR (but M and I are absent, and we already tried), so not.

Other words: 
  - ""TONOR""? Not a word.
  - ""DONOR"": D, O, N, O, R? But that would be D at 1, O at 2, N at 3, O at 4, R at 5? But we have O at 4? In DONOR, the positions are: 1-D, 2-O, 3-N, 4-O, 5-R? But we have O at position 4? That is correct, but we also have O at position 2? And we don't know if O can be duplicated? But in the feedback for MINOR, O was at position 4 and correct, but we don't have information about O at other positions.

However, in DONOR, there are two O's. But the secret word might have only one O? We don't know.

But let's see: the feedback for MINOR had O at position 4 correct, but it doesn't tell us about other O's. So it's possible that there is another O? But we have to consider.

But we also have the absent letters: we don't have O as absent, so it could be present multiple times? But we don't know.

To be safe, we should consider both possibilities.

But let's list possible words ending with NOR.

Common words: 
  - ""DONOR"": D, O, N, O, R -> positions: 1-D, 2-O, 3-N, 4-O, 5-R. But we have O at position 4? That is fixed. But in this word, position 2 is also O. Is that allowed? Yes, if the word has two O's.

But we need to check if D is available? D is not in absent list, so yes.

Another word: ""HONOR"": H, O, N, O, R -> same as above: 1-H, 2-O, 3-N, 4-O, 5-R. H is available.

But in ""HONOR"", we have O at position 2 and 4. We know position 4 is O, so position 2 being O is possible? Yes.

But we also have ""MINOR"" which we tried, but M and I are absent.

Another: ""TONOR"" not a word.

""JUNOR""? Not.

""LONOR""? Not.

""WONOR""? Not.

""BONOR""? Not.

""GONOR""? Not.

""CONOR""? But C is absent.

So the only common words I can think of are ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"".

But both have O at position 2? And we have O at position 4.

We also have ""TENOR"": T, E, N, O, R -> but E is absent (from first guess). So not allowed.

""VENOR""? Not a word.

""LENOR""? Not.

""RENOR""? Not.

""ZENOR""? Not.

So ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"" are the main candidates.

But we must consider: in ""DONOR"", the first letter is D and second is O. In ""HONOR"", first is H and second is O.

We need to guess one of these? But we don't know which.

We could also consider that the word might not have O at position 2? But what other words are there?

Another possibility: ""MANOR"" but M is absent and A is absent? ""MANOR"" has M and A, both absent.

""MINOR"" we tried.

""BONUS"" but S absent and U absent, and not ending with NOR.

We are fixed to _ _ N O R.

Perhaps ""FJORD""? But that's F, J, O, R, D -> positions: 1-F, 2-J, 3-O, 4-R, 5-D? But we need position 3 to be N, not O. So no.

All words must have N at position 3, O at 4, R at 5.

So the only common words are ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"".

But note: in ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"", the second letter is O. But we have O already at position 4. If the word has only one O, then having O at position 2 would be incorrect? But we don't know.

In the feedback for MINOR, we had O at position 4 correct, but if there were another O, it might have been indicated? In Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback can be tricky.

Recall: in MINOR, we had M(x) I(x) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓). The O was at position 4 and marked correct. If there were another O in the secret word, say at position 2, then in MINOR, we don't have a letter at position 2 that is O? MINOR has I at position 2, which is not O, so if the secret word had O at position 2, then for the O in MINOR at position 4, it would still be correct (green), but the absence of O at position 2 wouldn't be directly indicated because we didn't guess O there. However, if we had guessed a letter that is not O at a position where O is, it would be a yellow or something? But in MINOR, at position 2 we guessed I, which is not O, and if the secret word had O at position 2, then I should be marked as absent? But in the feedback, I is marked absent (x), meaning I is not in the word at all. So if the secret word had O at position 2, and we guessed I at position 2, then I would be marked as not present (x) only if I is not in the word, which is consistent. But it doesn't tell us about O at position 2.

Actually, the feedback for MINOR: I is marked x, meaning the letter I is not in the word. So the secret word does not contain I. Similarly, M is not in the word.

But for O: we have O at position 4 and it's correct, but if there is another O, we don't know because we didn't guess it elsewhere.

So it's possible that the secret word has another O? For example, in position 2.

Therefore, ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"" are possible.

But we need to choose one to guess.

We could also consider if there are words without O at position 2? But we couldn't think of any.

Another word: ""DINOR""? Not a word.

""KINOR""? Not.

""LINOR""? Not.

""WINOR""? Not.

""YONOR""? Not.

So it seems ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"" are the only common ones.

But let's check: ""DONOR"" is valid, ""HONOR"" is valid.

We can also consider ""FJORD"" but that doesn't have N at position 3.

Perhaps ""ANNOY"" but not ending with NOR.

I think we have to go with one of these.

But note: in ""DONOR"", the first letter is D, which is available. In ""HONOR"", first letter is H, available.

We don't have any information about D or H.

We could guess one of them and see.

But we have only 3 guesses left? We are on the fourth guess? Let me count: we had guess 1,2,3, so this is guess 4.

We can try to guess a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained to _ _ N O R, so we have to fill the first two positions.

We could guess ""DONOR"" to test D and the double O? Or ""HONOR"" for H.

But we might also consider that the word might not have a vowel at position 2? But in ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"", position 2 is O, a vowel.

Is there a word with a consonant at position 2? For example, ""BONOR"" not a word. ""GONOR"" not. ""KNOTS"" not.

Another idea: ""SNORE"" but S and E absent.

""STORE"" E absent.

So I think we have to choose between ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"".

But let's see the definition: both are valid.

Perhaps we can use a word that has different letters to get more information? But we are forced to have N, O, R at the end, so the first two letters are the only unknowns.

If we guess ""DONOR"", and it's wrong, we get feedback on D and the second O.

Similarly for ""HONOR"".

But we might run out of guesses? We have 3 guesses left? Actually, Wordle has 6 guesses total, we used 3, so 3 left.

We can also consider that the secret word might be ""MINOR"" but we know M and I are absent, so it can't be.

Another word: ""MANOR"" but M and A absent.

""LONER"" but E absent and L? But LONER has E.

""TONER"" E absent.

""CONOR"" C absent.

So I think ""DONOR"" or ""HONOR"" are the only options.

But let's check if there is a word like ""DONOR"" but without the second O? No, because it must end with NOR.

Perhaps ""DINAR"" but not NOR.

I think we have to pick one.

Let me choose ""HONOR"" because H is a common consonant.

But in ""HONOR"", the first letter is H, second is O.

We know O is at position 4, so if we guess ""HONOR"", and if the secret word is ""HONOR"", then we win.

If it's ""DONOR"", then we get feedback that H is absent? But H is at position 1, and if it's not H, then we know it must be D? Because only two options.

Similarly, if we guess ""DONOR"" and it's not, then we know it must be ""HONOR"".

So we can do that.

But we have to be careful: what if there is another word? For example, ""XENON"" but not ending with R.

I think for now, we'll assume it's one of these two.

So I'll guess ""HONOR"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""HONOR"":
  - Position 1: H -> if the secret word is ""HONOR"", then H is correct (✓). If it's ""DONOR"", then H is absent (x) because D is there.
  - Position 2: O -> in both cases, if the secret word has O at position 2? But in ""DONOR"", position 2 is O, so if we guess O at position 2, and it is present, it should be yellow or green? But in ""DONOR"", O is at position 2 and 4. If we guess O at position 2, and the secret word is ""DONOR"", then since position 2 is O, it would be green? But we don't know if the secret word has O at position 2.

In ""HONOR"", we have O at position 2 and 4.

In ""DONOR"", we have O at position 2 and 4.

So both have O at position 2 and 4.

Therefore, if we guess ""HONOR"", then:
  - Position 1: H -> if secret is ""HONOR"", ✓; if ""DONOR"", then H is absent (x) because ""DONOR"" has D at 1, not H.
  - Position 2: O -> in both cases, O is at position 2 in the secret? Yes, both words have O at 2, so it should be green (✓) for both.
  - Position 3: N -> green (✓) for both.
  - Position 4: O -> green (✓) for both.
  - Position 5: R -> green (✓) for both.

So the feedback for ""HONOR"" would be:
  - If secret is ""HONOR"": H(✓) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓) -> all correct.
  - If secret is ""DONOR"": H(x) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓) -> because H is absent, but O at position 2 is correct.

Similarly, if we guess ""DONOR"":
  - If secret is ""DONOR"": all ✓.
  - If secret is ""HONOR"": D(x) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓).

So in either case, we can distinguish.

But we don't know if the secret word is one of these.

But let's assume it is.

So I'll guess ""HONOR"".

But is there a possibility of another word? For example, ""OCTOR""? Not a word.

""ACTOR"" but A and C absent.

So I think it's safe.

Therefore, we guess ""HONOR"".

But note: in the feedback for MINOR, we had O at position 4 correct, but we didn't have O at position 2. So if the secret word has O at position 2, we don't know. But in ""HONOR"", we are guessing O at position 2, so we'll find out.

But we must consider that the secret word might not have O at position 2? But we couldn't find any other word.

Another word: ""JUNOR"" not.

""VOTOR""? Not.

I think we have to go with it.

So guess: HONOR

But let's output.### Analysis of Feedback and Current State

After three guesses, we have the following information:

1. **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
   - C (absent), R (present but not position 2), A (absent), N (present but not position 4), E (absent).
   - **Absent letters**: C, A, E.
   - **Present letters**: R, N (with position constraints).

2. **Guess 2 (SPURN)**:
   - S (absent), P (absent), U (absent), R (present but not position 4), N (present but not position 5).
   - **New absent letters**: S, P, U.
   - **Updated position constraints for R and N**: R cannot be in position 2 or 4; N cannot be in position 4 or 5.

3. **Guess 3 (MINOR)**:
   - M (absent), I (absent), N (correct position, position 3), O (correct position, position 4), R (correct position, position 5).
   - **New absent letters**: M, I.
   - **Confirmed positions**: 
     - Position 3: N
     - Position 4: O
     - Position 5: R

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word structure**: The word must be `_ _ N O R` (positions 3, 4, and 5 are fixed as N, O, R).
- **Absent letters (cannot use)**: A, C, E, I, M, P, S, U (8 letters).
- **Available letters for positions 1 and 2**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (focus on common letters like D, H, L, T).
- **Position constraints for R and N are satisfied** (R at 5, N at 3).
- **O is confirmed at position 4**, but it may appear elsewhere (e.g., position 2) since we haven't tested other positions for O.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We need to guess a valid 5-letter word of the form `_ _ N O R`.
- Common English words fitting this pattern:
  - **HONOR**: Positions: H (1), O (2), N (3), O (4), R (5).
  - **DONOR**: Positions: D (1), O (2), N (3), O (4), R (5).
- Both words are valid and use available letters. No other common words fit the pattern (e.g., ""TONOR"" is invalid, ""MINOR"" is ruled out due to M and I being absent).
- **Why choose ""HONOR""?**
  - It tests H (a common consonant) and the possibility of O at position 2.
  - Feedback will be decisive:
    - If ""HONOR"" is correct, all positions will be green (✓).
    - If incorrect (e.g., secret is ""DONOR""), feedback will show H as absent (x) and O at position 2 as correct (✓), narrowing it to ""DONOR"" for the next guess.
- We have 3 guesses remaining, so this is a safe, information-maximizing choice.

Actually, in the feedback, we say position of R is 2? Let\'s index from 1: position 1=C, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=E).\n\n But note: the secret word has R, but not at position 2, and has N, but not at position 4. Also, the letters C, A, and E are absent.\n\n Now, we know that R and N are in the word, so we must include them in our next guess. And avoid C, A, E.\n\n Also, we have 5 positions to guess. We need to choose a word with R and N, but not C, A, E.\n\n Additionally, R cannot be in position 2 and N cannot be in position 4.\n\n Let\'s think of words that include R and N, and try to cover new common letters.\n\n What are other common letters? We can try to use vowels that haven\'t been checked. We didn\'t check O, U, I, etc. And consonants like T, L, S, D, etc.\n\n Our new guess should have R and N, put them in different positions than before (so R not at spot 2, N not at spot 4), and include three new letters that are possible.\n\n We also want to avoid A and E (since absent) and C (absent).\n\n Possible candidate: ""R"" must be somewhere else, say positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: if we put R at position 1, that might be a possibility. Similarly for N, we can put it at positions 1,2,3,5? (but in guess we can try any position).\n\n However, we must use valid English words.\n\n Let me brainstorm words with R and N, and excluding A, E, C.\n\n Examples:\n   - ""HORNS"": H, O, R, N, S -> but we have O which is a new vowel, and S common.\n   - ""BORNS"": not valid word? Actually, borns is not common, but ""barns"" has A which is excluded.\n   - ""PORNS"": that might be sensitive and probably not suitable? Avoid.\n   - ""WORNS"": not valid? Perhaps ""worn"" is base, but we need 5 letters.\n\n   - Another: ""DARN"" but that\'s 4 letters. We need 5.\n\n   - ""TORN"": only 4 letters.\n\n   - ""RUNTY"": but has Y and T, and 5 letters? Actually, ""runty"" is an adjective meaning small and weak, valid.\n\n   However, we don\'t have many letters covered. Let\'s try to include another vowel?\n\n   Since A and E are out, we can try I, O, U.\n\n Let me think: ""PRINT"": P, R, I, N, T -> has R and N? R at position 2? But in our first guess R was at pos2 and it was minus meaning not there. So in ""PRINT"", R is at pos2? We cannot put R at position 2. So ""PRINT"" would put R again at the same position which is bad because we know R is not at position 2.\n\n We must avoid putting R at position 2.\n\n Similarly, avoid N at position 4.\n\n So ""PRINT"" is not good then? But if we change the position: let\'s see if we can move R elsewhere.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROUND"": R, O, U, N, D -> R is at position 1? Then N is at position 4? But we cannot put N at position 4 because that was the position where we had N and it was minus, meaning N is in the word but not at position 4.\n\n So if we put N at position 4 in this guess, it would be invalid because we know it\'s not there. Therefore, we must avoid that.\n\n Therefore, in ""ROUND"": \n   position 1: R -> R cannot be at position 1? No, we don\'t know about position 1 yet. Only that R cannot be at position 2 (from previous guess). So putting R at 1 is okay? But wait: when we had CRANE, R was at position 2 and got minus. So R must be at a position other than 2. Similarly, N must be at a position other than 4.\n\n ""ROUND"" has R at position 1 (which is new) and N at position 4? Not allowed because from the first guess, N was at position 4 and marked minus meaning it cannot be at position 4. So ""ROUND"" would have N at position 4 again? That would be bad.\n\n Therefore, skip ""ROUND"".\n\n What about ""SPURN"": S, P, U, R, N -> positions: 1-S,2-P,3-U,4-R,5-N? \n   Then R is at position 4 -> which is different than position 2? Yes. And N is at position 5 -> different from position 4? Yes. \n   So this would be acceptable.\n\n Is ""spurn"" a word? Yes: verb meaning to reject with disdain.\n\n Also, we introduce new letters: S, P, U, and we already know R and N.\n\n But note: we excluded C, A, E. S and P are common consonants, U is a vowel.\n\n So let\'s consider:\n\n   Previous absent letters: C, A, E -> so S, P, U are not C,A,E -> acceptable.\n\n   Now, we are also avoiding putting R at the wrong position? Yes: we have R at position 4 which is new.\n\n   And N at position 5 (new).\n\n So ""SPURN"" seems good.\n\n Another option: ""BURNS"": B,U,R,N,S -> positions: 1-B,2-U,3-R,4-N,5-S. \n   But then N is at position 4? But our first guess had N at position 4 and it was marked minus, meaning N cannot be at position 4. So we must avoid? Yes.\n\n Therefore, ""BURNS"" is invalid because it puts N at position 4.\n\n Similarly, ""GRIND"": G,R,I,N,D -> Positions: 1-G,2-R (we know R cannot be at position 2, so no), 3-I,4-N (but we know N cannot be at position 4). So avoid.\n\n How about ""GRUNT"": G,R,U,N,T -> positions: 1-G,2-R (cannot put R at 2 -> not allowed). So skip.\n\n Another: ""DRUNK"": D,R,U,N,K -> but R is at position 2? Avoid.\n\n ""URN"" related words? ""URINE"": U,R,I,N,E -> but E cannot be used because it\'s absent? No, the first feedback said E(x) meaning E is absent. So we cannot use E.\n\n So avoid ""URINE"".\n\n How about ""TRUNK"": T,R,U,N,K -> but R at position 2? Not allowed.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s put R in positions other than 2: either 1,3,4,5.\n\n Similarly, N in positions other than 4: 1,2,3,5.\n\n Consider ""PRUNS"": not common, maybe prune without e? Not valid.\n\n Another: ""ROUNDS"": 6 letters? No.\n\n A better one: ""SYRUP"": only 5 letters? Yes, but doesn\'t have N? Wait, we must include N because we know N is in the word.\n\n We cannot omit N because we must confirm where it is. Similarly for R.\n\n So we must include both R and N.\n\n Let\'s try ""RINDS"": R,I,N,D,S -> positions: 1-R, 2-I, 3-N (so N at position 3? That\'s new), 4-D,5-S. Now, R is at position 1 (not 2) -> okay. N at position 3 (not 4) -> okay. And letters: don\'t use C,A,E -> good.\n\n But we have R at position 1. Is that allowed? Yes, because the only constraint is R not at 2, so it could be at 1.\n\n Also, ""rinds"" is a word (e.g., orange rinds).\n\n Alternatively, ""NURSE"": N,U,R,S,E -> but E is absent (first feedback E marked x) so we cannot use E.\n\n Another: ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N -> positions: 1-M, 2-O, 3-U, 4-R, 5-N -> this is interesting: \n   R is at position 4 (not 2), N at position 5 (not 4) -> okay. \n   Letters: M, O, U, R, N -> no C,A,E -> valid.\n\n Is ""mourn"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n How about ""SPIRN"": not a word. Or ""HORNY"": H,O,R,N,Y -> positions: 1-H,2-O,3-R (R at position 3 -> not 2),4-N (but we cannot put N at position 4) -> skip because N at 4 is disallowed.\n\n Wait, in ""HORNY"", N is at position 4? Which is forbidden.\n\n So avoid.\n\n Now between ""MOURN"" and ""SPURN"", both seem valid? I also thought of ""RINDS"".\n\n Let me check if ""MOURN"" is 5 letters: yes. ""SPURN"": yes. ""RINDS"": yes.\n\n Which one to choose? We want to cover new letters. \n\n First guess letters: C,R,A,N,E -> we have used R and N. \n\n For second guess, we want to cover letters that are not tested: in ""MOURN"": we cover M, O, U, R, N -> R and N are repeated, so new: M, O, U.\n\n In ""SPURN"": S, P, U, R, N -> new: S, P, U.\n\n In ""RINDS"": R, I, N, D, S -> new: I, D, S.\n\n Which letters are more common?\n\n Among consonants: S, T, L, etc., vowels: O, U, I.\n\n Probably ""SPURN"" covers S, P (two consonants) and U (vowel). ""MOURN"" has M which is less common? But U and O are vowels.\n\n Since we haven\'t tested O, I, U, we might want to test one vowel? \n\n Alternatively, to avoid potential duplication of letters? The secret word might not have duplicates, but we don\'t know.\n\n Actually, Wordle can have duplicate letters? However, the feedback might show duplicated feedback? But in Wordle, if a letter appears twice but the secret only has one, then the second one might show as yellow or gray? But we don\'t know yet.\n\n But our first guess had no duplicates, and we got two yellow letters (R and N). So the word has R and N exactly? Or maybe it has duplicates? But we don\'t know.\n\n To be safe, we should choose a word without duplicates if possible.\n\n Also, note that ""SPURN"" has letters S, P, U, R, N: all distinct? Yes.\n\n ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N: distinct.\n\n ""RINDS"": R,I,N,D,S: distinct.\n\n Now, which word gives us more information? Covering more common letters.\n\n I think ""SPURN"" might be better because it includes S which is very common. P is common but less than some others. U is a vowel.\n\n Compare to ""RINDS"": includes I (vowel) and D,S. \n\n Another candidate: ""WORDS"": but has O, and S, but doesn\'t have N? Must have N.\n\n Because we know N is in the word. So words without N are invalid.\n\n We must use both R and N.\n\n I will go with ""SPURN"" as it covers S, P, U (new letters) and R, N (known) in new positions.\n\n So guess: SPURN\n\n Format our response.\n\n First, we do the reasoning above, then output.\n\n We say:\n <thinking>\n We have feedback from CRANE: C absent, R present but not in position 2, A absent, N present but not in position 4, E absent.\n Therefore, next guess must include R and N (placed in positions other than 2 and 4 respectively) and avoid C,A,E.\n We choose ""SPURN"": places R at position 4 (new) and N at position 5 (new). It introduces new letters S, P, U. It avoids the forbidden letters and positions.\n </thinking>\n Then: <guess>SPURN</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (C[x], R[-], A[x], N[-], E[x]), we know:\n- R and N are in the secret word but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.\n- C, A, and E are absent from the word.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include R and N, placed in new positions (avoiding position 2 for R and position 4 for N).\n- Avoid using C, A, E.\n- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.\n\nAfter considering options like ""MOURN"" and ""RINDS"", ""SPURN"" was selected because:\n- Positions: R at position 4 (≠2) and N at position 5 (≠4).\n- Uses new letters: S, P, U (common consonants and a vowel).\n- Valid 5-letter word meaning ""to reject disdainfully"".\n\n<guess>SPURN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPURN -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) U(x) R(-) N(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nMeaning:\n- C, A, E are absent from the word.\n- R is present but not in position 2.\n- N is present but not in position 4.\n\nGuess 2: SPURN -> S(x) P(x) U(x) R(-) N(-)\nMeaning:\n- S, P, U are absent from the word.\n- R is present but not in position 4 (since in SPURN, R is at position 4 and it\'s marked minus).\n- N is present but not in position 5 (since in SPURN, N is at position 5 and it\'s marked minus).\n\nNow, combining the information:\n\nAbsent letters: C, A, E, S, P, U. So we cannot use these.\n\nPresent letters: R and N (from both guesses).\n\nWe know R is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). So R must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, N is not in position 4 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess). So N must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 3.\n\nBut note: the word has 5 positions. We have two known letters: R and N, and we need to find the other three.\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain: C, A, E, S, P, U.\n\nWe need to choose a word that includes R and N, in positions that are allowed, and three new letters that are not in the absent list.\n\nWhat letters are left? The alphabet minus absent letters: \nAbsent: C, A, E, S, P, U. So available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we should focus on common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, T, W, Y.\n\nNow, we need to form a 5-letter word with R and N, and three from the available letters.\n\nConstraints on positions:\n- R can be in positions 1, 3, 5.\n- N can be in positions 1, 2, 3.\n\nBut note: if we put R and N in the same word, we have to assign positions without conflict.\n\nAlso, we must avoid the positions where they were previously misplaced.\n\nLet\'s list possible positions for R and N:\n\nFor R: positions 1, 3, 5\nFor N: positions 1, 2, 3\n\nBut they cannot be in the same position? Actually, they are two different letters, so they can share a position? No, each position has one letter. So if R is at 1, then N cannot be at 1. Similarly, if R is at 3, then N cannot be at 3. And if R is at 5, then N can be at 1,2,3.\n\nSo possible combinations:\n\nCase 1: R at 1 -> then N can be at 2 or 3 (since 1 is taken).\nCase 2: R at 3 -> then N can be at 1 or 2 (since 3 is taken).\nCase 3: R at 5 -> then N can be at 1, 2, or 3.\n\nWe need to choose a word that fits one of these and uses available letters.\n\nWe also want to cover new common letters to get more information.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have R and N, and three other available letters.\n\nCommon patterns:\n\n- Words ending with R? But R at 5 is possible.\n\n- Words starting with R? Then R at 1.\n\n- Words with R in the middle.\n\nLet me brainstorm:\n\nOption 1: R at position 1, N at position 2: e.g., R N _ _ _\nBut what letters? We need three letters from available. Example: ROUND? But U is absent. RINSE? But S and E absent. RINSE has S and E which are absent. Not allowed.\n\nOption: R at 1, N at 3: R _ N _ _\nExample: ROBIN? But O and B are available? ROBIN: R, O, B, I, N -> but that\'s 5 letters? R at 1, O at 2, B at 3? No: positions: 1-R, 2-O, 3-B, 4-I, 5-N? But we want N at position 3? Then it would be R _ N _ _ -> so if N is at 3, then positions: 1-R, 2-?, 3-N, 4-?, 5-?.\n\nSo for R at 1, N at 3: words like: R A N _ _ -> but A is absent. R E N _ _ -> E absent. R I N _ _ -> like RINSE? But S and E absent. RINKY? Not a word. RINDY? Not common.\n\nAnother: R _ N _ _ with available letters: e.g., R O N D O? But O repeated? And D and O available. ""RONDO"" is 5 letters? R at 1, O at 2, N at 3, D at 4, O at 5? But O repeated? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But we can try. However, we have to avoid absent letters.\n\nBut ""RONDO"" has two O\'s? And O is available. But let\'s see: R at 1, O at 2, N at 3, D at 4, O at 5. But we have N at position 3? And R at 1. But in the feedback, we don\'t have any O or D tested yet. So it might be a candidate.\n\nBut is ""RONDO"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a musical form.\n\nBut we have two O\'s? The secret word might not have duplicates? But we don\'t know. It\'s acceptable to try.\n\nBut we have to consider other options.\n\nOption: R at 1, N at 2: R N _ _ _\nWords: RNZAA? Not valid. RNA? Not 5 letters. ROUND? U absent. RINSE? S and E absent. Not many common words.\n\nHow about R at 3? Then N at 1 or 2.\n\nCase: R at 3, N at 1: N _ R _ _\nExample: N O R M _ -> NORM? 4 letters. NORMAL? 6. N O R D S? But S absent. N O R I K? Not valid.\n\nCase: R at 3, N at 2: _ N R _ _\nExample: O N R E P? Not valid. B N R G? Not. Few words.\n\nCase: R at 5, then N at 1,2, or 3.\n\nSubcase: R at 5, N at 1: N _ _ _ R\nExample: N _ _ _ R: like ""LONER"" but L, O, N, E, R -> E absent. ""TONER"" -> T, O, N, E, R -> E absent. ""DINER"" -> E absent. ""MINER"" -> E absent. Since E is absent, we cannot use words ending with ER? But we have R at the end.\n\nWe need words without E. So N _ _ _ R without E.\n\nExample: ""MANOR"" -> M, A, N, O, R -> but A is absent. ""MINOR"" -> M, I, N, O, R -> but M, I, N, O, R: all available? Let\'s check: A absent? MINOR has no A, E, S, P, U, C. So M, I, N, O, R are all allowed.\n\nBut positions: N at 1? MINOR: M at 1, I at 2, N at 3, O at 4, R at 5. So R is at 5? That\'s allowed. N is at 3? But we have constraint: N cannot be at position 4 (from first guess) and not at 5 (from second guess), but position 3 is allowed. So N at 3 is okay.\n\nBut in MINOR, N is at position 3? Yes. And R at position 5? Yes.\n\nBut we also have to check if R and N are in new positions: \n- R: previously at position 2 (in CRANE) and 4 (in SPURN), now at 5: new position, good.\n- N: previously at position 4 (in CRANE) and 5 (in SPURN), now at 3: new position, good.\n\nSo ""MINOR"" is a candidate.\n\nSubcase: R at 5, N at 2: _ N _ _ R\nExample: O N L Y R? Not a word. I N F O R? Not 5. B N T R? Not. ""ONCER""? Not valid. ""INKER""? E absent. ""ANKER""? A absent. Not many.\n\nSubcase: R at 5, N at 3: _ _ N _ R\nExample: B O N G R? Not. T O N G R? Not. ""LONER"" but E absent. ""TONER"" E absent. ""HONOR"" -> H, O, N, O, R: positions: 1-H, 2-O, 3-N, 4-O, 5-R. So N at 3? Allowed. R at 5? Allowed. And letters: H, O, N, O, R -> O repeated? But H and O available. ""HONOR"" is a valid word.\n\nBut we have two O\'s? It might be acceptable.\n\nBut we already have ""MINOR"" without duplicates? MINOR has no duplicates.\n\nAnother candidate: ""MINOR"" and ""HONOR"".\n\nBut ""MINOR"" uses M, I, O, N, R.\n\nWe also have the case R at 1, N at 3: we had ""RONDO"" as a candidate? But ""RONDO"" has two O\'s.\n\nNow, to choose between these, we should pick one that covers new letters.\n\nWe have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nIn ""MINOR"": M, I, O, N, R -> new letters: M, I, O (N and R are known).\n\nIn ""HONOR"": H, O, N, O, R -> new: H, O (and O repeated).\n\nIn ""RONDO"": R, O, N, D, O -> new: O, D (and O repeated).\n\nWe want to maximize new information. ""MINOR"" introduces three new letters: M, I, O. ""HONOR"" introduces two: H, O (and one duplicate). ""RONDO"" introduces two: O, D (and one duplicate). So ""MINOR"" is better.\n\nBut we must ensure that the positions are correct: in ""MINOR"", R is at 5 and N is at 3? Let\'s write it:\n\nM I N O R\nPositions: 1-M, 2-I, 3-N, 4-O, 5-R.\n\nNow, constraints:\n- R: must not be at 2 or 4 -> 5 is okay.\n- N: must not be at 4 or 5 -> 3 is okay.\n\nSo it satisfies.\n\nIs there a word with more common letters? We could try to include T or L, which are very common.\n\nFor example, R at 5, N at 1: N _ _ _ R without E. We had ""MINOR"" but that has N at 3? Not at 1.\n\nWhat about N at 1 and R at 5: words like ""N__ _ R"": e.g., ""NADIR"" but A absent. ""NOMBR""? Not valid. ""NIGER""? E absent. ""NYMPH""? M, P? P is absent? P is absent from second guess. So no.\n\nAnother: ""NODER""? E absent.\n\nSo ""MINOR"" seems a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s check if there is a word with T? For example, ""MINTY""? But T and Y, but then R is missing? We must include R and N.\n\n""MINOR"" has R and N.\n\nAnother candidate: ""TRIBE"" but E absent and B? But we need R and N. ""TRIBE"" has R but not N? So no.\n\n""BRING"": B, R, I, N, G -> positions: 1-B, 2-R (but R cannot be at position 2! from first guess). So invalid.\n\n""GRIND"": G, R, I, N, D -> R at position 2? Not allowed.\n\n""DRINK"": D, R, I, N, K -> R at 2? Not allowed.\n\n""PRINT"": P is absent.\n\nSo ""MINOR"" seems solid.\n\nWe could also consider ""ROBIN"", but in ""ROBIN"": R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, I at 4, N at 5. But N at 5? We know from second guess that N cannot be at position 5 (because in SPURN, N at 5 was minus). So N at 5 is disallowed. Therefore, ""ROBIN"" is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""ORBIN""? Not a word.\n\nAnother: ""RHINO"": R, H, I, N, O -> positions: 1-R, 2-H, 3-I, 4-N, 5-O. But N at position 4? We know from first guess that N cannot be at position 4 (CRANE had N at 4 and minus). So invalid.\n\nTherefore, ""MINOR"" is a good candidate.\n\nSo I will go with ""MINOR"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters: M, I, N, O, R. \n- M: not tested before -> new.\n- I: not tested -> new.\n- O: not tested -> new.\n- N: known present.\n- R: known present.\n\nAnd positions: R at 5 (allowed), N at 3 (allowed).\n\nSo we can use this.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""MINOR"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, A, E absent; R and N present but not in positions 2 and 4.\n- **Guess 2 (SPURN)**: S, P, U absent; R and N present but not in positions 4 and 5.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Absent letters**: C, A, E, S, P, U (cannot be used).\n- **Present letters**: R and N must be included.\n- **Position constraints**:\n  - R cannot be in position 2 (from CRANE) or 4 (from SPURN), so R must be in position 1, 3, or 5.\n  - N cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE) or 5 (from SPURN), so N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (focus on common letters like M, I, O, T, L).\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Must include R and N in valid positions (avoiding disallowed slots).\n- Use new, common letters to maximize information (e.g., M, I, O).\n- Avoid repeating positions for R and N from previous guesses.\n- ""MINOR"" was chosen because:\n  - Positions: R at 5 (allowed, not 2 or 4), N at 3 (allowed, not 4 or 5).\n  - Letters: M, I, O are new and common; N and R are confirmed present.\n  - Valid 5-letter word meaning ""lesser in importance"".\n  - Tests three new letters (M, I, O) while respecting constraints.\n\n<guess>MINOR</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPURN -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) U(x) R(-) N(-)\nGuess 3: MINOR -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)\n  - Absent: C, A, E\n  - Present but wrong position: R (not pos2), N (not pos4)\n\nGuess 2: SPURN -> S(x) P(x) U(x) R(-) N(-)\n  - Absent: S, P, U\n  - Present but wrong position: R (not pos4), N (not pos5)\n\nGuess 3: MINOR -> M(x) I(x) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)\n  - Absent: M, I\n  - Correct position: N at position 3, O at position 4, R at position 5\n\nNow, from Guess 3, we have:\n  - N is at position 3 (since it\'s correct, and in MINOR, N is at position 3)\n  - O is at position 4 (correct)\n  - R is at position 5 (correct)\n\nSo the secret word has:\n  - Position 3: N\n  - Position 4: O\n  - Position 5: R\n\nAnd we know from previous that R and N are present, which is consistent.\n\nNow, we need to find the first two letters.\n\nWe also have a list of absent letters: C, A, E, S, P, U, M, I.\n\nSo absent: A, C, E, I, M, P, S, U.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: O and R and N are already placed, so we don\'t need to guess them again. We only need to guess positions 1 and 2.\n\nThe secret word pattern: _ _ N O R\n\nWe know the first two letters must be from the available letters, and not in the absent list.\n\nWe also have constraints from previous feedback about R and N positions, but now we have fixed their positions, so that is satisfied.\n\nNow, we need to form a 5-letter word of the form _ _ N O R.\n\nWhat are possible words?\n\nCommon words ending with ""NOR"": like MINOR (but M and I are absent, and we already tried), so not.\n\nOther words: \n  - ""TONOR""? Not a word.\n  - ""DONOR"": D, O, N, O, R? But that would be D at 1, O at 2, N at 3, O at 4, R at 5? But we have O at 4? In DONOR, the positions are: 1-D, 2-O, 3-N, 4-O, 5-R? But we have O at position 4? That is correct, but we also have O at position 2? And we don\'t know if O can be duplicated? But in the feedback for MINOR, O was at position 4 and correct, but we don\'t have information about O at other positions.\n\nHowever, in DONOR, there are two O\'s. But the secret word might have only one O? We don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s see: the feedback for MINOR had O at position 4 correct, but it doesn\'t tell us about other O\'s. So it\'s possible that there is another O? But we have to consider.\n\nBut we also have the absent letters: we don\'t have O as absent, so it could be present multiple times? But we don\'t know.\n\nTo be safe, we should consider both possibilities.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words ending with NOR.\n\nCommon words: \n  - ""DONOR"": D, O, N, O, R -> positions: 1-D, 2-O, 3-N, 4-O, 5-R. But we have O at position 4? That is fixed. But in this word, position 2 is also O. Is that allowed? Yes, if the word has two O\'s.\n\nBut we need to check if D is available? D is not in absent list, so yes.\n\nAnother word: ""HONOR"": H, O, N, O, R -> same as above: 1-H, 2-O, 3-N, 4-O, 5-R. H is available.\n\nBut in ""HONOR"", we have O at position 2 and 4. We know position 4 is O, so position 2 being O is possible? Yes.\n\nBut we also have ""MINOR"" which we tried, but M and I are absent.\n\nAnother: ""TONOR"" not a word.\n\n""JUNOR""? Not.\n\n""LONOR""? Not.\n\n""WONOR""? Not.\n\n""BONOR""? Not.\n\n""GONOR""? Not.\n\n""CONOR""? But C is absent.\n\nSo the only common words I can think of are ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"".\n\nBut both have O at position 2? And we have O at position 4.\n\nWe also have ""TENOR"": T, E, N, O, R -> but E is absent (from first guess). So not allowed.\n\n""VENOR""? Not a word.\n\n""LENOR""? Not.\n\n""RENOR""? Not.\n\n""ZENOR""? Not.\n\nSo ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"" are the main candidates.\n\nBut we must consider: in ""DONOR"", the first letter is D and second is O. In ""HONOR"", first is H and second is O.\n\nWe need to guess one of these? But we don\'t know which.\n\nWe could also consider that the word might not have O at position 2? But what other words are there?\n\nAnother possibility: ""MANOR"" but M is absent and A is absent? ""MANOR"" has M and A, both absent.\n\n""MINOR"" we tried.\n\n""BONUS"" but S absent and U absent, and not ending with NOR.\n\nWe are fixed to _ _ N O R.\n\nPerhaps ""FJORD""? But that\'s F, J, O, R, D -> positions: 1-F, 2-J, 3-O, 4-R, 5-D? But we need position 3 to be N, not O. So no.\n\nAll words must have N at position 3, O at 4, R at 5.\n\nSo the only common words are ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"".\n\nBut note: in ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"", the second letter is O. But we have O already at position 4. If the word has only one O, then having O at position 2 would be incorrect? But we don\'t know.\n\nIn the feedback for MINOR, we had O at position 4 correct, but if there were another O, it might have been indicated? In Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback can be tricky.\n\nRecall: in MINOR, we had M(x) I(x) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓). The O was at position 4 and marked correct. If there were another O in the secret word, say at position 2, then in MINOR, we don\'t have a letter at position 2 that is O? MINOR has I at position 2, which is not O, so if the secret word had O at position 2, then for the O in MINOR at position 4, it would still be correct (green), but the absence of O at position 2 wouldn\'t be directly indicated because we didn\'t guess O there. However, if we had guessed a letter that is not O at a position where O is, it would be a yellow or something? But in MINOR, at position 2 we guessed I, which is not O, and if the secret word had O at position 2, then I should be marked as absent? But in the feedback, I is marked absent (x), meaning I is not in the word at all. So if the secret word had O at position 2, and we guessed I at position 2, then I would be marked as not present (x) only if I is not in the word, which is consistent. But it doesn\'t tell us about O at position 2.\n\nActually, the feedback for MINOR: I is marked x, meaning the letter I is not in the word. So the secret word does not contain I. Similarly, M is not in the word.\n\nBut for O: we have O at position 4 and it\'s correct, but if there is another O, we don\'t know because we didn\'t guess it elsewhere.\n\nSo it\'s possible that the secret word has another O? For example, in position 2.\n\nTherefore, ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"" are possible.\n\nBut we need to choose one to guess.\n\nWe could also consider if there are words without O at position 2? But we couldn\'t think of any.\n\nAnother word: ""DINOR""? Not a word.\n\n""KINOR""? Not.\n\n""LINOR""? Not.\n\n""WINOR""? Not.\n\n""YONOR""? Not.\n\nSo it seems ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"" are the only common ones.\n\nBut let\'s check: ""DONOR"" is valid, ""HONOR"" is valid.\n\nWe can also consider ""FJORD"" but that doesn\'t have N at position 3.\n\nPerhaps ""ANNOY"" but not ending with NOR.\n\nI think we have to go with one of these.\n\nBut note: in ""DONOR"", the first letter is D, which is available. In ""HONOR"", first letter is H, available.\n\nWe don\'t have any information about D or H.\n\nWe could guess one of them and see.\n\nBut we have only 3 guesses left? We are on the fourth guess? Let me count: we had guess 1,2,3, so this is guess 4.\n\nWe can try to guess a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained to _ _ N O R, so we have to fill the first two positions.\n\nWe could guess ""DONOR"" to test D and the double O? Or ""HONOR"" for H.\n\nBut we might also consider that the word might not have a vowel at position 2? But in ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"", position 2 is O, a vowel.\n\nIs there a word with a consonant at position 2? For example, ""BONOR"" not a word. ""GONOR"" not. ""KNOTS"" not.\n\nAnother idea: ""SNORE"" but S and E absent.\n\n""STORE"" E absent.\n\nSo I think we have to choose between ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"".\n\nBut let\'s see the definition: both are valid.\n\nPerhaps we can use a word that has different letters to get more information? But we are forced to have N, O, R at the end, so the first two letters are the only unknowns.\n\nIf we guess ""DONOR"", and it\'s wrong, we get feedback on D and the second O.\n\nSimilarly for ""HONOR"".\n\nBut we might run out of guesses? We have 3 guesses left? Actually, Wordle has 6 guesses total, we used 3, so 3 left.\n\nWe can also consider that the secret word might be ""MINOR"" but we know M and I are absent, so it can\'t be.\n\nAnother word: ""MANOR"" but M and A absent.\n\n""LONER"" but E absent and L? But LONER has E.\n\n""TONER"" E absent.\n\n""CONOR"" C absent.\n\nSo I think ""DONOR"" or ""HONOR"" are the only options.\n\nBut let\'s check if there is a word like ""DONOR"" but without the second O? No, because it must end with NOR.\n\nPerhaps ""DINAR"" but not NOR.\n\nI think we have to pick one.\n\nLet me choose ""HONOR"" because H is a common consonant.\n\nBut in ""HONOR"", the first letter is H, second is O.\n\nWe know O is at position 4, so if we guess ""HONOR"", and if the secret word is ""HONOR"", then we win.\n\nIf it\'s ""DONOR"", then we get feedback that H is absent? But H is at position 1, and if it\'s not H, then we know it must be D? Because only two options.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""DONOR"" and it\'s not, then we know it must be ""HONOR"".\n\nSo we can do that.\n\nBut we have to be careful: what if there is another word? For example, ""XENON"" but not ending with R.\n\nI think for now, we\'ll assume it\'s one of these two.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""HONOR"".\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nIf we guess ""HONOR"":\n  - Position 1: H -> if the secret word is ""HONOR"", then H is correct (✓). If it\'s ""DONOR"", then H is absent (x) because D is there.\n  - Position 2: O -> in both cases, if the secret word has O at position 2? But in ""DONOR"", position 2 is O, so if we guess O at position 2, and it is present, it should be yellow or green? But in ""DONOR"", O is at position 2 and 4. If we guess O at position 2, and the secret word is ""DONOR"", then since position 2 is O, it would be green? But we don\'t know if the secret word has O at position 2.\n\nIn ""HONOR"", we have O at position 2 and 4.\n\nIn ""DONOR"", we have O at position 2 and 4.\n\nSo both have O at position 2 and 4.\n\nTherefore, if we guess ""HONOR"", then:\n  - Position 1: H -> if secret is ""HONOR"", ✓; if ""DONOR"", then H is absent (x) because ""DONOR"" has D at 1, not H.\n  - Position 2: O -> in both cases, O is at position 2 in the secret? Yes, both words have O at 2, so it should be green (✓) for both.\n  - Position 3: N -> green (✓) for both.\n  - Position 4: O -> green (✓) for both.\n  - Position 5: R -> green (✓) for both.\n\nSo the feedback for ""HONOR"" would be:\n  - If secret is ""HONOR"": H(✓) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓) -> all correct.\n  - If secret is ""DONOR"": H(x) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓) -> because H is absent, but O at position 2 is correct.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""DONOR"":\n  - If secret is ""DONOR"": all ✓.\n  - If secret is ""HONOR"": D(x) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓).\n\nSo in either case, we can distinguish.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the secret word is one of these.\n\nBut let\'s assume it is.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""HONOR"".\n\nBut is there a possibility of another word? For example, ""OCTOR""? Not a word.\n\n""ACTOR"" but A and C absent.\n\nSo I think it\'s safe.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""HONOR"".\n\nBut note: in the feedback for MINOR, we had O at position 4 correct, but we didn\'t have O at position 2. So if the secret word has O at position 2, we don\'t know. But in ""HONOR"", we are guessing O at position 2, so we\'ll find out.\n\nBut we must consider that the secret word might not have O at position 2? But we couldn\'t find any other word.\n\nAnother word: ""JUNOR"" not.\n\n""VOTOR""? Not.\n\nI think we have to go with it.\n\nSo guess: HONOR\n\nBut let\'s output.### Analysis of Feedback and Current State\n\nAfter three guesses, we have the following information:\n\n1. **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: \n   - C (absent), R (present but not position 2), A (absent), N (present but not position 4), E (absent).\n   - **Absent letters**: C, A, E.\n   - **Present letters**: R, N (with position constraints).\n\n2. **Guess 2 (SPURN)**:\n   - S (absent), P (absent), U (absent), R (present but not position 4), N (present but not position 5).\n   - **New absent letters**: S, P, U.\n   - **Updated position constraints for R and N**: R cannot be in position 2 or 4; N cannot be in position 4 or 5.\n\n3. **Guess 3 (MINOR)**:\n   - M (absent), I (absent), N (correct position, position 3), O (correct position, position 4), R (correct position, position 5).\n   - **New absent letters**: M, I.\n   - **Confirmed positions**: \n     - Position 3: N\n     - Position 4: O\n     - Position 5: R\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Secret word structure**: The word must be `_ _ N O R` (positions 3, 4, and 5 are fixed as N, O, R).\n- **Absent letters (cannot use)**: A, C, E, I, M, P, S, U (8 letters).\n- **Available letters for positions 1 and 2**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (focus on common letters like D, H, L, T).\n- **Position constraints for R and N are satisfied** (R at 5, N at 3).\n- **O is confirmed at position 4**, but it may appear elsewhere (e.g., position 2) since we haven\'t tested other positions for O.\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- We need to guess a valid 5-letter word of the form `_ _ N O R`.\n- Common English words fitting this pattern:\n  - **HONOR**: Positions: H (1), O (2), N (3), O (4), R (5).\n  - **DONOR**: Positions: D (1), O (2), N (3), O (4), R (5).\n- Both words are valid and use available letters. No other common words fit the pattern (e.g., ""TONOR"" is invalid, ""MINOR"" is ruled out due to M and I being absent).\n- **Why choose ""HONOR""?**\n  - It tests H (a common consonant) and the possibility of O at position 2.\n  - Feedback will be decisive:\n    - If ""HONOR"" is correct, all positions will be green (✓).\n    - If incorrect (e.g., secret is ""DONOR""), feedback will show H as absent (x) and O at position 2 as correct (✓), narrowing it to ""DONOR"" for the next guess.\n- We have 3 guesses remaining, so this is a safe, information-maximizing choice.\n\n<guess>HONOR</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPURN -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) U(x) R(-) N(-)\nGuess 3: MINOR -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 4: HONOR -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from the fourth guess: HONOR -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)
 Breaking it down:
   - H is absent (x): meaning the letter H is not in the secret word at all.
   - O at position 2 is correct (✓): so position 2 of the secret word is O.
   - N at position 3 is correct (✓): already known.
   - O at position 4 is correct (✓): already known.
   - R at position 5 is correct: already known.

 Therefore, from the feedback:
   - Position 2 is O (since O(✓) at position 2).
   - Positions 3,4,5: N, O, R are fixed.
   - And H is absent.

 Now, we know the secret word has the following pattern: _ O N O R

 But note: we have two O's: one at position 2 and one at position 4? But we knew about position 4 from before, and now position 2 is also O.

 But the word begins with O? Not necessarily, we have position 1 unknown and position 2 is O.

 Pattern: [position1] O N O R

 And we know position 3 is N, position 4 is O, position 5 is R.

 The green O at position 2 means the secret word has O at position 2.

 Also, H is absent? Yes.

 Now, recall we have absent letters: from previous guesses: A, C, E, I, M, P, S, U, and now H.

 So absent: A, C, E, H, I, M, P, S, U.

 We need to fill position 1 with a letter that is not in the absent list, and the word must be valid.

 What words fit the pattern _ O N O R?

 We already considered ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"". But HONOR was just guessed, and H is absent? So ""HONOR"" cannot be the word because H is absent? Yes, H(x) means H is not in the word, but in ""HONOR"", H is at position 1, which means the word is not ""HONOR"" because it has H.

 Therefore, ""HONOR"" is incorrect because H is absent? Specifically, for position 1: we guessed H and it's absent, meaning H is not the letter at position 1 and also H is not present anywhere.

 But we also know from the pattern that the only other possibility we thought of is ""DONOR"".

 ""DONOR"": D at position 1, O at position 2, N at position 3, O at position 4, R at position 5.

 Now, D is not in the absent list? So D is still available.

 But are there other words?

 What about ""DONOR"": we haven't guessed it, and it fits.

 But is there another word? For example, ""BONOR""? Not a word.

 ""GONOR""? Not.

 ""LONOR""? Not.

 ""WONOR""? Not.

 ""TONOR""? Not.

 ""YONOR""? Not.

 ""FO?N O R"": but F available? But must be F O N O R? But ""FONOR"" not a word.

 ""OONOR""? Not common.

 So the only common word left is ""DONOR"".

 Therefore, we guess ""DONOR"".

 But we have to confirm: in ""DONOR"", the letter O appears twice? We know position 2 and 4 are O, which is correct.

 And D is available? Yes.

 Therefore, we guess ""DONOR"".

 But note: if there is a word like ""ZONOR"", but not valid.

 So I think ""DONOR"" is the only possibility.

 Let's guess ""DONOR"".
</think>
### Analysis of Feedback and Deductions

From the feedback on **Guess 4 (HONOR)**:
- **H(x)**: H is absent from the secret word.
- **O(✓) at position 2**: Confirms O is in position 2.
- **N(✓)** and **R(✓)** remain consistent with prior feedback.

### Updated Insights:
- **Secret word structure**: `_ O N O R` (positions 2, 3, 4, 5 confirmed as O, N, O, R).
- **Position 1** must be filled with a letter not in the absent list:
  - **Absent letters**: A, C, E, H, I, M, P, S, U (from all prior feedback).
  - **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Constraints**:
  - Secret word must be a **valid 5-letter English word** matching the pattern `_ O N O R`.
  - Narrowing possibilities:
    - ""HONOR"" is eliminated (H absent).
    - ""MINOR"" is eliminated (M and I absent).
    - **""DONOR"" to is the only common English word** fitting the pattern and constraints:
      - Positions: D (1), O (2), N (3), O (4), R (5).
      - D is available (not absent) and allows testing a new letter.
      - Pattern matches perfectly: `D O N O R`.

### Decision for Next Guess:
- **""DONOR""** must be the secret word, as it is the only valid word fitting the `_ O N O R` pattern, absent constraints, and prior feedback.
- If incorrect, feedback will pinpoint errors (unlikely).

<guess>DONOR</guess>",DONOR,"We have feedback from the fourth guess: HONOR -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)
 Breaking it down:
   - H is absent (x): meaning the letter H is not in the secret word at all.
   - O at position 2 is correct (✓): so position 2 of the secret word is O.
   - N at position 3 is correct (✓): already known.
   - O at position 4 is correct (✓): already known.
   - R at position 5 is correct: already known.

 Therefore, from the feedback:
   - Position 2 is O (since O(✓) at position 2).
   - Positions 3,4,5: N, O, R are fixed.
   - And H is absent.

 Now, we know the secret word has the following pattern: _ O N O R

 But note: we have two O's: one at position 2 and one at position 4? But we knew about position 4 from before, and now position 2 is also O.

 But the word begins with O? Not necessarily, we have position 1 unknown and position 2 is O.

 Pattern: [position1] O N O R

 And we know position 3 is N, position 4 is O, position 5 is R.

 The green O at position 2 means the secret word has O at position 2.

 Also, H is absent? Yes.

 Now, recall we have absent letters: from previous guesses: A, C, E, I, M, P, S, U, and now H.

 So absent: A, C, E, H, I, M, P, S, U.

 We need to fill position 1 with a letter that is not in the absent list, and the word must be valid.

 What words fit the pattern _ O N O R?

 We already considered ""DONOR"" and ""HONOR"". But HONOR was just guessed, and H is absent? So ""HONOR"" cannot be the word because H is absent? Yes, H(x) means H is not in the word, but in ""HONOR"", H is at position 1, which means the word is not ""HONOR"" because it has H.

 Therefore, ""HONOR"" is incorrect because H is absent? Specifically, for position 1: we guessed H and it's absent, meaning H is not the letter at position 1 and also H is not present anywhere.

 But we also know from the pattern that the only other possibility we thought of is ""DONOR"".

 ""DONOR"": D at position 1, O at position 2, N at position 3, O at position 4, R at position 5.

 Now, D is not in the absent list? So D is still available.

 But are there other words?

 What about ""DONOR"": we haven't guessed it, and it fits.

 But is there another word? For example, ""BONOR""? Not a word.

 ""GONOR""? Not.

 ""LONOR""? Not.

 ""WONOR""? Not.

 ""TONOR""? Not.

 ""YONOR""? Not.

 ""FO?N O R"": but F available? But must be F O N O R? But ""FONOR"" not a word.

 ""OONOR""? Not common.

 So the only common word left is ""DONOR"".

 Therefore, we guess ""DONOR"".

 But we have to confirm: in ""DONOR"", the letter O appears twice? We know position 2 and 4 are O, which is correct.

 And D is available? Yes.

 Therefore, we guess ""DONOR"".

 But note: if there is a word like ""ZONOR"", but not valid.

 So I think ""DONOR"" is the only possibility.

 Let's guess ""DONOR"".### Analysis of Feedback and Deductions
