We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as ""x"", meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 This means the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Since we have eliminated these letters, we need a new starting word that avoids these letters and uses other common letters.

 Common Vowels: We have eliminated A, E. Remaining vowels: I, O, U (and sometimes Y).
 Common Consonants: We have eliminated C, R, N. We still have many others like S, T, L, D, M, etc.

 We should choose a word that uses letters that are common and avoids the eliminated ones.

 Let's try to think of a word that has:
 - Vowels: O and/or U (or Y) and/or I
 - Consonants: S, T, L, D, H, M, P, etc.

 Since A and E are eliminated, avoid words containing those letters.

 Possible words: 
   We might try words like ""MOIST"", ""PIOUS"", ""BUOYS"", but note we need 5 letters and avoid A,E,R,N,C.

 However, note that ""CRANE"" had R and N which are also eliminated, so we must avoid R,A,N,E,C.

 Let's look for a word without A,E,R,N,C and with common letters from the rest.

 Some top letters to include: S, T, L, O, I, M, P, U, etc.

 Example: 
   ""SPLIT"" : S, P, L, I, T -> avoids the eliminated letters? S (ok), P (ok), L (ok), I (ok), T (ok). 
   ""MOUTH"": M, O, U, T, H -> avoids A,E,R,N,C.

 Another common start is ""ADIEU"", but it has A and E, so eliminated.

 Let me try ""SLOTH"": S, L, O, T, H -> avoids eliminated letters? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"": P, I, O, U, S -> avoids eliminated letters.

 But note: we want to cover as many new common letters as possible. 

 Considering frequency in English:
   After E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, we have eliminated A, E, R, N. So next are T, O, I, S, H.

 So ""TOILS"" or ""SHOUT"" might be good.

 However, we also note that we have eliminated C,R,A,N,E.

 Let's choose a word that uses T, O, I, S, L which are common and avoid the banned letters.

 I'll choose ""OIL"": but ""OIL"" is 3 letters, we need 5.

 One good candidate: ""BOILS"" ? but ""B"" is also a good letter to test. And ""BOILS"" has B, O, I, L, S. 
 But note: we don't know about B yet. Let me check if ""BOILS"" has any eliminated letter: B (ok), O (ok), I (ok), L (ok), S (ok). 

 But wait, we don't have feedback on B. However, we want to test other common letters.

 Alternatively, ""TOUCH"": but ""TOUCH"" has C and H? C is eliminated. So avoid.

 Since C is eliminated, we cannot use C.

 Let me avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 So try ""BOILS"": B, O, I, L, S -> all these are new and not eliminated.

 We can also consider ""MOULD"": M, O, U, L, D -> D is also a common letter? 

 But note: we might want to use a word that has letters that are more common.

 I think ""SLIPT"" (an alternative spelling of ""slipped"" but archaic; might not be recognized) -> avoid non-common words.

 Another common word: ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D -> but wait, N was eliminated! We cannot use N.

 So avoid N: because we had N in ""crane"" and it was wrong.

 Therefore, our word must not contain C, R, A, N, E.

 Our candidate words:
   ""BOILS"": avoids these letters: B,O,I,L,S -> suitable.
   ""SPLIT"": S,P,L,I,T -> avoids eliminated letters? C,R,A,N,E: no S,P,L,I,T -> good.

 Let me choose ""SPLIT"" because it includes T and P, which are common.

 But note: ""BOILS"" has B and O, and ""SPLIT"" has S, P, L, I, T.

 Since we have eliminated 5 letters, we have to make sure we cover new ones.

 Another word: ""SMITH"": S,M,I,T,H -> avoids eliminated letters? No A,E,R,N,C -> good.

 But ""SMITH"" has H which is less common than T, S, P? 

 Another option: ""PLUSH"": P,L,U,S,H -> avoids eliminated letters? Yes, but has H and U.

 We want to maximize information. 

 Considering frequency of letters in English 5-letter words: 
   After A,E,R,O,I,L,S,T,N,U we have eliminated A,E,R,N. So remaining top: O,I,S,T,L,U.

 I think ""TOILS"" would be good: T,O,I,L,S -> avoids A,E,R,N,C. And it has common letters.

 But wait, is ""TOILS"" a valid word? Yes, meaning tasks. 

 However, note that we are not using B, P, etc. But that's okay because we can get information on other letters.

 Alternatively, ""BOYSY"" is not valid.

 Let me pick ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S.

 But note: we have not tested B, D, M, P, U, etc. But we can only use 5 letters.

 We can try to cover as many as possible: 
   With 5 letters, we can cover 5.

 I'll decide to go with ""POUND"" ... wait, ""POUND"" has N? No! N is eliminated. So avoid ""POUND"".

 Then, maybe ""BUOYS"": B, U, O, Y, S -> avoids A,E,R,N,C. And Y is a vowel sometimes. ""BUOYS"" is a valid word.

 So let me compare:
   ""BOILS"": letters [B, O, I, L, S]
   ""BUOYS"": [B, U, O, Y, S] -> introduces U and Y, which we haven't tried. But we also get S and O.

 Alternatively, ""LOUSY"": L, O, U, S, Y -> valid.

 Which one is better? 

 How about we try a word that has a different vowel? In ""crane"" we had A and E (both vowels), now we want to test O, U, I, etc.

 Since A and E are out, we should test O, I, U, and Y if possible.

 I think ""LOUSY"": L, O, U, S, Y. This word has L,O,U,S,Y -> avoids the eliminated letters.

 ""LOUSY"" also includes two vowels (O, U) and sometimes Y. 

 But we haven't tested I? We can leave that for later.

 Alternatively, if we use ""BOILS"", we get O and I. 

 We might have to choose arbitrarily.

 Let me decide to pick ""BUOYS"" because it uses B, U, O, Y, S.

 But note: we are on the second guess and we can always adjust later. 

 However, I recall that ""SLATE"" is a common first word but we cannot use it because of A and E. 

 Since we need to avoid A,E,R,N,C, and we want to test more letters, I think ""BOUSY"" is not a word.

 I think ""BUOYS"" is valid. 

 But let me think of letter frequencies: 
   The most frequent letters excluding A,E,R,N: O,I,S,T,L,D,M,U,P,B,G,...

 We should prioritize letters that are more frequent.

 I think ""MOIST"" would be a good word: M, O, I, S, T -> avoids eliminated letters? Check: M (ok), O (ok), I (ok), S (ok), T (ok). Yes.

 ""MOIST"" is a common word.

 Why did I not think of ""MOIST""? It has M, O, I, S, T.

 So I will choose ""MOIST"".

 Let's go with ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T.

 We hope to get some hits.

 The guess is ""moist"".

<guess>moist</guess>
</think>
The first guess was ""crane"" and the feedback showed that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, we must choose a word that avoids these letters and uses other common letters to maximize information gain. Common vowels remaining are I, O, U, and sometimes Y, while common consonants include S, T, L, M, P, B, D, and others. 

A strong second guess should:
- Exclude C, R, A, N, E
- Include high-frequency letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, O, I)
- Cover multiple new vowels/consonants

After considering options like ""BOILS"" (B,O,I,L,S) and ""BUOYS"" (B,U,O,Y,S), ""MOIST"" (M,O,I,S,T) was selected because:
- It avoids all eliminated letters (C,R,A,N,E)
- It tests five new common letters: M, O, I, S, T
- O and I are high-frequency vowels; S and T are high-frequency consonants
- ""MOIST"" is a valid English word accepted in Wordle

 However, we also note that we have eliminated C,R,A,N,E.

 Let's choose a word that uses T, O, I, S, L which are common and avoid the banned letters.

 I'll choose ""OIL"": but ""OIL"" is 3 letters, we need 5.

 One good candidate: ""BOILS"" ? but ""B"" is also a good letter to test. And ""BOILS"" has B, O, I, L, S. 
 But note: we don't know about B yet. Let me check if ""BOILS"" has any eliminated letter: B (ok), O (ok), I (ok), L (ok), S (ok). 

 But wait, we don't have feedback on B. However, we want to test other common letters.

 Alternatively, ""TOUCH"": but ""TOUCH"" has C and H? C is eliminated. So avoid.

 Since C is eliminated, we cannot use C.

 Let me avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 So try ""BOILS"": B, O, I, L, S -> all these are new and not eliminated.

 We can also consider ""MOULD"": M, O, U, L, D -> D is also a common letter? 

 But note: we might want to use a word that has letters that are more common.

 I think ""SLIPT"" (an alternative spelling of ""slipped"" but archaic; might not be recognized) -> avoid non-common words.

 Another common word: ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D -> but wait, N was eliminated! We cannot use N.

 So avoid N: because we had N in ""crane"" and it was wrong.

 Therefore, our word must not contain C, R, A, N, E.

 Our candidate words:
   ""BOILS"": avoids these letters: B,O,I,L,S -> suitable.
   ""SPLIT"": S,P,L,I,T -> avoids eliminated letters? C,R,A,N,E: no S,P,L,I,T -> good.

 Let me choose ""SPLIT"" because it includes T and P, which are common.

 But note: ""BOILS"" has B and O, and ""SPLIT"" has S, P, L, I, T.

 Since we have eliminated 5 letters, we have to make sure we cover new ones.

 Another word: ""SMITH"": S,M,I,T,H -> avoids eliminated letters? No A,E,R,N,C -> good.

 But ""SMITH"" has H which is less common than T, S, P? 

 Another option: ""PLUSH"": P,L,U,S,H -> avoids eliminated letters? Yes, but has H and U.

 We want to maximize information. 

 Considering frequency of letters in English 5-letter words: 
   After A,E,R,O,I,L,S,T,N,U we have eliminated A,E,R,N. So remaining top: O,I,S,T,L,U.

 I think ""TOILS"" would be good: T,O,I,L,S -> avoids A,E,R,N,C. And it has common letters.

 But wait, is ""TOILS"" a valid word? Yes, meaning tasks. 

 However, note that we are not using B, P, etc. But that's okay because we can get information on other letters.

 Alternatively, ""BOYSY"" is not valid.

 Let me pick ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S.

 But note: we have not tested B, D, M, P, U, etc. But we can only use 5 letters.

 We can try to cover as many as possible: 
   With 5 letters, we can cover 5.

 I'll decide to go with ""POUND"" ... wait, ""POUND"" has N? No! N is eliminated. So avoid ""POUND"".

 Then, maybe ""BUOYS"": B, U, O, Y, S -> avoids A,E,R,N,C. And Y is a vowel sometimes. ""BUOYS"" is a valid word.

 So let me compare:
   ""BOILS"": letters [B, O, I, L, S]
   ""BUOYS"": [B, U, O, Y, S] -> introduces U and Y, which we haven't tried. But we also get S and O.

 Alternatively, ""LOUSY"": L, O, U, S, Y -> valid.

 Which one is better? 

 How about we try a word that has a different vowel? In ""crane"" we had A and E (both vowels), now we want to test O, U, I, etc.

 Since A and E are out, we should test O, I, U, and Y if possible.

 I think ""LOUSY"": L, O, U, S, Y. This word has L,O,U,S,Y -> avoids the eliminated letters.

 ""LOUSY"" also includes two vowels (O, U) and sometimes Y. 

 But we haven't tested I? We can leave that for later.

 Alternatively, if we use ""BOILS"", we get O and I. 

 We might have to choose arbitrarily.

 Let me decide to pick ""BUOYS"" because it uses B, U, O, Y, S.

 But note: we are on the second guess and we can always adjust later. 

 However, I recall that ""SLATE"" is a common first word but we cannot use it because of A and E. 

 Since we need to avoid A,E,R,N,C, and we want to test more letters, I think ""BOUSY"" is not a word.

 I think ""BUOYS"" is valid. 

 But let me think of letter frequencies: 
   The most frequent letters excluding A,E,R,N: O,I,S,T,L,D,M,U,P,B,G,...

 We should prioritize letters that are more frequent.

 I think ""MOIST"" would be a good word: M, O, I, S, T -> avoids eliminated letters? Check: M (ok), O (ok), I (ok), S (ok), T (ok). Yes.

 ""MOIST"" is a common word.

 Why did I not think of ""MOIST""? It has M, O, I, S, T.

 So I will choose ""MOIST"".

 Let's go with ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T.

 We hope to get some hits.

 The guess is ""moist"".

<guess>moist</guess>The first guess was ""crane"" and the feedback showed that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, we must choose a word that avoids these letters and uses other common letters to maximize information gain. Common vowels remaining are I, O, U, and sometimes Y, while common consonants include S, T, L, M, P, B, D, and others. 

A strong second guess should:
- Exclude C, R, A, N, E
- Include high-frequency letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, O, I)
- Cover multiple new vowels/consonants

After considering options like ""BOILS"" (B,O,I,L,S) and ""BUOYS"" (B,U,O,Y,S), ""MOIST"" (M,O,I,S,T) was selected because:
- It avoids all eliminated letters (C,R,A,N,E)
- It tests five new common letters: M, O, I, S, T
- O and I are high-frequency vowels; S and T are high-frequency consonants
- ""MOIST"" is a valid English word accepted in Wordle

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> all letters are incorrect: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So the secret word has none of these letters.

2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(x), S(-), T(x). 
   This means:
      - S is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked with '-')
      - M, O, I, T are not in the word at all.

So now we know:
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position (since in ""moist"" it was the 4th letter and it's wrong position).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

We have eliminated 10 letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

We also know that S is present, so we must include S in our next guess, but not in the 4th position.

Now, what letters are left? We have to consider the remaining letters of the alphabet.

The entire alphabet: A to Z.
Eliminated: A, C, E, I, M, N, O, R, T.

So remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: S is in the word, so we know at least one S is present. However, we don't know if there are more than one S? But the feedback for ""moist"" only showed one S, and it was in the wrong position. But it could be that there is only one S, or if there are two, the other one wasn't in the guess.

We must form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S (at least one, and not in the 4th position)
- Uses only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and note S is allowed, but we have to place it in a position that is not 4).

We also want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters among the remaining: 
  S (we already know is present, but we need to find its position), 
  then L, U, D, P, H, G, B, etc.

We should avoid using letters that are very rare (like Q, Z, X, J) if possible, to maximize the chance of hitting.

Possible words:

We need to place S in one of the positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since position 4 is not allowed for S in this guess because we know it's wrong there, but note: the word might have S in multiple positions? However, we don't know. But we must avoid putting S in position 4).

Let's think of words that have S in position 1, 2, 3, or 5, and use other letters from the remaining set.

Examples:

- S in position 1: 
   Words: SLYLY? (but has Y and L, but SLYLY is not common and has duplicate letters? Also, we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates, but we don't have evidence. We should avoid duplicates for now to test more letters.)
   Better: SHULY? Not a word. 
   How about ""SLUMP"": S, L, U, M, P -> but M is eliminated! We cannot use M.

We must avoid eliminated letters: M is eliminated.

So: 
   S in position 1: 
      Next letters: from B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but S is already used, so we can use others, but we can use S again? but we don't want to waste a letter slot if we can test a new one).

   Let me try to form a word: ""SLUSH"": S, L, U, S, H -> has two S's. But we don't know if the word has two S's. Also, H is allowed. But we are using S twice, which might not be efficient.

   ""SPLIT"": but P and L are allowed, but I and T are eliminated -> not allowed.

   ""SKULK"": S, K, U, L, K -> K and U and L are allowed, but has two K's? And ""SKULK"" is a word.

   But we have eliminated I and T, so we cannot use them.

   Another: ""SHOWY"": S, H, O, W, Y -> but O is eliminated! O is in the eliminated list.

   We must avoid O.

   So: ""SHULK"": S, H, U, L, K -> valid word? Not common. ""SHULK"" is not a standard word. 

   ""SHADY"": S, H, A, D, Y -> but A is eliminated.

   We must avoid A.

   ""SPUD"": only 4 letters.

   ""SPUDS"": S, P, U, D, S -> 5 letters, but ends with S. And has two S's. But ""SPUDS"" is a word.

   But we are using S twice, so we only test 4 distinct letters: S, P, U, D.

   Alternatively, ""SUSUS"" is not a word.

   ""SULKS"": S, U, L, K, S -> two S's.

   We might have to use a word with duplicate S if we can't find one without.

   But let's try without duplicate: ""SURLY"": S, U, R, L, Y -> but R is eliminated! R is in the eliminated list.

   So we cannot use R.

   ""SULKY"": S, U, L, K, Y -> all letters are allowed? S, U, L, K, Y. And ""SULKY"" is a word. It has no duplicates and uses new letters.

   So ""SULKY"" is a candidate.

- S in position 2:
   Words: ""USUAL"" -> U, S, U, A, L -> but A is eliminated and duplicate U? Also, ""USUAL"" has A which is eliminated.
   ""PSYCH"": P, S, Y, C, H -> but C is eliminated.
   ""BSKDS"" not a word.

   ""ASKED"": A and E eliminated.

   Hard to find. Let's skip for now.

- S in position 3:
   Words: ""BUSKS"": B, U, S, K, S -> two S's, and we have B, U, K. But duplicate S.
   ""FUSED"": F, U, S, E, D -> E eliminated.
   ""GUSSY"": G, U, S, S, Y -> two S's.

   ""PUSHY"": P, U, S, H, Y -> all allowed? P, U, S, H, Y. And ""PUSHY"" is a word. But S is in position 3, which is new.

   So ""PUSHY"" is a candidate.

- S in position 5:
   Words: ""_____S"" -> ending with S.
   ""PULPS"": P, U, L, P, S -> duplicate P? ""PULPS"" is a word, but duplicate P and we don't know if P is duplicated in the secret word.
   ""DUMPY"": D, U, M, P, Y -> M eliminated.
   ""BUGS"": only 4 letters.

   ""FUDGY"": F, U, D, G, Y -> no S? We need to include S.

   We need the word to end with S: ""LUMPS"": L, U, M, P, S -> M eliminated.
   ""PUMPS"": P, U, M, P, S -> M eliminated.

   ""BULKS"": B, U, L, K, S -> all allowed? B, U, L, K, S. And ""BULKS"" is a word. So candidate: ""BULKS"".

   ""HULKS"": H, U, L, K, S -> also valid.

   ""PUDUS"" -> not common.

So we have several candidates:
   - S in position 1: ""SULKY"" (S, U, L, K, Y)
   - S in position 3: ""PUSHY"" (P, U, S, H, Y)
   - S in position 5: ""BULKS"" (B, U, L, K, S) or ""HULKS"" (H, U, L, K, S)

We want to choose a word that tests new letters and has common letters.

Note: We know S is in the word, so we are going to get information about its position. We also want to test other letters that are common.

Among the remaining letters, the most common in English are L, U, D, P, H, G, B, etc.

We have two candidates that use U and L: ""SULKY"", ""BULKS"", ""HULKS"", and ""PUSHY"" uses U and H.

We also have Y in ""SULKY"" and ""PUSHY"", which is less common.

But note: we have eliminated many vowels (A, E, I, O) so U is the only vowel left that we haven't tested? We tested O and I in ""moist"" and they are absent, and A and E from ""crane"". So the word must have U? Not necessarily, because there might be Y acting as vowel, or no other vowel? But every word must have at least one vowel. The remaining vowels are U and Y (and sometimes W, but rare). So it's very likely that the word has U or Y.

We already know S is present, and we are including U in all our candidates. We are also testing Y in some.

But we don't know if U is in the word? We haven't tested U yet. So we should test U.

Similarly, we haven't tested L, K, H, P, B, etc.

So all candidates test U and S (which we know is present) and then other letters.

We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

In ""SULKY"": letters S, U, L, K, Y -> 5 distinct letters, all new except S.
In ""PUSHY"": P, U, S, H, Y -> 5 distinct, new except S.
In ""BULKS"": B, U, L, K, S -> 5 distinct, new except S.
In ""HULKS"": H, U, L, K, S -> same as BULKS but with H instead of B.

We don't know which of these letters are in the word, so any is fine.

But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters, and all these do.

We might choose the one that uses the most common letters. Among the remaining, L, U, and P are more common than K, Y, H, B.

But we don't have frequency data at hand.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S in a position we haven't tried. We tried S in position 4 (in ""moist"") and it was wrong. Now we are trying in position 1, 3, or 5.

We don't have information about position 1,2,3,5 for S.

But note: we have to place S in a position that is not 4. We can choose any of the others.

I think ""BULKS"" is a good candidate because it uses B, U, L, K, S. It has S at the end, which is a common position.

But let me see if there's a word that uses more common letters. For example, with P and L.

What about ""PLUSH""? P, L, U, S, H -> but S is in position 4? We cannot put S in position 4 because we know it's not there (from the feedback of ""moist"", the S was in position 4 and it was wrong, meaning the S is not in position 4). So we must avoid position 4 for S.

In ""PLUSH"", S is in position 4 -> not allowed.

Similarly, ""PULSH"" is not a word.

Another word: ""SLUMP"" is invalid because of M.

I think among the candidates, ""SULKY"" and ""BULKS"" are good.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are avoiding duplicates for now.

I'll go with ""BULKS"" because it has common consonants and ends with S, which is a common pattern.

But let me check: ""BULKS"" is a valid word.

Alternatively, ""HULKS"" is also valid and uses H instead of B. H is a common letter.

But B is slightly more common than H? Actually, in English, H is more common than B.

According to some sources, the frequency order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... then C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, ...

So after eliminating the top ones, H is the next common that we haven't tested? We haven't tested H, D, L, U, P, etc.

In our candidates:
   ""SULKY"": has U, L, K, Y -> K and Y are less common.
   ""PUSHY"": has P, U, H, Y -> H and P are common.
   ""BULKS"": has B, U, L, K -> B and K are less common.

So ""PUSHY"" might be better because it has H and P, which are more common than B and K.

But we also have U and L in ""BULKS"", which are common.

But ""PUSHY"" has H and P, and U and Y.

We can also consider ""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> but no S? We must include S.

We must include S.

Another candidate: ""GUSSY"" has two S's and G and Y -> but duplicate S and G and Y are less common.

I think ""PUSHY"" is a good choice: 
   - S is in position 3 (new position)
   - It tests P, U, S, H, Y.

But note: we are testing Y, which might be a vowel. Since we have no vowels A,E,I,O, the word must have U or Y. We are testing both U and Y in this word.

If we get a hit on U or Y, that would be helpful.

Alternatively, we can choose a word without Y to avoid the less common letter? But we have to use the available letters.

I think ""PUSHY"" is acceptable.

But let me see if there is a word that includes D, which is common.

For example, ""SUDDS"" -> duplicate D and S? Not good.

""SPUD"": 4 letters.

""DUSTS"": D, U, S, T, S -> T is eliminated and duplicate S.

Not possible.

""PUDUS"" not common.

So I think we should go with ""PUSHY"".

But wait, in ""PUSHY"", S is in position 3. We know that the secret word has S but not in position 4. We don't know about position 3.

Alternatively, we can choose a word with S in position 1 and include D: ""SUSED"" -> not a word.

""SHADY"" has A.

I think we have to pick from the candidates.

Another idea: ""LUSUS"" not a word.

I'll go with ""PUSHY"".

But note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""PUSHY"" is a valid word (meaning aggressive or forward).

So let's choose ""PUSHY"".

But wait, we have another candidate: ""SULKS"" (S, U, L, K, S) but duplicate S. We want to avoid duplicates to test more letters.

Similarly, ""BULKS"" is without duplicate.

But ""BULKS"" has B and K, which are less common.

Alternatively, ""HUSKY"": H, U, S, K, Y -> but S is in position 3? H-U-S-K-Y, so S is in position 3. And it has H, U, K, Y. And ""HUSKY"" is a word.

But we already have ""PUSHY"" and ""HUSKY"" is similar.

Now, between ""PUSHY"" and ""HUSKY"", which one? 
   ""PUSHY"": P, U, S, H, Y
   ""HUSKY"": H, U, S, K, Y

They both have U, S, Y and either P or H and K? Actually, ""HUSKY"" has H and K, and ""PUSHY"" has P and H.

We haven't tested H, P, or K.

But H is more common than P and K.

So ""HUSKY"" has H and K, and ""PUSHY"" has P and H.

I think both are acceptable.

But note: we are trying to find the position of S. In both, S is in position 3. So we are testing the same position.

We might as well choose one.

I'll choose ""HUSKY"" because it has H which is common.

But wait, we have a candidate with L: ""SULKY"" (S, U, L, K, Y) -> S in position 1, and L is common.

""SULKY"" has L, which is more common than K and Y.

In ""SULKY"": 
   Position 1: S (we are testing if S is in position 1)
   Position 2: U
   Position 3: L
   Position 4: K
   Position 5: Y

We know S is in the word, but not in position 4. We are testing position 1.

Also, L is a common letter that we haven't tested.

So ""SULKY"" might be better because it tests S in a new position (1) and includes L.

Similarly, ""HUSKY"" tests S in position 3.

We don't have any information about position 1, so it's good to test.

I think I'll go with ""SULKY"".

So the next guess is ""SULKY"".

But let me confirm the letters: S, U, L, K, Y. None of these are eliminated? 
   Eliminated: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T -> none of S,U,L,K,Y are in that list. So yes.

And it's a valid word.

So <guess>sulky</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗). This eliminates these 5 letters.
- **Guess 2: ""moist""** → Only ""S"" is present but in the wrong position (-). Letters M, O, I, T are absent (✗). This eliminates 4 additional letters (M, O, I, T) and confirms ""S"" is in the word but not in position 4.

**Key insights:**
- The secret word contains ""S"" (not in position 4) and excludes: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T (9 letters eliminated).
- Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- ""S"" must be included in the next guess but cannot be in position 4 (index 3, 0-based).
- Focus on testing high-frequency remaining letters (e.g., L, U, H, P, D) and vowels (U, Y, as A, E, I, O are eliminated).

**Strategy for Guess 3:**
- Choose a word with ""S"" in a new position (not 4) and maximize coverage of untested common letters.
- Avoid eliminated letters and prioritize distinct letters to test more possibilities.
- Candidate words considered: 
  - ""SULKY"" (S in position 1, tests U, L, K, Y).
  - ""PUSHY"" (S in position 3, tests P, U, H, Y).
  - ""HUSKY"" (S in position 3, tests H, U, K, Y).
  - ""BULKS"" (S in position 5, tests B, U, L, K).
- **Selected ""SULKY""** because:
  - Places ""S"" in position 1 (untested position, since position 4 is invalid).
  - Tests 4 new high-value letters: U (common vowel), L (high-frequency consonant), K, and Y (vowel substitute).
  - Uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.
  - Valid 5-letter word that avoids all eliminated letters.

<guess>sulky</guess>",sulky,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> all letters are incorrect: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So the secret word has none of these letters.

2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(x), S(-), T(x). 
   This means:
      - S is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked with '-')
      - M, O, I, T are not in the word at all.

So now we know:
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position (since in ""moist"" it was the 4th letter and it's wrong position).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

We have eliminated 10 letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

We also know that S is present, so we must include S in our next guess, but not in the 4th position.

Now, what letters are left? We have to consider the remaining letters of the alphabet.

The entire alphabet: A to Z.
Eliminated: A, C, E, I, M, N, O, R, T.

So remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: S is in the word, so we know at least one S is present. However, we don't know if there are more than one S? But the feedback for ""moist"" only showed one S, and it was in the wrong position. But it could be that there is only one S, or if there are two, the other one wasn't in the guess.

We must form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S (at least one, and not in the 4th position)
- Uses only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and note S is allowed, but we have to place it in a position that is not 4).

We also want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters among the remaining: 
  S (we already know is present, but we need to find its position), 
  then L, U, D, P, H, G, B, etc.

We should avoid using letters that are very rare (like Q, Z, X, J) if possible, to maximize the chance of hitting.

Possible words:

We need to place S in one of the positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since position 4 is not allowed for S in this guess because we know it's wrong there, but note: the word might have S in multiple positions? However, we don't know. But we must avoid putting S in position 4).

Let's think of words that have S in position 1, 2, 3, or 5, and use other letters from the remaining set.

Examples:

- S in position 1: 
   Words: SLYLY? (but has Y and L, but SLYLY is not common and has duplicate letters? Also, we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates, but we don't have evidence. We should avoid duplicates for now to test more letters.)
   Better: SHULY? Not a word. 
   How about ""SLUMP"": S, L, U, M, P -> but M is eliminated! We cannot use M.

We must avoid eliminated letters: M is eliminated.

So: 
   S in position 1: 
      Next letters: from B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but S is already used, so we can use others, but we can use S again? but we don't want to waste a letter slot if we can test a new one).

   Let me try to form a word: ""SLUSH"": S, L, U, S, H -> has two S's. But we don't know if the word has two S's. Also, H is allowed. But we are using S twice, which might not be efficient.

   ""SPLIT"": but P and L are allowed, but I and T are eliminated -> not allowed.

   ""SKULK"": S, K, U, L, K -> K and U and L are allowed, but has two K's? And ""SKULK"" is a word.

   But we have eliminated I and T, so we cannot use them.

   Another: ""SHOWY"": S, H, O, W, Y -> but O is eliminated! O is in the eliminated list.

   We must avoid O.

   So: ""SHULK"": S, H, U, L, K -> valid word? Not common. ""SHULK"" is not a standard word. 

   ""SHADY"": S, H, A, D, Y -> but A is eliminated.

   We must avoid A.

   ""SPUD"": only 4 letters.

   ""SPUDS"": S, P, U, D, S -> 5 letters, but ends with S. And has two S's. But ""SPUDS"" is a word.

   But we are using S twice, so we only test 4 distinct letters: S, P, U, D.

   Alternatively, ""SUSUS"" is not a word.

   ""SULKS"": S, U, L, K, S -> two S's.

   We might have to use a word with duplicate S if we can't find one without.

   But let's try without duplicate: ""SURLY"": S, U, R, L, Y -> but R is eliminated! R is in the eliminated list.

   So we cannot use R.

   ""SULKY"": S, U, L, K, Y -> all letters are allowed? S, U, L, K, Y. And ""SULKY"" is a word. It has no duplicates and uses new letters.

   So ""SULKY"" is a candidate.

- S in position 2:
   Words: ""USUAL"" -> U, S, U, A, L -> but A is eliminated and duplicate U? Also, ""USUAL"" has A which is eliminated.
   ""PSYCH"": P, S, Y, C, H -> but C is eliminated.
   ""BSKDS"" not a word.

   ""ASKED"": A and E eliminated.

   Hard to find. Let's skip for now.

- S in position 3:
   Words: ""BUSKS"": B, U, S, K, S -> two S's, and we have B, U, K. But duplicate S.
   ""FUSED"": F, U, S, E, D -> E eliminated.
   ""GUSSY"": G, U, S, S, Y -> two S's.

   ""PUSHY"": P, U, S, H, Y -> all allowed? P, U, S, H, Y. And ""PUSHY"" is a word. But S is in position 3, which is new.

   So ""PUSHY"" is a candidate.

- S in position 5:
   Words: ""_____S"" -> ending with S.
   ""PULPS"": P, U, L, P, S -> duplicate P? ""PULPS"" is a word, but duplicate P and we don't know if P is duplicated in the secret word.
   ""DUMPY"": D, U, M, P, Y -> M eliminated.
   ""BUGS"": only 4 letters.

   ""FUDGY"": F, U, D, G, Y -> no S? We need to include S.

   We need the word to end with S: ""LUMPS"": L, U, M, P, S -> M eliminated.
   ""PUMPS"": P, U, M, P, S -> M eliminated.

   ""BULKS"": B, U, L, K, S -> all allowed? B, U, L, K, S. And ""BULKS"" is a word. So candidate: ""BULKS"".

   ""HULKS"": H, U, L, K, S -> also valid.

   ""PUDUS"" -> not common.

So we have several candidates:
   - S in position 1: ""SULKY"" (S, U, L, K, Y)
   - S in position 3: ""PUSHY"" (P, U, S, H, Y)
   - S in position 5: ""BULKS"" (B, U, L, K, S) or ""HULKS"" (H, U, L, K, S)

We want to choose a word that tests new letters and has common letters.

Note: We know S is in the word, so we are going to get information about its position. We also want to test other letters that are common.

Among the remaining letters, the most common in English are L, U, D, P, H, G, B, etc.

We have two candidates that use U and L: ""SULKY"", ""BULKS"", ""HULKS"", and ""PUSHY"" uses U and H.

We also have Y in ""SULKY"" and ""PUSHY"", which is less common.

But note: we have eliminated many vowels (A, E, I, O) so U is the only vowel left that we haven't tested? We tested O and I in ""moist"" and they are absent, and A and E from ""crane"". So the word must have U? Not necessarily, because there might be Y acting as vowel, or no other vowel? But every word must have at least one vowel. The remaining vowels are U and Y (and sometimes W, but rare). So it's very likely that the word has U or Y.

We already know S is present, and we are including U in all our candidates. We are also testing Y in some.

But we don't know if U is in the word? We haven't tested U yet. So we should test U.

Similarly, we haven't tested L, K, H, P, B, etc.

So all candidates test U and S (which we know is present) and then other letters.

We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

In ""SULKY"": letters S, U, L, K, Y -> 5 distinct letters, all new except S.
In ""PUSHY"": P, U, S, H, Y -> 5 distinct, new except S.
In ""BULKS"": B, U, L, K, S -> 5 distinct, new except S.
In ""HULKS"": H, U, L, K, S -> same as BULKS but with H instead of B.

We don't know which of these letters are in the word, so any is fine.

But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters, and all these do.

We might choose the one that uses the most common letters. Among the remaining, L, U, and P are more common than K, Y, H, B.

But we don't have frequency data at hand.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S in a position we haven't tried. We tried S in position 4 (in ""moist"") and it was wrong. Now we are trying in position 1, 3, or 5.

We don't have information about position 1,2,3,5 for S.

But note: we have to place S in a position that is not 4. We can choose any of the others.

I think ""BULKS"" is a good candidate because it uses B, U, L, K, S. It has S at the end, which is a common position.

But let me see if there's a word that uses more common letters. For example, with P and L.

What about ""PLUSH""? P, L, U, S, H -> but S is in position 4? We cannot put S in position 4 because we know it's not there (from the feedback of ""moist"", the S was in position 4 and it was wrong, meaning the S is not in position 4). So we must avoid position 4 for S.

In ""PLUSH"", S is in position 4 -> not allowed.

Similarly, ""PULSH"" is not a word.

Another word: ""SLUMP"" is invalid because of M.

I think among the candidates, ""SULKY"" and ""BULKS"" are good.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are avoiding duplicates for now.

I'll go with ""BULKS"" because it has common consonants and ends with S, which is a common pattern.

But let me check: ""BULKS"" is a valid word.

Alternatively, ""HULKS"" is also valid and uses H instead of B. H is a common letter.

But B is slightly more common than H? Actually, in English, H is more common than B.

According to some sources, the frequency order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... then C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, ...

So after eliminating the top ones, H is the next common that we haven't tested? We haven't tested H, D, L, U, P, etc.

In our candidates:
   ""SULKY"": has U, L, K, Y -> K and Y are less common.
   ""PUSHY"": has P, U, H, Y -> H and P are common.
   ""BULKS"": has B, U, L, K -> B and K are less common.

So ""PUSHY"" might be better because it has H and P, which are more common than B and K.

But we also have U and L in ""BULKS"", which are common.

But ""PUSHY"" has H and P, and U and Y.

We can also consider ""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> but no S? We must include S.

We must include S.

Another candidate: ""GUSSY"" has two S's and G and Y -> but duplicate S and G and Y are less common.

I think ""PUSHY"" is a good choice: 
   - S is in position 3 (new position)
   - It tests P, U, S, H, Y.

But note: we are testing Y, which might be a vowel. Since we have no vowels A,E,I,O, the word must have U or Y. We are testing both U and Y in this word.

If we get a hit on U or Y, that would be helpful.

Alternatively, we can choose a word without Y to avoid the less common letter? But we have to use the available letters.

I think ""PUSHY"" is acceptable.

But let me see if there is a word that includes D, which is common.

For example, ""SUDDS"" -> duplicate D and S? Not good.

""SPUD"": 4 letters.

""DUSTS"": D, U, S, T, S -> T is eliminated and duplicate S.

Not possible.

""PUDUS"" not common.

So I think we should go with ""PUSHY"".

But wait, in ""PUSHY"", S is in position 3. We know that the secret word has S but not in position 4. We don't know about position 3.

Alternatively, we can choose a word with S in position 1 and include D: ""SUSED"" -> not a word.

""SHADY"" has A.

I think we have to pick from the candidates.

Another idea: ""LUSUS"" not a word.

I'll go with ""PUSHY"".

But note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""PUSHY"" is a valid word (meaning aggressive or forward).

So let's choose ""PUSHY"".

But wait, we have another candidate: ""SULKS"" (S, U, L, K, S) but duplicate S. We want to avoid duplicates to test more letters.

Similarly, ""BULKS"" is without duplicate.

But ""BULKS"" has B and K, which are less common.

Alternatively, ""HUSKY"": H, U, S, K, Y -> but S is in position 3? H-U-S-K-Y, so S is in position 3. And it has H, U, K, Y. And ""HUSKY"" is a word.

But we already have ""PUSHY"" and ""HUSKY"" is similar.

Now, between ""PUSHY"" and ""HUSKY"", which one? 
   ""PUSHY"": P, U, S, H, Y
   ""HUSKY"": H, U, S, K, Y

They both have U, S, Y and either P or H and K? Actually, ""HUSKY"" has H and K, and ""PUSHY"" has P and H.

We haven't tested H, P, or K.

But H is more common than P and K.

So ""HUSKY"" has H and K, and ""PUSHY"" has P and H.

I think both are acceptable.

But note: we are trying to find the position of S. In both, S is in position 3. So we are testing the same position.

We might as well choose one.

I'll choose ""HUSKY"" because it has H which is common.

But wait, we have a candidate with L: ""SULKY"" (S, U, L, K, Y) -> S in position 1, and L is common.

""SULKY"" has L, which is more common than K and Y.

In ""SULKY"": 
   Position 1: S (we are testing if S is in position 1)
   Position 2: U
   Position 3: L
   Position 4: K
   Position 5: Y

We know S is in the word, but not in position 4. We are testing position 1.

Also, L is a common letter that we haven't tested.

So ""SULKY"" might be better because it tests S in a new position (1) and includes L.

Similarly, ""HUSKY"" tests S in position 3.

We don't have any information about position 1, so it's good to test.

I think I'll go with ""SULKY"".

So the next guess is ""SULKY"".

But let me confirm the letters: S, U, L, K, Y. None of these are eliminated? 
   Eliminated: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T -> none of S,U,L,K,Y are in that list. So yes.

And it's a valid word.

So <guess>sulky</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗). This eliminates these 5 letters.
- **Guess 2: ""moist""** → Only ""S"" is present but in the wrong position (-). Letters M, O, I, T are absent (✗). This eliminates 4 additional letters (M, O, I, T) and confirms ""S"" is in the word but not in position 4.

**Key insights:**
- The secret word contains ""S"" (not in position 4) and excludes: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T (9 letters eliminated).
- Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- ""S"" must be included in the next guess but cannot be in position 4 (index 3, 0-based).
- Focus on testing high-frequency remaining letters (e.g., L, U, H, P, D) and vowels (U, Y, as A, E, I, O are eliminated).

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as ""x"", meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 This means the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Since we have eliminated these letters, we need a new starting word that avoids these letters and uses other common letters.

 Common Vowels: We have eliminated A, E. Remaining vowels: I, O, U (and sometimes Y).
 Common Consonants: We have eliminated C, R, N. We still have many others like S, T, L, D, M, etc.

 We should choose a word that uses letters that are common and avoids the eliminated ones.

 Let's try to think of a word that has:
 - Vowels: O and/or U (or Y) and/or I
 - Consonants: S, T, L, D, H, M, P, etc.

 Since A and E are eliminated, avoid words containing those letters.

 Possible words: 
   We might try words like ""MOIST"", ""PIOUS"", ""BUOYS"", but note we need 5 letters and avoid A,E,R,N,C.

 However, note that ""CRANE"" had R and N which are also eliminated, so we must avoid R,A,N,E,C.

 Let's look for a word without A,E,R,N,C and with common letters from the rest.

 Some top letters to include: S, T, L, O, I, M, P, U, etc.

 Example: 
   ""SPLIT"" : S, P, L, I, T -> avoids the eliminated letters? S (ok), P (ok), L (ok), I (ok), T (ok). 
   ""MOUTH"": M, O, U, T, H -> avoids A,E,R,N,C.

 Another common start is ""ADIEU"", but it has A and E, so eliminated.

 Let me try ""SLOTH"": S, L, O, T, H -> avoids eliminated letters? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"": P, I, O, U, S -> avoids eliminated letters.

 But note: we want to cover as many new common letters as possible. 

 Considering frequency in English:
   After E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, we have eliminated A, E, R, N. So next are T, O, I, S, H.

 So ""TOILS"" or ""SHOUT"" might be good.

 However, we also note that we have eliminated C,R,A,N,E.

 Let's choose a word that uses T, O, I, S, L which are common and avoid the banned letters.

 I'll choose ""OIL"": but ""OIL"" is 3 letters, we need 5.

 One good candidate: ""BOILS"" ? but ""B"" is also a good letter to test. And ""BOILS"" has B, O, I, L, S. 
 But note: we don't know about B yet. Let me check if ""BOILS"" has any eliminated letter: B (ok), O (ok), I (ok), L (ok), S (ok). 

 But wait, we don't have feedback on B. However, we want to test other common letters.

 Alternatively, ""TOUCH"": but ""TOUCH"" has C and H? C is eliminated. So avoid.

 Since C is eliminated, we cannot use C.

 Let me avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 So try ""BOILS"": B, O, I, L, S -> all these are new and not eliminated.

 We can also consider ""MOULD"": M, O, U, L, D -> D is also a common letter? 

 But note: we might want to use a word that has letters that are more common.

 I think ""SLIPT"" (an alternative spelling of ""slipped"" but archaic; might not be recognized) -> avoid non-common words.

 Another common word: ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D -> but wait, N was eliminated! We cannot use N.

 So avoid N: because we had N in ""crane"" and it was wrong.

 Therefore, our word must not contain C, R, A, N, E.

 Our candidate words:
   ""BOILS"": avoids these letters: B,O,I,L,S -> suitable.
   ""SPLIT"": S,P,L,I,T -> avoids eliminated letters? C,R,A,N,E: no S,P,L,I,T -> good.

 Let me choose ""SPLIT"" because it includes T and P, which are common.

 But note: ""BOILS"" has B and O, and ""SPLIT"" has S, P, L, I, T.

 Since we have eliminated 5 letters, we have to make sure we cover new ones.

 Another word: ""SMITH"": S,M,I,T,H -> avoids eliminated letters? No A,E,R,N,C -> good.

 But ""SMITH"" has H which is less common than T, S, P? 

 Another option: ""PLUSH"": P,L,U,S,H -> avoids eliminated letters? Yes, but has H and U.

 We want to maximize information. 

 Considering frequency of letters in English 5-letter words: 
   After A,E,R,O,I,L,S,T,N,U we have eliminated A,E,R,N. So remaining top: O,I,S,T,L,U.

 I think ""TOILS"" would be good: T,O,I,L,S -> avoids A,E,R,N,C. And it has common letters.

 But wait, is ""TOILS"" a valid word? Yes, meaning tasks. 

 However, note that we are not using B, P, etc. But that's okay because we can get information on other letters.

 Alternatively, ""BOYSY"" is not valid.

 Let me pick ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S.

 But note: we have not tested B, D, M, P, U, etc. But we can only use 5 letters.

 We can try to cover as many as possible: 
   With 5 letters, we can cover 5.

 I'll decide to go with ""POUND"" ... wait, ""POUND"" has N? No! N is eliminated. So avoid ""POUND"".

 Then, maybe ""BUOYS"": B, U, O, Y, S -> avoids A,E,R,N,C. And Y is a vowel sometimes. ""BUOYS"" is a valid word.

 So let me compare:
   ""BOILS"": letters [B, O, I, L, S]
   ""BUOYS"": [B, U, O, Y, S] -> introduces U and Y, which we haven't tried. But we also get S and O.

 Alternatively, ""LOUSY"": L, O, U, S, Y -> valid.

 Which one is better? 

 How about we try a word that has a different vowel? In ""crane"" we had A and E (both vowels), now we want to test O, U, I, etc.

 Since A and E are out, we should test O, I, U, and Y if possible.

 I think ""LOUSY"": L, O, U, S, Y. This word has L,O,U,S,Y -> avoids the eliminated letters.

 ""LOUSY"" also includes two vowels (O, U) and sometimes Y. 

 But we haven't tested I? We can leave that for later.

 Alternatively, if we use ""BOILS"", we get O and I. 

 We might have to choose arbitrarily.

 Let me decide to pick ""BUOYS"" because it uses B, U, O, Y, S.

 But note: we are on the second guess and we can always adjust later. 

 However, I recall that ""SLATE"" is a common first word but we cannot use it because of A and E. 

 Since we need to avoid A,E,R,N,C, and we want to test more letters, I think ""BOUSY"" is not a word.

 I think ""BUOYS"" is valid. 

 But let me think of letter frequencies: 
   The most frequent letters excluding A,E,R,N: O,I,S,T,L,D,M,U,P,B,G,...

 We should prioritize letters that are more frequent.

 I think ""MOIST"" would be a good word: M, O, I, S, T -> avoids eliminated letters? Check: M (ok), O (ok), I (ok), S (ok), T (ok). Yes.

 ""MOIST"" is a common word.

 Why did I not think of ""MOIST""? It has M, O, I, S, T.

 So I will choose ""MOIST"".

 Let's go with ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T.

 We hope to get some hits.

 The guess is ""moist"".

<guess>moist</guess>The first guess was ""crane"" and the feedback showed that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, we must choose a word that avoids these letters and uses other common letters to maximize information gain. Common vowels remaining are I, O, U, and sometimes Y, while common consonants include S, T, L, M, P, B, D, and others. 

A strong second guess should:
- Exclude C, R, A, N, E
- Include high-frequency letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, O, I)
- Cover multiple new vowels/consonants

After considering options like ""BOILS"" (B,O,I,L,S) and ""BUOYS"" (B,U,O,Y,S), ""MOIST"" (M,O,I,S,T) was selected because:
- It avoids all eliminated letters (C,R,A,N,E)
- It tests five new common letters: M, O, I, S, T
- O and I are high-frequency vowels; S and T are high-frequency consonants
- ""MOIST"" is a valid English word accepted in Wordle

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> all letters are incorrect: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So the secret word has none of these letters.

2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(x), S(-), T(x). 
   This means:
      - S is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked with '-')
      - M, O, I, T are not in the word at all.

So now we know:
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position (since in ""moist"" it was the 4th letter and it's wrong position).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

We have eliminated 10 letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

We also know that S is present, so we must include S in our next guess, but not in the 4th position.

Now, what letters are left? We have to consider the remaining letters of the alphabet.

The entire alphabet: A to Z.
Eliminated: A, C, E, I, M, N, O, R, T.

So remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: S is in the word, so we know at least one S is present. However, we don't know if there are more than one S? But the feedback for ""moist"" only showed one S, and it was in the wrong position. But it could be that there is only one S, or if there are two, the other one wasn't in the guess.

We must form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S (at least one, and not in the 4th position)
- Uses only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and note S is allowed, but we have to place it in a position that is not 4).

We also want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters among the remaining: 
  S (we already know is present, but we need to find its position), 
  then L, U, D, P, H, G, B, etc.

We should avoid using letters that are very rare (like Q, Z, X, J) if possible, to maximize the chance of hitting.

Possible words:

We need to place S in one of the positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since position 4 is not allowed for S in this guess because we know it's wrong there, but note: the word might have S in multiple positions? However, we don't know. But we must avoid putting S in position 4).

Let's think of words that have S in position 1, 2, 3, or 5, and use other letters from the remaining set.

Examples:

- S in position 1: 
   Words: SLYLY? (but has Y and L, but SLYLY is not common and has duplicate letters? Also, we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates, but we don't have evidence. We should avoid duplicates for now to test more letters.)
   Better: SHULY? Not a word. 
   How about ""SLUMP"": S, L, U, M, P -> but M is eliminated! We cannot use M.

We must avoid eliminated letters: M is eliminated.

So: 
   S in position 1: 
      Next letters: from B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but S is already used, so we can use others, but we can use S again? but we don't want to waste a letter slot if we can test a new one).

   Let me try to form a word: ""SLUSH"": S, L, U, S, H -> has two S's. But we don't know if the word has two S's. Also, H is allowed. But we are using S twice, which might not be efficient.

   ""SPLIT"": but P and L are allowed, but I and T are eliminated -> not allowed.

   ""SKULK"": S, K, U, L, K -> K and U and L are allowed, but has two K's? And ""SKULK"" is a word.

   But we have eliminated I and T, so we cannot use them.

   Another: ""SHOWY"": S, H, O, W, Y -> but O is eliminated! O is in the eliminated list.

   We must avoid O.

   So: ""SHULK"": S, H, U, L, K -> valid word? Not common. ""SHULK"" is not a standard word. 

   ""SHADY"": S, H, A, D, Y -> but A is eliminated.

   We must avoid A.

   ""SPUD"": only 4 letters.

   ""SPUDS"": S, P, U, D, S -> 5 letters, but ends with S. And has two S's. But ""SPUDS"" is a word.

   But we are using S twice, so we only test 4 distinct letters: S, P, U, D.

   Alternatively, ""SUSUS"" is not a word.

   ""SULKS"": S, U, L, K, S -> two S's.

   We might have to use a word with duplicate S if we can't find one without.

   But let's try without duplicate: ""SURLY"": S, U, R, L, Y -> but R is eliminated! R is in the eliminated list.

   So we cannot use R.

   ""SULKY"": S, U, L, K, Y -> all letters are allowed? S, U, L, K, Y. And ""SULKY"" is a word. It has no duplicates and uses new letters.

   So ""SULKY"" is a candidate.

- S in position 2:
   Words: ""USUAL"" -> U, S, U, A, L -> but A is eliminated and duplicate U? Also, ""USUAL"" has A which is eliminated.
   ""PSYCH"": P, S, Y, C, H -> but C is eliminated.
   ""BSKDS"" not a word.

   ""ASKED"": A and E eliminated.

   Hard to find. Let's skip for now.

- S in position 3:
   Words: ""BUSKS"": B, U, S, K, S -> two S's, and we have B, U, K. But duplicate S.
   ""FUSED"": F, U, S, E, D -> E eliminated.
   ""GUSSY"": G, U, S, S, Y -> two S's.

   ""PUSHY"": P, U, S, H, Y -> all allowed? P, U, S, H, Y. And ""PUSHY"" is a word. But S is in position 3, which is new.

   So ""PUSHY"" is a candidate.

- S in position 5:
   Words: ""_____S"" -> ending with S.
   ""PULPS"": P, U, L, P, S -> duplicate P? ""PULPS"" is a word, but duplicate P and we don't know if P is duplicated in the secret word.
   ""DUMPY"": D, U, M, P, Y -> M eliminated.
   ""BUGS"": only 4 letters.

   ""FUDGY"": F, U, D, G, Y -> no S? We need to include S.

   We need the word to end with S: ""LUMPS"": L, U, M, P, S -> M eliminated.
   ""PUMPS"": P, U, M, P, S -> M eliminated.

   ""BULKS"": B, U, L, K, S -> all allowed? B, U, L, K, S. And ""BULKS"" is a word. So candidate: ""BULKS"".

   ""HULKS"": H, U, L, K, S -> also valid.

   ""PUDUS"" -> not common.

So we have several candidates:
   - S in position 1: ""SULKY"" (S, U, L, K, Y)
   - S in position 3: ""PUSHY"" (P, U, S, H, Y)
   - S in position 5: ""BULKS"" (B, U, L, K, S) or ""HULKS"" (H, U, L, K, S)

We want to choose a word that tests new letters and has common letters.

Note: We know S is in the word, so we are going to get information about its position. We also want to test other letters that are common.

Among the remaining letters, the most common in English are L, U, D, P, H, G, B, etc.

We have two candidates that use U and L: ""SULKY"", ""BULKS"", ""HULKS"", and ""PUSHY"" uses U and H.

We also have Y in ""SULKY"" and ""PUSHY"", which is less common.

But note: we have eliminated many vowels (A, E, I, O) so U is the only vowel left that we haven't tested? We tested O and I in ""moist"" and they are absent, and A and E from ""crane"". So the word must have U? Not necessarily, because there might be Y acting as vowel, or no other vowel? But every word must have at least one vowel. The remaining vowels are U and Y (and sometimes W, but rare). So it's very likely that the word has U or Y.

We already know S is present, and we are including U in all our candidates. We are also testing Y in some.

But we don't know if U is in the word? We haven't tested U yet. So we should test U.

Similarly, we haven't tested L, K, H, P, B, etc.

So all candidates test U and S (which we know is present) and then other letters.

We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

In ""SULKY"": letters S, U, L, K, Y -> 5 distinct letters, all new except S.
In ""PUSHY"": P, U, S, H, Y -> 5 distinct, new except S.
In ""BULKS"": B, U, L, K, S -> 5 distinct, new except S.
In ""HULKS"": H, U, L, K, S -> same as BULKS but with H instead of B.

We don't know which of these letters are in the word, so any is fine.

But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters, and all these do.

We might choose the one that uses the most common letters. Among the remaining, L, U, and P are more common than K, Y, H, B.

But we don't have frequency data at hand.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S in a position we haven't tried. We tried S in position 4 (in ""moist"") and it was wrong. Now we are trying in position 1, 3, or 5.

We don't have information about position 1,2,3,5 for S.

But note: we have to place S in a position that is not 4. We can choose any of the others.

I think ""BULKS"" is a good candidate because it uses B, U, L, K, S. It has S at the end, which is a common position.

But let me see if there's a word that uses more common letters. For example, with P and L.

What about ""PLUSH""? P, L, U, S, H -> but S is in position 4? We cannot put S in position 4 because we know it's not there (from the feedback of ""moist"", the S was in position 4 and it was wrong, meaning the S is not in position 4). So we must avoid position 4 for S.

In ""PLUSH"", S is in position 4 -> not allowed.

Similarly, ""PULSH"" is not a word.

Another word: ""SLUMP"" is invalid because of M.

I think among the candidates, ""SULKY"" and ""BULKS"" are good.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are avoiding duplicates for now.

I'll go with ""BULKS"" because it has common consonants and ends with S, which is a common pattern.

But let me check: ""BULKS"" is a valid word.

Alternatively, ""HULKS"" is also valid and uses H instead of B. H is a common letter.

But B is slightly more common than H? Actually, in English, H is more common than B.

According to some sources, the frequency order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... then C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, ...

So after eliminating the top ones, H is the next common that we haven't tested? We haven't tested H, D, L, U, P, etc.

In our candidates:
   ""SULKY"": has U, L, K, Y -> K and Y are less common.
   ""PUSHY"": has P, U, H, Y -> H and P are common.
   ""BULKS"": has B, U, L, K -> B and K are less common.

So ""PUSHY"" might be better because it has H and P, which are more common than B and K.

But we also have U and L in ""BULKS"", which are common.

But ""PUSHY"" has H and P, and U and Y.

We can also consider ""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> but no S? We must include S.

We must include S.

Another candidate: ""GUSSY"" has two S's and G and Y -> but duplicate S and G and Y are less common.

I think ""PUSHY"" is a good choice: 
   - S is in position 3 (new position)
   - It tests P, U, S, H, Y.

But note: we are testing Y, which might be a vowel. Since we have no vowels A,E,I,O, the word must have U or Y. We are testing both U and Y in this word.

If we get a hit on U or Y, that would be helpful.

Alternatively, we can choose a word without Y to avoid the less common letter? But we have to use the available letters.

I think ""PUSHY"" is acceptable.

But let me see if there is a word that includes D, which is common.

For example, ""SUDDS"" -> duplicate D and S? Not good.

""SPUD"": 4 letters.

""DUSTS"": D, U, S, T, S -> T is eliminated and duplicate S.

Not possible.

""PUDUS"" not common.

So I think we should go with ""PUSHY"".

But wait, in ""PUSHY"", S is in position 3. We know that the secret word has S but not in position 4. We don't know about position 3.

Alternatively, we can choose a word with S in position 1 and include D: ""SUSED"" -> not a word.

""SHADY"" has A.

I think we have to pick from the candidates.

Another idea: ""LUSUS"" not a word.

I'll go with ""PUSHY"".

But note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""PUSHY"" is a valid word (meaning aggressive or forward).

So let's choose ""PUSHY"".

But wait, we have another candidate: ""SULKS"" (S, U, L, K, S) but duplicate S. We want to avoid duplicates to test more letters.

Similarly, ""BULKS"" is without duplicate.

But ""BULKS"" has B and K, which are less common.

Alternatively, ""HUSKY"": H, U, S, K, Y -> but S is in position 3? H-U-S-K-Y, so S is in position 3. And it has H, U, K, Y. And ""HUSKY"" is a word.

But we already have ""PUSHY"" and ""HUSKY"" is similar.

Now, between ""PUSHY"" and ""HUSKY"", which one? 
   ""PUSHY"": P, U, S, H, Y
   ""HUSKY"": H, U, S, K, Y

They both have U, S, Y and either P or H and K? Actually, ""HUSKY"" has H and K, and ""PUSHY"" has P and H.

We haven't tested H, P, or K.

But H is more common than P and K.

So ""HUSKY"" has H and K, and ""PUSHY"" has P and H.

I think both are acceptable.

But note: we are trying to find the position of S. In both, S is in position 3. So we are testing the same position.

We might as well choose one.

I'll choose ""HUSKY"" because it has H which is common.

But wait, we have a candidate with L: ""SULKY"" (S, U, L, K, Y) -> S in position 1, and L is common.

""SULKY"" has L, which is more common than K and Y.

In ""SULKY"": 
   Position 1: S (we are testing if S is in position 1)
   Position 2: U
   Position 3: L
   Position 4: K
   Position 5: Y

We know S is in the word, but not in position 4. We are testing position 1.

Also, L is a common letter that we haven't tested.

So ""SULKY"" might be better because it tests S in a new position (1) and includes L.

Similarly, ""HUSKY"" tests S in position 3.

We don't have any information about position 1, so it's good to test.

I think I'll go with ""SULKY"".

So the next guess is ""SULKY"".

But let me confirm the letters: S, U, L, K, Y. None of these are eliminated? 
   Eliminated: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T -> none of S,U,L,K,Y are in that list. So yes.

And it's a valid word.

So <guess>sulky</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗). This eliminates these 5 letters.
- **Guess 2: ""moist""** → Only ""S"" is present but in the wrong position (-). Letters M, O, I, T are absent (✗). This eliminates 4 additional letters (M, O, I, T) and confirms ""S"" is in the word but not in position 4.

**Key insights:**
- The secret word contains ""S"" (not in position 4) and excludes: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T (9 letters eliminated).
- Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- ""S"" must be included in the next guess but cannot be in position 4 (index 3, 0-based).
- Focus on testing high-frequency remaining letters (e.g., L, U, H, P, D) and vowels (U, Y, as A, E, I, O are eliminated).

**Strategy for Guess 3:**
- Choose a word with ""S"" in a new position (not 4) and maximize coverage of untested common letters.
- Avoid eliminated letters and prioritize distinct letters to test more possibilities.
- Candidate words considered: 
  - ""SULKY"" (S in position 1, tests U, L, K, Y).
  - ""PUSHY"" (S in position 3, tests P, U, H, Y).
  - ""HUSKY"" (S in position 3, tests H, U, K, Y).
  - ""BULKS"" (S in position 5, tests B, U, L, K).
- **Selected ""SULKY""** because:
  - Places ""S"" in position 1 (untested position, since position 4 is invalid).
  - Tests 4 new high-value letters: U (common vowel), L (high-frequency consonant), K, and Y (vowel substitute).
  - Uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.
  - Valid 5-letter word that avoids all eliminated letters.

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.\n Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.\n I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.\n\n So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as ""x"", meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.\n This means the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n Since we have eliminated these letters, we need a new starting word that avoids these letters and uses other common letters.\n\n Common Vowels: We have eliminated A, E. Remaining vowels: I, O, U (and sometimes Y).\n Common Consonants: We have eliminated C, R, N. We still have many others like S, T, L, D, M, etc.\n\n We should choose a word that uses letters that are common and avoids the eliminated ones.\n\n Let\'s try to think of a word that has:\n - Vowels: O and/or U (or Y) and/or I\n - Consonants: S, T, L, D, H, M, P, etc.\n\n Since A and E are eliminated, avoid words containing those letters.\n\n Possible words: \n   We might try words like ""MOIST"", ""PIOUS"", ""BUOYS"", but note we need 5 letters and avoid A,E,R,N,C.\n\n However, note that ""CRANE"" had R and N which are also eliminated, so we must avoid R,A,N,E,C.\n\n Let\'s look for a word without A,E,R,N,C and with common letters from the rest.\n\n Some top letters to include: S, T, L, O, I, M, P, U, etc.\n\n Example: \n   ""SPLIT"" : S, P, L, I, T -> avoids the eliminated letters? S (ok), P (ok), L (ok), I (ok), T (ok). \n   ""MOUTH"": M, O, U, T, H -> avoids A,E,R,N,C.\n\n Another common start is ""ADIEU"", but it has A and E, so eliminated.\n\n Let me try ""SLOTH"": S, L, O, T, H -> avoids eliminated letters? Yes.\n\n Alternatively, ""PIOUS"": P, I, O, U, S -> avoids eliminated letters.\n\n But note: we want to cover as many new common letters as possible. \n\n Considering frequency in English:\n   After E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, we have eliminated A, E, R, N. So next are T, O, I, S, H.\n\n So ""TOILS"" or ""SHOUT"" might be good.\n\n However, we also note that we have eliminated C,R,A,N,E.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that uses T, O, I, S, L which are common and avoid the banned letters.\n\n I\'ll choose ""OIL"": but ""OIL"" is 3 letters, we need 5.\n\n One good candidate: ""BOILS"" ? but ""B"" is also a good letter to test. And ""BOILS"" has B, O, I, L, S. \n But note: we don\'t know about B yet. Let me check if ""BOILS"" has any eliminated letter: B (ok), O (ok), I (ok), L (ok), S (ok). \n\n But wait, we don\'t have feedback on B. However, we want to test other common letters.\n\n Alternatively, ""TOUCH"": but ""TOUCH"" has C and H? C is eliminated. So avoid.\n\n Since C is eliminated, we cannot use C.\n\n Let me avoid: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n So try ""BOILS"": B, O, I, L, S -> all these are new and not eliminated.\n\n We can also consider ""MOULD"": M, O, U, L, D -> D is also a common letter? \n\n But note: we might want to use a word that has letters that are more common.\n\n I think ""SLIPT"" (an alternative spelling of ""slipped"" but archaic; might not be recognized) -> avoid non-common words.\n\n Another common word: ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D -> but wait, N was eliminated! We cannot use N.\n\n So avoid N: because we had N in ""crane"" and it was wrong.\n\n Therefore, our word must not contain C, R, A, N, E.\n\n Our candidate words:\n   ""BOILS"": avoids these letters: B,O,I,L,S -> suitable.\n   ""SPLIT"": S,P,L,I,T -> avoids eliminated letters? C,R,A,N,E: no S,P,L,I,T -> good.\n\n Let me choose ""SPLIT"" because it includes T and P, which are common.\n\n But note: ""BOILS"" has B and O, and ""SPLIT"" has S, P, L, I, T.\n\n Since we have eliminated 5 letters, we have to make sure we cover new ones.\n\n Another word: ""SMITH"": S,M,I,T,H -> avoids eliminated letters? No A,E,R,N,C -> good.\n\n But ""SMITH"" has H which is less common than T, S, P? \n\n Another option: ""PLUSH"": P,L,U,S,H -> avoids eliminated letters? Yes, but has H and U.\n\n We want to maximize information. \n\n Considering frequency of letters in English 5-letter words: \n   After A,E,R,O,I,L,S,T,N,U we have eliminated A,E,R,N. So remaining top: O,I,S,T,L,U.\n\n I think ""TOILS"" would be good: T,O,I,L,S -> avoids A,E,R,N,C. And it has common letters.\n\n But wait, is ""TOILS"" a valid word? Yes, meaning tasks. \n\n However, note that we are not using B, P, etc. But that\'s okay because we can get information on other letters.\n\n Alternatively, ""BOYSY"" is not valid.\n\n Let me pick ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S.\n\n But note: we have not tested B, D, M, P, U, etc. But we can only use 5 letters.\n\n We can try to cover as many as possible: \n   With 5 letters, we can cover 5.\n\n I\'ll decide to go with ""POUND"" ... wait, ""POUND"" has N? No! N is eliminated. So avoid ""POUND"".\n\n Then, maybe ""BUOYS"": B, U, O, Y, S -> avoids A,E,R,N,C. And Y is a vowel sometimes. ""BUOYS"" is a valid word.\n\n So let me compare:\n   ""BOILS"": letters [B, O, I, L, S]\n   ""BUOYS"": [B, U, O, Y, S] -> introduces U and Y, which we haven\'t tried. But we also get S and O.\n\n Alternatively, ""LOUSY"": L, O, U, S, Y -> valid.\n\n Which one is better? \n\n How about we try a word that has a different vowel? In ""crane"" we had A and E (both vowels), now we want to test O, U, I, etc.\n\n Since A and E are out, we should test O, I, U, and Y if possible.\n\n I think ""LOUSY"": L, O, U, S, Y. This word has L,O,U,S,Y -> avoids the eliminated letters.\n\n ""LOUSY"" also includes two vowels (O, U) and sometimes Y. \n\n But we haven\'t tested I? We can leave that for later.\n\n Alternatively, if we use ""BOILS"", we get O and I. \n\n We might have to choose arbitrarily.\n\n Let me decide to pick ""BUOYS"" because it uses B, U, O, Y, S.\n\n But note: we are on the second guess and we can always adjust later. \n\n However, I recall that ""SLATE"" is a common first word but we cannot use it because of A and E. \n\n Since we need to avoid A,E,R,N,C, and we want to test more letters, I think ""BOUSY"" is not a word.\n\n I think ""BUOYS"" is valid. \n\n But let me think of letter frequencies: \n   The most frequent letters excluding A,E,R,N: O,I,S,T,L,D,M,U,P,B,G,...\n\n We should prioritize letters that are more frequent.\n\n I think ""MOIST"" would be a good word: M, O, I, S, T -> avoids eliminated letters? Check: M (ok), O (ok), I (ok), S (ok), T (ok). Yes.\n\n ""MOIST"" is a common word.\n\n Why did I not think of ""MOIST""? It has M, O, I, S, T.\n\n So I will choose ""MOIST"".\n\n Let\'s go with ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T.\n\n We hope to get some hits.\n\n The guess is ""moist"".\n\n<guess>moist</guess>The first guess was ""crane"" and the feedback showed that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, we must choose a word that avoids these letters and uses other common letters to maximize information gain. Common vowels remaining are I, O, U, and sometimes Y, while common consonants include S, T, L, M, P, B, D, and others. \n\nA strong second guess should:\n- Exclude C, R, A, N, E\n- Include high-frequency letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, O, I)\n- Cover multiple new vowels/consonants\n\nAfter considering options like ""BOILS"" (B,O,I,L,S) and ""BUOYS"" (B,U,O,Y,S), ""MOIST"" (M,O,I,S,T) was selected because:\n- It avoids all eliminated letters (C,R,A,N,E)\n- It tests five new common letters: M, O, I, S, T\n- O and I are high-frequency vowels; S and T are high-frequency consonants\n- ""MOIST"" is a valid English word accepted in Wordle\n\n<guess>moist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\n1. ""crane"" -> all letters are incorrect: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So the secret word has none of these letters.\n\n2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(x), S(-), T(x). \n   This means:\n      - S is in the word but in the wrong position (since it\'s marked with \'-\')\n      - M, O, I, T are not in the word at all.\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position (since in ""moist"" it was the 4th letter and it\'s wrong position).\n- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.\n\nWe have eliminated 10 letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.\n\nWe also know that S is present, so we must include S in our next guess, but not in the 4th position.\n\nNow, what letters are left? We have to consider the remaining letters of the alphabet.\n\nThe entire alphabet: A to Z.\nEliminated: A, C, E, I, M, N, O, R, T.\n\nSo remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: S is in the word, so we know at least one S is present. However, we don\'t know if there are more than one S? But the feedback for ""moist"" only showed one S, and it was in the wrong position. But it could be that there is only one S, or if there are two, the other one wasn\'t in the guess.\n\nWe must form a 5-letter word that:\n- Contains S (at least one, and not in the 4th position)\n- Uses only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and note S is allowed, but we have to place it in a position that is not 4).\n\nWe also want to test as many new common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters among the remaining: \n  S (we already know is present, but we need to find its position), \n  then L, U, D, P, H, G, B, etc.\n\nWe should avoid using letters that are very rare (like Q, Z, X, J) if possible, to maximize the chance of hitting.\n\nPossible words:\n\nWe need to place S in one of the positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since position 4 is not allowed for S in this guess because we know it\'s wrong there, but note: the word might have S in multiple positions? However, we don\'t know. But we must avoid putting S in position 4).\n\nLet\'s think of words that have S in position 1, 2, 3, or 5, and use other letters from the remaining set.\n\nExamples:\n\n- S in position 1: \n   Words: SLYLY? (but has Y and L, but SLYLY is not common and has duplicate letters? Also, we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates, but we don\'t have evidence. We should avoid duplicates for now to test more letters.)\n   Better: SHULY? Not a word. \n   How about ""SLUMP"": S, L, U, M, P -> but M is eliminated! We cannot use M.\n\nWe must avoid eliminated letters: M is eliminated.\n\nSo: \n   S in position 1: \n      Next letters: from B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but S is already used, so we can use others, but we can use S again? but we don\'t want to waste a letter slot if we can test a new one).\n\n   Let me try to form a word: ""SLUSH"": S, L, U, S, H -> has two S\'s. But we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s. Also, H is allowed. But we are using S twice, which might not be efficient.\n\n   ""SPLIT"": but P and L are allowed, but I and T are eliminated -> not allowed.\n\n   ""SKULK"": S, K, U, L, K -> K and U and L are allowed, but has two K\'s? And ""SKULK"" is a word.\n\n   But we have eliminated I and T, so we cannot use them.\n\n   Another: ""SHOWY"": S, H, O, W, Y -> but O is eliminated! O is in the eliminated list.\n\n   We must avoid O.\n\n   So: ""SHULK"": S, H, U, L, K -> valid word? Not common. ""SHULK"" is not a standard word. \n\n   ""SHADY"": S, H, A, D, Y -> but A is eliminated.\n\n   We must avoid A.\n\n   ""SPUD"": only 4 letters.\n\n   ""SPUDS"": S, P, U, D, S -> 5 letters, but ends with S. And has two S\'s. But ""SPUDS"" is a word.\n\n   But we are using S twice, so we only test 4 distinct letters: S, P, U, D.\n\n   Alternatively, ""SUSUS"" is not a word.\n\n   ""SULKS"": S, U, L, K, S -> two S\'s.\n\n   We might have to use a word with duplicate S if we can\'t find one without.\n\n   But let\'s try without duplicate: ""SURLY"": S, U, R, L, Y -> but R is eliminated! R is in the eliminated list.\n\n   So we cannot use R.\n\n   ""SULKY"": S, U, L, K, Y -> all letters are allowed? S, U, L, K, Y. And ""SULKY"" is a word. It has no duplicates and uses new letters.\n\n   So ""SULKY"" is a candidate.\n\n- S in position 2:\n   Words: ""USUAL"" -> U, S, U, A, L -> but A is eliminated and duplicate U? Also, ""USUAL"" has A which is eliminated.\n   ""PSYCH"": P, S, Y, C, H -> but C is eliminated.\n   ""BSKDS"" not a word.\n\n   ""ASKED"": A and E eliminated.\n\n   Hard to find. Let\'s skip for now.\n\n- S in position 3:\n   Words: ""BUSKS"": B, U, S, K, S -> two S\'s, and we have B, U, K. But duplicate S.\n   ""FUSED"": F, U, S, E, D -> E eliminated.\n   ""GUSSY"": G, U, S, S, Y -> two S\'s.\n\n   ""PUSHY"": P, U, S, H, Y -> all allowed? P, U, S, H, Y. And ""PUSHY"" is a word. But S is in position 3, which is new.\n\n   So ""PUSHY"" is a candidate.\n\n- S in position 5:\n   Words: ""_____S"" -> ending with S.\n   ""PULPS"": P, U, L, P, S -> duplicate P? ""PULPS"" is a word, but duplicate P and we don\'t know if P is duplicated in the secret word.\n   ""DUMPY"": D, U, M, P, Y -> M eliminated.\n   ""BUGS"": only 4 letters.\n\n   ""FUDGY"": F, U, D, G, Y -> no S? We need to include S.\n\n   We need the word to end with S: ""LUMPS"": L, U, M, P, S -> M eliminated.\n   ""PUMPS"": P, U, M, P, S -> M eliminated.\n\n   ""BULKS"": B, U, L, K, S -> all allowed? B, U, L, K, S. And ""BULKS"" is a word. So candidate: ""BULKS"".\n\n   ""HULKS"": H, U, L, K, S -> also valid.\n\n   ""PUDUS"" -> not common.\n\nSo we have several candidates:\n   - S in position 1: ""SULKY"" (S, U, L, K, Y)\n   - S in position 3: ""PUSHY"" (P, U, S, H, Y)\n   - S in position 5: ""BULKS"" (B, U, L, K, S) or ""HULKS"" (H, U, L, K, S)\n\nWe want to choose a word that tests new letters and has common letters.\n\nNote: We know S is in the word, so we are going to get information about its position. We also want to test other letters that are common.\n\nAmong the remaining letters, the most common in English are L, U, D, P, H, G, B, etc.\n\nWe have two candidates that use U and L: ""SULKY"", ""BULKS"", ""HULKS"", and ""PUSHY"" uses U and H.\n\nWe also have Y in ""SULKY"" and ""PUSHY"", which is less common.\n\nBut note: we have eliminated many vowels (A, E, I, O) so U is the only vowel left that we haven\'t tested? We tested O and I in ""moist"" and they are absent, and A and E from ""crane"". So the word must have U? Not necessarily, because there might be Y acting as vowel, or no other vowel? But every word must have at least one vowel. The remaining vowels are U and Y (and sometimes W, but rare). So it\'s very likely that the word has U or Y.\n\nWe already know S is present, and we are including U in all our candidates. We are also testing Y in some.\n\nBut we don\'t know if U is in the word? We haven\'t tested U yet. So we should test U.\n\nSimilarly, we haven\'t tested L, K, H, P, B, etc.\n\nSo all candidates test U and S (which we know is present) and then other letters.\n\nWe want to maximize the number of new letters we test.\n\nIn ""SULKY"": letters S, U, L, K, Y -> 5 distinct letters, all new except S.\nIn ""PUSHY"": P, U, S, H, Y -> 5 distinct, new except S.\nIn ""BULKS"": B, U, L, K, S -> 5 distinct, new except S.\nIn ""HULKS"": H, U, L, K, S -> same as BULKS but with H instead of B.\n\nWe don\'t know which of these letters are in the word, so any is fine.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters, and all these do.\n\nWe might choose the one that uses the most common letters. Among the remaining, L, U, and P are more common than K, Y, H, B.\n\nBut we don\'t have frequency data at hand.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has S in a position we haven\'t tried. We tried S in position 4 (in ""moist"") and it was wrong. Now we are trying in position 1, 3, or 5.\n\nWe don\'t have information about position 1,2,3,5 for S.\n\nBut note: we have to place S in a position that is not 4. We can choose any of the others.\n\nI think ""BULKS"" is a good candidate because it uses B, U, L, K, S. It has S at the end, which is a common position.\n\nBut let me see if there\'s a word that uses more common letters. For example, with P and L.\n\nWhat about ""PLUSH""? P, L, U, S, H -> but S is in position 4? We cannot put S in position 4 because we know it\'s not there (from the feedback of ""moist"", the S was in position 4 and it was wrong, meaning the S is not in position 4). So we must avoid position 4 for S.\n\nIn ""PLUSH"", S is in position 4 -> not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, ""PULSH"" is not a word.\n\nAnother word: ""SLUMP"" is invalid because of M.\n\nI think among the candidates, ""SULKY"" and ""BULKS"" are good.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know. But we are avoiding duplicates for now.\n\nI\'ll go with ""BULKS"" because it has common consonants and ends with S, which is a common pattern.\n\nBut let me check: ""BULKS"" is a valid word.\n\nAlternatively, ""HULKS"" is also valid and uses H instead of B. H is a common letter.\n\nBut B is slightly more common than H? Actually, in English, H is more common than B.\n\nAccording to some sources, the frequency order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... then C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, ...\n\nSo after eliminating the top ones, H is the next common that we haven\'t tested? We haven\'t tested H, D, L, U, P, etc.\n\nIn our candidates:\n   ""SULKY"": has U, L, K, Y -> K and Y are less common.\n   ""PUSHY"": has P, U, H, Y -> H and P are common.\n   ""BULKS"": has B, U, L, K -> B and K are less common.\n\nSo ""PUSHY"" might be better because it has H and P, which are more common than B and K.\n\nBut we also have U and L in ""BULKS"", which are common.\n\nBut ""PUSHY"" has H and P, and U and Y.\n\nWe can also consider ""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> but no S? We must include S.\n\nWe must include S.\n\nAnother candidate: ""GUSSY"" has two S\'s and G and Y -> but duplicate S and G and Y are less common.\n\nI think ""PUSHY"" is a good choice: \n   - S is in position 3 (new position)\n   - It tests P, U, S, H, Y.\n\nBut note: we are testing Y, which might be a vowel. Since we have no vowels A,E,I,O, the word must have U or Y. We are testing both U and Y in this word.\n\nIf we get a hit on U or Y, that would be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word without Y to avoid the less common letter? But we have to use the available letters.\n\nI think ""PUSHY"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that includes D, which is common.\n\nFor example, ""SUDDS"" -> duplicate D and S? Not good.\n\n""SPUD"": 4 letters.\n\n""DUSTS"": D, U, S, T, S -> T is eliminated and duplicate S.\n\nNot possible.\n\n""PUDUS"" not common.\n\nSo I think we should go with ""PUSHY"".\n\nBut wait, in ""PUSHY"", S is in position 3. We know that the secret word has S but not in position 4. We don\'t know about position 3.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word with S in position 1 and include D: ""SUSED"" -> not a word.\n\n""SHADY"" has A.\n\nI think we have to pick from the candidates.\n\nAnother idea: ""LUSUS"" not a word.\n\nI\'ll go with ""PUSHY"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""PUSHY"" is a valid word (meaning aggressive or forward).\n\nSo let\'s choose ""PUSHY"".\n\nBut wait, we have another candidate: ""SULKS"" (S, U, L, K, S) but duplicate S. We want to avoid duplicates to test more letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""BULKS"" is without duplicate.\n\nBut ""BULKS"" has B and K, which are less common.\n\nAlternatively, ""HUSKY"": H, U, S, K, Y -> but S is in position 3? H-U-S-K-Y, so S is in position 3. And it has H, U, K, Y. And ""HUSKY"" is a word.\n\nBut we already have ""PUSHY"" and ""HUSKY"" is similar.\n\nNow, between ""PUSHY"" and ""HUSKY"", which one? \n   ""PUSHY"": P, U, S, H, Y\n   ""HUSKY"": H, U, S, K, Y\n\nThey both have U, S, Y and either P or H and K? Actually, ""HUSKY"" has H and K, and ""PUSHY"" has P and H.\n\nWe haven\'t tested H, P, or K.\n\nBut H is more common than P and K.\n\nSo ""HUSKY"" has H and K, and ""PUSHY"" has P and H.\n\nI think both are acceptable.\n\nBut note: we are trying to find the position of S. In both, S is in position 3. So we are testing the same position.\n\nWe might as well choose one.\n\nI\'ll choose ""HUSKY"" because it has H which is common.\n\nBut wait, we have a candidate with L: ""SULKY"" (S, U, L, K, Y) -> S in position 1, and L is common.\n\n""SULKY"" has L, which is more common than K and Y.\n\nIn ""SULKY"": \n   Position 1: S (we are testing if S is in position 1)\n   Position 2: U\n   Position 3: L\n   Position 4: K\n   Position 5: Y\n\nWe know S is in the word, but not in position 4. We are testing position 1.\n\nAlso, L is a common letter that we haven\'t tested.\n\nSo ""SULKY"" might be better because it tests S in a new position (1) and includes L.\n\nSimilarly, ""HUSKY"" tests S in position 3.\n\nWe don\'t have any information about position 1, so it\'s good to test.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""SULKY"".\n\nSo the next guess is ""SULKY"".\n\nBut let me confirm the letters: S, U, L, K, Y. None of these are eliminated? \n   Eliminated: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T -> none of S,U,L,K,Y are in that list.

We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x): None of these letters are in the secret word.
2. ""moist"" → M(x), O(x), I(x), S(-), T(x): S is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was the 4th letter and got ""-""). M, O, I, T are not in the word.
3. ""sulky"" → S(✓), U(-), L(-), K(-), Y(x): 
   - S is correct and in the right position (position 1).
   - U is in the word but not in position 2.
   - L is in the word but not in position 3.
   - K is in the word but not in position 4.
   - Y is not in the word.

From this, we know:
- The secret word starts with S (since S is correct and in position 1).
- The word contains U, L, and K, but not in the positions guessed (U not in 2, L not in 3, K not in 4).
- Y is not in the word, and we have other eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, Y (from previous feedback).
- Letters in the word: S (position 1), U, L, K.

We also know the word does not have: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, Y.

Since S is fixed at position 1, the word is of the form: S _ _ _ _

We must place U, L, K in the remaining positions (2,3,4,5) but not in their previously guessed positions:
- U cannot be in position 2 (but can be in 3,4,5)
- L cannot be in position 3 (but can be in 2,4,5)
- K cannot be in position 4 (but can be in 2,3,5)

Additionally, we have one more letter to find (since it's a 5-letter word, and we have S,U,L,K — so four letters — meaning we need one more distinct letter? Or could there be duplicates? We don't know, but we haven't seen duplicates so far.

However, note that we only know of U, L, K being present, but they might not be the only letters. The secret word has five letters: one is S at position 1, and the other four positions must be filled with letters including U, L, K and one more letter (since U, L, K are distinct and S is already at position 1). But it's also possible that one of them is repeated? Currently, no feedback suggests duplicates.

But to be safe, we should consider that the fifth letter is a new letter.

Moreover, the positions: we have to assign U, L, K to positions 2,3,4,5 without them being in their forbidden positions.

The remaining positions: 
- Position 2: available for L, K, or a new letter? But we must include U, L, K in the word. So position 2 must be one of U, L, K (with restrictions), but U cannot be in 2? Wait, U cannot be in position 2? From guess3: U was in position 2 and was marked ""-"", meaning U is in the word but should not be in position 2. So U must be in position 3,4, or5.

Similarly:
- L cannot be in position 3, so L can be in 2,4,5.
- K cannot be in position 4, so K can be in 2,3,5.

Let's list possible positions:

For U: position 3,4,5 (since not in 2)
For L: position 2,4,5 (since not in 3)
For K: position 2,3,5 (since not in 4)

The secret word: S _ _ _ _

We have to assign U, L, K to the four positions? But only three letters? Wait, we have three letters (U,L,K) for four positions? No: we have S in position 1, and then four slots, but we know the word must contain U, L, K (each at least once). So that leaves one slot for an additional letter? Or could one of these be duplicated? We don't know.

Alternatively, we know the word must contain exactly these four? Actually, we know S,U,L,K are in the word, so that accounts for four distinct letters. Therefore, the fifth letter is also in the word and we need to find it.

We must also determine which positions U, L, K occupy, and what the fifth letter is.

The fifth letter must be from the remaining possible letters: 
Eliminated letters: A,C,E,I,M,N,O,R,T,Y
Previously used: we have S,U,L,K (known to be present).
Remaining alphabet: B,D,F,G,H,J,P,Q,V,W,X,Z (and perhaps others, but we shouldn't use eliminated ones).

So possible fifth letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,P,Q,V,W,X,Z.

Now, we form a word that:
- Starts with S.
- Includes U, L, K.
- And one more letter from B,D,F,G,H,J,P,Q,V,W,X,Z.

And assigns U, L, K to positions (2-5) respecting their forbidden positions.

Moreover, the placements:
Let me denote:
Position 1: S
Position 2: cannot be U (because U must not be in position 2). So then position 2 can be: L, K, or the fifth letter.

But note: position 2 can be L (since L can be there) or K (since K can be there) or a new letter.

Similarly, position 3: cannot be L (so can be U, K, or fifth letter). Etc.

Given that, we can try to form words.

Let me list possible words that begin with S and have U,L,K in other positions.

The word must be a valid English word.

For example, consider having:

- Position 5: it can be U, L, K, or the fifth letter.

Idea: 
Since U, L, and K must be placed in positions 3,4,5 (for U), positions 2,4,5 (for L), and positions 2,3,5 (for K). 

Notice that position 2 is only available for L or K (or fifth letter). And we cannot put U in position 2.

Also, position 3: cannot have L -> so U or K or new letter.
Position 4: cannot have K -> so U or L or new letter.

But we must assign each of U,L,K to a distinct position.

Case: position 2 could be the fifth letter? Then U,L,K go to positions 3,4,5.

But then position 3: can be U or K (not L)
Position 4: can be U or L (not K)
Position 5: any of U,L,K.

So:
- If position 3 is U, position 4 must be L (since K can't be 4? But position 4 could be L? Then position 5 would be K? -> S _ U L K? But position 2 is fifth letter. So ""S x U L K"". That could be a word? E.g., ""SOULK"" no, but possible words: we need to check letters.

We need one new letter, say X (from remaining letters).

So candidate 1: S + X (fifth letter) + U + L + K? But position 3 is U, which is allowed? Position 4 is L -> but remember: from guess2, S was in the word and not in position 4. From guess3, K cannot be in position4. But here L is in position4: but wait, no problem because we don't have feedback on L in position4 yet. Also U is in position3: no feedback on that either.

So ""S X U L K"" -> positions: 
  1: S (ok)
  2: X (the fifth letter)
  3: U -> but wait, in guess3, U was in position2? Actually in this guess we are putting U in position3. 
  4: L -> L can be in position4? Yes, because the restriction for L was not in position3.
  5: K -> K can be in position5? Yes.

Now, is ""XULK"" a common suffix? We need to choose X such that whole word is valid.

Possible: 
   ""S H U L K"" -> SHULK? not a common word.
   ""S C U L K"" -> SCULK? but C is eliminated.
   ""S B U L K"" -> SBULK? not common.

Other options: 
   Position 4: we could put U? For example, S X U ? K? But if we put U in position4? 
   Then positions: 
      2: X
      3: ? for U we put it in position4: then position3 must be for K? -> so S X K U L? 
      But then positions: K in position3 -> allowed? Yes. U in position4 -> allowed? Yes. L in position5: allowed? Yes.

Word: S X K U L -> e.g., ""S K U L L"" but double L? ""SKULL"" -> but we have no double letters? Actually, we have L only once? Wait, ""SKULL"" has two L's? Yes, so if the word has double L, then we have an extra L, but we know there is only one L? Not necessarily: the feedback from guess3 showed L in position3 was wrong, but it didn't say if there are multiples. So we don't know.

But ""SKULL"" has two L's. But in our word, if we put L only in position5, that's fine. But ""S K U L L"" would be 6 letters? No, SKULL is S,K,U,L,L? No, SKULL is S-K-U-L-L but that's 5 letters: positions 1=S, 2=K, 3=U, 4=L, 5=L? Wait, no: SKULL has only one L? Actually, SKULL: S-K-U-L-L? That's two L's? I think I'm confused.

Spelling of ""SKULL"": S, K, U, L, L? But that would be 5 letters: position 1=S, 2=K, 3=U, 4=L, 5=L? Then L is duplicated. But we haven't found any duplicate letters yet? So it's possible.

But in our case, from guess3, we know L is in the word, but not how many times? So ""SKULL"" would be acceptable if position2=K, position3=U, position4=L, position5=L. But we have to assign U, L, K. K is at position2? Okay. U at position3? Okay. But L at position4 and position5: but we only have one L? No, we need two L's? Then we are missing the K? Wait, no: in ""SKULL"", we have K and U and L (twice). But we only need U, L, K: K is present at position2, L at position4 and position5? That would be K and L, but we never assigned K? The word ""SKULL"" has K? So U is also present? Yes, in position3.

But we need to cover U, L, K: 
   U at position3: yes.
   L at positions 4 and 5: but we only have one L? Actually, two L's: but we don't care because we are assigning the positions. 

However, the feedback doesn't guarantee that there is only one U, L, or K. So we have to consider multiple occurrences.

But initially, we want to find a word that matches.

So back to candidate:

Let me try to list words starting with S and containing U, L, K.

Common words: 
   SKULK: S-K-U-L-K -> This has K twice? Let's think: positions: 1=S, 2=K, 3=U, 4=L, 5=K -> so K at position2 and position5. Then U at position3, L at position4. 
   Now, we have two K's? Yes. But in this word, U is at position3: that's allowed? Yes, because U was only forbidden in position2. Similarly, L at position4: allowed? Yes, L forbidden only in position3. K at position2: allowed? Yes, K forbidden only in position4. And K at position5? Yes, no problem. But we have U,L,K covered? Yes: U at3, L at4, K at2 and5. 

But is ""SKULK"" a valid word? Yes, meaning to hide or move stealthily.

However, we have duplicate K? That's fine.

Also, we have one extra K? Not extra, but we are including U,L,K.

In this case, the fifth letter is essentially the same K? But let's see the feedback for position: 
   Position1: S (correct)
   Position2: K? That would be marked: since K is in the word, but we don't know position yet? In guess3, K was in position4 and it was marked '-', meaning K is in the word but not position4. But if K is in position2, that is different? 
   So it would be okay.

But ""SKULK"" uses only S,K,U,L. So no fifth letter? Exactly: we have letters: S, K, U, L — and K repeated. So we don't need an additional letter? 

Yes, because U, L, K are all included. Also, the word is 5 letters: S-K-U-L-K.

Now, check restrictions:
   Position2: K -> K can be in position2? Yes? 
   Position3: U -> U can be in position3? Yes (not forbidden)
   Position4: L -> L can be in position4? Yes (restricted only for position3)
   Position5: K -> K can be in position5? Yes.

Also, eliminated letters: only allowed letters are B,D,F,G,H,J,P,Q,V,W,X,Z for new letters? But SKULK doesn't have any new letter? It reuses K.

But we also haven't tested any new letter? That's okay? We are trying to see if this works.

Moreover, does it match the feedback? 
   Guess3: ""sulky"" -> S(ok) U(wrong position) L(wrong position) K(wrong position) Y(not)
   Then ""SKULK"": positions:
     S at1: same as before.
     U is at3: so if U was at position3? That would be shown as U in correct position? But in guess3, U was at position2 and was wrong. Now U at position3: that's possible.

So ""SKULK"" could be a candidate.

But let me see if there are other words.

Another word: ""SKULL"": S-K-U-L-L -> Here U is at position3? Position3=U -> same as before? But then L at position4 and position5? We have two L's? Then we need L? Yes, L is present. But we don't need K? Wait, ""SKULL"" has K? At position2? And U at3, L at4 and5? So letters: S, K, U, L — and L duplicated. So includes U,L,K? Yes: K and U and L.

But U, L, K are present: K at2, U at3, L at4 and5.

Restrictions: 
   Position2: K -> allowed? Yes.
   Position3: U -> allowed? Yes.
   Position4: L -> allowed? Yes.
   Position5: L -> but we haven't tested L at position5? 

Note: in guess3, L was at position3 and marked wrong. But if L is also at position5? That's fine because there could be duplicates? But in the secret word, maybe L is duplicated? 

But ""SKULL"" is a valid word.

Alternatively, ""SULKS"": S-U-L-K-S -> has S duplicated. But S is at position1, and then position5: so we need? Letters: S, U, L, K — covered? Yes.

Positions:
  1: S
  2: U -> but cannot put U at position2! From guess3, U cannot be at position2? That was given: U in position2 marked '-' meaning U is elsewhere? So if we put U in position2 again, it would be wrong? 

No: in new guess, if we put U at position2, and that's not the correct position, we get feedback '-' meaning U is still misplaced? But if we know U is not at position2, we shouldn't put it there? That might waste a turn? We can avoid.

Similarly, U must not be put at position2 because we know it's not there. Hence, ""SULKS"" is not good because U would be in position2.

So rule out that.

Thus, ""SKULK"" and ""SKULL"" are candidates, but note:

In ""SKULL"", position5=L which is not forbidden?

But we have another candidate: 
  ""BULKS"": but starts with B? Not S? Must start with S.

Now, back to ""SKULK"": how about the position for K? In ""SKULK"", K is at position2 and position5. Position2 for K: is that allowed? Yes, since the restriction for K is only not position4? And position5 is also acceptable? Yes.

But in the secret word, if it is ""SKULK"", then guess3: ""sulky"" would have shown:
   S(✓) U(-) L(-) K(-) Y(x) — which matches? 
   Actually, U was guessed at position2? In the secret word, U is at position3? So U is present? But position2 is not U? That's why U is ""in word"" but wrong position? Similarly L? In secret word, L is at position4? In guess, L was at position3? So yes. K at position4? In guess, K at position4? In secret word, K at positions2 and5? But at position4 in guess: secret has L at position4? So K was not at position4? So that's why K is ""in word"" but not correct at position4.

Then ""sulky"" got K marked '-' meaning K is in the word but not position4? That doesn't say whether K is at position2? But if there is K at position2 and position5, then K is in the word? So yes, it should be '-'. 

Therefore, SKULK is possible? Also, SKULL? 

In SKULL: positions: 
  1=S, 2=K, 3=U, 4=L, 5=L? 

Then guess3: ""sulky"": 
   position1: S (✓)
   position2: U vs K? In secret, position2 is K? so U not there? So U in word? at position3? so '-' for U? 
   position3: L vs U? In secret, position3 is U? Now we have L at position3? But secret has U? so L not at position3? 
   position4: K vs L? In secret, position4 is L? The secret has L at4? So K not at4? 
   position5: Y vs L? Secret has L? So Y not? So feedback would be S(✓) U(-) L(-) K(-) Y(x) — same as given? Yes.

Thus, both ""SKULK"" and ""SKULL"" are possible.

But also, we need to consider words with a fifth letter? For example:
   S H U L K? not valid word.
   S L U K ?: ""SLUKS""? not word.

With a fifth letter, for instance:

Place the fifth letter in position2: so ""S x y z w"", where x is fifth letter, then U,L,K in 3,4,5? But position3 must not be L? So position3: U or K? Position4: U or L? Avoid K? Position5: any.

Example: S F U L K? Not valid.

S P U L K? ""SPULK"" not common.

S D U L K? ""SDULK"" not.

Then, perhaps position5 is the fifth letter? And U,L,K in positions? 

For example: 
   Position2: L or K? Let's say position2: L? Then position3: U or K? Then position4: U or L? Avoid K? Position5: fifth letter.

So e.g.: 
   S L U K x? Where x is fifth letter? But K at position4? Cannot put K at position4? 
   Alternatively: S L K U x? Then positions: 
      position1: S
      position2: L -> allowed? Yes? Because L can be in position2? 
      position3: K -> allowed? Yes? 
      position4: U -> allowed? Yes? 
      position5: x = fifth letter.

Now, word: S L K U x? For example, ""SLK U?"" -> not easy? ""SLUKS""? Not valid? 

""SLUCK"": S-L-U-C-K? C eliminated? Not valid? 

We need to find valid words.

Maybe ""SLUBS"": S-L-U-B-S -> but B is allowed? And S duplicated? But is it valid? ""SLUBS""? Yes, deposits? But S duplicated? Also, ""SLUBS"": S at1 and5? And letters S,L,U,B? But B is new? So U,L,K? Where is K? K is not in? So ""SLUBS"" doesn't have K? But we must include K? 

That's the problem: we must include U, L, K? So words without K are invalid? 

Similarly, we must include them.

Another candidate: ""SKULP""? Not common word.

Perhaps we avoid duplicates and consider SKULK or SKULL.

But SKULL has L duplicated? SKULK has K duplicated? 

What about ""SUCK"": only 4 letters? Not 5.

""SKIP"": 4 letters? 

So maybe the word is ""SKULK"" or ""SKULL"".

But guess3 had L in position3 and feedback: L(-). In SKULL, at position3 is U? So L is at position4 and5? So the L at position3 in guess was incorrect? So '-' in feedback? Correct? 

Similarly for U: in guess3 at position2? But not there? So '-' is correct? 

And for K: at position4? But in SKULL, position4 is L? So K not at4? So '-' for K? Correct? 

And Y? Not? So both match the feedback.

So both words are possible? 

But we have to guess next? So let me think: 
   We also have to cover the possibility of a fifth letter? 

How about ""BULKS""? But it starts with B? Not S? We know position1=S? So ""BULKS"" is invalid as first letter not S.

Other words: 
   ""SAULK""? But A eliminated? 
   ""SHULK""? Not common.
   ""SPULK""? Not common.

There might be others? ""S K U L K"" and ""S K U L L"" only? 

But we have also ""SULK?"" -> incomplete?

Or ""S K U L ?"" : ""SKULP"" not valid? 

So possibly ""SKULK"" and ""SKULL"" are the only common words? 

Between these, how to choose? 

We could pick one? For instance, ""SKULK"" is less common? Or ""SKULL"" is more common? 

But also, we have not tested any new letter? So there is no clue? 

Alternatively, there might be other words with an additional letter? Let me look again.

Example: with H? 
   S H U L K -> not a word? 
   Or ""S K U L H""? Not meaningful?

Perhaps ""SLUMP"": but M eliminated? 

Or ""SLUBS"": doesn't have K? 

Idea: have U, L, K and one more letter? For example, ""S P U L K"": But we avoid it because not a word? Or ""SPULK"" is not accepted.

Maybe ""S K U M P"": but M eliminated? 

Another thought: perhaps the K at position4 is not a problem if we put it elsewhere? For example: 
   Position2: U cannot, so place L or K? 
   Position2: L? Then position3: cannot be L? So U or K? 
      Position3: U? Then position4: cannot be K? So must put L? But position4: L -> allowed? Then position5: we need to place K and the fifth letter? 

But wait, we have to place K? Position5: K -> then we get S L U L K? Double L? ""SLULK"" not a word? 

Position3: K? Then position4: cannot be K? So put U or L? 
   Position4: U? Then position5: L? ""S L K U L""? Again double L? ""SLKUL""? Not word? 
   Or position4: L? Then position5: U? ""S L K L U""? ""SLKLU""? Not word? 

Alternatively, position2: K? Then position3: U (allowed) and position4: cannot put K? So put L? Then position5: fifth letter? So ""S K U L ?"" 

Possible words: 
   ""SKUL ?"": 
        ""SKULE""? E eliminated? 
        ""SKUL J""? Not word?
        ""SKULP""? Not common? 
        ""SKUL F""? No? 

So perhaps ""SKULK"" and ""SKULL"" are the only options? 

Therefore, we should guess one of them? Since we have not guessed any word with L duplicated? Or K duplicated? But in the feedback, we don't have proof against duplicates? 

So let's choose ""SKULL"" because it's a common word? Or ""SKULK"" is less common? 

We have 6 guesses, so guess4? We can try ""SKULL"" or ""SKULK""? But let's think which one to test? 

Also, note: in SKULL, we have L at position4 and position5? And K at position2 and U at position3? 

But in the secret word, if it is ""SKULL"", then in our guess, we will get:
   S(✓) K(?) U(?) L(?) L(?) and the feedback will give positions? 

If it's different, we adjust? 

Alternatively, if we guess ""SKULL"", and it's wrong, we waste one? 

But we could guess a word that distinguishes? Not possible? 

Maybe there are other words? 

Another word: ""SULCI""? But I eliminated? 

Perhaps ""SULPH"": S-U-L-P-H? Here U at position2? But cannot put U at position2? -> feedback from guess3: U was at position2 and incorrect? So we shouldn't put U at position2? 

Moreover, H is allowed? But if we put U-L-P-H? But U must not be at position2? So ""SULPH"" has U at2? Not allowed? 

We must construct a word that avoids position2 for U? So U can only be at positions? 3,4,5.

Start with S, then position2: not U, and must be one of L,K or new letter.

For example, position2: H? Then position3: U? Like ""SHULK""? Not valid? 

Position2: D? ""SDU...""? Not easy? 

Let me consider ""SHULK"" — is it in the dictionary? I'm not sure? Some may accept? 

But officially, ""SHIRK"" would have I? 

I think it's better to go with ""SKULL"" as a common word? 

Therefore, we guess ""SKULL"".

But wait, the word must have K? And L? And U? 

For ""SKULL"": S(1), K(2), U(3), L(4), L(5)? 

Feedback for this guess: 
   Position1: ✓ = S
   Position2: K -> now, K is in the word? Not in position4? But if, for example, the secret is ""SKULK"", then K would be in position2? Correct? So ✓? 
   But we don't know? 

This guess will give feedback? 

Since we have no better idea, we guess ""SKULL""

<guess>skull</guess>

But let me confirm: 

Possible? 
   If the secret word is ""SKULL"", we get full match.
   If it is ""SKULK"", we get S(✓) K(✓) U(✓) L(-) L(?) but wait, ""SKULL"" has two L's? At4 and5? Secret ""SKULK"" has only one L? At position4, and K at5? 

Feedback: 
   For SKULL vs SKULK (secret):
     Position1: S✓
     Position2: K✓
     Position3: U✓
     Position4: L vs L? So ✓? 
     Position5: L vs K? So L is not K? Then: 
        L is in the word? But in SKULK, the letters are S,K,U,L,K -> so L is present? But we are at position5: secret has K? So we put L? So feedback for position5: L vs K? -> L is not there? But L is in the word? At position4? So since there is an L, and we put L at position5? So it should be '-' because L is in the word but not at position5? 

Actually, comparison SKULL? (guess) and SKULK (secret):
   S: g: correct
   K: g: K? Correct? 
   U: correct? 
   L: at position4? Guess and secret have L? At same position? Correct? 
   Position5: guess has L? Secret has K? So:
        The secret has L at position4? And guess put L at5? So the secret has L, but only at position4? So position5: L is not there? And L is in the word? But already matched? The secret has one L? So you might need to mark accordingly? 

But for position5: L is not in the secret at that position, and there is only one L in the secret (at position4)? And we haven't used it in feedback for position4? Actually, we'll mark:
   Position4: ✓ because same letter? 
   Position5: L in guess? Secret has K? So L is not at position5? And furthermore, how many L in secret? In SKULK, there is only one L? So at position5: since the secret's L has been counted at position4? Then this L at5 is extra? So should be x? Unless there is another L? 

Because the word SKULK has one L -> so at position5: L is not in the word? So x? 

So if secret is SKULK, guess: SKULL -> feedback: S(✓) K(✓) U(✓) L(✓) L(x) 

But wait, the L at position4 matches? So ✓? Then at position5: guess has L? Secret has K? And there isn't a second L? So x? 

Therefore, we would see four ✓ and one x? 

Similarly, if secret is SKULL, then we get all ✓. 

So with one guess, we differentiate? 

But for now, we guess to find out? 

But we are due to make a new guess? 

So I'll go with ""SKULL""? 

But note: if the secret is SKULK, then we are not done? And we will have to guess again? But we have guesses left.

Alternatively, if we guess ""SKULK"", and secret is SKULL? We get: 
   Guess: S,K,U,L,K
   Secret: S,K,U,L,L
   Feedback: 
      S✓ 
      K✓ 
      U✓ 
      L✓ 
      K vs L: L is at position4 in secret? But position5: guess has K, secret has L? 
         So K at position5: secret has L? And no more K? Because position2 K? So we used one K at position2? Then position5: this K is not? Because secret has L? So K is not at position5? And no second K? So x? 
      Thus: same as above? ✓,✓,✓,✓,x? 

So both guesses would get almost the same feedback? 

Therefore, it doesn't matter? But if we get back, we have information? 

But note: we have a fifth letter possibility? 

But for now, I think ""SKULL"" is more common?

So we guess ""SKULL"".

Let me box it.
</think>
The previous feedback provides critical clues:

1. **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗).
2. **Guess 2: ""moist""** → Only ""S"" is present but not in position 4 (-); M, O, I, T are absent (✗).
3. **Guess 3: ""sulky""** → 
   - ""S"" is correct and in position 1 (✓).
   - ""U"" is present but not in position 2 (-).
   - ""L"" is present but not in position 3 (-).
   - ""K"" is present but not in position 4 (-).
   - ""Y"" is absent (✗).

### Key Deductions:
- The word starts with **S** (from ""sulky"" ✓ feedback).
- **U, L, and K** are in the word but not in positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively (from ""-"" feedback).
- Letters **C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, Y** are eliminated (from ""✗"" feedback).
- Remaining possible letters: **B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z**.
- Only one position is unknown (positions 2–5 must contain U, L, K, and one new letter or a duplicate of existing letters).

### Constraints for Positions:
- Position 1: **S** (fixed).
- Position 2: Cannot be U (from feedback), so it must be L, K, or a new letter.
- Position 3: Cannot be L (from feedback), so it must be U, K, or a new letter.
- Position 4: Cannot be K (from feedback), so it must be U, L, or a new letter.
- Position 5: No restrictions.

### Strategy for This Guess:
- Prioritize words starting with ""S"" that include **U, L, K**.
- The word must conform to position constraints (e.g., U not in pos 2, L not in pos 3, K not in pos 4).
- Explore valid 5-letter words meeting these criteria from the remaining alphabet.
- Candidate words considered: ""SKULK"" (S-K-U-L-K) and ""SKULL"" (S-K-U-L-L). Both use allowed letters and fit position rules.
- Between these, **""SKULL""** is selected as it is a common word, and ""K"" is already known to not be in position 4.

### Next Steps:
- This guess tests whether the duplicates ""L/L"" or another configuration matches the secret word.
- Feedback will clarify positions of U, L, K and potential duplicates or new letters.

<guess>skull</guess>",skull,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x): None of these letters are in the secret word.
2. ""moist"" → M(x), O(x), I(x), S(-), T(x): S is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was the 4th letter and got ""-""). M, O, I, T are not in the word.
3. ""sulky"" → S(✓), U(-), L(-), K(-), Y(x): 
   - S is correct and in the right position (position 1).
   - U is in the word but not in position 2.
   - L is in the word but not in position 3.
   - K is in the word but not in position 4.
   - Y is not in the word.

From this, we know:
- The secret word starts with S (since S is correct and in position 1).
- The word contains U, L, and K, but not in the positions guessed (U not in 2, L not in 3, K not in 4).
- Y is not in the word, and we have other eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, Y (from previous feedback).
- Letters in the word: S (position 1), U, L, K.

We also know the word does not have: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, Y.

Since S is fixed at position 1, the word is of the form: S _ _ _ _

We must place U, L, K in the remaining positions (2,3,4,5) but not in their previously guessed positions:
- U cannot be in position 2 (but can be in 3,4,5)
- L cannot be in position 3 (but can be in 2,4,5)
- K cannot be in position 4 (but can be in 2,3,5)

Additionally, we have one more letter to find (since it's a 5-letter word, and we have S,U,L,K — so four letters — meaning we need one more distinct letter? Or could there be duplicates? We don't know, but we haven't seen duplicates so far.

However, note that we only know of U, L, K being present, but they might not be the only letters. The secret word has five letters: one is S at position 1, and the other four positions must be filled with letters including U, L, K and one more letter (since U, L, K are distinct and S is already at position 1). But it's also possible that one of them is repeated? Currently, no feedback suggests duplicates.

But to be safe, we should consider that the fifth letter is a new letter.

Moreover, the positions: we have to assign U, L, K to positions 2,3,4,5 without them being in their forbidden positions.

The remaining positions: 
- Position 2: available for L, K, or a new letter? But we must include U, L, K in the word. So position 2 must be one of U, L, K (with restrictions), but U cannot be in 2? Wait, U cannot be in position 2? From guess3: U was in position 2 and was marked ""-"", meaning U is in the word but should not be in position 2. So U must be in position 3,4, or5.

Similarly:
- L cannot be in position 3, so L can be in 2,4,5.
- K cannot be in position 4, so K can be in 2,3,5.

Let's list possible positions:

For U: position 3,4,5 (since not in 2)
For L: position 2,4,5 (since not in 3)
For K: position 2,3,5 (since not in 4)

The secret word: S _ _ _ _

We have to assign U, L, K to the four positions? But only three letters? Wait, we have three letters (U,L,K) for four positions? No: we have S in position 1, and then four slots, but we know the word must contain U, L, K (each at least once). So that leaves one slot for an additional letter? Or could one of these be duplicated? We don't know.

Alternatively, we know the word must contain exactly these four? Actually, we know S,U,L,K are in the word, so that accounts for four distinct letters. Therefore, the fifth letter is also in the word and we need to find it.

We must also determine which positions U, L, K occupy, and what the fifth letter is.

The fifth letter must be from the remaining possible letters: 
Eliminated letters: A,C,E,I,M,N,O,R,T,Y
Previously used: we have S,U,L,K (known to be present).
Remaining alphabet: B,D,F,G,H,J,P,Q,V,W,X,Z (and perhaps others, but we shouldn't use eliminated ones).

So possible fifth letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,P,Q,V,W,X,Z.

Now, we form a word that:
- Starts with S.
- Includes U, L, K.
- And one more letter from B,D,F,G,H,J,P,Q,V,W,X,Z.

And assigns U, L, K to positions (2-5) respecting their forbidden positions.

Moreover, the placements:
Let me denote:
Position 1: S
Position 2: cannot be U (because U must not be in position 2). So then position 2 can be: L, K, or the fifth letter.

But note: position 2 can be L (since L can be there) or K (since K can be there) or a new letter.

Similarly, position 3: cannot be L (so can be U, K, or fifth letter). Etc.

Given that, we can try to form words.

Let me list possible words that begin with S and have U,L,K in other positions.

The word must be a valid English word.

For example, consider having:

- Position 5: it can be U, L, K, or the fifth letter.

Idea: 
Since U, L, and K must be placed in positions 3,4,5 (for U), positions 2,4,5 (for L), and positions 2,3,5 (for K). 

Notice that position 2 is only available for L or K (or fifth letter). And we cannot put U in position 2.

Also, position 3: cannot have L -> so U or K or new letter.
Position 4: cannot have K -> so U or L or new letter.

But we must assign each of U,L,K to a distinct position.

Case: position 2 could be the fifth letter? Then U,L,K go to positions 3,4,5.

But then position 3: can be U or K (not L)
Position 4: can be U or L (not K)
Position 5: any of U,L,K.

So:
- If position 3 is U, position 4 must be L (since K can't be 4? But position 4 could be L? Then position 5 would be K? -> S _ U L K? But position 2 is fifth letter. So ""S x U L K"". That could be a word? E.g., ""SOULK"" no, but possible words: we need to check letters.

We need one new letter, say X (from remaining letters).

So candidate 1: S + X (fifth letter) + U + L + K? But position 3 is U, which is allowed? Position 4 is L -> but remember: from guess2, S was in the word and not in position 4. From guess3, K cannot be in position4. But here L is in position4: but wait, no problem because we don't have feedback on L in position4 yet. Also U is in position3: no feedback on that either.

So ""S X U L K"" -> positions: 
  1: S (ok)
  2: X (the fifth letter)
  3: U -> but wait, in guess3, U was in position2? Actually in this guess we are putting U in position3. 
  4: L -> L can be in position4? Yes, because the restriction for L was not in position3.
  5: K -> K can be in position5? Yes.

Now, is ""XULK"" a common suffix? We need to choose X such that whole word is valid.

Possible: 
   ""S H U L K"" -> SHULK? not a common word.
   ""S C U L K"" -> SCULK? but C is eliminated.
   ""S B U L K"" -> SBULK? not common.

Other options: 
   Position 4: we could put U? For example, S X U ? K? But if we put U in position4? 
   Then positions: 
      2: X
      3: ? for U we put it in position4: then position3 must be for K? -> so S X K U L? 
      But then positions: K in position3 -> allowed? Yes. U in position4 -> allowed? Yes. L in position5: allowed? Yes.

Word: S X K U L -> e.g., ""S K U L L"" but double L? ""SKULL"" -> but we have no double letters? Actually, we have L only once? Wait, ""SKULL"" has two L's? Yes, so if the word has double L, then we have an extra L, but we know there is only one L? Not necessarily: the feedback from guess3 showed L in position3 was wrong, but it didn't say if there are multiples. So we don't know.

But ""SKULL"" has two L's. But in our word, if we put L only in position5, that's fine. But ""S K U L L"" would be 6 letters? No, SKULL is S,K,U,L,L? No, SKULL is S-K-U-L-L but that's 5 letters: positions 1=S, 2=K, 3=U, 4=L, 5=L? Wait, no: SKULL has only one L? Actually, SKULL: S-K-U-L-L? That's two L's? I think I'm confused.

Spelling of ""SKULL"": S, K, U, L, L? But that would be 5 letters: position 1=S, 2=K, 3=U, 4=L, 5=L? Then L is duplicated. But we haven't found any duplicate letters yet? So it's possible.

But in our case, from guess3, we know L is in the word, but not how many times? So ""SKULL"" would be acceptable if position2=K, position3=U, position4=L, position5=L. But we have to assign U, L, K. K is at position2? Okay. U at position3? Okay. But L at position4 and position5: but we only have one L? No, we need two L's? Then we are missing the K? Wait, no: in ""SKULL"", we have K and U and L (twice). But we only need U, L, K: K is present at position2, L at position4 and position5? That would be K and L, but we never assigned K? The word ""SKULL"" has K? So U is also present? Yes, in position3.

But we need to cover U, L, K: 
   U at position3: yes.
   L at positions 4 and 5: but we only have one L? Actually, two L's: but we don't care because we are assigning the positions. 

However, the feedback doesn't guarantee that there is only one U, L, or K. So we have to consider multiple occurrences.

But initially, we want to find a word that matches.

So back to candidate:

Let me try to list words starting with S and containing U, L, K.

Common words: 
   SKULK: S-K-U-L-K -> This has K twice? Let's think: positions: 1=S, 2=K, 3=U, 4=L, 5=K -> so K at position2 and position5. Then U at position3, L at position4. 
   Now, we have two K's? Yes. But in this word, U is at position3: that's allowed? Yes, because U was only forbidden in position2. Similarly, L at position4: allowed? Yes, L forbidden only in position3. K at position2: allowed? Yes, K forbidden only in position4. And K at position5? Yes, no problem. But we have U,L,K covered? Yes: U at3, L at4, K at2 and5. 

But is ""SKULK"" a valid word? Yes, meaning to hide or move stealthily.

However, we have duplicate K? That's fine.

Also, we have one extra K? Not extra, but we are including U,L,K.

In this case, the fifth letter is essentially the same K? But let's see the feedback for position: 
   Position1: S (correct)
   Position2: K? That would be marked: since K is in the word, but we don't know position yet? In guess3, K was in position4 and it was marked '-', meaning K is in the word but not position4. But if K is in position2, that is different? 
   So it would be okay.

But ""SKULK"" uses only S,K,U,L. So no fifth letter? Exactly: we have letters: S, K, U, L — and K repeated. So we don't need an additional letter? 

Yes, because U, L, K are all included. Also, the word is 5 letters: S-K-U-L-K.

Now, check restrictions:
   Position2: K -> K can be in position2? Yes? 
   Position3: U -> U can be in position3? Yes (not forbidden)
   Position4: L -> L can be in position4? Yes (restricted only for position3)
   Position5: K -> K can be in position5? Yes.

Also, eliminated letters: only allowed letters are B,D,F,G,H,J,P,Q,V,W,X,Z for new letters? But SKULK doesn't have any new letter? It reuses K.

But we also haven't tested any new letter? That's okay? We are trying to see if this works.

Moreover, does it match the feedback? 
   Guess3: ""sulky"" -> S(ok) U(wrong position) L(wrong position) K(wrong position) Y(not)
   Then ""SKULK"": positions:
     S at1: same as before.
     U is at3: so if U was at position3? That would be shown as U in correct position? But in guess3, U was at position2 and was wrong. Now U at position3: that's possible.

So ""SKULK"" could be a candidate.

But let me see if there are other words.

Another word: ""SKULL"": S-K-U-L-L -> Here U is at position3? Position3=U -> same as before? But then L at position4 and position5? We have two L's? Then we need L? Yes, L is present. But we don't need K? Wait, ""SKULL"" has K? At position2? And U at3, L at4 and5? So letters: S, K, U, L — and L duplicated. So includes U,L,K? Yes: K and U and L.

But U, L, K are present: K at2, U at3, L at4 and5.

Restrictions: 
   Position2: K -> allowed? Yes.
   Position3: U -> allowed? Yes.
   Position4: L -> allowed? Yes.
   Position5: L -> but we haven't tested L at position5? 

Note: in guess3, L was at position3 and marked wrong. But if L is also at position5? That's fine because there could be duplicates? But in the secret word, maybe L is duplicated? 

But ""SKULL"" is a valid word.

Alternatively, ""SULKS"": S-U-L-K-S -> has S duplicated. But S is at position1, and then position5: so we need? Letters: S, U, L, K — covered? Yes.

Positions:
  1: S
  2: U -> but cannot put U at position2! From guess3, U cannot be at position2? That was given: U in position2 marked '-' meaning U is elsewhere? So if we put U in position2 again, it would be wrong? 

No: in new guess, if we put U at position2, and that's not the correct position, we get feedback '-' meaning U is still misplaced? But if we know U is not at position2, we shouldn't put it there? That might waste a turn? We can avoid.

Similarly, U must not be put at position2 because we know it's not there. Hence, ""SULKS"" is not good because U would be in position2.

So rule out that.

Thus, ""SKULK"" and ""SKULL"" are candidates, but note:

In ""SKULL"", position5=L which is not forbidden?

But we have another candidate: 
  ""BULKS"": but starts with B? Not S? Must start with S.

Now, back to ""SKULK"": how about the position for K? In ""SKULK"", K is at position2 and position5. Position2 for K: is that allowed? Yes, since the restriction for K is only not position4? And position5 is also acceptable? Yes.

But in the secret word, if it is ""SKULK"", then guess3: ""sulky"" would have shown:
   S(✓) U(-) L(-) K(-) Y(x) — which matches? 
   Actually, U was guessed at position2? In the secret word, U is at position3? So U is present? But position2 is not U? That's why U is ""in word"" but wrong position? Similarly L? In secret word, L is at position4? In guess, L was at position3? So yes. K at position4? In guess, K at position4? In secret word, K at positions2 and5? But at position4 in guess: secret has L at position4? So K was not at position4? So that's why K is ""in word"" but not correct at position4.

Then ""sulky"" got K marked '-' meaning K is in the word but not position4? That doesn't say whether K is at position2? But if there is K at position2 and position5, then K is in the word? So yes, it should be '-'. 

Therefore, SKULK is possible? Also, SKULL? 

In SKULL: positions: 
  1=S, 2=K, 3=U, 4=L, 5=L? 

Then guess3: ""sulky"": 
   position1: S (✓)
   position2: U vs K? In secret, position2 is K? so U not there? So U in word? at position3? so '-' for U? 
   position3: L vs U? In secret, position3 is U? Now we have L at position3? But secret has U? so L not at position3? 
   position4: K vs L? In secret, position4 is L? The secret has L at4? So K not at4? 
   position5: Y vs L? Secret has L? So Y not? So feedback would be S(✓) U(-) L(-) K(-) Y(x) — same as given? Yes.

Thus, both ""SKULK"" and ""SKULL"" are possible.

But also, we need to consider words with a fifth letter? For example:
   S H U L K? not valid word.
   S L U K ?: ""SLUKS""? not word.

With a fifth letter, for instance:

Place the fifth letter in position2: so ""S x y z w"", where x is fifth letter, then U,L,K in 3,4,5? But position3 must not be L? So position3: U or K? Position4: U or L? Avoid K? Position5: any.

Example: S F U L K? Not valid.

S P U L K? ""SPULK"" not common.

S D U L K? ""SDULK"" not.

Then, perhaps position5 is the fifth letter? And U,L,K in positions? 

For example: 
   Position2: L or K? Let's say position2: L? Then position3: U or K? Then position4: U or L? Avoid K? Position5: fifth letter.

So e.g.: 
   S L U K x? Where x is fifth letter? But K at position4? Cannot put K at position4? 
   Alternatively: S L K U x? Then positions: 
      position1: S
      position2: L -> allowed? Yes? Because L can be in position2? 
      position3: K -> allowed? Yes? 
      position4: U -> allowed? Yes? 
      position5: x = fifth letter.

Now, word: S L K U x? For example, ""SLK U?"" -> not easy? ""SLUKS""? Not valid? 

""SLUCK"": S-L-U-C-K? C eliminated? Not valid? 

We need to find valid words.

Maybe ""SLUBS"": S-L-U-B-S -> but B is allowed? And S duplicated? But is it valid? ""SLUBS""? Yes, deposits? But S duplicated? Also, ""SLUBS"": S at1 and5? And letters S,L,U,B? But B is new? So U,L,K? Where is K? K is not in? So ""SLUBS"" doesn't have K? But we must include K? 

That's the problem: we must include U, L, K? So words without K are invalid? 

Similarly, we must include them.

Another candidate: ""SKULP""? Not common word.

Perhaps we avoid duplicates and consider SKULK or SKULL.

But SKULL has L duplicated? SKULK has K duplicated? 

What about ""SUCK"": only 4 letters? Not 5.

""SKIP"": 4 letters? 

So maybe the word is ""SKULK"" or ""SKULL"".

But guess3 had L in position3 and feedback: L(-). In SKULL, at position3 is U? So L is at position4 and5? So the L at position3 in guess was incorrect? So '-' in feedback? Correct? 

Similarly for U: in guess3 at position2? But not there? So '-' is correct? 

And for K: at position4? But in SKULL, position4 is L? So K not at4? So '-' for K? Correct? 

And Y? Not? So both match the feedback.

So both words are possible? 

But we have to guess next? So let me think: 
   We also have to cover the possibility of a fifth letter? 

How about ""BULKS""? But it starts with B? Not S? We know position1=S? So ""BULKS"" is invalid as first letter not S.

Other words: 
   ""SAULK""? But A eliminated? 
   ""SHULK""? Not common.
   ""SPULK""? Not common.

There might be others? ""S K U L K"" and ""S K U L L"" only? 

But we have also ""SULK?"" -> incomplete?

Or ""S K U L ?"" : ""SKULP"" not valid? 

So possibly ""SKULK"" and ""SKULL"" are the only common words? 

Between these, how to choose? 

We could pick one? For instance, ""SKULK"" is less common? Or ""SKULL"" is more common? 

But also, we have not tested any new letter? So there is no clue? 

Alternatively, there might be other words with an additional letter? Let me look again.

Example: with H? 
   S H U L K -> not a word? 
   Or ""S K U L H""? Not meaningful?

Perhaps ""SLUMP"": but M eliminated? 

Or ""SLUBS"": doesn't have K? 

Idea: have U, L, K and one more letter? For example, ""S P U L K"": But we avoid it because not a word? Or ""SPULK"" is not accepted.

Maybe ""S K U M P"": but M eliminated? 

Another thought: perhaps the K at position4 is not a problem if we put it elsewhere? For example: 
   Position2: U cannot, so place L or K? 
   Position2: L? Then position3: cannot be L? So U or K? 
      Position3: U? Then position4: cannot be K? So must put L? But position4: L -> allowed? Then position5: we need to place K and the fifth letter? 

But wait, we have to place K? Position5: K -> then we get S L U L K? Double L? ""SLULK"" not a word? 

Position3: K? Then position4: cannot be K? So put U or L? 
   Position4: U? Then position5: L? ""S L K U L""? Again double L? ""SLKUL""? Not word? 
   Or position4: L? Then position5: U? ""S L K L U""? ""SLKLU""? Not word? 

Alternatively, position2: K? Then position3: U (allowed) and position4: cannot put K? So put L? Then position5: fifth letter? So ""S K U L ?"" 

Possible words: 
   ""SKUL ?"": 
        ""SKULE""? E eliminated? 
        ""SKUL J""? Not word?
        ""SKULP""? Not common? 
        ""SKUL F""? No? 

So perhaps ""SKULK"" and ""SKULL"" are the only options? 

Therefore, we should guess one of them? Since we have not guessed any word with L duplicated? Or K duplicated? But in the feedback, we don't have proof against duplicates? 

So let's choose ""SKULL"" because it's a common word? Or ""SKULK"" is less common? 

We have 6 guesses, so guess4? We can try ""SKULL"" or ""SKULK""? But let's think which one to test? 

Also, note: in SKULL, we have L at position4 and position5? And K at position2 and U at position3? 

But in the secret word, if it is ""SKULL"", then in our guess, we will get:
   S(✓) K(?) U(?) L(?) L(?) and the feedback will give positions? 

If it's different, we adjust? 

Alternatively, if we guess ""SKULL"", and it's wrong, we waste one? 

But we could guess a word that distinguishes? Not possible? 

Maybe there are other words? 

Another word: ""SULCI""? But I eliminated? 

Perhaps ""SULPH"": S-U-L-P-H? Here U at position2? But cannot put U at position2? -> feedback from guess3: U was at position2 and incorrect? So we shouldn't put U at position2? 

Moreover, H is allowed? But if we put U-L-P-H? But U must not be at position2? So ""SULPH"" has U at2? Not allowed? 

We must construct a word that avoids position2 for U? So U can only be at positions? 3,4,5.

Start with S, then position2: not U, and must be one of L,K or new letter.

For example, position2: H? Then position3: U? Like ""SHULK""? Not valid? 

Position2: D? ""SDU...""? Not easy? 

Let me consider ""SHULK"" — is it in the dictionary? I'm not sure? Some may accept? 

But officially, ""SHIRK"" would have I? 

I think it's better to go with ""SKULL"" as a common word? 

Therefore, we guess ""SKULL"".

But wait, the word must have K? And L? And U? 

For ""SKULL"": S(1), K(2), U(3), L(4), L(5)? 

Feedback for this guess: 
   Position1: ✓ = S
   Position2: K -> now, K is in the word? Not in position4? But if, for example, the secret is ""SKULK"", then K would be in position2? Correct? So ✓? 
   But we don't know? 

This guess will give feedback? 

Since we have no better idea, we guess ""SKULL""

<guess>skull</guess>

But let me confirm: 

Possible? 
   If the secret word is ""SKULL"", we get full match.
   If it is ""SKULK"", we get S(✓) K(✓) U(✓) L(-) L(?) but wait, ""SKULL"" has two L's? At4 and5? Secret ""SKULK"" has only one L? At position4, and K at5? 

Feedback: 
   For SKULL vs SKULK (secret):
     Position1: S✓
     Position2: K✓
     Position3: U✓
     Position4: L vs L? So ✓? 
     Position5: L vs K? So L is not K? Then: 
        L is in the word? But in SKULK, the letters are S,K,U,L,K -> so L is present? But we are at position5: secret has K? So we put L? So feedback for position5: L vs K? -> L is not there? But L is in the word? At position4? So since there is an L, and we put L at position5? So it should be '-' because L is in the word but not at position5? 

Actually, comparison SKULL? (guess) and SKULK (secret):
   S: g: correct
   K: g: K? Correct? 
   U: correct? 
   L: at position4? Guess and secret have L? At same position? Correct? 
   Position5: guess has L? Secret has K? So:
        The secret has L at position4? And guess put L at5? So the secret has L, but only at position4? So position5: L is not there? And L is in the word? But already matched? The secret has one L? So you might need to mark accordingly? 

But for position5: L is not in the secret at that position, and there is only one L in the secret (at position4)? And we haven't used it in feedback for position4? Actually, we'll mark:
   Position4: ✓ because same letter? 
   Position5: L in guess? Secret has K? So L is not at position5? And furthermore, how many L in secret? In SKULK, there is only one L? So at position5: since the secret's L has been counted at position4? Then this L at5 is extra? So should be x? Unless there is another L? 

Because the word SKULK has one L -> so at position5: L is not in the word? So x? 

So if secret is SKULK, guess: SKULL -> feedback: S(✓) K(✓) U(✓) L(✓) L(x) 

But wait, the L at position4 matches? So ✓? Then at position5: guess has L? Secret has K? And there isn't a second L? So x? 

Therefore, we would see four ✓ and one x? 

Similarly, if secret is SKULL, then we get all ✓. 

So with one guess, we differentiate? 

But for now, we guess to find out? 

But we are due to make a new guess? 

So I'll go with ""SKULL""? 

But note: if the secret is SKULK, then we are not done? And we will have to guess again? But we have guesses left.

Alternatively, if we guess ""SKULK"", and secret is SKULL? We get: 
   Guess: S,K,U,L,K
   Secret: S,K,U,L,L
   Feedback: 
      S✓ 
      K✓ 
      U✓ 
      L✓ 
      K vs L: L is at position4 in secret? But position5: guess has K, secret has L? 
         So K at position5: secret has L? And no more K? Because position2 K? So we used one K at position2? Then position5: this K is not? Because secret has L? So K is not at position5? And no second K? So x? 
      Thus: same as above? ✓,✓,✓,✓,x? 

So both guesses would get almost the same feedback? 

Therefore, it doesn't matter? But if we get back, we have information? 

But note: we have a fifth letter possibility? 

But for now, I think ""SKULL"" is more common?

So we guess ""SKULL"".

Let me box it.The previous feedback provides critical clues:

1. **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗).
2. **Guess 2: ""moist""** → Only ""S"" is present but not in position 4 (-); M, O, I, T are absent (✗).
3. **Guess 3: ""sulky""** → 
   - ""S"" is correct and in position 1 (✓).
   - ""U"" is present but not in position 2 (-).
   - ""L"" is present but not in position 3 (-).
   - ""K"" is present but not in position 4 (-).
   - ""Y"" is absent (✗).

### Key Deductions:
- The word starts with **S** (from ""sulky"" ✓ feedback).
- **U, L, and K** are in the word but not in positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively (from ""-"" feedback).
- Letters **C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, Y** are eliminated (from ""✗"" feedback).
- Remaining possible letters: **B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z**.
- Only one position is unknown (positions 2–5 must contain U, L, K, and one new letter or a duplicate of existing letters).

### Constraints for Positions:
- Position 1: **S** (fixed).
- Position 2: Cannot be U (from feedback), so it must be L, K, or a new letter.
- Position 3: Cannot be L (from feedback), so it must be U, K, or a new letter.
- Position 4: Cannot be K (from feedback), so it must be U, L, or a new letter.
- Position 5: No restrictions.

### Strategy for This Guess:
- Prioritize words starting with ""S"" that include **U, L, K**.
- The word must conform to position constraints (e.g., U not in pos 2, L not in pos 3, K not in pos 4).
- Explore valid 5-letter words meeting these criteria from the remaining alphabet.
- Candidate words considered: ""SKULK"" (S-K-U-L-K) and ""SKULL"" (S-K-U-L-L). Both use allowed letters and fit position rules.
- Between these, **""SKULL""** is selected as it is a common word, and ""K"" is already known to not be in position 4.

### Next Steps:
- This guess tests whether the duplicates ""L/L"" or another configuration matches the secret word.
- Feedback will clarify positions of U, L, K and potential duplicates or new letters.",Guess 4: skull -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) K(✓) U(✓) L(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
