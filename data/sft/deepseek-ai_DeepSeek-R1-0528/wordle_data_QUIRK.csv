First, I need to make an initial guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means selecting a word with common letters that might appear in many words, and ideally, using letters that are frequently used in English.

Common starting words in games like Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", or ""ADIEU"" because they use a mix of vowels and common consonants. Vowels are important since most words have vowels, and consonants like S, T, R, N, L are common.

Let me list out some high-frequency letters in English 5-letter words:

- Vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y)

- Consonants: S, T, R, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

A good starter word should have diverse letters to cover more possibilities. For example, ""ADIEU"" uses A, D, I, E, U – that's four vowels and one consonant, which might be good for checking vowels but not so much for consonants. Since vowels are limited (only 5-6), it might be better to have a balance.

""CRANE"" is popular: C, R, A, N, E – has two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N). Good mix.

""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (S, L, T).

""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T – two vowels (O, A) and three consonants (R, S, T).

Since I'm the one guessing, and this is the first turn, any of these should be fine. But let me choose one.

I think ""CRANE"" is a solid choice because C, R, A, N, E are all fairly common letters. E is the most common letter in English, A is also very common, and R, S, T are high-frequency consonants. In ""CRANE"", I have E which is common, A is common, R is common, N is common, C is less common but still useful.

Another option is ""RAISE"" – R, A, I, S, E – which has three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S). But S and R are common.

To avoid duplication, I should pick a word without repeated letters, which all these examples have.

For the first guess, I'll go with ""CRANE"". It's a standard opener.

So, my guessed word is ""CRANE"".

Alright, let me process the feedback from the first guess to inform my next move. The word was ""CRANE"" and the feedback was: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x). 

First, breaking this down:
- C, A, N, E are marked as 'x' – these letters are definitely not in the secret word. That means the word has no C, A, N, or E at all.  
- R is marked as '-', meaning R is in the word but not in the second position (since in ""CRANE"", R is in position 2). So R is present, and its correct position is somewhere else—positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Since A, E are vowels, and they’re excluded, the secret word likely uses other vowels like I, O, U, or sometimes Y. Also, with E eliminated—a very common letter—this narrows down possibilities significantly.  

Now, I need a new guess that:
1. Avoids C, A, N, E entirely (since they’re 'x').  
2. Includes R (because it’s confirmed present).  
3. Places R not in position 2, so it should be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
4. Uses other common letters to probe for more information.  

Considering vowel possibilities: with A and E out, common vowels left are I, O, U. Y could also act as a vowel. Consonants like S, T, L, M, P, D are good candidates since they're frequent.  

Possible words:  
- Since R is confirmed, start with words containing R and other high-frequency letters.  
- Avoid reused positions: in my next guess, R shouldn’t be in position 2.  

Good candidate words:  
- ""ROUST"": R in position 1, O,U,S,T. But O and U are vowels. R could be in position 1 here.  
- ""SPRIG"": Has R in position 3. Includes S,P,I,G—probes I and G.  
- First, I need to cover vowel gaps. Since A/E are out, focus on I or O/U.  

Strong options:  
""PIOUS"": Includes I,O,U—but no R, and R is necessary. Must include R.  
So reject ""PIOUS"".  

""ROBIN"": R in position 1 (position 2 is O—not R), B,I,N. But N was 'x' from last guess, so N can't be used. N is excluded.  
Similarly, avoid A,N,E,C.  

""ROTIS"" – not a word.  
Actual words only.  

""WORDY"": Has R in position 4 (W,O,R,D,Y). Uses O,Y as vowels. Tests multiple others.  

Better idea: Prioritize words with R and vowels like I/O.  

""SHIRT"": S,H,I,R,T – R in position 4. Positions: S(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), T(5). This has I as a vowel and probes S,H,T.  

Or ""SPORT"": S,P,O,R,T – R in position 4.  

But maybe words with R in different positions to test placement.  

Another common starting word after elimination: ""SLIMY"" – but no R. Must include R.  

So constrained: must have R, no C,A,N,E.  

List of helpful letters: S,T,L,I,O,M,P,D,B,G,F,V,K,H – and R confirmed.  

Optimal: include R and untested vowels/consonants.  

""GRIMP"" – not common.  

""PRISM"": P,R,I,S,M – R in position 2? Wait, position 2 is R in ""PRISM"". But feedback said R is not in position 2, so in my guess, I should avoid placing R in position 2 to honor what we know. Even though it's a guess, I can choose not to put R there.  

In feedback, R is in word but not pos2, so for my next guess, I can place R elsewhere to test potential positions.  

""PRISM"" has R in pos2—if I use it, and if secret R is truly not there, I'll get - or x for R? No: rules say the symbol means for the letter: if in word but wrong position, it's '-', regardless of where I place it if incorrect. But since I know it’s not in pos2, I should avoid putting it there to avoid wasting a position.  

By placing R elsewhere, say pos1, I can get clearer feedback: if secret R is in pos1, I'd get ✓, or if not pos1, '-'.  

So better to place R in a new position. In ""CRANE"", pos2 was wrong, so place R in 1,3,4,5.  

Possible words:  
- Pos1: ""ROSTS"" invalid; ""ROAST"" but has A which is excluded—A is 'x', so no.  

""ROUGE""—has E? E is excluded.  

""ROUGH"": R,O,U,G,H – no E/N/A/C. R in 1. Probes O,U,G,H.  

""PLUMB""—no R. Must include R.  

""DOUGH""—has O,U,G,H but no R.  

""CRUFT""—has C? C eliminated.  

So avoid banned letters.  

Brainstorm: R + vowels I/O/U/Y + consonants not C,A,N,E.  

""BRISK"": B,R,I,S,K – R in position 2? Position 2 would be R again, which we know is wrong place. In ""BRISK"", R is pos2, same as before—I should avoid that to not reuse the incorrect position.  

Place R elsewhere.  

""RISKY"": Positions: R(1), I(2), S(3), K(4), Y(5) – R in pos1. Avoids pos2. Tests I,Y,S,K.  

Or ""BIROS"": B,I,R,O,S – R in pos3.  

But ""BIROS"" might be rare.  

Popular choice: ""SPIRT"" – variant? ""SPIRY""? Not ideal.  

Better: ""SHORT"": S,H,O,R,T – R in position 4. Places R not in pos2, probes S,H,O,T.  

""SHORT"" has O as vowel.  

""ROTED"" – not word.  

""SIRLO"": invalid.  

""WORDS"": W,O,R,D,S – R in pos3. Letters: W,O,D,S—all untested.  

But S is very common, so probing S is good.  

""TRIPS"": T,R,I,P,S – R in position 2? Positions: T(1), R(2), etc. Oh, R is in pos2 again. Avoid—since feedback says R not pos2, I shouldn't reuse that spot.  

In ""TRIPS"", R is in pos2, which I know is incorrect, so it would be inefficient.  

Choose words where R is in 1,3,4,5.  

E.g., position 1: ""RUSTS"" not 5-letter word; ""RUSTY"" – R,U,S,T,Y – R in 1, tests U,Y,T,S. S and T are common.  

""RUSTY"" makes sense as a word.  

Position 5 e.g., ""AZURE"" but A excluded—invalid.  

""STARE"" has E and A—excluded.  

So ""RUSTY"" seems decent: letters R,U,S,T,Y—all valid, no banned letters. R pos1 is new.  

Another option: ""POLAR"" has A—excluded.  

""GUILD"" no R.  

""BIRDS"": B,I,R,D,S – R in pos3. Avoids pos2. Tests B,I,D,S.  

But D and B less common—prioritize high-frequency like S,T,L.  

""FJORD"" – J not common, O used.  

Best: since S,T,U,L are untested, include them.  

""ROILS"": R,O,I,L,S – R in pos1, positions avoid 2.  

""ROILS"" is a word? Roils means disturbs, valid. Letters: R,O,I,L,S—tests O,I,L,S.  

""SPOIL"": S,P,O,I,L – no R. But need R.  

Must include R.  

So ""ROILS"" or ""RUSTY"".  

""RUSTY"": R,U,S,T,Y – consonants S,T, vowels U,Y.  

""ROILS"": R,O,I,L,S – vowels O,I, consonants L,S.  

Both seem fine.  

Since original had no vowels (A,E gone), likely U or O/I present. Y can be vowel.  

""RUSTY"" gives more consonant coverage: S and T are very high frequency.  

In ""RUSTY"": U is vowel, Y can be vowel/consonant, but positionally at end, often vowel sound.  

Similarly, ""TRUMP"" has U but M,P—but ""TRUMP"" places R in pos2 if T first.  

Let's avoid pos2 for R.  

""TURFS"" – has F,S; R in pos3.  

But less common word.  

Stick with ""RUSTY"" or ""LOURS"" invalid.  

""WORDY"": W,O,R,D,Y – R in pos3. Tests W,O,D,Y—W lower frequency.  

Better to cover common letters.  

I think ""RUSHY"" not word.  

Standard next guess could be with S and T.  

Since R is confirmed and not pos2, aim to cover where R might be.  

Also, secret word has R but not in pos2, and no C,A,N,E—so possible letters.  

For maximum info, use a word with R in another position and include new vowels.  

Ultimately, I'll go with ""RUSTY"" – it has R in position 1 (new), S,T which are very common and untested, U as vowel, Y as semi-vowel. This covers different angles and could yield good feedback.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, E are **not** in the secret word (all marked 'x'). This means the word contains none of these letters.
- R **is** in the word but not in the second position (marked '-'). So R must appear in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

For the next guess:
- Must avoid C, A, N, E entirely.
- Must include R.
- Should place R in a position other than 2 (position 1, 3, 4, or 5) to test alternative placements and gather more info.
- Prioritize high-frequency unused letters (like S, T, I, O, U, L, M) and vowels other than A/E (e.g., I, O, U, Y).

A strong candidate is ""rusty"":
- **R** in position 1 (tests a new position for R).
- Includes **U** and **Y** as potential vowels (since A/E are out).
- Includes **S** and **T**, which are high-frequency consonants.
- Avoids banned letters (C, A, N, E) and uses common unused characters.

This guess efficiently probes the presence of S, T, U, and Y while leveraging the confirmed R. The feedback will clarify R's true position and reveal if S, T, U, or Y are present.

By placing R elsewhere, say pos1, I can get clearer feedback: if secret R is in pos1, I'd get ✓, or if not pos1, '-'.  

So better to place R in a new position. In ""CRANE"", pos2 was wrong, so place R in 1,3,4,5.  

Possible words:  
- Pos1: ""ROSTS"" invalid; ""ROAST"" but has A which is excluded—A is 'x', so no.  

""ROUGE""—has E? E is excluded.  

""ROUGH"": R,O,U,G,H – no E/N/A/C. R in 1. Probes O,U,G,H.  

""PLUMB""—no R. Must include R.  

""DOUGH""—has O,U,G,H but no R.  

""CRUFT""—has C? C eliminated.  

So avoid banned letters.  

Brainstorm: R + vowels I/O/U/Y + consonants not C,A,N,E.  

""BRISK"": B,R,I,S,K – R in position 2? Position 2 would be R again, which we know is wrong place. In ""BRISK"", R is pos2, same as before—I should avoid that to not reuse the incorrect position.  

Place R elsewhere.  

""RISKY"": Positions: R(1), I(2), S(3), K(4), Y(5) – R in pos1. Avoids pos2. Tests I,Y,S,K.  

Or ""BIROS"": B,I,R,O,S – R in pos3.  

But ""BIROS"" might be rare.  

Popular choice: ""SPIRT"" – variant? ""SPIRY""? Not ideal.  

Better: ""SHORT"": S,H,O,R,T – R in position 4. Places R not in pos2, probes S,H,O,T.  

""SHORT"" has O as vowel.  

""ROTED"" – not word.  

""SIRLO"": invalid.  

""WORDS"": W,O,R,D,S – R in pos3. Letters: W,O,D,S—all untested.  

But S is very common, so probing S is good.  

""TRIPS"": T,R,I,P,S – R in position 2? Positions: T(1), R(2), etc. Oh, R is in pos2 again. Avoid—since feedback says R not pos2, I shouldn't reuse that spot.  

In ""TRIPS"", R is in pos2, which I know is incorrect, so it would be inefficient.  

Choose words where R is in 1,3,4,5.  

E.g., position 1: ""RUSTS"" not 5-letter word; ""RUSTY"" – R,U,S,T,Y – R in 1, tests U,Y,T,S. S and T are common.  

""RUSTY"" makes sense as a word.  

Position 5 e.g., ""AZURE"" but A excluded—invalid.  

""STARE"" has E and A—excluded.  

So ""RUSTY"" seems decent: letters R,U,S,T,Y—all valid, no banned letters. R pos1 is new.  

Another option: ""POLAR"" has A—excluded.  

""GUILD"" no R.  

""BIRDS"": B,I,R,D,S – R in pos3. Avoids pos2. Tests B,I,D,S.  

But D and B less common—prioritize high-frequency like S,T,L.  

""FJORD"" – J not common, O used.  

Best: since S,T,U,L are untested, include them.  

""ROILS"": R,O,I,L,S – R in pos1, positions avoid 2.  

""ROILS"" is a word? Roils means disturbs, valid. Letters: R,O,I,L,S—tests O,I,L,S.  

""SPOIL"": S,P,O,I,L – no R. But need R.  

Must include R.  

So ""ROILS"" or ""RUSTY"".  

""RUSTY"": R,U,S,T,Y – consonants S,T, vowels U,Y.  

""ROILS"": R,O,I,L,S – vowels O,I, consonants L,S.  

Both seem fine.  

Since original had no vowels (A,E gone), likely U or O/I present. Y can be vowel.  

""RUSTY"" gives more consonant coverage: S and T are very high frequency.  

In ""RUSTY"": U is vowel, Y can be vowel/consonant, but positionally at end, often vowel sound.  

Similarly, ""TRUMP"" has U but M,P—but ""TRUMP"" places R in pos2 if T first.  

Let's avoid pos2 for R.  

""TURFS"" – has F,S; R in pos3.  

But less common word.  

Stick with ""RUSTY"" or ""LOURS"" invalid.  

""WORDY"": W,O,R,D,Y – R in pos3. Tests W,O,D,Y—W lower frequency.  

Better to cover common letters.  

I think ""RUSHY"" not word.  

Standard next guess could be with S and T.  

Since R is confirmed and not pos2, aim to cover where R might be.  

Also, secret word has R but not in pos2, and no C,A,N,E—so possible letters.  

For maximum info, use a word with R in another position and include new vowels.  

Ultimately, I'll go with ""RUSTY"" – it has R in position 1 (new), S,T which are very common and untested, U as vowel, Y as semi-vowel. This covers different angles and could yield good feedback.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, E are **not** in the secret word (all marked 'x'). This means the word contains none of these letters.
- R **is** in the word but not in the second position (marked '-'). So R must appear in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

For the next guess:
- Must avoid C, A, N, E entirely.
- Must include R.
- Should place R in a position other than 2 (position 1, 3, 4, or 5) to test alternative placements and gather more info.
- Prioritize high-frequency unused letters (like S, T, I, O, U, L, M) and vowels other than A/E (e.g., I, O, U, Y).

A strong candidate is ""rusty"":
- **R** in position 1 (tests a new position for R).
- Includes **U** and **Y** as potential vowels (since A/E are out).
- Includes **S** and **T**, which are high-frequency consonants.
- Avoids banned letters (C, A, N, E) and uses common unused characters.

This guess efficiently probes the presence of S, T, U, and Y while leveraging the confirmed R. The feedback will clarify R's true position and reveal if S, T, U, or Y are present.",Guess 2: rusty -> FEEDBACK: R(-) U(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to make an initial guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means selecting a word with common letters that might appear in many words, and ideally, using letters that are frequently used in English.

Common starting words in games like Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", or ""ADIEU"" because they use a mix of vowels and common consonants. Vowels are important since most words have vowels, and consonants like S, T, R, N, L are common.

Let me list out some high-frequency letters in English 5-letter words:

- Vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y)

- Consonants: S, T, R, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

A good starter word should have diverse letters to cover more possibilities. For example, ""ADIEU"" uses A, D, I, E, U – that's four vowels and one consonant, which might be good for checking vowels but not so much for consonants. Since vowels are limited (only 5-6), it might be better to have a balance.

""CRANE"" is popular: C, R, A, N, E – has two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N). Good mix.

""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (S, L, T).

""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T – two vowels (O, A) and three consonants (R, S, T).

Since I'm the one guessing, and this is the first turn, any of these should be fine. But let me choose one.

I think ""CRANE"" is a solid choice because C, R, A, N, E are all fairly common letters. E is the most common letter in English, A is also very common, and R, S, T are high-frequency consonants. In ""CRANE"", I have E which is common, A is common, R is common, N is common, C is less common but still useful.

Another option is ""RAISE"" – R, A, I, S, E – which has three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S). But S and R are common.

To avoid duplication, I should pick a word without repeated letters, which all these examples have.

For the first guess, I'll go with ""CRANE"". It's a standard opener.

So, my guessed word is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let me process the feedback from the first guess to inform my next move. The word was ""CRANE"" and the feedback was: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x). 

First, breaking this down:
- C, A, N, E are marked as 'x' – these letters are definitely not in the secret word. That means the word has no C, A, N, or E at all.  
- R is marked as '-', meaning R is in the word but not in the second position (since in ""CRANE"", R is in position 2). So R is present, and its correct position is somewhere else—positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Since A, E are vowels, and they’re excluded, the secret word likely uses other vowels like I, O, U, or sometimes Y. Also, with E eliminated—a very common letter—this narrows down possibilities significantly.  

Now, I need a new guess that:
1. Avoids C, A, N, E entirely (since they’re 'x').  
2. Includes R (because it’s confirmed present).  
3. Places R not in position 2, so it should be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
4. Uses other common letters to probe for more information.  

Considering vowel possibilities: with A and E out, common vowels left are I, O, U. Y could also act as a vowel. Consonants like S, T, L, M, P, D are good candidates since they're frequent.  

Possible words:  
- Since R is confirmed, start with words containing R and other high-frequency letters.  
- Avoid reused positions: in my next guess, R shouldn’t be in position 2.  

Good candidate words:  
- ""ROUST"": R in position 1, O,U,S,T. But O and U are vowels. R could be in position 1 here.  
- ""SPRIG"": Has R in position 3. Includes S,P,I,G—probes I and G.  
- First, I need to cover vowel gaps. Since A/E are out, focus on I or O/U.  

Strong options:  
""PIOUS"": Includes I,O,U—but no R, and R is necessary. Must include R.  
So reject ""PIOUS"".  

""ROBIN"": R in position 1 (position 2 is O—not R), B,I,N. But N was 'x' from last guess, so N can't be used. N is excluded.  
Similarly, avoid A,N,E,C.  

""ROTIS"" – not a word.  
Actual words only.  

""WORDY"": Has R in position 4 (W,O,R,D,Y). Uses O,Y as vowels. Tests multiple others.  

Better idea: Prioritize words with R and vowels like I/O.  

""SHIRT"": S,H,I,R,T – R in position 4. Positions: S(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), T(5). This has I as a vowel and probes S,H,T.  

Or ""SPORT"": S,P,O,R,T – R in position 4.  

But maybe words with R in different positions to test placement.  

Another common starting word after elimination: ""SLIMY"" – but no R. Must include R.  

So constrained: must have R, no C,A,N,E.  

List of helpful letters: S,T,L,I,O,M,P,D,B,G,F,V,K,H – and R confirmed.  

Optimal: include R and untested vowels/consonants.  

""GRIMP"" – not common.  

""PRISM"": P,R,I,S,M – R in position 2? Wait, position 2 is R in ""PRISM"". But feedback said R is not in position 2, so in my guess, I should avoid placing R in position 2 to honor what we know. Even though it's a guess, I can choose not to put R there.  

In feedback, R is in word but not pos2, so for my next guess, I can place R elsewhere to test potential positions.  

""PRISM"" has R in pos2—if I use it, and if secret R is truly not there, I'll get - or x for R? No: rules say the symbol means for the letter: if in word but wrong position, it's '-', regardless of where I place it if incorrect. But since I know it’s not in pos2, I should avoid putting it there to avoid wasting a position.  

By placing R elsewhere, say pos1, I can get clearer feedback: if secret R is in pos1, I'd get ✓, or if not pos1, '-'.  

So better to place R in a new position. In ""CRANE"", pos2 was wrong, so place R in 1,3,4,5.  

Possible words:  
- Pos1: ""ROSTS"" invalid; ""ROAST"" but has A which is excluded—A is 'x', so no.  

""ROUGE""—has E? E is excluded.  

""ROUGH"": R,O,U,G,H – no E/N/A/C. R in 1. Probes O,U,G,H.  

""PLUMB""—no R. Must include R.  

""DOUGH""—has O,U,G,H but no R.  

""CRUFT""—has C? C eliminated.  

So avoid banned letters.  

Brainstorm: R + vowels I/O/U/Y + consonants not C,A,N,E.  

""BRISK"": B,R,I,S,K – R in position 2? Position 2 would be R again, which we know is wrong place. In ""BRISK"", R is pos2, same as before—I should avoid that to not reuse the incorrect position.  

Place R elsewhere.  

""RISKY"": Positions: R(1), I(2), S(3), K(4), Y(5) – R in pos1. Avoids pos2. Tests I,Y,S,K.  

Or ""BIROS"": B,I,R,O,S – R in pos3.  

But ""BIROS"" might be rare.  

Popular choice: ""SPIRT"" – variant? ""SPIRY""? Not ideal.  

Better: ""SHORT"": S,H,O,R,T – R in position 4. Places R not in pos2, probes S,H,O,T.  

""SHORT"" has O as vowel.  

""ROTED"" – not word.  

""SIRLO"": invalid.  

""WORDS"": W,O,R,D,S – R in pos3. Letters: W,O,D,S—all untested.  

But S is very common, so probing S is good.  

""TRIPS"": T,R,I,P,S – R in position 2? Positions: T(1), R(2), etc. Oh, R is in pos2 again. Avoid—since feedback says R not pos2, I shouldn't reuse that spot.  

In ""TRIPS"", R is in pos2, which I know is incorrect, so it would be inefficient.

Even though it\'s a guess, I can choose not to put R there.  \n\nIn feedback, R is in word but not pos2, so for my next guess, I can place R elsewhere to test potential positions.  \n\n""PRISM"" has R in pos2—if I use it, and if secret R is truly not there, I\'ll get - or x for R? No: rules say the symbol means for the letter: if in word but wrong position, it\'s \'-\', regardless of where I place it if incorrect. But since I know it’s not in pos2, I should avoid putting it there to avoid wasting a position.  \n\nBy placing R elsewhere, say pos1, I can get clearer feedback: if secret R is in pos1, I\'d get ✓, or if not pos1, \'-\'.  \n\nSo better to place R in a new position. In ""CRANE"", pos2 was wrong, so place R in 1,3,4,5.  \n\nPossible words:  \n- Pos1: ""ROSTS"" invalid; ""ROAST"" but has A which is excluded—A is \'x\', so no.  \n\n""ROUGE""—has E? E is excluded.  \n\n""ROUGH"": R,O,U,G,H – no E/N/A/C. R in 1. Probes O,U,G,H.  \n\n""PLUMB""—no R. Must include R.  \n\n""DOUGH""—has O,U,G,H but no R.  \n\n""CRUFT""—has C? C eliminated.  \n\nSo avoid banned letters.  \n\nBrainstorm: R + vowels I/O/U/Y + consonants not C,A,N,E.  \n\n""BRISK"": B,R,I,S,K – R in position 2? Position 2 would be R again, which we know is wrong place. In ""BRISK"", R is pos2, same as before—I should avoid that to not reuse the incorrect position.  \n\nPlace R elsewhere.  \n\n""RISKY"": Positions: R(1), I(2), S(3), K(4), Y(5) – R in pos1. Avoids pos2. Tests I,Y,S,K.  \n\nOr ""BIROS"": B,I,R,O,S – R in pos3.  \n\nBut ""BIROS"" might be rare.  \n\nPopular choice: ""SPIRT"" – variant? ""SPIRY""? Not ideal.  \n\nBetter: ""SHORT"": S,H,O,R,T – R in position 4. Places R not in pos2, probes S,H,O,T.  \n\n""SHORT"" has O as vowel.  \n\n""ROTED"" – not word.  \n\n""SIRLO"": invalid.  \n\n""WORDS"": W,O,R,D,S – R in pos3. Letters: W,O,D,S—all untested.  \n\nBut S is very common, so probing S is good.  \n\n""TRIPS"": T,R,I,P,S – R in position 2? Positions: T(1), R(2), etc. Oh, R is in pos2 again. Avoid—since feedback says R not pos2, I shouldn\'t reuse that spot.  \n\nIn ""TRIPS"", R is in pos2, which I know is incorrect, so it would be inefficient.  \n\nChoose words where R is in 1,3,4,5.  \n\nE.g., position 1: ""RUSTS"" not 5-letter word; ""RUSTY"" – R,U,S,T,Y – R in 1, tests U,Y,T,S. S and T are common.  \n\n""RUSTY"" makes sense as a word.  \n\nPosition 5 e.g., ""AZURE"" but A excluded—invalid.  \n\n""STARE"" has E and A—excluded.  \n\nSo ""RUSTY"" seems decent: letters R,U,S,T,Y—all valid, no banned letters. R pos1 is new.  \n\nAnother option: ""POLAR"" has A—excluded.  \n\n""GUILD"" no R.  \n\n""BIRDS"": B,I,R,D,S – R in pos3. Avoids pos2. Tests B,I,D,S.  \n\nBut D and B less common—prioritize high-frequency like S,T,L.  \n\n""FJORD"" – J not common, O used.  \n\nBest: since S,T,U,L are untested, include them.  \n\n""ROILS"": R,O,I,L,S – R in pos1, positions avoid 2.  \n\n""ROILS"" is a word? Roils means disturbs, valid. Letters: R,O,I,L,S—tests O,I,L,S.  \n\n""SPOIL"": S,P,O,I,L – no R. But need R.  \n\nMust include R.  \n\nSo ""ROILS"" or ""RUSTY"".  \n\n""RUSTY"": R,U,S,T,Y – consonants S,T, vowels U,Y.  \n\n""ROILS"": R,O,I,L,S – vowels O,I, consonants L,S.  \n\nBoth seem fine.  \n\nSince original had no vowels (A,E gone), likely U or O/I present. Y can be vowel.  \n\n""RUSTY"" gives more consonant coverage: S and T are very high frequency.  \n\nIn ""RUSTY"": U is vowel, Y can be vowel/consonant, but positionally at end, often vowel sound.  \n\nSimilarly, ""TRUMP"" has U but M,P—but ""TRUMP"" places R in pos2 if T first.  \n\nLet\'s avoid pos2 for R.  \n\n""TURFS"" – has F,S; R in pos3.  \n\nBut less common word.  \n\nStick with ""RUSTY"" or ""LOURS"" invalid.  \n\n""WORDY"": W,O,R,D,Y – R in pos3. Tests W,O,D,Y—W lower frequency.  \n\nBetter to cover common letters.  \n\nI think ""RUSHY"" not word.  \n\nStandard next guess could be with S and T.  \n\nSince R is confirmed and not pos2, aim to cover where R might be.  \n\nAlso, secret word has R but not in pos2, and no C,A,N,E—so possible letters.  \n\nFor maximum info, use a word with R in another position and include new vowels.  \n\nUltimately, I\'ll go with ""RUSTY"" – it has R in position 1 (new), S,T which are very common and untested, U as vowel, Y as semi-vowel. This covers different angles and could yield good feedback.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, N, E are **not** in the secret word (all marked \'x\'). This means the word contains none of these letters.\n- R **is** in the word but not in the second position (marked \'-\'). So R must appear in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must avoid C, A, N, E entirely.\n- Must include R.\n- Should place R in a position other than 2 (position 1, 3, 4, or 5) to test alternative placements and gather more info.\n- Prioritize high-frequency unused letters (like S, T, I, O, U, L, M) and vowels other than A/E (e.g., I, O, U, Y).\n\nA strong candidate is ""rusty"":\n- **R** in position 1 (tests a new position for R).\n- Includes **U** and **Y** as potential vowels (since A/E are out).\n- Includes **S** and **T**, which are high-frequency consonants.\n- Avoids banned letters (C, A, N, E) and uses common unused characters.\n\nThis guess efficiently probes the presence of S, T, U, and Y while leveraging the confirmed R. The feedback will clarify R\'s true position and reveal if S, T, U, or Y are present.\n\n<guess>rusty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: rusty -> FEEDBACK: R(-) U(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have two guesses of feedback:
1. ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - This means: 
     - Letters not in word: C, A, N, E
     - R is in the word but not in position 2 (since in ""crane"" R is position 2)
2. ""rusty"" -> R(-) U(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)
   - Interpretation:
     - U is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 2, because in ""rusty"" U is position 2)
     - R is in the word but not in position 1 (since it shows R(-) and position 1 in this guess)
     - Letters not in word: S, T, Y

Combine the information:
- Confirmed absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, T, Y
- Present letters: R, U
- U is in position 2 (from second guess U(✓))

From first guess R(-): R is in the word but not position 2 (of ""crane"").
From second guess R(-): R is not in position 1 (of ""rusty"").
So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Additionally, U is fixed in position 2.

So the secret word structure: _ U _ _ _
And R is in one of positions 3,4,5.

Now, list all possible letters. Present: R,U. Absent: C,A,N,E,S,T,Y.
Excluded letters so far: C,A,N,E,S,T,Y

Remaining English letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,V,W,X,Z

But common letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,V,W

Possible vowels: I,O (since U is already in position 2, and A,E gone; Y also gone)

Now, we need to form a word: ? U ? ? ?
With one R in positions 3,4, or 5.

Since U is fixed at position 2, and R must be in 3,4, or 5.

For our next guess, we want to include R in a new position (3,4, or 5) and test other common letters.

We should prioritize:
- Place R not in position 1 or 2 (rule out 1 and 2), so only 3,4,5 possible. In our next guess, put R in position 3? But not necessarily the correct position, but to test.
- Also include other potential vowels or common consonants.

Possible words:
First, let's think of words matching ""_ U _ _ _"" with R somewhere.

But we also have eliminated many letters: no C,A,N,E,S,T,Y.

Examples: 
- If R in position 3: _ U R _ _
- If R in position 4: _ U _ R _
- If R in position 5: _ U _ _ R

Find valid 5-letter English words fitting these.

_ U R _ _ : possibilities:
Bully? B U L L Y - but Y is gone (absent). Invalid.
Curly? C and Y gone. Invalid.
Furry? F U R R Y - Y gone, and R repeated? but we don't know about doubles yet. However, R might be double, but feedback didn't indicate that. Also, we have R only once so far in guesses, so it could be double. But Y is gone.
Purge? P U R G E - E is absent. Invalid.
Guild? G U I L D - has no R? Wait, if pattern U R, not.

Position: _ U R _ _
Words: Could be ""CURSE"" but C and S gone. ""FURSE"" not word.
""PURGE"" has E, gone.
""LOURD""? not common.
Possible: ""BURMA"": B U R M A - but A gone.
""AURIC"" A gone.
""OURIE"" not word? no.
Better: ""JUDGE"" no R.
Perhaps R in other positions.

_ U _ R _ : examples:
Curds? C gone.
Furls? F U R L S - S absent.
Gourmet too long.
Demur? D E M U R - E gone, and 4 letters? not 5.
Lured? L U R E D - E gone.
Words ending with U:R not common.

Better search for words with U in position 2 and R later.

List of possible words: ignoring duplicate R for now.

With U at 2, R at 3: e.g., BURLY - but Y absent.
PURIM - but M possible? letters: P,U,R,I,M - I and M untested.

Similarly, U at 2, R at 4: _ U _ R _
e.g., CHURL? C and H, C gone? C absent; CH not a letter per se, but C is banned. ""CHURN"" has C? No, it starts with C — forbidden. ""MOURN"" M O U R N - N absent? N gone.
""POURS"" P O U R S - S absent.
""FOURTH"" too long.

U at 2, R at 5: _ U _ _ R
e.g., DOUBR? not word. HUMOR? H U M O R - O and M possible.
Similarly, VAPOR? V A P O R - A gone.
""SUDOR""? not common.
""JUMAR"" not common.
Valid: ""RUMOR"" but R is position 1, which we know is not R's position? But ""RUMOR"" has U position 2? Positions: R(1), U(2), M(3), O(4), R(5) - R at 1 and 5. But R must be in the word, and we know position 1 is not for R? From second guess, R at position 1 got '-', meaning R is not position 1, so secret R cannot be at position 1.

In secret word, position 1 cannot be R because in guess 2 R not position 1.

Therefore, words starting with R are invalid if R is at position 1? No-- the secret word might have R at multiple positions? Unlikely, but possible. But the feedback for guess ""rusty"" R at position 1 got '-', meaning the letter R is present but not in position 1. So in the secret word, R must exist, but not at position 1. Also, not position 2? From first guess, we know R not position 2 (because guess1 position2 R was incorrect), guess2 position1 R incorrect.

So R must be at 3,4, or5 in secret.

Now, for our next guess, we choose a word that: 
- Must include U at position 2 because we know it's correct (U(✓) from last guess). Actually, to verify? No, confirmed so U should be at position 2.

Additionally, include R in position 3,4, or 5 to test.

But since U is fixed, and R must be somewhere, perhaps try R in position 3 for example.

Also, avoid used letters: absent: C,A,N,E,S,T,Y

Possible vowel: O or I

Now, words: _ U R _ _ 
Examples: BURKA? not English.
PURDA? No.
Valid: ""HURON"" - proper? ""HURLY"" Y gone.
""GURLY"" not word.

_ U _ R _
Examples: ""QUART"" Q and A? A gone.
""BOURD""? rare.
""MOURD"" not word.

Better: _ U L R _ no.
Perhaps ""MULCH"" no R. ""MULCT""? M U L C T - C absent? C gone.
Tough.

_ U _ _ R
Examples: ""JUDGER"" too long? 6 letters.
""DUMAR"" not word.
Valid: ""HUMOR"" - H U M O R - letters: H,U,M,O,R
Position: H(1), U(2), M(3), O(4), R(5)
This works: no forbidden letters; positions: U at 2 is correct, R at position 5 which is possible.

Similarly, ""NUMBLY"" has N, gone.
""SUDOR"" not English.
""PUDOR"" perhaps.

But ""HUMOR"" is a valid word.

Another: ""RUMOR"" but R at position 1 which we cannot have? For our guess word, we can put R at position 1? But we know it's wrong. Yes, we can—it would waste a slot, but ""RUMOR"" positions: R(1),U(2),M(3),O(4),R(5) — U at 2 is fixed correct, R at 1 will be marked wrong (- or x? x because not present? no, R is present but at another position). Since R is present, placing it at position 1 would get '-', which we already know. But it occupies a spot that could be used for a new letter.

Similarly, R at 5 might be correct or not.

To maximize new letters, avoid putting R where we know it shouldn't be.

In next guess, put U at position 2 (fixed), then R in a position that might be correct, one of 3,4,5.

For ""HUMOR"": letters H,U,M,O,R
- All unused letters except U and R.
- Probes H, M, O.

Another possibility: ""LUPUS"" S absent? No S allowed.
""DUTCH"" not standard.

Possible words: 
- With O: since vowel needed, O is common.
""FUDOR"" not word.
""POUFF"" not.

Another valid word: ""COUTH"" but C gone? C absent.
""GUIDE"" E gone.

So ""HUMOR"" seems good.

Other options: ""BOUND"" O,U,N—N absent.
""MOULD"" O,U,L,D— no R? Not included R but we mustn't include R? We do not have to include R in every guess? To win, I need to guess the word, but I can guess words without R? But I know R is in the word, so to get green, I need to include it. And to get correct placement. But from rules, I can guess any word, but strategically, include known present letters to find position.

Since U is fixed at position 2 and must be U, R must be somewhere.

But I need to test other positions.

""POWER"" no U. Must have U at position 2.

So only words with U at 2.

Words like: ? U ? ? ?

With U at 2.

My guess must be a 5-letter word with U second.

Common ones: ""HOUSE"" but S and E gone.
""MOUSE"" S,E gone.
""ROUSE"" S,E gone.

""HOURI"" - but I is vowel? letters: H,U,R,I? Positions: H(1),U(2),R(3),I(4)? Not 5-letters? ""HOURI"" is 5? H-O-U-R-I? Wait spelling: HOURI is H-O-U-R-I? Actually, ""Houri"" is H-O-U-R-I? But O-U, position: H(1),O(2) not U. Wait U is 3rd? Incorrect.

Word must have U at position 2.

""GUIDE"" is G(1) U(2) I(3) D(4) E(5) but E gone.

""QUICK"" Q,U,I,C,K - C gone.

""BUILT"" B U I L T - T gone? T absent yes.

Available: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,V,W,X,Z but X,Z rare.

So common: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,V,W

Words with U at 2: e.g., 
H U M O R as above
D U C K Y - but C and Y gone.
B U L G E - E gone.
F U R O R - R at 3 and 5? F U R O R - F(1),U(2),R(3),O(4),R(5) — R at 3 and 5, and O. Letters: F,R,U,O — but F and O untested. And ""FUROR"" is a word? Yes, meaning frenzy.

Similarly, V U L V A? not common word.

""JUMBO"" J U M B O - no R? Not included R.

But R is missing: to include R or not? I don't have to, but it might be better to include R to pin down its position.

If I include R, in guess, I might get feedback on position.

In ""FUROR"": putting R at position 3 and 5? But we don't know if R appears twice? Possible, I think.

But untested letters F,O.

Another word: ""PURIM"" P U R I M - R at position 3. Letters P,U,R,I,M. Probes P,I,M.

Possible.

Similarly, ""CURIO"" C gone? Not.

Best options: 
1. ""HUMOR"": H U M O R - positions 1:H, 2:U(known), 3:M, 4:O, 5:R
   - Tests H, M, O, and R at 5.
   - R is at position 5.

2. ""FUROR"": F U R O R - positions 1:F, 2:U, 3:R, 4:O, 5:R
   - R at position 3 and 5? But if secret has one R, feedback might tell us more.

But duplicate R might complicate feedback.

Another word: ""DOUBT"" D O U B T - U is position 3? Not at 2.

No: must U at 2.

""JUMAR"" not English.

I think ""HUMOR"" is fine.

Also ""POURS"" S gone? No.

""DOGMA"" not U at 2.

So let's choose ""humor"".

But we have position: if R is at 5, and in secret it might not be.

But it could be.

Another word: ""BUDGE"" E gone.

""GOURD"" G O U R D - position: G(1) O(2) U(3) R(4) D(5) — O at position 2? No, U is at position 3, not 2. For secret, U at position 2.

Need U as second letter.

Final decision: ""HUMOR"" or ""PURIM"".

""PURIM"": P(1) U(2) R(3) I(4) M(5) — R at position 3.

Probes P,I,M,R.

I think both ok.

I'll go with ""humor"" to have different letters.

But in ""humor"", R is at position 5, which might be likely?

Since R position unknown, test R at position 3 with ""purim"".

""Purim"" is a proper noun? But valid in word games sometimes? Need common word.

""BUMPH"" not common.

Perhaps ""MULCT"" not with R.

Good word: ""BUDDY"" Y gone.

I think ""HUMOR"" is the safest.

So I'll guess ""HUMOR"".

<guess>humor</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - Meaning: C, A, N, E are absent from the secret word.
   - R is present but not in position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 and marked '-').

2. **Guess 2: rusty** → Feedback: R(-) U(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)
   - Meaning: R is present but not in position 1 (guessed in position 1).
   - U is in the word and correctly placed in position 2 (U(✓)).
   - S, T, Y are absent.

### Key deductions:
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, S, T, Y (cannot appear in the word).
- **Present letters**: 
  - R is in the word but must not be in position 1 or 2 (from feedback). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
  - U is confirmed in position 2 (✓ from ""rusty"").
- **Word structure**: Position 2 is U, and R is in position 3, 4, or 5 → Pattern: `_ U _ _ _`
- **Remaining letters**: Valid letters are those not excluded: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, V, W, X, Z (with vowels I and O being common).
- The secret word contains U (position 2), R (somewhere), and three other letters from the remaining pool.

### Strategy for this guess:
- **Confirm R's position**: Since R must be in position 3, 4, or 5, guess a word with R in one of these positions (e.g., position 3).
- **Maximize information**: Include common unused consonants (like M, H) and vowels (like O) to test more letters.
- **Avoid excluded letters**: Ensure no C, A, N, E, S, T, or Y is used.
- **Fix U in position 2**: Since U is confirmed, keep it in position 2.
- Prioritize words with high-frequency unused letters for broader coverage.

A strong candidate is **""purim""**:
- Structure: P(1) U(2) R(3) I(4) M(5)
- U in position 2 (confirmed) 
- R in position 3 (tests a possible position)
- Tests new letters: P (position 1), I (position 4, vowel probe), M (position 5)
- Uses 4 untested letters (P, R, I, M) efficiently.
- Word validity: ""Purim"" is a valid English word (5 letters).
- Feedback from this guess will:
  - Confirm if R is in position 3 (✓/ -), narrowing its possible placement.
  - Reveal if P, I, or M are present and in which positions.

<guess>purim</guess>",humor,"We have two guesses of feedback:
1. ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - This means: 
     - Letters not in word: C, A, N, E
     - R is in the word but not in position 2 (since in ""crane"" R is position 2)
2. ""rusty"" -> R(-) U(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)
   - Interpretation:
     - U is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 2, because in ""rusty"" U is position 2)
     - R is in the word but not in position 1 (since it shows R(-) and position 1 in this guess)
     - Letters not in word: S, T, Y

Combine the information:
- Confirmed absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, T, Y
- Present letters: R, U
- U is in position 2 (from second guess U(✓))

From first guess R(-): R is in the word but not position 2 (of ""crane"").
From second guess R(-): R is not in position 1 (of ""rusty"").
So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Additionally, U is fixed in position 2.

So the secret word structure: _ U _ _ _
And R is in one of positions 3,4,5.

Now, list all possible letters. Present: R,U. Absent: C,A,N,E,S,T,Y.
Excluded letters so far: C,A,N,E,S,T,Y

Remaining English letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,V,W,X,Z

But common letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,V,W

Possible vowels: I,O (since U is already in position 2, and A,E gone; Y also gone)

Now, we need to form a word: ? U ? ? ?
With one R in positions 3,4, or 5.

Since U is fixed at position 2, and R must be in 3,4, or 5.

For our next guess, we want to include R in a new position (3,4, or 5) and test other common letters.

We should prioritize:
- Place R not in position 1 or 2 (rule out 1 and 2), so only 3,4,5 possible. In our next guess, put R in position 3? But not necessarily the correct position, but to test.
- Also include other potential vowels or common consonants.

Possible words:
First, let's think of words matching ""_ U _ _ _"" with R somewhere.

But we also have eliminated many letters: no C,A,N,E,S,T,Y.

Examples: 
- If R in position 3: _ U R _ _
- If R in position 4: _ U _ R _
- If R in position 5: _ U _ _ R

e.g., CHURL? C and H, C gone? C absent; CH not a letter per se, but C is banned. ""CHURN"" has C? No, it starts with C — forbidden. ""MOURN"" M O U R N - N absent? N gone.
""POURS"" P O U R S - S absent.
""FOURTH"" too long.

U at 2, R at 5: _ U _ _ R
e.g., DOUBR? not word. HUMOR? H U M O R - O and M possible.
Similarly, VAPOR? V A P O R - A gone.
""SUDOR""? not common.
""JUMAR"" not common.
Valid: ""RUMOR"" but R is position 1, which we know is not R's position? But ""RUMOR"" has U position 2? Positions: R(1), U(2), M(3), O(4), R(5) - R at 1 and 5. But R must be in the word, and we know position 1 is not for R? From second guess, R at position 1 got '-', meaning R is not position 1, so secret R cannot be at position 1.

In secret word, position 1 cannot be R because in guess 2 R not position 1.

Therefore, words starting with R are invalid if R is at position 1? No-- the secret word might have R at multiple positions? Unlikely, but possible. But the feedback for guess ""rusty"" R at position 1 got '-', meaning the letter R is present but not in position 1. So in the secret word, R must exist, but not at position 1. Also, not position 2? From first guess, we know R not position 2 (because guess1 position2 R was incorrect), guess2 position1 R incorrect.

So R must be at 3,4, or5 in secret.

Now, for our next guess, we choose a word that: 
- Must include U at position 2 because we know it's correct (U(✓) from last guess). Actually, to verify? No, confirmed so U should be at position 2.

Additionally, include R in position 3,4, or 5 to test.

But since U is fixed, and R must be somewhere, perhaps try R in position 3 for example.

Also, avoid used letters: absent: C,A,N,E,S,T,Y

Possible vowel: O or I

Now, words: _ U R _ _ 
Examples: BURKA? not English.
PURDA? No.
Valid: ""HURON"" - proper? ""HURLY"" Y gone.
""GURLY"" not word.

_ U _ R _
Examples: ""QUART"" Q and A? A gone.
""BOURD""? rare.
""MOURD"" not word.

Better: _ U L R _ no.
Perhaps ""MULCH"" no R. ""MULCT""? M U L C T - C absent? C gone.
Tough.

_ U _ _ R
Examples: ""JUDGER"" too long? 6 letters.
""DUMAR"" not word.
Valid: ""HUMOR"" - H U M O R - letters: H,U,M,O,R
Position: H(1), U(2), M(3), O(4), R(5)
This works: no forbidden letters; positions: U at 2 is correct, R at position 5 which is possible.

Similarly, ""NUMBLY"" has N, gone.
""SUDOR"" not English.
""PUDOR"" perhaps.

But ""HUMOR"" is a valid word.

Another: ""RUMOR"" but R at position 1 which we cannot have? For our guess word, we can put R at position 1? But we know it's wrong. Yes, we can—it would waste a slot, but ""RUMOR"" positions: R(1),U(2),M(3),O(4),R(5) — U at 2 is fixed correct, R at 1 will be marked wrong (- or x? x because not present? no, R is present but at another position). Since R is present, placing it at position 1 would get '-', which we already know. But it occupies a spot that could be used for a new letter.

Similarly, R at 5 might be correct or not.

To maximize new letters, avoid putting R where we know it shouldn't be.

In next guess, put U at position 2 (fixed), then R in a position that might be correct, one of 3,4,5.

For ""HUMOR"": letters H,U,M,O,R
- All unused letters except U and R.
- Probes H, M, O.

Another possibility: ""LUPUS"" S absent? No S allowed.
""DUTCH"" not standard.

Possible words: 
- With O: since vowel needed, O is common.
""FUDOR"" not word.
""POUFF"" not.

Another valid word: ""COUTH"" but C gone? C absent.
""GUIDE"" E gone.

So ""HUMOR"" seems good.

Other options: ""BOUND"" O,U,N—N absent.
""MOULD"" O,U,L,D— no R? Not included R but we mustn't include R? We do not have to include R in every guess? To win, I need to guess the word, but I can guess words without R? But I know R is in the word, so to get green, I need to include it. And to get correct placement. But from rules, I can guess any word, but strategically, include known present letters to find position.

Since U is fixed at position 2 and must be U, R must be somewhere.

But I need to test other positions.

""POWER"" no U. Must have U at position 2.

So only words with U at 2.

Words like: ? U ? ? ?

With U at 2.

My guess must be a 5-letter word with U second.

Common ones: ""HOUSE"" but S and E gone.
""MOUSE"" S,E gone.
""ROUSE"" S,E gone.

""HOURI"" - but I is vowel? letters: H,U,R,I? Positions: H(1),U(2),R(3),I(4)? Not 5-letters? ""HOURI"" is 5? H-O-U-R-I? Wait spelling: HOURI is H-O-U-R-I? Actually, ""Houri"" is H-O-U-R-I? But O-U, position: H(1),O(2) not U. Wait U is 3rd? Incorrect.

Word must have U at position 2.

""GUIDE"" is G(1) U(2) I(3) D(4) E(5) but E gone.

""QUICK"" Q,U,I,C,K - C gone.

""BUILT"" B U I L T - T gone? T absent yes.

Available: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,V,W,X,Z but X,Z rare.

So common: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,V,W

Words with U at 2: e.g., 
H U M O R as above
D U C K Y - but C and Y gone.
B U L G E - E gone.
F U R O R - R at 3 and 5? F U R O R - F(1),U(2),R(3),O(4),R(5) — R at 3 and 5, and O. Letters: F,R,U,O — but F and O untested. And ""FUROR"" is a word? Yes, meaning frenzy.

Similarly, V U L V A? not common word.

""JUMBO"" J U M B O - no R? Not included R.

But R is missing: to include R or not? I don't have to, but it might be better to include R to pin down its position.

If I include R, in guess, I might get feedback on position.

In ""FUROR"": putting R at position 3 and 5? But we don't know if R appears twice? Possible, I think.

But untested letters F,O.

Another word: ""PURIM"" P U R I M - R at position 3. Letters P,U,R,I,M. Probes P,I,M.

Possible.

Similarly, ""CURIO"" C gone? Not.

Best options: 
1. ""HUMOR"": H U M O R - positions 1:H, 2:U(known), 3:M, 4:O, 5:R
   - Tests H, M, O, and R at 5.
   - R is at position 5.

2. ""FUROR"": F U R O R - positions 1:F, 2:U, 3:R, 4:O, 5:R
   - R at position 3 and 5? But if secret has one R, feedback might tell us more.

But duplicate R might complicate feedback.

Another word: ""DOUBT"" D O U B T - U is position 3? Not at 2.

No: must U at 2.

""JUMAR"" not English.

I think ""HUMOR"" is fine.

Also ""POURS"" S gone? No.

""DOGMA"" not U at 2.

So let's choose ""humor"".

But we have position: if R is at 5, and in secret it might not be.

But it could be.

Another word: ""BUDGE"" E gone.

""GOURD"" G O U R D - position: G(1) O(2) U(3) R(4) D(5) — O at position 2? No, U is at position 3, not 2. For secret, U at position 2.

Need U as second letter.

Final decision: ""HUMOR"" or ""PURIM"".

""PURIM"": P(1) U(2) R(3) I(4) M(5) — R at position 3.

Probes P,I,M,R.

I think both ok.

I'll go with ""humor"" to have different letters.

But in ""humor"", R is at position 5, which might be likely?

Since R position unknown, test R at position 3 with ""purim"".

""Purim"" is a proper noun? But valid in word games sometimes? Need common word.

""BUMPH"" not common.

Perhaps ""MULCT"" not with R.

Good word: ""BUDDY"" Y gone.

I think ""HUMOR"" is the safest.

So I'll guess ""HUMOR"".

<guess>humor</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - Meaning: C, A, N, E are absent from the secret word.
   - R is present but not in position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 and marked '-').

2. **Guess 2: rusty** → Feedback: R(-) U(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)
   - Meaning: R is present but not in position 1 (guessed in position 1).
   - U is in the word and correctly placed in position 2 (U(✓)).
   - S, T, Y are absent.

### Key deductions:
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, S, T, Y (cannot appear in the word).
- **Present letters**: 
  - R is in the word but must not be in position 1 or 2 (from feedback). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
  - U is confirmed in position 2 (✓ from ""rusty"").
- **Word structure**: Position 2 is U, and R is in position 3, 4, or 5 → Pattern: `_ U _ _ _`
- **Remaining letters**: Valid letters are those not excluded: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, V, W, X, Z (with vowels I and O being common).
- The secret word contains U (position 2), R (somewhere), and three other letters from the remaining pool.

### Strategy for this guess:
- **Confirm R's position**: Since R must be in position 3, 4, or 5, guess a word with R in one of these positions (e.g., position 3).
- **Maximize information**: Include common unused consonants (like M, H) and vowels (like O) to test more letters.
- **Avoid excluded letters**: Ensure no C, A, N, E, S, T, or Y is used.
- **Fix U in position 2**: Since U is confirmed, keep it in position 2.
- Prioritize words with high-frequency unused letters for broader coverage.

A strong candidate is **""purim""**:
- Structure: P(1) U(2) R(3) I(4) M(5)
- U in position 2 (confirmed) 
- R in position 3 (tests a possible position)
- Tests new letters: P (position 1), I (position 4, vowel probe), M (position 5)
- Uses 4 untested letters (P, R, I, M) efficiently.
- Word validity: ""Purim"" is a valid English word (5 letters).
- Feedback from this guess will:
  - Confirm if R is in position 3 (✓/ -), narrowing its possible placement.
  - Reveal if P, I, or M are present and in which positions.",Guess 3: humor -> FEEDBACK: H(x) U(✓) M(x) O(x) R(-),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to make an initial guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means selecting a word with common letters that might appear in many words, and ideally, using letters that are frequently used in English.

Common starting words in games like Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", or ""ADIEU"" because they use a mix of vowels and common consonants. Vowels are important since most words have vowels, and consonants like S, T, R, N, L are common.

Let me list out some high-frequency letters in English 5-letter words:

- Vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y)

- Consonants: S, T, R, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

A good starter word should have diverse letters to cover more possibilities. For example, ""ADIEU"" uses A, D, I, E, U – that's four vowels and one consonant, which might be good for checking vowels but not so much for consonants. Since vowels are limited (only 5-6), it might be better to have a balance.

""CRANE"" is popular: C, R, A, N, E – has two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N). Good mix.

""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (S, L, T).

""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T – two vowels (O, A) and three consonants (R, S, T).

Since I'm the one guessing, and this is the first turn, any of these should be fine. But let me choose one.

I think ""CRANE"" is a solid choice because C, R, A, N, E are all fairly common letters. E is the most common letter in English, A is also very common, and R, S, T are high-frequency consonants. In ""CRANE"", I have E which is common, A is common, R is common, N is common, C is less common but still useful.

Another option is ""RAISE"" – R, A, I, S, E – which has three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S). But S and R are common.

To avoid duplication, I should pick a word without repeated letters, which all these examples have.

For the first guess, I'll go with ""CRANE"". It's a standard opener.

So, my guessed word is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let me process the feedback from the first guess to inform my next move. The word was ""CRANE"" and the feedback was: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x). 

First, breaking this down:
- C, A, N, E are marked as 'x' – these letters are definitely not in the secret word. That means the word has no C, A, N, or E at all.  
- R is marked as '-', meaning R is in the word but not in the second position (since in ""CRANE"", R is in position 2). So R is present, and its correct position is somewhere else—positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Since A, E are vowels, and they’re excluded, the secret word likely uses other vowels like I, O, U, or sometimes Y. Also, with E eliminated—a very common letter—this narrows down possibilities significantly.  

Now, I need a new guess that:
1. Avoids C, A, N, E entirely (since they’re 'x').  
2. Includes R (because it’s confirmed present).  
3. Places R not in position 2, so it should be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
4. Uses other common letters to probe for more information.  

Considering vowel possibilities: with A and E out, common vowels left are I, O, U. Y could also act as a vowel. Consonants like S, T, L, M, P, D are good candidates since they're frequent.  

Possible words:  
- Since R is confirmed, start with words containing R and other high-frequency letters.  
- Avoid reused positions: in my next guess, R shouldn’t be in position 2.  

Good candidate words:  
- ""ROUST"": R in position 1, O,U,S,T. But O and U are vowels. R could be in position 1 here.  
- ""SPRIG"": Has R in position 3. Includes S,P,I,G—probes I and G.  
- First, I need to cover vowel gaps. Since A/E are out, focus on I or O/U.  

Strong options:  
""PIOUS"": Includes I,O,U—but no R, and R is necessary. Must include R.  
So reject ""PIOUS"".  

""ROBIN"": R in position 1 (position 2 is O—not R), B,I,N. But N was 'x' from last guess, so N can't be used. N is excluded.  
Similarly, avoid A,N,E,C.  

""ROTIS"" – not a word.  
Actual words only.  

""WORDY"": Has R in position 4 (W,O,R,D,Y). Uses O,Y as vowels. Tests multiple others.  

Better idea: Prioritize words with R and vowels like I/O.  

""SHIRT"": S,H,I,R,T – R in position 4. Positions: S(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), T(5). This has I as a vowel and probes S,H,T.  

Or ""SPORT"": S,P,O,R,T – R in position 4.  

But maybe words with R in different positions to test placement.  

Another common starting word after elimination: ""SLIMY"" – but no R. Must include R.  

So constrained: must have R, no C,A,N,E.  

List of helpful letters: S,T,L,I,O,M,P,D,B,G,F,V,K,H – and R confirmed.  

Optimal: include R and untested vowels/consonants.  

""GRIMP"" – not common.  

""PRISM"": P,R,I,S,M – R in position 2? Wait, position 2 is R in ""PRISM"". But feedback said R is not in position 2, so in my guess, I should avoid placing R in position 2 to honor what we know. Even though it's a guess, I can choose not to put R there.  

In feedback, R is in word but not pos2, so for my next guess, I can place R elsewhere to test potential positions.  

""PRISM"" has R in pos2—if I use it, and if secret R is truly not there, I'll get - or x for R? No: rules say the symbol means for the letter: if in word but wrong position, it's '-', regardless of where I place it if incorrect. But since I know it’s not in pos2, I should avoid putting it there to avoid wasting a position.  

By placing R elsewhere, say pos1, I can get clearer feedback: if secret R is in pos1, I'd get ✓, or if not pos1, '-'.  

So better to place R in a new position. In ""CRANE"", pos2 was wrong, so place R in 1,3,4,5.  

Possible words:  
- Pos1: ""ROSTS"" invalid; ""ROAST"" but has A which is excluded—A is 'x', so no.  

""ROUGE""—has E? E is excluded.  

""ROUGH"": R,O,U,G,H – no E/N/A/C. R in 1. Probes O,U,G,H.  

""PLUMB""—no R. Must include R.  

""DOUGH""—has O,U,G,H but no R.  

""CRUFT""—has C? C eliminated.  

So avoid banned letters.  

Brainstorm: R + vowels I/O/U/Y + consonants not C,A,N,E.  

""BRISK"": B,R,I,S,K – R in position 2? Position 2 would be R again, which we know is wrong place. In ""BRISK"", R is pos2, same as before—I should avoid that to not reuse the incorrect position.  

Place R elsewhere.  

""RISKY"": Positions: R(1), I(2), S(3), K(4), Y(5) – R in pos1. Avoids pos2. Tests I,Y,S,K.  

Or ""BIROS"": B,I,R,O,S – R in pos3.  

But ""BIROS"" might be rare.  

Popular choice: ""SPIRT"" – variant? ""SPIRY""? Not ideal.  

Better: ""SHORT"": S,H,O,R,T – R in position 4. Places R not in pos2, probes S,H,O,T.  

""SHORT"" has O as vowel.  

""ROTED"" – not word.  

""SIRLO"": invalid.  

""WORDS"": W,O,R,D,S – R in pos3. Letters: W,O,D,S—all untested.  

But S is very common, so probing S is good.  

""TRIPS"": T,R,I,P,S – R in position 2? Positions: T(1), R(2), etc. Oh, R is in pos2 again. Avoid—since feedback says R not pos2, I shouldn't reuse that spot.  

In ""TRIPS"", R is in pos2, which I know is incorrect, so it would be inefficient.  

Choose words where R is in 1,3,4,5.  

E.g., position 1: ""RUSTS"" not 5-letter word; ""RUSTY"" – R,U,S,T,Y – R in 1, tests U,Y,T,S. S and T are common.  

""RUSTY"" makes sense as a word.  

Position 5 e.g., ""AZURE"" but A excluded—invalid.  

""STARE"" has E and A—excluded.  

So ""RUSTY"" seems decent: letters R,U,S,T,Y—all valid, no banned letters. R pos1 is new.  

Another option: ""POLAR"" has A—excluded.  

""GUILD"" no R.  

""BIRDS"": B,I,R,D,S – R in pos3. Avoids pos2. Tests B,I,D,S.  

But D and B less common—prioritize high-frequency like S,T,L.  

""FJORD"" – J not common, O used.  

Best: since S,T,U,L are untested, include them.  

""ROILS"": R,O,I,L,S – R in pos1, positions avoid 2.  

""ROILS"" is a word? Roils means disturbs, valid. Letters: R,O,I,L,S—tests O,I,L,S.  

""SPOIL"": S,P,O,I,L – no R. But need R.  

Must include R.  

So ""ROILS"" or ""RUSTY"".  

""RUSTY"": R,U,S,T,Y – consonants S,T, vowels U,Y.  

""ROILS"": R,O,I,L,S – vowels O,I, consonants L,S.  

Both seem fine.  

Since original had no vowels (A,E gone), likely U or O/I present. Y can be vowel.  

""RUSTY"" gives more consonant coverage: S and T are very high frequency.  

In ""RUSTY"": U is vowel, Y can be vowel/consonant, but positionally at end, often vowel sound.  

Similarly, ""TRUMP"" has U but M,P—but ""TRUMP"" places R in pos2 if T first.  

Let's avoid pos2 for R.  

""TURFS"" – has F,S; R in pos3.  

But less common word.  

Stick with ""RUSTY"" or ""LOURS"" invalid.  

""WORDY"": W,O,R,D,Y – R in pos3. Tests W,O,D,Y—W lower frequency.  

Better to cover common letters.  

I think ""RUSHY"" not word.  

Standard next guess could be with S and T.  

Since R is confirmed and not pos2, aim to cover where R might be.  

Also, secret word has R but not in pos2, and no C,A,N,E—so possible letters.  

For maximum info, use a word with R in another position and include new vowels.  

Ultimately, I'll go with ""RUSTY"" – it has R in position 1 (new), S,T which are very common and untested, U as vowel, Y as semi-vowel. This covers different angles and could yield good feedback.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, E are **not** in the secret word (all marked 'x'). This means the word contains none of these letters.
- R **is** in the word but not in the second position (marked '-'). So R must appear in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

For the next guess:
- Must avoid C, A, N, E entirely.
- Must include R.
- Should place R in a position other than 2 (position 1, 3, 4, or 5) to test alternative placements and gather more info.
- Prioritize high-frequency unused letters (like S, T, I, O, U, L, M) and vowels other than A/E (e.g., I, O, U, Y).

A strong candidate is ""rusty"":
- **R** in position 1 (tests a new position for R).
- Includes **U** and **Y** as potential vowels (since A/E are out).
- Includes **S** and **T**, which are high-frequency consonants.
- Avoids banned letters (C, A, N, E) and uses common unused characters.

This guess efficiently probes the presence of S, T, U, and Y while leveraging the confirmed R. The feedback will clarify R's true position and reveal if S, T, U, or Y are present.

<guess>rusty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: rusty -> FEEDBACK: R(-) U(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses of feedback:
1. ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - This means: 
     - Letters not in word: C, A, N, E
     - R is in the word but not in position 2 (since in ""crane"" R is position 2)
2. ""rusty"" -> R(-) U(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)
   - Interpretation:
     - U is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 2, because in ""rusty"" U is position 2)
     - R is in the word but not in position 1 (since it shows R(-) and position 1 in this guess)
     - Letters not in word: S, T, Y

Combine the information:
- Confirmed absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, T, Y
- Present letters: R, U
- U is in position 2 (from second guess U(✓))

From first guess R(-): R is in the word but not position 2 (of ""crane"").
From second guess R(-): R is not in position 1 (of ""rusty"").
So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Additionally, U is fixed in position 2.

So the secret word structure: _ U _ _ _
And R is in one of positions 3,4,5.

Now, list all possible letters. Present: R,U. Absent: C,A,N,E,S,T,Y.
Excluded letters so far: C,A,N,E,S,T,Y

Remaining English letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,V,W,X,Z

But common letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,V,W

Possible vowels: I,O (since U is already in position 2, and A,E gone; Y also gone)

Now, we need to form a word: ? U ? ? ?
With one R in positions 3,4, or 5.

Since U is fixed at position 2, and R must be in 3,4, or 5.

For our next guess, we want to include R in a new position (3,4, or 5) and test other common letters.

We should prioritize:
- Place R not in position 1 or 2 (rule out 1 and 2), so only 3,4,5 possible. In our next guess, put R in position 3? But not necessarily the correct position, but to test.
- Also include other potential vowels or common consonants.

Possible words:
First, let's think of words matching ""_ U _ _ _"" with R somewhere.

But we also have eliminated many letters: no C,A,N,E,S,T,Y.

Examples: 
- If R in position 3: _ U R _ _
- If R in position 4: _ U _ R _
- If R in position 5: _ U _ _ R

Find valid 5-letter English words fitting these.

_ U R _ _ : possibilities:
Bully? B U L L Y - but Y is gone (absent). Invalid.
Curly? C and Y gone. Invalid.
Furry? F U R R Y - Y gone, and R repeated? but we don't know about doubles yet. However, R might be double, but feedback didn't indicate that. Also, we have R only once so far in guesses, so it could be double. But Y is gone.
Purge? P U R G E - E is absent. Invalid.
Guild? G U I L D - has no R? Wait, if pattern U R, not.

Position: _ U R _ _
Words: Could be ""CURSE"" but C and S gone. ""FURSE"" not word.
""PURGE"" has E, gone.
""LOURD""? not common.
Possible: ""BURMA"": B U R M A - but A gone.
""AURIC"" A gone.
""OURIE"" not word? no.
Better: ""JUDGE"" no R.
Perhaps R in other positions.

_ U _ R _ : examples:
Curds? C gone.
Furls? F U R L S - S absent.
Gourmet too long.
Demur? D E M U R - E gone, and 4 letters? not 5.
Lured? L U R E D - E gone.
Words ending with U:R not common.

Better search for words with U in position 2 and R later.

List of possible words: ignoring duplicate R for now.

With U at 2, R at 3: e.g., BURLY - but Y absent.
PURIM - but M possible? letters: P,U,R,I,M - I and M untested.

Similarly, U at 2, R at 4: _ U _ R _
e.g., CHURL? C and H, C gone? C absent; CH not a letter per se, but C is banned. ""CHURN"" has C? No, it starts with C — forbidden. ""MOURN"" M O U R N - N absent? N gone.
""POURS"" P O U R S - S absent.
""FOURTH"" too long.

U at 2, R at 5: _ U _ _ R
e.g., DOUBR? not word. HUMOR? H U M O R - O and M possible.
Similarly, VAPOR? V A P O R - A gone.
""SUDOR""? not common.
""JUMAR"" not common.
Valid: ""RUMOR"" but R is position 1, which we know is not R's position? But ""RUMOR"" has U position 2? Positions: R(1), U(2), M(3), O(4), R(5) - R at 1 and 5. But R must be in the word, and we know position 1 is not for R? From second guess, R at position 1 got '-', meaning R is not position 1, so secret R cannot be at position 1.

In secret word, position 1 cannot be R because in guess 2 R not position 1.

Therefore, words starting with R are invalid if R is at position 1? No-- the secret word might have R at multiple positions? Unlikely, but possible. But the feedback for guess ""rusty"" R at position 1 got '-', meaning the letter R is present but not in position 1. So in the secret word, R must exist, but not at position 1. Also, not position 2? From first guess, we know R not position 2 (because guess1 position2 R was incorrect), guess2 position1 R incorrect.

So R must be at 3,4, or5 in secret.

Now, for our next guess, we choose a word that: 
- Must include U at position 2 because we know it's correct (U(✓) from last guess). Actually, to verify? No, confirmed so U should be at position 2.

Additionally, include R in position 3,4, or 5 to test.

But since U is fixed, and R must be somewhere, perhaps try R in position 3 for example.

Also, avoid used letters: absent: C,A,N,E,S,T,Y

Possible vowel: O or I

Now, words: _ U R _ _ 
Examples: BURKA? not English.
PURDA? No.
Valid: ""HURON"" - proper? ""HURLY"" Y gone.
""GURLY"" not word.

_ U _ R _
Examples: ""QUART"" Q and A? A gone.
""BOURD""? rare.
""MOURD"" not word.

Better: _ U L R _ no.
Perhaps ""MULCH"" no R. ""MULCT""? M U L C T - C absent? C gone.
Tough.

_ U _ _ R
Examples: ""JUDGER"" too long? 6 letters.
""DUMAR"" not word.
Valid: ""HUMOR"" - H U M O R - letters: H,U,M,O,R
Position: H(1), U(2), M(3), O(4), R(5)
This works: no forbidden letters; positions: U at 2 is correct, R at position 5 which is possible.

Similarly, ""NUMBLY"" has N, gone.
""SUDOR"" not English.
""PUDOR"" perhaps.

But ""HUMOR"" is a valid word.

Another: ""RUMOR"" but R at position 1 which we cannot have? For our guess word, we can put R at position 1? But we know it's wrong. Yes, we can—it would waste a slot, but ""RUMOR"" positions: R(1),U(2),M(3),O(4),R(5) — U at 2 is fixed correct, R at 1 will be marked wrong (- or x? x because not present? no, R is present but at another position). Since R is present, placing it at position 1 would get '-', which we already know. But it occupies a spot that could be used for a new letter.

Similarly, R at 5 might be correct or not.

To maximize new letters, avoid putting R where we know it shouldn't be.

In next guess, put U at position 2 (fixed), then R in a position that might be correct, one of 3,4,5.

For ""HUMOR"": letters H,U,M,O,R
- All unused letters except U and R.
- Probes H, M, O.

Another possibility: ""LUPUS"" S absent? No S allowed.
""DUTCH"" not standard.

Possible words: 
- With O: since vowel needed, O is common.
""FUDOR"" not word.
""POUFF"" not.

Another valid word: ""COUTH"" but C gone? C absent.
""GUIDE"" E gone.

So ""HUMOR"" seems good.

Other options: ""BOUND"" O,U,N—N absent.
""MOULD"" O,U,L,D— no R? Not included R but we mustn't include R? We do not have to include R in every guess? To win, I need to guess the word, but I can guess words without R? But I know R is in the word, so to get green, I need to include it. And to get correct placement. But from rules, I can guess any word, but strategically, include known present letters to find position.

Since U is fixed at position 2 and must be U, R must be somewhere.

But I need to test other positions.

""POWER"" no U. Must have U at position 2.

So only words with U at 2.

Words like: ? U ? ? ?

With U at 2.

My guess must be a 5-letter word with U second.

Common ones: ""HOUSE"" but S and E gone.
""MOUSE"" S,E gone.
""ROUSE"" S,E gone.

""HOURI"" - but I is vowel? letters: H,U,R,I? Positions: H(1),U(2),R(3),I(4)? Not 5-letters? ""HOURI"" is 5? H-O-U-R-I? Wait spelling: HOURI is H-O-U-R-I? Actually, ""Houri"" is H-O-U-R-I? But O-U, position: H(1),O(2) not U. Wait U is 3rd? Incorrect.

Word must have U at position 2.

""GUIDE"" is G(1) U(2) I(3) D(4) E(5) but E gone.

""QUICK"" Q,U,I,C,K - C gone.

""BUILT"" B U I L T - T gone? T absent yes.

Available: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,V,W,X,Z but X,Z rare.

So common: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,V,W

Words with U at 2: e.g., 
H U M O R as above
D U C K Y - but C and Y gone.
B U L G E - E gone.
F U R O R - R at 3 and 5? F U R O R - F(1),U(2),R(3),O(4),R(5) — R at 3 and 5, and O. Letters: F,R,U,O — but F and O untested. And ""FUROR"" is a word? Yes, meaning frenzy.

Similarly, V U L V A? not common word.

""JUMBO"" J U M B O - no R? Not included R.

But R is missing: to include R or not? I don't have to, but it might be better to include R to pin down its position.

If I include R, in guess, I might get feedback on position.

In ""FUROR"": putting R at position 3 and 5? But we don't know if R appears twice? Possible, I think.

But untested letters F,O.

Another word: ""PURIM"" P U R I M - R at position 3. Letters P,U,R,I,M. Probes P,I,M.

Possible.

Similarly, ""CURIO"" C gone? Not.

Best options: 
1. ""HUMOR"": H U M O R - positions 1:H, 2:U(known), 3:M, 4:O, 5:R
   - Tests H, M, O, and R at 5.
   - R is at position 5.

2. ""FUROR"": F U R O R - positions 1:F, 2:U, 3:R, 4:O, 5:R
   - R at position 3 and 5? But if secret has one R, feedback might tell us more.

But duplicate R might complicate feedback.

Another word: ""DOUBT"" D O U B T - U is position 3? Not at 2.

No: must U at 2.

""JUMAR"" not English.

I think ""HUMOR"" is fine.

Also ""POURS"" S gone? No.

""DOGMA"" not U at 2.

So let's choose ""humor"".

But we have position: if R is at 5, and in secret it might not be.

But it could be.

Another word: ""BUDGE"" E gone.

""GOURD"" G O U R D - position: G(1) O(2) U(3) R(4) D(5) — O at position 2? No, U is at position 3, not 2. For secret, U at position 2.

Need U as second letter.

Final decision: ""HUMOR"" or ""PURIM"".

""PURIM"": P(1) U(2) R(3) I(4) M(5) — R at position 3.

Probes P,I,M,R.

I think both ok.

I'll go with ""humor"" to have different letters.

But in ""humor"", R is at position 5, which might be likely?

Since R position unknown, test R at position 3 with ""purim"".

""Purim"" is a proper noun? But valid in word games sometimes? Need common word.

""BUMPH"" not common.

Perhaps ""MULCT"" not with R.

Good word: ""BUDDY"" Y gone.

I think ""HUMOR"" is the safest.

So I'll guess ""HUMOR"".

<guess>humor</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - Meaning: C, A, N, E are absent from the secret word.
   - R is present but not in position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 and marked '-').

2. **Guess 2: rusty** → Feedback: R(-) U(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)
   - Meaning: R is present but not in position 1 (guessed in position 1).
   - U is in the word and correctly placed in position 2 (U(✓)).
   - S, T, Y are absent.

### Key deductions:
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, S, T, Y (cannot appear in the word).
- **Present letters**: 
  - R is in the word but must not be in position 1 or 2 (from feedback). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
  - U is confirmed in position 2 (✓ from ""rusty"").
- **Word structure**: Position 2 is U, and R is in position 3, 4, or 5 → Pattern: `_ U _ _ _`
- **Remaining letters**: Valid letters are those not excluded: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, V, W, X, Z (with vowels I and O being common).
- The secret word contains U (position 2), R (somewhere), and three other letters from the remaining pool.

### Strategy for this guess:
- **Confirm R's position**: Since R must be in position 3, 4, or 5, guess a word with R in one of these positions (e.g., position 3).
- **Maximize information**: Include common unused consonants (like M, H) and vowels (like O) to test more letters.
- **Avoid excluded letters**: Ensure no C, A, N, E, S, T, or Y is used.
- **Fix U in position 2**: Since U is confirmed, keep it in position 2.
- Prioritize words with high-frequency unused letters for broader coverage.

A strong candidate is **""purim""**:
- Structure: P(1) U(2) R(3) I(4) M(5)
- U in position 2 (confirmed) 
- R in position 3 (tests a possible position)
- Tests new letters: P (position 1), I (position 4, vowel probe), M (position 5)
- Uses 4 untested letters (P, R, I, M) efficiently.
- Word validity: ""Purim"" is a valid English word (5 letters).
- Feedback from this guess will:
  - Confirm if R is in position 3 (✓/ -), narrowing its possible placement.
  - Reveal if P, I, or M are present and in which positions.

Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means selecting a word with common letters that might appear in many words, and ideally, using letters that are frequently used in English.\n\nCommon starting words in games like Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", or ""ADIEU"" because they use a mix of vowels and common consonants. Vowels are important since most words have vowels, and consonants like S, T, R, N, L are common.\n\nLet me list out some high-frequency letters in English 5-letter words:\n\n- Vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y)\n\n- Consonants: S, T, R, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.\n\nA good starter word should have diverse letters to cover more possibilities. For example, ""ADIEU"" uses A, D, I, E, U – that\'s four vowels and one consonant, which might be good for checking vowels but not so much for consonants. Since vowels are limited (only 5-6), it might be better to have a balance.\n\n""CRANE"" is popular: C, R, A, N, E – has two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N). Good mix.\n\n""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (S, L, T).\n\n""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T – two vowels (O, A) and three consonants (R, S, T).\n\nSince I\'m the one guessing, and this is the first turn, any of these should be fine. But let me choose one.\n\nI think ""CRANE"" is a solid choice because C, R, A, N, E are all fairly common letters. E is the most common letter in English, A is also very common, and R, S, T are high-frequency consonants. In ""CRANE"", I have E which is common, A is common, R is common, N is common, C is less common but still useful.\n\nAnother option is ""RAISE"" – R, A, I, S, E – which has three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S). But S and R are common.\n\nTo avoid duplication, I should pick a word without repeated letters, which all these examples have.\n\nFor the first guess, I\'ll go with ""CRANE"". It\'s a standard opener.\n\nSo, my guessed word is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Alright, let me process the feedback from the first guess to inform my next move. The word was ""CRANE"" and the feedback was: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x). \n\nFirst, breaking this down:\n- C, A, N, E are marked as \'x\' – these letters are definitely not in the secret word. That means the word has no C, A, N, or E at all.  \n- R is marked as \'-\', meaning R is in the word but not in the second position (since in ""CRANE"", R is in position 2). So R is present, and its correct position is somewhere else—positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nSince A, E are vowels, and they’re excluded, the secret word likely uses other vowels like I, O, U, or sometimes Y. Also, with E eliminated—a very common letter—this narrows down possibilities significantly.  \n\nNow, I need a new guess that:\n1. Avoids C, A, N, E entirely (since they’re \'x\').  \n2. Includes R (because it’s confirmed present).  \n3. Places R not in position 2, so it should be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.  \n4. Uses other common letters to probe for more information.  \n\nConsidering vowel possibilities: with A and E out, common vowels left are I, O, U. Y could also act as a vowel. Consonants like S, T, L, M, P, D are good candidates since they\'re frequent.  \n\nPossible words:  \n- Since R is confirmed, start with words containing R and other high-frequency letters.  \n- Avoid reused positions: in my next guess, R shouldn’t be in position 2.  \n\nGood candidate words:  \n- ""ROUST"": R in position 1, O,U,S,T. But O and U are vowels. R could be in position 1 here.  \n- ""SPRIG"": Has R in position 3. Includes S,P,I,G—probes I and G.  \n- First, I need to cover vowel gaps. Since A/E are out, focus on I or O/U.  \n\nStrong options:  \n""PIOUS"": Includes I,O,U—but no R, and R is necessary. Must include R.  \nSo reject ""PIOUS"".  \n\n""ROBIN"": R in position 1 (position 2 is O—not R), B,I,N. But N was \'x\' from last guess, so N can\'t be used. N is excluded.  \nSimilarly, avoid A,N,E,C.  \n\n""ROTIS"" – not a word.  \nActual words only.  \n\n""WORDY"": Has R in position 4 (W,O,R,D,Y). Uses O,Y as vowels. Tests multiple others.  \n\nBetter idea: Prioritize words with R and vowels like I/O.  \n\n""SHIRT"": S,H,I,R,T – R in position 4. Positions: S(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), T(5). This has I as a vowel and probes S,H,T.  \n\nOr ""SPORT"": S,P,O,R,T – R in position 4.  \n\nBut maybe words with R in different positions to test placement.  \n\nAnother common starting word after elimination: ""SLIMY"" – but no R. Must include R.  \n\nSo constrained: must have R, no C,A,N,E.  \n\nList of helpful letters: S,T,L,I,O,M,P,D,B,G,F,V,K,H – and R confirmed.  \n\nOptimal: include R and untested vowels/consonants.  \n\n""GRIMP"" – not common.  \n\n""PRISM"": P,R,I,S,M – R in position 2? Wait, position 2 is R in ""PRISM"". But feedback said R is not in position 2, so in my guess, I should avoid placing R in position 2 to honor what we know. Even though it\'s a guess, I can choose not to put R there.  \n\nIn feedback, R is in word but not pos2, so for my next guess, I can place R elsewhere to test potential positions.  \n\n""PRISM"" has R in pos2—if I use it, and if secret R is truly not there, I\'ll get - or x for R? No: rules say the symbol means for the letter: if in word but wrong position, it\'s \'-\', regardless of where I place it if incorrect. But since I know it’s not in pos2, I should avoid putting it there to avoid wasting a position.  \n\nBy placing R elsewhere, say pos1, I can get clearer feedback: if secret R is in pos1, I\'d get ✓, or if not pos1, \'-\'.  \n\nSo better to place R in a new position. In ""CRANE"", pos2 was wrong, so place R in 1,3,4,5.  \n\nPossible words:  \n- Pos1: ""ROSTS"" invalid; ""ROAST"" but has A which is excluded—A is \'x\', so no.  \n\n""ROUGE""—has E? E is excluded.  \n\n""ROUGH"": R,O,U,G,H – no E/N/A/C. R in 1. Probes O,U,G,H.  \n\n""PLUMB""—no R. Must include R.  \n\n""DOUGH""—has O,U,G,H but no R.  \n\n""CRUFT""—has C? C eliminated.  \n\nSo avoid banned letters.  \n\nBrainstorm: R + vowels I/O/U/Y + consonants not C,A,N,E.  \n\n""BRISK"": B,R,I,S,K – R in position 2? Position 2 would be R again, which we know is wrong place. In ""BRISK"", R is pos2, same as before—I should avoid that to not reuse the incorrect position.  \n\nPlace R elsewhere.  \n\n""RISKY"": Positions: R(1), I(2), S(3), K(4), Y(5) – R in pos1. Avoids pos2. Tests I,Y,S,K.  \n\nOr ""BIROS"": B,I,R,O,S – R in pos3.  \n\nBut ""BIROS"" might be rare.  \n\nPopular choice: ""SPIRT"" – variant? ""SPIRY""? Not ideal.  \n\nBetter: ""SHORT"": S,H,O,R,T – R in position 4. Places R not in pos2, probes S,H,O,T.  \n\n""SHORT"" has O as vowel.  \n\n""ROTED"" – not word.  \n\n""SIRLO"": invalid.  \n\n""WORDS"": W,O,R,D,S – R in pos3. Letters: W,O,D,S—all untested.  \n\nBut S is very common, so probing S is good.  \n\n""TRIPS"": T,R,I,P,S – R in position 2? Positions: T(1), R(2), etc. Oh, R is in pos2 again. Avoid—since feedback says R not pos2, I shouldn\'t reuse that spot.  \n\nIn ""TRIPS"", R is in pos2, which I know is incorrect, so it would be inefficient.  \n\nChoose words where R is in 1,3,4,5.  \n\nE.g., position 1: ""RUSTS"" not 5-letter word; ""RUSTY"" – R,U,S,T,Y – R in 1, tests U,Y,T,S. S and T are common.  \n\n""RUSTY"" makes sense as a word.  \n\nPosition 5 e.g., ""AZURE"" but A excluded—invalid.  \n\n""STARE"" has E and A—excluded.  \n\nSo ""RUSTY"" seems decent: letters R,U,S,T,Y—all valid, no banned letters. R pos1 is new.  \n\nAnother option: ""POLAR"" has A—excluded.  \n\n""GUILD"" no R.  \n\n""BIRDS"": B,I,R,D,S – R in pos3. Avoids pos2. Tests B,I,D,S.  \n\nBut D and B less common—prioritize high-frequency like S,T,L.  \n\n""FJORD"" – J not common, O used.  \n\nBest: since S,T,U,L are untested, include them.  \n\n""ROILS"": R,O,I,L,S – R in pos1, positions avoid 2.  \n\n""ROILS"" is a word? Roils means disturbs, valid. Letters: R,O,I,L,S—tests O,I,L,S.  \n\n""SPOIL"": S,P,O,I,L – no R. But need R.  \n\nMust include R.  \n\nSo ""ROILS"" or ""RUSTY"".  \n\n""RUSTY"": R,U,S,T,Y – consonants S,T, vowels U,Y.  \n\n""ROILS"": R,O,I,L,S – vowels O,I, consonants L,S.  \n\nBoth seem fine.  \n\nSince original had no vowels (A,E gone), likely U or O/I present. Y can be vowel.  \n\n""RUSTY"" gives more consonant coverage: S and T are very high frequency.  \n\nIn ""RUSTY"": U is vowel, Y can be vowel/consonant, but positionally at end, often vowel sound.  \n\nSimilarly, ""TRUMP"" has U but M,P—but ""TRUMP"" places R in pos2 if T first.  \n\nLet\'s avoid pos2 for R.  \n\n""TURFS"" – has F,S; R in pos3.  \n\nBut less common word.  \n\nStick with ""RUSTY"" or ""LOURS"" invalid.  \n\n""WORDY"": W,O,R,D,Y – R in pos3. Tests W,O,D,Y—W lower frequency.  \n\nBetter to cover common letters.  \n\nI think ""RUSHY"" not word.  \n\nStandard next guess could be with S and T.  \n\nSince R is confirmed and not pos2, aim to cover where R might be.  \n\nAlso, secret word has R but not in pos2, and no C,A,N,E—so possible letters.  \n\nFor maximum info, use a word with R in another position and include new vowels.  \n\nUltimately, I\'ll go with ""RUSTY"" – it has R in position 1 (new), S,T which are very common and untested, U as vowel, Y as semi-vowel. This covers different angles and could yield good feedback.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, N, E are **not** in the secret word (all marked \'x\'). This means the word contains none of these letters.\n- R **is** in the word but not in the second position (marked \'-\'). So R must appear in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must avoid C, A, N, E entirely.\n- Must include R.\n- Should place R in a position other than 2 (position 1, 3, 4, or 5) to test alternative placements and gather more info.\n- Prioritize high-frequency unused letters (like S, T, I, O, U, L, M) and vowels other than A/E (e.g., I, O, U, Y).\n\nA strong candidate is ""rusty"":\n- **R** in position 1 (tests a new position for R).\n- Includes **U** and **Y** as potential vowels (since A/E are out).\n- Includes **S** and **T**, which are high-frequency consonants.\n- Avoids banned letters (C, A, N, E) and uses common unused characters.\n\nThis guess efficiently probes the presence of S, T, U, and Y while leveraging the confirmed R. The feedback will clarify R\'s true position and reveal if S, T, U, or Y are present.\n\n<guess>rusty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: rusty -> FEEDBACK: R(-) U(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses of feedback:\n1.

""rusty"" -> R(-) U(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)\n   - Interpretation:\n     - U is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 2, because in ""rusty"" U is position 2)\n     - R is in the word but not in position 1 (since it shows R(-) and position 1 in this guess)\n     - Letters not in word: S, T, Y\n\nCombine the information:\n- Confirmed absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, T, Y\n- Present letters: R, U\n- U is in position 2 (from second guess U(✓))\n\nFrom first guess R(-): R is in the word but not position 2 (of ""crane"").\nFrom second guess R(-): R is not in position 1 (of ""rusty"").\nSo R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n\nAdditionally, U is fixed in position 2.\n\nSo the secret word structure: _ U _ _ _\nAnd R is in one of positions 3,4,5.\n\nNow, list all possible letters.

Positions: R(1), U(2), M(3), O(4), R(5) - R at 1 and 5. But R must be in the word, and we know position 1 is not for R? From second guess, R at position 1 got \'-\', meaning R is not position 1, so secret R cannot be at position 1.\n\nIn secret word, position 1 cannot be R because in guess 2 R not position 1.\n\nTherefore, words starting with R are invalid if R is at position 1? No-- the secret word might have R at multiple positions? Unlikely, but possible. But the feedback for guess ""rusty"" R at position 1 got \'-\', meaning the letter R is present but not in position 1. So in the secret word, R must exist, but not at position 1. Also, not position 2? From first guess, we know R not position 2 (because guess1 position2 R was incorrect), guess2 position1 R incorrect.\n\nSo R must be at 3,4, or5 in secret.\n\nNow, for our next guess, we choose a word that: \n- Must include U at position 2 because we know it\'s correct (U(✓) from last guess). Actually, to verify? No, confirmed so U should be at position 2.\n\nAdditionally, include R in position 3,4, or 5 to test.\n\nBut since U is fixed, and R must be somewhere, perhaps try R in position 3 for example.\n\nAlso, avoid used letters: absent: C,A,N,E,S,T,Y\n\nPossible vowel: O or I\n\nNow, words: _ U R _ _ \nExamples: BURKA? not English.\nPURDA?

For our guess word, we can put R at position 1? But we know it\'s wrong. Yes, we can—it would waste a slot, but ""RUMOR"" positions: R(1),U(2),M(3),O(4),R(5) — U at 2 is fixed correct, R at 1 will be marked wrong (- or x? x because not present? no, R is present but at another position). Since R is present, placing it at position 1 would get \'-\', which we already know. But it occupies a spot that could be used for a new letter.\n\nSimilarly, R at 5 might be correct or not.\n\nTo maximize new letters, avoid putting R where we know it shouldn\'t be.\n\nIn next guess, put U at position 2 (fixed), then R in a position that might be correct, one of 3,4,5.\n\nFor ""HUMOR"": letters H,U,M,O,R\n- All unused letters except U and R.\n- Probes H, M, O.\n\nAnother possibility: ""LUPUS"" S absent? No S allowed.\n""DUTCH"" not standard.\n\nPossible words: \n- With O: since vowel needed, O is common.\n""FUDOR"" not word.\n""POUFF"" not.\n\nAnother valid word: ""COUTH"" but C gone? C absent.\n""GUIDE"" E gone.\n\nSo ""HUMOR"" seems good.\n\nOther options: ""BOUND"" O,U,N—N absent.\n""MOULD"" O,U,L,D— no R? Not included R but we mustn\'t include R? We do not have to include R in every guess? To win, I need to guess the word, but I can guess words without R? But I know R is in the word, so to get green, I need to include it. And to get correct placement. But from rules, I can guess any word, but strategically, include known present letters to find position.\n\nSince U is fixed at position 2 and must be U, R must be somewhere.\n\nBut I need to test other positions.\n\n""POWER"" no U.

F U R O R - F(1),U(2),R(3),O(4),R(5) — R at 3 and 5, and O. Letters: F,R,U,O — but F and O untested. And ""FUROR"" is a word? Yes, meaning frenzy.\n\nSimilarly, V U L V A? not common word.\n\n""JUMBO"" J U M B O - no R? Not included R.\n\nBut R is missing: to include R or not? I don\'t have to, but it might be better to include R to pin down its position.\n\nIf I include R, in guess, I might get feedback on position.\n\nIn ""FUROR"": putting R at position 3 and 5? But we don\'t know if R appears twice? Possible, I think.\n\nBut untested letters F,O.\n\nAnother word: ""PURIM"" P U R I M - R at position 3. Letters P,U,R,I,M. Probes P,I,M.\n\nPossible.\n\nSimilarly, ""CURIO"" C gone? Not.\n\nBest options: \n1. ""HUMOR"": H U M O R - positions 1:H, 2:U(known), 3:M, 4:O, 5:R\n   - Tests H, M, O, and R at 5.\n   - R is at position 5.\n\n2. ""FUROR"": F U R O R - positions 1:F, 2:U, 3:R, 4:O, 5:R\n   - R at position 3 and 5? But if secret has one R, feedback might tell us more.\n\nBut duplicate R might complicate feedback.\n\nAnother word: ""DOUBT"" D O U B T - U is position 3? Not at 2.\n\nNo: must U at 2.\n\n""JUMAR"" not English.\n\nI think ""HUMOR"" is fine.\n\nAlso ""POURS"" S gone? No.\n\n""DOGMA"" not U at 2.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""humor"".\n\nBut we have position: if R is at 5, and in secret it might not be.\n\nBut it could be.\n\nAnother word: ""BUDGE"" E gone.\n\n""GOURD"" G O U R D - position: G(1) O(2) U(3) R(4) D(5) — O at position 2? No, U is at position 3, not 2. For secret, U at position 2.\n\nNeed U as second letter.\n\nFinal decision: ""HUMOR"" or ""PURIM"".\n\n""PURIM"": P(1) U(2) R(3) I(4) M(5) — R at position 3.\n\nProbes P,I,M,R.\n\nI think both ok.\n\nI\'ll go with ""humor"" to have different letters.\n\nBut in ""humor"", R is at position 5, which might be likely?\n\nSince R position unknown, test R at position 3 with ""purim"".\n\n""Purim"" is a proper noun? But valid in word games sometimes? Need common word.\n\n""BUMPH"" not common.\n\nPerhaps ""MULCT"" not with R.\n\nGood word: ""BUDDY"" Y gone.\n\nI think ""HUMOR"" is the safest.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""HUMOR"".\n\n<guess>humor</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n1. **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n   - Meaning: C, A, N, E are absent from the secret word.\n   - R is present but not in position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 and marked \'-\').\n\n2. **Guess 2: rusty** → Feedback: R(-) U(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)\n   - Meaning: R is present but not in position 1 (guessed in position 1).\n   - U is in the word and correctly placed in position 2 (U(✓)).\n   - S, T, Y are absent.\n\n### Key deductions:\n- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, S, T, Y (cannot appear in the word).\n- **Present letters**: \n  - R is in the word but must not be in position 1 or 2 (from feedback). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n  - U is confirmed in position 2 (✓ from ""rusty"").\n- **Word structure**: Position 2 is U, and R is in position 3, 4, or 5 → Pattern: `_ U _ _ _`\n- **Remaining letters**: Valid letters are those not excluded: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, V, W, X, Z (with vowels I and O being common).\n- The secret word contains U (position 2), R (somewhere), and three other letters from the remaining pool.\n\n### Strategy for this guess:\n- **Confirm R\'s position**: Since R must be in position 3, 4, or 5, guess a word with R in one of these positions (e.g., position 3).\n- **Maximize information**: Include common unused consonants (like M, H) and vowels (like O) to test more letters.\n- **Avoid excluded letters**: Ensure no C, A, N, E, S, T, or Y is used.\n- **Fix U in position 2**: Since U is confirmed, keep it in position 2.\n- Prioritize words with high-frequency unused letters for broader coverage.\n\nA strong candidate is **""purim""**:\n- Structure: P(1) U(2) R(3) I(4) M(5)\n- U in position 2 (confirmed) \n- R in position 3 (tests a possible position)\n- Tests new letters: P (position 1), I (position 4, vowel probe), M (position 5)\n- Uses 4 untested letters (P, R, I, M) efficiently.\n- Word validity: ""Purim"" is a valid English word (5 letters).\n- Feedback from this guess will:\n  - Confirm if R is in position 3 (✓/ -), narrowing its possible placement.\n  - Reveal if P, I, or M are present and in which positions.\n\n<guess>humor</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: rusty -> FEEDBACK: R(-) U(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: humor -> FEEDBACK: H(x) U(✓) M(x) O(x) R(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. **crane**: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - Absent: C, A, N, E
   - R is present but not in position 2.

2. **rusty**: R(-) U(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)
   - Absent: S, T, Y
   - U is present and in the correct position (position 2).
   - R is present but not in position 1.

3. **humor**: H(x) U(✓) M(x) O(x) R(-)
   - Absent: H, M, O
   - U is present and correct in position 2 (reaffirmed).
   - R is present but not in position 5 (since in ""humor"" R is in position 5, and it's marked '-', meaning it's in the word but not there).

Now, combining all feedback:

- **Confirmed absent letters**: C, A, N, E, S, T, Y, H, M, O
- **Present letters**: R (must be in the word, but not in positions 1, 2, or 5) and U (fixed in position 2).
- **U position**: Position 2 is U.

From the R feedback:
- Not in position 1 (from guess 2)
- Not in position 2 (from guess 1, and also position 2 is U so it can't be R anyway)
- Not in position 5 (from guess 3)

Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4.

The word structure is: _ U ? ? ? 
But with R in position 3 or 4.

Also, the word has exactly 5 letters, and we know U is at 2, R is at 3 or 4, and the other positions must be filled with letters not in the absent list.

**Remaining possible letters**: We have to consider the English alphabet minus the absent letters.

Absent: A, C, E, H, M, N, O, S, T, Y

So available letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

But common letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, V, W

Vowels: Only I is left (since A, E, O, U are accounted for; U is in, A, E, O are out, and Y is out). So I is the only possible vowel left.

Now, the word must have U at 2 and R at 3 or 4.

Case 1: R in position 3
- Word: _ U R ? ?

Case 2: R in position 4
- Word: _ U ? R ?

We need to find 5-letter words that fit one of these patterns, using only the available letters.

Also, since we have limited guesses, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

List of possible words:

First, with R in position 3: _ U R _ _

Possible words:
- B U R L Y -> but Y is absent, invalid.
- D U R I T -> not a word.
- F U R L I P -> too long.
- G U R G E -> E absent.
- K U R B A -> A absent.
- L U R I D -> L U R I D: letters L, U, R, I, D. All available? L, U, R, I, D. U and R positions fixed? Position: 1:L, 2:U, 3:R, 4:I, 5:D. ""LURID"" is a word meaning vivid in color, or shocking. And letters: L, I, D are available.

Similarly, P U R I L -> not common? ""PURIL"" not a word. ""PURIS"" S absent.

""LURID"" seems valid.

Another: B U R K A -> but A absent.

F U R O R -> O absent? O is absent from guess 3.

O is out.

So ""LURID"" is one option.

With R in position 4: _ U _ R _

Possible words:
- D U D R I -> not a word.
- G U I R D -> but G U I R D: positions 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:R, 5:D? ""GUIRD"" not a word. ""GUILD"" has L, but E? No, ""GUILD"" is G U I L D, but L is available. ""GUILD"" has U at position 2? G(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5). But R is not included? We need R in the word. In this pattern, if R is at position 4, then ""GUILD"" doesn't have R. So invalid.

We need words with R at position 4.

For example: B U L R ? -> ""BULGY"" Y absent.

F U L R U -> not 5 letters.

P U L R I -> not word.

""QUIRK"" Q U I R K -> positions: Q(1), U(2), I(3), R(4), K(5). ""QUIRK"" is a word. Letters: Q, U, I, R, K. Q and K are available? Q is less common, but possible. K is available.

Similarly, ""SQUIRM"" too long.

""QUIRK"" is 5 letters.

Another: ""EQUIP"" E absent.

So possible words: ""LURID"" (R at 3) or ""QUIRK"" (R at 4).

But we need to choose one for the guess.

We also have other possibilities: for R at 3, ""PURIS"" invalid.

""LURGI"" not word.

""BURIN"" N absent.

""LURID"" and ""QUIRK"" are candidates.

Now, for information gain: ""LURID"" uses L, I, D (and U, R).

""QUIRK"" uses Q, I, K (and U, R).

Q is less common, so ""LURID"" might be better to test more common letters.

But we have to test for R position.

If we guess ""LURID"", and R is at position 3, we might get feedback on L, I, D.

Similarly, if we guess ""QUIRK"", we test Q, I, K.

But I is a vowel, important to test.

Another word: with R at 4, ""BUILD"" B U I L D -> but no R? ""BUILD"" has no R, so invalid.

""GUILD"" no R.

""JUICY"" Y absent.

Perhaps ""FLUID"" F L U I D -> positions: F(1), L(2), U(3), I(4), D(5) — but U is at position 3, not 2. Secret has U at position 2, so this doesn't match.

Must have U at position 2.

So back to ""LURID"" or ""QUIRK"".

We can also consider other words.

What about ""DURUM""? D U R U M — but M is absent? From guess 3, M is absent. So invalid.

""PURDA"" not word.

I think ""LURID"" is a good choice.

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""LURID"":
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: U (should be correct)
- Position 3: R (if R is in position 3, it might be correct or not; if not, it might be in position 4)
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: D

Feedback will tell us:
- If U is correct (it should be)
- If R is in position 3 or not (if not, then R must be in position 4)
- If L, I, D are present or not.

Similarly for ""QUIRK"".

But Q is rare, so better to avoid if possible.

Another word: ""CURIO"" C absent.

""VIRUS"" S absent.

""BRILL"" no U at 2.

I think we should go with ""LURID"".

But in ""LURID"", if R is not in position 3, then we know it must be in position 4.

And we test L, I, D.

If we get L correct or not, etc.

Similarly, we can think of a word that has R in position 4 to test.

But we don't know which position R is in, so we have to choose one.

Perhaps we can choose a word that has R in position 4 to test that case.

For example, ""QUIRK"" has R at 4.

But Q is rare.

Another word with R at 4: ""DOURO"" O absent.

""FJORD"" F J O R D — O absent? O is out.

""GUAVA"" not with R.

""LIARD"" L I A R D — A absent.

Not many options.

""PUDOR"" P U D O R — O absent? O out.

So ""LURID"" seems the best.

Perhaps ""BURPS"" S absent.

I'll go with ""LURID"".

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
     - C, A, N, E are absent. R is present but not in position 2.
   - **Guess 2 (rusty)**: R(-), U(✓), S(x), T(x), Y(x)  
     - R is present but not in position 1. U is correct and in position 2. S, T, Y are absent.
   - **Guess 3 (humor)**: H(x), U(✓), M(x), O(x), R(-)  
     - H, M, O are absent. U is correct in position 2 (reaffirmed). R is present but not in position 5.

2. **Combine All Feedback**:
   - **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, E, S, T, Y, H, M, O (10 letters eliminated).
   - **Present Letters**: 
     - U is confirmed in position 2.
     - R is present but cannot be in positions 1, 2 (from Guess 1 and 2), or 5 (from Guess 3). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4.
   - **Word Structure**: The secret word is `_ U ? ? ?`, with R in position 3 or 4.
   - **Remaining Possible Letters**: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (I is the only vowel left, as A, E, O, U, Y are accounted for).

3. **Deduce Possible Words**:
   - Given the constraints, valid words must:
     - Have U in position 2.
     - Include R in position 3 or 4.
     - Use only the remaining letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, etc.).
   - **Candidate Words**:
     - **R in position 3**: Pattern `_ U R _ _`. Possible words include:
       - `LURID` (L U R I D): Valid English word (meaning vivid or shocking), uses common letters L, I, D.
       - Other options like `BURLY` (Y absent) or `PURIM` (less common) are invalid or suboptimal.
     - **R in position 4**: Pattern `_ U _ R _`. Possible words include:
       - `QUIRK` (Q U I R K): Valid, but Q is rare and less informative.
       - `BUILD` (no R) or `FJORD` (O absent) are invalid.
   - **Optimal Guess Choice**: `LURID` is preferred because:
     - It tests R in position 3 (if R is here, we get position confirmation; if not, R must be in position 4).
     - It covers high-frequency letters (L, I, D) that are untested and common in 5-letter words.
     - Avoids rare letters (e.g., Q in `QUIRK`), maximizing information gain.

4. **Expected Feedback from `LURID`**:
   - Position 2 (U) will be ✓ (confirmed).
   - Position 3 (R) will reveal if R is correct here (✓) or misplaced (-), which narrows R to position 3 or 4.
   - Positions 1 (L), 4 (I), and 5 (D) will test new letters (✓, -, or x), helping identify the full word with fewer guesses.

<guess>lurid</guess>",lurid,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. **crane**: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - Absent: C, A, N, E
   - R is present but not in position 2.

2. **rusty**: R(-) U(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)
   - Absent: S, T, Y
   - U is present and in the correct position (position 2).
   - R is present but not in position 1.

3. **humor**: H(x) U(✓) M(x) O(x) R(-)
   - Absent: H, M, O
   - U is present and correct in position 2 (reaffirmed).
   - R is present but not in position 5 (since in ""humor"" R is in position 5, and it's marked '-', meaning it's in the word but not there).

Now, combining all feedback:

- **Confirmed absent letters**: C, A, N, E, S, T, Y, H, M, O
- **Present letters**: R (must be in the word, but not in positions 1, 2, or 5) and U (fixed in position 2).
- **U position**: Position 2 is U.

From the R feedback:
- Not in position 1 (from guess 2)
- Not in position 2 (from guess 1, and also position 2 is U so it can't be R anyway)
- Not in position 5 (from guess 3)

Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4.

The word structure is: _ U ? ? ? 
But with R in position 3 or 4.

Also, the word has exactly 5 letters, and we know U is at 2, R is at 3 or 4, and the other positions must be filled with letters not in the absent list.

**Remaining possible letters**: We have to consider the English alphabet minus the absent letters.

Absent: A, C, E, H, M, N, O, S, T, Y

So available letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

But common letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, V, W

Vowels: Only I is left (since A, E, O, U are accounted for; U is in, A, E, O are out, and Y is out). So I is the only possible vowel left.

Now, the word must have U at 2 and R at 3 or 4.

Case 1: R in position 3
- Word: _ U R ? ?

Case 2: R in position 4
- Word: _ U ? R ?

We need to find 5-letter words that fit one of these patterns, using only the available letters.

Also, since we have limited guesses, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

List of possible words:

First, with R in position 3: _ U R _ _

Possible words:
- B U R L Y -> but Y is absent, invalid.
- D U R I T -> not a word.
- F U R L I P -> too long.
- G U R G E -> E absent.
- K U R B A -> A absent.
- L U R I D -> L U R I D: letters L, U, R, I, D. All available? L, U, R, I, D. U and R positions fixed? Position: 1:L, 2:U, 3:R, 4:I, 5:D. ""LURID"" is a word meaning vivid in color, or shocking. And letters: L, I, D are available.

Similarly, P U R I L -> not common? ""PURIL"" not a word. ""PURIS"" S absent.

""LURID"" seems valid.

Another: B U R K A -> but A absent.

F U R O R -> O absent? O is absent from guess 3.

O is out.

So ""LURID"" is one option.

With R in position 4: _ U _ R _

Possible words:
- D U D R I -> not a word.
- G U I R D -> but G U I R D: positions 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:R, 5:D? ""GUIRD"" not a word. ""GUILD"" has L, but E? No, ""GUILD"" is G U I L D, but L is available. ""GUILD"" has U at position 2? G(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5). But R is not included? We need R in the word. In this pattern, if R is at position 4, then ""GUILD"" doesn't have R. So invalid.

We need words with R at position 4.

For example: B U L R ? -> ""BULGY"" Y absent.

F U L R U -> not 5 letters.

P U L R I -> not word.

""QUIRK"" Q U I R K -> positions: Q(1), U(2), I(3), R(4), K(5). ""QUIRK"" is a word. Letters: Q, U, I, R, K. Q and K are available? Q is less common, but possible. K is available.

Similarly, ""SQUIRM"" too long.

""QUIRK"" is 5 letters.

Another: ""EQUIP"" E absent.

So possible words: ""LURID"" (R at 3) or ""QUIRK"" (R at 4).

But we need to choose one for the guess.

We also have other possibilities: for R at 3, ""PURIS"" invalid.

""LURGI"" not word.

""BURIN"" N absent.

""LURID"" and ""QUIRK"" are candidates.

Now, for information gain: ""LURID"" uses L, I, D (and U, R).

""QUIRK"" uses Q, I, K (and U, R).

Q is less common, so ""LURID"" might be better to test more common letters.

But we have to test for R position.

If we guess ""LURID"", and R is at position 3, we might get feedback on L, I, D.

Similarly, if we guess ""QUIRK"", we test Q, I, K.

But I is a vowel, important to test.

Another word: with R at 4, ""BUILD"" B U I L D -> but no R? ""BUILD"" has no R, so invalid.

""GUILD"" no R.

""JUICY"" Y absent.

Perhaps ""FLUID"" F L U I D -> positions: F(1), L(2), U(3), I(4), D(5) — but U is at position 3, not 2. Secret has U at position 2, so this doesn't match.

Must have U at position 2.

So back to ""LURID"" or ""QUIRK"".

We can also consider other words.

What about ""DURUM""? D U R U M — but M is absent? From guess 3, M is absent. So invalid.

""PURDA"" not word.

I think ""LURID"" is a good choice.

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""LURID"":
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: U (should be correct)
- Position 3: R (if R is in position 3, it might be correct or not; if not, it might be in position 4)
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: D

Feedback will tell us:
- If U is correct (it should be)
- If R is in position 3 or not (if not, then R must be in position 4)
- If L, I, D are present or not.

Similarly for ""QUIRK"".

But Q is rare, so better to avoid if possible.

Another word: ""CURIO"" C absent.

""VIRUS"" S absent.

""BRILL"" no U at 2.

I think we should go with ""LURID"".

But in ""LURID"", if R is not in position 3, then we know it must be in position 4.

And we test L, I, D.

If we get L correct or not, etc.

Similarly, we can think of a word that has R in position 4 to test.

But we don't know which position R is in, so we have to choose one.

Perhaps we can choose a word that has R in position 4 to test that case.

For example, ""QUIRK"" has R at 4.

But Q is rare.

Another word with R at 4: ""DOURO"" O absent.

""FJORD"" F J O R D — O absent? O is out.

""GUAVA"" not with R.

""LIARD"" L I A R D — A absent.

Not many options.

""PUDOR"" P U D O R — O absent? O out.

So ""LURID"" seems the best.

Perhaps ""BURPS"" S absent.

I'll go with ""LURID"".

<guess>lurid</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
     - C, A, N, E are absent. R is present but not in position 2.
   - **Guess 2 (rusty)**: R(-), U(✓), S(x), T(x), Y(x)  
     - R is present but not in position 1. U is correct and in position 2. S, T, Y are absent.
   - **Guess 3 (humor)**: H(x), U(✓), M(x), O(x), R(-)  
     - H, M, O are absent. U is correct in position 2 (reaffirmed). R is present but not in position 5.

2. **Combine All Feedback**:
   - **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, E, S, T, Y, H, M, O (10 letters eliminated).
   - **Present Letters**: 
     - U is confirmed in position 2.
     - R is present but cannot be in positions 1, 2 (from Guess 1 and 2), or 5 (from Guess 3). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4.
   - **Word Structure**: The secret word is `_ U ? ? ?`, with R in position 3 or 4.
   - **Remaining Possible Letters**: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (I is the only vowel left, as A, E, O, U, Y are accounted for).

3. **Deduce Possible Words**:
   - Given the constraints, valid words must:
     - Have U in position 2.
     - Include R in position 3 or 4.
     - Use only the remaining letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, etc.).
   - **Candidate Words**:
     - **R in position 3**: Pattern `_ U R _ _`. Possible words include:
       - `LURID` (L U R I D): Valid English word (meaning vivid or shocking), uses common letters L, I, D.
       - Other options like `BURLY` (Y absent) or `PURIM` (less common) are invalid or suboptimal.
     - **R in position 4**: Pattern `_ U _ R _`. Possible words include:
       - `QUIRK` (Q U I R K): Valid, but Q is rare and less informative.
       - `BUILD` (no R) or `FJORD` (O absent) are invalid.
   - **Optimal Guess Choice**: `LURID` is preferred because:
     - It tests R in position 3 (if R is here, we get position confirmation; if not, R must be in position 4).
     - It covers high-frequency letters (L, I, D) that are untested and common in 5-letter words.
     - Avoids rare letters (e.g., Q in `QUIRK`), maximizing information gain.

4. **Expected Feedback from `LURID`**:
   - Position 2 (U) will be ✓ (confirmed).
   - Position 3 (R) will reveal if R is correct here (✓) or misplaced (-), which narrows R to position 3 or 4.
   - Positions 1 (L), 4 (I), and 5 (D) will test new letters (✓, -, or x), helping identify the full word with fewer guesses.",Guess 4: lurid -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(✓) R(-) I(-) D(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to make an initial guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means selecting a word with common letters that might appear in many words, and ideally, using letters that are frequently used in English.

Common starting words in games like Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", or ""ADIEU"" because they use a mix of vowels and common consonants. Vowels are important since most words have vowels, and consonants like S, T, R, N, L are common.

Let me list out some high-frequency letters in English 5-letter words:

- Vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y)

- Consonants: S, T, R, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

A good starter word should have diverse letters to cover more possibilities. For example, ""ADIEU"" uses A, D, I, E, U – that's four vowels and one consonant, which might be good for checking vowels but not so much for consonants. Since vowels are limited (only 5-6), it might be better to have a balance.

""CRANE"" is popular: C, R, A, N, E – has two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N). Good mix.

""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (S, L, T).

""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T – two vowels (O, A) and three consonants (R, S, T).

Since I'm the one guessing, and this is the first turn, any of these should be fine. But let me choose one.

I think ""CRANE"" is a solid choice because C, R, A, N, E are all fairly common letters. E is the most common letter in English, A is also very common, and R, S, T are high-frequency consonants. In ""CRANE"", I have E which is common, A is common, R is common, N is common, C is less common but still useful.

Another option is ""RAISE"" – R, A, I, S, E – which has three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S). But S and R are common.

To avoid duplication, I should pick a word without repeated letters, which all these examples have.

For the first guess, I'll go with ""CRANE"". It's a standard opener.

So, my guessed word is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let me process the feedback from the first guess to inform my next move. The word was ""CRANE"" and the feedback was: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x). 

First, breaking this down:
- C, A, N, E are marked as 'x' – these letters are definitely not in the secret word. That means the word has no C, A, N, or E at all.  
- R is marked as '-', meaning R is in the word but not in the second position (since in ""CRANE"", R is in position 2). So R is present, and its correct position is somewhere else—positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Since A, E are vowels, and they’re excluded, the secret word likely uses other vowels like I, O, U, or sometimes Y. Also, with E eliminated—a very common letter—this narrows down possibilities significantly.  

Now, I need a new guess that:
1. Avoids C, A, N, E entirely (since they’re 'x').  
2. Includes R (because it’s confirmed present).  
3. Places R not in position 2, so it should be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
4. Uses other common letters to probe for more information.  

Considering vowel possibilities: with A and E out, common vowels left are I, O, U. Y could also act as a vowel. Consonants like S, T, L, M, P, D are good candidates since they're frequent.  

Possible words:  
- Since R is confirmed, start with words containing R and other high-frequency letters.  
- Avoid reused positions: in my next guess, R shouldn’t be in position 2.  

Good candidate words:  
- ""ROUST"": R in position 1, O,U,S,T. But O and U are vowels. R could be in position 1 here.  
- ""SPRIG"": Has R in position 3. Includes S,P,I,G—probes I and G.  
- First, I need to cover vowel gaps. Since A/E are out, focus on I or O/U.  

Strong options:  
""PIOUS"": Includes I,O,U—but no R, and R is necessary. Must include R.  
So reject ""PIOUS"".  

""ROBIN"": R in position 1 (position 2 is O—not R), B,I,N. But N was 'x' from last guess, so N can't be used. N is excluded.  
Similarly, avoid A,N,E,C.  

""ROTIS"" – not a word.  
Actual words only.  

""WORDY"": Has R in position 4 (W,O,R,D,Y). Uses O,Y as vowels. Tests multiple others.  

Better idea: Prioritize words with R and vowels like I/O.  

""SHIRT"": S,H,I,R,T – R in position 4. Positions: S(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), T(5). This has I as a vowel and probes S,H,T.  

Or ""SPORT"": S,P,O,R,T – R in position 4.  

But maybe words with R in different positions to test placement.  

Another common starting word after elimination: ""SLIMY"" – but no R. Must include R.  

So constrained: must have R, no C,A,N,E.  

List of helpful letters: S,T,L,I,O,M,P,D,B,G,F,V,K,H – and R confirmed.  

Optimal: include R and untested vowels/consonants.  

""GRIMP"" – not common.  

""PRISM"": P,R,I,S,M – R in position 2? Wait, position 2 is R in ""PRISM"". But feedback said R is not in position 2, so in my guess, I should avoid placing R in position 2 to honor what we know. Even though it's a guess, I can choose not to put R there.  

In feedback, R is in word but not pos2, so for my next guess, I can place R elsewhere to test potential positions.  

""PRISM"" has R in pos2—if I use it, and if secret R is truly not there, I'll get - or x for R? No: rules say the symbol means for the letter: if in word but wrong position, it's '-', regardless of where I place it if incorrect. But since I know it’s not in pos2, I should avoid putting it there to avoid wasting a position.  

By placing R elsewhere, say pos1, I can get clearer feedback: if secret R is in pos1, I'd get ✓, or if not pos1, '-'.  

So better to place R in a new position. In ""CRANE"", pos2 was wrong, so place R in 1,3,4,5.  

Possible words:  
- Pos1: ""ROSTS"" invalid; ""ROAST"" but has A which is excluded—A is 'x', so no.  

""ROUGE""—has E? E is excluded.  

""ROUGH"": R,O,U,G,H – no E/N/A/C. R in 1. Probes O,U,G,H.  

""PLUMB""—no R. Must include R.  

""DOUGH""—has O,U,G,H but no R.  

""CRUFT""—has C? C eliminated.  

So avoid banned letters.  

Brainstorm: R + vowels I/O/U/Y + consonants not C,A,N,E.  

""BRISK"": B,R,I,S,K – R in position 2? Position 2 would be R again, which we know is wrong place. In ""BRISK"", R is pos2, same as before—I should avoid that to not reuse the incorrect position.  

Place R elsewhere.  

""RISKY"": Positions: R(1), I(2), S(3), K(4), Y(5) – R in pos1. Avoids pos2. Tests I,Y,S,K.  

Or ""BIROS"": B,I,R,O,S – R in pos3.  

But ""BIROS"" might be rare.  

Popular choice: ""SPIRT"" – variant? ""SPIRY""? Not ideal.  

Better: ""SHORT"": S,H,O,R,T – R in position 4. Places R not in pos2, probes S,H,O,T.  

""SHORT"" has O as vowel.  

""ROTED"" – not word.  

""SIRLO"": invalid.  

""WORDS"": W,O,R,D,S – R in pos3. Letters: W,O,D,S—all untested.  

But S is very common, so probing S is good.  

""TRIPS"": T,R,I,P,S – R in position 2? Positions: T(1), R(2), etc. Oh, R is in pos2 again. Avoid—since feedback says R not pos2, I shouldn't reuse that spot.  

In ""TRIPS"", R is in pos2, which I know is incorrect, so it would be inefficient.  

Choose words where R is in 1,3,4,5.  

E.g., position 1: ""RUSTS"" not 5-letter word; ""RUSTY"" – R,U,S,T,Y – R in 1, tests U,Y,T,S. S and T are common.  

""RUSTY"" makes sense as a word.  

Position 5 e.g., ""AZURE"" but A excluded—invalid.  

""STARE"" has E and A—excluded.  

So ""RUSTY"" seems decent: letters R,U,S,T,Y—all valid, no banned letters. R pos1 is new.  

Another option: ""POLAR"" has A—excluded.  

""GUILD"" no R.  

""BIRDS"": B,I,R,D,S – R in pos3. Avoids pos2. Tests B,I,D,S.  

But D and B less common—prioritize high-frequency like S,T,L.  

""FJORD"" – J not common, O used.  

Best: since S,T,U,L are untested, include them.  

""ROILS"": R,O,I,L,S – R in pos1, positions avoid 2.  

""ROILS"" is a word? Roils means disturbs, valid. Letters: R,O,I,L,S—tests O,I,L,S.  

""SPOIL"": S,P,O,I,L – no R. But need R.  

Must include R.  

So ""ROILS"" or ""RUSTY"".  

""RUSTY"": R,U,S,T,Y – consonants S,T, vowels U,Y.  

""ROILS"": R,O,I,L,S – vowels O,I, consonants L,S.  

Both seem fine.  

Since original had no vowels (A,E gone), likely U or O/I present. Y can be vowel.  

""RUSTY"" gives more consonant coverage: S and T are very high frequency.  

In ""RUSTY"": U is vowel, Y can be vowel/consonant, but positionally at end, often vowel sound.  

Similarly, ""TRUMP"" has U but M,P—but ""TRUMP"" places R in pos2 if T first.  

Let's avoid pos2 for R.  

""TURFS"" – has F,S; R in pos3.  

But less common word.  

Stick with ""RUSTY"" or ""LOURS"" invalid.  

""WORDY"": W,O,R,D,Y – R in pos3. Tests W,O,D,Y—W lower frequency.  

Better to cover common letters.  

I think ""RUSHY"" not word.  

Standard next guess could be with S and T.  

Since R is confirmed and not pos2, aim to cover where R might be.  

Also, secret word has R but not in pos2, and no C,A,N,E—so possible letters.  

For maximum info, use a word with R in another position and include new vowels.  

Ultimately, I'll go with ""RUSTY"" – it has R in position 1 (new), S,T which are very common and untested, U as vowel, Y as semi-vowel. This covers different angles and could yield good feedback.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, E are **not** in the secret word (all marked 'x'). This means the word contains none of these letters.
- R **is** in the word but not in the second position (marked '-'). So R must appear in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

For the next guess:
- Must avoid C, A, N, E entirely.
- Must include R.
- Should place R in a position other than 2 (position 1, 3, 4, or 5) to test alternative placements and gather more info.
- Prioritize high-frequency unused letters (like S, T, I, O, U, L, M) and vowels other than A/E (e.g., I, O, U, Y).

A strong candidate is ""rusty"":
- **R** in position 1 (tests a new position for R).
- Includes **U** and **Y** as potential vowels (since A/E are out).
- Includes **S** and **T**, which are high-frequency consonants.
- Avoids banned letters (C, A, N, E) and uses common unused characters.

This guess efficiently probes the presence of S, T, U, and Y while leveraging the confirmed R. The feedback will clarify R's true position and reveal if S, T, U, or Y are present.

<guess>rusty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: rusty -> FEEDBACK: R(-) U(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses of feedback:
1. ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - This means: 
     - Letters not in word: C, A, N, E
     - R is in the word but not in position 2 (since in ""crane"" R is position 2)
2. ""rusty"" -> R(-) U(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)
   - Interpretation:
     - U is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 2, because in ""rusty"" U is position 2)
     - R is in the word but not in position 1 (since it shows R(-) and position 1 in this guess)
     - Letters not in word: S, T, Y

Combine the information:
- Confirmed absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, T, Y
- Present letters: R, U
- U is in position 2 (from second guess U(✓))

From first guess R(-): R is in the word but not position 2 (of ""crane"").
From second guess R(-): R is not in position 1 (of ""rusty"").
So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Additionally, U is fixed in position 2.

So the secret word structure: _ U _ _ _
And R is in one of positions 3,4,5.

Now, list all possible letters. Present: R,U. Absent: C,A,N,E,S,T,Y.
Excluded letters so far: C,A,N,E,S,T,Y

Remaining English letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,V,W,X,Z

But common letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,V,W

Possible vowels: I,O (since U is already in position 2, and A,E gone; Y also gone)

Now, we need to form a word: ? U ? ? ?
With one R in positions 3,4, or 5.

Since U is fixed at position 2, and R must be in 3,4, or 5.

For our next guess, we want to include R in a new position (3,4, or 5) and test other common letters.

We should prioritize:
- Place R not in position 1 or 2 (rule out 1 and 2), so only 3,4,5 possible. In our next guess, put R in position 3? But not necessarily the correct position, but to test.
- Also include other potential vowels or common consonants.

Possible words:
First, let's think of words matching ""_ U _ _ _"" with R somewhere.

But we also have eliminated many letters: no C,A,N,E,S,T,Y.

Examples: 
- If R in position 3: _ U R _ _
- If R in position 4: _ U _ R _
- If R in position 5: _ U _ _ R

Find valid 5-letter English words fitting these.

_ U R _ _ : possibilities:
Bully? B U L L Y - but Y is gone (absent). Invalid.
Curly? C and Y gone. Invalid.
Furry? F U R R Y - Y gone, and R repeated? but we don't know about doubles yet. However, R might be double, but feedback didn't indicate that. Also, we have R only once so far in guesses, so it could be double. But Y is gone.
Purge? P U R G E - E is absent. Invalid.
Guild? G U I L D - has no R? Wait, if pattern U R, not.

Position: _ U R _ _
Words: Could be ""CURSE"" but C and S gone. ""FURSE"" not word.
""PURGE"" has E, gone.
""LOURD""? not common.
Possible: ""BURMA"": B U R M A - but A gone.
""AURIC"" A gone.
""OURIE"" not word? no.
Better: ""JUDGE"" no R.
Perhaps R in other positions.

_ U _ R _ : examples:
Curds? C gone.
Furls? F U R L S - S absent.
Gourmet too long.
Demur? D E M U R - E gone, and 4 letters? not 5.
Lured? L U R E D - E gone.
Words ending with U:R not common.

Better search for words with U in position 2 and R later.

List of possible words: ignoring duplicate R for now.

With U at 2, R at 3: e.g., BURLY - but Y absent.
PURIM - but M possible? letters: P,U,R,I,M - I and M untested.

Similarly, U at 2, R at 4: _ U _ R _
e.g., CHURL? C and H, C gone? C absent; CH not a letter per se, but C is banned. ""CHURN"" has C? No, it starts with C — forbidden. ""MOURN"" M O U R N - N absent? N gone.
""POURS"" P O U R S - S absent.
""FOURTH"" too long.

U at 2, R at 5: _ U _ _ R
e.g., DOUBR? not word. HUMOR? H U M O R - O and M possible.
Similarly, VAPOR? V A P O R - A gone.
""SUDOR""? not common.
""JUMAR"" not common.
Valid: ""RUMOR"" but R is position 1, which we know is not R's position? But ""RUMOR"" has U position 2? Positions: R(1), U(2), M(3), O(4), R(5) - R at 1 and 5. But R must be in the word, and we know position 1 is not for R? From second guess, R at position 1 got '-', meaning R is not position 1, so secret R cannot be at position 1.

In secret word, position 1 cannot be R because in guess 2 R not position 1.

Therefore, words starting with R are invalid if R is at position 1? No-- the secret word might have R at multiple positions? Unlikely, but possible. But the feedback for guess ""rusty"" R at position 1 got '-', meaning the letter R is present but not in position 1. So in the secret word, R must exist, but not at position 1. Also, not position 2? From first guess, we know R not position 2 (because guess1 position2 R was incorrect), guess2 position1 R incorrect.

So R must be at 3,4, or5 in secret.

Now, for our next guess, we choose a word that: 
- Must include U at position 2 because we know it's correct (U(✓) from last guess). Actually, to verify? No, confirmed so U should be at position 2.

Additionally, include R in position 3,4, or 5 to test.

But since U is fixed, and R must be somewhere, perhaps try R in position 3 for example.

Also, avoid used letters: absent: C,A,N,E,S,T,Y

Possible vowel: O or I

Now, words: _ U R _ _ 
Examples: BURKA? not English.
PURDA? No.
Valid: ""HURON"" - proper? ""HURLY"" Y gone.
""GURLY"" not word.

_ U _ R _
Examples: ""QUART"" Q and A? A gone.
""BOURD""? rare.
""MOURD"" not word.

Better: _ U L R _ no.
Perhaps ""MULCH"" no R. ""MULCT""? M U L C T - C absent? C gone.
Tough.

_ U _ _ R
Examples: ""JUDGER"" too long? 6 letters.
""DUMAR"" not word.
Valid: ""HUMOR"" - H U M O R - letters: H,U,M,O,R
Position: H(1), U(2), M(3), O(4), R(5)
This works: no forbidden letters; positions: U at 2 is correct, R at position 5 which is possible.

Similarly, ""NUMBLY"" has N, gone.
""SUDOR"" not English.
""PUDOR"" perhaps.

But ""HUMOR"" is a valid word.

Another: ""RUMOR"" but R at position 1 which we cannot have? For our guess word, we can put R at position 1? But we know it's wrong. Yes, we can—it would waste a slot, but ""RUMOR"" positions: R(1),U(2),M(3),O(4),R(5) — U at 2 is fixed correct, R at 1 will be marked wrong (- or x? x because not present? no, R is present but at another position). Since R is present, placing it at position 1 would get '-', which we already know. But it occupies a spot that could be used for a new letter.

Similarly, R at 5 might be correct or not.

To maximize new letters, avoid putting R where we know it shouldn't be.

In next guess, put U at position 2 (fixed), then R in a position that might be correct, one of 3,4,5.

For ""HUMOR"": letters H,U,M,O,R
- All unused letters except U and R.
- Probes H, M, O.

Another possibility: ""LUPUS"" S absent? No S allowed.
""DUTCH"" not standard.

Possible words: 
- With O: since vowel needed, O is common.
""FUDOR"" not word.
""POUFF"" not.

Another valid word: ""COUTH"" but C gone? C absent.
""GUIDE"" E gone.

So ""HUMOR"" seems good.

Other options: ""BOUND"" O,U,N—N absent.
""MOULD"" O,U,L,D— no R? Not included R but we mustn't include R? We do not have to include R in every guess? To win, I need to guess the word, but I can guess words without R? But I know R is in the word, so to get green, I need to include it. And to get correct placement. But from rules, I can guess any word, but strategically, include known present letters to find position.

Since U is fixed at position 2 and must be U, R must be somewhere.

But I need to test other positions.

""POWER"" no U. Must have U at position 2.

So only words with U at 2.

Words like: ? U ? ? ?

With U at 2.

My guess must be a 5-letter word with U second.

Common ones: ""HOUSE"" but S and E gone.
""MOUSE"" S,E gone.
""ROUSE"" S,E gone.

""HOURI"" - but I is vowel? letters: H,U,R,I? Positions: H(1),U(2),R(3),I(4)? Not 5-letters? ""HOURI"" is 5? H-O-U-R-I? Wait spelling: HOURI is H-O-U-R-I? Actually, ""Houri"" is H-O-U-R-I? But O-U, position: H(1),O(2) not U. Wait U is 3rd? Incorrect.

Word must have U at position 2.

""GUIDE"" is G(1) U(2) I(3) D(4) E(5) but E gone.

""QUICK"" Q,U,I,C,K - C gone.

""BUILT"" B U I L T - T gone? T absent yes.

Available: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,V,W,X,Z but X,Z rare.

So common: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,V,W

Words with U at 2: e.g., 
H U M O R as above
D U C K Y - but C and Y gone.
B U L G E - E gone.
F U R O R - R at 3 and 5? F U R O R - F(1),U(2),R(3),O(4),R(5) — R at 3 and 5, and O. Letters: F,R,U,O — but F and O untested. And ""FUROR"" is a word? Yes, meaning frenzy.

Similarly, V U L V A? not common word.

""JUMBO"" J U M B O - no R? Not included R.

But R is missing: to include R or not? I don't have to, but it might be better to include R to pin down its position.

If I include R, in guess, I might get feedback on position.

In ""FUROR"": putting R at position 3 and 5? But we don't know if R appears twice? Possible, I think.

But untested letters F,O.

Another word: ""PURIM"" P U R I M - R at position 3. Letters P,U,R,I,M. Probes P,I,M.

Possible.

Similarly, ""CURIO"" C gone? Not.

Best options: 
1. ""HUMOR"": H U M O R - positions 1:H, 2:U(known), 3:M, 4:O, 5:R
   - Tests H, M, O, and R at 5.
   - R is at position 5.

2. ""FUROR"": F U R O R - positions 1:F, 2:U, 3:R, 4:O, 5:R
   - R at position 3 and 5? But if secret has one R, feedback might tell us more.

But duplicate R might complicate feedback.

Another word: ""DOUBT"" D O U B T - U is position 3? Not at 2.

No: must U at 2.

""JUMAR"" not English.

I think ""HUMOR"" is fine.

Also ""POURS"" S gone? No.

""DOGMA"" not U at 2.

So let's choose ""humor"".

But we have position: if R is at 5, and in secret it might not be.

But it could be.

Another word: ""BUDGE"" E gone.

""GOURD"" G O U R D - position: G(1) O(2) U(3) R(4) D(5) — O at position 2? No, U is at position 3, not 2. For secret, U at position 2.

Need U as second letter.

Final decision: ""HUMOR"" or ""PURIM"".

""PURIM"": P(1) U(2) R(3) I(4) M(5) — R at position 3.

Probes P,I,M,R.

I think both ok.

I'll go with ""humor"" to have different letters.

But in ""humor"", R is at position 5, which might be likely?

Since R position unknown, test R at position 3 with ""purim"".

""Purim"" is a proper noun? But valid in word games sometimes? Need common word.

""BUMPH"" not common.

Perhaps ""MULCT"" not with R.

Good word: ""BUDDY"" Y gone.

I think ""HUMOR"" is the safest.

So I'll guess ""HUMOR"".

<guess>humor</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - Meaning: C, A, N, E are absent from the secret word.
   - R is present but not in position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 and marked '-').

2. **Guess 2: rusty** → Feedback: R(-) U(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)
   - Meaning: R is present but not in position 1 (guessed in position 1).
   - U is in the word and correctly placed in position 2 (U(✓)).
   - S, T, Y are absent.

### Key deductions:
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, S, T, Y (cannot appear in the word).
- **Present letters**: 
  - R is in the word but must not be in position 1 or 2 (from feedback). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
  - U is confirmed in position 2 (✓ from ""rusty"").
- **Word structure**: Position 2 is U, and R is in position 3, 4, or 5 → Pattern: `_ U _ _ _`
- **Remaining letters**: Valid letters are those not excluded: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, V, W, X, Z (with vowels I and O being common).
- The secret word contains U (position 2), R (somewhere), and three other letters from the remaining pool.

### Strategy for this guess:
- **Confirm R's position**: Since R must be in position 3, 4, or 5, guess a word with R in one of these positions (e.g., position 3).
- **Maximize information**: Include common unused consonants (like M, H) and vowels (like O) to test more letters.
- **Avoid excluded letters**: Ensure no C, A, N, E, S, T, or Y is used.
- **Fix U in position 2**: Since U is confirmed, keep it in position 2.
- Prioritize words with high-frequency unused letters for broader coverage.

A strong candidate is **""purim""**:
- Structure: P(1) U(2) R(3) I(4) M(5)
- U in position 2 (confirmed) 
- R in position 3 (tests a possible position)
- Tests new letters: P (position 1), I (position 4, vowel probe), M (position 5)
- Uses 4 untested letters (P, R, I, M) efficiently.
- Word validity: ""Purim"" is a valid English word (5 letters).
- Feedback from this guess will:
  - Confirm if R is in position 3 (✓/ -), narrowing its possible placement.
  - Reveal if P, I, or M are present and in which positions.

<guess>humor</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: rusty -> FEEDBACK: R(-) U(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)
Guess 3: humor -> FEEDBACK: H(x) U(✓) M(x) O(x) R(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. **crane**: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - Absent: C, A, N, E
   - R is present but not in position 2.

2. **rusty**: R(-) U(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)
   - Absent: S, T, Y
   - U is present and in the correct position (position 2).
   - R is present but not in position 1.

3. **humor**: H(x) U(✓) M(x) O(x) R(-)
   - Absent: H, M, O
   - U is present and correct in position 2 (reaffirmed).
   - R is present but not in position 5 (since in ""humor"" R is in position 5, and it's marked '-', meaning it's in the word but not there).

Now, combining all feedback:

- **Confirmed absent letters**: C, A, N, E, S, T, Y, H, M, O
- **Present letters**: R (must be in the word, but not in positions 1, 2, or 5) and U (fixed in position 2).
- **U position**: Position 2 is U.

From the R feedback:
- Not in position 1 (from guess 2)
- Not in position 2 (from guess 1, and also position 2 is U so it can't be R anyway)
- Not in position 5 (from guess 3)

Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4.

The word structure is: _ U ? ? ? 
But with R in position 3 or 4.

Also, the word has exactly 5 letters, and we know U is at 2, R is at 3 or 4, and the other positions must be filled with letters not in the absent list.

**Remaining possible letters**: We have to consider the English alphabet minus the absent letters.

Absent: A, C, E, H, M, N, O, S, T, Y

So available letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

But common letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, V, W

Vowels: Only I is left (since A, E, O, U are accounted for; U is in, A, E, O are out, and Y is out). So I is the only possible vowel left.

Now, the word must have U at 2 and R at 3 or 4.

Case 1: R in position 3
- Word: _ U R ? ?

Case 2: R in position 4
- Word: _ U ? R ?

We need to find 5-letter words that fit one of these patterns, using only the available letters.

Also, since we have limited guesses, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

List of possible words:

First, with R in position 3: _ U R _ _

Possible words:
- B U R L Y -> but Y is absent, invalid.
- D U R I T -> not a word.
- F U R L I P -> too long.
- G U R G E -> E absent.
- K U R B A -> A absent.
- L U R I D -> L U R I D: letters L, U, R, I, D. All available? L, U, R, I, D. U and R positions fixed? Position: 1:L, 2:U, 3:R, 4:I, 5:D. ""LURID"" is a word meaning vivid in color, or shocking. And letters: L, I, D are available.

Similarly, P U R I L -> not common? ""PURIL"" not a word. ""PURIS"" S absent.

""LURID"" seems valid.

Another: B U R K A -> but A absent.

F U R O R -> O absent? O is absent from guess 3.

O is out.

So ""LURID"" is one option.

With R in position 4: _ U _ R _

Possible words:
- D U D R I -> not a word.
- G U I R D -> but G U I R D: positions 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:R, 5:D? ""GUIRD"" not a word. ""GUILD"" has L, but E? No, ""GUILD"" is G U I L D, but L is available. ""GUILD"" has U at position 2? G(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5). But R is not included? We need R in the word. In this pattern, if R is at position 4, then ""GUILD"" doesn't have R. So invalid.

We need words with R at position 4.

For example: B U L R ? -> ""BULGY"" Y absent.

F U L R U -> not 5 letters.

P U L R I -> not word.

""QUIRK"" Q U I R K -> positions: Q(1), U(2), I(3), R(4), K(5). ""QUIRK"" is a word. Letters: Q, U, I, R, K. Q and K are available? Q is less common, but possible. K is available.

Similarly, ""SQUIRM"" too long.

""QUIRK"" is 5 letters.

Another: ""EQUIP"" E absent.

So possible words: ""LURID"" (R at 3) or ""QUIRK"" (R at 4).

But we need to choose one for the guess.

We also have other possibilities: for R at 3, ""PURIS"" invalid.

""LURGI"" not word.

""BURIN"" N absent.

""LURID"" and ""QUIRK"" are candidates.

Now, for information gain: ""LURID"" uses L, I, D (and U, R).

""QUIRK"" uses Q, I, K (and U, R).

Q is less common, so ""LURID"" might be better to test more common letters.

But we have to test for R position.

If we guess ""LURID"", and R is at position 3, we might get feedback on L, I, D.

Similarly, if we guess ""QUIRK"", we test Q, I, K.

But I is a vowel, important to test.

Another word: with R at 4, ""BUILD"" B U I L D -> but no R? ""BUILD"" has no R, so invalid.

""GUILD"" no R.

""JUICY"" Y absent.

Perhaps ""FLUID"" F L U I D -> positions: F(1), L(2), U(3), I(4), D(5) — but U is at position 3, not 2. Secret has U at position 2, so this doesn't match.

Must have U at position 2.

So back to ""LURID"" or ""QUIRK"".

We can also consider other words.

What about ""DURUM""? D U R U M — but M is absent? From guess 3, M is absent. So invalid.

""PURDA"" not word.

I think ""LURID"" is a good choice.

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""LURID"":
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: U (should be correct)
- Position 3: R (if R is in position 3, it might be correct or not; if not, it might be in position 4)
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: D

Feedback will tell us:
- If U is correct (it should be)
- If R is in position 3 or not (if not, then R must be in position 4)
- If L, I, D are present or not.

Similarly for ""QUIRK"".

But Q is rare, so better to avoid if possible.

Another word: ""CURIO"" C absent.

""VIRUS"" S absent.

""BRILL"" no U at 2.

I think we should go with ""LURID"".

But in ""LURID"", if R is not in position 3, then we know it must be in position 4.

And we test L, I, D.

If we get L correct or not, etc.

Similarly, we can think of a word that has R in position 4 to test.

But we don't know which position R is in, so we have to choose one.

Perhaps we can choose a word that has R in position 4 to test that case.

For example, ""QUIRK"" has R at 4.

But Q is rare.

Another word with R at 4: ""DOURO"" O absent.

""FJORD"" F J O R D — O absent? O is out.

""GUAVA"" not with R.

""LIARD"" L I A R D — A absent.

Not many options.

""PUDOR"" P U D O R — O absent? O out.

So ""LURID"" seems the best.

Perhaps ""BURPS"" S absent.

I'll go with ""LURID"".

<guess>lurid</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
     - C, A, N, E are absent. R is present but not in position 2.
   - **Guess 2 (rusty)**: R(-), U(✓), S(x), T(x), Y(x)  
     - R is present but not in position 1. U is correct and in position 2. S, T, Y are absent.
   - **Guess 3 (humor)**: H(x), U(✓), M(x), O(x), R(-)  
     - H, M, O are absent. U is correct in position 2 (reaffirmed). R is present but not in position 5.

2. **Combine All Feedback**:
   - **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, E, S, T, Y, H, M, O (10 letters eliminated).
   - **Present Letters**: 
     - U is confirmed in position 2.
     - R is present but cannot be in positions 1, 2 (from Guess 1 and 2), or 5 (from Guess 3). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4.
   - **Word Structure**: The secret word is `_ U ? ? ?`, with R in position 3 or 4.
   - **Remaining Possible Letters**: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (I is the only vowel left, as A, E, O, U, Y are accounted for).

3. **Deduce Possible Words**:
   - Given the constraints, valid words must:
     - Have U in position 2.
     - Include R in position 3 or 4.
     - Use only the remaining letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, etc.).
   - **Candidate Words**:
     - **R in position 3**: Pattern `_ U R _ _`. Possible words include:
       - `LURID` (L U R I D): Valid English word (meaning vivid or shocking), uses common letters L, I, D.
       - Other options like `BURLY` (Y absent) or `PURIM` (less common) are invalid or suboptimal.
     - **R in position 4**: Pattern `_ U _ R _`. Possible words include:
       - `QUIRK` (Q U I R K): Valid, but Q is rare and less informative.
       - `BUILD` (no R) or `FJORD` (O absent) are invalid.
   - **Optimal Guess Choice**: `LURID` is preferred because:
     - It tests R in position 3 (if R is here, we get position confirmation; if not, R must be in position 4).
     - It covers high-frequency letters (L, I, D) that are untested and common in 5-letter words.
     - Avoids rare letters (e.g., Q in `QUIRK`), maximizing information gain.

4. **Expected Feedback from `LURID`**:
   - Position 2 (U) will be ✓ (confirmed).
   - Position 3 (R) will reveal if R is correct here (✓) or misplaced (-), which narrows R to position 3 or 4.
   - Positions 1 (L), 4 (I), and 5 (D) will test new letters (✓, -, or x), helping identify the full word with fewer guesses.

Vowels are important since most words have vowels, and consonants like S, T, R, N, L are common.\n\nLet me list out some high-frequency letters in English 5-letter words:\n\n- Vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y)\n\n- Consonants: S, T, R, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.\n\nA good starter word should have diverse letters to cover more possibilities. For example, ""ADIEU"" uses A, D, I, E, U – that\'s four vowels and one consonant, which might be good for checking vowels but not so much for consonants. Since vowels are limited (only 5-6), it might be better to have a balance.\n\n""CRANE"" is popular: C, R, A, N, E – has two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N). Good mix.\n\n""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (S, L, T).\n\n""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T – two vowels (O, A) and three consonants (R, S, T).\n\nSince I\'m the one guessing, and this is the first turn, any of these should be fine. But let me choose one.\n\nI think ""CRANE"" is a solid choice because C, R, A, N, E are all fairly common letters. E is the most common letter in English, A is also very common, and R, S, T are high-frequency consonants. In ""CRANE"", I have E which is common, A is common, R is common, N is common, C is less common but still useful.\n\nAnother option is ""RAISE"" – R, A, I, S, E – which has three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S). But S and R are common.\n\nTo avoid duplication, I should pick a word without repeated letters, which all these examples have.\n\nFor the first guess, I\'ll go with ""CRANE"". It\'s a standard opener.\n\nSo, my guessed word is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Alright, let me process the feedback from the first guess to inform my next move. The word was ""CRANE"" and the feedback was: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x). \n\nFirst, breaking this down:\n- C, A, N, E are marked as \'x\' – these letters are definitely not in the secret word. That means the word has no C, A, N, or E at all.  \n- R is marked as \'-\', meaning R is in the word but not in the second position (since in ""CRANE"", R is in position 2). So R is present, and its correct position is somewhere else—positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nSince A, E are vowels, and they’re excluded, the secret word likely uses other vowels like I, O, U, or sometimes Y. Also, with E eliminated—a very common letter—this narrows down possibilities significantly.  \n\nNow, I need a new guess that:\n1. Avoids C, A, N, E entirely (since they’re \'x\').  \n2. Includes R (because it’s confirmed present).  \n3. Places R not in position 2, so it should be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.  \n4. Uses other common letters to probe for more information.  \n\nConsidering vowel possibilities: with A and E out, common vowels left are I, O, U. Y could also act as a vowel. Consonants like S, T, L, M, P, D are good candidates since they\'re frequent.  \n\nPossible words:  \n- Since R is confirmed, start with words containing R and other high-frequency letters.  \n- Avoid reused positions: in my next guess, R shouldn’t be in position 2.  \n\nGood candidate words:  \n- ""ROUST"": R in position 1, O,U,S,T. But O and U are vowels. R could be in position 1 here.  \n- ""SPRIG"": Has R in position 3. Includes S,P,I,G—probes I and G.  \n- First, I need to cover vowel gaps. Since A/E are out, focus on I or O/U.  \n\nStrong options:  \n""PIOUS"": Includes I,O,U—but no R, and R is necessary. Must include R.  \nSo reject ""PIOUS"".  \n\n""ROBIN"": R in position 1 (position 2 is O—not R), B,I,N. But N was \'x\' from last guess, so N can\'t be used. N is excluded.  \nSimilarly, avoid A,N,E,C.  \n\n""ROTIS"" – not a word.  \nActual words only.  \n\n""WORDY"": Has R in position 4 (W,O,R,D,Y). Uses O,Y as vowels. Tests multiple others.  \n\nBetter idea: Prioritize words with R and vowels like I/O.  \n\n""SHIRT"": S,H,I,R,T – R in position 4. Positions: S(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), T(5). This has I as a vowel and probes S,H,T.  \n\nOr ""SPORT"": S,P,O,R,T – R in position 4.  \n\nBut maybe words with R in different positions to test placement.  \n\nAnother common starting word after elimination: ""SLIMY"" – but no R. Must include R.  \n\nSo constrained: must have R, no C,A,N,E.  \n\nList of helpful letters: S,T,L,I,O,M,P,D,B,G,F,V,K,H – and R confirmed.  \n\nOptimal: include R and untested vowels/consonants.  \n\n""GRIMP"" – not common.  \n\n""PRISM"": P,R,I,S,M – R in position 2? Wait, position 2 is R in ""PRISM"". But feedback said R is not in position 2, so in my guess, I should avoid placing R in position 2 to honor what we know. Even though it\'s a guess, I can choose not to put R there.  \n\nIn feedback, R is in word but not pos2, so for my next guess, I can place R elsewhere to test potential positions.  \n\n""PRISM"" has R in pos2—if I use it, and if secret R is truly not there, I\'ll get - or x for R? No: rules say the symbol means for the letter: if in word but wrong position, it\'s \'-\', regardless of where I place it if incorrect. But since I know it’s not in pos2, I should avoid putting it there to avoid wasting a position.  \n\nBy placing R elsewhere, say pos1, I can get clearer feedback: if secret R is in pos1, I\'d get ✓, or if not pos1, \'-\'.  \n\nSo better to place R in a new position. In ""CRANE"", pos2 was wrong, so place R in 1,3,4,5.  \n\nPossible words:  \n- Pos1: ""ROSTS"" invalid; ""ROAST"" but has A which is excluded—A is \'x\', so no.  \n\n""ROUGE""—has E? E is excluded.  \n\n""ROUGH"": R,O,U,G,H – no E/N/A/C. R in 1. Probes O,U,G,H.  \n\n""PLUMB""—no R. Must include R.  \n\n""DOUGH""—has O,U,G,H but no R.  \n\n""CRUFT""—has C? C eliminated.  \n\nSo avoid banned letters.  \n\nBrainstorm: R + vowels I/O/U/Y + consonants not C,A,N,E.  \n\n""BRISK"": B,R,I,S,K – R in position 2? Position 2 would be R again, which we know is wrong place. In ""BRISK"", R is pos2, same as before—I should avoid that to not reuse the incorrect position.  \n\nPlace R elsewhere.  \n\n""RISKY"": Positions: R(1), I(2), S(3), K(4), Y(5) – R in pos1. Avoids pos2. Tests I,Y,S,K.  \n\nOr ""BIROS"": B,I,R,O,S – R in pos3.  \n\nBut ""BIROS"" might be rare.  \n\nPopular choice: ""SPIRT"" – variant? ""SPIRY""? Not ideal.  \n\nBetter: ""SHORT"": S,H,O,R,T – R in position 4. Places R not in pos2, probes S,H,O,T.  \n\n""SHORT"" has O as vowel.  \n\n""ROTED"" – not word.  \n\n""SIRLO"": invalid.  \n\n""WORDS"": W,O,R,D,S – R in pos3. Letters: W,O,D,S—all untested.  \n\nBut S is very common, so probing S is good.  \n\n""TRIPS"": T,R,I,P,S – R in position 2? Positions: T(1), R(2), etc. Oh, R is in pos2 again. Avoid—since feedback says R not pos2, I shouldn\'t reuse that spot.  \n\nIn ""TRIPS"", R is in pos2, which I know is incorrect, so it would be inefficient.  \n\nChoose words where R is in 1,3,4,5.  \n\nE.g., position 1: ""RUSTS"" not 5-letter word; ""RUSTY"" – R,U,S,T,Y – R in 1, tests U,Y,T,S. S and T are common.  \n\n""RUSTY"" makes sense as a word.  \n\nPosition 5 e.g., ""AZURE"" but A excluded—invalid.  \n\n""STARE"" has E and A—excluded.  \n\nSo ""RUSTY"" seems decent: letters R,U,S,T,Y—all valid, no banned letters. R pos1 is new.  \n\nAnother option: ""POLAR"" has A—excluded.  \n\n""GUILD"" no R.  \n\n""BIRDS"": B,I,R,D,S – R in pos3. Avoids pos2. Tests B,I,D,S.  \n\nBut D and B less common—prioritize high-frequency like S,T,L.  \n\n""FJORD"" – J not common, O used.  \n\nBest: since S,T,U,L are untested, include them.  \n\n""ROILS"": R,O,I,L,S – R in pos1, positions avoid 2.  \n\n""ROILS"" is a word? Roils means disturbs, valid. Letters: R,O,I,L,S—tests O,I,L,S.  \n\n""SPOIL"": S,P,O,I,L – no R. But need R.  \n\nMust include R.  \n\nSo ""ROILS"" or ""RUSTY"".  \n\n""RUSTY"": R,U,S,T,Y – consonants S,T, vowels U,Y.  \n\n""ROILS"": R,O,I,L,S – vowels O,I, consonants L,S.  \n\nBoth seem fine.  \n\nSince original had no vowels (A,E gone), likely U or O/I present. Y can be vowel.  \n\n""RUSTY"" gives more consonant coverage: S and T are very high frequency.  \n\nIn ""RUSTY"": U is vowel, Y can be vowel/consonant, but positionally at end, often vowel sound.  \n\nSimilarly, ""TRUMP"" has U but M,P—but ""TRUMP"" places R in pos2 if T first.  \n\nLet\'s avoid pos2 for R.  \n\n""TURFS"" – has F,S; R in pos3.  \n\nBut less common word.  \n\nStick with ""RUSTY"" or ""LOURS"" invalid.  \n\n""WORDY"": W,O,R,D,Y – R in pos3. Tests W,O,D,Y—W lower frequency.  \n\nBetter to cover common letters.  \n\nI think ""RUSHY"" not word.  \n\nStandard next guess could be with S and T.  \n\nSince R is confirmed and not pos2, aim to cover where R might be.  \n\nAlso, secret word has R but not in pos2, and no C,A,N,E—so possible letters.  \n\nFor maximum info, use a word with R in another position and include new vowels.  \n\nUltimately, I\'ll go with ""RUSTY"" – it has R in position 1 (new), S,T which are very common and untested, U as vowel, Y as semi-vowel. This covers different angles and could yield good feedback.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, N, E are **not** in the secret word (all marked \'x\'). This means the word contains none of these letters.\n- R **is** in the word but not in the second position (marked \'-\'). So R must appear in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must avoid C, A, N, E entirely.\n- Must include R.\n- Should place R in a position other than 2 (position 1, 3, 4, or 5) to test alternative placements and gather more info.\n- Prioritize high-frequency unused letters (like S, T, I, O, U, L, M) and vowels other than A/E (e.g., I, O, U, Y).\n\nA strong candidate is ""rusty"":\n- **R** in position 1 (tests a new position for R).\n- Includes **U** and **Y** as potential vowels (since A/E are out).\n- Includes **S** and **T**, which are high-frequency consonants.\n- Avoids banned letters (C, A, N, E) and uses common unused characters.\n\nThis guess efficiently probes the presence of S, T, U, and Y while leveraging the confirmed R. The feedback will clarify R\'s true position and reveal if S, T, U, or Y are present.\n\n<guess>rusty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: rusty -> FEEDBACK: R(-) U(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses of feedback:\n1.

From second guess, R at position 1 got \'-\', meaning R is not position 1, so secret R cannot be at position 1.\n\nIn secret word, position 1 cannot be R because in guess 2 R not position 1.\n\nTherefore, words starting with R are invalid if R is at position 1? No-- the secret word might have R at multiple positions? Unlikely, but possible. But the feedback for guess ""rusty"" R at position 1 got \'-\', meaning the letter R is present but not in position 1. So in the secret word, R must exist, but not at position 1. Also, not position 2?

For our guess word, we can put R at position 1? But we know it\'s wrong. Yes, we can—it would waste a slot, but ""RUMOR"" positions: R(1),U(2),M(3),O(4),R(5) — U at 2 is fixed correct, R at 1 will be marked wrong (- or x? x because not present? no, R is present but at another position). Since R is present, placing it at position 1 would get \'-\', which we already know. But it occupies a spot that could be used for a new letter.\n\nSimilarly, R at 5 might be correct or not.\n\nTo maximize new letters, avoid putting R where we know it shouldn\'t be.\n\nIn next guess, put U at position 2 (fixed), then R in a position that might be correct, one of 3,4,5.\n\nFor ""HUMOR"": letters H,U,M,O,R\n- All unused letters except U and R.\n- Probes H, M, O.\n\nAnother possibility: ""LUPUS"" S absent?

We have the feedback from four guesses:

1. **crane**: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - Absent: C, A, N, E
   - R is present but not in position 2.

2. **rusty**: R(-) U(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)
   - Absent: S, T, Y
   - U is present and in the correct position (position 2).
   - R is present but not in position 1.

3. **humor**: H(x) U(✓) M(x) O(x) R(-)
   - Absent: H, M, O
   - U is correct in position 2 (reaffirmed).
   - R is present but not in position 5.

4. **lurid**: L(x) U(✓) R(-) I(-) D(x)
   - Absent: L, D
   - U is correct in position 2 (again).
   - R is present but not in position 3 (since in ""lurid"" R is at position 3 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not at position 3).
   - I is present but not in position 4 (since I is at position 4 and got '-', meaning I is in the word but not at position 4).

Now, combining all feedback:

- **Confirmed absent letters**: C, A, N, E, S, T, Y, H, M, O, L, D (12 letters)
- **Present letters**: 
  - U: fixed in position 2 (✓ in all guesses)
  - R: present, but not in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5. Therefore, R must be in position 4 (the only position left).
  - I: present, but not in position 4 (from guess 4). Since R is now in position 4, I must be in one of the other positions: 1, 3, or 5. But position 2 is U, so I can be in 1, 3, or 5.

From above:
- R must be in position 4 because:
  - Not in 1 (from guess 2)
  - Not in 2 (from guess 1 and position 2 is U)
  - Not in 3 (from guess 4)
  - Not in 5 (from guess 3)
  - So only position 4 left.

Therefore, R is in position 4.

Also, I is present and not in position 4 (from guess 4), so I must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Now, the word structure is: _ U _ R _

And we have I present, so it must be in one of the blanks: position 1, 3, or 5.

But position 4 is R, so I cannot be there.

Now, the remaining positions: 1, 3, 5.

We also have one more letter to find, since the word has 5 letters: positions 1, 3, and 5 need to be filled, but I is one of them, so the other two positions must be filled with other letters, one of which is I, and the other two are unknown.

Actually, we have three positions: 1, 3, 5. One of them is I (since I is present), and the other two are new letters that we don't know about yet.

But we have only one more present letter? No, we know U and R are fixed, and I is present, so there are three known present letters: U, R, I. But the word has five letters, so there are two more letters to be found, which could be from the remaining alphabet.

But we also have absent letters, so we know which letters are not used.

Absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, T, Y, H, M, O, L, D

So available letters: B, F, G, I, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

But I is already present, so it can be used, but we need to find where.

The word: position 1, 2:U, 3, 4:R, 5:?

But position 3 is also unknown.

So pattern: [1] U [3] R [5]

With I in one of positions 1, 3, or 5.

And the other two positions must be filled with letters from available: B, F, G, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (since I is already one, but it could be in one position, and the other two positions are different letters? Not necessarily, there could be duplicates, but we don't know.

We don't have information about duplicate letters, so it's possible.

But for now, let's list possible words.

First, since I is present and not in position 4, and positions available: 1,3,5.

We need to find 5-letter words of the form _ U _ R _ with the constraints.

Available letters for positions 1,3,5: from B,F,G,I,K,P,Q,V,W,X,Z

But I must be in one of these positions.

Possible cases:

- If I in position 1: I U _ R _
- If I in position 3: _ U I R _
- If I in position 5: _ U _ R I

Now, we need to fill the remaining two positions with letters from the available set, excluding I if not used, but I is used once, so the other letters can be from the set.

But we need to form valid English words.

Let's list possible words for each case.

First, I in position 1: I U _ R _

The third and fifth positions need to be filled.

For example: I U ? R ?

Possible: ""I U G R ?"" or ""I U P R ?"" etc.

Words: ""JURY"" not 5 letters.

""INURE"" but N and E absent? N absent, E absent.

""INURN"" N absent.

""IMPURE"" too long.

5-letter: ""IURAS"" not word.

""IBRIK"" not common.

""IGAPO"" not English.

Unlikely.

Another: ""QUIRK"" but Q U I R K — positions: Q(1), U(2), I(3), R(4), K(5) — but here I is in position 3, not 1.

If I in position 1: e.g., ""I U R R ?"" duplicate R? But R is at position 4, so position 3 cannot be R? We don't know.

But in ""I U ? R ?"", position 3 is not R because R is at 4.

So position 3 is a different letter.

Possible words: I U B R K? Not word.

I U G R I? But I at 1 and 5? Possible, but ""IUGRI"" not word.

I think no common words with I at position 1.

Now, I in position 3: _ U I R _

So pattern: ? U I R ?

Position 1 and 5 to fill.

Available letters: B,F,G,K,P,Q,V,W,X,Z

Examples: ""B U I R D"" but D absent? D is absent from guess 4.

D absent.

""F U I R Y"" Y absent.

""G U I R K"" not word.

""K U I R ?"" ""KUIR"" not.

""P U I R S"" S absent.

""Q U I R E"" E absent.

""V U I R ?"" not.

""W U I R ?"" not.

""QUIRT"" Q U I R T — but T absent? T absent from guess 2.

T absent.

""QUIRK"" Q U I R K — positions: Q(1), U(2), I(3), R(4), K(5). This fits: I in position 3.

And letters: Q, U, I, R, K. Q and K are available? Q is in available, K is in available.

""QUIRK"" is a valid English word meaning a peculiar behavior.

And it uses Q and K, which are untested.

But Q is rare, but it's possible.

Now, I in position 5: _ U _ R I

Pattern: ? U ? R I

Position 1 and 3 to fill.

Available letters: B,F,G,K,P,Q,V,W,X,Z

Examples: ""B U G R I"" -> ""BUGRI"" not word.

""F U G R I"" ""FUGRI"" not.

""G U P R I"" ""GUPRI"" not.

""K U B R I"" ""KUBRI"" not.

""P U B R I"" ""PUBRI"" not, but ""PUBIS"" S absent.

""Q U A R I"" A absent.

""V U L R I"" L absent.

""W U D R I"" D absent.

""BURRI"" B U R R I — but R at position 3 and 4? But in this pattern, position 3 is ?, and position 4 is R, so if position 3 is R, then it would be duplicate R.

""BURRI"" is B(1) U(2) R(3) R(4) I(5) — but R at position 3 and 4. But from feedback, we have R present, but we don't know if it appears once or multiple times. However, in previous guesses, we only had one R, so it might be single.

But ""BURRI"" is not a common word; ""burrito"" is longer.

""PURRI"" not word.

So the only common word seems to be ""QUIRK"" with I in position 3.

But in ""QUIRK"", I is at position 3, which matches the pattern.

And we have I present and not in position 4, which is satisfied.

Now, are there other possibilities?

Another word: ""GUILD"" but L and D absent? L and D are absent.

""BUILD"" same.

""FLUID"" F L U I D — L and D absent, and U at position 3? Not position 2.

No.

""JUMAR"" not.

So ""QUIRK"" seems to be the only common word that fits.

But let's confirm the feedback.

In ""QUIRK"":
- Position 1: Q
- Position 2: U (should be correct)
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: R (should be correct, since we deduced R is in position 4)
- Position 5: K

Now, from feedback, we know I is present but not in position 4, which is true, it's in position 3.

And R is in position 4, which we think is correct.

But we need to guess this to confirm.

Perhaps there are other words.

What about ""EQUIP"" E absent.

""OUIJA"" O absent.

I think ""QUIRK"" is the best bet.

But we have to consider if there are words with I in other positions.

For example, I in position 1: ""I U R R I"" not word.

Or ""IZARD"" Z, but A and D absent.

No.

I in position 5: ""CURRI"" C absent.

""FURRI"" not word.

So ""QUIRK"" is the only reasonable option.

Therefore, we guess ""QUIRK"".

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from All Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
     - Absent: C, A, N, E  
     - R is present but not in position 2.
   - **Guess 2 (rusty)**: R(-), U(✓), S(x), T(x), Y(x)  
     - Absent: S, T, Y  
     - U is correct and in position 2.  
     - R is present but not in position 1.
   - **Guess 3 (humor)**: H(x), U(✓), M(x), O(x), R(-)  
     - Absent: H, M, O  
     - U is correct in position 2 (reaffirmed).  
     - R is present but not in position 5.
   - **Guess 4 (lurid)**: L(x), U(✓), R(-), I(-), D(x)  
     - Absent: L, D  
     - U is correct in position 2 (reaffirmed).  
     - R is present but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and marked '-').  
     - I is present but not in position 4 (since it was guessed in position 4 and marked '-').

2. **Combine All Feedback**:
   - **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, E, S, T, Y, H, M, O, L, D (12 letters eliminated).  
   - **Present Letters**:
     - U is fixed in position 2 (✓ from all guesses).  
     - R must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 2 (from Guess 1 and 2), 3 (from Guess 4), or 5 (from Guess 3). The only remaining position is 4. **Thus, R is in position 4.**  
     - I is present but not in position 4 (from Guess 4). Since position 4 is now R, I must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
   - **Word Structure**: The secret word is `_ U _ R _`, with:
     - Position 2: U (fixed).  
     - Position 4: R (fixed).  
     - Position 1, 3, or 5: I (present, but exact position unknown).  
     - The remaining two positions must be filled with letters not in the absent list.  
   - **Remaining Possible Letters**: B, F, G, I, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (I is confirmed present, so it must appear once).  

3. **Deduce Possible Words**:
   - Given the structure `_ U _ R _` and the constraints:  
     - I must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
     - The other positions must use letters from the remaining pool (B, F, G, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z).  
   - **Evaluate Cases for I's Position**:
     - **I in position 1**: Pattern `I U _ R _`. No common English words fit (e.g., ""IURGA"" invalid).  
     - **I in position 3**: Pattern `_ U I R _`. Possible word: **QUIRK** (Q U I R K).  
       - Valid English word (meaning a peculiar trait).  
       - Uses Q (position 1), U (position 2, fixed), I (position 3), R (position 4, fixed), K (position 5).  
       - All letters (Q, K) are from the remaining pool.  
     - **I in position 5**: Pattern `_ U _ R I`. No common English words fit (e.g., ""BURKI"" invalid).  
   - **Conclusion**: **QUIRK** is the only viable word that matches all constraints. It tests:
     - I in position 3 (if correct, we get ✓; if not, I must be in position 1 or 5, but position 1/5 cases are invalid, so this must be the word).  
     - Q and K as new letters (highly informative if absent or misplaced).  

4. **Why This Guess?**:
   - Confirms the position of I (if I is in position 3, it should be ✓; if not, we have a contradiction, but no other words exist).  
   - If correct, solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on Q and K will reveal the remaining letters (though no other valid words fit the constraints).  

<guess>quirk</guess>",quirk,"We have the feedback from four guesses:

1. **crane**: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - Absent: C, A, N, E
   - R is present but not in position 2.

2. **rusty**: R(-) U(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)
   - Absent: S, T, Y
   - U is present and in the correct position (position 2).
   - R is present but not in position 1.

3. **humor**: H(x) U(✓) M(x) O(x) R(-)
   - Absent: H, M, O
   - U is correct in position 2 (reaffirmed).
   - R is present but not in position 5.

4. **lurid**: L(x) U(✓) R(-) I(-) D(x)
   - Absent: L, D
   - U is correct in position 2 (again).
   - R is present but not in position 3 (since in ""lurid"" R is at position 3 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not at position 3).
   - I is present but not in position 4 (since I is at position 4 and got '-', meaning I is in the word but not at position 4).

Now, combining all feedback:

- **Confirmed absent letters**: C, A, N, E, S, T, Y, H, M, O, L, D (12 letters)
- **Present letters**: 
  - U: fixed in position 2 (✓ in all guesses)
  - R: present, but not in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5. Therefore, R must be in position 4 (the only position left).
  - I: present, but not in position 4 (from guess 4). Since R is now in position 4, I must be in one of the other positions: 1, 3, or 5. But position 2 is U, so I can be in 1, 3, or 5.

From above:
- R must be in position 4 because:
  - Not in 1 (from guess 2)
  - Not in 2 (from guess 1 and position 2 is U)
  - Not in 3 (from guess 4)
  - Not in 5 (from guess 3)
  - So only position 4 left.

Therefore, R is in position 4.

Also, I is present and not in position 4 (from guess 4), so I must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Now, the word structure is: _ U _ R _

And we have I present, so it must be in one of the blanks: position 1, 3, or 5.

But position 4 is R, so I cannot be there.

Now, the remaining positions: 1, 3, 5.

We also have one more letter to find, since the word has 5 letters: positions 1, 3, and 5 need to be filled, but I is one of them, so the other two positions must be filled with other letters, one of which is I, and the other two are unknown.

Actually, we have three positions: 1, 3, 5. One of them is I (since I is present), and the other two are new letters that we don't know about yet.

But we have only one more present letter? No, we know U and R are fixed, and I is present, so there are three known present letters: U, R, I. But the word has five letters, so there are two more letters to be found, which could be from the remaining alphabet.

But we also have absent letters, so we know which letters are not used.

Absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, T, Y, H, M, O, L, D

So available letters: B, F, G, I, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

But I is already present, so it can be used, but we need to find where.

The word: position 1, 2:U, 3, 4:R, 5:?

But position 3 is also unknown.

So pattern: [1] U [3] R [5]

With I in one of positions 1, 3, or 5.

And the other two positions must be filled with letters from available: B, F, G, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (since I is already one, but it could be in one position, and the other two positions are different letters? Not necessarily, there could be duplicates, but we don't know.

We don't have information about duplicate letters, so it's possible.

But for now, let's list possible words.

First, since I is present and not in position 4, and positions available: 1,3,5.

We need to find 5-letter words of the form _ U _ R _ with the constraints.

Available letters for positions 1,3,5: from B,F,G,I,K,P,Q,V,W,X,Z

But I must be in one of these positions.

Possible cases:

- If I in position 1: I U _ R _
- If I in position 3: _ U I R _
- If I in position 5: _ U _ R I

Now, we need to fill the remaining two positions with letters from the available set, excluding I if not used, but I is used once, so the other letters can be from the set.

But we need to form valid English words.

Let's list possible words for each case.

First, I in position 1: I U _ R _

The third and fifth positions need to be filled.

For example: I U ? R ?

Possible: ""I U G R ?"" or ""I U P R ?"" etc.

Words: ""JURY"" not 5 letters.

""INURE"" but N and E absent? N absent, E absent.

""INURN"" N absent.

""IMPURE"" too long.

5-letter: ""IURAS"" not word.

""IBRIK"" not common.

""IGAPO"" not English.

Unlikely.

Another: ""QUIRK"" but Q U I R K — positions: Q(1), U(2), I(3), R(4), K(5) — but here I is in position 3, not 1.

If I in position 1: e.g., ""I U R R ?"" duplicate R? But R is at position 4, so position 3 cannot be R? We don't know.

But in ""I U ? R ?"", position 3 is not R because R is at 4.

So position 3 is a different letter.

Possible words: I U B R K? Not word.

I U G R I? But I at 1 and 5? Possible, but ""IUGRI"" not word.

I think no common words with I at position 1.

Now, I in position 3: _ U I R _

So pattern: ? U I R ?

Position 1 and 5 to fill.

Available letters: B,F,G,K,P,Q,V,W,X,Z

Examples: ""B U I R D"" but D absent? D is absent from guess 4.

D absent.

""F U I R Y"" Y absent.

""G U I R K"" not word.

""K U I R ?"" ""KUIR"" not.

""P U I R S"" S absent.

""Q U I R E"" E absent.

""V U I R ?"" not.

""W U I R ?"" not.

""QUIRT"" Q U I R T — but T absent? T absent from guess 2.

T absent.

""QUIRK"" Q U I R K — positions: Q(1), U(2), I(3), R(4), K(5). This fits: I in position 3.

And letters: Q, U, I, R, K. Q and K are available? Q is in available, K is in available.

""QUIRK"" is a valid English word meaning a peculiar behavior.

And it uses Q and K, which are untested.

But Q is rare, but it's possible.

Now, I in position 5: _ U _ R I

Pattern: ? U ? R I

Position 1 and 3 to fill.

Available letters: B,F,G,K,P,Q,V,W,X,Z

Examples: ""B U G R I"" -> ""BUGRI"" not word.

""F U G R I"" ""FUGRI"" not.

""G U P R I"" ""GUPRI"" not.

""K U B R I"" ""KUBRI"" not.

""P U B R I"" ""PUBRI"" not, but ""PUBIS"" S absent.

""Q U A R I"" A absent.

""V U L R I"" L absent.

""W U D R I"" D absent.

""BURRI"" B U R R I — but R at position 3 and 4? But in this pattern, position 3 is ?, and position 4 is R, so if position 3 is R, then it would be duplicate R.

""BURRI"" is B(1) U(2) R(3) R(4) I(5) — but R at position 3 and 4. But from feedback, we have R present, but we don't know if it appears once or multiple times. However, in previous guesses, we only had one R, so it might be single.

But ""BURRI"" is not a common word; ""burrito"" is longer.

""PURRI"" not word.

So the only common word seems to be ""QUIRK"" with I in position 3.

But in ""QUIRK"", I is at position 3, which matches the pattern.

And we have I present and not in position 4, which is satisfied.

Now, are there other possibilities?

Another word: ""GUILD"" but L and D absent? L and D are absent.

""BUILD"" same.

""FLUID"" F L U I D — L and D absent, and U at position 3? Not position 2.

No.

""JUMAR"" not.

So ""QUIRK"" seems to be the only common word that fits.

But let's confirm the feedback.

In ""QUIRK"":
- Position 1: Q
- Position 2: U (should be correct)
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: R (should be correct, since we deduced R is in position 4)
- Position 5: K

Now, from feedback, we know I is present but not in position 4, which is true, it's in position 3.

And R is in position 4, which we think is correct.

But we need to guess this to confirm.

Perhaps there are other words.

What about ""EQUIP"" E absent.

""OUIJA"" O absent.

I think ""QUIRK"" is the best bet.

But we have to consider if there are words with I in other positions.

For example, I in position 1: ""I U R R I"" not word.

Or ""IZARD"" Z, but A and D absent.

No.

I in position 5: ""CURRI"" C absent.

""FURRI"" not word.

So ""QUIRK"" is the only reasonable option.

Therefore, we guess ""QUIRK"".

<guess>quirk</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from All Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
     - Absent: C, A, N, E  
     - R is present but not in position 2.
   - **Guess 2 (rusty)**: R(-), U(✓), S(x), T(x), Y(x)  
     - Absent: S, T, Y  
     - U is correct and in position 2.  
     - R is present but not in position 1.
   - **Guess 3 (humor)**: H(x), U(✓), M(x), O(x), R(-)  
     - Absent: H, M, O  
     - U is correct in position 2 (reaffirmed).  
     - R is present but not in position 5.
   - **Guess 4 (lurid)**: L(x), U(✓), R(-), I(-), D(x)  
     - Absent: L, D  
     - U is correct in position 2 (reaffirmed).  
     - R is present but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and marked '-').  
     - I is present but not in position 4 (since it was guessed in position 4 and marked '-').

2. **Combine All Feedback**:
   - **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, E, S, T, Y, H, M, O, L, D (12 letters eliminated).  
   - **Present Letters**:
     - U is fixed in position 2 (✓ from all guesses).  
     - R must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 2 (from Guess 1 and 2), 3 (from Guess 4), or 5 (from Guess 3). The only remaining position is 4. **Thus, R is in position 4.**  
     - I is present but not in position 4 (from Guess 4). Since position 4 is now R, I must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
   - **Word Structure**: The secret word is `_ U _ R _`, with:
     - Position 2: U (fixed).  
     - Position 4: R (fixed).  
     - Position 1, 3, or 5: I (present, but exact position unknown).  
     - The remaining two positions must be filled with letters not in the absent list.  
   - **Remaining Possible Letters**: B, F, G, I, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (I is confirmed present, so it must appear once).  

3. **Deduce Possible Words**:
   - Given the structure `_ U _ R _` and the constraints:  
     - I must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
     - The other positions must use letters from the remaining pool (B, F, G, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z).  
   - **Evaluate Cases for I's Position**:
     - **I in position 1**: Pattern `I U _ R _`. No common English words fit (e.g., ""IURGA"" invalid).  
     - **I in position 3**: Pattern `_ U I R _`. Possible word: **QUIRK** (Q U I R K).  
       - Valid English word (meaning a peculiar trait).  
       - Uses Q (position 1), U (position 2, fixed), I (position 3), R (position 4, fixed), K (position 5).  
       - All letters (Q, K) are from the remaining pool.  
     - **I in position 5**: Pattern `_ U _ R I`. No common English words fit (e.g., ""BURKI"" invalid).  
   - **Conclusion**: **QUIRK** is the only viable word that matches all constraints. It tests:
     - I in position 3 (if correct, we get ✓; if not, I must be in position 1 or 5, but position 1/5 cases are invalid, so this must be the word).  
     - Q and K as new letters (highly informative if absent or misplaced).  

4. **Why This Guess?**:
   - Confirms the position of I (if I is in position 3, it should be ✓; if not, we have a contradiction, but no other words exist).  
   - If correct, solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on Q and K will reveal the remaining letters (though no other valid words fit the constraints).",Guess 5: quirk -> FEEDBACK: Q(✓) U(✓) I(✓) R(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
