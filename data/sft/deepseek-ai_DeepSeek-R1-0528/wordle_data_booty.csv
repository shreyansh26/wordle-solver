We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word at all.
 Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of these five letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Since none of these letters are in the word, we must choose a new word that avoids all of these letters.

 We need to pick a word that uses entirely different letters. Also, we want to cover common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Common vowels that weren't in the first guess: I, O, U (we've tried A and E, now avoid them). Also, common consonants we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, L, M, P, S, T, etc.

 A good candidate might be a word like ""SPLIT"" or ""GHOUL"", but let me think of words that use high-frequency letters we haven't tried.

 Options:
   - We can try ""MOIST"": uses M, O, I, S, T -> all new letters.
   - Another option: ""PUDGY"" but less common.

 However, we must note that the word must be a valid English word.

 Alternatively, consider ""LIGHT"" (L, I, G, H, T) or ""POUND"" (P, O, U, N, D) but we know N is out from previous feedback? Actually, in the feedback N was x, meaning N is not in the word. But we are avoiding C, R, A, N, E.

 Since ""MOIST"" uses M, O, I, S, T and none of these C,R,A,N,E, it should be safe. Also, it's a common word.

 However, let's check frequency of letters:
   After removing C,R,A,N,E, high frequency letters are O, I, S, T, L, U, B, D, G, H, M, P.

 ""MOIST"" covers O, I, S, T, M. That's good.

 Alternatively ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D -> also good.

 But note: we have only 6 tries and we want maximum information. ""MOIST"" has two vowels (O,I) and three consonants, which is balanced.

 Another candidate: ""POINT"" (P, O, I, N, T) but N is already excluded? Wait, no: N was excluded, so N cannot be used. So ""POINT"" is invalid because it contains N? Let me see:
   Our first guess feedback said N(x), meaning there is no N. So we must avoid N.

 Therefore, ""POINT"" contains N -> invalid.

 So words we can use: ""MOIST"", ""BUILD"", ""GHOUL"", ""SPLIT"", etc.

 Considering ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T -> these are all new and avoid banned letters.

 Similarly, ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> also good.

 Which word? ""SOUTH"" (S, O, U, T, H) is another candidate.

 I think ""MOIST"" and ""SPLIT"" are both strong because they have S and T which are very common.

 Let me pick ""MOIST"" for this guess.

 Alternatively, we can pick ""GHOUL"" but it has G, H, O, U, L which are less common and U is less frequent. But avoiding previously tried letters is necessary.

 Since ""MOIST"" uses 5 letters that are all high frequency and we haven't tried, it should be good.

 So, I'll guess ""MOIST"".

After the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", we know that the letters **C, R, A, N, and E** are **not in the secret word**. Therefore, we need a new guess that avoids these letters entirely and tests new common letters.

We have feedback from two guesses:

1. ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as 'x', meaning none of these letters are in the secret word.
2. ""moist"": 
   - M: x (not in the word)
   - O: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, so the second letter of the secret word is O)
   - I: x (not in the word)
   - S: x (not in the word)
   - T: - (in the word but in the wrong position)

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the letter O in the second position: _ O _ _ _
- The secret word contains the letter T, but not in the last position (since in ""moist"" it was at the end and got a '-', meaning it's present but not at the end).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

Also, note that T is in the word but not at the end. Since the second position is O, T must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait, in ""moist"", T was in position 5 and got a '-', meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So T must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

However, we must avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has O as the second letter.
- Contains T, but not at the end (so not in position 5) and not in position 2 (which is O).
- Avoids the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

Possible positions for T: 1, 3, or 4.

We also need to choose other letters that are not in the excluded set. The available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and T, but we are using T once, and O is fixed at position 2).

We should try to cover more common letters to maximize information.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern: [letter1] O [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

With T being in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.

Option 1: T in position 1 -> T O _ _ _
Option 2: T in position 3 -> _ O T _ _
Option 3: T in position 4 -> _ O _ T _

We also know that the word must contain T and O (and O is fixed at position 2).

Let's consider common words:

For T in position 1: 
  - TOUCH? But C is excluded -> invalid.
  - TOUGH? G and H are allowed. Pattern: T O U G H -> but we have U, G, H. Also, we haven't tried U, G, H. So ""tough"" is a candidate.

For T in position 3:
  - _ O T _ _ : e.g., ""MOTEL"" -> but M and E are excluded. 
  - ""POTTY"" -> P, O, T, T, Y -> but T is repeated? And we don't know if T is repeated. Also, Y is allowed. However, we have two T's? The feedback for ""moist"" had only one T and it was marked as present. But the secret word might have two T's? We don't know. But in ""moist"" we only had one T, and it was marked as present, so at least one T. But the word could have more.

But we must avoid S, which is in ""potty""? No, ""potty"" has no S. But we have to check the letters: P, O, T, T, Y. Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S -> none of these, so it's allowed. However, we have two T's. But the feedback for ""moist"" only told us about one T? Actually, the feedback per letter: in ""moist"", the T was at the end and marked as present. If the word had two T's, we might have gotten more feedback? But in ""moist"" we only provided one T, so we don't know about duplicates. So ""potty"" is a possibility.

But let's look for more common words.

Another option for T in position 3: ""BOTCH"" -> but C is excluded. ""DOTTY"" -> D, O, T, T, Y -> again, two T's.

For T in position 4: _ O _ T _
  - e.g., ""FORTY"" -> but F, O, R, T, Y -> R is excluded (from first guess: R was x). So invalid.
  - ""POUTY"" -> P, O, U, T, Y -> no excluded letters? P, O, U, T, Y: O is fixed, P, U, T, Y are allowed. So ""pouty"" is a candidate.

But note: we have T in position 4. And in ""moist"", T was at position 5 and was marked as present but wrong position. So if T is at position 4 in the secret word, then in ""moist"" (which had T at position 5) we would get a '-' for T, which we did. So that matches.

Now, we have two strong candidates: 
  - ""tough"" (T at position 1)
  - ""pouty"" (T at position 4)

But we also have the option of T at position 3, e.g., ""potty"", but that has two T's. We don't know if the word has two T's, so we might get less information if we guess a word with duplicate letters. It's better to avoid duplicates to cover more letters.

So let's avoid duplicates for now.

Therefore, ""tough"" and ""pouty"" both have unique letters.

""tough"": T, O, U, G, H -> letters: T, O, U, G, H. We know O is fixed at position 2. So the word is T O U G H.

""pouty"": P, O, U, T, Y -> P, O, U, T, Y. Pattern: P O U T Y.

Which one to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible.

We have not tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Both words use U. ""tough"" uses T, U, G, H. ""pouty"" uses P, U, T, Y.

We already know T is in the word, so we don't need to test T again? But we are including T to confirm its position. However, we are forced to include T because we know it's in the word.

But we can choose a word that doesn't have T? No, because we must include T? Actually, we don't have to, but we know T is in the word, so if we don't include T, we might not get information about its position. But we are trying to find the word, so we should use the information we have.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T and also other new letters.

But both words are valid.

Another idea: we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has O, and we haven't tried U (which is a vowel). Both words have U.

But we also know that the word does not have A, E, I (from previous feedback). So the only vowels left are O (which we have) and U. So the word might have U.

We can also consider words without U? But we don't have to.

Let's list more words without duplicates and without excluded letters:

Pattern: _ O _ _ _

With T in the word, but not at position 2 or 5? Actually, in the feedback for ""moist"", T was at position 5 and got a '-', meaning T is in the word but not at position 5. So T can be at 1, 3, or 4.

Words with T at 1: 
  - TOUCH (invalid: C)
  - TOUGH (valid: T, O, U, G, H)
  - TOUR? (5 letters? no, tour is 4)
  - TOUTS (invalid: S) -> S is excluded.
  - TOUZY? (not common, and Z and Y are less common)

Words with T at 3:
  - _ O T _ _ : 
      - BOTCH (invalid: C)
      - DOTAL (invalid: A) -> A is excluded.
      - DOTED (invalid: E and D? D is allowed, but E is excluded) -> E is excluded.
      - GOTHS (invalid: S) -> S excluded.
      - LOTTE (invalid: E) -> E excluded.
      - MOTHS (invalid: M and S) -> M and S excluded.
      - NOTCH (invalid: N and C) -> N and C excluded.
      - POTTY (valid, but duplicate T) -> we avoid duplicates for now.
      - ROTCH (invalid: R and C) -> R excluded.
      - WOT? (not 5 letters)

  So few options without duplicates? Actually, ""POTTY"" is one, but duplicates.

Words with T at 4:
  - _ O _ T _ :
      - FORTH (invalid: R) -> R excluded.
      - FORTY (invalid: R) -> R excluded.
      - POUTY (valid: P, O, U, T, Y) -> no duplicates, and no excluded letters.
      - DOUTY? (not common, but D, O, U, T, Y -> valid, but we prefer common words)
      - GOUTY (valid: G, O, U, T, Y) -> same as pouty but with G instead of P.

So we have:
  - TOUGH (T at 1)
  - POUTY (T at 4)
  - GOUTY (T at 4) 

We can also consider other words without T? But we know T is in the word, so we should include it to get position information.

But we don't have to include T in every guess? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient. Since we know T is in the word, we can try to find its position.

Given that, let's choose between ""tough"" and ""pouty"".

We want to cover more new letters. 
- ""tough"": uses T, O, U, G, H -> new letters: U, G, H (T and O we already know about, but O is fixed and T is known to be present).
- ""pouty"": uses P, O, U, T, Y -> new letters: P, U, Y.

We haven't tried U, G, H, P, Y. Both are good.

But note: we have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We want to maximize information.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have T? But that might not help us locate T. However, if we don't include T, we might not get information about its position, but we can test other letters. But we know T is in the word, so we can use that to our advantage by including it.

But let me think: we can also try to use a word that has T in a different position than we are considering? We are considering positions 1,3,4. We can test T in position 3, for example, without duplicates.

But we couldn't find a common word without duplicates for T in position 3. So let's stick with T in position 1 or 4.

Another candidate: ""DOUBT"" -> D, O, U, B, T. Pattern: D O U B T. 
- This has T at the end? But in the feedback for ""moist"", T was at the end and got a '-', meaning T is not at position 5. So if we put T at position 5 again, we know it will be wrong. But we are trying to find the position of T. So ""doubt"" has T at position 5, which we know is incorrect. So that would be a waste? Because we know T is not at position 5, so we shouldn't put it there.

Therefore, we must avoid putting T at position 5.

So ""doubt"" is invalid because it places T at position 5, which we know is wrong.

Similarly, we must avoid putting T at position 2 because that is O.

So we are left with positions 1, 3, 4.

Now, let's choose between ""tough"" and ""pouty"". Both are valid and common.

We can also consider ""BOUGH"" (B, O, U, G, H) -> but this does not contain T. We know T is in the word, so if we guess ""bough"", we might not get information about T. However, we can still use it to test other letters.

But if we guess ""bough"", and the secret word has T, then we will get feedback that we are missing T? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. So if we guess ""bough"", we will get:
  - B: ? 
  - O: ✓ (fixed at position 2)
  - U: ? 
  - G: ? 
  - H: ?

And we won't get any information about T because we didn't guess it. But we already know T is in the word, so we don't need to confirm that. However, we don't know the position of T. So if we don't include T, we won't learn where it is.

Therefore, it's better to include T in our guess to narrow down its position.

So we go back to including T.

Now, between ""tough"" and ""pouty"", which one? 

We can also consider ""GOUTY"" (G, O, U, T, Y) which is similar to ""pouty"" but with G instead of P.

But let's pick one that uses more common consonants. 

I think ""tough"" is a good choice because it uses G and H, which are common.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position we are unsure about. We have two possibilities: T at 1 or T at 4 (or 3, but we don't have a good word without duplicates). 

We can try to test T at position 1 with ""tough"". If the feedback shows T as ✓, then we know T is at position 1. If not, then T must be at position 3 or 4. But if we get T as 'x', that would be a problem because we know T is in the word. But in ""tough"", T is at position 1, so if the secret word has T at position 1, we get ✓. If T is at position 3 or 4, then we would get T as '-' (because it's in the word but not at position 1). But we know T is in the word, so it cannot be 'x'. So we will either get ✓ or '-'.

Similarly, if we choose ""pouty"", T is at position 4. Then we will get either ✓ (if T is at position 4) or '-' (if T is at position 1 or 3).

So both are valid.

But note: if we choose ""tough"" and T is not at position 1, we get T as '-', and we still don't know if it's at 3 or 4. Similarly, if we choose ""pouty"" and T is not at 4, we get T as '-' and we don't know if it's at 1 or 3.

So we might need another guess to disambiguate.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in position 3? But we don't have a common word without duplicates. 

What about ""BOUTS""? But S is excluded. Invalid.

""DOUTT""? Not a word.

""LOUTY""? Not common, but L, O, U, T, Y -> valid? But ""louty"" is not a common word. We should stick to common words.

Another idea: ""THUMB"" -> T, H, U, M, B -> but M is excluded (from ""moist"" feedback: M was x). So invalid.

""LOTUS"" -> L, O, T, U, S -> but S is excluded. Invalid.

So we are limited.

Therefore, I think we should go with ""tough"" or ""pouty"". Let's choose ""tough"" because it uses G and H, which are common.

So guess: ""tough""

But let me check: the pattern is T O U G H.

We know O is at position 2, so that's fixed.

If the secret word is ""tough"", we get it right. Otherwise, we get feedback.

But the secret word might be something else, like ""pouty"" or ""gouty"", but we are guessing ""tough"".

We are on the third guess, so we have room.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't fix T to one position but tests multiple possibilities? But that's hard.

Another candidate: ""PUTTY"" -> but duplicate T and we avoid duplicates.

I think ""tough"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with ""tough"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E not in the word).
- ""moist"" showed:
  - O is correct and in position 2 (so the secret word is `_ O _ _ _`).
  - T is in the word but not in position 5 (since it received `-`).
  - M, I, S are not in the word.

The secret word must:
- Have O as the second letter.
- Contain T, but not in position 5 (positions 1, 3, or 4 are possible).
- Exclude C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

For the next guess, ""tough"" is chosen because:
- It tests T in position 1 (to check if T is in position 1).
- It uses new common letters (U, G, H) to gather more information.
- It avoids all excluded letters and fits the pattern `_ O _ _ _`.

<guess>tough</guess>",tough,"We have feedback from two guesses:

1. ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as 'x', meaning none of these letters are in the secret word.
2. ""moist"": 
   - M: x (not in the word)
   - O: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, so the second letter of the secret word is O)
   - I: x (not in the word)
   - S: x (not in the word)
   - T: - (in the word but in the wrong position)

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the letter O in the second position: _ O _ _ _
- The secret word contains the letter T, but not in the last position (since in ""moist"" it was at the end and got a '-', meaning it's present but not at the end).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

Also, note that T is in the word but not at the end. Since the second position is O, T must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait, in ""moist"", T was in position 5 and got a '-', meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So T must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

However, we must avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has O as the second letter.
- Contains T, but not at the end (so not in position 5) and not in position 2 (which is O).
- Avoids the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

Possible positions for T: 1, 3, or 4.

We also need to choose other letters that are not in the excluded set. The available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and T, but we are using T once, and O is fixed at position 2).

We should try to cover more common letters to maximize information.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern: [letter1] O [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

With T being in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.

Option 1: T in position 1 -> T O _ _ _
Option 2: T in position 3 -> _ O T _ _
Option 3: T in position 4 -> _ O _ T _

We also know that the word must contain T and O (and O is fixed at position 2).

Let's consider common words:

For T in position 1: 
  - TOUCH? But C is excluded -> invalid.
  - TOUGH? G and H are allowed. Pattern: T O U G H -> but we have U, G, H. Also, we haven't tried U, G, H. So ""tough"" is a candidate.

For T in position 3:
  - _ O T _ _ : e.g., ""MOTEL"" -> but M and E are excluded. 
  - ""POTTY"" -> P, O, T, T, Y -> but T is repeated? And we don't know if T is repeated. Also, Y is allowed. However, we have two T's? The feedback for ""moist"" had only one T and it was marked as present. But the secret word might have two T's? We don't know. But in ""moist"" we only had one T, and it was marked as present, so at least one T. But the word could have more.

But we must avoid S, which is in ""potty""? No, ""potty"" has no S. But we have to check the letters: P, O, T, T, Y. Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S -> none of these, so it's allowed. However, we have two T's. But the feedback for ""moist"" only told us about one T? Actually, the feedback per letter: in ""moist"", the T was at the end and marked as present. If the word had two T's, we might have gotten more feedback? But in ""moist"" we only provided one T, so we don't know about duplicates. So ""potty"" is a possibility.

But let's look for more common words.

Another option for T in position 3: ""BOTCH"" -> but C is excluded. ""DOTTY"" -> D, O, T, T, Y -> again, two T's.

For T in position 4: _ O _ T _
  - e.g., ""FORTY"" -> but F, O, R, T, Y -> R is excluded (from first guess: R was x). So invalid.
  - ""POUTY"" -> P, O, U, T, Y -> no excluded letters? P, O, U, T, Y: O is fixed, P, U, T, Y are allowed. So ""pouty"" is a candidate.

But note: we have T in position 4. And in ""moist"", T was at position 5 and was marked as present but wrong position. So if T is at position 4 in the secret word, then in ""moist"" (which had T at position 5) we would get a '-' for T, which we did. So that matches.

Now, we have two strong candidates: 
  - ""tough"" (T at position 1)
  - ""pouty"" (T at position 4)

But we also have the option of T at position 3, e.g., ""potty"", but that has two T's. We don't know if the word has two T's, so we might get less information if we guess a word with duplicate letters. It's better to avoid duplicates to cover more letters.

So let's avoid duplicates for now.

Therefore, ""tough"" and ""pouty"" both have unique letters.

""tough"": T, O, U, G, H -> letters: T, O, U, G, H. We know O is fixed at position 2. So the word is T O U G H.

""pouty"": P, O, U, T, Y -> P, O, U, T, Y. Pattern: P O U T Y.

Which one to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible.

We have not tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Both words use U. ""tough"" uses T, U, G, H. ""pouty"" uses P, U, T, Y.

We already know T is in the word, so we don't need to test T again? But we are including T to confirm its position. However, we are forced to include T because we know it's in the word.

But we can choose a word that doesn't have T? No, because we must include T? Actually, we don't have to, but we know T is in the word, so if we don't include T, we might not get information about its position. But we are trying to find the word, so we should use the information we have.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T and also other new letters.

But both words are valid.

Another idea: we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has O, and we haven't tried U (which is a vowel). Both words have U.

But we also know that the word does not have A, E, I (from previous feedback). So the only vowels left are O (which we have) and U. So the word might have U.

We can also consider words without U? But we don't have to.

Let's list more words without duplicates and without excluded letters:

Pattern: _ O _ _ _

With T in the word, but not at position 2 or 5? Actually, in the feedback for ""moist"", T was at position 5 and got a '-', meaning T is in the word but not at position 5. So T can be at 1, 3, or 4.

Words with T at 1: 
  - TOUCH (invalid: C)
  - TOUGH (valid: T, O, U, G, H)
  - TOUR? (5 letters? no, tour is 4)
  - TOUTS (invalid: S) -> S is excluded.
  - TOUZY? (not common, and Z and Y are less common)

Words with T at 3:
  - _ O T _ _ : 
      - BOTCH (invalid: C)
      - DOTAL (invalid: A) -> A is excluded.
      - DOTED (invalid: E and D? D is allowed, but E is excluded) -> E is excluded.
      - GOTHS (invalid: S) -> S excluded.
      - LOTTE (invalid: E) -> E excluded.
      - MOTHS (invalid: M and S) -> M and S excluded.
      - NOTCH (invalid: N and C) -> N and C excluded.
      - POTTY (valid, but duplicate T) -> we avoid duplicates for now.
      - ROTCH (invalid: R and C) -> R excluded.
      - WOT? (not 5 letters)

  So few options without duplicates? Actually, ""POTTY"" is one, but duplicates.

Words with T at 4:
  - _ O _ T _ :
      - FORTH (invalid: R) -> R excluded.
      - FORTY (invalid: R) -> R excluded.
      - POUTY (valid: P, O, U, T, Y) -> no duplicates, and no excluded letters.
      - DOUTY? (not common, but D, O, U, T, Y -> valid, but we prefer common words)
      - GOUTY (valid: G, O, U, T, Y) -> same as pouty but with G instead of P.

So we have:
  - TOUGH (T at 1)
  - POUTY (T at 4)
  - GOUTY (T at 4) 

We can also consider other words without T? But we know T is in the word, so we should include it to get position information.

But we don't have to include T in every guess? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient. Since we know T is in the word, we can try to find its position.

Given that, let's choose between ""tough"" and ""pouty"".

We want to cover more new letters. 
- ""tough"": uses T, O, U, G, H -> new letters: U, G, H (T and O we already know about, but O is fixed and T is known to be present).
- ""pouty"": uses P, O, U, T, Y -> new letters: P, U, Y.

We haven't tried U, G, H, P, Y. Both are good.

But note: we have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We want to maximize information.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have T? But that might not help us locate T. However, if we don't include T, we might not get information about its position, but we can test other letters. But we know T is in the word, so we can use that to our advantage by including it.

But let me think: we can also try to use a word that has T in a different position than we are considering? We are considering positions 1,3,4. We can test T in position 3, for example, without duplicates.

But we couldn't find a common word without duplicates for T in position 3. So let's stick with T in position 1 or 4.

Another candidate: ""DOUBT"" -> D, O, U, B, T. Pattern: D O U B T. 
- This has T at the end? But in the feedback for ""moist"", T was at the end and got a '-', meaning T is not at position 5. So if we put T at position 5 again, we know it will be wrong. But we are trying to find the position of T. So ""doubt"" has T at position 5, which we know is incorrect. So that would be a waste? Because we know T is not at position 5, so we shouldn't put it there.

Therefore, we must avoid putting T at position 5.

So ""doubt"" is invalid because it places T at position 5, which we know is wrong.

Similarly, we must avoid putting T at position 2 because that is O.

So we are left with positions 1, 3, 4.

Now, let's choose between ""tough"" and ""pouty"". Both are valid and common.

We can also consider ""BOUGH"" (B, O, U, G, H) -> but this does not contain T. We know T is in the word, so if we guess ""bough"", we might not get information about T. However, we can still use it to test other letters.

But if we guess ""bough"", and the secret word has T, then we will get feedback that we are missing T? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. So if we guess ""bough"", we will get:
  - B: ? 
  - O: ✓ (fixed at position 2)
  - U: ? 
  - G: ? 
  - H: ?

And we won't get any information about T because we didn't guess it. But we already know T is in the word, so we don't need to confirm that. However, we don't know the position of T. So if we don't include T, we won't learn where it is.

Therefore, it's better to include T in our guess to narrow down its position.

So we go back to including T.

Now, between ""tough"" and ""pouty"", which one? 

We can also consider ""GOUTY"" (G, O, U, T, Y) which is similar to ""pouty"" but with G instead of P.

But let's pick one that uses more common consonants. 

I think ""tough"" is a good choice because it uses G and H, which are common.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position we are unsure about. We have two possibilities: T at 1 or T at 4 (or 3, but we don't have a good word without duplicates). 

We can try to test T at position 1 with ""tough"". If the feedback shows T as ✓, then we know T is at position 1. If not, then T must be at position 3 or 4. But if we get T as 'x', that would be a problem because we know T is in the word. But in ""tough"", T is at position 1, so if the secret word has T at position 1, we get ✓. If T is at position 3 or 4, then we would get T as '-' (because it's in the word but not at position 1). But we know T is in the word, so it cannot be 'x'. So we will either get ✓ or '-'.

Similarly, if we choose ""pouty"", T is at position 4. Then we will get either ✓ (if T is at position 4) or '-' (if T is at position 1 or 3).

So both are valid.

But note: if we choose ""tough"" and T is not at position 1, we get T as '-', and we still don't know if it's at 3 or 4. Similarly, if we choose ""pouty"" and T is not at 4, we get T as '-' and we don't know if it's at 1 or 3.

So we might need another guess to disambiguate.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in position 3? But we don't have a common word without duplicates. 

What about ""BOUTS""? But S is excluded. Invalid.

""DOUTT""? Not a word.

""LOUTY""? Not common, but L, O, U, T, Y -> valid? But ""louty"" is not a common word. We should stick to common words.

Another idea: ""THUMB"" -> T, H, U, M, B -> but M is excluded (from ""moist"" feedback: M was x). So invalid.

""LOTUS"" -> L, O, T, U, S -> but S is excluded. Invalid.

So we are limited.

Therefore, I think we should go with ""tough"" or ""pouty"". Let's choose ""tough"" because it uses G and H, which are common.

So guess: ""tough""

But let me check: the pattern is T O U G H.

We know O is at position 2, so that's fixed.

If the secret word is ""tough"", we get it right. Otherwise, we get feedback.

But the secret word might be something else, like ""pouty"" or ""gouty"", but we are guessing ""tough"".

We are on the third guess, so we have room.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't fix T to one position but tests multiple possibilities? But that's hard.

Another candidate: ""PUTTY"" -> but duplicate T and we avoid duplicates.

I think ""tough"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with ""tough"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E not in the word).
- ""moist"" showed:
  - O is correct and in position 2 (so the secret word is `_ O _ _ _`).
  - T is in the word but not in position 5 (since it received `-`).
  - M, I, S are not in the word.

The secret word must:
- Have O as the second letter.
- Contain T, but not in position 5 (positions 1, 3, or 4 are possible).
- Exclude C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

For the next guess, ""tough"" is chosen because:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word at all.
 Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of these five letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Since none of these letters are in the word, we must choose a new word that avoids all of these letters.

 We need to pick a word that uses entirely different letters. Also, we want to cover common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Common vowels that weren't in the first guess: I, O, U (we've tried A and E, now avoid them). Also, common consonants we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, L, M, P, S, T, etc.

 A good candidate might be a word like ""SPLIT"" or ""GHOUL"", but let me think of words that use high-frequency letters we haven't tried.

 Options:
   - We can try ""MOIST"": uses M, O, I, S, T -> all new letters.
   - Another option: ""PUDGY"" but less common.

 However, we must note that the word must be a valid English word.

 Alternatively, consider ""LIGHT"" (L, I, G, H, T) or ""POUND"" (P, O, U, N, D) but we know N is out from previous feedback? Actually, in the feedback N was x, meaning N is not in the word. But we are avoiding C, R, A, N, E.

 Since ""MOIST"" uses M, O, I, S, T and none of these C,R,A,N,E, it should be safe. Also, it's a common word.

 However, let's check frequency of letters:
   After removing C,R,A,N,E, high frequency letters are O, I, S, T, L, U, B, D, G, H, M, P.

 ""MOIST"" covers O, I, S, T, M. That's good.

 Alternatively ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D -> also good.

 But note: we have only 6 tries and we want maximum information. ""MOIST"" has two vowels (O,I) and three consonants, which is balanced.

 Another candidate: ""POINT"" (P, O, I, N, T) but N is already excluded? Wait, no: N was excluded, so N cannot be used. So ""POINT"" is invalid because it contains N? Let me see:
   Our first guess feedback said N(x), meaning there is no N. So we must avoid N.

 Therefore, ""POINT"" contains N -> invalid.

 So words we can use: ""MOIST"", ""BUILD"", ""GHOUL"", ""SPLIT"", etc.

 Considering ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T -> these are all new and avoid banned letters.

 Similarly, ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> also good.

 Which word? ""SOUTH"" (S, O, U, T, H) is another candidate.

 I think ""MOIST"" and ""SPLIT"" are both strong because they have S and T which are very common.

 Let me pick ""MOIST"" for this guess.

 Alternatively, we can pick ""GHOUL"" but it has G, H, O, U, L which are less common and U is less frequent. But avoiding previously tried letters is necessary.

 Since ""MOIST"" uses 5 letters that are all high frequency and we haven't tried, it should be good.

 So, I'll guess ""MOIST"".After the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", we know that the letters **C, R, A, N, and E** are **not in the secret word**. Therefore, we need a new guess that avoids these letters entirely and tests new common letters.

High-value letters to try next include **O, I, S, T, M** (common vowels and consonants not yet tested). The word **""moist""** uses these letters and is a valid English 5-letter word. This guess will help gather new information about the secret word.

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as 'x', meaning none of these letters are in the secret word.
2. ""moist"": 
   - M: x (not in the word)
   - O: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, so the second letter of the secret word is O)
   - I: x (not in the word)
   - S: x (not in the word)
   - T: - (in the word but in the wrong position)

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the letter O in the second position: _ O _ _ _
- The secret word contains the letter T, but not in the last position (since in ""moist"" it was at the end and got a '-', meaning it's present but not at the end).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

Also, note that T is in the word but not at the end. Since the second position is O, T must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait, in ""moist"", T was in position 5 and got a '-', meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So T must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

However, we must avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has O as the second letter.
- Contains T, but not at the end (so not in position 5) and not in position 2 (which is O).
- Avoids the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

Possible positions for T: 1, 3, or 4.

We also need to choose other letters that are not in the excluded set. The available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and T, but we are using T once, and O is fixed at position 2).

We should try to cover more common letters to maximize information.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern: [letter1] O [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

With T being in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.

Option 1: T in position 1 -> T O _ _ _
Option 2: T in position 3 -> _ O T _ _
Option 3: T in position 4 -> _ O _ T _

We also know that the word must contain T and O (and O is fixed at position 2).

Let's consider common words:

For T in position 1: 
  - TOUCH? But C is excluded -> invalid.
  - TOUGH? G and H are allowed. Pattern: T O U G H -> but we have U, G, H. Also, we haven't tried U, G, H. So ""tough"" is a candidate.

For T in position 3:
  - _ O T _ _ : e.g., ""MOTEL"" -> but M and E are excluded. 
  - ""POTTY"" -> P, O, T, T, Y -> but T is repeated? And we don't know if T is repeated. Also, Y is allowed. However, we have two T's? The feedback for ""moist"" had only one T and it was marked as present. But the secret word might have two T's? We don't know. But in ""moist"" we only had one T, and it was marked as present, so at least one T. But the word could have more.

But we must avoid S, which is in ""potty""? No, ""potty"" has no S. But we have to check the letters: P, O, T, T, Y. Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S -> none of these, so it's allowed. However, we have two T's. But the feedback for ""moist"" only told us about one T? Actually, the feedback per letter: in ""moist"", the T was at the end and marked as present. If the word had two T's, we might have gotten more feedback? But in ""moist"" we only provided one T, so we don't know about duplicates. So ""potty"" is a possibility.

But let's look for more common words.

Another option for T in position 3: ""BOTCH"" -> but C is excluded. ""DOTTY"" -> D, O, T, T, Y -> again, two T's.

For T in position 4: _ O _ T _
  - e.g., ""FORTY"" -> but F, O, R, T, Y -> R is excluded (from first guess: R was x). So invalid.
  - ""POUTY"" -> P, O, U, T, Y -> no excluded letters? P, O, U, T, Y: O is fixed, P, U, T, Y are allowed. So ""pouty"" is a candidate.

But note: we have T in position 4. And in ""moist"", T was at position 5 and was marked as present but wrong position. So if T is at position 4 in the secret word, then in ""moist"" (which had T at position 5) we would get a '-' for T, which we did. So that matches.

Now, we have two strong candidates: 
  - ""tough"" (T at position 1)
  - ""pouty"" (T at position 4)

But we also have the option of T at position 3, e.g., ""potty"", but that has two T's. We don't know if the word has two T's, so we might get less information if we guess a word with duplicate letters. It's better to avoid duplicates to cover more letters.

So let's avoid duplicates for now.

Therefore, ""tough"" and ""pouty"" both have unique letters.

""tough"": T, O, U, G, H -> letters: T, O, U, G, H. We know O is fixed at position 2. So the word is T O U G H.

""pouty"": P, O, U, T, Y -> P, O, U, T, Y. Pattern: P O U T Y.

Which one to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible.

We have not tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Both words use U. ""tough"" uses T, U, G, H. ""pouty"" uses P, U, T, Y.

We already know T is in the word, so we don't need to test T again? But we are including T to confirm its position. However, we are forced to include T because we know it's in the word.

But we can choose a word that doesn't have T? No, because we must include T? Actually, we don't have to, but we know T is in the word, so if we don't include T, we might not get information about its position. But we are trying to find the word, so we should use the information we have.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T and also other new letters.

But both words are valid.

Another idea: we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has O, and we haven't tried U (which is a vowel). Both words have U.

But we also know that the word does not have A, E, I (from previous feedback). So the only vowels left are O (which we have) and U. So the word might have U.

We can also consider words without U? But we don't have to.

Let's list more words without duplicates and without excluded letters:

Pattern: _ O _ _ _

With T in the word, but not at position 2 or 5? Actually, in the feedback for ""moist"", T was at position 5 and got a '-', meaning T is in the word but not at position 5. So T can be at 1, 3, or 4.

Words with T at 1: 
  - TOUCH (invalid: C)
  - TOUGH (valid: T, O, U, G, H)
  - TOUR? (5 letters? no, tour is 4)
  - TOUTS (invalid: S) -> S is excluded.
  - TOUZY? (not common, and Z and Y are less common)

Words with T at 3:
  - _ O T _ _ : 
      - BOTCH (invalid: C)
      - DOTAL (invalid: A) -> A is excluded.
      - DOTED (invalid: E and D? D is allowed, but E is excluded) -> E is excluded.
      - GOTHS (invalid: S) -> S excluded.
      - LOTTE (invalid: E) -> E excluded.
      - MOTHS (invalid: M and S) -> M and S excluded.
      - NOTCH (invalid: N and C) -> N and C excluded.
      - POTTY (valid, but duplicate T) -> we avoid duplicates for now.
      - ROTCH (invalid: R and C) -> R excluded.
      - WOT? (not 5 letters)

  So few options without duplicates? Actually, ""POTTY"" is one, but duplicates.

Words with T at 4:
  - _ O _ T _ :
      - FORTH (invalid: R) -> R excluded.
      - FORTY (invalid: R) -> R excluded.
      - POUTY (valid: P, O, U, T, Y) -> no duplicates, and no excluded letters.
      - DOUTY? (not common, but D, O, U, T, Y -> valid, but we prefer common words)
      - GOUTY (valid: G, O, U, T, Y) -> same as pouty but with G instead of P.

So we have:
  - TOUGH (T at 1)
  - POUTY (T at 4)
  - GOUTY (T at 4) 

We can also consider other words without T? But we know T is in the word, so we should include it to get position information.

But we don't have to include T in every guess? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient. Since we know T is in the word, we can try to find its position.

Given that, let's choose between ""tough"" and ""pouty"".

We want to cover more new letters. 
- ""tough"": uses T, O, U, G, H -> new letters: U, G, H (T and O we already know about, but O is fixed and T is known to be present).
- ""pouty"": uses P, O, U, T, Y -> new letters: P, U, Y.

We haven't tried U, G, H, P, Y. Both are good.

But note: we have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We want to maximize information.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have T? But that might not help us locate T. However, if we don't include T, we might not get information about its position, but we can test other letters. But we know T is in the word, so we can use that to our advantage by including it.

But let me think: we can also try to use a word that has T in a different position than we are considering? We are considering positions 1,3,4. We can test T in position 3, for example, without duplicates.

But we couldn't find a common word without duplicates for T in position 3. So let's stick with T in position 1 or 4.

Another candidate: ""DOUBT"" -> D, O, U, B, T. Pattern: D O U B T. 
- This has T at the end? But in the feedback for ""moist"", T was at the end and got a '-', meaning T is not at position 5. So if we put T at position 5 again, we know it will be wrong. But we are trying to find the position of T. So ""doubt"" has T at position 5, which we know is incorrect. So that would be a waste? Because we know T is not at position 5, so we shouldn't put it there.

Therefore, we must avoid putting T at position 5.

So ""doubt"" is invalid because it places T at position 5, which we know is wrong.

Similarly, we must avoid putting T at position 2 because that is O.

So we are left with positions 1, 3, 4.

Now, let's choose between ""tough"" and ""pouty"". Both are valid and common.

We can also consider ""BOUGH"" (B, O, U, G, H) -> but this does not contain T. We know T is in the word, so if we guess ""bough"", we might not get information about T. However, we can still use it to test other letters.

But if we guess ""bough"", and the secret word has T, then we will get feedback that we are missing T? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. So if we guess ""bough"", we will get:
  - B: ? 
  - O: ✓ (fixed at position 2)
  - U: ? 
  - G: ? 
  - H: ?

And we won't get any information about T because we didn't guess it. But we already know T is in the word, so we don't need to confirm that. However, we don't know the position of T. So if we don't include T, we won't learn where it is.

Therefore, it's better to include T in our guess to narrow down its position.

So we go back to including T.

Now, between ""tough"" and ""pouty"", which one? 

We can also consider ""GOUTY"" (G, O, U, T, Y) which is similar to ""pouty"" but with G instead of P.

But let's pick one that uses more common consonants. 

I think ""tough"" is a good choice because it uses G and H, which are common.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position we are unsure about. We have two possibilities: T at 1 or T at 4 (or 3, but we don't have a good word without duplicates). 

We can try to test T at position 1 with ""tough"". If the feedback shows T as ✓, then we know T is at position 1. If not, then T must be at position 3 or 4. But if we get T as 'x', that would be a problem because we know T is in the word. But in ""tough"", T is at position 1, so if the secret word has T at position 1, we get ✓. If T is at position 3 or 4, then we would get T as '-' (because it's in the word but not at position 1). But we know T is in the word, so it cannot be 'x'. So we will either get ✓ or '-'.

Similarly, if we choose ""pouty"", T is at position 4. Then we will get either ✓ (if T is at position 4) or '-' (if T is at position 1 or 3).

So both are valid.

But note: if we choose ""tough"" and T is not at position 1, we get T as '-', and we still don't know if it's at 3 or 4. Similarly, if we choose ""pouty"" and T is not at 4, we get T as '-' and we don't know if it's at 1 or 3.

So we might need another guess to disambiguate.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in position 3? But we don't have a common word without duplicates. 

What about ""BOUTS""? But S is excluded. Invalid.

""DOUTT""? Not a word.

""LOUTY""? Not common, but L, O, U, T, Y -> valid? But ""louty"" is not a common word. We should stick to common words.

Another idea: ""THUMB"" -> T, H, U, M, B -> but M is excluded (from ""moist"" feedback: M was x). So invalid.

""LOTUS"" -> L, O, T, U, S -> but S is excluded. Invalid.

So we are limited.

Therefore, I think we should go with ""tough"" or ""pouty"". Let's choose ""tough"" because it uses G and H, which are common.

So guess: ""tough""

But let me check: the pattern is T O U G H.

We know O is at position 2, so that's fixed.

If the secret word is ""tough"", we get it right. Otherwise, we get feedback.

But the secret word might be something else, like ""pouty"" or ""gouty"", but we are guessing ""tough"".

We are on the third guess, so we have room.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't fix T to one position but tests multiple possibilities? But that's hard.

Another candidate: ""PUTTY"" -> but duplicate T and we avoid duplicates.

I think ""tough"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with ""tough"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E not in the word).
- ""moist"" showed:
  - O is correct and in position 2 (so the secret word is `_ O _ _ _`).
  - T is in the word but not in position 5 (since it received `-`).
  - M, I, S are not in the word.

The secret word must:
- Have O as the second letter.
- Contain T, but not in position 5 (positions 1, 3, or 4 are possible).
- Exclude C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

For the next guess, ""tough"" is chosen because:
- It tests T in position 1 (to check if T is in position 1).
- It uses new common letters (U, G, H) to gather more information.
- It avoids all excluded letters and fits the pattern `_ O _ _ _`.

""moist"": \n   - M: x (not in the word)\n   - O: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, so the second letter of the secret word is O)\n   - I: x (not in the word)\n   - S: x (not in the word)\n   - T: - (in the word but in the wrong position)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word has the letter O in the second position: _ O _ _ _\n- The secret word contains the letter T, but not in the last position (since in ""moist"" it was at the end and got a \'-\', meaning it\'s present but not at the end).\n- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.\n\nAlso, note that T is in the word but not at the end. Since the second position is O, T must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait, in ""moist"", T was in position 5 and got a \'-\', meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So T must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nHowever, we must avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Has O as the second letter.\n- Contains T, but not at the end (so not in position 5) and not in position 2 (which is O).\n- Avoids the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.\n\nPossible positions for T: 1, 3, or 4.\n\nWe also need to choose other letters that are not in the excluded set. The available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and T, but we are using T once, and O is fixed at position 2).\n\nWe should try to cover more common letters to maximize information.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit the pattern: [letter1] O [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]\n\nWith T being in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.\n\nOption 1: T in position 1 -> T O _ _ _\nOption 2: T in position 3 -> _ O T _ _\nOption 3: T in position 4 -> _ O _ T _\n\nWe also know that the word must contain T and O (and O is fixed at position 2).\n\nLet\'s consider common words:\n\nFor T in position 1: \n  - TOUCH? But C is excluded -> invalid.\n  - TOUGH? G and H are allowed. Pattern: T O U G H -> but we have U, G, H. Also, we haven\'t tried U, G, H. So ""tough"" is a candidate.\n\nFor T in position 3:\n  - _ O T _ _ : e.g., ""MOTEL"" -> but M and E are excluded. \n  - ""POTTY"" -> P, O, T, T, Y -> but T is repeated? And we don\'t know if T is repeated. Also, Y is allowed. However, we have two T\'s? The feedback for ""moist"" had only one T and it was marked as present. But the secret word might have two T\'s? We don\'t know. But in ""moist"" we only had one T, and it was marked as present, so at least one T. But the word could have more.\n\nBut we must avoid S, which is in ""potty""? No, ""potty"" has no S. But we have to check the letters: P, O, T, T, Y. Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S -> none of these, so it\'s allowed. However, we have two T\'s. But the feedback for ""moist"" only told us about one T? Actually, the feedback per letter: in ""moist"", the T was at the end and marked as present. If the word had two T\'s, we might have gotten more feedback? But in ""moist"" we only provided one T, so we don\'t know about duplicates. So ""potty"" is a possibility.\n\nBut let\'s look for more common words.\n\nAnother option for T in position 3: ""BOTCH"" -> but C is excluded. ""DOTTY"" -> D, O, T, T, Y -> again, two T\'s.\n\nFor T in position 4: _ O _ T _\n  - e.g., ""FORTY"" -> but F, O, R, T, Y -> R is excluded (from first guess: R was x). So invalid.\n  - ""POUTY"" -> P, O, U, T, Y -> no excluded letters? P, O, U, T, Y: O is fixed, P, U, T, Y are allowed. So ""pouty"" is a candidate.\n\nBut note: we have T in position 4. And in ""moist"", T was at position 5 and was marked as present but wrong position. So if T is at position 4 in the secret word, then in ""moist"" (which had T at position 5) we would get a \'-\' for T, which we did. So that matches.\n\nNow, we have two strong candidates: \n  - ""tough"" (T at position 1)\n  - ""pouty"" (T at position 4)\n\nBut we also have the option of T at position 3, e.g., ""potty"", but that has two T\'s. We don\'t know if the word has two T\'s, so we might get less information if we guess a word with duplicate letters. It\'s better to avoid duplicates to cover more letters.\n\nSo let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\nTherefore, ""tough"" and ""pouty"" both have unique letters.\n\n""tough"": T, O, U, G, H -> letters: T, O, U, G, H. We know O is fixed at position 2. So the word is T O U G H.\n\n""pouty"": P, O, U, T, Y -> P, O, U, T, Y. Pattern: P O U T Y.\n\nWhich one to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nWe have not tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBoth words use U. ""tough"" uses T, U, G, H. ""pouty"" uses P, U, T, Y.\n\nWe already know T is in the word, so we don\'t need to test T again? But we are including T to confirm its position. However, we are forced to include T because we know it\'s in the word.\n\nBut we can choose a word that doesn\'t have T? No, because we must include T? Actually, we don\'t have to, but we know T is in the word, so if we don\'t include T, we might not get information about its position. But we are trying to find the word, so we should use the information we have.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has T and also other new letters.\n\nBut both words are valid.\n\nAnother idea: we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has O, and we haven\'t tried U (which is a vowel). Both words have U.\n\nBut we also know that the word does not have A, E, I (from previous feedback). So the only vowels left are O (which we have) and U. So the word might have U.\n\nWe can also consider words without U? But we don\'t have to.\n\nLet\'s list more words without duplicates and without excluded letters:\n\nPattern: _ O _ _ _\n\nWith T in the word, but not at position 2 or 5? Actually, in the feedback for ""moist"", T was at position 5 and got a \'-\', meaning T is in the word but not at position 5. So T can be at 1, 3, or 4.\n\nWords with T at 1: \n  - TOUCH (invalid: C)\n  - TOUGH (valid: T, O, U, G, H)\n  - TOUR? (5 letters? no, tour is 4)\n  - TOUTS (invalid: S) -> S is excluded.\n  - TOUZY? (not common, and Z and Y are less common)\n\nWords with T at 3:\n  - _ O T _ _ : \n      - BOTCH (invalid: C)\n      - DOTAL (invalid: A) -> A is excluded.\n      - DOTED (invalid: E and D? D is allowed, but E is excluded) -> E is excluded.\n      - GOTHS (invalid: S) -> S excluded.\n      - LOTTE (invalid: E) -> E excluded.\n      - MOTHS (invalid: M and S) -> M and S excluded.\n      - NOTCH (invalid: N and C) -> N and C excluded.\n      - POTTY (valid, but duplicate T) -> we avoid duplicates for now.\n      - ROTCH (invalid: R and C) -> R excluded.\n      - WOT? (not 5 letters)\n\n  So few options without duplicates? Actually, ""POTTY"" is one, but duplicates.\n\nWords with T at 4:\n  - _ O _ T _ :\n      - FORTH (invalid: R) -> R excluded.\n      - FORTY (invalid: R) -> R excluded.\n      - POUTY (valid: P, O, U, T, Y) -> no duplicates, and no excluded letters.\n      - DOUTY? (not common, but D, O, U, T, Y -> valid, but we prefer common words)\n      - GOUTY (valid: G, O, U, T, Y) -> same as pouty but with G instead of P.\n\nSo we have:\n  - TOUGH (T at 1)\n  - POUTY (T at 4)\n  - GOUTY (T at 4) \n\nWe can also consider other words without T? But we know T is in the word, so we should include it to get position information.\n\nBut we don\'t have to include T in every guess? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient. Since we know T is in the word, we can try to find its position.\n\nGiven that, let\'s choose between ""tough"" and ""pouty"".\n\nWe want to cover more new letters. \n- ""tough"": uses T, O, U, G, H -> new letters: U, G, H (T and O we already know about, but O is fixed and T is known to be present).\n- ""pouty"": uses P, O, U, T, Y -> new letters: P, U, Y.\n\nWe haven\'t tried U, G, H, P, Y. Both are good.\n\nBut note: we have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We want to maximize information.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have T? But that might not help us locate T. However, if we don\'t include T, we might not get information about its position, but we can test other letters. But we know T is in the word, so we can use that to our advantage by including it.\n\nBut let me think: we can also try to use a word that has T in a different position than we are considering? We are considering positions 1,3,4. We can test T in position 3, for example, without duplicates.\n\nBut we couldn\'t find a common word without duplicates for T in position 3. So let\'s stick with T in position 1 or 4.\n\nAnother candidate: ""DOUBT"" -> D, O, U, B, T. Pattern: D O U B T. \n- This has T at the end? But in the feedback for ""moist"", T was at the end and got a \'-\', meaning T is not at position 5. So if we put T at position 5 again, we know it will be wrong. But we are trying to find the position of T. So ""doubt"" has T at position 5, which we know is incorrect. So that would be a waste? Because we know T is not at position 5, so we shouldn\'t put it there.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid putting T at position 5.\n\nSo ""doubt"" is invalid because it places T at position 5, which we know is wrong.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid putting T at position 2 because that is O.\n\nSo we are left with positions 1, 3, 4.\n\nNow, let\'s choose between ""tough"" and ""pouty"". Both are valid and common.\n\nWe can also consider ""BOUGH"" (B, O, U, G, H) -> but this does not contain T. We know T is in the word, so if we guess ""bough"", we might not get information about T. However, we can still use it to test other letters.\n\nBut if we guess ""bough"", and the secret word has T, then we will get feedback that we are missing T? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. So if we guess ""bough"", we will get:\n  - B: ? \n  - O: ✓ (fixed at position 2)\n  - U: ? \n  - G: ? \n  - H: ?\n\nAnd we won\'t get any information about T because we didn\'t guess it. But we already know T is in the word, so we don\'t need to confirm that. However, we don\'t know the position of T. So if we don\'t include T, we won\'t learn where it is.\n\nTherefore, it\'s better to include T in our guess to narrow down its position.\n\nSo we go back to including T.\n\nNow, between ""tough"" and ""pouty"", which one? \n\nWe can also consider ""GOUTY"" (G, O, U, T, Y) which is similar to ""pouty"" but with G instead of P.\n\nBut let\'s pick one that uses more common consonants. \n\nI think ""tough"" is a good choice because it uses G and H, which are common.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position we are unsure about. We have two possibilities: T at 1 or T at 4 (or 3, but we don\'t have a good word without duplicates). \n\nWe can try to test T at position 1 with ""tough"". If the feedback shows T as ✓, then we know T is at position 1. If not, then T must be at position 3 or 4. But if we get T as \'x\', that would be a problem because we know T is in the word. But in ""tough"", T is at position 1, so if the secret word has T at position 1, we get ✓. If T is at position 3 or 4, then we would get T as \'-\' (because it\'s in the word but not at position 1). But we know T is in the word, so it cannot be \'x\'. So we will either get ✓ or \'-\'.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose ""pouty"", T is at position 4. Then we will get either ✓ (if T is at position 4) or \'-\' (if T is at position 1 or 3).\n\nSo both are valid.\n\nBut note: if we choose ""tough"" and T is not at position 1, we get T as \'-\', and we still don\'t know if it\'s at 3 or 4. Similarly, if we choose ""pouty"" and T is not at 4, we get T as \'-\' and we don\'t know if it\'s at 1 or 3.\n\nSo we might need another guess to disambiguate.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has T in position 3? But we don\'t have a common word without duplicates. \n\nWhat about ""BOUTS""? But S is excluded. Invalid.\n\n""DOUTT""? Not a word.\n\n""LOUTY""? Not common, but L, O, U, T, Y -> valid? But ""louty"" is not a common word. We should stick to common words.\n\nAnother idea: ""THUMB"" -> T, H, U, M, B -> but M is excluded (from ""moist"" feedback: M was x). So invalid.\n\n""LOTUS"" -> L, O, T, U, S -> but S is excluded. Invalid.\n\nSo we are limited.\n\nTherefore, I think we should go with ""tough"" or ""pouty"". Let\'s choose ""tough"" because it uses G and H, which are common.\n\nSo guess: ""tough""\n\nBut let me check: the pattern is T O U G H.\n\nWe know O is at position 2, so that\'s fixed.\n\nIf the secret word is ""tough"", we get it right. Otherwise, we get feedback.\n\nBut the secret word might be something else, like ""pouty"" or ""gouty"", but we are guessing ""tough"".\n\nWe are on the third guess, so we have room.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t fix T to one position but tests multiple possibilities? But that\'s hard.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PUTTY"" -> but duplicate T and we avoid duplicates.\n\nI think ""tough"" is a good choice.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""tough"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E not in the word).\n- ""moist"" showed:\n  - O is correct and in position 2 (so the secret word is `_ O _ _ _`).\n  - T is in the word but not in position 5 (since it received `-`).\n  - M, I, S are not in the word.\n\nThe secret word must:\n- Have O as the second letter.\n- Contain T, but not in position 5 (positions 1, 3, or 4 are possible).\n- Exclude C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.\n\nFor the next guess, ""tough"" is chosen because:\n- It tests T in position 1 (to check if T is in position 1).\n- It uses new common letters (U, G, H) to gather more information.\n- It avoids all excluded letters and fits the pattern `_ O _ _ _`.\n\n<guess>tough</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)\nGuess 3: tough -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(✓) U(x) G(x) H(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

1. **crane**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these.
2. **moist**: 
   - M: absent (x)
   - O: correct and in position (✓) — so the second letter is O.
   - I: absent (x)
   - S: absent (x)
   - T: present but wrong position (-) — so T is in the word, but not at position 5.
3. **tough**:
   - T: present but wrong position (-) — so T is in the word, but not at position 1 (since we guessed it at position 1 and got '-'). 
   - O: correct and in position (✓) — confirms second letter is O.
   - U: absent (x) — not in the word.
   - G: absent (x) — not in the word.
   - H: absent (x) — not in the word.

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ O _ _ _
- The word contains the letter T, but not in position 1 or 5 (from ""moist"" and ""tough"").
- Therefore, T must be in position 3 or 4.

Additionally, the following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, U, G, H.

We need to avoid these letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, M, N, R, S, U.

Available letters: B, D, F, K, L, O, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. (Note: O is fixed at position 2, and T is in the word at position 3 or 4.)

The secret word pattern: [letter1] O [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

With T in position 3 or 4.

We must form a word with the available letters and the constraints.

Let's consider the two cases:

**Case 1: T in position 3**
Pattern: _ O T _ _

The word would be: ? O T ? ?

We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with letters from the available set (B, D, F, K, L, P, V, W, X, Y, Z) and avoid the excluded letters.

Possible words:
- BOT??
  - We need two more letters. But note: we have excluded many letters. 
  - Example: BOTHY? But H is excluded. 
  - BOTTY? But T is repeated? And Y is allowed. However, we don't know if T is repeated. But in previous feedback, we only know one T is present. But the word could have two T's? We have to consider.

But let's think of common words:
- ""BOTTY"" is not a common word. 
- ""DOTTY"" has D, O, T, T, Y -> but T is repeated and we have D and Y. However, D is allowed. But is ""dotty"" valid? Yes, but let's see if we can avoid duplicates for more information.

Alternatively, without duplicate T:
- ""DOTED"" -> but E and D? E is excluded. 
- ""BOTEL"" -> E is excluded? And L is allowed, but E is in ""botel""? Actually, ""botel"" is not common; we use ""hotel"" but H is excluded.

Another idea: ""LOTTE"" -> E excluded.

It's hard to find a word without duplicates and without excluded letters.

**Case 2: T in position 4**
Pattern: _ O _ T _

The word would be: ? O ? T ?

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with available letters.

Possible words:
- P O ? T Y -> ""POUTY"" (P, O, U, T, Y) but U is excluded (from ""tough"" feedback: U was x). So invalid.
- G O ? T Y -> ""GOUTY"" (G, O, U, T, Y) but U is excluded and G is excluded (from ""tough"": G was x). So invalid.
- F O ? T ? -> e.g., ""FORTY"" but R is excluded (from ""crane"": R was x). 
- W O ? T ? -> ""WOMAN"" but M and A are excluded? A and M are excluded. 
- ""VOLTY""? Not a word.

What about ""BOOTY""? But that has two O's? Pattern: B O O T Y -> but we have O at position 2, and if we put O at position 3, that would be a duplicate O. But we don't know if O is duplicated? The feedback for ""moist"" had O at position 2 and it was correct, but we don't know about other positions. However, in ""moist"", we only had one O, so we don't know.

But ""BOOTY"": B, O, O, T, Y. 
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 3: O (which is a duplicate)
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: Y

But we have to check if O can be duplicated? The feedback doesn't say anything against duplicates. So it's possible.

But we have to avoid excluded letters: B is allowed, O is allowed (but we know it's in the word), T is allowed, Y is allowed. And no excluded letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, M, N, R, S, U are excluded. So ""BOOTY"" is a candidate.

But note: in ""moist"", we had O at position 2 and it was correct. If the word has another O, we don't know. But in ""booty"", we have O at position 3. So if we guess ""booty"", we can get information about that.

Another candidate: ""DOZTY""? Not a word.

""POOTY""? Not common.

""TOWZY""? Not common.

But ""BOOTY"" is a common word.

Alternatively, ""LOOTY""? Not common.

Another idea: ""BOWAT""? Not a word.

Given the constraints, ""BOOTY"" seems a valid candidate.

But let's check the T position: in ""BOOTY"", T is at position 4. And we know T must be in position 3 or 4, so position 4 is possible.

Also, we have not tried B, O (duplicate), T, Y. We know O is in the word, but we don't know about duplicate O. We know T is in the word. B and Y are new.

But we have to consider: if the secret word has duplicate O, that's fine. But we are testing it.

Another candidate: ""BOLTY""? Not a word.

""BOTFLY""? 6 letters.

So ""BOOTY"" is a possibility.

But we also have the case for T in position 3. We need to cover that as well.

We can try a word that has T in position 3 and uses available letters.

For example, ""LOTAS""? Not a word, and S excluded.

""KOTOW""? K, O, T, O, W -> but duplicate O? Pattern: K O T O W. This has T at position 3. And letters: K, O, T, O, W. Excluded letters? K is allowed, O is known, T is known, W is allowed. And no excluded letters. ""Kotow"" is a word (variant of kowtow, but it can be 5 letters? Kotow is accepted as a word in some dictionaries).

But let's see: ""kotow"" means to bow, and it's valid.

So we have two candidates for the two cases:
- For T in position 3: ""KOTOW"" (K O T O W)
- For T in position 4: ""BOOTY"" (B O O T Y)

But we don't know which case is true. We need to choose one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't assume T's position but tests multiple possibilities? But that might be hard.

We know T is in position 3 or 4. We can choose a word that has T in position 3 and also tests other letters, or in position 4.

But we have to pick one.

We can also consider: we have not tried many letters. We should try to cover more new letters.

In ""BOOTY"": new letters are B, O (duplicate), T (known), Y. But we are testing duplicate O and T at position 4.

In ""KOTOW"": new letters K, O (duplicate), T (known), W. Testing T at position 3 and duplicate O.

But note: we are on the fourth guess. We have 3 guesses left (since we started with 6).

We can also consider a word that doesn't have T? But we know T is in the word, so we should use that. However, if we don't include T, we might not get information about its position, but we can test other letters. But we are limited on guesses.

But let's think: if we guess a word without T, and it turns out T is in the word (which it is), we won't get any new info on T. So it's better to include T to resolve its position.

So we have to choose between T in position 3 or 4.

How to decide? We can look at frequency or just pick one.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has T in position 3 and also has a letter that can be in position 4 or 5 to cover more ground.

But let's list all possible words that fit.

Given the constraints, the possible words might be few.

We can try:

- T in position 3: words like ? O T ? ? with available letters: B, D, F, K, L, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but T is at 3, so for other positions: 1,4,5)

  - B O T ? ? -> BOTCH (C,H excluded), BOTHY (H excluded), BOTTY (duplicate T, but allowed? and Y -> ""botty"" is not common)
  - D O T ? ? -> DOTED (E excluded), DOTTY (duplicate T, Y)
  - F O T ? ? -> FOTCH? not a word
  - K O T ? ? -> KOTOW (K O T O W) -> valid
  - L O T ? ? -> LOTAS (S excluded), LOTTE (E excluded), LOTTO (duplicate T, O) -> ""lotto"" is valid, but O is duplicate and T duplicate? Pattern: L O T T O. But we have O at position 2 and 5? And T at 3 and 4? But we know T is in the word, but we don't know about duplicates. ""LOTTO"" has two T's and two O's. But we are avoiding duplicates? We can try, but it might not be efficient.

- T in position 4: ? O ? T ? 
  - B O ? T Y -> ""BOOTY"" (B O O T Y) or ""BORTY"" (but R excluded), ""BOTTY"" (T duplicate, but if we put T at 4 and 5? ""BOTTY"" has T at 3 and 4? No, ""botty"" is B O T T Y, so T at 3 and 4. But we are considering T at 4 only? In this case, for position 4, we want T at 4, so the word is ? O ? T Y. For example, ""BOOTY"" has O at 3 and T at 4. Or ""POUTY"" but U excluded. 
  - D O ? T Y -> ""DOTTY"" has T at 3 and 4, not at 4 alone. ""DOWTY""? Not a word.
  - F O ? T Y -> ""FORTY"" R excluded.
  - K O ? T Y -> ""KOTY""? Not 5 letters.
  - L O ? T Y -> ""LOTTY"" has T at 3 and 4? ""LOTTY"" is L O T T Y -> T at 3 and 4. But we want T only at 4? Then we need a word with no T at 3. For example, ""LOFTY"" -> L, O, F, T, Y. But F is allowed. Pattern: L O F T Y. This has T at position 4. And no duplicate T. And letters: L, O, F, T, Y. All allowed? Excluded letters: none of the excluded. So ""LOFTY"" is a valid word.

Oh! ""LOFTY"" is a great candidate for T in position 4.

Similarly, for T in position 3, we have ""KOTOW"".

But ""LOFTY"" has T at position 4, which is one of the possibilities.

And it uses new letters: L, F, T, Y (O is fixed).

So let's consider ""LOFTY"".

Pattern: L O F T Y

- Position 1: L
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 3: F
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: Y

This avoids all excluded letters and tests T at position 4.

If T is indeed at position 4, we might get T as correct. If not, then T must be at position 3.

Moreover, we test L, F, and Y.

So this seems a good guess.

Similarly, we could test T at position 3 with a word like ""KOTOW"", but ""LOFTY"" uses more common letters? F and L are common.

But let's compare:

- ""LOFTY"": tests L, F, T, Y (and O)
- ""KOTOW"": tests K, T, O (duplicate), W

We have not tried L, F, Y, K, W. Both are good.

But ""LOFTY"" is a more common word.

Also, if we guess ""LOFTY"" and T is not at position 4, we know T must be at position 3, and we can focus on that in the next guess.

Similarly, if we get feedback that T is at position 4, then we might be close to the word.

So I think ""LOFTY"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""LOFTY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are not in the word.
- **Guess 2 (moist)**:
  - O is correct and in position 2 (✓), confirming the pattern `_ O _ _ _`.
  - T is present but in the wrong position (-), so T is in the word but not at position 5.
  - M, I, S are absent (x).
- **Guess 3 (tough)**:
  - T is present but in the wrong position (-), so T is not at position 1 (and not at position 5, from Guess 2).
  - O is correct and in position 2 (✓), reaffirming the pattern.
  - U, G, H are absent (x).

### Key Insights:
- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ O _ _ _` (O is the second letter).
- **T Position**: T must be in position 3 or 4 (since it cannot be in 1, 2, or 5).
- **Absent Letters**: A, C, E, G, H, I, M, N, R, S, U (cannot be in the word).
- **Available Letters**: B, D, F, K, L, O, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (O and T are confirmed in the word).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test T in position 4 (since position 3 is also possible, but we need to resolve T's location).
- Use new high-frequency letters (e.g., L, F, Y) to maximize information.
- Avoid absent letters and ensure the word fits the pattern `_ O _ T _` (for T in position 4).

**Chosen Guess: LOFTY**  
- **Why?**  
  - Tests T in position 4: If T is correct (✓), we lock in position 4. If T is present but wrong position (-), it must be in position 3.  
  - Tests new letters: L (position 1), F (position 3), Y (position 5).  
  - Avoids all absent letters and uses common consonants/vowels.  
  - Valid English word (meaning ""high or elevated"").  

<guess>lofty</guess>",lofty,"We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

1. **crane**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these.
2. **moist**: 
   - M: absent (x)
   - O: correct and in position (✓) — so the second letter is O.
   - I: absent (x)
   - S: absent (x)
   - T: present but wrong position (-) — so T is in the word, but not at position 5.
3. **tough**:
   - T: present but wrong position (-) — so T is in the word, but not at position 1 (since we guessed it at position 1 and got '-'). 
   - O: correct and in position (✓) — confirms second letter is O.
   - U: absent (x) — not in the word.
   - G: absent (x) — not in the word.
   - H: absent (x) — not in the word.

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ O _ _ _
- The word contains the letter T, but not in position 1 or 5 (from ""moist"" and ""tough"").
- Therefore, T must be in position 3 or 4.

Additionally, the following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, U, G, H.

We need to avoid these letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, M, N, R, S, U.

Available letters: B, D, F, K, L, O, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. (Note: O is fixed at position 2, and T is in the word at position 3 or 4.)

The secret word pattern: [letter1] O [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

With T in position 3 or 4.

We must form a word with the available letters and the constraints.

Let's consider the two cases:

**Case 1: T in position 3**
Pattern: _ O T _ _

The word would be: ? O T ? ?

We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with letters from the available set (B, D, F, K, L, P, V, W, X, Y, Z) and avoid the excluded letters.

Possible words:
- BOT??
  - We need two more letters. But note: we have excluded many letters. 
  - Example: BOTHY? But H is excluded. 
  - BOTTY? But T is repeated? And Y is allowed. However, we don't know if T is repeated. But in previous feedback, we only know one T is present. But the word could have two T's? We have to consider.

But let's think of common words:
- ""BOTTY"" is not a common word. 
- ""DOTTY"" has D, O, T, T, Y -> but T is repeated and we have D and Y. However, D is allowed. But is ""dotty"" valid? Yes, but let's see if we can avoid duplicates for more information.

Alternatively, without duplicate T:
- ""DOTED"" -> but E and D? E is excluded. 
- ""BOTEL"" -> E is excluded? And L is allowed, but E is in ""botel""? Actually, ""botel"" is not common; we use ""hotel"" but H is excluded.

Another idea: ""LOTTE"" -> E excluded.

It's hard to find a word without duplicates and without excluded letters.

**Case 2: T in position 4**
Pattern: _ O _ T _

The word would be: ? O ? T ?

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with available letters.

Possible words:
- P O ? T Y -> ""POUTY"" (P, O, U, T, Y) but U is excluded (from ""tough"" feedback: U was x). So invalid.
- G O ? T Y -> ""GOUTY"" (G, O, U, T, Y) but U is excluded and G is excluded (from ""tough"": G was x). So invalid.
- F O ? T ? -> e.g., ""FORTY"" but R is excluded (from ""crane"": R was x). 
- W O ? T ? -> ""WOMAN"" but M and A are excluded? A and M are excluded. 
- ""VOLTY""? Not a word.

What about ""BOOTY""? But that has two O's? Pattern: B O O T Y -> but we have O at position 2, and if we put O at position 3, that would be a duplicate O. But we don't know if O is duplicated? The feedback for ""moist"" had O at position 2 and it was correct, but we don't know about other positions. However, in ""moist"", we only had one O, so we don't know.

But ""BOOTY"": B, O, O, T, Y. 
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 3: O (which is a duplicate)
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: Y

But we have to check if O can be duplicated? The feedback doesn't say anything against duplicates. So it's possible.

But we have to avoid excluded letters: B is allowed, O is allowed (but we know it's in the word), T is allowed, Y is allowed. And no excluded letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, M, N, R, S, U are excluded. So ""BOOTY"" is a candidate.

But note: in ""moist"", we had O at position 2 and it was correct. If the word has another O, we don't know. But in ""booty"", we have O at position 3. So if we guess ""booty"", we can get information about that.

Another candidate: ""DOZTY""? Not a word.

""POOTY""? Not common.

""TOWZY""? Not common.

But ""BOOTY"" is a common word.

Alternatively, ""LOOTY""? Not common.

Another idea: ""BOWAT""? Not a word.

Given the constraints, ""BOOTY"" seems a valid candidate.

But let's check the T position: in ""BOOTY"", T is at position 4. And we know T must be in position 3 or 4, so position 4 is possible.

Also, we have not tried B, O (duplicate), T, Y. We know O is in the word, but we don't know about duplicate O. We know T is in the word. B and Y are new.

But we have to consider: if the secret word has duplicate O, that's fine. But we are testing it.

Another candidate: ""BOLTY""? Not a word.

""BOTFLY""? 6 letters.

So ""BOOTY"" is a possibility.

But we also have the case for T in position 3. We need to cover that as well.

We can try a word that has T in position 3 and uses available letters.

For example, ""LOTAS""? Not a word, and S excluded.

""KOTOW""? K, O, T, O, W -> but duplicate O? Pattern: K O T O W. This has T at position 3. And letters: K, O, T, O, W. Excluded letters? K is allowed, O is known, T is known, W is allowed. And no excluded letters. ""Kotow"" is a word (variant of kowtow, but it can be 5 letters? Kotow is accepted as a word in some dictionaries).

But let's see: ""kotow"" means to bow, and it's valid.

So we have two candidates for the two cases:
- For T in position 3: ""KOTOW"" (K O T O W)
- For T in position 4: ""BOOTY"" (B O O T Y)

But we don't know which case is true. We need to choose one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't assume T's position but tests multiple possibilities? But that might be hard.

We know T is in position 3 or 4. We can choose a word that has T in position 3 and also tests other letters, or in position 4.

But we have to pick one.

We can also consider: we have not tried many letters. We should try to cover more new letters.

In ""BOOTY"": new letters are B, O (duplicate), T (known), Y. But we are testing duplicate O and T at position 4.

In ""KOTOW"": new letters K, O (duplicate), T (known), W. Testing T at position 3 and duplicate O.

But note: we are on the fourth guess. We have 3 guesses left (since we started with 6).

We can also consider a word that doesn't have T? But we know T is in the word, so we should use that. However, if we don't include T, we might not get information about its position, but we can test other letters. But we are limited on guesses.

But let's think: if we guess a word without T, and it turns out T is in the word (which it is), we won't get any new info on T. So it's better to include T to resolve its position.

So we have to choose between T in position 3 or 4.

How to decide? We can look at frequency or just pick one.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has T in position 3 and also has a letter that can be in position 4 or 5 to cover more ground.

But let's list all possible words that fit.

Given the constraints, the possible words might be few.

We can try:

- T in position 3: words like ? O T ? ? with available letters: B, D, F, K, L, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but T is at 3, so for other positions: 1,4,5)

  - B O T ? ? -> BOTCH (C,H excluded), BOTHY (H excluded), BOTTY (duplicate T, but allowed? and Y -> ""botty"" is not common)
  - D O T ? ? -> DOTED (E excluded), DOTTY (duplicate T, Y)
  - F O T ? ? -> FOTCH? not a word
  - K O T ? ? -> KOTOW (K O T O W) -> valid
  - L O T ? ? -> LOTAS (S excluded), LOTTE (E excluded), LOTTO (duplicate T, O) -> ""lotto"" is valid, but O is duplicate and T duplicate? Pattern: L O T T O. But we have O at position 2 and 5? And T at 3 and 4? But we know T is in the word, but we don't know about duplicates. ""LOTTO"" has two T's and two O's. But we are avoiding duplicates? We can try, but it might not be efficient.

- T in position 4: ? O ? T ? 
  - B O ? T Y -> ""BOOTY"" (B O O T Y) or ""BORTY"" (but R excluded), ""BOTTY"" (T duplicate, but if we put T at 4 and 5? ""BOTTY"" has T at 3 and 4? No, ""botty"" is B O T T Y, so T at 3 and 4. But we are considering T at 4 only? In this case, for position 4, we want T at 4, so the word is ? O ? T Y. For example, ""BOOTY"" has O at 3 and T at 4. Or ""POUTY"" but U excluded. 
  - D O ? T Y -> ""DOTTY"" has T at 3 and 4, not at 4 alone. ""DOWTY""? Not a word.
  - F O ? T Y -> ""FORTY"" R excluded.
  - K O ? T Y -> ""KOTY""? Not 5 letters.
  - L O ? T Y -> ""LOTTY"" has T at 3 and 4? ""LOTTY"" is L O T T Y -> T at 3 and 4. But we want T only at 4? Then we need a word with no T at 3. For example, ""LOFTY"" -> L, O, F, T, Y. But F is allowed. Pattern: L O F T Y. This has T at position 4. And no duplicate T. And letters: L, O, F, T, Y. All allowed? Excluded letters: none of the excluded. So ""LOFTY"" is a valid word.

Oh! ""LOFTY"" is a great candidate for T in position 4.

Similarly, for T in position 3, we have ""KOTOW"".

But ""LOFTY"" has T at position 4, which is one of the possibilities.

And it uses new letters: L, F, T, Y (O is fixed).

So let's consider ""LOFTY"".

Pattern: L O F T Y

- Position 1: L
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 3: F
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: Y

This avoids all excluded letters and tests T at position 4.

If T is indeed at position 4, we might get T as correct. If not, then T must be at position 3.

Moreover, we test L, F, and Y.

So this seems a good guess.

Similarly, we could test T at position 3 with a word like ""KOTOW"", but ""LOFTY"" uses more common letters? F and L are common.

But let's compare:

- ""LOFTY"": tests L, F, T, Y (and O)
- ""KOTOW"": tests K, T, O (duplicate), W

We have not tried L, F, Y, K, W. Both are good.

But ""LOFTY"" is a more common word.

Also, if we guess ""LOFTY"" and T is not at position 4, we know T must be at position 3, and we can focus on that in the next guess.

Similarly, if we get feedback that T is at position 4, then we might be close to the word.

So I think ""LOFTY"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""LOFTY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are not in the word.
- **Guess 2 (moist)**:
  - O is correct and in position 2 (✓), confirming the pattern `_ O _ _ _`.
  - T is present but in the wrong position (-), so T is in the word but not at position 5.
  - M, I, S are absent (x).
- **Guess 3 (tough)**:
  - T is present but in the wrong position (-), so T is not at position 1 (and not at position 5, from Guess 2).
  - O is correct and in position 2 (✓), reaffirming the pattern.
  - U, G, H are absent (x).

### Key Insights:
- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ O _ _ _` (O is the second letter).
- **T Position**: T must be in position 3 or 4 (since it cannot be in 1, 2, or 5).
- **Absent Letters**: A, C, E, G, H, I, M, N, R, S, U (cannot be in the word).
- **Available Letters**: B, D, F, K, L, O, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (O and T are confirmed in the word).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test T in position 4 (since position 3 is also possible, but we need to resolve T's location).
- Use new high-frequency letters (e.g., L, F, Y) to maximize information.
- Avoid absent letters and ensure the word fits the pattern `_ O _ T _` (for T in position 4).

**Chosen Guess: LOFTY**  
- **Why?**  
  - Tests T in position 4: If T is correct (✓), we lock in position 4. If T is present but wrong position (-), it must be in position 3.  
  - Tests new letters: L (position 1), F (position 3), Y (position 5).  
  - Avoids all absent letters and uses common consonants/vowels.  
  - Valid English word (meaning ""high or elevated"").",Guess 4: lofty -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(✓) F(x) T(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word at all.
 Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of these five letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Since none of these letters are in the word, we must choose a new word that avoids all of these letters.

 We need to pick a word that uses entirely different letters. Also, we want to cover common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Common vowels that weren't in the first guess: I, O, U (we've tried A and E, now avoid them). Also, common consonants we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, L, M, P, S, T, etc.

 A good candidate might be a word like ""SPLIT"" or ""GHOUL"", but let me think of words that use high-frequency letters we haven't tried.

 Options:
   - We can try ""MOIST"": uses M, O, I, S, T -> all new letters.
   - Another option: ""PUDGY"" but less common.

 However, we must note that the word must be a valid English word.

 Alternatively, consider ""LIGHT"" (L, I, G, H, T) or ""POUND"" (P, O, U, N, D) but we know N is out from previous feedback? Actually, in the feedback N was x, meaning N is not in the word. But we are avoiding C, R, A, N, E.

 Since ""MOIST"" uses M, O, I, S, T and none of these C,R,A,N,E, it should be safe. Also, it's a common word.

 However, let's check frequency of letters:
   After removing C,R,A,N,E, high frequency letters are O, I, S, T, L, U, B, D, G, H, M, P.

 ""MOIST"" covers O, I, S, T, M. That's good.

 Alternatively ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D -> also good.

 But note: we have only 6 tries and we want maximum information. ""MOIST"" has two vowels (O,I) and three consonants, which is balanced.

 Another candidate: ""POINT"" (P, O, I, N, T) but N is already excluded? Wait, no: N was excluded, so N cannot be used. So ""POINT"" is invalid because it contains N? Let me see:
   Our first guess feedback said N(x), meaning there is no N. So we must avoid N.

 Therefore, ""POINT"" contains N -> invalid.

 So words we can use: ""MOIST"", ""BUILD"", ""GHOUL"", ""SPLIT"", etc.

 Considering ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T -> these are all new and avoid banned letters.

 Similarly, ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> also good.

 Which word? ""SOUTH"" (S, O, U, T, H) is another candidate.

 I think ""MOIST"" and ""SPLIT"" are both strong because they have S and T which are very common.

 Let me pick ""MOIST"" for this guess.

 Alternatively, we can pick ""GHOUL"" but it has G, H, O, U, L which are less common and U is less frequent. But avoiding previously tried letters is necessary.

 Since ""MOIST"" uses 5 letters that are all high frequency and we haven't tried, it should be good.

 So, I'll guess ""MOIST"".After the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", we know that the letters **C, R, A, N, and E** are **not in the secret word**. Therefore, we need a new guess that avoids these letters entirely and tests new common letters.

High-value letters to try next include **O, I, S, T, M** (common vowels and consonants not yet tested). The word **""moist""** uses these letters and is a valid English 5-letter word. This guess will help gather new information about the secret word.

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as 'x', meaning none of these letters are in the secret word.
2. ""moist"": 
   - M: x (not in the word)
   - O: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, so the second letter of the secret word is O)
   - I: x (not in the word)
   - S: x (not in the word)
   - T: - (in the word but in the wrong position)

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the letter O in the second position: _ O _ _ _
- The secret word contains the letter T, but not in the last position (since in ""moist"" it was at the end and got a '-', meaning it's present but not at the end).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

Also, note that T is in the word but not at the end. Since the second position is O, T must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait, in ""moist"", T was in position 5 and got a '-', meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So T must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

However, we must avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has O as the second letter.
- Contains T, but not at the end (so not in position 5) and not in position 2 (which is O).
- Avoids the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

Possible positions for T: 1, 3, or 4.

We also need to choose other letters that are not in the excluded set. The available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and T, but we are using T once, and O is fixed at position 2).

We should try to cover more common letters to maximize information.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern: [letter1] O [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

With T being in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.

Option 1: T in position 1 -> T O _ _ _
Option 2: T in position 3 -> _ O T _ _
Option 3: T in position 4 -> _ O _ T _

We also know that the word must contain T and O (and O is fixed at position 2).

Let's consider common words:

For T in position 1: 
  - TOUCH? But C is excluded -> invalid.
  - TOUGH? G and H are allowed. Pattern: T O U G H -> but we have U, G, H. Also, we haven't tried U, G, H. So ""tough"" is a candidate.

For T in position 3:
  - _ O T _ _ : e.g., ""MOTEL"" -> but M and E are excluded. 
  - ""POTTY"" -> P, O, T, T, Y -> but T is repeated? And we don't know if T is repeated. Also, Y is allowed. However, we have two T's? The feedback for ""moist"" had only one T and it was marked as present. But the secret word might have two T's? We don't know. But in ""moist"" we only had one T, and it was marked as present, so at least one T. But the word could have more.

But we must avoid S, which is in ""potty""? No, ""potty"" has no S. But we have to check the letters: P, O, T, T, Y. Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S -> none of these, so it's allowed. However, we have two T's. But the feedback for ""moist"" only told us about one T? Actually, the feedback per letter: in ""moist"", the T was at the end and marked as present. If the word had two T's, we might have gotten more feedback? But in ""moist"" we only provided one T, so we don't know about duplicates. So ""potty"" is a possibility.

But let's look for more common words.

Another option for T in position 3: ""BOTCH"" -> but C is excluded. ""DOTTY"" -> D, O, T, T, Y -> again, two T's.

For T in position 4: _ O _ T _
  - e.g., ""FORTY"" -> but F, O, R, T, Y -> R is excluded (from first guess: R was x). So invalid.
  - ""POUTY"" -> P, O, U, T, Y -> no excluded letters? P, O, U, T, Y: O is fixed, P, U, T, Y are allowed. So ""pouty"" is a candidate.

But note: we have T in position 4. And in ""moist"", T was at position 5 and was marked as present but wrong position. So if T is at position 4 in the secret word, then in ""moist"" (which had T at position 5) we would get a '-' for T, which we did. So that matches.

Now, we have two strong candidates: 
  - ""tough"" (T at position 1)
  - ""pouty"" (T at position 4)

But we also have the option of T at position 3, e.g., ""potty"", but that has two T's. We don't know if the word has two T's, so we might get less information if we guess a word with duplicate letters. It's better to avoid duplicates to cover more letters.

So let's avoid duplicates for now.

Therefore, ""tough"" and ""pouty"" both have unique letters.

""tough"": T, O, U, G, H -> letters: T, O, U, G, H. We know O is fixed at position 2. So the word is T O U G H.

""pouty"": P, O, U, T, Y -> P, O, U, T, Y. Pattern: P O U T Y.

Which one to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible.

We have not tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Both words use U. ""tough"" uses T, U, G, H. ""pouty"" uses P, U, T, Y.

We already know T is in the word, so we don't need to test T again? But we are including T to confirm its position. However, we are forced to include T because we know it's in the word.

But we can choose a word that doesn't have T? No, because we must include T? Actually, we don't have to, but we know T is in the word, so if we don't include T, we might not get information about its position. But we are trying to find the word, so we should use the information we have.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T and also other new letters.

But both words are valid.

Another idea: we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has O, and we haven't tried U (which is a vowel). Both words have U.

But we also know that the word does not have A, E, I (from previous feedback). So the only vowels left are O (which we have) and U. So the word might have U.

We can also consider words without U? But we don't have to.

Let's list more words without duplicates and without excluded letters:

Pattern: _ O _ _ _

With T in the word, but not at position 2 or 5? Actually, in the feedback for ""moist"", T was at position 5 and got a '-', meaning T is in the word but not at position 5. So T can be at 1, 3, or 4.

Words with T at 1: 
  - TOUCH (invalid: C)
  - TOUGH (valid: T, O, U, G, H)
  - TOUR? (5 letters? no, tour is 4)
  - TOUTS (invalid: S) -> S is excluded.
  - TOUZY? (not common, and Z and Y are less common)

Words with T at 3:
  - _ O T _ _ : 
      - BOTCH (invalid: C)
      - DOTAL (invalid: A) -> A is excluded.
      - DOTED (invalid: E and D? D is allowed, but E is excluded) -> E is excluded.
      - GOTHS (invalid: S) -> S excluded.
      - LOTTE (invalid: E) -> E excluded.
      - MOTHS (invalid: M and S) -> M and S excluded.
      - NOTCH (invalid: N and C) -> N and C excluded.
      - POTTY (valid, but duplicate T) -> we avoid duplicates for now.
      - ROTCH (invalid: R and C) -> R excluded.
      - WOT? (not 5 letters)

  So few options without duplicates? Actually, ""POTTY"" is one, but duplicates.

Words with T at 4:
  - _ O _ T _ :
      - FORTH (invalid: R) -> R excluded.
      - FORTY (invalid: R) -> R excluded.
      - POUTY (valid: P, O, U, T, Y) -> no duplicates, and no excluded letters.
      - DOUTY? (not common, but D, O, U, T, Y -> valid, but we prefer common words)
      - GOUTY (valid: G, O, U, T, Y) -> same as pouty but with G instead of P.

So we have:
  - TOUGH (T at 1)
  - POUTY (T at 4)
  - GOUTY (T at 4) 

We can also consider other words without T? But we know T is in the word, so we should include it to get position information.

But we don't have to include T in every guess? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient. Since we know T is in the word, we can try to find its position.

Given that, let's choose between ""tough"" and ""pouty"".

We want to cover more new letters. 
- ""tough"": uses T, O, U, G, H -> new letters: U, G, H (T and O we already know about, but O is fixed and T is known to be present).
- ""pouty"": uses P, O, U, T, Y -> new letters: P, U, Y.

We haven't tried U, G, H, P, Y. Both are good.

But note: we have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We want to maximize information.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have T? But that might not help us locate T. However, if we don't include T, we might not get information about its position, but we can test other letters. But we know T is in the word, so we can use that to our advantage by including it.

But let me think: we can also try to use a word that has T in a different position than we are considering? We are considering positions 1,3,4. We can test T in position 3, for example, without duplicates.

But we couldn't find a common word without duplicates for T in position 3. So let's stick with T in position 1 or 4.

Another candidate: ""DOUBT"" -> D, O, U, B, T. Pattern: D O U B T. 
- This has T at the end? But in the feedback for ""moist"", T was at the end and got a '-', meaning T is not at position 5. So if we put T at position 5 again, we know it will be wrong. But we are trying to find the position of T. So ""doubt"" has T at position 5, which we know is incorrect. So that would be a waste? Because we know T is not at position 5, so we shouldn't put it there.

Therefore, we must avoid putting T at position 5.

So ""doubt"" is invalid because it places T at position 5, which we know is wrong.

Similarly, we must avoid putting T at position 2 because that is O.

So we are left with positions 1, 3, 4.

Now, let's choose between ""tough"" and ""pouty"". Both are valid and common.

We can also consider ""BOUGH"" (B, O, U, G, H) -> but this does not contain T. We know T is in the word, so if we guess ""bough"", we might not get information about T. However, we can still use it to test other letters.

But if we guess ""bough"", and the secret word has T, then we will get feedback that we are missing T? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. So if we guess ""bough"", we will get:
  - B: ? 
  - O: ✓ (fixed at position 2)
  - U: ? 
  - G: ? 
  - H: ?

And we won't get any information about T because we didn't guess it. But we already know T is in the word, so we don't need to confirm that. However, we don't know the position of T. So if we don't include T, we won't learn where it is.

Therefore, it's better to include T in our guess to narrow down its position.

So we go back to including T.

Now, between ""tough"" and ""pouty"", which one? 

We can also consider ""GOUTY"" (G, O, U, T, Y) which is similar to ""pouty"" but with G instead of P.

But let's pick one that uses more common consonants. 

I think ""tough"" is a good choice because it uses G and H, which are common.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position we are unsure about. We have two possibilities: T at 1 or T at 4 (or 3, but we don't have a good word without duplicates). 

We can try to test T at position 1 with ""tough"". If the feedback shows T as ✓, then we know T is at position 1. If not, then T must be at position 3 or 4. But if we get T as 'x', that would be a problem because we know T is in the word. But in ""tough"", T is at position 1, so if the secret word has T at position 1, we get ✓. If T is at position 3 or 4, then we would get T as '-' (because it's in the word but not at position 1). But we know T is in the word, so it cannot be 'x'. So we will either get ✓ or '-'.

Similarly, if we choose ""pouty"", T is at position 4. Then we will get either ✓ (if T is at position 4) or '-' (if T is at position 1 or 3).

So both are valid.

But note: if we choose ""tough"" and T is not at position 1, we get T as '-', and we still don't know if it's at 3 or 4. Similarly, if we choose ""pouty"" and T is not at 4, we get T as '-' and we don't know if it's at 1 or 3.

So we might need another guess to disambiguate.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in position 3? But we don't have a common word without duplicates. 

What about ""BOUTS""? But S is excluded. Invalid.

""DOUTT""? Not a word.

""LOUTY""? Not common, but L, O, U, T, Y -> valid? But ""louty"" is not a common word. We should stick to common words.

Another idea: ""THUMB"" -> T, H, U, M, B -> but M is excluded (from ""moist"" feedback: M was x). So invalid.

""LOTUS"" -> L, O, T, U, S -> but S is excluded. Invalid.

So we are limited.

Therefore, I think we should go with ""tough"" or ""pouty"". Let's choose ""tough"" because it uses G and H, which are common.

So guess: ""tough""

But let me check: the pattern is T O U G H.

We know O is at position 2, so that's fixed.

If the secret word is ""tough"", we get it right. Otherwise, we get feedback.

But the secret word might be something else, like ""pouty"" or ""gouty"", but we are guessing ""tough"".

We are on the third guess, so we have room.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't fix T to one position but tests multiple possibilities? But that's hard.

Another candidate: ""PUTTY"" -> but duplicate T and we avoid duplicates.

I think ""tough"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with ""tough"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E not in the word).
- ""moist"" showed:
  - O is correct and in position 2 (so the secret word is `_ O _ _ _`).
  - T is in the word but not in position 5 (since it received `-`).
  - M, I, S are not in the word.

The secret word must:
- Have O as the second letter.
- Contain T, but not in position 5 (positions 1, 3, or 4 are possible).
- Exclude C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

For the next guess, ""tough"" is chosen because:
- It tests T in position 1 (to check if T is in position 1).
- It uses new common letters (U, G, H) to gather more information.
- It avoids all excluded letters and fits the pattern `_ O _ _ _`.

<guess>tough</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)
Guess 3: tough -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(✓) U(x) G(x) H(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

1. **crane**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these.
2. **moist**: 
   - M: absent (x)
   - O: correct and in position (✓) — so the second letter is O.
   - I: absent (x)
   - S: absent (x)
   - T: present but wrong position (-) — so T is in the word, but not at position 5.
3. **tough**:
   - T: present but wrong position (-) — so T is in the word, but not at position 1 (since we guessed it at position 1 and got '-'). 
   - O: correct and in position (✓) — confirms second letter is O.
   - U: absent (x) — not in the word.
   - G: absent (x) — not in the word.
   - H: absent (x) — not in the word.

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ O _ _ _
- The word contains the letter T, but not in position 1 or 5 (from ""moist"" and ""tough"").
- Therefore, T must be in position 3 or 4.

Additionally, the following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, U, G, H.

We need to avoid these letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, M, N, R, S, U.

Available letters: B, D, F, K, L, O, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. (Note: O is fixed at position 2, and T is in the word at position 3 or 4.)

The secret word pattern: [letter1] O [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

With T in position 3 or 4.

We must form a word with the available letters and the constraints.

Let's consider the two cases:

**Case 1: T in position 3**
Pattern: _ O T _ _

The word would be: ? O T ? ?

We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with letters from the available set (B, D, F, K, L, P, V, W, X, Y, Z) and avoid the excluded letters.

Possible words:
- BOT??
  - We need two more letters. But note: we have excluded many letters. 
  - Example: BOTHY? But H is excluded. 
  - BOTTY? But T is repeated? And Y is allowed. However, we don't know if T is repeated. But in previous feedback, we only know one T is present. But the word could have two T's? We have to consider.

But let's think of common words:
- ""BOTTY"" is not a common word. 
- ""DOTTY"" has D, O, T, T, Y -> but T is repeated and we have D and Y. However, D is allowed. But is ""dotty"" valid? Yes, but let's see if we can avoid duplicates for more information.

Alternatively, without duplicate T:
- ""DOTED"" -> but E and D? E is excluded. 
- ""BOTEL"" -> E is excluded? And L is allowed, but E is in ""botel""? Actually, ""botel"" is not common; we use ""hotel"" but H is excluded.

Another idea: ""LOTTE"" -> E excluded.

It's hard to find a word without duplicates and without excluded letters.

**Case 2: T in position 4**
Pattern: _ O _ T _

The word would be: ? O ? T ?

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with available letters.

Possible words:
- P O ? T Y -> ""POUTY"" (P, O, U, T, Y) but U is excluded (from ""tough"" feedback: U was x). So invalid.
- G O ? T Y -> ""GOUTY"" (G, O, U, T, Y) but U is excluded and G is excluded (from ""tough"": G was x). So invalid.
- F O ? T ? -> e.g., ""FORTY"" but R is excluded (from ""crane"": R was x). 
- W O ? T ? -> ""WOMAN"" but M and A are excluded? A and M are excluded. 
- ""VOLTY""? Not a word.

What about ""BOOTY""? But that has two O's? Pattern: B O O T Y -> but we have O at position 2, and if we put O at position 3, that would be a duplicate O. But we don't know if O is duplicated? The feedback for ""moist"" had O at position 2 and it was correct, but we don't know about other positions. However, in ""moist"", we only had one O, so we don't know.

But ""BOOTY"": B, O, O, T, Y. 
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 3: O (which is a duplicate)
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: Y

But we have to check if O can be duplicated? The feedback doesn't say anything against duplicates. So it's possible.

But we have to avoid excluded letters: B is allowed, O is allowed (but we know it's in the word), T is allowed, Y is allowed. And no excluded letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, M, N, R, S, U are excluded. So ""BOOTY"" is a candidate.

But note: in ""moist"", we had O at position 2 and it was correct. If the word has another O, we don't know. But in ""booty"", we have O at position 3. So if we guess ""booty"", we can get information about that.

Another candidate: ""DOZTY""? Not a word.

""POOTY""? Not common.

""TOWZY""? Not common.

But ""BOOTY"" is a common word.

Alternatively, ""LOOTY""? Not common.

Another idea: ""BOWAT""? Not a word.

Given the constraints, ""BOOTY"" seems a valid candidate.

But let's check the T position: in ""BOOTY"", T is at position 4. And we know T must be in position 3 or 4, so position 4 is possible.

Also, we have not tried B, O (duplicate), T, Y. We know O is in the word, but we don't know about duplicate O. We know T is in the word. B and Y are new.

But we have to consider: if the secret word has duplicate O, that's fine. But we are testing it.

Another candidate: ""BOLTY""? Not a word.

""BOTFLY""? 6 letters.

So ""BOOTY"" is a possibility.

But we also have the case for T in position 3. We need to cover that as well.

We can try a word that has T in position 3 and uses available letters.

For example, ""LOTAS""? Not a word, and S excluded.

""KOTOW""? K, O, T, O, W -> but duplicate O? Pattern: K O T O W. This has T at position 3. And letters: K, O, T, O, W. Excluded letters? K is allowed, O is known, T is known, W is allowed. And no excluded letters. ""Kotow"" is a word (variant of kowtow, but it can be 5 letters? Kotow is accepted as a word in some dictionaries).

But let's see: ""kotow"" means to bow, and it's valid.

So we have two candidates for the two cases:
- For T in position 3: ""KOTOW"" (K O T O W)
- For T in position 4: ""BOOTY"" (B O O T Y)

But we don't know which case is true. We need to choose one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't assume T's position but tests multiple possibilities? But that might be hard.

We know T is in position 3 or 4. We can choose a word that has T in position 3 and also tests other letters, or in position 4.

But we have to pick one.

We can also consider: we have not tried many letters. We should try to cover more new letters.

In ""BOOTY"": new letters are B, O (duplicate), T (known), Y. But we are testing duplicate O and T at position 4.

In ""KOTOW"": new letters K, O (duplicate), T (known), W. Testing T at position 3 and duplicate O.

But note: we are on the fourth guess. We have 3 guesses left (since we started with 6).

We can also consider a word that doesn't have T? But we know T is in the word, so we should use that. However, if we don't include T, we might not get information about its position, but we can test other letters. But we are limited on guesses.

But let's think: if we guess a word without T, and it turns out T is in the word (which it is), we won't get any new info on T. So it's better to include T to resolve its position.

So we have to choose between T in position 3 or 4.

How to decide? We can look at frequency or just pick one.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has T in position 3 and also has a letter that can be in position 4 or 5 to cover more ground.

But let's list all possible words that fit.

Given the constraints, the possible words might be few.

We can try:

- T in position 3: words like ? O T ? ? with available letters: B, D, F, K, L, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but T is at 3, so for other positions: 1,4,5)

  - B O T ? ? -> BOTCH (C,H excluded), BOTHY (H excluded), BOTTY (duplicate T, but allowed? and Y -> ""botty"" is not common)
  - D O T ? ? -> DOTED (E excluded), DOTTY (duplicate T, Y)
  - F O T ? ? -> FOTCH? not a word
  - K O T ? ? -> KOTOW (K O T O W) -> valid
  - L O T ? ? -> LOTAS (S excluded), LOTTE (E excluded), LOTTO (duplicate T, O) -> ""lotto"" is valid, but O is duplicate and T duplicate? Pattern: L O T T O. But we have O at position 2 and 5? And T at 3 and 4? But we know T is in the word, but we don't know about duplicates. ""LOTTO"" has two T's and two O's. But we are avoiding duplicates? We can try, but it might not be efficient.

- T in position 4: ? O ? T ? 
  - B O ? T Y -> ""BOOTY"" (B O O T Y) or ""BORTY"" (but R excluded), ""BOTTY"" (T duplicate, but if we put T at 4 and 5? ""BOTTY"" has T at 3 and 4? No, ""botty"" is B O T T Y, so T at 3 and 4. But we are considering T at 4 only? In this case, for position 4, we want T at 4, so the word is ? O ? T Y. For example, ""BOOTY"" has O at 3 and T at 4. Or ""POUTY"" but U excluded. 
  - D O ? T Y -> ""DOTTY"" has T at 3 and 4, not at 4 alone. ""DOWTY""? Not a word.
  - F O ? T Y -> ""FORTY"" R excluded.
  - K O ? T Y -> ""KOTY""? Not 5 letters.
  - L O ? T Y -> ""LOTTY"" has T at 3 and 4? ""LOTTY"" is L O T T Y -> T at 3 and 4. But we want T only at 4? Then we need a word with no T at 3. For example, ""LOFTY"" -> L, O, F, T, Y. But F is allowed. Pattern: L O F T Y. This has T at position 4. And no duplicate T. And letters: L, O, F, T, Y. All allowed? Excluded letters: none of the excluded. So ""LOFTY"" is a valid word.

Oh! ""LOFTY"" is a great candidate for T in position 4.

Similarly, for T in position 3, we have ""KOTOW"".

But ""LOFTY"" has T at position 4, which is one of the possibilities.

And it uses new letters: L, F, T, Y (O is fixed).

So let's consider ""LOFTY"".

Pattern: L O F T Y

- Position 1: L
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 3: F
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: Y

This avoids all excluded letters and tests T at position 4.

If T is indeed at position 4, we might get T as correct. If not, then T must be at position 3.

Moreover, we test L, F, and Y.

So this seems a good guess.

Similarly, we could test T at position 3 with a word like ""KOTOW"", but ""LOFTY"" uses more common letters? F and L are common.

But let's compare:

- ""LOFTY"": tests L, F, T, Y (and O)
- ""KOTOW"": tests K, T, O (duplicate), W

We have not tried L, F, Y, K, W. Both are good.

But ""LOFTY"" is a more common word.

Also, if we guess ""LOFTY"" and T is not at position 4, we know T must be at position 3, and we can focus on that in the next guess.

Similarly, if we get feedback that T is at position 4, then we might be close to the word.

So I think ""LOFTY"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""LOFTY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are not in the word.
- **Guess 2 (moist)**:
  - O is correct and in position 2 (✓), confirming the pattern `_ O _ _ _`.
  - T is present but in the wrong position (-), so T is in the word but not at position 5.
  - M, I, S are absent (x).
- **Guess 3 (tough)**:
  - T is present but in the wrong position (-), so T is not at position 1 (and not at position 5, from Guess 2).
  - O is correct and in position 2 (✓), reaffirming the pattern.
  - U, G, H are absent (x).

### Key Insights:
- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ O _ _ _` (O is the second letter).
- **T Position**: T must be in position 3 or 4 (since it cannot be in 1, 2, or 5).
- **Absent Letters**: A, C, E, G, H, I, M, N, R, S, U (cannot be in the word).
- **Available Letters**: B, D, F, K, L, O, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (O and T are confirmed in the word).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test T in position 4 (since position 3 is also possible, but we need to resolve T's location).
- Use new high-frequency letters (e.g., L, F, Y) to maximize information.
- Avoid absent letters and ensure the word fits the pattern `_ O _ T _` (for T in position 4).

**Chosen Guess: LOFTY**  
- **Why?**  
  - Tests T in position 4: If T is correct (✓), we lock in position 4. If T is present but wrong position (-), it must be in position 3.  
  - Tests new letters: L (position 1), F (position 3), Y (position 5).  
  - Avoids all absent letters and uses common consonants/vowels.  
  - Valid English word (meaning ""high or elevated"").

Also, it\'s a common word.\n\n However, let\'s check frequency of letters:\n   After removing C,R,A,N,E, high frequency letters are O, I, S, T, L, U, B, D, G, H, M, P.\n\n ""MOIST"" covers O, I, S, T, M. That\'s good.\n\n Alternatively ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D -> also good.\n\n But note: we have only 6 tries and we want maximum information. ""MOIST"" has two vowels (O,I) and three consonants, which is balanced.\n\n Another candidate: ""POINT"" (P, O, I, N, T) but N is already excluded? Wait, no: N was excluded, so N cannot be used. So ""POINT"" is invalid because it contains N? Let me see:\n   Our first guess feedback said N(x), meaning there is no N. So we must avoid N.\n\n Therefore, ""POINT"" contains N -> invalid.\n\n So words we can use: ""MOIST"", ""BUILD"", ""GHOUL"", ""SPLIT"", etc.\n\n Considering ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T -> these are all new and avoid banned letters.\n\n Similarly, ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> also good.\n\n Which word? ""SOUTH"" (S, O, U, T, H) is another candidate.\n\n I think ""MOIST"" and ""SPLIT"" are both strong because they have S and T which are very common.\n\n Let me pick ""MOIST"" for this guess.\n\n Alternatively, we can pick ""GHOUL"" but it has G, H, O, U, L which are less common and U is less frequent. But avoiding previously tried letters is necessary.\n\n Since ""MOIST"" uses 5 letters that are all high frequency and we haven\'t tried, it should be good.\n\n So, I\'ll guess ""MOIST"".After the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", we know that the letters **C, R, A, N, and E** are **not in the secret word**. Therefore, we need a new guess that avoids these letters entirely and tests new common letters.\n\nHigh-value letters to try next include **O, I, S, T, M** (common vowels and consonants not yet tested). The word **""moist""** uses these letters and is a valid English 5-letter word. This guess will help gather new information about the secret word.\n\n<guess>moist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n1. ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as \'x\', meaning none of these letters are in the secret word.\n2. ""moist"": \n   - M: x (not in the word)\n   - O: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, so the second letter of the secret word is O)\n   - I: x (not in the word)\n   - S: x (not in the word)\n   - T: - (in the word but in the wrong position)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word has the letter O in the second position: _ O _ _ _\n- The secret word contains the letter T, but not in the last position (since in ""moist"" it was at the end and got a \'-\', meaning it\'s present but not at the end).\n- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.\n\nAlso, note that T is in the word but not at the end. Since the second position is O, T must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait, in ""moist"", T was in position 5 and got a \'-\', meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So T must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nHowever, we must avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Has O as the second letter.\n- Contains T, but not at the end (so not in position 5) and not in position 2 (which is O).\n- Avoids the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.\n\nPossible positions for T: 1, 3, or 4.\n\nWe also need to choose other letters that are not in the excluded set. The available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and T, but we are using T once, and O is fixed at position 2).\n\nWe should try to cover more common letters to maximize information.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit the pattern: [letter1] O [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]\n\nWith T being in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.\n\nOption 1: T in position 1 -> T O _ _ _\nOption 2: T in position 3 -> _ O T _ _\nOption 3: T in position 4 -> _ O _ T _\n\nWe also know that the word must contain T and O (and O is fixed at position 2).\n\nLet\'s consider common words:\n\nFor T in position 1: \n  - TOUCH? But C is excluded -> invalid.\n  - TOUGH? G and H are allowed. Pattern: T O U G H -> but we have U, G, H. Also, we haven\'t tried U, G, H. So ""tough"" is a candidate.\n\nFor T in position 3:\n  - _ O T _ _ : e.g., ""MOTEL"" -> but M and E are excluded. \n  - ""POTTY"" -> P, O, T, T, Y -> but T is repeated? And we don\'t know if T is repeated. Also, Y is allowed. However, we have two T\'s? The feedback for ""moist"" had only one T and it was marked as present. But the secret word might have two T\'s? We don\'t know. But in ""moist"" we only had one T, and it was marked as present, so at least one T. But the word could have more.\n\nBut we must avoid S, which is in ""potty""? No, ""potty"" has no S. But we have to check the letters: P, O, T, T, Y. Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S -> none of these, so it\'s allowed. However, we have two T\'s. But the feedback for ""moist"" only told us about one T? Actually, the feedback per letter: in ""moist"", the T was at the end and marked as present. If the word had two T\'s, we might have gotten more feedback? But in ""moist"" we only provided one T, so we don\'t know about duplicates. So ""potty"" is a possibility.\n\nBut let\'s look for more common words.\n\nAnother option for T in position 3: ""BOTCH"" -> but C is excluded. ""DOTTY"" -> D, O, T, T, Y -> again, two T\'s.\n\nFor T in position 4: _ O _ T _\n  - e.g., ""FORTY"" -> but F, O, R, T, Y -> R is excluded (from first guess: R was x). So invalid.\n  - ""POUTY"" -> P, O, U, T, Y -> no excluded letters? P, O, U, T, Y: O is fixed, P, U, T, Y are allowed. So ""pouty"" is a candidate.\n\nBut note: we have T in position 4. And in ""moist"", T was at position 5 and was marked as present but wrong position. So if T is at position 4 in the secret word, then in ""moist"" (which had T at position 5) we would get a \'-\' for T, which we did. So that matches.\n\nNow, we have two strong candidates: \n  - ""tough"" (T at position 1)\n  - ""pouty"" (T at position 4)\n\nBut we also have the option of T at position 3, e.g., ""potty"", but that has two T\'s. We don\'t know if the word has two T\'s, so we might get less information if we guess a word with duplicate letters. It\'s better to avoid duplicates to cover more letters.\n\nSo let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\nTherefore, ""tough"" and ""pouty"" both have unique letters.\n\n""tough"": T, O, U, G, H -> letters: T, O, U, G, H. We know O is fixed at position 2. So the word is T O U G H.\n\n""pouty"": P, O, U, T, Y -> P, O, U, T, Y. Pattern: P O U T Y.\n\nWhich one to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nWe have not tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBoth words use U. ""tough"" uses T, U, G, H. ""pouty"" uses P, U, T, Y.\n\nWe already know T is in the word, so we don\'t need to test T again? But we are including T to confirm its position. However, we are forced to include T because we know it\'s in the word.\n\nBut we can choose a word that doesn\'t have T? No, because we must include T? Actually, we don\'t have to, but we know T is in the word, so if we don\'t include T, we might not get information about its position. But we are trying to find the word, so we should use the information we have.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has T and also other new letters.\n\nBut both words are valid.\n\nAnother idea: we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has O, and we haven\'t tried U (which is a vowel). Both words have U.\n\nBut we also know that the word does not have A, E, I (from previous feedback). So the only vowels left are O (which we have) and U. So the word might have U.\n\nWe can also consider words without U? But we don\'t have to.\n\nLet\'s list more words without duplicates and without excluded letters:\n\nPattern: _ O _ _ _\n\nWith T in the word, but not at position 2 or 5? Actually, in the feedback for ""moist"", T was at position 5 and got a \'-\', meaning T is in the word but not at position 5. So T can be at 1, 3, or 4.\n\nWords with T at 1: \n  - TOUCH (invalid: C)\n  - TOUGH (valid: T, O, U, G, H)\n  - TOUR? (5 letters? no, tour is 4)\n  - TOUTS (invalid: S) -> S is excluded.\n  - TOUZY? (not common, and Z and Y are less common)\n\nWords with T at 3:\n  - _ O T _ _ : \n      - BOTCH (invalid: C)\n      - DOTAL (invalid: A) -> A is excluded.\n      - DOTED (invalid: E and D? D is allowed, but E is excluded) -> E is excluded.\n      - GOTHS (invalid: S) -> S excluded.\n      - LOTTE (invalid: E) -> E excluded.\n      - MOTHS (invalid: M and S) -> M and S excluded.\n      - NOTCH (invalid: N and C) -> N and C excluded.\n      - POTTY (valid, but duplicate T) -> we avoid duplicates for now.\n      - ROTCH (invalid: R and C) -> R excluded.\n      - WOT? (not 5 letters)\n\n  So few options without duplicates? Actually, ""POTTY"" is one, but duplicates.\n\nWords with T at 4:\n  - _ O _ T _ :\n      - FORTH (invalid: R) -> R excluded.\n      - FORTY (invalid: R) -> R excluded.\n      - POUTY (valid: P, O, U, T, Y) -> no duplicates, and no excluded letters.\n      - DOUTY? (not common, but D, O, U, T, Y -> valid, but we prefer common words)\n      - GOUTY (valid: G, O, U, T, Y) -> same as pouty but with G instead of P.\n\nSo we have:\n  - TOUGH (T at 1)\n  - POUTY (T at 4)\n  - GOUTY (T at 4) \n\nWe can also consider other words without T? But we know T is in the word, so we should include it to get position information.\n\nBut we don\'t have to include T in every guess? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient. Since we know T is in the word, we can try to find its position.\n\nGiven that, let\'s choose between ""tough"" and ""pouty"".\n\nWe want to cover more new letters. \n- ""tough"": uses T, O, U, G, H -> new letters: U, G, H (T and O we already know about, but O is fixed and T is known to be present).\n- ""pouty"": uses P, O, U, T, Y -> new letters: P, U, Y.\n\nWe haven\'t tried U, G, H, P, Y. Both are good.\n\nBut note: we have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We want to maximize information.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have T? But that might not help us locate T. However, if we don\'t include T, we might not get information about its position, but we can test other letters. But we know T is in the word, so we can use that to our advantage by including it.\n\nBut let me think: we can also try to use a word that has T in a different position than we are considering? We are considering positions 1,3,4. We can test T in position 3, for example, without duplicates.\n\nBut we couldn\'t find a common word without duplicates for T in position 3. So let\'s stick with T in position 1 or 4.\n\nAnother candidate: ""DOUBT"" -> D, O, U, B, T. Pattern: D O U B T. \n- This has T at the end? But in the feedback for ""moist"", T was at the end and got a \'-\', meaning T is not at position 5. So if we put T at position 5 again, we know it will be wrong. But we are trying to find the position of T. So ""doubt"" has T at position 5, which we know is incorrect. So that would be a waste? Because we know T is not at position 5, so we shouldn\'t put it there.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid putting T at position 5.\n\nSo ""doubt"" is invalid because it places T at position 5, which we know is wrong.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid putting T at position 2 because that is O.\n\nSo we are left with positions 1, 3, 4.\n\nNow, let\'s choose between ""tough"" and ""pouty"". Both are valid and common.\n\nWe can also consider ""BOUGH"" (B, O, U, G, H) -> but this does not contain T. We know T is in the word, so if we guess ""bough"", we might not get information about T. However, we can still use it to test other letters.\n\nBut if we guess ""bough"", and the secret word has T, then we will get feedback that we are missing T? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. So if we guess ""bough"", we will get:\n  - B: ? \n  - O: ✓ (fixed at position 2)\n  - U: ? \n  - G: ? \n  - H: ?\n\nAnd we won\'t get any information about T because we didn\'t guess it. But we already know T is in the word, so we don\'t need to confirm that. However, we don\'t know the position of T. So if we don\'t include T, we won\'t learn where it is.\n\nTherefore, it\'s better to include T in our guess to narrow down its position.\n\nSo we go back to including T.\n\nNow, between ""tough"" and ""pouty"", which one? \n\nWe can also consider ""GOUTY"" (G, O, U, T, Y) which is similar to ""pouty"" but with G instead of P.\n\nBut let\'s pick one that uses more common consonants. \n\nI think ""tough"" is a good choice because it uses G and H, which are common.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position we are unsure about. We have two possibilities: T at 1 or T at 4 (or 3, but we don\'t have a good word without duplicates). \n\nWe can try to test T at position 1 with ""tough"". If the feedback shows T as ✓, then we know T is at position 1. If not, then T must be at position 3 or 4. But if we get T as \'x\', that would be a problem because we know T is in the word. But in ""tough"", T is at position 1, so if the secret word has T at position 1, we get ✓. If T is at position 3 or 4, then we would get T as \'-\' (because it\'s in the word but not at position 1). But we know T is in the word, so it cannot be \'x\'. So we will either get ✓ or \'-\'.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose ""pouty"", T is at position 4. Then we will get either ✓ (if T is at position 4) or \'-\' (if T is at position 1 or 3).\n\nSo both are valid.\n\nBut note: if we choose ""tough"" and T is not at position 1, we get T as \'-\', and we still don\'t know if it\'s at 3 or 4. Similarly, if we choose ""pouty"" and T is not at 4, we get T as \'-\' and we don\'t know if it\'s at 1 or 3.\n\nSo we might need another guess to disambiguate.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has T in position 3? But we don\'t have a common word without duplicates. \n\nWhat about ""BOUTS""? But S is excluded. Invalid.\n\n""DOUTT""? Not a word.\n\n""LOUTY""? Not common, but L, O, U, T, Y -> valid? But ""louty"" is not a common word. We should stick to common words.\n\nAnother idea: ""THUMB"" -> T, H, U, M, B -> but M is excluded (from ""moist"" feedback: M was x). So invalid.\n\n""LOTUS"" -> L, O, T, U, S -> but S is excluded. Invalid.\n\nSo we are limited.\n\nTherefore, I think we should go with ""tough"" or ""pouty"". Let\'s choose ""tough"" because it uses G and H, which are common.\n\nSo guess: ""tough""\n\nBut let me check: the pattern is T O U G H.\n\nWe know O is at position 2, so that\'s fixed.\n\nIf the secret word is ""tough"", we get it right. Otherwise, we get feedback.\n\nBut the secret word might be something else, like ""pouty"" or ""gouty"", but we are guessing ""tough"".\n\nWe are on the third guess, so we have room.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t fix T to one position but tests multiple possibilities? But that\'s hard.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PUTTY"" -> but duplicate T and we avoid duplicates.\n\nI think ""tough"" is a good choice.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""tough"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E not in the word).\n- ""moist"" showed:\n  - O is correct and in position 2 (so the secret word is `_ O _ _ _`).\n  - T is in the word but not in position 5 (since it received `-`).\n  - M, I, S are not in the word.\n\nThe secret word must:\n- Have O as the second letter.\n- Contain T, but not in position 5 (positions 1, 3, or 4 are possible).\n- Exclude C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.\n\nFor the next guess, ""tough"" is chosen because:\n- It tests T in position 1 (to check if T is in position 1).\n- It uses new common letters (U, G, H) to gather more information.\n- It avoids all excluded letters and fits the pattern `_ O _ _ _`.\n\n<guess>tough</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)\nGuess 3: tough -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(✓) U(x) G(x) H(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback from previous guesses:\n\n1. **crane**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x).

(Note: O is fixed at position 2, and T is in the word at position 3 or 4.)\n\nThe secret word pattern: [letter1] O [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]\n\nWith T in position 3 or 4.\n\nWe must form a word with the available letters and the constraints.\n\nLet\'s consider the two cases:\n\n**Case 1: T in position 3**\nPattern: _ O T _ _\n\nThe word would be: ? O T ? ?\n\nWe need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with letters from the available set (B, D, F, K, L, P, V, W, X, Y, Z) and avoid the excluded letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- BOT??\n  - We need two more letters. But note: we have excluded many letters. \n  - Example: BOTHY? But H is excluded. \n  - BOTTY? But T is repeated? And Y is allowed. However, we don\'t know if T is repeated. But in previous feedback, we only know one T is present. But the word could have two T\'s? We have to consider.\n\nBut let\'s think of common words:\n- ""BOTTY"" is not a common word. \n- ""DOTTY"" has D, O, T, T, Y -> but T is repeated and we have D and Y. However, D is allowed. But is ""dotty"" valid? Yes, but let\'s see if we can avoid duplicates for more information.\n\nAlternatively, without duplicate T:\n- ""DOTED"" -> but E and D? E is excluded. \n- ""BOTEL"" -> E is excluded? And L is allowed, but E is in ""botel""? Actually, ""botel"" is not common; we use ""hotel"" but H is excluded.\n\nAnother idea: ""LOTTE"" -> E excluded.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a word without duplicates and without excluded letters.\n\n**Case 2: T in position 4**\nPattern: _ O _ T _\n\nThe word would be: ? O ? T ?\n\nWe need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with available letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- P O ? T Y -> ""POUTY"" (P, O, U, T, Y) but U is excluded (from ""tough"" feedback: U was x). So invalid.\n- G O ? T Y -> ""GOUTY"" (G, O, U, T, Y) but U is excluded and G is excluded (from ""tough"": G was x). So invalid.\n- F O ? T ? -> e.g., ""FORTY"" but R is excluded (from ""crane"": R was x). \n- W O ? T ? -> ""WOMAN"" but M and A are excluded? A and M are excluded. \n- ""VOLTY""? Not a word.\n\nWhat about ""BOOTY""? But that has two O\'s? Pattern: B O O T Y -> but we have O at position 2, and if we put O at position 3, that would be a duplicate O. But we don\'t know if O is duplicated? The feedback for ""moist"" had O at position 2 and it was correct, but we don\'t know about other positions. However, in ""moist"", we only had one O, so we don\'t know.\n\nBut ""BOOTY"": B, O, O, T, Y. \n- Position 1: B\n- Position 2: O (fixed)\n- Position 3: O (which is a duplicate)\n- Position 4: T\n- Position 5: Y\n\nBut we have to check if O can be duplicated? The feedback doesn\'t say anything against duplicates. So it\'s possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid excluded letters: B is allowed, O is allowed (but we know it\'s in the word), T is allowed, Y is allowed. And no excluded letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, M, N, R, S, U are excluded. So ""BOOTY"" is a candidate.\n\nBut note: in ""moist"", we had O at position 2 and it was correct. If the word has another O, we don\'t know. But in ""booty"", we have O at position 3. So if we guess ""booty"", we can get information about that.\n\nAnother candidate: ""DOZTY""? Not a word.\n\n""POOTY""? Not common.\n\n""TOWZY""? Not common.\n\nBut ""BOOTY"" is a common word.\n\nAlternatively, ""LOOTY""? Not common.\n\nAnother idea: ""BOWAT""? Not a word.\n\nGiven the constraints, ""BOOTY"" seems a valid candidate.\n\nBut let\'s check the T position: in ""BOOTY"", T is at position 4. And we know T must be in position 3 or 4, so position 4 is possible.\n\nAlso, we have not tried B, O (duplicate), T, Y. We know O is in the word, but we don\'t know about duplicate O. We know T is in the word. B and Y are new.\n\nBut we have to consider: if the secret word has duplicate O, that\'s fine. But we are testing it.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BOLTY""? Not a word.\n\n""BOTFLY""? 6 letters.\n\nSo ""BOOTY"" is a possibility.\n\nBut we also have the case for T in position 3. We need to cover that as well.\n\nWe can try a word that has T in position 3 and uses available letters.\n\nFor example, ""LOTAS""? Not a word, and S excluded.\n\n""KOTOW""? K, O, T, O, W -> but duplicate O? Pattern: K O T O W. This has T at position 3. And letters: K, O, T, O, W. Excluded letters? K is allowed, O is known, T is known, W is allowed. And no excluded letters. ""Kotow"" is a word (variant of kowtow, but it can be 5 letters? Kotow is accepted as a word in some dictionaries).\n\nBut let\'s see: ""kotow"" means to bow, and it\'s valid.\n\nSo we have two candidates for the two cases:\n- For T in position 3: ""KOTOW"" (K O T O W)\n- For T in position 4: ""BOOTY"" (B O O T Y)\n\nBut we don\'t know which case is true. We need to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t assume T\'s position but tests multiple possibilities? But that might be hard.\n\nWe know T is in position 3 or 4. We can choose a word that has T in position 3 and also tests other letters, or in position 4.\n\nBut we have to pick one.\n\nWe can also consider: we have not tried many letters. We should try to cover more new letters.\n\nIn ""BOOTY"": new letters are B, O (duplicate), T (known), Y. But we are testing duplicate O and T at position 4.\n\nIn ""KOTOW"": new letters K, O (duplicate), T (known), W. Testing T at position 3 and duplicate O.\n\nBut note: we are on the fourth guess. We have 3 guesses left (since we started with 6).\n\nWe can also consider a word that doesn\'t have T? But we know T is in the word, so we should use that. However, if we don\'t include T, we might not get information about its position, but we can test other letters. But we are limited on guesses.\n\nBut let\'s think: if we guess a word without T, and it turns out T is in the word (which it is), we won\'t get any new info on T. So it\'s better to include T to resolve its position.\n\nSo we have to choose between T in position 3 or 4.\n\nHow to decide? We can look at frequency or just pick one.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has T in position 3 and also has a letter that can be in position 4 or 5 to cover more ground.\n\nBut let\'s list all possible words that fit.\n\nGiven the constraints, the possible words might be few.\n\nWe can try:\n\n- T in position 3: words like ? O T ? ? with available letters: B, D, F, K, L, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but T is at 3, so for other positions: 1,4,5)\n\n  - B O T ? ? -> BOTCH (C,H excluded), BOTHY (H excluded), BOTTY (duplicate T, but allowed? and Y -> ""botty"" is not common)\n  - D O T ? ? -> DOTED (E excluded), DOTTY (duplicate T, Y)\n  - F O T ? ? -> FOTCH? not a word\n  - K O T ? ? -> KOTOW (K O T O W) -> valid\n  - L O T ? ? -> LOTAS (S excluded), LOTTE (E excluded), LOTTO (duplicate T, O) -> ""lotto"" is valid, but O is duplicate and T duplicate? Pattern: L O T T O. But we have O at position 2 and 5? And T at 3 and 4? But we know T is in the word, but we don\'t know about duplicates. ""LOTTO"" has two T\'s and two O\'s. But we are avoiding duplicates? We can try, but it might not be efficient.\n\n- T in position 4: ? O ? T ? \n  - B O ? T Y -> ""BOOTY"" (B O O T Y) or ""BORTY"" (but R excluded), ""BOTTY"" (T duplicate, but if we put T at 4 and 5? ""BOTTY"" has T at 3 and 4? No, ""botty"" is B O T T Y, so T at 3 and 4. But we are considering T at 4 only? In this case, for position 4, we want T at 4, so the word is ? O ? T Y. For example, ""BOOTY"" has O at 3 and T at 4. Or ""POUTY"" but U excluded. \n  - D O ? T Y -> ""DOTTY"" has T at 3 and 4, not at 4 alone. ""DOWTY""? Not a word.\n  - F O ? T Y -> ""FORTY"" R excluded.\n  - K O ? T Y -> ""KOTY""? Not 5 letters.\n  - L O ? T Y -> ""LOTTY"" has T at 3 and 4? ""LOTTY"" is L O T T Y -> T at 3 and 4. But we want T only at 4? Then we need a word with no T at 3. For example, ""LOFTY"" -> L, O, F, T, Y. But F is allowed. Pattern: L O F T Y. This has T at position 4. And no duplicate T. And letters: L, O, F, T, Y. All allowed? Excluded letters: none of the excluded. So ""LOFTY"" is a valid word.\n\nOh! ""LOFTY"" is a great candidate for T in position 4.\n\nSimilarly, for T in position 3, we have ""KOTOW"".\n\nBut ""LOFTY"" has T at position 4, which is one of the possibilities.\n\nAnd it uses new letters: L, F, T, Y (O is fixed).\n\nSo let\'s consider ""LOFTY"".\n\nPattern: L O F T Y\n\n- Position 1: L\n- Position 2: O (fixed)\n- Position 3: F\n- Position 4: T\n- Position 5: Y\n\nThis avoids all excluded letters and tests T at position 4.\n\nIf T is indeed at position 4, we might get T as correct. If not, then T must be at position 3.\n\nMoreover, we test L, F, and Y.\n\nSo this seems a good guess.\n\nSimilarly, we could test T at position 3 with a word like ""KOTOW"", but ""LOFTY"" uses more common letters? F and L are common.\n\nBut let\'s compare:\n\n- ""LOFTY"": tests L, F, T, Y (and O)\n- ""KOTOW"": tests K, T, O (duplicate), W\n\nWe have not tried L, F, Y, K, W. Both are good.\n\nBut ""LOFTY"" is a more common word.\n\nAlso, if we guess ""LOFTY"" and T is not at position 4, we know T must be at position 3, and we can focus on that in the next guess.\n\nSimilarly, if we get feedback that T is at position 4, then we might be close to the word.\n\nSo I think ""LOFTY"" is a good choice.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""LOFTY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are not in the word.\n- **Guess 2 (moist)**:\n  - O is correct and in position 2 (✓), confirming the pattern `_ O _ _ _`.\n  - T is present but in the wrong position (-), so T is in the word but not at position 5.\n  - M, I, S are absent (x).\n- **Guess 3 (tough)**:\n  - T is present but in the wrong position (-), so T is not at position 1 (and not at position 5, from Guess 2).\n  - O is correct and in position 2 (✓), reaffirming the pattern.\n  - U, G, H are absent (x).\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ O _ _ _` (O is the second letter).\n- **T Position**: T must be in position 3 or 4 (since it cannot be in 1, 2, or 5).\n- **Absent Letters**: A, C, E, G, H, I, M, N, R, S, U (cannot be in the word).\n- **Available Letters**: B, D, F, K, L, O, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (O and T are confirmed in the word).\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Test T in position 4 (since position 3 is also possible, but we need to resolve T\'s location).\n- Use new high-frequency letters (e.g., L, F, Y) to maximize information.\n- Avoid absent letters and ensure the word fits the pattern `_ O _ T _` (for T in position 4).\n\n**Chosen Guess: LOFTY**  \n- **Why?**  \n  - Tests T in position 4: If T is correct (✓), we lock in position 4. If T is present but wrong position (-), it must be in position 3.  \n  - Tests new letters: L (position 1), F (position 3), Y (position 5).  \n  - Avoids all absent letters and uses common consonants/vowels.  \n  - Valid English word (meaning ""high or elevated"").\n\n<guess>lofty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)\nGuess 3: tough -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(✓) U(x) G(x) H(x)\nGuess 4: lofty -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(✓) F(x) T(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

1. **crane**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these.
2. **moist**: 
   - M: absent (x)
   - O: correct and in position (✓) — so the second letter is O.
   - I: absent (x)
   - S: absent (x)
   - T: present but wrong position (-) — so T is in the word, but not at position 5.
3. **tough**:
   - T: present but wrong position (-) — so T is not at position 1 (and not at position 5 from previous).
   - O: correct and in position (✓) — confirms second letter is O.
   - U: absent (x)
   - G: absent (x)
   - H: absent (x)
4. **lofty**:
   - L: absent (x)
   - O: correct and in position (✓)
   - F: absent (x)
   - T: correct and in position (✓) — so T is at position 4.
   - Y: correct and in position (✓) — so Y is at position 5.

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ O _ T Y
- The word contains T at position 4 and Y at position 5.
- The second letter is O, as before.

Additionally, the following letters are absent: A, C, E, G, H, I, L, M, N, R, S, U, F (from the feedback above).

We need to find the first and third letters. The first letter is unknown, and the third letter is unknown.

Constraints:
- The first letter must be one of the remaining available letters: B, D, K, P, V, W, X, Z (since O, T, Y are used, and we avoid the absent letters).
- The third letter must also be from the available letters, but it can be the same as the first if duplicated? However, we don't have information about duplicates yet.

But note: the word is _ O _ T Y, so positions 1 and 3 are open.

Available letters (not absent and not yet placed): B, D, K, P, V, W, X, Z. (Also, note that O, T, Y are already placed, so we don't need to use them again unless duplicated, but we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicates so far, so we might avoid them for now to maximize information.)

We need to form a 5-letter word that fits the pattern and uses the available letters.

Possible words:
- The word must end with ""OTTY""? No, the pattern is _ O _ T Y, so the last three are fixed as O, ?, T, Y? Actually, the pattern is:
  Position 1: unknown
  Position 2: O
  Position 3: unknown
  Position 4: T
  Position 5: Y

So the word is: [letter1] O [letter3] T Y

We need to choose letter1 and letter3 from the available letters: B, D, K, P, V, W, X, Z.

Now, what words fit this pattern?

Let's try:
- B O ? T Y: 
  - B O D T Y -> ""BODTY"" not a word.
  - B O K T Y -> ""BOKTY"" not a word.
  - B O P T Y -> ""BOPTY"" not a word.
  - B O W T Y -> ""BOWTY"" not a word.

- D O ? T Y:
  - D O B T Y -> ""DOBTY"" not a word.
  - D O K T Y -> ""DOKTY"" not a word.
  - D O P T Y -> ""DOPTY"" not a word.
  - D O W T Y -> ""DOWTY"" not a word.

- K O ? T Y:
  - K O B T Y -> ""KOBTY"" not a word.
  - K O D T Y -> ""KODTY"" not a word.
  - K O P T Y -> ""KOPTY"" not a word. (But ""kempt"" is a word but has E and M, which are excluded, and pattern doesn't match.)
  - K O W T Y -> ""KOWTY"" not a word.

- P O ? T Y:
  - P O B T Y -> ""POBTY"" not a word.
  - P O D T Y -> ""PODTY"" not a word.
  - P O K T Y -> ""POKTY"" not a word.
  - P O W T Y -> ""POWTY"" not a word. But ""pouty"" is a word but has U (excluded) and pattern: P O U T Y, which would be position 3 as U, but U is excluded.

- V O ? T Y:
  - V O B T Y -> ""VOBTY"" not a word.
  - V O D T Y -> ""VODTY"" not a word.
  - V O K T Y -> ""VOKTY"" not a word.
  - V O W T Y -> ""VOWTY"" not a word.

- W O ? T Y:
  - W O B T Y -> ""WOBTY"" not a word.
  - W O D T Y -> ""WODTY"" not a word.
  - W O K T Y -> ""WOKTY"" not a word. But ""wok"" is a word, but not 5 letters.
  - W O P T Y -> ""WOPTY"" not a word.

- X O ? T Y: Unlikely, e.g., ""XOFTY"" not a word.

- Z O ? T Y: 
  - Z O B T Y -> ""ZOBTY"" not a word.
  - etc.

This is problematic. None of these combinations form a word.

Perhaps we missed some available letters? We have B, D, K, P, V, W, X, Z. But maybe we can consider that the third letter might be a vowel? The only vowel we have left is not available because A, E, I, O, U are all excluded? O is in the word but already used at position 2. We don't have other vowels? The available vowels are none because A, E, I, U are excluded. So the third letter must be a consonant from the available set.

But we can't form a word. What's wrong?

Perhaps we have a duplicate letter? For example, maybe the word has two T's? But T is at position 4, and we have position 3 open. Could T be at position 3? But in the feedback for ""lofty"", we have T at position 4 marked as correct (✓). And in the pattern, position 3 is a different letter.

But in ""lofty"", we have:
  L(x) O(✓) F(x) T(✓) Y(✓)

So T is at position 4 and correct. So the secret word has T at position 4. Therefore, position 3 cannot be T? Unless the word has two T's? But in ""lofty"", we only provided one T (at position 4), so if there is a T at position 3, we wouldn't know because we didn't guess it. So it's possible that there is a T at position 3? But we have T at position 4, so if there is a T at position 3, then the word has two T's.

But in the feedback for ""moist"", we had T at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That T could be the same T as at position 4? But in ""moist"", T was at position 5, and in the secret word, T is at position 4, so that's why it was marked as present but wrong position. If there were two T's, we might have gotten an additional indication? But in ""moist"", we only had one T, so we only got one '-' for T. Similarly, in ""tough"", we had T at position 1 and got '-', which could be for the T at position 4 (or 3 if duplicated). But we don't have evidence for or against duplicates.

So perhaps the secret word has two T's? Then position 3 could be T.

But the pattern from ""lofty"" feedback: T is at position 4 and Y at 5, so the word is _ O _ T Y. If position 3 is T, then the word is _ O T T Y.

Is that possible? Then the word would be ? O T T Y.

Now, what words fit ? O T T Y? 
- B O T T Y -> ""BOTTY"" not a common word, but ""botty"" is informal for buttocks? It might be accepted in some dictionaries.
- P O T T Y -> ""POTTY"" is a common word (a small pot for children or a slang for crazy).

Similarly, ""dotty"" is D O T T Y, but D is available? But we have to check if D is allowed. D is not in the absent list, so it's available.

So possible words: ""POTTY"", ""BOTTY"", ""DOTTY"", etc.

But in ""lofty"", we guessed F at position 3 and it was absent. If the secret word is ""POTTY"", then position 3 is T, which we didn't guess in ""lofty"", so we got F as absent, which is correct.

Similarly, in ""moist"", we had T at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. In ""POTTY"", T is at positions 3 and 4, so the T at position 5 in ""moist"" would match one of the T's? But the feedback only marks one T? In ""moist"", we provided one T, so it would match one occurrence. Since position 5 is not a T (it's Y in ""POTTY""? No, ""POTTY"" is P O T T Y, so position 5 is Y, not T. So the T at position 5 in ""moist"" is not in the word at position 5, but it is in the word at positions 3 or 4. So the '-' is correct.

Similarly, in ""tough"", we had T at position 1 and got '-', which is correct because T is at 3 and 4.

So ""POTTY"" is a candidate.

But we have to check the absent letters: P is not absent, O is present, T is present, T again, Y is present. And no excluded letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, L, M, N, R, S, U, F are excluded. So P is allowed.

Similarly, ""DOTTY"" (D O T T Y) is also a candidate, with D.

""BOTTY"" (B O T T Y) is less common.

Now, what about the first letter? In ""POTTY"", it's P. In ""DOTTY"", it's D. In ""BOTTY"", it's B.

We need to choose one.

But we have only two guesses left (since we are on the fifth guess, and we started with 6). We can guess one of these.

But note: we also have to consider if there are words without duplicate T? But we couldn't find any. So likely, the word has duplicate T.

Therefore, the word is ? O T T Y, with the first letter being one of B, D, P.

We can try to guess ""POTTY"" because it's the most common.

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

What if the word is not with duplicate T? Then what could it be? We couldn't find any word without duplicate T that fits the pattern and avoids excluded letters.

So we must go with the duplicate T.

Therefore, we guess ""POTTY"".

But in ""POTTY"", we have T at position 3 and 4. In the feedback for ""lofty"", we only got T marked at position 4, but not at position 3 because we didn't guess it. So it's consistent.

So I think ""POTTY"" is the most likely.

But to be thorough, let's see if there is a word with a different letter at position 3.

For example, is there a word like ? O D T Y? But we couldn't find any. Similarly for other letters.

So we go with ""POTTY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ O _ T Y` (positions 2, 4, and 5 are fixed as O, T, Y).
- **Absent Letters**: A, C, E, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, R, S, U (cannot be in the word).
- **Available Letters for Positions 1 and 3**: B, D, K, P, V, W, X, Z.

### Analysis:
- No valid words were found without duplicate letters (e.g., `? O ? T Y` with distinct letters), suggesting the possibility of duplicate `T` at position 3.
- Words like **POTTY** (P O T T Y), **DOTTY** (D O T T Y), or **BOTTY** (B O T T Y) fit the pattern and use available letters.
- **POTTY** is the most common English word among these options.

### Next Guess: POTTY
- Tests if the word is **POTTY** (if correct, we win).
- If incorrect, feedback will confirm if `P` is in the word and provide info on position 3 (likely `T`).

<guess>potty</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we can deduce the following:

1. **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ O _ T Y` (O in position 2, T in position 4, Y in position 5).
2. **Absent Letters**: A, C, E, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, R, S, U (all marked ""x"" in previous feedback).
3. **Available Letters for Positions 1 and 3**: B, D, K, P, V, W, X, Z (since O, T, Y are already placed).

### Key Insight:
- No common English words fit `_ O _ T Y` without duplicate letters (e.g., `? O ? T Y` with distinct letters). This suggests the secret word likely has a **duplicate T** at position 3 (e.g., `? O T T Y`).
- Possible words include **POTTY**, **DOTTY**, or **BOTTY**. Among these, **POTTY** is the most common and likely candidate.

### Next Guess: POTTY
- **Why?**  
  - Tests `P` at position 1 and `T` at position 3 (duplicate).  
  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback will confirm if `P` is present and provide more clues for position 1.

<guess>potty</guess>",potty,"We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

1. **crane**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these.
2. **moist**: 
   - M: absent (x)
   - O: correct and in position (✓) — so the second letter is O.
   - I: absent (x)
   - S: absent (x)
   - T: present but wrong position (-) — so T is in the word, but not at position 5.
3. **tough**:
   - T: present but wrong position (-) — so T is not at position 1 (and not at position 5 from previous).
   - O: correct and in position (✓) — confirms second letter is O.
   - U: absent (x)
   - G: absent (x)
   - H: absent (x)
4. **lofty**:
   - L: absent (x)
   - O: correct and in position (✓)
   - F: absent (x)
   - T: correct and in position (✓) — so T is at position 4.
   - Y: correct and in position (✓) — so Y is at position 5.

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ O _ T Y
- The word contains T at position 4 and Y at position 5.
- The second letter is O, as before.

Additionally, the following letters are absent: A, C, E, G, H, I, L, M, N, R, S, U, F (from the feedback above).

We need to find the first and third letters. The first letter is unknown, and the third letter is unknown.

Constraints:
- The first letter must be one of the remaining available letters: B, D, K, P, V, W, X, Z (since O, T, Y are used, and we avoid the absent letters).
- The third letter must also be from the available letters, but it can be the same as the first if duplicated? However, we don't have information about duplicates yet.

But note: the word is _ O _ T Y, so positions 1 and 3 are open.

Available letters (not absent and not yet placed): B, D, K, P, V, W, X, Z. (Also, note that O, T, Y are already placed, so we don't need to use them again unless duplicated, but we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicates so far, so we might avoid them for now to maximize information.)

We need to form a 5-letter word that fits the pattern and uses the available letters.

Possible words:
- The word must end with ""OTTY""? No, the pattern is _ O _ T Y, so the last three are fixed as O, ?, T, Y? Actually, the pattern is:
  Position 1: unknown
  Position 2: O
  Position 3: unknown
  Position 4: T
  Position 5: Y

So the word is: [letter1] O [letter3] T Y

We need to choose letter1 and letter3 from the available letters: B, D, K, P, V, W, X, Z.

Now, what words fit this pattern?

Let's try:
- B O ? T Y: 
  - B O D T Y -> ""BODTY"" not a word.
  - B O K T Y -> ""BOKTY"" not a word.
  - B O P T Y -> ""BOPTY"" not a word.
  - B O W T Y -> ""BOWTY"" not a word.

  - D O K T Y -> ""DOKTY"" not a word.
  - D O P T Y -> ""DOPTY"" not a word.
  - D O W T Y -> ""DOWTY"" not a word.

- K O ? T Y:
  - K O B T Y -> ""KOBTY"" not a word.
  - K O D T Y -> ""KODTY"" not a word.
  - K O P T Y -> ""KOPTY"" not a word. (But ""kempt"" is a word but has E and M, which are excluded, and pattern doesn't match.)
  - K O W T Y -> ""KOWTY"" not a word.

- P O ? T Y:
  - P O B T Y -> ""POBTY"" not a word.
  - P O D T Y -> ""PODTY"" not a word.
  - P O K T Y -> ""POKTY"" not a word.
  - P O W T Y -> ""POWTY"" not a word. But ""pouty"" is a word but has U (excluded) and pattern: P O U T Y, which would be position 3 as U, but U is excluded.

- V O ? T Y:
  - V O B T Y -> ""VOBTY"" not a word.
  - V O D T Y -> ""VODTY"" not a word.
  - V O K T Y -> ""VOKTY"" not a word.

  - W O K T Y -> ""WOKTY"" not a word. But ""wok"" is a word, but not 5 letters.
  - W O P T Y -> ""WOPTY"" not a word.

- X O ? T Y: Unlikely, e.g., ""XOFTY"" not a word.

- Z O ? T Y: 
  - Z O B T Y -> ""ZOBTY"" not a word.
  - etc.

This is problematic. None of these combinations form a word.

Perhaps we missed some available letters? We have B, D, K, P, V, W, X, Z. But maybe we can consider that the third letter might be a vowel?

But in ""lofty"", we only provided one T (at position 4), so if there is a T at position 3, we wouldn't know because we didn't guess it. So it's possible that there is a T at position 3? But we have T at position 4, so if there is a T at position 3, then the word has two T's.

But in the feedback for ""moist"", we had T at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That T could be the same T as at position 4?

Is that possible? Then the word would be ? O T T Y.

Now, what words fit ? O T T Y? 
- B O T T Y -> ""BOTTY"" not a common word, but ""botty"" is informal for buttocks? It might be accepted in some dictionaries.

Similarly, ""dotty"" is D O T T Y, but D is available? But we have to check if D is allowed. D is not in the absent list, so it's available.

So possible words: ""POTTY"", ""BOTTY"", ""DOTTY"", etc.

But in ""lofty"", we guessed F at position 3 and it was absent. If the secret word is ""POTTY"", then position 3 is T, which we didn't guess in ""lofty"", so we got F as absent, which is correct.

So the T at position 5 in ""moist"" is not in the word at position 5, but it is in the word at positions 3 or 4. So the '-' is correct.

Similarly, in ""tough"", we had T at position 1 and got '-', which is correct because T is at 3 and 4.

So ""POTTY"" is a candidate.

But we have to check the absent letters: P is not absent, O is present, T is present, T again, Y is present. And no excluded letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, L, M, N, R, S, U, F are excluded. So P is allowed.

Similarly, ""DOTTY"" (D O T T Y) is also a candidate, with D.

""BOTTY"" (B O T T Y) is less common.

Now, what about the first letter? In ""POTTY"", it's P. In ""DOTTY"", it's D. In ""BOTTY"", it's B.

We need to choose one.

But we have only two guesses left (since we are on the fifth guess, and we started with 6). We can guess one of these.

But note: we also have to consider if there are words without duplicate T? But we couldn't find any. So likely, the word has duplicate T.

Therefore, the word is ? O T T Y, with the first letter being one of B, D, P.

We can try to guess ""POTTY"" because it's the most common.

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

What if the word is not with duplicate T? Then what could it be? We couldn't find any word without duplicate T that fits the pattern and avoids excluded letters.

So we must go with the duplicate T.

Therefore, we guess ""POTTY"".

But in ""POTTY"", we have T at position 3 and 4. In the feedback for ""lofty"", we only got T marked at position 4, but not at position 3 because we didn't guess it. So it's consistent.

So I think ""POTTY"" is the most likely.

But to be thorough, let's see if there is a word with a different letter at position 3.

For example, is there a word like ? O D T Y? But we couldn't find any. Similarly for other letters.

So we go with ""POTTY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ O _ T Y` (positions 2, 4, and 5 are fixed as O, T, Y).
- **Absent Letters**: A, C, E, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, R, S, U (cannot be in the word).
- **Available Letters for Positions 1 and 3**: B, D, K, P, V, W, X, Z.

### Analysis:
- No valid words were found without duplicate letters (e.g., `? O ? T Y` with distinct letters), suggesting the possibility of duplicate `T` at position 3.
- Words like **POTTY** (P O T T Y), **DOTTY** (D O T T Y), or **BOTTY** (B O T T Y) fit the pattern and use available letters.
- **POTTY** is the most common English word among these options.

### Next Guess: POTTY
- Tests if the word is **POTTY** (if correct, we win).
- If incorrect, feedback will confirm if `P` is in the word and provide info on position 3 (likely `T`).

<guess>potty</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we can deduce the following:

1. **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ O _ T Y` (O in position 2, T in position 4, Y in position 5).
2. **Absent Letters**: A, C, E, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, R, S, U (all marked ""x"" in previous feedback).
3. **Available Letters for Positions 1 and 3**: B, D, K, P, V, W, X, Z (since O, T, Y are already placed).

### Key Insight:
- No common English words fit `_ O _ T Y` without duplicate letters (e.g., `? O ? T Y` with distinct letters). This suggests the secret word likely has a **duplicate T** at position 3 (e.g., `? O T T Y`).
- Possible words include **POTTY**, **DOTTY**, or **BOTTY**. Among these, **POTTY** is the most common and likely candidate.

### Next Guess: POTTY
- **Why?**  
  - Tests `P` at position 1 and `T` at position 3 (duplicate).  
  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback will confirm if `P` is present and provide more clues for position 1.",Guess 5: potty -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) T(-) T(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word at all.
 Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of these five letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Since none of these letters are in the word, we must choose a new word that avoids all of these letters.

 We need to pick a word that uses entirely different letters. Also, we want to cover common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Common vowels that weren't in the first guess: I, O, U (we've tried A and E, now avoid them). Also, common consonants we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, L, M, P, S, T, etc.

 A good candidate might be a word like ""SPLIT"" or ""GHOUL"", but let me think of words that use high-frequency letters we haven't tried.

 Options:
   - We can try ""MOIST"": uses M, O, I, S, T -> all new letters.
   - Another option: ""PUDGY"" but less common.

 However, we must note that the word must be a valid English word.

 Alternatively, consider ""LIGHT"" (L, I, G, H, T) or ""POUND"" (P, O, U, N, D) but we know N is out from previous feedback? Actually, in the feedback N was x, meaning N is not in the word. But we are avoiding C, R, A, N, E.

 Since ""MOIST"" uses M, O, I, S, T and none of these C,R,A,N,E, it should be safe. Also, it's a common word.

 However, let's check frequency of letters:
   After removing C,R,A,N,E, high frequency letters are O, I, S, T, L, U, B, D, G, H, M, P.

 ""MOIST"" covers O, I, S, T, M. That's good.

 Alternatively ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D -> also good.

 But note: we have only 6 tries and we want maximum information. ""MOIST"" has two vowels (O,I) and three consonants, which is balanced.

 Another candidate: ""POINT"" (P, O, I, N, T) but N is already excluded? Wait, no: N was excluded, so N cannot be used. So ""POINT"" is invalid because it contains N? Let me see:
   Our first guess feedback said N(x), meaning there is no N. So we must avoid N.

 Therefore, ""POINT"" contains N -> invalid.

 So words we can use: ""MOIST"", ""BUILD"", ""GHOUL"", ""SPLIT"", etc.

 Considering ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T -> these are all new and avoid banned letters.

 Similarly, ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> also good.

 Which word? ""SOUTH"" (S, O, U, T, H) is another candidate.

 I think ""MOIST"" and ""SPLIT"" are both strong because they have S and T which are very common.

 Let me pick ""MOIST"" for this guess.

 Alternatively, we can pick ""GHOUL"" but it has G, H, O, U, L which are less common and U is less frequent. But avoiding previously tried letters is necessary.

 Since ""MOIST"" uses 5 letters that are all high frequency and we haven't tried, it should be good.

 So, I'll guess ""MOIST"".After the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", we know that the letters **C, R, A, N, and E** are **not in the secret word**. Therefore, we need a new guess that avoids these letters entirely and tests new common letters.

High-value letters to try next include **O, I, S, T, M** (common vowels and consonants not yet tested). The word **""moist""** uses these letters and is a valid English 5-letter word. This guess will help gather new information about the secret word.

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as 'x', meaning none of these letters are in the secret word.
2. ""moist"": 
   - M: x (not in the word)
   - O: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, so the second letter of the secret word is O)
   - I: x (not in the word)
   - S: x (not in the word)
   - T: - (in the word but in the wrong position)

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the letter O in the second position: _ O _ _ _
- The secret word contains the letter T, but not in the last position (since in ""moist"" it was at the end and got a '-', meaning it's present but not at the end).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

Also, note that T is in the word but not at the end. Since the second position is O, T must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait, in ""moist"", T was in position 5 and got a '-', meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So T must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

However, we must avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has O as the second letter.
- Contains T, but not at the end (so not in position 5) and not in position 2 (which is O).
- Avoids the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

Possible positions for T: 1, 3, or 4.

We also need to choose other letters that are not in the excluded set. The available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and T, but we are using T once, and O is fixed at position 2).

We should try to cover more common letters to maximize information.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern: [letter1] O [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

With T being in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.

Option 1: T in position 1 -> T O _ _ _
Option 2: T in position 3 -> _ O T _ _
Option 3: T in position 4 -> _ O _ T _

We also know that the word must contain T and O (and O is fixed at position 2).

Let's consider common words:

For T in position 1: 
  - TOUCH? But C is excluded -> invalid.
  - TOUGH? G and H are allowed. Pattern: T O U G H -> but we have U, G, H. Also, we haven't tried U, G, H. So ""tough"" is a candidate.

For T in position 3:
  - _ O T _ _ : e.g., ""MOTEL"" -> but M and E are excluded. 
  - ""POTTY"" -> P, O, T, T, Y -> but T is repeated? And we don't know if T is repeated. Also, Y is allowed. However, we have two T's? The feedback for ""moist"" had only one T and it was marked as present. But the secret word might have two T's? We don't know. But in ""moist"" we only had one T, and it was marked as present, so at least one T. But the word could have more.

But we must avoid S, which is in ""potty""? No, ""potty"" has no S. But we have to check the letters: P, O, T, T, Y. Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S -> none of these, so it's allowed. However, we have two T's. But the feedback for ""moist"" only told us about one T? Actually, the feedback per letter: in ""moist"", the T was at the end and marked as present. If the word had two T's, we might have gotten more feedback? But in ""moist"" we only provided one T, so we don't know about duplicates. So ""potty"" is a possibility.

But let's look for more common words.

Another option for T in position 3: ""BOTCH"" -> but C is excluded. ""DOTTY"" -> D, O, T, T, Y -> again, two T's.

For T in position 4: _ O _ T _
  - e.g., ""FORTY"" -> but F, O, R, T, Y -> R is excluded (from first guess: R was x). So invalid.
  - ""POUTY"" -> P, O, U, T, Y -> no excluded letters? P, O, U, T, Y: O is fixed, P, U, T, Y are allowed. So ""pouty"" is a candidate.

But note: we have T in position 4. And in ""moist"", T was at position 5 and was marked as present but wrong position. So if T is at position 4 in the secret word, then in ""moist"" (which had T at position 5) we would get a '-' for T, which we did. So that matches.

Now, we have two strong candidates: 
  - ""tough"" (T at position 1)
  - ""pouty"" (T at position 4)

But we also have the option of T at position 3, e.g., ""potty"", but that has two T's. We don't know if the word has two T's, so we might get less information if we guess a word with duplicate letters. It's better to avoid duplicates to cover more letters.

So let's avoid duplicates for now.

Therefore, ""tough"" and ""pouty"" both have unique letters.

""tough"": T, O, U, G, H -> letters: T, O, U, G, H. We know O is fixed at position 2. So the word is T O U G H.

""pouty"": P, O, U, T, Y -> P, O, U, T, Y. Pattern: P O U T Y.

Which one to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible.

We have not tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Both words use U. ""tough"" uses T, U, G, H. ""pouty"" uses P, U, T, Y.

We already know T is in the word, so we don't need to test T again? But we are including T to confirm its position. However, we are forced to include T because we know it's in the word.

But we can choose a word that doesn't have T? No, because we must include T? Actually, we don't have to, but we know T is in the word, so if we don't include T, we might not get information about its position. But we are trying to find the word, so we should use the information we have.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T and also other new letters.

But both words are valid.

Another idea: we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has O, and we haven't tried U (which is a vowel). Both words have U.

But we also know that the word does not have A, E, I (from previous feedback). So the only vowels left are O (which we have) and U. So the word might have U.

We can also consider words without U? But we don't have to.

Let's list more words without duplicates and without excluded letters:

Pattern: _ O _ _ _

With T in the word, but not at position 2 or 5? Actually, in the feedback for ""moist"", T was at position 5 and got a '-', meaning T is in the word but not at position 5. So T can be at 1, 3, or 4.

Words with T at 1: 
  - TOUCH (invalid: C)
  - TOUGH (valid: T, O, U, G, H)
  - TOUR? (5 letters? no, tour is 4)
  - TOUTS (invalid: S) -> S is excluded.
  - TOUZY? (not common, and Z and Y are less common)

Words with T at 3:
  - _ O T _ _ : 
      - BOTCH (invalid: C)
      - DOTAL (invalid: A) -> A is excluded.
      - DOTED (invalid: E and D? D is allowed, but E is excluded) -> E is excluded.
      - GOTHS (invalid: S) -> S excluded.
      - LOTTE (invalid: E) -> E excluded.
      - MOTHS (invalid: M and S) -> M and S excluded.
      - NOTCH (invalid: N and C) -> N and C excluded.
      - POTTY (valid, but duplicate T) -> we avoid duplicates for now.
      - ROTCH (invalid: R and C) -> R excluded.
      - WOT? (not 5 letters)

  So few options without duplicates? Actually, ""POTTY"" is one, but duplicates.

Words with T at 4:
  - _ O _ T _ :
      - FORTH (invalid: R) -> R excluded.
      - FORTY (invalid: R) -> R excluded.
      - POUTY (valid: P, O, U, T, Y) -> no duplicates, and no excluded letters.
      - DOUTY? (not common, but D, O, U, T, Y -> valid, but we prefer common words)
      - GOUTY (valid: G, O, U, T, Y) -> same as pouty but with G instead of P.

So we have:
  - TOUGH (T at 1)
  - POUTY (T at 4)
  - GOUTY (T at 4) 

We can also consider other words without T? But we know T is in the word, so we should include it to get position information.

But we don't have to include T in every guess? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient. Since we know T is in the word, we can try to find its position.

Given that, let's choose between ""tough"" and ""pouty"".

We want to cover more new letters. 
- ""tough"": uses T, O, U, G, H -> new letters: U, G, H (T and O we already know about, but O is fixed and T is known to be present).
- ""pouty"": uses P, O, U, T, Y -> new letters: P, U, Y.

We haven't tried U, G, H, P, Y. Both are good.

But note: we have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We want to maximize information.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have T? But that might not help us locate T. However, if we don't include T, we might not get information about its position, but we can test other letters. But we know T is in the word, so we can use that to our advantage by including it.

But let me think: we can also try to use a word that has T in a different position than we are considering? We are considering positions 1,3,4. We can test T in position 3, for example, without duplicates.

But we couldn't find a common word without duplicates for T in position 3. So let's stick with T in position 1 or 4.

Another candidate: ""DOUBT"" -> D, O, U, B, T. Pattern: D O U B T. 
- This has T at the end? But in the feedback for ""moist"", T was at the end and got a '-', meaning T is not at position 5. So if we put T at position 5 again, we know it will be wrong. But we are trying to find the position of T. So ""doubt"" has T at position 5, which we know is incorrect. So that would be a waste? Because we know T is not at position 5, so we shouldn't put it there.

Therefore, we must avoid putting T at position 5.

So ""doubt"" is invalid because it places T at position 5, which we know is wrong.

Similarly, we must avoid putting T at position 2 because that is O.

So we are left with positions 1, 3, 4.

Now, let's choose between ""tough"" and ""pouty"". Both are valid and common.

We can also consider ""BOUGH"" (B, O, U, G, H) -> but this does not contain T. We know T is in the word, so if we guess ""bough"", we might not get information about T. However, we can still use it to test other letters.

But if we guess ""bough"", and the secret word has T, then we will get feedback that we are missing T? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. So if we guess ""bough"", we will get:
  - B: ? 
  - O: ✓ (fixed at position 2)
  - U: ? 
  - G: ? 
  - H: ?

And we won't get any information about T because we didn't guess it. But we already know T is in the word, so we don't need to confirm that. However, we don't know the position of T. So if we don't include T, we won't learn where it is.

Therefore, it's better to include T in our guess to narrow down its position.

So we go back to including T.

Now, between ""tough"" and ""pouty"", which one? 

We can also consider ""GOUTY"" (G, O, U, T, Y) which is similar to ""pouty"" but with G instead of P.

But let's pick one that uses more common consonants. 

I think ""tough"" is a good choice because it uses G and H, which are common.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position we are unsure about. We have two possibilities: T at 1 or T at 4 (or 3, but we don't have a good word without duplicates). 

We can try to test T at position 1 with ""tough"". If the feedback shows T as ✓, then we know T is at position 1. If not, then T must be at position 3 or 4. But if we get T as 'x', that would be a problem because we know T is in the word. But in ""tough"", T is at position 1, so if the secret word has T at position 1, we get ✓. If T is at position 3 or 4, then we would get T as '-' (because it's in the word but not at position 1). But we know T is in the word, so it cannot be 'x'. So we will either get ✓ or '-'.

Similarly, if we choose ""pouty"", T is at position 4. Then we will get either ✓ (if T is at position 4) or '-' (if T is at position 1 or 3).

So both are valid.

But note: if we choose ""tough"" and T is not at position 1, we get T as '-', and we still don't know if it's at 3 or 4. Similarly, if we choose ""pouty"" and T is not at 4, we get T as '-' and we don't know if it's at 1 or 3.

So we might need another guess to disambiguate.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in position 3? But we don't have a common word without duplicates. 

What about ""BOUTS""? But S is excluded. Invalid.

""DOUTT""? Not a word.

""LOUTY""? Not common, but L, O, U, T, Y -> valid? But ""louty"" is not a common word. We should stick to common words.

Another idea: ""THUMB"" -> T, H, U, M, B -> but M is excluded (from ""moist"" feedback: M was x). So invalid.

""LOTUS"" -> L, O, T, U, S -> but S is excluded. Invalid.

So we are limited.

Therefore, I think we should go with ""tough"" or ""pouty"". Let's choose ""tough"" because it uses G and H, which are common.

So guess: ""tough""

But let me check: the pattern is T O U G H.

We know O is at position 2, so that's fixed.

If the secret word is ""tough"", we get it right. Otherwise, we get feedback.

But the secret word might be something else, like ""pouty"" or ""gouty"", but we are guessing ""tough"".

We are on the third guess, so we have room.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't fix T to one position but tests multiple possibilities? But that's hard.

Another candidate: ""PUTTY"" -> but duplicate T and we avoid duplicates.

I think ""tough"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with ""tough"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E not in the word).
- ""moist"" showed:
  - O is correct and in position 2 (so the secret word is `_ O _ _ _`).
  - T is in the word but not in position 5 (since it received `-`).
  - M, I, S are not in the word.

The secret word must:
- Have O as the second letter.
- Contain T, but not in position 5 (positions 1, 3, or 4 are possible).
- Exclude C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

For the next guess, ""tough"" is chosen because:
- It tests T in position 1 (to check if T is in position 1).
- It uses new common letters (U, G, H) to gather more information.
- It avoids all excluded letters and fits the pattern `_ O _ _ _`.

<guess>tough</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)
Guess 3: tough -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(✓) U(x) G(x) H(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

1. **crane**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these.
2. **moist**: 
   - M: absent (x)
   - O: correct and in position (✓) — so the second letter is O.
   - I: absent (x)
   - S: absent (x)
   - T: present but wrong position (-) — so T is in the word, but not at position 5.
3. **tough**:
   - T: present but wrong position (-) — so T is in the word, but not at position 1 (since we guessed it at position 1 and got '-'). 
   - O: correct and in position (✓) — confirms second letter is O.
   - U: absent (x) — not in the word.
   - G: absent (x) — not in the word.
   - H: absent (x) — not in the word.

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ O _ _ _
- The word contains the letter T, but not in position 1 or 5 (from ""moist"" and ""tough"").
- Therefore, T must be in position 3 or 4.

Additionally, the following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, U, G, H.

We need to avoid these letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, M, N, R, S, U.

Available letters: B, D, F, K, L, O, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. (Note: O is fixed at position 2, and T is in the word at position 3 or 4.)

The secret word pattern: [letter1] O [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

With T in position 3 or 4.

We must form a word with the available letters and the constraints.

Let's consider the two cases:

**Case 1: T in position 3**
Pattern: _ O T _ _

The word would be: ? O T ? ?

We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with letters from the available set (B, D, F, K, L, P, V, W, X, Y, Z) and avoid the excluded letters.

Possible words:
- BOT??
  - We need two more letters. But note: we have excluded many letters. 
  - Example: BOTHY? But H is excluded. 
  - BOTTY? But T is repeated? And Y is allowed. However, we don't know if T is repeated. But in previous feedback, we only know one T is present. But the word could have two T's? We have to consider.

But let's think of common words:
- ""BOTTY"" is not a common word. 
- ""DOTTY"" has D, O, T, T, Y -> but T is repeated and we have D and Y. However, D is allowed. But is ""dotty"" valid? Yes, but let's see if we can avoid duplicates for more information.

Alternatively, without duplicate T:
- ""DOTED"" -> but E and D? E is excluded. 
- ""BOTEL"" -> E is excluded? And L is allowed, but E is in ""botel""? Actually, ""botel"" is not common; we use ""hotel"" but H is excluded.

Another idea: ""LOTTE"" -> E excluded.

It's hard to find a word without duplicates and without excluded letters.

**Case 2: T in position 4**
Pattern: _ O _ T _

The word would be: ? O ? T ?

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with available letters.

Possible words:
- P O ? T Y -> ""POUTY"" (P, O, U, T, Y) but U is excluded (from ""tough"" feedback: U was x). So invalid.
- G O ? T Y -> ""GOUTY"" (G, O, U, T, Y) but U is excluded and G is excluded (from ""tough"": G was x). So invalid.
- F O ? T ? -> e.g., ""FORTY"" but R is excluded (from ""crane"": R was x). 
- W O ? T ? -> ""WOMAN"" but M and A are excluded? A and M are excluded. 
- ""VOLTY""? Not a word.

What about ""BOOTY""? But that has two O's? Pattern: B O O T Y -> but we have O at position 2, and if we put O at position 3, that would be a duplicate O. But we don't know if O is duplicated? The feedback for ""moist"" had O at position 2 and it was correct, but we don't know about other positions. However, in ""moist"", we only had one O, so we don't know.

But ""BOOTY"": B, O, O, T, Y. 
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 3: O (which is a duplicate)
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: Y

But we have to check if O can be duplicated? The feedback doesn't say anything against duplicates. So it's possible.

But we have to avoid excluded letters: B is allowed, O is allowed (but we know it's in the word), T is allowed, Y is allowed. And no excluded letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, M, N, R, S, U are excluded. So ""BOOTY"" is a candidate.

But note: in ""moist"", we had O at position 2 and it was correct. If the word has another O, we don't know. But in ""booty"", we have O at position 3. So if we guess ""booty"", we can get information about that.

Another candidate: ""DOZTY""? Not a word.

""POOTY""? Not common.

""TOWZY""? Not common.

But ""BOOTY"" is a common word.

Alternatively, ""LOOTY""? Not common.

Another idea: ""BOWAT""? Not a word.

Given the constraints, ""BOOTY"" seems a valid candidate.

But let's check the T position: in ""BOOTY"", T is at position 4. And we know T must be in position 3 or 4, so position 4 is possible.

Also, we have not tried B, O (duplicate), T, Y. We know O is in the word, but we don't know about duplicate O. We know T is in the word. B and Y are new.

But we have to consider: if the secret word has duplicate O, that's fine. But we are testing it.

Another candidate: ""BOLTY""? Not a word.

""BOTFLY""? 6 letters.

So ""BOOTY"" is a possibility.

But we also have the case for T in position 3. We need to cover that as well.

We can try a word that has T in position 3 and uses available letters.

For example, ""LOTAS""? Not a word, and S excluded.

""KOTOW""? K, O, T, O, W -> but duplicate O? Pattern: K O T O W. This has T at position 3. And letters: K, O, T, O, W. Excluded letters? K is allowed, O is known, T is known, W is allowed. And no excluded letters. ""Kotow"" is a word (variant of kowtow, but it can be 5 letters? Kotow is accepted as a word in some dictionaries).

But let's see: ""kotow"" means to bow, and it's valid.

So we have two candidates for the two cases:
- For T in position 3: ""KOTOW"" (K O T O W)
- For T in position 4: ""BOOTY"" (B O O T Y)

But we don't know which case is true. We need to choose one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't assume T's position but tests multiple possibilities? But that might be hard.

We know T is in position 3 or 4. We can choose a word that has T in position 3 and also tests other letters, or in position 4.

But we have to pick one.

We can also consider: we have not tried many letters. We should try to cover more new letters.

In ""BOOTY"": new letters are B, O (duplicate), T (known), Y. But we are testing duplicate O and T at position 4.

In ""KOTOW"": new letters K, O (duplicate), T (known), W. Testing T at position 3 and duplicate O.

But note: we are on the fourth guess. We have 3 guesses left (since we started with 6).

We can also consider a word that doesn't have T? But we know T is in the word, so we should use that. However, if we don't include T, we might not get information about its position, but we can test other letters. But we are limited on guesses.

But let's think: if we guess a word without T, and it turns out T is in the word (which it is), we won't get any new info on T. So it's better to include T to resolve its position.

So we have to choose between T in position 3 or 4.

How to decide? We can look at frequency or just pick one.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has T in position 3 and also has a letter that can be in position 4 or 5 to cover more ground.

But let's list all possible words that fit.

Given the constraints, the possible words might be few.

We can try:

- T in position 3: words like ? O T ? ? with available letters: B, D, F, K, L, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but T is at 3, so for other positions: 1,4,5)

  - B O T ? ? -> BOTCH (C,H excluded), BOTHY (H excluded), BOTTY (duplicate T, but allowed? and Y -> ""botty"" is not common)
  - D O T ? ? -> DOTED (E excluded), DOTTY (duplicate T, Y)
  - F O T ? ? -> FOTCH? not a word
  - K O T ? ? -> KOTOW (K O T O W) -> valid
  - L O T ? ? -> LOTAS (S excluded), LOTTE (E excluded), LOTTO (duplicate T, O) -> ""lotto"" is valid, but O is duplicate and T duplicate? Pattern: L O T T O. But we have O at position 2 and 5? And T at 3 and 4? But we know T is in the word, but we don't know about duplicates. ""LOTTO"" has two T's and two O's. But we are avoiding duplicates? We can try, but it might not be efficient.

- T in position 4: ? O ? T ? 
  - B O ? T Y -> ""BOOTY"" (B O O T Y) or ""BORTY"" (but R excluded), ""BOTTY"" (T duplicate, but if we put T at 4 and 5? ""BOTTY"" has T at 3 and 4? No, ""botty"" is B O T T Y, so T at 3 and 4. But we are considering T at 4 only? In this case, for position 4, we want T at 4, so the word is ? O ? T Y. For example, ""BOOTY"" has O at 3 and T at 4. Or ""POUTY"" but U excluded. 
  - D O ? T Y -> ""DOTTY"" has T at 3 and 4, not at 4 alone. ""DOWTY""? Not a word.
  - F O ? T Y -> ""FORTY"" R excluded.
  - K O ? T Y -> ""KOTY""? Not 5 letters.
  - L O ? T Y -> ""LOTTY"" has T at 3 and 4? ""LOTTY"" is L O T T Y -> T at 3 and 4. But we want T only at 4? Then we need a word with no T at 3. For example, ""LOFTY"" -> L, O, F, T, Y. But F is allowed. Pattern: L O F T Y. This has T at position 4. And no duplicate T. And letters: L, O, F, T, Y. All allowed? Excluded letters: none of the excluded. So ""LOFTY"" is a valid word.

Oh! ""LOFTY"" is a great candidate for T in position 4.

Similarly, for T in position 3, we have ""KOTOW"".

But ""LOFTY"" has T at position 4, which is one of the possibilities.

And it uses new letters: L, F, T, Y (O is fixed).

So let's consider ""LOFTY"".

Pattern: L O F T Y

- Position 1: L
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 3: F
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: Y

This avoids all excluded letters and tests T at position 4.

If T is indeed at position 4, we might get T as correct. If not, then T must be at position 3.

Moreover, we test L, F, and Y.

So this seems a good guess.

Similarly, we could test T at position 3 with a word like ""KOTOW"", but ""LOFTY"" uses more common letters? F and L are common.

But let's compare:

- ""LOFTY"": tests L, F, T, Y (and O)
- ""KOTOW"": tests K, T, O (duplicate), W

We have not tried L, F, Y, K, W. Both are good.

But ""LOFTY"" is a more common word.

Also, if we guess ""LOFTY"" and T is not at position 4, we know T must be at position 3, and we can focus on that in the next guess.

Similarly, if we get feedback that T is at position 4, then we might be close to the word.

So I think ""LOFTY"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""LOFTY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are not in the word.
- **Guess 2 (moist)**:
  - O is correct and in position 2 (✓), confirming the pattern `_ O _ _ _`.
  - T is present but in the wrong position (-), so T is in the word but not at position 5.
  - M, I, S are absent (x).
- **Guess 3 (tough)**:
  - T is present but in the wrong position (-), so T is not at position 1 (and not at position 5, from Guess 2).
  - O is correct and in position 2 (✓), reaffirming the pattern.
  - U, G, H are absent (x).

### Key Insights:
- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ O _ _ _` (O is the second letter).
- **T Position**: T must be in position 3 or 4 (since it cannot be in 1, 2, or 5).
- **Absent Letters**: A, C, E, G, H, I, M, N, R, S, U (cannot be in the word).
- **Available Letters**: B, D, F, K, L, O, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (O and T are confirmed in the word).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test T in position 4 (since position 3 is also possible, but we need to resolve T's location).
- Use new high-frequency letters (e.g., L, F, Y) to maximize information.
- Avoid absent letters and ensure the word fits the pattern `_ O _ T _` (for T in position 4).

**Chosen Guess: LOFTY**  
- **Why?**  
  - Tests T in position 4: If T is correct (✓), we lock in position 4. If T is present but wrong position (-), it must be in position 3.  
  - Tests new letters: L (position 1), F (position 3), Y (position 5).  
  - Avoids all absent letters and uses common consonants/vowels.  
  - Valid English word (meaning ""high or elevated"").

<guess>lofty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)
Guess 3: tough -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(✓) U(x) G(x) H(x)
Guess 4: lofty -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(✓) F(x) T(✓) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

1. **crane**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these.
2. **moist**: 
   - M: absent (x)
   - O: correct and in position (✓) — so the second letter is O.
   - I: absent (x)
   - S: absent (x)
   - T: present but wrong position (-) — so T is in the word, but not at position 5.
3. **tough**:
   - T: present but wrong position (-) — so T is not at position 1 (and not at position 5 from previous).
   - O: correct and in position (✓) — confirms second letter is O.
   - U: absent (x)
   - G: absent (x)
   - H: absent (x)
4. **lofty**:
   - L: absent (x)
   - O: correct and in position (✓)
   - F: absent (x)
   - T: correct and in position (✓) — so T is at position 4.
   - Y: correct and in position (✓) — so Y is at position 5.

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ O _ T Y
- The word contains T at position 4 and Y at position 5.
- The second letter is O, as before.

Additionally, the following letters are absent: A, C, E, G, H, I, L, M, N, R, S, U, F (from the feedback above).

We need to find the first and third letters. The first letter is unknown, and the third letter is unknown.

Constraints:
- The first letter must be one of the remaining available letters: B, D, K, P, V, W, X, Z (since O, T, Y are used, and we avoid the absent letters).
- The third letter must also be from the available letters, but it can be the same as the first if duplicated? However, we don't have information about duplicates yet.

But note: the word is _ O _ T Y, so positions 1 and 3 are open.

Available letters (not absent and not yet placed): B, D, K, P, V, W, X, Z. (Also, note that O, T, Y are already placed, so we don't need to use them again unless duplicated, but we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicates so far, so we might avoid them for now to maximize information.)

We need to form a 5-letter word that fits the pattern and uses the available letters.

Possible words:
- The word must end with ""OTTY""? No, the pattern is _ O _ T Y, so the last three are fixed as O, ?, T, Y? Actually, the pattern is:
  Position 1: unknown
  Position 2: O
  Position 3: unknown
  Position 4: T
  Position 5: Y

So the word is: [letter1] O [letter3] T Y

We need to choose letter1 and letter3 from the available letters: B, D, K, P, V, W, X, Z.

Now, what words fit this pattern?

Let's try:
- B O ? T Y: 
  - B O D T Y -> ""BODTY"" not a word.
  - B O K T Y -> ""BOKTY"" not a word.
  - B O P T Y -> ""BOPTY"" not a word.
  - B O W T Y -> ""BOWTY"" not a word.

- D O ? T Y:
  - D O B T Y -> ""DOBTY"" not a word.
  - D O K T Y -> ""DOKTY"" not a word.
  - D O P T Y -> ""DOPTY"" not a word.
  - D O W T Y -> ""DOWTY"" not a word.

- K O ? T Y:
  - K O B T Y -> ""KOBTY"" not a word.
  - K O D T Y -> ""KODTY"" not a word.
  - K O P T Y -> ""KOPTY"" not a word. (But ""kempt"" is a word but has E and M, which are excluded, and pattern doesn't match.)
  - K O W T Y -> ""KOWTY"" not a word.

- P O ? T Y:
  - P O B T Y -> ""POBTY"" not a word.
  - P O D T Y -> ""PODTY"" not a word.
  - P O K T Y -> ""POKTY"" not a word.
  - P O W T Y -> ""POWTY"" not a word. But ""pouty"" is a word but has U (excluded) and pattern: P O U T Y, which would be position 3 as U, but U is excluded.

- V O ? T Y:
  - V O B T Y -> ""VOBTY"" not a word.
  - V O D T Y -> ""VODTY"" not a word.
  - V O K T Y -> ""VOKTY"" not a word.
  - V O W T Y -> ""VOWTY"" not a word.

- W O ? T Y:
  - W O B T Y -> ""WOBTY"" not a word.
  - W O D T Y -> ""WODTY"" not a word.
  - W O K T Y -> ""WOKTY"" not a word. But ""wok"" is a word, but not 5 letters.
  - W O P T Y -> ""WOPTY"" not a word.

- X O ? T Y: Unlikely, e.g., ""XOFTY"" not a word.

- Z O ? T Y: 
  - Z O B T Y -> ""ZOBTY"" not a word.
  - etc.

This is problematic. None of these combinations form a word.

Perhaps we missed some available letters? We have B, D, K, P, V, W, X, Z. But maybe we can consider that the third letter might be a vowel? The only vowel we have left is not available because A, E, I, O, U are all excluded? O is in the word but already used at position 2. We don't have other vowels? The available vowels are none because A, E, I, U are excluded. So the third letter must be a consonant from the available set.

But we can't form a word. What's wrong?

Perhaps we have a duplicate letter? For example, maybe the word has two T's? But T is at position 4, and we have position 3 open. Could T be at position 3? But in the feedback for ""lofty"", we have T at position 4 marked as correct (✓). And in the pattern, position 3 is a different letter.

But in ""lofty"", we have:
  L(x) O(✓) F(x) T(✓) Y(✓)

So T is at position 4 and correct. So the secret word has T at position 4. Therefore, position 3 cannot be T? Unless the word has two T's? But in ""lofty"", we only provided one T (at position 4), so if there is a T at position 3, we wouldn't know because we didn't guess it. So it's possible that there is a T at position 3? But we have T at position 4, so if there is a T at position 3, then the word has two T's.

But in the feedback for ""moist"", we had T at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That T could be the same T as at position 4? But in ""moist"", T was at position 5, and in the secret word, T is at position 4, so that's why it was marked as present but wrong position. If there were two T's, we might have gotten an additional indication? But in ""moist"", we only had one T, so we only got one '-' for T. Similarly, in ""tough"", we had T at position 1 and got '-', which could be for the T at position 4 (or 3 if duplicated). But we don't have evidence for or against duplicates.

So perhaps the secret word has two T's? Then position 3 could be T.

But the pattern from ""lofty"" feedback: T is at position 4 and Y at 5, so the word is _ O _ T Y. If position 3 is T, then the word is _ O T T Y.

Is that possible? Then the word would be ? O T T Y.

Now, what words fit ? O T T Y? 
- B O T T Y -> ""BOTTY"" not a common word, but ""botty"" is informal for buttocks? It might be accepted in some dictionaries.
- P O T T Y -> ""POTTY"" is a common word (a small pot for children or a slang for crazy).

Similarly, ""dotty"" is D O T T Y, but D is available? But we have to check if D is allowed. D is not in the absent list, so it's available.

So possible words: ""POTTY"", ""BOTTY"", ""DOTTY"", etc.

But in ""lofty"", we guessed F at position 3 and it was absent. If the secret word is ""POTTY"", then position 3 is T, which we didn't guess in ""lofty"", so we got F as absent, which is correct.

Similarly, in ""moist"", we had T at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. In ""POTTY"", T is at positions 3 and 4, so the T at position 5 in ""moist"" would match one of the T's? But the feedback only marks one T? In ""moist"", we provided one T, so it would match one occurrence. Since position 5 is not a T (it's Y in ""POTTY""? No, ""POTTY"" is P O T T Y, so position 5 is Y, not T. So the T at position 5 in ""moist"" is not in the word at position 5, but it is in the word at positions 3 or 4. So the '-' is correct.

Similarly, in ""tough"", we had T at position 1 and got '-', which is correct because T is at 3 and 4.

So ""POTTY"" is a candidate.

But we have to check the absent letters: P is not absent, O is present, T is present, T again, Y is present. And no excluded letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, L, M, N, R, S, U, F are excluded. So P is allowed.

Similarly, ""DOTTY"" (D O T T Y) is also a candidate, with D.

""BOTTY"" (B O T T Y) is less common.

Now, what about the first letter? In ""POTTY"", it's P. In ""DOTTY"", it's D. In ""BOTTY"", it's B.

We need to choose one.

But we have only two guesses left (since we are on the fifth guess, and we started with 6). We can guess one of these.

But note: we also have to consider if there are words without duplicate T? But we couldn't find any. So likely, the word has duplicate T.

Therefore, the word is ? O T T Y, with the first letter being one of B, D, P.

We can try to guess ""POTTY"" because it's the most common.

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

What if the word is not with duplicate T? Then what could it be? We couldn't find any word without duplicate T that fits the pattern and avoids excluded letters.

So we must go with the duplicate T.

Therefore, we guess ""POTTY"".

But in ""POTTY"", we have T at position 3 and 4. In the feedback for ""lofty"", we only got T marked at position 4, but not at position 3 because we didn't guess it. So it's consistent.

So I think ""POTTY"" is the most likely.

But to be thorough, let's see if there is a word with a different letter at position 3.

For example, is there a word like ? O D T Y? But we couldn't find any. Similarly for other letters.

So we go with ""POTTY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ O _ T Y` (positions 2, 4, and 5 are fixed as O, T, Y).
- **Absent Letters**: A, C, E, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, R, S, U (cannot be in the word).
- **Available Letters for Positions 1 and 3**: B, D, K, P, V, W, X, Z.

### Analysis:
- No valid words were found without duplicate letters (e.g., `? O ? T Y` with distinct letters), suggesting the possibility of duplicate `T` at position 3.
- Words like **POTTY** (P O T T Y), **DOTTY** (D O T T Y), or **BOTTY** (B O T T Y) fit the pattern and use available letters.
- **POTTY** is the most common English word among these options.

### Next Guess: POTTY
- Tests if the word is **POTTY** (if correct, we win).
- If incorrect, feedback will confirm if `P` is in the word and provide info on position 3 (likely `T`).

<guess>potty</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we can deduce the following:

1. **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ O _ T Y` (O in position 2, T in position 4, Y in position 5).
2. **Absent Letters**: A, C, E, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, R, S, U (all marked ""x"" in previous feedback).
3. **Available Letters for Positions 1 and 3**: B, D, K, P, V, W, X, Z (since O, T, Y are already placed).

### Key Insight:
- No common English words fit `_ O _ T Y` without duplicate letters (e.g., `? O ? T Y` with distinct letters). This suggests the secret word likely has a **duplicate T** at position 3 (e.g., `? O T T Y`).
- Possible words include **POTTY**, **DOTTY**, or **BOTTY**. Among these, **POTTY** is the most common and likely candidate.

### Next Guess: POTTY
- **Why?**  
  - Tests `P` at position 1 and `T` at position 3 (duplicate).  
  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback will confirm if `P` is present and provide more clues for position 1.

Also, it\'s a common word.\n\n However, let\'s check frequency of letters:\n   After removing C,R,A,N,E, high frequency letters are O, I, S, T, L, U, B, D, G, H, M, P.\n\n ""MOIST"" covers O, I, S, T, M. That\'s good.\n\n Alternatively ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D -> also good.\n\n But note: we have only 6 tries and we want maximum information. ""MOIST"" has two vowels (O,I) and three consonants, which is balanced.\n\n Another candidate: ""POINT"" (P, O, I, N, T) but N is already excluded? Wait, no: N was excluded, so N cannot be used. So ""POINT"" is invalid because it contains N? Let me see:\n   Our first guess feedback said N(x), meaning there is no N. So we must avoid N.\n\n Therefore, ""POINT"" contains N -> invalid.\n\n So words we can use: ""MOIST"", ""BUILD"", ""GHOUL"", ""SPLIT"", etc.\n\n Considering ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T -> these are all new and avoid banned letters.\n\n Similarly, ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> also good.\n\n Which word? ""SOUTH"" (S, O, U, T, H) is another candidate.\n\n I think ""MOIST"" and ""SPLIT"" are both strong because they have S and T which are very common.\n\n Let me pick ""MOIST"" for this guess.\n\n Alternatively, we can pick ""GHOUL"" but it has G, H, O, U, L which are less common and U is less frequent. But avoiding previously tried letters is necessary.\n\n Since ""MOIST"" uses 5 letters that are all high frequency and we haven\'t tried, it should be good.\n\n So, I\'ll guess ""MOIST"".After the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", we know that the letters **C, R, A, N, and E** are **not in the secret word**. Therefore, we need a new guess that avoids these letters entirely and tests new common letters.\n\nHigh-value letters to try next include **O, I, S, T, M** (common vowels and consonants not yet tested). The word **""moist""** uses these letters and is a valid English 5-letter word. This guess will help gather new information about the secret word.\n\n<guess>moist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n1. ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as \'x\', meaning none of these letters are in the secret word.\n2. ""moist"": \n   - M: x (not in the word)\n   - O: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, so the second letter of the secret word is O)\n   - I: x (not in the word)\n   - S: x (not in the word)\n   - T: - (in the word but in the wrong position)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word has the letter O in the second position: _ O _ _ _\n- The secret word contains the letter T, but not in the last position (since in ""moist"" it was at the end and got a \'-\', meaning it\'s present but not at the end).\n- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.\n\nAlso, note that T is in the word but not at the end. Since the second position is O, T must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait, in ""moist"", T was in position 5 and got a \'-\', meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So T must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nHowever, we must avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Has O as the second letter.\n- Contains T, but not at the end (so not in position 5) and not in position 2 (which is O).\n- Avoids the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.\n\nPossible positions for T: 1, 3, or 4.\n\nWe also need to choose other letters that are not in the excluded set. The available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and T, but we are using T once, and O is fixed at position 2).\n\nWe should try to cover more common letters to maximize information.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit the pattern: [letter1] O [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]\n\nWith T being in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.\n\nOption 1: T in position 1 -> T O _ _ _\nOption 2: T in position 3 -> _ O T _ _\nOption 3: T in position 4 -> _ O _ T _\n\nWe also know that the word must contain T and O (and O is fixed at position 2).\n\nLet\'s consider common words:\n\nFor T in position 1: \n  - TOUCH? But C is excluded -> invalid.\n  - TOUGH? G and H are allowed. Pattern: T O U G H -> but we have U, G, H. Also, we haven\'t tried U, G, H. So ""tough"" is a candidate.\n\nFor T in position 3:\n  - _ O T _ _ : e.g., ""MOTEL"" -> but M and E are excluded. \n  - ""POTTY"" -> P, O, T, T, Y -> but T is repeated? And we don\'t know if T is repeated. Also, Y is allowed. However, we have two T\'s? The feedback for ""moist"" had only one T and it was marked as present. But the secret word might have two T\'s? We don\'t know. But in ""moist"" we only had one T, and it was marked as present, so at least one T. But the word could have more.\n\nBut we must avoid S, which is in ""potty""? No, ""potty"" has no S. But we have to check the letters: P, O, T, T, Y. Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S -> none of these, so it\'s allowed. However, we have two T\'s. But the feedback for ""moist"" only told us about one T? Actually, the feedback per letter: in ""moist"", the T was at the end and marked as present. If the word had two T\'s, we might have gotten more feedback? But in ""moist"" we only provided one T, so we don\'t know about duplicates. So ""potty"" is a possibility.\n\nBut let\'s look for more common words.\n\nAnother option for T in position 3: ""BOTCH"" -> but C is excluded. ""DOTTY"" -> D, O, T, T, Y -> again, two T\'s.\n\nFor T in position 4: _ O _ T _\n  - e.g., ""FORTY"" -> but F, O, R, T, Y -> R is excluded (from first guess: R was x). So invalid.\n  - ""POUTY"" -> P, O, U, T, Y -> no excluded letters? P, O, U, T, Y: O is fixed, P, U, T, Y are allowed. So ""pouty"" is a candidate.\n\nBut note: we have T in position 4. And in ""moist"", T was at position 5 and was marked as present but wrong position. So if T is at position 4 in the secret word, then in ""moist"" (which had T at position 5) we would get a \'-\' for T, which we did. So that matches.\n\nNow, we have two strong candidates: \n  - ""tough"" (T at position 1)\n  - ""pouty"" (T at position 4)\n\nBut we also have the option of T at position 3, e.g., ""potty"", but that has two T\'s. We don\'t know if the word has two T\'s, so we might get less information if we guess a word with duplicate letters. It\'s better to avoid duplicates to cover more letters.\n\nSo let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\nTherefore, ""tough"" and ""pouty"" both have unique letters.\n\n""tough"": T, O, U, G, H -> letters: T, O, U, G, H. We know O is fixed at position 2. So the word is T O U G H.\n\n""pouty"": P, O, U, T, Y -> P, O, U, T, Y. Pattern: P O U T Y.\n\nWhich one to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nWe have not tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBoth words use U. ""tough"" uses T, U, G, H. ""pouty"" uses P, U, T, Y.\n\nWe already know T is in the word, so we don\'t need to test T again? But we are including T to confirm its position. However, we are forced to include T because we know it\'s in the word.\n\nBut we can choose a word that doesn\'t have T? No, because we must include T? Actually, we don\'t have to, but we know T is in the word, so if we don\'t include T, we might not get information about its position. But we are trying to find the word, so we should use the information we have.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has T and also other new letters.\n\nBut both words are valid.\n\nAnother idea: we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has O, and we haven\'t tried U (which is a vowel). Both words have U.\n\nBut we also know that the word does not have A, E, I (from previous feedback). So the only vowels left are O (which we have) and U. So the word might have U.\n\nWe can also consider words without U? But we don\'t have to.\n\nLet\'s list more words without duplicates and without excluded letters:\n\nPattern: _ O _ _ _\n\nWith T in the word, but not at position 2 or 5? Actually, in the feedback for ""moist"", T was at position 5 and got a \'-\', meaning T is in the word but not at position 5. So T can be at 1, 3, or 4.\n\nWords with T at 1: \n  - TOUCH (invalid: C)\n  - TOUGH (valid: T, O, U, G, H)\n  - TOUR? (5 letters? no, tour is 4)\n  - TOUTS (invalid: S) -> S is excluded.\n  - TOUZY? (not common, and Z and Y are less common)\n\nWords with T at 3:\n  - _ O T _ _ : \n      - BOTCH (invalid: C)\n      - DOTAL (invalid: A) -> A is excluded.\n      - DOTED (invalid: E and D? D is allowed, but E is excluded) -> E is excluded.\n      - GOTHS (invalid: S) -> S excluded.\n      - LOTTE (invalid: E) -> E excluded.\n      - MOTHS (invalid: M and S) -> M and S excluded.\n      - NOTCH (invalid: N and C) -> N and C excluded.\n      - POTTY (valid, but duplicate T) -> we avoid duplicates for now.\n      - ROTCH (invalid: R and C) -> R excluded.\n      - WOT? (not 5 letters)\n\n  So few options without duplicates? Actually, ""POTTY"" is one, but duplicates.\n\nWords with T at 4:\n  - _ O _ T _ :\n      - FORTH (invalid: R) -> R excluded.\n      - FORTY (invalid: R) -> R excluded.\n      - POUTY (valid: P, O, U, T, Y) -> no duplicates, and no excluded letters.\n      - DOUTY? (not common, but D, O, U, T, Y -> valid, but we prefer common words)\n      - GOUTY (valid: G, O, U, T, Y) -> same as pouty but with G instead of P.\n\nSo we have:\n  - TOUGH (T at 1)\n  - POUTY (T at 4)\n  - GOUTY (T at 4) \n\nWe can also consider other words without T? But we know T is in the word, so we should include it to get position information.\n\nBut we don\'t have to include T in every guess? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient. Since we know T is in the word, we can try to find its position.\n\nGiven that, let\'s choose between ""tough"" and ""pouty"".\n\nWe want to cover more new letters. \n- ""tough"": uses T, O, U, G, H -> new letters: U, G, H (T and O we already know about, but O is fixed and T is known to be present).\n- ""pouty"": uses P, O, U, T, Y -> new letters: P, U, Y.\n\nWe haven\'t tried U, G, H, P, Y. Both are good.\n\nBut note: we have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We want to maximize information.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have T? But that might not help us locate T. However, if we don\'t include T, we might not get information about its position, but we can test other letters. But we know T is in the word, so we can use that to our advantage by including it.\n\nBut let me think: we can also try to use a word that has T in a different position than we are considering? We are considering positions 1,3,4. We can test T in position 3, for example, without duplicates.\n\nBut we couldn\'t find a common word without duplicates for T in position 3. So let\'s stick with T in position 1 or 4.\n\nAnother candidate: ""DOUBT"" -> D, O, U, B, T. Pattern: D O U B T. \n- This has T at the end? But in the feedback for ""moist"", T was at the end and got a \'-\', meaning T is not at position 5. So if we put T at position 5 again, we know it will be wrong. But we are trying to find the position of T. So ""doubt"" has T at position 5, which we know is incorrect. So that would be a waste? Because we know T is not at position 5, so we shouldn\'t put it there.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid putting T at position 5.\n\nSo ""doubt"" is invalid because it places T at position 5, which we know is wrong.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid putting T at position 2 because that is O.\n\nSo we are left with positions 1, 3, 4.\n\nNow, let\'s choose between ""tough"" and ""pouty"". Both are valid and common.\n\nWe can also consider ""BOUGH"" (B, O, U, G, H) -> but this does not contain T. We know T is in the word, so if we guess ""bough"", we might not get information about T. However, we can still use it to test other letters.\n\nBut if we guess ""bough"", and the secret word has T, then we will get feedback that we are missing T? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. So if we guess ""bough"", we will get:\n  - B: ? \n  - O: ✓ (fixed at position 2)\n  - U: ? \n  - G: ? \n  - H: ?\n\nAnd we won\'t get any information about T because we didn\'t guess it. But we already know T is in the word, so we don\'t need to confirm that. However, we don\'t know the position of T. So if we don\'t include T, we won\'t learn where it is.\n\nTherefore, it\'s better to include T in our guess to narrow down its position.\n\nSo we go back to including T.\n\nNow, between ""tough"" and ""pouty"", which one? \n\nWe can also consider ""GOUTY"" (G, O, U, T, Y) which is similar to ""pouty"" but with G instead of P.\n\nBut let\'s pick one that uses more common consonants. \n\nI think ""tough"" is a good choice because it uses G and H, which are common.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position we are unsure about. We have two possibilities: T at 1 or T at 4 (or 3, but we don\'t have a good word without duplicates). \n\nWe can try to test T at position 1 with ""tough"". If the feedback shows T as ✓, then we know T is at position 1. If not, then T must be at position 3 or 4. But if we get T as \'x\', that would be a problem because we know T is in the word. But in ""tough"", T is at position 1, so if the secret word has T at position 1, we get ✓. If T is at position 3 or 4, then we would get T as \'-\' (because it\'s in the word but not at position 1). But we know T is in the word, so it cannot be \'x\'. So we will either get ✓ or \'-\'.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose ""pouty"", T is at position 4. Then we will get either ✓ (if T is at position 4) or \'-\' (if T is at position 1 or 3).\n\nSo both are valid.\n\nBut note: if we choose ""tough"" and T is not at position 1, we get T as \'-\', and we still don\'t know if it\'s at 3 or 4. Similarly, if we choose ""pouty"" and T is not at 4, we get T as \'-\' and we don\'t know if it\'s at 1 or 3.\n\nSo we might need another guess to disambiguate.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has T in position 3? But we don\'t have a common word without duplicates. \n\nWhat about ""BOUTS""? But S is excluded. Invalid.\n\n""DOUTT""? Not a word.\n\n""LOUTY""? Not common, but L, O, U, T, Y -> valid? But ""louty"" is not a common word. We should stick to common words.\n\nAnother idea: ""THUMB"" -> T, H, U, M, B -> but M is excluded (from ""moist"" feedback: M was x). So invalid.\n\n""LOTUS"" -> L, O, T, U, S -> but S is excluded. Invalid.\n\nSo we are limited.\n\nTherefore, I think we should go with ""tough"" or ""pouty"". Let\'s choose ""tough"" because it uses G and H, which are common.\n\nSo guess: ""tough""\n\nBut let me check: the pattern is T O U G H.\n\nWe know O is at position 2, so that\'s fixed.\n\nIf the secret word is ""tough"", we get it right. Otherwise, we get feedback.\n\nBut the secret word might be something else, like ""pouty"" or ""gouty"", but we are guessing ""tough"".\n\nWe are on the third guess, so we have room.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t fix T to one position but tests multiple possibilities? But that\'s hard.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PUTTY"" -> but duplicate T and we avoid duplicates.\n\nI think ""tough"" is a good choice.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""tough"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E not in the word).\n- ""moist"" showed:\n  - O is correct and in position 2 (so the secret word is `_ O _ _ _`).\n  - T is in the word but not in position 5 (since it received `-`).\n  - M, I, S are not in the word.\n\nThe secret word must:\n- Have O as the second letter.\n- Contain T, but not in position 5 (positions 1, 3, or 4 are possible).\n- Exclude C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.\n\nFor the next guess, ""tough"" is chosen because:\n- It tests T in position 1 (to check if T is in position 1).\n- It uses new common letters (U, G, H) to gather more information.\n- It avoids all excluded letters and fits the pattern `_ O _ _ _`.\n\n<guess>tough</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)\nGuess 3: tough -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(✓) U(x) G(x) H(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback from previous guesses:\n\n1. **crane**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x).

(Note: O is fixed at position 2, and T is in the word at position 3 or 4.)\n\nThe secret word pattern: [letter1] O [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]\n\nWith T in position 3 or 4.\n\nWe must form a word with the available letters and the constraints.\n\nLet\'s consider the two cases:\n\n**Case 1: T in position 3**\nPattern: _ O T _ _\n\nThe word would be: ? O T ? ?\n\nWe need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with letters from the available set (B, D, F, K, L, P, V, W, X, Y, Z) and avoid the excluded letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- BOT??\n  - We need two more letters. But note: we have excluded many letters. \n  - Example: BOTHY? But H is excluded. \n  - BOTTY? But T is repeated? And Y is allowed. However, we don\'t know if T is repeated. But in previous feedback, we only know one T is present. But the word could have two T\'s? We have to consider.\n\nBut let\'s think of common words:\n- ""BOTTY"" is not a common word. \n- ""DOTTY"" has D, O, T, T, Y -> but T is repeated and we have D and Y. However, D is allowed. But is ""dotty"" valid? Yes, but let\'s see if we can avoid duplicates for more information.\n\nAlternatively, without duplicate T:\n- ""DOTED"" -> but E and D? E is excluded. \n- ""BOTEL"" -> E is excluded? And L is allowed, but E is in ""botel""? Actually, ""botel"" is not common; we use ""hotel"" but H is excluded.\n\nAnother idea: ""LOTTE"" -> E excluded.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a word without duplicates and without excluded letters.\n\n**Case 2: T in position 4**\nPattern: _ O _ T _\n\nThe word would be: ? O ? T ?\n\nWe need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with available letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- P O ? T Y -> ""POUTY"" (P, O, U, T, Y) but U is excluded (from ""tough"" feedback: U was x). So invalid.\n- G O ? T Y -> ""GOUTY"" (G, O, U, T, Y) but U is excluded and G is excluded (from ""tough"": G was x). So invalid.\n- F O ? T ? -> e.g., ""FORTY"" but R is excluded (from ""crane"": R was x). \n- W O ? T ? -> ""WOMAN"" but M and A are excluded? A and M are excluded. \n- ""VOLTY""? Not a word.\n\nWhat about ""BOOTY""? But that has two O\'s? Pattern: B O O T Y -> but we have O at position 2, and if we put O at position 3, that would be a duplicate O. But we don\'t know if O is duplicated? The feedback for ""moist"" had O at position 2 and it was correct, but we don\'t know about other positions. However, in ""moist"", we only had one O, so we don\'t know.\n\nBut ""BOOTY"": B, O, O, T, Y. \n- Position 1: B\n- Position 2: O (fixed)\n- Position 3: O (which is a duplicate)\n- Position 4: T\n- Position 5: Y\n\nBut we have to check if O can be duplicated? The feedback doesn\'t say anything against duplicates. So it\'s possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid excluded letters: B is allowed, O is allowed (but we know it\'s in the word), T is allowed, Y is allowed. And no excluded letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, M, N, R, S, U are excluded. So ""BOOTY"" is a candidate.\n\nBut note: in ""moist"", we had O at position 2 and it was correct. If the word has another O, we don\'t know. But in ""booty"", we have O at position 3. So if we guess ""booty"", we can get information about that.\n\nAnother candidate: ""DOZTY""? Not a word.\n\n""POOTY""? Not common.\n\n""TOWZY""? Not common.\n\nBut ""BOOTY"" is a common word.\n\nAlternatively, ""LOOTY""? Not common.\n\nAnother idea: ""BOWAT""? Not a word.\n\nGiven the constraints, ""BOOTY"" seems a valid candidate.\n\nBut let\'s check the T position: in ""BOOTY"", T is at position 4. And we know T must be in position 3 or 4, so position 4 is possible.\n\nAlso, we have not tried B, O (duplicate), T, Y. We know O is in the word, but we don\'t know about duplicate O. We know T is in the word. B and Y are new.\n\nBut we have to consider: if the secret word has duplicate O, that\'s fine. But we are testing it.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BOLTY""? Not a word.\n\n""BOTFLY""? 6 letters.\n\nSo ""BOOTY"" is a possibility.\n\nBut we also have the case for T in position 3. We need to cover that as well.\n\nWe can try a word that has T in position 3 and uses available letters.\n\nFor example, ""LOTAS""? Not a word, and S excluded.\n\n""KOTOW""? K, O, T, O, W -> but duplicate O? Pattern: K O T O W. This has T at position 3. And letters: K, O, T, O, W. Excluded letters? K is allowed, O is known, T is known, W is allowed. And no excluded letters. ""Kotow"" is a word (variant of kowtow, but it can be 5 letters? Kotow is accepted as a word in some dictionaries).\n\nBut let\'s see: ""kotow"" means to bow, and it\'s valid.\n\nSo we have two candidates for the two cases:\n- For T in position 3: ""KOTOW"" (K O T O W)\n- For T in position 4: ""BOOTY"" (B O O T Y)\n\nBut we don\'t know which case is true. We need to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t assume T\'s position but tests multiple possibilities? But that might be hard.\n\nWe know T is in position 3 or 4. We can choose a word that has T in position 3 and also tests other letters, or in position 4.\n\nBut we have to pick one.\n\nWe can also consider: we have not tried many letters. We should try to cover more new letters.\n\nIn ""BOOTY"": new letters are B, O (duplicate), T (known), Y. But we are testing duplicate O and T at position 4.\n\nIn ""KOTOW"": new letters K, O (duplicate), T (known), W. Testing T at position 3 and duplicate O.\n\nBut note: we are on the fourth guess. We have 3 guesses left (since we started with 6).\n\nWe can also consider a word that doesn\'t have T? But we know T is in the word, so we should use that. However, if we don\'t include T, we might not get information about its position, but we can test other letters. But we are limited on guesses.\n\nBut let\'s think: if we guess a word without T, and it turns out T is in the word (which it is), we won\'t get any new info on T. So it\'s better to include T to resolve its position.\n\nSo we have to choose between T in position 3 or 4.\n\nHow to decide? We can look at frequency or just pick one.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has T in position 3 and also has a letter that can be in position 4 or 5 to cover more ground.\n\nBut let\'s list all possible words that fit.\n\nGiven the constraints, the possible words might be few.\n\nWe can try:\n\n- T in position 3: words like ? O T ? ? with available letters: B, D, F, K, L, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but T is at 3, so for other positions: 1,4,5)\n\n  - B O T ? ? -> BOTCH (C,H excluded), BOTHY (H excluded), BOTTY (duplicate T, but allowed? and Y -> ""botty"" is not common)\n  - D O T ? ? -> DOTED (E excluded), DOTTY (duplicate T, Y)\n  - F O T ? ? -> FOTCH? not a word\n  - K O T ? ? -> KOTOW (K O T O W) -> valid\n  - L O T ? ? -> LOTAS (S excluded), LOTTE (E excluded), LOTTO (duplicate T, O) -> ""lotto"" is valid, but O is duplicate and T duplicate? Pattern: L O T T O. But we have O at position 2 and 5? And T at 3 and 4? But we know T is in the word, but we don\'t know about duplicates. ""LOTTO"" has two T\'s and two O\'s. But we are avoiding duplicates? We can try, but it might not be efficient.\n\n- T in position 4: ? O ? T ? \n  - B O ? T Y -> ""BOOTY"" (B O O T Y) or ""BORTY"" (but R excluded), ""BOTTY"" (T duplicate, but if we put T at 4 and 5? ""BOTTY"" has T at 3 and 4? No, ""botty"" is B O T T Y, so T at 3 and 4. But we are considering T at 4 only? In this case, for position 4, we want T at 4, so the word is ? O ? T Y. For example, ""BOOTY"" has O at 3 and T at 4. Or ""POUTY"" but U excluded. \n  - D O ? T Y -> ""DOTTY"" has T at 3 and 4, not at 4 alone. ""DOWTY""? Not a word.\n  - F O ? T Y -> ""FORTY"" R excluded.\n  - K O ? T Y -> ""KOTY""? Not 5 letters.\n  - L O ? T Y -> ""LOTTY"" has T at 3 and 4? ""LOTTY"" is L O T T Y -> T at 3 and 4. But we want T only at 4? Then we need a word with no T at 3. For example, ""LOFTY"" -> L, O, F, T, Y. But F is allowed. Pattern: L O F T Y. This has T at position 4. And no duplicate T. And letters: L, O, F, T, Y. All allowed? Excluded letters: none of the excluded. So ""LOFTY"" is a valid word.\n\nOh! ""LOFTY"" is a great candidate for T in position 4.\n\nSimilarly, for T in position 3, we have ""KOTOW"".\n\nBut ""LOFTY"" has T at position 4, which is one of the possibilities.\n\nAnd it uses new letters: L, F, T, Y (O is fixed).\n\nSo let\'s consider ""LOFTY"".\n\nPattern: L O F T Y\n\n- Position 1: L\n- Position 2: O (fixed)\n- Position 3: F\n- Position 4: T\n- Position 5: Y\n\nThis avoids all excluded letters and tests T at position 4.\n\nIf T is indeed at position 4, we might get T as correct. If not, then T must be at position 3.\n\nMoreover, we test L, F, and Y.\n\nSo this seems a good guess.\n\nSimilarly, we could test T at position 3 with a word like ""KOTOW"", but ""LOFTY"" uses more common letters? F and L are common.\n\nBut let\'s compare:\n\n- ""LOFTY"": tests L, F, T, Y (and O)\n- ""KOTOW"": tests K, T, O (duplicate), W\n\nWe have not tried L, F, Y, K, W. Both are good.\n\nBut ""LOFTY"" is a more common word.\n\nAlso, if we guess ""LOFTY"" and T is not at position 4, we know T must be at position 3, and we can focus on that in the next guess.\n\nSimilarly, if we get feedback that T is at position 4, then we might be close to the word.\n\nSo I think ""LOFTY"" is a good choice.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""LOFTY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are not in the word.\n- **Guess 2 (moist)**:\n  - O is correct and in position 2 (✓), confirming the pattern `_ O _ _ _`.\n  - T is present but in the wrong position (-), so T is in the word but not at position 5.\n  - M, I, S are absent (x).\n- **Guess 3 (tough)**:\n  - T is present but in the wrong position (-), so T is not at position 1 (and not at position 5, from Guess 2).\n  - O is correct and in position 2 (✓), reaffirming the pattern.\n  - U, G, H are absent (x).\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ O _ _ _` (O is the second letter).\n- **T Position**: T must be in position 3 or 4 (since it cannot be in 1, 2, or 5).\n- **Absent Letters**: A, C, E, G, H, I, M, N, R, S, U (cannot be in the word).\n- **Available Letters**: B, D, F, K, L, O, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (O and T are confirmed in the word).\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Test T in position 4 (since position 3 is also possible, but we need to resolve T\'s location).\n- Use new high-frequency letters (e.g., L, F, Y) to maximize information.\n- Avoid absent letters and ensure the word fits the pattern `_ O _ T _` (for T in position 4).\n\n**Chosen Guess: LOFTY**  \n- **Why?**  \n  - Tests T in position 4: If T is correct (✓), we lock in position 4. If T is present but wrong position (-), it must be in position 3.  \n  - Tests new letters: L (position 1), F (position 3), Y (position 5).  \n  - Avoids all absent letters and uses common consonants/vowels.  \n  - Valid English word (meaning ""high or elevated"").\n\n<guess>lofty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)\nGuess 3: tough -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(✓) U(x) G(x) H(x)\nGuess 4: lofty -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(✓) F(x) T(✓) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback from previous guesses:\n\n1. **crane**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x).

However, we don\'t have information about duplicates yet.\n\nBut note: the word is _ O _ T Y, so positions 1 and 3 are open.\n\nAvailable letters (not absent and not yet placed): B, D, K, P, V, W, X, Z. (Also, note that O, T, Y are already placed, so we don\'t need to use them again unless duplicated, but we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven\'t seen any duplicates so far, so we might avoid them for now to maximize information.)\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that fits the pattern and uses the available letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- The word must end with ""OTTY""? No, the pattern is _ O _ T Y, so the last three are fixed as O, ?, T, Y? Actually, the pattern is:\n  Position 1: unknown\n  Position 2: O\n  Position 3: unknown\n  Position 4: T\n  Position 5: Y\n\nSo the word is: [letter1] O [letter3] T Y\n\nWe need to choose letter1 and letter3 from the available letters: B, D, K, P, V, W, X, Z.\n\nNow, what words fit this pattern?\n\nLet\'s try:\n- B O ?

T Y:\n  - K O B T Y -> ""KOBTY"" not a word.\n  - K O D T Y -> ""KODTY"" not a word.\n  - K O P T Y -> ""KOPTY"" not a word. (But ""kempt"" is a word but has E and M, which are excluded, and pattern doesn\'t match.)\n  - K O W T Y -> ""KOWTY"" not a word.\n\n- P O ? T Y:\n  - P O B T Y -> ""POBTY"" not a word.\n  - P O D T Y -> ""PODTY"" not a word.\n  - P O K T Y -> ""POKTY"" not a word.\n  - P O W T Y -> ""POWTY"" not a word. But ""pouty"" is a word but has U (excluded) and pattern: P O U T Y, which would be position 3 as U, but U is excluded.\n\n- V O ? T Y:\n  - V O B T Y -> ""VOBTY"" not a word.\n  - V O D T Y -> ""VODTY"" not a word.\n  - V O K T Y -> ""VOKTY"" not a word.\n  - V O W T Y -> ""VOWTY"" not a word.\n\n- W O ?

T Y: \n  - Z O B T Y -> ""ZOBTY"" not a word.\n  - etc.\n\nThis is problematic. None of these combinations form a word.\n\nPerhaps we missed some available letters? We have B, D, K, P, V, W, X, Z. But maybe we can consider that the third letter might be a vowel? The only vowel we have left is not available because A, E, I, O, U are all excluded? O is in the word but already used at position 2. We don\'t have other vowels? The available vowels are none because A, E, I, U are excluded. So the third letter must be a consonant from the available set.\n\nBut we can\'t form a word. What\'s wrong?\n\nPerhaps we have a duplicate letter? For example, maybe the word has two T\'s? But T is at position 4, and we have position 3 open. Could T be at position 3? But in the feedback for ""lofty"", we have T at position 4 marked as correct (✓). And in the pattern, position 3 is a different letter.\n\nBut in ""lofty"", we have:\n  L(x) O(✓) F(x) T(✓) Y(✓)\n\nSo T is at position 4 and correct. So the secret word has T at position 4. Therefore, position 3 cannot be T? Unless the word has two T\'s? But in ""lofty"", we only provided one T (at position 4), so if there is a T at position 3, we wouldn\'t know because we didn\'t guess it. So it\'s possible that there is a T at position 3? But we have T at position 4, so if there is a T at position 3, then the word has two T\'s.\n\nBut in the feedback for ""moist"", we had T at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That T could be the same T as at position 4? But in ""moist"", T was at position 5, and in the secret word, T is at position 4, so that\'s why it was marked as present but wrong position. If there were two T\'s, we might have gotten an additional indication? But in ""moist"", we only had one T, so we only got one \'-\' for T. Similarly, in ""tough"", we had T at position 1 and got \'-\', which could be for the T at position 4 (or 3 if duplicated). But we don\'t have evidence for or against duplicates.\n\nSo perhaps the secret word has two T\'s? Then position 3 could be T.\n\nBut the pattern from ""lofty"" feedback: T is at position 4 and Y at 5, so the word is _ O _ T Y. If position 3 is T, then the word is _ O T T Y.\n\nIs that possible? Then the word would be ? O T T Y.\n\nNow, what words fit ? O T T Y? \n- B O T T Y -> ""BOTTY"" not a common word, but ""botty"" is informal for buttocks? It might be accepted in some dictionaries.\n- P O T T Y -> ""POTTY"" is a common word (a small pot for children or a slang for crazy).\n\nSimilarly, ""dotty"" is D O T T Y, but D is available? But we have to check if D is allowed. D is not in the absent list, so it\'s available.\n\nSo possible words: ""POTTY"", ""BOTTY"", ""DOTTY"", etc.\n\nBut in ""lofty"", we guessed F at position 3 and it was absent. If the secret word is ""POTTY"", then position 3 is T, which we didn\'t guess in ""lofty"", so we got F as absent, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, in ""moist"", we had T at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. In ""POTTY"", T is at positions 3 and 4, so the T at position 5 in ""moist"" would match one of the T\'s? But the feedback only marks one T? In ""moist"", we provided one T, so it would match one occurrence. Since position 5 is not a T (it\'s Y in ""POTTY""? No, ""POTTY"" is P O T T Y, so position 5 is Y, not T. So the T at position 5 in ""moist"" is not in the word at position 5, but it is in the word at positions 3 or 4. So the \'-\' is correct.\n\nSimilarly, in ""tough"", we had T at position 1 and got \'-\', which is correct because T is at 3 and 4.\n\nSo ""POTTY"" is a candidate.\n\nBut we have to check the absent letters: P is not absent, O is present, T is present, T again, Y is present. And no excluded letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, L, M, N, R, S, U, F are excluded. So P is allowed.\n\nSimilarly, ""DOTTY"" (D O T T Y) is also a candidate, with D.\n\n""BOTTY"" (B O T T Y) is less common.\n\nNow, what about the first letter? In ""POTTY"", it\'s P. In ""DOTTY"", it\'s D. In ""BOTTY"", it\'s B.\n\nWe need to choose one.\n\nBut we have only two guesses left (since we are on the fifth guess, and we started with 6). We can guess one of these.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider if there are words without duplicate T? But we couldn\'t find any. So likely, the word has duplicate T.\n\nTherefore, the word is ? O T T Y, with the first letter being one of B, D, P.\n\nWe can try to guess ""POTTY"" because it\'s the most common.\n\nBut let\'s see if there are other possibilities.\n\nWhat if the word is not with duplicate T? Then what could it be? We couldn\'t find any word without duplicate T that fits the pattern and avoids excluded letters.\n\nSo we must go with the duplicate T.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""POTTY"".\n\nBut in ""POTTY"", we have T at position 3 and 4. In the feedback for ""lofty"", we only got T marked at position 4, but not at position 3 because we didn\'t guess it. So it\'s consistent.\n\nSo I think ""POTTY"" is the most likely.\n\nBut to be thorough, let\'s see if there is a word with a different letter at position 3.\n\nFor example, is there a word like ? O D T Y? But we couldn\'t find any. Similarly for other letters.\n\nSo we go with ""POTTY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ O _ T Y` (positions 2, 4, and 5 are fixed as O, T, Y).\n- **Absent Letters**: A, C, E, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, R, S, U (cannot be in the word).\n- **Available Letters for Positions 1 and 3**: B, D, K, P, V, W, X, Z.\n\n### Analysis:\n- No valid words were found without duplicate letters (e.g., `? O ? T Y` with distinct letters), suggesting the possibility of duplicate `T` at position 3.\n- Words like **POTTY** (P O T T Y), **DOTTY** (D O T T Y), or **BOTTY** (B O T T Y) fit the pattern and use available letters.\n- **POTTY** is the most common English word among these options.\n\n### Next Guess: POTTY\n- Tests if the word is **POTTY** (if correct, we win).\n- If incorrect, feedback will confirm if `P` is in the word and provide info on position 3 (likely `T`).\n\n<guess>potty</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n1. **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ O _ T Y` (O in position 2, T in position 4, Y in position 5).\n2. **Absent Letters**: A, C, E, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, R, S, U (all marked ""x"" in previous feedback).\n3. **Available Letters for Positions 1 and 3**: B, D, K, P, V, W, X, Z (since O, T, Y are already placed).\n\n### Key Insight:\n- No common English words fit `_ O _ T Y` without duplicate letters (e.g., `? O ? T Y` with distinct letters). This suggests the secret word likely has a **duplicate T** at position 3 (e.g., `? O T T Y`).\n- Possible words include **POTTY**, **DOTTY**, or **BOTTY**. Among these, **POTTY** is the most common and likely candidate.\n\n### Next Guess: POTTY\n- **Why?**  \n  - Tests `P` at position 1 and `T` at position 3 (duplicate).  \n  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback will confirm if `P` is present and provide more clues for position 1.\n\n<guess>potty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)\nGuess 3: tough -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(✓) U(x) G(x) H(x)\nGuess 4: lofty -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(✓) F(x) T(✓) Y(✓)\nGuess 5: potty -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) T(-) T(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from Guess 5: potty -> P(x) O(✓) T(-) T(✓) Y(✓)

Breaking down the feedback for ""potty"":
- P: absent (x) — so P is not in the word.
- O: correct and in position (✓) — as expected, second letter is O.
- First T (position 3): present but wrong position (-) — this T is in the word, but not at position 3. But note, we already have T at position 4 fixed as correct from the ""lofty"" guess. So this means there is another occurrence of T? Or perhaps the position is wrong. However, the second T (position 4) is correct (✓), and Y at position 5 is correct (✓).

The feedback shows that for the T at position 3, it is in the word but not at position 3. Since we know T is at position 4, this suggests that there might be only one T, and it is at position 4. The symbol '-' for the first T (position 3) simply means that the letter T is in the word, but not at that position — which is consistent because T is at position 4. Similarly, in ""moist"", T was at position 5 and got '-', meaning it was present but not at position 5.

Therefore, the secret word does not have a duplicate T. The pattern remains: _ O _ T Y, with T being only at position 4.

But we already know this. The new information is that P is absent.

So now, absent letters are: A, C, E, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, R, S, U, P.

Available letters: B, D, K, V, W, X, Z (and O, T, Y are placed).

We still need to find the letters at positions 1 and 3.

The word is: [letter1] O [letter3] T Y

With letter1 and letter3 from {B, D, K, V, W, X, Z}.

But we couldn't find any word earlier. Now with P also absent, what could it be?

We must consider that perhaps the third letter is a vowel? But all vowels (A, E, I, O, U) are either used or excluded. O is placed at position 2, and A, E, I, U are excluded. There are no other vowels.

Therefore, the third letter must be one of the available consonants: B, D, K, V, W, X, Z.

Previously, we considered words with duplicate T, but the feedback for ""potty"" doesn't indicate a duplicate T except for the one at position 4. The '-' for T at position 3 does not imply another T; it just means that T is not at position 3.

But what about the word ""dotty""? D is available. But if we assume no duplicate T, then ""dotty"" would be D O T T Y, which has two T's. Similarly, ""botty"" has two T's.

The alternative is that there is a word with two different letters at positions 1 and 3.

Let me try again:

- ""BOTTY"" — not common and has duplicate T.
- ""DOTTY"" — similar issue.
- ""KOTTY"" — not a common word.

But perhaps we missed some words:

- ""BOOTY"": we considered earlier, but the ""lofty"" feedback showed F as absent. However, in ""BOOTY"", the pattern would be B O O T Y. But we got O(✓) in ""lofty"" only for position 2, so position 3 is a different letter. But in ""booty"", position 3 is O. So the feedback for ""lofty"" had F at position 3 absent, but in reality, position 3 is O? But O is already in the word at position 2. That is possible.

We didn't consider the possibility of duplicate O.

In ""lofty"", we guessed F at position 3 and it was absent. If the secret word is ""BOOTY"", then position 3 is O. But we know O is in the word and at position 2. If there is another O at position 3, then in ""lofty"", we didn't guess O at position 3, so we wouldn't get feedback for it. Therefore, it is possible.

Similarly, in ""potty"", we guessed T at position 3 and got '-', but in ""BOOTY"", there is no T at position 3; it's O. So the '-' for T at position 3 in ""potty"" would be incorrect? No: the '-' means T is not at position 3, which is correct because in ""BOOTY"", T is at position 4 only.

So what is the feedback for ""potty"" if the secret word is ""BOOTY"":
  P: x (good, not present)
  O: ✓ (correct position)
  T (position 3): Since there is no T at all in position 3, but T is present in the word at position 4, this T (position 3) should be reported as '-' meaning present but wrong position? Or as 'x' if there is no duplicate?

Let's think: the secret word ""BOOTY"" has letters: B, O, O, T, Y. It has one T at position 4.
When we guess ""POTTY"", the letters are: P, O, T, T, Y.
Comparing to ""BOOTY"":

  Position 1: P (not in word) -> x
  Position 2: O (correct) -> ✓
  Position 3: T (this T is in the secret word? There is a T, but it is at position 4. Also, there is only one T, so the T at position 3 in the guess is not present elsewhere? How would the feedback work?
  Standard rules for duplicates:
  - The feedback is given per position, but it considers duplicates only if they are in excess. That is, if the secret has one T and the guess has two T's, then one T might be marked as '-' and the other as 'x'? 

But in standard practices (like Wordle), the feedback is:

For each letter in the guess:
  If the letter is in the correct position, ✓.
  Otherwise, if the letter is in the word but not in that position and hasn't been matched yet (considering multiplicity), then '-'.
  Otherwise, 'x'.

So for ""POTTY"" vs ""BOOTY"":

- Position 1: P vs B — P not in word -> x
- Position 2: O vs O — correct -> ✓
- Position 3: T vs O — O is not T, but the secret word has a T. However, the T in the secret word is at position 4. Since we haven't used any T for marking yet, the T in position 3 of the guess should be marked as present but wrong position? But the secret word has only one T, and we are guessing two T's. 

For position 3: T is in the secret word (there is one T at position 4), so it should be marked as '-' (present but not at this position).
- Position 4: T vs T — they are the same and same position? But no: in the secret, it's O at position 3 and T at position 4? No, the secret is ""B O O T Y"", so:

  Position 3: secret is O, guess is T
  Position 4: secret is T, guess is T

At position 4: guess T equals secret's T -> ✓

Also, at position 3: we have T guessed, but secret has O. Since T is in the word (at position 4), and we haven't accounted for that T yet? How is it done? In the standard Wordle, feedback is tracked per instance.

Specifically for the T's:
- The secret has only one T (at position 4).
- The guess has two T's: at position 3 and 4.

For the T at position 4: it matches the secret's T -> marked ✓.
For the T at position 3: it is in the secret? But we've already ""used"" the T in the secret for the exact match at position 4, so there is no extra T to match for this one. Therefore, it should be marked as 'x' (not in the word, considering we've already accounted for the T at position 4).

But the feedback we got was: T at position 3 (first T) got '-', which is wrong according to this rule? If the secret has only one T, and we matched it at position 4, then the T at position 3 shouldn't be marked as present.

Wait, let me clarify:

Standard rule: 
  For each occurrence in the secret, if you have an exact match, that takes priority.
  Then, for other positions, if the letter is in the word but not matched elsewhere, mark it with '-'.

In ""POTTY"" vs ""BOOTY"":
  - Position 4: T matches exactly -> ✓, so we've used the T in the secret.
  - Position 3: T is in the secret? Well, there is a T in the secret, but we've already used it for the exact match at position 4, so no, it should be marked 'x'.

But in the feedback we received for guess 5: ""T(-)"" for position 3 and ""T(✓)"" for position 4. So it's marked the first T as present. This suggests that the secret word does have at least two T's? Because both T's in ""potty"" are accounted for: one as present but wrong position (position 3) and one as correct (position 4).

Therefore, the secret word must have at least two T's. Specifically, we know T is at position 4 for sure (from ""lofty"" feedback). From ""moist"" and ""tough"", T was not in positions 1, 5, but it was in the word. Also, in ""potty"", the T at position 3 is marked as present (not at position 3), so there must be another T somewhere.

Given that pattern is _ O _ T Y 

And if there is a duplicate T, then position 3 must be T? Because if position 3 is not T, then where is the other T? Positions available: 1, 3. But position 1 is a letter, position 3 is unknown.

Therefore, the secret word must be ? O T T Y.

That is, T at both position 3 and 4? But position 4 is fixed as T? Yes, but in that case, position 3 being T would make the word ? O T T Y.

And the first letter is what we need to find.

We know P is absent from the last feedback.

First letter must be one of the available: B, D, K, V, W, X, Z (since P is absent).

Possible words: 
- B O T T Y -> ""BOTTY"" (informal and less common)
- D O T T Y -> ""DOTTY"" (eccentric or having dots; common enough)
- K O T T Y -> ""KOTTY"" (not common)
- V O T T Y -> ""VOTTY"" (not common)
- W O T T Y -> ""WOTTY"" (not common)
- X O T T Y -> ""XOTTY"" (not common)
- Z O T T Y -> ""ZOTTY"" (not common)

So ""DOTTY"" and ""BOTTY"" are possible. ""DOTTY"" is more common.

Therefore, we guess ""DOTTY"".

If it's not, then ""BOTTY"", but we have one more guess.

So let's go with ""DOTTY"".Based on the cumulative feedback:

- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ O _ T Y` (positions 2, 4, and 5 are fixed).
- **Feedback from ""potty""**:
  - `T(-)` for position 3 and `T(✓)` for position 4 indicates the secret word has **at least two T's** (one at position 4, and another elsewhere).
  - Since positions 1 and 3 are the only unknowns, and T cannot be at position 1 (per ""tough"" feedback), **position 3 must be T**.
- Thus, the word is `? O T T Y`.

### Next Guess: DOTTY
- **Why?**
  - Tests `D` at position 1 and `T` at position 3 (duplicate T).
  - `DOTTY` is a valid English word (meaning eccentric or having dots).
  - Avoids absent letters (especially `P`, which was ruled out).
- If incorrect, we can try `BOTTY` (less common) with the last guess.

### Analysis of Feedback
From **Guess 5 (potty)**:
- **P(x)**: P is **absent** from the secret word.
- **O(✓)**: O is in the **correct position (2)**.
- **T(-)**: The first T (position 3) is in the word but **not in position 3**.
- **T(✓)**: The second T (position 4) is **correct and in position**.
- **Y(✓)**: Y is **correct and in position (5)**.

### Key Insights
1. **Pattern Confirmation**: The secret word is `_ O _ T Y` (O in position 2, T in position 4, Y in position 5).
2. **Duplicate T**: The `T(-)` at position 3 and `T(✓)` at position 4 confirm **at least two T's** in the word:
   - T at position 4 is fixed (from ""lofty"" feedback).
   - The `T(-)` for position 3 means there is **another T** elsewhere in the word. Since positions 1, 3, and 5 are open, and T cannot be at position 1 (per ""tough"" feedback) or position 5 (per ""moist"" feedback), it **must be at position 3**.
3. **Revised Pattern**: The secret word is `? O T T Y`.
4. **Absent Letters**: A, C, E, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, R, S, U (all marked ""x"" in prior feedback).
5. **Available Letters for Position 1**: B, D, K, V, W, X, Z.

### Likely Words
- **DOTTY**: Common word (eccentric or covered in dots), fits `D O T T Y`.
- **BOTTY**: Less common (informal for buttocks), fits `B O T T Y`.
- **KOTTY/VOTTY/WOTTY**: Not standard English words.

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **DOTTY** is the best candidate:
  - Uses high-probability letters (D is common).
  - Tests the duplicate T at position 3.
  - If correct, solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback will isolate position 1 (e.g., B, K, etc.).

<guess>dotty</guess>",dotty,"We have feedback from Guess 5: potty -> P(x) O(✓) T(-) T(✓) Y(✓)

Breaking down the feedback for ""potty"":
- P: absent (x) — so P is not in the word.
- O: correct and in position (✓) — as expected, second letter is O.
- First T (position 3): present but wrong position (-) — this T is in the word, but not at position 3. But note, we already have T at position 4 fixed as correct from the ""lofty"" guess. So this means there is another occurrence of T? Or perhaps the position is wrong. However, the second T (position 4) is correct (✓), and Y at position 5 is correct (✓).

The feedback shows that for the T at position 3, it is in the word but not at position 3. Since we know T is at position 4, this suggests that there might be only one T, and it is at position 4. The symbol '-' for the first T (position 3) simply means that the letter T is in the word, but not at that position — which is consistent because T is at position 4. Similarly, in ""moist"", T was at position 5 and got '-', meaning it was present but not at position 5.

Therefore, the secret word does not have a duplicate T. The pattern remains: _ O _ T Y, with T being only at position 4.

But we already know this. The new information is that P is absent.

So now, absent letters are: A, C, E, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, R, S, U, P.

Available letters: B, D, K, V, W, X, Z (and O, T, Y are placed).

We still need to find the letters at positions 1 and 3.

The word is: [letter1] O [letter3] T Y

With letter1 and letter3 from {B, D, K, V, W, X, Z}.

But we couldn't find any word earlier. Now with P also absent, what could it be?

We must consider that perhaps the third letter is a vowel? But all vowels (A, E, I, O, U) are either used or excluded. O is placed at position 2, and A, E, I, U are excluded. There are no other vowels.

Therefore, the third letter must be one of the available consonants: B, D, K, V, W, X, Z.

Previously, we considered words with duplicate T, but the feedback for ""potty"" doesn't indicate a duplicate T except for the one at position 4. The '-' for T at position 3 does not imply another T; it just means that T is not at position 3.

But what about the word ""dotty""? D is available. But if we assume no duplicate T, then ""dotty"" would be D O T T Y, which has two T's. Similarly, ""botty"" has two T's.

The alternative is that there is a word with two different letters at positions 1 and 3.

Let me try again:

- ""BOTTY"" — not common and has duplicate T.
- ""DOTTY"" — similar issue.
- ""KOTTY"" — not a common word.

But perhaps we missed some words:

- ""BOOTY"": we considered earlier, but the ""lofty"" feedback showed F as absent. However, in ""BOOTY"", the pattern would be B O O T Y. But we got O(✓) in ""lofty"" only for position 2, so position 3 is a different letter. But in ""booty"", position 3 is O. So the feedback for ""lofty"" had F at position 3 absent, but in reality, position 3 is O? But O is already in the word at position 2. That is possible.

We didn't consider the possibility of duplicate O.

In ""lofty"", we guessed F at position 3 and it was absent. If the secret word is ""BOOTY"", then position 3 is O. But we know O is in the word and at position 2. If there is another O at position 3, then in ""lofty"", we didn't guess O at position 3, so we wouldn't get feedback for it. Therefore, it is possible.

Similarly, in ""potty"", we guessed T at position 3 and got '-', but in ""BOOTY"", there is no T at position 3; it's O. So the '-' for T at position 3 in ""potty"" would be incorrect? No: the '-' means T is not at position 3, which is correct because in ""BOOTY"", T is at position 4 only.

So what is the feedback for ""potty"" if the secret word is ""BOOTY"":
  P: x (good, not present)
  O: ✓ (correct position)
  T (position 3): Since there is no T at all in position 3, but T is present in the word at position 4, this T (position 3) should be reported as '-' meaning present but wrong position? Or as 'x' if there is no duplicate?

Let's think: the secret word ""BOOTY"" has letters: B, O, O, T, Y. It has one T at position 4.
When we guess ""POTTY"", the letters are: P, O, T, T, Y.
Comparing to ""BOOTY"":

  Position 1: P (not in word) -> x
  Position 2: O (correct) -> ✓
  Position 3: T (this T is in the secret word? There is a T, but it is at position 4. Also, there is only one T, so the T at position 3 in the guess is not present elsewhere? How would the feedback work?
  Standard rules for duplicates:
  - The feedback is given per position, but it considers duplicates only if they are in excess. That is, if the secret has one T and the guess has two T's, then one T might be marked as '-' and the other as 'x'? 

But in standard practices (like Wordle), the feedback is:

For each letter in the guess:
  If the letter is in the correct position, ✓.
  Otherwise, if the letter is in the word but not in that position and hasn't been matched yet (considering multiplicity), then '-'.
  Otherwise, 'x'.

So for ""POTTY"" vs ""BOOTY"":

- Position 1: P vs B — P not in word -> x
- Position 2: O vs O — correct -> ✓
- Position 3: T vs O — O is not T, but the secret word has a T. However, the T in the secret word is at position 4. Since we haven't used any T for marking yet, the T in position 3 of the guess should be marked as present but wrong position? But the secret word has only one T, and we are guessing two T's. 

For position 3: T is in the secret word (there is one T at position 4), so it should be marked as '-' (present but not at this position).
- Position 4: T vs T — they are the same and same position? But no: in the secret, it's O at position 3 and T at position 4? No, the secret is ""B O O T Y"", so:

  Position 3: secret is O, guess is T
  Position 4: secret is T, guess is T

At position 4: guess T equals secret's T -> ✓

Also, at position 3: we have T guessed, but secret has O. Since T is in the word (at position 4), and we haven't accounted for that T yet? How is it done? In the standard Wordle, feedback is tracked per instance.

Specifically for the T's:
- The secret has only one T (at position 4).
- The guess has two T's: at position 3 and 4.

For the T at position 4: it matches the secret's T -> marked ✓.
For the T at position 3: it is in the secret? But we've already ""used"" the T in the secret for the exact match at position 4, so there is no extra T to match for this one. Therefore, it should be marked as 'x' (not in the word, considering we've already accounted for the T at position 4).

But the feedback we got was: T at position 3 (first T) got '-', which is wrong according to this rule? If the secret has only one T, and we matched it at position 4, then the T at position 3 shouldn't be marked as present.

Wait, let me clarify:

Standard rule: 
  For each occurrence in the secret, if you have an exact match, that takes priority.
  Then, for other positions, if the letter is in the word but not matched elsewhere, mark it with '-'.

In ""POTTY"" vs ""BOOTY"":
  - Position 4: T matches exactly -> ✓, so we've used the T in the secret.
  - Position 3: T is in the secret? Well, there is a T in the secret, but we've already used it for the exact match at position 4, so no, it should be marked 'x'.

But in the feedback we received for guess 5: ""T(-)"" for position 3 and ""T(✓)"" for position 4. So it's marked the first T as present. This suggests that the secret word does have at least two T's? Because both T's in ""potty"" are accounted for: one as present but wrong position (position 3) and one as correct (position 4).

Therefore, the secret word must have at least two T's. Specifically, we know T is at position 4 for sure (from ""lofty"" feedback). From ""moist"" and ""tough"", T was not in positions 1, 5, but it was in the word. Also, in ""potty"", the T at position 3 is marked as present (not at position 3), so there must be another T somewhere.

Given that pattern is _ O _ T Y 

And if there is a duplicate T, then position 3 must be T? Because if position 3 is not T, then where is the other T? Positions available: 1, 3. But position 1 is a letter, position 3 is unknown.

Therefore, the secret word must be ? O T T Y.

That is, T at both position 3 and 4? But position 4 is fixed as T? Yes, but in that case, position 3 being T would make the word ? O T T Y.

And the first letter is what we need to find.

We know P is absent from the last feedback.

First letter must be one of the available: B, D, K, V, W, X, Z (since P is absent).

Possible words: 
- B O T T Y -> ""BOTTY"" (informal and less common)
- D O T T Y -> ""DOTTY"" (eccentric or having dots; common enough)
- K O T T Y -> ""KOTTY"" (not common)
- V O T T Y -> ""VOTTY"" (not common)
- W O T T Y -> ""WOTTY"" (not common)
- X O T T Y -> ""XOTTY"" (not common)
- Z O T T Y -> ""ZOTTY"" (not common)

So ""DOTTY"" and ""BOTTY"" are possible. ""DOTTY"" is more common.

Therefore, we guess ""DOTTY"".

If it's not, then ""BOTTY"", but we have one more guess.

So let's go with ""DOTTY"".Based on the cumulative feedback:

- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ O _ T Y` (positions 2, 4, and 5 are fixed).
- **Feedback from ""potty""**:
  - `T(-)` for position 3 and `T(✓)` for position 4 indicates the secret word has **at least two T's** (one at position 4, and another elsewhere).
  - Since positions 1 and 3 are the only unknowns, and T cannot be at position 1 (per ""tough"" feedback), **position 3 must be T**.
- Thus, the word is `? O T T Y`.

### Next Guess: DOTTY
- **Why?**
  - Tests `D` at position 1 and `T` at position 3 (duplicate T).
  - `DOTTY` is a valid English word (meaning eccentric or having dots).
  - Avoids absent letters (especially `P`, which was ruled out).
- If incorrect, we can try `BOTTY` (less common) with the last guess.
