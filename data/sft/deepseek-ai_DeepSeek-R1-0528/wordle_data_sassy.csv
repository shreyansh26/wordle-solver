We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 However, note that the example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we can choose any valid 5-letter word.

 Let me choose a word that has a set of common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 But note: the example secret word was ""BRISK"", so let's not base our choice on that.

 Alternatively, I can choose ""ROAST"" or ""SLATE"". However, I recall that ""RAISE"" is also a good starting word because it has three vowels and common consonants.

 Since we are at the first guess, any of these are acceptable.

 I'll choose: ""RAISE""

 Why?
 - It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
 - It covers a good set of letters.

 So, my first guess is ""RAISE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so the second letter of the secret word is A)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so the fourth letter of the secret word is S)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter is A (position 2).
- The fourth letter is S (position 4).
- The letters R, I, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ A _ S _

We also know that the word does not contain R, I, E.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should try to use a word that:
- Has the second letter as A and the fourth letter as S (to confirm or get more information, but note we already know these are fixed, so we can use them to test other positions).
- Includes other common letters that haven't been tried yet (avoiding R, I, E).

Common letters we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to form a word that fits the pattern _ A _ S _ and uses new letters.

But note: our guess doesn't have to have A in the second and S in the fourth? Actually, we can, but we might also choose to test other positions. However, since we know A and S are in those positions, we can use them to help us find the other letters.

Let me think of words that have the form _ A _ S _ and do not contain R, I, E.

Some possibilities:
- TANS: but that's 4 letters, we need 5. So, TANSY? Not common. 
- We need 5-letter words.

Common words:
- TASKS: T A S K S -> but the fourth letter is K, not S? Wait, let's break down: 
  Position: 1: T, 2: A, 3: S, 4: K, 5: S -> that doesn't fit because we need S at the fourth position, but here the fourth is K and fifth is S. Also, we have S at the third and fifth, but we know the fourth is S, so that might be acceptable? Actually, the pattern is _ A _ S _, so:
  Position 1: any
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: any
  Position 4: S
  Position 5: any

So, TASKS: 
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: A -> good
- Position 3: S -> but we don't know about position 3, so that's okay
- Position 4: K -> but we need S at position 4? Wait, no: in TASKS, the fourth letter is K (if we count: 1:T, 2:A, 3:S, 4:K, 5:S). So the fourth letter is K, not S. So that doesn't match.

We need a word where the fourth letter is S. So the pattern is: 
Letter1: ?, Letter2: A, Letter3: ?, Letter4: S, Letter5: ?

Examples:
- CLASS: C L A S S -> but that's A at position 3, not 2. So no.
- PASTA: P A S T A -> but then position 3 is S, but we need position 4 to be S? 
  Let's break: 
  P (1), A (2), S (3), T (4), A (5) -> so position 4 is T, not S.

We need the fourth letter to be S. So:

- GAWKS: G A W K S -> position 4 is K, not S.
- BASTS: B A S T S -> position 4 is T? 
  B(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), S(5) -> position 4 is T.

I think I'm having trouble. Let me think of words ending with S? But we need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the fourth letter as S, meaning the last two letters are the fifth and the fourth is S? Not necessarily, because the fifth can be anything.

Actually, the word must have the structure: 
[letter1] A [letter3] S [letter5]

So, for example:
- MASTS: M A S T S -> 
  M(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), S(5) -> but position 4 is T, not S. We need position 4 to be S? 
  Wait, no: in MASTS, the letters are: 
  Position 1: M
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: S
  Position 4: T
  Position 5: S

That doesn't have S at position 4.

We need the fourth letter to be S. So the word must have the fourth character as S. 

For example:
- The word ""PASS"" is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

Let me think of 5-letter words with S at the fourth position and A at the second.

Examples:
- CAUSE: C A U S E -> 
  C(1), A(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E is already eliminated (from first feedback: E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.

- FEAST: F E A S T -> 
  F(1), E(2), A(3), S(4), T(5) -> but position 2 is E, not A. We need A at position 2.

We need A at position 2 and S at position 4.

So:
- Letter1: ?
- Letter2: A
- Letter3: ?
- Letter4: S
- Letter5: ?

And the word must not contain R, I, E.

Possible words:
- HASTY: H A S T Y -> 
  H(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but position 4 is T, not S. We need position 4 to be S, so the third letter is free, but the fourth must be S.

In HASTY, the fourth letter is T, not S.

I think I'm making a mistake. Let me clarify: the fourth letter must be S, so in the word, the character at index 3 (if we start counting at 0) or index 4? 

In the feedback, we count positions starting from 1.

For the word ""RAISE"":
- R is position 1
- A is position 2
- I is position 3
- S is position 4
- E is position 5

So, the feedback said A is correct at position 2 and S is correct at position 4.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 1: unknown, but not R (since R is not in the word)
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: unknown, but not I (since I is not in the word)
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: unknown, but not E

So the pattern is: [not R, not I, not E] A [not R, not I, not E] S [not R, not I, not E]

Now, we need to find a word that fits: _ A _ S _

And we must avoid the letters R, I, E.

Let me list some words that fit this pattern:

- TALKS: T A L K S -> 
  Position 1: T, 2: A, 3: L, 4: K, 5: S -> but position 4 is K, not S. We need position 4 to be S.

- We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the fourth character as S.

Examples of words with second letter A and fourth letter S:

- GAZES: but has E and Z? And E is eliminated.
- JAZZY: J A Z Z Y -> position 4 is Z, not S.
- I'm struggling. Let me think of common words.

Another idea: ""BASIS"" -> B A S I S -> 
  B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5) -> but position 4 is I, not S. And I is eliminated.

""CASKS"": C A S K S -> 
  C(1), A(2), S(3), K(4), S(5) -> position 4 is K.

""PASSE"": P A S S E -> 
  P(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E is eliminated.

""MASSE"": same issue with E.

""WASPS"": W A S P S -> 
  W(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), S(5) -> position 4 is P.

I need to look for words where the fourth letter is S. That means the word has the structure: ??A?S? but with the fourth letter being the fourth character.

Actually, the fourth character is the one at index 3 (if we index from 0). So in a 5-letter word, the positions are:
Index 0: first letter
Index 1: second letter
Index 2: third letter
Index 3: fourth letter
Index 4: fifth letter

We need:
Index 1: A
Index 3: S

So, the word: [0] A [2] S [4]

And [0], [2], [4] cannot be R, I, E, and also not the letters we know are absent.

Now, let me think of words:

- ""HASTE"": H A S T E -> 
  [0]:H, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> but [3] is T, not S. And we need [3] to be S.

I think I found one: ""CAUSE"" has [3] as S? 
C A U S E: 
[0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:U, [3]:S, [4]:E -> yes, but [4] is E which is eliminated.

- ""PAUSE"": same issue.

- ""TASTE"": T A S T E -> 
  [0]:T, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> [3] is T, not S.

- ""BASTE"": same as TASTE.

- ""PASTE"": P A S T E -> 
  [0]:P, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> [3] is T.

I need to find a word where the fourth letter (index 3) is S.

For example:
- ""GASPS"": G A S P S -> 
  [0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:P, [4]:S -> [3] is P.

- ""CLASS"": C L A S S -> 
  [0]:C, [1]:L, [2]:A, [3]:S, [4]:S -> but [1] is L, not A. We need [1] to be A.

We need [1] to be A and [3] to be S.

So, the word must have:
- The second letter (index 1) is A.
- The fourth letter (index 3) is S.

So, the structure: 
Letter0: ?
Letter1: A
Letter2: ?
Letter3: S
Letter4: ?

And the word must not contain R, I, E.

Let me search my vocabulary:

- ""DAISY"": D A I S Y -> 
  [0]:D, [1]:A, [2]:I, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> but I is eliminated (from first feedback: I is not in the word). So we cannot use I.

- ""HASTY"": H A S T Y -> 
  [0]:H, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:Y -> [3] is T, not S.

- ""NASTY"": N A S T Y -> same, [3] is T.

- ""PASTY"": P A S T Y -> same.

- ""TANSY"": T A N S Y -> 
  [0]:T, [1]:A, [2]:N, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> yes! [3] is S.

So, ""TANSY"" is a word? It means a type of plant. But is it common? In Wordle, the word list might include it.

But let's check the letters: T, A, N, S, Y. 
- T: not eliminated
- A: we know is in
- N: new
- S: we know is in
- Y: new

And it doesn't contain R, I, E.

So, ""TANSY"" fits the pattern and uses new letters.

Another word: ""MANGO"" doesn't have S at position 4.

""BASSO"" is not common.

""CASAS"": C A S A S -> 
  [0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:A, [4]:S -> [3] is A, not S.

""LASSI"": L A S S I -> 
  [0]:L, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:I -> [3] is S, but [4] is I which is eliminated.

""PASHA"": P A S H A -> 
  [0]:P, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:H, [4]:A -> [3] is H.

I think ""TANSY"" is a candidate.

Another one: ""JASPS"" is not common.

Or ""VASAL"", but [3] is A.

Perhaps ""TAWSE"", but has E.

I think ""TANSY"" is acceptable.

But note: we are allowed to guess any valid 5-letter word, not necessarily one that fits the known positions. However, it's efficient to use the known positions to test other letters.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that doesn't have A in position 2 and S in position 4, but that would waste the known information. It's better to use them to get more information about the other positions.

So, I'll go with ""TANSY"".

But let me confirm: TANSY is a valid word? Yes, it's in the dictionary.

So, guess: TANSY

We hope to get feedback that tells us about T, N, Y and also confirms A and S (which we already know).

But note: we know A and S are in the word, but in TANSY, A is at position 2 and S is at position 4, which are the correct positions? We know they are correct, so we expect them to be marked as correct.

However, the feedback might show:
- T: ? 
- A: should be ✓
- N: ?
- S: should be ✓
- Y: ?

But the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but in this case, TANSY has unique letters.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that has different letters to test more.

But with the constraints, TANSY is a good choice.

Another common word: ""PASTA"" doesn't fit because [3] is T.

Or ""MASTA"" not a word.

I think TANSY is fine.

But let me think of a more common word: ""HASTY"" doesn't have S at [3].

What about ""BASES"": B A S E S -> 
  [0]:B, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:E, [4]:S -> [3] is E, eliminated.

""CASES"": same.

""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> 
  [0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> [3] is S! Yes.

So, ""GASSY"" is a word. It means containing gas or gaseous.

Letters: G, A, S, S, Y. 
- G: new
- A: known
- S: known (but we have two S's)
- Y: new

But note: the feedback for the first guess said S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4). It didn't say anything about multiple S's. So there could be multiple S's.

In ""GASSY"", we have S at position 2 and 3? 
[0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:Y

So position 4 is [3] which is S, so that matches. And position 2 is A, which matches.

But we have an extra S at position 2? [2] is S.

The secret word might have an S at position 3? We don't know.

But in our first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was correct. We didn't have S at position 3 in the first guess (we had I at position 3). So we don't know about position 3.

So ""GASSY"" is also a candidate.

But ""GASSY"" has two S's. It might be a good test because if the secret word has only one S, then one of the S's in GASSY might be marked as wrong position or not present? But we know position 4 must be S, so the S at position 3 in GASSY might be additional.

But to avoid complexity, maybe a word with unique letters is better. TANSY has unique letters.

However, TANSY is less common. Let me see if there's a more common word.

Another word: ""PAYSA"" not a word.

""TASSA"" not common.

""CANST"": C A N S T -> 
  [0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:N, [3]:S, [4]:T -> yes! [3] is S.

""CANST"" is an archaic word for can or container, but might be in the word list.

""HASTY"" doesn't work.

""NASTY"" doesn't work.

""PASTY"" doesn't work.

""RASTA"" has R, which is eliminated.

I think ""TANSY"" or ""GASSY"" or ""CANST"" are options.

But ""GASSY"" is in the Wordle word list, I believe.

To maximize new letters, TANSY has T, N, Y which are new.

GASSY has G and Y, but S is repeated.

Since we have limited guesses, I'd prefer to test more new letters.

So, I'll go with ""TANSY"".

But let me check: in the first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was correct. In TANSY, we are putting S at position 4 again, which is safe because we know it's correct. And A at position 2 is also correct.

The new letters are T at 1, N at 3, Y at 5.

So, after this guess, we will know about T, N, Y.

Therefore, I choose ""TANSY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, I, and E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the correct position (position 2).
- S is in the correct position (position 4).

The secret word must have the form: _ A _ S _, and it cannot contain R, I, or E. For the second guess, I chose ""TANSY"" because:
- It fits the known pattern (A at position 2, S at position 4).
- It introduces new common letters (T, N, Y) that haven't been tested yet.
- It avoids the eliminated letters (R, I, E).

This guess will help test the presence of T, N, and Y, and confirm the positions of A and S.

<guess>TANSY</guess>",TANSY,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so the second letter of the secret word is A)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so the fourth letter of the secret word is S)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter is A (position 2).
- The fourth letter is S (position 4).
- The letters R, I, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ A _ S _

We also know that the word does not contain R, I, E.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should try to use a word that:
- Has the second letter as A and the fourth letter as S (to confirm or get more information, but note we already know these are fixed, so we can use them to test other positions).
- Includes other common letters that haven't been tried yet (avoiding R, I, E).

Common letters we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to form a word that fits the pattern _ A _ S _ and uses new letters.

But note: our guess doesn't have to have A in the second and S in the fourth? Actually, we can, but we might also choose to test other positions. However, since we know A and S are in those positions, we can use them to help us find the other letters.

Let me think of words that have the form _ A _ S _ and do not contain R, I, E.

Some possibilities:
- TANS: but that's 4 letters, we need 5. So, TANSY? Not common. 
- We need 5-letter words.

Common words:
- TASKS: T A S K S -> but the fourth letter is K, not S? Wait, let's break down: 
  Position: 1: T, 2: A, 3: S, 4: K, 5: S -> that doesn't fit because we need S at the fourth position, but here the fourth is K and fifth is S. Also, we have S at the third and fifth, but we know the fourth is S, so that might be acceptable? Actually, the pattern is _ A _ S _, so:
  Position 1: any
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: any
  Position 4: S
  Position 5: any

So, TASKS: 
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: A -> good
- Position 3: S -> but we don't know about position 3, so that's okay
- Position 4: K -> but we need S at position 4? Wait, no: in TASKS, the fourth letter is K (if we count: 1:T, 2:A, 3:S, 4:K, 5:S). So the fourth letter is K, not S. So that doesn't match.

We need a word where the fourth letter is S. So the pattern is: 
Letter1: ?, Letter2: A, Letter3: ?, Letter4: S, Letter5: ?

Examples:
- CLASS: C L A S S -> but that's A at position 3, not 2. So no.
- PASTA: P A S T A -> but then position 3 is S, but we need position 4 to be S? 
  Let's break: 
  P (1), A (2), S (3), T (4), A (5) -> so position 4 is T, not S.

We need the fourth letter to be S. So:

- GAWKS: G A W K S -> position 4 is K, not S.
- BASTS: B A S T S -> position 4 is T? 
  B(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), S(5) -> position 4 is T.

I think I'm having trouble. Let me think of words ending with S? But we need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the fourth letter as S, meaning the last two letters are the fifth and the fourth is S? Not necessarily, because the fifth can be anything.

Actually, the word must have the structure: 
[letter1] A [letter3] S [letter5]

So, for example:
- MASTS: M A S T S -> 
  M(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), S(5) -> but position 4 is T, not S. We need position 4 to be S? 
  Wait, no: in MASTS, the letters are: 
  Position 1: M
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: S
  Position 4: T
  Position 5: S

That doesn't have S at position 4.

We need the fourth letter to be S. So the word must have the fourth character as S. 

For example:
- The word ""PASS"" is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

Let me think of 5-letter words with S at the fourth position and A at the second.

Examples:
- CAUSE: C A U S E -> 
  C(1), A(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E is already eliminated (from first feedback: E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.

- FEAST: F E A S T -> 
  F(1), E(2), A(3), S(4), T(5) -> but position 2 is E, not A. We need A at position 2.

We need A at position 2 and S at position 4.

So:
- Letter1: ?
- Letter2: A
- Letter3: ?
- Letter4: S
- Letter5: ?

And the word must not contain R, I, E.

Possible words:
- HASTY: H A S T Y -> 
  H(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but position 4 is T, not S. We need position 4 to be S, so the third letter is free, but the fourth must be S.

In HASTY, the fourth letter is T, not S.

I think I'm making a mistake. Let me clarify: the fourth letter must be S, so in the word, the character at index 3 (if we start counting at 0) or index 4? 

In the feedback, we count positions starting from 1.

For the word ""RAISE"":
- R is position 1
- A is position 2
- I is position 3
- S is position 4
- E is position 5

So, the feedback said A is correct at position 2 and S is correct at position 4.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 1: unknown, but not R (since R is not in the word)
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: unknown, but not I (since I is not in the word)
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: unknown, but not E

So the pattern is: [not R, not I, not E] A [not R, not I, not E] S [not R, not I, not E]

Now, we need to find a word that fits: _ A _ S _

And we must avoid the letters R, I, E.

Let me list some words that fit this pattern:

- TALKS: T A L K S -> 
  Position 1: T, 2: A, 3: L, 4: K, 5: S -> but position 4 is K, not S. We need position 4 to be S.

- We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the fourth character as S.

Examples of words with second letter A and fourth letter S:

- GAZES: but has E and Z? And E is eliminated.
- JAZZY: J A Z Z Y -> position 4 is Z, not S.
- I'm struggling. Let me think of common words.

Another idea: ""BASIS"" -> B A S I S -> 
  B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5) -> but position 4 is I, not S. And I is eliminated.

""CASKS"": C A S K S -> 
  C(1), A(2), S(3), K(4), S(5) -> position 4 is K.

""PASSE"": P A S S E -> 
  P(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E is eliminated.

""MASSE"": same issue with E.

""WASPS"": W A S P S -> 
  W(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), S(5) -> position 4 is P.

I need to look for words where the fourth letter is S. That means the word has the structure: ??A?S? but with the fourth letter being the fourth character.

Actually, the fourth character is the one at index 3 (if we index from 0). So in a 5-letter word, the positions are:
Index 0: first letter
Index 1: second letter
Index 2: third letter
Index 3: fourth letter
Index 4: fifth letter

We need:
Index 1: A
Index 3: S

So, the word: [0] A [2] S [4]

And [0], [2], [4] cannot be R, I, E, and also not the letters we know are absent.

Now, let me think of words:

- ""HASTE"": H A S T E -> 
  [0]:H, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> but [3] is T, not S. And we need [3] to be S.

I think I found one: ""CAUSE"" has [3] as S? 
C A U S E: 
[0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:U, [3]:S, [4]:E -> yes, but [4] is E which is eliminated.

- ""PAUSE"": same issue.

- ""TASTE"": T A S T E -> 
  [0]:T, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> [3] is T, not S.

- ""BASTE"": same as TASTE.

- ""PASTE"": P A S T E -> 
  [0]:P, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> [3] is T.

I need to find a word where the fourth letter (index 3) is S.

For example:
- ""GASPS"": G A S P S -> 
  [0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:P, [4]:S -> [3] is P.

- ""CLASS"": C L A S S -> 
  [0]:C, [1]:L, [2]:A, [3]:S, [4]:S -> but [1] is L, not A. We need [1] to be A.

We need [1] to be A and [3] to be S.

So, the word must have:
- The second letter (index 1) is A.
- The fourth letter (index 3) is S.

So, the structure: 
Letter0: ?
Letter1: A
Letter2: ?
Letter3: S
Letter4: ?

And the word must not contain R, I, E.

Let me search my vocabulary:

- ""DAISY"": D A I S Y -> 
  [0]:D, [1]:A, [2]:I, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> but I is eliminated (from first feedback: I is not in the word). So we cannot use I.

- ""HASTY"": H A S T Y -> 
  [0]:H, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:Y -> [3] is T, not S.

- ""NASTY"": N A S T Y -> same, [3] is T.

- ""PASTY"": P A S T Y -> same.

- ""TANSY"": T A N S Y -> 
  [0]:T, [1]:A, [2]:N, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> yes! [3] is S.

So, ""TANSY"" is a word? It means a type of plant. But is it common? In Wordle, the word list might include it.

But let's check the letters: T, A, N, S, Y. 
- T: not eliminated
- A: we know is in
- N: new
- S: we know is in
- Y: new

And it doesn't contain R, I, E.

So, ""TANSY"" fits the pattern and uses new letters.

Another word: ""MANGO"" doesn't have S at position 4.

""BASSO"" is not common.

""CASAS"": C A S A S -> 
  [0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:A, [4]:S -> [3] is A, not S.

""LASSI"": L A S S I -> 
  [0]:L, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:I -> [3] is S, but [4] is I which is eliminated.

""PASHA"": P A S H A -> 
  [0]:P, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:H, [4]:A -> [3] is H.

I think ""TANSY"" is a candidate.

Another one: ""JASPS"" is not common.

Or ""VASAL"", but [3] is A.

Perhaps ""TAWSE"", but has E.

I think ""TANSY"" is acceptable.

But note: we are allowed to guess any valid 5-letter word, not necessarily one that fits the known positions. However, it's efficient to use the known positions to test other letters.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that doesn't have A in position 2 and S in position 4, but that would waste the known information. It's better to use them to get more information about the other positions.

So, I'll go with ""TANSY"".

But let me confirm: TANSY is a valid word? Yes, it's in the dictionary.

So, guess: TANSY

We hope to get feedback that tells us about T, N, Y and also confirms A and S (which we already know).

But note: we know A and S are in the word, but in TANSY, A is at position 2 and S is at position 4, which are the correct positions? We know they are correct, so we expect them to be marked as correct.

However, the feedback might show:
- T: ? 
- A: should be ✓
- N: ?
- S: should be ✓
- Y: ?

But the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but in this case, TANSY has unique letters.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that has different letters to test more.

But with the constraints, TANSY is a good choice.

Another common word: ""PASTA"" doesn't fit because [3] is T.

Or ""MASTA"" not a word.

I think TANSY is fine.

But let me think of a more common word: ""HASTY"" doesn't have S at [3].

What about ""BASES"": B A S E S -> 
  [0]:B, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:E, [4]:S -> [3] is E, eliminated.

""CASES"": same.

""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> 
  [0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> [3] is S! Yes.

So, ""GASSY"" is a word. It means containing gas or gaseous.

Letters: G, A, S, S, Y. 
- G: new
- A: known
- S: known (but we have two S's)
- Y: new

But note: the feedback for the first guess said S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4). It didn't say anything about multiple S's. So there could be multiple S's.

In ""GASSY"", we have S at position 2 and 3? 
[0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:Y

So position 4 is [3] which is S, so that matches. And position 2 is A, which matches.

But we have an extra S at position 2? [2] is S.

The secret word might have an S at position 3? We don't know.

But in our first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was correct. We didn't have S at position 3 in the first guess (we had I at position 3). So we don't know about position 3.

So ""GASSY"" is also a candidate.

But ""GASSY"" has two S's. It might be a good test because if the secret word has only one S, then one of the S's in GASSY might be marked as wrong position or not present? But we know position 4 must be S, so the S at position 3 in GASSY might be additional.

But to avoid complexity, maybe a word with unique letters is better. TANSY has unique letters.

However, TANSY is less common. Let me see if there's a more common word.

Another word: ""PAYSA"" not a word.

""TASSA"" not common.

""CANST"": C A N S T -> 
  [0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:N, [3]:S, [4]:T -> yes! [3] is S.

""CANST"" is an archaic word for can or container, but might be in the word list.

""HASTY"" doesn't work.

""NASTY"" doesn't work.

""PASTY"" doesn't work.

""RASTA"" has R, which is eliminated.

I think ""TANSY"" or ""GASSY"" or ""CANST"" are options.

But ""GASSY"" is in the Wordle word list, I believe.

To maximize new letters, TANSY has T, N, Y which are new.

GASSY has G and Y, but S is repeated.

Since we have limited guesses, I'd prefer to test more new letters.

So, I'll go with ""TANSY"".

But let me check: in the first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was correct. In TANSY, we are putting S at position 4 again, which is safe because we know it's correct. And A at position 2 is also correct.

The new letters are T at 1, N at 3, Y at 5.

So, after this guess, we will know about T, N, Y.

Therefore, I choose ""TANSY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, I, and E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the correct position (position 2).
- S is in the correct position (position 4).

The secret word must have the form: _ A _ S _, and it cannot contain R, I, or E. For the second guess, I chose ""TANSY"" because:
- It fits the known pattern (A at position 2, S at position 4).
- It introduces new common letters (T, N, Y) that haven't been tested yet.
- It avoids the eliminated letters (R, I, E).

This guess will help test the presence of T, N, and Y, and confirm the positions of A and S.",Guess 2: TANSY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) N(x) S(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 However, note that the example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we can choose any valid 5-letter word.

 Let me choose a word that has a set of common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 But note: the example secret word was ""BRISK"", so let's not base our choice on that.

 Alternatively, I can choose ""ROAST"" or ""SLATE"". However, I recall that ""RAISE"" is also a good starting word because it has three vowels and common consonants.

 Since we are at the first guess, any of these are acceptable.

 I'll choose: ""RAISE""

 Why?
 - It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
 - It covers a good set of letters.

 So, my first guess is ""RAISE"".I am starting the game and need to make my first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a word with common letters to maximize information. A good starting word typically includes frequent vowels and consonants. I'll use ""RAISE"" because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), covering a broad range of possibilities. This should help narrow down the secret word effectively.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so the second letter of the secret word is A)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so the fourth letter of the secret word is S)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter is A (position 2).
- The fourth letter is S (position 4).
- The letters R, I, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ A _ S _

We also know that the word does not contain R, I, E.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should try to use a word that:
- Has the second letter as A and the fourth letter as S (to confirm or get more information, but note we already know these are fixed, so we can use them to test other positions).
- Includes other common letters that haven't been tried yet (avoiding R, I, E).

Common letters we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to form a word that fits the pattern _ A _ S _ and uses new letters.

But note: our guess doesn't have to have A in the second and S in the fourth? Actually, we can, but we might also choose to test other positions. However, since we know A and S are in those positions, we can use them to help us find the other letters.

Let me think of words that have the form _ A _ S _ and do not contain R, I, E.

Some possibilities:
- TANS: but that's 4 letters, we need 5. So, TANSY? Not common. 
- We need 5-letter words.

Common words:
- TASKS: T A S K S -> but the fourth letter is K, not S? Wait, let's break down: 
  Position: 1: T, 2: A, 3: S, 4: K, 5: S -> that doesn't fit because we need S at the fourth position, but here the fourth is K and fifth is S. Also, we have S at the third and fifth, but we know the fourth is S, so that might be acceptable? Actually, the pattern is _ A _ S _, so:
  Position 1: any
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: any
  Position 4: S
  Position 5: any

So, TASKS: 
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: A -> good
- Position 3: S -> but we don't know about position 3, so that's okay
- Position 4: K -> but we need S at position 4? Wait, no: in TASKS, the fourth letter is K (if we count: 1:T, 2:A, 3:S, 4:K, 5:S). So the fourth letter is K, not S. So that doesn't match.

We need a word where the fourth letter is S. So the pattern is: 
Letter1: ?, Letter2: A, Letter3: ?, Letter4: S, Letter5: ?

Examples:
- CLASS: C L A S S -> but that's A at position 3, not 2. So no.
- PASTA: P A S T A -> but then position 3 is S, but we need position 4 to be S? 
  Let's break: 
  P (1), A (2), S (3), T (4), A (5) -> so position 4 is T, not S.

We need the fourth letter to be S. So:

- GAWKS: G A W K S -> position 4 is K, not S.
- BASTS: B A S T S -> position 4 is T? 
  B(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), S(5) -> position 4 is T.

I think I'm having trouble. Let me think of words ending with S? But we need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the fourth letter as S, meaning the last two letters are the fifth and the fourth is S? Not necessarily, because the fifth can be anything.

Actually, the word must have the structure: 
[letter1] A [letter3] S [letter5]

So, for example:
- MASTS: M A S T S -> 
  M(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), S(5) -> but position 4 is T, not S. We need position 4 to be S? 
  Wait, no: in MASTS, the letters are: 
  Position 1: M
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: S
  Position 4: T
  Position 5: S

That doesn't have S at position 4.

We need the fourth letter to be S. So the word must have the fourth character as S. 

For example:
- The word ""PASS"" is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

Let me think of 5-letter words with S at the fourth position and A at the second.

Examples:
- CAUSE: C A U S E -> 
  C(1), A(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E is already eliminated (from first feedback: E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.

- FEAST: F E A S T -> 
  F(1), E(2), A(3), S(4), T(5) -> but position 2 is E, not A. We need A at position 2.

We need A at position 2 and S at position 4.

So:
- Letter1: ?
- Letter2: A
- Letter3: ?
- Letter4: S
- Letter5: ?

And the word must not contain R, I, E.

Possible words:
- HASTY: H A S T Y -> 
  H(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but position 4 is T, not S. We need position 4 to be S, so the third letter is free, but the fourth must be S.

In HASTY, the fourth letter is T, not S.

I think I'm making a mistake. Let me clarify: the fourth letter must be S, so in the word, the character at index 3 (if we start counting at 0) or index 4? 

In the feedback, we count positions starting from 1.

For the word ""RAISE"":
- R is position 1
- A is position 2
- I is position 3
- S is position 4
- E is position 5

So, the feedback said A is correct at position 2 and S is correct at position 4.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 1: unknown, but not R (since R is not in the word)
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: unknown, but not I (since I is not in the word)
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: unknown, but not E

So the pattern is: [not R, not I, not E] A [not R, not I, not E] S [not R, not I, not E]

Now, we need to find a word that fits: _ A _ S _

And we must avoid the letters R, I, E.

Let me list some words that fit this pattern:

- TALKS: T A L K S -> 
  Position 1: T, 2: A, 3: L, 4: K, 5: S -> but position 4 is K, not S. We need position 4 to be S.

- We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the fourth character as S.

Examples of words with second letter A and fourth letter S:

- GAZES: but has E and Z? And E is eliminated.
- JAZZY: J A Z Z Y -> position 4 is Z, not S.
- I'm struggling. Let me think of common words.

Another idea: ""BASIS"" -> B A S I S -> 
  B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5) -> but position 4 is I, not S. And I is eliminated.

""CASKS"": C A S K S -> 
  C(1), A(2), S(3), K(4), S(5) -> position 4 is K.

""PASSE"": P A S S E -> 
  P(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E is eliminated.

""MASSE"": same issue with E.

""WASPS"": W A S P S -> 
  W(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), S(5) -> position 4 is P.

I need to look for words where the fourth letter is S. That means the word has the structure: ??A?S? but with the fourth letter being the fourth character.

Actually, the fourth character is the one at index 3 (if we index from 0). So in a 5-letter word, the positions are:
Index 0: first letter
Index 1: second letter
Index 2: third letter
Index 3: fourth letter
Index 4: fifth letter

We need:
Index 1: A
Index 3: S

So, the word: [0] A [2] S [4]

And [0], [2], [4] cannot be R, I, E, and also not the letters we know are absent.

Now, let me think of words:

- ""HASTE"": H A S T E -> 
  [0]:H, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> but [3] is T, not S. And we need [3] to be S.

I think I found one: ""CAUSE"" has [3] as S? 
C A U S E: 
[0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:U, [3]:S, [4]:E -> yes, but [4] is E which is eliminated.

- ""PAUSE"": same issue.

- ""TASTE"": T A S T E -> 
  [0]:T, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> [3] is T, not S.

- ""BASTE"": same as TASTE.

- ""PASTE"": P A S T E -> 
  [0]:P, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> [3] is T.

I need to find a word where the fourth letter (index 3) is S.

For example:
- ""GASPS"": G A S P S -> 
  [0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:P, [4]:S -> [3] is P.

- ""CLASS"": C L A S S -> 
  [0]:C, [1]:L, [2]:A, [3]:S, [4]:S -> but [1] is L, not A. We need [1] to be A.

We need [1] to be A and [3] to be S.

So, the word must have:
- The second letter (index 1) is A.
- The fourth letter (index 3) is S.

So, the structure: 
Letter0: ?
Letter1: A
Letter2: ?
Letter3: S
Letter4: ?

And the word must not contain R, I, E.

Let me search my vocabulary:

- ""DAISY"": D A I S Y -> 
  [0]:D, [1]:A, [2]:I, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> but I is eliminated (from first feedback: I is not in the word). So we cannot use I.

- ""HASTY"": H A S T Y -> 
  [0]:H, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:Y -> [3] is T, not S.

- ""NASTY"": N A S T Y -> same, [3] is T.

- ""PASTY"": P A S T Y -> same.

- ""TANSY"": T A N S Y -> 
  [0]:T, [1]:A, [2]:N, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> yes! [3] is S.

So, ""TANSY"" is a word? It means a type of plant. But is it common? In Wordle, the word list might include it.

But let's check the letters: T, A, N, S, Y. 
- T: not eliminated
- A: we know is in
- N: new
- S: we know is in
- Y: new

And it doesn't contain R, I, E.

So, ""TANSY"" fits the pattern and uses new letters.

Another word: ""MANGO"" doesn't have S at position 4.

""BASSO"" is not common.

""CASAS"": C A S A S -> 
  [0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:A, [4]:S -> [3] is A, not S.

""LASSI"": L A S S I -> 
  [0]:L, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:I -> [3] is S, but [4] is I which is eliminated.

""PASHA"": P A S H A -> 
  [0]:P, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:H, [4]:A -> [3] is H.

I think ""TANSY"" is a candidate.

Another one: ""JASPS"" is not common.

Or ""VASAL"", but [3] is A.

Perhaps ""TAWSE"", but has E.

I think ""TANSY"" is acceptable.

But note: we are allowed to guess any valid 5-letter word, not necessarily one that fits the known positions. However, it's efficient to use the known positions to test other letters.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that doesn't have A in position 2 and S in position 4, but that would waste the known information. It's better to use them to get more information about the other positions.

So, I'll go with ""TANSY"".

But let me confirm: TANSY is a valid word? Yes, it's in the dictionary.

So, guess: TANSY

We hope to get feedback that tells us about T, N, Y and also confirms A and S (which we already know).

But note: we know A and S are in the word, but in TANSY, A is at position 2 and S is at position 4, which are the correct positions? We know they are correct, so we expect them to be marked as correct.

However, the feedback might show:
- T: ? 
- A: should be ✓
- N: ?
- S: should be ✓
- Y: ?

But the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but in this case, TANSY has unique letters.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that has different letters to test more.

But with the constraints, TANSY is a good choice.

Another common word: ""PASTA"" doesn't fit because [3] is T.

Or ""MASTA"" not a word.

I think TANSY is fine.

But let me think of a more common word: ""HASTY"" doesn't have S at [3].

What about ""BASES"": B A S E S -> 
  [0]:B, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:E, [4]:S -> [3] is E, eliminated.

""CASES"": same.

""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> 
  [0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> [3] is S! Yes.

So, ""GASSY"" is a word. It means containing gas or gaseous.

Letters: G, A, S, S, Y. 
- G: new
- A: known
- S: known (but we have two S's)
- Y: new

But note: the feedback for the first guess said S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4). It didn't say anything about multiple S's. So there could be multiple S's.

In ""GASSY"", we have S at position 2 and 3? 
[0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:Y

So position 4 is [3] which is S, so that matches. And position 2 is A, which matches.

But we have an extra S at position 2? [2] is S.

The secret word might have an S at position 3? We don't know.

But in our first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was correct. We didn't have S at position 3 in the first guess (we had I at position 3). So we don't know about position 3.

So ""GASSY"" is also a candidate.

But ""GASSY"" has two S's. It might be a good test because if the secret word has only one S, then one of the S's in GASSY might be marked as wrong position or not present? But we know position 4 must be S, so the S at position 3 in GASSY might be additional.

But to avoid complexity, maybe a word with unique letters is better. TANSY has unique letters.

However, TANSY is less common. Let me see if there's a more common word.

Another word: ""PAYSA"" not a word.

""TASSA"" not common.

""CANST"": C A N S T -> 
  [0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:N, [3]:S, [4]:T -> yes! [3] is S.

""CANST"" is an archaic word for can or container, but might be in the word list.

""HASTY"" doesn't work.

""NASTY"" doesn't work.

""PASTY"" doesn't work.

""RASTA"" has R, which is eliminated.

I think ""TANSY"" or ""GASSY"" or ""CANST"" are options.

But ""GASSY"" is in the Wordle word list, I believe.

To maximize new letters, TANSY has T, N, Y which are new.

GASSY has G and Y, but S is repeated.

Since we have limited guesses, I'd prefer to test more new letters.

So, I'll go with ""TANSY"".

But let me check: in the first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was correct. In TANSY, we are putting S at position 4 again, which is safe because we know it's correct. And A at position 2 is also correct.

The new letters are T at 1, N at 3, Y at 5.

So, after this guess, we will know about T, N, Y.

Therefore, I choose ""TANSY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, I, and E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the correct position (position 2).
- S is in the correct position (position 4).

The secret word must have the form: _ A _ S _, and it cannot contain R, I, or E. For the second guess, I chose ""TANSY"" because:
- It fits the known pattern (A at position 2, S at position 4).
- It introduces new common letters (T, N, Y) that haven't been tested yet.
- It avoids the eliminated letters (R, I, E).

This guess will help test the presence of T, N, and Y, and confirm the positions of A and S.

We should try to use a word that:\n- Has the second letter as A and the fourth letter as S (to confirm or get more information, but note we already know these are fixed, so we can use them to test other positions).\n- Includes other common letters that haven\'t been tried yet (avoiding R, I, E).\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\nWe can try to form a word that fits the pattern _ A _ S _ and uses new letters.\n\nBut note: our guess doesn\'t have to have A in the second and S in the fourth? Actually, we can, but we might also choose to test other positions. However, since we know A and S are in those positions, we can use them to help us find the other letters.\n\nLet me think of words that have the form _ A _ S _ and do not contain R, I, E.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- TANS: but that\'s 4 letters, we need 5. So, TANSY? Not common. \n- We need 5-letter words.\n\nCommon words:\n- TASKS: T A S K S -> but the fourth letter is K, not S? Wait, let\'s break down: \n  Position: 1: T, 2: A, 3: S, 4: K, 5: S -> that doesn\'t fit because we need S at the fourth position, but here the fourth is K and fifth is S. Also, we have S at the third and fifth, but we know the fourth is S, so that might be acceptable? Actually, the pattern is _ A _ S _, so:\n  Position 1: any\n  Position 2: A\n  Position 3: any\n  Position 4: S\n  Position 5: any\n\nSo, TASKS: \n- Position 1: T\n- Position 2: A -> good\n- Position 3: S -> but we don\'t know about position 3, so that\'s okay\n- Position 4: K -> but we need S at position 4? Wait, no: in TASKS, the fourth letter is K (if we count: 1:T, 2:A, 3:S, 4:K, 5:S). So the fourth letter is K, not S. So that doesn\'t match.\n\nWe need a word where the fourth letter is S. So the pattern is: \nLetter1: ?, Letter2: A, Letter3: ?, Letter4: S, Letter5: ?\n\nExamples:\n- CLASS: C L A S S -> but that\'s A at position 3, not 2. So no.\n- PASTA: P A S T A -> but then position 3 is S, but we need position 4 to be S? \n  Let\'s break: \n  P (1), A (2), S (3), T (4), A (5) -> so position 4 is T, not S.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be S. So:\n\n- GAWKS: G A W K S -> position 4 is K, not S.\n- BASTS: B A S T S -> position 4 is T? \n  B(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), S(5) -> position 4 is T.\n\nI think I\'m having trouble. Let me think of words ending with S? But we need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the fourth letter as S, meaning the last two letters are the fifth and the fourth is S? Not necessarily, because the fifth can be anything.\n\nActually, the word must have the structure: \n[letter1] A [letter3] S [letter5]\n\nSo, for example:\n- MASTS: M A S T S -> \n  M(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), S(5) -> but position 4 is T, not S. We need position 4 to be S? \n  Wait, no: in MASTS, the letters are: \n  Position 1: M\n  Position 2: A\n  Position 3: S\n  Position 4: T\n  Position 5: S\n\nThat doesn\'t have S at position 4.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be S. So the word must have the fourth character as S. \n\nFor example:\n- The word ""PASS"" is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.\n\nLet me think of 5-letter words with S at the fourth position and A at the second.\n\nExamples:\n- CAUSE: C A U S E -> \n  C(1), A(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E is already eliminated (from first feedback: E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.\n\n- FEAST: F E A S T -> \n  F(1), E(2), A(3), S(4), T(5) -> but position 2 is E, not A. We need A at position 2.\n\nWe need A at position 2 and S at position 4.\n\nSo:\n- Letter1: ?\n- Letter2: A\n- Letter3: ?\n- Letter4: S\n- Letter5: ?\n\nAnd the word must not contain R, I, E.\n\nPossible words:\n- HASTY: H A S T Y -> \n  H(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but position 4 is T, not S. We need position 4 to be S, so the third letter is free, but the fourth must be S.\n\nIn HASTY, the fourth letter is T, not S.\n\nI think I\'m making a mistake. Let me clarify: the fourth letter must be S, so in the word, the character at index 3 (if we start counting at 0) or index 4? \n\nIn the feedback, we count positions starting from 1.\n\nFor the word ""RAISE"":\n- R is position 1\n- A is position 2\n- I is position 3\n- S is position 4\n- E is position 5\n\nSo, the feedback said A is correct at position 2 and S is correct at position 4.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n- Position 1: unknown, but not R (since R is not in the word)\n- Position 2: A\n- Position 3: unknown, but not I (since I is not in the word)\n- Position 4: S\n- Position 5: unknown, but not E\n\nSo the pattern is: [not R, not I, not E] A [not R, not I, not E] S [not R, not I, not E]\n\nNow, we need to find a word that fits: _ A _ S _\n\nAnd we must avoid the letters R, I, E.\n\nLet me list some words that fit this pattern:\n\n- TALKS: T A L K S -> \n  Position 1: T, 2: A, 3: L, 4: K, 5: S -> but position 4 is K, not S. We need position 4 to be S.\n\n- We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the fourth character as S.\n\nExamples of words with second letter A and fourth letter S:\n\n- GAZES: but has E and Z? And E is eliminated.\n- JAZZY: J A Z Z Y -> position 4 is Z, not S.\n- I\'m struggling. Let me think of common words.\n\nAnother idea: ""BASIS"" -> B A S I S -> \n  B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5) -> but position 4 is I, not S. And I is eliminated.\n\n""CASKS"": C A S K S -> \n  C(1), A(2), S(3), K(4), S(5) -> position 4 is K.\n\n""PASSE"": P A S S E -> \n  P(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E is eliminated.\n\n""MASSE"": same issue with E.\n\n""WASPS"": W A S P S -> \n  W(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), S(5) -> position 4 is P.\n\nI need to look for words where the fourth letter is S. That means the word has the structure: ??A?S? but with the fourth letter being the fourth character.\n\nActually, the fourth character is the one at index 3 (if we index from 0). So in a 5-letter word, the positions are:\nIndex 0: first letter\nIndex 1: second letter\nIndex 2: third letter\nIndex 3: fourth letter\nIndex 4: fifth letter\n\nWe need:\nIndex 1: A\nIndex 3: S\n\nSo, the word: [0] A [2] S [4]\n\nAnd [0], [2], [4] cannot be R, I, E, and also not the letters we know are absent.\n\nNow, let me think of words:\n\n- ""HASTE"": H A S T E -> \n  [0]:H, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> but [3] is T, not S. And we need [3] to be S.\n\nI think I found one: ""CAUSE"" has [3] as S? \nC A U S E: \n[0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:U, [3]:S, [4]:E -> yes, but [4] is E which is eliminated.\n\n- ""PAUSE"": same issue.\n\n- ""TASTE"": T A S T E -> \n  [0]:T, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> [3] is T, not S.\n\n- ""BASTE"": same as TASTE.\n\n- ""PASTE"": P A S T E -> \n  [0]:P, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> [3] is T.\n\nI need to find a word where the fourth letter (index 3) is S.\n\nFor example:\n- ""GASPS"": G A S P S -> \n  [0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:P, [4]:S -> [3] is P.\n\n- ""CLASS"": C L A S S -> \n  [0]:C, [1]:L, [2]:A, [3]:S, [4]:S -> but [1] is L, not A.

So we cannot use I.\n\n- ""HASTY"": H A S T Y -> \n  [0]:H, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:Y -> [3] is T, not S.\n\n- ""NASTY"": N A S T Y -> same, [3] is T.\n\n- ""PASTY"": P A S T Y -> same.\n\n- ""TANSY"": T A N S Y -> \n  [0]:T, [1]:A, [2]:N, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> yes!

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so position 2 is A)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so position 4 is S)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: TANSY
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, position 2 is A, confirmed again)
- N: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, position 4 is S, confirmed again)
- Y: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so position 5 is Y)

So, from the feedback, we now know:
- The secret word has the second letter A, fourth letter S, and fifth letter Y. So the pattern is: _ A _ S Y
- We also know that the letters R, I, E, T, N are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter1] A [letter3] S Y

And we need to find letter1 and letter3, which cannot be R, I, E, T, N, and also not any other eliminated letters. Currently, eliminated letters are: R, I, E, T, N.

We have two positions to guess: position 1 and position 3.

We need to make a third guess. We should choose a word that fits the pattern and uses new letters to test for position 1 and 3.

The pattern: [1] A [3] S Y

We know position 1 and 3 must be filled with letters not in the eliminated set.

Common letters that haven't been tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (but note, we have to form a valid word).

We need to find a word that has the form: [1] A [3] S Y

Let's think of possible words:

- DAISY: but D A I S Y -> I is eliminated, so not allowed.
- HAWKS: H A W K S -> but the last letter is S, not Y, and we need Y at the end. Also, the pattern requires S at position 4 and Y at 5, so HAWKS ends with KS, not SY.
- We need the word to end with ""SY"".

So, the last three letters are A (at 2), then S (at 4), and Y (at 5). But note: position 3 is between A and S, so the word has: letter1, then A, then letter3, then S, then Y.

So the word is: [1]A[3]SY

Examples:
- DAISY: D A I S Y -> but I is eliminated.
- PANSY: P A N S Y -> but N is eliminated (from guess 2, N is not in the word).
- MOSSY: M O S S Y -> but position 2 is O, not A.
- JAZZY: J A Z Z Y -> but then position 3 is Z, position 4 is Z, not S. We need position 4 to be S.

We need position 4 to be S, so the word must have S at the fourth position and Y at the fifth.

So, the third letter (position 3) is before the S, so the word has: [1] A [3] S Y

Possible words:
- ""HASPY"" - not a common word.
- ""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> but then position 3 is S, and position 4 is S. So the word is G A S S Y. 
  - This has S at position 3 and S at position 4. But we know position 4 is S, so that's fine. However, in this case, position 3 is also S. But we don't know if the word has two S's or not.

But in ""GASSY"", the pattern is:
  Position 1: G
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: S
  Position 4: S
  Position 5: Y

But we know position 4 is S, so if we guess GASSY, then:
- Position 2: A is correct (we know)
- Position 4: S is correct (we know)
- Position 5: Y is correct (we know from guess 2)

But we are testing position 1 (G) and position 3 (S). However, if the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 3 might be marked as absent or wrong position? But we know position 4 has S, so if there is only one S, then the S at position 3 would be extra and might be marked as not present? But actually, in Wordle, if there is only one S and it is at position 4, then the S at position 3 would be marked as absent (x) because the single S is already used at position 4.

But in our case, we know position 4 is S, so if the secret word has another S, then it might be possible.

Alternatively, we can avoid using S at position 3 to not complicate.

But let's list possible words ending with ""SY"" and having A at position 2.

The only common word I can think of is ""DANDY"" but that doesn't have S.

Another one: ""LASSY"" - but L A S S Y, same as GASSY.

Or ""MASSY"": M A S S Y.

But these all have S at position 3.

What about ""PALSY"": P A L S Y -> 
  Position 1: P
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: L
  Position 4: S
  Position 5: Y

Yes! This fits perfectly: P A L S Y.

And L is a new letter, not eliminated.

Similarly, ""BALSY"" - not a word.

""JALSY"" - not a word.

""WALSY"" - not common.

So ""PALSY"" is a valid word, meaning a condition.

Another one: ""HALSY"" - not common.

""GAYLY"" - G A Y L Y -> but position 3 is Y, and position 5 is Y, but we need position 4 to be S, which it's not.

So, ""PALSY"" seems a good candidate.

Another possibility: ""FANCY"" but no S.

We need the fourth letter to be S, so it must be ...S at the end, but with Y at the end, so ...SY.

So, the only common words I can think of are those with double S like GASSY, MASSY, or PALSY.

But PALSY has L at position 3.

Also, ""DAISY"" is out because of I.

So, I think ""PALSY"" is a good guess.

We can also consider ""HASTY"", but H A S T Y -> position 4 is T, not S. We need position 4 to be S.

No, we know position 4 is S, so we must have S at position 4.

So, let's go with ""PALSY"".

In ""PALSY"":
- P: new letter
- A: known correct
- L: new letter
- S: known correct
- Y: known correct

We are testing P and L.

If the secret word is ""PALSY"", then we win.

Otherwise, we get feedback on P and L.

But note: we have only two positions unknown, so we might solve it in this guess or the next.

Another word: ""JAZZY"" doesn't have S.

Or ""BUSKY"" not common.

I think ""PALSY"" is acceptable.

But let me confirm if there are other options.

""CASKY"" not a word.

""BASSO"" doesn't end with Y.

We know the word ends with Y, because position 5 is Y.

So, the word must end with SY.

Other words: ""MOSSY"" has O at position 2, not A.

""FUSSY"" has U at position 2.

So, ""PALSY"" seems the best.

We could guess a word that doesn't have A, S, Y in their positions to test more letters, but that would be inefficient because we know those positions are fixed. It's better to use the known positions to focus on the unknown ones.

So, I'll go with ""PALSY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: A is correct and in position 2, S is correct and in position 4. R, I, and E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (TANSY)**: A (position 2), S (position 4), and Y (position 5) are correct. T and N are absent.

The secret word must have the pattern: `_ A _ S Y`, with positions 2, 4, and 5 confirmed. Absent letters are R, I, E, T, and N.

For the third guess, I chose **PALSY** because:
- It fits the known pattern (A at position 2, S at position 4, Y at position 5).
- It tests new common letters (P and L) for the unknown positions (1 and 3).
- It avoids all eliminated letters (R, I, E, T, N).

This guess will help identify if P or L is in the word and their positions, bringing us closer to solving the puzzle.

<guess>PALSY</guess>",PALSY,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so position 2 is A)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so position 4 is S)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: TANSY
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, position 2 is A, confirmed again)
- N: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, position 4 is S, confirmed again)
- Y: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so position 5 is Y)

So, from the feedback, we now know:
- The secret word has the second letter A, fourth letter S, and fifth letter Y. So the pattern is: _ A _ S Y
- We also know that the letters R, I, E, T, N are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter1] A [letter3] S Y

And we need to find letter1 and letter3, which cannot be R, I, E, T, N, and also not any other eliminated letters. Currently, eliminated letters are: R, I, E, T, N.

We have two positions to guess: position 1 and position 3.

We need to make a third guess. We should choose a word that fits the pattern and uses new letters to test for position 1 and 3.

The pattern: [1] A [3] S Y

We know position 1 and 3 must be filled with letters not in the eliminated set.

Common letters that haven't been tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (but note, we have to form a valid word).

We need to find a word that has the form: [1] A [3] S Y

Let's think of possible words:

- DAISY: but D A I S Y -> I is eliminated, so not allowed.
- HAWKS: H A W K S -> but the last letter is S, not Y, and we need Y at the end. Also, the pattern requires S at position 4 and Y at 5, so HAWKS ends with KS, not SY.
- We need the word to end with ""SY"".

So, the last three letters are A (at 2), then S (at 4), and Y (at 5). But note: position 3 is between A and S, so the word has: letter1, then A, then letter3, then S, then Y.

So the word is: [1]A[3]SY

Examples:
- DAISY: D A I S Y -> but I is eliminated.
- PANSY: P A N S Y -> but N is eliminated (from guess 2, N is not in the word).
- MOSSY: M O S S Y -> but position 2 is O, not A.
- JAZZY: J A Z Z Y -> but then position 3 is Z, position 4 is Z, not S. We need position 4 to be S.

We need position 4 to be S, so the word must have S at the fourth position and Y at the fifth.

So, the third letter (position 3) is before the S, so the word has: [1] A [3] S Y

Possible words:
- ""HASPY"" - not a common word.
- ""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> but then position 3 is S, and position 4 is S. So the word is G A S S Y. 
  - This has S at position 3 and S at position 4. But we know position 4 is S, so that's fine. However, in this case, position 3 is also S. But we don't know if the word has two S's or not.

But in ""GASSY"", the pattern is:
  Position 1: G
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: S
  Position 4: S
  Position 5: Y

But we know position 4 is S, so if we guess GASSY, then:
- Position 2: A is correct (we know)
- Position 4: S is correct (we know)
- Position 5: Y is correct (we know from guess 2)

But we are testing position 1 (G) and position 3 (S). However, if the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 3 might be marked as absent or wrong position? But we know position 4 has S, so if there is only one S, then the S at position 3 would be extra and might be marked as not present?

And L is a new letter, not eliminated.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 However, note that the example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we can choose any valid 5-letter word.

 Let me choose a word that has a set of common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 But note: the example secret word was ""BRISK"", so let's not base our choice on that.

 Alternatively, I can choose ""ROAST"" or ""SLATE"". However, I recall that ""RAISE"" is also a good starting word because it has three vowels and common consonants.

 Since we are at the first guess, any of these are acceptable.

 I'll choose: ""RAISE""

 Why?
 - It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
 - It covers a good set of letters.

 So, my first guess is ""RAISE"".I am starting the game and need to make my first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a word with common letters to maximize information. A good starting word typically includes frequent vowels and consonants. I'll use ""RAISE"" because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), covering a broad range of possibilities. This should help narrow down the secret word effectively.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so the second letter of the secret word is A)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so the fourth letter of the secret word is S)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter is A (position 2).
- The fourth letter is S (position 4).
- The letters R, I, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ A _ S _

We also know that the word does not contain R, I, E.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should try to use a word that:
- Has the second letter as A and the fourth letter as S (to confirm or get more information, but note we already know these are fixed, so we can use them to test other positions).
- Includes other common letters that haven't been tried yet (avoiding R, I, E).

Common letters we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to form a word that fits the pattern _ A _ S _ and uses new letters.

But note: our guess doesn't have to have A in the second and S in the fourth? Actually, we can, but we might also choose to test other positions. However, since we know A and S are in those positions, we can use them to help us find the other letters.

Let me think of words that have the form _ A _ S _ and do not contain R, I, E.

Some possibilities:
- TANS: but that's 4 letters, we need 5. So, TANSY? Not common. 
- We need 5-letter words.

Common words:
- TASKS: T A S K S -> but the fourth letter is K, not S? Wait, let's break down: 
  Position: 1: T, 2: A, 3: S, 4: K, 5: S -> that doesn't fit because we need S at the fourth position, but here the fourth is K and fifth is S. Also, we have S at the third and fifth, but we know the fourth is S, so that might be acceptable? Actually, the pattern is _ A _ S _, so:
  Position 1: any
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: any
  Position 4: S
  Position 5: any

So, TASKS: 
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: A -> good
- Position 3: S -> but we don't know about position 3, so that's okay
- Position 4: K -> but we need S at position 4? Wait, no: in TASKS, the fourth letter is K (if we count: 1:T, 2:A, 3:S, 4:K, 5:S). So the fourth letter is K, not S. So that doesn't match.

We need a word where the fourth letter is S. So the pattern is: 
Letter1: ?, Letter2: A, Letter3: ?, Letter4: S, Letter5: ?

Examples:
- CLASS: C L A S S -> but that's A at position 3, not 2. So no.
- PASTA: P A S T A -> but then position 3 is S, but we need position 4 to be S? 
  Let's break: 
  P (1), A (2), S (3), T (4), A (5) -> so position 4 is T, not S.

We need the fourth letter to be S. So:

- GAWKS: G A W K S -> position 4 is K, not S.
- BASTS: B A S T S -> position 4 is T? 
  B(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), S(5) -> position 4 is T.

I think I'm having trouble. Let me think of words ending with S? But we need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the fourth letter as S, meaning the last two letters are the fifth and the fourth is S? Not necessarily, because the fifth can be anything.

Actually, the word must have the structure: 
[letter1] A [letter3] S [letter5]

So, for example:
- MASTS: M A S T S -> 
  M(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), S(5) -> but position 4 is T, not S. We need position 4 to be S? 
  Wait, no: in MASTS, the letters are: 
  Position 1: M
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: S
  Position 4: T
  Position 5: S

That doesn't have S at position 4.

We need the fourth letter to be S. So the word must have the fourth character as S. 

For example:
- The word ""PASS"" is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

Let me think of 5-letter words with S at the fourth position and A at the second.

Examples:
- CAUSE: C A U S E -> 
  C(1), A(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E is already eliminated (from first feedback: E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.

- FEAST: F E A S T -> 
  F(1), E(2), A(3), S(4), T(5) -> but position 2 is E, not A. We need A at position 2.

We need A at position 2 and S at position 4.

So:
- Letter1: ?
- Letter2: A
- Letter3: ?
- Letter4: S
- Letter5: ?

And the word must not contain R, I, E.

Possible words:
- HASTY: H A S T Y -> 
  H(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but position 4 is T, not S. We need position 4 to be S, so the third letter is free, but the fourth must be S.

In HASTY, the fourth letter is T, not S.

I think I'm making a mistake. Let me clarify: the fourth letter must be S, so in the word, the character at index 3 (if we start counting at 0) or index 4? 

In the feedback, we count positions starting from 1.

For the word ""RAISE"":
- R is position 1
- A is position 2
- I is position 3
- S is position 4
- E is position 5

So, the feedback said A is correct at position 2 and S is correct at position 4.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 1: unknown, but not R (since R is not in the word)
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: unknown, but not I (since I is not in the word)
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: unknown, but not E

So the pattern is: [not R, not I, not E] A [not R, not I, not E] S [not R, not I, not E]

Now, we need to find a word that fits: _ A _ S _

And we must avoid the letters R, I, E.

Let me list some words that fit this pattern:

- TALKS: T A L K S -> 
  Position 1: T, 2: A, 3: L, 4: K, 5: S -> but position 4 is K, not S. We need position 4 to be S.

- We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the fourth character as S.

Examples of words with second letter A and fourth letter S:

- GAZES: but has E and Z? And E is eliminated.
- JAZZY: J A Z Z Y -> position 4 is Z, not S.
- I'm struggling. Let me think of common words.

Another idea: ""BASIS"" -> B A S I S -> 
  B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5) -> but position 4 is I, not S. And I is eliminated.

""CASKS"": C A S K S -> 
  C(1), A(2), S(3), K(4), S(5) -> position 4 is K.

""PASSE"": P A S S E -> 
  P(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E is eliminated.

""MASSE"": same issue with E.

""WASPS"": W A S P S -> 
  W(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), S(5) -> position 4 is P.

I need to look for words where the fourth letter is S. That means the word has the structure: ??A?S? but with the fourth letter being the fourth character.

Actually, the fourth character is the one at index 3 (if we index from 0). So in a 5-letter word, the positions are:
Index 0: first letter
Index 1: second letter
Index 2: third letter
Index 3: fourth letter
Index 4: fifth letter

We need:
Index 1: A
Index 3: S

So, the word: [0] A [2] S [4]

And [0], [2], [4] cannot be R, I, E, and also not the letters we know are absent.

Now, let me think of words:

- ""HASTE"": H A S T E -> 
  [0]:H, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> but [3] is T, not S. And we need [3] to be S.

I think I found one: ""CAUSE"" has [3] as S? 
C A U S E: 
[0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:U, [3]:S, [4]:E -> yes, but [4] is E which is eliminated.

- ""PAUSE"": same issue.

- ""TASTE"": T A S T E -> 
  [0]:T, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> [3] is T, not S.

- ""BASTE"": same as TASTE.

- ""PASTE"": P A S T E -> 
  [0]:P, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> [3] is T.

I need to find a word where the fourth letter (index 3) is S.

For example:
- ""GASPS"": G A S P S -> 
  [0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:P, [4]:S -> [3] is P.

- ""CLASS"": C L A S S -> 
  [0]:C, [1]:L, [2]:A, [3]:S, [4]:S -> but [1] is L, not A. We need [1] to be A.

We need [1] to be A and [3] to be S.

So, the word must have:
- The second letter (index 1) is A.
- The fourth letter (index 3) is S.

So, the structure: 
Letter0: ?
Letter1: A
Letter2: ?
Letter3: S
Letter4: ?

And the word must not contain R, I, E.

Let me search my vocabulary:

- ""DAISY"": D A I S Y -> 
  [0]:D, [1]:A, [2]:I, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> but I is eliminated (from first feedback: I is not in the word). So we cannot use I.

- ""HASTY"": H A S T Y -> 
  [0]:H, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:Y -> [3] is T, not S.

- ""NASTY"": N A S T Y -> same, [3] is T.

- ""PASTY"": P A S T Y -> same.

- ""TANSY"": T A N S Y -> 
  [0]:T, [1]:A, [2]:N, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> yes! [3] is S.

So, ""TANSY"" is a word? It means a type of plant. But is it common? In Wordle, the word list might include it.

But let's check the letters: T, A, N, S, Y. 
- T: not eliminated
- A: we know is in
- N: new
- S: we know is in
- Y: new

And it doesn't contain R, I, E.

So, ""TANSY"" fits the pattern and uses new letters.

Another word: ""MANGO"" doesn't have S at position 4.

""BASSO"" is not common.

""CASAS"": C A S A S -> 
  [0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:A, [4]:S -> [3] is A, not S.

""LASSI"": L A S S I -> 
  [0]:L, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:I -> [3] is S, but [4] is I which is eliminated.

""PASHA"": P A S H A -> 
  [0]:P, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:H, [4]:A -> [3] is H.

I think ""TANSY"" is a candidate.

Another one: ""JASPS"" is not common.

Or ""VASAL"", but [3] is A.

Perhaps ""TAWSE"", but has E.

I think ""TANSY"" is acceptable.

But note: we are allowed to guess any valid 5-letter word, not necessarily one that fits the known positions. However, it's efficient to use the known positions to test other letters.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that doesn't have A in position 2 and S in position 4, but that would waste the known information. It's better to use them to get more information about the other positions.

So, I'll go with ""TANSY"".

But let me confirm: TANSY is a valid word? Yes, it's in the dictionary.

So, guess: TANSY

We hope to get feedback that tells us about T, N, Y and also confirms A and S (which we already know).

But note: we know A and S are in the word, but in TANSY, A is at position 2 and S is at position 4, which are the correct positions? We know they are correct, so we expect them to be marked as correct.

However, the feedback might show:
- T: ? 
- A: should be ✓
- N: ?
- S: should be ✓
- Y: ?

But the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but in this case, TANSY has unique letters.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that has different letters to test more.

But with the constraints, TANSY is a good choice.

Another common word: ""PASTA"" doesn't fit because [3] is T.

Or ""MASTA"" not a word.

I think TANSY is fine.

But let me think of a more common word: ""HASTY"" doesn't have S at [3].

What about ""BASES"": B A S E S -> 
  [0]:B, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:E, [4]:S -> [3] is E, eliminated.

""CASES"": same.

""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> 
  [0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> [3] is S! Yes.

So, ""GASSY"" is a word. It means containing gas or gaseous.

Letters: G, A, S, S, Y. 
- G: new
- A: known
- S: known (but we have two S's)
- Y: new

But note: the feedback for the first guess said S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4). It didn't say anything about multiple S's. So there could be multiple S's.

In ""GASSY"", we have S at position 2 and 3? 
[0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:Y

So position 4 is [3] which is S, so that matches. And position 2 is A, which matches.

But we have an extra S at position 2? [2] is S.

The secret word might have an S at position 3? We don't know.

But in our first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was correct. We didn't have S at position 3 in the first guess (we had I at position 3). So we don't know about position 3.

So ""GASSY"" is also a candidate.

But ""GASSY"" has two S's. It might be a good test because if the secret word has only one S, then one of the S's in GASSY might be marked as wrong position or not present? But we know position 4 must be S, so the S at position 3 in GASSY might be additional.

But to avoid complexity, maybe a word with unique letters is better. TANSY has unique letters.

However, TANSY is less common. Let me see if there's a more common word.

Another word: ""PAYSA"" not a word.

""TASSA"" not common.

""CANST"": C A N S T -> 
  [0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:N, [3]:S, [4]:T -> yes! [3] is S.

""CANST"" is an archaic word for can or container, but might be in the word list.

""HASTY"" doesn't work.

""NASTY"" doesn't work.

""PASTY"" doesn't work.

""RASTA"" has R, which is eliminated.

I think ""TANSY"" or ""GASSY"" or ""CANST"" are options.

But ""GASSY"" is in the Wordle word list, I believe.

To maximize new letters, TANSY has T, N, Y which are new.

GASSY has G and Y, but S is repeated.

Since we have limited guesses, I'd prefer to test more new letters.

So, I'll go with ""TANSY"".

But let me check: in the first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was correct. In TANSY, we are putting S at position 4 again, which is safe because we know it's correct. And A at position 2 is also correct.

The new letters are T at 1, N at 3, Y at 5.

So, after this guess, we will know about T, N, Y.

Therefore, I choose ""TANSY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, I, and E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the correct position (position 2).
- S is in the correct position (position 4).

The secret word must have the form: _ A _ S _, and it cannot contain R, I, or E. For the second guess, I chose ""TANSY"" because:
- It fits the known pattern (A at position 2, S at position 4).
- It introduces new common letters (T, N, Y) that haven't been tested yet.
- It avoids the eliminated letters (R, I, E).

This guess will help test the presence of T, N, and Y, and confirm the positions of A and S.

<guess>TANSY</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: TANSY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) N(x) S(✓) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so position 2 is A)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so position 4 is S)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: TANSY
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, position 2 is A, confirmed again)
- N: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, position 4 is S, confirmed again)
- Y: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so position 5 is Y)

So, from the feedback, we now know:
- The secret word has the second letter A, fourth letter S, and fifth letter Y. So the pattern is: _ A _ S Y
- We also know that the letters R, I, E, T, N are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter1] A [letter3] S Y

And we need to find letter1 and letter3, which cannot be R, I, E, T, N, and also not any other eliminated letters. Currently, eliminated letters are: R, I, E, T, N.

We have two positions to guess: position 1 and position 3.

We need to make a third guess. We should choose a word that fits the pattern and uses new letters to test for position 1 and 3.

The pattern: [1] A [3] S Y

We know position 1 and 3 must be filled with letters not in the eliminated set.

Common letters that haven't been tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (but note, we have to form a valid word).

We need to find a word that has the form: [1] A [3] S Y

Let's think of possible words:

- DAISY: but D A I S Y -> I is eliminated, so not allowed.
- HAWKS: H A W K S -> but the last letter is S, not Y, and we need Y at the end. Also, the pattern requires S at position 4 and Y at 5, so HAWKS ends with KS, not SY.
- We need the word to end with ""SY"".

So, the last three letters are A (at 2), then S (at 4), and Y (at 5). But note: position 3 is between A and S, so the word has: letter1, then A, then letter3, then S, then Y.

So the word is: [1]A[3]SY

Examples:
- DAISY: D A I S Y -> but I is eliminated.
- PANSY: P A N S Y -> but N is eliminated (from guess 2, N is not in the word).
- MOSSY: M O S S Y -> but position 2 is O, not A.
- JAZZY: J A Z Z Y -> but then position 3 is Z, position 4 is Z, not S. We need position 4 to be S.

We need position 4 to be S, so the word must have S at the fourth position and Y at the fifth.

So, the third letter (position 3) is before the S, so the word has: [1] A [3] S Y

Possible words:
- ""HASPY"" - not a common word.
- ""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> but then position 3 is S, and position 4 is S. So the word is G A S S Y. 
  - This has S at position 3 and S at position 4. But we know position 4 is S, so that's fine. However, in this case, position 3 is also S. But we don't know if the word has two S's or not.

But in ""GASSY"", the pattern is:
  Position 1: G
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: S
  Position 4: S
  Position 5: Y

But we know position 4 is S, so if we guess GASSY, then:
- Position 2: A is correct (we know)
- Position 4: S is correct (we know)
- Position 5: Y is correct (we know from guess 2)

But we are testing position 1 (G) and position 3 (S). However, if the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 3 might be marked as absent or wrong position? But we know position 4 has S, so if there is only one S, then the S at position 3 would be extra and might be marked as not present? But actually, in Wordle, if there is only one S and it is at position 4, then the S at position 3 would be marked as absent (x) because the single S is already used at position 4.

But in our case, we know position 4 is S, so if the secret word has another S, then it might be possible.

Alternatively, we can avoid using S at position 3 to not complicate.

But let's list possible words ending with ""SY"" and having A at position 2.

The only common word I can think of is ""DANDY"" but that doesn't have S.

Another one: ""LASSY"" - but L A S S Y, same as GASSY.

Or ""MASSY"": M A S S Y.

But these all have S at position 3.

What about ""PALSY"": P A L S Y -> 
  Position 1: P
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: L
  Position 4: S
  Position 5: Y

Yes! This fits perfectly: P A L S Y.

And L is a new letter, not eliminated.

Similarly, ""BALSY"" - not a word.

""JALSY"" - not a word.

""WALSY"" - not common.

So ""PALSY"" is a valid word, meaning a condition.

Another one: ""HALSY"" - not common.

""GAYLY"" - G A Y L Y -> but position 3 is Y, and position 5 is Y, but we need position 4 to be S, which it's not.

So, ""PALSY"" seems a good candidate.

Another possibility: ""FANCY"" but no S.

We need the fourth letter to be S, so it must be ...S at the end, but with Y at the end, so ...SY.

So, the only common words I can think of are those with double S like GASSY, MASSY, or PALSY.

But PALSY has L at position 3.

Also, ""DAISY"" is out because of I.

So, I think ""PALSY"" is a good guess.

We can also consider ""HASTY"", but H A S T Y -> position 4 is T, not S. We need position 4 to be S.

No, we know position 4 is S, so we must have S at position 4.

So, let's go with ""PALSY"".

In ""PALSY"":
- P: new letter
- A: known correct
- L: new letter
- S: known correct
- Y: known correct

We are testing P and L.

If the secret word is ""PALSY"", then we win.

Otherwise, we get feedback on P and L.

But note: we have only two positions unknown, so we might solve it in this guess or the next.

Another word: ""JAZZY"" doesn't have S.

Or ""BUSKY"" not common.

I think ""PALSY"" is acceptable.

But let me confirm if there are other options.

""CASKY"" not a word.

""BASSO"" doesn't end with Y.

We know the word ends with Y, because position 5 is Y.

So, the word must end with SY.

Other words: ""MOSSY"" has O at position 2, not A.

""FUSSY"" has U at position 2.

So, ""PALSY"" seems the best.

We could guess a word that doesn't have A, S, Y in their positions to test more letters, but that would be inefficient because we know those positions are fixed. It's better to use the known positions to focus on the unknown ones.

So, I'll go with ""PALSY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: A is correct and in position 2, S is correct and in position 4. R, I, and E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (TANSY)**: A (position 2), S (position 4), and Y (position 5) are correct. T and N are absent.

The secret word must have the pattern: `_ A _ S Y`, with positions 2, 4, and 5 confirmed. Absent letters are R, I, E, T, and N.

For the third guess, I chose **PALSY** because:
- It fits the known pattern (A at position 2, S at position 4, Y at position 5).
- It tests new common letters (P and L) for the unknown positions (1 and 3).
- It avoids all eliminated letters (R, I, E, T, N).

This guess will help identify if P or L is in the word and their positions, bringing us closer to solving the puzzle.

Not necessarily, because the fifth can be anything.\n\nActually, the word must have the structure: \n[letter1] A [letter3] S [letter5]\n\nSo, for example:\n- MASTS: M A S T S -> \n  M(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), S(5) -> but position 4 is T, not S.

Let me clarify: the fourth letter must be S, so in the word, the character at index 3 (if we start counting at 0) or index 4? \n\nIn the feedback, we count positions starting from 1.\n\nFor the word ""RAISE"":\n- R is position 1\n- A is position 2\n- I is position 3\n- S is position 4\n- E is position 5\n\nSo, the feedback said A is correct at position 2 and S is correct at position 4.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n- Position 1: unknown, but not R (since R is not in the word)\n- Position 2: A\n- Position 3: unknown, but not I (since I is not in the word)\n- Position 4: S\n- Position 5: unknown, but not E\n\nSo the pattern is: [not R, not I, not E] A [not R, not I, not E] S [not R, not I, not E]\n\nNow, we need to find a word that fits: _ A _ S _\n\nAnd we must avoid the letters R, I, E.\n\nLet me list some words that fit this pattern:\n\n- TALKS: T A L K S -> \n  Position 1: T, 2: A, 3: L, 4: K, 5: S -> but position 4 is K, not S. We need position 4 to be S.\n\n- We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the fourth character as S.\n\nExamples of words with second letter A and fourth letter S:\n\n- GAZES: but has E and Z? And E is eliminated.\n- JAZZY: J A Z Z Y -> position 4 is Z, not S.\n- I\'m struggling. Let me think of common words.\n\nAnother idea: ""BASIS"" -> B A S I S -> \n  B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5) -> but position 4 is I, not S. And I is eliminated.\n\n""CASKS"": C A S K S -> \n  C(1), A(2), S(3), K(4), S(5) -> position 4 is K.\n\n""PASSE"": P A S S E -> \n  P(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E is eliminated.\n\n""MASSE"": same issue with E.\n\n""WASPS"": W A S P S -> \n  W(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), S(5) -> position 4 is P.\n\nI need to look for words where the fourth letter is S. That means the word has the structure: ??A?S? but with the fourth letter being the fourth character.\n\nActually, the fourth character is the one at index 3 (if we index from 0). So in a 5-letter word, the positions are:\nIndex 0: first letter\nIndex 1: second letter\nIndex 2: third letter\nIndex 3: fourth letter\nIndex 4: fifth letter\n\nWe need:\nIndex 1: A\nIndex 3: S\n\nSo, the word: [0] A [2] S [4]\n\nAnd [0], [2], [4] cannot be R, I, E, and also not the letters we know are absent.\n\nNow, let me think of words:\n\n- ""HASTE"": H A S T E -> \n  [0]:H, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> but [3] is T, not S. And we need [3] to be S.\n\nI think I found one: ""CAUSE"" has [3] as S? \nC A U S E: \n[0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:U, [3]:S, [4]:E -> yes, but [4] is E which is eliminated.\n\n- ""PAUSE"": same issue.\n\n- ""TASTE"": T A S T E -> \n  [0]:T, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> [3] is T, not S.\n\n- ""BASTE"": same as TASTE.\n\n- ""PASTE"": P A S T E -> \n  [0]:P, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> [3] is T.\n\nI need to find a word where the fourth letter (index 3) is S.\n\nFor example:\n- ""GASPS"": G A S P S -> \n  [0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:P, [4]:S -> [3] is P.\n\n- ""CLASS"": C L A S S -> \n  [0]:C, [1]:L, [2]:A, [3]:S, [4]:S -> but [1] is L, not A. We need [1] to be A.\n\nWe need [1] to be A and [3] to be S.\n\nSo, the word must have:\n- The second letter (index 1) is A.\n- The fourth letter (index 3) is S.\n\nSo, the structure: \nLetter0: ?\nLetter1: A\nLetter2: ?\nLetter3: S\nLetter4: ?\n\nAnd the word must not contain R, I, E.\n\nLet me search my vocabulary:\n\n- ""DAISY"": D A I S Y -> \n  [0]:D, [1]:A, [2]:I, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> but I is eliminated (from first feedback: I is not in the word). So we cannot use I.\n\n- ""HASTY"": H A S T Y -> \n  [0]:H, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:Y -> [3] is T, not S.\n\n- ""NASTY"": N A S T Y -> same, [3] is T.\n\n- ""PASTY"": P A S T Y -> same.\n\n- ""TANSY"": T A N S Y -> \n  [0]:T, [1]:A, [2]:N, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> yes! [3] is S.\n\nSo, ""TANSY"" is a word? It means a type of plant. But is it common? In Wordle, the word list might include it.\n\nBut let\'s check the letters: T, A, N, S, Y. \n- T: not eliminated\n- A: we know is in\n- N: new\n- S: we know is in\n- Y: new\n\nAnd it doesn\'t contain R, I, E.\n\nSo, ""TANSY"" fits the pattern and uses new letters.\n\nAnother word: ""MANGO"" doesn\'t have S at position 4.\n\n""BASSO"" is not common.\n\n""CASAS"": C A S A S -> \n  [0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:A, [4]:S -> [3] is A, not S.\n\n""LASSI"": L A S S I -> \n  [0]:L, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:I -> [3] is S, but [4] is I which is eliminated.\n\n""PASHA"": P A S H A -> \n  [0]:P, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:H, [4]:A -> [3] is H.\n\nI think ""TANSY"" is a candidate.\n\nAnother one: ""JASPS"" is not common.\n\nOr ""VASAL"", but [3] is A.\n\nPerhaps ""TAWSE"", but has E.\n\nI think ""TANSY"" is acceptable.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to guess any valid 5-letter word, not necessarily one that fits the known positions. However, it\'s efficient to use the known positions to test other letters.\n\nAlternatively, we might choose a word that doesn\'t have A in position 2 and S in position 4, but that would waste the known information. It\'s better to use them to get more information about the other positions.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""TANSY"".\n\nBut let me confirm: TANSY is a valid word? Yes, it\'s in the dictionary.\n\nSo, guess: TANSY\n\nWe hope to get feedback that tells us about T, N, Y and also confirms A and S (which we already know).\n\nBut note: we know A and S are in the word, but in TANSY, A is at position 2 and S is at position 4, which are the correct positions? We know they are correct, so we expect them to be marked as correct.\n\nHowever, the feedback might show:\n- T: ? \n- A: should be ✓\n- N: ?\n- S: should be ✓\n- Y: ?\n\nBut the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know, but in this case, TANSY has unique letters.\n\nAlternatively, we might choose a word that has different letters to test more.\n\nBut with the constraints, TANSY is a good choice.\n\nAnother common word: ""PASTA"" doesn\'t fit because [3] is T.\n\nOr ""MASTA"" not a word.\n\nI think TANSY is fine.\n\nBut let me think of a more common word: ""HASTY"" doesn\'t have S at [3].\n\nWhat about ""BASES"": B A S E S -> \n  [0]:B, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:E, [4]:S -> [3] is E, eliminated.\n\n""CASES"": same.\n\n""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> \n  [0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> [3] is S! Yes.\n\nSo, ""GASSY"" is a word. It means containing gas or gaseous.\n\nLetters: G, A, S, S, Y. \n- G: new\n- A: known\n- S: known (but we have two S\'s)\n- Y: new\n\nBut note: the feedback for the first guess said S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4). It didn\'t say anything about multiple S\'s. So there could be multiple S\'s.\n\nIn ""GASSY"", we have S at position 2 and 3? \n[0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:Y\n\nSo position 4 is [3] which is S, so that matches. And position 2 is A, which matches.\n\nBut we have an extra S at position 2? [2] is S.\n\nThe secret word might have an S at position 3? We don\'t know.\n\nBut in our first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was correct. We didn\'t have S at position 3 in the first guess (we had I at position 3). So we don\'t know about position 3.\n\nSo ""GASSY"" is also a candidate.\n\nBut ""GASSY"" has two S\'s. It might be a good test because if the secret word has only one S, then one of the S\'s in GASSY might be marked as wrong position or not present? But we know position 4 must be S, so the S at position 3 in GASSY might be additional.\n\nBut to avoid complexity, maybe a word with unique letters is better. TANSY has unique letters.\n\nHowever, TANSY is less common. Let me see if there\'s a more common word.\n\nAnother word: ""PAYSA"" not a word.\n\n""TASSA"" not common.\n\n""CANST"": C A N S T -> \n  [0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:N, [3]:S, [4]:T -> yes! [3] is S.\n\n""CANST"" is an archaic word for can or container, but might be in the word list.\n\n""HASTY"" doesn\'t work.\n\n""NASTY"" doesn\'t work.\n\n""PASTY"" doesn\'t work.\n\n""RASTA"" has R, which is eliminated.\n\nI think ""TANSY"" or ""GASSY"" or ""CANST"" are options.\n\nBut ""GASSY"" is in the Wordle word list, I believe.\n\nTo maximize new letters, TANSY has T, N, Y which are new.\n\nGASSY has G and Y, but S is repeated.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, I\'d prefer to test more new letters.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""TANSY"".\n\nBut let me check: in the first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was correct. In TANSY, we are putting S at position 4 again, which is safe because we know it\'s correct. And A at position 2 is also correct.\n\nThe new letters are T at 1, N at 3, Y at 5.\n\nSo, after this guess, we will know about T, N, Y.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""TANSY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R, I, and E are not in the secret word.\n- A is in the correct position (position 2).\n- S is in the correct position (position 4).\n\nThe secret word must have the form: _ A _ S _, and it cannot contain R, I, or E. For the second guess, I chose ""TANSY"" because:\n- It fits the known pattern (A at position 2, S at position 4).\n- It introduces new common letters (T, N, Y) that haven\'t been tested yet.\n- It avoids the eliminated letters (R, I, E).\n\nThis guess will help test the presence of T, N, and Y, and confirm the positions of A and S.\n\n<guess>TANSY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: TANSY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) N(x) S(✓) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so position 2 is A)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- S: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so position 4 is S)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: TANSY\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, position 2 is A, confirmed again)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- S: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, position 4 is S, confirmed again)\n- Y: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so position 5 is Y)\n\nSo, from the feedback, we now know:\n- The secret word has the second letter A, fourth letter S, and fifth letter Y. So the pattern is: _ A _ S Y\n- We also know that the letters R, I, E, T, N are not in the word.\n\nTherefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter1] A [letter3] S Y\n\nAnd we need to find letter1 and letter3, which cannot be R, I, E, T, N, and also not any other eliminated letters. Currently, eliminated letters are: R, I, E, T, N.\n\nWe have two positions to guess: position 1 and position 3.\n\nWe need to make a third guess. We should choose a word that fits the pattern and uses new letters to test for position 1 and 3.\n\nThe pattern: [1] A [3] S Y\n\nWe know position 1 and 3 must be filled with letters not in the eliminated set.\n\nCommon letters that haven\'t been tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (but note, we have to form a valid word).\n\nWe need to find a word that has the form: [1] A [3] S Y\n\nLet\'s think of possible words:\n\n- DAISY: but D A I S Y -> I is eliminated, so not allowed.\n- HAWKS: H A W K S -> but the last letter is S, not Y, and we need Y at the end. Also, the pattern requires S at position 4 and Y at 5, so HAWKS ends with KS, not SY.\n- We need the word to end with ""SY"".\n\nSo, the last three letters are A (at 2), then S (at 4), and Y (at 5). But note: position 3 is between A and S, so the word has: letter1, then A, then letter3, then S, then Y.\n\nSo the word is: [1]A[3]SY\n\nExamples:\n- DAISY: D A I S Y -> but I is eliminated.\n- PANSY: P A N S Y -> but N is eliminated (from guess 2, N is not in the word).\n- MOSSY: M O S S Y -> but position 2 is O, not A.\n- JAZZY: J A Z Z Y -> but then position 3 is Z, position 4 is Z, not S. We need position 4 to be S.\n\nWe need position 4 to be S, so the word must have S at the fourth position and Y at the fifth.\n\nSo, the third letter (position 3) is before the S, so the word has: [1] A [3] S Y\n\nPossible words:\n- ""HASPY"" - not a common word.\n- ""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> but then position 3 is S, and position 4 is S. So the word is G A S S Y. \n  - This has S at position 3 and S at position 4. But we know position 4 is S, so that\'s fine. However, in this case, position 3 is also S. But we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s or not.\n\nBut in ""GASSY"", the pattern is:\n  Position 1: G\n  Position 2: A\n  Position 3: S\n  Position 4: S\n  Position 5: Y\n\nBut we know position 4 is S, so if we guess GASSY, then:\n- Position 2: A is correct (we know)\n- Position 4: S is correct (we know)\n- Position 5: Y is correct (we know from guess 2)\n\nBut we are testing position 1 (G) and position 3 (S). However, if the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 3 might be marked as absent or wrong position? But we know position 4 has S, so if there is only one S, then the S at position 3 would be extra and might be marked as not present? But actually, in Wordle, if there is only one S and it is at position 4, then the S at position 3 would be marked as absent (x) because the single S is already used at position 4.\n\nBut in our case, we know position 4 is S, so if the secret word has another S, then it might be possible.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid using S at position 3 to not complicate.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words ending with ""SY"" and having A at position 2.\n\nThe only common word I can think of is ""DANDY"" but that doesn\'t have S.\n\nAnother one: ""LASSY"" - but L A S S Y, same as GASSY.\n\nOr ""MASSY"": M A S S Y.\n\nBut these all have S at position 3.\n\nWhat about ""PALSY"": P A L S Y -> \n  Position 1: P\n  Position 2: A\n  Position 3: L\n  Position 4: S\n  Position 5: Y\n\nYes! This fits perfectly: P A L S Y.\n\nAnd L is a new letter, not eliminated.\n\nSimilarly, ""BALSY"" - not a word.\n\n""JALSY"" - not a word.\n\n""WALSY"" - not common.\n\nSo ""PALSY"" is a valid word, meaning a condition.\n\nAnother one: ""HALSY"" - not common.\n\n""GAYLY"" - G A Y L Y -> but position 3 is Y, and position 5 is Y, but we need position 4 to be S, which it\'s not.\n\nSo, ""PALSY"" seems a good candidate.\n\nAnother possibility: ""FANCY"" but no S.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be S, so it must be ...S at the end, but with Y at the end, so ...SY.\n\nSo, the only common words I can think of are those with double S like GASSY, MASSY, or PALSY.\n\nBut PALSY has L at position 3.\n\nAlso, ""DAISY"" is out because of I.\n\nSo, I think ""PALSY"" is a good guess.\n\nWe can also consider ""HASTY"", but H A S T Y -> position 4 is T, not S. We need position 4 to be S.\n\nNo, we know position 4 is S, so we must have S at position 4.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""PALSY"".\n\nIn ""PALSY"":\n- P: new letter\n- A: known correct\n- L: new letter\n- S: known correct\n- Y: known correct\n\nWe are testing P and L.\n\nIf the secret word is ""PALSY"", then we win.\n\nOtherwise, we get feedback on P and L.\n\nBut note: we have only two positions unknown, so we might solve it in this guess or the next.\n\nAnother word: ""JAZZY"" doesn\'t have S.\n\nOr ""BUSKY"" not common.\n\nI think ""PALSY"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let me confirm if there are other options.\n\n""CASKY"" not a word.\n\n""BASSO"" doesn\'t end with Y.\n\nWe know the word ends with Y, because position 5 is Y.\n\nSo, the word must end with SY.\n\nOther words: ""MOSSY"" has O at position 2, not A.\n\n""FUSSY"" has U at position 2.\n\nSo, ""PALSY"" seems the best.\n\nWe could guess a word that doesn\'t have A, S, Y in their positions to test more letters, but that would be inefficient because we know those positions are fixed. It\'s better to use the known positions to focus on the unknown ones.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""PALSY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: A is correct and in position 2, S is correct and in position 4. R, I, and E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (TANSY)**: A (position 2), S (position 4), and Y (position 5) are correct. T and N are absent.\n\nThe secret word must have the pattern: `_ A _ S Y`, with positions 2, 4, and 5 confirmed. Absent letters are R, I, E, T, and N.\n\nFor the third guess, I chose **PALSY** because:\n- It fits the known pattern (A at position 2, S at position 4, Y at position 5).\n- It tests new common letters (P and L) for the unknown positions (1 and 3).\n- It avoids all eliminated letters (R, I, E, T, N).\n\nThis guess will help identify if P or L is in the word and their positions, bringing us closer to solving the puzzle.\n\n<guess>PALSY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: TANSY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) N(x) S(✓) Y(✓)\nGuess 3: PALSY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) L(x) S(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: absent (x)
- A: correct position (✓) at position 2
- I: absent (x)
- S: correct position (✓) at position 4
- E: absent (x)

Guess 2: TANSY
- T: absent (x)
- A: correct position (✓) at position 2
- N: absent (x)
- S: correct position (✓) at position 4
- Y: correct position (✓) at position 5

Guess 3: PALSY
- P: absent (x)
- A: correct position (✓) at position 2
- L: absent (x)
- S: correct position (✓) at position 4
- Y: correct position (✓) at position 5

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ A _ S Y
- Confirmed letters in position: 
  - Position 2: A
  - Position 4: S
  - Position 5: Y
- Absent letters: R, I, E, T, N, P, L

We need to find the first and third letters. The first letter (position 1) and the third letter (position 3) must be letters that are not in the absent list and form a valid English word.

The absent letters so far: R, I, E, T, N, P, L.

Possible letters for position 1 and 3: any letter not in {R, I, E, T, N, P, L}. This includes: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note that Y is already used at the end, and A is at position 2, so they might be repeated? We don't have information about duplicates yet.

However, in the pattern _ A _ S Y, the A and S are fixed, and Y is fixed. The first and third positions are open.

We need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but so far, we haven't encountered any duplicates in the feedback. For example, in PALSY, we had S at position 4, but we don't know if S can appear again. Similarly, A and Y might be duplicated.

But to be safe, we should consider both possibilities.

Now, let's think of words that fit the pattern _ A _ S Y.

Possible words:
- We already tried PALSY, which didn't work because P and L are absent.
- Other possibilities: 
  - DAISY: but I is absent, so invalid.
  - MAISY: M A I S Y -> I is absent, invalid.
  - BAISY: not a word? Or B A I S Y, but I absent.
  - GAWSY: not common, and W might be possible? But let's check.

Actually, common words:
- ""HASPY"" - not a common word.
- ""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> but we have S at position 3 and 4. However, in this case, position 3 is S, which we haven't tested directly. But note, in the pattern, position 3 is the third letter, which in GASSY is S. But we know position 4 is S, so if we guess GASSY, we are testing if there is an S at position 3 as well.

But we have to consider the feedback: if the secret word has only one S (at position 4), then the S at position 3 in GASSY would be marked as absent? Or if it's present but in the wrong position? But since position 4 is already S, and if there is no other S, then the S at position 3 should be absent.

But in our case, we know S is at position 4, so we can have a word with two S's.

Similarly, ""MASSY"": M A S S Y.

But let's list valid words that fit _ A _ S Y and don't use absent letters.

The third letter (position 3) must be a letter not absent, and not conflicting.

Possible candidates:
- ""CASKY"" - not a word.
- ""DASHY"": D A S H Y -> but position 3 is S? No: D A S H Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:A, 3:S, 4:H, 5:Y -> but we need position 4 to be S, so this has H at position 4, not S. So invalid pattern.

We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the third letter and then S at fourth.

So the pattern is: [1] A [3] S Y

So the third letter is at position 3, then S at 4.

So, for example:
- ""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> positions: 1:G, 2:A, 3:S, 4:S, 5:Y -> so position 3 is S, position 4 is S.
- ""MASSY"": M A S S Y -> same.
- ""BASSY"": B A S S Y -> same.

But also:
- ""PASSY"" - not common, but similar.

But we have ""PALSY"" which we tried, with L at position 3.

Another word: ""WASPY"": W A S P Y -> positions: 1:W, 2:A, 3:S, 4:P, 5:Y -> but position 4 is P, not S. So invalid.

We need position 4 to be S, so the word must have S at position 4. Therefore, the letter at position 3 can be anything, but the next is S.

So, the only way to have S at position 4 is if the word has ...AS Y, but with a letter in between.

Actually, the word is: letter1, A, letter3, S, Y.

So, for ""GASSY"": letter3 is S, so it's A followed by S (at position 3), then S again at 4? No:

In ""GASSY"":
- Position 1: G
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: Y

So, position 3 is S, position 4 is S. So the pattern is satisfied because position 4 is S.

Similarly, in ""PALSY"", position 3 is L, position 4 is S.

Now, we have eliminated P and L for position 1 and 3 in the last guess.

So, for position 1, we cannot use P, and for position 3, we cannot use L.

Also, we cannot use R,I,E,T,N.

So, what are possible words?

- ""GASSY"": G at position 1, S at position 3. But we haven't tested G or the double S.
- ""BASSY"": B at 1, S at 3.
- ""MASSY"": M at 1, S at 3.
- ""CASSY"": C at 1, S at 3. But ""CASSY"" might be a name, but let's consider if it's valid.
- ""DASSY"": not common.
- ""FASSY"": not common.
- ""HASSY"": not common.
- ""JASSY"": not common.
- ""KASSY"": not common.
- ""SASSY"": S A S S Y -> but position 1 is S, and we have S at position 4. But we don't know if S can be at position 1. Also, we have not tested S at position 1.

""SASSY"": 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: Y

This has three S's. But we know position 4 is S, so it's possible.

But we haven't tested S at position 1 or 3.

Now, we need to choose a guess that tests new letters.

But we have only two positions to guess, and we can try a word that uses new letters for position 1 and 3.

Possible new letters for position 1: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (avoiding R,I,E,T,N,P,L)

For position 3: same, but note that if we use a word with S at position 3, that might be efficient if we think there is a double S.

But we don't have evidence of double S yet.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use S at position 3 to test a different letter.

For example, what other letters can be at position 3?

In ""PALSY"" we tried L, which was absent. So position 3 cannot be L.

What about other letters? For example, ""DAISY"" is out because of I.

""MAYBE"" doesn't have S.

Another word: ""HABIT"" doesn't fit.

Let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and use allowed letters.

Possible words:
- With no double S: 
  - ""WASPY"" - but position 4 is P, not S. No.
  - ""JAZZY"" - no S.
  - ""FAWNY"" - no S.
  - ""CABBY"" - no S.

I think the only common words with the pattern _ A _ S Y are those with double S or PALSY (which we tried).

But PALSY didn't work.

So, perhaps the word has double S.

Let me think: ""GASSY"", ""BASSY"", ""SASSY"", ""MASSY"", etc.

We can try ""GASSY"" to test.

But we have to make a guess.

Another possibility: ""DASHY"" is D A S H Y, but that has S at position 3 and H at 4, not S at 4. So it doesn't fit the pattern.

We need position 4 to be S, so the only way is to have the third letter and then S, so if the third letter is not S, then the word must have a letter at 3 and then S at 4.

For example, ""PALSY"" has L at 3 and S at 4.

Similarly, what about ""BALSY""? Not a word.

""FALSY"" - not common, but in programming, but might not be in word list.

""JASPY"" - not common.

I think we are left with the double S words.

So, let's try ""GASSY"".

In ""GASSY"", we have:
- G at position 1: new letter
- A at 2: known
- S at 3: we are testing if S is present and if it can be at position 3
- S at 4: known
- Y at 5: known

If the secret word is ""GASSY"", we win.

If not, we might get feedback that G is absent or the S at position 3 is not correct (if there is no second S).

But if the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 3 in GASSY would be marked as absent, even though S is in the word, because the only S is at position 4 and is already used.

So, the feedback would show:
- G: ? 
- A: ✓
- S: might be x (if no second S) or ✓ (if there is second S at position 3)
- S: ✓ (because position 4 is S)
- Y: ✓

But the first S (position 3) would be marked as absent if there is no second S.

Alternatively, if the word is ""SASSY"", then position 1 is S, which we haven't tested.

But we don't know if S can be at position 1.

To be systematic, let's choose a word that uses a new letter for position 1 and a new letter for position 3, but if we avoid S at position 3, what are the options?

For example, is there a word like ""BABY"" but 5 letters? No.

""JAGSY"" not a word.

""QUASY"" not a word.

I think the only practical choices are the double S words or perhaps we missed a word.

Another word: ""HASTY"" but position 4 is T, not S.

""PASTY"" same.

""NASTY"" same.

""TASTY"" same.

""RASPY"" has R, which is absent.

""GASPY"" not common.

""WASHY"" W A S H Y -> position 4 is H, not S.

So, I think we have to go with a double S word.

Let's choose ""SASSY"" because it also tests S at position 1.

But position 1 is S, which we haven't tested as absent, but we know S is in the word at position 4, so it could be at position 1 as well.

So, ""SASSY"" has S at position 1, A at 2, S at 3, S at 4, Y at 5.

If we guess ""SASSY"", and the secret word is ""GASSY"", then:
- Position 1: S vs G, so S would be marked as absent? But S is in the word at position 4, so if there is only one S, then S at position 1 and 3 would be marked as absent or wrong position? 

This might be messy.

Perhaps ""GASSY"" is a safer guess because it uses a new letter G.

Let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and allowed letters:

- GASSY: G at 1, S at 3
- BASSY: B at 1, S at 3
- CASSY: C at 1, S at 3 (CASSY is a name, but might be accepted)
- MASSY: M at 1, S at 3
- SASSY: S at 1, S at 3
- etc.

We can try ""BASIS"" but doesn't end with Y.

Given that, I'll go with ""GASSY"" as the next guess.

But we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that tests two new letters without S at position 3.

For example, is there a word like ""DADDY"" but no S.

Or ""FADDY"" not a word.

""JUDGY"" not.

I think it's hard, so I'll go with ""GASSY"".

So, guess: GASSY

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If the secret word is ""GASSY"", we win.

If not, and if G is absent, then we know position 1 is not G, and the S at position 3 might be absent (if no second S), then we know position 3 is not S, and we can try other letters.

But if position 3 is not S, then what other letter can it be? We have no other common words.

Unless we missed a word.

Another word: ""DALLY"" but no S.

""GALLY"" not.

""PALLY"" has P and L, which are absent.

I think we have to try.

Perhaps ""HAPPY"" but no S.

I think ""GASSY"" is the best bet.

So, I'll go with that.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: 
     - R (absent), A (correct position 2), I (absent), S (correct position 4), E (absent).
   - **Guess 2 (TANSY)**:
     - T (absent), A (correct position 2), N (absent), S (correct position 4), Y (correct position 5).
   - **Guess 3 (PALSY)**:
     - P (absent), A (correct position 2), L (absent), S (correct position 4), Y (correct position 5).

2. **Deductions from Feedback**:
   - The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ A _ S Y` (positions: 2=A, 4=S, 5=Y).
   - Confirmed absent letters: **R, I, E, T, N, P, L** (from all guesses).
   - Unknown positions: **1 and 3** need to be filled with letters not in the absent list.
   - Possible letters for positions 1 and 3: Any letter not in {R, I, E, T, N, P, L}, such as B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. Note that A, S, and Y are confirmed but could potentially repeat (though no evidence yet).

3. **Evaluate Possible Words**:
   - The pattern `_ A _ S Y` limits options. Common words fitting this pattern include:
     - **GASSY**: G at position 1, S at position 3.
     - **BASSY**: B at position 1, S at position 3.
     - **MASSY**: M at position 1, S at position 3.
     - **SASSY**: S at position 1, S at position 3.
   - Words like DAISY or PALSY are invalid (contain absent letters I or L/P).
   - Since position 3 could be S (allowing double S), testing a word with S at position 3 is efficient. It tests if a second S exists and uses new letters for position 1.
   - **Why choose GASSY?** 
     - It tests a new letter (G) for position 1 and S for position 3.
     - If G is correct, we solve position 1. If not, we eliminate G.
     - The S at position 3 tests for a potential double S (if present, it confirms; if absent, it rules out S for position 3).
     - GASSY is a valid English word (meaning ""resembling or full of gas""), avoiding absent letters.

4. **Strategy**:
   - With only positions 1 and 3 unknown, GASSY maximizes information by testing a new consonant (G) and the double-S possibility.
   - If GASSY is incorrect, feedback on G and the position 3 S will narrow options further (e.g., if S at position 3 is absent, we eliminate double S and focus on other letters for position 3 like B, M, etc.).

<guess>GASSY</guess>",GASSY,"We have the following feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: absent (x)
- A: correct position (✓) at position 2
- I: absent (x)
- S: correct position (✓) at position 4
- E: absent (x)

Guess 2: TANSY
- T: absent (x)
- A: correct position (✓) at position 2
- N: absent (x)
- S: correct position (✓) at position 4
- Y: correct position (✓) at position 5

Guess 3: PALSY
- P: absent (x)
- A: correct position (✓) at position 2
- L: absent (x)
- S: correct position (✓) at position 4
- Y: correct position (✓) at position 5

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ A _ S Y
- Confirmed letters in position: 
  - Position 2: A
  - Position 4: S
  - Position 5: Y
- Absent letters: R, I, E, T, N, P, L

We need to find the first and third letters. The first letter (position 1) and the third letter (position 3) must be letters that are not in the absent list and form a valid English word.

The absent letters so far: R, I, E, T, N, P, L.

Possible letters for position 1 and 3: any letter not in {R, I, E, T, N, P, L}. This includes: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note that Y is already used at the end, and A is at position 2, so they might be repeated? We don't have information about duplicates yet.

However, in the pattern _ A _ S Y, the A and S are fixed, and Y is fixed. The first and third positions are open.

We need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but so far, we haven't encountered any duplicates in the feedback. For example, in PALSY, we had S at position 4, but we don't know if S can appear again. Similarly, A and Y might be duplicated.

But to be safe, we should consider both possibilities.

Now, let's think of words that fit the pattern _ A _ S Y.

Possible words:
- We already tried PALSY, which didn't work because P and L are absent.
- Other possibilities: 
  - DAISY: but I is absent, so invalid.
  - MAISY: M A I S Y -> I is absent, invalid.
  - BAISY: not a word? Or B A I S Y, but I absent.
  - GAWSY: not common, and W might be possible? But let's check.

Actually, common words:
- ""HASPY"" - not a common word.
- ""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> but we have S at position 3 and 4. However, in this case, position 3 is S, which we haven't tested directly. But note, in the pattern, position 3 is the third letter, which in GASSY is S. But we know position 4 is S, so if we guess GASSY, we are testing if there is an S at position 3 as well.

But we have to consider the feedback: if the secret word has only one S (at position 4), then the S at position 3 in GASSY would be marked as absent? Or if it's present but in the wrong position? But since position 4 is already S, and if there is no other S, then the S at position 3 should be absent.

But in our case, we know S is at position 4, so we can have a word with two S's.

Similarly, ""MASSY"": M A S S Y.

But let's list valid words that fit _ A _ S Y and don't use absent letters.

The third letter (position 3) must be a letter not absent, and not conflicting.

Possible candidates:
- ""CASKY"" - not a word.
- ""DASHY"": D A S H Y -> but position 3 is S? No: D A S H Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:A, 3:S, 4:H, 5:Y -> but we need position 4 to be S, so this has H at position 4, not S. So invalid pattern.

We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the third letter and then S at fourth.

So the pattern is: [1] A [3] S Y

So the third letter is at position 3, then S at 4.

So, for example:
- ""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> positions: 1:G, 2:A, 3:S, 4:S, 5:Y -> so position 3 is S, position 4 is S.
- ""MASSY"": M A S S Y -> same.
- ""BASSY"": B A S S Y -> same.

But also:
- ""PASSY"" - not common, but similar.

But we have ""PALSY"" which we tried, with L at position 3.

Another word: ""WASPY"": W A S P Y -> positions: 1:W, 2:A, 3:S, 4:P, 5:Y -> but position 4 is P, not S. So invalid.

We need position 4 to be S, so the word must have S at position 4. Therefore, the letter at position 3 can be anything, but the next is S.

So, the only way to have S at position 4 is if the word has ...AS Y, but with a letter in between.

Actually, the word is: letter1, A, letter3, S, Y.

So, for ""GASSY"": letter3 is S, so it's A followed by S (at position 3), then S again at 4? No:

In ""GASSY"":
- Position 1: G
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: Y

So, position 3 is S, position 4 is S. So the pattern is satisfied because position 4 is S.

Similarly, in ""PALSY"", position 3 is L, position 4 is S.

Now, we have eliminated P and L for position 1 and 3 in the last guess.

So, for position 1, we cannot use P, and for position 3, we cannot use L.

Also, we cannot use R,I,E,T,N.

So, what are possible words?

- ""GASSY"": G at position 1, S at position 3. But we haven't tested G or the double S.
- ""BASSY"": B at 1, S at 3.
- ""MASSY"": M at 1, S at 3.
- ""CASSY"": C at 1, S at 3. But ""CASSY"" might be a name, but let's consider if it's valid.
- ""DASSY"": not common.
- ""FASSY"": not common.
- ""HASSY"": not common.
- ""JASSY"": not common.
- ""KASSY"": not common.
- ""SASSY"": S A S S Y -> but position 1 is S, and we have S at position 4. But we don't know if S can be at position 1. Also, we have not tested S at position 1.

""SASSY"": 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: Y

This has three S's. But we know position 4 is S, so it's possible.

But we haven't tested S at position 1 or 3.

Now, we need to choose a guess that tests new letters.

But we have only two positions to guess, and we can try a word that uses new letters for position 1 and 3.

Possible new letters for position 1: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (avoiding R,I,E,T,N,P,L)

For position 3: same, but note that if we use a word with S at position 3, that might be efficient if we think there is a double S.

But we don't have evidence of double S yet.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use S at position 3 to test a different letter.

For example, what other letters can be at position 3?

In ""PALSY"" we tried L, which was absent. So position 3 cannot be L.

What about other letters? For example, ""DAISY"" is out because of I.

""MAYBE"" doesn't have S.

Another word: ""HABIT"" doesn't fit.

Let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and use allowed letters.

Possible words:
- With no double S: 
  - ""WASPY"" - but position 4 is P, not S. No.
  - ""JAZZY"" - no S.
  - ""FAWNY"" - no S.
  - ""CABBY"" - no S.

I think the only common words with the pattern _ A _ S Y are those with double S or PALSY (which we tried).

But PALSY didn't work.

So, perhaps the word has double S.

Let me think: ""GASSY"", ""BASSY"", ""SASSY"", ""MASSY"", etc.

We can try ""GASSY"" to test.

But we have to make a guess.

Another possibility: ""DASHY"" is D A S H Y, but that has S at position 3 and H at 4, not S at 4. So it doesn't fit the pattern.

We need position 4 to be S, so the only way is to have the third letter and then S, so if the third letter is not S, then the word must have a letter at 3 and then S at 4.

For example, ""PALSY"" has L at 3 and S at 4.

Similarly, what about ""BALSY""? Not a word.

""FALSY"" - not common, but in programming, but might not be in word list.

""JASPY"" - not common.

I think we are left with the double S words.

So, let's try ""GASSY"".

In ""GASSY"", we have:
- G at position 1: new letter
- A at 2: known
- S at 3: we are testing if S is present and if it can be at position 3
- S at 4: known
- Y at 5: known

If the secret word is ""GASSY"", we win.

If not, we might get feedback that G is absent or the S at position 3 is not correct (if there is no second S).

But if the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 3 in GASSY would be marked as absent, even though S is in the word, because the only S is at position 4 and is already used.

So, the feedback would show:
- G: ? 
- A: ✓
- S: might be x (if no second S) or ✓ (if there is second S at position 3)
- S: ✓ (because position 4 is S)
- Y: ✓

But the first S (position 3) would be marked as absent if there is no second S.

Alternatively, if the word is ""SASSY"", then position 1 is S, which we haven't tested.

But we don't know if S can be at position 1.

To be systematic, let's choose a word that uses a new letter for position 1 and a new letter for position 3, but if we avoid S at position 3, what are the options?

For example, is there a word like ""BABY"" but 5 letters? No.

""JAGSY"" not a word.

""QUASY"" not a word.

I think the only practical choices are the double S words or perhaps we missed a word.

Another word: ""HASTY"" but position 4 is T, not S.

""PASTY"" same.

""NASTY"" same.

""TASTY"" same.

""RASPY"" has R, which is absent.

""GASPY"" not common.

""WASHY"" W A S H Y -> position 4 is H, not S.

So, I think we have to go with a double S word.

Let's choose ""SASSY"" because it also tests S at position 1.

But position 1 is S, which we haven't tested as absent, but we know S is in the word at position 4, so it could be at position 1 as well.

So, ""SASSY"" has S at position 1, A at 2, S at 3, S at 4, Y at 5.

If we guess ""SASSY"", and the secret word is ""GASSY"", then:
- Position 1: S vs G, so S would be marked as absent? But S is in the word at position 4, so if there is only one S, then S at position 1 and 3 would be marked as absent or wrong position? 

This might be messy.

Perhaps ""GASSY"" is a safer guess because it uses a new letter G.

Let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and allowed letters:

- GASSY: G at 1, S at 3
- BASSY: B at 1, S at 3
- CASSY: C at 1, S at 3 (CASSY is a name, but might be accepted)
- MASSY: M at 1, S at 3
- SASSY: S at 1, S at 3
- etc.

We can try ""BASIS"" but doesn't end with Y.

Given that, I'll go with ""GASSY"" as the next guess.

But we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that tests two new letters without S at position 3.

For example, is there a word like ""DADDY"" but no S.

Or ""FADDY"" not a word.

""JUDGY"" not.

I think it's hard, so I'll go with ""GASSY"".

So, guess: GASSY

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If the secret word is ""GASSY"", we win.

If not, and if G is absent, then we know position 1 is not G, and the S at position 3 might be absent (if no second S), then we know position 3 is not S, and we can try other letters.

But if position 3 is not S, then what other letter can it be? We have no other common words.

Unless we missed a word.

Another word: ""DALLY"" but no S.

""GALLY"" not.

""PALLY"" has P and L, which are absent.

I think we have to try.

Perhaps ""HAPPY"" but no S.

I think ""GASSY"" is the best bet.

So, I'll go with that.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: 
     - R (absent), A (correct position 2), I (absent), S (correct position 4), E (absent).
   - **Guess 2 (TANSY)**:
     - T (absent), A (correct position 2), N (absent), S (correct position 4), Y (correct position 5).
   - **Guess 3 (PALSY)**:
     - P (absent), A (correct position 2), L (absent), S (correct position 4), Y (correct position 5).

2. **Deductions from Feedback**:
   - The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ A _ S Y` (positions: 2=A, 4=S, 5=Y).
   - Confirmed absent letters: **R, I, E, T, N, P, L** (from all guesses).
   - Unknown positions: **1 and 3** need to be filled with letters not in the absent list.
   - Possible letters for positions 1 and 3: Any letter not in {R, I, E, T, N, P, L}, such as B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. Note that A, S, and Y are confirmed but could potentially repeat (though no evidence yet).

3. **Evaluate Possible Words**:
   - The pattern `_ A _ S Y` limits options. Common words fitting this pattern include:
     - **GASSY**: G at position 1, S at position 3.
     - **BASSY**: B at position 1, S at position 3.
     - **MASSY**: M at position 1, S at position 3.
     - **SASSY**: S at position 1, S at position 3.
   - Words like DAISY or PALSY are invalid (contain absent letters I or L/P).
   - Since position 3 could be S (allowing double S), testing a word with S at position 3 is efficient. It tests if a second S exists and uses new letters for position 1.
   - **Why choose GASSY?** 
     - It tests a new letter (G) for position 1 and S for position 3.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 However, note that the example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we can choose any valid 5-letter word.

 Let me choose a word that has a set of common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 But note: the example secret word was ""BRISK"", so let's not base our choice on that.

 Alternatively, I can choose ""ROAST"" or ""SLATE"". However, I recall that ""RAISE"" is also a good starting word because it has three vowels and common consonants.

 Since we are at the first guess, any of these are acceptable.

 I'll choose: ""RAISE""

 Why?
 - It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
 - It covers a good set of letters.

 So, my first guess is ""RAISE"".I am starting the game and need to make my first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a word with common letters to maximize information. A good starting word typically includes frequent vowels and consonants. I'll use ""RAISE"" because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), covering a broad range of possibilities. This should help narrow down the secret word effectively.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so the second letter of the secret word is A)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so the fourth letter of the secret word is S)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter is A (position 2).
- The fourth letter is S (position 4).
- The letters R, I, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ A _ S _

We also know that the word does not contain R, I, E.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should try to use a word that:
- Has the second letter as A and the fourth letter as S (to confirm or get more information, but note we already know these are fixed, so we can use them to test other positions).
- Includes other common letters that haven't been tried yet (avoiding R, I, E).

Common letters we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to form a word that fits the pattern _ A _ S _ and uses new letters.

But note: our guess doesn't have to have A in the second and S in the fourth? Actually, we can, but we might also choose to test other positions. However, since we know A and S are in those positions, we can use them to help us find the other letters.

Let me think of words that have the form _ A _ S _ and do not contain R, I, E.

Some possibilities:
- TANS: but that's 4 letters, we need 5. So, TANSY? Not common. 
- We need 5-letter words.

Common words:
- TASKS: T A S K S -> but the fourth letter is K, not S? Wait, let's break down: 
  Position: 1: T, 2: A, 3: S, 4: K, 5: S -> that doesn't fit because we need S at the fourth position, but here the fourth is K and fifth is S. Also, we have S at the third and fifth, but we know the fourth is S, so that might be acceptable? Actually, the pattern is _ A _ S _, so:
  Position 1: any
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: any
  Position 4: S
  Position 5: any

So, TASKS: 
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: A -> good
- Position 3: S -> but we don't know about position 3, so that's okay
- Position 4: K -> but we need S at position 4? Wait, no: in TASKS, the fourth letter is K (if we count: 1:T, 2:A, 3:S, 4:K, 5:S). So the fourth letter is K, not S. So that doesn't match.

We need a word where the fourth letter is S. So the pattern is: 
Letter1: ?, Letter2: A, Letter3: ?, Letter4: S, Letter5: ?

Examples:
- CLASS: C L A S S -> but that's A at position 3, not 2. So no.
- PASTA: P A S T A -> but then position 3 is S, but we need position 4 to be S? 
  Let's break: 
  P (1), A (2), S (3), T (4), A (5) -> so position 4 is T, not S.

We need the fourth letter to be S. So:

- GAWKS: G A W K S -> position 4 is K, not S.
- BASTS: B A S T S -> position 4 is T? 
  B(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), S(5) -> position 4 is T.

I think I'm having trouble. Let me think of words ending with S? But we need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the fourth letter as S, meaning the last two letters are the fifth and the fourth is S? Not necessarily, because the fifth can be anything.

Actually, the word must have the structure: 
[letter1] A [letter3] S [letter5]

So, for example:
- MASTS: M A S T S -> 
  M(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), S(5) -> but position 4 is T, not S. We need position 4 to be S? 
  Wait, no: in MASTS, the letters are: 
  Position 1: M
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: S
  Position 4: T
  Position 5: S

That doesn't have S at position 4.

We need the fourth letter to be S. So the word must have the fourth character as S. 

For example:
- The word ""PASS"" is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

Let me think of 5-letter words with S at the fourth position and A at the second.

Examples:
- CAUSE: C A U S E -> 
  C(1), A(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E is already eliminated (from first feedback: E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.

- FEAST: F E A S T -> 
  F(1), E(2), A(3), S(4), T(5) -> but position 2 is E, not A. We need A at position 2.

We need A at position 2 and S at position 4.

So:
- Letter1: ?
- Letter2: A
- Letter3: ?
- Letter4: S
- Letter5: ?

And the word must not contain R, I, E.

Possible words:
- HASTY: H A S T Y -> 
  H(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but position 4 is T, not S. We need position 4 to be S, so the third letter is free, but the fourth must be S.

In HASTY, the fourth letter is T, not S.

I think I'm making a mistake. Let me clarify: the fourth letter must be S, so in the word, the character at index 3 (if we start counting at 0) or index 4? 

In the feedback, we count positions starting from 1.

For the word ""RAISE"":
- R is position 1
- A is position 2
- I is position 3
- S is position 4
- E is position 5

So, the feedback said A is correct at position 2 and S is correct at position 4.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 1: unknown, but not R (since R is not in the word)
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: unknown, but not I (since I is not in the word)
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: unknown, but not E

So the pattern is: [not R, not I, not E] A [not R, not I, not E] S [not R, not I, not E]

Now, we need to find a word that fits: _ A _ S _

And we must avoid the letters R, I, E.

Let me list some words that fit this pattern:

- TALKS: T A L K S -> 
  Position 1: T, 2: A, 3: L, 4: K, 5: S -> but position 4 is K, not S. We need position 4 to be S.

- We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the fourth character as S.

Examples of words with second letter A and fourth letter S:

- GAZES: but has E and Z? And E is eliminated.
- JAZZY: J A Z Z Y -> position 4 is Z, not S.
- I'm struggling. Let me think of common words.

Another idea: ""BASIS"" -> B A S I S -> 
  B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5) -> but position 4 is I, not S. And I is eliminated.

""CASKS"": C A S K S -> 
  C(1), A(2), S(3), K(4), S(5) -> position 4 is K.

""PASSE"": P A S S E -> 
  P(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E is eliminated.

""MASSE"": same issue with E.

""WASPS"": W A S P S -> 
  W(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), S(5) -> position 4 is P.

I need to look for words where the fourth letter is S. That means the word has the structure: ??A?S? but with the fourth letter being the fourth character.

Actually, the fourth character is the one at index 3 (if we index from 0). So in a 5-letter word, the positions are:
Index 0: first letter
Index 1: second letter
Index 2: third letter
Index 3: fourth letter
Index 4: fifth letter

We need:
Index 1: A
Index 3: S

So, the word: [0] A [2] S [4]

And [0], [2], [4] cannot be R, I, E, and also not the letters we know are absent.

Now, let me think of words:

- ""HASTE"": H A S T E -> 
  [0]:H, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> but [3] is T, not S. And we need [3] to be S.

I think I found one: ""CAUSE"" has [3] as S? 
C A U S E: 
[0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:U, [3]:S, [4]:E -> yes, but [4] is E which is eliminated.

- ""PAUSE"": same issue.

- ""TASTE"": T A S T E -> 
  [0]:T, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> [3] is T, not S.

- ""BASTE"": same as TASTE.

- ""PASTE"": P A S T E -> 
  [0]:P, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> [3] is T.

I need to find a word where the fourth letter (index 3) is S.

For example:
- ""GASPS"": G A S P S -> 
  [0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:P, [4]:S -> [3] is P.

- ""CLASS"": C L A S S -> 
  [0]:C, [1]:L, [2]:A, [3]:S, [4]:S -> but [1] is L, not A. We need [1] to be A.

We need [1] to be A and [3] to be S.

So, the word must have:
- The second letter (index 1) is A.
- The fourth letter (index 3) is S.

So, the structure: 
Letter0: ?
Letter1: A
Letter2: ?
Letter3: S
Letter4: ?

And the word must not contain R, I, E.

Let me search my vocabulary:

- ""DAISY"": D A I S Y -> 
  [0]:D, [1]:A, [2]:I, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> but I is eliminated (from first feedback: I is not in the word). So we cannot use I.

- ""HASTY"": H A S T Y -> 
  [0]:H, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:Y -> [3] is T, not S.

- ""NASTY"": N A S T Y -> same, [3] is T.

- ""PASTY"": P A S T Y -> same.

- ""TANSY"": T A N S Y -> 
  [0]:T, [1]:A, [2]:N, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> yes! [3] is S.

So, ""TANSY"" is a word? It means a type of plant. But is it common? In Wordle, the word list might include it.

But let's check the letters: T, A, N, S, Y. 
- T: not eliminated
- A: we know is in
- N: new
- S: we know is in
- Y: new

And it doesn't contain R, I, E.

So, ""TANSY"" fits the pattern and uses new letters.

Another word: ""MANGO"" doesn't have S at position 4.

""BASSO"" is not common.

""CASAS"": C A S A S -> 
  [0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:A, [4]:S -> [3] is A, not S.

""LASSI"": L A S S I -> 
  [0]:L, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:I -> [3] is S, but [4] is I which is eliminated.

""PASHA"": P A S H A -> 
  [0]:P, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:H, [4]:A -> [3] is H.

I think ""TANSY"" is a candidate.

Another one: ""JASPS"" is not common.

Or ""VASAL"", but [3] is A.

Perhaps ""TAWSE"", but has E.

I think ""TANSY"" is acceptable.

But note: we are allowed to guess any valid 5-letter word, not necessarily one that fits the known positions. However, it's efficient to use the known positions to test other letters.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that doesn't have A in position 2 and S in position 4, but that would waste the known information. It's better to use them to get more information about the other positions.

So, I'll go with ""TANSY"".

But let me confirm: TANSY is a valid word? Yes, it's in the dictionary.

So, guess: TANSY

We hope to get feedback that tells us about T, N, Y and also confirms A and S (which we already know).

But note: we know A and S are in the word, but in TANSY, A is at position 2 and S is at position 4, which are the correct positions? We know they are correct, so we expect them to be marked as correct.

However, the feedback might show:
- T: ? 
- A: should be ✓
- N: ?
- S: should be ✓
- Y: ?

But the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but in this case, TANSY has unique letters.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that has different letters to test more.

But with the constraints, TANSY is a good choice.

Another common word: ""PASTA"" doesn't fit because [3] is T.

Or ""MASTA"" not a word.

I think TANSY is fine.

But let me think of a more common word: ""HASTY"" doesn't have S at [3].

What about ""BASES"": B A S E S -> 
  [0]:B, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:E, [4]:S -> [3] is E, eliminated.

""CASES"": same.

""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> 
  [0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> [3] is S! Yes.

So, ""GASSY"" is a word. It means containing gas or gaseous.

Letters: G, A, S, S, Y. 
- G: new
- A: known
- S: known (but we have two S's)
- Y: new

But note: the feedback for the first guess said S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4). It didn't say anything about multiple S's. So there could be multiple S's.

In ""GASSY"", we have S at position 2 and 3? 
[0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:Y

So position 4 is [3] which is S, so that matches. And position 2 is A, which matches.

But we have an extra S at position 2? [2] is S.

The secret word might have an S at position 3? We don't know.

But in our first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was correct. We didn't have S at position 3 in the first guess (we had I at position 3). So we don't know about position 3.

So ""GASSY"" is also a candidate.

But ""GASSY"" has two S's. It might be a good test because if the secret word has only one S, then one of the S's in GASSY might be marked as wrong position or not present? But we know position 4 must be S, so the S at position 3 in GASSY might be additional.

But to avoid complexity, maybe a word with unique letters is better. TANSY has unique letters.

However, TANSY is less common. Let me see if there's a more common word.

Another word: ""PAYSA"" not a word.

""TASSA"" not common.

""CANST"": C A N S T -> 
  [0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:N, [3]:S, [4]:T -> yes! [3] is S.

""CANST"" is an archaic word for can or container, but might be in the word list.

""HASTY"" doesn't work.

""NASTY"" doesn't work.

""PASTY"" doesn't work.

""RASTA"" has R, which is eliminated.

I think ""TANSY"" or ""GASSY"" or ""CANST"" are options.

But ""GASSY"" is in the Wordle word list, I believe.

To maximize new letters, TANSY has T, N, Y which are new.

GASSY has G and Y, but S is repeated.

Since we have limited guesses, I'd prefer to test more new letters.

So, I'll go with ""TANSY"".

But let me check: in the first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was correct. In TANSY, we are putting S at position 4 again, which is safe because we know it's correct. And A at position 2 is also correct.

The new letters are T at 1, N at 3, Y at 5.

So, after this guess, we will know about T, N, Y.

Therefore, I choose ""TANSY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, I, and E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the correct position (position 2).
- S is in the correct position (position 4).

The secret word must have the form: _ A _ S _, and it cannot contain R, I, or E. For the second guess, I chose ""TANSY"" because:
- It fits the known pattern (A at position 2, S at position 4).
- It introduces new common letters (T, N, Y) that haven't been tested yet.
- It avoids the eliminated letters (R, I, E).

This guess will help test the presence of T, N, and Y, and confirm the positions of A and S.

<guess>TANSY</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: TANSY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) N(x) S(✓) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so position 2 is A)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so position 4 is S)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: TANSY
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, position 2 is A, confirmed again)
- N: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, position 4 is S, confirmed again)
- Y: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so position 5 is Y)

So, from the feedback, we now know:
- The secret word has the second letter A, fourth letter S, and fifth letter Y. So the pattern is: _ A _ S Y
- We also know that the letters R, I, E, T, N are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter1] A [letter3] S Y

And we need to find letter1 and letter3, which cannot be R, I, E, T, N, and also not any other eliminated letters. Currently, eliminated letters are: R, I, E, T, N.

We have two positions to guess: position 1 and position 3.

We need to make a third guess. We should choose a word that fits the pattern and uses new letters to test for position 1 and 3.

The pattern: [1] A [3] S Y

We know position 1 and 3 must be filled with letters not in the eliminated set.

Common letters that haven't been tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (but note, we have to form a valid word).

We need to find a word that has the form: [1] A [3] S Y

Let's think of possible words:

- DAISY: but D A I S Y -> I is eliminated, so not allowed.
- HAWKS: H A W K S -> but the last letter is S, not Y, and we need Y at the end. Also, the pattern requires S at position 4 and Y at 5, so HAWKS ends with KS, not SY.
- We need the word to end with ""SY"".

So, the last three letters are A (at 2), then S (at 4), and Y (at 5). But note: position 3 is between A and S, so the word has: letter1, then A, then letter3, then S, then Y.

So the word is: [1]A[3]SY

Examples:
- DAISY: D A I S Y -> but I is eliminated.
- PANSY: P A N S Y -> but N is eliminated (from guess 2, N is not in the word).
- MOSSY: M O S S Y -> but position 2 is O, not A.
- JAZZY: J A Z Z Y -> but then position 3 is Z, position 4 is Z, not S. We need position 4 to be S.

We need position 4 to be S, so the word must have S at the fourth position and Y at the fifth.

So, the third letter (position 3) is before the S, so the word has: [1] A [3] S Y

Possible words:
- ""HASPY"" - not a common word.
- ""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> but then position 3 is S, and position 4 is S. So the word is G A S S Y. 
  - This has S at position 3 and S at position 4. But we know position 4 is S, so that's fine. However, in this case, position 3 is also S. But we don't know if the word has two S's or not.

But in ""GASSY"", the pattern is:
  Position 1: G
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: S
  Position 4: S
  Position 5: Y

But we know position 4 is S, so if we guess GASSY, then:
- Position 2: A is correct (we know)
- Position 4: S is correct (we know)
- Position 5: Y is correct (we know from guess 2)

But we are testing position 1 (G) and position 3 (S). However, if the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 3 might be marked as absent or wrong position? But we know position 4 has S, so if there is only one S, then the S at position 3 would be extra and might be marked as not present? But actually, in Wordle, if there is only one S and it is at position 4, then the S at position 3 would be marked as absent (x) because the single S is already used at position 4.

But in our case, we know position 4 is S, so if the secret word has another S, then it might be possible.

Alternatively, we can avoid using S at position 3 to not complicate.

But let's list possible words ending with ""SY"" and having A at position 2.

The only common word I can think of is ""DANDY"" but that doesn't have S.

Another one: ""LASSY"" - but L A S S Y, same as GASSY.

Or ""MASSY"": M A S S Y.

But these all have S at position 3.

What about ""PALSY"": P A L S Y -> 
  Position 1: P
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: L
  Position 4: S
  Position 5: Y

Yes! This fits perfectly: P A L S Y.

And L is a new letter, not eliminated.

Similarly, ""BALSY"" - not a word.

""JALSY"" - not a word.

""WALSY"" - not common.

So ""PALSY"" is a valid word, meaning a condition.

Another one: ""HALSY"" - not common.

""GAYLY"" - G A Y L Y -> but position 3 is Y, and position 5 is Y, but we need position 4 to be S, which it's not.

So, ""PALSY"" seems a good candidate.

Another possibility: ""FANCY"" but no S.

We need the fourth letter to be S, so it must be ...S at the end, but with Y at the end, so ...SY.

So, the only common words I can think of are those with double S like GASSY, MASSY, or PALSY.

But PALSY has L at position 3.

Also, ""DAISY"" is out because of I.

So, I think ""PALSY"" is a good guess.

We can also consider ""HASTY"", but H A S T Y -> position 4 is T, not S. We need position 4 to be S.

No, we know position 4 is S, so we must have S at position 4.

So, let's go with ""PALSY"".

In ""PALSY"":
- P: new letter
- A: known correct
- L: new letter
- S: known correct
- Y: known correct

We are testing P and L.

If the secret word is ""PALSY"", then we win.

Otherwise, we get feedback on P and L.

But note: we have only two positions unknown, so we might solve it in this guess or the next.

Another word: ""JAZZY"" doesn't have S.

Or ""BUSKY"" not common.

I think ""PALSY"" is acceptable.

But let me confirm if there are other options.

""CASKY"" not a word.

""BASSO"" doesn't end with Y.

We know the word ends with Y, because position 5 is Y.

So, the word must end with SY.

Other words: ""MOSSY"" has O at position 2, not A.

""FUSSY"" has U at position 2.

So, ""PALSY"" seems the best.

We could guess a word that doesn't have A, S, Y in their positions to test more letters, but that would be inefficient because we know those positions are fixed. It's better to use the known positions to focus on the unknown ones.

So, I'll go with ""PALSY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: A is correct and in position 2, S is correct and in position 4. R, I, and E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (TANSY)**: A (position 2), S (position 4), and Y (position 5) are correct. T and N are absent.

The secret word must have the pattern: `_ A _ S Y`, with positions 2, 4, and 5 confirmed. Absent letters are R, I, E, T, and N.

For the third guess, I chose **PALSY** because:
- It fits the known pattern (A at position 2, S at position 4, Y at position 5).
- It tests new common letters (P and L) for the unknown positions (1 and 3).
- It avoids all eliminated letters (R, I, E, T, N).

This guess will help identify if P or L is in the word and their positions, bringing us closer to solving the puzzle.

- A: correct position (✓) at position 2
- L: absent (x)
- S: correct position (✓) at position 4
- Y: correct position (✓) at position 5

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ A _ S Y
- Confirmed letters in position: 
  - Position 2: A
  - Position 4: S
  - Position 5: Y
- Absent letters: R, I, E, T, N, P, L

We need to find the first and third letters. The first letter (position 1) and the third letter (position 3) must be letters that are not in the absent list and form a valid English word.

The absent letters so far: R, I, E, T, N, P, L.

Possible letters for position 1 and 3: any letter not in {R, I, E, T, N, P, L}. This includes: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note that Y is already used at the end, and A is at position 2, so they might be repeated? We don't have information about duplicates yet.

However, in the pattern _ A _ S Y, the A and S are fixed, and Y is fixed. The first and third positions are open.

We need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but so far, we haven't encountered any duplicates in the feedback. For example, in PALSY, we had S at position 4, but we don't know if S can appear again. Similarly, A and Y might be duplicated.

But to be safe, we should consider both possibilities.

Now, let's think of words that fit the pattern _ A _ S Y.

Possible words:
- We already tried PALSY, which didn't work because P and L are absent.
- Other possibilities: 
  - DAISY: but I is absent, so invalid.
  - MAISY: M A I S Y -> I is absent, invalid.
  - BAISY: not a word? Or B A I S Y, but I absent.
  - GAWSY: not common, and W might be possible? But let's check.

Actually, common words:
- ""HASPY"" - not a common word.
- ""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> but we have S at position 3 and 4. However, in this case, position 3 is S, which we haven't tested directly. But note, in the pattern, position 3 is the third letter, which in GASSY is S. But we know position 4 is S, so if we guess GASSY, we are testing if there is an S at position 3 as well.

But we have to consider the feedback: if the secret word has only one S (at position 4), then the S at position 3 in GASSY would be marked as absent? Or if it's present but in the wrong position? But since position 4 is already S, and if there is no other S, then the S at position 3 should be absent.

But in our case, we know S is at position 4, so we can have a word with two S's.

Similarly, ""MASSY"": M A S S Y.

But let's list valid words that fit _ A _ S Y and don't use absent letters.

The third letter (position 3) must be a letter not absent, and not conflicting.

Possible candidates:
- ""CASKY"" - not a word.
- ""DASHY"": D A S H Y -> but position 3 is S? No: D A S H Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:A, 3:S, 4:H, 5:Y -> but we need position 4 to be S, so this has H at position 4, not S. So invalid pattern.

We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the third letter and then S at fourth.

So the pattern is: [1] A [3] S Y

So the third letter is at position 3, then S at 4.

So, for example:
- ""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> positions: 1:G, 2:A, 3:S, 4:S, 5:Y -> so position 3 is S, position 4 is S.
- ""MASSY"": M A S S Y -> same.
- ""BASSY"": B A S S Y -> same.

But also:
- ""PASSY"" - not common, but similar.

But we have ""PALSY"" which we tried, with L at position 3.

Another word: ""WASPY"": W A S P Y -> positions: 1:W, 2:A, 3:S, 4:P, 5:Y -> but position 4 is P, not S. So invalid.

We need position 4 to be S, so the word must have S at position 4. Therefore, the letter at position 3 can be anything, but the next is S.

So, the only way to have S at position 4 is if the word has ...AS Y, but with a letter in between.

Actually, the word is: letter1, A, letter3, S, Y.

So, for ""GASSY"": letter3 is S, so it's A followed by S (at position 3), then S again at 4? No:

In ""GASSY"":
- Position 1: G
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: Y

So, position 3 is S, position 4 is S. So the pattern is satisfied because position 4 is S.

Similarly, in ""PALSY"", position 3 is L, position 4 is S.

Now, we have eliminated P and L for position 1 and 3 in the last guess.

So, for position 1, we cannot use P, and for position 3, we cannot use L.

Also, we cannot use R,I,E,T,N.

So, what are possible words?

- ""GASSY"": G at position 1, S at position 3. But we haven't tested G or the double S.
- ""BASSY"": B at 1, S at 3.
- ""MASSY"": M at 1, S at 3.
- ""CASSY"": C at 1, S at 3. But ""CASSY"" might be a name, but let's consider if it's valid.
- ""DASSY"": not common.
- ""FASSY"": not common.
- ""HASSY"": not common.
- ""JASSY"": not common.
- ""KASSY"": not common.
- ""SASSY"": S A S S Y -> but position 1 is S, and we have S at position 4. But we don't know if S can be at position 1. Also, we have not tested S at position 1.

""SASSY"": 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: Y

This has three S's. But we know position 4 is S, so it's possible.

But we haven't tested S at position 1 or 3.

Now, we need to choose a guess that tests new letters.

But we have only two positions to guess, and we can try a word that uses new letters for position 1 and 3.

Possible new letters for position 1: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (avoiding R,I,E,T,N,P,L)

For position 3: same, but note that if we use a word with S at position 3, that might be efficient if we think there is a double S.

But we don't have evidence of double S yet.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use S at position 3 to test a different letter.

For example, what other letters can be at position 3?

In ""PALSY"" we tried L, which was absent. So position 3 cannot be L.

What about other letters? For example, ""DAISY"" is out because of I.

""MAYBE"" doesn't have S.

Another word: ""HABIT"" doesn't fit.

Let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and use allowed letters.

Possible words:
- With no double S: 
  - ""WASPY"" - but position 4 is P, not S. No.
  - ""JAZZY"" - no S.
  - ""FAWNY"" - no S.
  - ""CABBY"" - no S.

I think the only common words with the pattern _ A _ S Y are those with double S or PALSY (which we tried).

But PALSY didn't work.

So, perhaps the word has double S.

Let me think: ""GASSY"", ""BASSY"", ""SASSY"", ""MASSY"", etc.

We can try ""GASSY"" to test.

But we have to make a guess.

Another possibility: ""DASHY"" is D A S H Y, but that has S at position 3 and H at 4, not S at 4. So it doesn't fit the pattern.

We need position 4 to be S, so the only way is to have the third letter and then S, so if the third letter is not S, then the word must have a letter at 3 and then S at 4.

For example, ""PALSY"" has L at 3 and S at 4.

Similarly, what about ""BALSY""? Not a word.

""FALSY"" - not common, but in programming, but might not be in word list.

""JASPY"" - not common.

I think we are left with the double S words.

So, let's try ""GASSY"".

In ""GASSY"", we have:
- G at position 1: new letter
- A at 2: known
- S at 3: we are testing if S is present and if it can be at position 3
- S at 4: known
- Y at 5: known

If the secret word is ""GASSY"", we win.

If not, we might get feedback that G is absent or the S at position 3 is not correct (if there is no second S).

But if the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 3 in GASSY would be marked as absent, even though S is in the word, because the only S is at position 4 and is already used.

So, the feedback would show:
- G: ? 
- A: ✓
- S: might be x (if no second S) or ✓ (if there is second S at position 3)
- S: ✓ (because position 4 is S)
- Y: ✓

But the first S (position 3) would be marked as absent if there is no second S.

Alternatively, if the word is ""SASSY"", then position 1 is S, which we haven't tested.

But we don't know if S can be at position 1.

To be systematic, let's choose a word that uses a new letter for position 1 and a new letter for position 3, but if we avoid S at position 3, what are the options?

For example, is there a word like ""BABY"" but 5 letters? No.

""JAGSY"" not a word.

""QUASY"" not a word.

I think the only practical choices are the double S words or perhaps we missed a word.

Another word: ""HASTY"" but position 4 is T, not S.

""PASTY"" same.

""NASTY"" same.

""TASTY"" same.

""RASPY"" has R, which is absent.

""GASPY"" not common.

""WASHY"" W A S H Y -> position 4 is H, not S.

So, I think we have to go with a double S word.

Let's choose ""SASSY"" because it also tests S at position 1.

But position 1 is S, which we haven't tested as absent, but we know S is in the word at position 4, so it could be at position 1 as well.

So, ""SASSY"" has S at position 1, A at 2, S at 3, S at 4, Y at 5.

If we guess ""SASSY"", and the secret word is ""GASSY"", then:
- Position 1: S vs G, so S would be marked as absent? But S is in the word at position 4, so if there is only one S, then S at position 1 and 3 would be marked as absent or wrong position? 

This might be messy.

Perhaps ""GASSY"" is a safer guess because it uses a new letter G.

Let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and allowed letters:

- GASSY: G at 1, S at 3
- BASSY: B at 1, S at 3
- CASSY: C at 1, S at 3 (CASSY is a name, but might be accepted)
- MASSY: M at 1, S at 3
- SASSY: S at 1, S at 3
- etc.

We can try ""BASIS"" but doesn't end with Y.

Given that, I'll go with ""GASSY"" as the next guess.

But we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that tests two new letters without S at position 3.

For example, is there a word like ""DADDY"" but no S.

Or ""FADDY"" not a word.

""JUDGY"" not.

I think it's hard, so I'll go with ""GASSY"".

So, guess: GASSY

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If the secret word is ""GASSY"", we win.

If not, and if G is absent, then we know position 1 is not G, and the S at position 3 might be absent (if no second S), then we know position 3 is not S, and we can try other letters.

But if position 3 is not S, then what other letter can it be? We have no other common words.

Unless we missed a word.

Another word: ""DALLY"" but no S.

""GALLY"" not.

""PALLY"" has P and L, which are absent.

I think we have to try.

Perhaps ""HAPPY"" but no S.

I think ""GASSY"" is the best bet.

So, I'll go with that.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: 
     - R (absent), A (correct position 2), I (absent), S (correct position 4), E (absent).
   - **Guess 2 (TANSY)**:
     - T (absent), A (correct position 2), N (absent), S (correct position 4), Y (correct position 5).
   - **Guess 3 (PALSY)**:
     - P (absent), A (correct position 2), L (absent), S (correct position 4), Y (correct position 5).

2. **Deductions from Feedback**:
   - The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ A _ S Y` (positions: 2=A, 4=S, 5=Y).
   - Confirmed absent letters: **R, I, E, T, N, P, L** (from all guesses).
   - Unknown positions: **1 and 3** need to be filled with letters not in the absent list.
   - Possible letters for positions 1 and 3: Any letter not in {R, I, E, T, N, P, L}, such as B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. Note that A, S, and Y are confirmed but could potentially repeat (though no evidence yet).

3. **Evaluate Possible Words**:
   - The pattern `_ A _ S Y` limits options. Common words fitting this pattern include:
     - **GASSY**: G at position 1, S at position 3.
     - **BASSY**: B at position 1, S at position 3.
     - **MASSY**: M at position 1, S at position 3.
     - **SASSY**: S at position 1, S at position 3.
   - Words like DAISY or PALSY are invalid (contain absent letters I or L/P).
   - Since position 3 could be S (allowing double S), testing a word with S at position 3 is efficient. It tests if a second S exists and uses new letters for position 1.
   - **Why choose GASSY?** 
     - It tests a new letter (G) for position 1 and S for position 3.
     - If G is correct, we solve position 1. If not, we eliminate G.
     - The S at position 3 tests for a potential double S (if present, it confirms; if absent, it rules out S for position 3).
     - GASSY is a valid English word (meaning ""resembling or full of gas""), avoiding absent letters.

4. **Strategy**:
   - With only positions 1 and 3 unknown, GASSY maximizes information by testing a new consonant (G) and the double-S possibility.
   - If GASSY is incorrect, feedback on G and the position 3 S will narrow options further (e.g., if S at position 3 is absent, we eliminate double S and focus on other letters for position 3 like B, M, etc.).

So, TANSY? Not common. \n- We need 5-letter words.\n\nCommon words:\n- TASKS: T A S K S -> but the fourth letter is K, not S? Wait, let\'s break down: \n  Position: 1: T, 2: A, 3: S, 4: K, 5: S -> that doesn\'t fit because we need S at the fourth position, but here the fourth is K and fifth is S. Also, we have S at the third and fifth, but we know the fourth is S, so that might be acceptable? Actually, the pattern is _ A _ S _, so:\n  Position 1: any\n  Position 2: A\n  Position 3: any\n  Position 4: S\n  Position 5: any\n\nSo, TASKS: \n- Position 1: T\n- Position 2: A -> good\n- Position 3: S -> but we don\'t know about position 3, so that\'s okay\n- Position 4: K -> but we need S at position 4? Wait, no: in TASKS, the fourth letter is K (if we count: 1:T, 2:A, 3:S, 4:K, 5:S). So the fourth letter is K, not S. So that doesn\'t match.\n\nWe need a word where the fourth letter is S. So the pattern is: \nLetter1: ?, Letter2: A, Letter3: ?, Letter4: S, Letter5: ?\n\nExamples:\n- CLASS: C L A S S -> but that\'s A at position 3, not 2. So no.\n- PASTA: P A S T A -> but then position 3 is S, but we need position 4 to be S? \n  Let\'s break: \n  P (1), A (2), S (3), T (4), A (5) -> so position 4 is T, not S.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be S. So:\n\n- GAWKS: G A W K S -> position 4 is K, not S.\n- BASTS: B A S T S -> position 4 is T? \n  B(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), S(5) -> position 4 is T.\n\nI think I\'m having trouble. Let me think of words ending with S? But we need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the fourth letter as S, meaning the last two letters are the fifth and the fourth is S? Not necessarily, because the fifth can be anything.\n\nActually, the word must have the structure: \n[letter1] A [letter3] S [letter5]\n\nSo, for example:\n- MASTS: M A S T S -> \n  M(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), S(5) -> but position 4 is T, not S. We need position 4 to be S? \n  Wait, no: in MASTS, the letters are: \n  Position 1: M\n  Position 2: A\n  Position 3: S\n  Position 4: T\n  Position 5: S\n\nThat doesn\'t have S at position 4.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be S. So the word must have the fourth character as S. \n\nFor example:\n- The word ""PASS"" is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.\n\nLet me think of 5-letter words with S at the fourth position and A at the second.\n\nExamples:\n- CAUSE: C A U S E -> \n  C(1), A(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E is already eliminated (from first feedback: E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.\n\n- FEAST: F E A S T -> \n  F(1), E(2), A(3), S(4), T(5) -> but position 2 is E, not A. We need A at position 2.\n\nWe need A at position 2 and S at position 4.\n\nSo:\n- Letter1: ?\n- Letter2: A\n- Letter3: ?\n- Letter4: S\n- Letter5: ?\n\nAnd the word must not contain R, I, E.\n\nPossible words:\n- HASTY: H A S T Y -> \n  H(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but position 4 is T, not S. We need position 4 to be S, so the third letter is free, but the fourth must be S.\n\nIn HASTY, the fourth letter is T, not S.\n\nI think I\'m making a mistake. Let me clarify: the fourth letter must be S, so in the word, the character at index 3 (if we start counting at 0) or index 4? \n\nIn the feedback, we count positions starting from 1.\n\nFor the word ""RAISE"":\n- R is position 1\n- A is position 2\n- I is position 3\n- S is position 4\n- E is position 5\n\nSo, the feedback said A is correct at position 2 and S is correct at position 4.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n- Position 1: unknown, but not R (since R is not in the word)\n- Position 2: A\n- Position 3: unknown, but not I (since I is not in the word)\n- Position 4: S\n- Position 5: unknown, but not E\n\nSo the pattern is: [not R, not I, not E] A [not R, not I, not E] S [not R, not I, not E]\n\nNow, we need to find a word that fits: _ A _ S _\n\nAnd we must avoid the letters R, I, E.\n\nLet me list some words that fit this pattern:\n\n- TALKS: T A L K S -> \n  Position 1: T, 2: A, 3: L, 4: K, 5: S -> but position 4 is K, not S. We need position 4 to be S.\n\n- We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the fourth character as S.\n\nExamples of words with second letter A and fourth letter S:\n\n- GAZES: but has E and Z? And E is eliminated.\n- JAZZY: J A Z Z Y -> position 4 is Z, not S.\n- I\'m struggling. Let me think of common words.\n\nAnother idea: ""BASIS"" -> B A S I S -> \n  B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5) -> but position 4 is I, not S. And I is eliminated.\n\n""CASKS"": C A S K S -> \n  C(1), A(2), S(3), K(4), S(5) -> position 4 is K.\n\n""PASSE"": P A S S E -> \n  P(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E is eliminated.\n\n""MASSE"": same issue with E.\n\n""WASPS"": W A S P S -> \n  W(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), S(5) -> position 4 is P.\n\nI need to look for words where the fourth letter is S. That means the word has the structure: ??A?S? but with the fourth letter being the fourth character.\n\nActually, the fourth character is the one at index 3 (if we index from 0). So in a 5-letter word, the positions are:\nIndex 0: first letter\nIndex 1: second letter\nIndex 2: third letter\nIndex 3: fourth letter\nIndex 4: fifth letter\n\nWe need:\nIndex 1: A\nIndex 3: S\n\nSo, the word: [0] A [2] S [4]\n\nAnd [0], [2], [4] cannot be R, I, E, and also not the letters we know are absent.\n\nNow, let me think of words:\n\n- ""HASTE"": H A S T E -> \n  [0]:H, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> but [3] is T, not S. And we need [3] to be S.\n\nI think I found one: ""CAUSE"" has [3] as S? \nC A U S E: \n[0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:U, [3]:S, [4]:E -> yes, but [4] is E which is eliminated.\n\n- ""PAUSE"": same issue.\n\n- ""TASTE"": T A S T E -> \n  [0]:T, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> [3] is T, not S.\n\n- ""BASTE"": same as TASTE.\n\n- ""PASTE"": P A S T E -> \n  [0]:P, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> [3] is T.\n\nI need to find a word where the fourth letter (index 3) is S.\n\nFor example:\n- ""GASPS"": G A S P S -> \n  [0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:P, [4]:S -> [3] is P.\n\n- ""CLASS"": C L A S S -> \n  [0]:C, [1]:L, [2]:A, [3]:S, [4]:S -> but [1] is L, not A. We need [1] to be A.\n\nWe need [1] to be A and [3] to be S.\n\nSo, the word must have:\n- The second letter (index 1) is A.\n- The fourth letter (index 3) is S.\n\nSo, the structure: \nLetter0: ?\nLetter1: A\nLetter2: ?\nLetter3: S\nLetter4: ?\n\nAnd the word must not contain R, I, E.\n\nLet me search my vocabulary:\n\n- ""DAISY"": D A I S Y -> \n  [0]:D, [1]:A, [2]:I, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> but I is eliminated (from first feedback: I is not in the word). So we cannot use I.\n\n- ""HASTY"": H A S T Y -> \n  [0]:H, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:Y -> [3] is T, not S.\n\n- ""NASTY"": N A S T Y -> same, [3] is T.\n\n- ""PASTY"": P A S T Y -> same.\n\n- ""TANSY"": T A N S Y -> \n  [0]:T, [1]:A, [2]:N, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> yes! [3] is S.\n\nSo, ""TANSY"" is a word? It means a type of plant. But is it common? In Wordle, the word list might include it.\n\nBut let\'s check the letters: T, A, N, S, Y. \n- T: not eliminated\n- A: we know is in\n- N: new\n- S: we know is in\n- Y: new\n\nAnd it doesn\'t contain R, I, E.\n\nSo, ""TANSY"" fits the pattern and uses new letters.\n\nAnother word: ""MANGO"" doesn\'t have S at position 4.\n\n""BASSO"" is not common.\n\n""CASAS"": C A S A S -> \n  [0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:A, [4]:S -> [3] is A, not S.\n\n""LASSI"": L A S S I -> \n  [0]:L, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:I -> [3] is S, but [4] is I which is eliminated.\n\n""PASHA"": P A S H A -> \n  [0]:P, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:H, [4]:A -> [3] is H.\n\nI think ""TANSY"" is a candidate.\n\nAnother one: ""JASPS"" is not common.\n\nOr ""VASAL"", but [3] is A.\n\nPerhaps ""TAWSE"", but has E.\n\nI think ""TANSY"" is acceptable.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to guess any valid 5-letter word, not necessarily one that fits the known positions. However, it\'s efficient to use the known positions to test other letters.\n\nAlternatively, we might choose a word that doesn\'t have A in position 2 and S in position 4, but that would waste the known information. It\'s better to use them to get more information about the other positions.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""TANSY"".\n\nBut let me confirm: TANSY is a valid word? Yes, it\'s in the dictionary.\n\nSo, guess: TANSY\n\nWe hope to get feedback that tells us about T, N, Y and also confirms A and S (which we already know).\n\nBut note: we know A and S are in the word, but in TANSY, A is at position 2 and S is at position 4, which are the correct positions? We know they are correct, so we expect them to be marked as correct.\n\nHowever, the feedback might show:\n- T: ? \n- A: should be ✓\n- N: ?\n- S: should be ✓\n- Y: ?\n\nBut the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know, but in this case, TANSY has unique letters.\n\nAlternatively, we might choose a word that has different letters to test more.\n\nBut with the constraints, TANSY is a good choice.\n\nAnother common word: ""PASTA"" doesn\'t fit because [3] is T.\n\nOr ""MASTA"" not a word.\n\nI think TANSY is fine.\n\nBut let me think of a more common word: ""HASTY"" doesn\'t have S at [3].\n\nWhat about ""BASES"": B A S E S -> \n  [0]:B, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:E, [4]:S -> [3] is E, eliminated.\n\n""CASES"": same.\n\n""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> \n  [0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> [3] is S! Yes.\n\nSo, ""GASSY"" is a word. It means containing gas or gaseous.\n\nLetters: G, A, S, S, Y. \n- G: new\n- A: known\n- S: known (but we have two S\'s)\n- Y: new\n\nBut note: the feedback for the first guess said S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4). It didn\'t say anything about multiple S\'s. So there could be multiple S\'s.\n\nIn ""GASSY"", we have S at position 2 and 3? \n[0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:Y\n\nSo position 4 is [3] which is S, so that matches. And position 2 is A, which matches.\n\nBut we have an extra S at position 2? [2] is S.\n\nThe secret word might have an S at position 3? We don\'t know.\n\nBut in our first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was correct. We didn\'t have S at position 3 in the first guess (we had I at position 3). So we don\'t know about position 3.\n\nSo ""GASSY"" is also a candidate.\n\nBut ""GASSY"" has two S\'s. It might be a good test because if the secret word has only one S, then one of the S\'s in GASSY might be marked as wrong position or not present? But we know position 4 must be S, so the S at position 3 in GASSY might be additional.\n\nBut to avoid complexity, maybe a word with unique letters is better. TANSY has unique letters.\n\nHowever, TANSY is less common. Let me see if there\'s a more common word.\n\nAnother word: ""PAYSA"" not a word.\n\n""TASSA"" not common.\n\n""CANST"": C A N S T -> \n  [0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:N, [3]:S, [4]:T -> yes! [3] is S.\n\n""CANST"" is an archaic word for can or container, but might be in the word list.\n\n""HASTY"" doesn\'t work.\n\n""NASTY"" doesn\'t work.\n\n""PASTY"" doesn\'t work.\n\n""RASTA"" has R, which is eliminated.\n\nI think ""TANSY"" or ""GASSY"" or ""CANST"" are options.\n\nBut ""GASSY"" is in the Wordle word list, I believe.\n\nTo maximize new letters, TANSY has T, N, Y which are new.\n\nGASSY has G and Y, but S is repeated.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, I\'d prefer to test more new letters.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""TANSY"".\n\nBut let me check: in the first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was correct. In TANSY, we are putting S at position 4 again, which is safe because we know it\'s correct. And A at position 2 is also correct.\n\nThe new letters are T at 1, N at 3, Y at 5.\n\nSo, after this guess, we will know about T, N, Y.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""TANSY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R, I, and E are not in the secret word.\n- A is in the correct position (position 2).\n- S is in the correct position (position 4).\n\nThe secret word must have the form: _ A _ S _, and it cannot contain R, I, or E. For the second guess, I chose ""TANSY"" because:\n- It fits the known pattern (A at position 2, S at position 4).\n- It introduces new common letters (T, N, Y) that haven\'t been tested yet.\n- It avoids the eliminated letters (R, I, E).\n\nThis guess will help test the presence of T, N, and Y, and confirm the positions of A and S.\n\n<guess>TANSY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: TANSY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) N(x) S(✓) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so position 2 is A)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- S: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so position 4 is S)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: TANSY\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, position 2 is A, confirmed again)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- S: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, position 4 is S, confirmed again)\n- Y: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so position 5 is Y)\n\nSo, from the feedback, we now know:\n- The secret word has the second letter A, fourth letter S, and fifth letter Y. So the pattern is: _ A _ S Y\n- We also know that the letters R, I, E, T, N are not in the word.\n\nTherefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter1] A [letter3] S Y\n\nAnd we need to find letter1 and letter3, which cannot be R, I, E, T, N, and also not any other eliminated letters. Currently, eliminated letters are: R, I, E, T, N.\n\nWe have two positions to guess: position 1 and position 3.\n\nWe need to make a third guess. We should choose a word that fits the pattern and uses new letters to test for position 1 and 3.\n\nThe pattern: [1] A [3] S Y\n\nWe know position 1 and 3 must be filled with letters not in the eliminated set.\n\nCommon letters that haven\'t been tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (but note, we have to form a valid word).\n\nWe need to find a word that has the form: [1] A [3] S Y\n\nLet\'s think of possible words:\n\n- DAISY: but D A I S Y -> I is eliminated, so not allowed.\n- HAWKS: H A W K S -> but the last letter is S, not Y, and we need Y at the end. Also, the pattern requires S at position 4 and Y at 5, so HAWKS ends with KS, not SY.\n- We need the word to end with ""SY"".\n\nSo, the last three letters are A (at 2), then S (at 4), and Y (at 5). But note: position 3 is between A and S, so the word has: letter1, then A, then letter3, then S, then Y.\n\nSo the word is: [1]A[3]SY\n\nExamples:\n- DAISY: D A I S Y -> but I is eliminated.\n- PANSY: P A N S Y -> but N is eliminated (from guess 2, N is not in the word).\n- MOSSY: M O S S Y -> but position 2 is O, not A.\n- JAZZY: J A Z Z Y -> but then position 3 is Z, position 4 is Z, not S. We need position 4 to be S.\n\nWe need position 4 to be S, so the word must have S at the fourth position and Y at the fifth.\n\nSo, the third letter (position 3) is before the S, so the word has: [1] A [3] S Y\n\nPossible words:\n- ""HASPY"" - not a common word.\n- ""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> but then position 3 is S, and position 4 is S. So the word is G A S S Y. \n  - This has S at position 3 and S at position 4. But we know position 4 is S, so that\'s fine. However, in this case, position 3 is also S. But we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s or not.\n\nBut in ""GASSY"", the pattern is:\n  Position 1: G\n  Position 2: A\n  Position 3: S\n  Position 4: S\n  Position 5: Y\n\nBut we know position 4 is S, so if we guess GASSY, then:\n- Position 2: A is correct (we know)\n- Position 4: S is correct (we know)\n- Position 5: Y is correct (we know from guess 2)\n\nBut we are testing position 1 (G) and position 3 (S). However, if the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 3 might be marked as absent or wrong position? But we know position 4 has S, so if there is only one S, then the S at position 3 would be extra and might be marked as not present? But actually, in Wordle, if there is only one S and it is at position 4, then the S at position 3 would be marked as absent (x) because the single S is already used at position 4.\n\nBut in our case, we know position 4 is S, so if the secret word has another S, then it might be possible.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid using S at position 3 to not complicate.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words ending with ""SY"" and having A at position 2.\n\nThe only common word I can think of is ""DANDY"" but that doesn\'t have S.\n\nAnother one: ""LASSY"" - but L A S S Y, same as GASSY.\n\nOr ""MASSY"": M A S S Y.\n\nBut these all have S at position 3.\n\nWhat about ""PALSY"": P A L S Y -> \n  Position 1: P\n  Position 2: A\n  Position 3: L\n  Position 4: S\n  Position 5: Y\n\nYes! This fits perfectly: P A L S Y.\n\nAnd L is a new letter, not eliminated.\n\nSimilarly, ""BALSY"" - not a word.\n\n""JALSY"" - not a word.\n\n""WALSY"" - not common.\n\nSo ""PALSY"" is a valid word, meaning a condition.\n\nAnother one: ""HALSY"" - not common.\n\n""GAYLY"" - G A Y L Y -> but position 3 is Y, and position 5 is Y, but we need position 4 to be S, which it\'s not.\n\nSo, ""PALSY"" seems a good candidate.\n\nAnother possibility: ""FANCY"" but no S.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be S, so it must be ...S at the end, but with Y at the end, so ...SY.\n\nSo, the only common words I can think of are those with double S like GASSY, MASSY, or PALSY.\n\nBut PALSY has L at position 3.\n\nAlso, ""DAISY"" is out because of I.\n\nSo, I think ""PALSY"" is a good guess.\n\nWe can also consider ""HASTY"", but H A S T Y -> position 4 is T, not S. We need position 4 to be S.\n\nNo, we know position 4 is S, so we must have S at position 4.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""PALSY"".\n\nIn ""PALSY"":\n- P: new letter\n- A: known correct\n- L: new letter\n- S: known correct\n- Y: known correct\n\nWe are testing P and L.\n\nIf the secret word is ""PALSY"", then we win.\n\nOtherwise, we get feedback on P and L.\n\nBut note: we have only two positions unknown, so we might solve it in this guess or the next.\n\nAnother word: ""JAZZY"" doesn\'t have S.\n\nOr ""BUSKY"" not common.\n\nI think ""PALSY"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let me confirm if there are other options.\n\n""CASKY"" not a word.\n\n""BASSO"" doesn\'t end with Y.\n\nWe know the word ends with Y, because position 5 is Y.\n\nSo, the word must end with SY.\n\nOther words: ""MOSSY"" has O at position 2, not A.\n\n""FUSSY"" has U at position 2.\n\nSo, ""PALSY"" seems the best.\n\nWe could guess a word that doesn\'t have A, S, Y in their positions to test more letters, but that would be inefficient because we know those positions are fixed. It\'s better to use the known positions to focus on the unknown ones.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""PALSY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: A is correct and in position 2, S is correct and in position 4. R, I, and E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (TANSY)**: A (position 2), S (position 4), and Y (position 5) are correct. T and N are absent.\n\nThe secret word must have the pattern: `_ A _ S Y`, with positions 2, 4, and 5 confirmed. Absent letters are R, I, E, T, and N.\n\nFor the third guess, I chose **PALSY** because:\n- It fits the known pattern (A at position 2, S at position 4, Y at position 5).\n- It tests new common letters (P and L) for the unknown positions (1 and 3).\n- It avoids all eliminated letters (R, I, E, T, N).\n\nThis guess will help identify if P or L is in the word and their positions, bringing us closer to solving the puzzle.\n\n<guess>PALSY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: TANSY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) N(x) S(✓) Y(✓)\nGuess 3: PALSY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) L(x) S(✓) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE\n- R: absent (x)\n- A: correct position (✓) at position 2\n- I: absent (x)\n- S: correct position (✓) at position 4\n- E: absent (x)\n\nGuess 2: TANSY\n- T: absent (x)\n- A: correct position (✓) at position 2\n- N: absent (x)\n- S: correct position (✓) at position 4\n- Y: correct position (✓) at position 5\n\nGuess 3: PALSY\n- P: absent (x)\n- A: correct position (✓) at position 2\n- L: absent (x)\n- S: correct position (✓) at position 4\n- Y: correct position (✓) at position 5\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word has the pattern: _ A _ S Y\n- Confirmed letters in position: \n  - Position 2: A\n  - Position 4: S\n  - Position 5: Y\n- Absent letters: R, I, E, T, N, P, L\n\nWe need to find the first and third letters. The first letter (position 1) and the third letter (position 3) must be letters that are not in the absent list and form a valid English word.\n\nThe absent letters so far: R, I, E, T, N, P, L.\n\nPossible letters for position 1 and 3: any letter not in {R, I, E, T, N, P, L}. This includes: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note that Y is already used at the end, and A is at position 2, so they might be repeated? We don\'t have information about duplicates yet.\n\nHowever, in the pattern _ A _ S Y, the A and S are fixed, and Y is fixed. The first and third positions are open.\n\nWe need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but so far, we haven\'t encountered any duplicates in the feedback. For example, in PALSY, we had S at position 4, but we don\'t know if S can appear again. Similarly, A and Y might be duplicated.\n\nBut to be safe, we should consider both possibilities.\n\nNow, let\'s think of words that fit the pattern _ A _ S Y.\n\nPossible words:\n- We already tried PALSY, which didn\'t work because P and L are absent.\n- Other possibilities: \n  - DAISY: but I is absent, so invalid.\n  - MAISY: M A I S Y -> I is absent, invalid.\n  - BAISY: not a word? Or B A I S Y, but I absent.\n  - GAWSY: not common, and W might be possible? But let\'s check.\n\nActually, common words:\n- ""HASPY"" - not a common word.\n- ""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> but we have S at position 3 and 4. However, in this case, position 3 is S, which we haven\'t tested directly. But note, in the pattern, position 3 is the third letter, which in GASSY is S. But we know position 4 is S, so if we guess GASSY, we are testing if there is an S at position 3 as well.\n\nBut we have to consider the feedback: if the secret word has only one S (at position 4), then the S at position 3 in GASSY would be marked as absent? Or if it\'s present but in the wrong position? But since position 4 is already S, and if there is no other S, then the S at position 3 should be absent.\n\nBut in our case, we know S is at position 4, so we can have a word with two S\'s.\n\nSimilarly, ""MASSY"": M A S S Y.\n\nBut let\'s list valid words that fit _ A _ S Y and don\'t use absent letters.\n\nThe third letter (position 3) must be a letter not absent, and not conflicting.\n\nPossible candidates:\n- ""CASKY"" - not a word.\n- ""DASHY"": D A S H Y -> but position 3 is S? No: D A S H Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:A, 3:S, 4:H, 5:Y -> but we need position 4 to be S, so this has H at position 4, not S. So invalid pattern.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the third letter and then S at fourth.\n\nSo the pattern is: [1] A [3] S Y\n\nSo the third letter is at position 3, then S at 4.\n\nSo, for example:\n- ""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> positions: 1:G, 2:A, 3:S, 4:S, 5:Y -> so position 3 is S, position 4 is S.\n- ""MASSY"": M A S S Y -> same.\n- ""BASSY"": B A S S Y -> same.\n\nBut also:\n- ""PASSY"" - not common, but similar.\n\nBut we have ""PALSY"" which we tried, with L at position 3.\n\nAnother word: ""WASPY"": W A S P Y -> positions: 1:W, 2:A, 3:S, 4:P, 5:Y -> but position 4 is P, not S. So invalid.\n\nWe need position 4 to be S, so the word must have S at position 4. Therefore, the letter at position 3 can be anything, but the next is S.\n\nSo, the only way to have S at position 4 is if the word has ...AS Y, but with a letter in between.\n\nActually, the word is: letter1, A, letter3, S, Y.\n\nSo, for ""GASSY"": letter3 is S, so it\'s A followed by S (at position 3), then S again at 4? No:\n\nIn ""GASSY"":\n- Position 1: G\n- Position 2: A\n- Position 3: S\n- Position 4: S\n- Position 5: Y\n\nSo, position 3 is S, position 4 is S. So the pattern is satisfied because position 4 is S.\n\nSimilarly, in ""PALSY"", position 3 is L, position 4 is S.\n\nNow, we have eliminated P and L for position 1 and 3 in the last guess.\n\nSo, for position 1, we cannot use P, and for position 3, we cannot use L.\n\nAlso, we cannot use R,I,E,T,N.\n\nSo, what are possible words?\n\n- ""GASSY"": G at position 1, S at position 3. But we haven\'t tested G or the double S.\n- ""BASSY"": B at 1, S at 3.\n- ""MASSY"": M at 1, S at 3.\n- ""CASSY"": C at 1, S at 3. But ""CASSY"" might be a name, but let\'s consider if it\'s valid.\n- ""DASSY"": not common.\n- ""FASSY"": not common.\n- ""HASSY"": not common.\n- ""JASSY"": not common.\n- ""KASSY"": not common.\n- ""SASSY"": S A S S Y -> but position 1 is S, and we have S at position 4. But we don\'t know if S can be at position 1. Also, we have not tested S at position 1.\n\n""SASSY"": \n- Position 1: S\n- Position 2: A\n- Position 3: S\n- Position 4: S\n- Position 5: Y\n\nThis has three S\'s. But we know position 4 is S, so it\'s possible.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested S at position 1 or 3.\n\nNow, we need to choose a guess that tests new letters.\n\nBut we have only two positions to guess, and we can try a word that uses new letters for position 1 and 3.\n\nPossible new letters for position 1: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (avoiding R,I,E,T,N,P,L)\n\nFor position 3: same, but note that if we use a word with S at position 3, that might be efficient if we think there is a double S.\n\nBut we don\'t have evidence of double S yet.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t use S at position 3 to test a different letter.\n\nFor example, what other letters can be at position 3?\n\nIn ""PALSY"" we tried L, which was absent. So position 3 cannot be L.\n\nWhat about other letters? For example, ""DAISY"" is out because of I.\n\n""MAYBE"" doesn\'t have S.\n\nAnother word: ""HABIT"" doesn\'t fit.\n\nLet\'s list all possible words that fit the pattern and use allowed letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- With no double S: \n  - ""WASPY"" - but position 4 is P, not S. No.\n  - ""JAZZY"" - no S.\n  - ""FAWNY"" - no S.\n  - ""CABBY"" - no S.\n\nI think the only common words with the pattern _ A _ S Y are those with double S or PALSY (which we tried).\n\nBut PALSY didn\'t work.\n\nSo, perhaps the word has double S.\n\nLet me think: ""GASSY"", ""BASSY"", ""SASSY"", ""MASSY"", etc.\n\nWe can try ""GASSY"" to test.\n\nBut we have to make a guess.\n\nAnother possibility: ""DASHY"" is D A S H Y, but that has S at position 3 and H at 4, not S at 4. So it doesn\'t fit the pattern.\n\nWe need position 4 to be S, so the only way is to have the third letter and then S, so if the third letter is not S, then the word must have a letter at 3 and then S at 4.\n\nFor example, ""PALSY"" has L at 3 and S at 4.\n\nSimilarly, what about ""BALSY""? Not a word.\n\n""FALSY"" - not common, but in programming, but might not be in word list.\n\n""JASPY"" - not common.\n\nI think we are left with the double S words.\n\nSo, let\'s try ""GASSY"".\n\nIn ""GASSY"", we have:\n- G at position 1: new letter\n- A at 2: known\n- S at 3: we are testing if S is present and if it can be at position 3\n- S at 4: known\n- Y at 5: known\n\nIf the secret word is ""GASSY"", we win.\n\nIf not, we might get feedback that G is absent or the S at position 3 is not correct (if there is no second S).\n\nBut if the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 3 in GASSY would be marked as absent, even though S is in the word, because the only S is at position 4 and is already used.\n\nSo, the feedback would show:\n- G: ? \n- A: ✓\n- S: might be x (if no second S) or ✓ (if there is second S at position 3)\n- S: ✓ (because position 4 is S)\n- Y: ✓\n\nBut the first S (position 3) would be marked as absent if there is no second S.\n\nAlternatively, if the word is ""SASSY"", then position 1 is S, which we haven\'t tested.\n\nBut we don\'t know if S can be at position 1.\n\nTo be systematic, let\'s choose a word that uses a new letter for position 1 and a new letter for position 3, but if we avoid S at position 3, what are the options?\n\nFor example, is there a word like ""BABY"" but 5 letters? No.\n\n""JAGSY"" not a word.\n\n""QUASY"" not a word.\n\nI think the only practical choices are the double S words or perhaps we missed a word.\n\nAnother word: ""HASTY"" but position 4 is T, not S.\n\n""PASTY"" same.\n\n""NASTY"" same.\n\n""TASTY"" same.\n\n""RASPY"" has R, which is absent.\n\n""GASPY"" not common.\n\n""WASHY"" W A S H Y -> position 4 is H, not S.\n\nSo, I think we have to go with a double S word.\n\nLet\'s choose ""SASSY"" because it also tests S at position 1.\n\nBut position 1 is S, which we haven\'t tested as absent, but we know S is in the word at position 4, so it could be at position 1 as well.\n\nSo, ""SASSY"" has S at position 1, A at 2, S at 3, S at 4, Y at 5.\n\nIf we guess ""SASSY"", and the secret word is ""GASSY"", then:\n- Position 1: S vs G, so S would be marked as absent? But S is in the word at position 4, so if there is only one S, then S at position 1 and 3 would be marked as absent or wrong position? \n\nThis might be messy.\n\nPerhaps ""GASSY"" is a safer guess because it uses a new letter G.\n\nLet\'s list all possible words that fit the pattern and allowed letters:\n\n- GASSY: G at 1, S at 3\n- BASSY: B at 1, S at 3\n- CASSY: C at 1, S at 3 (CASSY is a name, but might be accepted)\n- MASSY: M at 1, S at 3\n- SASSY: S at 1, S at 3\n- etc.\n\nWe can try ""BASIS"" but doesn\'t end with Y.\n\nGiven that, I\'ll go with ""GASSY"" as the next guess.\n\nBut we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use a word that tests two new letters without S at position 3.\n\nFor example, is there a word like ""DADDY"" but no S.\n\nOr ""FADDY"" not a word.\n\n""JUDGY"" not.\n\nI think it\'s hard, so I\'ll go with ""GASSY"".\n\nSo, guess: GASSY\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nIf the secret word is ""GASSY"", we win.\n\nIf not, and if G is absent, then we know position 1 is not G, and the S at position 3 might be absent (if no second S), then we know position 3 is not S, and we can try other letters.\n\nBut if position 3 is not S, then what other letter can it be? We have no other common words.\n\nUnless we missed a word.\n\nAnother word: ""DALLY"" but no S.\n\n""GALLY"" not.\n\n""PALLY"" has P and L, which are absent.\n\nI think we have to try.\n\nPerhaps ""HAPPY"" but no S.\n\nI think ""GASSY"" is the best bet.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with that.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Review Previous Feedback**:\n   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: \n     - R (absent), A (correct position 2), I (absent), S (correct position 4), E (absent).\n   - **Guess 2 (TANSY)**:\n     - T (absent), A (correct position 2), N (absent), S (correct position 4), Y (correct position 5).\n   - **Guess 3 (PALSY)**:\n     - P (absent), A (correct position 2), L (absent), S (correct position 4), Y (correct position 5).\n\n2. **Deductions from Feedback**:\n   - The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ A _ S Y` (positions: 2=A, 4=S, 5=Y).\n   - Confirmed absent letters: **R, I, E, T, N, P, L** (from all guesses).\n   - Unknown positions: **1 and 3** need to be filled with letters not in the absent list.\n   - Possible letters for positions 1 and 3: Any letter not in {R, I, E, T, N, P, L}, such as B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. Note that A, S, and Y are confirmed but could potentially repeat (though no evidence yet).\n\n3. **Evaluate Possible Words**:\n   - The pattern `_ A _ S Y` limits options. Common words fitting this pattern include:\n     - **GASSY**: G at position 1, S at position 3.\n     - **BASSY**: B at position 1, S at position 3.\n     - **MASSY**: M at position 1, S at position 3.\n     - **SASSY**: S at position 1, S at position 3.\n   - Words like DAISY or PALSY are invalid (contain absent letters I or L/P).\n   - Since position 3 could be S (allowing double S), testing a word with S at position 3 is efficient. It tests if a second S exists and uses new letters for position 1.\n   - **Why choose GASSY?** \n     - It tests a new letter (G) for position 1 and S for position 3.\n     - If G is correct, we solve position 1. If not, we eliminate G.\n     - The S at position 3 tests for a potential double S (if present, it confirms; if absent, it rules out S for position 3).\n     - GASSY is a valid English word (meaning ""resembling or full of gas""), avoiding absent letters.\n\n4. **Strategy**:\n   - With only positions 1 and 3 unknown, GASSY maximizes information by testing a new consonant (G) and the double-S possibility.\n   - If GASSY is incorrect, feedback on G and the position 3 S will narrow options further (e.g., if S at position 3 is absent, we eliminate double S and focus on other letters for position 3 like B, M, etc.).\n\n<guess>GASSY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: TANSY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) N(x) S(✓) Y(✓)\nGuess 3: PALSY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) L(x) S(✓) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: GASSY -> FEEDBACK: G(x) A(✓) S(✓) S(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE → R(x), A(✓ position 2), I(x), S(✓ position 4), E(x)
Guess 2: TANSY → T(x), A(✓ position 2), N(x), S(✓ position 4), Y(✓ position 5)
Guess 3: PALSY → P(x), A(✓ position 2), L(x), S(✓ position 4), Y(✓ position 5)
Guess 4: GASSY → G(x), A(✓ position 2), S(✓), S(✓), Y(✓)

For Guess 4: GASSY
- The word is G A S S Y
- Feedback: G(x), A(✓), S(✓), S(✓), Y(✓)

Breakdown:
- Position 1: G → marked (x) → absent
- Position 2: A → marked (✓) → correct (as we know)
- Position 3: S → marked (✓) → this means the S at position 3 is in the word and in the correct position? But we already knew S is at position 4. This suggests that there is an additional S at position 3.
- Position 4: S → marked (✓) → correct (as we know)
- Position 5: Y → marked (✓) → correct (as we know)

The feedback for S at position 3 being (✓) means:
- The letter S is present and correctly placed at position 3.
- But position 3 is the third position, which we didn't know before.

However, this adds new information: we now know that position 3 must be S because it's marked as correct.

But let's recall:
The secret word has:
- Position 2: A
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: Y

And now from Guess 4, we have:
- Position 3: S is marked correct → so the secret word has S at position 3.

Therefore, the secret word must be: _ A S S Y

Because:
- Position 3 is S (from this feedback)
- Position 4 is S (already known)

So the secret word is: [letter1] A S S Y

And we know position 1 is not G (since G is absent).

Also, from previous feedbacks, we have absent letters: R, I, E, T, N, P, L, and now G.

So position 1 cannot be any of R,I,E,T,N,P,L,G.

The pattern is: [1] A S S Y

We need to find position 1, which must be a letter not in the absent set.

The secret word is fixed except the first letter: _ A S S Y

And we know it can't be any of the absent letters.

Based on the feedback, G is absent, but we have S at position 3 marked correct, so that position is now known.

So the secret word is actually of the form: [1] A S S Y

Now, we have to guess the first letter.

Possible candidates:
- BASSY? But we need a valid word.
- CASSY, MASSY, SASSY, etc.

But SASSY has S at position 1.

We can list words ending with ""ASSY"":
- CLASSY → 6 letters, too long.
- GLASSY → G is absent, but it starts with G? GLASSY: G L A S S Y → 6 letters? No, GLASS is 5 letters? GLASS: G L A S S → but that doesn't end with Y? Wait.

We need 5-letter words: ? A S S Y

So:
- BASSY: B A S S Y → B is possible? But BASSY is a word? It means bass-like or relating to bass, but it might be accepted.
- CASSY: C A S S Y → a name?
- MASSY: M A S S Y → meaning massive, solid; valid.
- SASSY: S A S S Y → valid.
- WASSY: not common.
- KASSY: not common, etc.

But we must use only allowed letters for position 1.

Given absent letters: R,I,E,T,N,P,L,G

For position 1, we can try B, M, S, etc. S is not absent yet, even though it appears elsewhere.

Possible guesses:
- ""MASSY"": M A S S Y
- ""BASSY"": B A S S Y
- ""SASSY"": S A S S Y

But note, in our pattern, the first letter is the only unknown.

We should choose a word that is valid and tests a possible first letter.

Since we have no constraints on duplicates, S could be at position 1.

Let's make a guess for position 1.

Try ""SASSY"": S A S S Y

If we are to guess this, we can confirm or deny S at position 1.

Similarly, ""MASSY"" tests M, ""BASSY"" tests B, etc.

But we have limited guesses: we are on guess 5 out of 6.

We can choose any.

I'll go with ""SASSY"" because S hasn't been tested at position 1. In previous guesses, we had S at position 4 and now position 3, but position 1 is new.

If we guess SASSY:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: A (known)
- Position 3: S (known now)
- Position 4: S (known)
- Position 5: Y (known)

The only uncertainty is whether S can be at position 1 or not.

If the secret word is SASSY, we win.

If not, we learn that S is absent or in the wrong position for position 1? But we know S is present at other positions, but it could be that there is no S at position 1, meaning the word has exactly two S's: at position 3 and 4. Since position 1 and 3 conflict? No, position 1 is a separate position.

If S is at position 1, and we have S at 3 and 4, that's fine.

But if the secret word is ""MASSY"", then S at position 1 in SASSY would be wrong.

So feedback would mark:
- Position 1: S could be x if not present at that position.

Then we can try M or B, etc.

But we can also guess ""MASSY"" directly.

Since we are guessing the complete word, we should pick one.

To be efficient, ""SASSY"" is common and worth trying.

Alternatively, note that from the feedback of Guess 4: GASSY had the S at position 3 marked correct, meaning that the secret word has S at position 3. Similarly, S at position 4 is correct. So the secret word has at least two S's (if the same S cannot be counted twice? But in Wordle, each S in the guess is compared to available S's in the secret).

But anyway, we now know positions 3 and 4 are S.

Therefore, the secret word must be ? A S S Y.

Now, what 5-letter words match this?

Valid words:
- BASSY (adjective: relating to bass, low sound)
- CASSY (rare, but sometimes a name)
- MASSY (meaning massive, heavy)
- SASSY (meaning lively, bold)
- WASSY (uncommon)

Given common usage, ""SASSY"" or ""MASSY"" are more likely.

We can try ""SASSY"" first.

But let's count the absent letters: R,I,E,T,N,P,L,G are absent.

So, if we guess ""SASSY"", and it's not the word, and S is not at position 1, we eliminate S for position 1, and then try another letter like B, M, etc.

With one guess left after this, we can guess correctly.

But ""SASSY"" uses S at position 1, which hasn't been eliminated.

So, I'll go with ""SASSY"".

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: 
     - R (absent), A (correct position 2), I (absent), S (correct position 4), E (absent).
     - Deduction: Word has A at position 2 and S at position 4.
   - **Guess 2 (TANSY)**: 
     - T (absent), A (correct position 2), N (absent), S (correct position 4), Y (correct position 5).
     - Deduction: Confirms A at position 2, S at position 4, and introduces Y at position 5. Absent letters: R, I, E, T, N.
     - Word pattern: `_ A _ S Y`.
   - **Guess 3 (PALSY)**: 
     - P (absent), A (correct position 2), L (absent), S (correct position 4), Y (correct position 5).
     - Deduction: Confirms positions 2, 4, and 5. Absent letters expand: R, I, E, T, N, P, L.
     - Word pattern remains `_ A _ S Y`, with unknown positions 1 and 3.
   - **Guess 4 (GASSY)**:
     - G (absent), A (correct position 2), S (correct position 3), S (correct position 4), Y (correct position 5).
     - Critical new info: Position 3 is S (marked ✓). This reveals the secret word has S at both positions 3 and 4.
     - Deduction: The word pattern is now `_ A S S Y`, with only position 1 unknown. Absent letters: R, I, E, T, N, P, L, G.

2. **Analyze Current Constraints**:
   - Secret word must match `_ A S S Y`.
   - Position 1 must be a letter not in the absent list: Cannot be R, I, E, T, N, P, L, or G.
   - Possible letters for position 1: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (etc.) but must form a valid English word.
   - Less common options: 
     - Words like ""WASSY"" or ""KASSY"" are rare/not standard, so prioritize common words.
   - Most probable valid words fitting the pattern:
     - **BASSY**: Meaning ""resembling bass"" (low frequency sound). Valid and common enough.
     - **MASSY**: Meaning ""massive, solid"". Valid and relatively common.
     - **SASSY**: Meaning ""lively, bold"". Very common, but ""S"" at position 1 may be redundant (not ruled out yet).
     - **CASSY/CASSY**: Rare/name, not ideal if common word list is assumed.

3. **Select Guess Strategy**:
   - Goal: Narrow down position 1 with a word that tests remaining possibilities efficiently.
   - ""BASSY"" introduces a new letter (B) for elimination if wrong, and is a valid 5-letter word.
   - ""MASSY"" tests M, but SASSY tests S at position 1 (which has overlap risk if S is triple, but feedback doesn't forbid this).
   - Based on the Wordle word list, ""SASSY"" is more common than BASSY/MASSY, but it uses S again. Given we have only 2 guesses left, prioritize testing a new letter.
   - **Chose ""BASSY""**: It tests B—a new letter—and fits the pattern perfectly. If wrong, feedback will confirm absence of B (or success), making position 1 solvable with the next guess.

4. **Decision**:
   - With `_ A S S Y` pattern and absent letters (R,I,E,T,N,P,L,G), ""BASSY"" is a sensible test for position 1 using B.
   - If incorrect, next guess (e.g., ""MASSY"" or ""SASSY"") will be required.

   - Based on the Wordle word list, ""SASSY"" is more common than BASSY/MASSY, but it uses S again. Given we have only 2 guesses left, prioritize testing a new letter.
   - **Chose ""BASSY""**: It tests B—a new letter—and fits the pattern perfectly. If wrong, feedback will confirm absence of B (or success), making position 1 solvable with the next guess.

4. **Decision**:
   - With `_ A S S Y` pattern and absent letters (R,I,E,T,N,P,L,G), ""BASSY"" is a sensible test for position 1 using B.
   - If incorrect, next guess (e.g., ""MASSY"" or ""SASSY"") will be required.",Guess 5: BASSSY -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.,FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 However, note that the example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we can choose any valid 5-letter word.

 Let me choose a word that has a set of common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 But note: the example secret word was ""BRISK"", so let's not base our choice on that.

 Alternatively, I can choose ""ROAST"" or ""SLATE"". However, I recall that ""RAISE"" is also a good starting word because it has three vowels and common consonants.

 Since we are at the first guess, any of these are acceptable.

 I'll choose: ""RAISE""

 Why?
 - It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
 - It covers a good set of letters.

 So, my first guess is ""RAISE"".I am starting the game and need to make my first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a word with common letters to maximize information. A good starting word typically includes frequent vowels and consonants. I'll use ""RAISE"" because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), covering a broad range of possibilities. This should help narrow down the secret word effectively.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so the second letter of the secret word is A)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so the fourth letter of the secret word is S)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter is A (position 2).
- The fourth letter is S (position 4).
- The letters R, I, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ A _ S _

We also know that the word does not contain R, I, E.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should try to use a word that:
- Has the second letter as A and the fourth letter as S (to confirm or get more information, but note we already know these are fixed, so we can use them to test other positions).
- Includes other common letters that haven't been tried yet (avoiding R, I, E).

Common letters we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to form a word that fits the pattern _ A _ S _ and uses new letters.

But note: our guess doesn't have to have A in the second and S in the fourth? Actually, we can, but we might also choose to test other positions. However, since we know A and S are in those positions, we can use them to help us find the other letters.

Let me think of words that have the form _ A _ S _ and do not contain R, I, E.

Some possibilities:
- TANS: but that's 4 letters, we need 5. So, TANSY? Not common. 
- We need 5-letter words.

Common words:
- TASKS: T A S K S -> but the fourth letter is K, not S? Wait, let's break down: 
  Position: 1: T, 2: A, 3: S, 4: K, 5: S -> that doesn't fit because we need S at the fourth position, but here the fourth is K and fifth is S. Also, we have S at the third and fifth, but we know the fourth is S, so that might be acceptable? Actually, the pattern is _ A _ S _, so:
  Position 1: any
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: any
  Position 4: S
  Position 5: any

So, TASKS: 
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: A -> good
- Position 3: S -> but we don't know about position 3, so that's okay
- Position 4: K -> but we need S at position 4? Wait, no: in TASKS, the fourth letter is K (if we count: 1:T, 2:A, 3:S, 4:K, 5:S). So the fourth letter is K, not S. So that doesn't match.

We need a word where the fourth letter is S. So the pattern is: 
Letter1: ?, Letter2: A, Letter3: ?, Letter4: S, Letter5: ?

Examples:
- CLASS: C L A S S -> but that's A at position 3, not 2. So no.
- PASTA: P A S T A -> but then position 3 is S, but we need position 4 to be S? 
  Let's break: 
  P (1), A (2), S (3), T (4), A (5) -> so position 4 is T, not S.

We need the fourth letter to be S. So:

- GAWKS: G A W K S -> position 4 is K, not S.
- BASTS: B A S T S -> position 4 is T? 
  B(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), S(5) -> position 4 is T.

I think I'm having trouble. Let me think of words ending with S? But we need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the fourth letter as S, meaning the last two letters are the fifth and the fourth is S? Not necessarily, because the fifth can be anything.

Actually, the word must have the structure: 
[letter1] A [letter3] S [letter5]

So, for example:
- MASTS: M A S T S -> 
  M(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), S(5) -> but position 4 is T, not S. We need position 4 to be S? 
  Wait, no: in MASTS, the letters are: 
  Position 1: M
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: S
  Position 4: T
  Position 5: S

That doesn't have S at position 4.

We need the fourth letter to be S. So the word must have the fourth character as S. 

For example:
- The word ""PASS"" is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

Let me think of 5-letter words with S at the fourth position and A at the second.

Examples:
- CAUSE: C A U S E -> 
  C(1), A(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E is already eliminated (from first feedback: E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.

- FEAST: F E A S T -> 
  F(1), E(2), A(3), S(4), T(5) -> but position 2 is E, not A. We need A at position 2.

We need A at position 2 and S at position 4.

So:
- Letter1: ?
- Letter2: A
- Letter3: ?
- Letter4: S
- Letter5: ?

And the word must not contain R, I, E.

Possible words:
- HASTY: H A S T Y -> 
  H(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but position 4 is T, not S. We need position 4 to be S, so the third letter is free, but the fourth must be S.

In HASTY, the fourth letter is T, not S.

I think I'm making a mistake. Let me clarify: the fourth letter must be S, so in the word, the character at index 3 (if we start counting at 0) or index 4? 

In the feedback, we count positions starting from 1.

For the word ""RAISE"":
- R is position 1
- A is position 2
- I is position 3
- S is position 4
- E is position 5

So, the feedback said A is correct at position 2 and S is correct at position 4.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 1: unknown, but not R (since R is not in the word)
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: unknown, but not I (since I is not in the word)
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: unknown, but not E

So the pattern is: [not R, not I, not E] A [not R, not I, not E] S [not R, not I, not E]

Now, we need to find a word that fits: _ A _ S _

And we must avoid the letters R, I, E.

Let me list some words that fit this pattern:

- TALKS: T A L K S -> 
  Position 1: T, 2: A, 3: L, 4: K, 5: S -> but position 4 is K, not S. We need position 4 to be S.

- We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the fourth character as S.

Examples of words with second letter A and fourth letter S:

- GAZES: but has E and Z? And E is eliminated.
- JAZZY: J A Z Z Y -> position 4 is Z, not S.
- I'm struggling. Let me think of common words.

Another idea: ""BASIS"" -> B A S I S -> 
  B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5) -> but position 4 is I, not S. And I is eliminated.

""CASKS"": C A S K S -> 
  C(1), A(2), S(3), K(4), S(5) -> position 4 is K.

""PASSE"": P A S S E -> 
  P(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E is eliminated.

""MASSE"": same issue with E.

""WASPS"": W A S P S -> 
  W(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), S(5) -> position 4 is P.

I need to look for words where the fourth letter is S. That means the word has the structure: ??A?S? but with the fourth letter being the fourth character.

Actually, the fourth character is the one at index 3 (if we index from 0). So in a 5-letter word, the positions are:
Index 0: first letter
Index 1: second letter
Index 2: third letter
Index 3: fourth letter
Index 4: fifth letter

We need:
Index 1: A
Index 3: S

So, the word: [0] A [2] S [4]

And [0], [2], [4] cannot be R, I, E, and also not the letters we know are absent.

Now, let me think of words:

- ""HASTE"": H A S T E -> 
  [0]:H, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> but [3] is T, not S. And we need [3] to be S.

I think I found one: ""CAUSE"" has [3] as S? 
C A U S E: 
[0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:U, [3]:S, [4]:E -> yes, but [4] is E which is eliminated.

- ""PAUSE"": same issue.

- ""TASTE"": T A S T E -> 
  [0]:T, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> [3] is T, not S.

- ""BASTE"": same as TASTE.

- ""PASTE"": P A S T E -> 
  [0]:P, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> [3] is T.

I need to find a word where the fourth letter (index 3) is S.

For example:
- ""GASPS"": G A S P S -> 
  [0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:P, [4]:S -> [3] is P.

- ""CLASS"": C L A S S -> 
  [0]:C, [1]:L, [2]:A, [3]:S, [4]:S -> but [1] is L, not A. We need [1] to be A.

We need [1] to be A and [3] to be S.

So, the word must have:
- The second letter (index 1) is A.
- The fourth letter (index 3) is S.

So, the structure: 
Letter0: ?
Letter1: A
Letter2: ?
Letter3: S
Letter4: ?

And the word must not contain R, I, E.

Let me search my vocabulary:

- ""DAISY"": D A I S Y -> 
  [0]:D, [1]:A, [2]:I, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> but I is eliminated (from first feedback: I is not in the word). So we cannot use I.

- ""HASTY"": H A S T Y -> 
  [0]:H, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:Y -> [3] is T, not S.

- ""NASTY"": N A S T Y -> same, [3] is T.

- ""PASTY"": P A S T Y -> same.

- ""TANSY"": T A N S Y -> 
  [0]:T, [1]:A, [2]:N, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> yes! [3] is S.

So, ""TANSY"" is a word? It means a type of plant. But is it common? In Wordle, the word list might include it.

But let's check the letters: T, A, N, S, Y. 
- T: not eliminated
- A: we know is in
- N: new
- S: we know is in
- Y: new

And it doesn't contain R, I, E.

So, ""TANSY"" fits the pattern and uses new letters.

Another word: ""MANGO"" doesn't have S at position 4.

""BASSO"" is not common.

""CASAS"": C A S A S -> 
  [0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:A, [4]:S -> [3] is A, not S.

""LASSI"": L A S S I -> 
  [0]:L, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:I -> [3] is S, but [4] is I which is eliminated.

""PASHA"": P A S H A -> 
  [0]:P, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:H, [4]:A -> [3] is H.

I think ""TANSY"" is a candidate.

Another one: ""JASPS"" is not common.

Or ""VASAL"", but [3] is A.

Perhaps ""TAWSE"", but has E.

I think ""TANSY"" is acceptable.

But note: we are allowed to guess any valid 5-letter word, not necessarily one that fits the known positions. However, it's efficient to use the known positions to test other letters.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that doesn't have A in position 2 and S in position 4, but that would waste the known information. It's better to use them to get more information about the other positions.

So, I'll go with ""TANSY"".

But let me confirm: TANSY is a valid word? Yes, it's in the dictionary.

So, guess: TANSY

We hope to get feedback that tells us about T, N, Y and also confirms A and S (which we already know).

But note: we know A and S are in the word, but in TANSY, A is at position 2 and S is at position 4, which are the correct positions? We know they are correct, so we expect them to be marked as correct.

However, the feedback might show:
- T: ? 
- A: should be ✓
- N: ?
- S: should be ✓
- Y: ?

But the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but in this case, TANSY has unique letters.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that has different letters to test more.

But with the constraints, TANSY is a good choice.

Another common word: ""PASTA"" doesn't fit because [3] is T.

Or ""MASTA"" not a word.

I think TANSY is fine.

But let me think of a more common word: ""HASTY"" doesn't have S at [3].

What about ""BASES"": B A S E S -> 
  [0]:B, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:E, [4]:S -> [3] is E, eliminated.

""CASES"": same.

""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> 
  [0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> [3] is S! Yes.

So, ""GASSY"" is a word. It means containing gas or gaseous.

Letters: G, A, S, S, Y. 
- G: new
- A: known
- S: known (but we have two S's)
- Y: new

But note: the feedback for the first guess said S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4). It didn't say anything about multiple S's. So there could be multiple S's.

In ""GASSY"", we have S at position 2 and 3? 
[0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:Y

So position 4 is [3] which is S, so that matches. And position 2 is A, which matches.

But we have an extra S at position 2? [2] is S.

The secret word might have an S at position 3? We don't know.

But in our first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was correct. We didn't have S at position 3 in the first guess (we had I at position 3). So we don't know about position 3.

So ""GASSY"" is also a candidate.

But ""GASSY"" has two S's. It might be a good test because if the secret word has only one S, then one of the S's in GASSY might be marked as wrong position or not present? But we know position 4 must be S, so the S at position 3 in GASSY might be additional.

But to avoid complexity, maybe a word with unique letters is better. TANSY has unique letters.

However, TANSY is less common. Let me see if there's a more common word.

Another word: ""PAYSA"" not a word.

""TASSA"" not common.

""CANST"": C A N S T -> 
  [0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:N, [3]:S, [4]:T -> yes! [3] is S.

""CANST"" is an archaic word for can or container, but might be in the word list.

""HASTY"" doesn't work.

""NASTY"" doesn't work.

""PASTY"" doesn't work.

""RASTA"" has R, which is eliminated.

I think ""TANSY"" or ""GASSY"" or ""CANST"" are options.

But ""GASSY"" is in the Wordle word list, I believe.

To maximize new letters, TANSY has T, N, Y which are new.

GASSY has G and Y, but S is repeated.

Since we have limited guesses, I'd prefer to test more new letters.

So, I'll go with ""TANSY"".

But let me check: in the first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was correct. In TANSY, we are putting S at position 4 again, which is safe because we know it's correct. And A at position 2 is also correct.

The new letters are T at 1, N at 3, Y at 5.

So, after this guess, we will know about T, N, Y.

Therefore, I choose ""TANSY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, I, and E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the correct position (position 2).
- S is in the correct position (position 4).

The secret word must have the form: _ A _ S _, and it cannot contain R, I, or E. For the second guess, I chose ""TANSY"" because:
- It fits the known pattern (A at position 2, S at position 4).
- It introduces new common letters (T, N, Y) that haven't been tested yet.
- It avoids the eliminated letters (R, I, E).

This guess will help test the presence of T, N, and Y, and confirm the positions of A and S.

<guess>TANSY</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: TANSY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) N(x) S(✓) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so position 2 is A)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so position 4 is S)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: TANSY
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, position 2 is A, confirmed again)
- N: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, position 4 is S, confirmed again)
- Y: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so position 5 is Y)

So, from the feedback, we now know:
- The secret word has the second letter A, fourth letter S, and fifth letter Y. So the pattern is: _ A _ S Y
- We also know that the letters R, I, E, T, N are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter1] A [letter3] S Y

And we need to find letter1 and letter3, which cannot be R, I, E, T, N, and also not any other eliminated letters. Currently, eliminated letters are: R, I, E, T, N.

We have two positions to guess: position 1 and position 3.

We need to make a third guess. We should choose a word that fits the pattern and uses new letters to test for position 1 and 3.

The pattern: [1] A [3] S Y

We know position 1 and 3 must be filled with letters not in the eliminated set.

Common letters that haven't been tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (but note, we have to form a valid word).

We need to find a word that has the form: [1] A [3] S Y

Let's think of possible words:

- DAISY: but D A I S Y -> I is eliminated, so not allowed.
- HAWKS: H A W K S -> but the last letter is S, not Y, and we need Y at the end. Also, the pattern requires S at position 4 and Y at 5, so HAWKS ends with KS, not SY.
- We need the word to end with ""SY"".

So, the last three letters are A (at 2), then S (at 4), and Y (at 5). But note: position 3 is between A and S, so the word has: letter1, then A, then letter3, then S, then Y.

So the word is: [1]A[3]SY

Examples:
- DAISY: D A I S Y -> but I is eliminated.
- PANSY: P A N S Y -> but N is eliminated (from guess 2, N is not in the word).
- MOSSY: M O S S Y -> but position 2 is O, not A.
- JAZZY: J A Z Z Y -> but then position 3 is Z, position 4 is Z, not S. We need position 4 to be S.

We need position 4 to be S, so the word must have S at the fourth position and Y at the fifth.

So, the third letter (position 3) is before the S, so the word has: [1] A [3] S Y

Possible words:
- ""HASPY"" - not a common word.
- ""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> but then position 3 is S, and position 4 is S. So the word is G A S S Y. 
  - This has S at position 3 and S at position 4. But we know position 4 is S, so that's fine. However, in this case, position 3 is also S. But we don't know if the word has two S's or not.

But in ""GASSY"", the pattern is:
  Position 1: G
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: S
  Position 4: S
  Position 5: Y

But we know position 4 is S, so if we guess GASSY, then:
- Position 2: A is correct (we know)
- Position 4: S is correct (we know)
- Position 5: Y is correct (we know from guess 2)

But we are testing position 1 (G) and position 3 (S). However, if the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 3 might be marked as absent or wrong position? But we know position 4 has S, so if there is only one S, then the S at position 3 would be extra and might be marked as not present? But actually, in Wordle, if there is only one S and it is at position 4, then the S at position 3 would be marked as absent (x) because the single S is already used at position 4.

But in our case, we know position 4 is S, so if the secret word has another S, then it might be possible.

Alternatively, we can avoid using S at position 3 to not complicate.

But let's list possible words ending with ""SY"" and having A at position 2.

The only common word I can think of is ""DANDY"" but that doesn't have S.

Another one: ""LASSY"" - but L A S S Y, same as GASSY.

Or ""MASSY"": M A S S Y.

But these all have S at position 3.

What about ""PALSY"": P A L S Y -> 
  Position 1: P
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: L
  Position 4: S
  Position 5: Y

Yes! This fits perfectly: P A L S Y.

And L is a new letter, not eliminated.

Similarly, ""BALSY"" - not a word.

""JALSY"" - not a word.

""WALSY"" - not common.

So ""PALSY"" is a valid word, meaning a condition.

Another one: ""HALSY"" - not common.

""GAYLY"" - G A Y L Y -> but position 3 is Y, and position 5 is Y, but we need position 4 to be S, which it's not.

So, ""PALSY"" seems a good candidate.

Another possibility: ""FANCY"" but no S.

We need the fourth letter to be S, so it must be ...S at the end, but with Y at the end, so ...SY.

So, the only common words I can think of are those with double S like GASSY, MASSY, or PALSY.

But PALSY has L at position 3.

Also, ""DAISY"" is out because of I.

So, I think ""PALSY"" is a good guess.

We can also consider ""HASTY"", but H A S T Y -> position 4 is T, not S. We need position 4 to be S.

No, we know position 4 is S, so we must have S at position 4.

So, let's go with ""PALSY"".

In ""PALSY"":
- P: new letter
- A: known correct
- L: new letter
- S: known correct
- Y: known correct

We are testing P and L.

If the secret word is ""PALSY"", then we win.

Otherwise, we get feedback on P and L.

But note: we have only two positions unknown, so we might solve it in this guess or the next.

Another word: ""JAZZY"" doesn't have S.

Or ""BUSKY"" not common.

I think ""PALSY"" is acceptable.

But let me confirm if there are other options.

""CASKY"" not a word.

""BASSO"" doesn't end with Y.

We know the word ends with Y, because position 5 is Y.

So, the word must end with SY.

Other words: ""MOSSY"" has O at position 2, not A.

""FUSSY"" has U at position 2.

So, ""PALSY"" seems the best.

We could guess a word that doesn't have A, S, Y in their positions to test more letters, but that would be inefficient because we know those positions are fixed. It's better to use the known positions to focus on the unknown ones.

So, I'll go with ""PALSY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: A is correct and in position 2, S is correct and in position 4. R, I, and E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (TANSY)**: A (position 2), S (position 4), and Y (position 5) are correct. T and N are absent.

The secret word must have the pattern: `_ A _ S Y`, with positions 2, 4, and 5 confirmed. Absent letters are R, I, E, T, and N.

For the third guess, I chose **PALSY** because:
- It fits the known pattern (A at position 2, S at position 4, Y at position 5).
- It tests new common letters (P and L) for the unknown positions (1 and 3).
- It avoids all eliminated letters (R, I, E, T, N).

This guess will help identify if P or L is in the word and their positions, bringing us closer to solving the puzzle.

<guess>PALSY</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: TANSY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) N(x) S(✓) Y(✓)
Guess 3: PALSY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) L(x) S(✓) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: absent (x)
- A: correct position (✓) at position 2
- I: absent (x)
- S: correct position (✓) at position 4
- E: absent (x)

Guess 2: TANSY
- T: absent (x)
- A: correct position (✓) at position 2
- N: absent (x)
- S: correct position (✓) at position 4
- Y: correct position (✓) at position 5

Guess 3: PALSY
- P: absent (x)
- A: correct position (✓) at position 2
- L: absent (x)
- S: correct position (✓) at position 4
- Y: correct position (✓) at position 5

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ A _ S Y
- Confirmed letters in position: 
  - Position 2: A
  - Position 4: S
  - Position 5: Y
- Absent letters: R, I, E, T, N, P, L

We need to find the first and third letters. The first letter (position 1) and the third letter (position 3) must be letters that are not in the absent list and form a valid English word.

The absent letters so far: R, I, E, T, N, P, L.

Possible letters for position 1 and 3: any letter not in {R, I, E, T, N, P, L}. This includes: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note that Y is already used at the end, and A is at position 2, so they might be repeated? We don't have information about duplicates yet.

However, in the pattern _ A _ S Y, the A and S are fixed, and Y is fixed. The first and third positions are open.

We need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but so far, we haven't encountered any duplicates in the feedback. For example, in PALSY, we had S at position 4, but we don't know if S can appear again. Similarly, A and Y might be duplicated.

But to be safe, we should consider both possibilities.

Now, let's think of words that fit the pattern _ A _ S Y.

Possible words:
- We already tried PALSY, which didn't work because P and L are absent.
- Other possibilities: 
  - DAISY: but I is absent, so invalid.
  - MAISY: M A I S Y -> I is absent, invalid.
  - BAISY: not a word? Or B A I S Y, but I absent.
  - GAWSY: not common, and W might be possible? But let's check.

Actually, common words:
- ""HASPY"" - not a common word.
- ""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> but we have S at position 3 and 4. However, in this case, position 3 is S, which we haven't tested directly. But note, in the pattern, position 3 is the third letter, which in GASSY is S. But we know position 4 is S, so if we guess GASSY, we are testing if there is an S at position 3 as well.

But we have to consider the feedback: if the secret word has only one S (at position 4), then the S at position 3 in GASSY would be marked as absent? Or if it's present but in the wrong position? But since position 4 is already S, and if there is no other S, then the S at position 3 should be absent.

But in our case, we know S is at position 4, so we can have a word with two S's.

Similarly, ""MASSY"": M A S S Y.

But let's list valid words that fit _ A _ S Y and don't use absent letters.

The third letter (position 3) must be a letter not absent, and not conflicting.

Possible candidates:
- ""CASKY"" - not a word.
- ""DASHY"": D A S H Y -> but position 3 is S? No: D A S H Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:A, 3:S, 4:H, 5:Y -> but we need position 4 to be S, so this has H at position 4, not S. So invalid pattern.

We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the third letter and then S at fourth.

So the pattern is: [1] A [3] S Y

So the third letter is at position 3, then S at 4.

So, for example:
- ""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> positions: 1:G, 2:A, 3:S, 4:S, 5:Y -> so position 3 is S, position 4 is S.
- ""MASSY"": M A S S Y -> same.
- ""BASSY"": B A S S Y -> same.

But also:
- ""PASSY"" - not common, but similar.

But we have ""PALSY"" which we tried, with L at position 3.

Another word: ""WASPY"": W A S P Y -> positions: 1:W, 2:A, 3:S, 4:P, 5:Y -> but position 4 is P, not S. So invalid.

We need position 4 to be S, so the word must have S at position 4. Therefore, the letter at position 3 can be anything, but the next is S.

So, the only way to have S at position 4 is if the word has ...AS Y, but with a letter in between.

Actually, the word is: letter1, A, letter3, S, Y.

So, for ""GASSY"": letter3 is S, so it's A followed by S (at position 3), then S again at 4? No:

In ""GASSY"":
- Position 1: G
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: Y

So, position 3 is S, position 4 is S. So the pattern is satisfied because position 4 is S.

Similarly, in ""PALSY"", position 3 is L, position 4 is S.

Now, we have eliminated P and L for position 1 and 3 in the last guess.

So, for position 1, we cannot use P, and for position 3, we cannot use L.

Also, we cannot use R,I,E,T,N.

So, what are possible words?

- ""GASSY"": G at position 1, S at position 3. But we haven't tested G or the double S.
- ""BASSY"": B at 1, S at 3.
- ""MASSY"": M at 1, S at 3.
- ""CASSY"": C at 1, S at 3. But ""CASSY"" might be a name, but let's consider if it's valid.
- ""DASSY"": not common.
- ""FASSY"": not common.
- ""HASSY"": not common.
- ""JASSY"": not common.
- ""KASSY"": not common.
- ""SASSY"": S A S S Y -> but position 1 is S, and we have S at position 4. But we don't know if S can be at position 1. Also, we have not tested S at position 1.

""SASSY"": 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: Y

This has three S's. But we know position 4 is S, so it's possible.

But we haven't tested S at position 1 or 3.

Now, we need to choose a guess that tests new letters.

But we have only two positions to guess, and we can try a word that uses new letters for position 1 and 3.

Possible new letters for position 1: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (avoiding R,I,E,T,N,P,L)

For position 3: same, but note that if we use a word with S at position 3, that might be efficient if we think there is a double S.

But we don't have evidence of double S yet.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use S at position 3 to test a different letter.

For example, what other letters can be at position 3?

In ""PALSY"" we tried L, which was absent. So position 3 cannot be L.

What about other letters? For example, ""DAISY"" is out because of I.

""MAYBE"" doesn't have S.

Another word: ""HABIT"" doesn't fit.

Let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and use allowed letters.

Possible words:
- With no double S: 
  - ""WASPY"" - but position 4 is P, not S. No.
  - ""JAZZY"" - no S.
  - ""FAWNY"" - no S.
  - ""CABBY"" - no S.

I think the only common words with the pattern _ A _ S Y are those with double S or PALSY (which we tried).

But PALSY didn't work.

So, perhaps the word has double S.

Let me think: ""GASSY"", ""BASSY"", ""SASSY"", ""MASSY"", etc.

We can try ""GASSY"" to test.

But we have to make a guess.

Another possibility: ""DASHY"" is D A S H Y, but that has S at position 3 and H at 4, not S at 4. So it doesn't fit the pattern.

We need position 4 to be S, so the only way is to have the third letter and then S, so if the third letter is not S, then the word must have a letter at 3 and then S at 4.

For example, ""PALSY"" has L at 3 and S at 4.

Similarly, what about ""BALSY""? Not a word.

""FALSY"" - not common, but in programming, but might not be in word list.

""JASPY"" - not common.

I think we are left with the double S words.

So, let's try ""GASSY"".

In ""GASSY"", we have:
- G at position 1: new letter
- A at 2: known
- S at 3: we are testing if S is present and if it can be at position 3
- S at 4: known
- Y at 5: known

If the secret word is ""GASSY"", we win.

If not, we might get feedback that G is absent or the S at position 3 is not correct (if there is no second S).

But if the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 3 in GASSY would be marked as absent, even though S is in the word, because the only S is at position 4 and is already used.

So, the feedback would show:
- G: ? 
- A: ✓
- S: might be x (if no second S) or ✓ (if there is second S at position 3)
- S: ✓ (because position 4 is S)
- Y: ✓

But the first S (position 3) would be marked as absent if there is no second S.

Alternatively, if the word is ""SASSY"", then position 1 is S, which we haven't tested.

But we don't know if S can be at position 1.

To be systematic, let's choose a word that uses a new letter for position 1 and a new letter for position 3, but if we avoid S at position 3, what are the options?

For example, is there a word like ""BABY"" but 5 letters? No.

""JAGSY"" not a word.

""QUASY"" not a word.

I think the only practical choices are the double S words or perhaps we missed a word.

Another word: ""HASTY"" but position 4 is T, not S.

""PASTY"" same.

""NASTY"" same.

""TASTY"" same.

""RASPY"" has R, which is absent.

""GASPY"" not common.

""WASHY"" W A S H Y -> position 4 is H, not S.

So, I think we have to go with a double S word.

Let's choose ""SASSY"" because it also tests S at position 1.

But position 1 is S, which we haven't tested as absent, but we know S is in the word at position 4, so it could be at position 1 as well.

So, ""SASSY"" has S at position 1, A at 2, S at 3, S at 4, Y at 5.

If we guess ""SASSY"", and the secret word is ""GASSY"", then:
- Position 1: S vs G, so S would be marked as absent? But S is in the word at position 4, so if there is only one S, then S at position 1 and 3 would be marked as absent or wrong position? 

This might be messy.

Perhaps ""GASSY"" is a safer guess because it uses a new letter G.

Let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and allowed letters:

- GASSY: G at 1, S at 3
- BASSY: B at 1, S at 3
- CASSY: C at 1, S at 3 (CASSY is a name, but might be accepted)
- MASSY: M at 1, S at 3
- SASSY: S at 1, S at 3
- etc.

We can try ""BASIS"" but doesn't end with Y.

Given that, I'll go with ""GASSY"" as the next guess.

But we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that tests two new letters without S at position 3.

For example, is there a word like ""DADDY"" but no S.

Or ""FADDY"" not a word.

""JUDGY"" not.

I think it's hard, so I'll go with ""GASSY"".

So, guess: GASSY

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If the secret word is ""GASSY"", we win.

If not, and if G is absent, then we know position 1 is not G, and the S at position 3 might be absent (if no second S), then we know position 3 is not S, and we can try other letters.

But if position 3 is not S, then what other letter can it be? We have no other common words.

Unless we missed a word.

Another word: ""DALLY"" but no S.

""GALLY"" not.

""PALLY"" has P and L, which are absent.

I think we have to try.

Perhaps ""HAPPY"" but no S.

I think ""GASSY"" is the best bet.

So, I'll go with that.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: 
     - R (absent), A (correct position 2), I (absent), S (correct position 4), E (absent).
   - **Guess 2 (TANSY)**:
     - T (absent), A (correct position 2), N (absent), S (correct position 4), Y (correct position 5).
   - **Guess 3 (PALSY)**:
     - P (absent), A (correct position 2), L (absent), S (correct position 4), Y (correct position 5).

2. **Deductions from Feedback**:
   - The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ A _ S Y` (positions: 2=A, 4=S, 5=Y).
   - Confirmed absent letters: **R, I, E, T, N, P, L** (from all guesses).
   - Unknown positions: **1 and 3** need to be filled with letters not in the absent list.
   - Possible letters for positions 1 and 3: Any letter not in {R, I, E, T, N, P, L}, such as B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. Note that A, S, and Y are confirmed but could potentially repeat (though no evidence yet).

3. **Evaluate Possible Words**:
   - The pattern `_ A _ S Y` limits options. Common words fitting this pattern include:
     - **GASSY**: G at position 1, S at position 3.
     - **BASSY**: B at position 1, S at position 3.
     - **MASSY**: M at position 1, S at position 3.
     - **SASSY**: S at position 1, S at position 3.
   - Words like DAISY or PALSY are invalid (contain absent letters I or L/P).
   - Since position 3 could be S (allowing double S), testing a word with S at position 3 is efficient. It tests if a second S exists and uses new letters for position 1.
   - **Why choose GASSY?** 
     - It tests a new letter (G) for position 1 and S for position 3.
     - If G is correct, we solve position 1. If not, we eliminate G.
     - The S at position 3 tests for a potential double S (if present, it confirms; if absent, it rules out S for position 3).
     - GASSY is a valid English word (meaning ""resembling or full of gas""), avoiding absent letters.

4. **Strategy**:
   - With only positions 1 and 3 unknown, GASSY maximizes information by testing a new consonant (G) and the double-S possibility.
   - If GASSY is incorrect, feedback on G and the position 3 S will narrow options further (e.g., if S at position 3 is absent, we eliminate double S and focus on other letters for position 3 like B, M, etc.).

<guess>GASSY</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: TANSY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) N(x) S(✓) Y(✓)
Guess 3: PALSY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) L(x) S(✓) Y(✓)
Guess 4: GASSY -> FEEDBACK: G(x) A(✓) S(✓) S(✓) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE → R(x), A(✓ position 2), I(x), S(✓ position 4), E(x)
Guess 2: TANSY → T(x), A(✓ position 2), N(x), S(✓ position 4), Y(✓ position 5)
Guess 3: PALSY → P(x), A(✓ position 2), L(x), S(✓ position 4), Y(✓ position 5)
Guess 4: GASSY → G(x), A(✓ position 2), S(✓), S(✓), Y(✓)

For Guess 4: GASSY
- The word is G A S S Y
- Feedback: G(x), A(✓), S(✓), S(✓), Y(✓)

Breakdown:
- Position 1: G → marked (x) → absent
- Position 2: A → marked (✓) → correct (as we know)
- Position 3: S → marked (✓) → this means the S at position 3 is in the word and in the correct position? But we already knew S is at position 4. This suggests that there is an additional S at position 3.
- Position 4: S → marked (✓) → correct (as we know)
- Position 5: Y → marked (✓) → correct (as we know)

The feedback for S at position 3 being (✓) means:
- The letter S is present and correctly placed at position 3.
- But position 3 is the third position, which we didn't know before.

However, this adds new information: we now know that position 3 must be S because it's marked as correct.

But let's recall:
The secret word has:
- Position 2: A
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: Y

And now from Guess 4, we have:
- Position 3: S is marked correct → so the secret word has S at position 3.

Therefore, the secret word must be: _ A S S Y

Because:
- Position 3 is S (from this feedback)
- Position 4 is S (already known)

So the secret word is: [letter1] A S S Y

And we know position 1 is not G (since G is absent).

Also, from previous feedbacks, we have absent letters: R, I, E, T, N, P, L, and now G.

So position 1 cannot be any of R,I,E,T,N,P,L,G.

The pattern is: [1] A S S Y

We need to find position 1, which must be a letter not in the absent set.

The secret word is fixed except the first letter: _ A S S Y

And we know it can't be any of the absent letters.

Based on the feedback, G is absent, but we have S at position 3 marked correct, so that position is now known.

So the secret word is actually of the form: [1] A S S Y

Now, we have to guess the first letter.

Possible candidates:
- BASSY? But we need a valid word.
- CASSY, MASSY, SASSY, etc.

But SASSY has S at position 1.

We can list words ending with ""ASSY"":
- CLASSY → 6 letters, too long.
- GLASSY → G is absent, but it starts with G? GLASSY: G L A S S Y → 6 letters? No, GLASS is 5 letters? GLASS: G L A S S → but that doesn't end with Y? Wait.

We need 5-letter words: ? A S S Y

So:
- BASSY: B A S S Y → B is possible? But BASSY is a word? It means bass-like or relating to bass, but it might be accepted.
- CASSY: C A S S Y → a name?
- MASSY: M A S S Y → meaning massive, solid; valid.
- SASSY: S A S S Y → valid.
- WASSY: not common.
- KASSY: not common, etc.

But we must use only allowed letters for position 1.

Given absent letters: R,I,E,T,N,P,L,G

For position 1, we can try B, M, S, etc. S is not absent yet, even though it appears elsewhere.

Possible guesses:
- ""MASSY"": M A S S Y
- ""BASSY"": B A S S Y
- ""SASSY"": S A S S Y

But note, in our pattern, the first letter is the only unknown.

We should choose a word that is valid and tests a possible first letter.

Since we have no constraints on duplicates, S could be at position 1.

Let's make a guess for position 1.

Try ""SASSY"": S A S S Y

If we are to guess this, we can confirm or deny S at position 1.

Similarly, ""MASSY"" tests M, ""BASSY"" tests B, etc.

But we have limited guesses: we are on guess 5 out of 6.

We can choose any.

I'll go with ""SASSY"" because S hasn't been tested at position 1. In previous guesses, we had S at position 4 and now position 3, but position 1 is new.

If we guess SASSY:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: A (known)
- Position 3: S (known now)
- Position 4: S (known)
- Position 5: Y (known)

The only uncertainty is whether S can be at position 1 or not.

If the secret word is SASSY, we win.

If not, we learn that S is absent or in the wrong position for position 1? But we know S is present at other positions, but it could be that there is no S at position 1, meaning the word has exactly two S's: at position 3 and 4. Since position 1 and 3 conflict? No, position 1 is a separate position.

If S is at position 1, and we have S at 3 and 4, that's fine.

But if the secret word is ""MASSY"", then S at position 1 in SASSY would be wrong.

So feedback would mark:
- Position 1: S could be x if not present at that position.

Then we can try M or B, etc.

But we can also guess ""MASSY"" directly.

Since we are guessing the complete word, we should pick one.

To be efficient, ""SASSY"" is common and worth trying.

Alternatively, note that from the feedback of Guess 4: GASSY had the S at position 3 marked correct, meaning that the secret word has S at position 3. Similarly, S at position 4 is correct. So the secret word has at least two S's (if the same S cannot be counted twice? But in Wordle, each S in the guess is compared to available S's in the secret).

But anyway, we now know positions 3 and 4 are S.

Therefore, the secret word must be ? A S S Y.

Now, what 5-letter words match this?

Valid words:
- BASSY (adjective: relating to bass, low sound)
- CASSY (rare, but sometimes a name)
- MASSY (meaning massive, heavy)
- SASSY (meaning lively, bold)
- WASSY (uncommon)

Given common usage, ""SASSY"" or ""MASSY"" are more likely.

We can try ""SASSY"" first.

But let's count the absent letters: R,I,E,T,N,P,L,G are absent.

So, if we guess ""SASSY"", and it's not the word, and S is not at position 1, we eliminate S for position 1, and then try another letter like B, M, etc.

With one guess left after this, we can guess correctly.

But ""SASSY"" uses S at position 1, which hasn't been eliminated.

So, I'll go with ""SASSY"".### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: 
     - R (absent), A (correct position 2), I (absent), S (correct position 4), E (absent).
     - Deduction: Word has A at position 2 and S at position 4.
   - **Guess 2 (TANSY)**: 
     - T (absent), A (correct position 2), N (absent), S (correct position 4), Y (correct position 5).
     - Deduction: Confirms A at position 2, S at position 4, and introduces Y at position 5. Absent letters: R, I, E, T, N.
     - Word pattern: `_ A _ S Y`.
   - **Guess 3 (PALSY)**: 
     - P (absent), A (correct position 2), L (absent), S (correct position 4), Y (correct position 5).
     - Deduction: Confirms positions 2, 4, and 5. Absent letters expand: R, I, E, T, N, P, L.
     - Word pattern remains `_ A _ S Y`, with unknown positions 1 and 3.
   - **Guess 4 (GASSY)**:
     - G (absent), A (correct position 2), S (correct position 3), S (correct position 4), Y (correct position 5).
     - Critical new info: Position 3 is S (marked ✓). This reveals the secret word has S at both positions 3 and 4.
     - Deduction: The word pattern is now `_ A S S Y`, with only position 1 unknown. Absent letters: R, I, E, T, N, P, L, G.

2. **Analyze Current Constraints**:
   - Secret word must match `_ A S S Y`.
   - Position 1 must be a letter not in the absent list: Cannot be R, I, E, T, N, P, L, or G.
   - Possible letters for position 1: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (etc.) but must form a valid English word.
   - Less common options: 
     - Words like ""WASSY"" or ""KASSY"" are rare/not standard, so prioritize common words.
   - Most probable valid words fitting the pattern:
     - **BASSY**: Meaning ""resembling bass"" (low frequency sound). Valid and common enough.
     - **MASSY**: Meaning ""massive, solid"". Valid and relatively common.
     - **SASSY**: Meaning ""lively, bold"". Very common, but ""S"" at position 1 may be redundant (not ruled out yet).
     - **CASSY/CASSY**: Rare/name, not ideal if common word list is assumed.

3. **Select Guess Strategy**:
   - Goal: Narrow down position 1 with a word that tests remaining possibilities efficiently.
   - ""BASSY"" introduces a new letter (B) for elimination if wrong, and is a valid 5-letter word.
   - ""MASSY"" tests M, but SASSY tests S at position 1 (which has overlap risk if S is triple, but feedback doesn't forbid this).
   - Based on the Wordle word list, ""SASSY"" is more common than BASSY/MASSY, but it uses S again. Given we have only 2 guesses left, prioritize testing a new letter.
   - **Chose ""BASSY""**: It tests B—a new letter—and fits the pattern perfectly. If wrong, feedback will confirm absence of B (or success), making position 1 solvable with the next guess.

4. **Decision**:
   - With `_ A S S Y` pattern and absent letters (R,I,E,T,N,P,L,G), ""BASSY"" is a sensible test for position 1 using B.
   - If incorrect, next guess (e.g., ""MASSY"" or ""SASSY"") will be required.

Since there\'s no prior feedback, I should choose a word with common letters to maximize information. A good starting word typically includes frequent vowels and consonants. I\'ll use ""RAISE"" because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), covering a broad range of possibilities. This should help narrow down the secret word effectively.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so the second letter of the secret word is A)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- S: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so the fourth letter of the secret word is S)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The second letter is A (position 2).\n- The fourth letter is S (position 4).\n- The letters R, I, E are not in the word at all.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has the form: _ A _ S _\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain R, I, E.\n\nNow, we need to make a second guess. We should try to use a word that:\n- Has the second letter as A and the fourth letter as S (to confirm or get more information, but note we already know these are fixed, so we can use them to test other positions).\n- Includes other common letters that haven\'t been tried yet (avoiding R, I, E).\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\nWe can try to form a word that fits the pattern _ A _ S _ and uses new letters.\n\nBut note: our guess doesn\'t have to have A in the second and S in the fourth? Actually, we can, but we might also choose to test other positions. However, since we know A and S are in those positions, we can use them to help us find the other letters.\n\nLet me think of words that have the form _ A _ S _ and do not contain R, I, E.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- TANS: but that\'s 4 letters, we need 5. So, TANSY? Not common. \n- We need 5-letter words.\n\nCommon words:\n- TASKS: T A S K S -> but the fourth letter is K, not S? Wait, let\'s break down: \n  Position: 1: T, 2: A, 3: S, 4: K, 5: S -> that doesn\'t fit because we need S at the fourth position, but here the fourth is K and fifth is S. Also, we have S at the third and fifth, but we know the fourth is S, so that might be acceptable? Actually, the pattern is _ A _ S _, so:\n  Position 1: any\n  Position 2: A\n  Position 3: any\n  Position 4: S\n  Position 5: any\n\nSo, TASKS: \n- Position 1: T\n- Position 2: A -> good\n- Position 3: S -> but we don\'t know about position 3, so that\'s okay\n- Position 4: K -> but we need S at position 4? Wait, no: in TASKS, the fourth letter is K (if we count: 1:T, 2:A, 3:S, 4:K, 5:S). So the fourth letter is K, not S. So that doesn\'t match.\n\nWe need a word where the fourth letter is S. So the pattern is: \nLetter1: ?, Letter2: A, Letter3: ?, Letter4: S, Letter5: ?\n\nExamples:\n- CLASS: C L A S S -> but that\'s A at position 3, not 2. So no.\n- PASTA: P A S T A -> but then position 3 is S, but we need position 4 to be S? \n  Let\'s break: \n  P (1), A (2), S (3), T (4), A (5) -> so position 4 is T, not S.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be S. So:\n\n- GAWKS: G A W K S -> position 4 is K, not S.\n- BASTS: B A S T S -> position 4 is T? \n  B(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), S(5) -> position 4 is T.\n\nI think I\'m having trouble. Let me think of words ending with S? But we need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the fourth letter as S, meaning the last two letters are the fifth and the fourth is S? Not necessarily, because the fifth can be anything.\n\nActually, the word must have the structure: \n[letter1] A [letter3] S [letter5]\n\nSo, for example:\n- MASTS: M A S T S -> \n  M(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), S(5) -> but position 4 is T, not S. We need position 4 to be S? \n  Wait, no: in MASTS, the letters are: \n  Position 1: M\n  Position 2: A\n  Position 3: S\n  Position 4: T\n  Position 5: S\n\nThat doesn\'t have S at position 4.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be S. So the word must have the fourth character as S. \n\nFor example:\n- The word ""PASS"" is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.\n\nLet me think of 5-letter words with S at the fourth position and A at the second.\n\nExamples:\n- CAUSE: C A U S E -> \n  C(1), A(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E is already eliminated (from first feedback: E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.\n\n- FEAST: F E A S T -> \n  F(1), E(2), A(3), S(4), T(5) -> but position 2 is E, not A. We need A at position 2.\n\nWe need A at position 2 and S at position 4.\n\nSo:\n- Letter1: ?\n- Letter2: A\n- Letter3: ?\n- Letter4: S\n- Letter5: ?\n\nAnd the word must not contain R, I, E.\n\nPossible words:\n- HASTY: H A S T Y -> \n  H(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but position 4 is T, not S. We need position 4 to be S, so the third letter is free, but the fourth must be S.\n\nIn HASTY, the fourth letter is T, not S.\n\nI think I\'m making a mistake. Let me clarify: the fourth letter must be S, so in the word, the character at index 3 (if we start counting at 0) or index 4? \n\nIn the feedback, we count positions starting from 1.\n\nFor the word ""RAISE"":\n- R is position 1\n- A is position 2\n- I is position 3\n- S is position 4\n- E is position 5\n\nSo, the feedback said A is correct at position 2 and S is correct at position 4.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n- Position 1: unknown, but not R (since R is not in the word)\n- Position 2: A\n- Position 3: unknown, but not I (since I is not in the word)\n- Position 4: S\n- Position 5: unknown, but not E\n\nSo the pattern is: [not R, not I, not E] A [not R, not I, not E] S [not R, not I, not E]\n\nNow, we need to find a word that fits: _ A _ S _\n\nAnd we must avoid the letters R, I, E.\n\nLet me list some words that fit this pattern:\n\n- TALKS: T A L K S -> \n  Position 1: T, 2: A, 3: L, 4: K, 5: S -> but position 4 is K, not S. We need position 4 to be S.\n\n- We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the fourth character as S.\n\nExamples of words with second letter A and fourth letter S:\n\n- GAZES: but has E and Z? And E is eliminated.\n- JAZZY: J A Z Z Y -> position 4 is Z, not S.\n- I\'m struggling. Let me think of common words.\n\nAnother idea: ""BASIS"" -> B A S I S -> \n  B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5) -> but position 4 is I, not S. And I is eliminated.\n\n""CASKS"": C A S K S -> \n  C(1), A(2), S(3), K(4), S(5) -> position 4 is K.\n\n""PASSE"": P A S S E -> \n  P(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E is eliminated.\n\n""MASSE"": same issue with E.\n\n""WASPS"": W A S P S -> \n  W(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), S(5) -> position 4 is P.\n\nI need to look for words where the fourth letter is S. That means the word has the structure: ??A?S? but with the fourth letter being the fourth character.\n\nActually, the fourth character is the one at index 3 (if we index from 0). So in a 5-letter word, the positions are:\nIndex 0: first letter\nIndex 1: second letter\nIndex 2: third letter\nIndex 3: fourth letter\nIndex 4: fifth letter\n\nWe need:\nIndex 1: A\nIndex 3: S\n\nSo, the word: [0] A [2] S [4]\n\nAnd [0], [2], [4] cannot be R, I, E, and also not the letters we know are absent.\n\nNow, let me think of words:\n\n- ""HASTE"": H A S T E -> \n  [0]:H, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> but [3] is T, not S. And we need [3] to be S.\n\nI think I found one: ""CAUSE"" has [3] as S? \nC A U S E: \n[0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:U, [3]:S, [4]:E -> yes, but [4] is E which is eliminated.\n\n- ""PAUSE"": same issue.\n\n- ""TASTE"": T A S T E -> \n  [0]:T, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> [3] is T, not S.\n\n- ""BASTE"": same as TASTE.\n\n- ""PASTE"": P A S T E -> \n  [0]:P, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:E -> [3] is T.\n\nI need to find a word where the fourth letter (index 3) is S.\n\nFor example:\n- ""GASPS"": G A S P S -> \n  [0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:P, [4]:S -> [3] is P.\n\n- ""CLASS"": C L A S S -> \n  [0]:C, [1]:L, [2]:A, [3]:S, [4]:S -> but [1] is L, not A. We need [1] to be A.\n\nWe need [1] to be A and [3] to be S.\n\nSo, the word must have:\n- The second letter (index 1) is A.\n- The fourth letter (index 3) is S.\n\nSo, the structure: \nLetter0: ?\nLetter1: A\nLetter2: ?\nLetter3: S\nLetter4: ?\n\nAnd the word must not contain R, I, E.\n\nLet me search my vocabulary:\n\n- ""DAISY"": D A I S Y -> \n  [0]:D, [1]:A, [2]:I, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> but I is eliminated (from first feedback: I is not in the word). So we cannot use I.\n\n- ""HASTY"": H A S T Y -> \n  [0]:H, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:T, [4]:Y -> [3] is T, not S.\n\n- ""NASTY"": N A S T Y -> same, [3] is T.\n\n- ""PASTY"": P A S T Y -> same.\n\n- ""TANSY"": T A N S Y -> \n  [0]:T, [1]:A, [2]:N, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> yes! [3] is S.\n\nSo, ""TANSY"" is a word? It means a type of plant. But is it common? In Wordle, the word list might include it.\n\nBut let\'s check the letters: T, A, N, S, Y. \n- T: not eliminated\n- A: we know is in\n- N: new\n- S: we know is in\n- Y: new\n\nAnd it doesn\'t contain R, I, E.\n\nSo, ""TANSY"" fits the pattern and uses new letters.\n\nAnother word: ""MANGO"" doesn\'t have S at position 4.\n\n""BASSO"" is not common.\n\n""CASAS"": C A S A S -> \n  [0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:A, [4]:S -> [3] is A, not S.\n\n""LASSI"": L A S S I -> \n  [0]:L, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:I -> [3] is S, but [4] is I which is eliminated.\n\n""PASHA"": P A S H A -> \n  [0]:P, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:H, [4]:A -> [3] is H.\n\nI think ""TANSY"" is a candidate.\n\nAnother one: ""JASPS"" is not common.\n\nOr ""VASAL"", but [3] is A.\n\nPerhaps ""TAWSE"", but has E.\n\nI think ""TANSY"" is acceptable.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to guess any valid 5-letter word, not necessarily one that fits the known positions. However, it\'s efficient to use the known positions to test other letters.\n\nAlternatively, we might choose a word that doesn\'t have A in position 2 and S in position 4, but that would waste the known information. It\'s better to use them to get more information about the other positions.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""TANSY"".\n\nBut let me confirm: TANSY is a valid word? Yes, it\'s in the dictionary.\n\nSo, guess: TANSY\n\nWe hope to get feedback that tells us about T, N, Y and also confirms A and S (which we already know).\n\nBut note: we know A and S are in the word, but in TANSY, A is at position 2 and S is at position 4, which are the correct positions? We know they are correct, so we expect them to be marked as correct.\n\nHowever, the feedback might show:\n- T: ? \n- A: should be ✓\n- N: ?\n- S: should be ✓\n- Y: ?\n\nBut the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know, but in this case, TANSY has unique letters.\n\nAlternatively, we might choose a word that has different letters to test more.\n\nBut with the constraints, TANSY is a good choice.\n\nAnother common word: ""PASTA"" doesn\'t fit because [3] is T.\n\nOr ""MASTA"" not a word.\n\nI think TANSY is fine.\n\nBut let me think of a more common word: ""HASTY"" doesn\'t have S at [3].\n\nWhat about ""BASES"": B A S E S -> \n  [0]:B, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:E, [4]:S -> [3] is E, eliminated.\n\n""CASES"": same.\n\n""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> \n  [0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:Y -> [3] is S! Yes.\n\nSo, ""GASSY"" is a word. It means containing gas or gaseous.\n\nLetters: G, A, S, S, Y. \n- G: new\n- A: known\n- S: known (but we have two S\'s)\n- Y: new\n\nBut note: the feedback for the first guess said S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4). It didn\'t say anything about multiple S\'s. So there could be multiple S\'s.\n\nIn ""GASSY"", we have S at position 2 and 3? \n[0]:G, [1]:A, [2]:S, [3]:S, [4]:Y\n\nSo position 4 is [3] which is S, so that matches. And position 2 is A, which matches.\n\nBut we have an extra S at position 2? [2] is S.\n\nThe secret word might have an S at position 3? We don\'t know.\n\nBut in our first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was correct. We didn\'t have S at position 3 in the first guess (we had I at position 3). So we don\'t know about position 3.\n\nSo ""GASSY"" is also a candidate.\n\nBut ""GASSY"" has two S\'s. It might be a good test because if the secret word has only one S, then one of the S\'s in GASSY might be marked as wrong position or not present? But we know position 4 must be S, so the S at position 3 in GASSY might be additional.\n\nBut to avoid complexity, maybe a word with unique letters is better. TANSY has unique letters.\n\nHowever, TANSY is less common. Let me see if there\'s a more common word.\n\nAnother word: ""PAYSA"" not a word.\n\n""TASSA"" not common.\n\n""CANST"": C A N S T -> \n  [0]:C, [1]:A, [2]:N, [3]:S, [4]:T -> yes! [3] is S.\n\n""CANST"" is an archaic word for can or container, but might be in the word list.\n\n""HASTY"" doesn\'t work.\n\n""NASTY"" doesn\'t work.\n\n""PASTY"" doesn\'t work.\n\n""RASTA"" has R, which is eliminated.\n\nI think ""TANSY"" or ""GASSY"" or ""CANST"" are options.\n\nBut ""GASSY"" is in the Wordle word list, I believe.\n\nTo maximize new letters, TANSY has T, N, Y which are new.\n\nGASSY has G and Y, but S is repeated.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, I\'d prefer to test more new letters.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""TANSY"".\n\nBut let me check: in the first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was correct. In TANSY, we are putting S at position 4 again, which is safe because we know it\'s correct. And A at position 2 is also correct.\n\nThe new letters are T at 1, N at 3, Y at 5.\n\nSo, after this guess, we will know about T, N, Y.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""TANSY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R, I, and E are not in the secret word.\n- A is in the correct position (position 2).\n- S is in the correct position (position 4).\n\nThe secret word must have the form: _ A _ S _, and it cannot contain R, I, or E. For the second guess, I chose ""TANSY"" because:\n- It fits the known pattern (A at position 2, S at position 4).\n- It introduces new common letters (T, N, Y) that haven\'t been tested yet.\n- It avoids the eliminated letters (R, I, E).\n\nThis guess will help test the presence of T, N, and Y, and confirm the positions of A and S.\n\n<guess>TANSY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: TANSY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) N(x) S(✓) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so position 2 is A)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- S: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so position 4 is S)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: TANSY\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, position 2 is A, confirmed again)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- S: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, position 4 is S, confirmed again)\n- Y: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so position 5 is Y)\n\nSo, from the feedback, we now know:\n- The secret word has the second letter A, fourth letter S, and fifth letter Y. So the pattern is: _ A _ S Y\n- We also know that the letters R, I, E, T, N are not in the word.\n\nTherefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter1] A [letter3] S Y\n\nAnd we need to find letter1 and letter3, which cannot be R, I, E, T, N, and also not any other eliminated letters. Currently, eliminated letters are: R, I, E, T, N.\n\nWe have two positions to guess: position 1 and position 3.\n\nWe need to make a third guess. We should choose a word that fits the pattern and uses new letters to test for position 1 and 3.\n\nThe pattern: [1] A [3] S Y\n\nWe know position 1 and 3 must be filled with letters not in the eliminated set.\n\nCommon letters that haven\'t been tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (but note, we have to form a valid word).\n\nWe need to find a word that has the form: [1] A [3] S Y\n\nLet\'s think of possible words:\n\n- DAISY: but D A I S Y -> I is eliminated, so not allowed.\n- HAWKS: H A W K S -> but the last letter is S, not Y, and we need Y at the end. Also, the pattern requires S at position 4 and Y at 5, so HAWKS ends with KS, not SY.\n- We need the word to end with ""SY"".\n\nSo, the last three letters are A (at 2), then S (at 4), and Y (at 5). But note: position 3 is between A and S, so the word has: letter1, then A, then letter3, then S, then Y.\n\nSo the word is: [1]A[3]SY\n\nExamples:\n- DAISY: D A I S Y -> but I is eliminated.\n- PANSY: P A N S Y -> but N is eliminated (from guess 2, N is not in the word).\n- MOSSY: M O S S Y -> but position 2 is O, not A.\n- JAZZY: J A Z Z Y -> but then position 3 is Z, position 4 is Z, not S. We need position 4 to be S.\n\nWe need position 4 to be S, so the word must have S at the fourth position and Y at the fifth.\n\nSo, the third letter (position 3) is before the S, so the word has: [1] A [3] S Y\n\nPossible words:\n- ""HASPY"" - not a common word.\n- ""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> but then position 3 is S, and position 4 is S. So the word is G A S S Y. \n  - This has S at position 3 and S at position 4. But we know position 4 is S, so that\'s fine. However, in this case, position 3 is also S. But we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s or not.\n\nBut in ""GASSY"", the pattern is:\n  Position 1: G\n  Position 2: A\n  Position 3: S\n  Position 4: S\n  Position 5: Y\n\nBut we know position 4 is S, so if we guess GASSY, then:\n- Position 2: A is correct (we know)\n- Position 4: S is correct (we know)\n- Position 5: Y is correct (we know from guess 2)\n\nBut we are testing position 1 (G) and position 3 (S). However, if the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 3 might be marked as absent or wrong position? But we know position 4 has S, so if there is only one S, then the S at position 3 would be extra and might be marked as not present? But actually, in Wordle, if there is only one S and it is at position 4, then the S at position 3 would be marked as absent (x) because the single S is already used at position 4.\n\nBut in our case, we know position 4 is S, so if the secret word has another S, then it might be possible.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid using S at position 3 to not complicate.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words ending with ""SY"" and having A at position 2.\n\nThe only common word I can think of is ""DANDY"" but that doesn\'t have S.\n\nAnother one: ""LASSY"" - but L A S S Y, same as GASSY.\n\nOr ""MASSY"": M A S S Y.\n\nBut these all have S at position 3.\n\nWhat about ""PALSY"": P A L S Y -> \n  Position 1: P\n  Position 2: A\n  Position 3: L\n  Position 4: S\n  Position 5: Y\n\nYes! This fits perfectly: P A L S Y.\n\nAnd L is a new letter, not eliminated.\n\nSimilarly, ""BALSY"" - not a word.\n\n""JALSY"" - not a word.\n\n""WALSY"" - not common.\n\nSo ""PALSY"" is a valid word, meaning a condition.\n\nAnother one: ""HALSY"" - not common.\n\n""GAYLY"" - G A Y L Y -> but position 3 is Y, and position 5 is Y, but we need position 4 to be S, which it\'s not.\n\nSo, ""PALSY"" seems a good candidate.\n\nAnother possibility: ""FANCY"" but no S.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be S, so it must be ...S at the end, but with Y at the end, so ...SY.\n\nSo, the only common words I can think of are those with double S like GASSY, MASSY, or PALSY.\n\nBut PALSY has L at position 3.\n\nAlso, ""DAISY"" is out because of I.\n\nSo, I think ""PALSY"" is a good guess.\n\nWe can also consider ""HASTY"", but H A S T Y -> position 4 is T, not S. We need position 4 to be S.\n\nNo, we know position 4 is S, so we must have S at position 4.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""PALSY"".\n\nIn ""PALSY"":\n- P: new letter\n- A: known correct\n- L: new letter\n- S: known correct\n- Y: known correct\n\nWe are testing P and L.\n\nIf the secret word is ""PALSY"", then we win.\n\nOtherwise, we get feedback on P and L.\n\nBut note: we have only two positions unknown, so we might solve it in this guess or the next.\n\nAnother word: ""JAZZY"" doesn\'t have S.\n\nOr ""BUSKY"" not common.\n\nI think ""PALSY"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let me confirm if there are other options.\n\n""CASKY"" not a word.\n\n""BASSO"" doesn\'t end with Y.\n\nWe know the word ends with Y, because position 5 is Y.\n\nSo, the word must end with SY.\n\nOther words: ""MOSSY"" has O at position 2, not A.\n\n""FUSSY"" has U at position 2.\n\nSo, ""PALSY"" seems the best.\n\nWe could guess a word that doesn\'t have A, S, Y in their positions to test more letters, but that would be inefficient because we know those positions are fixed. It\'s better to use the known positions to focus on the unknown ones.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""PALSY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: A is correct and in position 2, S is correct and in position 4. R, I, and E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (TANSY)**: A (position 2), S (position 4), and Y (position 5) are correct. T and N are absent.\n\nThe secret word must have the pattern: `_ A _ S Y`, with positions 2, 4, and 5 confirmed. Absent letters are R, I, E, T, and N.\n\nFor the third guess, I chose **PALSY** because:\n- It fits the known pattern (A at position 2, S at position 4, Y at position 5).\n- It tests new common letters (P and L) for the unknown positions (1 and 3).\n- It avoids all eliminated letters (R, I, E, T, N).\n\nThis guess will help identify if P or L is in the word and their positions, bringing us closer to solving the puzzle.\n\n<guess>PALSY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: TANSY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) N(x) S(✓) Y(✓)\nGuess 3: PALSY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) L(x) S(✓) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE\n- R: absent (x)\n- A: correct position (✓) at position 2\n- I: absent (x)\n- S: correct position (✓) at position 4\n- E: absent (x)\n\nGuess 2: TANSY\n- T: absent (x)\n- A: correct position (✓) at position 2\n- N: absent (x)\n- S: correct position (✓) at position 4\n- Y: correct position (✓) at position 5\n\nGuess 3: PALSY\n- P: absent (x)\n- A: correct position (✓) at position 2\n- L: absent (x)\n- S: correct position (✓) at position 4\n- Y: correct position (✓) at position 5\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word has the pattern: _ A _ S Y\n- Confirmed letters in position: \n  - Position 2: A\n  - Position 4: S\n  - Position 5: Y\n- Absent letters: R, I, E, T, N, P, L\n\nWe need to find the first and third letters. The first letter (position 1) and the third letter (position 3) must be letters that are not in the absent list and form a valid English word.\n\nThe absent letters so far: R, I, E, T, N, P, L.\n\nPossible letters for position 1 and 3: any letter not in {R, I, E, T, N, P, L}. This includes: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note that Y is already used at the end, and A is at position 2, so they might be repeated? We don\'t have information about duplicates yet.\n\nHowever, in the pattern _ A _ S Y, the A and S are fixed, and Y is fixed. The first and third positions are open.\n\nWe need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but so far, we haven\'t encountered any duplicates in the feedback. For example, in PALSY, we had S at position 4, but we don\'t know if S can appear again. Similarly, A and Y might be duplicated.\n\nBut to be safe, we should consider both possibilities.\n\nNow, let\'s think of words that fit the pattern _ A _ S Y.\n\nPossible words:\n- We already tried PALSY, which didn\'t work because P and L are absent.\n- Other possibilities: \n  - DAISY: but I is absent, so invalid.\n  - MAISY: M A I S Y -> I is absent, invalid.\n  - BAISY: not a word? Or B A I S Y, but I absent.\n  - GAWSY: not common, and W might be possible? But let\'s check.\n\nActually, common words:\n- ""HASPY"" - not a common word.\n- ""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> but we have S at position 3 and 4. However, in this case, position 3 is S, which we haven\'t tested directly. But note, in the pattern, position 3 is the third letter, which in GASSY is S. But we know position 4 is S, so if we guess GASSY, we are testing if there is an S at position 3 as well.\n\nBut we have to consider the feedback: if the secret word has only one S (at position 4), then the S at position 3 in GASSY would be marked as absent? Or if it\'s present but in the wrong position? But since position 4 is already S, and if there is no other S, then the S at position 3 should be absent.\n\nBut in our case, we know S is at position 4, so we can have a word with two S\'s.\n\nSimilarly, ""MASSY"": M A S S Y.\n\nBut let\'s list valid words that fit _ A _ S Y and don\'t use absent letters.\n\nThe third letter (position 3) must be a letter not absent, and not conflicting.\n\nPossible candidates:\n- ""CASKY"" - not a word.\n- ""DASHY"": D A S H Y -> but position 3 is S? No: D A S H Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:A, 3:S, 4:H, 5:Y -> but we need position 4 to be S, so this has H at position 4, not S. So invalid pattern.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the third letter and then S at fourth.\n\nSo the pattern is: [1] A [3] S Y\n\nSo the third letter is at position 3, then S at 4.\n\nSo, for example:\n- ""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> positions: 1:G, 2:A, 3:S, 4:S, 5:Y -> so position 3 is S, position 4 is S.\n- ""MASSY"": M A S S Y -> same.\n- ""BASSY"": B A S S Y -> same.\n\nBut also:\n- ""PASSY"" - not common, but similar.\n\nBut we have ""PALSY"" which we tried, with L at position 3.\n\nAnother word: ""WASPY"": W A S P Y -> positions: 1:W, 2:A, 3:S, 4:P, 5:Y -> but position 4 is P, not S. So invalid.\n\nWe need position 4 to be S, so the word must have S at position 4. Therefore, the letter at position 3 can be anything, but the next is S.\n\nSo, the only way to have S at position 4 is if the word has ...AS Y, but with a letter in between.\n\nActually, the word is: letter1, A, letter3, S, Y.\n\nSo, for ""GASSY"": letter3 is S, so it\'s A followed by S (at position 3), then S again at 4? No:\n\nIn ""GASSY"":\n- Position 1: G\n- Position 2: A\n- Position 3: S\n- Position 4: S\n- Position 5: Y\n\nSo, position 3 is S, position 4 is S. So the pattern is satisfied because position 4 is S.\n\nSimilarly, in ""PALSY"", position 3 is L, position 4 is S.\n\nNow, we have eliminated P and L for position 1 and 3 in the last guess.\n\nSo, for position 1, we cannot use P, and for position 3, we cannot use L.\n\nAlso, we cannot use R,I,E,T,N.\n\nSo, what are possible words?\n\n- ""GASSY"": G at position 1, S at position 3. But we haven\'t tested G or the double S.\n- ""BASSY"": B at 1, S at 3.\n- ""MASSY"": M at 1, S at 3.\n- ""CASSY"": C at 1, S at 3. But ""CASSY"" might be a name, but let\'s consider if it\'s valid.\n- ""DASSY"": not common.\n- ""FASSY"": not common.\n- ""HASSY"": not common.\n- ""JASSY"": not common.\n- ""KASSY"": not common.\n- ""SASSY"": S A S S Y -> but position 1 is S, and we have S at position 4. But we don\'t know if S can be at position 1. Also, we have not tested S at position 1.\n\n""SASSY"": \n- Position 1: S\n- Position 2: A\n- Position 3: S\n- Position 4: S\n- Position 5: Y\n\nThis has three S\'s. But we know position 4 is S, so it\'s possible.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested S at position 1 or 3.\n\nNow, we need to choose a guess that tests new letters.\n\nBut we have only two positions to guess, and we can try a word that uses new letters for position 1 and 3.\n\nPossible new letters for position 1: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (avoiding R,I,E,T,N,P,L)\n\nFor position 3: same, but note that if we use a word with S at position 3, that might be efficient if we think there is a double S.\n\nBut we don\'t have evidence of double S yet.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t use S at position 3 to test a different letter.\n\nFor example, what other letters can be at position 3?\n\nIn ""PALSY"" we tried L, which was absent. So position 3 cannot be L.\n\nWhat about other letters? For example, ""DAISY"" is out because of I.\n\n""MAYBE"" doesn\'t have S.\n\nAnother word: ""HABIT"" doesn\'t fit.\n\nLet\'s list all possible words that fit the pattern and use allowed letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- With no double S: \n  - ""WASPY"" - but position 4 is P, not S. No.\n  - ""JAZZY"" - no S.\n  - ""FAWNY"" - no S.\n  - ""CABBY"" - no S.\n\nI think the only common words with the pattern _ A _ S Y are those with double S or PALSY (which we tried).\n\nBut PALSY didn\'t work.\n\nSo, perhaps the word has double S.\n\nLet me think: ""GASSY"", ""BASSY"", ""SASSY"", ""MASSY"", etc.\n\nWe can try ""GASSY"" to test.\n\nBut we have to make a guess.\n\nAnother possibility: ""DASHY"" is D A S H Y, but that has S at position 3 and H at 4, not S at 4. So it doesn\'t fit the pattern.\n\nWe need position 4 to be S, so the only way is to have the third letter and then S, so if the third letter is not S, then the word must have a letter at 3 and then S at 4.\n\nFor example, ""PALSY"" has L at 3 and S at 4.\n\nSimilarly, what about ""BALSY""? Not a word.\n\n""FALSY"" - not common, but in programming, but might not be in word list.\n\n""JASPY"" - not common.\n\nI think we are left with the double S words.\n\nSo, let\'s try ""GASSY"".\n\nIn ""GASSY"", we have:\n- G at position 1: new letter\n- A at 2: known\n- S at 3: we are testing if S is present and if it can be at position 3\n- S at 4: known\n- Y at 5: known\n\nIf the secret word is ""GASSY"", we win.\n\nIf not, we might get feedback that G is absent or the S at position 3 is not correct (if there is no second S).\n\nBut if the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 3 in GASSY would be marked as absent, even though S is in the word, because the only S is at position 4 and is already used.\n\nSo, the feedback would show:\n- G: ? \n- A: ✓\n- S: might be x (if no second S) or ✓ (if there is second S at position 3)\n- S: ✓ (because position 4 is S)\n- Y: ✓\n\nBut the first S (position 3) would be marked as absent if there is no second S.\n\nAlternatively, if the word is ""SASSY"", then position 1 is S, which we haven\'t tested.\n\nBut we don\'t know if S can be at position 1.\n\nTo be systematic, let\'s choose a word that uses a new letter for position 1 and a new letter for position 3, but if we avoid S at position 3, what are the options?\n\nFor example, is there a word like ""BABY"" but 5 letters? No.\n\n""JAGSY"" not a word.\n\n""QUASY"" not a word.\n\nI think the only practical choices are the double S words or perhaps we missed a word.\n\nAnother word: ""HASTY"" but position 4 is T, not S.\n\n""PASTY"" same.\n\n""NASTY"" same.\n\n""TASTY"" same.\n\n""RASPY"" has R, which is absent.\n\n""GASPY"" not common.\n\n""WASHY"" W A S H Y -> position 4 is H, not S.\n\nSo, I think we have to go with a double S word.\n\nLet\'s choose ""SASSY"" because it also tests S at position 1.\n\nBut position 1 is S, which we haven\'t tested as absent, but we know S is in the word at position 4, so it could be at position 1 as well.\n\nSo, ""SASSY"" has S at position 1, A at 2, S at 3, S at 4, Y at 5.\n\nIf we guess ""SASSY"", and the secret word is ""GASSY"", then:\n- Position 1: S vs G, so S would be marked as absent? But S is in the word at position 4, so if there is only one S, then S at position 1 and 3 would be marked as absent or wrong position? \n\nThis might be messy.\n\nPerhaps ""GASSY"" is a safer guess because it uses a new letter G.\n\nLet\'s list all possible words that fit the pattern and allowed letters:\n\n- GASSY: G at 1, S at 3\n- BASSY: B at 1, S at 3\n- CASSY: C at 1, S at 3 (CASSY is a name, but might be accepted)\n- MASSY: M at 1, S at 3\n- SASSY: S at 1, S at 3\n- etc.\n\nWe can try ""BASIS"" but doesn\'t end with Y.\n\nGiven that, I\'ll go with ""GASSY"" as the next guess.\n\nBut we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use a word that tests two new letters without S at position 3.\n\nFor example, is there a word like ""DADDY"" but no S.\n\nOr ""FADDY"" not a word.\n\n""JUDGY"" not.\n\nI think it\'s hard, so I\'ll go with ""GASSY"".\n\nSo, guess: GASSY\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nIf the secret word is ""GASSY"", we win.\n\nIf not, and if G is absent, then we know position 1 is not G, and the S at position 3 might be absent (if no second S), then we know position 3 is not S, and we can try other letters.\n\nBut if position 3 is not S, then what other letter can it be? We have no other common words.\n\nUnless we missed a word.\n\nAnother word: ""DALLY"" but no S.\n\n""GALLY"" not.\n\n""PALLY"" has P and L, which are absent.\n\nI think we have to try.\n\nPerhaps ""HAPPY"" but no S.\n\nI think ""GASSY"" is the best bet.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with that.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Review Previous Feedback**:\n   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: \n     - R (absent), A (correct position 2), I (absent), S (correct position 4), E (absent).\n   - **Guess 2 (TANSY)**:\n     - T (absent), A (correct position 2), N (absent), S (correct position 4), Y (correct position 5).\n   - **Guess 3 (PALSY)**:\n     - P (absent), A (correct position 2), L (absent), S (correct position 4), Y (correct position 5).\n\n2. **Deductions from Feedback**:\n   - The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ A _ S Y` (positions: 2=A, 4=S, 5=Y).\n   - Confirmed absent letters: **R, I, E, T, N, P, L** (from all guesses).\n   - Unknown positions: **1 and 3** need to be filled with letters not in the absent list.\n   - Possible letters for positions 1 and 3: Any letter not in {R, I, E, T, N, P, L}, such as B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. Note that A, S, and Y are confirmed but could potentially repeat (though no evidence yet).\n\n3. **Evaluate Possible Words**:\n   - The pattern `_ A _ S Y` limits options. Common words fitting this pattern include:\n     - **GASSY**: G at position 1, S at position 3.\n     - **BASSY**: B at position 1, S at position 3.\n     - **MASSY**: M at position 1, S at position 3.\n     - **SASSY**: S at position 1, S at position 3.\n   - Words like DAISY or PALSY are invalid (contain absent letters I or L/P).\n   - Since position 3 could be S (allowing double S), testing a word with S at position 3 is efficient. It tests if a second S exists and uses new letters for position 1.\n   - **Why choose GASSY?** \n     - It tests a new letter (G) for position 1 and S for position 3.\n     - If G is correct, we solve position 1. If not, we eliminate G.\n     - The S at position 3 tests for a potential double S (if present, it confirms; if absent, it rules out S for position 3).\n     - GASSY is a valid English word (meaning ""resembling or full of gas""), avoiding absent letters.\n\n4. **Strategy**:\n   - With only positions 1 and 3 unknown, GASSY maximizes information by testing a new consonant (G) and the double-S possibility.\n   - If GASSY is incorrect, feedback on G and the position 3 S will narrow options further (e.g., if S at position 3 is absent, we eliminate double S and focus on other letters for position 3 like B, M, etc.).\n\n<guess>GASSY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: TANSY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) N(x) S(✓) Y(✓)\nGuess 3: PALSY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) L(x) S(✓) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: GASSY -> FEEDBACK: G(x) A(✓) S(✓) S(✓) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from four guesses:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE → R(x), A(✓ position 2), I(x), S(✓ position 4), E(x)\nGuess 2: TANSY → T(x), A(✓ position 2), N(x), S(✓ position 4), Y(✓ position 5)\nGuess 3: PALSY → P(x), A(✓ position 2), L(x), S(✓ position 4), Y(✓ position 5)\nGuess 4: GASSY → G(x), A(✓ position 2), S(✓), S(✓), Y(✓)\n\nFor Guess 4: GASSY\n- The word is G A S S Y\n- Feedback: G(x), A(✓), S(✓), S(✓), Y(✓)\n\nBreakdown:\n- Position 1: G → marked (x) → absent\n- Position 2: A → marked (✓) → correct (as we know)\n- Position 3: S → marked (✓) → this means the S at position 3 is in the word and in the correct position? But we already knew S is at position 4. This suggests that there is an additional S at position 3.\n- Position 4: S → marked (✓) → correct (as we know)\n- Position 5: Y → marked (✓) → correct (as we know)\n\nThe feedback for S at position 3 being (✓) means:\n- The letter S is present and correctly placed at position 3.\n- But position 3 is the third position, which we didn\'t know before.\n\nHowever, this adds new information: we now know that position 3 must be S because it\'s marked as correct.\n\nBut let\'s recall:\nThe secret word has:\n- Position 2: A\n- Position 4: S\n- Position 5: Y\n\nAnd now from Guess 4, we have:\n- Position 3: S is marked correct → so the secret word has S at position 3.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must be: _ A S S Y\n\nBecause:\n- Position 3 is S (from this feedback)\n- Position 4 is S (already known)\n\nSo the secret word is: [letter1] A S S Y\n\nAnd we know position 1 is not G (since G is absent).\n\nAlso, from previous feedbacks, we have absent letters: R, I, E, T, N, P, L, and now G.\n\nSo position 1 cannot be any of R,I,E,T,N,P,L,G.\n\nThe pattern is: [1] A S S Y\n\nWe need to find position 1, which must be a letter not in the absent set.\n\nThe secret word is fixed except the first letter: _ A S S Y\n\nAnd we know it can\'t be any of the absent letters.\n\nBased on the feedback, G is absent, but we have S at position 3 marked correct, so that position is now known.\n\nSo the secret word is actually of the form: [1] A S S Y\n\nNow, we have to guess the first letter.\n\nPossible candidates:\n- BASSY? But we need a valid word.\n- CASSY, MASSY, SASSY, etc.\n\nBut SASSY has S at position 1.\n\nWe can list words ending with ""ASSY"":\n- CLASSY → 6 letters, too long.\n- GLASSY → G is absent, but it starts with G? GLASSY: G L A S S Y → 6 letters? No, GLASS is 5 letters? GLASS: G L A S S → but that doesn\'t end with Y? Wait.\n\nWe need 5-letter words: ? A S S Y\n\nSo:\n- BASSY: B A S S Y → B is possible? But BASSY is a word? It means bass-like or relating to bass, but it might be accepted.\n- CASSY: C A S S Y → a name?\n- MASSY: M A S S Y → meaning massive, solid; valid.\n- SASSY: S A S S Y → valid.\n- WASSY: not common.\n- KASSY: not common, etc.\n\nBut we must use only allowed letters for position 1.\n\nGiven absent letters: R,I,E,T,N,P,L,G\n\nFor position 1, we can try B, M, S, etc. S is not absent yet, even though it appears elsewhere.\n\nPossible guesses:\n- ""MASSY"": M A S S Y\n- ""BASSY"": B A S S Y\n- ""SASSY"": S A S S Y\n\nBut note, in our pattern, the first letter is the only unknown.\n\nWe should choose a word that is valid and tests a possible first letter.\n\nSince we have no constraints on duplicates, S could be at position 1.\n\nLet\'s make a guess for position 1.\n\nTry ""SASSY"": S A S S Y\n\nIf we are to guess this, we can confirm or deny S at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, ""MASSY"" tests M, ""BASSY"" tests B, etc.\n\nBut we have limited guesses: we are on guess 5 out of 6.\n\nWe can choose any.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SASSY"" because S hasn\'t been tested at position 1. In previous guesses, we had S at position 4 and now position 3, but position 1 is new.\n\nIf we guess SASSY:\n- Position 1: S\n- Position 2: A (known)\n- Position 3: S (known now)\n- Position 4: S (known)\n- Position 5: Y (known)\n\nThe only uncertainty is whether S can be at position 1 or not.\n\nIf the secret word is SASSY, we win.\n\nIf not, we learn that S is absent or in the wrong position for position 1? But we know S is present at other positions, but it could be that there is no S at position 1, meaning the word has exactly two S\'s: at position 3 and 4. Since position 1 and 3 conflict? No, position 1 is a separate position.\n\nIf S is at position 1, and we have S at 3 and 4, that\'s fine.\n\nBut if the secret word is ""MASSY"", then S at position 1 in SASSY would be wrong.\n\nSo feedback would mark:\n- Position 1: S could be x if not present at that position.\n\nThen we can try M or B, etc.\n\nBut we can also guess ""MASSY"" directly.\n\nSince we are guessing the complete word, we should pick one.\n\nTo be efficient, ""SASSY"" is common and worth trying.\n\nAlternatively, note that from the feedback of Guess 4: GASSY had the S at position 3 marked correct, meaning that the secret word has S at position 3. Similarly, S at position 4 is correct. So the secret word has at least two S\'s (if the same S cannot be counted twice? But in Wordle, each S in the guess is compared to available S\'s in the secret).\n\nBut anyway, we now know positions 3 and 4 are S.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must be ? A S S Y.\n\nNow, what 5-letter words match this?\n\nValid words:\n- BASSY (adjective: relating to bass, low sound)\n- CASSY (rare, but sometimes a name)\n- MASSY (meaning massive, heavy)\n- SASSY (meaning lively, bold)\n- WASSY (uncommon)\n\nGiven common usage, ""SASSY"" or ""MASSY"" are more likely.\n\nWe can try ""SASSY"" first.\n\nBut let\'s count the absent letters: R,I,E,T,N,P,L,G are absent.\n\nSo, if we guess ""SASSY"", and it\'s not the word, and S is not at position 1, we eliminate S for position 1, and then try another letter like B, M, etc.\n\nWith one guess left after this, we can guess correctly.\n\nBut ""SASSY"" uses S at position 1, which hasn\'t been eliminated.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""SASSY"".### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Review Previous Feedback**:\n   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: \n     - R (absent), A (correct position 2), I (absent), S (correct position 4), E (absent).\n     - Deduction: Word has A at position 2 and S at position 4.\n   - **Guess 2 (TANSY)**: \n     - T (absent), A (correct position 2), N (absent), S (correct position 4), Y (correct position 5).\n     - Deduction: Confirms A at position 2, S at position 4, and introduces Y at position 5. Absent letters: R, I, E, T, N.\n     - Word pattern: `_ A _ S Y`.\n   - **Guess 3 (PALSY)**: \n     - P (absent), A (correct position 2), L (absent), S (correct position 4), Y (correct position 5).\n     - Deduction: Confirms positions 2, 4, and 5.

This reveals the secret word has S at both positions 3 and 4.\n     - Deduction: The word pattern is now `_ A S S Y`, with only position 1 unknown. Absent letters: R, I, E, T, N, P, L, G.\n\n2. **Analyze Current Constraints**:\n   - Secret word must match `_ A S S Y`.\n   - Position 1 must be a letter not in the absent list: Cannot be R, I, E, T, N, P, L, or G.\n   - Possible letters for position 1: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (etc.) but must form a valid English word.\n   - Less common options: \n     - Words like ""WASSY"" or ""KASSY"" are rare/not standard, so prioritize common words.\n   - Most probable valid words fitting the pattern:\n     - **BASSY**: Meaning ""resembling bass"" (low frequency sound). Valid and common enough.\n     - **MASSY**: Meaning ""massive, solid"". Valid and relatively common.\n     - **SASSY**: Meaning ""lively, bold"". Very common, but ""S"" at position 1 may be redundant (not ruled out yet).\n     - **CASSY/CASSY**: Rare/name, not ideal if common word list is assumed.\n\n3. **Select Guess Strategy**:\n   - Goal: Narrow down position 1 with a word that tests remaining possibilities efficiently.\n   - ""BASSY"" introduces a new letter (B) for elimination if wrong, and is a valid 5-letter word.\n   - ""MASSY"" tests M, but SASSY tests S at position 1 (which has overlap risk if S is triple, but feedback doesn\'t forbid this).\n   - Based on the Wordle word list, ""SASSY"" is more common than BASSY/MASSY, but it uses S again. Given we have only 2 guesses left, prioritize testing a new letter.\n   - **Chose ""BASSY""**: It tests B—a new letter—and fits the pattern perfectly. If wrong, feedback will confirm absence of B (or success), making position 1 solvable with the next guess.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - With `_ A S S Y` pattern and absent letters (R,I,E,T,N,P,L,G), ""BASSY"" is a sensible test for position 1 using B.\n   - If incorrect, next guess (e.g., ""MASSY"" or ""SASSY"") will be required.\n\n<guess>BASSSY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: TANSY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) N(x) S(✓) Y(✓)\nGuess 3: PALSY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) L(x) S(✓) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: GASSY -> FEEDBACK: G(x) A(✓) S(✓) S(✓) Y(✓)\nGuess 5: BASSSY -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.\n'}]","<think>
We are at guess 5. The previous feedback for guess 5 was that ""BASSSY"" is not five letters. That was a typo; it should be ""BASSY"" (5 letters). Let me correct that.

But the user message says: ""Guess 5: BASSSY -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters."" So we must have made an invalid guess. We need to make a valid 5-letter word.

In the previous step, I suggested ""BASSY"", which is 5 letters: B-A-S-S-Y. But the guess was written as ""BASSSY"", which has 6 characters. That must be a mistake.

So for the new guess, we must use a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern.

Current known information:
- The secret word is of the form: [1] A S S Y
- Absent letters: R, I, E, T, N, P, L, G
- Therefore, position 1 must be a letter not in {R, I, E, T, N, P, L, G}

Possible words:
- BASSY: B A S S Y (5 letters)
- MASSY: M A S S Y (5 letters)
- SASSY: S A S S Y (5 letters)
- CASSY: C A S S Y (5 letters, though less common)
- etc.

We must choose one that is 5 letters and valid.

Since ""BASSSY"" was invalid, we should use the correct spelling: ""BASSY"".

But the feedback said ""Model answer is not five letters"", meaning the guess was invalid. So we need to make a new guess that is valid.

I think the issue was the guess was written as ""BASSSY"" (with three S's) instead of ""BASSY"" (two S's). So for the next guess, we should write it correctly.

But the user message says we are to make a new guess, so we are now at guess 5 again? Or do we proceed to guess 6? The user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" after providing feedback for guess 5 being invalid.

Looking at the history:
- Guess 1 to 4 are done.
- Guess 5 was attempted as ""BASSSY"" and invalid.

So now we are still at guess 5, and we need to provide a valid 5-letter word.

We'll use ""BASSY"" (correctly spelled) as the guess.

But to be safe, let's confirm the pattern: the word must be 5 letters, starting with a letter, then A, then S, then S, then Y.

So, ""BASSY"" is B-A-S-S-Y, which is 5 letters.

Similarly, ""MASSY"" is M-A-S-S-Y, etc.

I'll go with ""BASSY"".

But note: the feedback for guess 4 showed that position 3 is S, so the word is _ A S S Y.

So, for guess 5, we guess ""BASSY"".

If it's invalid again, we must choose another, but I think it's valid.

Alternatively, we can choose ""SASSY"" to be different.

But I think ""BASSY"" is fine.

So, let's output ""BASSY"".

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: 
     - R (absent), A (correct position 2), I (absent), S (correct position 4), E (absent).
     - Deduction: Secret word has A at position 2 and S at position 4.
   - **Guess 2 (TANSY)**:
     - T (absent), A (correct position 2), N (absent), S (correct position 4), Y (correct position 5).
     - Deduction: Confirms A at position 2, S at position 4, and Y at position 5. Absent letters: R, I, E, T, N.
     - Word pattern: `_ A _ S Y`.
   - **Guess 3 (PALSY)**:
     - P (absent), A (correct position 2), L (absent), S (correct position 4), Y (correct position 5).
     - Deduction: Confirms positions 2, 4, and 5. Absent letters expand: R, I, E, T, N, P, L.
     - Word pattern remains `_ A _ S Y` (positions 1 and 3 unknown).
   - **Guess 4 (GASSY)**:
     - G (absent), A (correct position 2), S (correct position 3), S (correct position 4), Y (correct position 5).
     - Critical new info: Position 3 is S (marked ✓), revealing the secret word has S at both positions 3 and 4.
     - Deduction: Word pattern is now `_ A S S Y`, with only position 1 unknown. Absent letters: R, I, E, T, N, P, L, G.
   - **Guess 5 (Invalid)**: 
     - ""BASSSY"" was rejected for being 6 letters (invalid). Correction: Valid 5-letter words for this pattern include **BASSY** (B-A-S-S-Y), **MASSY** (M-A-S-S-Y), or **SASSY** (S-A-S-S-Y).

2. **Current Constraints**:
   - Secret word must be `[letter] A S S Y`.
   - Position 1 must be a letter **not** in the absent list: R, I, E, T, N, P, L, G.
   - Possible letters for position 1: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (but must form a valid English word).
   - Common valid words fitting `_ A S S Y`:
     - **BASSY**: Adjective meaning ""resembling bass"" (low sound). Tests B at position 1.
     - **MASSY**: Adjective meaning ""massive or solid"". Tests M at position 1.
     - **SASSY**: Adjective meaning ""bold or lively"". Tests S at position 1 (S is already confirmed at positions 3–4, but not ruled out for position 1).

3. **Selecting the Guess**:
   - **Why BASSY?** 
     - Tests a new letter (B) not previously attempted, maximizing information gain.
     - If B is correct, we solve the puzzle. If B is absent, we eliminate it and narrow position 1 to other options (e.g., M or S).
     - BASSY is a valid 5-letter word (unlike the invalid ""BASSSY"" typo).
   - Alternatives like MASSY or SASSY are also valid but less ideal: 
     - MASSY tests M (also new), but B is a more common starting letter.
     - SASSY tests S at position 1, which could be redundant if the word has only two S's (though feedback allows for triple S). Prioritizing a new letter (B) is safer.
   - With 2 guesses left (after this), BASSY efficiently reduces possibilities.
