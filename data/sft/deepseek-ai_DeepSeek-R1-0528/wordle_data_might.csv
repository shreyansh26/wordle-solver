We are given feedback for our first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). This means none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word.
 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain any of the letters C, R, A, N, E.

 Since the letters C, R, A, N, E are eliminated, we should use other letters.

 We can consider common vowels and consonants that are left. Vowels left: O, I, U (since A and E are out). Consonants: many, but avoid the used ones.

 Let's list some common letters not in the excluded set: S, T, L, O, H, D, M, etc.

 We want a word that uses new letters to maximize information. We can try a word like ""MOIST"" or ""PIOUS"", but note that we don't have E or A.

 Alternatively, ""SLOTH"" is a word without C,R,A,N,E.

 But let's pick one with more common letters. How about ""TOILS""? But that has I and O, which are vowels we haven't tried.

 Another good candidate: ""POUTY"" but Y might not be as common.

 Since we don't have any correct positions, we need to cover new ground.

 Let me choose ""LUMPS"": L, U, M, P, S. This uses L, U, M, P, S which are all new.

 But maybe we want a word with more common letters among the remaining. Common remaining letters: T, O, I, S, L, U, D, G, etc.

 Another word: ""GHOUL"" has G, H, O, U, L.

 Or ""SOLID"": S, O, L, I, D.

 However, note that we must avoid C,R,A,N,E. ""SOLID"" uses S, O, L, I, D — none of the excluded letters.

 Let's go with ""SOLID"". It uses common consonants and two vowels (O and I) that we haven't tried.

 Alternatively, ""TOILS"" is also an option.

 But to maximize the chance of getting a hit, let's pick a word that has letters that are frequent in 5-letter words without C,R,A,N,E.

 Another candidate: ""MUSTY"", but Y is less common.

 How about ""PIOUS""? P, I, O, U, S. That also avoids the excluded letters.

 After considering, I'll choose ""SOLID"" because it covers S, O, L, I, D — all common.

 But wait, we haven't tried T? T is a very common letter. Maybe we should include T.

 Since T is common, let me pick a word with T. How about ""TULIP""? T, U, L, I, P — avoids the excluded letters.

 Or ""STOMP"" — S, T, O, M, P.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can cover more letters.

 However, the ideal is to get as much information as possible. So let's pick a word that uses new letters and includes T.

 Consider ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S — that uses T, O, I, L, S. That also avoids the excluded letters.

 I think ""TOILS"" is a good choice because it uses common letters that haven't been tried.

 But we can also consider ""POINT"", but that has P, O, I, N, T — but N was excluded! Remember, N is in the excluded list because we got N(x) from crane. So avoid N.

 Therefore, ""POINT"" is invalid because it has N.

 Similarly, ""STAND"" has S, T, A, N, D — A and N are excluded.

 So we must choose a word without C,R,A,N,E.

 ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S — none of the excluded. This seems valid.

 Another word: ""BUOYS"" — B, U, O, Y, S — but B and Y are new? Yes, but Y might be less common. Still, it's an option.

 I think ""TOILS"" is a better choice because T and S are very common and O and I are common vowels.

 So I will go with ""TOILS"".

 But note: we are using S and L which are common. However, I think ""SOUTH"" is another option: S, O, U, T, H — avoids excluded letters.

 Maybe ""SOUTH"" has H which we haven't tried.

 Actually, both are fine. But I'll go with ""SOUTH"" because it introduces U and H.

 After reconsideration, I'll choose ""SOUTH"" to cover S, O, U, T, H — five new letters.

 But wait, in the first guess we had E and A eliminated? Actually, we only eliminated C,R,A,N,E. The secret word must not contain any of these.

 Therefore, the secret word is made from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

 Let's pick ""SOUTH"".

<guess>south</guess> 

 I think that's a good second guess.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane,"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), the secret word contains none of these letters. Therefore, the next guess must avoid C, R, A, N, E entirely and introduce new letters to gather more information. 

After eliminating those letters, common remaining letters include T, S, L, O, H, and U. A strong second guess should prioritize high-frequency consonants and vowels not yet tested. The word **""SOUTH""** fits well because:
- It uses 5 new letters (S, O, U, T, H).
- It includes common consonants (S, T, H) and vowels (O, U).
- If any letter matches (either positionally or in the wrong position), it will narrow down possibilities significantly.

This approach maximizes information gain for subsequent guesses.

P, I, O, U, S. That also avoids the excluded letters.\n\n After considering, I\'ll choose ""SOLID"" because it covers S, O, L, I, D — all common.\n\n But wait, we haven\'t tried T? T is a very common letter. Maybe we should include T.\n\n Since T is common, let me pick a word with T. How about ""TULIP""? T, U, L, I, P — avoids the excluded letters.\n\n Or ""STOMP"" — S, T, O, M, P.\n\n But note: we have 6 tries, so we can cover more letters.\n\n However, the ideal is to get as much information as possible. So let\'s pick a word that uses new letters and includes T.\n\n Consider ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S — that uses T, O, I, L, S. That also avoids the excluded letters.\n\n I think ""TOILS"" is a good choice because it uses common letters that haven\'t been tried.\n\n But we can also consider ""POINT"", but that has P, O, I, N, T — but N was excluded! Remember, N is in the excluded list because we got N(x) from crane. So avoid N.\n\n Therefore, ""POINT"" is invalid because it has N.\n\n Similarly, ""STAND"" has S, T, A, N, D — A and N are excluded.\n\n So we must choose a word without C,R,A,N,E.\n\n ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S — none of the excluded. This seems valid.\n\n Another word: ""BUOYS"" — B, U, O, Y, S — but B and Y are new? Yes, but Y might be less common. Still, it\'s an option.\n\n I think ""TOILS"" is a better choice because T and S are very common and O and I are common vowels.\n\n So I will go with ""TOILS"".\n\n But note: we are using S and L which are common. However, I think ""SOUTH"" is another option: S, O, U, T, H — avoids excluded letters.\n\n Maybe ""SOUTH"" has H which we haven\'t tried.\n\n Actually, both are fine. But I\'ll go with ""SOUTH"" because it introduces U and H.\n\n After reconsideration, I\'ll choose ""SOUTH"" to cover S, O, U, T, H — five new letters.\n\n But wait, in the first guess we had E and A eliminated? Actually, we only eliminated C,R,A,N,E. The secret word must not contain any of these.\n\n Therefore, the secret word is made from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.\n\n Let\'s pick ""SOUTH"".\n\n<guess>south</guess> \n\n I think that\'s a good second guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane,"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), the secret word contains none of these letters. Therefore, the next guess must avoid C, R, A, N, E entirely and introduce new letters to gather more information. \n\nAfter eliminating those letters, common remaining letters include T, S, L, O, H, and U. A strong second guess should prioritize high-frequency consonants and vowels not yet tested. The word **""SOUTH""** fits well because:\n- It uses 5 new letters (S, O, U, T, H).\n- It includes common consonants (S, T, H) and vowels (O, U).\n- If any letter matches (either positionally or in the wrong position), it will narrow down possibilities significantly.\n\nThis approach maximizes information gain for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>south</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: south -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(x) U(x) T(-) H(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from two guesses:
1. crane: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x) → none of these letters are in the secret word.
2. south: S(x), O(x), U(x), T(-), H(-) → T is in the word but in the wrong position, H is also in the word but in the wrong position. S, O, U are not in the word.

From the feedback, we know:
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, O, U.
- It contains T and H, but not in the positions we guessed. In ""south"", T was in the 4th position and H was in the 5th position, so the secret word has T and H but not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively.

Since we have T and H in the word, and we have eliminated many letters, let's think about possible words.

Letters that have been eliminated: C, R, A, N, E, S, O, U. So the remaining letters are:
B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we also have T and H in the word, which we now know are present.

The secret word has 5 letters, including T and H, and three more from the remaining set.

Also, we know that T is not in the 4th position (since in ""south"", position 4 was T and it was marked '-', meaning present but wrong spot). Similarly, H is not in the 5th position.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Does not use any eliminated letters: so must use only B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, and also we know T and H are included? Wait, we can use T and H again in our guess? Actually, we can. But note, we know T and H are in the word, so it's good to include them to check positions.

However, in our guess we also want to test new letters to get more information.

But since we know T and H are in the word, we must place them in different positions to find the correct ones.

In our next guess:
- We must include T and H (because they are in the word) but place them in positions different from the 4th and 5th.
- We cannot use any of the eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,O,U.
- We have 6 tries, so we can still try to cover new letters.

List of allowed letters: B,D,F,G,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z and T,H (which are known present).

But wait, T and H are known to be present, so we have two known letters and need to guess the remaining three.

Our guess should include T and H and three new letters from the remaining set.

We also need to avoid the positions we already know are wrong for T and H. Specifically, T cannot be in position 4 and H cannot be in position 5. Also, in our previous guess ""south"", we placed T in position 4 and H in position 5, and both were marked '-' meaning present but wrong positions. So in the secret word, T is not in position 4 and H is not in position 5.

Moreover, since S,O,U were absent, they don't appear.

Now, possible positions for T: it can be in positions 1,2,3 (since position 4 is wrong and we don't know about others). Similarly, H can be in positions 1,2,3,4 (since position 5 is wrong).

But note, if we are to include T and H in our guess, we should try them in positions we haven't tested. For example, we haven't tried T in positions 1,2,3 or H in positions 1,2,3,4.

However, we have to form a valid English word.

We must also consider that the secret word could have additional repeated letters? But in Wordle, letters can repeat. However, the feedback doesn't specify if repeated letters are handled differently. In standard Wordle, if a letter is repeated and the secret has it once, the extra one might be marked as absent. But since in our first two guesses we didn't have repeats, we don't know. So we assume we don't get repeated letters until forced.

Given the constraints, we try to form a word that includes T and H and three new letters.

What are some candidate words?

Let me try to think of words that have T and H and three letters from B,D,F,G,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Example words:
- LIGHT: L,I,G,H,T. But G,H,T are in candidate list? Let's check: L is allowed, I is allowed, G is allowed, H and T are known present. So LIGHT uses L,I,G,H,T.

But note the positions: in LIGHT, H is the 4th letter and T is the 5th letter. But we know that H cannot be in the 5th position? No, wait: in ""south"", H was in the 5th position and was marked '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So H cannot be at position 5? Actually, yes: the feedback for H was '-' meaning present but wrong position — and since we placed H at position 5, it means H is not at position 5. Similarly, T is not at position 4.

So for ""LIGHT"", if we set H at position 4? Actually, we are allowed to put H at position 4? Yes, because only position 5 has been ruled out for H. Similarly, T can be at position 5? Because we only know T is not at position 4.

In ""LIGHT"": 
- H is at position 4? 
- T is at position 5? 

But position 5 for T: we have not tested T in position 5. Similarly, H at position 4: we have not tested that.

So we can use ""LIGHT"". But let's see the structure.

Alternatively, we can arrange differently. However, we must use only allowed letters.

Another word: WITHY — W,I,T,H,Y. That has W,I,T,H,Y. But W,Y are allowed? Yes.

But WITHY has two Ws? No, it's W,I,T,H,Y — distinct? Yes, but Y is at the end.

But is WITHY a valid word? Yes, it means willow trees or something. But less common.

Another word: NIGHT? But N is eliminated — from crane, N(x). So we cannot use N.

Similarly, LIGHT seems acceptable.

But we have eliminated S,O,U already, so LIGHT is fine.

Another word: MIGHT — M,I,G,H,T. Also valid.

Similarly, TIGHT? T,I,G,H,T — has two Ts? But that might be valid? However, we don't know if the secret word has two Ts. But the word TIGHT has T repeated? T-I-G-H-T: two Ts. But we don't know about duplicates.

To avoid complexity, let's stick with words without duplicates for now.

So MIGHT: M,I,G,H,T — all distinct and allowed letters.

But note: we need to avoid positions that we know are incorrect for T and H.

In MIGHT: 
- T is in position 5? We haven't tested T in position 5, but we know T is not in position 4. Position 5 is new, so it might be correct.
- H is in position 4? We haven't tested H at position 4. Previously, we tested position 5 for H and it was wrong. So H at position 4 might be correct.

Thus, ""MIGHT"" could be a candidate.

But we also want to test new letters. In MIGHT, we introduce M,I,G — which are new.

Alternatively, we could try H in a different position, like position 1 or 2.

For example, a word that starts with H: Using allowed letters and includes T.

How about HITCH? H,I,T,C,H — but wait, C is eliminated (from crane: C(x)). So we cannot use C.

Another: HIGHT? Not common, and has G,H,I,T? H-I-G-H-T? But two Hs? Avoid.

Another option: THYME — T,H,Y,M,E — but E is eliminated? We cannot use E.

So THYME is invalid.

Other H- words: HIPPO, but double P and O is eliminated? O is eliminated.

Perhaps we should try H at position 1 and T at a different position.

Word: HINGE? Has N and E, eliminated.

Not possible. So H at position 1 might be difficult.

Alternatively, H at position 2: for example, WHITE? W,H,I,T,E — E eliminated. Not good.

Another: THING? But N is eliminated.

Seems tricky. So perhaps words with H at 4 or T at 5 might be easier.

But we have LIGHT and MIGHT as options. Both are valid and common.

We could also try T in the middle.

Another word: FIGHT — F,I,G,H,T. Also good.

But similarly, FIGHT places H at 4 and T at 5.

In FIGHT, H is 4th and T is 5th.

We can test these positions: if the secret word has H at 4th, we would get a ✓ for H at 4th? Or if T at 5th, ✓.

But if we get -, then we know that H isn't at 4th and T isn't at 5th.

So we can get positional information.

Moreover, the secret word might have T or H at other positions.

So to recap: we need to guess a word that includes T and H, avoids eliminated letters, and places T not at 4 and H not at 5. But we can place them anywhere else.

Therefore, I'll choose ""MIGHT"" because it introduces new letters M, I, and G.

We can also consider words that place T and H in other positions, but since we don't have many words without eliminating letters, MIGHT is fine.

Wait, but in the feedback, we have T in the 4th position was wrong? So in MIGHT, if we put T at 5th and H at 4th, and if the secret has H at 4th or T at 5th, we would get a ✓, which would be good. If not, we get '-' for both and still move forward.

Thus, we'll go with ""MIGHT"".

But note: we have to confirm if M,I,G are allowed — yes, not eliminated.

So guess: MIGHT

Alternatively, we could try a word that has T and H not at end? For example, with T at beginning? How about THUMB? T,H,U,M,B — but U is eliminated? From south: U(x). So we cannot use U.

So it's hard to get T and H at the start.

Therefore, MIGHT seems reasonable.

Another word: LITHS? But that is less common and means stone monuments? Also, it has L,I,T,H,S — S is eliminated? From south: S(x), so we cannot use S.

No, S is eliminated.

So yes, stick with MIGHT.

Guess: MIGHT

But let's confirm the positions:
M I G H T
Positions: 1:M, 2:I, 3:G, 4:H, 5:T

H is in position 4 — not 5? We are avoiding H at 5, but position 4 was not tested for H? Previously we only tested H at 5 (which was wrong). So we can test H at position 4? Yes.

Similarly, T is now at position 5 — and we previously tested T at position 4 (which was wrong). So position 5 is new for T.

Thus, both positions for H and T are different from the ones we know are wrong.

So that's acceptable.

We expect that if the secret word has H at position 4 or T at position 5, we would get a ✓, which would be helpful. Otherwise, we get '-' for both and learn that neither is in those positions.

Also, we are testing M, I, G: if any of these are in the word (and position) relevant? If M at position 1, etc.

So we proceed.

Therefore, our next guess is ""MIGHT"".

Based on the previous feedback:
- First guess ""crane"" eliminated C, R, A, N, E (all marked absent).
- Second guess ""south"" eliminated S, O, U (all absent), but confirmed T and H are present in the word, though not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

### Key Insights:
1. **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, O, U cannot be in the secret word.
2. **Included letters**: T and H are confirmed in the word but not in positions 4 and 5.
3. **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus T and H).
4. **Strategy for next guess**:
   - Must include T and H to test their correct positions.
   - Avoid placing T at position 4 or H at position 5, as these are already ruled out.
   - Introduce new high-frequency consonants (e.g., M, G) and vowels (e.g., I) to maximize information gain.
   - Prioritize common English words to ensure validity.

### Candidate Selection:
- **""MIGHT""** is chosen because:
  - Contains T and H (required inclusions).
  - Uses new letters: M, I, G (all high-frequency among remaining options).
  - Positions: T is placed at position 5 (new, untested position) and H at position 4 (new, untested position).
    - If T is in position 5, it will show ✓; if H is in position 4, it will show ✓; otherwise, ""-"" will provide positional clues.
  - Avoids excluded letters and conforms to English word rules.
- Other options considered and rejected:
  - ""LIGHT"": Similar, but MIGHT is slightly more common.
  - ""FIGHT"": Valid, but ""MIGHT"" introduces M, which is more frequent than F.
  - Words with T/H at the beginning (e.g., ""THUMB"") were impractical due to letter restrictions.

This guess will efficiently narrow down possible letters and positions for subsequent attempts.

<guess>might</guess>",might,"We are given feedback from two guesses:
1. crane: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x) → none of these letters are in the secret word.

- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, O, U.
- It contains T and H, but not in the positions we guessed. In ""south"", T was in the 4th position and H was in the 5th position, so the secret word has T and H but not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively.

Now, possible positions for T: it can be in positions 1,2,3 (since position 4 is wrong and we don't know about others). Similarly, H can be in positions 1,2,3,4 (since position 5 is wrong).

But note, if we are to include T and H in our guess, we should try them in positions we haven't tested. For example, we haven't tried T in positions 1,2,3 or H in positions 1,2,3,4.

    - If T is in position 5, it will show ✓; if H is in position 4, it will show ✓; otherwise, ""-"" will provide positional clues.
  - Avoids excluded letters and conforms to English word rules.
- Other options considered and rejected:
  - ""LIGHT"": Similar, but MIGHT is slightly more common.
  - ""FIGHT"": Valid, but ""MIGHT"" introduces M, which is more frequent than F.
  - Words with T/H at the beginning (e.g., ""THUMB"") were impractical due to letter restrictions.

This guess will efficiently narrow down possible letters and positions for subsequent attempts.",Guess 3: might -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) I(✓) G(✓) H(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
