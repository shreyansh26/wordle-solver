We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

This tells us:
- The letter E is in the word and is in the 5th position (since it's the last letter of ""crane"" and got a check).
- The letter A is in the word, but not in the 3rd position (because ""crane"" has A at position 3 and it got a minus).
- The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- E at the 5th position.
- A somewhere, but not in the 3rd position. It could be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Since A is present and not in position 3, and E is fixed at position 5, we can think of words that have A and E (with E at the end).

We must avoid using C, R, and N because they are not in the word.

Now, for the next guess, we want to test other common letters and also try to find the position for A.

We could try a word that:
- Ends with E (since E is fixed at position 5).
- Contains A in a different position (not position 3 and not in the same position as the previous A to test a new spot).
- Avoids C, R, N.

Also, we should include other common letters that we haven't tested yet to gather more information.

Common letters not yet tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, etc.

Since A is in the word, but we don't know where, we can try placing A in position 1 or 2 or 4.

Let's try to put A in position 1 for this guess, while keeping E at the end.

One common word is ""SAUTE"". This word has:
- S: untested
- A at position 1
- U: untested
- T: untested
- E at position 5 (fixed)

But note: we are also avoiding C, R, N, so S, U, T are okay.

However, we must consider the possibility that A might not be at position 1, but this guess will help us rule that in or out.

Another idea: we could try placing A in position 4, with words like ""PLATE"" but P and L are untested. Also note we have to avoid R, so plate has no R? Actually we know R is absent so that's okay? Wait, feedback for R was x, so R is not in the word? So indeed, avoid R.

But let me double-check: In the first guess, R was at position 2 and got an x, meaning R is not anywhere in the word. So we must avoid R.

So, word ""saute"" does not contain R, and avoids C, R, N. It also has E at the end.

If we guess ""saute"":
- If A gets a ✓ then we know A is at position 1. If A gets a - then we know A is not at position 1 but still in the word (so must be at position 2 or 4). It can't be at position 3 because from the first guess we know at position 3 it wasn't present (but actually the first guess had A at position 3 and got a minus meaning A is present but not there, so positions 1,2,4 are possible).

Alternatively, we could try a word with A in position 2? Like ""PASTE""? But that has P, A at 2, S, T, E.

But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another common word might be ""LEAST"", but it has L, E (at position 5 is fixed but we are putting E at 5? Actually LEAST has E at the end? Wait, LEAST is L,E,A,S,T -> positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T -> no E at the end? So we cannot use that because we know E is fixed at position 5. So the word must end with E.

Therefore, we need a word that ends with E.

So options: 5-letter words ending in E and containing A (in positions 1,2, or 4).

Examples:
- A in position 1: AGATE, ABASE, etc. But let's avoid using letters we know are bad? We know C,R,N are bad. So AGATE? A, G, A, T, E -> but A repeated? We don't mind repetition if valid. But we can try.

But we also want to test new letters.

Similarly, A in position 4: words like BLARE, but we know R is bad so BLARE has R -> must avoid.

So BLAME? B-L-A-M-E -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:M, 5:E -> but A is at position 3? But remember our first guess had A at position 3 and got a minus meaning that A is not at position 3? Exactly! Because in ""CRANE"", A was at position 3 and it was marked as '-' meaning present but wrong position. That means in the secret word, A is present but not at position 3. So in BLAME, we are putting A at position 3 again, which we know is incorrect? Actually, we are allowed to put A there again? But it might give us a minus again? That wouldn't tell us anything new? Except that if we put A at position 3 and get a minus again, we don't learn anything. We already know it's not position 3.

Therefore, we should avoid putting A in position 3 because we know it's wrong. The feedback for A was a minus meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So we can try A at other positions.

So let's try A at position 1 (like in ""AGATE"") or position 2 (like in ""PLATE"" but position 2 would be for PLATE: P-L-A-T-E -> A is in position 3? That's the same as above.

Wait, PLATE: P-L-A-T-E -> A is at index 3 (if we start at 1: P=1, L=2, A=3, T=4, E=5). And we know position 3 is bad for A.

So what about words with A at position 4? For example, ""CAUSE""? But C is already known to be absent? So CAUSE has C -> not allowed.

What about ""SAUCE""? Also has C -> bad.

How about ""PAUSE"": P-A-U-S-E -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:U, 4:S, 5:E -> so A is at position 2? That's acceptable.

Also, ""STARE""? But R is absent? STARE has R -> bad.

So ""PAUSE"" is a candidate: P, A at position 2, U, S, E at position 5.

Similarly, ""SLATE"": S-L-A-T-E -> A at position 3? Again, bad.

What about ""HASTE"": H-A-S-T-E -> A at position 2? That works.

But we don't know if H is in the word? That's what we test.

Wait, we know E is at position 5, so words ending in E.

List: 
- with A at position 1: AGATE, ABASE, AWAKE, ADAGE, etc. But avoid C,R,N.
- with A at position 2: BASTE, TASTE, PASTE? Wait, PASTE: P,A,S,T,E -> A at position 2? Yes. Similarly, MAIZE, but might be less common? Also has Z which is less common.

Another: PLACE? No C? PLACE has C and E? But C is bad? PLACE ends with E? Place: P L A C E -> so C at position 4? And we know C is bad -> avoid.

So acceptable words: 
For A at position 1: AGATE (A,G,A,T,E) -> possible? A repeated? Actually, double A? That's okay. But we are testing G and T. Also, if the secret word has only one A, then if we have A at position 1, if it's correct we get ✓ for that A. But since there is a double A in AGATE, the feedback might show both A's? However, we only have one A in the secret word presumably? We don't know. But the word AGATE has A at positions 1 and 3? Position 3 is bad? We know position 3 is bad for A? Actually, we have A at position 1 and 3? We avoid position 3? Because we know position 3 is not correct. So then AGATE might be bad because we are putting A at position 3 again? But the feedback for position 3 might not be helpful? It will tell us if A is there or not? But we already know there is an A, so putting it at position 3 will give minus? That doesn't tell us new positions.

Instead, we should try to put A in a new position: position 1 or 4? Position 4? Words with A at position 4.

For example, ""CAUSE"" has C -> bad.

""HOUSE"": H-O-U-S-E -> no A -> must exclude.

We must have A in the word. So for words ending in E and having A not in position 3? So position 1, 2, or 4.

Position 4? That is, letter in position 4 is A? Then words like ...A followed by E? For example, ...AE? But E is fixed at the end. So words ending in AE? But then position 4: A and 5: E. Words: BLARE? Has R -> bad. SHADE? H-A-D-E? But positions: S=? H=? A=? D=? E? Wait, SHADE: S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> A at position 3? Bad.

GLADE: G(1), L(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> A at 3? Bad.

FLAKE? F(1),L(2),A(3),K(4),E(5) -> A at 3? Bad.

So it's hard to find words with A at position 4 that are common? Because of the pattern? Words ending in AE? But in English, words with AE ending are rare? Except for proper nouns? Most common words are like CAFE? But CAFE has E at end? But A is at position 2? CAFE: C(1),A(2),F(3),E(4) -> wait 4 letters? Five letters: CAFÉ? But normally we consider CAFE as 5? No, CAFE is 4 letters? We need 5 letters. So not.

Other word? PLACE? Has C and A at position 3? Bad.

Perhaps we should focus on position 2 for A? 

So words with A at position 2 and ending in E? These are common? Like PASTE? PASTE: P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5). But note: position 3 is S? We don't care? And we avoid C,R,N? PASTE has no C,R,N? So acceptable.

Similarly, TASTE: T(1),A(2),S(3),T(4),E(5) -> T repeated? Might be okay? But less ideal? Because we are testing fewer letters?

Similarly, BASTE: B(1),A(2),S(3),T(4),E(5).

Another: HASTE: H(1),A(2),S(3),T(4),E(5).

Or WAIVE: W(1),A(2),I(3),V(4),E(5)? But W is less common? WAIVE is valid.

Or GAUZE? G(1),A(2),U(3),Z(4),E(5) -> U? Z? But less common.

So PASTE, HASTE, BASTE, TASTE? All acceptable.

Now among these, we can pick one. Also, want to test new letters? The new letters in PASTE: P, A, S, T, E -> but E we already know? So testing P, S, T, and also A at position 2.

Similarly, HASTE: H, S, T.

Same for others.

What about ""SAUTE""? That we thought earlier? SAUTE: S(1),A(2),U(3),T(4),E(5) -> A at position 2? Actually, SAUTE is S-A-U-T-E -> position 2 is A? No: position 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:T, 5:E? So A at position 2? And S,U,T.

SAUTE has no C,R,N.

I think SAUTE is a good choice because it tests S,A,U,T,E? But E is known? But we put it again? That's okay? Actually, it will confirm E at position 5? Although we know? But it can help? But we are forced to put E at the end? So we don't test E again? We are testing the other letters.

Therefore, let's go with ""saute"".

So our next guess: SAUTE

This way:
- If A is at position 2, then we get A(✓) and we're happy? But note: A might be elsewhere? Actually, no, we are testing position 2? So if A is at position 2 then ✓? If not, then minus? And we know it's present? So it tells us if position 2 is correct or not? If minus then A is in the word but not at position 2? Then it must be at position 1 or 4? But position 4 we have T? So we can see.

Also, we test S, U, T.

Which of these can reveal new letters? 

Alternatively, we could choose PASTE: tests P and S,T? Or TASTE: T,A,S,T,E? Then T tested twice? Not ideal? Because we have a repeated T? Maybe avoid? Unless the first T is at position 1? And second at 4? 

But SAUTE has all unique letters: S, A, U, T, E -> good.

Therefore, I think SAUTE is a strong candidate.

So guess: SAUTE

But let me confirm spelling? SAUTE is a valid English word? Yes? As in cooking term? Saute.

So we'll go with that.

Think step by step: 

We have to include E at the end? Yes? Because we know E is at position 5? So SAUTE ends with E? Good.

Also avoids C, R, N? Good.

Tests S, A (at position 2?), U, T? Good.

So feedback from SAUTE will tell us:
- S at position 1: could be x, ✓ or -? 
- A at position 2: ✓ or -? Because we know A is in the word? So either ✓ or -? But if A is at position 1, then S might be something? Actually, we don't know? But the symbols will tell.

Hence, I choose SAUTE.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is in the correct position (5th letter).
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- C, R, and N are not in the word.

For the second guess:
- The word must end with E (position 5).
- Must include A, but not in position 3.
- Avoid C, R, and N.
- Test new common letters like S, T, U to gather more information.

I selected ""saute"" because:
- It ends with E (satisfying the known E position).
- Places A in position 2 (a new position to test after the 3rd position was ruled out).
- Uses new letters S, U, T (common vowels/consonants not tested).
- Avoids C, R, N.

This choice efficiently explores possible positions for A and tests multiple new letters.

<guess>saute</guess>",saute,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

This tells us:
- The letter E is in the word and is in the 5th position (since it's the last letter of ""crane"" and got a check).
- The letter A is in the word, but not in the 3rd position (because ""crane"" has A at position 3 and it got a minus).
- The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- E at the 5th position.
- A somewhere, but not in the 3rd position. It could be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Since A is present and not in position 3, and E is fixed at position 5, we can think of words that have A and E (with E at the end).

We must avoid using C, R, and N because they are not in the word.

Now, for the next guess, we want to test other common letters and also try to find the position for A.

We could try a word that:
- Ends with E (since E is fixed at position 5).
- Contains A in a different position (not position 3 and not in the same position as the previous A to test a new spot).
- Avoids C, R, N.

Also, we should include other common letters that we haven't tested yet to gather more information.

Common letters not yet tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, etc.

Since A is in the word, but we don't know where, we can try placing A in position 1 or 2 or 4.

Let's try to put A in position 1 for this guess, while keeping E at the end.

One common word is ""SAUTE"". This word has:
- S: untested
- A at position 1
- U: untested
- T: untested
- E at position 5 (fixed)

But note: we are also avoiding C, R, N, so S, U, T are okay.

However, we must consider the possibility that A might not be at position 1, but this guess will help us rule that in or out.

Another idea: we could try placing A in position 4, with words like ""PLATE"" but P and L are untested. Also note we have to avoid R, so plate has no R? Actually we know R is absent so that's okay? Wait, feedback for R was x, so R is not in the word? So indeed, avoid R.

But let me double-check: In the first guess, R was at position 2 and got an x, meaning R is not anywhere in the word. So we must avoid R.

So, word ""saute"" does not contain R, and avoids C, R, N. It also has E at the end.

If we guess ""saute"":
- If A gets a ✓ then we know A is at position 1. If A gets a - then we know A is not at position 1 but still in the word (so must be at position 2 or 4). It can't be at position 3 because from the first guess we know at position 3 it wasn't present (but actually the first guess had A at position 3 and got a minus meaning A is present but not there, so positions 1,2,4 are possible).

Alternatively, we could try a word with A in position 2? Like ""PASTE""? But that has P, A at 2, S, T, E.

But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another common word might be ""LEAST"", but it has L, E (at position 5 is fixed but we are putting E at 5? Actually LEAST has E at the end? Wait, LEAST is L,E,A,S,T -> positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T -> no E at the end? So we cannot use that because we know E is fixed at position 5. So the word must end with E.

Therefore, we need a word that ends with E.

So options: 5-letter words ending in E and containing A (in positions 1,2, or 4).

Examples:
- A in position 1: AGATE, ABASE, etc. But let's avoid using letters we know are bad? We know C,R,N are bad. So AGATE? A, G, A, T, E -> but A repeated? We don't mind repetition if valid. But we can try.

But we also want to test new letters.

Similarly, A in position 4: words like BLARE, but we know R is bad so BLARE has R -> must avoid.

So BLAME? B-L-A-M-E -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:M, 5:E -> but A is at position 3? But remember our first guess had A at position 3 and got a minus meaning that A is not at position 3? Exactly! Because in ""CRANE"", A was at position 3 and it was marked as '-' meaning present but wrong position. That means in the secret word, A is present but not at position 3. So in BLAME, we are putting A at position 3 again, which we know is incorrect? Actually, we are allowed to put A there again? But it might give us a minus again? That wouldn't tell us anything new? Except that if we put A at position 3 and get a minus again, we don't learn anything. We already know it's not position 3.

Therefore, we should avoid putting A in position 3 because we know it's wrong. The feedback for A was a minus meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So we can try A at other positions.

So let's try A at position 1 (like in ""AGATE"") or position 2 (like in ""PLATE"" but position 2 would be for PLATE: P-L-A-T-E -> A is in position 3? That's the same as above.

Wait, PLATE: P-L-A-T-E -> A is at index 3 (if we start at 1: P=1, L=2, A=3, T=4, E=5). And we know position 3 is bad for A.

So what about words with A at position 4? For example, ""CAUSE""? But C is already known to be absent? So CAUSE has C -> not allowed.

What about ""SAUCE""? Also has C -> bad.

How about ""PAUSE"": P-A-U-S-E -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:U, 4:S, 5:E -> so A is at position 2? That's acceptable.

Also, ""STARE""? But R is absent? STARE has R -> bad.

So ""PAUSE"" is a candidate: P, A at position 2, U, S, E at position 5.

Similarly, ""SLATE"": S-L-A-T-E -> A at position 3? Again, bad.

What about ""HASTE"": H-A-S-T-E -> A at position 2? That works.

But we don't know if H is in the word? That's what we test.

Wait, we know E is at position 5, so words ending in E.

List: 
- with A at position 1: AGATE, ABASE, AWAKE, ADAGE, etc. But avoid C,R,N.
- with A at position 2: BASTE, TASTE, PASTE? Wait, PASTE: P,A,S,T,E -> A at position 2? Yes. Similarly, MAIZE, but might be less common? Also has Z which is less common.

Another: PLACE? No C? PLACE has C and E? But C is bad? PLACE ends with E? Place: P L A C E -> so C at position 4? And we know C is bad -> avoid.

So acceptable words: 
For A at position 1: AGATE (A,G,A,T,E) -> possible? A repeated? Actually, double A? That's okay. But we are testing G and T. Also, if the secret word has only one A, then if we have A at position 1, if it's correct we get ✓ for that A. But since there is a double A in AGATE, the feedback might show both A's? However, we only have one A in the secret word presumably? We don't know. But the word AGATE has A at positions 1 and 3? Position 3 is bad? We know position 3 is bad for A? Actually, we have A at position 1 and 3? We avoid position 3? Because we know position 3 is not correct. So then AGATE might be bad because we are putting A at position 3 again? But the feedback for position 3 might not be helpful? It will tell us if A is there or not? But we already know there is an A, so putting it at position 3 will give minus? That doesn't tell us new positions.

Instead, we should try to put A in a new position: position 1 or 4? Position 4? Words with A at position 4.

For example, ""CAUSE"" has C -> bad.

""HOUSE"": H-O-U-S-E -> no A -> must exclude.

We must have A in the word. So for words ending in E and having A not in position 3? So position 1, 2, or 4.

Position 4? That is, letter in position 4 is A? Then words like ...A followed by E? For example, ...AE? But E is fixed at the end. So words ending in AE? But then position 4: A and 5: E. Words: BLARE? Has R -> bad. SHADE? H-A-D-E? But positions: S=? H=? A=? D=? E? Wait, SHADE: S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> A at position 3? Bad.

GLADE: G(1), L(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> A at 3? Bad.

FLAKE? F(1),L(2),A(3),K(4),E(5) -> A at 3? Bad.

So it's hard to find words with A at position 4 that are common? Because of the pattern? Words ending in AE? But in English, words with AE ending are rare? Except for proper nouns? Most common words are like CAFE? But CAFE has E at end? But A is at position 2? CAFE: C(1),A(2),F(3),E(4) -> wait 4 letters? Five letters: CAFÉ? But normally we consider CAFE as 5? No, CAFE is 4 letters? We need 5 letters. So not.

Other word? PLACE? Has C and A at position 3? Bad.

Perhaps we should focus on position 2 for A? 

So words with A at position 2 and ending in E? These are common? Like PASTE? PASTE: P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5). But note: position 3 is S? We don't care? And we avoid C,R,N? PASTE has no C,R,N? So acceptable.

Similarly, TASTE: T(1),A(2),S(3),T(4),E(5) -> T repeated? Might be okay? But less ideal? Because we are testing fewer letters?

Similarly, BASTE: B(1),A(2),S(3),T(4),E(5).

Another: HASTE: H(1),A(2),S(3),T(4),E(5).

Or WAIVE: W(1),A(2),I(3),V(4),E(5)? But W is less common? WAIVE is valid.

Or GAUZE? G(1),A(2),U(3),Z(4),E(5) -> U? Z? But less common.

So PASTE, HASTE, BASTE, TASTE? All acceptable.

Now among these, we can pick one. Also, want to test new letters? The new letters in PASTE: P, A, S, T, E -> but E we already know? So testing P, S, T, and also A at position 2.

Similarly, HASTE: H, S, T.

Same for others.

What about ""SAUTE""? That we thought earlier? SAUTE: S(1),A(2),U(3),T(4),E(5) -> A at position 2? Actually, SAUTE is S-A-U-T-E -> position 2 is A? No: position 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:T, 5:E? So A at position 2? And S,U,T.

SAUTE has no C,R,N.

I think SAUTE is a good choice because it tests S,A,U,T,E? But E is known? But we put it again? That's okay? Actually, it will confirm E at position 5? Although we know? But it can help? But we are forced to put E at the end? So we don't test E again? We are testing the other letters.

Therefore, let's go with ""saute"".

So our next guess: SAUTE

This way:
- If A is at position 2, then we get A(✓) and we're happy? But note: A might be elsewhere? Actually, no, we are testing position 2? So if A is at position 2 then ✓? If not, then minus? And we know it's present? So it tells us if position 2 is correct or not? If minus then A is in the word but not at position 2? Then it must be at position 1 or 4? But position 4 we have T? So we can see.

Also, we test S, U, T.

Which of these can reveal new letters? 

Alternatively, we could choose PASTE: tests P and S,T? Or TASTE: T,A,S,T,E? Then T tested twice? Not ideal? Because we have a repeated T? Maybe avoid? Unless the first T is at position 1? And second at 4? 

But SAUTE has all unique letters: S, A, U, T, E -> good.

Therefore, I think SAUTE is a strong candidate.

So guess: SAUTE

But let me confirm spelling? SAUTE is a valid English word? Yes? As in cooking term? Saute.

So we'll go with that.

Think step by step: 

We have to include E at the end? Yes? Because we know E is at position 5? So SAUTE ends with E? Good.

Also avoids C, R, N? Good.

Tests S, A (at position 2?), U, T? Good.

So feedback from SAUTE will tell us:
- S at position 1: could be x, ✓ or -? 
- A at position 2: ✓ or -? Because we know A is in the word? So either ✓ or -? But if A is at position 1, then S might be something? Actually, we don't know? But the symbols will tell.

Hence, I choose SAUTE.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is in the correct position (5th letter).
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- C, R, and N are not in the word.

For the second guess:
- The word must end with E (position 5).
- Must include A, but not in position 3.
- Avoid C, R, and N.
- Test new common letters like S, T, U to gather more information.

I selected ""saute"" because:
- It ends with E (satisfying the known E position).
- Places A in position 2 (a new position to test after the 3rd position was ruled out).
- Uses new letters S, U, T (common vowels/consonants not tested).
- Avoids C, R, N.

This choice efficiently explores possible positions for A and tests multiple new letters.",Guess 2: saute -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,above,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word that includes common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

This tells us:
- The letter E is in the word and is in the 5th position (since it's the last letter of ""crane"" and got a check).
- The letter A is in the word, but not in the 3rd position (because ""crane"" has A at position 3 and it got a minus).
- The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- E at the 5th position.
- A somewhere, but not in the 3rd position. It could be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Since A is present and not in position 3, and E is fixed at position 5, we can think of words that have A and E (with E at the end).

We must avoid using C, R, and N because they are not in the word.

Now, for the next guess, we want to test other common letters and also try to find the position for A.

We could try a word that:
- Ends with E (since E is fixed at position 5).
- Contains A in a different position (not position 3 and not in the same position as the previous A to test a new spot).
- Avoids C, R, N.

Also, we should include other common letters that we haven't tested yet to gather more information.

Common letters not yet tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, etc.

Since A is in the word, but we don't know where, we can try placing A in position 1 or 2 or 4.

Let's try to put A in position 1 for this guess, while keeping E at the end.

One common word is ""SAUTE"". This word has:
- S: untested
- A at position 1
- U: untested
- T: untested
- E at position 5 (fixed)

But note: we are also avoiding C, R, N, so S, U, T are okay.

However, we must consider the possibility that A might not be at position 1, but this guess will help us rule that in or out.

Another idea: we could try placing A in position 4, with words like ""PLATE"" but P and L are untested. Also note we have to avoid R, so plate has no R? Actually we know R is absent so that's okay? Wait, feedback for R was x, so R is not in the word? So indeed, avoid R.

But let me double-check: In the first guess, R was at position 2 and got an x, meaning R is not anywhere in the word. So we must avoid R.

So, word ""saute"" does not contain R, and avoids C, R, N. It also has E at the end.

If we guess ""saute"":
- If A gets a ✓ then we know A is at position 1. If A gets a - then we know A is not at position 1 but still in the word (so must be at position 2 or 4). It can't be at position 3 because from the first guess we know at position 3 it wasn't present (but actually the first guess had A at position 3 and got a minus meaning A is present but not there, so positions 1,2,4 are possible).

Alternatively, we could try a word with A in position 2? Like ""PASTE""? But that has P, A at 2, S, T, E.

But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another common word might be ""LEAST"", but it has L, E (at position 5 is fixed but we are putting E at 5? Actually LEAST has E at the end? Wait, LEAST is L,E,A,S,T -> positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T -> no E at the end? So we cannot use that because we know E is fixed at position 5. So the word must end with E.

Therefore, we need a word that ends with E.

So options: 5-letter words ending in E and containing A (in positions 1,2, or 4).

Examples:
- A in position 1: AGATE, ABASE, etc. But let's avoid using letters we know are bad? We know C,R,N are bad. So AGATE? A, G, A, T, E -> but A repeated? We don't mind repetition if valid. But we can try.

But we also want to test new letters.

Similarly, A in position 4: words like BLARE, but we know R is bad so BLARE has R -> must avoid.

So BLAME? B-L-A-M-E -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:M, 5:E -> but A is at position 3? But remember our first guess had A at position 3 and got a minus meaning that A is not at position 3? Exactly! Because in ""CRANE"", A was at position 3 and it was marked as '-' meaning present but wrong position. That means in the secret word, A is present but not at position 3. So in BLAME, we are putting A at position 3 again, which we know is incorrect? Actually, we are allowed to put A there again? But it might give us a minus again? That wouldn't tell us anything new? Except that if we put A at position 3 and get a minus again, we don't learn anything. We already know it's not position 3.

Therefore, we should avoid putting A in position 3 because we know it's wrong. The feedback for A was a minus meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So we can try A at other positions.

So let's try A at position 1 (like in ""AGATE"") or position 2 (like in ""PLATE"" but position 2 would be for PLATE: P-L-A-T-E -> A is in position 3? That's the same as above.

Wait, PLATE: P-L-A-T-E -> A is at index 3 (if we start at 1: P=1, L=2, A=3, T=4, E=5). And we know position 3 is bad for A.

So what about words with A at position 4? For example, ""CAUSE""? But C is already known to be absent? So CAUSE has C -> not allowed.

What about ""SAUCE""? Also has C -> bad.

How about ""PAUSE"": P-A-U-S-E -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:U, 4:S, 5:E -> so A is at position 2? That's acceptable.

Also, ""STARE""? But R is absent? STARE has R -> bad.

So ""PAUSE"" is a candidate: P, A at position 2, U, S, E at position 5.

Similarly, ""SLATE"": S-L-A-T-E -> A at position 3? Again, bad.

What about ""HASTE"": H-A-S-T-E -> A at position 2? That works.

But we don't know if H is in the word? That's what we test.

Wait, we know E is at position 5, so words ending in E.

List: 
- with A at position 1: AGATE, ABASE, AWAKE, ADAGE, etc. But avoid C,R,N.
- with A at position 2: BASTE, TASTE, PASTE? Wait, PASTE: P,A,S,T,E -> A at position 2? Yes. Similarly, MAIZE, but might be less common? Also has Z which is less common.

Another: PLACE? No C? PLACE has C and E? But C is bad? PLACE ends with E? Place: P L A C E -> so C at position 4? And we know C is bad -> avoid.

So acceptable words: 
For A at position 1: AGATE (A,G,A,T,E) -> possible? A repeated? Actually, double A? That's okay. But we are testing G and T. Also, if the secret word has only one A, then if we have A at position 1, if it's correct we get ✓ for that A. But since there is a double A in AGATE, the feedback might show both A's? However, we only have one A in the secret word presumably? We don't know. But the word AGATE has A at positions 1 and 3? Position 3 is bad? We know position 3 is bad for A? Actually, we have A at position 1 and 3? We avoid position 3? Because we know position 3 is not correct. So then AGATE might be bad because we are putting A at position 3 again? But the feedback for position 3 might not be helpful? It will tell us if A is there or not? But we already know there is an A, so putting it at position 3 will give minus? That doesn't tell us new positions.

Instead, we should try to put A in a new position: position 1 or 4? Position 4? Words with A at position 4.

For example, ""CAUSE"" has C -> bad.

""HOUSE"": H-O-U-S-E -> no A -> must exclude.

We must have A in the word. So for words ending in E and having A not in position 3? So position 1, 2, or 4.

Position 4? That is, letter in position 4 is A? Then words like ...A followed by E? For example, ...AE? But E is fixed at the end. So words ending in AE? But then position 4: A and 5: E. Words: BLARE? Has R -> bad. SHADE? H-A-D-E? But positions: S=? H=? A=? D=? E? Wait, SHADE: S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> A at position 3? Bad.

GLADE: G(1), L(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> A at 3? Bad.

FLAKE? F(1),L(2),A(3),K(4),E(5) -> A at 3? Bad.

So it's hard to find words with A at position 4 that are common? Because of the pattern? Words ending in AE? But in English, words with AE ending are rare? Except for proper nouns? Most common words are like CAFE? But CAFE has E at end? But A is at position 2? CAFE: C(1),A(2),F(3),E(4) -> wait 4 letters? Five letters: CAFÉ? But normally we consider CAFE as 5? No, CAFE is 4 letters? We need 5 letters. So not.

Other word? PLACE? Has C and A at position 3? Bad.

Perhaps we should focus on position 2 for A? 

So words with A at position 2 and ending in E? These are common? Like PASTE? PASTE: P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5). But note: position 3 is S? We don't care? And we avoid C,R,N? PASTE has no C,R,N? So acceptable.

Similarly, TASTE: T(1),A(2),S(3),T(4),E(5) -> T repeated? Might be okay? But less ideal? Because we are testing fewer letters?

Similarly, BASTE: B(1),A(2),S(3),T(4),E(5).

Another: HASTE: H(1),A(2),S(3),T(4),E(5).

Or WAIVE: W(1),A(2),I(3),V(4),E(5)? But W is less common? WAIVE is valid.

Or GAUZE? G(1),A(2),U(3),Z(4),E(5) -> U? Z? But less common.

So PASTE, HASTE, BASTE, TASTE? All acceptable.

Now among these, we can pick one. Also, want to test new letters? The new letters in PASTE: P, A, S, T, E -> but E we already know? So testing P, S, T, and also A at position 2.

Similarly, HASTE: H, S, T.

Same for others.

What about ""SAUTE""? That we thought earlier? SAUTE: S(1),A(2),U(3),T(4),E(5) -> A at position 2? Actually, SAUTE is S-A-U-T-E -> position 2 is A? No: position 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:T, 5:E? So A at position 2? And S,U,T.

SAUTE has no C,R,N.

I think SAUTE is a good choice because it tests S,A,U,T,E? But E is known? But we put it again? That's okay? Actually, it will confirm E at position 5? Although we know? But it can help? But we are forced to put E at the end? So we don't test E again? We are testing the other letters.

Therefore, let's go with ""saute"".

So our next guess: SAUTE

This way:
- If A is at position 2, then we get A(✓) and we're happy? But note: A might be elsewhere? Actually, no, we are testing position 2? So if A is at position 2 then ✓? If not, then minus? And we know it's present? So it tells us if position 2 is correct or not? If minus then A is in the word but not at position 2? Then it must be at position 1 or 4? But position 4 we have T? So we can see.

Also, we test S, U, T.

Which of these can reveal new letters? 

Alternatively, we could choose PASTE: tests P and S,T? Or TASTE: T,A,S,T,E? Then T tested twice? Not ideal? Because we have a repeated T? Maybe avoid? Unless the first T is at position 1? And second at 4? 

But SAUTE has all unique letters: S, A, U, T, E -> good.

Therefore, I think SAUTE is a strong candidate.

So guess: SAUTE

But let me confirm spelling? SAUTE is a valid English word? Yes? As in cooking term? Saute.

So we'll go with that.

Think step by step: 

We have to include E at the end? Yes? Because we know E is at position 5? So SAUTE ends with E? Good.

Also avoids C, R, N? Good.

Tests S, A (at position 2?), U, T? Good.

So feedback from SAUTE will tell us:
- S at position 1: could be x, ✓ or -? 
- A at position 2: ✓ or -? Because we know A is in the word? So either ✓ or -? But if A is at position 1, then S might be something? Actually, we don't know? But the symbols will tell.

Hence, I choose SAUTE.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is in the correct position (5th letter).
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- C, R, and N are not in the word.

For the second guess:
- The word must end with E (position 5).
- Must include A, but not in position 3.
- Avoid C, R, and N.
- Test new common letters like S, T, U to gather more information.

I selected ""saute"" because:
- It ends with E (satisfying the known E position).
- Places A in position 2 (a new position to test after the 3rd position was ruled out).
- Uses new letters S, U, T (common vowels/consonants not tested).
- Avoids C, R, N.

This choice efficiently explores possible positions for A and tests multiple new letters.

Because in ""CRANE"", A was at position 3 and it was marked as \'-\' meaning present but wrong position. That means in the secret word, A is present but not at position 3. So in BLAME, we are putting A at position 3 again, which we know is incorrect? Actually, we are allowed to put A there again? But it might give us a minus again? That wouldn\'t tell us anything new? Except that if we put A at position 3 and get a minus again, we don\'t learn anything. We already know it\'s not position 3.\n\nTherefore, we should avoid putting A in position 3 because we know it\'s wrong. The feedback for A was a minus meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So we can try A at other positions.\n\nSo let\'s try A at position 1 (like in ""AGATE"") or position 2 (like in ""PLATE"" but position 2 would be for PLATE: P-L-A-T-E -> A is in position 3? That\'s the same as above.\n\nWait, PLATE: P-L-A-T-E -> A is at index 3 (if we start at 1: P=1, L=2, A=3, T=4, E=5). And we know position 3 is bad for A.\n\nSo what about words with A at position 4? For example, ""CAUSE""? But C is already known to be absent? So CAUSE has C -> not allowed.\n\nWhat about ""SAUCE""? Also has C -> bad.\n\nHow about ""PAUSE"": P-A-U-S-E -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:U, 4:S, 5:E -> so A is at position 2? That\'s acceptable.\n\nAlso, ""STARE""? But R is absent? STARE has R -> bad.\n\nSo ""PAUSE"" is a candidate: P, A at position 2, U, S, E at position 5.\n\nSimilarly, ""SLATE"": S-L-A-T-E -> A at position 3? Again, bad.\n\nWhat about ""HASTE"": H-A-S-T-E -> A at position 2? That works.\n\nBut we don\'t know if H is in the word? That\'s what we test.\n\nWait, we know E is at position 5, so words ending in E.\n\nList: \n- with A at position 1: AGATE, ABASE, AWAKE, ADAGE, etc. But avoid C,R,N.\n- with A at position 2: BASTE, TASTE, PASTE? Wait, PASTE: P,A,S,T,E -> A at position 2? Yes. Similarly, MAIZE, but might be less common? Also has Z which is less common.\n\nAnother: PLACE? No C? PLACE has C and E? But C is bad? PLACE ends with E? Place: P L A C E -> so C at position 4? And we know C is bad -> avoid.\n\nSo acceptable words: \nFor A at position 1: AGATE (A,G,A,T,E) -> possible? A repeated? Actually, double A? That\'s okay. But we are testing G and T. Also, if the secret word has only one A, then if we have A at position 1, if it\'s correct we get ✓ for that A. But since there is a double A in AGATE, the feedback might show both A\'s? However, we only have one A in the secret word presumably? We don\'t know. But the word AGATE has A at positions 1 and 3? Position 3 is bad? We know position 3 is bad for A? Actually, we have A at position 1 and 3? We avoid position 3? Because we know position 3 is not correct. So then AGATE might be bad because we are putting A at position 3 again? But the feedback for position 3 might not be helpful? It will tell us if A is there or not? But we already know there is an A, so putting it at position 3 will give minus? That doesn\'t tell us new positions.\n\nInstead, we should try to put A in a new position: position 1 or 4? Position 4? Words with A at position 4.\n\nFor example, ""CAUSE"" has C -> bad.\n\n""HOUSE"": H-O-U-S-E -> no A -> must exclude.\n\nWe must have A in the word. So for words ending in E and having A not in position 3? So position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nPosition 4? That is, letter in position 4 is A? Then words like ...A followed by E? For example, ...AE? But E is fixed at the end. So words ending in AE? But then position 4: A and 5: E. Words: BLARE? Has R -> bad. SHADE? H-A-D-E? But positions: S=? H=? A=? D=? E? Wait, SHADE: S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> A at position 3? Bad.\n\nGLADE: G(1), L(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> A at 3? Bad.\n\nFLAKE? F(1),L(2),A(3),K(4),E(5) -> A at 3? Bad.\n\nSo it\'s hard to find words with A at position 4 that are common? Because of the pattern? Words ending in AE? But in English, words with AE ending are rare? Except for proper nouns? Most common words are like CAFE? But CAFE has E at end? But A is at position 2? CAFE: C(1),A(2),F(3),E(4) -> wait 4 letters? Five letters: CAFÉ? But normally we consider CAFE as 5? No, CAFE is 4 letters? We need 5 letters. So not.\n\nOther word? PLACE? Has C and A at position 3? Bad.\n\nPerhaps we should focus on position 2 for A? \n\nSo words with A at position 2 and ending in E? These are common? Like PASTE? PASTE: P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5). But note: position 3 is S? We don\'t care? And we avoid C,R,N? PASTE has no C,R,N? So acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, TASTE: T(1),A(2),S(3),T(4),E(5) -> T repeated? Might be okay? But less ideal? Because we are testing fewer letters?\n\nSimilarly, BASTE: B(1),A(2),S(3),T(4),E(5).\n\nAnother: HASTE: H(1),A(2),S(3),T(4),E(5).\n\nOr WAIVE: W(1),A(2),I(3),V(4),E(5)? But W is less common? WAIVE is valid.\n\nOr GAUZE? G(1),A(2),U(3),Z(4),E(5) -> U? Z? But less common.\n\nSo PASTE, HASTE, BASTE, TASTE? All acceptable.\n\nNow among these, we can pick one. Also, want to test new letters? The new letters in PASTE: P, A, S, T, E -> but E we already know? So testing P, S, T, and also A at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, HASTE: H, S, T.\n\nSame for others.\n\nWhat about ""SAUTE""? That we thought earlier? SAUTE: S(1),A(2),U(3),T(4),E(5) -> A at position 2? Actually, SAUTE is S-A-U-T-E -> position 2 is A? No: position 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:T, 5:E? So A at position 2? And S,U,T.\n\nSAUTE has no C,R,N.\n\nI think SAUTE is a good choice because it tests S,A,U,T,E? But E is known? But we put it again? That\'s okay? Actually, it will confirm E at position 5? Although we know? But it can help? But we are forced to put E at the end? So we don\'t test E again? We are testing the other letters.\n\nTherefore, let\'s go with ""saute"".\n\nSo our next guess: SAUTE\n\nThis way:\n- If A is at position 2, then we get A(✓) and we\'re happy? But note: A might be elsewhere? Actually, no, we are testing position 2? So if A is at position 2 then ✓? If not, then minus? And we know it\'s present? So it tells us if position 2 is correct or not? If minus then A is in the word but not at position 2? Then it must be at position 1 or 4? But position 4 we have T? So we can see.\n\nAlso, we test S, U, T.\n\nWhich of these can reveal new letters? \n\nAlternatively, we could choose PASTE: tests P and S,T? Or TASTE: T,A,S,T,E? Then T tested twice? Not ideal? Because we have a repeated T? Maybe avoid? Unless the first T is at position 1? And second at 4? \n\nBut SAUTE has all unique letters: S, A, U, T, E -> good.\n\nTherefore, I think SAUTE is a strong candidate.\n\nSo guess: SAUTE\n\nBut let me confirm spelling? SAUTE is a valid English word? Yes? As in cooking term? Saute.\n\nSo we\'ll go with that.\n\nThink step by step: \n\nWe have to include E at the end? Yes? Because we know E is at position 5? So SAUTE ends with E? Good.\n\nAlso avoids C, R, N? Good.\n\nTests S, A (at position 2?), U, T? Good.\n\nSo feedback from SAUTE will tell us:\n- S at position 1: could be x, ✓ or -? \n- A at position 2: ✓ or -? Because we know A is in the word? So either ✓ or -? But if A is at position 1, then S might be something? Actually, we don\'t know? But the symbols will tell.\n\nHence, I choose SAUTE.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- E is in the correct position (5th letter).\n- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.\n- C, R, and N are not in the word.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must end with E (position 5).\n- Must include A, but not in position 3.\n- Avoid C, R, and N.\n- Test new common letters like S, T, U to gather more information.\n\nI selected ""saute"" because:\n- It ends with E (satisfying the known E position).\n- Places A in position 2 (a new position to test after the 3rd position was ruled out).\n- Uses new letters S, U, T (common vowels/consonants not tested).\n- Avoids C, R, N.\n\nThis choice efficiently explores possible positions for A and tests multiple new letters.\n\n<guess>saute</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: saute -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
After the first guess ""crane"", we knew:
-[ - ] C is not in the word (x)
-[ - ] R is not in the word (x)
-[ - ] A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3)
-[ - ] N is not in the word (x)
-[ ✓ ] E is in the word and correct position (position 5)

So the secret word has A and E, with E at the end. A is not at position 3, so it must be at 1, 2, or 4. And we avoid C, R, N.

Now for the second guess ""saute"":
-[ x ] S is not in the word
-[ - ] A is in the word but wrong position (so not at position 2)
-[ x ] U is not in the word
-[ x ] T is not in the word
-[ ✓ ] E is correct (position 5, as before)

So combining both feedbacks:
- The word has E at position 5.
- The word has A, but A is not at position 3 (from first guess) and not at position 2 (from second guess). So A must be at position 1 or 4.
- Also, the word does not contain: C, R, N, S, U, T. 

New list of absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T.

Now, since A must be at position 1 or 4, and E is fixed at position 5.

We need to guess a word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Contains A at either position 1 or position 4 (to test)
- Avoids C, R, N, S, U, T.
- Tests other new common letters, like L, I, O, D, G, B, P, M, etc.

Possibilities for A:

If A at position 1: Words of form A _ _ E? But position 5 is E? So A word at position 1 and E at 5? Like A _ _ _ E? For example, AWAKE? But W and K? We are not avoiding them? But let's see available letters.

First, what words are possible?

We know the word must include A at position 1 or 4? But also other letters? 

But we have limited letters? We must avoid: C, R, N, S, U, T. So that leaves vowels: A, E already (A confirmed, E fixed), and other vowels? O, I? Or consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

Since we have few constraints? Especially because we don't know other letters? Except that there must be two more letters? Actually, between or around A and E? 

Perhaps we should guess a word that places A at position 1 to test? For example, guess a word starting with A and ending with E? With three letters in between? Avoid C,R,N,S,U,T? 

Common words: ABASE? A B A S E? But S is not allowed? Because we learned from ""saute"" that S is absent? So ABASE has S → bad.

ADAGE? A D A G E → D, G? But A repeated? And second A at position 3? But we know position 3 should not have A? Since we ruled out position 3? Actually, the rule says A is present but not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3, it would be redundant? But ADAGE has A at 1 and 3? Position 1? Position 3? We know position 3 cannot be correct for A? So if we guess ADAGE, position 3 A would give a minus? Which doesn't help? Because we know A is not at position 3 anyway? But position 1 might be correct? 

But ADAGE has D and G? New letters? And avoids C,R,N,S,U,T? So D and G are untested? Possible.

But two A's might confuse? Also, G? 

Another word? AGAPE? A G A P E? Also has G,P? And A at 3? Similarly, position? But has S? No: AGAPE: A G A P E? No S? So possible? But G and P? Position 3 A.

But let's avoid putting A at position 3? Since we know it's wrong? So in ADAGE, we have A at position 1 and 3? We hope that A at 1 gets ✓? Or minus? While A at 3 will definitely get minus? Which is expected.

Similarly, AGAPE? Same thing.

But we might be able to use a word with A only once? At position 1? Without repeating A? 

For example, ""ABATE""? A B A T E? But has T? Which we learned is absent? From ""saute"". T is absent? Yes from saute T(x) → so T is absent? Therefore, ABATE has T → bad.

""ALIKE""? A L I K E? But A at position 1? L,I,K? Avoids? Yes: C,R,N,S,U,T are absent? So ALIKE: A L I K E? Positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:I, 4:K, 5:E? This places A at position 1? Which is a possibility? And tests L, I, K? Also E confirmed.

Similarly, ""AMIZE""? Not common? ""AMPLE""? But P,L? But ample ends with E? A M P L E? Positions: 1:A, 2:M, 3:P, 4:L, 5:E? Yes. 

But we need to confirm? Ample is a valid word? Yes.

Other words: ""AGILE""? A G I L E? Ends with E? Positions: 1:A, 2:G, 3:I, 4:L, 5:E? A at position 1? 

Similarly, ""ALIVE""? A L I V E? Ends with E? Position 1:A? Then L,I,V? 

But V? Less common? But valid? 

Now, what about A at position 4? Words where the fourth letter is A and fifth is E? Pattern: _ _ _ A E? 

But such words? For example, ""OPAQUE""? Too long? 6 letters? Not. 

""FUGAE""? Not common? English words with AE ending? Like ""PLACE""? But has C? And we avoid C? Also less common? 

""BRAAE""? No? 

""ABASE""? But again S? Not allowed? 

Perhaps uncommon? So likely that A is at position 1? 

Since E is fixed? We can test position 1 for A? 

But we must also consider that A might be at position 4? So we need to test? 

Either choose a word with A at position 1 to see? 

If we choose ALIKE? Then:
- If A at position 1 is correct, we get ✓? Otherwise minus? Which tells us if A is at 1 or 4? 

Similarly, if minus, then A not at 1 and must be at position 4? Then we know? 

So ALIVE? I will choose ALIVE? Because more common letters? L,I,V,E? 

But V? Or ALIKE? With K? Prefer more common? 

Common letters left: L, I, O, D, G, M, etc? 

Word ""ALIKE"": letters A,L,I,K,E? Avoids bad letters? Yes C,R,N,S,U,T? And K and L? 

""ALIVE"": A,L,I,V,E? V is less common? 

Or ""AGILE""? A,G,I,L,E? 

Since we have few constraints? But must include A? 

Also, the word might have more revealed? 

But from feedback, only A and E are known? Plus C,R,N,S,U,T absent? 

So secret word: _ _ _ _ E, with A in position 1 or 4? And letters avoiding C,R,N,S,U,T? 

Possible letters: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,W,X,Y,Z? But E already? 

Now, we guess ALIKE? Or ABIDE? But ABIDE: A B I D E? D? Avoids? Yes? 

But let's look? 

I think good? 

To maximize letter testing? 

Perhaps choose a word with common vowels? Like I? 

And consonants? 

For example, ""ABIDE"": A B I D E? Positions: A at 1? B and I and D? All new? 

But avoid repeated letters? 

Similarly, ""ALIKE"" : A L I K E? 

Or ""AMIDE""? A M I D E? 

All possible? 

I'll go with ""alike""? But ALIKE? 

But K is less common? 

""AMPLY""? No E? Not ending E? 

""APPLE""? A P P L E? But ends E? Positions: A at 1? Then P,P,L? Double P? Avoid? Because repeated? Might be inefficient? 

So ""ALIKE"" seems fine? 

Or ""AGILE""? 

Choose ""agile"". 

AGILE: A G I L E? New letters G,I,L? 

If G at position 2?, I at 3?, L at 4? 

Then feedback will tell? 

Also for A: if A is at position 1? If we get ✓ then we know A position? If minus then we know A is at position 4? 

So I choose ""agile"". 

AGILE? A-G-I-L-E? 

Avoids C,R,N,S,U,T? Yes. 

Available letters? Yes? 

So guess: AGILE

But wait? AGILE has letter L! I'm testing L? Good? 

So step-by-step? 

We need to confirm? 

Also, E at 5? Yes? 

So <guess>agile</guess> 

But? Better? 

Another word? Such as ""ABODE""? A B O D E? Avoids? Yes? And tests O? 

But also B,O,D? 

But O? 

We have fewer vowels tested? So testing I? And G? In AGILE? 

I think AGILE is fine. 

Therefore:
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: ""C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)"" 
- **Guess 2: saute** → Feedback: ""S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)""

We can deduce:
1. **E is confirmed at position 5** (from both guesses).
2. **A is in the word** but not in position 3 (from crane) or position 2 (from saute). Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 4.
3. **Absent letters:** C, R, N, S, U, T (marked as ""x"" in feedback). These cannot be in the word.
4. **Other constraints:** The word must have exactly one A (since repeated A would not be consistent with feedback), and E is fixed at the end.

For the next guess:
- Focus on placing **A in position 1 or 4** to resolve its location.
- Use **new, common letters** not yet tested (e.g., G, I, L, D, O, M, P) to maximize information gain.
- Avoid known absent letters (C, R, N, S, U, T).

After considering possible words:
- **Selected guess: AGILE** 
  - Why?  
    - Positions: A at position 1 (tests A placement), G at 2, I at 3, L at 4, E at 5 (fixed).
    - Tests A in position 1 explicitly. If A is here, it will show ""✓""; if not, it confirms A must be at position 4.
    - Introduces three new common letters (G, I, L) for additional clues.
    - Avoids all absent letters and has no conflicts.
    - Example alternatives like ALIKE or ABIDE were less ideal (K is less common; D and B are good but provide similar coverage).

This guess efficiently balances resolving the A position while covering new letters.

<guess>agile</guess>",agile,"After the first guess ""crane"", we knew:
-[ - ] C is not in the word (x)
-[ - ] R is not in the word (x)
-[ - ] A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3)
-[ - ] N is not in the word (x)
-[ ✓ ] E is in the word and correct position (position 5)

So the secret word has A and E, with E at the end. A is not at position 3, so it must be at 1, 2, or 4. And we avoid C, R, N.

Now for the second guess ""saute"":
-[ x ] S is not in the word
-[ - ] A is in the word but wrong position (so not at position 2)
-[ x ] U is not in the word
-[ x ] T is not in the word
-[ ✓ ] E is correct (position 5, as before)

So combining both feedbacks:
- The word has E at position 5.
- The word has A, but A is not at position 3 (from first guess) and not at position 2 (from second guess). So A must be at position 1 or 4.
- Also, the word does not contain: C, R, N, S, U, T. 

New list of absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T.

Now, since A must be at position 1 or 4, and E is fixed at position 5.

We need to guess a word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Contains A at either position 1 or position 4 (to test)
- Avoids C, R, N, S, U, T.
- Tests other new common letters, like L, I, O, D, G, B, P, M, etc.

Possibilities for A:

If A at position 1: Words of form A _ _ E? But position 5 is E? So A word at position 1 and E at 5? Like A _ _ _ E? For example, AWAKE? But W and K? We are not avoiding them? But let's see available letters.

Common words: ABASE? A B A S E? But S is not allowed? Because we learned from ""saute"" that S is absent? So ABASE has S → bad.

ADAGE? A D A G E → D, G? But A repeated? And second A at position 3? But we know position 3 should not have A? Since we ruled out position 3? Actually, the rule says A is present but not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3, it would be redundant? But ADAGE has A at 1 and 3? Position 1? Position 3? We know position 3 cannot be correct for A? So if we guess ADAGE, position 3 A would give a minus? Which doesn't help? Because we know A is not at position 3 anyway? But position 1 might be correct? 

But ADAGE has D and G? New letters? And avoids C,R,N,S,U,T? So D and G are untested? Possible.

But two A's might confuse? Also, G? 

Another word? AGAPE? A G A P E? Also has G,P? And A at 3? Similarly, position? But has S? No: AGAPE: A G A P E? No S? So possible? But G and P? Position 3 A.

But let's avoid putting A at position 3? Since we know it's wrong? So in ADAGE, we have A at position 1 and 3? We hope that A at 1 gets ✓? Or minus? While A at 3 will definitely get minus? Which is expected.

Similarly, AGAPE? Same thing.

But we might be able to use a word with A only once? At position 1? Without repeating A? 

For example, ""ABATE""? A B A T E? But has T? Which we learned is absent? From ""saute"". T is absent? Yes from saute T(x) → so T is absent? Therefore, ABATE has T → bad.

""ALIKE""? A L I K E? But A at position 1? L,I,K? Avoids? Yes: C,R,N,S,U,T are absent? So ALIKE: A L I K E? Positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:I, 4:K, 5:E? This places A at position 1? Which is a possibility? And tests L, I, K? Also E confirmed.

Similarly, ""AMIZE""? Not common? ""AMPLE""? But P,L? But ample ends with E? A M P L E? Positions: 1:A, 2:M, 3:P, 4:L, 5:E? Yes. 

But we need to confirm? Ample is a valid word? Yes.

Other words: ""AGILE""? A G I L E? Ends with E? Positions: 1:A, 2:G, 3:I, 4:L, 5:E? A at position 1? 

Similarly, ""ALIVE""? A L I V E? Ends with E? Position 1:A? Then L,I,V? 

But V? Less common? But valid? 

Now, what about A at position 4? Words where the fourth letter is A and fifth is E? Pattern: _ _ _ A E? 

But such words? For example, ""OPAQUE""? Too long? 6 letters? Not. 

""FUGAE""? Not common? English words with AE ending? Like ""PLACE""? But has C? And we avoid C? Also less common? 

""BRAAE""? No? 

""ABASE""? But again S? Not allowed? 

Perhaps uncommon? So likely that A is at position 1? 

Since E is fixed? We can test position 1 for A? 

But we must also consider that A might be at position 4? So we need to test? 

Either choose a word with A at position 1 to see? 

If we choose ALIKE? Then:
- If A at position 1 is correct, we get ✓? Otherwise minus? Which tells us if A is at 1 or 4? 

Similarly, if minus, then A not at 1 and must be at position 4? Then we know? 

So ALIVE? I will choose ALIVE? Because more common letters? L,I,V,E? 

But V? Or ALIKE? With K? Prefer more common? 

Common letters left: L, I, O, D, G, M, etc?

Since we have few constraints? But must include A? 

Also, the word might have more revealed? 

But from feedback, only A and E are known? Plus C,R,N,S,U,T absent? 

So secret word: _ _ _ _ E, with A in position 1 or 4? And letters avoiding C,R,N,S,U,T? 

Possible letters: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,W,X,Y,Z? But E already? 

Now, we guess ALIKE? Or ABIDE? But ABIDE: A B I D E? D? Avoids? Yes? 

But let's look? 

I think good? 

To maximize letter testing? 

Perhaps choose a word with common vowels? Like I? 

And consonants? 

For example, ""ABIDE"": A B I D E? Positions: A at 1? B and I and D? All new? 

But avoid repeated letters? 

Similarly, ""ALIKE"" : A L I K E? 

Or ""AMIDE""? A M I D E? 

All possible? 

I'll go with ""alike""? But ALIKE? 

But K is less common? 

""AMPLY""? No E? Not ending E? 

""APPLE""? A P P L E? But ends E? Positions: A at 1? Then P,P,L? Double P? Avoid? Because repeated? Might be inefficient? 

So ""ALIKE"" seems fine? 

Or ""AGILE""? 

Choose ""agile"". 

AGILE: A G I L E? New letters G,I,L? 

If G at position 2?, I at 3?, L at 4? 

Then feedback will tell? 

Also for A: if A is at position 1? If we get ✓ then we know A position? If minus then we know A is at position 4? 

So I choose ""agile"". 

AGILE? A-G-I-L-E? 

Avoids C,R,N,S,U,T? Yes. 

Available letters? Yes? 

So guess: AGILE

But wait? AGILE has letter L! I'm testing L? Good? 

So step-by-step? 

We need to confirm? 

Also, E at 5? Yes? 

So <guess>agile</guess> 

But? Better? 

Another word? Such as ""ABODE""? A B O D E? Avoids? Yes? And tests O? 

But also B,O,D? 

But O? 

We have fewer vowels tested? So testing I? And G? In AGILE? 

I think AGILE is fine. 

Therefore:After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: ""C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)"" 
- **Guess 2: saute** → Feedback: ""S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)""

We can deduce:
1. **E is confirmed at position 5** (from both guesses).
2. **A is in the word** but not in position 3 (from crane) or position 2 (from saute). Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 4.
3. **Absent letters:** C, R, N, S, U, T (marked as ""x"" in feedback). These cannot be in the word.
4. **Other constraints:** The word must have exactly one A (since repeated A would not be consistent with feedback), and E is fixed at the end.

For the next guess:
- Focus on placing **A in position 1 or 4** to resolve its location.
- Use **new, common letters** not yet tested (e.g., G, I, L, D, O, M, P) to maximize information gain.
- Avoid known absent letters (C, R, N, S, U, T).

After considering possible words:
- **Selected guess: AGILE** 
  - Why?  
    - Positions: A at position 1 (tests A placement), G at 2, I at 3, L at 4, E at 5 (fixed).
    - Tests A in position 1 explicitly. If A is here, it will show ""✓""; if not, it confirms A must be at position 4.
    - Introduces three new common letters (G, I, L) for additional clues.
    - Avoids all absent letters and has no conflicts.
    - Example alternatives like ALIKE or ABIDE were less ideal (K is less common; D and B are good but provide similar coverage).

This guess efficiently balances resolving the A position while covering new letters.",Guess 3: agile -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) G(x) I(x) L(x) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,above,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word that includes common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

This tells us:
- The letter E is in the word and is in the 5th position (since it's the last letter of ""crane"" and got a check).
- The letter A is in the word, but not in the 3rd position (because ""crane"" has A at position 3 and it got a minus).
- The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- E at the 5th position.
- A somewhere, but not in the 3rd position. It could be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Since A is present and not in position 3, and E is fixed at position 5, we can think of words that have A and E (with E at the end).

We must avoid using C, R, and N because they are not in the word.

Now, for the next guess, we want to test other common letters and also try to find the position for A.

We could try a word that:
- Ends with E (since E is fixed at position 5).
- Contains A in a different position (not position 3 and not in the same position as the previous A to test a new spot).
- Avoids C, R, N.

Also, we should include other common letters that we haven't tested yet to gather more information.

Common letters not yet tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, etc.

Since A is in the word, but we don't know where, we can try placing A in position 1 or 2 or 4.

Let's try to put A in position 1 for this guess, while keeping E at the end.

One common word is ""SAUTE"". This word has:
- S: untested
- A at position 1
- U: untested
- T: untested
- E at position 5 (fixed)

But note: we are also avoiding C, R, N, so S, U, T are okay.

However, we must consider the possibility that A might not be at position 1, but this guess will help us rule that in or out.

Another idea: we could try placing A in position 4, with words like ""PLATE"" but P and L are untested. Also note we have to avoid R, so plate has no R? Actually we know R is absent so that's okay? Wait, feedback for R was x, so R is not in the word? So indeed, avoid R.

But let me double-check: In the first guess, R was at position 2 and got an x, meaning R is not anywhere in the word. So we must avoid R.

So, word ""saute"" does not contain R, and avoids C, R, N. It also has E at the end.

If we guess ""saute"":
- If A gets a ✓ then we know A is at position 1. If A gets a - then we know A is not at position 1 but still in the word (so must be at position 2 or 4). It can't be at position 3 because from the first guess we know at position 3 it wasn't present (but actually the first guess had A at position 3 and got a minus meaning A is present but not there, so positions 1,2,4 are possible).

Alternatively, we could try a word with A in position 2? Like ""PASTE""? But that has P, A at 2, S, T, E.

But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another common word might be ""LEAST"", but it has L, E (at position 5 is fixed but we are putting E at 5? Actually LEAST has E at the end? Wait, LEAST is L,E,A,S,T -> positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T -> no E at the end? So we cannot use that because we know E is fixed at position 5. So the word must end with E.

Therefore, we need a word that ends with E.

So options: 5-letter words ending in E and containing A (in positions 1,2, or 4).

Examples:
- A in position 1: AGATE, ABASE, etc. But let's avoid using letters we know are bad? We know C,R,N are bad. So AGATE? A, G, A, T, E -> but A repeated? We don't mind repetition if valid. But we can try.

But we also want to test new letters.

Similarly, A in position 4: words like BLARE, but we know R is bad so BLARE has R -> must avoid.

So BLAME? B-L-A-M-E -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:M, 5:E -> but A is at position 3? But remember our first guess had A at position 3 and got a minus meaning that A is not at position 3? Exactly! Because in ""CRANE"", A was at position 3 and it was marked as '-' meaning present but wrong position. That means in the secret word, A is present but not at position 3. So in BLAME, we are putting A at position 3 again, which we know is incorrect? Actually, we are allowed to put A there again? But it might give us a minus again? That wouldn't tell us anything new? Except that if we put A at position 3 and get a minus again, we don't learn anything. We already know it's not position 3.

Therefore, we should avoid putting A in position 3 because we know it's wrong. The feedback for A was a minus meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So we can try A at other positions.

So let's try A at position 1 (like in ""AGATE"") or position 2 (like in ""PLATE"" but position 2 would be for PLATE: P-L-A-T-E -> A is in position 3? That's the same as above.

Wait, PLATE: P-L-A-T-E -> A is at index 3 (if we start at 1: P=1, L=2, A=3, T=4, E=5). And we know position 3 is bad for A.

So what about words with A at position 4? For example, ""CAUSE""? But C is already known to be absent? So CAUSE has C -> not allowed.

What about ""SAUCE""? Also has C -> bad.

How about ""PAUSE"": P-A-U-S-E -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:U, 4:S, 5:E -> so A is at position 2? That's acceptable.

Also, ""STARE""? But R is absent? STARE has R -> bad.

So ""PAUSE"" is a candidate: P, A at position 2, U, S, E at position 5.

Similarly, ""SLATE"": S-L-A-T-E -> A at position 3? Again, bad.

What about ""HASTE"": H-A-S-T-E -> A at position 2? That works.

But we don't know if H is in the word? That's what we test.

Wait, we know E is at position 5, so words ending in E.

List: 
- with A at position 1: AGATE, ABASE, AWAKE, ADAGE, etc. But avoid C,R,N.
- with A at position 2: BASTE, TASTE, PASTE? Wait, PASTE: P,A,S,T,E -> A at position 2? Yes. Similarly, MAIZE, but might be less common? Also has Z which is less common.

Another: PLACE? No C? PLACE has C and E? But C is bad? PLACE ends with E? Place: P L A C E -> so C at position 4? And we know C is bad -> avoid.

So acceptable words: 
For A at position 1: AGATE (A,G,A,T,E) -> possible? A repeated? Actually, double A? That's okay. But we are testing G and T. Also, if the secret word has only one A, then if we have A at position 1, if it's correct we get ✓ for that A. But since there is a double A in AGATE, the feedback might show both A's? However, we only have one A in the secret word presumably? We don't know. But the word AGATE has A at positions 1 and 3? Position 3 is bad? We know position 3 is bad for A? Actually, we have A at position 1 and 3? We avoid position 3? Because we know position 3 is not correct. So then AGATE might be bad because we are putting A at position 3 again? But the feedback for position 3 might not be helpful? It will tell us if A is there or not? But we already know there is an A, so putting it at position 3 will give minus? That doesn't tell us new positions.

Instead, we should try to put A in a new position: position 1 or 4? Position 4? Words with A at position 4.

For example, ""CAUSE"" has C -> bad.

""HOUSE"": H-O-U-S-E -> no A -> must exclude.

We must have A in the word. So for words ending in E and having A not in position 3? So position 1, 2, or 4.

Position 4? That is, letter in position 4 is A? Then words like ...A followed by E? For example, ...AE? But E is fixed at the end. So words ending in AE? But then position 4: A and 5: E. Words: BLARE? Has R -> bad. SHADE? H-A-D-E? But positions: S=? H=? A=? D=? E? Wait, SHADE: S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> A at position 3? Bad.

GLADE: G(1), L(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> A at 3? Bad.

FLAKE? F(1),L(2),A(3),K(4),E(5) -> A at 3? Bad.

So it's hard to find words with A at position 4 that are common? Because of the pattern? Words ending in AE? But in English, words with AE ending are rare? Except for proper nouns? Most common words are like CAFE? But CAFE has E at end? But A is at position 2? CAFE: C(1),A(2),F(3),E(4) -> wait 4 letters? Five letters: CAFÉ? But normally we consider CAFE as 5? No, CAFE is 4 letters? We need 5 letters. So not.

Other word? PLACE? Has C and A at position 3? Bad.

Perhaps we should focus on position 2 for A? 

So words with A at position 2 and ending in E? These are common? Like PASTE? PASTE: P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5). But note: position 3 is S? We don't care? And we avoid C,R,N? PASTE has no C,R,N? So acceptable.

Similarly, TASTE: T(1),A(2),S(3),T(4),E(5) -> T repeated? Might be okay? But less ideal? Because we are testing fewer letters?

Similarly, BASTE: B(1),A(2),S(3),T(4),E(5).

Another: HASTE: H(1),A(2),S(3),T(4),E(5).

Or WAIVE: W(1),A(2),I(3),V(4),E(5)? But W is less common? WAIVE is valid.

Or GAUZE? G(1),A(2),U(3),Z(4),E(5) -> U? Z? But less common.

So PASTE, HASTE, BASTE, TASTE? All acceptable.

Now among these, we can pick one. Also, want to test new letters? The new letters in PASTE: P, A, S, T, E -> but E we already know? So testing P, S, T, and also A at position 2.

Similarly, HASTE: H, S, T.

Same for others.

What about ""SAUTE""? That we thought earlier? SAUTE: S(1),A(2),U(3),T(4),E(5) -> A at position 2? Actually, SAUTE is S-A-U-T-E -> position 2 is A? No: position 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:T, 5:E? So A at position 2? And S,U,T.

SAUTE has no C,R,N.

I think SAUTE is a good choice because it tests S,A,U,T,E? But E is known? But we put it again? That's okay? Actually, it will confirm E at position 5? Although we know? But it can help? But we are forced to put E at the end? So we don't test E again? We are testing the other letters.

Therefore, let's go with ""saute"".

So our next guess: SAUTE

This way:
- If A is at position 2, then we get A(✓) and we're happy? But note: A might be elsewhere? Actually, no, we are testing position 2? So if A is at position 2 then ✓? If not, then minus? And we know it's present? So it tells us if position 2 is correct or not? If minus then A is in the word but not at position 2? Then it must be at position 1 or 4? But position 4 we have T? So we can see.

Also, we test S, U, T.

Which of these can reveal new letters? 

Alternatively, we could choose PASTE: tests P and S,T? Or TASTE: T,A,S,T,E? Then T tested twice? Not ideal? Because we have a repeated T? Maybe avoid? Unless the first T is at position 1? And second at 4? 

But SAUTE has all unique letters: S, A, U, T, E -> good.

Therefore, I think SAUTE is a strong candidate.

So guess: SAUTE

But let me confirm spelling? SAUTE is a valid English word? Yes? As in cooking term? Saute.

So we'll go with that.

Think step by step: 

We have to include E at the end? Yes? Because we know E is at position 5? So SAUTE ends with E? Good.

Also avoids C, R, N? Good.

Tests S, A (at position 2?), U, T? Good.

So feedback from SAUTE will tell us:
- S at position 1: could be x, ✓ or -? 
- A at position 2: ✓ or -? Because we know A is in the word? So either ✓ or -? But if A is at position 1, then S might be something? Actually, we don't know? But the symbols will tell.

Hence, I choose SAUTE.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is in the correct position (5th letter).
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- C, R, and N are not in the word.

For the second guess:
- The word must end with E (position 5).
- Must include A, but not in position 3.
- Avoid C, R, and N.
- Test new common letters like S, T, U to gather more information.

I selected ""saute"" because:
- It ends with E (satisfying the known E position).
- Places A in position 2 (a new position to test after the 3rd position was ruled out).
- Uses new letters S, U, T (common vowels/consonants not tested).
- Avoids C, R, N.

This choice efficiently explores possible positions for A and tests multiple new letters.

<guess>saute</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: saute -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>After the first guess ""crane"", we knew:
-[ - ] C is not in the word (x)
-[ - ] R is not in the word (x)
-[ - ] A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3)
-[ - ] N is not in the word (x)
-[ ✓ ] E is in the word and correct position (position 5)

So the secret word has A and E, with E at the end. A is not at position 3, so it must be at 1, 2, or 4. And we avoid C, R, N.

Now for the second guess ""saute"":
-[ x ] S is not in the word
-[ - ] A is in the word but wrong position (so not at position 2)
-[ x ] U is not in the word
-[ x ] T is not in the word
-[ ✓ ] E is correct (position 5, as before)

So combining both feedbacks:
- The word has E at position 5.
- The word has A, but A is not at position 3 (from first guess) and not at position 2 (from second guess). So A must be at position 1 or 4.
- Also, the word does not contain: C, R, N, S, U, T. 

New list of absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T.

Now, since A must be at position 1 or 4, and E is fixed at position 5.

We need to guess a word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Contains A at either position 1 or position 4 (to test)
- Avoids C, R, N, S, U, T.
- Tests other new common letters, like L, I, O, D, G, B, P, M, etc.

Possibilities for A:

If A at position 1: Words of form A _ _ E? But position 5 is E? So A word at position 1 and E at 5? Like A _ _ _ E? For example, AWAKE? But W and K? We are not avoiding them? But let's see available letters.

First, what words are possible?

We know the word must include A at position 1 or 4? But also other letters? 

But we have limited letters? We must avoid: C, R, N, S, U, T. So that leaves vowels: A, E already (A confirmed, E fixed), and other vowels? O, I? Or consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

Since we have few constraints? Especially because we don't know other letters? Except that there must be two more letters? Actually, between or around A and E? 

Perhaps we should guess a word that places A at position 1 to test? For example, guess a word starting with A and ending with E? With three letters in between? Avoid C,R,N,S,U,T? 

Common words: ABASE? A B A S E? But S is not allowed? Because we learned from ""saute"" that S is absent? So ABASE has S → bad.

ADAGE? A D A G E → D, G? But A repeated? And second A at position 3? But we know position 3 should not have A? Since we ruled out position 3? Actually, the rule says A is present but not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3, it would be redundant? But ADAGE has A at 1 and 3? Position 1? Position 3? We know position 3 cannot be correct for A? So if we guess ADAGE, position 3 A would give a minus? Which doesn't help? Because we know A is not at position 3 anyway? But position 1 might be correct? 

But ADAGE has D and G? New letters? And avoids C,R,N,S,U,T? So D and G are untested? Possible.

But two A's might confuse? Also, G? 

Another word? AGAPE? A G A P E? Also has G,P? And A at 3? Similarly, position? But has S? No: AGAPE: A G A P E? No S? So possible? But G and P? Position 3 A.

But let's avoid putting A at position 3? Since we know it's wrong? So in ADAGE, we have A at position 1 and 3? We hope that A at 1 gets ✓? Or minus? While A at 3 will definitely get minus? Which is expected.

Similarly, AGAPE? Same thing.

But we might be able to use a word with A only once? At position 1? Without repeating A? 

For example, ""ABATE""? A B A T E? But has T? Which we learned is absent? From ""saute"". T is absent? Yes from saute T(x) → so T is absent? Therefore, ABATE has T → bad.

""ALIKE""? A L I K E? But A at position 1? L,I,K? Avoids? Yes: C,R,N,S,U,T are absent? So ALIKE: A L I K E? Positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:I, 4:K, 5:E? This places A at position 1? Which is a possibility? And tests L, I, K? Also E confirmed.

Similarly, ""AMIZE""? Not common? ""AMPLE""? But P,L? But ample ends with E? A M P L E? Positions: 1:A, 2:M, 3:P, 4:L, 5:E? Yes. 

But we need to confirm? Ample is a valid word? Yes.

Other words: ""AGILE""? A G I L E? Ends with E? Positions: 1:A, 2:G, 3:I, 4:L, 5:E? A at position 1? 

Similarly, ""ALIVE""? A L I V E? Ends with E? Position 1:A? Then L,I,V? 

But V? Less common? But valid? 

Now, what about A at position 4? Words where the fourth letter is A and fifth is E? Pattern: _ _ _ A E? 

But such words? For example, ""OPAQUE""? Too long? 6 letters? Not. 

""FUGAE""? Not common? English words with AE ending? Like ""PLACE""? But has C? And we avoid C? Also less common? 

""BRAAE""? No? 

""ABASE""? But again S? Not allowed? 

Perhaps uncommon? So likely that A is at position 1? 

Since E is fixed? We can test position 1 for A? 

But we must also consider that A might be at position 4? So we need to test? 

Either choose a word with A at position 1 to see? 

If we choose ALIKE? Then:
- If A at position 1 is correct, we get ✓? Otherwise minus? Which tells us if A is at 1 or 4? 

Similarly, if minus, then A not at 1 and must be at position 4? Then we know? 

So ALIVE? I will choose ALIVE? Because more common letters? L,I,V,E? 

But V? Or ALIKE? With K? Prefer more common? 

Common letters left: L, I, O, D, G, M, etc? 

Word ""ALIKE"": letters A,L,I,K,E? Avoids bad letters? Yes C,R,N,S,U,T? And K and L? 

""ALIVE"": A,L,I,V,E? V is less common? 

Or ""AGILE""? A,G,I,L,E? 

Since we have few constraints? But must include A? 

Also, the word might have more revealed? 

But from feedback, only A and E are known? Plus C,R,N,S,U,T absent? 

So secret word: _ _ _ _ E, with A in position 1 or 4? And letters avoiding C,R,N,S,U,T? 

Possible letters: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,W,X,Y,Z? But E already? 

Now, we guess ALIKE? Or ABIDE? But ABIDE: A B I D E? D? Avoids? Yes? 

But let's look? 

I think good? 

To maximize letter testing? 

Perhaps choose a word with common vowels? Like I? 

And consonants? 

For example, ""ABIDE"": A B I D E? Positions: A at 1? B and I and D? All new? 

But avoid repeated letters? 

Similarly, ""ALIKE"" : A L I K E? 

Or ""AMIDE""? A M I D E? 

All possible? 

I'll go with ""alike""? But ALIKE? 

But K is less common? 

""AMPLY""? No E? Not ending E? 

""APPLE""? A P P L E? But ends E? Positions: A at 1? Then P,P,L? Double P? Avoid? Because repeated? Might be inefficient? 

So ""ALIKE"" seems fine? 

Or ""AGILE""? 

Choose ""agile"". 

AGILE: A G I L E? New letters G,I,L? 

If G at position 2?, I at 3?, L at 4? 

Then feedback will tell? 

Also for A: if A is at position 1? If we get ✓ then we know A position? If minus then we know A is at position 4? 

So I choose ""agile"". 

AGILE? A-G-I-L-E? 

Avoids C,R,N,S,U,T? Yes. 

Available letters? Yes? 

So guess: AGILE

But wait? AGILE has letter L! I'm testing L? Good? 

So step-by-step? 

We need to confirm? 

Also, E at 5? Yes? 

So <guess>agile</guess> 

But? Better? 

Another word? Such as ""ABODE""? A B O D E? Avoids? Yes? And tests O? 

But also B,O,D? 

But O? 

We have fewer vowels tested? So testing I? And G? In AGILE? 

I think AGILE is fine. 

Therefore:After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: ""C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)"" 
- **Guess 2: saute** → Feedback: ""S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)""

We can deduce:
1. **E is confirmed at position 5** (from both guesses).
2. **A is in the word** but not in position 3 (from crane) or position 2 (from saute). Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 4.
3. **Absent letters:** C, R, N, S, U, T (marked as ""x"" in feedback). These cannot be in the word.
4. **Other constraints:** The word must have exactly one A (since repeated A would not be consistent with feedback), and E is fixed at the end.

For the next guess:
- Focus on placing **A in position 1 or 4** to resolve its location.
- Use **new, common letters** not yet tested (e.g., G, I, L, D, O, M, P) to maximize information gain.
- Avoid known absent letters (C, R, N, S, U, T).

After considering possible words:
- **Selected guess: AGILE** 
  - Why?  
    - Positions: A at position 1 (tests A placement), G at 2, I at 3, L at 4, E at 5 (fixed).
    - Tests A in position 1 explicitly. If A is here, it will show ""✓""; if not, it confirms A must be at position 4.
    - Introduces three new common letters (G, I, L) for additional clues.
    - Avoids all absent letters and has no conflicts.
    - Example alternatives like ALIKE or ABIDE were less ideal (K is less common; D and B are good but provide similar coverage).

This guess efficiently balances resolving the A position while covering new letters.

It could be in position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nSince A is present and not in position 3, and E is fixed at position 5, we can think of words that have A and E (with E at the end).\n\nWe must avoid using C, R, and N because they are not in the word.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we want to test other common letters and also try to find the position for A.\n\nWe could try a word that:\n- Ends with E (since E is fixed at position 5).\n- Contains A in a different position (not position 3 and not in the same position as the previous A to test a new spot).\n- Avoids C, R, N.\n\nAlso, we should include other common letters that we haven\'t tested yet to gather more information.\n\nCommon letters not yet tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, etc.\n\nSince A is in the word, but we don\'t know where, we can try placing A in position 1 or 2 or 4.\n\nLet\'s try to put A in position 1 for this guess, while keeping E at the end.\n\nOne common word is ""SAUTE"". This word has:\n- S: untested\n- A at position 1\n- U: untested\n- T: untested\n- E at position 5 (fixed)\n\nBut note: we are also avoiding C, R, N, so S, U, T are okay.\n\nHowever, we must consider the possibility that A might not be at position 1, but this guess will help us rule that in or out.\n\nAnother idea: we could try placing A in position 4, with words like ""PLATE"" but P and L are untested. Also note we have to avoid R, so plate has no R? Actually we know R is absent so that\'s okay? Wait, feedback for R was x, so R is not in the word? So indeed, avoid R.\n\nBut let me double-check: In the first guess, R was at position 2 and got an x, meaning R is not anywhere in the word. So we must avoid R.\n\nSo, word ""saute"" does not contain R, and avoids C, R, N. It also has E at the end.\n\nIf we guess ""saute"":\n- If A gets a ✓ then we know A is at position 1. If A gets a - then we know A is not at position 1 but still in the word (so must be at position 2 or 4). It can\'t be at position 3 because from the first guess we know at position 3 it wasn\'t present (but actually the first guess had A at position 3 and got a minus meaning A is present but not there, so positions 1,2,4 are possible).\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word with A in position 2? Like ""PASTE""? But that has P, A at 2, S, T, E.\n\nBut note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother common word might be ""LEAST"", but it has L, E (at position 5 is fixed but we are putting E at 5? Actually LEAST has E at the end? Wait, LEAST is L,E,A,S,T -> positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T -> no E at the end? So we cannot use that because we know E is fixed at position 5. So the word must end with E.\n\nTherefore, we need a word that ends with E.\n\nSo options: 5-letter words ending in E and containing A (in positions 1,2, or 4).\n\nExamples:\n- A in position 1: AGATE, ABASE, etc. But let\'s avoid using letters we know are bad? We know C,R,N are bad. So AGATE? A, G, A, T, E -> but A repeated? We don\'t mind repetition if valid. But we can try.\n\nBut we also want to test new letters.\n\nSimilarly, A in position 4: words like BLARE, but we know R is bad so BLARE has R -> must avoid.\n\nSo BLAME? B-L-A-M-E -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:M, 5:E -> but A is at position 3? But remember our first guess had A at position 3 and got a minus meaning that A is not at position 3? Exactly! Because in ""CRANE"", A was at position 3 and it was marked as \'-\' meaning present but wrong position. That means in the secret word, A is present but not at position 3. So in BLAME, we are putting A at position 3 again, which we know is incorrect? Actually, we are allowed to put A there again? But it might give us a minus again? That wouldn\'t tell us anything new? Except that if we put A at position 3 and get a minus again, we don\'t learn anything. We already know it\'s not position 3.\n\nTherefore, we should avoid putting A in position 3 because we know it\'s wrong. The feedback for A was a minus meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So we can try A at other positions.\n\nSo let\'s try A at position 1 (like in ""AGATE"") or position 2 (like in ""PLATE"" but position 2 would be for PLATE: P-L-A-T-E -> A is in position 3? That\'s the same as above.\n\nWait, PLATE: P-L-A-T-E -> A is at index 3 (if we start at 1: P=1, L=2, A=3, T=4, E=5). And we know position 3 is bad for A.\n\nSo what about words with A at position 4? For example, ""CAUSE""? But C is already known to be absent? So CAUSE has C -> not allowed.\n\nWhat about ""SAUCE""? Also has C -> bad.\n\nHow about ""PAUSE"": P-A-U-S-E -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:U, 4:S, 5:E -> so A is at position 2? That\'s acceptable.\n\nAlso, ""STARE""? But R is absent? STARE has R -> bad.\n\nSo ""PAUSE"" is a candidate: P, A at position 2, U, S, E at position 5.\n\nSimilarly, ""SLATE"": S-L-A-T-E -> A at position 3? Again, bad.\n\nWhat about ""HASTE"": H-A-S-T-E -> A at position 2? That works.\n\nBut we don\'t know if H is in the word? That\'s what we test.\n\nWait, we know E is at position 5, so words ending in E.\n\nList: \n- with A at position 1: AGATE, ABASE, AWAKE, ADAGE, etc. But avoid C,R,N.\n- with A at position 2: BASTE, TASTE, PASTE? Wait, PASTE: P,A,S,T,E -> A at position 2? Yes. Similarly, MAIZE, but might be less common? Also has Z which is less common.\n\nAnother: PLACE? No C? PLACE has C and E? But C is bad? PLACE ends with E? Place: P L A C E -> so C at position 4? And we know C is bad -> avoid.\n\nSo acceptable words: \nFor A at position 1: AGATE (A,G,A,T,E) -> possible? A repeated? Actually, double A? That\'s okay. But we are testing G and T. Also, if the secret word has only one A, then if we have A at position 1, if it\'s correct we get ✓ for that A. But since there is a double A in AGATE, the feedback might show both A\'s? However, we only have one A in the secret word presumably? We don\'t know. But the word AGATE has A at positions 1 and 3? Position 3 is bad? We know position 3 is bad for A? Actually, we have A at position 1 and 3? We avoid position 3? Because we know position 3 is not correct. So then AGATE might be bad because we are putting A at position 3 again? But the feedback for position 3 might not be helpful? It will tell us if A is there or not? But we already know there is an A, so putting it at position 3 will give minus? That doesn\'t tell us new positions.\n\nInstead, we should try to put A in a new position: position 1 or 4? Position 4? Words with A at position 4.\n\nFor example, ""CAUSE"" has C -> bad.\n\n""HOUSE"": H-O-U-S-E -> no A -> must exclude.\n\nWe must have A in the word. So for words ending in E and having A not in position 3? So position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nPosition 4? That is, letter in position 4 is A? Then words like ...A followed by E? For example, ...AE? But E is fixed at the end. So words ending in AE? But then position 4: A and 5: E. Words: BLARE? Has R -> bad. SHADE? H-A-D-E? But positions: S=? H=? A=? D=? E? Wait, SHADE: S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> A at position 3? Bad.\n\nGLADE: G(1), L(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> A at 3? Bad.\n\nFLAKE? F(1),L(2),A(3),K(4),E(5) -> A at 3? Bad.\n\nSo it\'s hard to find words with A at position 4 that are common? Because of the pattern? Words ending in AE? But in English, words with AE ending are rare? Except for proper nouns? Most common words are like CAFE? But CAFE has E at end? But A is at position 2? CAFE: C(1),A(2),F(3),E(4) -> wait 4 letters? Five letters: CAFÉ? But normally we consider CAFE as 5? No, CAFE is 4 letters? We need 5 letters. So not.\n\nOther word? PLACE? Has C and A at position 3? Bad.\n\nPerhaps we should focus on position 2 for A? \n\nSo words with A at position 2 and ending in E? These are common? Like PASTE? PASTE: P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5). But note: position 3 is S? We don\'t care? And we avoid C,R,N? PASTE has no C,R,N? So acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, TASTE: T(1),A(2),S(3),T(4),E(5) -> T repeated? Might be okay? But less ideal? Because we are testing fewer letters?\n\nSimilarly, BASTE: B(1),A(2),S(3),T(4),E(5).\n\nAnother: HASTE: H(1),A(2),S(3),T(4),E(5).\n\nOr WAIVE: W(1),A(2),I(3),V(4),E(5)? But W is less common? WAIVE is valid.\n\nOr GAUZE? G(1),A(2),U(3),Z(4),E(5) -> U? Z? But less common.\n\nSo PASTE, HASTE, BASTE, TASTE? All acceptable.\n\nNow among these, we can pick one. Also, want to test new letters? The new letters in PASTE: P, A, S, T, E -> but E we already know? So testing P, S, T, and also A at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, HASTE: H, S, T.\n\nSame for others.\n\nWhat about ""SAUTE""? That we thought earlier? SAUTE: S(1),A(2),U(3),T(4),E(5) -> A at position 2? Actually, SAUTE is S-A-U-T-E -> position 2 is A? No: position 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:T, 5:E? So A at position 2? And S,U,T.\n\nSAUTE has no C,R,N.\n\nI think SAUTE is a good choice because it tests S,A,U,T,E? But E is known? But we put it again? That\'s okay? Actually, it will confirm E at position 5? Although we know? But it can help? But we are forced to put E at the end? So we don\'t test E again? We are testing the other letters.\n\nTherefore, let\'s go with ""saute"".\n\nSo our next guess: SAUTE\n\nThis way:\n- If A is at position 2, then we get A(✓) and we\'re happy? But note: A might be elsewhere? Actually, no, we are testing position 2? So if A is at position 2 then ✓? If not, then minus? And we know it\'s present? So it tells us if position 2 is correct or not? If minus then A is in the word but not at position 2? Then it must be at position 1 or 4? But position 4 we have T? So we can see.\n\nAlso, we test S, U, T.\n\nWhich of these can reveal new letters? \n\nAlternatively, we could choose PASTE: tests P and S,T? Or TASTE: T,A,S,T,E? Then T tested twice? Not ideal? Because we have a repeated T? Maybe avoid? Unless the first T is at position 1? And second at 4? \n\nBut SAUTE has all unique letters: S, A, U, T, E -> good.\n\nTherefore, I think SAUTE is a strong candidate.\n\nSo guess: SAUTE\n\nBut let me confirm spelling? SAUTE is a valid English word? Yes? As in cooking term? Saute.\n\nSo we\'ll go with that.\n\nThink step by step: \n\nWe have to include E at the end? Yes? Because we know E is at position 5? So SAUTE ends with E? Good.\n\nAlso avoids C, R, N? Good.\n\nTests S, A (at position 2?), U, T? Good.\n\nSo feedback from SAUTE will tell us:\n- S at position 1: could be x, ✓ or -? \n- A at position 2: ✓ or -? Because we know A is in the word? So either ✓ or -? But if A is at position 1, then S might be something? Actually, we don\'t know? But the symbols will tell.\n\nHence, I choose SAUTE.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- E is in the correct position (5th letter).\n- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.\n- C, R, and N are not in the word.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must end with E (position 5).\n- Must include A, but not in position 3.\n- Avoid C, R, and N.\n- Test new common letters like S, T, U to gather more information.\n\nI selected ""saute"" because:\n- It ends with E (satisfying the known E position).\n- Places A in position 2 (a new position to test after the 3rd position was ruled out).\n- Uses new letters S, U, T (common vowels/consonants not tested).\n- Avoids C, R, N.\n\nThis choice efficiently explores possible positions for A and tests multiple new letters.\n\n<guess>saute</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: saute -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'After the first guess ""crane"", we knew:\n-[ - ] C is not in the word (x)\n-[ - ] R is not in the word (x)\n-[ - ] A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3)\n-[ - ] N is not in the word (x)\n-[ ✓ ] E is in the word and correct position (position 5)\n\nSo the secret word has A and E, with E at the end. A is not at position 3, so it must be at 1, 2, or 4. And we avoid C, R, N.\n\nNow for the second guess ""saute"":\n-[ x ] S is not in the word\n-[ - ] A is in the word but wrong position (so not at position 2)\n-[ x ] U is not in the word\n-[ x ] T is not in the word\n-[ ✓ ] E is correct (position 5, as before)\n\nSo combining both feedbacks:\n- The word has E at position 5.\n- The word has A, but A is not at position 3 (from first guess) and not at position 2 (from second guess). So A must be at position 1 or 4.\n- Also, the word does not contain: C, R, N, S, U, T. \n\nNew list of absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T.\n\nNow, since A must be at position 1 or 4, and E is fixed at position 5.\n\nWe need to guess a word that:\n- Ends with E (position 5)\n- Contains A at either position 1 or position 4 (to test)\n- Avoids C, R, N, S, U, T.\n- Tests other new common letters, like L, I, O, D, G, B, P, M, etc.\n\nPossibilities for A:\n\nIf A at position 1: Words of form A _ _ E? But position 5 is E? So A word at position 1 and E at 5? Like A _ _ _ E? For example, AWAKE? But W and K? We are not avoiding them? But let\'s see available letters.\n\nFirst, what words are possible?\n\nWe know the word must include A at position 1 or 4? But also other letters? \n\nBut we have limited letters? We must avoid: C, R, N, S, U, T. So that leaves vowels: A, E already (A confirmed, E fixed), and other vowels? O, I? Or consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? \n\nSince we have few constraints? Especially because we don\'t know other letters? Except that there must be two more letters? Actually, between or around A and E? \n\nPerhaps we should guess a word that places A at position 1 to test? For example, guess a word starting with A and ending with E? With three letters in between? Avoid C,R,N,S,U,T? \n\nCommon words: ABASE? A B A S E? But S is not allowed? Because we learned from ""saute"" that S is absent? So ABASE has S → bad.\n\nADAGE? A D A G E → D, G? But A repeated? And second A at position 3? But we know position 3 should not have A? Since we ruled out position 3? Actually, the rule says A is present but not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3, it would be redundant? But ADAGE has A at 1 and 3? Position 1? Position 3? We know position 3 cannot be correct for A? So if we guess ADAGE, position 3 A would give a minus? Which doesn\'t help? Because we know A is not at position 3 anyway? But position 1 might be correct? \n\nBut ADAGE has D and G? New letters? And avoids C,R,N,S,U,T? So D and G are untested? Possible.\n\nBut two A\'s might confuse? Also, G? \n\nAnother word? AGAPE? A G A P E? Also has G,P? And A at 3? Similarly, position? But has S? No: AGAPE: A G A P E? No S? So possible? But G and P? Position 3 A.\n\nBut let\'s avoid putting A at position 3? Since we know it\'s wrong? So in ADAGE, we have A at position 1 and 3? We hope that A at 1 gets ✓? Or minus? While A at 3 will definitely get minus? Which is expected.\n\nSimilarly, AGAPE? Same thing.\n\nBut we might be able to use a word with A only once? At position 1? Without repeating A? \n\nFor example, ""ABATE""? A B A T E? But has T? Which we learned is absent? From ""saute"". T is absent? Yes from saute T(x) → so T is absent? Therefore, ABATE has T → bad.\n\n""ALIKE""? A L I K E? But A at position 1? L,I,K? Avoids? Yes: C,R,N,S,U,T are absent? So ALIKE: A L I K E? Positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:I, 4:K, 5:E? This places A at position 1? Which is a possibility? And tests L, I, K? Also E confirmed.\n\nSimilarly, ""AMIZE""? Not common? ""AMPLE""? But P,L? But ample ends with E? A M P L E? Positions: 1:A, 2:M, 3:P, 4:L, 5:E? Yes. \n\nBut we need to confirm? Ample is a valid word? Yes.\n\nOther words: ""AGILE""? A G I L E? Ends with E? Positions: 1:A, 2:G, 3:I, 4:L, 5:E? A at position 1? \n\nSimilarly, ""ALIVE""? A L I V E? Ends with E? Position 1:A? Then L,I,V? \n\nBut V? Less common? But valid? \n\nNow, what about A at position 4? Words where the fourth letter is A and fifth is E? Pattern: _ _ _ A E? \n\nBut such words? For example, ""OPAQUE""? Too long? 6 letters? Not. \n\n""FUGAE""? Not common? English words with AE ending? Like ""PLACE""? But has C? And we avoid C? Also less common? \n\n""BRAAE""? No? \n\n""ABASE""? But again S? Not allowed? \n\nPerhaps uncommon? So likely that A is at position 1? \n\nSince E is fixed? We can test position 1 for A? \n\nBut we must also consider that A might be at position 4? So we need to test? \n\nEither choose a word with A at position 1 to see? \n\nIf we choose ALIKE? Then:\n- If A at position 1 is correct, we get ✓? Otherwise minus? Which tells us if A is at 1 or 4? \n\nSimilarly, if minus, then A not at 1 and must be at position 4? Then we know? \n\nSo ALIVE? I will choose ALIVE? Because more common letters? L,I,V,E? \n\nBut V? Or ALIKE? With K? Prefer more common? \n\nCommon letters left: L, I, O, D, G, M, etc? \n\nWord ""ALIKE"": letters A,L,I,K,E? Avoids bad letters? Yes C,R,N,S,U,T? And K and L? \n\n""ALIVE"": A,L,I,V,E? V is less common? \n\nOr ""AGILE""? A,G,I,L,E? \n\nSince we have few constraints? But must include A? \n\nAlso, the word might have more revealed? \n\nBut from feedback, only A and E are known? Plus C,R,N,S,U,T absent? \n\nSo secret word: _ _ _ _ E, with A in position 1 or 4? And letters avoiding C,R,N,S,U,T? \n\nPossible letters: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,W,X,Y,Z? But E already? \n\nNow, we guess ALIKE? Or ABIDE? But ABIDE: A B I D E? D? Avoids? Yes? \n\nBut let\'s look? \n\nI think good? \n\nTo maximize letter testing? \n\nPerhaps choose a word with common vowels? Like I? \n\nAnd consonants? \n\nFor example, ""ABIDE"": A B I D E? Positions: A at 1? B and I and D? All new? \n\nBut avoid repeated letters? \n\nSimilarly, ""ALIKE"" : A L I K E? \n\nOr ""AMIDE""? A M I D E? \n\nAll possible? \n\nI\'ll go with ""alike""? But ALIKE? \n\nBut K is less common? \n\n""AMPLY""? No E? Not ending E? \n\n""APPLE""? A P P L E? But ends E? Positions: A at 1? Then P,P,L? Double P? Avoid? Because repeated? Might be inefficient? \n\nSo ""ALIKE"" seems fine? \n\nOr ""AGILE""? \n\nChoose ""agile"". \n\nAGILE: A G I L E? New letters G,I,L? \n\nIf G at position 2?, I at 3?, L at 4? \n\nThen feedback will tell? \n\nAlso for A: if A is at position 1? If we get ✓ then we know A position? If minus then we know A is at position 4? \n\nSo I choose ""agile"". \n\nAGILE? A-G-I-L-E? \n\nAvoids C,R,N,S,U,T? Yes. \n\nAvailable letters? Yes? \n\nSo guess: AGILE\n\nBut wait? AGILE has letter L! I\'m testing L? Good? \n\nSo step-by-step? \n\nWe need to confirm? \n\nAlso, E at 5? Yes? \n\nSo <guess>agile</guess> \n\nBut? Better? \n\nAnother word? Such as ""ABODE""?

We have feedback from three guesses:

1. **crane**: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
   - E is correct and in position 5.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - C, R, N are absent.

2. **saute**: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
   - E is correct (position 5).
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S, U, T are absent.

3. **agile**: A(✓) G(x) I(x) L(x) E(✓)
   - A is correct and in position 1 (since we got a check for A at position 1).
   - E is correct (position 5).
   - G, I, L are absent.

Now, combining all feedback:

- **Correct positions**:
  - Position 1: A (from agile: A(✓))
  - Position 5: E (consistent in all)

- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, U, T, G, I, L (all marked 'x' in at least one guess)

- **Present letters (but position unknown)**: 
  - We know A and E are present (with positions now confirmed: A at 1, E at 5).
  - From the first guess, we had A and E, but no other letters were indicated as present (only C, R, N were absent, and A was present but wrong position, which we now know is because it was in position 3 but actually belongs at position 1).
  - Similarly, in the second guess, only A and E were present (with A in wrong position, now we know it's because we put it at position 2 but it's at position 1).
  - In the third guess, only A and E are present (with A now correct at position 1, and E at 5, and G, I, L absent).

Therefore, the secret word must be of the form: A _ _ _ E

And the middle three letters (positions 2, 3, 4) must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list.

Absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T, G, I, L

So available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we also need to form a valid English word.

Moreover, we must consider that there might be other letters that are present? But from the feedback, in the first guess, only A and E were present (since C, R, N were absent and A was present but wrong position). Similarly, in the second guess, only A and E were present (S, U, T absent, A present but wrong position). In the third guess, only A and E were present (G, I, L absent). So it seems that the word only has A and E as the distinct letters? But wait, that would mean the word is A _ _ _ E, and the middle three are some letters, but we have three positions to fill.

But note: it is possible that one of the middle letters is repeated? But so far, we have no indication of repeated letters? But we don't know.

However, in the feedback, for the first guess, we had ""crane"" and only A and E were present? So the other letters (C, R, N) were absent, meaning they are not in the word. Similarly for the other guesses.

Therefore, the secret word has exactly two distinct letters that we know: A and E? But that can't be because we have three positions to fill? Unless there are repeated letters? But A and E are already used? So the middle three must be other letters that are not in the absent list? But we haven't tested them? So they could be any of the available letters.

But we must form a word. So we need to guess a word that starts with A, ends with E, and has three letters in between from the available set: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, common English words of this pattern:

- AWAKE: A W A K E -> but W and K are available? But note: it has A repeated? Position 1: A, position 2: W, position 3: A, position 4: K, position 5: E.

But we have to check if this is possible? The feedback from the first guess: when we guessed ""crane"", which had A at position 3, and we got a minus for A? But in ""AWAKE"", there is an A at position 3? So if the secret word is AWAKE, then when we guessed ""crane"", the A at position 3 should have been a minus? Which it was? And the A at position 1 of AWAKE was not tested? Similarly, in ""agile"", we put A at position 1 and got a check? Which would be correct? And E at 5? But in ""agile"", we had G, I, L which are absent? And in AWAKE, we have W, A, K? So G, I, L are not in AWAKE? So that would be consistent? But we need to see if the feedback for ""agile"" would be consistent? In ""agile"", we have A(✓) G(x) I(x) L(x) E(✓) — which matches if the word is AWAKE? Because A and E are correct, and G, I, L are absent.

Similarly, for ""saute"": S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓) — in AWAKE, there is no S, U, T? So they are absent? And A is at position 1, but we put it at position 2? So minus? Correct.

And for ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓) — C, R, N absent? A at position 3? But in AWAKE, there is an A at position 3? So it should be present? But we got a minus? Why? Because in ""crane"", we have A at position 3? But in the secret word AWAKE, A is at position 3? So it should be a check? But we got a minus? Contradiction?

Let me clarify:

- Secret word: A W A K E
- Guess ""crane"": C R A N E
  - C: not in word → x
  - R: not in word → x
  - A: at position 3? In secret word, position 3 is A? So it should be ✓? But in the feedback, we got A(-) meaning present but wrong position? But it is in the correct position? So it should be ✓? But it was given as minus? So inconsistency.

Therefore, AWAKE cannot be the word because the A at position 3 in ""crane"" would be correct? But we got a minus? So the secret word does not have A at position 3? But in AWAKE it does? So it must not be AWAKE.

Similarly, any word with A at position 3 is ruled out? Because we got a minus for A at position 3 in ""crane"", meaning that the secret word does not have A at position 3? But if it did, it would have been a check? So no, the secret word does not have A at position 3? So words like AWAKE are invalid.

Therefore, the secret word has A only at position 1? And E at position 5? And the middle three letters are not A? And not E? And not any of the absent letters.

So the word is A _ _ _ E, with positions 2,3,4 being letters that are not A, not E, and not in {C,R,N,S,U,T,G,I,L}.

Available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Now, we need to form a valid word. Common words:

- ABASE? But S is absent? Not allowed? S is in the absent list? From ""saute"" S(x)? So no.

- ABATE? T is absent? From ""saute"" T(x)? So no.

- ADAGE? G is absent? From ""agile"" G(x)? So no.

- AGAPE? G absent? No.

- ALIKE? I and L absent? From ""agile"" I(x) and L(x)? So no.

- ALIVE? I and L absent? No.

- AMAZE? M and Z? But Z is less common? Also, we have A at position 1? And E at 5? But AMAZE: A M A Z E? Has A at position 3? But we cannot have A at position 3? Because of the first guess? So invalid? Also, Z? And M? But let's not consider because of A at 3.

- AMBLE? B, L? But L absent? No.

- ANODE? N absent? From ""crane"" N(x)? No.

- APPLE? P, P, L? But L absent? No.

- ARISE? R and S absent? No.

- AWAKE? We saw issue? And has A at 3? Not allowed.

- AWARE? W, R? R absent? No.

- AZURE? Z, U, R? U and R absent? No.

So what words are possible?

- ABIDE? B, I, D? But I absent? From ""agile"" I(x)? So no.

- ABODE? B, O, D? O? Avoids absent letters? B, O, D are not in absent list? So ABODE: A B O D E? Positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:D, 5:E? This seems possible? Because B, O, D are available.

- ADOBE? A D O B E? But D, O, B? Same as above? But ADOBE: A D O B E? Positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:O, 4:B, 5:E? Also possible.

- AFOOT? Not ending with E? No.

- AGLET? G and L absent? No.

- ALOUD? L and U absent? No.

- AMONG? M, O, N? N absent? No.

- AMPLE? M, P, L? L absent? No.

- ANIME? N, I? Both absent? No.

- APHID? P, H, I? I absent? No.

- APPLE? L absent? No.

- ARBOR? R absent? No.

- ASIDE? S and I absent? No.

- ATONE? T and N absent? No.

- AWAIT? W, A, I? I absent? And no E? Not ending E? No.

- AWAKE? Invalid.

- AWARE? R absent? No.

- AXIOM? X, I, O? I absent? No.

- AZOIC? Z, O, I? I absent? No.

So possible words: ABODE and ADOBE? And perhaps others?

ABODE: A B O D E

ADOBE: A D O B E

Also, maybe ACODE? Not a word? Or AFOUL? No E? 

Another: AMOVE? Not common? 

BAKED? But B is not at start? We need A at start? 

So ABODE and ADOBE are candidates? 

Also, maybe AHOLE? But offensive? Not ideal? 

Or ABORE? But R absent? 

What about ""ABOVE""? A B O V E? Positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:V, 5:E? V is available? Not in absent list? So ABOVE? 

Similarly, ""ADORE""? But R absent? No. 

""AFIRE""? F, I, R? I and R absent? No. 

""AGONE""? G and N absent? No. 

""ALONE""? L and N absent? No. 

""AMORE""? M, O, R? R absent? No. 

""ANISE""? N and S absent? No. 

""APACE""? P, A, C? C absent? And A at 3? Not allowed? 

""AROSE""? R and S absent? No. 

""ATONE""? T and N absent? No. 

""AWAKE? Invalid. 

So ABOVE: A B O V E? With V? 

Also, ""ABYSS""? No E? 

""ACOLD""? C and L absent? No. 

So possible words: ABODE, ADOBE, ABOVE? 

ABODE: A B O D E 

ADOBE: A D O B E 

ABOVE: A B O V E 

All seem valid? 

Now, we need to choose one? But we don't have more information? So we can pick one? 

But we can also think of other words? Like ""AMOKE""? Not common? 

""JAPAN""? Not ending E? 

So among ABODE, ADOBE, ABOVE? 

ABODE and ADOBE have O and B and D? But in different positions? 

ABOVE has B, O, V? 

V is less common? So perhaps ABODE or ADOBE? 

But we need to guess? 

Since we have no information about positions 2,3,4? We can choose one arbitrarily? 

But let's see if we can get more information? 

We have to guess a word that uses new letters? 

But we have many available? 

Perhaps we can choose a word that tests multiple common letters? 

But B, O, D are common? 

In ABODE, we have B at position 2, O at 3, D at 4? 

In ADOBE, D at 2, O at 3, B at 4? 

In ABOVE, B at 2, O at 3, V at 4? 

V is less common? So perhaps ABODE or ADOBE? 

I'll go with ""abode""? 

But let's see the feedback we might get? 

We know A and E are fixed? So we are testing the middle three? 

If we guess ABODE: 

- Position 2: B? Could be x, ✓, or -? 

- Position 3: O? 

- Position 4: D? 

Similarly for others? 

But we have no prior? So we need to pick one? 

Perhaps we can consider that in the word, there might be no repeated letters? But we don't know? 

Another word: ""ADMIRE""? But M, I, R? I and R absent? No. 

""ADORE""? R absent? No. 

So I think ABODE is a good guess? 

But let's check if it conflicts? 

For example, if we guess ABODE, and the word is ADOBE? Then we get: 

- A: ✓ 

- B: at position 2? But in ADOBE, position 2 is D? So B would be x? Or if B is in the word? But ADOBE has B at position 4? So B would be present but wrong position? Minus? 

Similarly, O: at position 3? In ADOBE, O at position 3? So ✓? 

D: at position 4? In ADOBE, position 4 is B? So D would be? In ADOBE, D is at position 2? So if we put D at position 4, it might be minus? 

But we don't know? 

Similarly, E: ✓ 

So feedback: A(✓) B(-) O(✓) D(-) E(✓) ? 

But we can use that? 

But we are guessing to find the word? 

Since we have few options? We can guess ABODE? 

But let's see if there is a word that uses more common letters? 

Another possibility: ""ABIDE"" but I absent? Not. 

""ABOVE"" is another? 

But I think ABODE is fine. 

Perhaps ""AMPLE"" but L absent? No. 

So I choose ""abode"". 

But let's confirm the available letters? 

Absent: C, R, N, S, U, T, G, I, L 

So for ABODE: A, B, O, D, E? B, O, D are not in absent? So valid. 

Similarly, ADOBE: A, D, O, B, E? Same letters? 

ABOVE: A, B, O, V, E? V not absent? 

So all possible? 

But to decide, I'll go with ABODE. 

So guess: ABODE

But we can also think of ""MAYBE""? Not starting with A? 

So <guess>abode</guess> 

But let's see if there is a better word? 

Another word: ""AWOKE""? A W O K E? But O and K? And W? But K is available? But ""awoke"" has O at position 3? And E at 5? But positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:O, 4:K, 5:E? 

But we have to avoid? W and K are available? Not absent? 

But in the first guess, if the word is AWOKE, then ""crane"": C R A N E? A at position 3? In AWOKE, position 3 is O? Not A? So A is present but not at position 3? Which matches the minus? 

And E at 5? Check? 

In ""saute"": S A U T E? S, U, T absent? In AWOKE, no S,U,T? So x? A at position 2? But in AWOKE, position 2 is W? Not A? So A is present (at position 1) but not at 2? So minus? Correct? 

In ""agile"": A G I L E? A at position 1? In AWOKE, position 1 is A? So ✓? G,I,L absent? So x? E ✓? Correct? 

So AWOKE is also a possibility? 

Similarly, we have more words? 

AWOKE: A W O K E? 

And ABODE: A B O D E? 

ADOBE: A D O B E? 

ABOVE: A B O V E? 

And perhaps others? 

But AWOKE uses W and K? Which are less common? So perhaps ABODE is better? 

I think we should go with ABODE. 

So final decision: guess ""abode""
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback

Let's synthesize the feedback from all guesses to determine the constraints for the next guess:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)  
  - E is in the word and **correctly placed at position 5**.  
  - A is in the word but **not in position 3**.  
  - C, R, N are **absent** from the word.  

- **Guess 2: saute** → Feedback: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)  
  - E is **confirmed at position 5** (consistent with Guess 1).  
  - A is in the word but **not in position 2**.  
  - S, U, T are **absent**.  

- **Guess 3: agile** → Feedback: A(✓) G(x) I(x) L(x) E(✓)  
  - A is **correctly placed at position 1** (new information!).  
  - E is **confirmed at position 5**.  
  - G, I, L are **absent**.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed positions**:  
   - Position 1: **A** (from Guess 3).  
   - Position 5: **E** (consistent across all guesses).  
   - Thus, the word must start with **A** and end with **E**: `A _ _ _ E`.  

2. **Absent letters**:  
   - All guesses combined rule out: **C, R, N, S, U, T, G, I, L**.  
   - These letters cannot appear anywhere in the word.  

3. **A's position resolved**:  
   - A is fixed at position 1 (from Guess 3), so the earlier feedback about A (from Guess 1 and 2) is consistent: it was misplaced because it was guessed in positions 2 and 3, but it belongs at position 1.  

4. **Remaining letters**:  
   - The middle positions (2, 3, 4) must be filled with letters **not** in the absent list.  
   - Available letters: **B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  
   - The word must be a valid English word.  

5. **No other known letters**:  
   - Feedback from all guesses shows only A and E are present (no other ""✓"" or ""-"" symbols for other letters), so positions 2, 3, and 4 are unknown and must be filled from the available letters.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We need to test plausible words of the form `A _ _ _ E` using available letters.  
- Prioritize common letters (e.g., B, D, O, P, M) to maximize information gain.  
- Avoid repeating letters (no evidence of duplicates, so assume distinct letters for efficiency).  
- Possible candidate words:  
  - **ABODE** (A, B, O, D, E)  
  - **ADOBE** (A, D, O, B, E)  
  - **ABOVE** (A, B, O, V, E)  
  - **AWAKE** (invalid: A at position 3 conflicts with Guess 1 feedback)  
  - **ALIKE** (invalid: I and L absent)  
- **Why choose ABODE?**  
  - Tests common letters: B (position 2), O (position 3), D (position 4).  
  - Avoids rare letters (e.g., V in ABOVE, which is less common).  
  - If incorrect, feedback will reveal which of B, O, or D are present/absent and their positions, narrowing down possibilities (e.g., ADOBE or ABOVE).  

### Next Guess: ABODE
This guess adheres to all constraints and efficiently tests high-frequency letters in the middle positions.

<guess>abode</guess>",abode,"We have feedback from three guesses:

1. **crane**: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
   - E is correct and in position 5.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - C, R, N are absent.

2. **saute**: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
   - E is correct (position 5).
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S, U, T are absent.

3. **agile**: A(✓) G(x) I(x) L(x) E(✓)
   - A is correct and in position 1 (since we got a check for A at position 1).
   - E is correct (position 5).
   - G, I, L are absent.

Now, combining all feedback:

- **Correct positions**:
  - Position 1: A (from agile: A(✓))
  - Position 5: E (consistent in all)

- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, U, T, G, I, L (all marked 'x' in at least one guess)

- **Present letters (but position unknown)**: 
  - We know A and E are present (with positions now confirmed: A at 1, E at 5).
  - From the first guess, we had A and E, but no other letters were indicated as present (only C, R, N were absent, and A was present but wrong position, which we now know is because it was in position 3 but actually belongs at position 1).
  - Similarly, in the second guess, only A and E were present (with A in wrong position, now we know it's because we put it at position 2 but it's at position 1).
  - In the third guess, only A and E are present (with A now correct at position 1, and E at 5, and G, I, L absent).

Therefore, the secret word must be of the form: A _ _ _ E

And the middle three letters (positions 2, 3, 4) must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list.

Absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T, G, I, L

So available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we also need to form a valid English word.

Moreover, we must consider that there might be other letters that are present? But from the feedback, in the first guess, only A and E were present (since C, R, N were absent and A was present but wrong position). Similarly, in the second guess, only A and E were present (S, U, T absent, A present but wrong position). In the third guess, only A and E were present (G, I, L absent). So it seems that the word only has A and E as the distinct letters? But wait, that would mean the word is A _ _ _ E, and the middle three are some letters, but we have three positions to fill.

But note: it is possible that one of the middle letters is repeated? But so far, we have no indication of repeated letters? But we don't know.

However, in the feedback, for the first guess, we had ""crane"" and only A and E were present? So the other letters (C, R, N) were absent, meaning they are not in the word. Similarly for the other guesses.

Therefore, the secret word has exactly two distinct letters that we know: A and E? But that can't be because we have three positions to fill? Unless there are repeated letters? But A and E are already used? So the middle three must be other letters that are not in the absent list? But we haven't tested them? So they could be any of the available letters.

But we must form a word. So we need to guess a word that starts with A, ends with E, and has three letters in between from the available set: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, common English words of this pattern:

- AWAKE: A W A K E -> but W and K are available? But note: it has A repeated? Position 1: A, position 2: W, position 3: A, position 4: K, position 5: E.

But we have to check if this is possible? The feedback from the first guess: when we guessed ""crane"", which had A at position 3, and we got a minus for A? But in ""AWAKE"", there is an A at position 3? So if the secret word is AWAKE, then when we guessed ""crane"", the A at position 3 should have been a minus? Which it was? And the A at position 1 of AWAKE was not tested? Similarly, in ""agile"", we put A at position 1 and got a check? Which would be correct? And E at 5? But in ""agile"", we had G, I, L which are absent? And in AWAKE, we have W, A, K? So G, I, L are not in AWAKE? So that would be consistent? But we need to see if the feedback for ""agile"" would be consistent? In ""agile"", we have A(✓) G(x) I(x) L(x) E(✓) — which matches if the word is AWAKE? Because A and E are correct, and G, I, L are absent.

Similarly, for ""saute"": S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓) — in AWAKE, there is no S, U, T? So they are absent? And A is at position 1, but we put it at position 2? So minus? Correct.

And for ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓) — C, R, N absent? A at position 3? But in AWAKE, there is an A at position 3? So it should be present? But we got a minus? Why? Because in ""crane"", we have A at position 3? But in the secret word AWAKE, A is at position 3? So it should be a check? But we got a minus? Contradiction?

Let me clarify:

- Secret word: A W A K E
- Guess ""crane"": C R A N E
  - C: not in word → x
  - R: not in word → x
  - A: at position 3? In secret word, position 3 is A? So it should be ✓? But in the feedback, we got A(-) meaning present but wrong position? But it is in the correct position? So it should be ✓? But it was given as minus? So inconsistency.

Therefore, AWAKE cannot be the word because the A at position 3 in ""crane"" would be correct? But we got a minus? So the secret word does not have A at position 3? But in AWAKE it does? So it must not be AWAKE.

Similarly, any word with A at position 3 is ruled out? Because we got a minus for A at position 3 in ""crane"", meaning that the secret word does not have A at position 3? But if it did, it would have been a check? So no, the secret word does not have A at position 3? So words like AWAKE are invalid.

Therefore, the secret word has A only at position 1? And E at position 5? And the middle three letters are not A? And not E? And not any of the absent letters.

So the word is A _ _ _ E, with positions 2,3,4 being letters that are not A, not E, and not in {C,R,N,S,U,T,G,I,L}.

Available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Now, we need to form a valid word. Common words:

- ABASE? But S is absent? Not allowed? S is in the absent list? From ""saute"" S(x)? So no.

- ABATE? T is absent? From ""saute"" T(x)? So no.

- ADAGE? G is absent? From ""agile"" G(x)? So no.

- AGAPE? G absent? No.

- ALIKE? I and L absent? From ""agile"" I(x) and L(x)? So no.

- ALIVE? I and L absent? No.

- AMAZE? M and Z? But Z is less common? Also, we have A at position 1? And E at 5? But AMAZE: A M A Z E? Has A at position 3? But we cannot have A at position 3? Because of the first guess? So invalid? Also, Z? And M? But let's not consider because of A at 3.

- AMBLE? B, L? But L absent? No.

- ANODE? N absent? From ""crane"" N(x)? No.

- APPLE? P, P, L? But L absent? No.

- ARISE? R and S absent? No.

- AWAKE? We saw issue? And has A at 3? Not allowed.

- AWARE? W, R? R absent? No.

- AZURE? Z, U, R? U and R absent? No.

So what words are possible?

- ABIDE? B, I, D? But I absent? From ""agile"" I(x)? So no.

- ABODE? B, O, D? O? Avoids absent letters? B, O, D are not in absent list? So ABODE: A B O D E? Positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:D, 5:E? This seems possible? Because B, O, D are available.

- ADOBE? A D O B E? But D, O, B? Same as above? But ADOBE: A D O B E? Positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:O, 4:B, 5:E? Also possible.

- AFOOT? Not ending with E? No.

- AGLET? G and L absent? No.

- ALOUD? L and U absent? No.

- AMONG? M, O, N? N absent? No.

- AMPLE? M, P, L? L absent? No.

- ANIME? N, I? Both absent? No.

- APHID? P, H, I? I absent? No.

- APPLE? L absent? No.

- ARBOR? R absent? No.

- ASIDE? S and I absent? No.

- ATONE? T and N absent? No.

- AWAIT? W, A, I? I absent? And no E? Not ending E? No.

- AWAKE? Invalid.

- AWARE? R absent? No.

- AXIOM? X, I, O? I absent? No.

- AZOIC? Z, O, I? I absent? No.

So possible words: ABODE and ADOBE? And perhaps others?

ABODE: A B O D E

ADOBE: A D O B E

Also, maybe ACODE? Not a word? Or AFOUL? No E? 

Another: AMOVE? Not common? 

BAKED? But B is not at start? We need A at start? 

So ABODE and ADOBE are candidates? 

Also, maybe AHOLE? But offensive? Not ideal? 

Or ABORE? But R absent? 

What about ""ABOVE""? A B O V E? Positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:V, 5:E? V is available? Not in absent list? So ABOVE? 

Similarly, ""ADORE""? But R absent? No. 

""AFIRE""? F, I, R? I and R absent? No. 

""AGONE""? G and N absent? No. 

""ALONE""? L and N absent? No. 

""AMORE""? M, O, R? R absent? No. 

""ANISE""? N and S absent? No. 

""APACE""? P, A, C? C absent? And A at 3? Not allowed? 

""AROSE""? R and S absent? No. 

""ATONE""? T and N absent? No. 

""AWAKE? Invalid. 

So ABOVE: A B O V E? With V? 

Also, ""ABYSS""? No E? 

""ACOLD""? C and L absent? No. 

So possible words: ABODE, ADOBE, ABOVE? 

ABODE: A B O D E 

ADOBE: A D O B E 

ABOVE: A B O V E 

All seem valid? 

Now, we need to choose one? But we don't have more information? So we can pick one? 

But we can also think of other words? Like ""AMOKE""? Not common? 

""JAPAN""? Not ending E? 

So among ABODE, ADOBE, ABOVE? 

ABODE and ADOBE have O and B and D? But in different positions? 

ABOVE has B, O, V? 

V is less common? So perhaps ABODE or ADOBE? 

But we need to guess? 

Since we have no information about positions 2,3,4? We can choose one arbitrarily? 

But let's see if we can get more information? 

We have to guess a word that uses new letters? 

But we have many available? 

Perhaps we can choose a word that tests multiple common letters? 

But B, O, D are common? 

In ABODE, we have B at position 2, O at 3, D at 4? 

In ADOBE, D at 2, O at 3, B at 4? 

In ABOVE, B at 2, O at 3, V at 4? 

V is less common? So perhaps ABODE or ADOBE? 

I'll go with ""abode""? 

But let's see the feedback we might get? 

We know A and E are fixed? So we are testing the middle three? 

If we guess ABODE: 

- Position 2: B? Could be x, ✓, or -? 

- Position 3: O? 

- Position 4: D? 

Similarly for others? 

But we have no prior? So we need to pick one? 

Perhaps we can consider that in the word, there might be no repeated letters? But we don't know? 

Another word: ""ADMIRE""? But M, I, R? I and R absent? No. 

""ADORE""? R absent? No. 

So I think ABODE is a good guess? 

But let's check if it conflicts? 

For example, if we guess ABODE, and the word is ADOBE? Then we get: 

- A: ✓ 

- B: at position 2? But in ADOBE, position 2 is D? So B would be x? Or if B is in the word? But ADOBE has B at position 4? So B would be present but wrong position? Minus? 

Similarly, O: at position 3? In ADOBE, O at position 3? So ✓? 

D: at position 4? In ADOBE, position 4 is B? So D would be? In ADOBE, D is at position 2? So if we put D at position 4, it might be minus? 

But we don't know? 

Similarly, E: ✓ 

So feedback: A(✓) B(-) O(✓) D(-) E(✓) ? 

But we can use that? 

But we are guessing to find the word? 

Since we have few options? We can guess ABODE? 

But let's see if there is a word that uses more common letters? 

Another possibility: ""ABIDE"" but I absent? Not. 

""ABOVE"" is another? 

But I think ABODE is fine. 

Perhaps ""AMPLE"" but L absent? No. 

So I choose ""abode"". 

But let's confirm the available letters? 

Absent: C, R, N, S, U, T, G, I, L 

So for ABODE: A, B, O, D, E? B, O, D are not in absent? So valid. 

Similarly, ADOBE: A, D, O, B, E? Same letters? 

ABOVE: A, B, O, V, E? V not absent? 

So all possible? 

But to decide, I'll go with ABODE. 

So guess: ABODE

But we can also think of ""MAYBE""? Not starting with A? 

So <guess>abode</guess> 

But let's see if there is a better word? 

Another word: ""AWOKE""? A W O K E? But O and K? And W? But K is available? But ""awoke"" has O at position 3? And E at 5? But positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:O, 4:K, 5:E? 

But we have to avoid? W and K are available? Not absent? 

But in the first guess, if the word is AWOKE, then ""crane"": C R A N E? A at position 3? In AWOKE, position 3 is O? Not A? So A is present but not at position 3? Which matches the minus? 

And E at 5? Check? 

In ""saute"": S A U T E? S, U, T absent? In AWOKE, no S,U,T? So x? A at position 2? But in AWOKE, position 2 is W? Not A? So A is present (at position 1) but not at 2? So minus? Correct? 

In ""agile"": A G I L E? A at position 1? In AWOKE, position 1 is A? So ✓? G,I,L absent? So x? E ✓? Correct? 

So AWOKE is also a possibility? 

Similarly, we have more words? 

AWOKE: A W O K E? 

And ABODE: A B O D E? 

ADOBE: A D O B E? 

ABOVE: A B O V E? 

And perhaps others? 

But AWOKE uses W and K? Which are less common? So perhaps ABODE is better? 

I think we should go with ABODE. 

So final decision: guess ""abode""### Analysis of Previous Feedback

Let's synthesize the feedback from all guesses to determine the constraints for the next guess:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)  
  - E is in the word and **correctly placed at position 5**.  
  - A is in the word but **not in position 3**.  
  - C, R, N are **absent** from the word.  

- **Guess 2: saute** → Feedback: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)  
  - E is **confirmed at position 5** (consistent with Guess 1).  
  - A is in the word but **not in position 2**.  
  - S, U, T are **absent**.  

- **Guess 3: agile** → Feedback: A(✓) G(x) I(x) L(x) E(✓)  
  - A is **correctly placed at position 1** (new information!).  
  - E is **confirmed at position 5**.  
  - G, I, L are **absent**.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed positions**:  
   - Position 1: **A** (from Guess 3).  
   - Position 5: **E** (consistent across all guesses).  
   - Thus, the word must start with **A** and end with **E**: `A _ _ _ E`.  

2. **Absent letters**:  
   - All guesses combined rule out: **C, R, N, S, U, T, G, I, L**.  
   - These letters cannot appear anywhere in the word.  

3. **A's position resolved**:  
   - A is fixed at position 1 (from Guess 3), so the earlier feedback about A (from Guess 1 and 2) is consistent: it was misplaced because it was guessed in positions 2 and 3, but it belongs at position 1.  

4. **Remaining letters**:  
   - The middle positions (2, 3, 4) must be filled with letters **not** in the absent list.  
   - Available letters: **B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  
   - The word must be a valid English word.  

5. **No other known letters**:  
   - Feedback from all guesses shows only A and E are present (no other ""✓"" or ""-"" symbols for other letters), so positions 2, 3, and 4 are unknown and must be filled from the available letters.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We need to test plausible words of the form `A _ _ _ E` using available letters.  
- Prioritize common letters (e.g., B, D, O, P, M) to maximize information gain.  
- Avoid repeating letters (no evidence of duplicates, so assume distinct letters for efficiency).  
- Possible candidate words:  
  - **ABODE** (A, B, O, D, E)  
  - **ADOBE** (A, D, O, B, E)  
  - **ABOVE** (A, B, O, V, E)  
  - **AWAKE** (invalid: A at position 3 conflicts with Guess 1 feedback)  
  - **ALIKE** (invalid: I and L absent)  
- **Why choose ABODE?**  
  - Tests common letters: B (position 2), O (position 3), D (position 4).  
  - Avoids rare letters (e.g., V in ABOVE, which is less common).  
  - If incorrect, feedback will reveal which of B, O, or D are present/absent and their positions, narrowing down possibilities (e.g., ADOBE or ABOVE).  

### Next Guess: ABODE
This guess adheres to all constraints and efficiently tests high-frequency letters in the middle positions.",Guess 4: abode -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(✓) O(✓) D(x) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,above,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word that includes common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

This tells us:
- The letter E is in the word and is in the 5th position (since it's the last letter of ""crane"" and got a check).
- The letter A is in the word, but not in the 3rd position (because ""crane"" has A at position 3 and it got a minus).
- The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- E at the 5th position.
- A somewhere, but not in the 3rd position. It could be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Since A is present and not in position 3, and E is fixed at position 5, we can think of words that have A and E (with E at the end).

We must avoid using C, R, and N because they are not in the word.

Now, for the next guess, we want to test other common letters and also try to find the position for A.

We could try a word that:
- Ends with E (since E is fixed at position 5).
- Contains A in a different position (not position 3 and not in the same position as the previous A to test a new spot).
- Avoids C, R, N.

Also, we should include other common letters that we haven't tested yet to gather more information.

Common letters not yet tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, etc.

Since A is in the word, but we don't know where, we can try placing A in position 1 or 2 or 4.

Let's try to put A in position 1 for this guess, while keeping E at the end.

One common word is ""SAUTE"". This word has:
- S: untested
- A at position 1
- U: untested
- T: untested
- E at position 5 (fixed)

But note: we are also avoiding C, R, N, so S, U, T are okay.

However, we must consider the possibility that A might not be at position 1, but this guess will help us rule that in or out.

Another idea: we could try placing A in position 4, with words like ""PLATE"" but P and L are untested. Also note we have to avoid R, so plate has no R? Actually we know R is absent so that's okay? Wait, feedback for R was x, so R is not in the word? So indeed, avoid R.

But let me double-check: In the first guess, R was at position 2 and got an x, meaning R is not anywhere in the word. So we must avoid R.

So, word ""saute"" does not contain R, and avoids C, R, N. It also has E at the end.

If we guess ""saute"":
- If A gets a ✓ then we know A is at position 1. If A gets a - then we know A is not at position 1 but still in the word (so must be at position 2 or 4). It can't be at position 3 because from the first guess we know at position 3 it wasn't present (but actually the first guess had A at position 3 and got a minus meaning A is present but not there, so positions 1,2,4 are possible).

Alternatively, we could try a word with A in position 2? Like ""PASTE""? But that has P, A at 2, S, T, E.

But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another common word might be ""LEAST"", but it has L, E (at position 5 is fixed but we are putting E at 5? Actually LEAST has E at the end? Wait, LEAST is L,E,A,S,T -> positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T -> no E at the end? So we cannot use that because we know E is fixed at position 5. So the word must end with E.

Therefore, we need a word that ends with E.

So options: 5-letter words ending in E and containing A (in positions 1,2, or 4).

Examples:
- A in position 1: AGATE, ABASE, etc. But let's avoid using letters we know are bad? We know C,R,N are bad. So AGATE? A, G, A, T, E -> but A repeated? We don't mind repetition if valid. But we can try.

But we also want to test new letters.

Similarly, A in position 4: words like BLARE, but we know R is bad so BLARE has R -> must avoid.

So BLAME? B-L-A-M-E -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:M, 5:E -> but A is at position 3? But remember our first guess had A at position 3 and got a minus meaning that A is not at position 3? Exactly! Because in ""CRANE"", A was at position 3 and it was marked as '-' meaning present but wrong position. That means in the secret word, A is present but not at position 3. So in BLAME, we are putting A at position 3 again, which we know is incorrect? Actually, we are allowed to put A there again? But it might give us a minus again? That wouldn't tell us anything new? Except that if we put A at position 3 and get a minus again, we don't learn anything. We already know it's not position 3.

Therefore, we should avoid putting A in position 3 because we know it's wrong. The feedback for A was a minus meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So we can try A at other positions.

So let's try A at position 1 (like in ""AGATE"") or position 2 (like in ""PLATE"" but position 2 would be for PLATE: P-L-A-T-E -> A is in position 3? That's the same as above.

Wait, PLATE: P-L-A-T-E -> A is at index 3 (if we start at 1: P=1, L=2, A=3, T=4, E=5). And we know position 3 is bad for A.

So what about words with A at position 4? For example, ""CAUSE""? But C is already known to be absent? So CAUSE has C -> not allowed.

What about ""SAUCE""? Also has C -> bad.

How about ""PAUSE"": P-A-U-S-E -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:U, 4:S, 5:E -> so A is at position 2? That's acceptable.

Also, ""STARE""? But R is absent? STARE has R -> bad.

So ""PAUSE"" is a candidate: P, A at position 2, U, S, E at position 5.

Similarly, ""SLATE"": S-L-A-T-E -> A at position 3? Again, bad.

What about ""HASTE"": H-A-S-T-E -> A at position 2? That works.

But we don't know if H is in the word? That's what we test.

Wait, we know E is at position 5, so words ending in E.

List: 
- with A at position 1: AGATE, ABASE, AWAKE, ADAGE, etc. But avoid C,R,N.
- with A at position 2: BASTE, TASTE, PASTE? Wait, PASTE: P,A,S,T,E -> A at position 2? Yes. Similarly, MAIZE, but might be less common? Also has Z which is less common.

Another: PLACE? No C? PLACE has C and E? But C is bad? PLACE ends with E? Place: P L A C E -> so C at position 4? And we know C is bad -> avoid.

So acceptable words: 
For A at position 1: AGATE (A,G,A,T,E) -> possible? A repeated? Actually, double A? That's okay. But we are testing G and T. Also, if the secret word has only one A, then if we have A at position 1, if it's correct we get ✓ for that A. But since there is a double A in AGATE, the feedback might show both A's? However, we only have one A in the secret word presumably? We don't know. But the word AGATE has A at positions 1 and 3? Position 3 is bad? We know position 3 is bad for A? Actually, we have A at position 1 and 3? We avoid position 3? Because we know position 3 is not correct. So then AGATE might be bad because we are putting A at position 3 again? But the feedback for position 3 might not be helpful? It will tell us if A is there or not? But we already know there is an A, so putting it at position 3 will give minus? That doesn't tell us new positions.

Instead, we should try to put A in a new position: position 1 or 4? Position 4? Words with A at position 4.

For example, ""CAUSE"" has C -> bad.

""HOUSE"": H-O-U-S-E -> no A -> must exclude.

We must have A in the word. So for words ending in E and having A not in position 3? So position 1, 2, or 4.

Position 4? That is, letter in position 4 is A? Then words like ...A followed by E? For example, ...AE? But E is fixed at the end. So words ending in AE? But then position 4: A and 5: E. Words: BLARE? Has R -> bad. SHADE? H-A-D-E? But positions: S=? H=? A=? D=? E? Wait, SHADE: S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> A at position 3? Bad.

GLADE: G(1), L(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> A at 3? Bad.

FLAKE? F(1),L(2),A(3),K(4),E(5) -> A at 3? Bad.

So it's hard to find words with A at position 4 that are common? Because of the pattern? Words ending in AE? But in English, words with AE ending are rare? Except for proper nouns? Most common words are like CAFE? But CAFE has E at end? But A is at position 2? CAFE: C(1),A(2),F(3),E(4) -> wait 4 letters? Five letters: CAFÉ? But normally we consider CAFE as 5? No, CAFE is 4 letters? We need 5 letters. So not.

Other word? PLACE? Has C and A at position 3? Bad.

Perhaps we should focus on position 2 for A? 

So words with A at position 2 and ending in E? These are common? Like PASTE? PASTE: P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5). But note: position 3 is S? We don't care? And we avoid C,R,N? PASTE has no C,R,N? So acceptable.

Similarly, TASTE: T(1),A(2),S(3),T(4),E(5) -> T repeated? Might be okay? But less ideal? Because we are testing fewer letters?

Similarly, BASTE: B(1),A(2),S(3),T(4),E(5).

Another: HASTE: H(1),A(2),S(3),T(4),E(5).

Or WAIVE: W(1),A(2),I(3),V(4),E(5)? But W is less common? WAIVE is valid.

Or GAUZE? G(1),A(2),U(3),Z(4),E(5) -> U? Z? But less common.

So PASTE, HASTE, BASTE, TASTE? All acceptable.

Now among these, we can pick one. Also, want to test new letters? The new letters in PASTE: P, A, S, T, E -> but E we already know? So testing P, S, T, and also A at position 2.

Similarly, HASTE: H, S, T.

Same for others.

What about ""SAUTE""? That we thought earlier? SAUTE: S(1),A(2),U(3),T(4),E(5) -> A at position 2? Actually, SAUTE is S-A-U-T-E -> position 2 is A? No: position 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:T, 5:E? So A at position 2? And S,U,T.

SAUTE has no C,R,N.

I think SAUTE is a good choice because it tests S,A,U,T,E? But E is known? But we put it again? That's okay? Actually, it will confirm E at position 5? Although we know? But it can help? But we are forced to put E at the end? So we don't test E again? We are testing the other letters.

Therefore, let's go with ""saute"".

So our next guess: SAUTE

This way:
- If A is at position 2, then we get A(✓) and we're happy? But note: A might be elsewhere? Actually, no, we are testing position 2? So if A is at position 2 then ✓? If not, then minus? And we know it's present? So it tells us if position 2 is correct or not? If minus then A is in the word but not at position 2? Then it must be at position 1 or 4? But position 4 we have T? So we can see.

Also, we test S, U, T.

Which of these can reveal new letters? 

Alternatively, we could choose PASTE: tests P and S,T? Or TASTE: T,A,S,T,E? Then T tested twice? Not ideal? Because we have a repeated T? Maybe avoid? Unless the first T is at position 1? And second at 4? 

But SAUTE has all unique letters: S, A, U, T, E -> good.

Therefore, I think SAUTE is a strong candidate.

So guess: SAUTE

But let me confirm spelling? SAUTE is a valid English word? Yes? As in cooking term? Saute.

So we'll go with that.

Think step by step: 

We have to include E at the end? Yes? Because we know E is at position 5? So SAUTE ends with E? Good.

Also avoids C, R, N? Good.

Tests S, A (at position 2?), U, T? Good.

So feedback from SAUTE will tell us:
- S at position 1: could be x, ✓ or -? 
- A at position 2: ✓ or -? Because we know A is in the word? So either ✓ or -? But if A is at position 1, then S might be something? Actually, we don't know? But the symbols will tell.

Hence, I choose SAUTE.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is in the correct position (5th letter).
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- C, R, and N are not in the word.

For the second guess:
- The word must end with E (position 5).
- Must include A, but not in position 3.
- Avoid C, R, and N.
- Test new common letters like S, T, U to gather more information.

I selected ""saute"" because:
- It ends with E (satisfying the known E position).
- Places A in position 2 (a new position to test after the 3rd position was ruled out).
- Uses new letters S, U, T (common vowels/consonants not tested).
- Avoids C, R, N.

This choice efficiently explores possible positions for A and tests multiple new letters.

Guess 2: saute -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>After the first guess ""crane"", we knew:
-[ - ] C is not in the word (x)
-[ - ] R is not in the word (x)
-[ - ] A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3)
-[ - ] N is not in the word (x)
-[ ✓ ] E is in the word and correct position (position 5)

So the secret word has A and E, with E at the end. A is not at position 3, so it must be at 1, 2, or 4. And we avoid C, R, N.

Now for the second guess ""saute"":
-[ x ] S is not in the word
-[ - ] A is in the word but wrong position (so not at position 2)
-[ x ] U is not in the word
-[ x ] T is not in the word
-[ ✓ ] E is correct (position 5, as before)

So combining both feedbacks:
- The word has E at position 5.
- The word has A, but A is not at position 3 (from first guess) and not at position 2 (from second guess). So A must be at position 1 or 4.
- Also, the word does not contain: C, R, N, S, U, T. 

New list of absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T.

Now, since A must be at position 1 or 4, and E is fixed at position 5.

We need to guess a word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Contains A at either position 1 or position 4 (to test)
- Avoids C, R, N, S, U, T.
- Tests other new common letters, like L, I, O, D, G, B, P, M, etc.

Possibilities for A:

If A at position 1: Words of form A _ _ E? But position 5 is E? So A word at position 1 and E at 5? Like A _ _ _ E? For example, AWAKE? But W and K? We are not avoiding them? But let's see available letters.

First, what words are possible?

We know the word must include A at position 1 or 4? But also other letters? 

But we have limited letters? We must avoid: C, R, N, S, U, T. So that leaves vowels: A, E already (A confirmed, E fixed), and other vowels? O, I? Or consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

Since we have few constraints? Especially because we don't know other letters? Except that there must be two more letters? Actually, between or around A and E? 

Perhaps we should guess a word that places A at position 1 to test? For example, guess a word starting with A and ending with E? With three letters in between? Avoid C,R,N,S,U,T? 

Common words: ABASE? A B A S E? But S is not allowed? Because we learned from ""saute"" that S is absent? So ABASE has S → bad.

ADAGE? A D A G E → D, G? But A repeated? And second A at position 3? But we know position 3 should not have A? Since we ruled out position 3? Actually, the rule says A is present but not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3, it would be redundant? But ADAGE has A at 1 and 3? Position 1? Position 3? We know position 3 cannot be correct for A? So if we guess ADAGE, position 3 A would give a minus? Which doesn't help? Because we know A is not at position 3 anyway? But position 1 might be correct? 

But ADAGE has D and G? New letters? And avoids C,R,N,S,U,T? So D and G are untested? Possible.

But two A's might confuse? Also, G? 

Another word? AGAPE? A G A P E? Also has G,P? And A at 3? Similarly, position? But has S? No: AGAPE: A G A P E? No S? So possible? But G and P? Position 3 A.

But let's avoid putting A at position 3? Since we know it's wrong? So in ADAGE, we have A at position 1 and 3? We hope that A at 1 gets ✓? Or minus? While A at 3 will definitely get minus? Which is expected.

Similarly, AGAPE? Same thing.

But we might be able to use a word with A only once? At position 1? Without repeating A? 

For example, ""ABATE""? A B A T E? But has T? Which we learned is absent? From ""saute"". T is absent? Yes from saute T(x) → so T is absent? Therefore, ABATE has T → bad.

""ALIKE""? A L I K E? But A at position 1? L,I,K? Avoids? Yes: C,R,N,S,U,T are absent? So ALIKE: A L I K E? Positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:I, 4:K, 5:E? This places A at position 1? Which is a possibility? And tests L, I, K? Also E confirmed.

Similarly, ""AMIZE""? Not common? ""AMPLE""? But P,L? But ample ends with E? A M P L E? Positions: 1:A, 2:M, 3:P, 4:L, 5:E? Yes. 

But we need to confirm? Ample is a valid word? Yes.

Other words: ""AGILE""? A G I L E? Ends with E? Positions: 1:A, 2:G, 3:I, 4:L, 5:E? A at position 1? 

Similarly, ""ALIVE""? A L I V E? Ends with E? Position 1:A? Then L,I,V? 

But V? Less common? But valid? 

Now, what about A at position 4? Words where the fourth letter is A and fifth is E? Pattern: _ _ _ A E? 

But such words? For example, ""OPAQUE""? Too long? 6 letters? Not. 

""FUGAE""? Not common? English words with AE ending? Like ""PLACE""? But has C? And we avoid C? Also less common? 

""BRAAE""? No? 

""ABASE""? But again S? Not allowed? 

Perhaps uncommon? So likely that A is at position 1? 

Since E is fixed? We can test position 1 for A? 

But we must also consider that A might be at position 4? So we need to test? 

Either choose a word with A at position 1 to see? 

If we choose ALIKE? Then:
- If A at position 1 is correct, we get ✓? Otherwise minus? Which tells us if A is at 1 or 4? 

Similarly, if minus, then A not at 1 and must be at position 4? Then we know? 

So ALIVE? I will choose ALIVE? Because more common letters? L,I,V,E? 

But V? Or ALIKE? With K? Prefer more common? 

Common letters left: L, I, O, D, G, M, etc? 

Word ""ALIKE"": letters A,L,I,K,E? Avoids bad letters? Yes C,R,N,S,U,T? And K and L? 

""ALIVE"": A,L,I,V,E? V is less common? 

Or ""AGILE""? A,G,I,L,E? 

Since we have few constraints? But must include A? 

Also, the word might have more revealed? 

But from feedback, only A and E are known? Plus C,R,N,S,U,T absent? 

So secret word: _ _ _ _ E, with A in position 1 or 4? And letters avoiding C,R,N,S,U,T? 

Possible letters: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,W,X,Y,Z? But E already? 

Now, we guess ALIKE? Or ABIDE? But ABIDE: A B I D E? D? Avoids? Yes? 

But let's look? 

I think good? 

To maximize letter testing? 

Perhaps choose a word with common vowels? Like I? 

And consonants? 

For example, ""ABIDE"": A B I D E? Positions: A at 1? B and I and D? All new? 

But avoid repeated letters? 

Similarly, ""ALIKE"" : A L I K E? 

Or ""AMIDE""? A M I D E? 

All possible? 

I'll go with ""alike""? But ALIKE? 

But K is less common? 

""AMPLY""? No E? Not ending E? 

""APPLE""? A P P L E? But ends E? Positions: A at 1? Then P,P,L? Double P? Avoid? Because repeated? Might be inefficient? 

So ""ALIKE"" seems fine? 

Or ""AGILE""? 

Choose ""agile"". 

AGILE: A G I L E? New letters G,I,L? 

If G at position 2?, I at 3?, L at 4? 

Then feedback will tell? 

Also for A: if A is at position 1? If we get ✓ then we know A position? If minus then we know A is at position 4? 

So I choose ""agile"". 

AGILE? A-G-I-L-E? 

Avoids C,R,N,S,U,T? Yes. 

Available letters? Yes? 

So guess: AGILE

But wait? AGILE has letter L! I'm testing L? Good? 

So step-by-step? 

We need to confirm? 

Also, E at 5? Yes? 

So <guess>agile</guess> 

But? Better? 

Another word? Such as ""ABODE""? A B O D E? Avoids? Yes? And tests O? 

But also B,O,D? 

But O? 

We have fewer vowels tested? So testing I? And G? In AGILE? 

I think AGILE is fine. 

Therefore:After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: ""C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)"" 
- **Guess 2: saute** → Feedback: ""S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)""

We can deduce:
1. **E is confirmed at position 5** (from both guesses).
2. **A is in the word** but not in position 3 (from crane) or position 2 (from saute). Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 4.
3. **Absent letters:** C, R, N, S, U, T (marked as ""x"" in feedback). These cannot be in the word.
4. **Other constraints:** The word must have exactly one A (since repeated A would not be consistent with feedback), and E is fixed at the end.

For the next guess:
- Focus on placing **A in position 1 or 4** to resolve its location.
- Use **new, common letters** not yet tested (e.g., G, I, L, D, O, M, P) to maximize information gain.
- Avoid known absent letters (C, R, N, S, U, T).

After considering possible words:
- **Selected guess: AGILE** 
  - Why?  
    - Positions: A at position 1 (tests A placement), G at 2, I at 3, L at 4, E at 5 (fixed).
    - Tests A in position 1 explicitly. If A is here, it will show ""✓""; if not, it confirms A must be at position 4.
    - Introduces three new common letters (G, I, L) for additional clues.
    - Avoids all absent letters and has no conflicts.
    - Example alternatives like ALIKE or ABIDE were less ideal (K is less common; D and B are good but provide similar coverage).

This guess efficiently balances resolving the A position while covering new letters.

<guess>agile</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: saute -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: agile -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) G(x) I(x) L(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

1. **crane**: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
   - E is correct and in position 5.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - C, R, N are absent.

2. **saute**: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
   - E is correct (position 5).
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S, U, T are absent.

3. **agile**: A(✓) G(x) I(x) L(x) E(✓)
   - A is correct and in position 1 (since we got a check for A at position 1).
   - E is correct (position 5).
   - G, I, L are absent.

Now, combining all feedback:

- **Correct positions**:
  - Position 1: A (from agile: A(✓))
  - Position 5: E (consistent in all)

- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, U, T, G, I, L (all marked 'x' in at least one guess)

- **Present letters (but position unknown)**: 
  - We know A and E are present (with positions now confirmed: A at 1, E at 5).
  - From the first guess, we had A and E, but no other letters were indicated as present (only C, R, N were absent, and A was present but wrong position, which we now know is because it was in position 3 but actually belongs at position 1).
  - Similarly, in the second guess, only A and E were present (with A in wrong position, now we know it's because we put it at position 2 but it's at position 1).
  - In the third guess, only A and E are present (with A now correct at position 1, and E at 5, and G, I, L absent).

Therefore, the secret word must be of the form: A _ _ _ E

And the middle three letters (positions 2, 3, 4) must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list.

Absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T, G, I, L

So available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we also need to form a valid English word.

Moreover, we must consider that there might be other letters that are present? But from the feedback, in the first guess, only A and E were present (since C, R, N were absent and A was present but wrong position). Similarly, in the second guess, only A and E were present (S, U, T absent, A present but wrong position). In the third guess, only A and E were present (G, I, L absent). So it seems that the word only has A and E as the distinct letters? But wait, that would mean the word is A _ _ _ E, and the middle three are some letters, but we have three positions to fill.

But note: it is possible that one of the middle letters is repeated? But so far, we have no indication of repeated letters? But we don't know.

However, in the feedback, for the first guess, we had ""crane"" and only A and E were present? So the other letters (C, R, N) were absent, meaning they are not in the word. Similarly for the other guesses.

Therefore, the secret word has exactly two distinct letters that we know: A and E? But that can't be because we have three positions to fill? Unless there are repeated letters? But A and E are already used? So the middle three must be other letters that are not in the absent list? But we haven't tested them? So they could be any of the available letters.

But we must form a word. So we need to guess a word that starts with A, ends with E, and has three letters in between from the available set: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, common English words of this pattern:

- AWAKE: A W A K E -> but W and K are available? But note: it has A repeated? Position 1: A, position 2: W, position 3: A, position 4: K, position 5: E.

But we have to check if this is possible? The feedback from the first guess: when we guessed ""crane"", which had A at position 3, and we got a minus for A? But in ""AWAKE"", there is an A at position 3? So if the secret word is AWAKE, then when we guessed ""crane"", the A at position 3 should have been a minus? Which it was? And the A at position 1 of AWAKE was not tested? Similarly, in ""agile"", we put A at position 1 and got a check? Which would be correct? And E at 5? But in ""agile"", we had G, I, L which are absent? And in AWAKE, we have W, A, K? So G, I, L are not in AWAKE? So that would be consistent? But we need to see if the feedback for ""agile"" would be consistent? In ""agile"", we have A(✓) G(x) I(x) L(x) E(✓) — which matches if the word is AWAKE? Because A and E are correct, and G, I, L are absent.

Similarly, for ""saute"": S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓) — in AWAKE, there is no S, U, T? So they are absent? And A is at position 1, but we put it at position 2? So minus? Correct.

And for ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓) — C, R, N absent? A at position 3? But in AWAKE, there is an A at position 3? So it should be present? But we got a minus? Why? Because in ""crane"", we have A at position 3? But in the secret word AWAKE, A is at position 3? So it should be a check? But we got a minus? Contradiction?

Let me clarify:

- Secret word: A W A K E
- Guess ""crane"": C R A N E
  - C: not in word → x
  - R: not in word → x
  - A: at position 3? In secret word, position 3 is A? So it should be ✓? But in the feedback, we got A(-) meaning present but wrong position? But it is in the correct position? So it should be ✓? But it was given as minus? So inconsistency.

Therefore, AWAKE cannot be the word because the A at position 3 in ""crane"" would be correct? But we got a minus? So the secret word does not have A at position 3? But in AWAKE it does? So it must not be AWAKE.

Similarly, any word with A at position 3 is ruled out? Because we got a minus for A at position 3 in ""crane"", meaning that the secret word does not have A at position 3? But if it did, it would have been a check? So no, the secret word does not have A at position 3? So words like AWAKE are invalid.

Therefore, the secret word has A only at position 1? And E at position 5? And the middle three letters are not A? And not E? And not any of the absent letters.

So the word is A _ _ _ E, with positions 2,3,4 being letters that are not A, not E, and not in {C,R,N,S,U,T,G,I,L}.

Available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Now, we need to form a valid word. Common words:

- ABASE? But S is absent? Not allowed? S is in the absent list? From ""saute"" S(x)? So no.

- ABATE? T is absent? From ""saute"" T(x)? So no.

- ADAGE? G is absent? From ""agile"" G(x)? So no.

- AGAPE? G absent? No.

- ALIKE? I and L absent? From ""agile"" I(x) and L(x)? So no.

- ALIVE? I and L absent? No.

- AMAZE? M and Z? But Z is less common? Also, we have A at position 1? And E at 5? But AMAZE: A M A Z E? Has A at position 3? But we cannot have A at position 3? Because of the first guess? So invalid? Also, Z? And M? But let's not consider because of A at 3.

- AMBLE? B, L? But L absent? No.

- ANODE? N absent? From ""crane"" N(x)? No.

- APPLE? P, P, L? But L absent? No.

- ARISE? R and S absent? No.

- AWAKE? We saw issue? And has A at 3? Not allowed.

- AWARE? W, R? R absent? No.

- AZURE? Z, U, R? U and R absent? No.

So what words are possible?

- ABIDE? B, I, D? But I absent? From ""agile"" I(x)? So no.

- ABODE? B, O, D? O? Avoids absent letters? B, O, D are not in absent list? So ABODE: A B O D E? Positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:D, 5:E? This seems possible? Because B, O, D are available.

- ADOBE? A D O B E? But D, O, B? Same as above? But ADOBE: A D O B E? Positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:O, 4:B, 5:E? Also possible.

- AFOOT? Not ending with E? No.

- AGLET? G and L absent? No.

- ALOUD? L and U absent? No.

- AMONG? M, O, N? N absent? No.

- AMPLE? M, P, L? L absent? No.

- ANIME? N, I? Both absent? No.

- APHID? P, H, I? I absent? No.

- APPLE? L absent? No.

- ARBOR? R absent? No.

- ASIDE? S and I absent? No.

- ATONE? T and N absent? No.

- AWAIT? W, A, I? I absent? And no E? Not ending E? No.

- AWAKE? Invalid.

- AWARE? R absent? No.

- AXIOM? X, I, O? I absent? No.

- AZOIC? Z, O, I? I absent? No.

So possible words: ABODE and ADOBE? And perhaps others?

ABODE: A B O D E

ADOBE: A D O B E

Also, maybe ACODE? Not a word? Or AFOUL? No E? 

Another: AMOVE? Not common? 

BAKED? But B is not at start? We need A at start? 

So ABODE and ADOBE are candidates? 

Also, maybe AHOLE? But offensive? Not ideal? 

Or ABORE? But R absent? 

What about ""ABOVE""? A B O V E? Positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:V, 5:E? V is available? Not in absent list? So ABOVE? 

Similarly, ""ADORE""? But R absent? No. 

""AFIRE""? F, I, R? I and R absent? No. 

""AGONE""? G and N absent? No. 

""ALONE""? L and N absent? No. 

""AMORE""? M, O, R? R absent? No. 

""ANISE""? N and S absent? No. 

""APACE""? P, A, C? C absent? And A at 3? Not allowed? 

""AROSE""? R and S absent? No. 

""ATONE""? T and N absent? No. 

""AWAKE? Invalid. 

So ABOVE: A B O V E? With V? 

Also, ""ABYSS""? No E? 

""ACOLD""? C and L absent? No. 

So possible words: ABODE, ADOBE, ABOVE? 

ABODE: A B O D E 

ADOBE: A D O B E 

ABOVE: A B O V E 

All seem valid? 

Now, we need to choose one? But we don't have more information? So we can pick one? 

But we can also think of other words? Like ""AMOKE""? Not common? 

""JAPAN""? Not ending E? 

So among ABODE, ADOBE, ABOVE? 

ABODE and ADOBE have O and B and D? But in different positions? 

ABOVE has B, O, V? 

V is less common? So perhaps ABODE or ADOBE? 

But we need to guess? 

Since we have no information about positions 2,3,4? We can choose one arbitrarily? 

But let's see if we can get more information? 

We have to guess a word that uses new letters? 

But we have many available? 

Perhaps we can choose a word that tests multiple common letters? 

But B, O, D are common? 

In ABODE, we have B at position 2, O at 3, D at 4? 

In ADOBE, D at 2, O at 3, B at 4? 

In ABOVE, B at 2, O at 3, V at 4? 

V is less common? So perhaps ABODE or ADOBE? 

I'll go with ""abode""? 

But let's see the feedback we might get? 

We know A and E are fixed? So we are testing the middle three? 

If we guess ABODE: 

- Position 2: B? Could be x, ✓, or -? 

- Position 3: O? 

- Position 4: D? 

Similarly for others? 

But we have no prior? So we need to pick one? 

Perhaps we can consider that in the word, there might be no repeated letters? But we don't know? 

Another word: ""ADMIRE""? But M, I, R? I and R absent? No. 

""ADORE""? R absent? No. 

So I think ABODE is a good guess? 

But let's check if it conflicts? 

For example, if we guess ABODE, and the word is ADOBE? Then we get: 

- A: ✓ 

- B: at position 2? But in ADOBE, position 2 is D? So B would be x? Or if B is in the word? But ADOBE has B at position 4? So B would be present but wrong position? Minus? 

Similarly, O: at position 3? In ADOBE, O at position 3? So ✓? 

D: at position 4? In ADOBE, position 4 is B? So D would be? In ADOBE, D is at position 2? So if we put D at position 4, it might be minus? 

But we don't know? 

Similarly, E: ✓ 

So feedback: A(✓) B(-) O(✓) D(-) E(✓) ? 

But we can use that? 

But we are guessing to find the word? 

Since we have few options? We can guess ABODE? 

But let's see if there is a word that uses more common letters? 

Another possibility: ""ABIDE"" but I absent? Not. 

""ABOVE"" is another? 

But I think ABODE is fine. 

Perhaps ""AMPLE"" but L absent? No. 

So I choose ""abode"". 

But let's confirm the available letters? 

Absent: C, R, N, S, U, T, G, I, L 

So for ABODE: A, B, O, D, E? B, O, D are not in absent? So valid. 

Similarly, ADOBE: A, D, O, B, E? Same letters? 

ABOVE: A, B, O, V, E? V not absent? 

So all possible? 

But to decide, I'll go with ABODE. 

So guess: ABODE

But we can also think of ""MAYBE""? Not starting with A? 

So <guess>abode</guess> 

But let's see if there is a better word? 

Another word: ""AWOKE""? A W O K E? But O and K? And W? But K is available? But ""awoke"" has O at position 3? And E at 5? But positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:O, 4:K, 5:E? 

But we have to avoid? W and K are available? Not absent? 

But in the first guess, if the word is AWOKE, then ""crane"": C R A N E? A at position 3? In AWOKE, position 3 is O? Not A? So A is present but not at position 3? Which matches the minus? 

And E at 5? Check? 

In ""saute"": S A U T E? S, U, T absent? In AWOKE, no S,U,T? So x? A at position 2? But in AWOKE, position 2 is W? Not A? So A is present (at position 1) but not at 2? So minus? Correct? 

In ""agile"": A G I L E? A at position 1? In AWOKE, position 1 is A? So ✓? G,I,L absent? So x? E ✓? Correct? 

So AWOKE is also a possibility? 

Similarly, we have more words? 

AWOKE: A W O K E? 

And ABODE: A B O D E? 

ADOBE: A D O B E? 

ABOVE: A B O V E? 

And perhaps others? 

But AWOKE uses W and K? Which are less common? So perhaps ABODE is better? 

I think we should go with ABODE. 

So final decision: guess ""abode""### Analysis of Previous Feedback

Let's synthesize the feedback from all guesses to determine the constraints for the next guess:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)  
  - E is in the word and **correctly placed at position 5**.  
  - A is in the word but **not in position 3**.  
  - C, R, N are **absent** from the word.  

- **Guess 2: saute** → Feedback: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)  
  - E is **confirmed at position 5** (consistent with Guess 1).  
  - A is in the word but **not in position 2**.  
  - S, U, T are **absent**.  

- **Guess 3: agile** → Feedback: A(✓) G(x) I(x) L(x) E(✓)  
  - A is **correctly placed at position 1** (new information!).  
  - E is **confirmed at position 5**.  
  - G, I, L are **absent**.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed positions**:  
   - Position 1: **A** (from Guess 3).  
   - Position 5: **E** (consistent across all guesses).  
   - Thus, the word must start with **A** and end with **E**: `A _ _ _ E`.  

2. **Absent letters**:  
   - All guesses combined rule out: **C, R, N, S, U, T, G, I, L**.  
   - These letters cannot appear anywhere in the word.  

3. **A's position resolved**:  
   - A is fixed at position 1 (from Guess 3), so the earlier feedback about A (from Guess 1 and 2) is consistent: it was misplaced because it was guessed in positions 2 and 3, but it belongs at position 1.  

4. **Remaining letters**:  
   - The middle positions (2, 3, 4) must be filled with letters **not** in the absent list.  
   - Available letters: **B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  
   - The word must be a valid English word.  

5. **No other known letters**:  
   - Feedback from all guesses shows only A and E are present (no other ""✓"" or ""-"" symbols for other letters), so positions 2, 3, and 4 are unknown and must be filled from the available letters.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We need to test plausible words of the form `A _ _ _ E` using available letters.  
- Prioritize common letters (e.g., B, D, O, P, M) to maximize information gain.  
- Avoid repeating letters (no evidence of duplicates, so assume distinct letters for efficiency).  
- Possible candidate words:  
  - **ABODE** (A, B, O, D, E)  
  - **ADOBE** (A, D, O, B, E)  
  - **ABOVE** (A, B, O, V, E)  
  - **AWAKE** (invalid: A at position 3 conflicts with Guess 1 feedback)  
  - **ALIKE** (invalid: I and L absent)  
- **Why choose ABODE?**  
  - Tests common letters: B (position 2), O (position 3), D (position 4).  
  - Avoids rare letters (e.g., V in ABOVE, which is less common).  
  - If incorrect, feedback will reveal which of B, O, or D are present/absent and their positions, narrowing down possibilities (e.g., ADOBE or ABOVE).  

### Next Guess: ABODE
This guess adheres to all constraints and efficiently tests high-frequency letters in the middle positions.

It could be in position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nSince A is present and not in position 3, and E is fixed at position 5, we can think of words that have A and E (with E at the end).\n\nWe must avoid using C, R, and N because they are not in the word.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we want to test other common letters and also try to find the position for A.\n\nWe could try a word that:\n- Ends with E (since E is fixed at position 5).\n- Contains A in a different position (not position 3 and not in the same position as the previous A to test a new spot).\n- Avoids C, R, N.\n\nAlso, we should include other common letters that we haven\'t tested yet to gather more information.\n\nCommon letters not yet tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, etc.\n\nSince A is in the word, but we don\'t know where, we can try placing A in position 1 or 2 or 4.\n\nLet\'s try to put A in position 1 for this guess, while keeping E at the end.\n\nOne common word is ""SAUTE"". This word has:\n- S: untested\n- A at position 1\n- U: untested\n- T: untested\n- E at position 5 (fixed)\n\nBut note: we are also avoiding C, R, N, so S, U, T are okay.\n\nHowever, we must consider the possibility that A might not be at position 1, but this guess will help us rule that in or out.\n\nAnother idea: we could try placing A in position 4, with words like ""PLATE"" but P and L are untested. Also note we have to avoid R, so plate has no R? Actually we know R is absent so that\'s okay? Wait, feedback for R was x, so R is not in the word? So indeed, avoid R.\n\nBut let me double-check: In the first guess, R was at position 2 and got an x, meaning R is not anywhere in the word. So we must avoid R.\n\nSo, word ""saute"" does not contain R, and avoids C, R, N. It also has E at the end.\n\nIf we guess ""saute"":\n- If A gets a ✓ then we know A is at position 1. If A gets a - then we know A is not at position 1 but still in the word (so must be at position 2 or 4). It can\'t be at position 3 because from the first guess we know at position 3 it wasn\'t present (but actually the first guess had A at position 3 and got a minus meaning A is present but not there, so positions 1,2,4 are possible).\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word with A in position 2? Like ""PASTE""? But that has P, A at 2, S, T, E.\n\nBut note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother common word might be ""LEAST"", but it has L, E (at position 5 is fixed but we are putting E at 5? Actually LEAST has E at the end? Wait, LEAST is L,E,A,S,T -> positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T -> no E at the end? So we cannot use that because we know E is fixed at position 5. So the word must end with E.\n\nTherefore, we need a word that ends with E.\n\nSo options: 5-letter words ending in E and containing A (in positions 1,2, or 4).\n\nExamples:\n- A in position 1: AGATE, ABASE, etc. But let\'s avoid using letters we know are bad? We know C,R,N are bad. So AGATE? A, G, A, T, E -> but A repeated? We don\'t mind repetition if valid. But we can try.\n\nBut we also want to test new letters.\n\nSimilarly, A in position 4: words like BLARE, but we know R is bad so BLARE has R -> must avoid.\n\nSo BLAME? B-L-A-M-E -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:M, 5:E -> but A is at position 3? But remember our first guess had A at position 3 and got a minus meaning that A is not at position 3? Exactly! Because in ""CRANE"", A was at position 3 and it was marked as \'-\' meaning present but wrong position. That means in the secret word, A is present but not at position 3. So in BLAME, we are putting A at position 3 again, which we know is incorrect? Actually, we are allowed to put A there again? But it might give us a minus again? That wouldn\'t tell us anything new? Except that if we put A at position 3 and get a minus again, we don\'t learn anything. We already know it\'s not position 3.\n\nTherefore, we should avoid putting A in position 3 because we know it\'s wrong. The feedback for A was a minus meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So we can try A at other positions.\n\nSo let\'s try A at position 1 (like in ""AGATE"") or position 2 (like in ""PLATE"" but position 2 would be for PLATE: P-L-A-T-E -> A is in position 3? That\'s the same as above.\n\nWait, PLATE: P-L-A-T-E -> A is at index 3 (if we start at 1: P=1, L=2, A=3, T=4, E=5). And we know position 3 is bad for A.\n\nSo what about words with A at position 4? For example, ""CAUSE""? But C is already known to be absent? So CAUSE has C -> not allowed.\n\nWhat about ""SAUCE""? Also has C -> bad.\n\nHow about ""PAUSE"": P-A-U-S-E -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:U, 4:S, 5:E -> so A is at position 2? That\'s acceptable.\n\nAlso, ""STARE""? But R is absent? STARE has R -> bad.\n\nSo ""PAUSE"" is a candidate: P, A at position 2, U, S, E at position 5.\n\nSimilarly, ""SLATE"": S-L-A-T-E -> A at position 3? Again, bad.\n\nWhat about ""HASTE"": H-A-S-T-E -> A at position 2? That works.\n\nBut we don\'t know if H is in the word? That\'s what we test.\n\nWait, we know E is at position 5, so words ending in E.\n\nList: \n- with A at position 1: AGATE, ABASE, AWAKE, ADAGE, etc. But avoid C,R,N.\n- with A at position 2: BASTE, TASTE, PASTE? Wait, PASTE: P,A,S,T,E -> A at position 2? Yes. Similarly, MAIZE, but might be less common? Also has Z which is less common.\n\nAnother: PLACE? No C? PLACE has C and E? But C is bad? PLACE ends with E? Place: P L A C E -> so C at position 4? And we know C is bad -> avoid.\n\nSo acceptable words: \nFor A at position 1: AGATE (A,G,A,T,E) -> possible? A repeated? Actually, double A? That\'s okay. But we are testing G and T. Also, if the secret word has only one A, then if we have A at position 1, if it\'s correct we get ✓ for that A. But since there is a double A in AGATE, the feedback might show both A\'s? However, we only have one A in the secret word presumably? We don\'t know. But the word AGATE has A at positions 1 and 3? Position 3 is bad? We know position 3 is bad for A? Actually, we have A at position 1 and 3? We avoid position 3? Because we know position 3 is not correct. So then AGATE might be bad because we are putting A at position 3 again? But the feedback for position 3 might not be helpful? It will tell us if A is there or not? But we already know there is an A, so putting it at position 3 will give minus? That doesn\'t tell us new positions.\n\nInstead, we should try to put A in a new position: position 1 or 4? Position 4? Words with A at position 4.\n\nFor example, ""CAUSE"" has C -> bad.\n\n""HOUSE"": H-O-U-S-E -> no A -> must exclude.\n\nWe must have A in the word. So for words ending in E and having A not in position 3? So position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nPosition 4? That is, letter in position 4 is A? Then words like ...A followed by E? For example, ...AE? But E is fixed at the end. So words ending in AE? But then position 4: A and 5: E. Words: BLARE? Has R -> bad. SHADE? H-A-D-E? But positions: S=? H=? A=? D=? E? Wait, SHADE: S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> A at position 3? Bad.\n\nGLADE: G(1), L(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> A at 3? Bad.\n\nFLAKE? F(1),L(2),A(3),K(4),E(5) -> A at 3? Bad.\n\nSo it\'s hard to find words with A at position 4 that are common? Because of the pattern? Words ending in AE? But in English, words with AE ending are rare? Except for proper nouns? Most common words are like CAFE? But CAFE has E at end? But A is at position 2? CAFE: C(1),A(2),F(3),E(4) -> wait 4 letters? Five letters: CAFÉ? But normally we consider CAFE as 5? No, CAFE is 4 letters? We need 5 letters. So not.\n\nOther word? PLACE? Has C and A at position 3? Bad.\n\nPerhaps we should focus on position 2 for A? \n\nSo words with A at position 2 and ending in E? These are common? Like PASTE? PASTE: P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5). But note: position 3 is S? We don\'t care? And we avoid C,R,N? PASTE has no C,R,N? So acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, TASTE: T(1),A(2),S(3),T(4),E(5) -> T repeated? Might be okay? But less ideal? Because we are testing fewer letters?\n\nSimilarly, BASTE: B(1),A(2),S(3),T(4),E(5).\n\nAnother: HASTE: H(1),A(2),S(3),T(4),E(5).\n\nOr WAIVE: W(1),A(2),I(3),V(4),E(5)? But W is less common? WAIVE is valid.\n\nOr GAUZE? G(1),A(2),U(3),Z(4),E(5) -> U? Z? But less common.\n\nSo PASTE, HASTE, BASTE, TASTE? All acceptable.\n\nNow among these, we can pick one. Also, want to test new letters? The new letters in PASTE: P, A, S, T, E -> but E we already know? So testing P, S, T, and also A at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, HASTE: H, S, T.\n\nSame for others.\n\nWhat about ""SAUTE""? That we thought earlier? SAUTE: S(1),A(2),U(3),T(4),E(5) -> A at position 2? Actually, SAUTE is S-A-U-T-E -> position 2 is A? No: position 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:T, 5:E? So A at position 2? And S,U,T.\n\nSAUTE has no C,R,N.\n\nI think SAUTE is a good choice because it tests S,A,U,T,E? But E is known? But we put it again? That\'s okay? Actually, it will confirm E at position 5? Although we know? But it can help? But we are forced to put E at the end? So we don\'t test E again? We are testing the other letters.\n\nTherefore, let\'s go with ""saute"".\n\nSo our next guess: SAUTE\n\nThis way:\n- If A is at position 2, then we get A(✓) and we\'re happy? But note: A might be elsewhere? Actually, no, we are testing position 2? So if A is at position 2 then ✓? If not, then minus? And we know it\'s present? So it tells us if position 2 is correct or not? If minus then A is in the word but not at position 2? Then it must be at position 1 or 4? But position 4 we have T? So we can see.\n\nAlso, we test S, U, T.\n\nWhich of these can reveal new letters? \n\nAlternatively, we could choose PASTE: tests P and S,T? Or TASTE: T,A,S,T,E? Then T tested twice? Not ideal? Because we have a repeated T? Maybe avoid? Unless the first T is at position 1? And second at 4? \n\nBut SAUTE has all unique letters: S, A, U, T, E -> good.\n\nTherefore, I think SAUTE is a strong candidate.\n\nSo guess: SAUTE\n\nBut let me confirm spelling? SAUTE is a valid English word? Yes? As in cooking term? Saute.\n\nSo we\'ll go with that.\n\nThink step by step: \n\nWe have to include E at the end? Yes? Because we know E is at position 5? So SAUTE ends with E? Good.\n\nAlso avoids C, R, N? Good.\n\nTests S, A (at position 2?), U, T? Good.\n\nSo feedback from SAUTE will tell us:\n- S at position 1: could be x, ✓ or -? \n- A at position 2: ✓ or -? Because we know A is in the word? So either ✓ or -? But if A is at position 1, then S might be something? Actually, we don\'t know? But the symbols will tell.\n\nHence, I choose SAUTE.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- E is in the correct position (5th letter).\n- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.\n- C, R, and N are not in the word.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must end with E (position 5).\n- Must include A, but not in position 3.\n- Avoid C, R, and N.\n- Test new common letters like S, T, U to gather more information.\n\nI selected ""saute"" because:\n- It ends with E (satisfying the known E position).\n- Places A in position 2 (a new position to test after the 3rd position was ruled out).\n- Uses new letters S, U, T (common vowels/consonants not tested).\n- Avoids C, R, N.\n\nThis choice efficiently explores possible positions for A and tests multiple new letters.\n\n<guess>saute</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: saute -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'After the first guess ""crane"", we knew:\n-[ - ] C is not in the word (x)\n-[ - ] R is not in the word (x)\n-[ - ] A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3)\n-[ - ] N is not in the word (x)\n-[ ✓ ] E is in the word and correct position (position 5)\n\nSo the secret word has A and E, with E at the end. A is not at position 3, so it must be at 1, 2, or 4. And we avoid C, R, N.\n\nNow for the second guess ""saute"":\n-[ x ] S is not in the word\n-[ - ] A is in the word but wrong position (so not at position 2)\n-[ x ] U is not in the word\n-[ x ] T is not in the word\n-[ ✓ ] E is correct (position 5, as before)\n\nSo combining both feedbacks:\n- The word has E at position 5.\n- The word has A, but A is not at position 3 (from first guess) and not at position 2 (from second guess). So A must be at position 1 or 4.\n- Also, the word does not contain: C, R, N, S, U, T. \n\nNew list of absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T.\n\nNow, since A must be at position 1 or 4, and E is fixed at position 5.\n\nWe need to guess a word that:\n- Ends with E (position 5)\n- Contains A at either position 1 or position 4 (to test)\n- Avoids C, R, N, S, U, T.\n- Tests other new common letters, like L, I, O, D, G, B, P, M, etc.\n\nPossibilities for A:\n\nIf A at position 1: Words of form A _ _ E? But position 5 is E? So A word at position 1 and E at 5? Like A _ _ _ E? For example, AWAKE? But W and K? We are not avoiding them? But let\'s see available letters.\n\nFirst, what words are possible?\n\nWe know the word must include A at position 1 or 4? But also other letters? \n\nBut we have limited letters? We must avoid: C, R, N, S, U, T. So that leaves vowels: A, E already (A confirmed, E fixed), and other vowels? O, I? Or consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? \n\nSince we have few constraints? Especially because we don\'t know other letters? Except that there must be two more letters? Actually, between or around A and E? \n\nPerhaps we should guess a word that places A at position 1 to test? For example, guess a word starting with A and ending with E? With three letters in between? Avoid C,R,N,S,U,T? \n\nCommon words: ABASE? A B A S E? But S is not allowed? Because we learned from ""saute"" that S is absent? So ABASE has S → bad.\n\nADAGE? A D A G E → D, G? But A repeated? And second A at position 3? But we know position 3 should not have A? Since we ruled out position 3? Actually, the rule says A is present but not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3, it would be redundant? But ADAGE has A at 1 and 3? Position 1? Position 3? We know position 3 cannot be correct for A? So if we guess ADAGE, position 3 A would give a minus? Which doesn\'t help? Because we know A is not at position 3 anyway? But position 1 might be correct? \n\nBut ADAGE has D and G? New letters? And avoids C,R,N,S,U,T? So D and G are untested? Possible.\n\nBut two A\'s might confuse? Also, G? \n\nAnother word? AGAPE? A G A P E? Also has G,P? And A at 3? Similarly, position? But has S? No: AGAPE: A G A P E? No S? So possible? But G and P? Position 3 A.\n\nBut let\'s avoid putting A at position 3? Since we know it\'s wrong? So in ADAGE, we have A at position 1 and 3? We hope that A at 1 gets ✓? Or minus? While A at 3 will definitely get minus? Which is expected.\n\nSimilarly, AGAPE? Same thing.\n\nBut we might be able to use a word with A only once? At position 1? Without repeating A? \n\nFor example, ""ABATE""? A B A T E? But has T? Which we learned is absent? From ""saute"". T is absent? Yes from saute T(x) → so T is absent? Therefore, ABATE has T → bad.\n\n""ALIKE""? A L I K E? But A at position 1? L,I,K? Avoids? Yes: C,R,N,S,U,T are absent? So ALIKE: A L I K E? Positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:I, 4:K, 5:E? This places A at position 1? Which is a possibility? And tests L, I, K? Also E confirmed.\n\nSimilarly, ""AMIZE""? Not common? ""AMPLE""? But P,L? But ample ends with E? A M P L E? Positions: 1:A, 2:M, 3:P, 4:L, 5:E? Yes. \n\nBut we need to confirm? Ample is a valid word? Yes.\n\nOther words: ""AGILE""? A G I L E? Ends with E? Positions: 1:A, 2:G, 3:I, 4:L, 5:E? A at position 1? \n\nSimilarly, ""ALIVE""? A L I V E? Ends with E? Position 1:A? Then L,I,V? \n\nBut V? Less common? But valid? \n\nNow, what about A at position 4? Words where the fourth letter is A and fifth is E? Pattern: _ _ _ A E? \n\nBut such words? For example, ""OPAQUE""? Too long? 6 letters? Not. \n\n""FUGAE""? Not common? English words with AE ending? Like ""PLACE""? But has C? And we avoid C? Also less common? \n\n""BRAAE""? No? \n\n""ABASE""? But again S? Not allowed? \n\nPerhaps uncommon? So likely that A is at position 1? \n\nSince E is fixed? We can test position 1 for A? \n\nBut we must also consider that A might be at position 4? So we need to test? \n\nEither choose a word with A at position 1 to see? \n\nIf we choose ALIKE? Then:\n- If A at position 1 is correct, we get ✓? Otherwise minus? Which tells us if A is at 1 or 4? \n\nSimilarly, if minus, then A not at 1 and must be at position 4? Then we know? \n\nSo ALIVE? I will choose ALIVE? Because more common letters? L,I,V,E? \n\nBut V? Or ALIKE? With K? Prefer more common? \n\nCommon letters left: L, I, O, D, G, M, etc? \n\nWord ""ALIKE"": letters A,L,I,K,E? Avoids bad letters? Yes C,R,N,S,U,T? And K and L? \n\n""ALIVE"": A,L,I,V,E? V is less common? \n\nOr ""AGILE""? A,G,I,L,E? \n\nSince we have few constraints? But must include A? \n\nAlso, the word might have more revealed? \n\nBut from feedback, only A and E are known? Plus C,R,N,S,U,T absent? \n\nSo secret word: _ _ _ _ E, with A in position 1 or 4? And letters avoiding C,R,N,S,U,T? \n\nPossible letters: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,W,X,Y,Z? But E already? \n\nNow, we guess ALIKE? Or ABIDE? But ABIDE: A B I D E? D? Avoids? Yes? \n\nBut let\'s look? \n\nI think good? \n\nTo maximize letter testing? \n\nPerhaps choose a word with common vowels? Like I? \n\nAnd consonants? \n\nFor example, ""ABIDE"": A B I D E? Positions: A at 1? B and I and D? All new? \n\nBut avoid repeated letters? \n\nSimilarly, ""ALIKE"" : A L I K E? \n\nOr ""AMIDE""? A M I D E? \n\nAll possible? \n\nI\'ll go with ""alike""? But ALIKE? \n\nBut K is less common? \n\n""AMPLY""? No E? Not ending E? \n\n""APPLE""? A P P L E? But ends E? Positions: A at 1? Then P,P,L? Double P? Avoid? Because repeated? Might be inefficient? \n\nSo ""ALIKE"" seems fine? \n\nOr ""AGILE""? \n\nChoose ""agile"". \n\nAGILE: A G I L E? New letters G,I,L? \n\nIf G at position 2?, I at 3?, L at 4? \n\nThen feedback will tell? \n\nAlso for A: if A is at position 1? If we get ✓ then we know A position? If minus then we know A is at position 4? \n\nSo I choose ""agile"". \n\nAGILE? A-G-I-L-E? \n\nAvoids C,R,N,S,U,T? Yes. \n\nAvailable letters? Yes? \n\nSo guess: AGILE\n\nBut wait? AGILE has letter L! I\'m testing L? Good? \n\nSo step-by-step? \n\nWe need to confirm? \n\nAlso, E at 5? Yes? \n\nSo <guess>agile</guess> \n\nBut? Better? \n\nAnother word? Such as ""ABODE""? A B O D E? Avoids? Yes? And tests O? \n\nBut also B,O,D? \n\nBut O? \n\nWe have fewer vowels tested? So testing I? And G? In AGILE? \n\nI think AGILE is fine. \n\nTherefore:After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: ""C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)"" \n- **Guess 2: saute** → Feedback: ""S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)""\n\nWe can deduce:\n1. **E is confirmed at position 5** (from both guesses).\n2. **A is in the word** but not in position 3 (from crane) or position 2 (from saute). Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 4.\n3. **Absent letters:** C, R, N, S, U, T (marked as ""x"" in feedback). These cannot be in the word.\n4. **Other constraints:** The word must have exactly one A (since repeated A would not be consistent with feedback), and E is fixed at the end.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Focus on placing **A in position 1 or 4** to resolve its location.\n- Use **new, common letters** not yet tested (e.g., G, I, L, D, O, M, P) to maximize information gain.\n- Avoid known absent letters (C, R, N, S, U, T).\n\nAfter considering possible words:\n- **Selected guess: AGILE** \n  - Why?  \n    - Positions: A at position 1 (tests A placement), G at 2, I at 3, L at 4, E at 5 (fixed).\n    - Tests A in position 1 explicitly. If A is here, it will show ""✓""; if not, it confirms A must be at position 4.\n    - Introduces three new common letters (G, I, L) for additional clues.\n    - Avoids all absent letters and has no conflicts.\n    - Example alternatives like ALIKE or ABIDE were less ideal (K is less common; D and B are good but provide similar coverage).\n\nThis guess efficiently balances resolving the A position while covering new letters.\n\n<guess>agile</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: saute -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: agile -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) G(x) I(x) L(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\n1. **crane**: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\n   - E is correct and in position 5.\n   - A is in the word but not in position 3.\n   - C, R, N are absent.\n\n2. **saute**: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)\n   - E is correct (position 5).\n   - A is in the word but not in position 2.\n   - S, U, T are absent.\n\n3. **agile**: A(✓) G(x) I(x) L(x) E(✓)\n   - A is correct and in position 1 (since we got a check for A at position 1).\n   - E is correct (position 5).\n   - G, I, L are absent.\n\nNow, combining all feedback:\n\n- **Correct positions**:\n  - Position 1: A (from agile: A(✓))\n  - Position 5: E (consistent in all)\n\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, U, T, G, I, L (all marked \'x\' in at least one guess)\n\n- **Present letters (but position unknown)**: \n  - We know A and E are present (with positions now confirmed: A at 1, E at 5).\n  - From the first guess, we had A and E, but no other letters were indicated as present (only C, R, N were absent, and A was present but wrong position, which we now know is because it was in position 3 but actually belongs at position 1).\n  - Similarly, in the second guess, only A and E were present (with A in wrong position, now we know it\'s because we put it at position 2 but it\'s at position 1).\n  - In the third guess, only A and E are present (with A now correct at position 1, and E at 5, and G, I, L absent).\n\nTherefore, the secret word must be of the form: A _ _ _ E\n\nAnd the middle three letters (positions 2, 3, 4) must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list.\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T, G, I, L\n\nSo available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut we also need to form a valid English word.\n\nMoreover, we must consider that there might be other letters that are present? But from the feedback, in the first guess, only A and E were present (since C, R, N were absent and A was present but wrong position). Similarly, in the second guess, only A and E were present (S, U, T absent, A present but wrong position). In the third guess, only A and E were present (G, I, L absent). So it seems that the word only has A and E as the distinct letters? But wait, that would mean the word is A _ _ _ E, and the middle three are some letters, but we have three positions to fill.\n\nBut note: it is possible that one of the middle letters is repeated? But so far, we have no indication of repeated letters? But we don\'t know.\n\nHowever, in the feedback, for the first guess, we had ""crane"" and only A and E were present? So the other letters (C, R, N) were absent, meaning they are not in the word. Similarly for the other guesses.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has exactly two distinct letters that we know: A and E? But that can\'t be because we have three positions to fill? Unless there are repeated letters? But A and E are already used? So the middle three must be other letters that are not in the absent list? But we haven\'t tested them? So they could be any of the available letters.\n\nBut we must form a word. So we need to guess a word that starts with A, ends with E, and has three letters in between from the available set: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nNow, common English words of this pattern:\n\n- AWAKE: A W A K E -> but W and K are available? But note: it has A repeated? Position 1: A, position 2: W, position 3: A, position 4: K, position 5: E.\n\nBut we have to check if this is possible? The feedback from the first guess: when we guessed ""crane"", which had A at position 3, and we got a minus for A? But in ""AWAKE"", there is an A at position 3? So if the secret word is AWAKE, then when we guessed ""crane"", the A at position 3 should have been a minus? Which it was? And the A at position 1 of AWAKE was not tested? Similarly, in ""agile"", we put A at position 1 and got a check? Which would be correct? And E at 5? But in ""agile"", we had G, I, L which are absent? And in AWAKE, we have W, A, K? So G, I, L are not in AWAKE? So that would be consistent? But we need to see if the feedback for ""agile"" would be consistent? In ""agile"", we have A(✓) G(x) I(x) L(x) E(✓) — which matches if the word is AWAKE? Because A and E are correct, and G, I, L are absent.\n\nSimilarly, for ""saute"": S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓) — in AWAKE, there is no S, U, T? So they are absent? And A is at position 1, but we put it at position 2? So minus? Correct.\n\nAnd for ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓) — C, R, N absent? A at position 3? But in AWAKE, there is an A at position 3? So it should be present? But we got a minus? Why? Because in ""crane"", we have A at position 3? But in the secret word AWAKE, A is at position 3? So it should be a check? But we got a minus? Contradiction?\n\nLet me clarify:\n\n- Secret word: A W A K E\n- Guess ""crane"": C R A N E\n  - C: not in word → x\n  - R: not in word → x\n  - A: at position 3? In secret word, position 3 is A? So it should be ✓? But in the feedback, we got A(-) meaning present but wrong position? But it is in the correct position? So it should be ✓? But it was given as minus? So inconsistency.\n\nTherefore, AWAKE cannot be the word because the A at position 3 in ""crane"" would be correct? But we got a minus? So the secret word does not have A at position 3? But in AWAKE it does? So it must not be AWAKE.\n\nSimilarly, any word with A at position 3 is ruled out? Because we got a minus for A at position 3 in ""crane"", meaning that the secret word does not have A at position 3? But if it did, it would have been a check? So no, the secret word does not have A at position 3? So words like AWAKE are invalid.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has A only at position 1? And E at position 5? And the middle three letters are not A? And not E? And not any of the absent letters.\n\nSo the word is A _ _ _ E, with positions 2,3,4 being letters that are not A, not E, and not in {C,R,N,S,U,T,G,I,L}.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nNow, we need to form a valid word. Common words:\n\n- ABASE? But S is absent? Not allowed? S is in the absent list? From ""saute"" S(x)? So no.\n\n- ABATE? T is absent? From ""saute"" T(x)? So no.\n\n- ADAGE? G is absent? From ""agile"" G(x)? So no.\n\n- AGAPE? G absent? No.\n\n- ALIKE? I and L absent? From ""agile"" I(x) and L(x)? So no.\n\n- ALIVE? I and L absent? No.\n\n- AMAZE? M and Z? But Z is less common? Also, we have A at position 1? And E at 5? But AMAZE: A M A Z E? Has A at position 3? But we cannot have A at position 3? Because of the first guess? So invalid? Also, Z? And M? But let\'s not consider because of A at 3.\n\n- AMBLE? B, L? But L absent? No.\n\n- ANODE? N absent? From ""crane"" N(x)? No.\n\n- APPLE? P, P, L? But L absent? No.\n\n- ARISE? R and S absent? No.\n\n- AWAKE? We saw issue? And has A at 3? Not allowed.\n\n- AWARE? W, R? R absent? No.\n\n- AZURE? Z, U, R? U and R absent? No.\n\nSo what words are possible?\n\n- ABIDE? B, I, D? But I absent? From ""agile"" I(x)? So no.\n\n- ABODE? B, O, D? O? Avoids absent letters? B, O, D are not in absent list? So ABODE: A B O D E? Positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:D, 5:E? This seems possible? Because B, O, D are available.\n\n- ADOBE? A D O B E? But D, O, B? Same as above? But ADOBE: A D O B E? Positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:O, 4:B, 5:E? Also possible.\n\n- AFOOT? Not ending with E? No.\n\n- AGLET? G and L absent? No.\n\n- ALOUD? L and U absent? No.\n\n- AMONG? M, O, N? N absent? No.\n\n- AMPLE? M, P, L? L absent? No.\n\n- ANIME? N, I? Both absent? No.\n\n- APHID? P, H, I? I absent? No.\n\n- APPLE? L absent? No.\n\n- ARBOR? R absent? No.\n\n- ASIDE? S and I absent? No.\n\n- ATONE? T and N absent? No.\n\n- AWAIT? W, A, I? I absent? And no E? Not ending E? No.\n\n- AWAKE? Invalid.\n\n- AWARE? R absent? No.\n\n- AXIOM? X, I, O? I absent? No.\n\n- AZOIC? Z, O, I? I absent? No.\n\nSo possible words: ABODE and ADOBE? And perhaps others?\n\nABODE: A B O D E\n\nADOBE: A D O B E\n\nAlso, maybe ACODE? Not a word? Or AFOUL? No E? \n\nAnother: AMOVE? Not common? \n\nBAKED? But B is not at start? We need A at start? \n\nSo ABODE and ADOBE are candidates? \n\nAlso, maybe AHOLE? But offensive? Not ideal? \n\nOr ABORE? But R absent? \n\nWhat about ""ABOVE""? A B O V E? Positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:V, 5:E? V is available? Not in absent list? So ABOVE? \n\nSimilarly, ""ADORE""? But R absent? No. \n\n""AFIRE""? F, I, R? I and R absent? No. \n\n""AGONE""? G and N absent? No. \n\n""ALONE""? L and N absent? No. \n\n""AMORE""? M, O, R? R absent? No. \n\n""ANISE""? N and S absent? No. \n\n""APACE""? P, A, C? C absent? And A at 3? Not allowed? \n\n""AROSE""? R and S absent? No. \n\n""ATONE""? T and N absent? No. \n\n""AWAKE? Invalid. \n\nSo ABOVE: A B O V E? With V? \n\nAlso, ""ABYSS""? No E? \n\n""ACOLD""? C and L absent? No. \n\nSo possible words: ABODE, ADOBE, ABOVE? \n\nABODE: A B O D E \n\nADOBE: A D O B E \n\nABOVE: A B O V E \n\nAll seem valid? \n\nNow, we need to choose one? But we don\'t have more information? So we can pick one? \n\nBut we can also think of other words? Like ""AMOKE""? Not common? \n\n""JAPAN""? Not ending E? \n\nSo among ABODE, ADOBE, ABOVE? \n\nABODE and ADOBE have O and B and D? But in different positions? \n\nABOVE has B, O, V? \n\nV is less common? So perhaps ABODE or ADOBE? \n\nBut we need to guess? \n\nSince we have no information about positions 2,3,4? We can choose one arbitrarily? \n\nBut let\'s see if we can get more information? \n\nWe have to guess a word that uses new letters? \n\nBut we have many available? \n\nPerhaps we can choose a word that tests multiple common letters? \n\nBut B, O, D are common? \n\nIn ABODE, we have B at position 2, O at 3, D at 4? \n\nIn ADOBE, D at 2, O at 3, B at 4? \n\nIn ABOVE, B at 2, O at 3, V at 4? \n\nV is less common? So perhaps ABODE or ADOBE? \n\nI\'ll go with ""abode""? \n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get? \n\nWe know A and E are fixed? So we are testing the middle three? \n\nIf we guess ABODE: \n\n- Position 2: B? Could be x, ✓, or -? \n\n- Position 3: O? \n\n- Position 4: D? \n\nSimilarly for others? \n\nBut we have no prior? So we need to pick one? \n\nPerhaps we can consider that in the word, there might be no repeated letters? But we don\'t know? \n\nAnother word: ""ADMIRE""? But M, I, R? I and R absent? No. \n\n""ADORE""? R absent? No. \n\nSo I think ABODE is a good guess? \n\nBut let\'s check if it conflicts? \n\nFor example, if we guess ABODE, and the word is ADOBE? Then we get: \n\n- A: ✓ \n\n- B: at position 2? But in ADOBE, position 2 is D? So B would be x? Or if B is in the word? But ADOBE has B at position 4? So B would be present but wrong position? Minus? \n\nSimilarly, O: at position 3? In ADOBE, O at position 3? So ✓? \n\nD: at position 4? In ADOBE, position 4 is B? So D would be? In ADOBE, D is at position 2? So if we put D at position 4, it might be minus? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nSimilarly, E: ✓ \n\nSo feedback: A(✓) B(-) O(✓) D(-) E(✓) ? \n\nBut we can use that? \n\nBut we are guessing to find the word? \n\nSince we have few options? We can guess ABODE? \n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word that uses more common letters? \n\nAnother possibility: ""ABIDE"" but I absent? Not. \n\n""ABOVE"" is another? \n\nBut I think ABODE is fine. \n\nPerhaps ""AMPLE"" but L absent? No. \n\nSo I choose ""abode"". \n\nBut let\'s confirm the available letters? \n\nAbsent: C, R, N, S, U, T, G, I, L \n\nSo for ABODE: A, B, O, D, E? B, O, D are not in absent? So valid. \n\nSimilarly, ADOBE: A, D, O, B, E? Same letters? \n\nABOVE: A, B, O, V, E? V not absent? \n\nSo all possible? \n\nBut to decide, I\'ll go with ABODE. \n\nSo guess: ABODE\n\nBut we can also think of ""MAYBE""? Not starting with A? \n\nSo <guess>abode</guess> \n\nBut let\'s see if there is a better word? \n\nAnother word: ""AWOKE""? A W O K E? But O and K? And W? But K is available? But ""awoke"" has O at position 3? And E at 5? But positions: 1:A, 2:W, 3:O, 4:K, 5:E? \n\nBut we have to avoid? W and K are available? Not absent? \n\nBut in the first guess, if the word is AWOKE, then ""crane"": C R A N E? A at position 3? In AWOKE, position 3 is O? Not A? So A is present but not at position 3? Which matches the minus? \n\nAnd E at 5? Check? \n\nIn ""saute"": S A U T E? S, U, T absent? In AWOKE, no S,U,T? So x? A at position 2? But in AWOKE, position 2 is W? Not A? So A is present (at position 1) but not at 2? So minus? Correct? \n\nIn ""agile"": A G I L E? A at position 1? In AWOKE, position 1 is A? So ✓? G,I,L absent? So x? E ✓? Correct? \n\nSo AWOKE is also a possibility? \n\nSimilarly, we have more words? \n\nAWOKE: A W O K E? \n\nAnd ABODE: A B O D E? \n\nADOBE: A D O B E? \n\nABOVE: A B O V E? \n\nAnd perhaps others? \n\nBut AWOKE uses W and K? Which are less common? So perhaps ABODE is better? \n\nI think we should go with ABODE. \n\nSo final decision: guess ""abode""### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\nLet\'s synthesize the feedback from all guesses to determine the constraints for the next guess:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)  \n  - E is in the word and **correctly placed at position 5**.  \n  - A is in the word but **not in position 3**.  \n  - C, R, N are **absent** from the word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: saute** → Feedback: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)  \n  - E is **confirmed at position 5** (consistent with Guess 1).  \n  - A is in the word but **not in position 2**.  \n  - S, U, T are **absent**.  \n\n- **Guess 3: agile** → Feedback: A(✓) G(x) I(x) L(x) E(✓)  \n  - A is **correctly placed at position 1** (new information!).  \n  - E is **confirmed at position 5**.  \n  - G, I, L are **absent**.  \n\n### Key Deductions:\n1. **Confirmed positions**:  \n   - Position 1: **A** (from Guess 3).  \n   - Position 5: **E** (consistent across all guesses).  \n   - Thus, the word must start with **A** and end with **E**: `A _ _ _ E`.  \n\n2. **Absent letters**:  \n   - All guesses combined rule out: **C, R, N, S, U, T, G, I, L**.  \n   - These letters cannot appear anywhere in the word.  \n\n3. **A\'s position resolved**:  \n   - A is fixed at position 1 (from Guess 3), so the earlier feedback about A (from Guess 1 and 2) is consistent: it was misplaced because it was guessed in positions 2 and 3, but it belongs at position 1.  \n\n4. **Remaining letters**:  \n   - The middle positions (2, 3, 4) must be filled with letters **not** in the absent list.  \n   - Available letters: **B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  \n   - The word must be a valid English word.  \n\n5. **No other known letters**:  \n   - Feedback from all guesses shows only A and E are present (no other ""✓"" or ""-"" symbols for other letters), so positions 2, 3, and 4 are unknown and must be filled from the available letters.  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- We need to test plausible words of the form `A _ _ _ E` using available letters.  \n- Prioritize common letters (e.g., B, D, O, P, M) to maximize information gain.  \n- Avoid repeating letters (no evidence of duplicates, so assume distinct letters for efficiency).  \n- Possible candidate words:  \n  - **ABODE** (A, B, O, D, E)  \n  - **ADOBE** (A, D, O, B, E)  \n  - **ABOVE** (A, B, O, V, E)  \n  - **AWAKE** (invalid: A at position 3 conflicts with Guess 1 feedback)  \n  - **ALIKE** (invalid: I and L absent)  \n- **Why choose ABODE?**  \n  - Tests common letters: B (position 2), O (position 3), D (position 4).  \n  - Avoids rare letters (e.g., V in ABOVE, which is less common).  \n  - If incorrect, feedback will reveal which of B, O, or D are present/absent and their positions, narrowing down possibilities (e.g., ADOBE or ABOVE).  \n\n### Next Guess: ABODE\nThis guess adheres to all constraints and efficiently tests high-frequency letters in the middle positions.\n\n<guess>abode</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: saute -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: agile -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) G(x) I(x) L(x) E(✓)\nGuess 4: abode -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(✓) O(✓) D(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from four guesses:

1. **crane**: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
   - E is in the word and in the correct position (5).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - C, R, N are not in the word.

2. **saute**: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
   - E is correct (position 5).
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S, U, T are not in the word.

3. **agile**: A(✓) G(x) I(x) L(x) E(✓)
   - A is correct at position 1.
   - E is correct at position 5.
   - G, I, L are not in the word.

4. **abode**: A(✓) B(✓) O(✓) D(x) E(✓)
   - A, B, O, E are correct and in their positions (1, 2, 3, 5).
   - D is not in the word.

From the latest feedback (abode), we have:
- A at position 1: ✓
- B at position 2: ✓
- O at position 3: ✓
- D at position 4: x (not in the word)
- E at position 5: ✓

So the secret word is of the form: A B O _ E

We know the first three letters are A, B, O and the last is E. The fourth letter is missing and must be determined.

Also, from previous feedback, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, N, S, U, T, G, I, L, and now D is also absent.

Therefore, the absent letters are: C, R, N, S, U, T, G, I, L, D.

The fourth letter must be a letter not in the absent list and not A, B, O, E (since positions are fixed and we don't know about duplicates, but we can assume no duplicates for now?).

But note: the word might have duplicate letters? However, in the feedback so far, we have no indication of duplicates. For example, in ""abode"", D was absent, so no duplicate issue? But we don't know.

The available letters for the fourth position are from the English alphabet excluding:
- Absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T, G, I, L, D
- And the known present letters: A, B, O, E (but A, B, O, E are already placed? So the fourth letter must be a new letter? Or could it be one of them? But A, B, O are at positions 1,2,3 and E at 5? So position 4 could be a duplicate? But let's see.

However, in the feedback for ""abode"", D was marked absent, meaning that D is not in the word at all. So no duplicate of D? Similarly, other absent letters are not present.

But for the letters A, B, O, E, they are already in the word? So if the fourth letter were A, for example, that would be a duplicate? But we don't have evidence against duplicates? But let's see if it's possible.

But in the feedback, when we guessed ""crane"", we had A at position 3? And we got a minus? But if the word had A at position 4? Then in ""crane"", A at position 3 would be a minus? But we don't know about position 4? Similarly, in ""saute"", A at position 2 was minus? But if A were at position 4, that would be consistent? But in ""agile"", we have A at position 1? And we got a check? So if there were a duplicate A at position 4, it would not be reflected? Because we only have one A in ""agile""? So it might be possible? But we have no information about duplicates? 

However, in the feedback for ""abode"", we have A, B, O, E correct? And D absent? So if the word had a duplicate, say, of B at position 4? Then in ""abode"", we have B at position 2? And if position 4 is also B? Then the feedback for position 4 would be? We put D? So D is absent? But the B at position 4? We didn't test? So we don't know? 

But to be safe, we should consider that the fourth letter is a new letter? Not A, B, O, E? Because if it were one of them, it would be a duplicate? And we have no evidence for duplicates? But it's possible? 

However, let's list the possible letters for position 4.

Available letters: all letters except:
- Absent: C, R, N, S, U, T, G, I, L, D
- And the placed letters: A, B, O, E? But we don't exclude them? Because duplicates are possible? But let's see common words.

The word is A B O ? E

Common English words:
- ABODE: but we guessed it and D is absent? So not.
- ABOVE: A B O V E? V is not absent? So possible.
- ABORE: but R is absent? No.
- ABOLE? Not common? 
- ABUSE: S and U absent? No.
- ABATE: T absent? No.
- ABIDE: I and D absent? No.

So ABOVE is a strong candidate? A B O V E.

Also, ABOZE? Not a word.

ABOTE? Not.

So ABOVE seems the most common.

What about ""ABOUT""? But ends with T? Not E? No.

""ABOVE"" is the only common word? 

Another? ""ABHOR""? But H? And ends with R? R absent? And not E? No.

So likely ""above"".

But we need to confirm? 

In the feedback, if the word is ABOVE, then:

- For ""abode"": 
  - A: position 1: same? ✓
  - B: position 2: same? ✓
  - O: position 3: same? ✓
  - D: in ""abode"" at position 4? But in ABOVE, position 4 is V? So D is not present? So x? Correct.
  - E: position 5: same? ✓

Also, for previous guesses:
- ""crane"": 
  - C: absent? x
  - R: absent? x (in ABOVE, no R? So x? But ABOVE has no R? So correct? But R is absent? Yes)
  - A: at position 3? In ABOVE, position 3 is O? Not A? So A is present (at position 1) but not at 3? So minus? Correct.
  - N: absent? x
  - E: at position 5? ✓

- ""saute"":
  - S: absent? x
  - A: at position 2? In ABOVE, position 2 is B? Not A? So A present but not at 2? Minus? Correct.
  - U: absent? x
  - T: absent? x
  - E: at position 5? ✓

- ""agile"":
  - A: at position 1? ✓
  - G: absent? x
  - I: absent? x
  - L: absent? x
  - E: at position 5? ✓

All consistent? 

Therefore, the secret word is likely ""above"".

But we have to guess? We can guess ""above"" to confirm? 

Since we have only one position to fill? And we know the other four? 

So the word is A B O ? E, and the only common word is ""above""? 

But are there others? 

For example, ""ABOLE""? Not common? 

""ABYME""? Not common? 

""ABUKE""? Not? 

So ""above"" is the only common English word that fits? 

Therefore, we guess ""above"". 

But let's make sure about the absent letters? 

In ""above"", we have V? V is not in the absent list? So it's possible? 

And it fits all feedback? 

So we can guess ""above"". 

But we have one guess left? We have used 4 guesses? We have 6 tries? So we can guess? 

But we are confident? 

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests V? But we don't need? Because we know the pattern? 

So I think ""above"" is the answer? 

But the feedback for ""abode"" showed D(x)? So D is absent? And in ""above"", there is no D? So consistent? 

Therefore, we guess ""above"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the latest feedback for **Guess 4: abode** → `A(✓) B(✓) O(✓) D(x) E(✓)`, we can deduce:
- **A, B, O, E** are **correctly placed** at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5.  
- **D is absent** from the word.  
- The secret word is now **A B O _ E**, with only position 4 unknown.  

### Key Constraints:
1. **Position 4** must be filled with a letter that:  
   - Is **not** in the absent list: **C, R, N, S, U, T, G, I, L, D** (from all feedback).  
   - Forms a valid English word.  
   - Avoids duplicates (no evidence of repeated letters so far).  

2. **Possible letters for position 4**:  
   - Available: **F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z** (since A, B, O, E are already placed).  
   - Common options: **V** (e.g., ABOVE), **M** (e.g., ABOME❌—not a word), **P** (e.g., ABOPE❌—not a word), **K** (e.g., ABOKE❌—not a word).  

3. **Only valid word**:  
   - **ABOVE** (A-B-O-V-E) is the **only common English word** fitting `A B O _ E` with the constraints.  
     - V is available (not absent).  
     - Confirmed by cross-checking all feedback (e.g., no conflicts with past guesses).  

### Next Guess: ABOVE
This guess resolves the unknown position 4 with the only feasible letter (V) and completes the word.  

<guess>above</guess>",above,"We have feedback from four guesses:

1. **crane**: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
   - E is in the word and in the correct position (5).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - C, R, N are not in the word.

2. **saute**: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
   - E is correct (position 5).
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S, U, T are not in the word.

3. **agile**: A(✓) G(x) I(x) L(x) E(✓)
   - A is correct at position 1.
   - E is correct at position 5.
   - G, I, L are not in the word.

4. **abode**: A(✓) B(✓) O(✓) D(x) E(✓)
   - A, B, O, E are correct and in their positions (1, 2, 3, 5).
   - D is not in the word.

From the latest feedback (abode), we have:
- A at position 1: ✓
- B at position 2: ✓
- O at position 3: ✓
- D at position 4: x (not in the word)
- E at position 5: ✓

So the secret word is of the form: A B O _ E

We know the first three letters are A, B, O and the last is E. The fourth letter is missing and must be determined.

Also, from previous feedback, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, N, S, U, T, G, I, L, and now D is also absent.

Therefore, the absent letters are: C, R, N, S, U, T, G, I, L, D.

The fourth letter must be a letter not in the absent list and not A, B, O, E (since positions are fixed and we don't know about duplicates, but we can assume no duplicates for now?).

But note: the word might have duplicate letters? However, in the feedback so far, we have no indication of duplicates. For example, in ""abode"", D was absent, so no duplicate issue? But we don't know.

The available letters for the fourth position are from the English alphabet excluding:
- Absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T, G, I, L, D
- And the known present letters: A, B, O, E (but A, B, O, E are already placed? So the fourth letter must be a new letter? Or could it be one of them? But A, B, O are at positions 1,2,3 and E at 5? So position 4 could be a duplicate? But let's see.

However, in the feedback for ""abode"", D was marked absent, meaning that D is not in the word at all. So no duplicate of D? Similarly, other absent letters are not present.

But for the letters A, B, O, E, they are already in the word? So if the fourth letter were A, for example, that would be a duplicate? But we don't have evidence against duplicates? But let's see if it's possible.

But in the feedback, when we guessed ""crane"", we had A at position 3? And we got a minus? But if the word had A at position 4? Then in ""crane"", A at position 3 would be a minus? But we don't know about position 4? Similarly, in ""saute"", A at position 2 was minus? But if A were at position 4, that would be consistent? But in ""agile"", we have A at position 1? And we got a check? So if there were a duplicate A at position 4, it would not be reflected? Because we only have one A in ""agile""? So it might be possible? But we have no information about duplicates? 

However, in the feedback for ""abode"", we have A, B, O, E correct? And D absent? So if the word had a duplicate, say, of B at position 4? Then in ""abode"", we have B at position 2? And if position 4 is also B? Then the feedback for position 4 would be? We put D? So D is absent? But the B at position 4? We didn't test? So we don't know? 

But to be safe, we should consider that the fourth letter is a new letter? Not A, B, O, E? Because if it were one of them, it would be a duplicate? And we have no evidence for duplicates? But it's possible? 

However, let's list the possible letters for position 4.

Available letters: all letters except:
- Absent: C, R, N, S, U, T, G, I, L, D
- And the placed letters: A, B, O, E? But we don't exclude them? Because duplicates are possible? But let's see common words.

The word is A B O ? E

Common English words:
- ABODE: but we guessed it and D is absent? So not.
- ABOVE: A B O V E? V is not absent? So possible.
- ABORE: but R is absent? No.
- ABOLE? Not common? 
- ABUSE: S and U absent? No.
- ABATE: T absent? No.
- ABIDE: I and D absent? No.

So ABOVE is a strong candidate? A B O V E.

Also, ABOZE? Not a word.

ABOTE? Not.

So ABOVE seems the most common.

What about ""ABOUT""? But ends with T? Not E? No.

""ABOVE"" is the only common word? 

Another? ""ABHOR""? But H? And ends with R? R absent? And not E? No.

So likely ""above"".

But we need to confirm? 

In the feedback, if the word is ABOVE, then:

- For ""abode"": 
  - A: position 1: same? ✓
  - B: position 2: same? ✓
  - O: position 3: same? ✓
  - D: in ""abode"" at position 4? But in ABOVE, position 4 is V? So D is not present? So x? Correct.
  - E: position 5: same? ✓

Also, for previous guesses:
- ""crane"": 
  - C: absent? x
  - R: absent? x (in ABOVE, no R? So x? But ABOVE has no R? So correct? But R is absent? Yes)
  - A: at position 3? In ABOVE, position 3 is O? Not A? So A is present (at position 1) but not at 3? So minus? Correct.
  - N: absent? x
  - E: at position 5? ✓

- ""saute"":
  - S: absent? x
  - A: at position 2? In ABOVE, position 2 is B? Not A? So A present but not at 2? Minus? Correct.
  - U: absent? x
  - T: absent? x
  - E: at position 5? ✓

- ""agile"":
  - A: at position 1? ✓
  - G: absent? x
  - I: absent? x
  - L: absent? x
  - E: at position 5? ✓

All consistent? 

Therefore, the secret word is likely ""above"".

But we have to guess? We can guess ""above"" to confirm?

""ABYME""? Not common? 

""ABUKE""? Not? 

So ""above"" is the only common English word that fits? 

Therefore, we guess ""above"". 

But let's make sure about the absent letters? 

In ""above"", we have V? V is not in the absent list? So it's possible? 

And it fits all feedback? 

So we can guess ""above"". 

But we have one guess left? We have used 4 guesses? We have 6 tries? So we can guess?
