We are starting the game and need to make the first guess. Since there is no prior feedback, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we get. 
 Often, words with common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants are good for the first guess.
 A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. However, note that we have a constraint: we are playing ""Wordle"" and we know that the word is in English.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is another common starter. But let me think: we need a word that covers a variety of common letters.

 However, note that our goal is to get as much information as possible about the secret word.

 Let me recall: we want to use letters that are frequent in 5-letter words. The frequencies in English might help.

 But since we are not given any prior feedback, we can choose any valid 5-letter word.

 Some suggestions: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""SALET"", ""REAST"", etc.

 After reviewing, I choose ""CRANE"" for the following reasons:
 It has two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N). The letters are common.

 However, note that ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E. These are all fairly common.

 Let's go with ""CRANE"".

 Important: The game requires the word to be a valid English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Therefore, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

 We will output the guess accordingly.
</think>
For the first guess, I aim to cover a range of common letters, including vowels and consonants, to maximize the feedback information. I've chosen ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains three common consonants (C, R, N) and two different vowels (A, E).
- All letters are fairly high-frequency in English 5-letter words.
- The structure (CVCVC) provides balanced positional coverage.

This word will help reveal:
- Whether any of the letters C, R, A, N, or E exist in the secret word.
- The positions of matched letters via ✓/- indicators.

We are given the first guess: crane
 Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is in the word but in the wrong position (so somewhere not the first letter)
 - R is NOT in the word
 - A is in the word and in the correct position (so the third letter of the secret word is A)
 - N is NOT in the word
 - E is NOT in the word

 Therefore, we know:
 - The third letter is A (position fixed).
 - The secret word has the letter C, but not in the first position. Since the third position is A, C must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (or possibly position 1? no, because in our guess C was in position 1 and it's marked as wrong position, so C is not in position 1, and the word has C in some other position).
 - The letters R, N, E are completely absent.

 Also note: since A is fixed at position 3, we have: _ _ A _ _

 We can also deduce that the word does not contain R, N, E.

 Now, for the next guess:
 We need to choose a word that:
 1. Has A as the third letter (to confirm or get more information).
 2. Includes C in a position that is not the first (so in position 2, 4, or 5) and also avoids the now-known absent letters R, N, E.
 3. Uses new letters to test as many new positions as possible.

 However, note: we must avoid R, N, E.

 We have a placeholder: _ _ A _ _

 Since C must be present, we can try putting C in one of the possible positions (say position 2, then 4, then 5) to test.

 Approach:
 Since we know the third letter is A, we can use that as a fixed point.

 Let me brainstorm words that fit the pattern _ _ A _ _ and include C but not R, N, E.

 Also, note: we have not used any other vowels? The word must have no E? So we might consider other vowels (I, O, U) or consonants.

 We also want to test other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

 Since we have only one letter fixed and one present (C) and three absent, we need to introduce new letters.

 Possible letters: we can try using other high-frequency letters that are not yet tested, such as S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

 We must avoid R, N, E.

 So, the next guess could have:
 Position 1: a new letter (not R, N, E, and not C because we want to test C in other positions? Actually we can have C in position 1? No, because the feedback told us that C is not in position 1. So position 1 must be a new letter and cannot be C.

 Therefore, for position 1: try a new letter (say S, T, etc.)
 Position 2: we could put C? But note: if we put C in position 2, that would test whether C is in position 2. Alternatively, we can put another letter and then put C in position 4 or 5.

 However, note: if we don't put C in this guess, then we don't learn about C's position. Since the feedback told us C is present, we might want to test it in one of the possible positions to pin down.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has C in a different position and also includes other new letters.

 Considering the above, let's aim to test C in position 4 and introduce new letters for the other positions.

 Pattern: _ _ A C _   ... but wait, we don't know if C is in the fourth position. Or we can try a word that has C in position 2? But note: we were told C is not in position 1 and now if we put it in position 2, we might get feedback on position 2.

 However, we have more positions to test.

 Another idea: use a word that doesn't put C in the same position as before and tests new positions.

 Remember: we must avoid R, N, E.

 Let's list some words that contain A in the third position and C at any position except first (and the others must be letters not R, N, E) and must include C somewhere.

 Example words:
 - scab? -> s c a b -> positions: s? but we don't want C in position 2? Actually, we can try. But note we already have A as third: scab would be s, c, a, b -> but the third letter is a? Actually: s (1), c (2), a (3) -> no, because third must be a. So scab: positions: 1: s, 2: c, 3: a, ... a is in position 3? Actually: scab: 1.s, 2.c, 3.a, 4.b -> so that matches.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess said C is in the word but not in position 1. Now, if we put C in position 2, what feedback would we get? If the secret word has C in position 2, then it would be ✓ for C? Actually no: the symbol would be ✓ if correct, - if present but wrong position, x if absent.

 Alternatively, we want to test multiple things: therefore, we can put C in position 4.

 So pattern: _ _ A _ _ and include C in position 4? Then we have: _ _ A C _

 Words that match: 
 - What are words ending in C? Not necessarily: we are putting C in the fourth position.

 Example: place -> but wait: place has E? and we know E is absent. So we cannot use place.

 Also, we avoid E. So we need words that have no R, N, E.

 Let me try to think of words: 
 - with third letter A and fourth letter C: 
 Examples: 
   * hack: h a c k -> but third letter must be A: h (1), a (2), c (3) -> no, because then A is second? So pattern must be: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]

 Specifically, we need: [letter1][letter2]A[letter4][letter5]

 And we want to put C in position 4? Then: [letter1][letter2]A C [letter5]

 And the word must contain C (which it does) and avoid R, N, E.

 So what are words that fit [letter1][letter2]A C [letter5]? 
 Examples: black -> b l a c k -> but k is the last letter? Actually: black: b (1), l (2), a (3), c (4), k (5) -> yes. And it doesn't have R,N,E.

 But note: we already tried ""crane"" and we know that R and N are absent. So B, L, A, C, K: 
 - B, L, K are new? 
 - Also, we are testing if C is in position 4.

 Alternatively, we can try ""track"": t r a c k -> but we know R is absent (from first feedback) so we cannot use R -> in ""track"", R is in the second position -> so we cannot use R. So track is invalid.

 What about ""stack"": s t a c k -> no R,N,E? Yes. S, T, A, C, K -> good.

 Let me check: stack: S (1), T (2), A (3), C (4), K (5). Pattern matches.

 But wait: we have to make sure that we are not reusing absent letters: R, N, E are absent: stack uses none of these. Also, A is at the right position.

 However, note: the word must have the letter C? Yes, we are putting C at position 4, and we know C is present from the first feedback? Actually, the feedback said C is present? But we are not sure: wait, the feedback was C(-) meaning C is present but not in position 1. So stack has C at position 4.

 Let's list possible words: 
   - black: uses B, L, C, K -> avoid R,N,E -> valid.
   - stack: uses S, T, C, K -> valid.
   - quack: Q, U, A, C, K -> valid? quack is a word -> but Q is rare? Maybe not optimal? We want common words.

 But stack is quite common.

 What if we don't want to lock C at position 4? We could also try a word that puts C in a different position (position 2 or 5). For example, position 5: so _ _ A _ C

 But then: words? For example: lilac: L, I, L, A, C -> wait: third letter should be A -> positions: l(1), i(2), l(3) -> l at 3? no. Or manac? Not a word. Or pacas? Not common.

 Alternatively, we could put C in position 2: so _ C A _ _

 We can try: scab? But scab: s (1), c (2), a (3), b (4) -> but we need 5 letters: scab is 4 letters? No, scab is 4 letters. So we need a 5-letter word? Yes.

 5-letter words with pattern: [letter1] C A [letter4] [letter5]

 Examples: scamp? S C A M P -> but then we have M and P. But we have to avoid E? And also R,N? That's fine.

 However, note: in the first guess, N is absent -> so scamp: letters S, C, A, M, P -> none are R,N,E -> valid.

 Alternatively, we might consider:

 After weighing, I think testing C in position 2 or 4 is good. Let me compare:

 Option 1: Guess ""stack"": tests S, T at positions 1 and 2, and C at position 4, and K at position 5. Also, we have A at position 3.

 Option 2: Guess ""scamp"": tests S at 1, C at 2 (which was never tested and we know C must be present, so testing position 2).

 Why choose one over the other?

 We know that C cannot be in position 1, so testing position 2 for C is a good idea because if it is correct, we fix it. If not, then we know it must be in position 4 or 5.

 Given we don't have much information, scamp might be better because we test C at a new position (2) and also introduce more letters: S, M, P.

 But note: scamp: positions 1:S, 2:C, 3:A, 4:M, 5:P.

 In scamp, we are putting C at position 2. If the feedback shows that C is not in position 2 (i.e., gets '-' meaning present elsewhere or 'x' meaning ... wait, but we know C is present so it cannot be 'x'), then we learn that C is not at position 2 -> then left with position 4 or 5. Similarly, if it is ✓ then we know C is at 2.

 However, we can also test two possible C positions? Not simultaneously.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses C but also introduces common letters to get more feedback.

 Let me think: we can choose a word that doesn't have C in the same position as the first guess? The first guess had C at position 1. Now we are considering position 2 or 4.

 But note: we have only two possibilities: either position 2, 4, or 5? Actually, since we know it's not 1, and we haven't tested others.

 Another word: slack? But slack: S, L, A, C, K -> same as stack but L instead of T. We haven't tested L.

 But we don't know which is better.

 After consideration, I choose ""scamp"" because:
 - It tests C at position 2 (new position) and that might be critical.
 - It introduces new common letters: S, M, P.

 So scamp: S C A M P.

 However, we must check that all letters are valid and avoid the absent letters: yes, no R, N, E.

 Another common word? ""Scalp"": but Scalp has S, C, A, L, P -> but L is tested? We haven't tested L? So that's fine. But we don't know which letters are more common? 

 But note: in terms of letter frequency, S and L are both common.

 Let me compare:
   scamp: M and P
   scalp: L and P

 M and L are similarly common? M is slightly less than L in English.

 But maybe scamp is acceptable.

 Another point: we already got A at 3, so scamp/scalp are both valid.

 Alternatively, considering we haven't tested vowels: we know E is absent, so I and O? But we don't know if they are present? We can test a word with I and O? For example, ""sodic""? But we have third letter fixed as A? So not.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""scamp"".

 But wait: what if the secret word is ""scamp""? Then we win? But we don't know.

 However, we are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, consider: ""cabal"" but C is at the beginning? And we cannot put C at position 1? So cabal: C at 1 -> we already know it cannot be at 1? So that word is invalid because we know C is not at position 1? Actually, we can still use it? But we will get feedback that C is present but not in position 1? And we already know that. So it's wasteful? Because we are repeating the same position? Better to avoid.

 Therefore, our next guess: scamp.

 But note: we must ensure that we are using a word that does not repeat the mistake? Specifically, we want to avoid C in position 1? So any guess with C in position 1 would not be optimal? So we avoid that.

 So I think ""scamp"" is a good second guess.

 However, let me check the dictionary: scamp is a valid word.

 Output: scamp

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess told us that A is at position 3? And we are using A at position 3? So that is good.

 Therefore, let's go with ""scamp"".
</think>
### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

1. **Analyze Feedback from First Guess (CRANE):**
   - **C**: Present but wrong position (-). Since C was in position 1, it cannot be in position 1 in the secret word. Possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.
   - **R**: Absent (x). Excluded from consideration.
   - **A**: Correct position (✓). The third letter must be **A**. 
   - **N**: Absent (x). Excluded from consideration.
   - **E**: Absent (x). Excluded from consideration.
   
2. **Key Deductions:**
   - Secret word structure: _ _ A _ _ 
   - The word contains **C** (in position 2, 4, or 5) but **NOT** in position 1.
   - Excluded letters: **R, N, E**. Avoid using these in future guesses.

3. **Strategy for Second Guess:**
   - **Must honor fixed A in position 3**.
   - **Test C in a new position**: Since position 1 and position 3 are ruled out for C, focus on testing C in position 2, 4, or 5 to gather positional clues. Prioritizing position 2 (untested) maximizes information gain.
   - **Use new high-frequency letters**: Introduce consonants like **S**, **M**, **P**, **L**, **T**, and vowels like **O**, **U**, or **I** (since E is excluded).
   - **Avoid excluded letters (R, N, E)** and ensure the guess is a valid 5-letter word.

4. **Brainstorm Candidate Words:**
   - **SCAMP** fits the structure: S C A M P
   - Why SCAMP? 
     - **S**: New letter (common, tests position 1)
     - **C**: Position 2 (tests if C is here, which is a plausible new slot)
     - **A**: Locked in position 3 (confirms pattern)
     - **M** and **P**: New letters (common consonants)
   - Avoids R, N, E entirely.
   - Anomalies addressed: C is tested in uncharted position 2, potentially pinning it down early.

5. **Optimization & Trade-offs**:
   - Alternative words like ""STACK"" (C in position 4) or ""BLACK"" (C in position 4) are valid. However, testing **position 2 first** provides clearer insight for C—if misplaced, C must be in 4 or 5. This optimizes deduction paths.
   - ""SCAMP"" covers diverse letters (S, M, P), increasing odds of useful feedback.

 - C is in the word but in the wrong position (so somewhere not the first letter)
 - R is NOT in the word
 - A is in the word and in the correct position (so the third letter of the secret word is A)
 - N is NOT in the word

 Since we know the third letter is A, we can use that as a fixed point.

 Let me brainstorm words that fit the pattern _ _ A _ _ and include C but not R, N, E.

 Also, note: we have not used any other vowels? The word must have no E? So we might consider other vowels (I, O, U) or consonants.

 We also want to test other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

 Since we have only one letter fixed and one present (C) and three absent, we need to introduce new letters.

 Possible letters: we can try using other high-frequency letters that are not yet tested, such as S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

 We must avoid R, N, E.

 So, the next guess could have:
 Position 1: a new letter (not R, N, E, and not C because we want to test C in other positions? Actually we can have C in position 1? No, because the feedback told us that C is not in position 1. So position 1 must be a new letter and cannot be C.

 Therefore, for position 1: try a new letter (say S, T, etc.)
 Position 2: we could put C? But note: if we put C in position 2, that would test whether C is in position 2. Alternatively, we can put another letter and then put C in position 4 or 5.

 However, note: if we don't put C in this guess, then we don't learn about C's position. Since the feedback told us C is present, we might want to test it in one of the possible positions to pin down.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has C in a different position and also includes other new letters.

 Considering the above, let's aim to test C in position 4 and introduce new letters for the other positions.

 Pattern: _ _ A C _   ... but wait, we don't know if C is in the fourth position. Or we can try a word that has C in position 2? But note: we were told C is not in position 1 and now if we put it in position 2, we might get feedback on position 2.

 However, we have more positions to test.

 Another idea: use a word that doesn't put C in the same position as before and tests new positions.

 Remember: we must avoid R, N, E.

 Let's list some words that contain A in the third position and C at any position except first (and the others must be letters not R, N, E) and must include C somewhere.

 Example words:
 - scab? -> s c a b -> positions: s? but we don't want C in position 2? Actually, we can try. But note we already have A as third: scab would be s, c, a, b -> but the third letter is a? Actually: s (1), c (2), a (3) -> no, because third must be a. So scab: positions: 1: s, 2: c, 3: a, ... a is in position 3? Actually: scab: 1.s, 2.c, 3.a, 4.b -> so that matches.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess said C is in the word but not in position 1. Now, if we put C in position 2, what feedback would we get? If the secret word has C in position 2, then it would be ✓ for C? Actually no: the symbol would be ✓ if correct, - if present but wrong position, x if absent.

 Alternatively, we want to test multiple things: therefore, we can put C in position 4.

 So pattern: _ _ A _ _ and include C in position 4? Then we have: _ _ A C _

 Words that match: 
 - What are words ending in C? Not necessarily: we are putting C in the fourth position.

 Example: place -> but wait: place has E? and we know E is absent. So we cannot use place.

 Also, we avoid E. So we need words that have no R, N, E.

 Let me try to think of words: 
 - with third letter A and fourth letter C: 
 Examples: 
   * hack: h a c k -> but third letter must be A: h (1), a (2), c (3) -> no, because then A is second? So pattern must be: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]

 Specifically, we need: [letter1][letter2]A[letter4][letter5]

 And we want to put C in position 4? Then: [letter1][letter2]A C [letter5]

 And the word must contain C (which it does) and avoid R, N, E.

 So what are words that fit [letter1][letter2]A C [letter5]? 
 Examples: black -> b l a c k -> but k is the last letter? Actually: black: b (1), l (2), a (3), c (4), k (5) -> yes. And it doesn't have R,N,E.

 But note: we already tried ""crane"" and we know that R and N are absent. So B, L, A, C, K: 
 - B, L, K are new? 
 - Also, we are testing if C is in position 4.

 Alternatively, we can try ""track"": t r a c k -> but we know R is absent (from first feedback) so we cannot use R -> in ""track"", R is in the second position -> so we cannot use R. So track is invalid.

 What about ""stack"": s t a c k -> no R,N,E? Yes. S, T, A, C, K -> good.

 Let me check: stack: S (1), T (2), A (3), C (4), K (5). Pattern matches.

 But wait: we have to make sure that we are not reusing absent letters: R, N, E are absent: stack uses none of these. Also, A is at the right position.

 However, note: the word must have the letter C? Yes, we are putting C at position 4, and we know C is present from the first feedback? Actually, the feedback said C is present? But we are not sure: wait, the feedback was C(-) meaning C is present but not in position 1. So stack has C at position 4.

 Let's list possible words: 
   - black: uses B, L, C, K -> avoid R,N,E -> valid.
   - stack: uses S, T, C, K -> valid.
   - quack: Q, U, A, C, K -> valid? quack is a word -> but Q is rare? Maybe not optimal? We want common words.

 But stack is quite common.

 What if we don't want to lock C at position 4? We could also try a word that puts C in a different position (position 2 or 5). For example, position 5: so _ _ A _ C

 But then: words? For example: lilac: L, I, L, A, C -> wait: third letter should be A -> positions: l(1), i(2), l(3) -> l at 3? no. Or manac? Not a word. Or pacas? Not common.

 Alternatively, we could put C in position 2: so _ C A _ _

 We can try: scab? But scab: s (1), c (2), a (3), b (4) -> but we need 5 letters: scab is 4 letters? No, scab is 4 letters. So we need a 5-letter word? Yes.

 5-letter words with pattern: [letter1] C A [letter4] [letter5]

 Examples: scamp? S C A M P -> but then we have M and P. But we have to avoid E? And also R,N? That's fine.

 However, note: in the first guess, N is absent -> so scamp: letters S, C, A, M, P -> none are R,N,E -> valid.

 Alternatively, we might consider:

 After weighing, I think testing C in position 2 or 4 is good. Let me compare:

 Option 1: Guess ""stack"": tests S, T at positions 1 and 2, and C at position 4, and K at position 5. Also, we have A at position 3.

 Option 2: Guess ""scamp"": tests S at 1, C at 2 (which was never tested and we know C must be present, so testing position 2).

 Why choose one over the other?

 We know that C cannot be in position 1, so testing position 2 for C is a good idea because if it is correct, we fix it. If not, then we know it must be in position 4 or 5.

 Given we don't have much information, scamp might be better because we test C at a new position (2) and also introduce more letters: S, M, P.

 But note: scamp: positions 1:S, 2:C, 3:A, 4:M, 5:P.

 In scamp, we are putting C at position 2. If the feedback shows that C is not in position 2 (i.e., gets '-' meaning present elsewhere or 'x' meaning ... wait, but we know C is present so it cannot be 'x'), then we learn that C is not at position 2 -> then left with position 4 or 5. Similarly, if it is ✓ then we know C is at 2.

 However, we can also test two possible C positions? Not simultaneously.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses C but also introduces common letters to get more feedback.

 Let me think: we can choose a word that doesn't have C in the same position as the first guess? The first guess had C at position 1. Now we are considering position 2 or 4.

 But note: we have only two possibilities: either position 2, 4, or 5? Actually, since we know it's not 1, and we haven't tested others.

 Another word: slack? But slack: S, L, A, C, K -> same as stack but L instead of T. We haven't tested L.

 But we don't know which is better.

 After consideration, I choose ""scamp"" because:
 - It tests C at position 2 (new position) and that might be critical.
 - It introduces new common letters: S, M, P.

 So scamp: S C A M P.

 However, we must check that all letters are valid and avoid the absent letters: yes, no R, N, E.

 Another common word? ""Scalp"": but Scalp has S, C, A, L, P -> but L is tested? We haven't tested L? So that's fine. But we don't know which letters are more common? 

 But note: in terms of letter frequency, S and L are both common.

 Let me compare:
   scamp: M and P
   scalp: L and P

 M and L are similarly common? M is slightly less than L in English.

 But maybe scamp is acceptable.

 Another point: we already got A at 3, so scamp/scalp are both valid.

 Alternatively, considering we haven't tested vowels: we know E is absent, so I and O? But we don't know if they are present? We can test a word with I and O? For example, ""sodic""? But we have third letter fixed as A? So not.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""scamp"".

 But wait: what if the secret word is ""scamp""? Then we win? But we don't know.

 However, we are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, consider: ""cabal"" but C is at the beginning? And we cannot put C at position 1? So cabal: C at 1 -> we already know it cannot be at 1? So that word is invalid because we know C is not at position 1? Actually, we can still use it? But we will get feedback that C is present but not in position 1? And we already know that. So it's wasteful? Because we are repeating the same position? Better to avoid.

 Therefore, our next guess: scamp.

 But note: we must ensure that we are using a word that does not repeat the mistake? Specifically, we want to avoid C in position 1? So any guess with C in position 1 would not be optimal? So we avoid that.

 So I think ""scamp"" is a good second guess.

 However, let me check the dictionary: scamp is a valid word.

 Output: scamp

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess told us that A is at position 3? And we are using A at position 3? So that is good.

 Therefore, let's go with ""scamp"".### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

1. **Analyze Feedback from First Guess (CRANE):**
   - **C**: Present but wrong position (-). Since C was in position 1, it cannot be in position 1 in the secret word. Possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.
   - **R**: Absent (x). Excluded from consideration.
   - **A**: Correct position (✓). The third letter must be **A**. 
   - **N**: Absent (x). Excluded from consideration.
   - **E**: Absent (x). Excluded from consideration.
   
2. **Key Deductions:**
   - Secret word structure: _ _ A _ _ 
   - The word contains **C** (in position 2, 4, or 5) but **NOT** in position 1.
   - Excluded letters: **R, N, E**. Avoid using these in future guesses.

3. **Strategy for Second Guess:**
   - **Must honor fixed A in position 3**.
   - **Test C in a new position**: Since position 1 and position 3 are ruled out for C, focus on testing C in position 2, 4, or 5 to gather positional clues. Prioritizing position 2 (untested) maximizes information gain.
   - **Use new high-frequency letters**: Introduce consonants like **S**, **M**, **P**, **L**, **T**, and vowels like **O**, **U**, or **I** (since E is excluded).
   - **Avoid excluded letters (R, N, E)** and ensure the guess is a valid 5-letter word.

4. **Brainstorm Candidate Words:**
   - **SCAMP** fits the structure: S C A M P
   - Why SCAMP? 
     - **S**: New letter (common, tests position 1)
     - **C**: Position 2 (tests if C is here, which is a plausible new slot)
     - **A**: Locked in position 3 (confirms pattern)
     - **M** and **P**: New letters (common consonants)
   - Avoids R, N, E entirely.
   - Anomalies addressed: C is tested in uncharted position 2, potentially pinning it down early.

5. **Optimization & Trade-offs**:
   - Alternative words like ""STACK"" (C in position 4) or ""BLACK"" (C in position 4) are valid. However, testing **position 2 first** provides clearer insight for C—if misplaced, C must be in 4 or 5. This optimizes deduction paths.
   - ""SCAMP"" covers diverse letters (S, M, P), increasing odds of useful feedback.",Guess 2: scamp -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(-) A(✓) M(-) P(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,smack,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game and need to make the first guess. Since there is no prior feedback, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we get. 
 Often, words with common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants are good for the first guess.
 A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. However, note that we have a constraint: we are playing ""Wordle"" and we know that the word is in English.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is another common starter. But let me think: we need a word that covers a variety of common letters.

 However, note that our goal is to get as much information as possible about the secret word.

 Let me recall: we want to use letters that are frequent in 5-letter words. The frequencies in English might help.

 But since we are not given any prior feedback, we can choose any valid 5-letter word.

 Some suggestions: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""SALET"", ""REAST"", etc.

 After reviewing, I choose ""CRANE"" for the following reasons:
 It has two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N). The letters are common.

 However, note that ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E. These are all fairly common.

 Let's go with ""CRANE"".

 Important: The game requires the word to be a valid English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Therefore, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

 We will output the guess accordingly.For the first guess, I aim to cover a range of common letters, including vowels and consonants, to maximize the feedback information. I've chosen ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains three common consonants (C, R, N) and two different vowels (A, E).
- All letters are fairly high-frequency in English 5-letter words.
- The structure (CVCVC) provides balanced positional coverage.

This word will help reveal:
- Whether any of the letters C, R, A, N, or E exist in the secret word.
- The positions of matched letters via ✓/- indicators.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the first guess: crane
 Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is in the word but in the wrong position (so somewhere not the first letter)
 - R is NOT in the word
 - A is in the word and in the correct position (so the third letter of the secret word is A)
 - N is NOT in the word
 - E is NOT in the word

 Therefore, we know:
 - The third letter is A (position fixed).
 - The secret word has the letter C, but not in the first position. Since the third position is A, C must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (or possibly position 1? no, because in our guess C was in position 1 and it's marked as wrong position, so C is not in position 1, and the word has C in some other position).
 - The letters R, N, E are completely absent.

 Also note: since A is fixed at position 3, we have: _ _ A _ _

 We can also deduce that the word does not contain R, N, E.

 Now, for the next guess:
 We need to choose a word that:
 1. Has A as the third letter (to confirm or get more information).
 2. Includes C in a position that is not the first (so in position 2, 4, or 5) and also avoids the now-known absent letters R, N, E.
 3. Uses new letters to test as many new positions as possible.

 However, note: we must avoid R, N, E.

 We have a placeholder: _ _ A _ _

 Since C must be present, we can try putting C in one of the possible positions (say position 2, then 4, then 5) to test.

 Approach:
 Since we know the third letter is A, we can use that as a fixed point.

 Let me brainstorm words that fit the pattern _ _ A _ _ and include C but not R, N, E.

 Also, note: we have not used any other vowels? The word must have no E? So we might consider other vowels (I, O, U) or consonants.

 We also want to test other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

 Since we have only one letter fixed and one present (C) and three absent, we need to introduce new letters.

 Possible letters: we can try using other high-frequency letters that are not yet tested, such as S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

 We must avoid R, N, E.

 So, the next guess could have:
 Position 1: a new letter (not R, N, E, and not C because we want to test C in other positions? Actually we can have C in position 1? No, because the feedback told us that C is not in position 1. So position 1 must be a new letter and cannot be C.

 Therefore, for position 1: try a new letter (say S, T, etc.)
 Position 2: we could put C? But note: if we put C in position 2, that would test whether C is in position 2. Alternatively, we can put another letter and then put C in position 4 or 5.

 However, note: if we don't put C in this guess, then we don't learn about C's position. Since the feedback told us C is present, we might want to test it in one of the possible positions to pin down.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has C in a different position and also includes other new letters.

 Considering the above, let's aim to test C in position 4 and introduce new letters for the other positions.

 Pattern: _ _ A C _   ... but wait, we don't know if C is in the fourth position. Or we can try a word that has C in position 2? But note: we were told C is not in position 1 and now if we put it in position 2, we might get feedback on position 2.

 However, we have more positions to test.

 Another idea: use a word that doesn't put C in the same position as before and tests new positions.

 Remember: we must avoid R, N, E.

 Let's list some words that contain A in the third position and C at any position except first (and the others must be letters not R, N, E) and must include C somewhere.

 Example words:
 - scab? -> s c a b -> positions: s? but we don't want C in position 2? Actually, we can try. But note we already have A as third: scab would be s, c, a, b -> but the third letter is a? Actually: s (1), c (2), a (3) -> no, because third must be a. So scab: positions: 1: s, 2: c, 3: a, ... a is in position 3? Actually: scab: 1.s, 2.c, 3.a, 4.b -> so that matches.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess said C is in the word but not in position 1. Now, if we put C in position 2, what feedback would we get? If the secret word has C in position 2, then it would be ✓ for C? Actually no: the symbol would be ✓ if correct, - if present but wrong position, x if absent.

 Alternatively, we want to test multiple things: therefore, we can put C in position 4.

 So pattern: _ _ A _ _ and include C in position 4? Then we have: _ _ A C _

 Words that match: 
 - What are words ending in C? Not necessarily: we are putting C in the fourth position.

 Example: place -> but wait: place has E? and we know E is absent. So we cannot use place.

 Also, we avoid E. So we need words that have no R, N, E.

 Let me try to think of words: 
 - with third letter A and fourth letter C: 
 Examples: 
   * hack: h a c k -> but third letter must be A: h (1), a (2), c (3) -> no, because then A is second? So pattern must be: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]

 Specifically, we need: [letter1][letter2]A[letter4][letter5]

 And we want to put C in position 4? Then: [letter1][letter2]A C [letter5]

 And the word must contain C (which it does) and avoid R, N, E.

 So what are words that fit [letter1][letter2]A C [letter5]? 
 Examples: black -> b l a c k -> but k is the last letter? Actually: black: b (1), l (2), a (3), c (4), k (5) -> yes. And it doesn't have R,N,E.

 But note: we already tried ""crane"" and we know that R and N are absent. So B, L, A, C, K: 
 - B, L, K are new? 
 - Also, we are testing if C is in position 4.

 Alternatively, we can try ""track"": t r a c k -> but we know R is absent (from first feedback) so we cannot use R -> in ""track"", R is in the second position -> so we cannot use R. So track is invalid.

 What about ""stack"": s t a c k -> no R,N,E? Yes. S, T, A, C, K -> good.

 Let me check: stack: S (1), T (2), A (3), C (4), K (5). Pattern matches.

 But wait: we have to make sure that we are not reusing absent letters: R, N, E are absent: stack uses none of these. Also, A is at the right position.

 However, note: the word must have the letter C? Yes, we are putting C at position 4, and we know C is present from the first feedback? Actually, the feedback said C is present? But we are not sure: wait, the feedback was C(-) meaning C is present but not in position 1. So stack has C at position 4.

 Let's list possible words: 
   - black: uses B, L, C, K -> avoid R,N,E -> valid.
   - stack: uses S, T, C, K -> valid.
   - quack: Q, U, A, C, K -> valid? quack is a word -> but Q is rare? Maybe not optimal? We want common words.

 But stack is quite common.

 What if we don't want to lock C at position 4? We could also try a word that puts C in a different position (position 2 or 5). For example, position 5: so _ _ A _ C

 But then: words? For example: lilac: L, I, L, A, C -> wait: third letter should be A -> positions: l(1), i(2), l(3) -> l at 3? no. Or manac? Not a word. Or pacas? Not common.

 Alternatively, we could put C in position 2: so _ C A _ _

 We can try: scab? But scab: s (1), c (2), a (3), b (4) -> but we need 5 letters: scab is 4 letters? No, scab is 4 letters. So we need a 5-letter word? Yes.

 5-letter words with pattern: [letter1] C A [letter4] [letter5]

 Examples: scamp? S C A M P -> but then we have M and P. But we have to avoid E? And also R,N? That's fine.

 However, note: in the first guess, N is absent -> so scamp: letters S, C, A, M, P -> none are R,N,E -> valid.

 Alternatively, we might consider:

 After weighing, I think testing C in position 2 or 4 is good. Let me compare:

 Option 1: Guess ""stack"": tests S, T at positions 1 and 2, and C at position 4, and K at position 5. Also, we have A at position 3.

 Option 2: Guess ""scamp"": tests S at 1, C at 2 (which was never tested and we know C must be present, so testing position 2).

 Why choose one over the other?

 We know that C cannot be in position 1, so testing position 2 for C is a good idea because if it is correct, we fix it. If not, then we know it must be in position 4 or 5.

 Given we don't have much information, scamp might be better because we test C at a new position (2) and also introduce more letters: S, M, P.

 But note: scamp: positions 1:S, 2:C, 3:A, 4:M, 5:P.

 In scamp, we are putting C at position 2. If the feedback shows that C is not in position 2 (i.e., gets '-' meaning present elsewhere or 'x' meaning ... wait, but we know C is present so it cannot be 'x'), then we learn that C is not at position 2 -> then left with position 4 or 5. Similarly, if it is ✓ then we know C is at 2.

 However, we can also test two possible C positions? Not simultaneously.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses C but also introduces common letters to get more feedback.

 Let me think: we can choose a word that doesn't have C in the same position as the first guess? The first guess had C at position 1. Now we are considering position 2 or 4.

 But note: we have only two possibilities: either position 2, 4, or 5? Actually, since we know it's not 1, and we haven't tested others.

 Another word: slack? But slack: S, L, A, C, K -> same as stack but L instead of T. We haven't tested L.

 But we don't know which is better.

 After consideration, I choose ""scamp"" because:
 - It tests C at position 2 (new position) and that might be critical.
 - It introduces new common letters: S, M, P.

 So scamp: S C A M P.

 However, we must check that all letters are valid and avoid the absent letters: yes, no R, N, E.

 Another common word? ""Scalp"": but Scalp has S, C, A, L, P -> but L is tested? We haven't tested L? So that's fine. But we don't know which letters are more common? 

 But note: in terms of letter frequency, S and L are both common.

 Let me compare:
   scamp: M and P
   scalp: L and P

 M and L are similarly common? M is slightly less than L in English.

 But maybe scamp is acceptable.

 Another point: we already got A at 3, so scamp/scalp are both valid.

 Alternatively, considering we haven't tested vowels: we know E is absent, so I and O? But we don't know if they are present? We can test a word with I and O? For example, ""sodic""? But we have third letter fixed as A? So not.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""scamp"".

 But wait: what if the secret word is ""scamp""? Then we win? But we don't know.

 However, we are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, consider: ""cabal"" but C is at the beginning? And we cannot put C at position 1? So cabal: C at 1 -> we already know it cannot be at 1? So that word is invalid because we know C is not at position 1? Actually, we can still use it? But we will get feedback that C is present but not in position 1? And we already know that. So it's wasteful? Because we are repeating the same position? Better to avoid.

 Therefore, our next guess: scamp.

 But note: we must ensure that we are using a word that does not repeat the mistake? Specifically, we want to avoid C in position 1? So any guess with C in position 1 would not be optimal? So we avoid that.

 So I think ""scamp"" is a good second guess.

 However, let me check the dictionary: scamp is a valid word.

 Output: scamp

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess told us that A is at position 3? And we are using A at position 3? So that is good.

 Therefore, let's go with ""scamp"".### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

1. **Analyze Feedback from First Guess (CRANE):**
   - **C**: Present but wrong position (-). Since C was in position 1, it cannot be in position 1 in the secret word. Possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.
   - **R**: Absent (x). Excluded from consideration.
   - **A**: Correct position (✓). The third letter must be **A**. 
   - **N**: Absent (x). Excluded from consideration.
   - **E**: Absent (x). Excluded from consideration.
   
2. **Key Deductions:**
   - Secret word structure: _ _ A _ _ 
   - The word contains **C** (in position 2, 4, or 5) but **NOT** in position 1.
   - Excluded letters: **R, N, E**. Avoid using these in future guesses.

3. **Strategy for Second Guess:**
   - **Must honor fixed A in position 3**.
   - **Test C in a new position**: Since position 1 and position 3 are ruled out for C, focus on testing C in position 2, 4, or 5 to gather positional clues. Prioritizing position 2 (untested) maximizes information gain.
   - **Use new high-frequency letters**: Introduce consonants like **S**, **M**, **P**, **L**, **T**, and vowels like **O**, **U**, or **I** (since E is excluded).
   - **Avoid excluded letters (R, N, E)** and ensure the guess is a valid 5-letter word.

4. **Brainstorm Candidate Words:**
   - **SCAMP** fits the structure: S C A M P
   - Why SCAMP? 
     - **S**: New letter (common, tests position 1)
     - **C**: Position 2 (tests if C is here, which is a plausible new slot)
     - **A**: Locked in position 3 (confirms pattern)
     - **M** and **P**: New letters (common consonants)
   - Avoids R, N, E entirely.
   - Anomalies addressed: C is tested in uncharted position 2, potentially pinning it down early.

5. **Optimization & Trade-offs**:
   - Alternative words like ""STACK"" (C in position 4) or ""BLACK"" (C in position 4) are valid. However, testing **position 2 first** provides clearer insight for C—if misplaced, C must be in 4 or 5. This optimizes deduction paths.
   - ""SCAMP"" covers diverse letters (S, M, P), increasing odds of useful feedback.

Since there is no prior feedback, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we get. \n Often, words with common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants are good for the first guess.\n A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. However, note that we have a constraint: we are playing ""Wordle"" and we know that the word is in English.\n\n Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is another common starter. But let me think: we need a word that covers a variety of common letters.\n\n However, note that our goal is to get as much information as possible about the secret word.\n\n Let me recall: we want to use letters that are frequent in 5-letter words. The frequencies in English might help.\n\n But since we are not given any prior feedback, we can choose any valid 5-letter word.\n\n Some suggestions: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""SALET"", ""REAST"", etc.\n\n After reviewing, I choose ""CRANE"" for the following reasons:\n It has two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N). The letters are common.\n\n However, note that ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E. These are all fairly common.\n\n Let\'s go with ""CRANE"".\n\n Important: The game requires the word to be a valid English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.\n\n Therefore, our first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n We will output the guess accordingly.For the first guess, I aim to cover a range of common letters, including vowels and consonants, to maximize the feedback information. I\'ve chosen ""CRANE"" because:\n- It contains three common consonants (C, R, N) and two different vowels (A, E).\n- All letters are fairly high-frequency in English 5-letter words.\n- The structure (CVCVC) provides balanced positional coverage.\n\nThis word will help reveal:\n- Whether any of the letters C, R, A, N, or E exist in the secret word.\n- The positions of matched letters via ✓/- indicators.\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given the first guess: crane\n Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\n\n Interpretation:\n - C is in the word but in the wrong position (so somewhere not the first letter)\n - R is NOT in the word\n - A is in the word and in the correct position (so the third letter of the secret word is A)\n - N is NOT in the word\n - E is NOT in the word\n\n Therefore, we know:\n - The third letter is A (position fixed).\n - The secret word has the letter C, but not in the first position. Since the third position is A, C must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (or possibly position 1? no, because in our guess C was in position 1 and it\'s marked as wrong position, so C is not in position 1, and the word has C in some other position).\n - The letters R, N, E are completely absent.\n\n Also note: since A is fixed at position 3, we have: _ _ A _ _\n\n We can also deduce that the word does not contain R, N, E.\n\n Now, for the next guess:\n We need to choose a word that:\n 1.

Includes C in a position that is not the first (so in position 2, 4, or 5) and also avoids the now-known absent letters R, N, E.\n 3. Uses new letters to test as many new positions as possible.\n\n However, note: we must avoid R, N, E.\n\n We have a placeholder: _ _ A _ _\n\n Since C must be present, we can try putting C in one of the possible positions (say position 2, then 4, then 5) to test.\n\n Approach:\n Since we know the third letter is A, we can use that as a fixed point.\n\n Let me brainstorm words that fit the pattern _ _ A _ _ and include C but not R, N, E.\n\n Also, note: we have not used any other vowels? The word must have no E? So we might consider other vowels (I, O, U) or consonants.\n\n We also want to test other common letters to narrow down possibilities.\n\n Since we have only one letter fixed and one present (C) and three absent, we need to introduce new letters.\n\n Possible letters: we can try using other high-frequency letters that are not yet tested, such as S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.\n\n We must avoid R, N, E.\n\n So, the next guess could have:\n Position 1: a new letter (not R, N, E, and not C because we want to test C in other positions? Actually we can have C in position 1? No, because the feedback told us that C is not in position 1. So position 1 must be a new letter and cannot be C.\n\n Therefore, for position 1: try a new letter (say S, T, etc.)\n Position 2: we could put C? But note: if we put C in position 2, that would test whether C is in position 2. Alternatively, we can put another letter and then put C in position 4 or 5.\n\n However, note: if we don\'t put C in this guess, then we don\'t learn about C\'s position. Since the feedback told us C is present, we might want to test it in one of the possible positions to pin down.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a word that has C in a different position and also includes other new letters.\n\n Considering the above, let\'s aim to test C in position 4 and introduce new letters for the other positions.\n\n Pattern: _ _ A C _   ... but wait, we don\'t know if C is in the fourth position. Or we can try a word that has C in position 2? But note: we were told C is not in position 1 and now if we put it in position 2, we might get feedback on position 2.\n\n However, we have more positions to test.\n\n Another idea: use a word that doesn\'t put C in the same position as before and tests new positions.\n\n Remember: we must avoid R, N, E.\n\n Let\'s list some words that contain A in the third position and C at any position except first (and the others must be letters not R, N, E) and must include C somewhere.\n\n Example words:\n - scab? -> s c a b -> positions: s? but we don\'t want C in position 2? Actually, we can try. But note we already have A as third: scab would be s, c, a, b -> but the third letter is a? Actually: s (1), c (2), a (3) -> no, because third must be a. So scab: positions: 1: s, 2: c, 3: a, ... a is in position 3? Actually: scab: 1.s, 2.c, 3.a, 4.b -> so that matches.\n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess said C is in the word but not in position 1. Now, if we put C in position 2, what feedback would we get? If the secret word has C in position 2, then it would be ✓ for C? Actually no: the symbol would be ✓ if correct, - if present but wrong position, x if absent.\n\n Alternatively, we want to test multiple things: therefore, we can put C in position 4.\n\n So pattern: _ _ A _ _ and include C in position 4? Then we have: _ _ A C _\n\n Words that match: \n - What are words ending in C? Not necessarily: we are putting C in the fourth position.\n\n Example: place -> but wait: place has E? and we know E is absent. So we cannot use place.\n\n Also, we avoid E. So we need words that have no R, N, E.\n\n Let me try to think of words: \n - with third letter A and fourth letter C: \n Examples: \n   * hack: h a c k -> but third letter must be A: h (1), a (2), c (3) -> no, because then A is second? So pattern must be: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]\n\n Specifically, we need: [letter1][letter2]A[letter4][letter5]\n\n And we want to put C in position 4? Then: [letter1][letter2]A C [letter5]\n\n And the word must contain C (which it does) and avoid R, N, E.\n\n So what are words that fit [letter1][letter2]A C [letter5]? \n Examples: black -> b l a c k -> but k is the last letter? Actually: black: b (1), l (2), a (3), c (4), k (5) -> yes. And it doesn\'t have R,N,E.\n\n But note: we already tried ""crane"" and we know that R and N are absent. So B, L, A, C, K: \n - B, L, K are new? \n - Also, we are testing if C is in position 4.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""track"": t r a c k -> but we know R is absent (from first feedback) so we cannot use R -> in ""track"", R is in the second position -> so we cannot use R. So track is invalid.\n\n What about ""stack"": s t a c k -> no R,N,E? Yes. S, T, A, C, K -> good.\n\n Let me check: stack: S (1), T (2), A (3), C (4), K (5). Pattern matches.\n\n But wait: we have to make sure that we are not reusing absent letters: R, N, E are absent: stack uses none of these. Also, A is at the right position.\n\n However, note: the word must have the letter C? Yes, we are putting C at position 4, and we know C is present from the first feedback? Actually, the feedback said C is present? But we are not sure: wait, the feedback was C(-) meaning C is present but not in position 1. So stack has C at position 4.\n\n Let\'s list possible words: \n   - black: uses B, L, C, K -> avoid R,N,E -> valid.\n   - stack: uses S, T, C, K -> valid.\n   - quack: Q, U, A, C, K -> valid? quack is a word -> but Q is rare? Maybe not optimal? We want common words.\n\n But stack is quite common.\n\n What if we don\'t want to lock C at position 4? We could also try a word that puts C in a different position (position 2 or 5). For example, position 5: so _ _ A _ C\n\n But then: words? For example: lilac: L, I, L, A, C -> wait: third letter should be A -> positions: l(1), i(2), l(3) -> l at 3? no. Or manac? Not a word. Or pacas? Not common.\n\n Alternatively, we could put C in position 2: so _ C A _ _\n\n We can try: scab? But scab: s (1), c (2), a (3), b (4) -> but we need 5 letters: scab is 4 letters? No, scab is 4 letters. So we need a 5-letter word? Yes.\n\n 5-letter words with pattern: [letter1] C A [letter4] [letter5]\n\n Examples: scamp? S C A M P -> but then we have M and P. But we have to avoid E? And also R,N? That\'s fine.\n\n However, note: in the first guess, N is absent -> so scamp: letters S, C, A, M, P -> none are R,N,E -> valid.\n\n Alternatively, we might consider:\n\n After weighing, I think testing C in position 2 or 4 is good. Let me compare:\n\n Option 1: Guess ""stack"": tests S, T at positions 1 and 2, and C at position 4, and K at position 5. Also, we have A at position 3.\n\n Option 2: Guess ""scamp"": tests S at 1, C at 2 (which was never tested and we know C must be present, so testing position 2).\n\n Why choose one over the other?\n\n We know that C cannot be in position 1, so testing position 2 for C is a good idea because if it is correct, we fix it. If not, then we know it must be in position 4 or 5.\n\n Given we don\'t have much information, scamp might be better because we test C at a new position (2) and also introduce more letters: S, M, P.\n\n But note: scamp: positions 1:S, 2:C, 3:A, 4:M, 5:P.\n\n In scamp, we are putting C at position 2. If the feedback shows that C is not in position 2 (i.e., gets \'-\' meaning present elsewhere or \'x\' meaning ... wait, but we know C is present so it cannot be \'x\'), then we learn that C is not at position 2 -> then left with position 4 or 5. Similarly, if it is ✓ then we know C is at 2.\n\n However, we can also test two possible C positions? Not simultaneously.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses C but also introduces common letters to get more feedback.\n\n Let me think: we can choose a word that doesn\'t have C in the same position as the first guess? The first guess had C at position 1. Now we are considering position 2 or 4.\n\n But note: we have only two possibilities: either position 2, 4, or 5? Actually, since we know it\'s not 1, and we haven\'t tested others.\n\n Another word: slack? But slack: S, L, A, C, K -> same as stack but L instead of T. We haven\'t tested L.\n\n But we don\'t know which is better.\n\n After consideration, I choose ""scamp"" because:\n - It tests C at position 2 (new position) and that might be critical.\n - It introduces new common letters: S, M, P.\n\n So scamp: S C A M P.\n\n However, we must check that all letters are valid and avoid the absent letters: yes, no R, N, E.\n\n Another common word? ""Scalp"": but Scalp has S, C, A, L, P -> but L is tested? We haven\'t tested L? So that\'s fine. But we don\'t know which letters are more common? \n\n But note: in terms of letter frequency, S and L are both common.\n\n Let me compare:\n   scamp: M and P\n   scalp: L and P\n\n M and L are similarly common? M is slightly less than L in English.\n\n But maybe scamp is acceptable.\n\n Another point: we already got A at 3, so scamp/scalp are both valid.\n\n Alternatively, considering we haven\'t tested vowels: we know E is absent, so I and O? But we don\'t know if they are present? We can test a word with I and O? For example, ""sodic""? But we have third letter fixed as A? So not.\n\n Therefore, I\'ll go with ""scamp"".\n\n But wait: what if the secret word is ""scamp""? Then we win? But we don\'t know.\n\n However, we are trying to get information.\n\n Alternatively, consider: ""cabal"" but C is at the beginning? And we cannot put C at position 1? So cabal: C at 1 -> we already know it cannot be at 1? So that word is invalid because we know C is not at position 1? Actually, we can still use it? But we will get feedback that C is present but not in position 1? And we already know that. So it\'s wasteful? Because we are repeating the same position? Better to avoid.\n\n Therefore, our next guess: scamp.\n\n But note: we must ensure that we are using a word that does not repeat the mistake? Specifically, we want to avoid C in position 1? So any guess with C in position 1 would not be optimal? So we avoid that.\n\n So I think ""scamp"" is a good second guess.\n\n However, let me check the dictionary: scamp is a valid word.\n\n Output: scamp\n\n But wait: the feedback for the first guess told us that A is at position 3? And we are using A at position 3? So that is good.\n\n Therefore, let\'s go with ""scamp"".### Step-by-Step Thought Process:\n\n1. **Analyze Feedback from First Guess (CRANE):**\n   - **C**: Present but wrong position (-).

We are given two previous guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
  Interpretation:
    - C is in the word but not in position 1.
    - R, N, E are absent.
    - A is correct and in position 3.

Guess 2: scamp -> Feedback: S(✓) C(-) A(✓) M(-) P(x)
  Interpretation:
    - S is correct and in position 1 (since it was guessed in position 1 and marked ✓).
    - C is in the word but not in position 2 (because it's marked - for position 2).
    - A is correct and in position 3 (already known).
    - M is in the word but not in position 4 (because marked - for position 4).
    - P is absent (x) so not in the word.

Now, we can deduce:

1. The secret word starts with S (from Guess 2: S at position 1 is ✓).
2. The secret word has A at position 3.
3. The secret word contains C and M, but:
   - C is not at position 1 or 2 (from Guess 1 and Guess 2). 
      Since the word starts with S at position 1, and position 2 is taken by something else (we don't know yet), and C was in position 2 and marked '-', meaning C is present but not at that position, so C must be in position 4 or 5 (since position 1 is S and 3 is A).
   - M is present but not at position 4 (since in scamp, M was at position 4 and marked '-').

4. P is absent, so we exclude P.
5. We also know from Guess 1 that R, N, E are absent.

Current knowns and constraints:

- Position 1: S
- Position 3: A
- The word has C: either in position 4 or 5.
- The word has M: but not in position 4 (and not in position 1 because that's S, or position 3 because that's A), so M must be in position 2 or 5 (but cannot be in position 4). 
- Letters not used: We have positions 2, 4, and 5 to assign, with two known letters: C and M, and possibly one more unknown? 
  Also note: the word must have 5 letters, and so far we know S, A, and two more: C and M. And the fifth letter is missing.

So, we know 4 letters: S, A, C, M? But wait, we also have to consider that the word must include a fifth distinct letter? Or possibly repetition? However, the rules don't necessarily forbid repetition, so we must consider that letters might repeat? But the feedback doesn't account for duplicates? In Wordle, duplicates are handled differently. However, note that in our previous guesses, we didn't use any duplicate letters, and we have no indication of duplicates yet.

Also, we know from scamp that P is absent. So the fifth letter is not P, not R, not N, not E.

Now, let me summarize the positions:

Positions:
1: S (known)
2: ? 
3: A (known)
4: ?
5: ?

And the word must contain: C and M (and we already have S and A).

Also, the absent letters: R, N, E, P.

Now, constraints:
- C must be in position 4 or 5 (not 1,2,3). 
- M must be in position 2 or 5 (because position 1 is taken, position 3 is taken, and not position 4 because it was marked '-' for position 4).

Problem: position 5 cannot have both C and M? Unless the word has duplicates? But in English words, it's possible? For example, ""scram"" but we know R is absent? Not. So we must consider: is it possible that M and C are in different positions? Then we have to assign:

Case: M at position 2: then C must be at 4 or 5? And position 5 left? Then we have:
Word: S M A ? ?

But ? for position 4 and 5: one must be C and the other is a new letter? And the word must be valid.

Similarly, if M at position 5: then position 2 must be a new letter? And then C at position 4? Because if C is at 5, then M must be at 2? But wait, we have M only at 5? Then:

Pattern possibilities:

Option 1: M in position 2 -> word: S M A ? ?
   Then positions: 
      4: could be C? Then position 5 is a new letter? 
      OR 
      5: could be C? Then position 4 is a new letter.

Option 2: M in position 5 -> word: S ? A ? M
   Then positions:
      2: new letter
      4: could be C? 
      OR
      if C is in position 5? But position 5 is M, so C cannot be there? Unless duplicate? But M and C are different? Then C would have to be at position 4? So in this option, C must be at position 4? And position 2 is a new letter? Then word: S [new] A C M.

Also, note: we have no duplicates indicated yet? But feedback may reveal duplicates? How?

Important: In Wordle, if the secret word has duplicate letters, and your guess has one of that letter, it may not show multiple indications? But in this game, the rules don't specify? However, from standard Wordle, if a letter appears twice in the word and you guess one, you get one symbol? And if you guess two copies, and only one exists, one might be marked as absent? But here, we haven't guessed duplicates? And our previous guesses didn't include duplicates? So we'll assume standard rules: duplicate letters are marked individually? 

Therefore, without indication, we must assume that the secret word may contain at most two of any letter? But without evidence, we proceed cautiously.

But for now, we have not seen feedback for duplicates? So let's assume no duplicates? Then:

In Option 2 (M at position 5): then C must be at position 4? Because it cannot be at 1,2,3 and position 5 is M? Then positions: 2 is an unknown letter? So the word: S [letter2] A C M.

Similarly, for Option 1 (M at position 2): then word: S M A ? ? 
   - Then either: position 4: C? position 5: new letter? 
   - Or: position 4: new letter? position 5: C?

We must guess a word that fits either possibility? And we must use a word that uses only letters that are not excluded: not R, N, E, P.

Which letters are available? All letters except: R, N, E, P. And also: we haven't tested many letters? So we can use? For example: (common consonants and vowels) B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to maximize information? We should try to introduce new common letters? Also, we can try to set the word to test both possibilities?

Alternatively, we can guess a word that fits Option 2? Because Option 2 has less flexibility: the structure is fixed: S ? A C M? Then we can try words that fit: S [letter] A C M? For example: ""scram"" but R is excluded? So scraM is bad? ""slim"" is 4 letters? Not. ""swarm"" has R? Excluded. ""shack"" has C but we already have at position 4? Wait: no: shack: S H A C K -> so if we replace: position 2: H, then position 4: C, position 5: K -> which matches S?ACK? Then the word is shack? But does shack have M? No. And in our Option 2, the last letter is M? So we are looking for words ending with M? So S?ACM -> which matches words like ""scram"" but R is excluded? ""sham"" is 4 letters? Not. So 5 letter words with pattern S?ACM? 

Actually: S [letter] A C M -> for example: ""scram"" -> no, because of R. ""sbeam"" not word? Maybe: ""swack""? Not a common word? Or ""smack"": but wait, smack: S M A C K -> then M is at position 2? That would be Option 1? Not Option 2.

Word list? Common words:

- ""slick""? But S L I C K -> no, third letter is I, not A? So not.
- ""stack""? We considered earlier? But S T A C K -> but in scamp, P was absent? And we know P is absent? Then stack: we are testing positions? But stack: S T A C K -> then:
   If the secret word were ""stack"", the feedback for scamp would have been different? In scamp: we had SCAMP. Feedback: S(✓) C(-) A(✓) M(-) P(x). If secret is ""stack"", then:
     S: correctly placed
     C: in stack, C is at position 4? But guessed at position 2 -> C should be marked '-' because present but wrong position -> correct? 
     A: correct
     M: stack has no M? Then it should be marked x? But our feedback said M(-) meaning M is present but not at that position? So if stack doesn't have M, it would be x? But we got '-'? So stack cannot be? Because M is present? So we know M must be in the secret word? So stack is not valid? Because stack does not have M? Therefore, stack is not the word.

Other words: we need words that have M? So not stack? So Option 2: words having M? And ending with M? So words of the form S?ACM? Such words? 

Examples: 
  ""scram"": not, because has R? and R is excluded? 
  ""scam"": not 5 letters.
  ""shoem""? not? 

Or ""steam""? But steam: S T E A M -> we know E is absent? So cannot? 

Or ""siam""? Not? 

After searching, the only common word that fits Option 2 is ""scram""? But that has R? Or ""scrodm""? Not. 

Alternatively, Option 2 might be rare? So maybe M is at position 2 (Option 1)? Then we look for words: S M A ? ? ? And then C at 4 or 5? 

Examples: S M A C K? -> smack? 
   Smack: S M A C K -> then if we guess smack? Then pattern: S M A C K -> then:
      We know S is right? 
      M: position 2? M at position 2: the feedback in scamp told us M was at position 4? But secret word has M at position 2? So when we guessed scamp: M at 4, but it is actually at 2? Then M would be marked '-' meaning present but wrong position? Which matches the feedback? Because it showed '-' not ✓? So that's consistent? 

Similarly, words like ""small"": S M A L L? But L duplicated? And L? 
   Absent letters include P? Not R,N,E,P. So L is ok? 

But we also have to put C somewhere? No: in smack we have C at position 4? And the secret word must have C? So smack: has C at 4? 

But note: the secret word must have M? We know that? Then we can try smack? 

Alternatively, words: S M A D? But not? Or S M A W T? Not common? 

Therefore, common words that fit Option 1 are: ""smack"", ""small"", ""smart"" but R excluded? 

So smack: S M A C K -> then letters: S,M,A,C,K? And K is new? 

Our second guess: scamp didn't test K? So we can use smack? 

But note: we are missing constraints? We also know that C must be present? In smack, C is at position 4? 

So smack is a valid candidate? 

But also, we can use words: S M A K E? But E is excluded? 

Or S M A T H? Not common? 

Therefore, we can use ""smack"" as a third guess? Because:
   - It tests M at position 2: if M is at position 2, then it would be ✓? 
   - And C at position 4? If C is at position 4, ✓? 

But what if the word has M not at 2? Then it might be at 5? Then smack has M at 2? Not 5? Then feedback would say M is present at the wrong position? But wait we assume M must be at 2 or 5? Smack forces the issue. 

Alternatively, to cover both possibilities? But we cannot? 

Another word? That uses M at 5? And also tests other letters? For example: S T A C M? But T? 

But note: we haven't tested T? So it might be a possibility? But that word: positions: S T A C M -> then if we guess scam? Wait: ""stacm"" is not a word? 

Valid words: S H A C M -> ""shacm"" no? 

Therefore, Option 1 seems more likely? Then the word is smack? Or small? 

But: small: S M A L L -> then L repeated? And no C? Because smack has C? So smack? 

We must have C! So if Option 1, then if we put C at position 4? Then smack: has C at 4? 

If we put C at position 5? Then S M A ? C? Example: ""smack"" is not? Or ""smock"" but E issue? Or ""smith"" no? S M I T H -> no A at 3? 

So we need words: S M A [X] C -> or S M A [letter4] C? But then 5 letters? S M A [4] C? 

But that position 5 is C? Only? So word: S M A [consonant] C? Like ""smarc"" R excluded? Or ""smarp"" P excluded? ""smamc"" not? Impossible? So practically, the only common word that fits is ""smack""? 

Therefore, let's guess ""smack"". 

But wait: what about the unknown fifth letter? In smack, we have K? Which is not tested yet? So it's a possible? 

Also, we might think: what if the word has a vowel in position 2? But M is a consonant? 

Alternatively, we could check: what if M is not at 2? Then it must be at 5? Then we need words: S [letter] A C M -> and letter must be available? 

Possible: ""steam"" not? E excluded? ""slyam""? Not? 

Or ""sciam"" not? 

Therefore, the only possibility? Is that M is at position 2? Then the word is S M A ? ? ? And C at 4? And the fifth letter? Must be a letter not excluded? So then S M A C K? or S M A L L? If S M A L L? Then we don't have C? And we know the word must have C? So that would violate the C constraint? Therefore, S M A L L would not have the C? So invalid? Hence, the word must be S M A C K? 

So guess smack? 

But wait: we also have M? And M might be duplicated? But no feedback? So we assume no duplicates? 

Therefore, we guess ""smack"". 

But note: we are not 100% sure? But it fits? 

To summarize:

- The word starts with S, has A at 3? 
- Has C? Must be at 4? Because if M is at 2, position 5 cannot have C? Unless? We already did: we thought position 5 could be C? But then in the pattern? For Option 1: S M A [letter4] C? But what words? ""S M A for C""? None? 

Actually, we considered only when C at 4? Then at position 5? we have K? 

But what if C at 5? Then S M A L C? But that's not a word? Position 5: C? Then word: S M A L C? -> ""smalc"" not? 

Therefore, only when C is at position 4? Then: S M A C [letter5]? That is a valid pattern? And the letter5 must be a letter? Such as K? L? etc? Then smack? Smack has letter5: K? Valid? 

If letter5 is T: then ""smatc"" not? 

So smack is a candidate? 

Therefore, we guess smack? 

But note: we also could guess a word that tests other letters? But we must hit the constraints? 

Alternatively, since we have an opportunity, we can test a word that has the possibility of M at position 5? And C at position 4? But what word? 

For example: ""slick"" no? Because third letter must be A? 

Or ""sackm"" not? 

After analysis, ""smack"" is the most plausible? 

So we output smack. 

But then, if we guess smack:

- If the secret word is ""smack"": we win? 

- Otherwise, feedback will tell us:

   - S? It should be ✓? 
   - M? We put at position 2? If the secret word has M at position 5? Then M would be marked '-' meaning present but wrong position? 
   - A? ✓? 
   - C? We put at position 4? If the secret word has C at position 5? Then we get '-'? 
   - K? We put at position 5? If the secret word has K? And if it is at position 5? Then ✓? Or not?

But we don't know? 

Since we are in the third guess? We can try and adjust? 

But I believe ""smack"" is the best guess? 

Therefore, we guess ""smack""? 

But note: what about other words? For example: ""smith""? But has no A? 

After reviewing, we guess smack.

### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback:**
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**:
     - C: Present (but not position 1) → Must be in position 4 or 5.
     - R: Absent.
     - A: Correct (position 3).
     - N, E: Absent.
   - **Guess 2 (scamp)**:
     - S: Correct (position 1).
     - C: Present (but not position 2) → Since position 1 is S and position 3 is A, C must be in position 4 or 5 (matches Guess 1).
     - A: Correct (position 3).
     - M: Present (but not position 4) → Since positions 1 (S) and 3 (A) are fixed, M must be in position 2 or 5.
     - P: Absent.

2. **Key Deductions:**
   - **Fixed positions**: 
     - Position 1: **S**
     - Position 3: **A**
   - **Present letters**: **C** (in 4 or 5) and **M** (in 2 or 5).
   - **Absent letters**: R, N, E, P (excluded from future guesses).
   - **Structure**: `S _ A _ _` (positions 2, 4, 5 unknown).
   - **Constraints**:
     - Position 5 cannot simultaneously hold both M and C (unless duplicates are allowed, but no evidence yet).
     - M in position 2 forces C to position 4 or 5 (with position 5 available if M is elsewhere).
     - M in position 5 forces C to position 4 (since position 5 is occupied).

3. **Test Highest-Probability Scenario**:
   - The most plausible structure places **M in position 2** (untested position) and **C in position 4** (maximizes common letter reuse).
   - **Word candidate**: **SMACK**:
     - Fits `S M A C K`:
       - Position 1: S (✓)
       - Position 2: M (tests M-in-2 hypothesis)
       - Position 3: A (✓)
       - Position 4: C (tests C-in-4 hypothesis)
       - Position 5: K (new letter, avoids absent letters R/N/E/P).
     - Introduces **K** (common consonant) to gather new information.

4. **Why SMACK?**:
   - Directly tests positions for M (priority) and C confirmation.
   - If M were in position 5 instead, feedback on M will clarify this.
   - Avoids inefficiencies:
     - Reusing excluded letters (R/N/E/P).
     - Skipping tests for high-priority slots (M at pos 2).

<guess>smack</guess>",smack,"We are given two previous guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
  Interpretation:
    - C is in the word but not in position 1.
    - R, N, E are absent.
    - A is correct and in position 3.

Guess 2: scamp -> Feedback: S(✓) C(-) A(✓) M(-) P(x)
  Interpretation:
    - S is correct and in position 1 (since it was guessed in position 1 and marked ✓).
    - C is in the word but not in position 2 (because it's marked - for position 2).
    - A is correct and in position 3 (already known).
    - M is in the word but not in position 4 (because marked - for position 4).
    - P is absent (x) so not in the word.

Now, we can deduce:

1. The secret word starts with S (from Guess 2: S at position 1 is ✓).
2. The secret word has A at position 3.
3. The secret word contains C and M, but:
   - C is not at position 1 or 2 (from Guess 1 and Guess 2). 
      Since the word starts with S at position 1, and position 2 is taken by something else (we don't know yet), and C was in position 2 and marked '-', meaning C is present but not at that position, so C must be in position 4 or 5 (since position 1 is S and 3 is A).
   - M is present but not at position 4 (since in scamp, M was at position 4 and marked '-').

4. P is absent, so we exclude P.
5. We also know from Guess 1 that R, N, E are absent.

Current knowns and constraints:

- Position 1: S
- Position 3: A
- The word has C: either in position 4 or 5.
- The word has M: but not in position 4 (and not in position 1 because that's S, or position 3 because that's A), so M must be in position 2 or 5 (but cannot be in position 4). 
- Letters not used: We have positions 2, 4, and 5 to assign, with two known letters: C and M, and possibly one more unknown? 
  Also note: the word must have 5 letters, and so far we know S, A, and two more: C and M. And the fifth letter is missing.

So, we know 4 letters: S, A, C, M? But wait, we also have to consider that the word must include a fifth distinct letter? Or possibly repetition? However, the rules don't necessarily forbid repetition, so we must consider that letters might repeat? But the feedback doesn't account for duplicates? In Wordle, duplicates are handled differently. However, note that in our previous guesses, we didn't use any duplicate letters, and we have no indication of duplicates yet.

Also, we know from scamp that P is absent. So the fifth letter is not P, not R, not N, not E.

Now, let me summarize the positions:

Positions:
1: S (known)
2: ? 
3: A (known)
4: ?
5: ?

And the word must contain: C and M (and we already have S and A).

Also, the absent letters: R, N, E, P.

Now, constraints:
- C must be in position 4 or 5 (not 1,2,3). 
- M must be in position 2 or 5 (because position 1 is taken, position 3 is taken, and not position 4 because it was marked '-' for position 4).

Problem: position 5 cannot have both C and M? Unless the word has duplicates? But in English words, it's possible? For example, ""scram"" but we know R is absent? Not. So we must consider: is it possible that M and C are in different positions? Then we have to assign:

Case: M at position 2: then C must be at 4 or 5? And position 5 left? Then we have:
Word: S M A ? ?

But ? for position 4 and 5: one must be C and the other is a new letter? And the word must be valid.

Similarly, if M at position 5: then position 2 must be a new letter? And then C at position 4? Because if C is at 5, then M must be at 2? But wait, we have M only at 5? Then:

Pattern possibilities:

Option 1: M in position 2 -> word: S M A ? ?
   Then positions: 
      4: could be C? Then position 5 is a new letter? 
      OR 
      5: could be C? Then position 4 is a new letter.

Option 2: M in position 5 -> word: S ? A ? M
   Then positions:
      2: new letter
      4: could be C? 
      OR
      if C is in position 5? But position 5 is M, so C cannot be there? Unless duplicate? But M and C are different? Then C would have to be at position 4? So in this option, C must be at position 4? And position 2 is a new letter? Then word: S [new] A C M.

Also, note: we have no duplicates indicated yet? But feedback may reveal duplicates? How?

Important: In Wordle, if the secret word has duplicate letters, and your guess has one of that letter, it may not show multiple indications? But in this game, the rules don't specify? However, from standard Wordle, if a letter appears twice in the word and you guess one, you get one symbol? And if you guess two copies, and only one exists, one might be marked as absent? But here, we haven't guessed duplicates? And our previous guesses didn't include duplicates? So we'll assume standard rules: duplicate letters are marked individually? 

Therefore, without indication, we must assume that the secret word may contain at most two of any letter? But without evidence, we proceed cautiously.

But for now, we have not seen feedback for duplicates? So let's assume no duplicates? Then:

In Option 2 (M at position 5): then C must be at position 4? Because it cannot be at 1,2,3 and position 5 is M? Then positions: 2 is an unknown letter? So the word: S [letter2] A C M.

Similarly, for Option 1 (M at position 2): then word: S M A ? ? 
   - Then either: position 4: C? position 5: new letter? 
   - Or: position 4: new letter? position 5: C?

We must guess a word that fits either possibility? And we must use a word that uses only letters that are not excluded: not R, N, E, P.

Which letters are available? All letters except: R, N, E, P. And also: we haven't tested many letters? So we can use? For example: (common consonants and vowels) B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to maximize information? We should try to introduce new common letters? Also, we can try to set the word to test both possibilities?

Alternatively, we can guess a word that fits Option 2? Because Option 2 has less flexibility: the structure is fixed: S ? A C M? Then we can try words that fit: S [letter] A C M? For example: ""scram"" but R is excluded? So scraM is bad? ""slim"" is 4 letters? Not. ""swarm"" has R? Excluded. ""shack"" has C but we already have at position 4? Wait: no: shack: S H A C K -> so if we replace: position 2: H, then position 4: C, position 5: K -> which matches S?ACK? Then the word is shack? But does shack have M? No. And in our Option 2, the last letter is M? So we are looking for words ending with M? So S?ACM -> which matches words like ""scram"" but R is excluded? ""sham"" is 4 letters? Not. So 5 letter words with pattern S?ACM? 

Actually: S [letter] A C M -> for example: ""scram"" -> no, because of R. ""sbeam"" not word? Maybe: ""swack""? Not a common word? Or ""smack"": but wait, smack: S M A C K -> then M is at position 2? That would be Option 1? Not Option 2.

Word list? Common words:

- ""slick""? But S L I C K -> no, third letter is I, not A? So not.
- ""stack""? We considered earlier? But S T A C K -> but in scamp, P was absent? And we know P is absent? Then stack: we are testing positions? But stack: S T A C K -> then:
   If the secret word were ""stack"", the feedback for scamp would have been different? In scamp: we had SCAMP. Feedback: S(✓) C(-) A(✓) M(-) P(x). If secret is ""stack"", then:
     S: correctly placed
     C: in stack, C is at position 4? But guessed at position 2 -> C should be marked '-' because present but wrong position -> correct? 
     A: correct
     M: stack has no M? Then it should be marked x? But our feedback said M(-) meaning M is present but not at that position? So if stack doesn't have M, it would be x? But we got '-'? So stack cannot be? Because M is present? So we know M must be in the secret word? So stack is not valid? Because stack does not have M? Therefore, stack is not the word.

Other words: we need words that have M? So not stack? So Option 2: words having M? And ending with M? So words of the form S?ACM? Such words? 

Examples: 
  ""scram"": not, because has R? and R is excluded? 
  ""scam"": not 5 letters.
  ""shoem""? not? 

Or ""steam""? But steam: S T E A M -> we know E is absent? So cannot? 

Or ""siam""? Not? 

After searching, the only common word that fits Option 2 is ""scram""? But that has R? Or ""scrodm""? Not. 

Alternatively, Option 2 might be rare? So maybe M is at position 2 (Option 1)? Then we look for words: S M A ? ? ? And then C at 4 or 5? 

Examples: S M A C K? -> smack? 
   Smack: S M A C K -> then if we guess smack? Then pattern: S M A C K -> then:
      We know S is right? 
      M: position 2? M at position 2: the feedback in scamp told us M was at position 4? But secret word has M at position 2? So when we guessed scamp: M at 4, but it is actually at 2? Then M would be marked '-' meaning present but wrong position? Which matches the feedback? Because it showed '-' not ✓? So that's consistent? 

Similarly, words like ""small"": S M A L L? But L duplicated? And L? 
   Absent letters include P? Not R,N,E,P. So L is ok? 

But we also have to put C somewhere? No: in smack we have C at position 4? And the secret word must have C? So smack: has C at 4? 

But note: the secret word must have M? We know that? Then we can try smack? 

Alternatively, words: S M A D? But not? Or S M A W T? Not common? 

Therefore, common words that fit Option 1 are: ""smack"", ""small"", ""smart"" but R excluded? 

So smack: S M A C K -> then letters: S,M,A,C,K? And K is new? 

Our second guess: scamp didn't test K? So we can use smack? 

But note: we are missing constraints? We also know that C must be present? In smack, C is at position 4? 

So smack is a valid candidate? 

But also, we can use words: S M A K E? But E is excluded? 

Or S M A T H? Not common? 

Therefore, we can use ""smack"" as a third guess? Because:
   - It tests M at position 2: if M is at position 2, then it would be ✓? 
   - And C at position 4? If C is at position 4, ✓? 

But what if the word has M not at 2? Then it might be at 5? Then smack has M at 2? Not 5? Then feedback would say M is present at the wrong position? But wait we assume M must be at 2 or 5? Smack forces the issue. 

Alternatively, to cover both possibilities? But we cannot? 

Another word? That uses M at 5? And also tests other letters? For example: S T A C M? But T? 

But note: we haven't tested T? So it might be a possibility? But that word: positions: S T A C M -> then if we guess scam? Wait: ""stacm"" is not a word? 

Valid words: S H A C M -> ""shacm"" no? 

Therefore, Option 1 seems more likely? Then the word is smack? Or small? 

But: small: S M A L L -> then L repeated? And no C? Because smack has C? So smack? 

We must have C! So if Option 1, then if we put C at position 4? Then smack: has C at 4? 

If we put C at position 5? Then S M A ? C? Example: ""smack"" is not? Or ""smock"" but E issue? Or ""smith"" no? S M I T H -> no A at 3? 

So we need words: S M A [X] C -> or S M A [letter4] C? But then 5 letters? S M A [4] C? 

But that position 5 is C? Only? So word: S M A [consonant] C? Like ""smarc"" R excluded? Or ""smarp"" P excluded? ""smamc"" not? Impossible? So practically, the only common word that fits is ""smack""? 

Therefore, let's guess ""smack"". 

But wait: what about the unknown fifth letter? In smack, we have K? Which is not tested yet? So it's a possible? 

Also, we might think: what if the word has a vowel in position 2? But M is a consonant? 

Alternatively, we could check: what if M is not at 2? Then it must be at 5? Then we need words: S [letter] A C M -> and letter must be available? 

Possible: ""steam"" not? E excluded? ""slyam""? Not? 

Or ""sciam"" not? 

Therefore, the only possibility? Is that M is at position 2? Then the word is S M A ? ? ? And C at 4? And the fifth letter? Must be a letter not excluded? So then S M A C K? or S M A L L? If S M A L L? Then we don't have C? And we know the word must have C? So that would violate the C constraint? Therefore, S M A L L would not have the C? So invalid? Hence, the word must be S M A C K? 

So guess smack? 

But wait: we also have M? And M might be duplicated? But no feedback? So we assume no duplicates? 

Therefore, we guess ""smack"". 

But note: we are not 100% sure? But it fits? 

To summarize:

- The word starts with S, has A at 3? 
- Has C? Must be at 4? Because if M is at 2, position 5 cannot have C? Unless? We already did: we thought position 5 could be C? But then in the pattern? For Option 1: S M A [letter4] C? But what words? ""S M A for C""? None? 

Actually, we considered only when C at 4? Then at position 5? we have K? 

But what if C at 5? Then S M A L C? But that's not a word? Position 5: C? Then word: S M A L C? -> ""smalc"" not? 

Therefore, only when C is at position 4? Then: S M A C [letter5]? That is a valid pattern? And the letter5 must be a letter? Such as K? L? etc? Then smack? Smack has letter5: K? Valid? 

If letter5 is T: then ""smatc"" not? 

So smack is a candidate? 

Therefore, we guess smack? 

But note: we also could guess a word that tests other letters? But we must hit the constraints? 

Alternatively, since we have an opportunity, we can test a word that has the possibility of M at position 5? And C at position 4? But what word? 

For example: ""slick"" no? Because third letter must be A? 

Or ""sackm"" not? 

After analysis, ""smack"" is the most plausible? 

So we output smack. 

But then, if we guess smack:

- If the secret word is ""smack"": we win? 

- Otherwise, feedback will tell us:

   - S? It should be ✓? 
   - M? We put at position 2? If the secret word has M at position 5? Then M would be marked '-' meaning present but wrong position? 
   - A? ✓? 
   - C? We put at position 4? If the secret word has C at position 5? Then we get '-'? 
   - K? We put at position 5? If the secret word has K? And if it is at position 5? Then ✓? Or not?

But we don't know? 

Since we are in the third guess? We can try and adjust? 

But I believe ""smack"" is the best guess? 

Therefore, we guess ""smack""? 

But note: what about other words? For example: ""smith""? But has no A? 

After reviewing, we guess smack.### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback:**
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**:
     - C: Present (but not position 1) → Must be in position 4 or 5.
     - R: Absent.
     - A: Correct (position 3).
     - N, E: Absent.
   - **Guess 2 (scamp)**:
     - S: Correct (position 1).
     - C: Present (but not position 2) → Since position 1 is S and position 3 is A, C must be in position 4 or 5 (matches Guess 1).
     - A: Correct (position 3).
     - M: Present (but not position 4) → Since positions 1 (S) and 3 (A) are fixed, M must be in position 2 or 5.
     - P: Absent.

2. **Key Deductions:**
   - **Fixed positions**: 
     - Position 1: **S**
     - Position 3: **A**
   - **Present letters**: **C** (in 4 or 5) and **M** (in 2 or 5).
   - **Absent letters**: R, N, E, P (excluded from future guesses).
   - **Structure**: `S _ A _ _` (positions 2, 4, 5 unknown).
   - **Constraints**:
     - Position 5 cannot simultaneously hold both M and C (unless duplicates are allowed, but no evidence yet).
     - M in position 2 forces C to position 4 or 5 (with position 5 available if M is elsewhere).
     - M in position 5 forces C to position 4 (since position 5 is occupied).

3. **Test Highest-Probability Scenario**:
   - The most plausible structure places **M in position 2** (untested position) and **C in position 4** (maximizes common letter reuse).
   - **Word candidate**: **SMACK**:
     - Fits `S M A C K`:
       - Position 1: S (✓)
       - Position 2: M (tests M-in-2 hypothesis)
       - Position 3: A (✓)
       - Position 4: C (tests C-in-4 hypothesis)
       - Position 5: K (new letter, avoids absent letters R/N/E/P).
     - Introduces **K** (common consonant) to gather new information.

4. **Why SMACK?**:
   - Directly tests positions for M (priority) and C confirmation.
   - If M were in position 5 instead, feedback on M will clarify this.
   - Avoids inefficiencies:
     - Reusing excluded letters (R/N/E/P).
     - Skipping tests for high-priority slots (M at pos 2).",Guess 3: smack -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) M(✓) A(✓) C(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
