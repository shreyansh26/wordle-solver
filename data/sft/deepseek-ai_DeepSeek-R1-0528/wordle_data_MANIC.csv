We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word that can give us good information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
 - The letters are all distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: - (meaning C is in the secret word but not in the first position)
 R: x (R is not in the secret word at all)
 A: - (A is in the secret word but not in the third position)
 N: - (N is in the secret word but not in the fourth position)
 E: x (E is not in the secret word)

 So, from this we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters C, A, and N (but not R or E).
 - The positions: 
     C is not in position 1 (but it is in the word, so it must be in one of positions 2,3,4,5)
     A is not in position 3 (so it must be in one of 1,2,4,5)
     N is not in position 4 (so it must be in one of 1,2,3,5)

 Also, note that the word does not contain R or E.

 Since we have three confirmed letters: C, A, N, and we know they are in the word but not in the positions we guessed.

 We need to make a second guess that includes these letters (C, A, N) and avoids R and E, and also tries to place them in different positions.

 Additionally, we should try to include other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of words that have C, A, N and two other letters (avoiding R and E). Also, we want to place C, A, N in positions that are different from the first guess.

 In the first guess:
   C was at position 1 -> now we know it's not at 1, so we can try it at 2,3,4,5.
   A was at position 3 -> now we know it's not at 3, so we can try at 1,2,4,5.
   N was at position 4 -> now we know it's not at 4, so we can try at 1,2,3,5.

 We also know that the word is 5 letters and we have 3 of them. We need to guess two more letters. Let's choose common consonants that are not R or E and not already in the word? But note: we don't know what other letters are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has C, A, N and two new letters to test.

 Let me try to think of words that have C, A, N and two other letters (without R and E). Also, we want to avoid repeating the positions of C, A, N as in the first guess.

 Example: 
   We can try to put A in position 1, C in position 3, and N in position 5? But we don't know if that's allowed.

 However, we must form a valid English word.

 Let me brainstorm:

 Option 1: Place A at the beginning? 
   A _ _ _ _ 
   We need to include C and N. Also, we have two more letters.

 Option 2: Place C somewhere else? 

 Since we know the word has C, A, N, and we have two more letters to discover, we can try a word that rearranges these and adds two new letters.

 Common words: 
   ""can"" is only 3 letters, so we need 5.

 How about ""clang""? 
   But note: we have feedback that in the first guess, the letter at position 1 was C (which was marked as present but wrong position). So if we put C at position 1 again, that would be the same as the first guess? But the feedback says C is in the word but not at position 1. So we must avoid putting C at position 1.

 Similarly, we must avoid putting A at position 3 and N at position 4.

 So ""clang"": 
   C at position 1 -> we must avoid because we know C is not at position 1.

 How about ""latch""? 
   L A T C H -> 
   A is at position 2 (which is allowed, because previously it was at 3 and now we avoid 3) 
   C is at position 4 (allowed, because previously it was at 1 and now we avoid 1) 
   But we also have T and H. And we don't know if T and H are in the word.

 However, we also need to include N? Because we know N is in the word. But ""latch"" does not have N. So that won't work.

 We need a word that has C, A, and N.

 How about ""cabin""? 
   C is at position 1 -> not allowed (we know C is not at position 1). 

 How about ""panic""? 
   P A N I C -> 
   P (new), A at position 2 (allowed, because previously A was at 3), N at position 3 (allowed? previously N was at 4, so position 3 is new), I (new), C at position 5 (allowed, because previously C was at 1).

 So ""panic"" has:
   P (new), A (at 2), N (at 3), I (new), C (at 5).

 This word uses the letters: P, A, N, I, C.

 We know the secret word has C, A, N. So we are including them and testing two new letters: P and I.

 Also, we are placing:
   A at 2 (which is a new position for A, so we can check if it's correct)
   N at 3 (new position for N, previously it was at 4)
   C at 5 (new position for C, previously at 1)

 This seems like a good candidate.

 But note: we must make sure that we are not using any forbidden letters (R and E). ""panic"" does not have R or E.

 So I will go with ""panic"".

 However, let me think of other options to see if there's a better one.

 Another word: ""candy""
   C at 1 -> not allowed.

 Another: ""dance""
   But E is in ""dance"", and we know E is not in the word (from first feedback: E was x). So we cannot use E.

 Another: ""lacks""
   L A C K S -> 
   A at 2 (allowed), C at 3 (allowed), but missing N? We must include N because we know it's in the word.

 Another: ""nacho""
   N A C H O -> 
   N at 1 (allowed, because previously N was at 4), A at 2 (allowed), C at 3 (allowed). 
   But we have H and O as new letters.

 This also includes C, A, N. And avoids R and E.

 So we have two candidates: ""panic"" and ""nacho"".

 Which one is better? 
   ""panic"" tests the positions: 
        A at 2, N at 3, C at 5.
   ""nacho"" tests:
        N at 1, A at 2, C at 3.

 We don't know which positions are correct. But we want to test as many new positions as possible.

 Also, note that in the first guess, we had A at 3 and now we are trying A at 2. Similarly, N was at 4 and now we try at 3 (in panic) or at 1 (in nacho). C was at 1 and now we try at 5 (in panic) or at 3 (in nacho).

 Both are valid. But ""panic"" uses the letter I and P, while ""nacho"" uses H and O. 

 Since we have no information about other letters, we can choose either. I'll go with ""panic"" because it uses more common letters? 

 However, note that we are also testing two new letters. We want to maximize information.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters that are more common in 5-letter words.

 But without more data, I think ""panic"" is a good choice.

 So my second guess is ""panic"".

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** is in the word but not in position 1 (marked `-`).
- **R** is not in the word (marked `x`).
- **A** is in the word but not in position 3 (marked `-`).
- **N** is in the word but not in position 4 (marked `-`).
- **E** is not in the word (marked `x`).

Key deductions:
1. The secret word contains **C, A, N** (but not R or E).
2. **C** cannot be in position 1, **A** cannot be in position 3, and **N** cannot be in position 4.
3. The word must include two additional unknown letters (not R or E).

For the second guess:
- Prioritize testing **C, A, N** in new positions to narrow down locations.
- Avoid repeating invalid positions: no **C** in position 1, no **A** in position 3, no **N** in position 4.
- Introduce new common letters (e.g., **P, I, L, S, T**) to gather more information.
- The word ""**panic**"" fits well:
  - Places **A** at position 2 (new, valid position).
  - Places **N** at position 3 (new, valid position).
  - Places **C** at position 5 (new, valid position).
  - Tests new letters **P** (position 1) and **I** (position 4).
  - Avoids forbidden letters (R, E).

This guess efficiently tests the known letters in fresh positions while probing two new letters.

   C is at position 4 (allowed, because previously it was at 1 and now we avoid 1) 
   But we also have T and H. And we don't know if T and H are in the word.

 However, we also need to include N? Because we know N is in the word. But ""latch"" does not have N. So that won't work.

 We need a word that has C, A, and N.

   P A N I C -> 
   P (new), A at position 2 (allowed, because previously A was at 3), N at position 3 (allowed? previously N was at 4, so position 3 is new), I (new), C at position 5 (allowed, because previously C was at 1).

 So ""panic"" has:

 So we have two candidates: ""panic"" and ""nacho"".

 Which one is better? 
   ""panic"" tests the positions: 
        A at 2, N at 3, C at 5.
   ""nacho"" tests:
        N at 1, A at 2, C at 3.

 We don't know which positions are correct. But we want to test as many new positions as possible.

 Also, note that in the first guess, we had A at 3 and now we are trying A at 2. Similarly, N was at 4 and now we try at 3 (in panic) or at 1 (in nacho). C was at 1 and now we try at 5 (in panic) or at 3 (in nacho).

 Both are valid. But ""panic"" uses the letter I and P, while ""nacho"" uses H and O. 

 Since we have no information about other letters, we can choose either. I'll go with ""panic"" because it uses more common letters?

   We can try to put A in position 1, C in position 3, and N in position 5? But we don't know if that's allowed.

 However, we must form a valid English word.

 Let me brainstorm:

 Option 1: Place A at the beginning? 
   A _ _ _ _ 
   We need to include C and N. Also, we have two more letters.

 Option 2: Place C somewhere else? 

 Since we know the word has C, A, N, and we have two more letters to discover, we can try a word that rearranges these and adds two new letters.

 Common words: 
   ""can"" is only 3 letters, so we need 5.

 How about ""clang""? 
   But note: we have feedback that in the first guess, the letter at position 1 was C (which was marked as present but wrong position). So if we put C at position 1 again, that would be the same as the first guess? But the feedback says C is in the word but not at position 1. So we must avoid putting C at position 1.

 Similarly, we must avoid putting A at position 3 and N at position 4.

 So ""clang"": 
   C at position 1 -> we must avoid because we know C is not at position 1.

 How about ""latch""? 
   L A T C H -> 
   A is at position 2 (which is allowed, because previously it was at 3 and now we avoid 3) 
   C is at position 4 (allowed, because previously it was at 1 and now we avoid 1) 
   But we also have T and H. And we don't know if T and H are in the word.

 However, we also need to include N? Because we know N is in the word. But ""latch"" does not have N. So that won't work.

 We need a word that has C, A, and N.

 How about ""cabin""? 
   C is at position 1 -> not allowed (we know C is not at position 1). 

 How about ""panic""? 
   P A N I C -> 
   P (new), A at position 2 (allowed, because previously A was at 3), N at position 3 (allowed? previously N was at 4, so position 3 is new), I (new), C at position 5 (allowed, because previously C was at 1).

 So ""panic"" has:
   P (new), A (at 2), N (at 3), I (new), C (at 5).

 This word uses the letters: P, A, N, I, C.

 We know the secret word has C, A, N. So we are including them and testing two new letters: P and I.

 Also, we are placing:
   A at 2 (which is a new position for A, so we can check if it's correct)
   N at 3 (new position for N, previously it was at 4)
   C at 5 (new position for C, previously at 1)

 This seems like a good candidate.

 But note: we must make sure that we are not using any forbidden letters (R and E). ""panic"" does not have R or E.

 So I will go with ""panic"".

 However, let me think of other options to see if there's a better one.

 Another word: ""candy""
   C at 1 -> not allowed.

 Another: ""dance""
   But E is in ""dance"", and we know E is not in the word (from first feedback: E was x). So we cannot use E.

 Another: ""lacks""
   L A C K S -> 
   A at 2 (allowed), C at 3 (allowed), but missing N? We must include N because we know it's in the word.

 Another: ""nacho""
   N A C H O -> 
   N at 1 (allowed, because previously N was at 4), A at 2 (allowed), C at 3 (allowed). 
   But we have H and O as new letters.

 This also includes C, A, N. And avoids R and E.

 So we have two candidates: ""panic"" and ""nacho"".

 Which one is better? 
   ""panic"" tests the positions: 
        A at 2, N at 3, C at 5.
   ""nacho"" tests:
        N at 1, A at 2, C at 3.

 We don't know which positions are correct. But we want to test as many new positions as possible.

 Also, note that in the first guess, we had A at 3 and now we are trying A at 2. Similarly, N was at 4 and now we try at 3 (in panic) or at 1 (in nacho). C was at 1 and now we try at 5 (in panic) or at 3 (in nacho).

 Both are valid. But ""panic"" uses the letter I and P, while ""nacho"" uses H and O. 

 Since we have no information about other letters, we can choose either. I'll go with ""panic"" because it uses more common letters? 

 However, note that we are also testing two new letters. We want to maximize information.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters that are more common in 5-letter words.

 But without more data, I think ""panic"" is a good choice.

 So my second guess is ""panic"".

<guess>panic</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** is in the word but not in position 1 (marked `-`).
- **R** is not in the word (marked `x`).
- **A** is in the word but not in position 3 (marked `-`).
- **N** is in the word but not in position 4 (marked `-`).
- **E** is not in the word (marked `x`).

Key deductions:
1. The secret word contains **C, A, N** (but not R or E).
2. **C** cannot be in position 1, **A** cannot be in position 3, and **N** cannot be in position 4.
3. The word must include two additional unknown letters (not R or E).

For the second guess:
- Prioritize testing **C, A, N** in new positions to narrow down locations.
- Avoid repeating invalid positions: no **C** in position 1, no **A** in position 3, no **N** in position 4.
- Introduce new common letters (e.g., **P, I, L, S, T**) to gather more information.
- The word ""**panic**"" fits well:
  - Places **A** at position 2 (new, valid position).
  - Places **N** at position 3 (new, valid position).
  - Places **C** at position 5 (new, valid position).
  - Tests new letters **P** (position 1) and **I** (position 4).
  - Avoids forbidden letters (R, E).

This guess efficiently tests the known letters in fresh positions while probing two new letters.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
Meaning:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

Guess 2: ""panic"" -> P(x), A(✓), N(✓), I(✓), C(✓)
Meaning:
- P is not in the word.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- I is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- C is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So, from guess 2, we know:
- The second letter is A.
- The third letter is N.
- The fourth letter is I.
- The fifth letter is C.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ A N I C

Now, we need to find the first letter. We know from guess 1 that:
- C is in the word but not at position 1. Now we know C is at position 5, so that's consistent.
- A is in the word but not at position 3. Now we have A at position 2, which is different from 3, so that's fine.
- N is in the word but not at position 4. Now we have N at position 3, which is not 4, so that's fine.
- R and E are not in the word, and now we also know P is not in the word.

So the secret word is ? A N I C

We need to find a letter for the first position that:
- Is not R, E, or P (since they are absent).
- Forms a valid English word.

We also know from guess 1 that the first letter cannot be C (because C was at position 1 in ""crane"" and was marked as present but wrong position, meaning position 1 is not C). But now we know C is at position 5, so that's already covered.

What letters can be in the first position? We have to avoid R, E, P, and also we know the letters that are already placed: A, N, I, C. But the first letter could be a new letter or one of the known letters? However, we know that each letter in the word must be accounted for. We have four letters already: A, N, I, C. And the word is five letters, so there must be one more letter.

But note: in the first guess, we had C, A, N (and R and E which are absent). Now we have A, N, I, C. So the word has five distinct letters? Not necessarily, because we don't know if the first letter is a duplicate of one of these. However, from the feedback, we can infer.

In guess 2, we have A, N, I, C all marked as correct (and in position). The only letter that was absent was P. So the secret word must have exactly these four letters plus one more. But wait, the first letter is missing. So the secret word has the letters: [first letter], A, N, I, C.

But note: it's possible that the first letter is a duplicate of one of these? For example, could there be two A's? But in guess 2, we have one A and it's at position 2. If there were two A's, then in guess 1, when we had A at position 3, we might have gotten a different feedback? However, in guess 1, we only had one A and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't rule out a second A. Similarly, in guess 2, we only tested one A and it was correct. So if there were a second A, we wouldn't know.

But let's look at the feedback again.

In guess 1: ""crane"" had A at position 3, and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that there is at least one A in the word, but not at position 3. It doesn't tell us if there are more than one A.

In guess 2: ""panic"" has A at position 2 and it was correct. That doesn't tell us about other A's.

So it's possible that the word has two A's? But then the first letter could be A? But if the first letter were A, then in guess 1, when we had A at position 3, we would have two A's: one at position 1 (if that were the case) and one at position 3. But the feedback for the A at position 3 was that it's present but wrong position. If the word had an A at position 1 and we didn't guess it, then the A at position 3 would still be marked as present (because it's a different occurrence). So that is possible.

However, we also have to consider the first letter. If the first letter is A, then the word would be A A N I C. Is that a word? ""aanic"" doesn't seem like a valid English word. Similarly, we can check for duplicates of other letters.

But let's think: the word must be a valid English word. We know the last four letters are A, N, I, C. So the word ends with ""anic"". What words end with ""anic""?

Common 5-letter words ending with ""anic"": 
- manic (meaning: relating to mania)
- panic (but we know that's not it, and P is absent)
- titanic (too long)
- organic (too long)

Actually, ""manic"" is a word. Also, ""panic"" is a word but we know P is absent. What about other letters?

We can list possible words: 
The word is ? A N I C

Possible first letters: any letter except R, E, P (since they are absent) and also we must avoid C at position 1 (but C is already at position 5, so if we put C at position 1, that would be two C's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so far.

But let's check: in guess 1, we had C at position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. Now we have C at position 5 and it's correct. So if the word had only one C, then the C at position 1 in guess 1 was that same C, but it was in the wrong position. Now we know it's at position 5. So if the word has only one C, then the first letter cannot be C. But if the word has two C's, then it's possible. However, we don't have evidence of two C's.

In guess 2, we have C at position 5 and it's correct. We didn't have any other C in the guess. So if the word had two C's, we wouldn't know. But in guess 1, we had C at position 1 and it was marked as present (but wrong position). That could be the same C or a different one? The feedback doesn't distinguish between multiple occurrences. So it's possible that there are two C's.

But let's see: if the word had two C's, one at position 5 and one at another position, then in guess 1, when we put C at position 1, it would be marked as present (if there is a C at position 1, but we know it's not at position 1, so if there were a C at position 1, it would have been marked as correct, but it was marked as present but wrong position, meaning there is a C but not at 1). So that C must be the same one that is at position 5? Or if there is another C, it would have been marked as present? Actually, if there were two C's, then in guess 1, the C at position 1 would be marked as present (if there is a C elsewhere) and if there is a C at position 1, it would be marked as correct. But it was marked as present but wrong position, so that means there is at least one C, but not at position 1. It doesn't tell us if there are more.

Similarly, in guess 2, we have C at position 5 and it's correct. We don't have any other C, so if there were a second C, we wouldn't know.

But for the word ?ANIC, if we put C at the first position, we get ""canic"". Is that a word? I don't think ""canic"" is a common English word. It might be a proper noun or something, but probably not.

Similarly, if we put A at the first position: ""aanic"" is not a word.

If we put N at the first position: ""nanic"" is not a word.

If we put I at the first position: ""ianic"" is not a word.

So the first letter must be a different letter, not A, N, I, or C? Or it could be a duplicate? But duplicates of these don't form words.

Therefore, the first letter is a new letter, not A, N, I, C, and not R, E, P.

We need to find a letter X such that X + ""anic"" is a word.

Common words:
- manic: M at the beginning. M is not forbidden (we haven't seen M, and it's not R, E, P).
- panic: but P is forbidden, so not possible.
- titanic: too long.
- oceanic: too long.
- organic: too long.

What about ""manic""? That seems the most common.

Are there others?
- ""tunic"" is 5 letters but ends with ""unic"", not ""anic"".
- ""sonic"" ends with ""onic"", not ""anic"".

Actually, ""manic"" is the only common one I can think of.

But let me confirm: is there ""kanic""? Not a word. ""lanic""? Not a word. ""vanic""? Not common. ""danic""? Not a word. ""fanic""? Not a word. ""janic""? Not a word. ""wanic""? Not a word.

So ""manic"" is the only common English word that fits the pattern.

Moreover, we know M has not been tested yet. In the first guess, we had C,R,A,N,E. In the second, P,A,N,I,C. So M has not been used and is not forbidden.

Therefore, the secret word is likely ""manic"".

But let's double-check with the feedback.

If the secret word is ""manic"", then:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: in ""manic"" is at position 5, so in guess 1 at position 1: present but wrong position -> correct (marked -)
- R: not in ""manic"" -> correct (x)
- A: in ""manic"" at position 2, but guessed at position 3: present but wrong position -> correct (-)
- N: in ""manic"" at position 3, guessed at position 4: present but wrong position -> correct (-)
- E: not in ""manic"" -> correct (x)

Guess 2: ""panic""
- P: not in ""manic"" -> correct (x)
- A: in ""manic"" at position 2, guessed at position 2 -> correct (✓)
- N: in ""manic"" at position 3, guessed at position 3 -> correct (✓)
- I: in ""manic"" at position 4, guessed at position 4 -> correct (✓)
- C: in ""manic"" at position 5, guessed at position 5 -> correct (✓)

Perfect match.

So we should guess ""manic"".

But note: we have only one try left? We have used two guesses, so this would be the third. But we are confident.

Is there any other possibility? What about ""tunic""? But ""tunic"" is T U N I C, which would not have A. But we know A is in the word and must be at position 2. So that doesn't work.

Similarly, ""ionic"" is I O N I C, but that has I at position 1 and 4? And no A. But we need A at position 2.

So no, ""manic"" is the only possibility.

Therefore, we guess ""manic"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C is in the word but not in position 1, R is absent, A is in the word but not in position 3, N is in the word but not in position 4, E is absent.
- **Guess 2 (""panic"")**: P is absent, A is correct in position 2, N is correct in position 3, I is correct in position 4, C is correct in position 5.

### Deductions:
1. The secret word has the fixed pattern: `[?] A N I C` (since A, N, I, and C are confirmed in positions 2, 3, 4, and 5).
2. The first letter must be a new letter (not A, N, I, or C) because:
   - Duplicates of these letters in position 1 (e.g., ""AANIC"", ""NANIC"", ""IANIC"", ""CANIC"") do not form valid English words.
3. The first letter cannot be R, E, or P (these are absent from the word).
4. The only common English word fitting `?ANIC` is **""manic""** (meaning relating to mania). Other combinations (e.g., ""kanic"", ""lanic"", ""vanic"") are invalid.

Thus, the secret word must be **manic**.

<guess>manic</guess>",manic,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
Meaning:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

Guess 2: ""panic"" -> P(x), A(✓), N(✓), I(✓), C(✓)
Meaning:
- P is not in the word.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- I is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- C is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So, from guess 2, we know:
- The second letter is A.
- The third letter is N.
- The fourth letter is I.
- The fifth letter is C.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ A N I C

Now, we need to find the first letter. We know from guess 1 that:
- C is in the word but not at position 1. Now we know C is at position 5, so that's consistent.
- A is in the word but not at position 3. Now we have A at position 2, which is different from 3, so that's fine.
- N is in the word but not at position 4. Now we have N at position 3, which is not 4, so that's fine.
- R and E are not in the word, and now we also know P is not in the word.

So the secret word is ? A N I C

We need to find a letter for the first position that:
- Is not R, E, or P (since they are absent).
- Forms a valid English word.

We also know from guess 1 that the first letter cannot be C (because C was at position 1 in ""crane"" and was marked as present but wrong position, meaning position 1 is not C). But now we know C is at position 5, so that's already covered.

What letters can be in the first position? We have to avoid R, E, P, and also we know the letters that are already placed: A, N, I, C. But the first letter could be a new letter or one of the known letters? However, we know that each letter in the word must be accounted for. We have four letters already: A, N, I, C. And the word is five letters, so there must be one more letter.

But note: in the first guess, we had C, A, N (and R and E which are absent). Now we have A, N, I, C. So the word has five distinct letters? Not necessarily, because we don't know if the first letter is a duplicate of one of these. However, from the feedback, we can infer.

In guess 2, we have A, N, I, C all marked as correct (and in position). The only letter that was absent was P. So the secret word must have exactly these four letters plus one more. But wait, the first letter is missing. So the secret word has the letters: [first letter], A, N, I, C.

But note: it's possible that the first letter is a duplicate of one of these? For example, could there be two A's? But in guess 2, we have one A and it's at position 2. If there were two A's, then in guess 1, when we had A at position 3, we might have gotten a different feedback? However, in guess 1, we only had one A and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't rule out a second A. Similarly, in guess 2, we only tested one A and it was correct. So if there were a second A, we wouldn't know.

But let's look at the feedback again.

In guess 1: ""crane"" had A at position 3, and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that there is at least one A in the word, but not at position 3. It doesn't tell us if there are more than one A.

In guess 2: ""panic"" has A at position 2 and it was correct. That doesn't tell us about other A's.

So it's possible that the word has two A's? But then the first letter could be A? But if the first letter were A, then in guess 1, when we had A at position 3, we would have two A's: one at position 1 (if that were the case) and one at position 3. But the feedback for the A at position 3 was that it's present but wrong position. If the word had an A at position 1 and we didn't guess it, then the A at position 3 would still be marked as present (because it's a different occurrence). So that is possible.

However, we also have to consider the first letter. If the first letter is A, then the word would be A A N I C. Is that a word? ""aanic"" doesn't seem like a valid English word. Similarly, we can check for duplicates of other letters.

But let's think: the word must be a valid English word. We know the last four letters are A, N, I, C. So the word ends with ""anic"". What words end with ""anic""?

Common 5-letter words ending with ""anic"": 
- manic (meaning: relating to mania)
- panic (but we know that's not it, and P is absent)
- titanic (too long)
- organic (too long)

Actually, ""manic"" is a word. Also, ""panic"" is a word but we know P is absent. What about other letters?

We can list possible words: 
The word is ? A N I C

Possible first letters: any letter except R, E, P (since they are absent) and also we must avoid C at position 1 (but C is already at position 5, so if we put C at position 1, that would be two C's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so far.

But let's check: in guess 1, we had C at position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. Now we have C at position 5 and it's correct. So if the word had only one C, then the C at position 1 in guess 1 was that same C, but it was in the wrong position. Now we know it's at position 5. So if the word has only one C, then the first letter cannot be C. But if the word has two C's, then it's possible. However, we don't have evidence of two C's.

In guess 2, we have C at position 5 and it's correct. We didn't have any other C in the guess. So if the word had two C's, we wouldn't know. But in guess 1, we had C at position 1 and it was marked as present (but wrong position). That could be the same C or a different one? The feedback doesn't distinguish between multiple occurrences. So it's possible that there are two C's.

But let's see: if the word had two C's, one at position 5 and one at another position, then in guess 1, when we put C at position 1, it would be marked as present (if there is a C at position 1, but we know it's not at position 1, so if there were a C at position 1, it would have been marked as correct, but it was marked as present but wrong position, meaning there is a C but not at 1). So that C must be the same one that is at position 5? Or if there is another C, it would have been marked as present? Actually, if there were two C's, then in guess 1, the C at position 1 would be marked as present (if there is a C elsewhere) and if there is a C at position 1, it would be marked as correct. But it was marked as present but wrong position, so that means there is at least one C, but not at position 1. It doesn't tell us if there are more.

Similarly, in guess 2, we have C at position 5 and it's correct. We don't have any other C, so if there were a second C, we wouldn't know.

But for the word ?ANIC, if we put C at the first position, we get ""canic"". Is that a word? I don't think ""canic"" is a common English word. It might be a proper noun or something, but probably not.

Similarly, if we put A at the first position: ""aanic"" is not a word.

If we put N at the first position: ""nanic"" is not a word.

If we put I at the first position: ""ianic"" is not a word.

So the first letter must be a different letter, not A, N, I, or C? Or it could be a duplicate? But duplicates of these don't form words.

Therefore, the first letter is a new letter, not A, N, I, C, and not R, E, P.

We need to find a letter X such that X + ""anic"" is a word.

Common words:
- manic: M at the beginning. M is not forbidden (we haven't seen M, and it's not R, E, P).
- panic: but P is forbidden, so not possible.
- titanic: too long.
- oceanic: too long.
- organic: too long.

What about ""manic""? That seems the most common.

Are there others?
- ""tunic"" is 5 letters but ends with ""unic"", not ""anic"".
- ""sonic"" ends with ""onic"", not ""anic"".

Actually, ""manic"" is the only common one I can think of.

But let me confirm: is there ""kanic""? Not a word. ""lanic""? Not a word. ""vanic""? Not common. ""danic""? Not a word. ""fanic""? Not a word. ""janic""? Not a word. ""wanic""? Not a word.

So ""manic"" is the only common English word that fits the pattern.

Moreover, we know M has not been tested yet. In the first guess, we had C,R,A,N,E. In the second, P,A,N,I,C. So M has not been used and is not forbidden.

Therefore, the secret word is likely ""manic"".

But let's double-check with the feedback.

If the secret word is ""manic"", then:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: in ""manic"" is at position 5, so in guess 1 at position 1: present but wrong position -> correct (marked -)
- R: not in ""manic"" -> correct (x)
- A: in ""manic"" at position 2, but guessed at position 3: present but wrong position -> correct (-)
- N: in ""manic"" at position 3, guessed at position 4: present but wrong position -> correct (-)
- E: not in ""manic"" -> correct (x)

Guess 2: ""panic""
- P: not in ""manic"" -> correct (x)
- A: in ""manic"" at position 2, guessed at position 2 -> correct (✓)
- N: in ""manic"" at position 3, guessed at position 3 -> correct (✓)
- I: in ""manic"" at position 4, guessed at position 4 -> correct (✓)
- C: in ""manic"" at position 5, guessed at position 5 -> correct (✓)

Perfect match.

So we should guess ""manic"".

But note: we have only one try left? We have used two guesses, so this would be the third. But we are confident.

Is there any other possibility? What about ""tunic""? But ""tunic"" is T U N I C, which would not have A. But we know A is in the word and must be at position 2. So that doesn't work.

Similarly, ""ionic"" is I O N I C, but that has I at position 1 and 4? And no A. But we need A at position 2.

So no, ""manic"" is the only possibility.

Therefore, we guess ""manic"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C is in the word but not in position 1, R is absent, A is in the word but not in position 3, N is in the word but not in position 4, E is absent.
- **Guess 2 (""panic"")**: P is absent, A is correct in position 2, N is correct in position 3, I is correct in position 4, C is correct in position 5.

### Deductions:
1. The secret word has the fixed pattern: `[?] A N I C` (since A, N, I, and C are confirmed in positions 2, 3, 4, and 5).
2. The first letter must be a new letter (not A, N, I, or C) because:
   - Duplicates of these letters in position 1 (e.g., ""AANIC"", ""NANIC"", ""IANIC"", ""CANIC"") do not form valid English words.
3. The first letter cannot be R, E, or P (these are absent from the word).
4. The only common English word fitting `?ANIC` is **""manic""** (meaning relating to mania). Other combinations (e.g., ""kanic"", ""lanic"", ""vanic"") are invalid.

Thus, the secret word must be **manic**.",Guess 3: manic -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) N(✓) I(✓) C(✓),SUCCESS
