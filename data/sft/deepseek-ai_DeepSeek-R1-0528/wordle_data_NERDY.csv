 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 A good starting word is one that has common letters and no repeating letters. 
 Some popular starting words are: CRANE, SLATE, AUDIO, STARE, ROATE, etc.

 I choose ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).

First, let's analyze the feedback from the first guess. The word was ""crane"", and the feedback is:

- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this:

- Letters C and A are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in the first position (since it was guessed there).
- N is in the word but not in the fourth position.
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

Also, since R, N, and E are all present, they must be somewhere else in the word.

Now, the secret word is a 5-letter word containing R, N, and E, but not C or A.

We need to make a new guess that incorporates this information.

Available letters: R, N, E must be included, but in different positions since their current positions are wrong.

Specifically:

- R is not in position 1 (we guessed it there).
- N is not in position 4.
- E is not in position 5.

Also, we need to choose positions where R, N, E can be placed.

Moreover, since C and A are out, we should avoid using them in the new guess.

The word must consist of letters including R, N, E, and two other letters that are not C or A. But we don't know what those are yet.

Possible letters: Since common letters, we might consider other vowels or consonants.

But E is already in the word; it's a vowel, so there might be other vowels.

The secret word has R, N, E, so it must contain these three, and two more letters.

We need to guess a word that includes R, N, E in positions different from the first guess.

In ""crane"":

Positions:
1: C (x)
2: R (-)
3: A (x)
4: N (-)
5: E (-)

So:
- Position 1: not C
- Position 2: not R, but R is in the word
- Position 3: not A
- Position 4: not N
- Position 5: not E

R must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5 but not 2. Positions available: 1,3,4,5 since it can't be in 2.

Similarly, N cannot be in 4, so it must be in 1,2,3, or 5.

E cannot be in 5, so it must be in 1,2,3, or 4.

Also, positions 1 and 3 are now open, since C and A are out.

In the new guess, I need to place R, N, E in different positions.

Moreover, the word should be a valid English word.

I could use a word that has R, N, E but rearranged.

Common words with R, N, E: for example, ""inner"" but that has N twice, and E, but E is not in position 5? Let's not assume.

Better to think of words without repeating letters if possible.

Since we have feedback that R, N, E are present, we want to reposition them.

Also, we need to include two new letters that might be in the word or not.

A strategic guess would be to place R, N, E in possible positions and introduce new letters.

Let me brainstorm some words that contain R, N, E, but not C or A.

For example:

- ""liner"": but L is another letter, and E is at the end. In ""crane"", E is at position 5, but feedback shows E is wrong position, so in secret word, E is not at position 5, but could be elsewhere. In ""liner"", if E is at position 5, but secret E not at 5, so not suitable.

If I guess ""liner"", and E is at 5, but if secret has E not at 5, that might not be good, but in this case, since E must be elsewhere, guessing a word with E at 5 would give feedback, but it might be inefficient if E is fixed elsewhere.

I should avoid placing E at position 5 again, similarly for others.

Let me consider possible positions:

From feedback:

- R cannot be at position 2. Possible positions for R: 1,3,4,5

- N cannot be at position 4. Possible: 1,2,3,5

- E cannot be at position 5. Possible: 1,2,3,4

Also, since R, N, E are all in the word, and word has two more letters.

Now, for the new guess, I need to choose positions for R,N,E and two other letters.

I should choose common letters not yet tried. C and A are out, so avoid them.

Letters not tried: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Vowels: I,O,U are possible; consonants: many.

Since E is already a vowel, perhaps others are consonants.

But we don't know.

To maximize information, a good approach is to include letters that are common and not yet tested.

But in this case, we already know R,N,E are present, so I should focus on finding their positions and testing new letters.

Standard advice in Wordle is to reuse the present letters but in new positions to find their locations.

So, for the second guess, I should create a word that includes R,N,E, but in positions different from before.

Specifically:

- R not at 2

- N not at 4

- E not at 5

And introduce new letters.

Let me think of words with R,N,E.

Possible words: 
- ""rinse"": positions: R at 1, I at 2, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5. But E is at position 5, which is forbidden because from feedback, E cannot be at position 5. So guessing ""rinse"" would have E at position 5, which we know is wrong, so it's inefficient; we might waste that position.

Similarly, if I guess E at 5, I know it will be wrong, so better to place E elsewhere.

For example:
- ""reign"": R at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5. Now, positions: R at position 1 (was not position 1 before, but no feedback against position 1 yet), E at position 2 (previously not tested there), N at position 5 (previously not position 4, but position 5 is new).

In ""crane"", we only know that R is not at 2, N not at 4, E not at 5. Position 1 could have R or something else.

In ""reign"":
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: I (new)
- Position 4: G (new)
- Position 5: N

N at position 5: previously, N was at position 4 and wrong, so position 5 could be possible for N.

E at position 2: previously E was at position 5 and wrong, so position 2 could be possible.

Similarly, R at position 1: previously R was at position 2 and wrong, so position 1 could be correct or wrong position.

This seems reasonable.

Another word: ""nerve"" but has E twice and R repeat, might not be ideal.

""hinge"" – has H,I,N,G,E – position 5 is E, but E cannot be at 5, so avoid.

""miner"" – M,I,N,E,R – positions: M at 1, I at 2, N at 3, E at 4, R at 5. N at position 3, E at position 4 (not 5), R at position 5. Possible.

Let's list:

- ""reign"" : R at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5

- ""inter"" : I at 1, N at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5. E at position 4.

- ""inert"" : similar to inter but with T, I,N,E,R,T? ""inert"" is I,N,E,R,T positions: I at1, N at2, E at3, R at4, T at5. But N at position 2? Previously N was not at position 4, but position 2 could be possible.

Possible candidates:

- ""reign"" : R,E,I,G,N — with E at position 2 and N at position 5.

""reign"" might not be the most common word, but it's valid.

- ""mince"" — but C is out! C is not in word, avoid C.

C is confirmed not in word, so don't use C.

Similarly, A not in word.

So, letters to avoid: C, A.

""miner"" : M,I,N,E,R — no C or A.

Positions: M at1, I at2, N at3, E at4, R at5.

Then:
- Position 1: M new
- Position 2: I new
- Position 3: N — previously N was at position 4 and wrong; position 3 is new for N
- Position 4: E — previously E was at position 5 and wrong; position 4 is new for E
- Position 5: R — previously R was at position 2 and wrong; position 5 is new for R

All positions for R,N,E are new, and we introduce M and I.

This seems good.

Another one: ""liner"" : L,I,N,E,R — N at3, E at4, R at5 — E at position 4, not 5.

Similarly.

But ""liner"" has L and I new.

""miner"" might be better because of common letters.

Perhaps ""point"" but no E? But we must include E because it's in the word. No, we know E is in the word, so the guess must include E to gather more position info, but we can choose not to include it if we want to test other letters, but since we know it's in, better to include it to pin its position.

Standard strategy is to include confirmed letters in new positions.

Similarly for R and N.

So yes.

Other words: ""bakes"" but A is invalid, and K,S new, but no R or N? Must include R,N,E? Not necessarily, but if I don't include them, I might not get position info.

For example, I could guess a word with entirely new letters to test new ones, leaving R,N,E positions unknown later.

But that might be less efficient because I have three known letters.

Typically, it's better to reposition the known present letters.

So I think ""miner"" is a good choice.

"" reign"" and ""miner"", both fine.

""inter"" : I,N,T,E,R — positions: I at1, N at2, T at3, E at4, R at5

N at position 2: possible, no feedback against position 2 for N.

Similarly E at4, R at5.

Introducing I and T.

I is a common vowel.

Let's decide: I'll go with ""miner"" for now.

But ""miner"" has N at position 3 and E at position 4.

In the secret word, R must be placed: if not in position 2, and in this guess, if I have R at position 5, etc.

Another word: ""rouse"" — R,O,U,S,E — but E at position 5 again, which is invalid position for E, so avoid.

Similarly, ""serve"" E at end.

Avoid any E at position 5.

Also, N not at position 4, so avoid placing N at position 4.

In my guess, I shouldn't place N at position 4 or E at position 5, because I know those are wrong.

In ""miner"", I placed N at position 3, E at position 4 — position 3 and 4 are both different from previous.

Previous: N was at position 4, now I place at position 3; E was at position 5, now at position 4; R was at position 2, now at position 5. All different positions.

Good.

Similarly in ""inter"": N at position 2, E at 4, R at 5.

Position 2 for N: possible, since N was at position 4 before and wrong, but position 2 could be correct.

No restriction.

I think ""miner"" is fine.

But let me confirm the word is valid. Yes.

Perhaps I can consider ""shine"" but no R? ""shine"" has S,H,I,N,E — missing R.

Must include R? Not necessarily, but if I guess ""shine"", I test S,H,I,N,E with N at position 4? Position 4: but N cannot be at position 4 from previous feedback? In ""crane"", N at position 4 was wrong, so if I guess ""shine"" with N at position 4, it will be wrong, wasted opportunity.

In ""shine"": positions: S at1, H at2, I at3, N at4, E at5

N at position 4: we know from feedback that position 4 is not N, so guessing N at position 4 will definitely get ""x"" or ""-"" but since we know it's wrong position, if it's ""-"" it means N is in word but not here, which we know, or ""x"" meaning not, but we know N is in word, so if I place N at position 4, I get ""-"" meaning wrong position, which we already know, or if it mistakenly ""x"" but since N is in word, it should be ""-"" . Feedback symbol: if letter in word but wrong position, ""-""; if not in word, ""x"".

Since we know N is in the word, if I place N at a wrong position, I will get ""-"", which doesn't give new information; it just confirms it's wrong, which we infer.

Specifically, if I deliberately place N at position 4, which we know is wrong, I will get ""-"" meaning it's still wrong position, but we already know that, so it doesn't help. Similarly, placing E at position 5 will get ""-"" meaning wrong position, which we know.

Therefore, it's inefficient; better to place at new positions to possibly get ""correct"" or new info.

So, in the guess, avoid placing R at position 2, N at position 4, E at position 5.

In fact, avoid those specific positions for those letters.

In the new guess, for letters we know are present but position wrong, do not place them in positions they were before if possible; place them where they could be correct.

Here, I need to place R not at 2, N not at 4, E not at 5.

So, for R: possible positions 1,3,4,5

N: 1,2,3,5

E: 1,2,3,4

Therefore, when forming a word, I should assign positions accordingly.

In ""miner"": M at1, I at2, N at3, E at4, R at5

So R at position 5: which is allowed since previously at 2, not here.

N at position 3: allowed, not position 4.

E at position 4: allowed, not position 5.

Also, position 4 for E: previously E was at position 5, now position 4 might be correct.

Similarly.

In ""reign"": R at1, E at2, I at3, G at4, N at5

E at position 2: not 5, ok.

N at position 5: not 4, ok.

R at position 1: not 2, ok.

Both are good.

I'll choose ""miner"" since ""miner"" has common consonants.

Another option: ""point"" no, must have E? No, but E is in word, so better include.

To be efficient.

I'll go with ""miner"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":

- C and A are not in the secret word (both marked ""x"").
- R, N, and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions:
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - N cannot be in position 4.
  - E cannot be in position 5.
- Therefore, the secret word contains R, N, and E elsewhere, along with two unknown letters.

For this second guess:
- We need to place R, N, and E in new possible positions to narrow down their locations:
  - R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
  - N can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
  - E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- We should avoid using C or A, as they are confirmed not in the word.
- The guess should introduce new, common letters to test for their presence and positions.
- ""miner"" is a valid 5-letter word that includes R, N, and E in repositioned locations:
  - R is at position 5 (new position, avoiding position 2).
  - N is at position 3 (new position, avoiding position 4).
  - E is at position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).
- It introduces M and I, two new vowels/consonants that are common and haven't been tested yet.
- This guess efficiently reuses known present letters while exploring new positions and letters.

<guess>miner</guess>",miner,"First, let's analyze the feedback from the first guess. The word was ""crane"", and the feedback is:

- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this:

- Letters C and A are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in the first position (since it was guessed there).
- N is in the word but not in the fourth position.
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

Also, since R, N, and E are all present, they must be somewhere else in the word.

5: E (-)

So:
- Position 1: not C

- Position 3: not A
- Position 4: not N
- Position 5: not E

R must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5 but not 2. Positions available: 1,3,4,5 since it can't be in 2.

Similarly, N cannot be in 4, so it must be in 1,2,3, or 5.

E cannot be in 5, so it must be in 1,2,3, or 4.

Also, positions 1 and 3 are now open, since C and A are out.

In the new guess, I need to place R, N, E in different positions.

Moreover, the word should be a valid English word.

I could use a word that has R, N, E but rearranged.

Common words with R, N, E: for example, ""inner"" but that has N twice, and E, but E is not in position 5? Let's not assume.

Better to think of words without repeating letters if possible.

Since we have feedback that R, N, E are present, we want to reposition them.

- N cannot be at position 4. Possible: 1,2,3,5

- E cannot be at position 5. Possible: 1,2,3,4

Also, since R, N, E are all in the word, and word has two more letters.

Now, for the new guess, I need to choose positions for R,N,E and two other letters.

I should choose common letters not yet tried. C and A are out, so avoid them.

Letters not tried: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Vowels: I,O,U are possible; consonants: many.

Since E is already a vowel, perhaps others are consonants.

- ""reign"": R at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5. Now, positions: R at position 1 (was not position 1 before, but no feedback against position 1 yet), E at position 2 (previously not tested there), N at position 5 (previously not position 4, but position 5 is new).

In ""crane"", we only know that R is not at 2, N not at 4, E not at 5. Position 1 could have R or something else.

In ""reign"":
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: I (new)
- Position 4: G (new)
- Position 5: N

N at position 5: previously, N was at position 4 and wrong, so position 5 could be possible for N.

E at position 2: previously E was at position 5 and wrong, so position 2 could be possible.

Similarly, R at position 1: previously R was at position 2 and wrong, so position 1 could be correct or wrong position.

This seems reasonable.

Another word: ""nerve"" but has E twice and R repeat, might not be ideal.

""hinge"" – has H,I,N,G,E – position 5 is E, but E cannot be at 5, so avoid.

""miner"" – M,I,N,E,R – positions: M at 1, I at 2, N at 3, E at 4, R at 5. N at position 3, E at position 4 (not 5), R at position 5. Possible.

Let's list:

- ""reign"" : R at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5

- ""inter"" : I at 1, N at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5. E at position 4.

- ""inert"" : similar to inter but with T, I,N,E,R,T? ""inert"" is I,N,E,R,T positions: I at1, N at2, E at3, R at4, T at5. But N at position 2? Previously N was not at position 4, but position 2 could be possible.

Possible candidates:

- ""reign"" : R,E,I,G,N — with E at position 2 and N at position 5.

""reign"" might not be the most common word, but it's valid.

- ""mince"" — but C is out! C is not in word, avoid C.

C is confirmed not in word, so don't use C.

Similarly, A not in word.

So, letters to avoid: C, A.

""miner"" : M,I,N,E,R — no C or A.

Positions: M at1, I at2, N at3, E at4, R at5.

Then:
- Position 1: M new
- Position 2: I new
- Position 3: N — previously N was at position 4 and wrong; position 3 is new for N
- Position 4: E — previously E was at position 5 and wrong; position 4 is new for E
- Position 5: R — previously R was at position 2 and wrong; position 5 is new for R

All positions for R,N,E are new, and we introduce M and I.

This seems good.

Another one: ""liner"" : L,I,N,E,R — N at3, E at4, R at5 — E at position 4, not 5.

Similarly.

But ""liner"" has L and I new.

""miner"" might be better because of common letters.

Perhaps ""point"" but no E? But we must include E because it's in the word. No, we know E is in the word, so the guess must include E to gather more position info, but we can choose not to include it if we want to test other letters, but since we know it's in, better to include it to pin its position.

Standard strategy is to include confirmed letters in new positions.

Similarly for R and N.

So yes.

Other words: ""bakes"" but A is invalid, and K,S new, but no R or N? Must include R,N,E? Not necessarily, but if I don't include them, I might not get position info.

For example, I could guess a word with entirely new letters to test new ones, leaving R,N,E positions unknown later.

But that might be less efficient because I have three known letters.

Typically, it's better to reposition the known present letters.

So I think ""miner"" is a good choice.

"" reign"" and ""miner"", both fine.

""inter"" : I,N,T,E,R — positions: I at1, N at2, T at3, E at4, R at5

N at position 2: possible, no feedback against position 2 for N.

Similarly E at4, R at5.

Introducing I and T.

I is a common vowel.

Let's decide: I'll go with ""miner"" for now.

But ""miner"" has N at position 3 and E at position 4.

In the secret word, R must be placed: if not in position 2, and in this guess, if I have R at position 5, etc.

Another word: ""rouse"" — R,O,U,S,E — but E at position 5 again, which is invalid position for E, so avoid.

Similarly, ""serve"" E at end.

Avoid any E at position 5.

Also, N not at position 4, so avoid placing N at position 4.

In my guess, I shouldn't place N at position 4 or E at position 5, because I know those are wrong.

In ""miner"", I placed N at position 3, E at position 4 — position 3 and 4 are both different from previous.

Previous: N was at position 4, now I place at position 3; E was at position 5, now at position 4; R was at position 2, now at position 5. All different positions.

Good.

Similarly in ""inter"": N at position 2, E at 4, R at 5.

Position 2 for N: possible, since N was at position 4 before and wrong, but position 2 could be correct.

No restriction.

I think ""miner"" is fine.

But let me confirm the word is valid. Yes.

Perhaps I can consider ""shine"" but no R? ""shine"" has S,H,I,N,E — missing R.

Must include R? Not necessarily, but if I guess ""shine"", I test S,H,I,N,E with N at position 4? Position 4: but N cannot be at position 4 from previous feedback? In ""crane"", N at position 4 was wrong, so if I guess ""shine"" with N at position 4, it will be wrong, wasted opportunity.

In ""shine"": positions: S at1, H at2, I at3, N at4, E at5

N at position 4: we know from feedback that position 4 is not N, so guessing N at position 4 will definitely get ""x"" or ""-"" but since we know it's wrong position, if it's ""-"" it means N is in word but not here, which we know, or ""x"" meaning not, but we know N is in word, so if I place N at position 4, I get ""-"" meaning wrong position, which we already know, or if it mistakenly ""x"" but since N is in word, it should be ""-"" . Feedback symbol: if letter in word but wrong position, ""-""; if not in word, ""x"".

Since we know N is in the word, if I place N at a wrong position, I will get ""-"", which doesn't give new information; it just confirms it's wrong, which we infer.

Specifically, if I deliberately place N at position 4, which we know is wrong, I will get ""-"" meaning it's still wrong position, but we already know that, so it doesn't help. Similarly, placing E at position 5 will get ""-"" meaning wrong position, which we know.

Therefore, it's inefficient; better to place at new positions to possibly get ""correct"" or new info.

So, in the guess, avoid placing R at position 2, N at position 4, E at position 5.

In fact, avoid those specific positions for those letters.

In the new guess, for letters we know are present but position wrong, do not place them in positions they were before if possible; place them where they could be correct.

Here, I need to place R not at 2, N not at 4, E not at 5.

So, for R: possible positions 1,3,4,5

N: 1,2,3,5

E: 1,2,3,4

Therefore, when forming a word, I should assign positions accordingly.

In ""miner"": M at1, I at2, N at3, E at4, R at5

So R at position 5: which is allowed since previously at 2, not here.

N at position 3: allowed, not position 4.

E at position 4: allowed, not position 5.

Also, position 4 for E: previously E was at position 5, now position 4 might be correct.

Similarly.

In ""reign"": R at1, E at2, I at3, G at4, N at5

E at position 2: not 5, ok.

N at position 5: not 4, ok.

R at position 1: not 2, ok.

Both are good.

I'll choose ""miner"" since ""miner"" has common consonants.

Another option: ""point"" no, must have E? No, but E is in word, so better include.

To be efficient.

I'll go with ""miner"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":

- C and A are not in the secret word (both marked ""x"").
- R, N, and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions:
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - N cannot be in position 4.
  - E cannot be in position 5.
- Therefore, the secret word contains R, N, and E elsewhere, along with two unknown letters.

For this second guess:
- We need to place R, N, and E in new possible positions to narrow down their locations:
  - R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
  - N can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
  - E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- We should avoid using C or A, as they are confirmed not in the word.
- The guess should introduce new, common letters to test for their presence and positions.
- ""miner"" is a valid 5-letter word that includes R, N, and E in repositioned locations:
  - R is at position 5 (new position, avoiding position 2).
  - N is at position 3 (new position, avoiding position 4).
  - E is at position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).
- It introduces M and I, two new vowels/consonants that are common and haven't been tested yet.
- This guess efficiently reuses known present letters while exploring new positions and letters.",Guess 2: miner -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(-) E(-) R(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,NERDY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and maximizes the information we get.
 Common vowels in English: A, E, I, O, U
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 A good starting word is one that has common letters and no repeating letters. 
 Some popular starting words are: CRANE, SLATE, AUDIO, STARE, ROATE, etc.

 I choose ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N). 
 It covers a good set of letters and is a valid 5-letter word.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>First, let's analyze the feedback from the first guess. The word was ""crane"", and the feedback is:

- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this:

- Letters C and A are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in the first position (since it was guessed there).
- N is in the word but not in the fourth position.
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

Also, since R, N, and E are all present, they must be somewhere else in the word.

Now, the secret word is a 5-letter word containing R, N, and E, but not C or A.

We need to make a new guess that incorporates this information.

Available letters: R, N, E must be included, but in different positions since their current positions are wrong.

Specifically:

- R is not in position 1 (we guessed it there).
- N is not in position 4.
- E is not in position 5.

Also, we need to choose positions where R, N, E can be placed.

Moreover, since C and A are out, we should avoid using them in the new guess.

The word must consist of letters including R, N, E, and two other letters that are not C or A. But we don't know what those are yet.

Possible letters: Since common letters, we might consider other vowels or consonants.

But E is already in the word; it's a vowel, so there might be other vowels.

The secret word has R, N, E, so it must contain these three, and two more letters.

We need to guess a word that includes R, N, E in positions different from the first guess.

In ""crane"":

Positions:
1: C (x)
2: R (-)
3: A (x)
4: N (-)
5: E (-)

So:
- Position 1: not C
- Position 2: not R, but R is in the word
- Position 3: not A
- Position 4: not N
- Position 5: not E

R must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5 but not 2. Positions available: 1,3,4,5 since it can't be in 2.

Similarly, N cannot be in 4, so it must be in 1,2,3, or 5.

E cannot be in 5, so it must be in 1,2,3, or 4.

Also, positions 1 and 3 are now open, since C and A are out.

In the new guess, I need to place R, N, E in different positions.

Moreover, the word should be a valid English word.

I could use a word that has R, N, E but rearranged.

Common words with R, N, E: for example, ""inner"" but that has N twice, and E, but E is not in position 5? Let's not assume.

Better to think of words without repeating letters if possible.

Since we have feedback that R, N, E are present, we want to reposition them.

Also, we need to include two new letters that might be in the word or not.

A strategic guess would be to place R, N, E in possible positions and introduce new letters.

Let me brainstorm some words that contain R, N, E, but not C or A.

For example:

- ""liner"": but L is another letter, and E is at the end. In ""crane"", E is at position 5, but feedback shows E is wrong position, so in secret word, E is not at position 5, but could be elsewhere. In ""liner"", if E is at position 5, but secret E not at 5, so not suitable.

If I guess ""liner"", and E is at 5, but if secret has E not at 5, that might not be good, but in this case, since E must be elsewhere, guessing a word with E at 5 would give feedback, but it might be inefficient if E is fixed elsewhere.

I should avoid placing E at position 5 again, similarly for others.

Let me consider possible positions:

From feedback:

- R cannot be at position 2. Possible positions for R: 1,3,4,5

- N cannot be at position 4. Possible: 1,2,3,5

- E cannot be at position 5. Possible: 1,2,3,4

Also, since R, N, E are all in the word, and word has two more letters.

Now, for the new guess, I need to choose positions for R,N,E and two other letters.

I should choose common letters not yet tried. C and A are out, so avoid them.

Letters not tried: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Vowels: I,O,U are possible; consonants: many.

Since E is already a vowel, perhaps others are consonants.

But we don't know.

To maximize information, a good approach is to include letters that are common and not yet tested.

But in this case, we already know R,N,E are present, so I should focus on finding their positions and testing new letters.

Standard advice in Wordle is to reuse the present letters but in new positions to find their locations.

So, for the second guess, I should create a word that includes R,N,E, but in positions different from before.

Specifically:

- R not at 2

- N not at 4

- E not at 5

And introduce new letters.

Let me think of words with R,N,E.

Possible words: 
- ""rinse"": positions: R at 1, I at 2, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5. But E is at position 5, which is forbidden because from feedback, E cannot be at position 5. So guessing ""rinse"" would have E at position 5, which we know is wrong, so it's inefficient; we might waste that position.

Similarly, if I guess E at 5, I know it will be wrong, so better to place E elsewhere.

For example:
- ""reign"": R at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5. Now, positions: R at position 1 (was not position 1 before, but no feedback against position 1 yet), E at position 2 (previously not tested there), N at position 5 (previously not position 4, but position 5 is new).

In ""crane"", we only know that R is not at 2, N not at 4, E not at 5. Position 1 could have R or something else.

In ""reign"":
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: I (new)
- Position 4: G (new)
- Position 5: N

N at position 5: previously, N was at position 4 and wrong, so position 5 could be possible for N.

E at position 2: previously E was at position 5 and wrong, so position 2 could be possible.

Similarly, R at position 1: previously R was at position 2 and wrong, so position 1 could be correct or wrong position.

This seems reasonable.

Another word: ""nerve"" but has E twice and R repeat, might not be ideal.

""hinge"" – has H,I,N,G,E – position 5 is E, but E cannot be at 5, so avoid.

""miner"" – M,I,N,E,R – positions: M at 1, I at 2, N at 3, E at 4, R at 5. N at position 3, E at position 4 (not 5), R at position 5. Possible.

Let's list:

- ""reign"" : R at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5

- ""inter"" : I at 1, N at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5. E at position 4.

- ""inert"" : similar to inter but with T, I,N,E,R,T? ""inert"" is I,N,E,R,T positions: I at1, N at2, E at3, R at4, T at5. But N at position 2? Previously N was not at position 4, but position 2 could be possible.

Possible candidates:

- ""reign"" : R,E,I,G,N — with E at position 2 and N at position 5.

""reign"" might not be the most common word, but it's valid.

- ""mince"" — but C is out! C is not in word, avoid C.

C is confirmed not in word, so don't use C.

Similarly, A not in word.

So, letters to avoid: C, A.

""miner"" : M,I,N,E,R — no C or A.

Positions: M at1, I at2, N at3, E at4, R at5.

Then:
- Position 1: M new
- Position 2: I new
- Position 3: N — previously N was at position 4 and wrong; position 3 is new for N
- Position 4: E — previously E was at position 5 and wrong; position 4 is new for E
- Position 5: R — previously R was at position 2 and wrong; position 5 is new for R

All positions for R,N,E are new, and we introduce M and I.

This seems good.

Another one: ""liner"" : L,I,N,E,R — N at3, E at4, R at5 — E at position 4, not 5.

Similarly.

But ""liner"" has L and I new.

""miner"" might be better because of common letters.

Perhaps ""point"" but no E? But we must include E because it's in the word. No, we know E is in the word, so the guess must include E to gather more position info, but we can choose not to include it if we want to test other letters, but since we know it's in, better to include it to pin its position.

Standard strategy is to include confirmed letters in new positions.

Similarly for R and N.

So yes.

Other words: ""bakes"" but A is invalid, and K,S new, but no R or N? Must include R,N,E? Not necessarily, but if I don't include them, I might not get position info.

For example, I could guess a word with entirely new letters to test new ones, leaving R,N,E positions unknown later.

But that might be less efficient because I have three known letters.

Typically, it's better to reposition the known present letters.

So I think ""miner"" is a good choice.

"" reign"" and ""miner"", both fine.

""inter"" : I,N,T,E,R — positions: I at1, N at2, T at3, E at4, R at5

N at position 2: possible, no feedback against position 2 for N.

Similarly E at4, R at5.

Introducing I and T.

I is a common vowel.

Let's decide: I'll go with ""miner"" for now.

But ""miner"" has N at position 3 and E at position 4.

In the secret word, R must be placed: if not in position 2, and in this guess, if I have R at position 5, etc.

Another word: ""rouse"" — R,O,U,S,E — but E at position 5 again, which is invalid position for E, so avoid.

Similarly, ""serve"" E at end.

Avoid any E at position 5.

Also, N not at position 4, so avoid placing N at position 4.

In my guess, I shouldn't place N at position 4 or E at position 5, because I know those are wrong.

In ""miner"", I placed N at position 3, E at position 4 — position 3 and 4 are both different from previous.

Previous: N was at position 4, now I place at position 3; E was at position 5, now at position 4; R was at position 2, now at position 5. All different positions.

Good.

Similarly in ""inter"": N at position 2, E at 4, R at 5.

Position 2 for N: possible, since N was at position 4 before and wrong, but position 2 could be correct.

No restriction.

I think ""miner"" is fine.

But let me confirm the word is valid. Yes.

Perhaps I can consider ""shine"" but no R? ""shine"" has S,H,I,N,E — missing R.

Must include R? Not necessarily, but if I guess ""shine"", I test S,H,I,N,E with N at position 4? Position 4: but N cannot be at position 4 from previous feedback? In ""crane"", N at position 4 was wrong, so if I guess ""shine"" with N at position 4, it will be wrong, wasted opportunity.

In ""shine"": positions: S at1, H at2, I at3, N at4, E at5

N at position 4: we know from feedback that position 4 is not N, so guessing N at position 4 will definitely get ""x"" or ""-"" but since we know it's wrong position, if it's ""-"" it means N is in word but not here, which we know, or ""x"" meaning not, but we know N is in word, so if I place N at position 4, I get ""-"" meaning wrong position, which we already know, or if it mistakenly ""x"" but since N is in word, it should be ""-"" . Feedback symbol: if letter in word but wrong position, ""-""; if not in word, ""x"".

Since we know N is in the word, if I place N at a wrong position, I will get ""-"", which doesn't give new information; it just confirms it's wrong, which we infer.

Specifically, if I deliberately place N at position 4, which we know is wrong, I will get ""-"" meaning it's still wrong position, but we already know that, so it doesn't help. Similarly, placing E at position 5 will get ""-"" meaning wrong position, which we know.

Therefore, it's inefficient; better to place at new positions to possibly get ""correct"" or new info.

So, in the guess, avoid placing R at position 2, N at position 4, E at position 5.

In fact, avoid those specific positions for those letters.

In the new guess, for letters we know are present but position wrong, do not place them in positions they were before if possible; place them where they could be correct.

Here, I need to place R not at 2, N not at 4, E not at 5.

So, for R: possible positions 1,3,4,5

N: 1,2,3,5

E: 1,2,3,4

Therefore, when forming a word, I should assign positions accordingly.

In ""miner"": M at1, I at2, N at3, E at4, R at5

So R at position 5: which is allowed since previously at 2, not here.

N at position 3: allowed, not position 4.

E at position 4: allowed, not position 5.

Also, position 4 for E: previously E was at position 5, now position 4 might be correct.

Similarly.

In ""reign"": R at1, E at2, I at3, G at4, N at5

E at position 2: not 5, ok.

N at position 5: not 4, ok.

R at position 1: not 2, ok.

Both are good.

I'll choose ""miner"" since ""miner"" has common consonants.

Another option: ""point"" no, must have E? No, but E is in word, so better include.

To be efficient.

I'll go with ""miner"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":

- C and A are not in the secret word (both marked ""x"").
- R, N, and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions:
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - N cannot be in position 4.
  - E cannot be in position 5.
- Therefore, the secret word contains R, N, and E elsewhere, along with two unknown letters.

For this second guess:
- We need to place R, N, and E in new possible positions to narrow down their locations:
  - R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
  - N can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
  - E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- We should avoid using C or A, as they are confirmed not in the word.
- The guess should introduce new, common letters to test for their presence and positions.
- ""miner"" is a valid 5-letter word that includes R, N, and E in repositioned locations:
  - R is at position 5 (new position, avoiding position 2).
  - N is at position 3 (new position, avoiding position 4).
  - E is at position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).
- It introduces M and I, two new vowels/consonants that are common and haven't been tested yet.
- This guess efficiently reuses known present letters while exploring new positions and letters.

The word was ""crane"", and the feedback is:\n\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- E: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\nSo, from this:\n\n- Letters C and A are not in the secret word.\n- R is in the word but not in the first position (since it was guessed there).\n- N is in the word but not in the fourth position.\n- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.\n\nAlso, since R, N, and E are all present, they must be somewhere else in the word.\n\nNow, the secret word is a 5-letter word containing R, N, and E, but not C or A.\n\nWe need to make a new guess that incorporates this information.\n\nAvailable letters: R, N, E must be included, but in different positions since their current positions are wrong.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- R is not in position 1 (we guessed it there).\n- N is not in position 4.\n- E is not in position 5.\n\nAlso, we need to choose positions where R, N, E can be placed.\n\nMoreover, since C and A are out, we should avoid using them in the new guess.\n\nThe word must consist of letters including R, N, E, and two other letters that are not C or A. But we don\'t know what those are yet.\n\nPossible letters: Since common letters, we might consider other vowels or consonants.\n\nBut E is already in the word; it\'s a vowel, so there might be other vowels.\n\nThe secret word has R, N, E, so it must contain these three, and two more letters.\n\nWe need to guess a word that includes R, N, E in positions different from the first guess.\n\nIn ""crane"":\n\nPositions:\n1: C (x)\n2: R (-)\n3: A (x)\n4: N (-)\n5: E (-)\n\nSo:\n- Position 1: not C\n- Position 2: not R, but R is in the word\n- Position 3: not A\n- Position 4: not N\n- Position 5: not E\n\nR must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5 but not 2. Positions available: 1,3,4,5 since it can\'t be in 2.\n\nSimilarly, N cannot be in 4, so it must be in 1,2,3, or 5.\n\nE cannot be in 5, so it must be in 1,2,3, or 4.\n\nAlso, positions 1 and 3 are now open, since C and A are out.\n\nIn the new guess, I need to place R, N, E in different positions.\n\nMoreover, the word should be a valid English word.\n\nI could use a word that has R, N, E but rearranged.\n\nCommon words with R, N, E: for example, ""inner"" but that has N twice, and E, but E is not in position 5? Let\'s not assume.\n\nBetter to think of words without repeating letters if possible.\n\nSince we have feedback that R, N, E are present, we want to reposition them.\n\nAlso, we need to include two new letters that might be in the word or not.\n\nA strategic guess would be to place R, N, E in possible positions and introduce new letters.\n\nLet me brainstorm some words that contain R, N, E, but not C or A.\n\nFor example:\n\n- ""liner"": but L is another letter, and E is at the end. In ""crane"", E is at position 5, but feedback shows E is wrong position, so in secret word, E is not at position 5, but could be elsewhere. In ""liner"", if E is at position 5, but secret E not at 5, so not suitable.\n\nIf I guess ""liner"", and E is at 5, but if secret has E not at 5, that might not be good, but in this case, since E must be elsewhere, guessing a word with E at 5 would give feedback, but it might be inefficient if E is fixed elsewhere.\n\nI should avoid placing E at position 5 again, similarly for others.\n\nLet me consider possible positions:\n\nFrom feedback:\n\n- R cannot be at position 2. Possible positions for R: 1,3,4,5\n\n- N cannot be at position 4. Possible: 1,2,3,5\n\n- E cannot be at position 5. Possible: 1,2,3,4\n\nAlso, since R, N, E are all in the word, and word has two more letters.\n\nNow, for the new guess, I need to choose positions for R,N,E and two other letters.\n\nI should choose common letters not yet tried. C and A are out, so avoid them.\n\nLetters not tried: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nVowels: I,O,U are possible; consonants: many.\n\nSince E is already a vowel, perhaps others are consonants.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nTo maximize information, a good approach is to include letters that are common and not yet tested.\n\nBut in this case, we already know R,N,E are present, so I should focus on finding their positions and testing new letters.\n\nStandard advice in Wordle is to reuse the present letters but in new positions to find their locations.\n\nSo, for the second guess, I should create a word that includes R,N,E, but in positions different from before.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- R not at 2\n\n- N not at 4\n\n- E not at 5\n\nAnd introduce new letters.\n\nLet me think of words with R,N,E.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""rinse"": positions: R at 1, I at 2, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5. But E is at position 5, which is forbidden because from feedback, E cannot be at position 5. So guessing ""rinse"" would have E at position 5, which we know is wrong, so it\'s inefficient; we might waste that position.\n\nSimilarly, if I guess E at 5, I know it will be wrong, so better to place E elsewhere.\n\nFor example:\n- ""reign"": R at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5. Now, positions: R at position 1 (was not position 1 before, but no feedback against position 1 yet), E at position 2 (previously not tested there), N at position 5 (previously not position 4, but position 5 is new).\n\nIn ""crane"", we only know that R is not at 2, N not at 4, E not at 5. Position 1 could have R or something else.\n\nIn ""reign"":\n- Position 1: R\n- Position 2: E\n- Position 3: I (new)\n- Position 4: G (new)\n- Position 5: N\n\nN at position 5: previously, N was at position 4 and wrong, so position 5 could be possible for N.\n\nE at position 2: previously E was at position 5 and wrong, so position 2 could be possible.\n\nSimilarly, R at position 1: previously R was at position 2 and wrong, so position 1 could be correct or wrong position.\n\nThis seems reasonable.\n\nAnother word: ""nerve"" but has E twice and R repeat, might not be ideal.\n\n""hinge"" – has H,I,N,G,E – position 5 is E, but E cannot be at 5, so avoid.\n\n""miner"" – M,I,N,E,R – positions: M at 1, I at 2, N at 3, E at 4, R at 5. N at position 3, E at position 4 (not 5), R at position 5. Possible.\n\nLet\'s list:\n\n- ""reign"" : R at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5\n\n- ""inter"" : I at 1, N at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5. E at position 4.\n\n- ""inert"" : similar to inter but with T, I,N,E,R,T? ""inert"" is I,N,E,R,T positions: I at1, N at2, E at3, R at4, T at5. But N at position 2? Previously N was not at position 4, but position 2 could be possible.\n\nPossible candidates:\n\n- ""reign"" : R,E,I,G,N — with E at position 2 and N at position 5.\n\n""reign"" might not be the most common word, but it\'s valid.\n\n- ""mince"" — but C is out! C is not in word, avoid C.\n\nC is confirmed not in word, so don\'t use C.\n\nSimilarly, A not in word.\n\nSo, letters to avoid: C, A.\n\n""miner"" : M,I,N,E,R — no C or A.\n\nPositions: M at1, I at2, N at3, E at4, R at5.\n\nThen:\n- Position 1: M new\n- Position 2: I new\n- Position 3: N — previously N was at position 4 and wrong; position 3 is new for N\n- Position 4: E — previously E was at position 5 and wrong; position 4 is new for E\n- Position 5: R — previously R was at position 2 and wrong; position 5 is new for R\n\nAll positions for R,N,E are new, and we introduce M and I.\n\nThis seems good.\n\nAnother one: ""liner"" : L,I,N,E,R — N at3, E at4, R at5 — E at position 4, not 5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut ""liner"" has L and I new.\n\n""miner"" might be better because of common letters.\n\nPerhaps ""point"" but no E? But we must include E because it\'s in the word. No, we know E is in the word, so the guess must include E to gather more position info, but we can choose not to include it if we want to test other letters, but since we know it\'s in, better to include it to pin its position.\n\nStandard strategy is to include confirmed letters in new positions.\n\nSimilarly for R and N.\n\nSo yes.\n\nOther words: ""bakes"" but A is invalid, and K,S new, but no R or N? Must include R,N,E? Not necessarily, but if I don\'t include them, I might not get position info.\n\nFor example, I could guess a word with entirely new letters to test new ones, leaving R,N,E positions unknown later.\n\nBut that might be less efficient because I have three known letters.\n\nTypically, it\'s better to reposition the known present letters.\n\nSo I think ""miner"" is a good choice.\n\n"" reign"" and ""miner"", both fine.\n\n""inter"" : I,N,T,E,R — positions: I at1, N at2, T at3, E at4, R at5\n\nN at position 2: possible, no feedback against position 2 for N.\n\nSimilarly E at4, R at5.\n\nIntroducing I and T.\n\nI is a common vowel.\n\nLet\'s decide: I\'ll go with ""miner"" for now.\n\nBut ""miner"" has N at position 3 and E at position 4.\n\nIn the secret word, R must be placed: if not in position 2, and in this guess, if I have R at position 5, etc.\n\nAnother word: ""rouse"" — R,O,U,S,E — but E at position 5 again, which is invalid position for E, so avoid.\n\nSimilarly, ""serve"" E at end.\n\nAvoid any E at position 5.\n\nAlso, N not at position 4, so avoid placing N at position 4.\n\nIn my guess, I shouldn\'t place N at position 4 or E at position 5, because I know those are wrong.\n\nIn ""miner"", I placed N at position 3, E at position 4 — position 3 and 4 are both different from previous.\n\nPrevious: N was at position 4, now I place at position 3; E was at position 5, now at position 4; R was at position 2, now at position 5. All different positions.\n\nGood.\n\nSimilarly in ""inter"": N at position 2, E at 4, R at 5.\n\nPosition 2 for N: possible, since N was at position 4 before and wrong, but position 2 could be correct.\n\nNo restriction.\n\nI think ""miner"" is fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the word is valid. Yes.\n\nPerhaps I can consider ""shine"" but no R? ""shine"" has S,H,I,N,E — missing R.\n\nMust include R? Not necessarily, but if I guess ""shine"", I test S,H,I,N,E with N at position 4? Position 4: but N cannot be at position 4 from previous feedback? In ""crane"", N at position 4 was wrong, so if I guess ""shine"" with N at position 4, it will be wrong, wasted opportunity.\n\nIn ""shine"": positions: S at1, H at2, I at3, N at4, E at5\n\nN at position 4: we know from feedback that position 4 is not N, so guessing N at position 4 will definitely get ""x"" or ""-"" but since we know it\'s wrong position, if it\'s ""-"" it means N is in word but not here, which we know, or ""x"" meaning not, but we know N is in word, so if I place N at position 4, I get ""-"" meaning wrong position, which we already know, or if it mistakenly ""x"" but since N is in word, it should be ""-"" . Feedback symbol: if letter in word but wrong position, ""-""; if not in word, ""x"".\n\nSince we know N is in the word, if I place N at a wrong position, I will get ""-"", which doesn\'t give new information; it just confirms it\'s wrong, which we infer.\n\nSpecifically, if I deliberately place N at position 4, which we know is wrong, I will get ""-"" meaning it\'s still wrong position, but we already know that, so it doesn\'t help. Similarly, placing E at position 5 will get ""-"" meaning wrong position, which we know.\n\nTherefore, it\'s inefficient; better to place at new positions to possibly get ""correct"" or new info.\n\nSo, in the guess, avoid placing R at position 2, N at position 4, E at position 5.\n\nIn fact, avoid those specific positions for those letters.\n\nIn the new guess, for letters we know are present but position wrong, do not place them in positions they were before if possible; place them where they could be correct.\n\nHere, I need to place R not at 2, N not at 4, E not at 5.\n\nSo, for R: possible positions 1,3,4,5\n\nN: 1,2,3,5\n\nE: 1,2,3,4\n\nTherefore, when forming a word, I should assign positions accordingly.\n\nIn ""miner"": M at1, I at2, N at3, E at4, R at5\n\nSo R at position 5: which is allowed since previously at 2, not here.\n\nN at position 3: allowed, not position 4.\n\nE at position 4: allowed, not position 5.\n\nAlso, position 4 for E: previously E was at position 5, now position 4 might be correct.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn ""reign"": R at1, E at2, I at3, G at4, N at5\n\nE at position 2: not 5, ok.\n\nN at position 5: not 4, ok.\n\nR at position 1: not 2, ok.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nI\'ll choose ""miner"" since ""miner"" has common consonants.\n\nAnother option: ""point"" no, must have E? No, but E is in word, so better include.\n\nTo be efficient.\n\nI\'ll go with ""miner"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n\n- C and A are not in the secret word (both marked ""x"").\n- R, N, and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions:\n  - R cannot be in position 2.\n  - N cannot be in position 4.\n  - E cannot be in position 5.\n- Therefore, the secret word contains R, N, and E elsewhere, along with two unknown letters.\n\nFor this second guess:\n- We need to place R, N, and E in new possible positions to narrow down their locations:\n  - R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n  - N can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n  - E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n- We should avoid using C or A, as they are confirmed not in the word.\n- The guess should introduce new, common letters to test for their presence and positions.\n- ""miner"" is a valid 5-letter word that includes R, N, and E in repositioned locations:\n  - R is at position 5 (new position, avoiding position 2).\n  - N is at position 3 (new position, avoiding position 4).\n  - E is at position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).\n- It introduces M and I, two new vowels/consonants that are common and haven\'t been tested yet.\n- This guess efficiently reuses known present letters while exploring new positions and letters.\n\n<guess>miner</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: miner -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(-) E(-) R(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning:
- C and A are not in the word.
- R, N, E are in the word but not in positions 2, 4, and 5 respectively.

Guess 2: ""miner"" -> M(x) I(x) N(-) E(-) R(-)
Meaning:
- M and I are not in the word.
- N, E, R are in the word but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively.

Now, combining the information:

Letters not in the word: C, A, M, I
Letters in the word: R, N, E (from both guesses)

From Guess 1:
- R is not in position 2.
- N is not in position 4.
- E is not in position 5.

From Guess 2:
- N is not in position 3 (since N(-) at position 3).
- E is not in position 4 (since E(-) at position 4).
- R is not in position 5 (since R(-) at position 5).

Also, since R, N, E are all present, and we have two more letters to find.

Now, let's list possible positions for each:

For R:
- Cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 1) and position 5 (from Guess 2).
- So possible positions: 1, 3, 4.

For N:
- Cannot be in position 4 (from Guess 1) and position 3 (from Guess 2).
- So possible positions: 1, 2, 5.

For E:
- Cannot be in position 5 (from Guess 1) and position 4 (from Guess 2).
- So possible positions: 1, 2, 3.

We also know the word has 5 letters, so positions 1,2,3,4,5.

Now, we need to make a new guess that includes R, N, E in the possible positions and introduces two new letters (since C,A,M,I are out, and we need to test other letters).

Letters not used yet: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common letters: S, T, L, O, U, etc.

We should form a word that places R, N, E in their possible positions and uses two new common letters.

Let's think of words that have R, N, E and two other letters from the unused set.

Possible words:

- We need to place R in 1,3, or 4; N in 1,2, or 5; E in 1,2, or 3.

But note: positions must be distinct.

For example, if we place E at position 1, then N cannot be at 1, etc.

Let's consider the constraints.

Also, from the feedback, we have:

In Guess 2, N was at position 3 and got ""-"", meaning N is not at 3, but we already have that.

Similarly, E at position 4 got ""-"", not at 4.

R at position 5 got ""-"", not at 5.

Now, for the third guess, we should try to cover as many possibilities as possible.

One idea is to place E at position 1, since it can be there.

Similarly, R at position 3 or 4, N at position 2 or 5.

For example:

- Position 1: E (possible for E)
- Position 2: N (possible for N)
- Then position 3: R (possible for R)
- Then positions 4 and 5: new letters.

But is ""ENR.."" a common start? Not really.

""entry"" but T and Y, and E at1, N at2, T at3, R at4, Y at5. But R at position 4 is possible, and E at1, N at2.

But ""entry"" has Y, which is less common.

Another word: ""endow"" but O and W, and E at1, N at2, D at3, O at4, W at5. But we need to include R? We don't have to include R in this guess, but since R is in the word, if we don't include it, we might not get position info. But we can choose to test other letters.

However, it might be better to include the known letters to find their positions.

Since we have three known letters, we should include them to narrow down.

Another word: ""nerdy"" but D and Y, E at position 1? ""nerdy"" is N,E,R,D,Y — positions: N at1, E at2, R at3, D at4, Y at5.

Now, check positions:

- N at position 1: possible (from N possible positions: 1,2,5)
- E at position 2: possible (E can be 1,2,3)
- R at position 3: possible (R can be 1,3,4)

But in this case, N is at position 1, which is new; E at position 2, new; R at position 3, new.

Also, introduces D and Y.

But Y is less common; maybe not ideal.

Another word: ""hover"" but no N? Missing N.

We need to include N? Not necessarily, but if we don't, we won't get info on N's position.

Similarly for R and E.

But we can focus on one or two, but with three, it's tricky.

Perhaps we can use a word that has R and E, and test N separately, but let's see.

Since N can be at 1,2,5, and E at 1,2,3, they conflict at positions 1 and 2.

For example, if I place E at 1, N cannot be at 1, so N must be at 2 or 5.

Similarly, if E at 2, N cannot be at 2, so N at 1 or 5.

If E at 3, N can be at 1,2,5.

Similarly for R.

Let's list possible words with R,N,E.

For example, ""owner"": O,W,N,E,R — positions: O at1, W at2, N at3, E at4, R at5.

But E at position 4: but E cannot be at position 4 from Guess 2 feedback (E(-) at position 4). So E not at 4, so ""owner"" has E at 4, which is invalid, so avoid.

Similarly, ""under"": U,N,D,E,R — positions: U at1, N at2, D at3, E at4, R at5.

E at position 4: again, not allowed, since E not at 4.

""enter"": E,N,T,E,R — but E repeated, and positions: E at1, N at2, T at3, E at4 — E at position 4 not allowed, and also duplicate E, which might not be good if we don't know about duplicates.

But we don't know if there are duplicates, so better to avoid repeated letters for now.

""inner"" has duplicate N.

So avoid repeats.

""liner"" but L and I, but I is already out (from Guess 2, I(x)), so I not in word, cannot use I.

Letters out: C, A, M, I.

So cannot use I.

Similarly, ""honer"": H,O,N,E,R — positions: H at1, O at2, N at3, E at4, R at5.

E at position 4: not allowed.

""risen"": R,I,S,E,N — but I is out, cannot use I.

""stone"": S,T,O,N,E — positions: S at1, T at2, O at3, N at4, E at5.

But N at position 4: from Guess 1, N not at position 4, so cannot place N at 4.

Also, E at position 5: not allowed.

So not good.

""tuned"": T,U,N,E,D — positions: T at1, U at2, N at3, E at4, D at5.

E at position 4: not allowed.

""robed"": but E not in, and B,D, but we need E? ""robed"" has E? R,O,B,E,D — E at position 4, not allowed.

It's hard to find a word with E not at 4 or 5.

E can be at 1,2,3.

Similarly, N not at 3 or 4, so at 1,2,5.

R not at 2 or 5, so at 1,3,4.

So let's try to place E at position 1.

Then word starts with E.

Then N can be at position 2 or 5.

R can be at position 3 or 4.

For example, E at 1, N at 2, then R at 3 or 4.

If R at 3, then positions 4 and 5 new letters.

Word: e n r ? ?

Like ""enrol"" but O and L, positions: E1, N2, R3, O4, L5.

Now, check: E at1: good, N at2: possible (N can be at2), R at3: possible (R can be at3), O and L new.

But N at position 2: is that allowed? From constraints, N can be at 1,2,5, so position 2 is fine.

Similarly, R at position 3 is fine.

E at position 1 is fine.

""enrol"" is a word? Or ""enroll"" is 6 letters. ""entry"" we had, but Y.

""endow"" no R.

Another: ""enjoy"" but J and Y, and O? E,N,J,O,Y — no R.

We need R in the word? Not necessarily for the guess, but since R is in the secret, if we don't include it, we won't get feedback on its position.

Similarly for N and E.

But in this case, for ""enrol"", we include E and N, but not R. R is missing.

""enrol"" has E,N,R,O,L — R is at position 3.

""enrol"" is E,N,R,O,L — yes, R at 3.

L at 5.

O at 4.

So it includes R.

""enrol"" is a valid word.

But let's confirm: positions: 1:E, 2:N, 3:R, 4:O, 5:L

Now, for N: at position 2. From constraints, N can be at 1,2,5, so 2 is possible.

E at 1: possible.

R at 3: possible.

O and L new.

Also, O is a vowel, common.

But we have E already, so O might be another vowel or not.

Another word: ""ebony"" but B,O,N,E,Y — N at position 4? ""ebony"" is E,B,O,N,Y — positions: E1,B2,O3,N4,Y5.

N at position 4: but N cannot be at position 4 from Guess 1, so invalid placement.

Not good.

""ounce"" but C out, and U,N,C,E — C not in word.

C is out.

""angel"" but A out.

So ""enrol"" seems reasonable.

But ""enrol"" might be less common; perhaps ""enter"" but E at4 not allowed and duplicate? ""enter"" has two E's.

""onset"" O,N,S,E,T — positions: O1,N2,S3,E4,T5.

E at position 4: not allowed.

""inert"" but I out.

I is out.

""unset"" U,N,S,E,T — E at4 not allowed.

""outer"" O,U,T,E,R — positions: O1,U2,T3,E4,R5 — E at4 not allowed.

So back to ""enrol"".

Another possibility: place E at position 3.

E can be at 1,2,3.

If E at 3, then N can be at 1,2,5; R at 1,3,4 but position 3 is taken, so R at 1 or 4.

For example, word with E at 3: ? ? E ? ?

If R at 1, then R ? E ? ?

Then N at 2 or 5.

If N at 2: R N E ? ?

Like ""rune s"" but not a word. ""runes"" is 5 letters: R,U,N,E,S — positions: R1,U2,N3,E4,S5.

But E at position 4: not allowed.

""rites"" no N.

""brent"" B,R,E,N,T — positions: B1,R2,E3,N4,T5.

N at position 4: not allowed.

""trend"" T,R,E,N,D — positions: T1,R2,E3,N4,D5 — N at4 not allowed.

""spree"" duplicate E.

Hard to find.

Place N at position 1.

N at1 possible.

Then E at 1,2,3 but position 1 taken, so E at 2 or 3.

R at 1,3,4 but position 1 taken, so R at 3 or 4.

For example, N at1, E at2, R at3: N E R ? ?

Like ""nerdy"" but D and Y, and E at2, R at3.

""nerdy"": N1,E2,R3,D4,Y5.

Now, E at2: possible, R at3: possible.

But D and Y.

""nerve"" duplicate E.

""north"" no E.

""nurse"" N,U,R,S,E — positions: N1,U2,R3,S4,E5.

E at position 5: not allowed.

""noble"" no R.

So not easy.

Place N at position 5.

N at5 possible.

Then E at 1,2,3.

R at 1,3,4.

For example, E at1, R at3, N at5: E ? R ? N

Like ""earth"" but A out, and T,H.

""epoch"" no R.

""eerie"" duplicate E.

""deter"" D,E,T,E,R duplicate.

""ember"" E,M,B,E,R duplicate and M out.

M is out.

""offer"" no N.

So perhaps ""enrol"" is a decent choice.

Another word: ""rowel"" but no N or E.

We need to include E and N and R.

""renew"" duplicate E.

""renal"" R,E,N,A,L — but A out.

A not in word.

""tenor"" T,E,N,O,R — positions: T1,E2,N3,O4,R5.

Now, E at position 2: possible (E can be at 2)

N at position 3: but from Guess 2, N was at position 3 and got ""-"", meaning N is not at position 3. So N cannot be at position 3.

In ""tenor"", N is at position 3, which is forbidden, so we know it will be wrong, so not good to guess.

Similarly, in any guess, we should not place N at position 3 because we know it's not there.

Similarly, not E at position 4 or 5, not R at position 2 or 5.

So for N, cannot be at 3 or 4, so only positions 1,2,5.

For E, cannot be at 4 or 5, so only 1,2,3.

For R, cannot be at 2 or 5, so only 1,3,4.

Now, in ""tenor"", N at 3 is invalid, so avoid.

Similarly, back to ""enrol"": E at1, N at2, R at3, O at4, L at5.

N at position 2: allowed (since N can be at 1,2,5)

R at position 3: allowed (R can be at 1,3,4)

E at position 1: allowed.

And positions are all new for the letters.

So I think it's a good guess.

Perhaps ""ebbed"" but duplicate and B, E at1, B2,B3,E4,D5 — E at4 not allowed.

Not good.

""adobe"" A out.

So I'll go with ""enrol"".

But ""enrol"" might be spelled with one L, and it's valid.

To use more common letters, but O and L are common.

Another word: ""stone"" but N at4 and E at5 not allowed.

""shone"" same issue.

""alone"" A out.

""prone"" P,R,O,N,E — positions: P1,R2,O3,N4,E5.

R at position 2: but R cannot be at position 2 from Guess 1, so invalid.

N at4 invalid, E at5 invalid.

Not good.

""crony"" C out.

So ""enrol"" seems fine.

Perhaps ""grown"" no E.

I think we should use ""enrol"".

But let's confirm the feedback.

In Guess 2, we have N at position 3 got ""-"", so N not at 3.

In ""enrol"", N is at position 2, which is different.

Similarly.

Another option: ""rouen"" R,O,U,E,N — positions: R1,O2,U3,E4,N5.

But E at position 4: not allowed, and N at position 5: possible, but E at4 invalid.

Not good.

""urine"" U,R,I,N,E — but I out.

I not in word.

""drone"" D,R,O,N,E — positions: D1,R2,O3,N4,E5.

R at2 invalid, N at4 invalid, E at5 invalid.

Not good.

So I think ""enrol"" is a reasonable choice.

<guess>enrol</guess>

But let's spell it: E-N-R-O-L.

Yes.

Perhaps ""enrol"" is not very common; ""renal"" but A out.

""tenet"" duplicate.

I think it's ok.

So for the third guess, I'll go with ""enrol"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)**  
  This means:  
  - C and A are not in the secret word.  
  - R, N, and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions:  
    - R is not in position 2.  
    - N is not in position 4.  
    - E is not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: ""miner"" → Feedback: M(x) I(x) N(-) E(-) R(-)**  
  This means:  
  - M and I are not in the secret word.  
  - N, E, and R are in the secret word but in the wrong positions:  
    - N is not in position 3.  
    - E is not in position 4.  
    - R is not in position 5.  

### Combined Information:
- **Confirmed absent letters:** C, A, M, I (cannot be used).  
- **Confirmed present letters:** R, N, E (must be included in the guess).  
- **Position constraints:**  
  - R cannot be in positions 2 or 5. Possible positions: 1, 3, or 4.  
  - N cannot be in positions 3 or 4. Possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.  
  - E cannot be in positions 4 or 5. Possible positions: 1, 2, or 3.  
- The secret word has 5 letters, so we need to find two additional unknown letters (not C, A, M, I).  

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- Reuse the confirmed letters (R, N, E) in new positions that fit the constraints to narrow down their locations.  
- Introduce two new, common letters to test for their presence and positions.  
- Avoid positions that are already ruled out for R, N, and E.  
- Choose a valid 5-letter word that maximizes information.  

### Chosen Guess: ""enrol""
- **Breakdown of ""enrol"":**  
  - Position 1: E (E is possible here, as E can be in position 1, 2, or 3).  
  - Position 2: N (N is possible here, as N can be in position 1, 2, or 5).  
  - Position 3: R (R is possible here, as R can be in position 1, 3, or 4).  
  - Position 4: O (new letter, not tested before).  
  - Position 5: L (new letter, not tested before).  
- **Why ""enrol""?**  
  - It places R, N, and E in positions that are all new and allowed based on feedback (e.g., E not in 4/5, N not in 3/4, R not in 2/5).  
  - It tests two new common letters (O and L) that could be part of the secret word.  
  - It is a valid English word (meaning: to enroll or register).  
- **Expected outcomes:**  
  - If E is correct in position 1, it will be marked ""✓"".  
  - If N is correct in position 2, it will be marked ""✓"".  
  - If R is correct in position 3, it will be marked ""✓"".  
  - O and L will provide new feedback (e.g., ""✓"" if correct, ""-"" if present but wrong position, or ""x"" if absent).  

This guess efficiently repositions the known letters while exploring new possibilities.

<guess>enrol</guess>",enrol,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning:
- C and A are not in the word.
- R, N, E are in the word but not in positions 2, 4, and 5 respectively.

Guess 2: ""miner"" -> M(x) I(x) N(-) E(-) R(-)
Meaning:
- M and I are not in the word.
- N, E, R are in the word but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively.

Now, combining the information:

Letters not in the word: C, A, M, I
Letters in the word: R, N, E (from both guesses)

From Guess 1:
- R is not in position 2.
- N is not in position 4.
- E is not in position 5.

From Guess 2:
- N is not in position 3 (since N(-) at position 3).
- E is not in position 4 (since E(-) at position 4).
- R is not in position 5 (since R(-) at position 5).

Also, since R, N, E are all present, and we have two more letters to find.

Now, let's list possible positions for each:

For R:
- Cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 1) and position 5 (from Guess 2).
- So possible positions: 1, 3, 4.

For N:
- Cannot be in position 4 (from Guess 1) and position 3 (from Guess 2).
- So possible positions: 1, 2, 5.

For E:
- Cannot be in position 5 (from Guess 1) and position 4 (from Guess 2).
- So possible positions: 1, 2, 3.

We also know the word has 5 letters, so positions 1,2,3,4,5.

Now, we need to make a new guess that includes R, N, E in the possible positions and introduces two new letters (since C,A,M,I are out, and we need to test other letters).

Letters not used yet: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common letters: S, T, L, O, U, etc.

We should form a word that places R, N, E in their possible positions and uses two new common letters.

Let's think of words that have R, N, E and two other letters from the unused set.

Possible words:

- We need to place R in 1,3, or 4; N in 1,2, or 5; E in 1,2, or 3.

But note: positions must be distinct.

For example, if we place E at position 1, then N cannot be at 1, etc.

Let's consider the constraints.

Also, from the feedback, we have:

In Guess 2, N was at position 3 and got ""-"", meaning N is not at 3, but we already have that.

Similarly, E at position 4 got ""-"", not at 4.

R at position 5 got ""-"", not at 5.

Now, for the third guess, we should try to cover as many possibilities as possible.

One idea is to place E at position 1, since it can be there.

Similarly, R at position 3 or 4, N at position 2 or 5.

For example:

- Position 1: E (possible for E)
- Position 2: N (possible for N)
- Then position 3: R (possible for R)
- Then positions 4 and 5: new letters.

But is ""ENR.."" a common start? Not really.

""entry"" but T and Y, and E at1, N at2, T at3, R at4, Y at5. But R at position 4 is possible, and E at1, N at2.

But ""entry"" has Y, which is less common.

Another word: ""endow"" but O and W, and E at1, N at2, D at3, O at4, W at5. But we need to include R? We don't have to include R in this guess, but since R is in the word, if we don't include it, we might not get position info. But we can choose to test other letters.

However, it might be better to include the known letters to find their positions.

Since we have three known letters, we should include them to narrow down.

Another word: ""nerdy"" but D and Y, E at position 1? ""nerdy"" is N,E,R,D,Y — positions: N at1, E at2, R at3, D at4, Y at5.

Now, check positions:

- N at position 1: possible (from N possible positions: 1,2,5)
- E at position 2: possible (E can be 1,2,3)
- R at position 3: possible (R can be 1,3,4)

But in this case, N is at position 1, which is new; E at position 2, new; R at position 3, new.

Also, introduces D and Y.

But Y is less common; maybe not ideal.

Another word: ""hover"" but no N? Missing N.

We need to include N? Not necessarily, but if we don't, we won't get info on N's position.

Similarly for R and E.

But we can focus on one or two, but with three, it's tricky.

Perhaps we can use a word that has R and E, and test N separately, but let's see.

Since N can be at 1,2,5, and E at 1,2,3, they conflict at positions 1 and 2.

For example, if I place E at 1, N cannot be at 1, so N must be at 2 or 5.

Similarly, if E at 2, N cannot be at 2, so N at 1 or 5.

If E at 3, N can be at 1,2,5.

Similarly for R.

Let's list possible words with R,N,E.

For example, ""owner"": O,W,N,E,R — positions: O at1, W at2, N at3, E at4, R at5.

But E at position 4: but E cannot be at position 4 from Guess 2 feedback (E(-) at position 4). So E not at 4, so ""owner"" has E at 4, which is invalid, so avoid.

Similarly, ""under"": U,N,D,E,R — positions: U at1, N at2, D at3, E at4, R at5.

E at position 4: again, not allowed, since E not at 4.

""enter"": E,N,T,E,R — but E repeated, and positions: E at1, N at2, T at3, E at4 — E at position 4 not allowed, and also duplicate E, which might not be good if we don't know about duplicates.

But we don't know if there are duplicates, so better to avoid repeated letters for now.

""inner"" has duplicate N.

So avoid repeats.

""liner"" but L and I, but I is already out (from Guess 2, I(x)), so I not in word, cannot use I.

Letters out: C, A, M, I.

So cannot use I.

Similarly, ""honer"": H,O,N,E,R — positions: H at1, O at2, N at3, E at4, R at5.

E at position 4: not allowed.

""risen"": R,I,S,E,N — but I is out, cannot use I.

""stone"": S,T,O,N,E — positions: S at1, T at2, O at3, N at4, E at5.

But N at position 4: from Guess 1, N not at position 4, so cannot place N at 4.

Also, E at position 5: not allowed.

So not good.

""tuned"": T,U,N,E,D — positions: T at1, U at2, N at3, E at4, D at5.

E at position 4: not allowed.

""robed"": but E not in, and B,D, but we need E? ""robed"" has E? R,O,B,E,D — E at position 4, not allowed.

It's hard to find a word with E not at 4 or 5.

E can be at 1,2,3.

Similarly, N not at 3 or 4, so at 1,2,5.

R not at 2 or 5, so at 1,3,4.

So let's try to place E at position 1.

Then word starts with E.

Then N can be at position 2 or 5.

R can be at position 3 or 4.

For example, E at 1, N at 2, then R at 3 or 4.

If R at 3, then positions 4 and 5 new letters.

Word: e n r ? ?

Like ""enrol"" but O and L, positions: E1, N2, R3, O4, L5.

Now, check: E at1: good, N at2: possible (N can be at2), R at3: possible (R can be at3), O and L new.

But N at position 2: is that allowed? From constraints, N can be at 1,2,5, so position 2 is fine.

Similarly, R at position 3 is fine.

E at position 1 is fine.

""enrol"" is a word? Or ""enroll"" is 6 letters. ""entry"" we had, but Y.

""endow"" no R.

Another: ""enjoy"" but J and Y, and O? E,N,J,O,Y — no R.

We need R in the word? Not necessarily for the guess, but since R is in the secret, if we don't include it, we won't get feedback on its position.

Similarly for N and E.

But in this case, for ""enrol"", we include E and N, but not R. R is missing.

""enrol"" has E,N,R,O,L — R is at position 3.

""enrol"" is E,N,R,O,L — yes, R at 3.

L at 5.

O at 4.

So it includes R.

""enrol"" is a valid word.

But let's confirm: positions: 1:E, 2:N, 3:R, 4:O, 5:L

Now, for N: at position 2. From constraints, N can be at 1,2,5, so 2 is possible.

E at 1: possible.

R at 3: possible.

O and L new.

Also, O is a vowel, common.

But we have E already, so O might be another vowel or not.

Another word: ""ebony"" but B,O,N,E,Y — N at position 4? ""ebony"" is E,B,O,N,Y — positions: E1,B2,O3,N4,Y5.

N at position 4: but N cannot be at position 4 from Guess 1, so invalid placement.

Not good.

""ounce"" but C out, and U,N,C,E — C not in word.

C is out.

""angel"" but A out.

So ""enrol"" seems reasonable.

But ""enrol"" might be less common; perhaps ""enter"" but E at4 not allowed and duplicate? ""enter"" has two E's.

""onset"" O,N,S,E,T — positions: O1,N2,S3,E4,T5.

E at position 4: not allowed.

""inert"" but I out.

I is out.

""unset"" U,N,S,E,T — E at4 not allowed.

""outer"" O,U,T,E,R — positions: O1,U2,T3,E4,R5 — E at4 not allowed.

So back to ""enrol"".

Another possibility: place E at position 3.

E can be at 1,2,3.

If E at 3, then N can be at 1,2,5; R at 1,3,4 but position 3 is taken, so R at 1 or 4.

For example, word with E at 3: ? ? E ? ?

If R at 1, then R ? E ? ?

Then N at 2 or 5.

If N at 2: R N E ? ?

Like ""rune s"" but not a word. ""runes"" is 5 letters: R,U,N,E,S — positions: R1,U2,N3,E4,S5.

But E at position 4: not allowed.

""rites"" no N.

""brent"" B,R,E,N,T — positions: B1,R2,E3,N4,T5.

N at position 4: not allowed.

""trend"" T,R,E,N,D — positions: T1,R2,E3,N4,D5 — N at4 not allowed.

""spree"" duplicate E.

Hard to find.

Place N at position 1.

N at1 possible.

Then E at 1,2,3 but position 1 taken, so E at 2 or 3.

R at 1,3,4 but position 1 taken, so R at 3 or 4.

For example, N at1, E at2, R at3: N E R ? ?

Like ""nerdy"" but D and Y, and E at2, R at3.

""nerdy"": N1,E2,R3,D4,Y5.

Now, E at2: possible, R at3: possible.

But D and Y.

""nerve"" duplicate E.

""north"" no E.

""nurse"" N,U,R,S,E — positions: N1,U2,R3,S4,E5.

E at position 5: not allowed.

""noble"" no R.

So not easy.

Place N at position 5.

N at5 possible.

Then E at 1,2,3.

R at 1,3,4.

For example, E at1, R at3, N at5: E ? R ? N

Like ""earth"" but A out, and T,H.

""epoch"" no R.

""eerie"" duplicate E.

""deter"" D,E,T,E,R duplicate.

""ember"" E,M,B,E,R duplicate and M out.

M is out.

""offer"" no N.

So perhaps ""enrol"" is a decent choice.

Another word: ""rowel"" but no N or E.

We need to include E and N and R.

""renew"" duplicate E.

""renal"" R,E,N,A,L — but A out.

A not in word.

""tenor"" T,E,N,O,R — positions: T1,E2,N3,O4,R5.

Now, E at position 2: possible (E can be at 2)

N at position 3: but from Guess 2, N was at position 3 and got ""-"", meaning N is not at position 3. So N cannot be at position 3.

In ""tenor"", N is at position 3, which is forbidden, so we know it will be wrong, so not good to guess.

Similarly, in any guess, we should not place N at position 3 because we know it's not there.

Similarly, not E at position 4 or 5, not R at position 2 or 5.

So for N, cannot be at 3 or 4, so only positions 1,2,5.

For E, cannot be at 4 or 5, so only 1,2,3.

For R, cannot be at 2 or 5, so only 1,3,4.

Now, in ""tenor"", N at 3 is invalid, so avoid.

Similarly, back to ""enrol"": E at1, N at2, R at3, O at4, L at5.

N at position 2: allowed (since N can be at 1,2,5)

R at position 3: allowed (R can be at 1,3,4)

E at position 1: allowed.

And positions are all new for the letters.

So I think it's a good guess.

Perhaps ""ebbed"" but duplicate and B, E at1, B2,B3,E4,D5 — E at4 not allowed.

Not good.

""adobe"" A out.

So I'll go with ""enrol"".

But ""enrol"" might be spelled with one L, and it's valid.

To use more common letters, but O and L are common.

Another word: ""stone"" but N at4 and E at5 not allowed.

""shone"" same issue.

""alone"" A out.

""prone"" P,R,O,N,E — positions: P1,R2,O3,N4,E5.

R at position 2: but R cannot be at position 2 from Guess 1, so invalid.

N at4 invalid, E at5 invalid.

Not good.

""crony"" C out.

So ""enrol"" seems fine.

Perhaps ""grown"" no E.

I think we should use ""enrol"".

But let's confirm the feedback.

In Guess 2, we have N at position 3 got ""-"", so N not at 3.

In ""enrol"", N is at position 2, which is different.

Similarly.

Another option: ""rouen"" R,O,U,E,N — positions: R1,O2,U3,E4,N5.

But E at position 4: not allowed, and N at position 5: possible, but E at4 invalid.

Not good.

""urine"" U,R,I,N,E — but I out.

I not in word.

""drone"" D,R,O,N,E — positions: D1,R2,O3,N4,E5.

R at2 invalid, N at4 invalid, E at5 invalid.

Not good.

So I think ""enrol"" is a reasonable choice.

<guess>enrol</guess>

But let's spell it: E-N-R-O-L.

Yes.

Perhaps ""enrol"" is not very common; ""renal"" but A out.

""tenet"" duplicate.

I think it's ok.

So for the third guess, I'll go with ""enrol"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)**  
  This means:  
  - C and A are not in the secret word.  
  - R, N, and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions:  
    - R is not in position 2.  
    - N is not in position 4.  
    - E is not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: ""miner"" → Feedback: M(x) I(x) N(-) E(-) R(-)**  
  This means:  
  - M and I are not in the secret word.  
  - N, E, and R are in the secret word but in the wrong positions:  
    - N is not in position 3.  
    - E is not in position 4.  
    - R is not in position 5.  

### Combined Information:
- **Confirmed absent letters:** C, A, M, I (cannot be used).  
- **Confirmed present letters:** R, N, E (must be included in the guess).  
- **Position constraints:**  
  - R cannot be in positions 2 or 5. Possible positions: 1, 3, or 4.  
  - N cannot be in positions 3 or 4. Possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.

- Choose a valid 5-letter word that maximizes information.  

### Chosen Guess: ""enrol""
- **Breakdown of ""enrol"":**  
  - Position 1: E (E is possible here, as E can be in position 1, 2, or 3).  
  - Position 2: N (N is possible here, as N can be in position 1, 2, or 5).  
  - Position 3: R (R is possible here, as R can be in position 1, 3, or 4).  
  - Position 4: O (new letter, not tested before).  
  - Position 5: L (new letter, not tested before).  
- **Why ""enrol""?**  
  - It places R, N, and E in positions that are all new and allowed based on feedback (e.g., E not in 4/5, N not in 3/4, R not in 2/5).  
  - It tests two new common letters (O and L) that could be part of the secret word.  
  - It is a valid English word (meaning: to enroll or register).

  - O and L will provide new feedback (e.g., ""✓"" if correct, ""-"" if present but wrong position, or ""x"" if absent).

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and maximizes the information we get.
 Common vowels in English: A, E, I, O, U
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 A good starting word is one that has common letters and no repeating letters. 
 Some popular starting words are: CRANE, SLATE, AUDIO, STARE, ROATE, etc.

 I choose ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N). 
 It covers a good set of letters and is a valid 5-letter word.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>First, let's analyze the feedback from the first guess. The word was ""crane"", and the feedback is:

- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this:

- Letters C and A are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in the first position (since it was guessed there).
- N is in the word but not in the fourth position.
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

Also, since R, N, and E are all present, they must be somewhere else in the word.

Now, the secret word is a 5-letter word containing R, N, and E, but not C or A.

We need to make a new guess that incorporates this information.

Available letters: R, N, E must be included, but in different positions since their current positions are wrong.

Specifically:

- R is not in position 1 (we guessed it there).
- N is not in position 4.
- E is not in position 5.

Also, we need to choose positions where R, N, E can be placed.

Moreover, since C and A are out, we should avoid using them in the new guess.

The word must consist of letters including R, N, E, and two other letters that are not C or A. But we don't know what those are yet.

Possible letters: Since common letters, we might consider other vowels or consonants.

But E is already in the word; it's a vowel, so there might be other vowels.

The secret word has R, N, E, so it must contain these three, and two more letters.

We need to guess a word that includes R, N, E in positions different from the first guess.

In ""crane"":

Positions:
1: C (x)
2: R (-)
3: A (x)
4: N (-)
5: E (-)

So:
- Position 1: not C
- Position 2: not R, but R is in the word
- Position 3: not A
- Position 4: not N
- Position 5: not E

R must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5 but not 2. Positions available: 1,3,4,5 since it can't be in 2.

Similarly, N cannot be in 4, so it must be in 1,2,3, or 5.

E cannot be in 5, so it must be in 1,2,3, or 4.

Also, positions 1 and 3 are now open, since C and A are out.

In the new guess, I need to place R, N, E in different positions.

Moreover, the word should be a valid English word.

I could use a word that has R, N, E but rearranged.

Common words with R, N, E: for example, ""inner"" but that has N twice, and E, but E is not in position 5? Let's not assume.

Better to think of words without repeating letters if possible.

Since we have feedback that R, N, E are present, we want to reposition them.

Also, we need to include two new letters that might be in the word or not.

A strategic guess would be to place R, N, E in possible positions and introduce new letters.

Let me brainstorm some words that contain R, N, E, but not C or A.

For example:

- ""liner"": but L is another letter, and E is at the end. In ""crane"", E is at position 5, but feedback shows E is wrong position, so in secret word, E is not at position 5, but could be elsewhere. In ""liner"", if E is at position 5, but secret E not at 5, so not suitable.

If I guess ""liner"", and E is at 5, but if secret has E not at 5, that might not be good, but in this case, since E must be elsewhere, guessing a word with E at 5 would give feedback, but it might be inefficient if E is fixed elsewhere.

I should avoid placing E at position 5 again, similarly for others.

Let me consider possible positions:

From feedback:

- R cannot be at position 2. Possible positions for R: 1,3,4,5

- N cannot be at position 4. Possible: 1,2,3,5

- E cannot be at position 5. Possible: 1,2,3,4

Also, since R, N, E are all in the word, and word has two more letters.

Now, for the new guess, I need to choose positions for R,N,E and two other letters.

I should choose common letters not yet tried. C and A are out, so avoid them.

Letters not tried: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Vowels: I,O,U are possible; consonants: many.

Since E is already a vowel, perhaps others are consonants.

But we don't know.

To maximize information, a good approach is to include letters that are common and not yet tested.

But in this case, we already know R,N,E are present, so I should focus on finding their positions and testing new letters.

Standard advice in Wordle is to reuse the present letters but in new positions to find their locations.

So, for the second guess, I should create a word that includes R,N,E, but in positions different from before.

Specifically:

- R not at 2

- N not at 4

- E not at 5

And introduce new letters.

Let me think of words with R,N,E.

Possible words: 
- ""rinse"": positions: R at 1, I at 2, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5. But E is at position 5, which is forbidden because from feedback, E cannot be at position 5. So guessing ""rinse"" would have E at position 5, which we know is wrong, so it's inefficient; we might waste that position.

Similarly, if I guess E at 5, I know it will be wrong, so better to place E elsewhere.

For example:
- ""reign"": R at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5. Now, positions: R at position 1 (was not position 1 before, but no feedback against position 1 yet), E at position 2 (previously not tested there), N at position 5 (previously not position 4, but position 5 is new).

In ""crane"", we only know that R is not at 2, N not at 4, E not at 5. Position 1 could have R or something else.

In ""reign"":
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: I (new)
- Position 4: G (new)
- Position 5: N

N at position 5: previously, N was at position 4 and wrong, so position 5 could be possible for N.

E at position 2: previously E was at position 5 and wrong, so position 2 could be possible.

Similarly, R at position 1: previously R was at position 2 and wrong, so position 1 could be correct or wrong position.

This seems reasonable.

Another word: ""nerve"" but has E twice and R repeat, might not be ideal.

""hinge"" – has H,I,N,G,E – position 5 is E, but E cannot be at 5, so avoid.

""miner"" – M,I,N,E,R – positions: M at 1, I at 2, N at 3, E at 4, R at 5. N at position 3, E at position 4 (not 5), R at position 5. Possible.

Let's list:

- ""reign"" : R at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5

- ""inter"" : I at 1, N at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5. E at position 4.

- ""inert"" : similar to inter but with T, I,N,E,R,T? ""inert"" is I,N,E,R,T positions: I at1, N at2, E at3, R at4, T at5. But N at position 2? Previously N was not at position 4, but position 2 could be possible.

Possible candidates:

- ""reign"" : R,E,I,G,N — with E at position 2 and N at position 5.

""reign"" might not be the most common word, but it's valid.

- ""mince"" — but C is out! C is not in word, avoid C.

C is confirmed not in word, so don't use C.

Similarly, A not in word.

So, letters to avoid: C, A.

""miner"" : M,I,N,E,R — no C or A.

Positions: M at1, I at2, N at3, E at4, R at5.

Then:
- Position 1: M new
- Position 2: I new
- Position 3: N — previously N was at position 4 and wrong; position 3 is new for N
- Position 4: E — previously E was at position 5 and wrong; position 4 is new for E
- Position 5: R — previously R was at position 2 and wrong; position 5 is new for R

All positions for R,N,E are new, and we introduce M and I.

This seems good.

Another one: ""liner"" : L,I,N,E,R — N at3, E at4, R at5 — E at position 4, not 5.

Similarly.

But ""liner"" has L and I new.

""miner"" might be better because of common letters.

Perhaps ""point"" but no E? But we must include E because it's in the word. No, we know E is in the word, so the guess must include E to gather more position info, but we can choose not to include it if we want to test other letters, but since we know it's in, better to include it to pin its position.

Standard strategy is to include confirmed letters in new positions.

Similarly for R and N.

So yes.

Other words: ""bakes"" but A is invalid, and K,S new, but no R or N? Must include R,N,E? Not necessarily, but if I don't include them, I might not get position info.

For example, I could guess a word with entirely new letters to test new ones, leaving R,N,E positions unknown later.

But that might be less efficient because I have three known letters.

Typically, it's better to reposition the known present letters.

So I think ""miner"" is a good choice.

"" reign"" and ""miner"", both fine.

""inter"" : I,N,T,E,R — positions: I at1, N at2, T at3, E at4, R at5

N at position 2: possible, no feedback against position 2 for N.

Similarly E at4, R at5.

Introducing I and T.

I is a common vowel.

Let's decide: I'll go with ""miner"" for now.

But ""miner"" has N at position 3 and E at position 4.

In the secret word, R must be placed: if not in position 2, and in this guess, if I have R at position 5, etc.

Another word: ""rouse"" — R,O,U,S,E — but E at position 5 again, which is invalid position for E, so avoid.

Similarly, ""serve"" E at end.

Avoid any E at position 5.

Also, N not at position 4, so avoid placing N at position 4.

In my guess, I shouldn't place N at position 4 or E at position 5, because I know those are wrong.

In ""miner"", I placed N at position 3, E at position 4 — position 3 and 4 are both different from previous.

Previous: N was at position 4, now I place at position 3; E was at position 5, now at position 4; R was at position 2, now at position 5. All different positions.

Good.

Similarly in ""inter"": N at position 2, E at 4, R at 5.

Position 2 for N: possible, since N was at position 4 before and wrong, but position 2 could be correct.

No restriction.

I think ""miner"" is fine.

But let me confirm the word is valid. Yes.

Perhaps I can consider ""shine"" but no R? ""shine"" has S,H,I,N,E — missing R.

Must include R? Not necessarily, but if I guess ""shine"", I test S,H,I,N,E with N at position 4? Position 4: but N cannot be at position 4 from previous feedback? In ""crane"", N at position 4 was wrong, so if I guess ""shine"" with N at position 4, it will be wrong, wasted opportunity.

In ""shine"": positions: S at1, H at2, I at3, N at4, E at5

N at position 4: we know from feedback that position 4 is not N, so guessing N at position 4 will definitely get ""x"" or ""-"" but since we know it's wrong position, if it's ""-"" it means N is in word but not here, which we know, or ""x"" meaning not, but we know N is in word, so if I place N at position 4, I get ""-"" meaning wrong position, which we already know, or if it mistakenly ""x"" but since N is in word, it should be ""-"" . Feedback symbol: if letter in word but wrong position, ""-""; if not in word, ""x"".

Since we know N is in the word, if I place N at a wrong position, I will get ""-"", which doesn't give new information; it just confirms it's wrong, which we infer.

Specifically, if I deliberately place N at position 4, which we know is wrong, I will get ""-"" meaning it's still wrong position, but we already know that, so it doesn't help. Similarly, placing E at position 5 will get ""-"" meaning wrong position, which we know.

Therefore, it's inefficient; better to place at new positions to possibly get ""correct"" or new info.

So, in the guess, avoid placing R at position 2, N at position 4, E at position 5.

In fact, avoid those specific positions for those letters.

In the new guess, for letters we know are present but position wrong, do not place them in positions they were before if possible; place them where they could be correct.

Here, I need to place R not at 2, N not at 4, E not at 5.

So, for R: possible positions 1,3,4,5

N: 1,2,3,5

E: 1,2,3,4

Therefore, when forming a word, I should assign positions accordingly.

In ""miner"": M at1, I at2, N at3, E at4, R at5

So R at position 5: which is allowed since previously at 2, not here.

N at position 3: allowed, not position 4.

E at position 4: allowed, not position 5.

Also, position 4 for E: previously E was at position 5, now position 4 might be correct.

Similarly.

In ""reign"": R at1, E at2, I at3, G at4, N at5

E at position 2: not 5, ok.

N at position 5: not 4, ok.

R at position 1: not 2, ok.

Both are good.

I'll choose ""miner"" since ""miner"" has common consonants.

Another option: ""point"" no, must have E? No, but E is in word, so better include.

To be efficient.

I'll go with ""miner"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":

- C and A are not in the secret word (both marked ""x"").
- R, N, and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions:
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - N cannot be in position 4.
  - E cannot be in position 5.
- Therefore, the secret word contains R, N, and E elsewhere, along with two unknown letters.

For this second guess:
- We need to place R, N, and E in new possible positions to narrow down their locations:
  - R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
  - N can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
  - E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- We should avoid using C or A, as they are confirmed not in the word.
- The guess should introduce new, common letters to test for their presence and positions.
- ""miner"" is a valid 5-letter word that includes R, N, and E in repositioned locations:
  - R is at position 5 (new position, avoiding position 2).
  - N is at position 3 (new position, avoiding position 4).
  - E is at position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).
- It introduces M and I, two new vowels/consonants that are common and haven't been tested yet.
- This guess efficiently reuses known present letters while exploring new positions and letters.

<guess>miner</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: miner -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(-) E(-) R(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning:
- C and A are not in the word.
- R, N, E are in the word but not in positions 2, 4, and 5 respectively.

Guess 2: ""miner"" -> M(x) I(x) N(-) E(-) R(-)
Meaning:
- M and I are not in the word.
- N, E, R are in the word but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively.

Now, combining the information:

Letters not in the word: C, A, M, I
Letters in the word: R, N, E (from both guesses)

From Guess 1:
- R is not in position 2.
- N is not in position 4.
- E is not in position 5.

From Guess 2:
- N is not in position 3 (since N(-) at position 3).
- E is not in position 4 (since E(-) at position 4).
- R is not in position 5 (since R(-) at position 5).

Also, since R, N, E are all present, and we have two more letters to find.

Now, let's list possible positions for each:

For R:
- Cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 1) and position 5 (from Guess 2).
- So possible positions: 1, 3, 4.

For N:
- Cannot be in position 4 (from Guess 1) and position 3 (from Guess 2).
- So possible positions: 1, 2, 5.

For E:
- Cannot be in position 5 (from Guess 1) and position 4 (from Guess 2).
- So possible positions: 1, 2, 3.

We also know the word has 5 letters, so positions 1,2,3,4,5.

Now, we need to make a new guess that includes R, N, E in the possible positions and introduces two new letters (since C,A,M,I are out, and we need to test other letters).

Letters not used yet: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common letters: S, T, L, O, U, etc.

We should form a word that places R, N, E in their possible positions and uses two new common letters.

Let's think of words that have R, N, E and two other letters from the unused set.

Possible words:

- We need to place R in 1,3, or 4; N in 1,2, or 5; E in 1,2, or 3.

But note: positions must be distinct.

For example, if we place E at position 1, then N cannot be at 1, etc.

Let's consider the constraints.

Also, from the feedback, we have:

In Guess 2, N was at position 3 and got ""-"", meaning N is not at 3, but we already have that.

Similarly, E at position 4 got ""-"", not at 4.

R at position 5 got ""-"", not at 5.

Now, for the third guess, we should try to cover as many possibilities as possible.

One idea is to place E at position 1, since it can be there.

Similarly, R at position 3 or 4, N at position 2 or 5.

For example:

- Position 1: E (possible for E)
- Position 2: N (possible for N)
- Then position 3: R (possible for R)
- Then positions 4 and 5: new letters.

But is ""ENR.."" a common start? Not really.

""entry"" but T and Y, and E at1, N at2, T at3, R at4, Y at5. But R at position 4 is possible, and E at1, N at2.

But ""entry"" has Y, which is less common.

Another word: ""endow"" but O and W, and E at1, N at2, D at3, O at4, W at5. But we need to include R? We don't have to include R in this guess, but since R is in the word, if we don't include it, we might not get position info. But we can choose to test other letters.

However, it might be better to include the known letters to find their positions.

Since we have three known letters, we should include them to narrow down.

Another word: ""nerdy"" but D and Y, E at position 1? ""nerdy"" is N,E,R,D,Y — positions: N at1, E at2, R at3, D at4, Y at5.

Now, check positions:

- N at position 1: possible (from N possible positions: 1,2,5)
- E at position 2: possible (E can be 1,2,3)
- R at position 3: possible (R can be 1,3,4)

But in this case, N is at position 1, which is new; E at position 2, new; R at position 3, new.

Also, introduces D and Y.

But Y is less common; maybe not ideal.

Another word: ""hover"" but no N? Missing N.

We need to include N? Not necessarily, but if we don't, we won't get info on N's position.

Similarly for R and E.

But we can focus on one or two, but with three, it's tricky.

Perhaps we can use a word that has R and E, and test N separately, but let's see.

Since N can be at 1,2,5, and E at 1,2,3, they conflict at positions 1 and 2.

For example, if I place E at 1, N cannot be at 1, so N must be at 2 or 5.

Similarly, if E at 2, N cannot be at 2, so N at 1 or 5.

If E at 3, N can be at 1,2,5.

Similarly for R.

Let's list possible words with R,N,E.

For example, ""owner"": O,W,N,E,R — positions: O at1, W at2, N at3, E at4, R at5.

But E at position 4: but E cannot be at position 4 from Guess 2 feedback (E(-) at position 4). So E not at 4, so ""owner"" has E at 4, which is invalid, so avoid.

Similarly, ""under"": U,N,D,E,R — positions: U at1, N at2, D at3, E at4, R at5.

E at position 4: again, not allowed, since E not at 4.

""enter"": E,N,T,E,R — but E repeated, and positions: E at1, N at2, T at3, E at4 — E at position 4 not allowed, and also duplicate E, which might not be good if we don't know about duplicates.

But we don't know if there are duplicates, so better to avoid repeated letters for now.

""inner"" has duplicate N.

So avoid repeats.

""liner"" but L and I, but I is already out (from Guess 2, I(x)), so I not in word, cannot use I.

Letters out: C, A, M, I.

So cannot use I.

Similarly, ""honer"": H,O,N,E,R — positions: H at1, O at2, N at3, E at4, R at5.

E at position 4: not allowed.

""risen"": R,I,S,E,N — but I is out, cannot use I.

""stone"": S,T,O,N,E — positions: S at1, T at2, O at3, N at4, E at5.

But N at position 4: from Guess 1, N not at position 4, so cannot place N at 4.

Also, E at position 5: not allowed.

So not good.

""tuned"": T,U,N,E,D — positions: T at1, U at2, N at3, E at4, D at5.

E at position 4: not allowed.

""robed"": but E not in, and B,D, but we need E? ""robed"" has E? R,O,B,E,D — E at position 4, not allowed.

It's hard to find a word with E not at 4 or 5.

E can be at 1,2,3.

Similarly, N not at 3 or 4, so at 1,2,5.

R not at 2 or 5, so at 1,3,4.

So let's try to place E at position 1.

Then word starts with E.

Then N can be at position 2 or 5.

R can be at position 3 or 4.

For example, E at 1, N at 2, then R at 3 or 4.

If R at 3, then positions 4 and 5 new letters.

Word: e n r ? ?

Like ""enrol"" but O and L, positions: E1, N2, R3, O4, L5.

Now, check: E at1: good, N at2: possible (N can be at2), R at3: possible (R can be at3), O and L new.

But N at position 2: is that allowed? From constraints, N can be at 1,2,5, so position 2 is fine.

Similarly, R at position 3 is fine.

E at position 1 is fine.

""enrol"" is a word? Or ""enroll"" is 6 letters. ""entry"" we had, but Y.

""endow"" no R.

Another: ""enjoy"" but J and Y, and O? E,N,J,O,Y — no R.

We need R in the word? Not necessarily for the guess, but since R is in the secret, if we don't include it, we won't get feedback on its position.

Similarly for N and E.

But in this case, for ""enrol"", we include E and N, but not R. R is missing.

""enrol"" has E,N,R,O,L — R is at position 3.

""enrol"" is E,N,R,O,L — yes, R at 3.

L at 5.

O at 4.

So it includes R.

""enrol"" is a valid word.

But let's confirm: positions: 1:E, 2:N, 3:R, 4:O, 5:L

Now, for N: at position 2. From constraints, N can be at 1,2,5, so 2 is possible.

E at 1: possible.

R at 3: possible.

O and L new.

Also, O is a vowel, common.

But we have E already, so O might be another vowel or not.

Another word: ""ebony"" but B,O,N,E,Y — N at position 4? ""ebony"" is E,B,O,N,Y — positions: E1,B2,O3,N4,Y5.

N at position 4: but N cannot be at position 4 from Guess 1, so invalid placement.

Not good.

""ounce"" but C out, and U,N,C,E — C not in word.

C is out.

""angel"" but A out.

So ""enrol"" seems reasonable.

But ""enrol"" might be less common; perhaps ""enter"" but E at4 not allowed and duplicate? ""enter"" has two E's.

""onset"" O,N,S,E,T — positions: O1,N2,S3,E4,T5.

E at position 4: not allowed.

""inert"" but I out.

I is out.

""unset"" U,N,S,E,T — E at4 not allowed.

""outer"" O,U,T,E,R — positions: O1,U2,T3,E4,R5 — E at4 not allowed.

So back to ""enrol"".

Another possibility: place E at position 3.

E can be at 1,2,3.

If E at 3, then N can be at 1,2,5; R at 1,3,4 but position 3 is taken, so R at 1 or 4.

For example, word with E at 3: ? ? E ? ?

If R at 1, then R ? E ? ?

Then N at 2 or 5.

If N at 2: R N E ? ?

Like ""rune s"" but not a word. ""runes"" is 5 letters: R,U,N,E,S — positions: R1,U2,N3,E4,S5.

But E at position 4: not allowed.

""rites"" no N.

""brent"" B,R,E,N,T — positions: B1,R2,E3,N4,T5.

N at position 4: not allowed.

""trend"" T,R,E,N,D — positions: T1,R2,E3,N4,D5 — N at4 not allowed.

""spree"" duplicate E.

Hard to find.

Place N at position 1.

N at1 possible.

Then E at 1,2,3 but position 1 taken, so E at 2 or 3.

R at 1,3,4 but position 1 taken, so R at 3 or 4.

For example, N at1, E at2, R at3: N E R ? ?

Like ""nerdy"" but D and Y, and E at2, R at3.

""nerdy"": N1,E2,R3,D4,Y5.

Now, E at2: possible, R at3: possible.

But D and Y.

""nerve"" duplicate E.

""north"" no E.

""nurse"" N,U,R,S,E — positions: N1,U2,R3,S4,E5.

E at position 5: not allowed.

""noble"" no R.

So not easy.

Place N at position 5.

N at5 possible.

Then E at 1,2,3.

R at 1,3,4.

For example, E at1, R at3, N at5: E ? R ? N

Like ""earth"" but A out, and T,H.

""epoch"" no R.

""eerie"" duplicate E.

""deter"" D,E,T,E,R duplicate.

""ember"" E,M,B,E,R duplicate and M out.

M is out.

""offer"" no N.

So perhaps ""enrol"" is a decent choice.

Another word: ""rowel"" but no N or E.

We need to include E and N and R.

""renew"" duplicate E.

""renal"" R,E,N,A,L — but A out.

A not in word.

""tenor"" T,E,N,O,R — positions: T1,E2,N3,O4,R5.

Now, E at position 2: possible (E can be at 2)

N at position 3: but from Guess 2, N was at position 3 and got ""-"", meaning N is not at position 3. So N cannot be at position 3.

In ""tenor"", N is at position 3, which is forbidden, so we know it will be wrong, so not good to guess.

Similarly, in any guess, we should not place N at position 3 because we know it's not there.

Similarly, not E at position 4 or 5, not R at position 2 or 5.

So for N, cannot be at 3 or 4, so only positions 1,2,5.

For E, cannot be at 4 or 5, so only 1,2,3.

For R, cannot be at 2 or 5, so only 1,3,4.

Now, in ""tenor"", N at 3 is invalid, so avoid.

Similarly, back to ""enrol"": E at1, N at2, R at3, O at4, L at5.

N at position 2: allowed (since N can be at 1,2,5)

R at position 3: allowed (R can be at 1,3,4)

E at position 1: allowed.

And positions are all new for the letters.

So I think it's a good guess.

Perhaps ""ebbed"" but duplicate and B, E at1, B2,B3,E4,D5 — E at4 not allowed.

Not good.

""adobe"" A out.

So I'll go with ""enrol"".

But ""enrol"" might be spelled with one L, and it's valid.

To use more common letters, but O and L are common.

Another word: ""stone"" but N at4 and E at5 not allowed.

""shone"" same issue.

""alone"" A out.

""prone"" P,R,O,N,E — positions: P1,R2,O3,N4,E5.

R at position 2: but R cannot be at position 2 from Guess 1, so invalid.

N at4 invalid, E at5 invalid.

Not good.

""crony"" C out.

So ""enrol"" seems fine.

Perhaps ""grown"" no E.

I think we should use ""enrol"".

But let's confirm the feedback.

In Guess 2, we have N at position 3 got ""-"", so N not at 3.

In ""enrol"", N is at position 2, which is different.

Similarly.

Another option: ""rouen"" R,O,U,E,N — positions: R1,O2,U3,E4,N5.

But E at position 4: not allowed, and N at position 5: possible, but E at4 invalid.

Not good.

""urine"" U,R,I,N,E — but I out.

I not in word.

""drone"" D,R,O,N,E — positions: D1,R2,O3,N4,E5.

R at2 invalid, N at4 invalid, E at5 invalid.

Not good.

So I think ""enrol"" is a reasonable choice.

<guess>enrol</guess>

But let's spell it: E-N-R-O-L.

Yes.

Perhaps ""enrol"" is not very common; ""renal"" but A out.

""tenet"" duplicate.

I think it's ok.

So for the third guess, I'll go with ""enrol"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)**  
  This means:  
  - C and A are not in the secret word.  
  - R, N, and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions:  
    - R is not in position 2.  
    - N is not in position 4.  
    - E is not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: ""miner"" → Feedback: M(x) I(x) N(-) E(-) R(-)**  
  This means:  
  - M and I are not in the secret word.  
  - N, E, and R are in the secret word but in the wrong positions:  
    - N is not in position 3.  
    - E is not in position 4.  
    - R is not in position 5.  

### Combined Information:
- **Confirmed absent letters:** C, A, M, I (cannot be used).  
- **Confirmed present letters:** R, N, E (must be included in the guess).  
- **Position constraints:**  
  - R cannot be in positions 2 or 5. Possible positions: 1, 3, or 4.  
  - N cannot be in positions 3 or 4. Possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.  
  - E cannot be in positions 4 or 5. Possible positions: 1, 2, or 3.  
- The secret word has 5 letters, so we need to find two additional unknown letters (not C, A, M, I).  

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- Reuse the confirmed letters (R, N, E) in new positions that fit the constraints to narrow down their locations.  
- Introduce two new, common letters to test for their presence and positions.  
- Avoid positions that are already ruled out for R, N, and E.  
- Choose a valid 5-letter word that maximizes information.  

### Chosen Guess: ""enrol""
- **Breakdown of ""enrol"":**  
  - Position 1: E (E is possible here, as E can be in position 1, 2, or 3).  
  - Position 2: N (N is possible here, as N can be in position 1, 2, or 5).  
  - Position 3: R (R is possible here, as R can be in position 1, 3, or 4).  
  - Position 4: O (new letter, not tested before).  
  - Position 5: L (new letter, not tested before).  
- **Why ""enrol""?**  
  - It places R, N, and E in positions that are all new and allowed based on feedback (e.g., E not in 4/5, N not in 3/4, R not in 2/5).  
  - It tests two new common letters (O and L) that could be part of the secret word.  
  - It is a valid English word (meaning: to enroll or register).  
- **Expected outcomes:**  
  - If E is correct in position 1, it will be marked ""✓"".  
  - If N is correct in position 2, it will be marked ""✓"".  
  - If R is correct in position 3, it will be marked ""✓"".  
  - O and L will provide new feedback (e.g., ""✓"" if correct, ""-"" if present but wrong position, or ""x"" if absent).  

This guess efficiently repositions the known letters while exploring new possibilities.

The word was ""crane"", and the feedback is:\n\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- E: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\nSo, from this:\n\n- Letters C and A are not in the secret word.\n- R is in the word but not in the first position (since it was guessed there).\n- N is in the word but not in the fourth position.\n- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.\n\nAlso, since R, N, and E are all present, they must be somewhere else in the word.\n\nNow, the secret word is a 5-letter word containing R, N, and E, but not C or A.\n\nWe need to make a new guess that incorporates this information.\n\nAvailable letters: R, N, E must be included, but in different positions since their current positions are wrong.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- R is not in position 1 (we guessed it there).\n- N is not in position 4.\n- E is not in position 5.\n\nAlso, we need to choose positions where R, N, E can be placed.\n\nMoreover, since C and A are out, we should avoid using them in the new guess.\n\nThe word must consist of letters including R, N, E, and two other letters that are not C or A. But we don\'t know what those are yet.\n\nPossible letters: Since common letters, we might consider other vowels or consonants.\n\nBut E is already in the word; it\'s a vowel, so there might be other vowels.\n\nThe secret word has R, N, E, so it must contain these three, and two more letters.\n\nWe need to guess a word that includes R, N, E in positions different from the first guess.\n\nIn ""crane"":\n\nPositions:\n1: C (x)\n2: R (-)\n3: A (x)\n4: N (-)\n5: E (-)\n\nSo:\n- Position 1: not C\n- Position 2: not R, but R is in the word\n- Position 3: not A\n- Position 4: not N\n- Position 5: not E\n\nR must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5 but not 2. Positions available: 1,3,4,5 since it can\'t be in 2.\n\nSimilarly, N cannot be in 4, so it must be in 1,2,3, or 5.\n\nE cannot be in 5, so it must be in 1,2,3, or 4.\n\nAlso, positions 1 and 3 are now open, since C and A are out.\n\nIn the new guess, I need to place R, N, E in different positions.\n\nMoreover, the word should be a valid English word.\n\nI could use a word that has R, N, E but rearranged.\n\nCommon words with R, N, E: for example, ""inner"" but that has N twice, and E, but E is not in position 5? Let\'s not assume.\n\nBetter to think of words without repeating letters if possible.\n\nSince we have feedback that R, N, E are present, we want to reposition them.\n\nAlso, we need to include two new letters that might be in the word or not.\n\nA strategic guess would be to place R, N, E in possible positions and introduce new letters.\n\nLet me brainstorm some words that contain R, N, E, but not C or A.\n\nFor example:\n\n- ""liner"": but L is another letter, and E is at the end. In ""crane"", E is at position 5, but feedback shows E is wrong position, so in secret word, E is not at position 5, but could be elsewhere. In ""liner"", if E is at position 5, but secret E not at 5, so not suitable.\n\nIf I guess ""liner"", and E is at 5, but if secret has E not at 5, that might not be good, but in this case, since E must be elsewhere, guessing a word with E at 5 would give feedback, but it might be inefficient if E is fixed elsewhere.\n\nI should avoid placing E at position 5 again, similarly for others.\n\nLet me consider possible positions:\n\nFrom feedback:\n\n- R cannot be at position 2. Possible positions for R: 1,3,4,5\n\n- N cannot be at position 4. Possible: 1,2,3,5\n\n- E cannot be at position 5. Possible: 1,2,3,4\n\nAlso, since R, N, E are all in the word, and word has two more letters.\n\nNow, for the new guess, I need to choose positions for R,N,E and two other letters.\n\nI should choose common letters not yet tried. C and A are out, so avoid them.\n\nLetters not tried: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nVowels: I,O,U are possible; consonants: many.\n\nSince E is already a vowel, perhaps others are consonants.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nTo maximize information, a good approach is to include letters that are common and not yet tested.\n\nBut in this case, we already know R,N,E are present, so I should focus on finding their positions and testing new letters.\n\nStandard advice in Wordle is to reuse the present letters but in new positions to find their locations.\n\nSo, for the second guess, I should create a word that includes R,N,E, but in positions different from before.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- R not at 2\n\n- N not at 4\n\n- E not at 5\n\nAnd introduce new letters.\n\nLet me think of words with R,N,E.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""rinse"": positions: R at 1, I at 2, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5. But E is at position 5, which is forbidden because from feedback, E cannot be at position 5. So guessing ""rinse"" would have E at position 5, which we know is wrong, so it\'s inefficient; we might waste that position.\n\nSimilarly, if I guess E at 5, I know it will be wrong, so better to place E elsewhere.\n\nFor example:\n- ""reign"": R at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5. Now, positions: R at position 1 (was not position 1 before, but no feedback against position 1 yet), E at position 2 (previously not tested there), N at position 5 (previously not position 4, but position 5 is new).\n\nIn ""crane"", we only know that R is not at 2, N not at 4, E not at 5. Position 1 could have R or something else.\n\nIn ""reign"":\n- Position 1: R\n- Position 2: E\n- Position 3: I (new)\n- Position 4: G (new)\n- Position 5: N\n\nN at position 5: previously, N was at position 4 and wrong, so position 5 could be possible for N.\n\nE at position 2: previously E was at position 5 and wrong, so position 2 could be possible.\n\nSimilarly, R at position 1: previously R was at position 2 and wrong, so position 1 could be correct or wrong position.\n\nThis seems reasonable.\n\nAnother word: ""nerve"" but has E twice and R repeat, might not be ideal.\n\n""hinge"" – has H,I,N,G,E – position 5 is E, but E cannot be at 5, so avoid.\n\n""miner"" – M,I,N,E,R – positions: M at 1, I at 2, N at 3, E at 4, R at 5. N at position 3, E at position 4 (not 5), R at position 5. Possible.\n\nLet\'s list:\n\n- ""reign"" : R at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5\n\n- ""inter"" : I at 1, N at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5. E at position 4.\n\n- ""inert"" : similar to inter but with T, I,N,E,R,T? ""inert"" is I,N,E,R,T positions: I at1, N at2, E at3, R at4, T at5. But N at position 2? Previously N was not at position 4, but position 2 could be possible.\n\nPossible candidates:\n\n- ""reign"" : R,E,I,G,N — with E at position 2 and N at position 5.\n\n""reign"" might not be the most common word, but it\'s valid.\n\n- ""mince"" — but C is out! C is not in word, avoid C.\n\nC is confirmed not in word, so don\'t use C.\n\nSimilarly, A not in word.\n\nSo, letters to avoid: C, A.\n\n""miner"" : M,I,N,E,R — no C or A.\n\nPositions: M at1, I at2, N at3, E at4, R at5.\n\nThen:\n- Position 1: M new\n- Position 2: I new\n- Position 3: N — previously N was at position 4 and wrong; position 3 is new for N\n- Position 4: E — previously E was at position 5 and wrong; position 4 is new for E\n- Position 5: R — previously R was at position 2 and wrong; position 5 is new for R\n\nAll positions for R,N,E are new, and we introduce M and I.\n\nThis seems good.\n\nAnother one: ""liner"" : L,I,N,E,R — N at3, E at4, R at5 — E at position 4, not 5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut ""liner"" has L and I new.\n\n""miner"" might be better because of common letters.\n\nPerhaps ""point"" but no E? But we must include E because it\'s in the word. No, we know E is in the word, so the guess must include E to gather more position info, but we can choose not to include it if we want to test other letters, but since we know it\'s in, better to include it to pin its position.\n\nStandard strategy is to include confirmed letters in new positions.\n\nSimilarly for R and N.\n\nSo yes.\n\nOther words: ""bakes"" but A is invalid, and K,S new, but no R or N? Must include R,N,E? Not necessarily, but if I don\'t include them, I might not get position info.\n\nFor example, I could guess a word with entirely new letters to test new ones, leaving R,N,E positions unknown later.\n\nBut that might be less efficient because I have three known letters.\n\nTypically, it\'s better to reposition the known present letters.\n\nSo I think ""miner"" is a good choice.\n\n"" reign"" and ""miner"", both fine.\n\n""inter"" : I,N,T,E,R — positions: I at1, N at2, T at3, E at4, R at5\n\nN at position 2: possible, no feedback against position 2 for N.\n\nSimilarly E at4, R at5.\n\nIntroducing I and T.\n\nI is a common vowel.\n\nLet\'s decide: I\'ll go with ""miner"" for now.\n\nBut ""miner"" has N at position 3 and E at position 4.\n\nIn the secret word, R must be placed: if not in position 2, and in this guess, if I have R at position 5, etc.\n\nAnother word: ""rouse"" — R,O,U,S,E — but E at position 5 again, which is invalid position for E, so avoid.\n\nSimilarly, ""serve"" E at end.\n\nAvoid any E at position 5.\n\nAlso, N not at position 4, so avoid placing N at position 4.\n\nIn my guess, I shouldn\'t place N at position 4 or E at position 5, because I know those are wrong.\n\nIn ""miner"", I placed N at position 3, E at position 4 — position 3 and 4 are both different from previous.\n\nPrevious: N was at position 4, now I place at position 3; E was at position 5, now at position 4; R was at position 2, now at position 5. All different positions.\n\nGood.\n\nSimilarly in ""inter"": N at position 2, E at 4, R at 5.\n\nPosition 2 for N: possible, since N was at position 4 before and wrong, but position 2 could be correct.\n\nNo restriction.\n\nI think ""miner"" is fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the word is valid. Yes.\n\nPerhaps I can consider ""shine"" but no R? ""shine"" has S,H,I,N,E — missing R.\n\nMust include R? Not necessarily, but if I guess ""shine"", I test S,H,I,N,E with N at position 4? Position 4: but N cannot be at position 4 from previous feedback? In ""crane"", N at position 4 was wrong, so if I guess ""shine"" with N at position 4, it will be wrong, wasted opportunity.\n\nIn ""shine"": positions: S at1, H at2, I at3, N at4, E at5\n\nN at position 4: we know from feedback that position 4 is not N, so guessing N at position 4 will definitely get ""x"" or ""-"" but since we know it\'s wrong position, if it\'s ""-"" it means N is in word but not here, which we know, or ""x"" meaning not, but we know N is in word, so if I place N at position 4, I get ""-"" meaning wrong position, which we already know, or if it mistakenly ""x"" but since N is in word, it should be ""-"" .

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
- C and A are absent.
- R, N, E are present but not in positions 2, 4, and 5 respectively.

Guess 2: ""miner"" -> M(x) I(x) N(-) E(-) R(-)
- M and I are absent.
- N, E, R are present but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively.

Guess 3: ""enrol"" -> E(-) N(-) R(✓) O(x) L(x)
- E is present but not in position 1 (since E(-) at position 1).
- N is present but not in position 2 (since N(-) at position 2).
- R is correct at position 3 (R(✓)).
- O and L are absent.

Now, combining all information:

Absent letters: C, A, M, I, O, L
Present letters: R, N, E (from all guesses) and we have R fixed at position 3.

Since R is correct at position 3, we know:
- The secret word has R in the third position.

Now, for E and N:
- E is present but not in position 1 (from Guess 3), not in position 4 (from Guess 2), and not in position 5 (from Guess 1). So E cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5. The only possible positions left for E are 2 or 3. But position 3 is taken by R, so E must be in position 2.

Let's list possible positions for E:
- From Guess 1: E not in position 5.
- From Guess 2: E not in position 4.
- From Guess 3: E not in position 1.
- Also, E cannot be in position 3 because that's where R is (and fixed).
- So the only position left for E is position 2.

Similarly, for N:
- From Guess 1: N not in position 4.
- From Guess 2: N not in position 3.
- From Guess 3: N not in position 2.
- Also, position 3 is taken by R, so N cannot be there.
- Possible positions for N: 1 or 5 (since 2,3,4 are ruled out).

So N must be in position 1 or 5.

Now, the secret word has:
- Position 3: R (fixed)
- Position 2: E (we just deduced, but let's confirm)

We have E must be in position 2 because:
- E is present and cannot be in 1,3,4,5 -> only 2 left.

Similarly, N must be in 1 or 5.

Now, the word has two more letters: positions 1, 4, and 5, but N will take one of 1 or 5, and the other two positions are for new letters.

Specifically:
- If N is at position 1, then positions 4 and 5 are for two new letters.
- If N is at position 5, then positions 1 and 4 are for two new letters.

But we also know that the word has exactly 5 letters, and we have R and E fixed at 3 and 2, and N at 1 or 5.

Now, from the feedback, we have absent letters: C, A, M, I, O, L.

So we need to choose a word that:
- Has E at position 2 (since we are sure it must be there? Not yet, but let's see)

Actually, we haven't confirmed E at position 2 by feedback, but by process of elimination. We should test it.

But in the guess, we can set E at position 2 to confirm.

Similarly, we need to test N at position 1 or 5.

But let's form the word.

We know position 2 must be E (because no other position possible for E).

Position 3 is R.

So the word is: _ E R _ _

Now, N must be at position 1 or 5.

We also need to fill the remaining positions with new letters, avoiding absent letters.

Absent letters: C, A, M, I, O, L

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common letters: S, T, D, H, U, etc.

Now, for the fourth guess, we can try to set N at position 1 and see.

If we set N at position 1, then word: N E R _ _

We need to fill positions 4 and 5 with two new letters.

Possible words: ""nerdy"" but D and Y, and Y is less common, and L is out but D is new.

""nerds"": N,E,R,D,S — positions: N1,E2,R3,D4,S5

But we don't know if D and S are in the word.

Similarly, ""nerdy"" is N,E,R,D,Y.

But let's see if we can cover both cases.

Since N could be at 5, we might set N at 5 to test.

But let's think strategically.

We can set E at position 2 and R at position 3, and then for position 1, we can put a new letter, and position 5 put N, and position 4 put another new letter, for example.

But we need to form a valid word.

List possible words with pattern _ E R _ _

With N in position 1 or 5.

First, if N at position 1: words like ""nerdy"", ""nerds"", ""nerka"" (not common), ""nerol"" but O and L out.

O and L are absent, so cannot use.

""berth"" B,E,R,T,H — but no N, so if N is at position 1, we must have N there.

If we assume N at position 1, then the word starts with N, then E,R, so ""NER..""

Common words: ""nerve"" but E repeated and V, but E at position 2 and 5? ""nerve"" is N,E,R,V,E — but E at position 5 is not allowed (from feedback, E not at 5), and also duplicate E.

""nerds"" is good: N,E,R,D,S

""nerdy"" N,E,R,D,Y

""nertz"" not common.

""nervy"" N,E,R,V,Y — but E at2, R at3, V at4, Y at5.

Now, V and Y are possible.

But we have to avoid O and L, etc.

If N at position 5, then word: _ E R _ N

Common words: ""stern"" S,T,E,R,N — positions: S1,T2,E3? No, we need E at position 2.

Pattern: position 2 is E, position 3 is R, position 5 is N.

So: ? E R ? N

Words: ""beryn"" not word.

""derby"" but Y, and positions: D1,E2,R3,B4,Y5 — but we need N at position 5, but here Y at5.

""fermn"" not word.

""germn"" not.

""heron"" H,E,R,O,N — but O is absent, and O at position 4.

""jern"" not 5 letters.

""pern"" not.

""terns"" T,E,R,N,S — positions: T1,E2,R3,N4,S5 — but N at position 4? But from feedback, N cannot be at position 4 (Guess 1: N not at 4). So if we place N at position 4, it would be invalid, but in this word ""terns"", N is at position 4, which is forbidden.

Similarly, ""ferns"" F,E,R,N,S — N at4.

Not allowed.

""kerne"" K,E,R,N,E — duplicate E and N at4.

""verse"" no N.

""werns"" not common.

""yearn"" Y,E,A,R,N — but A absent.

""zeron"" not.

So it seems difficult to find a word with N at position 5 and E at2, R at3.

Perhaps ""serin"" but I absent, and positions S1,E2,R3,I4,N5 — but I is absent, so cannot use.

I is out.

""merit"" M out, and I.

So no.

Therefore, it's more likely that N is at position 1.

So the word is N E R _ _

Now, we need to fill positions 4 and 5 with two letters from available, forming a valid word.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common words: ""nerds"" with D and S.

""nerdy"" with D and Y.

""nerka"" not common.

""nerol"" O and L out.

""berth"" but no N at1? ""berth"" is B,E,R,T,H — no N, but we need N at1.

If we have N at1, it must be included.

So ""nerds"" is a good candidate.

""nerdy"" is also common.

But let's see if we can get more information.

Since we have to guess, and we are not sure about N at1, but from deduction, N must be at1 or5, and 5 is hard, so probably at1.

In the guess, we can set N at1 and E at2 and R at3, and then test two new letters.

For example, ""nerds"" tests D and S.

""nerdy"" tests D and Y.

S is more common than Y, so ""nerds"" might be better.

But we also have position 4 and 5.

Another word: ""nerka"" not common.

""jerky"" J,E,R,K,Y — but no N at1.

We need N at1.

So ""nerds"" or ""nerdy"".

Perhaps ""nerve"" but E at5 not allowed and duplicate.

Not possible.

So I think ""nerds"" is a valid choice.

But in ""nerds"", positions: N1, E2, R3, D4, S5.

Now, we know E must be at position 2? We deduced it, but let's see if the feedback confirms.

In this guess, if we set E at position 2, and if it is correct, we get ✓, else if not, we get - but we think it must be there.

Similarly, R at3 is fixed, so ✓.

N at1: if correct, ✓, if not, then N must be at5, but we will see.

But in this case, for the fourth guess, we can use ""nerds"".

But let's see if there is a word that tests both possibilities, but it's hard.

Another idea: since position 1 could be N or another letter, but we know N must be at1 or5, so if we set position 1 to a new letter, and position 5 to N, but we couldn't find a word.

For example, ""? E R ? N"" with ? not N, but we need a word.

""avern"" A out.

""beryn"" not word.

""derby"" not N at5.

""ferny"" F,E,R,N,Y — positions: F1,E2,R3,N4,Y5 — but N at position 4 not allowed.

""heron"" O out.

""peril"" I and L out.

""seron"" not.

""teryn"" not.

""verge"" no N.

So no common words with pattern ? E R ? N.

Therefore, the only possibility is N at position 1, so the word is N E R _ _

Thus, for the guess, we can use ""nerds"" to test D and S.

If we get feedback that N at1 is correct, E at2 correct, R at3 correct, then we only need to find the last two letters.

But in this case, for position 4 and 5.

In ""nerds"", we have D and S at4 and5.

But we can also consider other words like ""nerdy"", but S is more common.

""nerd"" is not 5 letters.

""terms"" but T,E,R,M,S — M out, and no N.

Not.

""germs"" G,E,R,M,S — M out.

""herbs"" H,E,R,B,S — no N.

So ""nerds"" seems best.

Perhaps ""nerka"" but not common.

I think ""nerds"" is fine.

So for the fourth guess, I'll go with ""nerds"".
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

Based on the feedback from previous guesses, here's the analysis:

1. **Absent Letters (x):** C, A, M, I, O, L (from all feedback).
2. **Present Letters:**
   - R, N, E are confirmed to be in the word (from multiple guesses).
   - R is fixed in position 3 (from Guess 3: R(✓)).
3. **Position Constraints for E:**
   - E cannot be in position 1 (Guess 3: E(-) at position 1).
   - E cannot be in position 4 (Guess 2: E(-) at position 4).
   - E cannot be in position 5 (Guess 1: E(-) at position 5).
   - Since position 3 is occupied by R, the only possible position left for E is position 2.
4. **Position Constraints for N:**
   - N cannot be in position 2 (Guess 3: N(-) at position 2).
   - N cannot be in position 3 (Guess 2: N(-) at position 3).
   - N cannot be in position 4 (Guess 1: N(-) at position 4).
   - Possible positions for N are 1 or 5 (since positions 2, 3, and 4 are ruled out).
5. **Word Structure:**
   - Position 2 must be E (deduced from constraints).
   - Position 3 is R (fixed).
   - N must be in position 1 or 5.
   - The remaining positions (4 and 5 if N is at 1, or 1 and 4 if N is at 5) must be filled with new letters not yet tested and not absent.
6. **Testing Strategy:**
   - Since no valid common words exist for the pattern `? E R ? N` (e.g., N at position 5) without using absent letters (like O, I, L), N is likely in position 1.
   - Thus, the word pattern is `N E R _ _`.
   - For positions 4 and 5, introduce new common letters to test for presence/position. Absent letters (C, A, M, I, O, L) must be avoided.
   - ""nerds"" is a valid word that fits: N at position 1 (tests if N is correct here), E at position 2 (expected to be correct), R at position 3 (fixed), and introduces D and S (common untested letters).

**Why ""nerds""?**
- Confirms E at position 2 (if correct, it will be ""✓""; if not, it rules out position 2, but deduction suggests it must be here).
- Tests N at position 1 (if ""✓"", N is confirmed; if ""-"", N must be at position 5).
- Tests new letters D and S for positions 4 and 5.
- Uses common letters and avoids absent ones.

<guess>nerds</guess>",nerds,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
- C and A are absent.
- R, N, E are present but not in positions 2, 4, and 5 respectively.

Guess 2: ""miner"" -> M(x) I(x) N(-) E(-) R(-)
- M and I are absent.
- N, E, R are present but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively.

Guess 3: ""enrol"" -> E(-) N(-) R(✓) O(x) L(x)
- E is present but not in position 1 (since E(-) at position 1).
- N is present but not in position 2 (since N(-) at position 2).
- R is correct at position 3 (R(✓)).
- O and L are absent.

Now, combining all information:

Absent letters: C, A, M, I, O, L
Present letters: R, N, E (from all guesses) and we have R fixed at position 3.

Since R is correct at position 3, we know:
- The secret word has R in the third position.

Now, for E and N:
- E is present but not in position 1 (from Guess 3), not in position 4 (from Guess 2), and not in position 5 (from Guess 1). So E cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5. The only possible positions left for E are 2 or 3. But position 3 is taken by R, so E must be in position 2.

Let's list possible positions for E:
- From Guess 1: E not in position 5.
- From Guess 2: E not in position 4.
- From Guess 3: E not in position 1.
- Also, E cannot be in position 3 because that's where R is (and fixed).
- So the only position left for E is position 2.

Similarly, for N:
- From Guess 1: N not in position 4.
- From Guess 2: N not in position 3.
- From Guess 3: N not in position 2.
- Also, position 3 is taken by R, so N cannot be there.
- Possible positions for N: 1 or 5 (since 2,3,4 are ruled out).

So N must be in position 1 or 5.

Now, the secret word has:
- Position 3: R (fixed)
- Position 2: E (we just deduced, but let's confirm)

We have E must be in position 2 because:
- E is present and cannot be in 1,3,4,5 -> only 2 left.

Similarly, N must be in 1 or 5.

Now, the word has two more letters: positions 1, 4, and 5, but N will take one of 1 or 5, and the other two positions are for new letters.

Specifically:
- If N is at position 1, then positions 4 and 5 are for two new letters.
- If N is at position 5, then positions 1 and 4 are for two new letters.

But we also know that the word has exactly 5 letters, and we have R and E fixed at 3 and 2, and N at 1 or 5.

Now, from the feedback, we have absent letters: C, A, M, I, O, L.

So we need to choose a word that:
- Has E at position 2 (since we are sure it must be there? Not yet, but let's see)

Actually, we haven't confirmed E at position 2 by feedback, but by process of elimination. We should test it.

But in the guess, we can set E at position 2 to confirm.

Similarly, we need to test N at position 1 or 5.

But let's form the word.

We know position 2 must be E (because no other position possible for E).

Position 3 is R.

So the word is: _ E R _ _

Now, N must be at position 1 or 5.

We also need to fill the remaining positions with new letters, avoiding absent letters.

Absent letters: C, A, M, I, O, L

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common letters: S, T, D, H, U, etc.

Now, for the fourth guess, we can try to set N at position 1 and see.

If we set N at position 1, then word: N E R _ _

We need to fill positions 4 and 5 with two new letters.

Possible words: ""nerdy"" but D and Y, and Y is less common, and L is out but D is new.

""nerds"": N,E,R,D,S — positions: N1,E2,R3,D4,S5

But we don't know if D and S are in the word.

Similarly, ""nerdy"" is N,E,R,D,Y.

But let's see if we can cover both cases.

Since N could be at 5, we might set N at 5 to test.

But let's think strategically.

We can set E at position 2 and R at position 3, and then for position 1, we can put a new letter, and position 5 put N, and position 4 put another new letter, for example.

But we need to form a valid word.

List possible words with pattern _ E R _ _

With N in position 1 or 5.

First, if N at position 1: words like ""nerdy"", ""nerds"", ""nerka"" (not common), ""nerol"" but O and L out.

O and L are absent, so cannot use.

""berth"" B,E,R,T,H — but no N, so if N is at position 1, we must have N there.

If we assume N at position 1, then the word starts with N, then E,R, so ""NER..""

Common words: ""nerve"" but E repeated and V, but E at position 2 and 5? ""nerve"" is N,E,R,V,E — but E at position 5 is not allowed (from feedback, E not at 5), and also duplicate E.

""nerds"" is good: N,E,R,D,S

""nerdy"" N,E,R,D,Y

""nertz"" not common.

""nervy"" N,E,R,V,Y — but E at2, R at3, V at4, Y at5.

Now, V and Y are possible.

But we have to avoid O and L, etc.

If N at position 5, then word: _ E R _ N

Common words: ""stern"" S,T,E,R,N — positions: S1,T2,E3? No, we need E at position 2.

Pattern: position 2 is E, position 3 is R, position 5 is N.

So: ? E R ? N

Words: ""beryn"" not word.

""derby"" but Y, and positions: D1,E2,R3,B4,Y5 — but we need N at position 5, but here Y at5.

""fermn"" not word.

""germn"" not.

""heron"" H,E,R,O,N — but O is absent, and O at position 4.

""jern"" not 5 letters.

""pern"" not.

""terns"" T,E,R,N,S — positions: T1,E2,R3,N4,S5 — but N at position 4? But from feedback, N cannot be at position 4 (Guess 1: N not at 4). So if we place N at position 4, it would be invalid, but in this word ""terns"", N is at position 4, which is forbidden.

Similarly, ""ferns"" F,E,R,N,S — N at4.

Not allowed.

""kerne"" K,E,R,N,E — duplicate E and N at4.

""verse"" no N.

""werns"" not common.

""yearn"" Y,E,A,R,N — but A absent.

""zeron"" not.

So it seems difficult to find a word with N at position 5 and E at2, R at3.

Perhaps ""serin"" but I absent, and positions S1,E2,R3,I4,N5 — but I is absent, so cannot use.

I is out.

""merit"" M out, and I.

So no.

Therefore, it's more likely that N is at position 1.

So the word is N E R _ _

Now, we need to fill positions 4 and 5 with two letters from available, forming a valid word.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common words: ""nerds"" with D and S.

""nerdy"" with D and Y.

""nerka"" not common.

""nerol"" O and L out.

""berth"" but no N at1? ""berth"" is B,E,R,T,H — no N, but we need N at1.

If we have N at1, it must be included.

So ""nerds"" is a good candidate.

""nerdy"" is also common.

But let's see if we can get more information.

Since we have to guess, and we are not sure about N at1, but from deduction, N must be at1 or5, and 5 is hard, so probably at1.

In the guess, we can set N at1 and E at2 and R at3, and then test two new letters.

For example, ""nerds"" tests D and S.

""nerdy"" tests D and Y.

S is more common than Y, so ""nerds"" might be better.

But we also have position 4 and 5.

Another word: ""nerka"" not common.

""jerky"" J,E,R,K,Y — but no N at1.

We need N at1.

So ""nerds"" or ""nerdy"".

Perhaps ""nerve"" but E at5 not allowed and duplicate.

Not possible.

So I think ""nerds"" is a valid choice.

But in ""nerds"", positions: N1, E2, R3, D4, S5.

Now, we know E must be at position 2? We deduced it, but let's see if the feedback confirms.

In this guess, if we set E at position 2, and if it is correct, we get ✓, else if not, we get - but we think it must be there.

Similarly, R at3 is fixed, so ✓.

N at1: if correct, ✓, if not, then N must be at5, but we will see.

But in this case, for the fourth guess, we can use ""nerds"".

But let's see if there is a word that tests both possibilities, but it's hard.

Another idea: since position 1 could be N or another letter, but we know N must be at1 or5, so if we set position 1 to a new letter, and position 5 to N, but we couldn't find a word.

For example, ""? E R ? N"" with ? not N, but we need a word.

""avern"" A out.

""beryn"" not word.

""derby"" not N at5.

""ferny"" F,E,R,N,Y — positions: F1,E2,R3,N4,Y5 — but N at position 4 not allowed.

""heron"" O out.

""peril"" I and L out.

""seron"" not.

""teryn"" not.

""verge"" no N.

So no common words with pattern ? E R ? N.

Therefore, the only possibility is N at position 1, so the word is N E R _ _

Thus, for the guess, we can use ""nerds"" to test D and S.

If we get feedback that N at1 is correct, E at2 correct, R at3 correct, then we only need to find the last two letters.

But in this case, for position 4 and 5.

In ""nerds"", we have D and S at4 and5.

But we can also consider other words like ""nerdy"", but S is more common.

""nerd"" is not 5 letters.

""terms"" but T,E,R,M,S — M out, and no N.

Not.

""germs"" G,E,R,M,S — M out.

""herbs"" H,E,R,B,S — no N.

So ""nerds"" seems best.

Perhaps ""nerka"" but not common.

I think ""nerds"" is fine.

So for the fourth guess, I'll go with ""nerds"".### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

Based on the feedback from previous guesses, here's the analysis:

1. **Absent Letters (x):** C, A, M, I, O, L (from all feedback).
2. **Present Letters:**
   - R, N, E are confirmed to be in the word (from multiple guesses).
   - R is fixed in position 3 (from Guess 3: R(✓)).
3. **Position Constraints for E:**
   - E cannot be in position 1 (Guess 3: E(-) at position 1).
   - E cannot be in position 4 (Guess 2: E(-) at position 4).
   - E cannot be in position 5 (Guess 1: E(-) at position 5).
   - Since position 3 is occupied by R, the only possible position left for E is position 2.
4. **Position Constraints for N:**
   - N cannot be in position 2 (Guess 3: N(-) at position 2).
   - N cannot be in position 3 (Guess 2: N(-) at position 3).
   - N cannot be in position 4 (Guess 1: N(-) at position 4).
   - Possible positions for N are 1 or 5 (since positions 2, 3, and 4 are ruled out).
5. **Word Structure:**
   - Position 2 must be E (deduced from constraints).
   - Position 3 is R (fixed).
   - N must be in position 1 or 5.
   - The remaining positions (4 and 5 if N is at 1, or 1 and 4 if N is at 5) must be filled with new letters not yet tested and not absent.
6. **Testing Strategy:**
   - Since no valid common words exist for the pattern `? E R ? N` (e.g., N at position 5) without using absent letters (like O, I, L), N is likely in position 1.
   - Thus, the word pattern is `N E R _ _`.
   - For positions 4 and 5, introduce new common letters to test for presence/position. Absent letters (C, A, M, I, O, L) must be avoided.
   - ""nerds"" is a valid word that fits: N at position 1 (tests if N is correct here), E at position 2 (expected to be correct), R at position 3 (fixed), and introduces D and S (common untested letters).

**Why ""nerds""?**
- Confirms E at position 2 (if correct, it will be ""✓""; if not, it rules out position 2, but deduction suggests it must be here).
- Tests N at position 1 (if ""✓"", N is confirmed; if ""-"", N must be at position 5).
- Tests new letters D and S for positions 4 and 5.
- Uses common letters and avoids absent ones.",Guess 4: nerds -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) E(✓) R(✓) D(✓) S(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and maximizes the information we get.
 Common vowels in English: A, E, I, O, U
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 A good starting word is one that has common letters and no repeating letters. 
 Some popular starting words are: CRANE, SLATE, AUDIO, STARE, ROATE, etc.

 I choose ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N). 
 It covers a good set of letters and is a valid 5-letter word.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>First, let's analyze the feedback from the first guess. The word was ""crane"", and the feedback is:

- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this:

- Letters C and A are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in the first position (since it was guessed there).
- N is in the word but not in the fourth position.
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

Also, since R, N, and E are all present, they must be somewhere else in the word.

Now, the secret word is a 5-letter word containing R, N, and E, but not C or A.

We need to make a new guess that incorporates this information.

Available letters: R, N, E must be included, but in different positions since their current positions are wrong.

Specifically:

- R is not in position 1 (we guessed it there).
- N is not in position 4.
- E is not in position 5.

Also, we need to choose positions where R, N, E can be placed.

Moreover, since C and A are out, we should avoid using them in the new guess.

The word must consist of letters including R, N, E, and two other letters that are not C or A. But we don't know what those are yet.

Possible letters: Since common letters, we might consider other vowels or consonants.

But E is already in the word; it's a vowel, so there might be other vowels.

The secret word has R, N, E, so it must contain these three, and two more letters.

We need to guess a word that includes R, N, E in positions different from the first guess.

In ""crane"":

Positions:
1: C (x)
2: R (-)
3: A (x)
4: N (-)
5: E (-)

So:
- Position 1: not C
- Position 2: not R, but R is in the word
- Position 3: not A
- Position 4: not N
- Position 5: not E

R must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5 but not 2. Positions available: 1,3,4,5 since it can't be in 2.

Similarly, N cannot be in 4, so it must be in 1,2,3, or 5.

E cannot be in 5, so it must be in 1,2,3, or 4.

Also, positions 1 and 3 are now open, since C and A are out.

In the new guess, I need to place R, N, E in different positions.

Moreover, the word should be a valid English word.

I could use a word that has R, N, E but rearranged.

Common words with R, N, E: for example, ""inner"" but that has N twice, and E, but E is not in position 5? Let's not assume.

Better to think of words without repeating letters if possible.

Since we have feedback that R, N, E are present, we want to reposition them.

Also, we need to include two new letters that might be in the word or not.

A strategic guess would be to place R, N, E in possible positions and introduce new letters.

Let me brainstorm some words that contain R, N, E, but not C or A.

For example:

- ""liner"": but L is another letter, and E is at the end. In ""crane"", E is at position 5, but feedback shows E is wrong position, so in secret word, E is not at position 5, but could be elsewhere. In ""liner"", if E is at position 5, but secret E not at 5, so not suitable.

If I guess ""liner"", and E is at 5, but if secret has E not at 5, that might not be good, but in this case, since E must be elsewhere, guessing a word with E at 5 would give feedback, but it might be inefficient if E is fixed elsewhere.

I should avoid placing E at position 5 again, similarly for others.

Let me consider possible positions:

From feedback:

- R cannot be at position 2. Possible positions for R: 1,3,4,5

- N cannot be at position 4. Possible: 1,2,3,5

- E cannot be at position 5. Possible: 1,2,3,4

Also, since R, N, E are all in the word, and word has two more letters.

Now, for the new guess, I need to choose positions for R,N,E and two other letters.

I should choose common letters not yet tried. C and A are out, so avoid them.

Letters not tried: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Vowels: I,O,U are possible; consonants: many.

Since E is already a vowel, perhaps others are consonants.

But we don't know.

To maximize information, a good approach is to include letters that are common and not yet tested.

But in this case, we already know R,N,E are present, so I should focus on finding their positions and testing new letters.

Standard advice in Wordle is to reuse the present letters but in new positions to find their locations.

So, for the second guess, I should create a word that includes R,N,E, but in positions different from before.

Specifically:

- R not at 2

- N not at 4

- E not at 5

And introduce new letters.

Let me think of words with R,N,E.

Possible words: 
- ""rinse"": positions: R at 1, I at 2, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5. But E is at position 5, which is forbidden because from feedback, E cannot be at position 5. So guessing ""rinse"" would have E at position 5, which we know is wrong, so it's inefficient; we might waste that position.

Similarly, if I guess E at 5, I know it will be wrong, so better to place E elsewhere.

For example:
- ""reign"": R at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5. Now, positions: R at position 1 (was not position 1 before, but no feedback against position 1 yet), E at position 2 (previously not tested there), N at position 5 (previously not position 4, but position 5 is new).

In ""crane"", we only know that R is not at 2, N not at 4, E not at 5. Position 1 could have R or something else.

In ""reign"":
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: I (new)
- Position 4: G (new)
- Position 5: N

N at position 5: previously, N was at position 4 and wrong, so position 5 could be possible for N.

E at position 2: previously E was at position 5 and wrong, so position 2 could be possible.

Similarly, R at position 1: previously R was at position 2 and wrong, so position 1 could be correct or wrong position.

This seems reasonable.

Another word: ""nerve"" but has E twice and R repeat, might not be ideal.

""hinge"" – has H,I,N,G,E – position 5 is E, but E cannot be at 5, so avoid.

""miner"" – M,I,N,E,R – positions: M at 1, I at 2, N at 3, E at 4, R at 5. N at position 3, E at position 4 (not 5), R at position 5. Possible.

Let's list:

- ""reign"" : R at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5

- ""inter"" : I at 1, N at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5. E at position 4.

- ""inert"" : similar to inter but with T, I,N,E,R,T? ""inert"" is I,N,E,R,T positions: I at1, N at2, E at3, R at4, T at5. But N at position 2? Previously N was not at position 4, but position 2 could be possible.

Possible candidates:

- ""reign"" : R,E,I,G,N — with E at position 2 and N at position 5.

""reign"" might not be the most common word, but it's valid.

- ""mince"" — but C is out! C is not in word, avoid C.

C is confirmed not in word, so don't use C.

Similarly, A not in word.

So, letters to avoid: C, A.

""miner"" : M,I,N,E,R — no C or A.

Positions: M at1, I at2, N at3, E at4, R at5.

Then:
- Position 1: M new
- Position 2: I new
- Position 3: N — previously N was at position 4 and wrong; position 3 is new for N
- Position 4: E — previously E was at position 5 and wrong; position 4 is new for E
- Position 5: R — previously R was at position 2 and wrong; position 5 is new for R

All positions for R,N,E are new, and we introduce M and I.

This seems good.

Another one: ""liner"" : L,I,N,E,R — N at3, E at4, R at5 — E at position 4, not 5.

Similarly.

But ""liner"" has L and I new.

""miner"" might be better because of common letters.

Perhaps ""point"" but no E? But we must include E because it's in the word. No, we know E is in the word, so the guess must include E to gather more position info, but we can choose not to include it if we want to test other letters, but since we know it's in, better to include it to pin its position.

Standard strategy is to include confirmed letters in new positions.

Similarly for R and N.

So yes.

Other words: ""bakes"" but A is invalid, and K,S new, but no R or N? Must include R,N,E? Not necessarily, but if I don't include them, I might not get position info.

For example, I could guess a word with entirely new letters to test new ones, leaving R,N,E positions unknown later.

But that might be less efficient because I have three known letters.

Typically, it's better to reposition the known present letters.

So I think ""miner"" is a good choice.

"" reign"" and ""miner"", both fine.

""inter"" : I,N,T,E,R — positions: I at1, N at2, T at3, E at4, R at5

N at position 2: possible, no feedback against position 2 for N.

Similarly E at4, R at5.

Introducing I and T.

I is a common vowel.

Let's decide: I'll go with ""miner"" for now.

But ""miner"" has N at position 3 and E at position 4.

In the secret word, R must be placed: if not in position 2, and in this guess, if I have R at position 5, etc.

Another word: ""rouse"" — R,O,U,S,E — but E at position 5 again, which is invalid position for E, so avoid.

Similarly, ""serve"" E at end.

Avoid any E at position 5.

Also, N not at position 4, so avoid placing N at position 4.

In my guess, I shouldn't place N at position 4 or E at position 5, because I know those are wrong.

In ""miner"", I placed N at position 3, E at position 4 — position 3 and 4 are both different from previous.

Previous: N was at position 4, now I place at position 3; E was at position 5, now at position 4; R was at position 2, now at position 5. All different positions.

Good.

Similarly in ""inter"": N at position 2, E at 4, R at 5.

Position 2 for N: possible, since N was at position 4 before and wrong, but position 2 could be correct.

No restriction.

I think ""miner"" is fine.

But let me confirm the word is valid. Yes.

Perhaps I can consider ""shine"" but no R? ""shine"" has S,H,I,N,E — missing R.

Must include R? Not necessarily, but if I guess ""shine"", I test S,H,I,N,E with N at position 4? Position 4: but N cannot be at position 4 from previous feedback? In ""crane"", N at position 4 was wrong, so if I guess ""shine"" with N at position 4, it will be wrong, wasted opportunity.

In ""shine"": positions: S at1, H at2, I at3, N at4, E at5

N at position 4: we know from feedback that position 4 is not N, so guessing N at position 4 will definitely get ""x"" or ""-"" but since we know it's wrong position, if it's ""-"" it means N is in word but not here, which we know, or ""x"" meaning not, but we know N is in word, so if I place N at position 4, I get ""-"" meaning wrong position, which we already know, or if it mistakenly ""x"" but since N is in word, it should be ""-"" . Feedback symbol: if letter in word but wrong position, ""-""; if not in word, ""x"".

Since we know N is in the word, if I place N at a wrong position, I will get ""-"", which doesn't give new information; it just confirms it's wrong, which we infer.

Specifically, if I deliberately place N at position 4, which we know is wrong, I will get ""-"" meaning it's still wrong position, but we already know that, so it doesn't help. Similarly, placing E at position 5 will get ""-"" meaning wrong position, which we know.

Therefore, it's inefficient; better to place at new positions to possibly get ""correct"" or new info.

So, in the guess, avoid placing R at position 2, N at position 4, E at position 5.

In fact, avoid those specific positions for those letters.

In the new guess, for letters we know are present but position wrong, do not place them in positions they were before if possible; place them where they could be correct.

Here, I need to place R not at 2, N not at 4, E not at 5.

So, for R: possible positions 1,3,4,5

N: 1,2,3,5

E: 1,2,3,4

Therefore, when forming a word, I should assign positions accordingly.

In ""miner"": M at1, I at2, N at3, E at4, R at5

So R at position 5: which is allowed since previously at 2, not here.

N at position 3: allowed, not position 4.

E at position 4: allowed, not position 5.

Also, position 4 for E: previously E was at position 5, now position 4 might be correct.

Similarly.

In ""reign"": R at1, E at2, I at3, G at4, N at5

E at position 2: not 5, ok.

N at position 5: not 4, ok.

R at position 1: not 2, ok.

Both are good.

I'll choose ""miner"" since ""miner"" has common consonants.

Another option: ""point"" no, must have E? No, but E is in word, so better include.

To be efficient.

I'll go with ""miner"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":

- C and A are not in the secret word (both marked ""x"").
- R, N, and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions:
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - N cannot be in position 4.
  - E cannot be in position 5.
- Therefore, the secret word contains R, N, and E elsewhere, along with two unknown letters.

For this second guess:
- We need to place R, N, and E in new possible positions to narrow down their locations:
  - R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
  - N can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
  - E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- We should avoid using C or A, as they are confirmed not in the word.
- The guess should introduce new, common letters to test for their presence and positions.
- ""miner"" is a valid 5-letter word that includes R, N, and E in repositioned locations:
  - R is at position 5 (new position, avoiding position 2).
  - N is at position 3 (new position, avoiding position 4).
  - E is at position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).
- It introduces M and I, two new vowels/consonants that are common and haven't been tested yet.
- This guess efficiently reuses known present letters while exploring new positions and letters.

<guess>miner</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: miner -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(-) E(-) R(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning:
- C and A are not in the word.
- R, N, E are in the word but not in positions 2, 4, and 5 respectively.

Guess 2: ""miner"" -> M(x) I(x) N(-) E(-) R(-)
Meaning:
- M and I are not in the word.
- N, E, R are in the word but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively.

Now, combining the information:

Letters not in the word: C, A, M, I
Letters in the word: R, N, E (from both guesses)

From Guess 1:
- R is not in position 2.
- N is not in position 4.
- E is not in position 5.

From Guess 2:
- N is not in position 3 (since N(-) at position 3).
- E is not in position 4 (since E(-) at position 4).
- R is not in position 5 (since R(-) at position 5).

Also, since R, N, E are all present, and we have two more letters to find.

Now, let's list possible positions for each:

For R:
- Cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 1) and position 5 (from Guess 2).
- So possible positions: 1, 3, 4.

For N:
- Cannot be in position 4 (from Guess 1) and position 3 (from Guess 2).
- So possible positions: 1, 2, 5.

For E:
- Cannot be in position 5 (from Guess 1) and position 4 (from Guess 2).
- So possible positions: 1, 2, 3.

We also know the word has 5 letters, so positions 1,2,3,4,5.

Now, we need to make a new guess that includes R, N, E in the possible positions and introduces two new letters (since C,A,M,I are out, and we need to test other letters).

Letters not used yet: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common letters: S, T, L, O, U, etc.

We should form a word that places R, N, E in their possible positions and uses two new common letters.

Let's think of words that have R, N, E and two other letters from the unused set.

Possible words:

- We need to place R in 1,3, or 4; N in 1,2, or 5; E in 1,2, or 3.

But note: positions must be distinct.

For example, if we place E at position 1, then N cannot be at 1, etc.

Let's consider the constraints.

Also, from the feedback, we have:

In Guess 2, N was at position 3 and got ""-"", meaning N is not at 3, but we already have that.

Similarly, E at position 4 got ""-"", not at 4.

R at position 5 got ""-"", not at 5.

Now, for the third guess, we should try to cover as many possibilities as possible.

One idea is to place E at position 1, since it can be there.

Similarly, R at position 3 or 4, N at position 2 or 5.

For example:

- Position 1: E (possible for E)
- Position 2: N (possible for N)
- Then position 3: R (possible for R)
- Then positions 4 and 5: new letters.

But is ""ENR.."" a common start? Not really.

""entry"" but T and Y, and E at1, N at2, T at3, R at4, Y at5. But R at position 4 is possible, and E at1, N at2.

But ""entry"" has Y, which is less common.

Another word: ""endow"" but O and W, and E at1, N at2, D at3, O at4, W at5. But we need to include R? We don't have to include R in this guess, but since R is in the word, if we don't include it, we might not get position info. But we can choose to test other letters.

However, it might be better to include the known letters to find their positions.

Since we have three known letters, we should include them to narrow down.

Another word: ""nerdy"" but D and Y, E at position 1? ""nerdy"" is N,E,R,D,Y — positions: N at1, E at2, R at3, D at4, Y at5.

Now, check positions:

- N at position 1: possible (from N possible positions: 1,2,5)
- E at position 2: possible (E can be 1,2,3)
- R at position 3: possible (R can be 1,3,4)

But in this case, N is at position 1, which is new; E at position 2, new; R at position 3, new.

Also, introduces D and Y.

But Y is less common; maybe not ideal.

Another word: ""hover"" but no N? Missing N.

We need to include N? Not necessarily, but if we don't, we won't get info on N's position.

Similarly for R and E.

But we can focus on one or two, but with three, it's tricky.

Perhaps we can use a word that has R and E, and test N separately, but let's see.

Since N can be at 1,2,5, and E at 1,2,3, they conflict at positions 1 and 2.

For example, if I place E at 1, N cannot be at 1, so N must be at 2 or 5.

Similarly, if E at 2, N cannot be at 2, so N at 1 or 5.

If E at 3, N can be at 1,2,5.

Similarly for R.

Let's list possible words with R,N,E.

For example, ""owner"": O,W,N,E,R — positions: O at1, W at2, N at3, E at4, R at5.

But E at position 4: but E cannot be at position 4 from Guess 2 feedback (E(-) at position 4). So E not at 4, so ""owner"" has E at 4, which is invalid, so avoid.

Similarly, ""under"": U,N,D,E,R — positions: U at1, N at2, D at3, E at4, R at5.

E at position 4: again, not allowed, since E not at 4.

""enter"": E,N,T,E,R — but E repeated, and positions: E at1, N at2, T at3, E at4 — E at position 4 not allowed, and also duplicate E, which might not be good if we don't know about duplicates.

But we don't know if there are duplicates, so better to avoid repeated letters for now.

""inner"" has duplicate N.

So avoid repeats.

""liner"" but L and I, but I is already out (from Guess 2, I(x)), so I not in word, cannot use I.

Letters out: C, A, M, I.

So cannot use I.

Similarly, ""honer"": H,O,N,E,R — positions: H at1, O at2, N at3, E at4, R at5.

E at position 4: not allowed.

""risen"": R,I,S,E,N — but I is out, cannot use I.

""stone"": S,T,O,N,E — positions: S at1, T at2, O at3, N at4, E at5.

But N at position 4: from Guess 1, N not at position 4, so cannot place N at 4.

Also, E at position 5: not allowed.

So not good.

""tuned"": T,U,N,E,D — positions: T at1, U at2, N at3, E at4, D at5.

E at position 4: not allowed.

""robed"": but E not in, and B,D, but we need E? ""robed"" has E? R,O,B,E,D — E at position 4, not allowed.

It's hard to find a word with E not at 4 or 5.

E can be at 1,2,3.

Similarly, N not at 3 or 4, so at 1,2,5.

R not at 2 or 5, so at 1,3,4.

So let's try to place E at position 1.

Then word starts with E.

Then N can be at position 2 or 5.

R can be at position 3 or 4.

For example, E at 1, N at 2, then R at 3 or 4.

If R at 3, then positions 4 and 5 new letters.

Word: e n r ? ?

Like ""enrol"" but O and L, positions: E1, N2, R3, O4, L5.

Now, check: E at1: good, N at2: possible (N can be at2), R at3: possible (R can be at3), O and L new.

But N at position 2: is that allowed? From constraints, N can be at 1,2,5, so position 2 is fine.

Similarly, R at position 3 is fine.

E at position 1 is fine.

""enrol"" is a word? Or ""enroll"" is 6 letters. ""entry"" we had, but Y.

""endow"" no R.

Another: ""enjoy"" but J and Y, and O? E,N,J,O,Y — no R.

We need R in the word? Not necessarily for the guess, but since R is in the secret, if we don't include it, we won't get feedback on its position.

Similarly for N and E.

But in this case, for ""enrol"", we include E and N, but not R. R is missing.

""enrol"" has E,N,R,O,L — R is at position 3.

""enrol"" is E,N,R,O,L — yes, R at 3.

L at 5.

O at 4.

So it includes R.

""enrol"" is a valid word.

But let's confirm: positions: 1:E, 2:N, 3:R, 4:O, 5:L

Now, for N: at position 2. From constraints, N can be at 1,2,5, so 2 is possible.

E at 1: possible.

R at 3: possible.

O and L new.

Also, O is a vowel, common.

But we have E already, so O might be another vowel or not.

Another word: ""ebony"" but B,O,N,E,Y — N at position 4? ""ebony"" is E,B,O,N,Y — positions: E1,B2,O3,N4,Y5.

N at position 4: but N cannot be at position 4 from Guess 1, so invalid placement.

Not good.

""ounce"" but C out, and U,N,C,E — C not in word.

C is out.

""angel"" but A out.

So ""enrol"" seems reasonable.

But ""enrol"" might be less common; perhaps ""enter"" but E at4 not allowed and duplicate? ""enter"" has two E's.

""onset"" O,N,S,E,T — positions: O1,N2,S3,E4,T5.

E at position 4: not allowed.

""inert"" but I out.

I is out.

""unset"" U,N,S,E,T — E at4 not allowed.

""outer"" O,U,T,E,R — positions: O1,U2,T3,E4,R5 — E at4 not allowed.

So back to ""enrol"".

Another possibility: place E at position 3.

E can be at 1,2,3.

If E at 3, then N can be at 1,2,5; R at 1,3,4 but position 3 is taken, so R at 1 or 4.

For example, word with E at 3: ? ? E ? ?

If R at 1, then R ? E ? ?

Then N at 2 or 5.

If N at 2: R N E ? ?

Like ""rune s"" but not a word. ""runes"" is 5 letters: R,U,N,E,S — positions: R1,U2,N3,E4,S5.

But E at position 4: not allowed.

""rites"" no N.

""brent"" B,R,E,N,T — positions: B1,R2,E3,N4,T5.

N at position 4: not allowed.

""trend"" T,R,E,N,D — positions: T1,R2,E3,N4,D5 — N at4 not allowed.

""spree"" duplicate E.

Hard to find.

Place N at position 1.

N at1 possible.

Then E at 1,2,3 but position 1 taken, so E at 2 or 3.

R at 1,3,4 but position 1 taken, so R at 3 or 4.

For example, N at1, E at2, R at3: N E R ? ?

Like ""nerdy"" but D and Y, and E at2, R at3.

""nerdy"": N1,E2,R3,D4,Y5.

Now, E at2: possible, R at3: possible.

But D and Y.

""nerve"" duplicate E.

""north"" no E.

""nurse"" N,U,R,S,E — positions: N1,U2,R3,S4,E5.

E at position 5: not allowed.

""noble"" no R.

So not easy.

Place N at position 5.

N at5 possible.

Then E at 1,2,3.

R at 1,3,4.

For example, E at1, R at3, N at5: E ? R ? N

Like ""earth"" but A out, and T,H.

""epoch"" no R.

""eerie"" duplicate E.

""deter"" D,E,T,E,R duplicate.

""ember"" E,M,B,E,R duplicate and M out.

M is out.

""offer"" no N.

So perhaps ""enrol"" is a decent choice.

Another word: ""rowel"" but no N or E.

We need to include E and N and R.

""renew"" duplicate E.

""renal"" R,E,N,A,L — but A out.

A not in word.

""tenor"" T,E,N,O,R — positions: T1,E2,N3,O4,R5.

Now, E at position 2: possible (E can be at 2)

N at position 3: but from Guess 2, N was at position 3 and got ""-"", meaning N is not at position 3. So N cannot be at position 3.

In ""tenor"", N is at position 3, which is forbidden, so we know it will be wrong, so not good to guess.

Similarly, in any guess, we should not place N at position 3 because we know it's not there.

Similarly, not E at position 4 or 5, not R at position 2 or 5.

So for N, cannot be at 3 or 4, so only positions 1,2,5.

For E, cannot be at 4 or 5, so only 1,2,3.

For R, cannot be at 2 or 5, so only 1,3,4.

Now, in ""tenor"", N at 3 is invalid, so avoid.

Similarly, back to ""enrol"": E at1, N at2, R at3, O at4, L at5.

N at position 2: allowed (since N can be at 1,2,5)

R at position 3: allowed (R can be at 1,3,4)

E at position 1: allowed.

And positions are all new for the letters.

So I think it's a good guess.

Perhaps ""ebbed"" but duplicate and B, E at1, B2,B3,E4,D5 — E at4 not allowed.

Not good.

""adobe"" A out.

So I'll go with ""enrol"".

But ""enrol"" might be spelled with one L, and it's valid.

To use more common letters, but O and L are common.

Another word: ""stone"" but N at4 and E at5 not allowed.

""shone"" same issue.

""alone"" A out.

""prone"" P,R,O,N,E — positions: P1,R2,O3,N4,E5.

R at position 2: but R cannot be at position 2 from Guess 1, so invalid.

N at4 invalid, E at5 invalid.

Not good.

""crony"" C out.

So ""enrol"" seems fine.

Perhaps ""grown"" no E.

I think we should use ""enrol"".

But let's confirm the feedback.

In Guess 2, we have N at position 3 got ""-"", so N not at 3.

In ""enrol"", N is at position 2, which is different.

Similarly.

Another option: ""rouen"" R,O,U,E,N — positions: R1,O2,U3,E4,N5.

But E at position 4: not allowed, and N at position 5: possible, but E at4 invalid.

Not good.

""urine"" U,R,I,N,E — but I out.

I not in word.

""drone"" D,R,O,N,E — positions: D1,R2,O3,N4,E5.

R at2 invalid, N at4 invalid, E at5 invalid.

Not good.

So I think ""enrol"" is a reasonable choice.

<guess>enrol</guess>

But let's spell it: E-N-R-O-L.

Yes.

Perhaps ""enrol"" is not very common; ""renal"" but A out.

""tenet"" duplicate.

I think it's ok.

So for the third guess, I'll go with ""enrol"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)**  
  This means:  
  - C and A are not in the secret word.  
  - R, N, and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions:  
    - R is not in position 2.  
    - N is not in position 4.  
    - E is not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: ""miner"" → Feedback: M(x) I(x) N(-) E(-) R(-)**  
  This means:  
  - M and I are not in the secret word.  
  - N, E, and R are in the secret word but in the wrong positions:  
    - N is not in position 3.  
    - E is not in position 4.  
    - R is not in position 5.  

### Combined Information:
- **Confirmed absent letters:** C, A, M, I (cannot be used).  
- **Confirmed present letters:** R, N, E (must be included in the guess).  
- **Position constraints:**  
  - R cannot be in positions 2 or 5. Possible positions: 1, 3, or 4.  
  - N cannot be in positions 3 or 4. Possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.  
  - E cannot be in positions 4 or 5. Possible positions: 1, 2, or 3.  
- The secret word has 5 letters, so we need to find two additional unknown letters (not C, A, M, I).  

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- Reuse the confirmed letters (R, N, E) in new positions that fit the constraints to narrow down their locations.  
- Introduce two new, common letters to test for their presence and positions.  
- Avoid positions that are already ruled out for R, N, and E.  
- Choose a valid 5-letter word that maximizes information.  

### Chosen Guess: ""enrol""
- **Breakdown of ""enrol"":**  
  - Position 1: E (E is possible here, as E can be in position 1, 2, or 3).  
  - Position 2: N (N is possible here, as N can be in position 1, 2, or 5).  
  - Position 3: R (R is possible here, as R can be in position 1, 3, or 4).  
  - Position 4: O (new letter, not tested before).  
  - Position 5: L (new letter, not tested before).  
- **Why ""enrol""?**  
  - It places R, N, and E in positions that are all new and allowed based on feedback (e.g., E not in 4/5, N not in 3/4, R not in 2/5).  
  - It tests two new common letters (O and L) that could be part of the secret word.  
  - It is a valid English word (meaning: to enroll or register).  
- **Expected outcomes:**  
  - If E is correct in position 1, it will be marked ""✓"".  
  - If N is correct in position 2, it will be marked ""✓"".  
  - If R is correct in position 3, it will be marked ""✓"".  
  - O and L will provide new feedback (e.g., ""✓"" if correct, ""-"" if present but wrong position, or ""x"" if absent).  

This guess efficiently repositions the known letters while exploring new possibilities.

<guess>enrol</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: miner -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(-) E(-) R(-)
Guess 3: enrol -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(-) R(✓) O(x) L(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
- C and A are absent.
- R, N, E are present but not in positions 2, 4, and 5 respectively.

Guess 2: ""miner"" -> M(x) I(x) N(-) E(-) R(-)
- M and I are absent.
- N, E, R are present but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively.

Guess 3: ""enrol"" -> E(-) N(-) R(✓) O(x) L(x)
- E is present but not in position 1 (since E(-) at position 1).
- N is present but not in position 2 (since N(-) at position 2).
- R is correct at position 3 (R(✓)).
- O and L are absent.

Now, combining all information:

Absent letters: C, A, M, I, O, L
Present letters: R, N, E (from all guesses) and we have R fixed at position 3.

Since R is correct at position 3, we know:
- The secret word has R in the third position.

Now, for E and N:
- E is present but not in position 1 (from Guess 3), not in position 4 (from Guess 2), and not in position 5 (from Guess 1). So E cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5. The only possible positions left for E are 2 or 3. But position 3 is taken by R, so E must be in position 2.

Let's list possible positions for E:
- From Guess 1: E not in position 5.
- From Guess 2: E not in position 4.
- From Guess 3: E not in position 1.
- Also, E cannot be in position 3 because that's where R is (and fixed).
- So the only position left for E is position 2.

Similarly, for N:
- From Guess 1: N not in position 4.
- From Guess 2: N not in position 3.
- From Guess 3: N not in position 2.
- Also, position 3 is taken by R, so N cannot be there.
- Possible positions for N: 1 or 5 (since 2,3,4 are ruled out).

So N must be in position 1 or 5.

Now, the secret word has:
- Position 3: R (fixed)
- Position 2: E (we just deduced, but let's confirm)

We have E must be in position 2 because:
- E is present and cannot be in 1,3,4,5 -> only 2 left.

Similarly, N must be in 1 or 5.

Now, the word has two more letters: positions 1, 4, and 5, but N will take one of 1 or 5, and the other two positions are for new letters.

Specifically:
- If N is at position 1, then positions 4 and 5 are for two new letters.
- If N is at position 5, then positions 1 and 4 are for two new letters.

But we also know that the word has exactly 5 letters, and we have R and E fixed at 3 and 2, and N at 1 or 5.

Now, from the feedback, we have absent letters: C, A, M, I, O, L.

So we need to choose a word that:
- Has E at position 2 (since we are sure it must be there? Not yet, but let's see)

Actually, we haven't confirmed E at position 2 by feedback, but by process of elimination. We should test it.

But in the guess, we can set E at position 2 to confirm.

Similarly, we need to test N at position 1 or 5.

But let's form the word.

We know position 2 must be E (because no other position possible for E).

Position 3 is R.

So the word is: _ E R _ _

Now, N must be at position 1 or 5.

We also need to fill the remaining positions with new letters, avoiding absent letters.

Absent letters: C, A, M, I, O, L

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common letters: S, T, D, H, U, etc.

Now, for the fourth guess, we can try to set N at position 1 and see.

If we set N at position 1, then word: N E R _ _

We need to fill positions 4 and 5 with two new letters.

Possible words: ""nerdy"" but D and Y, and Y is less common, and L is out but D is new.

""nerds"": N,E,R,D,S — positions: N1,E2,R3,D4,S5

But we don't know if D and S are in the word.

Similarly, ""nerdy"" is N,E,R,D,Y.

But let's see if we can cover both cases.

Since N could be at 5, we might set N at 5 to test.

But let's think strategically.

We can set E at position 2 and R at position 3, and then for position 1, we can put a new letter, and position 5 put N, and position 4 put another new letter, for example.

But we need to form a valid word.

List possible words with pattern _ E R _ _

With N in position 1 or 5.

First, if N at position 1: words like ""nerdy"", ""nerds"", ""nerka"" (not common), ""nerol"" but O and L out.

O and L are absent, so cannot use.

""berth"" B,E,R,T,H — but no N, so if N is at position 1, we must have N there.

If we assume N at position 1, then the word starts with N, then E,R, so ""NER..""

Common words: ""nerve"" but E repeated and V, but E at position 2 and 5? ""nerve"" is N,E,R,V,E — but E at position 5 is not allowed (from feedback, E not at 5), and also duplicate E.

""nerds"" is good: N,E,R,D,S

""nerdy"" N,E,R,D,Y

""nertz"" not common.

""nervy"" N,E,R,V,Y — but E at2, R at3, V at4, Y at5.

Now, V and Y are possible.

But we have to avoid O and L, etc.

If N at position 5, then word: _ E R _ N

Common words: ""stern"" S,T,E,R,N — positions: S1,T2,E3? No, we need E at position 2.

Pattern: position 2 is E, position 3 is R, position 5 is N.

So: ? E R ? N

Words: ""beryn"" not word.

""derby"" but Y, and positions: D1,E2,R3,B4,Y5 — but we need N at position 5, but here Y at5.

""fermn"" not word.

""germn"" not.

""heron"" H,E,R,O,N — but O is absent, and O at position 4.

""jern"" not 5 letters.

""pern"" not.

""terns"" T,E,R,N,S — positions: T1,E2,R3,N4,S5 — but N at position 4? But from feedback, N cannot be at position 4 (Guess 1: N not at 4). So if we place N at position 4, it would be invalid, but in this word ""terns"", N is at position 4, which is forbidden.

Similarly, ""ferns"" F,E,R,N,S — N at4.

Not allowed.

""kerne"" K,E,R,N,E — duplicate E and N at4.

""verse"" no N.

""werns"" not common.

""yearn"" Y,E,A,R,N — but A absent.

""zeron"" not.

So it seems difficult to find a word with N at position 5 and E at2, R at3.

Perhaps ""serin"" but I absent, and positions S1,E2,R3,I4,N5 — but I is absent, so cannot use.

I is out.

""merit"" M out, and I.

So no.

Therefore, it's more likely that N is at position 1.

So the word is N E R _ _

Now, we need to fill positions 4 and 5 with two letters from available, forming a valid word.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common words: ""nerds"" with D and S.

""nerdy"" with D and Y.

""nerka"" not common.

""nerol"" O and L out.

""berth"" but no N at1? ""berth"" is B,E,R,T,H — no N, but we need N at1.

If we have N at1, it must be included.

So ""nerds"" is a good candidate.

""nerdy"" is also common.

But let's see if we can get more information.

Since we have to guess, and we are not sure about N at1, but from deduction, N must be at1 or5, and 5 is hard, so probably at1.

In the guess, we can set N at1 and E at2 and R at3, and then test two new letters.

For example, ""nerds"" tests D and S.

""nerdy"" tests D and Y.

S is more common than Y, so ""nerds"" might be better.

But we also have position 4 and 5.

Another word: ""nerka"" not common.

""jerky"" J,E,R,K,Y — but no N at1.

We need N at1.

So ""nerds"" or ""nerdy"".

Perhaps ""nerve"" but E at5 not allowed and duplicate.

Not possible.

So I think ""nerds"" is a valid choice.

But in ""nerds"", positions: N1, E2, R3, D4, S5.

Now, we know E must be at position 2? We deduced it, but let's see if the feedback confirms.

In this guess, if we set E at position 2, and if it is correct, we get ✓, else if not, we get - but we think it must be there.

Similarly, R at3 is fixed, so ✓.

N at1: if correct, ✓, if not, then N must be at5, but we will see.

But in this case, for the fourth guess, we can use ""nerds"".

But let's see if there is a word that tests both possibilities, but it's hard.

Another idea: since position 1 could be N or another letter, but we know N must be at1 or5, so if we set position 1 to a new letter, and position 5 to N, but we couldn't find a word.

For example, ""? E R ? N"" with ? not N, but we need a word.

""avern"" A out.

""beryn"" not word.

""derby"" not N at5.

""ferny"" F,E,R,N,Y — positions: F1,E2,R3,N4,Y5 — but N at position 4 not allowed.

""heron"" O out.

""peril"" I and L out.

""seron"" not.

""teryn"" not.

""verge"" no N.

So no common words with pattern ? E R ? N.

Therefore, the only possibility is N at position 1, so the word is N E R _ _

Thus, for the guess, we can use ""nerds"" to test D and S.

If we get feedback that N at1 is correct, E at2 correct, R at3 correct, then we only need to find the last two letters.

But in this case, for position 4 and 5.

In ""nerds"", we have D and S at4 and5.

But we can also consider other words like ""nerdy"", but S is more common.

""nerd"" is not 5 letters.

""terms"" but T,E,R,M,S — M out, and no N.

Not.

""germs"" G,E,R,M,S — M out.

""herbs"" H,E,R,B,S — no N.

So ""nerds"" seems best.

Perhaps ""nerka"" but not common.

I think ""nerds"" is fine.

So for the fourth guess, I'll go with ""nerds"".### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

Based on the feedback from previous guesses, here's the analysis:

1. **Absent Letters (x):** C, A, M, I, O, L (from all feedback).
2. **Present Letters:**
   - R, N, E are confirmed to be in the word (from multiple guesses).
   - R is fixed in position 3 (from Guess 3: R(✓)).
3. **Position Constraints for E:**
   - E cannot be in position 1 (Guess 3: E(-) at position 1).
   - E cannot be in position 4 (Guess 2: E(-) at position 4).
   - E cannot be in position 5 (Guess 1: E(-) at position 5).
   - Since position 3 is occupied by R, the only possible position left for E is position 2.
4. **Position Constraints for N:**
   - N cannot be in position 2 (Guess 3: N(-) at position 2).
   - N cannot be in position 3 (Guess 2: N(-) at position 3).
   - N cannot be in position 4 (Guess 1: N(-) at position 4).
   - Possible positions for N are 1 or 5 (since positions 2, 3, and 4 are ruled out).
5. **Word Structure:**
   - Position 2 must be E (deduced from constraints).
   - Position 3 is R (fixed).
   - N must be in position 1 or 5.
   - The remaining positions (4 and 5 if N is at 1, or 1 and 4 if N is at 5) must be filled with new letters not yet tested and not absent.
6. **Testing Strategy:**
   - Since no valid common words exist for the pattern `? E R ? N` (e.g., N at position 5) without using absent letters (like O, I, L), N is likely in position 1.
   - Thus, the word pattern is `N E R _ _`.
   - For positions 4 and 5, introduce new common letters to test for presence/position. Absent letters (C, A, M, I, O, L) must be avoided.
   - ""nerds"" is a valid word that fits: N at position 1 (tests if N is correct here), E at position 2 (expected to be correct), R at position 3 (fixed), and introduces D and S (common untested letters).

**Why ""nerds""?**
- Confirms E at position 2 (if correct, it will be ""✓""; if not, it rules out position 2, but deduction suggests it must be here).
- Tests N at position 1 (if ""✓"", N is confirmed; if ""-"", N must be at position 5).
- Tests new letters D and S for positions 4 and 5.
- Uses common letters and avoids absent ones.

In ""crane"", E is at position 5, but feedback shows E is wrong position, so in secret word, E is not at position 5, but could be elsewhere. In ""liner"", if E is at position 5, but secret E not at 5, so not suitable.\n\nIf I guess ""liner"", and E is at 5, but if secret has E not at 5, that might not be good, but in this case, since E must be elsewhere, guessing a word with E at 5 would give feedback, but it might be inefficient if E is fixed elsewhere.\n\nI should avoid placing E at position 5 again, similarly for others.\n\nLet me consider possible positions:\n\nFrom feedback:\n\n- R cannot be at position 2. Possible positions for R: 1,3,4,5\n\n- N cannot be at position 4. Possible: 1,2,3,5\n\n- E cannot be at position 5. Possible: 1,2,3,4\n\nAlso, since R, N, E are all in the word, and word has two more letters.\n\nNow, for the new guess, I need to choose positions for R,N,E and two other letters.\n\nI should choose common letters not yet tried. C and A are out, so avoid them.\n\nLetters not tried: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nVowels: I,O,U are possible; consonants: many.\n\nSince E is already a vowel, perhaps others are consonants.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nTo maximize information, a good approach is to include letters that are common and not yet tested.\n\nBut in this case, we already know R,N,E are present, so I should focus on finding their positions and testing new letters.\n\nStandard advice in Wordle is to reuse the present letters but in new positions to find their locations.\n\nSo, for the second guess, I should create a word that includes R,N,E, but in positions different from before.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- R not at 2\n\n- N not at 4\n\n- E not at 5\n\nAnd introduce new letters.\n\nLet me think of words with R,N,E.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""rinse"": positions: R at 1, I at 2, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5. But E is at position 5, which is forbidden because from feedback, E cannot be at position 5. So guessing ""rinse"" would have E at position 5, which we know is wrong, so it\'s inefficient; we might waste that position.\n\nSimilarly, if I guess E at 5, I know it will be wrong, so better to place E elsewhere.\n\nFor example:\n- ""reign"": R at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5. Now, positions: R at position 1 (was not position 1 before, but no feedback against position 1 yet), E at position 2 (previously not tested there), N at position 5 (previously not position 4, but position 5 is new).\n\nIn ""crane"", we only know that R is not at 2, N not at 4, E not at 5. Position 1 could have R or something else.\n\nIn ""reign"":\n- Position 1: R\n- Position 2: E\n- Position 3: I (new)\n- Position 4: G (new)\n- Position 5: N\n\nN at position 5: previously, N was at position 4 and wrong, so position 5 could be possible for N.\n\nE at position 2: previously E was at position 5 and wrong, so position 2 could be possible.\n\nSimilarly, R at position 1: previously R was at position 2 and wrong, so position 1 could be correct or wrong position.\n\nThis seems reasonable.\n\nAnother word: ""nerve"" but has E twice and R repeat, might not be ideal.\n\n""hinge"" – has H,I,N,G,E – position 5 is E, but E cannot be at 5, so avoid.\n\n""miner"" – M,I,N,E,R – positions: M at 1, I at 2, N at 3, E at 4, R at 5. N at position 3, E at position 4 (not 5), R at position 5. Possible.\n\nLet\'s list:\n\n- ""reign"" : R at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5\n\n- ""inter"" : I at 1, N at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5. E at position 4.\n\n- ""inert"" : similar to inter but with T, I,N,E,R,T? ""inert"" is I,N,E,R,T positions: I at1, N at2, E at3, R at4, T at5. But N at position 2? Previously N was not at position 4, but position 2 could be possible.\n\nPossible candidates:\n\n- ""reign"" : R,E,I,G,N — with E at position 2 and N at position 5.\n\n""reign"" might not be the most common word, but it\'s valid.\n\n- ""mince"" — but C is out! C is not in word, avoid C.\n\nC is confirmed not in word, so don\'t use C.\n\nSimilarly, A not in word.\n\nSo, letters to avoid: C, A.\n\n""miner"" : M,I,N,E,R — no C or A.\n\nPositions: M at1, I at2, N at3, E at4, R at5.\n\nThen:\n- Position 1: M new\n- Position 2: I new\n- Position 3: N — previously N was at position 4 and wrong; position 3 is new for N\n- Position 4: E — previously E was at position 5 and wrong; position 4 is new for E\n- Position 5: R — previously R was at position 2 and wrong; position 5 is new for R\n\nAll positions for R,N,E are new, and we introduce M and I.\n\nThis seems good.\n\nAnother one: ""liner"" : L,I,N,E,R — N at3, E at4, R at5 — E at position 4, not 5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut ""liner"" has L and I new.\n\n""miner"" might be better because of common letters.\n\nPerhaps ""point"" but no E? But we must include E because it\'s in the word. No, we know E is in the word, so the guess must include E to gather more position info, but we can choose not to include it if we want to test other letters, but since we know it\'s in, better to include it to pin its position.\n\nStandard strategy is to include confirmed letters in new positions.\n\nSimilarly for R and N.\n\nSo yes.\n\nOther words: ""bakes"" but A is invalid, and K,S new, but no R or N? Must include R,N,E? Not necessarily, but if I don\'t include them, I might not get position info.\n\nFor example, I could guess a word with entirely new letters to test new ones, leaving R,N,E positions unknown later.\n\nBut that might be less efficient because I have three known letters.\n\nTypically, it\'s better to reposition the known present letters.\n\nSo I think ""miner"" is a good choice.\n\n"" reign"" and ""miner"", both fine.\n\n""inter"" : I,N,T,E,R — positions: I at1, N at2, T at3, E at4, R at5\n\nN at position 2: possible, no feedback against position 2 for N.\n\nSimilarly E at4, R at5.\n\nIntroducing I and T.\n\nI is a common vowel.\n\nLet\'s decide: I\'ll go with ""miner"" for now.\n\nBut ""miner"" has N at position 3 and E at position 4.\n\nIn the secret word, R must be placed: if not in position 2, and in this guess, if I have R at position 5, etc.\n\nAnother word: ""rouse"" — R,O,U,S,E — but E at position 5 again, which is invalid position for E, so avoid.\n\nSimilarly, ""serve"" E at end.\n\nAvoid any E at position 5.\n\nAlso, N not at position 4, so avoid placing N at position 4.\n\nIn my guess, I shouldn\'t place N at position 4 or E at position 5, because I know those are wrong.\n\nIn ""miner"", I placed N at position 3, E at position 4 — position 3 and 4 are both different from previous.\n\nPrevious: N was at position 4, now I place at position 3; E was at position 5, now at position 4; R was at position 2, now at position 5. All different positions.\n\nGood.\n\nSimilarly in ""inter"": N at position 2, E at 4, R at 5.\n\nPosition 2 for N: possible, since N was at position 4 before and wrong, but position 2 could be correct.\n\nNo restriction.\n\nI think ""miner"" is fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the word is valid. Yes.\n\nPerhaps I can consider ""shine"" but no R? ""shine"" has S,H,I,N,E — missing R.\n\nMust include R? Not necessarily, but if I guess ""shine"", I test S,H,I,N,E with N at position 4? Position 4: but N cannot be at position 4 from previous feedback? In ""crane"", N at position 4 was wrong, so if I guess ""shine"" with N at position 4, it will be wrong, wasted opportunity.\n\nIn ""shine"": positions: S at1, H at2, I at3, N at4, E at5\n\nN at position 4: we know from feedback that position 4 is not N, so guessing N at position 4 will definitely get ""x"" or ""-"" but since we know it\'s wrong position, if it\'s ""-"" it means N is in word but not here, which we know, or ""x"" meaning not, but we know N is in word, so if I place N at position 4, I get ""-"" meaning wrong position, which we already know, or if it mistakenly ""x"" but since N is in word, it should be ""-"" . Feedback symbol: if letter in word but wrong position, ""-""; if not in word, ""x"".\n\nSince we know N is in the word, if I place N at a wrong position, I will get ""-"", which doesn\'t give new information; it just confirms it\'s wrong, which we infer.\n\nSpecifically, if I deliberately place N at position 4, which we know is wrong, I will get ""-"" meaning it\'s still wrong position, but we already know that, so it doesn\'t help. Similarly, placing E at position 5 will get ""-"" meaning wrong position, which we know.\n\nTherefore, it\'s inefficient; better to place at new positions to possibly get ""correct"" or new info.\n\nSo, in the guess, avoid placing R at position 2, N at position 4, E at position 5.\n\nIn fact, avoid those specific positions for those letters.\n\nIn the new guess, for letters we know are present but position wrong, do not place them in positions they were before if possible; place them where they could be correct.\n\nHere, I need to place R not at 2, N not at 4, E not at 5.\n\nSo, for R: possible positions 1,3,4,5\n\nN: 1,2,3,5\n\nE: 1,2,3,4\n\nTherefore, when forming a word, I should assign positions accordingly.\n\nIn ""miner"": M at1, I at2, N at3, E at4, R at5\n\nSo R at position 5: which is allowed since previously at 2, not here.\n\nN at position 3: allowed, not position 4.\n\nE at position 4: allowed, not position 5.\n\nAlso, position 4 for E: previously E was at position 5, now position 4 might be correct.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn ""reign"": R at1, E at2, I at3, G at4, N at5\n\nE at position 2: not 5, ok.\n\nN at position 5: not 4, ok.\n\nR at position 1: not 2, ok.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nI\'ll choose ""miner"" since ""miner"" has common consonants.\n\nAnother option: ""point"" no, must have E? No, but E is in word, so better include.\n\nTo be efficient.\n\nI\'ll go with ""miner"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n\n- C and A are not in the secret word (both marked ""x"").\n- R, N, and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions:\n  - R cannot be in position 2.\n  - N cannot be in position 4.\n  - E cannot be in position 5.\n- Therefore, the secret word contains R, N, and E elsewhere, along with two unknown letters.\n\nFor this second guess:\n- We need to place R, N, and E in new possible positions to narrow down their locations:\n  - R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n  - N can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n  - E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n- We should avoid using C or A, as they are confirmed not in the word.\n- The guess should introduce new, common letters to test for their presence and positions.\n- ""miner"" is a valid 5-letter word that includes R, N, and E in repositioned locations:\n  - R is at position 5 (new position, avoiding position 2).\n  - N is at position 3 (new position, avoiding position 4).\n  - E is at position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).\n- It introduces M and I, two new vowels/consonants that are common and haven\'t been tested yet.\n- This guess efficiently reuses known present letters while exploring new positions and letters.\n\n<guess>miner</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: miner -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(-) E(-) R(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C and A are not in the word.\n- R, N, E are in the word but not in positions 2, 4, and 5 respectively.\n\nGuess 2: ""miner"" -> M(x) I(x) N(-) E(-) R(-)\nMeaning:\n- M and I are not in the word.\n- N, E, R are in the word but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively.\n\nNow, combining the information:\n\nLetters not in the word: C, A, M, I\nLetters in the word: R, N, E (from both guesses)\n\nFrom Guess 1:\n- R is not in position 2.\n- N is not in position 4.\n- E is not in position 5.\n\nFrom Guess 2:\n- N is not in position 3 (since N(-) at position 3).\n- E is not in position 4 (since E(-) at position 4).\n- R is not in position 5 (since R(-) at position 5).\n\nAlso, since R, N, E are all present, and we have two more letters to find.\n\nNow, let\'s list possible positions for each:\n\nFor R:\n- Cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 1) and position 5 (from Guess 2).\n- So possible positions: 1, 3, 4.\n\nFor N:\n- Cannot be in position 4 (from Guess 1) and position 3 (from Guess 2).\n- So possible positions: 1, 2, 5.\n\nFor E:\n- Cannot be in position 5 (from Guess 1) and position 4 (from Guess 2).\n- So possible positions: 1, 2, 3.\n\nWe also know the word has 5 letters, so positions 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nNow, we need to make a new guess that includes R, N, E in the possible positions and introduces two new letters (since C,A,M,I are out, and we need to test other letters).\n\nLetters not used yet: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, O, U, etc.\n\nWe should form a word that places R, N, E in their possible positions and uses two new common letters.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have R, N, E and two other letters from the unused set.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- We need to place R in 1,3, or 4; N in 1,2, or 5; E in 1,2, or 3.\n\nBut note: positions must be distinct.\n\nFor example, if we place E at position 1, then N cannot be at 1, etc.\n\nLet\'s consider the constraints.\n\nAlso, from the feedback, we have:\n\nIn Guess 2, N was at position 3 and got ""-"", meaning N is not at 3, but we already have that.\n\nSimilarly, E at position 4 got ""-"", not at 4.\n\nR at position 5 got ""-"", not at 5.\n\nNow, for the third guess, we should try to cover as many possibilities as possible.\n\nOne idea is to place E at position 1, since it can be there.\n\nSimilarly, R at position 3 or 4, N at position 2 or 5.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Position 1: E (possible for E)\n- Position 2: N (possible for N)\n- Then position 3: R (possible for R)\n- Then positions 4 and 5: new letters.\n\nBut is ""ENR.."" a common start?

But we need to include R? We don\'t have to include R in this guess, but since R is in the word, if we don\'t include it, we might not get position info. But we can choose to test other letters.\n\nHowever, it might be better to include the known letters to find their positions.\n\nSince we have three known letters, we should include them to narrow down.\n\nAnother word: ""nerdy"" but D and Y, E at position 1? ""nerdy"" is N,E,R,D,Y — positions: N at1, E at2, R at3, D at4, Y at5.\n\nNow, check positions:\n\n- N at position 1: possible (from N possible positions: 1,2,5)\n- E at position 2: possible (E can be 1,2,3)\n- R at position 3: possible (R can be 1,3,4)\n\nBut in this case, N is at position 1, which is new; E at position 2, new; R at position 3, new.\n\nAlso, introduces D and Y.\n\nBut Y is less common; maybe not ideal.\n\nAnother word: ""hover"" but no N? Missing N.\n\nWe need to include N? Not necessarily, but if we don\'t, we won\'t get info on N\'s position.\n\nSimilarly for R and E.\n\nBut we can focus on one or two, but with three, it\'s tricky.\n\nPerhaps we can use a word that has R and E, and test N separately, but let\'s see.\n\nSince N can be at 1,2,5, and E at 1,2,3, they conflict at positions 1 and 2.\n\nFor example, if I place E at 1, N cannot be at 1, so N must be at 2 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, if E at 2, N cannot be at 2, so N at 1 or 5.\n\nIf E at 3, N can be at 1,2,5.\n\nSimilarly for R.\n\nLet\'s list possible words with R,N,E.\n\nFor example, ""owner"": O,W,N,E,R — positions: O at1, W at2, N at3, E at4, R at5.\n\nBut E at position 4: but E cannot be at position 4 from Guess 2 feedback (E(-) at position 4).

R,O,B,E,D — E at position 4, not allowed.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a word with E not at 4 or 5.\n\nE can be at 1,2,3.\n\nSimilarly, N not at 3 or 4, so at 1,2,5.\n\nR not at 2 or 5, so at 1,3,4.\n\nSo let\'s try to place E at position 1.\n\nThen word starts with E.\n\nThen N can be at position 2 or 5.\n\nR can be at position 3 or 4.\n\nFor example, E at 1, N at 2, then R at 3 or 4.\n\nIf R at 3, then positions 4 and 5 new letters.\n\nWord: e n r ? ?\n\nLike ""enrol"" but O and L, positions: E1, N2, R3, O4, L5.\n\nNow, check: E at1: good, N at2: possible (N can be at2), R at3: possible (R can be at3), O and L new.\n\nBut N at position 2: is that allowed? From constraints, N can be at 1,2,5, so position 2 is fine.\n\nSimilarly, R at position 3 is fine.\n\nE at position 1 is fine.\n\n""enrol"" is a word? Or ""enroll"" is 6 letters. ""entry"" we had, but Y.\n\n""endow"" no R.\n\nAnother: ""enjoy"" but J and Y, and O? E,N,J,O,Y — no R.\n\nWe need R in the word? Not necessarily for the guess, but since R is in the secret, if we don\'t include it, we won\'t get feedback on its position.\n\nSimilarly for N and E.\n\nBut in this case, for ""enrol"", we include E and N, but not R. R is missing.\n\n""enrol"" has E,N,R,O,L — R is at position 3.\n\n""enrol"" is E,N,R,O,L — yes, R at 3.\n\nL at 5.\n\nO at 4.\n\nSo it includes R.\n\n""enrol"" is a valid word.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: positions: 1:E, 2:N, 3:R, 4:O, 5:L\n\nNow, for N: at position 2. From constraints, N can be at 1,2,5, so 2 is possible.\n\nE at 1: possible.\n\nR at 3: possible.\n\nO and L new.\n\nAlso, O is a vowel, common.\n\nBut we have E already, so O might be another vowel or not.\n\nAnother word: ""ebony"" but B,O,N,E,Y — N at position 4? ""ebony"" is E,B,O,N,Y — positions: E1,B2,O3,N4,Y5.\n\nN at position 4: but N cannot be at position 4 from Guess 1, so invalid placement.\n\nNot good.\n\n""ounce"" but C out, and U,N,C,E — C not in word.\n\nC is out.\n\n""angel"" but A out.\n\nSo ""enrol"" seems reasonable.\n\nBut ""enrol"" might be less common; perhaps ""enter"" but E at4 not allowed and duplicate? ""enter"" has two E\'s.\n\n""onset"" O,N,S,E,T — positions: O1,N2,S3,E4,T5.\n\nE at position 4: not allowed.\n\n""inert"" but I out.\n\nI is out.\n\n""unset"" U,N,S,E,T — E at4 not allowed.\n\n""outer"" O,U,T,E,R — positions: O1,U2,T3,E4,R5 — E at4 not allowed.\n\nSo back to ""enrol"".\n\nAnother possibility: place E at position 3.\n\nE can be at 1,2,3.\n\nIf E at 3, then N can be at 1,2,5; R at 1,3,4 but position 3 is taken, so R at 1 or 4.\n\nFor example, word with E at 3: ? ? E ? ?\n\nIf R at 1, then R ? E ? ?\n\nThen N at 2 or 5.\n\nIf N at 2: R N E ? ?\n\nLike ""rune s"" but not a word.

E R ? N.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is N at position 1, so the word is N E R _ _\n\nThus, for the guess, we can use ""nerds"" to test D and S.\n\nIf we get feedback that N at1 is correct, E at2 correct, R at3 correct, then we only need to find the last two letters.\n\nBut in this case, for position 4 and 5.\n\nIn ""nerds"", we have D and S at4 and5.\n\nBut we can also consider other words like ""nerdy"", but S is more common.\n\n""nerd"" is not 5 letters.\n\n""terms"" but T,E,R,M,S — M out, and no N.\n\nNot.\n\n""germs"" G,E,R,M,S — M out.\n\n""herbs"" H,E,R,B,S — no N.\n\nSo ""nerds"" seems best.\n\nPerhaps ""nerka"" but not common.\n\nI think ""nerds"" is fine.\n\nSo for the fourth guess, I\'ll go with ""nerds"".### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\nBased on the feedback from previous guesses, here\'s the analysis:\n\n1. **Absent Letters (x):** C, A, M, I, O, L (from all feedback).\n2. **Present Letters:**\n   - R, N, E are confirmed to be in the word (from multiple guesses).\n   - R is fixed in position 3 (from Guess 3: R(✓)).\n3. **Position Constraints for E:**\n   - E cannot be in position 1 (Guess 3: E(-) at position 1).\n   - E cannot be in position 4 (Guess 2: E(-) at position 4).\n   - E cannot be in position 5 (Guess 1: E(-) at position 5).\n   - Since position 3 is occupied by R, the only possible position left for E is position 2.\n4. **Position Constraints for N:**\n   - N cannot be in position 2 (Guess 3: N(-) at position 2).\n   - N cannot be in position 3 (Guess 2: N(-) at position 3).\n   - N cannot be in position 4 (Guess 1: N(-) at position 4).\n   - Possible positions for N are 1 or 5 (since positions 2, 3, and 4 are ruled out).\n5. **Word Structure:**\n   - Position 2 must be E (deduced from constraints).\n   - Position 3 is R (fixed).\n   - N must be in position 1 or 5.\n   - The remaining positions (4 and 5 if N is at 1, or 1 and 4 if N is at 5) must be filled with new letters not yet tested and not absent.\n6. **Testing Strategy:**\n   - Since no valid common words exist for the pattern `? E R ? N` (e.g., N at position 5) without using absent letters (like O, I, L), N is likely in position 1.\n   - Thus, the word pattern is `N E R _ _`.\n   - For positions 4 and 5, introduce new common letters to test for presence/position. Absent letters (C, A, M, I, O, L) must be avoided.\n   - ""nerds"" is a valid word that fits: N at position 1 (tests if N is correct here), E at position 2 (expected to be correct), R at position 3 (fixed), and introduces D and S (common untested letters).\n\n**Why ""nerds""?**\n- Confirms E at position 2 (if correct, it will be ""✓""; if not, it rules out position 2, but deduction suggests it must be here).\n- Tests N at position 1 (if ""✓"", N is confirmed; if ""-"", N must be at position 5).\n- Tests new letters D and S for positions 4 and 5.\n- Uses common letters and avoids absent ones.\n\n<guess>nerds</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: miner -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(-) E(-) R(-)\nGuess 3: enrol -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(-) R(✓) O(x) L(x)\nGuess 4: nerds -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) E(✓) R(✓) D(✓) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
- C and A are absent.
- R, N, E are present but not in positions 2, 4, and 5 respectively.

Guess 2: ""miner"" -> M(x) I(x) N(-) E(-) R(-)
- M and I are absent.
- N, E, R are present but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively.

Guess 3: ""enrol"" -> E(-) N(-) R(✓) O(x) L(x)
- E is present but not in position 1.
- N is present but not in position 2.
- R is correct at position 3.
- O and L are absent.

Guess 4: ""nerds"" -> N(✓) E(✓) R(✓) D(✓) S(x)
- N is correct at position 1.
- E is correct at position 2.
- R is correct at position 3.
- D is correct at position 4.
- S is absent.

Now, combining all information:

- The secret word has N at position 1, E at position 2, R at position 3, and D at position 4.
- S is absent.
- The only position left is position 5, which must be a letter that is not absent and not already placed.

We know the following letters are absent: C, A, M, I, O, L, S (from the feedback).

The present letters we have: N, E, R, D, and one more for position 5.

Since the first four positions are fixed: N, E, R, D, and position 5 is unknown.

The secret word is N E R D ?

We need to find the fifth letter.

The absent letters are: C, A, M, I, O, L, S.

Also, from the previous guesses, we have used and know about R, N, E, D.

The fifth letter must be a letter not in the absent list and not already in the word (unless duplicates, but we don't have evidence of duplicates so far).

In the word, we have N, E, R, D, all distinct so far. So position 5 is a new letter.

Possible letters: all letters except the absent ones: C, A, M, I, O, L, S.

Available: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But it must form a valid English word.

Common 5-letter words ending with ""nerd"" are: only a few, like ""nerdy"" but Y is possible, but we have to check.

""nerd"" with a letter at the end.

Possible words: 
- ""nerdy"" (with Y)
- ""nerds"" but S is absent, so not possible.

Other words: ""nerd"" is the root, so ""nerdy"" is the only common one.

But are there others? Like ""nerka"" not a word.

""nerol"" but O and L absent.

So ""nerdy"" is the most common.

But let's confirm the feedback.

In Guess 4, S is absent, so position 5 cannot be S.

Also, in the word ""nerds"", S was at position 5 and got x, so S is not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word must be ""nerd"" + a letter that is not S and not absent.

But ""nerdy"" is a word.

Is there another word? Like ""nerdj"" no.

""nerdf"" no.

So likely ""nerdy"".

But we need to make sure that Y is not absent.

Y has not been tested, so it could be present.

In fact, we haven't tested Y, so it might be in the word.

But in this case, position 5 must be Y for ""nerdy"".

Perhaps other words, but ""nerd"" is typically followed by Y or S, but S is out.

""nerd"" can be part of other words? Like ""Anerd"" not, or proper nouns.

In Wordle, valid words are common nouns, etc.

So ""nerdy"" is valid.

To confirm, we can guess ""nerdy"".

But since we have only one position left, and we know all others, we can directly guess the word.

In the context, we have one guess left? We have made 4 guesses, so we have at least one more.

But we can solve it.

The secret word is almost certainly ""nerdy"".

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

Is there a word like ""nerdu""? No.

""nerdb""? No.

""nerdg""? No.

""nerdh""? No.

""nerdp""? No.

""nerdt""? ""nerdt"" not a word.

""nerdv""? No.

""nerdw""? No.

""nerdx""? No.

""nerdz""? No.

So only ""nerdy"" is a common word.

Therefore, the fifth guess should be ""nerdy"".

But in the feedback, we have D at position 4 correct, and S absent, so yes.

To be thorough, we can consider if there is a duplicate letter, but in this case, the first four are fixed, and position 5 is new, so no duplicate.

Thus, the secret word is ""nerdy"".

So for the fifth guess, we can input ""nerdy"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, the secret word has been deduced as follows:

- **Position 1**: N is correct (✓ from Guess 4: ""nerds"").
- **Position 2**: E is correct (✓ from Guess 4: ""nerds"").
- **Position 3**: R is correct (✓ from Guess 3: ""enrol"" and confirmed in Guess 4).
- **Position 4**: D is correct (✓ from Guess 4: ""nerds"").
- **Position 5**: The only remaining position. The feedback confirms S is absent (x from Guess 4), and all other letters tested (C, A, M, I, O, L) are also absent. The only common 5-letter word fitting the pattern `NERD_` is ""nerdy"", with Y in position 5.

Thus, the secret word must be **NERDY**. This guess will confirm Y in position 5 and solve the puzzle.

<guess>nerdy</guess>",nerdy,"We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
- C and A are absent.
- R, N, E are present but not in positions 2, 4, and 5 respectively.

Guess 2: ""miner"" -> M(x) I(x) N(-) E(-) R(-)
- M and I are absent.
- N, E, R are present but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively.

Guess 3: ""enrol"" -> E(-) N(-) R(✓) O(x) L(x)
- E is present but not in position 1.
- N is present but not in position 2.
- R is correct at position 3.
- O and L are absent.

Guess 4: ""nerds"" -> N(✓) E(✓) R(✓) D(✓) S(x)
- N is correct at position 1.
- E is correct at position 2.
- R is correct at position 3.
- D is correct at position 4.
- S is absent.

Now, combining all information:

- The secret word has N at position 1, E at position 2, R at position 3, and D at position 4.
- S is absent.
- The only position left is position 5, which must be a letter that is not absent and not already placed.

We know the following letters are absent: C, A, M, I, O, L, S (from the feedback).

The present letters we have: N, E, R, D, and one more for position 5.

Since the first four positions are fixed: N, E, R, D, and position 5 is unknown.

The secret word is N E R D ?

We need to find the fifth letter.

The absent letters are: C, A, M, I, O, L, S.

Also, from the previous guesses, we have used and know about R, N, E, D.

The fifth letter must be a letter not in the absent list and not already in the word (unless duplicates, but we don't have evidence of duplicates so far).

In the word, we have N, E, R, D, all distinct so far. So position 5 is a new letter.

Possible letters: all letters except the absent ones: C, A, M, I, O, L, S.

Available: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But it must form a valid English word.

Common 5-letter words ending with ""nerd"" are: only a few, like ""nerdy"" but Y is possible, but we have to check.

""nerd"" with a letter at the end.

Possible words: 
- ""nerdy"" (with Y)
- ""nerds"" but S is absent, so not possible.

Other words: ""nerd"" is the root, so ""nerdy"" is the only common one.

But are there others? Like ""nerka"" not a word.

""nerol"" but O and L absent.

So ""nerdy"" is the most common.

But let's confirm the feedback.

In Guess 4, S is absent, so position 5 cannot be S.

Also, in the word ""nerds"", S was at position 5 and got x, so S is not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word must be ""nerd"" + a letter that is not S and not absent.

But ""nerdy"" is a word.

Is there another word? Like ""nerdj"" no.

""nerdf"" no.

So likely ""nerdy"".

But we need to make sure that Y is not absent.

Y has not been tested, so it could be present.

In fact, we haven't tested Y, so it might be in the word.

But in this case, position 5 must be Y for ""nerdy"".

Perhaps other words, but ""nerd"" is typically followed by Y or S, but S is out.

""nerd"" can be part of other words? Like ""Anerd"" not, or proper nouns.

In Wordle, valid words are common nouns, etc.

So ""nerdy"" is valid.

To confirm, we can guess ""nerdy"".

But since we have only one position left, and we know all others, we can directly guess the word.

In the context, we have one guess left? We have made 4 guesses, so we have at least one more.

But we can solve it.

The secret word is almost certainly ""nerdy"".

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

Is there a word like ""nerdu""? No.

""nerdb""? No.

""nerdg""? No.

""nerdh""? No.

""nerdp""? No.

""nerdt""? ""nerdt"" not a word.

""nerdv""? No.

""nerdw""? No.

""nerdx""? No.

""nerdz""? No.

So only ""nerdy"" is a common word.

Therefore, the fifth guess should be ""nerdy"".

But in the feedback, we have D at position 4 correct, and S absent, so yes.

To be thorough, we can consider if there is a duplicate letter, but in this case, the first four are fixed, and position 5 is new, so no duplicate.

Thus, the secret word is ""nerdy"".

So for the fifth guess, we can input ""nerdy"".Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, the secret word has been deduced as follows:

- **Position 1**: N is correct (✓ from Guess 4: ""nerds"").
- **Position 2**: E is correct (✓ from Guess 4: ""nerds"").
- **Position 3**: R is correct (✓ from Guess 3: ""enrol"" and confirmed in Guess 4).
- **Position 4**: D is correct (✓ from Guess 4: ""nerds"").
- **Position 5**: The only remaining position. The feedback confirms S is absent (x from Guess 4), and all other letters tested (C, A, M, I, O, L) are also absent. The only common 5-letter word fitting the pattern `NERD_` is ""nerdy"", with Y in position 5.

Thus, the secret word must be **NERDY**. This guess will confirm Y in position 5 and solve the puzzle.",Guess 5: nerdy -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) E(✓) R(✓) D(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
