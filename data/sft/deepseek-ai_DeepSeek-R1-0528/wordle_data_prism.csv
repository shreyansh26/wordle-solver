We are at the first guess. There is no prior feedback, so we need to choose a starting word.
A good starting word in Wordle often uses common letters and has a mix of vowels and consonants.
Typically, words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", etc. are chosen to maximize information.

Considering the above, I'll choose a word that has common letters: two vowels and three distinct consonants.
Let me pick ""SLATE"": 
- S is a common consonant
- L is a common consonant
- A is a vowel
- T is a common consonant
- E is a vowel

This word covers some of the most frequent letters in English words.

Alternatively, note that the choice is arbitrary and any reasonable starting word is acceptable.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it is a known good starter.

So, my first guess is ""SLATE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""SLATE"": 
 S(-) means S is in the word but in the wrong position.
 L(x), A(x), T(x), E(x) mean these letters are not in the word at all.

 So, from this feedback:
 - The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the first position.
 - The letters L, A, T, E are absent from the secret word.

 Therefore, the secret word has the letter S in one of the positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since it's not in position 1).

 Also, we know the word does not contain: L, A, T, E.

 We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

 We need to choose a 5-letter word that:
   - Includes the letter S (because we know it's in the word) but not in the first position.
   - Does not contain L, A, T, E.
   - We want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Since S is in the word but not at the start, we can try placing S in a different position.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible. We have eliminated A, E, T, L. 
 Common vowels left: I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but we avoid for now).
 Common consonants left: R, N, C, H, D, M, P, etc.

 We also note that the word must have S in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

 We can try a word that has S in the second position? But note: we don't know the position yet, so we can try to put S in a position we haven't tried. However, in our first guess S was in position 1, so we know it's not there. We can try position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

 Since we have no other information, we might want to test other common letters.

 Let's consider a word that has S and other common letters not in the excluded list.

 Excluded: A, E, T, L, and also we know the first letter is not S (because if it were, it would have been marked correct, but it was marked as present but wrong position). So the first letter is not S and not L, A, T, E.

 Possible first letters: any consonant except L, T and vowels except A, E. So: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to maximize information. We can try a word that has S in a different position and includes other common letters.

 Example: 
   Let's try to use the letter O (a common vowel) and R, N, etc.

 One common word that comes to mind: ""ROSIN"" but let's check if it fits.

 However, note: we must avoid A, E, T, L. ""ROSIN"" has R, O, S, I, N. None of the excluded letters. And S is in the third position.

 But we don't know if O, R, I, N are in the word. This is a good candidate because it tests new letters.

 Alternatively, we could try ""SHOWN"": S in second position, and tests H, O, W, N. But W and H are less common.

 Another idea: ""COINS"" - but then S is at the end (position 5). 

 We can also consider ""SPOON"" but it has double O and we don't know if O is in the word. Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Since we have limited information, we should try to include as many new common letters as possible and avoid repeating the same letter unless necessary.

 Let me list some words that have S and avoid A, E, T, L:

 - Using O: ROSIN, COINS, SPOON, SHOPS, etc.
 - Using I: SHIPS, MINDS, etc.
 - Using U: SUGAR (but has A, which is excluded) -> not allowed.

 After eliminating A, E, T, L, the remaining common letters are: O, I, R, N, S, C, H, D, M, P, etc.

 We know S is in the word, so we can try to use S and four other new letters.

 But note: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 I think ""ROSIN"" is a good candidate:
   R, O, S, I, N -> all distinct and common.

 However, we are not sure about the position of S. We are putting S in the third position. If the secret word has S in the third position, we get a check. If not, we get a dash or an x? But we know S is in the word, so if it's not in the third, we get a dash meaning it's in another position.

 Alternatively, we can try to put S in a position that we think is likely. But without more information, we just want to test.

 Another candidate: ""SHIRE"" -> but E is excluded, so invalid.

 ""CHINS"": has H, I, N, C and S. S is at the end. This is also good.

 But note: we have to avoid E, so ""CHINS"" is valid? Yes, because E is excluded and not in the word.

 However, we don't know if the word has H, I, N, C.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ROSIN -> letters: R, O, S, I, N
 Option 2: CHINS -> letters: C, H, I, N, S

 Both are good. We can choose either.

 I'll go with ""ROSIN"" because it has O (a vowel) and R, I, N (common consonants).

 So, second guess: ROSIN

 But note: we are not sure if the word has R, O, I, N. We are testing them.

 We are also placing S in the third position. If the secret word has S in the third, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and know S is in one of the other positions (2,4,5) but we already know it's not in 1.

 Let's write it:

 Guess: ROSIN

 If the feedback shows:
   - If S is in the third position: we get a check for S.
   - Otherwise, we get a dash for S and then we know it's in 2,4,5.

 Also, we get information about R (position 1), O (position 2), I (position 4), N (position 5).

 This should help.

 Therefore, I choose ""ROSIN"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""SLATE"":
- S is in the secret word but not in position 1 (indicated by `-`).
- L, A, T, and E are not in the secret word (indicated by `x`).

Key deductions:
1. The secret word contains **S**, but it must appear in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
2. The secret word **excludes** L, A, T, and E.
3. The first letter cannot be S (since it's misplaced) and cannot be L, A, T, or E.

For the second guess:
- We need a word that includes **S** in positions 2–5.
- We must avoid L, A, T, and E entirely.
- To maximize information, prioritize common unused letters (e.g., O, I, R, N, C, H) and test new positions for S.

Selected guess: **ROSIN**  
- Places S in position 3 (testing a new position).
- Uses new common letters: R, O, I, N (all distinct and frequent).
- Avoids excluded letters (L, A, T, E).

 Possible first letters: any consonant except L, T and vowels except A, E. So: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to maximize information. We can try a word that has S in a different position and includes other common letters.

 Example: 
   Let's try to use the letter O (a common vowel) and R, N, etc.

 One common word that comes to mind: ""ROSIN"" but let's check if it fits.

 However, note: we must avoid A, E, T, L. ""ROSIN"" has R, O, S, I, N. None of the excluded letters. And S is in the third position.

 But we don't know if O, R, I, N are in the word. This is a good candidate because it tests new letters.

 Alternatively, we could try ""SHOWN"": S in second position, and tests H, O, W, N. But W and H are less common.

 Another idea: ""COINS"" - but then S is at the end (position 5). 

 We can also consider ""SPOON"" but it has double O and we don't know if O is in the word. Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Since we have limited information, we should try to include as many new common letters as possible and avoid repeating the same letter unless necessary.

 Let me list some words that have S and avoid A, E, T, L:

 - Using O: ROSIN, COINS, SPOON, SHOPS, etc.
 - Using I: SHIPS, MINDS, etc.
 - Using U: SUGAR (but has A, which is excluded) -> not allowed.

 After eliminating A, E, T, L, the remaining common letters are: O, I, R, N, S, C, H, D, M, P, etc.

 We know S is in the word, so we can try to use S and four other new letters.

 But note: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 I think ""ROSIN"" is a good candidate:
   R, O, S, I, N -> all distinct and common.

 However, we are not sure about the position of S. We are putting S in the third position. If the secret word has S in the third position, we get a check. If not, we get a dash or an x? But we know S is in the word, so if it's not in the third, we get a dash meaning it's in another position.

 Alternatively, we can try to put S in a position that we think is likely. But without more information, we just want to test.

 Another candidate: ""SHIRE"" -> but E is excluded, so invalid.

 ""CHINS"": has H, I, N, C and S. S is at the end. This is also good.

 But note: we have to avoid E, so ""CHINS"" is valid? Yes, because E is excluded and not in the word.

 However, we don't know if the word has H, I, N, C.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ROSIN -> letters: R, O, S, I, N
 Option 2: CHINS -> letters: C, H, I, N, S

 Both are good. We can choose either.

 I'll go with ""ROSIN"" because it has O (a vowel) and R, I, N (common consonants).

 So, second guess: ROSIN

 But note: we are not sure if the word has R, O, I, N. We are testing them.

 We are also placing S in the third position. If the secret word has S in the third, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and know S is in one of the other positions (2,4,5) but we already know it's not in 1.

 Let's write it:

 Guess: ROSIN

 If the feedback shows:
   - If S is in the third position: we get a check for S.
   - Otherwise, we get a dash for S and then we know it's in 2,4,5.

 Also, we get information about R (position 1), O (position 2), I (position 4), N (position 5).

 This should help.

 Therefore, I choose ""ROSIN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""SLATE"":
- S is in the secret word but not in position 1 (indicated by `-`).
- L, A, T, and E are not in the secret word (indicated by `x`).

Key deductions:
1. The secret word contains **S**, but it must appear in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
2. The secret word **excludes** L, A, T, and E.
3. The first letter cannot be S (since it's misplaced) and cannot be L, A, T, or E.

For the second guess:
- We need a word that includes **S** in positions 2–5.
- We must avoid L, A, T, and E entirely.
- To maximize information, prioritize common unused letters (e.g., O, I, R, N, C, H) and test new positions for S.

Selected guess: **ROSIN**  
- Places S in position 3 (testing a new position).
- Uses new common letters: R, O, I, N (all distinct and frequent).
- Avoids excluded letters (L, A, T, E).

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. SLATE: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x) → S is in the word but not in position 1; L, A, T, E are absent.
2. ROSIN: R(-) O(x) S(-) I(-) N(x) → R, S, I are in the word but not in their guessed positions; O and N are absent.

Deductions from feedback:
- The word contains R, S, and I (from the dashes in ROSIN).
- Absent letters: L, A, T, E, O, N (from the Xs in both guesses).
- Positions:
  - S was guessed in position 1 (SLATE) and position 3 (ROSIN) and was misplaced both times. So S cannot be in position 1 or 3. Since S must be in the word, it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
  - R was guessed in position 1 (ROSIN) and was misplaced, so R is not in position 1.
  - I was guessed in position 4 (ROSIN) and was misplaced, so I is not in position 4.

We know the word has R, S, I, and two other letters. Also, the absent letters are: L, A, T, E, O, N.

Possible positions for S: 2, 4, or 5.

We need to form a 5-letter word containing R, S, I, and avoiding L, A, T, E, O, N.

We have two more letters to guess. Since common consonants are reduced, we might consider letters like C, D, H, M, P, U, B, G, F, etc. (vowels are limited; U is still available, and sometimes Y).

We also need to avoid the positions we know are wrong: R not pos1, S not pos1 or 3, I not pos4.

For the third guess, we can try to place R, S, I in new positions and introduce two new letters.

Possible placements:
- Let's consider S in position 2: then the word has S in second position. But from the feedback, when S was in position 1 (misplaced) and position 3 (misplaced), so trying position 2 might be logical? However, we don't know, so we need to test.

Let me try to think of words with R, S, I and two other letters not in {L,A,T,E,O,N}.
Possible words: 
- Using U: for example, words like ""SIRUP"" (but S is in position 1? We know S can't be pos1). Alternatively, ""CRISP"", ""PRISM"", ""SHIRT"", etc.

But note: SHIRT? Let's check:
- S? Position must not be 1 or 3. If we put S in position 1, but we know it can't be pos1 because of the first guess. So we cannot start with S.
H is not excluded yet, so in SHIRT: S in pos1 → invalid? Because we know S isn't position 1. We must avoid pos1,3 for S.

So we need a word with S in 2,4, or5.

Similarly, R is not in pos1.

Let's try S in position 2. Then the word: _ S _ _ _

We know R and I are in the word, but we don't know where.

Also, we cannot have I in position 4 (from ROSIN feedback).

Possible words with S in position 2:
- USAGE? But A is excluded. 
- OSCAR? But O is excluded.

Avoiding excluded letters: must avoid O,N,A,E,T,L.

What about ""DISCO"" but O excluded.

Not easy. Maybe S not in position 2? Let me try S in position 4 or 5.

Position 5: _ _ _ _ S
Example words: FOCUS? O excluded. 
  CROSS? O excluded, and S double? Not sure, but double letters might be possible? But in ROSIN, we guessed one S and it was misplaced, so if there were two S's, the feedback might have shown both, but it showed only one? Wait, the feedback for ROSIN showed S(-), meaning at least one S is present and in the wrong position (position 3). If there was another S, it wouldn't necessarily show in the feedback if we didn't guess that position? But in ROSIN, we only have one S. So the word could have one or two S's? Possibly, but we don't have evidence.

But in this game, the secret word might have duplicate letters? The feedback rules don't explicitly forbid it, but let's assume it's allowed unless we have contrary evidence.

However, since we have limited letters, let's assume no duplicates for now and see.

But we don't have much.

Another idea: use the letter U, as it's a vowel still available.

Word with U: ""SUGAR"" but A,G (G allowed) but A is excluded. So not.

""QUIRK"" - but Q and K allowed? And S missing? We must include S.

We require S in the word.

List of possible words: perhaps ""CRISP"" or ""PRISM"".

For ""CRISP"": 
- C not excluded, R, I, S, P.
- Positions: C in1, R in2, I in3, S in4, P in5.

Check against feedback:
- S is in position 4: that's allowed (since possible positions 2,4,5).
- R: in pos2. But we don't know if that's correct? In ROSIN, R was guessed in pos1 and misplaced, so we don't know whether pos2 is correct until we guess.
- I: in pos3. We don't have information on pos3 for I. In ROSIN, I was in pos4 and misplaced, so pos4 is wrong for I, but pos3 is new.

Similarly, ""PRISM"": P in1, R in2, I in3, S in4, M in5.

Same pattern for I and S.

Now, we have to check if these words use only available letters: no O,N,A,E,T,L. OK.

But we don't know about C, P, M, etc.

Let's see if they fit the known placements.

Also, note: R must not be in position 1, and in ""CRISP"" and ""PRISM"", R is in position 2, which hasn't been tested. So it might be correct or misplaced? We need to test.

But we also want to test other letters.

Perhaps ""CRISP"" or ""PRISM"" would be good.

But we have feedback that might constrain. For example, in ROSIN guess, the first letter R was misplaced. So if the word were ""CRISP"", the R is in position2. Then when we guessed R in position1 (in ROSIN), it was not correct, so that dash means R is in the word but not in position1. That is consistent because R is in position2.

Similarly, for ""PRISM"": R in position2.

Now, what about S? In ""CRISP"", S is in position4. In ROSIN, we guessed S in position3 and it was misplaced, which is correct because in ""CRISP"" S is in4.

I in position3: in ""CRISP"", I is in position3. But we have no feedback against position3 for I, so it might be correct.

Similarly, in ROSIN, I was guessed in position4 and it was misplaced, which matches if the secret word has I in position3 (so position4 is wrong).

Now C: we don't have information.

So ""CRISP"" seems possible? But we need to confirm.

Another word: ""PRISM"" has the first letter P, which is not excluded. And similar.

But let's see third guess: we can guess ""CRISP"" and see.

Alternatively, we might want to test more letters.

But note, we have only S(-) in the first guess, meaning one S was present, and in ROSIN, S(-) meaning one S present (if there were two, we might have seen two dashes? But typically, feedback shows for each guessed letter independently. If the secret word has two S's, and you guess one S, then the feedback would only show one? Or show the one that is present? But the rules aren't explicit, and generally, duplicates need to be guessed separately? To keep it simple, perhaps assume no duplicates for now.

Given the feedback, since S was in position1 of SLATE and got dash, and in position3 of ROSIN and got dash, if the secret word had two S's, one of which is in a position not guessed, that S might not be reflected? Actually, the feedback marks only the guessed letters. So it's possible that there are duplicate letters. But to avoid complexity, assume unique letters until contradicted.

But in this case, if we can't find a word with unique letters, then duplicates might be considered.

So back to ""CRISP"": 
- Includes C, R, I, S, P → all distinct and not excluded.

Positions:
- Position1: C? We haven't tested C, so it might be absent? No, C is present in the word? In this guess, we are guessing C in position1.

But we don't know if C is in the word? So if the secret word doesn't have C, we get x for C.

Similarly, R is tested in position2 (previously only pos1, now position2 is new).

I in position3 (was pos4 only).

S in position4 (was pos1 and pos3).

P in position5 (new).

This guess would tell us:
- If C is in the word and at position1? Or misplaced, etc.

But we must choose a word that has R, S, I and two new letters.

Another option: ""SIRUP"" but S in position1 → not allowed. S must not be in pos1.

What about ""SPRIG""? But it has G, but in position1 it's S? Again S pos1 invalid.

""SIRUP"" spelled with S first is invalid.

Perhaps ""USUAL"" → U twice? And A excluded.

Not working.

Another word: ""MUSIC"" → M in1, U in2, S in3? But we know S cannot be in pos3? From the feedback? Wait, S was in pos3 in ROSIN and got dash, meaning it's not in pos3? So the secret word cannot have S in pos3? So we must avoid placing S in pos3.

Similarly, S cannot be in pos1 (from SLATE) or pos3 (from ROSIN). Hence S must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

In ""MUSIC"": if S is in pos3, but we know it cannot be, because in ROSIN we guessed S in pos3 and it was misplaced, meaning S is not in pos3. So it's invalid to put S in pos3.

Therefore, ""MUSIC"" has S in pos3? That would be invalid guess because we know S is not in pos3.

So we cannot guess S in pos3 anymore.

Similarly, we must not guess R in pos1, because we know it's misplaced?

But guessing a letter in the same position again would be unwise if we know it's wrong? But the rules allow it, but we wouldn't do it.

So for S, avoid positions 1 and 3.

Now, back to ""CRISP"": S in pos4, which is allowed.

Similarly, ""PRISM"": S in pos4, allowed.

Other words: ""SHIRE""? But E excluded. Invalid.

""BRIEF""? E excluded.

""DRINK""? N excluded.

""CHIRP"": C,H,I,R,P → 
- Positions: C pos1, H pos2, I pos3, R pos4, P pos5.
- S missing? We must include S.

We must include S! So ""CHIRP"" doesn't have S.

Therefore, we need a word with R, I, S and two other letters.

Possible words: CRISP, PRISM, FRISK, GRIPS, WHIRS, DICKS, etc? 

FRISK: F,R,I,S,K → 
Avoid O,N,A,E,T,L: OK.
Positions: F in1, R in2, I in3, S in4, K in5.
Avoids S in 1,3; R in2 hasn't been tested; I in3 not tested; S in4 new.

But we know R cannot be in position1? In this case, position1 is F, so that's fine.

Similarly, GRIPS: G in1, R in2, I in3, P in4? S in5? Then S is in position5, which is allowed.

PRISM: P in1, R in2, I in3, S in4, M in5.

And CRISP: C in1, R in2, I in3, S in4, P in5.

FRISK: F in1, R in2, I in3, S in4, K in5.

All are similar.

We can also try S in position2: for example, ""USERS"" but E and S duplicate? Also E excluded.

""PSYCH"" → not real word, and length.

""ASKED"" → contains A,E,D? A and E excluded.

Difficult for S in pos2.

Example: ""RSVP"" → too short.

""DISCS"" → S duplicate? and not common.

But maybe ""WHISK"": W in1, H in2, I in3, S in4, K in5 → same as FRISK but with W,H.

WHISK: W,H,I,S,K → avoiding excluded? O,N,A,E,T,L. H and K are not excluded.

Possible, but less common.

To maximize common letters, perhaps CRISP or PRISM.

I choose ""CRISP"" as the guess.

So, third guess: CRISP

But let me double-check against the feedback:
In CRISP:
- C: new letter
- R: was misplaced in ROSIN when in pos1; now we try pos2
- I: was misplaced in ROSIN when in pos4; now we try pos3
- S: was misplaced in pos1 (SLATE) and pos3 (ROSIN); now we try pos4
- P: new letter

Yes, this seems a sound approach.

If the secret word is CRISP, we might win.

If not, we get feedback.

So let's go with CRISP.

Therefore, response formatted accordingly.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **SLATE**: S is in the word (wrong position), L, A, T, E are absent.
- **ROSIN**: R, S, I are in the word (all wrong positions), O and N are absent.

Deductions:
1. **Present letters**: R, S, I (required in the next guess).
2. **Absent letters**: L, A, T, E, O, N (avoid these).
3. **Position constraints**:
   - S cannot be in position 1 or 3 (misplaced in both prior guesses), so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
   - R cannot be in position 1 (misplaced in ROSIN).
   - I cannot be in position 4 (misplaced in ROSIN).

For the next guess:
- Include R, S, I and two new letters (avoiding excluded letters).
- Test S in position 4 (a plausible untested position), R in position 2, and I in position 3.
- New letters should be common consonants/vowels not yet tested, e.g., C, P, H, M, U. Chose C and P for high frequency.
- **CRISP** fits: C (position 1), R (position 2, new for R), I (position 3, new for I), S (position 4, allowed), P (position 5). Avoids all excluded letters.

<guess>CRISP</guess>",CRISP,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. SLATE: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x) → S is in the word but not in position 1; L, A, T, E are absent.
2. ROSIN: R(-) O(x) S(-) I(-) N(x) → R, S, I are in the word but not in their guessed positions; O and N are absent.

Deductions from feedback:
- The word contains R, S, and I (from the dashes in ROSIN).
- Absent letters: L, A, T, E, O, N (from the Xs in both guesses).
- Positions:
  - S was guessed in position 1 (SLATE) and position 3 (ROSIN) and was misplaced both times. So S cannot be in position 1 or 3. Since S must be in the word, it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
  - R was guessed in position 1 (ROSIN) and was misplaced, so R is not in position 1.
  - I was guessed in position 4 (ROSIN) and was misplaced, so I is not in position 4.

We know the word has R, S, I, and two other letters. Also, the absent letters are: L, A, T, E, O, N.

Possible positions for S: 2, 4, or 5.

We need to form a 5-letter word containing R, S, I, and avoiding L, A, T, E, O, N.

We have two more letters to guess. Since common consonants are reduced, we might consider letters like C, D, H, M, P, U, B, G, F, etc. (vowels are limited; U is still available, and sometimes Y).

We also need to avoid the positions we know are wrong: R not pos1, S not pos1 or 3, I not pos4.

For the third guess, we can try to place R, S, I in new positions and introduce two new letters.

Possible placements:
- Let's consider S in position 2: then the word has S in second position. But from the feedback, when S was in position 1 (misplaced) and position 3 (misplaced), so trying position 2 might be logical? However, we don't know, so we need to test.

Let me try to think of words with R, S, I and two other letters not in {L,A,T,E,O,N}.
Possible words: 
- Using U: for example, words like ""SIRUP"" (but S is in position 1? We know S can't be pos1). Alternatively, ""CRISP"", ""PRISM"", ""SHIRT"", etc.

But note: SHIRT? Let's check:
- S? Position must not be 1 or 3. If we put S in position 1, but we know it can't be pos1 because of the first guess. So we cannot start with S.
H is not excluded yet, so in SHIRT: S in pos1 → invalid? Because we know S isn't position 1. We must avoid pos1,3 for S.

So we need a word with S in 2,4, or5.

Similarly, R is not in pos1.

Let's try S in position 2. Then the word: _ S _ _ _

We know R and I are in the word, but we don't know where.

Also, we cannot have I in position 4 (from ROSIN feedback).

Possible words with S in position 2:
- USAGE? But A is excluded. 
- OSCAR? But O is excluded.

Avoiding excluded letters: must avoid O,N,A,E,T,L.

What about ""DISCO"" but O excluded.

Not easy. Maybe S not in position 2? Let me try S in position 4 or 5.

Position 5: _ _ _ _ S
Example words: FOCUS? O excluded. 
  CROSS? O excluded, and S double? Not sure, but double letters might be possible? But in ROSIN, we guessed one S and it was misplaced, so if there were two S's, the feedback might have shown both, but it showed only one? Wait, the feedback for ROSIN showed S(-), meaning at least one S is present and in the wrong position (position 3). If there was another S, it wouldn't necessarily show in the feedback if we didn't guess that position? But in ROSIN, we only have one S. So the word could have one or two S's? Possibly, but we don't have evidence.

But in this game, the secret word might have duplicate letters? The feedback rules don't explicitly forbid it, but let's assume it's allowed unless we have contrary evidence.

However, since we have limited letters, let's assume no duplicates for now and see.

But we don't have much.

Another idea: use the letter U, as it's a vowel still available.

Word with U: ""SUGAR"" but A,G (G allowed) but A is excluded. So not.

""QUIRK"" - but Q and K allowed? And S missing? We must include S.

We require S in the word.

List of possible words: perhaps ""CRISP"" or ""PRISM"".

For ""CRISP"": 
- C not excluded, R, I, S, P.
- Positions: C in1, R in2, I in3, S in4, P in5.

Check against feedback:
- S is in position 4: that's allowed (since possible positions 2,4,5).
- R: in pos2. But we don't know if that's correct? In ROSIN, R was guessed in pos1 and misplaced, so we don't know whether pos2 is correct until we guess.
- I: in pos3. We don't have information on pos3 for I. In ROSIN, I was in pos4 and misplaced, so pos4 is wrong for I, but pos3 is new.

Similarly, ""PRISM"": P in1, R in2, I in3, S in4, M in5.

Same pattern for I and S.

Now, we have to check if these words use only available letters: no O,N,A,E,T,L. OK.

But we don't know about C, P, M, etc.

Let's see if they fit the known placements.

Also, note: R must not be in position 1, and in ""CRISP"" and ""PRISM"", R is in position 2, which hasn't been tested. So it might be correct or misplaced? We need to test.

But we also want to test other letters.

Perhaps ""CRISP"" or ""PRISM"" would be good.

But we have feedback that might constrain. For example, in ROSIN guess, the first letter R was misplaced. So if the word were ""CRISP"", the R is in position2. Then when we guessed R in position1 (in ROSIN), it was not correct, so that dash means R is in the word but not in position1. That is consistent because R is in position2.

Similarly, for ""PRISM"": R in position2.

Now, what about S? In ""CRISP"", S is in position4. In ROSIN, we guessed S in position3 and it was misplaced, which is correct because in ""CRISP"" S is in4.

I in position3: in ""CRISP"", I is in position3. But we have no feedback against position3 for I, so it might be correct.

Similarly, in ROSIN, I was guessed in position4 and it was misplaced, which matches if the secret word has I in position3 (so position4 is wrong).

Now C: we don't have information.

So ""CRISP"" seems possible? But we need to confirm.

Another word: ""PRISM"" has the first letter P, which is not excluded. And similar.

But let's see third guess: we can guess ""CRISP"" and see.

Alternatively, we might want to test more letters.

But note, we have only S(-) in the first guess, meaning one S was present, and in ROSIN, S(-) meaning one S present (if there were two, we might have seen two dashes? But typically, feedback shows for each guessed letter independently. If the secret word has two S's, and you guess one S, then the feedback would only show one? Or show the one that is present? But the rules aren't explicit, and generally, duplicates need to be guessed separately? To keep it simple, perhaps assume no duplicates for now.

Given the feedback, since S was in position1 of SLATE and got dash, and in position3 of ROSIN and got dash, if the secret word had two S's, one of which is in a position not guessed, that S might not be reflected? Actually, the feedback marks only the guessed letters. So it's possible that there are duplicate letters. But to avoid complexity, assume unique letters until contradicted.

But in this case, if we can't find a word with unique letters, then duplicates might be considered.

So back to ""CRISP"": 
- Includes C, R, I, S, P → all distinct and not excluded.

Positions:
- Position1: C? We haven't tested C, so it might be absent? No, C is present in the word? In this guess, we are guessing C in position1.

But we don't know if C is in the word? So if the secret word doesn't have C, we get x for C.

Similarly, R is tested in position2 (previously only pos1, now position2 is new).

I in position3 (was pos4 only).

S in position4 (was pos1 and pos3).

P in position5 (new).

This guess would tell us:
- If C is in the word and at position1? Or misplaced, etc.

But we must choose a word that has R, S, I and two new letters.

Another option: ""SIRUP"" but S in position1 → not allowed. S must not be in pos1.

What about ""SPRIG""? But it has G, but in position1 it's S? Again S pos1 invalid.

""SIRUP"" spelled with S first is invalid.

Perhaps ""USUAL"" → U twice? And A excluded.

Not working.

Another word: ""MUSIC"" → M in1, U in2, S in3? But we know S cannot be in pos3? From the feedback? Wait, S was in pos3 in ROSIN and got dash, meaning it's not in pos3? So the secret word cannot have S in pos3? So we must avoid placing S in pos3.

Similarly, S cannot be in pos1 (from SLATE) or pos3 (from ROSIN). Hence S must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

In ""MUSIC"": if S is in pos3, but we know it cannot be, because in ROSIN we guessed S in pos3 and it was misplaced, meaning S is not in pos3. So it's invalid to put S in pos3.

Therefore, ""MUSIC"" has S in pos3? That would be invalid guess because we know S is not in pos3.

So we cannot guess S in pos3 anymore.

Similarly, we must not guess R in pos1, because we know it's misplaced?

But guessing a letter in the same position again would be unwise if we know it's wrong? But the rules allow it, but we wouldn't do it.

So for S, avoid positions 1 and 3.

Now, back to ""CRISP"": S in pos4, which is allowed.

Similarly, ""PRISM"": S in pos4, allowed.

Other words: ""SHIRE""? But E excluded. Invalid.

""BRIEF""? E excluded.

""DRINK""? N excluded.

""CHIRP"": C,H,I,R,P → 
- Positions: C pos1, H pos2, I pos3, R pos4, P pos5.
- S missing? We must include S.

We must include S! So ""CHIRP"" doesn't have S.

Therefore, we need a word with R, I, S and two other letters.

Possible words: CRISP, PRISM, FRISK, GRIPS, WHIRS, DICKS, etc? 

FRISK: F,R,I,S,K → 
Avoid O,N,A,E,T,L: OK.
Positions: F in1, R in2, I in3, S in4, K in5.
Avoids S in 1,3; R in2 hasn't been tested; I in3 not tested; S in4 new.

But we know R cannot be in position1? In this case, position1 is F, so that's fine.

Similarly, GRIPS: G in1, R in2, I in3, P in4? S in5? Then S is in position5, which is allowed.

PRISM: P in1, R in2, I in3, S in4, M in5.

And CRISP: C in1, R in2, I in3, S in4, P in5.

FRISK: F in1, R in2, I in3, S in4, K in5.

All are similar.

We can also try S in position2: for example, ""USERS"" but E and S duplicate? Also E excluded.

""PSYCH"" → not real word, and length.

""ASKED"" → contains A,E,D? A and E excluded.

Difficult for S in pos2.

Example: ""RSVP"" → too short.

""DISCS"" → S duplicate? and not common.

But maybe ""WHISK"": W in1, H in2, I in3, S in4, K in5 → same as FRISK but with W,H.

WHISK: W,H,I,S,K → avoiding excluded? O,N,A,E,T,L. H and K are not excluded.

Possible, but less common.

To maximize common letters, perhaps CRISP or PRISM.

I choose ""CRISP"" as the guess.

So, third guess: CRISP

But let me double-check against the feedback:
In CRISP:
- C: new letter
- R: was misplaced in ROSIN when in pos1; now we try pos2
- I: was misplaced in ROSIN when in pos4; now we try pos3
- S: was misplaced in pos1 (SLATE) and pos3 (ROSIN); now we try pos4
- P: new letter

Yes, this seems a sound approach.

If the secret word is CRISP, we might win.

If not, we get feedback.

So let's go with CRISP.

Therefore, response formatted accordingly.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **SLATE**: S is in the word (wrong position), L, A, T, E are absent.
- **ROSIN**: R, S, I are in the word (all wrong positions), O and N are absent.

Deductions:
1. **Present letters**: R, S, I (required in the next guess).
2. **Absent letters**: L, A, T, E, O, N (avoid these).
3. **Position constraints**:
   - S cannot be in position 1 or 3 (misplaced in both prior guesses), so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
   - R cannot be in position 1 (misplaced in ROSIN).
   - I cannot be in position 4 (misplaced in ROSIN).

For the next guess:
- Include R, S, I and two new letters (avoiding excluded letters).
- Test S in position 4 (a plausible untested position), R in position 2, and I in position 3.
- New letters should be common consonants/vowels not yet tested, e.g., C, P, H, M, U. Chose C and P for high frequency.
- **CRISP** fits: C (position 1), R (position 2, new for R), I (position 3, new for I), S (position 4, allowed), P (position 5). Avoids all excluded letters.",Guess 3: CRISP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) P(-),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are at the first guess. There is no prior feedback, so we need to choose a starting word.
A good starting word in Wordle often uses common letters and has a mix of vowels and consonants.
Typically, words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", etc. are chosen to maximize information.

Considering the above, I'll choose a word that has common letters: two vowels and three distinct consonants.
Let me pick ""SLATE"": 
- S is a common consonant
- L is a common consonant
- A is a vowel
- T is a common consonant
- E is a vowel

This word covers some of the most frequent letters in English words.

Alternatively, note that the choice is arbitrary and any reasonable starting word is acceptable.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it is a known good starter.

So, my first guess is ""SLATE"".I'm starting my first guess without any prior feedback. For the initial guess in Wordle, it's beneficial to use a word with common letters to gather information. A good strategy is to include frequent vowels and consonants to maximize the chances of hitting letters in the secret word. 

I choose ""SLATE"" because:
- It includes two common vowels (A and E).
- It has three common consonants (S, L, T).
- All letters are distinct, increasing the likelihood of uncovering multiple positions or letters.
- It's a known effective starter in Wordle-based games.

This guess will provide feedback on the presence and position of these letters, helping narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>SLATE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""SLATE"": 
 S(-) means S is in the word but in the wrong position.
 L(x), A(x), T(x), E(x) mean these letters are not in the word at all.

 So, from this feedback:
 - The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the first position.
 - The letters L, A, T, E are absent from the secret word.

 Therefore, the secret word has the letter S in one of the positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since it's not in position 1).

 Also, we know the word does not contain: L, A, T, E.

 We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

 We need to choose a 5-letter word that:
   - Includes the letter S (because we know it's in the word) but not in the first position.
   - Does not contain L, A, T, E.
   - We want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Since S is in the word but not at the start, we can try placing S in a different position.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible. We have eliminated A, E, T, L. 
 Common vowels left: I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but we avoid for now).
 Common consonants left: R, N, C, H, D, M, P, etc.

 We also note that the word must have S in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

 We can try a word that has S in the second position? But note: we don't know the position yet, so we can try to put S in a position we haven't tried. However, in our first guess S was in position 1, so we know it's not there. We can try position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

 Since we have no other information, we might want to test other common letters.

 Let's consider a word that has S and other common letters not in the excluded list.

 Excluded: A, E, T, L, and also we know the first letter is not S (because if it were, it would have been marked correct, but it was marked as present but wrong position). So the first letter is not S and not L, A, T, E.

 Possible first letters: any consonant except L, T and vowels except A, E. So: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to maximize information. We can try a word that has S in a different position and includes other common letters.

 Example: 
   Let's try to use the letter O (a common vowel) and R, N, etc.

 One common word that comes to mind: ""ROSIN"" but let's check if it fits.

 However, note: we must avoid A, E, T, L. ""ROSIN"" has R, O, S, I, N. None of the excluded letters. And S is in the third position.

 But we don't know if O, R, I, N are in the word. This is a good candidate because it tests new letters.

 Alternatively, we could try ""SHOWN"": S in second position, and tests H, O, W, N. But W and H are less common.

 Another idea: ""COINS"" - but then S is at the end (position 5). 

 We can also consider ""SPOON"" but it has double O and we don't know if O is in the word. Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Since we have limited information, we should try to include as many new common letters as possible and avoid repeating the same letter unless necessary.

 Let me list some words that have S and avoid A, E, T, L:

 - Using O: ROSIN, COINS, SPOON, SHOPS, etc.
 - Using I: SHIPS, MINDS, etc.
 - Using U: SUGAR (but has A, which is excluded) -> not allowed.

 After eliminating A, E, T, L, the remaining common letters are: O, I, R, N, S, C, H, D, M, P, etc.

 We know S is in the word, so we can try to use S and four other new letters.

 But note: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 I think ""ROSIN"" is a good candidate:
   R, O, S, I, N -> all distinct and common.

 However, we are not sure about the position of S. We are putting S in the third position. If the secret word has S in the third position, we get a check. If not, we get a dash or an x? But we know S is in the word, so if it's not in the third, we get a dash meaning it's in another position.

 Alternatively, we can try to put S in a position that we think is likely. But without more information, we just want to test.

 Another candidate: ""SHIRE"" -> but E is excluded, so invalid.

 ""CHINS"": has H, I, N, C and S. S is at the end. This is also good.

 But note: we have to avoid E, so ""CHINS"" is valid? Yes, because E is excluded and not in the word.

 However, we don't know if the word has H, I, N, C.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ROSIN -> letters: R, O, S, I, N
 Option 2: CHINS -> letters: C, H, I, N, S

 Both are good. We can choose either.

 I'll go with ""ROSIN"" because it has O (a vowel) and R, I, N (common consonants).

 So, second guess: ROSIN

 But note: we are not sure if the word has R, O, I, N. We are testing them.

 We are also placing S in the third position. If the secret word has S in the third, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and know S is in one of the other positions (2,4,5) but we already know it's not in 1.

 Let's write it:

 Guess: ROSIN

 If the feedback shows:
   - If S is in the third position: we get a check for S.
   - Otherwise, we get a dash for S and then we know it's in 2,4,5.

 Also, we get information about R (position 1), O (position 2), I (position 4), N (position 5).

 This should help.

 Therefore, I choose ""ROSIN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""SLATE"":
- S is in the secret word but not in position 1 (indicated by `-`).
- L, A, T, and E are not in the secret word (indicated by `x`).

Key deductions:
1. The secret word contains **S**, but it must appear in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
2. The secret word **excludes** L, A, T, and E.
3. The first letter cannot be S (since it's misplaced) and cannot be L, A, T, or E.

For the second guess:
- We need a word that includes **S** in positions 2–5.
- We must avoid L, A, T, and E entirely.
- To maximize information, prioritize common unused letters (e.g., O, I, R, N, C, H) and test new positions for S.

Selected guess: **ROSIN**  
- Places S in position 3 (testing a new position).
- Uses new common letters: R, O, I, N (all distinct and frequent).
- Avoids excluded letters (L, A, T, E).

<guess>ROSIN</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROSIN -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) S(-) I(-) N(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. SLATE: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x) → S is in the word but not in position 1; L, A, T, E are absent.
2. ROSIN: R(-) O(x) S(-) I(-) N(x) → R, S, I are in the word but not in their guessed positions; O and N are absent.

Deductions from feedback:
- The word contains R, S, and I (from the dashes in ROSIN).
- Absent letters: L, A, T, E, O, N (from the Xs in both guesses).
- Positions:
  - S was guessed in position 1 (SLATE) and position 3 (ROSIN) and was misplaced both times. So S cannot be in position 1 or 3. Since S must be in the word, it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
  - R was guessed in position 1 (ROSIN) and was misplaced, so R is not in position 1.
  - I was guessed in position 4 (ROSIN) and was misplaced, so I is not in position 4.

We know the word has R, S, I, and two other letters. Also, the absent letters are: L, A, T, E, O, N.

Possible positions for S: 2, 4, or 5.

We need to form a 5-letter word containing R, S, I, and avoiding L, A, T, E, O, N.

We have two more letters to guess. Since common consonants are reduced, we might consider letters like C, D, H, M, P, U, B, G, F, etc. (vowels are limited; U is still available, and sometimes Y).

We also need to avoid the positions we know are wrong: R not pos1, S not pos1 or 3, I not pos4.

For the third guess, we can try to place R, S, I in new positions and introduce two new letters.

Possible placements:
- Let's consider S in position 2: then the word has S in second position. But from the feedback, when S was in position 1 (misplaced) and position 3 (misplaced), so trying position 2 might be logical? However, we don't know, so we need to test.

Let me try to think of words with R, S, I and two other letters not in {L,A,T,E,O,N}.
Possible words: 
- Using U: for example, words like ""SIRUP"" (but S is in position 1? We know S can't be pos1). Alternatively, ""CRISP"", ""PRISM"", ""SHIRT"", etc.

But note: SHIRT? Let's check:
- S? Position must not be 1 or 3. If we put S in position 1, but we know it can't be pos1 because of the first guess. So we cannot start with S.
H is not excluded yet, so in SHIRT: S in pos1 → invalid? Because we know S isn't position 1. We must avoid pos1,3 for S.

So we need a word with S in 2,4, or5.

Similarly, R is not in pos1.

Let's try S in position 2. Then the word: _ S _ _ _

We know R and I are in the word, but we don't know where.

Also, we cannot have I in position 4 (from ROSIN feedback).

Possible words with S in position 2:
- USAGE? But A is excluded. 
- OSCAR? But O is excluded.

Avoiding excluded letters: must avoid O,N,A,E,T,L.

What about ""DISCO"" but O excluded.

Not easy. Maybe S not in position 2? Let me try S in position 4 or 5.

Position 5: _ _ _ _ S
Example words: FOCUS? O excluded. 
  CROSS? O excluded, and S double? Not sure, but double letters might be possible? But in ROSIN, we guessed one S and it was misplaced, so if there were two S's, the feedback might have shown both, but it showed only one? Wait, the feedback for ROSIN showed S(-), meaning at least one S is present and in the wrong position (position 3). If there was another S, it wouldn't necessarily show in the feedback if we didn't guess that position? But in ROSIN, we only have one S. So the word could have one or two S's? Possibly, but we don't have evidence.

But in this game, the secret word might have duplicate letters? The feedback rules don't explicitly forbid it, but let's assume it's allowed unless we have contrary evidence.

However, since we have limited letters, let's assume no duplicates for now and see.

But we don't have much.

Another idea: use the letter U, as it's a vowel still available.

Word with U: ""SUGAR"" but A,G (G allowed) but A is excluded. So not.

""QUIRK"" - but Q and K allowed? And S missing? We must include S.

We require S in the word.

List of possible words: perhaps ""CRISP"" or ""PRISM"".

For ""CRISP"": 
- C not excluded, R, I, S, P.
- Positions: C in1, R in2, I in3, S in4, P in5.

Check against feedback:
- S is in position 4: that's allowed (since possible positions 2,4,5).
- R: in pos2. But we don't know if that's correct? In ROSIN, R was guessed in pos1 and misplaced, so we don't know whether pos2 is correct until we guess.
- I: in pos3. We don't have information on pos3 for I. In ROSIN, I was in pos4 and misplaced, so pos4 is wrong for I, but pos3 is new.

Similarly, ""PRISM"": P in1, R in2, I in3, S in4, M in5.

Same pattern for I and S.

Now, we have to check if these words use only available letters: no O,N,A,E,T,L. OK.

But we don't know about C, P, M, etc.

Let's see if they fit the known placements.

Also, note: R must not be in position 1, and in ""CRISP"" and ""PRISM"", R is in position 2, which hasn't been tested. So it might be correct or misplaced? We need to test.

But we also want to test other letters.

Perhaps ""CRISP"" or ""PRISM"" would be good.

But we have feedback that might constrain. For example, in ROSIN guess, the first letter R was misplaced. So if the word were ""CRISP"", the R is in position2. Then when we guessed R in position1 (in ROSIN), it was not correct, so that dash means R is in the word but not in position1. That is consistent because R is in position2.

Similarly, for ""PRISM"": R in position2.

Now, what about S? In ""CRISP"", S is in position4. In ROSIN, we guessed S in position3 and it was misplaced, which is correct because in ""CRISP"" S is in4.

I in position3: in ""CRISP"", I is in position3. But we have no feedback against position3 for I, so it might be correct.

Similarly, in ROSIN, I was guessed in position4 and it was misplaced, which matches if the secret word has I in position3 (so position4 is wrong).

Now C: we don't have information.

So ""CRISP"" seems possible? But we need to confirm.

Another word: ""PRISM"" has the first letter P, which is not excluded. And similar.

But let's see third guess: we can guess ""CRISP"" and see.

Alternatively, we might want to test more letters.

But note, we have only S(-) in the first guess, meaning one S was present, and in ROSIN, S(-) meaning one S present (if there were two, we might have seen two dashes? But typically, feedback shows for each guessed letter independently. If the secret word has two S's, and you guess one S, then the feedback would only show one? Or show the one that is present? But the rules aren't explicit, and generally, duplicates need to be guessed separately? To keep it simple, perhaps assume no duplicates for now.

Given the feedback, since S was in position1 of SLATE and got dash, and in position3 of ROSIN and got dash, if the secret word had two S's, one of which is in a position not guessed, that S might not be reflected? Actually, the feedback marks only the guessed letters. So it's possible that there are duplicate letters. But to avoid complexity, assume unique letters until contradicted.

But in this case, if we can't find a word with unique letters, then duplicates might be considered.

So back to ""CRISP"": 
- Includes C, R, I, S, P → all distinct and not excluded.

Positions:
- Position1: C? We haven't tested C, so it might be absent? No, C is present in the word? In this guess, we are guessing C in position1.

But we don't know if C is in the word? So if the secret word doesn't have C, we get x for C.

Similarly, R is tested in position2 (previously only pos1, now position2 is new).

I in position3 (was pos4 only).

S in position4 (was pos1 and pos3).

P in position5 (new).

This guess would tell us:
- If C is in the word and at position1? Or misplaced, etc.

But we must choose a word that has R, S, I and two new letters.

Another option: ""SIRUP"" but S in position1 → not allowed. S must not be in pos1.

What about ""SPRIG""? But it has G, but in position1 it's S? Again S pos1 invalid.

""SIRUP"" spelled with S first is invalid.

Perhaps ""USUAL"" → U twice? And A excluded.

Not working.

Another word: ""MUSIC"" → M in1, U in2, S in3? But we know S cannot be in pos3? From the feedback? Wait, S was in pos3 in ROSIN and got dash, meaning it's not in pos3? So the secret word cannot have S in pos3? So we must avoid placing S in pos3.

Similarly, S cannot be in pos1 (from SLATE) or pos3 (from ROSIN). Hence S must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

In ""MUSIC"": if S is in pos3, but we know it cannot be, because in ROSIN we guessed S in pos3 and it was misplaced, meaning S is not in pos3. So it's invalid to put S in pos3.

Therefore, ""MUSIC"" has S in pos3? That would be invalid guess because we know S is not in pos3.

So we cannot guess S in pos3 anymore.

Similarly, we must not guess R in pos1, because we know it's misplaced?

But guessing a letter in the same position again would be unwise if we know it's wrong? But the rules allow it, but we wouldn't do it.

So for S, avoid positions 1 and 3.

Now, back to ""CRISP"": S in pos4, which is allowed.

Similarly, ""PRISM"": S in pos4, allowed.

Other words: ""SHIRE""? But E excluded. Invalid.

""BRIEF""? E excluded.

""DRINK""? N excluded.

""CHIRP"": C,H,I,R,P → 
- Positions: C pos1, H pos2, I pos3, R pos4, P pos5.
- S missing? We must include S.

We must include S! So ""CHIRP"" doesn't have S.

Therefore, we need a word with R, I, S and two other letters.

Possible words: CRISP, PRISM, FRISK, GRIPS, WHIRS, DICKS, etc? 

FRISK: F,R,I,S,K → 
Avoid O,N,A,E,T,L: OK.
Positions: F in1, R in2, I in3, S in4, K in5.
Avoids S in 1,3; R in2 hasn't been tested; I in3 not tested; S in4 new.

But we know R cannot be in position1? In this case, position1 is F, so that's fine.

Similarly, GRIPS: G in1, R in2, I in3, P in4? S in5? Then S is in position5, which is allowed.

PRISM: P in1, R in2, I in3, S in4, M in5.

And CRISP: C in1, R in2, I in3, S in4, P in5.

FRISK: F in1, R in2, I in3, S in4, K in5.

All are similar.

We can also try S in position2: for example, ""USERS"" but E and S duplicate? Also E excluded.

""PSYCH"" → not real word, and length.

""ASKED"" → contains A,E,D? A and E excluded.

Difficult for S in pos2.

Example: ""RSVP"" → too short.

""DISCS"" → S duplicate? and not common.

But maybe ""WHISK"": W in1, H in2, I in3, S in4, K in5 → same as FRISK but with W,H.

WHISK: W,H,I,S,K → avoiding excluded? O,N,A,E,T,L. H and K are not excluded.

Possible, but less common.

To maximize common letters, perhaps CRISP or PRISM.

I choose ""CRISP"" as the guess.

So, third guess: CRISP

But let me double-check against the feedback:
In CRISP:
- C: new letter
- R: was misplaced in ROSIN when in pos1; now we try pos2
- I: was misplaced in ROSIN when in pos4; now we try pos3
- S: was misplaced in pos1 (SLATE) and pos3 (ROSIN); now we try pos4
- P: new letter

Yes, this seems a sound approach.

If the secret word is CRISP, we might win.

If not, we get feedback.

So let's go with CRISP.

Therefore, response formatted accordingly.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **SLATE**: S is in the word (wrong position), L, A, T, E are absent.
- **ROSIN**: R, S, I are in the word (all wrong positions), O and N are absent.

Deductions:
1. **Present letters**: R, S, I (required in the next guess).
2. **Absent letters**: L, A, T, E, O, N (avoid these).
3. **Position constraints**:
   - S cannot be in position 1 or 3 (misplaced in both prior guesses), so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
   - R cannot be in position 1 (misplaced in ROSIN).
   - I cannot be in position 4 (misplaced in ROSIN).

For the next guess:
- Include R, S, I and two new letters (avoiding excluded letters).
- Test S in position 4 (a plausible untested position), R in position 2, and I in position 3.
- New letters should be common consonants/vowels not yet tested, e.g., C, P, H, M, U. Chose C and P for high frequency.
- **CRISP** fits: C (position 1), R (position 2, new for R), I (position 3, new for I), S (position 4, allowed), P (position 5). Avoids all excluded letters.

""ROSIN"" has R, O, S, I, N. None of the excluded letters. And S is in the third position.\n\n But we don\'t know if O, R, I, N are in the word.

We are putting S in the third position. If the secret word has S in the third position, we get a check. If not, we get a dash or an x? But we know S is in the word, so if it\'s not in the third, we get a dash meaning it\'s in another position.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put S in a position that we think is likely.

We can choose either.\n\n I\'ll go with ""ROSIN"" because it has O (a vowel) and R, I, N (common consonants).\n\n So, second guess: ROSIN\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has R, O, I, N. We are testing them.\n\n We are also placing S in the third position. If the secret word has S in the third, we get a check.

So S cannot be in position 1 or 3. Since S must be in the word, it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.\n  - R was guessed in position 1 (ROSIN) and was misplaced, so R is not in position 1.\n  - I was guessed in position 4 (ROSIN) and was misplaced, so I is not in position 4.\n\nWe know the word has R, S, I, and two other letters.

But from the feedback, when S was in position 1 (misplaced) and position 3 (misplaced), so trying position 2 might be logical? However, we don\'t know, so we need to test.\n\nLet me try to think of words with R, S, I and two other letters not in {L,A,T,E,O,N}.\nPossible words: \n- Using U: for example, words like ""SIRUP"" (but S is in position 1?

If we put S in position 1, but we know it can\'t be pos1 because of the first guess. So we cannot start with S.\nH is not excluded yet, so in SHIRT: S in pos1 → invalid? Because we know S isn\'t position 1. We must avoid pos1,3 for S.\n\nSo we need a word with S in 2,4, or5.\n\nSimilarly, R is not in pos1.\n\nLet\'s try S in position 2. Then the word: _ S _ _ _\n\nWe know R and I are in the word, but we don\'t know where.\n\nAlso, we cannot have I in position 4 (from ROSIN feedback).\n\nPossible words with S in position 2:\n- USAGE? But A is excluded. \n- OSCAR? But O is excluded.\n\nAvoiding excluded letters: must avoid O,N,A,E,T,L.\n\nWhat about ""DISCO"" but O excluded.\n\nNot easy. Maybe S not in position 2? Let me try S in position 4 or 5.\n\nPosition 5: _ _ _ _ S\nExample words: FOCUS? O excluded. \n  CROSS? O excluded, and S double? Not sure, but double letters might be possible? But in ROSIN, we guessed one S and it was misplaced, so if there were two S\'s, the feedback might have shown both, but it showed only one? Wait, the feedback for ROSIN showed S(-), meaning at least one S is present and in the wrong position (position 3). If there was another S, it wouldn\'t necessarily show in the feedback if we didn\'t guess that position? But in ROSIN, we only have one S. So the word could have one or two S\'s? Possibly, but we don\'t have evidence.\n\nBut in this game, the secret word might have duplicate letters? The feedback rules don\'t explicitly forbid it, but let\'s assume it\'s allowed unless we have contrary evidence.\n\nHowever, since we have limited letters, let\'s assume no duplicates for now and see.\n\nBut we don\'t have much.\n\nAnother idea: use the letter U, as it\'s a vowel still available.\n\nWord with U: ""SUGAR"" but A,G (G allowed) but A is excluded. So not.\n\n""QUIRK"" - but Q and K allowed? And S missing? We must include S.\n\nWe require S in the word.\n\nList of possible words: perhaps ""CRISP"" or ""PRISM"".\n\nFor ""CRISP"": \n- C not excluded, R, I, S, P.\n- Positions: C in1, R in2, I in3, S in4, P in5.\n\nCheck against feedback:\n- S is in position 4: that\'s allowed (since possible positions 2,4,5).\n- R: in pos2. But we don\'t know if that\'s correct? In ROSIN, R was guessed in pos1 and misplaced, so we don\'t know whether pos2 is correct until we guess.\n- I: in pos3. We don\'t have information on pos3 for I. In ROSIN, I was in pos4 and misplaced, so pos4 is wrong for I, but pos3 is new.\n\nSimilarly, ""PRISM"": P in1, R in2, I in3, S in4, M in5.\n\nSame pattern for I and S.\n\nNow, we have to check if these words use only available letters: no O,N,A,E,T,L. OK.\n\nBut we don\'t know about C, P, M, etc.\n\nLet\'s see if they fit the known placements.\n\nAlso, note: R must not be in position 1, and in ""CRISP"" and ""PRISM"", R is in position 2, which hasn\'t been tested. So it might be correct or misplaced? We need to test.\n\nBut we also want to test other letters.\n\nPerhaps ""CRISP"" or ""PRISM"" would be good.\n\nBut we have feedback that might constrain. For example, in ROSIN guess, the first letter R was misplaced. So if the word were ""CRISP"", the R is in position2. Then when we guessed R in position1 (in ROSIN), it was not correct, so that dash means R is in the word but not in position1. That is consistent because R is in position2.\n\nSimilarly, for ""PRISM"": R in position2.\n\nNow, what about S? In ""CRISP"", S is in position4. In ROSIN, we guessed S in position3 and it was misplaced, which is correct because in ""CRISP"" S is in4.\n\nI in position3: in ""CRISP"", I is in position3. But we have no feedback against position3 for I, so it might be correct.\n\nSimilarly, in ROSIN, I was guessed in position4 and it was misplaced, which matches if the secret word has I in position3 (so position4 is wrong).\n\nNow C: we don\'t have information.\n\nSo ""CRISP"" seems possible? But we need to confirm.\n\nAnother word: ""PRISM"" has the first letter P, which is not excluded. And similar.\n\nBut let\'s see third guess: we can guess ""CRISP"" and see.\n\nAlternatively, we might want to test more letters.\n\nBut note, we have only S(-) in the first guess, meaning one S was present, and in ROSIN, S(-) meaning one S present (if there were two, we might have seen two dashes? But typically, feedback shows for each guessed letter independently. If the secret word has two S\'s, and you guess one S, then the feedback would only show one? Or show the one that is present? But the rules aren\'t explicit, and generally, duplicates need to be guessed separately? To keep it simple, perhaps assume no duplicates for now.\n\nGiven the feedback, since S was in position1 of SLATE and got dash, and in position3 of ROSIN and got dash, if the secret word had two S\'s, one of which is in a position not guessed, that S might not be reflected? Actually, the feedback marks only the guessed letters. So it\'s possible that there are duplicate letters. But to avoid complexity, assume unique letters until contradicted.\n\nBut in this case, if we can\'t find a word with unique letters, then duplicates might be considered.\n\nSo back to ""CRISP"": \n- Includes C, R, I, S, P → all distinct and not excluded.\n\nPositions:\n- Position1: C? We haven\'t tested C, so it might be absent? No, C is present in the word? In this guess, we are guessing C in position1.\n\nBut we don\'t know if C is in the word? So if the secret word doesn\'t have C, we get x for C.\n\nSimilarly, R is tested in position2 (previously only pos1, now position2 is new).\n\nI in position3 (was pos4 only).\n\nS in position4 (was pos1 and pos3).\n\nP in position5 (new).\n\nThis guess would tell us:\n- If C is in the word and at position1? Or misplaced, etc.\n\nBut we must choose a word that has R, S, I and two new letters.\n\nAnother option: ""SIRUP"" but S in position1 → not allowed. S must not be in pos1.\n\nWhat about ""SPRIG""? But it has G, but in position1 it\'s S? Again S pos1 invalid.\n\n""SIRUP"" spelled with S first is invalid.\n\nPerhaps ""USUAL"" → U twice? And A excluded.\n\nNot working.\n\nAnother word: ""MUSIC"" → M in1, U in2, S in3? But we know S cannot be in pos3? From the feedback? Wait, S was in pos3 in ROSIN and got dash, meaning it\'s not in pos3? So the secret word cannot have S in pos3? So we must avoid placing S in pos3.\n\nSimilarly, S cannot be in pos1 (from SLATE) or pos3 (from ROSIN). Hence S must be in position 2, 4, or 5.\n\nIn ""MUSIC"": if S is in pos3, but we know it cannot be, because in ROSIN we guessed S in pos3 and it was misplaced, meaning S is not in pos3. So it\'s invalid to put S in pos3.\n\nTherefore, ""MUSIC"" has S in pos3? That would be invalid guess because we know S is not in pos3.\n\nSo we cannot guess S in pos3 anymore.\n\nSimilarly, we must not guess R in pos1, because we know it\'s misplaced?\n\nBut guessing a letter in the same position again would be unwise if we know it\'s wrong? But the rules allow it, but we wouldn\'t do it.\n\nSo for S, avoid positions 1 and 3.\n\nNow, back to ""CRISP"": S in pos4, which is allowed.\n\nSimilarly, ""PRISM"": S in pos4, allowed.\n\nOther words: ""SHIRE""? But E excluded. Invalid.\n\n""BRIEF""? E excluded.\n\n""DRINK""? N excluded.\n\n""CHIRP"": C,H,I,R,P → \n- Positions: C pos1, H pos2, I pos3, R pos4, P pos5.\n- S missing? We must include S.\n\nWe must include S! So ""CHIRP"" doesn\'t have S.\n\nTherefore, we need a word with R, I, S and two other letters.\n\nPossible words: CRISP, PRISM, FRISK, GRIPS, WHIRS, DICKS, etc? \n\nFRISK: F,R,I,S,K → \nAvoid O,N,A,E,T,L: OK.\nPositions: F in1, R in2, I in3, S in4, K in5.\nAvoids S in 1,3; R in2 hasn\'t been tested; I in3 not tested; S in4 new.\n\nBut we know R cannot be in position1? In this case, position1 is F, so that\'s fine.\n\nSimilarly, GRIPS: G in1, R in2, I in3, P in4? S in5? Then S is in position5, which is allowed.\n\nPRISM: P in1, R in2, I in3, S in4, M in5.\n\nAnd CRISP: C in1, R in2, I in3, S in4, P in5.\n\nFRISK: F in1, R in2, I in3, S in4, K in5.\n\nAll are similar.\n\nWe can also try S in position2: for example, ""USERS"" but E and S duplicate? Also E excluded.\n\n""PSYCH"" → not real word, and length.\n\n""ASKED"" → contains A,E,D? A and E excluded.\n\nDifficult for S in pos2.\n\nExample: ""RSVP"" → too short.\n\n""DISCS"" → S duplicate? and not common.\n\nBut maybe ""WHISK"": W in1, H in2, I in3, S in4, K in5 → same as FRISK but with W,H.\n\nWHISK: W,H,I,S,K → avoiding excluded? O,N,A,E,T,L. H and K are not excluded.\n\nPossible, but less common.\n\nTo maximize common letters, perhaps CRISP or PRISM.\n\nI choose ""CRISP"" as the guess.\n\nSo, third guess: CRISP\n\nBut let me double-check against the feedback:\nIn CRISP:\n- C: new letter\n- R: was misplaced in ROSIN when in pos1; now we try pos2\n- I: was misplaced in ROSIN when in pos4; now we try pos3\n- S: was misplaced in pos1 (SLATE) and pos3 (ROSIN); now we try pos4\n- P: new letter\n\nYes, this seems a sound approach.\n\nIf the secret word is CRISP, we might win.\n\nIf not, we get feedback.\n\nSo let\'s go with CRISP.\n\nTherefore, response formatted accordingly.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **SLATE**: S is in the word (wrong position), L, A, T, E are absent.\n- **ROSIN**: R, S, I are in the word (all wrong positions), O and N are absent.\n\nDeductions:\n1. **Present letters**: R, S, I (required in the next guess).\n2. **Absent letters**: L, A, T, E, O, N (avoid these).\n3. **Position constraints**:\n   - S cannot be in position 1 or 3 (misplaced in both prior guesses), so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.\n   - R cannot be in position 1 (misplaced in ROSIN).\n   - I cannot be in position 4 (misplaced in ROSIN).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Include R, S, I and two new letters (avoiding excluded letters).\n- Test S in position 4 (a plausible untested position), R in position 2, and I in position 3.\n- New letters should be common consonants/vowels not yet tested, e.g., C, P, H, M, U. Chose C and P for high frequency.\n- **CRISP** fits: C (position 1), R (position 2, new for R), I (position 3, new for I), S (position 4, allowed), P (position 5).

We have feedback from three guesses:

1. SLATE: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - L, A, T, E are not in the word.

2. ROSIN: R(-) O(x) S(-) I(-) N(x)
   - R is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word, but not in position 3.
   - I is in the word, but not in position 4.
   - O and N are not in the word.

3. CRISP: C(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) P(-)
   - C is not in the word.
   - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
   - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
   - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
   - P is in the word, but not in position 5.

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

- The word has R in position 2, I in position 3, and S in position 4. So the word is: _ R I S _
- P is in the word but not in position 5.
- We know the word contains S, R, I, and P (from the feedback of CRISP: P is present but misplaced, so it must be in the word).
- Additionally, from the first guess, we know S is present (now we know it's in position 4) and from the second guess, R and I are present (now we know positions 2 and 3).

So the word has at least the letters: R, I, S, P.

But note: the word is 5 letters, so we have one more letter to find, which must be in position 1 or 5.

Also, we have the following letters excluded: L, A, T, E, O, N, C (from CRISP: C is absent).

So the first and fifth positions must be filled with letters not in the excluded set and not R, I, S, P (since positions 2,3,4 are taken by R,I,S respectively, and P is somewhere else).

The word structure: [letter1] R I S [letter5]

We know P is in the word but not in position 5, so P must be in position 1? Because positions 2,3,4 are fixed (R,I,S), and position 5 is not P. Therefore, the only position left for P is position 1.

But wait: the word has exactly 5 positions. We have:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: S
- Position 1: must be P? Because P is present and cannot be in position 5, and positions 2,3,4 are occupied by R,I,S. So P must be in position 1.

But let's check: in the feedback for CRISP, we guessed P in position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position (P(-)). That means P is in the word but not in position 5. Since the only other position available is position 1 (because 2,3,4 are fixed and correct), then P must be in position 1.

Therefore, the word is: P R I S ?

But then what about the fifth letter? We have P in position 1? Then the word is P R I S [letter5]. But we have a fifth position to fill.

And we know that P is in the word, and if it's in position 1, that's fine. But then the fifth letter must be a letter that is not excluded and not already in the word? But we don't have any duplicate letters so far.

But wait: the feedback for CRISP: we guessed C (wrong), R (correct), I (correct), S (correct), P (present but wrong position). If the word were ""PRISM"", then in CRISP we have:
- C in pos1: not in word -> x
- R in pos2: correct -> ✓
- I in pos3: correct -> ✓
- S in pos4: correct -> ✓
- P in pos5: but in ""PRISM"", P is in pos1, so it should be marked as present but not in pos5 -> which matches the dash.

But in ""PRISM"", the fifth letter is M. So the word would be P R I S M.

But we have to check if M is excluded? From previous feedback, we haven't excluded M. Also, in the second guess, we excluded O and N, but not M.

Now, is there any other possibility? What if the word has duplicate letters? For example, could there be two P's? But in CRISP, we only have one P, and it was marked as present (but wrong position). If there were two P's, and one of them is in position 1 (if the word is say, P R I S P), then when we guessed P in position 5, it might be marked as present? But the feedback only shows one P as present? Actually, the rules: if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback might show multiple indicators. But in this case, we only have one P in the guess, so it would only show one feedback for that P. So if the word has two P's, and we guess one P in the wrong position, it would still show a dash. But we don't know if there is a duplicate.

However, without evidence of duplicates, we can assume no duplicates for now.

But let's see: if the word is P R I S X, where X is the fifth letter. We know P is in the word, and if it's not in position 5, then it must be in position 1. So the word must start with P? Then the fifth letter is something else.

But in the structure, if P is in position 1, then the word is P R I S [fifth letter].

Now, what about the fifth letter? It must be a letter that is not excluded and not P (if no duplicates). Excluded letters: L, A, T, E, O, N, C.

So possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

Common words: PRISM, PRISE (but E is excluded), PRICE (C excluded), PRIDE (D? not excluded), PRIME (M? not excluded), PRIZE (Z? not excluded), etc.

But we know that P is in the word and must be in position 1? Because the only position left for P is position 1.

But wait: what if the word has five distinct letters? Then P must be in position 1.

But let me confirm: the known letters are R, I, S, and P. And we have positions 2,3,4 fixed. So the only positions left are 1 and 5. P cannot be in 5 (from feedback), so it must be in 1. Then the fifth letter is a new letter.

So the word is P R I S ?

Now, we need to guess the fifth letter. But we have to make a guess for the whole word.

We can try ""PRISM"" as a candidate.

But note: in the feedback for CRISP, we have P marked as present but not in position 5. If the word is ""PRISM"", then P is in position 1, which is consistent.

Also, we haven't tested M yet.

Alternatively, we could try ""PRIGS"" but G? But then S is at the end? But we have S in position 4, so the word would be P R I G S? But then S is in position 5? But we have S in position 4 fixed. So that would be two S's? But in ""PRIGS"", it's P-R-I-G-S, so S is only at the end. But we have position 4 fixed as S, so that would require S in both 4 and 5? But ""PRIGS"" has only one S? So it doesn't have S in position 4. Therefore, ""PRIGS"" is not possible because position 4 must be S.

Similarly, ""PRISE"" has E excluded and also S at the end.

So the only common word that fits the pattern P R I S ? is PRISM (with M) or PRISS (double S? but then we have S in position 4 and 5? but we don't know if duplicates are allowed). Also, ""PRISS"" is a word? It means to be primly precise. But let's see.

But in the feedback, when we guessed SLATE, we had S in position 1 (misplaced) and in ROSIN S in position 3 (misplaced). In CRISP, S in position 4 (correct). If the word has two S's, then in SLATE and ROSIN, we might have gotten feedback for the other S? But we didn't, because we didn't guess the position of the other S. So it's possible.

But to be safe, let's consider the common word ""PRISM"".

Another possibility: ""PRICK"" but C is excluded.

""PRINT"" but N excluded.

""PRIZE"" - Z is allowed? Yes, and not excluded.

But we have to see.

Given that we have only two possibilities for the fifth letter? Actually, many: D, F, G, H, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need to guess a word.

We can try ""PRISM"" because it's a common word.

But note: we have to make a guess. Since we have R, I, S fixed in positions 2,3,4, and P must be in position 1, then the word is P R I S X, and we need to find X.

We can try to use a word that tests a common letter for X.

But we have only one guess? No, we have 6 tries, and we are at guess 4.

We can try ""PRISM"" and see.

But let me see the feedback again: in CRISP, we have P(-) meaning P is present but not in position 5. If we put P in position 1, then it should be correct? But we haven't guessed position 1 for P yet.

In CRISP, we guessed P in position 5, so we know it's not there, but we don't know about position 1.

So if we guess ""PRISM"", then:
- Position 1: P? We haven't tested P in position 1 before. So it might be correct or not? But we know P is in the word, and if it's not in 5, and the only other position is 1, then it must be in 1.

Therefore, we can be confident that the word is P R I S M.

But let me check if there are other possibilities. What if the word has a duplicate? For example, could it be that the word is R I S P and then a duplicate of one of the letters? But we have R, I, S fixed in positions 2,3,4, so they cannot be in position 1 or 5. And P is present, so if it's not in 5, it must be in 1. So no room for duplicates? Because if we put a duplicate, say two S's, then we have S in position 4 and also in position 1 or 5. But position 1 must be P? Then position 5 must be S? So the word would be P R I S S.

Is ""PRISS"" a word? Yes, meaning to act in a prissy manner.

But in that case, when we guessed SLATE, we had S in position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. If the word is ""PRISS"", then S is in position 1? But we are putting P in position 1? Contradiction.

If the word is ""PRISS"", then:
- Position 1: P? But then S is in position 4 and 5. But in SLATE, we guessed S in position 1 and it was marked as present (dash). But in ""PRISS"", there is no S in position 1? So why would it be marked as present? Because there is an S in the word, but not in position 1? So the dash would be correct.

But in ""PRISS"", the first letter is P, not S. So when we guessed SLATE with S in position 1, it was marked as dash, meaning S is in the word but not in position 1. That matches ""PRISS"" because S is in positions 4 and 5.

Similarly, in ROSIN, we guessed S in position 3 and it was dash, which is correct because S is not in position 3.

In CRISP, we guessed S in position 4 and it was correct (✓), which matches.

And P in position 5: we guessed P in position 5 and it was dash, meaning P is present but not in position 5. In ""PRISS"", P is in position 1, so that matches.

But now, the word ""PRISS"" has two S's. Is that allowed? Wordle allows duplicate letters.

But in the feedback for CRISP, we only have one S marked as correct (position 4). But we didn't guess the other S? So that's fine.

Similarly, in SLATE and ROSIN, we only had one S in the guess, so only one feedback for S.

So both ""PRISM"" and ""PRISS"" are possible? But ""PRISS"" has S in position 5 as well.

But in the pattern, we have position 4 fixed as S, so if we have ""PRISS"", then position 5 is S.

But we don't know that yet.

We also have the letter I: in ""PRISS"", I is in position 3, which is correct.

But we need to distinguish between ""PRISM"" and ""PRISS"".

We can try to guess ""PRISM"" and see.

But we have to make a guess.

Another common word: ""PRICE"" but C excluded.

""PRIDE"": D is not excluded.

""PRIZE"": Z not excluded.

But we have to choose one.

Given that we have limited guesses, and we are at guess 4, we can try ""PRISM"".

But let me see the feedback again: in the first guess, we had S(-) meaning S is present but not in position 1. In ""PRISM"", S is in position 4, so that's fine. In ""PRISS"", S is in 4 and 5, so also fine.

In the second guess, ROSIN: we had I(-) meaning I is present but not in position 4. In both ""PRISM"" and ""PRISS"", I is in position 3, so not in 4, so that's fine.

In CRISP: we have R(✓) in position 2, I(✓) in position 3, S(✓) in position 4, and P(-) in position 5.

For ""PRISM"": P is in position 1, so when we guessed P in position 5, it's not there, so dash is correct.

For ""PRISS"": P is in position 1, so same.

Now, the only difference is the fifth letter: M for ""PRISM"" and S for ""PRISS"".

We need to find which one.

But we don't have information about the fifth letter.

We can try to guess a word that has M or S in position 5, but we have to guess the whole word.

Since we are constrained to the pattern P R I S ? and we have to choose a letter for the fifth position.

We can try ""PRISM"" as it is a common word.

But to be safe, we might consider that in the feedback, we have not seen any indication of a second S. But that doesn't mean it's not there.

Another idea: in the first guess, we had S in position 1 and it was marked as present (dash). If the word were ""PRISS"", then there is an S in position 4 and 5, but not in position 1. So the dash is correct. Similarly, if it's ""PRISM"", there is only one S in position 4, so the dash in the first guess is because of that S.

So no distinction.

We have to make a guess.

Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and the constraints:

- PRISM (M)
- PRIGS (G) -> but then position 5 is S? But we have position 4 as S, so if we put S in position 5, then it's ""PRIGS"" with G in position 4? No, the pattern is fixed: position 4 is S, so it must be P R I S ?. So ""PRIGS"" would be P R I G S, which has S in position 5, but position 4 is G, which is not S. So not possible.

The word must have S in position 4, so the fifth letter is a different letter.

So ""PRIGS"" is not possible because it would require position 4 to be G.

Similarly, ""PRICK"" has C excluded and position 4 is C? Not S.

So only words that have P R I S and then a fifth letter.

Common ones: PRISM, PRISE (E excluded), PRICE (C excluded), PRIDE, PRIZE, PRISS (double S), PRIVY (V), etc.

With excluded letters: E, C, O, N, A, T, L are out.

So possible: PRISM (M), PRIDE (D), PRIZE (Z), PRIVY (V), PRILL (L excluded? L is excluded, so no), PRINK (K? but N excluded? N is excluded, so no), PRIOR (O excluded and R duplicate), etc.

So viable options: PRISM, PRIDE, PRIZE, PRIVY.

We can try to guess one of these.

But we have P in position 1? We haven't confirmed that.

In the feedback, we know P is in the word and not in position 5, and the only position available is position 1, so it must be there.

So the first letter is P.

Therefore, we can guess ""PRISM"" for the fourth guess.

If it's not, we get feedback and then adjust.

But let's see: we have 6 guesses, so we can afford to guess.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests multiple possibilities, but it's hard because the first four letters are fixed.

The only unknown is the last letter.

So we have to guess one.

I think ""PRISM"" is a good guess.

So I'll go with that.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Consolidate Known Information from Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (SLATE)**: S is present (wrong position), L, A, T, E are absent.
   - **Guess 2 (ROSIN)**: R, S, I are present (all wrong positions), O and N are absent.
   - **Guess 3 (CRISP)**: 
     - C is absent.
     - R is correct in position 2.
     - I is correct in position 3.
     - S is correct in position 4.
     - P is present but wrong position (not position 5).
   
2. **Deductions**:
   - The secret word has the pattern: `_ R I S _` (positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed as R, I, S).
   - **Confirmed letters**: R (pos2), I (pos3), S (pos4), and P (present, but not in pos5).
   - **Absent letters**: A, C, E, L, N, O, T (from all feedback).
   - **Position constraints for P**: Since P is present but not in position 5, and positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed, P must be in position 1 (the only remaining position). Thus, the word starts with P.
   - The word structure is now: `P R I S _`.
   - The fifth letter must:
     - Be a letter not in the absent list (A, C, E, L, N, O, T).
     - Form a valid English word with ""PRIS"".
     - Possible candidates include D, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, Y, Z (common letters not yet tested or excluded).

3. **Evaluate Possible Words**:
   - Common 5-letter words fitting `P R I S _`:
     - **PRISM** (M): Highly common, M not excluded.
     - **PRIDE** (D): D not excluded, but less likely due to feedback patterns.
     - **PRIZE** (Z): Z is less common but possible.
     - **PRIVY** (V): V is less common.
     - **PRIGS** (G): Invalid, as it would require S in position 5 but position 4 is fixed as S (would imply duplicate S, which is possible but less likely here).
   - **Why PRISM?** 
     - M is a common consonant not excluded.
     - ""PRISM"" is a high-frequency word that fits all constraints.
     - Testing M resolves uncertainty efficiently (if incorrect, feedback on the fifth letter will confirm/eliminate options).

4. **Strategy for Guess 4**:
   - Guess **PRISM** to test the full pattern `P R I S M`.
   - If correct, the game is solved. If not, feedback on M (or reveal of a duplicate S) will narrow options for the next guess.

<guess>PRISM</guess>",PRISM,"We have feedback from three guesses:

1. SLATE: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - L, A, T, E are not in the word.

2. ROSIN: R(-) O(x) S(-) I(-) N(x)
   - R is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word, but not in position 3.
   - I is in the word, but not in position 4.
   - O and N are not in the word.

3. CRISP: C(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) P(-)
   - C is not in the word.
   - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
   - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
   - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
   - P is in the word, but not in position 5.

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

- The word has R in position 2, I in position 3, and S in position 4. So the word is: _ R I S _
- P is in the word but not in position 5.
- We know the word contains S, R, I, and P (from the feedback of CRISP: P is present but misplaced, so it must be in the word).
- Additionally, from the first guess, we know S is present (now we know it's in position 4) and from the second guess, R and I are present (now we know positions 2 and 3).

So the word has at least the letters: R, I, S, P.

But note: the word is 5 letters, so we have one more letter to find, which must be in position 1 or 5.

Also, we have the following letters excluded: L, A, T, E, O, N, C (from CRISP: C is absent).

So the first and fifth positions must be filled with letters not in the excluded set and not R, I, S, P (since positions 2,3,4 are taken by R,I,S respectively, and P is somewhere else).

The word structure: [letter1] R I S [letter5]

We know P is in the word but not in position 5, so P must be in position 1? Because positions 2,3,4 are fixed (R,I,S), and position 5 is not P. Therefore, the only position left for P is position 1.

But wait: the word has exactly 5 positions. We have:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: S
- Position 1: must be P? Because P is present and cannot be in position 5, and positions 2,3,4 are occupied by R,I,S. So P must be in position 1.

But let's check: in the feedback for CRISP, we guessed P in position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position (P(-)). That means P is in the word but not in position 5. Since the only other position available is position 1 (because 2,3,4 are fixed and correct), then P must be in position 1.

Therefore, the word is: P R I S ?

But then what about the fifth letter? We have P in position 1? Then the word is P R I S [letter5]. But we have a fifth position to fill.

And we know that P is in the word, and if it's in position 1, that's fine. But then the fifth letter must be a letter that is not excluded and not already in the word? But we don't have any duplicate letters so far.

But wait: the feedback for CRISP: we guessed C (wrong), R (correct), I (correct), S (correct), P (present but wrong position). If the word were ""PRISM"", then in CRISP we have:
- C in pos1: not in word -> x
- R in pos2: correct -> ✓
- I in pos3: correct -> ✓
- S in pos4: correct -> ✓
- P in pos5: but in ""PRISM"", P is in pos1, so it should be marked as present but not in pos5 -> which matches the dash.

But in ""PRISM"", the fifth letter is M. So the word would be P R I S M.

But we have to check if M is excluded? From previous feedback, we haven't excluded M. Also, in the second guess, we excluded O and N, but not M.

Now, is there any other possibility? What if the word has duplicate letters? For example, could there be two P's? But in CRISP, we only have one P, and it was marked as present (but wrong position). If there were two P's, and one of them is in position 1 (if the word is say, P R I S P), then when we guessed P in position 5, it might be marked as present? But the feedback only shows one P as present? Actually, the rules: if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback might show multiple indicators. But in this case, we only have one P in the guess, so it would only show one feedback for that P. So if the word has two P's, and we guess one P in the wrong position, it would still show a dash. But we don't know if there is a duplicate.

However, without evidence of duplicates, we can assume no duplicates for now.

But let's see: if the word is P R I S X, where X is the fifth letter. We know P is in the word, and if it's not in position 5, then it must be in position 1. So the word must start with P? Then the fifth letter is something else.

But in the structure, if P is in position 1, then the word is P R I S [fifth letter].

Now, what about the fifth letter? It must be a letter that is not excluded and not P (if no duplicates). Excluded letters: L, A, T, E, O, N, C.

So possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

Common words: PRISM, PRISE (but E is excluded), PRICE (C excluded), PRIDE (D? not excluded), PRIME (M? not excluded), PRIZE (Z? not excluded), etc.

But we know that P is in the word and must be in position 1? Because the only position left for P is position 1.

But wait: what if the word has five distinct letters? Then P must be in position 1.

But let me confirm: the known letters are R, I, S, and P. And we have positions 2,3,4 fixed. So the only positions left are 1 and 5. P cannot be in 5 (from feedback), so it must be in 1. Then the fifth letter is a new letter.

So the word is P R I S ?

Now, we need to guess the fifth letter. But we have to make a guess for the whole word.

We can try ""PRISM"" as a candidate.

But note: in the feedback for CRISP, we have P marked as present but not in position 5. If the word is ""PRISM"", then P is in position 1, which is consistent.

Also, we haven't tested M yet.

Alternatively, we could try ""PRIGS"" but G? But then S is at the end? But we have S in position 4, so the word would be P R I G S? But then S is in position 5? But we have S in position 4 fixed. So that would be two S's? But in ""PRIGS"", it's P-R-I-G-S, so S is only at the end. But we have position 4 fixed as S, so that would require S in both 4 and 5? But ""PRIGS"" has only one S? So it doesn't have S in position 4. Therefore, ""PRIGS"" is not possible because position 4 must be S.

Similarly, ""PRISE"" has E excluded and also S at the end.

So the only common word that fits the pattern P R I S ? is PRISM (with M) or PRISS (double S? but then we have S in position 4 and 5? but we don't know if duplicates are allowed). Also, ""PRISS"" is a word? It means to be primly precise. But let's see.

But in the feedback, when we guessed SLATE, we had S in position 1 (misplaced) and in ROSIN S in position 3 (misplaced). In CRISP, S in position 4 (correct). If the word has two S's, then in SLATE and ROSIN, we might have gotten feedback for the other S? But we didn't, because we didn't guess the position of the other S. So it's possible.

But to be safe, let's consider the common word ""PRISM"".

Another possibility: ""PRICK"" but C is excluded.

""PRINT"" but N excluded.

""PRIZE"" - Z is allowed? Yes, and not excluded.

But we have to see.

Given that we have only two possibilities for the fifth letter? Actually, many: D, F, G, H, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need to guess a word.

We can try ""PRISM"" because it's a common word.

But note: we have to make a guess. Since we have R, I, S fixed in positions 2,3,4, and P must be in position 1, then the word is P R I S X, and we need to find X.

We can try to use a word that tests a common letter for X.

But we have only one guess? No, we have 6 tries, and we are at guess 4.

We can try ""PRISM"" and see.

But let me see the feedback again: in CRISP, we have P(-) meaning P is present but not in position 5. If we put P in position 1, then it should be correct? But we haven't guessed position 1 for P yet.

In CRISP, we guessed P in position 5, so we know it's not there, but we don't know about position 1.

So if we guess ""PRISM"", then:
- Position 1: P? We haven't tested P in position 1 before. So it might be correct or not? But we know P is in the word, and if it's not in 5, and the only other position is 1, then it must be in 1.

Therefore, we can be confident that the word is P R I S M.

But let me check if there are other possibilities. What if the word has a duplicate? For example, could it be that the word is R I S P and then a duplicate of one of the letters? But we have R, I, S fixed in positions 2,3,4, so they cannot be in position 1 or 5. And P is present, so if it's not in 5, it must be in 1. So no room for duplicates? Because if we put a duplicate, say two S's, then we have S in position 4 and also in position 1 or 5. But position 1 must be P? Then position 5 must be S? So the word would be P R I S S.

Is ""PRISS"" a word? Yes, meaning to act in a prissy manner.

But in that case, when we guessed SLATE, we had S in position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. If the word is ""PRISS"", then S is in position 1? But we are putting P in position 1? Contradiction.

If the word is ""PRISS"", then:
- Position 1: P? But then S is in position 4 and 5. But in SLATE, we guessed S in position 1 and it was marked as present (dash). But in ""PRISS"", there is no S in position 1? So why would it be marked as present? Because there is an S in the word, but not in position 1? So the dash would be correct.

But in ""PRISS"", the first letter is P, not S. So when we guessed SLATE with S in position 1, it was marked as dash, meaning S is in the word but not in position 1. That matches ""PRISS"" because S is in positions 4 and 5.

Similarly, in ROSIN, we guessed S in position 3 and it was dash, which is correct because S is not in position 3.

In CRISP, we guessed S in position 4 and it was correct (✓), which matches.

And P in position 5: we guessed P in position 5 and it was dash, meaning P is present but not in position 5. In ""PRISS"", P is in position 1, so that matches.

But now, the word ""PRISS"" has two S's. Is that allowed? Wordle allows duplicate letters.

But in the feedback for CRISP, we only have one S marked as correct (position 4). But we didn't guess the other S? So that's fine.

Similarly, in SLATE and ROSIN, we only had one S in the guess, so only one feedback for S.

So both ""PRISM"" and ""PRISS"" are possible? But ""PRISS"" has S in position 5 as well.

But in the pattern, we have position 4 fixed as S, so if we have ""PRISS"", then position 5 is S.

But we don't know that yet.

We also have the letter I: in ""PRISS"", I is in position 3, which is correct.

But we need to distinguish between ""PRISM"" and ""PRISS"".

We can try to guess ""PRISM"" and see.

But we have to make a guess.

Another common word: ""PRICE"" but C excluded.

""PRIDE"": D is not excluded.

""PRIZE"": Z not excluded.

But we have to choose one.

Given that we have limited guesses, and we are at guess 4, we can try ""PRISM"".

But let me see the feedback again: in the first guess, we had S(-) meaning S is present but not in position 1. In ""PRISM"", S is in position 4, so that's fine. In ""PRISS"", S is in 4 and 5, so also fine.

In the second guess, ROSIN: we had I(-) meaning I is present but not in position 4. In both ""PRISM"" and ""PRISS"", I is in position 3, so not in 4, so that's fine.

In CRISP: we have R(✓) in position 2, I(✓) in position 3, S(✓) in position 4, and P(-) in position 5.

For ""PRISM"": P is in position 1, so when we guessed P in position 5, it's not there, so dash is correct.

For ""PRISS"": P is in position 1, so same.

Now, the only difference is the fifth letter: M for ""PRISM"" and S for ""PRISS"".

We need to find which one.

But we don't have information about the fifth letter.

We can try to guess a word that has M or S in position 5, but we have to guess the whole word.

Since we are constrained to the pattern P R I S ? and we have to choose a letter for the fifth position.

We can try ""PRISM"" as it is a common word.

But to be safe, we might consider that in the feedback, we have not seen any indication of a second S. But that doesn't mean it's not there.

Another idea: in the first guess, we had S in position 1 and it was marked as present (dash). If the word were ""PRISS"", then there is an S in position 4 and 5, but not in position 1. So the dash is correct. Similarly, if it's ""PRISM"", there is only one S in position 4, so the dash in the first guess is because of that S.

So no distinction.

We have to make a guess.

Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and the constraints:

- PRISM (M)
- PRIGS (G) -> but then position 5 is S? But we have position 4 as S, so if we put S in position 5, then it's ""PRIGS"" with G in position 4? No, the pattern is fixed: position 4 is S, so it must be P R I S ?. So ""PRIGS"" would be P R I G S, which has S in position 5, but position 4 is G, which is not S. So not possible.

The word must have S in position 4, so the fifth letter is a different letter.

So ""PRIGS"" is not possible because it would require position 4 to be G.

Similarly, ""PRICK"" has C excluded and position 4 is C? Not S.

So only words that have P R I S and then a fifth letter.

Common ones: PRISM, PRISE (E excluded), PRICE (C excluded), PRIDE, PRIZE, PRISS (double S), PRIVY (V), etc.

With excluded letters: E, C, O, N, A, T, L are out.

So possible: PRISM (M), PRIDE (D), PRIZE (Z), PRIVY (V), PRILL (L excluded? L is excluded, so no), PRINK (K? but N excluded? N is excluded, so no), PRIOR (O excluded and R duplicate), etc.

So viable options: PRISM, PRIDE, PRIZE, PRIVY.

We can try to guess one of these.

But we have P in position 1? We haven't confirmed that.

In the feedback, we know P is in the word and not in position 5, and the only position available is position 1, so it must be there.

So the first letter is P.

Therefore, we can guess ""PRISM"" for the fourth guess.

If it's not, we get feedback and then adjust.

But let's see: we have 6 guesses, so we can afford to guess.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests multiple possibilities, but it's hard because the first four letters are fixed.

The only unknown is the last letter.

So we have to guess one.

I think ""PRISM"" is a good guess.

So I'll go with that.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Consolidate Known Information from Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (SLATE)**: S is present (wrong position), L, A, T, E are absent.
   - **Guess 2 (ROSIN)**: R, S, I are present (all wrong positions), O and N are absent.
   - **Guess 3 (CRISP)**: 
     - C is absent.
     - R is correct in position 2.
     - I is correct in position 3.
     - S is correct in position 4.
     - P is present but wrong position (not position 5).
   
2. **Deductions**:
   - The secret word has the pattern: `_ R I S _` (positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed as R, I, S).
   - **Confirmed letters**: R (pos2), I (pos3), S (pos4), and P (present, but not in pos5).
   - **Absent letters**: A, C, E, L, N, O, T (from all feedback).
   - **Position constraints for P**: Since P is present but not in position 5, and positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed, P must be in position 1 (the only remaining position). Thus, the word starts with P.
   - The word structure is now: `P R I S _`.
   - The fifth letter must:
     - Be a letter not in the absent list (A, C, E, L, N, O, T).
     - Form a valid English word with ""PRIS"".
     - Possible candidates include D, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, Y, Z (common letters not yet tested or excluded).

3. **Evaluate Possible Words**:
   - Common 5-letter words fitting `P R I S _`:
     - **PRISM** (M): Highly common, M not excluded.
     - **PRIDE** (D): D not excluded, but less likely due to feedback patterns.
     - **PRIZE** (Z): Z is less common but possible.
     - **PRIVY** (V): V is less common.
     - **PRIGS** (G): Invalid, as it would require S in position 5 but position 4 is fixed as S (would imply duplicate S, which is possible but less likely here).
   - **Why PRISM?** 
     - M is a common consonant not excluded.
     - ""PRISM"" is a high-frequency word that fits all constraints.
     - Testing M resolves uncertainty efficiently (if incorrect, feedback on the fifth letter will confirm/eliminate options).

4. **Strategy for Guess 4**:
   - Guess **PRISM** to test the full pattern `P R I S M`.
   - If correct, the game is solved. If not, feedback on M (or reveal of a duplicate S) will narrow options for the next guess.",Guess 4: PRISM -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) M(✓),SUCCESS
