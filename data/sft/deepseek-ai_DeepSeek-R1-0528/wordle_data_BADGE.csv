We are just starting, so no feedback from previous guesses. We need to choose a good starting word.
 Common strategies include choosing words with common letters and without repeating letters to maximize information.
 Let's pick a word that has common letters: A, E, R, S, T, etc.

 I could choose ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"", but let me think of one that includes more common letters.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word that is sometimes used (meaning the profit from a company), but it may not be very common.
 Since the response format requires a valid English word, I'll pick a more common one.

 Let me go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. These are fairly common letters.

 However, note that feedback will tell us:
   - Correct position (✓)
   - Letter in word but wrong position (-)
   - Letter not in word (x)

 Since it's the first guess, any word with common letters is fine.

 Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is also a good starting word because it has two vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S).

 Let me choose ""RAISE"" as my first guess.

 After entering ""RAISE"", we'll get feedback that will help for the next guesses.

 So, first guess: RAISE

 We'll output it in the specified format.

I'm starting my first guess without any prior feedback. For the first guess, I want to maximize information by choosing a word with common letters. ""RAISE"" is a strong starter because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), covering frequent letters in English 5-letter words.

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""raise""
 Feedback: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)

 Interpretation:
 - R is not in the secret word (x)
 - A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) -> so the second letter of the secret word is A.
 - I is not in the secret word (x)
 - S is not in the secret word (x)
 - E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) -> so the fifth letter of the secret word is E.

 Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ E

 We know that R, I, S are not in the word. Also, we have used the letters: R, A, I, S, E.

 For the next guess, we must:
 1. Avoid using R, I, S (since they are absent).
 2. Include the known correct letters in their positions: second letter must be A and fifth must be E.
 3. Try to use other common letters to get more information.

 The known positions: 
   Position 2: A
   Position 5: E

 So the word pattern is: ? A ? ? E

 We need to choose a word that fits: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] E

 We also know that the word cannot contain R, I, S.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: for example, T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

 We can try to form a word that has T, N, O, L, etc.

 Some words that fit the pattern: 
   ...A ... E

 Examples:
   ""cable"": C A B L E -> but we have positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E -> but we don't know if B and L are in the word? But we are trying to test new letters.
   ""table"": T A B L E
   ""eagle"": E A G L E -> but E is already known at the end, and we are using E at the start? But we don't know about the first letter. However, note that we have not ruled out E at the beginning? But the feedback for the first guess only told us about the letters in ""raise"", and E was at the end and marked correct. But the secret word might have more than one E? We don't know.

 However, note that in the first guess, the E was at the fifth position and was correct. But the word might have another E? We don't have information about that.

 But we also know that the first guess had E at the fifth position and it was correct, so the fifth letter is E. The word might have an E at the first position? We don't know.

 However, we must avoid using R, I, S.

 Let's consider ""table"": 
   T is a new letter, A is fixed, B is new, L is new, E is fixed.

 This seems good because we test T, B, L.

 Alternatively, we could try ""cameo"" but that's 5 letters? No, ""cameo"" is 5 letters but the pattern is ?A? and then two more? Actually, we need the fifth to be E. So ""cameo"" doesn't end with E.

 Another word: ""dance"" -> D A N C E -> tests D, N, C.

 But note: we have the fifth letter as E, so it must end with E.

 Let me list some words that end with E and have A in the second position and avoid R, I, S:

   table, cable, fable, gable, sable (but S is not allowed because we know S is absent) -> avoid sable.
   dance, lance, manse (but S is absent, so avoid manse), hence dance and lance are okay? But note: we have to avoid S, so lance is okay? L-A-N-C-E.

 However, we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

 Another word: ""paste"" -> but S is absent, so we cannot use S.

 How about ""taste""? Again, S is absent.

 So avoiding R, I, S, we have:

   table, cable, fable, gable, dance, lance, pace (but pace is 4 letters? no, 4) -> 5 letter words.

 Let me check:

   table: T A B L E -> valid
   cable: C A B L E -> valid
   fable: F A B L E -> valid
   gable: G A B L E -> valid
   dance: D A N C E -> valid
   lance: L A N C E -> valid

 We can also consider:

   ""date"": too short.

   ""daze"": D A Z E -> but that's 4 letters? No, 4. We need 5: D A Z E? That's 4. So no.

   ""bake"": 4 letters.

   ""name"": N A M E -> 4 letters.

   ""plane"": P L A N E -> but the A is in the third position? We need A in the second. So no.

   ""plate"": P L A T E -> A is in the third? No.

   ""caste"": but S is absent.

   ""haste"": S is absent.

   ""latte"": L A T T E -> but T is repeated? And it ends with E. Pattern: L A T T E -> second letter A, fifth E. So that fits. But we don't know if T is in the word? And we can test T.

   ""latte"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning a type of coffee.

   But note: we are avoiding R, I, S. T is new.

 However, we have two T's? That might be less informative, but it's acceptable.

 But let's think: we want to test as many new letters as possible. So words without repeated letters are better.

 So ""table"", ""cable"", ""fable"", ""gable"", ""dance"", ""lance"" are all without repeated letters.

 We can choose one of these.

 I'll go with ""table"" because it uses T, B, L which are common.

 So the next guess: ""table""

 We expect the pattern: T A B L E

 After this, we will get feedback on T, B, L (and confirm A and E, which we already know).

 But note: we know A and E are correct and in place, so they will be marked with ✓ again.

 However, the feedback might show:
   If T is in the word and in the correct position? We don't know.
   Similarly for B and L.

 This will help us narrow down.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has letters that are more common? T is very common, B is less common. Maybe we can try ""dance"" to test D, N, C? N and C are also common.

 But since we have multiple choices, any is fine.

 Let me pick ""dance"" because it tests three new consonants: D, N, C.

 So guess: dance

 But wait, we have to consider: the first guess had A and E correct. In ""dance"", we have:
   D at position 1, A at 2 (correct), N at 3, C at 4, E at 5 (correct).

 We are testing D, N, C.

 Alternatively, we can try ""lance"" to test L, N, C? But L is also common.

 I think ""dance"" is a good choice.

 However, note that the word might have repeated letters? But we don't know.

 But to maximize information, I'll go with ""dance"".

 But let me check: we are avoiding R, I, S. ""dance"" does not contain these.

 So I choose ""dance"".

 But wait, what about the possibility of having an E at the first position? We don't know. However, in ""dance"", the first letter is D, which is new.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that has an E in the first position? But we don't have any information about that. And we are not required to test that specifically.

 Since we have two fixed letters (A and E) and we are trying to find the other three, we can focus on the first, third, and fourth positions.

 So I'll go with ""dance"".

 However, note: the word ""dance"" has the same E at the end, which we already know. So we are only testing the first, third, and fourth letters.

 But that's okay.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that has a different set of letters? 

 After consideration, I'll choose ""dance"".

 So the next guess is ""dance"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- **R, I, S** are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is **correct and in position 2** (marked ""✓"").
- **E** is **correct and in position 5** (marked ""✓"").

This means the secret word has the pattern: `_ A _ _ E`.  
For the next guess:
- Must avoid **R, I, S** entirely.
- Must retain **A** in position 2 and **E** in position 5.
- Should test new common letters (e.g., **T, N, L, C, D**) to gather more information.

A strong candidate is **""dance""**:
- Fits the pattern `_ A _ _ E` → **D** A **N** **C** E.
- Tests new letters: **D** (position 1), **N** (position 3), **C** (position 4).
- Avoids forbidden letters (R, I, S) and repeats.

<guess>dance</guess>",dance,"We are given feedback from the first guess: ""raise""
 Feedback: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)

 Interpretation:
 - R is not in the secret word (x)
 - A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) -> so the second letter of the secret word is A.
 - I is not in the secret word (x)
 - S is not in the secret word (x)
 - E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) -> so the fifth letter of the secret word is E.

 Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ E

 We know that R, I, S are not in the word. Also, we have used the letters: R, A, I, S, E.

 For the next guess, we must:
 1. Avoid using R, I, S (since they are absent).
 2. Include the known correct letters in their positions: second letter must be A and fifth must be E.
 3. Try to use other common letters to get more information.

 The known positions: 
   Position 2: A
   Position 5: E

 So the word pattern is: ? A ? ? E

 We need to choose a word that fits: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] E

 We also know that the word cannot contain R, I, S.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: for example, T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

 We can try to form a word that has T, N, O, L, etc.

 Some words that fit the pattern: 
   ...A ... E

 Examples:
   ""cable"": C A B L E -> but we have positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E -> but we don't know if B and L are in the word? But we are trying to test new letters.
   ""table"": T A B L E
   ""eagle"": E A G L E -> but E is already known at the end, and we are using E at the start? But we don't know about the first letter. However, note that we have not ruled out E at the beginning? But the feedback for the first guess only told us about the letters in ""raise"", and E was at the end and marked correct. But the secret word might have more than one E? We don't know.

 However, note that in the first guess, the E was at the fifth position and was correct. But the word might have another E? We don't have information about that.

 But we also know that the first guess had E at the fifth position and it was correct, so the fifth letter is E. The word might have an E at the first position? We don't know.

 However, we must avoid using R, I, S.

 Let's consider ""table"": 
   T is a new letter, A is fixed, B is new, L is new, E is fixed.

 This seems good because we test T, B, L.

 Alternatively, we could try ""cameo"" but that's 5 letters? No, ""cameo"" is 5 letters but the pattern is ?A? and then two more? Actually, we need the fifth to be E. So ""cameo"" doesn't end with E.

 Another word: ""dance"" -> D A N C E -> tests D, N, C.

 But note: we have the fifth letter as E, so it must end with E.

 Let me list some words that end with E and have A in the second position and avoid R, I, S:

   table, cable, fable, gable, sable (but S is not allowed because we know S is absent) -> avoid sable.
   dance, lance, manse (but S is absent, so avoid manse), hence dance and lance are okay? But note: we have to avoid S, so lance is okay? L-A-N-C-E.

 However, we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

 Another word: ""paste"" -> but S is absent, so we cannot use S.

 How about ""taste""? Again, S is absent.

 So avoiding R, I, S, we have:

   table, cable, fable, gable, dance, lance, pace (but pace is 4 letters? no, 4) -> 5 letter words.

 Let me check:

   table: T A B L E -> valid
   cable: C A B L E -> valid
   fable: F A B L E -> valid
   gable: G A B L E -> valid
   dance: D A N C E -> valid
   lance: L A N C E -> valid

 We can also consider:

   ""date"": too short.

   ""daze"": D A Z E -> but that's 4 letters? No, 4. We need 5: D A Z E? That's 4. So no.

   ""bake"": 4 letters.

   ""name"": N A M E -> 4 letters.

   ""plane"": P L A N E -> but the A is in the third position? We need A in the second. So no.

   ""plate"": P L A T E -> A is in the third? No.

   ""caste"": but S is absent.

   ""haste"": S is absent.

   ""latte"": L A T T E -> but T is repeated? And it ends with E. Pattern: L A T T E -> second letter A, fifth E. So that fits. But we don't know if T is in the word? And we can test T.

   ""latte"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning a type of coffee.

   But note: we are avoiding R, I, S. T is new.

 However, we have two T's? That might be less informative, but it's acceptable.

 But let's think: we want to test as many new letters as possible. So words without repeated letters are better.

 Alternatively, we can try ""lance"" to test L, N, C? But L is also common.

 I think ""dance"" is a good choice.

 However, note that the word might have repeated letters? But we don't know.

 But to maximize information, I'll go with ""dance"".

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are just starting, so no feedback from previous guesses. We need to choose a good starting word.
 Common strategies include choosing words with common letters and without repeating letters to maximize information.
 Let's pick a word that has common letters: A, E, R, S, T, etc.

 I could choose ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"", but let me think of one that includes more common letters.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word that is sometimes used (meaning the profit from a company), but it may not be very common.
 Since the response format requires a valid English word, I'll pick a more common one.

 Let me go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. These are fairly common letters.

 However, note that feedback will tell us:
   - Correct position (✓)
   - Letter in word but wrong position (-)
   - Letter not in word (x)

 Since it's the first guess, any word with common letters is fine.

 Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is also a good starting word because it has two vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S).

 Let me choose ""RAISE"" as my first guess.

 After entering ""RAISE"", we'll get feedback that will help for the next guesses.

 So, first guess: RAISE

 We'll output it in the specified format.I'm starting my first guess without any prior feedback. For the first guess, I want to maximize information by choosing a word with common letters. ""RAISE"" is a strong starter because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), covering frequent letters in English 5-letter words. This should provide useful feedback about letter presence and positions.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""raise""
 Feedback: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)

 Interpretation:
 - R is not in the secret word (x)
 - A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) -> so the second letter of the secret word is A.
 - I is not in the secret word (x)
 - S is not in the secret word (x)
 - E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) -> so the fifth letter of the secret word is E.

 Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ E

 We know that R, I, S are not in the word. Also, we have used the letters: R, A, I, S, E.

 For the next guess, we must:
 1. Avoid using R, I, S (since they are absent).
 2. Include the known correct letters in their positions: second letter must be A and fifth must be E.
 3. Try to use other common letters to get more information.

 The known positions: 
   Position 2: A
   Position 5: E

 So the word pattern is: ? A ? ? E

 We need to choose a word that fits: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] E

 We also know that the word cannot contain R, I, S.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: for example, T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

 We can try to form a word that has T, N, O, L, etc.

 Some words that fit the pattern: 
   ...A ... E

 Examples:
   ""cable"": C A B L E -> but we have positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E -> but we don't know if B and L are in the word? But we are trying to test new letters.
   ""table"": T A B L E
   ""eagle"": E A G L E -> but E is already known at the end, and we are using E at the start? But we don't know about the first letter. However, note that we have not ruled out E at the beginning? But the feedback for the first guess only told us about the letters in ""raise"", and E was at the end and marked correct. But the secret word might have more than one E? We don't know.

 However, note that in the first guess, the E was at the fifth position and was correct. But the word might have another E? We don't have information about that.

 But we also know that the first guess had E at the fifth position and it was correct, so the fifth letter is E. The word might have an E at the first position? We don't know.

 However, we must avoid using R, I, S.

 Let's consider ""table"": 
   T is a new letter, A is fixed, B is new, L is new, E is fixed.

 This seems good because we test T, B, L.

 Alternatively, we could try ""cameo"" but that's 5 letters? No, ""cameo"" is 5 letters but the pattern is ?A? and then two more? Actually, we need the fifth to be E. So ""cameo"" doesn't end with E.

 Another word: ""dance"" -> D A N C E -> tests D, N, C.

 But note: we have the fifth letter as E, so it must end with E.

 Let me list some words that end with E and have A in the second position and avoid R, I, S:

   table, cable, fable, gable, sable (but S is not allowed because we know S is absent) -> avoid sable.
   dance, lance, manse (but S is absent, so avoid manse), hence dance and lance are okay? But note: we have to avoid S, so lance is okay? L-A-N-C-E.

 However, we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

 Another word: ""paste"" -> but S is absent, so we cannot use S.

 How about ""taste""? Again, S is absent.

 So avoiding R, I, S, we have:

   table, cable, fable, gable, dance, lance, pace (but pace is 4 letters? no, 4) -> 5 letter words.

 Let me check:

   table: T A B L E -> valid
   cable: C A B L E -> valid
   fable: F A B L E -> valid
   gable: G A B L E -> valid
   dance: D A N C E -> valid
   lance: L A N C E -> valid

 We can also consider:

   ""date"": too short.

   ""daze"": D A Z E -> but that's 4 letters? No, 4. We need 5: D A Z E? That's 4. So no.

   ""bake"": 4 letters.

   ""name"": N A M E -> 4 letters.

   ""plane"": P L A N E -> but the A is in the third position? We need A in the second. So no.

   ""plate"": P L A T E -> A is in the third? No.

   ""caste"": but S is absent.

   ""haste"": S is absent.

   ""latte"": L A T T E -> but T is repeated? And it ends with E. Pattern: L A T T E -> second letter A, fifth E. So that fits. But we don't know if T is in the word? And we can test T.

   ""latte"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning a type of coffee.

   But note: we are avoiding R, I, S. T is new.

 However, we have two T's? That might be less informative, but it's acceptable.

 But let's think: we want to test as many new letters as possible. So words without repeated letters are better.

 So ""table"", ""cable"", ""fable"", ""gable"", ""dance"", ""lance"" are all without repeated letters.

 We can choose one of these.

 I'll go with ""table"" because it uses T, B, L which are common.

 So the next guess: ""table""

 We expect the pattern: T A B L E

 After this, we will get feedback on T, B, L (and confirm A and E, which we already know).

 But note: we know A and E are correct and in place, so they will be marked with ✓ again.

 However, the feedback might show:
   If T is in the word and in the correct position? We don't know.
   Similarly for B and L.

 This will help us narrow down.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has letters that are more common? T is very common, B is less common. Maybe we can try ""dance"" to test D, N, C? N and C are also common.

 But since we have multiple choices, any is fine.

 Let me pick ""dance"" because it tests three new consonants: D, N, C.

 So guess: dance

 But wait, we have to consider: the first guess had A and E correct. In ""dance"", we have:
   D at position 1, A at 2 (correct), N at 3, C at 4, E at 5 (correct).

 We are testing D, N, C.

 Alternatively, we can try ""lance"" to test L, N, C? But L is also common.

 I think ""dance"" is a good choice.

 However, note that the word might have repeated letters? But we don't know.

 But to maximize information, I'll go with ""dance"".

 But let me check: we are avoiding R, I, S. ""dance"" does not contain these.

 So I choose ""dance"".

 But wait, what about the possibility of having an E at the first position? We don't know. However, in ""dance"", the first letter is D, which is new.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that has an E in the first position? But we don't have any information about that. And we are not required to test that specifically.

 Since we have two fixed letters (A and E) and we are trying to find the other three, we can focus on the first, third, and fourth positions.

 So I'll go with ""dance"".

 However, note: the word ""dance"" has the same E at the end, which we already know. So we are only testing the first, third, and fourth letters.

 But that's okay.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that has a different set of letters? 

 After consideration, I'll choose ""dance"".

 So the next guess is ""dance"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- **R, I, S** are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is **correct and in position 2** (marked ""✓"").
- **E** is **correct and in position 5** (marked ""✓"").

This means the secret word has the pattern: `_ A _ _ E`.  
For the next guess:
- Must avoid **R, I, S** entirely.
- Must retain **A** in position 2 and **E** in position 5.
- Should test new common letters (e.g., **T, N, L, C, D**) to gather more information.

A strong candidate is **""dance""**:
- Fits the pattern `_ A _ _ E` → **D** A **N** **C** E.
- Tests new letters: **D** (position 1), **N** (position 3), **C** (position 4).
- Avoids forbidden letters (R, I, S) and repeats.

We have two sets of feedback:

**Guess 1: ""raise""**
- R: not in word (x)
- A: correct and in position 2 (✓)
- I: not in word (x)
- S: not in word (x)
- E: correct and in position 5 (✓)

**Guess 2: ""dance""**
- D: in the word but wrong position (-) → so D is in the secret word, but not at position 1.
- A: correct and in position 2 (✓) → confirmed again.
- N: not in word (x)
- C: not in word (x)
- E: correct and in position 5 (✓) → confirmed again.

**Summary from guess 2**:
- D is present in the secret word, but not at position 1.
- N and C are absent (so we can avoid them in future guesses).
- Pattern remains: _ A _ _ E, with D somewhere (positions 3 or 4, since position 2 is A and 5 is E).

**Updated known information**:
- Positions:
  - 2: A (fixed)
  - 5: E (fixed)
- Present letters: D (but not at position 1; must be at position 3 or 4).
- Absent letters: R, I, S, N, C (avoid these).
- We have used letters: R, A, I, S, E, D, N, C.

**Constraints for next guess**:
- Word pattern: ? A ? ? E
- Must include D in either position 3 or 4 (since it cannot be at position 1 and is not at position 2 or 5).
- Cannot include R, I, S, N, C.
- Letters tested so far: A, E, D, R, I, S, N, C → so untested common letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

**Possible positions for D**:
- Position 3: word pattern: ? A D ? E
- Position 4: word pattern: ? A ? D E

We need to choose a guess that tests both possibilities or narrows down efficiently.

**Approach**: 
- Since D must be at position 3 or 4, we can try to find a word that places D in one of these positions to confirm. 
- Additionally, we want to test new common letters in the unknown positions (1, 3, and 4) but note that if D is at position 3, then position 4 is open; if D is at position 4, position 3 is open.
- We can prioritize words that fit one pattern and use common letters elsewhere.

**List some valid words** for each case:

**Case 1: D at position 3** → pattern: ? A D ? E
- Possible words: 
  - BADGE (B at 1, G at 4) → tests B and G
  - FADGE (less common, meaning to fadge) → avoid if possible
  - LADLE? → but LADLE has ""L"" at position 4 and 5? Pattern is L A D L E → but position 5 must be E, and we have L at position 4? So LADLE: positions 1:L, 2:A, 3:D, 4:L, 5:E → valid? But double L. However, this tests L and repeats L? But position 5 is E so it's fixed.

But note: we have position 4 as L? And then E at 5.

Other options:
  - PADRE → but R is absent (from guess 1), so invalid.
  - MADGE → M A D G E → tests M and G.

**Case 2: D at position 4** → pattern: ? A ? D E
- Possible words:
  - TABDE (not a word)
  - FABLE: F A B L E → but no D? Doesn't fit because we must include D somewhere. So not this pattern without D.
  - To include D at position 4, we need: ? A ? D E
  - HADED? Not a standard word; ""shade"" has S absent.
  - WADED: W A D E D → but pattern requires E at position 5, and WADED has D at position 5? Correct pattern: W A ? D E? Not matching because if D is at position 4, then word is ? A ? D E, so W A ? D E.

Examples:
  - CADE? Not 5 letters.
  - RADII? R absent and 5 letters? But R is absent.
  - Valid words: 
      - LADED: L A D E D? Position 5 is D, but we need E at 5. So no.
      - We need a word ending with E and D at position 4: ? A ? D E
        - GATED: G A T E D? Positions: 1:G,2:A,3:T,4:E? But E is at position 4, not D? We need D at position 4: so word must be ...D at position 4 and E at 5.

Specifically: letter3 can be any (except absent letters) and letter1 can be any, with D at position 4.

Possible words:
  - BABED? Not a word.
  - FADED: F A D E D → but D at position 3 and 5? We are looking for D at position 4? Pattern: F A D? E → no, FADED is F-A-D-E-D, so D at 3 and 5, not 4.
  - TABDE not valid.

After thinking, valid words for pattern ? A ? D E:
  - HADED? It's archaic but can be accepted as ""to haul"" or similar? Not common.
  - WADED: W-A-D-E-D? Positions: W1, A2, D3, E4, D5 → not ? A ? D E because we need D at position 4.

Let me adjust: if position 4 must be D, then:
  - Position 1: any letter
  - Position 2: A
  - Position 3: any letter (except absent ones)
  - Position 4: D
  - Position 5: E

So words like:
  - CADED: but C is absent.
  - FADED: F-A-D-E-D → has D at position 3, not 4.
  - GADGE? Not a word.
  - BADGE? B-A-D-G-E → D is at position 3, not 4.

Actually, position 4 D and position 5 E: so the last two letters are ""DE"".

Very few common words end with ""DE"" and have A in the middle.

Examples:
  - GLADE: G L A D E → but here D is at position 4? Positions: 1:G, 2:L? But we require A at position 2. So GLADE has A at position 3? Not position 2.
  - We need the second letter to be A, so word structure: [letter]A[letter]DE.

Possible words that fit [letter1]A[letter3]DE:
  - PADRE: P A D R E → but R is absent? Guess 1 said R is absent, so invalid.
  - WADED: not matching because it would be W A D E D → D at position 3 and 5? Not the pattern.

Another: 
  - HADES? H A D E S → but S is absent, and E would be at position 4? But the pattern is _ A _ _ E? We need E at position 5. So ""S"" at position 5? Not E.

Actually, the pattern is fixed position 5 as E, so we need ...E at the end.

So the only option might be words like ""BADGE"" but that has D at position 3.

After research, I think it's difficult to find a word with D at position 4 and E at 5. Therefore, D is more likely at position 3.

Given this, I'll focus on the pattern: ? A D ? E.

**Pattern  ? A D ? E**

- We must fill position 1 and position 4 with new letters (avoiding R, I, S, N, C).
- Common possibilities:
  - BADGE: B (position 1), G (position 4) → tests B and G.
  - LADGE? Not common.
  - FAGE? Not 5 letters.
  - MADGE: M (position 1), G (position 4) → tests M and G.
  - PADLE? Not a word; PADDLE has 6 letters.
  - WADGE: W (position 1), G (position 4) → meaning a bundle.

MADGE is an old term for a magpie or a name, but it's acceptable.

Other options: 
  - CADGE: but C is absent.

But we know C is absent from guess 2.

So possible words: BADGE, MADGE, WADGE, etc.

We also have the option to consider multiple possibilities.

However, note that in our previous guess ""dance"", D was marked wrong position, and we placed it at position 3 in this candidate. Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't put D at position 3 but still tests one of the positions? But we need to find where D belongs.

We might take a step back: since D must be in position 3 or 4, we can create a word that uses D in either and tests other letters.

For example, if we choose a word that has D at position 4 and also tests new letters at 1 and 3, but we found it hard to get a valid word for D at position 4.

Let me double-check: perhaps ""ANDED"" is not a word. 

Alternatively: 
  - ""OAKED""? O A K E D? No, E at position 4 and D at 5? But we need E at 5.
  - ""BAKED"": B A K E D → E at position 4? Not E at position 5.

I think it's safer to assume D is at position 3 because more common words exist that way.

So I'll proceed with pattern ? A D ? E.

Now, from BADGE, we test B and G.

But note: we also have position 1 and 4 to test. Since we don't know, we choose BADGE to test B and G.

Other options: 
  - ""LADLE"": L A D L E → but L repeated? And it tests L.
  - ""MAPLE""? No D.

But LADLE: L (position 1), D (position 3), L (position 4), E (position 5). However, we don't know if L is in the word. Also, we can test if D is correct at position 3 and also see if L appears.

But the repeated L might give less information.

So better to choose a word with distinct new letters.

I'll use ""BADGE"": 
- Patterns: B A D G E
- Tests: B at pos1, D at pos3 (this will show if D is correctly placed), G at pos4.

Why not: If D is indeed at position 3, we get:
- If B is correct? 
- And if G is correct?
We get more feedback.

Alternatively, we could use a different word to test position 1 and 4 without D? But we have to include D because it is present.

Yes, D must be in the word.

Another alternative: ""ABODE""? But A is position 2, so first letter cannot be A? Pattern: _ A ... so first letter is not A in this case.

Let me check ""ABIDE"": but I is absent? Guess 1: I absent.

Another word: ""ADORE"": but R and O? R is absent? And pattern: A D O R E? But we require A at position 2, so if we put ADORE: A at position 1? So pattern: A D O R E → position 2 would be D? Not A. So does not match.

So back to ""BADGE"".

Thus, I choose ""BADGE"" as the next guess.

But note: we have used A, D, E again? We know A and E are fixed, so using them again is fine.

So guess: badge

We'll see if D is in position 3.

If the feedback shows D at position 3 is correct (- becomes ✓) or not.

Alternatively, if D is not in position 3, then it must be in position 4? But then BADGE may not be optimal? But we don't have a good word for D at position 4.

We have to choose something.

Another possibility: omit D at position 3 and put D at position 4 in the guess? But if we do that, we need a word like ...? And since we don't know one, maybe try a word that tests D at position 4 and other letters.

For example: ""GATED"" → but G A T E D: pattern G A T E D → D at position 5? Not 4. And E is at position 4? But we need E at position 5? So E at position 4? Not.

""GRADE"": but R is absent? No.

After much consideration, I'll go with ""BADGE"".

Summary: 
- Position 1: B (new)
- Position 2: A (known)
- Position 3: D (we think it might be here, to test)
- Position 4: G (new)
- Position 5: E (known)

If D is marked correct at position 3, we're good. If not, then we know D must be at position 4 (and the word would have D at 4? and we can adjust).

So I choose ""BADGE"".

But note: we must ensure B and G are not absent? We don't know.

So in the feedback, we might get:
- B: could be present, not present, etc.
- D: if correct at position 3, ✓; else, it might be -, but since D is in the word, but we have it at position 3, if not correct there, then it should be marked ""-"" meaning it's in the word but at another position? And the only other possible position is 4.

But if we get D as ✓ in position 3, then we know. If not, it must be in position 4.

So this guess will resolve D's position.

Additionally, we test B and G.

Thus, efficient.

Hence, next guess: badge

1. **Guess 1: ""raise"" → Feedback: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)**  
   - Secret word has **A** in position 2 and **E** in position 5 → Pattern: `_ A _ _ E`.  
   - **R, I, S** are absent → Avoid these letters.  

2. **Guess 2: ""dance"" → Feedback: D(-) A(✓) N(x) C(x) E(✓)**  
   - **N** and **C** are absent → Add to avoid list.  
   - **D** is present but not in position 1 → Must be in position 3 or 4 (since position 2 and 5 are fixed).  
   - Updated pattern constraints: `_ A _ _ E` with **D** in position 3 or 4.  
   - Absent letters: **R, I, S, N, C**.  

**Known Information:**
- Fixed positions:  
  - Position 2: **A**  
  - Position 5: **E**  
- Present letter: **D** (must be in position 3 or 4).  
- Absent letters: **R, I, S, N, C** (cannot reuse).  
- Untested common letters: **B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, T, U, W, Y**, etc.  

**Strategy for Next Guess:**  
- **Resolve D's position**: Since **D** must be in position 3 or 4, prioritize a guess that tests **D** in one of these positions to confirm.  
- **Include new letters**: Test frequent consonants/vowels in open positions (1, 3, or 4) to maximize information. Positions:  
  - Position 1: Unknown and untested.  
  - Position 3: Could be **D** or a new letter (if **D** is in position 4).  
  - Position 4: Could be **D** or a new letter (if **D** is in position 3).  
- **Valid word requirements**: Must fit `_ A _ _ E`, include **D**, and exclude absent letters.  

**Word Selection:**  
- Considered options:  
  - **BADGE**: Fits `B A D G E` → Tests **B** (position 1), **D** (position 3), **G** (position 4).  
    - Pros: Tests **D** in position 3 (showing if correct or if **D** must be at position 4). Also tests common new letters **B** and **G** efficiently.  
  - Other candidates (e.g., LADLE, MADGE) excluded due to repeats (LADLE) or uncommon use (MADGE).  
- **BADGE** is optimal:  
  - If **D** gets ✓, position 3 is solved.  
  - If **D** gets -, **D** must be in position 4 (only remaining option).  
  - Tests **B** and **G** to cover new ground.  

**Decision**: Guess **BADGE**.  

<guess>badge</guess>",badge,"We have two sets of feedback:

**Guess 1: ""raise""**
- R: not in word (x)
- A: correct and in position 2 (✓)
- I: not in word (x)
- S: not in word (x)
- E: correct and in position 5 (✓)

**Summary from guess 1**: Secret word has A at position 2 and E at position 5, so pattern: _ A _ _ E. Letters R, I, S are absent.

**Guess 2: ""dance""**
- D: in the word but wrong position (-) → so D is in the secret word, but not at position 1.
- A: correct and in position 2 (✓) → confirmed again.
- N: not in word (x)
- C: not in word (x)
- E: correct and in position 5 (✓) → confirmed again.

**Summary from guess 2**:
- D is present in the secret word, but not at position 1.
- N and C are absent (so we can avoid them in future guesses).
- Pattern remains: _ A _ _ E, with D somewhere (positions 3 or 4, since position 2 is A and 5 is E).

**Updated known information**:
- Positions:
  - 2: A (fixed)
  - 5: E (fixed)
- Present letters: D (but not at position 1; must be at position 3 or 4).
- Absent letters: R, I, S, N, C (avoid these).
- We have used letters: R, A, I, S, E, D, N, C.

**Constraints for next guess**:
- Word pattern: ? A ? ? E
- Must include D in either position 3 or 4 (since it cannot be at position 1 and is not at position 2 or 5).
- Cannot include R, I, S, N, C.
- Letters tested so far: A, E, D, R, I, S, N, C → so untested common letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

**Possible positions for D**:
- Position 3: word pattern: ? A D ? E
- Position 4: word pattern: ? A ? D E

We need to choose a guess that tests both possibilities or narrows down efficiently.

**Approach**: 
- Since D must be at position 3 or 4, we can try to find a word that places D in one of these positions to confirm. 
- Additionally, we want to test new common letters in the unknown positions (1, 3, and 4) but note that if D is at position 3, then position 4 is open; if D is at position 4, position 3 is open.
- We can prioritize words that fit one pattern and use common letters elsewhere.

**List some valid words** for each case:

**Case 1: D at position 3** → pattern: ? A D ? E
- Possible words: 
  - BADGE (B at 1, G at 4) → tests B and G
  - FADGE (less common, meaning to fadge) → avoid if possible
  - LADLE? → but LADLE has ""L"" at position 4 and 5? Pattern is L A D L E → but position 5 must be E, and we have L at position 4? So LADLE: positions 1:L, 2:A, 3:D, 4:L, 5:E → valid? But double L. However, this tests L and repeats L? But position 5 is E so it's fixed.

But note: we have position 4 as L? And then E at 5.

Other options:
  - PADRE → but R is absent (from guess 1), so invalid.
  - MADGE → M A D G E → tests M and G.

**Case 2: D at position 4** → pattern: ? A ? D E
- Possible words:
  - TABDE (not a word)
  - FABLE: F A B L E → but no D? Doesn't fit because we must include D somewhere. So not this pattern without D.
  - To include D at position 4, we need: ? A ? D E
  - HADED? Not a standard word; ""shade"" has S absent.
  - WADED: W A D E D → but pattern requires E at position 5, and WADED has D at position 5? Correct pattern: W A ? D E? Not matching because if D is at position 4, then word is ? A ? D E, so W A ? D E.

Examples:
  - CADE? Not 5 letters.
  - RADII? R absent and 5 letters? But R is absent.
  - Valid words: 
      - LADED: L A D E D? Position 5 is D, but we need E at 5. So no.
      - We need a word ending with E and D at position 4: ? A ? D E
        - GATED: G A T E D? Positions: 1:G,2:A,3:T,4:E? But E is at position 4, not D? We need D at position 4: so word must be ...D at position 4 and E at 5.

Specifically: letter3 can be any (except absent letters) and letter1 can be any, with D at position 4.

Possible words:
  - BABED? Not a word.
  - FADED: F A D E D → but D at position 3 and 5? We are looking for D at position 4? Pattern: F A D? E → no, FADED is F-A-D-E-D, so D at 3 and 5, not 4.
  - TABDE not valid.

After thinking, valid words for pattern ? A ? D E:
  - HADED? It's archaic but can be accepted as ""to haul"" or similar? Not common.
  - WADED: W-A-D-E-D? Positions: W1, A2, D3, E4, D5 → not ? A ? D E because we need D at position 4.

Let me adjust: if position 4 must be D, then:
  - Position 1: any letter
  - Position 2: A
  - Position 3: any letter (except absent ones)
  - Position 4: D
  - Position 5: E

So words like:
  - CADED: but C is absent.
  - FADED: F-A-D-E-D → has D at position 3, not 4.
  - GADGE? Not a word.
  - BADGE? B-A-D-G-E → D is at position 3, not 4.

Actually, position 4 D and position 5 E: so the last two letters are ""DE"".

Very few common words end with ""DE"" and have A in the middle.

Examples:
  - GLADE: G L A D E → but here D is at position 4? Positions: 1:G, 2:L? But we require A at position 2. So GLADE has A at position 3? Not position 2.
  - We need the second letter to be A, so word structure: [letter]A[letter]DE.

Possible words that fit [letter1]A[letter3]DE:
  - PADRE: P A D R E → but R is absent? Guess 1 said R is absent, so invalid.
  - WADED: not matching because it would be W A D E D → D at position 3 and 5? Not the pattern.

Another: 
  - HADES? H A D E S → but S is absent, and E would be at position 4? But the pattern is _ A _ _ E? We need E at position 5. So ""S"" at position 5? Not E.

Actually, the pattern is fixed position 5 as E, so we need ...E at the end.

So the only option might be words like ""BADGE"" but that has D at position 3.

After research, I think it's difficult to find a word with D at position 4 and E at 5. Therefore, D is more likely at position 3.

Given this, I'll focus on the pattern: ? A D ? E.

**Pattern  ? A D ? E**

- We must fill position 1 and position 4 with new letters (avoiding R, I, S, N, C).
- Common possibilities:
  - BADGE: B (position 1), G (position 4) → tests B and G.
  - LADGE? Not common.
  - FAGE? Not 5 letters.
  - MADGE: M (position 1), G (position 4) → tests M and G.
  - PADLE? Not a word; PADDLE has 6 letters.
  - WADGE: W (position 1), G (position 4) → meaning a bundle.

MADGE is an old term for a magpie or a name, but it's acceptable.

Other options: 
  - CADGE: but C is absent.

But we know C is absent from guess 2.

So possible words: BADGE, MADGE, WADGE, etc.

We also have the option to consider multiple possibilities.

However, note that in our previous guess ""dance"", D was marked wrong position, and we placed it at position 3 in this candidate. Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't put D at position 3 but still tests one of the positions? But we need to find where D belongs.

Let me double-check: perhaps ""ANDED"" is not a word. 

Alternatively: 
  - ""OAKED""? O A K E D? No, E at position 4 and D at 5? But we need E at 5.
  - ""BAKED"": B A K E D → E at position 4? Not E at position 5.

I think it's safer to assume D is at position 3 because more common words exist that way.

So I'll proceed with pattern ? A D ? E.

Now, from BADGE, we test B and G.

But note: we also have position 1 and 4 to test. Since we don't know, we choose BADGE to test B and G.

Other options:

Another word: ""ADORE"": but R and O? R is absent? And pattern: A D O R E? But we require A at position 2, so if we put ADORE: A at position 1? So pattern: A D O R E → position 2 would be D? Not A. So does not match.

So back to ""BADGE"".

Thus, I choose ""BADGE"" as the next guess.

""GRADE"": but R is absent? No.

After much consideration, I'll go with ""BADGE"".

Summary: 
- Position 1: B (new)
