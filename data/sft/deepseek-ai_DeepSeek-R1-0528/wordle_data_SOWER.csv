We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any feedback yet. We want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get. It's often good to use a word with common letters and without repeating letters.

Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T, L, N). 

I'll choose a word that has a mix of vowels and consonants and uses 5 distinct letters.

One common starting word is ""CRANE"". It has three vowels (A, E) and two consonants (C, R), and it's often used because it covers common letters.

Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is also used, but let me stick with ""CRANE"".

So, for the first guess, I'll choose ""CRANE"".

Response format: <guess> crane </guess>

For the first guess, I'll choose a word with common letters to maximize information gathering. A strong starting word includes multiple vowels and frequent consonants. ""CRANE"" is ideal because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 consonants (C, R, N)  
- High-frequency letters in English  
- All distinct letters (no repeats)  

This gives broad coverage of common letter positions, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently based on the feedback symbols (✓, -, x).

We are given the feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
  - In ""crane"", R was in position 2 (index 1 if we start from 0), and E was in position 5 (index 4). So R is not at position 2, and E is not at position 5.
- The word does not contain C, A, or N.

We also know that R and E are present, so we have two letters to work with.

We now need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Includes R and E (since they are in the word) but in different positions than in the first guess.
- Avoids letters C, A, N since they are not in the word.
- Tries to include other common letters to test for their presence.

We have to place R and E in positions that are not the same as in ""crane"". For R, it was at position 2, so it can be at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: positions 1,3,4 for R are now possibilities. Similarly, E was at position 5, so it can be at positions 1,2,3,4.

But wait: the word is 5 letters, so positions are 1 to 5 (or indices 0 to 4). We'll use 1-based indexing for clarity.

In ""crane"":
- Position 1: C -> not in word
- Position 2: R -> in word, wrong position
- Position 3: A -> not in word
- Position 4: N -> not in word
- Position 5: E -> in word, wrong position

So for the next guess:
- We must include R, but not at position 2.
- We must include E, but not at position 5.
- We must avoid C, A, N.

Moreover, we can try to cover other vowels or common consonants. We already tested E, so perhaps we can try other vowels? The vowels we haven't tested are I, O, U. We also have consonants that are common: S, T, L, etc.

But note: we already know E is in the word, so we don't need to test it again? Actually, we do because we don't know its position. But we must not use it in position 5.

Similarly, R must not be in position 2.

Since we have limited information, we should try to use a word that contains R and E and also three new letters that are common and not yet tested (avoiding C,A,N).

What are some words that have R and E, avoiding C,A,N?

For example:
- ""TIRED"": T,I,R,E,D -> but we are placing R at position 3 (which is acceptable because it wasn't position 2) and E at position 4 (acceptable, since it wasn't position 5). Also, T, I, D are new letters.

However, let's see if we can get more common letters. Consider words with S or T.

Another idea: ""ROLES"" has R at position 1 (not 2) and E at position 5? Wait, E at position 5 is forbidden because in the first guess E was at position 5 and it was wrong position, so E cannot be at position 5? Actually, no: it could be that E is at some other position, but the feedback said it is in the word but not at position 5. We don't know that E is at position 5? Actually, the feedback means that E is in the word but the position 5 is wrong for E. Hence, E should appear in a different position in the next guess.

But ""ROLES"": 
- R at 1, O at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5? But then E is at position 4, which is allowed.

However, note we also know that A is not in the word, but O hasn't been tested yet. Similarly, L and S are new.

But ""ROLES"" might be good? Let me check the letters: R, O, L, E, S.

But we have a constraint: R must not be at position 2, which in this case it's at position 1, so okay.

However, we must be cautious: we also want to test letters that might be present. Since we know R and E are in the word, and we avoided the banned positions.

Another candidate: ""PERIL"" - P,E,R,I,L. But E is at position 2? However, we know E is in the word and we don't know the position yet. We just can't put it at position 5 because we already saw that is wrong. Putting E at position 2 is allowed? Yes, because we haven't tested position 2 for E. Similarly, R is at position 3, which is not position 2? Position 3 is new for R.

But we don't have any information about position 2 except that R is not there. So E can be at position 2? Yes.

But let me see: we have two letters we know: R and E. We need to place them in positions other than the ones we know are wrong.

Also, we must avoid C,A,N.

I think ""PRIME"" is a candidate? But wait: ""PRIME"" has P, R, I, M, E. 
- R is at position 2? Wait, position 1: P, position 2: R, position 3: I, position 4: M, position 5: E.

But we cannot put R at position 2 because the feedback said R is in the word but not at position 2. So we cannot use a word that has R at the second letter? Exactly. Therefore, ""PRIME"" is invalid because it has R at position 2.

Similarly, we cannot put E at position 5. Therefore, words that end with E must be avoided? Not necessarily. We can avoid E at position 5 and R at position 2.

How about ""STREP""? 
- S, T, R, E, P -> positions: R is at position 3 (which is not 2) and E at position 4 (not 5). So that works. 
- Also, testing S, T, P.

But ""STREP"" is a valid word? Yes, as in streptococcus, etc. But let's see: does it avoid C,A,N? Yes.

Another word: ""ADIEU"" is not good because it has A, which is not allowed. So avoiding A.

What about ""STORE""? 
- S, T, O, R, E -> R is at position 4 (not 2) and E at position 5? But putting E at position 5 is not allowed because we know E is not at position 5? Actually, we know that in the secret word, E is not at position 5. So we must not put E at position 5 in our guess? 

Wait, why? The feedback told us that in the secret word, E is not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 in our new guess and if the secret word does have E, we will get an 'x' for that position? But it's better to avoid positions we know are wrong to maximize information? Actually, we CAN put E at position 5 again, but then we know we'll get an 'x' because E cannot be at position 5? That would be inefficient because we already know E isn't at position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again? Similarly for R at position 2.

Therefore, in the next guess, we should avoid putting E in position 5 and R in position 2.

So ""STORE"" has E at position 5? So it would be inefficient? We avoid that.

Then let's consider ""STARE"": 
- But A is banned? Because feedback for A was x. So we cannot use A.

Another idea: ""QUERY"" has Q and U which are less common? Maybe not efficient.

How about ""DRIVE""? 
- D, R, I, V, E -> R at position 2 (forbidden) because in ""DRIVE"", position 2 is R? Positions: 
  1: D, 2: R -> position 2 is forbidden for R? So we cannot use words with R in the second position.

Therefore, ""DRIVE"" is invalid because R is at the second position? Exactly.

How about ""REMIT""? 
- R, E, M, I, T -> R at position 1 and E at position 2? Positions:
  1: R -> we know R is in the word, and we haven't tested position 1? Actually, in the first guess, R was at position 2 and was wrong, so position 1 is a new possibility? 
  2: E -> which we haven't tested at position 2? 

But note: we cannot put R at position 2? So as long as R is not at position 2 and E is not at position 5? In this word, R is at position 1 and E at position 2? Then E at position 2: we don't know if that might be the correct position? It could be? 

Also, the word ""REMIT"": 
- We are avoiding C,A,N. 
- Letters: R, E, M, I, T.

But E is at position 2? We have to see if that's efficient. We might test if position 1 and 2 are the correct spots? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we could choose a word where R and E are not in the same positions as in the first guess and avoid C,A,N.

Let me list some candidate words that are common and have R and E but avoid positions 2 for R and 5 for E, and avoid C,A,N.

Possible words:
- ""BRIDE"" -> but B is new? And E is at position 5? Forbidden? So not.
- ""PLIER"" -> P, L, I, E, R -> R at position 5? But we have E at position 4? So positions: 
  1: P
  2: L
  3: I
  4: E -> that's new position 4 for E
  5: R -> R at 5: which is acceptable? Because we know R is in the word and we haven't tested position 5? 

But R was at position 2 and got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not position 2. So placing R at position 5 is okay? Yes.

Similarly, E was at position 5 and got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not position 5. So in this word, E is at position 4? That's acceptable? Yes.

Therefore, ""PLIER"" is a candidate? But is ""PLIER"" a word? Yes, like a tool.

Moreover, letters: P, L, I, E, R -> avoid C,A,N? Yes.

Testing new letters: P, L, I.

Common consonants: S and T haven't been tested? Maybe we should include S or T? 

How about ""PRICE"": but has C? Not allowed? Because C is banned. So avoid.

Another word: ""SMITE"": has E at 5? Not allowed.

""STIRE"": not common? How about ""STORE"" but E at 5? Not good.

Let me think of a word with S and T? Without E at 5 or R at 2.

Example: ""STRIP"" has no E? But we have to include E? Wait, no? We have to include E? Actually, we know E is in the word? We must include E? Yes? Actually, we never have to include letters we know? But to get more information, we might choose not to? But we have 6 tries? Actually, including E and R increases the chance of getting more feedback? So it's better to include them? 

Moreover, if a letter is known to be in the word, we can test it in new positions? So it's good to include E and R again? So we should continue testing? 

Another candidate: ""TIGER"": 
- T, I, G, E, R -> E at position 4? R at position 5? 
  Position 1: T, 2: I, 3: G, 4: E (not at 5), 5: R (not at 2) -> so acceptable? 
  Also, avoids C, A, N? Yes? 
  Testing T, I, G? 

But G might be less common? But, anyway, valid word.

Another candidate: ""PRIED"": 
- P, R, I, E, D -> but R is at position 2? Forbidden? So not.

""VERGE"" has two E's? We don't know if duplicates appear? We have to be cautious? But for now, assume no duplicates? The feedback didn't show duplicates? Because in ""crane"" we had E only once? So secret word might have duplicates? But we don't know? To be safe, we can try a word without duplicates? 

But the rules don't forbid duplicates? So it's possible? But we have no information? Therefore, using distinct letters may yield more information? 

In ""PLIER"": all distinct? Yes.

In ""TIGER"": all distinct? Yes.

Which one to choose? Let me think about letter frequency.

Common letters that haven't been tested: S, T, L, O, U.

In ""PLIER"": we test L, I, P? But P is relatively common? I is a vowel? 

In ""TIGER"": T, I, G? T is very common. G is less common? 

How about ""STREW"": 
- S, T, R, E, W -> R at position 3? E at position 4? 
  Positions: 
    1: S 
    2: T 
    3: R (not 2) 
    4: E (not 5) 
    5: W 
  Avoids C,A,N? Yes. 
  Tests S, T, W? W is less common? But S and T are highly common? 

This might be better because S and T are very common? 

But does W appear in many words? Maybe? 

Another word: ""OPERA"": contains A? Not allowed? Because A is not in the word? So avoid.

""YOURS"": but has O, U? We might test O and U? However, no E? So we must include E? So it doesn't include E? We should include E? Or do we have to? 

Actually, we don't HAVE to use E and R? We can omit one? But since we know they are in the word, if we omit them, we might miss information? For example, if we guess a word without E, then we could still get feedback on other letters? But that would be inefficient? Because we already know E is in the word and should focus on its position? 

Therefore, it is better to use words that include all known letters (which are R and E) and test new positions for them, as well as new letters? 

Hence, words like ""PLIER"", ""TIGER"", and ""STREW"" are candidates? 

Also, ""FIGHT""? But no E? So avoid? 

Therefore, let's choose between: 
- PLIER: tests P, L, I (new) with E and R? 
- TIGER: tests T, I, G (new) 
- STREW: tests S, T, W (new) 
  - But S and T seem more promising? 

Also, ""STREW"" contains S and T? Which are very common? 

Another word: ""STERN"": but N is not in the word? Because N was x in the first guess? So we cannot use N? 

Similarly, ""STREP"": which we thought earlier? 
- But ""STREP"" ends with P? And E is at position 4? R at 3? 

But ""STREP"" contains S, T, E, R, P? 

Yes. 

In my list, ""STREW"" uses W? Maybe ""STREP"" is better? Because P is common? 

What about ""WREST""? 
- W, R, E, S, T -> R at position 2? Forbidden? Because R cannot be at position 2? 

Wait: ""WREST"": 
  1: W 
  2: R -> position 2 is forbidden? So invalid.

Similarly, ""ROUSE"": 
  R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5? E at 5 forbidden? 

Therefore, avoid words with R at 2 or E at 5? 

Thus, ""STREP"" seems acceptable: 
  Positions: 
  1: S 
  2: T 
  3: R (R is not at 2? Correct? It's at position 3? Which is okay) 
  4: E (not at 5? Correct? At 4? Which is okay) 
  5: P 

Also, avoids C,A,N? Yes? 

Moreover, tests S, T, P? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""STREP"" for the second guess? 

But also possible: 
- ""PIERS"": 
  1: P 
  2: I -> R not at 2? 
  3: E -> E not at 5? 
  4: R 
  5: S 
  But R is at position 4? And E at position 3? Both allowed? 

This also tests P, I, E, R, S? But E and R are already known? 

Compared to ""STREP"", ""PIERS"" has I instead of T? Which is also common? 

But T appears more? 

I think either is okay? 

Since we already know E and R, I want to put them in new positions? 

In ""crane"", R was position 2 and E position 5? 

In ""PIERS"": 
  R is at position 4 (new) 
  E is at position 3 (new) 

In ""STREP"": 
  R is at position 3 (new) 
  E is at position 4 (new) 

Both are good? 

But let me choose ""STREP"" because it has S and T? 

Alternatively, another word: ""QUERY"" is less common? Avoid Q and U? 

I think ""STREP"" is better? 

However, the word ""STREP"" is a valid English word (short for streptococcus or strep throat)? 

Yes. 

Therefore, I'll guess ""STREP"". 

But wait: is there a better word? 

Another candidate: ""GRIPE"": 
  G, R, I, P, E -> R at position 2? Forbidden? Not at position 1? But position 2 for R? No? Position 2 is R? So invalid? 

Therefore, ""GRIPE"" has R at position 2? Not allowed? 

Similarly, ""CREPT"": has C? Forbidden? 

Then, I think ""STREP"" is a good choice? 

But what about ""DIVER"": 
  D, I, V, E, R -> E at position 4? R at position 5? Both allowed? 
  Tests D, I, V? 

But V is less common? 

So ""STREP"" with S, T, P might be more informative? 

Therefore, I choose ""STREP"". 

So the next guess is ""STREP"". 

But to confirm: 
- It includes E and R? Yes. 
- R is not at position 2? It is at position 3? Yes. 
- E is not at position 5? It is at position 4? Yes. 
- Avoids C, A, N? Yes. 

Okay.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)), we know:
- The secret word contains the letters **R** and **E**, but **not** in positions 2 or 5 (based on the feedback positions in ""crane"").
- The letters **C, A, and N** are **not** in the word.
- To maximize information, the next guess should:
  - Include **R** and **E** (since they are confirmed in the word) but in **new positions** (avoid position 2 for R and position 5 for E).
  - Avoid using **C, A, N**.
  - Test new common letters (e.g., **S, T, P**) to cover more possibilities.

I chose **""strep""** as the second guess because:
- It contains **R** (position 3, not position 2) and **E** (position 4, not position 5).
- It introduces new letters: **S, T, P** (common consonants not yet tested).
- It avoids banned letters (**C, A, N**) and tests all five positions efficiently.

This guess should help determine the positions of R and E and whether S, T, or P are in the word.

<guess>strep</guess>",strep,"We are given the feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
  - In ""crane"", R was in position 2 (index 1 if we start from 0), and E was in position 5 (index 4). So R is not at position 2, and E is not at position 5.
- The word does not contain C, A, or N.

We also know that R and E are present, so we have two letters to work with.

We now need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Includes R and E (since they are in the word) but in different positions than in the first guess.
- Avoids letters C, A, N since they are not in the word.
- Tries to include other common letters to test for their presence.

We have to place R and E in positions that are not the same as in ""crane"". For R, it was at position 2, so it can be at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: positions 1,3,4 for R are now possibilities. Similarly, E was at position 5, so it can be at positions 1,2,3,4.

But wait: the word is 5 letters, so positions are 1 to 5 (or indices 0 to 4). We'll use 1-based indexing for clarity.

In ""crane"":
- Position 1: C -> not in word
- Position 2: R -> in word, wrong position
- Position 3: A -> not in word
- Position 4: N -> not in word
- Position 5: E -> in word, wrong position

So for the next guess:
- We must include R, but not at position 2.
- We must include E, but not at position 5.
- We must avoid C, A, N.

Moreover, we can try to cover other vowels or common consonants. We already tested E, so perhaps we can try other vowels? The vowels we haven't tested are I, O, U. We also have consonants that are common: S, T, L, etc.

But note: we already know E is in the word, so we don't need to test it again? Actually, we do because we don't know its position. But we must not use it in position 5.

Similarly, R must not be in position 2.

Since we have limited information, we should try to use a word that contains R and E and also three new letters that are common and not yet tested (avoiding C,A,N).

What are some words that have R and E, avoiding C,A,N?

For example:
- ""TIRED"": T,I,R,E,D -> but we are placing R at position 3 (which is acceptable because it wasn't position 2) and E at position 4 (acceptable, since it wasn't position 5). Also, T, I, D are new letters.

However, let's see if we can get more common letters. Consider words with S or T.

Another idea: ""ROLES"" has R at position 1 (not 2) and E at position 5? Wait, E at position 5 is forbidden because in the first guess E was at position 5 and it was wrong position, so E cannot be at position 5? Actually, no: it could be that E is at some other position, but the feedback said it is in the word but not at position 5. We don't know that E is at position 5? Actually, the feedback means that E is in the word but the position 5 is wrong for E. Hence, E should appear in a different position in the next guess.

But ""ROLES"": 
- R at 1, O at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5? But then E is at position 4, which is allowed.

However, note we also know that A is not in the word, but O hasn't been tested yet. Similarly, L and S are new.

But ""ROLES"" might be good? Let me check the letters: R, O, L, E, S.

But we have a constraint: R must not be at position 2, which in this case it's at position 1, so okay.

However, we must be cautious: we also want to test letters that might be present. Since we know R and E are in the word, and we avoided the banned positions.

Another candidate: ""PERIL"" - P,E,R,I,L. But E is at position 2? However, we know E is in the word and we don't know the position yet. We just can't put it at position 5 because we already saw that is wrong. Putting E at position 2 is allowed? Yes, because we haven't tested position 2 for E. Similarly, R is at position 3, which is not position 2? Position 3 is new for R.

But we don't have any information about position 2 except that R is not there. So E can be at position 2? Yes.

But let me see: we have two letters we know: R and E. We need to place them in positions other than the ones we know are wrong.

Also, we must avoid C,A,N.

I think ""PRIME"" is a candidate? But wait: ""PRIME"" has P, R, I, M, E. 
- R is at position 2? Wait, position 1: P, position 2: R, position 3: I, position 4: M, position 5: E.

But we cannot put R at position 2 because the feedback said R is in the word but not at position 2. So we cannot use a word that has R at the second letter? Exactly. Therefore, ""PRIME"" is invalid because it has R at position 2.

Similarly, we cannot put E at position 5. Therefore, words that end with E must be avoided? Not necessarily. We can avoid E at position 5 and R at position 2.

How about ""STREP""? 
- S, T, R, E, P -> positions: R is at position 3 (which is not 2) and E at position 4 (not 5). So that works. 
- Also, testing S, T, P.

But ""STREP"" is a valid word? Yes, as in streptococcus, etc. But let's see: does it avoid C,A,N? Yes.

Another word: ""ADIEU"" is not good because it has A, which is not allowed. So avoiding A.

What about ""STORE""? 
- S, T, O, R, E -> R is at position 4 (not 2) and E at position 5? But putting E at position 5 is not allowed because we know E is not at position 5? Actually, we know that in the secret word, E is not at position 5. So we must not put E at position 5 in our guess? 

Wait, why? The feedback told us that in the secret word, E is not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 in our new guess and if the secret word does have E, we will get an 'x' for that position? But it's better to avoid positions we know are wrong to maximize information? Actually, we CAN put E at position 5 again, but then we know we'll get an 'x' because E cannot be at position 5? That would be inefficient because we already know E isn't at position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again? Similarly for R at position 2.

Therefore, in the next guess, we should avoid putting E in position 5 and R in position 2.

So ""STORE"" has E at position 5? So it would be inefficient? We avoid that.

Then let's consider ""STARE"": 
- But A is banned? Because feedback for A was x. So we cannot use A.

Another idea: ""QUERY"" has Q and U which are less common? Maybe not efficient.

How about ""DRIVE""? 
- D, R, I, V, E -> R at position 2 (forbidden) because in ""DRIVE"", position 2 is R? Positions: 
  1: D, 2: R -> position 2 is forbidden for R? So we cannot use words with R in the second position.

Therefore, ""DRIVE"" is invalid because R is at the second position? Exactly.

How about ""REMIT""? 
- R, E, M, I, T -> R at position 1 and E at position 2? Positions:
  1: R -> we know R is in the word, and we haven't tested position 1? Actually, in the first guess, R was at position 2 and was wrong, so position 1 is a new possibility? 
  2: E -> which we haven't tested at position 2? 

But note: we cannot put R at position 2? So as long as R is not at position 2 and E is not at position 5? In this word, R is at position 1 and E at position 2? Then E at position 2: we don't know if that might be the correct position? It could be? 

Also, the word ""REMIT"": 
- We are avoiding C,A,N. 
- Letters: R, E, M, I, T.

But E is at position 2? We have to see if that's efficient. We might test if position 1 and 2 are the correct spots? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we could choose a word where R and E are not in the same positions as in the first guess and avoid C,A,N.

Let me list some candidate words that are common and have R and E but avoid positions 2 for R and 5 for E, and avoid C,A,N.

Possible words:
- ""BRIDE"" -> but B is new? And E is at position 5? Forbidden? So not.
- ""PLIER"" -> P, L, I, E, R -> R at position 5? But we have E at position 4? So positions: 
  1: P
  2: L
  3: I
  4: E -> that's new position 4 for E
  5: R -> R at 5: which is acceptable? Because we know R is in the word and we haven't tested position 5? 

But R was at position 2 and got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not position 2. So placing R at position 5 is okay? Yes.

Similarly, E was at position 5 and got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not position 5. So in this word, E is at position 4? That's acceptable? Yes.

Therefore, ""PLIER"" is a candidate? But is ""PLIER"" a word? Yes, like a tool.

Moreover, letters: P, L, I, E, R -> avoid C,A,N? Yes.

Testing new letters: P, L, I.

Common consonants: S and T haven't been tested? Maybe we should include S or T? 

How about ""PRICE"": but has C? Not allowed? Because C is banned. So avoid.

Another word: ""SMITE"": has E at 5? Not allowed.

""STIRE"": not common? How about ""STORE"" but E at 5? Not good.

Let me think of a word with S and T? Without E at 5 or R at 2.

Example: ""STRIP"" has no E? But we have to include E? Wait, no? We have to include E? Actually, we know E is in the word? We must include E? Yes? Actually, we never have to include letters we know? But to get more information, we might choose not to? But we have 6 tries? Actually, including E and R increases the chance of getting more feedback? So it's better to include them? 

Moreover, if a letter is known to be in the word, we can test it in new positions? So it's good to include E and R again? So we should continue testing? 

Another candidate: ""TIGER"": 
- T, I, G, E, R -> E at position 4? R at position 5? 
  Position 1: T, 2: I, 3: G, 4: E (not at 5), 5: R (not at 2) -> so acceptable? 
  Also, avoids C, A, N? Yes? 
  Testing T, I, G? 

But G might be less common? But, anyway, valid word.

Another candidate: ""PRIED"": 
- P, R, I, E, D -> but R is at position 2? Forbidden? So not.

""VERGE"" has two E's? We don't know if duplicates appear? We have to be cautious? But for now, assume no duplicates? The feedback didn't show duplicates? Because in ""crane"" we had E only once? So secret word might have duplicates? But we don't know? To be safe, we can try a word without duplicates? 

But the rules don't forbid duplicates? So it's possible? But we have no information? Therefore, using distinct letters may yield more information? 

In ""PLIER"": all distinct? Yes.

In ""TIGER"": all distinct? Yes.

Which one to choose? Let me think about letter frequency.

Common letters that haven't been tested: S, T, L, O, U.

In ""PLIER"": we test L, I, P? But P is relatively common? I is a vowel? 

In ""TIGER"": T, I, G? T is very common. G is less common? 

How about ""STREW"": 
- S, T, R, E, W -> R at position 3? E at position 4? 
  Positions: 
    1: S 
    2: T 
    3: R (not 2) 
    4: E (not 5) 
    5: W 
  Avoids C,A,N? Yes. 
  Tests S, T, W? W is less common? But S and T are highly common? 

This might be better because S and T are very common? 

But does W appear in many words? Maybe? 

Another word: ""OPERA"": contains A? Not allowed? Because A is not in the word? So avoid.

""YOURS"": but has O, U? We might test O and U? However, no E? So we must include E? So it doesn't include E? We should include E? Or do we have to? 

Actually, we don't HAVE to use E and R? We can omit one? But since we know they are in the word, if we omit them, we might miss information? For example, if we guess a word without E, then we could still get feedback on other letters? But that would be inefficient? Because we already know E is in the word and should focus on its position? 

Therefore, it is better to use words that include all known letters (which are R and E) and test new positions for them, as well as new letters? 

Hence, words like ""PLIER"", ""TIGER"", and ""STREW"" are candidates? 

Also, ""FIGHT""? But no E? So avoid? 

Therefore, let's choose between: 
- PLIER: tests P, L, I (new) with E and R? 
- TIGER: tests T, I, G (new) 
- STREW: tests S, T, W (new) 
  - But S and T seem more promising? 

Also, ""STREW"" contains S and T? Which are very common? 

Another word: ""STERN"": but N is not in the word? Because N was x in the first guess? So we cannot use N? 

Similarly, ""STREP"": which we thought earlier? 
- But ""STREP"" ends with P? And E is at position 4? R at 3? 

But ""STREP"" contains S, T, E, R, P? 

Yes. 

In my list, ""STREW"" uses W? Maybe ""STREP"" is better? Because P is common? 

What about ""WREST""? 
- W, R, E, S, T -> R at position 2? Forbidden? Because R cannot be at position 2? 

Wait: ""WREST"": 
  1: W 
  2: R -> position 2 is forbidden? So invalid.

Similarly, ""ROUSE"": 
  R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5? E at 5 forbidden? 

Therefore, avoid words with R at 2 or E at 5? 

Thus, ""STREP"" seems acceptable: 
  Positions: 
  1: S 
  2: T 
  3: R (R is not at 2? Correct? It's at position 3? Which is okay) 
  4: E (not at 5? Correct? At 4? Which is okay) 
  5: P 

Also, avoids C,A,N? Yes? 

Moreover, tests S, T, P? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""STREP"" for the second guess? 

But also possible: 
- ""PIERS"": 
  1: P 
  2: I -> R not at 2? 
  3: E -> E not at 5? 
  4: R 
  5: S 
  But R is at position 4? And E at position 3? Both allowed? 

This also tests P, I, E, R, S? But E and R are already known? 

Compared to ""STREP"", ""PIERS"" has I instead of T? Which is also common? 

But T appears more? 

I think either is okay? 

Since we already know E and R, I want to put them in new positions? 

In ""crane"", R was position 2 and E position 5? 

In ""PIERS"": 
  R is at position 4 (new) 
  E is at position 3 (new) 

In ""STREP"": 
  R is at position 3 (new) 
  E is at position 4 (new) 

Both are good? 

But let me choose ""STREP"" because it has S and T? 

Alternatively, another word: ""QUERY"" is less common? Avoid Q and U? 

I think ""STREP"" is better? 

However, the word ""STREP"" is a valid English word (short for streptococcus or strep throat)? 

Yes. 

Therefore, I'll guess ""STREP"". 

But wait: is there a better word? 

Another candidate: ""GRIPE"": 
  G, R, I, P, E -> R at position 2? Forbidden? Not at position 1? But position 2 for R? No? Position 2 is R? So invalid? 

Therefore, ""GRIPE"" has R at position 2? Not allowed? 

Similarly, ""CREPT"": has C? Forbidden? 

Then, I think ""STREP"" is a good choice? 

But what about ""DIVER"": 
  D, I, V, E, R -> E at position 4? R at position 5? Both allowed? 
  Tests D, I, V? 

But V is less common? 

So ""STREP"" with S, T, P might be more informative? 

Therefore, I choose ""STREP"". 

So the next guess is ""STREP"". 

But to confirm: 
- It includes E and R? Yes. 
- R is not at position 2? It is at position 3? Yes. 
- E is not at position 5? It is at position 4? Yes. 
- Avoids C, A, N? Yes. 

Okay.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)), we know:
- The secret word contains the letters **R** and **E**, but **not** in positions 2 or 5 (based on the feedback positions in ""crane"").
- The letters **C, A, and N** are **not** in the word.
- To maximize information, the next guess should:
  - Include **R** and **E** (since they are confirmed in the word) but in **new positions** (avoid position 2 for R and position 5 for E).
  - Avoid using **C, A, N**.
  - Test new common letters (e.g., **S, T, P**) to cover more possibilities.

I chose **""strep""** as the second guess because:
- It contains **R** (position 3, not position 2) and **E** (position 4, not position 5).
- It introduces new letters: **S, T, P** (common consonants not yet tested).
- It avoids banned letters (**C, A, N**) and tests all five positions efficiently.

This guess should help determine the positions of R and E and whether S, T, or P are in the word.",Guess 2: strep -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) R(-) E(✓) P(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,SOWER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any feedback yet. We want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get. It's often good to use a word with common letters and without repeating letters.

Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T, L, N). 

I'll choose a word that has a mix of vowels and consonants and uses 5 distinct letters.

One common starting word is ""CRANE"". It has three vowels (A, E) and two consonants (C, R), and it's often used because it covers common letters.

Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is also used, but let me stick with ""CRANE"".

So, for the first guess, I'll choose ""CRANE"".

Response format: <guess> crane </guess>For the first guess, I'll choose a word with common letters to maximize information gathering. A strong starting word includes multiple vowels and frequent consonants. ""CRANE"" is ideal because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 consonants (C, R, N)  
- High-frequency letters in English  
- All distinct letters (no repeats)  

This gives broad coverage of common letter positions, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently based on the feedback symbols (✓, -, x).

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
  - In ""crane"", R was in position 2 (index 1 if we start from 0), and E was in position 5 (index 4). So R is not at position 2, and E is not at position 5.
- The word does not contain C, A, or N.

We also know that R and E are present, so we have two letters to work with.

We now need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Includes R and E (since they are in the word) but in different positions than in the first guess.
- Avoids letters C, A, N since they are not in the word.
- Tries to include other common letters to test for their presence.

We have to place R and E in positions that are not the same as in ""crane"". For R, it was at position 2, so it can be at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: positions 1,3,4 for R are now possibilities. Similarly, E was at position 5, so it can be at positions 1,2,3,4.

But wait: the word is 5 letters, so positions are 1 to 5 (or indices 0 to 4). We'll use 1-based indexing for clarity.

In ""crane"":
- Position 1: C -> not in word
- Position 2: R -> in word, wrong position
- Position 3: A -> not in word
- Position 4: N -> not in word
- Position 5: E -> in word, wrong position

So for the next guess:
- We must include R, but not at position 2.
- We must include E, but not at position 5.
- We must avoid C, A, N.

Moreover, we can try to cover other vowels or common consonants. We already tested E, so perhaps we can try other vowels? The vowels we haven't tested are I, O, U. We also have consonants that are common: S, T, L, etc.

But note: we already know E is in the word, so we don't need to test it again? Actually, we do because we don't know its position. But we must not use it in position 5.

Similarly, R must not be in position 2.

Since we have limited information, we should try to use a word that contains R and E and also three new letters that are common and not yet tested (avoiding C,A,N).

What are some words that have R and E, avoiding C,A,N?

For example:
- ""TIRED"": T,I,R,E,D -> but we are placing R at position 3 (which is acceptable because it wasn't position 2) and E at position 4 (acceptable, since it wasn't position 5). Also, T, I, D are new letters.

However, let's see if we can get more common letters. Consider words with S or T.

Another idea: ""ROLES"" has R at position 1 (not 2) and E at position 5? Wait, E at position 5 is forbidden because in the first guess E was at position 5 and it was wrong position, so E cannot be at position 5? Actually, no: it could be that E is at some other position, but the feedback said it is in the word but not at position 5. We don't know that E is at position 5? Actually, the feedback means that E is in the word but the position 5 is wrong for E. Hence, E should appear in a different position in the next guess.

But ""ROLES"": 
- R at 1, O at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5? But then E is at position 4, which is allowed.

However, note we also know that A is not in the word, but O hasn't been tested yet. Similarly, L and S are new.

But ""ROLES"" might be good? Let me check the letters: R, O, L, E, S.

But we have a constraint: R must not be at position 2, which in this case it's at position 1, so okay.

However, we must be cautious: we also want to test letters that might be present. Since we know R and E are in the word, and we avoided the banned positions.

Another candidate: ""PERIL"" - P,E,R,I,L. But E is at position 2? However, we know E is in the word and we don't know the position yet. We just can't put it at position 5 because we already saw that is wrong. Putting E at position 2 is allowed? Yes, because we haven't tested position 2 for E. Similarly, R is at position 3, which is not position 2? Position 3 is new for R.

But we don't have any information about position 2 except that R is not there. So E can be at position 2? Yes.

But let me see: we have two letters we know: R and E. We need to place them in positions other than the ones we know are wrong.

Also, we must avoid C,A,N.

I think ""PRIME"" is a candidate? But wait: ""PRIME"" has P, R, I, M, E. 
- R is at position 2? Wait, position 1: P, position 2: R, position 3: I, position 4: M, position 5: E.

But we cannot put R at position 2 because the feedback said R is in the word but not at position 2. So we cannot use a word that has R at the second letter? Exactly. Therefore, ""PRIME"" is invalid because it has R at position 2.

Similarly, we cannot put E at position 5. Therefore, words that end with E must be avoided? Not necessarily. We can avoid E at position 5 and R at position 2.

How about ""STREP""? 
- S, T, R, E, P -> positions: R is at position 3 (which is not 2) and E at position 4 (not 5). So that works. 
- Also, testing S, T, P.

But ""STREP"" is a valid word? Yes, as in streptococcus, etc. But let's see: does it avoid C,A,N? Yes.

Another word: ""ADIEU"" is not good because it has A, which is not allowed. So avoiding A.

What about ""STORE""? 
- S, T, O, R, E -> R is at position 4 (not 2) and E at position 5? But putting E at position 5 is not allowed because we know E is not at position 5? Actually, we know that in the secret word, E is not at position 5. So we must not put E at position 5 in our guess? 

Wait, why? The feedback told us that in the secret word, E is not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 in our new guess and if the secret word does have E, we will get an 'x' for that position? But it's better to avoid positions we know are wrong to maximize information? Actually, we CAN put E at position 5 again, but then we know we'll get an 'x' because E cannot be at position 5? That would be inefficient because we already know E isn't at position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again? Similarly for R at position 2.

Therefore, in the next guess, we should avoid putting E in position 5 and R in position 2.

So ""STORE"" has E at position 5? So it would be inefficient? We avoid that.

Then let's consider ""STARE"": 
- But A is banned? Because feedback for A was x. So we cannot use A.

Another idea: ""QUERY"" has Q and U which are less common? Maybe not efficient.

How about ""DRIVE""? 
- D, R, I, V, E -> R at position 2 (forbidden) because in ""DRIVE"", position 2 is R? Positions: 
  1: D, 2: R -> position 2 is forbidden for R? So we cannot use words with R in the second position.

Therefore, ""DRIVE"" is invalid because R is at the second position? Exactly.

How about ""REMIT""? 
- R, E, M, I, T -> R at position 1 and E at position 2? Positions:
  1: R -> we know R is in the word, and we haven't tested position 1? Actually, in the first guess, R was at position 2 and was wrong, so position 1 is a new possibility? 
  2: E -> which we haven't tested at position 2? 

But note: we cannot put R at position 2? So as long as R is not at position 2 and E is not at position 5? In this word, R is at position 1 and E at position 2? Then E at position 2: we don't know if that might be the correct position? It could be? 

Also, the word ""REMIT"": 
- We are avoiding C,A,N. 
- Letters: R, E, M, I, T.

But E is at position 2? We have to see if that's efficient. We might test if position 1 and 2 are the correct spots? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we could choose a word where R and E are not in the same positions as in the first guess and avoid C,A,N.

Let me list some candidate words that are common and have R and E but avoid positions 2 for R and 5 for E, and avoid C,A,N.

Possible words:
- ""BRIDE"" -> but B is new? And E is at position 5? Forbidden? So not.
- ""PLIER"" -> P, L, I, E, R -> R at position 5? But we have E at position 4? So positions: 
  1: P
  2: L
  3: I
  4: E -> that's new position 4 for E
  5: R -> R at 5: which is acceptable? Because we know R is in the word and we haven't tested position 5? 

But R was at position 2 and got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not position 2. So placing R at position 5 is okay? Yes.

Similarly, E was at position 5 and got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not position 5. So in this word, E is at position 4? That's acceptable? Yes.

Therefore, ""PLIER"" is a candidate? But is ""PLIER"" a word? Yes, like a tool.

Moreover, letters: P, L, I, E, R -> avoid C,A,N? Yes.

Testing new letters: P, L, I.

Common consonants: S and T haven't been tested? Maybe we should include S or T? 

How about ""PRICE"": but has C? Not allowed? Because C is banned. So avoid.

Another word: ""SMITE"": has E at 5? Not allowed.

""STIRE"": not common? How about ""STORE"" but E at 5? Not good.

Let me think of a word with S and T? Without E at 5 or R at 2.

Example: ""STRIP"" has no E? But we have to include E? Wait, no? We have to include E? Actually, we know E is in the word? We must include E? Yes? Actually, we never have to include letters we know? But to get more information, we might choose not to? But we have 6 tries? Actually, including E and R increases the chance of getting more feedback? So it's better to include them? 

Moreover, if a letter is known to be in the word, we can test it in new positions? So it's good to include E and R again? So we should continue testing? 

Another candidate: ""TIGER"": 
- T, I, G, E, R -> E at position 4? R at position 5? 
  Position 1: T, 2: I, 3: G, 4: E (not at 5), 5: R (not at 2) -> so acceptable? 
  Also, avoids C, A, N? Yes? 
  Testing T, I, G? 

But G might be less common? But, anyway, valid word.

Another candidate: ""PRIED"": 
- P, R, I, E, D -> but R is at position 2? Forbidden? So not.

""VERGE"" has two E's? We don't know if duplicates appear? We have to be cautious? But for now, assume no duplicates? The feedback didn't show duplicates? Because in ""crane"" we had E only once? So secret word might have duplicates? But we don't know? To be safe, we can try a word without duplicates? 

But the rules don't forbid duplicates? So it's possible? But we have no information? Therefore, using distinct letters may yield more information? 

In ""PLIER"": all distinct? Yes.

In ""TIGER"": all distinct? Yes.

Which one to choose? Let me think about letter frequency.

Common letters that haven't been tested: S, T, L, O, U.

In ""PLIER"": we test L, I, P? But P is relatively common? I is a vowel? 

In ""TIGER"": T, I, G? T is very common. G is less common? 

How about ""STREW"": 
- S, T, R, E, W -> R at position 3? E at position 4? 
  Positions: 
    1: S 
    2: T 
    3: R (not 2) 
    4: E (not 5) 
    5: W 
  Avoids C,A,N? Yes. 
  Tests S, T, W? W is less common? But S and T are highly common? 

This might be better because S and T are very common? 

But does W appear in many words? Maybe? 

Another word: ""OPERA"": contains A? Not allowed? Because A is not in the word? So avoid.

""YOURS"": but has O, U? We might test O and U? However, no E? So we must include E? So it doesn't include E? We should include E? Or do we have to? 

Actually, we don't HAVE to use E and R? We can omit one? But since we know they are in the word, if we omit them, we might miss information? For example, if we guess a word without E, then we could still get feedback on other letters? But that would be inefficient? Because we already know E is in the word and should focus on its position? 

Therefore, it is better to use words that include all known letters (which are R and E) and test new positions for them, as well as new letters? 

Hence, words like ""PLIER"", ""TIGER"", and ""STREW"" are candidates? 

Also, ""FIGHT""? But no E? So avoid? 

Therefore, let's choose between: 
- PLIER: tests P, L, I (new) with E and R? 
- TIGER: tests T, I, G (new) 
- STREW: tests S, T, W (new) 
  - But S and T seem more promising? 

Also, ""STREW"" contains S and T? Which are very common? 

Another word: ""STERN"": but N is not in the word? Because N was x in the first guess? So we cannot use N? 

Similarly, ""STREP"": which we thought earlier? 
- But ""STREP"" ends with P? And E is at position 4? R at 3? 

But ""STREP"" contains S, T, E, R, P? 

Yes. 

In my list, ""STREW"" uses W? Maybe ""STREP"" is better? Because P is common? 

What about ""WREST""? 
- W, R, E, S, T -> R at position 2? Forbidden? Because R cannot be at position 2? 

Wait: ""WREST"": 
  1: W 
  2: R -> position 2 is forbidden? So invalid.

Similarly, ""ROUSE"": 
  R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5? E at 5 forbidden? 

Therefore, avoid words with R at 2 or E at 5? 

Thus, ""STREP"" seems acceptable: 
  Positions: 
  1: S 
  2: T 
  3: R (R is not at 2? Correct? It's at position 3? Which is okay) 
  4: E (not at 5? Correct? At 4? Which is okay) 
  5: P 

Also, avoids C,A,N? Yes? 

Moreover, tests S, T, P? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""STREP"" for the second guess? 

But also possible: 
- ""PIERS"": 
  1: P 
  2: I -> R not at 2? 
  3: E -> E not at 5? 
  4: R 
  5: S 
  But R is at position 4? And E at position 3? Both allowed? 

This also tests P, I, E, R, S? But E and R are already known? 

Compared to ""STREP"", ""PIERS"" has I instead of T? Which is also common? 

But T appears more? 

I think either is okay? 

Since we already know E and R, I want to put them in new positions? 

In ""crane"", R was position 2 and E position 5? 

In ""PIERS"": 
  R is at position 4 (new) 
  E is at position 3 (new) 

In ""STREP"": 
  R is at position 3 (new) 
  E is at position 4 (new) 

Both are good? 

But let me choose ""STREP"" because it has S and T? 

Alternatively, another word: ""QUERY"" is less common? Avoid Q and U? 

I think ""STREP"" is better? 

However, the word ""STREP"" is a valid English word (short for streptococcus or strep throat)? 

Yes. 

Therefore, I'll guess ""STREP"". 

But wait: is there a better word? 

Another candidate: ""GRIPE"": 
  G, R, I, P, E -> R at position 2? Forbidden? Not at position 1? But position 2 for R? No? Position 2 is R? So invalid? 

Therefore, ""GRIPE"" has R at position 2? Not allowed? 

Similarly, ""CREPT"": has C? Forbidden? 

Then, I think ""STREP"" is a good choice? 

But what about ""DIVER"": 
  D, I, V, E, R -> E at position 4? R at position 5? Both allowed? 
  Tests D, I, V? 

But V is less common? 

So ""STREP"" with S, T, P might be more informative? 

Therefore, I choose ""STREP"". 

So the next guess is ""STREP"". 

But to confirm: 
- It includes E and R? Yes. 
- R is not at position 2? It is at position 3? Yes. 
- E is not at position 5? It is at position 4? Yes. 
- Avoids C, A, N? Yes. 

Okay.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)), we know:
- The secret word contains the letters **R** and **E**, but **not** in positions 2 or 5 (based on the feedback positions in ""crane"").
- The letters **C, A, and N** are **not** in the word.
- To maximize information, the next guess should:
  - Include **R** and **E** (since they are confirmed in the word) but in **new positions** (avoid position 2 for R and position 5 for E).
  - Avoid using **C, A, N**.
  - Test new common letters (e.g., **S, T, P**) to cover more possibilities.

I chose **""strep""** as the second guess because:
- It contains **R** (position 3, not position 2) and **E** (position 4, not position 5).
- It introduces new letters: **S, T, P** (common consonants not yet tested).
- It avoids banned letters (**C, A, N**) and tests all five positions efficiently.

This guess should help determine the positions of R and E and whether S, T, or P are in the word.

So R is not at position 2, and E is not at position 5.\n- The word does not contain C, A, or N.\n\nWe also know that R and E are present, so we have two letters to work with.\n\nWe now need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:\n- Includes R and E (since they are in the word) but in different positions than in the first guess.\n- Avoids letters C, A, N since they are not in the word.\n- Tries to include other common letters to test for their presence.\n\nWe have to place R and E in positions that are not the same as in ""crane"". For R, it was at position 2, so it can be at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: positions 1,3,4 for R are now possibilities. Similarly, E was at position 5, so it can be at positions 1,2,3,4.\n\nBut wait: the word is 5 letters, so positions are 1 to 5 (or indices 0 to 4).

We already tested E, so perhaps we can try other vowels? The vowels we haven\'t tested are I, O, U. We also have consonants that are common: S, T, L, etc.\n\nBut note: we already know E is in the word, so we don\'t need to test it again? Actually, we do because we don\'t know its position. But we must not use it in position 5.\n\nSimilarly, R must not be in position 2.\n\nSince we have limited information, we should try to use a word that contains R and E and also three new letters that are common and not yet tested (avoiding C,A,N).\n\nWhat are some words that have R and E, avoiding C,A,N?\n\nFor example:\n- ""TIRED"": T,I,R,E,D -> but we are placing R at position 3 (which is acceptable because it wasn\'t position 2) and E at position 4 (acceptable, since it wasn\'t position 5). Also, T, I, D are new letters.\n\nHowever, let\'s see if we can get more common letters. Consider words with S or T.\n\nAnother idea: ""ROLES"" has R at position 1 (not 2) and E at position 5? Wait, E at position 5 is forbidden because in the first guess E was at position 5 and it was wrong position, so E cannot be at position 5? Actually, no: it could be that E is at some other position, but the feedback said it is in the word but not at position 5. We don\'t know that E is at position 5? Actually, the feedback means that E is in the word but the position 5 is wrong for E. Hence, E should appear in a different position in the next guess.\n\nBut ""ROLES"": \n- R at 1, O at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5? But then E is at position 4, which is allowed.\n\nHowever, note we also know that A is not in the word, but O hasn\'t been tested yet. Similarly, L and S are new.\n\nBut ""ROLES"" might be good? Let me check the letters: R, O, L, E, S.\n\nBut we have a constraint: R must not be at position 2, which in this case it\'s at position 1, so okay.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious: we also want to test letters that might be present. Since we know R and E are in the word, and we avoided the banned positions.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PERIL"" - P,E,R,I,L. But E is at position 2? However, we know E is in the word and we don\'t know the position yet. We just can\'t put it at position 5 because we already saw that is wrong. Putting E at position 2 is allowed? Yes, because we haven\'t tested position 2 for E. Similarly, R is at position 3, which is not position 2? Position 3 is new for R.\n\nBut we don\'t have any information about position 2 except that R is not there. So E can be at position 2? Yes.\n\nBut let me see: we have two letters we know: R and E. We need to place them in positions other than the ones we know are wrong.\n\nAlso, we must avoid C,A,N.\n\nI think ""PRIME"" is a candidate? But wait: ""PRIME"" has P, R, I, M, E. \n- R is at position 2? Wait, position 1: P, position 2: R, position 3: I, position 4: M, position 5: E.\n\nBut we cannot put R at position 2 because the feedback said R is in the word but not at position 2. So we cannot use a word that has R at the second letter? Exactly. Therefore, ""PRIME"" is invalid because it has R at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot put E at position 5. Therefore, words that end with E must be avoided? Not necessarily. We can avoid E at position 5 and R at position 2.\n\nHow about ""STREP""? \n- S, T, R, E, P -> positions: R is at position 3 (which is not 2) and E at position 4 (not 5). So that works. \n- Also, testing S, T, P.\n\nBut ""STREP"" is a valid word? Yes, as in streptococcus, etc. But let\'s see: does it avoid C,A,N? Yes.\n\nAnother word: ""ADIEU"" is not good because it has A, which is not allowed. So avoiding A.\n\nWhat about ""STORE""? \n- S, T, O, R, E -> R is at position 4 (not 2) and E at position 5? But putting E at position 5 is not allowed because we know E is not at position 5? Actually, we know that in the secret word, E is not at position 5. So we must not put E at position 5 in our guess? \n\nWait, why? The feedback told us that in the secret word, E is not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 in our new guess and if the secret word does have E, we will get an \'x\' for that position? But it\'s better to avoid positions we know are wrong to maximize information? Actually, we CAN put E at position 5 again, but then we know we\'ll get an \'x\' because E cannot be at position 5? That would be inefficient because we already know E isn\'t at position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again? Similarly for R at position 2.\n\nTherefore, in the next guess, we should avoid putting E in position 5 and R in position 2.\n\nSo ""STORE"" has E at position 5? So it would be inefficient? We avoid that.\n\nThen let\'s consider ""STARE"": \n- But A is banned? Because feedback for A was x. So we cannot use A.\n\nAnother idea: ""QUERY"" has Q and U which are less common? Maybe not efficient.\n\nHow about ""DRIVE""? \n- D, R, I, V, E -> R at position 2 (forbidden) because in ""DRIVE"", position 2 is R? Positions: \n  1: D, 2: R -> position 2 is forbidden for R? So we cannot use words with R in the second position.\n\nTherefore, ""DRIVE"" is invalid because R is at the second position? Exactly.\n\nHow about ""REMIT""? \n- R, E, M, I, T -> R at position 1 and E at position 2? Positions:\n  1: R -> we know R is in the word, and we haven\'t tested position 1? Actually, in the first guess, R was at position 2 and was wrong, so position 1 is a new possibility? \n  2: E -> which we haven\'t tested at position 2? \n\nBut note: we cannot put R at position 2? So as long as R is not at position 2 and E is not at position 5? In this word, R is at position 1 and E at position 2? Then E at position 2: we don\'t know if that might be the correct position? It could be? \n\nAlso, the word ""REMIT"": \n- We are avoiding C,A,N. \n- Letters: R, E, M, I, T.\n\nBut E is at position 2? We have to see if that\'s efficient. We might test if position 1 and 2 are the correct spots? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word where R and E are not in the same positions as in the first guess and avoid C,A,N.\n\nLet me list some candidate words that are common and have R and E but avoid positions 2 for R and 5 for E, and avoid C,A,N.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BRIDE"" -> but B is new? And E is at position 5? Forbidden? So not.\n- ""PLIER"" -> P, L, I, E, R -> R at position 5? But we have E at position 4? So positions: \n  1: P\n  2: L\n  3: I\n  4: E -> that\'s new position 4 for E\n  5: R -> R at 5: which is acceptable? Because we know R is in the word and we haven\'t tested position 5? \n\nBut R was at position 2 and got a \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not position 2. So placing R at position 5 is okay? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, E was at position 5 and got a \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not position 5. So in this word, E is at position 4? That\'s acceptable? Yes.\n\nTherefore, ""PLIER"" is a candidate? But is ""PLIER"" a word? Yes, like a tool.\n\nMoreover, letters: P, L, I, E, R -> avoid C,A,N? Yes.\n\nTesting new letters: P, L, I.\n\nCommon consonants: S and T haven\'t been tested? Maybe we should include S or T? \n\nHow about ""PRICE"": but has C? Not allowed? Because C is banned. So avoid.\n\nAnother word: ""SMITE"": has E at 5? Not allowed.\n\n""STIRE"": not common? How about ""STORE"" but E at 5? Not good.\n\nLet me think of a word with S and T? Without E at 5 or R at 2.\n\nExample: ""STRIP"" has no E? But we have to include E? Wait, no? We have to include E? Actually, we know E is in the word? We must include E? Yes? Actually, we never have to include letters we know? But to get more information, we might choose not to? But we have 6 tries? Actually, including E and R increases the chance of getting more feedback? So it\'s better to include them? \n\nMoreover, if a letter is known to be in the word, we can test it in new positions? So it\'s good to include E and R again? So we should continue testing? \n\nAnother candidate: ""TIGER"": \n- T, I, G, E, R -> E at position 4? R at position 5? \n  Position 1: T, 2: I, 3: G, 4: E (not at 5), 5: R (not at 2) -> so acceptable? \n  Also, avoids C, A, N? Yes? \n  Testing T, I, G? \n\nBut G might be less common? But, anyway, valid word.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PRIED"": \n- P, R, I, E, D -> but R is at position 2? Forbidden? So not.\n\n""VERGE"" has two E\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates appear?

T is very common. G is less common? \n\nHow about ""STREW"": \n- S, T, R, E, W -> R at position 3? E at position 4? \n  Positions: \n    1: S \n    2: T \n    3: R (not 2) \n    4: E (not 5) \n    5: W \n  Avoids C,A,N? Yes. \n  Tests S, T, W? W is less common?

Because A is not in the word? So avoid.\n\n""YOURS"": but has O, U? We might test O and U? However, no E? So we must include E? So it doesn\'t include E? We should include E? Or do we have to? \n\nActually, we don\'t HAVE to use E and R? We can omit one? But since we know they are in the word, if we omit them, we might miss information? For example, if we guess a word without E, then we could still get feedback on other letters? But that would be inefficient? Because we already know E is in the word and should focus on its position? \n\nTherefore, it is better to use words that include all known letters (which are R and E) and test new positions for them, as well as new letters? \n\nHence, words like ""PLIER"", ""TIGER"", and ""STREW"" are candidates? \n\nAlso, ""FIGHT""? But no E? So avoid? \n\nTherefore, let\'s choose between: \n- PLIER: tests P, L, I (new) with E and R? \n- TIGER: tests T, I, G (new) \n- STREW: tests S, T, W (new) \n  - But S and T seem more promising? \n\nAlso, ""STREW"" contains S and T? Which are very common? \n\nAnother word: ""STERN"": but N is not in the word? Because N was x in the first guess? So we cannot use N? \n\nSimilarly, ""STREP"": which we thought earlier? \n- But ""STREP"" ends with P? And E is at position 4? R at 3? \n\nBut ""STREP"" contains S, T, E, R, P? \n\nYes. \n\nIn my list, ""STREW"" uses W? Maybe ""STREP"" is better? Because P is common? \n\nWhat about ""WREST""? \n- W, R, E, S, T -> R at position 2? Forbidden? Because R cannot be at position 2? \n\nWait: ""WREST"": \n  1: W \n  2: R -> position 2 is forbidden? So invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""ROUSE"": \n  R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5? E at 5 forbidden? \n\nTherefore, avoid words with R at 2 or E at 5? \n\nThus, ""STREP"" seems acceptable: \n  Positions: \n  1: S \n  2: T \n  3: R (R is not at 2? Correct? It\'s at position 3? Which is okay) \n  4: E (not at 5? Correct? At 4? Which is okay) \n  5: P \n\nAlso, avoids C,A,N? Yes? \n\nMoreover, tests S, T, P? \n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""STREP"" for the second guess? \n\nBut also possible: \n- ""PIERS"": \n  1: P \n  2: I -> R not at 2? \n  3: E -> E not at 5? \n  4: R \n  5: S \n  But R is at position 4? And E at position 3? Both allowed? \n\nThis also tests P, I, E, R, S? But E and R are already known? \n\nCompared to ""STREP"", ""PIERS"" has I instead of T? Which is also common? \n\nBut T appears more? \n\nI think either is okay? \n\nSince we already know E and R, I want to put them in new positions? \n\nIn ""crane"", R was position 2 and E position 5? \n\nIn ""PIERS"": \n  R is at position 4 (new) \n  E is at position 3 (new) \n\nIn ""STREP"": \n  R is at position 3 (new) \n  E is at position 4 (new) \n\nBoth are good? \n\nBut let me choose ""STREP"" because it has S and T? \n\nAlternatively, another word: ""QUERY"" is less common? Avoid Q and U? \n\nI think ""STREP"" is better? \n\nHowever, the word ""STREP"" is a valid English word (short for streptococcus or strep throat)? \n\nYes. \n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""STREP"". \n\nBut wait: is there a better word? \n\nAnother candidate: ""GRIPE"": \n  G, R, I, P, E -> R at position 2? Forbidden? Not at position 1? But position 2 for R? No? Position 2 is R? So invalid? \n\nTherefore, ""GRIPE"" has R at position 2? Not allowed? \n\nSimilarly, ""CREPT"": has C? Forbidden? \n\nThen, I think ""STREP"" is a good choice? \n\nBut what about ""DIVER"": \n  D, I, V, E, R -> E at position 4? R at position 5? Both allowed? \n  Tests D, I, V? \n\nBut V is less common? \n\nSo ""STREP"" with S, T, P might be more informative? \n\nTherefore, I choose ""STREP"". \n\nSo the next guess is ""STREP"". \n\nBut to confirm: \n- It includes E and R? Yes. \n- R is not at position 2? It is at position 3? Yes. \n- E is not at position 5? It is at position 4? Yes. \n- Avoids C, A, N? Yes. \n\nOkay.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)), we know:\n- The secret word contains the letters **R** and **E**, but **not** in positions 2 or 5 (based on the feedback positions in ""crane"").\n- The letters **C, A, and N** are **not** in the word.\n- To maximize information, the next guess should:\n  - Include **R** and **E** (since they are confirmed in the word) but in **new positions** (avoid position 2 for R and position 5 for E).\n  - Avoid using **C, A, N**.\n  - Test new common letters (e.g., **S, T, P**) to cover more possibilities.\n\nI chose **""strep""** as the second guess because:\n- It contains **R** (position 3, not position 2) and **E** (position 4, not position 5).\n- It introduces new letters: **S, T, P** (common consonants not yet tested).\n- It avoids banned letters (**C, A, N**) and tests all five positions efficiently.\n\nThis guess should help determine the positions of R and E and whether S, T, or P are in the word.\n\n<guess>strep</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: strep -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) R(-) E(✓) P(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   This tells us:
     - R is in the word but not in position 2 (index 1).
     - E is in the word but not in position 5 (index 4).
     - C, A, N are not in the word.

2. ""strep"" -> S(✓) T(x) R(-) E(✓) P(x)
   This tells us:
     - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1, index 0).
     - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, index 3). So E is fixed at position 4.
     - R is in the word but not in position 3 (index 2). Also, since we know from the first guess that R is not at position 2, and now position 3 is also wrong? So position 3 is now excluded for R? But note: in ""strep"", position 3 is R and we got a '-', meaning it is in the word but not at that position? So R cannot be at position 1? Wait, we don't know? 

Wait, let's break down:

- S at position 1: ✓ -> so the word starts with S.
- T at position 2: x -> T is not in the word? Because x means not in the word? Yes? 
- R at position 3: - -> R is in the word but not at position 3? 
- E at position 4: ✓ -> so E is at position 4? Which matches the feedback? 
- P at position 5: x -> P is not in the word? 

Important corrections:
- T is not in the word at all? So we can eliminate T? 
- P is not in the word? 

Also, we now know the word has:
- S at the start (position 1) -> fixed? 
- E at position 4 -> fixed? 
- R is in the word but cannot be at position 3? And we already know from ""crane"" that R cannot be at position 2? So R cannot be at positions 2 or 3? 

What are the possible positions for R? Positions: 1, 4, 5? But wait: 
- Position 1: We have S at position 1? So position 1 is taken? Therefore, R cannot be at position 1? 
- Position 4 is E? So that's taken? 
- Then R must be at position 5? Because positions 2 and 3 are excluded? 

Therefore, R must be at position 5? 

Also, we know E is at position 4? 

So the word so far: 
Position 1: S 
Position 2: ? (not T, and not R? And not C,A,N) 
Position 3: ? (not R? And not T,P, and not C,A,N) 
Position 4: E 
Position 5: R ? Because R must be somewhere? And only position 5 is left? 

But wait: we have two known letters: E and R? And positions? 
We have:
- E at position 4? Confirmed? 
- S at position 1? Confirmed? 

And R must be in one of the remaining positions? But we know R cannot be at position 2? Or 3? Because: 
From ""crane"": R was at position 2? And we got '-', so R is not at position 2? 
From ""strep"": R was at position 3? And we got '-', so R is not at position 3? 

And position 1 is S? Position 4 is E? Then position 5 must be R? 

Therefore, position 5 is R? 

So we can fix position 5 as R? 

Then, what about the middle? We have:
Position 2: a letter that must be in the word? Not T, not C,A,N,P? 
Position 3: a letter that must be in the word? Not T, P, and not C,A,N? 

But note: in ""crane"", we had E at position 5? But now we know E is at position 4? And position 5 is R? 

Also, we know the word begins with S, ends with R? And has E at position 4? 

So the word is: S _ _ E R 

We need to find the two middle letters? 

Constraints:
- Cannot contain T (from ""strep"": T at position 2? Got x? So T is not in the word? So eliminate T? Also, P is not in the word? 
- Cannot contain C, A, N (from first guess)? 
- So banned letters: T, C, A, N, P? 

And we need to include any other letters? 

Also, from ""crane"": we had E at position 5? But now we know E is at position 4? So the word does contain E? And R? And S? 

But what about the letters tested? In ""strep"": S, T, R, E, P? So T and P are not in the word? 

And ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E -> C, A, N not in word? 

So overall banned: C, A, N, T, P? 

So the remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

We need two of these? 

But note: we have two positions? 

Possible words: 

Let me think: common words that fit? 

Pattern: S _ _ E R 

And the missing letters must be from the allowed set? 

At this point, we could list common 5-letter words in the form S _ _ E R? 

For example:
- ""SOWER"": S, O, W, E, R -> O and W? 
- ""SUPER"": has U? But P is banned? So not? 
- ""SABER"": A is banned? 
- ""SAFER"": A banned? 
- ""SIZER"": S, I, Z, E, R? 
- ""SHEER"": H, E? But duplicates? 
- ""SKEIN"": has N? banned? 
- ""SLEER"": uncommon? 
- ""SMEAR"": M, E? But A banned? 
- ""SOBER"": O, B? 
- ""SOLER"": O, L? 
- ""SONER"": has N? 
- ""SOWER"": O, W? 

But we must avoid any letter that is banned? 

Therefore, potential letters? Let me see:

Common words: 
- ""SIXER"": S, I, X, E, R -> X is uncommon? 
- ""SIZER"": S, I, Z, E, R -> Z is less common? 

Another: ""SHRED"": 
- S, H, R, E, D? But wait: position? ""SHRED"": 
  Position 1: S? 
  Position 2: H 
  Position 3: R -> not allowed? Because we know R cannot be at position 3? And also, in ""SHRED"", R is at position 3? Which we know cannot be? Because from ""strep"" we have R at position 3 and got '-', so it's wrong? 

Oh, wait: we are now filling as S _ _ E R? So positions:
1: S
2: ? 
3: ? 
4: E
5: R

In ""SHRED"": 
  Position 3 is R? But we need position 3 to be some other letter? And position 5 is D? But we now fix position 5 as R? So ""SHRED"" would be S,H,R,E,D? So ends with D? But we need ends with R? So not? 

Therefore, the word must end with R? 

Hence, ""SABER"": invalid? 

Then let me list words that end with ""ER"" and start with ""S"", and have 5 letters? 

Common ones: 
- ""SABER"": invalid? Because A is banned? 
- ""SAPER"": P banned? 
- ""SATER"": T banned? 
- ""SAXER"": A banned? 
- ""SEWER"": E at position 2? But we have E at position 4? And word ""SEWER"": S,E,W,E,R -> duplicate E? 
    Pattern: S,E at position 2, W, E at position 4? That would require E at two places? 

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? 

But the feedback from the first guess? We had only one E? So not impossible? 

But let's see: ""SEWER"": 
  Position 1: S 
  Position 2: E? But that would be a duplicate? 
  Position 3: W 
  Position 4: E 
  Position 5: R 

And we know E is at position 4? So position 2? Could be E? But how do we know? 

We don't have information that E cannot be duplicated? But we have to consider? 

Moreover, in ""SEWER"", E is at position 2? We haven't tested position 2 yet? 

But note: we banned T? So ""SEWER"" with letters: S, E, W, E, R? 

Positions:
1: S (matches? Yes)
2: E? We don't know? 
3: W? 
4: E (matches? Yes)
5: R? We now inferred that? 

But we haven't tested position 3? 

But we also have constraints: the missing letters must not be banned? 

Banned letters: C,A,N,T,P? 

So W is not banned? 

Also, E is not banned? So duplicates? 

Therefore, ""SEWER"" is a potential? 

But let me see: another common word: ""SHIER""? But that ends with R? But pattern: S,H,I,E,R? So S at 1, H at 2, I at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 

That fits? 

Similarly: ""SIZER"": S,I,Z,E,R? 

Now, which one to choose? 

But we also need to use the feedback? 

The only letters we haven't tested? We need to test position 2 and 3? 

Since we are about to guess? We might guess ""SIXER""? But that might be uncommon? 

Alternatively, we have information? 

In the previous guesses, we didn't test H? Or I? 

But we have to avoid banned letters? 

Therefore, I think ""SHIER"" might be good? But wait: ""SHIER"" is a word? Meaning shy? 

Also, ""SKIER"": S,K,I,E,R? K is common? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we can use a word that tests more new letters? 

But we have only two positions? So the word must be of the form S X Y E R? Where X and Y are letters? And X,Y must not be C,A,N,T,P? And they must form a word? 

Possible? 
Common letters: O, W? For ""SOWER""? 
Or U? For ""SUPER""? But P banned? 
Or L? For ""SLIER""? 

Let me list common words? 
- ""SKIER"" - S,K,I,E,R? K and I? 
- ""SHOER"" - S,H,O,E,R? 
- ""SIZER"" - S,I,Z,E,R? 
- ""SOWER"" - S,O,W,E,R? 
- ""SLIER"" - S,L,I,E,R? 
- ""SUBER"" - S,U,B,E,R? B? 
- ""SUTER"" - T? banned? 

Therefore, we have several candidates: SHOER, SIZER, SKIER, SOWER, SLIER, etc? 

Now, how to choose? 

We also have the feedback from ""crane"": the word has E? Which we know? Then? 

We need to test letters? We don't have any -? 

Perhaps the best is to use a word that includes letters commonly found? Like vowels? We haven't tested many vowels? 

In the first guess? We tested A, E? So we know E is in? A is not? 

The vowels: E is present? A is absent? O, I, U are untested? 

Therefore, we might choose a word that has O and I? Or U? 

But in ""SOWER"", we have O? But no I? 

In ""SHOER"", O? 

In ""SKIER"", I? 

In ""SUBER"", U? 

We might also test common consonants? 

Since we are at guess 3, we can try to cover more letters? 

But note: we have two positions? So each guess tests two letters? 

If we get a ✓, we fix? Otherwise, we get - or x? 

Then we can proceed? 

Since we want to solve in few guesses? 

Or we can try ""SKIER"" to test K and I? 

But let me see: how about ""SHIRE""? 
Wait: ""SHIRE"": 
  S,H,I,R,E -> positions: 
    1: S? 
    2: H 
    3: I 
    4: R? -> but we know E must be at position 4? In ""SHIRE"", position 4 is R? Not E? So not? 

Similarly, ""SOLER"": S,O,L,E,R -> fits? 
But L? 

""SOLER"" is a word? 

Another one: ""BOXER"": starts with B? 

I think ""SIZER"" might be not common? 

Perhaps one of the most common is ""SKIER""? Or ""SHOER""? 

But ""SHOER"" has O? 

Since we have position 5 fixed as R? And 4 as E? And 1 as S? Then the word must be S X Y E R? 

We can choose a word that maximizes new letters? Like using two letters that are common? Maybe O and W? ""SOWER""? 

But O and W? 

Another idea: from the first guess? We had E? And R? So in ""crane"", E at position 5 was wrong? But now fixed? 

We also did not test? 

Perhaps ""SLEEK""? But ends with K? 

No? Must end with R? 

Therefore, I think ""SOWER"" is a word? Meaning someone who sows? 

But let's see: I'll choose ""SHIER"": 
- S, H, I, E, R? 
  Positions:
    1: S (fixed)
    2: H 
    3: I 
    4: E (fixed)
    5: R (fixed)

Letters: H and I are allowed? 

Similarly, ""SKIER"": S,K,I,E,R? 

Perhaps we should choose one? 

But I need to pick: let me pick ""SHIER""? 

But wait: we have to be cautious? 

Alternatively, we know more? 

Actually, we don't have information about position 3? We want to test letters? 

Perhaps we can use a word that includes a letter we think is likely? 

But without more information? 

Another thought: in ""crane"", we had E at position 5 got '-', meaning E is in the word? But we know E is fixed at position 4? Then? 

Similarly, the word only has one E? Not necessarily? 

But let's assume: there is at least one E? 

To save moves? Perhaps we should try a word that tests fewer new letters? But we have to? 

I think ""SHIER"" is fine? 

But let me try to reason: 

Known: 
- Word starts with S? 
- Ends with R? 
- Has E at position 4? 
- Banned letters: C,A,N,T,P? 
- We need to fill positions 2 and 3? 

Common vowels? Position 2: often vowels? But we know A is banned? Then E? But E is at position 4? So position 2 could be I, O, U? 

Similarly, position 3? consonants? 

Therefore, ""SHIER"" has H and I? 

But ""SOWER"" is also? 

Perhaps ""SOWER"" is better? Because it tests O and W? 

But O is common? 

Another word: ""SOLVE""? But ends with E? 

Not? 

I think I'll go with ""SHIER""? 

So guessed word: ""SHIER""? 

But wait: the feedback might help? 

We have to give one? 

Or perhaps we can choose one that covers more possibilities? 

Since we have confirmed S and E? And we think R must be at 5? Then guess 3 should be a guess that helps eliminate many possibilities? 

But we have limited options? 

Let me list possible words? 

Common words: 
- SHEER? has two E? and E at position 4? Possible? 
- SHEER: S,H,E,E,R -> 
  1:S, 2:H, 3:E? But E should be at 4? So position 3 is E? Which might be incorrect? Because E is at 4? But position 3 could be another E? 
  So ""SHEER"": 
      Pos1: S? 
      Pos2: H 
      Pos3: E? -> wrong position? Because E is at position 4? 
      But we have E at position 4? Then position 3 also E? 
  If the word has two E's? Then E at position 3 is another E? 
  And then position 4: E? -> ✓? 
  Position 5: R? 
  So possible? 

But banned letters: excluded? H is not banned? 

But forbidden by the pattern? Not really? 

Similarly, ""SHEER"" has E at position 3? And E at 4? We know E is at 4? If E is duplicated? Then E at position 3? 

But then it would be in the word? 

But we don't know? 

Therefore, we must consider? 

Or perhaps not? 

I think to be safe? We should guess a word that makes sense? 

But ""SHIER"" is acceptable? 

So I'll guess ""SHIER""? 

Therefore: <guess>shier</guess> 

But let's formalize: 

Based on feedback:

1. S is confirmed at position 1? 
2. E is confirmed at position 4? 
3. R must be at position 5 (since all other positions are taken or forbidden)? 
   Positions: 
      1: S? 
      2: cannot be R? 
      3: cannot be R? 
      4: E? 
      5: remaining position? 
4. Banned letters: C, A, N, T, P?
5. The unknown letters: position 2 and 3? Must be found and not banned? 

I use ""shier"" to test:
- Position 2: H (common letter? Allow to test H? 
- Position 3: I (common vowel) 

This will provide feedback on whether H and I are in the word and their positions? Since positions 2 and 3 are not fixed? 

If we get a ✓ at position 2? Then we know H is correct? Etc? 

So guessed word: ""shier"" 

Alternatively: we might have already deduced that R must be at 5? But we need to verify? 

In our case, it's deduced? 

Therefore?
</think>
### Previous Feedback Analysis:
- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
  - Letters **C, A, N** are **not in the word**.  
  - **R is in the word** but not at position 2.  
  - **E is in the word** but not at position 5.  
- **Guess 2: strep** → Feedback: S(✓) T(x) R(-) E(✓) P(x)  
  - **S is at position 1** (correct and fixed).  
  - **T is not in the word**.  
  - **R is in the word** but not at position 3.  
  - **E is at position 4** (correct and fixed).  
  - **P is not in the word**.  
- **Complete deductions**:  
  - Fixed positions: **S** (pos1), **E** (pos4).  
  - **R must be at position 5** (only available position, as it cannot be at pos2 or pos3).  
  - Word structure: **S _ _ E R**.  
  - Banned letters: **C**, **A**, **N**, **T**, **P** (absent from word).  
  - Unknown positions: 2 and 3 require two new letters not banned.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Focus on **positions 2 and 3**, where new letters must be from the allowed set (e.g., B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z).  
- Maximize information by testing **common unprobed vowels/consonants** (e.g., **O**, **I**, **U**, **H**, **L**).  
- Prioritize words with **""H"" and ""I""** to cover a common vowel (I) and consonant (H).  
- **""SHIER""** fits:  
  - Conforms to the structure **S _ _ E R**.  
  - Tests ""H"" at pos2 and ""I"" at pos3.  
  - Banned letters avoided (no C,A,N,T,P).  
  - Efficiently probes letters missing from prior feedback.  

<guess>shier</guess>",shier,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   This tells us:
     - R is in the word but not in position 2 (index 1).
     - E is in the word but not in position 5 (index 4).
     - C, A, N are not in the word.

2. ""strep"" -> S(✓) T(x) R(-) E(✓) P(x)
   This tells us:
     - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1, index 0).
     - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, index 3). So E is fixed at position 4.
     - R is in the word but not in position 3 (index 2). Also, since we know from the first guess that R is not at position 2, and now position 3 is also wrong? So position 3 is now excluded for R? But note: in ""strep"", position 3 is R and we got a '-', meaning it is in the word but not at that position? So R cannot be at position 1? Wait, we don't know? 

Wait, let's break down:

- S at position 1: ✓ -> so the word starts with S.
- T at position 2: x -> T is not in the word? Because x means not in the word? Yes? 
- R at position 3: - -> R is in the word but not at position 3? 
- E at position 4: ✓ -> so E is at position 4? Which matches the feedback? 
- P at position 5: x -> P is not in the word? 

Important corrections:
- T is not in the word at all? So we can eliminate T? 
- P is not in the word? 

Also, we now know the word has:
- S at the start (position 1) -> fixed? 
- E at position 4 -> fixed? 
- R is in the word but cannot be at position 3? And we already know from ""crane"" that R cannot be at position 2? So R cannot be at positions 2 or 3? 

What are the possible positions for R? Positions: 1, 4, 5? But wait: 
- Position 1: We have S at position 1? So position 1 is taken? Therefore, R cannot be at position 1? 
- Position 4 is E? So that's taken? 
- Then R must be at position 5? Because positions 2 and 3 are excluded? 

Therefore, R must be at position 5? 

Also, we know E is at position 4? 

So the word so far: 
Position 1: S 
Position 2: ? (not T, and not R? And not C,A,N) 
Position 3: ? (not R? And not T,P, and not C,A,N) 
Position 4: E 
Position 5: R ? Because R must be somewhere? And only position 5 is left? 

But wait: we have two known letters: E and R? And positions? 
We have:
- E at position 4? Confirmed? 
- S at position 1? Confirmed? 

And R must be in one of the remaining positions? But we know R cannot be at position 2? Or 3? Because: 
From ""crane"": R was at position 2? And we got '-', so R is not at position 2? 
From ""strep"": R was at position 3? And we got '-', so R is not at position 3? 

And position 1 is S? Position 4 is E? Then position 5 must be R? 

Therefore, position 5 is R? 

So we can fix position 5 as R? 

Then, what about the middle? We have:
Position 2: a letter that must be in the word? Not T, not C,A,N,P? 
Position 3: a letter that must be in the word? Not T, P, and not C,A,N? 

But note: in ""crane"", we had E at position 5? But now we know E is at position 4? And position 5 is R? 

Also, we know the word begins with S, ends with R? And has E at position 4? 

So the word is: S _ _ E R 

We need to find the two middle letters? 

Constraints:
- Cannot contain T (from ""strep"": T at position 2? Got x? So T is not in the word? So eliminate T? Also, P is not in the word? 
- Cannot contain C, A, N (from first guess)? 
- So banned letters: T, C, A, N, P? 

And we need to include any other letters? 

Also, from ""crane"": we had E at position 5? But now we know E is at position 4? So the word does contain E? And R? And S? 

But what about the letters tested? In ""strep"": S, T, R, E, P? So T and P are not in the word? 

And ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E -> C, A, N not in word? 

So overall banned: C, A, N, T, P? 

So the remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

We need two of these? 

But note: we have two positions? 

Possible words: 

Let me think: common words that fit? 

Pattern: S _ _ E R 

And the missing letters must be from the allowed set? 

At this point, we could list common 5-letter words in the form S _ _ E R? 

For example:
- ""SOWER"": S, O, W, E, R -> O and W? 
- ""SUPER"": has U? But P is banned? So not? 
- ""SABER"": A is banned? 
- ""SAFER"": A banned? 
- ""SIZER"": S, I, Z, E, R? 
- ""SHEER"": H, E? But duplicates? 
- ""SKEIN"": has N? banned? 
- ""SLEER"": uncommon? 
- ""SMEAR"": M, E? But A banned? 
- ""SOBER"": O, B? 
- ""SOLER"": O, L? 
- ""SONER"": has N? 
- ""SOWER"": O, W? 

But we must avoid any letter that is banned? 

Therefore, potential letters? Let me see:

Common words: 
- ""SIXER"": S, I, X, E, R -> X is uncommon? 
- ""SIZER"": S, I, Z, E, R -> Z is less common? 

Another: ""SHRED"": 
- S, H, R, E, D? But wait: position? ""SHRED"": 
  Position 1: S? 
  Position 2: H 
  Position 3: R -> not allowed? Because we know R cannot be at position 3? And also, in ""SHRED"", R is at position 3? Which we know cannot be? Because from ""strep"" we have R at position 3 and got '-', so it's wrong? 

Oh, wait: we are now filling as S _ _ E R? So positions:
1: S
2: ? 
3: ? 
4: E
5: R

In ""SHRED"": 
  Position 3 is R? But we need position 3 to be some other letter? And position 5 is D? But we now fix position 5 as R? So ""SHRED"" would be S,H,R,E,D? So ends with D? But we need ends with R? So not? 

Therefore, the word must end with R? 

Hence, ""SABER"": invalid? 

Then let me list words that end with ""ER"" and start with ""S"", and have 5 letters? 

Common ones: 
- ""SABER"": invalid? Because A is banned? 
- ""SAPER"": P banned? 
- ""SATER"": T banned? 
- ""SAXER"": A banned? 
- ""SEWER"": E at position 2? But we have E at position 4? And word ""SEWER"": S,E,W,E,R -> duplicate E? 
    Pattern: S,E at position 2, W, E at position 4? That would require E at two places? 

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? 

But the feedback from the first guess? We had only one E? So not impossible? 

But let's see: ""SEWER"": 
  Position 1: S 
  Position 2: E? But that would be a duplicate? 
  Position 3: W 
  Position 4: E 
  Position 5: R 

And we know E is at position 4? So position 2? Could be E? But how do we know? 

We don't have information that E cannot be duplicated? But we have to consider? 

Moreover, in ""SEWER"", E is at position 2? We haven't tested position 2 yet? 

But note: we banned T? So ""SEWER"" with letters: S, E, W, E, R? 

Positions:
1: S (matches? Yes)
2: E? We don't know? 
3: W? 
4: E (matches? Yes)
5: R? We now inferred that? 

But we haven't tested position 3? 

But we also have constraints: the missing letters must not be banned? 

Banned letters: C,A,N,T,P? 

So W is not banned? 

Also, E is not banned? So duplicates? 

Therefore, ""SEWER"" is a potential? 

But let me see: another common word: ""SHIER""? But that ends with R? But pattern: S,H,I,E,R? So S at 1, H at 2, I at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 

That fits? 

Similarly: ""SIZER"": S,I,Z,E,R? 

Now, which one to choose? 

But we also need to use the feedback? 

The only letters we haven't tested? We need to test position 2 and 3? 

Since we are about to guess? We might guess ""SIXER""? But that might be uncommon? 

Alternatively, we have information? 

In the previous guesses, we didn't test H? Or I? 

But we have to avoid banned letters? 

Therefore, I think ""SHIER"" might be good? But wait: ""SHIER"" is a word? Meaning shy? 

Also, ""SKIER"": S,K,I,E,R? K is common? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we can use a word that tests more new letters? 

But we have only two positions? So the word must be of the form S X Y E R? Where X and Y are letters? And X,Y must not be C,A,N,T,P? And they must form a word? 

Possible? 
Common letters: O, W? For ""SOWER""? 
Or U? For ""SUPER""? But P banned? 
Or L? For ""SLIER""? 

Let me list common words? 
- ""SKIER"" - S,K,I,E,R? K and I? 
- ""SHOER"" - S,H,O,E,R? 
- ""SIZER"" - S,I,Z,E,R? 
- ""SOWER"" - S,O,W,E,R? 
- ""SLIER"" - S,L,I,E,R? 
- ""SUBER"" - S,U,B,E,R? B? 
- ""SUTER"" - T? banned? 

Therefore, we have several candidates: SHOER, SIZER, SKIER, SOWER, SLIER, etc? 

Now, how to choose? 

We also have the feedback from ""crane"": the word has E? Which we know? Then? 

We need to test letters? We don't have any -? 

Perhaps the best is to use a word that includes letters commonly found? Like vowels? We haven't tested many vowels? 

In the first guess? We tested A, E? So we know E is in? A is not? 

The vowels: E is present? A is absent? O, I, U are untested? 

Therefore, we might choose a word that has O and I? Or U? 

But in ""SOWER"", we have O? But no I? 

In ""SHOER"", O? 

In ""SKIER"", I? 

In ""SUBER"", U? 

We might also test common consonants? 

Since we are at guess 3, we can try to cover more letters? 

But note: we have two positions? So each guess tests two letters? 

If we get a ✓, we fix? Otherwise, we get - or x? 

Then we can proceed? 

Since we want to solve in few guesses? 

Or we can try ""SKIER"" to test K and I? 

But let me see: how about ""SHIRE""? 
Wait: ""SHIRE"": 
  S,H,I,R,E -> positions: 
    1: S? 
    2: H 
    3: I 
    4: R? -> but we know E must be at position 4? In ""SHIRE"", position 4 is R? Not E? So not? 

Similarly, ""SOLER"": S,O,L,E,R -> fits? 
But L? 

""SOLER"" is a word? 

Another one: ""BOXER"": starts with B? 

I think ""SIZER"" might be not common? 

Perhaps one of the most common is ""SKIER""? Or ""SHOER""? 

But ""SHOER"" has O? 

Since we have position 5 fixed as R? And 4 as E? And 1 as S? Then the word must be S X Y E R? 

We can choose a word that maximizes new letters? Like using two letters that are common? Maybe O and W? ""SOWER""? 

But O and W? 

Another idea: from the first guess? We had E? And R? So in ""crane"", E at position 5 was wrong? But now fixed? 

We also did not test? 

Perhaps ""SLEEK""? But ends with K? 

No? Must end with R? 

Therefore, I think ""SOWER"" is a word? Meaning someone who sows? 

But let's see: I'll choose ""SHIER"": 
- S, H, I, E, R? 
  Positions:
    1: S (fixed)
    2: H 
    3: I 
    4: E (fixed)
    5: R (fixed)

Letters: H and I are allowed? 

Similarly, ""SKIER"": S,K,I,E,R? 

Perhaps we should choose one? 

But I need to pick: let me pick ""SHIER""? 

But wait: we have to be cautious? 

Alternatively, we know more? 

Actually, we don't have information about position 3? We want to test letters? 

Perhaps we can use a word that includes a letter we think is likely? 

But without more information? 

Another thought: in ""crane"", we had E at position 5 got '-', meaning E is in the word? But we know E is fixed at position 4? Then? 

Similarly, the word only has one E? Not necessarily? 

But let's assume: there is at least one E? 

To save moves? Perhaps we should try a word that tests fewer new letters? But we have to? 

I think ""SHIER"" is fine? 

But let me try to reason: 

Known: 
- Word starts with S? 
- Ends with R? 
- Has E at position 4? 
- Banned letters: C,A,N,T,P? 
- We need to fill positions 2 and 3? 

Common vowels? Position 2: often vowels? But we know A is banned? Then E? But E is at position 4? So position 2 could be I, O, U? 

Similarly, position 3? consonants? 

Therefore, ""SHIER"" has H and I? 

But ""SOWER"" is also? 

Perhaps ""SOWER"" is better? Because it tests O and W? 

But O is common? 

Another word: ""SOLVE""? But ends with E? 

Not? 

I think I'll go with ""SHIER""? 

So guessed word: ""SHIER""? 

But wait: the feedback might help? 

We have to give one? 

Or perhaps we can choose one that covers more possibilities? 

Since we have confirmed S and E? And we think R must be at 5? Then guess 3 should be a guess that helps eliminate many possibilities? 

But we have limited options? 

Let me list possible words? 

Common words: 
- SHEER? has two E? and E at position 4? Possible? 
- SHEER: S,H,E,E,R -> 
  1:S, 2:H, 3:E? But E should be at 4? So position 3 is E? Which might be incorrect? Because E is at 4? But position 3 could be another E? 
  So ""SHEER"": 
      Pos1: S? 
      Pos2: H 
      Pos3: E? -> wrong position? Because E is at position 4? 
      But we have E at position 4? Then position 3 also E? 
  If the word has two E's? Then E at position 3 is another E? 
  And then position 4: E? -> ✓? 
  Position 5: R? 
  So possible? 

But banned letters: excluded? H is not banned? 

But forbidden by the pattern? Not really? 

Similarly, ""SHEER"" has E at position 3? And E at 4? We know E is at 4? If E is duplicated? Then E at position 3? 

But then it would be in the word? 

But we don't know? 

Therefore, we must consider? 

Or perhaps not? 

I think to be safe? We should guess a word that makes sense? 

But ""SHIER"" is acceptable? 

So I'll guess ""SHIER""? 

Therefore: <guess>shier</guess> 

But let's formalize: 

Based on feedback:

1. S is confirmed at position 1? 
2. E is confirmed at position 4? 
3. R must be at position 5 (since all other positions are taken or forbidden)? 
   Positions: 
      1: S? 
      2: cannot be R? 
      3: cannot be R? 
      4: E? 
      5: remaining position? 
4. Banned letters: C, A, N, T, P?
5. The unknown letters: position 2 and 3? Must be found and not banned? 

I use ""shier"" to test:
- Position 2: H (common letter? Allow to test H? 
- Position 3: I (common vowel) 

This will provide feedback on whether H and I are in the word and their positions? Since positions 2 and 3 are not fixed? 

If we get a ✓ at position 2? Then we know H is correct? Etc? 

So guessed word: ""shier"" 

Alternatively: we might have already deduced that R must be at 5? But we need to verify? 

In our case, it's deduced? 

Therefore?### Previous Feedback Analysis:
- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
  - Letters **C, A, N** are **not in the word**.  
  - **R is in the word** but not at position 2.  
  - **E is in the word** but not at position 5.  
- **Guess 2: strep** → Feedback: S(✓) T(x) R(-) E(✓) P(x)  
  - **S is at position 1** (correct and fixed).  
  - **T is not in the word**.  
  - **R is in the word** but not at position 3.  
  - **E is at position 4** (correct and fixed).  
  - **P is not in the word**.  
- **Complete deductions**:  
  - Fixed positions: **S** (pos1), **E** (pos4).  
  - **R must be at position 5** (only available position, as it cannot be at pos2 or pos3).  
  - Word structure: **S _ _ E R**.  
  - Banned letters: **C**, **A**, **N**, **T**, **P** (absent from word).  
  - Unknown positions: 2 and 3 require two new letters not banned.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Focus on **positions 2 and 3**, where new letters must be from the allowed set (e.g., B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z).  
- Maximize information by testing **common unprobed vowels/consonants** (e.g., **O**, **I**, **U**, **H**, **L**).  
- Prioritize words with **""H"" and ""I""** to cover a common vowel (I) and consonant (H).  
- **""SHIER""** fits:  
  - Conforms to the structure **S _ _ E R**.  
  - Tests ""H"" at pos2 and ""I"" at pos3.  
  - Banned letters avoided (no C,A,N,T,P).  
  - Efficiently probes letters missing from prior feedback.",Guess 3: shier -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) I(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,SOWER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any feedback yet. We want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get. It's often good to use a word with common letters and without repeating letters.

Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T, L, N). 

I'll choose a word that has a mix of vowels and consonants and uses 5 distinct letters.

One common starting word is ""CRANE"". It has three vowels (A, E) and two consonants (C, R), and it's often used because it covers common letters.

Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is also used, but let me stick with ""CRANE"".

So, for the first guess, I'll choose ""CRANE"".

Response format: <guess> crane </guess>For the first guess, I'll choose a word with common letters to maximize information gathering. A strong starting word includes multiple vowels and frequent consonants. ""CRANE"" is ideal because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 consonants (C, R, N)  
- High-frequency letters in English  
- All distinct letters (no repeats)  

This gives broad coverage of common letter positions, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently based on the feedback symbols (✓, -, x).

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
  - In ""crane"", R was in position 2 (index 1 if we start from 0), and E was in position 5 (index 4). So R is not at position 2, and E is not at position 5.
- The word does not contain C, A, or N.

We also know that R and E are present, so we have two letters to work with.

We now need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Includes R and E (since they are in the word) but in different positions than in the first guess.
- Avoids letters C, A, N since they are not in the word.
- Tries to include other common letters to test for their presence.

We have to place R and E in positions that are not the same as in ""crane"". For R, it was at position 2, so it can be at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: positions 1,3,4 for R are now possibilities. Similarly, E was at position 5, so it can be at positions 1,2,3,4.

But wait: the word is 5 letters, so positions are 1 to 5 (or indices 0 to 4). We'll use 1-based indexing for clarity.

In ""crane"":
- Position 1: C -> not in word
- Position 2: R -> in word, wrong position
- Position 3: A -> not in word
- Position 4: N -> not in word
- Position 5: E -> in word, wrong position

So for the next guess:
- We must include R, but not at position 2.
- We must include E, but not at position 5.
- We must avoid C, A, N.

Moreover, we can try to cover other vowels or common consonants. We already tested E, so perhaps we can try other vowels? The vowels we haven't tested are I, O, U. We also have consonants that are common: S, T, L, etc.

But note: we already know E is in the word, so we don't need to test it again? Actually, we do because we don't know its position. But we must not use it in position 5.

Similarly, R must not be in position 2.

Since we have limited information, we should try to use a word that contains R and E and also three new letters that are common and not yet tested (avoiding C,A,N).

What are some words that have R and E, avoiding C,A,N?

For example:
- ""TIRED"": T,I,R,E,D -> but we are placing R at position 3 (which is acceptable because it wasn't position 2) and E at position 4 (acceptable, since it wasn't position 5). Also, T, I, D are new letters.

However, let's see if we can get more common letters. Consider words with S or T.

Another idea: ""ROLES"" has R at position 1 (not 2) and E at position 5? Wait, E at position 5 is forbidden because in the first guess E was at position 5 and it was wrong position, so E cannot be at position 5? Actually, no: it could be that E is at some other position, but the feedback said it is in the word but not at position 5. We don't know that E is at position 5? Actually, the feedback means that E is in the word but the position 5 is wrong for E. Hence, E should appear in a different position in the next guess.

But ""ROLES"": 
- R at 1, O at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5? But then E is at position 4, which is allowed.

However, note we also know that A is not in the word, but O hasn't been tested yet. Similarly, L and S are new.

But ""ROLES"" might be good? Let me check the letters: R, O, L, E, S.

But we have a constraint: R must not be at position 2, which in this case it's at position 1, so okay.

However, we must be cautious: we also want to test letters that might be present. Since we know R and E are in the word, and we avoided the banned positions.

Another candidate: ""PERIL"" - P,E,R,I,L. But E is at position 2? However, we know E is in the word and we don't know the position yet. We just can't put it at position 5 because we already saw that is wrong. Putting E at position 2 is allowed? Yes, because we haven't tested position 2 for E. Similarly, R is at position 3, which is not position 2? Position 3 is new for R.

But we don't have any information about position 2 except that R is not there. So E can be at position 2? Yes.

But let me see: we have two letters we know: R and E. We need to place them in positions other than the ones we know are wrong.

Also, we must avoid C,A,N.

I think ""PRIME"" is a candidate? But wait: ""PRIME"" has P, R, I, M, E. 
- R is at position 2? Wait, position 1: P, position 2: R, position 3: I, position 4: M, position 5: E.

But we cannot put R at position 2 because the feedback said R is in the word but not at position 2. So we cannot use a word that has R at the second letter? Exactly. Therefore, ""PRIME"" is invalid because it has R at position 2.

Similarly, we cannot put E at position 5. Therefore, words that end with E must be avoided? Not necessarily. We can avoid E at position 5 and R at position 2.

How about ""STREP""? 
- S, T, R, E, P -> positions: R is at position 3 (which is not 2) and E at position 4 (not 5). So that works. 
- Also, testing S, T, P.

But ""STREP"" is a valid word? Yes, as in streptococcus, etc. But let's see: does it avoid C,A,N? Yes.

Another word: ""ADIEU"" is not good because it has A, which is not allowed. So avoiding A.

What about ""STORE""? 
- S, T, O, R, E -> R is at position 4 (not 2) and E at position 5? But putting E at position 5 is not allowed because we know E is not at position 5? Actually, we know that in the secret word, E is not at position 5. So we must not put E at position 5 in our guess? 

Wait, why? The feedback told us that in the secret word, E is not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 in our new guess and if the secret word does have E, we will get an 'x' for that position? But it's better to avoid positions we know are wrong to maximize information? Actually, we CAN put E at position 5 again, but then we know we'll get an 'x' because E cannot be at position 5? That would be inefficient because we already know E isn't at position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again? Similarly for R at position 2.

Therefore, in the next guess, we should avoid putting E in position 5 and R in position 2.

So ""STORE"" has E at position 5? So it would be inefficient? We avoid that.

Then let's consider ""STARE"": 
- But A is banned? Because feedback for A was x. So we cannot use A.

Another idea: ""QUERY"" has Q and U which are less common? Maybe not efficient.

How about ""DRIVE""? 
- D, R, I, V, E -> R at position 2 (forbidden) because in ""DRIVE"", position 2 is R? Positions: 
  1: D, 2: R -> position 2 is forbidden for R? So we cannot use words with R in the second position.

Therefore, ""DRIVE"" is invalid because R is at the second position? Exactly.

How about ""REMIT""? 
- R, E, M, I, T -> R at position 1 and E at position 2? Positions:
  1: R -> we know R is in the word, and we haven't tested position 1? Actually, in the first guess, R was at position 2 and was wrong, so position 1 is a new possibility? 
  2: E -> which we haven't tested at position 2? 

But note: we cannot put R at position 2? So as long as R is not at position 2 and E is not at position 5? In this word, R is at position 1 and E at position 2? Then E at position 2: we don't know if that might be the correct position? It could be? 

Also, the word ""REMIT"": 
- We are avoiding C,A,N. 
- Letters: R, E, M, I, T.

But E is at position 2? We have to see if that's efficient. We might test if position 1 and 2 are the correct spots? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we could choose a word where R and E are not in the same positions as in the first guess and avoid C,A,N.

Let me list some candidate words that are common and have R and E but avoid positions 2 for R and 5 for E, and avoid C,A,N.

Possible words:
- ""BRIDE"" -> but B is new? And E is at position 5? Forbidden? So not.
- ""PLIER"" -> P, L, I, E, R -> R at position 5? But we have E at position 4? So positions: 
  1: P
  2: L
  3: I
  4: E -> that's new position 4 for E
  5: R -> R at 5: which is acceptable? Because we know R is in the word and we haven't tested position 5? 

But R was at position 2 and got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not position 2. So placing R at position 5 is okay? Yes.

Similarly, E was at position 5 and got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not position 5. So in this word, E is at position 4? That's acceptable? Yes.

Therefore, ""PLIER"" is a candidate? But is ""PLIER"" a word? Yes, like a tool.

Moreover, letters: P, L, I, E, R -> avoid C,A,N? Yes.

Testing new letters: P, L, I.

Common consonants: S and T haven't been tested? Maybe we should include S or T? 

How about ""PRICE"": but has C? Not allowed? Because C is banned. So avoid.

Another word: ""SMITE"": has E at 5? Not allowed.

""STIRE"": not common? How about ""STORE"" but E at 5? Not good.

Let me think of a word with S and T? Without E at 5 or R at 2.

Example: ""STRIP"" has no E? But we have to include E? Wait, no? We have to include E? Actually, we know E is in the word? We must include E? Yes? Actually, we never have to include letters we know? But to get more information, we might choose not to? But we have 6 tries? Actually, including E and R increases the chance of getting more feedback? So it's better to include them? 

Moreover, if a letter is known to be in the word, we can test it in new positions? So it's good to include E and R again? So we should continue testing? 

Another candidate: ""TIGER"": 
- T, I, G, E, R -> E at position 4? R at position 5? 
  Position 1: T, 2: I, 3: G, 4: E (not at 5), 5: R (not at 2) -> so acceptable? 
  Also, avoids C, A, N? Yes? 
  Testing T, I, G? 

But G might be less common? But, anyway, valid word.

Another candidate: ""PRIED"": 
- P, R, I, E, D -> but R is at position 2? Forbidden? So not.

""VERGE"" has two E's? We don't know if duplicates appear? We have to be cautious? But for now, assume no duplicates? The feedback didn't show duplicates? Because in ""crane"" we had E only once? So secret word might have duplicates? But we don't know? To be safe, we can try a word without duplicates? 

But the rules don't forbid duplicates? So it's possible? But we have no information? Therefore, using distinct letters may yield more information? 

In ""PLIER"": all distinct? Yes.

In ""TIGER"": all distinct? Yes.

Which one to choose? Let me think about letter frequency.

Common letters that haven't been tested: S, T, L, O, U.

In ""PLIER"": we test L, I, P? But P is relatively common? I is a vowel? 

In ""TIGER"": T, I, G? T is very common. G is less common? 

How about ""STREW"": 
- S, T, R, E, W -> R at position 3? E at position 4? 
  Positions: 
    1: S 
    2: T 
    3: R (not 2) 
    4: E (not 5) 
    5: W 
  Avoids C,A,N? Yes. 
  Tests S, T, W? W is less common? But S and T are highly common? 

This might be better because S and T are very common? 

But does W appear in many words? Maybe? 

Another word: ""OPERA"": contains A? Not allowed? Because A is not in the word? So avoid.

""YOURS"": but has O, U? We might test O and U? However, no E? So we must include E? So it doesn't include E? We should include E? Or do we have to? 

Actually, we don't HAVE to use E and R? We can omit one? But since we know they are in the word, if we omit them, we might miss information? For example, if we guess a word without E, then we could still get feedback on other letters? But that would be inefficient? Because we already know E is in the word and should focus on its position? 

Therefore, it is better to use words that include all known letters (which are R and E) and test new positions for them, as well as new letters? 

Hence, words like ""PLIER"", ""TIGER"", and ""STREW"" are candidates? 

Also, ""FIGHT""? But no E? So avoid? 

Therefore, let's choose between: 
- PLIER: tests P, L, I (new) with E and R? 
- TIGER: tests T, I, G (new) 
- STREW: tests S, T, W (new) 
  - But S and T seem more promising? 

Also, ""STREW"" contains S and T? Which are very common? 

Another word: ""STERN"": but N is not in the word? Because N was x in the first guess? So we cannot use N? 

Similarly, ""STREP"": which we thought earlier? 
- But ""STREP"" ends with P? And E is at position 4? R at 3? 

But ""STREP"" contains S, T, E, R, P? 

Yes. 

In my list, ""STREW"" uses W? Maybe ""STREP"" is better? Because P is common? 

What about ""WREST""? 
- W, R, E, S, T -> R at position 2? Forbidden? Because R cannot be at position 2? 

Wait: ""WREST"": 
  1: W 
  2: R -> position 2 is forbidden? So invalid.

Similarly, ""ROUSE"": 
  R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5? E at 5 forbidden? 

Therefore, avoid words with R at 2 or E at 5? 

Thus, ""STREP"" seems acceptable: 
  Positions: 
  1: S 
  2: T 
  3: R (R is not at 2? Correct? It's at position 3? Which is okay) 
  4: E (not at 5? Correct? At 4? Which is okay) 
  5: P 

Also, avoids C,A,N? Yes? 

Moreover, tests S, T, P? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""STREP"" for the second guess? 

But also possible: 
- ""PIERS"": 
  1: P 
  2: I -> R not at 2? 
  3: E -> E not at 5? 
  4: R 
  5: S 
  But R is at position 4? And E at position 3? Both allowed? 

This also tests P, I, E, R, S? But E and R are already known? 

Compared to ""STREP"", ""PIERS"" has I instead of T? Which is also common? 

But T appears more? 

I think either is okay? 

Since we already know E and R, I want to put them in new positions? 

In ""crane"", R was position 2 and E position 5? 

In ""PIERS"": 
  R is at position 4 (new) 
  E is at position 3 (new) 

In ""STREP"": 
  R is at position 3 (new) 
  E is at position 4 (new) 

Both are good? 

But let me choose ""STREP"" because it has S and T? 

Alternatively, another word: ""QUERY"" is less common? Avoid Q and U? 

I think ""STREP"" is better? 

However, the word ""STREP"" is a valid English word (short for streptococcus or strep throat)? 

Yes. 

Therefore, I'll guess ""STREP"". 

But wait: is there a better word? 

Another candidate: ""GRIPE"": 
  G, R, I, P, E -> R at position 2? Forbidden? Not at position 1? But position 2 for R? No? Position 2 is R? So invalid? 

Therefore, ""GRIPE"" has R at position 2? Not allowed? 

Similarly, ""CREPT"": has C? Forbidden? 

Then, I think ""STREP"" is a good choice? 

But what about ""DIVER"": 
  D, I, V, E, R -> E at position 4? R at position 5? Both allowed? 
  Tests D, I, V? 

But V is less common? 

So ""STREP"" with S, T, P might be more informative? 

Therefore, I choose ""STREP"". 

So the next guess is ""STREP"". 

But to confirm: 
- It includes E and R? Yes. 
- R is not at position 2? It is at position 3? Yes. 
- E is not at position 5? It is at position 4? Yes. 
- Avoids C, A, N? Yes. 

Okay.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)), we know:
- The secret word contains the letters **R** and **E**, but **not** in positions 2 or 5 (based on the feedback positions in ""crane"").
- The letters **C, A, and N** are **not** in the word.
- To maximize information, the next guess should:
  - Include **R** and **E** (since they are confirmed in the word) but in **new positions** (avoid position 2 for R and position 5 for E).
  - Avoid using **C, A, N**.
  - Test new common letters (e.g., **S, T, P**) to cover more possibilities.

I chose **""strep""** as the second guess because:
- It contains **R** (position 3, not position 2) and **E** (position 4, not position 5).
- It introduces new letters: **S, T, P** (common consonants not yet tested).
- It avoids banned letters (**C, A, N**) and tests all five positions efficiently.

This guess should help determine the positions of R and E and whether S, T, or P are in the word.

<guess>strep</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: strep -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) R(-) E(✓) P(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   This tells us:
     - R is in the word but not in position 2 (index 1).
     - E is in the word but not in position 5 (index 4).
     - C, A, N are not in the word.

2. ""strep"" -> S(✓) T(x) R(-) E(✓) P(x)
   This tells us:
     - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1, index 0).
     - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, index 3). So E is fixed at position 4.
     - R is in the word but not in position 3 (index 2). Also, since we know from the first guess that R is not at position 2, and now position 3 is also wrong? So position 3 is now excluded for R? But note: in ""strep"", position 3 is R and we got a '-', meaning it is in the word but not at that position? So R cannot be at position 1? Wait, we don't know? 

Wait, let's break down:

- S at position 1: ✓ -> so the word starts with S.
- T at position 2: x -> T is not in the word? Because x means not in the word? Yes? 
- R at position 3: - -> R is in the word but not at position 3? 
- E at position 4: ✓ -> so E is at position 4? Which matches the feedback? 
- P at position 5: x -> P is not in the word? 

Important corrections:
- T is not in the word at all? So we can eliminate T? 
- P is not in the word? 

Also, we now know the word has:
- S at the start (position 1) -> fixed? 
- E at position 4 -> fixed? 
- R is in the word but cannot be at position 3? And we already know from ""crane"" that R cannot be at position 2? So R cannot be at positions 2 or 3? 

What are the possible positions for R? Positions: 1, 4, 5? But wait: 
- Position 1: We have S at position 1? So position 1 is taken? Therefore, R cannot be at position 1? 
- Position 4 is E? So that's taken? 
- Then R must be at position 5? Because positions 2 and 3 are excluded? 

Therefore, R must be at position 5? 

Also, we know E is at position 4? 

So the word so far: 
Position 1: S 
Position 2: ? (not T, and not R? And not C,A,N) 
Position 3: ? (not R? And not T,P, and not C,A,N) 
Position 4: E 
Position 5: R ? Because R must be somewhere? And only position 5 is left? 

But wait: we have two known letters: E and R? And positions? 
We have:
- E at position 4? Confirmed? 
- S at position 1? Confirmed? 

And R must be in one of the remaining positions? But we know R cannot be at position 2? Or 3? Because: 
From ""crane"": R was at position 2? And we got '-', so R is not at position 2? 
From ""strep"": R was at position 3? And we got '-', so R is not at position 3? 

And position 1 is S? Position 4 is E? Then position 5 must be R? 

Therefore, position 5 is R? 

So we can fix position 5 as R? 

Then, what about the middle? We have:
Position 2: a letter that must be in the word? Not T, not C,A,N,P? 
Position 3: a letter that must be in the word? Not T, P, and not C,A,N? 

But note: in ""crane"", we had E at position 5? But now we know E is at position 4? And position 5 is R? 

Also, we know the word begins with S, ends with R? And has E at position 4? 

So the word is: S _ _ E R 

We need to find the two middle letters? 

Constraints:
- Cannot contain T (from ""strep"": T at position 2? Got x? So T is not in the word? So eliminate T? Also, P is not in the word? 
- Cannot contain C, A, N (from first guess)? 
- So banned letters: T, C, A, N, P? 

And we need to include any other letters? 

Also, from ""crane"": we had E at position 5? But now we know E is at position 4? So the word does contain E? And R? And S? 

But what about the letters tested? In ""strep"": S, T, R, E, P? So T and P are not in the word? 

And ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E -> C, A, N not in word? 

So overall banned: C, A, N, T, P? 

So the remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

We need two of these? 

But note: we have two positions? 

Possible words: 

Let me think: common words that fit? 

Pattern: S _ _ E R 

And the missing letters must be from the allowed set? 

At this point, we could list common 5-letter words in the form S _ _ E R? 

For example:
- ""SOWER"": S, O, W, E, R -> O and W? 
- ""SUPER"": has U? But P is banned? So not? 
- ""SABER"": A is banned? 
- ""SAFER"": A banned? 
- ""SIZER"": S, I, Z, E, R? 
- ""SHEER"": H, E? But duplicates? 
- ""SKEIN"": has N? banned? 
- ""SLEER"": uncommon? 
- ""SMEAR"": M, E? But A banned? 
- ""SOBER"": O, B? 
- ""SOLER"": O, L? 
- ""SONER"": has N? 
- ""SOWER"": O, W? 

But we must avoid any letter that is banned? 

Therefore, potential letters? Let me see:

Common words: 
- ""SIXER"": S, I, X, E, R -> X is uncommon? 
- ""SIZER"": S, I, Z, E, R -> Z is less common? 

Another: ""SHRED"": 
- S, H, R, E, D? But wait: position? ""SHRED"": 
  Position 1: S? 
  Position 2: H 
  Position 3: R -> not allowed? Because we know R cannot be at position 3? And also, in ""SHRED"", R is at position 3? Which we know cannot be? Because from ""strep"" we have R at position 3 and got '-', so it's wrong? 

Oh, wait: we are now filling as S _ _ E R? So positions:
1: S
2: ? 
3: ? 
4: E
5: R

In ""SHRED"": 
  Position 3 is R? But we need position 3 to be some other letter? And position 5 is D? But we now fix position 5 as R? So ""SHRED"" would be S,H,R,E,D? So ends with D? But we need ends with R? So not? 

Therefore, the word must end with R? 

Hence, ""SABER"": invalid? 

Then let me list words that end with ""ER"" and start with ""S"", and have 5 letters? 

Common ones: 
- ""SABER"": invalid? Because A is banned? 
- ""SAPER"": P banned? 
- ""SATER"": T banned? 
- ""SAXER"": A banned? 
- ""SEWER"": E at position 2? But we have E at position 4? And word ""SEWER"": S,E,W,E,R -> duplicate E? 
    Pattern: S,E at position 2, W, E at position 4? That would require E at two places? 

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? 

But the feedback from the first guess? We had only one E? So not impossible? 

But let's see: ""SEWER"": 
  Position 1: S 
  Position 2: E? But that would be a duplicate? 
  Position 3: W 
  Position 4: E 
  Position 5: R 

And we know E is at position 4? So position 2? Could be E? But how do we know? 

We don't have information that E cannot be duplicated? But we have to consider? 

Moreover, in ""SEWER"", E is at position 2? We haven't tested position 2 yet? 

But note: we banned T? So ""SEWER"" with letters: S, E, W, E, R? 

Positions:
1: S (matches? Yes)
2: E? We don't know? 
3: W? 
4: E (matches? Yes)
5: R? We now inferred that? 

But we haven't tested position 3? 

But we also have constraints: the missing letters must not be banned? 

Banned letters: C,A,N,T,P? 

So W is not banned? 

Also, E is not banned? So duplicates? 

Therefore, ""SEWER"" is a potential? 

But let me see: another common word: ""SHIER""? But that ends with R? But pattern: S,H,I,E,R? So S at 1, H at 2, I at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 

That fits? 

Similarly: ""SIZER"": S,I,Z,E,R? 

Now, which one to choose? 

But we also need to use the feedback? 

The only letters we haven't tested? We need to test position 2 and 3? 

Since we are about to guess? We might guess ""SIXER""? But that might be uncommon? 

Alternatively, we have information? 

In the previous guesses, we didn't test H? Or I? 

But we have to avoid banned letters? 

Therefore, I think ""SHIER"" might be good? But wait: ""SHIER"" is a word? Meaning shy? 

Also, ""SKIER"": S,K,I,E,R? K is common? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we can use a word that tests more new letters? 

But we have only two positions? So the word must be of the form S X Y E R? Where X and Y are letters? And X,Y must not be C,A,N,T,P? And they must form a word? 

Possible? 
Common letters: O, W? For ""SOWER""? 
Or U? For ""SUPER""? But P banned? 
Or L? For ""SLIER""? 

Let me list common words? 
- ""SKIER"" - S,K,I,E,R? K and I? 
- ""SHOER"" - S,H,O,E,R? 
- ""SIZER"" - S,I,Z,E,R? 
- ""SOWER"" - S,O,W,E,R? 
- ""SLIER"" - S,L,I,E,R? 
- ""SUBER"" - S,U,B,E,R? B? 
- ""SUTER"" - T? banned? 

Therefore, we have several candidates: SHOER, SIZER, SKIER, SOWER, SLIER, etc? 

Now, how to choose? 

We also have the feedback from ""crane"": the word has E? Which we know? Then? 

We need to test letters? We don't have any -? 

Perhaps the best is to use a word that includes letters commonly found? Like vowels? We haven't tested many vowels? 

In the first guess? We tested A, E? So we know E is in? A is not? 

The vowels: E is present? A is absent? O, I, U are untested? 

Therefore, we might choose a word that has O and I? Or U? 

But in ""SOWER"", we have O? But no I? 

In ""SHOER"", O? 

In ""SKIER"", I? 

In ""SUBER"", U? 

We might also test common consonants? 

Since we are at guess 3, we can try to cover more letters? 

But note: we have two positions? So each guess tests two letters? 

If we get a ✓, we fix? Otherwise, we get - or x? 

Then we can proceed? 

Since we want to solve in few guesses? 

Or we can try ""SKIER"" to test K and I? 

But let me see: how about ""SHIRE""? 
Wait: ""SHIRE"": 
  S,H,I,R,E -> positions: 
    1: S? 
    2: H 
    3: I 
    4: R? -> but we know E must be at position 4? In ""SHIRE"", position 4 is R? Not E? So not? 

Similarly, ""SOLER"": S,O,L,E,R -> fits? 
But L? 

""SOLER"" is a word? 

Another one: ""BOXER"": starts with B? 

I think ""SIZER"" might be not common? 

Perhaps one of the most common is ""SKIER""? Or ""SHOER""? 

But ""SHOER"" has O? 

Since we have position 5 fixed as R? And 4 as E? And 1 as S? Then the word must be S X Y E R? 

We can choose a word that maximizes new letters? Like using two letters that are common? Maybe O and W? ""SOWER""? 

But O and W? 

Another idea: from the first guess? We had E? And R? So in ""crane"", E at position 5 was wrong? But now fixed? 

We also did not test? 

Perhaps ""SLEEK""? But ends with K? 

No? Must end with R? 

Therefore, I think ""SOWER"" is a word? Meaning someone who sows? 

But let's see: I'll choose ""SHIER"": 
- S, H, I, E, R? 
  Positions:
    1: S (fixed)
    2: H 
    3: I 
    4: E (fixed)
    5: R (fixed)

Letters: H and I are allowed? 

Similarly, ""SKIER"": S,K,I,E,R? 

Perhaps we should choose one? 

But I need to pick: let me pick ""SHIER""? 

But wait: we have to be cautious? 

Alternatively, we know more? 

Actually, we don't have information about position 3? We want to test letters? 

Perhaps we can use a word that includes a letter we think is likely? 

But without more information? 

Another thought: in ""crane"", we had E at position 5 got '-', meaning E is in the word? But we know E is fixed at position 4? Then? 

Similarly, the word only has one E? Not necessarily? 

But let's assume: there is at least one E? 

To save moves? Perhaps we should try a word that tests fewer new letters? But we have to? 

I think ""SHIER"" is fine? 

But let me try to reason: 

Known: 
- Word starts with S? 
- Ends with R? 
- Has E at position 4? 
- Banned letters: C,A,N,T,P? 
- We need to fill positions 2 and 3? 

Common vowels? Position 2: often vowels? But we know A is banned? Then E? But E is at position 4? So position 2 could be I, O, U? 

Similarly, position 3? consonants? 

Therefore, ""SHIER"" has H and I? 

But ""SOWER"" is also? 

Perhaps ""SOWER"" is better? Because it tests O and W? 

But O is common? 

Another word: ""SOLVE""? But ends with E? 

Not? 

I think I'll go with ""SHIER""? 

So guessed word: ""SHIER""? 

But wait: the feedback might help? 

We have to give one? 

Or perhaps we can choose one that covers more possibilities? 

Since we have confirmed S and E? And we think R must be at 5? Then guess 3 should be a guess that helps eliminate many possibilities? 

But we have limited options? 

Let me list possible words? 

Common words: 
- SHEER? has two E? and E at position 4? Possible? 
- SHEER: S,H,E,E,R -> 
  1:S, 2:H, 3:E? But E should be at 4? So position 3 is E? Which might be incorrect? Because E is at 4? But position 3 could be another E? 
  So ""SHEER"": 
      Pos1: S? 
      Pos2: H 
      Pos3: E? -> wrong position? Because E is at position 4? 
      But we have E at position 4? Then position 3 also E? 
  If the word has two E's? Then E at position 3 is another E? 
  And then position 4: E? -> ✓? 
  Position 5: R? 
  So possible? 

But banned letters: excluded? H is not banned? 

But forbidden by the pattern? Not really? 

Similarly, ""SHEER"" has E at position 3? And E at 4? We know E is at 4? If E is duplicated? Then E at position 3? 

But then it would be in the word? 

But we don't know? 

Therefore, we must consider? 

Or perhaps not? 

I think to be safe? We should guess a word that makes sense? 

But ""SHIER"" is acceptable? 

So I'll guess ""SHIER""? 

Therefore: <guess>shier</guess> 

But let's formalize: 

Based on feedback:

1. S is confirmed at position 1? 
2. E is confirmed at position 4? 
3. R must be at position 5 (since all other positions are taken or forbidden)? 
   Positions: 
      1: S? 
      2: cannot be R? 
      3: cannot be R? 
      4: E? 
      5: remaining position? 
4. Banned letters: C, A, N, T, P?
5. The unknown letters: position 2 and 3? Must be found and not banned? 

I use ""shier"" to test:
- Position 2: H (common letter? Allow to test H? 
- Position 3: I (common vowel) 

This will provide feedback on whether H and I are in the word and their positions? Since positions 2 and 3 are not fixed? 

If we get a ✓ at position 2? Then we know H is correct? Etc? 

So guessed word: ""shier"" 

Alternatively: we might have already deduced that R must be at 5? But we need to verify? 

In our case, it's deduced? 

Therefore?### Previous Feedback Analysis:
- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
  - Letters **C, A, N** are **not in the word**.  
  - **R is in the word** but not at position 2.  
  - **E is in the word** but not at position 5.  
- **Guess 2: strep** → Feedback: S(✓) T(x) R(-) E(✓) P(x)  
  - **S is at position 1** (correct and fixed).  
  - **T is not in the word**.  
  - **R is in the word** but not at position 3.  
  - **E is at position 4** (correct and fixed).  
  - **P is not in the word**.  
- **Complete deductions**:  
  - Fixed positions: **S** (pos1), **E** (pos4).  
  - **R must be at position 5** (only available position, as it cannot be at pos2 or pos3).  
  - Word structure: **S _ _ E R**.  
  - Banned letters: **C**, **A**, **N**, **T**, **P** (absent from word).  
  - Unknown positions: 2 and 3 require two new letters not banned.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Focus on **positions 2 and 3**, where new letters must be from the allowed set (e.g., B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z).  
- Maximize information by testing **common unprobed vowels/consonants** (e.g., **O**, **I**, **U**, **H**, **L**).  
- Prioritize words with **""H"" and ""I""** to cover a common vowel (I) and consonant (H).  
- **""SHIER""** fits:  
  - Conforms to the structure **S _ _ E R**.  
  - Tests ""H"" at pos2 and ""I"" at pos3.  
  - Banned letters avoided (no C,A,N,T,P).  
  - Efficiently probes letters missing from prior feedback.

Since it\'s the first guess, we don\'t have any feedback yet. We want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get. It\'s often good to use a word with common letters and without repeating letters.\n\nCommon letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T, L, N). \n\nI\'ll choose a word that has a mix of vowels and consonants and uses 5 distinct letters.\n\nOne common starting word is ""CRANE"". It has three vowels (A, E) and two consonants (C, R), and it\'s often used because it covers common letters.\n\nAlternatively, ""ROATE"" is also used, but let me stick with ""CRANE"".\n\nSo, for the first guess, I\'ll choose ""CRANE"".\n\nResponse format: <guess> crane </guess>For the first guess, I\'ll choose a word with common letters to maximize information gathering. A strong starting word includes multiple vowels and frequent consonants. ""CRANE"" is ideal because it contains:\n- 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 consonants (C, R, N)  \n- High-frequency letters in English  \n- All distinct letters (no repeats)  \n\nThis gives broad coverage of common letter positions, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently based on the feedback symbols (✓, -, x).\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given the feedback for the first guess ""crane"":\n- C: x (not in word)\n- R: - (in word but wrong position)\n- A: x (not in word)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- E: - (in word but wrong position)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The secret word contains R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".\n  - In ""crane"", R was in position 2 (index 1 if we start from 0), and E was in position 5 (index 4). So R is not at position 2, and E is not at position 5.\n- The word does not contain C, A, or N.\n\nWe also know that R and E are present, so we have two letters to work with.\n\nWe now need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:\n- Includes R and E (since they are in the word) but in different positions than in the first guess.\n- Avoids letters C, A, N since they are not in the word.\n- Tries to include other common letters to test for their presence.\n\nWe have to place R and E in positions that are not the same as in ""crane"". For R, it was at position 2, so it can be at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: positions 1,3,4 for R are now possibilities. Similarly, E was at position 5, so it can be at positions 1,2,3,4.\n\nBut wait: the word is 5 letters, so positions are 1 to 5 (or indices 0 to 4). We\'ll use 1-based indexing for clarity.\n\nIn ""crane"":\n- Position 1: C -> not in word\n- Position 2: R -> in word, wrong position\n- Position 3: A -> not in word\n- Position 4: N -> not in word\n- Position 5: E -> in word, wrong position\n\nSo for the next guess:\n- We must include R, but not at position 2.\n- We must include E, but not at position 5.\n- We must avoid C, A, N.\n\nMoreover, we can try to cover other vowels or common consonants. We already tested E, so perhaps we can try other vowels? The vowels we haven\'t tested are I, O, U. We also have consonants that are common: S, T, L, etc.\n\nBut note: we already know E is in the word, so we don\'t need to test it again? Actually, we do because we don\'t know its position. But we must not use it in position 5.\n\nSimilarly, R must not be in position 2.\n\nSince we have limited information, we should try to use a word that contains R and E and also three new letters that are common and not yet tested (avoiding C,A,N).\n\nWhat are some words that have R and E, avoiding C,A,N?\n\nFor example:\n- ""TIRED"": T,I,R,E,D -> but we are placing R at position 3 (which is acceptable because it wasn\'t position 2) and E at position 4 (acceptable, since it wasn\'t position 5). Also, T, I, D are new letters.\n\nHowever, let\'s see if we can get more common letters. Consider words with S or T.\n\nAnother idea: ""ROLES"" has R at position 1 (not 2) and E at position 5? Wait, E at position 5 is forbidden because in the first guess E was at position 5 and it was wrong position, so E cannot be at position 5? Actually, no: it could be that E is at some other position, but the feedback said it is in the word but not at position 5. We don\'t know that E is at position 5? Actually, the feedback means that E is in the word but the position 5 is wrong for E. Hence, E should appear in a different position in the next guess.\n\nBut ""ROLES"": \n- R at 1, O at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5? But then E is at position 4, which is allowed.\n\nHowever, note we also know that A is not in the word, but O hasn\'t been tested yet. Similarly, L and S are new.\n\nBut ""ROLES"" might be good? Let me check the letters: R, O, L, E, S.\n\nBut we have a constraint: R must not be at position 2, which in this case it\'s at position 1, so okay.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious: we also want to test letters that might be present. Since we know R and E are in the word, and we avoided the banned positions.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PERIL"" - P,E,R,I,L. But E is at position 2? However, we know E is in the word and we don\'t know the position yet. We just can\'t put it at position 5 because we already saw that is wrong. Putting E at position 2 is allowed? Yes, because we haven\'t tested position 2 for E. Similarly, R is at position 3, which is not position 2? Position 3 is new for R.\n\nBut we don\'t have any information about position 2 except that R is not there. So E can be at position 2? Yes.\n\nBut let me see: we have two letters we know: R and E. We need to place them in positions other than the ones we know are wrong.\n\nAlso, we must avoid C,A,N.\n\nI think ""PRIME"" is a candidate? But wait: ""PRIME"" has P, R, I, M, E. \n- R is at position 2? Wait, position 1: P, position 2: R, position 3: I, position 4: M, position 5: E.\n\nBut we cannot put R at position 2 because the feedback said R is in the word but not at position 2. So we cannot use a word that has R at the second letter? Exactly. Therefore, ""PRIME"" is invalid because it has R at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot put E at position 5. Therefore, words that end with E must be avoided? Not necessarily. We can avoid E at position 5 and R at position 2.\n\nHow about ""STREP""? \n- S, T, R, E, P -> positions: R is at position 3 (which is not 2) and E at position 4 (not 5). So that works. \n- Also, testing S, T, P.\n\nBut ""STREP"" is a valid word? Yes, as in streptococcus, etc. But let\'s see: does it avoid C,A,N? Yes.\n\nAnother word: ""ADIEU"" is not good because it has A, which is not allowed. So avoiding A.\n\nWhat about ""STORE""? \n- S, T, O, R, E -> R is at position 4 (not 2) and E at position 5? But putting E at position 5 is not allowed because we know E is not at position 5? Actually, we know that in the secret word, E is not at position 5. So we must not put E at position 5 in our guess? \n\nWait, why? The feedback told us that in the secret word, E is not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 in our new guess and if the secret word does have E, we will get an \'x\' for that position? But it\'s better to avoid positions we know are wrong to maximize information? Actually, we CAN put E at position 5 again, but then we know we\'ll get an \'x\' because E cannot be at position 5? That would be inefficient because we already know E isn\'t at position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again? Similarly for R at position 2.\n\nTherefore, in the next guess, we should avoid putting E in position 5 and R in position 2.\n\nSo ""STORE"" has E at position 5? So it would be inefficient? We avoid that.\n\nThen let\'s consider ""STARE"": \n- But A is banned? Because feedback for A was x. So we cannot use A.\n\nAnother idea: ""QUERY"" has Q and U which are less common? Maybe not efficient.\n\nHow about ""DRIVE""? \n- D, R, I, V, E -> R at position 2 (forbidden) because in ""DRIVE"", position 2 is R? Positions: \n  1: D, 2: R -> position 2 is forbidden for R? So we cannot use words with R in the second position.\n\nTherefore, ""DRIVE"" is invalid because R is at the second position? Exactly.\n\nHow about ""REMIT""? \n- R, E, M, I, T -> R at position 1 and E at position 2? Positions:\n  1: R -> we know R is in the word, and we haven\'t tested position 1? Actually, in the first guess, R was at position 2 and was wrong, so position 1 is a new possibility? \n  2: E -> which we haven\'t tested at position 2? \n\nBut note: we cannot put R at position 2? So as long as R is not at position 2 and E is not at position 5? In this word, R is at position 1 and E at position 2? Then E at position 2: we don\'t know if that might be the correct position? It could be? \n\nAlso, the word ""REMIT"": \n- We are avoiding C,A,N. \n- Letters: R, E, M, I, T.\n\nBut E is at position 2? We have to see if that\'s efficient. We might test if position 1 and 2 are the correct spots? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word where R and E are not in the same positions as in the first guess and avoid C,A,N.\n\nLet me list some candidate words that are common and have R and E but avoid positions 2 for R and 5 for E, and avoid C,A,N.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BRIDE"" -> but B is new? And E is at position 5? Forbidden? So not.\n- ""PLIER"" -> P, L, I, E, R -> R at position 5? But we have E at position 4? So positions: \n  1: P\n  2: L\n  3: I\n  4: E -> that\'s new position 4 for E\n  5: R -> R at 5: which is acceptable? Because we know R is in the word and we haven\'t tested position 5? \n\nBut R was at position 2 and got a \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not position 2. So placing R at position 5 is okay? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, E was at position 5 and got a \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not position 5. So in this word, E is at position 4? That\'s acceptable? Yes.\n\nTherefore, ""PLIER"" is a candidate? But is ""PLIER"" a word? Yes, like a tool.\n\nMoreover, letters: P, L, I, E, R -> avoid C,A,N? Yes.\n\nTesting new letters: P, L, I.\n\nCommon consonants: S and T haven\'t been tested? Maybe we should include S or T? \n\nHow about ""PRICE"": but has C? Not allowed? Because C is banned. So avoid.\n\nAnother word: ""SMITE"": has E at 5? Not allowed.\n\n""STIRE"": not common? How about ""STORE"" but E at 5? Not good.\n\nLet me think of a word with S and T? Without E at 5 or R at 2.\n\nExample: ""STRIP"" has no E? But we have to include E? Wait, no? We have to include E? Actually, we know E is in the word? We must include E? Yes? Actually, we never have to include letters we know? But to get more information, we might choose not to? But we have 6 tries? Actually, including E and R increases the chance of getting more feedback? So it\'s better to include them? \n\nMoreover, if a letter is known to be in the word, we can test it in new positions? So it\'s good to include E and R again? So we should continue testing? \n\nAnother candidate: ""TIGER"": \n- T, I, G, E, R -> E at position 4? R at position 5? \n  Position 1: T, 2: I, 3: G, 4: E (not at 5), 5: R (not at 2) -> so acceptable? \n  Also, avoids C, A, N? Yes? \n  Testing T, I, G? \n\nBut G might be less common? But, anyway, valid word.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PRIED"": \n- P, R, I, E, D -> but R is at position 2? Forbidden? So not.\n\n""VERGE"" has two E\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates appear? We have to be cautious? But for now, assume no duplicates? The feedback didn\'t show duplicates? Because in ""crane"" we had E only once? So secret word might have duplicates? But we don\'t know? To be safe, we can try a word without duplicates? \n\nBut the rules don\'t forbid duplicates? So it\'s possible? But we have no information? Therefore, using distinct letters may yield more information? \n\nIn ""PLIER"": all distinct? Yes.\n\nIn ""TIGER"": all distinct? Yes.\n\nWhich one to choose? Let me think about letter frequency.\n\nCommon letters that haven\'t been tested: S, T, L, O, U.\n\nIn ""PLIER"": we test L, I, P? But P is relatively common? I is a vowel? \n\nIn ""TIGER"": T, I, G? T is very common. G is less common? \n\nHow about ""STREW"": \n- S, T, R, E, W -> R at position 3? E at position 4? \n  Positions: \n    1: S \n    2: T \n    3: R (not 2) \n    4: E (not 5) \n    5: W \n  Avoids C,A,N? Yes. \n  Tests S, T, W? W is less common? But S and T are highly common? \n\nThis might be better because S and T are very common? \n\nBut does W appear in many words? Maybe? \n\nAnother word: ""OPERA"": contains A? Not allowed? Because A is not in the word? So avoid.\n\n""YOURS"": but has O, U? We might test O and U? However, no E? So we must include E? So it doesn\'t include E? We should include E? Or do we have to? \n\nActually, we don\'t HAVE to use E and R? We can omit one? But since we know they are in the word, if we omit them, we might miss information? For example, if we guess a word without E, then we could still get feedback on other letters? But that would be inefficient? Because we already know E is in the word and should focus on its position? \n\nTherefore, it is better to use words that include all known letters (which are R and E) and test new positions for them, as well as new letters? \n\nHence, words like ""PLIER"", ""TIGER"", and ""STREW"" are candidates? \n\nAlso, ""FIGHT""? But no E? So avoid? \n\nTherefore, let\'s choose between: \n- PLIER: tests P, L, I (new) with E and R? \n- TIGER: tests T, I, G (new) \n- STREW: tests S, T, W (new) \n  - But S and T seem more promising? \n\nAlso, ""STREW"" contains S and T? Which are very common? \n\nAnother word: ""STERN"": but N is not in the word? Because N was x in the first guess? So we cannot use N? \n\nSimilarly, ""STREP"": which we thought earlier? \n- But ""STREP"" ends with P? And E is at position 4? R at 3? \n\nBut ""STREP"" contains S, T, E, R, P? \n\nYes. \n\nIn my list, ""STREW"" uses W? Maybe ""STREP"" is better? Because P is common? \n\nWhat about ""WREST""? \n- W, R, E, S, T -> R at position 2? Forbidden? Because R cannot be at position 2? \n\nWait: ""WREST"": \n  1: W \n  2: R -> position 2 is forbidden? So invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""ROUSE"": \n  R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5? E at 5 forbidden? \n\nTherefore, avoid words with R at 2 or E at 5? \n\nThus, ""STREP"" seems acceptable: \n  Positions: \n  1: S \n  2: T \n  3: R (R is not at 2? Correct? It\'s at position 3? Which is okay) \n  4: E (not at 5? Correct? At 4? Which is okay) \n  5: P \n\nAlso, avoids C,A,N? Yes? \n\nMoreover, tests S, T, P? \n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""STREP"" for the second guess? \n\nBut also possible: \n- ""PIERS"": \n  1: P \n  2: I -> R not at 2? \n  3: E -> E not at 5? \n  4: R \n  5: S \n  But R is at position 4? And E at position 3? Both allowed? \n\nThis also tests P, I, E, R, S? But E and R are already known? \n\nCompared to ""STREP"", ""PIERS"" has I instead of T? Which is also common? \n\nBut T appears more? \n\nI think either is okay? \n\nSince we already know E and R, I want to put them in new positions? \n\nIn ""crane"", R was position 2 and E position 5? \n\nIn ""PIERS"": \n  R is at position 4 (new) \n  E is at position 3 (new) \n\nIn ""STREP"": \n  R is at position 3 (new) \n  E is at position 4 (new) \n\nBoth are good? \n\nBut let me choose ""STREP"" because it has S and T? \n\nAlternatively, another word: ""QUERY"" is less common? Avoid Q and U? \n\nI think ""STREP"" is better? \n\nHowever, the word ""STREP"" is a valid English word (short for streptococcus or strep throat)? \n\nYes. \n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""STREP"". \n\nBut wait: is there a better word? \n\nAnother candidate: ""GRIPE"": \n  G, R, I, P, E -> R at position 2? Forbidden? Not at position 1? But position 2 for R? No? Position 2 is R? So invalid? \n\nTherefore, ""GRIPE"" has R at position 2? Not allowed? \n\nSimilarly, ""CREPT"": has C? Forbidden? \n\nThen, I think ""STREP"" is a good choice? \n\nBut what about ""DIVER"": \n  D, I, V, E, R -> E at position 4? R at position 5? Both allowed? \n  Tests D, I, V? \n\nBut V is less common? \n\nSo ""STREP"" with S, T, P might be more informative? \n\nTherefore, I choose ""STREP"". \n\nSo the next guess is ""STREP"". \n\nBut to confirm: \n- It includes E and R? Yes. \n- R is not at position 2? It is at position 3? Yes. \n- E is not at position 5? It is at position 4? Yes. \n- Avoids C, A, N? Yes. \n\nOkay.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)), we know:\n- The secret word contains the letters **R** and **E**, but **not** in positions 2 or 5 (based on the feedback positions in ""crane"").\n- The letters **C, A, and N** are **not** in the word.\n- To maximize information, the next guess should:\n  - Include **R** and **E** (since they are confirmed in the word) but in **new positions** (avoid position 2 for R and position 5 for E).\n  - Avoid using **C, A, N**.\n  - Test new common letters (e.g., **S, T, P**) to cover more possibilities.\n\nI chose **""strep""** as the second guess because:\n- It contains **R** (position 3, not position 2) and **E** (position 4, not position 5).\n- It introduces new letters: **S, T, P** (common consonants not yet tested).\n- It avoids banned letters (**C, A, N**) and tests all five positions efficiently.\n\nThis guess should help determine the positions of R and E and whether S, T, or P are in the word.\n\n<guess>strep</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: strep -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) R(-) E(✓) P(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\n1.

""strep"" -> S(✓) T(x) R(-) E(✓) P(x)\n   This tells us:\n     - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1, index 0).\n     - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, index 3). So E is fixed at position 4.\n     - R is in the word but not in position 3 (index 2). Also, since we know from the first guess that R is not at position 2, and now position 3 is also wrong? So position 3 is now excluded for R? But note: in ""strep"", position 3 is R and we got a \'-\', meaning it is in the word but not at that position? So R cannot be at position 1? Wait, we don\'t know? \n\nWait, let\'s break down:\n\n- S at position 1: ✓ -> so the word starts with S.\n- T at position 2: x -> T is not in the word? Because x means not in the word? Yes? \n- R at position 3: - -> R is in the word but not at position 3? \n- E at position 4: ✓ -> so E is at position 4? Which matches the feedback? \n- P at position 5: x -> P is not in the word? \n\nImportant corrections:\n- T is not in the word at all? So we can eliminate T? \n- P is not in the word? \n\nAlso, we now know the word has:\n- S at the start (position 1) -> fixed? \n- E at position 4 -> fixed? \n- R is in the word but cannot be at position 3? And we already know from ""crane"" that R cannot be at position 2? So R cannot be at positions 2 or 3? \n\nWhat are the possible positions for R? Positions: 1, 4, 5? But wait: \n- Position 1: We have S at position 1? So position 1 is taken? Therefore, R cannot be at position 1? \n- Position 4 is E? So that\'s taken? \n- Then R must be at position 5? Because positions 2 and 3 are excluded? \n\nTherefore, R must be at position 5? \n\nAlso, we know E is at position 4? \n\nSo the word so far: \nPosition 1: S \nPosition 2: ? (not T, and not R? And not C,A,N) \nPosition 3: ? (not R? And not T,P, and not C,A,N) \nPosition 4: E \nPosition 5: R ? Because R must be somewhere? And only position 5 is left? \n\nBut wait: we have two known letters: E and R? And positions? \nWe have:\n- E at position 4? Confirmed? \n- S at position 1? Confirmed? \n\nAnd R must be in one of the remaining positions? But we know R cannot be at position 2? Or 3? Because: \nFrom ""crane"": R was at position 2? And we got \'-\', so R is not at position 2? \nFrom ""strep"": R was at position 3? And we got \'-\', so R is not at position 3? \n\nAnd position 1 is S? Position 4 is E? Then position 5 must be R? \n\nTherefore, position 5 is R? \n\nSo we can fix position 5 as R? \n\nThen, what about the middle? We have:\nPosition 2: a letter that must be in the word? Not T, not C,A,N,P? \nPosition 3: a letter that must be in the word? Not T, P, and not C,A,N? \n\nBut note: in ""crane"", we had E at position 5? But now we know E is at position 4? And position 5 is R? \n\nAlso, we know the word begins with S, ends with R? And has E at position 4? \n\nSo the word is: S _ _ E R \n\nWe need to find the two middle letters? \n\nConstraints:\n- Cannot contain T (from ""strep"": T at position 2? Got x? So T is not in the word? So eliminate T? Also, P is not in the word? \n- Cannot contain C, A, N (from first guess)? \n- So banned letters: T, C, A, N, P? \n\nAnd we need to include any other letters? \n\nAlso, from ""crane"": we had E at position 5? But now we know E is at position 4? So the word does contain E? And R? And S? \n\nBut what about the letters tested? In ""strep"": S, T, R, E, P? So T and P are not in the word? \n\nAnd ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E -> C, A, N not in word? \n\nSo overall banned: C, A, N, T, P? \n\nSo the remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? \n\nWe need two of these? \n\nBut note: we have two positions? \n\nPossible words: \n\nLet me think: common words that fit? \n\nPattern: S _ _ E R \n\nAnd the missing letters must be from the allowed set? \n\nAt this point, we could list common 5-letter words in the form S _ _ E R? \n\nFor example:\n- ""SOWER"": S, O, W, E, R -> O and W? \n- ""SUPER"": has U? But P is banned? So not? \n- ""SABER"": A is banned? \n- ""SAFER"": A banned? \n- ""SIZER"": S, I, Z, E, R? \n- ""SHEER"": H, E? But duplicates? \n- ""SKEIN"": has N? banned? \n- ""SLEER"": uncommon? \n- ""SMEAR"": M, E? But A banned? \n- ""SOBER"": O, B? \n- ""SOLER"": O, L? \n- ""SONER"": has N? \n- ""SOWER"": O, W? \n\nBut we must avoid any letter that is banned? \n\nTherefore, potential letters? Let me see:\n\nCommon words: \n- ""SIXER"": S, I, X, E, R -> X is uncommon? \n- ""SIZER"": S, I, Z, E, R -> Z is less common? \n\nAnother: ""SHRED"": \n- S, H, R, E, D? But wait: position? ""SHRED"": \n  Position 1: S? \n  Position 2: H \n  Position 3: R -> not allowed? Because we know R cannot be at position 3? And also, in ""SHRED"", R is at position 3? Which we know cannot be? Because from ""strep"" we have R at position 3 and got \'-\', so it\'s wrong? \n\nOh, wait: we are now filling as S _ _ E R? So positions:\n1: S\n2: ? \n3: ? \n4: E\n5: R\n\nIn ""SHRED"": \n  Position 3 is R? But we need position 3 to be some other letter? And position 5 is D? But we now fix position 5 as R? So ""SHRED"" would be S,H,R,E,D? So ends with D? But we need ends with R? So not? \n\nTherefore, the word must end with R? \n\nHence, ""SABER"": invalid? \n\nThen let me list words that end with ""ER"" and start with ""S"", and have 5 letters? \n\nCommon ones: \n- ""SABER"": invalid? Because A is banned? \n- ""SAPER"": P banned? \n- ""SATER"": T banned? \n- ""SAXER"": A banned? \n- ""SEWER"": E at position 2? But we have E at position 4? And word ""SEWER"": S,E,W,E,R -> duplicate E? \n    Pattern: S,E at position 2, W, E at position 4? That would require E at two places? \n\nBut we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? \n\nBut the feedback from the first guess? We had only one E? So not impossible? \n\nBut let\'s see: ""SEWER"": \n  Position 1: S \n  Position 2: E? But that would be a duplicate? \n  Position 3: W \n  Position 4: E \n  Position 5: R \n\nAnd we know E is at position 4? So position 2? Could be E? But how do we know? \n\nWe don\'t have information that E cannot be duplicated? But we have to consider? \n\nMoreover, in ""SEWER"", E is at position 2? We haven\'t tested position 2 yet? \n\nBut note: we banned T? So ""SEWER"" with letters: S, E, W, E, R? \n\nPositions:\n1: S (matches? Yes)\n2: E? We don\'t know? \n3: W? \n4: E (matches? Yes)\n5: R? We now inferred that? \n\nBut we haven\'t tested position 3? \n\nBut we also have constraints: the missing letters must not be banned? \n\nBanned letters: C,A,N,T,P? \n\nSo W is not banned? \n\nAlso, E is not banned? So duplicates? \n\nTherefore, ""SEWER"" is a potential? \n\nBut let me see: another common word: ""SHIER""? But that ends with R? But pattern: S,H,I,E,R? So S at 1, H at 2, I at 3, E at 4, R at 5? \n\nThat fits? \n\nSimilarly: ""SIZER"": S,I,Z,E,R? \n\nNow, which one to choose? \n\nBut we also need to use the feedback? \n\nThe only letters we haven\'t tested? We need to test position 2 and 3? \n\nSince we are about to guess? We might guess ""SIXER""? But that might be uncommon? \n\nAlternatively, we have information? \n\nIn the previous guesses, we didn\'t test H? Or I? \n\nBut we have to avoid banned letters? \n\nTherefore, I think ""SHIER"" might be good? But wait: ""SHIER"" is a word? Meaning shy? \n\nAlso, ""SKIER"": S,K,I,E,R? K is common? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that tests more new letters? \n\nBut we have only two positions? So the word must be of the form S X Y E R? Where X and Y are letters? And X,Y must not be C,A,N,T,P? And they must form a word? \n\nPossible? \nCommon letters: O, W? For ""SOWER""? \nOr U? For ""SUPER""? But P banned? \nOr L? For ""SLIER""? \n\nLet me list common words? \n- ""SKIER"" - S,K,I,E,R? K and I? \n- ""SHOER"" - S,H,O,E,R? \n- ""SIZER"" - S,I,Z,E,R? \n- ""SOWER"" - S,O,W,E,R? \n- ""SLIER"" - S,L,I,E,R? \n- ""SUBER"" - S,U,B,E,R? B? \n- ""SUTER"" - T? banned? \n\nTherefore, we have several candidates: SHOER, SIZER, SKIER, SOWER, SLIER, etc? \n\nNow, how to choose? \n\nWe also have the feedback from ""crane"": the word has E? Which we know? Then? \n\nWe need to test letters? We don\'t have any -? \n\nPerhaps the best is to use a word that includes letters commonly found? Like vowels? We haven\'t tested many vowels? \n\nIn the first guess? We tested A, E? So we know E is in? A is not? \n\nThe vowels: E is present? A is absent? O, I, U are untested? \n\nTherefore, we might choose a word that has O and I? Or U? \n\nBut in ""SOWER"", we have O? But no I? \n\nIn ""SHOER"", O? \n\nIn ""SKIER"", I? \n\nIn ""SUBER"", U? \n\nWe might also test common consonants? \n\nSince we are at guess 3, we can try to cover more letters? \n\nBut note: we have two positions? So each guess tests two letters? \n\nIf we get a ✓, we fix? Otherwise, we get - or x? \n\nThen we can proceed? \n\nSince we want to solve in few guesses? \n\nOr we can try ""SKIER"" to test K and I? \n\nBut let me see: how about ""SHIRE""? \nWait: ""SHIRE"": \n  S,H,I,R,E -> positions: \n    1: S? \n    2: H \n    3: I \n    4: R? -> but we know E must be at position 4? In ""SHIRE"", position 4 is R? Not E? So not? \n\nSimilarly, ""SOLER"": S,O,L,E,R -> fits? \nBut L? \n\n""SOLER"" is a word? \n\nAnother one: ""BOXER"": starts with B? \n\nI think ""SIZER"" might be not common? \n\nPerhaps one of the most common is ""SKIER""? Or ""SHOER""? \n\nBut ""SHOER"" has O? \n\nSince we have position 5 fixed as R? And 4 as E? And 1 as S? Then the word must be S X Y E R? \n\nWe can choose a word that maximizes new letters? Like using two letters that are common? Maybe O and W? ""SOWER""? \n\nBut O and W? \n\nAnother idea: from the first guess? We had E? And R? So in ""crane"", E at position 5 was wrong? But now fixed? \n\nWe also did not test? \n\nPerhaps ""SLEEK""? But ends with K? \n\nNo? Must end with R? \n\nTherefore, I think ""SOWER"" is a word? Meaning someone who sows? \n\nBut let\'s see: I\'ll choose ""SHIER"": \n- S, H, I, E, R? \n  Positions:\n    1: S (fixed)\n    2: H \n    3: I \n    4: E (fixed)\n    5: R (fixed)\n\nLetters: H and I are allowed? \n\nSimilarly, ""SKIER"": S,K,I,E,R? \n\nPerhaps we should choose one? \n\nBut I need to pick: let me pick ""SHIER""? \n\nBut wait: we have to be cautious? \n\nAlternatively, we know more? \n\nActually, we don\'t have information about position 3? We want to test letters? \n\nPerhaps we can use a word that includes a letter we think is likely? \n\nBut without more information? \n\nAnother thought: in ""crane"", we had E at position 5 got \'-\', meaning E is in the word? But we know E is fixed at position 4? Then? \n\nSimilarly, the word only has one E? Not necessarily? \n\nBut let\'s assume: there is at least one E? \n\nTo save moves? Perhaps we should try a word that tests fewer new letters? But we have to? \n\nI think ""SHIER"" is fine? \n\nBut let me try to reason: \n\nKnown: \n- Word starts with S? \n- Ends with R? \n- Has E at position 4? \n- Banned letters: C,A,N,T,P? \n- We need to fill positions 2 and 3? \n\nCommon vowels? Position 2: often vowels? But we know A is banned? Then E? But E is at position 4? So position 2 could be I, O, U? \n\nSimilarly, position 3? consonants? \n\nTherefore, ""SHIER"" has H and I? \n\nBut ""SOWER"" is also? \n\nPerhaps ""SOWER"" is better? Because it tests O and W? \n\nBut O is common? \n\nAnother word: ""SOLVE""? But ends with E? \n\nNot? \n\nI think I\'ll go with ""SHIER""? \n\nSo guessed word: ""SHIER""? \n\nBut wait: the feedback might help? \n\nWe have to give one? \n\nOr perhaps we can choose one that covers more possibilities? \n\nSince we have confirmed S and E? And we think R must be at 5? Then guess 3 should be a guess that helps eliminate many possibilities? \n\nBut we have limited options? \n\nLet me list possible words? \n\nCommon words: \n- SHEER? has two E? and E at position 4? Possible? \n- SHEER: S,H,E,E,R -> \n  1:S, 2:H, 3:E? But E should be at 4? So position 3 is E? Which might be incorrect? Because E is at 4? But position 3 could be another E? \n  So ""SHEER"": \n      Pos1: S? \n      Pos2: H \n      Pos3: E? -> wrong position? Because E is at position 4? \n      But we have E at position 4? Then position 3 also E? \n  If the word has two E\'s? Then E at position 3 is another E? \n  And then position 4: E? -> ✓? \n  Position 5: R? \n  So possible? \n\nBut banned letters: excluded? H is not banned? \n\nBut forbidden by the pattern? Not really? \n\nSimilarly, ""SHEER"" has E at position 3? And E at 4? We know E is at 4? If E is duplicated? Then E at position 3? \n\nBut then it would be in the word? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nTherefore, we must consider? \n\nOr perhaps not? \n\nI think to be safe? We should guess a word that makes sense? \n\nBut ""SHIER"" is acceptable? \n\nSo I\'ll guess ""SHIER""? \n\nTherefore: <guess>shier</guess> \n\nBut let\'s formalize: \n\nBased on feedback:\n\n1. S is confirmed at position 1? \n2. E is confirmed at position 4? \n3. R must be at position 5 (since all other positions are taken or forbidden)? \n   Positions: \n      1: S? \n      2: cannot be R? \n      3: cannot be R? \n      4: E? \n      5: remaining position? \n4. Banned letters: C, A, N, T, P?\n5. The unknown letters: position 2 and 3? Must be found and not banned? \n\nI use ""shier"" to test:\n- Position 2: H (common letter? Allow to test H? \n- Position 3: I (common vowel) \n\nThis will provide feedback on whether H and I are in the word and their positions? Since positions 2 and 3 are not fixed? \n\nIf we get a ✓ at position 2? Then we know H is correct? Etc? \n\nSo guessed word: ""shier"" \n\nAlternatively: we might have already deduced that R must be at 5? But we need to verify? \n\nIn our case, it\'s deduced? \n\nTherefore?### Previous Feedback Analysis:\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)  \n  - Letters **C, A, N** are **not in the word**.  \n  - **R is in the word** but not at position 2.  \n  - **E is in the word** but not at position 5.  \n- **Guess 2: strep** → Feedback: S(✓) T(x) R(-) E(✓) P(x)  \n  - **S is at position 1** (correct and fixed).  \n  - **T is not in the word**.  \n  - **R is in the word** but not at position 3.  \n  - **E is at position 4** (correct and fixed).  \n  - **P is not in the word**.  \n- **Complete deductions**:  \n  - Fixed positions: **S** (pos1), **E** (pos4).  \n  - **R must be at position 5** (only available position, as it cannot be at pos2 or pos3).  \n  - Word structure: **S _ _ E R**.  \n  - Banned letters: **C**, **A**, **N**, **T**, **P** (absent from word).  \n  - Unknown positions: 2 and 3 require two new letters not banned.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Focus on **positions 2 and 3**, where new letters must be from the allowed set (e.g., B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z).  \n- Maximize information by testing **common unprobed vowels/consonants** (e.g., **O**, **I**, **U**, **H**, **L**).  \n- Prioritize words with **""H"" and ""I""** to cover a common vowel (I) and consonant (H).  \n- **""SHIER""** fits:  \n  - Conforms to the structure **S _ _ E R**.  \n  - Tests ""H"" at pos2 and ""I"" at pos3.  \n  - Banned letters avoided (no C,A,N,T,P).  \n  - Efficiently probes letters missing from prior feedback.\n\n<guess>shier</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: strep -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) R(-) E(✓) P(x)\nGuess 3: shier -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) I(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

**Guess 1: crane**
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)

Deductions:
- R and E are in the word, but R not at position 2 (index 1), E not at position 5 (index 4).
- C, A, N are not in the word.

**Guess 2: strep**
- S: ✓ (correct and in position 1)
- T: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, but not at position 3)
- E: ✓ (correct and in position 4)
- P: x (not in word)

Deductions:
- S is fixed at position 1.
- E is fixed at position 4.
- T and P are not in the word.
- R is in the word, but cannot be at position 3 (index 2). Combined with Guess 1, R cannot be at position 2 (index 1) or 3 (from this feedback).

**Guess 3: shier**
- S: ✓ (correct at position 1)
- H: x (not in word)
- I: x (not in word)
- E: ✓ (correct at position 4)
- R: ✓ (correct at position 5)

Deductions:
- R is fixed at position 5. This matches our previous deduction that R must be at position 5 (since it couldn't be at 2 or 3, and 1 and 4 were taken by S and E).
- H and I are not in the word.

**Summary of current knowledge**:
- Fixed letters and positions:
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: R
- Banned letters (not in the word): C, A, N, T, P, H, I
- The word structure is: S _ _ E R (with positions 2 and 3 unknown)
- Position 2 and 3 must be filled with letters not banned. Remaining possible letters are B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to find a word of the form S X Y E R, where X and Y are letters from the allowed set, and the word must be valid English.

We also have that R is at position 5? That is fixed? And E at position 4? Fixed? Then we only need to find positions 2 and 3? 

But let's verify: position 1: S (fixed), position 4: E (fixed), position 5: R (fixed). Then positions 2 and 3 are to be determined? 

We know:
- The secret word has the form: S [letter1] [letter2] E R

And letter1 and letter2 must be two letters not in {C,A,N,T,P,H,I}, and possibly distinct? But duplicates allowed? We haven't seen a duplicate yet? 

So we must choose from the allowed set: not banned? 

Possible words: 
- Select two letters from the allowed set and plug them? 

Common English words that fit this pattern:

Examples:
- ""SOWER"": S O W E R? Which? 
- ""SUBER"": S U B E R? 
- ""SEDGE"": but G? And ends with E? Not? Must end with R? 
- ""SOLER"": S O L E R? 
- ""SLEER"": S L E E R? But two E's? 
- ""SKEWER"": too long? Must be 5 letters? 
- ""SKIER"": but I is banned? Now? 
- ""SHOER"": H? banned? 

Given we just learned H and I are banned? Then? 

""SHIER"" is guessed? And we got H and I as x? So not in the word? 

Therefore, ""SOWER"": 
  O not banned? 
  W not banned? 
And ""SOWER"" is a valid word? Meaning someone who sows? 

Similarly: 
  ""SOLVE"": ends with E? 
  ""SOBER"": B? 
  ""SOFER"": O, F? 

But ""SOWER"": O and W? 

Another: ""SWEER""? Not common? 

Or ""SMEER""? Not common? 

Then ""SOWER"" seems common? 

Also: ""SUKER"": U, K? 

But ""SUKER"" might be less common? 

""SOLER"": O, L? 

""SOLER"" is a word? 

Let me decide: ""SOWER"" tests O and W? 

But O and W are common? 

Therefore, I'll guess ""SOWER""? 

But we have to confirm? 

Pattern: S O W E R? 
  Position 2: O? 
  Position 3: W? 

And positions 1: S, 4: E, 5: R? Fits? 

So guessed word? 

Therefore: <guess>sower</guess> 

But we have two positions? We are guessing two new letters? O and W? 

If we get ✓? Then we solve? But if not? Then next? 

Given the constraints? There are only a few words? We might have: 
- S O L E R? 
- S O W E R? 
- S U B E R? 
- S J E E R? Unlikely? 

But we can list? But for now? I think ""SOWER"" is a reasonable guess? 

So final decision? 

Yes?### Updated Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Pos1: **S**  
  - Pos4: **E**  
  - Pos5: **R**  
- **Banned letters**: C, A, N, T, P, H, I (absent from feedback).  
- **Word pattern**: **S _ _ E R** (positions 2 and 3 unknown).  
- **Allowed letters**: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Only **positions 2 and 3** need solving.  
- Prioritize **common words** fitting the pattern **S X Y E R**, testing frequent allowed letters like **O, W, L, B, U**.  
- **""Sower""** is ideal:  
  - Valid English word (meaning ""one who sows seeds"").  
  - Tests **O** (common vowel) at pos2 and **W** (common consonant) at pos3.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on O/W positions reveals alternatives (e.g., ""SOLER"", ""SUBER"").  

If correct, puzzle solved; if not, precise positional feedback reduces possibilities further.

<guess>sower</guess>
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

1. **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
   - **Key deductions**:  
     - R and E are in the word (R not at position 2, E not at position 5).  
     - C, A, N are not in the word.  

2. **Guess 2: strep** → Feedback: S(✓) T(x) R(-) E(✓) P(x)  
   - **Key deductions**:  
     - S is at position 1 (fixed).  
     - E is at position 4 (fixed).  
     - T and P are not in the word.  
     - R is in the word but not at position 3 (and not position 2 from Guess 1).  

3. **Guess 3: shier** → Feedback: S(✓) H(x) I(x) E(✓) R(✓)  
   - **Key deductions**:  
     - R is fixed at position 5 (only remaining position available).  
     - H and I are not in the word.  
     - Word structure is now **S _ _ E R** (positions 2 and 3 unknown).  
     - **Banned letters**: C, A, N, T, P, H, I.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Fixed letters/positions**:  
  - Pos1: **S**  
  - Pos4: **E**  
  - Pos5: **R**  
- **Banned letters**: C, A, N, T, P, H, I.  
- **Remaining possibilities**: Positions 2 and 3 must be filled with letters from: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
- **Possible words**: Common English words fitting **S X Y E R** include:  
  - **SOWER** (O/W), **SOLER** (O/L), **SUBER** (U/B), **SKEWER** (invalid length, discard).  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Prioritize **""sower""** to test **O** (common vowel) at position 2 and **W** (common consonant) at position 3.  
- If correct, solved. If not, feedback on O/W positions covers alternatives (e.g., O/W missing → try ""SOLER"" or ""SUBER"").  
- ""Sower"" ensures efficiency by probing frequent letters and leveraging pattern constraints.

<guess>sower</guess>",sower,"We have feedback from three guesses:

**Guess 1: crane**
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)

Deductions:
- R and E are in the word, but R not at position 2 (index 1), E not at position 5 (index 4).
- C, A, N are not in the word.

**Guess 2: strep**
- S: ✓ (correct and in position 1)
- T: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, but not at position 3)
- E: ✓ (correct and in position 4)
- P: x (not in word)

Deductions:
- S is fixed at position 1.
- E is fixed at position 4.
- T and P are not in the word.
- R is in the word, but cannot be at position 3 (index 2). Combined with Guess 1, R cannot be at position 2 (index 1) or 3 (from this feedback).

**Guess 3: shier**
- S: ✓ (correct at position 1)
- H: x (not in word)
- I: x (not in word)
- E: ✓ (correct at position 4)
- R: ✓ (correct at position 5)

Deductions:
- R is fixed at position 5. This matches our previous deduction that R must be at position 5 (since it couldn't be at 2 or 3, and 1 and 4 were taken by S and E).
- H and I are not in the word.

**Summary of current knowledge**:
- Fixed letters and positions:
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: R
- Banned letters (not in the word): C, A, N, T, P, H, I
- The word structure is: S _ _ E R (with positions 2 and 3 unknown)
- Position 2 and 3 must be filled with letters not banned. Remaining possible letters are B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to find a word of the form S X Y E R, where X and Y are letters from the allowed set, and the word must be valid English.

We also have that R is at position 5? That is fixed? And E at position 4? Fixed? Then we only need to find positions 2 and 3? 

But let's verify: position 1: S (fixed), position 4: E (fixed), position 5: R (fixed). Then positions 2 and 3 are to be determined? 

We know:
- The secret word has the form: S [letter1] [letter2] E R

And letter1 and letter2 must be two letters not in {C,A,N,T,P,H,I}, and possibly distinct? But duplicates allowed? We haven't seen a duplicate yet? 

So we must choose from the allowed set: not banned? 

Possible words: 
- Select two letters from the allowed set and plug them? 

Common English words that fit this pattern:

Examples:
- ""SOWER"": S O W E R? Which? 
- ""SUBER"": S U B E R? 
- ""SEDGE"": but G? And ends with E? Not? Must end with R? 
- ""SOLER"": S O L E R? 
- ""SLEER"": S L E E R? But two E's? 
- ""SKEWER"": too long? Must be 5 letters? 
- ""SKIER"": but I is banned? Now? 
- ""SHOER"": H? banned? 

Given we just learned H and I are banned? Then? 

""SHIER"" is guessed? And we got H and I as x? So not in the word? 

Therefore, ""SOWER"": 
  O not banned? 
  W not banned? 
And ""SOWER"" is a valid word? Meaning someone who sows? 

Similarly: 
  ""SOLVE"": ends with E? 
  ""SOBER"": B? 
  ""SOFER"": O, F? 

But ""SOWER"": O and W? 

Another: ""SWEER""? Not common? 

Or ""SMEER""? Not common? 

Then ""SOWER"" seems common? 

Also: ""SUKER"": U, K? 

But ""SUKER"" might be less common? 

""SOLER"": O, L? 

""SOLER"" is a word? 

Let me decide: ""SOWER"" tests O and W? 

But O and W are common? 

Therefore, I'll guess ""SOWER""? 

But we have to confirm? 

Pattern: S O W E R? 
  Position 2: O? 
  Position 3: W? 

And positions 1: S, 4: E, 5: R? Fits? 

So guessed word? 

Therefore: <guess>sower</guess> 

But we have two positions? We are guessing two new letters? O and W?

- **Banned letters**: C, A, N, T, P, H, I (absent from feedback).  
- **Word pattern**: **S _ _ E R** (positions 2 and 3 unknown).  
- **Allowed letters**: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Only **positions 2 and 3** need solving.  
- Prioritize **common words** fitting the pattern **S X Y E R**, testing frequent allowed letters like **O, W, L, B, U**.  
- **""Sower""** is ideal:  
  - Valid English word (meaning ""one who sows seeds"").  
  - Tests **O** (common vowel) at pos2 and **W** (common consonant) at pos3.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on O/W positions reveals alternatives (e.g., ""SOLER"", ""SUBER"").  

If correct, puzzle solved; if not, precise positional feedback reduces possibilities further.

<guess>sower</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

1. **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
   - **Key deductions**:  
     - R and E are in the word (R not at position 2, E not at position 5).  
     - C, A, N are not in the word.  

2. **Guess 2: strep** → Feedback: S(✓) T(x) R(-) E(✓) P(x)  
   - **Key deductions**:  
     - S is at position 1 (fixed).  
     - E is at position 4 (fixed).  
     - T and P are not in the word.  
     - R is in the word but not at position 3 (and not position 2 from Guess 1).  

3. **Guess 3: shier** → Feedback: S(✓) H(x) I(x) E(✓) R(✓)  
   - **Key deductions**:  
     - R is fixed at position 5 (only remaining position available).  
     - H and I are not in the word.  
     - Word structure is now **S _ _ E R** (positions 2 and 3 unknown).  
     - **Banned letters**: C, A, N, T, P, H, I.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Fixed letters/positions**:  
  - Pos1: **S**  
  - Pos4: **E**  
  - Pos5: **R**  
- **Banned letters**: C, A, N, T, P, H, I.  
- **Remaining possibilities**: Positions 2 and 3 must be filled with letters from: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
- **Possible words**: Common English words fitting **S X Y E R** include:  
  - **SOWER** (O/W), **SOLER** (O/L), **SUBER** (U/B), **SKEWER** (invalid length, discard).  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Prioritize **""sower""** to test **O** (common vowel) at position 2 and **W** (common consonant) at position 3.  
- If correct, solved. If not, feedback on O/W positions covers alternatives (e.g., O/W missing → try ""SOLER"" or ""SUBER"").  
- ""Sower"" ensures efficiency by probing frequent letters and leveraging pattern constraints.",Guess 4: sower -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(✓) W(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
