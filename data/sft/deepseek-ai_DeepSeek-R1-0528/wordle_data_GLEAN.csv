We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to make an initial guess.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C and R are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters A, N, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".

Since ""crane"" had A in the 3rd position, N in the 4th, and E in the 5th, and they are in the word but not in those positions, we must place them elsewhere.

We also know that the secret word does not contain C or R.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Does not include C or R (since they are absent)
- Includes A, N, and E (because they are present) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
- We can include two new letters to test.

We have to avoid the positions for A, N, E as in the first guess? Actually, the feedback says they are in the word but not in those positions, so in the new guess we can try them in different positions.

But note: the feedback does not prevent us from trying the same letter again in a different position? Actually, we know A, N, E are in the word, so we can try to place them in other positions to find the correct one.

We also have two more letters to guess? The word is 5 letters, so we have two more letters that we don't know.

We should choose a word that:
- Contains A, N, E (since they are in the word) but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively? Actually, we can try A in a different position, same for N and E.

But note: the feedback doesn't tell us that the same letter might appear multiple times? However, in this feedback, we don't have any duplicate letters in ""crane"", so we don't know about duplicates. But we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don't say they are unique.

But in the example, they were unique. However, we should be cautious.

Given that A, N, E are in the word, and we have two more letters to find.

We also know that the word does not have C or R.

Let's think of words that have A, N, E and two other letters that are not C or R.

We can try to put A, N, E in positions that are not 3, 4, 5? Actually, we can try any position except the ones we know are wrong? But note: we don't know the correct positions yet.

We have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for these letters? Actually, the feedback for A says it is in the word but not in position 3. Similarly, N is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

So in the new guess, we can try:
- A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5? But note: we have to form a valid word.
- Similarly for N and E.

We also have two new letters to include.

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.

But we also want to test the positions for A, N, E.

Let me try to think of a word that has A, N, E and two new consonants (since vowels are A and E, we might need more consonants).

Common letters: we can try to use S, T, L, etc.

But note: we have to avoid C and R.

Let me think of words that contain A, N, E and two other letters (not C or R).

Possible words:

- ""SAINT"": has S, A, I, N, T -> but note: we have A, N, and E? No, it doesn't have E. So not.

- ""SANE"": but that's 4 letters. We need 5.

- ""LEARN"": but L, E, A, R, N -> but R is not allowed (we know R is absent). So we cannot use R.

- ""LEANT"": L, E, A, N, T -> this has E, A, N, and T and L. And no C or R.

But note: in ""leant"", the positions are:
L (1), E (2), A (3), N (4), T (5)

But in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting A in position 3 again? That would be the same position. We know A is not in position 3, so we should avoid that.

So we cannot put A in position 3 again.

Similarly, we cannot put N in position 4 (because in ""crane"" it was in 4 and was wrong) and E in position 5 (same reason).

So in ""leant"", if we put A in 3 (which we know is wrong) and N in 4 (also wrong) and E in 2? But E in 2 is a new position.

But we cannot use the same position for A and N that we know are wrong.

So we need a word that has A, N, E but in positions that are not the ones we tried? Specifically, for A: avoid position 3; for N: avoid position 4; for E: avoid position 5.

So for A: we can try positions 1, 2, 4, 5.
For N: positions 1, 2, 3, 5.
For E: positions 1, 2, 3, 4.

We also have two more letters to include.

Let me try to form a word:

Option: ""ANVIL"" -> but it doesn't have E or N? It has A, N, V, I, L -> no E.

We need E.

Option: ""MANGE"" -> M, A, N, G, E -> but let's see positions:
M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), E(5)

Now, A is in position 2 (which is allowed, because previously it was in 3 and wrong).
N is in position 3 (allowed, because previously it was in 4 and wrong).
E is in position 5 (but we know from the first guess that E is not in position 5? So we cannot put E in position 5 again? Because the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5. So if we put E in position 5 again, it would be the same mistake.

Therefore, we must avoid putting E in position 5. Similarly, we must avoid putting A in position 3 and N in position 4.

So in ""MANGE"", E is in position 5, which is not allowed (because we know E is not in position 5). So we cannot use that.

We need a word that has E in a position other than 5.

Let me try ""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> positions: A in 2, E in 4, N in 5.

But note: we cannot put N in position 4? Actually, in the first guess N was in position 4 and it was wrong. But in this word, N is in position 5? That's allowed because we haven't tried N in position 5 before? Actually, we only know that N is not in position 4. So position 5 is new.

Similarly, E is in position 4? We know E is not in position 5, but position 4 is new for E.

A is in position 2? We know A is not in position 3, but position 2 is new.

So ""HAVEN"" has:
- A in position 2 (new)
- E in position 4 (new)
- N in position 5 (new for N? But note: we haven't tried N in position 5, but we have tried E in position 5 and it was wrong, but that doesn't affect N).

But also, we have H and V as new letters.

Is ""HAVEN"" a valid word? Yes.

But note: the word must be 5 letters and English.

Another option: ""LEANS"" -> L, E, A, N, S -> positions: E in 2, A in 3, N in 4, S in 5.

But we cannot put A in position 3 (we know it's wrong) and N in position 4 (also wrong). So that's not allowed.

Another: ""SENNA"" -> S, E, N, N, A -> but has duplicate N? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the rules don't forbid. However, we have to be cautious. Also, A is in position 5? That's allowed. But we have two N's? We don't know if the secret word has two N's? But we know N is in the word, but maybe only once? We don't know.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to keep it simple.

Another word: ""ADIEU"" -> but it doesn't have N? We need to include N because we know it's in the word.

We must include A, N, E.

So let's try to find a word that has A, N, E and two other letters (not C or R) and positions for A, N, E that are not the ones we know are wrong.

We can try:

- Position 1: A? Then we have A at start.
- Position 2: E? 
- Position 3: N? But we know A is not in 3, but N can be in 3? Yes, because we only know N is not in 4.

But we have to form a word.

Word: ""ANODE"" -> A, N, O, D, E -> positions: A(1), N(2), O(3), D(4), E(5)

But E is in position 5? We know E is not in position 5. So we cannot use that.

Word: ""ALINE"" -> A, L, I, N, E -> positions: A(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), E(5)

But N is in position 4? We know N is not in position 4. And E is in position 5? Also not allowed.

Word: ""AMEND"" -> A, M, E, N, D -> positions: A(1), M(2), E(3), N(4), D(5)

But N is in position 4? Not allowed.

Word: ""EATEN"" -> E, A, T, E, N -> duplicate E? And E in position 1? That's allowed. A in position 2? Allowed. T in 3? E in 4? But we have two E's? And N in 5? We know E is not in position 5? But here N is in 5, which is allowed? But we have E in position 1 and 4? We don't know if the word has two E's? But we only know that E is in the word (at least one). So it might have two.

But let's see: ""EATEN"" has E in position 1 and 4? And we know E is not in position 5, but we don't know about other positions. However, we are trying to avoid the known wrong positions: for E we avoid 5, for A avoid 3, for N avoid 4.

In ""EATEN"":
- E is in 1 and 4 -> both are new (we haven't tried E in 1 or 4) -> so allowed.
- A is in 2 -> new (we only tried in 3) -> allowed.
- N is in 5 -> new (we only tried in 4) -> allowed.

But we have two E's? That might be acceptable.

But we are introducing T as a new letter.

Alternatively, we can try ""NEVER"" but that has R? We cannot use R.

Another word: ""MEANT"" -> M, E, A, N, T -> positions: E in 2? A in 3? But we cannot put A in 3. So no.

Word: ""LEANT"" we already considered and it has A in 3 and N in 4, which are not allowed.

Word: ""PANEL"" -> P, A, N, E, L -> positions: A in 2? (allowed, because we only know A is not in 3), N in 3? (allowed, because we only know N is not in 4), E in 4? (allowed, because we only know E is not in 5). And L in 5.

So ""PANEL"" has:
- P (new)
- A in 2 (new position for A)
- N in 3 (new position for N)
- E in 4 (new position for E)
- L (new)

And no C or R.

This seems valid.

Another option: ""LATEN"" -> but is that a word? I think ""laten"" is not common. Let me think of common words.

""PANEL"" is a common word.

We can also consider ""SALET"" or ""TALON"", but ""TALON"" has O and N in 5? But we need E? We must include E.

We must include A, N, E.

So ""PANEL"" is a good candidate.

Another candidate: ""ANEWS"" -> not a word.

""WANED"": W, A, N, E, D -> positions: A in 2, N in 3, E in 4, D in 5. This is similar to ""PANEL"" but with W and D.

But ""WANED"" is a word.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider ""AGENT"": A, G, E, N, T -> positions: A(1), G(2), E(3), N(4), T(5)

But N is in position 4? We know N is not in position 4. So we cannot use that.

""AGENT"" is invalid because of N in 4.

""AMENT"" -> not a word.

""OAKEN"": O, A, K, E, N -> positions: A in 2, E in 4, N in 5 -> that works? A in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), N in 5 (allowed). And O and K are new.

But ""oaken"" is a word.

So we have multiple options: ""HAVEN"", ""PANEL"", ""WANED"", ""OAKEN"", etc.

We want to maximize information. We should try to include common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as S, T, L, D, etc.

In ""crane"", we tested C, R, A, N, E. So we know A, N, E are present and C, R are absent.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover more common consonants.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.

In ""PANEL"", we are testing P, L and also A, N, E in new positions.

In ""HAVEN"", we test H, V.

In ""WANED"", we test W, D.

In ""OAKEN"", we test O, K.

I think ""PANEL"" is a good choice because it tests P and L, which are common.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" but we don't have N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we cannot omit N.

We must include A, N, E.

So I think ""PANEL"" is a solid choice.

Let me confirm the positions in ""PANEL"":
- P: position 1 (new letter, new position)
- A: position 2 (we know A is in the word, but not in position 3; now we try position 2)
- N: position 3 (we know N is in the word, but not in position 4; now we try position 3)
- E: position 4 (we know E is in the word, but not in position 5; now we try position 4)
- L: position 5 (new letter)

This should be acceptable.

So I will guess ""PANEL"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: absent, R: absent, A: present but wrong position, N: present but wrong position, E: present but wrong position), the following is deduced:
- The secret word contains A, N, and E, but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively (since in ""crane"", A was in position 3, N in 4, and E in 5, and they were marked as wrong positions).
- The letters C and R are absent from the secret word entirely.
- The new guess must include A, N, and E in positions other than the ones previously tried (i.e., A not in position 3, N not in position 4, E not in position 5) and avoid using C or R.
- To maximize information, the guess should introduce new common letters (e.g., P, L) and test A, N, E in new positions.

The word ""panel"" is chosen because:
- It includes A (position 2), N (position 3), and E (position 4), all in new positions that comply with the feedback.
- It introduces two new letters: P (position 1) and L (position 5), which are common consonants not yet tested.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.

<guess>panel</guess>",panel,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C and R are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters A, N, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".

Since ""crane"" had A in the 3rd position, N in the 4th, and E in the 5th, and they are in the word but not in those positions, we must place them elsewhere.

We also know that the secret word does not contain C or R.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Does not include C or R (since they are absent)
- Includes A, N, and E (because they are present) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
- We can include two new letters to test.

We have to avoid the positions for A, N, E as in the first guess? Actually, the feedback says they are in the word but not in those positions, so in the new guess we can try them in different positions.

But note: the feedback does not prevent us from trying the same letter again in a different position? Actually, we know A, N, E are in the word, so we can try to place them in other positions to find the correct one.

We also have two more letters to guess? The word is 5 letters, so we have two more letters that we don't know.

We should choose a word that:
- Contains A, N, E (since they are in the word) but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively? Actually, we can try A in a different position, same for N and E.

But note: the feedback doesn't tell us that the same letter might appear multiple times? However, in this feedback, we don't have any duplicate letters in ""crane"", so we don't know about duplicates. But we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don't say they are unique.

But in the example, they were unique. However, we should be cautious.

Given that A, N, E are in the word, and we have two more letters to find.

We also know that the word does not have C or R.

Let's think of words that have A, N, E and two other letters that are not C or R.

We can try to put A, N, E in positions that are not 3, 4, 5? Actually, we can try any position except the ones we know are wrong? But note: we don't know the correct positions yet.

We have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for these letters? Actually, the feedback for A says it is in the word but not in position 3. Similarly, N is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

So in the new guess, we can try:
- A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5? But note: we have to form a valid word.
- Similarly for N and E.

We also have two new letters to include.

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.

But we also want to test the positions for A, N, E.

Let me try to think of a word that has A, N, E and two new consonants (since vowels are A and E, we might need more consonants).

Common letters: we can try to use S, T, L, etc.

But note: we have to avoid C and R.

Let me think of words that contain A, N, E and two other letters (not C or R).

Possible words:

- ""SAINT"": has S, A, I, N, T -> but note: we have A, N, and E? No, it doesn't have E. So not.

- ""SANE"": but that's 4 letters. We need 5.

- ""LEARN"": but L, E, A, R, N -> but R is not allowed (we know R is absent). So we cannot use R.

- ""LEANT"": L, E, A, N, T -> this has E, A, N, and T and L. And no C or R.

But note: in ""leant"", the positions are:
L (1), E (2), A (3), N (4), T (5)

But in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting A in position 3 again? That would be the same position. We know A is not in position 3, so we should avoid that.

So we cannot put A in position 3 again.

Similarly, we cannot put N in position 4 (because in ""crane"" it was in 4 and was wrong) and E in position 5 (same reason).

So in ""leant"", if we put A in 3 (which we know is wrong) and N in 4 (also wrong) and E in 2? But E in 2 is a new position.

But we cannot use the same position for A and N that we know are wrong.

So we need a word that has A, N, E but in positions that are not the ones we tried? Specifically, for A: avoid position 3; for N: avoid position 4; for E: avoid position 5.

So for A: we can try positions 1, 2, 4, 5.
For N: positions 1, 2, 3, 5.
For E: positions 1, 2, 3, 4.

We also have two more letters to include.

Let me try to form a word:

Option: ""ANVIL"" -> but it doesn't have E or N? It has A, N, V, I, L -> no E.

We need E.

Option: ""MANGE"" -> M, A, N, G, E -> but let's see positions:
M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), E(5)

Now, A is in position 2 (which is allowed, because previously it was in 3 and wrong).
N is in position 3 (allowed, because previously it was in 4 and wrong).
E is in position 5 (but we know from the first guess that E is not in position 5? So we cannot put E in position 5 again? Because the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5. So if we put E in position 5 again, it would be the same mistake.

Therefore, we must avoid putting E in position 5. Similarly, we must avoid putting A in position 3 and N in position 4.

So in ""MANGE"", E is in position 5, which is not allowed (because we know E is not in position 5). So we cannot use that.

We need a word that has E in a position other than 5.

Let me try ""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> positions: A in 2, E in 4, N in 5.

But note: we cannot put N in position 4? Actually, in the first guess N was in position 4 and it was wrong. But in this word, N is in position 5? That's allowed because we haven't tried N in position 5 before? Actually, we only know that N is not in position 4. So position 5 is new.

Similarly, E is in position 4? We know E is not in position 5, but position 4 is new for E.

A is in position 2? We know A is not in position 3, but position 2 is new.

So ""HAVEN"" has:
- A in position 2 (new)
- E in position 4 (new)
- N in position 5 (new for N? But note: we haven't tried N in position 5, but we have tried E in position 5 and it was wrong, but that doesn't affect N).

But also, we have H and V as new letters.

Is ""HAVEN"" a valid word? Yes.

But note: the word must be 5 letters and English.

Another option: ""LEANS"" -> L, E, A, N, S -> positions: E in 2, A in 3, N in 4, S in 5.

But we cannot put A in position 3 (we know it's wrong) and N in position 4 (also wrong). So that's not allowed.

Another: ""SENNA"" -> S, E, N, N, A -> but has duplicate N? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the rules don't forbid. However, we have to be cautious. Also, A is in position 5? That's allowed. But we have two N's? We don't know if the secret word has two N's? But we know N is in the word, but maybe only once? We don't know.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to keep it simple.

Another word: ""ADIEU"" -> but it doesn't have N? We need to include N because we know it's in the word.

We must include A, N, E.

So let's try to find a word that has A, N, E and two other letters (not C or R) and positions for A, N, E that are not the ones we know are wrong.

We can try:

- Position 1: A? Then we have A at start.
- Position 2: E? 
- Position 3: N? But we know A is not in 3, but N can be in 3? Yes, because we only know N is not in 4.

But we have to form a word.

Word: ""ANODE"" -> A, N, O, D, E -> positions: A(1), N(2), O(3), D(4), E(5)

But E is in position 5? We know E is not in position 5. So we cannot use that.

Word: ""ALINE"" -> A, L, I, N, E -> positions: A(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), E(5)

But N is in position 4? We know N is not in position 4. And E is in position 5? Also not allowed.

Word: ""AMEND"" -> A, M, E, N, D -> positions: A(1), M(2), E(3), N(4), D(5)

But N is in position 4? Not allowed.

Word: ""EATEN"" -> E, A, T, E, N -> duplicate E? And E in position 1? That's allowed. A in position 2? Allowed. T in 3? E in 4? But we have two E's? And N in 5? We know E is not in position 5? But here N is in 5, which is allowed? But we have E in position 1 and 4? We don't know if the word has two E's? But we only know that E is in the word (at least one). So it might have two.

But let's see: ""EATEN"" has E in position 1 and 4? And we know E is not in position 5, but we don't know about other positions. However, we are trying to avoid the known wrong positions: for E we avoid 5, for A avoid 3, for N avoid 4.

In ""EATEN"":
- E is in 1 and 4 -> both are new (we haven't tried E in 1 or 4) -> so allowed.
- A is in 2 -> new (we only tried in 3) -> allowed.
- N is in 5 -> new (we only tried in 4) -> allowed.

But we have two E's? That might be acceptable.

But we are introducing T as a new letter.

Alternatively, we can try ""NEVER"" but that has R? We cannot use R.

Another word: ""MEANT"" -> M, E, A, N, T -> positions: E in 2? A in 3? But we cannot put A in 3. So no.

Word: ""LEANT"" we already considered and it has A in 3 and N in 4, which are not allowed.

Word: ""PANEL"" -> P, A, N, E, L -> positions: A in 2? (allowed, because we only know A is not in 3), N in 3? (allowed, because we only know N is not in 4), E in 4? (allowed, because we only know E is not in 5). And L in 5.

So ""PANEL"" has:
- P (new)
- A in 2 (new position for A)
- N in 3 (new position for N)
- E in 4 (new position for E)
- L (new)

And no C or R.

This seems valid.

Another option: ""LATEN"" -> but is that a word? I think ""laten"" is not common. Let me think of common words.

""PANEL"" is a common word.

We can also consider ""SALET"" or ""TALON"", but ""TALON"" has O and N in 5? But we need E? We must include E.

We must include A, N, E.

So ""PANEL"" is a good candidate.

Another candidate: ""ANEWS"" -> not a word.

""WANED"": W, A, N, E, D -> positions: A in 2, N in 3, E in 4, D in 5. This is similar to ""PANEL"" but with W and D.

But ""WANED"" is a word.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider ""AGENT"": A, G, E, N, T -> positions: A(1), G(2), E(3), N(4), T(5)

But N is in position 4? We know N is not in position 4. So we cannot use that.

""AGENT"" is invalid because of N in 4.

""AMENT"" -> not a word.

""OAKEN"": O, A, K, E, N -> positions: A in 2, E in 4, N in 5 -> that works? A in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), N in 5 (allowed). And O and K are new.

But ""oaken"" is a word.

So we have multiple options: ""HAVEN"", ""PANEL"", ""WANED"", ""OAKEN"", etc.

We want to maximize information. We should try to include common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as S, T, L, D, etc.

In ""crane"", we tested C, R, A, N, E. So we know A, N, E are present and C, R are absent.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover more common consonants.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.

In ""PANEL"", we are testing P, L and also A, N, E in new positions.

In ""HAVEN"", we test H, V.

In ""WANED"", we test W, D.

In ""OAKEN"", we test O, K.

I think ""PANEL"" is a good choice because it tests P and L, which are common.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" but we don't have N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we cannot omit N.

We must include A, N, E.

So I think ""PANEL"" is a solid choice.

Let me confirm the positions in ""PANEL"":
- P: position 1 (new letter, new position)
- A: position 2 (we know A is in the word, but not in position 3; now we try position 2)
- N: position 3 (we know N is in the word, but not in position 4; now we try position 3)
- E: position 4 (we know E is in the word, but not in position 5; now we try position 4)
- L: position 5 (new letter)

This should be acceptable.

So I will guess ""PANEL"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: absent, R: absent, A: present but wrong position, N: present but wrong position, E: present but wrong position), the following is deduced:
- The secret word contains A, N, and E, but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively (since in ""crane"", A was in position 3, N in 4, and E in 5, and they were marked as wrong positions).
- The letters C and R are absent from the secret word entirely.
- The new guess must include A, N, and E in positions other than the ones previously tried (i.e., A not in position 3, N not in position 4, E not in position 5) and avoid using C or R.
- To maximize information, the guess should introduce new common letters (e.g., P, L) and test A, N, E in new positions.

The word ""panel"" is chosen because:
- It includes A (position 2), N (position 3), and E (position 4), all in new positions that comply with the feedback.
- It introduces two new letters: P (position 1) and L (position 5), which are common consonants not yet tested.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.",Guess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,GLEAN,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to make an initial guess.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C and R are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters A, N, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".

Since ""crane"" had A in the 3rd position, N in the 4th, and E in the 5th, and they are in the word but not in those positions, we must place them elsewhere.

We also know that the secret word does not contain C or R.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Does not include C or R (since they are absent)
- Includes A, N, and E (because they are present) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
- We can include two new letters to test.

We have to avoid the positions for A, N, E as in the first guess? Actually, the feedback says they are in the word but not in those positions, so in the new guess we can try them in different positions.

But note: the feedback does not prevent us from trying the same letter again in a different position? Actually, we know A, N, E are in the word, so we can try to place them in other positions to find the correct one.

We also have two more letters to guess? The word is 5 letters, so we have two more letters that we don't know.

We should choose a word that:
- Contains A, N, E (since they are in the word) but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively? Actually, we can try A in a different position, same for N and E.

But note: the feedback doesn't tell us that the same letter might appear multiple times? However, in this feedback, we don't have any duplicate letters in ""crane"", so we don't know about duplicates. But we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don't say they are unique.

But in the example, they were unique. However, we should be cautious.

Given that A, N, E are in the word, and we have two more letters to find.

We also know that the word does not have C or R.

Let's think of words that have A, N, E and two other letters that are not C or R.

We can try to put A, N, E in positions that are not 3, 4, 5? Actually, we can try any position except the ones we know are wrong? But note: we don't know the correct positions yet.

We have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for these letters? Actually, the feedback for A says it is in the word but not in position 3. Similarly, N is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

So in the new guess, we can try:
- A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5? But note: we have to form a valid word.
- Similarly for N and E.

We also have two new letters to include.

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.

But we also want to test the positions for A, N, E.

Let me try to think of a word that has A, N, E and two new consonants (since vowels are A and E, we might need more consonants).

Common letters: we can try to use S, T, L, etc.

But note: we have to avoid C and R.

Let me think of words that contain A, N, E and two other letters (not C or R).

Possible words:

- ""SAINT"": has S, A, I, N, T -> but note: we have A, N, and E? No, it doesn't have E. So not.

- ""SANE"": but that's 4 letters. We need 5.

- ""LEARN"": but L, E, A, R, N -> but R is not allowed (we know R is absent). So we cannot use R.

- ""LEANT"": L, E, A, N, T -> this has E, A, N, and T and L. And no C or R.

But note: in ""leant"", the positions are:
L (1), E (2), A (3), N (4), T (5)

But in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting A in position 3 again? That would be the same position. We know A is not in position 3, so we should avoid that.

So we cannot put A in position 3 again.

Similarly, we cannot put N in position 4 (because in ""crane"" it was in 4 and was wrong) and E in position 5 (same reason).

So in ""leant"", if we put A in 3 (which we know is wrong) and N in 4 (also wrong) and E in 2? But E in 2 is a new position.

But we cannot use the same position for A and N that we know are wrong.

So we need a word that has A, N, E but in positions that are not the ones we tried? Specifically, for A: avoid position 3; for N: avoid position 4; for E: avoid position 5.

So for A: we can try positions 1, 2, 4, 5.
For N: positions 1, 2, 3, 5.
For E: positions 1, 2, 3, 4.

We also have two more letters to include.

Let me try to form a word:

Option: ""ANVIL"" -> but it doesn't have E or N? It has A, N, V, I, L -> no E.

We need E.

Option: ""MANGE"" -> M, A, N, G, E -> but let's see positions:
M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), E(5)

Now, A is in position 2 (which is allowed, because previously it was in 3 and wrong).
N is in position 3 (allowed, because previously it was in 4 and wrong).
E is in position 5 (but we know from the first guess that E is not in position 5? So we cannot put E in position 5 again? Because the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5. So if we put E in position 5 again, it would be the same mistake.

Therefore, we must avoid putting E in position 5. Similarly, we must avoid putting A in position 3 and N in position 4.

So in ""MANGE"", E is in position 5, which is not allowed (because we know E is not in position 5). So we cannot use that.

We need a word that has E in a position other than 5.

Let me try ""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> positions: A in 2, E in 4, N in 5.

But note: we cannot put N in position 4? Actually, in the first guess N was in position 4 and it was wrong. But in this word, N is in position 5? That's allowed because we haven't tried N in position 5 before? Actually, we only know that N is not in position 4. So position 5 is new.

Similarly, E is in position 4? We know E is not in position 5, but position 4 is new for E.

A is in position 2? We know A is not in position 3, but position 2 is new.

So ""HAVEN"" has:
- A in position 2 (new)
- E in position 4 (new)
- N in position 5 (new for N? But note: we haven't tried N in position 5, but we have tried E in position 5 and it was wrong, but that doesn't affect N).

But also, we have H and V as new letters.

Is ""HAVEN"" a valid word? Yes.

But note: the word must be 5 letters and English.

Another option: ""LEANS"" -> L, E, A, N, S -> positions: E in 2, A in 3, N in 4, S in 5.

But we cannot put A in position 3 (we know it's wrong) and N in position 4 (also wrong). So that's not allowed.

Another: ""SENNA"" -> S, E, N, N, A -> but has duplicate N? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the rules don't forbid. However, we have to be cautious. Also, A is in position 5? That's allowed. But we have two N's? We don't know if the secret word has two N's? But we know N is in the word, but maybe only once? We don't know.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to keep it simple.

Another word: ""ADIEU"" -> but it doesn't have N? We need to include N because we know it's in the word.

We must include A, N, E.

So let's try to find a word that has A, N, E and two other letters (not C or R) and positions for A, N, E that are not the ones we know are wrong.

We can try:

- Position 1: A? Then we have A at start.
- Position 2: E? 
- Position 3: N? But we know A is not in 3, but N can be in 3? Yes, because we only know N is not in 4.

But we have to form a word.

Word: ""ANODE"" -> A, N, O, D, E -> positions: A(1), N(2), O(3), D(4), E(5)

But E is in position 5? We know E is not in position 5. So we cannot use that.

Word: ""ALINE"" -> A, L, I, N, E -> positions: A(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), E(5)

But N is in position 4? We know N is not in position 4. And E is in position 5? Also not allowed.

Word: ""AMEND"" -> A, M, E, N, D -> positions: A(1), M(2), E(3), N(4), D(5)

But N is in position 4? Not allowed.

Word: ""EATEN"" -> E, A, T, E, N -> duplicate E? And E in position 1? That's allowed. A in position 2? Allowed. T in 3? E in 4? But we have two E's? And N in 5? We know E is not in position 5? But here N is in 5, which is allowed? But we have E in position 1 and 4? We don't know if the word has two E's? But we only know that E is in the word (at least one). So it might have two.

But let's see: ""EATEN"" has E in position 1 and 4? And we know E is not in position 5, but we don't know about other positions. However, we are trying to avoid the known wrong positions: for E we avoid 5, for A avoid 3, for N avoid 4.

In ""EATEN"":
- E is in 1 and 4 -> both are new (we haven't tried E in 1 or 4) -> so allowed.
- A is in 2 -> new (we only tried in 3) -> allowed.
- N is in 5 -> new (we only tried in 4) -> allowed.

But we have two E's? That might be acceptable.

But we are introducing T as a new letter.

Alternatively, we can try ""NEVER"" but that has R? We cannot use R.

Another word: ""MEANT"" -> M, E, A, N, T -> positions: E in 2? A in 3? But we cannot put A in 3. So no.

Word: ""LEANT"" we already considered and it has A in 3 and N in 4, which are not allowed.

Word: ""PANEL"" -> P, A, N, E, L -> positions: A in 2? (allowed, because we only know A is not in 3), N in 3? (allowed, because we only know N is not in 4), E in 4? (allowed, because we only know E is not in 5). And L in 5.

So ""PANEL"" has:
- P (new)
- A in 2 (new position for A)
- N in 3 (new position for N)
- E in 4 (new position for E)
- L (new)

And no C or R.

This seems valid.

Another option: ""LATEN"" -> but is that a word? I think ""laten"" is not common. Let me think of common words.

""PANEL"" is a common word.

We can also consider ""SALET"" or ""TALON"", but ""TALON"" has O and N in 5? But we need E? We must include E.

We must include A, N, E.

So ""PANEL"" is a good candidate.

Another candidate: ""ANEWS"" -> not a word.

""WANED"": W, A, N, E, D -> positions: A in 2, N in 3, E in 4, D in 5. This is similar to ""PANEL"" but with W and D.

But ""WANED"" is a word.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider ""AGENT"": A, G, E, N, T -> positions: A(1), G(2), E(3), N(4), T(5)

But N is in position 4? We know N is not in position 4. So we cannot use that.

""AGENT"" is invalid because of N in 4.

""AMENT"" -> not a word.

""OAKEN"": O, A, K, E, N -> positions: A in 2, E in 4, N in 5 -> that works? A in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), N in 5 (allowed). And O and K are new.

But ""oaken"" is a word.

So we have multiple options: ""HAVEN"", ""PANEL"", ""WANED"", ""OAKEN"", etc.

We want to maximize information. We should try to include common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as S, T, L, D, etc.

In ""crane"", we tested C, R, A, N, E. So we know A, N, E are present and C, R are absent.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover more common consonants.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.

In ""PANEL"", we are testing P, L and also A, N, E in new positions.

In ""HAVEN"", we test H, V.

In ""WANED"", we test W, D.

In ""OAKEN"", we test O, K.

I think ""PANEL"" is a good choice because it tests P and L, which are common.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" but we don't have N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we cannot omit N.

We must include A, N, E.

So I think ""PANEL"" is a solid choice.

Let me confirm the positions in ""PANEL"":
- P: position 1 (new letter, new position)
- A: position 2 (we know A is in the word, but not in position 3; now we try position 2)
- N: position 3 (we know N is in the word, but not in position 4; now we try position 3)
- E: position 4 (we know E is in the word, but not in position 5; now we try position 4)
- L: position 5 (new letter)

This should be acceptable.

So I will guess ""PANEL"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: absent, R: absent, A: present but wrong position, N: present but wrong position, E: present but wrong position), the following is deduced:
- The secret word contains A, N, and E, but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively (since in ""crane"", A was in position 3, N in 4, and E in 5, and they were marked as wrong positions).
- The letters C and R are absent from the secret word entirely.
- The new guess must include A, N, and E in positions other than the ones previously tried (i.e., A not in position 3, N not in position 4, E not in position 5) and avoid using C or R.
- To maximize information, the guess should introduce new common letters (e.g., P, L) and test A, N, E in new positions.

The word ""panel"" is chosen because:
- It includes A (position 2), N (position 3), and E (position 4), all in new positions that comply with the feedback.
- It introduces two new letters: P (position 1) and L (position 5), which are common consonants not yet tested.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.

The word is 5 letters, so we have two more letters that we don\'t know.\n\nWe should choose a word that:\n- Contains A, N, E (since they are in the word) but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively? Actually, we can try A in a different position, same for N and E.\n\nBut note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us that the same letter might appear multiple times? However, in this feedback, we don\'t have any duplicate letters in ""crane"", so we don\'t know about duplicates. But we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don\'t say they are unique.\n\nBut in the example, they were unique. However, we should be cautious.\n\nGiven that A, N, E are in the word, and we have two more letters to find.\n\nWe also know that the word does not have C or R.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have A, N, E and two other letters that are not C or R.\n\nWe can try to put A, N, E in positions that are not 3, 4, 5? Actually, we can try any position except the ones we know are wrong? But note: we don\'t know the correct positions yet.\n\nWe have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for these letters? Actually, the feedback for A says it is in the word but not in position 3. Similarly, N is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.\n\nSo in the new guess, we can try:\n- A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5? But note: we have to form a valid word.\n- Similarly for N and E.\n\nWe also have two new letters to include.\n\nWe should try to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.\n\nBut we also want to test the positions for A, N, E.\n\nLet me try to think of a word that has A, N, E and two new consonants (since vowels are A and E, we might need more consonants).\n\nCommon letters: we can try to use S, T, L, etc.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid C and R.\n\nLet me think of words that contain A, N, E and two other letters (not C or R).\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""SAINT"": has S, A, I, N, T -> but note: we have A, N, and E? No, it doesn\'t have E. So not.\n\n- ""SANE"": but that\'s 4 letters. We need 5.\n\n- ""LEARN"": but L, E, A, R, N -> but R is not allowed (we know R is absent). So we cannot use R.\n\n- ""LEANT"": L, E, A, N, T -> this has E, A, N, and T and L. And no C or R.\n\nBut note: in ""leant"", the positions are:\nL (1), E (2), A (3), N (4), T (5)\n\nBut in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting A in position 3 again? That would be the same position. We know A is not in position 3, so we should avoid that.\n\nSo we cannot put A in position 3 again.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot put N in position 4 (because in ""crane"" it was in 4 and was wrong) and E in position 5 (same reason).\n\nSo in ""leant"", if we put A in 3 (which we know is wrong) and N in 4 (also wrong) and E in 2? But E in 2 is a new position.\n\nBut we cannot use the same position for A and N that we know are wrong.\n\nSo we need a word that has A, N, E but in positions that are not the ones we tried? Specifically, for A: avoid position 3; for N: avoid position 4; for E: avoid position 5.\n\nSo for A: we can try positions 1, 2, 4, 5.\nFor N: positions 1, 2, 3, 5.\nFor E: positions 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nWe also have two more letters to include.\n\nLet me try to form a word:\n\nOption: ""ANVIL"" -> but it doesn\'t have E or N? It has A, N, V, I, L -> no E.\n\nWe need E.\n\nOption: ""MANGE"" -> M, A, N, G, E -> but let\'s see positions:\nM(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), E(5)\n\nNow, A is in position 2 (which is allowed, because previously it was in 3 and wrong).\nN is in position 3 (allowed, because previously it was in 4 and wrong).\nE is in position 5 (but we know from the first guess that E is not in position 5? So we cannot put E in position 5 again? Because the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5. So if we put E in position 5 again, it would be the same mistake.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid putting E in position 5. Similarly, we must avoid putting A in position 3 and N in position 4.\n\nSo in ""MANGE"", E is in position 5, which is not allowed (because we know E is not in position 5). So we cannot use that.\n\nWe need a word that has E in a position other than 5.\n\nLet me try ""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> positions: A in 2, E in 4, N in 5.\n\nBut note: we cannot put N in position 4? Actually, in the first guess N was in position 4 and it was wrong. But in this word, N is in position 5? That\'s allowed because we haven\'t tried N in position 5 before? Actually, we only know that N is not in position 4. So position 5 is new.\n\nSimilarly, E is in position 4? We know E is not in position 5, but position 4 is new for E.\n\nA is in position 2? We know A is not in position 3, but position 2 is new.\n\nSo ""HAVEN"" has:\n- A in position 2 (new)\n- E in position 4 (new)\n- N in position 5 (new for N? But note: we haven\'t tried N in position 5, but we have tried E in position 5 and it was wrong, but that doesn\'t affect N).\n\nBut also, we have H and V as new letters.\n\nIs ""HAVEN"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nBut note: the word must be 5 letters and English.\n\nAnother option: ""LEANS"" -> L, E, A, N, S -> positions: E in 2, A in 3, N in 4, S in 5.\n\nBut we cannot put A in position 3 (we know it\'s wrong) and N in position 4 (also wrong). So that\'s not allowed.\n\nAnother: ""SENNA"" -> S, E, N, N, A -> but has duplicate N? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But the rules don\'t forbid. However, we have to be cautious. Also, A is in position 5? That\'s allowed. But we have two N\'s? We don\'t know if the secret word has two N\'s? But we know N is in the word, but maybe only once? We don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates for now to keep it simple.\n\nAnother word: ""ADIEU"" -> but it doesn\'t have N? We need to include N because we know it\'s in the word.\n\nWe must include A, N, E.\n\nSo let\'s try to find a word that has A, N, E and two other letters (not C or R) and positions for A, N, E that are not the ones we know are wrong.\n\nWe can try:\n\n- Position 1: A? Then we have A at start.\n- Position 2: E? \n- Position 3: N? But we know A is not in 3, but N can be in 3? Yes, because we only know N is not in 4.\n\nBut we have to form a word.\n\nWord: ""ANODE"" -> A, N, O, D, E -> positions: A(1), N(2), O(3), D(4), E(5)\n\nBut E is in position 5? We know E is not in position 5. So we cannot use that.\n\nWord: ""ALINE"" -> A, L, I, N, E -> positions: A(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), E(5)\n\nBut N is in position 4? We know N is not in position 4. And E is in position 5? Also not allowed.\n\nWord: ""AMEND"" -> A, M, E, N, D -> positions: A(1), M(2), E(3), N(4), D(5)\n\nBut N is in position 4? Not allowed.\n\nWord: ""EATEN"" -> E, A, T, E, N -> duplicate E? And E in position 1? That\'s allowed. A in position 2? Allowed. T in 3? E in 4? But we have two E\'s? And N in 5? We know E is not in position 5? But here N is in 5, which is allowed? But we have E in position 1 and 4? We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? But we only know that E is in the word (at least one). So it might have two.\n\nBut let\'s see: ""EATEN"" has E in position 1 and 4? And we know E is not in position 5, but we don\'t know about other positions. However, we are trying to avoid the known wrong positions: for E we avoid 5, for A avoid 3, for N avoid 4.\n\nIn ""EATEN"":\n- E is in 1 and 4 -> both are new (we haven\'t tried E in 1 or 4) -> so allowed.\n- A is in 2 -> new (we only tried in 3) -> allowed.\n- N is in 5 -> new (we only tried in 4) -> allowed.\n\nBut we have two E\'s? That might be acceptable.\n\nBut we are introducing T as a new letter.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""NEVER"" but that has R? We cannot use R.\n\nAnother word: ""MEANT"" -> M, E, A, N, T -> positions: E in 2? A in 3? But we cannot put A in 3. So no.\n\nWord: ""LEANT"" we already considered and it has A in 3 and N in 4, which are not allowed.\n\nWord: ""PANEL"" -> P, A, N, E, L -> positions: A in 2? (allowed, because we only know A is not in 3), N in 3? (allowed, because we only know N is not in 4), E in 4? (allowed, because we only know E is not in 5). And L in 5.\n\nSo ""PANEL"" has:\n- P (new)\n- A in 2 (new position for A)\n- N in 3 (new position for N)\n- E in 4 (new position for E)\n- L (new)\n\nAnd no C or R.\n\nThis seems valid.\n\nAnother option: ""LATEN"" -> but is that a word? I think ""laten"" is not common. Let me think of common words.\n\n""PANEL"" is a common word.\n\nWe can also consider ""SALET"" or ""TALON"", but ""TALON"" has O and N in 5? But we need E? We must include E.\n\nWe must include A, N, E.\n\nSo ""PANEL"" is a good candidate.\n\nAnother candidate: ""ANEWS"" -> not a word.\n\n""WANED"": W, A, N, E, D -> positions: A in 2, N in 3, E in 4, D in 5. This is similar to ""PANEL"" but with W and D.\n\nBut ""WANED"" is a word.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe can also consider ""AGENT"": A, G, E, N, T -> positions: A(1), G(2), E(3), N(4), T(5)\n\nBut N is in position 4? We know N is not in position 4. So we cannot use that.\n\n""AGENT"" is invalid because of N in 4.\n\n""AMENT"" -> not a word.\n\n""OAKEN"": O, A, K, E, N -> positions: A in 2, E in 4, N in 5 -> that works? A in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), N in 5 (allowed). And O and K are new.\n\nBut ""oaken"" is a word.\n\nSo we have multiple options: ""HAVEN"", ""PANEL"", ""WANED"", ""OAKEN"", etc.\n\nWe want to maximize information. We should try to include common letters that we haven\'t tested yet, such as S, T, L, D, etc.\n\nIn ""crane"", we tested C, R, A, N, E. So we know A, N, E are present and C, R are absent.\n\nWe haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe should try to cover more common consonants.\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.\n\nIn ""PANEL"", we are testing P, L and also A, N, E in new positions.\n\nIn ""HAVEN"", we test H, V.\n\nIn ""WANED"", we test W, D.\n\nIn ""OAKEN"", we test O, K.\n\nI think ""PANEL"" is a good choice because it tests P and L, which are common.\n\nAlternatively, ""SLATE"" but we don\'t have N? We must include N because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot omit N.\n\nWe must include A, N, E.\n\nSo I think ""PANEL"" is a solid choice.\n\nLet me confirm the positions in ""PANEL"":\n- P: position 1 (new letter, new position)\n- A: position 2 (we know A is in the word, but not in position 3; now we try position 2)\n- N: position 3 (we know N is in the word, but not in position 4; now we try position 3)\n- E: position 4 (we know E is in the word, but not in position 5; now we try position 4)\n- L: position 5 (new letter)\n\nThis should be acceptable.\n\nSo I will guess ""PANEL"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: absent, R: absent, A: present but wrong position, N: present but wrong position, E: present but wrong position), the following is deduced:\n- The secret word contains A, N, and E, but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively (since in ""crane"", A was in position 3, N in 4, and E in 5, and they were marked as wrong positions).\n- The letters C and R are absent from the secret word entirely.\n- The new guess must include A, N, and E in positions other than the ones previously tried (i.e., A not in position 3, N not in position 4, E not in position 5) and avoid using C or R.\n- To maximize information, the guess should introduce new common letters (e.g., P, L) and test A, N, E in new positions.\n\nThe word ""panel"" is chosen because:\n- It includes A (position 2), N (position 3), and E (position 4), all in new positions that comply with the feedback.\n- It introduces two new letters: P (position 1) and L (position 5), which are common consonants not yet tested.\n- It is a valid 5-letter English word.\n\n<guess>panel</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
  Meaning:
    C: absent
    R: absent
    A: present but wrong position (and since it was in position 3, the correct position isn't 3)
    N: present but wrong position (position 4 is wrong)
    E: present but wrong position (position 5 is wrong)

Guess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(-)
  Meaning:
    P: absent
    A: present but wrong position (in panel, A was in position 2 -> so position 2 is not correct for A)
    N: present but wrong position (in panel, N was in position 3 -> so position 3 is not correct for N)
    E: present but wrong position (in panel, E was in position 4 -> so position 4 is not correct for E)
    L: present but wrong position (in panel, L was in position 5 -> so position 5 is not correct for L)

Now, we know the secret word:
- Contains A, N, E, L (because they are marked present in both guesses) and does not contain C, R, P.
- We have two new pieces of information: 
  - L is present (from guess 2), and it's not in position 5.

Also, from the positions:
For A: wrong in position 3 (from guess 1) and wrong in position 2 (from guess 2). So A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
Similarly:
  For N: wrong in position 4 (guess 1) and wrong in position 3 (guess 2). So N cannot be in positions 3 or 4.
  For E: wrong in position 5 (guess 1) and wrong in position 4 (guess 2). So E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
  For L: wrong in position 5 (guess 2). We have only tried L in position 5, so it cannot be in 5, but could be in 1,2,3,4.

Moreover, since the word has 5 letters and we know A, N, E, L must be in it, that accounts for 4 letters. The fifth letter is unknown (but not C, R, or P).

Possible positions for A: positions 1, 4, 5? But note: we haven't tried position 1 or 4 for A? Actually, we tried A in 3 and 2, so positions 1,4,5 are still possible? But wait, the word must have A and it must be in one of the positions we haven't tried? But we have tried position 2 and 3. So only 1,4,5? But in a 5-letter word, positions are 1 to 5.

Similarly, for N: we tried in 4 (guess1) and 3 (guess2). So N cannot be in 3 or 4 -> available positions 1,2,5.
For E: tried in 5 (guess1) and 4 (guess2) -> cannot be in 4 or 5 -> available positions 1,2,3.
For L: tried only in 5 -> cannot be in 5 -> available positions 1,2,3,4.

Now, we need to assign the letters A, N, E, L to positions 1 to 5 without using the forbidden positions for each, and we have one more letter to assign to the remaining position.

We also know that the fifth letter must be a letter not yet tried (or that hasn't been ruled out) and not C, R, P.

But note: we have only 4 letters: A, N, E, L. The word has 5 letters, so there must be a fifth letter. We don't know it yet.

The secret word has exactly 5 letters. We know it contains A, N, E, L and one more letter.

We must include a fifth letter that hasn't been guessed? We have tested only C, R, P (absent) and A, N, E, L (present). So the fifth letter could be any other letter of the alphabet.

We need to form a word that fits these constraints.

Let me try to list possible positions for each:

- A: must be in 1,4,5 (since not 2 or 3)
- N: must be in 1,2,5 (since not 3 or 4)
- E: must be in 1,2,3 (since not 4 or 5)
- L: must be in 1,2,3,4 (since not 5)

We also have a fifth letter (say X) that goes in the remaining position.

We must assign one letter per position.

Also, note that a letter cannot be in two positions at once? Except if duplicates? But we haven't been told that there are duplicates, but we must consider? The feedback doesn't show duplicates? Actually, in feedback, each letter is marked separately, so if a letter appears twice, both would be marked? But we don't have any duplicates in the guesses so far, so we can't assume duplicates.

We'll assume no duplicates for now?

But let's see: we have 5 positions and 5 distinct letters: A, N, E, L, and X.

We need to assign A, N, E, L to 4 positions and X to the fifth.

But we cannot assign two letters to one position.

So we must allocate the positions without overlap.

Moreover, the fifth letter X must be in a position that is available? Actually, we don't restrict X? X can be in any position? But we have to form a word.

Let's try to see if we can find a word that fits.

First, note that E must be in 1,2, or 3.

A must be in 1,4, or 5.

But if A is in 1, then position 1 is taken by A, so E cannot be in 1? So they might conflict.

Similarly, N must be in 1,2,5.

L must be in 1,2,3,4.

We have five positions, we need to assign letters to each.

We can consider the possibilities for position 1.

Position 1: could be A, N, E, L, or X? But let's see:

Since E cannot be in 4 or 5, position 1 is available for E? Yes.

Similarly, A, N, L can be in position 1.

But let's list the possible assignments for the known letters:

We can try to assign A, N, E, L to four positions and leave one for X.

But we don't know X.

Alternatively, we can try to find a word that includes A, N, E, L and one more letter, with the position constraints.

Let me think of common English words containing A, N, E, L.

Possible words: ""LANE"" but it's 4 letters. Need 5.

Adding a letter: ""LEARN"" but R is absent? Can't use R.

""LEANT"" -> has T, but we tried L in position 5? Wait, no: ""LEANT"" is L,E,A,N,T.

But in our position constraints:

L: ? we haven't assigned, but in ""LEANT"", L is in position 1 -> allowed (we only know L not in 5).
E is in position 2 -> allowed (E must be in 1,2,3).
A is in position 3? But we know A cannot be in position 3. So A is in 3? Forbidden. So not.

""ALIEN"" -> A,L,I,E,N.

Positions:
A in 1? -> allowed (since we haven't tried A in 1? Yes, and it's not forbidden).
L in 2? -> allowed (we only know L not in 5; 2 is okay).
I in 3? -> new letter.
E in 4? -> but E cannot be in 4! Because from feedback E is not allowed in position 4 (from guess2). So E in 4 is forbidden.

So ""ALIEN"": E in 4 -> forbidden.

""ALONE"" -> but O, and E in 4? Not allowed.

""ANILE"" -> A,N,I,L,E -> positions: A(1), N(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). But E in 5? Forbidden! Because E cannot be in 5.

""ELAND"" -> E,L,A,N,D.

Position 1: E? -> E in 1? Allowed? Yes, because E can be in 1,2,3.
Then L in 2? -> allowed.
A in 3? -> forbidden! A cannot be in 3.
So no.

We have to avoid A in positions 2 and 3? So only 1,4,5?

And E in 1,2,3? So if A is in position 1, then E cannot be in position 1? So A and E can't both be in position 1? So if A is in 1, then E must be in 2 or 3.

Similarly, N in 1,2,5? If A is in 1, then N can be in 2 or 5.

L in any but 5.

Let's try:

Option: A in position 1:
  Then:
    Position 1: A
    Then E must be in 2 or 3.
    N must be in 2 or 5? But position 2: if E is there, then N in 5? And L in 3 or 4? And the fifth letter in the other position.

  Example word? ""ANLE?"" No.

  Let me try: If A in 1, E in 2: then positions 1-A, 2-E.
    Then position 2 is E -> no problem?
    Then we need N and L and one more letter.

    Then position 3: must be L or N? But N cannot be in position 3? Only 1,2,5? But 1 is taken, 2 taken, so N must be in 5? So N in 5? Then L can be in 3 or 4? And position 4 and 3: one for L and one for the fifth letter.

    For example, word: ""A E _ _ N"" -> say ""A E L X N"" but then E is in 2? Then L in 3? Then X in 4? Then N in 5? But L in 3? Allowed? And N in 5? Also allowed? We haven't tried N in 5? But we know N can be in 5? Yes.

    E in 2: allowed? Yes, because E rejected only from 4 and 5? So 2 is okay.

    What words of the form A E L ? N: ""ae_L_N""? Not a word? ""AELXN"" doesn't work.

    With A in 1, E in 2, N in 5: then we need L and X in positions 3 and 4.

    Words: ""AXELN""? Not a word.

    Is ""AGLEN"" a word? No.

    Perhaps ""AVEL N""? Not 5 letters.

    Or ""A E X L N"" -> I can think of ""EXAM"" but not.

Another possibility: A in 1, E in 3? Then:
  Positions: 1-A, 3-E
  E in 3: allowed? Yes, because E can be in 1,2,3? So 3 is okay.
  Then N must be in 2 or 5? Because positions available: 2,4,5? But N can be in 1,2,5? But 1 taken? So 2 or 5.
  L can be in 2,4? But 2 might be taken? Also, position 4 and 5? And the fifth letter.

Case: N in position 2? Then we have A(1), N(2), E(3), then positions 4 and 5: L and fifth letter? But L cannot be in 5? So L must be in 4? And fifth letter in 5? Then the word is ""A N E L X"" -> ""ANELX""? Not a word.

Case: N in position 5? Then we have A(1), ?, E(3), ?, N(5). So positions 2 and 4: for L and X? L can be in 4? Then X in 2? Or L in 2? So word: ""A X E L N"" -> ""AXELN"" not a word? Or ""A L E X N"" -> ""ALEXN"" not a word? ""ALIEN"" we tried already? But E is in 3? And if we put L in 2, X in 4? ""ALEXN"" is not a word? Or ""ALEFN"" no. 

Alternatively, we can try A in position 4 or 5.

Try A in position 4?
Then: 
  A in 4: that is allowed? Because we know A not in 2 or 3? So position 4 is new.
  Now, we need to assign E, N, L.
  E must be in 1,2,3? 
  N must be in 1,2,5?
  L must be in 1,2,3,4? But 4 is taken by A? So L in 1,2,3?

  So for E: 1,2,3? 
  Let me put E in position 1? Then we have position 1: E? Allowed? Yes.
  Then N in 2 or 5? 
  L in 3? Or 2? 
  And fifth letter in the other.

  Example: E in 1, then N in 2? Then L in 3? Then A in 4? Then position 5: fifth letter? So word: ""E N L A X"" -> ""ENLAX"" not a word? Or ""E N L A ?"" 

  Or put E in 1, then N in 5? Then word: E ? ? A N? Then we need L? In positions 2 or 3? And X in the other? So ""E X1 X2 A N"" -> and L must be in 2 or 3? So for example: ""E L ? A N""? But we need a letter in position 3? ""EL*AN"" -> like ""ELPAN"" but P is out? Or ""ELVAN"" ? ""ELVAN"" is not a word? Or ""ELDAN""? Not English.

  ""OLEAN"" but O is a letter? And we have A in 4? But O in 1? But we have E in 1? Not.

Try E in 2? Then position 2: E? A in position 4? Then N in 1 or 5? L in 3? Or what? Position 1? Must be filled by N or L? Etc.

It's getting messy. Let me try A in position 5?
Then we have A at the end? And we know A cannot be in 2 or 3? So position 5 is new? And A can be there? From the constraints? Yes.
Then:
  Position 5: A.
  Then E must be in 1,2,3? 
  N in 1,2,5? But 5 taken? So N in 1 or 2?
  L in 1,2,3,4? But 4 available?
  Fifth letter in some position.

So example: N in 1? Then E in 2 or 3? 
Then L in 3 or 4? 
Fifth letter in the remaining position.

Word: ""N E ? ? A""? Or ""N E L ? A""? 

For example: ""N E L X A"" -> ""NELXA""? No? Or ""NELLA"" but has double L? And A is in position 5? ""NELLA"" is a proper name? Or not a common word.

Another one: ""BALED"" -> but we tried? B is new? ""BALED"": B,A,L,E,D -> A in 2? But A cannot be in position 2? Because in guess2 we tried A in position 2 and it was wrong position? So A must not be in 2.

So if we put A in 5, we avoid position 2 and 3? So okay.

What are common words with A at the end? 

Like ""ULTRA"" but U,L,T,R,A -> R is absent? Cannot use R.

""MANGA"" -> M,A,N,G,A -> duplicate A? And A in positions 2 and 5? But A in 2 is forbidden? We know A must not be in 2? So ""MANGA"" has A in 2? Not allowed.

""ARENA"" -> A in 1? But also in 4? A in 1 is allowed, but we have R which is absent? And A in 1: then E in the word? Etc. Not allowed.

Back to the constraints: include A, N, E, L and one more, with positions:

Maybe we should try a word where L is in position 1? Then A in 4 or 5? Etc.

But let me list all the forbidden positions we know:

- A: cannot be in 2 or 3
- N: cannot in 3 or 4
- E: cannot in 4 or 5
- L: cannot in 5

Available positions by letter:
A: 1,4,5
N: 1,2,5
E: 1,2,3
L: 1,2,3,4

And we have to assign these letters to exactly one position each? Because no duplicates? And then assign X to the last.

But we have 5 positions and 5 letters.

So we must have one position for each: A, N, E, L, and X.

Let me try to make a position assignment.

Try position 1: which letter can go? E? Then:
  Position 1: E (allowed)
  Then for position 2: who can go? A, N, L (because E is taken)
    Try A: not allowed in 2? So no.
    Try N: allowed? Yes, because N can be in 1,2,5? But 1 taken? So 2 allowed? Yes.
      Then position 2: N. 
      Then position 3: who? A, L (E taken, N taken) -> A cannot be in 3? So only L. L in position 3? Allowed? Yes.
        Then positions 4 and 5: for A and X? But A must be in 4 or 5? 
        Also, position 4: if A is there, then position 4: A? Allowed? Yes.
        Then position 5: X? But E cannot be in 5? That's for E? But this is X? So okay. But L cannot be in 5? But we have L in 3? Safe.

        And X in 5? but we don't know what letter. So the word: E, N, L, A, X? Positions 1: E, 2: N, 3: L, 4: A, 5: X.

        This fits: ""E N L A X"" -> but not a word? We can try to find an English word ending like this? Sounds like ""EN X A"" not.

        Or if we swap: position 4: X, position 5: A? Then word: ""E N L X A"" -> ""X"" in 4, ""A"" in 5. But what words are like that? ""ENOBA"" or something? Not common.

    After position 2 being N, for position 3, if we don't put L, then only X? But then where to put L? We haven't assigned L? Then L must be in position 4? Because it cannot be in 5? So ""E, N, X, L, A""? Word: ""ENXLA""? Not a word.

Try position 1: L? 
  Then:
    Position 1: L (allowed)
    Then position 2: available for A, N, E? 
      A: cannot in 2? So no.
      N: allowed in 2? Yes.
        Then position 2: N.
        Then position 3: available for E (since A cannot be in 3, but E can be in 3) -> so E in 3? Allowed? Yes.
          Then positions 4 and 5: for A and X? But A must be in 4 or 5? 
          Position 4: A? Allowed? Yes.
          Position 5: X? Allowed? But L cannot be in 5, but this is X? So okay.

          Word: L, N, E, A, X? or ""L,N,E,X,A"" -> positions 1:L, 2:N, 3:E, 4:A, 5:X -> word ""LNEAX""? Not a word.

          Or position 4: X? position 5: A? -> ""L,N,E,X,A"" -> ""LNEXA"" not a word.

      Or for position 2: if we put E? Allowed? Yes, position 2: E? Then:
        Then position 2: E.
        Then position 3: Cannot be A? So only N or L or X? But N cannot be in 3? So L or X? Try L: position 3: L? Not forbidden? L in 3 is allowed.
          Then position 4 and 5: for A and X? A must be in 4 or 5? 
          If A in 4? A in position 4: allowed? Yes.
          Position 5: X? Then word: ""L, E, L, A, X"" duplicate L? And ""LELAX"" not a word? And we have duplicate L? Maybe not.

          Position 4: X; position 5: A? ""L,E,L,X,A""? ""LELXA"" not a word.

        If position 3: X? then in position 4 and 5: for A and N? Because N must be in 5? (since position 4 cannot for N? and position 5 is available? N can be in 5? Then: position 4 could be A? in 4: allowed? And position 5: N? allowed? So word: ""L, E, X, A, N"" -> ""LEXAN""? Is that a word?

        ""LEXAN"" is not a common English word? Maybe not.

Now, try position 1: N? 
  Allow N in 1.
  Then position 2: can be E? (since A cannot, and N taken) -> E in 2? allowed? Yes.
    Then position 2: E.
    Then position 3: can be L? (A cannot, E and N taken) -> L in 3? allowed? Then:
        Positions 4 and 5: for A and X? 
        A cannot be in 2 or 3, so could be 4 or 5? 
        If A in 4? Then X in 5: word as ""N E L A X"" -> NELAX not word.
        If A in 5? Then X in 4: ""N E L X A""-> NELXA not word.

    Or position 3: X? then positions 4 and 5: for A and L? But L must be assigned? L cannot be in 5? So L must be in 4? then A in 5? -> ""N E X L A"" -> NEXLA not word? 

We are struggling to find a word. Maybe there's a duplicate letter.

Or perhaps we missed a common word.

Another idea: fifth letter might be 'S'? of 'T'? etc.

Let me recall that in panel, we got feedback that A, N, E, L are present! So the word at this point must have exactly A, N, E, L and one more letter.

Common words: ""ELAND"" -> E, L, A, N, D -> E in 1, L in 2, A in 3? But A in 3 is forbidden.

""ANLEP""? Not a word.

""LANES"" -> L, A, N, E, S -> But A in position 2? forbidden? Because in panel we had A in 2 and it was wrong position? So A cannot be in 2.

""LEASE"" -> L, E, A, S, E -> duplicate E? And A in 3? forbidden.

""CANEL"" -> C is out? Not.

""ANGEL"" -> A, N, G, E, L.
Positions: A in 1? Allowed.
 N in 2? Allowed.
 G in 3? new letter.
 E in 4? for bidden! Because E cannot be in 4.

""AN CLE"" not.

""NUTELLA"" too long.

""FLANE"" not 5.

""ELAN plus one letter?

Perhaps the fifth letter is 'D': ""ELAND"" again, but issues.

""ENDED""-> dup E? but we know E is present, so possibly dup? But let's see.

 But in ""ENDED"", positions: E(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), D(5). But E in 1: allowed. N in 2: allowed. E in 4? forbidden! Cannot.

""LANDE"" -> L, A, N, D, E -> A in 2? forbidden.

"" DEAN"" 4 letters.

""STAND"" not L.

 Another word: ""SAL	 ET"" not.

 I recall that we haven't tried the fifth letter much. We should guess a word that has A, N, E, L in positions meeting the constraints, and a new letter.

Let me try ""ANEAR"" but R is out.

""ANELE"" -> A, N, E, L, E? duplicate E? And positions: A in 1, N in 2, E in 3, L in 4, E in 5? That's only 4 unique letters, but duplicate E.

But with duplicate E: still,positions? A in 1? Allowed. N in 2? Allowed. E in 3? Allowed. L in 4? Allowed. E in 5? Forbidden! Because E cannot be in 5. So one E in 3 is allowed, but the other in 5? Not. So not.

 Perhaps.

 Maybe ""ALANE"" . ""ALANE"" is a word? and positions: A(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), E(5) -> A in 1 allowed, L in 2 allowed? But A in 3? forbidden! And E in 5 forbidden.

Alternatively, how about E in 1, W in 2, A in 4, L in 3, N in 5? but does that form a word? ""E W A L N"" -> ""EWALN"" not a word? or ""EWANL"" no.

Perhaps ""WELง"" not.

 I think we need to search systematically.

Let's go for A in position 4? and E in position 1? which we tried before.

With E in 1, A in 4, then N in 5? and L in 2 or 3? 
If L in 2: then position 3: X? -> word: ""E L X A N"" -> ""ELXAN"" not word.
If L in 3: ""E X L A N"" -> ""EXLAN"" not word.

Or with A in 5? and E in 1, then N in 1 or 2? position 1 occupied by E? So N in 2? Then position 3: X? position 4: L? then ""E N X L A"" , so ""ENXLA"" not word.

 or position 3: L? position 4: X? ""E N L X A"" - ""EN LX A"" not.

But ""ENOLA"" is a word? ""ENOLA"": E,N,O,L,A -> positions: E(1), N(2), O(3), L(4), A(5).

Let's check the constraints:
A: position 5? allowed. (since it can be in 1,4,5)
N: position 2? allowed. (since cannot be in 3 or 4, and 2 is okay)
E: position 1? allowed.
L: position 4? allowed. (since not 5)

 fifth letter O in position 3? which is new.

Also, O has not been tried? And not C,R,P.

So ""ENOLA"" is a valid English word? Enola is a name, sometimes accepted? But we need a common word.

Perhaps ""KENE L"" no.

 another word: ""MEAN L"" with M, but then ""AN M E"" etc.

""HEALD"" only 5 if we use, but not having A in 4 or 5? etc.

Actually, ""ENOLA"" might be acceptable. But let's see if there's a better choice.

Another common word: ""LATER"" but R is out.

""WALES"" -> W,A,L,E,S -> but A in 2? forbidden.

""LANES"" . A in 2? forbidden.

""LEANS"" . L(1), E(2), A(3), N(4), S(5) -> A in 3? forbidden. N in 4? forbidden. E in 2 we haven tried but in this case, A in 3 is already invalid.

 onsecond thought, we have to bite the bullet and choose a word even if it's a name. Or is there a better?

""SANEL""? not word.

""ANELE"" with E in 5.

""EL 0 A N"" with O? 'ELOAN""? ""ELOAN"" is not a word. ""E"" loan no.

What about ""Navel"" -> N,A,V,E,L -> A in 2? for forbidden! position 2? We know A cannot be in 2.

""VALEN"" -> V,A,L,E,N -> A in 2? again forbidden.

""NE A L S"" -> ""NEALS""? as in kneecap? not.

 Perhaps ""ILEAN"" not word.

Given the difficulty, maybe there's a mistake or we need to consider that the fifth letter is S.

Try ""S a e L 0"", no.

Another idea: perhaps the secret word has duplicate letters? For instance, two N's or something? But in our guesses, we haven't seen duplicate feedback, but it's possible.

For example, maybe the word is ""L E E A N"" but E in 1 and 2, and A in 4? then N in 5? etc.

Let me try: ""LEEAN"" not a word.

""AL EEN"" not.

""ENEMA"" no L.

Recall that in feedback for guess2: L was present but not in position 5? So we know L is in the word.

New strategy: we can ignore the fifth letter for a moment and focus on placing A, N, E, L in allowed positions and forming a valid wordtem.

We know:
- A not in 2,3 -> so in 1,4,5
- N not in 3,4 -> in 1,2,5
- E not in 4,5 -> in 1,2,3
- L not in 5 -> in 1,2,3,4

Choose a word that has these four letters and an additional letter, satisfying position constraints.

Use a word finder program? But we can't, so rack brains.

Common 5-letter words with A, E, L, N:

- ""LENIENT"" too long.
- ""PLANE"" -> P is out? We know P is absent.
- ""ELANE"" not.
- ""LEANT"" -> A in 3, N in 4? forbidd.
- ""N ELAL"" no.
- ""ANEL E"" no.

 I recall that ""ELAND"" is an animal. Let's re- check positions for ""ELAND"": positions 1:E, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:D. But A in 3 is forbidden, and also E in 1 is allowed, L in 2 is allowed? New? but A in 3 is not allowed. Plus, N in 4 is not allowed. So it violates.

""Д A L E N"" L in 1, A in 2 which is not allowed.

 Another word: ""A U L N E"" not.

After exhaustive search, found: Given the constraints, a word like ""KNEEL"" has two E's? then A no 'A'. Must include A.

Perhaps ""SELEN"" only 5 letters? no.

 It's taking too long.

Let's try the word ""CANE"" only 4.
 Or ""LANE"" 4.

 One word: ""OLE IN"" not.

 I think we may have to for ""ENOLA"" as a guess. It matches all constraints and is a proper name. Or ""ALONE"" only we saw earlier? Let's check ""ALONE"": positions - A(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). 

For A: position 1? allowed? Yes.
L: position 2? allowed? Yes? (not tried before? we only know L not in 5? 2 is new)
O: position 3? new.
N: position 4? forbidden! Because in first guess N was in 4 and wrong, and in second guess we for N in 3 and wrong? and position 4 for N is not allowed? from first guess: N in 4 was wrong position? so N cannot be in 4, and here it's in 4? so we cannot use.

Another word: ""ANODE"" has A in 1, N in 2, O in 3, E in 5? forbidden for E.

""ABED"" only 4.

I think for the sake of progress, let's guess ""ENOLA"". 

 Reasons:
- Meets the position constraints:
  E in 1: allowed
  N in 2: allowed
  O in 3: new letter, not tested and not forbidden.
  L in 4: allowed
  A in 5: allowed

- Contains A, N, E, L and O as fifth letter.

- O is a vowel, hasn't been tested.

- ""Enola"" is a word (proper name, but sometimes accepted in word games).

Alternatively, is there ""LEN O A"" no. 

 We have to make a guess.

So I will guess ""ENOLA"".

But note: the feedback for duplicates? But we don't have duplicates here.

So guess: ""ENOLA""

<guess>enola</guess>

But wait, let's double-check the constraints:

Secret word must contain A, N, E, L. ""ENOLA"" has E, N, O, L, A -> yes.

Positions:

E in 1? Is there any feedback that would make E in 1 forbidden? No, because we know E should be in 1,2,3.

N in 2: and we know N should not be in 3 or 4? 2 is not 3 or 4, so ok.

L in 4: and we know L should not be in 5? 4 is not 5, so ok.

A in 5: and we know A should not be in 2 or 3? 5 is not 2 or 3, so ok.

O in 3: a new letter.

So this fits all the constraints we have.

Therefore, we guess ""ENOLA"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(-)  
  - C and R are absent from the secret word.
  - A, N, and E are present but not in positions 3, 4, or 5 (respectively).

- **Guess 2: panel** → Feedback: P(x), A(-), N(-), E(-), L(-)  
  - P is absent from the secret word.
  - A, N, E, and L are present but not in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (respectively).

### Deductions:
1. The secret word **must contain A, N, E, and L** (as indicated by the ""-"" markings in both guesses), plus one unknown letter (not C, R, or P).
2. Positions rules from feedback:
   - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
   - N cannot be in positions 3 or 4.
   - E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
   - L cannot be in position 5.
3. Valid positions for each letter:
   - A: Positions 1, 4, or 5.
   - N: Positions 1, 2, or",enola,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
  Meaning:
    C: absent
    R: absent
    A: present but wrong position (and since it was in position 3, the correct position isn't 3)
    N: present but wrong position (position 4 is wrong)
    E: present but wrong position (position 5 is wrong)

Guess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(-)
  Meaning:
    P: absent
    A: present but wrong position (in panel, A was in position 2 -> so position 2 is not correct for A)
    N: present but wrong position (in panel, N was in position 3 -> so position 3 is not correct for N)
    E: present but wrong position (in panel, E was in position 4 -> so position 4 is not correct for E)
    L: present but wrong position (in panel, L was in position 5 -> so position 5 is not correct for L)

Now, we know the secret word:
- Contains A, N, E, L (because they are marked present in both guesses) and does not contain C, R, P.
- We have two new pieces of information: 
  - L is present (from guess 2), and it's not in position 5.

Also, from the positions:
For A: wrong in position 3 (from guess 1) and wrong in position 2 (from guess 2). So A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
Similarly:
  For N: wrong in position 4 (guess 1) and wrong in position 3 (guess 2). So N cannot be in positions 3 or 4.
  For E: wrong in position 5 (guess 1) and wrong in position 4 (guess 2). So E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
  For L: wrong in position 5 (guess 2). We have only tried L in position 5, so it cannot be in 5, but could be in 1,2,3,4.

Moreover, since the word has 5 letters and we know A, N, E, L must be in it, that accounts for 4 letters. The fifth letter is unknown (but not C, R, or P).

Possible positions for A: positions 1, 4, 5? But note: we haven't tried position 1 or 4 for A? Actually, we tried A in 3 and 2, so positions 1,4,5 are still possible? But wait, the word must have A and it must be in one of the positions we haven't tried? But we have tried position 2 and 3. So only 1,4,5? But in a 5-letter word, positions are 1 to 5.

Similarly, for N: we tried in 4 (guess1) and 3 (guess2). So N cannot be in 3 or 4 -> available positions 1,2,5.
For E: tried in 5 (guess1) and 4 (guess2) -> cannot be in 4 or 5 -> available positions 1,2,3.
For L: tried only in 5 -> cannot be in 5 -> available positions 1,2,3,4.

Now, we need to assign the letters A, N, E, L to positions 1 to 5 without using the forbidden positions for each, and we have one more letter to assign to the remaining position.

We also know that the fifth letter must be a letter not yet tried (or that hasn't been ruled out) and not C, R, P.

But note: we have only 4 letters: A, N, E, L. The word has 5 letters, so there must be a fifth letter. We don't know it yet.

The secret word has exactly 5 letters. We know it contains A, N, E, L and one more letter.

We must include a fifth letter that hasn't been guessed? We have tested only C, R, P (absent) and A, N, E, L (present). So the fifth letter could be any other letter of the alphabet.

We need to form a word that fits these constraints.

Let me try to list possible positions for each:

- A: must be in 1,4,5 (since not 2 or 3)
- N: must be in 1,2,5 (since not 3 or 4)
- E: must be in 1,2,3 (since not 4 or 5)
- L: must be in 1,2,3,4 (since not 5)

We also have a fifth letter (say X) that goes in the remaining position.

We must assign one letter per position.

Also, note that a letter cannot be in two positions at once? Except if duplicates? But we haven't been told that there are duplicates, but we must consider? The feedback doesn't show duplicates? Actually, in feedback, each letter is marked separately, so if a letter appears twice, both would be marked? But we don't have any duplicates in the guesses so far, so we can't assume duplicates.

We'll assume no duplicates for now?

But let's see: we have 5 positions and 5 distinct letters: A, N, E, L, and X.

We need to assign A, N, E, L to 4 positions and X to the fifth.

But we cannot assign two letters to one position.

So we must allocate the positions without overlap.

Moreover, the fifth letter X must be in a position that is available? Actually, we don't restrict X? X can be in any position? But we have to form a word.

Let's try to see if we can find a word that fits.

First, note that E must be in 1,2, or 3.

A must be in 1,4, or 5.

But if A is in 1, then position 1 is taken by A, so E cannot be in 1? So they might conflict.

Similarly, N must be in 1,2,5.

L must be in 1,2,3,4.

We have five positions, we need to assign letters to each.

We can consider the possibilities for position 1.

Position 1: could be A, N, E, L, or X? But let's see:

Since E cannot be in 4 or 5, position 1 is available for E? Yes.

Similarly, A, N, L can be in position 1.

But let's list the possible assignments for the known letters:

We can try to assign A, N, E, L to four positions and leave one for X.

But we don't know X.

Alternatively, we can try to find a word that includes A, N, E, L and one more letter, with the position constraints.

Let me think of common English words containing A, N, E, L.

Possible words: ""LANE"" but it's 4 letters. Need 5.

Adding a letter: ""LEARN"" but R is absent? Can't use R.

""LEANT"" -> has T, but we tried L in position 5? Wait, no: ""LEANT"" is L,E,A,N,T.

But in our position constraints:

L: ? we haven't assigned, but in ""LEANT"", L is in position 1 -> allowed (we only know L not in 5).
E is in position 2 -> allowed (E must be in 1,2,3).
A is in position 3? But we know A cannot be in position 3. So A is in 3? Forbidden. So not.

""ALIEN"" -> A,L,I,E,N.

Positions:
A in 1? -> allowed (since we haven't tried A in 1? Yes, and it's not forbidden).
L in 2? -> allowed (we only know L not in 5; 2 is okay).
I in 3? -> new letter.
E in 4? -> but E cannot be in 4! Because from feedback E is not allowed in position 4 (from guess2). So E in 4 is forbidden.

So ""ALIEN"": E in 4 -> forbidden.

""ALONE"" -> but O, and E in 4? Not allowed.

""ANILE"" -> A,N,I,L,E -> positions: A(1), N(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). But E in 5? Forbidden! Because E cannot be in 5.

""ELAND"" -> E,L,A,N,D.

Position 1: E? -> E in 1? Allowed? Yes, because E can be in 1,2,3.
Then L in 2? -> allowed.
A in 3? -> forbidden! A cannot be in 3.
So no.

We have to avoid A in positions 2 and 3? So only 1,4,5?

And E in 1,2,3? So if A is in position 1, then E cannot be in position 1? So A and E can't both be in position 1? So if A is in 1, then E must be in 2 or 3.

Similarly, N in 1,2,5? If A is in 1, then N can be in 2 or 5.

L in any but 5.

Let's try:

Option: A in position 1:
  Then:
    Position 1: A
    Then E must be in 2 or 3.
    N must be in 2 or 5? But position 2: if E is there, then N in 5? And L in 3 or 4? And the fifth letter in the other position.

  Example word? ""ANLE?"" No.

  Let me try: If A in 1, E in 2: then positions 1-A, 2-E.
    Then position 2 is E -> no problem?
    Then we need N and L and one more letter.

    Then position 3: must be L or N? But N cannot be in position 3? Only 1,2,5? But 1 is taken, 2 taken, so N must be in 5? So N in 5? Then L can be in 3 or 4? And position 4 and 3: one for L and one for the fifth letter.

    For example, word: ""A E _ _ N"" -> say ""A E L X N"" but then E is in 2? Then L in 3? Then X in 4? Then N in 5? But L in 3? Allowed? And N in 5? Also allowed? We haven't tried N in 5? But we know N can be in 5? Yes.

    E in 2: allowed? Yes, because E rejected only from 4 and 5? So 2 is okay.

    What words of the form A E L ? N: ""ae_L_N""? Not a word? ""AELXN"" doesn't work.

    With A in 1, E in 2, N in 5: then we need L and X in positions 3 and 4.

    Words: ""AXELN""? Not a word.

    Is ""AGLEN"" a word? No.

    Perhaps ""AVEL N""? Not 5 letters.

    Or ""A E X L N"" -> I can think of ""EXAM"" but not.

Another possibility: A in 1, E in 3? Then:
  Positions: 1-A, 3-E
  E in 3: allowed? Yes, because E can be in 1,2,3? So 3 is okay.
  Then N must be in 2 or 5? Because positions available: 2,4,5? But N can be in 1,2,5? But 1 taken? So 2 or 5.
  L can be in 2,4? But 2 might be taken? Also, position 4 and 5? And the fifth letter.

Case: N in position 2? Then we have A(1), N(2), E(3), then positions 4 and 5: L and fifth letter? But L cannot be in 5? So L must be in 4? And fifth letter in 5? Then the word is ""A N E L X"" -> ""ANELX""? Not a word.

Case: N in position 5? Then we have A(1), ?, E(3), ?, N(5). So positions 2 and 4: for L and X? L can be in 4? Then X in 2? Or L in 2? So word: ""A X E L N"" -> ""AXELN"" not a word? Or ""A L E X N"" -> ""ALEXN"" not a word? ""ALIEN"" we tried already? But E is in 3? And if we put L in 2, X in 4? ""ALEXN"" is not a word? Or ""ALEFN"" no. 

Alternatively, we can try A in position 4 or 5.

Try A in position 4?
Then: 
  A in 4: that is allowed? Because we know A not in 2 or 3? So position 4 is new.
  Now, we need to assign E, N, L.
  E must be in 1,2,3? 
  N must be in 1,2,5?
  L must be in 1,2,3,4? But 4 is taken by A? So L in 1,2,3?

  So for E: 1,2,3? 
  Let me put E in position 1? Then we have position 1: E? Allowed? Yes.
  Then N in 2 or 5? 
  L in 3? Or 2? 
  And fifth letter in the other.

  Example: E in 1, then N in 2? Then L in 3? Then A in 4? Then position 5: fifth letter? So word: ""E N L A X"" -> ""ENLAX"" not a word? Or ""E N L A ?"" 

  Or put E in 1, then N in 5? Then word: E ? ? A N? Then we need L? In positions 2 or 3? And X in the other? So ""E X1 X2 A N"" -> and L must be in 2 or 3? So for example: ""E L ? A N""? But we need a letter in position 3? ""EL*AN"" -> like ""ELPAN"" but P is out? Or ""ELVAN"" ? ""ELVAN"" is not a word? Or ""ELDAN""? Not English.

  ""OLEAN"" but O is a letter? And we have A in 4? But O in 1? But we have E in 1? Not.

Try E in 2? Then position 2: E? A in position 4? Then N in 1 or 5? L in 3? Or what? Position 1? Must be filled by N or L? Etc.

It's getting messy. Let me try A in position 5?
Then we have A at the end? And we know A cannot be in 2 or 3? So position 5 is new? And A can be there? From the constraints? Yes.
Then:
  Position 5: A.
  Then E must be in 1,2,3? 
  N in 1,2,5? But 5 taken? So N in 1 or 2?
  L in 1,2,3,4? But 4 available?
  Fifth letter in some position.

So example: N in 1? Then E in 2 or 3? 
Then L in 3 or 4? 
Fifth letter in the remaining position.

Word: ""N E ? ? A""? Or ""N E L ? A""? 

For example: ""N E L X A"" -> ""NELXA""? No? Or ""NELLA"" but has double L? And A is in position 5? ""NELLA"" is a proper name? Or not a common word.

Another one: ""BALED"" -> but we tried? B is new? ""BALED"": B,A,L,E,D -> A in 2? But A cannot be in position 2? Because in guess2 we tried A in position 2 and it was wrong position? So A must not be in 2.

So if we put A in 5, we avoid position 2 and 3? So okay.

What are common words with A at the end? 

Like ""ULTRA"" but U,L,T,R,A -> R is absent? Cannot use R.

""MANGA"" -> M,A,N,G,A -> duplicate A? And A in positions 2 and 5? But A in 2 is forbidden? We know A must not be in 2? So ""MANGA"" has A in 2? Not allowed.

""ARENA"" -> A in 1? But also in 4? A in 1 is allowed, but we have R which is absent? And A in 1: then E in the word? Etc. Not allowed.

Back to the constraints: include A, N, E, L and one more, with positions:

Maybe we should try a word where L is in position 1? Then A in 4 or 5? Etc.

But let me list all the forbidden positions we know:

- A: cannot be in 2 or 3
- N: cannot in 3 or 4
- E: cannot in 4 or 5
- L: cannot in 5

Available positions by letter:
A: 1,4,5
N: 1,2,5
E: 1,2,3
L: 1,2,3,4

And we have to assign these letters to exactly one position each? Because no duplicates? And then assign X to the last.

But we have 5 positions and 5 letters.

So we must have one position for each: A, N, E, L, and X.

Let me try to make a position assignment.

Try position 1: which letter can go? E? Then:
  Position 1: E (allowed)
  Then for position 2: who can go? A, N, L (because E is taken)
    Try A: not allowed in 2? So no.
    Try N: allowed? Yes, because N can be in 1,2,5? But 1 taken? So 2 allowed? Yes.
      Then position 2: N. 
      Then position 3: who? A, L (E taken, N taken) -> A cannot be in 3? So only L. L in position 3? Allowed? Yes.
        Then positions 4 and 5: for A and X? But A must be in 4 or 5? 
        Also, position 4: if A is there, then position 4: A? Allowed? Yes.
        Then position 5: X? But E cannot be in 5? That's for E? But this is X? So okay. But L cannot be in 5? But we have L in 3? Safe.

        And X in 5? but we don't know what letter. So the word: E, N, L, A, X? Positions 1: E, 2: N, 3: L, 4: A, 5: X.

        This fits: ""E N L A X"" -> but not a word? We can try to find an English word ending like this? Sounds like ""EN X A"" not.

        Or if we swap: position 4: X, position 5: A? Then word: ""E N L X A"" -> ""X"" in 4, ""A"" in 5. But what words are like that? ""ENOBA"" or something? Not common.

    After position 2 being N, for position 3, if we don't put L, then only X? But then where to put L? We haven't assigned L? Then L must be in position 4? Because it cannot be in 5? So ""E, N, X, L, A""? Word: ""ENXLA""? Not a word.

Try position 1: L? 
  Then:
    Position 1: L (allowed)
    Then position 2: available for A, N, E? 
      A: cannot in 2? So no.
      N: allowed in 2? Yes.
        Then position 2: N.
        Then position 3: available for E (since A cannot be in 3, but E can be in 3) -> so E in 3? Allowed? Yes.
          Then positions 4 and 5: for A and X? But A must be in 4 or 5? 
          Position 4: A? Allowed? Yes.
          Position 5: X? Allowed? But L cannot be in 5, but this is X? So okay.

          Word: L, N, E, A, X? or ""L,N,E,X,A"" -> positions 1:L, 2:N, 3:E, 4:A, 5:X -> word ""LNEAX""? Not a word.

          Or position 4: X? position 5: A? -> ""L,N,E,X,A"" -> ""LNEXA"" not a word.

      Or for position 2: if we put E? Allowed? Yes, position 2: E? Then:
        Then position 2: E.
        Then position 3: Cannot be A? So only N or L or X? But N cannot be in 3? So L or X? Try L: position 3: L? Not forbidden? L in 3 is allowed.
          Then position 4 and 5: for A and X? A must be in 4 or 5? 
          If A in 4? A in position 4: allowed? Yes.
          Position 5: X? Then word: ""L, E, L, A, X"" duplicate L? And ""LELAX"" not a word? And we have duplicate L? Maybe not.

          Position 4: X; position 5: A? ""L,E,L,X,A""? ""LELXA"" not a word.

        If position 3: X? then in position 4 and 5: for A and N? Because N must be in 5? (since position 4 cannot for N? and position 5 is available? N can be in 5? Then: position 4 could be A? in 4: allowed? And position 5: N? allowed? So word: ""L, E, X, A, N"" -> ""LEXAN""? Is that a word?

        ""LEXAN"" is not a common English word? Maybe not.

Now, try position 1: N? 
  Allow N in 1.
  Then position 2: can be E? (since A cannot, and N taken) -> E in 2? allowed? Yes.
    Then position 2: E.
    Then position 3: can be L? (A cannot, E and N taken) -> L in 3? allowed? Then:
        Positions 4 and 5: for A and X? 
        A cannot be in 2 or 3, so could be 4 or 5? 
        If A in 4? Then X in 5: word as ""N E L A X"" -> NELAX not word.
        If A in 5? Then X in 4: ""N E L X A""-> NELXA not word.

    Or position 3: X? then positions 4 and 5: for A and L? But L must be assigned? L cannot be in 5? So L must be in 4? then A in 5? -> ""N E X L A"" -> NEXLA not word? 

We are struggling to find a word. Maybe there's a duplicate letter.

Or perhaps we missed a common word.

Another idea: fifth letter might be 'S'? of 'T'? etc.

Let me recall that in panel, we got feedback that A, N, E, L are present! So the word at this point must have exactly A, N, E, L and one more letter.

Common words: ""ELAND"" -> E, L, A, N, D -> E in 1, L in 2, A in 3? But A in 3 is forbidden.

""ANLEP""? Not a word.

""LANES"" -> L, A, N, E, S -> But A in position 2? forbidden? Because in panel we had A in 2 and it was wrong position? So A cannot be in 2.

""LEASE"" -> L, E, A, S, E -> duplicate E? And A in 3? forbidden.

""CANEL"" -> C is out? Not.

""ANGEL"" -> A, N, G, E, L.
Positions: A in 1? Allowed.
 N in 2? Allowed.
 G in 3? new letter.
 E in 4? for bidden! Because E cannot be in 4.

""AN CLE"" not.

""NUTELLA"" too long.

""FLANE"" not 5.

""ELAN plus one letter?

Perhaps the fifth letter is 'D': ""ELAND"" again, but issues.

""ENDED""-> dup E? but we know E is present, so possibly dup? But let's see.

 But in ""ENDED"", positions: E(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), D(5). But E in 1: allowed. N in 2: allowed. E in 4? forbidden! Cannot.

""LANDE"" -> L, A, N, D, E -> A in 2? forbidden.

"" DEAN"" 4 letters.

""STAND"" not L.

 Another word: ""SAL	 ET"" not.

 I recall that we haven't tried the fifth letter much. We should guess a word that has A, N, E, L in positions meeting the constraints, and a new letter.

Let me try ""ANEAR"" but R is out.

""ANELE"" -> A, N, E, L, E? duplicate E? And positions: A in 1, N in 2, E in 3, L in 4, E in 5? That's only 4 unique letters, but duplicate E.

But with duplicate E: still,positions? A in 1? Allowed. N in 2? Allowed. E in 3? Allowed. L in 4? Allowed. E in 5? Forbidden! Because E cannot be in 5. So one E in 3 is allowed, but the other in 5? Not. So not.

 Perhaps.

 Maybe ""ALANE"" . ""ALANE"" is a word? and positions: A(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), E(5) -> A in 1 allowed, L in 2 allowed? But A in 3? forbidden! And E in 5 forbidden.

Alternatively, how about E in 1, W in 2, A in 4, L in 3, N in 5? but does that form a word? ""E W A L N"" -> ""EWALN"" not a word? or ""EWANL"" no.

Perhaps ""WELง"" not.

 I think we need to search systematically.

Let's go for A in position 4? and E in position 1? which we tried before.

With E in 1, A in 4, then N in 5? and L in 2 or 3? 
If L in 2: then position 3: X? -> word: ""E L X A N"" -> ""ELXAN"" not word.
If L in 3: ""E X L A N"" -> ""EXLAN"" not word.

Or with A in 5? and E in 1, then N in 1 or 2? position 1 occupied by E? So N in 2? Then position 3: X? position 4: L? then ""E N X L A"" , so ""ENXLA"" not word.

 or position 3: L? position 4: X? ""E N L X A"" - ""EN LX A"" not.

But ""ENOLA"" is a word? ""ENOLA"": E,N,O,L,A -> positions: E(1), N(2), O(3), L(4), A(5).

Let's check the constraints:
A: position 5? allowed. (since it can be in 1,4,5)
N: position 2? allowed. (since cannot be in 3 or 4, and 2 is okay)
E: position 1? allowed.
L: position 4? allowed. (since not 5)

 fifth letter O in position 3? which is new.

Also, O has not been tried? And not C,R,P.

So ""ENOLA"" is a valid English word? Enola is a name, sometimes accepted? But we need a common word.

Perhaps ""KENE L"" no.

 another word: ""MEAN L"" with M, but then ""AN M E"" etc.

""HEALD"" only 5 if we use, but not having A in 4 or 5? etc.

Actually, ""ENOLA"" might be acceptable. But let's see if there's a better choice.

Another common word: ""LATER"" but R is out.

""WALES"" -> W,A,L,E,S -> but A in 2? forbidden.

""LANES"" . A in 2? forbidden.

""LEANS"" . L(1), E(2), A(3), N(4), S(5) -> A in 3? forbidden. N in 4? forbidden. E in 2 we haven tried but in this case, A in 3 is already invalid.

 onsecond thought, we have to bite the bullet and choose a word even if it's a name. Or is there a better?

""SANEL""? not word.

""ANELE"" with E in 5.

""EL 0 A N"" with O? 'ELOAN""? ""ELOAN"" is not a word. ""E"" loan no.

What about ""Navel"" -> N,A,V,E,L -> A in 2? for forbidden! position 2? We know A cannot be in 2.

""VALEN"" -> V,A,L,E,N -> A in 2? again forbidden.

""NE A L S"" -> ""NEALS""? as in kneecap? not.

 Perhaps ""ILEAN"" not word.

Given the difficulty, maybe there's a mistake or we need to consider that the fifth letter is S.

Try ""S a e L 0"", no.

Another idea: perhaps the secret word has duplicate letters? For instance, two N's or something? But in our guesses, we haven't seen duplicate feedback, but it's possible.

For example, maybe the word is ""L E E A N"" but E in 1 and 2, and A in 4? then N in 5? etc.

Let me try: ""LEEAN"" not a word.

""AL EEN"" not.

""ENEMA"" no L.

Recall that in feedback for guess2: L was present but not in position 5? So we know L is in the word.

New strategy: we can ignore the fifth letter for a moment and focus on placing A, N, E, L in allowed positions and forming a valid wordtem.

We know:
- A not in 2,3 -> so in 1,4,5
- N not in 3,4 -> in 1,2,5
- E not in 4,5 -> in 1,2,3
- L not in 5 -> in 1,2,3,4

Choose a word that has these four letters and an additional letter, satisfying position constraints.

Use a word finder program? But we can't, so rack brains.

Common 5-letter words with A, E, L, N:

- ""LENIENT"" too long.
- ""PLANE"" -> P is out? We know P is absent.
- ""ELANE"" not.
- ""LEANT"" -> A in 3, N in 4? forbidd.
- ""N ELAL"" no.
- ""ANEL E"" no.

 I recall that ""ELAND"" is an animal. Let's re- check positions for ""ELAND"": positions 1:E, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:D. But A in 3 is forbidden, and also E in 1 is allowed, L in 2 is allowed? New? but A in 3 is not allowed. Plus, N in 4 is not allowed. So it violates.

""Д A L E N"" L in 1, A in 2 which is not allowed.

 Another word: ""A U L N E"" not.

After exhaustive search, found: Given the constraints, a word like ""KNEEL"" has two E's? then A no 'A'. Must include A.

Perhaps ""SELEN"" only 5 letters? no.

 It's taking too long.

Let's try the word ""CANE"" only 4.
 Or ""LANE"" 4.

 One word: ""OLE IN"" not.

 I think we may have to for ""ENOLA"" as a guess. It matches all constraints and is a proper name. Or ""ALONE"" only we saw earlier? Let's check ""ALONE"": positions - A(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). 

For A: position 1? allowed? Yes.
L: position 2? allowed? Yes? (not tried before? we only know L not in 5? 2 is new)
O: position 3? new.
N: position 4? forbidden! Because in first guess N was in 4 and wrong, and in second guess we for N in 3 and wrong? and position 4 for N is not allowed? from first guess: N in 4 was wrong position? so N cannot be in 4, and here it's in 4? so we cannot use.

Another word: ""ANODE"" has A in 1, N in 2, O in 3, E in 5? forbidden for E.

""ABED"" only 4.

I think for the sake of progress, let's guess ""ENOLA"". 

 Reasons:
- Meets the position constraints:
  E in 1: allowed
  N in 2: allowed
  O in 3: new letter, not tested and not forbidden.
  L in 4: allowed
  A in 5: allowed

- Contains A, N, E, L and O as fifth letter.

- O is a vowel, hasn't been tested.

- ""Enola"" is a word (proper name, but sometimes accepted in word games).

Alternatively, is there ""LEN O A"" no. 

 We have to make a guess.

So I will guess ""ENOLA"".

But note: the feedback for duplicates? But we don't have duplicates here.

So guess: ""ENOLA""

<guess>enola</guess>

But wait, let's double-check the constraints:

Secret word must contain A, N, E, L. ""ENOLA"" has E, N, O, L, A -> yes.

Positions:

E in 1? Is there any feedback that would make E in 1 forbidden? No, because we know E should be in 1,2,3.

N in 2: and we know N should not be in 3 or 4? 2 is not 3 or 4, so ok.

L in 4: and we know L should not be in 5? 4 is not 5, so ok.

A in 5: and we know A should not be in 2 or 3? 5 is not 2 or 3, so ok.

O in 3: a new letter.

So this fits all the constraints we have.

Therefore, we guess ""ENOLA"".",Guess 3: enola -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(-) O(x) L(-) A(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,GLEAN,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to make an initial guess.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C and R are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters A, N, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".

Since ""crane"" had A in the 3rd position, N in the 4th, and E in the 5th, and they are in the word but not in those positions, we must place them elsewhere.

We also know that the secret word does not contain C or R.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Does not include C or R (since they are absent)
- Includes A, N, and E (because they are present) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
- We can include two new letters to test.

We have to avoid the positions for A, N, E as in the first guess? Actually, the feedback says they are in the word but not in those positions, so in the new guess we can try them in different positions.

But note: the feedback does not prevent us from trying the same letter again in a different position? Actually, we know A, N, E are in the word, so we can try to place them in other positions to find the correct one.

We also have two more letters to guess? The word is 5 letters, so we have two more letters that we don't know.

We should choose a word that:
- Contains A, N, E (since they are in the word) but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively? Actually, we can try A in a different position, same for N and E.

But note: the feedback doesn't tell us that the same letter might appear multiple times? However, in this feedback, we don't have any duplicate letters in ""crane"", so we don't know about duplicates. But we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don't say they are unique.

But in the example, they were unique. However, we should be cautious.

Given that A, N, E are in the word, and we have two more letters to find.

We also know that the word does not have C or R.

Let's think of words that have A, N, E and two other letters that are not C or R.

We can try to put A, N, E in positions that are not 3, 4, 5? Actually, we can try any position except the ones we know are wrong? But note: we don't know the correct positions yet.

We have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for these letters? Actually, the feedback for A says it is in the word but not in position 3. Similarly, N is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

So in the new guess, we can try:
- A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5? But note: we have to form a valid word.
- Similarly for N and E.

We also have two new letters to include.

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.

But we also want to test the positions for A, N, E.

Let me try to think of a word that has A, N, E and two new consonants (since vowels are A and E, we might need more consonants).

Common letters: we can try to use S, T, L, etc.

But note: we have to avoid C and R.

Let me think of words that contain A, N, E and two other letters (not C or R).

Possible words:

- ""SAINT"": has S, A, I, N, T -> but note: we have A, N, and E? No, it doesn't have E. So not.

- ""SANE"": but that's 4 letters. We need 5.

- ""LEARN"": but L, E, A, R, N -> but R is not allowed (we know R is absent). So we cannot use R.

- ""LEANT"": L, E, A, N, T -> this has E, A, N, and T and L. And no C or R.

But note: in ""leant"", the positions are:
L (1), E (2), A (3), N (4), T (5)

But in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting A in position 3 again? That would be the same position. We know A is not in position 3, so we should avoid that.

So we cannot put A in position 3 again.

Similarly, we cannot put N in position 4 (because in ""crane"" it was in 4 and was wrong) and E in position 5 (same reason).

So in ""leant"", if we put A in 3 (which we know is wrong) and N in 4 (also wrong) and E in 2? But E in 2 is a new position.

But we cannot use the same position for A and N that we know are wrong.

So we need a word that has A, N, E but in positions that are not the ones we tried? Specifically, for A: avoid position 3; for N: avoid position 4; for E: avoid position 5.

So for A: we can try positions 1, 2, 4, 5.
For N: positions 1, 2, 3, 5.
For E: positions 1, 2, 3, 4.

We also have two more letters to include.

Let me try to form a word:

Option: ""ANVIL"" -> but it doesn't have E or N? It has A, N, V, I, L -> no E.

We need E.

Option: ""MANGE"" -> M, A, N, G, E -> but let's see positions:
M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), E(5)

Now, A is in position 2 (which is allowed, because previously it was in 3 and wrong).
N is in position 3 (allowed, because previously it was in 4 and wrong).
E is in position 5 (but we know from the first guess that E is not in position 5? So we cannot put E in position 5 again? Because the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5. So if we put E in position 5 again, it would be the same mistake.

Therefore, we must avoid putting E in position 5. Similarly, we must avoid putting A in position 3 and N in position 4.

So in ""MANGE"", E is in position 5, which is not allowed (because we know E is not in position 5). So we cannot use that.

We need a word that has E in a position other than 5.

Let me try ""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> positions: A in 2, E in 4, N in 5.

But note: we cannot put N in position 4? Actually, in the first guess N was in position 4 and it was wrong. But in this word, N is in position 5? That's allowed because we haven't tried N in position 5 before? Actually, we only know that N is not in position 4. So position 5 is new.

Similarly, E is in position 4? We know E is not in position 5, but position 4 is new for E.

A is in position 2? We know A is not in position 3, but position 2 is new.

So ""HAVEN"" has:
- A in position 2 (new)
- E in position 4 (new)
- N in position 5 (new for N? But note: we haven't tried N in position 5, but we have tried E in position 5 and it was wrong, but that doesn't affect N).

But also, we have H and V as new letters.

Is ""HAVEN"" a valid word? Yes.

But note: the word must be 5 letters and English.

Another option: ""LEANS"" -> L, E, A, N, S -> positions: E in 2, A in 3, N in 4, S in 5.

But we cannot put A in position 3 (we know it's wrong) and N in position 4 (also wrong). So that's not allowed.

Another: ""SENNA"" -> S, E, N, N, A -> but has duplicate N? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the rules don't forbid. However, we have to be cautious. Also, A is in position 5? That's allowed. But we have two N's? We don't know if the secret word has two N's? But we know N is in the word, but maybe only once? We don't know.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to keep it simple.

Another word: ""ADIEU"" -> but it doesn't have N? We need to include N because we know it's in the word.

We must include A, N, E.

So let's try to find a word that has A, N, E and two other letters (not C or R) and positions for A, N, E that are not the ones we know are wrong.

We can try:

- Position 1: A? Then we have A at start.
- Position 2: E? 
- Position 3: N? But we know A is not in 3, but N can be in 3? Yes, because we only know N is not in 4.

But we have to form a word.

Word: ""ANODE"" -> A, N, O, D, E -> positions: A(1), N(2), O(3), D(4), E(5)

But E is in position 5? We know E is not in position 5. So we cannot use that.

Word: ""ALINE"" -> A, L, I, N, E -> positions: A(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), E(5)

But N is in position 4? We know N is not in position 4. And E is in position 5? Also not allowed.

Word: ""AMEND"" -> A, M, E, N, D -> positions: A(1), M(2), E(3), N(4), D(5)

But N is in position 4? Not allowed.

Word: ""EATEN"" -> E, A, T, E, N -> duplicate E? And E in position 1? That's allowed. A in position 2? Allowed. T in 3? E in 4? But we have two E's? And N in 5? We know E is not in position 5? But here N is in 5, which is allowed? But we have E in position 1 and 4? We don't know if the word has two E's? But we only know that E is in the word (at least one). So it might have two.

But let's see: ""EATEN"" has E in position 1 and 4? And we know E is not in position 5, but we don't know about other positions. However, we are trying to avoid the known wrong positions: for E we avoid 5, for A avoid 3, for N avoid 4.

In ""EATEN"":
- E is in 1 and 4 -> both are new (we haven't tried E in 1 or 4) -> so allowed.
- A is in 2 -> new (we only tried in 3) -> allowed.
- N is in 5 -> new (we only tried in 4) -> allowed.

But we have two E's? That might be acceptable.

But we are introducing T as a new letter.

Alternatively, we can try ""NEVER"" but that has R? We cannot use R.

Another word: ""MEANT"" -> M, E, A, N, T -> positions: E in 2? A in 3? But we cannot put A in 3. So no.

Word: ""LEANT"" we already considered and it has A in 3 and N in 4, which are not allowed.

Word: ""PANEL"" -> P, A, N, E, L -> positions: A in 2? (allowed, because we only know A is not in 3), N in 3? (allowed, because we only know N is not in 4), E in 4? (allowed, because we only know E is not in 5). And L in 5.

So ""PANEL"" has:
- P (new)
- A in 2 (new position for A)
- N in 3 (new position for N)
- E in 4 (new position for E)
- L (new)

And no C or R.

This seems valid.

Another option: ""LATEN"" -> but is that a word? I think ""laten"" is not common. Let me think of common words.

""PANEL"" is a common word.

We can also consider ""SALET"" or ""TALON"", but ""TALON"" has O and N in 5? But we need E? We must include E.

We must include A, N, E.

So ""PANEL"" is a good candidate.

Another candidate: ""ANEWS"" -> not a word.

""WANED"": W, A, N, E, D -> positions: A in 2, N in 3, E in 4, D in 5. This is similar to ""PANEL"" but with W and D.

But ""WANED"" is a word.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider ""AGENT"": A, G, E, N, T -> positions: A(1), G(2), E(3), N(4), T(5)

But N is in position 4? We know N is not in position 4. So we cannot use that.

""AGENT"" is invalid because of N in 4.

""AMENT"" -> not a word.

""OAKEN"": O, A, K, E, N -> positions: A in 2, E in 4, N in 5 -> that works? A in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), N in 5 (allowed). And O and K are new.

But ""oaken"" is a word.

So we have multiple options: ""HAVEN"", ""PANEL"", ""WANED"", ""OAKEN"", etc.

We want to maximize information. We should try to include common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as S, T, L, D, etc.

In ""crane"", we tested C, R, A, N, E. So we know A, N, E are present and C, R are absent.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover more common consonants.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.

In ""PANEL"", we are testing P, L and also A, N, E in new positions.

In ""HAVEN"", we test H, V.

In ""WANED"", we test W, D.

In ""OAKEN"", we test O, K.

I think ""PANEL"" is a good choice because it tests P and L, which are common.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" but we don't have N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we cannot omit N.

We must include A, N, E.

So I think ""PANEL"" is a solid choice.

Let me confirm the positions in ""PANEL"":
- P: position 1 (new letter, new position)
- A: position 2 (we know A is in the word, but not in position 3; now we try position 2)
- N: position 3 (we know N is in the word, but not in position 4; now we try position 3)
- E: position 4 (we know E is in the word, but not in position 5; now we try position 4)
- L: position 5 (new letter)

This should be acceptable.

So I will guess ""PANEL"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: absent, R: absent, A: present but wrong position, N: present but wrong position, E: present but wrong position), the following is deduced:
- The secret word contains A, N, and E, but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively (since in ""crane"", A was in position 3, N in 4, and E in 5, and they were marked as wrong positions).
- The letters C and R are absent from the secret word entirely.
- The new guess must include A, N, and E in positions other than the ones previously tried (i.e., A not in position 3, N not in position 4, E not in position 5) and avoid using C or R.
- To maximize information, the guess should introduce new common letters (e.g., P, L) and test A, N, E in new positions.

The word ""panel"" is chosen because:
- It includes A (position 2), N (position 3), and E (position 4), all in new positions that comply with the feedback.
- It introduces two new letters: P (position 1) and L (position 5), which are common consonants not yet tested.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.

<guess>panel</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
  Meaning:
    C: absent
    R: absent
    A: present but wrong position (and since it was in position 3, the correct position isn't 3)
    N: present but wrong position (position 4 is wrong)
    E: present but wrong position (position 5 is wrong)

Guess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(-)
  Meaning:
    P: absent
    A: present but wrong position (in panel, A was in position 2 -> so position 2 is not correct for A)
    N: present but wrong position (in panel, N was in position 3 -> so position 3 is not correct for N)
    E: present but wrong position (in panel, E was in position 4 -> so position 4 is not correct for E)
    L: present but wrong position (in panel, L was in position 5 -> so position 5 is not correct for L)

Now, we know the secret word:
- Contains A, N, E, L (because they are marked present in both guesses) and does not contain C, R, P.
- We have two new pieces of information: 
  - L is present (from guess 2), and it's not in position 5.

Also, from the positions:
For A: wrong in position 3 (from guess 1) and wrong in position 2 (from guess 2). So A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
Similarly:
  For N: wrong in position 4 (guess 1) and wrong in position 3 (guess 2). So N cannot be in positions 3 or 4.
  For E: wrong in position 5 (guess 1) and wrong in position 4 (guess 2). So E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
  For L: wrong in position 5 (guess 2). We have only tried L in position 5, so it cannot be in 5, but could be in 1,2,3,4.

Moreover, since the word has 5 letters and we know A, N, E, L must be in it, that accounts for 4 letters. The fifth letter is unknown (but not C, R, or P).

Possible positions for A: positions 1, 4, 5? But note: we haven't tried position 1 or 4 for A? Actually, we tried A in 3 and 2, so positions 1,4,5 are still possible? But wait, the word must have A and it must be in one of the positions we haven't tried? But we have tried position 2 and 3. So only 1,4,5? But in a 5-letter word, positions are 1 to 5.

Similarly, for N: we tried in 4 (guess1) and 3 (guess2). So N cannot be in 3 or 4 -> available positions 1,2,5.
For E: tried in 5 (guess1) and 4 (guess2) -> cannot be in 4 or 5 -> available positions 1,2,3.
For L: tried only in 5 -> cannot be in 5 -> available positions 1,2,3,4.

Now, we need to assign the letters A, N, E, L to positions 1 to 5 without using the forbidden positions for each, and we have one more letter to assign to the remaining position.

We also know that the fifth letter must be a letter not yet tried (or that hasn't been ruled out) and not C, R, P.

But note: we have only 4 letters: A, N, E, L. The word has 5 letters, so there must be a fifth letter. We don't know it yet.

The secret word has exactly 5 letters. We know it contains A, N, E, L and one more letter.

We must include a fifth letter that hasn't been guessed? We have tested only C, R, P (absent) and A, N, E, L (present). So the fifth letter could be any other letter of the alphabet.

We need to form a word that fits these constraints.

Let me try to list possible positions for each:

- A: must be in 1,4,5 (since not 2 or 3)
- N: must be in 1,2,5 (since not 3 or 4)
- E: must be in 1,2,3 (since not 4 or 5)
- L: must be in 1,2,3,4 (since not 5)

We also have a fifth letter (say X) that goes in the remaining position.

We must assign one letter per position.

Also, note that a letter cannot be in two positions at once? Except if duplicates? But we haven't been told that there are duplicates, but we must consider? The feedback doesn't show duplicates? Actually, in feedback, each letter is marked separately, so if a letter appears twice, both would be marked? But we don't have any duplicates in the guesses so far, so we can't assume duplicates.

We'll assume no duplicates for now?

But let's see: we have 5 positions and 5 distinct letters: A, N, E, L, and X.

We need to assign A, N, E, L to 4 positions and X to the fifth.

But we cannot assign two letters to one position.

So we must allocate the positions without overlap.

Moreover, the fifth letter X must be in a position that is available? Actually, we don't restrict X? X can be in any position? But we have to form a word.

Let's try to see if we can find a word that fits.

First, note that E must be in 1,2, or 3.

A must be in 1,4, or 5.

But if A is in 1, then position 1 is taken by A, so E cannot be in 1? So they might conflict.

Similarly, N must be in 1,2,5.

L must be in 1,2,3,4.

We have five positions, we need to assign letters to each.

We can consider the possibilities for position 1.

Position 1: could be A, N, E, L, or X? But let's see:

Since E cannot be in 4 or 5, position 1 is available for E? Yes.

Similarly, A, N, L can be in position 1.

But let's list the possible assignments for the known letters:

We can try to assign A, N, E, L to four positions and leave one for X.

But we don't know X.

Alternatively, we can try to find a word that includes A, N, E, L and one more letter, with the position constraints.

Let me think of common English words containing A, N, E, L.

Possible words: ""LANE"" but it's 4 letters. Need 5.

Adding a letter: ""LEARN"" but R is absent? Can't use R.

""LEANT"" -> has T, but we tried L in position 5? Wait, no: ""LEANT"" is L,E,A,N,T.

But in our position constraints:

L: ? we haven't assigned, but in ""LEANT"", L is in position 1 -> allowed (we only know L not in 5).
E is in position 2 -> allowed (E must be in 1,2,3).
A is in position 3? But we know A cannot be in position 3. So A is in 3? Forbidden. So not.

""ALIEN"" -> A,L,I,E,N.

Positions:
A in 1? -> allowed (since we haven't tried A in 1? Yes, and it's not forbidden).
L in 2? -> allowed (we only know L not in 5; 2 is okay).
I in 3? -> new letter.
E in 4? -> but E cannot be in 4! Because from feedback E is not allowed in position 4 (from guess2). So E in 4 is forbidden.

So ""ALIEN"": E in 4 -> forbidden.

""ALONE"" -> but O, and E in 4? Not allowed.

""ANILE"" -> A,N,I,L,E -> positions: A(1), N(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). But E in 5? Forbidden! Because E cannot be in 5.

""ELAND"" -> E,L,A,N,D.

Position 1: E? -> E in 1? Allowed? Yes, because E can be in 1,2,3.
Then L in 2? -> allowed.
A in 3? -> forbidden! A cannot be in 3.
So no.

We have to avoid A in positions 2 and 3? So only 1,4,5?

And E in 1,2,3? So if A is in position 1, then E cannot be in position 1? So A and E can't both be in position 1? So if A is in 1, then E must be in 2 or 3.

Similarly, N in 1,2,5? If A is in 1, then N can be in 2 or 5.

L in any but 5.

Let's try:

Option: A in position 1:
  Then:
    Position 1: A
    Then E must be in 2 or 3.
    N must be in 2 or 5? But position 2: if E is there, then N in 5? And L in 3 or 4? And the fifth letter in the other position.

  Example word? ""ANLE?"" No.

  Let me try: If A in 1, E in 2: then positions 1-A, 2-E.
    Then position 2 is E -> no problem?
    Then we need N and L and one more letter.

    Then position 3: must be L or N? But N cannot be in position 3? Only 1,2,5? But 1 is taken, 2 taken, so N must be in 5? So N in 5? Then L can be in 3 or 4? And position 4 and 3: one for L and one for the fifth letter.

    For example, word: ""A E _ _ N"" -> say ""A E L X N"" but then E is in 2? Then L in 3? Then X in 4? Then N in 5? But L in 3? Allowed? And N in 5? Also allowed? We haven't tried N in 5? But we know N can be in 5? Yes.

    E in 2: allowed? Yes, because E rejected only from 4 and 5? So 2 is okay.

    What words of the form A E L ? N: ""ae_L_N""? Not a word? ""AELXN"" doesn't work.

    With A in 1, E in 2, N in 5: then we need L and X in positions 3 and 4.

    Words: ""AXELN""? Not a word.

    Is ""AGLEN"" a word? No.

    Perhaps ""AVEL N""? Not 5 letters.

    Or ""A E X L N"" -> I can think of ""EXAM"" but not.

Another possibility: A in 1, E in 3? Then:
  Positions: 1-A, 3-E
  E in 3: allowed? Yes, because E can be in 1,2,3? So 3 is okay.
  Then N must be in 2 or 5? Because positions available: 2,4,5? But N can be in 1,2,5? But 1 taken? So 2 or 5.
  L can be in 2,4? But 2 might be taken? Also, position 4 and 5? And the fifth letter.

Case: N in position 2? Then we have A(1), N(2), E(3), then positions 4 and 5: L and fifth letter? But L cannot be in 5? So L must be in 4? And fifth letter in 5? Then the word is ""A N E L X"" -> ""ANELX""? Not a word.

Case: N in position 5? Then we have A(1), ?, E(3), ?, N(5). So positions 2 and 4: for L and X? L can be in 4? Then X in 2? Or L in 2? So word: ""A X E L N"" -> ""AXELN"" not a word? Or ""A L E X N"" -> ""ALEXN"" not a word? ""ALIEN"" we tried already? But E is in 3? And if we put L in 2, X in 4? ""ALEXN"" is not a word? Or ""ALEFN"" no. 

Alternatively, we can try A in position 4 or 5.

Try A in position 4?
Then: 
  A in 4: that is allowed? Because we know A not in 2 or 3? So position 4 is new.
  Now, we need to assign E, N, L.
  E must be in 1,2,3? 
  N must be in 1,2,5?
  L must be in 1,2,3,4? But 4 is taken by A? So L in 1,2,3?

  So for E: 1,2,3? 
  Let me put E in position 1? Then we have position 1: E? Allowed? Yes.
  Then N in 2 or 5? 
  L in 3? Or 2? 
  And fifth letter in the other.

  Example: E in 1, then N in 2? Then L in 3? Then A in 4? Then position 5: fifth letter? So word: ""E N L A X"" -> ""ENLAX"" not a word? Or ""E N L A ?"" 

  Or put E in 1, then N in 5? Then word: E ? ? A N? Then we need L? In positions 2 or 3? And X in the other? So ""E X1 X2 A N"" -> and L must be in 2 or 3? So for example: ""E L ? A N""? But we need a letter in position 3? ""EL*AN"" -> like ""ELPAN"" but P is out? Or ""ELVAN"" ? ""ELVAN"" is not a word? Or ""ELDAN""? Not English.

  ""OLEAN"" but O is a letter? And we have A in 4? But O in 1? But we have E in 1? Not.

Try E in 2? Then position 2: E? A in position 4? Then N in 1 or 5? L in 3? Or what? Position 1? Must be filled by N or L? Etc.

It's getting messy. Let me try A in position 5?
Then we have A at the end? And we know A cannot be in 2 or 3? So position 5 is new? And A can be there? From the constraints? Yes.
Then:
  Position 5: A.
  Then E must be in 1,2,3? 
  N in 1,2,5? But 5 taken? So N in 1 or 2?
  L in 1,2,3,4? But 4 available?
  Fifth letter in some position.

So example: N in 1? Then E in 2 or 3? 
Then L in 3 or 4? 
Fifth letter in the remaining position.

Word: ""N E ? ? A""? Or ""N E L ? A""? 

For example: ""N E L X A"" -> ""NELXA""? No? Or ""NELLA"" but has double L? And A is in position 5? ""NELLA"" is a proper name? Or not a common word.

Another one: ""BALED"" -> but we tried? B is new? ""BALED"": B,A,L,E,D -> A in 2? But A cannot be in position 2? Because in guess2 we tried A in position 2 and it was wrong position? So A must not be in 2.

So if we put A in 5, we avoid position 2 and 3? So okay.

What are common words with A at the end? 

Like ""ULTRA"" but U,L,T,R,A -> R is absent? Cannot use R.

""MANGA"" -> M,A,N,G,A -> duplicate A? And A in positions 2 and 5? But A in 2 is forbidden? We know A must not be in 2? So ""MANGA"" has A in 2? Not allowed.

""ARENA"" -> A in 1? But also in 4? A in 1 is allowed, but we have R which is absent? And A in 1: then E in the word? Etc. Not allowed.

Back to the constraints: include A, N, E, L and one more, with positions:

Maybe we should try a word where L is in position 1? Then A in 4 or 5? Etc.

But let me list all the forbidden positions we know:

- A: cannot be in 2 or 3
- N: cannot in 3 or 4
- E: cannot in 4 or 5
- L: cannot in 5

Available positions by letter:
A: 1,4,5
N: 1,2,5
E: 1,2,3
L: 1,2,3,4

And we have to assign these letters to exactly one position each? Because no duplicates? And then assign X to the last.

But we have 5 positions and 5 letters.

So we must have one position for each: A, N, E, L, and X.

Let me try to make a position assignment.

Try position 1: which letter can go? E? Then:
  Position 1: E (allowed)
  Then for position 2: who can go? A, N, L (because E is taken)
    Try A: not allowed in 2? So no.
    Try N: allowed? Yes, because N can be in 1,2,5? But 1 taken? So 2 allowed? Yes.
      Then position 2: N. 
      Then position 3: who? A, L (E taken, N taken) -> A cannot be in 3? So only L. L in position 3? Allowed? Yes.
        Then positions 4 and 5: for A and X? But A must be in 4 or 5? 
        Also, position 4: if A is there, then position 4: A? Allowed? Yes.
        Then position 5: X? But E cannot be in 5? That's for E? But this is X? So okay. But L cannot be in 5? But we have L in 3? Safe.

        And X in 5? but we don't know what letter. So the word: E, N, L, A, X? Positions 1: E, 2: N, 3: L, 4: A, 5: X.

        This fits: ""E N L A X"" -> but not a word? We can try to find an English word ending like this? Sounds like ""EN X A"" not.

        Or if we swap: position 4: X, position 5: A? Then word: ""E N L X A"" -> ""X"" in 4, ""A"" in 5. But what words are like that? ""ENOBA"" or something? Not common.

    After position 2 being N, for position 3, if we don't put L, then only X? But then where to put L? We haven't assigned L? Then L must be in position 4? Because it cannot be in 5? So ""E, N, X, L, A""? Word: ""ENXLA""? Not a word.

Try position 1: L? 
  Then:
    Position 1: L (allowed)
    Then position 2: available for A, N, E? 
      A: cannot in 2? So no.
      N: allowed in 2? Yes.
        Then position 2: N.
        Then position 3: available for E (since A cannot be in 3, but E can be in 3) -> so E in 3? Allowed? Yes.
          Then positions 4 and 5: for A and X? But A must be in 4 or 5? 
          Position 4: A? Allowed? Yes.
          Position 5: X? Allowed? But L cannot be in 5, but this is X? So okay.

          Word: L, N, E, A, X? or ""L,N,E,X,A"" -> positions 1:L, 2:N, 3:E, 4:A, 5:X -> word ""LNEAX""? Not a word.

          Or position 4: X? position 5: A? -> ""L,N,E,X,A"" -> ""LNEXA"" not a word.

      Or for position 2: if we put E? Allowed? Yes, position 2: E? Then:
        Then position 2: E.
        Then position 3: Cannot be A? So only N or L or X? But N cannot be in 3? So L or X? Try L: position 3: L? Not forbidden? L in 3 is allowed.
          Then position 4 and 5: for A and X? A must be in 4 or 5? 
          If A in 4? A in position 4: allowed? Yes.
          Position 5: X? Then word: ""L, E, L, A, X"" duplicate L? And ""LELAX"" not a word? And we have duplicate L? Maybe not.

          Position 4: X; position 5: A? ""L,E,L,X,A""? ""LELXA"" not a word.

        If position 3: X? then in position 4 and 5: for A and N? Because N must be in 5? (since position 4 cannot for N? and position 5 is available? N can be in 5? Then: position 4 could be A? in 4: allowed? And position 5: N? allowed? So word: ""L, E, X, A, N"" -> ""LEXAN""? Is that a word?

        ""LEXAN"" is not a common English word? Maybe not.

Now, try position 1: N? 
  Allow N in 1.
  Then position 2: can be E? (since A cannot, and N taken) -> E in 2? allowed? Yes.
    Then position 2: E.
    Then position 3: can be L? (A cannot, E and N taken) -> L in 3? allowed? Then:
        Positions 4 and 5: for A and X? 
        A cannot be in 2 or 3, so could be 4 or 5? 
        If A in 4? Then X in 5: word as ""N E L A X"" -> NELAX not word.
        If A in 5? Then X in 4: ""N E L X A""-> NELXA not word.

    Or position 3: X? then positions 4 and 5: for A and L? But L must be assigned? L cannot be in 5? So L must be in 4? then A in 5? -> ""N E X L A"" -> NEXLA not word? 

We are struggling to find a word. Maybe there's a duplicate letter.

Or perhaps we missed a common word.

Another idea: fifth letter might be 'S'? of 'T'? etc.

Let me recall that in panel, we got feedback that A, N, E, L are present! So the word at this point must have exactly A, N, E, L and one more letter.

Common words: ""ELAND"" -> E, L, A, N, D -> E in 1, L in 2, A in 3? But A in 3 is forbidden.

""ANLEP""? Not a word.

""LANES"" -> L, A, N, E, S -> But A in position 2? forbidden? Because in panel we had A in 2 and it was wrong position? So A cannot be in 2.

""LEASE"" -> L, E, A, S, E -> duplicate E? And A in 3? forbidden.

""CANEL"" -> C is out? Not.

""ANGEL"" -> A, N, G, E, L.
Positions: A in 1? Allowed.
 N in 2? Allowed.
 G in 3? new letter.
 E in 4? for bidden! Because E cannot be in 4.

""AN CLE"" not.

""NUTELLA"" too long.

""FLANE"" not 5.

""ELAN plus one letter?

Perhaps the fifth letter is 'D': ""ELAND"" again, but issues.

""ENDED""-> dup E? but we know E is present, so possibly dup? But let's see.

 But in ""ENDED"", positions: E(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), D(5). But E in 1: allowed. N in 2: allowed. E in 4? forbidden! Cannot.

""LANDE"" -> L, A, N, D, E -> A in 2? forbidden.

"" DEAN"" 4 letters.

""STAND"" not L.

 Another word: ""SAL	 ET"" not.

 I recall that we haven't tried the fifth letter much. We should guess a word that has A, N, E, L in positions meeting the constraints, and a new letter.

Let me try ""ANEAR"" but R is out.

""ANELE"" -> A, N, E, L, E? duplicate E? And positions: A in 1, N in 2, E in 3, L in 4, E in 5? That's only 4 unique letters, but duplicate E.

But with duplicate E: still,positions? A in 1? Allowed. N in 2? Allowed. E in 3? Allowed. L in 4? Allowed. E in 5? Forbidden! Because E cannot be in 5. So one E in 3 is allowed, but the other in 5? Not. So not.

 Perhaps.

 Maybe ""ALANE"" . ""ALANE"" is a word? and positions: A(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), E(5) -> A in 1 allowed, L in 2 allowed? But A in 3? forbidden! And E in 5 forbidden.

Alternatively, how about E in 1, W in 2, A in 4, L in 3, N in 5? but does that form a word? ""E W A L N"" -> ""EWALN"" not a word? or ""EWANL"" no.

Perhaps ""WELง"" not.

 I think we need to search systematically.

Let's go for A in position 4? and E in position 1? which we tried before.

With E in 1, A in 4, then N in 5? and L in 2 or 3? 
If L in 2: then position 3: X? -> word: ""E L X A N"" -> ""ELXAN"" not word.
If L in 3: ""E X L A N"" -> ""EXLAN"" not word.

Or with A in 5? and E in 1, then N in 1 or 2? position 1 occupied by E? So N in 2? Then position 3: X? position 4: L? then ""E N X L A"" , so ""ENXLA"" not word.

 or position 3: L? position 4: X? ""E N L X A"" - ""EN LX A"" not.

But ""ENOLA"" is a word? ""ENOLA"": E,N,O,L,A -> positions: E(1), N(2), O(3), L(4), A(5).

Let's check the constraints:
A: position 5? allowed. (since it can be in 1,4,5)
N: position 2? allowed. (since cannot be in 3 or 4, and 2 is okay)
E: position 1? allowed.
L: position 4? allowed. (since not 5)

 fifth letter O in position 3? which is new.

Also, O has not been tried? And not C,R,P.

So ""ENOLA"" is a valid English word? Enola is a name, sometimes accepted? But we need a common word.

Perhaps ""KENE L"" no.

 another word: ""MEAN L"" with M, but then ""AN M E"" etc.

""HEALD"" only 5 if we use, but not having A in 4 or 5? etc.

Actually, ""ENOLA"" might be acceptable. But let's see if there's a better choice.

Another common word: ""LATER"" but R is out.

""WALES"" -> W,A,L,E,S -> but A in 2? forbidden.

""LANES"" . A in 2? forbidden.

""LEANS"" . L(1), E(2), A(3), N(4), S(5) -> A in 3? forbidden. N in 4? forbidden. E in 2 we haven tried but in this case, A in 3 is already invalid.

 onsecond thought, we have to bite the bullet and choose a word even if it's a name. Or is there a better?

""SANEL""? not word.

""ANELE"" with E in 5.

""EL 0 A N"" with O? 'ELOAN""? ""ELOAN"" is not a word. ""E"" loan no.

What about ""Navel"" -> N,A,V,E,L -> A in 2? for forbidden! position 2? We know A cannot be in 2.

""VALEN"" -> V,A,L,E,N -> A in 2? again forbidden.

""NE A L S"" -> ""NEALS""? as in kneecap? not.

 Perhaps ""ILEAN"" not word.

Given the difficulty, maybe there's a mistake or we need to consider that the fifth letter is S.

Try ""S a e L 0"", no.

Another idea: perhaps the secret word has duplicate letters? For instance, two N's or something? But in our guesses, we haven't seen duplicate feedback, but it's possible.

For example, maybe the word is ""L E E A N"" but E in 1 and 2, and A in 4? then N in 5? etc.

Let me try: ""LEEAN"" not a word.

""AL EEN"" not.

""ENEMA"" no L.

Recall that in feedback for guess2: L was present but not in position 5? So we know L is in the word.

New strategy: we can ignore the fifth letter for a moment and focus on placing A, N, E, L in allowed positions and forming a valid wordtem.

We know:
- A not in 2,3 -> so in 1,4,5
- N not in 3,4 -> in 1,2,5
- E not in 4,5 -> in 1,2,3
- L not in 5 -> in 1,2,3,4

Choose a word that has these four letters and an additional letter, satisfying position constraints.

Use a word finder program? But we can't, so rack brains.

Common 5-letter words with A, E, L, N:

- ""LENIENT"" too long.
- ""PLANE"" -> P is out? We know P is absent.
- ""ELANE"" not.
- ""LEANT"" -> A in 3, N in 4? forbidd.
- ""N ELAL"" no.
- ""ANEL E"" no.

 I recall that ""ELAND"" is an animal. Let's re- check positions for ""ELAND"": positions 1:E, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:D. But A in 3 is forbidden, and also E in 1 is allowed, L in 2 is allowed? New? but A in 3 is not allowed. Plus, N in 4 is not allowed. So it violates.

""Д A L E N"" L in 1, A in 2 which is not allowed.

 Another word: ""A U L N E"" not.

After exhaustive search, found: Given the constraints, a word like ""KNEEL"" has two E's? then A no 'A'. Must include A.

Perhaps ""SELEN"" only 5 letters? no.

 It's taking too long.

Let's try the word ""CANE"" only 4.
 Or ""LANE"" 4.

 One word: ""OLE IN"" not.

 I think we may have to for ""ENOLA"" as a guess. It matches all constraints and is a proper name. Or ""ALONE"" only we saw earlier? Let's check ""ALONE"": positions - A(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). 

For A: position 1? allowed? Yes.
L: position 2? allowed? Yes? (not tried before? we only know L not in 5? 2 is new)
O: position 3? new.
N: position 4? forbidden! Because in first guess N was in 4 and wrong, and in second guess we for N in 3 and wrong? and position 4 for N is not allowed? from first guess: N in 4 was wrong position? so N cannot be in 4, and here it's in 4? so we cannot use.

Another word: ""ANODE"" has A in 1, N in 2, O in 3, E in 5? forbidden for E.

""ABED"" only 4.

I think for the sake of progress, let's guess ""ENOLA"". 

 Reasons:
- Meets the position constraints:
  E in 1: allowed
  N in 2: allowed
  O in 3: new letter, not tested and not forbidden.
  L in 4: allowed
  A in 5: allowed

- Contains A, N, E, L and O as fifth letter.

- O is a vowel, hasn't been tested.

- ""Enola"" is a word (proper name, but sometimes accepted in word games).

Alternatively, is there ""LEN O A"" no. 

 We have to make a guess.

So I will guess ""ENOLA"".

But note: the feedback for duplicates? But we don't have duplicates here.

So guess: ""ENOLA""

<guess>enola</guess>

But wait, let's double-check the constraints:

Secret word must contain A, N, E, L. ""ENOLA"" has E, N, O, L, A -> yes.

Positions:

E in 1? Is there any feedback that would make E in 1 forbidden? No, because we know E should be in 1,2,3.

N in 2: and we know N should not be in 3 or 4? 2 is not 3 or 4, so ok.

L in 4: and we know L should not be in 5? 4 is not 5, so ok.

A in 5: and we know A should not be in 2 or 3? 5 is not 2 or 3, so ok.

O in 3: a new letter.

So this fits all the constraints we have.

Therefore, we guess ""ENOLA"".

However, in this feedback, we don\'t have any duplicate letters in ""crane"", so we don\'t know about duplicates. But we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don\'t say they are unique.\n\nBut in the example, they were unique. However, we should be cautious.\n\nGiven that A, N, E are in the word, and we have two more letters to find.\n\nWe also know that the word does not have C or R.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have A, N, E and two other letters that are not C or R.\n\nWe can try to put A, N, E in positions that are not 3, 4, 5? Actually, we can try any position except the ones we know are wrong? But note: we don\'t know the correct positions yet.\n\nWe have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for these letters? Actually, the feedback for A says it is in the word but not in position 3. Similarly, N is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.\n\nSo in the new guess, we can try:\n- A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5? But note: we have to form a valid word.\n- Similarly for N and E.\n\nWe also have two new letters to include.\n\nWe should try to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.\n\nBut we also want to test the positions for A, N, E.\n\nLet me try to think of a word that has A, N, E and two new consonants (since vowels are A and E, we might need more consonants).\n\nCommon letters: we can try to use S, T, L, etc.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid C and R.\n\nLet me think of words that contain A, N, E and two other letters (not C or R).\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""SAINT"": has S, A, I, N, T -> but note: we have A, N, and E? No, it doesn\'t have E. So not.\n\n- ""SANE"": but that\'s 4 letters. We need 5.\n\n- ""LEARN"": but L, E, A, R, N -> but R is not allowed (we know R is absent). So we cannot use R.\n\n- ""LEANT"": L, E, A, N, T -> this has E, A, N, and T and L. And no C or R.\n\nBut note: in ""leant"", the positions are:\nL (1), E (2), A (3), N (4), T (5)\n\nBut in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting A in position 3 again? That would be the same position. We know A is not in position 3, so we should avoid that.\n\nSo we cannot put A in position 3 again.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot put N in position 4 (because in ""crane"" it was in 4 and was wrong) and E in position 5 (same reason).\n\nSo in ""leant"", if we put A in 3 (which we know is wrong) and N in 4 (also wrong) and E in 2? But E in 2 is a new position.\n\nBut we cannot use the same position for A and N that we know are wrong.\n\nSo we need a word that has A, N, E but in positions that are not the ones we tried? Specifically, for A: avoid position 3; for N: avoid position 4; for E: avoid position 5.\n\nSo for A: we can try positions 1, 2, 4, 5.\nFor N: positions 1, 2, 3, 5.\nFor E: positions 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nWe also have two more letters to include.\n\nLet me try to form a word:\n\nOption: ""ANVIL"" -> but it doesn\'t have E or N? It has A, N, V, I, L -> no E.\n\nWe need E.\n\nOption: ""MANGE"" -> M, A, N, G, E -> but let\'s see positions:\nM(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), E(5)\n\nNow, A is in position 2 (which is allowed, because previously it was in 3 and wrong).\nN is in position 3 (allowed, because previously it was in 4 and wrong).\nE is in position 5 (but we know from the first guess that E is not in position 5? So we cannot put E in position 5 again? Because the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5. So if we put E in position 5 again, it would be the same mistake.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid putting E in position 5. Similarly, we must avoid putting A in position 3 and N in position 4.\n\nSo in ""MANGE"", E is in position 5, which is not allowed (because we know E is not in position 5). So we cannot use that.\n\nWe need a word that has E in a position other than 5.\n\nLet me try ""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> positions: A in 2, E in 4, N in 5.\n\nBut note: we cannot put N in position 4? Actually, in the first guess N was in position 4 and it was wrong. But in this word, N is in position 5? That\'s allowed because we haven\'t tried N in position 5 before? Actually, we only know that N is not in position 4. So position 5 is new.\n\nSimilarly, E is in position 4? We know E is not in position 5, but position 4 is new for E.\n\nA is in position 2? We know A is not in position 3, but position 2 is new.\n\nSo ""HAVEN"" has:\n- A in position 2 (new)\n- E in position 4 (new)\n- N in position 5 (new for N? But note: we haven\'t tried N in position 5, but we have tried E in position 5 and it was wrong, but that doesn\'t affect N).\n\nBut also, we have H and V as new letters.\n\nIs ""HAVEN"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nBut note: the word must be 5 letters and English.\n\nAnother option: ""LEANS"" -> L, E, A, N, S -> positions: E in 2, A in 3, N in 4, S in 5.\n\nBut we cannot put A in position 3 (we know it\'s wrong) and N in position 4 (also wrong). So that\'s not allowed.\n\nAnother: ""SENNA"" -> S, E, N, N, A -> but has duplicate N? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But the rules don\'t forbid. However, we have to be cautious. Also, A is in position 5? That\'s allowed. But we have two N\'s? We don\'t know if the secret word has two N\'s? But we know N is in the word, but maybe only once? We don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates for now to keep it simple.\n\nAnother word: ""ADIEU"" -> but it doesn\'t have N? We need to include N because we know it\'s in the word.\n\nWe must include A, N, E.\n\nSo let\'s try to find a word that has A, N, E and two other letters (not C or R) and positions for A, N, E that are not the ones we know are wrong.\n\nWe can try:\n\n- Position 1: A? Then we have A at start.\n- Position 2: E? \n- Position 3: N? But we know A is not in 3, but N can be in 3? Yes, because we only know N is not in 4.\n\nBut we have to form a word.\n\nWord: ""ANODE"" -> A, N, O, D, E -> positions: A(1), N(2), O(3), D(4), E(5)\n\nBut E is in position 5? We know E is not in position 5. So we cannot use that.\n\nWord: ""ALINE"" -> A, L, I, N, E -> positions: A(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), E(5)\n\nBut N is in position 4? We know N is not in position 4. And E is in position 5? Also not allowed.\n\nWord: ""AMEND"" -> A, M, E, N, D -> positions: A(1), M(2), E(3), N(4), D(5)\n\nBut N is in position 4? Not allowed.\n\nWord: ""EATEN"" -> E, A, T, E, N -> duplicate E? And E in position 1? That\'s allowed. A in position 2? Allowed. T in 3? E in 4? But we have two E\'s? And N in 5? We know E is not in position 5? But here N is in 5, which is allowed? But we have E in position 1 and 4? We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? But we only know that E is in the word (at least one). So it might have two.\n\nBut let\'s see: ""EATEN"" has E in position 1 and 4? And we know E is not in position 5, but we don\'t know about other positions. However, we are trying to avoid the known wrong positions: for E we avoid 5, for A avoid 3, for N avoid 4.\n\nIn ""EATEN"":\n- E is in 1 and 4 -> both are new (we haven\'t tried E in 1 or 4) -> so allowed.\n- A is in 2 -> new (we only tried in 3) -> allowed.\n- N is in 5 -> new (we only tried in 4) -> allowed.\n\nBut we have two E\'s? That might be acceptable.\n\nBut we are introducing T as a new letter.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""NEVER"" but that has R? We cannot use R.\n\nAnother word: ""MEANT"" -> M, E, A, N, T -> positions: E in 2? A in 3? But we cannot put A in 3. So no.\n\nWord: ""LEANT"" we already considered and it has A in 3 and N in 4, which are not allowed.\n\nWord: ""PANEL"" -> P, A, N, E, L -> positions: A in 2? (allowed, because we only know A is not in 3), N in 3? (allowed, because we only know N is not in 4), E in 4? (allowed, because we only know E is not in 5). And L in 5.\n\nSo ""PANEL"" has:\n- P (new)\n- A in 2 (new position for A)\n- N in 3 (new position for N)\n- E in 4 (new position for E)\n- L (new)\n\nAnd no C or R.\n\nThis seems valid.\n\nAnother option: ""LATEN"" -> but is that a word? I think ""laten"" is not common. Let me think of common words.\n\n""PANEL"" is a common word.\n\nWe can also consider ""SALET"" or ""TALON"", but ""TALON"" has O and N in 5? But we need E? We must include E.\n\nWe must include A, N, E.\n\nSo ""PANEL"" is a good candidate.\n\nAnother candidate: ""ANEWS"" -> not a word.\n\n""WANED"": W, A, N, E, D -> positions: A in 2, N in 3, E in 4, D in 5. This is similar to ""PANEL"" but with W and D.\n\nBut ""WANED"" is a word.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe can also consider ""AGENT"": A, G, E, N, T -> positions: A(1), G(2), E(3), N(4), T(5)\n\nBut N is in position 4? We know N is not in position 4. So we cannot use that.\n\n""AGENT"" is invalid because of N in 4.\n\n""AMENT"" -> not a word.\n\n""OAKEN"": O, A, K, E, N -> positions: A in 2, E in 4, N in 5 -> that works? A in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), N in 5 (allowed). And O and K are new.\n\nBut ""oaken"" is a word.\n\nSo we have multiple options: ""HAVEN"", ""PANEL"", ""WANED"", ""OAKEN"", etc.\n\nWe want to maximize information. We should try to include common letters that we haven\'t tested yet, such as S, T, L, D, etc.\n\nIn ""crane"", we tested C, R, A, N, E. So we know A, N, E are present and C, R are absent.\n\nWe haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe should try to cover more common consonants.\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.\n\nIn ""PANEL"", we are testing P, L and also A, N, E in new positions.\n\nIn ""HAVEN"", we test H, V.\n\nIn ""WANED"", we test W, D.\n\nIn ""OAKEN"", we test O, K.\n\nI think ""PANEL"" is a good choice because it tests P and L, which are common.\n\nAlternatively, ""SLATE"" but we don\'t have N? We must include N because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot omit N.\n\nWe must include A, N, E.\n\nSo I think ""PANEL"" is a solid choice.\n\nLet me confirm the positions in ""PANEL"":\n- P: position 1 (new letter, new position)\n- A: position 2 (we know A is in the word, but not in position 3; now we try position 2)\n- N: position 3 (we know N is in the word, but not in position 4; now we try position 3)\n- E: position 4 (we know E is in the word, but not in position 5; now we try position 4)\n- L: position 5 (new letter)\n\nThis should be acceptable.\n\nSo I will guess ""PANEL"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: absent, R: absent, A: present but wrong position, N: present but wrong position, E: present but wrong position), the following is deduced:\n- The secret word contains A, N, and E, but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively (since in ""crane"", A was in position 3, N in 4, and E in 5, and they were marked as wrong positions).\n- The letters C and R are absent from the secret word entirely.\n- The new guess must include A, N, and E in positions other than the ones previously tried (i.e., A not in position 3, N not in position 4, E not in position 5) and avoid using C or R.\n- To maximize information, the guess should introduce new common letters (e.g., P, L) and test A, N, E in new positions.\n\nThe word ""panel"" is chosen because:\n- It includes A (position 2), N (position 3), and E (position 4), all in new positions that comply with the feedback.\n- It introduces two new letters: P (position 1) and L (position 5), which are common consonants not yet tested.\n- It is a valid 5-letter English word.\n\n<guess>panel</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)\n  Meaning:\n    C: absent\n    R: absent\n    A: present but wrong position (and since it was in position 3, the correct position isn\'t 3)\n    N: present but wrong position (position 4 is wrong)\n    E: present but wrong position (position 5 is wrong)\n\nGuess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(-)\n  Meaning:\n    P: absent\n    A: present but wrong position (in panel, A was in position 2 -> so position 2 is not correct for A)\n    N: present but wrong position (in panel, N was in position 3 -> so position 3 is not correct for N)\n    E: present but wrong position (in panel, E was in position 4 -> so position 4 is not correct for E)\n    L: present but wrong position (in panel, L was in position 5 -> so position 5 is not correct for L)\n\nNow, we know the secret word:\n- Contains A, N, E, L (because they are marked present in both guesses) and does not contain C, R, P.\n- We have two new pieces of information: \n  - L is present (from guess 2), and it\'s not in position 5.\n\nAlso, from the positions:\nFor A: wrong in position 3 (from guess 1) and wrong in position 2 (from guess 2). So A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.\nSimilarly:\n  For N: wrong in position 4 (guess 1) and wrong in position 3 (guess 2). So N cannot be in positions 3 or 4.\n  For E: wrong in position 5 (guess 1) and wrong in position 4 (guess 2). So E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.\n  For L: wrong in position 5 (guess 2). We have only tried L in position 5, so it cannot be in 5, but could be in 1,2,3,4.\n\nMoreover, since the word has 5 letters and we know A, N, E, L must be in it, that accounts for 4 letters. The fifth letter is unknown (but not C, R, or P).\n\nPossible positions for A: positions 1, 4, 5? But note: we haven\'t tried position 1 or 4 for A? Actually, we tried A in 3 and 2, so positions 1,4,5 are still possible? But wait, the word must have A and it must be in one of the positions we haven\'t tried? But we have tried position 2 and 3. So only 1,4,5? But in a 5-letter word, positions are 1 to 5.\n\nSimilarly, for N: we tried in 4 (guess1) and 3 (guess2). So N cannot be in 3 or 4 -> available positions 1,2,5.\nFor E: tried in 5 (guess1) and 4 (guess2) -> cannot be in 4 or 5 -> available positions 1,2,3.\nFor L: tried only in 5 -> cannot be in 5 -> available positions 1,2,3,4.\n\nNow, we need to assign the letters A, N, E, L to positions 1 to 5 without using the forbidden positions for each, and we have one more letter to assign to the remaining position.\n\nWe also know that the fifth letter must be a letter not yet tried (or that hasn\'t been ruled out) and not C, R, P.\n\nBut note: we have only 4 letters: A, N, E, L. The word has 5 letters, so there must be a fifth letter. We don\'t know it yet.\n\nThe secret word has exactly 5 letters. We know it contains A, N, E, L and one more letter.\n\nWe must include a fifth letter that hasn\'t been guessed? We have tested only C, R, P (absent) and A, N, E, L (present). So the fifth letter could be any other letter of the alphabet.\n\nWe need to form a word that fits these constraints.\n\nLet me try to list possible positions for each:\n\n- A: must be in 1,4,5 (since not 2 or 3)\n- N: must be in 1,2,5 (since not 3 or 4)\n- E: must be in 1,2,3 (since not 4 or 5)\n- L: must be in 1,2,3,4 (since not 5)\n\nWe also have a fifth letter (say X) that goes in the remaining position.\n\nWe must assign one letter per position.\n\nAlso, note that a letter cannot be in two positions at once? Except if duplicates? But we haven\'t been told that there are duplicates, but we must consider? The feedback doesn\'t show duplicates? Actually, in feedback, each letter is marked separately, so if a letter appears twice, both would be marked? But we don\'t have any duplicates in the guesses so far, so we can\'t assume duplicates.\n\nWe\'ll assume no duplicates for now?\n\nBut let\'s see: we have 5 positions and 5 distinct letters: A, N, E, L, and X.\n\nWe need to assign A, N, E, L to 4 positions and X to the fifth.\n\nBut we cannot assign two letters to one position.\n\nSo we must allocate the positions without overlap.\n\nMoreover, the fifth letter X must be in a position that is available? Actually, we don\'t restrict X? X can be in any position? But we have to form a word.\n\nLet\'s try to see if we can find a word that fits.\n\nFirst, note that E must be in 1,2, or 3.\n\nA must be in 1,4, or 5.\n\nBut if A is in 1, then position 1 is taken by A, so E cannot be in 1? So they might conflict.\n\nSimilarly, N must be in 1,2,5.\n\nL must be in 1,2,3,4.\n\nWe have five positions, we need to assign letters to each.\n\nWe can consider the possibilities for position 1.\n\nPosition 1: could be A, N, E, L, or X? But let\'s see:\n\nSince E cannot be in 4 or 5, position 1 is available for E? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, A, N, L can be in position 1.\n\nBut let\'s list the possible assignments for the known letters:\n\nWe can try to assign A, N, E, L to four positions and leave one for X.\n\nBut we don\'t know X.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to find a word that includes A, N, E, L and one more letter, with the position constraints.\n\nLet me think of common English words containing A, N, E, L.\n\nPossible words: ""LANE"" but it\'s 4 letters. Need 5.\n\nAdding a letter: ""LEARN"" but R is absent? Can\'t use R.\n\n""LEANT"" -> has T, but we tried L in position 5? Wait, no: ""LEANT"" is L,E,A,N,T.\n\nBut in our position constraints:\n\nL: ? we haven\'t assigned, but in ""LEANT"", L is in position 1 -> allowed (we only know L not in 5).\nE is in position 2 -> allowed (E must be in 1,2,3).\nA is in position 3? But we know A cannot be in position 3. So A is in 3? Forbidden. So not.\n\n""ALIEN"" -> A,L,I,E,N.\n\nPositions:\nA in 1? -> allowed (since we haven\'t tried A in 1? Yes, and it\'s not forbidden).\nL in 2? -> allowed (we only know L not in 5; 2 is okay).\nI in 3? -> new letter.\nE in 4? -> but E cannot be in 4! Because from feedback E is not allowed in position 4 (from guess2). So E in 4 is forbidden.\n\nSo ""ALIEN"": E in 4 -> forbidden.\n\n""ALONE"" -> but O, and E in 4? Not allowed.\n\n""ANILE"" -> A,N,I,L,E -> positions: A(1), N(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). But E in 5? Forbidden! Because E cannot be in 5.\n\n""ELAND"" -> E,L,A,N,D.\n\nPosition 1: E? -> E in 1? Allowed? Yes, because E can be in 1,2,3.\nThen L in 2? -> allowed.\nA in 3? -> forbidden! A cannot be in 3.\nSo no.\n\nWe have to avoid A in positions 2 and 3? So only 1,4,5?\n\nAnd E in 1,2,3? So if A is in position 1, then E cannot be in position 1? So A and E can\'t both be in position 1? So if A is in 1, then E must be in 2 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, N in 1,2,5? If A is in 1, then N can be in 2 or 5.\n\nL in any but 5.\n\nLet\'s try:\n\nOption: A in position 1:\n  Then:\n    Position 1: A\n    Then E must be in 2 or 3.\n    N must be in 2 or 5? But position 2: if E is there, then N in 5? And L in 3 or 4? And the fifth letter in the other position.\n\n  Example word? ""ANLE?"" No.\n\n  Let me try: If A in 1, E in 2: then positions 1-A, 2-E.\n    Then position 2 is E -> no problem?\n    Then we need N and L and one more letter.\n\n    Then position 3: must be L or N? But N cannot be in position 3? Only 1,2,5? But 1 is taken, 2 taken, so N must be in 5? So N in 5? Then L can be in 3 or 4? And position 4 and 3: one for L and one for the fifth letter.\n\n    For example, word: ""A E _ _ N"" -> say ""A E L X N"" but then E is in 2? Then L in 3? Then X in 4? Then N in 5? But L in 3? Allowed? And N in 5? Also allowed? We haven\'t tried N in 5? But we know N can be in 5? Yes.\n\n    E in 2: allowed? Yes, because E rejected only from 4 and 5? So 2 is okay.\n\n    What words of the form A E L ? N: ""ae_L_N""? Not a word? ""AELXN"" doesn\'t work.\n\n    With A in 1, E in 2, N in 5: then we need L and X in positions 3 and 4.\n\n    Words: ""AXELN""? Not a word.\n\n    Is ""AGLEN"" a word? No.\n\n    Perhaps ""AVEL N""? Not 5 letters.\n\n    Or ""A E X L N"" -> I can think of ""EXAM"" but not.\n\nAnother possibility: A in 1, E in 3? Then:\n  Positions: 1-A, 3-E\n  E in 3: allowed? Yes, because E can be in 1,2,3? So 3 is okay.\n  Then N must be in 2 or 5? Because positions available: 2,4,5? But N can be in 1,2,5? But 1 taken? So 2 or 5.\n  L can be in 2,4? But 2 might be taken? Also, position 4 and 5? And the fifth letter.\n\nCase: N in position 2? Then we have A(1), N(2), E(3), then positions 4 and 5: L and fifth letter? But L cannot be in 5? So L must be in 4? And fifth letter in 5? Then the word is ""A N E L X"" -> ""ANELX""? Not a word.\n\nCase: N in position 5? Then we have A(1), ?, E(3), ?, N(5). So positions 2 and 4: for L and X? L can be in 4? Then X in 2? Or L in 2? So word: ""A X E L N"" -> ""AXELN"" not a word? Or ""A L E X N"" -> ""ALEXN"" not a word? ""ALIEN"" we tried already? But E is in 3? And if we put L in 2, X in 4? ""ALEXN"" is not a word? Or ""ALEFN"" no. \n\nAlternatively, we can try A in position 4 or 5.\n\nTry A in position 4?\nThen: \n  A in 4: that is allowed? Because we know A not in 2 or 3? So position 4 is new.\n  Now, we need to assign E, N, L.\n  E must be in 1,2,3? \n  N must be in 1,2,5?\n  L must be in 1,2,3,4? But 4 is taken by A? So L in 1,2,3?\n\n  So for E: 1,2,3? \n  Let me put E in position 1? Then we have position 1: E? Allowed? Yes.\n  Then N in 2 or 5? \n  L in 3? Or 2? \n  And fifth letter in the other.\n\n  Example: E in 1, then N in 2? Then L in 3? Then A in 4? Then position 5: fifth letter? So word: ""E N L A X"" -> ""ENLAX"" not a word? Or ""E N L A ?"" \n\n  Or put E in 1, then N in 5? Then word: E ? ? A N? Then we need L? In positions 2 or 3? And X in the other? So ""E X1 X2 A N"" -> and L must be in 2 or 3? So for example: ""E L ? A N""? But we need a letter in position 3? ""EL*AN"" -> like ""ELPAN"" but P is out? Or ""ELVAN"" ? ""ELVAN"" is not a word? Or ""ELDAN""? Not English.\n\n  ""OLEAN"" but O is a letter? And we have A in 4? But O in 1? But we have E in 1? Not.\n\nTry E in 2? Then position 2: E? A in position 4? Then N in 1 or 5? L in 3? Or what? Position 1? Must be filled by N or L? Etc.\n\nIt\'s getting messy. Let me try A in position 5?\nThen we have A at the end? And we know A cannot be in 2 or 3? So position 5 is new? And A can be there? From the constraints? Yes.\nThen:\n  Position 5: A.\n  Then E must be in 1,2,3? \n  N in 1,2,5? But 5 taken? So N in 1 or 2?\n  L in 1,2,3,4? But 4 available?\n  Fifth letter in some position.\n\nSo example: N in 1? Then E in 2 or 3? \nThen L in 3 or 4? \nFifth letter in the remaining position.\n\nWord: ""N E ? ? A""? Or ""N E L ? A""? \n\nFor example: ""N E L X A"" -> ""NELXA""? No? Or ""NELLA"" but has double L? And A is in position 5? ""NELLA"" is a proper name? Or not a common word.\n\nAnother one: ""BALED"" -> but we tried? B is new? ""BALED"": B,A,L,E,D -> A in 2? But A cannot be in position 2? Because in guess2 we tried A in position 2 and it was wrong position? So A must not be in 2.\n\nSo if we put A in 5, we avoid position 2 and 3? So okay.\n\nWhat are common words with A at the end? \n\nLike ""ULTRA"" but U,L,T,R,A -> R is absent? Cannot use R.\n\n""MANGA"" -> M,A,N,G,A -> duplicate A? And A in positions 2 and 5? But A in 2 is forbidden? We know A must not be in 2? So ""MANGA"" has A in 2? Not allowed.\n\n""ARENA"" -> A in 1? But also in 4? A in 1 is allowed, but we have R which is absent? And A in 1: then E in the word? Etc. Not allowed.\n\nBack to the constraints: include A, N, E, L and one more, with positions:\n\nMaybe we should try a word where L is in position 1? Then A in 4 or 5? Etc.\n\nBut let me list all the forbidden positions we know:\n\n- A: cannot be in 2 or 3\n- N: cannot in 3 or 4\n- E: cannot in 4 or 5\n- L: cannot in 5\n\nAvailable positions by letter:\nA: 1,4,5\nN: 1,2,5\nE: 1,2,3\nL: 1,2,3,4\n\nAnd we have to assign these letters to exactly one position each? Because no duplicates? And then assign X to the last.\n\nBut we have 5 positions and 5 letters.\n\nSo we must have one position for each: A, N, E, L, and X.\n\nLet me try to make a position assignment.\n\nTry position 1: which letter can go? E? Then:\n  Position 1: E (allowed)\n  Then for position 2: who can go? A, N, L (because E is taken)\n    Try A: not allowed in 2? So no.\n    Try N: allowed? Yes, because N can be in 1,2,5? But 1 taken? So 2 allowed? Yes.\n      Then position 2: N. \n      Then position 3: who? A, L (E taken, N taken) -> A cannot be in 3? So only L. L in position 3? Allowed? Yes.\n        Then positions 4 and 5: for A and X? But A must be in 4 or 5? \n        Also, position 4: if A is there, then position 4: A? Allowed? Yes.\n        Then position 5: X? But E cannot be in 5? That\'s for E? But this is X? So okay. But L cannot be in 5? But we have L in 3? Safe.\n\n        And X in 5? but we don\'t know what letter. So the word: E, N, L, A, X? Positions 1: E, 2: N, 3: L, 4: A, 5: X.\n\n        This fits: ""E N L A X"" -> but not a word? We can try to find an English word ending like this? Sounds like ""EN X A"" not.\n\n        Or if we swap: position 4: X, position 5: A? Then word: ""E N L X A"" -> ""X"" in 4, ""A"" in 5. But what words are like that? ""ENOBA"" or something? Not common.\n\n    After position 2 being N, for position 3, if we don\'t put L, then only X? But then where to put L? We haven\'t assigned L? Then L must be in position 4? Because it cannot be in 5? So ""E, N, X, L, A""? Word: ""ENXLA""? Not a word.\n\nTry position 1: L? \n  Then:\n    Position 1: L (allowed)\n    Then position 2: available for A, N, E? \n      A: cannot in 2? So no.\n      N: allowed in 2? Yes.\n        Then position 2: N.\n        Then position 3: available for E (since A cannot be in 3, but E can be in 3) -> so E in 3? Allowed? Yes.\n          Then positions 4 and 5: for A and X? But A must be in 4 or 5? \n          Position 4: A? Allowed? Yes.\n          Position 5: X? Allowed? But L cannot be in 5, but this is X? So okay.\n\n          Word: L, N, E, A, X? or ""L,N,E,X,A"" -> positions 1:L, 2:N, 3:E, 4:A, 5:X -> word ""LNEAX""? Not a word.\n\n          Or position 4: X? position 5: A? -> ""L,N,E,X,A"" -> ""LNEXA"" not a word.\n\n      Or for position 2: if we put E? Allowed? Yes, position 2: E? Then:\n        Then position 2: E.\n        Then position 3: Cannot be A? So only N or L or X? But N cannot be in 3? So L or X? Try L: position 3: L? Not forbidden? L in 3 is allowed.\n          Then position 4 and 5: for A and X? A must be in 4 or 5? \n          If A in 4? A in position 4: allowed? Yes.\n          Position 5: X? Then word: ""L, E, L, A, X"" duplicate L? And ""LELAX"" not a word? And we have duplicate L? Maybe not.\n\n          Position 4: X; position 5: A? ""L,E,L,X,A""? ""LELXA"" not a word.\n\n        If position 3: X? then in position 4 and 5: for A and N? Because N must be in 5? (since position 4 cannot for N? and position 5 is available? N can be in 5? Then: position 4 could be A? in 4: allowed? And position 5: N? allowed? So word: ""L, E, X, A, N"" -> ""LEXAN""? Is that a word?\n\n        ""LEXAN"" is not a common English word? Maybe not.\n\nNow, try position 1: N? \n  Allow N in 1.\n  Then position 2: can be E? (since A cannot, and N taken) -> E in 2? allowed? Yes.\n    Then position 2: E.\n    Then position 3: can be L? (A cannot, E and N taken) -> L in 3? allowed? Then:\n        Positions 4 and 5: for A and X? \n        A cannot be in 2 or 3, so could be 4 or 5? \n        If A in 4? Then X in 5: word as ""N E L A X"" -> NELAX not word.\n        If A in 5? Then X in 4: ""N E L X A""-> NELXA not word.\n\n    Or position 3: X? then positions 4 and 5: for A and L? But L must be assigned? L cannot be in 5? So L must be in 4? then A in 5? -> ""N E X L A"" -> NEXLA not word? \n\nWe are struggling to find a word. Maybe there\'s a duplicate letter.\n\nOr perhaps we missed a common word.\n\nAnother idea: fifth letter might be \'S\'? of \'T\'? etc.\n\nLet me recall that in panel, we got feedback that A, N, E, L are present! So the word at this point must have exactly A, N, E, L and one more letter.\n\nCommon words: ""ELAND"" -> E, L, A, N, D -> E in 1, L in 2, A in 3? But A in 3 is forbidden.\n\n""ANLEP""? Not a word.\n\n""LANES"" -> L, A, N, E, S -> But A in position 2? forbidden? Because in panel we had A in 2 and it was wrong position? So A cannot be in 2.\n\n""LEASE"" -> L, E, A, S, E -> duplicate E? And A in 3? forbidden.\n\n""CANEL"" -> C is out? Not.\n\n""ANGEL"" -> A, N, G, E, L.\nPositions: A in 1? Allowed.\n N in 2? Allowed.\n G in 3? new letter.\n E in 4? for bidden! Because E cannot be in 4.\n\n""AN CLE"" not.\n\n""NUTELLA"" too long.\n\n""FLANE"" not 5.\n\n""ELAN plus one letter?\n\nPerhaps the fifth letter is \'D\': ""ELAND"" again, but issues.\n\n""ENDED""-> dup E? but we know E is present, so possibly dup? But let\'s see.\n\n But in ""ENDED"", positions: E(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), D(5). But E in 1: allowed. N in 2: allowed. E in 4? forbidden! Cannot.\n\n""LANDE"" -> L, A, N, D, E -> A in 2? forbidden.\n\n"" DEAN"" 4 letters.\n\n""STAND"" not L.\n\n Another word: ""SAL\t ET"" not.\n\n I recall that we haven\'t tried the fifth letter much. We should guess a word that has A, N, E, L in positions meeting the constraints, and a new letter.\n\nLet me try ""ANEAR"" but R is out.\n\n""ANELE"" -> A, N, E, L, E? duplicate E? And positions: A in 1, N in 2, E in 3, L in 4, E in 5? That\'s only 4 unique letters, but duplicate E.\n\nBut with duplicate E: still,positions? A in 1? Allowed. N in 2? Allowed. E in 3? Allowed. L in 4? Allowed. E in 5? Forbidden! Because E cannot be in 5. So one E in 3 is allowed, but the other in 5? Not. So not.\n\n Perhaps.\n\n Maybe ""ALANE"" . ""ALANE"" is a word? and positions: A(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), E(5) -> A in 1 allowed, L in 2 allowed? But A in 3? forbidden! And E in 5 forbidden.\n\nAlternatively, how about E in 1, W in 2, A in 4, L in 3, N in 5? but does that form a word? ""E W A L N"" -> ""EWALN"" not a word? or ""EWANL"" no.\n\nPerhaps ""WELง"" not.\n\n I think we need to search systematically.\n\nLet\'s go for A in position 4? and E in position 1? which we tried before.\n\nWith E in 1, A in 4, then N in 5? and L in 2 or 3? \nIf L in 2: then position 3: X? -> word: ""E L X A N"" -> ""ELXAN"" not word.\nIf L in 3: ""E X L A N"" -> ""EXLAN"" not word.\n\nOr with A in 5? and E in 1, then N in 1 or 2? position 1 occupied by E? So N in 2? Then position 3: X? position 4: L? then ""E N X L A"" , so ""ENXLA"" not word.\n\n or position 3: L? position 4: X? ""E N L X A"" - ""EN LX A"" not.\n\nBut ""ENOLA"" is a word? ""ENOLA"": E,N,O,L,A -> positions: E(1), N(2), O(3), L(4), A(5).\n\nLet\'s check the constraints:\nA: position 5? allowed. (since it can be in 1,4,5)\nN: position 2? allowed.

Or is there a better?\n\n""SANEL""? not word.\n\n""ANELE"" with E in 5.\n\n""EL 0 A N"" with O? \'ELOAN""? ""ELOAN"" is not a word. ""E"" loan no.\n\nWhat about ""Navel"" -> N,A,V,E,L -> A in 2? for forbidden! position 2?

For instance, two N\'s or something? But in our guesses, we haven\'t seen duplicate feedback, but it\'s possible.\n\nFor example, maybe the word is ""L E E A N"" but E in 1 and 2, and A in 4? then N in 5? etc.\n\nLet me try: ""LEEAN"" not a word.\n\n""AL EEN"" not.\n\n""ENEMA"" no L.\n\nRecall that in feedback for guess2: L was present but not in position 5? So we know L is in the word.\n\nNew strategy: we can ignore the fifth letter for a moment and focus on placing A, N, E, L in allowed positions and forming a valid wordtem.\n\nWe know:\n- A not in 2,3 -> so in 1,4,5\n- N not in 3,4 -> in 1,2,5\n- E not in 4,5 -> in 1,2,3\n- L not in 5 -> in 1,2,3,4\n\nChoose a word that has these four letters and an additional letter, satisfying position constraints.\n\nUse a word finder program?

We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(absent), R(absent), A(present but wrong position), N(present but wrong position), E(present but wrong position)
2. ""panel"": P(absent), A(present but wrong position), N(present but wrong position), E(present but wrong position), L(present but wrong position)
3. ""enola"": E(present but wrong position), N(present but wrong position), O(absent), L(present but wrong position), A(present but wrong position)

From this, we know:
- The letters C, R, P, O are absent.
- The letters A, N, E, L are present (each is ""present"" in all guesses where they appeared).
- We have position constraints for A, N, E, L based on previous feedback.

Specifically, let's list the correct and forbidden positions for each letter:

**For A:**
- In ""crane"" (position 3), A was marked wrong position → so correct position is not 3.
- In ""panel"" (position 2), A was marked wrong position → not 2.
- In ""enola"" (position 5), A was marked wrong position → not 5.
- Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 4 (since positions 2,3,5 are forbidden).

**For N:**
- In ""crane"" (position 4), wrong position → not 4.
- In ""panel"" (position 3), wrong position → not 3.
- In ""enola"" (position 2), wrong position → not 2.
- Therefore, N must be in position 1 or 5 (since positions 2,3,4 are forbidden).

**For E:**
- In ""crane"" (position 5), wrong position → not 5.
- In ""panel"" (position 4), wrong position → not 4.
- In ""enola"" (position 1), wrong position → not 1.
- Therefore, E must be in position 2 or 3 (since positions 1,4,5 are forbidden).

**For L:**
- In ""panel"" (position 5), wrong position → not 5.
- In ""enola"" (position 4), wrong position → not 4.
- Therefore, L must be in position 1,2, or 3 (since positions 4 and 5 are forbidden).

We also know that the word contains exactly these four letters (A, N, E, L) and one additional letter that is not C, R, P, O. This fifth letter must be one we haven't guessed yet, and it cannot be any of the absent letters.

Now, let's consider possible consistent placements:

1. **N position:** N must be in 1 or 5.
2. **A position:** A must be in 1 or 4.
3. **E position:** E must be in 2 or 3.
4. **L position:** L must be in 1,2,3.

But note: positions must be distinct. 

**Case 1: N in position 1**
Then:
- Position 1: N
- A cannot be in 1, so A must be in 4 (since other options forbidden).
- E must be in 2 or 3.
- L must be in 2 or 3 (but cannot conflict with E).

So possible subcases:
- If E in 2, L in 3: Then positions: 1=N, 2=E, 3=L, 4=A, 5=? (fifth letter)
- If E in 3, L in 2: Then positions: 1=N, 2=L, 3=E, 4=A, 5=?

In both subcases, position 5 is the fifth letter.

**Case 2: N in position 5**
Then:
- Position 5: N
- A must be in 1 or 4.
- E must be in 2 or 3.
- L must be in 1,2,3.

If A in 1:
- Position 1: A
- Positions 2,3: for E and L? 
- E in 2 or 3, L in the other.
- For example: E in 2, L in 3 or E in 3, L in 2.
- Then position 4: fifth letter.

If A in 4:
- Position 4: A
- Position 1: then could be L (since L can be in 1) or fifth letter?
- Position 5: N, so 5 is taken.
- E must be in 2 or 3.
- L must be in 1,2,3.

Subcases:
- If L in 1: then E in 2 or 3: positions 1=L, 2=E (or E in 3), 3=? (if E in 2, then position 3 could be fifth letter; if E in 3, position 2 could be fifth letter).
- Or L in 2 or 3.

But this may be messy. Let's list possible words consistent with the feedback.

Given the constraints, we should form a guess that tests the possible placements and introduces a new letter.

Since we know the word has A, N, E, L, we can aim for a word that satisfies one of the above cases.

For example, take Case 1 with N in 1, E in 2, L in 3, A in 4: then the word would be N, E, L, A, ? for position 5. We need a fifth letter, say X, and it must be a valid English word ""NELAX"" – not a valid word.

Similarly, with N in 1, E in 3, L in 2: ""N, L, E, A, X"" → ""NLEAX"" – not valid.

Now Case 2: N in 5.
Subcase: A in 1, E in 2, L in 3: ""A, E, L, X, N"" for positions 1-5 → A E L X N. Is ""ELXN"" a word? No.

A in 1, E in 2, L in 3: word would be A, E, L, ?, N → ""A E L X N"" → e.g., ""aelxn"" not word.

But if instead of having the fifth letter in position 4, note that positions: 1=A, 2=E, 3=L, 4=?, 5=N. We need a word like ""A E L _ N"". 

What English words fit this pattern? 
- ""alien"" but we tried already? Alien has I, but not N at the end. ""Alien"" is A,L,I,E,N, which has E in 4? Not our pattern.

Pattern: positions 1:A, 2:E, 3:L, 4:?, 5:N. So ""AEL?N"". 

Examples: ""AELIN"" not word. ""AELON"" not. Perhaps ""alkin"" no.

Alternatively, subcase: A in 1, E in 3, L in 2: ""A, L, E, X, N"" → ""A L E X N"". Words: ""alexn"" not, but ""ALEX"" is 4 letters. Not.

Try possible word: In the feedback for ""enola"", L is in position 4 and marked wrong position, but in our case we are putting L in other positions.

Another pattern from Case 2 with N in 5: A in 4, then L in 1, then E in 2 or 3.

Suppose L in 1, E in 2, A in 4, N in 5: then positions 1=L, 2=E, 3=?, 4=A, 5=N. So word ""L E ? A N"".

What words? Like ""L E M A N"" (leman) which is a word, meaning a lover or sweetheart. Also, ""le""gan"" etc.

""LEMAN"" is a valid English word! Let's check constraints:

- Positions: L(1), E(2), M(3), A(4), N(5)

Check against feedback:
- L: in position 1 – we have not tried L in 1 before? And our constraints say L can be in 1? Yes, since L not in 4 or 5.
- E: in position 2 – E must be in 2 or 3? Yes.
- A: in position 4 – A can be in 1 or 4? Yes.
- N: in position 5 – N can be in 1 or 5? Yes.

New letter M, which hasn't been guessed, so not known to be absent.

Additionally, M is not C, R, P, O, so allowed.

Moreover, in previous guesses: 
- ""crane"" tested C,R,A,N,E – M not tested.
- ""panel"" tested P,A,N,E,L – M not tested.
- ""enola"" tested E,N,O,L,A – O tested and absent, M not tested.

So ""LEMAN"" should be a good guess.

Confirm the word: L E M A N.

Now, let's see if it fits all feedback:

- No known absent letters: C, R, P, O are absent, but M is new.
- Positions: L is in 1 (not 4 or 5), E in 2 (not 1,4,5), A in 4 (not 2,3,5), N in 5 (not 2,3,4).

Also, the fifth letter M in position 3.

This satisfies all known information.

Therefore, we guess ""LEMAN"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, R are absent; A, N, E are present but in wrong positions (not 3, 4, or 5 respectively).
- **Guess 2 (""panel"")**: P is absent; A, N, E, L are present but in wrong positions (A not 2, N not 3, E not 4, L not 5).
- **Guess 3 (""enola"")**: O is absent; E, N, L, A are present but in wrong positions (E not 1, N not 2, L not 4, A not 5).

### Analysis:
1. **Absent letters**: C, R, P, O are confirmed absent. All other letters not ruled out are possible.
2. **Present letters**: A, N, E, L are in the word but must be placed in positions consistent with feedback:
   - **A**: Must not be in positions 2, 3, or 5 → Allowed positions: 1 or 4.
   - **N**: Must not be in positions 2, 3, or 4 → Allowed positions: 1 or 5.
   - **E**: Must not be in positions 1, 4, or 5 → Allowed positions: 2 or 3.
   - **L**: Must not be in positions 4 or 5 → Allowed positions: 1, 2, or 3.
3. **Word composition**: The secret word consists of A, N, E, L, and one unknown letter (excluding C, R, P, O). This unknown letter must be new.
4. **Possible configurations**: Considering constraints:
   - If N is in position 1 (allowed), A must be in position 4 (since A cannot be in 1 if N is there). E must be in 2 or 3, L in the remaining position of 2 or 3, leaving position 5 for the fifth letter → Leads to invalid word patterns (e.g., ""NELAX"").
   - If N is in position 5 (allowed), A could be in 1 or 4:
     - If A in position 1, E and L must be in positions 2 and 3 → Leaves position 4 for the fifth letter. Words like ""AELXN"" are invalid.
     - If A in position 4, L could be in position 1 → Leaves E in 2 or 3 and position 3 or 2 for the fifth letter. This yields ""L E ? A N"". A valid English word fitting this pattern is ""LEMAN"" (L in position 1, E in 2, fifth letter M in 3, A in 4, N in 5).

""LEMAN"" satisfies all feedback:
- L (position 1) → Not tried before; no conflict since L cannot be in 4/5.
- E (position 2) → Allowed (E must be in 2/3).
- M (new letter) → Not ruled out (not C, R, P, O).
- A (position 4) → Allowed (A must be in 1/4).
- N (position 5) → Allowed (not in 2/3/4).

This guess tests M as the fifth unknown letter and checks all position constraints efficiently.

<guess>leman</guess>",leman,"We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(absent), R(absent), A(present but wrong position), N(present but wrong position), E(present but wrong position)
2. ""panel"": P(absent), A(present but wrong position), N(present but wrong position), E(present but wrong position), L(present but wrong position)
3. ""enola"": E(present but wrong position), N(present but wrong position), O(absent), L(present but wrong position), A(present but wrong position)

From this, we know:
- The letters C, R, P, O are absent.
- The letters A, N, E, L are present (each is ""present"" in all guesses where they appeared).
- We have position constraints for A, N, E, L based on previous feedback.

Specifically, let's list the correct and forbidden positions for each letter:

**For A:**
- In ""crane"" (position 3), A was marked wrong position → so correct position is not 3.
- In ""panel"" (position 2), A was marked wrong position → not 2.
- In ""enola"" (position 5), A was marked wrong position → not 5.
- Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 4 (since positions 2,3,5 are forbidden).

**For N:**
- In ""crane"" (position 4), wrong position → not 4.
- In ""panel"" (position 3), wrong position → not 3.
- In ""enola"" (position 2), wrong position → not 2.
- Therefore, N must be in position 1 or 5 (since positions 2,3,4 are forbidden).

**For E:**
- In ""crane"" (position 5), wrong position → not 5.
- In ""panel"" (position 4), wrong position → not 4.
- In ""enola"" (position 1), wrong position → not 1.
- Therefore, E must be in position 2 or 3 (since positions 1,4,5 are forbidden).

**For L:**
- In ""panel"" (position 5), wrong position → not 5.
- In ""enola"" (position 4), wrong position → not 4.
- Therefore, L must be in position 1,2, or 3 (since positions 4 and 5 are forbidden).

We also know that the word contains exactly these four letters (A, N, E, L) and one additional letter that is not C, R, P, O. This fifth letter must be one we haven't guessed yet, and it cannot be any of the absent letters.

Now, let's consider possible consistent placements:

1. **N position:** N must be in 1 or 5.
2. **A position:** A must be in 1 or 4.
3. **E position:** E must be in 2 or 3.
4. **L position:** L must be in 1,2,3.

But note: positions must be distinct. 

**Case 1: N in position 1**
Then:
- Position 1: N
- A cannot be in 1, so A must be in 4 (since other options forbidden).
- E must be in 2 or 3.
- L must be in 2 or 3 (but cannot conflict with E).

So possible subcases:
- If E in 2, L in 3: Then positions: 1=N, 2=E, 3=L, 4=A, 5=? (fifth letter)
- If E in 3, L in 2: Then positions: 1=N, 2=L, 3=E, 4=A, 5=?

In both subcases, position 5 is the fifth letter.

**Case 2: N in position 5**
Then:
- Position 5: N
- A must be in 1 or 4.
- E must be in 2 or 3.
- L must be in 1,2,3.

If A in 1:
- Position 1: A
- Positions 2,3: for E and L? 
- E in 2 or 3, L in the other.
- For example: E in 2, L in 3 or E in 3, L in 2.
- Then position 4: fifth letter.

If A in 4:
- Position 4: A
- Position 1: then could be L (since L can be in 1) or fifth letter?
- Position 5: N, so 5 is taken.
- E must be in 2 or 3.
- L must be in 1,2,3.

Subcases:
- If L in 1: then E in 2 or 3: positions 1=L, 2=E (or E in 3), 3=? (if E in 2, then position 3 could be fifth letter; if E in 3, position 2 could be fifth letter).
- Or L in 2 or 3.

But this may be messy. Let's list possible words consistent with the feedback.

Given the constraints, we should form a guess that tests the possible placements and introduces a new letter.

Since we know the word has A, N, E, L, we can aim for a word that satisfies one of the above cases.

For example, take Case 1 with N in 1, E in 2, L in 3, A in 4: then the word would be N, E, L, A, ? for position 5. We need a fifth letter, say X, and it must be a valid English word ""NELAX"" – not a valid word.

Similarly, with N in 1, E in 3, L in 2: ""N, L, E, A, X"" → ""NLEAX"" – not valid.

Now Case 2: N in 5.
Subcase: A in 1, E in 2, L in 3: ""A, E, L, X, N"" for positions 1-5 → A E L X N. Is ""ELXN"" a word? No.

A in 1, E in 2, L in 3: word would be A, E, L, ?, N → ""A E L X N"" → e.g., ""aelxn"" not word.

But if instead of having the fifth letter in position 4, note that positions: 1=A, 2=E, 3=L, 4=?, 5=N. We need a word like ""A E L _ N"". 

What English words fit this pattern? 
- ""alien"" but we tried already? Alien has I, but not N at the end. ""Alien"" is A,L,I,E,N, which has E in 4? Not our pattern.

Pattern: positions 1:A, 2:E, 3:L, 4:?, 5:N. So ""AEL?N"". 

Examples: ""AELIN"" not word. ""AELON"" not. Perhaps ""alkin"" no.

Alternatively, subcase: A in 1, E in 3, L in 2: ""A, L, E, X, N"" → ""A L E X N"". Words: ""alexn"" not, but ""ALEX"" is 4 letters. Not.

Try possible word: In the feedback for ""enola"", L is in position 4 and marked wrong position, but in our case we are putting L in other positions.

Another pattern from Case 2 with N in 5: A in 4, then L in 1, then E in 2 or 3.

Suppose L in 1, E in 2, A in 4, N in 5: then positions 1=L, 2=E, 3=?, 4=A, 5=N. So word ""L E ? A N"".

What words? Like ""L E M A N"" (leman) which is a word, meaning a lover or sweetheart. Also, ""le""gan"" etc.

""LEMAN"" is a valid English word! Let's check constraints:

- Positions: L(1), E(2), M(3), A(4), N(5)

Check against feedback:
- L: in position 1 – we have not tried L in 1 before? And our constraints say L can be in 1? Yes, since L not in 4 or 5.
- E: in position 2 – E must be in 2 or 3? Yes.
- A: in position 4 – A can be in 1 or 4? Yes.
- N: in position 5 – N can be in 1 or 5? Yes.

New letter M, which hasn't been guessed, so not known to be absent.

Additionally, M is not C, R, P, O, so allowed.

Moreover, in previous guesses: 
- ""crane"" tested C,R,A,N,E – M not tested.
- ""panel"" tested P,A,N,E,L – M not tested.
- ""enola"" tested E,N,O,L,A – O tested and absent, M not tested.

So ""LEMAN"" should be a good guess.

Confirm the word: L E M A N.

Now, let's see if it fits all feedback:

- No known absent letters: C, R, P, O are absent, but M is new.
- Positions: L is in 1 (not 4 or 5), E in 2 (not 1,4,5), A in 4 (not 2,3,5), N in 5 (not 2,3,4).

Also, the fifth letter M in position 3.

This satisfies all known information.

Therefore, we guess ""LEMAN"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, R are absent; A, N, E are present but in wrong positions (not 3, 4, or 5 respectively).
- **Guess 2 (""panel"")**: P is absent; A, N, E, L are present but in wrong positions (A not 2, N not 3, E not 4, L not 5).
- **Guess 3 (""enola"")**: O is absent; E, N, L, A are present but in wrong positions (E not 1, N not 2, L not 4, A not 5).

### Analysis:
1. **Absent letters**: C, R, P, O are confirmed absent. All other letters not ruled out are possible.
2. **Present letters**: A, N, E, L are in the word but must be placed in positions consistent with feedback:
   - **A**: Must not be in positions 2, 3, or 5 → Allowed positions: 1 or 4.
   - **N**: Must not be in positions 2, 3, or 4 → Allowed positions: 1 or 5.
   - **E**: Must not be in positions 1, 4, or 5 → Allowed positions: 2 or 3.
   - **L**: Must not be in positions 4 or 5 → Allowed positions: 1, 2, or 3.
3. **Word composition**: The secret word consists of A, N, E, L, and one unknown letter (excluding C, R, P, O). This unknown letter must be new.
4. **Possible configurations**: Considering constraints:
   - If N is in position 1 (allowed), A must be in position 4 (since A cannot be in 1 if N is there). E must be in 2 or 3, L in the remaining position of 2 or 3, leaving position 5 for the fifth letter → Leads to invalid word patterns (e.g., ""NELAX"").
   - If N is in position 5 (allowed), A could be in 1 or 4:
     - If A in position 1, E and L must be in positions 2 and 3 → Leaves position 4 for the fifth letter. Words like ""AELXN"" are invalid.
     - If A in position 4, L could be in position 1 → Leaves E in 2 or 3 and position 3 or 2 for the fifth letter. This yields ""L E ? A N"". A valid English word fitting this pattern is ""LEMAN"" (L in position 1, E in 2, fifth letter M in 3, A in 4, N in 5).

""LEMAN"" satisfies all feedback:
- L (position 1) → Not tried before; no conflict since L cannot be in 4/5.
- E (position 2) → Allowed (E must be in 2/3).
- M (new letter) → Not ruled out (not C, R, P, O).
- A (position 4) → Allowed (A must be in 1/4).
- N (position 5) → Allowed (not in 2/3/4).

This guess tests M as the fifth unknown letter and checks all position constraints efficiently.",Guess 4: leman -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(-) M(x) A(✓) N(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,GLEAN,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to make an initial guess.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C and R are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters A, N, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".

Since ""crane"" had A in the 3rd position, N in the 4th, and E in the 5th, and they are in the word but not in those positions, we must place them elsewhere.

We also know that the secret word does not contain C or R.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Does not include C or R (since they are absent)
- Includes A, N, and E (because they are present) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
- We can include two new letters to test.

We have to avoid the positions for A, N, E as in the first guess? Actually, the feedback says they are in the word but not in those positions, so in the new guess we can try them in different positions.

But note: the feedback does not prevent us from trying the same letter again in a different position? Actually, we know A, N, E are in the word, so we can try to place them in other positions to find the correct one.

We also have two more letters to guess? The word is 5 letters, so we have two more letters that we don't know.

We should choose a word that:
- Contains A, N, E (since they are in the word) but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively? Actually, we can try A in a different position, same for N and E.

But note: the feedback doesn't tell us that the same letter might appear multiple times? However, in this feedback, we don't have any duplicate letters in ""crane"", so we don't know about duplicates. But we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don't say they are unique.

But in the example, they were unique. However, we should be cautious.

Given that A, N, E are in the word, and we have two more letters to find.

We also know that the word does not have C or R.

Let's think of words that have A, N, E and two other letters that are not C or R.

We can try to put A, N, E in positions that are not 3, 4, 5? Actually, we can try any position except the ones we know are wrong? But note: we don't know the correct positions yet.

We have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for these letters? Actually, the feedback for A says it is in the word but not in position 3. Similarly, N is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

So in the new guess, we can try:
- A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5? But note: we have to form a valid word.
- Similarly for N and E.

We also have two new letters to include.

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.

But we also want to test the positions for A, N, E.

Let me try to think of a word that has A, N, E and two new consonants (since vowels are A and E, we might need more consonants).

Common letters: we can try to use S, T, L, etc.

But note: we have to avoid C and R.

Let me think of words that contain A, N, E and two other letters (not C or R).

Possible words:

- ""SAINT"": has S, A, I, N, T -> but note: we have A, N, and E? No, it doesn't have E. So not.

- ""SANE"": but that's 4 letters. We need 5.

- ""LEARN"": but L, E, A, R, N -> but R is not allowed (we know R is absent). So we cannot use R.

- ""LEANT"": L, E, A, N, T -> this has E, A, N, and T and L. And no C or R.

But note: in ""leant"", the positions are:
L (1), E (2), A (3), N (4), T (5)

But in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting A in position 3 again? That would be the same position. We know A is not in position 3, so we should avoid that.

So we cannot put A in position 3 again.

Similarly, we cannot put N in position 4 (because in ""crane"" it was in 4 and was wrong) and E in position 5 (same reason).

So in ""leant"", if we put A in 3 (which we know is wrong) and N in 4 (also wrong) and E in 2? But E in 2 is a new position.

But we cannot use the same position for A and N that we know are wrong.

So we need a word that has A, N, E but in positions that are not the ones we tried? Specifically, for A: avoid position 3; for N: avoid position 4; for E: avoid position 5.

So for A: we can try positions 1, 2, 4, 5.
For N: positions 1, 2, 3, 5.
For E: positions 1, 2, 3, 4.

We also have two more letters to include.

Let me try to form a word:

Option: ""ANVIL"" -> but it doesn't have E or N? It has A, N, V, I, L -> no E.

We need E.

Option: ""MANGE"" -> M, A, N, G, E -> but let's see positions:
M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), E(5)

Now, A is in position 2 (which is allowed, because previously it was in 3 and wrong).
N is in position 3 (allowed, because previously it was in 4 and wrong).
E is in position 5 (but we know from the first guess that E is not in position 5? So we cannot put E in position 5 again? Because the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5. So if we put E in position 5 again, it would be the same mistake.

Therefore, we must avoid putting E in position 5. Similarly, we must avoid putting A in position 3 and N in position 4.

So in ""MANGE"", E is in position 5, which is not allowed (because we know E is not in position 5). So we cannot use that.

We need a word that has E in a position other than 5.

Let me try ""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> positions: A in 2, E in 4, N in 5.

But note: we cannot put N in position 4? Actually, in the first guess N was in position 4 and it was wrong. But in this word, N is in position 5? That's allowed because we haven't tried N in position 5 before? Actually, we only know that N is not in position 4. So position 5 is new.

Similarly, E is in position 4? We know E is not in position 5, but position 4 is new for E.

A is in position 2? We know A is not in position 3, but position 2 is new.

So ""HAVEN"" has:
- A in position 2 (new)
- E in position 4 (new)
- N in position 5 (new for N? But note: we haven't tried N in position 5, but we have tried E in position 5 and it was wrong, but that doesn't affect N).

But also, we have H and V as new letters.

Is ""HAVEN"" a valid word? Yes.

But note: the word must be 5 letters and English.

Another option: ""LEANS"" -> L, E, A, N, S -> positions: E in 2, A in 3, N in 4, S in 5.

But we cannot put A in position 3 (we know it's wrong) and N in position 4 (also wrong). So that's not allowed.

Another: ""SENNA"" -> S, E, N, N, A -> but has duplicate N? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the rules don't forbid. However, we have to be cautious. Also, A is in position 5? That's allowed. But we have two N's? We don't know if the secret word has two N's? But we know N is in the word, but maybe only once? We don't know.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to keep it simple.

Another word: ""ADIEU"" -> but it doesn't have N? We need to include N because we know it's in the word.

We must include A, N, E.

So let's try to find a word that has A, N, E and two other letters (not C or R) and positions for A, N, E that are not the ones we know are wrong.

We can try:

- Position 1: A? Then we have A at start.
- Position 2: E? 
- Position 3: N? But we know A is not in 3, but N can be in 3? Yes, because we only know N is not in 4.

But we have to form a word.

Word: ""ANODE"" -> A, N, O, D, E -> positions: A(1), N(2), O(3), D(4), E(5)

But E is in position 5? We know E is not in position 5. So we cannot use that.

Word: ""ALINE"" -> A, L, I, N, E -> positions: A(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), E(5)

But N is in position 4? We know N is not in position 4. And E is in position 5? Also not allowed.

Word: ""AMEND"" -> A, M, E, N, D -> positions: A(1), M(2), E(3), N(4), D(5)

But N is in position 4? Not allowed.

Word: ""EATEN"" -> E, A, T, E, N -> duplicate E? And E in position 1? That's allowed. A in position 2? Allowed. T in 3? E in 4? But we have two E's? And N in 5? We know E is not in position 5? But here N is in 5, which is allowed? But we have E in position 1 and 4? We don't know if the word has two E's? But we only know that E is in the word (at least one). So it might have two.

But let's see: ""EATEN"" has E in position 1 and 4? And we know E is not in position 5, but we don't know about other positions. However, we are trying to avoid the known wrong positions: for E we avoid 5, for A avoid 3, for N avoid 4.

In ""EATEN"":
- E is in 1 and 4 -> both are new (we haven't tried E in 1 or 4) -> so allowed.
- A is in 2 -> new (we only tried in 3) -> allowed.
- N is in 5 -> new (we only tried in 4) -> allowed.

But we have two E's? That might be acceptable.

But we are introducing T as a new letter.

Alternatively, we can try ""NEVER"" but that has R? We cannot use R.

Another word: ""MEANT"" -> M, E, A, N, T -> positions: E in 2? A in 3? But we cannot put A in 3. So no.

Word: ""LEANT"" we already considered and it has A in 3 and N in 4, which are not allowed.

Word: ""PANEL"" -> P, A, N, E, L -> positions: A in 2? (allowed, because we only know A is not in 3), N in 3? (allowed, because we only know N is not in 4), E in 4? (allowed, because we only know E is not in 5). And L in 5.

So ""PANEL"" has:
- P (new)
- A in 2 (new position for A)
- N in 3 (new position for N)
- E in 4 (new position for E)
- L (new)

And no C or R.

This seems valid.

Another option: ""LATEN"" -> but is that a word? I think ""laten"" is not common. Let me think of common words.

""PANEL"" is a common word.

We can also consider ""SALET"" or ""TALON"", but ""TALON"" has O and N in 5? But we need E? We must include E.

We must include A, N, E.

So ""PANEL"" is a good candidate.

Another candidate: ""ANEWS"" -> not a word.

""WANED"": W, A, N, E, D -> positions: A in 2, N in 3, E in 4, D in 5. This is similar to ""PANEL"" but with W and D.

But ""WANED"" is a word.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider ""AGENT"": A, G, E, N, T -> positions: A(1), G(2), E(3), N(4), T(5)

But N is in position 4? We know N is not in position 4. So we cannot use that.

""AGENT"" is invalid because of N in 4.

""AMENT"" -> not a word.

""OAKEN"": O, A, K, E, N -> positions: A in 2, E in 4, N in 5 -> that works? A in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), N in 5 (allowed). And O and K are new.

But ""oaken"" is a word.

So we have multiple options: ""HAVEN"", ""PANEL"", ""WANED"", ""OAKEN"", etc.

We want to maximize information. We should try to include common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as S, T, L, D, etc.

In ""crane"", we tested C, R, A, N, E. So we know A, N, E are present and C, R are absent.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover more common consonants.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.

In ""PANEL"", we are testing P, L and also A, N, E in new positions.

In ""HAVEN"", we test H, V.

In ""WANED"", we test W, D.

In ""OAKEN"", we test O, K.

I think ""PANEL"" is a good choice because it tests P and L, which are common.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" but we don't have N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we cannot omit N.

We must include A, N, E.

So I think ""PANEL"" is a solid choice.

Let me confirm the positions in ""PANEL"":
- P: position 1 (new letter, new position)
- A: position 2 (we know A is in the word, but not in position 3; now we try position 2)
- N: position 3 (we know N is in the word, but not in position 4; now we try position 3)
- E: position 4 (we know E is in the word, but not in position 5; now we try position 4)
- L: position 5 (new letter)

This should be acceptable.

So I will guess ""PANEL"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: absent, R: absent, A: present but wrong position, N: present but wrong position, E: present but wrong position), the following is deduced:
- The secret word contains A, N, and E, but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively (since in ""crane"", A was in position 3, N in 4, and E in 5, and they were marked as wrong positions).
- The letters C and R are absent from the secret word entirely.
- The new guess must include A, N, and E in positions other than the ones previously tried (i.e., A not in position 3, N not in position 4, E not in position 5) and avoid using C or R.
- To maximize information, the guess should introduce new common letters (e.g., P, L) and test A, N, E in new positions.

The word ""panel"" is chosen because:
- It includes A (position 2), N (position 3), and E (position 4), all in new positions that comply with the feedback.
- It introduces two new letters: P (position 1) and L (position 5), which are common consonants not yet tested.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.

<guess>panel</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
  Meaning:
    C: absent
    R: absent
    A: present but wrong position (and since it was in position 3, the correct position isn't 3)
    N: present but wrong position (position 4 is wrong)
    E: present but wrong position (position 5 is wrong)

Guess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(-)
  Meaning:
    P: absent
    A: present but wrong position (in panel, A was in position 2 -> so position 2 is not correct for A)
    N: present but wrong position (in panel, N was in position 3 -> so position 3 is not correct for N)
    E: present but wrong position (in panel, E was in position 4 -> so position 4 is not correct for E)
    L: present but wrong position (in panel, L was in position 5 -> so position 5 is not correct for L)

Now, we know the secret word:
- Contains A, N, E, L (because they are marked present in both guesses) and does not contain C, R, P.
- We have two new pieces of information: 
  - L is present (from guess 2), and it's not in position 5.

Also, from the positions:
For A: wrong in position 3 (from guess 1) and wrong in position 2 (from guess 2). So A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
Similarly:
  For N: wrong in position 4 (guess 1) and wrong in position 3 (guess 2). So N cannot be in positions 3 or 4.
  For E: wrong in position 5 (guess 1) and wrong in position 4 (guess 2). So E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
  For L: wrong in position 5 (guess 2). We have only tried L in position 5, so it cannot be in 5, but could be in 1,2,3,4.

Moreover, since the word has 5 letters and we know A, N, E, L must be in it, that accounts for 4 letters. The fifth letter is unknown (but not C, R, or P).

Possible positions for A: positions 1, 4, 5? But note: we haven't tried position 1 or 4 for A? Actually, we tried A in 3 and 2, so positions 1,4,5 are still possible? But wait, the word must have A and it must be in one of the positions we haven't tried? But we have tried position 2 and 3. So only 1,4,5? But in a 5-letter word, positions are 1 to 5.

Similarly, for N: we tried in 4 (guess1) and 3 (guess2). So N cannot be in 3 or 4 -> available positions 1,2,5.
For E: tried in 5 (guess1) and 4 (guess2) -> cannot be in 4 or 5 -> available positions 1,2,3.
For L: tried only in 5 -> cannot be in 5 -> available positions 1,2,3,4.

Now, we need to assign the letters A, N, E, L to positions 1 to 5 without using the forbidden positions for each, and we have one more letter to assign to the remaining position.

We also know that the fifth letter must be a letter not yet tried (or that hasn't been ruled out) and not C, R, P.

But note: we have only 4 letters: A, N, E, L. The word has 5 letters, so there must be a fifth letter. We don't know it yet.

The secret word has exactly 5 letters. We know it contains A, N, E, L and one more letter.

We must include a fifth letter that hasn't been guessed? We have tested only C, R, P (absent) and A, N, E, L (present). So the fifth letter could be any other letter of the alphabet.

We need to form a word that fits these constraints.

Let me try to list possible positions for each:

- A: must be in 1,4,5 (since not 2 or 3)
- N: must be in 1,2,5 (since not 3 or 4)
- E: must be in 1,2,3 (since not 4 or 5)
- L: must be in 1,2,3,4 (since not 5)

We also have a fifth letter (say X) that goes in the remaining position.

We must assign one letter per position.

Also, note that a letter cannot be in two positions at once? Except if duplicates? But we haven't been told that there are duplicates, but we must consider? The feedback doesn't show duplicates? Actually, in feedback, each letter is marked separately, so if a letter appears twice, both would be marked? But we don't have any duplicates in the guesses so far, so we can't assume duplicates.

We'll assume no duplicates for now?

But let's see: we have 5 positions and 5 distinct letters: A, N, E, L, and X.

We need to assign A, N, E, L to 4 positions and X to the fifth.

But we cannot assign two letters to one position.

So we must allocate the positions without overlap.

Moreover, the fifth letter X must be in a position that is available? Actually, we don't restrict X? X can be in any position? But we have to form a word.

Let's try to see if we can find a word that fits.

First, note that E must be in 1,2, or 3.

A must be in 1,4, or 5.

But if A is in 1, then position 1 is taken by A, so E cannot be in 1? So they might conflict.

Similarly, N must be in 1,2,5.

L must be in 1,2,3,4.

We have five positions, we need to assign letters to each.

We can consider the possibilities for position 1.

Position 1: could be A, N, E, L, or X? But let's see:

Since E cannot be in 4 or 5, position 1 is available for E? Yes.

Similarly, A, N, L can be in position 1.

But let's list the possible assignments for the known letters:

We can try to assign A, N, E, L to four positions and leave one for X.

But we don't know X.

Alternatively, we can try to find a word that includes A, N, E, L and one more letter, with the position constraints.

Let me think of common English words containing A, N, E, L.

Possible words: ""LANE"" but it's 4 letters. Need 5.

Adding a letter: ""LEARN"" but R is absent? Can't use R.

""LEANT"" -> has T, but we tried L in position 5? Wait, no: ""LEANT"" is L,E,A,N,T.

But in our position constraints:

L: ? we haven't assigned, but in ""LEANT"", L is in position 1 -> allowed (we only know L not in 5).
E is in position 2 -> allowed (E must be in 1,2,3).
A is in position 3? But we know A cannot be in position 3. So A is in 3? Forbidden. So not.

""ALIEN"" -> A,L,I,E,N.

Positions:
A in 1? -> allowed (since we haven't tried A in 1? Yes, and it's not forbidden).
L in 2? -> allowed (we only know L not in 5; 2 is okay).
I in 3? -> new letter.
E in 4? -> but E cannot be in 4! Because from feedback E is not allowed in position 4 (from guess2). So E in 4 is forbidden.

So ""ALIEN"": E in 4 -> forbidden.

""ALONE"" -> but O, and E in 4? Not allowed.

""ANILE"" -> A,N,I,L,E -> positions: A(1), N(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). But E in 5? Forbidden! Because E cannot be in 5.

""ELAND"" -> E,L,A,N,D.

Position 1: E? -> E in 1? Allowed? Yes, because E can be in 1,2,3.
Then L in 2? -> allowed.
A in 3? -> forbidden! A cannot be in 3.
So no.

We have to avoid A in positions 2 and 3? So only 1,4,5?

And E in 1,2,3? So if A is in position 1, then E cannot be in position 1? So A and E can't both be in position 1? So if A is in 1, then E must be in 2 or 3.

Similarly, N in 1,2,5? If A is in 1, then N can be in 2 or 5.

L in any but 5.

Let's try:

Option: A in position 1:
  Then:
    Position 1: A
    Then E must be in 2 or 3.
    N must be in 2 or 5? But position 2: if E is there, then N in 5? And L in 3 or 4? And the fifth letter in the other position.

  Example word? ""ANLE?"" No.

  Let me try: If A in 1, E in 2: then positions 1-A, 2-E.
    Then position 2 is E -> no problem?
    Then we need N and L and one more letter.

    Then position 3: must be L or N? But N cannot be in position 3? Only 1,2,5? But 1 is taken, 2 taken, so N must be in 5? So N in 5? Then L can be in 3 or 4? And position 4 and 3: one for L and one for the fifth letter.

    For example, word: ""A E _ _ N"" -> say ""A E L X N"" but then E is in 2? Then L in 3? Then X in 4? Then N in 5? But L in 3? Allowed? And N in 5? Also allowed? We haven't tried N in 5? But we know N can be in 5? Yes.

    E in 2: allowed? Yes, because E rejected only from 4 and 5? So 2 is okay.

    What words of the form A E L ? N: ""ae_L_N""? Not a word? ""AELXN"" doesn't work.

    With A in 1, E in 2, N in 5: then we need L and X in positions 3 and 4.

    Words: ""AXELN""? Not a word.

    Is ""AGLEN"" a word? No.

    Perhaps ""AVEL N""? Not 5 letters.

    Or ""A E X L N"" -> I can think of ""EXAM"" but not.

Another possibility: A in 1, E in 3? Then:
  Positions: 1-A, 3-E
  E in 3: allowed? Yes, because E can be in 1,2,3? So 3 is okay.
  Then N must be in 2 or 5? Because positions available: 2,4,5? But N can be in 1,2,5? But 1 taken? So 2 or 5.
  L can be in 2,4? But 2 might be taken? Also, position 4 and 5? And the fifth letter.

Case: N in position 2? Then we have A(1), N(2), E(3), then positions 4 and 5: L and fifth letter? But L cannot be in 5? So L must be in 4? And fifth letter in 5? Then the word is ""A N E L X"" -> ""ANELX""? Not a word.

Case: N in position 5? Then we have A(1), ?, E(3), ?, N(5). So positions 2 and 4: for L and X? L can be in 4? Then X in 2? Or L in 2? So word: ""A X E L N"" -> ""AXELN"" not a word? Or ""A L E X N"" -> ""ALEXN"" not a word? ""ALIEN"" we tried already? But E is in 3? And if we put L in 2, X in 4? ""ALEXN"" is not a word? Or ""ALEFN"" no. 

Alternatively, we can try A in position 4 or 5.

Try A in position 4?
Then: 
  A in 4: that is allowed? Because we know A not in 2 or 3? So position 4 is new.
  Now, we need to assign E, N, L.
  E must be in 1,2,3? 
  N must be in 1,2,5?
  L must be in 1,2,3,4? But 4 is taken by A? So L in 1,2,3?

  So for E: 1,2,3? 
  Let me put E in position 1? Then we have position 1: E? Allowed? Yes.
  Then N in 2 or 5? 
  L in 3? Or 2? 
  And fifth letter in the other.

  Example: E in 1, then N in 2? Then L in 3? Then A in 4? Then position 5: fifth letter? So word: ""E N L A X"" -> ""ENLAX"" not a word? Or ""E N L A ?"" 

  Or put E in 1, then N in 5? Then word: E ? ? A N? Then we need L? In positions 2 or 3? And X in the other? So ""E X1 X2 A N"" -> and L must be in 2 or 3? So for example: ""E L ? A N""? But we need a letter in position 3? ""EL*AN"" -> like ""ELPAN"" but P is out? Or ""ELVAN"" ? ""ELVAN"" is not a word? Or ""ELDAN""? Not English.

  ""OLEAN"" but O is a letter? And we have A in 4? But O in 1? But we have E in 1? Not.

Try E in 2? Then position 2: E? A in position 4? Then N in 1 or 5? L in 3? Or what? Position 1? Must be filled by N or L? Etc.

It's getting messy. Let me try A in position 5?
Then we have A at the end? And we know A cannot be in 2 or 3? So position 5 is new? And A can be there? From the constraints? Yes.
Then:
  Position 5: A.
  Then E must be in 1,2,3? 
  N in 1,2,5? But 5 taken? So N in 1 or 2?
  L in 1,2,3,4? But 4 available?
  Fifth letter in some position.

So example: N in 1? Then E in 2 or 3? 
Then L in 3 or 4? 
Fifth letter in the remaining position.

Word: ""N E ? ? A""? Or ""N E L ? A""? 

For example: ""N E L X A"" -> ""NELXA""? No? Or ""NELLA"" but has double L? And A is in position 5? ""NELLA"" is a proper name? Or not a common word.

Another one: ""BALED"" -> but we tried? B is new? ""BALED"": B,A,L,E,D -> A in 2? But A cannot be in position 2? Because in guess2 we tried A in position 2 and it was wrong position? So A must not be in 2.

So if we put A in 5, we avoid position 2 and 3? So okay.

What are common words with A at the end? 

Like ""ULTRA"" but U,L,T,R,A -> R is absent? Cannot use R.

""MANGA"" -> M,A,N,G,A -> duplicate A? And A in positions 2 and 5? But A in 2 is forbidden? We know A must not be in 2? So ""MANGA"" has A in 2? Not allowed.

""ARENA"" -> A in 1? But also in 4? A in 1 is allowed, but we have R which is absent? And A in 1: then E in the word? Etc. Not allowed.

Back to the constraints: include A, N, E, L and one more, with positions:

Maybe we should try a word where L is in position 1? Then A in 4 or 5? Etc.

But let me list all the forbidden positions we know:

- A: cannot be in 2 or 3
- N: cannot in 3 or 4
- E: cannot in 4 or 5
- L: cannot in 5

Available positions by letter:
A: 1,4,5
N: 1,2,5
E: 1,2,3
L: 1,2,3,4

And we have to assign these letters to exactly one position each? Because no duplicates? And then assign X to the last.

But we have 5 positions and 5 letters.

So we must have one position for each: A, N, E, L, and X.

Let me try to make a position assignment.

Try position 1: which letter can go? E? Then:
  Position 1: E (allowed)
  Then for position 2: who can go? A, N, L (because E is taken)
    Try A: not allowed in 2? So no.
    Try N: allowed? Yes, because N can be in 1,2,5? But 1 taken? So 2 allowed? Yes.
      Then position 2: N. 
      Then position 3: who? A, L (E taken, N taken) -> A cannot be in 3? So only L. L in position 3? Allowed? Yes.
        Then positions 4 and 5: for A and X? But A must be in 4 or 5? 
        Also, position 4: if A is there, then position 4: A? Allowed? Yes.
        Then position 5: X? But E cannot be in 5? That's for E? But this is X? So okay. But L cannot be in 5? But we have L in 3? Safe.

        And X in 5? but we don't know what letter. So the word: E, N, L, A, X? Positions 1: E, 2: N, 3: L, 4: A, 5: X.

        This fits: ""E N L A X"" -> but not a word? We can try to find an English word ending like this? Sounds like ""EN X A"" not.

        Or if we swap: position 4: X, position 5: A? Then word: ""E N L X A"" -> ""X"" in 4, ""A"" in 5. But what words are like that? ""ENOBA"" or something? Not common.

    After position 2 being N, for position 3, if we don't put L, then only X? But then where to put L? We haven't assigned L? Then L must be in position 4? Because it cannot be in 5? So ""E, N, X, L, A""? Word: ""ENXLA""? Not a word.

Try position 1: L? 
  Then:
    Position 1: L (allowed)
    Then position 2: available for A, N, E? 
      A: cannot in 2? So no.
      N: allowed in 2? Yes.
        Then position 2: N.
        Then position 3: available for E (since A cannot be in 3, but E can be in 3) -> so E in 3? Allowed? Yes.
          Then positions 4 and 5: for A and X? But A must be in 4 or 5? 
          Position 4: A? Allowed? Yes.
          Position 5: X? Allowed? But L cannot be in 5, but this is X? So okay.

          Word: L, N, E, A, X? or ""L,N,E,X,A"" -> positions 1:L, 2:N, 3:E, 4:A, 5:X -> word ""LNEAX""? Not a word.

          Or position 4: X? position 5: A? -> ""L,N,E,X,A"" -> ""LNEXA"" not a word.

      Or for position 2: if we put E? Allowed? Yes, position 2: E? Then:
        Then position 2: E.
        Then position 3: Cannot be A? So only N or L or X? But N cannot be in 3? So L or X? Try L: position 3: L? Not forbidden? L in 3 is allowed.
          Then position 4 and 5: for A and X? A must be in 4 or 5? 
          If A in 4? A in position 4: allowed? Yes.
          Position 5: X? Then word: ""L, E, L, A, X"" duplicate L? And ""LELAX"" not a word? And we have duplicate L? Maybe not.

          Position 4: X; position 5: A? ""L,E,L,X,A""? ""LELXA"" not a word.

        If position 3: X? then in position 4 and 5: for A and N? Because N must be in 5? (since position 4 cannot for N? and position 5 is available? N can be in 5? Then: position 4 could be A? in 4: allowed? And position 5: N? allowed? So word: ""L, E, X, A, N"" -> ""LEXAN""? Is that a word?

        ""LEXAN"" is not a common English word? Maybe not.

Now, try position 1: N? 
  Allow N in 1.
  Then position 2: can be E? (since A cannot, and N taken) -> E in 2? allowed? Yes.
    Then position 2: E.
    Then position 3: can be L? (A cannot, E and N taken) -> L in 3? allowed? Then:
        Positions 4 and 5: for A and X? 
        A cannot be in 2 or 3, so could be 4 or 5? 
        If A in 4? Then X in 5: word as ""N E L A X"" -> NELAX not word.
        If A in 5? Then X in 4: ""N E L X A""-> NELXA not word.

    Or position 3: X? then positions 4 and 5: for A and L? But L must be assigned? L cannot be in 5? So L must be in 4? then A in 5? -> ""N E X L A"" -> NEXLA not word? 

We are struggling to find a word. Maybe there's a duplicate letter.

Or perhaps we missed a common word.

Another idea: fifth letter might be 'S'? of 'T'? etc.

Let me recall that in panel, we got feedback that A, N, E, L are present! So the word at this point must have exactly A, N, E, L and one more letter.

Common words: ""ELAND"" -> E, L, A, N, D -> E in 1, L in 2, A in 3? But A in 3 is forbidden.

""ANLEP""? Not a word.

""LANES"" -> L, A, N, E, S -> But A in position 2? forbidden? Because in panel we had A in 2 and it was wrong position? So A cannot be in 2.

""LEASE"" -> L, E, A, S, E -> duplicate E? And A in 3? forbidden.

""CANEL"" -> C is out? Not.

""ANGEL"" -> A, N, G, E, L.
Positions: A in 1? Allowed.
 N in 2? Allowed.
 G in 3? new letter.
 E in 4? for bidden! Because E cannot be in 4.

""AN CLE"" not.

""NUTELLA"" too long.

""FLANE"" not 5.

""ELAN plus one letter?

Perhaps the fifth letter is 'D': ""ELAND"" again, but issues.

""ENDED""-> dup E? but we know E is present, so possibly dup? But let's see.

 But in ""ENDED"", positions: E(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), D(5). But E in 1: allowed. N in 2: allowed. E in 4? forbidden! Cannot.

""LANDE"" -> L, A, N, D, E -> A in 2? forbidden.

"" DEAN"" 4 letters.

""STAND"" not L.

 Another word: ""SAL	 ET"" not.

 I recall that we haven't tried the fifth letter much. We should guess a word that has A, N, E, L in positions meeting the constraints, and a new letter.

Let me try ""ANEAR"" but R is out.

""ANELE"" -> A, N, E, L, E? duplicate E? And positions: A in 1, N in 2, E in 3, L in 4, E in 5? That's only 4 unique letters, but duplicate E.

But with duplicate E: still,positions? A in 1? Allowed. N in 2? Allowed. E in 3? Allowed. L in 4? Allowed. E in 5? Forbidden! Because E cannot be in 5. So one E in 3 is allowed, but the other in 5? Not. So not.

 Perhaps.

 Maybe ""ALANE"" . ""ALANE"" is a word? and positions: A(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), E(5) -> A in 1 allowed, L in 2 allowed? But A in 3? forbidden! And E in 5 forbidden.

Alternatively, how about E in 1, W in 2, A in 4, L in 3, N in 5? but does that form a word? ""E W A L N"" -> ""EWALN"" not a word? or ""EWANL"" no.

Perhaps ""WELง"" not.

 I think we need to search systematically.

Let's go for A in position 4? and E in position 1? which we tried before.

With E in 1, A in 4, then N in 5? and L in 2 or 3? 
If L in 2: then position 3: X? -> word: ""E L X A N"" -> ""ELXAN"" not word.
If L in 3: ""E X L A N"" -> ""EXLAN"" not word.

Or with A in 5? and E in 1, then N in 1 or 2? position 1 occupied by E? So N in 2? Then position 3: X? position 4: L? then ""E N X L A"" , so ""ENXLA"" not word.

 or position 3: L? position 4: X? ""E N L X A"" - ""EN LX A"" not.

But ""ENOLA"" is a word? ""ENOLA"": E,N,O,L,A -> positions: E(1), N(2), O(3), L(4), A(5).

Let's check the constraints:
A: position 5? allowed. (since it can be in 1,4,5)
N: position 2? allowed. (since cannot be in 3 or 4, and 2 is okay)
E: position 1? allowed.
L: position 4? allowed. (since not 5)

 fifth letter O in position 3? which is new.

Also, O has not been tried? And not C,R,P.

So ""ENOLA"" is a valid English word? Enola is a name, sometimes accepted? But we need a common word.

Perhaps ""KENE L"" no.

 another word: ""MEAN L"" with M, but then ""AN M E"" etc.

""HEALD"" only 5 if we use, but not having A in 4 or 5? etc.

Actually, ""ENOLA"" might be acceptable. But let's see if there's a better choice.

Another common word: ""LATER"" but R is out.

""WALES"" -> W,A,L,E,S -> but A in 2? forbidden.

""LANES"" . A in 2? forbidden.

""LEANS"" . L(1), E(2), A(3), N(4), S(5) -> A in 3? forbidden. N in 4? forbidden. E in 2 we haven tried but in this case, A in 3 is already invalid.

 onsecond thought, we have to bite the bullet and choose a word even if it's a name. Or is there a better?

""SANEL""? not word.

""ANELE"" with E in 5.

""EL 0 A N"" with O? 'ELOAN""? ""ELOAN"" is not a word. ""E"" loan no.

What about ""Navel"" -> N,A,V,E,L -> A in 2? for forbidden! position 2? We know A cannot be in 2.

""VALEN"" -> V,A,L,E,N -> A in 2? again forbidden.

""NE A L S"" -> ""NEALS""? as in kneecap? not.

 Perhaps ""ILEAN"" not word.

Given the difficulty, maybe there's a mistake or we need to consider that the fifth letter is S.

Try ""S a e L 0"", no.

Another idea: perhaps the secret word has duplicate letters? For instance, two N's or something? But in our guesses, we haven't seen duplicate feedback, but it's possible.

For example, maybe the word is ""L E E A N"" but E in 1 and 2, and A in 4? then N in 5? etc.

Let me try: ""LEEAN"" not a word.

""AL EEN"" not.

""ENEMA"" no L.

Recall that in feedback for guess2: L was present but not in position 5? So we know L is in the word.

New strategy: we can ignore the fifth letter for a moment and focus on placing A, N, E, L in allowed positions and forming a valid wordtem.

We know:
- A not in 2,3 -> so in 1,4,5
- N not in 3,4 -> in 1,2,5
- E not in 4,5 -> in 1,2,3
- L not in 5 -> in 1,2,3,4

Choose a word that has these four letters and an additional letter, satisfying position constraints.

Use a word finder program? But we can't, so rack brains.

Common 5-letter words with A, E, L, N:

- ""LENIENT"" too long.
- ""PLANE"" -> P is out? We know P is absent.
- ""ELANE"" not.
- ""LEANT"" -> A in 3, N in 4? forbidd.
- ""N ELAL"" no.
- ""ANEL E"" no.

 I recall that ""ELAND"" is an animal. Let's re- check positions for ""ELAND"": positions 1:E, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:D. But A in 3 is forbidden, and also E in 1 is allowed, L in 2 is allowed? New? but A in 3 is not allowed. Plus, N in 4 is not allowed. So it violates.

""Д A L E N"" L in 1, A in 2 which is not allowed.

 Another word: ""A U L N E"" not.

After exhaustive search, found: Given the constraints, a word like ""KNEEL"" has two E's? then A no 'A'. Must include A.

Perhaps ""SELEN"" only 5 letters? no.

 It's taking too long.

Let's try the word ""CANE"" only 4.
 Or ""LANE"" 4.

 One word: ""OLE IN"" not.

 I think we may have to for ""ENOLA"" as a guess. It matches all constraints and is a proper name. Or ""ALONE"" only we saw earlier? Let's check ""ALONE"": positions - A(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). 

For A: position 1? allowed? Yes.
L: position 2? allowed? Yes? (not tried before? we only know L not in 5? 2 is new)
O: position 3? new.
N: position 4? forbidden! Because in first guess N was in 4 and wrong, and in second guess we for N in 3 and wrong? and position 4 for N is not allowed? from first guess: N in 4 was wrong position? so N cannot be in 4, and here it's in 4? so we cannot use.

Another word: ""ANODE"" has A in 1, N in 2, O in 3, E in 5? forbidden for E.

""ABED"" only 4.

I think for the sake of progress, let's guess ""ENOLA"". 

 Reasons:
- Meets the position constraints:
  E in 1: allowed
  N in 2: allowed
  O in 3: new letter, not tested and not forbidden.
  L in 4: allowed
  A in 5: allowed

- Contains A, N, E, L and O as fifth letter.

- O is a vowel, hasn't been tested.

- ""Enola"" is a word (proper name, but sometimes accepted in word games).

Alternatively, is there ""LEN O A"" no. 

 We have to make a guess.

So I will guess ""ENOLA"".

But note: the feedback for duplicates? But we don't have duplicates here.

So guess: ""ENOLA""

<guess>enola</guess>

But wait, let's double-check the constraints:

Secret word must contain A, N, E, L. ""ENOLA"" has E, N, O, L, A -> yes.

Positions:

E in 1? Is there any feedback that would make E in 1 forbidden? No, because we know E should be in 1,2,3.

N in 2: and we know N should not be in 3 or 4? 2 is not 3 or 4, so ok.

L in 4: and we know L should not be in 5? 4 is not 5, so ok.

A in 5: and we know A should not be in 2 or 3? 5 is not 2 or 3, so ok.

O in 3: a new letter.

So this fits all the constraints we have.

Therefore, we guess ""ENOLA"".

<guess>enola</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(-)
Guess 3: enola -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(-) O(x) L(-) A(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(absent), R(absent), A(present but wrong position), N(present but wrong position), E(present but wrong position)
2. ""panel"": P(absent), A(present but wrong position), N(present but wrong position), E(present but wrong position), L(present but wrong position)
3. ""enola"": E(present but wrong position), N(present but wrong position), O(absent), L(present but wrong position), A(present but wrong position)

From this, we know:
- The letters C, R, P, O are absent.
- The letters A, N, E, L are present (each is ""present"" in all guesses where they appeared).
- We have position constraints for A, N, E, L based on previous feedback.

Specifically, let's list the correct and forbidden positions for each letter:

**For A:**
- In ""crane"" (position 3), A was marked wrong position → so correct position is not 3.
- In ""panel"" (position 2), A was marked wrong position → not 2.
- In ""enola"" (position 5), A was marked wrong position → not 5.
- Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 4 (since positions 2,3,5 are forbidden).

**For N:**
- In ""crane"" (position 4), wrong position → not 4.
- In ""panel"" (position 3), wrong position → not 3.
- In ""enola"" (position 2), wrong position → not 2.
- Therefore, N must be in position 1 or 5 (since positions 2,3,4 are forbidden).

**For E:**
- In ""crane"" (position 5), wrong position → not 5.
- In ""panel"" (position 4), wrong position → not 4.
- In ""enola"" (position 1), wrong position → not 1.
- Therefore, E must be in position 2 or 3 (since positions 1,4,5 are forbidden).

**For L:**
- In ""panel"" (position 5), wrong position → not 5.
- In ""enola"" (position 4), wrong position → not 4.
- Therefore, L must be in position 1,2, or 3 (since positions 4 and 5 are forbidden).

We also know that the word contains exactly these four letters (A, N, E, L) and one additional letter that is not C, R, P, O. This fifth letter must be one we haven't guessed yet, and it cannot be any of the absent letters.

Now, let's consider possible consistent placements:

1. **N position:** N must be in 1 or 5.
2. **A position:** A must be in 1 or 4.
3. **E position:** E must be in 2 or 3.
4. **L position:** L must be in 1,2,3.

But note: positions must be distinct. 

**Case 1: N in position 1**
Then:
- Position 1: N
- A cannot be in 1, so A must be in 4 (since other options forbidden).
- E must be in 2 or 3.
- L must be in 2 or 3 (but cannot conflict with E).

So possible subcases:
- If E in 2, L in 3: Then positions: 1=N, 2=E, 3=L, 4=A, 5=? (fifth letter)
- If E in 3, L in 2: Then positions: 1=N, 2=L, 3=E, 4=A, 5=?

In both subcases, position 5 is the fifth letter.

**Case 2: N in position 5**
Then:
- Position 5: N
- A must be in 1 or 4.
- E must be in 2 or 3.
- L must be in 1,2,3.

If A in 1:
- Position 1: A
- Positions 2,3: for E and L? 
- E in 2 or 3, L in the other.
- For example: E in 2, L in 3 or E in 3, L in 2.
- Then position 4: fifth letter.

If A in 4:
- Position 4: A
- Position 1: then could be L (since L can be in 1) or fifth letter?
- Position 5: N, so 5 is taken.
- E must be in 2 or 3.
- L must be in 1,2,3.

Subcases:
- If L in 1: then E in 2 or 3: positions 1=L, 2=E (or E in 3), 3=? (if E in 2, then position 3 could be fifth letter; if E in 3, position 2 could be fifth letter).
- Or L in 2 or 3.

But this may be messy. Let's list possible words consistent with the feedback.

Given the constraints, we should form a guess that tests the possible placements and introduces a new letter.

Since we know the word has A, N, E, L, we can aim for a word that satisfies one of the above cases.

For example, take Case 1 with N in 1, E in 2, L in 3, A in 4: then the word would be N, E, L, A, ? for position 5. We need a fifth letter, say X, and it must be a valid English word ""NELAX"" – not a valid word.

Similarly, with N in 1, E in 3, L in 2: ""N, L, E, A, X"" → ""NLEAX"" – not valid.

Now Case 2: N in 5.
Subcase: A in 1, E in 2, L in 3: ""A, E, L, X, N"" for positions 1-5 → A E L X N. Is ""ELXN"" a word? No.

A in 1, E in 2, L in 3: word would be A, E, L, ?, N → ""A E L X N"" → e.g., ""aelxn"" not word.

But if instead of having the fifth letter in position 4, note that positions: 1=A, 2=E, 3=L, 4=?, 5=N. We need a word like ""A E L _ N"". 

What English words fit this pattern? 
- ""alien"" but we tried already? Alien has I, but not N at the end. ""Alien"" is A,L,I,E,N, which has E in 4? Not our pattern.

Pattern: positions 1:A, 2:E, 3:L, 4:?, 5:N. So ""AEL?N"". 

Examples: ""AELIN"" not word. ""AELON"" not. Perhaps ""alkin"" no.

Alternatively, subcase: A in 1, E in 3, L in 2: ""A, L, E, X, N"" → ""A L E X N"". Words: ""alexn"" not, but ""ALEX"" is 4 letters. Not.

Try possible word: In the feedback for ""enola"", L is in position 4 and marked wrong position, but in our case we are putting L in other positions.

Another pattern from Case 2 with N in 5: A in 4, then L in 1, then E in 2 or 3.

Suppose L in 1, E in 2, A in 4, N in 5: then positions 1=L, 2=E, 3=?, 4=A, 5=N. So word ""L E ? A N"".

What words? Like ""L E M A N"" (leman) which is a word, meaning a lover or sweetheart. Also, ""le""gan"" etc.

""LEMAN"" is a valid English word! Let's check constraints:

- Positions: L(1), E(2), M(3), A(4), N(5)

Check against feedback:
- L: in position 1 – we have not tried L in 1 before? And our constraints say L can be in 1? Yes, since L not in 4 or 5.
- E: in position 2 – E must be in 2 or 3? Yes.
- A: in position 4 – A can be in 1 or 4? Yes.
- N: in position 5 – N can be in 1 or 5? Yes.

New letter M, which hasn't been guessed, so not known to be absent.

Additionally, M is not C, R, P, O, so allowed.

Moreover, in previous guesses: 
- ""crane"" tested C,R,A,N,E – M not tested.
- ""panel"" tested P,A,N,E,L – M not tested.
- ""enola"" tested E,N,O,L,A – O tested and absent, M not tested.

So ""LEMAN"" should be a good guess.

Confirm the word: L E M A N.

Now, let's see if it fits all feedback:

- No known absent letters: C, R, P, O are absent, but M is new.
- Positions: L is in 1 (not 4 or 5), E in 2 (not 1,4,5), A in 4 (not 2,3,5), N in 5 (not 2,3,4).

Also, the fifth letter M in position 3.

This satisfies all known information.

Therefore, we guess ""LEMAN"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, R are absent; A, N, E are present but in wrong positions (not 3, 4, or 5 respectively).
- **Guess 2 (""panel"")**: P is absent; A, N, E, L are present but in wrong positions (A not 2, N not 3, E not 4, L not 5).
- **Guess 3 (""enola"")**: O is absent; E, N, L, A are present but in wrong positions (E not 1, N not 2, L not 4, A not 5).

### Analysis:
1. **Absent letters**: C, R, P, O are confirmed absent. All other letters not ruled out are possible.
2. **Present letters**: A, N, E, L are in the word but must be placed in positions consistent with feedback:
   - **A**: Must not be in positions 2, 3, or 5 → Allowed positions: 1 or 4.
   - **N**: Must not be in positions 2, 3, or 4 → Allowed positions: 1 or 5.
   - **E**: Must not be in positions 1, 4, or 5 → Allowed positions: 2 or 3.
   - **L**: Must not be in positions 4 or 5 → Allowed positions: 1, 2, or 3.
3. **Word composition**: The secret word consists of A, N, E, L, and one unknown letter (excluding C, R, P, O). This unknown letter must be new.
4. **Possible configurations**: Considering constraints:
   - If N is in position 1 (allowed), A must be in position 4 (since A cannot be in 1 if N is there). E must be in 2 or 3, L in the remaining position of 2 or 3, leaving position 5 for the fifth letter → Leads to invalid word patterns (e.g., ""NELAX"").
   - If N is in position 5 (allowed), A could be in 1 or 4:
     - If A in position 1, E and L must be in positions 2 and 3 → Leaves position 4 for the fifth letter. Words like ""AELXN"" are invalid.
     - If A in position 4, L could be in position 1 → Leaves E in 2 or 3 and position 3 or 2 for the fifth letter. This yields ""L E ? A N"". A valid English word fitting this pattern is ""LEMAN"" (L in position 1, E in 2, fifth letter M in 3, A in 4, N in 5).

""LEMAN"" satisfies all feedback:
- L (position 1) → Not tried before; no conflict since L cannot be in 4/5.
- E (position 2) → Allowed (E must be in 2/3).
- M (new letter) → Not ruled out (not C, R, P, O).
- A (position 4) → Allowed (A must be in 1/4).
- N (position 5) → Allowed (not in 2/3/4).

This guess tests M as the fifth unknown letter and checks all position constraints efficiently.

However, in this feedback, we don\'t have any duplicate letters in ""crane"", so we don\'t know about duplicates. But we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters?

However, we should be cautious.\n\nGiven that A, N, E are in the word, and we have two more letters to find.\n\nWe also know that the word does not have C or R.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have A, N, E and two other letters that are not C or R.\n\nWe can try to put A, N, E in positions that are not 3, 4, 5? Actually, we can try any position except the ones we know are wrong? But note: we don\'t know the correct positions yet.\n\nWe have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for these letters? Actually, the feedback for A says it is in the word but not in position 3. Similarly, N is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.\n\nSo in the new guess, we can try:\n- A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5? But note: we have to form a valid word.\n- Similarly for N and E.\n\nWe also have two new letters to include.\n\nWe should try to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.\n\nBut we also want to test the positions for A, N, E.\n\nLet me try to think of a word that has A, N, E and two new consonants (since vowels are A and E, we might need more consonants).\n\nCommon letters: we can try to use S, T, L, etc.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid C and R.\n\nLet me think of words that contain A, N, E and two other letters (not C or R).\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""SAINT"": has S, A, I, N, T -> but note: we have A, N, and E? No, it doesn\'t have E. So not.\n\n- ""SANE"": but that\'s 4 letters. We need 5.\n\n- ""LEARN"": but L, E, A, R, N -> but R is not allowed (we know R is absent). So we cannot use R.\n\n- ""LEANT"": L, E, A, N, T -> this has E, A, N, and T and L. And no C or R.\n\nBut note: in ""leant"", the positions are:\nL (1), E (2), A (3), N (4), T (5)\n\nBut in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting A in position 3 again? That would be the same position. We know A is not in position 3, so we should avoid that.\n\nSo we cannot put A in position 3 again.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot put N in position 4 (because in ""crane"" it was in 4 and was wrong) and E in position 5 (same reason).\n\nSo in ""leant"", if we put A in 3 (which we know is wrong) and N in 4 (also wrong) and E in 2? But E in 2 is a new position.\n\nBut we cannot use the same position for A and N that we know are wrong.\n\nSo we need a word that has A, N, E but in positions that are not the ones we tried? Specifically, for A: avoid position 3; for N: avoid position 4; for E: avoid position 5.\n\nSo for A: we can try positions 1, 2, 4, 5.\nFor N: positions 1, 2, 3, 5.\nFor E: positions 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nWe also have two more letters to include.\n\nLet me try to form a word:\n\nOption: ""ANVIL"" -> but it doesn\'t have E or N? It has A, N, V, I, L -> no E.\n\nWe need E.\n\nOption: ""MANGE"" -> M, A, N, G, E -> but let\'s see positions:\nM(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), E(5)\n\nNow, A is in position 2 (which is allowed, because previously it was in 3 and wrong).\nN is in position 3 (allowed, because previously it was in 4 and wrong).\nE is in position 5 (but we know from the first guess that E is not in position 5? So we cannot put E in position 5 again? Because the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5. So if we put E in position 5 again, it would be the same mistake.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid putting E in position 5. Similarly, we must avoid putting A in position 3 and N in position 4.\n\nSo in ""MANGE"", E is in position 5, which is not allowed (because we know E is not in position 5). So we cannot use that.\n\nWe need a word that has E in a position other than 5.\n\nLet me try ""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> positions: A in 2, E in 4, N in 5.\n\nBut note: we cannot put N in position 4? Actually, in the first guess N was in position 4 and it was wrong. But in this word, N is in position 5? That\'s allowed because we haven\'t tried N in position 5 before? Actually, we only know that N is not in position 4. So position 5 is new.\n\nSimilarly, E is in position 4? We know E is not in position 5, but position 4 is new for E.\n\nA is in position 2? We know A is not in position 3, but position 2 is new.\n\nSo ""HAVEN"" has:\n- A in position 2 (new)\n- E in position 4 (new)\n- N in position 5 (new for N? But note: we haven\'t tried N in position 5, but we have tried E in position 5 and it was wrong, but that doesn\'t affect N).\n\nBut also, we have H and V as new letters.\n\nIs ""HAVEN"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nBut note: the word must be 5 letters and English.\n\nAnother option: ""LEANS"" -> L, E, A, N, S -> positions: E in 2, A in 3, N in 4, S in 5.\n\nBut we cannot put A in position 3 (we know it\'s wrong) and N in position 4 (also wrong). So that\'s not allowed.\n\nAnother: ""SENNA"" -> S, E, N, N, A -> but has duplicate N? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But the rules don\'t forbid. However, we have to be cautious. Also, A is in position 5? That\'s allowed. But we have two N\'s? We don\'t know if the secret word has two N\'s? But we know N is in the word, but maybe only once? We don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates for now to keep it simple.\n\nAnother word: ""ADIEU"" -> but it doesn\'t have N? We need to include N because we know it\'s in the word.\n\nWe must include A, N, E.\n\nSo let\'s try to find a word that has A, N, E and two other letters (not C or R) and positions for A, N, E that are not the ones we know are wrong.\n\nWe can try:\n\n- Position 1: A? Then we have A at start.\n- Position 2: E? \n- Position 3: N? But we know A is not in 3, but N can be in 3? Yes, because we only know N is not in 4.\n\nBut we have to form a word.\n\nWord: ""ANODE"" -> A, N, O, D, E -> positions: A(1), N(2), O(3), D(4), E(5)\n\nBut E is in position 5? We know E is not in position 5. So we cannot use that.\n\nWord: ""ALINE"" -> A, L, I, N, E -> positions: A(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), E(5)\n\nBut N is in position 4? We know N is not in position 4. And E is in position 5? Also not allowed.\n\nWord: ""AMEND"" -> A, M, E, N, D -> positions: A(1), M(2), E(3), N(4), D(5)\n\nBut N is in position 4? Not allowed.\n\nWord: ""EATEN"" -> E, A, T, E, N -> duplicate E? And E in position 1? That\'s allowed. A in position 2? Allowed. T in 3? E in 4? But we have two E\'s? And N in 5? We know E is not in position 5? But here N is in 5, which is allowed? But we have E in position 1 and 4? We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? But we only know that E is in the word (at least one). So it might have two.\n\nBut let\'s see: ""EATEN"" has E in position 1 and 4? And we know E is not in position 5, but we don\'t know about other positions. However, we are trying to avoid the known wrong positions: for E we avoid 5, for A avoid 3, for N avoid 4.\n\nIn ""EATEN"":\n- E is in 1 and 4 -> both are new (we haven\'t tried E in 1 or 4) -> so allowed.\n- A is in 2 -> new (we only tried in 3) -> allowed.\n- N is in 5 -> new (we only tried in 4) -> allowed.\n\nBut we have two E\'s? That might be acceptable.\n\nBut we are introducing T as a new letter.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""NEVER"" but that has R? We cannot use R.\n\nAnother word: ""MEANT"" -> M, E, A, N, T -> positions: E in 2? A in 3? But we cannot put A in 3. So no.\n\nWord: ""LEANT"" we already considered and it has A in 3 and N in 4, which are not allowed.\n\nWord: ""PANEL"" -> P, A, N, E, L -> positions: A in 2? (allowed, because we only know A is not in 3), N in 3? (allowed, because we only know N is not in 4), E in 4? (allowed, because we only know E is not in 5). And L in 5.\n\nSo ""PANEL"" has:\n- P (new)\n- A in 2 (new position for A)\n- N in 3 (new position for N)\n- E in 4 (new position for E)\n- L (new)\n\nAnd no C or R.\n\nThis seems valid.\n\nAnother option: ""LATEN"" -> but is that a word? I think ""laten"" is not common. Let me think of common words.\n\n""PANEL"" is a common word.\n\nWe can also consider ""SALET"" or ""TALON"", but ""TALON"" has O and N in 5? But we need E? We must include E.\n\nWe must include A, N, E.\n\nSo ""PANEL"" is a good candidate.\n\nAnother candidate: ""ANEWS"" -> not a word.\n\n""WANED"": W, A, N, E, D -> positions: A in 2, N in 3, E in 4, D in 5. This is similar to ""PANEL"" but with W and D.\n\nBut ""WANED"" is a word.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe can also consider ""AGENT"": A, G, E, N, T -> positions: A(1), G(2), E(3), N(4), T(5)\n\nBut N is in position 4? We know N is not in position 4. So we cannot use that.\n\n""AGENT"" is invalid because of N in 4.\n\n""AMENT"" -> not a word.\n\n""OAKEN"": O, A, K, E, N -> positions: A in 2, E in 4, N in 5 -> that works? A in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), N in 5 (allowed). And O and K are new.\n\nBut ""oaken"" is a word.\n\nSo we have multiple options: ""HAVEN"", ""PANEL"", ""WANED"", ""OAKEN"", etc.\n\nWe want to maximize information. We should try to include common letters that we haven\'t tested yet, such as S, T, L, D, etc.\n\nIn ""crane"", we tested C, R, A, N, E. So we know A, N, E are present and C, R are absent.\n\nWe haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe should try to cover more common consonants.\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.\n\nIn ""PANEL"", we are testing P, L and also A, N, E in new positions.\n\nIn ""HAVEN"", we test H, V.\n\nIn ""WANED"", we test W, D.\n\nIn ""OAKEN"", we test O, K.\n\nI think ""PANEL"" is a good choice because it tests P and L, which are common.\n\nAlternatively, ""SLATE"" but we don\'t have N? We must include N because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot omit N.\n\nWe must include A, N, E.\n\nSo I think ""PANEL"" is a solid choice.\n\nLet me confirm the positions in ""PANEL"":\n- P: position 1 (new letter, new position)\n- A: position 2 (we know A is in the word, but not in position 3; now we try position 2)\n- N: position 3 (we know N is in the word, but not in position 4; now we try position 3)\n- E: position 4 (we know E is in the word, but not in position 5; now we try position 4)\n- L: position 5 (new letter)\n\nThis should be acceptable.\n\nSo I will guess ""PANEL"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: absent, R: absent, A: present but wrong position, N: present but wrong position, E: present but wrong position), the following is deduced:\n- The secret word contains A, N, and E, but not in positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively (since in ""crane"", A was in position 3, N in 4, and E in 5, and they were marked as wrong positions).\n- The letters C and R are absent from the secret word entirely.\n- The new guess must include A, N, and E in positions other than the ones previously tried (i.e., A not in position 3, N not in position 4, E not in position 5) and avoid using C or R.\n- To maximize information, the guess should introduce new common letters (e.g., P, L) and test A, N, E in new positions.\n\nThe word ""panel"" is chosen because:\n- It includes A (position 2), N (position 3), and E (position 4), all in new positions that comply with the feedback.\n- It introduces two new letters: P (position 1) and L (position 5), which are common consonants not yet tested.\n- It is a valid 5-letter English word.\n\n<guess>panel</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)\n  Meaning:\n    C: absent\n    R: absent\n    A: present but wrong position (and since it was in position 3, the correct position isn\'t 3)\n    N: present but wrong position (position 4 is wrong)\n    E: present but wrong position (position 5 is wrong)\n\nGuess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(-)\n  Meaning:\n    P: absent\n    A: present but wrong position (in panel, A was in position 2 -> so position 2 is not correct for A)\n    N: present but wrong position (in panel, N was in position 3 -> so position 3 is not correct for N)\n    E: present but wrong position (in panel, E was in position 4 -> so position 4 is not correct for E)\n    L: present but wrong position (in panel, L was in position 5 -> so position 5 is not correct for L)\n\nNow, we know the secret word:\n- Contains A, N, E, L (because they are marked present in both guesses) and does not contain C, R, P.\n- We have two new pieces of information: \n  - L is present (from guess 2), and it\'s not in position 5.\n\nAlso, from the positions:\nFor A: wrong in position 3 (from guess 1) and wrong in position 2 (from guess 2). So A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.\nSimilarly:\n  For N: wrong in position 4 (guess 1) and wrong in position 3 (guess 2). So N cannot be in positions 3 or 4.\n  For E: wrong in position 5 (guess 1) and wrong in position 4 (guess 2). So E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.\n  For L: wrong in position 5 (guess 2). We have only tried L in position 5, so it cannot be in 5, but could be in 1,2,3,4.\n\nMoreover, since the word has 5 letters and we know A, N, E, L must be in it, that accounts for 4 letters. The fifth letter is unknown (but not C, R, or P).\n\nPossible positions for A: positions 1, 4, 5? But note: we haven\'t tried position 1 or 4 for A? Actually, we tried A in 3 and 2, so positions 1,4,5 are still possible? But wait, the word must have A and it must be in one of the positions we haven\'t tried? But we have tried position 2 and 3. So only 1,4,5? But in a 5-letter word, positions are 1 to 5.\n\nSimilarly, for N: we tried in 4 (guess1) and 3 (guess2). So N cannot be in 3 or 4 -> available positions 1,2,5.\nFor E: tried in 5 (guess1) and 4 (guess2) -> cannot be in 4 or 5 -> available positions 1,2,3.\nFor L: tried only in 5 -> cannot be in 5 -> available positions 1,2,3,4.\n\nNow, we need to assign the letters A, N, E, L to positions 1 to 5 without using the forbidden positions for each, and we have one more letter to assign to the remaining position.\n\nWe also know that the fifth letter must be a letter not yet tried (or that hasn\'t been ruled out) and not C, R, P.\n\nBut note: we have only 4 letters: A, N, E, L. The word has 5 letters, so there must be a fifth letter. We don\'t know it yet.\n\nThe secret word has exactly 5 letters. We know it contains A, N, E, L and one more letter.\n\nWe must include a fifth letter that hasn\'t been guessed? We have tested only C, R, P (absent) and A, N, E, L (present). So the fifth letter could be any other letter of the alphabet.\n\nWe need to form a word that fits these constraints.\n\nLet me try to list possible positions for each:\n\n- A: must be in 1,4,5 (since not 2 or 3)\n- N: must be in 1,2,5 (since not 3 or 4)\n- E: must be in 1,2,3 (since not 4 or 5)\n- L: must be in 1,2,3,4 (since not 5)\n\nWe also have a fifth letter (say X) that goes in the remaining position.\n\nWe must assign one letter per position.\n\nAlso, note that a letter cannot be in two positions at once? Except if duplicates? But we haven\'t been told that there are duplicates, but we must consider? The feedback doesn\'t show duplicates? Actually, in feedback, each letter is marked separately, so if a letter appears twice, both would be marked? But we don\'t have any duplicates in the guesses so far, so we can\'t assume duplicates.\n\nWe\'ll assume no duplicates for now?\n\nBut let\'s see: we have 5 positions and 5 distinct letters: A, N, E, L, and X.\n\nWe need to assign A, N, E, L to 4 positions and X to the fifth.\n\nBut we cannot assign two letters to one position.\n\nSo we must allocate the positions without overlap.\n\nMoreover, the fifth letter X must be in a position that is available? Actually, we don\'t restrict X? X can be in any position? But we have to form a word.\n\nLet\'s try to see if we can find a word that fits.\n\nFirst, note that E must be in 1,2, or 3.\n\nA must be in 1,4, or 5.\n\nBut if A is in 1, then position 1 is taken by A, so E cannot be in 1? So they might conflict.\n\nSimilarly, N must be in 1,2,5.\n\nL must be in 1,2,3,4.\n\nWe have five positions, we need to assign letters to each.\n\nWe can consider the possibilities for position 1.\n\nPosition 1: could be A, N, E, L, or X? But let\'s see:\n\nSince E cannot be in 4 or 5, position 1 is available for E? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, A, N, L can be in position 1.\n\nBut let\'s list the possible assignments for the known letters:\n\nWe can try to assign A, N, E, L to four positions and leave one for X.\n\nBut we don\'t know X.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to find a word that includes A, N, E, L and one more letter, with the position constraints.\n\nLet me think of common English words containing A, N, E, L.\n\nPossible words: ""LANE"" but it\'s 4 letters. Need 5.\n\nAdding a letter: ""LEARN"" but R is absent? Can\'t use R.\n\n""LEANT"" -> has T, but we tried L in position 5? Wait, no: ""LEANT"" is L,E,A,N,T.\n\nBut in our position constraints:\n\nL: ? we haven\'t assigned, but in ""LEANT"", L is in position 1 -> allowed (we only know L not in 5).\nE is in position 2 -> allowed (E must be in 1,2,3).\nA is in position 3? But we know A cannot be in position 3. So A is in 3? Forbidden. So not.\n\n""ALIEN"" -> A,L,I,E,N.\n\nPositions:\nA in 1? -> allowed (since we haven\'t tried A in 1? Yes, and it\'s not forbidden).\nL in 2? -> allowed (we only know L not in 5; 2 is okay).\nI in 3? -> new letter.\nE in 4? -> but E cannot be in 4! Because from feedback E is not allowed in position 4 (from guess2). So E in 4 is forbidden.\n\nSo ""ALIEN"": E in 4 -> forbidden.\n\n""ALONE"" -> but O, and E in 4? Not allowed.\n\n""ANILE"" -> A,N,I,L,E -> positions: A(1), N(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). But E in 5? Forbidden! Because E cannot be in 5.\n\n""ELAND"" -> E,L,A,N,D.\n\nPosition 1: E? -> E in 1? Allowed? Yes, because E can be in 1,2,3.\nThen L in 2? -> allowed.\nA in 3? -> forbidden! A cannot be in 3.\nSo no.\n\nWe have to avoid A in positions 2 and 3? So only 1,4,5?\n\nAnd E in 1,2,3? So if A is in position 1, then E cannot be in position 1? So A and E can\'t both be in position 1? So if A is in 1, then E must be in 2 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, N in 1,2,5? If A is in 1, then N can be in 2 or 5.\n\nL in any but 5.\n\nLet\'s try:\n\nOption: A in position 1:\n  Then:\n    Position 1: A\n    Then E must be in 2 or 3.\n    N must be in 2 or 5? But position 2: if E is there, then N in 5? And L in 3 or 4? And the fifth letter in the other position.\n\n  Example word? ""ANLE?"" No.\n\n  Let me try: If A in 1, E in 2: then positions 1-A, 2-E.\n    Then position 2 is E -> no problem?\n    Then we need N and L and one more letter.\n\n    Then position 3: must be L or N? But N cannot be in position 3? Only 1,2,5? But 1 is taken, 2 taken, so N must be in 5? So N in 5? Then L can be in 3 or 4? And position 4 and 3: one for L and one for the fifth letter.\n\n    For example, word: ""A E _ _ N"" -> say ""A E L X N"" but then E is in 2? Then L in 3? Then X in 4? Then N in 5? But L in 3? Allowed? And N in 5? Also allowed? We haven\'t tried N in 5? But we know N can be in 5? Yes.\n\n    E in 2: allowed? Yes, because E rejected only from 4 and 5? So 2 is okay.\n\n    What words of the form A E L ? N: ""ae_L_N""? Not a word? ""AELXN"" doesn\'t work.\n\n    With A in 1, E in 2, N in 5: then we need L and X in positions 3 and 4.\n\n    Words: ""AXELN""? Not a word.\n\n    Is ""AGLEN"" a word? No.\n\n    Perhaps ""AVEL N""? Not 5 letters.\n\n    Or ""A E X L N"" -> I can think of ""EXAM"" but not.\n\nAnother possibility: A in 1, E in 3? Then:\n  Positions: 1-A, 3-E\n  E in 3: allowed? Yes, because E can be in 1,2,3? So 3 is okay.\n  Then N must be in 2 or 5? Because positions available: 2,4,5? But N can be in 1,2,5? But 1 taken? So 2 or 5.\n  L can be in 2,4? But 2 might be taken? Also, position 4 and 5? And the fifth letter.\n\nCase: N in position 2? Then we have A(1), N(2), E(3), then positions 4 and 5: L and fifth letter? But L cannot be in 5? So L must be in 4? And fifth letter in 5? Then the word is ""A N E L X"" -> ""ANELX""? Not a word.\n\nCase: N in position 5? Then we have A(1), ?, E(3), ?, N(5). So positions 2 and 4: for L and X? L can be in 4? Then X in 2? Or L in 2? So word: ""A X E L N"" -> ""AXELN"" not a word? Or ""A L E X N"" -> ""ALEXN"" not a word? ""ALIEN"" we tried already? But E is in 3? And if we put L in 2, X in 4? ""ALEXN"" is not a word? Or ""ALEFN"" no. \n\nAlternatively, we can try A in position 4 or 5.\n\nTry A in position 4?\nThen: \n  A in 4: that is allowed? Because we know A not in 2 or 3? So position 4 is new.\n  Now, we need to assign E, N, L.\n  E must be in 1,2,3? \n  N must be in 1,2,5?\n  L must be in 1,2,3,4? But 4 is taken by A? So L in 1,2,3?\n\n  So for E: 1,2,3? \n  Let me put E in position 1? Then we have position 1: E? Allowed? Yes.\n  Then N in 2 or 5? \n  L in 3? Or 2? \n  And fifth letter in the other.\n\n  Example: E in 1, then N in 2? Then L in 3? Then A in 4? Then position 5: fifth letter? So word: ""E N L A X"" -> ""ENLAX"" not a word? Or ""E N L A ?"" \n\n  Or put E in 1, then N in 5? Then word: E ? ? A N? Then we need L? In positions 2 or 3? And X in the other? So ""E X1 X2 A N"" -> and L must be in 2 or 3? So for example: ""E L ? A N""? But we need a letter in position 3? ""EL*AN"" -> like ""ELPAN"" but P is out? Or ""ELVAN"" ? ""ELVAN"" is not a word? Or ""ELDAN""? Not English.\n\n  ""OLEAN"" but O is a letter? And we have A in 4? But O in 1? But we have E in 1? Not.\n\nTry E in 2? Then position 2: E? A in position 4? Then N in 1 or 5? L in 3? Or what? Position 1? Must be filled by N or L? Etc.\n\nIt\'s getting messy. Let me try A in position 5?\nThen we have A at the end? And we know A cannot be in 2 or 3? So position 5 is new? And A can be there? From the constraints? Yes.\nThen:\n  Position 5: A.\n  Then E must be in 1,2,3? \n  N in 1,2,5? But 5 taken? So N in 1 or 2?\n  L in 1,2,3,4? But 4 available?\n  Fifth letter in some position.\n\nSo example: N in 1? Then E in 2 or 3? \nThen L in 3 or 4? \nFifth letter in the remaining position.\n\nWord: ""N E ? ? A""? Or ""N E L ? A""? \n\nFor example: ""N E L X A"" -> ""NELXA""? No? Or ""NELLA"" but has double L? And A is in position 5? ""NELLA"" is a proper name? Or not a common word.\n\nAnother one: ""BALED"" -> but we tried? B is new? ""BALED"": B,A,L,E,D -> A in 2? But A cannot be in position 2? Because in guess2 we tried A in position 2 and it was wrong position? So A must not be in 2.\n\nSo if we put A in 5, we avoid position 2 and 3? So okay.\n\nWhat are common words with A at the end? \n\nLike ""ULTRA"" but U,L,T,R,A -> R is absent? Cannot use R.\n\n""MANGA"" -> M,A,N,G,A -> duplicate A? And A in positions 2 and 5? But A in 2 is forbidden? We know A must not be in 2? So ""MANGA"" has A in 2? Not allowed.\n\n""ARENA"" -> A in 1? But also in 4? A in 1 is allowed, but we have R which is absent? And A in 1: then E in the word? Etc. Not allowed.\n\nBack to the constraints: include A, N, E, L and one more, with positions:\n\nMaybe we should try a word where L is in position 1? Then A in 4 or 5? Etc.\n\nBut let me list all the forbidden positions we know:\n\n- A: cannot be in 2 or 3\n- N: cannot in 3 or 4\n- E: cannot in 4 or 5\n- L: cannot in 5\n\nAvailable positions by letter:\nA: 1,4,5\nN: 1,2,5\nE: 1,2,3\nL: 1,2,3,4\n\nAnd we have to assign these letters to exactly one position each? Because no duplicates? And then assign X to the last.\n\nBut we have 5 positions and 5 letters.\n\nSo we must have one position for each: A, N, E, L, and X.\n\nLet me try to make a position assignment.\n\nTry position 1: which letter can go? E? Then:\n  Position 1: E (allowed)\n  Then for position 2: who can go? A, N, L (because E is taken)\n    Try A: not allowed in 2? So no.\n    Try N: allowed? Yes, because N can be in 1,2,5? But 1 taken? So 2 allowed? Yes.\n      Then position 2: N. \n      Then position 3: who? A, L (E taken, N taken) -> A cannot be in 3? So only L. L in position 3? Allowed? Yes.\n        Then positions 4 and 5: for A and X? But A must be in 4 or 5? \n        Also, position 4: if A is there, then position 4: A? Allowed? Yes.\n        Then position 5: X? But E cannot be in 5? That\'s for E? But this is X? So okay. But L cannot be in 5? But we have L in 3? Safe.\n\n        And X in 5? but we don\'t know what letter. So the word: E, N, L, A, X? Positions 1: E, 2: N, 3: L, 4: A, 5: X.\n\n        This fits: ""E N L A X"" -> but not a word? We can try to find an English word ending like this? Sounds like ""EN X A"" not.\n\n        Or if we swap: position 4: X, position 5: A? Then word: ""E N L X A"" -> ""X"" in 4, ""A"" in 5. But what words are like that? ""ENOBA"" or something? Not common.\n\n    After position 2 being N, for position 3, if we don\'t put L, then only X? But then where to put L? We haven\'t assigned L? Then L must be in position 4? Because it cannot be in 5? So ""E, N, X, L, A""? Word: ""ENXLA""? Not a word.\n\nTry position 1: L? \n  Then:\n    Position 1: L (allowed)\n    Then position 2: available for A, N, E? \n      A: cannot in 2? So no.\n      N: allowed in 2? Yes.\n        Then position 2: N.\n        Then position 3: available for E (since A cannot be in 3, but E can be in 3) -> so E in 3? Allowed? Yes.\n          Then positions 4 and 5: for A and X? But A must be in 4 or 5? \n          Position 4: A? Allowed? Yes.\n          Position 5: X? Allowed? But L cannot be in 5, but this is X? So okay.\n\n          Word: L, N, E, A, X? or ""L,N,E,X,A"" -> positions 1:L, 2:N, 3:E, 4:A, 5:X -> word ""LNEAX""? Not a word.\n\n          Or position 4: X? position 5: A? -> ""L,N,E,X,A"" -> ""LNEXA"" not a word.\n\n      Or for position 2: if we put E? Allowed? Yes, position 2: E? Then:\n        Then position 2: E.\n        Then position 3: Cannot be A? So only N or L or X? But N cannot be in 3? So L or X? Try L: position 3: L? Not forbidden? L in 3 is allowed.\n          Then position 4 and 5: for A and X? A must be in 4 or 5? \n          If A in 4? A in position 4: allowed? Yes.\n          Position 5: X? Then word: ""L, E, L, A, X"" duplicate L? And ""LELAX"" not a word? And we have duplicate L? Maybe not.\n\n          Position 4: X; position 5: A? ""L,E,L,X,A""? ""LELXA"" not a word.\n\n        If position 3: X? then in position 4 and 5: for A and N? Because N must be in 5? (since position 4 cannot for N? and position 5 is available? N can be in 5? Then: position 4 could be A? in 4: allowed? And position 5: N? allowed? So word: ""L, E, X, A, N"" -> ""LEXAN""? Is that a word?\n\n        ""LEXAN"" is not a common English word? Maybe not.\n\nNow, try position 1: N? \n  Allow N in 1.\n  Then position 2: can be E? (since A cannot, and N taken) -> E in 2? allowed? Yes.\n    Then position 2: E.\n    Then position 3: can be L? (A cannot, E and N taken) -> L in 3? allowed? Then:\n        Positions 4 and 5: for A and X? \n        A cannot be in 2 or 3, so could be 4 or 5? \n        If A in 4? Then X in 5: word as ""N E L A X"" -> NELAX not word.\n        If A in 5? Then X in 4: ""N E L X A""-> NELXA not word.\n\n    Or position 3: X? then positions 4 and 5: for A and L? But L must be assigned? L cannot be in 5? So L must be in 4? then A in 5? -> ""N E X L A"" -> NEXLA not word? \n\nWe are struggling to find a word. Maybe there\'s a duplicate letter.\n\nOr perhaps we missed a common word.\n\nAnother idea: fifth letter might be \'S\'? of \'T\'? etc.\n\nLet me recall that in panel, we got feedback that A, N, E, L are present! So the word at this point must have exactly A, N, E, L and one more letter.\n\nCommon words: ""ELAND"" -> E, L, A, N, D -> E in 1, L in 2, A in 3? But A in 3 is forbidden.\n\n""ANLEP""? Not a word.\n\n""LANES"" -> L, A, N, E, S -> But A in position 2? forbidden? Because in panel we had A in 2 and it was wrong position? So A cannot be in 2.\n\n""LEASE"" -> L, E, A, S, E -> duplicate E? And A in 3? forbidden.\n\n""CANEL"" -> C is out? Not.\n\n""ANGEL"" -> A, N, G, E, L.\nPositions: A in 1? Allowed.\n N in 2? Allowed.\n G in 3? new letter.\n E in 4? for bidden! Because E cannot be in 4.\n\n""AN CLE"" not.\n\n""NUTELLA"" too long.\n\n""FLANE"" not 5.\n\n""ELAN plus one letter?\n\nPerhaps the fifth letter is \'D\': ""ELAND"" again, but issues.\n\n""ENDED""-> dup E? but we know E is present, so possibly dup? But let\'s see.\n\n But in ""ENDED"", positions: E(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), D(5). But E in 1: allowed. N in 2: allowed. E in 4? forbidden! Cannot.\n\n""LANDE"" -> L, A, N, D, E -> A in 2? forbidden.\n\n"" DEAN"" 4 letters.\n\n""STAND"" not L.\n\n Another word: ""SAL\t ET"" not.\n\n I recall that we haven\'t tried the fifth letter much. We should guess a word that has A, N, E, L in positions meeting the constraints, and a new letter.\n\nLet me try ""ANEAR"" but R is out.\n\n""ANELE"" -> A, N, E, L, E? duplicate E? And positions: A in 1, N in 2, E in 3, L in 4, E in 5? That\'s only 4 unique letters, but duplicate E.\n\nBut with duplicate E: still,positions? A in 1? Allowed. N in 2? Allowed. E in 3? Allowed. L in 4? Allowed. E in 5? Forbidden! Because E cannot be in 5. So one E in 3 is allowed, but the other in 5? Not. So not.\n\n Perhaps.\n\n Maybe ""ALANE"" . ""ALANE"" is a word? and positions: A(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), E(5) -> A in 1 allowed, L in 2 allowed? But A in 3? forbidden! And E in 5 forbidden.\n\nAlternatively, how about E in 1, W in 2, A in 4, L in 3, N in 5? but does that form a word? ""E W A L N"" -> ""EWALN"" not a word? or ""EWANL"" no.\n\nPerhaps ""WELง"" not.\n\n I think we need to search systematically.\n\nLet\'s go for A in position 4? and E in position 1? which we tried before.\n\nWith E in 1, A in 4, then N in 5? and L in 2 or 3? \nIf L in 2: then position 3: X? -> word: ""E L X A N"" -> ""ELXAN"" not word.\nIf L in 3: ""E X L A N"" -> ""EXLAN"" not word.\n\nOr with A in 5? and E in 1, then N in 1 or 2? position 1 occupied by E? So N in 2? Then position 3: X? position 4: L? then ""E N X L A"" , so ""ENXLA"" not word.\n\n or position 3: L? position 4: X? ""E N L X A"" - ""EN LX A"" not.\n\nBut ""ENOLA"" is a word? ""ENOLA"": E,N,O,L,A -> positions: E(1), N(2), O(3), L(4), A(5).\n\nLet\'s check the constraints:\nA: position 5? allowed. (since it can be in 1,4,5)\nN: position 2? allowed. (since cannot be in 3 or 4, and 2 is okay)\nE: position 1? allowed.\nL: position 4? allowed. (since not 5)\n\n fifth letter O in position 3? which is new.\n\nAlso, O has not been tried? And not C,R,P.\n\nSo ""ENOLA"" is a valid English word? Enola is a name, sometimes accepted? But we need a common word.\n\nPerhaps ""KENE L"" no.\n\n another word: ""MEAN L"" with M, but then ""AN M E"" etc.\n\n""HEALD"" only 5 if we use, but not having A in 4 or 5? etc.\n\nActually, ""ENOLA"" might be acceptable. But let\'s see if there\'s a better choice.\n\nAnother common word: ""LATER"" but R is out.\n\n""WALES"" -> W,A,L,E,S -> but A in 2? forbidden.\n\n""LANES"" . A in 2? forbidden.\n\n""LEANS"" . L(1), E(2), A(3), N(4), S(5) -> A in 3? forbidden. N in 4? forbidden. E in 2 we haven tried but in this case, A in 3 is already invalid.\n\n onsecond thought, we have to bite the bullet and choose a word even if it\'s a name. Or is there a better?\n\n""SANEL""? not word.\n\n""ANELE"" with E in 5.\n\n""EL 0 A N"" with O? \'ELOAN""? ""ELOAN"" is not a word. ""E"" loan no.\n\nWhat about ""Navel"" -> N,A,V,E,L -> A in 2? for forbidden! position 2? We know A cannot be in 2.\n\n""VALEN"" -> V,A,L,E,N -> A in 2? again forbidden.\n\n""NE A L S"" -> ""NEALS""? as in kneecap? not.\n\n Perhaps ""ILEAN"" not word.\n\nGiven the difficulty, maybe there\'s a mistake or we need to consider that the fifth letter is S.\n\nTry ""S a e L 0"", no.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the secret word has duplicate letters? For instance, two N\'s or something? But in our guesses, we haven\'t seen duplicate feedback, but it\'s possible.\n\nFor example, maybe the word is ""L E E A N"" but E in 1 and 2, and A in 4? then N in 5? etc.\n\nLet me try: ""LEEAN"" not a word.\n\n""AL EEN"" not.\n\n""ENEMA"" no L.\n\nRecall that in feedback for guess2: L was present but not in position 5? So we know L is in the word.\n\nNew strategy: we can ignore the fifth letter for a moment and focus on placing A, N, E, L in allowed positions and forming a valid wordtem.\n\nWe know:\n- A not in 2,3 -> so in 1,4,5\n- N not in 3,4 -> in 1,2,5\n- E not in 4,5 -> in 1,2,3\n- L not in 5 -> in 1,2,3,4\n\nChoose a word that has these four letters and an additional letter, satisfying position constraints.\n\nUse a word finder program? But we can\'t, so rack brains.\n\nCommon 5-letter words with A, E, L, N:\n\n- ""LENIENT"" too long.\n- ""PLANE"" -> P is out? We know P is absent.\n- ""ELANE"" not.\n- ""LEANT"" -> A in 3, N in 4? forbidd.\n- ""N ELAL"" no.\n- ""ANEL E"" no.\n\n I recall that ""ELAND"" is an animal. Let\'s re- check positions for ""ELAND"": positions 1:E, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:D. But A in 3 is forbidden, and also E in 1 is allowed, L in 2 is allowed? New? but A in 3 is not allowed. Plus, N in 4 is not allowed. So it violates.\n\n""Д A L E N"" L in 1, A in 2 which is not allowed.\n\n Another word: ""A U L N E"" not.\n\nAfter exhaustive search, found: Given the constraints, a word like ""KNEEL"" has two E\'s? then A no \'A\'. Must include A.\n\nPerhaps ""SELEN"" only 5 letters? no.\n\n It\'s taking too long.\n\nLet\'s try the word ""CANE"" only 4.\n Or ""LANE"" 4.\n\n One word: ""OLE IN"" not.\n\n I think we may have to for ""ENOLA"" as a guess. It matches all constraints and is a proper name. Or ""ALONE"" only we saw earlier? Let\'s check ""ALONE"": positions - A(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). \n\nFor A: position 1? allowed? Yes.\nL: position 2? allowed? Yes? (not tried before? we only know L not in 5? 2 is new)\nO: position 3? new.\nN: position 4? forbidden! Because in first guess N was in 4 and wrong, and in second guess we for N in 3 and wrong? and position 4 for N is not allowed? from first guess: N in 4 was wrong position? so N cannot be in 4, and here it\'s in 4? so we cannot use.\n\nAnother word: ""ANODE"" has A in 1, N in 2, O in 3, E in 5? forbidden for E.\n\n""ABED"" only 4.\n\nI think for the sake of progress, let\'s guess ""ENOLA"". \n\n Reasons:\n- Meets the position constraints:\n  E in 1: allowed\n  N in 2: allowed\n  O in 3: new letter, not tested and not forbidden.\n  L in 4: allowed\n  A in 5: allowed\n\n- Contains A, N, E, L and O as fifth letter.\n\n- O is a vowel, hasn\'t been tested.\n\n- ""Enola"" is a word (proper name, but sometimes accepted in word games).\n\nAlternatively, is there ""LEN O A"" no. \n\n We have to make a guess.\n\nSo I will guess ""ENOLA"".\n\nBut note: the feedback for duplicates? But we don\'t have duplicates here.\n\nSo guess: ""ENOLA""\n\n<guess>enola</guess>\n\nBut wait, let\'s double-check the constraints:\n\nSecret word must contain A, N, E, L. ""ENOLA"" has E, N, O, L, A -> yes.\n\nPositions:\n\nE in 1? Is there any feedback that would make E in 1 forbidden? No, because we know E should be in 1,2,3.\n\nN in 2: and we know N should not be in 3 or 4? 2 is not 3 or 4, so ok.\n\nL in 4: and we know L should not be in 5? 4 is not 5, so ok.\n\nA in 5: and we know A should not be in 2 or 3? 5 is not 2 or 3, so ok.\n\nO in 3: a new letter.\n\nSo this fits all the constraints we have.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""ENOLA"".\n\n<guess>enola</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(-)\nGuess 3: enola -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(-) O(x) L(-) A(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\n1.

""enola"": E(present but wrong position), N(present but wrong position), O(absent), L(present but wrong position), A(present but wrong position)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The letters C, R, P, O are absent.\n- The letters A, N, E, L are present (each is ""present"" in all guesses where they appeared).\n- We have position constraints for A, N, E, L based on previous feedback.\n\nSpecifically, let\'s list the correct and forbidden positions for each letter:\n\n**For A:**\n- In ""crane"" (position 3), A was marked wrong position → so correct position is not 3.\n- In ""panel"" (position 2), A was marked wrong position → not 2.\n- In ""enola"" (position 5), A was marked wrong position → not 5.\n- Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 4 (since positions 2,3,5 are forbidden).\n\n**For N:**\n- In ""crane"" (position 4), wrong position → not 4.\n- In ""panel"" (position 3), wrong position → not 3.\n- In ""enola"" (position 2), wrong position → not 2.\n- Therefore, N must be in position 1 or 5 (since positions 2,3,4 are forbidden).\n\n**For E:**\n- In ""crane"" (position 5), wrong position → not 5.\n- In ""panel"" (position 4), wrong position → not 4.\n- In ""enola"" (position 1), wrong position → not 1.\n- Therefore, E must be in position 2 or 3 (since positions 1,4,5 are forbidden).\n\n**For L:**\n- In ""panel"" (position 5), wrong position → not 5.\n- In ""enola"" (position 4), wrong position → not 4.\n- Therefore, L must be in position 1,2, or 3 (since positions 4 and 5 are forbidden).\n\nWe also know that the word contains exactly these four letters (A, N, E, L) and one additional letter that is not C, R, P, O. This fifth letter must be one we haven\'t guessed yet, and it cannot be any of the absent letters.\n\nNow, let\'s consider possible consistent placements:\n\n1. **N position:** N must be in 1 or 5.\n2. **A position:** A must be in 1 or 4.\n3. **E position:** E must be in 2 or 3.\n4. **L position:** L must be in 1,2,3.\n\nBut note: positions must be distinct. \n\n**Case 1: N in position 1**\nThen:\n- Position 1: N\n- A cannot be in 1, so A must be in 4 (since other options forbidden).\n- E must be in 2 or 3.\n- L must be in 2 or 3 (but cannot conflict with E).\n\nSo possible subcases:\n- If E in 2, L in 3: Then positions: 1=N, 2=E, 3=L, 4=A, 5=? (fifth letter)\n- If E in 3, L in 2: Then positions: 1=N, 2=L, 3=E, 4=A, 5=?\n\nIn both subcases, position 5 is the fifth letter.\n\n**Case 2: N in position 5**\nThen:\n- Position 5: N\n- A must be in 1 or 4.\n- E must be in 2 or 3.\n- L must be in 1,2,3.\n\nIf A in 1:\n- Position 1: A\n- Positions 2,3: for E and L? \n- E in 2 or 3, L in the other.\n- For example: E in 2, L in 3 or E in 3, L in 2.\n- Then position 4: fifth letter.\n\nIf A in 4:\n- Position 4: A\n- Position 1: then could be L (since L can be in 1) or fifth letter?\n- Position 5: N, so 5 is taken.\n- E must be in 2 or 3.\n- L must be in 1,2,3.\n\nSubcases:\n- If L in 1: then E in 2 or 3: positions 1=L, 2=E (or E in 3), 3=? (if E in 2, then position 3 could be fifth letter; if E in 3, position 2 could be fifth letter).\n- Or L in 2 or 3.\n\nBut this may be messy. Let\'s list possible words consistent with the feedback.\n\nGiven the constraints, we should form a guess that tests the possible placements and introduces a new letter.\n\nSince we know the word has A, N, E, L, we can aim for a word that satisfies one of the above cases.\n\nFor example, take Case 1 with N in 1, E in 2, L in 3, A in 4: then the word would be N, E, L, A, ? for position 5. We need a fifth letter, say X, and it must be a valid English word ""NELAX"" – not a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, with N in 1, E in 3, L in 2: ""N, L, E, A, X"" → ""NLEAX"" – not valid.\n\nNow Case 2: N in 5.\nSubcase: A in 1, E in 2, L in 3: ""A, E, L, X, N"" for positions 1-5 → A E L X N. Is ""ELXN"" a word? No.\n\nA in 1, E in 2, L in 3: word would be A, E, L, ?, N → ""A E L X N"" → e.g., ""aelxn"" not word.\n\nBut if instead of having the fifth letter in position 4, note that positions: 1=A, 2=E, 3=L, 4=?, 5=N. We need a word like ""A E L _ N"". \n\nWhat English words fit this pattern? \n- ""alien"" but we tried already? Alien has I, but not N at the end. ""Alien"" is A,L,I,E,N, which has E in 4? Not our pattern.\n\nPattern: positions 1:A, 2:E, 3:L, 4:?, 5:N. So ""AEL?N"". \n\nExamples: ""AELIN"" not word. ""AELON"" not. Perhaps ""alkin"" no.\n\nAlternatively, subcase: A in 1, E in 3, L in 2: ""A, L, E, X, N"" → ""A L E X N"". Words: ""alexn"" not, but ""ALEX"" is 4 letters. Not.\n\nTry possible word: In the feedback for ""enola"", L is in position 4 and marked wrong position, but in our case we are putting L in other positions.\n\nAnother pattern from Case 2 with N in 5: A in 4, then L in 1, then E in 2 or 3.\n\nSuppose L in 1, E in 2, A in 4, N in 5: then positions 1=L, 2=E, 3=?, 4=A, 5=N. So word ""L E ? A N"".\n\nWhat words? Like ""L E M A N"" (leman) which is a word, meaning a lover or sweetheart. Also, ""le""gan"" etc.\n\n""LEMAN"" is a valid English word! Let\'s check constraints:\n\n- Positions: L(1), E(2), M(3), A(4), N(5)\n\nCheck against feedback:\n- L: in position 1 – we have not tried L in 1 before? And our constraints say L can be in 1? Yes, since L not in 4 or 5.\n- E: in position 2 – E must be in 2 or 3? Yes.\n- A: in position 4 – A can be in 1 or 4? Yes.\n- N: in position 5 – N can be in 1 or 5? Yes.\n\nNew letter M, which hasn\'t been guessed, so not known to be absent.\n\nAdditionally, M is not C, R, P, O, so allowed.\n\nMoreover, in previous guesses: \n- ""crane"" tested C,R,A,N,E – M not tested.\n- ""panel"" tested P,A,N,E,L – M not tested.\n- ""enola"" tested E,N,O,L,A – O tested and absent, M not tested.\n\nSo ""LEMAN"" should be a good guess.\n\nConfirm the word: L E M A N.\n\nNow, let\'s see if it fits all feedback:\n\n- No known absent letters: C, R, P, O are absent, but M is new.\n- Positions: L is in 1 (not 4 or 5), E in 2 (not 1,4,5), A in 4 (not 2,3,5), N in 5 (not 2,3,4).\n\nAlso, the fifth letter M in position 3.\n\nThis satisfies all known information.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""LEMAN"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, R are absent; A, N, E are present but in wrong positions (not 3, 4, or 5 respectively).\n- **Guess 2 (""panel"")**: P is absent; A, N, E, L are present but in wrong positions (A not 2, N not 3, E not 4, L not 5).\n- **Guess 3 (""enola"")**: O is absent; E, N, L, A are present but in wrong positions (E not 1, N not 2, L not 4, A not 5).\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Absent letters**: C, R, P, O are confirmed absent. All other letters not ruled out are possible.\n2. **Present letters**: A, N, E, L are in the word but must be placed in positions consistent with feedback:\n   - **A**: Must not be in positions 2, 3, or 5 → Allowed positions: 1 or 4.\n   - **N**: Must not be in positions 2, 3, or 4 → Allowed positions: 1 or 5.\n   - **E**: Must not be in positions 1, 4, or 5 → Allowed positions: 2 or 3.\n   - **L**: Must not be in positions 4 or 5 → Allowed positions: 1, 2, or 3.\n3. **Word composition**: The secret word consists of A, N, E, L, and one unknown letter (excluding C, R, P, O). This unknown letter must be new.\n4. **Possible configurations**: Considering constraints:\n   - If N is in position 1 (allowed), A must be in position 4 (since A cannot be in 1 if N is there). E must be in 2 or 3, L in the remaining position of 2 or 3, leaving position 5 for the fifth letter → Leads to invalid word patterns (e.g., ""NELAX"").\n   - If N is in position 5 (allowed), A could be in 1 or 4:\n     - If A in position 1, E and L must be in positions 2 and 3 → Leaves position 4 for the fifth letter. Words like ""AELXN"" are invalid.\n     - If A in position 4, L could be in position 1 → Leaves E in 2 or 3 and position 3 or 2 for the fifth letter. This yields ""L E ? A N"". A valid English word fitting this pattern is ""LEMAN"" (L in position 1, E in 2, fifth letter M in 3, A in 4, N in 5).\n\n""LEMAN"" satisfies all feedback:\n- L (position 1) → Not tried before; no conflict since L cannot be in 4/5.\n- E (position 2) → Allowed (E must be in 2/3).\n- M (new letter) → Not ruled out (not C, R, P, O).\n- A (position 4) → Allowed (A must be in 1/4).\n- N (position 5) → Allowed (not in 2/3/4).\n\nThis guess tests M as the fifth unknown letter and checks all position constraints efficiently.\n\n<guess>leman</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(-)\nGuess 3: enola -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(-) O(x) L(-) A(-)\nGuess 4: leman -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(-) M(x) A(✓) N(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from Guess 4: ""leman"" -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(-) M(x) A(✓) N(✓)
This means:
- L: present, but wrong position (since it's marked '-', meaning in the word but not in the correct position)
- E: present, but wrong position
- M: absent (marked 'x')
- A: correct position (marked '✓') and in position 4? Because in ""leman"", A is in position 4.
- N: correct position (marked '✓') and in position 5? In ""leman"", N is in position 5.

Recall previous constraints:

For A: 
  - Previously known: not in 2,3,5 (from prior feedback) and now it's in 4 and marked correct. So A must be in position 4.

For N:
  - Previously known: not in 2,3,4 and now it's in 5 and marked correct. So N must be in position 5.

Thus, we now know:
- Position 4: A (confirmed correct)
- Position 5: N (correct)

Also, M is absent, so the secret word does not contain M.

Now, the word so far is: _ _ _ A N

We also know that E and L are present but in the wrong positions in ""leman"". Given the positions of ""leman"" are 1:L, 2:E, 3:M, 4:A, 5:N.

Since L and E are both present but wrong positions, and positions 4 and 5 are fixed (A and N), so L and E must be in positions 1,2, or 3? But in ""leman"", we placed L at 1 and E at 2, and they were marked wrong positions. So L is not at position 1, and E is not at position 2. And since both are still present, they must be elsewhere in the word? But the word only has two other positions: 3 and possibly one more? We have positions 1,2,3 to fill, but wait:

The word is _ _ _ A N (positions 1-5).

We know:
- Position 1: cannot be L? Because we tried L at position 1 and it was wrong.
- Position 2: cannot be E? Because we tried E at position 2 and it was wrong.
- Also, we know E must be in the word? So E must be in position 1 or 3? Because positions 4 and 5 are fixed, and positions 1,2,3 are open? But we tried E at position 2, so E must be in 1 or 3?
Similarly, L must be in the word? And we tried L at position 1? So L must be in position 2 or 3? Because position 4 is A and 5 is N.

But also, we know from prior feedback that E must be in position 2 or 3? From previous guess inferences? But now we have new information.

Actually, from previous feedback alone we had E must be in positions 2 or 3, and now we know position 2 is wrong? So E must be in position 3? Because position 4 and 5 are fixed? Let's reconsider:

Previous position constraints based only on prior feedback (before guess 4) we had:
- E: must be in position 2 or 3? Because we had multiple feedbacks.

Now, from guess 4's feedback:
- E is in the word but not in position 2? And also, since position 4 and 5 are fixed? So E must be in position 1 or 3? But position 1? We must not forget positions.

But actually, the word has positions 1,2,3 to fill? And position 4=A, position 5=N.

Now, L and E must be in positions 1,2,3? But we know L is not in position 1? And E is not in position 2? Also, they cannot be in 4 or 5? So:

- E must be in position 1 or 3? Because position 2 we tried and it failed.
- L must be in position 2 or 3? Because position 1 we tried and failed.

But the word has only three positions 1,2,3 to fill? And we have L, E, and one more letter? Because we know the word contains exactly two more letters: E and L? Or more?

Earlier we knew the word has exactly A, N, E, L? And a fifth letter? But we didn't know the fifth letter? Now we know the fifth letter? Or do we need to find it.

Let's list the knowns:
- The word has A at position 4, N at position 5, so positions 1,2,3 are unknown.
- We know the word contains E and L? And they must be somewhere in positions 1,2,3.
- Also, there is a fifth letter? Because we haven't guessed it yet? We don't know if there is one additional or not.

But from feedback in guess 4: we have L(-) meaning L is present? But wrong position? Similarly E(-) present. But that doesn't say if there's duplicates? But we have two other letters? Actually, we have three positions, so three letters: one of which is E or L? But actually, E and L are two letters? And we need a fifth letter? So the word has A, N, E, L, and a fifth letter? But we just discovered M is absent? So the fifth letter must be something else?

Therefore, the word has five distinct letters: A, N, E, L, and one more letter to find? Because we have three positions: 1,2,3? And E and L must be among these three? Along with a third letter? Or duplicate? But we shouldn't assume.

By the feedback, we know E and L are present? So they must be in positions 1,2,3? But we have place for three letters? So yes, the remaining three positions? Must be occupied by E, L, and the fifth letter? But not necessarily? Because E and L could appear, and the fifth letter, but also possibly duplicate.

But from the feedback marks: in guess 4, we have four marks: L(-), E(-), M(x), A(✓), N(✓). This covers: L present, E present, M absent? So the word contains at least A, N, E, L? But M is absent? So yes, we have one unknown letter to find? Which is in position 1,2, or 3.

Now, positions:
- Position 1: Cannot be L? Because we tried L in position 1 and it was wrong? Also cannot be E? Or can it? E is possible?
- Position 2: Cannot be E? Because we tried E in 2? Also cannot be M? But we know M absent? But what about L? L can be at position 2.
- Position 3: No constraints so far? 

Specifically for position 1: we tried L in position 1 (""leman""), and it was marked '-', so L is not at position 1? Therefore, L must be at position 2 or 3? Similarly, E was tried at position 2? So E cannot be at position 2? Therefore, E must be at position 1 or 3? 

But also, we have a fifth letter? So the three positions: 1,2,3:
- Position 1: cannot be L? So it must be E or the fifth letter?
- Position 2: cannot be E? So it must be L or the fifth letter?
- Position 3: can be E, L, or the fifth letter?

We need to place E, L, and the fifth letter in positions 1,2,3? Such that L is not in 1, E not in 2? 

But also, remember from earlier feedback (prior to guess 4) we had constraints:

For E: cannot be in positions 1,4,5? So E must be in 2 or 3? But now we know it cannot be in 2? So E must be in position 3? Because 1? Was that previously forbidden?

Recall: after guess 3, we had: for E: cannot be in 1,4,5? Why? Because:
- In guess 1: E in 5? Marked '-'
- In guess 2: E in 4? Marked '-'
- In guess 3: E in 1? Marked '-'? But guess 3: ""enola"" had E in position 1? And feedback E(-)? So indeed, E is present but not in position 1.

Therefore, combining:
- E cannot be in position 1 (from guess 3), not in 4 or 5 (from guess 1 and 2), and not in 2 (from guess 4)? Wait, guess 4 feedback: E(-) and E is in position 2? So position 2 is also invalid? Since guess 4 E in 2 is marked wrong? 

Therefore, E has been tried in positions 1,2,4,5? All wrong? So the only position left is position 3? Thus, E must be in position 3? 

Similarly, for L:
- L in guess 2: position 5? Marked wrong? 
- L in guess 3: position 4? Marked wrong?
- L in guess 4: position 1? Marked wrong?
- So L has been tried in positions 1,4,5? All wrong? Therefore, L can only be in position 2 or 3? 

But position 3 may be taken by E? If E is fixed at 3, then L must be in position 2? Because position 3 occupied? 

Therefore, we infer:
- Position 3: must be E? 
- Then L must be in position 2? Because positions 1,4,5 invalid for L? And 4,5 fixed? So L must be in 2? 
- Then position 1 must be the fifth letter? 

Thus, the word is: ? L E A N, where ? is the fifth letter?

That is: position 1: fifth letter, position 2: L, position 3: E, position 4: A, position 5: N? 

Now, the fifth letter must be a letter not absent? And we haven't guessed correctly.

Absent letters: C, R, P, O, M? From guess 4: M absent? So the fifth letter must be a letter not among C,R,P,O,M? 

But and not among A,N,E,L? So it must be a new letter.

We know there is one letter to guess? So we need to guess a 5-letter word ending with ""LEAN"" but no? The word is [X] L E A N? So the word is ? L E A N? So ""XLEAN""

But what words exist? Like ""CLEAN"", but C is absent? ""Clean"" has C? But C is ruled out? Similarly, R? Or ""PLEAN"" not word? ""GLEAN"" is a word? Meaning to gather or collect.

""GLEAN"": G,L,E,A,N? 

And G has not been tested? And not absent? So possible.

Other possibilities? ""BLEAN""? Not a word? ""FLEAN"" not? So ""GLEAN"" seems a good candidate.

Let's confirm:
- ""GLEAN"" positions: G(1), L(2), E(3), A(4), N(5)
- Check feedback consistency:
  - Position 1: G? New letter? Not tested? So not absent? 
  - Position 2: L? We know L should be there? And in the feedback, L was marked wrong? But why? In guess 4, we didn't have L in position 2? We had in position 1? So this is new? And we haven't tried L in position 2? 
  - Position 3: E? Now we know E must be in 3? 
  - Position 4: A? Correct? Just as in guess 4? Confirmed.
  - Position 5: N? Correct.

Also, with ""GLEAN"", the previous feedback:
- Guess 1: ""crane"" → A in 3? But A is in position 4? So indeed wrong position? 
- Guess 2: ""panel"" → A in 2? But position 4? Wrong? Etc.

Thus, ""GLEAN"" should satisfy.

Therefore, we guess ""GLEAN"".

Previous feedback summary:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(absent), R(absent), A(present-wrong position), N(present-wrong position), E(present-wrong position). This excluded positions 2/3 for A, 3/4 for N, and 4/5 for E.
- **Guess 2 (""panel"")**: P(absent), A(present-wrong position), N(present-wrong position), E(present-wrong position), L(present-wrong position). This excluded position 2 for A, position 3 for N, position 4 for E, and position 5 for L.
- **Guess 3 (""enola"")**: E(present-wrong position), N(present-wrong position), O(absent), L(present-wrong position), A(present-wrong position). This excluded positions 1 for E, 2 for N, 4 for L, and 5 for A.
- **Guess 4 (""leman"")**: L(present-wrong position), E(present-wrong position), M(absent), A(correct position), N(correct position). This confirmed:
  - Position 4 is A.
  - Position 5 is N.
  - M is absent.
  - L is not in position 1 (tried) and must be in position 2 or 3.
  - E is not in position 2 (tried) and must be in position 3 (since all other positions are invalid based on aggregated feedback).

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**:
   - Position 4 = A (✓ from guess 4).
   - Position 5 = N (✓ from guess 4).
2. **Remaining positions**:
   - Positions 1, 2, and 3 are unknown.
3. **Letter constraints**:
   - **E**: Must be in position 3 (since positions 1/2/4/5 are invalid per guesses 1–4).
   - **L**: Must be in position 2 (since positions 1/4/5 are invalid per guesses 2–4; position 3 is now occupied by E).
   - Position 1 must be a new letter not in {A, N, E, L} and not absent (C, R, P, O, M).
4. **Confirmed letters**: The word contains A, N, E, L, and one unknown letter (not absent).

### New Guess Structure:
- Position 1: Unknown letter (e.g., ""G"").
- Position 2: L (L must be here).
- Position 3: E (E must be here).
- Position 4: A.
- Position 5: N.

Thus, the pattern is `_ L E A N`. Valid English words:
- **""GLEAN""** (meaning to gather information or harvest) fits:
  - G = New letter (not absent).
  - L in position 2, E in position 3, A in position 4, N in position 5.
- Alternatives (""BLEAN"", ""FLEAN"", etc.) are not valid words.

- Also, there is a fifth letter? Because we haven't guessed it yet? We don't know if there is one additional or not.

But from feedback in guess 4: we have L(-) meaning L is present? But wrong position? Similarly E(-) present. But that doesn't say if there's duplicates? But we have two other letters? Actually, we have three positions, so three letters: one of which is E or L? But actually, E and L are two letters? And we need a fifth letter? So the word has A, N, E, L, and a fifth letter? But we just discovered M is absent? So the fifth letter must be something else?

Therefore, the word has five distinct letters: A, N, E, L, and one more letter to find? Because we have three positions: 1,2,3? And E and L must be among these three? Along with a third letter? Or duplicate? But we shouldn't assume.

By the feedback, we know E and L are present? So they must be in positions 1,2,3? But we have place for three letters? So yes, the remaining three positions? Must be occupied by E, L, and the fifth letter? But not necessarily? Because E and L could appear, and the fifth letter, but also possibly duplicate.

But from the feedback marks: in guess 4, we have four marks: L(-), E(-), M(x), A(✓), N(✓). This covers: L present, E present, M absent? So the word contains at least A, N, E, L? But M is absent? So yes, we have one unknown letter to find? Which is in position 1,2, or 3.

Now, positions:
- Position 1: Cannot be L? Because we tried L in position 1 and it was wrong? Also cannot be E? Or can it? E is possible?
- Position 2: Cannot be E? Because we tried E in 2? Also cannot be M? But we know M absent? But what about L? L can be at position 2.
- Position 3: No constraints so far? 

Specifically for position 1: we tried L in position 1 (""leman""), and it was marked '-', so L is not at position 1? Therefore, L must be at position 2 or 3? Similarly, E was tried at position 2? So E cannot be at position 2? Therefore, E must be at position 1 or 3? 

But also, we have a fifth letter? So the three positions: 1,2,3:
- Position 1: cannot be L? So it must be E or the fifth letter?
- Position 2: cannot be E? So it must be L or the fifth letter?
- Position 3: can be E, L, or the fifth letter?

We need to place E, L, and the fifth letter in positions 1,2,3? Such that L is not in 1, E not in 2? 

But also, remember from earlier feedback (prior to guess 4) we had constraints:

For E: cannot be in positions 1,4,5? So E must be in 2 or 3? But now we know it cannot be in 2? So E must be in position 3? Because 1? Was that previously forbidden?

Recall: after guess 3, we had: for E: cannot be in 1,4,5? Why? Because:
- In guess 1: E in 5? Marked '-'
- In guess 2: E in 4? Marked '-'
- In guess 3: E in 1? Marked '-'? But guess 3: ""enola"" had E in position 1? And feedback E(-)? So indeed, E is present but not in position 1.

Therefore, combining:
- E cannot be in position 1 (from guess 3), not in 4 or 5 (from guess 1 and 2), and not in 2 (from guess 4)? Wait, guess 4 feedback: E(-) and E is in position 2? So position 2 is also invalid? Since guess 4 E in 2 is marked wrong? 

Therefore, E has been tried in positions 1,2,4,5? All wrong? So the only position left is position 3? Thus, E must be in position 3? 

Similarly, for L:
- L in guess 2: position 5? Marked wrong? 
- L in guess 3: position 4? Marked wrong?
- L in guess 4: position 1? Marked wrong?
- So L has been tried in positions 1,4,5? All wrong? Therefore, L can only be in position 2 or 3? 

But position 3 may be taken by E? If E is fixed at 3, then L must be in position 2? Because position 3 occupied? 

Therefore, we infer:
- Position 3: must be E? 
- Then L must be in position 2? Because positions 1,4,5 invalid for L? And 4,5 fixed? So L must be in 2? 
- Then position 1 must be the fifth letter? 

Thus, the word is: ? L E A N, where ? is the fifth letter?

That is: position 1: fifth letter, position 2: L, position 3: E, position 4: A, position 5: N? 

Now, the fifth letter must be a letter not absent? And we haven't guessed correctly.

Absent letters: C, R, P, O, M? From guess 4: M absent? So the fifth letter must be a letter not among C,R,P,O,M? 

But and not among A,N,E,L? So it must be a new letter.

We know there is one letter to guess? So we need to guess a 5-letter word ending with ""LEAN"" but no? The word is [X] L E A N? So the word is ? L E A N? So ""XLEAN""

But what words exist? Like ""CLEAN"", but C is absent? ""Clean"" has C? But C is ruled out? Similarly, R? Or ""PLEAN"" not word? ""GLEAN"" is a word? Meaning to gather or collect.

""GLEAN"": G,L,E,A,N? 

And G has not been tested? And not absent? So possible.

Other possibilities? ""BLEAN""? Not a word? ""FLEAN"" not? So ""GLEAN"" seems a good candidate.

Let's confirm:
- ""GLEAN"" positions: G(1), L(2), E(3), A(4), N(5)
- Check feedback consistency:
  - Position 1: G? New letter? Not tested? So not absent? 
  - Position 2: L? We know L should be there? And in the feedback, L was marked wrong? But why? In guess 4, we didn't have L in position 2? We had in position 1? So this is new? And we haven't tried L in position 2? 
  - Position 3: E? Now we know E must be in 3? 
  - Position 4: A? Correct? Just as in guess 4? Confirmed.
  - Position 5: N? Correct.

Also, with ""GLEAN"", the previous feedback:
- Guess 1: ""crane"" → A in 3? But A is in position 4? So indeed wrong position? 
- Guess 2: ""panel"" → A in 2? But position 4? Wrong? Etc.

Thus, ""GLEAN"" should satisfy.

Therefore, we guess ""GLEAN"". 

<guess>glean</guess>Previous feedback summary:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(absent), R(absent), A(present-wrong position), N(present-wrong position), E(present-wrong position). This excluded positions 2/3 for A, 3/4 for N, and 4/5 for E.
- **Guess 2 (""panel"")**: P(absent), A(present-wrong position), N(present-wrong position), E(present-wrong position), L(present-wrong position). This excluded position 2 for A, position 3 for N, position 4 for E, and position 5 for L.
- **Guess 3 (""enola"")**: E(present-wrong position), N(present-wrong position), O(absent), L(present-wrong position), A(present-wrong position). This excluded positions 1 for E, 2 for N, 4 for L, and 5 for A.
- **Guess 4 (""leman"")**: L(present-wrong position), E(present-wrong position), M(absent), A(correct position), N(correct position). This confirmed:
  - Position 4 is A.
  - Position 5 is N.
  - M is absent.
  - L is not in position 1 (tried) and must be in position 2 or 3.
  - E is not in position 2 (tried) and must be in position 3 (since all other positions are invalid based on aggregated feedback).

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**:
   - Position 4 = A (✓ from guess 4).
   - Position 5 = N (✓ from guess 4).
2. **Remaining positions**:
   - Positions 1, 2, and 3 are unknown.
3. **Letter constraints**:
   - **E**: Must be in position 3 (since positions 1/2/4/5 are invalid per guesses 1–4).
   - **L**: Must be in position 2 (since positions 1/4/5 are invalid per guesses 2–4; position 3 is now occupied by E).
   - Position 1 must be a new letter not in {A, N, E, L} and not absent (C, R, P, O, M).
4. **Confirmed letters**: The word contains A, N, E, L, and one unknown letter (not absent).

### New Guess Structure:
- Position 1: Unknown letter (e.g., ""G"").
- Position 2: L (L must be here).
- Position 3: E (E must be here).
- Position 4: A.
- Position 5: N.

Thus, the pattern is `_ L E A N`. Valid English words:
- **""GLEAN""** (meaning to gather information or harvest) fits:
  - G = New letter (not absent).
  - L in position 2, E in position 3, A in position 4, N in position 5.
- Alternatives (""BLEAN"", ""FLEAN"", etc.) are not valid words.",Guess 5: glean -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) L(✓) E(✓) A(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
