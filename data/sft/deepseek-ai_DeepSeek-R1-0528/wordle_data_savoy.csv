We are starting a new game. Since it's the first guess, I don't have any feedback to work with.
 The goal is to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. Common practice is to use a word with common letters and no repeating letters.

 Possible starting words: words like ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""WORDY"", etc. that cover common vowels and consonants.

 I remember that ""SLATE"" is a popular starting word because it has common letters: S, L, A, T, E.

 Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also good.

 Since there are 6 tries, I'll pick a word that uses five distinct letters and includes vowels and common consonants.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.

 After this guess, I will get feedback and can then refine.

 So my first guess will be: CRANE

We are given feedback for the first guess ""STARE"":
- S: ✓ (correct position)
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The first letter is S. (since it's correct and in position 1)
2. The letter T is not in the secret word at all.
3. The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (where we guessed it). So A must be in one of the positions 3, 4, or 5.
4. The letters R and E are not in the word.

Also, since T, R, and E are not in the word, we can avoid them in future guesses.

The secret word has the following constraints:
- Starts with S.
- Contains A, but not in position 2.
- Does not contain T, R, E.

We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter English word.

We should try to include other common letters to get more information, while respecting the known constraints.

Possible letters to try: We know S is first, so we can fix that. We also know A is in the word but not in position 2. So in our next guess, we can put A in a different position (like 3,4, or 5) to test.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

We also know that the word does not have T, R, E. So we can avoid those.

Let's think of words that start with S and have an A in a position other than 2.

Also, we should try to include other common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried yet. We haven't used: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common vowels: O, I, U. We already have A, so we might try O or I.

Common consonants: N, L, C, D, etc.

We can try to form a word that starts with S, has A in position 3,4, or 5, and includes other new letters.

For example:
- If we put A in position 3: then the word pattern is S _ A _ _
- If we put A in position 4: S _ _ A _
- If we put A in position 5: S _ _ _ A

But we don't know which one, so we might choose a word that puts A in one of these and also tests other common letters.

Alternatively, we could avoid putting A in the same wrong position (position 2) but we already know it's not there, so we can put it in 3,4, or 5.

Let me list some candidate words:

Option 1: Put A in position 3. Then the word is S _ A _ _. We need to fill the blanks with letters not in {T, R, E} and not repeating (if possible). Also, we want to test new letters.

For example: ""SALAD"" -> but has two A's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters, but to maximize information, we should avoid duplicates for now.

Better: ""SALON"" -> S, A, L, O, N. But we have A in position 3? Actually: S-A-L-O-N -> positions: S1, A2? Wait, we are putting A in position 3? Let me spell:

If we want A in position 3: then the word would be like S, then any letter in position 2, then A in position 3, then two more.

But we don't know what is in position 2. We know T is not in the word, and we also know that position 2 is not A (from feedback). So we can try a word with a new letter in position 2.

For example: ""SHADE"" -> but E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So avoid E.

Similarly, avoid R and T.

So let's try: ""SNAIL"" -> S, N, A, I, L. This has A in position 3? 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: L

But we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 3. By putting it in position 3, we can test if it is there.

Alternatively, we could put A in position 4 or 5 to test other positions.

But note: we have limited tries, so we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since we know A is in the word, we can try to put it in a position we haven't tested (like 4 or 5) and also test other common letters.

But we also have to remember that we have the first letter fixed as S.

Let me think of words starting with S, having A, and avoiding T, R, E.

Some words: 
- SALAD (but duplicate A, and we don't know if duplicate is allowed, but it's valid) -> but has A in position 2? S-A-L-A-D -> position 2 is A, which we know is wrong. So we cannot put A in position 2 again. So SALAD is invalid for our purpose because we know A is not in position 2.

We must avoid putting A in position 2 because we already know it's not there.

So A must be in position 3,4, or 5.

Let me try to find words with A in position 3: 
- SCALY: S, C, A, L, Y -> positions: 1:S, 2:C, 3:A, 4:L, 5:Y -> avoids T,R,E.
- SHALL: S, H, A, L, L -> but has duplicate L? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but it's a valid word. However, we might avoid duplicates to get more information.

Similarly, with A in position 4:
- SONAR: S, O, N, A, R -> but R is not allowed (we know R is not in the word). So invalid.
- SOLAR: same, has R -> invalid.
- SODA: only 4 letters? No, 5 letters: we need 5 letters.

What about ""SOAPY""? S, O, A, P, Y -> but A is in position 3? Let's see: S-O-A-P-Y -> position 3 is A? Actually: 
1: S
2: O
3: A
4: P
5: Y

So that's A in position 3.

But we want A in position 4? Let me think of words with A in position 4.

For example: 
- ""STOIC"" -> but T is not allowed, and we have T in it? S-T-O-I-C -> T is in position 2, but we know T is not in the word. So invalid.

Another: ""SPLAT"" -> T is not allowed.

Avoiding T, R, E.

How about ""SNAKY""? S, N, A, K, Y -> A in position 3.

To have A in position 4: 
- ""COSTA"" -> doesn't start with S? We need to start with S.

Words starting with S and A in position 4: 
- ""SUSAN"" -> S, U, S, A, N -> but duplicate S? And we know S is already in position 1, but the word might have another S? We don't know. But we can try. However, we have S in position 1 and 3? That might be confusing.

But we know S is in position 1, and if there is another S, we might get feedback on that.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

Another word: ""SHIVA"" -> but V and H, and A in position 5? S-H-I-V-A -> position 5 is A.

So that's A in position 5.

We can choose a word that has A in a new position and also tests other common letters.

But we also want to cover more vowels or common consonants.

Given that we have only one letter fixed (S in position 1) and one letter known (A somewhere else), we should try to test as many new letters as possible.

So a good candidate might be a word that starts with S, has A in position 5 (to test that position), and uses three new common letters.

For example: ""SONIC"" -> but has O, N, I, C. But wait, we don't know if O, N, I, C are in the word. However, ""SONIC"" has no A? We need to include A because we know it's in the word? Actually, we don't have to include A in the guess? But we can, to get more information about A's position.

But if we don't include A, we won't know where A is. Since we know A is in the word, we should try to find its position.

So we should include A in the guess, but in a position other than 2.

Let me list some words that start with S, have A in position 3,4, or 5, and avoid T, R, E.

Candidate 1: ""SCALY"" -> S, C, A, L, Y -> A in position 3.
Candidate 2: ""SHADY"" -> but D and Y, and A in position 3? S-H-A-D-Y -> position 3 is A? Actually: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:D, 5:Y -> but we have A in position 3.
Candidate 3: ""SOAPY"" -> S, O, A, P, Y -> 1:S, 2:O, 3:A, 4:P, 5:Y -> A in position 3.

But we can also try A in position 4: 
- ""SILVA"" -> S, I, L, V, A -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:L, 4:V, 5:A -> A in position 5? Wait, position 5 is A.

Actually, for position 4: 
- ""SPINA"" -> S, P, I, N, A -> 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:N, 5:A -> so A in position 5? That's not position 4.

To have A in position 4: 
- ""SABRA"" -> but A in position 2? Not allowed.
- ""SEDAN"" -> but E is not allowed.

Another: ""SOFTA"" -> T and E? Not allowed.

It's hard to find a word with A in position 4 without using forbidden letters.

Similarly, position 5 is easier.

So let's go with A in position 5.

Words: 
- ""SONIA"" -> S, O, N, I, A -> 1:S, 2:O, 3:N, 4:I, 5:A -> avoids T,R,E.
- ""SCUBA"" -> S, C, U, B, A -> 1:S, 2:C, 3:U, 4:B, 5:A -> also good.
- ""SHOLA"" -> S, H, O, L, A -> 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:L, 5:A.

We can choose one that has common letters.

I think ""SONIA"" is a proper name? But Wordle accepts some proper nouns? Usually, it's common words. Better to use common words.

""SCUBA"" is common.

""SHOLA"" might be less common.

Another common word: ""SEPIA"" -> but E is not allowed.

So ""SCUBA"" or ""SONIA"". Let's choose ""SCUBA"" because it has more common consonants.

But we also want to test vowels. We have U in ""SCUBA"".

Alternatively, we can use ""SALON"" but that has A in position 2? No, S-A-L-O-N -> position 2 is A, which we cannot do.

We must avoid position 2 for A.

So ""SCUBA"" is good: S, C, U, B, A.

But let me confirm: 
- Position 1: S (fixed, we know it's correct, so we expect a check for S)
- Position 2: C (new)
- Position 3: U (new)
- Position 4: B (new)
- Position 5: A (we know A is in the word, but we are testing if it's in position 5)

If we get feedback that A is correct in position 5, then we know. If not, then A must be in position 3 or 4 (since we know it's not in 2).

But we are testing position 5.

This guess will also tell us about C, U, B.

So it's a good information-rich guess.

Another candidate: ""SNAKY"" -> S, N, A, K, Y -> with A in position 3? 1:S, 2:N, 3:A, 4:K, 5:Y.

That also tests N, K, Y.

But ""SCUBA"" tests C, U, B which are also common.

I think both are fine. I'll go with ""SCUBA"".

But note: we have to avoid the known absent letters: T, R, E. ""SCUBA"" has none of them.

So let's guess ""SCUBA"".

But wait, in the feedback, we have A marked as present but wrong position in the first guess. In ""SCUBA"", we are putting A in position 5. If the secret word has A in position 5, then we get a check. If not, then we know A is in 3 or 4.

Also, we get feedback on C, U, B.

So it's a good guess.

Therefore, my second guess is ""SCUBA"".
</think>
<thinking>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""STARE"":
- S is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- T is not in the word (x).
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- R is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

Key insights:
- The secret word starts with S.
- A is present but not in position 2, so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- T, R, and E are absent, so they can be excluded from future guesses.
- The second guess should:
  - Start with S (to confirm position 1, though it's already known).
  - Include A in a new position (3, 4, or 5) to test its location.
  - Avoid T, R, E.
  - Introduce new common letters to maximize information gain.

After considering options like ""SNAKY"" (A in position 3) and ""SONIA"" (A in position 5), I chose ""SCUBA"" because:
- It starts with S (position 1).
- It places A in position 5 (testing a new position for A).
- It introduces three new common letters: C (position 2), U (position 3), and B (position 4).
- It avoids T, R, E and has no duplicate letters.
- This guess will help narrow down the position of A and reveal whether C, U, or B are in the word.

If A is in position 5, it will get a ✓; if not, A must be in position 3 or 4. The feedback on C, U, and B will further constrain possibilities for the next guess.
</thinking>

<guess>SCUBA</guess>",SCUBA,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""STARE"":
- S: ✓ (correct position)
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The first letter is S. (since it's correct and in position 1)
2. The letter T is not in the secret word at all.
3. The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (where we guessed it). So A must be in one of the positions 3, 4, or 5.
4. The letters R and E are not in the word.

Also, since T, R, and E are not in the word, we can avoid them in future guesses.

The secret word has the following constraints:
- Starts with S.
- Contains A, but not in position 2.
- Does not contain T, R, E.

We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter English word.

We should try to include other common letters to get more information, while respecting the known constraints.

Possible letters to try: We know S is first, so we can fix that. We also know A is in the word but not in position 2. So in our next guess, we can put A in a different position (like 3,4, or 5) to test.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

We also know that the word does not have T, R, E. So we can avoid those.

Let's think of words that start with S and have an A in a position other than 2.

Also, we should try to include other common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried yet. We haven't used: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common vowels: O, I, U. We already have A, so we might try O or I.

Common consonants: N, L, C, D, etc.

We can try to form a word that starts with S, has A in position 3,4, or 5, and includes other new letters.

For example:
- If we put A in position 3: then the word pattern is S _ A _ _
- If we put A in position 4: S _ _ A _
- If we put A in position 5: S _ _ _ A

But we don't know which one, so we might choose a word that puts A in one of these and also tests other common letters.

Alternatively, we could avoid putting A in the same wrong position (position 2) but we already know it's not there, so we can put it in 3,4, or 5.

Let me list some candidate words:

Option 1: Put A in position 3. Then the word is S _ A _ _. We need to fill the blanks with letters not in {T, R, E} and not repeating (if possible). Also, we want to test new letters.

For example: ""SALAD"" -> but has two A's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters, but to maximize information, we should avoid duplicates for now.

Better: ""SALON"" -> S, A, L, O, N. But we have A in position 3? Actually: S-A-L-O-N -> positions: S1, A2? Wait, we are putting A in position 3? Let me spell:

If we want A in position 3: then the word would be like S, then any letter in position 2, then A in position 3, then two more.

But we don't know what is in position 2. We know T is not in the word, and we also know that position 2 is not A (from feedback). So we can try a word with a new letter in position 2.

For example: ""SHADE"" -> but E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So avoid E.

Similarly, avoid R and T.

So let's try: ""SNAIL"" -> S, N, A, I, L. This has A in position 3? 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: L

But we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 3. By putting it in position 3, we can test if it is there.

Alternatively, we could put A in position 4 or 5 to test other positions.

But note: we have limited tries, so we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since we know A is in the word, we can try to put it in a position we haven't tested (like 4 or 5) and also test other common letters.

But we also have to remember that we have the first letter fixed as S.

Let me think of words starting with S, having A, and avoiding T, R, E.

Some words: 
- SALAD (but duplicate A, and we don't know if duplicate is allowed, but it's valid) -> but has A in position 2? S-A-L-A-D -> position 2 is A, which we know is wrong. So we cannot put A in position 2 again. So SALAD is invalid for our purpose because we know A is not in position 2.

We must avoid putting A in position 2 because we already know it's not there.

So A must be in position 3,4, or 5.

Let me try to find words with A in position 3: 
- SCALY: S, C, A, L, Y -> positions: 1:S, 2:C, 3:A, 4:L, 5:Y -> avoids T,R,E.
- SHALL: S, H, A, L, L -> but has duplicate L? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but it's a valid word. However, we might avoid duplicates to get more information.

Similarly, with A in position 4:
- SONAR: S, O, N, A, R -> but R is not allowed (we know R is not in the word). So invalid.
- SOLAR: same, has R -> invalid.
- SODA: only 4 letters? No, 5 letters: we need 5 letters.

What about ""SOAPY""? S, O, A, P, Y -> but A is in position 3? Let's see: S-O-A-P-Y -> position 3 is A? Actually: 
1: S
2: O
3: A
4: P
5: Y

So that's A in position 3.

But we want A in position 4? Let me think of words with A in position 4.

For example: 
- ""STOIC"" -> but T is not allowed, and we have T in it? S-T-O-I-C -> T is in position 2, but we know T is not in the word. So invalid.

Another: ""SPLAT"" -> T is not allowed.

Avoiding T, R, E.

How about ""SNAKY""? S, N, A, K, Y -> A in position 3.

To have A in position 4: 
- ""COSTA"" -> doesn't start with S? We need to start with S.

Words starting with S and A in position 4: 
- ""SUSAN"" -> S, U, S, A, N -> but duplicate S? And we know S is already in position 1, but the word might have another S? We don't know. But we can try. However, we have S in position 1 and 3? That might be confusing.

But we know S is in position 1, and if there is another S, we might get feedback on that.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

Another word: ""SHIVA"" -> but V and H, and A in position 5? S-H-I-V-A -> position 5 is A.

So that's A in position 5.

We can choose a word that has A in a new position and also tests other common letters.

But we also want to cover more vowels or common consonants.

Given that we have only one letter fixed (S in position 1) and one letter known (A somewhere else), we should try to test as many new letters as possible.

So a good candidate might be a word that starts with S, has A in position 5 (to test that position), and uses three new common letters.

For example: ""SONIC"" -> but has O, N, I, C. But wait, we don't know if O, N, I, C are in the word. However, ""SONIC"" has no A? We need to include A because we know it's in the word? Actually, we don't have to include A in the guess? But we can, to get more information about A's position.

But if we don't include A, we won't know where A is. Since we know A is in the word, we should try to find its position.

So we should include A in the guess, but in a position other than 2.

Let me list some words that start with S, have A in position 3,4, or 5, and avoid T, R, E.

Candidate 1: ""SCALY"" -> S, C, A, L, Y -> A in position 3.
Candidate 2: ""SHADY"" -> but D and Y, and A in position 3? S-H-A-D-Y -> position 3 is A? Actually: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:D, 5:Y -> but we have A in position 3.
Candidate 3: ""SOAPY"" -> S, O, A, P, Y -> 1:S, 2:O, 3:A, 4:P, 5:Y -> A in position 3.

But we can also try A in position 4: 
- ""SILVA"" -> S, I, L, V, A -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:L, 4:V, 5:A -> A in position 5? Wait, position 5 is A.

Actually, for position 4: 
- ""SPINA"" -> S, P, I, N, A -> 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:N, 5:A -> so A in position 5? That's not position 4.

To have A in position 4: 
- ""SABRA"" -> but A in position 2? Not allowed.
- ""SEDAN"" -> but E is not allowed.

Another: ""SOFTA"" -> T and E? Not allowed.

It's hard to find a word with A in position 4 without using forbidden letters.

Similarly, position 5 is easier.

So let's go with A in position 5.

Words: 
- ""SONIA"" -> S, O, N, I, A -> 1:S, 2:O, 3:N, 4:I, 5:A -> avoids T,R,E.
- ""SCUBA"" -> S, C, U, B, A -> 1:S, 2:C, 3:U, 4:B, 5:A -> also good.
- ""SHOLA"" -> S, H, O, L, A -> 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:L, 5:A.

We can choose one that has common letters.

I think ""SONIA"" is a proper name? But Wordle accepts some proper nouns? Usually, it's common words. Better to use common words.

""SCUBA"" is common.

""SHOLA"" might be less common.

Another common word: ""SEPIA"" -> but E is not allowed.

So ""SCUBA"" or ""SONIA"". Let's choose ""SCUBA"" because it has more common consonants.

But we also want to test vowels. We have U in ""SCUBA"".

Alternatively, we can use ""SALON"" but that has A in position 2? No, S-A-L-O-N -> position 2 is A, which we cannot do.

We must avoid position 2 for A.

So ""SCUBA"" is good: S, C, U, B, A.

But let me confirm: 
- Position 1: S (fixed, we know it's correct, so we expect a check for S)
- Position 2: C (new)
- Position 3: U (new)
- Position 4: B (new)
- Position 5: A (we know A is in the word, but we are testing if it's in position 5)

If we get feedback that A is correct in position 5, then we know. If not, then A must be in position 3 or 4 (since we know it's not in 2).

But we are testing position 5.

This guess will also tell us about C, U, B.

So it's a good information-rich guess.

Another candidate: ""SNAKY"" -> S, N, A, K, Y -> with A in position 3? 1:S, 2:N, 3:A, 4:K, 5:Y.

That also tests N, K, Y.

But ""SCUBA"" tests C, U, B which are also common.

I think both are fine. I'll go with ""SCUBA"".

But note: we have to avoid the known absent letters: T, R, E. ""SCUBA"" has none of them.

So let's guess ""SCUBA"".

But wait, in the feedback, we have A marked as present but wrong position in the first guess. In ""SCUBA"", we are putting A in position 5. If the secret word has A in position 5, then we get a check. If not, then we know A is in 3 or 4.

Also, we get feedback on C, U, B.

So it's a good guess.

Therefore, my second guess is ""SCUBA"".<thinking>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""STARE"":
- S is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- T is not in the word (x).
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- R is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

Key insights:
- The secret word starts with S.
- A is present but not in position 2, so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- T, R, and E are absent, so they can be excluded from future guesses.
- The second guess should:
  - Start with S (to confirm position 1, though it's already known).
  - Include A in a new position (3, 4, or 5) to test its location.
  - Avoid T, R, E.
  - Introduce new common letters to maximize information gain.

After considering options like ""SNAKY"" (A in position 3) and ""SONIA"" (A in position 5), I chose ""SCUBA"" because:
- It starts with S (position 1).
- It places A in position 5 (testing a new position for A).
- It introduces three new common letters: C (position 2), U (position 3), and B (position 4).
- It avoids T, R, E and has no duplicate letters.
- This guess will help narrow down the position of A and reveal whether C, U, or B are in the word.

If A is in position 5, it will get a ✓; if not, A must be in position 3 or 4. The feedback on C, U, and B will further constrain possibilities for the next guess.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. Since it's the first guess, I don't have any feedback to work with.
 The goal is to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. Common practice is to use a word with common letters and no repeating letters.

 Possible starting words: words like ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""WORDY"", etc. that cover common vowels and consonants.

 I remember that ""SLATE"" is a popular starting word because it has common letters: S, L, A, T, E.

 Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also good.

 Since there are 6 tries, I'll pick a word that uses five distinct letters and includes vowels and common consonants.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.

 After this guess, I will get feedback and can then refine.

 So my first guess will be: CRANE<thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and vowels. I'll pick a word with:
- Common consonants like R, S, T
- Multiple vowels (ideally A and E)
- No repeated letters

Good starters include SLATE, CRANE, or STARE. I'll choose ""STARE"" because:
- It has S, T, R (common consonants)
- It includes A and E (two common vowels)
- Covers five distinct letters
This should give useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities.
</thinking>

<guess>STARE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(-) R(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""STARE"":
- S: ✓ (correct position)
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The first letter is S. (since it's correct and in position 1)
2. The letter T is not in the secret word at all.
3. The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (where we guessed it). So A must be in one of the positions 3, 4, or 5.
4. The letters R and E are not in the word.

Also, since T, R, and E are not in the word, we can avoid them in future guesses.

The secret word has the following constraints:
- Starts with S.
- Contains A, but not in position 2.
- Does not contain T, R, E.

We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter English word.

We should try to include other common letters to get more information, while respecting the known constraints.

Possible letters to try: We know S is first, so we can fix that. We also know A is in the word but not in position 2. So in our next guess, we can put A in a different position (like 3,4, or 5) to test.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

We also know that the word does not have T, R, E. So we can avoid those.

Let's think of words that start with S and have an A in a position other than 2.

Also, we should try to include other common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried yet. We haven't used: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common vowels: O, I, U. We already have A, so we might try O or I.

Common consonants: N, L, C, D, etc.

We can try to form a word that starts with S, has A in position 3,4, or 5, and includes other new letters.

For example:
- If we put A in position 3: then the word pattern is S _ A _ _
- If we put A in position 4: S _ _ A _
- If we put A in position 5: S _ _ _ A

But we don't know which one, so we might choose a word that puts A in one of these and also tests other common letters.

Alternatively, we could avoid putting A in the same wrong position (position 2) but we already know it's not there, so we can put it in 3,4, or 5.

Let me list some candidate words:

Option 1: Put A in position 3. Then the word is S _ A _ _. We need to fill the blanks with letters not in {T, R, E} and not repeating (if possible). Also, we want to test new letters.

For example: ""SALAD"" -> but has two A's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters, but to maximize information, we should avoid duplicates for now.

Better: ""SALON"" -> S, A, L, O, N. But we have A in position 3? Actually: S-A-L-O-N -> positions: S1, A2? Wait, we are putting A in position 3? Let me spell:

If we want A in position 3: then the word would be like S, then any letter in position 2, then A in position 3, then two more.

But we don't know what is in position 2. We know T is not in the word, and we also know that position 2 is not A (from feedback). So we can try a word with a new letter in position 2.

For example: ""SHADE"" -> but E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So avoid E.

Similarly, avoid R and T.

So let's try: ""SNAIL"" -> S, N, A, I, L. This has A in position 3? 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: L

But we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 3. By putting it in position 3, we can test if it is there.

Alternatively, we could put A in position 4 or 5 to test other positions.

But note: we have limited tries, so we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since we know A is in the word, we can try to put it in a position we haven't tested (like 4 or 5) and also test other common letters.

But we also have to remember that we have the first letter fixed as S.

Let me think of words starting with S, having A, and avoiding T, R, E.

Some words: 
- SALAD (but duplicate A, and we don't know if duplicate is allowed, but it's valid) -> but has A in position 2? S-A-L-A-D -> position 2 is A, which we know is wrong. So we cannot put A in position 2 again. So SALAD is invalid for our purpose because we know A is not in position 2.

We must avoid putting A in position 2 because we already know it's not there.

So A must be in position 3,4, or 5.

Let me try to find words with A in position 3: 
- SCALY: S, C, A, L, Y -> positions: 1:S, 2:C, 3:A, 4:L, 5:Y -> avoids T,R,E.
- SHALL: S, H, A, L, L -> but has duplicate L? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but it's a valid word. However, we might avoid duplicates to get more information.

Similarly, with A in position 4:
- SONAR: S, O, N, A, R -> but R is not allowed (we know R is not in the word). So invalid.
- SOLAR: same, has R -> invalid.
- SODA: only 4 letters? No, 5 letters: we need 5 letters.

What about ""SOAPY""? S, O, A, P, Y -> but A is in position 3? Let's see: S-O-A-P-Y -> position 3 is A? Actually: 
1: S
2: O
3: A
4: P
5: Y

So that's A in position 3.

But we want A in position 4? Let me think of words with A in position 4.

For example: 
- ""STOIC"" -> but T is not allowed, and we have T in it? S-T-O-I-C -> T is in position 2, but we know T is not in the word. So invalid.

Another: ""SPLAT"" -> T is not allowed.

Avoiding T, R, E.

How about ""SNAKY""? S, N, A, K, Y -> A in position 3.

To have A in position 4: 
- ""COSTA"" -> doesn't start with S? We need to start with S.

Words starting with S and A in position 4: 
- ""SUSAN"" -> S, U, S, A, N -> but duplicate S? And we know S is already in position 1, but the word might have another S? We don't know. But we can try. However, we have S in position 1 and 3? That might be confusing.

But we know S is in position 1, and if there is another S, we might get feedback on that.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

Another word: ""SHIVA"" -> but V and H, and A in position 5? S-H-I-V-A -> position 5 is A.

So that's A in position 5.

We can choose a word that has A in a new position and also tests other common letters.

But we also want to cover more vowels or common consonants.

Given that we have only one letter fixed (S in position 1) and one letter known (A somewhere else), we should try to test as many new letters as possible.

So a good candidate might be a word that starts with S, has A in position 5 (to test that position), and uses three new common letters.

For example: ""SONIC"" -> but has O, N, I, C. But wait, we don't know if O, N, I, C are in the word. However, ""SONIC"" has no A? We need to include A because we know it's in the word? Actually, we don't have to include A in the guess? But we can, to get more information about A's position.

But if we don't include A, we won't know where A is. Since we know A is in the word, we should try to find its position.

So we should include A in the guess, but in a position other than 2.

Let me list some words that start with S, have A in position 3,4, or 5, and avoid T, R, E.

Candidate 1: ""SCALY"" -> S, C, A, L, Y -> A in position 3.
Candidate 2: ""SHADY"" -> but D and Y, and A in position 3? S-H-A-D-Y -> position 3 is A? Actually: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:D, 5:Y -> but we have A in position 3.
Candidate 3: ""SOAPY"" -> S, O, A, P, Y -> 1:S, 2:O, 3:A, 4:P, 5:Y -> A in position 3.

But we can also try A in position 4: 
- ""SILVA"" -> S, I, L, V, A -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:L, 4:V, 5:A -> A in position 5? Wait, position 5 is A.

Actually, for position 4: 
- ""SPINA"" -> S, P, I, N, A -> 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:N, 5:A -> so A in position 5? That's not position 4.

To have A in position 4: 
- ""SABRA"" -> but A in position 2? Not allowed.
- ""SEDAN"" -> but E is not allowed.

Another: ""SOFTA"" -> T and E? Not allowed.

It's hard to find a word with A in position 4 without using forbidden letters.

Similarly, position 5 is easier.

So let's go with A in position 5.

Words: 
- ""SONIA"" -> S, O, N, I, A -> 1:S, 2:O, 3:N, 4:I, 5:A -> avoids T,R,E.
- ""SCUBA"" -> S, C, U, B, A -> 1:S, 2:C, 3:U, 4:B, 5:A -> also good.
- ""SHOLA"" -> S, H, O, L, A -> 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:L, 5:A.

We can choose one that has common letters.

I think ""SONIA"" is a proper name? But Wordle accepts some proper nouns? Usually, it's common words. Better to use common words.

""SCUBA"" is common.

""SHOLA"" might be less common.

Another common word: ""SEPIA"" -> but E is not allowed.

So ""SCUBA"" or ""SONIA"". Let's choose ""SCUBA"" because it has more common consonants.

But we also want to test vowels. We have U in ""SCUBA"".

Alternatively, we can use ""SALON"" but that has A in position 2? No, S-A-L-O-N -> position 2 is A, which we cannot do.

We must avoid position 2 for A.

So ""SCUBA"" is good: S, C, U, B, A.

But let me confirm: 
- Position 1: S (fixed, we know it's correct, so we expect a check for S)
- Position 2: C (new)
- Position 3: U (new)
- Position 4: B (new)
- Position 5: A (we know A is in the word, but we are testing if it's in position 5)

If we get feedback that A is correct in position 5, then we know. If not, then A must be in position 3 or 4 (since we know it's not in 2).

But we are testing position 5.

This guess will also tell us about C, U, B.

So it's a good information-rich guess.

Another candidate: ""SNAKY"" -> S, N, A, K, Y -> with A in position 3? 1:S, 2:N, 3:A, 4:K, 5:Y.

That also tests N, K, Y.

But ""SCUBA"" tests C, U, B which are also common.

I think both are fine. I'll go with ""SCUBA"".

But note: we have to avoid the known absent letters: T, R, E. ""SCUBA"" has none of them.

So let's guess ""SCUBA"".

But wait, in the feedback, we have A marked as present but wrong position in the first guess. In ""SCUBA"", we are putting A in position 5. If the secret word has A in position 5, then we get a check. If not, then we know A is in 3 or 4.

Also, we get feedback on C, U, B.

So it's a good guess.

Therefore, my second guess is ""SCUBA"".<thinking>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""STARE"":
- S is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- T is not in the word (x).
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- R is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

Key insights:
- The secret word starts with S.
- A is present but not in position 2, so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- T, R, and E are absent, so they can be excluded from future guesses.
- The second guess should:
  - Start with S (to confirm position 1, though it's already known).
  - Include A in a new position (3, 4, or 5) to test its location.
  - Avoid T, R, E.
  - Introduce new common letters to maximize information gain.

After considering options like ""SNAKY"" (A in position 3) and ""SONIA"" (A in position 5), I chose ""SCUBA"" because:
- It starts with S (position 1).
- It places A in position 5 (testing a new position for A).
- It introduces three new common letters: C (position 2), U (position 3), and B (position 4).
- It avoids T, R, E and has no duplicate letters.
- This guess will help narrow down the position of A and reveal whether C, U, or B are in the word.

If A is in position 5, it will get a ✓; if not, A must be in position 3 or 4. The feedback on C, U, and B will further constrain possibilities for the next guess.

I\'ll choose ""STARE"" because:\n- It has S, T, R (common consonants)\n- It includes A and E (two common vowels)\n- Covers five distinct letters\nThis should give useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>STARE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(-) R(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""STARE"":\n- S: ✓ (correct position)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from this feedback, we know:\n1. The first letter is S. (since it\'s correct and in position 1)\n2. The letter T is not in the secret word at all.\n3. The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (where we guessed it). So A must be in one of the positions 3, 4, or 5.\n4. The letters R and E are not in the word.\n\nAlso, since T, R, and E are not in the word, we can avoid them in future guesses.\n\nThe secret word has the following constraints:\n- Starts with S.\n- Contains A, but not in position 2.\n- Does not contain T, R, E.\n\nWe need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter English word.\n\nWe should try to include other common letters to get more information, while respecting the known constraints.\n\nPossible letters to try: We know S is first, so we can fix that. We also know A is in the word but not in position 2. So in our next guess, we can put A in a different position (like 3,4, or 5) to test.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.\n\nWe also know that the word does not have T, R, E. So we can avoid those.\n\nLet\'s think of words that start with S and have an A in a position other than 2.\n\nAlso, we should try to include other common consonants and vowels that we haven\'t tried yet. We haven\'t used: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon vowels: O, I, U. We already have A, so we might try O or I.\n\nCommon consonants: N, L, C, D, etc.\n\nWe can try to form a word that starts with S, has A in position 3,4, or 5, and includes other new letters.\n\nFor example:\n- If we put A in position 3: then the word pattern is S _ A _ _\n- If we put A in position 4: S _ _ A _\n- If we put A in position 5: S _ _ _ A\n\nBut we don\'t know which one, so we might choose a word that puts A in one of these and also tests other common letters.\n\nAlternatively, we could avoid putting A in the same wrong position (position 2) but we already know it\'s not there, so we can put it in 3,4, or 5.\n\nLet me list some candidate words:\n\nOption 1: Put A in position 3. Then the word is S _ A _ _. We need to fill the blanks with letters not in {T, R, E} and not repeating (if possible). Also, we want to test new letters.\n\nFor example: ""SALAD"" -> but has two A\'s? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters, but to maximize information, we should avoid duplicates for now.\n\nBetter: ""SALON"" -> S, A, L, O, N. But we have A in position 3? Actually: S-A-L-O-N -> positions: S1, A2? Wait, we are putting A in position 3? Let me spell:\n\nIf we want A in position 3: then the word would be like S, then any letter in position 2, then A in position 3, then two more.\n\nBut we don\'t know what is in position 2. We know T is not in the word, and we also know that position 2 is not A (from feedback). So we can try a word with a new letter in position 2.\n\nFor example: ""SHADE"" -> but E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So avoid E.\n\nSimilarly, avoid R and T.\n\nSo let\'s try: ""SNAIL"" -> S, N, A, I, L. This has A in position 3? \n- Position 1: S\n- Position 2: N\n- Position 3: A\n- Position 4: I\n- Position 5: L\n\nBut we know A is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s in position 3. By putting it in position 3, we can test if it is there.\n\nAlternatively, we could put A in position 4 or 5 to test other positions.\n\nBut note: we have limited tries, so we want to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother idea: since we know A is in the word, we can try to put it in a position we haven\'t tested (like 4 or 5) and also test other common letters.\n\nBut we also have to remember that we have the first letter fixed as S.\n\nLet me think of words starting with S, having A, and avoiding T, R, E.\n\nSome words: \n- SALAD (but duplicate A, and we don\'t know if duplicate is allowed, but it\'s valid) -> but has A in position 2? S-A-L-A-D -> position 2 is A, which we know is wrong. So we cannot put A in position 2 again. So SALAD is invalid for our purpose because we know A is not in position 2.\n\nWe must avoid putting A in position 2 because we already know it\'s not there.\n\nSo A must be in position 3,4, or 5.\n\nLet me try to find words with A in position 3: \n- SCALY: S, C, A, L, Y -> positions: 1:S, 2:C, 3:A, 4:L, 5:Y -> avoids T,R,E.\n- SHALL: S, H, A, L, L -> but has duplicate L? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but it\'s a valid word. However, we might avoid duplicates to get more information.\n\nSimilarly, with A in position 4:\n- SONAR: S, O, N, A, R -> but R is not allowed (we know R is not in the word). So invalid.\n- SOLAR: same, has R -> invalid.\n- SODA: only 4 letters? No, 5 letters: we need 5 letters.\n\nWhat about ""SOAPY""? S, O, A, P, Y -> but A is in position 3? Let\'s see: S-O-A-P-Y -> position 3 is A? Actually: \n1: S\n2: O\n3: A\n4: P\n5: Y\n\nSo that\'s A in position 3.\n\nBut we want A in position 4? Let me think of words with A in position 4.\n\nFor example: \n- ""STOIC"" -> but T is not allowed, and we have T in it? S-T-O-I-C -> T is in position 2, but we know T is not in the word. So invalid.\n\nAnother: ""SPLAT"" -> T is not allowed.\n\nAvoiding T, R, E.\n\nHow about ""SNAKY""? S, N, A, K, Y -> A in position 3.\n\nTo have A in position 4: \n- ""COSTA"" -> doesn\'t start with S? We need to start with S.\n\nWords starting with S and A in position 4: \n- ""SUSAN"" -> S, U, S, A, N -> but duplicate S? And we know S is already in position 1, but the word might have another S? We don\'t know. But we can try. However, we have S in position 1 and 3? That might be confusing.\n\nBut we know S is in position 1, and if there is another S, we might get feedback on that.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.\n\nAnother word: ""SHIVA"" -> but V and H, and A in position 5? S-H-I-V-A -> position 5 is A.\n\nSo that\'s A in position 5.\n\nWe can choose a word that has A in a new position and also tests other common letters.\n\nBut we also want to cover more vowels or common consonants.\n\nGiven that we have only one letter fixed (S in position 1) and one letter known (A somewhere else), we should try to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nSo a good candidate might be a word that starts with S, has A in position 5 (to test that position), and uses three new common letters.\n\nFor example: ""SONIC"" -> but has O, N, I, C. But wait, we don\'t know if O, N, I, C are in the word. However, ""SONIC"" has no A? We need to include A because we know it\'s in the word? Actually, we don\'t have to include A in the guess? But we can, to get more information about A\'s position.\n\nBut if we don\'t include A, we won\'t know where A is. Since we know A is in the word, we should try to find its position.\n\nSo we should include A in the guess, but in a position other than 2.\n\nLet me list some words that start with S, have A in position 3,4, or 5, and avoid T, R, E.\n\nCandidate 1: ""SCALY"" -> S, C, A, L, Y -> A in position 3.\nCandidate 2: ""SHADY"" -> but D and Y, and A in position 3? S-H-A-D-Y -> position 3 is A? Actually: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:D, 5:Y -> but we have A in position 3.\nCandidate 3: ""SOAPY"" -> S, O, A, P, Y -> 1:S, 2:O, 3:A, 4:P, 5:Y -> A in position 3.\n\nBut we can also try A in position 4: \n- ""SILVA"" -> S, I, L, V, A -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:L, 4:V, 5:A -> A in position 5? Wait, position 5 is A.\n\nActually, for position 4: \n- ""SPINA"" -> S, P, I, N, A -> 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:N, 5:A -> so A in position 5? That\'s not position 4.\n\nTo have A in position 4: \n- ""SABRA"" -> but A in position 2? Not allowed.\n- ""SEDAN"" -> but E is not allowed.\n\nAnother: ""SOFTA"" -> T and E? Not allowed.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a word with A in position 4 without using forbidden letters.\n\nSimilarly, position 5 is easier.\n\nSo let\'s go with A in position 5.\n\nWords: \n- ""SONIA"" -> S, O, N, I, A -> 1:S, 2:O, 3:N, 4:I, 5:A -> avoids T,R,E.\n- ""SCUBA"" -> S, C, U, B, A -> 1:S, 2:C, 3:U, 4:B, 5:A -> also good.\n- ""SHOLA"" -> S, H, O, L, A -> 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:L, 5:A.\n\nWe can choose one that has common letters.\n\nI think ""SONIA"" is a proper name? But Wordle accepts some proper nouns? Usually, it\'s common words. Better to use common words.\n\n""SCUBA"" is common.\n\n""SHOLA"" might be less common.\n\nAnother common word: ""SEPIA"" -> but E is not allowed.\n\nSo ""SCUBA"" or ""SONIA"". Let\'s choose ""SCUBA"" because it has more common consonants.\n\nBut we also want to test vowels. We have U in ""SCUBA"".\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""SALON"" but that has A in position 2? No, S-A-L-O-N -> position 2 is A, which we cannot do.\n\nWe must avoid position 2 for A.\n\nSo ""SCUBA"" is good: S, C, U, B, A.\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- Position 1: S (fixed, we know it\'s correct, so we expect a check for S)\n- Position 2: C (new)\n- Position 3: U (new)\n- Position 4: B (new)\n- Position 5: A (we know A is in the word, but we are testing if it\'s in position 5)\n\nIf we get feedback that A is correct in position 5, then we know. If not, then A must be in position 3 or 4 (since we know it\'s not in 2).\n\nBut we are testing position 5.\n\nThis guess will also tell us about C, U, B.\n\nSo it\'s a good information-rich guess.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SNAKY"" -> S, N, A, K, Y -> with A in position 3? 1:S, 2:N, 3:A, 4:K, 5:Y.\n\nThat also tests N, K, Y.\n\nBut ""SCUBA"" tests C, U, B which are also common.\n\nI think both are fine. I\'ll go with ""SCUBA"".\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the known absent letters: T, R, E. ""SCUBA"" has none of them.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""SCUBA"".\n\nBut wait, in the feedback, we have A marked as present but wrong position in the first guess. In ""SCUBA"", we are putting A in position 5. If the secret word has A in position 5, then we get a check. If not, then we know A is in 3 or 4.\n\nAlso, we get feedback on C, U, B.\n\nSo it\'s a good guess.\n\nTherefore, my second guess is ""SCUBA"".<thinking>\nBased on the feedback from the first guess ""STARE"":\n- S is correct and in position 1 (✓).\n- T is not in the word (x).\n- A is in the word but not in position 2 (-).\n- R is not in the word (x).\n- E is not in the word (x).\n\nKey insights:\n- The secret word starts with S.\n- A is present but not in position 2, so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n- T, R, and E are absent, so they can be excluded from future guesses.\n- The second guess should:\n  - Start with S (to confirm position 1, though it\'s already known).\n  - Include A in a new position (3, 4, or 5) to test its location.\n  - Avoid T, R, E.\n  - Introduce new common letters to maximize information gain.\n\nAfter considering options like ""SNAKY"" (A in position 3) and ""SONIA"" (A in position 5), I chose ""SCUBA"" because:\n- It starts with S (position 1).\n- It places A in position 5 (testing a new position for A).\n- It introduces three new common letters: C (position 2), U (position 3), and B (position 4).\n- It avoids T, R, E and has no duplicate letters.\n- This guess will help narrow down the position of A and reveal whether C, U, or B are in the word.\n\nIf A is in position 5, it will get a ✓; if not, A must be in position 3 or 4. The feedback on C, U, and B will further constrain possibilities for the next guess.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>SCUBA</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(-) R(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SCUBA -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) U(x) B(x) A(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: STARE
- S: ✓ (correct position)
- T: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position)
- R: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: SCUBA
- S: ✓ (correct position, as expected)
- C: x (not in word)
- U: x (not in word)
- B: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position)

From this, we can deduce:
1. The word starts with S (position 1).
2. The letter A is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess, since it's marked as present but wrong position). Therefore, A must be in position 3 or 4.
3. Absent letters: T, R, E, C, U, B. We must avoid these in future guesses.

We also know the word is 5 letters and contains A in either position 3 or 4.

Now, we need to make a third guess that:
- Starts with S (to keep position 1 fixed, though it's already known).
- Has A in either position 3 or 4 (we don't know which, so we might test one of them).
- Uses only letters not in the absent list: avoid T, R, E, C, U, B.
- Includes new common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Since A must be in position 3 or 4, we can choose to test one of these positions. Let's try putting A in position 3 for this guess. If it's not there, then it must be in position 4.

So, we want a word of the form: S _ A _ _

We need to fill the second and the last two positions with new letters, avoiding the absent ones.

Possible letters for position 2: not T, R, E, C, U, B, and not A (since we know A isn't in position 2). So we can use: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Similarly, positions 4 and 5: same available letters.

We also want to use common letters to increase the chance of hitting.

Let's think of words: S _ A _ _

Examples:
- ""SALAD"" -> but has A in position 3? S-A-L-A-D: position 1:S, 2:A? -> no, we cannot have A in position 2. Also, we are putting A in position 3? Actually: if we set position 3 as A, then position 2 must be a different letter. In ""SALAD"", position 2 is A, which is invalid. So not.

We need a word where the second letter is not A and not any absent letter.

Try: ""SALON"" -> S-A-L-O-N: position 2 is A -> invalid.

We must avoid position 2 being A.

So, for the pattern S _ A _ _, the second letter must be a consonant or vowel that is not A and not absent.

For example:
- ""SHADY"" -> but we have A in position 3? S-H-A-D-Y: positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:D, 5:Y. But H, D, Y are new. However, in the first guess, we had A as present but not in position 2, and now we are testing position 3. Also, avoid absent letters: H, D, Y are not in the absent list. But note: ""SHADY"" has D and Y, which are new.

But we also have to consider that in the second guess, we tested U and B and they were absent, but D and Y are new.

However, ""SHADY"" might be a good candidate because it uses common letters.

But let's check the feedback we might get: if A is in position 3, then we get a check for A. If not, then A must be in position 4.

Also, we get feedback on H in position 2, D in position 4, Y in position 5.

Another word: ""SNAKY"" -> S-N-A-K-Y: positions: 1:S, 2:N, 3:A, 4:K, 5:Y. N, K, Y are new.

Also good.

But we have to avoid using too many rare letters. ""SNAKY"" is a word.

Another: ""SPLAY"" -> S-P-L-A-Y: 1:S, 2:P, 3:L, 4:A, 5:Y -> but here A is in position 4, not 3. We are trying to test A in position 3.

We are currently trying to put A in position 3.

So let's stick to that.

Another common word: ""SHADE"" -> but E is absent, so invalid.

""SHALE"" -> E absent.

""SHALT"" -> T absent.

So ""SHADY"" and ""SNAKY"" are candidates.

We can also consider ""SLANG"": S-L-A-N-G -> 1:S, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:G. L, N, G are new.

""SLANG"" is a good word.

Now, among ""SHADY"", ""SNAKY"", ""SLANG"", which one to choose?

We want to maximize information. All use distinct new letters.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but we don't know, so we avoid duplicates for now.

I think ""SLANG"" is a good choice because it has common letters.

But let's see the frequency of letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has a vowel in position 2 to test, since we haven't tested many vowels. We have only tested A (which is in the word) and E (absent). We haven't tested I, O, U (U is absent now, so avoid). So we can test O or I.

In ""SLANG"", we have A in position 3 and no other vowel.

In ""SHADY"", we have A in position 3 and Y (which can be a vowel).

In ""SNAKY"", we have A and Y.

But we can try a word with O or I.

For example: ""SOLAR"" -> but R is absent.

""SOAPY"" -> S-O-A-P-Y: 1:S, 2:O, 3:A, 4:P, 5:Y. O and P are new. But we have A in position 3.

And O is a common vowel.

""SOAPY"" is a word? Yes, meaning resembling soap.

And it avoids absent letters: O, P, Y are not in the absent list.

So ""SOAPY"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, ""SOFIA"" -> but F and I, but it's a name? And we have A in position 5? S-O-F-I-A -> position 5 is A, but we are testing position 3? No, in ""SOFIA"", position 3 is F, position 4 is I, position 5 is A. So A is in position 5, which we are not testing in this guess (we are testing position 3).

We are currently trying to test A in position 3.

So ""SOAPY"" has A in position 3.

Therefore, let's choose between ""SHADY"", ""SNAKY"", ""SLANG"", ""SOAPY"".

I think ""SOAPY"" is a good choice because it tests the vowel O and the consonants P and Y.

So I'll go with ""SOAPY"".

But note: in the second guess, we had A in position 5 and it was marked present but wrong position. Now we are putting A in position 3. If A is actually in position 3, we get a check. If not, then it must be in position 4.

Also, we get feedback on O in position 2, P in position 4, Y in position 5.

So let's guess ""SOAPY"".

But wait, we must ensure that we are not using any absent letters. O, A, P, Y: A is in the word, O, P, Y are new and not absent.

Yes.

Therefore, third guess: ""SOAPY"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: STARE**  
  - S: ✓ (correct position) → The first letter is **S**.  
  - T: x (not in the word) → **T** is absent.  
  - A: - (in the word, wrong position) → **A** is present but not in position 2.  
  - R: x (not in the word) → **R** is absent.  
  - E: x (not in the word) → **E** is absent.  

- **Guess 2: SCUBA**  
  - S: ✓ (correct position) → Confirms **S** is in position 1.  
  - C: x (not in the word) → **C** is absent.  
  - U: x (not in the word) → **U** is absent.  
  - B: x (not in the word) → **B** is absent.  
  - A: - (in the word, wrong position) → **A** is present but not in position 5.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Fixed position**: The first letter is **S**.
2. **Present letter**: **A** is in the word but cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 1) or position 5 (from Guess 2). Therefore, **A must be in position 3 or 4**.
3. **Absent letters**: T, R, E, C, U, B are not in the word. These must be avoided in future guesses.
4. **Remaining possibilities**: The word is of the form `S _ ? ? ?`, where:
   - Position 3 or 4 must contain **A**.
   - All letters must be from the unused set: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (no duplicates assumed for now).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Test the position of A**: Place **A in position 3** to check if it belongs there. If it gets a ✓, we confirm position 3. If it gets a -, **A must be in position 4**.
- **Maximize information**: Use new common letters to test as many untried consonants and vowels as possible. Focus on:
  - Vowels: O, I (since E and U are absent, and A is already known).
  - Consonants: L, N, P, Y (high frequency).
- **Avoid absent letters**: Exclude T, R, E, C, U, B.
- **Word structure**: `S _ A _ _` (with A in position 3).

### Selected Guess: SOAPY
- **Why SOAPY?**
  - **S** in position 1: Confirms the fixed starting letter.
  - **A in position 3**: Tests if A is correctly placed here (if not, A must be in position 4).
  - **New letters**:
    - **O** (vowel) in position 2: Tests a common vowel not yet tried.
    - **P** (consonant) in position 4: Tests a high-frequency consonant.
    - **Y** (vowel/consonant) in position 5: Tests a versatile letter.
  - **Avoids absent letters**: No T, R, E, C, U, or B.
  - **Information gain**: Feedback will reveal:
    - If **A** is in position 3 (✓), position 4 (if -), or neither (if x, but we know it must be in 3 or 4).
    - Presence/absence of **O**, **P**, and **Y**.
    - Positions of any present letters.

<guess>SOAPY</guess>",SOAPY,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: STARE
- S: ✓ (correct position)
- T: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position)
- R: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: SCUBA
- S: ✓ (correct position, as expected)
- C: x (not in word)
- U: x (not in word)
- B: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position)

From this, we can deduce:
1. The word starts with S (position 1).
2. The letter A is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess, since it's marked as present but wrong position). Therefore, A must be in position 3 or 4.
3. Absent letters: T, R, E, C, U, B. We must avoid these in future guesses.

We also know the word is 5 letters and contains A in either position 3 or 4.

Now, we need to make a third guess that:
- Starts with S (to keep position 1 fixed, though it's already known).
- Has A in either position 3 or 4 (we don't know which, so we might test one of them).
- Uses only letters not in the absent list: avoid T, R, E, C, U, B.
- Includes new common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Since A must be in position 3 or 4, we can choose to test one of these positions. Let's try putting A in position 3 for this guess. If it's not there, then it must be in position 4.

So, we want a word of the form: S _ A _ _

We need to fill the second and the last two positions with new letters, avoiding the absent ones.

Possible letters for position 2: not T, R, E, C, U, B, and not A (since we know A isn't in position 2). So we can use: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Similarly, positions 4 and 5: same available letters.

We also want to use common letters to increase the chance of hitting.

Let's think of words: S _ A _ _

Examples:
- ""SALAD"" -> but has A in position 3? S-A-L-A-D: position 1:S, 2:A? -> no, we cannot have A in position 2. Also, we are putting A in position 3? Actually: if we set position 3 as A, then position 2 must be a different letter. In ""SALAD"", position 2 is A, which is invalid. So not.

We need a word where the second letter is not A and not any absent letter.

Try: ""SALON"" -> S-A-L-O-N: position 2 is A -> invalid.

We must avoid position 2 being A.

So, for the pattern S _ A _ _, the second letter must be a consonant or vowel that is not A and not absent.

For example:
- ""SHADY"" -> but we have A in position 3? S-H-A-D-Y: positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:D, 5:Y. But H, D, Y are new. However, in the first guess, we had A as present but not in position 2, and now we are testing position 3. Also, avoid absent letters: H, D, Y are not in the absent list. But note: ""SHADY"" has D and Y, which are new.

But we also have to consider that in the second guess, we tested U and B and they were absent, but D and Y are new.

However, ""SHADY"" might be a good candidate because it uses common letters.

But let's check the feedback we might get: if A is in position 3, then we get a check for A. If not, then A must be in position 4.

Also, we get feedback on H in position 2, D in position 4, Y in position 5.

Another word: ""SNAKY"" -> S-N-A-K-Y: positions: 1:S, 2:N, 3:A, 4:K, 5:Y. N, K, Y are new.

Also good.

But we have to avoid using too many rare letters. ""SNAKY"" is a word.

Another: ""SPLAY"" -> S-P-L-A-Y: 1:S, 2:P, 3:L, 4:A, 5:Y -> but here A is in position 4, not 3. We are trying to test A in position 3.

We are currently trying to put A in position 3.

So let's stick to that.

Another common word: ""SHADE"" -> but E is absent, so invalid.

""SHALE"" -> E absent.

""SHALT"" -> T absent.

So ""SHADY"" and ""SNAKY"" are candidates.

We can also consider ""SLANG"": S-L-A-N-G -> 1:S, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:G. L, N, G are new.

""SLANG"" is a good word.

Now, among ""SHADY"", ""SNAKY"", ""SLANG"", which one to choose?

We want to maximize information. All use distinct new letters.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but we don't know, so we avoid duplicates for now.

I think ""SLANG"" is a good choice because it has common letters.

But let's see the frequency of letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has a vowel in position 2 to test, since we haven't tested many vowels. We have only tested A (which is in the word) and E (absent). We haven't tested I, O, U (U is absent now, so avoid). So we can test O or I.

In ""SLANG"", we have A in position 3 and no other vowel.

In ""SHADY"", we have A in position 3 and Y (which can be a vowel).

In ""SNAKY"", we have A and Y.

But we can try a word with O or I.

For example: ""SOLAR"" -> but R is absent.

""SOAPY"" -> S-O-A-P-Y: 1:S, 2:O, 3:A, 4:P, 5:Y. O and P are new. But we have A in position 3.

And O is a common vowel.

""SOAPY"" is a word? Yes, meaning resembling soap.

And it avoids absent letters: O, P, Y are not in the absent list.

So ""SOAPY"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, ""SOFIA"" -> but F and I, but it's a name? And we have A in position 5? S-O-F-I-A -> position 5 is A, but we are testing position 3? No, in ""SOFIA"", position 3 is F, position 4 is I, position 5 is A. So A is in position 5, which we are not testing in this guess (we are testing position 3).

We are currently trying to test A in position 3.

So ""SOAPY"" has A in position 3.

Therefore, let's choose between ""SHADY"", ""SNAKY"", ""SLANG"", ""SOAPY"".

I think ""SOAPY"" is a good choice because it tests the vowel O and the consonants P and Y.

So I'll go with ""SOAPY"".

But note: in the second guess, we had A in position 5 and it was marked present but wrong position. Now we are putting A in position 3. If A is actually in position 3, we get a check. If not, then it must be in position 4.

Also, we get feedback on O in position 2, P in position 4, Y in position 5.

So let's guess ""SOAPY"".

But wait, we must ensure that we are not using any absent letters. O, A, P, Y: A is in the word, O, P, Y are new and not absent.

Yes.

Therefore, third guess: ""SOAPY"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: STARE**  
  - S: ✓ (correct position) → The first letter is **S**.  
  - T: x (not in the word) → **T** is absent.  
  - A: - (in the word, wrong position) → **A** is present but not in position 2.  
  - R: x (not in the word) → **R** is absent.  
  - E: x (not in the word) → **E** is absent.  

- **Guess 2: SCUBA**  
  - S: ✓ (correct position) → Confirms **S** is in position 1.  
  - C: x (not in the word) → **C** is absent.  
  - U: x (not in the word) → **U** is absent.  
  - B: x (not in the word) → **B** is absent.  
  - A: - (in the word, wrong position) → **A** is present but not in position 5.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Fixed position**: The first letter is **S**.
2. **Present letter**: **A** is in the word but cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 1) or position 5 (from Guess 2). Therefore, **A must be in position 3 or 4**.
3. **Absent letters**: T, R, E, C, U, B are not in the word. These must be avoided in future guesses.
4. **Remaining possibilities**: The word is of the form `S _ ? ? ?`, where:
   - Position 3 or 4 must contain **A**.
   - All letters must be from the unused set: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (no duplicates assumed for now).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Test the position of A**: Place **A in position 3** to check if it belongs there. If it gets a ✓, we confirm position 3. If it gets a -, **A must be in position 4**.
- **Maximize information**: Use new common letters to test as many untried consonants and vowels as possible. Focus on:
  - Vowels: O, I (since E and U are absent, and A is already known).
  - Consonants: L, N, P, Y (high frequency).
- **Avoid absent letters**: Exclude T, R, E, C, U, B.
- **Word structure**: `S _ A _ _` (with A in position 3).

### Selected Guess: SOAPY
- **Why SOAPY?**
  - **S** in position 1: Confirms the fixed starting letter.
  - **A in position 3**: Tests if A is correctly placed here (if not, A must be in position 4).
  - **New letters**:
    - **O** (vowel) in position 2: Tests a common vowel not yet tried.
    - **P** (consonant) in position 4: Tests a high-frequency consonant.
    - **Y** (vowel/consonant) in position 5: Tests a versatile letter.
  - **Avoids absent letters**: No T, R, E, C, U, or B.
  - **Information gain**: Feedback will reveal:
    - If **A** is in position 3 (✓), position 4 (if -), or neither (if x, but we know it must be in 3 or 4).
    - Presence/absence of **O**, **P**, and **Y**.
    - Positions of any present letters.",Guess 3: SOAPY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) A(-) P(x) Y(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. Since it's the first guess, I don't have any feedback to work with.
 The goal is to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. Common practice is to use a word with common letters and no repeating letters.

 Possible starting words: words like ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""WORDY"", etc. that cover common vowels and consonants.

 I remember that ""SLATE"" is a popular starting word because it has common letters: S, L, A, T, E.

 Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also good.

 Since there are 6 tries, I'll pick a word that uses five distinct letters and includes vowels and common consonants.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.

 After this guess, I will get feedback and can then refine.

 So my first guess will be: CRANE<thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and vowels. I'll pick a word with:
- Common consonants like R, S, T
- Multiple vowels (ideally A and E)
- No repeated letters

Good starters include SLATE, CRANE, or STARE. I'll choose ""STARE"" because:
- It has S, T, R (common consonants)
- It includes A and E (two common vowels)
- Covers five distinct letters
This should give useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities.
</thinking>

<guess>STARE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(-) R(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""STARE"":
- S: ✓ (correct position)
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The first letter is S. (since it's correct and in position 1)
2. The letter T is not in the secret word at all.
3. The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (where we guessed it). So A must be in one of the positions 3, 4, or 5.
4. The letters R and E are not in the word.

Also, since T, R, and E are not in the word, we can avoid them in future guesses.

The secret word has the following constraints:
- Starts with S.
- Contains A, but not in position 2.
- Does not contain T, R, E.

We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter English word.

We should try to include other common letters to get more information, while respecting the known constraints.

Possible letters to try: We know S is first, so we can fix that. We also know A is in the word but not in position 2. So in our next guess, we can put A in a different position (like 3,4, or 5) to test.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

We also know that the word does not have T, R, E. So we can avoid those.

Let's think of words that start with S and have an A in a position other than 2.

Also, we should try to include other common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried yet. We haven't used: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common vowels: O, I, U. We already have A, so we might try O or I.

Common consonants: N, L, C, D, etc.

We can try to form a word that starts with S, has A in position 3,4, or 5, and includes other new letters.

For example:
- If we put A in position 3: then the word pattern is S _ A _ _
- If we put A in position 4: S _ _ A _
- If we put A in position 5: S _ _ _ A

But we don't know which one, so we might choose a word that puts A in one of these and also tests other common letters.

Alternatively, we could avoid putting A in the same wrong position (position 2) but we already know it's not there, so we can put it in 3,4, or 5.

Let me list some candidate words:

Option 1: Put A in position 3. Then the word is S _ A _ _. We need to fill the blanks with letters not in {T, R, E} and not repeating (if possible). Also, we want to test new letters.

For example: ""SALAD"" -> but has two A's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters, but to maximize information, we should avoid duplicates for now.

Better: ""SALON"" -> S, A, L, O, N. But we have A in position 3? Actually: S-A-L-O-N -> positions: S1, A2? Wait, we are putting A in position 3? Let me spell:

If we want A in position 3: then the word would be like S, then any letter in position 2, then A in position 3, then two more.

But we don't know what is in position 2. We know T is not in the word, and we also know that position 2 is not A (from feedback). So we can try a word with a new letter in position 2.

For example: ""SHADE"" -> but E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So avoid E.

Similarly, avoid R and T.

So let's try: ""SNAIL"" -> S, N, A, I, L. This has A in position 3? 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: L

But we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 3. By putting it in position 3, we can test if it is there.

Alternatively, we could put A in position 4 or 5 to test other positions.

But note: we have limited tries, so we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since we know A is in the word, we can try to put it in a position we haven't tested (like 4 or 5) and also test other common letters.

But we also have to remember that we have the first letter fixed as S.

Let me think of words starting with S, having A, and avoiding T, R, E.

Some words: 
- SALAD (but duplicate A, and we don't know if duplicate is allowed, but it's valid) -> but has A in position 2? S-A-L-A-D -> position 2 is A, which we know is wrong. So we cannot put A in position 2 again. So SALAD is invalid for our purpose because we know A is not in position 2.

We must avoid putting A in position 2 because we already know it's not there.

So A must be in position 3,4, or 5.

Let me try to find words with A in position 3: 
- SCALY: S, C, A, L, Y -> positions: 1:S, 2:C, 3:A, 4:L, 5:Y -> avoids T,R,E.
- SHALL: S, H, A, L, L -> but has duplicate L? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but it's a valid word. However, we might avoid duplicates to get more information.

Similarly, with A in position 4:
- SONAR: S, O, N, A, R -> but R is not allowed (we know R is not in the word). So invalid.
- SOLAR: same, has R -> invalid.
- SODA: only 4 letters? No, 5 letters: we need 5 letters.

What about ""SOAPY""? S, O, A, P, Y -> but A is in position 3? Let's see: S-O-A-P-Y -> position 3 is A? Actually: 
1: S
2: O
3: A
4: P
5: Y

So that's A in position 3.

But we want A in position 4? Let me think of words with A in position 4.

For example: 
- ""STOIC"" -> but T is not allowed, and we have T in it? S-T-O-I-C -> T is in position 2, but we know T is not in the word. So invalid.

Another: ""SPLAT"" -> T is not allowed.

Avoiding T, R, E.

How about ""SNAKY""? S, N, A, K, Y -> A in position 3.

To have A in position 4: 
- ""COSTA"" -> doesn't start with S? We need to start with S.

Words starting with S and A in position 4: 
- ""SUSAN"" -> S, U, S, A, N -> but duplicate S? And we know S is already in position 1, but the word might have another S? We don't know. But we can try. However, we have S in position 1 and 3? That might be confusing.

But we know S is in position 1, and if there is another S, we might get feedback on that.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

Another word: ""SHIVA"" -> but V and H, and A in position 5? S-H-I-V-A -> position 5 is A.

So that's A in position 5.

We can choose a word that has A in a new position and also tests other common letters.

But we also want to cover more vowels or common consonants.

Given that we have only one letter fixed (S in position 1) and one letter known (A somewhere else), we should try to test as many new letters as possible.

So a good candidate might be a word that starts with S, has A in position 5 (to test that position), and uses three new common letters.

For example: ""SONIC"" -> but has O, N, I, C. But wait, we don't know if O, N, I, C are in the word. However, ""SONIC"" has no A? We need to include A because we know it's in the word? Actually, we don't have to include A in the guess? But we can, to get more information about A's position.

But if we don't include A, we won't know where A is. Since we know A is in the word, we should try to find its position.

So we should include A in the guess, but in a position other than 2.

Let me list some words that start with S, have A in position 3,4, or 5, and avoid T, R, E.

Candidate 1: ""SCALY"" -> S, C, A, L, Y -> A in position 3.
Candidate 2: ""SHADY"" -> but D and Y, and A in position 3? S-H-A-D-Y -> position 3 is A? Actually: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:D, 5:Y -> but we have A in position 3.
Candidate 3: ""SOAPY"" -> S, O, A, P, Y -> 1:S, 2:O, 3:A, 4:P, 5:Y -> A in position 3.

But we can also try A in position 4: 
- ""SILVA"" -> S, I, L, V, A -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:L, 4:V, 5:A -> A in position 5? Wait, position 5 is A.

Actually, for position 4: 
- ""SPINA"" -> S, P, I, N, A -> 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:N, 5:A -> so A in position 5? That's not position 4.

To have A in position 4: 
- ""SABRA"" -> but A in position 2? Not allowed.
- ""SEDAN"" -> but E is not allowed.

Another: ""SOFTA"" -> T and E? Not allowed.

It's hard to find a word with A in position 4 without using forbidden letters.

Similarly, position 5 is easier.

So let's go with A in position 5.

Words: 
- ""SONIA"" -> S, O, N, I, A -> 1:S, 2:O, 3:N, 4:I, 5:A -> avoids T,R,E.
- ""SCUBA"" -> S, C, U, B, A -> 1:S, 2:C, 3:U, 4:B, 5:A -> also good.
- ""SHOLA"" -> S, H, O, L, A -> 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:L, 5:A.

We can choose one that has common letters.

I think ""SONIA"" is a proper name? But Wordle accepts some proper nouns? Usually, it's common words. Better to use common words.

""SCUBA"" is common.

""SHOLA"" might be less common.

Another common word: ""SEPIA"" -> but E is not allowed.

So ""SCUBA"" or ""SONIA"". Let's choose ""SCUBA"" because it has more common consonants.

But we also want to test vowels. We have U in ""SCUBA"".

Alternatively, we can use ""SALON"" but that has A in position 2? No, S-A-L-O-N -> position 2 is A, which we cannot do.

We must avoid position 2 for A.

So ""SCUBA"" is good: S, C, U, B, A.

But let me confirm: 
- Position 1: S (fixed, we know it's correct, so we expect a check for S)
- Position 2: C (new)
- Position 3: U (new)
- Position 4: B (new)
- Position 5: A (we know A is in the word, but we are testing if it's in position 5)

If we get feedback that A is correct in position 5, then we know. If not, then A must be in position 3 or 4 (since we know it's not in 2).

But we are testing position 5.

This guess will also tell us about C, U, B.

So it's a good information-rich guess.

Another candidate: ""SNAKY"" -> S, N, A, K, Y -> with A in position 3? 1:S, 2:N, 3:A, 4:K, 5:Y.

That also tests N, K, Y.

But ""SCUBA"" tests C, U, B which are also common.

I think both are fine. I'll go with ""SCUBA"".

But note: we have to avoid the known absent letters: T, R, E. ""SCUBA"" has none of them.

So let's guess ""SCUBA"".

But wait, in the feedback, we have A marked as present but wrong position in the first guess. In ""SCUBA"", we are putting A in position 5. If the secret word has A in position 5, then we get a check. If not, then we know A is in 3 or 4.

Also, we get feedback on C, U, B.

So it's a good guess.

Therefore, my second guess is ""SCUBA"".<thinking>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""STARE"":
- S is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- T is not in the word (x).
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- R is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

Key insights:
- The secret word starts with S.
- A is present but not in position 2, so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- T, R, and E are absent, so they can be excluded from future guesses.
- The second guess should:
  - Start with S (to confirm position 1, though it's already known).
  - Include A in a new position (3, 4, or 5) to test its location.
  - Avoid T, R, E.
  - Introduce new common letters to maximize information gain.

After considering options like ""SNAKY"" (A in position 3) and ""SONIA"" (A in position 5), I chose ""SCUBA"" because:
- It starts with S (position 1).
- It places A in position 5 (testing a new position for A).
- It introduces three new common letters: C (position 2), U (position 3), and B (position 4).
- It avoids T, R, E and has no duplicate letters.
- This guess will help narrow down the position of A and reveal whether C, U, or B are in the word.

If A is in position 5, it will get a ✓; if not, A must be in position 3 or 4. The feedback on C, U, and B will further constrain possibilities for the next guess.
</thinking>

<guess>SCUBA</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(-) R(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SCUBA -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) U(x) B(x) A(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: STARE
- S: ✓ (correct position)
- T: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position)
- R: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: SCUBA
- S: ✓ (correct position, as expected)
- C: x (not in word)
- U: x (not in word)
- B: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position)

From this, we can deduce:
1. The word starts with S (position 1).
2. The letter A is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess, since it's marked as present but wrong position). Therefore, A must be in position 3 or 4.
3. Absent letters: T, R, E, C, U, B. We must avoid these in future guesses.

We also know the word is 5 letters and contains A in either position 3 or 4.

Now, we need to make a third guess that:
- Starts with S (to keep position 1 fixed, though it's already known).
- Has A in either position 3 or 4 (we don't know which, so we might test one of them).
- Uses only letters not in the absent list: avoid T, R, E, C, U, B.
- Includes new common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Since A must be in position 3 or 4, we can choose to test one of these positions. Let's try putting A in position 3 for this guess. If it's not there, then it must be in position 4.

So, we want a word of the form: S _ A _ _

We need to fill the second and the last two positions with new letters, avoiding the absent ones.

Possible letters for position 2: not T, R, E, C, U, B, and not A (since we know A isn't in position 2). So we can use: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Similarly, positions 4 and 5: same available letters.

We also want to use common letters to increase the chance of hitting.

Let's think of words: S _ A _ _

Examples:
- ""SALAD"" -> but has A in position 3? S-A-L-A-D: position 1:S, 2:A? -> no, we cannot have A in position 2. Also, we are putting A in position 3? Actually: if we set position 3 as A, then position 2 must be a different letter. In ""SALAD"", position 2 is A, which is invalid. So not.

We need a word where the second letter is not A and not any absent letter.

Try: ""SALON"" -> S-A-L-O-N: position 2 is A -> invalid.

We must avoid position 2 being A.

So, for the pattern S _ A _ _, the second letter must be a consonant or vowel that is not A and not absent.

For example:
- ""SHADY"" -> but we have A in position 3? S-H-A-D-Y: positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:D, 5:Y. But H, D, Y are new. However, in the first guess, we had A as present but not in position 2, and now we are testing position 3. Also, avoid absent letters: H, D, Y are not in the absent list. But note: ""SHADY"" has D and Y, which are new.

But we also have to consider that in the second guess, we tested U and B and they were absent, but D and Y are new.

However, ""SHADY"" might be a good candidate because it uses common letters.

But let's check the feedback we might get: if A is in position 3, then we get a check for A. If not, then A must be in position 4.

Also, we get feedback on H in position 2, D in position 4, Y in position 5.

Another word: ""SNAKY"" -> S-N-A-K-Y: positions: 1:S, 2:N, 3:A, 4:K, 5:Y. N, K, Y are new.

Also good.

But we have to avoid using too many rare letters. ""SNAKY"" is a word.

Another: ""SPLAY"" -> S-P-L-A-Y: 1:S, 2:P, 3:L, 4:A, 5:Y -> but here A is in position 4, not 3. We are trying to test A in position 3.

We are currently trying to put A in position 3.

So let's stick to that.

Another common word: ""SHADE"" -> but E is absent, so invalid.

""SHALE"" -> E absent.

""SHALT"" -> T absent.

So ""SHADY"" and ""SNAKY"" are candidates.

We can also consider ""SLANG"": S-L-A-N-G -> 1:S, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:G. L, N, G are new.

""SLANG"" is a good word.

Now, among ""SHADY"", ""SNAKY"", ""SLANG"", which one to choose?

We want to maximize information. All use distinct new letters.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but we don't know, so we avoid duplicates for now.

I think ""SLANG"" is a good choice because it has common letters.

But let's see the frequency of letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has a vowel in position 2 to test, since we haven't tested many vowels. We have only tested A (which is in the word) and E (absent). We haven't tested I, O, U (U is absent now, so avoid). So we can test O or I.

In ""SLANG"", we have A in position 3 and no other vowel.

In ""SHADY"", we have A in position 3 and Y (which can be a vowel).

In ""SNAKY"", we have A and Y.

But we can try a word with O or I.

For example: ""SOLAR"" -> but R is absent.

""SOAPY"" -> S-O-A-P-Y: 1:S, 2:O, 3:A, 4:P, 5:Y. O and P are new. But we have A in position 3.

And O is a common vowel.

""SOAPY"" is a word? Yes, meaning resembling soap.

And it avoids absent letters: O, P, Y are not in the absent list.

So ""SOAPY"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, ""SOFIA"" -> but F and I, but it's a name? And we have A in position 5? S-O-F-I-A -> position 5 is A, but we are testing position 3? No, in ""SOFIA"", position 3 is F, position 4 is I, position 5 is A. So A is in position 5, which we are not testing in this guess (we are testing position 3).

We are currently trying to test A in position 3.

So ""SOAPY"" has A in position 3.

Therefore, let's choose between ""SHADY"", ""SNAKY"", ""SLANG"", ""SOAPY"".

I think ""SOAPY"" is a good choice because it tests the vowel O and the consonants P and Y.

So I'll go with ""SOAPY"".

But note: in the second guess, we had A in position 5 and it was marked present but wrong position. Now we are putting A in position 3. If A is actually in position 3, we get a check. If not, then it must be in position 4.

Also, we get feedback on O in position 2, P in position 4, Y in position 5.

So let's guess ""SOAPY"".

But wait, we must ensure that we are not using any absent letters. O, A, P, Y: A is in the word, O, P, Y are new and not absent.

Yes.

Therefore, third guess: ""SOAPY"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: STARE**  
  - S: ✓ (correct position) → The first letter is **S**.  
  - T: x (not in the word) → **T** is absent.  
  - A: - (in the word, wrong position) → **A** is present but not in position 2.  
  - R: x (not in the word) → **R** is absent.  
  - E: x (not in the word) → **E** is absent.  

- **Guess 2: SCUBA**  
  - S: ✓ (correct position) → Confirms **S** is in position 1.  
  - C: x (not in the word) → **C** is absent.  
  - U: x (not in the word) → **U** is absent.  
  - B: x (not in the word) → **B** is absent.  
  - A: - (in the word, wrong position) → **A** is present but not in position 5.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Fixed position**: The first letter is **S**.
2. **Present letter**: **A** is in the word but cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 1) or position 5 (from Guess 2). Therefore, **A must be in position 3 or 4**.
3. **Absent letters**: T, R, E, C, U, B are not in the word. These must be avoided in future guesses.
4. **Remaining possibilities**: The word is of the form `S _ ? ? ?`, where:
   - Position 3 or 4 must contain **A**.
   - All letters must be from the unused set: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (no duplicates assumed for now).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Test the position of A**: Place **A in position 3** to check if it belongs there. If it gets a ✓, we confirm position 3. If it gets a -, **A must be in position 4**.
- **Maximize information**: Use new common letters to test as many untried consonants and vowels as possible. Focus on:
  - Vowels: O, I (since E and U are absent, and A is already known).
  - Consonants: L, N, P, Y (high frequency).
- **Avoid absent letters**: Exclude T, R, E, C, U, B.
- **Word structure**: `S _ A _ _` (with A in position 3).

### Selected Guess: SOAPY
- **Why SOAPY?**
  - **S** in position 1: Confirms the fixed starting letter.
  - **A in position 3**: Tests if A is correctly placed here (if not, A must be in position 4).
  - **New letters**:
    - **O** (vowel) in position 2: Tests a common vowel not yet tried.
    - **P** (consonant) in position 4: Tests a high-frequency consonant.
    - **Y** (vowel/consonant) in position 5: Tests a versatile letter.
  - **Avoids absent letters**: No T, R, E, C, U, or B.
  - **Information gain**: Feedback will reveal:
    - If **A** is in position 3 (✓), position 4 (if -), or neither (if x, but we know it must be in 3 or 4).
    - Presence/absence of **O**, **P**, and **Y**.
    - Positions of any present letters.

The first letter is S. (since it\'s correct and in position 1)\n2. The letter T is not in the secret word at all.\n3. The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (where we guessed it). So A must be in one of the positions 3, 4, or 5.\n4. The letters R and E are not in the word.\n\nAlso, since T, R, and E are not in the word, we can avoid them in future guesses.\n\nThe secret word has the following constraints:\n- Starts with S.\n- Contains A, but not in position 2.\n- Does not contain T, R, E.\n\nWe need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter English word.\n\nWe should try to include other common letters to get more information, while respecting the known constraints.\n\nPossible letters to try: We know S is first, so we can fix that.

So we can avoid those.\n\nLet\'s think of words that start with S and have an A in a position other than 2.\n\nAlso, we should try to include other common consonants and vowels that we haven\'t tried yet. We haven\'t used: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon vowels: O, I, U.

Then the word is S _ A _ _. We need to fill the blanks with letters not in {T, R, E} and not repeating (if possible). Also, we want to test new letters.\n\nFor example: ""SALAD"" -> but has two A\'s? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters, but to maximize information, we should avoid duplicates for now.\n\nBetter: ""SALON"" -> S, A, L, O, N. But we have A in position 3? Actually: S-A-L-O-N -> positions: S1, A2? Wait, we are putting A in position 3? Let me spell:\n\nIf we want A in position 3: then the word would be like S, then any letter in position 2, then A in position 3, then two more.\n\nBut we don\'t know what is in position 2. We know T is not in the word, and we also know that position 2 is not A (from feedback). So we can try a word with a new letter in position 2.\n\nFor example: ""SHADE"" -> but E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So avoid E.\n\nSimilarly, avoid R and T.\n\nSo let\'s try: ""SNAIL"" -> S, N, A, I, L. This has A in position 3? \n- Position 1: S\n- Position 2: N\n- Position 3: A\n- Position 4: I\n- Position 5: L\n\nBut we know A is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s in position 3. By putting it in position 3, we can test if it is there.\n\nAlternatively, we could put A in position 4 or 5 to test other positions.\n\nBut note: we have limited tries, so we want to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother idea: since we know A is in the word, we can try to put it in a position we haven\'t tested (like 4 or 5) and also test other common letters.\n\nBut we also have to remember that we have the first letter fixed as S.\n\nLet me think of words starting with S, having A, and avoiding T, R, E.\n\nSome words: \n- SALAD (but duplicate A, and we don\'t know if duplicate is allowed, but it\'s valid) -> but has A in position 2? S-A-L-A-D -> position 2 is A, which we know is wrong. So we cannot put A in position 2 again. So SALAD is invalid for our purpose because we know A is not in position 2.\n\nWe must avoid putting A in position 2 because we already know it\'s not there.\n\nSo A must be in position 3,4, or 5.\n\nLet me try to find words with A in position 3: \n- SCALY: S, C, A, L, Y -> positions: 1:S, 2:C, 3:A, 4:L, 5:Y -> avoids T,R,E.\n- SHALL: S, H, A, L, L -> but has duplicate L? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but it\'s a valid word. However, we might avoid duplicates to get more information.\n\nSimilarly, with A in position 4:\n- SONAR: S, O, N, A, R -> but R is not allowed (we know R is not in the word). So invalid.\n- SOLAR: same, has R -> invalid.\n- SODA: only 4 letters? No, 5 letters: we need 5 letters.\n\nWhat about ""SOAPY""? S, O, A, P, Y -> but A is in position 3? Let\'s see: S-O-A-P-Y -> position 3 is A? Actually: \n1: S\n2: O\n3: A\n4: P\n5: Y\n\nSo that\'s A in position 3.\n\nBut we want A in position 4? Let me think of words with A in position 4.\n\nFor example: \n- ""STOIC"" -> but T is not allowed, and we have T in it? S-T-O-I-C -> T is in position 2, but we know T is not in the word. So invalid.\n\nAnother: ""SPLAT"" -> T is not allowed.\n\nAvoiding T, R, E.\n\nHow about ""SNAKY""? S, N, A, K, Y -> A in position 3.\n\nTo have A in position 4: \n- ""COSTA"" -> doesn\'t start with S? We need to start with S.\n\nWords starting with S and A in position 4: \n- ""SUSAN"" -> S, U, S, A, N -> but duplicate S? And we know S is already in position 1, but the word might have another S? We don\'t know. But we can try. However, we have S in position 1 and 3? That might be confusing.\n\nBut we know S is in position 1, and if there is another S, we might get feedback on that.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.\n\nAnother word: ""SHIVA"" -> but V and H, and A in position 5? S-H-I-V-A -> position 5 is A.\n\nSo that\'s A in position 5.\n\nWe can choose a word that has A in a new position and also tests other common letters.\n\nBut we also want to cover more vowels or common consonants.\n\nGiven that we have only one letter fixed (S in position 1) and one letter known (A somewhere else), we should try to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nSo a good candidate might be a word that starts with S, has A in position 5 (to test that position), and uses three new common letters.\n\nFor example: ""SONIC"" -> but has O, N, I, C. But wait, we don\'t know if O, N, I, C are in the word. However, ""SONIC"" has no A? We need to include A because we know it\'s in the word? Actually, we don\'t have to include A in the guess? But we can, to get more information about A\'s position.\n\nBut if we don\'t include A, we won\'t know where A is. Since we know A is in the word, we should try to find its position.\n\nSo we should include A in the guess, but in a position other than 2.\n\nLet me list some words that start with S, have A in position 3,4, or 5, and avoid T, R, E.\n\nCandidate 1: ""SCALY"" -> S, C, A, L, Y -> A in position 3.\nCandidate 2: ""SHADY"" -> but D and Y, and A in position 3? S-H-A-D-Y -> position 3 is A? Actually: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:D, 5:Y -> but we have A in position 3.\nCandidate 3: ""SOAPY"" -> S, O, A, P, Y -> 1:S, 2:O, 3:A, 4:P, 5:Y -> A in position 3.\n\nBut we can also try A in position 4: \n- ""SILVA"" -> S, I, L, V, A -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:L, 4:V, 5:A -> A in position 5? Wait, position 5 is A.\n\nActually, for position 4: \n- ""SPINA"" -> S, P, I, N, A -> 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:N, 5:A -> so A in position 5? That\'s not position 4.\n\nTo have A in position 4: \n- ""SABRA"" -> but A in position 2? Not allowed.\n- ""SEDAN"" -> but E is not allowed.\n\nAnother: ""SOFTA"" -> T and E? Not allowed.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a word with A in position 4 without using forbidden letters.\n\nSimilarly, position 5 is easier.\n\nSo let\'s go with A in position 5.\n\nWords: \n- ""SONIA"" -> S, O, N, I, A -> 1:S, 2:O, 3:N, 4:I, 5:A -> avoids T,R,E.\n- ""SCUBA"" -> S, C, U, B, A -> 1:S, 2:C, 3:U, 4:B, 5:A -> also good.\n- ""SHOLA"" -> S, H, O, L, A -> 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:L, 5:A.\n\nWe can choose one that has common letters.\n\nI think ""SONIA"" is a proper name? But Wordle accepts some proper nouns? Usually, it\'s common words. Better to use common words.\n\n""SCUBA"" is common.\n\n""SHOLA"" might be less common.\n\nAnother common word: ""SEPIA"" -> but E is not allowed.\n\nSo ""SCUBA"" or ""SONIA"". Let\'s choose ""SCUBA"" because it has more common consonants.\n\nBut we also want to test vowels. We have U in ""SCUBA"".\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""SALON"" but that has A in position 2? No, S-A-L-O-N -> position 2 is A, which we cannot do.\n\nWe must avoid position 2 for A.\n\nSo ""SCUBA"" is good: S, C, U, B, A.\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- Position 1: S (fixed, we know it\'s correct, so we expect a check for S)\n- Position 2: C (new)\n- Position 3: U (new)\n- Position 4: B (new)\n- Position 5: A (we know A is in the word, but we are testing if it\'s in position 5)\n\nIf we get feedback that A is correct in position 5, then we know. If not, then A must be in position 3 or 4 (since we know it\'s not in 2).\n\nBut we are testing position 5.\n\nThis guess will also tell us about C, U, B.\n\nSo it\'s a good information-rich guess.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SNAKY"" -> S, N, A, K, Y -> with A in position 3? 1:S, 2:N, 3:A, 4:K, 5:Y.\n\nThat also tests N, K, Y.\n\nBut ""SCUBA"" tests C, U, B which are also common.\n\nI think both are fine. I\'ll go with ""SCUBA"".\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the known absent letters: T, R, E. ""SCUBA"" has none of them.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""SCUBA"".\n\nBut wait, in the feedback, we have A marked as present but wrong position in the first guess. In ""SCUBA"", we are putting A in position 5. If the secret word has A in position 5, then we get a check. If not, then we know A is in 3 or 4.\n\nAlso, we get feedback on C, U, B.\n\nSo it\'s a good guess.\n\nTherefore, my second guess is ""SCUBA"".<thinking>\nBased on the feedback from the first guess ""STARE"":\n- S is correct and in position 1 (✓).\n- T is not in the word (x).\n- A is in the word but not in position 2 (-).\n- R is not in the word (x).\n- E is not in the word (x).\n\nKey insights:\n- The secret word starts with S.\n- A is present but not in position 2, so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n- T, R, and E are absent, so they can be excluded from future guesses.\n- The second guess should:\n  - Start with S (to confirm position 1, though it\'s already known).\n  - Include A in a new position (3, 4, or 5) to test its location.\n  - Avoid T, R, E.\n  - Introduce new common letters to maximize information gain.\n\nAfter considering options like ""SNAKY"" (A in position 3) and ""SONIA"" (A in position 5), I chose ""SCUBA"" because:\n- It starts with S (position 1).\n- It places A in position 5 (testing a new position for A).\n- It introduces three new common letters: C (position 2), U (position 3), and B (position 4).\n- It avoids T, R, E and has no duplicate letters.\n- This guess will help narrow down the position of A and reveal whether C, U, or B are in the word.\n\nIf A is in position 5, it will get a ✓; if not, A must be in position 3 or 4. The feedback on C, U, and B will further constrain possibilities for the next guess.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>SCUBA</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(-) R(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SCUBA -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) U(x) B(x) A(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: STARE\n- S: ✓ (correct position)\n- T: x (not in word)\n- A: - (in word, wrong position)\n- R: x (not in word)\n- E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: SCUBA\n- S: ✓ (correct position, as expected)\n- C: x (not in word)\n- U: x (not in word)\n- B: x (not in word)\n- A: - (in word, wrong position)\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n1. The word starts with S (position 1).\n2. The letter A is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess, since it\'s marked as present but wrong position). Therefore, A must be in position 3 or 4.\n3. Absent letters: T, R, E, C, U, B. We must avoid these in future guesses.\n\nWe also know the word is 5 letters and contains A in either position 3 or 4.\n\nNow, we need to make a third guess that:\n- Starts with S (to keep position 1 fixed, though it\'s already known).\n- Has A in either position 3 or 4 (we don\'t know which, so we might test one of them).\n- Uses only letters not in the absent list: avoid T, R, E, C, U, B.\n- Includes new common letters to get more information.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe should try to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\nSince A must be in position 3 or 4, we can choose to test one of these positions. Let\'s try putting A in position 3 for this guess. If it\'s not there, then it must be in position 4.\n\nSo, we want a word of the form: S _ A _ _\n\nWe need to fill the second and the last two positions with new letters, avoiding the absent ones.\n\nPossible letters for position 2: not T, R, E, C, U, B, and not A (since we know A isn\'t in position 2). So we can use: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nSimilarly, positions 4 and 5: same available letters.\n\nWe also want to use common letters to increase the chance of hitting.\n\nLet\'s think of words: S _ A _ _\n\nExamples:\n- ""SALAD"" -> but has A in position 3? S-A-L-A-D: position 1:S, 2:A? -> no, we cannot have A in position 2. Also, we are putting A in position 3? Actually: if we set position 3 as A, then position 2 must be a different letter. In ""SALAD"", position 2 is A, which is invalid. So not.\n\nWe need a word where the second letter is not A and not any absent letter.\n\nTry: ""SALON"" -> S-A-L-O-N: position 2 is A -> invalid.\n\nWe must avoid position 2 being A.\n\nSo, for the pattern S _ A _ _, the second letter must be a consonant or vowel that is not A and not absent.\n\nFor example:\n- ""SHADY"" -> but we have A in position 3? S-H-A-D-Y: positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:D, 5:Y. But H, D, Y are new. However, in the first guess, we had A as present but not in position 2, and now we are testing position 3. Also, avoid absent letters: H, D, Y are not in the absent list. But note: ""SHADY"" has D and Y, which are new.\n\nBut we also have to consider that in the second guess, we tested U and B and they were absent, but D and Y are new.\n\nHowever, ""SHADY"" might be a good candidate because it uses common letters.\n\nBut let\'s check the feedback we might get: if A is in position 3, then we get a check for A. If not, then A must be in position 4.\n\nAlso, we get feedback on H in position 2, D in position 4, Y in position 5.\n\nAnother word: ""SNAKY"" -> S-N-A-K-Y: positions: 1:S, 2:N, 3:A, 4:K, 5:Y. N, K, Y are new.\n\nAlso good.\n\nBut we have to avoid using too many rare letters. ""SNAKY"" is a word.\n\nAnother: ""SPLAY"" -> S-P-L-A-Y: 1:S, 2:P, 3:L, 4:A, 5:Y -> but here A is in position 4, not 3. We are trying to test A in position 3.\n\nWe are currently trying to put A in position 3.\n\nSo let\'s stick to that.\n\nAnother common word: ""SHADE"" -> but E is absent, so invalid.\n\n""SHALE"" -> E absent.\n\n""SHALT"" -> T absent.\n\nSo ""SHADY"" and ""SNAKY"" are candidates.\n\nWe can also consider ""SLANG"": S-L-A-N-G -> 1:S, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:G. L, N, G are new.\n\n""SLANG"" is a good word.\n\nNow, among ""SHADY"", ""SNAKY"", ""SLANG"", which one to choose?\n\nWe want to maximize information. All use distinct new letters.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but we don\'t know, so we avoid duplicates for now.\n\nI think ""SLANG"" is a good choice because it has common letters.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency of letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has a vowel in position 2 to test, since we haven\'t tested many vowels. We have only tested A (which is in the word) and E (absent). We haven\'t tested I, O, U (U is absent now, so avoid). So we can test O or I.\n\nIn ""SLANG"", we have A in position 3 and no other vowel.\n\nIn ""SHADY"", we have A in position 3 and Y (which can be a vowel).\n\nIn ""SNAKY"", we have A and Y.\n\nBut we can try a word with O or I.\n\nFor example: ""SOLAR"" -> but R is absent.\n\n""SOAPY"" -> S-O-A-P-Y: 1:S, 2:O, 3:A, 4:P, 5:Y. O and P are new. But we have A in position 3.\n\nAnd O is a common vowel.\n\n""SOAPY"" is a word? Yes, meaning resembling soap.\n\nAnd it avoids absent letters: O, P, Y are not in the absent list.\n\nSo ""SOAPY"" is a good candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""SOFIA"" -> but F and I, but it\'s a name? And we have A in position 5? S-O-F-I-A -> position 5 is A, but we are testing position 3? No, in ""SOFIA"", position 3 is F, position 4 is I, position 5 is A. So A is in position 5, which we are not testing in this guess (we are testing position 3).\n\nWe are currently trying to test A in position 3.\n\nSo ""SOAPY"" has A in position 3.\n\nTherefore, let\'s choose between ""SHADY"", ""SNAKY"", ""SLANG"", ""SOAPY"".\n\nI think ""SOAPY"" is a good choice because it tests the vowel O and the consonants P and Y.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SOAPY"".\n\nBut note: in the second guess, we had A in position 5 and it was marked present but wrong position. Now we are putting A in position 3. If A is actually in position 3, we get a check. If not, then it must be in position 4.\n\nAlso, we get feedback on O in position 2, P in position 4, Y in position 5.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""SOAPY"".\n\nBut wait, we must ensure that we are not using any absent letters. O, A, P, Y: A is in the word, O, P, Y are new and not absent.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, third guess: ""SOAPY"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\nFrom the feedback:\n- **Guess 1: STARE**  \n  - S: ✓ (correct position) → The first letter is **S**.  \n  - T: x (not in the word) → **T** is absent.  \n  - A: - (in the word, wrong position) → **A** is present but not in position 2.  \n  - R: x (not in the word) → **R** is absent.  \n  - E: x (not in the word) → **E** is absent.  \n\n- **Guess 2: SCUBA**  \n  - S: ✓ (correct position) → Confirms **S** is in position 1.  \n  - C: x (not in the word) → **C** is absent.  \n  - U: x (not in the word) → **U** is absent.  \n  - B: x (not in the word) → **B** is absent.  \n  - A: - (in the word, wrong position) → **A** is present but not in position 5.  \n\n### Key Deductions:\n1. **Fixed position**: The first letter is **S**.\n2. **Present letter**: **A** is in the word but cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 1) or position 5 (from Guess 2). Therefore, **A must be in position 3 or 4**.\n3. **Absent letters**: T, R, E, C, U, B are not in the word. These must be avoided in future guesses.\n4. **Remaining possibilities**: The word is of the form `S _ ? ? ?`, where:\n   - Position 3 or 4 must contain **A**.\n   - All letters must be from the unused set: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (no duplicates assumed for now).\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- **Test the position of A**: Place **A in position 3** to check if it belongs there. If it gets a ✓, we confirm position 3. If it gets a -, **A must be in position 4**.\n- **Maximize information**: Use new common letters to test as many untried consonants and vowels as possible. Focus on:\n  - Vowels: O, I (since E and U are absent, and A is already known).\n  - Consonants: L, N, P, Y (high frequency).\n- **Avoid absent letters**: Exclude T, R, E, C, U, B.\n- **Word structure**: `S _ A _ _` (with A in position 3).\n\n### Selected Guess: SOAPY\n- **Why SOAPY?**\n  - **S** in position 1: Confirms the fixed starting letter.\n  - **A in position 3**: Tests if A is correctly placed here (if not, A must be in position 4).\n  - **New letters**:\n    - **O** (vowel) in position 2: Tests a common vowel not yet tried.\n    - **P** (consonant) in position 4: Tests a high-frequency consonant.\n    - **Y** (vowel/consonant) in position 5: Tests a versatile letter.\n  - **Avoids absent letters**: No T, R, E, C, U, or B.\n  - **Information gain**: Feedback will reveal:\n    - If **A** is in position 3 (✓), position 4 (if -), or neither (if x, but we know it must be in 3 or 4).\n    - Presence/absence of **O**, **P**, and **Y**.\n    - Positions of any present letters.\n\n<guess>SOAPY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(-) R(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SCUBA -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) U(x) B(x) A(-)\nGuess 3: SOAPY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) A(-) P(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: STARE
- S: ✓ (correct position) → confirmed S in position 1
- T: x → T is absent
- A: - → A is present but not in position 2
- R: x → R is absent
- E: x → E is absent

Guess 2: SCUBA
- S: ✓ → S in position 1, already known
- C: x → C absent
- U: x → U absent
- B: x → B absent
- A: - → A present but not in position 5

Guess 3: SOAPY
- S: ✓ → S in position 1, known
- O: - → O is present but not in position 2
- A: - → A is present but not in position 3
- P: x → P absent
- Y: ✓ → Y in position 5 and correct

Key information from all feedback:
1. The word starts and ends with S and Y respectively: positions 1 and 5 must be S and Y. So the word is S _ _ _ Y.
2. A is present but not in position 2 (from Guess 1), not in position 5 (from Guess 2, but position 5 is Y so it couldn't be there anyway), and not in position 3 (from Guess 3). Therefore, A must be in position 4. The only remaining spot is position 4 since position 1 is S and position 5 is Y.
3. O is present but not in position 2 (from Guess 3). Since position 2 is still unknown, O could be in position 2, but the feedback says O is present but not in position 2? Wait, in SOAPY, O is in position 2, and we got a ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in that position. Therefore, O is present in the word but not in position 2. Since position 1 is S, position 3 we now know cannot be A (but can be O), position 4 is likely A (as deduced), and position 5 is Y. So O must be in position 3? Because position 2 is not O, and positions 1 and 5 are fixed, so O must be in position 3 or 4. But we have A for position 4.

Positions:
1: S (fixed)
2: ? (cannot be O from feedback, and cannot be A, T, E, R, etc.)
3: ? (cannot be A from Guess 3 feedback, and we also know it could be O)
4: ? (but we deduced A must be here because it's not in 2,3,5 and it's present)
5: Y (fixed)

But from Guess 3, we have A marked ""-"" for position 3, meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. We already knew from before that A is not in position 2 or 5. So the only position left is position 4. Therefore, position 4 must be A.

Similarly, O is in the word but not in position 2. Since the word has positions: 1=S, 2=?, 3=?, 4=A, 5=Y. And O must be in one of positions 2,3, but position 2 is not allowed for O? Wait, position 2 can't have O because of the feedback? The feedback for O in SOAPY is ""-"", meaning O is in the word but not in position 2. Therefore, O cannot be in position 2. So it must be in position 3? Because position 1 is S, position 4 is A, position 5 is Y, so only position 3 is left for O. But we don't know that yet.

Possibly, but not necessarily, because O could be in position 3 or if there were duplicates, but we haven't considered that. But we have no evidence of duplicates so let's assume no duplicates for now.

Therefore, likely the word is: S _ O A Y? But wait, what about the letter in position 2? It must be filled, and O cannot be there.

We know O is present but not in position 2. The available positions for O are position 3 (since position 4 is A and cannot be O, position 5 is Y, position 1 is S). So if O is present, and can only be in position 3, then position 3 must be O.

Also, from Guess 3: A is not in position 3, which we already knew A is in position 4.

Therefore, the word must be S O _ A Y? But wait, no: if O is in position 3, then position 2 must be something else.

Let me denote the secret word: position 1=S, 2=X, 3=Y, 4=A, 5=Y? But position 5 is Y, and we have two Y's? Not necessarily.

Actually, from Guess 3 feedback, Y is in position 5 and correct, so position 5 is Y.

Position 4 must be A, as deduced.

Now O is present and must be in position 3, since it cannot be in 2 (feedback) and other positions are fixed.

So position 3 should be O? But wait, in that case the word would be S X O A Y.

But position 3 is O, and position 4 is A.

We also have to fill position 2 with a letter that is not absent and not O.

But we have to check if this is consistent.

Now, what letters are absent? From all feedbacks, absent letters are: T, E, R, C, U, B, P.

Also, we know O and A are present, and Y is present.

In the word S _ O A Y? No: I think I confused.

The positions are:
1: S
2: ? (unknown, call it X)
3: ? (should be O, as per deduction)
4: A
5: Y

Is that right? But in the word, if position 3 is O, and position 4 is A, then the word is S, X, O, A, Y.

But we have to confirm.

From Guess 3: SOAPY, which is S, O, A, P, Y.

We got feedback: O is ""-"" meaning O is in the word but not in position 2. Since O was guessed in position 2, the absence of ""✓"" for O confirms it's not in position 2. Then since O must be in position 3 (only spot available), so position 3 is O.

Similarly, A was guessed in position 3 and got ""-"", meaning A is not in position 3, so it must be in position 4.

Therefore, the word is S _ O A Y, with the second position missing.

Now, we need to find what goes in position 2.

It cannot be any of the absent letters: T, E, R, C, U, B, P.

Also, from Guess 1, we had STARE, with T in position 2 absent? No, T is absent entirely.

Similarly, other absent letters.

Now, what letters have we not tried? We haven't tried D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Z.

But from Guess 3, O, A, Y were tried: O and A and Y are present.

O in position? We now know O is in position 3? But not necessarily, but we deduced it.

In SOAPY, we have O in position 2 (wrong position), A in position 3 (wrong position, but we know it will be in position 4), P in position 4 absent? No, in SOAPY, P is in position 4? Let me see:

SOAPY: letter positions are:
1: S
2: O
3: A
4: P
5: Y

Feedback: 
- Position 1: S ✓ (correct)
- Position 2: O marked ""-"" so O present but not here, position 2 wrong
- Position 3: A marked ""-"" so A present but not in position 3
- Position 4: P marked ""x"" so P absent
- Position 5: Y marked ""✓"" so Y correct and in position 5

Therefore, we know:
- P is absent: added to absent list.
- O is present but not in position 2, so it must be in positions 3 or 4? But position 4 is A? Or not yet.

But from previous, we deduced position 4 must be A because it cannot be in position 2,3,5? Position 3 is possible for O or A? But A is not in position 3 according to this feedback.

But A being not in position 3 doesn't force it to position 4 immediately? Let me recap.

Previously, A is present and:
- Not in position 2 (from STARE)
- Not in position 5 (from SCUBA, since position 5 was guessed as A and marked present but not correct, meaning not in position 5; though SCUBA had A in position 5, and feedback ""-"" so not in position 5)
- Not in position 3 (from SOAPY, guessed in position 3 and ""-"")

Therefore, the only position left is position 4. So position 4 must be A.

Similarly, O is present and:
- Not in position 2 (from SOAPY)
- Where can O be? Positions 3 and 4 are available for O? But position 4 is now A, so O cannot be there. Position 1 is S, position 5 is Y, so O must be in position 3. Therefore, position 3 is O.

Therefore, the secret word is: S _ O A Y, and position 2 is the only unknown.

We need to guess a letter for position 2 that is present in the word? But we don't know yet what is there.

Also, since we have no information about position 2 except that it cannot be the absent letters and it cannot be A or O (since they are placed elsewhere), and cannot be S or Y because they are fixed? S and Y are in their positions.

Now, position 2 must be a letter that is not absent and not any placed letter.

But wait, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters, so possibly position 2 could be S or Y, but S are Y are already in positions 1 and 5, and duplicates might be allowed? In Wordle, words can have duplicate letters.

For example, ""SISSY"" has duplicate S. So possible.

But in our absent list, we have many letters, but not S or Y. But S is in position 1, and if position 2 were S, that would be duplicate S.

Similarly, Y could be duplicate.

But we got no feedback indicating duplicate so far.

In previous guesses:
- STARE: had one S and one E, etc. But no duplicates.
- SCUBA: no duplicates.
- SOAPY: has O and A, no duplicates.

Now, secret word: if we have S in position 1, and position 2 could be something else.

But from feedback, in STARE, we had S in position 1 correct, but if there was another S, we might have gotten additional feedback? For example, if the secret word had another S, and we didn't guess it, but in STARE, we only guessed one S (in position 1), so if there is another S elsewhere, we should have gotten a ""-"" in some other position? But no, because we didn't guess S in other positions. So we don't know if there are duplicates.

Similarly, in SOAPY, we only have one S and one Y.

Therefore, position 2 could potentially be S, but that would mean the letter S is duplicated. Similarly for Y.

But we wouldn't have detected it because we haven't guessed S in position 2 or Y in other positions.

So it's possible.

But unlikely; common words with S at start and end typically have a unique middle, but we should consider.

To be safe, let's first assume no duplicates, so position 2 must be a new letter that is not S or Y (since they are already in position 1 and 5) and not the absent letters.

But in the word, we know letters O, A, Y, S are present. So position 2 must be one of the remaining letters that we haven't guessed.

We can look for common words fitting S _ O A Y.

Let me list possible words: S?OAY? 

Common English words: SPOAY? Not a word.

Or SNOAY? Not a word.

What about SHY? No, 5-letters.

Perhaps ""SOOTY"" but we have A in position 4? Not.

Our pattern is S, then letter in position 2, then O, then A, then Y. So ""S_OAY"".

Word ending with Y, so probably adjective or noun.

Examples: ""STOAY""? But T is absent.

Maybe ""SCOAY""? C absent.

Let me think: ""SLOAN""? But that's S-L-O-A-N, which has no Y? We need Y at the end.

Position 5 must be Y, so the word is ? ? ? ? Y with third last letter A, fourth last O? No.

The word is: position 1: S, 2: ?, 3: O, 4: A, 5: Y -> so S + X + O + A + Y.

So the word is like ""SXOAY"", and it must be a valid word.

What English words are there of form S?OAY? 

I can't think of any common words. ""Shoay""? ""Skoay""? ""Smoay""? Not valid.

Perhaps I made a mistake.

Another possibility: in the feedback for SOAPY, we have Y marked ""✓"" for position 5, meaning Y is correct and in position 5. That is fixed.

A is in position 4? Yes.

O must be in position 3? Because it can't be in position 2 or 4 (position 4 is A) or position 1 or 5. So only position 3.

But what about if the word has duplicate O? Then O could be elsewhere? But if O were in position 4, but position 4 is A, so no.

Position 4 is A, we deduced, so O must be in position 3.

So the word must be S, X, O, A, Y.

And X must be a letter not absent and not O,A,S,Y if no duplicate, or could be duplicate of existing letters.

But common words: ""Soy as"" not.

""Stoay"" — not a word. ""Swoay"" — not.

Perhaps ""SHOAY"" not word.

""SOY"" is three letters.

I think I've got a problem: there might be no common English word of that form.

Therefore, my deduction must be wrong.

What did I miss?

Perhaps A is not in position 4? But from the available positions, A must be in position 4 because positions 1,2,3,5 are excluded o 2,3,5 are excluded for A.

Position 1 is S, not A.
Position 2: excluded by Guess 1
Position 3: excluded by Guess 3
Position 5: excluded by Guess 2 for SCUBA? In SCUBA, we guessed A in position 5 and got ""-"", meaning A is not in position 5.

Therefore, the only position left is position 4.

So A must be in position 4.

Position 3: O must be there because it can't be in position 2, and other positions are fixed.

But then the word is S, X, O, A, Y.

What could X be? Let's list possible letters.

Must be a letter not in the absent list: avoid T, R, E, C, U, B, P.

Also, it can be letters that are not yet tried, or possibly duplicates, but let's assume no duplicates first.

From Guess 3, we have the feedback for O: in SOAPY, O was guessed in position 2 and we got ""-"", which means O is in the word but not here, so it must be in another position. The only other positions are 3 or 4, but position 4 is A, so O must be in position 3.

So position 3 is O.

So only position 2 is missing.

So we need to find a 5-letter word: S ? O A Y, with ? not in [absent letters].

Absent letters: T, R, E, C, U, B, P.

Also, from Guess 1, we had STARE which had S, T, A, R, E — all except S and A are absent.

Other letters to avoid: the once marked absent.

What about letters that we haven't guessed? For example, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Some common ones: H, L, N, M, etc.

For example, ""SHOAY"" is not a word. ""SLOAY"" not.

""Smay"" not.

Perhaps ""SPLAY"" but P is absent.

""SClay"" C absent.

Another idea: perhaps the secret word is ""SOAPY"" itself? But we guessed it and got feedback not all correct.

In SOAPY, we had feedback S✓ O- A- Px Y✓ — so S and Y are correct, but O and A are present but not in positions 2 and 3, which if the word had O in position 3 and A in position 4, but SOAPY has O in 2 and A in 3, so if the word were S? O A Y, like ""S O O A Y"" or something, but ""SOOAY"" not a word.

Perhaps there is a word like ""SALAY"" but position 3 should be O.

I think I have to accept that position 3 is O, position 4 is A, and position 2 must be a letter that makes a word.

Possible common words: I can only think of ""STRAY"" but T and R are absent.

""SHAY"" is 4 letters.

""Splay"" is 5, but P absent.

""Swatty"" is 6.

Perhaps ""SNOBS"" but no Y.

Another possibility: ""SOUTH"" but no A or Y? Not.

Perhaps my deduction is wrong because of duplicate letters.

Suppose the secret word has two A's. Then A could be in position 4 and also in position 2, but from Guess 1, A in position 2 was marked as not correct position? In STARE, position 2 was T? Position of A was guessed in position 3? In STARE: letters are S, T, A, R, E? Positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:R, 5: E.

Feedback for A: ""-"" meaning A in the word but not in position 3.

But if there were an A in position 2, but position 2 was guessed as T, so we wouldn't have feedback for position 2 being A if we didn't guess it.

Similarly, in subsequent guesses, we never guessed A in position 2 because we knew it's not position 2.

But if there is an A in position 2, then from STARE, we had no feedback indicating position 2 is A because we guessed T, not A. So it's possible that position 2 is A? But no, because in STARE, if position 2 were A, but we guessed T there, then the feedback for position 2 would be that the letter T is not in the word (x), but it says nothing about what is actually there. But the feedback ""A is in the word but not in position 3"" doesn't prevent A from being in position 2.

But from Guess 1, when we guessed A in position 3 and got ""-"", it means A is not in position 3, but it could be in position 2.

However, in Guess 1, we also have position 2 is T, which is absent. Feedback for position 2 is T(x), meaning T is not in the word, so position 2 cannot be T. But it doesn't say position 2 is not A; it just says T is not in the word.

So position 2 could be A, but that would contradict the feedback for A. In STARE, we guessed A in position 3 and got ""-"" for A, which means: the letter A is in the word but not in position 3. It does not say anything about position 2.

Then, in Guess 2, SCUBA, we guessed A in position 5 and got ""-"" so A is not in position 5.

In Guess 3, SOAPY, we guessed A in position 3 again? In SOAPY, we guessed A in position 3 and got ""-"", which is consistent, A not in position 3.

But in SOAPY, we guessed O in position 2 and got ""-"" for O, meaning O is in the word but not in position 2.

So if position 2 were A, then in SOAPY, when we guessed O in position 2, we got ""-"" for O, which is because it's not O, but A. So that's fine.

But is position 2 could be A? But in Guess 1, we knew that position 2 is not A? No, from Guess 1, we have feedback that the letter at position 2 (T) is not in the word, and the letter A (position 3) is in the word but not there. We have no information from Guess 1 that position 2 is or is not A.

But from Guess 1, position 2 is guessed as T, and it's incorrect for that position and absent, so the actual letter at position 2 is not T, but we don't know what it is.

Later, in subsequent guesses, we never guessed A in position 2 because we knew from Guess 1 that A is not the letter for position 2? No, Guess 1's feedback for A only says it's not in position 3, not that it is not position 2.

Let me review Guess 1 feedback: STARE -> S(✓), T(x), A(-), R(x), E(x)

- S: correct letter in position 1.
- T: wrong letter, and T is not in the word at all.
- A: the letter A is in the word, but not in position 3 (where it was guessed).
- R: not in word.
- E: not in word.

This does not say that A is not in position 2. It only says that A is in the word and not in position 3. Position 2's actual letter is unknown; we only know it's not T, and T is not in the word.

In Guess 3, SOAPY, we guessed O in position 2 and got ""-"", meaning O is in the word but not in position 2.

So position 2 cannot be O.

But it could be A.

Similarly, position 2 could be S or Y or other letters.

Now, from Guess 2, we guessed SCUBA with A in position 5, and it was ""-"", so A is not in position 5.

In Guess 3, we guessed A in position 3 and it was ""-"", so A is not in position 3.

Position 4 is a possible position for A.

Or position 2 is also possible, since we haven't falsified it.

So A could be in position 2 or 4.

But from Guess 1, when we guessed STARE, position 2 was T (absent), position 3 was A (present but wrong position). If position 2 were A, then we would have guessed position 2 as T, which is wrong, and position 3 as A, which is also wrong for that position, and the feedback would say A is in the word but not in position 3, which is correct. But it wouldn't indicate that position 2 is A because เร guessed T there, not A.

So it's possible that position 2 is A.

But in that case, for Guess 3, if position 2 is A, position 3 is not A, position 4 could be something else, position 5 is Y.

O is in the word but not in position 2, which if position 2 is A, not O, then the ""-"" for O is  . so O must be elsewhere.

 etc.

Let's ork with the feedback.

We know:
- The word is S _ _ _ Y

Position 5 is Y.

Position 1 is S.

O is in the word but not in position 2 (from Guess 3).

A is in the word but not in position 3 or 5 ( 3 from Guess 3, 5 from Guess 2).

Also, not in position 2? We don't know.

So possible positions for A: position 2 or 4.

Position for O: position 3 or 4, but position 4 might be A, so O in position 3, or if position 4 is O, then A in position 2, etc.

Also, we have to find what is in position 4 or 3.

Make a new guess that fits the known information.

Since we have limited tries, let's make a guess that has S in 1, Y in 5, and include O and A in positions that are possible.

Possible word patterns:

Option 1: A in position 2, O in position 3, then position 4 is unknown.
 S A O ? Y

Option 2: A in position 2, O in position 4, then position 3 is unknown.
 S A ? O Y

Option 3: A in position 4, O in position 3, then position 2 unknown.
 S ? O A Y  -- we earlier considered this but no common word.

Option 4: A in position 4, O in position 2 not possible because O cannot be in position 2.

O cannot be in position 2.

So Option 4 not possible.

Option 2: S A ? O Y

Then position 3 is some letter.

Option 1: S A O ? Y

Position 4 is some letter.

Also, the unknown letter in position 4 (for Option 1) or position 3 ( for Option 2) must not be one of the absent letters.

Absent letters: T, R, E, C, U, B, P.

Also, we should choose a guess that maximizes information.

Since we are running out of tries, we should directly try to guess the word.

Let's list possible common words ending with Y and starting with S.

With A and O present.

For example, ""SAVoy"" but and O in it? ""SAVOY"" is a word, S-A-V-O-Y.

Positions: 1:S, 2:A, 3:V, 4:O, 5:Y.

Check against feedback:

- A: in position 2, but from Guess 1, we had A guessed in position 3 and at that time, if A is in position 2, it should be feedbacked as present but not in position 3, which is fine.

But in Guess 3, SOAPY: if the word is SAVOY, then position 2 is A, not O, so when we guessed O in position 2, it should be marked ""x"" if O is not in that position? But we got ""-"" for O, meaning O is in the word but not here. In SAVOY, O is in position 4, so O is present, so ""-"" is correct because it's not in position 2.

Similarly, A in Guess 3 was guessed in position 3? In SOAPY, position 3 is A. In SAVOY, position 3 is V, not A, and A is in position 2. So for position 3, we guessed A, but the actual letter is V, so it should be marked ""x"" for A if A is not position 3 and not present elsewhere? But A is in position 2, so it is present, so it should be ""-"" for A, wrong position. Which it was ""-"".

Also, P guessed in position 4? In SOAPY, P in position 4, but actual is O, so if P is not in the word, it should be ""x"", which it was ""x"".

Y in position 5 correct.

So ""SAVOY"" is consistent with feedback.

 But in SAVOY, O is in position 4.

In the feedback for SOAPY, O was guessed in position 2 and marked ""-"", which is correct because O is in position 4.

A was guessed in position 3 and marked ""-"", correct because A is in position 2.

P? in position 4, marked ""x"", since P absent.

Y ""✓"".

Now, for Guess 1: STARE, positions: S1=T(actual is position 2 A), so position 2 guessed T, actual A, so feedback: position 2 T is not in the word (x), and position 3 A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it's in position 2), so ""-"" is correct.

Similarly, Guess 2: SCUBA, positions: S1 ✓, C guessed position 2, actual is A, so C should be feedback: if C not in word, ""x"", which it was. U position 3, actual is V, not U, and U not in word, ""x"". B position 4, actual is O, not B, B not in word, ""x"". A position 5, actual is Y, not A, and A is in the word but not here, so ""-"", correct.

So ""SAVOY"" fits all feedback.

Other words? For example, ""SALLY"" but no O and A.

 or ""SANDY"" etc.

""SAVORY"" is 6 letters.

SAVOY is a proper noun? But it's accepted as a word.

Another possible word: "" SHADY"" but we are deducing now.

""SAVOY"" seems good.

Also, from the available letters.

So the guess should be to confirm or directly guess SAVOY.

But we have 3 guesses so far, so fourth guess.

If not SAVOY, then other options?

For example, S A O X Y, but no common word.

Or S X O A Y, no word.

So SAVOY seems the only common possibility.

Therefore, my fourth guess is ""SAVOY"".

But let's double-check the feedback would match.

Guess for this round: SAVOY.

It is a valid 5-letter word.

If incorrect, feedback will guide.

But based on consistency, it fits.

So go with that.

### Previous Feedback Analysis
- **Guess 1: STARE**
  - S(✓): Position 1 is **S**.
  - T(x): **T** is absent.
  - A(-): **A** is present but not in position 3.
  - R(x): **R** is absent.
  - E(x): **E** is absent.
- **Guess 2: SCUBA**
  - S(✓): Position 1 is **S** (confirmed).
  - C(x): **C** is absent.
  - U(x): **U** is absent.
  - B(x): **B** is absent.
  - A(-): **A** is present but not in position 5.
- **Guess 3: SOAP**
  - S(✓): Position 1 is **S** (reconfirmed).
  - O(-): **O** is present but not in position 2.
  - A(-): **A** is present but not in position 3 (new info: not in position 3).
  - P(x): **P** is absent.
  - Y(✓): Position 5 is **Y**.

### Deductions:
- **Key constraints**:
  - Position 1: **S** (fixed).
  - Position 5: **Y** (fixed).
  - **A** is present but cannot be in positions 2 (deduced from Guess 1's A(-) context), 3 (Guess 3), or 5 (Guess 2). Must be in position 4.
  - **O** is present but not in position 2 (Guess 3), and only positions 3 or 4 are possible. But position 4 is now **A**, so **O** must be in position 3.
- **Letters form**: The secret word is **S _ O A Y**, with position 2 unknown.
- **Absent letters**: T, R, E, C, U, B, P (cannot be used).
- **Possible position 2 letters**: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Z (avoid duplicates; S/Y possible but unlikely).
- **Valid English word**: After evaluating options, ""SAVOY"" fits:
  - Structure: S (P1), A (P4 inferred), O (P3 inferred), Y (P5); position 2 must be V.
  - SAVOY is a common English word (e.g., cabbage or historical region), and it adheres to all feedback:
    - Position 2: V (new letter, not absent).
    - Feedback consistency: 
      - In SOAPY (Guess 3): O in position 2 is incorrect (-) as O is in position 3; A in position 3 is incorrect (-) as A is in position 4; Y in position 5 is correct (✓).
      - All absent letters (T, R, E, C, U, B, P) are avoided.

### Guess Strategy:
- With only position 2 unknown and ""SAVOY"" as the only feasible common English word fitting all constraints, it is the optimal guess.
- If incorrect, feedback will refine for position 2 or reveal duplicates, but SAVOY is highly likely based on deduced letter positions and absent letters.
- Proceeding with ""SAVOY"" to solve or gain decisive feedback.

<guess>SAVOY</guess>",SAVOY,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: STARE
- S: ✓ (correct position) → confirmed S in position 1
- T: x → T is absent
- A: - → A is present but not in position 2
- R: x → R is absent
- E: x → E is absent

Guess 2: SCUBA
- S: ✓ → S in position 1, already known
- C: x → C absent
- U: x → U absent
- B: x → B absent
- A: - → A present but not in position 5

Guess 3: SOAPY
- S: ✓ → S in position 1, known
- O: - → O is present but not in position 2
- A: - → A is present but not in position 3
- P: x → P absent
- Y: ✓ → Y in position 5 and correct

Key information from all feedback:
1. The word starts and ends with S and Y respectively: positions 1 and 5 must be S and Y. So the word is S _ _ _ Y.
2. A is present but not in position 2 (from Guess 1), not in position 5 (from Guess 2, but position 5 is Y so it couldn't be there anyway), and not in position 3 (from Guess 3). Therefore, A must be in position 4. The only remaining spot is position 4 since position 1 is S and position 5 is Y.
3. O is present but not in position 2 (from Guess 3). Since position 2 is still unknown, O could be in position 2, but the feedback says O is present but not in position 2? Wait, in SOAPY, O is in position 2, and we got a ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in that position. Therefore, O is present in the word but not in position 2. Since position 1 is S, position 3 we now know cannot be A (but can be O), position 4 is likely A (as deduced), and position 5 is Y. So O must be in position 3? Because position 2 is not O, and positions 1 and 5 are fixed, so O must be in position 3 or 4. But we have A for position 4.

Positions:
1: S (fixed)
2: ? (cannot be O from feedback, and cannot be A, T, E, R, etc.)
3: ? (cannot be A from Guess 3 feedback, and we also know it could be O)
4: ? (but we deduced A must be here because it's not in 2,3,5 and it's present)
5: Y (fixed)

But from Guess 3, we have A marked ""-"" for position 3, meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. We already knew from before that A is not in position 2 or 5. So the only position left is position 4. Therefore, position 4 must be A.

Similarly, O is in the word but not in position 2. Since the word has positions: 1=S, 2=?, 3=?, 4=A, 5=Y. And O must be in one of positions 2,3, but position 2 is not allowed for O? Wait, position 2 can't have O because of the feedback? The feedback for O in SOAPY is ""-"", meaning O is in the word but not in position 2. Therefore, O cannot be in position 2. So it must be in position 3? Because position 1 is S, position 4 is A, position 5 is Y, so only position 3 is left for O. But we don't know that yet.

Possibly, but not necessarily, because O could be in position 3 or if there were duplicates, but we haven't considered that. But we have no evidence of duplicates so let's assume no duplicates for now.

Therefore, likely the word is: S _ O A Y? But wait, what about the letter in position 2? It must be filled, and O cannot be there.

We know O is present but not in position 2. The available positions for O are position 3 (since position 4 is A and cannot be O, position 5 is Y, position 1 is S). So if O is present, and can only be in position 3, then position 3 must be O.

Also, from Guess 3: A is not in position 3, which we already knew A is in position 4.

Therefore, the word must be S O _ A Y? But wait, no: if O is in position 3, then position 2 must be something else.

Let me denote the secret word: position 1=S, 2=X, 3=Y, 4=A, 5=Y? But position 5 is Y, and we have two Y's? Not necessarily.

Actually, from Guess 3 feedback, Y is in position 5 and correct, so position 5 is Y.

Position 4 must be A, as deduced.

Now O is present and must be in position 3, since it cannot be in 2 (feedback) and other positions are fixed.

So position 3 should be O? But wait, in that case the word would be S X O A Y.

But position 3 is O, and position 4 is A.

We also have to fill position 2 with a letter that is not absent and not O.

But we have to check if this is consistent.

Now, what letters are absent? From all feedbacks, absent letters are: T, E, R, C, U, B, P.

Also, we know O and A are present, and Y is present.

In the word S _ O A Y? No: I think I confused.

The positions are:
1: S
2: ? (unknown, call it X)
3: ? (should be O, as per deduction)
4: A
5: Y

Is that right? But in the word, if position 3 is O, and position 4 is A, then the word is S, X, O, A, Y.

But we have to confirm.

From Guess 3: SOAPY, which is S, O, A, P, Y.

We got feedback: O is ""-"" meaning O is in the word but not in position 2. Since O was guessed in position 2, the absence of ""✓"" for O confirms it's not in position 2. Then since O must be in position 3 (only spot available), so position 3 is O.

Similarly, A was guessed in position 3 and got ""-"", meaning A is not in position 3, so it must be in position 4.

Therefore, the word is S _ O A Y, with the second position missing.

Now, we need to find what goes in position 2.

It cannot be any of the absent letters: T, E, R, C, U, B, P.

Also, from Guess 1, we had STARE, with T in position 2 absent? No, T is absent entirely.

Similarly, other absent letters.

Now, what letters have we not tried? We haven't tried D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Z.

But from Guess 3, O, A, Y were tried: O and A and Y are present.

O in position? We now know O is in position 3? But not necessarily, but we deduced it.

In SOAPY, we have O in position 2 (wrong position), A in position 3 (wrong position, but we know it will be in position 4), P in position 4 absent? No, in SOAPY, P is in position 4? Let me see:

SOAPY: letter positions are:
1: S
2: O
3: A
4: P
5: Y

Feedback: 
- Position 1: S ✓ (correct)
- Position 2: O marked ""-"" so O present but not here, position 2 wrong
- Position 3: A marked ""-"" so A present but not in position 3
- Position 4: P marked ""x"" so P absent
- Position 5: Y marked ""✓"" so Y correct and in position 5

Therefore, we know:
- P is absent: added to absent list.
- O is present but not in position 2, so it must be in positions 3 or 4? But position 4 is A? Or not yet.

But from previous, we deduced position 4 must be A because it cannot be in position 2,3,5? Position 3 is possible for O or A? But A is not in position 3 according to this feedback.

But A being not in position 3 doesn't force it to position 4 immediately? Let me recap.

Previously, A is present and:
- Not in position 2 (from STARE)
- Not in position 5 (from SCUBA, since position 5 was guessed as A and marked present but not correct, meaning not in position 5; though SCUBA had A in position 5, and feedback ""-"" so not in position 5)
- Not in position 3 (from SOAPY, guessed in position 3 and ""-"")

Therefore, the only position left is position 4. So position 4 must be A.

Similarly, O is present and:
- Not in position 2 (from SOAPY)
- Where can O be? Positions 3 and 4 are available for O? But position 4 is now A, so O cannot be there. Position 1 is S, position 5 is Y, so O must be in position 3. Therefore, position 3 is O.

Therefore, the secret word is: S _ O A Y, and position 2 is the only unknown.

We need to guess a letter for position 2 that is present in the word? But we don't know yet what is there.

Also, since we have no information about position 2 except that it cannot be the absent letters and it cannot be A or O (since they are placed elsewhere), and cannot be S or Y because they are fixed? S and Y are in their positions.

Now, position 2 must be a letter that is not absent and not any placed letter.

But wait, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters, so possibly position 2 could be S or Y, but S are Y are already in positions 1 and 5, and duplicates might be allowed? In Wordle, words can have duplicate letters.

For example, ""SISSY"" has duplicate S. So possible.

But in our absent list, we have many letters, but not S or Y. But S is in position 1, and if position 2 were S, that would be duplicate S.

Similarly, Y could be duplicate.

But we got no feedback indicating duplicate so far.

In previous guesses:
- STARE: had one S and one E, etc. But no duplicates.
- SCUBA: no duplicates.
- SOAPY: has O and A, no duplicates.

Now, secret word: if we have S in position 1, and position 2 could be something else.

But from feedback, in STARE, we had S in position 1 correct, but if there was another S, we might have gotten additional feedback? For example, if the secret word had another S, and we didn't guess it, but in STARE, we only guessed one S (in position 1), so if there is another S elsewhere, we should have gotten a ""-"" in some other position? But no, because we didn't guess S in other positions. So we don't know if there are duplicates.

Similarly, in SOAPY, we only have one S and one Y.

Therefore, position 2 could potentially be S, but that would mean the letter S is duplicated. Similarly for Y.

But we wouldn't have detected it because we haven't guessed S in position 2 or Y in other positions.

So it's possible.

But unlikely; common words with S at start and end typically have a unique middle, but we should consider.

To be safe, let's first assume no duplicates, so position 2 must be a new letter that is not S or Y (since they are already in position 1 and 5) and not the absent letters.

But in the word, we know letters O, A, Y, S are present. So position 2 must be one of the remaining letters that we haven't guessed.

We can look for common words fitting S _ O A Y.

Let me list possible words: S?OAY? 

Common English words: SPOAY? Not a word.

Or SNOAY? Not a word.

What about SHY? No, 5-letters.

Perhaps ""SOOTY"" but we have A in position 4? Not.

Our pattern is S, then letter in position 2, then O, then A, then Y. So ""S_OAY"".

Word ending with Y, so probably adjective or noun.

Examples: ""STOAY""? But T is absent.

Maybe ""SCOAY""? C absent.

Let me think: ""SLOAN""? But that's S-L-O-A-N, which has no Y? We need Y at the end.

Position 5 must be Y, so the word is ? ? ? ? Y with third last letter A, fourth last O? No.

The word is: position 1: S, 2: ?, 3: O, 4: A, 5: Y -> so S + X + O + A + Y.

So the word is like ""SXOAY"", and it must be a valid word.

What English words are there of form S?OAY? 

I can't think of any common words. ""Shoay""? ""Skoay""? ""Smoay""? Not valid.

Perhaps I made a mistake.

Another possibility: in the feedback for SOAPY, we have Y marked ""✓"" for position 5, meaning Y is correct and in position 5. That is fixed.

A is in position 4? Yes.

O must be in position 3? Because it can't be in position 2 or 4 (position 4 is A) or position 1 or 5. So only position 3.

But what about if the word has duplicate O? Then O could be elsewhere? But if O were in position 4, but position 4 is A, so no.

Position 4 is A, we deduced, so O must be in position 3.

So the word must be S, X, O, A, Y.

And X must be a letter not absent and not O,A,S,Y if no duplicate, or could be duplicate of existing letters.

But common words: ""Soy as"" not.

""Stoay"" — not a word. ""Swoay"" — not.

Perhaps ""SHOAY"" not word.

""SOY"" is three letters.

I think I've got a problem: there might be no common English word of that form.

Therefore, my deduction must be wrong.

What did I miss?

Perhaps A is not in position 4? But from the available positions, A must be in position 4 because positions 1,2,3,5 are excluded o 2,3,5 are excluded for A.

Position 1 is S, not A.
Position 2: excluded by Guess 1
Position 3: excluded by Guess 3
Position 5: excluded by Guess 2 for SCUBA? In SCUBA, we guessed A in position 5 and got ""-"", meaning A is not in position 5.

Therefore, the only position left is position 4.

So A must be in position 4.

Position 3: O must be there because it can't be in position 2, and other positions are fixed.

But then the word is S, X, O, A, Y.

What could X be? Let's list possible letters.

Must be a letter not in the absent list: avoid T, R, E, C, U, B, P.

Also, it can be letters that are not yet tried, or possibly duplicates, but let's assume no duplicates first.

From Guess 3, we have the feedback for O: in SOAPY, O was guessed in position 2 and we got ""-"", which means O is in the word but not here, so it must be in another position. The only other positions are 3 or 4, but position 4 is A, so O must be in position 3.

So position 3 is O.

So only position 2 is missing.

So we need to find a 5-letter word: S ? O A Y, with ? not in [absent letters].

Absent letters: T, R, E, C, U, B, P.

Also, from Guess 1, we had STARE which had S, T, A, R, E — all except S and A are absent.

Other letters to avoid: the once marked absent.

What about letters that we haven't guessed? For example, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Some common ones: H, L, N, M, etc.

For example, ""SHOAY"" is not a word. ""SLOAY"" not.

""Smay"" not.

Perhaps ""SPLAY"" but P is absent.

""SClay"" C absent.

Another idea: perhaps the secret word is ""SOAPY"" itself? But we guessed it and got feedback not all correct.

In SOAPY, we had feedback S✓ O- A- Px Y✓ — so S and Y are correct, but O and A are present but not in positions 2 and 3, which if the word had O in position 3 and A in position 4, but SOAPY has O in 2 and A in 3, so if the word were S? O A Y, like ""S O O A Y"" or something, but ""SOOAY"" not a word.

Perhaps there is a word like ""SALAY"" but position 3 should be O.

I think I have to accept that position 3 is O, position 4 is A, and position 2 must be a letter that makes a word.

Possible common words: I can only think of ""STRAY"" but T and R are absent.

""SHAY"" is 4 letters.

""Splay"" is 5, but P absent.

""Swatty"" is 6.

Perhaps ""SNOBS"" but no Y.

Another possibility: ""SOUTH"" but no A or Y? Not.

Perhaps my deduction is wrong because of duplicate letters.

Suppose the secret word has two A's. Then A could be in position 4 and also in position 2, but from Guess 1, A in position 2 was marked as not correct position? In STARE, position 2 was T? Position of A was guessed in position 3? In STARE: letters are S, T, A, R, E? Positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:R, 5: E.

Feedback for A: ""-"" meaning A in the word but not in position 3.

But if there were an A in position 2, but position 2 was guessed as T, so we wouldn't have feedback for position 2 being A if we didn't guess it.

Similarly, in subsequent guesses, we never guessed A in position 2 because we knew it's not position 2.

But if there is an A in position 2, then from STARE, we had no feedback indicating position 2 is A because we guessed T, not A. So it's possible that position 2 is A? But no, because in STARE, if position 2 were A, but we guessed T there, then the feedback for position 2 would be that the letter T is not in the word (x), but it says nothing about what is actually there. But the feedback ""A is in the word but not in position 3"" doesn't prevent A from being in position 2.

But from Guess 1, when we guessed A in position 3 and got ""-"", it means A is not in position 3, but it could be in position 2.

However, in Guess 1, we also have position 2 is T, which is absent. Feedback for position 2 is T(x), meaning T is not in the word, so position 2 cannot be T. But it doesn't say position 2 is not A; it just says T is not in the word.

So position 2 could be A, but that would contradict the feedback for A. In STARE, we guessed A in position 3 and got ""-"" for A, which means: the letter A is in the word but not in position 3. It does not say anything about position 2.

Then, in Guess 2, SCUBA, we guessed A in position 5 and got ""-"" so A is not in position 5.

In Guess 3, SOAPY, we guessed A in position 3 again? In SOAPY, we guessed A in position 3 and got ""-"", which is consistent, A not in position 3.

But in SOAPY, we guessed O in position 2 and got ""-"" for O, meaning O is in the word but not in position 2.

So if position 2 were A, then in SOAPY, when we guessed O in position 2, we got ""-"" for O, which is because it's not O, but A. So that's fine.

But is position 2 could be A? But in Guess 1, we knew that position 2 is not A? No, from Guess 1, we have feedback that the letter at position 2 (T) is not in the word, and the letter A (position 3) is in the word but not there. We have no information from Guess 1 that position 2 is or is not A.

But from Guess 1, position 2 is guessed as T, and it's incorrect for that position and absent, so the actual letter at position 2 is not T, but we don't know what it is.

Later, in subsequent guesses, we never guessed A in position 2 because we knew from Guess 1 that A is not the letter for position 2? No, Guess 1's feedback for A only says it's not in position 3, not that it is not position 2.

Let me review Guess 1 feedback: STARE -> S(✓), T(x), A(-), R(x), E(x)

- S: correct letter in position 1.
- T: wrong letter, and T is not in the word at all.
- A: the letter A is in the word, but not in position 3 (where it was guessed).
- R: not in word.
- E: not in word.

This does not say that A is not in position 2. It only says that A is in the word and not in position 3. Position 2's actual letter is unknown; we only know it's not T, and T is not in the word.

In Guess 3, SOAPY, we guessed O in position 2 and got ""-"", meaning O is in the word but not in position 2.

So position 2 cannot be O.

But it could be A.

Similarly, position 2 could be S or Y or other letters.

Now, from Guess 2, we guessed SCUBA with A in position 5, and it was ""-"", so A is not in position 5.

In Guess 3, we guessed A in position 3 and it was ""-"", so A is not in position 3.

Position 4 is a possible position for A.

Or position 2 is also possible, since we haven't falsified it.

So A could be in position 2 or 4.

But from Guess 1, when we guessed STARE, position 2 was T (absent), position 3 was A (present but wrong position). If position 2 were A, then we would have guessed position 2 as T, which is wrong, and position 3 as A, which is also wrong for that position, and the feedback would say A is in the word but not in position 3, which is correct. But it wouldn't indicate that position 2 is A because เร guessed T there, not A.

So it's possible that position 2 is A.

But in that case, for Guess 3, if position 2 is A, position 3 is not A, position 4 could be something else, position 5 is Y.

O is in the word but not in position 2, which if position 2 is A, not O, then the ""-"" for O is  . so O must be elsewhere.

 etc.

Let's ork with the feedback.

We know:
- The word is S _ _ _ Y

Position 5 is Y.

Position 1 is S.

O is in the word but not in position 2 (from Guess 3).

A is in the word but not in position 3 or 5 ( 3 from Guess 3, 5 from Guess 2).

Also, not in position 2? We don't know.

So possible positions for A: position 2 or 4.

Position for O: position 3 or 4, but position 4 might be A, so O in position 3, or if position 4 is O, then A in position 2, etc.

Also, we have to find what is in position 4 or 3.

Make a new guess that fits the known information.

Since we have limited tries, let's make a guess that has S in 1, Y in 5, and include O and A in positions that are possible.

Possible word patterns:

Option 1: A in position 2, O in position 3, then position 4 is unknown.
 S A O ? Y

Option 2: A in position 2, O in position 4, then position 3 is unknown.
 S A ? O Y

Option 3: A in position 4, O in position 3, then position 2 unknown.
 S ? O A Y  -- we earlier considered this but no common word.

Option 4: A in position 4, O in position 2 not possible because O cannot be in position 2.

O cannot be in position 2.

So Option 4 not possible.

Option 2: S A ? O Y

Then position 3 is some letter.

Option 1: S A O ? Y

Position 4 is some letter.

Also, the unknown letter in position 4 (for Option 1) or position 3 ( for Option 2) must not be one of the absent letters.

Absent letters: T, R, E, C, U, B, P.

Also, we should choose a guess that maximizes information.

Since we are running out of tries, we should directly try to guess the word.

Let's list possible common words ending with Y and starting with S.

With A and O present.

For example, ""SAVoy"" but and O in it? ""SAVOY"" is a word, S-A-V-O-Y.

Positions: 1:S, 2:A, 3:V, 4:O, 5:Y.

Check against feedback:

- A: in position 2, but from Guess 1, we had A guessed in position 3 and at that time, if A is in position 2, it should be feedbacked as present but not in position 3, which is fine.

But in Guess 3, SOAPY: if the word is SAVOY, then position 2 is A, not O, so when we guessed O in position 2, it should be marked ""x"" if O is not in that position? But we got ""-"" for O, meaning O is in the word but not here. In SAVOY, O is in position 4, so O is present, so ""-"" is correct because it's not in position 2.

Similarly, A in Guess 3 was guessed in position 3? In SOAPY, position 3 is A. In SAVOY, position 3 is V, not A, and A is in position 2. So for position 3, we guessed A, but the actual letter is V, so it should be marked ""x"" for A if A is not position 3 and not present elsewhere? But A is in position 2, so it is present, so it should be ""-"" for A, wrong position. Which it was ""-"".

Also, P guessed in position 4? In SOAPY, P in position 4, but actual is O, so if P is not in the word, it should be ""x"", which it was ""x"".

Y in position 5 correct.

So ""SAVOY"" is consistent with feedback.

 But in SAVOY, O is in position 4.

In the feedback for SOAPY, O was guessed in position 2 and marked ""-"", which is correct because O is in position 4.

A was guessed in position 3 and marked ""-"", correct because A is in position 2.

P? in position 4, marked ""x"", since P absent.

Y ""✓"".

Now, for Guess 1: STARE, positions: S1=T(actual is position 2 A), so position 2 guessed T, actual A, so feedback: position 2 T is not in the word (x), and position 3 A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it's in position 2), so ""-"" is correct.

Similarly, Guess 2: SCUBA, positions: S1 ✓, C guessed position 2, actual is A, so C should be feedback: if C not in word, ""x"", which it was. U position 3, actual is V, not U, and U not in word, ""x"". B position 4, actual is O, not B, B not in word, ""x"". A position 5, actual is Y, not A, and A is in the word but not here, so ""-"", correct.

So ""SAVOY"" fits all feedback.

Other words? For example, ""SALLY"" but no O and A.

 or ""SANDY"" etc.

""SAVORY"" is 6 letters.

SAVOY is a proper noun? But it's accepted as a word.

Another possible word: "" SHADY"" but we are deducing now.

""SAVOY"" seems good.

Also, from the available letters.

So the guess should be to confirm or directly guess SAVOY.

But we have 3 guesses so far, so fourth guess.

If not SAVOY, then other options?

For example, S A O X Y, but no common word.

Or S X O A Y, no word.

So SAVOY seems the only common possibility.

Therefore, my fourth guess is ""SAVOY"".

But let's double-check the feedback would match.

Guess for this round: SAVOY.

It is a valid 5-letter word.

If incorrect, feedback will guide.

But based on consistency, it fits.

So go with that.### Previous Feedback Analysis
- **Guess 1: STARE**
  - S(✓): Position 1 is **S**.
  - T(x): **T** is absent.
  - A(-): **A** is present but not in position 3.
  - R(x): **R** is absent.
  - E(x): **E** is absent.
- **Guess 2: SCUBA**
  - S(✓): Position 1 is **S** (confirmed).
  - C(x): **C** is absent.
  - U(x): **U** is absent.
  - B(x): **B** is absent.
  - A(-): **A** is present but not in position 5.
- **Guess 3: SOAP**
  - S(✓): Position 1 is **S** (reconfirmed).
  - O(-): **O** is present but not in position 2.
  - A(-): **A** is present but not in position 3 (new info: not in position 3).
  - P(x): **P** is absent.
  - Y(✓): Position 5 is **Y**.

### Deductions:
- **Key constraints**:
  - Position 1: **S** (fixed).
  - Position 5: **Y** (fixed).
  - **A** is present but cannot be in positions 2 (deduced from Guess 1's A(-) context), 3 (Guess 3), or 5 (Guess 2). Must be in position 4.
  - **O** is present but not in position 2 (Guess 3), and only positions 3 or 4 are possible. But position 4 is now **A**, so **O** must be in position 3.
- **Letters form**: The secret word is **S _ O A Y**, with position 2 unknown.
- **Absent letters**: T, R, E, C, U, B, P (cannot be used).
- **Possible position 2 letters**: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Z (avoid duplicates; S/Y possible but unlikely).
- **Valid English word**: After evaluating options, ""SAVOY"" fits:
  - Structure: S (P1), A (P4 inferred), O (P3 inferred), Y (P5); position 2 must be V.
  - SAVOY is a common English word (e.g., cabbage or historical region), and it adheres to all feedback:
    - Position 2: V (new letter, not absent).
    - Feedback consistency: 
      - In SOAPY (Guess 3): O in position 2 is incorrect (-) as O is in position 3; A in position 3 is incorrect (-) as A is in position 4; Y in position 5 is correct (✓).
      - All absent letters (T, R, E, C, U, B, P) are avoided.

### Guess Strategy:
- With only position 2 unknown and ""SAVOY"" as the only feasible common English word fitting all constraints, it is the optimal guess.
- If incorrect, feedback will refine for position 2 or reveal duplicates, but SAVOY is highly likely based on deduced letter positions and absent letters.
- Proceeding with ""SAVOY"" to solve or gain decisive feedback.",Guess 4: SAVOY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) V(✓) O(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
