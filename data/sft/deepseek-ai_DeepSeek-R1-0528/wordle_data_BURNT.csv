We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word that can give us good information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. These are common and it has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for our first guess ""CRANE"":
C(x) - C is not in the secret word.
R(-) - R is in the word but not in the correct position (since the second position was guessed as R, but it's not there).
A(x) - A is not in the word.
N(✓) - N is in the word and in the correct position (fourth position).
E(x) - E is not in the word.

So, we know:
- The fourth letter is N.
- The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position (where we put it in ""crane"").
- The secret word does not contain C, A, or E.

Since R is not in the second position, but it must be somewhere else, and we have the fourth position taken by N.

Let me denote the positions as 1,2,3,4,5.

We know:
Position 4: N

And R is in the word but not at position 2.

We also eliminated C, A, E.

Now, for our next guess, we want to use this information.

We should try to place R in a different position and also include other common letters that haven't been tested.

Since we know that R is in the word, we can try positions 1, 3, or 5 for R. But note, position 4 is N so R cannot be there.

Also, we haven't tested many consonants yet. Common consonants to try: S, T, L, etc.

We should avoid using C, A, E again.

Let me think of words that have:
- N in the fourth position.
- R in the word, but not in the second position (so try R in position 1, 3, or 5).
- And include other new letters.

Possible words:

Option: Put R in the first position? But note that we haven't tested the first position yet.

Example words:
- ""ROUND"": R in first, O (new), U (new), N in fourth, D (new). But we don't know about O, U, D. Also, we don't have information about third position.

But note: the word must have R and N (with N at end? fourth position).

Another idea: We might also consider that the R might be in position 3 or 5.

But let's try to cover more frequent letters.

Common letters: S, T, L, D, etc.

We can try to include T and S, for example.

What about ""PRINT""? But we don't know about P and I and T. However:
- P is new, R would be in position 2? But our feedback said R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, that wouldn't be efficient because we already know it's not there. So we should avoid putting R in position 2.

In fact, in future guesses, we should avoid putting R in position 2.

So ""PRINT"" has R in position 2? Let's see: P R I N T -> position 2 is R. We know R isn't in position 2, so don't put R there.

We need a word that has R not in position 2 and N in position 4.

Possible words:

- ""TRAIN"": T in first, R in second? Oh, position 2 is R again. Avoid.

- ""BRING"": B in first, R in second? Again, avoid position 2 for R.

We need to put R in position 1, 3, or 5.

Option: ""WRONG"": W in first, R in second? Again position 2.

Let me list words with N in fourth position and R somewhere else.

Common words:
- ""HORNS"": H O R N S -> R in third? That could be. But we don't know about H, O, S.
  Positions: 1:H, 2:O, 3:R, 4:N, 5:S

In ""HORNS"", R is in third position. We haven't tested position 3 yet.

But note: in our feedback we had R(-) meaning R is in the word but not in the second position. It could be in position 3.

But let's think of a word that tests more letters.

Another example: ""BORON"" — not common, two O's? Better to avoid duplicates until we know.

We might also want to test vowels because we have not tested every vowel. We know the word doesn't have A or E, so vowels left: I, O, U.

We tested A and E, so vowels available: I, O, U.

We might need to test one of them.

But consonants we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

That's many. We should focus on high-frequency letters.

Common letters: S, T, L, R (we know R), D, M, etc.

So a good next guess might be:
- Include R in a new position (say position 1, 3, or 5)
- Include N in position 4
- Avoid letters C, A, E
- Test S and T as they are common

Example: Let's try R in the first position.

What about ""ROTAN""? Is that a word? Not really. Check ""ROBIN"": R O B I N -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:B, 4:I, 5:N -> but wait, we need position 4 to be N. In ""ROBIN"", position 4 is I? Let me spell: R O B I N -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:B, 4:I, 5:N -> so the fourth letter is I, not N. That doesn't place N in position 4.

We need the fourth letter to be N.

Another word: ""URBAN"": U R B A N -> but A is eliminated? We know A is not in the word, so no.

We need: ...N at position 4.

Words that end with N? Not necessarily, since fourth position for a five-letter word is second from last.

So pattern: ? ? ? N ?

We know R is present and not in second position.

Let me try to think of words that fit:

Common words with N in fourth: 
- ""LEARN"": L E A R N -> but E and A are eliminated, so no.
- ""BRAIN"": B R A I N -> again, A eliminated, and R in second? Avoid position 2.

Consider ""IRONY"": I R O N Y -> positions: 1:I, 2:R (R in second, avoid), 3:O, 4:N, 5:Y -> but R is in second.

But we must avoid putting R in second.

So how about ""CORNY""? C O R N Y -> C is eliminated? We know C is not in word. And R in third? Positions: 1:C (eliminated), 2:O, 3:R, 4:N, 5:Y. But C is eliminated so I can't use this.

Another: ""HORNY""? H O R N Y -> similar to above without C. But H, O, R, N, Y.

We haven't tested H, O, Y.

But R is in third position? That is position 3.

So: ""HORNY"" -> H in first, O in second, R in third, N in fourth, Y in fifth.

That seems plausible.

However, note we don't want to duplicate the mistake of putting R in second? And here we avoid second for R? Position 3 is new.

But ""horny"" might be offensive? Avoid that.

Instead, let me pick a less controversial word: How about ""BORIN""? Not a word.

""TORAN"" — not common.

Another word: ""GIRON""? Not common.

How about ""STERN"": but E is eliminated. And S T E R N -> fourth letter is R? Positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:R, 5:N -> wait, fourth is R, but we need fourth to be N. So no.

I want the fourth letter to be N.

Common words: ""BEGIN"": B E G I N -> E eliminated. ""BEGIN"" positions: 1:B, 2:E (eliminated), 3:G, 4:I, 5:N -> fourth is I? Not N.

Where is N? Fifth.

We need fourth to be N.

List of common five-letter words with N in fourth position:
- ""URBAN"": U R B A N -> A eliminated.
- ""AARON"": A eliminated and R in position 2 and 4? Complicated.
- ""BAKER"": no N.

Better to think of words that end with ""ON"", meaning fourth letter O? But we need N in fourth.

Pattern: word ending with a vowel and then N? Rare.

Common pattern:  words ending in ""IN"", ""AN"" etc, but we need fourth letter N so word ending in ?N? so fifth letter comes after.

Examples: 
- ""FROWN"": F R O W N -> N is fifth? No: positions:1:F,2:R,3:O,4:W,5:N -> fourth is W? No.

""FROWN"" have fourth letter W? Then N is fifth.

I need fourth letter to be N.

Perhaps: 
- ""BEADN"" not a word.
- ""LEMON"": L E M O N -> E eliminated? Positions:1:L,2:E,3:M,4:O,5:N -> fourth is O? Not N.

Another: ""CROON"": C R O O N -> C eliminated, and duplicates.

""GRAND"": G R A N D -> A eliminated? 

Maybe we need a vowel in the middle? 

Wait, consider: ""PLAIN"": P L A I N -> A eliminated? 

""TRUIN"" not word.

Actually, words like ""STAIN"", ""BRAIN"", ""TRAIN"", ""GRAIN"" have A and we know position 4? No, in ""BRAIN"": B R A I N -> position 4: I, position 5:N.

So position 4 is the letter before last.

Thus to have fourth letter N, we need a word that ends with a consonant after N? So fifth letter must be a consonant? Or vowel? Doesn't matter.

But common words with fourth letter N:
- ""OWNED"": O W N E D -> E eliminated? Positions:1:O,2:W,3:N? Wait: O W N E D -> so position 3 is N? No: 
O(1), W(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) — position 4 is E? We need position 4 to be N.

Perhaps I'm misspelling.

Standard five-letter words: 
- ""ALIGN"": A L I G N -> positions:1:A,2:L,3:I,4:G,5:N -> position 4 is G? Not what we want.
- ""ASIAN"": A S I A N -> position 4:A, position 5:N.

That's not helping.

I recall: In ""CRANE"", we had N in fourth? C R A N E — position 4 is N. Yes.

So we need words with similar pattern.

Other words: ""SHOWN"": S H O W N -> positions:1:S,2:H,3:O,4:W,5:N -> fourth is W? 

""GROAN"": G R O A N -> A eliminated? 

We need to find a word that has the fourth letter N and does not contain A,E,C, and has R in a position that is not 2.

Let me search for such words:

Possible word: ""BORON""? Not common.

""MINOR"": M I N O R — ah! Here: M(1), I(2), N(3), O(4), R(5) — position 4 is O? Not N.

How about ""MANOR"": M A N O R — A eliminated? And position 3 is N? 

MANOR: positions: 1:M, 2:A (eliminated), 3:N, 4:O, 5:R

Position 3 is N? We are supposed to have N at position 4? This is confusing.

In ""crane"", the positions are:
C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)
And we got N(✓) so secret word has N in position 4.

For ""manor"", the N is in position 3, not 4.

What we need is a word e.g. ending with ""ON"" does not work? No, need fourth letter N.

For example, ""BURN"": only four letters.

Valid word: ""BRINK"": B R I N K -> but R in position 2? Avoid.

Positions: B(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), K(5)

So fourth is N? Yes.

But R is in position 2, which we want to avoid because we know R isn't at position 2.

Similarly, ""CRINK"" not a word.

""TREND"": T R E N D -> E eliminated? And fourth letter: T(1), R(2), E(3), N(4), D(5) — so fourth is N? But E eliminated.

""PRANK"": P R A N K — A eliminated.

How about ""PRIED""? No N.

Another common word with N in fourth: ""BLANK"": B L A N K — A eliminated.

""THONG"": T H O N G — positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:O, 4:N, 5:G — yes, fourth is N.

So word: THONG. And it does not contain A,E,C? T,H,O,N,G — yes.

And R? We know there is an R in the secret word. So THONG doesn't have R? So we cannot guess a word without R because we know R is present.

We must include R in our guess if possible to test it.

Our guess should include R? Not necessarily, because we might break it into two steps, but but it's better to include R to find its position.

So in this guess, we should include R to find where it is.

Therefore, we need a word that:
- Has R (in position 1,3, or 5)
- Has N in position 4
- Avoids letters C, A, E
- Tests new letters.

Let me think of such a word:

""BORNE"": B O R N E -> E eliminated? Positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:R, 4:N, 5:E — E eliminated.

""FORUM"": no N.

""WORDY"": no N.

How about ""MOURN"": M O U R N — positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:U, 4:R, 5:N -> fourth is R? But we need fourth to be N? Fifth is N.

Not it.

""AWARD"": not.

Another try: ""BIGRN"" not word.

Perhaps change the order? Let me try R in first or third.

Try R in first: ""R???N"" but the fourth is the fourth position.

So ""R _ _ _ N"" — that we have fifth letter N? No, we need fourth letter to be N, so fifth can be anything.

If fourth letter is N, the word is like: ? ? ? N ?

To have R in the word, put R in position 1: R ? ? N ?
Or position 3: ? ? R N ?
Or position 5: ? ? ? N R

But avoid position 2.

So possibilities:
- R at position 1: e.g. ""ROBIN"" — wait ""ROBIN"" is R O B I N — position 4 is I, not N.

""RAINY"": R A I N Y — A eliminated? And position 4 is N? Rainy: R(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5) — yes, N at 4, but A is in second position? But A is eliminated. So no.

""ROWDY"": R O W D Y — no N.

""ROYAL"": no N.

""RESIN"": R E S I N — E eliminated.

R at position 3: ? ? R N ?

Example: ""BARON"" — B A R O N — A eliminated? 
""BIRTH"": no N.
""BURNT"": B U R N T — U is new, N at fourth? B(1),U(2),R(3),N(4),T(5) — yes.

So ""BURNT"": letters B, U, R, N, T.
U is a vowel we haven't tested.
Avoids A, E, C.
And R is at position 3 — new position! 
N is at position 4 as required.

This seems like a good guess.

Also, it tests B, U, R, N, T — we know R and N, so tests B, U, T.

If U is not in word, it'll be eliminated.

So let's go with ""BURNT"".

But ""BURNT"" is a valid english word.

Alternatively, ""CURNT"" not a word.

""FURN"" too short.

""TURNS"": T U R N S — N is at position 4? T(1),U(2),R(3),N(4),S(5) — yes, but in ""TURNS"", position 4 is N, and R at position 3.

And letters: T, U, R, N, S.

We could test S as well.

Both are valid. ""BURNT"" and ""TURNS"".

But ""BURNT"" has T at the end, which is common.

Also, ""BURNT"" avoids S, in case we want to test S separately.

Or ""TURNS"" tests S.

Since S is very common, it might be good to test it.

""TURNS"" also has U, which we haven't tested.

Which is better?

Let me compare: ""BURNT"" vs ""TURNS"".
Commonness: both are fine.

But in ""BURNT"", B is less common than T? T is more common.

To get more coverage, ""TURNS"" might be better because T and S are very common.

But we already know N is in, R is in.

""TURNS"": T, U, R, N, S. Letters: new are T, U, S.

""BURNT"": B, U, R, N, T. new are B, U, T.

S is higher frequency than B? Yes.

But using ""TURNS"" would test S and T and U.

In the feedback for CRANE, we had no S or T.

So likely the word does not require S or T? But we don't know.

Actually, we should test high-frequency letters.

S is very common, so ""TURNS"" might be better.

Similarly, I can consider ""TURNS"".

But ""TURNS"" has R at position 3 and N at position 4.

It also avoids position 2 for R.

And the second position is U, a vowel.

So I'll go with ""turns"".

But let's confirm: Is ""turns"" valid? Yes.

So guess: ""turns"".

But we will get feedback on each letter.

<guess>turns</guess>

But earlier I thought about BURNT too.

I think ""TURNS"" is a good choice.

So I will guess ""TURNS"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is not in the word (x).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is not in the word (x).
- N is in the word and in position 4 (✓).
- E is not in the word (x).

Key insights:
- The secret word must have R, but not in position 2.
- The fourth letter is N.
- C, A, and E are not in the word.
- For the next guess, prioritize:
  - Including R in a new position (position 1, 3, or 5).
  - Keeping N in position 4.
  - Testing new common letters (avoiding C, A, E) and vowels like I, O, U.
  - Covering high-frequency consonants like S, T, and L.

After evaluating options, a suitable guess is ""turns"":
- Puts R in position 3 (new position, avoiding position 2).
- Keeps N in position 4.
- Tests new letters: T (common consonant), U (untested vowel), and S (high-frequency consonant).
- Avoids C, A, E.

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities while leveraging known constraints.

<guess>turns</guess>",turns,"We are given feedback for our first guess ""CRANE"":
C(x) - C is not in the secret word.
R(-) - R is in the word but not in the correct position (since the second position was guessed as R, but it's not there).
A(x) - A is not in the word.
N(✓) - N is in the word and in the correct position (fourth position).
E(x) - E is not in the word.

So, we know:
- The fourth letter is N.
- The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position (where we put it in ""crane"").
- The secret word does not contain C, A, or E.

Since R is not in the second position, but it must be somewhere else, and we have the fourth position taken by N.

Let me denote the positions as 1,2,3,4,5.

We know:
Position 4: N

And R is in the word but not at position 2.

We also eliminated C, A, E.

Now, for our next guess, we want to use this information.

We should try to place R in a different position and also include other common letters that haven't been tested.

Since we know that R is in the word, we can try positions 1, 3, or 5 for R. But note, position 4 is N so R cannot be there.

Also, we haven't tested many consonants yet. Common consonants to try: S, T, L, etc.

We should avoid using C, A, E again.

Let me think of words that have:
- N in the fourth position.
- R in the word, but not in the second position (so try R in position 1, 3, or 5).
- And include other new letters.

Possible words:

Option: Put R in the first position? But note that we haven't tested the first position yet.

Example words:
- ""ROUND"": R in first, O (new), U (new), N in fourth, D (new). But we don't know about O, U, D. Also, we don't have information about third position.

But note: the word must have R and N (with N at end? fourth position).

Another idea: We might also consider that the R might be in position 3 or 5.

But let's try to cover more frequent letters.

Common letters: S, T, L, D, etc.

We can try to include T and S, for example.

What about ""PRINT""? But we don't know about P and I and T. However:
- P is new, R would be in position 2? But our feedback said R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, that wouldn't be efficient because we already know it's not there. So we should avoid putting R in position 2.

In fact, in future guesses, we should avoid putting R in position 2.

So ""PRINT"" has R in position 2? Let's see: P R I N T -> position 2 is R. We know R isn't in position 2, so don't put R there.

We need a word that has R not in position 2 and N in position 4.

Possible words:

- ""TRAIN"": T in first, R in second? Oh, position 2 is R again. Avoid.

- ""BRING"": B in first, R in second? Again, avoid position 2 for R.

We need to put R in position 1, 3, or 5.

Option: ""WRONG"": W in first, R in second? Again position 2.

Let me list words with N in fourth position and R somewhere else.

Common words:
- ""HORNS"": H O R N S -> R in third? That could be. But we don't know about H, O, S.
  Positions: 1:H, 2:O, 3:R, 4:N, 5:S

In ""HORNS"", R is in third position. We haven't tested position 3 yet.

But note: in our feedback we had R(-) meaning R is in the word but not in the second position. It could be in position 3.

But let's think of a word that tests more letters.

Another example: ""BORON"" — not common, two O's? Better to avoid duplicates until we know.

We might also want to test vowels because we have not tested every vowel. We know the word doesn't have A or E, so vowels left: I, O, U.

We tested A and E, so vowels available: I, O, U.

We might need to test one of them.

But consonants we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

That's many. We should focus on high-frequency letters.

Common letters: S, T, L, R (we know R), D, M, etc.

So a good next guess might be:
- Include R in a new position (say position 1, 3, or 5)
- Include N in position 4
- Avoid letters C, A, E
- Test S and T as they are common

Example: Let's try R in the first position.

What about ""ROTAN""? Is that a word? Not really. Check ""ROBIN"": R O B I N -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:B, 4:I, 5:N -> but wait, we need position 4 to be N. In ""ROBIN"", position 4 is I? Let me spell: R O B I N -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:B, 4:I, 5:N -> so the fourth letter is I, not N. That doesn't place N in position 4.

We need the fourth letter to be N.

Another word: ""URBAN"": U R B A N -> but A is eliminated? We know A is not in the word, so no.

We need: ...N at position 4.

Words that end with N? Not necessarily, since fourth position for a five-letter word is second from last.

So pattern: ? ? ? N ?

We know R is present and not in second position.

Let me try to think of words that fit:

Common words with N in fourth: 
- ""LEARN"": L E A R N -> but E and A are eliminated, so no.
- ""BRAIN"": B R A I N -> again, A eliminated, and R in second? Avoid position 2.

Consider ""IRONY"": I R O N Y -> positions: 1:I, 2:R (R in second, avoid), 3:O, 4:N, 5:Y -> but R is in second.

But we must avoid putting R in second.

So how about ""CORNY""? C O R N Y -> C is eliminated? We know C is not in word. And R in third? Positions: 1:C (eliminated), 2:O, 3:R, 4:N, 5:Y. But C is eliminated so I can't use this.

Another: ""HORNY""? H O R N Y -> similar to above without C. But H, O, R, N, Y.

We haven't tested H, O, Y.

But R is in third position? That is position 3.

So: ""HORNY"" -> H in first, O in second, R in third, N in fourth, Y in fifth.

That seems plausible.

However, note we don't want to duplicate the mistake of putting R in second? And here we avoid second for R? Position 3 is new.

But ""horny"" might be offensive? Avoid that.

Instead, let me pick a less controversial word: How about ""BORIN""? Not a word.

""TORAN"" — not common.

Another word: ""GIRON""? Not common.

How about ""STERN"": but E is eliminated. And S T E R N -> fourth letter is R? Positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:R, 5:N -> wait, fourth is R, but we need fourth to be N. So no.

I want the fourth letter to be N.

Common words: ""BEGIN"": B E G I N -> E eliminated. ""BEGIN"" positions: 1:B, 2:E (eliminated), 3:G, 4:I, 5:N -> fourth is I? Not N.

Where is N? Fifth.

We need fourth to be N.

List of common five-letter words with N in fourth position:
- ""URBAN"": U R B A N -> A eliminated.
- ""AARON"": A eliminated and R in position 2 and 4? Complicated.
- ""BAKER"": no N.

Better to think of words that end with ""ON"", meaning fourth letter O? But we need N in fourth.

Pattern: word ending with a vowel and then N? Rare.

Common pattern:  words ending in ""IN"", ""AN"" etc, but we need fourth letter N so word ending in ?N? so fifth letter comes after.

Examples: 
- ""FROWN"": F R O W N -> N is fifth? No: positions:1:F,2:R,3:O,4:W,5:N -> fourth is W? No.

""FROWN"" have fourth letter W? Then N is fifth.

I need fourth letter to be N.

Perhaps: 
- ""BEADN"" not a word.
- ""LEMON"": L E M O N -> E eliminated? Positions:1:L,2:E,3:M,4:O,5:N -> fourth is O? Not N.

Another: ""CROON"": C R O O N -> C eliminated, and duplicates.

""GRAND"": G R A N D -> A eliminated? 

Maybe we need a vowel in the middle? 

Wait, consider: ""PLAIN"": P L A I N -> A eliminated? 

""TRUIN"" not word.

Actually, words like ""STAIN"", ""BRAIN"", ""TRAIN"", ""GRAIN"" have A and we know position 4? No, in ""BRAIN"": B R A I N -> position 4: I, position 5:N.

So position 4 is the letter before last.

Thus to have fourth letter N, we need a word that ends with a consonant after N? So fifth letter must be a consonant? Or vowel? Doesn't matter.

But common words with fourth letter N:
- ""OWNED"": O W N E D -> E eliminated? Positions:1:O,2:W,3:N? Wait: O W N E D -> so position 3 is N? No: 
O(1), W(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) — position 4 is E? We need position 4 to be N.

Perhaps I'm misspelling.

Standard five-letter words: 
- ""ALIGN"": A L I G N -> positions:1:A,2:L,3:I,4:G,5:N -> position 4 is G? Not what we want.
- ""ASIAN"": A S I A N -> position 4:A, position 5:N.

That's not helping.

I recall: In ""CRANE"", we had N in fourth? C R A N E — position 4 is N. Yes.

So we need words with similar pattern.

Other words: ""SHOWN"": S H O W N -> positions:1:S,2:H,3:O,4:W,5:N -> fourth is W? 

""GROAN"": G R O A N -> A eliminated? 

We need to find a word that has the fourth letter N and does not contain A,E,C, and has R in a position that is not 2.

Let me search for such words:

Possible word: ""BORON""? Not common.

""MINOR"": M I N O R — ah! Here: M(1), I(2), N(3), O(4), R(5) — position 4 is O? Not N.

How about ""MANOR"": M A N O R — A eliminated? And position 3 is N? 

MANOR: positions: 1:M, 2:A (eliminated), 3:N, 4:O, 5:R

Position 3 is N? We are supposed to have N at position 4? This is confusing.

In ""crane"", the positions are:
C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)
And we got N(✓) so secret word has N in position 4.

For ""manor"", the N is in position 3, not 4.

What we need is a word e.g. ending with ""ON"" does not work? No, need fourth letter N.

For example, ""BURN"": only four letters.

Valid word: ""BRINK"": B R I N K -> but R in position 2? Avoid.

Positions: B(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), K(5)

So fourth is N? Yes.

But R is in position 2, which we want to avoid because we know R isn't at position 2.

Similarly, ""CRINK"" not a word.

""TREND"": T R E N D -> E eliminated? And fourth letter: T(1), R(2), E(3), N(4), D(5) — so fourth is N? But E eliminated.

""PRANK"": P R A N K — A eliminated.

How about ""PRIED""? No N.

Another common word with N in fourth: ""BLANK"": B L A N K — A eliminated.

""THONG"": T H O N G — positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:O, 4:N, 5:G — yes, fourth is N.

So word: THONG. And it does not contain A,E,C? T,H,O,N,G — yes.

And R? We know there is an R in the secret word. So THONG doesn't have R? So we cannot guess a word without R because we know R is present.

We must include R in our guess if possible to test it.

Our guess should include R? Not necessarily, because we might break it into two steps, but but it's better to include R to find its position.

So in this guess, we should include R to find where it is.

Therefore, we need a word that:
- Has R (in position 1,3, or 5)
- Has N in position 4
- Avoids letters C, A, E
- Tests new letters.

Let me think of such a word:

""BORNE"": B O R N E -> E eliminated? Positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:R, 4:N, 5:E — E eliminated.

""FORUM"": no N.

""WORDY"": no N.

How about ""MOURN"": M O U R N — positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:U, 4:R, 5:N -> fourth is R? But we need fourth to be N? Fifth is N.

Not it.

""AWARD"": not.

Another try: ""BIGRN"" not word.

Perhaps change the order? Let me try R in first or third.

Try R in first: ""R???N"" but the fourth is the fourth position.

So ""R _ _ _ N"" — that we have fifth letter N? No, we need fourth letter to be N, so fifth can be anything.

If fourth letter is N, the word is like: ? ? ? N ?

To have R in the word, put R in position 1: R ? ? N ?
Or position 3: ? ? R N ?
Or position 5: ? ? ? N R

But avoid position 2.

So possibilities:
- R at position 1: e.g. ""ROBIN"" — wait ""ROBIN"" is R O B I N — position 4 is I, not N.

""RAINY"": R A I N Y — A eliminated? And position 4 is N? Rainy: R(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5) — yes, N at 4, but A is in second position? But A is eliminated. So no.

""ROWDY"": R O W D Y — no N.

""ROYAL"": no N.

""RESIN"": R E S I N — E eliminated.

R at position 3: ? ? R N ?

Example: ""BARON"" — B A R O N — A eliminated? 
""BIRTH"": no N.
""BURNT"": B U R N T — U is new, N at fourth? B(1),U(2),R(3),N(4),T(5) — yes.

So ""BURNT"": letters B, U, R, N, T.
U is a vowel we haven't tested.
Avoids A, E, C.
And R is at position 3 — new position! 
N is at position 4 as required.

This seems like a good guess.

Also, it tests B, U, R, N, T — we know R and N, so tests B, U, T.

If U is not in word, it'll be eliminated.

So let's go with ""BURNT"".

But ""BURNT"" is a valid english word.

Alternatively, ""CURNT"" not a word.

""FURN"" too short.

""TURNS"": T U R N S — N is at position 4? T(1),U(2),R(3),N(4),S(5) — yes, but in ""TURNS"", position 4 is N, and R at position 3.

And letters: T, U, R, N, S.

We could test S as well.

Both are valid. ""BURNT"" and ""TURNS"".

But ""BURNT"" has T at the end, which is common.

Also, ""BURNT"" avoids S, in case we want to test S separately.

Or ""TURNS"" tests S.

Since S is very common, it might be good to test it.

""TURNS"" also has U, which we haven't tested.

Which is better?

Let me compare: ""BURNT"" vs ""TURNS"".
Commonness: both are fine.

But in ""BURNT"", B is less common than T? T is more common.

To get more coverage, ""TURNS"" might be better because T and S are very common.

But we already know N is in, R is in.

""TURNS"": T, U, R, N, S. Letters: new are T, U, S.

""BURNT"": B, U, R, N, T. new are B, U, T.

S is higher frequency than B? Yes.

But using ""TURNS"" would test S and T and U.

In the feedback for CRANE, we had no S or T.

So likely the word does not require S or T? But we don't know.

Actually, we should test high-frequency letters.

S is very common, so ""TURNS"" might be better.

Similarly, I can consider ""TURNS"".

But ""TURNS"" has R at position 3 and N at position 4.

It also avoids position 2 for R.

And the second position is U, a vowel.

So I'll go with ""turns"".

But let's confirm: Is ""turns"" valid? Yes.

So guess: ""turns"".

But we will get feedback on each letter.

<guess>turns</guess>

But earlier I thought about BURNT too.

I think ""TURNS"" is a good choice.

So I will guess ""TURNS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is not in the word (x).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is not in the word (x).
- N is in the word and in position 4 (✓).
- E is not in the word (x).

Key insights:
- The secret word must have R, but not in position 2.
- The fourth letter is N.
- C, A, and E are not in the word.
- For the next guess, prioritize:
  - Including R in a new position (position 1, 3, or 5).
  - Keeping N in position 4.
  - Testing new common letters (avoiding C, A, E) and vowels like I, O, U.
  - Covering high-frequency consonants like S, T, and L.

After evaluating options, a suitable guess is ""turns"":
- Puts R in position 3 (new position, avoiding position 2).
- Keeps N in position 4.
- Tests new letters: T (common consonant), U (untested vowel), and S (high-frequency consonant).
- Avoids C, A, E.

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities while leveraging known constraints.",Guess 2: turns -> FEEDBACK: T(-) U(✓) R(✓) N(✓) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,BURNT,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word that can give us good information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. These are common and it has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for our first guess ""CRANE"":
C(x) - C is not in the secret word.
R(-) - R is in the word but not in the correct position (since the second position was guessed as R, but it's not there).
A(x) - A is not in the word.
N(✓) - N is in the word and in the correct position (fourth position).
E(x) - E is not in the word.

So, we know:
- The fourth letter is N.
- The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position (where we put it in ""crane"").
- The secret word does not contain C, A, or E.

Since R is not in the second position, but it must be somewhere else, and we have the fourth position taken by N.

Let me denote the positions as 1,2,3,4,5.

We know:
Position 4: N

And R is in the word but not at position 2.

We also eliminated C, A, E.

Now, for our next guess, we want to use this information.

We should try to place R in a different position and also include other common letters that haven't been tested.

Since we know that R is in the word, we can try positions 1, 3, or 5 for R. But note, position 4 is N so R cannot be there.

Also, we haven't tested many consonants yet. Common consonants to try: S, T, L, etc.

We should avoid using C, A, E again.

Let me think of words that have:
- N in the fourth position.
- R in the word, but not in the second position (so try R in position 1, 3, or 5).
- And include other new letters.

Possible words:

Option: Put R in the first position? But note that we haven't tested the first position yet.

Example words:
- ""ROUND"": R in first, O (new), U (new), N in fourth, D (new). But we don't know about O, U, D. Also, we don't have information about third position.

But note: the word must have R and N (with N at end? fourth position).

Another idea: We might also consider that the R might be in position 3 or 5.

But let's try to cover more frequent letters.

Common letters: S, T, L, D, etc.

We can try to include T and S, for example.

What about ""PRINT""? But we don't know about P and I and T. However:
- P is new, R would be in position 2? But our feedback said R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, that wouldn't be efficient because we already know it's not there. So we should avoid putting R in position 2.

In fact, in future guesses, we should avoid putting R in position 2.

So ""PRINT"" has R in position 2? Let's see: P R I N T -> position 2 is R. We know R isn't in position 2, so don't put R there.

We need a word that has R not in position 2 and N in position 4.

Possible words:

- ""TRAIN"": T in first, R in second? Oh, position 2 is R again. Avoid.

- ""BRING"": B in first, R in second? Again, avoid position 2 for R.

We need to put R in position 1, 3, or 5.

Option: ""WRONG"": W in first, R in second? Again position 2.

Let me list words with N in fourth position and R somewhere else.

Common words:
- ""HORNS"": H O R N S -> R in third? That could be. But we don't know about H, O, S.
  Positions: 1:H, 2:O, 3:R, 4:N, 5:S

In ""HORNS"", R is in third position. We haven't tested position 3 yet.

But note: in our feedback we had R(-) meaning R is in the word but not in the second position. It could be in position 3.

But let's think of a word that tests more letters.

Another example: ""BORON"" — not common, two O's? Better to avoid duplicates until we know.

We might also want to test vowels because we have not tested every vowel. We know the word doesn't have A or E, so vowels left: I, O, U.

We tested A and E, so vowels available: I, O, U.

We might need to test one of them.

But consonants we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

That's many. We should focus on high-frequency letters.

Common letters: S, T, L, R (we know R), D, M, etc.

So a good next guess might be:
- Include R in a new position (say position 1, 3, or 5)
- Include N in position 4
- Avoid letters C, A, E
- Test S and T as they are common

Example: Let's try R in the first position.

What about ""ROTAN""? Is that a word? Not really. Check ""ROBIN"": R O B I N -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:B, 4:I, 5:N -> but wait, we need position 4 to be N. In ""ROBIN"", position 4 is I? Let me spell: R O B I N -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:B, 4:I, 5:N -> so the fourth letter is I, not N. That doesn't place N in position 4.

We need the fourth letter to be N.

Another word: ""URBAN"": U R B A N -> but A is eliminated? We know A is not in the word, so no.

We need: ...N at position 4.

Words that end with N? Not necessarily, since fourth position for a five-letter word is second from last.

So pattern: ? ? ? N ?

We know R is present and not in second position.

Let me try to think of words that fit:

Common words with N in fourth: 
- ""LEARN"": L E A R N -> but E and A are eliminated, so no.
- ""BRAIN"": B R A I N -> again, A eliminated, and R in second? Avoid position 2.

Consider ""IRONY"": I R O N Y -> positions: 1:I, 2:R (R in second, avoid), 3:O, 4:N, 5:Y -> but R is in second.

But we must avoid putting R in second.

So how about ""CORNY""? C O R N Y -> C is eliminated? We know C is not in word. And R in third? Positions: 1:C (eliminated), 2:O, 3:R, 4:N, 5:Y. But C is eliminated so I can't use this.

Another: ""HORNY""? H O R N Y -> similar to above without C. But H, O, R, N, Y.

We haven't tested H, O, Y.

But R is in third position? That is position 3.

So: ""HORNY"" -> H in first, O in second, R in third, N in fourth, Y in fifth.

That seems plausible.

However, note we don't want to duplicate the mistake of putting R in second? And here we avoid second for R? Position 3 is new.

But ""horny"" might be offensive? Avoid that.

Instead, let me pick a less controversial word: How about ""BORIN""? Not a word.

""TORAN"" — not common.

Another word: ""GIRON""? Not common.

How about ""STERN"": but E is eliminated. And S T E R N -> fourth letter is R? Positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:R, 5:N -> wait, fourth is R, but we need fourth to be N. So no.

I want the fourth letter to be N.

Common words: ""BEGIN"": B E G I N -> E eliminated. ""BEGIN"" positions: 1:B, 2:E (eliminated), 3:G, 4:I, 5:N -> fourth is I? Not N.

Where is N? Fifth.

We need fourth to be N.

List of common five-letter words with N in fourth position:
- ""URBAN"": U R B A N -> A eliminated.
- ""AARON"": A eliminated and R in position 2 and 4? Complicated.
- ""BAKER"": no N.

Better to think of words that end with ""ON"", meaning fourth letter O? But we need N in fourth.

Pattern: word ending with a vowel and then N? Rare.

Common pattern:  words ending in ""IN"", ""AN"" etc, but we need fourth letter N so word ending in ?N? so fifth letter comes after.

Examples: 
- ""FROWN"": F R O W N -> N is fifth? No: positions:1:F,2:R,3:O,4:W,5:N -> fourth is W? No.

""FROWN"" have fourth letter W? Then N is fifth.

I need fourth letter to be N.

Perhaps: 
- ""BEADN"" not a word.
- ""LEMON"": L E M O N -> E eliminated? Positions:1:L,2:E,3:M,4:O,5:N -> fourth is O? Not N.

Another: ""CROON"": C R O O N -> C eliminated, and duplicates.

""GRAND"": G R A N D -> A eliminated? 

Maybe we need a vowel in the middle? 

Wait, consider: ""PLAIN"": P L A I N -> A eliminated? 

""TRUIN"" not word.

Actually, words like ""STAIN"", ""BRAIN"", ""TRAIN"", ""GRAIN"" have A and we know position 4? No, in ""BRAIN"": B R A I N -> position 4: I, position 5:N.

So position 4 is the letter before last.

Thus to have fourth letter N, we need a word that ends with a consonant after N? So fifth letter must be a consonant? Or vowel? Doesn't matter.

But common words with fourth letter N:
- ""OWNED"": O W N E D -> E eliminated? Positions:1:O,2:W,3:N? Wait: O W N E D -> so position 3 is N? No: 
O(1), W(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) — position 4 is E? We need position 4 to be N.

Perhaps I'm misspelling.

Standard five-letter words: 
- ""ALIGN"": A L I G N -> positions:1:A,2:L,3:I,4:G,5:N -> position 4 is G? Not what we want.
- ""ASIAN"": A S I A N -> position 4:A, position 5:N.

That's not helping.

I recall: In ""CRANE"", we had N in fourth? C R A N E — position 4 is N. Yes.

So we need words with similar pattern.

Other words: ""SHOWN"": S H O W N -> positions:1:S,2:H,3:O,4:W,5:N -> fourth is W? 

""GROAN"": G R O A N -> A eliminated? 

We need to find a word that has the fourth letter N and does not contain A,E,C, and has R in a position that is not 2.

""THONG"": T H O N G — positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:O, 4:N, 5:G — yes, fourth is N.

So word: THONG. And it does not contain A,E,C? T,H,O,N,G — yes.

And R? We know there is an R in the secret word. So THONG doesn't have R? So we cannot guess a word without R because we know R is present.

We must include R in our guess if possible to test it.

Our guess should include R? Not necessarily, because we might break it into two steps, but but it's better to include R to find its position.

So in this guess, we should include R to find where it is.

Therefore, we need a word that:
- Has R (in position 1,3, or 5)
- Has N in position 4
- Avoids letters C, A, E
- Tests new letters.

Let me think of such a word:

""BORNE"": B O R N E -> E eliminated? Positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:R, 4:N, 5:E — E eliminated.

""FORUM"": no N.

""WORDY"": no N.

How about ""MOURN"": M O U R N — positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:U, 4:R, 5:N -> fourth is R? But we need fourth to be N? Fifth is N.

Not it.

""AWARD"": not.

Another try: ""BIGRN"" not word.

Perhaps change the order? Let me try R in first or third.

Try R in first: ""R???N"" but the fourth is the fourth position.

So ""R _ _ _ N"" — that we have fifth letter N? No, we need fourth letter to be N, so fifth can be anything.

If fourth letter is N, the word is like: ? ? ? N ?

To have R in the word, put R in position 1: R ? ? N ?
Or position 3: ? ? R N ?
Or position 5: ? ? ? N R

But avoid position 2.

So possibilities:
- R at position 1: e.g. ""ROBIN"" — wait ""ROBIN"" is R O B I N — position 4 is I, not N.

""RAINY"": R A I N Y — A eliminated? And position 4 is N? Rainy: R(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5) — yes, N at 4, but A is in second position? But A is eliminated. So no.

""ROWDY"": R O W D Y — no N.

""ROYAL"": no N.

""RESIN"": R E S I N — E eliminated.

R at position 3: ? ? R N ?

Example: ""BARON"" — B A R O N — A eliminated? 
""BIRTH"": no N.
""BURNT"": B U R N T — U is new, N at fourth? B(1),U(2),R(3),N(4),T(5) — yes.

So ""BURNT"": letters B, U, R, N, T.
U is a vowel we haven't tested.
Avoids A, E, C.
And R is at position 3 — new position! 
N is at position 4 as required.

This seems like a good guess.

Also, it tests B, U, R, N, T — we know R and N, so tests B, U, T.

If U is not in word, it'll be eliminated.

So let's go with ""BURNT"".

But ""BURNT"" is a valid english word.

Alternatively, ""CURNT"" not a word.

""FURN"" too short.

""TURNS"": T U R N S — N is at position 4? T(1),U(2),R(3),N(4),S(5) — yes, but in ""TURNS"", position 4 is N, and R at position 3.

And letters: T, U, R, N, S.

We could test S as well.

Both are valid. ""BURNT"" and ""TURNS"".

But ""BURNT"" has T at the end, which is common.

Also, ""BURNT"" avoids S, in case we want to test S separately.

Or ""TURNS"" tests S.

Since S is very common, it might be good to test it.

""TURNS"" also has U, which we haven't tested.

Which is better?

Let me compare: ""BURNT"" vs ""TURNS"".
Commonness: both are fine.

But in ""BURNT"", B is less common than T? T is more common.

To get more coverage, ""TURNS"" might be better because T and S are very common.

But we already know N is in, R is in.

""TURNS"": T, U, R, N, S. Letters: new are T, U, S.

""BURNT"": B, U, R, N, T. new are B, U, T.

S is higher frequency than B? Yes.

But using ""TURNS"" would test S and T and U.

In the feedback for CRANE, we had no S or T.

So likely the word does not require S or T? But we don't know.

Actually, we should test high-frequency letters.

S is very common, so ""TURNS"" might be better.

Similarly, I can consider ""TURNS"".

But ""TURNS"" has R at position 3 and N at position 4.

It also avoids position 2 for R.

And the second position is U, a vowel.

So I'll go with ""turns"".

But let's confirm: Is ""turns"" valid? Yes.

So guess: ""turns"".

But we will get feedback on each letter.

<guess>turns</guess>

But earlier I thought about BURNT too.

I think ""TURNS"" is a good choice.

So I will guess ""TURNS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is not in the word (x).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is not in the word (x).
- N is in the word and in position 4 (✓).
- E is not in the word (x).

Key insights:
- The secret word must have R, but not in position 2.
- The fourth letter is N.
- C, A, and E are not in the word.
- For the next guess, prioritize:
  - Including R in a new position (position 1, 3, or 5).
  - Keeping N in position 4.
  - Testing new common letters (avoiding C, A, E) and vowels like I, O, U.
  - Covering high-frequency consonants like S, T, and L.

After evaluating options, a suitable guess is ""turns"":
- Puts R in position 3 (new position, avoiding position 2).
- Keeps N in position 4.
- Tests new letters: T (common consonant), U (untested vowel), and S (high-frequency consonant).
- Avoids C, A, E.

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities while leveraging known constraints.

But note, position 4 is N so R cannot be there.\n\nAlso, we haven\'t tested many consonants yet. Common consonants to try: S, T, L, etc.\n\nWe should avoid using C, A, E again.\n\nLet me think of words that have:\n- N in the fourth position.\n- R in the word, but not in the second position (so try R in position 1, 3, or 5).\n- And include other new letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\nOption: Put R in the first position? But note that we haven\'t tested the first position yet.\n\nExample words:\n- ""ROUND"": R in first, O (new), U (new), N in fourth, D (new). But we don\'t know about O, U, D. Also, we don\'t have information about third position.\n\nBut note: the word must have R and N (with N at end? fourth position).\n\nAnother idea: We might also consider that the R might be in position 3 or 5.\n\nBut let\'s try to cover more frequent letters.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, D, etc.\n\nWe can try to include T and S, for example.\n\nWhat about ""PRINT""? But we don\'t know about P and I and T. However:\n- P is new, R would be in position 2? But our feedback said R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, that wouldn\'t be efficient because we already know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting R in position 2.\n\nIn fact, in future guesses, we should avoid putting R in position 2.\n\nSo ""PRINT"" has R in position 2? Let\'s see: P R I N T -> position 2 is R. We know R isn\'t in position 2, so don\'t put R there.\n\nWe need a word that has R not in position 2 and N in position 4.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""TRAIN"": T in first, R in second? Oh, position 2 is R again. Avoid.\n\n- ""BRING"": B in first, R in second? Again, avoid position 2 for R.\n\nWe need to put R in position 1, 3, or 5.\n\nOption: ""WRONG"": W in first, R in second? Again position 2.\n\nLet me list words with N in fourth position and R somewhere else.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""HORNS"": H O R N S -> R in third? That could be. But we don\'t know about H, O, S.\n  Positions: 1:H, 2:O, 3:R, 4:N, 5:S\n\nIn ""HORNS"", R is in third position. We haven\'t tested position 3 yet.\n\nBut note: in our feedback we had R(-) meaning R is in the word but not in the second position. It could be in position 3.\n\nBut let\'s think of a word that tests more letters.\n\nAnother example: ""BORON"" — not common, two O\'s? Better to avoid duplicates until we know.\n\nWe might also want to test vowels because we have not tested every vowel. We know the word doesn\'t have A or E, so vowels left: I, O, U.\n\nWe tested A and E, so vowels available: I, O, U.\n\nWe might need to test one of them.\n\nBut consonants we haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nThat\'s many. We should focus on high-frequency letters.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, R (we know R), D, M, etc.\n\nSo a good next guess might be:\n- Include R in a new position (say position 1, 3, or 5)\n- Include N in position 4\n- Avoid letters C, A, E\n- Test S and T as they are common\n\nExample: Let\'s try R in the first position.\n\nWhat about ""ROTAN""? Is that a word? Not really. Check ""ROBIN"": R O B I N -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:B, 4:I, 5:N -> but wait, we need position 4 to be N. In ""ROBIN"", position 4 is I? Let me spell: R O B I N -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:B, 4:I, 5:N -> so the fourth letter is I, not N. That doesn\'t place N in position 4.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be N.\n\nAnother word: ""URBAN"": U R B A N -> but A is eliminated? We know A is not in the word, so no.\n\nWe need: ...N at position 4.\n\nWords that end with N? Not necessarily, since fourth position for a five-letter word is second from last.\n\nSo pattern: ? ? ? N ?\n\nWe know R is present and not in second position.\n\nLet me try to think of words that fit:\n\nCommon words with N in fourth: \n- ""LEARN"": L E A R N -> but E and A are eliminated, so no.\n- ""BRAIN"": B R A I N -> again, A eliminated, and R in second? Avoid position 2.\n\nConsider ""IRONY"": I R O N Y -> positions: 1:I, 2:R (R in second, avoid), 3:O, 4:N, 5:Y -> but R is in second.\n\nBut we must avoid putting R in second.\n\nSo how about ""CORNY""? C O R N Y -> C is eliminated? We know C is not in word. And R in third? Positions: 1:C (eliminated), 2:O, 3:R, 4:N, 5:Y. But C is eliminated so I can\'t use this.\n\nAnother: ""HORNY""? H O R N Y -> similar to above without C. But H, O, R, N, Y.\n\nWe haven\'t tested H, O, Y.\n\nBut R is in third position? That is position 3.\n\nSo: ""HORNY"" -> H in first, O in second, R in third, N in fourth, Y in fifth.\n\nThat seems plausible.\n\nHowever, note we don\'t want to duplicate the mistake of putting R in second? And here we avoid second for R? Position 3 is new.\n\nBut ""horny"" might be offensive? Avoid that.\n\nInstead, let me pick a less controversial word: How about ""BORIN""? Not a word.\n\n""TORAN"" — not common.\n\nAnother word: ""GIRON""? Not common.\n\nHow about ""STERN"": but E is eliminated. And S T E R N -> fourth letter is R? Positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:R, 5:N -> wait, fourth is R, but we need fourth to be N. So no.\n\nI want the fourth letter to be N.\n\nCommon words: ""BEGIN"": B E G I N -> E eliminated. ""BEGIN"" positions: 1:B, 2:E (eliminated), 3:G, 4:I, 5:N -> fourth is I? Not N.\n\nWhere is N? Fifth.\n\nWe need fourth to be N.\n\nList of common five-letter words with N in fourth position:\n- ""URBAN"": U R B A N -> A eliminated.\n- ""AARON"": A eliminated and R in position 2 and 4? Complicated.\n- ""BAKER"": no N.\n\nBetter to think of words that end with ""ON"", meaning fourth letter O? But we need N in fourth.\n\nPattern: word ending with a vowel and then N? Rare.\n\nCommon pattern:  words ending in ""IN"", ""AN"" etc, but we need fourth letter N so word ending in ?N? so fifth letter comes after.\n\nExamples: \n- ""FROWN"": F R O W N -> N is fifth? No: positions:1:F,2:R,3:O,4:W,5:N -> fourth is W? No.\n\n""FROWN"" have fourth letter W? Then N is fifth.\n\nI need fourth letter to be N.\n\nPerhaps: \n- ""BEADN"" not a word.\n- ""LEMON"": L E M O N -> E eliminated? Positions:1:L,2:E,3:M,4:O,5:N -> fourth is O? Not N.\n\nAnother: ""CROON"": C R O O N -> C eliminated, and duplicates.\n\n""GRAND"": G R A N D -> A eliminated? \n\nMaybe we need a vowel in the middle? \n\nWait, consider: ""PLAIN"": P L A I N -> A eliminated? \n\n""TRUIN"" not word.\n\nActually, words like ""STAIN"", ""BRAIN"", ""TRAIN"", ""GRAIN"" have A and we know position 4? No, in ""BRAIN"": B R A I N -> position 4: I, position 5:N.\n\nSo position 4 is the letter before last.\n\nThus to have fourth letter N, we need a word that ends with a consonant after N? So fifth letter must be a consonant? Or vowel? Doesn\'t matter.\n\nBut common words with fourth letter N:\n- ""OWNED"": O W N E D -> E eliminated? Positions:1:O,2:W,3:N? Wait: O W N E D -> so position 3 is N? No: \nO(1), W(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) — position 4 is E? We need position 4 to be N.\n\nPerhaps I\'m misspelling.\n\nStandard five-letter words: \n- ""ALIGN"": A L I G N -> positions:1:A,2:L,3:I,4:G,5:N -> position 4 is G? Not what we want.\n- ""ASIAN"": A S I A N -> position 4:A, position 5:N.\n\nThat\'s not helping.\n\nI recall: In ""CRANE"", we had N in fourth? C R A N E — position 4 is N. Yes.\n\nSo we need words with similar pattern.\n\nOther words: ""SHOWN"": S H O W N -> positions:1:S,2:H,3:O,4:W,5:N -> fourth is W? \n\n""GROAN"": G R O A N -> A eliminated? \n\nWe need to find a word that has the fourth letter N and does not contain A,E,C, and has R in a position that is not 2.\n\nLet me search for such words:\n\nPossible word: ""BORON""? Not common.\n\n""MINOR"": M I N O R — ah! Here: M(1), I(2), N(3), O(4), R(5) — position 4 is O? Not N.\n\nHow about ""MANOR"": M A N O R — A eliminated? And position 3 is N? \n\nMANOR: positions: 1:M, 2:A (eliminated), 3:N, 4:O, 5:R\n\nPosition 3 is N? We are supposed to have N at position 4? This is confusing.\n\nIn ""crane"", the positions are:\nC(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)\nAnd we got N(✓) so secret word has N in position 4.\n\nFor ""manor"", the N is in position 3, not 4.\n\nWhat we need is a word e.g. ending with ""ON"" does not work? No, need fourth letter N.\n\nFor example, ""BURN"": only four letters.\n\nValid word: ""BRINK"": B R I N K -> but R in position 2? Avoid.\n\nPositions: B(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), K(5)\n\nSo fourth is N? Yes.\n\nBut R is in position 2, which we want to avoid because we know R isn\'t at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""CRINK"" not a word.\n\n""TREND"": T R E N D -> E eliminated? And fourth letter: T(1), R(2), E(3), N(4), D(5) — so fourth is N? But E eliminated.\n\n""PRANK"": P R A N K — A eliminated.\n\nHow about ""PRIED""? No N.\n\nAnother common word with N in fourth: ""BLANK"": B L A N K — A eliminated.\n\n""THONG"": T H O N G — positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:O, 4:N, 5:G — yes, fourth is N.\n\nSo word: THONG. And it does not contain A,E,C? T,H,O,N,G — yes.\n\nAnd R? We know there is an R in the secret word. So THONG doesn\'t have R? So we cannot guess a word without R because we know R is present.\n\nWe must include R in our guess if possible to test it.\n\nOur guess should include R? Not necessarily, because we might break it into two steps, but but it\'s better to include R to find its position.\n\nSo in this guess, we should include R to find where it is.\n\nTherefore, we need a word that:\n- Has R (in position 1,3, or 5)\n- Has N in position 4\n- Avoids letters C, A, E\n- Tests new letters.\n\nLet me think of such a word:\n\n""BORNE"": B O R N E -> E eliminated? Positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:R, 4:N, 5:E — E eliminated.\n\n""FORUM"": no N.\n\n""WORDY"": no N.\n\nHow about ""MOURN"": M O U R N — positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:U, 4:R, 5:N -> fourth is R? But we need fourth to be N? Fifth is N.\n\nNot it.\n\n""AWARD"": not.\n\nAnother try: ""BIGRN"" not word.\n\nPerhaps change the order? Let me try R in first or third.\n\nTry R in first: ""R???N"" but the fourth is the fourth position.\n\nSo ""R _ _ _ N"" — that we have fifth letter N? No, we need fourth letter to be N, so fifth can be anything.\n\nIf fourth letter is N, the word is like: ? ? ? N ?\n\nTo have R in the word, put R in position 1: R ? ? N ?\nOr position 3: ? ? R N ?\nOr position 5: ? ? ? N R\n\nBut avoid position 2.\n\nSo possibilities:\n- R at position 1: e.g. ""ROBIN"" — wait ""ROBIN"" is R O B I N — position 4 is I, not N.\n\n""RAINY"": R A I N Y — A eliminated? And position 4 is N? Rainy: R(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5) — yes, N at 4, but A is in second position? But A is eliminated. So no.\n\n""ROWDY"": R O W D Y — no N.\n\n""ROYAL"": no N.\n\n""RESIN"": R E S I N — E eliminated.\n\nR at position 3: ? ?

B(1),U(2),R(3),N(4),T(5) — yes.\n\nSo ""BURNT"": letters B, U, R, N, T.\nU is a vowel we haven\'t tested.\nAvoids A, E, C.\nAnd R is at position 3 — new position! \nN is at position 4 as required.\n\nThis seems like a good guess.\n\nAlso, it tests B, U, R, N, T — we know R and N, so tests B, U, T.\n\nIf U is not in word, it\'ll be eliminated.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""BURNT"".\n\nBut ""BURNT"" is a valid english word.\n\nAlternatively, ""CURNT"" not a word.\n\n""FURN"" too short.\n\n""TURNS"": T U R N S — N is at position 4?

4. T is present but not in position 1 (from guess 2).
5. S is not in the word.
6. Additionally, from guess 1, C, A, E are not in the word.

So the secret word has the pattern: _ U R N _ 
Positions:
- Position 1: unknown, cannot be T (since T in position 1 was wrong and we now know T exists but not at 1), and cannot be C, A, E, S.
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: R
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: unknown, and cannot be C, A, E, S.

Moreover, T is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in position 5 or...? Only positions 1 and 5 are unknown. But position 1 cannot have T because the feedback for T in position 1 is (x)? No, in ""turns"", T was in position 1 and we got T(-) meaning T is in the word but not in position 1. Therefore T must be in one of the other positions? But positions 2,3,4 are known to be U,R,N. So T must be in position 5? Or is that the only possibility?

Positions 2,3,4 are fixed: U, R, N.

Position 1 is unknown, position 5 is unknown.

And T is in the word but not in position 1. Therefore, since positions 2,3,4 are occupied by U,R,N and not T, T must be in position 5.

So T is in position 5.

Therefore, position 5 is T.

So now we have: U in position 2, R in position 3, N in position 4, and T must be in position 5.

And position 1 is the only missing letter.

The secret word is: ? U R N T

Now, we need to find a valid English word that fits the pattern _ U R N T.

Moreover, position 1 cannot be C, A, E, S (from previous feedback).

Also, we need to consider what letters are possible for the start.

Common English words ending with ""URNT"": BurnT? BurnT is not five letters.

Five-letter word: ""BURNT"" comes to mind.

B U R N T.

But position 1 must be a letter that isn't excluded.

Excluded letters: C, A, E, S.

We haven't tested B yet.

""burnt"" is a valid word.

But let's check the letters: B, U, R, N, T.

We know U,R,N,T are in the word, and B is not yet tested.

Is there any other possibility?

What are the common words that match _ U R N T?

- BURNT: B in first.
- CURNT: not a word.
- GURNT: not common.
- HURNT: not standard.
- LURNT: not word.
- MURNT: no.
- PURNT: no.

Also, some less common: ""durnt"" not a word.

So BURNT seems the most plausible.

But position 1 for T in the previous feedback (turns) had T in position 1 marked as (-), meaning T is in the word but not there.

And since the only other missing spot is position 5, it must be T.

Hence the word is BURNT? But let's confirm with our knowledge.

The pattern is _ U R N T.

For ""burnt"": positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:R, 4:N, 5:T.

We haven't tested B yet, so it could be present or not? But we don't know if B is in the word.

In our deduction, we said the word must have T in position 5, so the word ends with T.

Position 1 is the only letter left unknown.

Therefore, the secret word must be of the form + U R N T, where + is the first letter that hasn't been eliminated.

Eliminated letters: C, A, E, S.

Also, note that in ""crane"" we had R(-) meaning R was in the word but not position 2, which matches because in the secret word R is at position 3.

In ""turns"", T(-) means T is in word but not at position 1, which is correct since it must be at 5.

And U(✓), R(✓), N(✓) are correct positions.

S(x) correct.

So the word must end with T.

Thus, we need a five-letter word starting with some letter X, followed by U, R, N, T.

The only common English word fitting this pattern is ""BURNT"".

We could also consider ""TURNT"" but that is slang and not typically accepted, whereas ""BURNT"" is standard.

Therefore, a logical next guess would be ""BURNT"".

But since we have only one unknown letter left, we can guess it.

Moreover, we have not tested B elsewhere, so this will confirm.

But note: if we guess ""BURNT"", we will get full feedback.

We could also think if there are multiple possibilities? But I can't think of any valid word other than ""BURNT"".

For example, ""CURNT"" not a word.

""DURNT"" not standard.

So we should guess ""BURNT"".

But let's make sure about the answer.

Perhaps we should guess now.

Since we found that the pattern must be _URNT and T is fixed at position 5.

The letter at position 1 cannot be any of the eliminated ones (C,A,E,S), and must be a consonant or vowel that forms a word.

Possible: BURNT.

One other: LURNT? No.

MURNT? No.

PURNT? No.

So yes.

Therefore, I will guess ""burnt"".

But what about the first letter? It might be B, but let's see.

Another thought: is ""HURNT"" a word? No.

Thus, ""BURNT"" is the answer.

So the guess should be ""BURNT"".

Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1 (crane):** C(x), R(-), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  
   - C, A, E are not in the word.  
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.  
   - N is in position 4.

2. **Guess 2 (turns):** T(-), U(✓), R(✓), N(✓), S(x)  
   - T is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - U is in position 2 (correct position).  
   - R is in position 3 (correct position).  
   - N is in position 4 (confirmed).  
   - S is not in the word.

### Deduced constraints:
- **Pattern**: The secret word has U at position 2, R at position 3, and N at position 4 (so the pattern so far is _ U R N _).  
- **Position 1**: Must contain a letter, cannot be T (since T isn't in position 1), and cannot be C, A, E, or S (from feedback).  
- **Position 5**: Since T is in the word (from Guess 2 feedback) and cannot be in position 1, and positions 2–4 are fixed (U, R, N), T must be in position 5. Thus, the pattern is _ U R N T.  
- **Possible words**: Only common English word fitting _ U R N T is ""BURNT.""  
  - B is untested and allowed (not eliminated).  
  - No other valid words match the pattern (e.g., ""CURNT"" or ""HURNT"" are not valid).  

Therefore, ""BURNT"" is a logical and efficient guess to confirm the full word.

<guess>burnt</guess>",burnt,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
- C, A, E are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- N is in the word and in position 4.

Guess 2: turns -> T(-) U(✓) R(✓) N(✓) S(x)
- T is in the word but not in position 1.
- U is in the word and in position 2 (since position 2 in turns is U, and it is correct).
- R is in the word and in position 3 (since position 3 in turns is R, and it is correct).
- N is in the word and in position 4 (already known).
- S is not in the word.

Key insights from feedback:
1. U is in position 2.
2. R is in position 3.
3. N is in position 4.
4. T is present but not in position 1 (from guess 2).
5. S is not in the word.
6. Additionally, from guess 1, C, A, E are not in the word.

So the secret word has the pattern: _ U R N _ 
Positions:
- Position 1: unknown, cannot be T (since T in position 1 was wrong and we now know T exists but not at 1), and cannot be C, A, E, S.
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: R
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: unknown, and cannot be C, A, E, S.

Moreover, T is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in position 5 or...? Only positions 1 and 5 are unknown. But position 1 cannot have T because the feedback for T in position 1 is (x)? No, in ""turns"", T was in position 1 and we got T(-) meaning T is in the word but not in position 1. Therefore T must be in one of the other positions? But positions 2,3,4 are known to be U,R,N. So T must be in position 5? Or is that the only possibility?

Positions 2,3,4 are fixed: U, R, N.

Position 1 is unknown, position 5 is unknown.

And T is in the word but not in position 1. Therefore, since positions 2,3,4 are occupied by U,R,N and not T, T must be in position 5.

So T is in position 5.

Therefore, position 5 is T.

So now we have: U in position 2, R in position 3, N in position 4, and T must be in position 5.

And position 1 is the only missing letter.
