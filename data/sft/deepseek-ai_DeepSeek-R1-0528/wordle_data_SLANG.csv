We are playing Wordle. We have 6 tries to guess a 5-letter word.
 Since it's the first guess, we don't have any prior feedback. We want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word often uses common letters and has unique letters to cover more possibilities.

 Common letters in English: To cover vowels and common consonants, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", etc. are popular.

 After considering, I'll choose ""CRANE"". It includes the common vowels A, E and the consonants C, R, N which are common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

 Let me format the response as required.
</think>
I am considering making a good first guess for the Wordle game. The goal is to maximize information by using common letters and covering multiple possibilities. Common advice is to include vowels and frequent consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It includes three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, increasing coverage.
- It tests positions for key letters that often appear in many words.

This will help narrow down possibilities significantly based on the feedback symbols (✓, -, or x) for each letter position.

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(x)
Interpretation:
- C is not in the secret word at all (x).
- R is not in the secret word at all (x). Note: the R feedback is (x), meaning it's not in the word.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓). So, the second letter of the secret word is A (since A is the third letter in ""crane"", but note: positions are 1-based? Wait, let's clarify).

In ""crane"", the letters are:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: E

Feedback:
- C (position 1): x → not in word
- R (position 2): x → not in word
- A (position 3): ✓ → correct position → so the secret word's third letter is A.
- N (position 4): ✓ → correct position → so the secret word's fourth letter is N.
- E (position 5): x → not in word

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has the letter A in the third position and N in the fourth position.
- The secret word does not contain C, R, or E at all.
- Since R is not in the word, and C and E are also out.

We need to make a second guess. The secret word format: _ _ A N _ 

The first, second, and fifth letters are unknown, but we know they cannot be C, R, E (and also note that the letters we've guessed which aren't in the word are C, R, E; also, from the feedback, R is out).

We must guess a valid 5-letter word that fits:
- Third letter: A
- Fourth letter: N
- The word must not contain C, R, E.

Also, we want to maximize information. Since we already have positions 3 and 4 fixed, we focus on guessing the other positions.

We'll try to pick a word that has:
- A in position 3 and N in position 4 (to confirm, but actually we know these are fixed, so we must keep them? Actually, we can change them? 

Wait: in Wordle, the fixed positions remain fixed for correctness, but for the purpose of testing other letters, we may choose to use different letters in those fixed positions? But no: since we know A is fixed at position 3, we shouldn't change it? Actually, we know it's A and N in those positions, so we must keep them in our guess? Not necessarily: we can try to test other letters even if it means moving A and N? But wait: because we have ✓, that means the letter A is in the word and in the third position. Therefore, the third position must be A and it must remain A. Similarly for the fourth position.

So, our next guess must have:
- Third letter: A
- Fourth letter: N

Other constraints:
- The word must not contain C, R, E.
- And note: letters that are not in the word at all (from previous x) cannot appear.

Now, what about the other letters? We need to guess letters for positions 1, 2, and 5.

Moreover, we want to choose a word that tests common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Potential words: 
Format: ? ? A N ? 

Common words: 
- B can be used? Let me think of words ending with ""AN"": 
Examples: 
- MANGA? But G might be new? And positions: M in 1, A in 2 (but wait our format: third letter is A, so if we say ""MANGA"": positions 1:M, 2:A, 3:N? Wait no: ""MANGA"" has M,A,N,G,A → but third letter is N, not A. So that doesn't work.

We need: letter1, letter2, A, N, letter5.

Examples of words: 
- PLAN: but PLAN is 4 letters.
- PLANTS: 6 letters, too long.
- Words that match the pattern: 
  - BRAND: but R is not allowed (R is excluded). We know R is not in the word.
  - STAND: S(1), T(2), A(3), N(4), D(5). But is that valid? Yes, STAND is a word.

Checking constraints:
- STAND: Positions: 
  1: S → is S allowed? We don't know if S is in the word or not, but not excluded yet.
  2: T
  3: A (fixed)
  4: N (fixed)
  5: D
Also, STAND does not contain C, R, E? It has S,T,A,N,D → no C, R, E → so acceptable.

But note: we must avoid R, and here we don't have R.

Are there other words? 
- SWANS: S,W,A,N,S → but third letter is A? ""SWANS"" → S(1), W(2), A(3), N(4), S(5) → that fits pattern. But ""SWANS"" has two S's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? Wordle allows duplicate letters? But the secret word might have duplicates? However, our pattern doesn't require duplicates. Let's consider.

But the feedback rules: If there is a duplicate in the guess and the secret word has one, it might show only the necessary ... but let's avoid complexity.

Another word: PHANTOM? too long.

SHANK: S,H,A,N,K → H and K? 

But I need to maximize information: using letters that are common and not yet tested.

We haven't tested many letters: Only C, R, A, N, E were tested. A and N are fixed and present. C, R, E are absent.

So, we must try new letters: e.g., vowels: we have A already, but O, I, U? Or consonants: S, T, D, L, etc.

STAND: uses S, T, D (and A, N). This tests S, T, D.

Other options:
- PIANO: P(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), O(5) → but O is new? Yes. Also tests P, I, O. But note: PIANO has no E, C, R? Yes.

But STAND seems more common? And PIANO might be less common? But both are valid.

Let's think: we know third and fourth letters are A and N, so we are only missing first, second, and fifth.

So, we can choose a word that uses common letters in positions 1, 2, and 5.

Common starting letters: S, L, T, etc.

Another word: LAIN? But 4 letters? 5 letters: PLAIN? But P,L,A,I,N? Wait: PLAIN → P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), N(5) → but wait, our fourth letter must be N? Then this would be: position 3:A, 4:N? But ""PLAIN"" has A in position 3, but N in position 5? So pattern: position 4 should be N, but in PLAIN it's I? So that doesn't fit.

So, we must have:

Position 1,2: ??
Position 3: A
Position 4: N
Position 5: ?

So, two letters before A and one after.

Other than STAND, we have:
- BEANS: B,E,A,N,S → but E is excluded -> not allowed.
- WEANS? Not a valid word. 
- MEANS: M,E,A,N,S → E is excluded -> invalid.
- LEANS: L,E,A,N,S → E excluded? invalid.
- DEANS: D,E,A,N,S → E excluded.

So without E? 
- BRAND: B,R,A,N,D → but R excluded -> invalid.
- SLAND? Not a commonly used word? And it might be invalid.

Valid words:
- STAND (as I thought)
- SHAND? Not common.
- WANLY? W,A,N,L,Y → but then position 3 would be N? wait: W(1), A(2), N(3), L(4), Y(5) → but we need A at position 3? So that doesn't fit.

We must have pattern: __ A N _

So:
- STAND: valid.
- PIANO: P,I,A,N,O → yes, letters: P,I,O → none excluded, and pattern fits: P(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), O(5).
- GIANT: G,I,A,N,T → pattern: G(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). Also tests G, I, T.
- BIANO? Not a word.
- ALIGN: A,L,I,G,N → but this has A in position 1 and then L,I,G,N → position 3 is I, so not A? So doesn't fit pattern.

Similarly, words like ""URBAN"": U,R,B,A,N → R excluded and also position 3 is A? U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4), N(5) → no, position 3 is B.

So, the good options are STAND, PIANO, GIANT.

Now, which gives more information? 
- STAND: tests S,T,D (and A,N)
- PIANO: tests P,I,O
- GIANT: tests G,I,T

We already know A and N are present and fixed.

We want to test new common vowels? We have A already, so O and I are important. 

In STAND: has T and D (and S), no vowel except A? 
In PIANO: has two vowels: I and O? So that might cover more vowels.

Also, in the feedback, we might get which of these are in the word and their positions.

But note: STAND has S at the beginning? Maybe more common?

Also, considering letter distribution: 
- We have to avoid C, R, E.

Another word: ""SPAIN"": but S,P,A,I,N → then position 4 is I? Then pattern: S,P,A,I,N → position 1:S, 2:P, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N → but we need position 4 to be N? So that's wrong.

Wait, no: we must have position 3=A and position 4=N.

Therefore, a word like ""SAINT"": S,A,I,N,T → S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) → but in this, position 3 is I? So A is not in position 3? Therefore, ""SAINT"" does not have A in position 3? We must have A in position 3? 

So, our pattern: ? in position 1, ? in position 2, then A in position 3, then N in position 4, then ? in position 5.

So, ""SAINT"" is S in 1, A in 2, I in 3 → but we need A in 3? That's different.

Therefore, the word must be:

Letter1, letter2, A, N, letter5.

Let me list common 5-letter words starting with (unknown) and ending with AN? Actually, not starting, but third and fourth fixed.

So, words: 
- PLAN: 4 letters.
- PLANE: E is excluded → invalid.
- PLANS: P,L,A,N,S → P(1),L(2),A(3),N(4),S(5) → valid? PLANS is a word. Tests P, L, S.

So PLANS: letters P, L, S.

Similarly, WEANS? Not a word. Means? Not valid. 

Other words:
- BRAND: contains R → invalid.
- STAND: valid. S, T, D?
- GRAND: G,R,A,N,D → R excluded → invalid.
- SLANT: S,L,A,N,T → valid. Tests S, L, T.
- PLANT: P,L,A,N,T → valid. Tests P, L, T.
- GIANT: G,I,A,N,T → valid. Tests G, I, T.
- PIANO: valid. P, I, O.

Between these: PLANS, STAND, SLANT, PLANT, GIANT, PIANO.

Now, we have not tested any letters except C, R, E, A, N. So almost all consonants and other vowels are available.

We want to test vowels: the word contains A, but we need to know about other vowels? The secret word might have O, I, U? Position 1 or 2 or 5.

In STAND, there are no vowels except A? 
STAND: S, T, A, N, D → no vowel? A is vowel? Yes, but we know it's present. Others? Not.

In GIANT: G, I, A, N, T → has I? vowel.

In PIANO: P, I, A, N, O → has I and O? vowels.

In PLANS: P, L, A, N, S → no vowel except A? same.

So PIANO tests three vowels: I, O, and A. Since A is fixed, but by testing I and O, we get information.

Also, PIANO uses more high-frequency letters? E is excluded? Already, so O and I are the next common vowels.

Therefore, I think PIANO is a good choice: 
- Tests P, I, O (and A and N as fixed).
- Position 1: P → test if P is in the word at position 1.
- Position 2: I → test if I is in the word and if it is at position 2 or not.
- Position 5: O → test if O is in the word at position 5.

And the word does not contain any excluded letters.

So, I choose ""PIANO"".

But note: the first letter P? We don't have any constraints.

Alternatively, GIANT tests G and I and T? But has only one new vowel: I.

But PIANO seems better.

Let me confirm: PIANO is 5 letters and valid? Yes.

Another option: MANGO? M,A,N,G,O → then position 1:M, 2:A? Wait: position 3 must be A? If MANGO: position1:M, position2:A, position3:N, position4:G, position5:O → but we need third letter A and fourth letter N? So mismatched: not the pattern. 

Therefore, PIANO fits: P in 1, I in 2, A in 3, N in 4, O in 5.

Yes.

So, I'll go with PIANO.

But note: the fifth letter might be O? We don't know.

We are still safe to test.

Therefore, next guess: PIANO.

<guess>piano</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- The third letter is **A** (correct position).
- The fourth letter is **N** (correct position).
- Letters **C**, **R**, and **E** are not in the secret word at all.

The secret word follows the pattern: `_ _ A N _`.

For the second guess:
- Must include **A** in position 3 and **N** in position 4.
- Cannot use **C**, **R**, or **E**.
- Avoid reusing incorrect letters to maximize new information.
- Focus on testing common letters and vowels (like **O** and **I**) that haven't been guessed yet.

""PIANO"" is a strong choice because:
- It fits the pattern (`P I A N O`).
- It tests new vowels (**O** and **I**) and consonants (**P**).
- All letters are distinct and valid.

Other options:
- PIANO: P(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), O(5) → but O is new? Yes. Also tests P, I, O. But note: PIANO has no E, C, R? Yes.

But STAND seems more common? And PIANO might be less common? But both are valid.

Let's think: we know third and fourth letters are A and N, so we are only missing first, second, and fifth.

So, we can choose a word that uses common letters in positions 1, 2, and 5.

Common starting letters: S, L, T, etc.

Another word: LAIN? But 4 letters? 5 letters: PLAIN? But P,L,A,I,N? Wait: PLAIN → P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), N(5) → but wait, our fourth letter must be N? Then this would be: position 3:A, 4:N? But ""PLAIN"" has A in position 3, but N in position 5? So pattern: position 4 should be N, but in PLAIN it's I? So that doesn't fit.

So, we must have:

Position 1,2: ??
Position 3: A
Position 4: N
Position 5: ?

So, two letters before A and one after.

Other than STAND, we have:
- BEANS: B,E,A,N,S → but E is excluded -> not allowed.
- WEANS? Not a valid word. 
- MEANS: M,E,A,N,S → E is excluded -> invalid.
- LEANS: L,E,A,N,S → E excluded? invalid.
- DEANS: D,E,A,N,S → E excluded.

So without E? 
- BRAND: B,R,A,N,D → but R excluded -> invalid.
- SLAND? Not a commonly used word? And it might be invalid.

Valid words:
- STAND (as I thought)
- SHAND? Not common.
- WANLY? W,A,N,L,Y → but then position 3 would be N? wait: W(1), A(2), N(3), L(4), Y(5) → but we need A at position 3? So that doesn't fit.

We must have pattern: __ A N _

So:
- STAND: valid.
- PIANO: P,I,A,N,O → yes, letters: P,I,O → none excluded, and pattern fits: P(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), O(5).
- GIANT: G,I,A,N,T → pattern: G(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). Also tests G, I, T.
- BIANO? Not a word.
- ALIGN: A,L,I,G,N → but this has A in position 1 and then L,I,G,N → position 3 is I, so not A? So doesn't fit pattern.

Similarly, words like ""URBAN"": U,R,B,A,N → R excluded and also position 3 is A? U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4), N(5) → no, position 3 is B.

So, the good options are STAND, PIANO, GIANT.

Now, which gives more information? 
- STAND: tests S,T,D (and A,N)
- PIANO: tests P,I,O
- GIANT: tests G,I,T

We already know A and N are present and fixed.

We want to test new common vowels? We have A already, so O and I are important. 

In STAND: has T and D (and S), no vowel except A? 
In PIANO: has two vowels: I and O? So that might cover more vowels.

Also, in the feedback, we might get which of these are in the word and their positions.

But note: STAND has S at the beginning? Maybe more common?

Also, considering letter distribution: 
- We have to avoid C, R, E.

Another word: ""SPAIN"": but S,P,A,I,N → then position 4 is I? Then pattern: S,P,A,I,N → position 1:S, 2:P, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N → but we need position 4 to be N? So that's wrong.

Wait, no: we must have position 3=A and position 4=N.

Therefore, a word like ""SAINT"": S,A,I,N,T → S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) → but in this, position 3 is I? So A is not in position 3? Therefore, ""SAINT"" does not have A in position 3? We must have A in position 3? 

So, our pattern: ? in position 1, ? in position 2, then A in position 3, then N in position 4, then ? in position 5.

So, ""SAINT"" is S in 1, A in 2, I in 3 → but we need A in 3? That's different.

Therefore, the word must be:

Letter1, letter2, A, N, letter5.

Let me list common 5-letter words starting with (unknown) and ending with AN? Actually, not starting, but third and fourth fixed.

So, words: 
- PLAN: 4 letters.
- PLANE: E is excluded → invalid.
- PLANS: P,L,A,N,S → P(1),L(2),A(3),N(4),S(5) → valid? PLANS is a word. Tests P, L, S.

So PLANS: letters P, L, S.

Similarly, WEANS? Not a word. Means? Not valid. 

Other words:
- BRAND: contains R → invalid.
- STAND: valid. S, T, D?
- GRAND: G,R,A,N,D → R excluded → invalid.
- SLANT: S,L,A,N,T → valid. Tests S, L, T.
- PLANT: P,L,A,N,T → valid. Tests P, L, T.
- GIANT: G,I,A,N,T → valid. Tests G, I, T.
- PIANO: valid. P, I, O.

Between these: PLANS, STAND, SLANT, PLANT, GIANT, PIANO.

Now, we have not tested any letters except C, R, E, A, N. So almost all consonants and other vowels are available.

We want to test vowels: the word contains A, but we need to know about other vowels? The secret word might have O, I, U? Position 1 or 2 or 5.

In STAND, there are no vowels except A? 
STAND: S, T, A, N, D → no vowel? A is vowel? Yes, but we know it's present. Others? Not.

In GIANT: G, I, A, N, T → has I? vowel.

In PIANO: P, I, A, N, O → has I and O? vowels.

In PLANS: P, L, A, N, S → no vowel except A? same.

So PIANO tests three vowels: I, O, and A. Since A is fixed, but by testing I and O, we get information.

Also, PIANO uses more high-frequency letters? E is excluded? Already, so O and I are the next common vowels.

Therefore, I think PIANO is a good choice: 
- Tests P, I, O (and A and N as fixed).
- Position 1: P → test if P is in the word at position 1.
- Position 2: I → test if I is in the word and if it is at position 2 or not.
- Position 5: O → test if O is in the word at position 5.

And the word does not contain any excluded letters.

So, I choose ""PIANO"".

But note: the first letter P? We don't have any constraints.

Alternatively, GIANT tests G and I and T? But has only one new vowel: I.

But PIANO seems better.

Let me confirm: PIANO is 5 letters and valid? Yes.

Another option: MANGO? M,A,N,G,O → then position 1:M, 2:A? Wait: position 3 must be A? If MANGO: position1:M, position2:A, position3:N, position4:G, position5:O → but we need third letter A and fourth letter N? So mismatched: not the pattern. 

Therefore, PIANO fits: P in 1, I in 2, A in 3, N in 4, O in 5.

Yes.

So, I'll go with PIANO.

But note: the fifth letter might be O? We don't know.

We are still safe to test.

Therefore, next guess: PIANO.

<guess>piano</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- The third letter is **A** (correct position).
- The fourth letter is **N** (correct position).
- Letters **C**, **R**, and **E** are not in the secret word at all.

The secret word follows the pattern: `_ _ A N _`.

For the second guess:
- Must include **A** in position 3 and **N** in position 4.
- Cannot use **C**, **R**, or **E**.
- Avoid reusing incorrect letters to maximize new information.
- Focus on testing common letters and vowels (like **O** and **I**) that haven't been guessed yet.

""PIANO"" is a strong choice because:
- It fits the pattern (`P I A N O`).
- It tests new vowels (**O** and **I**) and consonants (**P**).
- All letters are distinct and valid.",Guess 2: piano -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(x) A(✓) N(✓) O(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are playing Wordle. We have 6 tries to guess a 5-letter word.
 Since it's the first guess, we don't have any prior feedback. We want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word often uses common letters and has unique letters to cover more possibilities.

 Common letters in English: To cover vowels and common consonants, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", etc. are popular.

 After considering, I'll choose ""CRANE"". It includes the common vowels A, E and the consonants C, R, N which are common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

 Let me format the response as required.I am considering making a good first guess for the Wordle game. The goal is to maximize information by using common letters and covering multiple possibilities. Common advice is to include vowels and frequent consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It includes three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, increasing coverage.
- It tests positions for key letters that often appear in many words.

This will help narrow down possibilities significantly based on the feedback symbols (✓, -, or x) for each letter position.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(x)
Interpretation:
- C is not in the secret word at all (x).
- R is not in the secret word at all (x). Note: the R feedback is (x), meaning it's not in the word.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓). So, the second letter of the secret word is A (since A is the third letter in ""crane"", but note: positions are 1-based? Wait, let's clarify).

In ""crane"", the letters are:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: E

Feedback:
- C (position 1): x → not in word
- R (position 2): x → not in word
- A (position 3): ✓ → correct position → so the secret word's third letter is A.
- N (position 4): ✓ → correct position → so the secret word's fourth letter is N.
- E (position 5): x → not in word

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has the letter A in the third position and N in the fourth position.
- The secret word does not contain C, R, or E at all.
- Since R is not in the word, and C and E are also out.

We need to make a second guess. The secret word format: _ _ A N _ 

The first, second, and fifth letters are unknown, but we know they cannot be C, R, E (and also note that the letters we've guessed which aren't in the word are C, R, E; also, from the feedback, R is out).

We must guess a valid 5-letter word that fits:
- Third letter: A
- Fourth letter: N
- The word must not contain C, R, E.

Also, we want to maximize information. Since we already have positions 3 and 4 fixed, we focus on guessing the other positions.

We'll try to pick a word that has:
- A in position 3 and N in position 4 (to confirm, but actually we know these are fixed, so we must keep them? Actually, we can change them? 

Wait: in Wordle, the fixed positions remain fixed for correctness, but for the purpose of testing other letters, we may choose to use different letters in those fixed positions? But no: since we know A is fixed at position 3, we shouldn't change it? Actually, we know it's A and N in those positions, so we must keep them in our guess? Not necessarily: we can try to test other letters even if it means moving A and N? But wait: because we have ✓, that means the letter A is in the word and in the third position. Therefore, the third position must be A and it must remain A. Similarly for the fourth position.

So, our next guess must have:
- Third letter: A
- Fourth letter: N

Other constraints:
- The word must not contain C, R, E.
- And note: letters that are not in the word at all (from previous x) cannot appear.

Now, what about the other letters? We need to guess letters for positions 1, 2, and 5.

Moreover, we want to choose a word that tests common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Potential words: 
Format: ? ? A N ? 

Common words: 
- B can be used? Let me think of words ending with ""AN"": 
Examples: 
- MANGA? But G might be new? And positions: M in 1, A in 2 (but wait our format: third letter is A, so if we say ""MANGA"": positions 1:M, 2:A, 3:N? Wait no: ""MANGA"" has M,A,N,G,A → but third letter is N, not A. So that doesn't work.

We need: letter1, letter2, A, N, letter5.

Examples of words: 
- PLAN: but PLAN is 4 letters.
- PLANTS: 6 letters, too long.
- Words that match the pattern: 
  - BRAND: but R is not allowed (R is excluded). We know R is not in the word.
  - STAND: S(1), T(2), A(3), N(4), D(5). But is that valid? Yes, STAND is a word.

Checking constraints:
- STAND: Positions: 
  1: S → is S allowed? We don't know if S is in the word or not, but not excluded yet.
  2: T
  3: A (fixed)
  4: N (fixed)
  5: D
Also, STAND does not contain C, R, E? It has S,T,A,N,D → no C, R, E → so acceptable.

But note: we must avoid R, and here we don't have R.

Are there other words? 
- SWANS: S,W,A,N,S → but third letter is A? ""SWANS"" → S(1), W(2), A(3), N(4), S(5) → that fits pattern. But ""SWANS"" has two S's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? Wordle allows duplicate letters? But the secret word might have duplicates? However, our pattern doesn't require duplicates. Let's consider.

But the feedback rules: If there is a duplicate in the guess and the secret word has one, it might show only the necessary ... but let's avoid complexity.

Another word: PHANTOM? too long.

SHANK: S,H,A,N,K → H and K? 

But I need to maximize information: using letters that are common and not yet tested.

We haven't tested many letters: Only C, R, A, N, E were tested. A and N are fixed and present. C, R, E are absent.

So, we must try new letters: e.g., vowels: we have A already, but O, I, U? Or consonants: S, T, D, L, etc.

STAND: uses S, T, D (and A, N). This tests S, T, D.

Other options:
- PIANO: P(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), O(5) → but O is new? Yes. Also tests P, I, O. But note: PIANO has no E, C, R? Yes.

But STAND seems more common? And PIANO might be less common? But both are valid.

Let's think: we know third and fourth letters are A and N, so we are only missing first, second, and fifth.

So, we can choose a word that uses common letters in positions 1, 2, and 5.

Common starting letters: S, L, T, etc.

Another word: LAIN? But 4 letters? 5 letters: PLAIN? But P,L,A,I,N? Wait: PLAIN → P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), N(5) → but wait, our fourth letter must be N? Then this would be: position 3:A, 4:N? But ""PLAIN"" has A in position 3, but N in position 5? So pattern: position 4 should be N, but in PLAIN it's I? So that doesn't fit.

So, we must have:

Position 1,2: ??
Position 3: A
Position 4: N
Position 5: ?

So, two letters before A and one after.

Other than STAND, we have:
- BEANS: B,E,A,N,S → but E is excluded -> not allowed.
- WEANS? Not a valid word. 
- MEANS: M,E,A,N,S → E is excluded -> invalid.
- LEANS: L,E,A,N,S → E excluded? invalid.
- DEANS: D,E,A,N,S → E excluded.

So without E? 
- BRAND: B,R,A,N,D → but R excluded -> invalid.
- SLAND? Not a commonly used word? And it might be invalid.

Valid words:
- STAND (as I thought)
- SHAND? Not common.
- WANLY? W,A,N,L,Y → but then position 3 would be N? wait: W(1), A(2), N(3), L(4), Y(5) → but we need A at position 3? So that doesn't fit.

We must have pattern: __ A N _

So:
- STAND: valid.
- PIANO: P,I,A,N,O → yes, letters: P,I,O → none excluded, and pattern fits: P(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), O(5).
- GIANT: G,I,A,N,T → pattern: G(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). Also tests G, I, T.
- BIANO? Not a word.
- ALIGN: A,L,I,G,N → but this has A in position 1 and then L,I,G,N → position 3 is I, so not A? So doesn't fit pattern.

Similarly, words like ""URBAN"": U,R,B,A,N → R excluded and also position 3 is A? U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4), N(5) → no, position 3 is B.

So, the good options are STAND, PIANO, GIANT.

Now, which gives more information? 
- STAND: tests S,T,D (and A,N)
- PIANO: tests P,I,O
- GIANT: tests G,I,T

We already know A and N are present and fixed.

We want to test new common vowels? We have A already, so O and I are important. 

In STAND: has T and D (and S), no vowel except A? 
In PIANO: has two vowels: I and O? So that might cover more vowels.

Also, in the feedback, we might get which of these are in the word and their positions.

But note: STAND has S at the beginning? Maybe more common?

Also, considering letter distribution: 
- We have to avoid C, R, E.

Another word: ""SPAIN"": but S,P,A,I,N → then position 4 is I? Then pattern: S,P,A,I,N → position 1:S, 2:P, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N → but we need position 4 to be N? So that's wrong.

Wait, no: we must have position 3=A and position 4=N.

Therefore, a word like ""SAINT"": S,A,I,N,T → S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) → but in this, position 3 is I? So A is not in position 3? Therefore, ""SAINT"" does not have A in position 3? We must have A in position 3? 

So, our pattern: ? in position 1, ? in position 2, then A in position 3, then N in position 4, then ? in position 5.

So, ""SAINT"" is S in 1, A in 2, I in 3 → but we need A in 3? That's different.

Therefore, the word must be:

Letter1, letter2, A, N, letter5.

Let me list common 5-letter words starting with (unknown) and ending with AN? Actually, not starting, but third and fourth fixed.

So, words: 
- PLAN: 4 letters.
- PLANE: E is excluded → invalid.
- PLANS: P,L,A,N,S → P(1),L(2),A(3),N(4),S(5) → valid? PLANS is a word. Tests P, L, S.

So PLANS: letters P, L, S.

Similarly, WEANS? Not a word. Means? Not valid. 

Other words:
- BRAND: contains R → invalid.
- STAND: valid. S, T, D?
- GRAND: G,R,A,N,D → R excluded → invalid.
- SLANT: S,L,A,N,T → valid. Tests S, L, T.
- PLANT: P,L,A,N,T → valid. Tests P, L, T.
- GIANT: G,I,A,N,T → valid. Tests G, I, T.
- PIANO: valid. P, I, O.

Between these: PLANS, STAND, SLANT, PLANT, GIANT, PIANO.

Now, we have not tested any letters except C, R, E, A, N. So almost all consonants and other vowels are available.

We want to test vowels: the word contains A, but we need to know about other vowels? The secret word might have O, I, U? Position 1 or 2 or 5.

In STAND, there are no vowels except A? 
STAND: S, T, A, N, D → no vowel? A is vowel? Yes, but we know it's present. Others? Not.

In GIANT: G, I, A, N, T → has I? vowel.

In PIANO: P, I, A, N, O → has I and O? vowels.

In PLANS: P, L, A, N, S → no vowel except A? same.

So PIANO tests three vowels: I, O, and A. Since A is fixed, but by testing I and O, we get information.

Also, PIANO uses more high-frequency letters? E is excluded? Already, so O and I are the next common vowels.

Therefore, I think PIANO is a good choice: 
- Tests P, I, O (and A and N as fixed).
- Position 1: P → test if P is in the word at position 1.
- Position 2: I → test if I is in the word and if it is at position 2 or not.
- Position 5: O → test if O is in the word at position 5.

And the word does not contain any excluded letters.

So, I choose ""PIANO"".

But note: the first letter P? We don't have any constraints.

Alternatively, GIANT tests G and I and T? But has only one new vowel: I.

But PIANO seems better.

Let me confirm: PIANO is 5 letters and valid? Yes.

Another option: MANGO? M,A,N,G,O → then position 1:M, 2:A? Wait: position 3 must be A? If MANGO: position1:M, position2:A, position3:N, position4:G, position5:O → but we need third letter A and fourth letter N? So mismatched: not the pattern. 

Therefore, PIANO fits: P in 1, I in 2, A in 3, N in 4, O in 5.

Yes.

So, I'll go with PIANO.

But note: the fifth letter might be O? We don't know.

We are still safe to test.

Therefore, next guess: PIANO.

<guess>piano</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- The third letter is **A** (correct position).
- The fourth letter is **N** (correct position).
- Letters **C**, **R**, and **E** are not in the secret word at all.

The secret word follows the pattern: `_ _ A N _`.

For the second guess:
- Must include **A** in position 3 and **N** in position 4.
- Cannot use **C**, **R**, or **E**.
- Avoid reusing incorrect letters to maximize new information.
- Focus on testing common letters and vowels (like **O** and **I**) that haven't been guessed yet.

""PIANO"" is a strong choice because:
- It fits the pattern (`P I A N O`).
- It tests new vowels (**O** and **I**) and consonants (**P**).
- All letters are distinct and valid.

Wait, let\'s clarify).\n\nIn ""crane"", the letters are:\n- Position 1: C\n- Position 2: R\n- Position 3: A\n- Position 4: N\n- Position 5: E\n\nFeedback:\n- C (position 1): x → not in word\n- R (position 2): x → not in word\n- A (position 3): ✓ → correct position → so the secret word\'s third letter is A.\n- N (position 4): ✓ → correct position → so the secret word\'s fourth letter is N.\n- E (position 5): x → not in word\n\nTherefore, we know:\n- The secret word has the letter A in the third position and N in the fourth position.\n- The secret word does not contain C, R, or E at all.\n- Since R is not in the word, and C and E are also out.\n\nWe need to make a second guess. The secret word format: _ _ A N _ \n\nThe first, second, and fifth letters are unknown, but we know they cannot be C, R, E (and also note that the letters we\'ve guessed which aren\'t in the word are C, R, E; also, from the feedback, R is out).\n\nWe must guess a valid 5-letter word that fits:\n- Third letter: A\n- Fourth letter: N\n- The word must not contain C, R, E.\n\nAlso, we want to maximize information. Since we already have positions 3 and 4 fixed, we focus on guessing the other positions.\n\nWe\'ll try to pick a word that has:\n- A in position 3 and N in position 4 (to confirm, but actually we know these are fixed, so we must keep them? Actually, we can change them? \n\nWait: in Wordle, the fixed positions remain fixed for correctness, but for the purpose of testing other letters, we may choose to use different letters in those fixed positions? But no: since we know A is fixed at position 3, we shouldn\'t change it? Actually, we know it\'s A and N in those positions, so we must keep them in our guess? Not necessarily: we can try to test other letters even if it means moving A and N? But wait: because we have ✓, that means the letter A is in the word and in the third position. Therefore, the third position must be A and it must remain A. Similarly for the fourth position.\n\nSo, our next guess must have:\n- Third letter: A\n- Fourth letter: N\n\nOther constraints:\n- The word must not contain C, R, E.\n- And note: letters that are not in the word at all (from previous x) cannot appear.\n\nNow, what about the other letters? We need to guess letters for positions 1, 2, and 5.\n\nMoreover, we want to choose a word that tests common letters to narrow down possibilities.\n\nPotential words: \nFormat: ? ? A N ? \n\nCommon words: \n- B can be used? Let me think of words ending with ""AN"": \nExamples: \n- MANGA? But G might be new? And positions: M in 1, A in 2 (but wait our format: third letter is A, so if we say ""MANGA"": positions 1:M, 2:A, 3:N? Wait no: ""MANGA"" has M,A,N,G,A → but third letter is N, not A. So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe need: letter1, letter2, A, N, letter5.\n\nExamples of words: \n- PLAN: but PLAN is 4 letters.\n- PLANTS: 6 letters, too long.\n- Words that match the pattern: \n  - BRAND: but R is not allowed (R is excluded). We know R is not in the word.\n  - STAND: S(1), T(2), A(3), N(4), D(5). But is that valid? Yes, STAND is a word.\n\nChecking constraints:\n- STAND: Positions: \n  1: S → is S allowed? We don\'t know if S is in the word or not, but not excluded yet.\n  2: T\n  3: A (fixed)\n  4: N (fixed)\n  5: D\nAlso, STAND does not contain C, R, E? It has S,T,A,N,D → no C, R, E → so acceptable.\n\nBut note: we must avoid R, and here we don\'t have R.\n\nAre there other words? \n- SWANS: S,W,A,N,S → but third letter is A? ""SWANS"" → S(1), W(2), A(3), N(4), S(5) → that fits pattern. But ""SWANS"" has two S\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? Wordle allows duplicate letters? But the secret word might have duplicates? However, our pattern doesn\'t require duplicates. Let\'s consider.\n\nBut the feedback rules: If there is a duplicate in the guess and the secret word has one, it might show only the necessary ... but let\'s avoid complexity.\n\nAnother word: PHANTOM? too long.\n\nSHANK: S,H,A,N,K → H and K? \n\nBut I need to maximize information: using letters that are common and not yet tested.\n\nWe haven\'t tested many letters: Only C, R, A, N, E were tested. A and N are fixed and present. C, R, E are absent.\n\nSo, we must try new letters: e.g., vowels: we have A already, but O, I, U? Or consonants: S, T, D, L, etc.\n\nSTAND: uses S, T, D (and A, N). This tests S, T, D.\n\nOther options:\n- PIANO: P(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), O(5) → but O is new? Yes. Also tests P, I, O. But note: PIANO has no E, C, R? Yes.\n\nBut STAND seems more common? And PIANO might be less common? But both are valid.\n\nLet\'s think: we know third and fourth letters are A and N, so we are only missing first, second, and fifth.\n\nSo, we can choose a word that uses common letters in positions 1, 2, and 5.\n\nCommon starting letters: S, L, T, etc.\n\nAnother word: LAIN? But 4 letters? 5 letters: PLAIN? But P,L,A,I,N? Wait: PLAIN → P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), N(5) → but wait, our fourth letter must be N? Then this would be: position 3:A, 4:N? But ""PLAIN"" has A in position 3, but N in position 5? So pattern: position 4 should be N, but in PLAIN it\'s I? So that doesn\'t fit.\n\nSo, we must have:\n\nPosition 1,2: ??\nPosition 3: A\nPosition 4: N\nPosition 5: ?\n\nSo, two letters before A and one after.\n\nOther than STAND, we have:\n- BEANS: B,E,A,N,S → but E is excluded -> not allowed.\n- WEANS? Not a valid word. \n- MEANS: M,E,A,N,S → E is excluded -> invalid.\n- LEANS: L,E,A,N,S → E excluded? invalid.\n- DEANS: D,E,A,N,S → E excluded.\n\nSo without E? \n- BRAND: B,R,A,N,D → but R excluded -> invalid.\n- SLAND? Not a commonly used word? And it might be invalid.\n\nValid words:\n- STAND (as I thought)\n- SHAND? Not common.\n- WANLY? W,A,N,L,Y → but then position 3 would be N? wait: W(1), A(2), N(3), L(4), Y(5) → but we need A at position 3? So that doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe must have pattern: __ A N _\n\nSo:\n- STAND: valid.\n- PIANO: P,I,A,N,O → yes, letters: P,I,O → none excluded, and pattern fits: P(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), O(5).\n- GIANT: G,I,A,N,T → pattern: G(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). Also tests G, I, T.\n- BIANO? Not a word.\n- ALIGN: A,L,I,G,N → but this has A in position 1 and then L,I,G,N → position 3 is I, so not A? So doesn\'t fit pattern.\n\nSimilarly, words like ""URBAN"": U,R,B,A,N → R excluded and also position 3 is A? U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4), N(5) → no, position 3 is B.\n\nSo, the good options are STAND, PIANO, GIANT.\n\nNow, which gives more information? \n- STAND: tests S,T,D (and A,N)\n- PIANO: tests P,I,O\n- GIANT: tests G,I,T\n\nWe already know A and N are present and fixed.\n\nWe want to test new common vowels? We have A already, so O and I are important. \n\nIn STAND: has T and D (and S), no vowel except A? \nIn PIANO: has two vowels: I and O? So that might cover more vowels.\n\nAlso, in the feedback, we might get which of these are in the word and their positions.\n\nBut note: STAND has S at the beginning? Maybe more common?\n\nAlso, considering letter distribution: \n- We have to avoid C, R, E.\n\nAnother word: ""SPAIN"": but S,P,A,I,N → then position 4 is I? Then pattern: S,P,A,I,N → position 1:S, 2:P, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N → but we need position 4 to be N? So that\'s wrong.\n\nWait, no: we must have position 3=A and position 4=N.\n\nTherefore, a word like ""SAINT"": S,A,I,N,T → S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) → but in this, position 3 is I? So A is not in position 3? Therefore, ""SAINT"" does not have A in position 3? We must have A in position 3? \n\nSo, our pattern: ? in position 1, ? in position 2, then A in position 3, then N in position 4, then ? in position 5.\n\nSo, ""SAINT"" is S in 1, A in 2, I in 3 → but we need A in 3? That\'s different.\n\nTherefore, the word must be:\n\nLetter1, letter2, A, N, letter5.\n\nLet me list common 5-letter words starting with (unknown) and ending with AN? Actually, not starting, but third and fourth fixed.\n\nSo, words: \n- PLAN: 4 letters.\n- PLANE: E is excluded → invalid.\n- PLANS: P,L,A,N,S → P(1),L(2),A(3),N(4),S(5) → valid? PLANS is a word. Tests P, L, S.\n\nSo PLANS: letters P, L, S.\n\nSimilarly, WEANS? Not a word. Means? Not valid. \n\nOther words:\n- BRAND: contains R → invalid.\n- STAND: valid. S, T, D?\n- GRAND: G,R,A,N,D → R excluded → invalid.\n- SLANT: S,L,A,N,T → valid. Tests S, L, T.\n- PLANT: P,L,A,N,T → valid. Tests P, L, T.\n- GIANT: G,I,A,N,T → valid. Tests G, I, T.\n- PIANO: valid. P, I, O.\n\nBetween these: PLANS, STAND, SLANT, PLANT, GIANT, PIANO.\n\nNow, we have not tested any letters except C, R, E, A, N. So almost all consonants and other vowels are available.\n\nWe want to test vowels: the word contains A, but we need to know about other vowels? The secret word might have O, I, U? Position 1 or 2 or 5.\n\nIn STAND, there are no vowels except A? \nSTAND: S, T, A, N, D → no vowel? A is vowel? Yes, but we know it\'s present. Others? Not.\n\nIn GIANT: G, I, A, N, T → has I? vowel.\n\nIn PIANO: P, I, A, N, O → has I and O? vowels.\n\nIn PLANS: P, L, A, N, S → no vowel except A? same.\n\nSo PIANO tests three vowels: I, O, and A. Since A is fixed, but by testing I and O, we get information.\n\nAlso, PIANO uses more high-frequency letters? E is excluded? Already, so O and I are the next common vowels.\n\nTherefore, I think PIANO is a good choice: \n- Tests P, I, O (and A and N as fixed).\n- Position 1: P → test if P is in the word at position 1.\n- Position 2: I → test if I is in the word and if it is at position 2 or not.\n- Position 5: O → test if O is in the word at position 5.\n\nAnd the word does not contain any excluded letters.\n\nSo, I choose ""PIANO"".\n\nBut note: the first letter P? We don\'t have any constraints.\n\nAlternatively, GIANT tests G and I and T? But has only one new vowel: I.\n\nBut PIANO seems better.\n\nLet me confirm: PIANO is 5 letters and valid? Yes.\n\nAnother option: MANGO? M,A,N,G,O → then position 1:M, 2:A? Wait: position 3 must be A? If MANGO: position1:M, position2:A, position3:N, position4:G, position5:O → but we need third letter A and fourth letter N? So mismatched: not the pattern. \n\nTherefore, PIANO fits: P in 1, I in 2, A in 3, N in 4, O in 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with PIANO.\n\nBut note: the fifth letter might be O? We don\'t know.\n\nWe are still safe to test.\n\nTherefore, next guess: PIANO.\n\n<guess>piano</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- The third letter is **A** (correct position).\n- The fourth letter is **N** (correct position).\n- Letters **C**, **R**, and **E** are not in the secret word at all.\n\nThe secret word follows the pattern: `_ _ A N _`.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include **A** in position 3 and **N** in position 4.\n- Cannot use **C**, **R**, or **E**.\n- Avoid reusing incorrect letters to maximize new information.\n- Focus on testing common letters and vowels (like **O** and **I**) that haven\'t been guessed yet.\n\n""PIANO"" is a strong choice because:\n- It fits the pattern (`P I A N O`).\n- It tests new vowels (**O** and **I**) and consonants (**P**).\n- All letters are distinct and valid.\n\n<guess>piano</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: piano -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(x) A(✓) N(✓) O(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(x)
This means:
- C, R, E are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).

So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A N _ 
and does not contain C, R, E.

Second guess: ""piano"" → Feedback: P(x), I(x), A(✓), N(✓), O(x)
This means:
- P, I, O are not in the word at all.
- A and N are again confirmed in their correct positions (3 and 4).

So now we know:
- The secret word pattern: _ _ A N _
- The word does not contain: C, R, E, P, I, O.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, I, O. So the absent letters are: C, R, E, P, I, O.

We need to guess a 5-letter word that:
- Has the pattern: ? ? A N ? 
- Does not contain C, R, E, P, I, O.
- We should try to use common letters that haven't been tested yet.

Available letters: We have not tested many consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. And vowels: we have tested A (present), E, I, O (absent). The only vowel left is U? And sometimes Y.

But note: the word must have a vowel? Since A is already in the word, it might be the only vowel? Or there might be another? But we have to consider.

We need to form a word with pattern: _ _ A N _ 

Possible words? Let's think of common words.

We know the word must end with a consonant? Or vowel? We don't know.

Common words with ""AN"" in the middle? 

Examples:
- STAND: but S, T, A, N, D → but we haven't tested S, T, D. However, in our second guess we didn't test these? But STAND: S in position 1, T in position 2, D in position 5. But we have to avoid the absent letters? STAND does not contain C, R, E, P, I, O → so it's acceptable? But wait, we have to check if the letters are allowed.

But note: we have not received any feedback about S, T, D, so they might be present or absent.

But in STAND, we are testing S, T, D.

However, we have a problem: the feedback from the first guess told us that R is absent, and in STAND, there is no R? So it's okay.

But let me list possible words:

- STAND: S, T, A, N, D → pattern: S(1), T(2), A(3), N(4), D(5)
- SLAND? Not a common word.
- SLANT: S, L, A, N, T → pattern: S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5)
- PLANT: but P is absent → not allowed, because P is excluded.
- GIANT: G, I, A, N, T → but I is absent → not allowed.
- BLAND: B, L, A, N, D → pattern: B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), D(5) → and no excluded letters? B, L, D are new? Yes.

But we have to avoid I and O? BLAND: B, L, A, N, D → no I, O, etc. So acceptable.

Other words:
- GRAND: G, R, A, N, D → but R is absent → invalid.
- BRAND: same, R absent → invalid.
- FLANK: F, L, A, N, K → pattern: F(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) → valid? FLANK is a word? Yes.
- BLANK: B, L, A, N, K → pattern: B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) → valid.
- THANK: T, H, A, N, K → pattern: T(1), H(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) → valid.
- SHANK: S, H, A, N, K → pattern: S(1), H(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) → valid.

We have many options.

But we also have to consider that the word might have a vowel in position 1 or 2 or 5? The only vowel left is U and sometimes Y? Because A is already in position 3.

For example, words like ""HUMAN"": H,U,M,A,N → but then pattern: H(1), U(2), M(3), A(4), N(5) → but we need A in position 3? So that doesn't fit.

Another: ""WOMAN"": W,O,M,A,N → O is absent, and pattern: position 3 is M? Not A.

""MANLY"": M,A,N,L,Y → position 3 is N? Not A.

So, it seems that the words we have are mostly without vowels? But A is a vowel. The other positions can be consonants? For example, STAND, SLANT, BLAND, etc., are valid words without other vowels.

But what about words with U? For example, ""GUANO"": G,U,A,N,O → but O is absent → invalid.

""JUANA""? Not a common word? And J,U,A,N,A → but pattern: position 3 is A? J(1), U(2), A(3), N(4), A(5) → that could be? But ""JUANA"" is a proper noun? Not typically in Wordle? We should avoid.

Similarly, ""SUMAC"": S,U,M,A,C → but C is absent and pattern: position 3 is M? Not A.

So, it seems that the common words are consonant-heavy.

Now, we need to choose a word that tests new letters. We have to avoid the absent letters: C, R, E, P, I, O.

We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, P, I, O. So absent: C, R, E, P, I, O.

We have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to maximize information: test as many new common letters as possible.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.

In the pattern _ _ A N _, the first two letters and the last letter are to be guessed.

We can choose a word that uses common letters in these positions.

For example, STAND: tests S, T, D.

SLANT: tests S, L, T.

BLAND: tests B, L, D.

THANK: tests T, H, K.

We also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

Another idea: since we have only 6 tries, and we have 3 positions to figure out, we can try to cover more letters.

But note: we have 3 unknown positions, but the letters in those positions must form a valid word with A and N fixed.

We can also consider that the secret word might have one of the letters we test in the wrong position? But we are forced to put A and N in the correct positions.

So, let's list the possible words we can guess:

- STAND: S, T, D
- SLANT: S, L, T
- BLAND: B, L, D
- FLANK: F, L, K
- BLANK: B, L, K
- THANK: T, H, K
- SHANK: S, H, K
- STANK: S, T, K → but ""STANK"" is a word? Yes, past tense of stink? Or a valid word.
- SWANK: S, W, K → but pattern: S(1), W(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) → valid? SWANK is a word.

But we have to avoid using too many rare letters? We want common words.

Also, we can use Y? For example, ""SHINY""? But pattern: S,H,I,N,Y → I is absent → invalid.

""FUNKY""? F,U,N,K,Y → pattern: F(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5) → but we need position 3 to be A? Not N. So invalid.

So, I think the best are STAND, SLANT, THANK, etc.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test letters that are common and might appear in many words.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might be one of these.

We can also think: we have not tested S, T, L, D, H, K, etc.

If we choose STAND, we test S, T, D.

If we choose THANK, we test T, H, K.

But THANK has H and K? Which are less common than S and T? S and T are very common.

Similarly, SLANT tests S, L, T.

L is also common.

But we have to avoid using a letter that might be absent? We don't know.

Another word: ""SALAD""? But pattern: S,A,L,A,D → position 3 is L? Not A. Invalid.

""MANGA""? M,A,N,G,A → position 3 is N? Not A. Invalid.

So, let's go with STAND? But wait, we have to consider that if we guess STAND and it's wrong, we might not get much information? But we have to try.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses a vowel? The only vowel left is U? But where to put it?

For example, ""SULFA""? Not a common word.

""DUCAT""? D,U,C,A,T → C is absent → invalid.

""BULKY""? B,U,L,K,Y → pattern: B(1), U(2), L(3), K(4), Y(5) → but position 3 must be A? So invalid.

So, it seems difficult to include U. Therefore, we might not have a vowel in the other positions? The word might be like STAND, which is acceptable.

Therefore, I think STAND is a good choice: it tests three common consonants: S, T, D.

But note: in STAND, the first letter S? Common, second T? Common, fifth D? Common.

So, I'll go with STAND.

But let's see if there is a word that tests more letters? We can't, because we have to fix A and N.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has a Y? For example, ""SANDY"": S,A,N,D,Y → pattern: S(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5) → but we need position 3 to be A? In ""SANDY"", position 2 is A and position 3 is N? So that doesn't fit.

""WACKY""? W,A,C,K,Y → C absent → invalid.

So, I think STAND is a solid choice.

Therefore, next guess: STAND.

But wait: we have to make sure that the word is valid and not in the absent list.

STAND: S, T, A, N, D → no C, R, E, P, I, O → so valid.

So, <guess>stand</guess>

But let me double-check: the pattern is _ _ A N _ → STAND: position 1: S, position 2: T, position 3: A, position 4: N, position 5: D → matches.

Yes.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Crane**: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(x) → The secret word has **A** in position 3 and **N** in position 4, and does not contain **C**, **R**, or **E**.
- **Piano**: P(x), I(x), A(✓), N(✓), O(x) → **A** and **N** are confirmed in positions 3 and 4, and **P**, **I**, and **O** are not in the word.

The secret word pattern is: `_ _ A N _`  
Excluded letters: **C, E, I, O, P, R** (all marked ""x"" in previous feedback).

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** in position 3 and **N** in position 4.
- Cannot use any excluded letters (**C, E, I, O, P, R**).
- Focus on testing common unused consonants (e.g., **S, T, D, L, H, K**) to maximize information, as vowels are limited (only **U** or **Y** remain untested, but **A** is already confirmed).
- ""STAND"" is a strong choice because:
  - It fits the pattern (`S T A N D`).
  - It tests three new common consonants: **S**, **T**, and **D**.
  - All letters are distinct and valid, with no excluded characters.

<guess>stand</guess>",stand,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(x)
This means:
- C, R, E are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).

So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A N _ 
and does not contain C, R, E.

Second guess: ""piano"" → Feedback: P(x), I(x), A(✓), N(✓), O(x)
This means:
- P, I, O are not in the word at all.
- A and N are again confirmed in their correct positions (3 and 4).

So now we know:
- The secret word pattern: _ _ A N _
- The word does not contain: C, R, E, P, I, O.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, I, O. So the absent letters are: C, R, E, P, I, O.

We need to guess a 5-letter word that:
- Has the pattern: ? ? A N ? 
- Does not contain C, R, E, P, I, O.
- We should try to use common letters that haven't been tested yet.

Available letters: We have not tested many consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. And vowels: we have tested A (present), E, I, O (absent). The only vowel left is U? And sometimes Y.

But note: the word must have a vowel? Since A is already in the word, it might be the only vowel? Or there might be another? But we have to consider.

We need to form a word with pattern: _ _ A N _ 

Possible words? Let's think of common words.

We know the word must end with a consonant? Or vowel? We don't know.

Common words with ""AN"" in the middle? 

Examples:
- STAND: but S, T, A, N, D → but we haven't tested S, T, D. However, in our second guess we didn't test these? But STAND: S in position 1, T in position 2, D in position 5. But we have to avoid the absent letters? STAND does not contain C, R, E, P, I, O → so it's acceptable? But wait, we have to check if the letters are allowed.

But note: we have not received any feedback about S, T, D, so they might be present or absent.

But in STAND, we are testing S, T, D.

However, we have a problem: the feedback from the first guess told us that R is absent, and in STAND, there is no R? So it's okay.

But let me list possible words:

- STAND: S, T, A, N, D → pattern: S(1), T(2), A(3), N(4), D(5)
- SLAND? Not a common word.
- SLANT: S, L, A, N, T → pattern: S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5)
- PLANT: but P is absent → not allowed, because P is excluded.
- GIANT: G, I, A, N, T → but I is absent → not allowed.
- BLAND: B, L, A, N, D → pattern: B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), D(5) → and no excluded letters? B, L, D are new? Yes.

But we have to avoid I and O? BLAND: B, L, A, N, D → no I, O, etc. So acceptable.

Other words:
- GRAND: G, R, A, N, D → but R is absent → invalid.
- BRAND: same, R absent → invalid.
- FLANK: F, L, A, N, K → pattern: F(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) → valid? FLANK is a word? Yes.
- BLANK: B, L, A, N, K → pattern: B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) → valid.
- THANK: T, H, A, N, K → pattern: T(1), H(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) → valid.
- SHANK: S, H, A, N, K → pattern: S(1), H(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) → valid.

We have many options.

But we also have to consider that the word might have a vowel in position 1 or 2 or 5? The only vowel left is U and sometimes Y? Because A is already in position 3.

For example, words like ""HUMAN"": H,U,M,A,N → but then pattern: H(1), U(2), M(3), A(4), N(5) → but we need A in position 3? So that doesn't fit.

Another: ""WOMAN"": W,O,M,A,N → O is absent, and pattern: position 3 is M? Not A.

""MANLY"": M,A,N,L,Y → position 3 is N? Not A.

So, it seems that the words we have are mostly without vowels? But A is a vowel. The other positions can be consonants? For example, STAND, SLANT, BLAND, etc., are valid words without other vowels.

But what about words with U? For example, ""GUANO"": G,U,A,N,O → but O is absent → invalid.

""JUANA""? Not a common word? And J,U,A,N,A → but pattern: position 3 is A? J(1), U(2), A(3), N(4), A(5) → that could be? But ""JUANA"" is a proper noun? Not typically in Wordle? We should avoid.

Similarly, ""SUMAC"": S,U,M,A,C → but C is absent and pattern: position 3 is M? Not A.

So, it seems that the common words are consonant-heavy.

Now, we need to choose a word that tests new letters. We have to avoid the absent letters: C, R, E, P, I, O.

We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, P, I, O. So absent: C, R, E, P, I, O.

We have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to maximize information: test as many new common letters as possible.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.

In the pattern _ _ A N _, the first two letters and the last letter are to be guessed.

We can choose a word that uses common letters in these positions.

For example, STAND: tests S, T, D.

SLANT: tests S, L, T.

BLAND: tests B, L, D.

THANK: tests T, H, K.

We also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

Another idea: since we have only 6 tries, and we have 3 positions to figure out, we can try to cover more letters.

But note: we have 3 unknown positions, but the letters in those positions must form a valid word with A and N fixed.

We can also consider that the secret word might have one of the letters we test in the wrong position? But we are forced to put A and N in the correct positions.

So, let's list the possible words we can guess:

- STAND: S, T, D
- SLANT: S, L, T
- BLAND: B, L, D
- FLANK: F, L, K
- BLANK: B, L, K
- THANK: T, H, K
- SHANK: S, H, K
- STANK: S, T, K → but ""STANK"" is a word? Yes, past tense of stink? Or a valid word.
- SWANK: S, W, K → but pattern: S(1), W(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) → valid? SWANK is a word.

But we have to avoid using too many rare letters? We want common words.

Also, we can use Y? For example, ""SHINY""? But pattern: S,H,I,N,Y → I is absent → invalid.

""FUNKY""? F,U,N,K,Y → pattern: F(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5) → but we need position 3 to be A? Not N. So invalid.

So, I think the best are STAND, SLANT, THANK, etc.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test letters that are common and might appear in many words.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might be one of these.

We can also think: we have not tested S, T, L, D, H, K, etc.

If we choose STAND, we test S, T, D.

If we choose THANK, we test T, H, K.

But THANK has H and K? Which are less common than S and T? S and T are very common.

Similarly, SLANT tests S, L, T.

L is also common.

But we have to avoid using a letter that might be absent? We don't know.

Another word: ""SALAD""? But pattern: S,A,L,A,D → position 3 is L? Not A. Invalid.

""MANGA""? M,A,N,G,A → position 3 is N? Not A. Invalid.

So, let's go with STAND? But wait, we have to consider that if we guess STAND and it's wrong, we might not get much information? But we have to try.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses a vowel? The only vowel left is U? But where to put it?

For example, ""SULFA""? Not a common word.

""DUCAT""? D,U,C,A,T → C is absent → invalid.

""BULKY""? B,U,L,K,Y → pattern: B(1), U(2), L(3), K(4), Y(5) → but position 3 must be A? So invalid.

So, it seems difficult to include U. Therefore, we might not have a vowel in the other positions? The word might be like STAND, which is acceptable.

Therefore, I think STAND is a good choice: it tests three common consonants: S, T, D.

But note: in STAND, the first letter S? Common, second T? Common, fifth D? Common.

So, I'll go with STAND.

But let's see if there is a word that tests more letters? We can't, because we have to fix A and N.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has a Y? For example, ""SANDY"": S,A,N,D,Y → pattern: S(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5) → but we need position 3 to be A? In ""SANDY"", position 2 is A and position 3 is N? So that doesn't fit.

""WACKY""? W,A,C,K,Y → C absent → invalid.

So, I think STAND is a solid choice.

Therefore, next guess: STAND.

But wait: we have to make sure that the word is valid and not in the absent list.

STAND: S, T, A, N, D → no C, R, E, P, I, O → so valid.

So, <guess>stand</guess>

But let me double-check: the pattern is _ _ A N _ → STAND: position 1: S, position 2: T, position 3: A, position 4: N, position 5: D → matches.

Yes.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Crane**: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(x) → The secret word has **A** in position 3 and **N** in position 4, and does not contain **C**, **R**, or **E**.
- **Piano**: P(x), I(x), A(✓), N(✓), O(x) → **A** and **N** are confirmed in positions 3 and 4, and **P**, **I**, and **O** are not in the word.

The secret word pattern is: `_ _ A N _`  
Excluded letters: **C, E, I, O, P, R** (all marked ""x"" in previous feedback).

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** in position 3 and **N** in position 4.
- Cannot use any excluded letters (**C, E, I, O, P, R**).
- Focus on testing common unused consonants (e.g., **S, T, D, L, H, K**) to maximize information, as vowels are limited (only **U** or **Y** remain untested, but **A** is already confirmed).
- ""STAND"" is a strong choice because:
  - It fits the pattern (`S T A N D`).
  - It tests three new common consonants: **S**, **T**, and **D**.
  - All letters are distinct and valid, with no excluded characters.",Guess 3: stand -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are playing Wordle. We have 6 tries to guess a 5-letter word.
 Since it's the first guess, we don't have any prior feedback. We want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word often uses common letters and has unique letters to cover more possibilities.

 Common letters in English: To cover vowels and common consonants, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", etc. are popular.

 After considering, I'll choose ""CRANE"". It includes the common vowels A, E and the consonants C, R, N which are common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

 Let me format the response as required.I am considering making a good first guess for the Wordle game. The goal is to maximize information by using common letters and covering multiple possibilities. Common advice is to include vowels and frequent consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It includes three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, increasing coverage.
- It tests positions for key letters that often appear in many words.

This will help narrow down possibilities significantly based on the feedback symbols (✓, -, or x) for each letter position.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(x)
Interpretation:
- C is not in the secret word at all (x).
- R is not in the secret word at all (x). Note: the R feedback is (x), meaning it's not in the word.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓). So, the second letter of the secret word is A (since A is the third letter in ""crane"", but note: positions are 1-based? Wait, let's clarify).

In ""crane"", the letters are:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: E

Feedback:
- C (position 1): x → not in word
- R (position 2): x → not in word
- A (position 3): ✓ → correct position → so the secret word's third letter is A.
- N (position 4): ✓ → correct position → so the secret word's fourth letter is N.
- E (position 5): x → not in word

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has the letter A in the third position and N in the fourth position.
- The secret word does not contain C, R, or E at all.
- Since R is not in the word, and C and E are also out.

We need to make a second guess. The secret word format: _ _ A N _ 

The first, second, and fifth letters are unknown, but we know they cannot be C, R, E (and also note that the letters we've guessed which aren't in the word are C, R, E; also, from the feedback, R is out).

We must guess a valid 5-letter word that fits:
- Third letter: A
- Fourth letter: N
- The word must not contain C, R, E.

Also, we want to maximize information. Since we already have positions 3 and 4 fixed, we focus on guessing the other positions.

We'll try to pick a word that has:
- A in position 3 and N in position 4 (to confirm, but actually we know these are fixed, so we must keep them? Actually, we can change them? 

Wait: in Wordle, the fixed positions remain fixed for correctness, but for the purpose of testing other letters, we may choose to use different letters in those fixed positions? But no: since we know A is fixed at position 3, we shouldn't change it? Actually, we know it's A and N in those positions, so we must keep them in our guess? Not necessarily: we can try to test other letters even if it means moving A and N? But wait: because we have ✓, that means the letter A is in the word and in the third position. Therefore, the third position must be A and it must remain A. Similarly for the fourth position.

So, our next guess must have:
- Third letter: A
- Fourth letter: N

Other constraints:
- The word must not contain C, R, E.
- And note: letters that are not in the word at all (from previous x) cannot appear.

Now, what about the other letters? We need to guess letters for positions 1, 2, and 5.

Moreover, we want to choose a word that tests common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Potential words: 
Format: ? ? A N ? 

Common words: 
- B can be used? Let me think of words ending with ""AN"": 
Examples: 
- MANGA? But G might be new? And positions: M in 1, A in 2 (but wait our format: third letter is A, so if we say ""MANGA"": positions 1:M, 2:A, 3:N? Wait no: ""MANGA"" has M,A,N,G,A → but third letter is N, not A. So that doesn't work.

We need: letter1, letter2, A, N, letter5.

Examples of words: 
- PLAN: but PLAN is 4 letters.
- PLANTS: 6 letters, too long.
- Words that match the pattern: 
  - BRAND: but R is not allowed (R is excluded). We know R is not in the word.
  - STAND: S(1), T(2), A(3), N(4), D(5). But is that valid? Yes, STAND is a word.

Checking constraints:
- STAND: Positions: 
  1: S → is S allowed? We don't know if S is in the word or not, but not excluded yet.
  2: T
  3: A (fixed)
  4: N (fixed)
  5: D
Also, STAND does not contain C, R, E? It has S,T,A,N,D → no C, R, E → so acceptable.

But note: we must avoid R, and here we don't have R.

Are there other words? 
- SWANS: S,W,A,N,S → but third letter is A? ""SWANS"" → S(1), W(2), A(3), N(4), S(5) → that fits pattern. But ""SWANS"" has two S's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? Wordle allows duplicate letters? But the secret word might have duplicates? However, our pattern doesn't require duplicates. Let's consider.

But the feedback rules: If there is a duplicate in the guess and the secret word has one, it might show only the necessary ... but let's avoid complexity.

Another word: PHANTOM? too long.

SHANK: S,H,A,N,K → H and K? 

But I need to maximize information: using letters that are common and not yet tested.

We haven't tested many letters: Only C, R, A, N, E were tested. A and N are fixed and present. C, R, E are absent.

So, we must try new letters: e.g., vowels: we have A already, but O, I, U? Or consonants: S, T, D, L, etc.

STAND: uses S, T, D (and A, N). This tests S, T, D.

Other options:
- PIANO: P(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), O(5) → but O is new? Yes. Also tests P, I, O. But note: PIANO has no E, C, R? Yes.

But STAND seems more common? And PIANO might be less common? But both are valid.

Let's think: we know third and fourth letters are A and N, so we are only missing first, second, and fifth.

So, we can choose a word that uses common letters in positions 1, 2, and 5.

Common starting letters: S, L, T, etc.

Another word: LAIN? But 4 letters? 5 letters: PLAIN? But P,L,A,I,N? Wait: PLAIN → P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), N(5) → but wait, our fourth letter must be N? Then this would be: position 3:A, 4:N? But ""PLAIN"" has A in position 3, but N in position 5? So pattern: position 4 should be N, but in PLAIN it's I? So that doesn't fit.

So, we must have:

Position 1,2: ??
Position 3: A
Position 4: N
Position 5: ?

So, two letters before A and one after.

Other than STAND, we have:
- BEANS: B,E,A,N,S → but E is excluded -> not allowed.
- WEANS? Not a valid word. 
- MEANS: M,E,A,N,S → E is excluded -> invalid.
- LEANS: L,E,A,N,S → E excluded? invalid.
- DEANS: D,E,A,N,S → E excluded.

So without E? 
- BRAND: B,R,A,N,D → but R excluded -> invalid.
- SLAND? Not a commonly used word? And it might be invalid.

Valid words:
- STAND (as I thought)
- SHAND? Not common.
- WANLY? W,A,N,L,Y → but then position 3 would be N? wait: W(1), A(2), N(3), L(4), Y(5) → but we need A at position 3? So that doesn't fit.

We must have pattern: __ A N _

So:
- STAND: valid.
- PIANO: P,I,A,N,O → yes, letters: P,I,O → none excluded, and pattern fits: P(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), O(5).
- GIANT: G,I,A,N,T → pattern: G(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). Also tests G, I, T.
- BIANO? Not a word.
- ALIGN: A,L,I,G,N → but this has A in position 1 and then L,I,G,N → position 3 is I, so not A? So doesn't fit pattern.

Similarly, words like ""URBAN"": U,R,B,A,N → R excluded and also position 3 is A? U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4), N(5) → no, position 3 is B.

So, the good options are STAND, PIANO, GIANT.

Now, which gives more information? 
- STAND: tests S,T,D (and A,N)
- PIANO: tests P,I,O
- GIANT: tests G,I,T

We already know A and N are present and fixed.

We want to test new common vowels? We have A already, so O and I are important. 

In STAND: has T and D (and S), no vowel except A? 
In PIANO: has two vowels: I and O? So that might cover more vowels.

Also, in the feedback, we might get which of these are in the word and their positions.

But note: STAND has S at the beginning? Maybe more common?

Also, considering letter distribution: 
- We have to avoid C, R, E.

Another word: ""SPAIN"": but S,P,A,I,N → then position 4 is I? Then pattern: S,P,A,I,N → position 1:S, 2:P, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N → but we need position 4 to be N? So that's wrong.

Wait, no: we must have position 3=A and position 4=N.

Therefore, a word like ""SAINT"": S,A,I,N,T → S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) → but in this, position 3 is I? So A is not in position 3? Therefore, ""SAINT"" does not have A in position 3? We must have A in position 3? 

So, our pattern: ? in position 1, ? in position 2, then A in position 3, then N in position 4, then ? in position 5.

So, ""SAINT"" is S in 1, A in 2, I in 3 → but we need A in 3? That's different.

Therefore, the word must be:

Letter1, letter2, A, N, letter5.

Let me list common 5-letter words starting with (unknown) and ending with AN? Actually, not starting, but third and fourth fixed.

So, words: 
- PLAN: 4 letters.
- PLANE: E is excluded → invalid.
- PLANS: P,L,A,N,S → P(1),L(2),A(3),N(4),S(5) → valid? PLANS is a word. Tests P, L, S.

So PLANS: letters P, L, S.

Similarly, WEANS? Not a word. Means? Not valid. 

Other words:
- BRAND: contains R → invalid.
- STAND: valid. S, T, D?
- GRAND: G,R,A,N,D → R excluded → invalid.
- SLANT: S,L,A,N,T → valid. Tests S, L, T.
- PLANT: P,L,A,N,T → valid. Tests P, L, T.
- GIANT: G,I,A,N,T → valid. Tests G, I, T.
- PIANO: valid. P, I, O.

Between these: PLANS, STAND, SLANT, PLANT, GIANT, PIANO.

Now, we have not tested any letters except C, R, E, A, N. So almost all consonants and other vowels are available.

We want to test vowels: the word contains A, but we need to know about other vowels? The secret word might have O, I, U? Position 1 or 2 or 5.

In STAND, there are no vowels except A? 
STAND: S, T, A, N, D → no vowel? A is vowel? Yes, but we know it's present. Others? Not.

In GIANT: G, I, A, N, T → has I? vowel.

In PIANO: P, I, A, N, O → has I and O? vowels.

In PLANS: P, L, A, N, S → no vowel except A? same.

So PIANO tests three vowels: I, O, and A. Since A is fixed, but by testing I and O, we get information.

Also, PIANO uses more high-frequency letters? E is excluded? Already, so O and I are the next common vowels.

Therefore, I think PIANO is a good choice: 
- Tests P, I, O (and A and N as fixed).
- Position 1: P → test if P is in the word at position 1.
- Position 2: I → test if I is in the word and if it is at position 2 or not.
- Position 5: O → test if O is in the word at position 5.

And the word does not contain any excluded letters.

So, I choose ""PIANO"".

But note: the first letter P? We don't have any constraints.

Alternatively, GIANT tests G and I and T? But has only one new vowel: I.

But PIANO seems better.

Let me confirm: PIANO is 5 letters and valid? Yes.

Another option: MANGO? M,A,N,G,O → then position 1:M, 2:A? Wait: position 3 must be A? If MANGO: position1:M, position2:A, position3:N, position4:G, position5:O → but we need third letter A and fourth letter N? So mismatched: not the pattern. 

Therefore, PIANO fits: P in 1, I in 2, A in 3, N in 4, O in 5.

Yes.

So, I'll go with PIANO.

But note: the fifth letter might be O? We don't know.

We are still safe to test.

Therefore, next guess: PIANO.

<guess>piano</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- The third letter is **A** (correct position).
- The fourth letter is **N** (correct position).
- Letters **C**, **R**, and **E** are not in the secret word at all.

The secret word follows the pattern: `_ _ A N _`.

For the second guess:
- Must include **A** in position 3 and **N** in position 4.
- Cannot use **C**, **R**, or **E**.
- Avoid reusing incorrect letters to maximize new information.
- Focus on testing common letters and vowels (like **O** and **I**) that haven't been guessed yet.

""PIANO"" is a strong choice because:
- It fits the pattern (`P I A N O`).
- It tests new vowels (**O** and **I**) and consonants (**P**).
- All letters are distinct and valid.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: piano -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(x) A(✓) N(✓) O(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(x)
This means:
- C, R, E are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).

So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A N _ 
and does not contain C, R, E.

Second guess: ""piano"" → Feedback: P(x), I(x), A(✓), N(✓), O(x)
This means:
- P, I, O are not in the word at all.
- A and N are again confirmed in their correct positions (3 and 4).

So now we know:
- The secret word pattern: _ _ A N _
- The word does not contain: C, R, E, P, I, O.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, I, O. So the absent letters are: C, R, E, P, I, O.

We need to guess a 5-letter word that:
- Has the pattern: ? ? A N ? 
- Does not contain C, R, E, P, I, O.
- We should try to use common letters that haven't been tested yet.

Available letters: We have not tested many consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. And vowels: we have tested A (present), E, I, O (absent). The only vowel left is U? And sometimes Y.

But note: the word must have a vowel? Since A is already in the word, it might be the only vowel? Or there might be another? But we have to consider.

We need to form a word with pattern: _ _ A N _ 

Possible words? Let's think of common words.

We know the word must end with a consonant? Or vowel? We don't know.

Common words with ""AN"" in the middle? 

Examples:
- STAND: but S, T, A, N, D → but we haven't tested S, T, D. However, in our second guess we didn't test these? But STAND: S in position 1, T in position 2, D in position 5. But we have to avoid the absent letters? STAND does not contain C, R, E, P, I, O → so it's acceptable? But wait, we have to check if the letters are allowed.

But note: we have not received any feedback about S, T, D, so they might be present or absent.

But in STAND, we are testing S, T, D.

However, we have a problem: the feedback from the first guess told us that R is absent, and in STAND, there is no R? So it's okay.

But let me list possible words:

- STAND: S, T, A, N, D → pattern: S(1), T(2), A(3), N(4), D(5)
- SLAND? Not a common word.
- SLANT: S, L, A, N, T → pattern: S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5)
- PLANT: but P is absent → not allowed, because P is excluded.
- GIANT: G, I, A, N, T → but I is absent → not allowed.
- BLAND: B, L, A, N, D → pattern: B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), D(5) → and no excluded letters? B, L, D are new? Yes.

But we have to avoid I and O? BLAND: B, L, A, N, D → no I, O, etc. So acceptable.

Other words:
- GRAND: G, R, A, N, D → but R is absent → invalid.
- BRAND: same, R absent → invalid.
- FLANK: F, L, A, N, K → pattern: F(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) → valid? FLANK is a word? Yes.
- BLANK: B, L, A, N, K → pattern: B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) → valid.
- THANK: T, H, A, N, K → pattern: T(1), H(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) → valid.
- SHANK: S, H, A, N, K → pattern: S(1), H(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) → valid.

We have many options.

But we also have to consider that the word might have a vowel in position 1 or 2 or 5? The only vowel left is U and sometimes Y? Because A is already in position 3.

For example, words like ""HUMAN"": H,U,M,A,N → but then pattern: H(1), U(2), M(3), A(4), N(5) → but we need A in position 3? So that doesn't fit.

Another: ""WOMAN"": W,O,M,A,N → O is absent, and pattern: position 3 is M? Not A.

""MANLY"": M,A,N,L,Y → position 3 is N? Not A.

So, it seems that the words we have are mostly without vowels? But A is a vowel. The other positions can be consonants? For example, STAND, SLANT, BLAND, etc., are valid words without other vowels.

But what about words with U? For example, ""GUANO"": G,U,A,N,O → but O is absent → invalid.

""JUANA""? Not a common word? And J,U,A,N,A → but pattern: position 3 is A? J(1), U(2), A(3), N(4), A(5) → that could be? But ""JUANA"" is a proper noun? Not typically in Wordle? We should avoid.

Similarly, ""SUMAC"": S,U,M,A,C → but C is absent and pattern: position 3 is M? Not A.

So, it seems that the common words are consonant-heavy.

Now, we need to choose a word that tests new letters. We have to avoid the absent letters: C, R, E, P, I, O.

We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, P, I, O. So absent: C, R, E, P, I, O.

We have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to maximize information: test as many new common letters as possible.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.

In the pattern _ _ A N _, the first two letters and the last letter are to be guessed.

We can choose a word that uses common letters in these positions.

For example, STAND: tests S, T, D.

SLANT: tests S, L, T.

BLAND: tests B, L, D.

THANK: tests T, H, K.

We also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

Another idea: since we have only 6 tries, and we have 3 positions to figure out, we can try to cover more letters.

But note: we have 3 unknown positions, but the letters in those positions must form a valid word with A and N fixed.

We can also consider that the secret word might have one of the letters we test in the wrong position? But we are forced to put A and N in the correct positions.

So, let's list the possible words we can guess:

- STAND: S, T, D
- SLANT: S, L, T
- BLAND: B, L, D
- FLANK: F, L, K
- BLANK: B, L, K
- THANK: T, H, K
- SHANK: S, H, K
- STANK: S, T, K → but ""STANK"" is a word? Yes, past tense of stink? Or a valid word.
- SWANK: S, W, K → but pattern: S(1), W(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) → valid? SWANK is a word.

But we have to avoid using too many rare letters? We want common words.

Also, we can use Y? For example, ""SHINY""? But pattern: S,H,I,N,Y → I is absent → invalid.

""FUNKY""? F,U,N,K,Y → pattern: F(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5) → but we need position 3 to be A? Not N. So invalid.

So, I think the best are STAND, SLANT, THANK, etc.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test letters that are common and might appear in many words.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might be one of these.

We can also think: we have not tested S, T, L, D, H, K, etc.

If we choose STAND, we test S, T, D.

If we choose THANK, we test T, H, K.

But THANK has H and K? Which are less common than S and T? S and T are very common.

Similarly, SLANT tests S, L, T.

L is also common.

But we have to avoid using a letter that might be absent? We don't know.

Another word: ""SALAD""? But pattern: S,A,L,A,D → position 3 is L? Not A. Invalid.

""MANGA""? M,A,N,G,A → position 3 is N? Not A. Invalid.

So, let's go with STAND? But wait, we have to consider that if we guess STAND and it's wrong, we might not get much information? But we have to try.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses a vowel? The only vowel left is U? But where to put it?

For example, ""SULFA""? Not a common word.

""DUCAT""? D,U,C,A,T → C is absent → invalid.

""BULKY""? B,U,L,K,Y → pattern: B(1), U(2), L(3), K(4), Y(5) → but position 3 must be A? So invalid.

So, it seems difficult to include U. Therefore, we might not have a vowel in the other positions? The word might be like STAND, which is acceptable.

Therefore, I think STAND is a good choice: it tests three common consonants: S, T, D.

But note: in STAND, the first letter S? Common, second T? Common, fifth D? Common.

So, I'll go with STAND.

But let's see if there is a word that tests more letters? We can't, because we have to fix A and N.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has a Y? For example, ""SANDY"": S,A,N,D,Y → pattern: S(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5) → but we need position 3 to be A? In ""SANDY"", position 2 is A and position 3 is N? So that doesn't fit.

""WACKY""? W,A,C,K,Y → C absent → invalid.

So, I think STAND is a solid choice.

Therefore, next guess: STAND.

But wait: we have to make sure that the word is valid and not in the absent list.

STAND: S, T, A, N, D → no C, R, E, P, I, O → so valid.

So, <guess>stand</guess>

But let me double-check: the pattern is _ _ A N _ → STAND: position 1: S, position 2: T, position 3: A, position 4: N, position 5: D → matches.

Yes.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Crane**: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(x) → The secret word has **A** in position 3 and **N** in position 4, and does not contain **C**, **R**, or **E**.
- **Piano**: P(x), I(x), A(✓), N(✓), O(x) → **A** and **N** are confirmed in positions 3 and 4, and **P**, **I**, and **O** are not in the word.

The secret word pattern is: `_ _ A N _`  
Excluded letters: **C, E, I, O, P, R** (all marked ""x"" in previous feedback).

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** in position 3 and **N** in position 4.
- Cannot use any excluded letters (**C, E, I, O, P, R**).
- Focus on testing common unused consonants (e.g., **S, T, D, L, H, K**) to maximize information, as vowels are limited (only **U** or **Y** remain untested, but **A** is already confirmed).
- ""STAND"" is a strong choice because:
  - It fits the pattern (`S T A N D`).
  - It tests three new common consonants: **S**, **T**, and **D**.
  - All letters are distinct and valid, with no excluded characters.

Actually, we can change them? \n\nWait: in Wordle, the fixed positions remain fixed for correctness, but for the purpose of testing other letters, we may choose to use different letters in those fixed positions? But no: since we know A is fixed at position 3, we shouldn\'t change it? Actually, we know it\'s A and N in those positions, so we must keep them in our guess? Not necessarily: we can try to test other letters even if it means moving A and N? But wait: because we have ✓, that means the letter A is in the word and in the third position. Therefore, the third position must be A and it must remain A. Similarly for the fourth position.\n\nSo, our next guess must have:\n- Third letter: A\n- Fourth letter: N\n\nOther constraints:\n- The word must not contain C, R, E.\n- And note: letters that are not in the word at all (from previous x) cannot appear.\n\nNow, what about the other letters?

A N ? \n\nCommon words: \n- B can be used? Let me think of words ending with ""AN"": \nExamples: \n- MANGA? But G might be new? And positions: M in 1, A in 2 (but wait our format: third letter is A, so if we say ""MANGA"": positions 1:M, 2:A, 3:N? Wait no: ""MANGA"" has M,A,N,G,A → but third letter is N, not A.

It has S,T,A,N,D → no C, R, E → so acceptable.\n\nBut note: we must avoid R, and here we don\'t have R.\n\nAre there other words? \n- SWANS: S,W,A,N,S → but third letter is A? ""SWANS"" → S(1), W(2), A(3), N(4), S(5) → that fits pattern. But ""SWANS"" has two S\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? Wordle allows duplicate letters? But the secret word might have duplicates? However, our pattern doesn\'t require duplicates. Let\'s consider.\n\nBut the feedback rules: If there is a duplicate in the guess and the secret word has one, it might show only the necessary ... but let\'s avoid complexity.\n\nAnother word: PHANTOM? too long.\n\nSHANK: S,H,A,N,K → H and K? \n\nBut I need to maximize information: using letters that are common and not yet tested.\n\nWe haven\'t tested many letters: Only C, R, A, N, E were tested. A and N are fixed and present. C, R, E are absent.\n\nSo, we must try new letters: e.g., vowels: we have A already, but O, I, U? Or consonants: S, T, D, L, etc.\n\nSTAND: uses S, T, D (and A, N). This tests S, T, D.\n\nOther options:\n- PIANO: P(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), O(5) → but O is new? Yes. Also tests P, I, O. But note: PIANO has no E, C, R? Yes.\n\nBut STAND seems more common? And PIANO might be less common? But both are valid.\n\nLet\'s think: we know third and fourth letters are A and N, so we are only missing first, second, and fifth.\n\nSo, we can choose a word that uses common letters in positions 1, 2, and 5.\n\nCommon starting letters: S, L, T, etc.\n\nAnother word: LAIN? But 4 letters? 5 letters: PLAIN? But P,L,A,I,N? Wait: PLAIN → P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), N(5) → but wait, our fourth letter must be N? Then this would be: position 3:A, 4:N? But ""PLAIN"" has A in position 3, but N in position 5? So pattern: position 4 should be N, but in PLAIN it\'s I? So that doesn\'t fit.\n\nSo, we must have:\n\nPosition 1,2: ??\nPosition 3: A\nPosition 4: N\nPosition 5: ?\n\nSo, two letters before A and one after.\n\nOther than STAND, we have:\n- BEANS: B,E,A,N,S → but E is excluded -> not allowed.\n- WEANS? Not a valid word. \n- MEANS: M,E,A,N,S → E is excluded -> invalid.\n- LEANS: L,E,A,N,S → E excluded? invalid.\n- DEANS: D,E,A,N,S → E excluded.\n\nSo without E? \n- BRAND: B,R,A,N,D → but R excluded -> invalid.\n- SLAND? Not a commonly used word? And it might be invalid.\n\nValid words:\n- STAND (as I thought)\n- SHAND? Not common.\n- WANLY? W,A,N,L,Y → but then position 3 would be N? wait: W(1), A(2), N(3), L(4), Y(5) → but we need A at position 3? So that doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe must have pattern: __ A N _\n\nSo:\n- STAND: valid.\n- PIANO: P,I,A,N,O → yes, letters: P,I,O → none excluded, and pattern fits: P(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), O(5).\n- GIANT: G,I,A,N,T → pattern: G(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). Also tests G, I, T.\n- BIANO? Not a word.\n- ALIGN: A,L,I,G,N → but this has A in position 1 and then L,I,G,N → position 3 is I, so not A? So doesn\'t fit pattern.\n\nSimilarly, words like ""URBAN"": U,R,B,A,N → R excluded and also position 3 is A? U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4), N(5) → no, position 3 is B.\n\nSo, the good options are STAND, PIANO, GIANT.\n\nNow, which gives more information? \n- STAND: tests S,T,D (and A,N)\n- PIANO: tests P,I,O\n- GIANT: tests G,I,T\n\nWe already know A and N are present and fixed.\n\nWe want to test new common vowels? We have A already, so O and I are important. \n\nIn STAND: has T and D (and S), no vowel except A? \nIn PIANO: has two vowels: I and O? So that might cover more vowels.\n\nAlso, in the feedback, we might get which of these are in the word and their positions.\n\nBut note: STAND has S at the beginning? Maybe more common?\n\nAlso, considering letter distribution: \n- We have to avoid C, R, E.\n\nAnother word: ""SPAIN"": but S,P,A,I,N → then position 4 is I? Then pattern: S,P,A,I,N → position 1:S, 2:P, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N → but we need position 4 to be N? So that\'s wrong.\n\nWait, no: we must have position 3=A and position 4=N.\n\nTherefore, a word like ""SAINT"": S,A,I,N,T → S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) → but in this, position 3 is I? So A is not in position 3? Therefore, ""SAINT"" does not have A in position 3? We must have A in position 3? \n\nSo, our pattern: ? in position 1, ? in position 2, then A in position 3, then N in position 4, then ? in position 5.\n\nSo, ""SAINT"" is S in 1, A in 2, I in 3 → but we need A in 3? That\'s different.\n\nTherefore, the word must be:\n\nLetter1, letter2, A, N, letter5.\n\nLet me list common 5-letter words starting with (unknown) and ending with AN? Actually, not starting, but third and fourth fixed.\n\nSo, words: \n- PLAN: 4 letters.\n- PLANE: E is excluded → invalid.\n- PLANS: P,L,A,N,S → P(1),L(2),A(3),N(4),S(5) → valid? PLANS is a word. Tests P, L, S.\n\nSo PLANS: letters P, L, S.\n\nSimilarly, WEANS? Not a word. Means? Not valid. \n\nOther words:\n- BRAND: contains R → invalid.\n- STAND: valid. S, T, D?\n- GRAND: G,R,A,N,D → R excluded → invalid.\n- SLANT: S,L,A,N,T → valid. Tests S, L, T.\n- PLANT: P,L,A,N,T → valid. Tests P, L, T.\n- GIANT: G,I,A,N,T → valid. Tests G, I, T.\n- PIANO: valid. P, I, O.\n\nBetween these: PLANS, STAND, SLANT, PLANT, GIANT, PIANO.\n\nNow, we have not tested any letters except C, R, E, A, N. So almost all consonants and other vowels are available.\n\nWe want to test vowels: the word contains A, but we need to know about other vowels? The secret word might have O, I, U? Position 1 or 2 or 5.\n\nIn STAND, there are no vowels except A? \nSTAND: S, T, A, N, D → no vowel? A is vowel? Yes, but we know it\'s present. Others? Not.\n\nIn GIANT: G, I, A, N, T → has I? vowel.\n\nIn PIANO: P, I, A, N, O → has I and O? vowels.\n\nIn PLANS: P, L, A, N, S → no vowel except A? same.\n\nSo PIANO tests three vowels: I, O, and A. Since A is fixed, but by testing I and O, we get information.\n\nAlso, PIANO uses more high-frequency letters? E is excluded? Already, so O and I are the next common vowels.\n\nTherefore, I think PIANO is a good choice: \n- Tests P, I, O (and A and N as fixed).\n- Position 1: P → test if P is in the word at position 1.\n- Position 2: I → test if I is in the word and if it is at position 2 or not.\n- Position 5: O → test if O is in the word at position 5.\n\nAnd the word does not contain any excluded letters.\n\nSo, I choose ""PIANO"".\n\nBut note: the first letter P? We don\'t have any constraints.\n\nAlternatively, GIANT tests G and I and T? But has only one new vowel: I.\n\nBut PIANO seems better.\n\nLet me confirm: PIANO is 5 letters and valid? Yes.\n\nAnother option: MANGO? M,A,N,G,O → then position 1:M, 2:A? Wait: position 3 must be A? If MANGO: position1:M, position2:A, position3:N, position4:G, position5:O → but we need third letter A and fourth letter N? So mismatched: not the pattern. \n\nTherefore, PIANO fits: P in 1, I in 2, A in 3, N in 4, O in 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with PIANO.\n\nBut note: the fifth letter might be O? We don\'t know.\n\nWe are still safe to test.\n\nTherefore, next guess: PIANO.\n\n<guess>piano</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- The third letter is **A** (correct position).\n- The fourth letter is **N** (correct position).\n- Letters **C**, **R**, and **E** are not in the secret word at all.\n\nThe secret word follows the pattern: `_ _ A N _`.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include **A** in position 3 and **N** in position 4.\n- Cannot use **C**, **R**, or **E**.\n- Avoid reusing incorrect letters to maximize new information.\n- Focus on testing common letters and vowels (like **O** and **I**) that haven\'t been guessed yet.\n\n""PIANO"" is a strong choice because:\n- It fits the pattern (`P I A N O`).\n- It tests new vowels (**O** and **I**) and consonants (**P**).\n- All letters are distinct and valid.\n\n<guess>piano</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: piano -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(x) A(✓) N(✓) O(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(x)\nThis means:\n- C, R, E are not in the word at all.\n- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).\n- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).\n\nSo the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A N _ \nand does not contain C, R, E.\n\nSecond guess: ""piano"" → Feedback: P(x), I(x), A(✓), N(✓), O(x)\nThis means:\n- P, I, O are not in the word at all.\n- A and N are again confirmed in their correct positions (3 and 4).\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word pattern: _ _ A N _\n- The word does not contain: C, R, E, P, I, O.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, I, O.

But wait, we have to check if the letters are allowed.\n\nBut note: we have not received any feedback about S, T, D, so they might be present or absent.\n\nBut in STAND, we are testing S, T, D.\n\nHowever, we have a problem: the feedback from the first guess told us that R is absent, and in STAND, there is no R? So it\'s okay.\n\nBut let me list possible words:\n\n- STAND: S, T, A, N, D → pattern: S(1), T(2), A(3), N(4), D(5)\n- SLAND? Not a common word.\n- SLANT: S, L, A, N, T → pattern: S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5)\n- PLANT: but P is absent → not allowed, because P is excluded.\n- GIANT: G, I, A, N, T → but I is absent → not allowed.\n- BLAND: B, L, A, N, D → pattern: B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), D(5) → and no excluded letters? B, L, D are new? Yes.\n\nBut we have to avoid I and O? BLAND: B, L, A, N, D → no I, O, etc. So acceptable.\n\nOther words:\n- GRAND: G, R, A, N, D → but R is absent → invalid.\n- BRAND: same, R absent → invalid.\n- FLANK: F, L, A, N, K → pattern: F(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) → valid? FLANK is a word? Yes.\n- BLANK: B, L, A, N, K → pattern: B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) → valid.\n- THANK: T, H, A, N, K → pattern: T(1), H(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) → valid.\n- SHANK: S, H, A, N, K → pattern: S(1), H(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) → valid.\n\nWe have many options.\n\nBut we also have to consider that the word might have a vowel in position 1 or 2 or 5? The only vowel left is U and sometimes Y? Because A is already in position 3.\n\nFor example, words like ""HUMAN"": H,U,M,A,N → but then pattern: H(1), U(2), M(3), A(4), N(5) → but we need A in position 3? So that doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother: ""WOMAN"": W,O,M,A,N → O is absent, and pattern: position 3 is M? Not A.\n\n""MANLY"": M,A,N,L,Y → position 3 is N? Not A.\n\nSo, it seems that the words we have are mostly without vowels? But A is a vowel. The other positions can be consonants? For example, STAND, SLANT, BLAND, etc., are valid words without other vowels.\n\nBut what about words with U? For example, ""GUANO"": G,U,A,N,O → but O is absent → invalid.\n\n""JUANA""? Not a common word? And J,U,A,N,A → but pattern: position 3 is A? J(1), U(2), A(3), N(4), A(5) → that could be? But ""JUANA"" is a proper noun? Not typically in Wordle? We should avoid.\n\nSimilarly, ""SUMAC"": S,U,M,A,C → but C is absent and pattern: position 3 is M? Not A.\n\nSo, it seems that the common words are consonant-heavy.\n\nNow, we need to choose a word that tests new letters. We have to avoid the absent letters: C, R, E, P, I, O.\n\nWe have tested: C, R, A, N, E, P, I, O. So absent: C, R, E, P, I, O.\n\nWe have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to maximize information: test as many new common letters as possible.\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.\n\nIn the pattern _ _ A N _, the first two letters and the last letter are to be guessed.\n\nWe can choose a word that uses common letters in these positions.\n\nFor example, STAND: tests S, T, D.\n\nSLANT: tests S, L, T.\n\nBLAND: tests B, L, D.\n\nTHANK: tests T, H, K.\n\nWe also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates yet.\n\nAnother idea: since we have only 6 tries, and we have 3 positions to figure out, we can try to cover more letters.\n\nBut note: we have 3 unknown positions, but the letters in those positions must form a valid word with A and N fixed.\n\nWe can also consider that the secret word might have one of the letters we test in the wrong position? But we are forced to put A and N in the correct positions.\n\nSo, let\'s list the possible words we can guess:\n\n- STAND: S, T, D\n- SLANT: S, L, T\n- BLAND: B, L, D\n- FLANK: F, L, K\n- BLANK: B, L, K\n- THANK: T, H, K\n- SHANK: S, H, K\n- STANK: S, T, K → but ""STANK"" is a word? Yes, past tense of stink? Or a valid word.\n- SWANK: S, W, K → but pattern: S(1), W(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) → valid? SWANK is a word.\n\nBut we have to avoid using too many rare letters? We want common words.\n\nAlso, we can use Y? For example, ""SHINY""? But pattern: S,H,I,N,Y → I is absent → invalid.\n\n""FUNKY""? F,U,N,K,Y → pattern: F(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5) → but we need position 3 to be A? Not N. So invalid.\n\nSo, I think the best are STAND, SLANT, THANK, etc.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test letters that are common and might appear in many words.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the secret word might be one of these.\n\nWe can also think: we have not tested S, T, L, D, H, K, etc.\n\nIf we choose STAND, we test S, T, D.\n\nIf we choose THANK, we test T, H, K.\n\nBut THANK has H and K? Which are less common than S and T? S and T are very common.\n\nSimilarly, SLANT tests S, L, T.\n\nL is also common.\n\nBut we have to avoid using a letter that might be absent? We don\'t know.\n\nAnother word: ""SALAD""? But pattern: S,A,L,A,D → position 3 is L? Not A. Invalid.\n\n""MANGA""? M,A,N,G,A → position 3 is N? Not A. Invalid.\n\nSo, let\'s go with STAND? But wait, we have to consider that if we guess STAND and it\'s wrong, we might not get much information? But we have to try.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that uses a vowel? The only vowel left is U? But where to put it?\n\nFor example, ""SULFA""? Not a common word.\n\n""DUCAT""? D,U,C,A,T → C is absent → invalid.\n\n""BULKY""? B,U,L,K,Y → pattern: B(1), U(2), L(3), K(4), Y(5) → but position 3 must be A? So invalid.\n\nSo, it seems difficult to include U. Therefore, we might not have a vowel in the other positions? The word might be like STAND, which is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, I think STAND is a good choice: it tests three common consonants: S, T, D.\n\nBut note: in STAND, the first letter S? Common, second T? Common, fifth D? Common.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with STAND.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word that tests more letters? We can\'t, because we have to fix A and N.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has a Y? For example, ""SANDY"": S,A,N,D,Y → pattern: S(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5) → but we need position 3 to be A? In ""SANDY"", position 2 is A and position 3 is N? So that doesn\'t fit.\n\n""WACKY""? W,A,C,K,Y → C absent → invalid.\n\nSo, I think STAND is a solid choice.\n\nTherefore, next guess: STAND.\n\nBut wait: we have to make sure that the word is valid and not in the absent list.\n\nSTAND: S, T, A, N, D → no C, R, E, P, I, O → so valid.\n\nSo, <guess>stand</guess>\n\nBut let me double-check: the pattern is _ _ A N _ → STAND: position 1: S, position 2: T, position 3: A, position 4: N, position 5: D → matches.\n\nYes.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Crane**: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(x) → The secret word has **A** in position 3 and **N** in position 4, and does not contain **C**, **R**, or **E**.\n- **Piano**: P(x), I(x), A(✓), N(✓), O(x) → **A** and **N** are confirmed in positions 3 and 4, and **P**, **I**, and **O** are not in the word.\n\nThe secret word pattern is: `_ _ A N _`  \nExcluded letters: **C, E, I, O, P, R** (all marked ""x"" in previous feedback).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **A** in position 3 and **N** in position 4.\n- Cannot use any excluded letters (**C, E, I, O, P, R**).\n- Focus on testing common unused consonants (e.g., **S, T, D, L, H, K**) to maximize information, as vowels are limited (only **U** or **Y** remain untested, but **A** is already confirmed).\n- ""STAND"" is a strong choice because:\n  - It fits the pattern (`S T A N D`).\n  - It tests three new common consonants: **S**, **T**, and **D**.\n  - All letters are distinct and valid, with no excluded characters.\n\n<guess>stand</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: piano -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(x) A(✓) N(✓) O(x)\nGuess 3: stand -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given three guesses and feedback:
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: piano -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(x) A(✓) N(✓) O(x)
Guess 3: stand -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(x)

Interpretation of feedback:
From guess 1:
- C and R and E are not in the word at all (x).
- A is in the correct position (3rd) (✓).
- N is in the correct position (4th) (✓).

So the word has pattern: ? ? A N ?

From guess 2:
- P, I, and O are not in the word at all (x).
- A and N are confirmed in positions 3 and 4 again (✓).

Now, guess 3: stand -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(x)
Meaning:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1) (✓). So the secret word starts with S.
- T is not in the word at all (x).
- A and N in their correct positions (so pattern holds: S _ A N _).
- D is not in the word at all (x).

Therefore, what we know now:
- The secret word is S _ A N _ 
- Definite positions: 
   - Position 1: S
   - Position 3: A
   - Position 4: N
- So the secret word: S ? A N ? 
- Only positions 2 and 5 are unknown.

Also, we know the letters that are NOT in the word from previous feedback:
- Absolutely absent: C, R, E, P, I, O, T, D (from the x's).
- We also have the letters that appeared: S, A, N are present (since ✓), but A and N are fixed.

Letters not tested? We have used: C, R, A, N, E, P, I, O, S, T, D.

Absent letters: C, R, E, P, I, O, T, D.

So the secret word cannot contain any of these: C, E, P, R, I, O, T, D.

Also, A, N, S are present and fixed.

Now, we have to guess the missing letters: position 2 and position 5.

We must choose a 5-letter word that starts with S, has A at position 3, N at position 4, and avoids the absent letters.

So, pattern: S ? A N ?

With ? as positions 2 and 5.

What are possible letters for position 2 and 5? They must be letters not in the absent list and not S, A, N (since S, A, N are already used? But word can have duplicate letters? Possible, but we haven't seen indication of duplicates yet).

However, in the absent letters, we have T and D, but we just learned T is absent from the third guess? And D is absent. 

Available letters: We must avoid: C, R, E, P, I, O, T, D.

Also, S, A, N are in the word but already used? Position 2 could be another S? Or A or N? But A is at position 3, and N at position 4. So position 2 could be S? But the word ""S S A N ?"" ?

For example, ""SSAN?""? That might not be a word.

Position 5 could be S? But we have S at position 1? So a word like ""S_AN S""? 

What words fit the pattern? 

Common words: 

- SWANS: S, W, A, N, S → pattern: S(1), W(2), A(3), N(4), S(5) → but S is repeated? Is that allowed? Wordle allows duplicate letters? Yes, but we have to check.

SWANS: letters W, S (at the end). Does it avoid absent letters? 
- Position 2: W → not in absent list? 
- Position 5: S → S is present? But we know S is in the word? However, in feedback, if duplicate, the marking can be tricky? But let's proceed.

Is W in the absent list? No? 

But does SWANS avoid the absent letters? The letters are S, W, A, N, S? We have to check: 
- C: no
- E: no
- P: no
- I: no
- O: no
- T: no
- D: no
- R: no

So yes.

Another word: ""SLANG"": S, L, A, N, G → pattern: S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), G(5) 

Now, L and G? Not in the absent list.

Also, ""SLAND""? Not a common word.

""SWANK"": S, W, A, N, K → pattern: S(1), W(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) → valid? Yes, SWANK is a word.

But we have to consider potential words: 
- SLANG: S L A N G → tests L and G.
- SWANS: S W A N S → tests W and S (duplicate).
- SHANK: S H A N K → tests H and K.
- STANK: S T A N K → but T is absent! So cannot, because T is excluded.

T is in the absent list? From guess 3: T(x) → not in the word.

Similarly, D is absent.

So, STANK is invalid.

Other: ""SPANK"": S P A N K → but P is absent → invalid.

""SCANT"": S C A N T → C absent, T absent → invalid.

Therefore, possible words are those with position 2: a letter not in {C,E,P,I,O,T,R,D} and position 5: a letter not in that set, and not introducing new absent? But we must make a guess.

We don't know which letters are present? We know S, A, N are present and fixed. Position 2 and 5 could be other letters.

Available letters: from English alphabet, excluding absent: A,B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But A, S, N are already used? But duplicate allowed? So they could use A,S,N again? But A is at position 3 and N at position 4? Position 2 could be S? But then ""S S A N ?"" → what word? SSANS? Not a word.

Position 2 could be A? ""S A A N ?"" → SAAN? Not common.

Similarly, N: ""S N A N ?"" → SNAN? Not common.

So, likely, position 2 and 5 are new distinct letters.

Possible words: 
- S L A N G → SLANG
- S L A N D → but D absent → invalid.
- S W A N S → SWANS
- S W A N K → SWANK
- S H A N K → SHANK
- S H A N D → D absent? Invalid.
- S K A N K → SKANK? Valid? But meaning and commonality? 
- S M A N G → SMANG? Not common.
- S U A N G → SUANG? Not common.

Therefore, common words: 
- SLANG: meaning language, etc.
- SWANS: birds.
- SWANK: style? 
- SHANK: part of leg or prison weapon.

Also, ""SLANK""? Not a common word.

Another possibility: ""SPANG"" not common.

We have to choose one.

Also, note: we have to consider that if position 5 is S, that would be a duplicate? And we get feedback accordingly.

In SWANS, position 5 is S? That would mean the secret word has at least two S? But we don't know.

Similarly, for SHANK or SWANK? No duplicates? 

We have to make a guess to narrow down.

We know position 2 and 5 must be from: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? And avoid duplicates? Not necessary.

We want to test common letters? And to cover vowels? The only vowel available is U? Because A is in, and E,I,O are out.

So, we can try to include U? But where? Position 2? E.g., ""S U A N G""? Not a word.

""S U A N D → D absent? No.

So, it's hard to have U? So position 2 and 5 are likely consonants.

Therefore, we choose from SLANG, SWANS, SHANK, SWANK, etc.

Among these, SLANG and SWANS are more common? We can pick SLANG to test L and G? 

But note: if we guess SWANS, and the secret word has duplicate S? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can guess SWANS? But let's see.

We have two positions: position 2 and 5.

We can guess a word that uses a common letter? For example, L in position 2? In SLANG.

If we guess SLANG, and the feedback:

If position 2 is L? Then if L is in the correct position? Or if it is present but wrong? But we have ✓ only if correct.

Similarly for position 5? 

But we don't know what the secret word is.

But to maximize information: we have to choose one.

Since we only have 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4? We want to guess correctly? But we have 3 tries left.

Another idea: we can guess a word that tests two common letters? For example, SLANG has L and G? G is less common? H and K? 

SWANS has W and duplicate S? 

But S we know is at position 1, so if position 5 is S, that is new information.

But generally, L is more common than W? 

Perhaps SLANG is a better choice? 

In terms of word frequency: SLANG might be more common? But SWANS is also valid.

But we must choose.

Let's see if there is a word that tests vowels? But no.

Also, note: we have not tested H or K? 

So SHANK: tests H and K? H is common? 

We need to decide.

We know S is at 1, so position 2 must be a letter? If we guess SLANG, if L is at position 2? Then we get ✓ for position 2? Or if L is wrong? 

Similarly.

Perhaps list all possible words? But with the constraints:

Secret word: S X A N Z ? With X and Z not in the absent list? And avoiding C,E,P,I,O,T,R,D.

Possible X and Z: letters not absent and not S,A,N? Or can be? But S,A,N are allowed as duplicates? But not useful for positions.

So, possible:

Position 2 (X) and position 5 (Y) must be letters from: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words: 

- SLANG: L and G → B?
- SWANG: not common? SWANG? Not considered.
- SWANS: W and S → S duplicate? So Y=S? Which is at position 5? And that might be acceptable? But we know S is present? Then if S is also at position 5?
- SHANK: H and K → not bad? 
- SWANK: W and K → tests W and K.
- SLANK: not common.
- BLANK: but first letter fixed as S? So B cannot.
- So only words starting with S.

Other: ""SCAN""? 4 letters? 

""SPANK"" invalid.

So limited: 

- SHALL? But third letter A? S H A L L → then position 4 is L? But we need N at position 4? So invalid.

S A U N A? Then pattern: S(1), A(2), U(3), N(4), A(5) → but position 3 must be A? But if SAUNA, at position 3 is U? So invalid.

Therefore, SLANG, SWANS, SHANK, SWANK, plus maybe ""SMALL"" but not: S M A L L → position 4 must be N? Not L.

""STAMP"" not pattern.

So, we have: SLANG, SWANS, SHANK, SWANK.

Also, ""SKANK"" is slang? Might not be ideal? 

Given that, we can choose SLANG? Because it does not use duplicate? And L is common.

But SWANS uses W? Less common? 

To test a vowel? Impossible? So, let's choose SLANG.

But note: in the context, we have to win the game? 

Another word: ""SHOWN""? S H O W N → but O is absent → invalid.

So, I guess I'll go with SLANG.

So, next guess: SLANG.

But SLANG: positions S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), G(5)

And we avoid absent letters? L and G are not in the absent list? Yes.

So, <guess>slang</guess>

But let me confirm: 
- L is not: C,E,P,I,O,T,R,D?
- G is not? Yes.

So valid.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Summary of Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**: 
     - Letters not in the word: C, R, E.
     - Letters in correct positions: A (position 3), N (position 4).
   - **Guess 2 (piano)**:
     - Letters not in the word: P, I, O.
     - Letters in correct positions: A (position 3), N (position 4).
   - **Guess 3 (stand)**:
     - Letters not in the word: T, D.
     - Letter in correct position: S (position 1), A (position 3), N (position 4).
   - **Inferred Constraints**:
     - The secret word pattern: **S _ A N _** (positions 1, 3, and 4 are fixed as S, A, N).
     - Positions 2 and 5 are unknown.
     - Absent letters (cannot appear): C, E, I, O, P, R, T, D (all marked ""x"").
     - Letters already in correct positions: S, A, N.

2. **Pattern and Absent Letters**:
   - Secret word: **S ? A N ?** (5 letters).
   - Position 2 and Position 5 must be letters that are:
     - Not absent (avoid C, E, I, O, P, R, T, D).
     - Not conflicting with fixed positions.
     - Letters available: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - Duplicate letters are possible but less likely (no indication so far), and S/A/N are already used.

3. **Generating Possible Words**:
   - Possible words must start with ""S"", have ""A"" in position 3, ""N"" in position 4, and end with a valid letter from the available list.
   - Common options:
     - **SLANG**: Tests L (position 2) and G (position 5).
     - **SWANS**: Tests W (position 2) and S (position 5; duplicate S possible).
     - **SHANK**: Tests H (position 2) and K (position 5).
     - **SWANK**: Tests W (position 2) and K (position 5).
     - Other rare/less common: e.g., SKANK, SMALL (invalid due to position 4 L), SAUNA (invalid pattern).

4. **Selecting the Best Guess**:
   - Goal: Test high-frequency consonants (e.g., L, G, H, K) and cover new letters efficiently.
   - ""SLANG"" is chosen because:
     - It tests **L** (common consonant) and **G** (less common, but helps cover ground).
     - Avoids duplicates and uses distinct new letters.
     - Word is familiar and valid.
   - Alternatives like SWANS (tests repeated S) or SHANK/SWANK (tests K later) are viable but SLANG provides balanced coverage.

5. **Final Check**:
   - ""SLANG"": Positions— S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), G(5). 
   - No absent letters used (L and G are not in excluded set), and pattern matches S _ A N _.

This guess maximizes new information and reduces possibilities for the next step if incorrect.

<guess>slang</guess>",slang,"We are given three guesses and feedback:
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: piano -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(x) A(✓) N(✓) O(x)
Guess 3: stand -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(x)

Interpretation of feedback:
From guess 1:
- C and R and E are not in the word at all (x).
- A is in the correct position (3rd) (✓).
- N is in the correct position (4th) (✓).

So the word has pattern: ? ? A N ?

From guess 2:
- P, I, and O are not in the word at all (x).
- A and N are confirmed in positions 3 and 4 again (✓).

Now, guess 3: stand -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(x)
Meaning:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1) (✓). So the secret word starts with S.
- T is not in the word at all (x).
- A and N in their correct positions (so pattern holds: S _ A N _).
- D is not in the word at all (x).

Therefore, what we know now:
- The secret word is S _ A N _ 
- Definite positions: 
   - Position 1: S
   - Position 3: A
   - Position 4: N
- So the secret word: S ? A N ? 
- Only positions 2 and 5 are unknown.

Also, we know the letters that are NOT in the word from previous feedback:
- Absolutely absent: C, R, E, P, I, O, T, D (from the x's).
- We also have the letters that appeared: S, A, N are present (since ✓), but A and N are fixed.

Letters not tested? We have used: C, R, A, N, E, P, I, O, S, T, D.

Absent letters: C, R, E, P, I, O, T, D.

So the secret word cannot contain any of these: C, E, P, R, I, O, T, D.

Also, A, N, S are present and fixed.

Now, we have to guess the missing letters: position 2 and position 5.

We must choose a 5-letter word that starts with S, has A at position 3, N at position 4, and avoids the absent letters.

So, pattern: S ? A N ?

With ? as positions 2 and 5.

What are possible letters for position 2 and 5? They must be letters not in the absent list and not S, A, N (since S, A, N are already used? But word can have duplicate letters? Possible, but we haven't seen indication of duplicates yet).

However, in the absent letters, we have T and D, but we just learned T is absent from the third guess? And D is absent. 

Available letters: We must avoid: C, R, E, P, I, O, T, D.

Also, S, A, N are in the word but already used? Position 2 could be another S? Or A or N? But A is at position 3, and N at position 4. So position 2 could be S? But the word ""S S A N ?"" ?

For example, ""SSAN?""? That might not be a word.

Position 5 could be S? But we have S at position 1? So a word like ""S_AN S""? 

What words fit the pattern? 

Common words: 

- SWANS: S, W, A, N, S → pattern: S(1), W(2), A(3), N(4), S(5) → but S is repeated? Is that allowed? Wordle allows duplicate letters? Yes, but we have to check.

SWANS: letters W, S (at the end). Does it avoid absent letters? 
- Position 2: W → not in absent list? 
- Position 5: S → S is present? But we know S is in the word? However, in feedback, if duplicate, the marking can be tricky? But let's proceed.

Is W in the absent list? No? 

But does SWANS avoid the absent letters? The letters are S, W, A, N, S? We have to check: 
- C: no
- E: no
- P: no
- I: no
- O: no
- T: no
- D: no
- R: no

So yes.

Another word: ""SLANG"": S, L, A, N, G → pattern: S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), G(5) 

Now, L and G? Not in the absent list.

Also, ""SLAND""? Not a common word.

""SWANK"": S, W, A, N, K → pattern: S(1), W(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) → valid? Yes, SWANK is a word.

But we have to consider potential words: 
- SLANG: S L A N G → tests L and G.
- SWANS: S W A N S → tests W and S (duplicate).
- SHANK: S H A N K → tests H and K.
- STANK: S T A N K → but T is absent! So cannot, because T is excluded.

T is in the absent list? From guess 3: T(x) → not in the word.

Similarly, D is absent.

So, STANK is invalid.

Other: ""SPANK"": S P A N K → but P is absent → invalid.

""SCANT"": S C A N T → C absent, T absent → invalid.

Therefore, possible words are those with position 2: a letter not in {C,E,P,I,O,T,R,D} and position 5: a letter not in that set, and not introducing new absent? But we must make a guess.

We don't know which letters are present? We know S, A, N are present and fixed. Position 2 and 5 could be other letters.

Available letters: from English alphabet, excluding absent: A,B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But A, S, N are already used? But duplicate allowed? So they could use A,S,N again? But A is at position 3 and N at position 4? Position 2 could be S? But then ""S S A N ?"" → what word? SSANS? Not a word.

Position 2 could be A? ""S A A N ?"" → SAAN? Not common.

Similarly, N: ""S N A N ?"" → SNAN? Not common.

So, likely, position 2 and 5 are new distinct letters.

Possible words: 
- S L A N G → SLANG
- S L A N D → but D absent → invalid.
- S W A N S → SWANS
- S W A N K → SWANK
- S H A N K → SHANK
- S H A N D → D absent? Invalid.
- S K A N K → SKANK? Valid? But meaning and commonality? 
- S M A N G → SMANG? Not common.
- S U A N G → SUANG? Not common.

Therefore, common words: 
- SLANG: meaning language, etc.
- SWANS: birds.
- SWANK: style? 
- SHANK: part of leg or prison weapon.

Also, ""SLANK""? Not a common word.

Another possibility: ""SPANG"" not common.

We have to choose one.

Also, note: we have to consider that if position 5 is S, that would be a duplicate? And we get feedback accordingly.

In SWANS, position 5 is S? That would mean the secret word has at least two S? But we don't know.

Similarly, for SHANK or SWANK? No duplicates? 

We have to make a guess to narrow down.

We know position 2 and 5 must be from: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? And avoid duplicates? Not necessary.

We want to test common letters? And to cover vowels? The only vowel available is U? Because A is in, and E,I,O are out.

So, we can try to include U? But where? Position 2? E.g., ""S U A N G""? Not a word.

""S U A N D → D absent? No.

So, it's hard to have U? So position 2 and 5 are likely consonants.

Therefore, we choose from SLANG, SWANS, SHANK, SWANK, etc.

Among these, SLANG and SWANS are more common? We can pick SLANG to test L and G? 

But note: if we guess SWANS, and the secret word has duplicate S? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can guess SWANS? But let's see.

We have two positions: position 2 and 5.

We can guess a word that uses a common letter? For example, L in position 2? In SLANG.

If we guess SLANG, and the feedback:

If position 2 is L? Then if L is in the correct position? Or if it is present but wrong? But we have ✓ only if correct.

Similarly for position 5? 

But we don't know what the secret word is.

But to maximize information: we have to choose one.

Since we only have 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4? We want to guess correctly? But we have 3 tries left.

Another idea: we can guess a word that tests two common letters? For example, SLANG has L and G? G is less common? H and K? 

SWANS has W and duplicate S? 

But S we know is at position 1, so if position 5 is S, that is new information.

But generally, L is more common than W? 

Perhaps SLANG is a better choice? 

In terms of word frequency: SLANG might be more common? But SWANS is also valid.

But we must choose.

Let's see if there is a word that tests vowels? But no.

Also, note: we have not tested H or K? 

So SHANK: tests H and K? H is common? 

We need to decide.

We know S is at 1, so position 2 must be a letter? If we guess SLANG, if L is at position 2? Then we get ✓ for position 2? Or if L is wrong? 

Similarly.

Perhaps list all possible words? But with the constraints:

Secret word: S X A N Z ? With X and Z not in the absent list? And avoiding C,E,P,I,O,T,R,D.

Possible X and Z: letters not absent and not S,A,N? Or can be? But S,A,N are allowed as duplicates? But not useful for positions.

So, possible:

Position 2 (X) and position 5 (Y) must be letters from: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words: 

- SLANG: L and G → B?
- SWANG: not common? SWANG? Not considered.
- SWANS: W and S → S duplicate? So Y=S? Which is at position 5? And that might be acceptable? But we know S is present? Then if S is also at position 5?
- SHANK: H and K → not bad? 
- SWANK: W and K → tests W and K.
- SLANK: not common.
- BLANK: but first letter fixed as S? So B cannot.
- So only words starting with S.

Other: ""SCAN""? 4 letters? 

""SPANK"" invalid.

So limited: 

- SHALL? But third letter A? S H A L L → then position 4 is L? But we need N at position 4? So invalid.

S A U N A? Then pattern: S(1), A(2), U(3), N(4), A(5) → but position 3 must be A? But if SAUNA, at position 3 is U? So invalid.

Therefore, SLANG, SWANS, SHANK, SWANK, plus maybe ""SMALL"" but not: S M A L L → position 4 must be N? Not L.

""STAMP"" not pattern.

So, we have: SLANG, SWANS, SHANK, SWANK.

Also, ""SKANK"" is slang? Might not be ideal? 

Given that, we can choose SLANG? Because it does not use duplicate? And L is common.

But SWANS uses W? Less common? 

To test a vowel? Impossible? So, let's choose SLANG.

But note: in the context, we have to win the game? 

Another word: ""SHOWN""? S H O W N → but O is absent → invalid.

So, I guess I'll go with SLANG.

So, next guess: SLANG.

But SLANG: positions S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), G(5)

And we avoid absent letters? L and G are not in the absent list? Yes.

So, <guess>slang</guess>

But let me confirm: 
- L is not: C,E,P,I,O,T,R,D?
- G is not? Yes.

So valid.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Summary of Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**: 
     - Letters not in the word: C, R, E.
     - Letters in correct positions: A (position 3), N (position 4).
   - **Guess 2 (piano)**:
     - Letters not in the word: P, I, O.
     - Letters in correct positions: A (position 3), N (position 4).
   - **Guess 3 (stand)**:
     - Letters not in the word: T, D.
     - Letter in correct position: S (position 1), A (position 3), N (position 4).
   - **Inferred Constraints**:
     - The secret word pattern: **S _ A N _** (positions 1, 3, and 4 are fixed as S, A, N).
     - Positions 2 and 5 are unknown.
     - Absent letters (cannot appear): C, E, I, O, P, R, T, D (all marked ""x"").
     - Letters already in correct positions: S, A, N.

2. **Pattern and Absent Letters**:
   - Secret word: **S ? A N ?** (5 letters).
   - Position 2 and Position 5 must be letters that are:
     - Not absent (avoid C, E, I, O, P, R, T, D).
     - Not conflicting with fixed positions.
     - Letters available: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - Duplicate letters are possible but less likely (no indication so far), and S/A/N are already used.

3. **Generating Possible Words**:
   - Possible words must start with ""S"", have ""A"" in position 3, ""N"" in position 4, and end with a valid letter from the available list.
   - Common options:
     - **SLANG**: Tests L (position 2) and G (position 5).
     - **SWANS**: Tests W (position 2) and S (position 5; duplicate S possible).
     - **SHANK**: Tests H (position 2) and K (position 5).
     - **SWANK**: Tests W (position 2) and K (position 5).
     - Other rare/less common: e.g., SKANK, SMALL (invalid due to position 4 L), SAUNA (invalid pattern).

4. **Selecting the Best Guess**:
   - Goal: Test high-frequency consonants (e.g., L, G, H, K) and cover new letters efficiently.
   - ""SLANG"" is chosen because:
     - It tests **L** (common consonant) and **G** (less common, but helps cover ground).
     - Avoids duplicates and uses distinct new letters.
     - Word is familiar and valid.
   - Alternatives like SWANS (tests repeated S) or SHANK/SWANK (tests K later) are viable but SLANG provides balanced coverage.

5. **Final Check**:
   - ""SLANG"": Positions— S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), G(5). 
   - No absent letters used (L and G are not in excluded set), and pattern matches S _ A N _.

This guess maximizes new information and reduces possibilities for the next step if incorrect.",Guess 4: slang -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(✓) A(✓) N(✓) G(✓),SUCCESS
