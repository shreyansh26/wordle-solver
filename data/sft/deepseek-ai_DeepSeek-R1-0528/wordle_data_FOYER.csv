We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We can choose a word that covers frequent letters.

 Let's consider the frequency of letters in 5-letter English words. The most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc.

 A popular starting word is ""ROATE"" (which means the cumulative return from investments) but it's not very common. 
 Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is a good one because it has two vowels (A, I) and three common consonants (R, S, E).

 But note: the feedback symbols are case-sensitive? The example used uppercase. However, the rules don't specify. 
 We'll assume the game is case-insensitive for the word, but we'll output in uppercase as in the example.

 Another good starting word is ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E — all common letters.

 I think I'll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 However, let me check if ""CRANE"" is a valid 5-letter word. Yes, it is.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We have feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Interpretation:
- C is not in the word at all.
- R is in the word but not in the second position (where we guessed it).
- A is not in the word at all.
- N is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

So, we know:
- The word contains R and E, but not in the positions we guessed.
- The word does NOT contain C, A, N.

Since R is in the word but not in position 2, and E is in the word but not in position 5, and our guess had R in position 2 and E in position 5, they must be elsewhere.

Now, we need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word without C, A, N, and including R and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively? Actually, the position constraints: 
- R cannot be in position 2 (because feedback was R(-), meaning it's present but wrong position).
- E cannot be in position 5.

Moreover, since the word has R and E, and no C, A, N, we can list possible letters.

We also note that the word might have other letters. Since A and C are out, we should avoid vowels that are less common? We have E, so we focus on common consonants and vowels.

Common remaining letters: E, R, and others like O, I, T, S, L, etc.

But we know R is in the word, so we must include R. Similarly, E must be included.

In the new guess, we should place R in a position that is not 2, and E in a position that is not 5. Also, avoid positions 1,3,4 for R and E? Wait, the feedback doesn't say anything about positions 1,3,4 being correct or not for R and E? Actually:

- For R: only position 2 is wrong, so it could be in position 1,3,4, or even 5? But position 5 might be taken by E? Actually, E cannot be in position 5 in the secret word, so E must be in positions 1-4.

Similarly, R must be in positions 1,3,4, or 5? But we don't know about position 5 for R. Since E is in the word and not in position 5, R could be in position 5? Yes.

So constraints:
- The word must include R and E.
- R not in position 2.
- E not in position 5.
- No C, A, N.

Now, our goal is to guess a word that respects these constraints and uses common letters to test other positions.

We should also try to get information about other letters. Since E is in the word, let's think about possible positions.

Possible positions for E: since not at 5, it must be at 1,2,3, or 4.
Similarly for R: not at 2, so at 1,3,4,5.

We should avoid placing E in position 5 (already forbidden) and R in position 2.

But in our new guess, we can put E and R in any positions we want, remembering the feedback rules.

What word to choose? Let's think of common words with R and E, and without C, A, N.

Also, the word should not reuse letters that are already known absent: C, A, N.

We have already used C, R, A, N, E. From this, we know E and R are present, so we should reuse E and R in the new guess? But note: in Wordle-like games, reusing letters that are present is good to find their positions.

So, we must include R and E in our new guess.

We need a word that contains R and E, not containing C, A, N.

Possible words: 
- Words like ""ROBES"", ""STORE"", ""GUIDE"" (but GUIDEs has D and U, and E at end? We know E not at end? No, E not at position 5, so in STORE E is at 5, which is forbidden? Yes, so avoid words ending with E.

In the secret word, E cannot be at position 5, but in our guess, we can put E at any position? Yes, because we are testing. However, if we put E at position 5, we expect it to be marked x or -, but we know in the secret word E is not at position 5, so if we put E at 5, it will be wrong position? Actually, feedback: if we put E at 5, and E is in the word elsewhere, it will show -. If E is not at 5, and we guess E at 5, it will be wrong position only if E is present? Yes.

But to avoid wasting the E test, we should put E in a position where it might be correct, i.e., positions 1-4.

Similarly for R, avoid position 2.

So, good choices: put R in position 1,3,4, or 5; and E in position 1,2,3, or 4.

Now, what about the other letters? We need new letters to test.

Possible candidates:

- Words beginning with R: e.g., ""RESTS"", but S in it. But we don't know anything about S. However, ""RESTS"" has E at position 2 and R at 1, which we can test.

But ""RESTS"" has T and S, common letters.

But also, we want to use letters not yet tried? Yes, to get more information.

Letters tried so far: C, R, A, N, E. So we haven't tried S, T, O, I, L, etc.

Good words: ""RISES"" has I and S. But A is forbidden? Yes, but no A. However, ""RISES"" has R at 1, I at 2, S at 3, E at 4, S at 5. Position: E at 4, and R at 1 (which is not position 2). Good. And no C,A,N.

But in the secret word, E is present but not at position 5? Here E is at 4.

Possibly.

Word ""ROLES"": R at 1, O at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5. E at 4 (which is allowed for secret word), R at 1 (not position 2). Good.

But we need to see which one is better.

Another word: ""TRIES"" - T, R, I, E, S. Positions: R at 2? But R cannot be at position 2 because the feedback for our first guess told us R is not in position 2. So if we put R at position 2, it will be wrong again? No, the secret word has R, but not at position 2. So in a new position, we must avoid putting R at position 2 because we know it's not there.

In ""TRIES"": T position 1, R position 2. But R at position 2 in the guess would trigger a ""-"" because R is present but not in position 2. But we are not learning new? We are confirming that position 2 is wrong for R. But since we already know that, it's redundant.

To maximize new information, we should place R in a position where it might be correct, i.e., positions 1,3,4,5.

For example, ""TRIES"" with R at position 2 is inefficient because it re-tests position 2.

Better to put R at a new position.

Similarly for E, avoid position 5? But E at position 5: we know in secret word E is not at 5, so if we guess E at 5, we'll just get a ""-"" which tells us E is elsewhere, but we already know E is present. So it wastes a chance to pinpoint E's position? Yes.

Therefore, best to put E in one of positions 1-4 to see if that position is correct.

Similarly for R, put in positions 1,3,4,5 (avoiding 2).

Now, let's list possible words.

Option 1: ""PORTS"" - has P,O,R,T,S. But E is required? We must include E because we know E is in the word. If we don't include E, and E is in the word, we may miss it? But the word must contain E? No, our guess doesn't have to include E if we are testing other letters? But we know E is in the secret word, so to get information about E's position, we should include it? Not necessarily, but including E helps us to find its position.

Including E and R in the guess is efficient because we can test new positions.

If we skip E or R, we might get less information.

So prioritise words with both E and R.

Words with R and E, no C,A,N, E not at end? Optional in guess, but as reasoned, better to avoid E at 5 for new guess.

Some options:

- ""SERVE"": S, E, R, V, E? Letters: E at pos1, R at pos3, and E at pos5? But E at 5: since we know E is not at 5 in secret word, if we guess E at 5, we'll get ""-"" meaning E is present but not at that position. But we have two E's? And in ""SERVE"", E is at position 1 and 5.

But the secret word might or might not have duplicates? But in our first guess, we had no duplicates, so we don't know if duplicates are possible.

But to avoid complications, guess words without duplicates for now.

Better single E.

Word ""ROGUE"": R at 1, O at 2, G at 3, U at 4, E at 5. But E at 5: if we guess E at 5, and secret word E not at 5, we'll get ""-"". Also, U is less common.

Word ""RIDES"": R at 1, I at 2, D at 3, E at 4, S at 5. E at position 4 (good, not 5), R at position 1 (good, not 2). Also, includes D and S, which are untested.

Similarly, ""TREES"": T, R, E, E, S? Duplicate E, and R at 2? Avoid R at 2.

""DRIVE"": D at 1, R at 2? Avoid R at 2.

""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E. Positions: R at position 2? Avoid position 2 for R.

How about ""SPIRE"": S, P, I, R, E? E at position 5? Avoid E at 5 if possible. Put E at position 5? We'll get ""-"", but we could.

But to conserve, better put E in 1-4.

So back to ""RIDES"": R at 1, I at 2, D at 3, E at 4, S at 5. 
- R position 1: If R is at position 1 for secret word, we get ✓, else ""-"".
- E position 4: similar.
- Also tests I,D,S.

Another option: ""ROPES"": R at 1, O at 2, P at 3, E at 4, S at 5. Similarly.

""ROPES"" has O and P, which are common.

""RIDES"": R, I, D, E, S.

We also have ""REUSE"": R at 1? But ""REUSE"" has two E's? Not ideal. ""REUSE"": R, E, U, S, E? E at position 2 and 5.

Avoid.

Better ""RIDES"" or ""ROPES"", or ""TILES""? But TILES has T,I,L,E,S but no R? We must include R? Not mandatory for guess, but to test R, better include.

We know R is present, so including it can confirm position.

Option: ""RETCH"" but C is out? We have C as absent, ""RETCH"" has C? No, C is invalid? ""RETCH"" has C? The word contains C? Yes, so avoid.

""RESTS"": R, E, S, T, S? But R at position 1, E at position 2, S at 3 and 5? And T at 4? Good positions? E at 2: since E is present but not necessarily at 2. But we don't have any constraint on E position except not 5? And R not at 2. In ""RESTS"", R at 1 (okay), E at 2 (could be), and avoids E at 5.

Also, includes S and T, common letters.

But duplicate S? Not a problem necessarily.

Compared to ""RIDES"": both have S at the end? ""RESTS"" ends with S, ""RIDES"" also ends with S.

But ""RESTS"" might be better because it also has T.

But E is at position 2 in ""RESTS"", while in ""RIDES"" E is at 4.

We don't know which positions E might be.

Now, deciding between ""RESTS"" and ""RIDES"".

Perhaps ""STREP"", but that ends with P? ""STREP"": S,T,R,E,P. E at 4? R at 3? Positions: position1=S,2=T,3=R,4=E,5=P? Then S,T,R,E,P.

R is at position 3 (which is not 2, allowed), E at position 4 (not 5, avoided).

And includes S,T,P.

Also, all unique letters? ""STREP"" has S,T,R,E,P — unique letters.

Good candidate.

But ""STREP"" means a type of bacteria? Might be obscure. Is ""strep"" a valid common word? Not ideal.

Perhaps ""STRIP"" but no E? Must have E? Not required, but E is in word? We should include E.

Then ""SERVE"" as I thought earlier: S, E, R, V, E? E at 1 and 5? Duplicate E.

Bad.

""VERSE"": V,E,R,S,E? Duplicate E.

""GRIPE"": G,R,I,P,E? E at 5? We avoid E at 5.

But if we guess E at 5, we get ""-"" meaning E present but elsewhere.

But to save a position test, better not.

""GRIME"": G,R,I,M,E? E at 5.

Same.

""BRIDE"": B,R,I,D,E? B might be good? But we have to avoid B? No, only C,A,N are out. B hasn't been tried.

Positions: R at 2? Avoid R at 2. In ""BRIDE"", R is at 2? So position 2 for R? Bad.

Avoid R at 2: so for words, R should be first, third, fourth, or last.

Perhaps ""OREAD"": O,R,E,A,D? A is out? A is not allowed? We know A is not in word? Feedback said A(x), so absent, thus OREAD has A? Position 4? So invalid guess because A is out.

Thus avoid words containing A,C, or N.

So words must consist of letters not C,A,N.

Letters available: B,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But with R and E included.

Another word: ""WISER"": W,I,S,E,R? Positions: R at last position? R at 5? Good. E at position 4? Okay. And W,I,S.

""RIPER"": R,I,P,E,R? Duplicate R? Avoid.

Perhaps ""DRIFT"": D,R,I,F,T? No E? Omit E.

Yes, we can omit E since we know E is present, and it might be tested in later guesses? But better to include now.

""WRIST"": W,R,I,S,T? No E.

But E is known present, so guess should include E to find position.

Therefore, going back, ""RIDES"" seems good: R in position 1, E in position 4, and I,D,S are new.

""RIDES"" is a word? Yes, like horse rides.

Similarly, ""ROPES"" is also common.

""ROPES"" has O, which is vowel.

But both options are fine.

I think I choose ""RIDES"" for its commonality.

But ""RESTS"" might be more common? ""RESTS"" has duplicate S? But that's okay.

Another good one: ""STORE"" but E at 5? Avoid if possible.

How about ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E? But E at 5. No, E at 5 not desired. And no R? Omit R.

Must include R? Not enforced, but we know R is present so exclude?

If we guess without R, we might get feedback that misses the R position? But we can infer.

For example, if we guess ""STOLE"", we might:
- Get S, T, O, L, E feedback.
But E at 5, we know E is present but not at 5, so we'll get E(-).
But we also know R is present, but not in the guess, so the feedback won't tell us anything about R. Meaning, we won't test new positions for R.

To be efficient, better reuse known present letters R and E in new positions.

Therefore, I decide to use ""RIDES"": R in position 1, I in position 2, D in position 3, E in position 4, S in position 5.

So, guess: RIDES

Step-by-step reasoning: Since R is present but not at position 2, I place R at position 1 to test if it's there. E is present not at position 5, so I place at position 4. The word includes new letters I, D, S to gather more information.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- **C, A, N** are **not in the word**.
- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2**.
- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the second guess, I need to include both **R and E** (since they exist in the word) but avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5. I also cannot use **C, A, or N**. Ideally, the new guess should test new positions for R and E and introduce common unused letters to gather more information.

A strong candidate is **RIDES**:
- **R** is placed in **position 1** (a possible correct position; previously not tested).
- **E** is placed in **position 4** (avoiding position 5 and testing a new potential spot).
- **I, D, S** are new letters (common consonants/vowels not yet tested).
- Avoids all forbidden letters (no C, A, N) and aligns with constraints.

This should help narrow down the position of R and E while covering frequent English letters.

<guess>RIDES</guess>",RIDES,"We have feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Interpretation:
- C is not in the word at all.
- R is in the word but not in the second position (where we guessed it).
- A is not in the word at all.
- N is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

So, we know:
- The word contains R and E, but not in the positions we guessed.
- The word does NOT contain C, A, N.

Since R is in the word but not in position 2, and E is in the word but not in position 5, and our guess had R in position 2 and E in position 5, they must be elsewhere.

Now, we need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word without C, A, N, and including R and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively? Actually, the position constraints: 
- R cannot be in position 2 (because feedback was R(-), meaning it's present but wrong position).
- E cannot be in position 5.

Moreover, since the word has R and E, and no C, A, N, we can list possible letters.

We also note that the word might have other letters. Since A and C are out, we should avoid vowels that are less common? We have E, so we focus on common consonants and vowels.

Common remaining letters: E, R, and others like O, I, T, S, L, etc.

But we know R is in the word, so we must include R. Similarly, E must be included.

In the new guess, we should place R in a position that is not 2, and E in a position that is not 5. Also, avoid positions 1,3,4 for R and E? Wait, the feedback doesn't say anything about positions 1,3,4 being correct or not for R and E? Actually:

- For R: only position 2 is wrong, so it could be in position 1,3,4, or even 5? But position 5 might be taken by E? Actually, E cannot be in position 5 in the secret word, so E must be in positions 1-4.

Similarly, R must be in positions 1,3,4, or 5? But we don't know about position 5 for R. Since E is in the word and not in position 5, R could be in position 5? Yes.

So constraints:
- The word must include R and E.
- R not in position 2.
- E not in position 5.
- No C, A, N.

Now, our goal is to guess a word that respects these constraints and uses common letters to test other positions.

We should also try to get information about other letters. Since E is in the word, let's think about possible positions.

Possible positions for E: since not at 5, it must be at 1,2,3, or 4.
Similarly for R: not at 2, so at 1,3,4,5.

We should avoid placing E in position 5 (already forbidden) and R in position 2.

But in our new guess, we can put E and R in any positions we want, remembering the feedback rules.

What word to choose? Let's think of common words with R and E, and without C, A, N.

Also, the word should not reuse letters that are already known absent: C, A, N.

We have already used C, R, A, N, E. From this, we know E and R are present, so we should reuse E and R in the new guess? But note: in Wordle-like games, reusing letters that are present is good to find their positions.

So, we must include R and E in our new guess.

We need a word that contains R and E, not containing C, A, N.

Possible words: 
- Words like ""ROBES"", ""STORE"", ""GUIDE"" (but GUIDEs has D and U, and E at end? We know E not at end? No, E not at position 5, so in STORE E is at 5, which is forbidden? Yes, so avoid words ending with E.

In the secret word, E cannot be at position 5, but in our guess, we can put E at any position? Yes, because we are testing. However, if we put E at position 5, we expect it to be marked x or -, but we know in the secret word E is not at position 5, so if we put E at 5, it will be wrong position? Actually, feedback: if we put E at 5, and E is in the word elsewhere, it will show -. If E is not at 5, and we guess E at 5, it will be wrong position only if E is present? Yes.

But to avoid wasting the E test, we should put E in a position where it might be correct, i.e., positions 1-4.

Similarly for R, avoid position 2.

So, good choices: put R in position 1,3,4, or 5; and E in position 1,2,3, or 4.

Now, what about the other letters? We need new letters to test.

Possible candidates:

- Words beginning with R: e.g., ""RESTS"", but S in it. But we don't know anything about S. However, ""RESTS"" has E at position 2 and R at 1, which we can test.

But ""RESTS"" has T and S, common letters.

But also, we want to use letters not yet tried? Yes, to get more information.

Letters tried so far: C, R, A, N, E. So we haven't tried S, T, O, I, L, etc.

Good words: ""RISES"" has I and S. But A is forbidden? Yes, but no A. However, ""RISES"" has R at 1, I at 2, S at 3, E at 4, S at 5. Position: E at 4, and R at 1 (which is not position 2). Good. And no C,A,N.

But in the secret word, E is present but not at position 5? Here E is at 4.

Possibly.

Word ""ROLES"": R at 1, O at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5. E at 4 (which is allowed for secret word), R at 1 (not position 2). Good.

But we need to see which one is better.

Another word: ""TRIES"" - T, R, I, E, S. Positions: R at 2? But R cannot be at position 2 because the feedback for our first guess told us R is not in position 2. So if we put R at position 2, it will be wrong again? No, the secret word has R, but not at position 2. So in a new position, we must avoid putting R at position 2 because we know it's not there.

In ""TRIES"": T position 1, R position 2. But R at position 2 in the guess would trigger a ""-"" because R is present but not in position 2. But we are not learning new? We are confirming that position 2 is wrong for R. But since we already know that, it's redundant.

To maximize new information, we should place R in a position where it might be correct, i.e., positions 1,3,4,5.

For example, ""TRIES"" with R at position 2 is inefficient because it re-tests position 2.

Better to put R at a new position.

Similarly for E, avoid position 5? But E at position 5: we know in secret word E is not at 5, so if we guess E at 5, we'll just get a ""-"" which tells us E is elsewhere, but we already know E is present. So it wastes a chance to pinpoint E's position? Yes.

Therefore, best to put E in one of positions 1-4 to see if that position is correct.

Similarly for R, put in positions 1,3,4,5 (avoiding 2).

Now, let's list possible words.

Option 1: ""PORTS"" - has P,O,R,T,S. But E is required? We must include E because we know E is in the word. If we don't include E, and E is in the word, we may miss it? But the word must contain E? No, our guess doesn't have to include E if we are testing other letters? But we know E is in the secret word, so to get information about E's position, we should include it? Not necessarily, but including E helps us to find its position.

Including E and R in the guess is efficient because we can test new positions.

If we skip E or R, we might get less information.

So prioritise words with both E and R.

Words with R and E, no C,A,N, E not at end? Optional in guess, but as reasoned, better to avoid E at 5 for new guess.

Some options:

- ""SERVE"": S, E, R, V, E? Letters: E at pos1, R at pos3, and E at pos5? But E at 5: since we know E is not at 5 in secret word, if we guess E at 5, we'll get ""-"" meaning E is present but not at that position. But we have two E's? And in ""SERVE"", E is at position 1 and 5.

But the secret word might or might not have duplicates? But in our first guess, we had no duplicates, so we don't know if duplicates are possible.

But to avoid complications, guess words without duplicates for now.

Better single E.

Word ""ROGUE"": R at 1, O at 2, G at 3, U at 4, E at 5. But E at 5: if we guess E at 5, and secret word E not at 5, we'll get ""-"". Also, U is less common.

Word ""RIDES"": R at 1, I at 2, D at 3, E at 4, S at 5. E at position 4 (good, not 5), R at position 1 (good, not 2). Also, includes D and S, which are untested.

Similarly, ""TREES"": T, R, E, E, S? Duplicate E, and R at 2? Avoid R at 2.

""DRIVE"": D at 1, R at 2? Avoid R at 2.

""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E. Positions: R at position 2? Avoid position 2 for R.

How about ""SPIRE"": S, P, I, R, E? E at position 5? Avoid E at 5 if possible. Put E at position 5? We'll get ""-"", but we could.

But to conserve, better put E in 1-4.

So back to ""RIDES"": R at 1, I at 2, D at 3, E at 4, S at 5. 
- R position 1: If R is at position 1 for secret word, we get ✓, else ""-"".
- E position 4: similar.
- Also tests I,D,S.

Another option: ""ROPES"": R at 1, O at 2, P at 3, E at 4, S at 5. Similarly.

""ROPES"" has O and P, which are common.

""RIDES"": R, I, D, E, S.

We also have ""REUSE"": R at 1? But ""REUSE"" has two E's? Not ideal. ""REUSE"": R, E, U, S, E? E at position 2 and 5.

Avoid.

Better ""RIDES"" or ""ROPES"", or ""TILES""? But TILES has T,I,L,E,S but no R? We must include R? Not mandatory for guess, but to test R, better include.

We know R is present, so including it can confirm position.

Option: ""RETCH"" but C is out? We have C as absent, ""RETCH"" has C? No, C is invalid? ""RETCH"" has C? The word contains C? Yes, so avoid.

""RESTS"": R, E, S, T, S? But R at position 1, E at position 2, S at 3 and 5? And T at 4? Good positions? E at 2: since E is present but not necessarily at 2. But we don't have any constraint on E position except not 5? And R not at 2. In ""RESTS"", R at 1 (okay), E at 2 (could be), and avoids E at 5.

Also, includes S and T, common letters.

But duplicate S? Not a problem necessarily.

Compared to ""RIDES"": both have S at the end? ""RESTS"" ends with S, ""RIDES"" also ends with S.

But ""RESTS"" might be better because it also has T.

But E is at position 2 in ""RESTS"", while in ""RIDES"" E is at 4.

We don't know which positions E might be.

Now, deciding between ""RESTS"" and ""RIDES"".

Perhaps ""STREP"", but that ends with P? ""STREP"": S,T,R,E,P. E at 4? R at 3? Positions: position1=S,2=T,3=R,4=E,5=P? Then S,T,R,E,P.

R is at position 3 (which is not 2, allowed), E at position 4 (not 5, avoided).

And includes S,T,P.

Also, all unique letters? ""STREP"" has S,T,R,E,P — unique letters.

Good candidate.

But ""STREP"" means a type of bacteria? Might be obscure. Is ""strep"" a valid common word? Not ideal.

Perhaps ""STRIP"" but no E? Must have E? Not required, but E is in word? We should include E.

Then ""SERVE"" as I thought earlier: S, E, R, V, E? E at 1 and 5? Duplicate E.

Bad.

""VERSE"": V,E,R,S,E? Duplicate E.

""GRIPE"": G,R,I,P,E? E at 5? We avoid E at 5.

But if we guess E at 5, we get ""-"" meaning E present but elsewhere.

But to save a position test, better not.

""GRIME"": G,R,I,M,E? E at 5.

Same.

""BRIDE"": B,R,I,D,E? B might be good? But we have to avoid B? No, only C,A,N are out. B hasn't been tried.

Positions: R at 2? Avoid R at 2. In ""BRIDE"", R is at 2? So position 2 for R? Bad.

Avoid R at 2: so for words, R should be first, third, fourth, or last.

Perhaps ""OREAD"": O,R,E,A,D? A is out? A is not allowed? We know A is not in word? Feedback said A(x), so absent, thus OREAD has A? Position 4? So invalid guess because A is out.

Thus avoid words containing A,C, or N.

So words must consist of letters not C,A,N.

Letters available: B,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But with R and E included.

Another word: ""WISER"": W,I,S,E,R? Positions: R at last position? R at 5? Good. E at position 4? Okay. And W,I,S.

""RIPER"": R,I,P,E,R? Duplicate R? Avoid.

Perhaps ""DRIFT"": D,R,I,F,T? No E? Omit E.

Yes, we can omit E since we know E is present, and it might be tested in later guesses? But better to include now.

""WRIST"": W,R,I,S,T? No E.

But E is known present, so guess should include E to find position.

Therefore, going back, ""RIDES"" seems good: R in position 1, E in position 4, and I,D,S are new.

""RIDES"" is a word? Yes, like horse rides.

Similarly, ""ROPES"" is also common.

""ROPES"" has O, which is vowel.

But both options are fine.

I think I choose ""RIDES"" for its commonality.

But ""RESTS"" might be more common? ""RESTS"" has duplicate S? But that's okay.

Another good one: ""STORE"" but E at 5? Avoid if possible.

How about ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E? But E at 5. No, E at 5 not desired. And no R? Omit R.

Must include R? Not enforced, but we know R is present so exclude?

If we guess without R, we might get feedback that misses the R position? But we can infer.

For example, if we guess ""STOLE"", we might:
- Get S, T, O, L, E feedback.
But E at 5, we know E is present but not at 5, so we'll get E(-).
But we also know R is present, but not in the guess, so the feedback won't tell us anything about R. Meaning, we won't test new positions for R.

To be efficient, better reuse known present letters R and E in new positions.

Therefore, I decide to use ""RIDES"": R in position 1, I in position 2, D in position 3, E in position 4, S in position 5.

So, guess: RIDES

Step-by-step reasoning: Since R is present but not at position 2, I place R at position 1 to test if it's there. E is present not at position 5, so I place at position 4. The word includes new letters I, D, S to gather more information.Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- **C, A, N** are **not in the word**.
- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2**.
- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the second guess, I need to include both **R and E** (since they exist in the word) but avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5. I also cannot use **C, A, or N**. Ideally, the new guess should test new positions for R and E and introduce common unused letters to gather more information.

A strong candidate is **RIDES**:
- **R** is placed in **position 1** (a possible correct position; previously not tested).
- **E** is placed in **position 4** (avoiding position 5 and testing a new potential spot).
- **I, D, S** are new letters (common consonants/vowels not yet tested).
- Avoids all forbidden letters (no C, A, N) and aligns with constraints.

This should help narrow down the position of R and E while covering frequent English letters.",Guess 2: RIDES -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,FOYER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We can choose a word that covers frequent letters.

 Let's consider the frequency of letters in 5-letter English words. The most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc.

 A popular starting word is ""ROATE"" (which means the cumulative return from investments) but it's not very common. 
 Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is a good one because it has two vowels (A, I) and three common consonants (R, S, E).

 But note: the feedback symbols are case-sensitive? The example used uppercase. However, the rules don't specify. 
 We'll assume the game is case-insensitive for the word, but we'll output in uppercase as in the example.

 Another good starting word is ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E — all common letters.

 I think I'll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 However, let me check if ""CRANE"" is a valid 5-letter word. Yes, it is.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".I am starting the game and need to make my first guess. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word with common letters to maximize information. The most frequent letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, and N. A strong starting word should include several of these. ""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because it contains C (common consonant), R (2nd most common consonant), A (common vowel), N (common consonant), and E (most common vowel). This combination covers frequent letters and positions, helping me gather useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Interpretation:
- C is not in the word at all.
- R is in the word but not in the second position (where we guessed it).
- A is not in the word at all.
- N is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

So, we know:
- The word contains R and E, but not in the positions we guessed.
- The word does NOT contain C, A, N.

Since R is in the word but not in position 2, and E is in the word but not in position 5, and our guess had R in position 2 and E in position 5, they must be elsewhere.

Now, we need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word without C, A, N, and including R and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively? Actually, the position constraints: 
- R cannot be in position 2 (because feedback was R(-), meaning it's present but wrong position).
- E cannot be in position 5.

Moreover, since the word has R and E, and no C, A, N, we can list possible letters.

We also note that the word might have other letters. Since A and C are out, we should avoid vowels that are less common? We have E, so we focus on common consonants and vowels.

Common remaining letters: E, R, and others like O, I, T, S, L, etc.

But we know R is in the word, so we must include R. Similarly, E must be included.

In the new guess, we should place R in a position that is not 2, and E in a position that is not 5. Also, avoid positions 1,3,4 for R and E? Wait, the feedback doesn't say anything about positions 1,3,4 being correct or not for R and E? Actually:

- For R: only position 2 is wrong, so it could be in position 1,3,4, or even 5? But position 5 might be taken by E? Actually, E cannot be in position 5 in the secret word, so E must be in positions 1-4.

Similarly, R must be in positions 1,3,4, or 5? But we don't know about position 5 for R. Since E is in the word and not in position 5, R could be in position 5? Yes.

So constraints:
- The word must include R and E.
- R not in position 2.
- E not in position 5.
- No C, A, N.

Now, our goal is to guess a word that respects these constraints and uses common letters to test other positions.

We should also try to get information about other letters. Since E is in the word, let's think about possible positions.

Possible positions for E: since not at 5, it must be at 1,2,3, or 4.
Similarly for R: not at 2, so at 1,3,4,5.

We should avoid placing E in position 5 (already forbidden) and R in position 2.

But in our new guess, we can put E and R in any positions we want, remembering the feedback rules.

What word to choose? Let's think of common words with R and E, and without C, A, N.

Also, the word should not reuse letters that are already known absent: C, A, N.

We have already used C, R, A, N, E. From this, we know E and R are present, so we should reuse E and R in the new guess? But note: in Wordle-like games, reusing letters that are present is good to find their positions.

So, we must include R and E in our new guess.

We need a word that contains R and E, not containing C, A, N.

Possible words: 
- Words like ""ROBES"", ""STORE"", ""GUIDE"" (but GUIDEs has D and U, and E at end? We know E not at end? No, E not at position 5, so in STORE E is at 5, which is forbidden? Yes, so avoid words ending with E.

In the secret word, E cannot be at position 5, but in our guess, we can put E at any position? Yes, because we are testing. However, if we put E at position 5, we expect it to be marked x or -, but we know in the secret word E is not at position 5, so if we put E at 5, it will be wrong position? Actually, feedback: if we put E at 5, and E is in the word elsewhere, it will show -. If E is not at 5, and we guess E at 5, it will be wrong position only if E is present? Yes.

But to avoid wasting the E test, we should put E in a position where it might be correct, i.e., positions 1-4.

Similarly for R, avoid position 2.

So, good choices: put R in position 1,3,4, or 5; and E in position 1,2,3, or 4.

Now, what about the other letters? We need new letters to test.

Possible candidates:

- Words beginning with R: e.g., ""RESTS"", but S in it. But we don't know anything about S. However, ""RESTS"" has E at position 2 and R at 1, which we can test.

But ""RESTS"" has T and S, common letters.

But also, we want to use letters not yet tried? Yes, to get more information.

Letters tried so far: C, R, A, N, E. So we haven't tried S, T, O, I, L, etc.

Good words: ""RISES"" has I and S. But A is forbidden? Yes, but no A. However, ""RISES"" has R at 1, I at 2, S at 3, E at 4, S at 5. Position: E at 4, and R at 1 (which is not position 2). Good. And no C,A,N.

But in the secret word, E is present but not at position 5? Here E is at 4.

Possibly.

Word ""ROLES"": R at 1, O at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5. E at 4 (which is allowed for secret word), R at 1 (not position 2). Good.

But we need to see which one is better.

Another word: ""TRIES"" - T, R, I, E, S. Positions: R at 2? But R cannot be at position 2 because the feedback for our first guess told us R is not in position 2. So if we put R at position 2, it will be wrong again? No, the secret word has R, but not at position 2. So in a new position, we must avoid putting R at position 2 because we know it's not there.

In ""TRIES"": T position 1, R position 2. But R at position 2 in the guess would trigger a ""-"" because R is present but not in position 2. But we are not learning new? We are confirming that position 2 is wrong for R. But since we already know that, it's redundant.

To maximize new information, we should place R in a position where it might be correct, i.e., positions 1,3,4,5.

For example, ""TRIES"" with R at position 2 is inefficient because it re-tests position 2.

Better to put R at a new position.

Similarly for E, avoid position 5? But E at position 5: we know in secret word E is not at 5, so if we guess E at 5, we'll just get a ""-"" which tells us E is elsewhere, but we already know E is present. So it wastes a chance to pinpoint E's position? Yes.

Therefore, best to put E in one of positions 1-4 to see if that position is correct.

Similarly for R, put in positions 1,3,4,5 (avoiding 2).

Now, let's list possible words.

Option 1: ""PORTS"" - has P,O,R,T,S. But E is required? We must include E because we know E is in the word. If we don't include E, and E is in the word, we may miss it? But the word must contain E? No, our guess doesn't have to include E if we are testing other letters? But we know E is in the secret word, so to get information about E's position, we should include it? Not necessarily, but including E helps us to find its position.

Including E and R in the guess is efficient because we can test new positions.

If we skip E or R, we might get less information.

So prioritise words with both E and R.

Words with R and E, no C,A,N, E not at end? Optional in guess, but as reasoned, better to avoid E at 5 for new guess.

Some options:

- ""SERVE"": S, E, R, V, E? Letters: E at pos1, R at pos3, and E at pos5? But E at 5: since we know E is not at 5 in secret word, if we guess E at 5, we'll get ""-"" meaning E is present but not at that position. But we have two E's? And in ""SERVE"", E is at position 1 and 5.

But the secret word might or might not have duplicates? But in our first guess, we had no duplicates, so we don't know if duplicates are possible.

But to avoid complications, guess words without duplicates for now.

Better single E.

Word ""ROGUE"": R at 1, O at 2, G at 3, U at 4, E at 5. But E at 5: if we guess E at 5, and secret word E not at 5, we'll get ""-"". Also, U is less common.

Word ""RIDES"": R at 1, I at 2, D at 3, E at 4, S at 5. E at position 4 (good, not 5), R at position 1 (good, not 2). Also, includes D and S, which are untested.

Similarly, ""TREES"": T, R, E, E, S? Duplicate E, and R at 2? Avoid R at 2.

""DRIVE"": D at 1, R at 2? Avoid R at 2.

""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E. Positions: R at position 2? Avoid position 2 for R.

How about ""SPIRE"": S, P, I, R, E? E at position 5? Avoid E at 5 if possible. Put E at position 5? We'll get ""-"", but we could.

But to conserve, better put E in 1-4.

So back to ""RIDES"": R at 1, I at 2, D at 3, E at 4, S at 5. 
- R position 1: If R is at position 1 for secret word, we get ✓, else ""-"".
- E position 4: similar.
- Also tests I,D,S.

Another option: ""ROPES"": R at 1, O at 2, P at 3, E at 4, S at 5. Similarly.

""ROPES"" has O and P, which are common.

""RIDES"": R, I, D, E, S.

We also have ""REUSE"": R at 1? But ""REUSE"" has two E's? Not ideal. ""REUSE"": R, E, U, S, E? E at position 2 and 5.

Avoid.

Better ""RIDES"" or ""ROPES"", or ""TILES""? But TILES has T,I,L,E,S but no R? We must include R? Not mandatory for guess, but to test R, better include.

We know R is present, so including it can confirm position.

Option: ""RETCH"" but C is out? We have C as absent, ""RETCH"" has C? No, C is invalid? ""RETCH"" has C? The word contains C? Yes, so avoid.

""RESTS"": R, E, S, T, S? But R at position 1, E at position 2, S at 3 and 5? And T at 4? Good positions? E at 2: since E is present but not necessarily at 2. But we don't have any constraint on E position except not 5? And R not at 2. In ""RESTS"", R at 1 (okay), E at 2 (could be), and avoids E at 5.

Also, includes S and T, common letters.

But duplicate S? Not a problem necessarily.

Compared to ""RIDES"": both have S at the end? ""RESTS"" ends with S, ""RIDES"" also ends with S.

But ""RESTS"" might be better because it also has T.

But E is at position 2 in ""RESTS"", while in ""RIDES"" E is at 4.

We don't know which positions E might be.

Now, deciding between ""RESTS"" and ""RIDES"".

Perhaps ""STREP"", but that ends with P? ""STREP"": S,T,R,E,P. E at 4? R at 3? Positions: position1=S,2=T,3=R,4=E,5=P? Then S,T,R,E,P.

R is at position 3 (which is not 2, allowed), E at position 4 (not 5, avoided).

And includes S,T,P.

Also, all unique letters? ""STREP"" has S,T,R,E,P — unique letters.

Good candidate.

But ""STREP"" means a type of bacteria? Might be obscure. Is ""strep"" a valid common word? Not ideal.

Perhaps ""STRIP"" but no E? Must have E? Not required, but E is in word? We should include E.

Then ""SERVE"" as I thought earlier: S, E, R, V, E? E at 1 and 5? Duplicate E.

Bad.

""VERSE"": V,E,R,S,E? Duplicate E.

""GRIPE"": G,R,I,P,E? E at 5? We avoid E at 5.

But if we guess E at 5, we get ""-"" meaning E present but elsewhere.

But to save a position test, better not.

""GRIME"": G,R,I,M,E? E at 5.

Same.

""BRIDE"": B,R,I,D,E? B might be good? But we have to avoid B? No, only C,A,N are out. B hasn't been tried.

Positions: R at 2? Avoid R at 2. In ""BRIDE"", R is at 2? So position 2 for R? Bad.

Avoid R at 2: so for words, R should be first, third, fourth, or last.

Perhaps ""OREAD"": O,R,E,A,D? A is out? A is not allowed? We know A is not in word? Feedback said A(x), so absent, thus OREAD has A? Position 4? So invalid guess because A is out.

Thus avoid words containing A,C, or N.

So words must consist of letters not C,A,N.

Letters available: B,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But with R and E included.

Another word: ""WISER"": W,I,S,E,R? Positions: R at last position? R at 5? Good. E at position 4? Okay. And W,I,S.

""RIPER"": R,I,P,E,R? Duplicate R? Avoid.

Perhaps ""DRIFT"": D,R,I,F,T? No E? Omit E.

Yes, we can omit E since we know E is present, and it might be tested in later guesses? But better to include now.

""WRIST"": W,R,I,S,T? No E.

But E is known present, so guess should include E to find position.

Therefore, going back, ""RIDES"" seems good: R in position 1, E in position 4, and I,D,S are new.

""RIDES"" is a word? Yes, like horse rides.

Similarly, ""ROPES"" is also common.

""ROPES"" has O, which is vowel.

But both options are fine.

I think I choose ""RIDES"" for its commonality.

But ""RESTS"" might be more common? ""RESTS"" has duplicate S? But that's okay.

Another good one: ""STORE"" but E at 5? Avoid if possible.

How about ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E? But E at 5. No, E at 5 not desired. And no R? Omit R.

Must include R? Not enforced, but we know R is present so exclude?

If we guess without R, we might get feedback that misses the R position? But we can infer.

For example, if we guess ""STOLE"", we might:
- Get S, T, O, L, E feedback.
But E at 5, we know E is present but not at 5, so we'll get E(-).
But we also know R is present, but not in the guess, so the feedback won't tell us anything about R. Meaning, we won't test new positions for R.

To be efficient, better reuse known present letters R and E in new positions.

Therefore, I decide to use ""RIDES"": R in position 1, I in position 2, D in position 3, E in position 4, S in position 5.

So, guess: RIDES

Step-by-step reasoning: Since R is present but not at position 2, I place R at position 1 to test if it's there. E is present not at position 5, so I place at position 4. The word includes new letters I, D, S to gather more information.Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- **C, A, N** are **not in the word**.
- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2**.
- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the second guess, I need to include both **R and E** (since they exist in the word) but avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5. I also cannot use **C, A, or N**. Ideally, the new guess should test new positions for R and E and introduce common unused letters to gather more information.

A strong candidate is **RIDES**:
- **R** is placed in **position 1** (a possible correct position; previously not tested).
- **E** is placed in **position 4** (avoiding position 5 and testing a new potential spot).
- **I, D, S** are new letters (common consonants/vowels not yet tested).
- Avoids all forbidden letters (no C, A, N) and aligns with constraints.

This should help narrow down the position of R and E while covering frequent English letters.

A strong starting word should include several of these. ""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because it contains C (common consonant), R (2nd most common consonant), A (common vowel), N (common consonant), and E (most common vowel). This combination covers frequent letters and positions, helping me gather useful feedback for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)\nInterpretation:\n- C is not in the word at all.\n- R is in the word but not in the second position (where we guessed it).\n- A is not in the word at all.\n- N is not in the word at all.\n- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.\n\nSo, we know:\n- The word contains R and E, but not in the positions we guessed.\n- The word does NOT contain C, A, N.\n\nSince R is in the word but not in position 2, and E is in the word but not in position 5, and our guess had R in position 2 and E in position 5, they must be elsewhere.\n\nNow, we need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word without C, A, N, and including R and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively? Actually, the position constraints: \n- R cannot be in position 2 (because feedback was R(-), meaning it\'s present but wrong position).\n- E cannot be in position 5.\n\nMoreover, since the word has R and E, and no C, A, N, we can list possible letters.\n\nWe also note that the word might have other letters. Since A and C are out, we should avoid vowels that are less common? We have E, so we focus on common consonants and vowels.\n\nCommon remaining letters: E, R, and others like O, I, T, S, L, etc.\n\nBut we know R is in the word, so we must include R. Similarly, E must be included.\n\nIn the new guess, we should place R in a position that is not 2, and E in a position that is not 5. Also, avoid positions 1,3,4 for R and E? Wait, the feedback doesn\'t say anything about positions 1,3,4 being correct or not for R and E? Actually:\n\n- For R: only position 2 is wrong, so it could be in position 1,3,4, or even 5? But position 5 might be taken by E? Actually, E cannot be in position 5 in the secret word, so E must be in positions 1-4.\n\nSimilarly, R must be in positions 1,3,4, or 5? But we don\'t know about position 5 for R. Since E is in the word and not in position 5, R could be in position 5? Yes.\n\nSo constraints:\n- The word must include R and E.\n- R not in position 2.\n- E not in position 5.\n- No C, A, N.\n\nNow, our goal is to guess a word that respects these constraints and uses common letters to test other positions.\n\nWe should also try to get information about other letters. Since E is in the word, let\'s think about possible positions.\n\nPossible positions for E: since not at 5, it must be at 1,2,3, or 4.\nSimilarly for R: not at 2, so at 1,3,4,5.\n\nWe should avoid placing E in position 5 (already forbidden) and R in position 2.\n\nBut in our new guess, we can put E and R in any positions we want, remembering the feedback rules.\n\nWhat word to choose? Let\'s think of common words with R and E, and without C, A, N.\n\nAlso, the word should not reuse letters that are already known absent: C, A, N.\n\nWe have already used C, R, A, N, E. From this, we know E and R are present, so we should reuse E and R in the new guess? But note: in Wordle-like games, reusing letters that are present is good to find their positions.\n\nSo, we must include R and E in our new guess.\n\nWe need a word that contains R and E, not containing C, A, N.\n\nPossible words: \n- Words like ""ROBES"", ""STORE"", ""GUIDE"" (but GUIDEs has D and U, and E at end? We know E not at end? No, E not at position 5, so in STORE E is at 5, which is forbidden? Yes, so avoid words ending with E.\n\nIn the secret word, E cannot be at position 5, but in our guess, we can put E at any position? Yes, because we are testing. However, if we put E at position 5, we expect it to be marked x or -, but we know in the secret word E is not at position 5, so if we put E at 5, it will be wrong position? Actually, feedback: if we put E at 5, and E is in the word elsewhere, it will show -. If E is not at 5, and we guess E at 5, it will be wrong position only if E is present? Yes.\n\nBut to avoid wasting the E test, we should put E in a position where it might be correct, i.e., positions 1-4.\n\nSimilarly for R, avoid position 2.\n\nSo, good choices: put R in position 1,3,4, or 5; and E in position 1,2,3, or 4.\n\nNow, what about the other letters? We need new letters to test.\n\nPossible candidates:\n\n- Words beginning with R: e.g., ""RESTS"", but S in it. But we don\'t know anything about S. However, ""RESTS"" has E at position 2 and R at 1, which we can test.\n\nBut ""RESTS"" has T and S, common letters.\n\nBut also, we want to use letters not yet tried? Yes, to get more information.\n\nLetters tried so far: C, R, A, N, E. So we haven\'t tried S, T, O, I, L, etc.\n\nGood words: ""RISES"" has I and S. But A is forbidden? Yes, but no A. However, ""RISES"" has R at 1, I at 2, S at 3, E at 4, S at 5. Position: E at 4, and R at 1 (which is not position 2). Good. And no C,A,N.\n\nBut in the secret word, E is present but not at position 5? Here E is at 4.\n\nPossibly.\n\nWord ""ROLES"": R at 1, O at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5. E at 4 (which is allowed for secret word), R at 1 (not position 2). Good.\n\nBut we need to see which one is better.\n\nAnother word: ""TRIES"" - T, R, I, E, S. Positions: R at 2? But R cannot be at position 2 because the feedback for our first guess told us R is not in position 2. So if we put R at position 2, it will be wrong again? No, the secret word has R, but not at position 2. So in a new position, we must avoid putting R at position 2 because we know it\'s not there.\n\nIn ""TRIES"": T position 1, R position 2. But R at position 2 in the guess would trigger a ""-"" because R is present but not in position 2. But we are not learning new? We are confirming that position 2 is wrong for R. But since we already know that, it\'s redundant.\n\nTo maximize new information, we should place R in a position where it might be correct, i.e., positions 1,3,4,5.\n\nFor example, ""TRIES"" with R at position 2 is inefficient because it re-tests position 2.\n\nBetter to put R at a new position.\n\nSimilarly for E, avoid position 5? But E at position 5: we know in secret word E is not at 5, so if we guess E at 5, we\'ll just get a ""-"" which tells us E is elsewhere, but we already know E is present. So it wastes a chance to pinpoint E\'s position? Yes.\n\nTherefore, best to put E in one of positions 1-4 to see if that position is correct.\n\nSimilarly for R, put in positions 1,3,4,5 (avoiding 2).\n\nNow, let\'s list possible words.\n\nOption 1: ""PORTS"" - has P,O,R,T,S. But E is required? We must include E because we know E is in the word. If we don\'t include E, and E is in the word, we may miss it? But the word must contain E? No, our guess doesn\'t have to include E if we are testing other letters? But we know E is in the secret word, so to get information about E\'s position, we should include it? Not necessarily, but including E helps us to find its position.\n\nIncluding E and R in the guess is efficient because we can test new positions.\n\nIf we skip E or R, we might get less information.\n\nSo prioritise words with both E and R.\n\nWords with R and E, no C,A,N, E not at end? Optional in guess, but as reasoned, better to avoid E at 5 for new guess.\n\nSome options:\n\n- ""SERVE"": S, E, R, V, E? Letters: E at pos1, R at pos3, and E at pos5? But E at 5: since we know E is not at 5 in secret word, if we guess E at 5, we\'ll get ""-"" meaning E is present but not at that position. But we have two E\'s? And in ""SERVE"", E is at position 1 and 5.\n\nBut the secret word might or might not have duplicates? But in our first guess, we had no duplicates, so we don\'t know if duplicates are possible.\n\nBut to avoid complications, guess words without duplicates for now.\n\nBetter single E.\n\nWord ""ROGUE"": R at 1, O at 2, G at 3, U at 4, E at 5. But E at 5: if we guess E at 5, and secret word E not at 5, we\'ll get ""-"". Also, U is less common.\n\nWord ""RIDES"": R at 1, I at 2, D at 3, E at 4, S at 5. E at position 4 (good, not 5), R at position 1 (good, not 2). Also, includes D and S, which are untested.\n\nSimilarly, ""TREES"": T, R, E, E, S? Duplicate E, and R at 2? Avoid R at 2.\n\n""DRIVE"": D at 1, R at 2? Avoid R at 2.\n\n""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E. Positions: R at position 2? Avoid position 2 for R.\n\nHow about ""SPIRE"": S, P, I, R, E? E at position 5? Avoid E at 5 if possible. Put E at position 5? We\'ll get ""-"", but we could.\n\nBut to conserve, better put E in 1-4.\n\nSo back to ""RIDES"": R at 1, I at 2, D at 3, E at 4, S at 5. \n- R position 1: If R is at position 1 for secret word, we get ✓, else ""-"".\n- E position 4: similar.\n- Also tests I,D,S.\n\nAnother option: ""ROPES"": R at 1, O at 2, P at 3, E at 4, S at 5. Similarly.\n\n""ROPES"" has O and P, which are common.\n\n""RIDES"": R, I, D, E, S.\n\nWe also have ""REUSE"": R at 1? But ""REUSE"" has two E\'s? Not ideal. ""REUSE"": R, E, U, S, E? E at position 2 and 5.\n\nAvoid.\n\nBetter ""RIDES"" or ""ROPES"", or ""TILES""? But TILES has T,I,L,E,S but no R? We must include R? Not mandatory for guess, but to test R, better include.\n\nWe know R is present, so including it can confirm position.\n\nOption: ""RETCH"" but C is out? We have C as absent, ""RETCH"" has C? No, C is invalid? ""RETCH"" has C? The word contains C? Yes, so avoid.\n\n""RESTS"": R, E, S, T, S? But R at position 1, E at position 2, S at 3 and 5? And T at 4? Good positions? E at 2: since E is present but not necessarily at 2. But we don\'t have any constraint on E position except not 5? And R not at 2. In ""RESTS"", R at 1 (okay), E at 2 (could be), and avoids E at 5.\n\nAlso, includes S and T, common letters.\n\nBut duplicate S? Not a problem necessarily.\n\nCompared to ""RIDES"": both have S at the end?

""STREP"": S,T,R,E,P. E at 4? R at 3? Positions: position1=S,2=T,3=R,4=E,5=P? Then S,T,R,E,P.\n\nR is at position 3 (which is not 2, allowed), E at position 4 (not 5, avoided).\n\nAnd includes S,T,P.\n\nAlso, all unique letters? ""STREP"" has S,T,R,E,P — unique letters.\n\nGood candidate.\n\nBut ""STREP"" means a type of bacteria? Might be obscure. Is ""strep"" a valid common word? Not ideal.\n\nPerhaps ""STRIP"" but no E?

So position 2 for R? Bad.\n\nAvoid R at 2: so for words, R should be first, third, fourth, or last.\n\nPerhaps ""OREAD"": O,R,E,A,D? A is out? A is not allowed? We know A is not in word?

- R: present but wrong position (-) [since it was in position 2, but not there]
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-) [position 5 is wrong]

Second guess: RIDES
- R: present but wrong position (-) [we placed R at position 1, but it's not there]
- I: absent (x)
- D: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) [we placed E at position 4, and it is correct!]
- S: absent (x)

So, what do we know?
1. The secret word has the letter E in position 4. (Great! So E is fixed at the 4th position.)
2. The letter R is in the word, but it is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 1 (from second guess). So R must be in position 3 or 5? (Positions: 1,2,3,4,5; but position 4 is E, so R can be in 3 or 5.)
3. The following letters are absent: C, A, N, I, D, S. (So we cannot use these letters.)

Also, from the first guess, we know E is present and not at position 5, which is consistent because now we know E is at 4.

Now, the secret word has E at position 4, and R is present but not at 1 or 2. So R must be at position 3 or 5.

Additionally, we have no information about other letters. We have used: C, R, A, N, E, I, D, S. So absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need to form a 5-letter word that has E at position 4 and R at either position 3 or 5.

Also, the word must include R (since it's present) and we know E is at 4.

Now, for the third guess, we should try to determine the position of R and also test other letters.

We have two cases for R: position 3 or 5.

We can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we can only test one word.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R in position 3 and then see, or in position 5.

But we also want to test other common letters.

Since E is fixed at 4, the word pattern is: _ _ _ E _

And R must be in the third or fifth position.

So possible patterns: 
- If R is at 3: _ _ R E _
- If R is at 5: _ _ _ E R

We need to fill the other positions with new letters.

We should avoid the absent letters: C,A,N,I,D,S.

Let's think of words that fit these patterns.

First, pattern: _ _ R E _

Possible words: 
- With R at 3: e.g., ""CARE"" but C and A are out. Not possible.
- ""BARE"" but A is out.
- ""FIRE"" but I is out? I is absent? Yes, I is absent. So no.
- ""MORE"": M, O, R, E, ? -> but E is at 4, so ""MORE"" would be M O R E, but we need 5 letters? ""MORE"" is 4 letters. We need 5-letter words.

5-letter words with pattern _ _ R E _

Examples:
- ""STORE"" but S and T? S is absent, T is available? S is absent, so no.
- ""CHORE"" but C and H? C is absent, so no.
- ""WHORE"" but W,H,O,R,E? But O is available, but we have E at 4, so ""WHORE"" is W H O R E -> positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:O? No, we need R at position 3. ""WHORE"" has R at 4? W H O R E -> 1:W, 2:H, 3:O, 4:R, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, so position 4 must be E, but here it's R? Not matching.

We need the fourth letter to be E, so for pattern _ _ R E _, it means:
Position 1: ?
Position 2: ?
Position 3: R
Position 4: E
Position 5: ?

Similarly, for pattern _ _ _ E R: 
Position 1: ?
Position 2: ?
Position 3: ?
Position 4: E
Position 5: R

Now, let's find words for pattern 1: _ _ R E _

With available letters: no C,A,N,I,D,S.

Possible words:
- ""PARER"" but P,A,R,E,R? A is absent, and duplicate R? Also, E at 4? ""PARER"": P A R E R -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:R, 4:E, 5:R -> but A is absent, so invalid.
- ""MOVER"": M O V E R? But E is at 4? ""MOVER"": M O V E R -> 1:M, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R -> this is pattern _ _ _ E R, not _ _ R E _.

For pattern _ _ R E _:
- ""BORED"": B O R E D -> but D is absent? D is absent, so no.
- ""FOREX""? Not common word.
- ""GORED"": G O R E D -> D absent.
- ""HORDE"": H O R D E -> D absent, and E at 5? ""HORDE"" is H O R D E -> 1:H,2:O,3:R,4:D,5:E -> but we need E at 4, so position 4 is D? Not E. So no.

It seems hard to find a word for _ _ R E _ with the constraints.

Perhaps ""MURRE"" or ""PURGE""? 
- ""PURGE"": P U R G E -> 1:P, 2:U, 3:R, 4:G, 5:E -> position 4 is G, not E. So no.

We need position 4 to be E, so for pattern _ _ R E _, it must have E at position 4? No: the pattern is _ _ R E _, meaning:
Position 1: letter
Position 2: letter
Position 3: R
Position 4: E
Position 5: letter

But in ""PURGE"", position 4 is G, not E.

So we need a word where position 4 is E and position 3 is R? But we are considering the case where R is at position 3.

But in the word, position 4 is fixed as E, so if R is at 3, then we have ... R E ...

But let's list words ending with ""RE"" but that's position 4 and 5? No.

Perhaps it's easier to think of words that have E at position 4.

So the word must be: ? ? ? E ?

And R must be at 3 or 5.

Case 1: R at position 3: then word is ? ? R E ?
Case 2: R at position 5: then word is ? ? ? E R

Now, for case 1: ? ? R E ?

With available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding C,A,N,I,D,S)

Possible words:
- ""BORED"" -> B O R E D -> but D is absent, invalid.
- ""FIRED"" -> F I R E D -> I and D absent.
- ""HORDE"" -> H O R D E -> D absent, and E at 5? No, position 4 is D? H O R D E: pos4=D, pos5=E -> not E at 4.
- ""LURED"" -> L U R E D -> D absent.
- ""MURKY"" -> M U R K Y -> no E at 4? Position 4 is K, not E.
- ""PUREE"" -> P U R E E -> but E at 4 and 5? ""PUREE"": P U R E E -> pos1:P,2:U,3:R,4:E,5:E -> this fits: ? ? R E ? with ? at 1,2,5 being P,U,E? But E at 5 is duplicate? And E is at 4 and 5.

But the secret word has E at position 4, but it might have another E? We don't know. But in our first guess, we had E and it was not at 5, but now we know E is at 4, so position 5 could be E? But the feedback for first guess E(-) at position 5 means that E is not at 5, so the secret word does not have E at position 5. Therefore, position 5 cannot be E. So ""PUREE"" has E at 5, which would be invalid for secret word? But we are guessing, so we can guess it, but it would be inconsistent with what we know? No, we can guess it, but we know that if we guess E at 5, it will be marked absent (since E is not at 5) or if the word has duplicate E? But we don't know if duplicate E is possible.

But from first guess, E was not at 5, but it could be at 4 and also at 5? No, because if E were at 5, the first guess would have shown E as correct or wrong position? In first guess, we had E at position 5, and it was marked (-) meaning present but wrong position. That means E is in the word but not at position 5. So if E were also at position 4, it would still be marked present but not at 5. But the feedback doesn't tell us about position 4. So it's possible that E is at 4 and not at 5, and no duplicate.

But in ""PUREE"", we have E at 4 and 5, but we know E is not at 5, so for secret word, position 5 cannot be E. Therefore, ""PUREE"" as a guess is okay, but it has E at 5 which we know is wrong, so it will be marked as present but wrong position? But E is already at 4, which is correct, so position 5 E would be marked as absent? Let's think about feedback rules.

If the secret word has only one E, and we guess two E's, then:
- If we guess E at position 4 and it is correct, it gets ✓.
- If we guess E at position 5 and the secret word has no E at 5, it should be marked x (absent) if there is no second E? But the feedback for duplicate letters: typically in Wordle, if the letter appears once, and you guess it twice, the second one might be marked x if not present.

Standard Wordle rules: for duplicate letters, if the secret has one E, and you guess two E's, the first one in correct position gets ✓, and the second one in wrong position gets x (because there's no extra E). Or if the first one is in wrong position, it gets -, and the second one might get x.

But in this case, for ""PUREE"" as a guess:
- Position 4: E is correct, so ✓.
- Position 5: E is not in the secret word (since only one E at position 4), so it should be x.

But we are trying to guess, so it's acceptable, but it wastes a letter.

To avoid confusion, better to avoid duplicate letters in guess.

So back to finding words.

For case 1: ? ? R E ? with no C,A,N,I,D,S and no duplicate.

Possible words: 
- ""FOREMAN"" too long.
- 5-letter: ""FOREM"" not a word.
- ""GORED"" invalid.
- ""HOVER"" H O V E R -> but this is ? ? ? E R, not ? ? R E ?.

""BORNE"" but B O R N E -> N is absent.

""PURGE"" P U R G E -> positions: 1:P,2:U,3:R,4:G,5:E -> but position 4 is G, not E. We need position 4 to be E, so this has E at 5.

I think I'm confusing the pattern.

For case 1, we want R at position 3 and E at position 4, so the word must have letter3=R and letter4=E.

So words like X X R E X.

Examples:
- ""BREAD"" but B R E A D -> position 3 is E, not R? ""BREAD"": B at1, R at2, E at3, A at4, D at5 -> not matching.
- ""TREND"" T R E N D -> position 3 is E, not R.
- ""CREST"" C R E S T -> C and S absent, and position 3 is E.

We need position 3=R and position 4=E.

""FREED"" F R E E D -> duplicate E, and D absent.
""GREET"" G R E E T -> duplicate E.
""PREXY"" not a word.
""TREYF"" not a word.

It's difficult. Perhaps there are no common words with R at 3 and E at 4 with the available letters.

Let's try case 2: R at position 5, so pattern ? ? ? E R

Then the word is letter1, letter2, letter3, E, R.

With available letters.

Examples:
- ""LATER"" but A is absent.
- ""METER"" M E T E R -> duplicate E, and position 4 is E? ""METER"": M at1, E at2, T at3, E at4, R at5 -> but we need position 4 to be E, which it is, and position 5=R. But it has E at2 and E at4, so duplicate E. Also, E at2 is new? But we know E is at4, so E at2 might be absent or wrong position.

But duplicate.

""POWER"" P O W E R -> positions: P at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5 -> perfect! No duplicate, and letters P,O,W are available.

""POWER"" is a valid word.

Other options:
- ""TOWER"" T O W E R -> similar, T available.
- ""MOWER"" M O W E R -> M available.
- ""COVER"" but C absent.
- ""HOVER"" H O V E R -> H and V available.
- ""LOVER"" L O V E R -> L and V.

All good.

Now, we also have the possibility that R is at position 3, but we couldn't find a word, so maybe it's not likely? Or we missed a word.

Another word for case 1: ""BOREE"" not common.
""FORZE"" not word.

Perhaps ""QUREK"" not word.

So probably, the secret word is more likely to have R at position 5.

For the third guess, we can guess a word that has R at position 5 and E at position 4, and test other positions.

For example, ""POWER"": tests P at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.

If we guess this, and if R is indeed at position 5, we might get R(✓), and E(✓), and information about P,O,W.

If R is not at 5, then we will get R(-) for position 5, meaning R is present but not at 5, so it must be at position 3 (since positions 1 and 2 are ruled out).

But in that case, we would have to use a different word.

But with ""POWER"", we cover the case for R at 5 and also test three new letters.

Similarly, ""TOWER"" or ""MOWER"" are also good.

I think ""POWER"" is fine.

But let's see if we can include more common letters.

Available common letters: O, T, L, etc.

""LOWER"": L O W E R -> L at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.

""TOWER"": T O W E R.

All similar.

I'll go with ""POWER"".

But we have to make sure we don't use absent letters.

P, O, W, E, R: E and R are known, P,O,W not used before.

So guess ""POWER"".

But in the feedback, we might get:

- If R is at 5, then R(✓)
- E is at 4, so E(✓)
- Then P, O, W will be checked.

If R is not at 5, then R(-) meaning R is present but not at 5, so it must be at 3.

And then we know.

Also, if any of P,O,W are in the word, we get feedback.

So it's a good guess.

Therefore, third guess: POWER

Step-by-step:

- E is confirmed at position 4.
- R is present but not at position 1 or 2, so must be at 3 or 5.
- To test R at position 5 and introduce new common letters, guess ""POWER"" which places R at 5 and E at 4.
- This will either confirm R at position 5 or reveal that R must be at position 3 (if R is marked as present but wrong position at 5).
- Also tests P, O, W in positions 1, 2, and 3.

<guess>POWER</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **E is confirmed at position 4** (from Guess 2: E(✓)).
- **R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2** (from Guess 1: R(-) at position 2; Guess 2: R(-) at position 1). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 5.
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, I, D, S (marked ""x"" in feedback).
- **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the third guess, I need to:
- Test the position of R (position 3 or 5).
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.
- Keep E fixed at position 4.

A strong guess is **POWER**:
- **P, O, W** are new, common letters not yet tested.
- **E** is placed at position 4 (confirmed correct).
- **R** is placed at position 5 (testing if R is at position 5; if not, it must be at position 3).
- Avoids all absent letters (C, A, N, I, D, S).

This guess efficiently narrows down R's position while covering frequent English letters.

<guess>POWER</guess>",POWER,"We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: CRANE
- C: absent (x)
- R: present but wrong position (-) [since it was in position 2, but not there]
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-) [position 5 is wrong]

Second guess: RIDES
- R: present but wrong position (-) [we placed R at position 1, but it's not there]
- I: absent (x)
- D: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) [we placed E at position 4, and it is correct!]
- S: absent (x)

So, what do we know?
1. The secret word has the letter E in position 4. (Great! So E is fixed at the 4th position.)
2. The letter R is in the word, but it is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 1 (from second guess). So R must be in position 3 or 5? (Positions: 1,2,3,4,5; but position 4 is E, so R can be in 3 or 5.)
3. The following letters are absent: C, A, N, I, D, S. (So we cannot use these letters.)

Also, from the first guess, we know E is present and not at position 5, which is consistent because now we know E is at 4.

Now, the secret word has E at position 4, and R is present but not at 1 or 2. So R must be at position 3 or 5.

Additionally, we have no information about other letters. We have used: C, R, A, N, E, I, D, S. So absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need to form a 5-letter word that has E at position 4 and R at either position 3 or 5.

Also, the word must include R (since it's present) and we know E is at 4.

Now, for the third guess, we should try to determine the position of R and also test other letters.

We have two cases for R: position 3 or 5.

We can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we can only test one word.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R in position 3 and then see, or in position 5.

But we also want to test other common letters.

Since E is fixed at 4, the word pattern is: _ _ _ E _

And R must be in the third or fifth position.

So possible patterns: 
- If R is at 3: _ _ R E _
- If R is at 5: _ _ _ E R

We need to fill the other positions with new letters.

We should avoid the absent letters: C,A,N,I,D,S.

Let's think of words that fit these patterns.

First, pattern: _ _ R E _

Possible words: 
- With R at 3: e.g., ""CARE"" but C and A are out. Not possible.
- ""BARE"" but A is out.
- ""FIRE"" but I is out? I is absent? Yes, I is absent. So no.
- ""MORE"": M, O, R, E, ? -> but E is at 4, so ""MORE"" would be M O R E, but we need 5 letters? ""MORE"" is 4 letters. We need 5-letter words.

5-letter words with pattern _ _ R E _

Examples:
- ""STORE"" but S and T? S is absent, T is available? S is absent, so no.
- ""CHORE"" but C and H? C is absent, so no.
- ""WHORE"" but W,H,O,R,E? But O is available, but we have E at 4, so ""WHORE"" is W H O R E -> positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:O? No, we need R at position 3. ""WHORE"" has R at 4? W H O R E -> 1:W, 2:H, 3:O, 4:R, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, so position 4 must be E, but here it's R? Not matching.

We need the fourth letter to be E, so for pattern _ _ R E _, it means:
Position 1: ?
Position 2: ?
Position 3: R
Position 4: E
Position 5: ?

Similarly, for pattern _ _ _ E R: 
Position 1: ?
Position 2: ?
Position 3: ?
Position 4: E
Position 5: R

Now, let's find words for pattern 1: _ _ R E _

With available letters: no C,A,N,I,D,S.

Possible words:
- ""PARER"" but P,A,R,E,R? A is absent, and duplicate R? Also, E at 4? ""PARER"": P A R E R -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:R, 4:E, 5:R -> but A is absent, so invalid.
- ""MOVER"": M O V E R? But E is at 4? ""MOVER"": M O V E R -> 1:M, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R -> this is pattern _ _ _ E R, not _ _ R E _.

For pattern _ _ R E _:
- ""BORED"": B O R E D -> but D is absent? D is absent, so no.
- ""FOREX""? Not common word.
- ""GORED"": G O R E D -> D absent.
- ""HORDE"": H O R D E -> D absent, and E at 5? ""HORDE"" is H O R D E -> 1:H,2:O,3:R,4:D,5:E -> but we need E at 4, so position 4 is D? Not E. So no.

It seems hard to find a word for _ _ R E _ with the constraints.

Perhaps ""MURRE"" or ""PURGE""? 
- ""PURGE"": P U R G E -> 1:P, 2:U, 3:R, 4:G, 5:E -> position 4 is G, not E. So no.

We need position 4 to be E, so for pattern _ _ R E _, it must have E at position 4? No: the pattern is _ _ R E _, meaning:
Position 1: letter
Position 2: letter
Position 3: R
Position 4: E
Position 5: letter

But in ""PURGE"", position 4 is G, not E.

So we need a word where position 4 is E and position 3 is R? But we are considering the case where R is at position 3.

But in the word, position 4 is fixed as E, so if R is at 3, then we have ... R E ...

But let's list words ending with ""RE"" but that's position 4 and 5? No.

Perhaps it's easier to think of words that have E at position 4.

So the word must be: ? ? ? E ?

And R must be at 3 or 5.

Case 1: R at position 3: then word is ? ? R E ?
Case 2: R at position 5: then word is ? ? ? E R

Now, for case 1: ? ? R E ?

With available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding C,A,N,I,D,S)

Possible words:
- ""BORED"" -> B O R E D -> but D is absent, invalid.
- ""FIRED"" -> F I R E D -> I and D absent.
- ""HORDE"" -> H O R D E -> D absent, and E at 5? No, position 4 is D? H O R D E: pos4=D, pos5=E -> not E at 4.
- ""LURED"" -> L U R E D -> D absent.
- ""MURKY"" -> M U R K Y -> no E at 4? Position 4 is K, not E.
- ""PUREE"" -> P U R E E -> but E at 4 and 5? ""PUREE"": P U R E E -> pos1:P,2:U,3:R,4:E,5:E -> this fits: ? ? R E ? with ? at 1,2,5 being P,U,E? But E at 5 is duplicate? And E is at 4 and 5.

But the secret word has E at position 4, but it might have another E? We don't know. But in our first guess, we had E and it was not at 5, but now we know E is at 4, so position 5 could be E? But the feedback for first guess E(-) at position 5 means that E is not at 5, so the secret word does not have E at position 5. Therefore, position 5 cannot be E. So ""PUREE"" has E at 5, which would be invalid for secret word? But we are guessing, so we can guess it, but it would be inconsistent with what we know? No, we can guess it, but we know that if we guess E at 5, it will be marked absent (since E is not at 5) or if the word has duplicate E? But we don't know if duplicate E is possible.

But from first guess, E was not at 5, but it could be at 4 and also at 5? No, because if E were at 5, the first guess would have shown E as correct or wrong position? In first guess, we had E at position 5, and it was marked (-) meaning present but wrong position. That means E is in the word but not at position 5. So if E were also at position 4, it would still be marked present but not at 5. But the feedback doesn't tell us about position 4. So it's possible that E is at 4 and not at 5, and no duplicate.

But in ""PUREE"", we have E at 4 and 5, but we know E is not at 5, so for secret word, position 5 cannot be E. Therefore, ""PUREE"" as a guess is okay, but it has E at 5 which we know is wrong, so it will be marked as present but wrong position? But E is already at 4, which is correct, so position 5 E would be marked as absent? Let's think about feedback rules.

If the secret word has only one E, and we guess two E's, then:
- If we guess E at position 4 and it is correct, it gets ✓.
- If we guess E at position 5 and the secret word has no E at 5, it should be marked x (absent) if there is no second E? But the feedback for duplicate letters: typically in Wordle, if the letter appears once, and you guess it twice, the second one might be marked x if not present.

Standard Wordle rules: for duplicate letters, if the secret has one E, and you guess two E's, the first one in correct position gets ✓, and the second one in wrong position gets x (because there's no extra E). Or if the first one is in wrong position, it gets -, and the second one might get x.

But in this case, for ""PUREE"" as a guess:
- Position 4: E is correct, so ✓.
- Position 5: E is not in the secret word (since only one E at position 4), so it should be x.

But we are trying to guess, so it's acceptable, but it wastes a letter.

To avoid confusion, better to avoid duplicate letters in guess.

So back to finding words.

For case 1: ? ? R E ? with no C,A,N,I,D,S and no duplicate.

Possible words: 
- ""FOREMAN"" too long.
- 5-letter: ""FOREM"" not a word.
- ""GORED"" invalid.
- ""HOVER"" H O V E R -> but this is ? ? ? E R, not ? ? R E ?.

""BORNE"" but B O R N E -> N is absent.

""PURGE"" P U R G E -> positions: 1:P,2:U,3:R,4:G,5:E -> but position 4 is G, not E. We need position 4 to be E, so this has E at 5.

I think I'm confusing the pattern.

For case 1, we want R at position 3 and E at position 4, so the word must have letter3=R and letter4=E.

So words like X X R E X.

Examples:
- ""BREAD"" but B R E A D -> position 3 is E, not R? ""BREAD"": B at1, R at2, E at3, A at4, D at5 -> not matching.
- ""TREND"" T R E N D -> position 3 is E, not R.
- ""CREST"" C R E S T -> C and S absent, and position 3 is E.

We need position 3=R and position 4=E.

""FREED"" F R E E D -> duplicate E, and D absent.
""GREET"" G R E E T -> duplicate E.
""PREXY"" not a word.
""TREYF"" not a word.

It's difficult. Perhaps there are no common words with R at 3 and E at 4 with the available letters.

Let's try case 2: R at position 5, so pattern ? ? ? E R

Then the word is letter1, letter2, letter3, E, R.

With available letters.

Examples:
- ""LATER"" but A is absent.
- ""METER"" M E T E R -> duplicate E, and position 4 is E? ""METER"": M at1, E at2, T at3, E at4, R at5 -> but we need position 4 to be E, which it is, and position 5=R. But it has E at2 and E at4, so duplicate E. Also, E at2 is new? But we know E is at4, so E at2 might be absent or wrong position.

But duplicate.

""POWER"" P O W E R -> positions: P at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5 -> perfect! No duplicate, and letters P,O,W are available.

""POWER"" is a valid word.

Other options:
- ""TOWER"" T O W E R -> similar, T available.
- ""MOWER"" M O W E R -> M available.
- ""COVER"" but C absent.
- ""HOVER"" H O V E R -> H and V available.
- ""LOVER"" L O V E R -> L and V.

All good.

Now, we also have the possibility that R is at position 3, but we couldn't find a word, so maybe it's not likely? Or we missed a word.

Another word for case 1: ""BOREE"" not common.
""FORZE"" not word.

Perhaps ""QUREK"" not word.

So probably, the secret word is more likely to have R at position 5.

For the third guess, we can guess a word that has R at position 5 and E at position 4, and test other positions.

For example, ""POWER"": tests P at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.

If we guess this, and if R is indeed at position 5, we might get R(✓), and E(✓), and information about P,O,W.

If R is not at 5, then we will get R(-) for position 5, meaning R is present but not at 5, so it must be at position 3 (since positions 1 and 2 are ruled out).

But in that case, we would have to use a different word.

But with ""POWER"", we cover the case for R at 5 and also test three new letters.

Similarly, ""TOWER"" or ""MOWER"" are also good.

I think ""POWER"" is fine.

But let's see if we can include more common letters.

Available common letters: O, T, L, etc.

""LOWER"": L O W E R -> L at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.

""TOWER"": T O W E R.

All similar.

I'll go with ""POWER"".

But we have to make sure we don't use absent letters.

P, O, W, E, R: E and R are known, P,O,W not used before.

So guess ""POWER"".

But in the feedback, we might get:

- If R is at 5, then R(✓)
- E is at 4, so E(✓)
- Then P, O, W will be checked.

If R is not at 5, then R(-) meaning R is present but not at 5, so it must be at 3.

And then we know.

Also, if any of P,O,W are in the word, we get feedback.

So it's a good guess.

Therefore, third guess: POWER

Step-by-step:

- E is confirmed at position 4.
- R is present but not at position 1 or 2, so must be at 3 or 5.
- To test R at position 5 and introduce new common letters, guess ""POWER"" which places R at 5 and E at 4.
- This will either confirm R at position 5 or reveal that R must be at position 3 (if R is marked as present but wrong position at 5).
- Also tests P, O, W in positions 1, 2, and 3.

<guess>POWER</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **E is confirmed at position 4** (from Guess 2: E(✓)).
- **R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2** (from Guess 1: R(-) at position 2; Guess 2: R(-) at position 1). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 5.
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, I, D, S (marked ""x"" in feedback).
- **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the third guess, I need to:
- Test the position of R (position 3 or 5).
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.
- Keep E fixed at position 4.

A strong guess is **POWER**:
- **P, O, W** are new, common letters not yet tested.
- **E** is placed at position 4 (confirmed correct).
- **R** is placed at position 5 (testing if R is at position 5; if not, it must be at position 3).
- Avoids all absent letters (C, A, N, I, D, S).

This guess efficiently narrows down R's position while covering frequent English letters.",Guess 3: POWER -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) W(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We can choose a word that covers frequent letters.

 Let's consider the frequency of letters in 5-letter English words. The most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc.

 A popular starting word is ""ROATE"" (which means the cumulative return from investments) but it's not very common. 
 Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is a good one because it has two vowels (A, I) and three common consonants (R, S, E).

 But note: the feedback symbols are case-sensitive? The example used uppercase. However, the rules don't specify. 
 We'll assume the game is case-insensitive for the word, but we'll output in uppercase as in the example.

 Another good starting word is ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E — all common letters.

 I think I'll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 However, let me check if ""CRANE"" is a valid 5-letter word. Yes, it is.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".I am starting the game and need to make my first guess. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word with common letters to maximize information. The most frequent letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, and N. A strong starting word should include several of these. ""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because it contains C (common consonant), R (2nd most common consonant), A (common vowel), N (common consonant), and E (most common vowel). This combination covers frequent letters and positions, helping me gather useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Interpretation:
- C is not in the word at all.
- R is in the word but not in the second position (where we guessed it).
- A is not in the word at all.
- N is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

So, we know:
- The word contains R and E, but not in the positions we guessed.
- The word does NOT contain C, A, N.

Since R is in the word but not in position 2, and E is in the word but not in position 5, and our guess had R in position 2 and E in position 5, they must be elsewhere.

Now, we need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word without C, A, N, and including R and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively? Actually, the position constraints: 
- R cannot be in position 2 (because feedback was R(-), meaning it's present but wrong position).
- E cannot be in position 5.

Moreover, since the word has R and E, and no C, A, N, we can list possible letters.

We also note that the word might have other letters. Since A and C are out, we should avoid vowels that are less common? We have E, so we focus on common consonants and vowels.

Common remaining letters: E, R, and others like O, I, T, S, L, etc.

But we know R is in the word, so we must include R. Similarly, E must be included.

In the new guess, we should place R in a position that is not 2, and E in a position that is not 5. Also, avoid positions 1,3,4 for R and E? Wait, the feedback doesn't say anything about positions 1,3,4 being correct or not for R and E? Actually:

- For R: only position 2 is wrong, so it could be in position 1,3,4, or even 5? But position 5 might be taken by E? Actually, E cannot be in position 5 in the secret word, so E must be in positions 1-4.

Similarly, R must be in positions 1,3,4, or 5? But we don't know about position 5 for R. Since E is in the word and not in position 5, R could be in position 5? Yes.

So constraints:
- The word must include R and E.
- R not in position 2.
- E not in position 5.
- No C, A, N.

Now, our goal is to guess a word that respects these constraints and uses common letters to test other positions.

We should also try to get information about other letters. Since E is in the word, let's think about possible positions.

Possible positions for E: since not at 5, it must be at 1,2,3, or 4.
Similarly for R: not at 2, so at 1,3,4,5.

We should avoid placing E in position 5 (already forbidden) and R in position 2.

But in our new guess, we can put E and R in any positions we want, remembering the feedback rules.

What word to choose? Let's think of common words with R and E, and without C, A, N.

Also, the word should not reuse letters that are already known absent: C, A, N.

We have already used C, R, A, N, E. From this, we know E and R are present, so we should reuse E and R in the new guess? But note: in Wordle-like games, reusing letters that are present is good to find their positions.

So, we must include R and E in our new guess.

We need a word that contains R and E, not containing C, A, N.

Possible words: 
- Words like ""ROBES"", ""STORE"", ""GUIDE"" (but GUIDEs has D and U, and E at end? We know E not at end? No, E not at position 5, so in STORE E is at 5, which is forbidden? Yes, so avoid words ending with E.

In the secret word, E cannot be at position 5, but in our guess, we can put E at any position? Yes, because we are testing. However, if we put E at position 5, we expect it to be marked x or -, but we know in the secret word E is not at position 5, so if we put E at 5, it will be wrong position? Actually, feedback: if we put E at 5, and E is in the word elsewhere, it will show -. If E is not at 5, and we guess E at 5, it will be wrong position only if E is present? Yes.

But to avoid wasting the E test, we should put E in a position where it might be correct, i.e., positions 1-4.

Similarly for R, avoid position 2.

So, good choices: put R in position 1,3,4, or 5; and E in position 1,2,3, or 4.

Now, what about the other letters? We need new letters to test.

Possible candidates:

- Words beginning with R: e.g., ""RESTS"", but S in it. But we don't know anything about S. However, ""RESTS"" has E at position 2 and R at 1, which we can test.

But ""RESTS"" has T and S, common letters.

But also, we want to use letters not yet tried? Yes, to get more information.

Letters tried so far: C, R, A, N, E. So we haven't tried S, T, O, I, L, etc.

Good words: ""RISES"" has I and S. But A is forbidden? Yes, but no A. However, ""RISES"" has R at 1, I at 2, S at 3, E at 4, S at 5. Position: E at 4, and R at 1 (which is not position 2). Good. And no C,A,N.

But in the secret word, E is present but not at position 5? Here E is at 4.

Possibly.

Word ""ROLES"": R at 1, O at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5. E at 4 (which is allowed for secret word), R at 1 (not position 2). Good.

But we need to see which one is better.

Another word: ""TRIES"" - T, R, I, E, S. Positions: R at 2? But R cannot be at position 2 because the feedback for our first guess told us R is not in position 2. So if we put R at position 2, it will be wrong again? No, the secret word has R, but not at position 2. So in a new position, we must avoid putting R at position 2 because we know it's not there.

In ""TRIES"": T position 1, R position 2. But R at position 2 in the guess would trigger a ""-"" because R is present but not in position 2. But we are not learning new? We are confirming that position 2 is wrong for R. But since we already know that, it's redundant.

To maximize new information, we should place R in a position where it might be correct, i.e., positions 1,3,4,5.

For example, ""TRIES"" with R at position 2 is inefficient because it re-tests position 2.

Better to put R at a new position.

Similarly for E, avoid position 5? But E at position 5: we know in secret word E is not at 5, so if we guess E at 5, we'll just get a ""-"" which tells us E is elsewhere, but we already know E is present. So it wastes a chance to pinpoint E's position? Yes.

Therefore, best to put E in one of positions 1-4 to see if that position is correct.

Similarly for R, put in positions 1,3,4,5 (avoiding 2).

Now, let's list possible words.

Option 1: ""PORTS"" - has P,O,R,T,S. But E is required? We must include E because we know E is in the word. If we don't include E, and E is in the word, we may miss it? But the word must contain E? No, our guess doesn't have to include E if we are testing other letters? But we know E is in the secret word, so to get information about E's position, we should include it? Not necessarily, but including E helps us to find its position.

Including E and R in the guess is efficient because we can test new positions.

If we skip E or R, we might get less information.

So prioritise words with both E and R.

Words with R and E, no C,A,N, E not at end? Optional in guess, but as reasoned, better to avoid E at 5 for new guess.

Some options:

- ""SERVE"": S, E, R, V, E? Letters: E at pos1, R at pos3, and E at pos5? But E at 5: since we know E is not at 5 in secret word, if we guess E at 5, we'll get ""-"" meaning E is present but not at that position. But we have two E's? And in ""SERVE"", E is at position 1 and 5.

But the secret word might or might not have duplicates? But in our first guess, we had no duplicates, so we don't know if duplicates are possible.

But to avoid complications, guess words without duplicates for now.

Better single E.

Word ""ROGUE"": R at 1, O at 2, G at 3, U at 4, E at 5. But E at 5: if we guess E at 5, and secret word E not at 5, we'll get ""-"". Also, U is less common.

Word ""RIDES"": R at 1, I at 2, D at 3, E at 4, S at 5. E at position 4 (good, not 5), R at position 1 (good, not 2). Also, includes D and S, which are untested.

Similarly, ""TREES"": T, R, E, E, S? Duplicate E, and R at 2? Avoid R at 2.

""DRIVE"": D at 1, R at 2? Avoid R at 2.

""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E. Positions: R at position 2? Avoid position 2 for R.

How about ""SPIRE"": S, P, I, R, E? E at position 5? Avoid E at 5 if possible. Put E at position 5? We'll get ""-"", but we could.

But to conserve, better put E in 1-4.

So back to ""RIDES"": R at 1, I at 2, D at 3, E at 4, S at 5. 
- R position 1: If R is at position 1 for secret word, we get ✓, else ""-"".
- E position 4: similar.
- Also tests I,D,S.

Another option: ""ROPES"": R at 1, O at 2, P at 3, E at 4, S at 5. Similarly.

""ROPES"" has O and P, which are common.

""RIDES"": R, I, D, E, S.

We also have ""REUSE"": R at 1? But ""REUSE"" has two E's? Not ideal. ""REUSE"": R, E, U, S, E? E at position 2 and 5.

Avoid.

Better ""RIDES"" or ""ROPES"", or ""TILES""? But TILES has T,I,L,E,S but no R? We must include R? Not mandatory for guess, but to test R, better include.

We know R is present, so including it can confirm position.

Option: ""RETCH"" but C is out? We have C as absent, ""RETCH"" has C? No, C is invalid? ""RETCH"" has C? The word contains C? Yes, so avoid.

""RESTS"": R, E, S, T, S? But R at position 1, E at position 2, S at 3 and 5? And T at 4? Good positions? E at 2: since E is present but not necessarily at 2. But we don't have any constraint on E position except not 5? And R not at 2. In ""RESTS"", R at 1 (okay), E at 2 (could be), and avoids E at 5.

Also, includes S and T, common letters.

But duplicate S? Not a problem necessarily.

Compared to ""RIDES"": both have S at the end? ""RESTS"" ends with S, ""RIDES"" also ends with S.

But ""RESTS"" might be better because it also has T.

But E is at position 2 in ""RESTS"", while in ""RIDES"" E is at 4.

We don't know which positions E might be.

Now, deciding between ""RESTS"" and ""RIDES"".

Perhaps ""STREP"", but that ends with P? ""STREP"": S,T,R,E,P. E at 4? R at 3? Positions: position1=S,2=T,3=R,4=E,5=P? Then S,T,R,E,P.

R is at position 3 (which is not 2, allowed), E at position 4 (not 5, avoided).

And includes S,T,P.

Also, all unique letters? ""STREP"" has S,T,R,E,P — unique letters.

Good candidate.

But ""STREP"" means a type of bacteria? Might be obscure. Is ""strep"" a valid common word? Not ideal.

Perhaps ""STRIP"" but no E? Must have E? Not required, but E is in word? We should include E.

Then ""SERVE"" as I thought earlier: S, E, R, V, E? E at 1 and 5? Duplicate E.

Bad.

""VERSE"": V,E,R,S,E? Duplicate E.

""GRIPE"": G,R,I,P,E? E at 5? We avoid E at 5.

But if we guess E at 5, we get ""-"" meaning E present but elsewhere.

But to save a position test, better not.

""GRIME"": G,R,I,M,E? E at 5.

Same.

""BRIDE"": B,R,I,D,E? B might be good? But we have to avoid B? No, only C,A,N are out. B hasn't been tried.

Positions: R at 2? Avoid R at 2. In ""BRIDE"", R is at 2? So position 2 for R? Bad.

Avoid R at 2: so for words, R should be first, third, fourth, or last.

Perhaps ""OREAD"": O,R,E,A,D? A is out? A is not allowed? We know A is not in word? Feedback said A(x), so absent, thus OREAD has A? Position 4? So invalid guess because A is out.

Thus avoid words containing A,C, or N.

So words must consist of letters not C,A,N.

Letters available: B,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But with R and E included.

Another word: ""WISER"": W,I,S,E,R? Positions: R at last position? R at 5? Good. E at position 4? Okay. And W,I,S.

""RIPER"": R,I,P,E,R? Duplicate R? Avoid.

Perhaps ""DRIFT"": D,R,I,F,T? No E? Omit E.

Yes, we can omit E since we know E is present, and it might be tested in later guesses? But better to include now.

""WRIST"": W,R,I,S,T? No E.

But E is known present, so guess should include E to find position.

Therefore, going back, ""RIDES"" seems good: R in position 1, E in position 4, and I,D,S are new.

""RIDES"" is a word? Yes, like horse rides.

Similarly, ""ROPES"" is also common.

""ROPES"" has O, which is vowel.

But both options are fine.

I think I choose ""RIDES"" for its commonality.

But ""RESTS"" might be more common? ""RESTS"" has duplicate S? But that's okay.

Another good one: ""STORE"" but E at 5? Avoid if possible.

How about ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E? But E at 5. No, E at 5 not desired. And no R? Omit R.

Must include R? Not enforced, but we know R is present so exclude?

If we guess without R, we might get feedback that misses the R position? But we can infer.

For example, if we guess ""STOLE"", we might:
- Get S, T, O, L, E feedback.
But E at 5, we know E is present but not at 5, so we'll get E(-).
But we also know R is present, but not in the guess, so the feedback won't tell us anything about R. Meaning, we won't test new positions for R.

To be efficient, better reuse known present letters R and E in new positions.

Therefore, I decide to use ""RIDES"": R in position 1, I in position 2, D in position 3, E in position 4, S in position 5.

So, guess: RIDES

Step-by-step reasoning: Since R is present but not at position 2, I place R at position 1 to test if it's there. E is present not at position 5, so I place at position 4. The word includes new letters I, D, S to gather more information.Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- **C, A, N** are **not in the word**.
- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2**.
- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the second guess, I need to include both **R and E** (since they exist in the word) but avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5. I also cannot use **C, A, or N**. Ideally, the new guess should test new positions for R and E and introduce common unused letters to gather more information.

A strong candidate is **RIDES**:
- **R** is placed in **position 1** (a possible correct position; previously not tested).
- **E** is placed in **position 4** (avoiding position 5 and testing a new potential spot).
- **I, D, S** are new letters (common consonants/vowels not yet tested).
- Avoids all forbidden letters (no C, A, N) and aligns with constraints.

This should help narrow down the position of R and E while covering frequent English letters.

<guess>RIDES</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: RIDES -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: CRANE
- C: absent (x)
- R: present but wrong position (-) [since it was in position 2, but not there]
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-) [position 5 is wrong]

Second guess: RIDES
- R: present but wrong position (-) [we placed R at position 1, but it's not there]
- I: absent (x)
- D: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) [we placed E at position 4, and it is correct!]
- S: absent (x)

So, what do we know?
1. The secret word has the letter E in position 4. (Great! So E is fixed at the 4th position.)
2. The letter R is in the word, but it is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 1 (from second guess). So R must be in position 3 or 5? (Positions: 1,2,3,4,5; but position 4 is E, so R can be in 3 or 5.)
3. The following letters are absent: C, A, N, I, D, S. (So we cannot use these letters.)

Also, from the first guess, we know E is present and not at position 5, which is consistent because now we know E is at 4.

Now, the secret word has E at position 4, and R is present but not at 1 or 2. So R must be at position 3 or 5.

Additionally, we have no information about other letters. We have used: C, R, A, N, E, I, D, S. So absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need to form a 5-letter word that has E at position 4 and R at either position 3 or 5.

Also, the word must include R (since it's present) and we know E is at 4.

Now, for the third guess, we should try to determine the position of R and also test other letters.

We have two cases for R: position 3 or 5.

We can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we can only test one word.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R in position 3 and then see, or in position 5.

But we also want to test other common letters.

Since E is fixed at 4, the word pattern is: _ _ _ E _

And R must be in the third or fifth position.

So possible patterns: 
- If R is at 3: _ _ R E _
- If R is at 5: _ _ _ E R

We need to fill the other positions with new letters.

We should avoid the absent letters: C,A,N,I,D,S.

Let's think of words that fit these patterns.

First, pattern: _ _ R E _

Possible words: 
- With R at 3: e.g., ""CARE"" but C and A are out. Not possible.
- ""BARE"" but A is out.
- ""FIRE"" but I is out? I is absent? Yes, I is absent. So no.
- ""MORE"": M, O, R, E, ? -> but E is at 4, so ""MORE"" would be M O R E, but we need 5 letters? ""MORE"" is 4 letters. We need 5-letter words.

5-letter words with pattern _ _ R E _

Examples:
- ""STORE"" but S and T? S is absent, T is available? S is absent, so no.
- ""CHORE"" but C and H? C is absent, so no.
- ""WHORE"" but W,H,O,R,E? But O is available, but we have E at 4, so ""WHORE"" is W H O R E -> positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:O? No, we need R at position 3. ""WHORE"" has R at 4? W H O R E -> 1:W, 2:H, 3:O, 4:R, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, so position 4 must be E, but here it's R? Not matching.

We need the fourth letter to be E, so for pattern _ _ R E _, it means:
Position 1: ?
Position 2: ?
Position 3: R
Position 4: E
Position 5: ?

Similarly, for pattern _ _ _ E R: 
Position 1: ?
Position 2: ?
Position 3: ?
Position 4: E
Position 5: R

Now, let's find words for pattern 1: _ _ R E _

With available letters: no C,A,N,I,D,S.

Possible words:
- ""PARER"" but P,A,R,E,R? A is absent, and duplicate R? Also, E at 4? ""PARER"": P A R E R -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:R, 4:E, 5:R -> but A is absent, so invalid.
- ""MOVER"": M O V E R? But E is at 4? ""MOVER"": M O V E R -> 1:M, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R -> this is pattern _ _ _ E R, not _ _ R E _.

For pattern _ _ R E _:
- ""BORED"": B O R E D -> but D is absent? D is absent, so no.
- ""FOREX""? Not common word.
- ""GORED"": G O R E D -> D absent.
- ""HORDE"": H O R D E -> D absent, and E at 5? ""HORDE"" is H O R D E -> 1:H,2:O,3:R,4:D,5:E -> but we need E at 4, so position 4 is D? Not E. So no.

It seems hard to find a word for _ _ R E _ with the constraints.

Perhaps ""MURRE"" or ""PURGE""? 
- ""PURGE"": P U R G E -> 1:P, 2:U, 3:R, 4:G, 5:E -> position 4 is G, not E. So no.

We need position 4 to be E, so for pattern _ _ R E _, it must have E at position 4? No: the pattern is _ _ R E _, meaning:
Position 1: letter
Position 2: letter
Position 3: R
Position 4: E
Position 5: letter

But in ""PURGE"", position 4 is G, not E.

So we need a word where position 4 is E and position 3 is R? But we are considering the case where R is at position 3.

But in the word, position 4 is fixed as E, so if R is at 3, then we have ... R E ...

But let's list words ending with ""RE"" but that's position 4 and 5? No.

Perhaps it's easier to think of words that have E at position 4.

So the word must be: ? ? ? E ?

And R must be at 3 or 5.

Case 1: R at position 3: then word is ? ? R E ?
Case 2: R at position 5: then word is ? ? ? E R

Now, for case 1: ? ? R E ?

With available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding C,A,N,I,D,S)

Possible words:
- ""BORED"" -> B O R E D -> but D is absent, invalid.
- ""FIRED"" -> F I R E D -> I and D absent.
- ""HORDE"" -> H O R D E -> D absent, and E at 5? No, position 4 is D? H O R D E: pos4=D, pos5=E -> not E at 4.
- ""LURED"" -> L U R E D -> D absent.
- ""MURKY"" -> M U R K Y -> no E at 4? Position 4 is K, not E.
- ""PUREE"" -> P U R E E -> but E at 4 and 5? ""PUREE"": P U R E E -> pos1:P,2:U,3:R,4:E,5:E -> this fits: ? ? R E ? with ? at 1,2,5 being P,U,E? But E at 5 is duplicate? And E is at 4 and 5.

But the secret word has E at position 4, but it might have another E? We don't know. But in our first guess, we had E and it was not at 5, but now we know E is at 4, so position 5 could be E? But the feedback for first guess E(-) at position 5 means that E is not at 5, so the secret word does not have E at position 5. Therefore, position 5 cannot be E. So ""PUREE"" has E at 5, which would be invalid for secret word? But we are guessing, so we can guess it, but it would be inconsistent with what we know? No, we can guess it, but we know that if we guess E at 5, it will be marked absent (since E is not at 5) or if the word has duplicate E? But we don't know if duplicate E is possible.

But from first guess, E was not at 5, but it could be at 4 and also at 5? No, because if E were at 5, the first guess would have shown E as correct or wrong position? In first guess, we had E at position 5, and it was marked (-) meaning present but wrong position. That means E is in the word but not at position 5. So if E were also at position 4, it would still be marked present but not at 5. But the feedback doesn't tell us about position 4. So it's possible that E is at 4 and not at 5, and no duplicate.

But in ""PUREE"", we have E at 4 and 5, but we know E is not at 5, so for secret word, position 5 cannot be E. Therefore, ""PUREE"" as a guess is okay, but it has E at 5 which we know is wrong, so it will be marked as present but wrong position? But E is already at 4, which is correct, so position 5 E would be marked as absent? Let's think about feedback rules.

If the secret word has only one E, and we guess two E's, then:
- If we guess E at position 4 and it is correct, it gets ✓.
- If we guess E at position 5 and the secret word has no E at 5, it should be marked x (absent) if there is no second E? But the feedback for duplicate letters: typically in Wordle, if the letter appears once, and you guess it twice, the second one might be marked x if not present.

Standard Wordle rules: for duplicate letters, if the secret has one E, and you guess two E's, the first one in correct position gets ✓, and the second one in wrong position gets x (because there's no extra E). Or if the first one is in wrong position, it gets -, and the second one might get x.

But in this case, for ""PUREE"" as a guess:
- Position 4: E is correct, so ✓.
- Position 5: E is not in the secret word (since only one E at position 4), so it should be x.

But we are trying to guess, so it's acceptable, but it wastes a letter.

To avoid confusion, better to avoid duplicate letters in guess.

So back to finding words.

For case 1: ? ? R E ? with no C,A,N,I,D,S and no duplicate.

Possible words: 
- ""FOREMAN"" too long.
- 5-letter: ""FOREM"" not a word.
- ""GORED"" invalid.
- ""HOVER"" H O V E R -> but this is ? ? ? E R, not ? ? R E ?.

""BORNE"" but B O R N E -> N is absent.

""PURGE"" P U R G E -> positions: 1:P,2:U,3:R,4:G,5:E -> but position 4 is G, not E. We need position 4 to be E, so this has E at 5.

I think I'm confusing the pattern.

For case 1, we want R at position 3 and E at position 4, so the word must have letter3=R and letter4=E.

So words like X X R E X.

Examples:
- ""BREAD"" but B R E A D -> position 3 is E, not R? ""BREAD"": B at1, R at2, E at3, A at4, D at5 -> not matching.
- ""TREND"" T R E N D -> position 3 is E, not R.
- ""CREST"" C R E S T -> C and S absent, and position 3 is E.

We need position 3=R and position 4=E.

""FREED"" F R E E D -> duplicate E, and D absent.
""GREET"" G R E E T -> duplicate E.
""PREXY"" not a word.
""TREYF"" not a word.

It's difficult. Perhaps there are no common words with R at 3 and E at 4 with the available letters.

Let's try case 2: R at position 5, so pattern ? ? ? E R

Then the word is letter1, letter2, letter3, E, R.

With available letters.

Examples:
- ""LATER"" but A is absent.
- ""METER"" M E T E R -> duplicate E, and position 4 is E? ""METER"": M at1, E at2, T at3, E at4, R at5 -> but we need position 4 to be E, which it is, and position 5=R. But it has E at2 and E at4, so duplicate E. Also, E at2 is new? But we know E is at4, so E at2 might be absent or wrong position.

But duplicate.

""POWER"" P O W E R -> positions: P at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5 -> perfect! No duplicate, and letters P,O,W are available.

""POWER"" is a valid word.

Other options:
- ""TOWER"" T O W E R -> similar, T available.
- ""MOWER"" M O W E R -> M available.
- ""COVER"" but C absent.
- ""HOVER"" H O V E R -> H and V available.
- ""LOVER"" L O V E R -> L and V.

All good.

Now, we also have the possibility that R is at position 3, but we couldn't find a word, so maybe it's not likely? Or we missed a word.

Another word for case 1: ""BOREE"" not common.
""FORZE"" not word.

Perhaps ""QUREK"" not word.

So probably, the secret word is more likely to have R at position 5.

For the third guess, we can guess a word that has R at position 5 and E at position 4, and test other positions.

For example, ""POWER"": tests P at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.

If we guess this, and if R is indeed at position 5, we might get R(✓), and E(✓), and information about P,O,W.

If R is not at 5, then we will get R(-) for position 5, meaning R is present but not at 5, so it must be at position 3 (since positions 1 and 2 are ruled out).

But in that case, we would have to use a different word.

But with ""POWER"", we cover the case for R at 5 and also test three new letters.

Similarly, ""TOWER"" or ""MOWER"" are also good.

I think ""POWER"" is fine.

But let's see if we can include more common letters.

Available common letters: O, T, L, etc.

""LOWER"": L O W E R -> L at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.

""TOWER"": T O W E R.

All similar.

I'll go with ""POWER"".

But we have to make sure we don't use absent letters.

P, O, W, E, R: E and R are known, P,O,W not used before.

So guess ""POWER"".

But in the feedback, we might get:

- If R is at 5, then R(✓)
- E is at 4, so E(✓)
- Then P, O, W will be checked.

If R is not at 5, then R(-) meaning R is present but not at 5, so it must be at 3.

And then we know.

Also, if any of P,O,W are in the word, we get feedback.

So it's a good guess.

Therefore, third guess: POWER

Step-by-step:

- E is confirmed at position 4.
- R is present but not at position 1 or 2, so must be at 3 or 5.
- To test R at position 5 and introduce new common letters, guess ""POWER"" which places R at 5 and E at 4.
- This will either confirm R at position 5 or reveal that R must be at position 3 (if R is marked as present but wrong position at 5).
- Also tests P, O, W in positions 1, 2, and 3.

<guess>POWER</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **E is confirmed at position 4** (from Guess 2: E(✓)).
- **R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2** (from Guess 1: R(-) at position 2; Guess 2: R(-) at position 1). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 5.
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, I, D, S (marked ""x"" in feedback).
- **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the third guess, I need to:
- Test the position of R (position 3 or 5).
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.
- Keep E fixed at position 4.

A strong guess is **POWER**:
- **P, O, W** are new, common letters not yet tested.
- **E** is placed at position 4 (confirmed correct).
- **R** is placed at position 5 (testing if R is at position 5; if not, it must be at position 3).
- Avoids all absent letters (C, A, N, I, D, S).

This guess efficiently narrows down R's position while covering frequent English letters.

Actually, the position constraints: \n- R cannot be in position 2 (because feedback was R(-), meaning it\'s present but wrong position).\n- E cannot be in position 5.\n\nMoreover, since the word has R and E, and no C, A, N, we can list possible letters.\n\nWe also note that the word might have other letters.

Similarly, E must be included.\n\nIn the new guess, we should place R in a position that is not 2, and E in a position that is not 5. Also, avoid positions 1,3,4 for R and E? Wait, the feedback doesn\'t say anything about positions 1,3,4 being correct or not for R and E? Actually:\n\n- For R: only position 2 is wrong, so it could be in position 1,3,4, or even 5? But position 5 might be taken by E? Actually, E cannot be in position 5 in the secret word, so E must be in positions 1-4.\n\nSimilarly, R must be in positions 1,3,4, or 5? But we don\'t know about position 5 for R. Since E is in the word and not in position 5, R could be in position 5? Yes.\n\nSo constraints:\n- The word must include R and E.\n- R not in position 2.\n- E not in position 5.\n- No C, A, N.\n\nNow, our goal is to guess a word that respects these constraints and uses common letters to test other positions.\n\nWe should also try to get information about other letters. Since E is in the word, let\'s think about possible positions.\n\nPossible positions for E: since not at 5, it must be at 1,2,3, or 4.\nSimilarly for R: not at 2, so at 1,3,4,5.\n\nWe should avoid placing E in position 5 (already forbidden) and R in position 2.\n\nBut in our new guess, we can put E and R in any positions we want, remembering the feedback rules.\n\nWhat word to choose? Let\'s think of common words with R and E, and without C, A, N.\n\nAlso, the word should not reuse letters that are already known absent: C, A, N.\n\nWe have already used C, R, A, N, E. From this, we know E and R are present, so we should reuse E and R in the new guess? But note: in Wordle-like games, reusing letters that are present is good to find their positions.\n\nSo, we must include R and E in our new guess.\n\nWe need a word that contains R and E, not containing C, A, N.\n\nPossible words: \n- Words like ""ROBES"", ""STORE"", ""GUIDE"" (but GUIDEs has D and U, and E at end? We know E not at end? No, E not at position 5, so in STORE E is at 5, which is forbidden? Yes, so avoid words ending with E.\n\nIn the secret word, E cannot be at position 5, but in our guess, we can put E at any position? Yes, because we are testing. However, if we put E at position 5, we expect it to be marked x or -, but we know in the secret word E is not at position 5, so if we put E at 5, it will be wrong position? Actually, feedback: if we put E at 5, and E is in the word elsewhere, it will show -. If E is not at 5, and we guess E at 5, it will be wrong position only if E is present? Yes.\n\nBut to avoid wasting the E test, we should put E in a position where it might be correct, i.e., positions 1-4.\n\nSimilarly for R, avoid position 2.\n\nSo, good choices: put R in position 1,3,4, or 5; and E in position 1,2,3, or 4.\n\nNow, what about the other letters? We need new letters to test.\n\nPossible candidates:\n\n- Words beginning with R: e.g., ""RESTS"", but S in it. But we don\'t know anything about S. However, ""RESTS"" has E at position 2 and R at 1, which we can test.\n\nBut ""RESTS"" has T and S, common letters.\n\nBut also, we want to use letters not yet tried? Yes, to get more information.\n\nLetters tried so far: C, R, A, N, E. So we haven\'t tried S, T, O, I, L, etc.\n\nGood words: ""RISES"" has I and S. But A is forbidden? Yes, but no A. However, ""RISES"" has R at 1, I at 2, S at 3, E at 4, S at 5. Position: E at 4, and R at 1 (which is not position 2). Good. And no C,A,N.\n\nBut in the secret word, E is present but not at position 5? Here E is at 4.\n\nPossibly.\n\nWord ""ROLES"": R at 1, O at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5. E at 4 (which is allowed for secret word), R at 1 (not position 2). Good.\n\nBut we need to see which one is better.\n\nAnother word: ""TRIES"" - T, R, I, E, S. Positions: R at 2? But R cannot be at position 2 because the feedback for our first guess told us R is not in position 2. So if we put R at position 2, it will be wrong again? No, the secret word has R, but not at position 2. So in a new position, we must avoid putting R at position 2 because we know it\'s not there.\n\nIn ""TRIES"": T position 1, R position 2. But R at position 2 in the guess would trigger a ""-"" because R is present but not in position 2. But we are not learning new? We are confirming that position 2 is wrong for R. But since we already know that, it\'s redundant.\n\nTo maximize new information, we should place R in a position where it might be correct, i.e., positions 1,3,4,5.\n\nFor example, ""TRIES"" with R at position 2 is inefficient because it re-tests position 2.\n\nBetter to put R at a new position.\n\nSimilarly for E, avoid position 5? But E at position 5: we know in secret word E is not at 5, so if we guess E at 5, we\'ll just get a ""-"" which tells us E is elsewhere, but we already know E is present. So it wastes a chance to pinpoint E\'s position? Yes.\n\nTherefore, best to put E in one of positions 1-4 to see if that position is correct.\n\nSimilarly for R, put in positions 1,3,4,5 (avoiding 2).\n\nNow, let\'s list possible words.\n\nOption 1: ""PORTS"" - has P,O,R,T,S. But E is required? We must include E because we know E is in the word. If we don\'t include E, and E is in the word, we may miss it? But the word must contain E? No, our guess doesn\'t have to include E if we are testing other letters? But we know E is in the secret word, so to get information about E\'s position, we should include it? Not necessarily, but including E helps us to find its position.\n\nIncluding E and R in the guess is efficient because we can test new positions.\n\nIf we skip E or R, we might get less information.\n\nSo prioritise words with both E and R.\n\nWords with R and E, no C,A,N, E not at end? Optional in guess, but as reasoned, better to avoid E at 5 for new guess.\n\nSome options:\n\n- ""SERVE"": S, E, R, V, E? Letters: E at pos1, R at pos3, and E at pos5? But E at 5: since we know E is not at 5 in secret word, if we guess E at 5, we\'ll get ""-"" meaning E is present but not at that position. But we have two E\'s? And in ""SERVE"", E is at position 1 and 5.\n\nBut the secret word might or might not have duplicates? But in our first guess, we had no duplicates, so we don\'t know if duplicates are possible.\n\nBut to avoid complications, guess words without duplicates for now.\n\nBetter single E.\n\nWord ""ROGUE"": R at 1, O at 2, G at 3, U at 4, E at 5. But E at 5: if we guess E at 5, and secret word E not at 5, we\'ll get ""-"". Also, U is less common.\n\nWord ""RIDES"": R at 1, I at 2, D at 3, E at 4, S at 5. E at position 4 (good, not 5), R at position 1 (good, not 2). Also, includes D and S, which are untested.\n\nSimilarly, ""TREES"": T, R, E, E, S? Duplicate E, and R at 2? Avoid R at 2.\n\n""DRIVE"": D at 1, R at 2? Avoid R at 2.\n\n""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E. Positions: R at position 2? Avoid position 2 for R.\n\nHow about ""SPIRE"": S, P, I, R, E? E at position 5? Avoid E at 5 if possible. Put E at position 5? We\'ll get ""-"", but we could.\n\nBut to conserve, better put E in 1-4.\n\nSo back to ""RIDES"": R at 1, I at 2, D at 3, E at 4, S at 5. \n- R position 1: If R is at position 1 for secret word, we get ✓, else ""-"".\n- E position 4: similar.\n- Also tests I,D,S.\n\nAnother option: ""ROPES"": R at 1, O at 2, P at 3, E at 4, S at 5. Similarly.\n\n""ROPES"" has O and P, which are common.\n\n""RIDES"": R, I, D, E, S.\n\nWe also have ""REUSE"": R at 1? But ""REUSE"" has two E\'s? Not ideal. ""REUSE"": R, E, U, S, E? E at position 2 and 5.\n\nAvoid.\n\nBetter ""RIDES"" or ""ROPES"", or ""TILES""? But TILES has T,I,L,E,S but no R? We must include R? Not mandatory for guess, but to test R, better include.\n\nWe know R is present, so including it can confirm position.\n\nOption: ""RETCH"" but C is out? We have C as absent, ""RETCH"" has C? No, C is invalid? ""RETCH"" has C? The word contains C? Yes, so avoid.\n\n""RESTS"": R, E, S, T, S? But R at position 1, E at position 2, S at 3 and 5? And T at 4? Good positions? E at 2: since E is present but not necessarily at 2. But we don\'t have any constraint on E position except not 5? And R not at 2. In ""RESTS"", R at 1 (okay), E at 2 (could be), and avoids E at 5.\n\nAlso, includes S and T, common letters.\n\nBut duplicate S? Not a problem necessarily.\n\nCompared to ""RIDES"": both have S at the end? ""RESTS"" ends with S, ""RIDES"" also ends with S.\n\nBut ""RESTS"" might be better because it also has T.\n\nBut E is at position 2 in ""RESTS"", while in ""RIDES"" E is at 4.\n\nWe don\'t know which positions E might be.\n\nNow, deciding between ""RESTS"" and ""RIDES"".\n\nPerhaps ""STREP"", but that ends with P? ""STREP"": S,T,R,E,P. E at 4? R at 3? Positions: position1=S,2=T,3=R,4=E,5=P? Then S,T,R,E,P.\n\nR is at position 3 (which is not 2, allowed), E at position 4 (not 5, avoided).\n\nAnd includes S,T,P.\n\nAlso, all unique letters? ""STREP"" has S,T,R,E,P — unique letters.\n\nGood candidate.\n\nBut ""STREP"" means a type of bacteria? Might be obscure. Is ""strep"" a valid common word? Not ideal.\n\nPerhaps ""STRIP"" but no E? Must have E? Not required, but E is in word? We should include E.\n\nThen ""SERVE"" as I thought earlier: S, E, R, V, E? E at 1 and 5? Duplicate E.\n\nBad.\n\n""VERSE"": V,E,R,S,E? Duplicate E.\n\n""GRIPE"": G,R,I,P,E? E at 5? We avoid E at 5.\n\nBut if we guess E at 5, we get ""-"" meaning E present but elsewhere.\n\nBut to save a position test, better not.\n\n""GRIME"": G,R,I,M,E? E at 5.\n\nSame.\n\n""BRIDE"": B,R,I,D,E? B might be good? But we have to avoid B? No, only C,A,N are out. B hasn\'t been tried.\n\nPositions: R at 2? Avoid R at 2. In ""BRIDE"", R is at 2? So position 2 for R? Bad.\n\nAvoid R at 2: so for words, R should be first, third, fourth, or last.\n\nPerhaps ""OREAD"": O,R,E,A,D? A is out? A is not allowed? We know A is not in word? Feedback said A(x), so absent, thus OREAD has A? Position 4? So invalid guess because A is out.\n\nThus avoid words containing A,C, or N.\n\nSo words must consist of letters not C,A,N.\n\nLetters available: B,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nBut with R and E included.\n\nAnother word: ""WISER"": W,I,S,E,R? Positions: R at last position? R at 5? Good. E at position 4? Okay. And W,I,S.\n\n""RIPER"": R,I,P,E,R? Duplicate R? Avoid.\n\nPerhaps ""DRIFT"": D,R,I,F,T? No E? Omit E.\n\nYes, we can omit E since we know E is present, and it might be tested in later guesses? But better to include now.\n\n""WRIST"": W,R,I,S,T? No E.\n\nBut E is known present, so guess should include E to find position.\n\nTherefore, going back, ""RIDES"" seems good: R in position 1, E in position 4, and I,D,S are new.\n\n""RIDES"" is a word? Yes, like horse rides.\n\nSimilarly, ""ROPES"" is also common.\n\n""ROPES"" has O, which is vowel.\n\nBut both options are fine.\n\nI think I choose ""RIDES"" for its commonality.\n\nBut ""RESTS"" might be more common? ""RESTS"" has duplicate S? But that\'s okay.\n\nAnother good one: ""STORE"" but E at 5? Avoid if possible.\n\nHow about ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E? But E at 5. No, E at 5 not desired. And no R? Omit R.\n\nMust include R? Not enforced, but we know R is present so exclude?\n\nIf we guess without R, we might get feedback that misses the R position? But we can infer.\n\nFor example, if we guess ""STOLE"", we might:\n- Get S, T, O, L, E feedback.\nBut E at 5, we know E is present but not at 5, so we\'ll get E(-).\nBut we also know R is present, but not in the guess, so the feedback won\'t tell us anything about R. Meaning, we won\'t test new positions for R.\n\nTo be efficient, better reuse known present letters R and E in new positions.\n\nTherefore, I decide to use ""RIDES"": R in position 1, I in position 2, D in position 3, E in position 4, S in position 5.\n\nSo, guess: RIDES\n\nStep-by-step reasoning: Since R is present but not at position 2, I place R at position 1 to test if it\'s there. E is present not at position 5, so I place at position 4. The word includes new letters I, D, S to gather more information.Based on the feedback from the first guess:\n- **C, A, N** are **not in the word**.\n- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2**.\n- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5**.\n\nFor the second guess, I need to include both **R and E** (since they exist in the word) but avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5. I also cannot use **C, A, or N**. Ideally, the new guess should test new positions for R and E and introduce common unused letters to gather more information.\n\nA strong candidate is **RIDES**:\n- **R** is placed in **position 1** (a possible correct position; previously not tested).\n- **E** is placed in **position 4** (avoiding position 5 and testing a new potential spot).\n- **I, D, S** are new letters (common consonants/vowels not yet tested).\n- Avoids all forbidden letters (no C, A, N) and aligns with constraints.\n\nThis should help narrow down the position of R and E while covering frequent English letters.\n\n<guess>RIDES</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: RIDES -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: CRANE\n- C: absent (x)\n- R: present but wrong position (-) [since it was in position 2, but not there]\n- A: absent (x)\n- N: absent (x)\n- E: present but wrong position (-) [position 5 is wrong]\n\nSecond guess: RIDES\n- R: present but wrong position (-) [we placed R at position 1, but it\'s not there]\n- I: absent (x)\n- D: absent (x)\n- E: correct position (✓) [we placed E at position 4, and it is correct!]\n- S: absent (x)\n\nSo, what do we know?\n1. The secret word has the letter E in position 4. (Great! So E is fixed at the 4th position.)\n2. The letter R is in the word, but it is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 1 (from second guess). So R must be in position 3 or 5? (Positions: 1,2,3,4,5; but position 4 is E, so R can be in 3 or 5.)\n3. The following letters are absent: C, A, N, I, D, S. (So we cannot use these letters.)\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we know E is present and not at position 5, which is consistent because now we know E is at 4.\n\nNow, the secret word has E at position 4, and R is present but not at 1 or 2. So R must be at position 3 or 5.\n\nAdditionally, we have no information about other letters. We have used: C, R, A, N, E, I, D, S. So absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S.\n\nAvailable letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we need to form a 5-letter word that has E at position 4 and R at either position 3 or 5.\n\nAlso, the word must include R (since it\'s present) and we know E is at 4.\n\nNow, for the third guess, we should try to determine the position of R and also test other letters.\n\nWe have two cases for R: position 3 or 5.\n\nWe can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we can only test one word.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has R in position 3 and then see, or in position 5.\n\nBut we also want to test other common letters.\n\nSince E is fixed at 4, the word pattern is: _ _ _ E _\n\nAnd R must be in the third or fifth position.\n\nSo possible patterns: \n- If R is at 3: _ _ R E _\n- If R is at 5: _ _ _ E R\n\nWe need to fill the other positions with new letters.\n\nWe should avoid the absent letters: C,A,N,I,D,S.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit these patterns.\n\nFirst, pattern: _ _ R E _\n\nPossible words: \n- With R at 3: e.g., ""CARE"" but C and A are out. Not possible.\n- ""BARE"" but A is out.\n- ""FIRE"" but I is out? I is absent? Yes, I is absent. So no.\n- ""MORE"": M, O, R, E, ? -> but E is at 4, so ""MORE"" would be M O R E, but we need 5 letters? ""MORE"" is 4 letters. We need 5-letter words.\n\n5-letter words with pattern _ _ R E _\n\nExamples:\n- ""STORE"" but S and T? S is absent, T is available? S is absent, so no.\n- ""CHORE"" but C and H? C is absent, so no.\n- ""WHORE"" but W,H,O,R,E? But O is available, but we have E at 4, so ""WHORE"" is W H O R E -> positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:O? No, we need R at position 3. ""WHORE"" has R at 4? W H O R E -> 1:W, 2:H, 3:O, 4:R, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, so position 4 must be E, but here it\'s R? Not matching.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be E, so for pattern _ _ R E _, it means:\nPosition 1: ?\nPosition 2: ?\nPosition 3: R\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: ?\n\nSimilarly, for pattern _ _ _ E R: \nPosition 1: ?\nPosition 2: ?\nPosition 3: ?\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: R\n\nNow, let\'s find words for pattern 1: _ _ R E _\n\nWith available letters: no C,A,N,I,D,S.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""PARER"" but P,A,R,E,R? A is absent, and duplicate R? Also, E at 4? ""PARER"": P A R E R -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:R, 4:E, 5:R -> but A is absent, so invalid.\n- ""MOVER"": M O V E R? But E is at 4? ""MOVER"": M O V E R -> 1:M, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R -> this is pattern _ _ _ E R, not _ _ R E _.\n\nFor pattern _ _ R E _:\n- ""BORED"": B O R E D -> but D is absent? D is absent, so no.\n- ""FOREX""? Not common word.\n- ""GORED"": G O R E D -> D absent.\n- ""HORDE"": H O R D E -> D absent, and E at 5? ""HORDE"" is H O R D E -> 1:H,2:O,3:R,4:D,5:E -> but we need E at 4, so position 4 is D? Not E. So no.\n\nIt seems hard to find a word for _ _ R E _ with the constraints.\n\nPerhaps ""MURRE"" or ""PURGE""? \n- ""PURGE"": P U R G E -> 1:P, 2:U, 3:R, 4:G, 5:E -> position 4 is G, not E. So no.\n\nWe need position 4 to be E, so for pattern _ _ R E _, it must have E at position 4? No: the pattern is _ _ R E _, meaning:\nPosition 1: letter\nPosition 2: letter\nPosition 3: R\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: letter\n\nBut in ""PURGE"", position 4 is G, not E.\n\nSo we need a word where position 4 is E and position 3 is R? But we are considering the case where R is at position 3.\n\nBut in the word, position 4 is fixed as E, so if R is at 3, then we have ... R E ...\n\nBut let\'s list words ending with ""RE"" but that\'s position 4 and 5? No.\n\nPerhaps it\'s easier to think of words that have E at position 4.\n\nSo the word must be: ? ? ? E ?\n\nAnd R must be at 3 or 5.\n\nCase 1: R at position 3: then word is ? ? R E ?\nCase 2: R at position 5: then word is ? ? ? E R\n\nNow, for case 1: ? ? R E ?\n\nWith available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding C,A,N,I,D,S)\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BORED"" -> B O R E D -> but D is absent, invalid.\n- ""FIRED"" -> F I R E D -> I and D absent.\n- ""HORDE"" -> H O R D E -> D absent, and E at 5? No, position 4 is D? H O R D E: pos4=D, pos5=E -> not E at 4.\n- ""LURED"" -> L U R E D -> D absent.\n- ""MURKY"" -> M U R K Y -> no E at 4? Position 4 is K, not E.\n- ""PUREE"" -> P U R E E -> but E at 4 and 5? ""PUREE"": P U R E E -> pos1:P,2:U,3:R,4:E,5:E -> this fits: ? ? R E ? with ? at 1,2,5 being P,U,E? But E at 5 is duplicate? And E is at 4 and 5.\n\nBut the secret word has E at position 4, but it might have another E? We don\'t know. But in our first guess, we had E and it was not at 5, but now we know E is at 4, so position 5 could be E? But the feedback for first guess E(-) at position 5 means that E is not at 5, so the secret word does not have E at position 5. Therefore, position 5 cannot be E. So ""PUREE"" has E at 5, which would be invalid for secret word? But we are guessing, so we can guess it, but it would be inconsistent with what we know? No, we can guess it, but we know that if we guess E at 5, it will be marked absent (since E is not at 5) or if the word has duplicate E? But we don\'t know if duplicate E is possible.\n\nBut from first guess, E was not at 5, but it could be at 4 and also at 5? No, because if E were at 5, the first guess would have shown E as correct or wrong position? In first guess, we had E at position 5, and it was marked (-) meaning present but wrong position. That means E is in the word but not at position 5. So if E were also at position 4, it would still be marked present but not at 5. But the feedback doesn\'t tell us about position 4. So it\'s possible that E is at 4 and not at 5, and no duplicate.\n\nBut in ""PUREE"", we have E at 4 and 5, but we know E is not at 5, so for secret word, position 5 cannot be E. Therefore, ""PUREE"" as a guess is okay, but it has E at 5 which we know is wrong, so it will be marked as present but wrong position? But E is already at 4, which is correct, so position 5 E would be marked as absent? Let\'s think about feedback rules.\n\nIf the secret word has only one E, and we guess two E\'s, then:\n- If we guess E at position 4 and it is correct, it gets ✓.\n- If we guess E at position 5 and the secret word has no E at 5, it should be marked x (absent) if there is no second E? But the feedback for duplicate letters: typically in Wordle, if the letter appears once, and you guess it twice, the second one might be marked x if not present.\n\nStandard Wordle rules: for duplicate letters, if the secret has one E, and you guess two E\'s, the first one in correct position gets ✓, and the second one in wrong position gets x (because there\'s no extra E). Or if the first one is in wrong position, it gets -, and the second one might get x.\n\nBut in this case, for ""PUREE"" as a guess:\n- Position 4: E is correct, so ✓.\n- Position 5: E is not in the secret word (since only one E at position 4), so it should be x.\n\nBut we are trying to guess, so it\'s acceptable, but it wastes a letter.\n\nTo avoid confusion, better to avoid duplicate letters in guess.\n\nSo back to finding words.\n\nFor case 1: ? ? R E ? with no C,A,N,I,D,S and no duplicate.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""FOREMAN"" too long.\n- 5-letter: ""FOREM"" not a word.\n- ""GORED"" invalid.\n- ""HOVER"" H O V E R -> but this is ? ? ? E R, not ? ? R E ?.\n\n""BORNE"" but B O R N E -> N is absent.\n\n""PURGE"" P U R G E -> positions: 1:P,2:U,3:R,4:G,5:E -> but position 4 is G, not E. We need position 4 to be E, so this has E at 5.\n\nI think I\'m confusing the pattern.\n\nFor case 1, we want R at position 3 and E at position 4, so the word must have letter3=R and letter4=E.\n\nSo words like X X R E X.\n\nExamples:\n- ""BREAD"" but B R E A D -> position 3 is E, not R? ""BREAD"": B at1, R at2, E at3, A at4, D at5 -> not matching.\n- ""TREND"" T R E N D -> position 3 is E, not R.\n- ""CREST"" C R E S T -> C and S absent, and position 3 is E.\n\nWe need position 3=R and position 4=E.\n\n""FREED"" F R E E D -> duplicate E, and D absent.\n""GREET"" G R E E T -> duplicate E.\n""PREXY"" not a word.\n""TREYF"" not a word.\n\nIt\'s difficult. Perhaps there are no common words with R at 3 and E at 4 with the available letters.\n\nLet\'s try case 2: R at position 5, so pattern ? ? ? E R\n\nThen the word is letter1, letter2, letter3, E, R.\n\nWith available letters.\n\nExamples:\n- ""LATER"" but A is absent.\n- ""METER"" M E T E R -> duplicate E, and position 4 is E? ""METER"": M at1, E at2, T at3, E at4, R at5 -> but we need position 4 to be E, which it is, and position 5=R. But it has E at2 and E at4, so duplicate E. Also, E at2 is new? But we know E is at4, so E at2 might be absent or wrong position.\n\nBut duplicate.\n\n""POWER"" P O W E R -> positions: P at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5 -> perfect! No duplicate, and letters P,O,W are available.\n\n""POWER"" is a valid word.\n\nOther options:\n- ""TOWER"" T O W E R -> similar, T available.\n- ""MOWER"" M O W E R -> M available.\n- ""COVER"" but C absent.\n- ""HOVER"" H O V E R -> H and V available.\n- ""LOVER"" L O V E R -> L and V.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, we also have the possibility that R is at position 3, but we couldn\'t find a word, so maybe it\'s not likely? Or we missed a word.\n\nAnother word for case 1: ""BOREE"" not common.\n""FORZE"" not word.\n\nPerhaps ""QUREK"" not word.\n\nSo probably, the secret word is more likely to have R at position 5.\n\nFor the third guess, we can guess a word that has R at position 5 and E at position 4, and test other positions.\n\nFor example, ""POWER"": tests P at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.\n\nIf we guess this, and if R is indeed at position 5, we might get R(✓), and E(✓), and information about P,O,W.\n\nIf R is not at 5, then we will get R(-) for position 5, meaning R is present but not at 5, so it must be at position 3 (since positions 1 and 2 are ruled out).\n\nBut in that case, we would have to use a different word.\n\nBut with ""POWER"", we cover the case for R at 5 and also test three new letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""TOWER"" or ""MOWER"" are also good.\n\nI think ""POWER"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can include more common letters.\n\nAvailable common letters: O, T, L, etc.\n\n""LOWER"": L O W E R -> L at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.\n\n""TOWER"": T O W E R.\n\nAll similar.\n\nI\'ll go with ""POWER"".\n\nBut we have to make sure we don\'t use absent letters.\n\nP, O, W, E, R: E and R are known, P,O,W not used before.\n\nSo guess ""POWER"".\n\nBut in the feedback, we might get:\n\n- If R is at 5, then R(✓)\n- E is at 4, so E(✓)\n- Then P, O, W will be checked.\n\nIf R is not at 5, then R(-) meaning R is present but not at 5, so it must be at 3.\n\nAnd then we know.\n\nAlso, if any of P,O,W are in the word, we get feedback.\n\nSo it\'s a good guess.\n\nTherefore, third guess: POWER\n\nStep-by-step:\n\n- E is confirmed at position 4.\n- R is present but not at position 1 or 2, so must be at 3 or 5.\n- To test R at position 5 and introduce new common letters, guess ""POWER"" which places R at 5 and E at 4.\n- This will either confirm R at position 5 or reveal that R must be at position 3 (if R is marked as present but wrong position at 5).\n- Also tests P, O, W in positions 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<guess>POWER</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **E is confirmed at position 4** (from Guess 2: E(✓)).\n- **R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2** (from Guess 1: R(-) at position 2; Guess 2: R(-) at position 1).

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: absent (x)
- R: present, wrong position (-) [position 2]
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (-) [position 5]

Guess 2: RIDES
- R: present, wrong position (-) [position 1]
- I: absent (x)
- D: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) [position 4]
- S: absent (x)

Guess 3: POWER
- P: absent (x)
- O: correct position (✓) [position 2]
- W: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) [position 4]
- R: correct position (✓) [position 5]

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. **Correct positions:**
   - Position 2: O (from POWER: O(✓))
   - Position 4: E (from RIDES: E(✓) and confirmed in POWER)
   - Position 5: R (from POWER: R(✓))

2. **Absent letters:** C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W (all marked x in guesses)

3. **Present letters with known positions:**
   - O at position 2, E at position 4, R at position 5.

4. **Other present letters:**
   - From Guess 1, R was present but not at position 2, and now we know it's at position 5.
   - E was present but not at position 5, and now we know it's at position 4.

5. **Letters not yet tested:** We have used C, R, A, N, E, I, D, S, P, O, W. So absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W.

   Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But note: the secret word has O at 2, E at 4, R at 5. So the word is: _ O _ E R

We need to find the first and third letters.

From the feedback, we know that the first and third positions must be filled with letters from the available set, excluding the absent letters.

Also, we have no other known present letters? From the guesses, all letters that are present should be accounted for? Let's see:

- In Guess 1: R and E are present (and now placed).
- In Guess 2: R and E are present (R not at 1, E at 4).
- In Guess 3: O, E, R are present and correct, P and W absent.

So, are there any other letters that must be present? Not necessarily. The secret word has exactly the letters O, E, R, and two more letters that are not in the absent list.

The secret word is: [letter1] O [letter3] E R

We need to find letter1 and letter3 from the available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Common letters among these: T, L, M, H, etc.

We need to form a valid English word.

Possible words:

- Letter1 and letter3 must be chosen such that the word exists.

Examples:
- ""HOVER"" but H O V E R -> but V is available? But ""HOVER"" has V at position 3. However, we have W absent? W is absent, but V is not tried. But ""HOVER"" is H O V E R, which matches the pattern. But we need to check if V is allowed? V hasn't been tested, so it could be present or absent.

But in our guess, we can guess ""HOVER"" to test H and V.

But we have only two positions to guess, so we can guess a word that uses common letters to cover possibilities.

Since we have two unknowns, we can make a guess that tests both.

But we also need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? Not likely, but possible.

Common words with pattern _ O _ E R:

- ""BOXER"": B O X E R -> B and X are available.
- ""CODER"" but C and D are absent.
- ""FOYER"": F O Y E R -> F and Y available.
- ""HOMER"": H O M E R -> H and M available.
- ""LOVER"": L O V E R -> L and V available.
- ""MOVER"": M O V E R -> M and V available, but we know M and V not tried.
- ""ROVER"": R O V E R -> but R is at position 1? But we have R at position 5, and if R is at position 1, it would be duplicate? But in POWER, R is at 5 and correct, so if we have R at 1, it might be duplicate? But we don't know if duplicate is allowed.

But in the first guess, CRANE had no duplicate, and secret word might have duplicates? But let's avoid for now.

- ""TOWER"": T O W E R -> but W is absent (from POWER: W(x)), so invalid.

Similarly, ""POWER"" we already guessed, P absent.

So possible words: ""BOXER"", ""FOYER"", ""HOMER"", ""LOVER"", ""MOVER"", ""ROVER"" (but R duplicate), ""SOWER"" S absent, etc.

""TOTER"" T O T E R -> duplicate T? But T not tried.

But let's list without duplicates for simplicity.

- ""BOXER"": B at1, X at3
- ""FOYER"": F at1, Y at3
- ""HOMER"": H at1, M at3
- ""LOVER"": L at1, V at3
- ""MOVER"": M at1, V at3

We need to choose one that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Since we have to guess, we can pick one that tests frequent letters.

For example, T is a very common letter, but in the pattern, position 1 or 3 could be T.

Is there a word like ""TOTER""? T O T E R -> positions: T at1, O at2, T at3, E at4, R at5. Duplicate T? But it's a valid word.

""OTHER"": O T H E R -> but O is at position 2? ""OTHER"" is O T H E R, so position 1:O, but we need position 2:O, so position 1 must be different. ""OTHER"" has O at position 1, not 2. So not matching.

""OTTER"" O T T E R -> O at position 1, not 2.

No word with T at position 1 and something at 3? Like ""TOKER"" not common.

""TOWER"" has W absent.

So T might not be easy to fit.

L is common: ""LOVER"" is a good word.

Similarly, M: ""MOVER"" or ""MOWER"" but W absent.

""HOMER"" is a name, but acceptable.

""BOXER"" is common.

I think ""LOVER"" is a good choice because L and V are common.

But we can also consider that we have no information on L or V.

Similarly, ""HOVER"" is also good.

But ""HOVER"" has H and V.

To test two new letters, ""LOVER"" or ""HOVER"" are fine.

I'll go with ""LOVER"": L at position 1, V at position 3.

If we guess ""LOVER"", we can get feedback on L and V.

If L is correct at position 1, we get ✓, else if present but wrong position, -, or absent x.

Similarly for V at position 3.

And since O, E, R are fixed, they will be ✓.

So guess ""LOVER"".

But let's confirm the pattern: L O V E R -> position 1:L, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R. Matches.

And L and V are not in the absent list.

So it's a valid guess.

Therefore, fourth guess: LOVER

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The secret word has O at position 2, E at position 4, and R at position 5.
- The first and third positions are unknown and must be filled with letters not in the absent list (C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W).
- ""LOVER"" is a common word that fits the pattern and tests L at position 1 and V at position 3.
- Feedback will confirm or deny L and V, helping to solve the word.

<guess>LOVER</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Correct positions confirmed:**
  - Position 2: O (from POWER: O(✓))
  - Position 4: E (from RIDES: E(✓) and POWER: E(✓))
  - Position 5: R (from POWER: R(✓))
- **Absent letters:** C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W (marked ""x"" in feedback).
- **Secret word pattern:** The word must be _ O _ E R (unknown first and third positions).
- **Available letters:** B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z (excluding absent letters).

For the fourth guess, I need to:
- Test possible letters for positions 1 and 3.
- Use common letters to maximize information.
- Avoid absent letters.

A strong guess is **LOVER**:
- **L** at position 1: Tests a common consonant.
- **V** at position 3: Tests a less common letter, helping to confirm or eliminate possibilities.
- **O, E, R** are placed in their known correct positions (2, 4, 5) to validate the pattern.
- This guess efficiently narrows down the remaining letters while fitting the established constraints.

<guess>LOVER</guess>",LOVER,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: absent (x)
- R: present, wrong position (-) [position 2]
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (-) [position 5]

Guess 2: RIDES
- R: present, wrong position (-) [position 1]
- I: absent (x)
- D: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) [position 4]
- S: absent (x)

Guess 3: POWER
- P: absent (x)
- O: correct position (✓) [position 2]
- W: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) [position 4]
- R: correct position (✓) [position 5]

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. **Correct positions:**
   - Position 2: O (from POWER: O(✓))
   - Position 4: E (from RIDES: E(✓) and confirmed in POWER)
   - Position 5: R (from POWER: R(✓))

2. **Absent letters:** C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W (all marked x in guesses)

3. **Present letters with known positions:**
   - O at position 2, E at position 4, R at position 5.

4. **Other present letters:**
   - From Guess 1, R was present but not at position 2, and now we know it's at position 5.
   - E was present but not at position 5, and now we know it's at position 4.

5. **Letters not yet tested:** We have used C, R, A, N, E, I, D, S, P, O, W. So absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W.

   Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But note: the secret word has O at 2, E at 4, R at 5. So the word is: _ O _ E R

We need to find the first and third letters.

From the feedback, we know that the first and third positions must be filled with letters from the available set, excluding the absent letters.

Also, we have no other known present letters? From the guesses, all letters that are present should be accounted for? Let's see:

- In Guess 1: R and E are present (and now placed).
- In Guess 2: R and E are present (R not at 1, E at 4).
- In Guess 3: O, E, R are present and correct, P and W absent.

So, are there any other letters that must be present? Not necessarily. The secret word has exactly the letters O, E, R, and two more letters that are not in the absent list.

The secret word is: [letter1] O [letter3] E R

We need to find letter1 and letter3 from the available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Common letters among these: T, L, M, H, etc.

We need to form a valid English word.

Possible words:

- Letter1 and letter3 must be chosen such that the word exists.

Examples:
- ""HOVER"" but H O V E R -> but V is available? But ""HOVER"" has V at position 3. However, we have W absent? W is absent, but V is not tried. But ""HOVER"" is H O V E R, which matches the pattern. But we need to check if V is allowed? V hasn't been tested, so it could be present or absent.

But in our guess, we can guess ""HOVER"" to test H and V.

But we have only two positions to guess, so we can guess a word that uses common letters to cover possibilities.

Since we have two unknowns, we can make a guess that tests both.

But we also need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? Not likely, but possible.

Common words with pattern _ O _ E R:

- ""BOXER"": B O X E R -> B and X are available.
- ""CODER"" but C and D are absent.
- ""FOYER"": F O Y E R -> F and Y available.
- ""HOMER"": H O M E R -> H and M available.
- ""LOVER"": L O V E R -> L and V available.
- ""MOVER"": M O V E R -> M and V available, but we know M and V not tried.
- ""ROVER"": R O V E R -> but R is at position 1? But we have R at position 5, and if R is at position 1, it would be duplicate? But in POWER, R is at 5 and correct, so if we have R at 1, it might be duplicate? But we don't know if duplicate is allowed.

But in the first guess, CRANE had no duplicate, and secret word might have duplicates? But let's avoid for now.

- ""TOWER"": T O W E R -> but W is absent (from POWER: W(x)), so invalid.

Similarly, ""POWER"" we already guessed, P absent.

So possible words: ""BOXER"", ""FOYER"", ""HOMER"", ""LOVER"", ""MOVER"", ""ROVER"" (but R duplicate), ""SOWER"" S absent, etc.

""TOTER"" T O T E R -> duplicate T? But T not tried.

But let's list without duplicates for simplicity.

- ""BOXER"": B at1, X at3
- ""FOYER"": F at1, Y at3
- ""HOMER"": H at1, M at3
- ""LOVER"": L at1, V at3
- ""MOVER"": M at1, V at3

We need to choose one that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Since we have to guess, we can pick one that tests frequent letters.

For example, T is a very common letter, but in the pattern, position 1 or 3 could be T.

Is there a word like ""TOTER""? T O T E R -> positions: T at1, O at2, T at3, E at4, R at5. Duplicate T? But it's a valid word.

""OTHER"": O T H E R -> but O is at position 2? ""OTHER"" is O T H E R, so position 1:O, but we need position 2:O, so position 1 must be different. ""OTHER"" has O at position 1, not 2. So not matching.

""OTTER"" O T T E R -> O at position 1, not 2.

No word with T at position 1 and something at 3? Like ""TOKER"" not common.

""TOWER"" has W absent.

So T might not be easy to fit.

L is common: ""LOVER"" is a good word.

Similarly, M: ""MOVER"" or ""MOWER"" but W absent.

""HOMER"" is a name, but acceptable.

""BOXER"" is common.

I think ""LOVER"" is a good choice because L and V are common.

But we can also consider that we have no information on L or V.

Similarly, ""HOVER"" is also good.

But ""HOVER"" has H and V.

To test two new letters, ""LOVER"" or ""HOVER"" are fine.

I'll go with ""LOVER"": L at position 1, V at position 3.

If we guess ""LOVER"", we can get feedback on L and V.

If L is correct at position 1, we get ✓, else if present but wrong position, -, or absent x.

Similarly for V at position 3.

And since O, E, R are fixed, they will be ✓.

So guess ""LOVER"".

But let's confirm the pattern: L O V E R -> position 1:L, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R. Matches.

And L and V are not in the absent list.

So it's a valid guess.

Therefore, fourth guess: LOVER

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The secret word has O at position 2, E at position 4, and R at position 5.
- The first and third positions are unknown and must be filled with letters not in the absent list (C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W).
- ""LOVER"" is a common word that fits the pattern and tests L at position 1 and V at position 3.
- Feedback will confirm or deny L and V, helping to solve the word.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We can choose a word that covers frequent letters.

 Let's consider the frequency of letters in 5-letter English words. The most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc.

 A popular starting word is ""ROATE"" (which means the cumulative return from investments) but it's not very common. 
 Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is a good one because it has two vowels (A, I) and three common consonants (R, S, E).

 But note: the feedback symbols are case-sensitive? The example used uppercase. However, the rules don't specify. 
 We'll assume the game is case-insensitive for the word, but we'll output in uppercase as in the example.

 Another good starting word is ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E — all common letters.

 I think I'll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 However, let me check if ""CRANE"" is a valid 5-letter word. Yes, it is.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".I am starting the game and need to make my first guess. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word with common letters to maximize information. The most frequent letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, and N. A strong starting word should include several of these. ""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because it contains C (common consonant), R (2nd most common consonant), A (common vowel), N (common consonant), and E (most common vowel). This combination covers frequent letters and positions, helping me gather useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Interpretation:
- C is not in the word at all.
- R is in the word but not in the second position (where we guessed it).
- A is not in the word at all.
- N is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

So, we know:
- The word contains R and E, but not in the positions we guessed.
- The word does NOT contain C, A, N.

Since R is in the word but not in position 2, and E is in the word but not in position 5, and our guess had R in position 2 and E in position 5, they must be elsewhere.

Now, we need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word without C, A, N, and including R and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively? Actually, the position constraints: 
- R cannot be in position 2 (because feedback was R(-), meaning it's present but wrong position).
- E cannot be in position 5.

Moreover, since the word has R and E, and no C, A, N, we can list possible letters.

We also note that the word might have other letters. Since A and C are out, we should avoid vowels that are less common? We have E, so we focus on common consonants and vowels.

Common remaining letters: E, R, and others like O, I, T, S, L, etc.

But we know R is in the word, so we must include R. Similarly, E must be included.

In the new guess, we should place R in a position that is not 2, and E in a position that is not 5. Also, avoid positions 1,3,4 for R and E? Wait, the feedback doesn't say anything about positions 1,3,4 being correct or not for R and E? Actually:

- For R: only position 2 is wrong, so it could be in position 1,3,4, or even 5? But position 5 might be taken by E? Actually, E cannot be in position 5 in the secret word, so E must be in positions 1-4.

Similarly, R must be in positions 1,3,4, or 5? But we don't know about position 5 for R. Since E is in the word and not in position 5, R could be in position 5? Yes.

So constraints:
- The word must include R and E.
- R not in position 2.
- E not in position 5.
- No C, A, N.

Now, our goal is to guess a word that respects these constraints and uses common letters to test other positions.

We should also try to get information about other letters. Since E is in the word, let's think about possible positions.

Possible positions for E: since not at 5, it must be at 1,2,3, or 4.
Similarly for R: not at 2, so at 1,3,4,5.

We should avoid placing E in position 5 (already forbidden) and R in position 2.

But in our new guess, we can put E and R in any positions we want, remembering the feedback rules.

What word to choose? Let's think of common words with R and E, and without C, A, N.

Also, the word should not reuse letters that are already known absent: C, A, N.

We have already used C, R, A, N, E. From this, we know E and R are present, so we should reuse E and R in the new guess? But note: in Wordle-like games, reusing letters that are present is good to find their positions.

So, we must include R and E in our new guess.

We need a word that contains R and E, not containing C, A, N.

Possible words: 
- Words like ""ROBES"", ""STORE"", ""GUIDE"" (but GUIDEs has D and U, and E at end? We know E not at end? No, E not at position 5, so in STORE E is at 5, which is forbidden? Yes, so avoid words ending with E.

In the secret word, E cannot be at position 5, but in our guess, we can put E at any position? Yes, because we are testing. However, if we put E at position 5, we expect it to be marked x or -, but we know in the secret word E is not at position 5, so if we put E at 5, it will be wrong position? Actually, feedback: if we put E at 5, and E is in the word elsewhere, it will show -. If E is not at 5, and we guess E at 5, it will be wrong position only if E is present? Yes.

But to avoid wasting the E test, we should put E in a position where it might be correct, i.e., positions 1-4.

Similarly for R, avoid position 2.

So, good choices: put R in position 1,3,4, or 5; and E in position 1,2,3, or 4.

Now, what about the other letters? We need new letters to test.

Possible candidates:

- Words beginning with R: e.g., ""RESTS"", but S in it. But we don't know anything about S. However, ""RESTS"" has E at position 2 and R at 1, which we can test.

But ""RESTS"" has T and S, common letters.

But also, we want to use letters not yet tried? Yes, to get more information.

Letters tried so far: C, R, A, N, E. So we haven't tried S, T, O, I, L, etc.

Good words: ""RISES"" has I and S. But A is forbidden? Yes, but no A. However, ""RISES"" has R at 1, I at 2, S at 3, E at 4, S at 5. Position: E at 4, and R at 1 (which is not position 2). Good. And no C,A,N.

But in the secret word, E is present but not at position 5? Here E is at 4.

Possibly.

Word ""ROLES"": R at 1, O at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5. E at 4 (which is allowed for secret word), R at 1 (not position 2). Good.

But we need to see which one is better.

Another word: ""TRIES"" - T, R, I, E, S. Positions: R at 2? But R cannot be at position 2 because the feedback for our first guess told us R is not in position 2. So if we put R at position 2, it will be wrong again? No, the secret word has R, but not at position 2. So in a new position, we must avoid putting R at position 2 because we know it's not there.

In ""TRIES"": T position 1, R position 2. But R at position 2 in the guess would trigger a ""-"" because R is present but not in position 2. But we are not learning new? We are confirming that position 2 is wrong for R. But since we already know that, it's redundant.

To maximize new information, we should place R in a position where it might be correct, i.e., positions 1,3,4,5.

For example, ""TRIES"" with R at position 2 is inefficient because it re-tests position 2.

Better to put R at a new position.

Similarly for E, avoid position 5? But E at position 5: we know in secret word E is not at 5, so if we guess E at 5, we'll just get a ""-"" which tells us E is elsewhere, but we already know E is present. So it wastes a chance to pinpoint E's position? Yes.

Therefore, best to put E in one of positions 1-4 to see if that position is correct.

Similarly for R, put in positions 1,3,4,5 (avoiding 2).

Now, let's list possible words.

Option 1: ""PORTS"" - has P,O,R,T,S. But E is required? We must include E because we know E is in the word. If we don't include E, and E is in the word, we may miss it? But the word must contain E? No, our guess doesn't have to include E if we are testing other letters? But we know E is in the secret word, so to get information about E's position, we should include it? Not necessarily, but including E helps us to find its position.

Including E and R in the guess is efficient because we can test new positions.

If we skip E or R, we might get less information.

So prioritise words with both E and R.

Words with R and E, no C,A,N, E not at end? Optional in guess, but as reasoned, better to avoid E at 5 for new guess.

Some options:

- ""SERVE"": S, E, R, V, E? Letters: E at pos1, R at pos3, and E at pos5? But E at 5: since we know E is not at 5 in secret word, if we guess E at 5, we'll get ""-"" meaning E is present but not at that position. But we have two E's? And in ""SERVE"", E is at position 1 and 5.

But the secret word might or might not have duplicates? But in our first guess, we had no duplicates, so we don't know if duplicates are possible.

But to avoid complications, guess words without duplicates for now.

Better single E.

Word ""ROGUE"": R at 1, O at 2, G at 3, U at 4, E at 5. But E at 5: if we guess E at 5, and secret word E not at 5, we'll get ""-"". Also, U is less common.

Word ""RIDES"": R at 1, I at 2, D at 3, E at 4, S at 5. E at position 4 (good, not 5), R at position 1 (good, not 2). Also, includes D and S, which are untested.

Similarly, ""TREES"": T, R, E, E, S? Duplicate E, and R at 2? Avoid R at 2.

""DRIVE"": D at 1, R at 2? Avoid R at 2.

""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E. Positions: R at position 2? Avoid position 2 for R.

How about ""SPIRE"": S, P, I, R, E? E at position 5? Avoid E at 5 if possible. Put E at position 5? We'll get ""-"", but we could.

But to conserve, better put E in 1-4.

So back to ""RIDES"": R at 1, I at 2, D at 3, E at 4, S at 5. 
- R position 1: If R is at position 1 for secret word, we get ✓, else ""-"".
- E position 4: similar.
- Also tests I,D,S.

Another option: ""ROPES"": R at 1, O at 2, P at 3, E at 4, S at 5. Similarly.

""ROPES"" has O and P, which are common.

""RIDES"": R, I, D, E, S.

We also have ""REUSE"": R at 1? But ""REUSE"" has two E's? Not ideal. ""REUSE"": R, E, U, S, E? E at position 2 and 5.

Avoid.

Better ""RIDES"" or ""ROPES"", or ""TILES""? But TILES has T,I,L,E,S but no R? We must include R? Not mandatory for guess, but to test R, better include.

We know R is present, so including it can confirm position.

Option: ""RETCH"" but C is out? We have C as absent, ""RETCH"" has C? No, C is invalid? ""RETCH"" has C? The word contains C? Yes, so avoid.

""RESTS"": R, E, S, T, S? But R at position 1, E at position 2, S at 3 and 5? And T at 4? Good positions? E at 2: since E is present but not necessarily at 2. But we don't have any constraint on E position except not 5? And R not at 2. In ""RESTS"", R at 1 (okay), E at 2 (could be), and avoids E at 5.

Also, includes S and T, common letters.

But duplicate S? Not a problem necessarily.

Compared to ""RIDES"": both have S at the end? ""RESTS"" ends with S, ""RIDES"" also ends with S.

But ""RESTS"" might be better because it also has T.

But E is at position 2 in ""RESTS"", while in ""RIDES"" E is at 4.

We don't know which positions E might be.

Now, deciding between ""RESTS"" and ""RIDES"".

Perhaps ""STREP"", but that ends with P? ""STREP"": S,T,R,E,P. E at 4? R at 3? Positions: position1=S,2=T,3=R,4=E,5=P? Then S,T,R,E,P.

R is at position 3 (which is not 2, allowed), E at position 4 (not 5, avoided).

And includes S,T,P.

Also, all unique letters? ""STREP"" has S,T,R,E,P — unique letters.

Good candidate.

But ""STREP"" means a type of bacteria? Might be obscure. Is ""strep"" a valid common word? Not ideal.

Perhaps ""STRIP"" but no E? Must have E? Not required, but E is in word? We should include E.

Then ""SERVE"" as I thought earlier: S, E, R, V, E? E at 1 and 5? Duplicate E.

Bad.

""VERSE"": V,E,R,S,E? Duplicate E.

""GRIPE"": G,R,I,P,E? E at 5? We avoid E at 5.

But if we guess E at 5, we get ""-"" meaning E present but elsewhere.

But to save a position test, better not.

""GRIME"": G,R,I,M,E? E at 5.

Same.

""BRIDE"": B,R,I,D,E? B might be good? But we have to avoid B? No, only C,A,N are out. B hasn't been tried.

Positions: R at 2? Avoid R at 2. In ""BRIDE"", R is at 2? So position 2 for R? Bad.

Avoid R at 2: so for words, R should be first, third, fourth, or last.

Perhaps ""OREAD"": O,R,E,A,D? A is out? A is not allowed? We know A is not in word? Feedback said A(x), so absent, thus OREAD has A? Position 4? So invalid guess because A is out.

Thus avoid words containing A,C, or N.

So words must consist of letters not C,A,N.

Letters available: B,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But with R and E included.

Another word: ""WISER"": W,I,S,E,R? Positions: R at last position? R at 5? Good. E at position 4? Okay. And W,I,S.

""RIPER"": R,I,P,E,R? Duplicate R? Avoid.

Perhaps ""DRIFT"": D,R,I,F,T? No E? Omit E.

Yes, we can omit E since we know E is present, and it might be tested in later guesses? But better to include now.

""WRIST"": W,R,I,S,T? No E.

But E is known present, so guess should include E to find position.

Therefore, going back, ""RIDES"" seems good: R in position 1, E in position 4, and I,D,S are new.

""RIDES"" is a word? Yes, like horse rides.

Similarly, ""ROPES"" is also common.

""ROPES"" has O, which is vowel.

But both options are fine.

I think I choose ""RIDES"" for its commonality.

But ""RESTS"" might be more common? ""RESTS"" has duplicate S? But that's okay.

Another good one: ""STORE"" but E at 5? Avoid if possible.

How about ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E? But E at 5. No, E at 5 not desired. And no R? Omit R.

Must include R? Not enforced, but we know R is present so exclude?

If we guess without R, we might get feedback that misses the R position? But we can infer.

For example, if we guess ""STOLE"", we might:
- Get S, T, O, L, E feedback.
But E at 5, we know E is present but not at 5, so we'll get E(-).
But we also know R is present, but not in the guess, so the feedback won't tell us anything about R. Meaning, we won't test new positions for R.

To be efficient, better reuse known present letters R and E in new positions.

Therefore, I decide to use ""RIDES"": R in position 1, I in position 2, D in position 3, E in position 4, S in position 5.

So, guess: RIDES

Step-by-step reasoning: Since R is present but not at position 2, I place R at position 1 to test if it's there. E is present not at position 5, so I place at position 4. The word includes new letters I, D, S to gather more information.Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- **C, A, N** are **not in the word**.
- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2**.
- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the second guess, I need to include both **R and E** (since they exist in the word) but avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5. I also cannot use **C, A, or N**. Ideally, the new guess should test new positions for R and E and introduce common unused letters to gather more information.

A strong candidate is **RIDES**:
- **R** is placed in **position 1** (a possible correct position; previously not tested).
- **E** is placed in **position 4** (avoiding position 5 and testing a new potential spot).
- **I, D, S** are new letters (common consonants/vowels not yet tested).
- Avoids all forbidden letters (no C, A, N) and aligns with constraints.

This should help narrow down the position of R and E while covering frequent English letters.

<guess>RIDES</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: RIDES -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: CRANE
- C: absent (x)
- R: present but wrong position (-) [since it was in position 2, but not there]
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-) [position 5 is wrong]

Second guess: RIDES
- R: present but wrong position (-) [we placed R at position 1, but it's not there]
- I: absent (x)
- D: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) [we placed E at position 4, and it is correct!]
- S: absent (x)

So, what do we know?
1. The secret word has the letter E in position 4. (Great! So E is fixed at the 4th position.)
2. The letter R is in the word, but it is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 1 (from second guess). So R must be in position 3 or 5? (Positions: 1,2,3,4,5; but position 4 is E, so R can be in 3 or 5.)
3. The following letters are absent: C, A, N, I, D, S. (So we cannot use these letters.)

Also, from the first guess, we know E is present and not at position 5, which is consistent because now we know E is at 4.

Now, the secret word has E at position 4, and R is present but not at 1 or 2. So R must be at position 3 or 5.

Additionally, we have no information about other letters. We have used: C, R, A, N, E, I, D, S. So absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need to form a 5-letter word that has E at position 4 and R at either position 3 or 5.

Also, the word must include R (since it's present) and we know E is at 4.

Now, for the third guess, we should try to determine the position of R and also test other letters.

We have two cases for R: position 3 or 5.

We can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we can only test one word.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R in position 3 and then see, or in position 5.

But we also want to test other common letters.

Since E is fixed at 4, the word pattern is: _ _ _ E _

And R must be in the third or fifth position.

So possible patterns: 
- If R is at 3: _ _ R E _
- If R is at 5: _ _ _ E R

We need to fill the other positions with new letters.

We should avoid the absent letters: C,A,N,I,D,S.

Let's think of words that fit these patterns.

First, pattern: _ _ R E _

Possible words: 
- With R at 3: e.g., ""CARE"" but C and A are out. Not possible.
- ""BARE"" but A is out.
- ""FIRE"" but I is out? I is absent? Yes, I is absent. So no.
- ""MORE"": M, O, R, E, ? -> but E is at 4, so ""MORE"" would be M O R E, but we need 5 letters? ""MORE"" is 4 letters. We need 5-letter words.

5-letter words with pattern _ _ R E _

Examples:
- ""STORE"" but S and T? S is absent, T is available? S is absent, so no.
- ""CHORE"" but C and H? C is absent, so no.
- ""WHORE"" but W,H,O,R,E? But O is available, but we have E at 4, so ""WHORE"" is W H O R E -> positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:O? No, we need R at position 3. ""WHORE"" has R at 4? W H O R E -> 1:W, 2:H, 3:O, 4:R, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, so position 4 must be E, but here it's R? Not matching.

We need the fourth letter to be E, so for pattern _ _ R E _, it means:
Position 1: ?
Position 2: ?
Position 3: R
Position 4: E
Position 5: ?

Similarly, for pattern _ _ _ E R: 
Position 1: ?
Position 2: ?
Position 3: ?
Position 4: E
Position 5: R

Now, let's find words for pattern 1: _ _ R E _

With available letters: no C,A,N,I,D,S.

Possible words:
- ""PARER"" but P,A,R,E,R? A is absent, and duplicate R? Also, E at 4? ""PARER"": P A R E R -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:R, 4:E, 5:R -> but A is absent, so invalid.
- ""MOVER"": M O V E R? But E is at 4? ""MOVER"": M O V E R -> 1:M, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R -> this is pattern _ _ _ E R, not _ _ R E _.

For pattern _ _ R E _:
- ""BORED"": B O R E D -> but D is absent? D is absent, so no.
- ""FOREX""? Not common word.
- ""GORED"": G O R E D -> D absent.
- ""HORDE"": H O R D E -> D absent, and E at 5? ""HORDE"" is H O R D E -> 1:H,2:O,3:R,4:D,5:E -> but we need E at 4, so position 4 is D? Not E. So no.

It seems hard to find a word for _ _ R E _ with the constraints.

Perhaps ""MURRE"" or ""PURGE""? 
- ""PURGE"": P U R G E -> 1:P, 2:U, 3:R, 4:G, 5:E -> position 4 is G, not E. So no.

We need position 4 to be E, so for pattern _ _ R E _, it must have E at position 4? No: the pattern is _ _ R E _, meaning:
Position 1: letter
Position 2: letter
Position 3: R
Position 4: E
Position 5: letter

But in ""PURGE"", position 4 is G, not E.

So we need a word where position 4 is E and position 3 is R? But we are considering the case where R is at position 3.

But in the word, position 4 is fixed as E, so if R is at 3, then we have ... R E ...

But let's list words ending with ""RE"" but that's position 4 and 5? No.

Perhaps it's easier to think of words that have E at position 4.

So the word must be: ? ? ? E ?

And R must be at 3 or 5.

Case 1: R at position 3: then word is ? ? R E ?
Case 2: R at position 5: then word is ? ? ? E R

Now, for case 1: ? ? R E ?

With available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding C,A,N,I,D,S)

Possible words:
- ""BORED"" -> B O R E D -> but D is absent, invalid.
- ""FIRED"" -> F I R E D -> I and D absent.
- ""HORDE"" -> H O R D E -> D absent, and E at 5? No, position 4 is D? H O R D E: pos4=D, pos5=E -> not E at 4.
- ""LURED"" -> L U R E D -> D absent.
- ""MURKY"" -> M U R K Y -> no E at 4? Position 4 is K, not E.
- ""PUREE"" -> P U R E E -> but E at 4 and 5? ""PUREE"": P U R E E -> pos1:P,2:U,3:R,4:E,5:E -> this fits: ? ? R E ? with ? at 1,2,5 being P,U,E? But E at 5 is duplicate? And E is at 4 and 5.

But the secret word has E at position 4, but it might have another E? We don't know. But in our first guess, we had E and it was not at 5, but now we know E is at 4, so position 5 could be E? But the feedback for first guess E(-) at position 5 means that E is not at 5, so the secret word does not have E at position 5. Therefore, position 5 cannot be E. So ""PUREE"" has E at 5, which would be invalid for secret word? But we are guessing, so we can guess it, but it would be inconsistent with what we know? No, we can guess it, but we know that if we guess E at 5, it will be marked absent (since E is not at 5) or if the word has duplicate E? But we don't know if duplicate E is possible.

But from first guess, E was not at 5, but it could be at 4 and also at 5? No, because if E were at 5, the first guess would have shown E as correct or wrong position? In first guess, we had E at position 5, and it was marked (-) meaning present but wrong position. That means E is in the word but not at position 5. So if E were also at position 4, it would still be marked present but not at 5. But the feedback doesn't tell us about position 4. So it's possible that E is at 4 and not at 5, and no duplicate.

But in ""PUREE"", we have E at 4 and 5, but we know E is not at 5, so for secret word, position 5 cannot be E. Therefore, ""PUREE"" as a guess is okay, but it has E at 5 which we know is wrong, so it will be marked as present but wrong position? But E is already at 4, which is correct, so position 5 E would be marked as absent? Let's think about feedback rules.

If the secret word has only one E, and we guess two E's, then:
- If we guess E at position 4 and it is correct, it gets ✓.
- If we guess E at position 5 and the secret word has no E at 5, it should be marked x (absent) if there is no second E? But the feedback for duplicate letters: typically in Wordle, if the letter appears once, and you guess it twice, the second one might be marked x if not present.

Standard Wordle rules: for duplicate letters, if the secret has one E, and you guess two E's, the first one in correct position gets ✓, and the second one in wrong position gets x (because there's no extra E). Or if the first one is in wrong position, it gets -, and the second one might get x.

But in this case, for ""PUREE"" as a guess:
- Position 4: E is correct, so ✓.
- Position 5: E is not in the secret word (since only one E at position 4), so it should be x.

But we are trying to guess, so it's acceptable, but it wastes a letter.

To avoid confusion, better to avoid duplicate letters in guess.

So back to finding words.

For case 1: ? ? R E ? with no C,A,N,I,D,S and no duplicate.

Possible words: 
- ""FOREMAN"" too long.
- 5-letter: ""FOREM"" not a word.
- ""GORED"" invalid.
- ""HOVER"" H O V E R -> but this is ? ? ? E R, not ? ? R E ?.

""BORNE"" but B O R N E -> N is absent.

""PURGE"" P U R G E -> positions: 1:P,2:U,3:R,4:G,5:E -> but position 4 is G, not E. We need position 4 to be E, so this has E at 5.

I think I'm confusing the pattern.

For case 1, we want R at position 3 and E at position 4, so the word must have letter3=R and letter4=E.

So words like X X R E X.

Examples:
- ""BREAD"" but B R E A D -> position 3 is E, not R? ""BREAD"": B at1, R at2, E at3, A at4, D at5 -> not matching.
- ""TREND"" T R E N D -> position 3 is E, not R.
- ""CREST"" C R E S T -> C and S absent, and position 3 is E.

We need position 3=R and position 4=E.

""FREED"" F R E E D -> duplicate E, and D absent.
""GREET"" G R E E T -> duplicate E.
""PREXY"" not a word.
""TREYF"" not a word.

It's difficult. Perhaps there are no common words with R at 3 and E at 4 with the available letters.

Let's try case 2: R at position 5, so pattern ? ? ? E R

Then the word is letter1, letter2, letter3, E, R.

With available letters.

Examples:
- ""LATER"" but A is absent.
- ""METER"" M E T E R -> duplicate E, and position 4 is E? ""METER"": M at1, E at2, T at3, E at4, R at5 -> but we need position 4 to be E, which it is, and position 5=R. But it has E at2 and E at4, so duplicate E. Also, E at2 is new? But we know E is at4, so E at2 might be absent or wrong position.

But duplicate.

""POWER"" P O W E R -> positions: P at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5 -> perfect! No duplicate, and letters P,O,W are available.

""POWER"" is a valid word.

Other options:
- ""TOWER"" T O W E R -> similar, T available.
- ""MOWER"" M O W E R -> M available.
- ""COVER"" but C absent.
- ""HOVER"" H O V E R -> H and V available.
- ""LOVER"" L O V E R -> L and V.

All good.

Now, we also have the possibility that R is at position 3, but we couldn't find a word, so maybe it's not likely? Or we missed a word.

Another word for case 1: ""BOREE"" not common.
""FORZE"" not word.

Perhaps ""QUREK"" not word.

So probably, the secret word is more likely to have R at position 5.

For the third guess, we can guess a word that has R at position 5 and E at position 4, and test other positions.

For example, ""POWER"": tests P at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.

If we guess this, and if R is indeed at position 5, we might get R(✓), and E(✓), and information about P,O,W.

If R is not at 5, then we will get R(-) for position 5, meaning R is present but not at 5, so it must be at position 3 (since positions 1 and 2 are ruled out).

But in that case, we would have to use a different word.

But with ""POWER"", we cover the case for R at 5 and also test three new letters.

Similarly, ""TOWER"" or ""MOWER"" are also good.

I think ""POWER"" is fine.

But let's see if we can include more common letters.

Available common letters: O, T, L, etc.

""LOWER"": L O W E R -> L at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.

""TOWER"": T O W E R.

All similar.

I'll go with ""POWER"".

But we have to make sure we don't use absent letters.

P, O, W, E, R: E and R are known, P,O,W not used before.

So guess ""POWER"".

But in the feedback, we might get:

- If R is at 5, then R(✓)
- E is at 4, so E(✓)
- Then P, O, W will be checked.

If R is not at 5, then R(-) meaning R is present but not at 5, so it must be at 3.

And then we know.

Also, if any of P,O,W are in the word, we get feedback.

So it's a good guess.

Therefore, third guess: POWER

Step-by-step:

- E is confirmed at position 4.
- R is present but not at position 1 or 2, so must be at 3 or 5.
- To test R at position 5 and introduce new common letters, guess ""POWER"" which places R at 5 and E at 4.
- This will either confirm R at position 5 or reveal that R must be at position 3 (if R is marked as present but wrong position at 5).
- Also tests P, O, W in positions 1, 2, and 3.

<guess>POWER</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **E is confirmed at position 4** (from Guess 2: E(✓)).
- **R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2** (from Guess 1: R(-) at position 2; Guess 2: R(-) at position 1). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 5.
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, I, D, S (marked ""x"" in feedback).
- **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the third guess, I need to:
- Test the position of R (position 3 or 5).
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.
- Keep E fixed at position 4.

A strong guess is **POWER**:
- **P, O, W** are new, common letters not yet tested.
- **E** is placed at position 4 (confirmed correct).
- **R** is placed at position 5 (testing if R is at position 5; if not, it must be at position 3).
- Avoids all absent letters (C, A, N, I, D, S).

This guess efficiently narrows down R's position while covering frequent English letters.

<guess>POWER</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: RIDES -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x)
Guess 3: POWER -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: absent (x)
- R: present, wrong position (-) [position 2]
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (-) [position 5]

Guess 2: RIDES
- R: present, wrong position (-) [position 1]
- I: absent (x)
- D: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) [position 4]
- S: absent (x)

Guess 3: POWER
- P: absent (x)
- O: correct position (✓) [position 2]
- W: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) [position 4]
- R: correct position (✓) [position 5]

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. **Correct positions:**
   - Position 2: O (from POWER: O(✓))
   - Position 4: E (from RIDES: E(✓) and confirmed in POWER)
   - Position 5: R (from POWER: R(✓))

2. **Absent letters:** C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W (all marked x in guesses)

3. **Present letters with known positions:**
   - O at position 2, E at position 4, R at position 5.

4. **Other present letters:**
   - From Guess 1, R was present but not at position 2, and now we know it's at position 5.
   - E was present but not at position 5, and now we know it's at position 4.

5. **Letters not yet tested:** We have used C, R, A, N, E, I, D, S, P, O, W. So absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W.

   Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But note: the secret word has O at 2, E at 4, R at 5. So the word is: _ O _ E R

We need to find the first and third letters.

From the feedback, we know that the first and third positions must be filled with letters from the available set, excluding the absent letters.

Also, we have no other known present letters? From the guesses, all letters that are present should be accounted for? Let's see:

- In Guess 1: R and E are present (and now placed).
- In Guess 2: R and E are present (R not at 1, E at 4).
- In Guess 3: O, E, R are present and correct, P and W absent.

So, are there any other letters that must be present? Not necessarily. The secret word has exactly the letters O, E, R, and two more letters that are not in the absent list.

The secret word is: [letter1] O [letter3] E R

We need to find letter1 and letter3 from the available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Common letters among these: T, L, M, H, etc.

We need to form a valid English word.

Possible words:

- Letter1 and letter3 must be chosen such that the word exists.

Examples:
- ""HOVER"" but H O V E R -> but V is available? But ""HOVER"" has V at position 3. However, we have W absent? W is absent, but V is not tried. But ""HOVER"" is H O V E R, which matches the pattern. But we need to check if V is allowed? V hasn't been tested, so it could be present or absent.

But in our guess, we can guess ""HOVER"" to test H and V.

But we have only two positions to guess, so we can guess a word that uses common letters to cover possibilities.

Since we have two unknowns, we can make a guess that tests both.

But we also need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? Not likely, but possible.

Common words with pattern _ O _ E R:

- ""BOXER"": B O X E R -> B and X are available.
- ""CODER"" but C and D are absent.
- ""FOYER"": F O Y E R -> F and Y available.
- ""HOMER"": H O M E R -> H and M available.
- ""LOVER"": L O V E R -> L and V available.
- ""MOVER"": M O V E R -> M and V available, but we know M and V not tried.
- ""ROVER"": R O V E R -> but R is at position 1? But we have R at position 5, and if R is at position 1, it would be duplicate? But in POWER, R is at 5 and correct, so if we have R at 1, it might be duplicate? But we don't know if duplicate is allowed.

But in the first guess, CRANE had no duplicate, and secret word might have duplicates? But let's avoid for now.

- ""TOWER"": T O W E R -> but W is absent (from POWER: W(x)), so invalid.

Similarly, ""POWER"" we already guessed, P absent.

So possible words: ""BOXER"", ""FOYER"", ""HOMER"", ""LOVER"", ""MOVER"", ""ROVER"" (but R duplicate), ""SOWER"" S absent, etc.

""TOTER"" T O T E R -> duplicate T? But T not tried.

But let's list without duplicates for simplicity.

- ""BOXER"": B at1, X at3
- ""FOYER"": F at1, Y at3
- ""HOMER"": H at1, M at3
- ""LOVER"": L at1, V at3
- ""MOVER"": M at1, V at3

We need to choose one that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Since we have to guess, we can pick one that tests frequent letters.

For example, T is a very common letter, but in the pattern, position 1 or 3 could be T.

Is there a word like ""TOTER""? T O T E R -> positions: T at1, O at2, T at3, E at4, R at5. Duplicate T? But it's a valid word.

""OTHER"": O T H E R -> but O is at position 2? ""OTHER"" is O T H E R, so position 1:O, but we need position 2:O, so position 1 must be different. ""OTHER"" has O at position 1, not 2. So not matching.

""OTTER"" O T T E R -> O at position 1, not 2.

No word with T at position 1 and something at 3? Like ""TOKER"" not common.

""TOWER"" has W absent.

So T might not be easy to fit.

L is common: ""LOVER"" is a good word.

Similarly, M: ""MOVER"" or ""MOWER"" but W absent.

""HOMER"" is a name, but acceptable.

""BOXER"" is common.

I think ""LOVER"" is a good choice because L and V are common.

But we can also consider that we have no information on L or V.

Similarly, ""HOVER"" is also good.

But ""HOVER"" has H and V.

To test two new letters, ""LOVER"" or ""HOVER"" are fine.

I'll go with ""LOVER"": L at position 1, V at position 3.

If we guess ""LOVER"", we can get feedback on L and V.

If L is correct at position 1, we get ✓, else if present but wrong position, -, or absent x.

Similarly for V at position 3.

And since O, E, R are fixed, they will be ✓.

So guess ""LOVER"".

But let's confirm the pattern: L O V E R -> position 1:L, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R. Matches.

And L and V are not in the absent list.

So it's a valid guess.

Therefore, fourth guess: LOVER

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The secret word has O at position 2, E at position 4, and R at position 5.
- The first and third positions are unknown and must be filled with letters not in the absent list (C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W).
- ""LOVER"" is a common word that fits the pattern and tests L at position 1 and V at position 3.
- Feedback will confirm or deny L and V, helping to solve the word.

<guess>LOVER</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Correct positions confirmed:**
  - Position 2: O (from POWER: O(✓))
  - Position 4: E (from RIDES: E(✓) and POWER: E(✓))
  - Position 5: R (from POWER: R(✓))
- **Absent letters:** C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W (marked ""x"" in feedback).
- **Secret word pattern:** The word must be _ O _ E R (unknown first and third positions).
- **Available letters:** B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z (excluding absent letters).

For the fourth guess, I need to:
- Test possible letters for positions 1 and 3.
- Use common letters to maximize information.
- Avoid absent letters.

A strong guess is **LOVER**:
- **L** at position 1: Tests a common consonant.
- **V** at position 3: Tests a less common letter, helping to confirm or eliminate possibilities.
- **O, E, R** are placed in their known correct positions (2, 4, 5) to validate the pattern.
- This guess efficiently narrows down the remaining letters while fitting the established constraints.

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.\n Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We can choose a word that covers frequent letters.\n\n Let\'s consider the frequency of letters in 5-letter English words. The most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc.\n\n A popular starting word is ""ROATE"" (which means the cumulative return from investments) but it\'s not very common. \n Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is a good one because it has two vowels (A, I) and three common consonants (R, S, E).\n\n But note: the feedback symbols are case-sensitive? The example used uppercase. However, the rules don\'t specify. \n We\'ll assume the game is case-insensitive for the word, but we\'ll output in uppercase as in the example.\n\n Another good starting word is ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E — all common letters.\n\n I think I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.\n\n However, let me check if ""CRANE"" is a valid 5-letter word. Yes, it is.\n\n So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".I am starting the game and need to make my first guess. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word with common letters to maximize information. The most frequent letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, and N. A strong starting word should include several of these. ""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because it contains C (common consonant), R (2nd most common consonant), A (common vowel), N (common consonant), and E (most common vowel). This combination covers frequent letters and positions, helping me gather useful feedback for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)\nInterpretation:\n- C is not in the word at all.\n- R is in the word but not in the second position (where we guessed it).\n- A is not in the word at all.\n- N is not in the word at all.\n- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.\n\nSo, we know:\n- The word contains R and E, but not in the positions we guessed.\n- The word does NOT contain C, A, N.\n\nSince R is in the word but not in position 2, and E is in the word but not in position 5, and our guess had R in position 2 and E in position 5, they must be elsewhere.\n\nNow, we need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word without C, A, N, and including R and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively? Actually, the position constraints: \n- R cannot be in position 2 (because feedback was R(-), meaning it\'s present but wrong position).\n- E cannot be in position 5.\n\nMoreover, since the word has R and E, and no C, A, N, we can list possible letters.\n\nWe also note that the word might have other letters. Since A and C are out, we should avoid vowels that are less common? We have E, so we focus on common consonants and vowels.\n\nCommon remaining letters: E, R, and others like O, I, T, S, L, etc.\n\nBut we know R is in the word, so we must include R. Similarly, E must be included.\n\nIn the new guess, we should place R in a position that is not 2, and E in a position that is not 5. Also, avoid positions 1,3,4 for R and E? Wait, the feedback doesn\'t say anything about positions 1,3,4 being correct or not for R and E? Actually:\n\n- For R: only position 2 is wrong, so it could be in position 1,3,4, or even 5? But position 5 might be taken by E? Actually, E cannot be in position 5 in the secret word, so E must be in positions 1-4.\n\nSimilarly, R must be in positions 1,3,4, or 5? But we don\'t know about position 5 for R. Since E is in the word and not in position 5, R could be in position 5? Yes.\n\nSo constraints:\n- The word must include R and E.\n- R not in position 2.\n- E not in position 5.\n- No C, A, N.\n\nNow, our goal is to guess a word that respects these constraints and uses common letters to test other positions.\n\nWe should also try to get information about other letters. Since E is in the word, let\'s think about possible positions.\n\nPossible positions for E: since not at 5, it must be at 1,2,3, or 4.\nSimilarly for R: not at 2, so at 1,3,4,5.\n\nWe should avoid placing E in position 5 (already forbidden) and R in position 2.\n\nBut in our new guess, we can put E and R in any positions we want, remembering the feedback rules.\n\nWhat word to choose? Let\'s think of common words with R and E, and without C, A, N.\n\nAlso, the word should not reuse letters that are already known absent: C, A, N.\n\nWe have already used C, R, A, N, E. From this, we know E and R are present, so we should reuse E and R in the new guess? But note: in Wordle-like games, reusing letters that are present is good to find their positions.\n\nSo, we must include R and E in our new guess.\n\nWe need a word that contains R and E, not containing C, A, N.\n\nPossible words: \n- Words like ""ROBES"", ""STORE"", ""GUIDE"" (but GUIDEs has D and U, and E at end? We know E not at end? No, E not at position 5, so in STORE E is at 5, which is forbidden? Yes, so avoid words ending with E.\n\nIn the secret word, E cannot be at position 5, but in our guess, we can put E at any position? Yes, because we are testing. However, if we put E at position 5, we expect it to be marked x or -, but we know in the secret word E is not at position 5, so if we put E at 5, it will be wrong position? Actually, feedback: if we put E at 5, and E is in the word elsewhere, it will show -. If E is not at 5, and we guess E at 5, it will be wrong position only if E is present? Yes.\n\nBut to avoid wasting the E test, we should put E in a position where it might be correct, i.e., positions 1-4.\n\nSimilarly for R, avoid position 2.\n\nSo, good choices: put R in position 1,3,4, or 5; and E in position 1,2,3, or 4.\n\nNow, what about the other letters? We need new letters to test.\n\nPossible candidates:\n\n- Words beginning with R: e.g., ""RESTS"", but S in it. But we don\'t know anything about S. However, ""RESTS"" has E at position 2 and R at 1, which we can test.\n\nBut ""RESTS"" has T and S, common letters.\n\nBut also, we want to use letters not yet tried? Yes, to get more information.\n\nLetters tried so far: C, R, A, N, E. So we haven\'t tried S, T, O, I, L, etc.\n\nGood words: ""RISES"" has I and S. But A is forbidden? Yes, but no A. However, ""RISES"" has R at 1, I at 2, S at 3, E at 4, S at 5. Position: E at 4, and R at 1 (which is not position 2). Good. And no C,A,N.\n\nBut in the secret word, E is present but not at position 5? Here E is at 4.\n\nPossibly.\n\nWord ""ROLES"": R at 1, O at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5. E at 4 (which is allowed for secret word), R at 1 (not position 2). Good.\n\nBut we need to see which one is better.\n\nAnother word: ""TRIES"" - T, R, I, E, S. Positions: R at 2? But R cannot be at position 2 because the feedback for our first guess told us R is not in position 2. So if we put R at position 2, it will be wrong again? No, the secret word has R, but not at position 2. So in a new position, we must avoid putting R at position 2 because we know it\'s not there.\n\nIn ""TRIES"": T position 1, R position 2. But R at position 2 in the guess would trigger a ""-"" because R is present but not in position 2. But we are not learning new? We are confirming that position 2 is wrong for R. But since we already know that, it\'s redundant.\n\nTo maximize new information, we should place R in a position where it might be correct, i.e., positions 1,3,4,5.\n\nFor example, ""TRIES"" with R at position 2 is inefficient because it re-tests position 2.\n\nBetter to put R at a new position.\n\nSimilarly for E, avoid position 5? But E at position 5: we know in secret word E is not at 5, so if we guess E at 5, we\'ll just get a ""-"" which tells us E is elsewhere, but we already know E is present. So it wastes a chance to pinpoint E\'s position? Yes.\n\nTherefore, best to put E in one of positions 1-4 to see if that position is correct.\n\nSimilarly for R, put in positions 1,3,4,5 (avoiding 2).\n\nNow, let\'s list possible words.\n\nOption 1: ""PORTS"" - has P,O,R,T,S. But E is required? We must include E because we know E is in the word. If we don\'t include E, and E is in the word, we may miss it? But the word must contain E? No, our guess doesn\'t have to include E if we are testing other letters? But we know E is in the secret word, so to get information about E\'s position, we should include it? Not necessarily, but including E helps us to find its position.\n\nIncluding E and R in the guess is efficient because we can test new positions.\n\nIf we skip E or R, we might get less information.\n\nSo prioritise words with both E and R.\n\nWords with R and E, no C,A,N, E not at end? Optional in guess, but as reasoned, better to avoid E at 5 for new guess.\n\nSome options:\n\n- ""SERVE"": S, E, R, V, E? Letters: E at pos1, R at pos3, and E at pos5? But E at 5: since we know E is not at 5 in secret word, if we guess E at 5, we\'ll get ""-"" meaning E is present but not at that position. But we have two E\'s? And in ""SERVE"", E is at position 1 and 5.\n\nBut the secret word might or might not have duplicates? But in our first guess, we had no duplicates, so we don\'t know if duplicates are possible.\n\nBut to avoid complications, guess words without duplicates for now.\n\nBetter single E.\n\nWord ""ROGUE"": R at 1, O at 2, G at 3, U at 4, E at 5. But E at 5: if we guess E at 5, and secret word E not at 5, we\'ll get ""-"". Also, U is less common.\n\nWord ""RIDES"": R at 1, I at 2, D at 3, E at 4, S at 5. E at position 4 (good, not 5), R at position 1 (good, not 2). Also, includes D and S, which are untested.\n\nSimilarly, ""TREES"": T, R, E, E, S? Duplicate E, and R at 2? Avoid R at 2.\n\n""DRIVE"": D at 1, R at 2? Avoid R at 2.\n\n""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E. Positions: R at position 2? Avoid position 2 for R.\n\nHow about ""SPIRE"": S, P, I, R, E? E at position 5? Avoid E at 5 if possible. Put E at position 5? We\'ll get ""-"", but we could.\n\nBut to conserve, better put E in 1-4.\n\nSo back to ""RIDES"": R at 1, I at 2, D at 3, E at 4, S at 5. \n- R position 1: If R is at position 1 for secret word, we get ✓, else ""-"".\n- E position 4: similar.\n- Also tests I,D,S.\n\nAnother option: ""ROPES"": R at 1, O at 2, P at 3, E at 4, S at 5. Similarly.\n\n""ROPES"" has O and P, which are common.\n\n""RIDES"": R, I, D, E, S.\n\nWe also have ""REUSE"": R at 1? But ""REUSE"" has two E\'s? Not ideal. ""REUSE"": R, E, U, S, E? E at position 2 and 5.\n\nAvoid.\n\nBetter ""RIDES"" or ""ROPES"", or ""TILES""? But TILES has T,I,L,E,S but no R? We must include R? Not mandatory for guess, but to test R, better include.\n\nWe know R is present, so including it can confirm position.\n\nOption: ""RETCH"" but C is out? We have C as absent, ""RETCH"" has C? No, C is invalid? ""RETCH"" has C? The word contains C? Yes, so avoid.\n\n""RESTS"": R, E, S, T, S? But R at position 1, E at position 2, S at 3 and 5? And T at 4? Good positions? E at 2: since E is present but not necessarily at 2. But we don\'t have any constraint on E position except not 5? And R not at 2. In ""RESTS"", R at 1 (okay), E at 2 (could be), and avoids E at 5.\n\nAlso, includes S and T, common letters.\n\nBut duplicate S? Not a problem necessarily.\n\nCompared to ""RIDES"": both have S at the end? ""RESTS"" ends with S, ""RIDES"" also ends with S.\n\nBut ""RESTS"" might be better because it also has T.\n\nBut E is at position 2 in ""RESTS"", while in ""RIDES"" E is at 4.\n\nWe don\'t know which positions E might be.\n\nNow, deciding between ""RESTS"" and ""RIDES"".\n\nPerhaps ""STREP"", but that ends with P? ""STREP"": S,T,R,E,P. E at 4? R at 3? Positions: position1=S,2=T,3=R,4=E,5=P? Then S,T,R,E,P.\n\nR is at position 3 (which is not 2, allowed), E at position 4 (not 5, avoided).\n\nAnd includes S,T,P.\n\nAlso, all unique letters? ""STREP"" has S,T,R,E,P — unique letters.\n\nGood candidate.\n\nBut ""STREP"" means a type of bacteria? Might be obscure. Is ""strep"" a valid common word? Not ideal.\n\nPerhaps ""STRIP"" but no E? Must have E? Not required, but E is in word? We should include E.\n\nThen ""SERVE"" as I thought earlier: S, E, R, V, E? E at 1 and 5? Duplicate E.\n\nBad.\n\n""VERSE"": V,E,R,S,E? Duplicate E.\n\n""GRIPE"": G,R,I,P,E? E at 5? We avoid E at 5.\n\nBut if we guess E at 5, we get ""-"" meaning E present but elsewhere.\n\nBut to save a position test, better not.\n\n""GRIME"": G,R,I,M,E? E at 5.\n\nSame.\n\n""BRIDE"": B,R,I,D,E? B might be good? But we have to avoid B? No, only C,A,N are out. B hasn\'t been tried.\n\nPositions: R at 2? Avoid R at 2. In ""BRIDE"", R is at 2? So position 2 for R? Bad.\n\nAvoid R at 2: so for words, R should be first, third, fourth, or last.\n\nPerhaps ""OREAD"": O,R,E,A,D? A is out? A is not allowed? We know A is not in word? Feedback said A(x), so absent, thus OREAD has A? Position 4? So invalid guess because A is out.\n\nThus avoid words containing A,C, or N.\n\nSo words must consist of letters not C,A,N.\n\nLetters available: B,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nBut with R and E included.\n\nAnother word: ""WISER"": W,I,S,E,R? Positions: R at last position? R at 5? Good. E at position 4? Okay. And W,I,S.\n\n""RIPER"": R,I,P,E,R? Duplicate R? Avoid.\n\nPerhaps ""DRIFT"": D,R,I,F,T? No E? Omit E.\n\nYes, we can omit E since we know E is present, and it might be tested in later guesses? But better to include now.\n\n""WRIST"": W,R,I,S,T? No E.\n\nBut E is known present, so guess should include E to find position.\n\nTherefore, going back, ""RIDES"" seems good: R in position 1, E in position 4, and I,D,S are new.\n\n""RIDES"" is a word? Yes, like horse rides.\n\nSimilarly, ""ROPES"" is also common.\n\n""ROPES"" has O, which is vowel.\n\nBut both options are fine.\n\nI think I choose ""RIDES"" for its commonality.\n\nBut ""RESTS"" might be more common? ""RESTS"" has duplicate S? But that\'s okay.\n\nAnother good one: ""STORE"" but E at 5? Avoid if possible.\n\nHow about ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E? But E at 5. No, E at 5 not desired. And no R? Omit R.\n\nMust include R? Not enforced, but we know R is present so exclude?\n\nIf we guess without R, we might get feedback that misses the R position? But we can infer.\n\nFor example, if we guess ""STOLE"", we might:\n- Get S, T, O, L, E feedback.\nBut E at 5, we know E is present but not at 5, so we\'ll get E(-).\nBut we also know R is present, but not in the guess, so the feedback won\'t tell us anything about R. Meaning, we won\'t test new positions for R.\n\nTo be efficient, better reuse known present letters R and E in new positions.\n\nTherefore, I decide to use ""RIDES"": R in position 1, I in position 2, D in position 3, E in position 4, S in position 5.\n\nSo, guess: RIDES\n\nStep-by-step reasoning: Since R is present but not at position 2, I place R at position 1 to test if it\'s there. E is present not at position 5, so I place at position 4. The word includes new letters I, D, S to gather more information.Based on the feedback from the first guess:\n- **C, A, N** are **not in the word**.\n- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2**.\n- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5**.\n\nFor the second guess, I need to include both **R and E** (since they exist in the word) but avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5. I also cannot use **C, A, or N**. Ideally, the new guess should test new positions for R and E and introduce common unused letters to gather more information.\n\nA strong candidate is **RIDES**:\n- **R** is placed in **position 1** (a possible correct position; previously not tested).\n- **E** is placed in **position 4** (avoiding position 5 and testing a new potential spot).\n- **I, D, S** are new letters (common consonants/vowels not yet tested).\n- Avoids all forbidden letters (no C, A, N) and aligns with constraints.\n\nThis should help narrow down the position of R and E while covering frequent English letters.\n\n<guess>RIDES</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: RIDES -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: CRANE\n- C: absent (x)\n- R: present but wrong position (-) [since it was in position 2, but not there]\n- A: absent (x)\n- N: absent (x)\n- E: present but wrong position (-) [position 5 is wrong]\n\nSecond guess: RIDES\n- R: present but wrong position (-) [we placed R at position 1, but it\'s not there]\n- I: absent (x)\n- D: absent (x)\n- E: correct position (✓) [we placed E at position 4, and it is correct!]\n- S: absent (x)\n\nSo, what do we know?\n1. The secret word has the letter E in position 4. (Great! So E is fixed at the 4th position.)\n2. The letter R is in the word, but it is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 1 (from second guess). So R must be in position 3 or 5? (Positions: 1,2,3,4,5; but position 4 is E, so R can be in 3 or 5.)\n3. The following letters are absent: C, A, N, I, D, S. (So we cannot use these letters.)\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we know E is present and not at position 5, which is consistent because now we know E is at 4.\n\nNow, the secret word has E at position 4, and R is present but not at 1 or 2. So R must be at position 3 or 5.\n\nAdditionally, we have no information about other letters. We have used: C, R, A, N, E, I, D, S. So absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S.\n\nAvailable letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we need to form a 5-letter word that has E at position 4 and R at either position 3 or 5.\n\nAlso, the word must include R (since it\'s present) and we know E is at 4.\n\nNow, for the third guess, we should try to determine the position of R and also test other letters.\n\nWe have two cases for R: position 3 or 5.\n\nWe can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we can only test one word.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has R in position 3 and then see, or in position 5.\n\nBut we also want to test other common letters.\n\nSince E is fixed at 4, the word pattern is: _ _ _ E _\n\nAnd R must be in the third or fifth position.\n\nSo possible patterns: \n- If R is at 3: _ _ R E _\n- If R is at 5: _ _ _ E R\n\nWe need to fill the other positions with new letters.\n\nWe should avoid the absent letters: C,A,N,I,D,S.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit these patterns.\n\nFirst, pattern: _ _ R E _\n\nPossible words: \n- With R at 3: e.g., ""CARE"" but C and A are out. Not possible.\n- ""BARE"" but A is out.\n- ""FIRE"" but I is out? I is absent? Yes, I is absent. So no.\n- ""MORE"": M, O, R, E, ? -> but E is at 4, so ""MORE"" would be M O R E, but we need 5 letters? ""MORE"" is 4 letters. We need 5-letter words.\n\n5-letter words with pattern _ _ R E _\n\nExamples:\n- ""STORE"" but S and T? S is absent, T is available? S is absent, so no.\n- ""CHORE"" but C and H? C is absent, so no.\n- ""WHORE"" but W,H,O,R,E? But O is available, but we have E at 4, so ""WHORE"" is W H O R E -> positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:O? No, we need R at position 3. ""WHORE"" has R at 4? W H O R E -> 1:W, 2:H, 3:O, 4:R, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, so position 4 must be E, but here it\'s R? Not matching.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be E, so for pattern _ _ R E _, it means:\nPosition 1: ?\nPosition 2: ?\nPosition 3: R\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: ?\n\nSimilarly, for pattern _ _ _ E R: \nPosition 1: ?\nPosition 2: ?\nPosition 3: ?\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: R\n\nNow, let\'s find words for pattern 1: _ _ R E _\n\nWith available letters: no C,A,N,I,D,S.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""PARER"" but P,A,R,E,R? A is absent, and duplicate R? Also, E at 4? ""PARER"": P A R E R -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:R, 4:E, 5:R -> but A is absent, so invalid.\n- ""MOVER"": M O V E R? But E is at 4? ""MOVER"": M O V E R -> 1:M, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R -> this is pattern _ _ _ E R, not _ _ R E _.\n\nFor pattern _ _ R E _:\n- ""BORED"": B O R E D -> but D is absent? D is absent, so no.\n- ""FOREX""? Not common word.\n- ""GORED"": G O R E D -> D absent.\n- ""HORDE"": H O R D E -> D absent, and E at 5? ""HORDE"" is H O R D E -> 1:H,2:O,3:R,4:D,5:E -> but we need E at 4, so position 4 is D? Not E. So no.\n\nIt seems hard to find a word for _ _ R E _ with the constraints.\n\nPerhaps ""MURRE"" or ""PURGE""? \n- ""PURGE"": P U R G E -> 1:P, 2:U, 3:R, 4:G, 5:E -> position 4 is G, not E. So no.\n\nWe need position 4 to be E, so for pattern _ _ R E _, it must have E at position 4? No: the pattern is _ _ R E _, meaning:\nPosition 1: letter\nPosition 2: letter\nPosition 3: R\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: letter\n\nBut in ""PURGE"", position 4 is G, not E.\n\nSo we need a word where position 4 is E and position 3 is R? But we are considering the case where R is at position 3.\n\nBut in the word, position 4 is fixed as E, so if R is at 3, then we have ... R E ...\n\nBut let\'s list words ending with ""RE"" but that\'s position 4 and 5? No.\n\nPerhaps it\'s easier to think of words that have E at position 4.\n\nSo the word must be: ? ? ? E ?\n\nAnd R must be at 3 or 5.\n\nCase 1: R at position 3: then word is ? ? R E ?\nCase 2: R at position 5: then word is ? ? ? E R\n\nNow, for case 1: ? ? R E ?\n\nWith available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding C,A,N,I,D,S)\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BORED"" -> B O R E D -> but D is absent, invalid.\n- ""FIRED"" -> F I R E D -> I and D absent.\n- ""HORDE"" -> H O R D E -> D absent, and E at 5? No, position 4 is D? H O R D E: pos4=D, pos5=E -> not E at 4.\n- ""LURED"" -> L U R E D -> D absent.\n- ""MURKY"" -> M U R K Y -> no E at 4? Position 4 is K, not E.\n- ""PUREE"" -> P U R E E -> but E at 4 and 5? ""PUREE"": P U R E E -> pos1:P,2:U,3:R,4:E,5:E -> this fits: ? ? R E ? with ? at 1,2,5 being P,U,E? But E at 5 is duplicate? And E is at 4 and 5.\n\nBut the secret word has E at position 4, but it might have another E? We don\'t know. But in our first guess, we had E and it was not at 5, but now we know E is at 4, so position 5 could be E? But the feedback for first guess E(-) at position 5 means that E is not at 5, so the secret word does not have E at position 5. Therefore, position 5 cannot be E. So ""PUREE"" has E at 5, which would be invalid for secret word? But we are guessing, so we can guess it, but it would be inconsistent with what we know? No, we can guess it, but we know that if we guess E at 5, it will be marked absent (since E is not at 5) or if the word has duplicate E? But we don\'t know if duplicate E is possible.\n\nBut from first guess, E was not at 5, but it could be at 4 and also at 5? No, because if E were at 5, the first guess would have shown E as correct or wrong position? In first guess, we had E at position 5, and it was marked (-) meaning present but wrong position. That means E is in the word but not at position 5. So if E were also at position 4, it would still be marked present but not at 5. But the feedback doesn\'t tell us about position 4. So it\'s possible that E is at 4 and not at 5, and no duplicate.\n\nBut in ""PUREE"", we have E at 4 and 5, but we know E is not at 5, so for secret word, position 5 cannot be E. Therefore, ""PUREE"" as a guess is okay, but it has E at 5 which we know is wrong, so it will be marked as present but wrong position? But E is already at 4, which is correct, so position 5 E would be marked as absent? Let\'s think about feedback rules.\n\nIf the secret word has only one E, and we guess two E\'s, then:\n- If we guess E at position 4 and it is correct, it gets ✓.\n- If we guess E at position 5 and the secret word has no E at 5, it should be marked x (absent) if there is no second E? But the feedback for duplicate letters: typically in Wordle, if the letter appears once, and you guess it twice, the second one might be marked x if not present.\n\nStandard Wordle rules: for duplicate letters, if the secret has one E, and you guess two E\'s, the first one in correct position gets ✓, and the second one in wrong position gets x (because there\'s no extra E). Or if the first one is in wrong position, it gets -, and the second one might get x.\n\nBut in this case, for ""PUREE"" as a guess:\n- Position 4: E is correct, so ✓.\n- Position 5: E is not in the secret word (since only one E at position 4), so it should be x.\n\nBut we are trying to guess, so it\'s acceptable, but it wastes a letter.\n\nTo avoid confusion, better to avoid duplicate letters in guess.\n\nSo back to finding words.\n\nFor case 1: ? ? R E ? with no C,A,N,I,D,S and no duplicate.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""FOREMAN"" too long.\n- 5-letter: ""FOREM"" not a word.\n- ""GORED"" invalid.\n- ""HOVER"" H O V E R -> but this is ? ? ? E R, not ? ? R E ?.\n\n""BORNE"" but B O R N E -> N is absent.\n\n""PURGE"" P U R G E -> positions: 1:P,2:U,3:R,4:G,5:E -> but position 4 is G, not E. We need position 4 to be E, so this has E at 5.\n\nI think I\'m confusing the pattern.\n\nFor case 1, we want R at position 3 and E at position 4, so the word must have letter3=R and letter4=E.\n\nSo words like X X R E X.\n\nExamples:\n- ""BREAD"" but B R E A D -> position 3 is E, not R? ""BREAD"": B at1, R at2, E at3, A at4, D at5 -> not matching.\n- ""TREND"" T R E N D -> position 3 is E, not R.\n- ""CREST"" C R E S T -> C and S absent, and position 3 is E.\n\nWe need position 3=R and position 4=E.\n\n""FREED"" F R E E D -> duplicate E, and D absent.\n""GREET"" G R E E T -> duplicate E.\n""PREXY"" not a word.\n""TREYF"" not a word.\n\nIt\'s difficult. Perhaps there are no common words with R at 3 and E at 4 with the available letters.\n\nLet\'s try case 2: R at position 5, so pattern ? ? ? E R\n\nThen the word is letter1, letter2, letter3, E, R.\n\nWith available letters.\n\nExamples:\n- ""LATER"" but A is absent.\n- ""METER"" M E T E R -> duplicate E, and position 4 is E? ""METER"": M at1, E at2, T at3, E at4, R at5 -> but we need position 4 to be E, which it is, and position 5=R. But it has E at2 and E at4, so duplicate E. Also, E at2 is new? But we know E is at4, so E at2 might be absent or wrong position.\n\nBut duplicate.\n\n""POWER"" P O W E R -> positions: P at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5 -> perfect! No duplicate, and letters P,O,W are available.\n\n""POWER"" is a valid word.\n\nOther options:\n- ""TOWER"" T O W E R -> similar, T available.\n- ""MOWER"" M O W E R -> M available.\n- ""COVER"" but C absent.\n- ""HOVER"" H O V E R -> H and V available.\n- ""LOVER"" L O V E R -> L and V.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, we also have the possibility that R is at position 3, but we couldn\'t find a word, so maybe it\'s not likely? Or we missed a word.\n\nAnother word for case 1: ""BOREE"" not common.\n""FORZE"" not word.\n\nPerhaps ""QUREK"" not word.\n\nSo probably, the secret word is more likely to have R at position 5.\n\nFor the third guess, we can guess a word that has R at position 5 and E at position 4, and test other positions.\n\nFor example, ""POWER"": tests P at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.\n\nIf we guess this, and if R is indeed at position 5, we might get R(✓), and E(✓), and information about P,O,W.\n\nIf R is not at 5, then we will get R(-) for position 5, meaning R is present but not at 5, so it must be at position 3 (since positions 1 and 2 are ruled out).\n\nBut in that case, we would have to use a different word.\n\nBut with ""POWER"", we cover the case for R at 5 and also test three new letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""TOWER"" or ""MOWER"" are also good.\n\nI think ""POWER"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can include more common letters.\n\nAvailable common letters: O, T, L, etc.\n\n""LOWER"": L O W E R -> L at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.\n\n""TOWER"": T O W E R.\n\nAll similar.\n\nI\'ll go with ""POWER"".\n\nBut we have to make sure we don\'t use absent letters.\n\nP, O, W, E, R: E and R are known, P,O,W not used before.\n\nSo guess ""POWER"".\n\nBut in the feedback, we might get:\n\n- If R is at 5, then R(✓)\n- E is at 4, so E(✓)\n- Then P, O, W will be checked.\n\nIf R is not at 5, then R(-) meaning R is present but not at 5, so it must be at 3.\n\nAnd then we know.\n\nAlso, if any of P,O,W are in the word, we get feedback.\n\nSo it\'s a good guess.\n\nTherefore, third guess: POWER\n\nStep-by-step:\n\n- E is confirmed at position 4.\n- R is present but not at position 1 or 2, so must be at 3 or 5.\n- To test R at position 5 and introduce new common letters, guess ""POWER"" which places R at 5 and E at 4.\n- This will either confirm R at position 5 or reveal that R must be at position 3 (if R is marked as present but wrong position at 5).\n- Also tests P, O, W in positions 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<guess>POWER</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **E is confirmed at position 4** (from Guess 2: E(✓)).\n- **R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2** (from Guess 1: R(-) at position 2; Guess 2: R(-) at position 1). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 5.\n- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, I, D, S (marked ""x"" in feedback).\n- **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nFor the third guess, I need to:\n- Test the position of R (position 3 or 5).\n- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.\n- Keep E fixed at position 4.\n\nA strong guess is **POWER**:\n- **P, O, W** are new, common letters not yet tested.\n- **E** is placed at position 4 (confirmed correct).\n- **R** is placed at position 5 (testing if R is at position 5; if not, it must be at position 3).\n- Avoids all absent letters (C, A, N, I, D, S).\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down R\'s position while covering frequent English letters.\n\n<guess>POWER</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: RIDES -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: POWER -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: absent (x)\n- R: present, wrong position (-) [position 2]\n- A: absent (x)\n- N: absent (x)\n- E: present, wrong position (-) [position 5]\n\nGuess 2: RIDES\n- R: present, wrong position (-) [position 1]\n- I: absent (x)\n- D: absent (x)\n- E: correct position (✓) [position 4]\n- S: absent (x)\n\nGuess 3: POWER\n- P: absent (x)\n- O: correct position (✓) [position 2]\n- W: absent (x)\n- E: correct position (✓) [position 4]\n- R: correct position (✓) [position 5]\n\nNow, let\'s consolidate what we know:\n\n1. **Correct positions:**\n   - Position 2: O (from POWER: O(✓))\n   - Position 4: E (from RIDES: E(✓) and confirmed in POWER)\n   - Position 5: R (from POWER: R(✓))\n\n2. **Absent letters:** C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W (all marked x in guesses)\n\n3. **Present letters with known positions:**\n   - O at position 2, E at position 4, R at position 5.\n\n4. **Other present letters:**\n   - From Guess 1, R was present but not at position 2, and now we know it\'s at position 5.\n   - E was present but not at position 5, and now we know it\'s at position 4.\n\n5. **Letters not yet tested:** We have used C, R, A, N, E, I, D, S, P, O, W.

We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: absent (x)
- R: present, wrong position (-) [position 2]
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (-) [position 5]

Guess 2: RIDES
- R: present, wrong position (-) [position 1]
- I: absent (x)
- D: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) [position 4]
- S: absent (x)

Guess 3: POWER
- P: absent (x)
- O: correct position (✓) [position 2]
- W: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) [position 4]
- R: correct position (✓) [position 5]

Guess 4: LOVER
- L: absent (x)
- O: correct position (✓) [position 2]
- V: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) [position 4]
- R: correct position (✓) [position 5]

Now, we know:
- The secret word has O at position 2, E at position 4, and R at position 5. So the pattern is: _ O _ E R
- Absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W, L, V (all marked x in guesses)
- Therefore, available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, X, Y, Z (since C,A,N,I,D,S,P,W,L,V are out)

We need to find the first and third letters from the available set.

The secret word is: [letter1] O [letter3] E R

We must choose a word that fits this pattern, using only the available letters.

Possible words:
- ""HOMER"": H O M E R -> H and M are available? H not tried, M not tried. But ""HOMER"" is a valid word.
- ""BOXER"": B O X E R -> B and X available.
- ""FOYER"": F O Y E R -> F and Y available.
- ""JOKER"": J O K E R -> J and K available.
- ""TOWER"": but W is absent, so no.
- ""MOVER"": M O V E R -> but V is absent (from LOVER: V(x)), so invalid.
- ""ROVER"": R O V E R -> V absent and duplicate R? Not good.

Other possibilities: ""BAKER"" but A absent, ""MAKER"" A absent, etc.

With available letters, let's list possible words:

- ""HOMER"": H at1, M at3
- ""BOXER"": B at1, X at3
- ""FOYER"": F at1, Y at3
- ""JOKER"": J at1, K at3
- ""TOPER"": T O P E R -> but P is absent (from POWER: P(x)), so invalid.
- ""GOFER"": G O F E R -> G and F available? ""GOFER"" is a word? Yes, meaning an employee who runs errands. G at1, F at3.
- ""HOVER"" but V absent.
- ""MOWER"" W absent.

Also, ""COMET"" but pattern not match.

So possible: ""HOMER"", ""BOXER"", ""FOYER"", ""JOKER"", ""GOFER"".

We need to guess one that might be the word or get information.

But since we have only two positions, and we know the pattern, we can guess one that uses common letters.

Common letters left: T, but no word with T? ""TOKER"" not common, ""TOTER"" T O T E R -> duplicate T? And T available.

""TOTER"" is a word, meaning one who carries. T at1, T at3? Duplicate.

But we can consider.

Similarly, ""HOMER"" is quite common.

Since we have multiple options, we should choose a word that tests letters that cover more possibilities.

But we have no prior on which letters are more likely, so any is fine.

Perhaps ""HOMER"" is a good choice.

But let's see the feedback: in LOVER, L and V are absent, so we have more absent letters.

Now, for the fifth guess, we can guess ""HOMER"".

If it's not, we get feedback on H and M.

But we have only 6 guesses, and this is guess 5.

We have two positions, so we might need two guesses, but we have two left.

After this guess, we might solve or have one more.

But let's guess ""HOMER"".

If correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback on H and M.

For example, if H is absent, then we know position 1 is not H, and similarly for M.

Then we can guess another word like ""BOXER"" or ""FOYER"".

But to save a guess, if we can.

But we don't know.

Another idea: is there a word that uses more than one possible letter? No, because we have to fill specific positions.

We could guess a word that has a different letter at position 1 and 3 to test both.

But all options do that.

I think ""HOMER"" is a reasonable guess.

Perhaps ""TOWER"" but W absent, no.

""BOWER"" W absent.

So I'll go with ""HOMER"".

But let's confirm: H and M are available, not absent.

So guess ""HOMER"".

Therefore, fifth guess: HOMER

Step-by-step:
- Secret word pattern: _ O _ E R
- Absent letters: C,A,N,I,D,S,P,W,L,V
- Available: B,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,T,U,X,Y,Z
- ""HOMER"" fits: H at position 1, M at position 3, with O,E,R fixed.
- If correct, solved. If not, feedback on H and M will help for the final guess.

</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Current Word Pattern from Feedback**:
   - Position 2: **O** (confirmed correct in Guess 3 and 4).
   - Position 4: **E** (confirmed correct in Guess 2, 3, and 4).
   - Position 5: **R** (confirmed correct in Guess 3 and 4).
   - The secret word pattern is: **? O ? E R** (unknown first and third positions).

2. **Absent Letters**:
   - From all feedback: **C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W, L, V** are absent (marked ""x"" in guesses).
   - Available letters: **B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, X, Y, Z**.

3. **Previous Guess Analysis**:
   - Guess 4 (LOVER) eliminated **L** and **V**, confirming **O, E, R** positions.
   - Only positions 1 and 3 remain unknown, with limited letters left.

4. **Possible Words**:
   - With the pattern **? O ? E R** and available letters, common English words include:
     - **HOMER**: H at position 1, M at position 3.
     - **BOXER**: B at position 1, X at position 3.
     - **FOYER**: F at position 1, Y at position 3.
     - **JOKER**: J at position 1, K at position 3.
     - **GOFER**: G at position 1, F at position 3.
     - **TOTER**: T at position 1, T at position 3 (duplicate T, but valid).

5. **Strategy for Guess 5**:
   - **HOMER** is chosen because:
     - **H** and **M** are high-frequency consonants not yet tested.
     - It tests two new letters at once, maximizing information if incorrect.
     - If correct, the game is solved. If not, feedback on **H** and **M** (absent or position) will pinpoint the solution with the final guess.
   - Other options like BOXER or FOYER are less common, and TOTER has a duplicate letter, which is less likely.

6. **Risk Consideration**:
   - With only 2 guesses left (this is Guess 5), **HOMER** is efficient—it either wins or provides clear feedback for Guess 6.
   - If **H** or **M** is absent, we eliminate them and focus on other options (e.g., BOXER, FOYER) next.

- S: absent (x)

Guess 3: POWER
- P: absent (x)
- O: correct position (✓) [position 2]
- W: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) [position 4]
- R: correct position (✓) [position 5]

Guess 4: LOVER
- L: absent (x)
- O: correct position (✓) [position 2]
- V: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) [position 4]
- R: correct position (✓) [position 5]

Now, we know:
- The secret word has O at position 2, E at position 4, and R at position 5. So the pattern is: _ O _ E R
- Absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W, L, V (all marked x in guesses)
- Therefore, available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, X, Y, Z (since C,A,N,I,D,S,P,W,L,V are out)

We need to find the first and third letters from the available set.

The secret word is: [letter1] O [letter3] E R

We must choose a word that fits this pattern, using only the available letters.

Possible words:
- ""HOMER"": H O M E R -> H and M are available? H not tried, M not tried. But ""HOMER"" is a valid word.
- ""BOXER"": B O X E R -> B and X available.
- ""FOYER"": F O Y E R -> F and Y available.
- ""JOKER"": J O K E R -> J and K available.
- ""TOWER"": but W is absent, so no.
- ""MOVER"": M O V E R -> but V is absent (from LOVER: V(x)), so invalid.
- ""ROVER"": R O V E R -> V absent and duplicate R? Not good.

Other possibilities: ""BAKER"" but A absent, ""MAKER"" A absent, etc.

With available letters, let's list possible words:

- ""HOMER"": H at1, M at3
- ""BOXER"": B at1, X at3
- ""FOYER"": F at1, Y at3
- ""JOKER"": J at1, K at3
- ""TOPER"": T O P E R -> but P is absent (from POWER: P(x)), so invalid.
- ""GOFER"": G O F E R -> G and F available? ""GOFER"" is a word? Yes, meaning an employee who runs errands. G at1, F at3.
- ""HOVER"" but V absent.
- ""MOWER"" W absent.

Also, ""COMET"" but pattern not match.

So possible: ""HOMER"", ""BOXER"", ""FOYER"", ""JOKER"", ""GOFER"".

We need to guess one that might be the word or get information.

But since we have only two positions, and we know the pattern, we can guess one that uses common letters.

Common letters left: T, but no word with T? ""TOKER"" not common, ""TOTER"" T O T E R -> duplicate T? And T available.

""TOTER"" is a word, meaning one who carries. T at1, T at3? Duplicate.

But we can consider.

Similarly, ""HOMER"" is quite common.

Since we have multiple options, we should choose a word that tests letters that cover more possibilities.

But we have no prior on which letters are more likely, so any is fine.

Perhaps ""HOMER"" is a good choice.

But let's see the feedback: in LOVER, L and V are absent, so we have more absent letters.

Now, for the fifth guess, we can guess ""HOMER"".

If it's not, we get feedback on H and M.

But we have only 6 guesses, and this is guess 5.

We have two positions, so we might need two guesses, but we have two left.

After this guess, we might solve or have one more.

But let's guess ""HOMER"".

If correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback on H and M.

For example, if H is absent, then we know position 1 is not H, and similarly for M.

Then we can guess another word like ""BOXER"" or ""FOYER"".

But to save a guess, if we can.

But we don't know.

Another idea: is there a word that uses more than one possible letter? No, because we have to fill specific positions.

We could guess a word that has a different letter at position 1 and 3 to test both.

But all options do that.

I think ""HOMER"" is a reasonable guess.

Perhaps ""TOWER"" but W absent, no.

""BOWER"" W absent.

So I'll go with ""HOMER"".

But let's confirm: H and M are available, not absent.

So guess ""HOMER"".

Therefore, fifth guess: HOMER

Step-by-step:
- Secret word pattern: _ O _ E R
- Absent letters: C,A,N,I,D,S,P,W,L,V
- Available: B,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,T,U,X,Y,Z
- ""HOMER"" fits: H at position 1, M at position 3, with O,E,R fixed.
- If correct, solved. If not, feedback on H and M will help for the final guess.

<guess>HOMER</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Current Word Pattern from Feedback**:
   - Position 2: **O** (confirmed correct in Guess 3 and 4).
   - Position 4: **E** (confirmed correct in Guess 2, 3, and 4).
   - Position 5: **R** (confirmed correct in Guess 3 and 4).
   - The secret word pattern is: **? O ? E R** (unknown first and third positions).

2. **Absent Letters**:
   - From all feedback: **C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W, L, V** are absent (marked ""x"" in guesses).
   - Available letters: **B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, X, Y, Z**.

3. **Previous Guess Analysis**:
   - Guess 4 (LOVER) eliminated **L** and **V**, confirming **O, E, R** positions.
   - Only positions 1 and 3 remain unknown, with limited letters left.

4. **Possible Words**:
   - With the pattern **? O ? E R** and available letters, common English words include:
     - **HOMER**: H at position 1, M at position 3.
     - **BOXER**: B at position 1, X at position 3.
     - **FOYER**: F at position 1, Y at position 3.
     - **JOKER**: J at position 1, K at position 3.
     - **GOFER**: G at position 1, F at position 3.
     - **TOTER**: T at position 1, T at position 3 (duplicate T, but valid).

5. **Strategy for Guess 5**:
   - **HOMER** is chosen because:
     - **H** and **M** are high-frequency consonants not yet tested.
     - It tests two new letters at once, maximizing information if incorrect.
     - If correct, the game is solved. If not, feedback on **H** and **M** (absent or position) will pinpoint the solution with the final guess.
   - Other options like BOXER or FOYER are less common, and TOTER has a duplicate letter, which is less likely.

6. **Risk Consideration**:
   - With only 2 guesses left (this is Guess 5), **HOMER** is efficient—it either wins or provides clear feedback for Guess 6.
   - If **H** or **M** is absent, we eliminate them and focus on other options (e.g., BOXER, FOYER) next.",Guess 5: HOMER -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) M(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We can choose a word that covers frequent letters.

 Let's consider the frequency of letters in 5-letter English words. The most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc.

 A popular starting word is ""ROATE"" (which means the cumulative return from investments) but it's not very common. 
 Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is a good one because it has two vowels (A, I) and three common consonants (R, S, E).

 But note: the feedback symbols are case-sensitive? The example used uppercase. However, the rules don't specify. 
 We'll assume the game is case-insensitive for the word, but we'll output in uppercase as in the example.

 Another good starting word is ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E — all common letters.

 I think I'll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 However, let me check if ""CRANE"" is a valid 5-letter word. Yes, it is.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".I am starting the game and need to make my first guess. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word with common letters to maximize information. The most frequent letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, and N. A strong starting word should include several of these. ""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because it contains C (common consonant), R (2nd most common consonant), A (common vowel), N (common consonant), and E (most common vowel). This combination covers frequent letters and positions, helping me gather useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Interpretation:
- C is not in the word at all.
- R is in the word but not in the second position (where we guessed it).
- A is not in the word at all.
- N is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

So, we know:
- The word contains R and E, but not in the positions we guessed.
- The word does NOT contain C, A, N.

Since R is in the word but not in position 2, and E is in the word but not in position 5, and our guess had R in position 2 and E in position 5, they must be elsewhere.

Now, we need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word without C, A, N, and including R and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively? Actually, the position constraints: 
- R cannot be in position 2 (because feedback was R(-), meaning it's present but wrong position).
- E cannot be in position 5.

Moreover, since the word has R and E, and no C, A, N, we can list possible letters.

We also note that the word might have other letters. Since A and C are out, we should avoid vowels that are less common? We have E, so we focus on common consonants and vowels.

Common remaining letters: E, R, and others like O, I, T, S, L, etc.

But we know R is in the word, so we must include R. Similarly, E must be included.

In the new guess, we should place R in a position that is not 2, and E in a position that is not 5. Also, avoid positions 1,3,4 for R and E? Wait, the feedback doesn't say anything about positions 1,3,4 being correct or not for R and E? Actually:

- For R: only position 2 is wrong, so it could be in position 1,3,4, or even 5? But position 5 might be taken by E? Actually, E cannot be in position 5 in the secret word, so E must be in positions 1-4.

Similarly, R must be in positions 1,3,4, or 5? But we don't know about position 5 for R. Since E is in the word and not in position 5, R could be in position 5? Yes.

So constraints:
- The word must include R and E.
- R not in position 2.
- E not in position 5.
- No C, A, N.

Now, our goal is to guess a word that respects these constraints and uses common letters to test other positions.

We should also try to get information about other letters. Since E is in the word, let's think about possible positions.

Possible positions for E: since not at 5, it must be at 1,2,3, or 4.
Similarly for R: not at 2, so at 1,3,4,5.

We should avoid placing E in position 5 (already forbidden) and R in position 2.

But in our new guess, we can put E and R in any positions we want, remembering the feedback rules.

What word to choose? Let's think of common words with R and E, and without C, A, N.

Also, the word should not reuse letters that are already known absent: C, A, N.

We have already used C, R, A, N, E. From this, we know E and R are present, so we should reuse E and R in the new guess? But note: in Wordle-like games, reusing letters that are present is good to find their positions.

So, we must include R and E in our new guess.

We need a word that contains R and E, not containing C, A, N.

Possible words: 
- Words like ""ROBES"", ""STORE"", ""GUIDE"" (but GUIDEs has D and U, and E at end? We know E not at end? No, E not at position 5, so in STORE E is at 5, which is forbidden? Yes, so avoid words ending with E.

In the secret word, E cannot be at position 5, but in our guess, we can put E at any position? Yes, because we are testing. However, if we put E at position 5, we expect it to be marked x or -, but we know in the secret word E is not at position 5, so if we put E at 5, it will be wrong position? Actually, feedback: if we put E at 5, and E is in the word elsewhere, it will show -. If E is not at 5, and we guess E at 5, it will be wrong position only if E is present? Yes.

But to avoid wasting the E test, we should put E in a position where it might be correct, i.e., positions 1-4.

Similarly for R, avoid position 2.

So, good choices: put R in position 1,3,4, or 5; and E in position 1,2,3, or 4.

Now, what about the other letters? We need new letters to test.

Possible candidates:

- Words beginning with R: e.g., ""RESTS"", but S in it. But we don't know anything about S. However, ""RESTS"" has E at position 2 and R at 1, which we can test.

But ""RESTS"" has T and S, common letters.

But also, we want to use letters not yet tried? Yes, to get more information.

Letters tried so far: C, R, A, N, E. So we haven't tried S, T, O, I, L, etc.

Good words: ""RISES"" has I and S. But A is forbidden? Yes, but no A. However, ""RISES"" has R at 1, I at 2, S at 3, E at 4, S at 5. Position: E at 4, and R at 1 (which is not position 2). Good. And no C,A,N.

But in the secret word, E is present but not at position 5? Here E is at 4.

Possibly.

Word ""ROLES"": R at 1, O at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5. E at 4 (which is allowed for secret word), R at 1 (not position 2). Good.

But we need to see which one is better.

Another word: ""TRIES"" - T, R, I, E, S. Positions: R at 2? But R cannot be at position 2 because the feedback for our first guess told us R is not in position 2. So if we put R at position 2, it will be wrong again? No, the secret word has R, but not at position 2. So in a new position, we must avoid putting R at position 2 because we know it's not there.

In ""TRIES"": T position 1, R position 2. But R at position 2 in the guess would trigger a ""-"" because R is present but not in position 2. But we are not learning new? We are confirming that position 2 is wrong for R. But since we already know that, it's redundant.

To maximize new information, we should place R in a position where it might be correct, i.e., positions 1,3,4,5.

For example, ""TRIES"" with R at position 2 is inefficient because it re-tests position 2.

Better to put R at a new position.

Similarly for E, avoid position 5? But E at position 5: we know in secret word E is not at 5, so if we guess E at 5, we'll just get a ""-"" which tells us E is elsewhere, but we already know E is present. So it wastes a chance to pinpoint E's position? Yes.

Therefore, best to put E in one of positions 1-4 to see if that position is correct.

Similarly for R, put in positions 1,3,4,5 (avoiding 2).

Now, let's list possible words.

Option 1: ""PORTS"" - has P,O,R,T,S. But E is required? We must include E because we know E is in the word. If we don't include E, and E is in the word, we may miss it? But the word must contain E? No, our guess doesn't have to include E if we are testing other letters? But we know E is in the secret word, so to get information about E's position, we should include it? Not necessarily, but including E helps us to find its position.

Including E and R in the guess is efficient because we can test new positions.

If we skip E or R, we might get less information.

So prioritise words with both E and R.

Words with R and E, no C,A,N, E not at end? Optional in guess, but as reasoned, better to avoid E at 5 for new guess.

Some options:

- ""SERVE"": S, E, R, V, E? Letters: E at pos1, R at pos3, and E at pos5? But E at 5: since we know E is not at 5 in secret word, if we guess E at 5, we'll get ""-"" meaning E is present but not at that position. But we have two E's? And in ""SERVE"", E is at position 1 and 5.

But the secret word might or might not have duplicates? But in our first guess, we had no duplicates, so we don't know if duplicates are possible.

But to avoid complications, guess words without duplicates for now.

Better single E.

Word ""ROGUE"": R at 1, O at 2, G at 3, U at 4, E at 5. But E at 5: if we guess E at 5, and secret word E not at 5, we'll get ""-"". Also, U is less common.

Word ""RIDES"": R at 1, I at 2, D at 3, E at 4, S at 5. E at position 4 (good, not 5), R at position 1 (good, not 2). Also, includes D and S, which are untested.

Similarly, ""TREES"": T, R, E, E, S? Duplicate E, and R at 2? Avoid R at 2.

""DRIVE"": D at 1, R at 2? Avoid R at 2.

""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E. Positions: R at position 2? Avoid position 2 for R.

How about ""SPIRE"": S, P, I, R, E? E at position 5? Avoid E at 5 if possible. Put E at position 5? We'll get ""-"", but we could.

But to conserve, better put E in 1-4.

So back to ""RIDES"": R at 1, I at 2, D at 3, E at 4, S at 5. 
- R position 1: If R is at position 1 for secret word, we get ✓, else ""-"".
- E position 4: similar.
- Also tests I,D,S.

Another option: ""ROPES"": R at 1, O at 2, P at 3, E at 4, S at 5. Similarly.

""ROPES"" has O and P, which are common.

""RIDES"": R, I, D, E, S.

We also have ""REUSE"": R at 1? But ""REUSE"" has two E's? Not ideal. ""REUSE"": R, E, U, S, E? E at position 2 and 5.

Avoid.

Better ""RIDES"" or ""ROPES"", or ""TILES""? But TILES has T,I,L,E,S but no R? We must include R? Not mandatory for guess, but to test R, better include.

We know R is present, so including it can confirm position.

Option: ""RETCH"" but C is out? We have C as absent, ""RETCH"" has C? No, C is invalid? ""RETCH"" has C? The word contains C? Yes, so avoid.

""RESTS"": R, E, S, T, S? But R at position 1, E at position 2, S at 3 and 5? And T at 4? Good positions? E at 2: since E is present but not necessarily at 2. But we don't have any constraint on E position except not 5? And R not at 2. In ""RESTS"", R at 1 (okay), E at 2 (could be), and avoids E at 5.

Also, includes S and T, common letters.

But duplicate S? Not a problem necessarily.

Compared to ""RIDES"": both have S at the end? ""RESTS"" ends with S, ""RIDES"" also ends with S.

But ""RESTS"" might be better because it also has T.

But E is at position 2 in ""RESTS"", while in ""RIDES"" E is at 4.

We don't know which positions E might be.

Now, deciding between ""RESTS"" and ""RIDES"".

Perhaps ""STREP"", but that ends with P? ""STREP"": S,T,R,E,P. E at 4? R at 3? Positions: position1=S,2=T,3=R,4=E,5=P? Then S,T,R,E,P.

R is at position 3 (which is not 2, allowed), E at position 4 (not 5, avoided).

And includes S,T,P.

Also, all unique letters? ""STREP"" has S,T,R,E,P — unique letters.

Good candidate.

But ""STREP"" means a type of bacteria? Might be obscure. Is ""strep"" a valid common word? Not ideal.

Perhaps ""STRIP"" but no E? Must have E? Not required, but E is in word? We should include E.

Then ""SERVE"" as I thought earlier: S, E, R, V, E? E at 1 and 5? Duplicate E.

Bad.

""VERSE"": V,E,R,S,E? Duplicate E.

""GRIPE"": G,R,I,P,E? E at 5? We avoid E at 5.

But if we guess E at 5, we get ""-"" meaning E present but elsewhere.

But to save a position test, better not.

""GRIME"": G,R,I,M,E? E at 5.

Same.

""BRIDE"": B,R,I,D,E? B might be good? But we have to avoid B? No, only C,A,N are out. B hasn't been tried.

Positions: R at 2? Avoid R at 2. In ""BRIDE"", R is at 2? So position 2 for R? Bad.

Avoid R at 2: so for words, R should be first, third, fourth, or last.

Perhaps ""OREAD"": O,R,E,A,D? A is out? A is not allowed? We know A is not in word? Feedback said A(x), so absent, thus OREAD has A? Position 4? So invalid guess because A is out.

Thus avoid words containing A,C, or N.

So words must consist of letters not C,A,N.

Letters available: B,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But with R and E included.

Another word: ""WISER"": W,I,S,E,R? Positions: R at last position? R at 5? Good. E at position 4? Okay. And W,I,S.

""RIPER"": R,I,P,E,R? Duplicate R? Avoid.

Perhaps ""DRIFT"": D,R,I,F,T? No E? Omit E.

Yes, we can omit E since we know E is present, and it might be tested in later guesses? But better to include now.

""WRIST"": W,R,I,S,T? No E.

But E is known present, so guess should include E to find position.

Therefore, going back, ""RIDES"" seems good: R in position 1, E in position 4, and I,D,S are new.

""RIDES"" is a word? Yes, like horse rides.

Similarly, ""ROPES"" is also common.

""ROPES"" has O, which is vowel.

But both options are fine.

I think I choose ""RIDES"" for its commonality.

But ""RESTS"" might be more common? ""RESTS"" has duplicate S? But that's okay.

Another good one: ""STORE"" but E at 5? Avoid if possible.

How about ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E? But E at 5. No, E at 5 not desired. And no R? Omit R.

Must include R? Not enforced, but we know R is present so exclude?

If we guess without R, we might get feedback that misses the R position? But we can infer.

For example, if we guess ""STOLE"", we might:
- Get S, T, O, L, E feedback.
But E at 5, we know E is present but not at 5, so we'll get E(-).
But we also know R is present, but not in the guess, so the feedback won't tell us anything about R. Meaning, we won't test new positions for R.

To be efficient, better reuse known present letters R and E in new positions.

Therefore, I decide to use ""RIDES"": R in position 1, I in position 2, D in position 3, E in position 4, S in position 5.

So, guess: RIDES

Step-by-step reasoning: Since R is present but not at position 2, I place R at position 1 to test if it's there. E is present not at position 5, so I place at position 4. The word includes new letters I, D, S to gather more information.Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- **C, A, N** are **not in the word**.
- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2**.
- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the second guess, I need to include both **R and E** (since they exist in the word) but avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5. I also cannot use **C, A, or N**. Ideally, the new guess should test new positions for R and E and introduce common unused letters to gather more information.

A strong candidate is **RIDES**:
- **R** is placed in **position 1** (a possible correct position; previously not tested).
- **E** is placed in **position 4** (avoiding position 5 and testing a new potential spot).
- **I, D, S** are new letters (common consonants/vowels not yet tested).
- Avoids all forbidden letters (no C, A, N) and aligns with constraints.

This should help narrow down the position of R and E while covering frequent English letters.

<guess>RIDES</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: RIDES -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: CRANE
- C: absent (x)
- R: present but wrong position (-) [since it was in position 2, but not there]
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-) [position 5 is wrong]

Second guess: RIDES
- R: present but wrong position (-) [we placed R at position 1, but it's not there]
- I: absent (x)
- D: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) [we placed E at position 4, and it is correct!]
- S: absent (x)

So, what do we know?
1. The secret word has the letter E in position 4. (Great! So E is fixed at the 4th position.)
2. The letter R is in the word, but it is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 1 (from second guess). So R must be in position 3 or 5? (Positions: 1,2,3,4,5; but position 4 is E, so R can be in 3 or 5.)
3. The following letters are absent: C, A, N, I, D, S. (So we cannot use these letters.)

Also, from the first guess, we know E is present and not at position 5, which is consistent because now we know E is at 4.

Now, the secret word has E at position 4, and R is present but not at 1 or 2. So R must be at position 3 or 5.

Additionally, we have no information about other letters. We have used: C, R, A, N, E, I, D, S. So absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need to form a 5-letter word that has E at position 4 and R at either position 3 or 5.

Also, the word must include R (since it's present) and we know E is at 4.

Now, for the third guess, we should try to determine the position of R and also test other letters.

We have two cases for R: position 3 or 5.

We can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we can only test one word.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R in position 3 and then see, or in position 5.

But we also want to test other common letters.

Since E is fixed at 4, the word pattern is: _ _ _ E _

And R must be in the third or fifth position.

So possible patterns: 
- If R is at 3: _ _ R E _
- If R is at 5: _ _ _ E R

We need to fill the other positions with new letters.

We should avoid the absent letters: C,A,N,I,D,S.

Let's think of words that fit these patterns.

First, pattern: _ _ R E _

Possible words: 
- With R at 3: e.g., ""CARE"" but C and A are out. Not possible.
- ""BARE"" but A is out.
- ""FIRE"" but I is out? I is absent? Yes, I is absent. So no.
- ""MORE"": M, O, R, E, ? -> but E is at 4, so ""MORE"" would be M O R E, but we need 5 letters? ""MORE"" is 4 letters. We need 5-letter words.

5-letter words with pattern _ _ R E _

Examples:
- ""STORE"" but S and T? S is absent, T is available? S is absent, so no.
- ""CHORE"" but C and H? C is absent, so no.
- ""WHORE"" but W,H,O,R,E? But O is available, but we have E at 4, so ""WHORE"" is W H O R E -> positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:O? No, we need R at position 3. ""WHORE"" has R at 4? W H O R E -> 1:W, 2:H, 3:O, 4:R, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, so position 4 must be E, but here it's R? Not matching.

We need the fourth letter to be E, so for pattern _ _ R E _, it means:
Position 1: ?
Position 2: ?
Position 3: R
Position 4: E
Position 5: ?

Similarly, for pattern _ _ _ E R: 
Position 1: ?
Position 2: ?
Position 3: ?
Position 4: E
Position 5: R

Now, let's find words for pattern 1: _ _ R E _

With available letters: no C,A,N,I,D,S.

Possible words:
- ""PARER"" but P,A,R,E,R? A is absent, and duplicate R? Also, E at 4? ""PARER"": P A R E R -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:R, 4:E, 5:R -> but A is absent, so invalid.
- ""MOVER"": M O V E R? But E is at 4? ""MOVER"": M O V E R -> 1:M, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R -> this is pattern _ _ _ E R, not _ _ R E _.

For pattern _ _ R E _:
- ""BORED"": B O R E D -> but D is absent? D is absent, so no.
- ""FOREX""? Not common word.
- ""GORED"": G O R E D -> D absent.
- ""HORDE"": H O R D E -> D absent, and E at 5? ""HORDE"" is H O R D E -> 1:H,2:O,3:R,4:D,5:E -> but we need E at 4, so position 4 is D? Not E. So no.

It seems hard to find a word for _ _ R E _ with the constraints.

Perhaps ""MURRE"" or ""PURGE""? 
- ""PURGE"": P U R G E -> 1:P, 2:U, 3:R, 4:G, 5:E -> position 4 is G, not E. So no.

We need position 4 to be E, so for pattern _ _ R E _, it must have E at position 4? No: the pattern is _ _ R E _, meaning:
Position 1: letter
Position 2: letter
Position 3: R
Position 4: E
Position 5: letter

But in ""PURGE"", position 4 is G, not E.

So we need a word where position 4 is E and position 3 is R? But we are considering the case where R is at position 3.

But in the word, position 4 is fixed as E, so if R is at 3, then we have ... R E ...

But let's list words ending with ""RE"" but that's position 4 and 5? No.

Perhaps it's easier to think of words that have E at position 4.

So the word must be: ? ? ? E ?

And R must be at 3 or 5.

Case 1: R at position 3: then word is ? ? R E ?
Case 2: R at position 5: then word is ? ? ? E R

Now, for case 1: ? ? R E ?

With available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding C,A,N,I,D,S)

Possible words:
- ""BORED"" -> B O R E D -> but D is absent, invalid.
- ""FIRED"" -> F I R E D -> I and D absent.
- ""HORDE"" -> H O R D E -> D absent, and E at 5? No, position 4 is D? H O R D E: pos4=D, pos5=E -> not E at 4.
- ""LURED"" -> L U R E D -> D absent.
- ""MURKY"" -> M U R K Y -> no E at 4? Position 4 is K, not E.
- ""PUREE"" -> P U R E E -> but E at 4 and 5? ""PUREE"": P U R E E -> pos1:P,2:U,3:R,4:E,5:E -> this fits: ? ? R E ? with ? at 1,2,5 being P,U,E? But E at 5 is duplicate? And E is at 4 and 5.

But the secret word has E at position 4, but it might have another E? We don't know. But in our first guess, we had E and it was not at 5, but now we know E is at 4, so position 5 could be E? But the feedback for first guess E(-) at position 5 means that E is not at 5, so the secret word does not have E at position 5. Therefore, position 5 cannot be E. So ""PUREE"" has E at 5, which would be invalid for secret word? But we are guessing, so we can guess it, but it would be inconsistent with what we know? No, we can guess it, but we know that if we guess E at 5, it will be marked absent (since E is not at 5) or if the word has duplicate E? But we don't know if duplicate E is possible.

But from first guess, E was not at 5, but it could be at 4 and also at 5? No, because if E were at 5, the first guess would have shown E as correct or wrong position? In first guess, we had E at position 5, and it was marked (-) meaning present but wrong position. That means E is in the word but not at position 5. So if E were also at position 4, it would still be marked present but not at 5. But the feedback doesn't tell us about position 4. So it's possible that E is at 4 and not at 5, and no duplicate.

But in ""PUREE"", we have E at 4 and 5, but we know E is not at 5, so for secret word, position 5 cannot be E. Therefore, ""PUREE"" as a guess is okay, but it has E at 5 which we know is wrong, so it will be marked as present but wrong position? But E is already at 4, which is correct, so position 5 E would be marked as absent? Let's think about feedback rules.

If the secret word has only one E, and we guess two E's, then:
- If we guess E at position 4 and it is correct, it gets ✓.
- If we guess E at position 5 and the secret word has no E at 5, it should be marked x (absent) if there is no second E? But the feedback for duplicate letters: typically in Wordle, if the letter appears once, and you guess it twice, the second one might be marked x if not present.

Standard Wordle rules: for duplicate letters, if the secret has one E, and you guess two E's, the first one in correct position gets ✓, and the second one in wrong position gets x (because there's no extra E). Or if the first one is in wrong position, it gets -, and the second one might get x.

But in this case, for ""PUREE"" as a guess:
- Position 4: E is correct, so ✓.
- Position 5: E is not in the secret word (since only one E at position 4), so it should be x.

But we are trying to guess, so it's acceptable, but it wastes a letter.

To avoid confusion, better to avoid duplicate letters in guess.

So back to finding words.

For case 1: ? ? R E ? with no C,A,N,I,D,S and no duplicate.

Possible words: 
- ""FOREMAN"" too long.
- 5-letter: ""FOREM"" not a word.
- ""GORED"" invalid.
- ""HOVER"" H O V E R -> but this is ? ? ? E R, not ? ? R E ?.

""BORNE"" but B O R N E -> N is absent.

""PURGE"" P U R G E -> positions: 1:P,2:U,3:R,4:G,5:E -> but position 4 is G, not E. We need position 4 to be E, so this has E at 5.

I think I'm confusing the pattern.

For case 1, we want R at position 3 and E at position 4, so the word must have letter3=R and letter4=E.

So words like X X R E X.

Examples:
- ""BREAD"" but B R E A D -> position 3 is E, not R? ""BREAD"": B at1, R at2, E at3, A at4, D at5 -> not matching.
- ""TREND"" T R E N D -> position 3 is E, not R.
- ""CREST"" C R E S T -> C and S absent, and position 3 is E.

We need position 3=R and position 4=E.

""FREED"" F R E E D -> duplicate E, and D absent.
""GREET"" G R E E T -> duplicate E.
""PREXY"" not a word.
""TREYF"" not a word.

It's difficult. Perhaps there are no common words with R at 3 and E at 4 with the available letters.

Let's try case 2: R at position 5, so pattern ? ? ? E R

Then the word is letter1, letter2, letter3, E, R.

With available letters.

Examples:
- ""LATER"" but A is absent.
- ""METER"" M E T E R -> duplicate E, and position 4 is E? ""METER"": M at1, E at2, T at3, E at4, R at5 -> but we need position 4 to be E, which it is, and position 5=R. But it has E at2 and E at4, so duplicate E. Also, E at2 is new? But we know E is at4, so E at2 might be absent or wrong position.

But duplicate.

""POWER"" P O W E R -> positions: P at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5 -> perfect! No duplicate, and letters P,O,W are available.

""POWER"" is a valid word.

Other options:
- ""TOWER"" T O W E R -> similar, T available.
- ""MOWER"" M O W E R -> M available.
- ""COVER"" but C absent.
- ""HOVER"" H O V E R -> H and V available.
- ""LOVER"" L O V E R -> L and V.

All good.

Now, we also have the possibility that R is at position 3, but we couldn't find a word, so maybe it's not likely? Or we missed a word.

Another word for case 1: ""BOREE"" not common.
""FORZE"" not word.

Perhaps ""QUREK"" not word.

So probably, the secret word is more likely to have R at position 5.

For the third guess, we can guess a word that has R at position 5 and E at position 4, and test other positions.

For example, ""POWER"": tests P at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.

If we guess this, and if R is indeed at position 5, we might get R(✓), and E(✓), and information about P,O,W.

If R is not at 5, then we will get R(-) for position 5, meaning R is present but not at 5, so it must be at position 3 (since positions 1 and 2 are ruled out).

But in that case, we would have to use a different word.

But with ""POWER"", we cover the case for R at 5 and also test three new letters.

Similarly, ""TOWER"" or ""MOWER"" are also good.

I think ""POWER"" is fine.

But let's see if we can include more common letters.

Available common letters: O, T, L, etc.

""LOWER"": L O W E R -> L at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.

""TOWER"": T O W E R.

All similar.

I'll go with ""POWER"".

But we have to make sure we don't use absent letters.

P, O, W, E, R: E and R are known, P,O,W not used before.

So guess ""POWER"".

But in the feedback, we might get:

- If R is at 5, then R(✓)
- E is at 4, so E(✓)
- Then P, O, W will be checked.

If R is not at 5, then R(-) meaning R is present but not at 5, so it must be at 3.

And then we know.

Also, if any of P,O,W are in the word, we get feedback.

So it's a good guess.

Therefore, third guess: POWER

Step-by-step:

- E is confirmed at position 4.
- R is present but not at position 1 or 2, so must be at 3 or 5.
- To test R at position 5 and introduce new common letters, guess ""POWER"" which places R at 5 and E at 4.
- This will either confirm R at position 5 or reveal that R must be at position 3 (if R is marked as present but wrong position at 5).
- Also tests P, O, W in positions 1, 2, and 3.

<guess>POWER</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **E is confirmed at position 4** (from Guess 2: E(✓)).
- **R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2** (from Guess 1: R(-) at position 2; Guess 2: R(-) at position 1). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 5.
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, I, D, S (marked ""x"" in feedback).
- **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the third guess, I need to:
- Test the position of R (position 3 or 5).
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.
- Keep E fixed at position 4.

A strong guess is **POWER**:
- **P, O, W** are new, common letters not yet tested.
- **E** is placed at position 4 (confirmed correct).
- **R** is placed at position 5 (testing if R is at position 5; if not, it must be at position 3).
- Avoids all absent letters (C, A, N, I, D, S).

This guess efficiently narrows down R's position while covering frequent English letters.

<guess>POWER</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: RIDES -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x)
Guess 3: POWER -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: absent (x)
- R: present, wrong position (-) [position 2]
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (-) [position 5]

Guess 2: RIDES
- R: present, wrong position (-) [position 1]
- I: absent (x)
- D: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) [position 4]
- S: absent (x)

Guess 3: POWER
- P: absent (x)
- O: correct position (✓) [position 2]
- W: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) [position 4]
- R: correct position (✓) [position 5]

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. **Correct positions:**
   - Position 2: O (from POWER: O(✓))
   - Position 4: E (from RIDES: E(✓) and confirmed in POWER)
   - Position 5: R (from POWER: R(✓))

2. **Absent letters:** C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W (all marked x in guesses)

3. **Present letters with known positions:**
   - O at position 2, E at position 4, R at position 5.

4. **Other present letters:**
   - From Guess 1, R was present but not at position 2, and now we know it's at position 5.
   - E was present but not at position 5, and now we know it's at position 4.

5. **Letters not yet tested:** We have used C, R, A, N, E, I, D, S, P, O, W. So absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W.

   Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But note: the secret word has O at 2, E at 4, R at 5. So the word is: _ O _ E R

We need to find the first and third letters.

From the feedback, we know that the first and third positions must be filled with letters from the available set, excluding the absent letters.

Also, we have no other known present letters? From the guesses, all letters that are present should be accounted for? Let's see:

- In Guess 1: R and E are present (and now placed).
- In Guess 2: R and E are present (R not at 1, E at 4).
- In Guess 3: O, E, R are present and correct, P and W absent.

So, are there any other letters that must be present? Not necessarily. The secret word has exactly the letters O, E, R, and two more letters that are not in the absent list.

The secret word is: [letter1] O [letter3] E R

We need to find letter1 and letter3 from the available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Common letters among these: T, L, M, H, etc.

We need to form a valid English word.

Possible words:

- Letter1 and letter3 must be chosen such that the word exists.

Examples:
- ""HOVER"" but H O V E R -> but V is available? But ""HOVER"" has V at position 3. However, we have W absent? W is absent, but V is not tried. But ""HOVER"" is H O V E R, which matches the pattern. But we need to check if V is allowed? V hasn't been tested, so it could be present or absent.

But in our guess, we can guess ""HOVER"" to test H and V.

But we have only two positions to guess, so we can guess a word that uses common letters to cover possibilities.

Since we have two unknowns, we can make a guess that tests both.

But we also need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? Not likely, but possible.

Common words with pattern _ O _ E R:

- ""BOXER"": B O X E R -> B and X are available.
- ""CODER"" but C and D are absent.
- ""FOYER"": F O Y E R -> F and Y available.
- ""HOMER"": H O M E R -> H and M available.
- ""LOVER"": L O V E R -> L and V available.
- ""MOVER"": M O V E R -> M and V available, but we know M and V not tried.
- ""ROVER"": R O V E R -> but R is at position 1? But we have R at position 5, and if R is at position 1, it would be duplicate? But in POWER, R is at 5 and correct, so if we have R at 1, it might be duplicate? But we don't know if duplicate is allowed.

But in the first guess, CRANE had no duplicate, and secret word might have duplicates? But let's avoid for now.

- ""TOWER"": T O W E R -> but W is absent (from POWER: W(x)), so invalid.

Similarly, ""POWER"" we already guessed, P absent.

So possible words: ""BOXER"", ""FOYER"", ""HOMER"", ""LOVER"", ""MOVER"", ""ROVER"" (but R duplicate), ""SOWER"" S absent, etc.

""TOTER"" T O T E R -> duplicate T? But T not tried.

But let's list without duplicates for simplicity.

- ""BOXER"": B at1, X at3
- ""FOYER"": F at1, Y at3
- ""HOMER"": H at1, M at3
- ""LOVER"": L at1, V at3
- ""MOVER"": M at1, V at3

We need to choose one that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Since we have to guess, we can pick one that tests frequent letters.

For example, T is a very common letter, but in the pattern, position 1 or 3 could be T.

Is there a word like ""TOTER""? T O T E R -> positions: T at1, O at2, T at3, E at4, R at5. Duplicate T? But it's a valid word.

""OTHER"": O T H E R -> but O is at position 2? ""OTHER"" is O T H E R, so position 1:O, but we need position 2:O, so position 1 must be different. ""OTHER"" has O at position 1, not 2. So not matching.

""OTTER"" O T T E R -> O at position 1, not 2.

No word with T at position 1 and something at 3? Like ""TOKER"" not common.

""TOWER"" has W absent.

So T might not be easy to fit.

L is common: ""LOVER"" is a good word.

Similarly, M: ""MOVER"" or ""MOWER"" but W absent.

""HOMER"" is a name, but acceptable.

""BOXER"" is common.

I think ""LOVER"" is a good choice because L and V are common.

But we can also consider that we have no information on L or V.

Similarly, ""HOVER"" is also good.

But ""HOVER"" has H and V.

To test two new letters, ""LOVER"" or ""HOVER"" are fine.

I'll go with ""LOVER"": L at position 1, V at position 3.

If we guess ""LOVER"", we can get feedback on L and V.

If L is correct at position 1, we get ✓, else if present but wrong position, -, or absent x.

Similarly for V at position 3.

And since O, E, R are fixed, they will be ✓.

So guess ""LOVER"".

But let's confirm the pattern: L O V E R -> position 1:L, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R. Matches.

And L and V are not in the absent list.

So it's a valid guess.

Therefore, fourth guess: LOVER

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The secret word has O at position 2, E at position 4, and R at position 5.
- The first and third positions are unknown and must be filled with letters not in the absent list (C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W).
- ""LOVER"" is a common word that fits the pattern and tests L at position 1 and V at position 3.
- Feedback will confirm or deny L and V, helping to solve the word.

<guess>LOVER</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Correct positions confirmed:**
  - Position 2: O (from POWER: O(✓))
  - Position 4: E (from RIDES: E(✓) and POWER: E(✓))
  - Position 5: R (from POWER: R(✓))
- **Absent letters:** C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W (marked ""x"" in feedback).
- **Secret word pattern:** The word must be _ O _ E R (unknown first and third positions).
- **Available letters:** B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z (excluding absent letters).

For the fourth guess, I need to:
- Test possible letters for positions 1 and 3.
- Use common letters to maximize information.
- Avoid absent letters.

A strong guess is **LOVER**:
- **L** at position 1: Tests a common consonant.
- **V** at position 3: Tests a less common letter, helping to confirm or eliminate possibilities.
- **O, E, R** are placed in their known correct positions (2, 4, 5) to validate the pattern.
- This guess efficiently narrows down the remaining letters while fitting the established constraints.

- L: absent (x)
- O: correct position (✓) [position 2]
- V: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) [position 4]
- R: correct position (✓) [position 5]

Now, we know:
- The secret word has O at position 2, E at position 4, and R at position 5. So the pattern is: _ O _ E R
- Absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W, L, V (all marked x in guesses)
- Therefore, available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, X, Y, Z (since C,A,N,I,D,S,P,W,L,V are out)

We need to find the first and third letters from the available set.

The secret word is: [letter1] O [letter3] E R

We must choose a word that fits this pattern, using only the available letters.

Possible words:
- ""HOMER"": H O M E R -> H and M are available? H not tried, M not tried. But ""HOMER"" is a valid word.
- ""BOXER"": B O X E R -> B and X available.
- ""FOYER"": F O Y E R -> F and Y available.
- ""JOKER"": J O K E R -> J and K available.
- ""TOWER"": but W is absent, so no.
- ""MOVER"": M O V E R -> but V is absent (from LOVER: V(x)), so invalid.
- ""ROVER"": R O V E R -> V absent and duplicate R? Not good.

Other possibilities: ""BAKER"" but A absent, ""MAKER"" A absent, etc.

With available letters, let's list possible words:

- ""HOMER"": H at1, M at3
- ""BOXER"": B at1, X at3
- ""FOYER"": F at1, Y at3
- ""JOKER"": J at1, K at3
- ""TOPER"": T O P E R -> but P is absent (from POWER: P(x)), so invalid.
- ""GOFER"": G O F E R -> G and F available? ""GOFER"" is a word? Yes, meaning an employee who runs errands. G at1, F at3.
- ""HOVER"" but V absent.
- ""MOWER"" W absent.

Also, ""COMET"" but pattern not match.

So possible: ""HOMER"", ""BOXER"", ""FOYER"", ""JOKER"", ""GOFER"".

We need to guess one that might be the word or get information.

But since we have only two positions, and we know the pattern, we can guess one that uses common letters.

Common letters left: T, but no word with T? ""TOKER"" not common, ""TOTER"" T O T E R -> duplicate T? And T available.

""TOTER"" is a word, meaning one who carries. T at1, T at3? Duplicate.

But we can consider.

Similarly, ""HOMER"" is quite common.

Since we have multiple options, we should choose a word that tests letters that cover more possibilities.

But we have no prior on which letters are more likely, so any is fine.

Perhaps ""HOMER"" is a good choice.

But let's see the feedback: in LOVER, L and V are absent, so we have more absent letters.

Now, for the fifth guess, we can guess ""HOMER"".

If it's not, we get feedback on H and M.

But we have only 6 guesses, and this is guess 5.

We have two positions, so we might need two guesses, but we have two left.

After this guess, we might solve or have one more.

But let's guess ""HOMER"".

If correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback on H and M.

For example, if H is absent, then we know position 1 is not H, and similarly for M.

Then we can guess another word like ""BOXER"" or ""FOYER"".

But to save a guess, if we can.

But we don't know.

Another idea: is there a word that uses more than one possible letter? No, because we have to fill specific positions.

We could guess a word that has a different letter at position 1 and 3 to test both.

But all options do that.

I think ""HOMER"" is a reasonable guess.

Perhaps ""TOWER"" but W absent, no.

""BOWER"" W absent.

So I'll go with ""HOMER"".

But let's confirm: H and M are available, not absent.

So guess ""HOMER"".

Therefore, fifth guess: HOMER

Step-by-step:
- Secret word pattern: _ O _ E R
- Absent letters: C,A,N,I,D,S,P,W,L,V
- Available: B,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,T,U,X,Y,Z
- ""HOMER"" fits: H at position 1, M at position 3, with O,E,R fixed.
- If correct, solved. If not, feedback on H and M will help for the final guess.

<guess>HOMER</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Current Word Pattern from Feedback**:
   - Position 2: **O** (confirmed correct in Guess 3 and 4).
   - Position 4: **E** (confirmed correct in Guess 2, 3, and 4).
   - Position 5: **R** (confirmed correct in Guess 3 and 4).
   - The secret word pattern is: **? O ? E R** (unknown first and third positions).

2. **Absent Letters**:
   - From all feedback: **C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W, L, V** are absent (marked ""x"" in guesses).
   - Available letters: **B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, X, Y, Z**.

3. **Previous Guess Analysis**:
   - Guess 4 (LOVER) eliminated **L** and **V**, confirming **O, E, R** positions.
   - Only positions 1 and 3 remain unknown, with limited letters left.

4. **Possible Words**:
   - With the pattern **? O ? E R** and available letters, common English words include:
     - **HOMER**: H at position 1, M at position 3.
     - **BOXER**: B at position 1, X at position 3.
     - **FOYER**: F at position 1, Y at position 3.
     - **JOKER**: J at position 1, K at position 3.
     - **GOFER**: G at position 1, F at position 3.
     - **TOTER**: T at position 1, T at position 3 (duplicate T, but valid).

5. **Strategy for Guess 5**:
   - **HOMER** is chosen because:
     - **H** and **M** are high-frequency consonants not yet tested.
     - It tests two new letters at once, maximizing information if incorrect.
     - If correct, the game is solved. If not, feedback on **H** and **M** (absent or position) will pinpoint the solution with the final guess.
   - Other options like BOXER or FOYER are less common, and TOTER has a duplicate letter, which is less likely.

6. **Risk Consideration**:
   - With only 2 guesses left (this is Guess 5), **HOMER** is efficient—it either wins or provides clear feedback for Guess 6.
   - If **H** or **M** is absent, we eliminate them and focus on other options (e.g., BOXER, FOYER) next.

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.\n Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We can choose a word that covers frequent letters.\n\n Let\'s consider the frequency of letters in 5-letter English words.

Yes, it is.\n\n So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".I am starting the game and need to make my first guess. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word with common letters to maximize information. The most frequent letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, and N. A strong starting word should include several of these. ""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because it contains C (common consonant), R (2nd most common consonant), A (common vowel), N (common consonant), and E (most common vowel). This combination covers frequent letters and positions, helping me gather useful feedback for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)\nInterpretation:\n- C is not in the word at all.\n- R is in the word but not in the second position (where we guessed it).\n- A is not in the word at all.\n- N is not in the word at all.\n- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.\n\nSo, we know:\n- The word contains R and E, but not in the positions we guessed.\n- The word does NOT contain C, A, N.\n\nSince R is in the word but not in position 2, and E is in the word but not in position 5, and our guess had R in position 2 and E in position 5, they must be elsewhere.\n\nNow, we need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word without C, A, N, and including R and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively? Actually, the position constraints: \n- R cannot be in position 2 (because feedback was R(-), meaning it\'s present but wrong position).\n- E cannot be in position 5.\n\nMoreover, since the word has R and E, and no C, A, N, we can list possible letters.\n\nWe also note that the word might have other letters. Since A and C are out, we should avoid vowels that are less common? We have E, so we focus on common consonants and vowels.\n\nCommon remaining letters: E, R, and others like O, I, T, S, L, etc.\n\nBut we know R is in the word, so we must include R. Similarly, E must be included.\n\nIn the new guess, we should place R in a position that is not 2, and E in a position that is not 5. Also, avoid positions 1,3,4 for R and E? Wait, the feedback doesn\'t say anything about positions 1,3,4 being correct or not for R and E? Actually:\n\n- For R: only position 2 is wrong, so it could be in position 1,3,4, or even 5? But position 5 might be taken by E? Actually, E cannot be in position 5 in the secret word, so E must be in positions 1-4.\n\nSimilarly, R must be in positions 1,3,4, or 5? But we don\'t know about position 5 for R. Since E is in the word and not in position 5, R could be in position 5? Yes.\n\nSo constraints:\n- The word must include R and E.\n- R not in position 2.\n- E not in position 5.\n- No C, A, N.\n\nNow, our goal is to guess a word that respects these constraints and uses common letters to test other positions.\n\nWe should also try to get information about other letters. Since E is in the word, let\'s think about possible positions.\n\nPossible positions for E: since not at 5, it must be at 1,2,3, or 4.\nSimilarly for R: not at 2, so at 1,3,4,5.\n\nWe should avoid placing E in position 5 (already forbidden) and R in position 2.\n\nBut in our new guess, we can put E and R in any positions we want, remembering the feedback rules.\n\nWhat word to choose? Let\'s think of common words with R and E, and without C, A, N.\n\nAlso, the word should not reuse letters that are already known absent: C, A, N.\n\nWe have already used C, R, A, N, E. From this, we know E and R are present, so we should reuse E and R in the new guess? But note: in Wordle-like games, reusing letters that are present is good to find their positions.\n\nSo, we must include R and E in our new guess.\n\nWe need a word that contains R and E, not containing C, A, N.\n\nPossible words: \n- Words like ""ROBES"", ""STORE"", ""GUIDE"" (but GUIDEs has D and U, and E at end? We know E not at end? No, E not at position 5, so in STORE E is at 5, which is forbidden? Yes, so avoid words ending with E.\n\nIn the secret word, E cannot be at position 5, but in our guess, we can put E at any position? Yes, because we are testing. However, if we put E at position 5, we expect it to be marked x or -, but we know in the secret word E is not at position 5, so if we put E at 5, it will be wrong position? Actually, feedback: if we put E at 5, and E is in the word elsewhere, it will show -. If E is not at 5, and we guess E at 5, it will be wrong position only if E is present? Yes.\n\nBut to avoid wasting the E test, we should put E in a position where it might be correct, i.e., positions 1-4.\n\nSimilarly for R, avoid position 2.\n\nSo, good choices: put R in position 1,3,4, or 5; and E in position 1,2,3, or 4.\n\nNow, what about the other letters? We need new letters to test.\n\nPossible candidates:\n\n- Words beginning with R: e.g., ""RESTS"", but S in it. But we don\'t know anything about S. However, ""RESTS"" has E at position 2 and R at 1, which we can test.\n\nBut ""RESTS"" has T and S, common letters.\n\nBut also, we want to use letters not yet tried? Yes, to get more information.\n\nLetters tried so far: C, R, A, N, E. So we haven\'t tried S, T, O, I, L, etc.\n\nGood words: ""RISES"" has I and S. But A is forbidden? Yes, but no A. However, ""RISES"" has R at 1, I at 2, S at 3, E at 4, S at 5. Position: E at 4, and R at 1 (which is not position 2). Good. And no C,A,N.\n\nBut in the secret word, E is present but not at position 5? Here E is at 4.\n\nPossibly.\n\nWord ""ROLES"": R at 1, O at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5. E at 4 (which is allowed for secret word), R at 1 (not position 2). Good.\n\nBut we need to see which one is better.\n\nAnother word: ""TRIES"" - T, R, I, E, S. Positions: R at 2? But R cannot be at position 2 because the feedback for our first guess told us R is not in position 2. So if we put R at position 2, it will be wrong again? No, the secret word has R, but not at position 2. So in a new position, we must avoid putting R at position 2 because we know it\'s not there.\n\nIn ""TRIES"": T position 1, R position 2. But R at position 2 in the guess would trigger a ""-"" because R is present but not in position 2. But we are not learning new? We are confirming that position 2 is wrong for R. But since we already know that, it\'s redundant.\n\nTo maximize new information, we should place R in a position where it might be correct, i.e., positions 1,3,4,5.\n\nFor example, ""TRIES"" with R at position 2 is inefficient because it re-tests position 2.\n\nBetter to put R at a new position.\n\nSimilarly for E, avoid position 5? But E at position 5: we know in secret word E is not at 5, so if we guess E at 5, we\'ll just get a ""-"" which tells us E is elsewhere, but we already know E is present. So it wastes a chance to pinpoint E\'s position? Yes.\n\nTherefore, best to put E in one of positions 1-4 to see if that position is correct.\n\nSimilarly for R, put in positions 1,3,4,5 (avoiding 2).\n\nNow, let\'s list possible words.\n\nOption 1: ""PORTS"" - has P,O,R,T,S. But E is required? We must include E because we know E is in the word. If we don\'t include E, and E is in the word, we may miss it? But the word must contain E? No, our guess doesn\'t have to include E if we are testing other letters? But we know E is in the secret word, so to get information about E\'s position, we should include it? Not necessarily, but including E helps us to find its position.\n\nIncluding E and R in the guess is efficient because we can test new positions.\n\nIf we skip E or R, we might get less information.\n\nSo prioritise words with both E and R.\n\nWords with R and E, no C,A,N, E not at end? Optional in guess, but as reasoned, better to avoid E at 5 for new guess.\n\nSome options:\n\n- ""SERVE"": S, E, R, V, E? Letters: E at pos1, R at pos3, and E at pos5? But E at 5: since we know E is not at 5 in secret word, if we guess E at 5, we\'ll get ""-"" meaning E is present but not at that position. But we have two E\'s? And in ""SERVE"", E is at position 1 and 5.\n\nBut the secret word might or might not have duplicates? But in our first guess, we had no duplicates, so we don\'t know if duplicates are possible.\n\nBut to avoid complications, guess words without duplicates for now.\n\nBetter single E.\n\nWord ""ROGUE"": R at 1, O at 2, G at 3, U at 4, E at 5. But E at 5: if we guess E at 5, and secret word E not at 5, we\'ll get ""-"". Also, U is less common.\n\nWord ""RIDES"": R at 1, I at 2, D at 3, E at 4, S at 5. E at position 4 (good, not 5), R at position 1 (good, not 2). Also, includes D and S, which are untested.\n\nSimilarly, ""TREES"": T, R, E, E, S? Duplicate E, and R at 2? Avoid R at 2.\n\n""DRIVE"": D at 1, R at 2? Avoid R at 2.\n\n""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E. Positions: R at position 2? Avoid position 2 for R.\n\nHow about ""SPIRE"": S, P, I, R, E? E at position 5? Avoid E at 5 if possible. Put E at position 5? We\'ll get ""-"", but we could.\n\nBut to conserve, better put E in 1-4.\n\nSo back to ""RIDES"": R at 1, I at 2, D at 3, E at 4, S at 5. \n- R position 1: If R is at position 1 for secret word, we get ✓, else ""-"".\n- E position 4: similar.\n- Also tests I,D,S.\n\nAnother option: ""ROPES"": R at 1, O at 2, P at 3, E at 4, S at 5. Similarly.\n\n""ROPES"" has O and P, which are common.\n\n""RIDES"": R, I, D, E, S.\n\nWe also have ""REUSE"": R at 1? But ""REUSE"" has two E\'s? Not ideal. ""REUSE"": R, E, U, S, E? E at position 2 and 5.\n\nAvoid.\n\nBetter ""RIDES"" or ""ROPES"", or ""TILES""? But TILES has T,I,L,E,S but no R? We must include R? Not mandatory for guess, but to test R, better include.\n\nWe know R is present, so including it can confirm position.\n\nOption: ""RETCH"" but C is out? We have C as absent, ""RETCH"" has C? No, C is invalid? ""RETCH"" has C? The word contains C? Yes, so avoid.\n\n""RESTS"": R, E, S, T, S? But R at position 1, E at position 2, S at 3 and 5? And T at 4? Good positions? E at 2: since E is present but not necessarily at 2. But we don\'t have any constraint on E position except not 5? And R not at 2. In ""RESTS"", R at 1 (okay), E at 2 (could be), and avoids E at 5.\n\nAlso, includes S and T, common letters.\n\nBut duplicate S? Not a problem necessarily.\n\nCompared to ""RIDES"": both have S at the end? ""RESTS"" ends with S, ""RIDES"" also ends with S.\n\nBut ""RESTS"" might be better because it also has T.\n\nBut E is at position 2 in ""RESTS"", while in ""RIDES"" E is at 4.\n\nWe don\'t know which positions E might be.\n\nNow, deciding between ""RESTS"" and ""RIDES"".\n\nPerhaps ""STREP"", but that ends with P? ""STREP"": S,T,R,E,P. E at 4? R at 3? Positions: position1=S,2=T,3=R,4=E,5=P? Then S,T,R,E,P.\n\nR is at position 3 (which is not 2, allowed), E at position 4 (not 5, avoided).\n\nAnd includes S,T,P.\n\nAlso, all unique letters? ""STREP"" has S,T,R,E,P — unique letters.\n\nGood candidate.\n\nBut ""STREP"" means a type of bacteria? Might be obscure. Is ""strep"" a valid common word? Not ideal.\n\nPerhaps ""STRIP"" but no E? Must have E? Not required, but E is in word? We should include E.\n\nThen ""SERVE"" as I thought earlier: S, E, R, V, E? E at 1 and 5? Duplicate E.\n\nBad.\n\n""VERSE"": V,E,R,S,E? Duplicate E.\n\n""GRIPE"": G,R,I,P,E? E at 5? We avoid E at 5.\n\nBut if we guess E at 5, we get ""-"" meaning E present but elsewhere.\n\nBut to save a position test, better not.\n\n""GRIME"": G,R,I,M,E? E at 5.\n\nSame.\n\n""BRIDE"": B,R,I,D,E? B might be good? But we have to avoid B? No, only C,A,N are out. B hasn\'t been tried.\n\nPositions: R at 2? Avoid R at 2. In ""BRIDE"", R is at 2? So position 2 for R? Bad.\n\nAvoid R at 2: so for words, R should be first, third, fourth, or last.\n\nPerhaps ""OREAD"": O,R,E,A,D? A is out? A is not allowed? We know A is not in word? Feedback said A(x), so absent, thus OREAD has A? Position 4? So invalid guess because A is out.\n\nThus avoid words containing A,C, or N.\n\nSo words must consist of letters not C,A,N.\n\nLetters available: B,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nBut with R and E included.\n\nAnother word: ""WISER"": W,I,S,E,R? Positions: R at last position? R at 5? Good. E at position 4? Okay. And W,I,S.\n\n""RIPER"": R,I,P,E,R? Duplicate R? Avoid.\n\nPerhaps ""DRIFT"": D,R,I,F,T? No E? Omit E.\n\nYes, we can omit E since we know E is present, and it might be tested in later guesses? But better to include now.\n\n""WRIST"": W,R,I,S,T? No E.\n\nBut E is known present, so guess should include E to find position.\n\nTherefore, going back, ""RIDES"" seems good: R in position 1, E in position 4, and I,D,S are new.\n\n""RIDES"" is a word? Yes, like horse rides.\n\nSimilarly, ""ROPES"" is also common.\n\n""ROPES"" has O, which is vowel.\n\nBut both options are fine.\n\nI think I choose ""RIDES"" for its commonality.\n\nBut ""RESTS"" might be more common? ""RESTS"" has duplicate S? But that\'s okay.\n\nAnother good one: ""STORE"" but E at 5? Avoid if possible.\n\nHow about ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E? But E at 5. No, E at 5 not desired. And no R? Omit R.\n\nMust include R? Not enforced, but we know R is present so exclude?\n\nIf we guess without R, we might get feedback that misses the R position? But we can infer.\n\nFor example, if we guess ""STOLE"", we might:\n- Get S, T, O, L, E feedback.\nBut E at 5, we know E is present but not at 5, so we\'ll get E(-).\nBut we also know R is present, but not in the guess, so the feedback won\'t tell us anything about R. Meaning, we won\'t test new positions for R.\n\nTo be efficient, better reuse known present letters R and E in new positions.\n\nTherefore, I decide to use ""RIDES"": R in position 1, I in position 2, D in position 3, E in position 4, S in position 5.\n\nSo, guess: RIDES\n\nStep-by-step reasoning: Since R is present but not at position 2, I place R at position 1 to test if it\'s there. E is present not at position 5, so I place at position 4. The word includes new letters I, D, S to gather more information.Based on the feedback from the first guess:\n- **C, A, N** are **not in the word**.\n- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2**.\n- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5**.\n\nFor the second guess, I need to include both **R and E** (since they exist in the word) but avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5. I also cannot use **C, A, or N**. Ideally, the new guess should test new positions for R and E and introduce common unused letters to gather more information.\n\nA strong candidate is **RIDES**:\n- **R** is placed in **position 1** (a possible correct position; previously not tested).\n- **E** is placed in **position 4** (avoiding position 5 and testing a new potential spot).\n- **I, D, S** are new letters (common consonants/vowels not yet tested).\n- Avoids all forbidden letters (no C, A, N) and aligns with constraints.\n\nThis should help narrow down the position of R and E while covering frequent English letters.\n\n<guess>RIDES</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: RIDES -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: CRANE\n- C: absent (x)\n- R: present but wrong position (-) [since it was in position 2, but not there]\n- A: absent (x)\n- N: absent (x)\n- E: present but wrong position (-) [position 5 is wrong]\n\nSecond guess: RIDES\n- R: present but wrong position (-) [we placed R at position 1, but it\'s not there]\n- I: absent (x)\n- D: absent (x)\n- E: correct position (✓) [we placed E at position 4, and it is correct!]\n- S: absent (x)\n\nSo, what do we know?\n1. The secret word has the letter E in position 4. (Great! So E is fixed at the 4th position.)\n2. The letter R is in the word, but it is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 1 (from second guess). So R must be in position 3 or 5? (Positions: 1,2,3,4,5; but position 4 is E, so R can be in 3 or 5.)\n3. The following letters are absent: C, A, N, I, D, S. (So we cannot use these letters.)\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we know E is present and not at position 5, which is consistent because now we know E is at 4.\n\nNow, the secret word has E at position 4, and R is present but not at 1 or 2. So R must be at position 3 or 5.\n\nAdditionally, we have no information about other letters. We have used: C, R, A, N, E, I, D, S. So absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S.\n\nAvailable letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we need to form a 5-letter word that has E at position 4 and R at either position 3 or 5.\n\nAlso, the word must include R (since it\'s present) and we know E is at 4.\n\nNow, for the third guess, we should try to determine the position of R and also test other letters.\n\nWe have two cases for R: position 3 or 5.\n\nWe can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we can only test one word.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has R in position 3 and then see, or in position 5.\n\nBut we also want to test other common letters.\n\nSince E is fixed at 4, the word pattern is: _ _ _ E _\n\nAnd R must be in the third or fifth position.\n\nSo possible patterns: \n- If R is at 3: _ _ R E _\n- If R is at 5: _ _ _ E R\n\nWe need to fill the other positions with new letters.\n\nWe should avoid the absent letters: C,A,N,I,D,S.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit these patterns.\n\nFirst, pattern: _ _ R E _\n\nPossible words: \n- With R at 3: e.g., ""CARE"" but C and A are out. Not possible.\n- ""BARE"" but A is out.\n- ""FIRE"" but I is out? I is absent? Yes, I is absent. So no.\n- ""MORE"": M, O, R, E, ? -> but E is at 4, so ""MORE"" would be M O R E, but we need 5 letters? ""MORE"" is 4 letters. We need 5-letter words.\n\n5-letter words with pattern _ _ R E _\n\nExamples:\n- ""STORE"" but S and T? S is absent, T is available? S is absent, so no.\n- ""CHORE"" but C and H? C is absent, so no.\n- ""WHORE"" but W,H,O,R,E? But O is available, but we have E at 4, so ""WHORE"" is W H O R E -> positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:O? No, we need R at position 3. ""WHORE"" has R at 4? W H O R E -> 1:W, 2:H, 3:O, 4:R, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, so position 4 must be E, but here it\'s R? Not matching.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be E, so for pattern _ _ R E _, it means:\nPosition 1: ?\nPosition 2: ?\nPosition 3: R\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: ?\n\nSimilarly, for pattern _ _ _ E R: \nPosition 1: ?\nPosition 2: ?\nPosition 3: ?\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: R\n\nNow, let\'s find words for pattern 1: _ _ R E _\n\nWith available letters: no C,A,N,I,D,S.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""PARER"" but P,A,R,E,R? A is absent, and duplicate R? Also, E at 4? ""PARER"": P A R E R -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:R, 4:E, 5:R -> but A is absent, so invalid.\n- ""MOVER"": M O V E R? But E is at 4? ""MOVER"": M O V E R -> 1:M, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R -> this is pattern _ _ _ E R, not _ _ R E _.\n\nFor pattern _ _ R E _:\n- ""BORED"": B O R E D -> but D is absent? D is absent, so no.\n- ""FOREX""? Not common word.\n- ""GORED"": G O R E D -> D absent.\n- ""HORDE"": H O R D E -> D absent, and E at 5? ""HORDE"" is H O R D E -> 1:H,2:O,3:R,4:D,5:E -> but we need E at 4, so position 4 is D? Not E. So no.\n\nIt seems hard to find a word for _ _ R E _ with the constraints.\n\nPerhaps ""MURRE"" or ""PURGE""? \n- ""PURGE"": P U R G E -> 1:P, 2:U, 3:R, 4:G, 5:E -> position 4 is G, not E. So no.\n\nWe need position 4 to be E, so for pattern _ _ R E _, it must have E at position 4? No: the pattern is _ _ R E _, meaning:\nPosition 1: letter\nPosition 2: letter\nPosition 3: R\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: letter\n\nBut in ""PURGE"", position 4 is G, not E.\n\nSo we need a word where position 4 is E and position 3 is R? But we are considering the case where R is at position 3.\n\nBut in the word, position 4 is fixed as E, so if R is at 3, then we have ... R E ...\n\nBut let\'s list words ending with ""RE"" but that\'s position 4 and 5? No.\n\nPerhaps it\'s easier to think of words that have E at position 4.\n\nSo the word must be: ? ? ? E ?\n\nAnd R must be at 3 or 5.\n\nCase 1: R at position 3: then word is ? ? R E ?\nCase 2: R at position 5: then word is ? ? ? E R\n\nNow, for case 1: ? ? R E ?\n\nWith available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding C,A,N,I,D,S)\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BORED"" -> B O R E D -> but D is absent, invalid.\n- ""FIRED"" -> F I R E D -> I and D absent.\n- ""HORDE"" -> H O R D E -> D absent, and E at 5? No, position 4 is D? H O R D E: pos4=D, pos5=E -> not E at 4.\n- ""LURED"" -> L U R E D -> D absent.\n- ""MURKY"" -> M U R K Y -> no E at 4? Position 4 is K, not E.\n- ""PUREE"" -> P U R E E -> but E at 4 and 5? ""PUREE"": P U R E E -> pos1:P,2:U,3:R,4:E,5:E -> this fits: ? ? R E ? with ? at 1,2,5 being P,U,E? But E at 5 is duplicate? And E is at 4 and 5.\n\nBut the secret word has E at position 4, but it might have another E? We don\'t know. But in our first guess, we had E and it was not at 5, but now we know E is at 4, so position 5 could be E? But the feedback for first guess E(-) at position 5 means that E is not at 5, so the secret word does not have E at position 5. Therefore, position 5 cannot be E. So ""PUREE"" has E at 5, which would be invalid for secret word? But we are guessing, so we can guess it, but it would be inconsistent with what we know? No, we can guess it, but we know that if we guess E at 5, it will be marked absent (since E is not at 5) or if the word has duplicate E? But we don\'t know if duplicate E is possible.\n\nBut from first guess, E was not at 5, but it could be at 4 and also at 5? No, because if E were at 5, the first guess would have shown E as correct or wrong position? In first guess, we had E at position 5, and it was marked (-) meaning present but wrong position. That means E is in the word but not at position 5. So if E were also at position 4, it would still be marked present but not at 5. But the feedback doesn\'t tell us about position 4. So it\'s possible that E is at 4 and not at 5, and no duplicate.\n\nBut in ""PUREE"", we have E at 4 and 5, but we know E is not at 5, so for secret word, position 5 cannot be E. Therefore, ""PUREE"" as a guess is okay, but it has E at 5 which we know is wrong, so it will be marked as present but wrong position? But E is already at 4, which is correct, so position 5 E would be marked as absent? Let\'s think about feedback rules.\n\nIf the secret word has only one E, and we guess two E\'s, then:\n- If we guess E at position 4 and it is correct, it gets ✓.\n- If we guess E at position 5 and the secret word has no E at 5, it should be marked x (absent) if there is no second E? But the feedback for duplicate letters: typically in Wordle, if the letter appears once, and you guess it twice, the second one might be marked x if not present.\n\nStandard Wordle rules: for duplicate letters, if the secret has one E, and you guess two E\'s, the first one in correct position gets ✓, and the second one in wrong position gets x (because there\'s no extra E). Or if the first one is in wrong position, it gets -, and the second one might get x.\n\nBut in this case, for ""PUREE"" as a guess:\n- Position 4: E is correct, so ✓.\n- Position 5: E is not in the secret word (since only one E at position 4), so it should be x.\n\nBut we are trying to guess, so it\'s acceptable, but it wastes a letter.\n\nTo avoid confusion, better to avoid duplicate letters in guess.\n\nSo back to finding words.\n\nFor case 1: ? ? R E ? with no C,A,N,I,D,S and no duplicate.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""FOREMAN"" too long.\n- 5-letter: ""FOREM"" not a word.\n- ""GORED"" invalid.\n- ""HOVER"" H O V E R -> but this is ? ? ? E R, not ? ? R E ?.\n\n""BORNE"" but B O R N E -> N is absent.\n\n""PURGE"" P U R G E -> positions: 1:P,2:U,3:R,4:G,5:E -> but position 4 is G, not E. We need position 4 to be E, so this has E at 5.\n\nI think I\'m confusing the pattern.\n\nFor case 1, we want R at position 3 and E at position 4, so the word must have letter3=R and letter4=E.\n\nSo words like X X R E X.\n\nExamples:\n- ""BREAD"" but B R E A D -> position 3 is E, not R? ""BREAD"": B at1, R at2, E at3, A at4, D at5 -> not matching.\n- ""TREND"" T R E N D -> position 3 is E, not R.\n- ""CREST"" C R E S T -> C and S absent, and position 3 is E.\n\nWe need position 3=R and position 4=E.\n\n""FREED"" F R E E D -> duplicate E, and D absent.\n""GREET"" G R E E T -> duplicate E.\n""PREXY"" not a word.\n""TREYF"" not a word.\n\nIt\'s difficult. Perhaps there are no common words with R at 3 and E at 4 with the available letters.\n\nLet\'s try case 2: R at position 5, so pattern ? ? ? E R\n\nThen the word is letter1, letter2, letter3, E, R.\n\nWith available letters.\n\nExamples:\n- ""LATER"" but A is absent.\n- ""METER"" M E T E R -> duplicate E, and position 4 is E? ""METER"": M at1, E at2, T at3, E at4, R at5 -> but we need position 4 to be E, which it is, and position 5=R. But it has E at2 and E at4, so duplicate E. Also, E at2 is new? But we know E is at4, so E at2 might be absent or wrong position.\n\nBut duplicate.\n\n""POWER"" P O W E R -> positions: P at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5 -> perfect! No duplicate, and letters P,O,W are available.\n\n""POWER"" is a valid word.\n\nOther options:\n- ""TOWER"" T O W E R -> similar, T available.\n- ""MOWER"" M O W E R -> M available.\n- ""COVER"" but C absent.\n- ""HOVER"" H O V E R -> H and V available.\n- ""LOVER"" L O V E R -> L and V.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, we also have the possibility that R is at position 3, but we couldn\'t find a word, so maybe it\'s not likely? Or we missed a word.\n\nAnother word for case 1: ""BOREE"" not common.\n""FORZE"" not word.\n\nPerhaps ""QUREK"" not word.\n\nSo probably, the secret word is more likely to have R at position 5.\n\nFor the third guess, we can guess a word that has R at position 5 and E at position 4, and test other positions.\n\nFor example, ""POWER"": tests P at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.\n\nIf we guess this, and if R is indeed at position 5, we might get R(✓), and E(✓), and information about P,O,W.\n\nIf R is not at 5, then we will get R(-) for position 5, meaning R is present but not at 5, so it must be at position 3 (since positions 1 and 2 are ruled out).\n\nBut in that case, we would have to use a different word.\n\nBut with ""POWER"", we cover the case for R at 5 and also test three new letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""TOWER"" or ""MOWER"" are also good.\n\nI think ""POWER"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can include more common letters.\n\nAvailable common letters: O, T, L, etc.\n\n""LOWER"": L O W E R -> L at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, R at5.\n\n""TOWER"": T O W E R.\n\nAll similar.\n\nI\'ll go with ""POWER"".\n\nBut we have to make sure we don\'t use absent letters.\n\nP, O, W, E, R: E and R are known, P,O,W not used before.\n\nSo guess ""POWER"".\n\nBut in the feedback, we might get:\n\n- If R is at 5, then R(✓)\n- E is at 4, so E(✓)\n- Then P, O, W will be checked.\n\nIf R is not at 5, then R(-) meaning R is present but not at 5, so it must be at 3.\n\nAnd then we know.\n\nAlso, if any of P,O,W are in the word, we get feedback.\n\nSo it\'s a good guess.\n\nTherefore, third guess: POWER\n\nStep-by-step:\n\n- E is confirmed at position 4.\n- R is present but not at position 1 or 2, so must be at 3 or 5.\n- To test R at position 5 and introduce new common letters, guess ""POWER"" which places R at 5 and E at 4.\n- This will either confirm R at position 5 or reveal that R must be at position 3 (if R is marked as present but wrong position at 5).\n- Also tests P, O, W in positions 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<guess>POWER</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **E is confirmed at position 4** (from Guess 2: E(✓)).\n- **R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2** (from Guess 1: R(-) at position 2; Guess 2: R(-) at position 1). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 5.\n- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, I, D, S (marked ""x"" in feedback).\n- **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nFor the third guess, I need to:\n- Test the position of R (position 3 or 5).\n- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.\n- Keep E fixed at position 4.\n\nA strong guess is **POWER**:\n- **P, O, W** are new, common letters not yet tested.\n- **E** is placed at position 4 (confirmed correct).\n- **R** is placed at position 5 (testing if R is at position 5; if not, it must be at position 3).\n- Avoids all absent letters (C, A, N, I, D, S).\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down R\'s position while covering frequent English letters.\n\n<guess>POWER</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: RIDES -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: POWER -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: absent (x)\n- R: present, wrong position (-) [position 2]\n- A: absent (x)\n- N: absent (x)\n- E: present, wrong position (-) [position 5]\n\nGuess 2: RIDES\n- R: present, wrong position (-) [position 1]\n- I: absent (x)\n- D: absent (x)\n- E: correct position (✓) [position 4]\n- S: absent (x)\n\nGuess 3: POWER\n- P: absent (x)\n- O: correct position (✓) [position 2]\n- W: absent (x)\n- E: correct position (✓) [position 4]\n- R: correct position (✓) [position 5]\n\nNow, let\'s consolidate what we know:\n\n1. **Correct positions:**\n   - Position 2: O (from POWER: O(✓))\n   - Position 4: E (from RIDES: E(✓) and confirmed in POWER)\n   - Position 5: R (from POWER: R(✓))\n\n2. **Absent letters:** C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W (all marked x in guesses)\n\n3. **Present letters with known positions:**\n   - O at position 2, E at position 4, R at position 5.\n\n4. **Other present letters:**\n   - From Guess 1, R was present but not at position 2, and now we know it\'s at position 5.\n   - E was present but not at position 5, and now we know it\'s at position 4.\n\n5. **Letters not yet tested:** We have used C, R, A, N, E, I, D, S, P, O, W. So absent letters: C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W.\n\n   Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: the secret word has O at 2, E at 4, R at 5. So the word is: _ O _ E R\n\nWe need to find the first and third letters.\n\nFrom the feedback, we know that the first and third positions must be filled with letters from the available set, excluding the absent letters.\n\nAlso, we have no other known present letters? From the guesses, all letters that are present should be accounted for? Let\'s see:\n\n- In Guess 1: R and E are present (and now placed).\n- In Guess 2: R and E are present (R not at 1, E at 4).\n- In Guess 3: O, E, R are present and correct, P and W absent.\n\nSo, are there any other letters that must be present? Not necessarily. The secret word has exactly the letters O, E, R, and two more letters that are not in the absent list.\n\nThe secret word is: [letter1] O [letter3] E R\n\nWe need to find letter1 and letter3 from the available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon letters among these: T, L, M, H, etc.\n\nWe need to form a valid English word.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- Letter1 and letter3 must be chosen such that the word exists.\n\nExamples:\n- ""HOVER"" but H O V E R -> but V is available? But ""HOVER"" has V at position 3. However, we have W absent? W is absent, but V is not tried. But ""HOVER"" is H O V E R, which matches the pattern. But we need to check if V is allowed? V hasn\'t been tested, so it could be present or absent.\n\nBut in our guess, we can guess ""HOVER"" to test H and V.\n\nBut we have only two positions to guess, so we can guess a word that uses common letters to cover possibilities.\n\nSince we have two unknowns, we can make a guess that tests both.\n\nBut we also need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? Not likely, but possible.\n\nCommon words with pattern _ O _ E R:\n\n- ""BOXER"": B O X E R -> B and X are available.\n- ""CODER"" but C and D are absent.\n- ""FOYER"": F O Y E R -> F and Y available.\n- ""HOMER"": H O M E R -> H and M available.\n- ""LOVER"": L O V E R -> L and V available.\n- ""MOVER"": M O V E R -> M and V available, but we know M and V not tried.\n- ""ROVER"": R O V E R -> but R is at position 1? But we have R at position 5, and if R is at position 1, it would be duplicate? But in POWER, R is at 5 and correct, so if we have R at 1, it might be duplicate? But we don\'t know if duplicate is allowed.\n\nBut in the first guess, CRANE had no duplicate, and secret word might have duplicates? But let\'s avoid for now.\n\n- ""TOWER"": T O W E R -> but W is absent (from POWER: W(x)), so invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""POWER"" we already guessed, P absent.\n\nSo possible words: ""BOXER"", ""FOYER"", ""HOMER"", ""LOVER"", ""MOVER"", ""ROVER"" (but R duplicate), ""SOWER"" S absent, etc.\n\n""TOTER"" T O T E R -> duplicate T? But T not tried.\n\nBut let\'s list without duplicates for simplicity.\n\n- ""BOXER"": B at1, X at3\n- ""FOYER"": F at1, Y at3\n- ""HOMER"": H at1, M at3\n- ""LOVER"": L at1, V at3\n- ""MOVER"": M at1, V at3\n\nWe need to choose one that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.\n\nSince we have to guess, we can pick one that tests frequent letters.\n\nFor example, T is a very common letter, but in the pattern, position 1 or 3 could be T.\n\nIs there a word like ""TOTER""? T O T E R -> positions: T at1, O at2, T at3, E at4, R at5. Duplicate T? But it\'s a valid word.\n\n""OTHER"": O T H E R -> but O is at position 2? ""OTHER"" is O T H E R, so position 1:O, but we need position 2:O, so position 1 must be different. ""OTHER"" has O at position 1, not 2. So not matching.\n\n""OTTER"" O T T E R -> O at position 1, not 2.\n\nNo word with T at position 1 and something at 3? Like ""TOKER"" not common.\n\n""TOWER"" has W absent.\n\nSo T might not be easy to fit.\n\nL is common: ""LOVER"" is a good word.\n\nSimilarly, M: ""MOVER"" or ""MOWER"" but W absent.\n\n""HOMER"" is a name, but acceptable.\n\n""BOXER"" is common.\n\nI think ""LOVER"" is a good choice because L and V are common.\n\nBut we can also consider that we have no information on L or V.\n\nSimilarly, ""HOVER"" is also good.\n\nBut ""HOVER"" has H and V.\n\nTo test two new letters, ""LOVER"" or ""HOVER"" are fine.\n\nI\'ll go with ""LOVER"": L at position 1, V at position 3.\n\nIf we guess ""LOVER"", we can get feedback on L and V.\n\nIf L is correct at position 1, we get ✓, else if present but wrong position, -, or absent x.\n\nSimilarly for V at position 3.\n\nAnd since O, E, R are fixed, they will be ✓.\n\nSo guess ""LOVER"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: L O V E R -> position 1:L, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R. Matches.\n\nAnd L and V are not in the absent list.\n\nSo it\'s a valid guess.\n\nTherefore, fourth guess: LOVER\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n- The secret word has O at position 2, E at position 4, and R at position 5.\n- The first and third positions are unknown and must be filled with letters not in the absent list (C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W).\n- ""LOVER"" is a common word that fits the pattern and tests L at position 1 and V at position 3.\n- Feedback will confirm or deny L and V, helping to solve the word.\n\n<guess>LOVER</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Correct positions confirmed:**\n  - Position 2: O (from POWER: O(✓))\n  - Position 4: E (from RIDES: E(✓) and POWER: E(✓))\n  - Position 5: R (from POWER: R(✓))\n- **Absent letters:** C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W (marked ""x"" in feedback).\n- **Secret word pattern:** The word must be _ O _ E R (unknown first and third positions).\n- **Available letters:** B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z (excluding absent letters).\n\nFor the fourth guess, I need to:\n- Test possible letters for positions 1 and 3.\n- Use common letters to maximize information.\n- Avoid absent letters.\n\nA strong guess is **LOVER**:\n- **L** at position 1: Tests a common consonant.\n- **V** at position 3: Tests a less common letter, helping to confirm or eliminate possibilities.\n- **O, E, R** are placed in their known correct positions (2, 4, 5) to validate the pattern.\n- This guess efficiently narrows down the remaining letters while fitting the established constraints.\n\n<guess>LOVER</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: RIDES -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: POWER -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 4: LOVER -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(✓) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from four guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: absent (x)\n- R: present, wrong position (-) [position 2]\n- A: absent (x)\n- N: absent (x)\n- E: present, wrong position (-) [position 5]\n\nGuess 2: RIDES\n- R: present, wrong position (-) [position 1]\n- I: absent (x)\n- D: absent (x)\n- E: correct position (✓) [position 4]\n- S: absent (x)\n\nGuess 3: POWER\n- P: absent (x)\n- O: correct position (✓) [position 2]\n- W: absent (x)\n- E: correct position (✓) [position 4]\n- R: correct position (✓) [position 5]\n\nGuess 4: LOVER\n- L: absent (x)\n- O: correct position (✓) [position 2]\n- V: absent (x)\n- E: correct position (✓) [position 4]\n- R: correct position (✓) [position 5]\n\nNow, we know:\n- The secret word has O at position 2, E at position 4, and R at position 5.

""GOFER"" is a word? Yes, meaning an employee who runs errands. G at1, F at3.\n- ""HOVER"" but V absent.\n- ""MOWER"" W absent.\n\nAlso, ""COMET"" but pattern not match.\n\nSo possible: ""HOMER"", ""BOXER"", ""FOYER"", ""JOKER"", ""GOFER"".\n\nWe need to guess one that might be the word or get information.\n\nBut since we have only two positions, and we know the pattern, we can guess one that uses common letters.\n\nCommon letters left: T, but no word with T? ""TOKER"" not common, ""TOTER"" T O T E R -> duplicate T? And T available.\n\n""TOTER"" is a word, meaning one who carries. T at1, T at3? Duplicate.\n\nBut we can consider.\n\nSimilarly, ""HOMER"" is quite common.\n\nSince we have multiple options, we should choose a word that tests letters that cover more possibilities.\n\nBut we have no prior on which letters are more likely, so any is fine.\n\nPerhaps ""HOMER"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback: in LOVER, L and V are absent, so we have more absent letters.\n\nNow, for the fifth guess, we can guess ""HOMER"".\n\nIf it\'s not, we get feedback on H and M.\n\nBut we have only 6 guesses, and this is guess 5.\n\nWe have two positions, so we might need two guesses, but we have two left.\n\nAfter this guess, we might solve or have one more.\n\nBut let\'s guess ""HOMER"".\n\nIf correct, we win.\n\nIf not, we get feedback on H and M.\n\nFor example, if H is absent, then we know position 1 is not H, and similarly for M.\n\nThen we can guess another word like ""BOXER"" or ""FOYER"".\n\nBut to save a guess, if we can.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nAnother idea: is there a word that uses more than one possible letter? No, because we have to fill specific positions.\n\nWe could guess a word that has a different letter at position 1 and 3 to test both.\n\nBut all options do that.\n\nI think ""HOMER"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nPerhaps ""TOWER"" but W absent, no.\n\n""BOWER"" W absent.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""HOMER"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: H and M are available, not absent.\n\nSo guess ""HOMER"".\n\nTherefore, fifth guess: HOMER\n\nStep-by-step:\n- Secret word pattern: _ O _ E R\n- Absent letters: C,A,N,I,D,S,P,W,L,V\n- Available: B,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,T,U,X,Y,Z\n- ""HOMER"" fits: H at position 1, M at position 3, with O,E,R fixed.\n- If correct, solved. If not, feedback on H and M will help for the final guess.\n\n<guess>HOMER</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Current Word Pattern from Feedback**:\n   - Position 2: **O** (confirmed correct in Guess 3 and 4).\n   - Position 4: **E** (confirmed correct in Guess 2, 3, and 4).\n   - Position 5: **R** (confirmed correct in Guess 3 and 4).\n   - The secret word pattern is: **? O ? E R** (unknown first and third positions).\n\n2. **Absent Letters**:\n   - From all feedback: **C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W, L, V** are absent (marked ""x"" in guesses).\n   - Available letters: **B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, X, Y, Z**.\n\n3. **Previous Guess Analysis**:\n   - Guess 4 (LOVER) eliminated **L** and **V**, confirming **O, E, R** positions.\n   - Only positions 1 and 3 remain unknown, with limited letters left.\n\n4. **Possible Words**:\n   - With the pattern **? O ? E R** and available letters, common English words include:\n     - **HOMER**: H at position 1, M at position 3.\n     - **BOXER**: B at position 1, X at position 3.\n     - **FOYER**: F at position 1, Y at position 3.\n     - **JOKER**: J at position 1, K at position 3.\n     - **GOFER**: G at position 1, F at position 3.\n     - **TOTER**: T at position 1, T at position 3 (duplicate T, but valid).\n\n5. **Strategy for Guess 5**:\n   - **HOMER** is chosen because:\n     - **H** and **M** are high-frequency consonants not yet tested.\n     - It tests two new letters at once, maximizing information if incorrect.\n     - If correct, the game is solved. If not, feedback on **H** and **M** (absent or position) will pinpoint the solution with the final guess.\n   - Other options like BOXER or FOYER are less common, and TOTER has a duplicate letter, which is less likely.\n\n6. **Risk Consideration**:\n   - With only 2 guesses left (this is Guess 5), **HOMER** is efficient—it either wins or provides clear feedback for Guess 6.\n   - If **H** or **M** is absent, we eliminate them and focus on other options (e.g., BOXER, FOYER) next.\n\n<guess>HOMER</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: RIDES -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: POWER -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 4: LOVER -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(✓) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 5: HOMER -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) M(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback for five guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE → C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
Interpretation: C, A, N absent. R present but not in position 2. E present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: RIDES → R(-), I(x), D(x), E(✓), S(x)  
Interpretation: I, D, S absent. E correct at position 4 (since E was guessed at position 4). R present but not in position 1.

Guess 3: POWER → P(x), O(✓), W(x), E(✓), R(✓)  
Interpretation: P, W absent. O correct at position 2. E correct at position 4 (confirmed). R correct at position 5.

Guess 4: LOVER → L(x), O(✓), V(x), E(✓), R(✓)  
Interpretation: L, V absent. O, E, R confirmed in positions 2, 4, 5.

Guess 5: HOMER → H(x), O(✓), M(x), E(✓), R(✓)  
Interpretation: H, M absent. O, E, R confirmed.

What we know:
- **Secret word pattern**: Positions: 
  - Position 1: Unknown (first letter)
  - Position 2: O
  - Position 3: Unknown (third letter)
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: R
  So the word is: ? O ? E R

- **Confirmed absent letters**: C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W, L, V, H, M  
  (All marked ""x"" across guesses)

- **Available letters** (not absent and not yet tried): B, F, G, J, K, Q, T, U, X, Y, Z  
  (Since O, E, R are confirmed in the word but already placed correctly, we focus on filling positions 1 and 3 from unused letters.)

Possible words fitting ? O ? E R with available letters:
1. **BOXER**: B at 1, X at 3  
   Letters: B, O, X, E, R → B and X are available.
2. **FOYER**: F at 1, Y at 3  
   Letters: F, O, Y, E, R → F and Y available.
3. **JOKER**: J at 1, K at 3  
   Letters: J, O, K, E, R → J and K available.
4. **GOFER**: G at 1, F at 3  
   Letters: G, O, F, E, R → G and F available.
5. **TOWER**: Not possible (W absent).
6. **TOTER**: T at 1, T at 3 (duplicate T)  
   Letters: T, O, T, E, R → T available.

Strategy for Guess 6 (last guess):
- We have one guess left and multiple possibilities, so we prioritize the most common word.
- **BOXER** and **FOYER** are strong candidates. ""FOYER"" is a common word in English (entry hall), and ""BOXER"" is also common (type of dog).
- Choose **FOYER** to test:
  - It uses F and Y, both unused and frequent.
  - If incorrect, feedback will confirm if F or Y are present/absent, but since we need to fill positions and have no more guesses, we must guess one of the options.
- Alternatively, we could consider letter frequency, but with so few choices, it's best to pick a plausible word.

Let's choose **FOYER**. It is a valid 5-letter word, fits the pattern, and uses available letters.

If ""FOYER"" is not the word, the correct answer must be one of the others (like BOXER), but we won't get another chance. However, based on commonality, FOYER is a good choice.

Final decision: Guess **FOYER**.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Current Word Pattern from Feedback**:
   - Position 2: **O** (confirmed correct in Guesses 3–5).
   - Position 4: **E** (confirmed correct in Guesses 2–5).
   - Position 5: **R** (confirmed correct in Guesses 3–5).
   - The secret word pattern is: **? O ? E R** (first and third positions unknown).

2. **Absent Letters**:
   - From all feedback: **C, A, N, I, D, S, P, W, L, V, H, M** are absent (marked ""x"" in guesses).
   - Available letters for positions 1 and 3: **B, F, G, J, K, Q, T, U, X, Y, Z**.

3. **Possible Words**:
   - With the pattern **? O ? E R** and available letters, valid English words include:
     - **FOYER**: F at position 1, Y at position 3 (common word for an entrance hall).
     - **BOXER**: B at position 1, X at position 3 (common word for a dog breed or fighter).
     - **JOKER**: J at position 1, K at position 3 (common word for a trickster).
     - **GOFER**: G at position 1, F at position 3 (less common, meaning an errand runner).
     - **TOTER**: T at position 1, T at position 3 (duplicate T, valid but less likely).
     - **ZONER**: Not a standard word; unreliable.

4. **Strategy for Guess 6 (Final Guess)**:
   - **FOYER** is prioritized because:
     - **F** and **Y** are high-frequency untested letters, making it a plausible solution.
     - It avoids duplicates or obscure words (e.g., FOYER is more common than GOFER).
     - If incorrect, feedback is irrelevant as this is the last guess, so we aim for the most likely word.
   - Alternative options like BOXER or JOKER are viable but less optimal due to lower frequency in everyday language.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - After eliminating all absent letters and using logic from feedback, **FOYER** aligns with the pattern, available letters, and common usage.
