We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(✓), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(✓)

 Interpretation:
 - C is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
 - R is in the word but not in position 2 (it's in the word elsewhere).
 - A is in the word but not in position 3 (it's in the word elsewhere).
 - N is not in the word at all.
 - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

 So, we know:
 - The first letter is C and the fifth letter is E. So the word is of the form: C _ _ _ E
 - The word contains R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively (and also not in position 1 or 5 because those are taken by C and E).
 - The letter N is absent.

 We also know that the word does not contain N.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should try to find a word that:
 1. Starts with C and ends with E (to confirm the fixed positions, but actually we already know they are fixed, so we can use them to test other positions).
 2. Includes R and A in positions that are not 2 and 3 (and not 1 or 5) and also not in the same positions as the first guess (because we know they were wrong there).

 However, note that in the first guess, R was in position 2 and A in position 3, and they were marked as present but in the wrong position. So they must appear in the word in positions 4, or possibly 2 and 3 are not the only positions? Actually, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

 We know:
 - Position 1: C (fixed)
 - Position 5: E (fixed)
 - The word has R and A, but not in position 2 or 3? Actually, the feedback for R was at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. Similarly, A was at position 3 and marked as present but wrong position.

 So R must be in position 3 or 4? But wait, position 3 was A and it was wrong, so R cannot be in position 2 (because that's where we put it and it was wrong) and similarly A cannot be in position 3. Also, R and A cannot be in position 1 or 5 because those are fixed to C and E.

 Therefore, the only positions left for R and A are 3 and 4? Actually, position 3 is available for R? But note: we had A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't prevent R from being in position 3? Actually, no: because the feedback for R was at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong, meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. Similarly, A is in the word but not at position 3.

 So R must be in position 3 or 4? And A must be in position 2 or 4? But note: we have two letters to place: R and A, and two positions: 2, 3, and 4. However, we cannot put both in the same position. So we have to consider:

 Possibilities for R: position 3 or 4 (because position 2 is excluded by the feedback, and 1 and 5 are fixed and not R).
 Possibilities for A: position 2 or 4 (because position 3 is excluded, and 1 and 5 are fixed and not A).

 But note: if we put R in position 4, then A can be in position 2 or 3? But wait, position 3 is excluded for A. So A can only be in position 2 or 4. Similarly, R can be in position 3 or 4.

 However, we must also consider that the same letter might not appear twice? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, but we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Since the feedback for the first guess didn't show any duplicate, and we only have one R and one A in the guess, we assume the word has at least one R and one A.

 But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. However, without evidence of duplicates, we can assume that R and A are single.

 So the two letters R and A must be placed in two of the three positions: 2, 3, 4? But actually, we have two positions to fill: 2, 3, and 4, but we have two letters. However, we have constraints:

 - R cannot be in 2 -> so R must be in 3 or 4.
 - A cannot be in 3 -> so A must be in 2 or 4.

 And they cannot be in the same position. So the possibilities:

 Option 1: R in 3 and A in 2 -> word: C A R _ E
 Option 2: R in 3 and A in 4 -> word: C _ R A E
 Option 3: R in 4 and A in 2 -> word: C A _ R E
 Option 4: R in 4 and A in 4 -> not possible (same position)

 So we have three possibilities for the structure:

 1. C A R _ E
 2. C _ R A E
 3. C A _ R E

 We also know that the word does not contain N (and we know that from the first guess, N was absent).

 Now, we need to choose a word that will help us distinguish between these possibilities and also reveal the missing letter.

 The missing letter is the one in the blank. We have to consider that the blank could be any letter (except N, and also excluding C, R, A, E because they are already present? But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but we haven't seen duplicates so far. So we avoid duplicates for now.

 However, we must also consider that the word might have more than one of a letter? But without evidence, we assume no duplicates for now.

 So the missing letter is a new letter that we haven't tried yet? We have tried: C, R, A, N, E. So we know N is absent. The missing letter must be a letter that is not C, R, A, E, and not N.

 We have 21 letters left (the alphabet minus C, R, A, E, N).

 But we also want to test the positions of R and A.

 How can we design a guess that will help us distinguish between the three structures?

 We can try to use a word that has:

 - C at the start and E at the end (to keep the fixed letters).
 - We want to test the positions for R and A and also the unknown letter.

 However, note: we are allowed to use any 5-letter word, not necessarily one that fits the fixed C and E? But using the fixed letters might help us get more information about the middle.

 But we already know C and E are fixed, so we should keep them to get more information about the middle.

 So let's form a word that has:

 - First letter: C
 - Fifth letter: E
 - And then we choose the middle three letters to test the possibilities.

 We have three structures to test. We can try to cover as many possibilities as possible.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has A and R in positions that would be consistent with only one of the structures.

 For example, if we try a word that has A in position 2 and R in position 3, that would be consistent with structure 1 (C A R _ E). But if we get feedback that A is in the correct position (if the word is structure 1) then we know. Similarly, if we try a word that has A in position 4 and R in position 3, that would be consistent with structure 2.

 However, we don't know which structure it is, so we can choose a word that has A and R in positions that are not overlapping with the possibilities? Actually, we can choose a word that has A and R in positions that we haven't tried for them.

 But note: we have already tried R in position 2 (which was wrong) and A in position 3 (which was wrong). So we want to try R in a new position (either 3 or 4) and A in a new position (either 2 or 4).

 We can try to put R in position 3 and A in position 4? That would be:

 Word: C _ R A E

 But we don't know the second letter. We can choose a letter for the second position that is common and not N.

 Similarly, we can try to put A in position 2 and R in position 4: C A _ R E.

 But we don't know the third letter.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses one of the structures and a common letter for the blank.

 However, we have three possibilities. We can try to eliminate two at once.

 Let me list the three possibilities:

 Possibility 1: C A R X E  (where X is the unknown letter, not N and not C,R,A,E)
 Possibility 2: C X R A E  (X is the unknown letter, same constraints)
 Possibility 3: C A X R E  (X is the unknown letter)

 We can try a word that is in one of these forms? But we don't know which one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has:

 - C at 1, E at 5
 - A in position 2 and R in position 4? That would be: C A ? R E

 This word would be consistent with possibility 3 (if the ? is the same as the unknown in possibility 3) but not with possibility 1 or 2.

 How?

 - If the secret word is possibility 1 (C A R X E), then our guess C A ? R E would have:
   - C: correct (position 1)
   - A: correct (position 2) -> because in the secret word A is at position 2? Actually, in possibility 1, the secret word is C A R X E, so A is at position 2. So if we guess C A ? R E, then:
        Position 1: C -> ✓
        Position 2: A -> ✓ (if the secret is possibility 1, then A is at 2, so correct)
        Position 3: ? -> we don't know, but in the secret (possibility 1) it's R, so if we put a letter there, it would be compared to R.
        Position 4: R -> in the secret (possibility 1) the fourth letter is X (which is not R, because R is at position 3). So R in our guess at position 4 would be compared to X (which is not R). So R would be marked as absent? But wait, the secret word has R at position 3, so R is present but not at position 4. So the feedback for R would be: present but wrong position? But note: we already have an R in the word (at position 4) and the secret has one R at position 3. So the feedback for R would be: we have one R in the guess and one in the secret, so the R at position 4 would be marked as present but wrong position? But also, we have the A at position 2 which is correct.

 However, we are trying to get information about the structure.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't commit to one structure but tests multiple.

 Another idea: use a word that has the letter R in position 3 and A in position 4? That would be: C ? R A E.

 This would be consistent with possibility 2 (C X R A E) if the ? is the same as X.

 But if the secret is possibility 1 (C A R X E), then our guess C ? R A E would have:
   - C: ✓
   - ? at position 2: if the secret has A at position 2, then if we put a letter that is not A, then the A in our guess is at position 4? But wait, we have A at position 4. In the secret, A is at position 2, so the A in our guess at position 4 would be compared to the secret's fourth letter (which is X, not A). So the A would be marked as absent? But the secret has an A at position 2, so the A in our guess at position 4 should be marked as present but wrong position? Because the secret has an A that we haven't accounted for? 

 Actually, the feedback for the first guess told us that A is in the word but not at position 3. So in the secret, A is at position 2 or 4? But in possibility 1, it's at 2, and in possibility 2, it's at 4. In possibility 3, it's at 2.

 So if we guess C ? R A E:

 - If the secret is possibility 1 (C A R X E):
   - Position 1: C -> ✓
   - Position 2: ? (let's say we use a letter, say B) -> compared to A (secret position 2): if B != A, then B is not in the word? Or if it is, but we don't know. Actually, we are using a new letter for position 2.
   - Position 3: R -> compared to R (secret position 3): ✓
   - Position 4: A -> compared to X (secret position 4): but the secret has A at position 2, so the A in our guess at position 4 is not in the secret? Actually, the secret has only one A (at position 2) and we haven't guessed that A yet? But we have an A in the guess at position 4. The secret has an A at position 2, so the A in the guess is present but should be marked as wrong position? But note: the secret's A at position 2 has not been matched by our guess (because we have a different letter at position 2). So the feedback for A at position 4 would be: present but wrong position? Because the secret has an A that we haven't found in the correct position.

 However, the feedback system: it will mark the A at position 4 as present but wrong position? Because the secret has an A that is not at position 4? And we haven't used an A in the correct position (position 2) in this guess.

 But if we use a word that has A at position 4, and the secret has A at position 2, then the A is present but in the wrong position.

 Similarly, if the secret is possibility 2 (C X R A E), then our guess C ? R A E would have:
   - C: ✓
   - ? at position 2: compared to X (if we choose the same letter as X, then ✓, otherwise if not, then if the letter is in the word it might be marked as present, but we don't know X)
   - R at position 3: ✓ (because secret has R at 3)
   - A at position 4: ✓ (because secret has A at 4)

 So if the secret is possibility 2, then we would get two more correct letters (R at 3 and A at 4) and the second letter might be correct if we guessed it.

 But we don't know the second letter. So we can choose a common letter for the second position.

 Similarly, if the secret is possibility 3 (C A X R E), then our guess C ? R A E would have:
   - C: ✓
   - ? at position 2: compared to A (secret position 2) -> if we put a letter that is not A, then it would be marked as absent (if the letter is not in the word) or present but wrong (if the letter is elsewhere). But the secret has A at position 2, so if we don't guess A at position 2, then the A we have at position 4 would be compared to the secret's position 4 which is R (not A). So the A in our guess would be marked as present but wrong position? Because the secret has an A at position 2 that we haven't matched.

 However, we are not using A at position 2, so the A at position 4 would be the only A in the guess and it would match the A in the secret (but at position 2) so it would be marked as present but wrong position.

 And the R at position 3: in the secret (possibility 3) the R is at position 4, so the R at position 3 in our guess would be compared to the secret's position 3 which is X (not R). So R would be marked as present but wrong position? Because the secret has an R at position 4.

 So in summary, for the guess C ? R A E:

 - If the secret is possibility 1 (C A R X E):
   - We get: C(✓), [letter at 2: if it's A then ✓, but we are not using A at 2? We are using an unknown letter. Let me assume we use a letter that is not A and not in the word, then: 
        Position 1: ✓
        Position 2: x (if the letter is not in the word) or - (if it is elsewhere, but we don't know)
        Position 3: ✓ (because R is at 3 in the secret)
        Position 4: - (because A is in the word but at position 2, so we mark A at 4 as present but wrong)
        Position 5: ✓

   But note: we have two fixed letters (C and E) and we know they are fixed, so we can focus on the middle.

 - If the secret is possibility 2 (C X R A E):
   - We get: 
        Position 1: ✓
        Position 2: if we guessed X, then ✓, else if we guessed a letter not in the word: x, or if in the word but not at 2: -
        Position 3: ✓
        Position 4: ✓
        Position 5: ✓

   So we would get at least three checks (if we didn't guess the second letter correctly) and if we did, then four.

 - If the secret is possibility 3 (C A X R E):
   - We get:
        Position 1: ✓
        Position 2: if we guessed a letter that is not A and not in the word: x (because the secret has A at 2, but we didn't guess it, and if our letter is not in the word, then x)
        Position 3: R -> but the secret has X at 3 (which is not R) and R is at 4, so R is present but not at 3 -> so -
        Position 4: A -> the secret has R at 4, so A is not at 4. But the secret has A at 2, so A is present but not at 4 -> so -
        Position 5: ✓

   So we would get: ✓, x, -, -, ✓

 This seems messy because the feedback for the second letter and the third and fourth depend on what we choose and what the secret is.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't use R and A in the middle, but uses new letters? But we know the word has R and A, so we must include them? Actually, we don't have to include them, but if we don't, we might not get information about their positions.

 However, we can use a word that has the fixed C and E, and then uses three new letters to test the middle positions. But we know the word has R and A, so if we don't include R and A, then we might get feedback that R and A are present? But we already know they are present. We need to find their positions.

 So we must include R and A in the guess? But we can put them in positions that we haven't tried.

 Let me try to form a word for possibility 2: C ? R A E. We can choose a common letter for the second position, like 'L'. So the word would be ""CLRAE"" — but is that a word? No, because it's not a valid English word.

 Similarly, for possibility 3: C A ? R E, we can try ""CATER"" — that is a word.

 But note: we are constrained by valid English words.

 So we need to choose a valid English word that starts with C and ends with E, and includes R and A in positions 2,3, or 4.

 Let me think of words that start with C and end with E:

 - crate: C R A T E -> but we have fixed C and E, and then R at position 2, A at position 3? But we know from the first guess that R cannot be at position 2 (because we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong). So crate would have R at position 2, which we know is wrong. So we shouldn't put R at position 2.

 Similarly, we cannot put A at position 3.

 So we need a word that has:

 - C at 1, E at 5
 - R not at 2, A not at 3.

 And the word must be valid.

 Let me list some words:

 - cable: C A B L E -> has A at position 2 (which is allowed) and no R? But we know the word has R, so we must include R? Actually, we don't have to include R in this guess, but then we won't get information about R's position. We can include R in a later guess.

 However, we have limited guesses (6 total). So we should try to get as much information as possible.

 We can try a word that has R in position 3 or 4 and A in position 2 or 4.

 Example words:

 - carve: C A R V E -> has A at 2 and R at 3. This fits possibility 1: C A R ? E. But we don't know the fourth letter. And carve is a word.

 - carex: not common, but carex is a word? It's a genus of plants. But let's stick to common words.

 - carle: not common.

 - carpe: not a word.

 - carte: C A R T E -> but we know the fifth letter is E, so that's fine. But again, R is at position 3 and A at 2.

 So carve and carte are words that fit the pattern C A R ? E.

 But we also want to test other structures.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A at position 4 and R at position 3: like C ? R A E. What words? 

 - crease: too long, we need 5 letters.

 - crate: but R at 2 is not allowed.

 - crane: we already used.

 - crave: C R A V E -> but R is at position 2, which is not allowed.

 - grace: but it doesn't start with C? It starts with G.

 We need to start with C.

 - corea: not common, and it ends with A, not E.

 - corae: not a word.

 - ceria: not ending with E.

 It's hard to find a word of the form C ? R A E.

 What about C ? R ? E, but we need to include A somewhere? We don't have to include A in this guess? But we know the word has A, so if we don't include A, then the feedback will show that A is still present (but we already know that). We are more interested in the position.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4 and R in position 4? Not possible.

 Another idea: try a word that has R in position 4 and A in position 2: C A ? R E.

 Words: 
 - cater: C A T E R -> but it ends with R, not E. We need to end with E.

 - caper: C A P E R -> ends with R.

 - caner: C A N E R -> but we know N is not in the word, so we cannot use N.

 - carer: has R at 4, but duplicate R and ends with R.

 - cager: C A G E R -> ends with R.

 It's difficult to find a word ending with E that has the pattern C A ? R E.

 How about ""cadre""? C A D R E -> that's a word! And it ends with E.

 So ""cadre"" has:
   - C at 1
   - A at 2
   - D at 3
   - R at 4
   - E at 5

 This fits the pattern of possibility 3: C A X R E (with X being D).

 But we are not sure if the secret word has this structure.

 However, by guessing ""cadre"", we can test:

 - If the secret is possibility 1 (C A R X E), then the feedback for ""cadre"" would be:
      C: ✓
      A: ✓ (because in possibility 1, A is at position 2)
      D: compared to R (secret position 3) -> D is not in the word? So x
      R: compared to X (secret position 4) -> but the secret has R at position 3, so the R in our guess at position 4 would be compared to the secret's position 4 (which is X). If X is not R, then R would be marked as present but wrong position? Because the secret has an R at position 3 that we haven't matched? But we have an R in the guess at position 4. So the feedback for R would be: present but wrong position? And the secret has only one R? We don't know, but we haven't seen duplicate feedback.

 - If the secret is possibility 2 (C X R A E), then the feedback for ""cadre"" would be:
      C: ✓
      A: at position 2 -> compared to the secret's position 2 which is X (not A, because in possibility 2, A is at position 4). So A would be marked as present but wrong position? Because the secret has an A at position 4.
      D: compared to R (secret position 3) -> D is not R, and if D is not in the word, then x
      R: compared to A (secret position 4) -> R is not A, and if R is not in the secret elsewhere? But the secret has R at position 3, so R is present but we have it at position 4? So R would be marked as present but wrong position? 
      E: ✓

 - If the secret is possibility 3 (C A X R E), then the feedback for ""cadre"" would be:
      C: ✓
      A: ✓ (because secret has A at position 2)
      D: compared to X (secret position 3) -> if the secret's third letter is D, then ✓, else if not, then if D is in the word elsewhere? But we don't know. If not, then x.
      R: compared to R (secret position 4) -> ✓
      E: ✓

 So if the secret is possibility 3, we would get: ✓ ✓ (if D matches) ✓ ✓ ✓, or if D doesn't match then ✓ ✓ x ✓ ✓.

 But we don't know the third letter in possibility 3.

 Given that, ""cadre"" is a good candidate because:

 - It is a valid English word.
 - It has the fixed C and E.
 - It has A in position 2 (which is a candidate position for A) and R in position 4 (a candidate position for R).

 And it will help us distinguish:

 - If we get A at position 2 correct and R at position 4 correct, then it must be possibility 3 and the third letter must be D? But wait, we are guessing D at position 3. If the secret is possibility 3 and the third letter is not D, then we get x for D, but we still know the structure is C A ? R E and we can find the missing letter later.

 - If we get A correct at 2 but R not correct at 4 (but present elsewhere), then it might be possibility 1.

 - If we get A not correct at 2 (but present) and R not correct at 4 (but present), then it might be possibility 2.

 So we can learn a lot.

 But note: we are not sure about the third letter, but we can get feedback on D.

 Also, we know the word doesn't have N, so D is a new letter.

 Let's go with ""cadre"".

 So our second guess: ""cadre""

<guess>cadre</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where C(✓), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(✓), we know:
- The secret word starts with C and ends with E: C _ _ _ E
- R is in the word but not in position 2
- A is in the word but not in position 3
- N is absent

The possible structures for the secret word are:
1. C A R _ E (A at position 2, R at position 3)
2. C _ R A E (R at position 3, A at position 4)
3. C A _ R E (A at position 2, R at position 4)

For the second guess, ""cadre"" is chosen because:
- It starts with C and ends with E to maintain fixed positions
- It tests A in position 2 and R in position 4 (aligning with possibility 3)
- It introduces ""D"" in position 3 as a new letter probe
- It is a valid English word

This guess will help distinguish between the structures:
- If A and R are both correct, it supports possibility 3 (C A _ R E)
- If A is correct but R is misplaced, it suggests possibility 1 (C A R _ E)
- If A is misplaced and R is correct, it suggests possibility 2 (C _ R A E)
- Feedback on ""D"" will reveal if it's in the word or not

<guess>cadre</guess>",cadre,"We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(✓), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(✓)

 Interpretation:
 - C is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
 - R is in the word but not in position 2 (it's in the word elsewhere).
 - A is in the word but not in position 3 (it's in the word elsewhere).
 - N is not in the word at all.
 - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

 So, we know:
 - The first letter is C and the fifth letter is E. So the word is of the form: C _ _ _ E
 - The word contains R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively (and also not in position 1 or 5 because those are taken by C and E).
 - The letter N is absent.

 We also know that the word does not contain N.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should try to find a word that:
 1. Starts with C and ends with E (to confirm the fixed positions, but actually we already know they are fixed, so we can use them to test other positions).
 2. Includes R and A in positions that are not 2 and 3 (and not 1 or 5) and also not in the same positions as the first guess (because we know they were wrong there).

 However, note that in the first guess, R was in position 2 and A in position 3, and they were marked as present but in the wrong position. So they must appear in the word in positions 4, or possibly 2 and 3 are not the only positions? Actually, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

 We know:
 - Position 1: C (fixed)
 - Position 5: E (fixed)
 - The word has R and A, but not in position 2 or 3? Actually, the feedback for R was at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. Similarly, A was at position 3 and marked as present but wrong position.

 So R must be in position 3 or 4? But wait, position 3 was A and it was wrong, so R cannot be in position 2 (because that's where we put it and it was wrong) and similarly A cannot be in position 3. Also, R and A cannot be in position 1 or 5 because those are fixed to C and E.

 Therefore, the only positions left for R and A are 3 and 4? Actually, position 3 is available for R? But note: we had A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't prevent R from being in position 3? Actually, no: because the feedback for R was at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong, meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. Similarly, A is in the word but not at position 3.

 So R must be in position 3 or 4? And A must be in position 2 or 4? But note: we have two letters to place: R and A, and two positions: 2, 3, and 4. However, we cannot put both in the same position. So we have to consider:

 Possibilities for R: position 3 or 4 (because position 2 is excluded by the feedback, and 1 and 5 are fixed and not R).
 Possibilities for A: position 2 or 4 (because position 3 is excluded, and 1 and 5 are fixed and not A).

 But note: if we put R in position 4, then A can be in position 2 or 3? But wait, position 3 is excluded for A. So A can only be in position 2 or 4. Similarly, R can be in position 3 or 4.

 However, we must also consider that the same letter might not appear twice? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, but we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Since the feedback for the first guess didn't show any duplicate, and we only have one R and one A in the guess, we assume the word has at least one R and one A.

 But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. However, without evidence of duplicates, we can assume that R and A are single.

 So the two letters R and A must be placed in two of the three positions: 2, 3, 4? But actually, we have two positions to fill: 2, 3, and 4, but we have two letters. However, we have constraints:

 - R cannot be in 2 -> so R must be in 3 or 4.
 - A cannot be in 3 -> so A must be in 2 or 4.

 And they cannot be in the same position. So the possibilities:

 Option 1: R in 3 and A in 2 -> word: C A R _ E
 Option 2: R in 3 and A in 4 -> word: C _ R A E
 Option 3: R in 4 and A in 2 -> word: C A _ R E
 Option 4: R in 4 and A in 4 -> not possible (same position)

 So we have three possibilities for the structure:

 1. C A R _ E
 2. C _ R A E
 3. C A _ R E

 We also know that the word does not contain N (and we know that from the first guess, N was absent).

 Now, we need to choose a word that will help us distinguish between these possibilities and also reveal the missing letter.

 The missing letter is the one in the blank. We have to consider that the blank could be any letter (except N, and also excluding C, R, A, E because they are already present? But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but we haven't seen duplicates so far. So we avoid duplicates for now.

 However, we must also consider that the word might have more than one of a letter? But without evidence, we assume no duplicates for now.

 So the missing letter is a new letter that we haven't tried yet? We have tried: C, R, A, N, E. So we know N is absent. The missing letter must be a letter that is not C, R, A, E, and not N.

 We have 21 letters left (the alphabet minus C, R, A, E, N).

 But we also want to test the positions of R and A.

 How can we design a guess that will help us distinguish between the three structures?

 We can try to use a word that has:

 - C at the start and E at the end (to keep the fixed letters).
 - We want to test the positions for R and A and also the unknown letter.

 However, note: we are allowed to use any 5-letter word, not necessarily one that fits the fixed C and E? But using the fixed letters might help us get more information about the middle.

 But we already know C and E are fixed, so we should keep them to get more information about the middle.

 So let's form a word that has:

 - First letter: C
 - Fifth letter: E
 - And then we choose the middle three letters to test the possibilities.

 We have three structures to test. We can try to cover as many possibilities as possible.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has A and R in positions that would be consistent with only one of the structures.

 For example, if we try a word that has A in position 2 and R in position 3, that would be consistent with structure 1 (C A R _ E). But if we get feedback that A is in the correct position (if the word is structure 1) then we know. Similarly, if we try a word that has A in position 4 and R in position 3, that would be consistent with structure 2.

 However, we don't know which structure it is, so we can choose a word that has A and R in positions that are not overlapping with the possibilities? Actually, we can choose a word that has A and R in positions that we haven't tried for them.

 But note: we have already tried R in position 2 (which was wrong) and A in position 3 (which was wrong). So we want to try R in a new position (either 3 or 4) and A in a new position (either 2 or 4).

 We can try to put R in position 3 and A in position 4? That would be:

 Word: C _ R A E

 But we don't know the second letter. We can choose a letter for the second position that is common and not N.

 Similarly, we can try to put A in position 2 and R in position 4: C A _ R E.

 But we don't know the third letter.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses one of the structures and a common letter for the blank.

 However, we have three possibilities. We can try to eliminate two at once.

 Let me list the three possibilities:

 Possibility 1: C A R X E  (where X is the unknown letter, not N and not C,R,A,E)
 Possibility 2: C X R A E  (X is the unknown letter, same constraints)
 Possibility 3: C A X R E  (X is the unknown letter)

 We can try a word that is in one of these forms? But we don't know which one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has:

 - C at 1, E at 5
 - A in position 2 and R in position 4? That would be: C A ? R E

 This word would be consistent with possibility 3 (if the ? is the same as the unknown in possibility 3) but not with possibility 1 or 2.

 How?

 - If the secret word is possibility 1 (C A R X E), then our guess C A ? R E would have:
   - C: correct (position 1)
   - A: correct (position 2) -> because in the secret word A is at position 2? Actually, in possibility 1, the secret word is C A R X E, so A is at position 2. So if we guess C A ? R E, then:
        Position 1: C -> ✓
        Position 2: A -> ✓ (if the secret is possibility 1, then A is at 2, so correct)
        Position 3: ? -> we don't know, but in the secret (possibility 1) it's R, so if we put a letter there, it would be compared to R.
        Position 4: R -> in the secret (possibility 1) the fourth letter is X (which is not R, because R is at position 3). So R in our guess at position 4 would be compared to X (which is not R). So R would be marked as absent? But wait, the secret word has R at position 3, so R is present but not at position 4. So the feedback for R would be: present but wrong position? But note: we already have an R in the word (at position 4) and the secret has one R at position 3. So the feedback for R would be: we have one R in the guess and one in the secret, so the R at position 4 would be marked as present but wrong position? But also, we have the A at position 2 which is correct.

 However, we are trying to get information about the structure.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't commit to one structure but tests multiple.

 Another idea: use a word that has the letter R in position 3 and A in position 4? That would be: C ? R A E.

 This would be consistent with possibility 2 (C X R A E) if the ? is the same as X.

 But if the secret is possibility 1 (C A R X E), then our guess C ? R A E would have:
   - C: ✓
   - ? at position 2: if the secret has A at position 2, then if we put a letter that is not A, then the A in our guess is at position 4? But wait, we have A at position 4. In the secret, A is at position 2, so the A in our guess at position 4 would be compared to the secret's fourth letter (which is X, not A). So the A would be marked as absent? But the secret has an A at position 2, so the A in our guess at position 4 should be marked as present but wrong position? Because the secret has an A that we haven't accounted for? 

 Actually, the feedback for the first guess told us that A is in the word but not at position 3. So in the secret, A is at position 2 or 4? But in possibility 1, it's at 2, and in possibility 2, it's at 4. In possibility 3, it's at 2.

 So if we guess C ? R A E:

 - If the secret is possibility 1 (C A R X E):
   - Position 1: C -> ✓
   - Position 2: ? (let's say we use a letter, say B) -> compared to A (secret position 2): if B != A, then B is not in the word? Or if it is, but we don't know. Actually, we are using a new letter for position 2.
   - Position 3: R -> compared to R (secret position 3): ✓
   - Position 4: A -> compared to X (secret position 4): but the secret has A at position 2, so the A in our guess at position 4 is not in the secret? Actually, the secret has only one A (at position 2) and we haven't guessed that A yet? But we have an A in the guess at position 4. The secret has an A at position 2, so the A in the guess is present but should be marked as wrong position? But note: the secret's A at position 2 has not been matched by our guess (because we have a different letter at position 2). So the feedback for A at position 4 would be: present but wrong position? Because the secret has an A that we haven't found in the correct position.

 However, the feedback system: it will mark the A at position 4 as present but wrong position? Because the secret has an A that is not at position 4? And we haven't used an A in the correct position (position 2) in this guess.

 But if we use a word that has A at position 4, and the secret has A at position 2, then the A is present but in the wrong position.

 Similarly, if the secret is possibility 2 (C X R A E), then our guess C ? R A E would have:
   - C: ✓
   - ? at position 2: compared to X (if we choose the same letter as X, then ✓, otherwise if not, then if the letter is in the word it might be marked as present, but we don't know X)
   - R at position 3: ✓ (because secret has R at 3)
   - A at position 4: ✓ (because secret has A at 4)

 So if the secret is possibility 2, then we would get two more correct letters (R at 3 and A at 4) and the second letter might be correct if we guessed it.

 But we don't know the second letter. So we can choose a common letter for the second position.

 Similarly, if the secret is possibility 3 (C A X R E), then our guess C ? R A E would have:
   - C: ✓
   - ? at position 2: compared to A (secret position 2) -> if we put a letter that is not A, then it would be marked as absent (if the letter is not in the word) or present but wrong (if the letter is elsewhere). But the secret has A at position 2, so if we don't guess A at position 2, then the A we have at position 4 would be compared to the secret's position 4 which is R (not A). So the A in our guess would be marked as present but wrong position? Because the secret has an A at position 2 that we haven't matched.

 However, we are not using A at position 2, so the A at position 4 would be the only A in the guess and it would match the A in the secret (but at position 2) so it would be marked as present but wrong position.

 And the R at position 3: in the secret (possibility 3) the R is at position 4, so the R at position 3 in our guess would be compared to the secret's position 3 which is X (not R). So R would be marked as present but wrong position? Because the secret has an R at position 4.

 So in summary, for the guess C ? R A E:

 - If the secret is possibility 1 (C A R X E):
   - We get: C(✓), [letter at 2: if it's A then ✓, but we are not using A at 2? We are using an unknown letter. Let me assume we use a letter that is not A and not in the word, then: 
        Position 1: ✓
        Position 2: x (if the letter is not in the word) or - (if it is elsewhere, but we don't know)
        Position 3: ✓ (because R is at 3 in the secret)
        Position 4: - (because A is in the word but at position 2, so we mark A at 4 as present but wrong)
        Position 5: ✓

   But note: we have two fixed letters (C and E) and we know they are fixed, so we can focus on the middle.

 - If the secret is possibility 2 (C X R A E):
   - We get: 
        Position 1: ✓
        Position 2: if we guessed X, then ✓, else if we guessed a letter not in the word: x, or if in the word but not at 2: -
        Position 3: ✓
        Position 4: ✓
        Position 5: ✓

   So we would get at least three checks (if we didn't guess the second letter correctly) and if we did, then four.

 - If the secret is possibility 3 (C A X R E):
   - We get:
        Position 1: ✓
        Position 2: if we guessed a letter that is not A and not in the word: x (because the secret has A at 2, but we didn't guess it, and if our letter is not in the word, then x)
        Position 3: R -> but the secret has X at 3 (which is not R) and R is at 4, so R is present but not at 3 -> so -
        Position 4: A -> the secret has R at 4, so A is not at 4. But the secret has A at 2, so A is present but not at 4 -> so -
        Position 5: ✓

   So we would get: ✓, x, -, -, ✓

 This seems messy because the feedback for the second letter and the third and fourth depend on what we choose and what the secret is.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't use R and A in the middle, but uses new letters? But we know the word has R and A, so we must include them? Actually, we don't have to include them, but if we don't, we might not get information about their positions.

 However, we can use a word that has the fixed C and E, and then uses three new letters to test the middle positions. But we know the word has R and A, so if we don't include R and A, then we might get feedback that R and A are present? But we already know they are present. We need to find their positions.

 So we must include R and A in the guess? But we can put them in positions that we haven't tried.

 Let me try to form a word for possibility 2: C ? R A E. We can choose a common letter for the second position, like 'L'. So the word would be ""CLRAE"" — but is that a word? No, because it's not a valid English word.

 Similarly, for possibility 3: C A ? R E, we can try ""CATER"" — that is a word.

 But note: we are constrained by valid English words.

 So we need to choose a valid English word that starts with C and ends with E, and includes R and A in positions 2,3, or 4.

 Let me think of words that start with C and end with E:

 - crate: C R A T E -> but we have fixed C and E, and then R at position 2, A at position 3? But we know from the first guess that R cannot be at position 2 (because we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong). So crate would have R at position 2, which we know is wrong. So we shouldn't put R at position 2.

 Similarly, we cannot put A at position 3.

 So we need a word that has:

 - C at 1, E at 5
 - R not at 2, A not at 3.

 And the word must be valid.

 Let me list some words:

 - cable: C A B L E -> has A at position 2 (which is allowed) and no R? But we know the word has R, so we must include R? Actually, we don't have to include R in this guess, but then we won't get information about R's position. We can include R in a later guess.

 However, we have limited guesses (6 total). So we should try to get as much information as possible.

 We can try a word that has R in position 3 or 4 and A in position 2 or 4.

 Example words:

 - carve: C A R V E -> has A at 2 and R at 3. This fits possibility 1: C A R ? E. But we don't know the fourth letter. And carve is a word.

 - carex: not common, but carex is a word? It's a genus of plants. But let's stick to common words.

 - carle: not common.

 - carpe: not a word.

 - carte: C A R T E -> but we know the fifth letter is E, so that's fine. But again, R is at position 3 and A at 2.

 So carve and carte are words that fit the pattern C A R ? E.

 But we also want to test other structures.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A at position 4 and R at position 3: like C ? R A E. What words? 

 - crease: too long, we need 5 letters.

 - crate: but R at 2 is not allowed.

 - crane: we already used.

 - crave: C R A V E -> but R is at position 2, which is not allowed.

 - grace: but it doesn't start with C? It starts with G.

 We need to start with C.

 - corea: not common, and it ends with A, not E.

 - corae: not a word.

 - ceria: not ending with E.

 It's hard to find a word of the form C ? R A E.

 What about C ? R ? E, but we need to include A somewhere? We don't have to include A in this guess? But we know the word has A, so if we don't include A, then the feedback will show that A is still present (but we already know that). We are more interested in the position.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4 and R in position 4? Not possible.

 Another idea: try a word that has R in position 4 and A in position 2: C A ? R E.

 Words: 
 - cater: C A T E R -> but it ends with R, not E. We need to end with E.

 - caper: C A P E R -> ends with R.

 - caner: C A N E R -> but we know N is not in the word, so we cannot use N.

 - carer: has R at 4, but duplicate R and ends with R.

 - cager: C A G E R -> ends with R.

 It's difficult to find a word ending with E that has the pattern C A ? R E.

 How about ""cadre""? C A D R E -> that's a word! And it ends with E.

 So ""cadre"" has:
   - C at 1
   - A at 2
   - D at 3
   - R at 4
   - E at 5

 This fits the pattern of possibility 3: C A X R E (with X being D).

 But we are not sure if the secret word has this structure.

 However, by guessing ""cadre"", we can test:

 - If the secret is possibility 1 (C A R X E), then the feedback for ""cadre"" would be:
      C: ✓
      A: ✓ (because in possibility 1, A is at position 2)
      D: compared to R (secret position 3) -> D is not in the word? So x
      R: compared to X (secret position 4) -> but the secret has R at position 3, so the R in our guess at position 4 would be compared to the secret's position 4 (which is X). If X is not R, then R would be marked as present but wrong position? Because the secret has an R at position 3 that we haven't matched? But we have an R in the guess at position 4. So the feedback for R would be: present but wrong position? And the secret has only one R? We don't know, but we haven't seen duplicate feedback.

 - If the secret is possibility 2 (C X R A E), then the feedback for ""cadre"" would be:
      C: ✓
      A: at position 2 -> compared to the secret's position 2 which is X (not A, because in possibility 2, A is at position 4). So A would be marked as present but wrong position? Because the secret has an A at position 4.
      D: compared to R (secret position 3) -> D is not R, and if D is not in the word, then x
      R: compared to A (secret position 4) -> R is not A, and if R is not in the secret elsewhere? But the secret has R at position 3, so R is present but we have it at position 4? So R would be marked as present but wrong position? 
      E: ✓

 - If the secret is possibility 3 (C A X R E), then the feedback for ""cadre"" would be:
      C: ✓
      A: ✓ (because secret has A at position 2)
      D: compared to X (secret position 3) -> if the secret's third letter is D, then ✓, else if not, then if D is in the word elsewhere? But we don't know. If not, then x.
      R: compared to R (secret position 4) -> ✓
      E: ✓

 So if the secret is possibility 3, we would get: ✓ ✓ (if D matches) ✓ ✓ ✓, or if D doesn't match then ✓ ✓ x ✓ ✓.

 But we don't know the third letter in possibility 3.

 Given that, ""cadre"" is a good candidate because:

 - It is a valid English word.
 - It has the fixed C and E.
 - It has A in position 2 (which is a candidate position for A) and R in position 4 (a candidate position for R).

 And it will help us distinguish:

 - If we get A at position 2 correct and R at position 4 correct, then it must be possibility 3 and the third letter must be D? But wait, we are guessing D at position 3. If the secret is possibility 3 and the third letter is not D, then we get x for D, but we still know the structure is C A ? R E and we can find the missing letter later.

 - If we get A correct at 2 but R not correct at 4 (but present elsewhere), then it might be possibility 1.

 - If we get A not correct at 2 (but present) and R not correct at 4 (but present), then it might be possibility 2.

 So we can learn a lot.

 But note: we are not sure about the third letter, but we can get feedback on D.

 Also, we know the word doesn't have N, so D is a new letter.

 Let's go with ""cadre"".

 So our second guess: ""cadre""

<guess>cadre</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where C(✓), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(✓), we know:
- The secret word starts with C and ends with E: C _ _ _ E
- R is in the word but not in position 2
- A is in the word but not in position 3
- N is absent

The possible structures for the secret word are:
1. C A R _ E (A at position 2, R at position 3)
2. C _ R A E (R at position 3, A at position 4)
3. C A _ R E (A at position 2, R at position 4)

For the second guess, ""cadre"" is chosen because:
- It starts with C and ends with E to maintain fixed positions
- It tests A in position 2 and R in position 4 (aligning with possibility 3)
- It introduces ""D"" in position 3 as a new letter probe
- It is a valid English word

This guess will help distinguish between the structures:
- If A and R are both correct, it supports possibility 3 (C A _ R E)
- If A is correct but R is misplaced, it suggests possibility 1 (C A R _ E)
- If A is misplaced and R is correct, it suggests possibility 2 (C _ R A E)
- Feedback on ""D"" will reveal if it's in the word or not",Guess 2: cadre -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) D(x) R(-) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,carve,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(✓), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(✓)

 Interpretation:
 - C is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
 - R is in the word but not in position 2 (it's in the word elsewhere).
 - A is in the word but not in position 3 (it's in the word elsewhere).
 - N is not in the word at all.
 - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

 So, we know:
 - The first letter is C and the fifth letter is E. So the word is of the form: C _ _ _ E
 - The word contains R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively (and also not in position 1 or 5 because those are taken by C and E).
 - The letter N is absent.

 We also know that the word does not contain N.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should try to find a word that:
 1. Starts with C and ends with E (to confirm the fixed positions, but actually we already know they are fixed, so we can use them to test other positions).
 2. Includes R and A in positions that are not 2 and 3 (and not 1 or 5) and also not in the same positions as the first guess (because we know they were wrong there).

 However, note that in the first guess, R was in position 2 and A in position 3, and they were marked as present but in the wrong position. So they must appear in the word in positions 4, or possibly 2 and 3 are not the only positions? Actually, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

 We know:
 - Position 1: C (fixed)
 - Position 5: E (fixed)
 - The word has R and A, but not in position 2 or 3? Actually, the feedback for R was at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. Similarly, A was at position 3 and marked as present but wrong position.

 So R must be in position 3 or 4? But wait, position 3 was A and it was wrong, so R cannot be in position 2 (because that's where we put it and it was wrong) and similarly A cannot be in position 3. Also, R and A cannot be in position 1 or 5 because those are fixed to C and E.

 Therefore, the only positions left for R and A are 3 and 4? Actually, position 3 is available for R? But note: we had A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't prevent R from being in position 3? Actually, no: because the feedback for R was at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong, meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. Similarly, A is in the word but not at position 3.

 So R must be in position 3 or 4? And A must be in position 2 or 4? But note: we have two letters to place: R and A, and two positions: 2, 3, and 4. However, we cannot put both in the same position. So we have to consider:

 Possibilities for R: position 3 or 4 (because position 2 is excluded by the feedback, and 1 and 5 are fixed and not R).
 Possibilities for A: position 2 or 4 (because position 3 is excluded, and 1 and 5 are fixed and not A).

 But note: if we put R in position 4, then A can be in position 2 or 3? But wait, position 3 is excluded for A. So A can only be in position 2 or 4. Similarly, R can be in position 3 or 4.

 However, we must also consider that the same letter might not appear twice? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, but we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Since the feedback for the first guess didn't show any duplicate, and we only have one R and one A in the guess, we assume the word has at least one R and one A.

 But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. However, without evidence of duplicates, we can assume that R and A are single.

 So the two letters R and A must be placed in two of the three positions: 2, 3, 4? But actually, we have two positions to fill: 2, 3, and 4, but we have two letters. However, we have constraints:

 - R cannot be in 2 -> so R must be in 3 or 4.
 - A cannot be in 3 -> so A must be in 2 or 4.

 And they cannot be in the same position. So the possibilities:

 Option 1: R in 3 and A in 2 -> word: C A R _ E
 Option 2: R in 3 and A in 4 -> word: C _ R A E
 Option 3: R in 4 and A in 2 -> word: C A _ R E
 Option 4: R in 4 and A in 4 -> not possible (same position)

 So we have three possibilities for the structure:

 1. C A R _ E
 2. C _ R A E
 3. C A _ R E

 We also know that the word does not contain N (and we know that from the first guess, N was absent).

 Now, we need to choose a word that will help us distinguish between these possibilities and also reveal the missing letter.

 The missing letter is the one in the blank. We have to consider that the blank could be any letter (except N, and also excluding C, R, A, E because they are already present? But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but we haven't seen duplicates so far. So we avoid duplicates for now.

 However, we must also consider that the word might have more than one of a letter? But without evidence, we assume no duplicates for now.

 So the missing letter is a new letter that we haven't tried yet? We have tried: C, R, A, N, E. So we know N is absent. The missing letter must be a letter that is not C, R, A, E, and not N.

 We have 21 letters left (the alphabet minus C, R, A, E, N).

 But we also want to test the positions of R and A.

 How can we design a guess that will help us distinguish between the three structures?

 We can try to use a word that has:

 - C at the start and E at the end (to keep the fixed letters).
 - We want to test the positions for R and A and also the unknown letter.

 However, note: we are allowed to use any 5-letter word, not necessarily one that fits the fixed C and E? But using the fixed letters might help us get more information about the middle.

 But we already know C and E are fixed, so we should keep them to get more information about the middle.

 So let's form a word that has:

 - First letter: C
 - Fifth letter: E
 - And then we choose the middle three letters to test the possibilities.

 We have three structures to test. We can try to cover as many possibilities as possible.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has A and R in positions that would be consistent with only one of the structures.

 For example, if we try a word that has A in position 2 and R in position 3, that would be consistent with structure 1 (C A R _ E). But if we get feedback that A is in the correct position (if the word is structure 1) then we know. Similarly, if we try a word that has A in position 4 and R in position 3, that would be consistent with structure 2.

 However, we don't know which structure it is, so we can choose a word that has A and R in positions that are not overlapping with the possibilities? Actually, we can choose a word that has A and R in positions that we haven't tried for them.

 But note: we have already tried R in position 2 (which was wrong) and A in position 3 (which was wrong). So we want to try R in a new position (either 3 or 4) and A in a new position (either 2 or 4).

 We can try to put R in position 3 and A in position 4? That would be:

 Word: C _ R A E

 But we don't know the second letter. We can choose a letter for the second position that is common and not N.

 Similarly, we can try to put A in position 2 and R in position 4: C A _ R E.

 But we don't know the third letter.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses one of the structures and a common letter for the blank.

 However, we have three possibilities. We can try to eliminate two at once.

 Let me list the three possibilities:

 Possibility 1: C A R X E  (where X is the unknown letter, not N and not C,R,A,E)
 Possibility 2: C X R A E  (X is the unknown letter, same constraints)
 Possibility 3: C A X R E  (X is the unknown letter)

 We can try a word that is in one of these forms? But we don't know which one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has:

 - C at 1, E at 5
 - A in position 2 and R in position 4? That would be: C A ? R E

 This word would be consistent with possibility 3 (if the ? is the same as the unknown in possibility 3) but not with possibility 1 or 2.

 How?

 - If the secret word is possibility 1 (C A R X E), then our guess C A ? R E would have:
   - C: correct (position 1)
   - A: correct (position 2) -> because in the secret word A is at position 2? Actually, in possibility 1, the secret word is C A R X E, so A is at position 2. So if we guess C A ? R E, then:
        Position 1: C -> ✓
        Position 2: A -> ✓ (if the secret is possibility 1, then A is at 2, so correct)
        Position 3: ? -> we don't know, but in the secret (possibility 1) it's R, so if we put a letter there, it would be compared to R.
        Position 4: R -> in the secret (possibility 1) the fourth letter is X (which is not R, because R is at position 3). So R in our guess at position 4 would be compared to X (which is not R). So R would be marked as absent? But wait, the secret word has R at position 3, so R is present but not at position 4. So the feedback for R would be: present but wrong position? But note: we already have an R in the word (at position 4) and the secret has one R at position 3. So the feedback for R would be: we have one R in the guess and one in the secret, so the R at position 4 would be marked as present but wrong position? But also, we have the A at position 2 which is correct.

 However, we are trying to get information about the structure.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't commit to one structure but tests multiple.

 Another idea: use a word that has the letter R in position 3 and A in position 4? That would be: C ? R A E.

 This would be consistent with possibility 2 (C X R A E) if the ? is the same as X.

 But if the secret is possibility 1 (C A R X E), then our guess C ? R A E would have:
   - C: ✓
   - ? at position 2: if the secret has A at position 2, then if we put a letter that is not A, then the A in our guess is at position 4? But wait, we have A at position 4. In the secret, A is at position 2, so the A in our guess at position 4 would be compared to the secret's fourth letter (which is X, not A). So the A would be marked as absent? But the secret has an A at position 2, so the A in our guess at position 4 should be marked as present but wrong position? Because the secret has an A that we haven't accounted for? 

 Actually, the feedback for the first guess told us that A is in the word but not at position 3. So in the secret, A is at position 2 or 4? But in possibility 1, it's at 2, and in possibility 2, it's at 4. In possibility 3, it's at 2.

 So if we guess C ? R A E:

 - If the secret is possibility 1 (C A R X E):
   - Position 1: C -> ✓
   - Position 2: ? (let's say we use a letter, say B) -> compared to A (secret position 2): if B != A, then B is not in the word? Or if it is, but we don't know. Actually, we are using a new letter for position 2.
   - Position 3: R -> compared to R (secret position 3): ✓
   - Position 4: A -> compared to X (secret position 4): but the secret has A at position 2, so the A in our guess at position 4 is not in the secret? Actually, the secret has only one A (at position 2) and we haven't guessed that A yet? But we have an A in the guess at position 4. The secret has an A at position 2, so the A in the guess is present but should be marked as wrong position? But note: the secret's A at position 2 has not been matched by our guess (because we have a different letter at position 2). So the feedback for A at position 4 would be: present but wrong position? Because the secret has an A that we haven't found in the correct position.

 However, the feedback system: it will mark the A at position 4 as present but wrong position? Because the secret has an A that is not at position 4? And we haven't used an A in the correct position (position 2) in this guess.

 But if we use a word that has A at position 4, and the secret has A at position 2, then the A is present but in the wrong position.

 Similarly, if the secret is possibility 2 (C X R A E), then our guess C ? R A E would have:
   - C: ✓
   - ? at position 2: compared to X (if we choose the same letter as X, then ✓, otherwise if not, then if the letter is in the word it might be marked as present, but we don't know X)
   - R at position 3: ✓ (because secret has R at 3)
   - A at position 4: ✓ (because secret has A at 4)

 So if the secret is possibility 2, then we would get two more correct letters (R at 3 and A at 4) and the second letter might be correct if we guessed it.

 But we don't know the second letter. So we can choose a common letter for the second position.

 Similarly, if the secret is possibility 3 (C A X R E), then our guess C ? R A E would have:
   - C: ✓
   - ? at position 2: compared to A (secret position 2) -> if we put a letter that is not A, then it would be marked as absent (if the letter is not in the word) or present but wrong (if the letter is elsewhere). But the secret has A at position 2, so if we don't guess A at position 2, then the A we have at position 4 would be compared to the secret's position 4 which is R (not A). So the A in our guess would be marked as present but wrong position? Because the secret has an A at position 2 that we haven't matched.

 However, we are not using A at position 2, so the A at position 4 would be the only A in the guess and it would match the A in the secret (but at position 2) so it would be marked as present but wrong position.

 And the R at position 3: in the secret (possibility 3) the R is at position 4, so the R at position 3 in our guess would be compared to the secret's position 3 which is X (not R). So R would be marked as present but wrong position? Because the secret has an R at position 4.

 So in summary, for the guess C ? R A E:

 - If the secret is possibility 1 (C A R X E):
   - We get: C(✓), [letter at 2: if it's A then ✓, but we are not using A at 2? We are using an unknown letter. Let me assume we use a letter that is not A and not in the word, then: 
        Position 1: ✓
        Position 2: x (if the letter is not in the word) or - (if it is elsewhere, but we don't know)
        Position 3: ✓ (because R is at 3 in the secret)
        Position 4: - (because A is in the word but at position 2, so we mark A at 4 as present but wrong)
        Position 5: ✓

   But note: we have two fixed letters (C and E) and we know they are fixed, so we can focus on the middle.

 - If the secret is possibility 2 (C X R A E):
   - We get: 
        Position 1: ✓
        Position 2: if we guessed X, then ✓, else if we guessed a letter not in the word: x, or if in the word but not at 2: -
        Position 3: ✓
        Position 4: ✓
        Position 5: ✓

   So we would get at least three checks (if we didn't guess the second letter correctly) and if we did, then four.

 - If the secret is possibility 3 (C A X R E):
   - We get:
        Position 1: ✓
        Position 2: if we guessed a letter that is not A and not in the word: x (because the secret has A at 2, but we didn't guess it, and if our letter is not in the word, then x)
        Position 3: R -> but the secret has X at 3 (which is not R) and R is at 4, so R is present but not at 3 -> so -
        Position 4: A -> the secret has R at 4, so A is not at 4. But the secret has A at 2, so A is present but not at 4 -> so -
        Position 5: ✓

   So we would get: ✓, x, -, -, ✓

 This seems messy because the feedback for the second letter and the third and fourth depend on what we choose and what the secret is.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't use R and A in the middle, but uses new letters? But we know the word has R and A, so we must include them? Actually, we don't have to include them, but if we don't, we might not get information about their positions.

 However, we can use a word that has the fixed C and E, and then uses three new letters to test the middle positions. But we know the word has R and A, so if we don't include R and A, then we might get feedback that R and A are present? But we already know they are present. We need to find their positions.

 So we must include R and A in the guess? But we can put them in positions that we haven't tried.

 Let me try to form a word for possibility 2: C ? R A E. We can choose a common letter for the second position, like 'L'. So the word would be ""CLRAE"" — but is that a word? No, because it's not a valid English word.

 Similarly, for possibility 3: C A ? R E, we can try ""CATER"" — that is a word.

 But note: we are constrained by valid English words.

 So we need to choose a valid English word that starts with C and ends with E, and includes R and A in positions 2,3, or 4.

 Let me think of words that start with C and end with E:

 - crate: C R A T E -> but we have fixed C and E, and then R at position 2, A at position 3? But we know from the first guess that R cannot be at position 2 (because we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong). So crate would have R at position 2, which we know is wrong. So we shouldn't put R at position 2.

 Similarly, we cannot put A at position 3.

 So we need a word that has:

 - C at 1, E at 5
 - R not at 2, A not at 3.

 And the word must be valid.

 Let me list some words:

 - cable: C A B L E -> has A at position 2 (which is allowed) and no R? But we know the word has R, so we must include R? Actually, we don't have to include R in this guess, but then we won't get information about R's position. We can include R in a later guess.

 However, we have limited guesses (6 total). So we should try to get as much information as possible.

 We can try a word that has R in position 3 or 4 and A in position 2 or 4.

 Example words:

 - carve: C A R V E -> has A at 2 and R at 3. This fits possibility 1: C A R ? E. But we don't know the fourth letter. And carve is a word.

 - carex: not common, but carex is a word? It's a genus of plants. But let's stick to common words.

 - carle: not common.

 - carpe: not a word.

 - carte: C A R T E -> but we know the fifth letter is E, so that's fine. But again, R is at position 3 and A at 2.

 So carve and carte are words that fit the pattern C A R ? E.

 But we also want to test other structures.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A at position 4 and R at position 3: like C ? R A E. What words? 

 - crease: too long, we need 5 letters.

 - crate: but R at 2 is not allowed.

 - crane: we already used.

 - crave: C R A V E -> but R is at position 2, which is not allowed.

 - grace: but it doesn't start with C? It starts with G.

 We need to start with C.

 - corea: not common, and it ends with A, not E.

 - corae: not a word.

 - ceria: not ending with E.

 It's hard to find a word of the form C ? R A E.

 What about C ? R ? E, but we need to include A somewhere? We don't have to include A in this guess? But we know the word has A, so if we don't include A, then the feedback will show that A is still present (but we already know that). We are more interested in the position.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4 and R in position 4? Not possible.

 Another idea: try a word that has R in position 4 and A in position 2: C A ? R E.

 Words: 
 - cater: C A T E R -> but it ends with R, not E. We need to end with E.

 - caper: C A P E R -> ends with R.

 - caner: C A N E R -> but we know N is not in the word, so we cannot use N.

 - carer: has R at 4, but duplicate R and ends with R.

 - cager: C A G E R -> ends with R.

 It's difficult to find a word ending with E that has the pattern C A ? R E.

 How about ""cadre""? C A D R E -> that's a word! And it ends with E.

 So ""cadre"" has:
   - C at 1
   - A at 2
   - D at 3
   - R at 4
   - E at 5

 This fits the pattern of possibility 3: C A X R E (with X being D).

 But we are not sure if the secret word has this structure.

 However, by guessing ""cadre"", we can test:

 - If the secret is possibility 1 (C A R X E), then the feedback for ""cadre"" would be:
      C: ✓
      A: ✓ (because in possibility 1, A is at position 2)
      D: compared to R (secret position 3) -> D is not in the word? So x
      R: compared to X (secret position 4) -> but the secret has R at position 3, so the R in our guess at position 4 would be compared to the secret's position 4 (which is X). If X is not R, then R would be marked as present but wrong position? Because the secret has an R at position 3 that we haven't matched? But we have an R in the guess at position 4. So the feedback for R would be: present but wrong position? And the secret has only one R? We don't know, but we haven't seen duplicate feedback.

 - If the secret is possibility 2 (C X R A E), then the feedback for ""cadre"" would be:
      C: ✓
      A: at position 2 -> compared to the secret's position 2 which is X (not A, because in possibility 2, A is at position 4). So A would be marked as present but wrong position? Because the secret has an A at position 4.
      D: compared to R (secret position 3) -> D is not R, and if D is not in the word, then x
      R: compared to A (secret position 4) -> R is not A, and if R is not in the secret elsewhere? But the secret has R at position 3, so R is present but we have it at position 4? So R would be marked as present but wrong position? 
      E: ✓

 - If the secret is possibility 3 (C A X R E), then the feedback for ""cadre"" would be:
      C: ✓
      A: ✓ (because secret has A at position 2)
      D: compared to X (secret position 3) -> if the secret's third letter is D, then ✓, else if not, then if D is in the word elsewhere? But we don't know. If not, then x.
      R: compared to R (secret position 4) -> ✓
      E: ✓

 So if the secret is possibility 3, we would get: ✓ ✓ (if D matches) ✓ ✓ ✓, or if D doesn't match then ✓ ✓ x ✓ ✓.

 But we don't know the third letter in possibility 3.

 Given that, ""cadre"" is a good candidate because:

 - It is a valid English word.
 - It has the fixed C and E.
 - It has A in position 2 (which is a candidate position for A) and R in position 4 (a candidate position for R).

 And it will help us distinguish:

 - If we get A at position 2 correct and R at position 4 correct, then it must be possibility 3 and the third letter must be D? But wait, we are guessing D at position 3. If the secret is possibility 3 and the third letter is not D, then we get x for D, but we still know the structure is C A ? R E and we can find the missing letter later.

 - If we get A correct at 2 but R not correct at 4 (but present elsewhere), then it might be possibility 1.

 - If we get A not correct at 2 (but present) and R not correct at 4 (but present), then it might be possibility 2.

 So we can learn a lot.

 But note: we are not sure about the third letter, but we can get feedback on D.

 Also, we know the word doesn't have N, so D is a new letter.

 Let's go with ""cadre"".

 So our second guess: ""cadre""

<guess>cadre</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where C(✓), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(✓), we know:
- The secret word starts with C and ends with E: C _ _ _ E
- R is in the word but not in position 2
- A is in the word but not in position 3
- N is absent

The possible structures for the secret word are:
1. C A R _ E (A at position 2, R at position 3)
2. C _ R A E (R at position 3, A at position 4)
3. C A _ R E (A at position 2, R at position 4)

For the second guess, ""cadre"" is chosen because:
- It starts with C and ends with E to maintain fixed positions
- It tests A in position 2 and R in position 4 (aligning with possibility 3)
- It introduces ""D"" in position 3 as a new letter probe
- It is a valid English word

This guess will help distinguish between the structures:
- If A and R are both correct, it supports possibility 3 (C A _ R E)
- If A is correct but R is misplaced, it suggests possibility 1 (C A R _ E)
- If A is misplaced and R is correct, it suggests possibility 2 (C _ R A E)
- Feedback on ""D"" will reveal if it's in the word or not

So the word is of the form: C _ _ _ E\n - The word contains R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively (and also not in position 1 or 5 because those are taken by C and E).\n - The letter N is absent.\n\n We also know that the word does not contain N.\n\n Now, we need to make a second guess. We should try to find a word that:\n 1. Starts with C and ends with E (to confirm the fixed positions, but actually we already know they are fixed, so we can use them to test other positions).\n 2. Includes R and A in positions that are not 2 and 3 (and not 1 or 5) and also not in the same positions as the first guess (because we know they were wrong there).\n\n However, note that in the first guess, R was in position 2 and A in position 3, and they were marked as present but in the wrong position. So they must appear in the word in positions 4, or possibly 2 and 3 are not the only positions? Actually, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\n We know:\n - Position 1: C (fixed)\n - Position 5: E (fixed)\n - The word has R and A, but not in position 2 or 3? Actually, the feedback for R was at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. Similarly, A was at position 3 and marked as present but wrong position.\n\n So R must be in position 3 or 4? But wait, position 3 was A and it was wrong, so R cannot be in position 2 (because that\'s where we put it and it was wrong) and similarly A cannot be in position 3. Also, R and A cannot be in position 1 or 5 because those are fixed to C and E.\n\n Therefore, the only positions left for R and A are 3 and 4? Actually, position 3 is available for R? But note: we had A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn\'t prevent R from being in position 3? Actually, no: because the feedback for R was at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong, meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. Similarly, A is in the word but not at position 3.\n\n So R must be in position 3 or 4? And A must be in position 2 or 4? But note: we have two letters to place: R and A, and two positions: 2, 3, and 4. However, we cannot put both in the same position. So we have to consider:\n\n Possibilities for R: position 3 or 4 (because position 2 is excluded by the feedback, and 1 and 5 are fixed and not R).\n Possibilities for A: position 2 or 4 (because position 3 is excluded, and 1 and 5 are fixed and not A).\n\n But note: if we put R in position 4, then A can be in position 2 or 3? But wait, position 3 is excluded for A. So A can only be in position 2 or 4. Similarly, R can be in position 3 or 4.\n\n However, we must also consider that the same letter might not appear twice? The feedback doesn\'t indicate duplicates, but we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. Since the feedback for the first guess didn\'t show any duplicate, and we only have one R and one A in the guess, we assume the word has at least one R and one A.\n\n But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know. However, without evidence of duplicates, we can assume that R and A are single.\n\n So the two letters R and A must be placed in two of the three positions: 2, 3, 4? But actually, we have two positions to fill: 2, 3, and 4, but we have two letters. However, we have constraints:\n\n - R cannot be in 2 -> so R must be in 3 or 4.\n - A cannot be in 3 -> so A must be in 2 or 4.\n\n And they cannot be in the same position. So the possibilities:\n\n Option 1: R in 3 and A in 2 -> word: C A R _ E\n Option 2: R in 3 and A in 4 -> word: C _ R A E\n Option 3: R in 4 and A in 2 -> word: C A _ R E\n Option 4: R in 4 and A in 4 -> not possible (same position)\n\n So we have three possibilities for the structure:\n\n 1. C A R _ E\n 2. C _ R A E\n 3. C A _ R E\n\n We also know that the word does not contain N (and we know that from the first guess, N was absent).\n\n Now, we need to choose a word that will help us distinguish between these possibilities and also reveal the missing letter.\n\n The missing letter is the one in the blank. We have to consider that the blank could be any letter (except N, and also excluding C, R, A, E because they are already present? But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know, but we haven\'t seen duplicates so far. So we avoid duplicates for now.\n\n However, we must also consider that the word might have more than one of a letter? But without evidence, we assume no duplicates for now.\n\n So the missing letter is a new letter that we haven\'t tried yet? We have tried: C, R, A, N, E. So we know N is absent. The missing letter must be a letter that is not C, R, A, E, and not N.\n\n We have 21 letters left (the alphabet minus C, R, A, E, N).\n\n But we also want to test the positions of R and A.\n\n How can we design a guess that will help us distinguish between the three structures?\n\n We can try to use a word that has:\n\n - C at the start and E at the end (to keep the fixed letters).\n - We want to test the positions for R and A and also the unknown letter.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to use any 5-letter word, not necessarily one that fits the fixed C and E? But using the fixed letters might help us get more information about the middle.\n\n But we already know C and E are fixed, so we should keep them to get more information about the middle.\n\n So let\'s form a word that has:\n\n - First letter: C\n - Fifth letter: E\n - And then we choose the middle three letters to test the possibilities.\n\n We have three structures to test. We can try to cover as many possibilities as possible.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has A and R in positions that would be consistent with only one of the structures.\n\n For example, if we try a word that has A in position 2 and R in position 3, that would be consistent with structure 1 (C A R _ E). But if we get feedback that A is in the correct position (if the word is structure 1) then we know. Similarly, if we try a word that has A in position 4 and R in position 3, that would be consistent with structure 2.\n\n However, we don\'t know which structure it is, so we can choose a word that has A and R in positions that are not overlapping with the possibilities? Actually, we can choose a word that has A and R in positions that we haven\'t tried for them.\n\n But note: we have already tried R in position 2 (which was wrong) and A in position 3 (which was wrong). So we want to try R in a new position (either 3 or 4) and A in a new position (either 2 or 4).\n\n We can try to put R in position 3 and A in position 4? That would be:\n\n Word: C _ R A E\n\n But we don\'t know the second letter. We can choose a letter for the second position that is common and not N.\n\n Similarly, we can try to put A in position 2 and R in position 4: C A _ R E.\n\n But we don\'t know the third letter.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses one of the structures and a common letter for the blank.\n\n However, we have three possibilities. We can try to eliminate two at once.\n\n Let me list the three possibilities:\n\n Possibility 1: C A R X E  (where X is the unknown letter, not N and not C,R,A,E)\n Possibility 2: C X R A E  (X is the unknown letter, same constraints)\n Possibility 3: C A X R E  (X is the unknown letter)\n\n We can try a word that is in one of these forms? But we don\'t know which one.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has:\n\n - C at 1, E at 5\n - A in position 2 and R in position 4? That would be: C A ? R E\n\n This word would be consistent with possibility 3 (if the ? is the same as the unknown in possibility 3) but not with possibility 1 or 2.\n\n How?\n\n - If the secret word is possibility 1 (C A R X E), then our guess C A ? R E would have:\n   - C: correct (position 1)\n   - A: correct (position 2) -> because in the secret word A is at position 2? Actually, in possibility 1, the secret word is C A R X E, so A is at position 2. So if we guess C A ? R E, then:\n        Position 1: C -> ✓\n        Position 2: A -> ✓ (if the secret is possibility 1, then A is at 2, so correct)\n        Position 3: ? -> we don\'t know, but in the secret (possibility 1) it\'s R, so if we put a letter there, it would be compared to R.\n        Position 4: R -> in the secret (possibility 1) the fourth letter is X (which is not R, because R is at position 3). So R in our guess at position 4 would be compared to X (which is not R). So R would be marked as absent? But wait, the secret word has R at position 3, so R is present but not at position 4. So the feedback for R would be: present but wrong position? But note: we already have an R in the word (at position 4) and the secret has one R at position 3. So the feedback for R would be: we have one R in the guess and one in the secret, so the R at position 4 would be marked as present but wrong position? But also, we have the A at position 2 which is correct.\n\n However, we are trying to get information about the structure.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t commit to one structure but tests multiple.\n\n Another idea: use a word that has the letter R in position 3 and A in position 4? That would be: C ? R A E.\n\n This would be consistent with possibility 2 (C X R A E) if the ? is the same as X.\n\n But if the secret is possibility 1 (C A R X E), then our guess C ? R A E would have:\n   - C: ✓\n   - ? at position 2: if the secret has A at position 2, then if we put a letter that is not A, then the A in our guess is at position 4? But wait, we have A at position 4. In the secret, A is at position 2, so the A in our guess at position 4 would be compared to the secret\'s fourth letter (which is X, not A). So the A would be marked as absent? But the secret has an A at position 2, so the A in our guess at position 4 should be marked as present but wrong position? Because the secret has an A that we haven\'t accounted for? \n\n Actually, the feedback for the first guess told us that A is in the word but not at position 3. So in the secret, A is at position 2 or 4? But in possibility 1, it\'s at 2, and in possibility 2, it\'s at 4. In possibility 3, it\'s at 2.\n\n So if we guess C ? R A E:\n\n - If the secret is possibility 1 (C A R X E):\n   - Position 1: C -> ✓\n   - Position 2: ? (let\'s say we use a letter, say B) -> compared to A (secret position 2): if B != A, then B is not in the word? Or if it is, but we don\'t know. Actually, we are using a new letter for position 2.\n   - Position 3: R -> compared to R (secret position 3): ✓\n   - Position 4: A -> compared to X (secret position 4): but the secret has A at position 2, so the A in our guess at position 4 is not in the secret? Actually, the secret has only one A (at position 2) and we haven\'t guessed that A yet? But we have an A in the guess at position 4. The secret has an A at position 2, so the A in the guess is present but should be marked as wrong position? But note: the secret\'s A at position 2 has not been matched by our guess (because we have a different letter at position 2). So the feedback for A at position 4 would be: present but wrong position? Because the secret has an A that we haven\'t found in the correct position.\n\n However, the feedback system: it will mark the A at position 4 as present but wrong position? Because the secret has an A that is not at position 4? And we haven\'t used an A in the correct position (position 2) in this guess.\n\n But if we use a word that has A at position 4, and the secret has A at position 2, then the A is present but in the wrong position.\n\n Similarly, if the secret is possibility 2 (C X R A E), then our guess C ? R A E would have:\n   - C: ✓\n   - ? at position 2: compared to X (if we choose the same letter as X, then ✓, otherwise if not, then if the letter is in the word it might be marked as present, but we don\'t know X)\n   - R at position 3: ✓ (because secret has R at 3)\n   - A at position 4: ✓ (because secret has A at 4)\n\n So if the secret is possibility 2, then we would get two more correct letters (R at 3 and A at 4) and the second letter might be correct if we guessed it.\n\n But we don\'t know the second letter. So we can choose a common letter for the second position.\n\n Similarly, if the secret is possibility 3 (C A X R E), then our guess C ? R A E would have:\n   - C: ✓\n   - ? at position 2: compared to A (secret position 2) -> if we put a letter that is not A, then it would be marked as absent (if the letter is not in the word) or present but wrong (if the letter is elsewhere). But the secret has A at position 2, so if we don\'t guess A at position 2, then the A we have at position 4 would be compared to the secret\'s position 4 which is R (not A). So the A in our guess would be marked as present but wrong position? Because the secret has an A at position 2 that we haven\'t matched.\n\n However, we are not using A at position 2, so the A at position 4 would be the only A in the guess and it would match the A in the secret (but at position 2) so it would be marked as present but wrong position.\n\n And the R at position 3: in the secret (possibility 3) the R is at position 4, so the R at position 3 in our guess would be compared to the secret\'s position 3 which is X (not R). So R would be marked as present but wrong position? Because the secret has an R at position 4.\n\n So in summary, for the guess C ? R A E:\n\n - If the secret is possibility 1 (C A R X E):\n   - We get: C(✓), [letter at 2: if it\'s A then ✓, but we are not using A at 2? We are using an unknown letter. Let me assume we use a letter that is not A and not in the word, then: \n        Position 1: ✓\n        Position 2: x (if the letter is not in the word) or - (if it is elsewhere, but we don\'t know)\n        Position 3: ✓ (because R is at 3 in the secret)\n        Position 4: - (because A is in the word but at position 2, so we mark A at 4 as present but wrong)\n        Position 5: ✓\n\n   But note: we have two fixed letters (C and E) and we know they are fixed, so we can focus on the middle.\n\n - If the secret is possibility 2 (C X R A E):\n   - We get: \n        Position 1: ✓\n        Position 2: if we guessed X, then ✓, else if we guessed a letter not in the word: x, or if in the word but not at 2: -\n        Position 3: ✓\n        Position 4: ✓\n        Position 5: ✓\n\n   So we would get at least three checks (if we didn\'t guess the second letter correctly) and if we did, then four.\n\n - If the secret is possibility 3 (C A X R E):\n   - We get:\n        Position 1: ✓\n        Position 2: if we guessed a letter that is not A and not in the word: x (because the secret has A at 2, but we didn\'t guess it, and if our letter is not in the word, then x)\n        Position 3: R -> but the secret has X at 3 (which is not R) and R is at 4, so R is present but not at 3 -> so -\n        Position 4: A -> the secret has R at 4, so A is not at 4. But the secret has A at 2, so A is present but not at 4 -> so -\n        Position 5: ✓\n\n   So we would get: ✓, x, -, -, ✓\n\n This seems messy because the feedback for the second letter and the third and fourth depend on what we choose and what the secret is.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t use R and A in the middle, but uses new letters? But we know the word has R and A, so we must include them? Actually, we don\'t have to include them, but if we don\'t, we might not get information about their positions.\n\n However, we can use a word that has the fixed C and E, and then uses three new letters to test the middle positions. But we know the word has R and A, so if we don\'t include R and A, then we might get feedback that R and A are present? But we already know they are present. We need to find their positions.\n\n So we must include R and A in the guess? But we can put them in positions that we haven\'t tried.\n\n Let me try to form a word for possibility 2: C ? R A E. We can choose a common letter for the second position, like \'L\'. So the word would be ""CLRAE"" — but is that a word? No, because it\'s not a valid English word.\n\n Similarly, for possibility 3: C A ? R E, we can try ""CATER"" — that is a word.\n\n But note: we are constrained by valid English words.\n\n So we need to choose a valid English word that starts with C and ends with E, and includes R and A in positions 2,3, or 4.\n\n Let me think of words that start with C and end with E:\n\n - crate: C R A T E -> but we have fixed C and E, and then R at position 2, A at position 3? But we know from the first guess that R cannot be at position 2 (because we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong). So crate would have R at position 2, which we know is wrong. So we shouldn\'t put R at position 2.\n\n Similarly, we cannot put A at position 3.\n\n So we need a word that has:\n\n - C at 1, E at 5\n - R not at 2, A not at 3.\n\n And the word must be valid.\n\n Let me list some words:\n\n - cable: C A B L E -> has A at position 2 (which is allowed) and no R? But we know the word has R, so we must include R? Actually, we don\'t have to include R in this guess, but then we won\'t get information about R\'s position. We can include R in a later guess.\n\n However, we have limited guesses (6 total). So we should try to get as much information as possible.\n\n We can try a word that has R in position 3 or 4 and A in position 2 or 4.\n\n Example words:\n\n - carve: C A R V E -> has A at 2 and R at 3. This fits possibility 1: C A R ? E. But we don\'t know the fourth letter. And carve is a word.\n\n - carex: not common, but carex is a word? It\'s a genus of plants. But let\'s stick to common words.\n\n - carle: not common.\n\n - carpe: not a word.\n\n - carte: C A R T E -> but we know the fifth letter is E, so that\'s fine. But again, R is at position 3 and A at 2.\n\n So carve and carte are words that fit the pattern C A R ? E.\n\n But we also want to test other structures.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A at position 4 and R at position 3: like C ? R A E. What words? \n\n - crease: too long, we need 5 letters.\n\n - crate: but R at 2 is not allowed.\n\n - crane: we already used.\n\n - crave: C R A V E -> but R is at position 2, which is not allowed.\n\n - grace: but it doesn\'t start with C? It starts with G.\n\n We need to start with C.\n\n - corea: not common, and it ends with A, not E.\n\n - corae: not a word.\n\n - ceria: not ending with E.\n\n It\'s hard to find a word of the form C ? R A E.\n\n What about C ? R ? E, but we need to include A somewhere? We don\'t have to include A in this guess? But we know the word has A, so if we don\'t include A, then the feedback will show that A is still present (but we already know that). We are more interested in the position.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4 and R in position 4? Not possible.\n\n Another idea: try a word that has R in position 4 and A in position 2: C A ? R E.\n\n Words: \n - cater: C A T E R -> but it ends with R, not E. We need to end with E.\n\n - caper: C A P E R -> ends with R.\n\n - caner: C A N E R -> but we know N is not in the word, so we cannot use N.\n\n - carer: has R at 4, but duplicate R and ends with R.\n\n - cager: C A G E R -> ends with R.\n\n It\'s difficult to find a word ending with E that has the pattern C A ? R E.\n\n How about ""cadre""? C A D R E -> that\'s a word! And it ends with E.\n\n So ""cadre"" has:\n   - C at 1\n   - A at 2\n   - D at 3\n   - R at 4\n   - E at 5\n\n This fits the pattern of possibility 3: C A X R E (with X being D).\n\n But we are not sure if the secret word has this structure.\n\n However, by guessing ""cadre"", we can test:\n\n - If the secret is possibility 1 (C A R X E), then the feedback for ""cadre"" would be:\n      C: ✓\n      A: ✓ (because in possibility 1, A is at position 2)\n      D: compared to R (secret position 3) -> D is not in the word? So x\n      R: compared to X (secret position 4) -> but the secret has R at position 3, so the R in our guess at position 4 would be compared to the secret\'s position 4 (which is X). If X is not R, then R would be marked as present but wrong position? Because the secret has an R at position 3 that we haven\'t matched? But we have an R in the guess at position 4. So the feedback for R would be: present but wrong position? And the secret has only one R? We don\'t know, but we haven\'t seen duplicate feedback.\n\n - If the secret is possibility 2 (C X R A E), then the feedback for ""cadre"" would be:\n      C: ✓\n      A: at position 2 -> compared to the secret\'s position 2 which is X (not A, because in possibility 2, A is at position 4). So A would be marked as present but wrong position? Because the secret has an A at position 4.\n      D: compared to R (secret position 3) -> D is not R, and if D is not in the word, then x\n      R: compared to A (secret position 4) -> R is not A, and if R is not in the secret elsewhere? But the secret has R at position 3, so R is present but we have it at position 4? So R would be marked as present but wrong position? \n      E: ✓\n\n - If the secret is possibility 3 (C A X R E), then the feedback for ""cadre"" would be:\n      C: ✓\n      A: ✓ (because secret has A at position 2)\n      D: compared to X (secret position 3) -> if the secret\'s third letter is D, then ✓, else if not, then if D is in the word elsewhere? But we don\'t know.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" 
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: - (present, but wrong position)
- A: - (present, but wrong position)
- N: x (not present)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

Guess 2: ""cadre""
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- A: ✓ (correct position) 
- D: x (not present)
- R: - (present, but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

From Guess 1:
- Secret word starts with 'C' and ends with 'E': so it must be C _ _ _ E
- 'R' is in the word but not at position 2 (where it was in ""crane"")
- 'A' is in the word but not at position 3 (where it was in ""crane"")
- 'N' is not in the word

From Guess 2:
- 'A' is at position 2: since we got a ✓ for A in position 2, we know that the second letter is 'A'. So the word is C A _ _ E
- 'D' is not present (x)
- 'R' is present but not at position 4 (where it was in ""cadre""). Since we have the fixed positions, the word is C A _ _ E and we know the third and fourth letters are to be determined.

Additionally, we have:
- From Guess 1, 'R' is not at position 2 (already known since position 2 is now 'A') and not at position 3 in ""crane"" (but we know position 3 is not its spot). Now in Guess 2, 'R' was tried at position 4 and we got a ""-"", meaning it is present but not at position 4. Therefore, the only remaining position for 'R' is position 3? Because the secret word is C A _ _ E. The positions are 1:C, 2:A, 3:?, 4:?, 5:E.

Since 'R' must be in the word and cannot be in positions 2 (now occupied by A), 4 (tried and not correct), and positions 1 and 5 are fixed, the only spot left is position 3. Therefore, the third letter must be 'R'.

So now we have: C A R _ E

Now, we need the fourth letter. We know from feedback:
- In Guess 2, 'D' was tried at position 3 and was not present, which doesn't contradict because position 3 is now 'R' (so D is indeed absent).
- The fourth letter must not be 'D' because we got x for D (meaning D is not in the secret word at all).

We also know from Guess 1 that 'A' was misplaced. But wait, 'A' is now at position 2 and we got a ✓ in Guess 2, so the feedback in Guess 1 for 'A' being misplaced at position 3 makes sense because we now know 'A' is at position 2.

Additionally, we know 'R' is at position 3 (as deduced) so the word is C A R _ E.

We need to find a valid English word that fits C A R _ E and the missing letter is not N (from Guess1) and not D (from Guess2).

What letters are possible? We have to consider common letters.

Possible words: 
- carve: means to cut or sculpture
- carte: a menu or bill of fare
- carle: a variant of carl, meaning a man of common people (but not common)
- carpe: imperative form of Latin ""carpere"" meaning to seize, but not English
- carse: a Scottish word for low-lying land near a river (but not common)

Other possibilities: care (too short), car (too short), etc.

But verify:
- carve: C A R V E -> valid
- carte: C A R T E -> valid
- carpe: not English word
- carse: valid English word? From my knowledge, it is in some dictionaries.

But let's check if they meet the criteria: the letter must not be N or D. Both V and T are acceptable.

However, we don't have direct feedback on V or T.

We also have another constraint: in Guess 1, when we guessed ""crane"", the letter 'R' was at position 2 and we were told it was present but wrong position. Now that we have the secret as C A R _ E, when we guessed ""crane"", the 'R' was in position 2, but in the secret it should be at position 3. That is consistent because in Guess1, we had:
  Position 1: C (✓) -> matches
  Position 2: R (-) -> this R was compared to secret's position 2 (which we now know is 'A'), so it's not R, but the secret has R at position 3 -> so R should be marked as present but wrong position, which matches the -.

Similarly, the 'A' in Guess1 was at position 3 and we got -, meaning it's not at position 3. In the secret, position 3 is 'R' (so not A), and A is at position 2 -> also matches.

Now, we need to guess a word to find the fourth letter. But note, we have 4 remaining? We can guess a word that has C A R _ E with a specific letter to test. However, we might not know which of the possible words it is.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that we suspect to be the answer. Since we have deduced that the word must be of the form C A R ? E and we don't know?, we can guess one of the options.

But we also have the feedback from Guess2: we got a - for R at position 4. Since we now know R is at position 3, and in Guess2 we put R at position 4, which was wrong (so it should be marked as - because R is in the word but at different position). That is consistent with our deduction.

Moreover, the possible letters for the fourth position: any letter except N and D, and the word must be valid.

Let me list common possibilities:

- carve (C A R V E)
- carte (C A R T E)
- carse (C A R S E)

Are there more? cable doesn't have R at position 3. 

To distinguish or to guess one? We can guess one. We have 6 tries so we can try ""carve"" for example.

But note: we don't need to guess a word that has the fixed positions? Actually, we can guess any 5-letter word to get information. But if we guess the full word, we might solve it.

Since we are almost there, let's try ""carve"".

However, we must consider that we don't know for sure the third letter is R? Actually, we deduced it must be R because:
- R cannot be at position 2 (from Guess1) and cannot be at position 4 (from Guess2), and cannot be at 1 or 5. The only remaining slot is position 3.

Moreover, the word must have R, and we've placed A at 2. Therefore, the deduction seems solid.

So we try a word that fits C A R ? E and hope it's valid.

But to be safe, we can guess ""carve"" and see.

If it's not, then we'll get feedback.

But we have only 4 guesses left? Total guesses: first guess, second guess, now third.

So we can make direct guesses.

But perhaps we should choose a word that covers common letters? However, there are not many possibilities.

We could also consider that the fourth letter has not been tested.

But let's guess ""carve"".

Alternatively, to be more efficient, we can consider other possibilities? But our deduction seems very strong.

What if the secret word had duplicate R? But we haven't seen any evidence. The feedback for ""crane"": R was at position 2 and we were marked as present, so usually there's only one R? Similarly in ""cadre"", we had R at position 4 and got present (as -), but that was one R. Since we then deduced R is at position 3, if there were duplicate R, then in ""cadre"" the R at position 4 might have been marked differently if the fourth letter was also R? But we don't have duplicate R in our guesses so far.

Moreover, if the fourth letter was R, then in Guess2 we would have:
  Position 4: we guessed R, which would be correct? Because the secret has R at position 4? But we got R(-) meaning not correct. So if the secret had R at position 4, we would have gotten ✓ for R at position 4. But we got - which means it is present but not in that position? Contradiction? So the secret cannot have R at position 4? But our deduction is that R is only at position 3 and the fourth letter is not R.

Therefore, we are sure the secret is C A R ? E.

Now, the missing letter must be one that forms a valid English word, and not N or D.

Common options:

- carve (with V)
- carte (with T)
- carse (with S, meaning low land)

Carse: it is acceptable.

But we need to guess one.

We can also consider ""care"" - but 4 letters.

Other rare: carme, caroe, etc.

But we'll go with common ones.

Perhaps we can guess ""carve"" as it is more common.

But note: we have received feedback that in Guess2, D is absent. So we are avoiding D.

Therefore, I will guess ""carve"".

So the third guess: ""carve""

<guess>carve</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- From Guess 1 (""crane""):  
  - C(✓), E(✓) → Secret starts with 'C' and ends with 'E' (C _ _ _ E).  
  - R(-), A(-) → 'R' and 'A' are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.  
  - N(x) → 'N' is absent.  

- From Guess 2 (""cadre""):  
  - C(✓), A(✓), E(✓) → Positions 1, 2, and 5 are fixed: **C A _ _ E**.  
  - D(x) → 'D' is absent.  
  - R(-) → 'R' is present but not in position 4.  

### Deductions:
1. **Position of 'R'**:  
   - 'R' cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 1), position 4 (from Guess 2), or positions 1/5 (fixed).  
   - The only remaining position is 3 → **third letter must be 'R'.**  
   - Secret pattern: **C A R _ E**.  

2. **Fourth letter constraints**:  
   - Cannot be 'N' (Guess 1) or 'D' (Guess 2).  
   - Must form a valid English word.  

3. **Possible candidates for C A R _ E**:  
   - Common words: `carve` (C A R V E), `carte` (C A R T E), `carse` (C A R S E).  
   - Given the constraints, prioritize `carve` for the third guess as it uses 'V', a common untested letter, and is a frequent solution.  

### Why ""carve""?
- Tests 'V' in position 4, a new letter.  
- If correct, solves the puzzle; if not, feedback on 'V' narrows remaining options (e.g., `carte` or `carse`).  
- Efficient given the deduced structure.
