We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
C(x) -> C is not in the word
R(x) -> R is not in the word
A(x) -> A is not in the word
N(x) -> N is not in the word
E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So, the secret word contains the letter E, but not C, R, A, N. Also, since E is not in the last position (as per ""crane"" having E at the end), E might be in a different position.

We know the word has E somewhere, but not at the end (position 5). It could be at positions 1,2,3, or 4.

We need to make a new guess that does not include C, R, A, N, and must include E. Also, since E was in position 5 in ""crane"" and it's marked as wrong position, E is not in position 5. So E must be in one of the first four positions.

We should try to use common letters that haven't been tried yet. We have eliminated 4 consonants: C, R, A, N. And we know E is present.

Common vowels: We have E already, other common vowels are O, I, U. But we know A is out, so O, I, U might be candidates.

Common consonants: Some common consonants left: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

We should try a word that has E in one of the positions 1-4, and uses other common letters not yet excluded.

Possible positions for E: Let's try to place E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, without more information, we might spread our next guess to cover more ground.

A good strategy is to pick a word that includes E and other common letters, and avoids the known absent letters (C, R, A, N).

Let me think of words that have E and don't have C, R, A, N.

Example words:
- ""SPITE"": has S, P, I, T, E -> but E at the end, same position? We need to try E in a different position.
- ""TIMES"": E at the end again? Same as before.
We want a word where E is not at the end.

How about ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E -> E at the end again? Not good.

Let's try to have E at a different position.

Words with E in position 1: ""E"", then common letters? e.g., ""EAGLE"" but A is excluded? A is not in the word, so avoid A.

""EAGLE"" has A -> not allowed? We know A is absent, so we cannot use A.

Other words: ""EDGES"" -> E, D, G, E, S -> but repeats E? And we don't know if the word allows duplicates? The rules don't specify, but usually words can have repeated letters? However, let's avoid duplicates for now to cover more letters.

Options for E at position 1:
- ""E"" + ... without C,R,A,N: e.g., ""ELBOW"", ""EJECT"" (has C? C is excluded) -> ""EJECT"" has C and E? We know C is not in the word, so no.

Better: ""ELITE"" -> E, L, I, T, E -> but has two E's, and we don't know if the word has duplicate E's? Not ideal.

""EXIST"" -> E, X, I, S, T -> E at position 1? But X is less common? Still, possible.

But let's choose a word with more common letters.

Position 2: e.g., ""H"" + E + ... -> ""HELLO"" (has L and O? but also A? wait no, ""HELLO"" has H, E, L, L, O -> duplicates? Also, not 5 distinct letters? Wait, same as above.

Better word: ""PETAL"" -> P, E, T, A, L -> but A is absent, so we can't use A.

Avoid A.

Word: ""QUERY"" -> Q is too rare? Not ideal.

Word: ""STYLE"" -> S, T, Y, L, E -> E at the end? No, we need E not at the end. In STYLE, E is at the end? Position 5: STYLE: S position1, T2, Y3, L4, E5 -> same as crane? We want E in a different position.

To avoid E at the end, how about a word that doesn't end with E? For example, E in position 2 or 3 or 4.

Examples:

- Position 2: ""LEMON"" -> L, E, M, O, N -> wait, N is excluded? We know N is absent. So not.

- Position 2: ""BEGIN"" -> B, E, G, I, N -> N excluded? Not.

- Position 3: ""MODEM"" -> M, O, D, E, M -> duplicates? And N? No N? But duplicates.

- ""TOWEL"" -> T, O, W, E, L -> E is at position 4. So that's good.

TOWEL: T, O, W, E, L -> avoids C,R,A,N. Includes E at position 4 (so not position 5).

Alternatively, ""PILED"" -> P, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4? Positions: P1, I2, L3, E4, D5 -> so E is at position 4? Yes.

Still at a different position.

Another idea: use E in position 1: we haven't tried that. How about ""E"" at the beginning.

Words: ""EQUAL"", but U is vowel? And Q might be rare? Also has U and Q.

""ENSUE"" -> E, N, S, U, E -> but N is excluded? N is not allowed.

""ESTER"" -> E, S, T, E, R -> has R? R is excluded? We know R is absent. So not.

We must avoid C,R,A,N. So no R.

How about ""EIGHT"" -> E, I, G, H, T -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes: E,I,G,H,T. Position: E at1, so not at5.

Similarly, ""ELBOW"" -> E, L, B, O, W -> avoids C,R,A,N.

""ELBOW"": E at position1. Good.

Alternatively, ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E -> E at the end? Position5: same as crane? Not good? But we need to try E at a different position? Actually, crane had E at5, and it was not correct. But with E not at5, but it might be the same for SPIKE? We haven't tried E at5 again? But the feedback said E is in the word but wrong position, meaning E is in the word but not at position5? Therefore, E must be in positions 1,2,3, or4.

Therefore, if we use a word that has E at position5 again, we expect it to be wrong? Yes, so we shouldn't put E at position5 because we know it is not there.

We need to choose a word where E is at positions 1,2,3, or4.

Among the choices:

""ELBOW"": E at position1 -> good? But ""ELBOW"" has E at1? Yes.

""TOWEL"": T,O,W,E,L -> E at position4? Yes.

""QUOTE"": Q, U, O, T, E -> E at5? No, avoid? Because we know E is not at5.

""QUOTE"" ends with E? Position5? Then same? Avoid.

""WHILE"": W, H, I, L, E -> E at5? Avoid.

""BRIDE"": B, R, I, D, E -> has R? R is excluded. Also E at5? Bad.

Let me list words without C,R,A,N and with E not in position5:

Options:

- Position1: ELBOW (E,L,B,O,W) -> letters E,L,B,O,W

- Position1: EIGHT (E,I,G,H,T) -> E,I,G,H,T

- Position1: EMBOW (not common? better use common words)

Other E-position1: EAGER? But A excluded? EAGER has A? Yes, avoid.

EPOXY? E,P,O,X,Y? X and Y uncommon.

Let's try E-position2: words with ?E???

Possible words: ""GUESS"" -> G,U,E,S,S -> duplicates? And S repeated.

""STEEP"" -> S,T,E,E,P -> duplicates, E repeated.

""GROUP"" -> G,R,O,U P? GROUP has R? Excluded.

Avoid R.

Word: ""SLEPT"": S,L,E,P,T -> positions: S1, have E at position 3.

Also: ""FIELD"" -> F,I,E,L,D -> E at position 3? F1,I2,E3,L4,D5.

Avoids C,R,A,N? Yes: F,I,E,L,D? A absent but F,I,L,D not excluded? We don't know about F,I,L,D yet.

Similarly, ""PRIDE"" has R? Excluded.

""FIELD"" is F,I,E,L,D -> E at position3? Yes.

Alternatively, position4: ""LOUPE"" -> L,O,U,P,E -> but E at position5? Same? Avoid? ""LOUPE"" -> spelled L-O-U-P-E, so E at5? Bad.

If the word ends with E? Position5? Then we avoid.

How about ""APPLE"" -> A and P,P? A excluded? Not.

""STALE"" has A? Excluded.

Better: ""SPIEL"" -> S, P, I, E, L -> E at position4? S1,P2,I3,E4,L5 -> so E at4? Good? Avoids C,R,A,N? S,P,I,E,L -> all seem okay.

But ""SPIEL"" has E at4? Yes.

Similarly, ""PIXEL"" -> P, I, X, E, L -> E at position4? P1,I2,X3,E4,L5? X is less common? But valid.

We could choose:

Option1: ELBOW (E1,L2,B3,O4,W5) -> tests E at position1.

Option2: FIELD (F1,I2,E3,L4,D5) -> tests E at position3.

Option3: SPIEL (S1,P2,I3,E4,L4 -> wait, L at5? Positions: 1=S, 2=P, 3=I, 4=E, 5=L? E at4? Good? Yes.

But SPIEL letters: S,P,I,E,L.

FIELD: F,I,E,L,D.

ELBOW: E,L,B,O,W.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test more common letters? Or aim for high frequency?

Common English letters after eliminating C,R,A,N: Remaining common letters: E (we know), S, T, L, O, I, M, P, etc.

Frequency-wise, S, T, L, O, I, M are common.

So FIELD: F and D? F is less common than S,T,O? FIELD has F,I,E,L,D? F and D are medium.

SPIEL: S,P,I,E,L? S and P are common? P is fairly common.

ELBOW: E,L,B,O,W? B and W? Less common? B is medium, W less.

Perhaps SPIEL? Or another word?

How about ""TIMES""? But E at5? Avoid.

""TOWER"": T,O,W,E,R -> has R? Excluded? Avoid.

""LOVES"": L,O,V,E,S -> E at4? Positions: L1,O2,V3,E4,S5? E at4? Avoids C,R,A? Includes S,V,O,L? V is less common? But avoid R.

""LOVES"" -> wait, V is used? But valid.

Alternatively, ""HOUSE"": H,O,U,S,E -> E at5? Bad? Avoid.

Okay, let's choose a word that also includes T? Since T is a very common letter.

Word: ""TEPID"" -> T,E,P,I,D -> positions: T1,E2,P3,I4,D5? E at2? Yes.

Also avoids C,R,A,N? Yes: T,E,P,I,D.

Better? Because E at position2? Previously E was guessed at position5, which was wrong, but now at position2? So we test E at position2? Good.

Similarly, ""PILED"": P,I,L,E,D -> E at position4? P1,I2,L3,E4,D5? But we have L? Same as others.

But TEPID starts with T? Common.

TEPID: letters T,E,P,I,D.

Frequency: T,E,P,I,D? All common? D is medium.

Alternatively, ""STILE"": S,T,I,L,E -> E at5? Avoid? Bad.

Another word: ""BELOW"" -> B,E,L,O,W -> positions: B1,E2,L3,O4,W5? So E at position2? Avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.

Letters: B,E,L,O,W? B and W? Less common? But E,L,O common.

We might choose TEPID or BELOW? Let's compare with possibilities.

Strategy: since E must be in the word, and not in position5, possibly in positions1-4, we want to test E in a new position? Guessing E at a different position will help locate E?

Currently, we know E is not in position5? So any position from 1 to 4 is possible. We don't have information on which one? Therefore, putting E at position2? For example? Might be useful.

I am considering ""TEPID"" because it has T, E, P, which are common? And avoids the excluded letters.

Another option is ""TILES"": T,I,L,E,S -> E at4? Positions: T1,I2,L3,E4,S5? E at4? Then S at5.

But ""TILES"" has E at4? Same as crane was E at5? We know E is wrong at position5? Not that it's not at5? So E can be anywhere else.

Yes?

But we want to test where E might be? By putting E in different position? Or use a word that has E and other common letters.

We also know that after this guess? We'll have more information.

So I think ""TEPID"" is a solid guess? It has T,E,P,I,D? All distinct and common? E at position2.

Similarly, ""SPITE"" has E at end? Avoid.

Let me decide: ""BELOW"" and ""TEPID"" both seem good? But BELOW has W? Which is less common? TEPID has T,E,P,I,D? I'll go with TEPID.

But TEPID: E is at position2? And we test letter for position1=T, position2=E? Etc.

Alternatively, since E can be anywhere? Another idea: use E in multiple potential positions? But no? Because word length is 5? We can only put E in one position? Unless we use a word with duplicates? But we avoid? Also, we don't know if E is repeated? Probably not? Assume no duplicates? We can try to avoid repeats to test more letters.

Therefore, TEPID: tests letters T, E, P, I, D? All unique? And E at a new position (2) compared to crane (which was position5).

So I'll go with ""tepid"".

But TEPID? Is it a 5-letter word? T-E-P-I-D? Yes.

Alternatively, another word? ""STEAL""? but has A? Excluded? Avoid.

""POISE"" -> P,O,I,S,E -> but E at5? Avoid.

So yes?

Alright, let's go with TEPID.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, N not in the word; E is in the word but not in position 5), the secret word must contain E in one of the first four positions and cannot contain C, R, A, or N. For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.
- Include E, but not in position 5 to test a new position (position 2 in this case).
- Test new common letters like T, P, I, and D.
The word ""tepid"" fits these criteria: E is in position 2, and it avoids the excluded letters while introducing T, P, I, and D.

<guess>tepid</guess>",tepid,"We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":

R(x) -> R is not in the word

Let me list words without C,R,A,N and with E not in position5:

Options:

- Position1: ELBOW (E,L,B,O,W) -> letters E,L,B,O,W

- Position1: EIGHT (E,I,G,H,T) -> E,I,G,H,T

- Position1: EMBOW (not common? better use common words)

Other E-position1: EAGER? But A excluded? EAGER has A? Yes, avoid.

EPOXY? E,P,O,X,Y? X and Y uncommon.

Let's try E-position2: words with ?E???

Possible words: ""GUESS"" -> G,U,E,S,S -> duplicates? And S repeated.

""STEEP"" -> S,T,E,E,P -> duplicates, E repeated.

""GROUP"" -> G,R,O,U P? GROUP has R? Excluded.

Avoid R.

Word: ""SLEPT"": S,L,E,P,T -> positions: S1, have E at position 3.

Also: ""FIELD"" -> F,I,E,L,D -> E at position 3? F1,I2,E3,L4,D5.

Avoids C,R,A,N? Yes: F,I,E,L,D? A absent but F,I,L,D not excluded? We don't know about F,I,L,D yet.

Similarly, ""PRIDE"" has R? Excluded.

""FIELD"" is F,I,E,L,D -> E at position3? Yes.

Alternatively, position4: ""LOUPE"" -> L,O,U,P,E -> but E at position5? Same? Avoid? ""LOUPE"" -> spelled L-O-U-P-E, so E at5? Bad.

If the word ends with E? Position5? Then we avoid.

How about ""APPLE"" -> A and P,P? A excluded? Not.

""STALE"" has A? Excluded.

Better: ""SPIEL"" -> S, P, I, E, L -> E at position4? S1,P2,I3,E4,L5 -> so E at4? Good? Avoids C,R,A,N? S,P,I,E,L -> all seem okay.

But ""SPIEL"" has E at4? Yes.

Similarly, ""PIXEL"" -> P, I, X, E, L -> E at position4? P1,I2,X3,E4,L5? X is less common? But valid.

We could choose:

Option1: ELBOW (E1,L2,B3,O4,W5) -> tests E at position1.

Option2: FIELD (F1,I2,E3,L4,D5) -> tests E at position3.

Option3: SPIEL (S1,P2,I3,E4,L4 -> wait, L at5? Positions: 1=S, 2=P, 3=I, 4=E, 5=L? E at4? Good? Yes.

But SPIEL letters: S,P,I,E,L.

FIELD: F,I,E,L,D.

ELBOW: E,L,B,O,W.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test more common letters? Or aim for high frequency?

Common English letters after eliminating C,R,A,N: Remaining common letters: E (we know), S, T, L, O, I, M, P, etc.

Frequency-wise, S, T, L, O, I, M are common.

So FIELD: F and D? F is less common than S,T,O? FIELD has F,I,E,L,D? F and D are medium.

SPIEL: S,P,I,E,L? S and P are common? P is fairly common.

ELBOW: E,L,B,O,W? B and W? Less common? B is medium, W less.

Perhaps SPIEL? Or another word?

How about ""TIMES""? But E at5? Avoid.

""TOWER"": T,O,W,E,R -> has R? Excluded? Avoid.

""LOVES"": L,O,V,E,S -> E at4? Positions: L1,O2,V3,E4,S5? E at4? Avoids C,R,A? Includes S,V,O,L? V is less common? But avoid R.

""LOVES"" -> wait, V is used? But valid.

Alternatively, ""HOUSE"": H,O,U,S,E -> E at5? Bad? Avoid.

Okay, let's choose a word that also includes T? Since T is a very common letter.

Word: ""TEPID"" -> T,E,P,I,D -> positions: T1,E2,P3,I4,D5? E at2? Yes.

Also avoids C,R,A,N? Yes: T,E,P,I,D.

Better? Because E at position2? Previously E was guessed at position5, which was wrong, but now at position2? So we test E at position2? Good.

Similarly, ""PILED"": P,I,L,E,D -> E at position4? P1,I2,L3,E4,D5? But we have L? Same as others.

But TEPID starts with T? Common.

TEPID: letters T,E,P,I,D.

Frequency: T,E,P,I,D? All common? D is medium.

Alternatively, ""STILE"": S,T,I,L,E -> E at5? Avoid? Bad.

Another word: ""BELOW"" -> B,E,L,O,W -> positions: B1,E2,L3,O4,W5? So E at position2? Avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.

Letters: B,E,L,O,W? B and W? Less common? But E,L,O common.

We might choose TEPID or BELOW? Let's compare with possibilities.

Strategy: since E must be in the word, and not in position5, possibly in positions1-4, we want to test E in a new position? Guessing E at a different position will help locate E?

Currently, we know E is not in position5? So any position from 1 to 4 is possible. We don't have information on which one? Therefore, putting E at position2? For example? Might be useful.

I am considering ""TEPID"" because it has T, E, P, which are common? And avoids the excluded letters.

Another option is ""TILES"": T,I,L,E,S -> E at4? Positions: T1,I2,L3,E4,S5? E at4? Then S at5.

But ""TILES"" has E at4? Same as crane was E at5? We know E is wrong at position5? Not that it's not at5? So E can be anywhere else.

Yes?

But we want to test where E might be? By putting E in different position? Or use a word that has E and other common letters.

We also know that after this guess? We'll have more information.

So I think ""TEPID"" is a solid guess? It has T,E,P,I,D? All distinct and common? E at position2.

Similarly, ""SPITE"" has E at end? Avoid.

Let me decide: ""BELOW"" and ""TEPID"" both seem good? But BELOW has W? Which is less common? TEPID has T,E,P,I,D? I'll go with TEPID.

But TEPID: E is at position2? And we test letter for position1=T, position2=E? Etc.

Alternatively, since E can be anywhere? Another idea: use E in multiple potential positions? But no? Because word length is 5? We can only put E in one position? Unless we use a word with duplicates? But we avoid? Also, we don't know if E is repeated? Probably not? Assume no duplicates? We can try to avoid repeats to test more letters.

Therefore, TEPID: tests letters T, E, P, I, D? All unique? And E at a new position (2) compared to crane (which was position5).

So I'll go with ""tepid"".

But TEPID? Is it a 5-letter word? T-E-P-I-D? Yes.

Alternatively, another word? ""STEAL""? but has A? Excluded? Avoid.

""POISE"" -> P,O,I,S,E -> but E at5? Avoid.

So yes?

Alright, let's go with TEPID.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, N not in the word; E is in the word but not in position 5), the secret word must contain E in one of the first four positions and cannot contain C, R, A, or N. For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.
- Include E, but not in position 5 to test a new position (position 2 in this case).
- Test new common letters like T, P, I, and D.
The word ""tepid"" fits these criteria: E is in position 2, and it avoids the excluded letters while introducing T, P, I, and D.",Guess 2: tepid -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(-) P(x) I(-) D(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,edify,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
C(x) -> C is not in the word
R(x) -> R is not in the word
A(x) -> A is not in the word
N(x) -> N is not in the word
E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So, the secret word contains the letter E, but not C, R, A, N. Also, since E is not in the last position (as per ""crane"" having E at the end), E might be in a different position.

We know the word has E somewhere, but not at the end (position 5). It could be at positions 1,2,3, or 4.

We need to make a new guess that does not include C, R, A, N, and must include E. Also, since E was in position 5 in ""crane"" and it's marked as wrong position, E is not in position 5. So E must be in one of the first four positions.

We should try to use common letters that haven't been tried yet. We have eliminated 4 consonants: C, R, A, N. And we know E is present.

Common vowels: We have E already, other common vowels are O, I, U. But we know A is out, so O, I, U might be candidates.

Common consonants: Some common consonants left: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

We should try a word that has E in one of the positions 1-4, and uses other common letters not yet excluded.

Possible positions for E: Let's try to place E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, without more information, we might spread our next guess to cover more ground.

A good strategy is to pick a word that includes E and other common letters, and avoids the known absent letters (C, R, A, N).

Let me think of words that have E and don't have C, R, A, N.

Example words:
- ""SPITE"": has S, P, I, T, E -> but E at the end, same position? We need to try E in a different position.
- ""TIMES"": E at the end again? Same as before.
We want a word where E is not at the end.

How about ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E -> E at the end again? Not good.

Let's try to have E at a different position.

Words with E in position 1: ""E"", then common letters? e.g., ""EAGLE"" but A is excluded? A is not in the word, so avoid A.

""EAGLE"" has A -> not allowed? We know A is absent, so we cannot use A.

Other words: ""EDGES"" -> E, D, G, E, S -> but repeats E? And we don't know if the word allows duplicates? The rules don't specify, but usually words can have repeated letters? However, let's avoid duplicates for now to cover more letters.

Options for E at position 1:
- ""E"" + ... without C,R,A,N: e.g., ""ELBOW"", ""EJECT"" (has C? C is excluded) -> ""EJECT"" has C and E? We know C is not in the word, so no.

Better: ""ELITE"" -> E, L, I, T, E -> but has two E's, and we don't know if the word has duplicate E's? Not ideal.

""EXIST"" -> E, X, I, S, T -> E at position 1? But X is less common? Still, possible.

But let's choose a word with more common letters.

Position 2: e.g., ""H"" + E + ... -> ""HELLO"" (has L and O? but also A? wait no, ""HELLO"" has H, E, L, L, O -> duplicates? Also, not 5 distinct letters? Wait, same as above.

Better word: ""PETAL"" -> P, E, T, A, L -> but A is absent, so we can't use A.

Avoid A.

Word: ""QUERY"" -> Q is too rare? Not ideal.

Word: ""STYLE"" -> S, T, Y, L, E -> E at the end? No, we need E not at the end. In STYLE, E is at the end? Position 5: STYLE: S position1, T2, Y3, L4, E5 -> same as crane? We want E in a different position.

To avoid E at the end, how about a word that doesn't end with E? For example, E in position 2 or 3 or 4.

Examples:

- Position 2: ""LEMON"" -> L, E, M, O, N -> wait, N is excluded? We know N is absent. So not.

- Position 2: ""BEGIN"" -> B, E, G, I, N -> N excluded? Not.

- Position 3: ""MODEM"" -> M, O, D, E, M -> duplicates? And N? No N? But duplicates.

- ""TOWEL"" -> T, O, W, E, L -> E is at position 4. So that's good.

TOWEL: T, O, W, E, L -> avoids C,R,A,N. Includes E at position 4 (so not position 5).

Alternatively, ""PILED"" -> P, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4? Positions: P1, I2, L3, E4, D5 -> so E is at position 4? Yes.

Still at a different position.

Another idea: use E in position 1: we haven't tried that. How about ""E"" at the beginning.

Words: ""EQUAL"", but U is vowel? And Q might be rare? Also has U and Q.

""ENSUE"" -> E, N, S, U, E -> but N is excluded? N is not allowed.

""ESTER"" -> E, S, T, E, R -> has R? R is excluded? We know R is absent. So not.

We must avoid C,R,A,N. So no R.

How about ""EIGHT"" -> E, I, G, H, T -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes: E,I,G,H,T. Position: E at1, so not at5.

Similarly, ""ELBOW"" -> E, L, B, O, W -> avoids C,R,A,N.

""ELBOW"": E at position1. Good.

Alternatively, ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E -> E at the end? Position5: same as crane? Not good? But we need to try E at a different position? Actually, crane had E at5, and it was not correct. But with E not at5, but it might be the same for SPIKE? We haven't tried E at5 again? But the feedback said E is in the word but wrong position, meaning E is in the word but not at position5? Therefore, E must be in positions 1,2,3, or4.

Therefore, if we use a word that has E at position5 again, we expect it to be wrong? Yes, so we shouldn't put E at position5 because we know it is not there.

We need to choose a word where E is at positions 1,2,3, or4.

Among the choices:

""ELBOW"": E at position1 -> good? But ""ELBOW"" has E at1? Yes.

""TOWEL"": T,O,W,E,L -> E at position4? Yes.

""QUOTE"": Q, U, O, T, E -> E at5? No, avoid? Because we know E is not at5.

""QUOTE"" ends with E? Position5? Then same? Avoid.

""WHILE"": W, H, I, L, E -> E at5? Avoid.

""BRIDE"": B, R, I, D, E -> has R? R is excluded. Also E at5? Bad.

Let me list words without C,R,A,N and with E not in position5:

Options:

- Position1: ELBOW (E,L,B,O,W) -> letters E,L,B,O,W

- Position1: EIGHT (E,I,G,H,T) -> E,I,G,H,T

- Position1: EMBOW (not common? better use common words)

Other E-position1: EAGER? But A excluded? EAGER has A? Yes, avoid.

EPOXY? E,P,O,X,Y? X and Y uncommon.

Let's try E-position2: words with ?E???

Possible words: ""GUESS"" -> G,U,E,S,S -> duplicates? And S repeated.

""STEEP"" -> S,T,E,E,P -> duplicates, E repeated.

""GROUP"" -> G,R,O,U P? GROUP has R? Excluded.

Avoid R.

Word: ""SLEPT"": S,L,E,P,T -> positions: S1, have E at position 3.

Also: ""FIELD"" -> F,I,E,L,D -> E at position 3? F1,I2,E3,L4,D5.

Avoids C,R,A,N? Yes: F,I,E,L,D? A absent but F,I,L,D not excluded? We don't know about F,I,L,D yet.

Similarly, ""PRIDE"" has R? Excluded.

""FIELD"" is F,I,E,L,D -> E at position3? Yes.

Alternatively, position4: ""LOUPE"" -> L,O,U,P,E -> but E at position5? Same? Avoid? ""LOUPE"" -> spelled L-O-U-P-E, so E at5? Bad.

If the word ends with E? Position5? Then we avoid.

How about ""APPLE"" -> A and P,P? A excluded? Not.

""STALE"" has A? Excluded.

Better: ""SPIEL"" -> S, P, I, E, L -> E at position4? S1,P2,I3,E4,L5 -> so E at4? Good? Avoids C,R,A,N? S,P,I,E,L -> all seem okay.

But ""SPIEL"" has E at4? Yes.

Similarly, ""PIXEL"" -> P, I, X, E, L -> E at position4? P1,I2,X3,E4,L5? X is less common? But valid.

We could choose:

Option1: ELBOW (E1,L2,B3,O4,W5) -> tests E at position1.

Option2: FIELD (F1,I2,E3,L4,D5) -> tests E at position3.

Option3: SPIEL (S1,P2,I3,E4,L4 -> wait, L at5? Positions: 1=S, 2=P, 3=I, 4=E, 5=L? E at4? Good? Yes.

But SPIEL letters: S,P,I,E,L.

FIELD: F,I,E,L,D.

ELBOW: E,L,B,O,W.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test more common letters? Or aim for high frequency?

Common English letters after eliminating C,R,A,N: Remaining common letters: E (we know), S, T, L, O, I, M, P, etc.

Frequency-wise, S, T, L, O, I, M are common.

So FIELD: F and D? F is less common than S,T,O? FIELD has F,I,E,L,D? F and D are medium.

SPIEL: S,P,I,E,L? S and P are common? P is fairly common.

ELBOW: E,L,B,O,W? B and W? Less common? B is medium, W less.

Perhaps SPIEL? Or another word?

How about ""TIMES""? But E at5? Avoid.

""TOWER"": T,O,W,E,R -> has R? Excluded? Avoid.

""LOVES"": L,O,V,E,S -> E at4? Positions: L1,O2,V3,E4,S5? E at4? Avoids C,R,A? Includes S,V,O,L? V is less common? But avoid R.

""LOVES"" -> wait, V is used? But valid.

Alternatively, ""HOUSE"": H,O,U,S,E -> E at5? Bad? Avoid.

Okay, let's choose a word that also includes T? Since T is a very common letter.

Word: ""TEPID"" -> T,E,P,I,D -> positions: T1,E2,P3,I4,D5? E at2? Yes.

Also avoids C,R,A,N? Yes: T,E,P,I,D.

Better? Because E at position2? Previously E was guessed at position5, which was wrong, but now at position2? So we test E at position2? Good.

Similarly, ""PILED"": P,I,L,E,D -> E at position4? P1,I2,L3,E4,D5? But we have L? Same as others.

But TEPID starts with T? Common.

TEPID: letters T,E,P,I,D.

Frequency: T,E,P,I,D? All common? D is medium.

Alternatively, ""STILE"": S,T,I,L,E -> E at5? Avoid? Bad.

Another word: ""BELOW"" -> B,E,L,O,W -> positions: B1,E2,L3,O4,W5? So E at position2? Avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.

Letters: B,E,L,O,W? B and W? Less common? But E,L,O common.

We might choose TEPID or BELOW? Let's compare with possibilities.

Strategy: since E must be in the word, and not in position5, possibly in positions1-4, we want to test E in a new position? Guessing E at a different position will help locate E?

Currently, we know E is not in position5? So any position from 1 to 4 is possible. We don't have information on which one? Therefore, putting E at position2? For example? Might be useful.

I am considering ""TEPID"" because it has T, E, P, which are common? And avoids the excluded letters.

Another option is ""TILES"": T,I,L,E,S -> E at4? Positions: T1,I2,L3,E4,S5? E at4? Then S at5.

But ""TILES"" has E at4? Same as crane was E at5? We know E is wrong at position5? Not that it's not at5? So E can be anywhere else.

Yes?

But we want to test where E might be? By putting E in different position? Or use a word that has E and other common letters.

We also know that after this guess? We'll have more information.

So I think ""TEPID"" is a solid guess? It has T,E,P,I,D? All distinct and common? E at position2.

Similarly, ""SPITE"" has E at end? Avoid.

Let me decide: ""BELOW"" and ""TEPID"" both seem good? But BELOW has W? Which is less common? TEPID has T,E,P,I,D? I'll go with TEPID.

But TEPID: E is at position2? And we test letter for position1=T, position2=E? Etc.

Alternatively, since E can be anywhere? Another idea: use E in multiple potential positions? But no? Because word length is 5? We can only put E in one position? Unless we use a word with duplicates? But we avoid? Also, we don't know if E is repeated? Probably not? Assume no duplicates? We can try to avoid repeats to test more letters.

Therefore, TEPID: tests letters T, E, P, I, D? All unique? And E at a new position (2) compared to crane (which was position5).

So I'll go with ""tepid"".

But TEPID? Is it a 5-letter word? T-E-P-I-D? Yes.

Alternatively, another word? ""STEAL""? but has A? Excluded? Avoid.

""POISE"" -> P,O,I,S,E -> but E at5? Avoid.

So yes?

Alright, let's go with TEPID.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, N not in the word; E is in the word but not in position 5), the secret word must contain E in one of the first four positions and cannot contain C, R, A, or N. For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.
- Include E, but not in position 5 to test a new position (position 2 in this case).
- Test new common letters like T, P, I, and D.
The word ""tepid"" fits these criteria: E is in position 2, and it avoids the excluded letters while introducing T, P, I, and D.

However, without more information, we might spread our next guess to cover more ground.\n\nA good strategy is to pick a word that includes E and other common letters, and avoids the known absent letters (C, R, A, N).\n\nLet me think of words that have E and don\'t have C, R, A, N.\n\nExample words:\n- ""SPITE"": has S, P, I, T, E -> but E at the end, same position? We need to try E in a different position.\n- ""TIMES"": E at the end again? Same as before.\nWe want a word where E is not at the end.\n\nHow about ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E -> E at the end again? Not good.\n\nLet\'s try to have E at a different position.\n\nWords with E in position 1: ""E"", then common letters? e.g., ""EAGLE"" but A is excluded? A is not in the word, so avoid A.\n\n""EAGLE"" has A -> not allowed? We know A is absent, so we cannot use A.\n\nOther words: ""EDGES"" -> E, D, G, E, S -> but repeats E? And we don\'t know if the word allows duplicates? The rules don\'t specify, but usually words can have repeated letters? However, let\'s avoid duplicates for now to cover more letters.\n\nOptions for E at position 1:\n- ""E"" + ... without C,R,A,N: e.g., ""ELBOW"", ""EJECT"" (has C? C is excluded) -> ""EJECT"" has C and E? We know C is not in the word, so no.\n\nBetter: ""ELITE"" -> E, L, I, T, E -> but has two E\'s, and we don\'t know if the word has duplicate E\'s? Not ideal.\n\n""EXIST"" -> E, X, I, S, T -> E at position 1? But X is less common? Still, possible.\n\nBut let\'s choose a word with more common letters.\n\nPosition 2: e.g., ""H"" + E + ... -> ""HELLO"" (has L and O? but also A? wait no, ""HELLO"" has H, E, L, L, O -> duplicates? Also, not 5 distinct letters? Wait, same as above.\n\nBetter word: ""PETAL"" -> P, E, T, A, L -> but A is absent, so we can\'t use A.\n\nAvoid A.\n\nWord: ""QUERY"" -> Q is too rare? Not ideal.\n\nWord: ""STYLE"" -> S, T, Y, L, E -> E at the end? No, we need E not at the end. In STYLE, E is at the end? Position 5: STYLE: S position1, T2, Y3, L4, E5 -> same as crane? We want E in a different position.\n\nTo avoid E at the end, how about a word that doesn\'t end with E? For example, E in position 2 or 3 or 4.\n\nExamples:\n\n- Position 2: ""LEMON"" -> L, E, M, O, N -> wait, N is excluded? We know N is absent. So not.\n\n- Position 2: ""BEGIN"" -> B, E, G, I, N -> N excluded? Not.\n\n- Position 3: ""MODEM"" -> M, O, D, E, M -> duplicates? And N? No N? But duplicates.\n\n- ""TOWEL"" -> T, O, W, E, L -> E is at position 4. So that\'s good.\n\nTOWEL: T, O, W, E, L -> avoids C,R,A,N. Includes E at position 4 (so not position 5).\n\nAlternatively, ""PILED"" -> P, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4? Positions: P1, I2, L3, E4, D5 -> so E is at position 4? Yes.\n\nStill at a different position.\n\nAnother idea: use E in position 1: we haven\'t tried that. How about ""E"" at the beginning.\n\nWords: ""EQUAL"", but U is vowel? And Q might be rare? Also has U and Q.\n\n""ENSUE"" -> E, N, S, U, E -> but N is excluded? N is not allowed.\n\n""ESTER"" -> E, S, T, E, R -> has R? R is excluded? We know R is absent. So not.\n\nWe must avoid C,R,A,N. So no R.\n\nHow about ""EIGHT"" -> E, I, G, H, T -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes: E,I,G,H,T. Position: E at1, so not at5.\n\nSimilarly, ""ELBOW"" -> E, L, B, O, W -> avoids C,R,A,N.\n\n""ELBOW"": E at position1. Good.\n\nAlternatively, ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E -> E at the end? Position5: same as crane? Not good? But we need to try E at a different position? Actually, crane had E at5, and it was not correct. But with E not at5, but it might be the same for SPIKE? We haven\'t tried E at5 again? But the feedback said E is in the word but wrong position, meaning E is in the word but not at position5? Therefore, E must be in positions 1,2,3, or4.\n\nTherefore, if we use a word that has E at position5 again, we expect it to be wrong? Yes, so we shouldn\'t put E at position5 because we know it is not there.\n\nWe need to choose a word where E is at positions 1,2,3, or4.\n\nAmong the choices:\n\n""ELBOW"": E at position1 -> good? But ""ELBOW"" has E at1? Yes.\n\n""TOWEL"": T,O,W,E,L -> E at position4? Yes.\n\n""QUOTE"": Q, U, O, T, E -> E at5? No, avoid? Because we know E is not at5.\n\n""QUOTE"" ends with E? Position5? Then same? Avoid.\n\n""WHILE"": W, H, I, L, E -> E at5? Avoid.\n\n""BRIDE"": B, R, I, D, E -> has R? R is excluded. Also E at5? Bad.\n\nLet me list words without C,R,A,N and with E not in position5:\n\nOptions:\n\n- Position1: ELBOW (E,L,B,O,W) -> letters E,L,B,O,W\n\n- Position1: EIGHT (E,I,G,H,T) -> E,I,G,H,T\n\n- Position1: EMBOW (not common? better use common words)\n\nOther E-position1: EAGER? But A excluded? EAGER has A? Yes, avoid.\n\nEPOXY? E,P,O,X,Y? X and Y uncommon.\n\nLet\'s try E-position2: words with ?E???\n\nPossible words: ""GUESS"" -> G,U,E,S,S -> duplicates? And S repeated.\n\n""STEEP"" -> S,T,E,E,P -> duplicates, E repeated.\n\n""GROUP"" -> G,R,O,U P? GROUP has R? Excluded.\n\nAvoid R.\n\nWord: ""SLEPT"": S,L,E,P,T -> positions: S1, have E at position 3.\n\nAlso: ""FIELD"" -> F,I,E,L,D -> E at position 3? F1,I2,E3,L4,D5.\n\nAvoids C,R,A,N? Yes: F,I,E,L,D? A absent but F,I,L,D not excluded? We don\'t know about F,I,L,D yet.\n\nSimilarly, ""PRIDE"" has R? Excluded.\n\n""FIELD"" is F,I,E,L,D -> E at position3? Yes.\n\nAlternatively, position4: ""LOUPE"" -> L,O,U,P,E -> but E at position5? Same? Avoid? ""LOUPE"" -> spelled L-O-U-P-E, so E at5? Bad.\n\nIf the word ends with E? Position5? Then we avoid.\n\nHow about ""APPLE"" -> A and P,P? A excluded? Not.\n\n""STALE"" has A? Excluded.\n\nBetter: ""SPIEL"" -> S, P, I, E, L -> E at position4? S1,P2,I3,E4,L5 -> so E at4? Good? Avoids C,R,A,N? S,P,I,E,L -> all seem okay.\n\nBut ""SPIEL"" has E at4? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""PIXEL"" -> P, I, X, E, L -> E at position4? P1,I2,X3,E4,L5? X is less common? But valid.\n\nWe could choose:\n\nOption1: ELBOW (E1,L2,B3,O4,W5) -> tests E at position1.\n\nOption2: FIELD (F1,I2,E3,L4,D5) -> tests E at position3.\n\nOption3: SPIEL (S1,P2,I3,E4,L4 -> wait, L at5? Positions: 1=S, 2=P, 3=I, 4=E, 5=L? E at4? Good? Yes.\n\nBut SPIEL letters: S,P,I,E,L.\n\nFIELD: F,I,E,L,D.\n\nELBOW: E,L,B,O,W.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test more common letters? Or aim for high frequency?\n\nCommon English letters after eliminating C,R,A,N: Remaining common letters: E (we know), S, T, L, O, I, M, P, etc.\n\nFrequency-wise, S, T, L, O, I, M are common.\n\nSo FIELD: F and D? F is less common than S,T,O? FIELD has F,I,E,L,D? F and D are medium.\n\nSPIEL: S,P,I,E,L? S and P are common? P is fairly common.\n\nELBOW: E,L,B,O,W? B and W? Less common? B is medium, W less.\n\nPerhaps SPIEL? Or another word?\n\nHow about ""TIMES""? But E at5? Avoid.\n\n""TOWER"": T,O,W,E,R -> has R? Excluded? Avoid.\n\n""LOVES"": L,O,V,E,S -> E at4? Positions: L1,O2,V3,E4,S5? E at4? Avoids C,R,A? Includes S,V,O,L? V is less common? But avoid R.\n\n""LOVES"" -> wait, V is used? But valid.\n\nAlternatively, ""HOUSE"": H,O,U,S,E -> E at5? Bad? Avoid.\n\nOkay, let\'s choose a word that also includes T? Since T is a very common letter.\n\nWord: ""TEPID"" -> T,E,P,I,D -> positions: T1,E2,P3,I4,D5? E at2? Yes.\n\nAlso avoids C,R,A,N? Yes: T,E,P,I,D.\n\nBetter? Because E at position2? Previously E was guessed at position5, which was wrong, but now at position2? So we test E at position2? Good.\n\nSimilarly, ""PILED"": P,I,L,E,D -> E at position4? P1,I2,L3,E4,D5? But we have L? Same as others.\n\nBut TEPID starts with T? Common.\n\nTEPID: letters T,E,P,I,D.\n\nFrequency: T,E,P,I,D? All common? D is medium.\n\nAlternatively, ""STILE"": S,T,I,L,E -> E at5? Avoid? Bad.\n\nAnother word: ""BELOW"" -> B,E,L,O,W -> positions: B1,E2,L3,O4,W5? So E at position2? Avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.\n\nLetters: B,E,L,O,W? B and W? Less common? But E,L,O common.\n\nWe might choose TEPID or BELOW? Let\'s compare with possibilities.\n\nStrategy: since E must be in the word, and not in position5, possibly in positions1-4, we want to test E in a new position? Guessing E at a different position will help locate E?\n\nCurrently, we know E is not in position5? So any position from 1 to 4 is possible. We don\'t have information on which one? Therefore, putting E at position2? For example? Might be useful.\n\nI am considering ""TEPID"" because it has T, E, P, which are common? And avoids the excluded letters.\n\nAnother option is ""TILES"": T,I,L,E,S -> E at4? Positions: T1,I2,L3,E4,S5? E at4? Then S at5.\n\nBut ""TILES"" has E at4? Same as crane was E at5? We know E is wrong at position5? Not that it\'s not at5? So E can be anywhere else.\n\nYes?\n\nBut we want to test where E might be? By putting E in different position? Or use a word that has E and other common letters.\n\nWe also know that after this guess? We\'ll have more information.\n\nSo I think ""TEPID"" is a solid guess? It has T,E,P,I,D? All distinct and common? E at position2.\n\nSimilarly, ""SPITE"" has E at end? Avoid.\n\nLet me decide: ""BELOW"" and ""TEPID"" both seem good? But BELOW has W? Which is less common? TEPID has T,E,P,I,D? I\'ll go with TEPID.\n\nBut TEPID: E is at position2? And we test letter for position1=T, position2=E? Etc.\n\nAlternatively, since E can be anywhere? Another idea: use E in multiple potential positions? But no? Because word length is 5? We can only put E in one position? Unless we use a word with duplicates? But we avoid? Also, we don\'t know if E is repeated? Probably not? Assume no duplicates? We can try to avoid repeats to test more letters.\n\nTherefore, TEPID: tests letters T, E, P, I, D? All unique? And E at a new position (2) compared to crane (which was position5).\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""tepid"".\n\nBut TEPID? Is it a 5-letter word? T-E-P-I-D? Yes.\n\nAlternatively, another word? ""STEAL""? but has A? Excluded? Avoid.\n\n""POISE"" -> P,O,I,S,E -> but E at5? Avoid.\n\nSo yes?\n\nAlright, let\'s go with TEPID.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, N not in the word; E is in the word but not in position 5), the secret word must contain E in one of the first four positions and cannot contain C, R, A, or N. For the next guess:\n- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.\n- Include E, but not in position 5 to test a new position (position 2 in this case).\n- Test new common letters like T, P, I, and D.\nThe word ""tepid"" fits these criteria: E is in position 2, and it avoids the excluded letters while introducing T, P, I, and D.\n\n<guess>tepid</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tepid -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(-) P(x) I(-) D(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (where it was in ""crane"").

Guess 2: tepid -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(-) P(x) I(-) D(-)
Meaning:
- T and P are not in the word at all.
- E, I, D are in the word but not in their guessed positions:
  - E is not in position 2 (where it was in ""tepid"").
  - I is not in position 4 (where it was in ""tepid"").
  - D is not in position 5 (where it was in ""tepid"").

Recall that E is already known to be in the word and not in position 5 (from first guess). Now we also know E is not in position 2.

From the first guess, we know the word has E and it is not in position 5. From the second guess, E is also not in position 2. Therefore, for the next guess, E must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.

Additionally, we now know that I and D are present in the word, but:
- I is not in position 4 (from second guess).
- D is not in position 5 (from second guess).

Also, we know that T and P are absent (since marked with x).

So far, we have eliminated the following letters: C, R, A, N, T, P.
And we have confirmed present letters: E, I, D.

Therefore, the secret word must contain E, I, D, and two other letters that we haven't tried yet.

For these other letters, we should avoid: C, R, A, N, T, P.

We also know about the positions:

For E:
- Not position 2 (from tepid) and not position 5 (from crane), so must be at 1, 3, or 4.

For I:
- From tepid, I was guessed at position 4 and was wrong position, so I is not in position 4.

For D:
- From tepid, D was guessed at position 5 and was wrong position, so D is not in position 5.

Now, our next step: we need to make a guess that includes E, I, D, and two other letters not eliminated. Also, we need to place E in either position 1, 3, or 4; I not in 4; D not in 5.

We should try to place these letters in positions that are still possible to gather more information.

One strategy is to put E in position 1 (since we haven't tested position 1 for E) and also test other common letters.

But also consider that I and D must be placed in different positions.

Let's list possible positions for E: 1,3,4
For I: cannot be 4, so positions 1,2,3,5
For D: cannot be 5, so positions 1,2,3,4

We might also want to test other common letters: like L, O, S, U, M, etc. Avoiding C,R,A,N,T,P.

We can try a word that uses E, I, D and two new letters, say S and L?

But we need to form a valid English word.

Possible word: ""FIELD"" -> but FIELD has F,I,E,L,D? However, P is excluded? Yes, FIELD avoids C,R,A,N,T,P? FIELD: F,I,E,L,D -> all letters permitted? Yes, but F and L are not tested yet? Also, remember that E is at position 3? Let's see:

In ""FIELD"": F(1), I(2), E(3), L(4), D(5)
But for E: we are placing it at position 3? Then we can verify if E is at position 3? Or if it should be elsewhere? And I at2? D at5? But from feedback, D is NOT in position 5? So if we put D at position 5? That would be invalid? Because we know D is not at position 5? Therefore, we should not put D at position 5.

So ""FIELD"" would put D at5? But we know D is not at5? So we must avoid that.

Similarly, we cannot put any known misplaced letter at the same position again? Thus, for D, we must avoid position 5? And for I, avoid position 4? And for E, avoid positions 2 and 5.

Therefore, for D: place it in positions 1,2,3,4? But specifically, in the next guess, we should not put D at5? Because it's wrong? Similarly, not I at4.

So another word: let's think of a word that includes E, I, D?

With E in position1? For example: ""EDIFY"" -> E,D,I,F,Y? Positions: E1,D2,I3,F4,Y5? Then E at1? D at2? I at3? But we don't know about F and Y? Also, is EDIFY a common word? Maybe.

But let's check the positions: E at1? Then we test if E is at1? Also, D at position2? This might be premature? Since D could be elsewhere? Similarly for I at position3.

But at least we are testing E at position1? Which we haven't before.

If E is at1? We might get feedback? If E is at1? Then it gets ✓? Otherwise not? Same with other letters.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that places E in a new position and introduces other common letters.

Another word: ""SIDE"" but that's 4 letters? Need 5 letters? ""SIDED""? Duplicate D? Not ideal? Better unique letters? Or not? But we haven't rule out duplicates? But avoid to test more letters.

Word: ""DEISM"" -> D,E,I,S,M? Positions: D1,E2,I3,S4,M5? But E at position2? We know E is not at position2? From the tepid feedback? Because tepid had E at2 and it was marked as -. So E is definitely not at2? Therefore, we cannot put E at2 in ""DEISM""? Because E2 would be wrong? But we are trying to test? If we put E at2, we know it's not there? But that would waste a position? So better avoid positions that we know are invalid? And instead put E in positions we haven't ruled out? i.e., 1,3,4.

Therefore, ""DEISM"" has E at2? Avoid.

Similarly, ""DETAIL"" has 6 letters? No? 6? D-E-T-A-I-L? That's 6? Not.

""DITZY""? D,I,T,Z,Y? But T is excluded? T is at position4? T is marked absent? So we cannot use T? So avoid.

Another idea: ""JEWEL""? J,E,W,E,L -> duplicate E? And no D or I.

Not including I or D? We must include E, I, D? Because they are present? To make progress.

But we need to include E? And I? And D? In the guess? Because we know they are in the word? But we are not required to? However, if we don't include them? We won't get information about their positions? Since we are limited to 6 guesses? But in Wordle? Often it's beneficial to use the known letters? To pin down their positions? So I think we should include all three: E, I, D? And add two new letters.

So let's form a word that has E, I, D? and two other letters? And places E in position 1 or 3 or 4? Avoid D at5? Avoid I at4.

For E at position1: words starting with E? Then E, then ...? Including I and D? E.g., ""EDITS"" -> E,D,I,T,S? But T is excluded? We know T is absent? So not.

""EDICT""? But T again? And C excluded? C not allowed? And T excluded.

""ELOID""? Not common? Not valid.

""ENFIM""? No.

""EQUID""? Not common? Q.

Not working? How about E in position3:

Then letters at pos3: E? So pattern like ..E..? Then include I and D? E.g., ""MIXED"" -> M,I,X,E,D? Is X common? Or ""SIZED""? S,I,Z,E,D? Z less common? But valid.

""SIZED"": S1, I2, Z3, E4, D5? But E at position4? Then D at position5? But we know D is not at position5? From tepid? So avoid? Cannot put D at5.

Similarly, ""LINED"" -> L,I,N,E,D? But N is excluded? N not in word? From crane? So avoid.

""TIMED"" -> T,I,M,E,D? But T excluded? And I at1? Position: T1,I2,M3,E4,D5? But E at4? D at5? which is invalid? And T excluded? Not.

Then E at position3 and D not at5? So D must be placed in 1,2,3,4? But position3 is E? Then D elsewhere? And I somewhere? For example, position1 D? Then D first? Then E at3? Like ""D"", something, E, something? And I not at4.

For example: ""DUNES"" -> D,U,N,E,S? N excluded? Avoid.

""DAMES"" -> D,A,M,E,S? A excluded? Avoid.

""DOZES"" -> D,O,Z,E,S? Then S at the end? D1,O2,Z3,E4,S5? Then E at4? D at1? So pattern D? O? Z? E? S? But positions: E at position4? Then D at position1? And S at5? But D is known misplaced? But we haven't tested D at1? So okay? Similarly, Z is less common? But avoid D at5? Which we are not.

But also need to include I? ""DOZES"" doesn't have I? Not include I? But we must test I? Not necessarily? But we know I is in the word? So we should include it? To find its position? Otherwise, after the guess? We still don't know about I? And we have limited tries.

Therefore, we need a word that includes E, I, D? And places E in 1,3,4? Avoids I at4? Avoids D at5? And avoids positions that would repeat known errors? But we also must avoid eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,T,P.

Let's try E in position1:

Words: E + ? ? ? ? including I and D? E.g.,  E,I,D + two letters? Like E,?,I,?,D? But D not at5? If D is at4? Then pattern E ? I ? D? Or D at3? Then E ? D I ? Etc.

For example: ""ELDIN"" not common.

""EXCID"" not valid.

""EDWIN"" -> E,D,W,I,N? But N excluded? Avoid.

""EDUCe"" has 5? E,D,U,C,E? C excluded? And duplicate E? Avoid.

Not easy? So E at position3.

Then pattern ??E??, include I and D? And avoid N,A, etc.

And D not at5? So D must be at positions 1,2,4.

Also I not at4? So I can be at 1,2,5.

For letters: two of them at first two positions? Then E at3? Then two more? With I and D somewhere.

For example: if D at1, then D ? E I ? ? say ""D "" + something + E + I + ? but avoid position5 for D and position4 for I? D can be at1, I can be at position5? For example, ""D?E?I"" ... but let's think or use a word like ""DUELL"" not? ""DWELL"" -> D,W,E,L,L? Duplicate L? And no I? Not.

""MODEL"" -> M,O,D,E,L? But includes O? But no I? Not.

""QUIDE"" - not valid.

Another idea: E in position4? Then pattern ??? E? Then include I and D? With D not at5? So D must be at 1,2,3? But position4 is E? So D at 1,2,3? And I somewhere? For example, ""SEDUM"" ? S,E,D,U,M? But E at2? Which we know is wrong? Avoid? ""SEDUM"" has E at position2? Which is also invalid? So not.

"" ABIDE"" has A? Excluded? Avoid.

""GLIDE"" G,L,I,D,E? Then E at5? But avoid E at5? Because not there? So not allowed.

""OXIDE"" O,X,I,D,E? Positions: O1,X2,I3,D4,E5? Then E at5? Avoid? And position4 is D? Which is tested? Similarly E at5? Bad.

""BRIDE"" has R and B? R excluded? Avoid.

""PRIDE"" has P and R? Both excluded.

""SLIDE"" S,L,I,D,E? E at5? Avoid.

""TIMID"" T,I,M,I,D? T excluded? And duplicate I? Not.

Not successful? Let's try E at position1 again.

Perhaps ""IDIOM"" but no E? Not required? But we need to include E somehow.

Another word: ""DEVELO"" too long.

""DEVIL"" D,E,V,I,L? That's 5 letters: D,E,V,I,L? Positions: D1,E2,V3,I4,L5? But E at position2? Invalid? We know E not at2? So we cannot use E at2? In this word, E is at position2? So it's not allowed? Because we know E not at2? Therefore, we must avoid putting E in position2 in our guess.

So for ""DEVIL"", E is at2? Bad.

Similarly, ""DEVEL"" not common? And E at position2? Bad.

What if we look for words where E is at position4? And D at position1 or 2 or 3?

For example: "" "" + D + ? + E + ? but include I? And avoid D at5? Position4 is E? Then D can be at1,2 or3? And I can be at1,2,3,5? But not at4? Because position4 is E? So I cannot be at4? Which is fine? But we have to have I elsewhere.

Say D at position3? Then pattern ? ? D E ? and include I at1 or2 or5.
For example: ""ADIEU"" has A? Excluded? Avoid.
""ODIEU"" not word.

""MEDIA"" M,E,D,I,A? But A excluded? And E at position2? Bad.

""VALID"" V,A,L,I,D? A excluded? Avoid.

""SOWED"" S,O,W,E,D? But E at4? D at5? But D cannot be at5? Avoid.

So we have to avoid D at5? So for E at4, D must be at 1,2,3.

If E is at position4, then D cannot be at5? Should be at1,2,3.

How about "" "" + I + ? + E + ? and D at1,2,3? For example, ""IDE"" at beginning? ""IDEAL""? 6 letters? ""IDENT"" has T? Excluded.

""IDE"", but three letters? Need two more? ""id est"" is two words?

This is difficult? Perhaps use less common letters or accept some less common words.

Another idea: E in position3? Then let's say some examples: ""LOVED"" L,O,V,E,D? But D at5? Bad and E at4? L1,O2,V3,E4,D5? E at4? Then we can use this? Positions: E at position4? In LOVED? And D at5? But D at5 invalid? Avoid.

""MOVED"" M,O,V,E,D? Same issue? D at5.

""JADED"" J,A,D,E,D? A excluded? Duplicate D? Not.

""BIDET"" B,I,D,E,T? But T excluded? And E at4? B1,I2,D3,E4,T5? positions: I at2, D at3, E at4? D at3 is okay? But T excluded? Avoid.

""WIDES""  W,I,D,E,S? Positions: W1,I2,D3,E4,S5? Then E at4? And E is not at2? Which is good? D at3? Avoids D at5? But also includes S? And avoids eliminated letters? W at1? S at5.

But the word doesn't have a letter for position3? It does: positions 1W, 2I, 3D, 4E, 5S? So E at position4? Which hasn't been tested for position4? And D at position3? which is new? And I at position2? Which is new? And  eliminates W and S if needed.

Also, it uses E at4? D at3? I at2? and includes new letters W and S? S is common? W less.

The word ""WIDES"" is valid? Meaning wide (noun) and s? Or more commonly, ""wides"" in cricket? But we can use it? Or ""SIDEW"" not a word.

Similarly, ""HIDES"" H,I,D,E,S? Similarly, H1,I2,D3,E4,S5? Then H instead of W.

But H is a common letter? We haven't tested H yet? So perhaps ""HIDES"" or ""WIDES"".

""HIDES"": H,I,D,E,S? With H at1, I at2, D at3, E at4, S at5.

Now, feedback constraints:
- E is at position4? and we know E is not at2 or5? But it can be at4? Yes.
- D is at position3? not at5? Allowed.
- I is at position2? and we know I is not at4? Which is fine? Because we put it at2.

Also, avoids C,R,A,N,T,P? H,I,D,E,S? None of these excluded? So yes.

But we are not forced to use E at4? We could have used at1 or3? But this works? And it will give us information about the positions.

Similarly, ""QUEST"" has U,E,S,T? T excluded? Avoid.

So I think ""HIDES"" is a good guess. Or ""HIDES"" to test more common letters.

Another word: ""SHIED"" S,H,I,E,D? Positions: S1,H2,I3,E4,D5? But D is at position5? Which we know is invalid? Avoid? Cannot.

So ""HIDES"" has D at3? Avoids D at5? And E at position4? Which is a possible position? And I at2? New position? And adds H and S.

Therefore, a good option.

We might also do ""SIZED"" but Z is less common? And D at5? Bad? No, in SIZED: S1,I2,Z3,E4,D5 -> D at5? Invalid? So must avoid.

Therefore, ""HIDES"" seems usable.

Or ""MINED"" has M,I,N,E,D? N excluded? Avoid.

""LIVED"" L,I,V,E,D? But E at4? D at5? Invalid for D? Avoid.

Another possibility: ""DEBIT"" D,E,B,I,T? But T excluded? And E at2? Invalid? Avoid.

""BEING"" B,E,I,N,G? N excluded? Avoid.

So I think ""HIDES"" is appropriate: H,I,D,E,S

In ""HIDES"":
- Position1: H
- Position2: I
- Position3: D
- Position4: E
- Position5: S

With these:
- I is at2? Which is new? Not previously tested position? And we know I is in the word? But not position4? Now tested at2.
- D at3? New? Previously tested at5? Now avoid that? So okay.
- E at4? Previously at5 and2? And those were wrong? Now testing at4? Which is new.

And includes new letters H and S.

So for third guess: ""hides"" 

But is ""HIDES"" a valid English word? Yes, plural of hide? Or verb? For example, ""hides"" as in skin? Or hides from view? Yes.

So we'll go with ""hides"".
</think>
Based on the feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N (not in word). E is present but not in position 5 (since marked as wrong position).
- **Guess 2: tepid** → Eliminated letters: T, P (not in word). E is present but not in position 2. I is present but not in position 4. D is present but not in position 5.

### Key Information:
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: E, I, D.
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, T, P.
- **Position constraints**:
  - E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (must be in 1, 3, or 4).
  - I cannot be in position 4 (must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5).
  - D cannot be in position 5 (must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4).
- **Remaining guesses**: 4 left (after this one).

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- Must include E, I, D to test positions and confirm the word structure.
- Avoid eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, T, P) and positions disallowed for E, I, D.
- Prioritize placing E in position 4 (an untested valid position: 1, 3, or 4). Place I and D in new positions:
  - I not in position 4 → placed in position 2 (untested).
  - D not in position 5 → placed in position 3 (untested).
- Introduce new common letters to gather more data. ""S"" and ""H"" are high-frequency letters not yet tested.
- ""HIDES"" was selected as the guess:
  - E is in position 4 (test new position).
  - I is in position 2 (test new position, since position 4 is invalid).
  - D is in position 3 (test new position, since position 5 is invalid).
  - New letters: H (position 1) and S (position 5) → high coverage.

This guess efficiently tests E, I, D placement while adding new letters, helping narrow down the word faster.

<guess>hides</guess>",hides,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (where it was in ""crane"").

Guess 2: tepid -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(-) P(x) I(-) D(-)
Meaning:
- T and P are not in the word at all.
- E, I, D are in the word but not in their guessed positions:
  - E is not in position 2 (where it was in ""tepid"").
  - I is not in position 4 (where it was in ""tepid"").
  - D is not in position 5 (where it was in ""tepid"").

Recall that E is already known to be in the word and not in position 5 (from first guess). Now we also know E is not in position 2.

From the first guess, we know the word has E and it is not in position 5. From the second guess, E is also not in position 2. Therefore, for the next guess, E must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.

Additionally, we now know that I and D are present in the word, but:
- I is not in position 4 (from second guess).
- D is not in position 5 (from second guess).

Also, we know that T and P are absent (since marked with x).

So far, we have eliminated the following letters: C, R, A, N, T, P.
And we have confirmed present letters: E, I, D.

Therefore, the secret word must contain E, I, D, and two other letters that we haven't tried yet.

For these other letters, we should avoid: C, R, A, N, T, P.

We also know about the positions:

For E:
- Not position 2 (from tepid) and not position 5 (from crane), so must be at 1, 3, or 4.

For I:
- From tepid, I was guessed at position 4 and was wrong position, so I is not in position 4.

For D:
- From tepid, D was guessed at position 5 and was wrong position, so D is not in position 5.

Now, our next step: we need to make a guess that includes E, I, D, and two other letters not eliminated. Also, we need to place E in either position 1, 3, or 4; I not in 4; D not in 5.

We should try to place these letters in positions that are still possible to gather more information.

One strategy is to put E in position 1 (since we haven't tested position 1 for E) and also test other common letters.

But also consider that I and D must be placed in different positions.

Let's list possible positions for E: 1,3,4
For I: cannot be 4, so positions 1,2,3,5
For D: cannot be 5, so positions 1,2,3,4

We might also want to test other common letters: like L, O, S, U, M, etc. Avoiding C,R,A,N,T,P.

We can try a word that uses E, I, D and two new letters, say S and L?

But we need to form a valid English word.

Possible word: ""FIELD"" -> but FIELD has F,I,E,L,D? However, P is excluded? Yes, FIELD avoids C,R,A,N,T,P? FIELD: F,I,E,L,D -> all letters permitted? Yes, but F and L are not tested yet? Also, remember that E is at position 3? Let's see:

In ""FIELD"": F(1), I(2), E(3), L(4), D(5)
But for E: we are placing it at position 3? Then we can verify if E is at position 3? Or if it should be elsewhere? And I at2? D at5? But from feedback, D is NOT in position 5? So if we put D at position 5? That would be invalid? Because we know D is not at position 5? Therefore, we should not put D at position 5.

So ""FIELD"" would put D at5? But we know D is not at5? So we must avoid that.

Similarly, we cannot put any known misplaced letter at the same position again? Thus, for D, we must avoid position 5? And for I, avoid position 4? And for E, avoid positions 2 and 5.

Therefore, for D: place it in positions 1,2,3,4? But specifically, in the next guess, we should not put D at5? Because it's wrong? Similarly, not I at4.

So another word: let's think of a word that includes E, I, D?

With E in position1? For example: ""EDIFY"" -> E,D,I,F,Y? Positions: E1,D2,I3,F4,Y5? Then E at1? D at2? I at3? But we don't know about F and Y? Also, is EDIFY a common word? Maybe.

But let's check the positions: E at1? Then we test if E is at1? Also, D at position2? This might be premature? Since D could be elsewhere? Similarly for I at position3.

But at least we are testing E at position1? Which we haven't before.

If E is at1? We might get feedback? If E is at1? Then it gets ✓? Otherwise not? Same with other letters.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that places E in a new position and introduces other common letters.

Another word: ""SIDE"" but that's 4 letters? Need 5 letters? ""SIDED""? Duplicate D? Not ideal? Better unique letters? Or not? But we haven't rule out duplicates? But avoid to test more letters.

Word: ""DEISM"" -> D,E,I,S,M? Positions: D1,E2,I3,S4,M5? But E at position2? We know E is not at position2? From the tepid feedback? Because tepid had E at2 and it was marked as -. So E is definitely not at2? Therefore, we cannot put E at2 in ""DEISM""? Because E2 would be wrong? But we are trying to test? If we put E at2, we know it's not there? But that would waste a position? So better avoid positions that we know are invalid? And instead put E in positions we haven't ruled out? i.e., 1,3,4.

Therefore, ""DEISM"" has E at2? Avoid.

Similarly, ""DETAIL"" has 6 letters? No? 6? D-E-T-A-I-L? That's 6? Not.

""DITZY""? D,I,T,Z,Y? But T is excluded? T is at position4? T is marked absent? So we cannot use T? So avoid.

Another idea: ""JEWEL""? J,E,W,E,L -> duplicate E? And no D or I.

Not including I or D? We must include E, I, D? Because they are present? To make progress.

But we need to include E? And I? And D? In the guess? Because we know they are in the word? But we are not required to? However, if we don't include them? We won't get information about their positions? Since we are limited to 6 guesses? But in Wordle? Often it's beneficial to use the known letters? To pin down their positions? So I think we should include all three: E, I, D? And add two new letters.

So let's form a word that has E, I, D? and two other letters? And places E in position 1 or 3 or 4? Avoid D at5? Avoid I at4.

For E at position1: words starting with E? Then E, then ...? Including I and D? E.g., ""EDITS"" -> E,D,I,T,S? But T is excluded? We know T is absent? So not.

""EDICT""? But T again? And C excluded? C not allowed? And T excluded.

""ELOID""? Not common? Not valid.

""ENFIM""? No.

""EQUID""? Not common? Q.

Not working? How about E in position3:

Then letters at pos3: E? So pattern like ..E..? Then include I and D? E.g., ""MIXED"" -> M,I,X,E,D? Is X common? Or ""SIZED""? S,I,Z,E,D? Z less common? But valid.

""SIZED"": S1, I2, Z3, E4, D5? But E at position4? Then D at position5? But we know D is not at position5? From tepid? So avoid? Cannot put D at5.

Similarly, ""LINED"" -> L,I,N,E,D? But N is excluded? N not in word? From crane? So avoid.

""TIMED"" -> T,I,M,E,D? But T excluded? And I at1? Position: T1,I2,M3,E4,D5? But E at4? D at5? which is invalid? And T excluded? Not.

Then E at position3 and D not at5? So D must be placed in 1,2,3,4? But position3 is E? Then D elsewhere? And I somewhere? For example, position1 D? Then D first? Then E at3? Like ""D"", something, E, something? And I not at4.

For example: ""DUNES"" -> D,U,N,E,S? N excluded? Avoid.

""DAMES"" -> D,A,M,E,S? A excluded? Avoid.

""DOZES"" -> D,O,Z,E,S? Then S at the end? D1,O2,Z3,E4,S5? Then E at4? D at1? So pattern D? O? Z? E? S? But positions: E at position4? Then D at position1? And S at5? But D is known misplaced? But we haven't tested D at1? So okay? Similarly, Z is less common? But avoid D at5? Which we are not.

But also need to include I? ""DOZES"" doesn't have I? Not include I? But we must test I? Not necessarily? But we know I is in the word? So we should include it? To find its position? Otherwise, after the guess? We still don't know about I? And we have limited tries.

Therefore, we need a word that includes E, I, D? And places E in 1,3,4? Avoids I at4? Avoids D at5? And avoids positions that would repeat known errors? But we also must avoid eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,T,P.

Let's try E in position1:

Words: E + ? ? ? ? including I and D? E.g.,  E,I,D + two letters? Like E,?,I,?,D? But D not at5? If D is at4? Then pattern E ? I ? D? Or D at3? Then E ? D I ? Etc.

For example: ""ELDIN"" not common.

""EXCID"" not valid.

""EDWIN"" -> E,D,W,I,N? But N excluded? Avoid.

""EDUCe"" has 5? E,D,U,C,E? C excluded? And duplicate E? Avoid.

Not easy? So E at position3.

Then pattern ??E??, include I and D? And avoid N,A, etc.

And D not at5? So D must be at positions 1,2,4.

Also I not at4? So I can be at 1,2,5.

For letters: two of them at first two positions? Then E at3? Then two more? With I and D somewhere.

For example: if D at1, then D ? E I ? ? say ""D "" + something + E + I + ? but avoid position5 for D and position4 for I? D can be at1, I can be at position5? For example, ""D?E?I"" ... but let's think or use a word like ""DUELL"" not? ""DWELL"" -> D,W,E,L,L? Duplicate L? And no I? Not.

""MODEL"" -> M,O,D,E,L? But includes O? But no I? Not.

""QUIDE"" - not valid.

Another idea: E in position4? Then pattern ??? E? Then include I and D? With D not at5? So D must be at 1,2,3? But position4 is E? So D at 1,2,3? And I somewhere? For example, ""SEDUM"" ? S,E,D,U,M? But E at2? Which we know is wrong? Avoid? ""SEDUM"" has E at position2? Which is also invalid? So not.

"" ABIDE"" has A? Excluded? Avoid.

""GLIDE"" G,L,I,D,E? Then E at5? But avoid E at5? Because not there? So not allowed.

""OXIDE"" O,X,I,D,E? Positions: O1,X2,I3,D4,E5? Then E at5? Avoid? And position4 is D? Which is tested? Similarly E at5? Bad.

""BRIDE"" has R and B? R excluded? Avoid.

""PRIDE"" has P and R? Both excluded.

""SLIDE"" S,L,I,D,E? E at5? Avoid.

""TIMID"" T,I,M,I,D? T excluded? And duplicate I? Not.

Not successful? Let's try E at position1 again.

Perhaps ""IDIOM"" but no E? Not required? But we need to include E somehow.

Another word: ""DEVELO"" too long.

""DEVIL"" D,E,V,I,L? That's 5 letters: D,E,V,I,L? Positions: D1,E2,V3,I4,L5? But E at position2? Invalid? We know E not at2? So we cannot use E at2? In this word, E is at position2? So it's not allowed? Because we know E not at2? Therefore, we must avoid putting E in position2 in our guess.

So for ""DEVIL"", E is at2? Bad.

Similarly, ""DEVEL"" not common? And E at position2? Bad.

What if we look for words where E is at position4? And D at position1 or 2 or 3?

For example: "" "" + D + ? + E + ? but include I? And avoid D at5? Position4 is E? Then D can be at1,2 or3? And I can be at1,2,3,5? But not at4? Because position4 is E? So I cannot be at4? Which is fine? But we have to have I elsewhere.

Say D at position3? Then pattern ? ? D E ? and include I at1 or2 or5.
For example: ""ADIEU"" has A? Excluded? Avoid.
""ODIEU"" not word.

""MEDIA"" M,E,D,I,A? But A excluded? And E at position2? Bad.

""VALID"" V,A,L,I,D? A excluded? Avoid.

""SOWED"" S,O,W,E,D? But E at4? D at5? But D cannot be at5? Avoid.

So we have to avoid D at5? So for E at4, D must be at 1,2,3.

If E is at position4, then D cannot be at5? Should be at1,2,3.

How about "" "" + I + ? + E + ? and D at1,2,3? For example, ""IDE"" at beginning? ""IDEAL""? 6 letters? ""IDENT"" has T? Excluded.

""IDE"", but three letters? Need two more? ""id est"" is two words?

This is difficult? Perhaps use less common letters or accept some less common words.

Another idea: E in position3? Then let's say some examples: ""LOVED"" L,O,V,E,D? But D at5? Bad and E at4? L1,O2,V3,E4,D5? E at4? Then we can use this? Positions: E at position4? In LOVED? And D at5? But D at5 invalid? Avoid.

""MOVED"" M,O,V,E,D? Same issue? D at5.

""JADED"" J,A,D,E,D? A excluded? Duplicate D? Not.

""BIDET"" B,I,D,E,T? But T excluded? And E at4? B1,I2,D3,E4,T5? positions: I at2, D at3, E at4? D at3 is okay? But T excluded? Avoid.

""WIDES""  W,I,D,E,S? Positions: W1,I2,D3,E4,S5? Then E at4? And E is not at2? Which is good? D at3? Avoids D at5? But also includes S? And avoids eliminated letters? W at1? S at5.

But the word doesn't have a letter for position3? It does: positions 1W, 2I, 3D, 4E, 5S? So E at position4? Which hasn't been tested for position4? And D at position3? which is new? And I at position2? Which is new? And  eliminates W and S if needed.

Also, it uses E at4? D at3? I at2? and includes new letters W and S? S is common? W less.

The word ""WIDES"" is valid? Meaning wide (noun) and s? Or more commonly, ""wides"" in cricket? But we can use it? Or ""SIDEW"" not a word.

Similarly, ""HIDES"" H,I,D,E,S? Similarly, H1,I2,D3,E4,S5? Then H instead of W.

But H is a common letter? We haven't tested H yet? So perhaps ""HIDES"" or ""WIDES"".

""HIDES"": H,I,D,E,S? With H at1, I at2, D at3, E at4, S at5.

Now, feedback constraints:
- E is at position4? and we know E is not at2 or5? But it can be at4? Yes.
- D is at position3? not at5? Allowed.
- I is at position2? and we know I is not at4? Which is fine? Because we put it at2.

Also, avoids C,R,A,N,T,P? H,I,D,E,S? None of these excluded? So yes.

But we are not forced to use E at4? We could have used at1 or3? But this works? And it will give us information about the positions.

Similarly, ""QUEST"" has U,E,S,T? T excluded? Avoid.

So I think ""HIDES"" is a good guess. Or ""HIDES"" to test more common letters.

Another word: ""SHIED"" S,H,I,E,D? Positions: S1,H2,I3,E4,D5? But D is at position5? Which we know is invalid? Avoid? Cannot.

So ""HIDES"" has D at3? Avoids D at5? And E at position4? Which is a possible position? And I at2? New position? And adds H and S.

Therefore, a good option.

We might also do ""SIZED"" but Z is less common? And D at5? Bad? No, in SIZED: S1,I2,Z3,E4,D5 -> D at5? Invalid? So must avoid.

Therefore, ""HIDES"" seems usable.

Or ""MINED"" has M,I,N,E,D? N excluded? Avoid.

""LIVED"" L,I,V,E,D? But E at4? D at5? Invalid for D? Avoid.

Another possibility: ""DEBIT"" D,E,B,I,T? But T excluded? And E at2? Invalid? Avoid.

""BEING"" B,E,I,N,G? N excluded? Avoid.

So I think ""HIDES"" is appropriate: H,I,D,E,S

In ""HIDES"":
- Position1: H
- Position2: I
- Position3: D
- Position4: E
- Position5: S

With these:
- I is at2? Which is new? Not previously tested position? And we know I is in the word? But not position4? Now tested at2.
- D at3? New? Previously tested at5? Now avoid that? So okay.
- E at4? Previously at5 and2? And those were wrong? Now testing at4? Which is new.

And includes new letters H and S.

So for third guess: ""hides"" 

But is ""HIDES"" a valid English word? Yes, plural of hide? Or verb? For example, ""hides"" as in skin? Or hides from view? Yes.

So we'll go with ""hides"".Based on the feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N (not in word). E is present but not in position 5 (since marked as wrong position).
- **Guess 2: tepid** → Eliminated letters: T, P (not in word). E is present but not in position 2. I is present but not in position 4. D is present but not in position 5.

### Key Information:
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: E, I, D.
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, T, P.
- **Position constraints**:
  - E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (must be in 1, 3, or 4).
  - I cannot be in position 4 (must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5).

- **Remaining guesses**: 4 left (after this one).

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- Must include E, I, D to test positions and confirm the word structure.
- Avoid eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, T, P) and positions disallowed for E, I, D.
- Prioritize placing E in position 4 (an untested valid position: 1, 3, or 4). Place I and D in new positions:
  - I not in position 4 → placed in position 2 (untested).

  - D is in position 3 (test new position, since position 5 is invalid).
  - New letters: H (position 1) and S (position 5) → high coverage.

This guess efficiently tests E, I, D placement while adding new letters, helping narrow down the word faster.",Guess 3: hides -> FEEDBACK: H(x) I(-) D(-) E(-) S(x),FAIL

So, the secret word contains the letter E, but not C, R, A, N. Also, since E is not in the last position (as per ""crane"" having E at the end), E might be in a different position.

We know the word has E somewhere, but not at the end (position 5). It could be at positions 1,2,3, or 4.

We need to make a new guess that does not include C, R, A, N, and must include E. Also, since E was in position 5 in ""crane"" and it's marked as wrong position, E is not in position 5. So E must be in one of the first four positions.

We should try to use common letters that haven't been tried yet. We have eliminated 4 consonants: C, R, A, N. And we know E is present.

Common vowels: We have E already, other common vowels are O, I, U. But we know A is out, so O, I, U might be candidates.

Common consonants: Some common consonants left: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

We should try a word that has E in one of the positions 1-4, and uses other common letters not yet excluded.

Possible positions for E: Let's try to place E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, without more information, we might spread our next guess to cover more ground.

A good strategy is to pick a word that includes E and other common letters, and avoids the known absent letters (C, R, A, N).

Let me think of words that have E and don't have C, R, A, N.

Example words:
- ""SPITE"": has S, P, I, T, E -> but E at the end, same position? We need to try E in a different position.
- ""TIMES"": E at the end again? Same as before.
We want a word where E is not at the end.

How about ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E -> E at the end again? Not good.

Let's try to have E at a different position.

Words with E in position 1: ""E"", then common letters? e.g., ""EAGLE"" but A is excluded? A is not in the word, so avoid A.

""EAGLE"" has A -> not allowed? We know A is absent, so we cannot use A.

Other words: ""EDGES"" -> E, D, G, E, S -> but repeats E? And we don't know if the word allows duplicates? The rules don't specify, but usually words can have repeated letters? However, let's avoid duplicates for now to cover more letters.

Options for E at position 1:
- ""E"" + ... without C,R,A,N: e.g., ""ELBOW"", ""EJECT"" (has C? C is excluded) -> ""EJECT"" has C and E? We know C is not in the word, so no.

Better: ""ELITE"" -> E, L, I, T, E -> but has two E's, and we don't know if the word has duplicate E's? Not ideal.

""EXIST"" -> E, X, I, S, T -> E at position 1? But X is less common? Still, possible.

But let's choose a word with more common letters.

Position 2: e.g., ""H"" + E + ... -> ""HELLO"" (has L and O? but also A? wait no, ""HELLO"" has H, E, L, L, O -> duplicates? Also, not 5 distinct letters? Wait, same as above.

Better word: ""PETAL"" -> P, E, T, A, L -> but A is absent, so we can't use A.

Avoid A.

Word: ""QUERY"" -> Q is too rare? Not ideal.

Word: ""STYLE"" -> S, T, Y, L, E -> E at the end? No, we need E not at the end. In STYLE, E is at the end? Position 5: STYLE: S position1, T2, Y3, L4, E5 -> same as crane? We want E in a different position.

To avoid E at the end, how about a word that doesn't end with E? For example, E in position 2 or 3 or 4.

Examples:

- Position 2: ""LEMON"" -> L, E, M, O, N -> wait, N is excluded? We know N is absent. So not.

- Position 2: ""BEGIN"" -> B, E, G, I, N -> N excluded? Not.

- Position 3: ""MODEM"" -> M, O, D, E, M -> duplicates? And N? No N? But duplicates.

- ""TOWEL"" -> T, O, W, E, L -> E is at position 4. So that's good.

TOWEL: T, O, W, E, L -> avoids C,R,A,N. Includes E at position 4 (so not position 5).

Alternatively, ""PILED"" -> P, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4? Positions: P1, I2, L3, E4, D5 -> so E is at position 4? Yes.

Still at a different position.

Another idea: use E in position 1: we haven't tried that. How about ""E"" at the beginning.

Words: ""EQUAL"", but U is vowel? And Q might be rare? Also has U and Q.

""ENSUE"" -> E, N, S, U, E -> but N is excluded? N is not allowed.

""ESTER"" -> E, S, T, E, R -> has R? R is excluded? We know R is absent. So not.

We must avoid C,R,A,N. So no R.

How about ""EIGHT"" -> E, I, G, H, T -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes: E,I,G,H,T. Position: E at1, so not at5.

Similarly, ""ELBOW"" -> E, L, B, O, W -> avoids C,R,A,N.

""ELBOW"": E at position1. Good.

Alternatively, ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E -> E at the end? Position5: same as crane? Not good? But we need to try E at a different position? Actually, crane had E at5, and it was not correct. But with E not at5, but it might be the same for SPIKE? We haven't tried E at5 again? But the feedback said E is in the word but wrong position, meaning E is in the word but not at position5? Therefore, E must be in positions 1,2,3, or4.

Therefore, if we use a word that has E at position5 again, we expect it to be wrong? Yes, so we shouldn't put E at position5 because we know it is not there.

We need to choose a word where E is at positions 1,2,3, or4.

Among the choices:

""ELBOW"": E at position1 -> good? But ""ELBOW"" has E at1? Yes.

""TOWEL"": T,O,W,E,L -> E at position4? Yes.

""QUOTE"": Q, U, O, T, E -> E at5? No, avoid? Because we know E is not at5.

""QUOTE"" ends with E? Position5? Then same? Avoid.

""WHILE"": W, H, I, L, E -> E at5? Avoid.

""BRIDE"": B, R, I, D, E -> has R? R is excluded. Also E at5? Bad.

Let me list words without C,R,A,N and with E not in position5:

Options:

- Position1: ELBOW (E,L,B,O,W) -> letters E,L,B,O,W

- Position1: EIGHT (E,I,G,H,T) -> E,I,G,H,T

- Position1: EMBOW (not common? better use common words)

Other E-position1: EAGER? But A excluded? EAGER has A? Yes, avoid.

EPOXY? E,P,O,X,Y? X and Y uncommon.

Let's try E-position2: words with ?E???

Possible words: ""GUESS"" -> G,U,E,S,S -> duplicates? And S repeated.

""STEEP"" -> S,T,E,E,P -> duplicates, E repeated.

""GROUP"" -> G,R,O,U P? GROUP has R? Excluded.

Avoid R.

Word: ""SLEPT"": S,L,E,P,T -> positions: S1, have E at position 3.

Also: ""FIELD"" -> F,I,E,L,D -> E at position 3? F1,I2,E3,L4,D5.

Avoids C,R,A,N? Yes: F,I,E,L,D? A absent but F,I,L,D not excluded? We don't know about F,I,L,D yet.

Similarly, ""PRIDE"" has R? Excluded.

""FIELD"" is F,I,E,L,D -> E at position3? Yes.

Alternatively, position4: ""LOUPE"" -> L,O,U,P,E -> but E at position5? Same? Avoid? ""LOUPE"" -> spelled L-O-U-P-E, so E at5? Bad.

If the word ends with E? Position5? Then we avoid.

How about ""APPLE"" -> A and P,P? A excluded? Not.

""STALE"" has A? Excluded.

Better: ""SPIEL"" -> S, P, I, E, L -> E at position4? S1,P2,I3,E4,L5 -> so E at4? Good? Avoids C,R,A,N? S,P,I,E,L -> all seem okay.

But ""SPIEL"" has E at4? Yes.

Similarly, ""PIXEL"" -> P, I, X, E, L -> E at position4? P1,I2,X3,E4,L5? X is less common? But valid.

We could choose:

Option1: ELBOW (E1,L2,B3,O4,W5) -> tests E at position1.

Option2: FIELD (F1,I2,E3,L4,D5) -> tests E at position3.

Option3: SPIEL (S1,P2,I3,E4,L4 -> wait, L at5? Positions: 1=S, 2=P, 3=I, 4=E, 5=L? E at4? Good? Yes.

But SPIEL letters: S,P,I,E,L.

FIELD: F,I,E,L,D.

ELBOW: E,L,B,O,W.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test more common letters? Or aim for high frequency?

Common English letters after eliminating C,R,A,N: Remaining common letters: E (we know), S, T, L, O, I, M, P, etc.

Frequency-wise, S, T, L, O, I, M are common.

So FIELD: F and D? F is less common than S,T,O? FIELD has F,I,E,L,D? F and D are medium.

SPIEL: S,P,I,E,L? S and P are common? P is fairly common.

ELBOW: E,L,B,O,W? B and W? Less common? B is medium, W less.

Perhaps SPIEL? Or another word?

How about ""TIMES""? But E at5? Avoid.

""TOWER"": T,O,W,E,R -> has R? Excluded? Avoid.

""LOVES"": L,O,V,E,S -> E at4? Positions: L1,O2,V3,E4,S5? E at4? Avoids C,R,A? Includes S,V,O,L? V is less common? But avoid R.

""LOVES"" -> wait, V is used? But valid.

Alternatively, ""HOUSE"": H,O,U,S,E -> E at5? Bad? Avoid.

Okay, let's choose a word that also includes T? Since T is a very common letter.

Word: ""TEPID"" -> T,E,P,I,D -> positions: T1,E2,P3,I4,D5? E at2? Yes.

Also avoids C,R,A,N? Yes: T,E,P,I,D.

Better? Because E at position2? Previously E was guessed at position5, which was wrong, but now at position2? So we test E at position2? Good.

Similarly, ""PILED"": P,I,L,E,D -> E at position4? P1,I2,L3,E4,D5? But we have L? Same as others.

But TEPID starts with T? Common.

TEPID: letters T,E,P,I,D.

Frequency: T,E,P,I,D? All common? D is medium.

Alternatively, ""STILE"": S,T,I,L,E -> E at5? Avoid? Bad.

Another word: ""BELOW"" -> B,E,L,O,W -> positions: B1,E2,L3,O4,W5? So E at position2? Avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.

Letters: B,E,L,O,W? B and W? Less common? But E,L,O common.

We might choose TEPID or BELOW? Let's compare with possibilities.

Strategy: since E must be in the word, and not in position5, possibly in positions1-4, we want to test E in a new position? Guessing E at a different position will help locate E?

Currently, we know E is not in position5? So any position from 1 to 4 is possible. We don't have information on which one? Therefore, putting E at position2? For example? Might be useful.

I am considering ""TEPID"" because it has T, E, P, which are common? And avoids the excluded letters.

Another option is ""TILES"": T,I,L,E,S -> E at4? Positions: T1,I2,L3,E4,S5? E at4? Then S at5.

But ""TILES"" has E at4? Same as crane was E at5? We know E is wrong at position5? Not that it's not at5? So E can be anywhere else.

Yes?

But we want to test where E might be? By putting E in different position? Or use a word that has E and other common letters.

We also know that after this guess? We'll have more information.

So I think ""TEPID"" is a solid guess? It has T,E,P,I,D? All distinct and common? E at position2.

Similarly, ""SPITE"" has E at end? Avoid.

Let me decide: ""BELOW"" and ""TEPID"" both seem good? But BELOW has W? Which is less common? TEPID has T,E,P,I,D? I'll go with TEPID.

But TEPID: E is at position2? And we test letter for position1=T, position2=E? Etc.

Alternatively, since E can be anywhere? Another idea: use E in multiple potential positions? But no? Because word length is 5? We can only put E in one position? Unless we use a word with duplicates? But we avoid? Also, we don't know if E is repeated? Probably not? Assume no duplicates? We can try to avoid repeats to test more letters.

Therefore, TEPID: tests letters T, E, P, I, D? All unique? And E at a new position (2) compared to crane (which was position5).

So I'll go with ""tepid"".

But TEPID? Is it a 5-letter word? T-E-P-I-D? Yes.

Alternatively, another word? ""STEAL""? but has A? Excluded? Avoid.

""POISE"" -> P,O,I,S,E -> but E at5? Avoid.

So yes?

Alright, let's go with TEPID.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, N not in the word; E is in the word but not in position 5), the secret word must contain E in one of the first four positions and cannot contain C, R, A, or N. For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.
- Include E, but not in position 5 to test a new position (position 2 in this case).
- Test new common letters like T, P, I, and D.
The word ""tepid"" fits these criteria: E is in position 2, and it avoids the excluded letters while introducing T, P, I, and D.

<guess>tepid</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tepid -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(-) P(x) I(-) D(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (where it was in ""crane"").

Guess 2: tepid -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(-) P(x) I(-) D(-)
Meaning:
- T and P are not in the word at all.
- E, I, D are in the word but not in their guessed positions:
  - E is not in position 2 (where it was in ""tepid"").
  - I is not in position 4 (where it was in ""tepid"").
  - D is not in position 5 (where it was in ""tepid"").

Recall that E is already known to be in the word and not in position 5 (from first guess). Now we also know E is not in position 2.

From the first guess, we know the word has E and it is not in position 5. From the second guess, E is also not in position 2. Therefore, for the next guess, E must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.

Additionally, we now know that I and D are present in the word, but:
- I is not in position 4 (from second guess).
- D is not in position 5 (from second guess).

Also, we know that T and P are absent (since marked with x).

So far, we have eliminated the following letters: C, R, A, N, T, P.
And we have confirmed present letters: E, I, D.

Therefore, the secret word must contain E, I, D, and two other letters that we haven't tried yet.

For these other letters, we should avoid: C, R, A, N, T, P.

We also know about the positions:

For E:
- Not position 2 (from tepid) and not position 5 (from crane), so must be at 1, 3, or 4.

For I:
- From tepid, I was guessed at position 4 and was wrong position, so I is not in position 4.

For D:
- From tepid, D was guessed at position 5 and was wrong position, so D is not in position 5.

Now, our next step: we need to make a guess that includes E, I, D, and two other letters not eliminated. Also, we need to place E in either position 1, 3, or 4; I not in 4; D not in 5.

We should try to place these letters in positions that are still possible to gather more information.

One strategy is to put E in position 1 (since we haven't tested position 1 for E) and also test other common letters.

But also consider that I and D must be placed in different positions.

Let's list possible positions for E: 1,3,4
For I: cannot be 4, so positions 1,2,3,5
For D: cannot be 5, so positions 1,2,3,4

We might also want to test other common letters: like L, O, S, U, M, etc. Avoiding C,R,A,N,T,P.

We can try a word that uses E, I, D and two new letters, say S and L?

But we need to form a valid English word.

Possible word: ""FIELD"" -> but FIELD has F,I,E,L,D? However, P is excluded? Yes, FIELD avoids C,R,A,N,T,P? FIELD: F,I,E,L,D -> all letters permitted? Yes, but F and L are not tested yet? Also, remember that E is at position 3? Let's see:

In ""FIELD"": F(1), I(2), E(3), L(4), D(5)
But for E: we are placing it at position 3? Then we can verify if E is at position 3? Or if it should be elsewhere? And I at2? D at5? But from feedback, D is NOT in position 5? So if we put D at position 5? That would be invalid? Because we know D is not at position 5? Therefore, we should not put D at position 5.

So ""FIELD"" would put D at5? But we know D is not at5? So we must avoid that.

Similarly, we cannot put any known misplaced letter at the same position again? Thus, for D, we must avoid position 5? And for I, avoid position 4? And for E, avoid positions 2 and 5.

Therefore, for D: place it in positions 1,2,3,4? But specifically, in the next guess, we should not put D at5? Because it's wrong? Similarly, not I at4.

So another word: let's think of a word that includes E, I, D?

With E in position1? For example: ""EDIFY"" -> E,D,I,F,Y? Positions: E1,D2,I3,F4,Y5? Then E at1? D at2? I at3? But we don't know about F and Y? Also, is EDIFY a common word? Maybe.

But let's check the positions: E at1? Then we test if E is at1? Also, D at position2? This might be premature? Since D could be elsewhere? Similarly for I at position3.

But at least we are testing E at position1? Which we haven't before.

If E is at1? We might get feedback? If E is at1? Then it gets ✓? Otherwise not? Same with other letters.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that places E in a new position and introduces other common letters.

Another word: ""SIDE"" but that's 4 letters? Need 5 letters? ""SIDED""? Duplicate D? Not ideal? Better unique letters? Or not? But we haven't rule out duplicates? But avoid to test more letters.

Word: ""DEISM"" -> D,E,I,S,M? Positions: D1,E2,I3,S4,M5? But E at position2? We know E is not at position2? From the tepid feedback? Because tepid had E at2 and it was marked as -. So E is definitely not at2? Therefore, we cannot put E at2 in ""DEISM""? Because E2 would be wrong? But we are trying to test? If we put E at2, we know it's not there? But that would waste a position? So better avoid positions that we know are invalid? And instead put E in positions we haven't ruled out? i.e., 1,3,4.

Therefore, ""DEISM"" has E at2? Avoid.

Similarly, ""DETAIL"" has 6 letters? No? 6? D-E-T-A-I-L? That's 6? Not.

""DITZY""? D,I,T,Z,Y? But T is excluded? T is at position4? T is marked absent? So we cannot use T? So avoid.

Another idea: ""JEWEL""? J,E,W,E,L -> duplicate E? And no D or I.

Not including I or D? We must include E, I, D? Because they are present? To make progress.

But we need to include E? And I? And D? In the guess? Because we know they are in the word? But we are not required to? However, if we don't include them? We won't get information about their positions? Since we are limited to 6 guesses? But in Wordle? Often it's beneficial to use the known letters? To pin down their positions? So I think we should include all three: E, I, D? And add two new letters.

So let's form a word that has E, I, D? and two other letters? And places E in position 1 or 3 or 4? Avoid D at5? Avoid I at4.

For E at position1: words starting with E? Then E, then ...? Including I and D? E.g., ""EDITS"" -> E,D,I,T,S? But T is excluded? We know T is absent? So not.

""EDICT""? But T again? And C excluded? C not allowed? And T excluded.

""ELOID""? Not common? Not valid.

""ENFIM""? No.

""EQUID""? Not common? Q.

Not working? How about E in position3:

Then letters at pos3: E? So pattern like ..E..? Then include I and D? E.g., ""MIXED"" -> M,I,X,E,D? Is X common? Or ""SIZED""? S,I,Z,E,D? Z less common? But valid.

""SIZED"": S1, I2, Z3, E4, D5? But E at position4? Then D at position5? But we know D is not at position5? From tepid? So avoid? Cannot put D at5.

Similarly, ""LINED"" -> L,I,N,E,D? But N is excluded? N not in word? From crane? So avoid.

""TIMED"" -> T,I,M,E,D? But T excluded? And I at1? Position: T1,I2,M3,E4,D5? But E at4? D at5? which is invalid? And T excluded? Not.

Then E at position3 and D not at5? So D must be placed in 1,2,3,4? But position3 is E? Then D elsewhere? And I somewhere? For example, position1 D? Then D first? Then E at3? Like ""D"", something, E, something? And I not at4.

For example: ""DUNES"" -> D,U,N,E,S? N excluded? Avoid.

""DAMES"" -> D,A,M,E,S? A excluded? Avoid.

""DOZES"" -> D,O,Z,E,S? Then S at the end? D1,O2,Z3,E4,S5? Then E at4? D at1? So pattern D? O? Z? E? S? But positions: E at position4? Then D at position1? And S at5? But D is known misplaced? But we haven't tested D at1? So okay? Similarly, Z is less common? But avoid D at5? Which we are not.

But also need to include I? ""DOZES"" doesn't have I? Not include I? But we must test I? Not necessarily? But we know I is in the word? So we should include it? To find its position? Otherwise, after the guess? We still don't know about I? And we have limited tries.

Therefore, we need a word that includes E, I, D? And places E in 1,3,4? Avoids I at4? Avoids D at5? And avoids positions that would repeat known errors? But we also must avoid eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,T,P.

Let's try E in position1:

Words: E + ? ? ? ? including I and D? E.g.,  E,I,D + two letters? Like E,?,I,?,D? But D not at5? If D is at4? Then pattern E ? I ? D? Or D at3? Then E ? D I ? Etc.

For example: ""ELDIN"" not common.

""EXCID"" not valid.

""EDWIN"" -> E,D,W,I,N? But N excluded? Avoid.

""EDUCe"" has 5? E,D,U,C,E? C excluded? And duplicate E? Avoid.

Not easy? So E at position3.

Then pattern ??E??, include I and D? And avoid N,A, etc.

And D not at5? So D must be at positions 1,2,4.

Also I not at4? So I can be at 1,2,5.

For letters: two of them at first two positions? Then E at3? Then two more? With I and D somewhere.

For example: if D at1, then D ? E I ? ? say ""D "" + something + E + I + ? but avoid position5 for D and position4 for I? D can be at1, I can be at position5? For example, ""D?E?I"" ... but let's think or use a word like ""DUELL"" not? ""DWELL"" -> D,W,E,L,L? Duplicate L? And no I? Not.

""MODEL"" -> M,O,D,E,L? But includes O? But no I? Not.

""QUIDE"" - not valid.

Another idea: E in position4? Then pattern ??? E? Then include I and D? With D not at5? So D must be at 1,2,3? But position4 is E? So D at 1,2,3? And I somewhere? For example, ""SEDUM"" ? S,E,D,U,M? But E at2? Which we know is wrong? Avoid? ""SEDUM"" has E at position2? Which is also invalid? So not.

"" ABIDE"" has A? Excluded? Avoid.

""GLIDE"" G,L,I,D,E? Then E at5? But avoid E at5? Because not there? So not allowed.

""OXIDE"" O,X,I,D,E? Positions: O1,X2,I3,D4,E5? Then E at5? Avoid? And position4 is D? Which is tested? Similarly E at5? Bad.

""BRIDE"" has R and B? R excluded? Avoid.

""PRIDE"" has P and R? Both excluded.

""SLIDE"" S,L,I,D,E? E at5? Avoid.

""TIMID"" T,I,M,I,D? T excluded? And duplicate I? Not.

Not successful? Let's try E at position1 again.

Perhaps ""IDIOM"" but no E? Not required? But we need to include E somehow.

Another word: ""DEVELO"" too long.

""DEVIL"" D,E,V,I,L? That's 5 letters: D,E,V,I,L? Positions: D1,E2,V3,I4,L5? But E at position2? Invalid? We know E not at2? So we cannot use E at2? In this word, E is at position2? So it's not allowed? Because we know E not at2? Therefore, we must avoid putting E in position2 in our guess.

So for ""DEVIL"", E is at2? Bad.

Similarly, ""DEVEL"" not common? And E at position2? Bad.

What if we look for words where E is at position4? And D at position1 or 2 or 3?

For example: "" "" + D + ? + E + ? but include I? And avoid D at5? Position4 is E? Then D can be at1,2 or3? And I can be at1,2,3,5? But not at4? Because position4 is E? So I cannot be at4? Which is fine? But we have to have I elsewhere.

Say D at position3? Then pattern ? ? D E ? and include I at1 or2 or5.
For example: ""ADIEU"" has A? Excluded? Avoid.
""ODIEU"" not word.

""MEDIA"" M,E,D,I,A? But A excluded? And E at position2? Bad.

""VALID"" V,A,L,I,D? A excluded? Avoid.

""SOWED"" S,O,W,E,D? But E at4? D at5? But D cannot be at5? Avoid.

So we have to avoid D at5? So for E at4, D must be at 1,2,3.

If E is at position4, then D cannot be at5? Should be at1,2,3.

How about "" "" + I + ? + E + ? and D at1,2,3? For example, ""IDE"" at beginning? ""IDEAL""? 6 letters? ""IDENT"" has T? Excluded.

""IDE"", but three letters? Need two more? ""id est"" is two words?

This is difficult? Perhaps use less common letters or accept some less common words.

Another idea: E in position3? Then let's say some examples: ""LOVED"" L,O,V,E,D? But D at5? Bad and E at4? L1,O2,V3,E4,D5? E at4? Then we can use this? Positions: E at position4? In LOVED? And D at5? But D at5 invalid? Avoid.

""MOVED"" M,O,V,E,D? Same issue? D at5.

""JADED"" J,A,D,E,D? A excluded? Duplicate D? Not.

""BIDET"" B,I,D,E,T? But T excluded? And E at4? B1,I2,D3,E4,T5? positions: I at2, D at3, E at4? D at3 is okay? But T excluded? Avoid.

""WIDES""  W,I,D,E,S? Positions: W1,I2,D3,E4,S5? Then E at4? And E is not at2? Which is good? D at3? Avoids D at5? But also includes S? And avoids eliminated letters? W at1? S at5.

But the word doesn't have a letter for position3? It does: positions 1W, 2I, 3D, 4E, 5S? So E at position4? Which hasn't been tested for position4? And D at position3? which is new? And I at position2? Which is new? And  eliminates W and S if needed.

Also, it uses E at4? D at3? I at2? and includes new letters W and S? S is common? W less.

The word ""WIDES"" is valid? Meaning wide (noun) and s? Or more commonly, ""wides"" in cricket? But we can use it? Or ""SIDEW"" not a word.

Similarly, ""HIDES"" H,I,D,E,S? Similarly, H1,I2,D3,E4,S5? Then H instead of W.

But H is a common letter? We haven't tested H yet? So perhaps ""HIDES"" or ""WIDES"".

""HIDES"": H,I,D,E,S? With H at1, I at2, D at3, E at4, S at5.

Now, feedback constraints:
- E is at position4? and we know E is not at2 or5? But it can be at4? Yes.
- D is at position3? not at5? Allowed.
- I is at position2? and we know I is not at4? Which is fine? Because we put it at2.

Also, avoids C,R,A,N,T,P? H,I,D,E,S? None of these excluded? So yes.

But we are not forced to use E at4? We could have used at1 or3? But this works? And it will give us information about the positions.

Similarly, ""QUEST"" has U,E,S,T? T excluded? Avoid.

So I think ""HIDES"" is a good guess. Or ""HIDES"" to test more common letters.

Another word: ""SHIED"" S,H,I,E,D? Positions: S1,H2,I3,E4,D5? But D is at position5? Which we know is invalid? Avoid? Cannot.

So ""HIDES"" has D at3? Avoids D at5? And E at position4? Which is a possible position? And I at2? New position? And adds H and S.

Therefore, a good option.

We might also do ""SIZED"" but Z is less common? And D at5? Bad? No, in SIZED: S1,I2,Z3,E4,D5 -> D at5? Invalid? So must avoid.

Therefore, ""HIDES"" seems usable.

Or ""MINED"" has M,I,N,E,D? N excluded? Avoid.

""LIVED"" L,I,V,E,D? But E at4? D at5? Invalid for D? Avoid.

Another possibility: ""DEBIT"" D,E,B,I,T? But T excluded? And E at2? Invalid? Avoid.

""BEING"" B,E,I,N,G? N excluded? Avoid.

So I think ""HIDES"" is appropriate: H,I,D,E,S

In ""HIDES"":
- Position1: H
- Position2: I
- Position3: D
- Position4: E
- Position5: S

With these:
- I is at2? Which is new? Not previously tested position? And we know I is in the word? But not position4? Now tested at2.
- D at3? New? Previously tested at5? Now avoid that? So okay.
- E at4? Previously at5 and2? And those were wrong? Now testing at4? Which is new.

And includes new letters H and S.

So for third guess: ""hides"" 

But is ""HIDES"" a valid English word? Yes, plural of hide? Or verb? For example, ""hides"" as in skin? Or hides from view? Yes.

So we'll go with ""hides"".Based on the feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N (not in word). E is present but not in position 5 (since marked as wrong position).
- **Guess 2: tepid** → Eliminated letters: T, P (not in word). E is present but not in position 2. I is present but not in position 4. D is present but not in position 5.

### Key Information:
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: E, I, D.
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, T, P.
- **Position constraints**:
  - E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (must be in 1, 3, or 4).
  - I cannot be in position 4 (must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5).
  - D cannot be in position 5 (must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4).
- **Remaining guesses**: 4 left (after this one).

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- Must include E, I, D to test positions and confirm the word structure.
- Avoid eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, T, P) and positions disallowed for E, I, D.
- Prioritize placing E in position 4 (an untested valid position: 1, 3, or 4). Place I and D in new positions:
  - I not in position 4 → placed in position 2 (untested).
  - D not in position 5 → placed in position 3 (untested).
- Introduce new common letters to gather more data. ""S"" and ""H"" are high-frequency letters not yet tested.
- ""HIDES"" was selected as the guess:
  - E is in position 4 (test new position).
  - I is in position 2 (test new position, since position 4 is invalid).
  - D is in position 3 (test new position, since position 5 is invalid).
  - New letters: H (position 1) and S (position 5) → high coverage.

This guess efficiently tests E, I, D placement while adding new letters, helping narrow down the word faster.

Also, since E is not in the last position (as per ""crane"" having E at the end), E might be in a different position.\n\nWe know the word has E somewhere, but not at the end (position 5). It could be at positions 1,2,3, or 4.\n\nWe need to make a new guess that does not include C, R, A, N, and must include E. Also, since E was in position 5 in ""crane"" and it\'s marked as wrong position, E is not in position 5. So E must be in one of the first four positions.\n\nWe should try to use common letters that haven\'t been tried yet. We have eliminated 4 consonants: C, R, A, N. And we know E is present.\n\nCommon vowels: We have E already, other common vowels are O, I, U. But we know A is out, so O, I, U might be candidates.\n\nCommon consonants: Some common consonants left: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.\n\nWe should try a word that has E in one of the positions 1-4, and uses other common letters not yet excluded.\n\nPossible positions for E: Let\'s try to place E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, without more information, we might spread our next guess to cover more ground.\n\nA good strategy is to pick a word that includes E and other common letters, and avoids the known absent letters (C, R, A, N).\n\nLet me think of words that have E and don\'t have C, R, A, N.\n\nExample words:\n- ""SPITE"": has S, P, I, T, E -> but E at the end, same position? We need to try E in a different position.\n- ""TIMES"": E at the end again? Same as before.\nWe want a word where E is not at the end.\n\nHow about ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E -> E at the end again? Not good.\n\nLet\'s try to have E at a different position.\n\nWords with E in position 1: ""E"", then common letters? e.g., ""EAGLE"" but A is excluded? A is not in the word, so avoid A.\n\n""EAGLE"" has A -> not allowed? We know A is absent, so we cannot use A.\n\nOther words: ""EDGES"" -> E, D, G, E, S -> but repeats E? And we don\'t know if the word allows duplicates? The rules don\'t specify, but usually words can have repeated letters? However, let\'s avoid duplicates for now to cover more letters.\n\nOptions for E at position 1:\n- ""E"" + ... without C,R,A,N: e.g., ""ELBOW"", ""EJECT"" (has C? C is excluded) -> ""EJECT"" has C and E? We know C is not in the word, so no.\n\nBetter: ""ELITE"" -> E, L, I, T, E -> but has two E\'s, and we don\'t know if the word has duplicate E\'s? Not ideal.\n\n""EXIST"" -> E, X, I, S, T -> E at position 1? But X is less common? Still, possible.\n\nBut let\'s choose a word with more common letters.\n\nPosition 2: e.g., ""H"" + E + ... -> ""HELLO"" (has L and O? but also A? wait no, ""HELLO"" has H, E, L, L, O -> duplicates? Also, not 5 distinct letters? Wait, same as above.\n\nBetter word: ""PETAL"" -> P, E, T, A, L -> but A is absent, so we can\'t use A.\n\nAvoid A.\n\nWord: ""QUERY"" -> Q is too rare? Not ideal.\n\nWord: ""STYLE"" -> S, T, Y, L, E -> E at the end? No, we need E not at the end. In STYLE, E is at the end? Position 5: STYLE: S position1, T2, Y3, L4, E5 -> same as crane? We want E in a different position.\n\nTo avoid E at the end, how about a word that doesn\'t end with E? For example, E in position 2 or 3 or 4.\n\nExamples:\n\n- Position 2: ""LEMON"" -> L, E, M, O, N -> wait, N is excluded? We know N is absent. So not.\n\n- Position 2: ""BEGIN"" -> B, E, G, I, N -> N excluded? Not.\n\n- Position 3: ""MODEM"" -> M, O, D, E, M -> duplicates? And N? No N? But duplicates.\n\n- ""TOWEL"" -> T, O, W, E, L -> E is at position 4. So that\'s good.\n\nTOWEL: T, O, W, E, L -> avoids C,R,A,N. Includes E at position 4 (so not position 5).\n\nAlternatively, ""PILED"" -> P, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4? Positions: P1, I2, L3, E4, D5 -> so E is at position 4? Yes.\n\nStill at a different position.\n\nAnother idea: use E in position 1: we haven\'t tried that. How about ""E"" at the beginning.\n\nWords: ""EQUAL"", but U is vowel? And Q might be rare? Also has U and Q.\n\n""ENSUE"" -> E, N, S, U, E -> but N is excluded? N is not allowed.\n\n""ESTER"" -> E, S, T, E, R -> has R? R is excluded? We know R is absent. So not.\n\nWe must avoid C,R,A,N. So no R.\n\nHow about ""EIGHT"" -> E, I, G, H, T -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes: E,I,G,H,T. Position: E at1, so not at5.\n\nSimilarly, ""ELBOW"" -> E, L, B, O, W -> avoids C,R,A,N.\n\n""ELBOW"": E at position1. Good.\n\nAlternatively, ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E -> E at the end? Position5: same as crane? Not good? But we need to try E at a different position? Actually, crane had E at5, and it was not correct. But with E not at5, but it might be the same for SPIKE? We haven\'t tried E at5 again? But the feedback said E is in the word but wrong position, meaning E is in the word but not at position5? Therefore, E must be in positions 1,2,3, or4.\n\nTherefore, if we use a word that has E at position5 again, we expect it to be wrong? Yes, so we shouldn\'t put E at position5 because we know it is not there.\n\nWe need to choose a word where E is at positions 1,2,3, or4.\n\nAmong the choices:\n\n""ELBOW"": E at position1 -> good? But ""ELBOW"" has E at1? Yes.\n\n""TOWEL"": T,O,W,E,L -> E at position4? Yes.\n\n""QUOTE"": Q, U, O, T, E -> E at5? No, avoid? Because we know E is not at5.\n\n""QUOTE"" ends with E? Position5? Then same? Avoid.\n\n""WHILE"": W, H, I, L, E -> E at5? Avoid.\n\n""BRIDE"": B, R, I, D, E -> has R? R is excluded. Also E at5? Bad.\n\nLet me list words without C,R,A,N and with E not in position5:\n\nOptions:\n\n- Position1: ELBOW (E,L,B,O,W) -> letters E,L,B,O,W\n\n- Position1: EIGHT (E,I,G,H,T) -> E,I,G,H,T\n\n- Position1: EMBOW (not common? better use common words)\n\nOther E-position1: EAGER? But A excluded? EAGER has A? Yes, avoid.\n\nEPOXY? E,P,O,X,Y? X and Y uncommon.\n\nLet\'s try E-position2: words with ?E???\n\nPossible words: ""GUESS"" -> G,U,E,S,S -> duplicates? And S repeated.\n\n""STEEP"" -> S,T,E,E,P -> duplicates, E repeated.\n\n""GROUP"" -> G,R,O,U P? GROUP has R? Excluded.\n\nAvoid R.\n\nWord: ""SLEPT"": S,L,E,P,T -> positions: S1, have E at position 3.\n\nAlso: ""FIELD"" -> F,I,E,L,D -> E at position 3? F1,I2,E3,L4,D5.\n\nAvoids C,R,A,N? Yes: F,I,E,L,D? A absent but F,I,L,D not excluded? We don\'t know about F,I,L,D yet.\n\nSimilarly, ""PRIDE"" has R? Excluded.\n\n""FIELD"" is F,I,E,L,D -> E at position3? Yes.\n\nAlternatively, position4: ""LOUPE"" -> L,O,U,P,E -> but E at position5? Same? Avoid? ""LOUPE"" -> spelled L-O-U-P-E, so E at5? Bad.\n\nIf the word ends with E? Position5? Then we avoid.\n\nHow about ""APPLE"" -> A and P,P? A excluded? Not.\n\n""STALE"" has A? Excluded.\n\nBetter: ""SPIEL"" -> S, P, I, E, L -> E at position4? S1,P2,I3,E4,L5 -> so E at4? Good? Avoids C,R,A,N? S,P,I,E,L -> all seem okay.\n\nBut ""SPIEL"" has E at4? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""PIXEL"" -> P, I, X, E, L -> E at position4? P1,I2,X3,E4,L5? X is less common? But valid.\n\nWe could choose:\n\nOption1: ELBOW (E1,L2,B3,O4,W5) -> tests E at position1.\n\nOption2: FIELD (F1,I2,E3,L4,D5) -> tests E at position3.\n\nOption3: SPIEL (S1,P2,I3,E4,L4 -> wait, L at5? Positions: 1=S, 2=P, 3=I, 4=E, 5=L? E at4? Good? Yes.\n\nBut SPIEL letters: S,P,I,E,L.\n\nFIELD: F,I,E,L,D.\n\nELBOW: E,L,B,O,W.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test more common letters? Or aim for high frequency?\n\nCommon English letters after eliminating C,R,A,N: Remaining common letters: E (we know), S, T, L, O, I, M, P, etc.\n\nFrequency-wise, S, T, L, O, I, M are common.\n\nSo FIELD: F and D? F is less common than S,T,O? FIELD has F,I,E,L,D? F and D are medium.\n\nSPIEL: S,P,I,E,L? S and P are common? P is fairly common.\n\nELBOW: E,L,B,O,W? B and W? Less common? B is medium, W less.\n\nPerhaps SPIEL? Or another word?\n\nHow about ""TIMES""? But E at5? Avoid.\n\n""TOWER"": T,O,W,E,R -> has R? Excluded? Avoid.\n\n""LOVES"": L,O,V,E,S -> E at4? Positions: L1,O2,V3,E4,S5? E at4? Avoids C,R,A? Includes S,V,O,L? V is less common? But avoid R.\n\n""LOVES"" -> wait, V is used? But valid.\n\nAlternatively, ""HOUSE"": H,O,U,S,E -> E at5? Bad? Avoid.\n\nOkay, let\'s choose a word that also includes T? Since T is a very common letter.\n\nWord: ""TEPID"" -> T,E,P,I,D -> positions: T1,E2,P3,I4,D5? E at2? Yes.\n\nAlso avoids C,R,A,N? Yes: T,E,P,I,D.\n\nBetter? Because E at position2? Previously E was guessed at position5, which was wrong, but now at position2? So we test E at position2? Good.\n\nSimilarly, ""PILED"": P,I,L,E,D -> E at position4? P1,I2,L3,E4,D5? But we have L? Same as others.\n\nBut TEPID starts with T? Common.\n\nTEPID: letters T,E,P,I,D.\n\nFrequency: T,E,P,I,D? All common? D is medium.\n\nAlternatively, ""STILE"": S,T,I,L,E -> E at5? Avoid? Bad.\n\nAnother word: ""BELOW"" -> B,E,L,O,W -> positions: B1,E2,L3,O4,W5? So E at position2? Avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.\n\nLetters: B,E,L,O,W? B and W? Less common? But E,L,O common.\n\nWe might choose TEPID or BELOW? Let\'s compare with possibilities.\n\nStrategy: since E must be in the word, and not in position5, possibly in positions1-4, we want to test E in a new position? Guessing E at a different position will help locate E?\n\nCurrently, we know E is not in position5? So any position from 1 to 4 is possible. We don\'t have information on which one? Therefore, putting E at position2? For example? Might be useful.\n\nI am considering ""TEPID"" because it has T, E, P, which are common? And avoids the excluded letters.\n\nAnother option is ""TILES"": T,I,L,E,S -> E at4? Positions: T1,I2,L3,E4,S5? E at4? Then S at5.\n\nBut ""TILES"" has E at4? Same as crane was E at5? We know E is wrong at position5? Not that it\'s not at5? So E can be anywhere else.\n\nYes?\n\nBut we want to test where E might be? By putting E in different position? Or use a word that has E and other common letters.\n\nWe also know that after this guess? We\'ll have more information.\n\nSo I think ""TEPID"" is a solid guess? It has T,E,P,I,D? All distinct and common? E at position2.\n\nSimilarly, ""SPITE"" has E at end? Avoid.\n\nLet me decide: ""BELOW"" and ""TEPID"" both seem good? But BELOW has W? Which is less common? TEPID has T,E,P,I,D? I\'ll go with TEPID.\n\nBut TEPID: E is at position2? And we test letter for position1=T, position2=E? Etc.\n\nAlternatively, since E can be anywhere? Another idea: use E in multiple potential positions? But no? Because word length is 5? We can only put E in one position? Unless we use a word with duplicates? But we avoid? Also, we don\'t know if E is repeated? Probably not? Assume no duplicates? We can try to avoid repeats to test more letters.\n\nTherefore, TEPID: tests letters T, E, P, I, D? All unique? And E at a new position (2) compared to crane (which was position5).\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""tepid"".\n\nBut TEPID? Is it a 5-letter word? T-E-P-I-D? Yes.\n\nAlternatively, another word? ""STEAL""? but has A? Excluded? Avoid.\n\n""POISE"" -> P,O,I,S,E -> but E at5? Avoid.\n\nSo yes?\n\nAlright, let\'s go with TEPID.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, N not in the word; E is in the word but not in position 5), the secret word must contain E in one of the first four positions and cannot contain C, R, A, or N. For the next guess:\n- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.\n- Include E, but not in position 5 to test a new position (position 2 in this case).\n- Test new common letters like T, P, I, and D.\nThe word ""tepid"" fits these criteria: E is in position 2, and it avoids the excluded letters while introducing T, P, I, and D.\n\n<guess>tepid</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tepid -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(-) P(x) I(-) D(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.\n- E is in the word but not in position 5 (where it was in ""crane"").\n\nGuess 2: tepid -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(-) P(x) I(-) D(-)\nMeaning:\n- T and P are not in the word at all.\n- E, I, D are in the word but not in their guessed positions:\n  - E is not in position 2 (where it was in ""tepid"").\n  - I is not in position 4 (where it was in ""tepid"").\n  - D is not in position 5 (where it was in ""tepid"").\n\nRecall that E is already known to be in the word and not in position 5 (from first guess). Now we also know E is not in position 2.\n\nFrom the first guess, we know the word has E and it is not in position 5. From the second guess, E is also not in position 2. Therefore, for the next guess, E must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.\n\nAdditionally, we now know that I and D are present in the word, but:\n- I is not in position 4 (from second guess).\n- D is not in position 5 (from second guess).\n\nAlso, we know that T and P are absent (since marked with x).\n\nSo far, we have eliminated the following letters: C, R, A, N, T, P.\nAnd we have confirmed present letters: E, I, D.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must contain E, I, D, and two other letters that we haven\'t tried yet.\n\nFor these other letters, we should avoid: C, R, A, N, T, P.\n\nWe also know about the positions:\n\nFor E:\n- Not position 2 (from tepid) and not position 5 (from crane), so must be at 1, 3, or 4.\n\nFor I:\n- From tepid, I was guessed at position 4 and was wrong position, so I is not in position 4.\n\nFor D:\n- From tepid, D was guessed at position 5 and was wrong position, so D is not in position 5.\n\nNow, our next step: we need to make a guess that includes E, I, D, and two other letters not eliminated. Also, we need to place E in either position 1, 3, or 4; I not in 4; D not in 5.\n\nWe should try to place these letters in positions that are still possible to gather more information.\n\nOne strategy is to put E in position 1 (since we haven\'t tested position 1 for E) and also test other common letters.\n\nBut also consider that I and D must be placed in different positions.\n\nLet\'s list possible positions for E: 1,3,4\nFor I: cannot be 4, so positions 1,2,3,5\nFor D: cannot be 5, so positions 1,2,3,4\n\nWe might also want to test other common letters: like L, O, S, U, M, etc. Avoiding C,R,A,N,T,P.\n\nWe can try a word that uses E, I, D and two new letters, say S and L?\n\nBut we need to form a valid English word.\n\nPossible word: ""FIELD"" -> but FIELD has F,I,E,L,D? However, P is excluded? Yes, FIELD avoids C,R,A,N,T,P? FIELD: F,I,E,L,D -> all letters permitted? Yes, but F and L are not tested yet? Also, remember that E is at position 3? Let\'s see:\n\nIn ""FIELD"": F(1), I(2), E(3), L(4), D(5)\nBut for E: we are placing it at position 3? Then we can verify if E is at position 3? Or if it should be elsewhere? And I at2? D at5? But from feedback, D is NOT in position 5? So if we put D at position 5? That would be invalid? Because we know D is not at position 5? Therefore, we should not put D at position 5.\n\nSo ""FIELD"" would put D at5? But we know D is not at5? So we must avoid that.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot put any known misplaced letter at the same position again? Thus, for D, we must avoid position 5? And for I, avoid position 4? And for E, avoid positions 2 and 5.\n\nTherefore, for D: place it in positions 1,2,3,4? But specifically, in the next guess, we should not put D at5? Because it\'s wrong? Similarly, not I at4.\n\nSo another word: let\'s think of a word that includes E, I, D?\n\nWith E in position1? For example: ""EDIFY"" -> E,D,I,F,Y? Positions: E1,D2,I3,F4,Y5? Then E at1? D at2? I at3? But we don\'t know about F and Y? Also, is EDIFY a common word? Maybe.\n\nBut let\'s check the positions: E at1? Then we test if E is at1? Also, D at position2? This might be premature? Since D could be elsewhere? Similarly for I at position3.\n\nBut at least we are testing E at position1? Which we haven\'t before.\n\nIf E is at1? We might get feedback? If E is at1? Then it gets ✓? Otherwise not? Same with other letters.\n\nAlternatively, we might choose a word that places E in a new position and introduces other common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""SIDE"" but that\'s 4 letters? Need 5 letters? ""SIDED""? Duplicate D? Not ideal? Better unique letters? Or not? But we haven\'t rule out duplicates? But avoid to test more letters.\n\nWord: ""DEISM"" -> D,E,I,S,M? Positions: D1,E2,I3,S4,M5? But E at position2? We know E is not at position2? From the tepid feedback? Because tepid had E at2 and it was marked as -. So E is definitely not at2? Therefore, we cannot put E at2 in ""DEISM""? Because E2 would be wrong? But we are trying to test? If we put E at2, we know it\'s not there? But that would waste a position? So better avoid positions that we know are invalid? And instead put E in positions we haven\'t ruled out? i.e., 1,3,4.\n\nTherefore, ""DEISM"" has E at2? Avoid.\n\nSimilarly, ""DETAIL"" has 6 letters? No? 6? D-E-T-A-I-L? That\'s 6? Not.\n\n""DITZY""? D,I,T,Z,Y? But T is excluded? T is at position4? T is marked absent? So we cannot use T? So avoid.\n\nAnother idea: ""JEWEL""? J,E,W,E,L -> duplicate E? And no D or I.\n\nNot including I or D? We must include E, I, D? Because they are present? To make progress.\n\nBut we need to include E? And I? And D? In the guess? Because we know they are in the word? But we are not required to? However, if we don\'t include them? We won\'t get information about their positions? Since we are limited to 6 guesses? But in Wordle? Often it\'s beneficial to use the known letters? To pin down their positions? So I think we should include all three: E, I, D? And add two new letters.\n\nSo let\'s form a word that has E, I, D? and two other letters? And places E in position 1 or 3 or 4? Avoid D at5? Avoid I at4.\n\nFor E at position1: words starting with E? Then E, then ...? Including I and D? E.g., ""EDITS"" -> E,D,I,T,S? But T is excluded? We know T is absent? So not.\n\n""EDICT""? But T again? And C excluded? C not allowed? And T excluded.\n\n""ELOID""? Not common? Not valid.\n\n""ENFIM""? No.\n\n""EQUID""? Not common? Q.\n\nNot working? How about E in position3:\n\nThen letters at pos3: E? So pattern like ..E..? Then include I and D? E.g., ""MIXED"" -> M,I,X,E,D? Is X common? Or ""SIZED""? S,I,Z,E,D? Z less common? But valid.\n\n""SIZED"": S1, I2, Z3, E4, D5? But E at position4? Then D at position5? But we know D is not at position5? From tepid? So avoid? Cannot put D at5.\n\nSimilarly, ""LINED"" -> L,I,N,E,D? But N is excluded? N not in word? From crane? So avoid.\n\n""TIMED"" -> T,I,M,E,D? But T excluded? And I at1? Position: T1,I2,M3,E4,D5? But E at4? D at5? which is invalid? And T excluded? Not.\n\nThen E at position3 and D not at5? So D must be placed in 1,2,3,4? But position3 is E? Then D elsewhere? And I somewhere? For example, position1 D? Then D first? Then E at3? Like ""D"", something, E, something? And I not at4.\n\nFor example: ""DUNES"" -> D,U,N,E,S? N excluded? Avoid.\n\n""DAMES"" -> D,A,M,E,S? A excluded? Avoid.\n\n""DOZES"" -> D,O,Z,E,S? Then S at the end? D1,O2,Z3,E4,S5? Then E at4? D at1? So pattern D? O? Z? E? S? But positions: E at position4? Then D at position1? And S at5? But D is known misplaced? But we haven\'t tested D at1? So okay? Similarly, Z is less common? But avoid D at5? Which we are not.\n\nBut also need to include I? ""DOZES"" doesn\'t have I? Not include I? But we must test I? Not necessarily? But we know I is in the word? So we should include it? To find its position? Otherwise, after the guess? We still don\'t know about I? And we have limited tries.\n\nTherefore, we need a word that includes E, I, D? And places E in 1,3,4? Avoids I at4? Avoids D at5? And avoids positions that would repeat known errors? But we also must avoid eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,T,P.\n\nLet\'s try E in position1:\n\nWords: E + ? ? ? ? including I and D? E.g.,  E,I,D + two letters? Like E,?,I,?,D? But D not at5? If D is at4? Then pattern E ? I ? D? Or D at3? Then E ? D I ? Etc.\n\nFor example: ""ELDIN"" not common.\n\n""EXCID"" not valid.\n\n""EDWIN"" -> E,D,W,I,N? But N excluded? Avoid.\n\n""EDUCe"" has 5? E,D,U,C,E? C excluded? And duplicate E? Avoid.\n\nNot easy? So E at position3.\n\nThen pattern ??E??, include I and D? And avoid N,A, etc.\n\nAnd D not at5? So D must be at positions 1,2,4.\n\nAlso I not at4? So I can be at 1,2,5.\n\nFor letters: two of them at first two positions? Then E at3? Then two more? With I and D somewhere.\n\nFor example: if D at1, then D ? E I ? ? say ""D "" + something + E + I + ? but avoid position5 for D and position4 for I? D can be at1, I can be at position5? For example, ""D?E?I"" ... but let\'s think or use a word like ""DUELL"" not? ""DWELL"" -> D,W,E,L,L? Duplicate L? And no I? Not.\n\n""MODEL"" -> M,O,D,E,L? But includes O? But no I? Not.\n\n""QUIDE"" - not valid.\n\nAnother idea: E in position4? Then pattern ??? E? Then include I and D? With D not at5? So D must be at 1,2,3? But position4 is E? So D at 1,2,3? And I somewhere? For example, ""SEDUM"" ? S,E,D,U,M? But E at2? Which we know is wrong? Avoid? ""SEDUM"" has E at position2? Which is also invalid? So not.\n\n"" ABIDE"" has A? Excluded? Avoid.\n\n""GLIDE"" G,L,I,D,E? Then E at5? But avoid E at5? Because not there? So not allowed.\n\n""OXIDE"" O,X,I,D,E? Positions: O1,X2,I3,D4,E5? Then E at5? Avoid? And position4 is D? Which is tested? Similarly E at5? Bad.\n\n""BRIDE"" has R and B? R excluded? Avoid.\n\n""PRIDE"" has P and R? Both excluded.\n\n""SLIDE"" S,L,I,D,E? E at5? Avoid.\n\n""TIMID"" T,I,M,I,D? T excluded? And duplicate I? Not.\n\nNot successful? Let\'s try E at position1 again.\n\nPerhaps ""IDIOM"" but no E? Not required? But we need to include E somehow.\n\nAnother word: ""DEVELO"" too long.\n\n""DEVIL"" D,E,V,I,L? That\'s 5 letters: D,E,V,I,L? Positions: D1,E2,V3,I4,L5? But E at position2? Invalid? We know E not at2? So we cannot use E at2? In this word, E is at position2? So it\'s not allowed? Because we know E not at2? Therefore, we must avoid putting E in position2 in our guess.\n\nSo for ""DEVIL"", E is at2? Bad.\n\nSimilarly, ""DEVEL"" not common? And E at position2? Bad.\n\nWhat if we look for words where E is at position4? And D at position1 or 2 or 3?\n\nFor example: "" "" + D + ? + E + ? but include I? And avoid D at5? Position4 is E? Then D can be at1,2 or3? And I can be at1,2,3,5? But not at4? Because position4 is E? So I cannot be at4? Which is fine? But we have to have I elsewhere.\n\nSay D at position3? Then pattern ? ? D E ? and include I at1 or2 or5.\nFor example: ""ADIEU"" has A? Excluded? Avoid.\n""ODIEU"" not word.\n\n""MEDIA"" M,E,D,I,A? But A excluded? And E at position2? Bad.\n\n""VALID"" V,A,L,I,D? A excluded? Avoid.\n\n""SOWED"" S,O,W,E,D? But E at4? D at5? But D cannot be at5? Avoid.\n\nSo we have to avoid D at5? So for E at4, D must be at 1,2,3.\n\nIf E is at position4, then D cannot be at5? Should be at1,2,3.\n\nHow about "" "" + I + ? + E + ? and D at1,2,3? For example, ""IDE"" at beginning? ""IDEAL""? 6 letters? ""IDENT"" has T? Excluded.\n\n""IDE"", but three letters? Need two more? ""id est"" is two words?\n\nThis is difficult? Perhaps use less common letters or accept some less common words.\n\nAnother idea: E in position3? Then let\'s say some examples: ""LOVED"" L,O,V,E,D? But D at5? Bad and E at4? L1,O2,V3,E4,D5? E at4? Then we can use this? Positions: E at position4? In LOVED? And D at5? But D at5 invalid? Avoid.\n\n""MOVED"" M,O,V,E,D? Same issue? D at5.\n\n""JADED"" J,A,D,E,D? A excluded? Duplicate D? Not.\n\n""BIDET"" B,I,D,E,T? But T excluded? And E at4? B1,I2,D3,E4,T5? positions: I at2, D at3, E at4? D at3 is okay? But T excluded? Avoid.\n\n""WIDES""  W,I,D,E,S? Positions: W1,I2,D3,E4,S5? Then E at4? And E is not at2? Which is good? D at3? Avoids D at5? But also includes S? And avoids eliminated letters? W at1? S at5.\n\nBut the word doesn\'t have a letter for position3? It does: positions 1W, 2I, 3D, 4E, 5S? So E at position4? Which hasn\'t been tested for position4? And D at position3? which is new? And I at position2? Which is new? And  eliminates W and S if needed.\n\nAlso, it uses E at4? D at3? I at2? and includes new letters W and S? S is common? W less.\n\nThe word ""WIDES"" is valid? Meaning wide (noun) and s? Or more commonly, ""wides"" in cricket? But we can use it? Or ""SIDEW"" not a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""HIDES"" H,I,D,E,S? Similarly, H1,I2,D3,E4,S5? Then H instead of W.\n\nBut H is a common letter? We haven\'t tested H yet? So perhaps ""HIDES"" or ""WIDES"".\n\n""HIDES"": H,I,D,E,S? With H at1, I at2, D at3, E at4, S at5.\n\nNow, feedback constraints:\n- E is at position4? and we know E is not at2 or5? But it can be at4? Yes.\n- D is at position3? not at5? Allowed.\n- I is at position2? and we know I is not at4? Which is fine? Because we put it at2.\n\nAlso, avoids C,R,A,N,T,P? H,I,D,E,S? None of these excluded? So yes.\n\nBut we are not forced to use E at4? We could have used at1 or3? But this works? And it will give us information about the positions.\n\nSimilarly, ""QUEST"" has U,E,S,T? T excluded? Avoid.\n\nSo I think ""HIDES"" is a good guess. Or ""HIDES"" to test more common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""SHIED"" S,H,I,E,D? Positions: S1,H2,I3,E4,D5? But D is at position5? Which we know is invalid? Avoid? Cannot.\n\nSo ""HIDES"" has D at3? Avoids D at5? And E at position4? Which is a possible position? And I at2? New position? And adds H and S.\n\nTherefore, a good option.\n\nWe might also do ""SIZED"" but Z is less common? And D at5? Bad? No, in SIZED: S1,I2,Z3,E4,D5 -> D at5? Invalid? So must avoid.\n\nTherefore, ""HIDES"" seems usable.\n\nOr ""MINED"" has M,I,N,E,D? N excluded? Avoid.\n\n""LIVED"" L,I,V,E,D? But E at4? D at5? Invalid for D? Avoid.\n\nAnother possibility: ""DEBIT"" D,E,B,I,T? But T excluded? And E at2? Invalid? Avoid.\n\n""BEING"" B,E,I,N,G? N excluded? Avoid.\n\nSo I think ""HIDES"" is appropriate: H,I,D,E,S\n\nIn ""HIDES"":\n- Position1: H\n- Position2: I\n- Position3: D\n- Position4: E\n- Position5: S\n\nWith these:\n- I is at2? Which is new? Not previously tested position? And we know I is in the word? But not position4? Now tested at2.\n- D at3? New? Previously tested at5? Now avoid that? So okay.\n- E at4? Previously at5 and2? And those were wrong? Now testing at4? Which is new.\n\nAnd includes new letters H and S.\n\nSo for third guess: ""hides"" \n\nBut is ""HIDES"" a valid English word? Yes, plural of hide? Or verb? For example, ""hides"" as in skin? Or hides from view? Yes.\n\nSo we\'ll go with ""hides"".Based on the feedback:\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N (not in word). E is present but not in position 5 (since marked as wrong position).\n- **Guess 2: tepid** → Eliminated letters: T, P (not in word). E is present but not in position 2. I is present but not in position 4. D is present but not in position 5.\n\n### Key Information:\n- **Confirmed letters in the word**: E, I, D.\n- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, T, P.\n- **Position constraints**:\n  - E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (must be in 1, 3, or 4).\n  - I cannot be in position 4 (must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5).\n  - D cannot be in position 5 (must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4).\n- **Remaining guesses**: 4 left (after this one).\n\n### Strategy for Third Guess:\n- Must include E, I, D to test positions and confirm the word structure.\n- Avoid eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, T, P) and positions disallowed for E, I, D.\n- Prioritize placing E in position 4 (an untested valid position: 1, 3, or 4). Place I and D in new positions:\n  - I not in position 4 → placed in position 2 (untested).\n  - D not in position 5 → placed in position 3 (untested).\n- Introduce new common letters to gather more data. ""S"" and ""H"" are high-frequency letters not yet tested.\n- ""HIDES"" was selected as the guess:\n  - E is in position 4 (test new position).\n  - I is in position 2 (test new position, since position 4 is invalid).\n  - D is in position 3 (test new position, since position 5 is invalid).\n  - New letters: H (position 1) and S (position 5) → high coverage.\n\nThis guess efficiently tests E, I, D placement while adding new letters, helping narrow down the word faster.\n\n<guess>hides</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tepid -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(-) P(x) I(-) D(-)\nGuess 3: hides -> FEEDBACK: H(x) I(-) D(-) E(-) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for three guesses:

1. **crane**: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   - Meaning: C, R, A, N are absent. E is present but not in position 5.

2. **tepid**: T(x) E(-) P(x) I(-) D(-)
   - Meaning: T and P are absent. E is present but not in position 2. I is present but not in position 4. D is present but not in position 5.

3. **hides**: H(x) I(-) D(-) E(-) S(x)
   - Meaning: H and S are absent. I is present but not in position 2 (where it was guessed). D is present but not in position 3 (where it was guessed). E is present but not in position 4 (where it was guessed).

Now, consolidate the information:

- **Absent letters (definitely not in the word)**: C, R, A, N, T, P, H, S.
- **Present letters**: E, I, D (each confirmed at least once, but with wrong positions).

Position constraints:

- **E**:
  - Not in position 2 (from tepid), not in position 5 (from crane), and not in position 4 (from hides). 
  - Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 3 (the only positions left: 1 and 3).

- **I**:
  - Not in position 4 (from tepid), not in position 2 (from hides). 
  - Therefore, I must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (since positions 2 and 4 are excluded).

- **D**:
  - Not in position 5 (from tepid), not in position 3 (from hides).
  - Therefore, D must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (any position except 3 and 5).

But note: E and I might both be in positions 1 or 3? But a letter can only occupy one position. So we have to assign distinct positions for E, I, D.

Given that E must be in 1 or 3, and I must be in 1, 3, or 5, but cannot share the same position, so:

Possible cases:

- If E is in position 1:
  - Then I cannot be in position 1? So I must be in position 3 or 5? But position 3: E is already at1? Then position3 is free? But I can be at3.
  - And D in positions 2 or 4? Because not 1 (if E is there), not 3 (if I is? but not necessarily), and not 5 (excluded).

- If E is in position 3:
  - Then I cannot be in position 3? So I must be in position 1 or 5.
  - And D in positions 1, 2, or 4? But position1: if I is there? Then not D? Etc.

But we need to form a word with E, I, D and two other letters. We know the word has E, I, D and two unknown letters? We don't know yet.

Also, we have eliminated many common letters: C,R,A,N,T,P,H,S. So remaining letters: let's list possible letters.

Alphabet minus eliminated: a b d e f g i j k l m o q u v w x y z

But we know E,I,D are present? So the other two letters must be from: B, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, for the next guess, we have to include E, I, D? And place them in valid positions? And use new letters to test? Also avoid using eliminated letters? So no H,S, etc.

We also know positions: 

- E: must be 1 or 3? Since not 2,4,5.
- I: must be 1,3,5? But not 2 or 4.
- D: must be 1,2,4? But not 3 or 5.

But position overlap? For example, position 1: could be E or I? But not both? Similarly position3: E or I? Etc.

We need to assign:

Case 1: E in position 1.
Then:
- Position1: E?
- Then I: cannot be position1? So I must be in position3 or5?
- D: must be in position2 or4? Because position1 taken? Position3 might be taken by I? So if I is at3? Then D at2 or4? Also position5: if I is at5? Then D at2 or4.

Case 2: E in position3.
Then:
- Position3: E?
- I: cannot be at3? So I must be at1 or5?
- D: at1,2,4? But position3 taken? So D: at1,2,4.

Now, we must also include two more letters? And form a valid English word.

Let's think of words with E, I, D? Try Case 1: E in position1? So E _ ? _ ? 

First subcase: E at1, I at3? Then pattern E ? I ? ? 

Then D must be at2 or4? So E D I ? ? or E ? I D ? 

But also need another letter? For example E D I ? ? -> must fill positions 4 and 5? But D is in position 3? No, in this: position1:E, position2: if D? position3:I? Then position4: something? Position5: something? 

But in pattern, position1:E, position2:?, position3:I, position4:?, position5:?

If D is at position2? Then E D I ? ??

But that would require D at position2? Which is allowed? Since D constraint: can be at position2? But we haven't tested D at position2? So okay? Or D at position4? Then E ? I D ? 

Similarly, if I is at position5? Then for E at1 and I at5? Pattern E ? ? ? I? Then D must be at position2 or4? So E D ? ? I or E ? ? D I?

We need to find valid words.

First: pattern E ? I ? ? with D at position2? So E D I ? ? -> need two letters? e.g., ""EDIFY""? But E at1? D at2? I at3? Then F and Y? ""edify"" is E D I F Y? Positions match? E1,D2,I3,F4,Y5? Also avoids eliminated letters? F and Y not eliminated? So possible.

But we haven't tested F and Y? And we have to test? So okay.

In this pattern: E1, D2, I3? But for I: we are putting I at position3? Which hasn't been tested? Previously, I was guessed at position4 (tepid) and position2 (hides)? Both wrong? But not position3? So we test position3? Similarly, D at position2? Previously guessed at position5 (tepid) and position3 (hides)? Both wrong? Now testing position2? And E at1? Previously guessed E at positions5?2?4? Now testing position1? Which we haven't tested? So could be correct? Or not.

Similarly, other possibility: pattern E ? I D ? ? So E ? I D ? -> like E L I D ? ... ""ELIDE""? E,L,I,D,E? Duplicate E? Not good? Or ""ELUDE"" has U,D? but D at5? But we have D at position4? ""ELIDE"" is E L I D E? But duplicate E? Not? Or valid? But E at1? L at2? I at3? D at4? E at5? Duplicate E? But the secret word might not have duplicate? We don't know? But in constraints, if E is only one? Then we can't? Or we can? But better use distinct letters to test more? So perhaps avoid duplicates? Since we haven't had indication of duplicates.

So ""EDIFY"" might be better? E D I F Y? Unique letters.

Now Case 2: E at position3? Then pattern ? ? E ? ? 

I must be at1 or5? 

Subcase: I at1? Then I ? E ? ?

D must be at2 or4? Because position1 taken by I? Position3 taken by E? So D at2 or4? Pattern I D E ? ?  or I ? E D ?

Again, words: ""IDLE"" plus a letter? No, 4 letters? ""IDLED""? Duplicate D? ""IDLER"" has R? Excluded? Avoid.

""IDLES"" has S? Excluded? Avoid.

""IDEAL""? 5? I D E A L? But A excluded? Avoid.

""I ? E D ? "": For example ""LIBED"" not common? ""MINED"" has N? Avoid? Not working.

Subcase: I at5? Then pattern ? ? E ? I? D at1,2,4? 

So ? ? E ? I? With D? Say D ? E ? I? but two positions? Or pattern "" D ? E ? I "" ? which is 5 characters? So need position1: D? position2: something? position3: E? position4: something? position5: I? 

Then D at1? E at3? I at5? Then pattern D ? E ? I? Words: ""DUELL"" not? ""DWELL"" -> D,W,E,L,L? But L repeated? And no I at5? Pattern has I at5? So D W E ? I? Then L at4? DWELL? But L repeated? Not distinct? Or ""DOVIE"" D,O,V,I,E? But E at5? And pattern has E at3? I at5? So not? ""DOXIE"" D,O,X,I,E? Then E at5? Pattern must have E at position3? If E is at3? Then word must be D ? E ? I? So fourth letter? Second and fourth need letters? For example: ""DUVET"" D,U,V,E,T? But T excluded? And E at4? Not at3? Bad.

""DAZED"" D,A,Z,E,D? A excluded? Avoid.

Perhaps be less strict? But we need to use valid positions.

Another word: if E at3? I at1? Pattern I ? E ? ? with D at2? Then I D E ? ? -> need two letters? Like ""ID E"" with two more? ""IDESI"" not? Or ""IDE ""? Not.

Perhaps not many common words? So Case 1 seems more promising? With E at1? I at3? D at2? Giving ""EDIFY"".

But ""EDIFY"" might be acceptable? But let's see if there are other options.

Alternatively, from Case 1: E at1? I at5? Then pattern E ? ? ? I? D at position2 or4? 

If D at2? Pattern E D ? ? I? Words: ""ED "" + ? ""EDUCI"" not? Or ""ED F I"" ... not English? ""EDIUM"" not? Uncommon? Or ""ED V I"" ? ""edwin"" but N? Avoid.

If D at4? Pattern E ? ? D I? Words? ""ELUDI"" E L U D I? Positions: E1,L2,U3,D4,I5? Then L and U not excluded? So possible? ""ELUDI"" is not common? Or ""elude"" with E already? ""elude"" is 4? ""eluted"" longer? ""EXUDI"" E,X,U,D,I? X,U? Possible? ""EXUDI"" not a word? Or ""EXUDE"" but without I? We need I at position5? So E X U D I -> ""exudi"" not? Not valid English word.

So back to ""EDIFY""? Which seems reasonable? Or try to put E at position1? I at position3? D not at2? But D can be at position4? Then pattern E ? I D ? with any letter at position2?

So E ? I D ? ? For example, ""E L I D E"" duplicate? ""E V I D E""? But positions: E1,V2,I3,D4,E5? Duplicate E? Avoid? ""VALID"" has A? Excluded? ""SOLID"" has S? Excluded? Avoid? ""FLUID"" F,L,U,I,D? Then positions: F1,L2,U3,I4,D5? But I at position4? We know I cannot be at position4? From tepid? So avoid putting I at4? So cannot use such word.

Therefore, the only feasible pattern so far is E at1, D at2, I at3? Or with I at5? But E at1 and I at5? With D at2 or4? But I didn't find a good word? So perhaps ""EDIFY"" for E1, D2, I3? And F4? Y5.

Another common word? ""MEDIA"" excluded? Etc.

Other possibility: we haven't tried placing E at position3 only. Let me think.

Another pattern: E at position3, I at position5? Pattern ? ? E ? I? D at position4? Then ? ? E D I? Words: ""B E D I"" not? Need 5 letters? ""OREDI"" not? ""UREDI"" not? ""COZED"" T? Excluded? Not.

"" "" + Q + E + D + I? ""QUEDI"" not? Not.

Perhaps ""OILED"" O,I,L,E,D? But E at position4? And E at position3? Pattern requires E at3? Not? And I at position1? O at1? If I at1? Then pattern for E at3: ? ? E ? ? with I at position5? So ? ? E ? I? And D at position4? ? ? E D I? So three letters at beginning? Then E? Then D? Then I? But ? ? E D I? That's 4? Need 5? Positions: 1,2,3(E),4(D),5(I)? Then we need letters for position1 and2? And D at4? Position3:E, position4:D, position5:I? So word like X Y E D I? Words: ""DYED"" not? ""KEYED"" K,E,Y,E,D? Duplicate E? Avoid? ""EYEDI"" not? Not common words.

So the best option is to go with ""EDIFY"": E D I F Y? With positions: E at1, D at2, I at3? Which are all new positions? And tests the case for E at position1? And also introduces F and Y? Unused letters.

Moreover, it uses only non-eliminated letters? So farF and Y? Are they  in the list? Yes.

Also, the feedback will tell us:
- If E is at position1? Then ✓? Otherwise, if not? Then E must be at position3? Since only two possibilities? Similarly, for I and D? But we are putting them in new positions? So likely useful.

Thus, fourth guess: ""EDIFY""

But is ""EDIFY"" a valid word? Yes? Verb? Meaning to instruct or improve morally.

So we'll use that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- Letters **C, R, A, N, T, P, H, S** are absent and cannot be in the word.
- Letters **E, I, D** are confirmed to be in the word, with position constraints:
  - **E** cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (must be in 1 or 3).
  - **I** cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (must be in 1, 3, or 5).
  - **D** cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (must be in 1, 2, or 4).
- Only 3 guesses remain, so the next word must strategically place E, I, D in untested positions while introducing new letters.

After considering possible positions:
- E cannot be in 2/4/5, so it must be in position 1 or 3.
- Placing E in position 1 allows I to be in 3 or 5 and D in 2 or 4.
- The word ""edify"" fits:
  - E at position 1 (tests if E is in position 1).
  - D at position 2 (new position for D, not yet tested).
  - I at position 3 (new position for I, not yet tested).
- It avoids all eliminated letters and introduces new common letters (F and Y) for testing.

<guess>edify</guess>",edify,"We are given feedback for three guesses:

1. **crane**: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   - Meaning: C, R, A, N are absent. E is present but not in position 5.

2. **tepid**: T(x) E(-) P(x) I(-) D(-)
   - Meaning: T and P are absent. E is present but not in position 2. I is present but not in position 4. D is present but not in position 5.

3. **hides**: H(x) I(-) D(-) E(-) S(x)
   - Meaning: H and S are absent. I is present but not in position 2 (where it was guessed). D is present but not in position 3 (where it was guessed). E is present but not in position 4 (where it was guessed).

Now, consolidate the information:

- **Absent letters (definitely not in the word)**: C, R, A, N, T, P, H, S.
- **Present letters**: E, I, D (each confirmed at least once, but with wrong positions).

Position constraints:

- **E**:
  - Not in position 2 (from tepid), not in position 5 (from crane), and not in position 4 (from hides). 
  - Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 3 (the only positions left: 1 and 3).

- **I**:
  - Not in position 4 (from tepid), not in position 2 (from hides). 
  - Therefore, I must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (since positions 2 and 4 are excluded).

- **D**:
  - Not in position 5 (from tepid), not in position 3 (from hides).
  - Therefore, D must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (any position except 3 and 5).

But note: E and I might both be in positions 1 or 3? But a letter can only occupy one position. So we have to assign distinct positions for E, I, D.

Given that E must be in 1 or 3, and I must be in 1, 3, or 5, but cannot share the same position, so:

Possible cases:

- If E is in position 1:
  - Then I cannot be in position 1? So I must be in position 3 or 5? But position 3: E is already at1? Then position3 is free? But I can be at3.
  - And D in positions 2 or 4? Because not 1 (if E is there), not 3 (if I is? but not necessarily), and not 5 (excluded).

- If E is in position 3:
  - Then I cannot be in position 3? So I must be in position 1 or 5.
  - And D in positions 1, 2, or 4? But position1: if I is there? Then not D? Etc.

But we need to form a word with E, I, D and two other letters. We know the word has E, I, D and two unknown letters? We don't know yet.

Also, we have eliminated many common letters: C,R,A,N,T,P,H,S. So remaining letters: let's list possible letters.

Alphabet minus eliminated: a b d e f g i j k l m o q u v w x y z

But we know E,I,D are present? So the other two letters must be from: B, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, for the next guess, we have to include E, I, D? And place them in valid positions? And use new letters to test? Also avoid using eliminated letters? So no H,S, etc.

We also know positions: 

- E: must be 1 or 3? Since not 2,4,5.
- I: must be 1,3,5? But not 2 or 4.
- D: must be 1,2,4? But not 3 or 5.

But position overlap? For example, position 1: could be E or I? But not both? Similarly position3: E or I? Etc.

We need to assign:

Case 1: E in position 1.
Then:
- Position1: E?
- Then I: cannot be position1? So I must be in position3 or5?
- D: must be in position2 or4? Because position1 taken? Position3 might be taken by I? So if I is at3? Then D at2 or4? Also position5: if I is at5? Then D at2 or4.

Case 2: E in position3.
Then:
- Position3: E?
- I: cannot be at3? So I must be at1 or5?
- D: at1,2,4? But position3 taken? So D: at1,2,4.

Now, we must also include two more letters? And form a valid English word.

Let's think of words with E, I, D? Try Case 1: E in position1? So E _ ? _ ? 

First subcase: E at1, I at3? Then pattern E ? I ? ? 

Then D must be at2 or4? So E D I ? ? or E ? I D ? 

But also need another letter? For example E D I ? ? -> must fill positions 4 and 5? But D is in position 3? No, in this: position1:E, position2: if D? position3:I? Then position4: something? Position5: something? 

But in pattern, position1:E, position2:?, position3:I, position4:?, position5:?

If D is at position2? Then E D I ? ??

But that would require D at position2? Which is allowed? Since D constraint: can be at position2? But we haven't tested D at position2? So okay? Or D at position4? Then E ? I D ? 

Similarly, if I is at position5? Then for E at1 and I at5? Pattern E ? ? ? I? Then D must be at position2 or4? So E D ? ? I or E ? ? D I?

We need to find valid words.

First: pattern E ? I ? ? with D at position2? So E D I ? ? -> need two letters? e.g., ""EDIFY""? But E at1? D at2? I at3? Then F and Y? ""edify"" is E D I F Y? Positions match? E1,D2,I3,F4,Y5? Also avoids eliminated letters? F and Y not eliminated? So possible.

But we haven't tested F and Y? And we have to test? So okay.

In this pattern: E1, D2, I3? But for I: we are putting I at position3? Which hasn't been tested? Previously, I was guessed at position4 (tepid) and position2 (hides)? Both wrong? But not position3? So we test position3? Similarly, D at position2? Previously guessed at position5 (tepid) and position3 (hides)? Both wrong? Now testing position2? And E at1? Previously guessed E at positions5?2?4? Now testing position1? Which we haven't tested? So could be correct? Or not.

Similarly, other possibility: pattern E ? I D ? ? So E ? I D ? -> like E L I D ? ... ""ELIDE""? E,L,I,D,E? Duplicate E? Not good? Or ""ELUDE"" has U,D? but D at5? But we have D at position4? ""ELIDE"" is E L I D E? But duplicate E? Not? Or valid? But E at1? L at2? I at3? D at4? E at5? Duplicate E? But the secret word might not have duplicate? We don't know? But in constraints, if E is only one? Then we can't? Or we can? But better use distinct letters to test more? So perhaps avoid duplicates? Since we haven't had indication of duplicates.

So ""EDIFY"" might be better? E D I F Y? Unique letters.

Now Case 2: E at position3? Then pattern ? ? E ? ? 

I must be at1 or5? 

Subcase: I at1? Then I ? E ? ?

D must be at2 or4? Because position1 taken by I? Position3 taken by E? So D at2 or4? Pattern I D E ? ?  or I ? E D ?

Again, words: ""IDLE"" plus a letter? No, 4 letters? ""IDLED""? Duplicate D? ""IDLER"" has R? Excluded? Avoid.

""IDLES"" has S? Excluded? Avoid.

""IDEAL""? 5? I D E A L? But A excluded? Avoid.

""I ? E D ? "": For example ""LIBED"" not common? ""MINED"" has N? Avoid? Not working.

Subcase: I at5? Then pattern ? ? E ? I? D at1,2,4? 

So ? ? E ? I? With D? Say D ? E ? I? but two positions? Or pattern "" D ? E ? I "" ? which is 5 characters? So need position1: D? position2: something? position3: E? position4: something? position5: I? 

Then D at1? E at3? I at5? Then pattern D ? E ? I? Words: ""DUELL"" not? ""DWELL"" -> D,W,E,L,L? But L repeated? And no I at5? Pattern has I at5? So D W E ? I? Then L at4? DWELL? But L repeated? Not distinct? Or ""DOVIE"" D,O,V,I,E? But E at5? And pattern has E at3? I at5? So not? ""DOXIE"" D,O,X,I,E? Then E at5? Pattern must have E at position3? If E is at3? Then word must be D ? E ? I? So fourth letter? Second and fourth need letters? For example: ""DUVET"" D,U,V,E,T? But T excluded? And E at4? Not at3? Bad.

""DAZED"" D,A,Z,E,D? A excluded? Avoid.

Perhaps be less strict? But we need to use valid positions.

Another word: if E at3? I at1? Pattern I ? E ? ? with D at2? Then I D E ? ? -> need two letters? Like ""ID E"" with two more? ""IDESI"" not? Or ""IDE ""? Not.

Perhaps not many common words? So Case 1 seems more promising? With E at1? I at3? D at2? Giving ""EDIFY"".

But ""EDIFY"" might be acceptable? But let's see if there are other options.

Alternatively, from Case 1: E at1? I at5? Then pattern E ? ? ? I? D at position2 or4? 

If D at2? Pattern E D ? ? I? Words: ""ED "" + ? ""EDUCI"" not? Or ""ED F I"" ... not English? ""EDIUM"" not? Uncommon? Or ""ED V I"" ? ""edwin"" but N? Avoid.

If D at4? Pattern E ? ? D I? Words? ""ELUDI"" E L U D I? Positions: E1,L2,U3,D4,I5? Then L and U not excluded? So possible? ""ELUDI"" is not common? Or ""elude"" with E already? ""elude"" is 4? ""eluted"" longer? ""EXUDI"" E,X,U,D,I? X,U? Possible? ""EXUDI"" not a word? Or ""EXUDE"" but without I? We need I at position5? So E X U D I -> ""exudi"" not? Not valid English word.

So back to ""EDIFY""? Which seems reasonable? Or try to put E at position1? I at position3? D not at2? But D can be at position4? Then pattern E ? I D ? with any letter at position2?

So E ? I D ? ? For example, ""E L I D E"" duplicate? ""E V I D E""? But positions: E1,V2,I3,D4,E5? Duplicate E? Avoid? ""VALID"" has A? Excluded? ""SOLID"" has S? Excluded? Avoid? ""FLUID"" F,L,U,I,D? Then positions: F1,L2,U3,I4,D5? But I at position4? We know I cannot be at position4? From tepid? So avoid putting I at4? So cannot use such word.

Therefore, the only feasible pattern so far is E at1, D at2, I at3? Or with I at5? But E at1 and I at5? With D at2 or4? But I didn't find a good word? So perhaps ""EDIFY"" for E1, D2, I3? And F4? Y5.

Another common word? ""MEDIA"" excluded? Etc.

Other possibility: we haven't tried placing E at position3 only. Let me think.

Another pattern: E at position3, I at position5? Pattern ? ? E ? I? D at position4? Then ? ? E D I? Words: ""B E D I"" not? Need 5 letters? ""OREDI"" not? ""UREDI"" not? ""COZED"" T? Excluded? Not.

"" "" + Q + E + D + I? ""QUEDI"" not? Not.

Perhaps ""OILED"" O,I,L,E,D? But E at position4? And E at position3? Pattern requires E at3? Not? And I at position1? O at1? If I at1? Then pattern for E at3: ? ? E ? ? with I at position5? So ? ? E ? I? And D at position4? ? ? E D I? So three letters at beginning? Then E? Then D? Then I? But ? ? E D I? That's 4? Need 5? Positions: 1,2,3(E),4(D),5(I)? Then we need letters for position1 and2? And D at4? Position3:E, position4:D, position5:I? So word like X Y E D I? Words: ""DYED"" not? ""KEYED"" K,E,Y,E,D? Duplicate E? Avoid? ""EYEDI"" not? Not common words.

So the best option is to go with ""EDIFY"": E D I F Y? With positions: E at1, D at2, I at3? Which are all new positions? And tests the case for E at position1? And also introduces F and Y? Unused letters.

Moreover, it uses only non-eliminated letters? So farF and Y? Are they  in the list? Yes.

Also, the feedback will tell us:
- If E is at position1? Then ✓? Otherwise, if not? Then E must be at position3? Since only two possibilities? Similarly, for I and D? But we are putting them in new positions? So likely useful.

Thus, fourth guess: ""EDIFY""

But is ""EDIFY"" a valid word? Yes? Verb? Meaning to instruct or improve morally.

So we'll use that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
