We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but wrong position)

So, from the feedback:
- The secret word has C in the first position (because ✓).
- The secret word contains R, A, and E, but not in the positions guessed (positions 2, 3, and 5 respectively).
- The letter N is not in the secret word at all.

We know:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: Cannot be R (because R is in the word but not here), and cannot be N (excluded).
- Position 3: Cannot be A, and cannot be N.
- Position 4: Cannot be N? Actually, N is entirely absent, so no position can have N.
- Position 5: Cannot be E, but E is present elsewhere.

Also, R, A, E must appear in the word, but in positions other than 2, 3, and 5 respectively.

So the word we are looking for:
- Starts with C.
- Contains R, A, E (and C we already have at position 1).
- Does not contain N.

Moreover, since R, A, E are not in positions 2, 3, 5, but must appear somewhere else.

Possible positions for R, A, E:
- R: cannot be in position 2, so it must be in position 3, 4, or ?
  Actually, positions we have: 1,2,3,4,5.
  Position 1 is C (fixed), so R must be in 3,4? Or ... wait, we have position 1 taken by C, so R can be in 3,4, or possibly 5? But position 5 was E in the guess, but E is in the word and not in position 5, so R could be in position 5? Yes.

Similarly for A: it was in position 3 in the guess, so cannot be in position 3. So it can be in position 2,4,5? But position 1 is C, so not available.

Similarly for E: it was in position 5 in the guess, so cannot be in position 5. So it can be in position 2,3,4.

Now, note that we have exactly 5 letters: C, R, A, E, and one more? Because we know four letters: C, R, A, E are in, but the word has 5 letters. So there is one more letter.

We also know N is out.

So the word must be: C ? ? ? ? 
with letters including R, A, E and one more letter.

We need to form a word that starts with C, and contains R, A, E.

We also know the positions that are disallowed for some letters.

Let me think of words that start with C and have R, A, E.

For example: ""CRATE"", ""CRANE"" but we tried crane and N is out, so no. ""CRATE"" has T instead of N.

But let's check the positions:

In ""CRATE"":
- C is position 1 -> correct.
- R is position 2 -> but feedback said R is not in position 2? Yes, because R got a '-', meaning it's not in position 2. So if we guess ""CRATE"", R would be in position 2, which is forbidden.

Therefore, ""CRATE"" is invalid because R should not be in position 2.

Other words: ""CARTE""? But E is at position 5? But feedback says E cannot be in position 5? Actually, in feedback E got '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 5. So if we put E at position 5, that would be wrong.

In ""CARTE"":
- Position 1: C (good)
- Position 2: A -> but originally A was in position 3 and got '-', so it must not be in position 3? But position 2 might be okay? We don't know yet.

We have to avoid:
- R in position 2 (from feedback)
- A in position 3 (from feedback)
- E in position 5 (from feedback)

So in our next guess, we should avoid these positions for those letters.

Moreover, we have one more letter to find.

Let me list possible words: ""C"" words that contain R, A, E.

Possible: ""CAUSE"", but that has U and S? And does not have R? We must have R.

We know the word must contain R, A, E (and C).

So letters: C, R, A, E, and one unknown.

We also know N is not in the word.

Looking for words: 
- Starting with C
- Having R, A, E

For example: ""CRANE"" we tried -> ruled out by N and feedback.
""CRATE"" -> R at position 2, which is bad (R is not at position 2).

""CARVE"" -> but V might be? 
But check positions: 
In ""CARVE"": 
- C at 1: good.
- A at 2: okay? Feedback didn't say anything about A at position 2? Actually, in feedback A was in position 3 and got '-' meaning A is not in position 3, but position 2 might be okay.
- R at 3: originally R was at position 2 and got '-', meaning R is not at position 2, but position 3 could be? 
But we don't know if R can be at position 3? We only know it's not at position 2.

Similarly, V is a new letter.

E is at position 5: but feedback said E is not at position 5? So we cannot have E at position 5. So ""CARVE"" would have E at position 5 -> bad.

Similarly, ""CARE"" is 4 letters, too short.

Another word: ""CREAM"". But ""CREAM"" has 5 letters: C,R,E,A,M. 
Now, positions:
- C at 1: good.
- R at 2: but R was at position 2 in the first guess and got a '-' meaning it's not in position 2? So same as ""CRATE"", R at position 2 is bad.

So we must choose a word where:
- R is not at position 2.
- A is not at position 3.
- E is not at position 5.

And the word must start with C.

We also need to include R, A, E, and one more letter (not N).

We have used C in position 1, so we need to assign R, A, E to positions 2,3,4,5? But we can't assign them to their disallowed positions.

So:
- Position 2: cannot be R? Actually, from feedback: R is not in position 2. But can other letters be there? Yes.
  For position 2, we cannot put R, but we can put A or E? Or the new letter? Actually, A and E can be in position 2? Yes, because A was placed at position 3 and got wrong, so it might be at 2? Similarly E.

But E was at position 5 and got wrong, so E can be at position 2? Yes.

Similarly, A can be at position 2? Yes.

So for position 2: we can put A, E, or a new letter? But we must use all of R, A, E? So we have to fit them in.

Let's list possible positions for each:

R: cannot be position 2 -> possible positions: 3 or 4 or ...? Only positions 3,4? Because position 5: we don't have information yet? But position 1 is taken by C, so R can be in 3,4,5? But position 5 might be possible? However, we know R must be in one of 3,4,5? Or 2nd, but 2nd is disallowed.

Similarly, A: cannot be position 3 -> possible positions: 2,4,5? 
E: cannot be position 5 -> possible positions: 2,3,4.

Now, we need to assign each of R, A, E to distinct positions from {2,3,4,5}, avoiding their disallowed positions.

But note: we have an additional letter, say X, which we don't know.

So the word: [C, ?, ?, ?, ?] where the ? are R,A,E and X in some order.

We have 4 positions: 2,3,4,5, and 4 letters: R, A, E, X.

But we need to assign R, A, E avoiding their disallowed positions, and X can go anywhere.

Since we have only one X, we can think of words that fit.

Try to fix the positions we can.

For example, E can be in positions: 2,3,4.
A can be in positions: 2,4,5? Wait, position 5? Previously feedback said E is not in position 5, but for A? Position 5 is okay for A? Because A was not present at position 5 in the first guess? Actually, we don't know about A at position 5? It might be okay.

Similarly, R can be in positions: 3,4,5? 

Now, to get more information, we might want to guess a word that tests these possibilities and covers new letters.

Also, we want to avoid using letters that we already know are not present, but so far we only know N is absent? And we haven't used any other.

Therefore, for the next guess, we should:
- Keep C at position 1 (since it's fixed).
- Assign R, A, E to positions that are not their disallowed ones, and introduce one new letter.

But note, we cannot assign R to position 2? That's fixed by feedback? Actually, feedback says R is in the word but not at position 2, so we must place R elsewhere.

Similarly, avoid A at position 3 and E at position 5.

Possible word?

Let me try to put:
- Position 2: E (since it can go there, and this tests E in a new position).
- But E was in position 5 originally, now we put at position 2.

But we have to assign R and A as well.

For example, ""C"" + ""E"" at position 2? Then what.

Word: create? But ""CREATE"" is 6 letters? Too long.

5-letter words: 

How about ""CLEAR""? But ""CLEAR"": C, L, E, A, R. 
But L is a new letter.

Check positions:
- Position 2: L? That's new -> okay? 
But we haven't placed R, A, E? In ""CLEAR"":
  Position 1: C (good)
  Position 2: L (new)
  Position 3: E -> but E was disallowed at position 5? But position 3 is new for E? Actually we can try E at position 3? Yes.
  Position 4: A -> but A was disallowed at position 3? Position 4 is okay? Yes.
  Position 5: R -> but R was disallowed at position 2? Position 5 is okay? Yes? Because feedback didn't say anything about position 5 for R? Only that R is not at position 2.

Also, note that E is at position 3: which is not position 5? So okay? But we don't know if E can be at position 3? We can test.

But we are putting E at position 3, A at position 4, R at position 5.

Are we required to have them all? Yes, so ""CLEAR"" has C, L, E, A, R -> L is new.

But does it include E, A, R? Yes: E at 3, A at 4, R at 5.

Now, check disallowed positions:
- A: feedback said A is not at position 3? We put A at position 4 -> okay.
- E: feedback said E is not at position 5? We put E at position 3 -> okay.
- R: feedback said R is not at position 2? We put R at position 5 -> okay.

So ""CLEAR"" seems fulfilling.

But note: in the first guess, we had C at position 1 and it was correct, so we keep that.

Another possibility: ""CRUEL""? 
""C"" + R at position 2? But R cannot be at position 2? So no, we cannot put R at position 2.

Similarly, ""CANAL"" has N? N is out. Also, doesn't have R? And we must have R.

Another word: ""CAUSE"" again: doesn't have R? Must have R.

So ""CLEAR"" seems like a valid guess.

But let's think: we have C, and then L, E, A, R.

The new letter introduced is L.

We might be able to use our knowledge: we haven't tested vowels? But we already have A and E.

Another word: ""CREAK""? 
But in ""CREAK"": 
- Position 2: R -> disallowed! (R cannot be at position 2)
So that's invalid.

Similarly, ""CRYPT""? But doesn't have A or E? We know the word contains A and E? Yes, from feedback.

Similarly, ""BARGE""? But doesn't start with C? We start with C.

So ""CLEAR"" is a good candidate.

We could do ""CARES""? But that has S? And E at position 5? Disallowed? Because E cannot be at position 5? So putting E at position 5 would be bad.

In ""CARES"": 
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: A -> might be okay? 
- Position 3: R -> wait, R was disallowed at position 2? Position 3 might be? Actually, we don't know for position 3? But A is at position 2? That's okay? 
- Position 4: E? Why not? 
- Position 5: S? 
But E is not at position 5? It's at position 4? Then position 5 is S? 
So E is at position 4? Then okay? 

But then R is at position 3? Which is okay? 

But how would ""CARES"" be spelled? C-A-R-E-S.

So: 
Position 1: C (good)
Position 2: A: originally A was at position 3 with '-' meaning not at 3? Position 2: we don't know? So can put A at 2? 
Position 3: R? But feedback for R: R was given at position 2 and got '-', meaning not at 2? Position 3: may be allowed? 
Position 4: E: which is not position 5? Okay.
Position 5: S.

So that passes the constraints? 

However, note we must have all letters: R, A, E and C? In ""CARES"", we have R, A, E? Yes: R at position 3, A at position 2, E at position 4, and C at position 1, S at position 5? So S is the extra letter.

But we don't know about S? It might be fine.

But let's compare: ""CLEAR"" and ""CARES""?

Both valid? But in ""CARES"":
- A is at position 2: which was not tested before? Similarly, in ""CLEAR"": new letter L.

Alternative: ""COVER""? But no A? Must have A.

Another: ""ASHEN""? Not C start.

We need to maximize information? But since we know E and A are in, but not where, and R similarly.

In ""CLEAR"", we test L as new letter? And put E at position 3, A at position 4, R at position 5.

In ""CARES"": we put A at position 2 (new), R at position 3 (new), E at position 4 (new), S at position 5.

Both seem useful? But ""CLEAR"" has the advantage that we shift all common letters to new positions? 

But note: originally E was at position 5, now at position 3? Similarly, A from position 3 to position 4? R from position 2 to position 5? So changing all.

Whereas in ""CARES"", A is moved to position 2? Which is different from original position 3? R to position 3 (from original 2? But original R at position 2, now at position 3? That's a shift by one? 

But ""CLEAR"" introduces L? Which might be common? But not as common as S? In word games, S is more common.

But also, we can consider another word: ""CATER""? But then E? We need E? So must have E.

Similarly, ""HAREM""? Not C start.

I think ""CARES"" or ""CLEAR"" might work, but let's think of others.

Another word: ""CRAMP""? But R at position 2? Disallowed? No: position 2 is R? Can't.

""TRACE""? Starts with T? Not C.

We must start with C.

So back to: 

Possible words: 
- ""CARES"": C A R E S. 
  Positions: 
    A at pos2 (which is different from orig.pos3)
    R at pos3 (orig was pos2? So next position? But we don't know if it helps? Might not be efficient? 
  But E at pos4? Fine.
  S at pos5.

But E was previously at position 5? Now we put E at position 4? Good test.

Similarly, ""CLEAR"": C L E A R
  E at pos3? Previously E was at pos5? 
  A at pos4? Previously A was at pos3?
  R at pos5? Previously R at pos2? So moved?

But which is better? 

Another candidate: ""EATEN""? Not C.

Perhaps ""REACT""? But starts with R? Not C.

""CHEAP""? Doesn't have R? Must have R.

So between ""CLEAR"" and ""CARES""?

We might choose one that avoids repeating letters? Both have distinct letters? ""CLEAR"": C,L,E,A,R -> distinct. 
""CARES"": C,A,R,E,S -> distinct.

Also, both test a new consonant: L or S?

In English, S is more frequent? But L is also common.

But we know the word contains E and A? So vowels are covered.

To maximize information: using common letters.

Another idea: since we know E and A are common, but already known, and we want to find the missing letter? And positions.

So introducing a letter like S might be more useful? Because plurals? But no, 5-letter word? Not necessarily plural.

But S is a very common letter.

Similarly, T is common? But we haven't tried T.

But in our first guess ""CRANE"", we had N excluded? T was not tested.

In ""CARES"": we introduce S? And in ""CLEAR"": introduce L.

Both are fine? I think ""CARES"" might be more typical? 

But note, in ""CARES"":
- If we put R at position 3? That was not the original position? But we don't know where R is? So we try one possibility.

But also, we can consider: the missing letter? In the word? For example, in the secret word, R, A, E could be sharing the other positions? So we need to assign them.

But let me try to think: position 2: can be A? And E? 
But if we put A at position 2? Then in ""CARES"", we have:
C A R E S : and position 5 is S? But we know E is not at position 5? Then if S is present? It might be? 

But what if the secret word has E at position 3? Or something? 

Perhaps better to choose a word that places some letters in positions we suspect? Actually, we have no strong constraint? 

But we might deduce: by the feedback? 

For example, since R is not at position 2, and it was in the word? So the word could have R at position 3,4 or 5? 

Similarly, E cannot be at position 5? So E at 2,3,4? 

A cannot be at position 3? So A at 2,4, or 5? 

Now, if we want to test position 5? For example, we can put R at position 5? Or A? Or a new letter? 

I think ""CLEAR"" and ""CARES"" both are valid? 

Another idea: ""CRIER""? But R at position 2? Disallowed? Position 2 is R? No.

""RAINY""? Not C.

I think ""CARES"" is a good choice? Or ""CLEAR""? 

Perhaps ""CAULE""? Not a word.

Decide: let's use ""CARES"".

But wait: ""CARES"" has C,A,R,E,S.

After first guess feedback: we know R is not at position 2? But in ""CARES"", we put R at position 3? Okay? 

Similarly, E is at position 4? Not position 5? So okay.

But note: we also have A at position 2? Is there a conflict? Feedback for the first guess: A was at position 3 and got '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. Position 2 was position for R at that time? We don't have info about A at position 2? So can put A at position 2? Yes.

Similarly, S at position 5? We don't know.

So ""CARES"" should be fine.

But let's see: if the secret word were ""CARVE"", then R is not at position 2? Actually ""CARVE"" has R at position 3. And E at position 5? But feedback for ""CRANE"" showed E not at position 5? So E cannot be at position 5? So ""CARVE"" as secret? But E at position 5? Then feedback would have shown E with 'x', not '-'? Because '-' means present but wrong position? If E were at position 5 in the secret word, then when placed at position 5? If it were correct? But in secret word ""CARVE"", E is at position 5? And our guess was ""CRANE"": position 5 E? If secret ""CARVE"", then position 5: E? Then the feedback for ""CRANE"" position 5 would be ✓? Because E is at position 5? 

But here feedback for ""CRANE"" position 5: E showed '-', meaning it is in the word but not position 5? Therefore, E cannot be at position 5? So secret word cannot have E at position 5? Thus ""CARVE"" is impossible? Because it has E at position 5? So we don't need to consider? 

Therefore, our reasoning.

So back to: we are free to choose a word with C, and having A,R,E in positions 2,3,4? Or etc? 

But in ""CARES"": 
Position 2: A -> this tells us if A is at position 2? 
Position 3: R -> tells if R at position 3? 
Position 4: E -> tells if E at position 4? 
Position 5: S -> tells if S in the word? 

Whereas ""CLEAR"":
Position 2: L -> new letter test
Position 3: E -> E at position 3?
Position 4: A -> A at position 4?
Position 5: R -> R at position 5?

Both are good? I think both can work? But let's pick ""CARES"" because S might be more common? 

But also we are in step-by-step: so I'll go with ""CARES"".

But another option: ""SCARE""? but doesn't start with C? We must start with C? Because the first position C is fixed? So position 1 must be C? So no, ""SCARE"" starts with S.

Therefore, only option like ""CARES""?

No: we have ""CLARE""? Not a common word? Often ""CLAIRE"" is 6 letters? So not.

""CEASE""? But E at position 2? And A at position 3? But feedback said A not at position 3? So we shouldn't put A at position 3? But in ""CEASE"":
C E A S E? Positions:
Position 2: E -> okay? 
Position 3: A -> disallowed? Because feedback said A is in the word but not in position 3? So if we put A at position 3, that would be incorrect? And we know it shouldn't be there? So why try? That would be a waste? 

Therefore, we should avoid putting A at position 3? Because we already know it's wrong? 

Similarly, we must not put A at position 3 in our guess? Because it would definitely not be ✓? So it is better to place it elsewhere to test.

Therefore, ""CEASE"" should not be used? Because we put A at position 3? But we know it is wrong? So we would only get a '-'? But we can still get '-'? But we know it is present? So it doesn't help? Better to put A in a new position? 

Similarly, we should avoid:
- Putting R at position 2? Definitely no.
- Putting A at position 3? Definitely no.
- Putting E at position 5? Definitely no.

So in our new guess, place R at position 3,4, or 5? But not 2.
Place A at position 2,4, or 5? But not 3.
Place E at position 2,3, or 4? But not 5.

Therefore, in our new guess:
- Position 2: not R? And can be A, E, or new letter.
- Position 3: not A? And can be R, E, or new letter.
- Position 4: can be any of R, A, E, new?
- Position 5: not E? And must be R,A, or new? Because E cannot be at 5.

But we are trying to cover R, A, E.

In ""CARES"":
Pos2: A -> used, and allowed? (A not at pos3, now at pos2? So okay)
Pos3: R -> used, and allowed? (R not at pos2, now at pos3? Okay)
Pos4: E -> used, and allowed? (E not at pos5, now at pos4? Okay)
Pos5: S -> new letter.

So perfect.

In ""CLEAR"":
Pos2: L -> new
Pos3: E -> used, allowed? (E not at pos5, now at pos3? Okay)
Pos4: A -> used, and not at pos3? Putting at pos4? Okay.
Pos5: R -> used, and not at pos2? Putting at pos5? Okay.

Also perfect.

But to decide: let's count? Or, since S is more frequent, maybe ""CARES"" might be slightly better? 

But L is also common? 

I recall that ""adieu"" might be a follow up? But not here? 

Another word: ""OATER""? Not C.

Perhaps ""CARTE"" was invalid because E at 5? But we know E not at position 5? So no.

Conclusion: either ""CARES"" or ""CLEAR"".

Let's choose ""CARES"".

But the word ""CARES"" is valid? Yes.

So guessed word: ""CARES""

Therefore, we return:
</think>
We have the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": C(✓), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(-). This means:
- C is in the secret word and in position 1.
- R, A, and E are in the secret word but not in positions 2, 3, or 5 respectively.
- N is not in the secret word.

For the second guess:
- Position 1 must be C (fixed per feedback).
- R cannot be in position 2.
- A cannot be in position 3.
- E cannot be in position 5.
- The guess must include R, A, and E (since they are in the word) and one new untested letter (as N is excluded).
- Positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 should contain R, A, E, and the new letter, avoiding the disallowed assignments.

The word ""CARES"" fits these constraints:
- Starts with C.
- Positions: 
  - A at position 2 (not disallowed).
  - R at position 3 (not disallowed, as it was only forbidden in position 2).
  - E at position 4 (not disallowed, as it was only forbidden in position 5).
  - New letter S at position 5.
This allows us to test new positions for A, R, E and introduce a common new letter (S) for further elimination.

<guess>cares</guess>",cares,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but wrong position)

So, from the feedback:
- The secret word has C in the first position (because ✓).
- The secret word contains R, A, and E, but not in the positions guessed (positions 2, 3, and 5 respectively).
- The letter N is not in the secret word at all.

We know:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: Cannot be R (because R is in the word but not here), and cannot be N (excluded).
- Position 3: Cannot be A, and cannot be N.
- Position 4: Cannot be N? Actually, N is entirely absent, so no position can have N.
- Position 5: Cannot be E, but E is present elsewhere.

Also, R, A, E must appear in the word, but in positions other than 2, 3, and 5 respectively.

So the word we are looking for:
- Starts with C.
- Contains R, A, E (and C we already have at position 1).
- Does not contain N.

Moreover, since R, A, E are not in positions 2, 3, 5, but must appear somewhere else.

Possible positions for R, A, E:
- R: cannot be in position 2, so it must be in position 3, 4, or ?
  Actually, positions we have: 1,2,3,4,5.
  Position 1 is C (fixed), so R must be in 3,4? Or ... wait, we have position 1 taken by C, so R can be in 3,4, or possibly 5? But position 5 was E in the guess, but E is in the word and not in position 5, so R could be in position 5? Yes.

Similarly for A: it was in position 3 in the guess, so cannot be in position 3. So it can be in position 2,4,5? But position 1 is C, so not available.

Similarly for E: it was in position 5 in the guess, so cannot be in position 5. So it can be in position 2,3,4.

Now, note that we have exactly 5 letters: C, R, A, E, and one more? Because we know four letters: C, R, A, E are in, but the word has 5 letters. So there is one more letter.

We also know N is out.

So the word must be: C ? ? ? ? 
with letters including R, A, E and one more letter.

We need to form a word that starts with C, and contains R, A, E.

We also know the positions that are disallowed for some letters.

Let me think of words that start with C and have R, A, E.

For example: ""CRATE"", ""CRANE"" but we tried crane and N is out, so no. ""CRATE"" has T instead of N.

But let's check the positions:

In ""CRATE"":
- C is position 1 -> correct.
- R is position 2 -> but feedback said R is not in position 2? Yes, because R got a '-', meaning it's not in position 2. So if we guess ""CRATE"", R would be in position 2, which is forbidden.

Therefore, ""CRATE"" is invalid because R should not be in position 2.

Other words: ""CARTE""? But E is at position 5? But feedback says E cannot be in position 5? Actually, in feedback E got '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 5. So if we put E at position 5, that would be wrong.

In ""CARTE"":
- Position 1: C (good)
- Position 2: A -> but originally A was in position 3 and got '-', so it must not be in position 3? But position 2 might be okay? We don't know yet.

We have to avoid:
- R in position 2 (from feedback)
- A in position 3 (from feedback)
- E in position 5 (from feedback)

So in our next guess, we should avoid these positions for those letters.

Moreover, we have one more letter to find.

Let me list possible words: ""C"" words that contain R, A, E.

Possible: ""CAUSE"", but that has U and S? And does not have R? We must have R.

We know the word must contain R, A, E (and C).

So letters: C, R, A, E, and one unknown.

We also know N is not in the word.

Looking for words: 
- Starting with C
- Having R, A, E

For example: ""CRANE"" we tried -> ruled out by N and feedback.
""CRATE"" -> R at position 2, which is bad (R is not at position 2).

""CARVE"" -> but V might be? 
But check positions: 
In ""CARVE"": 
- C at 1: good.
- A at 2: okay? Feedback didn't say anything about A at position 2? Actually, in feedback A was in position 3 and got '-' meaning A is not in position 3, but position 2 might be okay.
- R at 3: originally R was at position 2 and got '-', meaning R is not at position 2, but position 3 could be? 
But we don't know if R can be at position 3? We only know it's not at position 2.

Similarly, V is a new letter.

E is at position 5: but feedback said E is not at position 5? So we cannot have E at position 5. So ""CARVE"" would have E at position 5 -> bad.

Similarly, ""CARE"" is 4 letters, too short.

Another word: ""CREAM"". But ""CREAM"" has 5 letters: C,R,E,A,M. 
Now, positions:
- C at 1: good.
- R at 2: but R was at position 2 in the first guess and got a '-' meaning it's not in position 2? So same as ""CRATE"", R at position 2 is bad.

So we must choose a word where:
- R is not at position 2.
- A is not at position 3.
- E is not at position 5.

And the word must start with C.

We also need to include R, A, E, and one more letter (not N).

We have used C in position 1, so we need to assign R, A, E to positions 2,3,4,5? But we can't assign them to their disallowed positions.

So:
- Position 2: cannot be R? Actually, from feedback: R is not in position 2. But can other letters be there? Yes.
  For position 2, we cannot put R, but we can put A or E? Or the new letter? Actually, A and E can be in position 2? Yes, because A was placed at position 3 and got wrong, so it might be at 2? Similarly E.

But E was at position 5 and got wrong, so E can be at position 2? Yes.

Similarly, A can be at position 2? Yes.

So for position 2: we can put A, E, or a new letter? But we must use all of R, A, E? So we have to fit them in.

Let's list possible positions for each:

R: cannot be position 2 -> possible positions: 3 or 4 or ...? Only positions 3,4? Because position 5: we don't have information yet? But position 1 is taken by C, so R can be in 3,4,5? But position 5 might be possible? However, we know R must be in one of 3,4,5? Or 2nd, but 2nd is disallowed.

Similarly, A: cannot be position 3 -> possible positions: 2,4,5? 
E: cannot be position 5 -> possible positions: 2,3,4.

Now, we need to assign each of R, A, E to distinct positions from {2,3,4,5}, avoiding their disallowed positions.

But note: we have an additional letter, say X, which we don't know.

So the word: [C, ?, ?, ?, ?] where the ? are R,A,E and X in some order.

We have 4 positions: 2,3,4,5, and 4 letters: R, A, E, X.

But we need to assign R, A, E avoiding their disallowed positions, and X can go anywhere.

Since we have only one X, we can think of words that fit.

Try to fix the positions we can.

For example, E can be in positions: 2,3,4.
A can be in positions: 2,4,5? Wait, position 5? Previously feedback said E is not in position 5, but for A? Position 5 is okay for A? Because A was not present at position 5 in the first guess? Actually, we don't know about A at position 5? It might be okay.

Similarly, R can be in positions: 3,4,5? 

Now, to get more information, we might want to guess a word that tests these possibilities and covers new letters.

Also, we want to avoid using letters that we already know are not present, but so far we only know N is absent? And we haven't used any other.

Therefore, for the next guess, we should:
- Keep C at position 1 (since it's fixed).
- Assign R, A, E to positions that are not their disallowed ones, and introduce one new letter.

But note, we cannot assign R to position 2? That's fixed by feedback? Actually, feedback says R is in the word but not at position 2, so we must place R elsewhere.

Similarly, avoid A at position 3 and E at position 5.

Possible word?

Let me try to put:
- Position 2: E (since it can go there, and this tests E in a new position).
- But E was in position 5 originally, now we put at position 2.

But we have to assign R and A as well.

For example, ""C"" + ""E"" at position 2? Then what.

Word: create? But ""CREATE"" is 6 letters? Too long.

5-letter words: 

How about ""CLEAR""? But ""CLEAR"": C, L, E, A, R. 
But L is a new letter.

Check positions:
- Position 2: L? That's new -> okay? 
But we haven't placed R, A, E? In ""CLEAR"":
  Position 1: C (good)
  Position 2: L (new)
  Position 3: E -> but E was disallowed at position 5? But position 3 is new for E? Actually we can try E at position 3? Yes.
  Position 4: A -> but A was disallowed at position 3? Position 4 is okay? Yes.
  Position 5: R -> but R was disallowed at position 2? Position 5 is okay? Yes? Because feedback didn't say anything about position 5 for R? Only that R is not at position 2.

Also, note that E is at position 3: which is not position 5? So okay? But we don't know if E can be at position 3? We can test.

But we are putting E at position 3, A at position 4, R at position 5.

Are we required to have them all? Yes, so ""CLEAR"" has C, L, E, A, R -> L is new.

But does it include E, A, R? Yes: E at 3, A at 4, R at 5.

Now, check disallowed positions:
- A: feedback said A is not at position 3? We put A at position 4 -> okay.
- E: feedback said E is not at position 5? We put E at position 3 -> okay.
- R: feedback said R is not at position 2? We put R at position 5 -> okay.

So ""CLEAR"" seems fulfilling.

But note: in the first guess, we had C at position 1 and it was correct, so we keep that.

Another possibility: ""CRUEL""? 
""C"" + R at position 2? But R cannot be at position 2? So no, we cannot put R at position 2.

Similarly, ""CANAL"" has N? N is out. Also, doesn't have R? And we must have R.

Another word: ""CAUSE"" again: doesn't have R? Must have R.

So ""CLEAR"" seems like a valid guess.

But let's think: we have C, and then L, E, A, R.

The new letter introduced is L.

We might be able to use our knowledge: we haven't tested vowels? But we already have A and E.

Another word: ""CREAK""? 
But in ""CREAK"": 
- Position 2: R -> disallowed! (R cannot be at position 2)
So that's invalid.

Similarly, ""CRYPT""? But doesn't have A or E? We know the word contains A and E? Yes, from feedback.

Similarly, ""BARGE""? But doesn't start with C? We start with C.

So ""CLEAR"" is a good candidate.

We could do ""CARES""? But that has S? And E at position 5? Disallowed? Because E cannot be at position 5? So putting E at position 5 would be bad.

In ""CARES"": 
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: A -> might be okay? 
- Position 3: R -> wait, R was disallowed at position 2? Position 3 might be? Actually, we don't know for position 3? But A is at position 2? That's okay? 
- Position 4: E? Why not? 
- Position 5: S? 
But E is not at position 5? It's at position 4? Then position 5 is S? 
So E is at position 4? Then okay? 

But then R is at position 3? Which is okay? 

But how would ""CARES"" be spelled? C-A-R-E-S.

So: 
Position 1: C (good)
Position 2: A: originally A was at position 3 with '-' meaning not at 3? Position 2: we don't know? So can put A at 2? 
Position 3: R? But feedback for R: R was given at position 2 and got '-', meaning not at 2? Position 3: may be allowed? 
Position 4: E: which is not position 5? Okay.
Position 5: S.

So that passes the constraints? 

However, note we must have all letters: R, A, E and C? In ""CARES"", we have R, A, E? Yes: R at position 3, A at position 2, E at position 4, and C at position 1, S at position 5? So S is the extra letter.

But we don't know about S? It might be fine.

But let's compare: ""CLEAR"" and ""CARES""?

Both valid? But in ""CARES"":
- A is at position 2: which was not tested before? Similarly, in ""CLEAR"": new letter L.

Alternative: ""COVER""? But no A? Must have A.

Another: ""ASHEN""? Not C start.

We need to maximize information? But since we know E and A are in, but not where, and R similarly.

In ""CLEAR"", we test L as new letter? And put E at position 3, A at position 4, R at position 5.

In ""CARES"": we put A at position 2 (new), R at position 3 (new), E at position 4 (new), S at position 5.

Both seem useful? But ""CLEAR"" has the advantage that we shift all common letters to new positions? 

But note: originally E was at position 5, now at position 3? Similarly, A from position 3 to position 4? R from position 2 to position 5? So changing all.

Whereas in ""CARES"", A is moved to position 2? Which is different from original position 3? R to position 3 (from original 2? But original R at position 2, now at position 3? That's a shift by one? 

But ""CLEAR"" introduces L? Which might be common? But not as common as S? In word games, S is more common.

But also, we can consider another word: ""CATER""? But then E? We need E? So must have E.

Similarly, ""HAREM""? Not C start.

I think ""CARES"" or ""CLEAR"" might work, but let's think of others.

Another word: ""CRAMP""? But R at position 2? Disallowed? No: position 2 is R? Can't.

""TRACE""? Starts with T? Not C.

We must start with C.

So back to: 

Possible words: 
- ""CARES"": C A R E S. 
  Positions: 
    A at pos2 (which is different from orig.pos3)
    R at pos3 (orig was pos2? So next position? But we don't know if it helps? Might not be efficient? 
  But E at pos4? Fine.
  S at pos5.

But E was previously at position 5? Now we put E at position 4? Good test.

Similarly, ""CLEAR"": C L E A R
  E at pos3? Previously E was at pos5? 
  A at pos4? Previously A was at pos3?
  R at pos5? Previously R at pos2? So moved?

But which is better? 

Another candidate: ""EATEN""? Not C.

Perhaps ""REACT""? But starts with R? Not C.

""CHEAP""? Doesn't have R? Must have R.

So between ""CLEAR"" and ""CARES""?

We might choose one that avoids repeating letters? Both have distinct letters? ""CLEAR"": C,L,E,A,R -> distinct. 
""CARES"": C,A,R,E,S -> distinct.

Also, both test a new consonant: L or S?

In English, S is more frequent? But L is also common.

But we know the word contains E and A? So vowels are covered.

To maximize information: using common letters.

Another idea: since we know E and A are common, but already known, and we want to find the missing letter? And positions.

So introducing a letter like S might be more useful? Because plurals? But no, 5-letter word? Not necessarily plural.

But S is a very common letter.

Similarly, T is common? But we haven't tried T.

But in our first guess ""CRANE"", we had N excluded? T was not tested.

In ""CARES"": we introduce S? And in ""CLEAR"": introduce L.

Both are fine? I think ""CARES"" might be more typical? 

But note, in ""CARES"":
- If we put R at position 3? That was not the original position? But we don't know where R is? So we try one possibility.

But also, we can consider: the missing letter? In the word? For example, in the secret word, R, A, E could be sharing the other positions? So we need to assign them.

But let me try to think: position 2: can be A? And E? 
But if we put A at position 2? Then in ""CARES"", we have:
C A R E S : and position 5 is S? But we know E is not at position 5? Then if S is present? It might be? 

But what if the secret word has E at position 3? Or something? 

Perhaps better to choose a word that places some letters in positions we suspect? Actually, we have no strong constraint? 

But we might deduce: by the feedback? 

For example, since R is not at position 2, and it was in the word? So the word could have R at position 3,4 or 5? 

Similarly, E cannot be at position 5? So E at 2,3,4? 

A cannot be at position 3? So A at 2,4, or 5? 

Now, if we want to test position 5? For example, we can put R at position 5? Or A? Or a new letter? 

I think ""CLEAR"" and ""CARES"" both are valid? 

Another idea: ""CRIER""? But R at position 2? Disallowed? Position 2 is R? No.

""RAINY""? Not C.

I think ""CARES"" is a good choice? Or ""CLEAR""? 

Perhaps ""CAULE""? Not a word.

Decide: let's use ""CARES"".

But wait: ""CARES"" has C,A,R,E,S.

After first guess feedback: we know R is not at position 2? But in ""CARES"", we put R at position 3? Okay? 

Similarly, E is at position 4? Not position 5? So okay.

But note: we also have A at position 2? Is there a conflict? Feedback for the first guess: A was at position 3 and got '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. Position 2 was position for R at that time? We don't have info about A at position 2? So can put A at position 2? Yes.

Similarly, S at position 5? We don't know.

So ""CARES"" should be fine.

But let's see: if the secret word were ""CARVE"", then R is not at position 2? Actually ""CARVE"" has R at position 3. And E at position 5? But feedback for ""CRANE"" showed E not at position 5? So E cannot be at position 5? So ""CARVE"" as secret? But E at position 5? Then feedback would have shown E with 'x', not '-'? Because '-' means present but wrong position? If E were at position 5 in the secret word, then when placed at position 5? If it were correct? But in secret word ""CARVE"", E is at position 5? And our guess was ""CRANE"": position 5 E? If secret ""CARVE"", then position 5: E? Then the feedback for ""CRANE"" position 5 would be ✓? Because E is at position 5? 

But here feedback for ""CRANE"" position 5: E showed '-', meaning it is in the word but not position 5? Therefore, E cannot be at position 5? So secret word cannot have E at position 5? Thus ""CARVE"" is impossible? Because it has E at position 5? So we don't need to consider? 

Therefore, our reasoning.

So back to: we are free to choose a word with C, and having A,R,E in positions 2,3,4? Or etc? 

But in ""CARES"": 
Position 2: A -> this tells us if A is at position 2? 
Position 3: R -> tells if R at position 3? 
Position 4: E -> tells if E at position 4? 
Position 5: S -> tells if S in the word? 

Whereas ""CLEAR"":
Position 2: L -> new letter test
Position 3: E -> E at position 3?
Position 4: A -> A at position 4?
Position 5: R -> R at position 5?

Both are good? I think both can work? But let's pick ""CARES"" because S might be more common? 

But also we are in step-by-step: so I'll go with ""CARES"".

But another option: ""SCARE""? but doesn't start with C? We must start with C? Because the first position C is fixed? So position 1 must be C? So no, ""SCARE"" starts with S.

Therefore, only option like ""CARES""?

No: we have ""CLARE""? Not a common word? Often ""CLAIRE"" is 6 letters? So not.

""CEASE""? But E at position 2? And A at position 3? But feedback said A not at position 3? So we shouldn't put A at position 3? But in ""CEASE"":
C E A S E? Positions:
Position 2: E -> okay? 
Position 3: A -> disallowed? Because feedback said A is in the word but not in position 3? So if we put A at position 3, that would be incorrect? And we know it shouldn't be there? So why try? That would be a waste? 

Therefore, we should avoid putting A at position 3? Because we already know it's wrong? 

Similarly, we must not put A at position 3 in our guess? Because it would definitely not be ✓? So it is better to place it elsewhere to test.

Therefore, ""CEASE"" should not be used? Because we put A at position 3? But we know it is wrong? So we would only get a '-'? But we can still get '-'? But we know it is present? So it doesn't help? Better to put A in a new position? 

Similarly, we should avoid:
- Putting R at position 2? Definitely no.
- Putting A at position 3? Definitely no.
- Putting E at position 5? Definitely no.

So in our new guess, place R at position 3,4, or 5? But not 2.
Place A at position 2,4, or 5? But not 3.
Place E at position 2,3, or 4? But not 5.

Therefore, in our new guess:
- Position 2: not R? And can be A, E, or new letter.
- Position 3: not A? And can be R, E, or new letter.
- Position 4: can be any of R, A, E, new?
- Position 5: not E? And must be R,A, or new? Because E cannot be at 5.

But we are trying to cover R, A, E.

In ""CARES"":
Pos2: A -> used, and allowed? (A not at pos3, now at pos2? So okay)
Pos3: R -> used, and allowed? (R not at pos2, now at pos3? Okay)
Pos4: E -> used, and allowed? (E not at pos5, now at pos4? Okay)
Pos5: S -> new letter.

So perfect.

In ""CLEAR"":
Pos2: L -> new
Pos3: E -> used, allowed? (E not at pos5, now at pos3? Okay)
Pos4: A -> used, and not at pos3? Putting at pos4? Okay.
Pos5: R -> used, and not at pos2? Putting at pos5? Okay.

Also perfect.

But to decide: let's count? Or, since S is more frequent, maybe ""CARES"" might be slightly better? 

But L is also common? 

I recall that ""adieu"" might be a follow up? But not here? 

Another word: ""OATER""? Not C.

Perhaps ""CARTE"" was invalid because E at 5? But we know E not at position 5? So no.

Conclusion: either ""CARES"" or ""CLEAR"".

Let's choose ""CARES"".

But the word ""CARES"" is valid? Yes.

So guessed word: ""CARES""

Therefore, we return:We have the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": C(✓), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(-). This means:
- C is in the secret word and in position 1.
- R, A, and E are in the secret word but not in positions 2, 3, or 5 respectively.
- N is not in the secret word.

For the second guess:
- Position 1 must be C (fixed per feedback).
- R cannot be in position 2.
- A cannot be in position 3.
- E cannot be in position 5.
- The guess must include R, A, and E (since they are in the word) and one new untested letter (as N is excluded).
- Positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 should contain R, A, E, and the new letter, avoiding the disallowed assignments.

The word ""CARES"" fits these constraints:
- Starts with C.
- Positions: 
  - A at position 2 (not disallowed).
  - R at position 3 (not disallowed, as it was only forbidden in position 2).
  - E at position 4 (not disallowed, as it was only forbidden in position 5).
  - New letter S at position 5.
This allows us to test new positions for A, R, E and introduce a common new letter (S) for further elimination.",Guess 2: cares -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) S(x),FAIL

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but wrong position)

So, from the feedback:
- The secret word has C in the first position (because ✓).
- The secret word contains R, A, and E, but not in the positions guessed (positions 2, 3, and 5 respectively).
- The letter N is not in the secret word at all.

We know:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: Cannot be R (because R is in the word but not here), and cannot be N (excluded).
- Position 3: Cannot be A, and cannot be N.
- Position 4: Cannot be N? Actually, N is entirely absent, so no position can have N.
- Position 5: Cannot be E, but E is present elsewhere.

Also, R, A, E must appear in the word, but in positions other than 2, 3, and 5 respectively.

So the word we are looking for:
- Starts with C.
- Contains R, A, E (and C we already have at position 1).
- Does not contain N.

Moreover, since R, A, E are not in positions 2, 3, 5, but must appear somewhere else.

Possible positions for R, A, E:
- R: cannot be in position 2, so it must be in position 3, 4, or ?
  Actually, positions we have: 1,2,3,4,5.
  Position 1 is C (fixed), so R must be in 3,4? Or ... wait, we have position 1 taken by C, so R can be in 3,4, or possibly 5? But position 5 was E in the guess, but E is in the word and not in position 5, so R could be in position 5? Yes.

Similarly for A: it was in position 3 in the guess, so cannot be in position 3. So it can be in position 2,4,5? But position 1 is C, so not available.

Similarly for E: it was in position 5 in the guess, so cannot be in position 5. So it can be in position 2,3,4.

Now, note that we have exactly 5 letters: C, R, A, E, and one more? Because we know four letters: C, R, A, E are in, but the word has 5 letters. So there is one more letter.

We also know N is out.

So the word must be: C ? ? ? ? 
with letters including R, A, E and one more letter.

We need to form a word that starts with C, and contains R, A, E.

We also know the positions that are disallowed for some letters.

Let me think of words that start with C and have R, A, E.

For example: ""CRATE"", ""CRANE"" but we tried crane and N is out, so no. ""CRATE"" has T instead of N.

But let's check the positions:

In ""CRATE"":
- C is position 1 -> correct.
- R is position 2 -> but feedback said R is not in position 2? Yes, because R got a '-', meaning it's not in position 2. So if we guess ""CRATE"", R would be in position 2, which is forbidden.

Therefore, ""CRATE"" is invalid because R should not be in position 2.

Other words: ""CARTE""? But E is at position 5? But feedback says E cannot be in position 5? Actually, in feedback E got '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 5. So if we put E at position 5, that would be wrong.

In ""CARTE"":
- Position 1: C (good)
- Position 2: A -> but originally A was in position 3 and got '-', so it must not be in position 3? But position 2 might be okay? We don't know yet.

We have to avoid:
- R in position 2 (from feedback)
- A in position 3 (from feedback)
- E in position 5 (from feedback)

So in our next guess, we should avoid these positions for those letters.

Moreover, we have one more letter to find.

Let me list possible words: ""C"" words that contain R, A, E.

Possible: ""CAUSE"", but that has U and S? And does not have R? We must have R.

We know the word must contain R, A, E (and C).

So letters: C, R, A, E, and one unknown.

We also know N is not in the word.

Looking for words: 
- Starting with C
- Having R, A, E

For example: ""CRANE"" we tried -> ruled out by N and feedback.
""CRATE"" -> R at position 2, which is bad (R is not at position 2).

""CARVE"" -> but V might be? 
But check positions: 
In ""CARVE"": 
- C at 1: good.
- A at 2: okay? Feedback didn't say anything about A at position 2? Actually, in feedback A was in position 3 and got '-' meaning A is not in position 3, but position 2 might be okay.
- R at 3: originally R was at position 2 and got '-', meaning R is not at position 2, but position 3 could be? 
But we don't know if R can be at position 3? We only know it's not at position 2.

Similarly, V is a new letter.

E is at position 5: but feedback said E is not at position 5? So we cannot have E at position 5. So ""CARVE"" would have E at position 5 -> bad.

Similarly, ""CARE"" is 4 letters, too short.

Another word: ""CREAM"". But ""CREAM"" has 5 letters: C,R,E,A,M. 
Now, positions:
- C at 1: good.
- R at 2: but R was at position 2 in the first guess and got a '-' meaning it's not in position 2? So same as ""CRATE"", R at position 2 is bad.

So we must choose a word where:
- R is not at position 2.
- A is not at position 3.
- E is not at position 5.

And the word must start with C.

We also need to include R, A, E, and one more letter (not N).

We have used C in position 1, so we need to assign R, A, E to positions 2,3,4,5? But we can't assign them to their disallowed positions.

So:
- Position 2: cannot be R? Actually, from feedback: R is not in position 2. But can other letters be there? Yes.
  For position 2, we cannot put R, but we can put A or E? Or the new letter? Actually, A and E can be in position 2? Yes, because A was placed at position 3 and got wrong, so it might be at 2? Similarly E.

But E was at position 5 and got wrong, so E can be at position 2? Yes.

Similarly, A can be at position 2? Yes.

So for position 2: we can put A, E, or a new letter? But we must use all of R, A, E? So we have to fit them in.

Let's list possible positions for each:

R: cannot be position 2 -> possible positions: 3 or 4 or ...? Only positions 3,4? Because position 5: we don't have information yet? But position 1 is taken by C, so R can be in 3,4,5? But position 5 might be possible? However, we know R must be in one of 3,4,5? Or 2nd, but 2nd is disallowed.

Similarly, A: cannot be position 3 -> possible positions: 2,4,5? 
E: cannot be position 5 -> possible positions: 2,3,4.

Now, we need to assign each of R, A, E to distinct positions from {2,3,4,5}, avoiding their disallowed positions.

But note: we have an additional letter, say X, which we don't know.

So the word: [C, ?, ?, ?, ?] where the ? are R,A,E and X in some order.

We have 4 positions: 2,3,4,5, and 4 letters: R, A, E, X.

But we need to assign R, A, E avoiding their disallowed positions, and X can go anywhere.

Since we have only one X, we can think of words that fit.

Try to fix the positions we can.

For example, E can be in positions: 2,3,4.
A can be in positions: 2,4,5? Wait, position 5? Previously feedback said E is not in position 5, but for A? Position 5 is okay for A? Because A was not present at position 5 in the first guess? Actually, we don't know about A at position 5? It might be okay.

Similarly, R can be in positions: 3,4,5? 

Now, to get more information, we might want to guess a word that tests these possibilities and covers new letters.

Also, we want to avoid using letters that we already know are not present, but so far we only know N is absent? And we haven't used any other.

Therefore, for the next guess, we should:
- Keep C at position 1 (since it's fixed).
- Assign R, A, E to positions that are not their disallowed ones, and introduce one new letter.

But note, we cannot assign R to position 2? That's fixed by feedback? Actually, feedback says R is in the word but not at position 2, so we must place R elsewhere.

Similarly, avoid A at position 3 and E at position 5.

Possible word?

Let me try to put:
- Position 2: E (since it can go there, and this tests E in a new position).
- But E was in position 5 originally, now we put at position 2.

But we have to assign R and A as well.

For example, ""C"" + ""E"" at position 2? Then what.

Word: create? But ""CREATE"" is 6 letters? Too long.

5-letter words: 

How about ""CLEAR""? But ""CLEAR"": C, L, E, A, R. 
But L is a new letter.

Check positions:
- Position 2: L? That's new -> okay? 
But we haven't placed R, A, E? In ""CLEAR"":
  Position 1: C (good)
  Position 2: L (new)
  Position 3: E -> but E was disallowed at position 5? But position 3 is new for E? Actually we can try E at position 3? Yes.
  Position 4: A -> but A was disallowed at position 3? Position 4 is okay? Yes.
  Position 5: R -> but R was disallowed at position 2? Position 5 is okay? Yes? Because feedback didn't say anything about position 5 for R? Only that R is not at position 2.

Also, note that E is at position 3: which is not position 5? So okay? But we don't know if E can be at position 3? We can test.

But we are putting E at position 3, A at position 4, R at position 5.

Are we required to have them all? Yes, so ""CLEAR"" has C, L, E, A, R -> L is new.

But does it include E, A, R? Yes: E at 3, A at 4, R at 5.

Now, check disallowed positions:
- A: feedback said A is not at position 3? We put A at position 4 -> okay.
- E: feedback said E is not at position 5? We put E at position 3 -> okay.
- R: feedback said R is not at position 2? We put R at position 5 -> okay.

So ""CLEAR"" seems fulfilling.

But note: in the first guess, we had C at position 1 and it was correct, so we keep that.

Another possibility: ""CRUEL""? 
""C"" + R at position 2? But R cannot be at position 2? So no, we cannot put R at position 2.

Similarly, ""CANAL"" has N? N is out. Also, doesn't have R? And we must have R.

Another word: ""CAUSE"" again: doesn't have R? Must have R.

So ""CLEAR"" seems like a valid guess.

But let's think: we have C, and then L, E, A, R.

The new letter introduced is L.

We might be able to use our knowledge: we haven't tested vowels? But we already have A and E.

Another word: ""CREAK""? 
But in ""CREAK"": 
- Position 2: R -> disallowed! (R cannot be at position 2)
So that's invalid.

Similarly, ""CRYPT""? But doesn't have A or E? We know the word contains A and E? Yes, from feedback.

Similarly, ""BARGE""? But doesn't start with C? We start with C.

So ""CLEAR"" is a good candidate.

We could do ""CARES""? But that has S? And E at position 5? Disallowed? Because E cannot be at position 5? So putting E at position 5 would be bad.

In ""CARES"": 
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: A -> might be okay? 
- Position 3: R -> wait, R was disallowed at position 2? Position 3 might be? Actually, we don't know for position 3? But A is at position 2? That's okay? 
- Position 4: E? Why not? 
- Position 5: S? 
But E is not at position 5? It's at position 4? Then position 5 is S? 
So E is at position 4? Then okay? 

But then R is at position 3? Which is okay? 

But how would ""CARES"" be spelled? C-A-R-E-S.

So: 
Position 1: C (good)
Position 2: A: originally A was at position 3 with '-' meaning not at 3? Position 2: we don't know? So can put A at 2? 
Position 3: R? But feedback for R: R was given at position 2 and got '-', meaning not at 2? Position 3: may be allowed? 
Position 4: E: which is not position 5? Okay.
Position 5: S.

So that passes the constraints? 

However, note we must have all letters: R, A, E and C? In ""CARES"", we have R, A, E? Yes: R at position 3, A at position 2, E at position 4, and C at position 1, S at position 5? So S is the extra letter.

But we don't know about S? It might be fine.

But let's compare: ""CLEAR"" and ""CARES""?

Both valid? But in ""CARES"":
- A is at position 2: which was not tested before? Similarly, in ""CLEAR"": new letter L.

Alternative: ""COVER""? But no A? Must have A.

Another: ""ASHEN""? Not C start.

We need to maximize information? But since we know E and A are in, but not where, and R similarly.

In ""CLEAR"", we test L as new letter? And put E at position 3, A at position 4, R at position 5.

In ""CARES"": we put A at position 2 (new), R at position 3 (new), E at position 4 (new), S at position 5.

Both seem useful? But ""CLEAR"" has the advantage that we shift all common letters to new positions? 

But note: originally E was at position 5, now at position 3? Similarly, A from position 3 to position 4? R from position 2 to position 5? So changing all.

Whereas in ""CARES"", A is moved to position 2? Which is different from original position 3? R to position 3 (from original 2? But original R at position 2, now at position 3? That's a shift by one? 

But ""CLEAR"" introduces L? Which might be common? But not as common as S? In word games, S is more common.

But also, we can consider another word: ""CATER""? But then E? We need E? So must have E.

Similarly, ""HAREM""? Not C start.

I think ""CARES"" or ""CLEAR"" might work, but let's think of others.

Another word: ""CRAMP""? But R at position 2? Disallowed? No: position 2 is R? Can't.

""TRACE""? Starts with T? Not C.

We must start with C.

So back to: 

Possible words: 
- ""CARES"": C A R E S. 
  Positions: 
    A at pos2 (which is different from orig.pos3)
    R at pos3 (orig was pos2? So next position? But we don't know if it helps? Might not be efficient? 
  But E at pos4? Fine.
  S at pos5.

But E was previously at position 5? Now we put E at position 4? Good test.

Similarly, ""CLEAR"": C L E A R
  E at pos3? Previously E was at pos5? 
  A at pos4? Previously A was at pos3?
  R at pos5? Previously R at pos2? So moved?

But which is better? 

Another candidate: ""EATEN""? Not C.

Perhaps ""REACT""? But starts with R? Not C.

""CHEAP""? Doesn't have R? Must have R.

So between ""CLEAR"" and ""CARES""?

We might choose one that avoids repeating letters? Both have distinct letters? ""CLEAR"": C,L,E,A,R -> distinct. 
""CARES"": C,A,R,E,S -> distinct.

Also, both test a new consonant: L or S?

In English, S is more frequent? But L is also common.

But we know the word contains E and A? So vowels are covered.

To maximize information: using common letters.

Another idea: since we know E and A are common, but already known, and we want to find the missing letter? And positions.

So introducing a letter like S might be more useful? Because plurals? But no, 5-letter word? Not necessarily plural.

But S is a very common letter.

Similarly, T is common? But we haven't tried T.

But in our first guess ""CRANE"", we had N excluded? T was not tested.

In ""CARES"": we introduce S? And in ""CLEAR"": introduce L.

Both are fine? I think ""CARES"" might be more typical? 

But note, in ""CARES"":
- If we put R at position 3? That was not the original position? But we don't know where R is? So we try one possibility.

But also, we can consider: the missing letter? In the word? For example, in the secret word, R, A, E could be sharing the other positions? So we need to assign them.

But let me try to think: position 2: can be A? And E? 
But if we put A at position 2? Then in ""CARES"", we have:
C A R E S : and position 5 is S? But we know E is not at position 5? Then if S is present? It might be? 

But what if the secret word has E at position 3? Or something? 

Perhaps better to choose a word that places some letters in positions we suspect? Actually, we have no strong constraint? 

But we might deduce: by the feedback? 

For example, since R is not at position 2, and it was in the word? So the word could have R at position 3,4 or 5? 

Similarly, E cannot be at position 5? So E at 2,3,4? 

A cannot be at position 3? So A at 2,4, or 5? 

Now, if we want to test position 5? For example, we can put R at position 5? Or A? Or a new letter? 

I think ""CLEAR"" and ""CARES"" both are valid? 

Another idea: ""CRIER""? But R at position 2? Disallowed? Position 2 is R? No.

""RAINY""? Not C.

I think ""CARES"" is a good choice? Or ""CLEAR""? 

Perhaps ""CAULE""? Not a word.

Decide: let's use ""CARES"".

But wait: ""CARES"" has C,A,R,E,S.

After first guess feedback: we know R is not at position 2? But in ""CARES"", we put R at position 3? Okay? 

Similarly, E is at position 4? Not position 5? So okay.

But note: we also have A at position 2? Is there a conflict? Feedback for the first guess: A was at position 3 and got '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. Position 2 was position for R at that time? We don't have info about A at position 2? So can put A at position 2? Yes.

Similarly, S at position 5? We don't know.

So ""CARES"" should be fine.

But let's see: if the secret word were ""CARVE"", then R is not at position 2? Actually ""CARVE"" has R at position 3. And E at position 5? But feedback for ""CRANE"" showed E not at position 5? So E cannot be at position 5? So ""CARVE"" as secret? But E at position 5? Then feedback would have shown E with 'x', not '-'? Because '-' means present but wrong position? If E were at position 5 in the secret word, then when placed at position 5? If it were correct? But in secret word ""CARVE"", E is at position 5? And our guess was ""CRANE"": position 5 E? If secret ""CARVE"", then position 5: E? Then the feedback for ""CRANE"" position 5 would be ✓? Because E is at position 5? 

But here feedback for ""CRANE"" position 5: E showed '-', meaning it is in the word but not position 5? Therefore, E cannot be at position 5? So secret word cannot have E at position 5? Thus ""CARVE"" is impossible? Because it has E at position 5? So we don't need to consider? 

Therefore, our reasoning.

So back to: we are free to choose a word with C, and having A,R,E in positions 2,3,4? Or etc? 

But in ""CARES"": 
Position 2: A -> this tells us if A is at position 2? 
Position 3: R -> tells if R at position 3? 
Position 4: E -> tells if E at position 4? 
Position 5: S -> tells if S in the word? 

Whereas ""CLEAR"":
Position 2: L -> new letter test
Position 3: E -> E at position 3?
Position 4: A -> A at position 4?
Position 5: R -> R at position 5?

Both are good? I think both can work? But let's pick ""CARES"" because S might be more common? 

But also we are in step-by-step: so I'll go with ""CARES"".

But another option: ""SCARE""? but doesn't start with C? We must start with C? Because the first position C is fixed? So position 1 must be C? So no, ""SCARE"" starts with S.

Therefore, only option like ""CARES""?

No: we have ""CLARE""? Not a common word? Often ""CLAIRE"" is 6 letters? So not.

""CEASE""? But E at position 2? And A at position 3? But feedback said A not at position 3? So we shouldn't put A at position 3? But in ""CEASE"":
C E A S E? Positions:
Position 2: E -> okay? 
Position 3: A -> disallowed? Because feedback said A is in the word but not in position 3? So if we put A at position 3, that would be incorrect? And we know it shouldn't be there? So why try? That would be a waste? 

Therefore, we should avoid putting A at position 3? Because we already know it's wrong? 

Similarly, we must not put A at position 3 in our guess? Because it would definitely not be ✓? So it is better to place it elsewhere to test.

Therefore, ""CEASE"" should not be used? Because we put A at position 3? But we know it is wrong? So we would only get a '-'? But we can still get '-'? But we know it is present? So it doesn't help? Better to put A in a new position? 

Similarly, we should avoid:
- Putting R at position 2? Definitely no.
- Putting A at position 3? Definitely no.
- Putting E at position 5? Definitely no.

So in our new guess, place R at position 3,4, or 5? But not 2.
Place A at position 2,4, or 5? But not 3.
Place E at position 2,3, or 4? But not 5.

Therefore, in our new guess:
- Position 2: not R? And can be A, E, or new letter.
- Position 3: not A? And can be R, E, or new letter.
- Position 4: can be any of R, A, E, new?
- Position 5: not E? And must be R,A, or new? Because E cannot be at 5.

But we are trying to cover R, A, E.

In ""CARES"":
Pos2: A -> used, and allowed? (A not at pos3, now at pos2? So okay)
Pos3: R -> used, and allowed? (R not at pos2, now at pos3? Okay)
Pos4: E -> used, and allowed? (E not at pos5, now at pos4? Okay)
Pos5: S -> new letter.

So perfect.

In ""CLEAR"":
Pos2: L -> new
Pos3: E -> used, allowed? (E not at pos5, now at pos3? Okay)
Pos4: A -> used, and not at pos3? Putting at pos4? Okay.
Pos5: R -> used, and not at pos2? Putting at pos5? Okay.

Also perfect.

But to decide: let's count? Or, since S is more frequent, maybe ""CARES"" might be slightly better? 

But L is also common? 

I recall that ""adieu"" might be a follow up? But not here? 

Another word: ""OATER""? Not C.

Perhaps ""CARTE"" was invalid because E at 5? But we know E not at position 5? So no.

Conclusion: either ""CARES"" or ""CLEAR"".

Let's choose ""CARES"".

But the word ""CARES"" is valid? Yes.

So guessed word: ""CARES""

Therefore, we return:We have the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": C(✓), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(-). This means:
- C is in the secret word and in position 1.
- R, A, and E are in the secret word but not in positions 2, 3, or 5 respectively.
- N is not in the secret word.

For the second guess:
- Position 1 must be C (fixed per feedback).
- R cannot be in position 2.
- A cannot be in position 3.
- E cannot be in position 5.
- The guess must include R, A, and E (since they are in the word) and one new untested letter (as N is excluded).
- Positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 should contain R, A, E, and the new letter, avoiding the disallowed assignments.

The word ""CARES"" fits these constraints:
- Starts with C.
- Positions: 
  - A at position 2 (not disallowed).
  - R at position 3 (not disallowed, as it was only forbidden in position 2).
  - E at position 4 (not disallowed, as it was only forbidden in position 5).
  - New letter S at position 5.
This allows us to test new positions for A, R, E and introduce a common new letter (S) for further elimination.

Actually, N is entirely absent, so no position can have N.\n- Position 5: Cannot be E, but E is present elsewhere.\n\nAlso, R, A, E must appear in the word, but in positions other than 2, 3, and 5 respectively.\n\nSo the word we are looking for:\n- Starts with C.\n- Contains R, A, E (and C we already have at position 1).\n- Does not contain N.\n\nMoreover, since R, A, E are not in positions 2, 3, 5, but must appear somewhere else.\n\nPossible positions for R, A, E:\n- R: cannot be in position 2, so it must be in position 3, 4, or ?\n  Actually, positions we have: 1,2,3,4,5.\n  Position 1 is C (fixed), so R must be in 3,4? Or ... wait, we have position 1 taken by C, so R can be in 3,4, or possibly 5? But position 5 was E in the guess, but E is in the word and not in position 5, so R could be in position 5? Yes.\n\nSimilarly for A: it was in position 3 in the guess, so cannot be in position 3. So it can be in position 2,4,5? But position 1 is C, so not available.\n\nSimilarly for E: it was in position 5 in the guess, so cannot be in position 5. So it can be in position 2,3,4.\n\nNow, note that we have exactly 5 letters: C, R, A, E, and one more? Because we know four letters: C, R, A, E are in, but the word has 5 letters. So there is one more letter.\n\nWe also know N is out.\n\nSo the word must be: C ? ? ? ? \nwith letters including R, A, E and one more letter.\n\nWe need to form a word that starts with C, and contains R, A, E.\n\nWe also know the positions that are disallowed for some letters.\n\nLet me think of words that start with C and have R, A, E.\n\nFor example: ""CRATE"", ""CRANE"" but we tried crane and N is out, so no. ""CRATE"" has T instead of N.\n\nBut let\'s check the positions:\n\nIn ""CRATE"":\n- C is position 1 -> correct.\n- R is position 2 -> but feedback said R is not in position 2? Yes, because R got a \'-\', meaning it\'s not in position 2. So if we guess ""CRATE"", R would be in position 2, which is forbidden.\n\nTherefore, ""CRATE"" is invalid because R should not be in position 2.\n\nOther words: ""CARTE""? But E is at position 5? But feedback says E cannot be in position 5? Actually, in feedback E got \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in position 5. So if we put E at position 5, that would be wrong.\n\nIn ""CARTE"":\n- Position 1: C (good)\n- Position 2: A -> but originally A was in position 3 and got \'-\', so it must not be in position 3? But position 2 might be okay? We don\'t know yet.\n\nWe have to avoid:\n- R in position 2 (from feedback)\n- A in position 3 (from feedback)\n- E in position 5 (from feedback)\n\nSo in our next guess, we should avoid these positions for those letters.\n\nMoreover, we have one more letter to find.\n\nLet me list possible words: ""C"" words that contain R, A, E.\n\nPossible: ""CAUSE"", but that has U and S? And does not have R? We must have R.\n\nWe know the word must contain R, A, E (and C).\n\nSo letters: C, R, A, E, and one unknown.\n\nWe also know N is not in the word.\n\nLooking for words: \n- Starting with C\n- Having R, A, E\n\nFor example: ""CRANE"" we tried -> ruled out by N and feedback.\n""CRATE"" -> R at position 2, which is bad (R is not at position 2).\n\n""CARVE"" -> but V might be? \nBut check positions: \nIn ""CARVE"": \n- C at 1: good.\n- A at 2: okay? Feedback didn\'t say anything about A at position 2? Actually, in feedback A was in position 3 and got \'-\' meaning A is not in position 3, but position 2 might be okay.\n- R at 3: originally R was at position 2 and got \'-\', meaning R is not at position 2, but position 3 could be? \nBut we don\'t know if R can be at position 3? We only know it\'s not at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, V is a new letter.\n\nE is at position 5: but feedback said E is not at position 5? So we cannot have E at position 5. So ""CARVE"" would have E at position 5 -> bad.\n\nSimilarly, ""CARE"" is 4 letters, too short.\n\nAnother word: ""CREAM"". But ""CREAM"" has 5 letters: C,R,E,A,M. \nNow, positions:\n- C at 1: good.\n- R at 2: but R was at position 2 in the first guess and got a \'-\' meaning it\'s not in position 2? So same as ""CRATE"", R at position 2 is bad.\n\nSo we must choose a word where:\n- R is not at position 2.\n- A is not at position 3.\n- E is not at position 5.\n\nAnd the word must start with C.\n\nWe also need to include R, A, E, and one more letter (not N).\n\nWe have used C in position 1, so we need to assign R, A, E to positions 2,3,4,5? But we can\'t assign them to their disallowed positions.\n\nSo:\n- Position 2: cannot be R? Actually, from feedback: R is not in position 2. But can other letters be there? Yes.\n  For position 2, we cannot put R, but we can put A or E? Or the new letter? Actually, A and E can be in position 2? Yes, because A was placed at position 3 and got wrong, so it might be at 2? Similarly E.\n\nBut E was at position 5 and got wrong, so E can be at position 2? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, A can be at position 2? Yes.\n\nSo for position 2: we can put A, E, or a new letter? But we must use all of R, A, E? So we have to fit them in.\n\nLet\'s list possible positions for each:\n\nR: cannot be position 2 -> possible positions: 3 or 4 or ...? Only positions 3,4? Because position 5: we don\'t have information yet? But position 1 is taken by C, so R can be in 3,4,5? But position 5 might be possible? However, we know R must be in one of 3,4,5? Or 2nd, but 2nd is disallowed.\n\nSimilarly, A: cannot be position 3 -> possible positions: 2,4,5? \nE: cannot be position 5 -> possible positions: 2,3,4.\n\nNow, we need to assign each of R, A, E to distinct positions from {2,3,4,5}, avoiding their disallowed positions.\n\nBut note: we have an additional letter, say X, which we don\'t know.\n\nSo the word: [C, ?, ?, ?, ?] where the ? are R,A,E and X in some order.\n\nWe have 4 positions: 2,3,4,5, and 4 letters: R, A, E, X.\n\nBut we need to assign R, A, E avoiding their disallowed positions, and X can go anywhere.\n\nSince we have only one X, we can think of words that fit.\n\nTry to fix the positions we can.\n\nFor example, E can be in positions: 2,3,4.\nA can be in positions: 2,4,5? Wait, position 5? Previously feedback said E is not in position 5, but for A? Position 5 is okay for A? Because A was not present at position 5 in the first guess? Actually, we don\'t know about A at position 5? It might be okay.\n\nSimilarly, R can be in positions: 3,4,5? \n\nNow, to get more information, we might want to guess a word that tests these possibilities and covers new letters.\n\nAlso, we want to avoid using letters that we already know are not present, but so far we only know N is absent? And we haven\'t used any other.\n\nTherefore, for the next guess, we should:\n- Keep C at position 1 (since it\'s fixed).\n- Assign R, A, E to positions that are not their disallowed ones, and introduce one new letter.\n\nBut note, we cannot assign R to position 2? That\'s fixed by feedback? Actually, feedback says R is in the word but not at position 2, so we must place R elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly, avoid A at position 3 and E at position 5.\n\nPossible word?\n\nLet me try to put:\n- Position 2: E (since it can go there, and this tests E in a new position).\n- But E was in position 5 originally, now we put at position 2.\n\nBut we have to assign R and A as well.\n\nFor example, ""C"" + ""E"" at position 2? Then what.\n\nWord: create? But ""CREATE"" is 6 letters? Too long.\n\n5-letter words: \n\nHow about ""CLEAR""? But ""CLEAR"": C, L, E, A, R. \nBut L is a new letter.\n\nCheck positions:\n- Position 2: L? That\'s new -> okay? \nBut we haven\'t placed R, A, E? In ""CLEAR"":\n  Position 1: C (good)\n  Position 2: L (new)\n  Position 3: E -> but E was disallowed at position 5? But position 3 is new for E? Actually we can try E at position 3? Yes.\n  Position 4: A -> but A was disallowed at position 3? Position 4 is okay? Yes.\n  Position 5: R -> but R was disallowed at position 2? Position 5 is okay? Yes? Because feedback didn\'t say anything about position 5 for R? Only that R is not at position 2.\n\nAlso, note that E is at position 3: which is not position 5? So okay? But we don\'t know if E can be at position 3? We can test.\n\nBut we are putting E at position 3, A at position 4, R at position 5.\n\nAre we required to have them all? Yes, so ""CLEAR"" has C, L, E, A, R -> L is new.\n\nBut does it include E, A, R? Yes: E at 3, A at 4, R at 5.\n\nNow, check disallowed positions:\n- A: feedback said A is not at position 3? We put A at position 4 -> okay.\n- E: feedback said E is not at position 5? We put E at position 3 -> okay.\n- R: feedback said R is not at position 2? We put R at position 5 -> okay.\n\nSo ""CLEAR"" seems fulfilling.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had C at position 1 and it was correct, so we keep that.\n\nAnother possibility: ""CRUEL""? \n""C"" + R at position 2? But R cannot be at position 2? So no, we cannot put R at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""CANAL"" has N? N is out. Also, doesn\'t have R? And we must have R.\n\nAnother word: ""CAUSE"" again: doesn\'t have R? Must have R.\n\nSo ""CLEAR"" seems like a valid guess.\n\nBut let\'s think: we have C, and then L, E, A, R.\n\nThe new letter introduced is L.\n\nWe might be able to use our knowledge: we haven\'t tested vowels? But we already have A and E.\n\nAnother word: ""CREAK""? \nBut in ""CREAK"": \n- Position 2: R -> disallowed! (R cannot be at position 2)\nSo that\'s invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""CRYPT""? But doesn\'t have A or E? We know the word contains A and E? Yes, from feedback.\n\nSimilarly, ""BARGE""? But doesn\'t start with C? We start with C.\n\nSo ""CLEAR"" is a good candidate.\n\nWe could do ""CARES""? But that has S? And E at position 5? Disallowed? Because E cannot be at position 5? So putting E at position 5 would be bad.\n\nIn ""CARES"": \n- Position 1: C\n- Position 2: A -> might be okay? \n- Position 3: R -> wait, R was disallowed at position 2? Position 3 might be? Actually, we don\'t know for position 3? But A is at position 2? That\'s okay? \n- Position 4: E? Why not? \n- Position 5: S? \nBut E is not at position 5? It\'s at position 4? Then position 5 is S? \nSo E is at position 4? Then okay? \n\nBut then R is at position 3? Which is okay? \n\nBut how would ""CARES"" be spelled? C-A-R-E-S.\n\nSo: \nPosition 1: C (good)\nPosition 2: A: originally A was at position 3 with \'-\' meaning not at 3? Position 2: we don\'t know? So can put A at 2? \nPosition 3: R? But feedback for R: R was given at position 2 and got \'-\', meaning not at 2? Position 3: may be allowed? \nPosition 4: E: which is not position 5? Okay.\nPosition 5: S.\n\nSo that passes the constraints? \n\nHowever, note we must have all letters: R, A, E and C? In ""CARES"", we have R, A, E? Yes: R at position 3, A at position 2, E at position 4, and C at position 1, S at position 5? So S is the extra letter.\n\nBut we don\'t know about S? It might be fine.\n\nBut let\'s compare: ""CLEAR"" and ""CARES""?\n\nBoth valid? But in ""CARES"":\n- A is at position 2: which was not tested before? Similarly, in ""CLEAR"": new letter L.\n\nAlternative: ""COVER""? But no A? Must have A.\n\nAnother: ""ASHEN""? Not C start.\n\nWe need to maximize information? But since we know E and A are in, but not where, and R similarly.\n\nIn ""CLEAR"", we test L as new letter? And put E at position 3, A at position 4, R at position 5.\n\nIn ""CARES"": we put A at position 2 (new), R at position 3 (new), E at position 4 (new), S at position 5.\n\nBoth seem useful? But ""CLEAR"" has the advantage that we shift all common letters to new positions? \n\nBut note: originally E was at position 5, now at position 3? Similarly, A from position 3 to position 4? R from position 2 to position 5? So changing all.\n\nWhereas in ""CARES"", A is moved to position 2? Which is different from original position 3? R to position 3 (from original 2? But original R at position 2, now at position 3? That\'s a shift by one? \n\nBut ""CLEAR"" introduces L? Which might be common? But not as common as S? In word games, S is more common.\n\nBut also, we can consider another word: ""CATER""? But then E? We need E? So must have E.\n\nSimilarly, ""HAREM""? Not C start.\n\nI think ""CARES"" or ""CLEAR"" might work, but let\'s think of others.\n\nAnother word: ""CRAMP""? But R at position 2? Disallowed? No: position 2 is R? Can\'t.\n\n""TRACE""? Starts with T? Not C.\n\nWe must start with C.\n\nSo back to: \n\nPossible words: \n- ""CARES"": C A R E S. \n  Positions: \n    A at pos2 (which is different from orig.pos3)\n    R at pos3 (orig was pos2? So next position? But we don\'t know if it helps? Might not be efficient? \n  But E at pos4? Fine.\n  S at pos5.\n\nBut E was previously at position 5? Now we put E at position 4? Good test.\n\nSimilarly, ""CLEAR"": C L E A R\n  E at pos3? Previously E was at pos5? \n  A at pos4? Previously A was at pos3?\n  R at pos5? Previously R at pos2? So moved?\n\nBut which is better? \n\nAnother candidate: ""EATEN""? Not C.\n\nPerhaps ""REACT""? But starts with R? Not C.\n\n""CHEAP""? Doesn\'t have R? Must have R.\n\nSo between ""CLEAR"" and ""CARES""?\n\nWe might choose one that avoids repeating letters? Both have distinct letters? ""CLEAR"": C,L,E,A,R -> distinct. \n""CARES"": C,A,R,E,S -> distinct.\n\nAlso, both test a new consonant: L or S?\n\nIn English, S is more frequent? But L is also common.\n\nBut we know the word contains E and A? So vowels are covered.\n\nTo maximize information: using common letters.\n\nAnother idea: since we know E and A are common, but already known, and we want to find the missing letter? And positions.\n\nSo introducing a letter like S might be more useful? Because plurals? But no, 5-letter word? Not necessarily plural.\n\nBut S is a very common letter.\n\nSimilarly, T is common? But we haven\'t tried T.\n\nBut in our first guess ""CRANE"", we had N excluded? T was not tested.\n\nIn ""CARES"": we introduce S? And in ""CLEAR"": introduce L.\n\nBoth are fine? I think ""CARES"" might be more typical? \n\nBut note, in ""CARES"":\n- If we put R at position 3? That was not the original position? But we don\'t know where R is? So we try one possibility.\n\nBut also, we can consider: the missing letter? In the word? For example, in the secret word, R, A, E could be sharing the other positions? So we need to assign them.\n\nBut let me try to think: position 2: can be A? And E? \nBut if we put A at position 2? Then in ""CARES"", we have:\nC A R E S : and position 5 is S? But we know E is not at position 5? Then if S is present? It might be? \n\nBut what if the secret word has E at position 3? Or something? \n\nPerhaps better to choose a word that places some letters in positions we suspect? Actually, we have no strong constraint? \n\nBut we might deduce: by the feedback? \n\nFor example, since R is not at position 2, and it was in the word? So the word could have R at position 3,4 or 5? \n\nSimilarly, E cannot be at position 5? So E at 2,3,4? \n\nA cannot be at position 3? So A at 2,4, or 5? \n\nNow, if we want to test position 5? For example, we can put R at position 5? Or A? Or a new letter? \n\nI think ""CLEAR"" and ""CARES"" both are valid? \n\nAnother idea: ""CRIER""? But R at position 2? Disallowed? Position 2 is R? No.\n\n""RAINY""? Not C.\n\nI think ""CARES"" is a good choice? Or ""CLEAR""? \n\nPerhaps ""CAULE""? Not a word.\n\nDecide: let\'s use ""CARES"".\n\nBut wait: ""CARES"" has C,A,R,E,S.\n\nAfter first guess feedback: we know R is not at position 2? But in ""CARES"", we put R at position 3? Okay? \n\nSimilarly, E is at position 4? Not position 5? So okay.\n\nBut note: we also have A at position 2? Is there a conflict? Feedback for the first guess: A was at position 3 and got \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. Position 2 was position for R at that time? We don\'t have info about A at position 2? So can put A at position 2? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, S at position 5? We don\'t know.\n\nSo ""CARES"" should be fine.\n\nBut let\'s see: if the secret word were ""CARVE"", then R is not at position 2? Actually ""CARVE"" has R at position 3. And E at position 5? But feedback for ""CRANE"" showed E not at position 5? So E cannot be at position 5? So ""CARVE"" as secret? But E at position 5? Then feedback would have shown E with \'x\', not \'-\'? Because \'-\' means present but wrong position? If E were at position 5 in the secret word, then when placed at position 5? If it were correct? But in secret word ""CARVE"", E is at position 5? And our guess was ""CRANE"": position 5 E? If secret ""CARVE"", then position 5: E? Then the feedback for ""CRANE"" position 5 would be ✓? Because E is at position 5? \n\nBut here feedback for ""CRANE"" position 5: E showed \'-\', meaning it is in the word but not position 5? Therefore, E cannot be at position 5? So secret word cannot have E at position 5? Thus ""CARVE"" is impossible? Because it has E at position 5? So we don\'t need to consider? \n\nTherefore, our reasoning.\n\nSo back to: we are free to choose a word with C, and having A,R,E in positions 2,3,4? Or etc? \n\nBut in ""CARES"": \nPosition 2: A -> this tells us if A is at position 2? \nPosition 3: R -> tells if R at position 3? \nPosition 4: E -> tells if E at position 4? \nPosition 5: S -> tells if S in the word? \n\nWhereas ""CLEAR"":\nPosition 2: L -> new letter test\nPosition 3: E -> E at position 3?\nPosition 4: A -> A at position 4?\nPosition 5: R -> R at position 5?\n\nBoth are good? I think both can work? But let\'s pick ""CARES"" because S might be more common? \n\nBut also we are in step-by-step: so I\'ll go with ""CARES"".\n\nBut another option: ""SCARE""? but doesn\'t start with C? We must start with C? Because the first position C is fixed? So position 1 must be C? So no, ""SCARE"" starts with S.\n\nTherefore, only option like ""CARES""?\n\nNo: we have ""CLARE""? Not a common word? Often ""CLAIRE"" is 6 letters? So not.\n\n""CEASE""? But E at position 2? And A at position 3? But feedback said A not at position 3? So we shouldn\'t put A at position 3? But in ""CEASE"":\nC E A S E? Positions:\nPosition 2: E -> okay? \nPosition 3: A -> disallowed? Because feedback said A is in the word but not in position 3? So if we put A at position 3, that would be incorrect? And we know it shouldn\'t be there? So why try? That would be a waste? \n\nTherefore, we should avoid putting A at position 3? Because we already know it\'s wrong? \n\nSimilarly, we must not put A at position 3 in our guess? Because it would definitely not be ✓? So it is better to place it elsewhere to test.\n\nTherefore, ""CEASE"" should not be used? Because we put A at position 3? But we know it is wrong? So we would only get a \'-\'? But we can still get \'-\'? But we know it is present? So it doesn\'t help? Better to put A in a new position? \n\nSimilarly, we should avoid:\n- Putting R at position 2? Definitely no.\n- Putting A at position 3? Definitely no.\n- Putting E at position 5? Definitely no.\n\nSo in our new guess, place R at position 3,4, or 5? But not 2.\nPlace A at position 2,4, or 5? But not 3.\nPlace E at position 2,3, or 4? But not 5.\n\nTherefore, in our new guess:\n- Position 2: not R? And can be A, E, or new letter.\n- Position 3: not A? And can be R, E, or new letter.\n- Position 4: can be any of R, A, E, new?\n- Position 5: not E? And must be R,A, or new? Because E cannot be at 5.\n\nBut we are trying to cover R, A, E.\n\nIn ""CARES"":\nPos2: A -> used, and allowed? (A not at pos3, now at pos2? So okay)\nPos3: R -> used, and allowed? (R not at pos2, now at pos3? Okay)\nPos4: E -> used, and allowed? (E not at pos5, now at pos4? Okay)\nPos5: S -> new letter.\n\nSo perfect.\n\nIn ""CLEAR"":\nPos2: L -> new\nPos3: E -> used, allowed? (E not at pos5, now at pos3? Okay)\nPos4: A -> used, and not at pos3? Putting at pos4? Okay.\nPos5: R -> used, and not at pos2? Putting at pos5? Okay.\n\nAlso perfect.\n\nBut to decide: let\'s count? Or, since S is more frequent, maybe ""CARES"" might be slightly better? \n\nBut L is also common? \n\nI recall that ""adieu"" might be a follow up? But not here? \n\nAnother word: ""OATER""? Not C.\n\nPerhaps ""CARTE"" was invalid because E at 5? But we know E not at position 5? So no.\n\nConclusion: either ""CARES"" or ""CLEAR"".\n\nLet\'s choose ""CARES"".\n\nBut the word ""CARES"" is valid? Yes.\n\nSo guessed word: ""CARES""\n\nTherefore, we return:We have the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": C(✓), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(-). This means:\n- C is in the secret word and in position 1.\n- R, A, and E are in the secret word but not in positions 2, 3, or 5 respectively.\n- N is not in the secret word.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Position 1 must be C (fixed per feedback).\n- R cannot be in position 2.\n- A cannot be in position 3.\n- E cannot be in position 5.\n- The guess must include R, A, and E (since they are in the word) and one new untested letter (as N is excluded).\n- Positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 should contain R, A, E, and the new letter, avoiding the disallowed assignments.\n\nThe word ""CARES"" fits these constraints:\n- Starts with C.\n- Positions: \n  - A at position 2 (not disallowed).\n  - R at position 3 (not disallowed, as it was only forbidden in position 2).\n  - E at position 4 (not disallowed, as it was only forbidden in position 5).\n  - New letter S at position 5.\nThis allows us to test new positions for A, R, E and introduce a common new letter (S) for further elimination.\n\n<guess>cares</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: cares -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) S(x)\n'}]","<think>

- Position 2: A is correct => Secret word has A in position 2.
- Position 3: R is in the word but wrong position (since we got (-)).

    Position 5: S(x)

  So now positions 1,2,4 are known: 
    P1: C
    P2: A
    P4: E

- The word is C A ? E ? 
  With the two missing letters: one at position 3 and one at position 5.

Additionally, the letters known to be in the word:
- From guess1: R is in the word. Also E is in (but we now fixed at position 4). And A is in (fixed at position 2).
- From Guess2: R is still present (because R got (-) in position 3) and now we know it must be in the secret word but not at position 3.

So R is in the word, but cannot be at position 3? Since we placed it at position 3 and got (-).

Also, we know:
- N is not in the word? From first guess.
- S is not in the word? From second guess.

Moreover, E was previously at position 5 and got (-) in guess1, but now we have it fixed at position 4? Why was it (-) in position 5? Because at that time we didn't know position 4 was E? So now we see that E is at position 4, not at position 5? Therefore, position 5 is not E? And S is not at position 5? So position 5 must be a different letter? 

Now, R must be in the word but not at position 3 (from guess2). Since positions 1 and 2 are fixed? Position 1: C, position 2: A? So R cannot be at position 3? And cannot be at position 4 (since position 4 is E)? Therefore, R must be at position 5? Because that's the only other position? Or? 

The word has letters: positions 1: C, 2: A, 3: ?, 4: E, 5: ?

We know R is present? And R must appear? But in position 5? Or perhaps duplicated? But we don't know.

Also, from guess1: R was at position 2 and got (-)? Then we put A at position 2 and got ✓? So R must be somewhere else? And similarly, E was at position 5? Got (-)? Because now it is at position 4? So the (-) for E in guess1 makes sense.

Similarly, A was at position 3 in guess1 and got (-)? Because now we know it is at position 2? So in the secret word, A is at position 2? So when placed at position 3, it was wrong? So (-).

Now, for R: we know it is in the word? And cannot be at position 1 (C), position 2 (A), position 3? Why? Because we put it at position 3 in guess2 and got (-)? Meaning it is present but wrong position? So R cannot be at position 3? And also, cannot be at position 4? Because position 4 now has E? And we know E is fixed? 

So R must be at position 5? Because position 1,2,4 are fixed? Position 5 is the only one left? Or position 3? But position 3 can't be R? Because we have (-) for R at position 3? Meaning it is present but wrong position? That implies it cannot be at position 3? So must be at position 5.

Therefore, position 5 must be R? 

But let's confirm: 

In guess2: we put R at position 3? And the feedback is (-) for that? Meaning that R is in the secret word? But not at position 3? 

Now, the available positions: 
Position 1: C
Position 2: A
Position 3: unknown? 
Position 4: E
Position 5: unknown? 

And R must be one of the missing positions? But we already have letters? 

Also, the secret word has 5 letters: 
- We have C, A, E at positions 1,2,4? 
- And R must be present? But where? Only positions 3 and 5? But position 3 cannot be R? So R must be at position 5? Then what is at position 3? 

But position 3 is not R? So that must be a different letter? 

Also, we know R is at position 5? Then position 3 must be another letter? 

But we also must consider? Earlier from guess1, we know there is E and A? But they are fixed? 

So the secret word has:
Position 1: C
Position 2: A
Position 3: ? (some letter, not R and not S or N? etc.)
Position 4: E
Position 5: R (we deduced)

But we must check if that fits all feedback.

Check with guess2: 
- Position 3: R? But we put R and got (-)? But if secret position 5 is R, but we put R at position 3? Then R is in the word but wrong position? So it would be (-)? Correct? 

Now, what about position 5? We put S at position 5? And S(x)? Meaning not in the word? So S was not present? 

Therefore, the secret word must be: C A ? E R 

Where the missing letter at position 3 is an unknown letter? 

But we know that from guess1? Also, the letter at position 3? 

We know the secret word consists of C, A, ?, E, R? And the missing letter? 

Also, we know from first guess: 
Letters known from guess1: C, R, A, E were in? And N was not? But E and A are fixed? C and R we have? So the word must have five distinct letters? Or not? 

But we don't know? 

For example, could there be repeated letters? Possibly? But in this case, since at position 3 we have an unknown? 

Moreover, R is now at position 5? 

Now, we must choose a word that fits: C A ? E R 

And we need to guess? 

But we have only one missing letter? So we can list possible letters? But we know N and S are out? 

Also, from the feedback? Also, in first guess: A was at position 3? And got (-)? Then what should be at position 3? 

But now we have to guess? 

In fact, the word might be ""CAPER""? Or ""CAMER""? But ""CAMER"" maybe not word? 

Common words: 
- ""CAKER""? Not common? 
- ""CAPER"": C A P E R -> so position 3: P.

But is P a candidate? 

Also, ""CAVER"": C A V E R? 
But V? 

But we need to form a word.

Moreover, from first guess: We had ""CRANE"": with R at position 2 and A at position 3? and got A(-) meaning A was at wrong position? But we now have A at position 2? Correct? 

Similarly, with our candidate ""CAPER"": 
If secret were ""CAPER"", then in guess2: we guessed ""CARES"": 
- C: ✓ 
- A: ✓ 
- R: ? we put at position 3? But in secret, R is at position 5? So must have (-) for R? 
- E: ✓? Position 4? 
- S: not in? So (x) is correct? 

Then it matches? 

But how would the missing letter be found? 

Therefore, we only need to figure out the letter at position 3? 

Possible words: 
5-letter words starting with C, second letter A, fourth letter E, fifth letter R: 
Examples: ""CAPER"", ""CAVER"", ""CAGER"", ""CAMER"" (not common?), ""CAWER"" (not?), ""BAKER"" not C.

Also: ""SABER"" not C start? 

Common ones: ""CAPER"": a word? Yes, meaning a joyful activity or one who capes? 

Also ""CADRE"": C A D R E? But wait: position 4 should be E? But in ""CADRE"": D is at position 3? R at position 4? Then E at position 5? But we need position 4: E? So ""CADRE"" has position 4: R? So doesn't work? Unless mistaken.

""CADRE"": 
Position 1: C 
Position 2: A 
Position 3: D 
Position 4: R 
Position 5: E

But our requirement: position 4 must be E? That's not matched? 

We need position 4: E? So ""CADRE"" doesn't fit? 

Similarly, ""CAVER"": C A V E R? Positions: 
1: C 
2: A 
3: V 
4: E 
5: R 

Yes? This fits: C A V E R? 

Similarly, ""CAPER"": C A P E R? 

And ""CABER"": C A B E R? 

Also ""CAMBER"": too long? 

So possible words: CAPER, CAVER, CABER, maybe others: like ""CANER"" but N was excluded? N is not in? So CANER cannot because N is out? 

Similarly, CAKER? Not a word? 

CAGER? Cager? Meaning one in a cage? Possible? But rare? 

But CAPER, CABER, CAVER are common? 

But CABER: a pole thrown in Scottish games? 

Now, how to distinguish? We need to guess? 

But note, we haven't tested the consonants P, V, B? 

Since we know the pattern: only position 3 varies? 

We need to guess a word that fits? 

But our goal is to guess the secret? So we can guess one of them? 

But also, we can think: from the first guess? 

In first guess: ""CRANE"": we had letters: C, R, A, N, E? And we now know: 
Position 1: C? Correct? 
Position 2: R? But it was wrong? Secret has A? 
Position 3: A? But secret has ????
Position 4: N? Not present? 
Position 5: E? But we now know E is at position 4? 

Also, the letter at position 3? 

For example, if the secret were ""CAPER"": then in first guess ""CRANE"": 
Position 1: C? Correct? 
Position 2: R? But secret position 2 is A? So R is present? But wrong position? So (-) 
Position 3: A? But secret position 3 is P? So A is present? Secret has A at position 2? So A at position 3? Wrong position? (-) 
Position 4: N? Not present? (x) 
Position 5: E? But secret position 4 is E? So E at position 5? Wrong position? (-) because E is actually at position 4? 

But wait: secret ""CAPER"" has E at position 4? So the secret letter at position 5 is R? And E at position 4? 

Therefore, E is at position 4? So placing E at position 5: it is present? But at wrong position? So (-) 

Similarly, if secret ""CABER"": same pattern? 

Now, we have multiple possibilities? But we have exhausted? We have to guess? 

In this response, we are to make a new 5-letter word guess? So we might choose ""CAPER""? But could be wrong? 

To ensure? We could choose a word that tests multiple possibilities? But now we are at guess 3? And have a high certainty? 

Since position 1,2,4 are known? And R must be at position 5? Therefore, the secret word is C A ? E R? And we need to guess that? 

We can try ""CAPER"" as the guess? 

But also, note that from the feedback, we have no information on the middle letter? So we must choose? 

Common options: ""CAPER"", ""CABER"", ""CAVER"" 

But which is more common? 

Perhaps we can select one? 

But we have to make a guess? 

Also, we can consider that in the first guess? We had C,R,A,N,E? And excluded N? 

Now, for position 3: the letter must not be C,A,E,R? Because we already have fixed? Unless duplicated? But unlikely? 

In fact, CAPER, CABER, CAVER? All have distinct? 

So we'll guess ""CAPER"" as it's a fairly common word? 

But let's see? Perhaps we can be smarter? 

We might choose a word that uses a common letter? But perhaps not necessary? 

So guess ""CAPER""

Therefore, return

But note: we are at guess 3? And we have at most 6 guesses? So we can try.

But also, we can think: we might get it right? 

So the next guess: ""CAPER""

And we hope? 

Therefore, response: 
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: CRANE → C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)**  
  - C is in position 1.
  - R, A, E are in the word but not in positions 2, 3, or 5.
  - N is not in the word.

- **Guess 2: CARES → C(✓) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) S(x)**  
  - C, A, E are now confirmed in positions 1, 2, and 4.
  - R is in the word but not in position 3.
  - S is not in the word.

### Deductions:
1. The secret word starts with ""C"", has ""A"" in position 2, and ""E"" in position 4: **C A ? E ?**.
2. R must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (position 1 is C, position 2 is A, and position 3 gave R(-) in Guess 2). The only remaining position for R is 5.
3. Therefore, position 5 must be R: **C A ? E R**.
4. Position 3 must be an unknown letter (not N or S, per previous feedback).
5. Possible words fitting this pattern include CAPER, CABER, or CAVER. For the next guess, CAPER is a common word that tests the position 3 pattern.

<guess>caper</guess>
</think>
<guess>caper</guess>",caper,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
And the second guess ""CARES"": C(✓) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) S(x)

What we know from the feedback:

From Guess 1 (""CRANE""):
- Position 1: C is correct => Secret word starts with C.
- Position 2: R is in the word but wrong position.
- Position 3: A is in the word but wrong position.
- Position 4: N is not in the word.
- Position 5: E is in the word but wrong position.

From Guess 2 (""CARES""):
- Position 1: C is correct (as expected) => Still C in position 1.
- Position 2: A is correct => Secret word has A in position 2.
- Position 3: R is in the word but wrong position (since we got (-)).
- Position 4: E is correct => Secret word has E in position 4.
- Position 5: S is not in the word.

Summary:
- Secret word format: C A ? E ? 
  Because positions 1,2,4 are fixed: C, A, E respectively? Wait: position 1: C, position 2: A (from second guess: A at position 2 is ✓), position 4: E (from second guess: E at position 4 is ✓)? 
  From second guess: 
    Position 1: C(✓) 
    Position 2: A(✓) 
    Position 3: R(-) 
    Position 4: E(✓) 
    Position 5: S(x)

  So now positions 1,2,4 are known: 
    P1: C
    P2: A
    P4: E

- The word is C A ? E ? 
  With the two missing letters: one at position 3 and one at position 5.

Additionally, the letters known to be in the word:
- From guess1: R is in the word. Also E is in (but we now fixed at position 4). And A is in (fixed at position 2).
- From Guess2: R is still present (because R got (-) in position 3) and now we know it must be in the secret word but not at position 3.

So R is in the word, but cannot be at position 3? Since we placed it at position 3 and got (-).

Also, we know:
- N is not in the word? From first guess.
- S is not in the word? From second guess.

Moreover, E was previously at position 5 and got (-) in guess1, but now we have it fixed at position 4? Why was it (-) in position 5? Because at that time we didn't know position 4 was E? So now we see that E is at position 4, not at position 5? Therefore, position 5 is not E? And S is not at position 5? So position 5 must be a different letter? 

Now, R must be in the word but not at position 3 (from guess2). Since positions 1 and 2 are fixed? Position 1: C, position 2: A? So R cannot be at position 3? And cannot be at position 4 (since position 4 is E)? Therefore, R must be at position 5? Because that's the only other position? Or? 

The word has letters: positions 1: C, 2: A, 3: ?, 4: E, 5: ?

We know R is present? And R must appear? But in position 5? Or perhaps duplicated? But we don't know.

Also, from guess1: R was at position 2 and got (-)? Then we put A at position 2 and got ✓? So R must be somewhere else? And similarly, E was at position 5? Got (-)? Because now it is at position 4? So the (-) for E in guess1 makes sense.

Similarly, A was at position 3 in guess1 and got (-)? Because now we know it is at position 2? So in the secret word, A is at position 2? So when placed at position 3, it was wrong? So (-).

Now, for R: we know it is in the word? And cannot be at position 1 (C), position 2 (A), position 3? Why? Because we put it at position 3 in guess2 and got (-)? Meaning it is present but wrong position? So R cannot be at position 3? And also, cannot be at position 4? Because position 4 now has E? And we know E is fixed? 

So R must be at position 5? Because position 1,2,4 are fixed? Position 5 is the only one left? Or position 3? But position 3 can't be R? Because we have (-) for R at position 3? Meaning it is present but wrong position? That implies it cannot be at position 3? So must be at position 5.

Therefore, position 5 must be R? 

But let's confirm: 

In guess2: we put R at position 3? And the feedback is (-) for that? Meaning that R is in the secret word? But not at position 3? 

Now, the available positions: 
Position 1: C
Position 2: A
Position 3: unknown? 
Position 4: E
Position 5: unknown? 

And R must be one of the missing positions? But we already have letters? 

Also, the secret word has 5 letters: 
- We have C, A, E at positions 1,2,4? 
- And R must be present? But where? Only positions 3 and 5? But position 3 cannot be R? So R must be at position 5? Then what is at position 3? 

But position 3 is not R? So that must be a different letter? 

Also, we know R is at position 5? Then position 3 must be another letter? 

But we also must consider? Earlier from guess1, we know there is E and A? But they are fixed? 

So the secret word has:
Position 1: C
Position 2: A
Position 3: ? (some letter, not R and not S or N? etc.)
Position 4: E
Position 5: R (we deduced)

But we must check if that fits all feedback.

Check with guess2: 
- Position 3: R? But we put R and got (-)? But if secret position 5 is R, but we put R at position 3? Then R is in the word but wrong position? So it would be (-)? Correct? 

Now, what about position 5? We put S at position 5? And S(x)? Meaning not in the word? So S was not present? 

Therefore, the secret word must be: C A ? E R 

Where the missing letter at position 3 is an unknown letter? 

But we know that from guess1? Also, the letter at position 3? 

We know the secret word consists of C, A, ?, E, R? And the missing letter? 

Also, we know from first guess: 
Letters known from guess1: C, R, A, E were in? And N was not? But E and A are fixed? C and R we have? So the word must have five distinct letters? Or not?

Also, from the feedback? Also, in first guess: A was at position 3? And got (-)? Then what should be at position 3? 

But now we have to guess? 

In fact, the word might be ""CAPER""? Or ""CAMER""? But ""CAMER"" maybe not word? 

Common words: 
- ""CAKER""? Not common? 
- ""CAPER"": C A P E R -> so position 3: P.

But is P a candidate? 

Also, ""CAVER"": C A V E R? 
But V? 

But we need to form a word.

Moreover, from first guess: We had ""CRANE"": with R at position 2 and A at position 3? and got A(-) meaning A was at wrong position? But we now have A at position 2? Correct? 

Similarly, with our candidate ""CAPER"":

Then it matches?

""CADRE"": 
Position 1: C 
Position 2: A 
Position 3: D 
Position 4: R 
Position 5: E

But our requirement: position 4 must be E? That's not matched? 

We need position 4: E? So ""CADRE"" doesn't fit? 

Similarly, ""CAVER"": C A V E R? Positions: 
1: C 
2: A 
3: V 
4: E 
5: R 

Yes? This fits: C A V E R? 

Similarly, ""CAPER"": C A P E R? 

And ""CABER"": C A B E R? 

Also ""CAMBER"": too long?
