We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

First, I have the feedback from Guess 1: CRANE → C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)

This means:
- R is in the secret word and it's in the correct position (position 2).
- C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has R as the second letter, and it does not contain C, A, N, or E.

Since R is in position 2, the word looks like: _ R _ _ _

Now, I need to make a second guess. I should choose a word that:
1. Has R in the second position again, to confirm or get more clues.
2. Avoids the letters C, A, N, E since they're not in the word.
3. Includes other common vowels or consonants to test for presence.

Common vowels left are: O, I, U (since A and E are out). But E is out, so vowels to try could be O, I, U.

Consonants: Avoid C, N; common ones like S, T, L, etc. might be good.

Since A and E are not in the word, the word might have different vowels, like O, I, U, or even Y.

Possible letters to include in the guess: S, T, L, O, I, U, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, etc.

I should aim for a word with R in the second position and new letters to test.

A good strategy is to test more vowels or frequent consonants.

Let me think of some words that start with a consonant, have R second, and end with something.

Common words: Words like BRIX? No, not common; better to use real words.

Examples:
- TRYST: But that has E? No, TRYST is T-R-Y-S-T. Positions: T? R? Y? S? T.

But I need R in second position.

So, let's list words that have the second letter as R.

Some options:
- BRIGHT: But B-R-I-G-H-T, but that's 6 letters. Wordle is 5-letter words.
- 5-letter words: Like BROKE, but O and E; E is out, so avoid E.
- O could be possible since A and E are out.

Available letters: No C, A, N, E.

Common words:
- PROUD: P-R-O-U-D → R in second.
- But U and O are vowels to test.
- GROWN: G-R-O-W-N → has N? N is out! N is not in the word, so avoid N.

N is invalid, so GROWN has N, which can't be in the word.

So avoid letters: C, A, N, E.

Letters to include: Possibly S, T, L, O, I, etc.

Another word: PRISM: P-R-I-S-M → R in second, with P, I, S, M.

I is a vowel to test, S is a common consonant.

INPUT: I-N-P-U-T, but N is out and second letter is N? No.

Need second letter R.

So P-R-I-S-M seems good: positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), M(5).

This uses P, I, S, M, all new except R.

I could use T instead: TRIPS? T-R-I-P-S → S might be duplicated, but it's fine.

TRIPS has R in second position.

But let's consider the feedback: so far, only R is correct and in place.

Secret word is _ R _ _ _

Possible letters for other positions.

Another common starting point: since CRANE is used, and R is known, perhaps try SHIRT or something, but SHIRT has T.

S-H-I-R-T, but R is third position, not second. I need R in second position in my guess.

So words like BROOK, but has O and K; BROOK is B-R-O-O-K.

O is repeated, might be okay, but O could be tested.

Better to cover more letters.

List of possible 5-letter words with R in second position: 
- BRICK, but C is out.
- BRISK, that could be; B-R-I-S-K, letters B,I,S,K all possible.
- DRINK, D-R-I-N-K, has N, out.
- FRUIT, F-R-U-I-T, no E,A, but U and I.
- GRASP, G-R-A-S-P, A is out.
- PRICE, P-R-I-C-E, C and E out.

PRICE has C and E, both eliminated.

PRISM: P-R-I-S-M, letters P,I,S,M. S is common.

Other options: TRULY: T-R-U-L-Y, U and Y vowels.

ORBIT: O-R-B-I-T, R in second.

ORBIT is O-R-B-I-T, so positions: O, R, B, I, T.

But O is first letter, not using the R position as efficiently? No, R is second, good.

In my guess, I can have different first letters since R is fixed in position.

So ORBIT could be a good guess: it has O, B, I, T, all new except R.

Similarly, URBAN: U-R-B-A-N, but A and N are out, invalid.

URBAN has A and N, both eliminated.

So not good.

GRIMY: G-R-I-M-Y, letters G,I,M,Y.

G and Y might be less common.

I should prioritize common letters like S, T, L.

So back to PRISM: P-R-I-S-M.

Another one: CRISP, but CRISP has C, and C is out, so no.

C is first letter, but C is not in word, so CRISP wouldn't work.

C-R-I-S-P, but C is out.

Similarly, TRAPS: T-R-A-P-S, but A is out.

So avoid A.

DROPS: D-R-O-P-S, has O, P, S.

DROPS is D-R-O-P-S, no eliminated letters.

D-R-O-P-S, letters D,O,P,S.

D and P might be less frequent, but S is good.

SPRITE: S-P-R-I-T-E, 6 letters? SPRIT is not common; SPRITE is 6 letters. Better to stick to 5.

5-letter: SPROG? Not common.

Better words: ORBIS? Not common.

USUAL: U-S-U-A-L, R not second.

Need R second.

STRIP: S-T-R-I-P, R is third position! S-T-R, so R is third, but I need R in second for this guess? No.

In my guess, since I know R is fixed in position 2, I should keep it there to confirm and test other positions.

So in guess 2, I should have R in the second position again to verify or get more feedback on other letters.

Thus, word like X R Y Z W, where X,Y,Z,W are new letters, excluding C,A,N,E.

Possible words:
- BROIL: B-R-O-I-L, letters B,O,I,L
- GROWL: G-R-O-W-L, has W,L
- PROWL: P-R-O-W-L
- TRAIN: T-R-A-I-N, A and N out, invalid.
- FROND: F-R-O-N-D, N out.
- GRIND: G-R-I-N-D, N out.

So, B R something.

BRISK: B-R-I-S-K, as I thought earlier.

PRISM: P-R-I-S-M

DRUID: D-R-U-I-D, U and D, but D repeated? It's okay, letters D,U,I.

I and U vowels.

TRIPE: T-R-I-P-E, E out.

Not good.

BRICK: B-R-I-C-K, C out.

So PRISM seems fine: P-R-I-S-M

Similarly, TRIMS: T-R-I-M-S, but S could be last.

Another one: HORDE, H-O-R-D-E, R is third position; not second.

I need R to be second letter.

PERSU? Not common.

Perhaps URBEX? Not English.

Stick to common words.

Another common word: BRIDE, B-R-I-D-E, but E is out.

B R I D E, E eliminated.

So, BROOD: B-R-O-O-D, O repeated.

Not efficient.

GROUT: G-R-O-U-T, letters G,O,U,T.

U and O vowels to test.

PRONG: P-R-O-N-G, N out.

FORUM: F-O-R-U-M, R is third position.

F O R U M, position: F(1), O(2), R(3) – not second.

To have R second, it should be _ R _ _ _

So many words: LIKE BRASH, but BRASH: B-R-A-S-H, A out.

SHARD: S-H-A-R-D, A out and R third.

CURED: C-U-R-E-D, C and E out.

So better: PRISM (P-R-I-S-M) or BRISK (B-R-I-S-K)

BRISK seems common and good: B-R-I-S-K.

Letters: B, I, S, K – all possible.

Similarly, PRISM: P, I, S, M.

B, P, S are consonants; I is vowel.

S is very common, so including S might be helpful.

CRISP is out due to C.

Another word: TRUCK, T-R-U-C-K, C out.

So not.

GLORY: G-L-O-R-Y, R fourth.

I think BRISK or PRISM are fine.

Let me choose BRISK: it's a common Wordle word.

So guess: BRISK

But let's confirm: B-R-I-S-K

In the feedback, I can see which of B, I, S, K are in the word and where.

If I get feedback, I might identify the word faster.

PRISM might be equally good.

I recall that in Wordle, words like STOMP or SLATE are common, but with R fixed.

Since A and E are out, vowels are likely O, I, U or Y.

BRISK has I.

PRISM also has I.

But PRISM has M which is less common; BRISK has K which is common.

K is common in endings.

BRISK ends with K.

But let's pick one.

I'll go with BRISK for the second guess.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)

- R is confirmed to be in the secret word and in the correct position (second letter). So the secret word has the form _ R _ _ _.
- C, A, N, and E are eliminated; they are not in the secret word.

For the second guess:
- The word must have R in the second position to leverage the known correct position.
- It should avoid C, A, N, E entirely.
- It should include new common letters to maximize information gain, such as testing other vowels (e.g., I, O, U) or frequent consonants (e.g., B, S, K, T).
- Considering above, ""brisk"" is a good choice: B-R-I-S-K. This tests B, I, S, and K, all new letters not eliminated.

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>First, I have the feedback from Guess 1: CRANE → C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)

This means:
- R is in the secret word and it's in the correct position (position 2).
- C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has R as the second letter, and it does not contain C, A, N, or E.

Since R is in position 2, the word looks like: _ R _ _ _

Now, I need to make a second guess. I should choose a word that:
1. Has R in the second position again, to confirm or get more clues.
2. Avoids the letters C, A, N, E since they're not in the word.
3. Includes other common vowels or consonants to test for presence.

Common vowels left are: O, I, U (since A and E are out). But E is out, so vowels to try could be O, I, U.

Consonants: Avoid C, N; common ones like S, T, L, etc. might be good.

Since A and E are not in the word, the word might have different vowels, like O, I, U, or even Y.

Possible letters to include in the guess: S, T, L, O, I, U, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, etc.

I should aim for a word with R in the second position and new letters to test.

A good strategy is to test more vowels or frequent consonants.

Let me think of some words that start with a consonant, have R second, and end with something.

Common words: Words like BRIX? No, not common; better to use real words.

Examples:
- TRYST: But that has E? No, TRYST is T-R-Y-S-T. Positions: T? R? Y? S? T.

But I need R in second position.

So, let's list words that have the second letter as R.

Some options:
- BRIGHT: But B-R-I-G-H-T, but that's 6 letters. Wordle is 5-letter words.
- 5-letter words: Like BROKE, but O and E; E is out, so avoid E.
- O could be possible since A and E are out.

Available letters: No C, A, N, E.

Common words:
- PROUD: P-R-O-U-D → R in second.
- But U and O are vowels to test.
- GROWN: G-R-O-W-N → has N? N is out! N is not in the word, so avoid N.

N is invalid, so GROWN has N, which can't be in the word.

So avoid letters: C, A, N, E.

Letters to include: Possibly S, T, L, O, I, etc.

Another word: PRISM: P-R-I-S-M → R in second, with P, I, S, M.

I is a vowel to test, S is a common consonant.

INPUT: I-N-P-U-T, but N is out and second letter is N? No.

Need second letter R.

So P-R-I-S-M seems good: positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), M(5).

This uses P, I, S, M, all new except R.

I could use T instead: TRIPS? T-R-I-P-S → S might be duplicated, but it's fine.

TRIPS has R in second position.

But let's consider the feedback: so far, only R is correct and in place.

Secret word is _ R _ _ _

Possible letters for other positions.

Another common starting point: since CRANE is used, and R is known, perhaps try SHIRT or something, but SHIRT has T.

S-H-I-R-T, but R is third position, not second. I need R in second position in my guess.

So words like BROOK, but has O and K; BROOK is B-R-O-O-K.

O is repeated, might be okay, but O could be tested.

Better to cover more letters.

List of possible 5-letter words with R in second position: 
- BRICK, but C is out.
- BRISK, that could be; B-R-I-S-K, letters B,I,S,K all possible.
- DRINK, D-R-I-N-K, has N, out.
- FRUIT, F-R-U-I-T, no E,A, but U and I.
- GRASP, G-R-A-S-P, A is out.
- PRICE, P-R-I-C-E, C and E out.

PRICE has C and E, both eliminated.

PRISM: P-R-I-S-M, letters P,I,S,M. S is common.

Other options: TRULY: T-R-U-L-Y, U and Y vowels.

ORBIT: O-R-B-I-T, R in second.

ORBIT is O-R-B-I-T, so positions: O, R, B, I, T.

But O is first letter, not using the R position as efficiently? No, R is second, good.

In my guess, I can have different first letters since R is fixed in position.

So ORBIT could be a good guess: it has O, B, I, T, all new except R.

Similarly, URBAN: U-R-B-A-N, but A and N are out, invalid.

URBAN has A and N, both eliminated.

So not good.

GRIMY: G-R-I-M-Y, letters G,I,M,Y.

G and Y might be less common.

I should prioritize common letters like S, T, L.

So back to PRISM: P-R-I-S-M.

Another one: CRISP, but CRISP has C, and C is out, so no.

C is first letter, but C is not in word, so CRISP wouldn't work.

C-R-I-S-P, but C is out.

Similarly, TRAPS: T-R-A-P-S, but A is out.

So avoid A.

DROPS: D-R-O-P-S, has O, P, S.

DROPS is D-R-O-P-S, no eliminated letters.

D-R-O-P-S, letters D,O,P,S.

D and P might be less frequent, but S is good.

SPRITE: S-P-R-I-T-E, 6 letters? SPRIT is not common; SPRITE is 6 letters. Better to stick to 5.

5-letter: SPROG? Not common.

Better words: ORBIS? Not common.

USUAL: U-S-U-A-L, R not second.

Need R second.

STRIP: S-T-R-I-P, R is third position! S-T-R, so R is third, but I need R in second for this guess? No.

In my guess, since I know R is fixed in position 2, I should keep it there to confirm and test other positions.

So in guess 2, I should have R in the second position again to verify or get more feedback on other letters.

Thus, word like X R Y Z W, where X,Y,Z,W are new letters, excluding C,A,N,E.

Possible words:
- BROIL: B-R-O-I-L, letters B,O,I,L
- GROWL: G-R-O-W-L, has W,L
- PROWL: P-R-O-W-L
- TRAIN: T-R-A-I-N, A and N out, invalid.
- FROND: F-R-O-N-D, N out.
- GRIND: G-R-I-N-D, N out.

So, B R something.

BRISK: B-R-I-S-K, as I thought earlier.

PRISM: P-R-I-S-M

DRUID: D-R-U-I-D, U and D, but D repeated? It's okay, letters D,U,I.

I and U vowels.

TRIPE: T-R-I-P-E, E out.

Not good.

BRICK: B-R-I-C-K, C out.

So PRISM seems fine: P-R-I-S-M

Similarly, TRIMS: T-R-I-M-S, but S could be last.

Another one: HORDE, H-O-R-D-E, R is third position; not second.

I need R to be second letter.

PERSU? Not common.

Perhaps URBEX? Not English.

Stick to common words.

Another common word: BRIDE, B-R-I-D-E, but E is out.

B R I D E, E eliminated.

So, BROOD: B-R-O-O-D, O repeated.

Not efficient.

GROUT: G-R-O-U-T, letters G,O,U,T.

U and O vowels to test.

PRONG: P-R-O-N-G, N out.

FORUM: F-O-R-U-M, R is third position.

F O R U M, position: F(1), O(2), R(3) – not second.

To have R second, it should be _ R _ _ _

So many words: LIKE BRASH, but BRASH: B-R-A-S-H, A out.

SHARD: S-H-A-R-D, A out and R third.

CURED: C-U-R-E-D, C and E out.

So better: PRISM (P-R-I-S-M) or BRISK (B-R-I-S-K)

BRISK seems common and good: B-R-I-S-K.

Letters: B, I, S, K – all possible.

Similarly, PRISM: P, I, S, M.

B, P, S are consonants; I is vowel.

S is very common, so including S might be helpful.

CRISP is out due to C.

Another word: TRUCK, T-R-U-C-K, C out.

So not.

GLORY: G-L-O-R-Y, R fourth.

I think BRISK or PRISM are fine.

Let me choose BRISK: it's a common Wordle word.

So guess: BRISK

But let's confirm: B-R-I-S-K

In the feedback, I can see which of B, I, S, K are in the word and where.

If I get feedback, I might identify the word faster.

PRISM might be equally good.

I recall that in Wordle, words like STOMP or SLATE are common, but with R fixed.

Since A and E are out, vowels are likely O, I, U or Y.

BRISK has I.

PRISM also has I.

But PRISM has M which is less common; BRISK has K which is common.

K is common in endings.

BRISK ends with K.

But let's pick one.

I'll go with BRISK for the second guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)

- R is confirmed to be in the secret word and in the correct position (second letter). So the secret word has the form _ R _ _ _.
- C, A, N, and E are eliminated; they are not in the secret word.

For the second guess:
- The word must have R in the second position to leverage the known correct position.
- It should avoid C, A, N, E entirely.
- It should include new common letters to maximize information gain, such as testing other vowels (e.g., I, O, U) or frequent consonants (e.g., B, S, K, T).
- Considering above, ""brisk"" is a good choice: B-R-I-S-K. This tests B, I, S, and K, all new letters not eliminated.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd).
- C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: brisk -> B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)
- R is again confirmed in the 2nd position (as expected).
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position (since it's marked as present but not correct position? Wait, the feedback is S(✓) which means S is in the word and in the correct position? Let me check the feedback format.

The feedback format is:
- ✓ : correct letter in correct position
- - : letter in word but wrong position
- x : letter not in word

In guess 2: B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)

So:
- B is not in the word (x)
- R is correct and in position 2 (✓)
- I is not in the word (x)
- S is correct and in position 4? Because S is the 4th letter in ""brisk"", and it has ✓, so S is in the word and in the correct position (4th).
- K is not in the word (x)

Therefore, from guess 2:
- S is in the word and in the 4th position.
- B, I, K are not in the word.

Also, from guess 1, we know C, A, N, E are not in the word.

So now we know:
- The secret word has R in position 2 and S in position 4.
- So the word is: _ R _ S _
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, B, I, K

We need to find a word that fits _ R _ S _

Available letters: We must avoid C, A, N, E, B, I, K.

Common letters left: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but some are less common).

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5.

Position 1: can be a consonant or vowel? Since A, E, I are out, possible vowels are O, U, and sometimes Y.

Position 3: same, can be a consonant or vowel.

Position 5: typically a consonant, but can be a vowel or Y.

We should choose a word that tests common remaining letters to narrow down possibilities.

Possible words: Let's think of 5-letter words with second letter R, fourth letter S.

Examples:
- TRUST: T R U S T -> but T is in position 1 and 5? We don't know if T is in the word.
- GROWS: G R O W S -> but S is in position 5, not 4. We need S in position 4.
- We need _ R _ S _, so third letter can be anything, and then S in fourth.

More examples:
- PRESS: P R E S S -> but E is eliminated, so no.
- CROSS: C is eliminated.
- DRESS: D R E S S -> E eliminated.
- GRASS: G R A S S -> A eliminated.
- TRUSS: T R U S S -> this could be, letters T, R, U, S, S. S is repeated, but that's okay. Position: T(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), S(5). But we have S in position 4, and position 5 is also S? The word is T R U S S.

But we have S in position 4, which is correct, and position 5 is S, which might be okay if the word has two S's? But in feedback, for guess 2, S was in position 4 and marked correct, but we don't know if there is another S.

In ""brisk"", S was in position 4 and marked ✓, meaning it is correct and in position. But the secret word has S in position 4, and it might have another S elsewhere? We don't know.

But in TRUSS, it has S in position 4 and 5, so if we guess it, we might get information.

But let's list possible words without eliminated letters.

Eliminated: A, B, C, E, I, K, N

So available: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Now, words of form _ R _ S _

Possible:
- DRUMS: D R U M S -> S is in position 5, not 4. We need S in position 4, so the word must have the fourth letter S.
- So the pattern is: position 1: ?, position 2: R, position 3: ?, position 4: S, position 5: ?

So for example:
- TRUMP: T R U M P -> but no S? Position 4 is M, not S. Not matching.
- We need position 4 to be S.

So:
- Words like: PRISM, but we used that? No, we didn't use PRISM, but in guess 2 we used BRISK, which has S in position 4? BRISK is B-R-I-S-K, so position 4 is S, and it was correct.

But PRISM is P-R-I-S-M, which has I, and I is eliminated now, so we can't use PRISM because I is not in the word.

Similarly, other words.

List of possible words with _ R _ S _ and no A,B,C,E,I,K,N.

For position 1: possible letters: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Position 3: same set.

Position 5: same set.

Common words:
- FROST: F R O S T -> position 4 is S? F-R-O-S-T, so position 1:F, 2:R, 3:O, 4:S, 5:T. And O and T are not eliminated. So FROST is a candidate.
- PROST: not a word, usually.
- GROSS: G R O S S -> position 4 is S, position 5 is S. G and O available.
- TROSS: not common.
- CROSS: C eliminated.
- DROSS: D R O S S -> D and O available.
- PROSE: P R O S E -> but E is eliminated.
- VERSE: V E R S E, E eliminated and R position wrong.
- WORSE: W O R S E, E eliminated.
- PURSE: P U R S E, E eliminated.
- HORSE: H O R S E, E eliminated.
- TRUSS: T R U S S -> T and U available.
- GRUMP: no S.
- DRUMS: position 5 S, not 4.
- TRUMP: no S.
- FRUMP: not common, and no S in 4th.
- PRESS: E eliminated.

So possible candidates: FROST, GROSS, DROSS, TRUSS.

Also, others:
- WREST: W R E S T, E eliminated.
- CRUST: C eliminated.
- TRUST: T R U S T -> position 4 is S? T-R-U-S-T, so position 1:T, 2:R, 3:U, 4:S, 5:T. T is repeated. And U available. So TRUST is a candidate.
- GRASP: A eliminated.
- CLASP: C and A eliminated.

Another one: PROWS? P R O W S, S in position 5, not 4.

So main candidates: FROST, GROSS, DROSS, TRUST, TRUSS.

DROSS: D-R-O-S-S, so positions: D(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), S(5)

GROSS: G(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), S(5)

FROST: F(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), T(5)

TRUST: T(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), T(5)

TRUSS: T(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), S(5)

We need to choose one that tests new letters.

We have not tested: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But O and T are in multiple candidates.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that has letters not in the candidates, but we need to solve.

Since we have only three positions to guess, and we know two letters, we can try to cover more possibilities.

But we have 6 guesses, so we can be efficient.

Another candidate: PROSY? Not common.

Or TORSO: T O R S O, but R is third position? T-O-R-S-O, position 2 is O, not R. We need R in position 2.

So not.

FOCUS: F O C U S, C eliminated and position wrong.

So back to the list.

We can choose FROST: it has F, O, T which are new.

Similarly, TRUST has T and U.

But in TRUST, T is in position 1 and 5, so if T is not in the word, we eliminate T, but if it is, we might get feedback.

But we don't know if T is in the word.

Similarly for FROST, we test F, O, T.

O is a vowel that hasn't been tested, so it might be good to test O.

In FROST, position 3 is O, which is a vowel position.

Similarly, in TRUST, position 3 is U, another vowel.

Since we have no vowels except possibly O or U, testing a word with O or U is good.

We also have S in position 4, which is fixed.

Now, for the third guess, I think FROST is a good choice because it tests F, O, T.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Similarly, if we choose TRUST, it tests T and U.

But FROST has three new letters: F, O, T.

GROSS has G and O, but S is repeated, so less information.

DROSS has D and O.

TRUSS has T and U, but S repeated.

So FROST seems best: new letters F, O, T.

Guess: FROST

But let's see the pattern: _ R _ S _

If we guess FROST, it is F R O S T.

If it's correct, great. If not, we get feedback on F, O, T.

For example, if O is in the word but wrong position, or not, etc.

Similarly for T.

So I think FROST is a solid choice.

We could choose a word with more unique letters, but FROST has all unique.

Another word: PROUD, but no S in fourth.

Not.

So I'll go with FROST.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
  - R is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 2.  
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: brisk** → B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)  
  - R is confirmed in position 2 (as expected).  
  - S is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 4.  
  - B, I, K are not in the word.  

### Current Knowledge:
- The secret word has the form: ** _ R _ S _** (position 2 is R, position 4 is S).  
- Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, E, B, I, K** (not in the word).  
- Available letters for positions 1, 3, and 5: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
- Key strategy for the next guess:  
  - Must have R in position 2 and S in position 4 to maintain known positions.  
  - Avoid eliminated letters.  
  - Test new common letters to gather more information, especially focusing on untested vowels (O, U) and frequent consonants (T, F, G, etc.).  
  - Prioritize words with unique letters to maximize information gain.  

### Why ""frost"" is a good guess:
- Fits the pattern: **F R O S T** (position 1: F, position 2: R, position 3: O, position 4: S, position 5: T).  
- Tests three new common letters:  
  - **F**: A frequent consonant not yet tested.  
  - **O**: An untested vowel (since A, E, I are eliminated, O is a likely candidate).  
  - **T**: A very common consonant, often in word endings.  
- Avoids eliminated letters and repeats.  
- If incorrect, the feedback will provide information on F, O, and T (e.g., if O is in the word but in the wrong position, or if F/T are present or absent), which will significantly narrow down possibilities for the next guess.  

<guess>frost</guess>",frost,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd).
- C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: brisk -> B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)
- R is again confirmed in the 2nd position (as expected).
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position (since it's marked as present but not correct position? Wait, the feedback is S(✓) which means S is in the word and in the correct position? Let me check the feedback format.

The feedback format is:
- ✓ : correct letter in correct position
- - : letter in word but wrong position
- x : letter not in word

In guess 2: B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)

So:
- B is not in the word (x)
- R is correct and in position 2 (✓)
- I is not in the word (x)
- S is correct and in position 4? Because S is the 4th letter in ""brisk"", and it has ✓, so S is in the word and in the correct position (4th).
- K is not in the word (x)

Therefore, from guess 2:
- S is in the word and in the 4th position.
- B, I, K are not in the word.

Also, from guess 1, we know C, A, N, E are not in the word.

So now we know:
- The secret word has R in position 2 and S in position 4.
- So the word is: _ R _ S _
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, B, I, K

We need to find a word that fits _ R _ S _

Available letters: We must avoid C, A, N, E, B, I, K.

Common letters left: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but some are less common).

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5.

Position 1: can be a consonant or vowel? Since A, E, I are out, possible vowels are O, U, and sometimes Y.

Position 3: same, can be a consonant or vowel.

Position 5: typically a consonant, but can be a vowel or Y.

We should choose a word that tests common remaining letters to narrow down possibilities.

Possible words: Let's think of 5-letter words with second letter R, fourth letter S.

Examples:
- TRUST: T R U S T -> but T is in position 1 and 5? We don't know if T is in the word.
- GROWS: G R O W S -> but S is in position 5, not 4. We need S in position 4.
- We need _ R _ S _, so third letter can be anything, and then S in fourth.

More examples:
- PRESS: P R E S S -> but E is eliminated, so no.
- CROSS: C is eliminated.
- DRESS: D R E S S -> E eliminated.
- GRASS: G R A S S -> A eliminated.
- TRUSS: T R U S S -> this could be, letters T, R, U, S, S. S is repeated, but that's okay. Position: T(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), S(5). But we have S in position 4, and position 5 is also S? The word is T R U S S.

But we have S in position 4, which is correct, and position 5 is S, which might be okay if the word has two S's? But in feedback, for guess 2, S was in position 4 and marked correct, but we don't know if there is another S.

In ""brisk"", S was in position 4 and marked ✓, meaning it is correct and in position. But the secret word has S in position 4, and it might have another S elsewhere? We don't know.

But in TRUSS, it has S in position 4 and 5, so if we guess it, we might get information.

But let's list possible words without eliminated letters.

Eliminated: A, B, C, E, I, K, N

So available: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Now, words of form _ R _ S _

Possible:
- DRUMS: D R U M S -> S is in position 5, not 4. We need S in position 4, so the word must have the fourth letter S.
- So the pattern is: position 1: ?, position 2: R, position 3: ?, position 4: S, position 5: ?

So for example:
- TRUMP: T R U M P -> but no S? Position 4 is M, not S. Not matching.
- We need position 4 to be S.

So:
- Words like: PRISM, but we used that? No, we didn't use PRISM, but in guess 2 we used BRISK, which has S in position 4? BRISK is B-R-I-S-K, so position 4 is S, and it was correct.

But PRISM is P-R-I-S-M, which has I, and I is eliminated now, so we can't use PRISM because I is not in the word.

Similarly, other words.

List of possible words with _ R _ S _ and no A,B,C,E,I,K,N.

For position 1: possible letters: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Position 3: same set.

Position 5: same set.

Common words:
- FROST: F R O S T -> position 4 is S? F-R-O-S-T, so position 1:F, 2:R, 3:O, 4:S, 5:T. And O and T are not eliminated. So FROST is a candidate.
- PROST: not a word, usually.
- GROSS: G R O S S -> position 4 is S, position 5 is S. G and O available.
- TROSS: not common.
- CROSS: C eliminated.
- DROSS: D R O S S -> D and O available.
- PROSE: P R O S E -> but E is eliminated.
- VERSE: V E R S E, E eliminated and R position wrong.
- WORSE: W O R S E, E eliminated.
- PURSE: P U R S E, E eliminated.
- HORSE: H O R S E, E eliminated.
- TRUSS: T R U S S -> T and U available.
- GRUMP: no S.
- DRUMS: position 5 S, not 4.
- TRUMP: no S.
- FRUMP: not common, and no S in 4th.
- PRESS: E eliminated.

So possible candidates: FROST, GROSS, DROSS, TRUSS.

Also, others:
- WREST: W R E S T, E eliminated.
- CRUST: C eliminated.
- TRUST: T R U S T -> position 4 is S? T-R-U-S-T, so position 1:T, 2:R, 3:U, 4:S, 5:T. T is repeated. And U available. So TRUST is a candidate.
- GRASP: A eliminated.
- CLASP: C and A eliminated.

Another one: PROWS? P R O W S, S in position 5, not 4.

So main candidates: FROST, GROSS, DROSS, TRUST, TRUSS.

DROSS: D-R-O-S-S, so positions: D(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), S(5)

GROSS: G(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), S(5)

FROST: F(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), T(5)

TRUST: T(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), T(5)

TRUSS: T(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), S(5)

We need to choose one that tests new letters.

We have not tested: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But O and T are in multiple candidates.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that has letters not in the candidates, but we need to solve.

Since we have only three positions to guess, and we know two letters, we can try to cover more possibilities.

But we have 6 guesses, so we can be efficient.

Another candidate: PROSY? Not common.

Or TORSO: T O R S O, but R is third position? T-O-R-S-O, position 2 is O, not R. We need R in position 2.

So not.

FOCUS: F O C U S, C eliminated and position wrong.

So back to the list.

We can choose FROST: it has F, O, T which are new.

Similarly, TRUST has T and U.

But in TRUST, T is in position 1 and 5, so if T is not in the word, we eliminate T, but if it is, we might get feedback.

But we don't know if T is in the word.

Similarly for FROST, we test F, O, T.

O is a vowel that hasn't been tested, so it might be good to test O.

In FROST, position 3 is O, which is a vowel position.

Similarly, in TRUST, position 3 is U, another vowel.

Since we have no vowels except possibly O or U, testing a word with O or U is good.

We also have S in position 4, which is fixed.

Now, for the third guess, I think FROST is a good choice because it tests F, O, T.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Similarly, if we choose TRUST, it tests T and U.

But FROST has three new letters: F, O, T.

GROSS has G and O, but S is repeated, so less information.

DROSS has D and O.

TRUSS has T and U, but S repeated.

So FROST seems best: new letters F, O, T.

Guess: FROST

But let's see the pattern: _ R _ S _

If we guess FROST, it is F R O S T.

If it's correct, great. If not, we get feedback on F, O, T.

For example, if O is in the word but wrong position, or not, etc.

Similarly for T.

So I think FROST is a solid choice.

We could choose a word with more unique letters, but FROST has all unique.

Another word: PROUD, but no S in fourth.

Not.

So I'll go with FROST.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
  - R is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 2.  
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: brisk** → B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)  
  - R is confirmed in position 2 (as expected).  
  - S is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 4.  
  - B, I, K are not in the word.  

### Current Knowledge:
- The secret word has the form: ** _ R _ S _** (position 2 is R, position 4 is S).  
- Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, E, B, I, K** (not in the word).  
- Available letters for positions 1, 3, and 5: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
- Key strategy for the next guess:  
  - Must have R in position 2 and S in position 4 to maintain known positions.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>First, I have the feedback from Guess 1: CRANE → C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)

This means:
- R is in the secret word and it's in the correct position (position 2).
- C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has R as the second letter, and it does not contain C, A, N, or E.

Since R is in position 2, the word looks like: _ R _ _ _

Now, I need to make a second guess. I should choose a word that:
1. Has R in the second position again, to confirm or get more clues.
2. Avoids the letters C, A, N, E since they're not in the word.
3. Includes other common vowels or consonants to test for presence.

Common vowels left are: O, I, U (since A and E are out). But E is out, so vowels to try could be O, I, U.

Consonants: Avoid C, N; common ones like S, T, L, etc. might be good.

Since A and E are not in the word, the word might have different vowels, like O, I, U, or even Y.

Possible letters to include in the guess: S, T, L, O, I, U, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, etc.

I should aim for a word with R in the second position and new letters to test.

A good strategy is to test more vowels or frequent consonants.

Let me think of some words that start with a consonant, have R second, and end with something.

Common words: Words like BRIX? No, not common; better to use real words.

Examples:
- TRYST: But that has E? No, TRYST is T-R-Y-S-T. Positions: T? R? Y? S? T.

But I need R in second position.

So, let's list words that have the second letter as R.

Some options:
- BRIGHT: But B-R-I-G-H-T, but that's 6 letters. Wordle is 5-letter words.
- 5-letter words: Like BROKE, but O and E; E is out, so avoid E.
- O could be possible since A and E are out.

Available letters: No C, A, N, E.

Common words:
- PROUD: P-R-O-U-D → R in second.
- But U and O are vowels to test.
- GROWN: G-R-O-W-N → has N? N is out! N is not in the word, so avoid N.

N is invalid, so GROWN has N, which can't be in the word.

So avoid letters: C, A, N, E.

Letters to include: Possibly S, T, L, O, I, etc.

Another word: PRISM: P-R-I-S-M → R in second, with P, I, S, M.

I is a vowel to test, S is a common consonant.

INPUT: I-N-P-U-T, but N is out and second letter is N? No.

Need second letter R.

So P-R-I-S-M seems good: positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), M(5).

This uses P, I, S, M, all new except R.

I could use T instead: TRIPS? T-R-I-P-S → S might be duplicated, but it's fine.

TRIPS has R in second position.

But let's consider the feedback: so far, only R is correct and in place.

Secret word is _ R _ _ _

Possible letters for other positions.

Another common starting point: since CRANE is used, and R is known, perhaps try SHIRT or something, but SHIRT has T.

S-H-I-R-T, but R is third position, not second. I need R in second position in my guess.

So words like BROOK, but has O and K; BROOK is B-R-O-O-K.

O is repeated, might be okay, but O could be tested.

Better to cover more letters.

List of possible 5-letter words with R in second position: 
- BRICK, but C is out.
- BRISK, that could be; B-R-I-S-K, letters B,I,S,K all possible.
- DRINK, D-R-I-N-K, has N, out.
- FRUIT, F-R-U-I-T, no E,A, but U and I.
- GRASP, G-R-A-S-P, A is out.
- PRICE, P-R-I-C-E, C and E out.

PRICE has C and E, both eliminated.

PRISM: P-R-I-S-M, letters P,I,S,M. S is common.

Other options: TRULY: T-R-U-L-Y, U and Y vowels.

ORBIT: O-R-B-I-T, R in second.

ORBIT is O-R-B-I-T, so positions: O, R, B, I, T.

But O is first letter, not using the R position as efficiently? No, R is second, good.

In my guess, I can have different first letters since R is fixed in position.

So ORBIT could be a good guess: it has O, B, I, T, all new except R.

Similarly, URBAN: U-R-B-A-N, but A and N are out, invalid.

URBAN has A and N, both eliminated.

So not good.

GRIMY: G-R-I-M-Y, letters G,I,M,Y.

G and Y might be less common.

I should prioritize common letters like S, T, L.

So back to PRISM: P-R-I-S-M.

Another one: CRISP, but CRISP has C, and C is out, so no.

C is first letter, but C is not in word, so CRISP wouldn't work.

C-R-I-S-P, but C is out.

Similarly, TRAPS: T-R-A-P-S, but A is out.

So avoid A.

DROPS: D-R-O-P-S, has O, P, S.

DROPS is D-R-O-P-S, no eliminated letters.

D-R-O-P-S, letters D,O,P,S.

D and P might be less frequent, but S is good.

SPRITE: S-P-R-I-T-E, 6 letters? SPRIT is not common; SPRITE is 6 letters. Better to stick to 5.

5-letter: SPROG? Not common.

Better words: ORBIS? Not common.

USUAL: U-S-U-A-L, R not second.

Need R second.

STRIP: S-T-R-I-P, R is third position! S-T-R, so R is third, but I need R in second for this guess? No.

In my guess, since I know R is fixed in position 2, I should keep it there to confirm and test other positions.

So in guess 2, I should have R in the second position again to verify or get more feedback on other letters.

Thus, word like X R Y Z W, where X,Y,Z,W are new letters, excluding C,A,N,E.

Possible words:
- BROIL: B-R-O-I-L, letters B,O,I,L
- GROWL: G-R-O-W-L, has W,L
- PROWL: P-R-O-W-L
- TRAIN: T-R-A-I-N, A and N out, invalid.
- FROND: F-R-O-N-D, N out.
- GRIND: G-R-I-N-D, N out.

So, B R something.

BRISK: B-R-I-S-K, as I thought earlier.

PRISM: P-R-I-S-M

DRUID: D-R-U-I-D, U and D, but D repeated? It's okay, letters D,U,I.

I and U vowels.

TRIPE: T-R-I-P-E, E out.

Not good.

BRICK: B-R-I-C-K, C out.

So PRISM seems fine: P-R-I-S-M

Similarly, TRIMS: T-R-I-M-S, but S could be last.

Another one: HORDE, H-O-R-D-E, R is third position; not second.

I need R to be second letter.

PERSU? Not common.

Perhaps URBEX? Not English.

Stick to common words.

Another common word: BRIDE, B-R-I-D-E, but E is out.

B R I D E, E eliminated.

So, BROOD: B-R-O-O-D, O repeated.

Not efficient.

GROUT: G-R-O-U-T, letters G,O,U,T.

U and O vowels to test.

PRONG: P-R-O-N-G, N out.

FORUM: F-O-R-U-M, R is third position.

F O R U M, position: F(1), O(2), R(3) – not second.

To have R second, it should be _ R _ _ _

So many words: LIKE BRASH, but BRASH: B-R-A-S-H, A out.

SHARD: S-H-A-R-D, A out and R third.

CURED: C-U-R-E-D, C and E out.

So better: PRISM (P-R-I-S-M) or BRISK (B-R-I-S-K)

BRISK seems common and good: B-R-I-S-K.

Letters: B, I, S, K – all possible.

Similarly, PRISM: P, I, S, M.

B, P, S are consonants; I is vowel.

S is very common, so including S might be helpful.

CRISP is out due to C.

Another word: TRUCK, T-R-U-C-K, C out.

So not.

GLORY: G-L-O-R-Y, R fourth.

I think BRISK or PRISM are fine.

Let me choose BRISK: it's a common Wordle word.

So guess: BRISK

But let's confirm: B-R-I-S-K

In the feedback, I can see which of B, I, S, K are in the word and where.

If I get feedback, I might identify the word faster.

PRISM might be equally good.

I recall that in Wordle, words like STOMP or SLATE are common, but with R fixed.

Since A and E are out, vowels are likely O, I, U or Y.

BRISK has I.

PRISM also has I.

But PRISM has M which is less common; BRISK has K which is common.

K is common in endings.

BRISK ends with K.

But let's pick one.

I'll go with BRISK for the second guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)

- R is confirmed to be in the secret word and in the correct position (second letter). So the secret word has the form _ R _ _ _.
- C, A, N, and E are eliminated; they are not in the secret word.

For the second guess:
- The word must have R in the second position to leverage the known correct position.
- It should avoid C, A, N, E entirely.
- It should include new common letters to maximize information gain, such as testing other vowels (e.g., I, O, U) or frequent consonants (e.g., B, S, K, T).
- Considering above, ""brisk"" is a good choice: B-R-I-S-K. This tests B, I, S, and K, all new letters not eliminated.

Guess: brisk  
Expected format:

<guess>brisk</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: brisk -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd).
- C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: brisk -> B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)
- R is again confirmed in the 2nd position (as expected).
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position (since it's marked as present but not correct position? Wait, the feedback is S(✓) which means S is in the word and in the correct position? Let me check the feedback format.

The feedback format is:
- ✓ : correct letter in correct position
- - : letter in word but wrong position
- x : letter not in word

In guess 2: B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)

So:
- B is not in the word (x)
- R is correct and in position 2 (✓)
- I is not in the word (x)
- S is correct and in position 4? Because S is the 4th letter in ""brisk"", and it has ✓, so S is in the word and in the correct position (4th).
- K is not in the word (x)

Therefore, from guess 2:
- S is in the word and in the 4th position.
- B, I, K are not in the word.

Also, from guess 1, we know C, A, N, E are not in the word.

So now we know:
- The secret word has R in position 2 and S in position 4.
- So the word is: _ R _ S _
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, B, I, K

We need to find a word that fits _ R _ S _

Available letters: We must avoid C, A, N, E, B, I, K.

Common letters left: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but some are less common).

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5.

Position 1: can be a consonant or vowel? Since A, E, I are out, possible vowels are O, U, and sometimes Y.

Position 3: same, can be a consonant or vowel.

Position 5: typically a consonant, but can be a vowel or Y.

We should choose a word that tests common remaining letters to narrow down possibilities.

Possible words: Let's think of 5-letter words with second letter R, fourth letter S.

Examples:
- TRUST: T R U S T -> but T is in position 1 and 5? We don't know if T is in the word.
- GROWS: G R O W S -> but S is in position 5, not 4. We need S in position 4.
- We need _ R _ S _, so third letter can be anything, and then S in fourth.

More examples:
- PRESS: P R E S S -> but E is eliminated, so no.
- CROSS: C is eliminated.
- DRESS: D R E S S -> E eliminated.
- GRASS: G R A S S -> A eliminated.
- TRUSS: T R U S S -> this could be, letters T, R, U, S, S. S is repeated, but that's okay. Position: T(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), S(5). But we have S in position 4, and position 5 is also S? The word is T R U S S.

But we have S in position 4, which is correct, and position 5 is S, which might be okay if the word has two S's? But in feedback, for guess 2, S was in position 4 and marked correct, but we don't know if there is another S.

In ""brisk"", S was in position 4 and marked ✓, meaning it is correct and in position. But the secret word has S in position 4, and it might have another S elsewhere? We don't know.

But in TRUSS, it has S in position 4 and 5, so if we guess it, we might get information.

But let's list possible words without eliminated letters.

Eliminated: A, B, C, E, I, K, N

So available: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Now, words of form _ R _ S _

Possible:
- DRUMS: D R U M S -> S is in position 5, not 4. We need S in position 4, so the word must have the fourth letter S.
- So the pattern is: position 1: ?, position 2: R, position 3: ?, position 4: S, position 5: ?

So for example:
- TRUMP: T R U M P -> but no S? Position 4 is M, not S. Not matching.
- We need position 4 to be S.

So:
- Words like: PRISM, but we used that? No, we didn't use PRISM, but in guess 2 we used BRISK, which has S in position 4? BRISK is B-R-I-S-K, so position 4 is S, and it was correct.

But PRISM is P-R-I-S-M, which has I, and I is eliminated now, so we can't use PRISM because I is not in the word.

Similarly, other words.

List of possible words with _ R _ S _ and no A,B,C,E,I,K,N.

For position 1: possible letters: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Position 3: same set.

Position 5: same set.

Common words:
- FROST: F R O S T -> position 4 is S? F-R-O-S-T, so position 1:F, 2:R, 3:O, 4:S, 5:T. And O and T are not eliminated. So FROST is a candidate.
- PROST: not a word, usually.
- GROSS: G R O S S -> position 4 is S, position 5 is S. G and O available.
- TROSS: not common.
- CROSS: C eliminated.
- DROSS: D R O S S -> D and O available.
- PROSE: P R O S E -> but E is eliminated.
- VERSE: V E R S E, E eliminated and R position wrong.
- WORSE: W O R S E, E eliminated.
- PURSE: P U R S E, E eliminated.
- HORSE: H O R S E, E eliminated.
- TRUSS: T R U S S -> T and U available.
- GRUMP: no S.
- DRUMS: position 5 S, not 4.
- TRUMP: no S.
- FRUMP: not common, and no S in 4th.
- PRESS: E eliminated.

So possible candidates: FROST, GROSS, DROSS, TRUSS.

Also, others:
- WREST: W R E S T, E eliminated.
- CRUST: C eliminated.
- TRUST: T R U S T -> position 4 is S? T-R-U-S-T, so position 1:T, 2:R, 3:U, 4:S, 5:T. T is repeated. And U available. So TRUST is a candidate.
- GRASP: A eliminated.
- CLASP: C and A eliminated.

Another one: PROWS? P R O W S, S in position 5, not 4.

So main candidates: FROST, GROSS, DROSS, TRUST, TRUSS.

DROSS: D-R-O-S-S, so positions: D(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), S(5)

GROSS: G(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), S(5)

FROST: F(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), T(5)

TRUST: T(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), T(5)

TRUSS: T(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), S(5)

We need to choose one that tests new letters.

We have not tested: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But O and T are in multiple candidates.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that has letters not in the candidates, but we need to solve.

Since we have only three positions to guess, and we know two letters, we can try to cover more possibilities.

But we have 6 guesses, so we can be efficient.

Another candidate: PROSY? Not common.

Or TORSO: T O R S O, but R is third position? T-O-R-S-O, position 2 is O, not R. We need R in position 2.

So not.

FOCUS: F O C U S, C eliminated and position wrong.

So back to the list.

We can choose FROST: it has F, O, T which are new.

Similarly, TRUST has T and U.

But in TRUST, T is in position 1 and 5, so if T is not in the word, we eliminate T, but if it is, we might get feedback.

But we don't know if T is in the word.

Similarly for FROST, we test F, O, T.

O is a vowel that hasn't been tested, so it might be good to test O.

In FROST, position 3 is O, which is a vowel position.

Similarly, in TRUST, position 3 is U, another vowel.

Since we have no vowels except possibly O or U, testing a word with O or U is good.

We also have S in position 4, which is fixed.

Now, for the third guess, I think FROST is a good choice because it tests F, O, T.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Similarly, if we choose TRUST, it tests T and U.

But FROST has three new letters: F, O, T.

GROSS has G and O, but S is repeated, so less information.

DROSS has D and O.

TRUSS has T and U, but S repeated.

So FROST seems best: new letters F, O, T.

Guess: FROST

But let's see the pattern: _ R _ S _

If we guess FROST, it is F R O S T.

If it's correct, great. If not, we get feedback on F, O, T.

For example, if O is in the word but wrong position, or not, etc.

Similarly for T.

So I think FROST is a solid choice.

We could choose a word with more unique letters, but FROST has all unique.

Another word: PROUD, but no S in fourth.

Not.

So I'll go with FROST.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
  - R is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 2.  
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: brisk** → B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)  
  - R is confirmed in position 2 (as expected).  
  - S is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 4.  
  - B, I, K are not in the word.  

### Current Knowledge:
- The secret word has the form: ** _ R _ S _** (position 2 is R, position 4 is S).  
- Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, E, B, I, K** (not in the word).  
- Available letters for positions 1, 3, and 5: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
- Key strategy for the next guess:  
  - Must have R in position 2 and S in position 4 to maintain known positions.  
  - Avoid eliminated letters.  
  - Test new common letters to gather more information, especially focusing on untested vowels (O, U) and frequent consonants (T, F, G, etc.).  
  - Prioritize words with unique letters to maximize information gain.  

### Why ""frost"" is a good guess:
- Fits the pattern: **F R O S T** (position 1: F, position 2: R, position 3: O, position 4: S, position 5: T).  
- Tests three new common letters:  
  - **F**: A frequent consonant not yet tested.  
  - **O**: An untested vowel (since A, E, I are eliminated, O is a likely candidate).  
  - **T**: A very common consonant, often in word endings.  
- Avoids eliminated letters and repeats.  
- If incorrect, the feedback will provide information on F, O, and T (e.g., if O is in the word but in the wrong position, or if F/T are present or absent), which will significantly narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

Not English.\n\nStick to common words.\n\nAnother common word: BRIDE, B-R-I-D-E, but E is out.\n\nB R I D E, E eliminated.\n\nSo, BROOD: B-R-O-O-D, O repeated.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nGROUT: G-R-O-U-T, letters G,O,U,T.\n\nU and O vowels to test.\n\nPRONG: P-R-O-N-G, N out.\n\nFORUM: F-O-R-U-M, R is third position.\n\nF O R U M, position: F(1), O(2), R(3) – not second.\n\nTo have R second, it should be _ R _ _ _\n\nSo many words: LIKE BRASH, but BRASH: B-R-A-S-H, A out.\n\nSHARD: S-H-A-R-D, A out and R third.\n\nCURED: C-U-R-E-D, C and E out.\n\nSo better: PRISM (P-R-I-S-M) or BRISK (B-R-I-S-K)\n\nBRISK seems common and good: B-R-I-S-K.\n\nLetters: B, I, S, K – all possible.\n\nSimilarly, PRISM: P, I, S, M.\n\nB, P, S are consonants; I is vowel.\n\nS is very common, so including S might be helpful.\n\nCRISP is out due to C.\n\nAnother word: TRUCK, T-R-U-C-K, C out.\n\nSo not.\n\nGLORY: G-L-O-R-Y, R fourth.\n\nI think BRISK or PRISM are fine.\n\nLet me choose BRISK: it\'s a common Wordle word.\n\nSo guess: BRISK\n\nBut let\'s confirm: B-R-I-S-K\n\nIn the feedback, I can see which of B, I, S, K are in the word and where.\n\nIf I get feedback, I might identify the word faster.\n\nPRISM might be equally good.\n\nI recall that in Wordle, words like STOMP or SLATE are common, but with R fixed.\n\nSince A and E are out, vowels are likely O, I, U or Y.\n\nBRISK has I.\n\nPRISM also has I.\n\nBut PRISM has M which is less common; BRISK has K which is common.\n\nK is common in endings.\n\nBRISK ends with K.\n\nBut let\'s pick one.\n\nI\'ll go with BRISK for the second guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n\n- R is confirmed to be in the secret word and in the correct position (second letter). So the secret word has the form _ R _ _ _.\n- C, A, N, and E are eliminated; they are not in the secret word.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must have R in the second position to leverage the known correct position.\n- It should avoid C, A, N, E entirely.\n- It should include new common letters to maximize information gain, such as testing other vowels (e.g., I, O, U) or frequent consonants (e.g., B, S, K, T).\n- Considering above, ""brisk"" is a good choice: B-R-I-S-K. This tests B, I, S, and K, all new letters not eliminated.\n\nGuess: brisk  \nExpected format:\n\n<guess>brisk</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: brisk -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n- R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd).\n- C, A, N, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: brisk -> B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)\n- R is again confirmed in the 2nd position (as expected).\n- S is in the word but not in the 4th position (since it\'s marked as present but not correct position? Wait, the feedback is S(✓) which means S is in the word and in the correct position? Let me check the feedback format.\n\nThe feedback format is:\n- ✓ : correct letter in correct position\n- - : letter in word but wrong position\n- x : letter not in word\n\nIn guess 2: B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)\n\nSo:\n- B is not in the word (x)\n- R is correct and in position 2 (✓)\n- I is not in the word (x)\n- S is correct and in position 4? Because S is the 4th letter in ""brisk"", and it has ✓, so S is in the word and in the correct position (4th).\n- K is not in the word (x)\n\nTherefore, from guess 2:\n- S is in the word and in the 4th position.\n- B, I, K are not in the word.\n\nAlso, from guess 1, we know C, A, N, E are not in the word.\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word has R in position 2 and S in position 4.\n- So the word is: _ R _ S _\n- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, B, I, K\n\nWe need to find a word that fits _ R _ S _\n\nAvailable letters: We must avoid C, A, N, E, B, I, K.\n\nCommon letters left: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but some are less common).\n\nWe need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5.\n\nPosition 1: can be a consonant or vowel? Since A, E, I are out, possible vowels are O, U, and sometimes Y.\n\nPosition 3: same, can be a consonant or vowel.\n\nPosition 5: typically a consonant, but can be a vowel or Y.\n\nWe should choose a word that tests common remaining letters to narrow down possibilities.\n\nPossible words: Let\'s think of 5-letter words with second letter R, fourth letter S.\n\nExamples:\n- TRUST: T R U S T -> but T is in position 1 and 5? We don\'t know if T is in the word.\n- GROWS: G R O W S -> but S is in position 5, not 4. We need S in position 4.\n- We need _ R _ S _, so third letter can be anything, and then S in fourth.\n\nMore examples:\n- PRESS: P R E S S -> but E is eliminated, so no.\n- CROSS: C is eliminated.\n- DRESS: D R E S S -> E eliminated.\n- GRASS: G R A S S -> A eliminated.\n- TRUSS: T R U S S -> this could be, letters T, R, U, S, S.

The word is T R U S S.\n\nBut we have S in position 4, which is correct, and position 5 is S, which might be okay if the word has two S\'s? But in feedback, for guess 2, S was in position 4 and marked correct, but we don\'t know if there is another S.\n\nIn ""brisk"", S was in position 4 and marked ✓, meaning it is correct and in position. But the secret word has S in position 4, and it might have another S elsewhere? We don\'t know.\n\nBut in TRUSS, it has S in position 4 and 5, so if we guess it, we might get information.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words without eliminated letters.\n\nEliminated: A, B, C, E, I, K, N\n\nSo available: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nNow, words of form _ R _ S _\n\nPossible:\n- DRUMS: D R U M S -> S is in position 5, not 4. We need S in position 4, so the word must have the fourth letter S.\n- So the pattern is: position 1: ?, position 2: R, position 3: ?, position 4: S, position 5: ?\n\nSo for example:\n- TRUMP: T R U M P -> but no S? Position 4 is M, not S. Not matching.\n- We need position 4 to be S.\n\nSo:\n- Words like: PRISM, but we used that? No, we didn\'t use PRISM, but in guess 2 we used BRISK, which has S in position 4? BRISK is B-R-I-S-K, so position 4 is S, and it was correct.\n\nBut PRISM is P-R-I-S-M, which has I, and I is eliminated now, so we can\'t use PRISM because I is not in the word.\n\nSimilarly, other words.\n\nList of possible words with _ R _ S _ and no A,B,C,E,I,K,N.\n\nFor position 1: possible letters: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nPosition 3: same set.\n\nPosition 5: same set.\n\nCommon words:\n- FROST: F R O S T -> position 4 is S?

T-R-U-S-T, so position 1:T, 2:R, 3:U, 4:S, 5:T. T is repeated. And U available. So TRUST is a candidate.\n- GRASP: A eliminated.\n- CLASP: C and A eliminated.\n\nAnother one: PROWS? P R O W S, S in position 5, not 4.\n\nSo main candidates: FROST, GROSS, DROSS, TRUST, TRUSS.\n\nDROSS: D-R-O-S-S, so positions: D(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), S(5)\n\nGROSS: G(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), S(5)\n\nFROST: F(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), T(5)\n\nTRUST: T(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), T(5)\n\nTRUSS: T(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), S(5)\n\nWe need to choose one that tests new letters.\n\nWe have not tested: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut O and T are in multiple candidates.\n\nTo maximize information, we should choose a word that has letters not in the candidates, but we need to solve.\n\nSince we have only three positions to guess, and we know two letters, we can try to cover more possibilities.\n\nBut we have 6 guesses, so we can be efficient.\n\nAnother candidate: PROSY? Not common.\n\nOr TORSO: T O R S O, but R is third position? T-O-R-S-O, position 2 is O, not R. We need R in position 2.\n\nSo not.\n\nFOCUS: F O C U S, C eliminated and position wrong.\n\nSo back to the list.\n\nWe can choose FROST: it has F, O, T which are new.\n\nSimilarly, TRUST has T and U.\n\nBut in TRUST, T is in position 1 and 5, so if T is not in the word, we eliminate T, but if it is, we might get feedback.\n\nBut we don\'t know if T is in the word.\n\nSimilarly for FROST, we test F, O, T.\n\nO is a vowel that hasn\'t been tested, so it might be good to test O.\n\nIn FROST, position 3 is O, which is a vowel position.\n\nSimilarly, in TRUST, position 3 is U, another vowel.\n\nSince we have no vowels except possibly O or U, testing a word with O or U is good.\n\nWe also have S in position 4, which is fixed.\n\nNow, for the third guess, I think FROST is a good choice because it tests F, O, T.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose TRUST, it tests T and U.\n\nBut FROST has three new letters: F, O, T.\n\nGROSS has G and O, but S is repeated, so less information.\n\nDROSS has D and O.\n\nTRUSS has T and U, but S repeated.\n\nSo FROST seems best: new letters F, O, T.\n\nGuess: FROST\n\nBut let\'s see the pattern: _ R _ S _\n\nIf we guess FROST, it is F R O S T.\n\nIf it\'s correct, great. If not, we get feedback on F, O, T.\n\nFor example, if O is in the word but wrong position, or not, etc.\n\nSimilarly for T.\n\nSo I think FROST is a solid choice.\n\nWe could choose a word with more unique letters, but FROST has all unique.\n\nAnother word: PROUD, but no S in fourth.\n\nNot.\n\nSo I\'ll go with FROST.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)  \n  - R is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 2.  \n  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: brisk** → B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)  \n  - R is confirmed in position 2 (as expected).  \n  - S is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 4.  \n  - B, I, K are not in the word.  \n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- The secret word has the form: ** _ R _ S _** (position 2 is R, position 4 is S).  \n- Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, E, B, I, K** (not in the word).  \n- Available letters for positions 1, 3, and 5: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n- Key strategy for the next guess:  \n  - Must have R in position 2 and S in position 4 to maintain known positions.  \n  - Avoid eliminated letters.  \n  - Test new common letters to gather more information, especially focusing on untested vowels (O, U) and frequent consonants (T, F, G, etc.).  \n  - Prioritize words with unique letters to maximize information gain.  \n\n### Why ""frost"" is a good guess:\n- Fits the pattern: **F R O S T** (position 1: F, position 2: R, position 3: O, position 4: S, position 5: T).  \n- Tests three new common letters:  \n  - **F**: A frequent consonant not yet tested.  \n  - **O**: An untested vowel (since A, E, I are eliminated, O is a likely candidate).  \n  - **T**: A very common consonant, often in word endings.  \n- Avoids eliminated letters and repeats.  \n- If incorrect, the feedback will provide information on F, O, and T (e.g., if O is in the word but in the wrong position, or if F/T are present or absent), which will significantly narrow down possibilities for the next guess.\n\n<guess>frost</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: brisk -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)\nGuess 3: frost -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
- R is in the correct position (2).
- C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: brisk -> B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)
- R is correct in position 2.
- S is correct in position 4.
- B, I, K are not in the word.

Guess 3: frost -> F(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) T(✓)
- R is still correct in position 2.
- S is still correct in position 4.
- T is now marked as ✓ in position 5? Let's confirm: ""frost"" is F-R-O-S-T, so positions: 
  Position 1: F (x) means F is not in the word.
  Position 2: R (✓) correct position.
  Position 3: O (x) not in the word? But O(x) means O is not in the word at all? The symbol is ""x"", meaning the letter is not in the word.
  Position 4: S (✓) correct.
  Position 5: T (✓) means T is in the word and in the correct position (5th).

So, from feedback:
- O is not in the word (x) because it's marked with x.
- F is not in the word (x).
- T is in the correct position (5th).

Therefore, new information:
- T is in the word and correctly placed in position 5.
- F and O are not in the word.
- O is eliminated: since it was in position 3 and marked x, meaning it's not in the word at all.

So now, the secret word pattern is: _ R _ S T

Because:
- Position 2: R (known)
- Position 4: S (known)
- Position 5: T (now known)

And we have positions 1 and 3 unknown.

Eliminated letters: From guess 1: C, A, N, E; guess 2: B, I, K; guess 3: F, O.

So eliminated: A, B, C, E, F, I, K, N, O.

We must avoid these letters.

Available letters: D, G, H, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but no vowels left except U and Y? O is out, so vowels are U, and sometimes Y).

The word must end with ""S T"", and have R in second position.

So positions: 1: ?, 2: R, 3: ?, 4: S, 5: T.

We need a 5-letter word: X R Y S T, where Y is position 3.

Available letters for position 1 and 3: D, G, H, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since position 3 can be a vowel, possible vowels left: U, Y.

Position 1 is typically a consonant.

Possible words:

- TRUST? But T is in position 5, and in TRUST it would be position 1 T and position 5 T. But T is only one T? We have T in position 5, so position 1 cannot be T? Not necessarily; there could be two Ts.

In feedback for frost: T in position 5 is marked ✓, but that doesn't say anything about another T.

Similarly, in guess 3, F and O are eliminated.

But TRUST has T in position 1: T-R-U-S-T.

But we have eliminated letters? U is not eliminated, and S,T,R are already present.

But is U available? Yes.

So TRUST: positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:U, 4:S, 5:T.

But we know position 5 is T, so it fits.

However, position 1 is T: is T allowed? T is not eliminated; we know T is in the word, but it's in position 5. It could be that the word has another T.

Similarly, other words.

But we need to see possible words fitting the pattern.

Another word: WORST? W-O-R-S-T, but O is eliminated, so no.

WORST has O in position 2? W-O-R-ST, position 2 is O? But our pattern is _ R _ S T, so position 2 must be R. WORST has O R? No: W-O-R-S-T, so positions: 1:W, 2:O, 3:R, 4:S, 5:T – not matching, since position 2 is O, not R.

Our word has position 2 fixed as R.

So better: TRUST: T-R-U-S-T – fits the pattern: position 1:T, 2:R, 3:U, 4:S, 5:T.

Another one: GRUST? Not a word.

BRUST? Not a word.

CRUST: But C eliminated.

PRUST? Not word.

DRUST? Not word.

RUST? Not 5 letters.

Must be 5 letters.

Another common word: TRUST is one.

WREST? W-R-E-S-T, E is eliminated.

Not.

PREST? P-R-E-S-T, E eliminated.

Not.

Maybe: MOIST? But M-O-I-S-T, I eliminated and position 2 is O, not R.

Not pattern.

Focus on words: X R Y S T.

With Y in position 3.

Possible words:

- TRUST: T R U S T
- GRUMP? But ends with P, not S T.
- DRUMS? But ends with S, not S T.

Our word ends with ST.

List of 5-letter words ending with ""ST"" and second letter R.

But we have position 4 S and 5 T, so it ends with ""ST"".

But position 4 S and 5 T, so the word ends with S T, like frost, trust, etc.

Words: FROST we tried, O and F eliminated.

Other common words: CRUST eliminated C.

RUST? Not 5 letters.

Maybe: HORST? H-O-R-S-T, but position 2 is O? H O R S T, position 2 O, not R.

Not.

VIRST? Not word.

So trust is the most common.

Another: WREST? No, position.

Perhaps WORST, but position 2 O.

No.

Words like ""urst"" but not.

Perhaps ""THRST""? Not word, missing vowel.

Position 3 needs a vowel.

Possible vowels: U or Y.

So words:
- TRUST: T R U S T
- TRYST: T R Y S T? T-R-Y-S-T, that could be: letters T,R,Y,S,T – S and T correct positions, R position 2, position 3 Y.

Y is a vowel sometimes.

TRYST is a word.

And Y not tested.

URGH? Not.

Another: PRYST? Not word.

So possible candidates: TRUST or TRYST.

First, TRUST: T-R-U-S-T

We know position 5 is T, so T is present. Position 1 could be another T.

But we need to see if U is possible.

Similarly, TRYST: T-R-Y-S-T

Y could be the vowel.

But we have eliminated letters? U and Y are not eliminated.

In TRUST, position 3 U.

In TRYST, position 3 Y.

Which to choose? We should test U or Y.

But with one guess, we might solve.

We have only one unknown position? Positions: we have 1 and 3 unknown.

For TRUST: position 1 and 3 to be filled.

But we know position 1 could be T? In TRUST, position 1 is T, position 3 is U.

Similarly, for TRYST, position 1 T, position 3 Y.

But is there a word with different position 1?

For example, could position 1 be G? GRUST not word.

H? HRUST not word.

D? DRUST not word.

P? PRUST not word.

W? WRUST not word.

Perhaps ONLY trust and tryst are common words.

Also, GROST? Not word.

FROST was tried.

Another possibility: first position might not be T.

For example, can position 1 be D? DREST? But E eliminated.

DRAFT? No S T ending.

We must have position 4 S and 5 T.

So the only common words ending with * R * S T are TRUST and TRYST.

Also, perhaps WREST, but W-R-E-S-T, E eliminated.

No.

URST isn't a thing.

So very few possibilities: TRUST and TRYST.

But TRYST is less common.

We can try TRUST.

In feedback from guess 3, T is in position 5 and marked correct, but if TRUST has T in position 1, it might be correct or not.

If we guess TRUST, if it's correct, done; if not, feedback will show.

But perhaps save a guess by testing letters.

But we have only two positions, position 1 and position 3.

Position 3 must be a vowel-like letter, likely U or Y.

Since O and I are out, U and Y are possible.

Word: TRUST or TRYST.

To decide, note that in guess 3, frost: we had O tested and invalid, but U hasn't been tested.

Similarly, Y hasn't been tested.

We can make a guess that tests U specifically.

But since TRUST is a valid word, we can guess it directly.

Perhaps there is another word: BRUST? Not common.

CRUFT? Not S T.

So I think TRUST is the best guess.

If we guess TRUST, it might be the word.

Or not.

But let's see: if TRUST is not the word, then we get feedback.

For example, if position 1 T is wrong or something.

But in TRUST: positions 1,2,3,4,5: T R U S T

We know:
- Position 2 R ✓
- Position 4 S ✓
- Position 5 T ✓

So for position 1 T and position 3 U.

If we guess TRUST, and if the word is TRUST, then all correct.

If not, suppose position 1 is not T, then T might be wrong.

But we know T is in position 5, so if position 1 is T, it might be another T.

In feedback from frost: T was only in position 5, but that doesn't mean there cannot be another T.

Similarly, in secret word, there could be multiple Ts.

For example, TRUST has two Ts.

Similarly, TRYST has two Ts.

So possible.

To confirm, we can look for other words ending with ST, second letter R, and position 3 a valid letter.

Another word: GROUTS? But ending S, not ST? G-R-O-U-T-S? No, 6 letters.

Short list: trust or tryst.

Perhaps ""PREST"" but E out.

So TRUST is a word.

Guess TRUST.

But we haven't tested U, so if we guess TRUST, and U is wrong, we get U(x), then we know to try Y.

But since we have guesses left, it's fine.

We could guess a word that uses U without T in position 1, to test U independently? But that might be hard.

For example, guess: CRUMP? Not ending ST.

Must fit the known letters.

The only practical choices are TRUST or TRYST.

TRYST: T R Y S T

Y might be possible.

But TRUST is more common.

In Wordle, TRUST is a possible word.

So I think we should guess TRUST.

Based on the pattern and eliminated letters.

From feedback: we know T is in position 5, S in 4, R in 2.

So word is _ R _ S T

Position 1 and 3 unknown.

Since we have no U tested, and U is a common vowel.

Let's guess TRUST.

In the response, if we get U correct or not.

If not, next guess TRYST.

But we can do it in this guess.

Since position 5 is T, and we are guessing position 1 T, if wrong, we know position 1 is different.

But let's proceed.

So guess: TRUST

Remember the format.

Think step by step.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Thought Process

With the feedback from all three guesses, here's what we know:

- **Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)**:
  - R is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 2.
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.
  
- **Guess 2: brisk → B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)**:
  - R is confirmed in position 2 (as before).
  - S is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 4.
  - B, I, K are not in the word.
  
- **Guess 3: frost → F(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) T(✓)**:
  - R is still correct in position 2.
  - S is still correct in position 4.
  - T is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 5.
  - F and O are not in the word.

### Summary of Known Information:
- **Secret word pattern**: Position 2 is R, position 4 is S, position 5 is T. So the word must be: _ R _ S T (unknown positions: 1 and 3).
- **Eliminated letters**: A, B, C, E, F, I, K, N, O (these cannot appear in the word).
- **Available letters for positions 1 and 3**: D, G, H, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since common vowels A, E, I, O are out, position 3 must likely be U or Y, or a consonant).
- **Possible words**: Given the pattern _ S T with R fixed, common English words include:
  - TRUST (T R U S T)
  - TRYST (T R Y S T)
  - Less common/niche words may exist, but TRUST and TRYST are the most likely candidates.
- **Strategy for this guess**:
  - Since only positions 1 and 3 are unknown, and we have limited guesses left (3 tries remaining), it's efficient to test one of the plausible words directly.
  - TRUST is a common word that uses U (an untested vowel) and includes T in position 1 (which is possible since T is already confirmed at position 5—there could be another T).
  - Guessing TRUST tests U specifically. If correct, we solve it; if incorrect, feedback will indicate if U is present and help refine the next guess (e.g., try TRYST or consider other words like DRUSY, though none are common).
  - TRYST could be an alternative, but TRUST is prioritized as it's more frequently used, and U is a more common vowel than Y in this position.

Therefore, the next guess is **TRUST**.

<guess>trust</guess>",trust,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
- R is in the correct position (2).
- C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: brisk -> B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)
- R is correct in position 2.
- S is correct in position 4.
- B, I, K are not in the word.

Guess 3: frost -> F(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) T(✓)
- R is still correct in position 2.
- S is still correct in position 4.
- T is now marked as ✓ in position 5? Let's confirm: ""frost"" is F-R-O-S-T, so positions: 
  Position 1: F (x) means F is not in the word.
  Position 2: R (✓) correct position.
  Position 3: O (x) not in the word? But O(x) means O is not in the word at all? The symbol is ""x"", meaning the letter is not in the word.
  Position 4: S (✓) correct.
  Position 5: T (✓) means T is in the word and in the correct position (5th).

So, from feedback:
- O is not in the word (x) because it's marked with x.
- F is not in the word (x).
- T is in the correct position (5th).

Therefore, new information:
- T is in the word and correctly placed in position 5.
- F and O are not in the word.
- O is eliminated: since it was in position 3 and marked x, meaning it's not in the word at all.

So now, the secret word pattern is: _ R _ S T

Because:
- Position 2: R (known)
- Position 4: S (known)
- Position 5: T (now known)

And we have positions 1 and 3 unknown.

Eliminated letters: From guess 1: C, A, N, E; guess 2: B, I, K; guess 3: F, O.

So eliminated: A, B, C, E, F, I, K, N, O.

We must avoid these letters.

Available letters: D, G, H, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but no vowels left except U and Y? O is out, so vowels are U, and sometimes Y).

The word must end with ""S T"", and have R in second position.

So positions: 1: ?, 2: R, 3: ?, 4: S, 5: T.

We need a 5-letter word: X R Y S T, where Y is position 3.

Available letters for position 1 and 3: D, G, H, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since position 3 can be a vowel, possible vowels left: U, Y.

Position 1 is typically a consonant.

Possible words:

- TRUST? But T is in position 5, and in TRUST it would be position 1 T and position 5 T. But T is only one T? We have T in position 5, so position 1 cannot be T? Not necessarily; there could be two Ts.

In feedback for frost: T in position 5 is marked ✓, but that doesn't say anything about another T.

Similarly, in guess 3, F and O are eliminated.

But TRUST has T in position 1: T-R-U-S-T.

But we have eliminated letters? U is not eliminated, and S,T,R are already present.

But is U available? Yes.

So TRUST: positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:U, 4:S, 5:T.

But we know position 5 is T, so it fits.

However, position 1 is T: is T allowed? T is not eliminated; we know T is in the word, but it's in position 5. It could be that the word has another T.

Similarly, other words.

But we need to see possible words fitting the pattern.

Another word: WORST? W-O-R-S-T, but O is eliminated, so no.

WORST has O in position 2? W-O-R-ST, position 2 is O? But our pattern is _ R _ S T, so position 2 must be R. WORST has O R? No: W-O-R-S-T, so positions: 1:W, 2:O, 3:R, 4:S, 5:T – not matching, since position 2 is O, not R.

Our word has position 2 fixed as R.

So better: TRUST: T-R-U-S-T – fits the pattern: position 1:T, 2:R, 3:U, 4:S, 5:T.

Another one: GRUST? Not a word.

BRUST? Not a word.

CRUST: But C eliminated.

PRUST? Not word.

DRUST? Not word.

RUST? Not 5 letters.

Must be 5 letters.

Another common word: TRUST is one.

WREST? W-R-E-S-T, E is eliminated.

Not.

PREST? P-R-E-S-T, E eliminated.

Not.

Maybe: MOIST? But M-O-I-S-T, I eliminated and position 2 is O, not R.

Not pattern.

Focus on words: X R Y S T.

With Y in position 3.

Possible words:

- TRUST: T R U S T
- GRUMP? But ends with P, not S T.
- DRUMS? But ends with S, not S T.

Our word ends with ST.

List of 5-letter words ending with ""ST"" and second letter R.

But we have position 4 S and 5 T, so it ends with ""ST"".

But position 4 S and 5 T, so the word ends with S T, like frost, trust, etc.

Words: FROST we tried, O and F eliminated.

Other common words: CRUST eliminated C.

RUST? Not 5 letters.

Maybe: HORST? H-O-R-S-T, but position 2 is O? H O R S T, position 2 O, not R.

Not.

VIRST? Not word.

So trust is the most common.

Another: WREST? No, position.

Perhaps WORST, but position 2 O.

No.

Words like ""urst"" but not.

Perhaps ""THRST""? Not word, missing vowel.

Position 3 needs a vowel.

Possible vowels: U or Y.

So words:
- TRUST: T R U S T
- TRYST: T R Y S T? T-R-Y-S-T, that could be: letters T,R,Y,S,T – S and T correct positions, R position 2, position 3 Y.

Y is a vowel sometimes.

TRYST is a word.

And Y not tested.

URGH? Not.

Another: PRYST? Not word.

So possible candidates: TRUST or TRYST.

First, TRUST: T-R-U-S-T

We know position 5 is T, so T is present. Position 1 could be another T.

But we need to see if U is possible.

Similarly, TRYST: T-R-Y-S-T

Y could be the vowel.

But we have eliminated letters? U and Y are not eliminated.

In TRUST, position 3 U.

In TRYST, position 3 Y.

Which to choose? We should test U or Y.

But with one guess, we might solve.

We have only one unknown position? Positions: we have 1 and 3 unknown.

For TRUST: position 1 and 3 to be filled.

But we know position 1 could be T? In TRUST, position 1 is T, position 3 is U.

Similarly, for TRYST, position 1 T, position 3 Y.

But is there a word with different position 1?

For example, could position 1 be G? GRUST not word.

H? HRUST not word.

D? DRUST not word.

P? PRUST not word.

W? WRUST not word.

Perhaps ONLY trust and tryst are common words.

Also, GROST? Not word.

FROST was tried.

Another possibility: first position might not be T.

For example, can position 1 be D? DREST? But E eliminated.

DRAFT? No S T ending.

We must have position 4 S and 5 T.

So the only common words ending with * R * S T are TRUST and TRYST.

Also, perhaps WREST, but W-R-E-S-T, E eliminated.

No.

URST isn't a thing.

So very few possibilities: TRUST and TRYST.

But TRYST is less common.

We can try TRUST.

In feedback from guess 3, T is in position 5 and marked correct, but if TRUST has T in position 1, it might be correct or not.

If we guess TRUST, if it's correct, done; if not, feedback will show.

But perhaps save a guess by testing letters.

But we have only two positions, position 1 and position 3.

Position 3 must be a vowel-like letter, likely U or Y.

Since O and I are out, U and Y are possible.

Word: TRUST or TRYST.

To decide, note that in guess 3, frost: we had O tested and invalid, but U hasn't been tested.

Similarly, Y hasn't been tested.

We can make a guess that tests U specifically.

But since TRUST is a valid word, we can guess it directly.

Perhaps there is another word: BRUST? Not common.

CRUFT? Not S T.

So I think TRUST is the best guess.

If we guess TRUST, it might be the word.

Or not.

But let's see: if TRUST is not the word, then we get feedback.

For example, if position 1 T is wrong or something.

But in TRUST: positions 1,2,3,4,5: T R U S T

We know:
- Position 2 R ✓
- Position 4 S ✓
- Position 5 T ✓

So for position 1 T and position 3 U.

If we guess TRUST, and if the word is TRUST, then all correct.

If not, suppose position 1 is not T, then T might be wrong.

But we know T is in position 5, so if position 1 is T, it might be another T.

In feedback from frost: T was only in position 5, but that doesn't mean there cannot be another T.

Similarly, in secret word, there could be multiple Ts.

For example, TRUST has two Ts.

Similarly, TRYST has two Ts.

So possible.

To confirm, we can look for other words ending with ST, second letter R, and position 3 a valid letter.

Another word: GROUTS? But ending S, not ST? G-R-O-U-T-S? No, 6 letters.

Short list: trust or tryst.

Perhaps ""PREST"" but E out.

So TRUST is a word.

Guess TRUST.

But we haven't tested U, so if we guess TRUST, and U is wrong, we get U(x), then we know to try Y.

But since we have guesses left, it's fine.

We could guess a word that uses U without T in position 1, to test U independently? But that might be hard.

For example, guess: CRUMP? Not ending ST.

Must fit the known letters.

The only practical choices are TRUST or TRYST.

TRYST: T R Y S T

Y might be possible.

But TRUST is more common.

In Wordle, TRUST is a possible word.

So I think we should guess TRUST.

Based on the pattern and eliminated letters.

From feedback: we know T is in position 5, S in 4, R in 2.

So word is _ R _ S T

Position 1 and 3 unknown.

Since we have no U tested, and U is a common vowel.

Let's guess TRUST.

In the response, if we get U correct or not.

If not, next guess TRYST.

But we can do it in this guess.

Since position 5 is T, and we are guessing position 1 T, if wrong, we know position 1 is different.

But let's proceed.

So guess: TRUST

Remember the format.

Think step by step.### Step-by-Step Thought Process

With the feedback from all three guesses, here's what we know:

- **Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)**:
  - R is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 2.
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.
  
- **Guess 2: brisk → B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)**:
  - R is confirmed in position 2 (as before).
  - S is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 4.
  - B, I, K are not in the word.
  
- **Guess 3: frost → F(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) T(✓)**:
  - R is still correct in position 2.
  - S is still correct in position 4.
  - T is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 5.
  - F and O are not in the word.

### Summary of Known Information:
- **Secret word pattern**: Position 2 is R, position 4 is S, position 5 is T. So the word must be: _ R _ S T (unknown positions: 1 and 3).
- **Eliminated letters**: A, B, C, E, F, I, K, N, O (these cannot appear in the word).
- **Available letters for positions 1 and 3**: D, G, H, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since common vowels A, E, I, O are out, position 3 must likely be U or Y, or a consonant).
- **Possible words**: Given the pattern _ S T with R fixed, common English words include:
  - TRUST (T R U S T)
  - TRYST (T R Y S T)
  - Less common/niche words may exist, but TRUST and TRYST are the most likely candidates.
- **Strategy for this guess**:
  - Since only positions 1 and 3 are unknown, and we have limited guesses left (3 tries remaining), it's efficient to test one of the plausible words directly.
  - TRUST is a common word that uses U (an untested vowel) and includes T in position 1 (which is possible since T is already confirmed at position 5—there could be another T).

  - TRYST could be an alternative, but TRUST is prioritized as it's more frequently used, and U is a more common vowel than Y in this position.

Therefore, the next guess is **TRUST**.",Guess 4: trust -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(✓) U(x) S(✓) T(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,tryst,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>First, I have the feedback from Guess 1: CRANE → C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)

This means:
- R is in the secret word and it's in the correct position (position 2).
- C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has R as the second letter, and it does not contain C, A, N, or E.

Since R is in position 2, the word looks like: _ R _ _ _

Now, I need to make a second guess. I should choose a word that:
1. Has R in the second position again, to confirm or get more clues.
2. Avoids the letters C, A, N, E since they're not in the word.
3. Includes other common vowels or consonants to test for presence.

Common vowels left are: O, I, U (since A and E are out). But E is out, so vowels to try could be O, I, U.

Consonants: Avoid C, N; common ones like S, T, L, etc. might be good.

Since A and E are not in the word, the word might have different vowels, like O, I, U, or even Y.

Possible letters to include in the guess: S, T, L, O, I, U, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, etc.

I should aim for a word with R in the second position and new letters to test.

A good strategy is to test more vowels or frequent consonants.

Let me think of some words that start with a consonant, have R second, and end with something.

Common words: Words like BRIX? No, not common; better to use real words.

Examples:
- TRYST: But that has E? No, TRYST is T-R-Y-S-T. Positions: T? R? Y? S? T.

But I need R in second position.

So, let's list words that have the second letter as R.

Some options:
- BRIGHT: But B-R-I-G-H-T, but that's 6 letters. Wordle is 5-letter words.
- 5-letter words: Like BROKE, but O and E; E is out, so avoid E.
- O could be possible since A and E are out.

Available letters: No C, A, N, E.

Common words:
- PROUD: P-R-O-U-D → R in second.
- But U and O are vowels to test.
- GROWN: G-R-O-W-N → has N? N is out! N is not in the word, so avoid N.

N is invalid, so GROWN has N, which can't be in the word.

So avoid letters: C, A, N, E.

Letters to include: Possibly S, T, L, O, I, etc.

Another word: PRISM: P-R-I-S-M → R in second, with P, I, S, M.

I is a vowel to test, S is a common consonant.

INPUT: I-N-P-U-T, but N is out and second letter is N? No.

Need second letter R.

So P-R-I-S-M seems good: positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), M(5).

This uses P, I, S, M, all new except R.

I could use T instead: TRIPS? T-R-I-P-S → S might be duplicated, but it's fine.

TRIPS has R in second position.

But let's consider the feedback: so far, only R is correct and in place.

Secret word is _ R _ _ _

Possible letters for other positions.

Another common starting point: since CRANE is used, and R is known, perhaps try SHIRT or something, but SHIRT has T.

S-H-I-R-T, but R is third position, not second. I need R in second position in my guess.

So words like BROOK, but has O and K; BROOK is B-R-O-O-K.

O is repeated, might be okay, but O could be tested.

Better to cover more letters.

List of possible 5-letter words with R in second position: 
- BRICK, but C is out.
- BRISK, that could be; B-R-I-S-K, letters B,I,S,K all possible.
- DRINK, D-R-I-N-K, has N, out.
- FRUIT, F-R-U-I-T, no E,A, but U and I.
- GRASP, G-R-A-S-P, A is out.
- PRICE, P-R-I-C-E, C and E out.

PRICE has C and E, both eliminated.

PRISM: P-R-I-S-M, letters P,I,S,M. S is common.

Other options: TRULY: T-R-U-L-Y, U and Y vowels.

ORBIT: O-R-B-I-T, R in second.

ORBIT is O-R-B-I-T, so positions: O, R, B, I, T.

But O is first letter, not using the R position as efficiently? No, R is second, good.

In my guess, I can have different first letters since R is fixed in position.

So ORBIT could be a good guess: it has O, B, I, T, all new except R.

Similarly, URBAN: U-R-B-A-N, but A and N are out, invalid.

URBAN has A and N, both eliminated.

So not good.

GRIMY: G-R-I-M-Y, letters G,I,M,Y.

G and Y might be less common.

I should prioritize common letters like S, T, L.

So back to PRISM: P-R-I-S-M.

Another one: CRISP, but CRISP has C, and C is out, so no.

C is first letter, but C is not in word, so CRISP wouldn't work.

C-R-I-S-P, but C is out.

Similarly, TRAPS: T-R-A-P-S, but A is out.

So avoid A.

DROPS: D-R-O-P-S, has O, P, S.

DROPS is D-R-O-P-S, no eliminated letters.

D-R-O-P-S, letters D,O,P,S.

D and P might be less frequent, but S is good.

SPRITE: S-P-R-I-T-E, 6 letters? SPRIT is not common; SPRITE is 6 letters. Better to stick to 5.

5-letter: SPROG? Not common.

Better words: ORBIS? Not common.

USUAL: U-S-U-A-L, R not second.

Need R second.

STRIP: S-T-R-I-P, R is third position! S-T-R, so R is third, but I need R in second for this guess? No.

In my guess, since I know R is fixed in position 2, I should keep it there to confirm and test other positions.

So in guess 2, I should have R in the second position again to verify or get more feedback on other letters.

Thus, word like X R Y Z W, where X,Y,Z,W are new letters, excluding C,A,N,E.

Possible words:
- BROIL: B-R-O-I-L, letters B,O,I,L
- GROWL: G-R-O-W-L, has W,L
- PROWL: P-R-O-W-L
- TRAIN: T-R-A-I-N, A and N out, invalid.
- FROND: F-R-O-N-D, N out.
- GRIND: G-R-I-N-D, N out.

So, B R something.

BRISK: B-R-I-S-K, as I thought earlier.

PRISM: P-R-I-S-M

DRUID: D-R-U-I-D, U and D, but D repeated? It's okay, letters D,U,I.

I and U vowels.

TRIPE: T-R-I-P-E, E out.

Not good.

BRICK: B-R-I-C-K, C out.

So PRISM seems fine: P-R-I-S-M

Similarly, TRIMS: T-R-I-M-S, but S could be last.

Another one: HORDE, H-O-R-D-E, R is third position; not second.

I need R to be second letter.

PERSU? Not common.

Perhaps URBEX? Not English.

Stick to common words.

Another common word: BRIDE, B-R-I-D-E, but E is out.

B R I D E, E eliminated.

So, BROOD: B-R-O-O-D, O repeated.

Not efficient.

GROUT: G-R-O-U-T, letters G,O,U,T.

U and O vowels to test.

PRONG: P-R-O-N-G, N out.

FORUM: F-O-R-U-M, R is third position.

F O R U M, position: F(1), O(2), R(3) – not second.

To have R second, it should be _ R _ _ _

So many words: LIKE BRASH, but BRASH: B-R-A-S-H, A out.

SHARD: S-H-A-R-D, A out and R third.

CURED: C-U-R-E-D, C and E out.

So better: PRISM (P-R-I-S-M) or BRISK (B-R-I-S-K)

BRISK seems common and good: B-R-I-S-K.

Letters: B, I, S, K – all possible.

Similarly, PRISM: P, I, S, M.

B, P, S are consonants; I is vowel.

S is very common, so including S might be helpful.

CRISP is out due to C.

Another word: TRUCK, T-R-U-C-K, C out.

So not.

GLORY: G-L-O-R-Y, R fourth.

I think BRISK or PRISM are fine.

Let me choose BRISK: it's a common Wordle word.

So guess: BRISK

But let's confirm: B-R-I-S-K

In the feedback, I can see which of B, I, S, K are in the word and where.

If I get feedback, I might identify the word faster.

PRISM might be equally good.

I recall that in Wordle, words like STOMP or SLATE are common, but with R fixed.

Since A and E are out, vowels are likely O, I, U or Y.

BRISK has I.

PRISM also has I.

But PRISM has M which is less common; BRISK has K which is common.

K is common in endings.

BRISK ends with K.

But let's pick one.

I'll go with BRISK for the second guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)

- R is confirmed to be in the secret word and in the correct position (second letter). So the secret word has the form _ R _ _ _.
- C, A, N, and E are eliminated; they are not in the secret word.

For the second guess:
- The word must have R in the second position to leverage the known correct position.
- It should avoid C, A, N, E entirely.
- It should include new common letters to maximize information gain, such as testing other vowels (e.g., I, O, U) or frequent consonants (e.g., B, S, K, T).
- Considering above, ""brisk"" is a good choice: B-R-I-S-K. This tests B, I, S, and K, all new letters not eliminated.

Guess: brisk  
Expected format:

- ✓ : correct letter in correct position
- - : letter in word but wrong position
- x : letter not in word

In guess 2: B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)

So:
- B is not in the word (x)
- R is correct and in position 2 (✓)
- I is not in the word (x)
- S is correct and in position 4? Because S is the 4th letter in ""brisk"", and it has ✓, so S is in the word and in the correct position (4th).
- K is not in the word (x)

Therefore, from guess 2:
- S is in the word and in the 4th position.
- B, I, K are not in the word.

Also, from guess 1, we know C, A, N, E are not in the word.

So now we know:
- The secret word has R in position 2 and S in position 4.
- So the word is: _ R _ S _
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, B, I, K

We need to find a word that fits _ R _ S _

Available letters: We must avoid C, A, N, E, B, I, K.

Common letters left: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but some are less common).

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5.

Position 1: can be a consonant or vowel? Since A, E, I are out, possible vowels are O, U, and sometimes Y.

Position 3: same, can be a consonant or vowel.

Position 5: typically a consonant, but can be a vowel or Y.

We should choose a word that tests common remaining letters to narrow down possibilities.

Possible words: Let's think of 5-letter words with second letter R, fourth letter S.

Examples:
- TRUST: T R U S T -> but T is in position 1 and 5? We don't know if T is in the word.
- GROWS: G R O W S -> but S is in position 5, not 4. We need S in position 4.
- We need _ R _ S _, so third letter can be anything, and then S in fourth.

More examples:
- PRESS: P R E S S -> but E is eliminated, so no.
- CROSS: C is eliminated.
- DRESS: D R E S S -> E eliminated.
- GRASS: G R A S S -> A eliminated.
- TRUSS: T R U S S -> this could be, letters T, R, U, S, S. S is repeated, but that's okay. Position: T(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), S(5). But we have S in position 4, and position 5 is also S? The word is T R U S S.

But we have S in position 4, which is correct, and position 5 is S, which might be okay if the word has two S's? But in feedback, for guess 2, S was in position 4 and marked correct, but we don't know if there is another S.

In ""brisk"", S was in position 4 and marked ✓, meaning it is correct and in position. But the secret word has S in position 4, and it might have another S elsewhere? We don't know.

But in TRUSS, it has S in position 4 and 5, so if we guess it, we might get information.

But let's list possible words without eliminated letters.

Eliminated: A, B, C, E, I, K, N

So available: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Now, words of form _ R _ S _

Possible:
- DRUMS: D R U M S -> S is in position 5, not 4. We need S in position 4, so the word must have the fourth letter S.
- So the pattern is: position 1: ?, position 2: R, position 3: ?, position 4: S, position 5: ?

So for example:
- TRUMP: T R U M P -> but no S? Position 4 is M, not S. Not matching.
- We need position 4 to be S.

So:
- Words like: PRISM, but we used that? No, we didn't use PRISM, but in guess 2 we used BRISK, which has S in position 4? BRISK is B-R-I-S-K, so position 4 is S, and it was correct.

But PRISM is P-R-I-S-M, which has I, and I is eliminated now, so we can't use PRISM because I is not in the word.

Similarly, other words.

List of possible words with _ R _ S _ and no A,B,C,E,I,K,N.

For position 1: possible letters: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Position 3: same set.

Position 5: same set.

Common words:
- FROST: F R O S T -> position 4 is S? F-R-O-S-T, so position 1:F, 2:R, 3:O, 4:S, 5:T. And O and T are not eliminated. So FROST is a candidate.
- PROST: not a word, usually.
- GROSS: G R O S S -> position 4 is S, position 5 is S. G and O available.
- TROSS: not common.
- CROSS: C eliminated.
- DROSS: D R O S S -> D and O available.
- PROSE: P R O S E -> but E is eliminated.
- VERSE: V E R S E, E eliminated and R position wrong.
- WORSE: W O R S E, E eliminated.
- PURSE: P U R S E, E eliminated.
- HORSE: H O R S E, E eliminated.
- TRUSS: T R U S S -> T and U available.
- GRUMP: no S.
- DRUMS: position 5 S, not 4.
- TRUMP: no S.
- FRUMP: not common, and no S in 4th.
- PRESS: E eliminated.

So possible candidates: FROST, GROSS, DROSS, TRUSS.

Also, others:
- WREST: W R E S T, E eliminated.
- CRUST: C eliminated.
- TRUST: T R U S T -> position 4 is S? T-R-U-S-T, so position 1:T, 2:R, 3:U, 4:S, 5:T. T is repeated. And U available. So TRUST is a candidate.
- GRASP: A eliminated.
- CLASP: C and A eliminated.

Another one: PROWS? P R O W S, S in position 5, not 4.

So main candidates: FROST, GROSS, DROSS, TRUST, TRUSS.

DROSS: D-R-O-S-S, so positions: D(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), S(5)

GROSS: G(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), S(5)

FROST: F(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), T(5)

TRUST: T(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), T(5)

TRUSS: T(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), S(5)

We need to choose one that tests new letters.

We have not tested: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But O and T are in multiple candidates.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that has letters not in the candidates, but we need to solve.

Since we have only three positions to guess, and we know two letters, we can try to cover more possibilities.

But we have 6 guesses, so we can be efficient.

Another candidate: PROSY? Not common.

Or TORSO: T O R S O, but R is third position? T-O-R-S-O, position 2 is O, not R. We need R in position 2.

So not.

FOCUS: F O C U S, C eliminated and position wrong.

So back to the list.

We can choose FROST: it has F, O, T which are new.

Similarly, TRUST has T and U.

But in TRUST, T is in position 1 and 5, so if T is not in the word, we eliminate T, but if it is, we might get feedback.

But we don't know if T is in the word.

Similarly for FROST, we test F, O, T.

O is a vowel that hasn't been tested, so it might be good to test O.

In FROST, position 3 is O, which is a vowel position.

Similarly, in TRUST, position 3 is U, another vowel.

Since we have no vowels except possibly O or U, testing a word with O or U is good.

We also have S in position 4, which is fixed.

Now, for the third guess, I think FROST is a good choice because it tests F, O, T.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Similarly, if we choose TRUST, it tests T and U.

But FROST has three new letters: F, O, T.

GROSS has G and O, but S is repeated, so less information.

DROSS has D and O.

TRUSS has T and U, but S repeated.

So FROST seems best: new letters F, O, T.

Guess: FROST

But let's see the pattern: _ R _ S _

If we guess FROST, it is F R O S T.

If it's correct, great. If not, we get feedback on F, O, T.

For example, if O is in the word but wrong position, or not, etc.

Similarly for T.

So I think FROST is a solid choice.

We could choose a word with more unique letters, but FROST has all unique.

Another word: PROUD, but no S in fourth.

Not.

So I'll go with FROST.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
  - R is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 2.  
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: brisk** → B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)  
  - R is confirmed in position 2 (as expected).  
  - S is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 4.  
  - B, I, K are not in the word.  

### Current Knowledge:
- The secret word has the form: ** _ R _ S _** (position 2 is R, position 4 is S).  
- Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, E, B, I, K** (not in the word).  
- Available letters for positions 1, 3, and 5: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
- Key strategy for the next guess:  
  - Must have R in position 2 and S in position 4 to maintain known positions.  
  - Avoid eliminated letters.  
  - Test new common letters to gather more information, especially focusing on untested vowels (O, U) and frequent consonants (T, F, G, etc.).  
  - Prioritize words with unique letters to maximize information gain.  

### Why ""frost"" is a good guess:
- Fits the pattern: **F R O S T** (position 1: F, position 2: R, position 3: O, position 4: S, position 5: T).  
- Tests three new common letters:  
  - **F**: A frequent consonant not yet tested.  
  - **O**: An untested vowel (since A, E, I are eliminated, O is a likely candidate).  
  - **T**: A very common consonant, often in word endings.  
- Avoids eliminated letters and repeats.  
- If incorrect, the feedback will provide information on F, O, and T (e.g., if O is in the word but in the wrong position, or if F/T are present or absent), which will significantly narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

<guess>frost</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: brisk -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)
Guess 3: frost -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) T(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
- R is in the correct position (2).
- C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: brisk -> B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)
- R is correct in position 2.
- S is correct in position 4.
- B, I, K are not in the word.

Guess 3: frost -> F(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) T(✓)
- R is still correct in position 2.
- S is still correct in position 4.
- T is now marked as ✓ in position 5? Let's confirm: ""frost"" is F-R-O-S-T, so positions: 
  Position 1: F (x) means F is not in the word.
  Position 2: R (✓) correct position.
  Position 3: O (x) not in the word? But O(x) means O is not in the word at all? The symbol is ""x"", meaning the letter is not in the word.
  Position 4: S (✓) correct.
  Position 5: T (✓) means T is in the word and in the correct position (5th).

So, from feedback:
- O is not in the word (x) because it's marked with x.
- F is not in the word (x).
- T is in the correct position (5th).

Therefore, new information:
- T is in the word and correctly placed in position 5.
- F and O are not in the word.
- O is eliminated: since it was in position 3 and marked x, meaning it's not in the word at all.

So now, the secret word pattern is: _ R _ S T

Because:
- Position 2: R (known)
- Position 4: S (known)
- Position 5: T (now known)

And we have positions 1 and 3 unknown.

Eliminated letters: From guess 1: C, A, N, E; guess 2: B, I, K; guess 3: F, O.

So eliminated: A, B, C, E, F, I, K, N, O.

We must avoid these letters.

Available letters: D, G, H, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but no vowels left except U and Y? O is out, so vowels are U, and sometimes Y).

The word must end with ""S T"", and have R in second position.

So positions: 1: ?, 2: R, 3: ?, 4: S, 5: T.

We need a 5-letter word: X R Y S T, where Y is position 3.

Available letters for position 1 and 3: D, G, H, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since position 3 can be a vowel, possible vowels left: U, Y.

Position 1 is typically a consonant.

Possible words:

- TRUST? But T is in position 5, and in TRUST it would be position 1 T and position 5 T. But T is only one T? We have T in position 5, so position 1 cannot be T? Not necessarily; there could be two Ts.

In feedback for frost: T in position 5 is marked ✓, but that doesn't say anything about another T.

Similarly, in guess 3, F and O are eliminated.

But TRUST has T in position 1: T-R-U-S-T.

But we have eliminated letters? U is not eliminated, and S,T,R are already present.

But is U available? Yes.

So TRUST: positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:U, 4:S, 5:T.

But we know position 5 is T, so it fits.

However, position 1 is T: is T allowed? T is not eliminated; we know T is in the word, but it's in position 5. It could be that the word has another T.

Similarly, other words.

But we need to see possible words fitting the pattern.

Another word: WORST? W-O-R-S-T, but O is eliminated, so no.

WORST has O in position 2? W-O-R-ST, position 2 is O? But our pattern is _ R _ S T, so position 2 must be R. WORST has O R? No: W-O-R-S-T, so positions: 1:W, 2:O, 3:R, 4:S, 5:T – not matching, since position 2 is O, not R.

Our word has position 2 fixed as R.

So better: TRUST: T-R-U-S-T – fits the pattern: position 1:T, 2:R, 3:U, 4:S, 5:T.

Another one: GRUST? Not a word.

BRUST? Not a word.

CRUST: But C eliminated.

PRUST? Not word.

DRUST? Not word.

RUST? Not 5 letters.

Must be 5 letters.

Another common word: TRUST is one.

WREST? W-R-E-S-T, E is eliminated.

Not.

PREST? P-R-E-S-T, E eliminated.

Not.

Maybe: MOIST? But M-O-I-S-T, I eliminated and position 2 is O, not R.

Not pattern.

Focus on words: X R Y S T.

With Y in position 3.

Possible words:

- TRUST: T R U S T
- GRUMP? But ends with P, not S T.
- DRUMS? But ends with S, not S T.

Our word ends with ST.

List of 5-letter words ending with ""ST"" and second letter R.

But we have position 4 S and 5 T, so it ends with ""ST"".

But position 4 S and 5 T, so the word ends with S T, like frost, trust, etc.

Words: FROST we tried, O and F eliminated.

Other common words: CRUST eliminated C.

RUST? Not 5 letters.

Maybe: HORST? H-O-R-S-T, but position 2 is O? H O R S T, position 2 O, not R.

Not.

VIRST? Not word.

So trust is the most common.

Another: WREST? No, position.

Perhaps WORST, but position 2 O.

No.

Words like ""urst"" but not.

Perhaps ""THRST""? Not word, missing vowel.

Position 3 needs a vowel.

Possible vowels: U or Y.

So words:
- TRUST: T R U S T
- TRYST: T R Y S T? T-R-Y-S-T, that could be: letters T,R,Y,S,T – S and T correct positions, R position 2, position 3 Y.

Y is a vowel sometimes.

TRYST is a word.

And Y not tested.

URGH? Not.

Another: PRYST? Not word.

So possible candidates: TRUST or TRYST.

First, TRUST: T-R-U-S-T

We know position 5 is T, so T is present. Position 1 could be another T.

But we need to see if U is possible.

Similarly, TRYST: T-R-Y-S-T

Y could be the vowel.

But we have eliminated letters? U and Y are not eliminated.

In TRUST, position 3 U.

In TRYST, position 3 Y.

Which to choose? We should test U or Y.

But with one guess, we might solve.

We have only one unknown position? Positions: we have 1 and 3 unknown.

For TRUST: position 1 and 3 to be filled.

But we know position 1 could be T? In TRUST, position 1 is T, position 3 is U.

Similarly, for TRYST, position 1 T, position 3 Y.

But is there a word with different position 1?

For example, could position 1 be G? GRUST not word.

H? HRUST not word.

D? DRUST not word.

P? PRUST not word.

W? WRUST not word.

Perhaps ONLY trust and tryst are common words.

Also, GROST? Not word.

FROST was tried.

Another possibility: first position might not be T.

For example, can position 1 be D? DREST? But E eliminated.

DRAFT? No S T ending.

We must have position 4 S and 5 T.

So the only common words ending with * R * S T are TRUST and TRYST.

Also, perhaps WREST, but W-R-E-S-T, E eliminated.

No.

URST isn't a thing.

So very few possibilities: TRUST and TRYST.

But TRYST is less common.

We can try TRUST.

In feedback from guess 3, T is in position 5 and marked correct, but if TRUST has T in position 1, it might be correct or not.

If we guess TRUST, if it's correct, done; if not, feedback will show.

But perhaps save a guess by testing letters.

But we have only two positions, position 1 and position 3.

Position 3 must be a vowel-like letter, likely U or Y.

Since O and I are out, U and Y are possible.

Word: TRUST or TRYST.

To decide, note that in guess 3, frost: we had O tested and invalid, but U hasn't been tested.

Similarly, Y hasn't been tested.

We can make a guess that tests U specifically.

But since TRUST is a valid word, we can guess it directly.

Perhaps there is another word: BRUST? Not common.

CRUFT? Not S T.

So I think TRUST is the best guess.

If we guess TRUST, it might be the word.

Or not.

But let's see: if TRUST is not the word, then we get feedback.

For example, if position 1 T is wrong or something.

But in TRUST: positions 1,2,3,4,5: T R U S T

We know:
- Position 2 R ✓
- Position 4 S ✓
- Position 5 T ✓

So for position 1 T and position 3 U.

If we guess TRUST, and if the word is TRUST, then all correct.

If not, suppose position 1 is not T, then T might be wrong.

But we know T is in position 5, so if position 1 is T, it might be another T.

In feedback from frost: T was only in position 5, but that doesn't mean there cannot be another T.

Similarly, in secret word, there could be multiple Ts.

For example, TRUST has two Ts.

Similarly, TRYST has two Ts.

So possible.

To confirm, we can look for other words ending with ST, second letter R, and position 3 a valid letter.

Another word: GROUTS? But ending S, not ST? G-R-O-U-T-S? No, 6 letters.

Short list: trust or tryst.

Perhaps ""PREST"" but E out.

So TRUST is a word.

Guess TRUST.

But we haven't tested U, so if we guess TRUST, and U is wrong, we get U(x), then we know to try Y.

But since we have guesses left, it's fine.

We could guess a word that uses U without T in position 1, to test U independently? But that might be hard.

For example, guess: CRUMP? Not ending ST.

Must fit the known letters.

The only practical choices are TRUST or TRYST.

TRYST: T R Y S T

Y might be possible.

But TRUST is more common.

In Wordle, TRUST is a possible word.

So I think we should guess TRUST.

Based on the pattern and eliminated letters.

From feedback: we know T is in position 5, S in 4, R in 2.

So word is _ R _ S T

Position 1 and 3 unknown.

Since we have no U tested, and U is a common vowel.

Let's guess TRUST.

In the response, if we get U correct or not.

If not, next guess TRYST.

But we can do it in this guess.

Since position 5 is T, and we are guessing position 1 T, if wrong, we know position 1 is different.

But let's proceed.

So guess: TRUST

Remember the format.

Think step by step.### Step-by-Step Thought Process

With the feedback from all three guesses, here's what we know:

- **Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)**:
  - R is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 2.
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.
  
- **Guess 2: brisk → B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)**:
  - R is confirmed in position 2 (as before).
  - S is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 4.
  - B, I, K are not in the word.
  
- **Guess 3: frost → F(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) T(✓)**:
  - R is still correct in position 2.
  - S is still correct in position 4.
  - T is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 5.
  - F and O are not in the word.

### Summary of Known Information:
- **Secret word pattern**: Position 2 is R, position 4 is S, position 5 is T. So the word must be: _ R _ S T (unknown positions: 1 and 3).
- **Eliminated letters**: A, B, C, E, F, I, K, N, O (these cannot appear in the word).
- **Available letters for positions 1 and 3**: D, G, H, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since common vowels A, E, I, O are out, position 3 must likely be U or Y, or a consonant).
- **Possible words**: Given the pattern _ S T with R fixed, common English words include:
  - TRUST (T R U S T)
  - TRYST (T R Y S T)
  - Less common/niche words may exist, but TRUST and TRYST are the most likely candidates.
- **Strategy for this guess**:
  - Since only positions 1 and 3 are unknown, and we have limited guesses left (3 tries remaining), it's efficient to test one of the plausible words directly.
  - TRUST is a common word that uses U (an untested vowel) and includes T in position 1 (which is possible since T is already confirmed at position 5—there could be another T).
  - Guessing TRUST tests U specifically. If correct, we solve it; if incorrect, feedback will indicate if U is present and help refine the next guess (e.g., try TRYST or consider other words like DRUSY, though none are common).
  - TRYST could be an alternative, but TRUST is prioritized as it's more frequently used, and U is a more common vowel than Y in this position.

Therefore, the next guess is **TRUST**.

But E is out, so vowels to try could be O, I, U.\n\nConsonants: Avoid C, N; common ones like S, T, L, etc. might be good.\n\nSince A and E are not in the word, the word might have different vowels, like O, I, U, or even Y.\n\nPossible letters to include in the guess: S, T, L, O, I, U, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, etc.\n\nI should aim for a word with R in the second position and new letters to test.\n\nA good strategy is to test more vowels or frequent consonants.\n\nLet me think of some words that start with a consonant, have R second, and end with something.\n\nCommon words: Words like BRIX? No, not common; better to use real words.\n\nExamples:\n- TRYST: But that has E? No, TRYST is T-R-Y-S-T. Positions: T? R? Y? S? T.\n\nBut I need R in second position.\n\nSo, let\'s list words that have the second letter as R.\n\nSome options:\n- BRIGHT: But B-R-I-G-H-T, but that\'s 6 letters. Wordle is 5-letter words.\n- 5-letter words: Like BROKE, but O and E; E is out, so avoid E.\n- O could be possible since A and E are out.\n\nAvailable letters: No C, A, N, E.\n\nCommon words:\n- PROUD: P-R-O-U-D → R in second.\n- But U and O are vowels to test.\n- GROWN: G-R-O-W-N → has N? N is out! N is not in the word, so avoid N.\n\nN is invalid, so GROWN has N, which can\'t be in the word.\n\nSo avoid letters: C, A, N, E.\n\nLetters to include: Possibly S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n\nAnother word: PRISM: P-R-I-S-M → R in second, with P, I, S, M.\n\nI is a vowel to test, S is a common consonant.\n\nINPUT: I-N-P-U-T, but N is out and second letter is N? No.\n\nNeed second letter R.\n\nSo P-R-I-S-M seems good: positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), M(5).\n\nThis uses P, I, S, M, all new except R.\n\nI could use T instead: TRIPS? T-R-I-P-S → S might be duplicated, but it\'s fine.\n\nTRIPS has R in second position.\n\nBut let\'s consider the feedback: so far, only R is correct and in place.\n\nSecret word is _ R _ _ _\n\nPossible letters for other positions.\n\nAnother common starting point: since CRANE is used, and R is known, perhaps try SHIRT or something, but SHIRT has T.\n\nS-H-I-R-T, but R is third position, not second. I need R in second position in my guess.\n\nSo words like BROOK, but has O and K; BROOK is B-R-O-O-K.\n\nO is repeated, might be okay, but O could be tested.\n\nBetter to cover more letters.\n\nList of possible 5-letter words with R in second position: \n- BRICK, but C is out.\n- BRISK, that could be; B-R-I-S-K, letters B,I,S,K all possible.\n- DRINK, D-R-I-N-K, has N, out.\n- FRUIT, F-R-U-I-T, no E,A, but U and I.\n- GRASP, G-R-A-S-P, A is out.\n- PRICE, P-R-I-C-E, C and E out.\n\nPRICE has C and E, both eliminated.\n\nPRISM: P-R-I-S-M, letters P,I,S,M. S is common.\n\nOther options: TRULY: T-R-U-L-Y, U and Y vowels.\n\nORBIT: O-R-B-I-T, R in second.\n\nORBIT is O-R-B-I-T, so positions: O, R, B, I, T.\n\nBut O is first letter, not using the R position as efficiently? No, R is second, good.\n\nIn my guess, I can have different first letters since R is fixed in position.\n\nSo ORBIT could be a good guess: it has O, B, I, T, all new except R.\n\nSimilarly, URBAN: U-R-B-A-N, but A and N are out, invalid.\n\nURBAN has A and N, both eliminated.\n\nSo not good.\n\nGRIMY: G-R-I-M-Y, letters G,I,M,Y.\n\nG and Y might be less common.\n\nI should prioritize common letters like S, T, L.\n\nSo back to PRISM: P-R-I-S-M.\n\nAnother one: CRISP, but CRISP has C, and C is out, so no.\n\nC is first letter, but C is not in word, so CRISP wouldn\'t work.\n\nC-R-I-S-P, but C is out.\n\nSimilarly, TRAPS: T-R-A-P-S, but A is out.\n\nSo avoid A.\n\nDROPS: D-R-O-P-S, has O, P, S.\n\nDROPS is D-R-O-P-S, no eliminated letters.\n\nD-R-O-P-S, letters D,O,P,S.\n\nD and P might be less frequent, but S is good.\n\nSPRITE: S-P-R-I-T-E, 6 letters? SPRIT is not common; SPRITE is 6 letters. Better to stick to 5.\n\n5-letter: SPROG? Not common.\n\nBetter words: ORBIS? Not common.\n\nUSUAL: U-S-U-A-L, R not second.\n\nNeed R second.\n\nSTRIP: S-T-R-I-P, R is third position! S-T-R, so R is third, but I need R in second for this guess? No.\n\nIn my guess, since I know R is fixed in position 2, I should keep it there to confirm and test other positions.\n\nSo in guess 2, I should have R in the second position again to verify or get more feedback on other letters.\n\nThus, word like X R Y Z W, where X,Y,Z,W are new letters, excluding C,A,N,E.\n\nPossible words:\n- BROIL: B-R-O-I-L, letters B,O,I,L\n- GROWL: G-R-O-W-L, has W,L\n- PROWL: P-R-O-W-L\n- TRAIN: T-R-A-I-N, A and N out, invalid.\n- FROND: F-R-O-N-D, N out.\n- GRIND: G-R-I-N-D, N out.\n\nSo, B R something.\n\nBRISK: B-R-I-S-K, as I thought earlier.\n\nPRISM: P-R-I-S-M\n\nDRUID: D-R-U-I-D, U and D, but D repeated? It\'s okay, letters D,U,I.\n\nI and U vowels.\n\nTRIPE: T-R-I-P-E, E out.\n\nNot good.\n\nBRICK: B-R-I-C-K, C out.\n\nSo PRISM seems fine: P-R-I-S-M\n\nSimilarly, TRIMS: T-R-I-M-S, but S could be last.\n\nAnother one: HORDE, H-O-R-D-E, R is third position; not second.\n\nI need R to be second letter.\n\nPERSU? Not common.\n\nPerhaps URBEX? Not English.\n\nStick to common words.\n\nAnother common word: BRIDE, B-R-I-D-E, but E is out.\n\nB R I D E, E eliminated.\n\nSo, BROOD: B-R-O-O-D, O repeated.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nGROUT: G-R-O-U-T, letters G,O,U,T.\n\nU and O vowels to test.\n\nPRONG: P-R-O-N-G, N out.\n\nFORUM: F-O-R-U-M, R is third position.\n\nF O R U M, position: F(1), O(2), R(3) – not second.\n\nTo have R second, it should be _ R _ _ _\n\nSo many words: LIKE BRASH, but BRASH: B-R-A-S-H, A out.\n\nSHARD: S-H-A-R-D, A out and R third.\n\nCURED: C-U-R-E-D, C and E out.\n\nSo better: PRISM (P-R-I-S-M) or BRISK (B-R-I-S-K)\n\nBRISK seems common and good: B-R-I-S-K.\n\nLetters: B, I, S, K – all possible.\n\nSimilarly, PRISM: P, I, S, M.\n\nB, P, S are consonants; I is vowel.\n\nS is very common, so including S might be helpful.\n\nCRISP is out due to C.\n\nAnother word: TRUCK, T-R-U-C-K, C out.\n\nSo not.\n\nGLORY: G-L-O-R-Y, R fourth.\n\nI think BRISK or PRISM are fine.\n\nLet me choose BRISK: it\'s a common Wordle word.\n\nSo guess: BRISK\n\nBut let\'s confirm: B-R-I-S-K\n\nIn the feedback, I can see which of B, I, S, K are in the word and where.\n\nIf I get feedback, I might identify the word faster.\n\nPRISM might be equally good.\n\nI recall that in Wordle, words like STOMP or SLATE are common, but with R fixed.\n\nSince A and E are out, vowels are likely O, I, U or Y.\n\nBRISK has I.\n\nPRISM also has I.\n\nBut PRISM has M which is less common; BRISK has K which is common.\n\nK is common in endings.\n\nBRISK ends with K.\n\nBut let\'s pick one.\n\nI\'ll go with BRISK for the second guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n\n- R is confirmed to be in the secret word and in the correct position (second letter). So the secret word has the form _ R _ _ _.\n- C, A, N, and E are eliminated; they are not in the secret word.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must have R in the second position to leverage the known correct position.\n- It should avoid C, A, N, E entirely.\n- It should include new common letters to maximize information gain, such as testing other vowels (e.g., I, O, U) or frequent consonants (e.g., B, S, K, T).\n- Considering above, ""brisk"" is a good choice: B-R-I-S-K. This tests B, I, S, and K, all new letters not eliminated.\n\nGuess: brisk  \nExpected format:\n\n<guess>brisk</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: brisk -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n- R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd).\n- C, A, N, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: brisk -> B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)\n- R is again confirmed in the 2nd position (as expected).\n- S is in the word but not in the 4th position (since it\'s marked as present but not correct position? Wait, the feedback is S(✓) which means S is in the word and in the correct position? Let me check the feedback format.\n\nThe feedback format is:\n- ✓ : correct letter in correct position\n- - : letter in word but wrong position\n- x : letter not in word\n\nIn guess 2: B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)\n\nSo:\n- B is not in the word (x)\n- R is correct and in position 2 (✓)\n- I is not in the word (x)\n- S is correct and in position 4? Because S is the 4th letter in ""brisk"", and it has ✓, so S is in the word and in the correct position (4th).\n- K is not in the word (x)\n\nTherefore, from guess 2:\n- S is in the word and in the 4th position.\n- B, I, K are not in the word.\n\nAlso, from guess 1, we know C, A, N, E are not in the word.\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word has R in position 2 and S in position 4.\n- So the word is: _ R _ S _\n- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, B, I, K\n\nWe need to find a word that fits _ R _ S _\n\nAvailable letters: We must avoid C, A, N, E, B, I, K.\n\nCommon letters left: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but some are less common).\n\nWe need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5.\n\nPosition 1: can be a consonant or vowel? Since A, E, I are out, possible vowels are O, U, and sometimes Y.\n\nPosition 3: same, can be a consonant or vowel.\n\nPosition 5: typically a consonant, but can be a vowel or Y.\n\nWe should choose a word that tests common remaining letters to narrow down possibilities.\n\nPossible words: Let\'s think of 5-letter words with second letter R, fourth letter S.\n\nExamples:\n- TRUST: T R U S T -> but T is in position 1 and 5? We don\'t know if T is in the word.\n- GROWS: G R O W S -> but S is in position 5, not 4. We need S in position 4.\n- We need _ R _ S _, so third letter can be anything, and then S in fourth.\n\nMore examples:\n- PRESS: P R E S S -> but E is eliminated, so no.\n- CROSS: C is eliminated.\n- DRESS: D R E S S -> E eliminated.\n- GRASS: G R A S S -> A eliminated.\n- TRUSS: T R U S S -> this could be, letters T, R, U, S, S. S is repeated, but that\'s okay. Position: T(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), S(5). But we have S in position 4, and position 5 is also S? The word is T R U S S.\n\nBut we have S in position 4, which is correct, and position 5 is S, which might be okay if the word has two S\'s? But in feedback, for guess 2, S was in position 4 and marked correct, but we don\'t know if there is another S.\n\nIn ""brisk"", S was in position 4 and marked ✓, meaning it is correct and in position. But the secret word has S in position 4, and it might have another S elsewhere? We don\'t know.\n\nBut in TRUSS, it has S in position 4 and 5, so if we guess it, we might get information.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words without eliminated letters.\n\nEliminated: A, B, C, E, I, K, N\n\nSo available: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nNow, words of form _ R _ S _\n\nPossible:\n- DRUMS: D R U M S -> S is in position 5, not 4. We need S in position 4, so the word must have the fourth letter S.\n- So the pattern is: position 1: ?, position 2: R, position 3: ?, position 4: S, position 5: ?\n\nSo for example:\n- TRUMP: T R U M P -> but no S? Position 4 is M, not S. Not matching.\n- We need position 4 to be S.\n\nSo:\n- Words like: PRISM, but we used that? No, we didn\'t use PRISM, but in guess 2 we used BRISK, which has S in position 4? BRISK is B-R-I-S-K, so position 4 is S, and it was correct.\n\nBut PRISM is P-R-I-S-M, which has I, and I is eliminated now, so we can\'t use PRISM because I is not in the word.\n\nSimilarly, other words.\n\nList of possible words with _ R _ S _ and no A,B,C,E,I,K,N.\n\nFor position 1: possible letters: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nPosition 3: same set.\n\nPosition 5: same set.\n\nCommon words:\n- FROST: F R O S T -> position 4 is S? F-R-O-S-T, so position 1:F, 2:R, 3:O, 4:S, 5:T. And O and T are not eliminated. So FROST is a candidate.\n- PROST: not a word, usually.\n- GROSS: G R O S S -> position 4 is S, position 5 is S. G and O available.\n- TROSS: not common.\n- CROSS: C eliminated.\n- DROSS: D R O S S -> D and O available.\n- PROSE: P R O S E -> but E is eliminated.\n- VERSE: V E R S E, E eliminated and R position wrong.\n- WORSE: W O R S E, E eliminated.\n- PURSE: P U R S E, E eliminated.\n- HORSE: H O R S E, E eliminated.\n- TRUSS: T R U S S -> T and U available.\n- GRUMP: no S.\n- DRUMS: position 5 S, not 4.\n- TRUMP: no S.\n- FRUMP: not common, and no S in 4th.\n- PRESS: E eliminated.\n\nSo possible candidates: FROST, GROSS, DROSS, TRUSS.\n\nAlso, others:\n- WREST: W R E S T, E eliminated.\n- CRUST: C eliminated.\n- TRUST: T R U S T -> position 4 is S? T-R-U-S-T, so position 1:T, 2:R, 3:U, 4:S, 5:T. T is repeated. And U available. So TRUST is a candidate.\n- GRASP: A eliminated.\n- CLASP: C and A eliminated.\n\nAnother one: PROWS? P R O W S, S in position 5, not 4.\n\nSo main candidates: FROST, GROSS, DROSS, TRUST, TRUSS.\n\nDROSS: D-R-O-S-S, so positions: D(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), S(5)\n\nGROSS: G(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), S(5)\n\nFROST: F(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), T(5)\n\nTRUST: T(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), T(5)\n\nTRUSS: T(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), S(5)\n\nWe need to choose one that tests new letters.\n\nWe have not tested: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut O and T are in multiple candidates.\n\nTo maximize information, we should choose a word that has letters not in the candidates, but we need to solve.\n\nSince we have only three positions to guess, and we know two letters, we can try to cover more possibilities.\n\nBut we have 6 guesses, so we can be efficient.\n\nAnother candidate: PROSY? Not common.\n\nOr TORSO: T O R S O, but R is third position? T-O-R-S-O, position 2 is O, not R. We need R in position 2.\n\nSo not.\n\nFOCUS: F O C U S, C eliminated and position wrong.\n\nSo back to the list.\n\nWe can choose FROST: it has F, O, T which are new.\n\nSimilarly, TRUST has T and U.\n\nBut in TRUST, T is in position 1 and 5, so if T is not in the word, we eliminate T, but if it is, we might get feedback.\n\nBut we don\'t know if T is in the word.\n\nSimilarly for FROST, we test F, O, T.\n\nO is a vowel that hasn\'t been tested, so it might be good to test O.\n\nIn FROST, position 3 is O, which is a vowel position.\n\nSimilarly, in TRUST, position 3 is U, another vowel.\n\nSince we have no vowels except possibly O or U, testing a word with O or U is good.\n\nWe also have S in position 4, which is fixed.\n\nNow, for the third guess, I think FROST is a good choice because it tests F, O, T.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose TRUST, it tests T and U.\n\nBut FROST has three new letters: F, O, T.\n\nGROSS has G and O, but S is repeated, so less information.\n\nDROSS has D and O.\n\nTRUSS has T and U, but S repeated.\n\nSo FROST seems best: new letters F, O, T.\n\nGuess: FROST\n\nBut let\'s see the pattern: _ R _ S _\n\nIf we guess FROST, it is F R O S T.\n\nIf it\'s correct, great. If not, we get feedback on F, O, T.\n\nFor example, if O is in the word but wrong position, or not, etc.\n\nSimilarly for T.\n\nSo I think FROST is a solid choice.\n\nWe could choose a word with more unique letters, but FROST has all unique.\n\nAnother word: PROUD, but no S in fourth.\n\nNot.\n\nSo I\'ll go with FROST.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)  \n  - R is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 2.  \n  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: brisk** → B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)  \n  - R is confirmed in position 2 (as expected).  \n  - S is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 4.  \n  - B, I, K are not in the word.  \n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- The secret word has the form: ** _ R _ S _** (position 2 is R, position 4 is S).  \n- Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, E, B, I, K** (not in the word).  \n- Available letters for positions 1, 3, and 5: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n- Key strategy for the next guess:  \n  - Must have R in position 2 and S in position 4 to maintain known positions.  \n  - Avoid eliminated letters.  \n  - Test new common letters to gather more information, especially focusing on untested vowels (O, U) and frequent consonants (T, F, G, etc.).  \n  - Prioritize words with unique letters to maximize information gain.  \n\n### Why ""frost"" is a good guess:\n- Fits the pattern: **F R O S T** (position 1: F, position 2: R, position 3: O, position 4: S, position 5: T).  \n- Tests three new common letters:  \n  - **F**: A frequent consonant not yet tested.  \n  - **O**: An untested vowel (since A, E, I are eliminated, O is a likely candidate).  \n  - **T**: A very common consonant, often in word endings.  \n- Avoids eliminated letters and repeats.  \n- If incorrect, the feedback will provide information on F, O, and T (e.g., if O is in the word but in the wrong position, or if F/T are present or absent), which will significantly narrow down possibilities for the next guess.\n\n<guess>frost</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: brisk -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)\nGuess 3: frost -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) T(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n- R is in the correct position (2).\n- C, A, N, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: brisk -> B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)\n- R is correct in position 2.\n- S is correct in position 4.\n- B, I, K are not in the word.\n\nGuess 3: frost -> F(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) T(✓)\n- R is still correct in position 2.\n- S is still correct in position 4.\n- T is now marked as ✓ in position 5?

But O(x) means O is not in the word at all? The symbol is ""x"", meaning the letter is not in the word.\n  Position 4: S (✓) correct.\n  Position 5: T (✓) means T is in the word and in the correct position (5th).\n\nSo, from feedback:\n- O is not in the word (x) because it\'s marked with x.\n- F is not in the word (x).\n- T is in the correct position (5th).\n\nTherefore, new information:\n- T is in the word and correctly placed in position 5.\n- F and O are not in the word.\n- O is eliminated: since it was in position 3 and marked x, meaning it\'s not in the word at all.\n\nSo now, the secret word pattern is: _ R _ S T\n\nBecause:\n- Position 2: R (known)\n- Position 4: S (known)\n- Position 5: T (now known)\n\nAnd we have positions 1 and 3 unknown.\n\nEliminated letters: From guess 1: C, A, N, E; guess 2: B, I, K; guess 3: F, O.\n\nSo eliminated: A, B, C, E, F, I, K, N, O.\n\nWe must avoid these letters.\n\nAvailable letters: D, G, H, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but no vowels left except U and Y? O is out, so vowels are U, and sometimes Y).\n\nThe word must end with ""S T"", and have R in second position.\n\nSo positions: 1: ?, 2: R, 3: ?, 4: S, 5: T.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word: X R Y S T, where Y is position 3.\n\nAvailable letters for position 1 and 3: D, G, H, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nSince position 3 can be a vowel, possible vowels left: U, Y.\n\nPosition 1 is typically a consonant.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- TRUST? But T is in position 5, and in TRUST it would be position 1 T and position 5 T. But T is only one T? We have T in position 5, so position 1 cannot be T? Not necessarily; there could be two Ts.\n\nIn feedback for frost: T in position 5 is marked ✓, but that doesn\'t say anything about another T.\n\nSimilarly, in guess 3, F and O are eliminated.\n\nBut TRUST has T in position 1: T-R-U-S-T.\n\nBut we have eliminated letters? U is not eliminated, and S,T,R are already present.\n\nBut is U available? Yes.\n\nSo TRUST: positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:U, 4:S, 5:T.\n\nBut we know position 5 is T, so it fits.\n\nHowever, position 1 is T: is T allowed? T is not eliminated; we know T is in the word, but it\'s in position 5. It could be that the word has another T.\n\nSimilarly, other words.\n\nBut we need to see possible words fitting the pattern.\n\nAnother word: WORST? W-O-R-S-T, but O is eliminated, so no.\n\nWORST has O in position 2? W-O-R-ST, position 2 is O? But our pattern is _ R _ S T, so position 2 must be R. WORST has O R? No: W-O-R-S-T, so positions: 1:W, 2:O, 3:R, 4:S, 5:T – not matching, since position 2 is O, not R.\n\nOur word has position 2 fixed as R.\n\nSo better: TRUST: T-R-U-S-T – fits the pattern: position 1:T, 2:R, 3:U, 4:S, 5:T.\n\nAnother one: GRUST? Not a word.\n\nBRUST? Not a word.\n\nCRUST: But C eliminated.\n\nPRUST? Not word.\n\nDRUST? Not word.\n\nRUST? Not 5 letters.\n\nMust be 5 letters.\n\nAnother common word: TRUST is one.\n\nWREST? W-R-E-S-T, E is eliminated.\n\nNot.\n\nPREST? P-R-E-S-T, E eliminated.\n\nNot.\n\nMaybe: MOIST? But M-O-I-S-T, I eliminated and position 2 is O, not R.\n\nNot pattern.\n\nFocus on words: X R Y S T.\n\nWith Y in position 3.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- TRUST: T R U S T\n- GRUMP? But ends with P, not S T.\n- DRUMS? But ends with S, not S T.\n\nOur word ends with ST.\n\nList of 5-letter words ending with ""ST"" and second letter R.\n\nBut we have position 4 S and 5 T, so it ends with ""ST"".\n\nBut position 4 S and 5 T, so the word ends with S T, like frost, trust, etc.\n\nWords: FROST we tried, O and F eliminated.\n\nOther common words: CRUST eliminated C.\n\nRUST? Not 5 letters.\n\nMaybe: HORST? H-O-R-S-T, but position 2 is O? H O R S T, position 2 O, not R.\n\nNot.\n\nVIRST? Not word.\n\nSo trust is the most common.\n\nAnother: WREST? No, position.\n\nPerhaps WORST, but position 2 O.\n\nNo.\n\nWords like ""urst"" but not.\n\nPerhaps ""THRST""? Not word, missing vowel.\n\nPosition 3 needs a vowel.\n\nPossible vowels: U or Y.\n\nSo words:\n- TRUST: T R U S T\n- TRYST: T R Y S T? T-R-Y-S-T, that could be: letters T,R,Y,S,T – S and T correct positions, R position 2, position 3 Y.\n\nY is a vowel sometimes.\n\nTRYST is a word.\n\nAnd Y not tested.\n\nURGH? Not.\n\nAnother: PRYST? Not word.\n\nSo possible candidates: TRUST or TRYST.\n\nFirst, TRUST: T-R-U-S-T\n\nWe know position 5 is T, so T is present. Position 1 could be another T.\n\nBut we need to see if U is possible.\n\nSimilarly, TRYST: T-R-Y-S-T\n\nY could be the vowel.\n\nBut we have eliminated letters? U and Y are not eliminated.\n\nIn TRUST, position 3 U.\n\nIn TRYST, position 3 Y.\n\nWhich to choose? We should test U or Y.\n\nBut with one guess, we might solve.\n\nWe have only one unknown position? Positions: we have 1 and 3 unknown.\n\nFor TRUST: position 1 and 3 to be filled.\n\nBut we know position 1 could be T? In TRUST, position 1 is T, position 3 is U.\n\nSimilarly, for TRYST, position 1 T, position 3 Y.\n\nBut is there a word with different position 1?\n\nFor example, could position 1 be G? GRUST not word.\n\nH? HRUST not word.\n\nD? DRUST not word.\n\nP? PRUST not word.\n\nW? WRUST not word.\n\nPerhaps ONLY trust and tryst are common words.\n\nAlso, GROST? Not word.\n\nFROST was tried.\n\nAnother possibility: first position might not be T.\n\nFor example, can position 1 be D? DREST? But E eliminated.\n\nDRAFT? No S T ending.\n\nWe must have position 4 S and 5 T.\n\nSo the only common words ending with * R * S T are TRUST and TRYST.\n\nAlso, perhaps WREST, but W-R-E-S-T, E eliminated.\n\nNo.\n\nURST isn\'t a thing.\n\nSo very few possibilities: TRUST and TRYST.\n\nBut TRYST is less common.\n\nWe can try TRUST.\n\nIn feedback from guess 3, T is in position 5 and marked correct, but if TRUST has T in position 1, it might be correct or not.\n\nIf we guess TRUST, if it\'s correct, done; if not, feedback will show.\n\nBut perhaps save a guess by testing letters.\n\nBut we have only two positions, position 1 and position 3.\n\nPosition 3 must be a vowel-like letter, likely U or Y.\n\nSince O and I are out, U and Y are possible.\n\nWord: TRUST or TRYST.\n\nTo decide, note that in guess 3, frost: we had O tested and invalid, but U hasn\'t been tested.\n\nSimilarly, Y hasn\'t been tested.\n\nWe can make a guess that tests U specifically.\n\nBut since TRUST is a valid word, we can guess it directly.\n\nPerhaps there is another word: BRUST? Not common.\n\nCRUFT? Not S T.\n\nSo I think TRUST is the best guess.\n\nIf we guess TRUST, it might be the word.\n\nOr not.\n\nBut let\'s see: if TRUST is not the word, then we get feedback.\n\nFor example, if position 1 T is wrong or something.\n\nBut in TRUST: positions 1,2,3,4,5: T R U S T\n\nWe know:\n- Position 2 R ✓\n- Position 4 S ✓\n- Position 5 T ✓\n\nSo for position 1 T and position 3 U.\n\nIf we guess TRUST, and if the word is TRUST, then all correct.\n\nIf not, suppose position 1 is not T, then T might be wrong.\n\nBut we know T is in position 5, so if position 1 is T, it might be another T.\n\nIn feedback from frost: T was only in position 5, but that doesn\'t mean there cannot be another T.\n\nSimilarly, in secret word, there could be multiple Ts.\n\nFor example, TRUST has two Ts.\n\nSimilarly, TRYST has two Ts.\n\nSo possible.\n\nTo confirm, we can look for other words ending with ST, second letter R, and position 3 a valid letter.\n\nAnother word: GROUTS? But ending S, not ST? G-R-O-U-T-S? No, 6 letters.\n\nShort list: trust or tryst.\n\nPerhaps ""PREST"" but E out.\n\nSo TRUST is a word.\n\nGuess TRUST.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested U, so if we guess TRUST, and U is wrong, we get U(x), then we know to try Y.\n\nBut since we have guesses left, it\'s fine.\n\nWe could guess a word that uses U without T in position 1, to test U independently? But that might be hard.\n\nFor example, guess: CRUMP? Not ending ST.\n\nMust fit the known letters.\n\nThe only practical choices are TRUST or TRYST.\n\nTRYST: T R Y S T\n\nY might be possible.\n\nBut TRUST is more common.\n\nIn Wordle, TRUST is a possible word.\n\nSo I think we should guess TRUST.\n\nBased on the pattern and eliminated letters.\n\nFrom feedback: we know T is in position 5, S in 4, R in 2.\n\nSo word is _ R _ S T\n\nPosition 1 and 3 unknown.\n\nSince we have no U tested, and U is a common vowel.\n\nLet\'s guess TRUST.\n\nIn the response, if we get U correct or not.\n\nIf not, next guess TRYST.\n\nBut we can do it in this guess.\n\nSince position 5 is T, and we are guessing position 1 T, if wrong, we know position 1 is different.\n\nBut let\'s proceed.\n\nSo guess: TRUST\n\nRemember the format.\n\nThink step by step.### Step-by-Step Thought Process\n\nWith the feedback from all three guesses, here\'s what we know:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)**:\n  - R is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 2.\n  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.\n  \n- **Guess 2: brisk → B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)**:\n  - R is confirmed in position 2 (as before).\n  - S is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 4.\n  - B, I, K are not in the word.\n  \n- **Guess 3: frost → F(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) T(✓)**:\n  - R is still correct in position 2.\n  - S is still correct in position 4.\n  - T is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 5.\n  - F and O are not in the word.\n\n### Summary of Known Information:\n- **Secret word pattern**: Position 2 is R, position 4 is S, position 5 is T. So the word must be: _ R _ S T (unknown positions: 1 and 3).\n- **Eliminated letters**: A, B, C, E, F, I, K, N, O (these cannot appear in the word).\n- **Available letters for positions 1 and 3**: D, G, H, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since common vowels A, E, I, O are out, position 3 must likely be U or Y, or a consonant).\n- **Possible words**: Given the pattern _ S T with R fixed, common English words include:\n  - TRUST (T R U S T)\n  - TRYST (T R Y S T)\n  - Less common/niche words may exist, but TRUST and TRYST are the most likely candidates.\n- **Strategy for this guess**:\n  - Since only positions 1 and 3 are unknown, and we have limited guesses left (3 tries remaining), it\'s efficient to test one of the plausible words directly.\n  - TRUST is a common word that uses U (an untested vowel) and includes T in position 1 (which is possible since T is already confirmed at position 5—there could be another T).\n  - Guessing TRUST tests U specifically. If correct, we solve it; if incorrect, feedback will indicate if U is present and help refine the next guess (e.g., try TRYST or consider other words like DRUSY, though none are common).\n  - TRYST could be an alternative, but TRUST is prioritized as it\'s more frequently used, and U is a more common vowel than Y in this position.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is **TRUST**.\n\n<guess>trust</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: brisk -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)\nGuess 3: frost -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) T(✓)\nGuess 4: trust -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(✓) U(x) S(✓) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd).

Guess 2: brisk -> B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)
- S is in the word and in the correct position (4th).

Guess 3: frost -> F(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) T(✓)
- T is in the word and in the correct position (5th).

Guess 4: trust -> T(✓) R(✓) U(x) S(✓) T(✓)
- T is also in position 1 and correct? Let's parse: T(✓) for position 1, R(✓) position 2, U(x) position 3, S(✓) position 4, T(✓) position 5.

So from guess 4:
- Position 1: T is correct and in place.
- Position 2: R correct and in place.
- Position 3: U is not in the word at all (x).
- Position 4: S correct and in place.
- Position 5: T correct and in place.

Therefore, the secret word is T R _ S T, with the third letter missing, and U is eliminated.

Also, from previous guesses, we have eliminated: C, A, N, E, B, I, K, F, O, and now U.

So eliminated letters: A, B, C, E, F, I, K, N, O, U.

Available letters: D, G, H, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The word is T R ? S T, so we need to find a letter for position 3 from the available set.

Position 3 must be a letter that can form a word with T R _ S T.

Common English words: 
- TRUST: but we just guessed it, and U is out, so not.
- TRYST: T R Y S T, which uses Y.

Y is available and not eliminated.

Other possibilities? 
- TREST: but E is eliminated.
- TRIST: T R I S T, but I is eliminated.
- WREST: W R E S T, E eliminated and position 2 not R? WREST has W(1), R(2), E(3), S(4), T(5) — but E is eliminated, so no.
- Other words: GROST? Not a word.
- PREST: P R E S T, E eliminated.
- DREST: D R E S T, E eliminated.

So the only common word that fits is TRYST: T R Y S T.

Y is available, and it's a valid word.

Is there any other? For example, TRPST? No, not a word.

Or with other letters: T R H S T? Not a word.

T R M S T? Not a word.

T R L S T? Not a word.

T R D S T? Not a word.

T R G S T? Not a word.

T R Y S T is the only common word.

Therefore, the secret word must be TRYST.

So we should guess TRYST.

In the feedback, if it's correct, we win.

If not, but it should be.

So guess: TRYST

But let's confirm the format.

### Step-by-Step Thought Process

With the feedback from all four guesses, here's the current knowledge:

- **Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
  - R is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 2.  
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: brisk → B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)**  
  - R is confirmed in position 2.  
  - S is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 4.  
  - B, I, K are not in the word.  

- **Guess 3: frost → F(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) T(✓)**  
  - R is still correct in position 2.  
  - S is still correct in position 4.  
  - T is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 5.  
  - F and O are not in the word.  

- **Guess 4: trust → T(✓) R(✓) U(x) S(✓) T(✓)**  
  - T is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 1.  
  - R is still correct in position 2.  
  - U is not in the word.  
  - S is still correct in position 4.  
  - T is still correct in position 5 (confirming a second T).  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: From the feedback, the word must be **T R _ S T** (positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are confirmed as T, R, S, T respectively). Only position 3 is unknown.  
- **Eliminated letters**: A, B, C, E, F, I, K, N, O, U (these cannot appear in the word).  
- **Available letters for position 3**: D, G, H, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
- **Analysis of position 3**:  
  - The only common English word that fits the pattern **T R _ S T** is **TRYST** (with Y in position 3).  
  - Other combinations (e.g., T R D S T, T R G S T) do not form valid English words.  
  - Y is an available letter and is commonly used as a vowel in this context.  
- **Strategy**:  
  - With only one position unknown and limited possibilities, **TRYST** is the most logical and only common word that fits all constraints.  
  - Guessing **TRYST** directly can solve the puzzle if correct. If incorrect (though unlikely), it would provide feedback to refine further, but no other valid words exist.  

Therefore, the next guess is **TRYST**.

<guess>tryst</guess>",tryst,"We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd).

Guess 2: brisk -> B(x) R(✓) I(x) S(✓) K(x)
- S is in the word and in the correct position (4th).

Guess 3: frost -> F(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) T(✓)
- T is in the word and in the correct position (5th).

Guess 4: trust -> T(✓) R(✓) U(x) S(✓) T(✓)
- T is also in position 1 and correct? Let's parse: T(✓) for position 1, R(✓) position 2, U(x) position 3, S(✓) position 4, T(✓) position 5.

So from guess 4:
- Position 1: T is correct and in place.
- Position 2: R correct and in place.
- Position 3: U is not in the word at all (x).
- Position 4: S correct and in place.
- Position 5: T correct and in place.

Therefore, the secret word is T R _ S T, with the third letter missing, and U is eliminated.

Also, from previous guesses, we have eliminated: C, A, N, E, B, I, K, F, O, and now U.

So eliminated letters: A, B, C, E, F, I, K, N, O, U.

Available letters: D, G, H, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The word is T R ? S T, so we need to find a letter for position 3 from the available set.

Position 3 must be a letter that can form a word with T R _ S T.

Common English words: 
- TRUST: but we just guessed it, and U is out, so not.
- TRYST: T R Y S T, which uses Y.

Y is available and not eliminated.

Other possibilities? 
- TREST: but E is eliminated.
- TRIST: T R I S T, but I is eliminated.
- WREST: W R E S T, E eliminated and position 2 not R? WREST has W(1), R(2), E(3), S(4), T(5) — but E is eliminated, so no.
- Other words: GROST? Not a word.
- PREST: P R E S T, E eliminated.
- DREST: D R E S T, E eliminated.

So the only common word that fits is TRYST: T R Y S T.

Y is available, and it's a valid word.

Is there any other? For example, TRPST? No, not a word.

Or with other letters: T R H S T? Not a word.

T R M S T? Not a word.

T R L S T? Not a word.

T R D S T? Not a word.

T R G S T? Not a word.

T R Y S T is the only common word.

Therefore, the secret word must be TRYST.

So we should guess TRYST.

In the feedback, if it's correct, we win.

If not, but it should be.

So guess: TRYST

But let's confirm the format.### Step-by-Step Thought Process

  - S is still correct in position 4.  
  - T is still correct in position 5 (confirming a second T).
