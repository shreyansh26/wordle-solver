Alright, the user is asking me to make my first guess in what seems like a word-guessing game similar to Wordle. Since it's the first turn and I have zero information, I need a strategic starting word. 

Hmm... optimal first guesses usually prioritize common letters and vowel-consonant balance to maximize information gain. Words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" come to mind—they're popular among enthusiasts because they cover frequent letters and include vowels. 

But wait, should I pick something that includes ""S""? Many plurals end with S, but since the word is exactly 5 letters, ending with S might be less likely. Alternatively, ""ADIEU"" focuses on vowels but leaves out common consonants. 

After some thought, ""CRATE"" feels balanced: it has two vowels (A,E) and three consonants (C,R,T) which all appear frequently in English. The letters C, R, A, T, and E give good coverage across different positions. Plus, none are overly rare—like Q or Z. 

This choice should likely reveal several hits or misses, especially since E and T are among the most common letters. If I get feedback showing correct positions or existing letters elsewhere, future guesses will narrow down faster. 

I'll commit to ""CRATE"" for now—it's methodical enough to set up the next move efficiently.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crate"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C, A, T are not in the secret word at all.
- The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position.
- The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

Therefore, the secret word must contain R and E, and does not contain C, A, or T.

We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, A, T (since they are absent)
- Must include R and E (since they are present, but in different positions)
- We also know that R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5.

We can use this information to form our next guess.

Let's think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, T.

Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

Possible letters to consider: We have 26 letters, minus C, A, T, so 23 left. But we also know the word has R and E.

We should try to cover more common letters to get more information.

Common consonants besides R: S, L, N, etc. Common vowels: E (we already have), and then O, I, U.

We also know that R is in the word but not in position 2. So R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: the word is 5 letters.

Similarly, E is in the word but not in position 5, so E could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We should avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5 in our next guess.

Let's try to think of words that have R and E, and also include other common letters we haven't tried yet, such as S, L, N, O, I, etc.

Some candidate words:

- ""robes"": but has S? Let's check: R in position 1 (which is allowed, since we don't know if R is in 1 or not), O, B, E, S. But we don't know about B and S. Also, E is in position 4 (not 5, so that's allowed). However, we don't know if O, B, S are in the word.

But note: we have to avoid A, C, T. ""robes"" doesn't have A, C, T. So it's a candidate.

But we might want to use a word that has more common letters to maximize information.

Another candidate: ""risen"" - R in position 1, I, S, E, N. E is in position 4. This avoids A, C, T.

But we know that in the first guess, R was in position 2 and was marked as wrong position. Now we are putting R in position 1. It might be that R is actually in position 1? Or it might be in 3,4,5. We don't know.

Alternatively, we could try to put R in a different position to test.

But note: we have two letters we know: R and E. We should try to place them in positions we haven't ruled out.

We also have three other positions to guess. We should try to use new common letters.

Another idea: ""reign"" - R in 1, E in 2, I, G, N. But E is in position 2? We don't know if E can be in position 2. The feedback only said E is not in position 5, so position 2 is allowed. Similarly, R in position 1 is allowed.

But we have to remember that R was originally in position 2 and was wrong. Now we are moving R to position 1. If the secret word has R in position 1, then we would get a check. If not, then we know R is in 3,4, or 5.

Similarly, E was in position 5 and was wrong, now we put it in position 2. If it's correct, we get a check; if not, then we know it's in 3 or 4.

But we also want to test other letters.

Another candidate: ""liner"" - L, I, N, E, R. But note: E is in position 4 and R in position 5. This avoids A, C, T. Also, we haven't tried L, I, N.

But we have to be cautious: if we put R in position 5, that might be a new position. Similarly, E in position 4.

However, we know that E cannot be in position 5, but position 4 is allowed. And R cannot be in position 2, but position 5 is allowed.

But note: the word ""liner"" has R at the end. That might be a good test.

But let me think of more words.

Another common word: ""rouse"" - R in 1, O, U, S, E. E in position 5? Wait, we cannot put E in position 5 because we know E is not in position 5. So ""rouse"" has E in position 5 -> invalid because we know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5, so we can have E in other positions. But if we put E in position 5, we know it will be marked as wrong position (if the word has E) or absent? But we know E is present, so if we put it in position 5, it will be marked as '-' (wrong position) because we know it's not in position 5. But that doesn't give new information. So it's better to put E in a position that we haven't tried and that is allowed (1,2,3,4).

Similarly for R: avoid position 2.

So ""rouse"" is not ideal because E is in position 5.

We can try ""rodes"" or ""rides"", but we don't know about D or S.

Another idea: ""resin"" - R in 1, E in 2, S, I, N. This has E in position 2 and R in position 1. It avoids A, C, T.

But we might also consider ""rinse"" - R in 1, I, N, S, E. E in position 5? Again, we know E is not in position 5, so we avoid that.

So ""rinse"" is not good because of E at the end.

Similarly, ""risen"" has E in position 4: R(1), I(2), S(3), E(4), N(5). That seems okay.

But in ""risen"", R is in position 1 and E in position 4.

We also have the letter I, S, N to test.

Alternatively, we can try a word that puts R in a different position, say position 3 or 4.

For example, ""beryl"" - B, E, R, Y, L. But we don't know about B, Y, L. And E is in position 2, R in position 3.

This avoids A, C, T.

But ""beryl"" is a less common word? We should stick to common words.

Another common word: ""peril"" - P, E, R, I, L. E in position 2, R in position 3. Avoids A, C, T.

But we haven't tested P, I, L.

We could also try ""urged"" - U, R, G, E, D. But U and G and D are less common? And E is in position 4, R in position 2? Wait, we cannot put R in position 2 because we know R is not in position 2. So ""urged"" has R in position 2 -> that would be invalid because we know R is not in position 2. So we must avoid putting R in position 2.

Similarly, we must avoid E in position 5.

So in our next guess, R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.

Let me list some words that have R and E, and avoid A, C, T, and with R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.

Possible words:

- ""robed"": R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), D(5) -> but E is in position 4? Wait, position 4 is allowed. But we have D at the end? And we don't know about O, B, D.

- ""robes"": as I thought earlier: R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), S(5). E is in position 4, which is allowed. R in position 1, which is allowed. We test O, B, S.

- ""ropes"": R(1), O(2), P(3), E(4), S(5). Similar.

- ""rides"": R(1), I(2), D(3), E(4), S(5). But R is in position 1, E in position 4. We test I, D, S.

- ""riles"": R(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). Same.

But note: in all these, we are putting R in position 1. What if R is not in position 1? Then we will get a '-' for R, and we know it must be in 3,4, or 5.

Alternatively, we can put R in position 3 or 4 to test other possibilities.

For example, ""wired"": W(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). But E is in position 4, which is allowed. R is in position 3, which is allowed. We test W, I, D.

But W is not very common.

""fired"": F(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). Same.

""hired"": H(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), D(5).

But we might get more information if we use more common letters.

Another idea: since we have two letters to place (R and E) and three new letters, we should choose common letters for the other positions.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, L, N, O, I, D, etc.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and must be valid.

I think ""risen"" is a good candidate: R in 1, I in 2, S in 3, E in 4, N in 5. This tests R in position 1, E in position 4, and also tests I, S, N.

But note: we know that E is not in position 5, but in ""risen"", E is in position 4, which is fine. And R is in position 1, which is not the second position (which we know is wrong for R).

Alternatively, ""robin"" but ""robin"" doesn't have E? We know the word must have E, so we must include E.

So we must have both R and E.

Another word: ""reign"" - R(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5). This has E in position 2, which is allowed. And R in position 1. We test I, G, N.

But we don't know if E can be in position 2. It might be, or it might not.

Similarly, we can try ""reins"" - R(1), E(2), I(3), N(4), S(5). But E is in position 2 and we have S at the end. But note: we know E is not in position 5, but in this word, E is in position 2, so that's allowed.

But in ""reins"", we have E in position 2. If the secret word has E in position 2, we get a check. If not, we get a '-'.

But we also have R in position 1.

I think either ""risen"" or ""reign"" or ""ropes"" are fine.

But let me consider the feedback we got: in the first guess, R was in position 2 and was marked as wrong position. That means R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 1, and if it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R must be in position 3,4, or 5.

Similarly for E: it was in position 5 and was wrong, so if we put E in position 4 (like in ""risen"") and it is correct, we get a check; if not, we get a '-' and then we know E must be in position 1,2, or 3.

So to maximize information, we might want to test R in a new position and E in a new position.

But we have limited tries.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has R and E and also includes other common letters that we haven't eliminated.

I think ""ropes"" is a good choice: R in 1, O in 2, P in 3, E in 4, S in 5. We test O, P, S, and also the positions for R and E.

But note: we know that the secret word does not have A, C, T, so we are safe.

Another common word: ""lives"" but that has V and S, and no R? We must include R and E.

""liver"" - L, I, V, E, R. This has E in position 4 and R in position 5. So E is in position 4 (allowed) and R in position 5 (allowed, since we only know it's not in position 2). We test L, I, V.

But V is less common.

I think ""ropes"" is better.

But let me check if ""ropes"" is valid: yes.

We could also use ""roses"", but that has S twice? And we don't know about S. But ""roses"" has R in 1, O in 2, S in 3, E in 4, S in 5. But we have two S's. It might be okay, but we don't know if the word has S.

But we are trying to test multiple letters.

To avoid duplication, ""ropes"" has unique letters: R, O, P, E, S. That's good.

Similarly, ""risen"" has R, I, S, E, N.

I think I'll go with ""risen"" because it includes I, S, N which are common.

But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was absent, so we avoid A. But we haven't tested I, S, N.

So ""risen"" seems good.

But let me see: we have R in position 1 (which might be correct or not), and E in position 4.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Another word: ""renew"" but that has W and two E's? Not ideal.

I think ""risen"" is a solid choice.

But wait, we know that the secret word has R and E, and we are putting R in 1 and E in 4. If the secret word has R in 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus. Similarly for E.

Also, we test I in position 2, S in position 3, N in position 5.

We know that position 2 was R in the first guess and was wrong, but now we are putting I there. It might be correct or not.

So I'll go with ""risen"".

But let me confirm: the word ""risen"" is valid.

So my next guess is ""risen"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":
- C, A, T are **absent** from the secret word.
- R is **present** but not in position 2.
- E is **present** but not in position 5.

For the second guess:
- The word must include **R** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).
- It must **exclude** C, A, T (since they are absent).
- R cannot be placed in position 2 (as per feedback).
- E cannot be placed in position 5 (as per feedback).
- To maximize information, the guess should test new common letters (e.g., S, I, N) and place R and E in positions not yet ruled out (e.g., R in position 1 or 3–5; E in positions 1–4).

The word **""risen""** is chosen because:
- It includes R (position 1) and E (position 4), both in allowed positions.
- It tests new common letters: I (position 2), S (position 3), and N (position 5).
- It avoids C, A, T.
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R and E while providing information on I, S, and N.

- R: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C, A, T are not in the secret word at all.

Similarly, E was in position 5 and was wrong, now we put it in position 2. If it's correct, we get a check; if not, then we know it's in 3 or 4.

But we also want to test other letters.

Another candidate: ""liner"" - L, I, N, E, R. But note: E is in position 4 and R in position 5. This avoids A, C, T. Also, we haven't tried L, I, N.

But we have to be cautious: if we put R in position 5, that might be a new position. Similarly, E in position 4.

However, we know that E cannot be in position 5, but position 4 is allowed. And R cannot be in position 2, but position 5 is allowed.

But note: the word ""liner"" has R at the end. That might be a good test.

But let me think of more words.

Another common word: ""rouse"" - R in 1, O, U, S, E. E in position 5? Wait, we cannot put E in position 5 because we know E is not in position 5. So ""rouse"" has E in position 5 -> invalid because we know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5, so we can have E in other positions. But if we put E in position 5, we know it will be marked as wrong position (if the word has E) or absent? But we know E is present, so if we put it in position 5, it will be marked as '-' (wrong position) because we know it's not in position 5. But that doesn't give new information. So it's better to put E in a position that we haven't tried and that is allowed (1,2,3,4).

Similarly for R: avoid position 2.

So ""rouse"" is not ideal because E is in position 5.

We can try ""rodes"" or ""rides"", but we don't know about D or S.

Another idea: ""resin"" - R in 1, E in 2, S, I, N. This has E in position 2 and R in position 1. It avoids A, C, T.

But we might also consider ""rinse"" - R in 1, I, N, S, E. E in position 5? Again, we know E is not in position 5, so we avoid that.

So ""rinse"" is not good because of E at the end.

Similarly, ""risen"" has E in position 4: R(1), I(2), S(3), E(4), N(5). That seems okay.

But in ""risen"", R is in position 1 and E in position 4.

We also have the letter I, S, N to test.

Alternatively, we can try a word that puts R in a different position, say position 3 or 4.

For example, ""beryl"" - B, E, R, Y, L. But we don't know about B, Y, L. And E is in position 2, R in position 3.

This avoids A, C, T.

But ""beryl"" is a less common word? We should stick to common words.

Another common word: ""peril"" - P, E, R, I, L. E in position 2, R in position 3. Avoids A, C, T.

But we haven't tested P, I, L.

We could also try ""urged"" - U, R, G, E, D. But U and G and D are less common? And E is in position 4, R in position 2? Wait, we cannot put R in position 2 because we know R is not in position 2. So ""urged"" has R in position 2 -> that would be invalid because we know R is not in position 2. So we must avoid putting R in position 2.

Similarly, we must avoid E in position 5.

So in our next guess, R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.

Let me list some words that have R and E, and avoid A, C, T, and with R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.

Possible words:

- ""robed"": R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), D(5) -> but E is in position 4? Wait, position 4 is allowed. But we have D at the end? And we don't know about O, B, D.

- ""robes"": as I thought earlier: R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), S(5). E is in position 4, which is allowed. R in position 1, which is allowed. We test O, B, S.

- ""ropes"": R(1), O(2), P(3), E(4), S(5). Similar.

- ""rides"": R(1), I(2), D(3), E(4), S(5). But R is in position 1, E in position 4. We test I, D, S.

- ""riles"": R(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). Same.

But note: in all these, we are putting R in position 1. What if R is not in position 1? Then we will get a '-' for R, and we know it must be in 3,4, or 5.

Alternatively, we can put R in position 3 or 4 to test other possibilities.

For example, ""wired"": W(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). But E is in position 4, which is allowed. R is in position 3, which is allowed. We test W, I, D.

But W is not very common.

""fired"": F(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). Same.

""hired"": H(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), D(5).

But we might get more information if we use more common letters.

Another idea: since we have two letters to place (R and E) and three new letters, we should choose common letters for the other positions.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, L, N, O, I, D, etc.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and must be valid.

I think ""risen"" is a good candidate: R in 1, I in 2, S in 3, E in 4, N in 5. This tests R in position 1, E in position 4, and also tests I, S, N.

But note: we know that E is not in position 5, but in ""risen"", E is in position 4, which is fine. And R is in position 1, which is not the second position (which we know is wrong for R).

Alternatively, ""robin"" but ""robin"" doesn't have E? We know the word must have E, so we must include E.

So we must have both R and E.

Another word: ""reign"" - R(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5). This has E in position 2, which is allowed. And R in position 1. We test I, G, N.

But we don't know if E can be in position 2. It might be, or it might not.

Similarly, we can try ""reins"" - R(1), E(2), I(3), N(4), S(5). But E is in position 2 and we have S at the end. But note: we know E is not in position 5, but in this word, E is in position 2, so that's allowed.

But in ""reins"", we have E in position 2. If the secret word has E in position 2, we get a check. If not, we get a '-'.

But we also have R in position 1.

I think either ""risen"" or ""reign"" or ""ropes"" are fine.

But let me consider the feedback we got: in the first guess, R was in position 2 and was marked as wrong position. That means R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 1, and if it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R must be in position 3,4, or 5.

Similarly for E: it was in position 5 and was wrong, so if we put E in position 4 (like in ""risen"") and it is correct, we get a check; if not, we get a '-' and then we know E must be in position 1,2, or 3.

So to maximize information, we might want to test R in a new position and E in a new position.

But we have limited tries.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has R and E and also includes other common letters that we haven't eliminated.

I think ""ropes"" is a good choice: R in 1, O in 2, P in 3, E in 4, S in 5. We test O, P, S, and also the positions for R and E.

But note: we know that the secret word does not have A, C, T, so we are safe.

Another common word: ""lives"" but that has V and S, and no R? We must include R and E.

""liver"" - L, I, V, E, R. This has E in position 4 and R in position 5. So E is in position 4 (allowed) and R in position 5 (allowed, since we only know it's not in position 2). We test L, I, V.

But V is less common.

I think ""ropes"" is better.

But let me check if ""ropes"" is valid: yes.

We could also use ""roses"", but that has S twice? And we don't know about S. But ""roses"" has R in 1, O in 2, S in 3, E in 4, S in 5. But we have two S's. It might be okay, but we don't know if the word has S.

But we are trying to test multiple letters.

To avoid duplication, ""ropes"" has unique letters: R, O, P, E, S. That's good.

Similarly, ""risen"" has R, I, S, E, N.

I think I'll go with ""risen"" because it includes I, S, N which are common.

But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was absent, so we avoid A. But we haven't tested I, S, N.

So ""risen"" seems good.

But let me see: we have R in position 1 (which might be correct or not), and E in position 4.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Another word: ""renew"" but that has W and two E's? Not ideal.

I think ""risen"" is a solid choice.

But wait, we know that the secret word has R and E, and we are putting R in 1 and E in 4. If the secret word has R in 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus. Similarly for E.

Also, we test I in position 2, S in position 3, N in position 5.

We know that position 2 was R in the first guess and was wrong, but now we are putting I there. It might be correct or not.

So I'll go with ""risen"".

But let me confirm: the word ""risen"" is valid.

So my next guess is ""risen"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":
- C, A, T are **absent** from the secret word.
- R is **present** but not in position 2.
- E is **present** but not in position 5.

For the second guess:
- The word must include **R** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).
- It must **exclude** C, A, T (since they are absent).
- R cannot be placed in position 2 (as per feedback).
- E cannot be placed in position 5 (as per feedback).
- To maximize information, the guess should test new common letters (e.g., S, I, N) and place R and E in positions not yet ruled out (e.g., R in position 1 or 3–5; E in positions 1–4).

The word **""risen""** is chosen because:
- It includes R (position 1) and E (position 4), both in allowed positions.
- It tests new common letters: I (position 2), S (position 3), and N (position 5).
- It avoids C, A, T.
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R and E while providing information on I, S, and N.",Guess 2: risen -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) S(-) E(-) N(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,SPERM,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Alright, the user is asking me to make my first guess in what seems like a word-guessing game similar to Wordle. Since it's the first turn and I have zero information, I need a strategic starting word. 

Hmm... optimal first guesses usually prioritize common letters and vowel-consonant balance to maximize information gain. Words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" come to mind—they're popular among enthusiasts because they cover frequent letters and include vowels. 

But wait, should I pick something that includes ""S""? Many plurals end with S, but since the word is exactly 5 letters, ending with S might be less likely. Alternatively, ""ADIEU"" focuses on vowels but leaves out common consonants. 

After some thought, ""CRATE"" feels balanced: it has two vowels (A,E) and three consonants (C,R,T) which all appear frequently in English. The letters C, R, A, T, and E give good coverage across different positions. Plus, none are overly rare—like Q or Z. 

This choice should likely reveal several hits or misses, especially since E and T are among the most common letters. If I get feedback showing correct positions or existing letters elsewhere, future guesses will narrow down faster. 

I'll commit to ""CRATE"" for now—it's methodical enough to set up the next move efficiently.I'm starting with ""CRATE"" because it's a balanced word containing common letters: 
- **C**, **R**, **T** are frequent consonants  
- **A** and **E** are the most common vowels  
This maximizes the chance of revealing correct letters/positions early.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crate"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C, A, T are not in the secret word at all.
- The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position.
- The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

Therefore, the secret word must contain R and E, and does not contain C, A, or T.

We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, A, T (since they are absent)
- Must include R and E (since they are present, but in different positions)
- We also know that R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5.

We can use this information to form our next guess.

Let's think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, T.

Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

Possible letters to consider: We have 26 letters, minus C, A, T, so 23 left. But we also know the word has R and E.

We should try to cover more common letters to get more information.

Common consonants besides R: S, L, N, etc. Common vowels: E (we already have), and then O, I, U.

We also know that R is in the word but not in position 2. So R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: the word is 5 letters.

Similarly, E is in the word but not in position 5, so E could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We should avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5 in our next guess.

Let's try to think of words that have R and E, and also include other common letters we haven't tried yet, such as S, L, N, O, I, etc.

Some candidate words:

- ""robes"": but has S? Let's check: R in position 1 (which is allowed, since we don't know if R is in 1 or not), O, B, E, S. But we don't know about B and S. Also, E is in position 4 (not 5, so that's allowed). However, we don't know if O, B, S are in the word.

But note: we have to avoid A, C, T. ""robes"" doesn't have A, C, T. So it's a candidate.

But we might want to use a word that has more common letters to maximize information.

Another candidate: ""risen"" - R in position 1, I, S, E, N. E is in position 4. This avoids A, C, T.

But we know that in the first guess, R was in position 2 and was marked as wrong position. Now we are putting R in position 1. It might be that R is actually in position 1? Or it might be in 3,4,5. We don't know.

Alternatively, we could try to put R in a different position to test.

But note: we have two letters we know: R and E. We should try to place them in positions we haven't ruled out.

We also have three other positions to guess. We should try to use new common letters.

Another idea: ""reign"" - R in 1, E in 2, I, G, N. But E is in position 2? We don't know if E can be in position 2. The feedback only said E is not in position 5, so position 2 is allowed. Similarly, R in position 1 is allowed.

But we have to remember that R was originally in position 2 and was wrong. Now we are moving R to position 1. If the secret word has R in position 1, then we would get a check. If not, then we know R is in 3,4, or 5.

Similarly, E was in position 5 and was wrong, now we put it in position 2. If it's correct, we get a check; if not, then we know it's in 3 or 4.

But we also want to test other letters.

Another candidate: ""liner"" - L, I, N, E, R. But note: E is in position 4 and R in position 5. This avoids A, C, T. Also, we haven't tried L, I, N.

But we have to be cautious: if we put R in position 5, that might be a new position. Similarly, E in position 4.

However, we know that E cannot be in position 5, but position 4 is allowed. And R cannot be in position 2, but position 5 is allowed.

But note: the word ""liner"" has R at the end. That might be a good test.

But let me think of more words.

Another common word: ""rouse"" - R in 1, O, U, S, E. E in position 5? Wait, we cannot put E in position 5 because we know E is not in position 5. So ""rouse"" has E in position 5 -> invalid because we know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5, so we can have E in other positions. But if we put E in position 5, we know it will be marked as wrong position (if the word has E) or absent? But we know E is present, so if we put it in position 5, it will be marked as '-' (wrong position) because we know it's not in position 5. But that doesn't give new information. So it's better to put E in a position that we haven't tried and that is allowed (1,2,3,4).

Similarly for R: avoid position 2.

So ""rouse"" is not ideal because E is in position 5.

We can try ""rodes"" or ""rides"", but we don't know about D or S.

Another idea: ""resin"" - R in 1, E in 2, S, I, N. This has E in position 2 and R in position 1. It avoids A, C, T.

But we might also consider ""rinse"" - R in 1, I, N, S, E. E in position 5? Again, we know E is not in position 5, so we avoid that.

So ""rinse"" is not good because of E at the end.

Similarly, ""risen"" has E in position 4: R(1), I(2), S(3), E(4), N(5). That seems okay.

But in ""risen"", R is in position 1 and E in position 4.

We also have the letter I, S, N to test.

Alternatively, we can try a word that puts R in a different position, say position 3 or 4.

For example, ""beryl"" - B, E, R, Y, L. But we don't know about B, Y, L. And E is in position 2, R in position 3.

This avoids A, C, T.

But ""beryl"" is a less common word? We should stick to common words.

Another common word: ""peril"" - P, E, R, I, L. E in position 2, R in position 3. Avoids A, C, T.

But we haven't tested P, I, L.

We could also try ""urged"" - U, R, G, E, D. But U and G and D are less common? And E is in position 4, R in position 2? Wait, we cannot put R in position 2 because we know R is not in position 2. So ""urged"" has R in position 2 -> that would be invalid because we know R is not in position 2. So we must avoid putting R in position 2.

Similarly, we must avoid E in position 5.

So in our next guess, R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.

Let me list some words that have R and E, and avoid A, C, T, and with R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.

Possible words:

- ""robed"": R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), D(5) -> but E is in position 4? Wait, position 4 is allowed. But we have D at the end? And we don't know about O, B, D.

- ""robes"": as I thought earlier: R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), S(5). E is in position 4, which is allowed. R in position 1, which is allowed. We test O, B, S.

- ""ropes"": R(1), O(2), P(3), E(4), S(5). Similar.

- ""rides"": R(1), I(2), D(3), E(4), S(5). But R is in position 1, E in position 4. We test I, D, S.

- ""riles"": R(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). Same.

But note: in all these, we are putting R in position 1. What if R is not in position 1? Then we will get a '-' for R, and we know it must be in 3,4, or 5.

Alternatively, we can put R in position 3 or 4 to test other possibilities.

For example, ""wired"": W(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). But E is in position 4, which is allowed. R is in position 3, which is allowed. We test W, I, D.

But W is not very common.

""fired"": F(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). Same.

""hired"": H(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), D(5).

But we might get more information if we use more common letters.

Another idea: since we have two letters to place (R and E) and three new letters, we should choose common letters for the other positions.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, L, N, O, I, D, etc.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and must be valid.

I think ""risen"" is a good candidate: R in 1, I in 2, S in 3, E in 4, N in 5. This tests R in position 1, E in position 4, and also tests I, S, N.

But note: we know that E is not in position 5, but in ""risen"", E is in position 4, which is fine. And R is in position 1, which is not the second position (which we know is wrong for R).

Alternatively, ""robin"" but ""robin"" doesn't have E? We know the word must have E, so we must include E.

So we must have both R and E.

Another word: ""reign"" - R(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5). This has E in position 2, which is allowed. And R in position 1. We test I, G, N.

But we don't know if E can be in position 2. It might be, or it might not.

Similarly, we can try ""reins"" - R(1), E(2), I(3), N(4), S(5). But E is in position 2 and we have S at the end. But note: we know E is not in position 5, but in this word, E is in position 2, so that's allowed.

But in ""reins"", we have E in position 2. If the secret word has E in position 2, we get a check. If not, we get a '-'.

But we also have R in position 1.

I think either ""risen"" or ""reign"" or ""ropes"" are fine.

But let me consider the feedback we got: in the first guess, R was in position 2 and was marked as wrong position. That means R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 1, and if it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R must be in position 3,4, or 5.

Similarly for E: it was in position 5 and was wrong, so if we put E in position 4 (like in ""risen"") and it is correct, we get a check; if not, we get a '-' and then we know E must be in position 1,2, or 3.

So to maximize information, we might want to test R in a new position and E in a new position.

But we have limited tries.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has R and E and also includes other common letters that we haven't eliminated.

I think ""ropes"" is a good choice: R in 1, O in 2, P in 3, E in 4, S in 5. We test O, P, S, and also the positions for R and E.

But note: we know that the secret word does not have A, C, T, so we are safe.

Another common word: ""lives"" but that has V and S, and no R? We must include R and E.

""liver"" - L, I, V, E, R. This has E in position 4 and R in position 5. So E is in position 4 (allowed) and R in position 5 (allowed, since we only know it's not in position 2). We test L, I, V.

But V is less common.

I think ""ropes"" is better.

But let me check if ""ropes"" is valid: yes.

We could also use ""roses"", but that has S twice? And we don't know about S. But ""roses"" has R in 1, O in 2, S in 3, E in 4, S in 5. But we have two S's. It might be okay, but we don't know if the word has S.

But we are trying to test multiple letters.

To avoid duplication, ""ropes"" has unique letters: R, O, P, E, S. That's good.

Similarly, ""risen"" has R, I, S, E, N.

I think I'll go with ""risen"" because it includes I, S, N which are common.

But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was absent, so we avoid A. But we haven't tested I, S, N.

So ""risen"" seems good.

But let me see: we have R in position 1 (which might be correct or not), and E in position 4.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Another word: ""renew"" but that has W and two E's? Not ideal.

I think ""risen"" is a solid choice.

But wait, we know that the secret word has R and E, and we are putting R in 1 and E in 4. If the secret word has R in 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus. Similarly for E.

Also, we test I in position 2, S in position 3, N in position 5.

We know that position 2 was R in the first guess and was wrong, but now we are putting I there. It might be correct or not.

So I'll go with ""risen"".

But let me confirm: the word ""risen"" is valid.

So my next guess is ""risen"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":
- C, A, T are **absent** from the secret word.
- R is **present** but not in position 2.
- E is **present** but not in position 5.

For the second guess:
- The word must include **R** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).
- It must **exclude** C, A, T (since they are absent).
- R cannot be placed in position 2 (as per feedback).
- E cannot be placed in position 5 (as per feedback).
- To maximize information, the guess should test new common letters (e.g., S, I, N) and place R and E in positions not yet ruled out (e.g., R in position 1 or 3–5; E in positions 1–4).

The word **""risen""** is chosen because:
- It includes R (position 1) and E (position 4), both in allowed positions.
- It tests new common letters: I (position 2), S (position 3), and N (position 5).
- It avoids C, A, T.
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R and E while providing information on I, S, and N.

Since it\'s the first turn and I have zero information, I need a strategic starting word. \n\nHmm... optimal first guesses usually prioritize common letters and vowel-consonant balance to maximize information gain. Words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" come to mind—they\'re popular among enthusiasts because they cover frequent letters and include vowels. \n\nBut wait, should I pick something that includes ""S""? Many plurals end with S, but since the word is exactly 5 letters, ending with S might be less likely. Alternatively, ""ADIEU"" focuses on vowels but leaves out common consonants. \n\nAfter some thought, ""CRATE"" feels balanced: it has two vowels (A,E) and three consonants (C,R,T) which all appear frequently in English. The letters C, R, A, T, and E give good coverage across different positions. Plus, none are overly rare—like Q or Z. \n\nThis choice should likely reveal several hits or misses, especially since E and T are among the most common letters. If I get feedback showing correct positions or existing letters elsewhere, future guesses will narrow down faster. \n\nI\'ll commit to ""CRATE"" for now—it\'s methodical enough to set up the next move efficiently.I\'m starting with ""CRATE"" because it\'s a balanced word containing common letters: \n- **C**, **R**, **T** are frequent consonants  \n- **A** and **E** are the most common vowels  \nThis maximizes the chance of revealing correct letters/positions early.\n\n<guess>crate</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""crate"":\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The letters C, A, T are not in the secret word at all.\n- The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position.\n- The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must contain R and E, and does not contain C, A, or T.\n\nWe have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.\n\nWe need to choose a new 5-letter word that:\n- Does not contain C, A, T (since they are absent)\n- Must include R and E (since they are present, but in different positions)\n- We also know that R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5.\n\nWe can use this information to form our next guess.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, T.\n\nAlso, note that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nPossible letters to consider: We have 26 letters, minus C, A, T, so 23 left.

So R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: the word is 5 letters.\n\nSimilarly, E is in the word but not in position 5, so E could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWe should avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5 in our next guess.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that have R and E, and also include other common letters we haven\'t tried yet, such as S, L, N, O, I, etc.\n\nSome candidate words:\n\n- ""robes"": but has S? Let\'s check: R in position 1 (which is allowed, since we don\'t know if R is in 1 or not), O, B, E, S. But we don\'t know about B and S. Also, E is in position 4 (not 5, so that\'s allowed). However, we don\'t know if O, B, S are in the word.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid A, C, T. ""robes"" doesn\'t have A, C, T. So it\'s a candidate.\n\nBut we might want to use a word that has more common letters to maximize information.\n\nAnother candidate: ""risen"" - R in position 1, I, S, E, N. E is in position 4. This avoids A, C, T.\n\nBut we know that in the first guess, R was in position 2 and was marked as wrong position. Now we are putting R in position 1. It might be that R is actually in position 1? Or it might be in 3,4,5. We don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to put R in a different position to test.\n\nBut note: we have two letters we know: R and E. We should try to place them in positions we haven\'t ruled out.\n\nWe also have three other positions to guess. We should try to use new common letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""reign"" - R in 1, E in 2, I, G, N. But E is in position 2? We don\'t know if E can be in position 2. The feedback only said E is not in position 5, so position 2 is allowed. Similarly, R in position 1 is allowed.\n\nBut we have to remember that R was originally in position 2 and was wrong. Now we are moving R to position 1. If the secret word has R in position 1, then we would get a check. If not, then we know R is in 3,4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, E was in position 5 and was wrong, now we put it in position 2. If it\'s correct, we get a check; if not, then we know it\'s in 3 or 4.\n\nBut we also want to test other letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""liner"" - L, I, N, E, R. But note: E is in position 4 and R in position 5. This avoids A, C, T. Also, we haven\'t tried L, I, N.\n\nBut we have to be cautious: if we put R in position 5, that might be a new position. Similarly, E in position 4.\n\nHowever, we know that E cannot be in position 5, but position 4 is allowed. And R cannot be in position 2, but position 5 is allowed.\n\nBut note: the word ""liner"" has R at the end. That might be a good test.\n\nBut let me think of more words.\n\nAnother common word: ""rouse"" - R in 1, O, U, S, E. E in position 5? Wait, we cannot put E in position 5 because we know E is not in position 5. So ""rouse"" has E in position 5 -> invalid because we know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5, so we can have E in other positions. But if we put E in position 5, we know it will be marked as wrong position (if the word has E) or absent? But we know E is present, so if we put it in position 5, it will be marked as \'-\' (wrong position) because we know it\'s not in position 5. But that doesn\'t give new information. So it\'s better to put E in a position that we haven\'t tried and that is allowed (1,2,3,4).\n\nSimilarly for R: avoid position 2.\n\nSo ""rouse"" is not ideal because E is in position 5.\n\nWe can try ""rodes"" or ""rides"", but we don\'t know about D or S.\n\nAnother idea: ""resin"" - R in 1, E in 2, S, I, N. This has E in position 2 and R in position 1. It avoids A, C, T.\n\nBut we might also consider ""rinse"" - R in 1, I, N, S, E. E in position 5? Again, we know E is not in position 5, so we avoid that.\n\nSo ""rinse"" is not good because of E at the end.\n\nSimilarly, ""risen"" has E in position 4: R(1), I(2), S(3), E(4), N(5). That seems okay.\n\nBut in ""risen"", R is in position 1 and E in position 4.\n\nWe also have the letter I, S, N to test.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that puts R in a different position, say position 3 or 4.\n\nFor example, ""beryl"" - B, E, R, Y, L. But we don\'t know about B, Y, L. And E is in position 2, R in position 3.\n\nThis avoids A, C, T.\n\nBut ""beryl"" is a less common word? We should stick to common words.\n\nAnother common word: ""peril"" - P, E, R, I, L. E in position 2, R in position 3. Avoids A, C, T.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested P, I, L.\n\nWe could also try ""urged"" - U, R, G, E, D. But U and G and D are less common? And E is in position 4, R in position 2? Wait, we cannot put R in position 2 because we know R is not in position 2. So ""urged"" has R in position 2 -> that would be invalid because we know R is not in position 2. So we must avoid putting R in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid E in position 5.\n\nSo in our next guess, R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.\n\nLet me list some words that have R and E, and avoid A, C, T, and with R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""robed"": R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), D(5) -> but E is in position 4? Wait, position 4 is allowed. But we have D at the end? And we don\'t know about O, B, D.\n\n- ""robes"": as I thought earlier: R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), S(5). E is in position 4, which is allowed. R in position 1, which is allowed. We test O, B, S.\n\n- ""ropes"": R(1), O(2), P(3), E(4), S(5). Similar.\n\n- ""rides"": R(1), I(2), D(3), E(4), S(5). But R is in position 1, E in position 4. We test I, D, S.\n\n- ""riles"": R(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). Same.\n\nBut note: in all these, we are putting R in position 1. What if R is not in position 1? Then we will get a \'-\' for R, and we know it must be in 3,4, or 5.\n\nAlternatively, we can put R in position 3 or 4 to test other possibilities.\n\nFor example, ""wired"": W(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). But E is in position 4, which is allowed. R is in position 3, which is allowed. We test W, I, D.\n\nBut W is not very common.\n\n""fired"": F(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). Same.\n\n""hired"": H(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), D(5).\n\nBut we might get more information if we use more common letters.\n\nAnother idea: since we have two letters to place (R and E) and three new letters, we should choose common letters for the other positions.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: S, L, N, O, I, D, etc.\n\nWe also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and must be valid.\n\nI think ""risen"" is a good candidate: R in 1, I in 2, S in 3, E in 4, N in 5. This tests R in position 1, E in position 4, and also tests I, S, N.\n\nBut note: we know that E is not in position 5, but in ""risen"", E is in position 4, which is fine. And R is in position 1, which is not the second position (which we know is wrong for R).\n\nAlternatively, ""robin"" but ""robin"" doesn\'t have E? We know the word must have E, so we must include E.\n\nSo we must have both R and E.\n\nAnother word: ""reign"" - R(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5). This has E in position 2, which is allowed. And R in position 1. We test I, G, N.\n\nBut we don\'t know if E can be in position 2. It might be, or it might not.\n\nSimilarly, we can try ""reins"" - R(1), E(2), I(3), N(4), S(5). But E is in position 2 and we have S at the end. But note: we know E is not in position 5, but in this word, E is in position 2, so that\'s allowed.\n\nBut in ""reins"", we have E in position 2. If the secret word has E in position 2, we get a check. If not, we get a \'-\'.\n\nBut we also have R in position 1.\n\nI think either ""risen"" or ""reign"" or ""ropes"" are fine.\n\nBut let me consider the feedback we got: in the first guess, R was in position 2 and was marked as wrong position. That means R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 1, and if it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know R must be in position 3,4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly for E: it was in position 5 and was wrong, so if we put E in position 4 (like in ""risen"") and it is correct, we get a check; if not, we get a \'-\' and then we know E must be in position 1,2, or 3.\n\nSo to maximize information, we might want to test R in a new position and E in a new position.\n\nBut we have limited tries.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has R and E and also includes other common letters that we haven\'t eliminated.\n\nI think ""ropes"" is a good choice: R in 1, O in 2, P in 3, E in 4, S in 5. We test O, P, S, and also the positions for R and E.\n\nBut note: we know that the secret word does not have A, C, T, so we are safe.\n\nAnother common word: ""lives"" but that has V and S, and no R? We must include R and E.\n\n""liver"" - L, I, V, E, R. This has E in position 4 and R in position 5. So E is in position 4 (allowed) and R in position 5 (allowed, since we only know it\'s not in position 2). We test L, I, V.\n\nBut V is less common.\n\nI think ""ropes"" is better.\n\nBut let me check if ""ropes"" is valid: yes.\n\nWe could also use ""roses"", but that has S twice? And we don\'t know about S. But ""roses"" has R in 1, O in 2, S in 3, E in 4, S in 5. But we have two S\'s. It might be okay, but we don\'t know if the word has S.\n\nBut we are trying to test multiple letters.\n\nTo avoid duplication, ""ropes"" has unique letters: R, O, P, E, S. That\'s good.\n\nSimilarly, ""risen"" has R, I, S, E, N.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""risen"" because it includes I, S, N which are common.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was absent, so we avoid A. But we haven\'t tested I, S, N.\n\nSo ""risen"" seems good.\n\nBut let me see: we have R in position 1 (which might be correct or not), and E in position 4.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nAnother word: ""renew"" but that has W and two E\'s? Not ideal.\n\nI think ""risen"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut wait, we know that the secret word has R and E, and we are putting R in 1 and E in 4. If the secret word has R in 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus. Similarly for E.\n\nAlso, we test I in position 2, S in position 3, N in position 5.\n\nWe know that position 2 was R in the first guess and was wrong, but now we are putting I there. It might be correct or not.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""risen"".\n\nBut let me confirm: the word ""risen"" is valid.\n\nSo my next guess is ""risen"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":\n- C, A, T are **absent** from the secret word.\n- R is **present** but not in position 2.\n- E is **present** but not in position 5.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include **R** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).\n- It must **exclude** C, A, T (since they are absent).\n- R cannot be placed in position 2 (as per feedback).\n- E cannot be placed in position 5 (as per feedback).\n- To maximize information, the guess should test new common letters (e.g., S, I, N) and place R and E in positions not yet ruled out (e.g., R in position 1 or 3–5; E in positions 1–4).\n\nThe word **""risen""** is chosen because:\n- It includes R (position 1) and E (position 4), both in allowed positions.\n- It tests new common letters: I (position 2), S (position 3), and N (position 5).\n- It avoids C, A, T.\n- It is a valid English word.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of R and E while providing information on I, S, and N.\n\n<guess>risen</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: risen -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) S(-) E(-) N(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crate""
- C: absent (x)
- R: present, but not in position 2 (-)
- A: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)
- E: present, but not in position 5 (-)

Guess 2: ""risen""
- R: present, but not in position 1 (-) [since it was in position 1 and marked as wrong position]
- I: absent (x)
- S: present, but not in position 3 (-)
- E: present, but not in position 4 (-) [now we know E is not in position 4 or 5]
- N: absent (x)

From this, we can deduce:

1. **Confirmed absent letters:** C, A, T, I, N
2. **Confirmed present letters:** R, E, S (since they were marked present in at least one guess)
3. **Position constraints:**
   - R: Not in position 2 (from guess 1) and not in position 1 (from guess 2). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
   - E: Not in position 5 (from guess 1) and not in position 4 (from guess 2). So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
   - S: Not in position 3 (from guess 2). So S must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Additionally, we know the secret word must contain R, E, and S, and it has exactly 5 letters.

We have used 2 guesses and have 4 remaining.

We need to choose a new word that:
- Includes R, E, S (since they are present)
- Excludes C, A, T, I, N (absent)
- Places R in one of positions 3,4,5
- Places E in one of positions 1,2,3
- Places S in one of positions 1,2,4,5 (avoiding position 3)
- Uses new letters to test for other possible present letters (since we only have 3 confirmed, and the word has 5 letters, so there are 2 more letters to discover)

Common letters not yet tested: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should aim to cover common letters to maximize information.

Let's think of words that fit the constraints.

Possible structure:

- E must be in 1,2,3
- R must be in 3,4,5
- S must be in 1,2,4,5

We also need to avoid positions that are ruled out for each.

One idea: Place E in position 1, then R in position 3 or 4 or 5, and S in position 2,4,5 (but not conflicting).

For example:
- Position 1: E (if we try E in position 1)
- Position 2: S? But S can be in 2, and E in 1 is allowed.
- Then R in 3,4, or 5.

But we need two more letters.

Alternatively, place E in position 2, then R in 3,4,5 and S in 1,4,5.

Let's list possible words:

Try E in position 1:
- E _ _ _ _
  - Then we can have S in position 2: E S _ _ _
    - Then R in 3,4,5: e.g., E S R _ _ (but R in 3) -> but we need two more letters, and avoid absent letters.
    - Words: ""ESPRY"" (but Y is less common, and we don't know if P is present) or ""ESKER"" (but K and E again? and we have E already, but it's allowed if the word has two E's? But we don't know if E is repeated. However, in feedback, E was only marked present once, but it could be repeated? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates. So we have to consider that possibility. But to be safe, let's avoid assuming duplicates for now.

But we need to use common words.

Another idea: Place E in position 3, then R in 3? But E and R both in position 3? No, only one letter per position.

E in position 3 and R in position 4 or 5? That could work.

For example: _ _ E R _ 

But S must be in 1,2,4,5. If we put R in 4, then S cannot be in 4, so S in 1,2,5.

Similarly, if E is in 3, then we have positions 1,2 for other letters and 5 for S or R.

Let me try to form words.

We know the word must have R, E, S and two more letters (not C,A,T,I,N).

Common letters: O, L, D, U, etc.

Try a word with E in position 2? That might be promising.

For example: _ E _ _ _

Then R in 3,4,5 and S in 1,4,5.

If we put S in position 1: S E _ _ _

Then R in 3,4,5: e.g., S E R _ _ (R in 3) -> ""SERUM"" (but U and M, and we don't know) or ""SERIF"" (F) or ""SEROW"" (O and W).

But we have to avoid I (absent) so ""SERIF"" has I? No, I is absent, so we cannot use I. ""SERIF"" has I? S-E-R-I-F -> I is the fourth letter, but we know I is absent, so invalid.

Similarly, ""SERUM"" has U and M, which are not tested.

Another possibility: S in position 1, E in position 2, and R in position 5: S E _ _ R

Then the word must have another letter in position 3 and 4, and we have S, E, and R already, but the word must have 5 distinct? Not necessarily, but we don't know.

Words: ""SEWER"" (but E is repeated, and W) or ""SEPIA"" (but A is absent) or ""SEDGE"" (E repeated, D, G).

But we avoid A, so ""SEPIA"" is out.

""SEWER"" has E twice, which is possible.

But let's see if we can avoid duplicates for now.

Place E in position 3.

So: _ _ E _ _

Then R in 3,4,5 -> but position 3 is taken by E, so R in 4 or 5.

S in 1,2,4,5.

Case 1: R in 4: _ _ E R _
  - Then S in 1,2,5: 
    - If S in 1: S _ E R _
    - If S in 2: _ S E R _
    - If S in 5: _ _ E R S

Case 2: R in 5: _ _ E _ R
  - Then S in 1,2,4: 
    - S in 1: S _ E _ R
    - S in 2: _ S E _ R
    - S in 4: _ _ E S R

Now, we need to fill the remaining positions with letters not in {C,A,T,I,N} and common.

Let's try to form words:

For S in 1 and R in 4: S _ E R _
  - Words: ""SOWER"" (O, W, E) -> but E is in position 3, and we have E already? The word has E at 3 and R at 4. ""SOWER"" is S-O-W-E-R -> positions: S(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5) -> but we have E in position 4? But we placed E in position 3, so this doesn't match.

We have fixed E in position 3, so for case 1 (R in 4): the word is _ _ E R _ , so positions: 1,2, E, R, 5.

So for S in 1: S _ E R _ -> we need a letter for position 2 and 5.

Words: ""SUER?"" but not 5 letters. ""SOLER"" (O, L) -> S-O-L-E-R? But that's S(1),O(2),L(3),E(4),R(5) -> but we have E in position 4, but we wanted E in position 3? I think I confused.

If we set E in position 3 and R in position 4, then the word is: [1] [2] E R [5]

So for example, if S is in position 1: S [2] E R [5]

We need letters for position 2 and 5, not C,A,T,I,N.

Possible words: 
- ""SUERS"" (but S repeated and not common) 
- ""SAYER"" (but A is absent) 
- ""SOBER"" (O, B) -> S-O-B-E-R -> S(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), R(5) -> but we have E in position 4, but we set E to be in position 3? This has E in 4, not 3.

I think I made a mistake: if E is in position 3, then position 3 is E. Then R in position 4, so position 4 is R. Then position 1,2,5 to fill.

So the word is: [1] [2] E R [5]

We cannot have a letter in position 3 because it's E, and position 4 is R.

So the word has five positions: 1,2,3=E,4=R,5.

So for example, ""POWER"" is P-O-W-E-R, which is P(1),O(2),W(3),E(4),R(5) -> but that has E in 4, not 3.

We need a word with E in position 3 and R in position 4.

For example: ""LOWER"" is L-O-W-E-R -> E in 4, not 3.

""BOXER"" is B-O-X-E-R -> same.

""DEFER"" is D-E-F-E-R -> E in 2 and 4.

We need a word with the third letter E and fourth letter R.

Examples: ""RULER"" is R-U-L-E-R -> E in 4.

""TIGER"" is T-I-G-E-R -> E in 4.

I'm struggling. Let me think: ""ORDER"" is O-R-D-E-R -> E in 4.

""OFFER"" is O-F-F-E-R -> E in 4.

What about ""OAKER""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""EYERS"" or something, but not common.

Another idea: ""LEVER"" is L-E-V-E-R -> E in 2 and 4.

We need a word with E in position 3.

For example: ""AXLED"" but not common.

Perhaps I should consider other placements.

Let's try E in position 1.

So: E _ _ _ _

Then R in 3,4,5.

S in 2,4,5 (since not 3).

If S in 2: E S _ _ _

Then R in 3,4,5.

If R in 3: E S R _ _ -> ""ESPRY"" (not common) or ""ESTRO"" (not word) or ""ESKER"" (which is a word, meaning a glacial ridge).

""ESKER"" has E(1), S(2), K(3), E(4), R(5) -> but E is repeated, and we have E in position 1 and 4. But we know E is present, and it could be repeated. Also, K is new.

But let's see feedback: in guess 1, E was present but not in 5, and in guess 2, E was present but not in 4. So if the word has two E's, it's possible.

But we can try.

Another word: E in 1, S in 5, and R in 3: E _ R _ S

Words: ""EARLS"" (but A is absent) or ""EERKS"" not word.

""EURES"" not common.

Place E in position 2.

So: _ E _ _ _

Then R in 3,4,5.

S in 1,4,5.

If S in 1: S E _ _ _

Then R in 3,4,5.

If R in 3: S E R _ _ -> ""SERGE"" (G) or ""SERFS"" (F) or ""SEROW"" (O,W)

If R in 4: S E _ R _ -> ""SEORA"" (A absent) or ""SEPIA"" (A absent) or ""SEDGY"" (D,G,Y) or ""SEDGE"" (D,G,E repeated)

If R in 5: S E _ _ R -> ""SEWER"" (W,E repeated) or ""SEIZR"" not word.

Now, with S in 1, E in 2, R in 5: ""SEWER"" is a word, but has E repeated.

But let's avoid duplicates if possible.

Another option: S in 4 or 5.

For example, with E in 2, and S in 4: _ E _ S _

Then R in 3,4,5 -> but S is in 4, so R cannot be in 4, so R in 3 or 5.

If R in 3: _ E R S _ -> ""BERSK"" not word or ""VERSO"" (V,O) or ""PERSU"" not common.

If R in 5: _ E _ S R -> ""MESER"" not common or ""YESES"" S repeated.

With E in 2, S in 5: _ E _ _ S

Then R in 3,4,5 -> but S is in 5, so R in 3 or 4.

If R in 3: _ E R _ S -> ""HEROS"" (H,O) or ""ZEROS"" (Z,O) or ""FERNS"" (F, but N absent) N is absent, so ""FERNS"" has N, which is absent, invalid.

""HEROS"" is H-E-R-O-S, which is valid, and H, O are new.

Similarly, ""DEROS"" not common.

So ""HEROS"" is a possibility.

But we have to check if it meets: E in position 2, R in position 3, S in position 5. And H in 1, O in 4.

Letters: H, E, R, O, S. All not in absent list.

Similarly, another word: ""ZEROS"" but Z is less common.

Or ""MERES"" but E repeated and S at the end, but ""MERES"" is M-E-R-E-S, so E in 2 and 4, R in 3, S in 5.

But E repeated.

To avoid duplication, ""HEROS"" is better.

But ""HEROS"" is a valid word (plural of hero).

Another option: E in position 3.

Let's find a word with E in position 3 and R in position 5, for example.

So: _ _ E _ R

Then S in 1,2,4.

If S in 1: S _ E _ R -> ""SKEER"" not common or ""SPEER"" not or ""SUPER"" (U,P) -> S-U-P-E-R, which is S(1),U(2),P(3),E(4),R(5) -> but we have E in position 4, not 3.

We need E in position 3.

So for ""SUPER"", E is in 4.

What word has E in position 3 and R in position 5? ""LATER"" is L-A-T-E-R, but A and T absent.

""PIPER"" is P-I-P-E-R, I absent.

""BOXER"" B-O-X-E-R, E in 4.

""MAKER"" M-A-K-E-R, A absent.

""USER"" U-S-E-R, but 4 letters.

""BASER"" B-A-S-E-R, A absent.

It's hard. ""OAKER"" not word.

Perhaps ""OGEED"" not word.

Another idea: ""EYRES"" E-Y-R-E-S, but E in 1 and 4.

I think it's difficult to find with E in 3 and R in 5.

Perhaps R in 4 with E in 3: we had the structure [1] [2] E R [5]

Words: ""UMPER"" not word.

""UMBER"" U-M-B-E-R -> but E in 4.

""AMBER"" A absent.

""EMBER"" E-M-B-E-R -> E in 1 and 4, not 3.

I think we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters, or try a different approach.

Let's list all possible positions for the known letters.

R: positions 3,4,5
E: positions 1,2,3
S: positions 1,2,4,5

We need to assign positions that are compatible.

For example:
- If E is in 1, then S can be in 2,4,5 and R in 3,4,5.
- If E is in 2, then S in 1,4,5 and R in 3,4,5.
- If E is in 3, then S in 1,2,4,5 and R in 4,5 (since R cannot be in 3 if E is there).

Also, the positions must be distinct.

Now, let's try to find words that fit.

Start with E in position 1: E _ _ _ _
  - S could be in 2: E S _ _ _
    - R in 3: E S R _ _ -> ""ESPRY"", ""ESKER"", ""ESTER"" (but T absent) T is absent, so ""ESTER"" invalid. ""ESKER"" is valid.
  - S in 4: E _ _ S _
    - R in 3: E _ R S _ -> ""EERSS"" not word or ""EORLS"" not.
    - R in 5: E _ _ S R -> ""EAUSR"" not or ""EMMES"" not.
  - S in 5: E _ _ _ S
    - R in 3: E _ R _ S -> ""EARLS"" A absent, ""EERKS"" not, ""EORDS"" not.
    - R in 4: E _ _ R S -> ""EURES"" not common, ""EILRS"" I absent.

So only ""ESKER"" seems possible for E in 1 and S in 2 and R in 3.

But ""ESKER"" has K, which is new.

Now, E in position 2: _ E _ _ _
  - S in 1: S E _ _ _
    - R in 3: S E R _ _ -> ""SERGE"", ""SERFS"", ""SEROW"", ""SERED"" (D)
    - R in 4: S E _ R _ -> ""SEDER"" (D, but E repeated) or ""SEGAR"" (G, but A absent) or ""SEWAR"" not common.
    - R in 5: S E _ _ R -> ""SEWER"" (W, E repeated), ""SEGGR"" not.
  - S in 4: _ E _ S _
    - R in 3: _ E R S _ -> ""VERSO"" (V,O), ""PERPS"" not, ""HERSE"" (H,E repeated)
    - R in 5: _ E _ S R -> ""MESYR"" not or ""FESOR"" not.
  - S in 5: _ E _ _ S
    - R in 3: _ E R _ S -> ""HEROS"" (H,O), ""DERMS"" (D,M), ""FERNS"" (F,N absent) invalid, ""PERPS"" not.
    - R in 4: _ E _ R S -> ""AEROS"" A absent, ""EERKS"" not, ""LORES"" L,O -> ""LORES"" is L-O-R-E-S, which is L(1),O(2),R(3),E(4),S(5) -> but we have E in position 4, not 2. We need E in position 2.

For ""HEROS"": it is H-E-R-O-S, so H(1), E(2), R(3), O(4), S(5). This fits: E in 2, R in 3, S in 5. And O in 4 and H in 1 are new.

And it avoids absent letters: C,A,T,I,N are absent, and H,O are not in that list.

Similarly, ""DERMS"" is D-E-R-M-S, which is also valid, but M is less common than O.

""HEROS"" is a good choice.

Now, E in position 3: _ _ E _ _
  - S in 1: S _ E _ _
    - R in 4: S _ E R _ -> ""SUPER"" U,P but E in 4? No, we need E in 3. ""SUPER"" is S-U-P-E-R, E in 4.
      We need a word like S ? E R ? with E in 3 and R in 4.
      ""SAYER"" A absent.
      ""SOBER"" O,B -> S-O-B-E-R, but E in 4.
      I can't find one.
    - R in 5: S _ E _ R -> ""SKEER"" not, ""SPEER"" not, ""SUPER"" E in 4.
  - S in 2: _ S E _ _
    - R in 4: _ S E R _ -> ""ASPER"" A absent, ""USHER"" U,H -> U-S-H-E-R, E in 4.
      ""RS."" not.
    - R in 5: _ S E _ R -> ""OSIER"" O,I absent (I is absent), ""USHER"" E in 4.
  - S in 4: _ _ E S _
    - R in 5: _ _ E S R -> ""MESER"" not, ""YESER"" not.
  - S in 5: _ _ E _ S
    - R in 4: _ _ E R S -> ""BERSK"" not, ""VERSO"" V,O -> V-E-R-S-O, which is V(1),E(2),R(3),S(4),O(5) -> but we have E in position 2, not 3. We need E in 3.

So for E in position 3, it's hard to find a common word.

Therefore, the best options are ""ESKER"" or ""HEROS"".

""HEROS"" seems more common than ""ESKER"".

Also, ""HEROS"" tests H and O, which are common.

So I'll go with ""HEROS"".

In ""HEROS"":
- H is new
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (allowed, since R can be in 3,4,5 and not 1 or 2)
- O in position 4
- S in position 5 (allowed, since S not in 3)

And it meets all constraints.

So the guess is ""HEROS"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Absent letters (x)**: C, A, T, I, N (eliminated from consideration).
- **Present letters (-)**: R, E, S (must be included, but in different positions).
- **Position constraints**:
  - R: Not in position 1 (from ""risen"") or 2 (from ""crate""), so must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
  - E: Not in position 4 (from ""risen"") or 5 (from ""crate""), so must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
  - S: Not in position 3 (from ""risen""), so must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

For the next guess:
- The word must include R, E, and S.
- It must exclude C, A, T, I, N.
- To maximize information, the guess should test new common letters (e.g., H, O) and adhere to the position constraints for R, E, and S.

The word **""HEROS""** is chosen because:
- It includes R (position 3), E (position 2), and S (position 5), all in allowed positions.
- It tests new common letters: H (position 1) and O (position 4).
- It avoids all absent letters.
- It is a valid English word (plural of ""hero"").

This guess will help confirm the positions of R, E, and S while providing information on H and O.

<guess>heros</guess>",heros,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crate""
- C: absent (x)
- R: present, but not in position 2 (-)
- A: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)
- E: present, but not in position 5 (-)

Guess 2: ""risen""
- R: present, but not in position 1 (-) [since it was in position 1 and marked as wrong position]
- I: absent (x)
- S: present, but not in position 3 (-)
- E: present, but not in position 4 (-) [now we know E is not in position 4 or 5]
- N: absent (x)

From this, we can deduce:

1. **Confirmed absent letters:** C, A, T, I, N
2. **Confirmed present letters:** R, E, S (since they were marked present in at least one guess)
3. **Position constraints:**
   - R: Not in position 2 (from guess 1) and not in position 1 (from guess 2). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
   - E: Not in position 5 (from guess 1) and not in position 4 (from guess 2). So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
   - S: Not in position 3 (from guess 2). So S must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Additionally, we know the secret word must contain R, E, and S, and it has exactly 5 letters.

We have used 2 guesses and have 4 remaining.

We need to choose a new word that:
- Includes R, E, S (since they are present)
- Excludes C, A, T, I, N (absent)
- Places R in one of positions 3,4,5
- Places E in one of positions 1,2,3
- Places S in one of positions 1,2,4,5 (avoiding position 3)
- Uses new letters to test for other possible present letters (since we only have 3 confirmed, and the word has 5 letters, so there are 2 more letters to discover)

Common letters not yet tested: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should aim to cover common letters to maximize information.

Let's think of words that fit the constraints.

Possible structure:

- E must be in 1,2,3
- R must be in 3,4,5
- S must be in 1,2,4,5

We also need to avoid positions that are ruled out for each.

One idea: Place E in position 1, then R in position 3 or 4 or 5, and S in position 2,4,5 (but not conflicting).

For example:
- Position 1: E (if we try E in position 1)
- Position 2: S? But S can be in 2, and E in 1 is allowed.
- Then R in 3,4, or 5.

But we need two more letters.

Alternatively, place E in position 2, then R in 3,4,5 and S in 1,4,5.

Let's list possible words:

Try E in position 1:
- E _ _ _ _
  - Then we can have S in position 2: E S _ _ _
    - Then R in 3,4,5: e.g., E S R _ _ (but R in 3) -> but we need two more letters, and avoid absent letters.
    - Words: ""ESPRY"" (but Y is less common, and we don't know if P is present) or ""ESKER"" (but K and E again? and we have E already, but it's allowed if the word has two E's? But we don't know if E is repeated. However, in feedback, E was only marked present once, but it could be repeated? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates. So we have to consider that possibility. But to be safe, let's avoid assuming duplicates for now.

But we need to use common words.

Another idea: Place E in position 3, then R in 3? But E and R both in position 3? No, only one letter per position.

E in position 3 and R in position 4 or 5? That could work.

For example: _ _ E R _ 

But S must be in 1,2,4,5. If we put R in 4, then S cannot be in 4, so S in 1,2,5.

Similarly, if E is in 3, then we have positions 1,2 for other letters and 5 for S or R.

Let me try to form words.

We know the word must have R, E, S and two more letters (not C,A,T,I,N).

Common letters: O, L, D, U, etc.

Try a word with E in position 2? That might be promising.

For example: _ E _ _ _

Then R in 3,4,5 and S in 1,4,5.

If we put S in position 1: S E _ _ _

Then R in 3,4,5: e.g., S E R _ _ (R in 3) -> ""SERUM"" (but U and M, and we don't know) or ""SERIF"" (F) or ""SEROW"" (O and W).

But we have to avoid I (absent) so ""SERIF"" has I? No, I is absent, so we cannot use I. ""SERIF"" has I? S-E-R-I-F -> I is the fourth letter, but we know I is absent, so invalid.

Similarly, ""SERUM"" has U and M, which are not tested.

Another possibility: S in position 1, E in position 2, and R in position 5: S E _ _ R

Then the word must have another letter in position 3 and 4, and we have S, E, and R already, but the word must have 5 distinct? Not necessarily, but we don't know.

Words: ""SEWER"" (but E is repeated, and W) or ""SEPIA"" (but A is absent) or ""SEDGE"" (E repeated, D, G).

But we avoid A, so ""SEPIA"" is out.

""SEWER"" has E twice, which is possible.

But let's see if we can avoid duplicates for now.

Place E in position 3.

So: _ _ E _ _

Then R in 3,4,5 -> but position 3 is taken by E, so R in 4 or 5.

S in 1,2,4,5.

Case 1: R in 4: _ _ E R _
  - Then S in 1,2,5: 
    - If S in 1: S _ E R _
    - If S in 2: _ S E R _
    - If S in 5: _ _ E R S

Case 2: R in 5: _ _ E _ R
  - Then S in 1,2,4: 
    - S in 1: S _ E _ R
    - S in 2: _ S E _ R
    - S in 4: _ _ E S R

Now, we need to fill the remaining positions with letters not in {C,A,T,I,N} and common.

Let's try to form words:

For S in 1 and R in 4: S _ E R _
  - Words: ""SOWER"" (O, W, E) -> but E is in position 3, and we have E already? The word has E at 3 and R at 4. ""SOWER"" is S-O-W-E-R -> positions: S(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5) -> but we have E in position 4? But we placed E in position 3, so this doesn't match.

We have fixed E in position 3, so for case 1 (R in 4): the word is _ _ E R _ , so positions: 1,2, E, R, 5.

So for S in 1: S _ E R _ -> we need a letter for position 2 and 5.

Words: ""SUER?"" but not 5 letters. ""SOLER"" (O, L) -> S-O-L-E-R? But that's S(1),O(2),L(3),E(4),R(5) -> but we have E in position 4, but we wanted E in position 3? I think I confused.

If we set E in position 3 and R in position 4, then the word is: [1] [2] E R [5]

So for example, if S is in position 1: S [2] E R [5]

We need letters for position 2 and 5, not C,A,T,I,N.

Possible words: 
- ""SUERS"" (but S repeated and not common) 
- ""SAYER"" (but A is absent) 
- ""SOBER"" (O, B) -> S-O-B-E-R -> S(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), R(5) -> but we have E in position 4, but we set E to be in position 3? This has E in 4, not 3.

I think I made a mistake: if E is in position 3, then position 3 is E. Then R in position 4, so position 4 is R. Then position 1,2,5 to fill.

So the word is: [1] [2] E R [5]

We cannot have a letter in position 3 because it's E, and position 4 is R.

So the word has five positions: 1,2,3=E,4=R,5.

So for example, ""POWER"" is P-O-W-E-R, which is P(1),O(2),W(3),E(4),R(5) -> but that has E in 4, not 3.

We need a word with E in position 3 and R in position 4.

For example: ""LOWER"" is L-O-W-E-R -> E in 4, not 3.

""BOXER"" is B-O-X-E-R -> same.

""DEFER"" is D-E-F-E-R -> E in 2 and 4.

We need a word with the third letter E and fourth letter R.

Examples: ""RULER"" is R-U-L-E-R -> E in 4.

""TIGER"" is T-I-G-E-R -> E in 4.

I'm struggling. Let me think: ""ORDER"" is O-R-D-E-R -> E in 4.

""OFFER"" is O-F-F-E-R -> E in 4.

What about ""OAKER""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""EYERS"" or something, but not common.

Another idea: ""LEVER"" is L-E-V-E-R -> E in 2 and 4.

We need a word with E in position 3.

For example: ""AXLED"" but not common.

Perhaps I should consider other placements.

Let's try E in position 1.

So: E _ _ _ _

Then R in 3,4,5.

S in 2,4,5 (since not 3).

If S in 2: E S _ _ _

Then R in 3,4,5.

If R in 3: E S R _ _ -> ""ESPRY"" (not common) or ""ESTRO"" (not word) or ""ESKER"" (which is a word, meaning a glacial ridge).

""ESKER"" has E(1), S(2), K(3), E(4), R(5) -> but E is repeated, and we have E in position 1 and 4. But we know E is present, and it could be repeated. Also, K is new.

But let's see feedback: in guess 1, E was present but not in 5, and in guess 2, E was present but not in 4. So if the word has two E's, it's possible.

But we can try.

Another word: E in 1, S in 5, and R in 3: E _ R _ S

Words: ""EARLS"" (but A is absent) or ""EERKS"" not word.

""EURES"" not common.

Place E in position 2.

So: _ E _ _ _

Then R in 3,4,5.

S in 1,4,5.

If S in 1: S E _ _ _

Then R in 3,4,5.

If R in 3: S E R _ _ -> ""SERGE"" (G) or ""SERFS"" (F) or ""SEROW"" (O,W)

If R in 4: S E _ R _ -> ""SEORA"" (A absent) or ""SEPIA"" (A absent) or ""SEDGY"" (D,G,Y) or ""SEDGE"" (D,G,E repeated)

If R in 5: S E _ _ R -> ""SEWER"" (W,E repeated) or ""SEIZR"" not word.

Now, with S in 1, E in 2, R in 5: ""SEWER"" is a word, but has E repeated.

But let's avoid duplicates if possible.

Another option: S in 4 or 5.

For example, with E in 2, and S in 4: _ E _ S _

Then R in 3,4,5 -> but S is in 4, so R cannot be in 4, so R in 3 or 5.

If R in 3: _ E R S _ -> ""BERSK"" not word or ""VERSO"" (V,O) or ""PERSU"" not common.

If R in 5: _ E _ S R -> ""MESER"" not common or ""YESES"" S repeated.

With E in 2, S in 5: _ E _ _ S

Then R in 3,4,5 -> but S is in 5, so R in 3 or 4.

If R in 3: _ E R _ S -> ""HEROS"" (H,O) or ""ZEROS"" (Z,O) or ""FERNS"" (F, but N absent) N is absent, so ""FERNS"" has N, which is absent, invalid.

""HEROS"" is H-E-R-O-S, which is valid, and H, O are new.

Similarly, ""DEROS"" not common.

So ""HEROS"" is a possibility.

But we have to check if it meets: E in position 2, R in position 3, S in position 5. And H in 1, O in 4.

Letters: H, E, R, O, S. All not in absent list.

Similarly, another word: ""ZEROS"" but Z is less common.

Or ""MERES"" but E repeated and S at the end, but ""MERES"" is M-E-R-E-S, so E in 2 and 4, R in 3, S in 5.

But E repeated.

To avoid duplication, ""HEROS"" is better.

But ""HEROS"" is a valid word (plural of hero).

Another option: E in position 3.

Let's find a word with E in position 3 and R in position 5, for example.

So: _ _ E _ R

Then S in 1,2,4.

If S in 1: S _ E _ R -> ""SKEER"" not common or ""SPEER"" not or ""SUPER"" (U,P) -> S-U-P-E-R, which is S(1),U(2),P(3),E(4),R(5) -> but we have E in position 4, not 3.

We need E in position 3.

So for ""SUPER"", E is in 4.

What word has E in position 3 and R in position 5? ""LATER"" is L-A-T-E-R, but A and T absent.

""PIPER"" is P-I-P-E-R, I absent.

""BOXER"" B-O-X-E-R, E in 4.

""MAKER"" M-A-K-E-R, A absent.

""USER"" U-S-E-R, but 4 letters.

""BASER"" B-A-S-E-R, A absent.

It's hard. ""OAKER"" not word.

Perhaps ""OGEED"" not word.

Another idea: ""EYRES"" E-Y-R-E-S, but E in 1 and 4.

I think it's difficult to find with E in 3 and R in 5.

Perhaps R in 4 with E in 3: we had the structure [1] [2] E R [5]

Words: ""UMPER"" not word.

""UMBER"" U-M-B-E-R -> but E in 4.

""AMBER"" A absent.

""EMBER"" E-M-B-E-R -> E in 1 and 4, not 3.

I think we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters, or try a different approach.

Let's list all possible positions for the known letters.

R: positions 3,4,5
E: positions 1,2,3
S: positions 1,2,4,5

We need to assign positions that are compatible.

For example:
- If E is in 1, then S can be in 2,4,5 and R in 3,4,5.
- If E is in 2, then S in 1,4,5 and R in 3,4,5.
- If E is in 3, then S in 1,2,4,5 and R in 4,5 (since R cannot be in 3 if E is there).

Also, the positions must be distinct.

Now, let's try to find words that fit.

Start with E in position 1: E _ _ _ _
  - S could be in 2: E S _ _ _
    - R in 3: E S R _ _ -> ""ESPRY"", ""ESKER"", ""ESTER"" (but T absent) T is absent, so ""ESTER"" invalid. ""ESKER"" is valid.
  - S in 4: E _ _ S _
    - R in 3: E _ R S _ -> ""EERSS"" not word or ""EORLS"" not.
    - R in 5: E _ _ S R -> ""EAUSR"" not or ""EMMES"" not.
  - S in 5: E _ _ _ S
    - R in 3: E _ R _ S -> ""EARLS"" A absent, ""EERKS"" not, ""EORDS"" not.
    - R in 4: E _ _ R S -> ""EURES"" not common, ""EILRS"" I absent.

So only ""ESKER"" seems possible for E in 1 and S in 2 and R in 3.

But ""ESKER"" has K, which is new.

Now, E in position 2: _ E _ _ _
  - S in 1: S E _ _ _
    - R in 3: S E R _ _ -> ""SERGE"", ""SERFS"", ""SEROW"", ""SERED"" (D)
    - R in 4: S E _ R _ -> ""SEDER"" (D, but E repeated) or ""SEGAR"" (G, but A absent) or ""SEWAR"" not common.
    - R in 5: S E _ _ R -> ""SEWER"" (W, E repeated), ""SEGGR"" not.
  - S in 4: _ E _ S _
    - R in 3: _ E R S _ -> ""VERSO"" (V,O), ""PERPS"" not, ""HERSE"" (H,E repeated)
    - R in 5: _ E _ S R -> ""MESYR"" not or ""FESOR"" not.
  - S in 5: _ E _ _ S
    - R in 3: _ E R _ S -> ""HEROS"" (H,O), ""DERMS"" (D,M), ""FERNS"" (F,N absent) invalid, ""PERPS"" not.
    - R in 4: _ E _ R S -> ""AEROS"" A absent, ""EERKS"" not, ""LORES"" L,O -> ""LORES"" is L-O-R-E-S, which is L(1),O(2),R(3),E(4),S(5) -> but we have E in position 4, not 2. We need E in position 2.

For ""HEROS"": it is H-E-R-O-S, so H(1), E(2), R(3), O(4), S(5). This fits: E in 2, R in 3, S in 5. And O in 4 and H in 1 are new.

And it avoids absent letters: C,A,T,I,N are absent, and H,O are not in that list.

Similarly, ""DERMS"" is D-E-R-M-S, which is also valid, but M is less common than O.

""HEROS"" is a good choice.

Now, E in position 3: _ _ E _ _
  - S in 1: S _ E _ _
    - R in 4: S _ E R _ -> ""SUPER"" U,P but E in 4? No, we need E in 3. ""SUPER"" is S-U-P-E-R, E in 4.
      We need a word like S ? E R ? with E in 3 and R in 4.
      ""SAYER"" A absent.
      ""SOBER"" O,B -> S-O-B-E-R, but E in 4.
      I can't find one.
    - R in 5: S _ E _ R -> ""SKEER"" not, ""SPEER"" not, ""SUPER"" E in 4.
  - S in 2: _ S E _ _
    - R in 4: _ S E R _ -> ""ASPER"" A absent, ""USHER"" U,H -> U-S-H-E-R, E in 4.
      ""RS."" not.
    - R in 5: _ S E _ R -> ""OSIER"" O,I absent (I is absent), ""USHER"" E in 4.
  - S in 4: _ _ E S _
    - R in 5: _ _ E S R -> ""MESER"" not, ""YESER"" not.
  - S in 5: _ _ E _ S
    - R in 4: _ _ E R S -> ""BERSK"" not, ""VERSO"" V,O -> V-E-R-S-O, which is V(1),E(2),R(3),S(4),O(5) -> but we have E in position 2, not 3. We need E in 3.

So for E in position 3, it's hard to find a common word.

Therefore, the best options are ""ESKER"" or ""HEROS"".

""HEROS"" seems more common than ""ESKER"".

Also, ""HEROS"" tests H and O, which are common.

So I'll go with ""HEROS"".

In ""HEROS"":
- H is new
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (allowed, since R can be in 3,4,5 and not 1 or 2)
- O in position 4
- S in position 5 (allowed, since S not in 3)

And it meets all constraints.

So the guess is ""HEROS"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Absent letters (x)**: C, A, T, I, N (eliminated from consideration).
- **Present letters (-)**: R, E, S (must be included, but in different positions).
- **Position constraints**:
  - R: Not in position 1 (from ""risen"") or 2 (from ""crate""), so must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
  - E: Not in position 4 (from ""risen"") or 5 (from ""crate""), so must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
  - S: Not in position 3 (from ""risen""), so must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

For the next guess:
- The word must include R, E, and S.
- It must exclude C, A, T, I, N.
- To maximize information, the guess should test new common letters (e.g., H, O) and adhere to the position constraints for R, E, and S.

The word **""HEROS""** is chosen because:
- It includes R (position 3), E (position 2), and S (position 5), all in allowed positions.
- It tests new common letters: H (position 1) and O (position 4).
- It avoids all absent letters.
- It is a valid English word (plural of ""hero"").

This guess will help confirm the positions of R, E, and S while providing information on H and O.",Guess 3: heros -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(-) R(-) O(x) S(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,SPERM,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Alright, the user is asking me to make my first guess in what seems like a word-guessing game similar to Wordle. Since it's the first turn and I have zero information, I need a strategic starting word. 

Hmm... optimal first guesses usually prioritize common letters and vowel-consonant balance to maximize information gain. Words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" come to mind—they're popular among enthusiasts because they cover frequent letters and include vowels. 

But wait, should I pick something that includes ""S""? Many plurals end with S, but since the word is exactly 5 letters, ending with S might be less likely. Alternatively, ""ADIEU"" focuses on vowels but leaves out common consonants. 

After some thought, ""CRATE"" feels balanced: it has two vowels (A,E) and three consonants (C,R,T) which all appear frequently in English. The letters C, R, A, T, and E give good coverage across different positions. Plus, none are overly rare—like Q or Z. 

This choice should likely reveal several hits or misses, especially since E and T are among the most common letters. If I get feedback showing correct positions or existing letters elsewhere, future guesses will narrow down faster. 

I'll commit to ""CRATE"" for now—it's methodical enough to set up the next move efficiently.I'm starting with ""CRATE"" because it's a balanced word containing common letters: 
- **C**, **R**, **T** are frequent consonants  
- **A** and **E** are the most common vowels  
This maximizes the chance of revealing correct letters/positions early.

<guess>crate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crate"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C, A, T are not in the secret word at all.
- The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position.
- The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

Therefore, the secret word must contain R and E, and does not contain C, A, or T.

We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, A, T (since they are absent)
- Must include R and E (since they are present, but in different positions)
- We also know that R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5.

We can use this information to form our next guess.

Let's think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, T.

Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

Possible letters to consider: We have 26 letters, minus C, A, T, so 23 left. But we also know the word has R and E.

We should try to cover more common letters to get more information.

Common consonants besides R: S, L, N, etc. Common vowels: E (we already have), and then O, I, U.

We also know that R is in the word but not in position 2. So R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: the word is 5 letters.

Similarly, E is in the word but not in position 5, so E could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We should avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5 in our next guess.

Let's try to think of words that have R and E, and also include other common letters we haven't tried yet, such as S, L, N, O, I, etc.

Some candidate words:

- ""robes"": but has S? Let's check: R in position 1 (which is allowed, since we don't know if R is in 1 or not), O, B, E, S. But we don't know about B and S. Also, E is in position 4 (not 5, so that's allowed). However, we don't know if O, B, S are in the word.

But note: we have to avoid A, C, T. ""robes"" doesn't have A, C, T. So it's a candidate.

But we might want to use a word that has more common letters to maximize information.

Another candidate: ""risen"" - R in position 1, I, S, E, N. E is in position 4. This avoids A, C, T.

But we know that in the first guess, R was in position 2 and was marked as wrong position. Now we are putting R in position 1. It might be that R is actually in position 1? Or it might be in 3,4,5. We don't know.

Alternatively, we could try to put R in a different position to test.

But note: we have two letters we know: R and E. We should try to place them in positions we haven't ruled out.

We also have three other positions to guess. We should try to use new common letters.

Another idea: ""reign"" - R in 1, E in 2, I, G, N. But E is in position 2? We don't know if E can be in position 2. The feedback only said E is not in position 5, so position 2 is allowed. Similarly, R in position 1 is allowed.

But we have to remember that R was originally in position 2 and was wrong. Now we are moving R to position 1. If the secret word has R in position 1, then we would get a check. If not, then we know R is in 3,4, or 5.

Similarly, E was in position 5 and was wrong, now we put it in position 2. If it's correct, we get a check; if not, then we know it's in 3 or 4.

But we also want to test other letters.

Another candidate: ""liner"" - L, I, N, E, R. But note: E is in position 4 and R in position 5. This avoids A, C, T. Also, we haven't tried L, I, N.

But we have to be cautious: if we put R in position 5, that might be a new position. Similarly, E in position 4.

However, we know that E cannot be in position 5, but position 4 is allowed. And R cannot be in position 2, but position 5 is allowed.

But note: the word ""liner"" has R at the end. That might be a good test.

But let me think of more words.

Another common word: ""rouse"" - R in 1, O, U, S, E. E in position 5? Wait, we cannot put E in position 5 because we know E is not in position 5. So ""rouse"" has E in position 5 -> invalid because we know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5, so we can have E in other positions. But if we put E in position 5, we know it will be marked as wrong position (if the word has E) or absent? But we know E is present, so if we put it in position 5, it will be marked as '-' (wrong position) because we know it's not in position 5. But that doesn't give new information. So it's better to put E in a position that we haven't tried and that is allowed (1,2,3,4).

Similarly for R: avoid position 2.

So ""rouse"" is not ideal because E is in position 5.

We can try ""rodes"" or ""rides"", but we don't know about D or S.

Another idea: ""resin"" - R in 1, E in 2, S, I, N. This has E in position 2 and R in position 1. It avoids A, C, T.

But we might also consider ""rinse"" - R in 1, I, N, S, E. E in position 5? Again, we know E is not in position 5, so we avoid that.

So ""rinse"" is not good because of E at the end.

Similarly, ""risen"" has E in position 4: R(1), I(2), S(3), E(4), N(5). That seems okay.

But in ""risen"", R is in position 1 and E in position 4.

We also have the letter I, S, N to test.

Alternatively, we can try a word that puts R in a different position, say position 3 or 4.

For example, ""beryl"" - B, E, R, Y, L. But we don't know about B, Y, L. And E is in position 2, R in position 3.

This avoids A, C, T.

But ""beryl"" is a less common word? We should stick to common words.

Another common word: ""peril"" - P, E, R, I, L. E in position 2, R in position 3. Avoids A, C, T.

But we haven't tested P, I, L.

We could also try ""urged"" - U, R, G, E, D. But U and G and D are less common? And E is in position 4, R in position 2? Wait, we cannot put R in position 2 because we know R is not in position 2. So ""urged"" has R in position 2 -> that would be invalid because we know R is not in position 2. So we must avoid putting R in position 2.

Similarly, we must avoid E in position 5.

So in our next guess, R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.

Let me list some words that have R and E, and avoid A, C, T, and with R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.

Possible words:

- ""robed"": R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), D(5) -> but E is in position 4? Wait, position 4 is allowed. But we have D at the end? And we don't know about O, B, D.

- ""robes"": as I thought earlier: R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), S(5). E is in position 4, which is allowed. R in position 1, which is allowed. We test O, B, S.

- ""ropes"": R(1), O(2), P(3), E(4), S(5). Similar.

- ""rides"": R(1), I(2), D(3), E(4), S(5). But R is in position 1, E in position 4. We test I, D, S.

- ""riles"": R(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). Same.

But note: in all these, we are putting R in position 1. What if R is not in position 1? Then we will get a '-' for R, and we know it must be in 3,4, or 5.

Alternatively, we can put R in position 3 or 4 to test other possibilities.

For example, ""wired"": W(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). But E is in position 4, which is allowed. R is in position 3, which is allowed. We test W, I, D.

But W is not very common.

""fired"": F(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). Same.

""hired"": H(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), D(5).

But we might get more information if we use more common letters.

Another idea: since we have two letters to place (R and E) and three new letters, we should choose common letters for the other positions.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, L, N, O, I, D, etc.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and must be valid.

I think ""risen"" is a good candidate: R in 1, I in 2, S in 3, E in 4, N in 5. This tests R in position 1, E in position 4, and also tests I, S, N.

But note: we know that E is not in position 5, but in ""risen"", E is in position 4, which is fine. And R is in position 1, which is not the second position (which we know is wrong for R).

Alternatively, ""robin"" but ""robin"" doesn't have E? We know the word must have E, so we must include E.

So we must have both R and E.

Another word: ""reign"" - R(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5). This has E in position 2, which is allowed. And R in position 1. We test I, G, N.

But we don't know if E can be in position 2. It might be, or it might not.

Similarly, we can try ""reins"" - R(1), E(2), I(3), N(4), S(5). But E is in position 2 and we have S at the end. But note: we know E is not in position 5, but in this word, E is in position 2, so that's allowed.

But in ""reins"", we have E in position 2. If the secret word has E in position 2, we get a check. If not, we get a '-'.

But we also have R in position 1.

I think either ""risen"" or ""reign"" or ""ropes"" are fine.

But let me consider the feedback we got: in the first guess, R was in position 2 and was marked as wrong position. That means R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 1, and if it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R must be in position 3,4, or 5.

Similarly for E: it was in position 5 and was wrong, so if we put E in position 4 (like in ""risen"") and it is correct, we get a check; if not, we get a '-' and then we know E must be in position 1,2, or 3.

So to maximize information, we might want to test R in a new position and E in a new position.

But we have limited tries.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has R and E and also includes other common letters that we haven't eliminated.

I think ""ropes"" is a good choice: R in 1, O in 2, P in 3, E in 4, S in 5. We test O, P, S, and also the positions for R and E.

But note: we know that the secret word does not have A, C, T, so we are safe.

Another common word: ""lives"" but that has V and S, and no R? We must include R and E.

""liver"" - L, I, V, E, R. This has E in position 4 and R in position 5. So E is in position 4 (allowed) and R in position 5 (allowed, since we only know it's not in position 2). We test L, I, V.

But V is less common.

I think ""ropes"" is better.

But let me check if ""ropes"" is valid: yes.

We could also use ""roses"", but that has S twice? And we don't know about S. But ""roses"" has R in 1, O in 2, S in 3, E in 4, S in 5. But we have two S's. It might be okay, but we don't know if the word has S.

But we are trying to test multiple letters.

To avoid duplication, ""ropes"" has unique letters: R, O, P, E, S. That's good.

Similarly, ""risen"" has R, I, S, E, N.

I think I'll go with ""risen"" because it includes I, S, N which are common.

But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was absent, so we avoid A. But we haven't tested I, S, N.

So ""risen"" seems good.

But let me see: we have R in position 1 (which might be correct or not), and E in position 4.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Another word: ""renew"" but that has W and two E's? Not ideal.

I think ""risen"" is a solid choice.

But wait, we know that the secret word has R and E, and we are putting R in 1 and E in 4. If the secret word has R in 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus. Similarly for E.

Also, we test I in position 2, S in position 3, N in position 5.

We know that position 2 was R in the first guess and was wrong, but now we are putting I there. It might be correct or not.

So I'll go with ""risen"".

But let me confirm: the word ""risen"" is valid.

So my next guess is ""risen"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":
- C, A, T are **absent** from the secret word.
- R is **present** but not in position 2.
- E is **present** but not in position 5.

For the second guess:
- The word must include **R** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).
- It must **exclude** C, A, T (since they are absent).
- R cannot be placed in position 2 (as per feedback).
- E cannot be placed in position 5 (as per feedback).
- To maximize information, the guess should test new common letters (e.g., S, I, N) and place R and E in positions not yet ruled out (e.g., R in position 1 or 3–5; E in positions 1–4).

The word **""risen""** is chosen because:
- It includes R (position 1) and E (position 4), both in allowed positions.
- It tests new common letters: I (position 2), S (position 3), and N (position 5).
- It avoids C, A, T.
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R and E while providing information on I, S, and N.

<guess>risen</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: risen -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) S(-) E(-) N(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crate""
- C: absent (x)
- R: present, but not in position 2 (-)
- A: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)
- E: present, but not in position 5 (-)

Guess 2: ""risen""
- R: present, but not in position 1 (-) [since it was in position 1 and marked as wrong position]
- I: absent (x)
- S: present, but not in position 3 (-)
- E: present, but not in position 4 (-) [now we know E is not in position 4 or 5]
- N: absent (x)

From this, we can deduce:

1. **Confirmed absent letters:** C, A, T, I, N
2. **Confirmed present letters:** R, E, S (since they were marked present in at least one guess)
3. **Position constraints:**
   - R: Not in position 2 (from guess 1) and not in position 1 (from guess 2). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
   - E: Not in position 5 (from guess 1) and not in position 4 (from guess 2). So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
   - S: Not in position 3 (from guess 2). So S must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Additionally, we know the secret word must contain R, E, and S, and it has exactly 5 letters.

We have used 2 guesses and have 4 remaining.

We need to choose a new word that:
- Includes R, E, S (since they are present)
- Excludes C, A, T, I, N (absent)
- Places R in one of positions 3,4,5
- Places E in one of positions 1,2,3
- Places S in one of positions 1,2,4,5 (avoiding position 3)
- Uses new letters to test for other possible present letters (since we only have 3 confirmed, and the word has 5 letters, so there are 2 more letters to discover)

Common letters not yet tested: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should aim to cover common letters to maximize information.

Let's think of words that fit the constraints.

Possible structure:

- E must be in 1,2,3
- R must be in 3,4,5
- S must be in 1,2,4,5

We also need to avoid positions that are ruled out for each.

One idea: Place E in position 1, then R in position 3 or 4 or 5, and S in position 2,4,5 (but not conflicting).

For example:
- Position 1: E (if we try E in position 1)
- Position 2: S? But S can be in 2, and E in 1 is allowed.
- Then R in 3,4, or 5.

But we need two more letters.

Alternatively, place E in position 2, then R in 3,4,5 and S in 1,4,5.

Let's list possible words:

Try E in position 1:
- E _ _ _ _
  - Then we can have S in position 2: E S _ _ _
    - Then R in 3,4,5: e.g., E S R _ _ (but R in 3) -> but we need two more letters, and avoid absent letters.
    - Words: ""ESPRY"" (but Y is less common, and we don't know if P is present) or ""ESKER"" (but K and E again? and we have E already, but it's allowed if the word has two E's? But we don't know if E is repeated. However, in feedback, E was only marked present once, but it could be repeated? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates. So we have to consider that possibility. But to be safe, let's avoid assuming duplicates for now.

But we need to use common words.

Another idea: Place E in position 3, then R in 3? But E and R both in position 3? No, only one letter per position.

E in position 3 and R in position 4 or 5? That could work.

For example: _ _ E R _ 

But S must be in 1,2,4,5. If we put R in 4, then S cannot be in 4, so S in 1,2,5.

Similarly, if E is in 3, then we have positions 1,2 for other letters and 5 for S or R.

Let me try to form words.

We know the word must have R, E, S and two more letters (not C,A,T,I,N).

Common letters: O, L, D, U, etc.

Try a word with E in position 2? That might be promising.

For example: _ E _ _ _

Then R in 3,4,5 and S in 1,4,5.

If we put S in position 1: S E _ _ _

Then R in 3,4,5: e.g., S E R _ _ (R in 3) -> ""SERUM"" (but U and M, and we don't know) or ""SERIF"" (F) or ""SEROW"" (O and W).

But we have to avoid I (absent) so ""SERIF"" has I? No, I is absent, so we cannot use I. ""SERIF"" has I? S-E-R-I-F -> I is the fourth letter, but we know I is absent, so invalid.

Similarly, ""SERUM"" has U and M, which are not tested.

Another possibility: S in position 1, E in position 2, and R in position 5: S E _ _ R

Then the word must have another letter in position 3 and 4, and we have S, E, and R already, but the word must have 5 distinct? Not necessarily, but we don't know.

Words: ""SEWER"" (but E is repeated, and W) or ""SEPIA"" (but A is absent) or ""SEDGE"" (E repeated, D, G).

But we avoid A, so ""SEPIA"" is out.

""SEWER"" has E twice, which is possible.

But let's see if we can avoid duplicates for now.

Place E in position 3.

So: _ _ E _ _

Then R in 3,4,5 -> but position 3 is taken by E, so R in 4 or 5.

S in 1,2,4,5.

Case 1: R in 4: _ _ E R _
  - Then S in 1,2,5: 
    - If S in 1: S _ E R _
    - If S in 2: _ S E R _
    - If S in 5: _ _ E R S

Case 2: R in 5: _ _ E _ R
  - Then S in 1,2,4: 
    - S in 1: S _ E _ R
    - S in 2: _ S E _ R
    - S in 4: _ _ E S R

Now, we need to fill the remaining positions with letters not in {C,A,T,I,N} and common.

Let's try to form words:

For S in 1 and R in 4: S _ E R _
  - Words: ""SOWER"" (O, W, E) -> but E is in position 3, and we have E already? The word has E at 3 and R at 4. ""SOWER"" is S-O-W-E-R -> positions: S(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5) -> but we have E in position 4? But we placed E in position 3, so this doesn't match.

We have fixed E in position 3, so for case 1 (R in 4): the word is _ _ E R _ , so positions: 1,2, E, R, 5.

So for S in 1: S _ E R _ -> we need a letter for position 2 and 5.

Words: ""SUER?"" but not 5 letters. ""SOLER"" (O, L) -> S-O-L-E-R? But that's S(1),O(2),L(3),E(4),R(5) -> but we have E in position 4, but we wanted E in position 3? I think I confused.

If we set E in position 3 and R in position 4, then the word is: [1] [2] E R [5]

So for example, if S is in position 1: S [2] E R [5]

We need letters for position 2 and 5, not C,A,T,I,N.

Possible words: 
- ""SUERS"" (but S repeated and not common) 
- ""SAYER"" (but A is absent) 
- ""SOBER"" (O, B) -> S-O-B-E-R -> S(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), R(5) -> but we have E in position 4, but we set E to be in position 3? This has E in 4, not 3.

I think I made a mistake: if E is in position 3, then position 3 is E. Then R in position 4, so position 4 is R. Then position 1,2,5 to fill.

So the word is: [1] [2] E R [5]

We cannot have a letter in position 3 because it's E, and position 4 is R.

So the word has five positions: 1,2,3=E,4=R,5.

So for example, ""POWER"" is P-O-W-E-R, which is P(1),O(2),W(3),E(4),R(5) -> but that has E in 4, not 3.

We need a word with E in position 3 and R in position 4.

For example: ""LOWER"" is L-O-W-E-R -> E in 4, not 3.

""BOXER"" is B-O-X-E-R -> same.

""DEFER"" is D-E-F-E-R -> E in 2 and 4.

We need a word with the third letter E and fourth letter R.

Examples: ""RULER"" is R-U-L-E-R -> E in 4.

""TIGER"" is T-I-G-E-R -> E in 4.

I'm struggling. Let me think: ""ORDER"" is O-R-D-E-R -> E in 4.

""OFFER"" is O-F-F-E-R -> E in 4.

What about ""OAKER""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""EYERS"" or something, but not common.

Another idea: ""LEVER"" is L-E-V-E-R -> E in 2 and 4.

We need a word with E in position 3.

For example: ""AXLED"" but not common.

Perhaps I should consider other placements.

Let's try E in position 1.

So: E _ _ _ _

Then R in 3,4,5.

S in 2,4,5 (since not 3).

If S in 2: E S _ _ _

Then R in 3,4,5.

If R in 3: E S R _ _ -> ""ESPRY"" (not common) or ""ESTRO"" (not word) or ""ESKER"" (which is a word, meaning a glacial ridge).

""ESKER"" has E(1), S(2), K(3), E(4), R(5) -> but E is repeated, and we have E in position 1 and 4. But we know E is present, and it could be repeated. Also, K is new.

But let's see feedback: in guess 1, E was present but not in 5, and in guess 2, E was present but not in 4. So if the word has two E's, it's possible.

But we can try.

Another word: E in 1, S in 5, and R in 3: E _ R _ S

Words: ""EARLS"" (but A is absent) or ""EERKS"" not word.

""EURES"" not common.

Place E in position 2.

So: _ E _ _ _

Then R in 3,4,5.

S in 1,4,5.

If S in 1: S E _ _ _

Then R in 3,4,5.

If R in 3: S E R _ _ -> ""SERGE"" (G) or ""SERFS"" (F) or ""SEROW"" (O,W)

If R in 4: S E _ R _ -> ""SEORA"" (A absent) or ""SEPIA"" (A absent) or ""SEDGY"" (D,G,Y) or ""SEDGE"" (D,G,E repeated)

If R in 5: S E _ _ R -> ""SEWER"" (W,E repeated) or ""SEIZR"" not word.

Now, with S in 1, E in 2, R in 5: ""SEWER"" is a word, but has E repeated.

But let's avoid duplicates if possible.

Another option: S in 4 or 5.

For example, with E in 2, and S in 4: _ E _ S _

Then R in 3,4,5 -> but S is in 4, so R cannot be in 4, so R in 3 or 5.

If R in 3: _ E R S _ -> ""BERSK"" not word or ""VERSO"" (V,O) or ""PERSU"" not common.

If R in 5: _ E _ S R -> ""MESER"" not common or ""YESES"" S repeated.

With E in 2, S in 5: _ E _ _ S

Then R in 3,4,5 -> but S is in 5, so R in 3 or 4.

If R in 3: _ E R _ S -> ""HEROS"" (H,O) or ""ZEROS"" (Z,O) or ""FERNS"" (F, but N absent) N is absent, so ""FERNS"" has N, which is absent, invalid.

""HEROS"" is H-E-R-O-S, which is valid, and H, O are new.

Similarly, ""DEROS"" not common.

So ""HEROS"" is a possibility.

But we have to check if it meets: E in position 2, R in position 3, S in position 5. And H in 1, O in 4.

Letters: H, E, R, O, S. All not in absent list.

Similarly, another word: ""ZEROS"" but Z is less common.

Or ""MERES"" but E repeated and S at the end, but ""MERES"" is M-E-R-E-S, so E in 2 and 4, R in 3, S in 5.

But E repeated.

To avoid duplication, ""HEROS"" is better.

But ""HEROS"" is a valid word (plural of hero).

Another option: E in position 3.

Let's find a word with E in position 3 and R in position 5, for example.

So: _ _ E _ R

Then S in 1,2,4.

If S in 1: S _ E _ R -> ""SKEER"" not common or ""SPEER"" not or ""SUPER"" (U,P) -> S-U-P-E-R, which is S(1),U(2),P(3),E(4),R(5) -> but we have E in position 4, not 3.

We need E in position 3.

So for ""SUPER"", E is in 4.

What word has E in position 3 and R in position 5? ""LATER"" is L-A-T-E-R, but A and T absent.

""PIPER"" is P-I-P-E-R, I absent.

""BOXER"" B-O-X-E-R, E in 4.

""MAKER"" M-A-K-E-R, A absent.

""USER"" U-S-E-R, but 4 letters.

""BASER"" B-A-S-E-R, A absent.

It's hard. ""OAKER"" not word.

Perhaps ""OGEED"" not word.

Another idea: ""EYRES"" E-Y-R-E-S, but E in 1 and 4.

I think it's difficult to find with E in 3 and R in 5.

Perhaps R in 4 with E in 3: we had the structure [1] [2] E R [5]

Words: ""UMPER"" not word.

""UMBER"" U-M-B-E-R -> but E in 4.

""AMBER"" A absent.

""EMBER"" E-M-B-E-R -> E in 1 and 4, not 3.

I think we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters, or try a different approach.

Let's list all possible positions for the known letters.

R: positions 3,4,5
E: positions 1,2,3
S: positions 1,2,4,5

We need to assign positions that are compatible.

For example:
- If E is in 1, then S can be in 2,4,5 and R in 3,4,5.
- If E is in 2, then S in 1,4,5 and R in 3,4,5.
- If E is in 3, then S in 1,2,4,5 and R in 4,5 (since R cannot be in 3 if E is there).

Also, the positions must be distinct.

Now, let's try to find words that fit.

Start with E in position 1: E _ _ _ _
  - S could be in 2: E S _ _ _
    - R in 3: E S R _ _ -> ""ESPRY"", ""ESKER"", ""ESTER"" (but T absent) T is absent, so ""ESTER"" invalid. ""ESKER"" is valid.
  - S in 4: E _ _ S _
    - R in 3: E _ R S _ -> ""EERSS"" not word or ""EORLS"" not.
    - R in 5: E _ _ S R -> ""EAUSR"" not or ""EMMES"" not.
  - S in 5: E _ _ _ S
    - R in 3: E _ R _ S -> ""EARLS"" A absent, ""EERKS"" not, ""EORDS"" not.
    - R in 4: E _ _ R S -> ""EURES"" not common, ""EILRS"" I absent.

So only ""ESKER"" seems possible for E in 1 and S in 2 and R in 3.

But ""ESKER"" has K, which is new.

Now, E in position 2: _ E _ _ _
  - S in 1: S E _ _ _
    - R in 3: S E R _ _ -> ""SERGE"", ""SERFS"", ""SEROW"", ""SERED"" (D)
    - R in 4: S E _ R _ -> ""SEDER"" (D, but E repeated) or ""SEGAR"" (G, but A absent) or ""SEWAR"" not common.
    - R in 5: S E _ _ R -> ""SEWER"" (W, E repeated), ""SEGGR"" not.
  - S in 4: _ E _ S _
    - R in 3: _ E R S _ -> ""VERSO"" (V,O), ""PERPS"" not, ""HERSE"" (H,E repeated)
    - R in 5: _ E _ S R -> ""MESYR"" not or ""FESOR"" not.
  - S in 5: _ E _ _ S
    - R in 3: _ E R _ S -> ""HEROS"" (H,O), ""DERMS"" (D,M), ""FERNS"" (F,N absent) invalid, ""PERPS"" not.
    - R in 4: _ E _ R S -> ""AEROS"" A absent, ""EERKS"" not, ""LORES"" L,O -> ""LORES"" is L-O-R-E-S, which is L(1),O(2),R(3),E(4),S(5) -> but we have E in position 4, not 2. We need E in position 2.

For ""HEROS"": it is H-E-R-O-S, so H(1), E(2), R(3), O(4), S(5). This fits: E in 2, R in 3, S in 5. And O in 4 and H in 1 are new.

And it avoids absent letters: C,A,T,I,N are absent, and H,O are not in that list.

Similarly, ""DERMS"" is D-E-R-M-S, which is also valid, but M is less common than O.

""HEROS"" is a good choice.

Now, E in position 3: _ _ E _ _
  - S in 1: S _ E _ _
    - R in 4: S _ E R _ -> ""SUPER"" U,P but E in 4? No, we need E in 3. ""SUPER"" is S-U-P-E-R, E in 4.
      We need a word like S ? E R ? with E in 3 and R in 4.
      ""SAYER"" A absent.
      ""SOBER"" O,B -> S-O-B-E-R, but E in 4.
      I can't find one.
    - R in 5: S _ E _ R -> ""SKEER"" not, ""SPEER"" not, ""SUPER"" E in 4.
  - S in 2: _ S E _ _
    - R in 4: _ S E R _ -> ""ASPER"" A absent, ""USHER"" U,H -> U-S-H-E-R, E in 4.
      ""RS."" not.
    - R in 5: _ S E _ R -> ""OSIER"" O,I absent (I is absent), ""USHER"" E in 4.
  - S in 4: _ _ E S _
    - R in 5: _ _ E S R -> ""MESER"" not, ""YESER"" not.
  - S in 5: _ _ E _ S
    - R in 4: _ _ E R S -> ""BERSK"" not, ""VERSO"" V,O -> V-E-R-S-O, which is V(1),E(2),R(3),S(4),O(5) -> but we have E in position 2, not 3. We need E in 3.

So for E in position 3, it's hard to find a common word.

Therefore, the best options are ""ESKER"" or ""HEROS"".

""HEROS"" seems more common than ""ESKER"".

Also, ""HEROS"" tests H and O, which are common.

So I'll go with ""HEROS"".

In ""HEROS"":
- H is new
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (allowed, since R can be in 3,4,5 and not 1 or 2)
- O in position 4
- S in position 5 (allowed, since S not in 3)

And it meets all constraints.

So the guess is ""HEROS"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Absent letters (x)**: C, A, T, I, N (eliminated from consideration).
- **Present letters (-)**: R, E, S (must be included, but in different positions).
- **Position constraints**:
  - R: Not in position 1 (from ""risen"") or 2 (from ""crate""), so must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
  - E: Not in position 4 (from ""risen"") or 5 (from ""crate""), so must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
  - S: Not in position 3 (from ""risen""), so must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

For the next guess:
- The word must include R, E, and S.
- It must exclude C, A, T, I, N.
- To maximize information, the guess should test new common letters (e.g., H, O) and adhere to the position constraints for R, E, and S.

The word **""HEROS""** is chosen because:
- It includes R (position 3), E (position 2), and S (position 5), all in allowed positions.
- It tests new common letters: H (position 1) and O (position 4).
- It avoids all absent letters.
- It is a valid English word (plural of ""hero"").

This guess will help confirm the positions of R, E, and S while providing information on H and O.

Words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" come to mind—they\'re popular among enthusiasts because they cover frequent letters and include vowels. \n\nBut wait, should I pick something that includes ""S""?

So R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: the word is 5 letters.\n\nSimilarly, E is in the word but not in position 5, so E could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWe should avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5 in our next guess.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that have R and E, and also include other common letters we haven\'t tried yet, such as S, L, N, O, I, etc.\n\nSome candidate words:\n\n- ""robes"": but has S? Let\'s check: R in position 1 (which is allowed, since we don\'t know if R is in 1 or not), O, B, E, S. But we don\'t know about B and S. Also, E is in position 4 (not 5, so that\'s allowed). However, we don\'t know if O, B, S are in the word.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid A, C, T. ""robes"" doesn\'t have A, C, T. So it\'s a candidate.\n\nBut we might want to use a word that has more common letters to maximize information.\n\nAnother candidate: ""risen"" - R in position 1, I, S, E, N. E is in position 4. This avoids A, C, T.\n\nBut we know that in the first guess, R was in position 2 and was marked as wrong position. Now we are putting R in position 1. It might be that R is actually in position 1? Or it might be in 3,4,5. We don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to put R in a different position to test.\n\nBut note: we have two letters we know: R and E. We should try to place them in positions we haven\'t ruled out.\n\nWe also have three other positions to guess. We should try to use new common letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""reign"" - R in 1, E in 2, I, G, N. But E is in position 2? We don\'t know if E can be in position 2. The feedback only said E is not in position 5, so position 2 is allowed. Similarly, R in position 1 is allowed.\n\nBut we have to remember that R was originally in position 2 and was wrong. Now we are moving R to position 1. If the secret word has R in position 1, then we would get a check. If not, then we know R is in 3,4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, E was in position 5 and was wrong, now we put it in position 2. If it\'s correct, we get a check; if not, then we know it\'s in 3 or 4.\n\nBut we also want to test other letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""liner"" - L, I, N, E, R. But note: E is in position 4 and R in position 5. This avoids A, C, T. Also, we haven\'t tried L, I, N.\n\nBut we have to be cautious: if we put R in position 5, that might be a new position. Similarly, E in position 4.\n\nHowever, we know that E cannot be in position 5, but position 4 is allowed. And R cannot be in position 2, but position 5 is allowed.\n\nBut note: the word ""liner"" has R at the end. That might be a good test.\n\nBut let me think of more words.\n\nAnother common word: ""rouse"" - R in 1, O, U, S, E. E in position 5? Wait, we cannot put E in position 5 because we know E is not in position 5. So ""rouse"" has E in position 5 -> invalid because we know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5, so we can have E in other positions. But if we put E in position 5, we know it will be marked as wrong position (if the word has E) or absent? But we know E is present, so if we put it in position 5, it will be marked as \'-\' (wrong position) because we know it\'s not in position 5. But that doesn\'t give new information. So it\'s better to put E in a position that we haven\'t tried and that is allowed (1,2,3,4).\n\nSimilarly for R: avoid position 2.\n\nSo ""rouse"" is not ideal because E is in position 5.\n\nWe can try ""rodes"" or ""rides"", but we don\'t know about D or S.\n\nAnother idea: ""resin"" - R in 1, E in 2, S, I, N. This has E in position 2 and R in position 1. It avoids A, C, T.\n\nBut we might also consider ""rinse"" - R in 1, I, N, S, E. E in position 5? Again, we know E is not in position 5, so we avoid that.\n\nSo ""rinse"" is not good because of E at the end.\n\nSimilarly, ""risen"" has E in position 4: R(1), I(2), S(3), E(4), N(5). That seems okay.\n\nBut in ""risen"", R is in position 1 and E in position 4.\n\nWe also have the letter I, S, N to test.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that puts R in a different position, say position 3 or 4.\n\nFor example, ""beryl"" - B, E, R, Y, L. But we don\'t know about B, Y, L. And E is in position 2, R in position 3.\n\nThis avoids A, C, T.\n\nBut ""beryl"" is a less common word? We should stick to common words.\n\nAnother common word: ""peril"" - P, E, R, I, L. E in position 2, R in position 3. Avoids A, C, T.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested P, I, L.\n\nWe could also try ""urged"" - U, R, G, E, D. But U and G and D are less common? And E is in position 4, R in position 2? Wait, we cannot put R in position 2 because we know R is not in position 2. So ""urged"" has R in position 2 -> that would be invalid because we know R is not in position 2. So we must avoid putting R in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid E in position 5.\n\nSo in our next guess, R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.\n\nLet me list some words that have R and E, and avoid A, C, T, and with R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""robed"": R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), D(5) -> but E is in position 4? Wait, position 4 is allowed. But we have D at the end? And we don\'t know about O, B, D.\n\n- ""robes"": as I thought earlier: R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), S(5). E is in position 4, which is allowed. R in position 1, which is allowed. We test O, B, S.\n\n- ""ropes"": R(1), O(2), P(3), E(4), S(5). Similar.\n\n- ""rides"": R(1), I(2), D(3), E(4), S(5). But R is in position 1, E in position 4. We test I, D, S.\n\n- ""riles"": R(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). Same.\n\nBut note: in all these, we are putting R in position 1. What if R is not in position 1? Then we will get a \'-\' for R, and we know it must be in 3,4, or 5.\n\nAlternatively, we can put R in position 3 or 4 to test other possibilities.\n\nFor example, ""wired"": W(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). But E is in position 4, which is allowed. R is in position 3, which is allowed. We test W, I, D.\n\nBut W is not very common.\n\n""fired"": F(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). Same.\n\n""hired"": H(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), D(5).\n\nBut we might get more information if we use more common letters.\n\nAnother idea: since we have two letters to place (R and E) and three new letters, we should choose common letters for the other positions.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: S, L, N, O, I, D, etc.\n\nWe also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and must be valid.\n\nI think ""risen"" is a good candidate: R in 1, I in 2, S in 3, E in 4, N in 5. This tests R in position 1, E in position 4, and also tests I, S, N.\n\nBut note: we know that E is not in position 5, but in ""risen"", E is in position 4, which is fine. And R is in position 1, which is not the second position (which we know is wrong for R).\n\nAlternatively, ""robin"" but ""robin"" doesn\'t have E? We know the word must have E, so we must include E.\n\nSo we must have both R and E.\n\nAnother word: ""reign"" - R(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5). This has E in position 2, which is allowed. And R in position 1. We test I, G, N.\n\nBut we don\'t know if E can be in position 2. It might be, or it might not.\n\nSimilarly, we can try ""reins"" - R(1), E(2), I(3), N(4), S(5). But E is in position 2 and we have S at the end. But note: we know E is not in position 5, but in this word, E is in position 2, so that\'s allowed.\n\nBut in ""reins"", we have E in position 2. If the secret word has E in position 2, we get a check. If not, we get a \'-\'.\n\nBut we also have R in position 1.\n\nI think either ""risen"" or ""reign"" or ""ropes"" are fine.\n\nBut let me consider the feedback we got: in the first guess, R was in position 2 and was marked as wrong position. That means R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 1, and if it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know R must be in position 3,4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly for E: it was in position 5 and was wrong, so if we put E in position 4 (like in ""risen"") and it is correct, we get a check; if not, we get a \'-\' and then we know E must be in position 1,2, or 3.\n\nSo to maximize information, we might want to test R in a new position and E in a new position.\n\nBut we have limited tries.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has R and E and also includes other common letters that we haven\'t eliminated.\n\nI think ""ropes"" is a good choice: R in 1, O in 2, P in 3, E in 4, S in 5. We test O, P, S, and also the positions for R and E.\n\nBut note: we know that the secret word does not have A, C, T, so we are safe.\n\nAnother common word: ""lives"" but that has V and S, and no R? We must include R and E.\n\n""liver"" - L, I, V, E, R. This has E in position 4 and R in position 5. So E is in position 4 (allowed) and R in position 5 (allowed, since we only know it\'s not in position 2). We test L, I, V.\n\nBut V is less common.\n\nI think ""ropes"" is better.\n\nBut let me check if ""ropes"" is valid: yes.\n\nWe could also use ""roses"", but that has S twice? And we don\'t know about S. But ""roses"" has R in 1, O in 2, S in 3, E in 4, S in 5. But we have two S\'s. It might be okay, but we don\'t know if the word has S.\n\nBut we are trying to test multiple letters.\n\nTo avoid duplication, ""ropes"" has unique letters: R, O, P, E, S. That\'s good.\n\nSimilarly, ""risen"" has R, I, S, E, N.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""risen"" because it includes I, S, N which are common.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was absent, so we avoid A. But we haven\'t tested I, S, N.\n\nSo ""risen"" seems good.\n\nBut let me see: we have R in position 1 (which might be correct or not), and E in position 4.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nAnother word: ""renew"" but that has W and two E\'s? Not ideal.\n\nI think ""risen"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut wait, we know that the secret word has R and E, and we are putting R in 1 and E in 4. If the secret word has R in 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus. Similarly for E.\n\nAlso, we test I in position 2, S in position 3, N in position 5.\n\nWe know that position 2 was R in the first guess and was wrong, but now we are putting I there. It might be correct or not.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""risen"".\n\nBut let me confirm: the word ""risen"" is valid.\n\nSo my next guess is ""risen"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":\n- C, A, T are **absent** from the secret word.\n- R is **present** but not in position 2.\n- E is **present** but not in position 5.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include **R** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).\n- It must **exclude** C, A, T (since they are absent).\n- R cannot be placed in position 2 (as per feedback).\n- E cannot be placed in position 5 (as per feedback).\n- To maximize information, the guess should test new common letters (e.g., S, I, N) and place R and E in positions not yet ruled out (e.g., R in position 1 or 3–5; E in positions 1–4).\n\nThe word **""risen""** is chosen because:\n- It includes R (position 1) and E (position 4), both in allowed positions.\n- It tests new common letters: I (position 2), S (position 3), and N (position 5).\n- It avoids C, A, T.\n- It is a valid English word.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of R and E while providing information on I, S, and N.\n\n<guess>risen</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: risen -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) S(-) E(-) N(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crate""\n- C: absent (x)\n- R: present, but not in position 2 (-)\n- A: absent (x)\n- T: absent (x)\n- E: present, but not in position 5 (-)\n\nGuess 2: ""risen""\n- R: present, but not in position 1 (-) [since it was in position 1 and marked as wrong position]\n- I: absent (x)\n- S: present, but not in position 3 (-)\n- E: present, but not in position 4 (-) [now we know E is not in position 4 or 5]\n- N: absent (x)\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n\n1. **Confirmed absent letters:** C, A, T, I, N\n2. **Confirmed present letters:** R, E, S (since they were marked present in at least one guess)\n3. **Position constraints:**\n   - R: Not in position 2 (from guess 1) and not in position 1 (from guess 2). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n   - E: Not in position 5 (from guess 1) and not in position 4 (from guess 2). So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n   - S: Not in position 3 (from guess 2). So S must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nAdditionally, we know the secret word must contain R, E, and S, and it has exactly 5 letters.\n\nWe have used 2 guesses and have 4 remaining.\n\nWe need to choose a new word that:\n- Includes R, E, S (since they are present)\n- Excludes C, A, T, I, N (absent)\n- Places R in one of positions 3,4,5\n- Places E in one of positions 1,2,3\n- Places S in one of positions 1,2,4,5 (avoiding position 3)\n- Uses new letters to test for other possible present letters (since we only have 3 confirmed, and the word has 5 letters, so there are 2 more letters to discover)\n\nCommon letters not yet tested: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe should aim to cover common letters to maximize information.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit the constraints.\n\nPossible structure:\n\n- E must be in 1,2,3\n- R must be in 3,4,5\n- S must be in 1,2,4,5\n\nWe also need to avoid positions that are ruled out for each.\n\nOne idea: Place E in position 1, then R in position 3 or 4 or 5, and S in position 2,4,5 (but not conflicting).\n\nFor example:\n- Position 1: E (if we try E in position 1)\n- Position 2: S? But S can be in 2, and E in 1 is allowed.\n- Then R in 3,4, or 5.\n\nBut we need two more letters.\n\nAlternatively, place E in position 2, then R in 3,4,5 and S in 1,4,5.\n\nLet\'s list possible words:\n\nTry E in position 1:\n- E _ _ _ _\n  - Then we can have S in position 2: E S _ _ _\n    - Then R in 3,4,5: e.g., E S R _ _ (but R in 3) -> but we need two more letters, and avoid absent letters.\n    - Words: ""ESPRY"" (but Y is less common, and we don\'t know if P is present) or ""ESKER"" (but K and E again? and we have E already, but it\'s allowed if the word has two E\'s? But we don\'t know if E is repeated. However, in feedback, E was only marked present once, but it could be repeated? The feedback doesn\'t indicate duplicates. So we have to consider that possibility. But to be safe, let\'s avoid assuming duplicates for now.\n\nBut we need to use common words.\n\nAnother idea: Place E in position 3, then R in 3? But E and R both in position 3? No, only one letter per position.\n\nE in position 3 and R in position 4 or 5? That could work.\n\nFor example: _ _ E R _ \n\nBut S must be in 1,2,4,5. If we put R in 4, then S cannot be in 4, so S in 1,2,5.\n\nSimilarly, if E is in 3, then we have positions 1,2 for other letters and 5 for S or R.\n\nLet me try to form words.\n\nWe know the word must have R, E, S and two more letters (not C,A,T,I,N).\n\nCommon letters: O, L, D, U, etc.\n\nTry a word with E in position 2? That might be promising.\n\nFor example: _ E _ _ _\n\nThen R in 3,4,5 and S in 1,4,5.\n\nIf we put S in position 1: S E _ _ _\n\nThen R in 3,4,5: e.g., S E R _ _ (R in 3) -> ""SERUM"" (but U and M, and we don\'t know) or ""SERIF"" (F) or ""SEROW"" (O and W).\n\nBut we have to avoid I (absent) so ""SERIF"" has I? No, I is absent, so we cannot use I. ""SERIF"" has I? S-E-R-I-F -> I is the fourth letter, but we know I is absent, so invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""SERUM"" has U and M, which are not tested.\n\nAnother possibility: S in position 1, E in position 2, and R in position 5: S E _ _ R\n\nThen the word must have another letter in position 3 and 4, and we have S, E, and R already, but the word must have 5 distinct? Not necessarily, but we don\'t know.\n\nWords: ""SEWER"" (but E is repeated, and W) or ""SEPIA"" (but A is absent) or ""SEDGE"" (E repeated, D, G).\n\nBut we avoid A, so ""SEPIA"" is out.\n\n""SEWER"" has E twice, which is possible.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can avoid duplicates for now.\n\nPlace E in position 3.\n\nSo: _ _ E _ _\n\nThen R in 3,4,5 -> but position 3 is taken by E, so R in 4 or 5.\n\nS in 1,2,4,5.\n\nCase 1: R in 4: _ _ E R _\n  - Then S in 1,2,5: \n    - If S in 1: S _ E R _\n    - If S in 2: _ S E R _\n    - If S in 5: _ _ E R S\n\nCase 2: R in 5: _ _ E _ R\n  - Then S in 1,2,4: \n    - S in 1: S _ E _ R\n    - S in 2: _ S E _ R\n    - S in 4: _ _ E S R\n\nNow, we need to fill the remaining positions with letters not in {C,A,T,I,N} and common.\n\nLet\'s try to form words:\n\nFor S in 1 and R in 4: S _ E R _\n  - Words: ""SOWER"" (O, W, E) -> but E is in position 3, and we have E already? The word has E at 3 and R at 4. ""SOWER"" is S-O-W-E-R -> positions: S(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5) -> but we have E in position 4? But we placed E in position 3, so this doesn\'t match.\n\nWe have fixed E in position 3, so for case 1 (R in 4): the word is _ _ E R _ , so positions: 1,2, E, R, 5.\n\nSo for S in 1: S _ E R _ -> we need a letter for position 2 and 5.\n\nWords: ""SUER?"" but not 5 letters. ""SOLER"" (O, L) -> S-O-L-E-R? But that\'s S(1),O(2),L(3),E(4),R(5) -> but we have E in position 4, but we wanted E in position 3? I think I confused.\n\nIf we set E in position 3 and R in position 4, then the word is: [1] [2] E R [5]\n\nSo for example, if S is in position 1: S [2] E R [5]\n\nWe need letters for position 2 and 5, not C,A,T,I,N.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""SUERS"" (but S repeated and not common) \n- ""SAYER"" (but A is absent) \n- ""SOBER"" (O, B) -> S-O-B-E-R -> S(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), R(5) -> but we have E in position 4, but we set E to be in position 3? This has E in 4, not 3.\n\nI think I made a mistake: if E is in position 3, then position 3 is E. Then R in position 4, so position 4 is R. Then position 1,2,5 to fill.\n\nSo the word is: [1] [2] E R [5]\n\nWe cannot have a letter in position 3 because it\'s E, and position 4 is R.\n\nSo the word has five positions: 1,2,3=E,4=R,5.\n\nSo for example, ""POWER"" is P-O-W-E-R, which is P(1),O(2),W(3),E(4),R(5) -> but that has E in 4, not 3.\n\nWe need a word with E in position 3 and R in position 4.\n\nFor example: ""LOWER"" is L-O-W-E-R -> E in 4, not 3.\n\n""BOXER"" is B-O-X-E-R -> same.\n\n""DEFER"" is D-E-F-E-R -> E in 2 and 4.\n\nWe need a word with the third letter E and fourth letter R.\n\nExamples: ""RULER"" is R-U-L-E-R -> E in 4.\n\n""TIGER"" is T-I-G-E-R -> E in 4.\n\nI\'m struggling. Let me think: ""ORDER"" is O-R-D-E-R -> E in 4.\n\n""OFFER"" is O-F-F-E-R -> E in 4.\n\nWhat about ""OAKER""? Not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""EYERS"" or something, but not common.\n\nAnother idea: ""LEVER"" is L-E-V-E-R -> E in 2 and 4.\n\nWe need a word with E in position 3.\n\nFor example: ""AXLED"" but not common.\n\nPerhaps I should consider other placements.\n\nLet\'s try E in position 1.\n\nSo: E _ _ _ _\n\nThen R in 3,4,5.\n\nS in 2,4,5 (since not 3).\n\nIf S in 2: E S _ _ _\n\nThen R in 3,4,5.\n\nIf R in 3: E S R _ _ -> ""ESPRY"" (not common) or ""ESTRO"" (not word) or ""ESKER"" (which is a word, meaning a glacial ridge).\n\n""ESKER"" has E(1), S(2), K(3), E(4), R(5) -> but E is repeated, and we have E in position 1 and 4. But we know E is present, and it could be repeated. Also, K is new.\n\nBut let\'s see feedback: in guess 1, E was present but not in 5, and in guess 2, E was present but not in 4. So if the word has two E\'s, it\'s possible.\n\nBut we can try.\n\nAnother word: E in 1, S in 5, and R in 3: E _ R _ S\n\nWords: ""EARLS"" (but A is absent) or ""EERKS"" not word.\n\n""EURES"" not common.\n\nPlace E in position 2.\n\nSo: _ E _ _ _\n\nThen R in 3,4,5.\n\nS in 1,4,5.\n\nIf S in 1: S E _ _ _\n\nThen R in 3,4,5.\n\nIf R in 3: S E R _ _ -> ""SERGE"" (G) or ""SERFS"" (F) or ""SEROW"" (O,W)\n\nIf R in 4: S E _ R _ -> ""SEORA"" (A absent) or ""SEPIA"" (A absent) or ""SEDGY"" (D,G,Y) or ""SEDGE"" (D,G,E repeated)\n\nIf R in 5: S E _ _ R -> ""SEWER"" (W,E repeated) or ""SEIZR"" not word.\n\nNow, with S in 1, E in 2, R in 5: ""SEWER"" is a word, but has E repeated.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates if possible.\n\nAnother option: S in 4 or 5.\n\nFor example, with E in 2, and S in 4: _ E _ S _\n\nThen R in 3,4,5 -> but S is in 4, so R cannot be in 4, so R in 3 or 5.\n\nIf R in 3: _ E R S _ -> ""BERSK"" not word or ""VERSO"" (V,O) or ""PERSU"" not common.\n\nIf R in 5: _ E _ S R -> ""MESER"" not common or ""YESES"" S repeated.\n\nWith E in 2, S in 5: _ E _ _ S\n\nThen R in 3,4,5 -> but S is in 5, so R in 3 or 4.\n\nIf R in 3: _ E R _ S -> ""HEROS"" (H,O) or ""ZEROS"" (Z,O) or ""FERNS"" (F, but N absent) N is absent, so ""FERNS"" has N, which is absent, invalid.\n\n""HEROS"" is H-E-R-O-S, which is valid, and H, O are new.\n\nSimilarly, ""DEROS"" not common.\n\nSo ""HEROS"" is a possibility.\n\nBut we have to check if it meets: E in position 2, R in position 3, S in position 5. And H in 1, O in 4.\n\nLetters: H, E, R, O, S. All not in absent list.\n\nSimilarly, another word: ""ZEROS"" but Z is less common.\n\nOr ""MERES"" but E repeated and S at the end, but ""MERES"" is M-E-R-E-S, so E in 2 and 4, R in 3, S in 5.\n\nBut E repeated.\n\nTo avoid duplication, ""HEROS"" is better.\n\nBut ""HEROS"" is a valid word (plural of hero).\n\nAnother option: E in position 3.\n\nLet\'s find a word with E in position 3 and R in position 5, for example.\n\nSo: _ _ E _ R\n\nThen S in 1,2,4.\n\nIf S in 1: S _ E _ R -> ""SKEER"" not common or ""SPEER"" not or ""SUPER"" (U,P) -> S-U-P-E-R, which is S(1),U(2),P(3),E(4),R(5) -> but we have E in position 4, not 3.\n\nWe need E in position 3.\n\nSo for ""SUPER"", E is in 4.\n\nWhat word has E in position 3 and R in position 5? ""LATER"" is L-A-T-E-R, but A and T absent.\n\n""PIPER"" is P-I-P-E-R, I absent.\n\n""BOXER"" B-O-X-E-R, E in 4.\n\n""MAKER"" M-A-K-E-R, A absent.\n\n""USER"" U-S-E-R, but 4 letters.\n\n""BASER"" B-A-S-E-R, A absent.\n\nIt\'s hard. ""OAKER"" not word.\n\nPerhaps ""OGEED"" not word.\n\nAnother idea: ""EYRES"" E-Y-R-E-S, but E in 1 and 4.\n\nI think it\'s difficult to find with E in 3 and R in 5.\n\nPerhaps R in 4 with E in 3: we had the structure [1] [2] E R [5]\n\nWords: ""UMPER"" not word.\n\n""UMBER"" U-M-B-E-R -> but E in 4.\n\n""AMBER"" A absent.\n\n""EMBER"" E-M-B-E-R -> E in 1 and 4, not 3.\n\nI think we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters, or try a different approach.\n\nLet\'s list all possible positions for the known letters.\n\nR: positions 3,4,5\nE: positions 1,2,3\nS: positions 1,2,4,5\n\nWe need to assign positions that are compatible.\n\nFor example:\n- If E is in 1, then S can be in 2,4,5 and R in 3,4,5.\n- If E is in 2, then S in 1,4,5 and R in 3,4,5.\n- If E is in 3, then S in 1,2,4,5 and R in 4,5 (since R cannot be in 3 if E is there).\n\nAlso, the positions must be distinct.\n\nNow, let\'s try to find words that fit.\n\nStart with E in position 1: E _ _ _ _\n  - S could be in 2: E S _ _ _\n    - R in 3: E S R _ _ -> ""ESPRY"", ""ESKER"", ""ESTER"" (but T absent) T is absent, so ""ESTER"" invalid. ""ESKER"" is valid.\n  - S in 4: E _ _ S _\n    - R in 3: E _ R S _ -> ""EERSS"" not word or ""EORLS"" not.\n    - R in 5: E _ _ S R -> ""EAUSR"" not or ""EMMES"" not.\n  - S in 5: E _ _ _ S\n    - R in 3: E _ R _ S -> ""EARLS"" A absent, ""EERKS"" not, ""EORDS"" not.\n    - R in 4: E _ _ R S -> ""EURES"" not common, ""EILRS"" I absent.\n\nSo only ""ESKER"" seems possible for E in 1 and S in 2 and R in 3.\n\nBut ""ESKER"" has K, which is new.\n\nNow, E in position 2: _ E _ _ _\n  - S in 1: S E _ _ _\n    - R in 3: S E R _ _ -> ""SERGE"", ""SERFS"", ""SEROW"", ""SERED"" (D)\n    - R in 4: S E _ R _ -> ""SEDER"" (D, but E repeated) or ""SEGAR"" (G, but A absent) or ""SEWAR"" not common.\n    - R in 5: S E _ _ R -> ""SEWER"" (W, E repeated), ""SEGGR"" not.\n  - S in 4: _ E _ S _\n    - R in 3: _ E R S _ -> ""VERSO"" (V,O), ""PERPS"" not, ""HERSE"" (H,E repeated)\n    - R in 5: _ E _ S R -> ""MESYR"" not or ""FESOR"" not.\n  - S in 5: _ E _ _ S\n    - R in 3: _ E R _ S -> ""HEROS"" (H,O), ""DERMS"" (D,M), ""FERNS"" (F,N absent) invalid, ""PERPS"" not.\n    - R in 4: _ E _ R S -> ""AEROS"" A absent, ""EERKS"" not, ""LORES"" L,O -> ""LORES"" is L-O-R-E-S, which is L(1),O(2),R(3),E(4),S(5) -> but we have E in position 4, not 2. We need E in position 2.\n\nFor ""HEROS"": it is H-E-R-O-S, so H(1), E(2), R(3), O(4), S(5). This fits: E in 2, R in 3, S in 5. And O in 4 and H in 1 are new.\n\nAnd it avoids absent letters: C,A,T,I,N are absent, and H,O are not in that list.\n\nSimilarly, ""DERMS"" is D-E-R-M-S, which is also valid, but M is less common than O.\n\n""HEROS"" is a good choice.\n\nNow, E in position 3: _ _ E _ _\n  - S in 1: S _ E _ _\n    - R in 4: S _ E R _ -> ""SUPER"" U,P but E in 4?

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crate""
- C: absent (x)
- R: present, not in position 2 (-)
- A: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)
- E: present, not in position 5 (-)

Guess 2: ""risen""
- R: present, not in position 1 (-)
- I: absent (x)
- S: present, not in position 3 (-)
- E: present, not in position 4 (-)
- N: absent (x)

Guess 3: ""heros""
- H: absent (x)
- E: present, not in position 2 (-)
- R: present, not in position 3 (-)
- O: absent (x)
- S: present, not in position 5 (-)

From this, we can deduce:

1. **Confirmed absent letters:** C, A, T, I, N, H, O
2. **Confirmed present letters:** R, E, S (they appeared as present in all three guesses)
3. **Position constraints:**
   - R: 
     - Not in position 2 (from ""crate"")
     - Not in position 1 (from ""risen"")
     - Not in position 3 (from ""heros"")
     - Therefore, R must be in position 4 or 5 (since only positions 4 and 5 are left).
   - E:
     - Not in position 5 (from ""crate"")
     - Not in position 4 (from ""risen"")
     - Not in position 2 (from ""heros"")
     - Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 3 (positions 1 and 3 are the only ones not ruled out).
   - S:
     - Not in position 3 (from ""risen"")
     - Not in position 5 (from ""heros"")
     - Therefore, S must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Additionally, the secret word must contain R, E, and S, and two more letters (since it's a 5-letter word). The absent letters are C, A, T, I, N, H, O, so the remaining possible letters are: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We have 3 guesses left.

We need to choose a word that:
- Includes R, E, S
- Excludes C, A, T, I, N, H, O
- Places R in position 4 or 5
- Places E in position 1 or 3
- Places S in position 1, 2, or 4 (but note: positions must be distinct)

Also, we need to test the remaining two letters.

Let's consider the possibilities for E and R:

Case 1: E in position 1
- Then the word is: E _ _ _ _
- R must be in position 4 or 5: E _ _ R _ or E _ _ _ R
- S must be in position 2 or 4 (since not 1 if E is there, and not 3 or 5? But S can be in 4, and if R is in 4, conflict. So if E is in 1, then S can be in 2 or 4, but if R is in 4, then S cannot be in 4, so S must be in 2. If R is in 5, then S can be in 2 or 4.

Case 2: E in position 3
- Then the word is: _ _ E _ _
- R must be in position 4 or 5: _ _ E R _ or _ _ E _ R
- S must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But if R is in 4, then S cannot be in 4, so S in 1,2. If R is in 5, then S in 1,2,4.

We should also try to cover common letters for the unknown positions.

Given the constraints, let's try to form words.

First, try E in position 1: E _ _ _ _
  - Subcase 1: R in position 4: E _ _ R _
    - Then S must be in position 2 (since position 4 is taken by R, and S cannot be in 3 or 5? S can be in 2, and we have positions 3 and 5 for other letters.
    - So: E S _ R _? But S in position 2: E S _ R _
    - We need letters for position 3 and 5, not absent.
    - Possible words: ""ESKER"" (but K and E? and we have E already, but ""ESKER"" is E-S-K-E-R -> but that has E in 1 and 4, but here R is in 4? Conflict. In this structure, we have R in 4, so the fourth letter is R, not E.
    - So: E S [3] R [5]
    - Words: ""ESPRY"" (P, Y) or ""ESTRY"" (T absent) or ""ESBOR"" not a word.
    - ""ESPRY"" is not common. ""ESBOD"" not.
    - Hard to find.

  - Subcase 2: R in position 5: E _ _ _ R
    - Then S can be in position 2 or 4.
    - If S in 2: E S _ _ R
      - Then positions 3 and 4 to fill: E S [3] [4] R
      - Words: ""ESPUR"" not, ""ESKAR"" not, ""ESDOR"" not.
      - ""ESTER"" (T absent) invalid.
      - ""ESKER"" is E-S-K-E-R -> but that has E in 1 and 4, and R in 5. But in this, position 4 is E, not a new letter? And we have E repeated. But it's a word. However, we have E in position 1 and 4, but we know E is present, so it could be. But in feedback, E was always marked present, but we don't know if duplicated. But we can try.
      - ""ESKER"" has K in position 3.
    - If S in 4: E _ _ S R
      - Then positions 2 and 3: E [2] [3] S R
      - Words: ""EUSSR"" not, ""EMMSR"" not, ""EDGSR"" not.
      - ""EGGSR"" not. Hard to find common words.

Now, try E in position 3: _ _ E _ _
  - Subcase 1: R in position 4: _ _ E R _
    - Then S can be in position 1, 2, or 5 (since not 3,4? S can be in 1,2,5, but position 4 is R, so S in 1,2,5.
    - If S in 1: S _ E R _
      - Then position 2 and 5: S [2] E R [5]
      - Words: ""SUERY"" not, ""SAPER"" (A absent), ""SEWER"" (E in 2? But we have E in 3, and ""SEWER"" is S-E-W-E-R -> E in 2 and 4, not 3.
      - ""SOLER"" (O absent) invalid.
      - ""SEDER"" (D, but E repeated) -> S-E-D-E-R, E in 2 and 4.
      - We need a word with E only in position 3. So [2] cannot be E.
      - Possible: ""SWER?"" not. ""SVER?"" not.
      - ""SKERF"" (K,F) -> S-K-E-R-F, which is S(1),K(2),E(3),R(4),F(5). This works, and avoids absent letters.
    - If S in 2: _ S E R _
      - Then position 1 and 5: [1] S E R [5]
      - Words: ""USER?"" not 5, ""ASPER"" (A absent), ""USHER"" (H absent) H is absent, ""OSIER"" (O,I absent).
      - ""MSERF"" not common.
      - ""PSERF"" not.
    - If S in 5: _ _ E R S
      - Then position 1 and 2: [1] [2] E R S
      - Words: ""BERSK"" not, ""VERSO"" (V,O) but O absent, ""FERSD"" not.
      - ""LERMS"" not.

  - Subcase 2: R in position 5: _ _ E _ R
    - Then S can be in position 1, 2, or 4.
    - If S in 1: S _ E _ R
      - Then position 2 and 4: S [2] E [4] R
      - Words: ""SUEDR"" not, ""SLEER"" (L,E repeated), ""SPEER"" not, ""SKEER"" not.
      - ""SWEIR"" not.
      - ""SEWER"" (E in 2 and 4? S-E-W-E-R -> E in 2 and 4, not 3.
      - We need E only in position 3. So [2] and [4] cannot be E.
      - Possible: ""SKEAR"" not, ""SPEAR"" (A absent), ""SMEAR"" (A absent), ""SWEAR"" (A absent).
      - ""SKERM"" not.
      - ""SCURR"" C absent.
    - If S in 2: _ S E _ R
      - Then position 1 and 4: [1] S E [4] R
      - Words: ""USER?"" not, ""OSIER"" O,I absent, ""ASPER"" A absent.
      - ""PSERD"" not.
      - ""MSERY"" not.
    - If S in 4: _ _ E S R
      - Then position 1 and 2: [1] [2] E S R
      - Words: ""MESR?"" not, ""YESR?"" not.
      - ""LESR?"" not.
      - ""PESKY"" is P-E-S-K-Y, but E in 2, not 3.

After exploring, one feasible word from above is ""SKERF"" for the case where E is in position 3 and R in position 4, with S in position 1. But ""SKERF"" is not very common.

Another possibility: E in position 3, R in position 5, and S in position 1: S _ E _ R
  - We need a word like S [2] E [4] R, with [2] and [4] not E, and not absent letters.
  - For example, ""SUPER"" (U,P) -> S-U-P-E-R, but E in 4, not 3.
  - ""SOWER"" (O,W) -> S-O-W-E-R, E in 4.
  - ""SEWER"" has E in 2 and 4.
  - ""SAFER"" A absent.
  - ""SEDGY"" D,G but not ending with R.

Perhaps ""SKERS"" not word.

Let's think of common words that fit the constraints.

We know:
- E in 1 or 3
- R in 4 or 5
- S in 1,2,4

But positions must be distinct.

Also, the word has two more letters.

Another idea: since R must be in 4 or 5, and E in 1 or 3, and S in 1,2,4, we can try to set S in position 2.

Then:
- If E in 1: E S _ _ _
  - R in 4 or 5: E S _ R _ or E S _ _ R
- If E in 3: _ S E _ _
  - R in 4 or 5: _ S E R _ or _ S E _ R

For E in 3 and S in 2: _ S E _ _
  - R in 4: _ S E R _
    - Then positions 1 and 5: [1] S E R [5]
    - Words: ""USER?"" not, ""ASPER"" A absent, ""USHER"" H absent, ""ISLER"" I absent.
    - ""PSERY"" not.
    - ""FSERY"" not.
  - R in 5: _ S E _ R
    - Then positions 1 and 4: [1] S E [4] R
    - Words: ""USER?"" not, ""OSIER"" O,I absent, ""ASPER"" A absent.
    - ""MSIER"" not.
    - ""WSIER"" not.

For E in 1 and S in 2: E S _ _ _
  - R in 4: E S _ R _
    - Positions 3 and 5: E S [3] R [5]
    - Words: ""ESPRY"", ""ESKER"", ""ESTER"" T absent.
    - ""ESKER"" is E-S-K-E-R -> but that has E in 1 and 4, but we have R in 4, so position 4 is R, not E. So it must be E-S-[3]-R-[5], so [3] cannot be E. ""ESKER"" has K in 3 and E in 4, but position 4 is R, so conflict.
    - ""ESPAD"" not.
    - ""ESTOP"" O absent and T absent.
  - R in 5: E S _ _ R
    - Positions 3 and 4: E S [3] [4] R
    - Words: ""ESPAR"" A absent, ""ESKAR"" not, ""ESDOR"" not.
    - ""ESPRY"" is E-S-P-R-Y? But that's 5 letters: E(1),S(2),P(3),R(4),Y(5) -> but we have R in 5? Here R is in 4, but we need R in 5. So not.
    - For R in 5, it should be E S [3] [4] R
    - ""ESKER"" is E-S-K-E-R -> positions: E(1),S(2),K(3),E(4),R(5) -> so [3] is K, [4] is E, but we have E in position 1 and 4, and R in 5. This fits the structure for R in 5. And it avoids absent letters except possibly the letters used.

""ESKER"" has E in position 1 and 4, which is allowed since E is present and can be duplicated. And K is new.

Similarly, we have another word: ""ESHER"" but H is absent.

Or ""ESPER"" P, but ""ESPER"" is E-S-P-E-R, same structure.

But ""ESPER"" is a valid word (a rare term for a kind of hope, or a surname).

But let's stick with ""ESKER"" or ""ESPER"".

But in ""ESKER"", K is less common, while in ""ESPER"", P is more common.

But we have to avoid O, which is absent, and ""ESPER"" doesn't have O.

Now, from the feedback of guess 3, we have S not in position 5, but in ""ESKER"", S is in position 2, which is allowed.

Also, E is in position 1 and 4, but we are guessing E in position 1 (which is allowed) and also in 4, but the constraint is that E must be in 1 or 3, and here it is in 1 and 4, so position 1 is covered, and position 4 is additional.

The constraint is that E must appear in position 1 or 3, but it can appear elsewhere too.

Similarly for R: in ""ESKER"", R is in position 5, which is allowed (R in 4 or 5).

S is in position 2, which is allowed (S in 1,2,4).

So ""ESKER"" is a valid guess.

Another common word: ""EVERR"" not.

Or ""EGGER"" G, but E in 1 and 4? ""EGGER"" is E-G-G-E-R, so E(1),G(2),G(3),E(4),R(5). This also fits: E in 1, R in 5, S not present? But we must have S. ""EGGER"" has no S, so invalid because S is present.

We must include S.

So ""ESKER"" has S in position 2.

Similarly, ""ESPED"" not a word.

So I think ""ESKER"" is a possible guess.

But let's see if there are better options.

Another possibility: E in position 3, R in position 5, and S in position 1.

So: S _ E _ R

Then positions 2 and 4: S [2] E [4] R

Words: ""SUEDR"" not, ""SLEER"" (L,E repeated), ""SWEER"" not, ""SPEER"" not, ""SKEER"" not.

""SUPER"" is S-U-P-E-R, but E in 4, not 3.

We need E in position 3, so [3] is E, so the word is S [2] E [4] R.

For example, ""SMEAR"" A absent.

""SWEAR"" A absent.

""SPEAR"" A absent.

""SKEGR"" not.

""SCURR"" C absent.

It's hard.

Perhaps ""SKEPR"" not a word.

So ""ESKER"" seems like a reasonable guess.

But in ""ESKER"", the letters are E, S, K, E, R. So it has two E's.

The feedback will tell us if there are two E's.

We can try ""ESPRY"" but it's not common.

Another word: ""ESKAR"" not valid.

So I'll go with ""ESKER"".

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can try a word with E in position 3 and R in position 4.

For example, with S in position 1: S _ E R _

Then positions 2 and 5: S [2] E R [5]

Words: ""SUERY"" not, ""SAFER"" A absent, ""SEDGY"" D,G -> S-E-D-G-Y? But E in 2, not 3.

We need E in position 3, so it should be S [2] E R [5], so [2] cannot be E.

For example, ""SKERY"" not common, or ""SPERY"" not.

""SKERF"" as I thought earlier: S-K-E-R-F, which is valid.

""SKERF"" is a word (a variant of scarf or a heraldry term), but it's obscure.

Perhaps ""UKASE"" but U and A, and E in 5.

Not.

Given the constraints, ""ESKER"" is more common than ""SKERF"".

So I'll choose ""ESKER"".

But in ""ESKER"", S is in position 2, which is allowed, and we are testing K.

If it's not the word, we get feedback.

So guess: ""ESKER""

But let's double-check the position constraints for E: E must be in 1 or 3. In ""ESKER"", E is in 1 and 4. Position 1 is E, so it satisfies the constraint that E is in position 1 or 3. The constraint doesn't say it can't be in other positions, only that it must be in 1 or 3 (which it is, in 1).

Similarly for R: in position 5, which is allowed (4 or 5).

S in position 2, which is allowed (1,2,4).

And it includes all three.

So it's valid.

Therefore, the guess is ""ESKER"".Based on the accumulated feedback:

- **Absent letters (x)**: C, A, T, I, N, H, O (eliminated).
- **Present letters (-)**: R, E, S (must be included, with specific position constraints).
- **Position constraints**:
  - R: Must be in position 4 or 5 (ruled out positions 1, 2, 3).
  - E: Must be in position 1 or 3 (ruled out positions 2, 4, 5).
  - S: Must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (ruled out positions 3, 5).

For the next guess:
- The word must include R, E, and S.
- It must exclude all absent letters (C, A, T, I, N, H, O).
- To adhere to position constraints and test new letters, the word **""ESKER""** is chosen because:
  - E is in position 1 (allowed).
  - S is in position 2 (allowed).
  - K is a new letter (position 3).
  - E is in position 4 (not constrained, as E can appear elsewhere if duplicated).
  - R is in position 5 (allowed).
- It is a valid English word (meaning a glacial ridge).

This guess tests the possibility of E duplication and the positions of R and S while introducing K.

<guess>esker</guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (crate)**: 
     - C, A, T are absent (x).
     - R is present but not in position 2 (-).
     - E is present but not in position 5 (-).
   - **Guess 2 (risen)**:
     - R is present but not in position 1 (-).
     - I, N are absent (x).
     - S is present but not in position 3 (-).
     - E is present but not in position 4 (-).
   - **Guess 3 (heros)**:
     - H, O are absent (x).
     - E is present but not in position 2 (-).
     - R is present but not in position 3 (-).
     - S is present but not in position 5 (-).

2. **Deductions**:
   - **Absent Letters**: C, A, T, I, N, H, O (cannot appear in the word).
   - **Present Letters**: R, E, S (must appear at least once, with possible duplicates).
   - **Position Constraints**:
     - **R**: Cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from feedback). Must be in **position 4 or 5**.
     - **E**: Cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from feedback). Must be in **position 1 or 3**.
     - **S**: Cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from feedback). Must be in **position 1, 2, or 4**.
   - **Word Structure**: The word must include R, E, S and two new letters (not absent). With 3 guesses left, prioritize testing common unused letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y) and validating positions.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - **Address E Position**: E must be in position 1 or 3. Testing E in position 1 is efficient (covers one of the two options).
   - **Address R Position**: R must be in position 4 or 5. Pairing R in position 5 with E in position 1 avoids conflicts.
   - **Address S Position**: S must be in position 1, 2, or 4. With E in position 1, S can be in position 2 or 4 (position 1 is taken by E).
   - **Maximize Information**: Use a word with E in position 1, S in position 2, and R in position 5 to test these constraints. Include new common letters (e.g., K) for coverage.
   - **Word Selection**: ""ESKER"" fits:
     - E in position 1 (allowed).
     - S in position 2 (allowed).
     - K (new letter) in position 3.
     - E in position 4 (not constrained; possible duplicate).
     - R in position 5 (allowed).
   - **Why ""ESKER""?**:
     - Validates E in position 1 and R in position 5.
     - Tests S in position 2 and potential E duplication.
     - Introduces K (common unused letter).
     - Avoids all absent letters (C, A, T, I, N, H, O).
     - Is a valid English word (meaning a glacial ridge).

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If E in position 1 is correct, feedback will show ✓ for E.
   - If R in position 5 is correct, feedback will show ✓ for R.
   - Feedback on S (position 2) and K (position 3) will reveal if they are present/absent or in the right position.
   - Duplicate E (position 4) may provide additional clues.

<guess>esker</guess>",esker,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crate""
- C: absent (x)
- R: present, not in position 2 (-)
- A: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)
- E: present, not in position 5 (-)

Guess 2: ""risen""
- R: present, not in position 1 (-)
- I: absent (x)
- S: present, not in position 3 (-)
- E: present, not in position 4 (-)
- N: absent (x)

Guess 3: ""heros""
- H: absent (x)
- E: present, not in position 2 (-)
- R: present, not in position 3 (-)
- O: absent (x)
- S: present, not in position 5 (-)

From this, we can deduce:

1. **Confirmed absent letters:** C, A, T, I, N, H, O
2. **Confirmed present letters:** R, E, S (they appeared as present in all three guesses)
3. **Position constraints:**
   - R: 
     - Not in position 2 (from ""crate"")
     - Not in position 1 (from ""risen"")
     - Not in position 3 (from ""heros"")
     - Therefore, R must be in position 4 or 5 (since only positions 4 and 5 are left).
   - E:
     - Not in position 5 (from ""crate"")
     - Not in position 4 (from ""risen"")
     - Not in position 2 (from ""heros"")
     - Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 3 (positions 1 and 3 are the only ones not ruled out).
   - S:
     - Not in position 3 (from ""risen"")
     - Not in position 5 (from ""heros"")
     - Therefore, S must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Additionally, the secret word must contain R, E, and S, and two more letters (since it's a 5-letter word). The absent letters are C, A, T, I, N, H, O, so the remaining possible letters are: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We have 3 guesses left.

We need to choose a word that:
- Includes R, E, S
- Excludes C, A, T, I, N, H, O
- Places R in position 4 or 5
- Places E in position 1 or 3
- Places S in position 1, 2, or 4 (but note: positions must be distinct)

Also, we need to test the remaining two letters.

Let's consider the possibilities for E and R:

Case 1: E in position 1
- Then the word is: E _ _ _ _
- R must be in position 4 or 5: E _ _ R _ or E _ _ _ R
- S must be in position 2 or 4 (since not 1 if E is there, and not 3 or 5? But S can be in 4, and if R is in 4, conflict. So if E is in 1, then S can be in 2 or 4, but if R is in 4, then S cannot be in 4, so S must be in 2. If R is in 5, then S can be in 2 or 4.

Case 2: E in position 3
- Then the word is: _ _ E _ _
- R must be in position 4 or 5: _ _ E R _ or _ _ E _ R
- S must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But if R is in 4, then S cannot be in 4, so S in 1,2. If R is in 5, then S in 1,2,4.

We should also try to cover common letters for the unknown positions.

Given the constraints, let's try to form words.

First, try E in position 1: E _ _ _ _
  - Subcase 1: R in position 4: E _ _ R _
    - Then S must be in position 2 (since position 4 is taken by R, and S cannot be in 3 or 5? S can be in 2, and we have positions 3 and 5 for other letters.
    - So: E S _ R _? But S in position 2: E S _ R _
    - We need letters for position 3 and 5, not absent.
    - Possible words: ""ESKER"" (but K and E? and we have E already, but ""ESKER"" is E-S-K-E-R -> but that has E in 1 and 4, but here R is in 4? Conflict. In this structure, we have R in 4, so the fourth letter is R, not E.
    - So: E S [3] R [5]
    - Words: ""ESPRY"" (P, Y) or ""ESTRY"" (T absent) or ""ESBOR"" not a word.
    - ""ESPRY"" is not common. ""ESBOD"" not.
    - Hard to find.

  - Subcase 2: R in position 5: E _ _ _ R
    - Then S can be in position 2 or 4.
    - If S in 2: E S _ _ R
      - Then positions 3 and 4 to fill: E S [3] [4] R
      - Words: ""ESPUR"" not, ""ESKAR"" not, ""ESDOR"" not.
      - ""ESTER"" (T absent) invalid.
      - ""ESKER"" is E-S-K-E-R -> but that has E in 1 and 4, and R in 5. But in this, position 4 is E, not a new letter? And we have E repeated. But it's a word. However, we have E in position 1 and 4, but we know E is present, so it could be. But in feedback, E was always marked present, but we don't know if duplicated. But we can try.
      - ""ESKER"" has K in position 3.
    - If S in 4: E _ _ S R
      - Then positions 2 and 3: E [2] [3] S R
      - Words: ""EUSSR"" not, ""EMMSR"" not, ""EDGSR"" not.
      - ""EGGSR"" not. Hard to find common words.

Now, try E in position 3: _ _ E _ _
  - Subcase 1: R in position 4: _ _ E R _
    - Then S can be in position 1, 2, or 5 (since not 3,4? S can be in 1,2,5, but position 4 is R, so S in 1,2,5.
    - If S in 1: S _ E R _
      - Then position 2 and 5: S [2] E R [5]
      - Words: ""SUERY"" not, ""SAPER"" (A absent), ""SEWER"" (E in 2? But we have E in 3, and ""SEWER"" is S-E-W-E-R -> E in 2 and 4, not 3.
      - ""SOLER"" (O absent) invalid.
      - ""SEDER"" (D, but E repeated) -> S-E-D-E-R, E in 2 and 4.
      - We need a word with E only in position 3. So [2] cannot be E.
      - Possible: ""SWER?"" not. ""SVER?"" not.
      - ""SKERF"" (K,F) -> S-K-E-R-F, which is S(1),K(2),E(3),R(4),F(5). This works, and avoids absent letters.
    - If S in 2: _ S E R _
      - Then position 1 and 5: [1] S E R [5]
      - Words: ""USER?"" not 5, ""ASPER"" (A absent), ""USHER"" (H absent) H is absent, ""OSIER"" (O,I absent).
      - ""MSERF"" not common.
      - ""PSERF"" not.
    - If S in 5: _ _ E R S
      - Then position 1 and 2: [1] [2] E R S
      - Words: ""BERSK"" not, ""VERSO"" (V,O) but O absent, ""FERSD"" not.
      - ""LERMS"" not.

  - Subcase 2: R in position 5: _ _ E _ R
    - Then S can be in position 1, 2, or 4.
    - If S in 1: S _ E _ R
      - Then position 2 and 4: S [2] E [4] R
      - Words: ""SUEDR"" not, ""SLEER"" (L,E repeated), ""SPEER"" not, ""SKEER"" not.
      - ""SWEIR"" not.
      - ""SEWER"" (E in 2 and 4? S-E-W-E-R -> E in 2 and 4, not 3.
      - We need E only in position 3. So [2] and [4] cannot be E.
      - Possible: ""SKEAR"" not, ""SPEAR"" (A absent), ""SMEAR"" (A absent), ""SWEAR"" (A absent).
      - ""SKERM"" not.
      - ""SCURR"" C absent.
    - If S in 2: _ S E _ R
      - Then position 1 and 4: [1] S E [4] R
      - Words: ""USER?"" not, ""OSIER"" O,I absent, ""ASPER"" A absent.
      - ""PSERD"" not.
      - ""MSERY"" not.
    - If S in 4: _ _ E S R
      - Then position 1 and 2: [1] [2] E S R
      - Words: ""MESR?"" not, ""YESR?"" not.
      - ""LESR?"" not.
      - ""PESKY"" is P-E-S-K-Y, but E in 2, not 3.

After exploring, one feasible word from above is ""SKERF"" for the case where E is in position 3 and R in position 4, with S in position 1. But ""SKERF"" is not very common.

Another possibility: E in position 3, R in position 5, and S in position 1: S _ E _ R
  - We need a word like S [2] E [4] R, with [2] and [4] not E, and not absent letters.
  - For example, ""SUPER"" (U,P) -> S-U-P-E-R, but E in 4, not 3.
  - ""SOWER"" (O,W) -> S-O-W-E-R, E in 4.
  - ""SEWER"" has E in 2 and 4.
  - ""SAFER"" A absent.
  - ""SEDGY"" D,G but not ending with R.

Perhaps ""SKERS"" not word.

Let's think of common words that fit the constraints.

We know:
- E in 1 or 3
- R in 4 or 5
- S in 1,2,4

But positions must be distinct.

Also, the word has two more letters.

Another idea: since R must be in 4 or 5, and E in 1 or 3, and S in 1,2,4, we can try to set S in position 2.

Then:
- If E in 1: E S _ _ _
  - R in 4 or 5: E S _ R _ or E S _ _ R
- If E in 3: _ S E _ _
  - R in 4 or 5: _ S E R _ or _ S E _ R

For E in 3 and S in 2: _ S E _ _
  - R in 4: _ S E R _
    - Then positions 1 and 5: [1] S E R [5]
    - Words: ""USER?"" not, ""ASPER"" A absent, ""USHER"" H absent, ""ISLER"" I absent.
    - ""PSERY"" not.
    - ""FSERY"" not.
  - R in 5: _ S E _ R
    - Then positions 1 and 4: [1] S E [4] R
    - Words: ""USER?"" not, ""OSIER"" O,I absent, ""ASPER"" A absent.
    - ""MSIER"" not.
    - ""WSIER"" not.

For E in 1 and S in 2: E S _ _ _
  - R in 4: E S _ R _
    - Positions 3 and 5: E S [3] R [5]
    - Words: ""ESPRY"", ""ESKER"", ""ESTER"" T absent.
    - ""ESKER"" is E-S-K-E-R -> but that has E in 1 and 4, but we have R in 4, so position 4 is R, not E. So it must be E-S-[3]-R-[5], so [3] cannot be E. ""ESKER"" has K in 3 and E in 4, but position 4 is R, so conflict.
    - ""ESPAD"" not.
    - ""ESTOP"" O absent and T absent.
  - R in 5: E S _ _ R
    - Positions 3 and 4: E S [3] [4] R
    - Words: ""ESPAR"" A absent, ""ESKAR"" not, ""ESDOR"" not.
    - ""ESPRY"" is E-S-P-R-Y? But that's 5 letters: E(1),S(2),P(3),R(4),Y(5) -> but we have R in 5? Here R is in 4, but we need R in 5. So not.
    - For R in 5, it should be E S [3] [4] R
    - ""ESKER"" is E-S-K-E-R -> positions: E(1),S(2),K(3),E(4),R(5) -> so [3] is K, [4] is E, but we have E in position 1 and 4, and R in 5. This fits the structure for R in 5. And it avoids absent letters except possibly the letters used.

""ESKER"" has E in position 1 and 4, which is allowed since E is present and can be duplicated. And K is new.

Similarly, we have another word: ""ESHER"" but H is absent.

Or ""ESPER"" P, but ""ESPER"" is E-S-P-E-R, same structure.

But ""ESPER"" is a valid word (a rare term for a kind of hope, or a surname).

But let's stick with ""ESKER"" or ""ESPER"".

But in ""ESKER"", K is less common, while in ""ESPER"", P is more common.

But we have to avoid O, which is absent, and ""ESPER"" doesn't have O.

Now, from the feedback of guess 3, we have S not in position 5, but in ""ESKER"", S is in position 2, which is allowed.

Also, E is in position 1 and 4, but we are guessing E in position 1 (which is allowed) and also in 4, but the constraint is that E must be in 1 or 3, and here it is in 1 and 4, so position 1 is covered, and position 4 is additional.

The constraint is that E must appear in position 1 or 3, but it can appear elsewhere too.

Similarly for R: in ""ESKER"", R is in position 5, which is allowed (R in 4 or 5).

S is in position 2, which is allowed (S in 1,2,4).

So ""ESKER"" is a valid guess.

Another common word: ""EVERR"" not.

Or ""EGGER"" G, but E in 1 and 4? ""EGGER"" is E-G-G-E-R, so E(1),G(2),G(3),E(4),R(5). This also fits: E in 1, R in 5, S not present? But we must have S. ""EGGER"" has no S, so invalid because S is present.

We must include S.

So ""ESKER"" has S in position 2.

Similarly, ""ESPED"" not a word.

So I think ""ESKER"" is a possible guess.

But let's see if there are better options.

Another possibility: E in position 3, R in position 5, and S in position 1.

So: S _ E _ R

Then positions 2 and 4: S [2] E [4] R

Words: ""SUEDR"" not, ""SLEER"" (L,E repeated), ""SWEER"" not, ""SPEER"" not, ""SKEER"" not.

""SUPER"" is S-U-P-E-R, but E in 4, not 3.

We need E in position 3, so [3] is E, so the word is S [2] E [4] R.

For example, ""SMEAR"" A absent.

""SWEAR"" A absent.

""SPEAR"" A absent.

""SKEGR"" not.

""SCURR"" C absent.

It's hard.

Perhaps ""SKEPR"" not a word.

So ""ESKER"" seems like a reasonable guess.

But in ""ESKER"", the letters are E, S, K, E, R. So it has two E's.

The feedback will tell us if there are two E's.

We can try ""ESPRY"" but it's not common.

Another word: ""ESKAR"" not valid.

So I'll go with ""ESKER"".

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can try a word with E in position 3 and R in position 4.

For example, with S in position 1: S _ E R _

Then positions 2 and 5: S [2] E R [5]

Words: ""SUERY"" not, ""SAFER"" A absent, ""SEDGY"" D,G -> S-E-D-G-Y? But E in 2, not 3.

We need E in position 3, so it should be S [2] E R [5], so [2] cannot be E.

For example, ""SKERY"" not common, or ""SPERY"" not.

""SKERF"" as I thought earlier: S-K-E-R-F, which is valid.

""SKERF"" is a word (a variant of scarf or a heraldry term), but it's obscure.

Perhaps ""UKASE"" but U and A, and E in 5.

Not.

Given the constraints, ""ESKER"" is more common than ""SKERF"".

So I'll choose ""ESKER"".

But in ""ESKER"", S is in position 2, which is allowed, and we are testing K.

If it's not the word, we get feedback.

So guess: ""ESKER""

But let's double-check the position constraints for E: E must be in 1 or 3. In ""ESKER"", E is in 1 and 4. Position 1 is E, so it satisfies the constraint that E is in position 1 or 3. The constraint doesn't say it can't be in other positions, only that it must be in 1 or 3 (which it is, in 1).

Similarly for R: in position 5, which is allowed (4 or 5).

S in position 2, which is allowed (1,2,4).

And it includes all three.

So it's valid.

Therefore, the guess is ""ESKER"".Based on the accumulated feedback:

- **Absent letters (x)**: C, A, T, I, N, H, O (eliminated).
- **Present letters (-)**: R, E, S (must be included, with specific position constraints).
- **Position constraints**:
  - R: Must be in position 4 or 5 (ruled out positions 1, 2, 3).
  - E: Must be in position 1 or 3 (ruled out positions 2, 4, 5).
  - S: Must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (ruled out positions 3, 5).

For the next guess:
- The word must include R, E, and S.
- It must exclude all absent letters (C, A, T, I, N, H, O).
- To adhere to position constraints and test new letters, the word **""ESKER""** is chosen because:
  - E is in position 1 (allowed).
  - S is in position 2 (allowed).
  - K is a new letter (position 3).
  - E is in position 4 (not constrained, as E can appear elsewhere if duplicated).
  - R is in position 5 (allowed).
- It is a valid English word (meaning a glacial ridge).

This guess tests the possibility of E duplication and the positions of R and S while introducing K.

<guess>esker</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (crate)**: 
     - C, A, T are absent (x).
     - R is present but not in position 2 (-).
     - E is present but not in position 5 (-).
   - **Guess 2 (risen)**:
     - R is present but not in position 1 (-).
     - I, N are absent (x).
     - S is present but not in position 3 (-).
     - E is present but not in position 4 (-).
   - **Guess 3 (heros)**:
     - H, O are absent (x).
     - E is present but not in position 2 (-).
     - R is present but not in position 3 (-).
     - S is present but not in position 5 (-).

2. **Deductions**:
   - **Absent Letters**: C, A, T, I, N, H, O (cannot appear in the word).
   - **Present Letters**: R, E, S (must appear at least once, with possible duplicates).
   - **Position Constraints**:
     - **R**: Cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from feedback). Must be in **position 4 or 5**.
     - **E**: Cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from feedback). Must be in **position 1 or 3**.
     - **S**: Cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from feedback). Must be in **position 1, 2, or 4**.
   - **Word Structure**: The word must include R, E, S and two new letters (not absent). With 3 guesses left, prioritize testing common unused letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y) and validating positions.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - **Address E Position**: E must be in position 1 or 3. Testing E in position 1 is efficient (covers one of the two options).
   - **Address R Position**: R must be in position 4 or 5. Pairing R in position 5 with E in position 1 avoids conflicts.
   - **Address S Position**: S must be in position 1, 2, or 4. With E in position 1, S can be in position 2 or 4 (position 1 is taken by E).
   - **Maximize Information**: Use a word with E in position 1, S in position 2, and R in position 5 to test these constraints. Include new common letters (e.g., K) for coverage.
   - **Word Selection**: ""ESKER"" fits:
     - E in position 1 (allowed).
     - S in position 2 (allowed).
     - K (new letter) in position 3.
     - E in position 4 (not constrained; possible duplicate).
     - R in position 5 (allowed).
   - **Why ""ESKER""?**:
     - Validates E in position 1 and R in position 5.
     - Tests S in position 2 and potential E duplication.
     - Introduces K (common unused letter).
     - Avoids all absent letters (C, A, T, I, N, H, O).
     - Is a valid English word (meaning a glacial ridge).

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If E in position 1 is correct, feedback will show ✓ for E.
   - If R in position 5 is correct, feedback will show ✓ for R.
   - Feedback on S (position 2) and K (position 3) will reveal if they are present/absent or in the right position.
   - Duplicate E (position 4) may provide additional clues.",Guess 4: esker -> FEEDBACK: E(-) S(-) K(x) E(-) R(-),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Alright, the user is asking me to make my first guess in what seems like a word-guessing game similar to Wordle. Since it's the first turn and I have zero information, I need a strategic starting word. 

Hmm... optimal first guesses usually prioritize common letters and vowel-consonant balance to maximize information gain. Words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" come to mind—they're popular among enthusiasts because they cover frequent letters and include vowels. 

But wait, should I pick something that includes ""S""? Many plurals end with S, but since the word is exactly 5 letters, ending with S might be less likely. Alternatively, ""ADIEU"" focuses on vowels but leaves out common consonants. 

After some thought, ""CRATE"" feels balanced: it has two vowels (A,E) and three consonants (C,R,T) which all appear frequently in English. The letters C, R, A, T, and E give good coverage across different positions. Plus, none are overly rare—like Q or Z. 

This choice should likely reveal several hits or misses, especially since E and T are among the most common letters. If I get feedback showing correct positions or existing letters elsewhere, future guesses will narrow down faster. 

I'll commit to ""CRATE"" for now—it's methodical enough to set up the next move efficiently.I'm starting with ""CRATE"" because it's a balanced word containing common letters: 
- **C**, **R**, **T** are frequent consonants  
- **A** and **E** are the most common vowels  
This maximizes the chance of revealing correct letters/positions early.

<guess>crate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crate"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C, A, T are not in the secret word at all.
- The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position.
- The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

Therefore, the secret word must contain R and E, and does not contain C, A, or T.

We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, A, T (since they are absent)
- Must include R and E (since they are present, but in different positions)
- We also know that R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5.

We can use this information to form our next guess.

Let's think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, T.

Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

Possible letters to consider: We have 26 letters, minus C, A, T, so 23 left. But we also know the word has R and E.

We should try to cover more common letters to get more information.

Common consonants besides R: S, L, N, etc. Common vowels: E (we already have), and then O, I, U.

We also know that R is in the word but not in position 2. So R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: the word is 5 letters.

Similarly, E is in the word but not in position 5, so E could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We should avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5 in our next guess.

Let's try to think of words that have R and E, and also include other common letters we haven't tried yet, such as S, L, N, O, I, etc.

Some candidate words:

- ""robes"": but has S? Let's check: R in position 1 (which is allowed, since we don't know if R is in 1 or not), O, B, E, S. But we don't know about B and S. Also, E is in position 4 (not 5, so that's allowed). However, we don't know if O, B, S are in the word.

But note: we have to avoid A, C, T. ""robes"" doesn't have A, C, T. So it's a candidate.

But we might want to use a word that has more common letters to maximize information.

Another candidate: ""risen"" - R in position 1, I, S, E, N. E is in position 4. This avoids A, C, T.

But we know that in the first guess, R was in position 2 and was marked as wrong position. Now we are putting R in position 1. It might be that R is actually in position 1? Or it might be in 3,4,5. We don't know.

Alternatively, we could try to put R in a different position to test.

But note: we have two letters we know: R and E. We should try to place them in positions we haven't ruled out.

We also have three other positions to guess. We should try to use new common letters.

Another idea: ""reign"" - R in 1, E in 2, I, G, N. But E is in position 2? We don't know if E can be in position 2. The feedback only said E is not in position 5, so position 2 is allowed. Similarly, R in position 1 is allowed.

But we have to remember that R was originally in position 2 and was wrong. Now we are moving R to position 1. If the secret word has R in position 1, then we would get a check. If not, then we know R is in 3,4, or 5.

Similarly, E was in position 5 and was wrong, now we put it in position 2. If it's correct, we get a check; if not, then we know it's in 3 or 4.

But we also want to test other letters.

Another candidate: ""liner"" - L, I, N, E, R. But note: E is in position 4 and R in position 5. This avoids A, C, T. Also, we haven't tried L, I, N.

But we have to be cautious: if we put R in position 5, that might be a new position. Similarly, E in position 4.

However, we know that E cannot be in position 5, but position 4 is allowed. And R cannot be in position 2, but position 5 is allowed.

But note: the word ""liner"" has R at the end. That might be a good test.

But let me think of more words.

Another common word: ""rouse"" - R in 1, O, U, S, E. E in position 5? Wait, we cannot put E in position 5 because we know E is not in position 5. So ""rouse"" has E in position 5 -> invalid because we know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5, so we can have E in other positions. But if we put E in position 5, we know it will be marked as wrong position (if the word has E) or absent? But we know E is present, so if we put it in position 5, it will be marked as '-' (wrong position) because we know it's not in position 5. But that doesn't give new information. So it's better to put E in a position that we haven't tried and that is allowed (1,2,3,4).

Similarly for R: avoid position 2.

So ""rouse"" is not ideal because E is in position 5.

We can try ""rodes"" or ""rides"", but we don't know about D or S.

Another idea: ""resin"" - R in 1, E in 2, S, I, N. This has E in position 2 and R in position 1. It avoids A, C, T.

But we might also consider ""rinse"" - R in 1, I, N, S, E. E in position 5? Again, we know E is not in position 5, so we avoid that.

So ""rinse"" is not good because of E at the end.

Similarly, ""risen"" has E in position 4: R(1), I(2), S(3), E(4), N(5). That seems okay.

But in ""risen"", R is in position 1 and E in position 4.

We also have the letter I, S, N to test.

Alternatively, we can try a word that puts R in a different position, say position 3 or 4.

For example, ""beryl"" - B, E, R, Y, L. But we don't know about B, Y, L. And E is in position 2, R in position 3.

This avoids A, C, T.

But ""beryl"" is a less common word? We should stick to common words.

Another common word: ""peril"" - P, E, R, I, L. E in position 2, R in position 3. Avoids A, C, T.

But we haven't tested P, I, L.

We could also try ""urged"" - U, R, G, E, D. But U and G and D are less common? And E is in position 4, R in position 2? Wait, we cannot put R in position 2 because we know R is not in position 2. So ""urged"" has R in position 2 -> that would be invalid because we know R is not in position 2. So we must avoid putting R in position 2.

Similarly, we must avoid E in position 5.

So in our next guess, R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.

Let me list some words that have R and E, and avoid A, C, T, and with R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.

Possible words:

- ""robed"": R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), D(5) -> but E is in position 4? Wait, position 4 is allowed. But we have D at the end? And we don't know about O, B, D.

- ""robes"": as I thought earlier: R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), S(5). E is in position 4, which is allowed. R in position 1, which is allowed. We test O, B, S.

- ""ropes"": R(1), O(2), P(3), E(4), S(5). Similar.

- ""rides"": R(1), I(2), D(3), E(4), S(5). But R is in position 1, E in position 4. We test I, D, S.

- ""riles"": R(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). Same.

But note: in all these, we are putting R in position 1. What if R is not in position 1? Then we will get a '-' for R, and we know it must be in 3,4, or 5.

Alternatively, we can put R in position 3 or 4 to test other possibilities.

For example, ""wired"": W(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). But E is in position 4, which is allowed. R is in position 3, which is allowed. We test W, I, D.

But W is not very common.

""fired"": F(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). Same.

""hired"": H(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), D(5).

But we might get more information if we use more common letters.

Another idea: since we have two letters to place (R and E) and three new letters, we should choose common letters for the other positions.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, L, N, O, I, D, etc.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and must be valid.

I think ""risen"" is a good candidate: R in 1, I in 2, S in 3, E in 4, N in 5. This tests R in position 1, E in position 4, and also tests I, S, N.

But note: we know that E is not in position 5, but in ""risen"", E is in position 4, which is fine. And R is in position 1, which is not the second position (which we know is wrong for R).

Alternatively, ""robin"" but ""robin"" doesn't have E? We know the word must have E, so we must include E.

So we must have both R and E.

Another word: ""reign"" - R(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5). This has E in position 2, which is allowed. And R in position 1. We test I, G, N.

But we don't know if E can be in position 2. It might be, or it might not.

Similarly, we can try ""reins"" - R(1), E(2), I(3), N(4), S(5). But E is in position 2 and we have S at the end. But note: we know E is not in position 5, but in this word, E is in position 2, so that's allowed.

But in ""reins"", we have E in position 2. If the secret word has E in position 2, we get a check. If not, we get a '-'.

But we also have R in position 1.

I think either ""risen"" or ""reign"" or ""ropes"" are fine.

But let me consider the feedback we got: in the first guess, R was in position 2 and was marked as wrong position. That means R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 1, and if it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R must be in position 3,4, or 5.

Similarly for E: it was in position 5 and was wrong, so if we put E in position 4 (like in ""risen"") and it is correct, we get a check; if not, we get a '-' and then we know E must be in position 1,2, or 3.

So to maximize information, we might want to test R in a new position and E in a new position.

But we have limited tries.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has R and E and also includes other common letters that we haven't eliminated.

I think ""ropes"" is a good choice: R in 1, O in 2, P in 3, E in 4, S in 5. We test O, P, S, and also the positions for R and E.

But note: we know that the secret word does not have A, C, T, so we are safe.

Another common word: ""lives"" but that has V and S, and no R? We must include R and E.

""liver"" - L, I, V, E, R. This has E in position 4 and R in position 5. So E is in position 4 (allowed) and R in position 5 (allowed, since we only know it's not in position 2). We test L, I, V.

But V is less common.

I think ""ropes"" is better.

But let me check if ""ropes"" is valid: yes.

We could also use ""roses"", but that has S twice? And we don't know about S. But ""roses"" has R in 1, O in 2, S in 3, E in 4, S in 5. But we have two S's. It might be okay, but we don't know if the word has S.

But we are trying to test multiple letters.

To avoid duplication, ""ropes"" has unique letters: R, O, P, E, S. That's good.

Similarly, ""risen"" has R, I, S, E, N.

I think I'll go with ""risen"" because it includes I, S, N which are common.

But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was absent, so we avoid A. But we haven't tested I, S, N.

So ""risen"" seems good.

But let me see: we have R in position 1 (which might be correct or not), and E in position 4.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Another word: ""renew"" but that has W and two E's? Not ideal.

I think ""risen"" is a solid choice.

But wait, we know that the secret word has R and E, and we are putting R in 1 and E in 4. If the secret word has R in 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus. Similarly for E.

Also, we test I in position 2, S in position 3, N in position 5.

We know that position 2 was R in the first guess and was wrong, but now we are putting I there. It might be correct or not.

So I'll go with ""risen"".

But let me confirm: the word ""risen"" is valid.

So my next guess is ""risen"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":
- C, A, T are **absent** from the secret word.
- R is **present** but not in position 2.
- E is **present** but not in position 5.

For the second guess:
- The word must include **R** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).
- It must **exclude** C, A, T (since they are absent).
- R cannot be placed in position 2 (as per feedback).
- E cannot be placed in position 5 (as per feedback).
- To maximize information, the guess should test new common letters (e.g., S, I, N) and place R and E in positions not yet ruled out (e.g., R in position 1 or 3–5; E in positions 1–4).

The word **""risen""** is chosen because:
- It includes R (position 1) and E (position 4), both in allowed positions.
- It tests new common letters: I (position 2), S (position 3), and N (position 5).
- It avoids C, A, T.
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R and E while providing information on I, S, and N.

<guess>risen</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: risen -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) S(-) E(-) N(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crate""
- C: absent (x)
- R: present, but not in position 2 (-)
- A: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)
- E: present, but not in position 5 (-)

Guess 2: ""risen""
- R: present, but not in position 1 (-) [since it was in position 1 and marked as wrong position]
- I: absent (x)
- S: present, but not in position 3 (-)
- E: present, but not in position 4 (-) [now we know E is not in position 4 or 5]
- N: absent (x)

From this, we can deduce:

1. **Confirmed absent letters:** C, A, T, I, N
2. **Confirmed present letters:** R, E, S (since they were marked present in at least one guess)
3. **Position constraints:**
   - R: Not in position 2 (from guess 1) and not in position 1 (from guess 2). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
   - E: Not in position 5 (from guess 1) and not in position 4 (from guess 2). So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
   - S: Not in position 3 (from guess 2). So S must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Additionally, we know the secret word must contain R, E, and S, and it has exactly 5 letters.

We have used 2 guesses and have 4 remaining.

We need to choose a new word that:
- Includes R, E, S (since they are present)
- Excludes C, A, T, I, N (absent)
- Places R in one of positions 3,4,5
- Places E in one of positions 1,2,3
- Places S in one of positions 1,2,4,5 (avoiding position 3)
- Uses new letters to test for other possible present letters (since we only have 3 confirmed, and the word has 5 letters, so there are 2 more letters to discover)

Common letters not yet tested: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should aim to cover common letters to maximize information.

Let's think of words that fit the constraints.

Possible structure:

- E must be in 1,2,3
- R must be in 3,4,5
- S must be in 1,2,4,5

We also need to avoid positions that are ruled out for each.

One idea: Place E in position 1, then R in position 3 or 4 or 5, and S in position 2,4,5 (but not conflicting).

For example:
- Position 1: E (if we try E in position 1)
- Position 2: S? But S can be in 2, and E in 1 is allowed.
- Then R in 3,4, or 5.

But we need two more letters.

Alternatively, place E in position 2, then R in 3,4,5 and S in 1,4,5.

Let's list possible words:

Try E in position 1:
- E _ _ _ _
  - Then we can have S in position 2: E S _ _ _
    - Then R in 3,4,5: e.g., E S R _ _ (but R in 3) -> but we need two more letters, and avoid absent letters.
    - Words: ""ESPRY"" (but Y is less common, and we don't know if P is present) or ""ESKER"" (but K and E again? and we have E already, but it's allowed if the word has two E's? But we don't know if E is repeated. However, in feedback, E was only marked present once, but it could be repeated? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates. So we have to consider that possibility. But to be safe, let's avoid assuming duplicates for now.

But we need to use common words.

Another idea: Place E in position 3, then R in 3? But E and R both in position 3? No, only one letter per position.

E in position 3 and R in position 4 or 5? That could work.

For example: _ _ E R _ 

But S must be in 1,2,4,5. If we put R in 4, then S cannot be in 4, so S in 1,2,5.

Similarly, if E is in 3, then we have positions 1,2 for other letters and 5 for S or R.

Let me try to form words.

We know the word must have R, E, S and two more letters (not C,A,T,I,N).

Common letters: O, L, D, U, etc.

Try a word with E in position 2? That might be promising.

For example: _ E _ _ _

Then R in 3,4,5 and S in 1,4,5.

If we put S in position 1: S E _ _ _

Then R in 3,4,5: e.g., S E R _ _ (R in 3) -> ""SERUM"" (but U and M, and we don't know) or ""SERIF"" (F) or ""SEROW"" (O and W).

But we have to avoid I (absent) so ""SERIF"" has I? No, I is absent, so we cannot use I. ""SERIF"" has I? S-E-R-I-F -> I is the fourth letter, but we know I is absent, so invalid.

Similarly, ""SERUM"" has U and M, which are not tested.

Another possibility: S in position 1, E in position 2, and R in position 5: S E _ _ R

Then the word must have another letter in position 3 and 4, and we have S, E, and R already, but the word must have 5 distinct? Not necessarily, but we don't know.

Words: ""SEWER"" (but E is repeated, and W) or ""SEPIA"" (but A is absent) or ""SEDGE"" (E repeated, D, G).

But we avoid A, so ""SEPIA"" is out.

""SEWER"" has E twice, which is possible.

But let's see if we can avoid duplicates for now.

Place E in position 3.

So: _ _ E _ _

Then R in 3,4,5 -> but position 3 is taken by E, so R in 4 or 5.

S in 1,2,4,5.

Case 1: R in 4: _ _ E R _
  - Then S in 1,2,5: 
    - If S in 1: S _ E R _
    - If S in 2: _ S E R _
    - If S in 5: _ _ E R S

Case 2: R in 5: _ _ E _ R
  - Then S in 1,2,4: 
    - S in 1: S _ E _ R
    - S in 2: _ S E _ R
    - S in 4: _ _ E S R

Now, we need to fill the remaining positions with letters not in {C,A,T,I,N} and common.

Let's try to form words:

For S in 1 and R in 4: S _ E R _
  - Words: ""SOWER"" (O, W, E) -> but E is in position 3, and we have E already? The word has E at 3 and R at 4. ""SOWER"" is S-O-W-E-R -> positions: S(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5) -> but we have E in position 4? But we placed E in position 3, so this doesn't match.

We have fixed E in position 3, so for case 1 (R in 4): the word is _ _ E R _ , so positions: 1,2, E, R, 5.

So for S in 1: S _ E R _ -> we need a letter for position 2 and 5.

Words: ""SUER?"" but not 5 letters. ""SOLER"" (O, L) -> S-O-L-E-R? But that's S(1),O(2),L(3),E(4),R(5) -> but we have E in position 4, but we wanted E in position 3? I think I confused.

If we set E in position 3 and R in position 4, then the word is: [1] [2] E R [5]

So for example, if S is in position 1: S [2] E R [5]

We need letters for position 2 and 5, not C,A,T,I,N.

Possible words: 
- ""SUERS"" (but S repeated and not common) 
- ""SAYER"" (but A is absent) 
- ""SOBER"" (O, B) -> S-O-B-E-R -> S(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), R(5) -> but we have E in position 4, but we set E to be in position 3? This has E in 4, not 3.

I think I made a mistake: if E is in position 3, then position 3 is E. Then R in position 4, so position 4 is R. Then position 1,2,5 to fill.

So the word is: [1] [2] E R [5]

We cannot have a letter in position 3 because it's E, and position 4 is R.

So the word has five positions: 1,2,3=E,4=R,5.

So for example, ""POWER"" is P-O-W-E-R, which is P(1),O(2),W(3),E(4),R(5) -> but that has E in 4, not 3.

We need a word with E in position 3 and R in position 4.

For example: ""LOWER"" is L-O-W-E-R -> E in 4, not 3.

""BOXER"" is B-O-X-E-R -> same.

""DEFER"" is D-E-F-E-R -> E in 2 and 4.

We need a word with the third letter E and fourth letter R.

Examples: ""RULER"" is R-U-L-E-R -> E in 4.

""TIGER"" is T-I-G-E-R -> E in 4.

I'm struggling. Let me think: ""ORDER"" is O-R-D-E-R -> E in 4.

""OFFER"" is O-F-F-E-R -> E in 4.

What about ""OAKER""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""EYERS"" or something, but not common.

Another idea: ""LEVER"" is L-E-V-E-R -> E in 2 and 4.

We need a word with E in position 3.

For example: ""AXLED"" but not common.

Perhaps I should consider other placements.

Let's try E in position 1.

So: E _ _ _ _

Then R in 3,4,5.

S in 2,4,5 (since not 3).

If S in 2: E S _ _ _

Then R in 3,4,5.

If R in 3: E S R _ _ -> ""ESPRY"" (not common) or ""ESTRO"" (not word) or ""ESKER"" (which is a word, meaning a glacial ridge).

""ESKER"" has E(1), S(2), K(3), E(4), R(5) -> but E is repeated, and we have E in position 1 and 4. But we know E is present, and it could be repeated. Also, K is new.

But let's see feedback: in guess 1, E was present but not in 5, and in guess 2, E was present but not in 4. So if the word has two E's, it's possible.

But we can try.

Another word: E in 1, S in 5, and R in 3: E _ R _ S

Words: ""EARLS"" (but A is absent) or ""EERKS"" not word.

""EURES"" not common.

Place E in position 2.

So: _ E _ _ _

Then R in 3,4,5.

S in 1,4,5.

If S in 1: S E _ _ _

Then R in 3,4,5.

If R in 3: S E R _ _ -> ""SERGE"" (G) or ""SERFS"" (F) or ""SEROW"" (O,W)

If R in 4: S E _ R _ -> ""SEORA"" (A absent) or ""SEPIA"" (A absent) or ""SEDGY"" (D,G,Y) or ""SEDGE"" (D,G,E repeated)

If R in 5: S E _ _ R -> ""SEWER"" (W,E repeated) or ""SEIZR"" not word.

Now, with S in 1, E in 2, R in 5: ""SEWER"" is a word, but has E repeated.

But let's avoid duplicates if possible.

Another option: S in 4 or 5.

For example, with E in 2, and S in 4: _ E _ S _

Then R in 3,4,5 -> but S is in 4, so R cannot be in 4, so R in 3 or 5.

If R in 3: _ E R S _ -> ""BERSK"" not word or ""VERSO"" (V,O) or ""PERSU"" not common.

If R in 5: _ E _ S R -> ""MESER"" not common or ""YESES"" S repeated.

With E in 2, S in 5: _ E _ _ S

Then R in 3,4,5 -> but S is in 5, so R in 3 or 4.

If R in 3: _ E R _ S -> ""HEROS"" (H,O) or ""ZEROS"" (Z,O) or ""FERNS"" (F, but N absent) N is absent, so ""FERNS"" has N, which is absent, invalid.

""HEROS"" is H-E-R-O-S, which is valid, and H, O are new.

Similarly, ""DEROS"" not common.

So ""HEROS"" is a possibility.

But we have to check if it meets: E in position 2, R in position 3, S in position 5. And H in 1, O in 4.

Letters: H, E, R, O, S. All not in absent list.

Similarly, another word: ""ZEROS"" but Z is less common.

Or ""MERES"" but E repeated and S at the end, but ""MERES"" is M-E-R-E-S, so E in 2 and 4, R in 3, S in 5.

But E repeated.

To avoid duplication, ""HEROS"" is better.

But ""HEROS"" is a valid word (plural of hero).

Another option: E in position 3.

Let's find a word with E in position 3 and R in position 5, for example.

So: _ _ E _ R

Then S in 1,2,4.

If S in 1: S _ E _ R -> ""SKEER"" not common or ""SPEER"" not or ""SUPER"" (U,P) -> S-U-P-E-R, which is S(1),U(2),P(3),E(4),R(5) -> but we have E in position 4, not 3.

We need E in position 3.

So for ""SUPER"", E is in 4.

What word has E in position 3 and R in position 5? ""LATER"" is L-A-T-E-R, but A and T absent.

""PIPER"" is P-I-P-E-R, I absent.

""BOXER"" B-O-X-E-R, E in 4.

""MAKER"" M-A-K-E-R, A absent.

""USER"" U-S-E-R, but 4 letters.

""BASER"" B-A-S-E-R, A absent.

It's hard. ""OAKER"" not word.

Perhaps ""OGEED"" not word.

Another idea: ""EYRES"" E-Y-R-E-S, but E in 1 and 4.

I think it's difficult to find with E in 3 and R in 5.

Perhaps R in 4 with E in 3: we had the structure [1] [2] E R [5]

Words: ""UMPER"" not word.

""UMBER"" U-M-B-E-R -> but E in 4.

""AMBER"" A absent.

""EMBER"" E-M-B-E-R -> E in 1 and 4, not 3.

I think we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters, or try a different approach.

Let's list all possible positions for the known letters.

R: positions 3,4,5
E: positions 1,2,3
S: positions 1,2,4,5

We need to assign positions that are compatible.

For example:
- If E is in 1, then S can be in 2,4,5 and R in 3,4,5.
- If E is in 2, then S in 1,4,5 and R in 3,4,5.
- If E is in 3, then S in 1,2,4,5 and R in 4,5 (since R cannot be in 3 if E is there).

Also, the positions must be distinct.

Now, let's try to find words that fit.

Start with E in position 1: E _ _ _ _
  - S could be in 2: E S _ _ _
    - R in 3: E S R _ _ -> ""ESPRY"", ""ESKER"", ""ESTER"" (but T absent) T is absent, so ""ESTER"" invalid. ""ESKER"" is valid.
  - S in 4: E _ _ S _
    - R in 3: E _ R S _ -> ""EERSS"" not word or ""EORLS"" not.
    - R in 5: E _ _ S R -> ""EAUSR"" not or ""EMMES"" not.
  - S in 5: E _ _ _ S
    - R in 3: E _ R _ S -> ""EARLS"" A absent, ""EERKS"" not, ""EORDS"" not.
    - R in 4: E _ _ R S -> ""EURES"" not common, ""EILRS"" I absent.

So only ""ESKER"" seems possible for E in 1 and S in 2 and R in 3.

But ""ESKER"" has K, which is new.

Now, E in position 2: _ E _ _ _
  - S in 1: S E _ _ _
    - R in 3: S E R _ _ -> ""SERGE"", ""SERFS"", ""SEROW"", ""SERED"" (D)
    - R in 4: S E _ R _ -> ""SEDER"" (D, but E repeated) or ""SEGAR"" (G, but A absent) or ""SEWAR"" not common.
    - R in 5: S E _ _ R -> ""SEWER"" (W, E repeated), ""SEGGR"" not.
  - S in 4: _ E _ S _
    - R in 3: _ E R S _ -> ""VERSO"" (V,O), ""PERPS"" not, ""HERSE"" (H,E repeated)
    - R in 5: _ E _ S R -> ""MESYR"" not or ""FESOR"" not.
  - S in 5: _ E _ _ S
    - R in 3: _ E R _ S -> ""HEROS"" (H,O), ""DERMS"" (D,M), ""FERNS"" (F,N absent) invalid, ""PERPS"" not.
    - R in 4: _ E _ R S -> ""AEROS"" A absent, ""EERKS"" not, ""LORES"" L,O -> ""LORES"" is L-O-R-E-S, which is L(1),O(2),R(3),E(4),S(5) -> but we have E in position 4, not 2. We need E in position 2.

For ""HEROS"": it is H-E-R-O-S, so H(1), E(2), R(3), O(4), S(5). This fits: E in 2, R in 3, S in 5. And O in 4 and H in 1 are new.

And it avoids absent letters: C,A,T,I,N are absent, and H,O are not in that list.

Similarly, ""DERMS"" is D-E-R-M-S, which is also valid, but M is less common than O.

""HEROS"" is a good choice.

Now, E in position 3: _ _ E _ _
  - S in 1: S _ E _ _
    - R in 4: S _ E R _ -> ""SUPER"" U,P but E in 4? No, we need E in 3. ""SUPER"" is S-U-P-E-R, E in 4.
      We need a word like S ? E R ? with E in 3 and R in 4.
      ""SAYER"" A absent.
      ""SOBER"" O,B -> S-O-B-E-R, but E in 4.
      I can't find one.
    - R in 5: S _ E _ R -> ""SKEER"" not, ""SPEER"" not, ""SUPER"" E in 4.
  - S in 2: _ S E _ _
    - R in 4: _ S E R _ -> ""ASPER"" A absent, ""USHER"" U,H -> U-S-H-E-R, E in 4.
      ""RS."" not.
    - R in 5: _ S E _ R -> ""OSIER"" O,I absent (I is absent), ""USHER"" E in 4.
  - S in 4: _ _ E S _
    - R in 5: _ _ E S R -> ""MESER"" not, ""YESER"" not.
  - S in 5: _ _ E _ S
    - R in 4: _ _ E R S -> ""BERSK"" not, ""VERSO"" V,O -> V-E-R-S-O, which is V(1),E(2),R(3),S(4),O(5) -> but we have E in position 2, not 3. We need E in 3.

So for E in position 3, it's hard to find a common word.

Therefore, the best options are ""ESKER"" or ""HEROS"".

""HEROS"" seems more common than ""ESKER"".

Also, ""HEROS"" tests H and O, which are common.

So I'll go with ""HEROS"".

In ""HEROS"":
- H is new
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (allowed, since R can be in 3,4,5 and not 1 or 2)
- O in position 4
- S in position 5 (allowed, since S not in 3)

And it meets all constraints.

So the guess is ""HEROS"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Absent letters (x)**: C, A, T, I, N (eliminated from consideration).
- **Present letters (-)**: R, E, S (must be included, but in different positions).
- **Position constraints**:
  - R: Not in position 1 (from ""risen"") or 2 (from ""crate""), so must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
  - E: Not in position 4 (from ""risen"") or 5 (from ""crate""), so must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
  - S: Not in position 3 (from ""risen""), so must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

For the next guess:
- The word must include R, E, and S.
- It must exclude C, A, T, I, N.
- To maximize information, the guess should test new common letters (e.g., H, O) and adhere to the position constraints for R, E, and S.

The word **""HEROS""** is chosen because:
- It includes R (position 3), E (position 2), and S (position 5), all in allowed positions.
- It tests new common letters: H (position 1) and O (position 4).
- It avoids all absent letters.
- It is a valid English word (plural of ""hero"").

This guess will help confirm the positions of R, E, and S while providing information on H and O.

- C: absent (x)

- H: absent (x)
- E: present, not in position 2 (-)
- R: present, not in position 3 (-)
- O: absent (x)
- S: present, not in position 5 (-)

From this, we can deduce:

1. **Confirmed absent letters:** C, A, T, I, N, H, O
2. **Confirmed present letters:** R, E, S (they appeared as present in all three guesses)
3. **Position constraints:**
   - R: 
     - Not in position 2 (from ""crate"")
     - Not in position 1 (from ""risen"")
     - Not in position 3 (from ""heros"")
     - Therefore, R must be in position 4 or 5 (since only positions 4 and 5 are left).
   - E:
     - Not in position 5 (from ""crate"")
     - Not in position 4 (from ""risen"")
     - Not in position 2 (from ""heros"")
     - Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 3 (positions 1 and 3 are the only ones not ruled out).
   - S:
     - Not in position 3 (from ""risen"")
     - Not in position 5 (from ""heros"")
     - Therefore, S must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Additionally, the secret word must contain R, E, and S, and two more letters (since it's a 5-letter word). The absent letters are C, A, T, I, N, H, O, so the remaining possible letters are: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We have 3 guesses left.

We need to choose a word that:
- Includes R, E, S
- Excludes C, A, T, I, N, H, O
- Places R in position 4 or 5
- Places E in position 1 or 3
- Places S in position 1, 2, or 4 (but note: positions must be distinct)

Also, we need to test the remaining two letters.

Let's consider the possibilities for E and R:

Case 1: E in position 1
- Then the word is: E _ _ _ _
- R must be in position 4 or 5: E _ _ R _ or E _ _ _ R
- S must be in position 2 or 4 (since not 1 if E is there, and not 3 or 5? But S can be in 4, and if R is in 4, conflict. So if E is in 1, then S can be in 2 or 4, but if R is in 4, then S cannot be in 4, so S must be in 2. If R is in 5, then S can be in 2 or 4.

Case 2: E in position 3
- Then the word is: _ _ E _ _
- R must be in position 4 or 5: _ _ E R _ or _ _ E _ R
- S must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But if R is in 4, then S cannot be in 4, so S in 1,2. If R is in 5, then S in 1,2,4.

We should also try to cover common letters for the unknown positions.

Given the constraints, let's try to form words.

First, try E in position 1: E _ _ _ _
  - Subcase 1: R in position 4: E _ _ R _
    - Then S must be in position 2 (since position 4 is taken by R, and S cannot be in 3 or 5? S can be in 2, and we have positions 3 and 5 for other letters.
    - So: E S _ R _? But S in position 2: E S _ R _
    - We need letters for position 3 and 5, not absent.
    - Possible words: ""ESKER"" (but K and E? and we have E already, but ""ESKER"" is E-S-K-E-R -> but that has E in 1 and 4, but here R is in 4? Conflict. In this structure, we have R in 4, so the fourth letter is R, not E.
    - So: E S [3] R [5]
    - Words: ""ESPRY"" (P, Y) or ""ESTRY"" (T absent) or ""ESBOR"" not a word.
    - ""ESPRY"" is not common. ""ESBOD"" not.
    - Hard to find.

  - Subcase 2: R in position 5: E _ _ _ R
    - Then S can be in position 2 or 4.
    - If S in 2: E S _ _ R
      - Then positions 3 and 4 to fill: E S [3] [4] R
      - Words: ""ESPUR"" not, ""ESKAR"" not, ""ESDOR"" not.
      - ""ESTER"" (T absent) invalid.
      - ""ESKER"" is E-S-K-E-R -> but that has E in 1 and 4, and R in 5. But in this, position 4 is E, not a new letter? And we have E repeated. But it's a word. However, we have E in position 1 and 4, but we know E is present, so it could be. But in feedback, E was always marked present, but we don't know if duplicated. But we can try.
      - ""ESKER"" has K in position 3.
    - If S in 4: E _ _ S R
      - Then positions 2 and 3: E [2] [3] S R
      - Words: ""EUSSR"" not, ""EMMSR"" not, ""EDGSR"" not.
      - ""EGGSR"" not. Hard to find common words.

Now, try E in position 3: _ _ E _ _
  - Subcase 1: R in position 4: _ _ E R _
    - Then S can be in position 1, 2, or 5 (since not 3,4? S can be in 1,2,5, but position 4 is R, so S in 1,2,5.
    - If S in 1: S _ E R _
      - Then position 2 and 5: S [2] E R [5]
      - Words: ""SUERY"" not, ""SAPER"" (A absent), ""SEWER"" (E in 2? But we have E in 3, and ""SEWER"" is S-E-W-E-R -> E in 2 and 4, not 3.
      - ""SOLER"" (O absent) invalid.
      - ""SEDER"" (D, but E repeated) -> S-E-D-E-R, E in 2 and 4.
      - We need a word with E only in position 3. So [2] cannot be E.
      - Possible: ""SWER?"" not. ""SVER?"" not.
      - ""SKERF"" (K,F) -> S-K-E-R-F, which is S(1),K(2),E(3),R(4),F(5). This works, and avoids absent letters.
    - If S in 2: _ S E R _
      - Then position 1 and 5: [1] S E R [5]
      - Words: ""USER?"" not 5, ""ASPER"" (A absent), ""USHER"" (H absent) H is absent, ""OSIER"" (O,I absent).
      - ""MSERF"" not common.
      - ""PSERF"" not.
    - If S in 5: _ _ E R S
      - Then position 1 and 2: [1] [2] E R S
      - Words: ""BERSK"" not, ""VERSO"" (V,O) but O absent, ""FERSD"" not.
      - ""LERMS"" not.

  - Subcase 2: R in position 5: _ _ E _ R
    - Then S can be in position 1, 2, or 4.
    - If S in 1: S _ E _ R
      - Then position 2 and 4: S [2] E [4] R
      - Words: ""SUEDR"" not, ""SLEER"" (L,E repeated), ""SPEER"" not, ""SKEER"" not.
      - ""SWEIR"" not.
      - ""SEWER"" (E in 2 and 4? S-E-W-E-R -> E in 2 and 4, not 3.
      - We need E only in position 3. So [2] and [4] cannot be E.
      - Possible: ""SKEAR"" not, ""SPEAR"" (A absent), ""SMEAR"" (A absent), ""SWEAR"" (A absent).
      - ""SKERM"" not.
      - ""SCURR"" C absent.
    - If S in 2: _ S E _ R
      - Then position 1 and 4: [1] S E [4] R
      - Words: ""USER?"" not, ""OSIER"" O,I absent, ""ASPER"" A absent.
      - ""PSERD"" not.
      - ""MSERY"" not.
    - If S in 4: _ _ E S R
      - Then position 1 and 2: [1] [2] E S R
      - Words: ""MESR?"" not, ""YESR?"" not.
      - ""LESR?"" not.
      - ""PESKY"" is P-E-S-K-Y, but E in 2, not 3.

After exploring, one feasible word from above is ""SKERF"" for the case where E is in position 3 and R in position 4, with S in position 1. But ""SKERF"" is not very common.

Another possibility: E in position 3, R in position 5, and S in position 1: S _ E _ R
  - We need a word like S [2] E [4] R, with [2] and [4] not E, and not absent letters.
  - For example, ""SUPER"" (U,P) -> S-U-P-E-R, but E in 4, not 3.
  - ""SOWER"" (O,W) -> S-O-W-E-R, E in 4.
  - ""SEWER"" has E in 2 and 4.
  - ""SAFER"" A absent.
  - ""SEDGY"" D,G but not ending with R.

Perhaps ""SKERS"" not word.

Let's think of common words that fit the constraints.

We know:
- E in 1 or 3
- R in 4 or 5
- S in 1,2,4

But positions must be distinct.

Also, the word has two more letters.

Another idea: since R must be in 4 or 5, and E in 1 or 3, and S in 1,2,4, we can try to set S in position 2.

Then:
- If E in 1: E S _ _ _
  - R in 4 or 5: E S _ R _ or E S _ _ R
- If E in 3: _ S E _ _
  - R in 4 or 5: _ S E R _ or _ S E _ R

For E in 3 and S in 2: _ S E _ _
  - R in 4: _ S E R _
    - Then positions 1 and 5: [1] S E R [5]
    - Words: ""USER?"" not, ""ASPER"" A absent, ""USHER"" H absent, ""ISLER"" I absent.
    - ""PSERY"" not.
    - ""FSERY"" not.
  - R in 5: _ S E _ R
    - Then positions 1 and 4: [1] S E [4] R
    - Words: ""USER?"" not, ""OSIER"" O,I absent, ""ASPER"" A absent.
    - ""MSIER"" not.
    - ""WSIER"" not.

For E in 1 and S in 2: E S _ _ _
  - R in 4: E S _ R _
    - Positions 3 and 5: E S [3] R [5]
    - Words: ""ESPRY"", ""ESKER"", ""ESTER"" T absent.
    - ""ESKER"" is E-S-K-E-R -> but that has E in 1 and 4, but we have R in 4, so position 4 is R, not E. So it must be E-S-[3]-R-[5], so [3] cannot be E. ""ESKER"" has K in 3 and E in 4, but position 4 is R, so conflict.
    - ""ESPAD"" not.
    - ""ESTOP"" O absent and T absent.
  - R in 5: E S _ _ R
    - Positions 3 and 4: E S [3] [4] R
    - Words: ""ESPAR"" A absent, ""ESKAR"" not, ""ESDOR"" not.
    - ""ESPRY"" is E-S-P-R-Y? But that's 5 letters: E(1),S(2),P(3),R(4),Y(5) -> but we have R in 5? Here R is in 4, but we need R in 5. So not.
    - For R in 5, it should be E S [3] [4] R
    - ""ESKER"" is E-S-K-E-R -> positions: E(1),S(2),K(3),E(4),R(5) -> so [3] is K, [4] is E, but we have E in position 1 and 4, and R in 5. This fits the structure for R in 5. And it avoids absent letters except possibly the letters used.

""ESKER"" has E in position 1 and 4, which is allowed since E is present and can be duplicated. And K is new.

Similarly, we have another word: ""ESHER"" but H is absent.

Or ""ESPER"" P, but ""ESPER"" is E-S-P-E-R, same structure.

But ""ESPER"" is a valid word (a rare term for a kind of hope, or a surname).

But let's stick with ""ESKER"" or ""ESPER"".

But in ""ESKER"", K is less common, while in ""ESPER"", P is more common.

But we have to avoid O, which is absent, and ""ESPER"" doesn't have O.

Now, from the feedback of guess 3, we have S not in position 5, but in ""ESKER"", S is in position 2, which is allowed.

Also, E is in position 1 and 4, but we are guessing E in position 1 (which is allowed) and also in 4, but the constraint is that E must be in 1 or 3, and here it is in 1 and 4, so position 1 is covered, and position 4 is additional.

The constraint is that E must appear in position 1 or 3, but it can appear elsewhere too.

Similarly for R: in ""ESKER"", R is in position 5, which is allowed (R in 4 or 5).

S is in position 2, which is allowed (S in 1,2,4).

So ""ESKER"" is a valid guess.

Another common word: ""EVERR"" not.

Or ""EGGER"" G, but E in 1 and 4? ""EGGER"" is E-G-G-E-R, so E(1),G(2),G(3),E(4),R(5). This also fits: E in 1, R in 5, S not present? But we must have S. ""EGGER"" has no S, so invalid because S is present.

We must include S.

So ""ESKER"" has S in position 2.

Similarly, ""ESPED"" not a word.

So I think ""ESKER"" is a possible guess.

But let's see if there are better options.

Another possibility: E in position 3, R in position 5, and S in position 1.

So: S _ E _ R

Then positions 2 and 4: S [2] E [4] R

Words: ""SUEDR"" not, ""SLEER"" (L,E repeated), ""SWEER"" not, ""SPEER"" not, ""SKEER"" not.

""SUPER"" is S-U-P-E-R, but E in 4, not 3.

We need E in position 3, so [3] is E, so the word is S [2] E [4] R.

For example, ""SMEAR"" A absent.

""SWEAR"" A absent.

""SPEAR"" A absent.

""SKEGR"" not.

""SCURR"" C absent.

It's hard.

Perhaps ""SKEPR"" not a word.

So ""ESKER"" seems like a reasonable guess.

But in ""ESKER"", the letters are E, S, K, E, R. So it has two E's.

The feedback will tell us if there are two E's.

We can try ""ESPRY"" but it's not common.

Another word: ""ESKAR"" not valid.

So I'll go with ""ESKER"".

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can try a word with E in position 3 and R in position 4.

For example, with S in position 1: S _ E R _

Then positions 2 and 5: S [2] E R [5]

Words: ""SUERY"" not, ""SAFER"" A absent, ""SEDGY"" D,G -> S-E-D-G-Y? But E in 2, not 3.

We need E in position 3, so it should be S [2] E R [5], so [2] cannot be E.

For example, ""SKERY"" not common, or ""SPERY"" not.

""SKERF"" as I thought earlier: S-K-E-R-F, which is valid.

""SKERF"" is a word (a variant of scarf or a heraldry term), but it's obscure.

Perhaps ""UKASE"" but U and A, and E in 5.

Not.

Given the constraints, ""ESKER"" is more common than ""SKERF"".

So I'll choose ""ESKER"".

But in ""ESKER"", S is in position 2, which is allowed, and we are testing K.

If it's not the word, we get feedback.

So guess: ""ESKER""

But let's double-check the position constraints for E: E must be in 1 or 3. In ""ESKER"", E is in 1 and 4. Position 1 is E, so it satisfies the constraint that E is in position 1 or 3. The constraint doesn't say it can't be in other positions, only that it must be in 1 or 3 (which it is, in 1).

Similarly for R: in position 5, which is allowed (4 or 5).

S in position 2, which is allowed (1,2,4).

And it includes all three.

So it's valid.

Therefore, the guess is ""ESKER"".Based on the accumulated feedback:

- **Absent letters (x)**: C, A, T, I, N, H, O (eliminated).
- **Present letters (-)**: R, E, S (must be included, with specific position constraints).
- **Position constraints**:
  - R: Must be in position 4 or 5 (ruled out positions 1, 2, 3).
  - E: Must be in position 1 or 3 (ruled out positions 2, 4, 5).
  - S: Must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (ruled out positions 3, 5).

For the next guess:
- The word must include R, E, and S.
- It must exclude all absent letters (C, A, T, I, N, H, O).
- To adhere to position constraints and test new letters, the word **""ESKER""** is chosen because:
  - E is in position 1 (allowed).
  - S is in position 2 (allowed).
  - K is a new letter (position 3).
  - E is in position 4 (not constrained, as E can appear elsewhere if duplicated).
  - R is in position 5 (allowed).
- It is a valid English word (meaning a glacial ridge).

This guess tests the possibility of E duplication and the positions of R and S while introducing K.

<guess>esker</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (crate)**: 
     - C, A, T are absent (x).
     - R is present but not in position 2 (-).
     - E is present but not in position 5 (-).
   - **Guess 2 (risen)**:
     - R is present but not in position 1 (-).
     - I, N are absent (x).
     - S is present but not in position 3 (-).
     - E is present but not in position 4 (-).
   - **Guess 3 (heros)**:
     - H, O are absent (x).
     - E is present but not in position 2 (-).
     - R is present but not in position 3 (-).
     - S is present but not in position 5 (-).

2. **Deductions**:
   - **Absent Letters**: C, A, T, I, N, H, O (cannot appear in the word).
   - **Present Letters**: R, E, S (must appear at least once, with possible duplicates).
   - **Position Constraints**:
     - **R**: Cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from feedback). Must be in **position 4 or 5**.
     - **E**: Cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from feedback). Must be in **position 1 or 3**.
     - **S**: Cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from feedback). Must be in **position 1, 2, or 4**.
   - **Word Structure**: The word must include R, E, S and two new letters (not absent). With 3 guesses left, prioritize testing common unused letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y) and validating positions.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - **Address E Position**: E must be in position 1 or 3. Testing E in position 1 is efficient (covers one of the two options).
   - **Address R Position**: R must be in position 4 or 5. Pairing R in position 5 with E in position 1 avoids conflicts.
   - **Address S Position**: S must be in position 1, 2, or 4. With E in position 1, S can be in position 2 or 4 (position 1 is taken by E).
   - **Maximize Information**: Use a word with E in position 1, S in position 2, and R in position 5 to test these constraints. Include new common letters (e.g., K) for coverage.
   - **Word Selection**: ""ESKER"" fits:
     - E in position 1 (allowed).
     - S in position 2 (allowed).
     - K (new letter) in position 3.
     - E in position 4 (not constrained; possible duplicate).
     - R in position 5 (allowed).
   - **Why ""ESKER""?**:
     - Validates E in position 1 and R in position 5.
     - Tests S in position 2 and potential E duplication.
     - Introduces K (common unused letter).
     - Avoids all absent letters (C, A, T, I, N, H, O).
     - Is a valid English word (meaning a glacial ridge).

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If E in position 1 is correct, feedback will show ✓ for E.
   - If R in position 5 is correct, feedback will show ✓ for R.
   - Feedback on S (position 2) and K (position 3) will reveal if they are present/absent or in the right position.
   - Duplicate E (position 4) may provide additional clues.

Since it\'s the first turn and I have zero information, I need a strategic starting word. \n\nHmm... optimal first guesses usually prioritize common letters and vowel-consonant balance to maximize information gain. Words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" come to mind—they\'re popular among enthusiasts because they cover frequent letters and include vowels. \n\nBut wait, should I pick something that includes ""S""? Many plurals end with S, but since the word is exactly 5 letters, ending with S might be less likely. Alternatively, ""ADIEU"" focuses on vowels but leaves out common consonants. \n\nAfter some thought, ""CRATE"" feels balanced: it has two vowels (A,E) and three consonants (C,R,T) which all appear frequently in English. The letters C, R, A, T, and E give good coverage across different positions. Plus, none are overly rare—like Q or Z. \n\nThis choice should likely reveal several hits or misses, especially since E and T are among the most common letters. If I get feedback showing correct positions or existing letters elsewhere, future guesses will narrow down faster. \n\nI\'ll commit to ""CRATE"" for now—it\'s methodical enough to set up the next move efficiently.I\'m starting with ""CRATE"" because it\'s a balanced word containing common letters: \n- **C**, **R**, **T** are frequent consonants  \n- **A** and **E** are the most common vowels  \nThis maximizes the chance of revealing correct letters/positions early.\n\n<guess>crate</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""crate"":\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The letters C, A, T are not in the secret word at all.\n- The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position.\n- The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must contain R and E, and does not contain C, A, or T.\n\nWe have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.\n\nWe need to choose a new 5-letter word that:\n- Does not contain C, A, T (since they are absent)\n- Must include R and E (since they are present, but in different positions)\n- We also know that R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5.\n\nWe can use this information to form our next guess.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, T.\n\nAlso, note that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nPossible letters to consider: We have 26 letters, minus C, A, T, so 23 left. But we also know the word has R and E.\n\nWe should try to cover more common letters to get more information.\n\nCommon consonants besides R: S, L, N, etc. Common vowels: E (we already have), and then O, I, U.\n\nWe also know that R is in the word but not in position 2. So R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: the word is 5 letters.\n\nSimilarly, E is in the word but not in position 5, so E could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWe should avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5 in our next guess.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that have R and E, and also include other common letters we haven\'t tried yet, such as S, L, N, O, I, etc.\n\nSome candidate words:\n\n- ""robes"": but has S? Let\'s check: R in position 1 (which is allowed, since we don\'t know if R is in 1 or not), O, B, E, S. But we don\'t know about B and S. Also, E is in position 4 (not 5, so that\'s allowed). However, we don\'t know if O, B, S are in the word.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid A, C, T. ""robes"" doesn\'t have A, C, T. So it\'s a candidate.\n\nBut we might want to use a word that has more common letters to maximize information.\n\nAnother candidate: ""risen"" - R in position 1, I, S, E, N. E is in position 4. This avoids A, C, T.\n\nBut we know that in the first guess, R was in position 2 and was marked as wrong position. Now we are putting R in position 1. It might be that R is actually in position 1? Or it might be in 3,4,5. We don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to put R in a different position to test.\n\nBut note: we have two letters we know: R and E. We should try to place them in positions we haven\'t ruled out.\n\nWe also have three other positions to guess. We should try to use new common letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""reign"" - R in 1, E in 2, I, G, N. But E is in position 2? We don\'t know if E can be in position 2. The feedback only said E is not in position 5, so position 2 is allowed. Similarly, R in position 1 is allowed.\n\nBut we have to remember that R was originally in position 2 and was wrong. Now we are moving R to position 1. If the secret word has R in position 1, then we would get a check. If not, then we know R is in 3,4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, E was in position 5 and was wrong, now we put it in position 2. If it\'s correct, we get a check; if not, then we know it\'s in 3 or 4.\n\nBut we also want to test other letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""liner"" - L, I, N, E, R. But note: E is in position 4 and R in position 5. This avoids A, C, T. Also, we haven\'t tried L, I, N.\n\nBut we have to be cautious: if we put R in position 5, that might be a new position. Similarly, E in position 4.\n\nHowever, we know that E cannot be in position 5, but position 4 is allowed. And R cannot be in position 2, but position 5 is allowed.\n\nBut note: the word ""liner"" has R at the end. That might be a good test.\n\nBut let me think of more words.\n\nAnother common word: ""rouse"" - R in 1, O, U, S, E. E in position 5? Wait, we cannot put E in position 5 because we know E is not in position 5. So ""rouse"" has E in position 5 -> invalid because we know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5, so we can have E in other positions. But if we put E in position 5, we know it will be marked as wrong position (if the word has E) or absent? But we know E is present, so if we put it in position 5, it will be marked as \'-\' (wrong position) because we know it\'s not in position 5. But that doesn\'t give new information. So it\'s better to put E in a position that we haven\'t tried and that is allowed (1,2,3,4).\n\nSimilarly for R: avoid position 2.\n\nSo ""rouse"" is not ideal because E is in position 5.\n\nWe can try ""rodes"" or ""rides"", but we don\'t know about D or S.\n\nAnother idea: ""resin"" - R in 1, E in 2, S, I, N. This has E in position 2 and R in position 1. It avoids A, C, T.\n\nBut we might also consider ""rinse"" - R in 1, I, N, S, E. E in position 5? Again, we know E is not in position 5, so we avoid that.\n\nSo ""rinse"" is not good because of E at the end.\n\nSimilarly, ""risen"" has E in position 4: R(1), I(2), S(3), E(4), N(5). That seems okay.\n\nBut in ""risen"", R is in position 1 and E in position 4.\n\nWe also have the letter I, S, N to test.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that puts R in a different position, say position 3 or 4.\n\nFor example, ""beryl"" - B, E, R, Y, L. But we don\'t know about B, Y, L. And E is in position 2, R in position 3.\n\nThis avoids A, C, T.\n\nBut ""beryl"" is a less common word? We should stick to common words.\n\nAnother common word: ""peril"" - P, E, R, I, L. E in position 2, R in position 3. Avoids A, C, T.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested P, I, L.\n\nWe could also try ""urged"" - U, R, G, E, D. But U and G and D are less common? And E is in position 4, R in position 2? Wait, we cannot put R in position 2 because we know R is not in position 2. So ""urged"" has R in position 2 -> that would be invalid because we know R is not in position 2. So we must avoid putting R in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid E in position 5.\n\nSo in our next guess, R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.\n\nLet me list some words that have R and E, and avoid A, C, T, and with R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""robed"": R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), D(5) -> but E is in position 4? Wait, position 4 is allowed. But we have D at the end? And we don\'t know about O, B, D.\n\n- ""robes"": as I thought earlier: R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), S(5). E is in position 4, which is allowed. R in position 1, which is allowed. We test O, B, S.\n\n- ""ropes"": R(1), O(2), P(3), E(4), S(5). Similar.\n\n- ""rides"": R(1), I(2), D(3), E(4), S(5). But R is in position 1, E in position 4. We test I, D, S.\n\n- ""riles"": R(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). Same.\n\nBut note: in all these, we are putting R in position 1. What if R is not in position 1? Then we will get a \'-\' for R, and we know it must be in 3,4, or 5.\n\nAlternatively, we can put R in position 3 or 4 to test other possibilities.\n\nFor example, ""wired"": W(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). But E is in position 4, which is allowed. R is in position 3, which is allowed. We test W, I, D.\n\nBut W is not very common.\n\n""fired"": F(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). Same.\n\n""hired"": H(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), D(5).\n\nBut we might get more information if we use more common letters.\n\nAnother idea: since we have two letters to place (R and E) and three new letters, we should choose common letters for the other positions.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: S, L, N, O, I, D, etc.\n\nWe also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and must be valid.\n\nI think ""risen"" is a good candidate: R in 1, I in 2, S in 3, E in 4, N in 5. This tests R in position 1, E in position 4, and also tests I, S, N.\n\nBut note: we know that E is not in position 5, but in ""risen"", E is in position 4, which is fine. And R is in position 1, which is not the second position (which we know is wrong for R).\n\nAlternatively, ""robin"" but ""robin"" doesn\'t have E? We know the word must have E, so we must include E.\n\nSo we must have both R and E.\n\nAnother word: ""reign"" - R(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5). This has E in position 2, which is allowed. And R in position 1. We test I, G, N.\n\nBut we don\'t know if E can be in position 2. It might be, or it might not.\n\nSimilarly, we can try ""reins"" - R(1), E(2), I(3), N(4), S(5). But E is in position 2 and we have S at the end. But note: we know E is not in position 5, but in this word, E is in position 2, so that\'s allowed.\n\nBut in ""reins"", we have E in position 2. If the secret word has E in position 2, we get a check. If not, we get a \'-\'.\n\nBut we also have R in position 1.\n\nI think either ""risen"" or ""reign"" or ""ropes"" are fine.\n\nBut let me consider the feedback we got: in the first guess, R was in position 2 and was marked as wrong position. That means R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 1, and if it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know R must be in position 3,4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly for E: it was in position 5 and was wrong, so if we put E in position 4 (like in ""risen"") and it is correct, we get a check; if not, we get a \'-\' and then we know E must be in position 1,2, or 3.\n\nSo to maximize information, we might want to test R in a new position and E in a new position.\n\nBut we have limited tries.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has R and E and also includes other common letters that we haven\'t eliminated.\n\nI think ""ropes"" is a good choice: R in 1, O in 2, P in 3, E in 4, S in 5. We test O, P, S, and also the positions for R and E.\n\nBut note: we know that the secret word does not have A, C, T, so we are safe.\n\nAnother common word: ""lives"" but that has V and S, and no R? We must include R and E.\n\n""liver"" - L, I, V, E, R. This has E in position 4 and R in position 5. So E is in position 4 (allowed) and R in position 5 (allowed, since we only know it\'s not in position 2). We test L, I, V.\n\nBut V is less common.\n\nI think ""ropes"" is better.\n\nBut let me check if ""ropes"" is valid: yes.\n\nWe could also use ""roses"", but that has S twice? And we don\'t know about S. But ""roses"" has R in 1, O in 2, S in 3, E in 4, S in 5. But we have two S\'s. It might be okay, but we don\'t know if the word has S.\n\nBut we are trying to test multiple letters.\n\nTo avoid duplication, ""ropes"" has unique letters: R, O, P, E, S. That\'s good.\n\nSimilarly, ""risen"" has R, I, S, E, N.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""risen"" because it includes I, S, N which are common.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was absent, so we avoid A. But we haven\'t tested I, S, N.\n\nSo ""risen"" seems good.\n\nBut let me see: we have R in position 1 (which might be correct or not), and E in position 4.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nAnother word: ""renew"" but that has W and two E\'s? Not ideal.\n\nI think ""risen"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut wait, we know that the secret word has R and E, and we are putting R in 1 and E in 4. If the secret word has R in 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus. Similarly for E.\n\nAlso, we test I in position 2, S in position 3, N in position 5.\n\nWe know that position 2 was R in the first guess and was wrong, but now we are putting I there. It might be correct or not.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""risen"".\n\nBut let me confirm: the word ""risen"" is valid.\n\nSo my next guess is ""risen"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":\n- C, A, T are **absent** from the secret word.\n- R is **present** but not in position 2.\n- E is **present** but not in position 5.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include **R** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).\n- It must **exclude** C, A, T (since they are absent).\n- R cannot be placed in position 2 (as per feedback).\n- E cannot be placed in position 5 (as per feedback).\n- To maximize information, the guess should test new common letters (e.g., S, I, N) and place R and E in positions not yet ruled out (e.g., R in position 1 or 3–5; E in positions 1–4).\n\nThe word **""risen""** is chosen because:\n- It includes R (position 1) and E (position 4), both in allowed positions.\n- It tests new common letters: I (position 2), S (position 3), and N (position 5).\n- It avoids C, A, T.\n- It is a valid English word.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of R and E while providing information on I, S, and N.\n\n<guess>risen</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: risen -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) S(-) E(-) N(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crate""\n- C: absent (x)\n- R: present, but not in position 2 (-)\n- A: absent (x)\n- T: absent (x)\n- E: present, but not in position 5 (-)\n\nGuess 2: ""risen""\n- R: present, but not in position 1 (-) [since it was in position 1 and marked as wrong position]\n- I: absent (x)\n- S: present, but not in position 3 (-)\n- E: present, but not in position 4 (-) [now we know E is not in position 4 or 5]\n- N: absent (x)\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n\n1. **Confirmed absent letters:** C, A, T, I, N\n2. **Confirmed present letters:** R, E, S (since they were marked present in at least one guess)\n3. **Position constraints:**\n   - R: Not in position 2 (from guess 1) and not in position 1 (from guess 2). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n   - E: Not in position 5 (from guess 1) and not in position 4 (from guess 2). So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n   - S: Not in position 3 (from guess 2).

But S can be in 2, and E in 1 is allowed.\n- Then R in 3,4, or 5.\n\nBut we need two more letters.\n\nAlternatively, place E in position 2, then R in 3,4,5 and S in 1,4,5.\n\nLet\'s list possible words:\n\nTry E in position 1:\n- E _ _ _ _\n  - Then we can have S in position 2: E S _ _ _\n    - Then R in 3,4,5: e.g., E S R _ _ (but R in 3) -> but we need two more letters, and avoid absent letters.\n    - Words: ""ESPRY"" (but Y is less common, and we don\'t know if P is present) or ""ESKER"" (but K and E again? and we have E already, but it\'s allowed if the word has two E\'s? But we don\'t know if E is repeated. However, in feedback, E was only marked present once, but it could be repeated? The feedback doesn\'t indicate duplicates. So we have to consider that possibility. But to be safe, let\'s avoid assuming duplicates for now.\n\nBut we need to use common words.\n\nAnother idea: Place E in position 3, then R in 3? But E and R both in position 3? No, only one letter per position.\n\nE in position 3 and R in position 4 or 5? That could work.\n\nFor example: _ _ E R _ \n\nBut S must be in 1,2,4,5. If we put R in 4, then S cannot be in 4, so S in 1,2,5.\n\nSimilarly, if E is in 3, then we have positions 1,2 for other letters and 5 for S or R.\n\nLet me try to form words.\n\nWe know the word must have R, E, S and two more letters (not C,A,T,I,N).\n\nCommon letters: O, L, D, U, etc.\n\nTry a word with E in position 2? That might be promising.\n\nFor example: _ E _ _ _\n\nThen R in 3,4,5 and S in 1,4,5.\n\nIf we put S in position 1: S E _ _ _\n\nThen R in 3,4,5: e.g., S E R _ _ (R in 3) -> ""SERUM"" (but U and M, and we don\'t know) or ""SERIF"" (F) or ""SEROW"" (O and W).\n\nBut we have to avoid I (absent) so ""SERIF"" has I? No, I is absent, so we cannot use I. ""SERIF"" has I? S-E-R-I-F -> I is the fourth letter, but we know I is absent, so invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""SERUM"" has U and M, which are not tested.\n\nAnother possibility: S in position 1, E in position 2, and R in position 5: S E _ _ R\n\nThen the word must have another letter in position 3 and 4, and we have S, E, and R already, but the word must have 5 distinct? Not necessarily, but we don\'t know.\n\nWords: ""SEWER"" (but E is repeated, and W) or ""SEPIA"" (but A is absent) or ""SEDGE"" (E repeated, D, G).\n\nBut we avoid A, so ""SEPIA"" is out.\n\n""SEWER"" has E twice, which is possible.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can avoid duplicates for now.\n\nPlace E in position 3.\n\nSo: _ _ E _ _\n\nThen R in 3,4,5 -> but position 3 is taken by E, so R in 4 or 5.\n\nS in 1,2,4,5.\n\nCase 1: R in 4: _ _ E R _\n  - Then S in 1,2,5: \n    - If S in 1: S _ E R _\n    - If S in 2: _ S E R _\n    - If S in 5: _ _ E R S\n\nCase 2: R in 5: _ _ E _ R\n  - Then S in 1,2,4: \n    - S in 1: S _ E _ R\n    - S in 2: _ S E _ R\n    - S in 4: _ _ E S R\n\nNow, we need to fill the remaining positions with letters not in {C,A,T,I,N} and common.\n\nLet\'s try to form words:\n\nFor S in 1 and R in 4: S _ E R _\n  - Words: ""SOWER"" (O, W, E) -> but E is in position 3, and we have E already? The word has E at 3 and R at 4. ""SOWER"" is S-O-W-E-R -> positions: S(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5) -> but we have E in position 4? But we placed E in position 3, so this doesn\'t match.\n\nWe have fixed E in position 3, so for case 1 (R in 4): the word is _ _ E R _ , so positions: 1,2, E, R, 5.\n\nSo for S in 1: S _ E R _ -> we need a letter for position 2 and 5.\n\nWords: ""SUER?"" but not 5 letters. ""SOLER"" (O, L) -> S-O-L-E-R? But that\'s S(1),O(2),L(3),E(4),R(5) -> but we have E in position 4, but we wanted E in position 3? I think I confused.\n\nIf we set E in position 3 and R in position 4, then the word is: [1] [2] E R [5]\n\nSo for example, if S is in position 1: S [2] E R [5]\n\nWe need letters for position 2 and 5, not C,A,T,I,N.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""SUERS"" (but S repeated and not common) \n- ""SAYER"" (but A is absent) \n- ""SOBER"" (O, B) -> S-O-B-E-R -> S(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), R(5) -> but we have E in position 4, but we set E to be in position 3? This has E in 4, not 3.\n\nI think I made a mistake: if E is in position 3, then position 3 is E. Then R in position 4, so position 4 is R. Then position 1,2,5 to fill.\n\nSo the word is: [1] [2] E R [5]\n\nWe cannot have a letter in position 3 because it\'s E, and position 4 is R.\n\nSo the word has five positions: 1,2,3=E,4=R,5.\n\nSo for example, ""POWER"" is P-O-W-E-R, which is P(1),O(2),W(3),E(4),R(5) -> but that has E in 4, not 3.\n\nWe need a word with E in position 3 and R in position 4.\n\nFor example: ""LOWER"" is L-O-W-E-R -> E in 4, not 3.\n\n""BOXER"" is B-O-X-E-R -> same.\n\n""DEFER"" is D-E-F-E-R -> E in 2 and 4.\n\nWe need a word with the third letter E and fourth letter R.\n\nExamples: ""RULER"" is R-U-L-E-R -> E in 4.\n\n""TIGER"" is T-I-G-E-R -> E in 4.\n\nI\'m struggling. Let me think: ""ORDER"" is O-R-D-E-R -> E in 4.\n\n""OFFER"" is O-F-F-E-R -> E in 4.\n\nWhat about ""OAKER""? Not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""EYERS"" or something, but not common.\n\nAnother idea: ""LEVER"" is L-E-V-E-R -> E in 2 and 4.\n\nWe need a word with E in position 3.\n\nFor example: ""AXLED"" but not common.\n\nPerhaps I should consider other placements.\n\nLet\'s try E in position 1.\n\nSo: E _ _ _ _\n\nThen R in 3,4,5.\n\nS in 2,4,5 (since not 3).\n\nIf S in 2: E S _ _ _\n\nThen R in 3,4,5.\n\nIf R in 3: E S R _ _ -> ""ESPRY"" (not common) or ""ESTRO"" (not word) or ""ESKER"" (which is a word, meaning a glacial ridge).\n\n""ESKER"" has E(1), S(2), K(3), E(4), R(5) -> but E is repeated, and we have E in position 1 and 4. But we know E is present, and it could be repeated. Also, K is new.\n\nBut let\'s see feedback: in guess 1, E was present but not in 5, and in guess 2, E was present but not in 4. So if the word has two E\'s, it\'s possible.\n\nBut we can try.\n\nAnother word: E in 1, S in 5, and R in 3: E _ R _ S\n\nWords: ""EARLS"" (but A is absent) or ""EERKS"" not word.\n\n""EURES"" not common.\n\nPlace E in position 2.\n\nSo: _ E _ _ _\n\nThen R in 3,4,5.\n\nS in 1,4,5.\n\nIf S in 1: S E _ _ _\n\nThen R in 3,4,5.\n\nIf R in 3: S E R _ _ -> ""SERGE"" (G) or ""SERFS"" (F) or ""SEROW"" (O,W)\n\nIf R in 4: S E _ R _ -> ""SEORA"" (A absent) or ""SEPIA"" (A absent) or ""SEDGY"" (D,G,Y) or ""SEDGE"" (D,G,E repeated)\n\nIf R in 5: S E _ _ R -> ""SEWER"" (W,E repeated) or ""SEIZR"" not word.\n\nNow, with S in 1, E in 2, R in 5: ""SEWER"" is a word, but has E repeated.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates if possible.\n\nAnother option: S in 4 or 5.\n\nFor example, with E in 2, and S in 4: _ E _ S _\n\nThen R in 3,4,5 -> but S is in 4, so R cannot be in 4, so R in 3 or 5.\n\nIf R in 3: _ E R S _ -> ""BERSK"" not word or ""VERSO"" (V,O) or ""PERSU"" not common.\n\nIf R in 5: _ E _ S R -> ""MESER"" not common or ""YESES"" S repeated.\n\nWith E in 2, S in 5: _ E _ _ S\n\nThen R in 3,4,5 -> but S is in 5, so R in 3 or 4.\n\nIf R in 3: _ E R _ S -> ""HEROS"" (H,O) or ""ZEROS"" (Z,O) or ""FERNS"" (F, but N absent) N is absent, so ""FERNS"" has N, which is absent, invalid.\n\n""HEROS"" is H-E-R-O-S, which is valid, and H, O are new.\n\nSimilarly, ""DEROS"" not common.\n\nSo ""HEROS"" is a possibility.\n\nBut we have to check if it meets: E in position 2, R in position 3, S in position 5. And H in 1, O in 4.\n\nLetters: H, E, R, O, S. All not in absent list.\n\nSimilarly, another word: ""ZEROS"" but Z is less common.\n\nOr ""MERES"" but E repeated and S at the end, but ""MERES"" is M-E-R-E-S, so E in 2 and 4, R in 3, S in 5.\n\nBut E repeated.\n\nTo avoid duplication, ""HEROS"" is better.\n\nBut ""HEROS"" is a valid word (plural of hero).\n\nAnother option: E in position 3.\n\nLet\'s find a word with E in position 3 and R in position 5, for example.\n\nSo: _ _ E _ R\n\nThen S in 1,2,4.\n\nIf S in 1: S _ E _ R -> ""SKEER"" not common or ""SPEER"" not or ""SUPER"" (U,P) -> S-U-P-E-R, which is S(1),U(2),P(3),E(4),R(5) -> but we have E in position 4, not 3.\n\nWe need E in position 3.\n\nSo for ""SUPER"", E is in 4.\n\nWhat word has E in position 3 and R in position 5? ""LATER"" is L-A-T-E-R, but A and T absent.\n\n""PIPER"" is P-I-P-E-R, I absent.\n\n""BOXER"" B-O-X-E-R, E in 4.\n\n""MAKER"" M-A-K-E-R, A absent.\n\n""USER"" U-S-E-R, but 4 letters.\n\n""BASER"" B-A-S-E-R, A absent.\n\nIt\'s hard. ""OAKER"" not word.\n\nPerhaps ""OGEED"" not word.\n\nAnother idea: ""EYRES"" E-Y-R-E-S, but E in 1 and 4.\n\nI think it\'s difficult to find with E in 3 and R in 5.\n\nPerhaps R in 4 with E in 3: we had the structure [1] [2] E R [5]\n\nWords: ""UMPER"" not word.\n\n""UMBER"" U-M-B-E-R -> but E in 4.\n\n""AMBER"" A absent.\n\n""EMBER"" E-M-B-E-R -> E in 1 and 4, not 3.\n\nI think we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters, or try a different approach.\n\nLet\'s list all possible positions for the known letters.\n\nR: positions 3,4,5\nE: positions 1,2,3\nS: positions 1,2,4,5\n\nWe need to assign positions that are compatible.\n\nFor example:\n- If E is in 1, then S can be in 2,4,5 and R in 3,4,5.\n- If E is in 2, then S in 1,4,5 and R in 3,4,5.\n- If E is in 3, then S in 1,2,4,5 and R in 4,5 (since R cannot be in 3 if E is there).\n\nAlso, the positions must be distinct.\n\nNow, let\'s try to find words that fit.\n\nStart with E in position 1: E _ _ _ _\n  - S could be in 2: E S _ _ _\n    - R in 3: E S R _ _ -> ""ESPRY"", ""ESKER"", ""ESTER"" (but T absent) T is absent, so ""ESTER"" invalid. ""ESKER"" is valid.\n  - S in 4: E _ _ S _\n    - R in 3: E _ R S _ -> ""EERSS"" not word or ""EORLS"" not.\n    - R in 5: E _ _ S R -> ""EAUSR"" not or ""EMMES"" not.\n  - S in 5: E _ _ _ S\n    - R in 3: E _ R _ S -> ""EARLS"" A absent, ""EERKS"" not, ""EORDS"" not.\n    - R in 4: E _ _ R S -> ""EURES"" not common, ""EILRS"" I absent.\n\nSo only ""ESKER"" seems possible for E in 1 and S in 2 and R in 3.\n\nBut ""ESKER"" has K, which is new.\n\nNow, E in position 2: _ E _ _ _\n  - S in 1: S E _ _ _\n    - R in 3: S E R _ _ -> ""SERGE"", ""SERFS"", ""SEROW"", ""SERED"" (D)\n    - R in 4: S E _ R _ -> ""SEDER"" (D, but E repeated) or ""SEGAR"" (G, but A absent) or ""SEWAR"" not common.\n    - R in 5: S E _ _ R -> ""SEWER"" (W, E repeated), ""SEGGR"" not.\n  - S in 4: _ E _ S _\n    - R in 3: _ E R S _ -> ""VERSO"" (V,O), ""PERPS"" not, ""HERSE"" (H,E repeated)\n    - R in 5: _ E _ S R -> ""MESYR"" not or ""FESOR"" not.\n  - S in 5: _ E _ _ S\n    - R in 3: _ E R _ S -> ""HEROS"" (H,O), ""DERMS"" (D,M), ""FERNS"" (F,N absent) invalid, ""PERPS"" not.\n    - R in 4: _ E _ R S -> ""AEROS"" A absent, ""EERKS"" not, ""LORES"" L,O -> ""LORES"" is L-O-R-E-S, which is L(1),O(2),R(3),E(4),S(5) -> but we have E in position 4, not 2. We need E in position 2.\n\nFor ""HEROS"": it is H-E-R-O-S, so H(1), E(2), R(3), O(4), S(5). This fits: E in 2, R in 3, S in 5. And O in 4 and H in 1 are new.\n\nAnd it avoids absent letters: C,A,T,I,N are absent, and H,O are not in that list.\n\nSimilarly, ""DERMS"" is D-E-R-M-S, which is also valid, but M is less common than O.\n\n""HEROS"" is a good choice.\n\nNow, E in position 3: _ _ E _ _\n  - S in 1: S _ E _ _\n    - R in 4: S _ E R _ -> ""SUPER"" U,P but E in 4? No, we need E in 3. ""SUPER"" is S-U-P-E-R, E in 4.\n      We need a word like S ? E R ? with E in 3 and R in 4.\n      ""SAYER"" A absent.\n      ""SOBER"" O,B -> S-O-B-E-R, but E in 4.\n      I can\'t find one.\n    - R in 5: S _ E _ R -> ""SKEER"" not, ""SPEER"" not, ""SUPER"" E in 4.\n  - S in 2: _ S E _ _\n    - R in 4: _ S E R _ -> ""ASPER"" A absent, ""USHER"" U,H -> U-S-H-E-R, E in 4.\n      ""RS."" not.\n    - R in 5: _ S E _ R -> ""OSIER"" O,I absent (I is absent), ""USHER"" E in 4.\n  - S in 4: _ _ E S _\n    - R in 5: _ _ E S R -> ""MESER"" not, ""YESER"" not.\n  - S in 5: _ _ E _ S\n    - R in 4: _ _ E R S -> ""BERSK"" not, ""VERSO"" V,O -> V-E-R-S-O, which is V(1),E(2),R(3),S(4),O(5) -> but we have E in position 2, not 3. We need E in 3.\n\nSo for E in position 3, it\'s hard to find a common word.\n\nTherefore, the best options are ""ESKER"" or ""HEROS"".\n\n""HEROS"" seems more common than ""ESKER"".\n\nAlso, ""HEROS"" tests H and O, which are common.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""HEROS"".\n\nIn ""HEROS"":\n- H is new\n- E in position 2 (allowed)\n- R in position 3 (allowed, since R can be in 3,4,5 and not 1 or 2)\n- O in position 4\n- S in position 5 (allowed, since S not in 3)\n\nAnd it meets all constraints.\n\nSo the guess is ""HEROS"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Absent letters (x)**: C, A, T, I, N (eliminated from consideration).\n- **Present letters (-)**: R, E, S (must be included, but in different positions).\n- **Position constraints**:\n  - R: Not in position 1 (from ""risen"") or 2 (from ""crate""), so must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n  - E: Not in position 4 (from ""risen"") or 5 (from ""crate""), so must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n  - S: Not in position 3 (from ""risen""), so must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must include R, E, and S.\n- It must exclude C, A, T, I, N.\n- To maximize information, the guess should test new common letters (e.g., H, O) and adhere to the position constraints for R, E, and S.\n\nThe word **""HEROS""** is chosen because:\n- It includes R (position 3), E (position 2), and S (position 5), all in allowed positions.\n- It tests new common letters: H (position 1) and O (position 4).\n- It avoids all absent letters.\n- It is a valid English word (plural of ""hero"").\n\nThis guess will help confirm the positions of R, E, and S while providing information on H and O.\n\n<guess>heros</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: risen -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) S(-) E(-) N(x)\nGuess 3: heros -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(-) R(-) O(x) S(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crate""\n- C: absent (x)\n- R: present, not in position 2 (-)\n- A: absent (x)\n- T: absent (x)\n- E: present, not in position 5 (-)\n\nGuess 2: ""risen""\n- R: present, not in position 1 (-)\n- I: absent (x)\n- S: present, not in position 3 (-)\n- E: present, not in position 4 (-)\n- N: absent (x)\n\nGuess 3: ""heros""\n- H: absent (x)\n- E: present, not in position 2 (-)\n- R: present, not in position 3 (-)\n- O: absent (x)\n- S: present, not in position 5 (-)\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n\n1. **Confirmed absent letters:** C, A, T, I, N, H, O\n2. **Confirmed present letters:** R, E, S (they appeared as present in all three guesses)\n3. **Position constraints:**\n   - R: \n     - Not in position 2 (from ""crate"")\n     - Not in position 1 (from ""risen"")\n     - Not in position 3 (from ""heros"")\n     - Therefore, R must be in position 4 or 5 (since only positions 4 and 5 are left).\n   - E:\n     - Not in position 5 (from ""crate"")\n     - Not in position 4 (from ""risen"")\n     - Not in position 2 (from ""heros"")\n     - Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 3 (positions 1 and 3 are the only ones not ruled out).\n   - S:\n     - Not in position 3 (from ""risen"")\n     - Not in position 5 (from ""heros"")\n     - Therefore, S must be in position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nAdditionally, the secret word must contain R, E, and S, and two more letters (since it\'s a 5-letter word). The absent letters are C, A, T, I, N, H, O, so the remaining possible letters are: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe have 3 guesses left.\n\nWe need to choose a word that:\n- Includes R, E, S\n- Excludes C, A, T, I, N, H, O\n- Places R in position 4 or 5\n- Places E in position 1 or 3\n- Places S in position 1, 2, or 4 (but note: positions must be distinct)\n\nAlso, we need to test the remaining two letters.\n\nLet\'s consider the possibilities for E and R:\n\nCase 1: E in position 1\n- Then the word is: E _ _ _ _\n- R must be in position 4 or 5: E _ _ R _ or E _ _ _ R\n- S must be in position 2 or 4 (since not 1 if E is there, and not 3 or 5? But S can be in 4, and if R is in 4, conflict. So if E is in 1, then S can be in 2 or 4, but if R is in 4, then S cannot be in 4, so S must be in 2. If R is in 5, then S can be in 2 or 4.\n\nCase 2: E in position 3\n- Then the word is: _ _ E _ _\n- R must be in position 4 or 5: _ _ E R _ or _ _ E _ R\n- S must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But if R is in 4, then S cannot be in 4, so S in 1,2. If R is in 5, then S in 1,2,4.\n\nWe should also try to cover common letters for the unknown positions.\n\nGiven the constraints, let\'s try to form words.\n\nFirst, try E in position 1: E _ _ _ _\n  - Subcase 1: R in position 4: E _ _ R _\n    - Then S must be in position 2 (since position 4 is taken by R, and S cannot be in 3 or 5? S can be in 2, and we have positions 3 and 5 for other letters.\n    - So: E S _ R _? But S in position 2: E S _ R _\n    - We need letters for position 3 and 5, not absent.\n    - Possible words: ""ESKER"" (but K and E? and we have E already, but ""ESKER"" is E-S-K-E-R -> but that has E in 1 and 4, but here R is in 4? Conflict. In this structure, we have R in 4, so the fourth letter is R, not E.\n    - So: E S [3] R [5]\n    - Words: ""ESPRY"" (P, Y) or ""ESTRY"" (T absent) or ""ESBOR"" not a word.\n    - ""ESPRY"" is not common. ""ESBOD"" not.\n    - Hard to find.\n\n  - Subcase 2: R in position 5: E _ _ _ R\n    - Then S can be in position 2 or 4.\n    - If S in 2: E S _ _ R\n      - Then positions 3 and 4 to fill: E S [3] [4] R\n      - Words: ""ESPUR"" not, ""ESKAR"" not, ""ESDOR"" not.\n      - ""ESTER"" (T absent) invalid.\n      - ""ESKER"" is E-S-K-E-R -> but that has E in 1 and 4, and R in 5. But in this, position 4 is E, not a new letter? And we have E repeated. But it\'s a word. However, we have E in position 1 and 4, but we know E is present, so it could be. But in feedback, E was always marked present, but we don\'t know if duplicated. But we can try.\n      - ""ESKER"" has K in position 3.\n    - If S in 4: E _ _ S R\n      - Then positions 2 and 3: E [2] [3] S R\n      - Words: ""EUSSR"" not, ""EMMSR"" not, ""EDGSR"" not.\n      - ""EGGSR"" not. Hard to find common words.\n\nNow, try E in position 3: _ _ E _ _\n  - Subcase 1: R in position 4: _ _ E R _\n    - Then S can be in position 1, 2, or 5 (since not 3,4? S can be in 1,2,5, but position 4 is R, so S in 1,2,5.\n    - If S in 1: S _ E R _\n      - Then position 2 and 5: S [2] E R [5]\n      - Words: ""SUERY"" not, ""SAPER"" (A absent), ""SEWER"" (E in 2?

But ""SKERF"" is not very common.\n\nAnother possibility: E in position 3, R in position 5, and S in position 1: S _ E _ R\n  - We need a word like S [2] E [4] R, with [2] and [4] not E, and not absent letters.\n  - For example, ""SUPER"" (U,P) -> S-U-P-E-R, but E in 4, not 3.\n  - ""SOWER"" (O,W) -> S-O-W-E-R, E in 4.\n  - ""SEWER"" has E in 2 and 4.\n  - ""SAFER"" A absent.\n  - ""SEDGY"" D,G but not ending with R.\n\nPerhaps ""SKERS"" not word.\n\nLet\'s think of common words that fit the constraints.\n\nWe know:\n- E in 1 or 3\n- R in 4 or 5\n- S in 1,2,4\n\nBut positions must be distinct.\n\nAlso, the word has two more letters.\n\nAnother idea: since R must be in 4 or 5, and E in 1 or 3, and S in 1,2,4, we can try to set S in position 2.\n\nThen:\n- If E in 1: E S _ _ _\n  - R in 4 or 5: E S _ R _ or E S _ _ R\n- If E in 3: _ S E _ _\n  - R in 4 or 5: _ S E R _ or _ S E _ R\n\nFor E in 3 and S in 2: _ S E _ _\n  - R in 4: _ S E R _\n    - Then positions 1 and 5: [1] S E R [5]\n    - Words: ""USER?"" not, ""ASPER"" A absent, ""USHER"" H absent, ""ISLER"" I absent.\n    - ""PSERY"" not.\n    - ""FSERY"" not.\n  - R in 5: _ S E _ R\n    - Then positions 1 and 4: [1] S E [4] R\n    - Words: ""USER?"" not, ""OSIER"" O,I absent, ""ASPER"" A absent.\n    - ""MSIER"" not.\n    - ""WSIER"" not.\n\nFor E in 1 and S in 2: E S _ _ _\n  - R in 4: E S _ R _\n    - Positions 3 and 5: E S [3] R [5]\n    - Words: ""ESPRY"", ""ESKER"", ""ESTER"" T absent.\n    - ""ESKER"" is E-S-K-E-R -> but that has E in 1 and 4, but we have R in 4, so position 4 is R, not E.

So not.\n    - For R in 5, it should be E S [3] [4] R\n    - ""ESKER"" is E-S-K-E-R -> positions: E(1),S(2),K(3),E(4),R(5) -> so [3] is K, [4] is E, but we have E in position 1 and 4, and R in 5. This fits the structure for R in 5. And it avoids absent letters except possibly the letters used.\n\n""ESKER"" has E in position 1 and 4, which is allowed since E is present and can be duplicated. And K is new.\n\nSimilarly, we have another word: ""ESHER"" but H is absent.\n\nOr ""ESPER"" P, but ""ESPER"" is E-S-P-E-R, same structure.\n\nBut ""ESPER"" is a valid word (a rare term for a kind of hope, or a surname).\n\nBut let\'s stick with ""ESKER"" or ""ESPER"".\n\nBut in ""ESKER"", K is less common, while in ""ESPER"", P is more common.\n\nBut we have to avoid O, which is absent, and ""ESPER"" doesn\'t have O.\n\nNow, from the feedback of guess 3, we have S not in position 5, but in ""ESKER"", S is in position 2, which is allowed.\n\nAlso, E is in position 1 and 4, but we are guessing E in position 1 (which is allowed) and also in 4, but the constraint is that E must be in 1 or 3, and here it is in 1 and 4, so position 1 is covered, and position 4 is additional.\n\nThe constraint is that E must appear in position 1 or 3, but it can appear elsewhere too.\n\nSimilarly for R: in ""ESKER"", R is in position 5, which is allowed (R in 4 or 5).\n\nS is in position 2, which is allowed (S in 1,2,4).\n\nSo ""ESKER"" is a valid guess.\n\nAnother common word: ""EVERR"" not.\n\nOr ""EGGER"" G, but E in 1 and 4? ""EGGER"" is E-G-G-E-R, so E(1),G(2),G(3),E(4),R(5). This also fits: E in 1, R in 5, S not present? But we must have S. ""EGGER"" has no S, so invalid because S is present.\n\nWe must include S.\n\nSo ""ESKER"" has S in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""ESPED"" not a word.\n\nSo I think ""ESKER"" is a possible guess.\n\nBut let\'s see if there are better options.\n\nAnother possibility: E in position 3, R in position 5, and S in position 1.\n\nSo: S _ E _ R\n\nThen positions 2 and 4: S [2] E [4] R\n\nWords: ""SUEDR"" not, ""SLEER"" (L,E repeated), ""SWEER"" not, ""SPEER"" not, ""SKEER"" not.\n\n""SUPER"" is S-U-P-E-R, but E in 4, not 3.\n\nWe need E in position 3, so [3] is E, so the word is S [2] E [4] R.\n\nFor example, ""SMEAR"" A absent.\n\n""SWEAR"" A absent.\n\n""SPEAR"" A absent.\n\n""SKEGR"" not.\n\n""SCURR"" C absent.\n\nIt\'s hard.\n\nPerhaps ""SKEPR"" not a word.\n\nSo ""ESKER"" seems like a reasonable guess.\n\nBut in ""ESKER"", the letters are E, S, K, E, R. So it has two E\'s.\n\nThe feedback will tell us if there are two E\'s.\n\nWe can try ""ESPRY"" but it\'s not common.\n\nAnother word: ""ESKAR"" not valid.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""ESKER"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the feedback we might get.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word with E in position 3 and R in position 4.\n\nFor example, with S in position 1: S _ E R _\n\nThen positions 2 and 5: S [2] E R [5]\n\nWords: ""SUERY"" not, ""SAFER"" A absent, ""SEDGY"" D,G -> S-E-D-G-Y? But E in 2, not 3.\n\nWe need E in position 3, so it should be S [2] E R [5], so [2] cannot be E.\n\nFor example, ""SKERY"" not common, or ""SPERY"" not.\n\n""SKERF"" as I thought earlier: S-K-E-R-F, which is valid.\n\n""SKERF"" is a word (a variant of scarf or a heraldry term), but it\'s obscure.\n\nPerhaps ""UKASE"" but U and A, and E in 5.\n\nNot.\n\nGiven the constraints, ""ESKER"" is more common than ""SKERF"".\n\nSo I\'ll choose ""ESKER"".\n\nBut in ""ESKER"", S is in position 2, which is allowed, and we are testing K.\n\nIf it\'s not the word, we get feedback.\n\nSo guess: ""ESKER""\n\nBut let\'s double-check the position constraints for E: E must be in 1 or 3. In ""ESKER"", E is in 1 and 4. Position 1 is E, so it satisfies the constraint that E is in position 1 or 3. The constraint doesn\'t say it can\'t be in other positions, only that it must be in 1 or 3 (which it is, in 1).\n\nSimilarly for R: in position 5, which is allowed (4 or 5).\n\nS in position 2, which is allowed (1,2,4).\n\nAnd it includes all three.\n\nSo it\'s valid.\n\nTherefore, the guess is ""ESKER"".Based on the accumulated feedback:\n\n- **Absent letters (x)**: C, A, T, I, N, H, O (eliminated).\n- **Present letters (-)**: R, E, S (must be included, with specific position constraints).\n- **Position constraints**:\n  - R: Must be in position 4 or 5 (ruled out positions 1, 2, 3).\n  - E: Must be in position 1 or 3 (ruled out positions 2, 4, 5).\n  - S: Must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (ruled out positions 3, 5).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must include R, E, and S.\n- It must exclude all absent letters (C, A, T, I, N, H, O).\n- To adhere to position constraints and test new letters, the word **""ESKER""** is chosen because:\n  - E is in position 1 (allowed).\n  - S is in position 2 (allowed).\n  - K is a new letter (position 3).\n  - E is in position 4 (not constrained, as E can appear elsewhere if duplicated).\n  - R is in position 5 (allowed).\n- It is a valid English word (meaning a glacial ridge).\n\nThis guess tests the possibility of E duplication and the positions of R and S while introducing K.\n\n<guess>esker</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses**:\n   - **Guess 1 (crate)**: \n     - C, A, T are absent (x).\n     - R is present but not in position 2 (-).\n     - E is present but not in position 5 (-).\n   - **Guess 2 (risen)**:\n     - R is present but not in position 1 (-).\n     - I, N are absent (x).\n     - S is present but not in position 3 (-).\n     - E is present but not in position 4 (-).\n   - **Guess 3 (heros)**:\n     - H, O are absent (x).\n     - E is present but not in position 2 (-).\n     - R is present but not in position 3 (-).\n     - S is present but not in position 5 (-).\n\n2. **Deductions**:\n   - **Absent Letters**: C, A, T, I, N, H, O (cannot appear in the word).\n   - **Present Letters**: R, E, S (must appear at least once, with possible duplicates).\n   - **Position Constraints**:\n     - **R**: Cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from feedback). Must be in **position 4 or 5**.\n     - **E**: Cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from feedback). Must be in **position 1 or 3**.\n     - **S**: Cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from feedback). Must be in **position 1, 2, or 4**.\n   - **Word Structure**: The word must include R, E, S and two new letters (not absent). With 3 guesses left, prioritize testing common unused letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y) and validating positions.\n\n3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:\n   - **Address E Position**: E must be in position 1 or 3. Testing E in position 1 is efficient (covers one of the two options).\n   - **Address R Position**: R must be in position 4 or 5. Pairing R in position 5 with E in position 1 avoids conflicts.\n   - **Address S Position**: S must be in position 1, 2, or 4. With E in position 1, S can be in position 2 or 4 (position 1 is taken by E).\n   - **Maximize Information**: Use a word with E in position 1, S in position 2, and R in position 5 to test these constraints. Include new common letters (e.g., K) for coverage.\n   - **Word Selection**: ""ESKER"" fits:\n     - E in position 1 (allowed).\n     - S in position 2 (allowed).\n     - K (new letter) in position 3.\n     - E in position 4 (not constrained; possible duplicate).\n     - R in position 5 (allowed).\n   - **Why ""ESKER""?**:\n     - Validates E in position 1 and R in position 5.\n     - Tests S in position 2 and potential E duplication.\n     - Introduces K (common unused letter).\n     - Avoids all absent letters (C, A, T, I, N, H, O).\n     - Is a valid English word (meaning a glacial ridge).\n\n4. **Expected Outcomes**:\n   - If E in position 1 is correct, feedback will show ✓ for E.\n   - If R in position 5 is correct, feedback will show ✓ for R.\n   - Feedback on S (position 2) and K (position 3) will reveal if they are present/absent or in the right position.\n   - Duplicate E (position 4) may provide additional clues.\n\n<guess>esker</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: risen -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) S(-) E(-) N(x)\nGuess 3: heros -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(-) R(-) O(x) S(-)\nGuess 4: esker -> FEEDBACK: E(-) S(-) K(x) E(-) R(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from four guesses:

**Guess 1: crate**
- C: absent (x)
- R: present, wrong position (position 2) (-)
- A: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (position 5) (-)

**Guess 2: risen**
- R: present, wrong position (position 1) (-)
- I: absent (x)
- S: present, wrong position (position 3) (-)
- E: present, wrong position (position 4) (-)
- N: absent (x)

**Guess 3: heros**
- H: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (position 2) (-)
- R: present, wrong position (position 3) (-)
- O: absent (x)
- S: present, wrong position (position 5) (-)

**Guess 4: esker**
- E: present, wrong position (position 1) (-)
- S: present, wrong position (position 2) (-)
- K: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (position 4) (-) — note: duplicate E
- R: present, wrong position (position 5) (-)

### Key deductions:
1. **Absent letters (x)**: C, A, T, I, N, H, O, K (cannot be in the word).
2. **Present letters**: R, E, S (confirmed across multiple guesses). The duplicate E in ""esker"" (positions 1 and 4) both got ""-"", meaning:
   - E is in the word but not in position 1 or 4.
   - Since E is present and not in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (from previous feedback), the only remaining position for E is **position 3** (as deduced below).

### Position constraints from all feedback:
- **R**:
  - Not position 2 (from guess 1)
  - Not position 1 (guess 2)
  - Not position 3 (guess 3)
  - Not position 5 (guess 4: R in pos 5 is ""-"", meaning R is not in position 5)
  - Thus, R must be in **position 4** (only position left: 4).

- **E**:
  - Not position 5 (guess 1)
  - Not position 4 (guess 2)
  - Not position 2 (guess 3)
  - Not position 1 (guess 4)
  - Not position 4 again (guess 4, duplicate E in position 4 also ""-"")
  - Thus, E must be in **position 3** (only position left: 3).

- **S**:
  - Not position 3 (guess 2)
  - Not position 5 (guess 3)
  - Not position 2 (guess 4: S in pos 2 is ""-"")
  - Positions allowed: 1 or 4 (since 2,3,5 ruled out).

### Remaining information:
- The word has E in position 3 (fixed), R in position 4 (fixed), and S in either position 1 or 4. However, position 4 is occupied by R, so S cannot be in position 4 because R is there. Therefore, S must be in **position 1**.
- Structure: S _ E R _
- Positions:
  - Pos1: S (must be, since it can only be 1 or 4, and 4 is taken by R)
  - Pos3: E (confirmed)
  - Pos4: R (confirmed)
- We need letters for position 2 and 5, excluding absent letters (C,A,T,I,N,H,O,K) and using the present ones.

### Additional constraints:
- With E in position 3 and R in position 4, position 2 and 5 are open.
- Absent letters: C,A,T,I,N,H,O,K (so available letters: B,D,F,G,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z).
- The word must include only these, and since R,E,S are already placed, positions 2 and 5 should be filled with two new letters (which may or may not be duplicates, but no duplicates indicated yet).

### Forming the word:
- Known: Pos1: S, Pos3: E, Pos4: R → ""S _ E R _""
- Need 5-letter words of the form S ? E R ? 
- Exclude absent letters.

### Possible words:
- Example: ""SMEAR"" → but A is absent (ruled out).
- ""SWE(R)"" → incomplete.
- Common words: 
  - ""SLEER"" → not standard.
  - ""SMEER"" → variant spelling, possible.
  - ""SPEER"" → not common.
  - ""SWE(R)"" not.

Better options:
- ""SOWER"" → S-O-W-E-R, but O is absent (rule out). 
- ""SEWER"" → S-E-W-E-R → E in position 2 and 4, but we have E in position 3 already. Also, position 2: E? But E can only be in position 3 (fixed), so no duplicate E needed in other positions? However, feedback hasn't prohibited multiple Es; we don't know. But structure requires E at 3.

""SEWER"" has E at 2 (not allowed per our constraints).

Other words:
- ""SAFER"" → A absent.
- ""SERER"" → not common, duplicate R (but R is fixed at 4).

Actual candidate: 
- **""SUPER""**: S-U-P-E-R → but E is at position 4? Our word is S ? E R ? so position 3 is E, position 4 is R. ""SUPER"" has E at 4? S-U-P-E-R: S(1), U(2), P(3), E(4), R(5) → mismatched (we need E at 3, R at 4).

We need a word with:
- Pos1: S
- Pos2: ? (letter, say L)
- Pos3: E
- Pos4: R
- Pos5: ? (letter)

Examples:
- ""SLERF"" → not recognizable.
- ""SLE R"" not words.

More common:
- **""SOLER""**: S-O-L-E-R → but O is absent (rule out).
- **""SEDER""**: S-E-D-E-R → E at 1? No: S(1), E(2), D(3), E(4), R(5). But we need E at position 3, and here E is at 2 and 4. Also, D not tested, but E at 2 conflicts with rule (E not in pos 2).

We need pos3=E, pos4=R. In ""SEDER"", position 3 is D, not E.

Valid words:
- **""SKERR""** → not standard.
- **""SVE R""** not.

Using available letters:
D, F, G, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

- **""SPE R""**: ""sper"" not word.
- **""SME R""**: ""SMEAR"" invalid.

Another possibility: **""SLEER""** (to sleer means to be sly), but obscure.

**""SHE R""**: ""SH"" is S+H, but H is absent.

### Likely candidate: ""SLYER"" → S-L-Y-E-R 
But this is S(1), L(2), Y(3), E(4), R(5) → position 3 is Y, not E.

We need position 3 to be E → letter3 must be E.

So only pattern ""S [letter] E R [letter]""

Working words:
- **""SME R""**: ""smew"" not, but ""SMEAR"" invalid.
- **""SWER ""**: ""swick"" not.

After researching common English words:
- **""SEDGE R""** = 6 letters.
- **""SEWER""** not.
- **""SERER""** not.

But ""SURER"": S-U-R-E-R → S(1), U(2), R(3), E(4), R(5) → conflicts (need R at 4? But pos3=R? R can only be at pos4).

Position 3 must be E.

Alternative: Consider duplication possibilities.

We have 5 letters: S, ?, E, R, ?

Absent letters are fixed, so try:

- **""SLEER""**: S-L-E-E-R → which is S(1), L(2), E(3), E(4), R(5). E appears twice: at position 3 (good) and position 4. But E at position 4? Feedback already ruled out E at position 4 (guess 2). Guess 4 also confirmed E not at position 4. So E cannot be at position 4 → ""SLEER"" has E at 4? So cannot.

- **""SEWER""** has E at 4: invalid.

Must have no E in positions 1,2,4,5 → only position 3 for E.

Placement is rigid: word must be S ? E R ? 

Valid English words:
- **""SUPER""** → not, as E not at pos3.
- **""SKIER""** → S-K-I-E-R → I absent, E not at pos3.
- **""SEFER""** → Hebrew word, S-E-F-E-R → E at 1,2? No.

Discover: 
- **""SYE R""** not common.
- **""SMERK""** not.

### ""SVERD"" — not English.

Best available: **""SWERF""**? Not standard.

But I missed one: **""SEDER""** is S-E-D-E-R → wrong E positions.

After searching, we consider:
- **""SOLVER""** too long.
- **""SEVER""** = 5 letters: S-E-V-E-R → S(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), R(5) → E at position 2 and 4 → both ruled out (position 2 by guess 3, position 4 by guess 2 and 4).

So ""SEVER"" invalid.

Another possibility: Allow the word to have a different structure but we know positions fixed: S in pos1, E in pos3, R in pos4 → hence ""S X E R Y"" form.

Solutions: 
- ""SUEDR"" = not word.
- In geology, ""SEDGE"" = 5 letters but S-E-D-G-E → no R.

### Breakthrough: Accept that S can only be in pos1. Words matching ""S ? E R ?"":

- **""SPERM""**: S-P-E-R-M → this fits! S(1), P(2), E(3), R(4), M(5). 
  - P and M are not in absent list (C,A,T,I,N,H,O,K absent).
  - So ""SPERM"" is a valid English word.

Check constraints:
- E is in position 3: correct.
- R is in position 4: correct.
- S is in position 1: correct (allowed).
- Feedback for guess 4: position 1 E? Feedback was '-', meaning E present but wrong position → consistent with E not in pos1 but elsewhere (here pos3).
- Also, in ""esker"", all R, E, S were '-' and K absent → fits.

### Second candidate: ""SWERV"" – not standard.

Thus, ""SPERM"" is a strong candidate.

We have 2 guesses left, so it's reasonable to use ""SPERM"".

If not, next words could be like ""S E R M"", but ""SPERM"" exists.

Final deduction: The secret word must be ""SPERM"".

Therefore, guess ""SPERM"".

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### 1. **Review Feedback from All Guesses**:
   - **Absent Letters (x, cannot appear)**: C, A, T, I, N, H, O, K (from all feedback).
   - **Present Letters (- or ✓, must appear)**:
     - R, E, S: Confirmed present across multiple guesses.
     - E has duplicates (e.g., ""esker"" has two E's), but position constraints must be respected.
   - **Position Constraints**:
     - **R**:
       - ✗ Pos 2 (guess 1: ""crate"")  
       - ✗ Pos 1 (guess 2: ""risen"")  
       - ✗ Pos 3 (guess 3: ""heros"")  
       - ✗ Pos 5 (guess 4: ""esker"" R in pos 5 is -)  
       - → **R must be in position 4** (only remaining position).
     - **E**:
       - ✗ Pos 5 (guess 1: ""crate"")  
       - ✗ Pos 4 (guess 2: ""risen"")  
       - ✗ Pos 2 (guess 3: ""heros"")  
       - ✗ Pos 1 (guess 4: ""esker"" E in pos 1 is -)  
       - ✗ Pos 4 again (guess 4: duplicate E in pos 4 is -)  
       - → **E must be in position 3** (only remaining position).
     - **S**:
       - ✗ Pos 3 (guess 2: ""risen"")  
       - ✗ Pos 5 (guess 3: ""heros"")  
       - ✗ Pos 2 (guess 4: ""esker"" S in pos 2 is -)  
       - → S must be in position 1 or 4.  
       - But **R occupies position 4**, so **S must be in position 1**.

#### 2. **Deduced Word Structure**:
   - Position 1: S (fixed)  
   - Position 2: Unknown letter (not C,A,T,I,N,H,O,K)  
   - Position 3: E (fixed)  
   - Position 4: R (fixed)  
   - Position 5: Unknown letter (not C,A,T,I,N,H,O,K)  
   - → Word format: **S _ E R _**  
   - Remaining letters must be from: B, D, F, G, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, Z.

#### 3. **Strategy for Guess 5**:
   - With 2 guesses left, prioritize:
     1. **Testing possible words matching ""S _ E R _""**.
     2. **Using common letters** for positions 2 and 5 (e.g., M, P, L).  
   - Candidate words:
     - ""SPERM"": S-P-E-R-M (P and M are new, valid English word).
     - Others like ""SUBER"" (not common), ""SLEER"" (obsolete), or ""SWERF"" (invalid) are less ideal.
   - **Why ""SPERM""?**  
     - Fits all constraints:  
       - S in position 1 (allowed),  
       - E in position 3 (confirmed),  
       - R in position 4 (confirmed).  
     - Tests P (position 2) and M (position 5), which are common unused letters.  
     - If incorrect, feedback on P/M will reveal the final letters.

#### 4. **Final Validation**:
   - ""SPERM"" uses only allowed letters (no absent letters).  
   - Adheres to all position rules from feedback.  
   - Maximizes information gain with 1 guess left if needed.

<guess>sperm</guess>",sperm,"We have feedback from four guesses:

**Guess 1: crate**
- C: absent (x)
- R: present, wrong position (position 2) (-)

- S: present, wrong position (position 2) (-)
- K: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (position 4) (-) — note: duplicate E
- R: present, wrong position (position 5) (-)

### Key deductions:
1. **Absent letters (x)**: C, A, T, I, N, H, O, K (cannot be in the word).
2. **Present letters**: R, E, S (confirmed across multiple guesses). The duplicate E in ""esker"" (positions 1 and 4) both got ""-"", meaning:
   - E is in the word but not in position 1 or 4.
   - Since E is present and not in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (from previous feedback), the only remaining position for E is **position 3** (as deduced below).

### Position constraints from all feedback:
- **R**:
  - Not position 2 (from guess 1)
  - Not position 1 (guess 2)
  - Not position 3 (guess 3)
  - Not position 5 (guess 4: R in pos 5 is ""-"", meaning R is not in position 5)
  - Thus, R must be in **position 4** (only position left: 4).

- **E**:
  - Not position 5 (guess 1)
  - Not position 4 (guess 2)
  - Not position 2 (guess 3)
  - Not position 1 (guess 4)
  - Not position 4 again (guess 4, duplicate E in position 4 also ""-"")
  - Thus, E must be in **position 3** (only position left: 3).

- **S**:
  - Not position 3 (guess 2)
  - Not position 5 (guess 3)
  - Not position 2 (guess 4: S in pos 2 is ""-"")
  - Positions allowed: 1 or 4 (since 2,3,5 ruled out).

### Remaining information:
- The word has E in position 3 (fixed), R in position 4 (fixed), and S in either position 1 or 4. However, position 4 is occupied by R, so S cannot be in position 4 because R is there. Therefore, S must be in **position 1**.
- Structure: S _ E R _
- Positions:
  - Pos1: S (must be, since it can only be 1 or 4, and 4 is taken by R)
  - Pos3: E (confirmed)
  - Pos4: R (confirmed)
- We need letters for position 2 and 5, excluding absent letters (C,A,T,I,N,H,O,K) and using the present ones.

### Additional constraints:
- With E in position 3 and R in position 4, position 2 and 5 are open.
- Absent letters: C,A,T,I,N,H,O,K (so available letters: B,D,F,G,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z).
- The word must include only these, and since R,E,S are already placed, positions 2 and 5 should be filled with two new letters (which may or may not be duplicates, but no duplicates indicated yet).

### Forming the word:
- Known: Pos1: S, Pos3: E, Pos4: R → ""S _ E R _""
- Need 5-letter words of the form S ? E R ? 
- Exclude absent letters.

### Possible words:
- Example: ""SMEAR"" → but A is absent (ruled out).
- ""SWE(R)"" → incomplete.
- Common words: 
  - ""SLEER"" → not standard.
  - ""SMEER"" → variant spelling, possible.
  - ""SPEER"" → not common.
  - ""SWE(R)"" not.

Better options:
- ""SOWER"" → S-O-W-E-R, but O is absent (rule out). 
- ""SEWER"" → S-E-W-E-R → E in position 2 and 4, but we have E in position 3 already. Also, position 2: E? But E can only be in position 3 (fixed), so no duplicate E needed in other positions? However, feedback hasn't prohibited multiple Es; we don't know. But structure requires E at 3.

""SEWER"" has E at 2 (not allowed per our constraints).

Other words:
- ""SAFER"" → A absent.
- ""SERER"" → not common, duplicate R (but R is fixed at 4).

Actual candidate: 
- **""SUPER""**: S-U-P-E-R → but E is at position 4? Our word is S ? E R ? so position 3 is E, position 4 is R. ""SUPER"" has E at 4? S-U-P-E-R: S(1), U(2), P(3), E(4), R(5) → mismatched (we need E at 3, R at 4).

We need a word with:
- Pos1: S
- Pos2: ? (letter, say L)
- Pos3: E
- Pos4: R
- Pos5: ? (letter)

Examples:
- ""SLERF"" → not recognizable.
- ""SLE R"" not words.

More common:
- **""SOLER""**: S-O-L-E-R → but O is absent (rule out).
- **""SEDER""**: S-E-D-E-R → E at 1? No: S(1), E(2), D(3), E(4), R(5). But we need E at position 3, and here E is at 2 and 4. Also, D not tested, but E at 2 conflicts with rule (E not in pos 2).

We need pos3=E, pos4=R. In ""SEDER"", position 3 is D, not E.

Valid words:
- **""SKERR""** → not standard.
- **""SVE R""** not.

Using available letters:
D, F, G, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

- **""SPE R""**: ""sper"" not word.
- **""SME R""**: ""SMEAR"" invalid.

Another possibility: **""SLEER""** (to sleer means to be sly), but obscure.

**""SHE R""**: ""SH"" is S+H, but H is absent.

### Likely candidate: ""SLYER"" → S-L-Y-E-R 
But this is S(1), L(2), Y(3), E(4), R(5) → position 3 is Y, not E.

We need position 3 to be E → letter3 must be E.

So only pattern ""S [letter] E R [letter]""

Working words:
- **""SME R""**: ""smew"" not, but ""SMEAR"" invalid.
- **""SWER ""**: ""swick"" not.

After researching common English words:
- **""SEDGE R""** = 6 letters.
- **""SEWER""** not.
- **""SERER""** not.

But ""SURER"": S-U-R-E-R → S(1), U(2), R(3), E(4), R(5) → conflicts (need R at 4? But pos3=R? R can only be at pos4).

Position 3 must be E.

Alternative: Consider duplication possibilities.

We have 5 letters: S, ?, E, R, ?

Absent letters are fixed, so try:

- **""SLEER""**: S-L-E-E-R → which is S(1), L(2), E(3), E(4), R(5). E appears twice: at position 3 (good) and position 4. But E at position 4? Feedback already ruled out E at position 4 (guess 2). Guess 4 also confirmed E not at position 4. So E cannot be at position 4 → ""SLEER"" has E at 4? So cannot.

- **""SEWER""** has E at 4: invalid.

Must have no E in positions 1,2,4,5 → only position 3 for E.

Placement is rigid: word must be S ? E R ? 

Valid English words:
- **""SUPER""** → not, as E not at pos3.
- **""SKIER""** → S-K-I-E-R → I absent, E not at pos3.
- **""SEFER""** → Hebrew word, S-E-F-E-R → E at 1,2? No.

Discover: 
- **""SYE R""** not common.
- **""SMERK""** not.

### ""SVERD"" — not English.

Best available: **""SWERF""**? Not standard.

But I missed one: **""SEDER""** is S-E-D-E-R → wrong E positions.

After searching, we consider:
- **""SOLVER""** too long.
- **""SEVER""** = 5 letters: S-E-V-E-R → S(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), R(5) → E at position 2 and 4 → both ruled out (position 2 by guess 3, position 4 by guess 2 and 4).

So ""SEVER"" invalid.

Another possibility: Allow the word to have a different structure but we know positions fixed: S in pos1, E in pos3, R in pos4 → hence ""S X E R Y"" form.

Solutions: 
- ""SUEDR"" = not word.
- In geology, ""SEDGE"" = 5 letters but S-E-D-G-E → no R.

### Breakthrough: Accept that S can only be in pos1. Words matching ""S ? E R ?"":

- **""SPERM""**: S-P-E-R-M → this fits! S(1), P(2), E(3), R(4), M(5). 
  - P and M are not in absent list (C,A,T,I,N,H,O,K absent).
  - So ""SPERM"" is a valid English word.

Check constraints:
- E is in position 3: correct.
- R is in position 4: correct.
- S is in position 1: correct (allowed).
- Feedback for guess 4: position 1 E? Feedback was '-', meaning E present but wrong position → consistent with E not in pos1 but elsewhere (here pos3).
- Also, in ""esker"", all R, E, S were '-' and K absent → fits.

### Second candidate: ""SWERV"" – not standard.

Thus, ""SPERM"" is a strong candidate.

We have 2 guesses left, so it's reasonable to use ""SPERM"".

If not, next words could be like ""S E R M"", but ""SPERM"" exists.

Final deduction: The secret word must be ""SPERM"".

Therefore, guess ""SPERM"".### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### 1. **Review Feedback from All Guesses**:
   - **Absent Letters (x, cannot appear)**: C, A, T, I, N, H, O, K (from all feedback).
   - **Present Letters (- or ✓, must appear)**:
     - R, E, S: Confirmed present across multiple guesses.
     - E has duplicates (e.g., ""esker"" has two E's), but position constraints must be respected.
   - **Position Constraints**:
     - **R**:
       - ✗ Pos 2 (guess 1: ""crate"")  
       - ✗ Pos 1 (guess 2: ""risen"")  
       - ✗ Pos 3 (guess 3: ""heros"")  
       - ✗ Pos 5 (guess 4: ""esker"" R in pos 5 is -)  
       - → **R must be in position 4** (only remaining position).
     - **E**:
       - ✗ Pos 5 (guess 1: ""crate"")  
       - ✗ Pos 4 (guess 2: ""risen"")  
       - ✗ Pos 2 (guess 3: ""heros"")  
       - ✗ Pos 1 (guess 4: ""esker"" E in pos 1 is -)  
       - ✗ Pos 4 again (guess 4: duplicate E in pos 4 is -)  
       - → **E must be in position 3** (only remaining position).
     - **S**:
       - ✗ Pos 3 (guess 2: ""risen"")  
       - ✗ Pos 5 (guess 3: ""heros"")  
       - ✗ Pos 2 (guess 4: ""esker"" S in pos 2 is -)  
       - → S must be in position 1 or 4.  
       - But **R occupies position 4**, so **S must be in position 1**.

#### 2. **Deduced Word Structure**:
   - Position 1: S (fixed)  
   - Position 2: Unknown letter (not C,A,T,I,N,H,O,K)  
   - Position 3: E (fixed)  
   - Position 4: R (fixed)  
   - Position 5: Unknown letter (not C,A,T,I,N,H,O,K)  
   - → Word format: **S _ E R _**  
   - Remaining letters must be from: B, D, F, G, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, Z.

#### 3. **Strategy for Guess 5**:
   - With 2 guesses left, prioritize:
     1. **Testing possible words matching ""S _ E R _""**.
     2. **Using common letters** for positions 2 and 5 (e.g., M, P, L).  
   - Candidate words:
     - ""SPERM"": S-P-E-R-M (P and M are new, valid English word).
     - Others like ""SUBER"" (not common), ""SLEER"" (obsolete), or ""SWERF"" (invalid) are less ideal.
   - **Why ""SPERM""?**  
     - Fits all constraints:  
       - S in position 1 (allowed),  
       - E in position 3 (confirmed),  
       - R in position 4 (confirmed).  
     - Tests P (position 2) and M (position 5), which are common unused letters.  
     - If incorrect, feedback on P/M will reveal the final letters.

#### 4. **Final Validation**:
   - ""SPERM"" uses only allowed letters (no absent letters).  
   - Adheres to all position rules from feedback.  
   - Maximizes information gain with 1 guess left if needed.
