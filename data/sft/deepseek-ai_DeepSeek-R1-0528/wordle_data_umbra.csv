We are at the start of the game. We have no prior feedback. We need to pick a strong starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and avoids repeating letters to maximize information gain.
 Some common starting words are: ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that includes frequent letters in English 5-letter words: 
 E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

 I will choose ""CRATE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, T).

 So, let's start with ""CRATE"".
</think>
<thinking>
I'm starting the game and need to make my first guess. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get. A good starting word typically:

1. Uses common letters in the English language to increase chances of hits.
2. Has unique letters (no duplicates) to test more letters at once.
3. Includes a mix of vowels and consonants.

Based on common Wordle starting strategies, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are often effective. I'll select ""CRANE"" because:
- It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, allowing me to check five different letters at once.
- It provides a balanced structure for positional testing.

This choice should give solid initial feedback to build upon in subsequent guesses.

We have the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the word.
 R(-) -> R is in the word but not in the second position.
 A(-) -> A is in the word but not in the third position.
 N(x) -> N is not in the word.
 E(x) -> E is not in the word.

 So, we know:
 - The word contains R and A, but R is not in the second position and A is not in the third position.
 - The word does not contain C, N, or E.

 Since R and A are present, we need to include them in our next guess, but in different positions.

 Let's think about possible positions for R and A.
 - R was guessed in position 2, but it's not there. So R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. But note: the word has 5 positions.
 - A was guessed in position 3, but it's not there. So A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Also, we must avoid letters C, N, E (because they are not in the word).

 We can try to form a new word that includes R and A, in positions different from before, and using other common letters that haven't been tried yet.

 Some common letters to consider: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

 We should avoid repeating the same letters we already know are absent.

 Possible approach: 
 - Since R wasn't in position 2, let's try R in a position other than 2.
   For example, we might try R in position 1 or 4 or 5.
 - Similarly, A can be tried in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, but not 3.

 We also want to test new letters.

 Let's consider a word that has:
 - R in a new position, say position 1: then we'd have R _ _ _ _
 - But note: we must also have A somewhere. So we could put A in position 2? But position 2 is available for A because in the first guess position 3 was wrong for A and position 2 was R which we know is not the case now.

 However, we must not put R in position 2 again? Actually, the game doesn't forbid that, but we know R is not in position 2, so we avoid it.

 Let me sketch a word: 
 Option: Start with R? Then we have R in position 1. Then we can put A in position 2? But wait: the feedback for the previous A was that it's in the word but not in position 3. It might be in position 2. So let's try that.

 Word: R A _ _ _

 Then we need three more letters. We must avoid C, N, E. Also, common letters: T, S, L, etc.

 But note: we are guessing a full word. Let's try ""RATIO""?

 ""RATIO"": 
 - R in position 1: if the word has R in position 1, it would be correct. But we don't know that yet. Our previous feedback only tells us R is in the word, not which position. So we are testing position 1 for R.
 - A in position 2: similarly, testing if A is in position 2.
 - T, I, O are new letters.

 Alternatively, we might want to avoid using too many vowels? But let's see the letter distribution.

 Another common word: ""ROAST"", but we have S and T available. However, note we must avoid E (present in roast? wait no, E is avoided). ROAST: R, O, A, S, T.

 But let's check positions:
 - R in position 1: same as above.
 - O in position 2: new.
 - A in position 3: wait, in the first guess we learned that A is not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3, that would be a mistake? Actually, we know A is not in position 3 from the first feedback. So we must put A in a different position: not position 3. Therefore, ""ROAST"" puts A in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

 How about ""RASTA""? Not a word.

 How about ""RALLY""? But L might be an option? But in ""RALLY"": 
 - Position 1: R
 - Position 2: A
 - Position 3: L
 - Position 4: L -> duplicate letter. Also, we are avoiding duplicates? Not necessarily, but usually it's better to have distinct letters to gain more information.

 However, note the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't know. So for maximum information, distinct letters are better.

 So let's aim for distinct letters.

 Word: R A _ _ _

 We need three letters. We have many possibilities.

 Possibilities: 
 - R A T I O -> ""RATIO""
 - R A I S E -> but E is absent, so avoid.
 - R A I S T -> ""RAITS"" not a word.
 - R A S P Y -> ""RASPY"": contains S, P, Y.

 Another: R A D A R -> duplicate and not distinct.

 How about ""RAPID""? 
 - R in 1
 - A in 2
 - P in 3
 - I in 4
 - D in 5

 And we haven't tried P, I, D.

 Similarly, ""RALLY"" has duplicate L.

 What about ""RUSTS""? duplicate S and we know S?

 Actually, let's check common words.

 Let me fix R in position 1 and A in position 2? But wait, what if the R is not in position 1? Then we might get wrong feedback. But we need to test.

 Alternative: put R and A in positions we haven't tested. For example, put R in position 4 and A in position 5? Then we can use a word that ends with ""RA"". But that might be less common.

 Since we don't know the positions, it's better to choose a word that puts R and A in different positions and uses other common letters.

 Considering the feedback, let me think of words that:
 - Include R and A (must include them)
 - Exclude C, E, N
 - Put R not in position 2 and A not in position 3.

 So for R: possible positions: 1, 3, 4, 5
 For A: possible positions: 1, 2, 4, 5

 We have two known letters and three unknown.

 Another candidate: ""PARTY""
 - P: new
 - A: in position 2? 
 - R: in position 3? because we know R is not in position 2, so position 3 is new? 
 Actually, in ""PARTY"": 
   P in 1
   A in 2
   R in 3
   T in 4
   Y in 5

 This satisfies:
 - R is in position 3 (which is new) -> testing R in position 3
 - A is in position 2 (which is new for A) -> testing A in position 2
 - We avoid positions that we know are wrong: A is not in position 3 (and here we have A in 2 which is okay) and R is not in position 2 (we have R in 3).

 Also, we introduce P, T, Y.

 Another candidate: ""TRAIN""
 - T in 1
 - R in 2 -> but we know R is not in position 2! So this is invalid because we are putting R in the same wrong position? No, wait: we know from the feedback that R is in the word but not in position 2. Therefore, we must avoid placing R in position 2 again. So ""TRAIN"" has R in position 2 -> we should exclude this guess? Actually, we can still put it, but it would be inefficient because we know R isn't there. So better avoid.

 Thus, ""PARTY"" seems a good choice.

 However, note in ""PARTY"": 
 Position 1: P -> if we put A in position 1? But we don't have A in position 1 here. And R in position 3.

 But in the first guess, we didn't test position 1 at all? We had ""crane"": position 1 was C (absent), so we don't know about position 1.

 But we need to test valid words.

 Let me think if there is a better word.

 Another: ""ROBIN"" -> but O and B. However, in ""ROBIN"": 
 - R in position 1 -> okay
 - O in position 2 -> okay
 - B in position 3 -> okay
 - I in position 4 -> okay
 - N -> but N is absent! So we cannot use N. So avoid ""ROBIN"".

 Another: ""MAKER""
 - M in 1 -> okay
 - A in 2 -> okay (testing A in 2)
 - K in 3 -> okay
 - E in 4 -> but E is absent! So avoid.

 After considering alternatives, ""PARTY"" looks good.

 But what about ""PARTS""? 
 ""PARTS"": 
 - P in 1
 - A in 2
 - R in 3
 - T in 4
 - S in 5

 This also works. And S is a very common letter.

 Similarly, ""RANTS"" has N -> absent? So avoid.

 How about ""BARTS""? But B? And we don't know B? But note: we don't have any information about B. However, avoid because we are testing a small set? Actually, ""BARTS"" is not a common word. Let me check: BART? Not standard.

 Actually, ""PARTS"" is a word.

 But comparing ""PARTY"" vs ""PARTS"": 
 Both introduce P, A, R, T. One has T and S? ""PARTS"": P, A, R, T, S.

 Wait, ""PARTY"" has Y and ""PARTS"" has S. Both are common.

 How about ""RASPY""?
 ""RASPY"": 
 - R in 1
 - A in 2
 - S in 3
 - P in 4
 - Y in 5

 Also, avoids the forbidden positions: A is not in position 3 (we have A in 2) and R is not in position 2 (here R is in 1).

 And we introduce S, P, Y.

 I think ""RASPY"" is another candidate.

 But note: in the first guess, we didn't test position 3 with A? Actually we did (with ""crane"" position 3: A got '-', meaning A exists but not in that position). But ""RASPY"" has A in position 2: that's a testable position.

 Now, between ""PARTY"", ""PARTS"", and ""RASPY"", which gives more information? 
 - They all have R and A.
 - ""PARTY"" and ""PARTS"" (if chosen) only introduce one new vowel (if any) and consonants. Actually, ""PARTS"" doesn't have vowel besides A? But none of them has vowels except A? That's fine.

 Alternatively, we might want to test for vowels? But we already know E is absent. So O, I, U are vowels we haven't tested? Actually, we haven't tested O, I, U.

 In ""RATIO"": 
 - R in 1
 - A in 2
 - T in 3
 - I in 4
 - O in 5

 This introduces T, I, O. And we test A in position 2 and R in position 1.

 Importantly, it tests two new vowels: I and O.

 But note: we haven't tested any vowels except A? And A we know is present. The others? Not yet.

 First guess ""crane"" had A and E. We know E is absent. So O, I, U are still possibilities.

 Therefore, ""RATIO"" might be better because it tests two common vowels.

 And it avoids: C, N, E.

 So let's go with ""RATIO"".

 Structure:
 Position 1: R -> testing position 1 for R? (previously R was in position 2, which didn't work)
 Position 2: A -> testing position 2 for A? (previously A was in position 3, which didn't work)
 Position 3: T -> new letter, new position
 Position 4: I -> new letter
 Position 5: O -> new letter

 If the feedback shows:
 - R in position 1: correct? Then we know part of the word.
 - Or maybe only a minus? Then we know it's somewhere else.

 Similarly for A.

 So I think ""RATIO"" is a strong candidate.

 But what if the word doesn't have T, I, or O? We might get x's and narrow down.

 Therefore, I choose ""RATIO"".
</think>
### Step-by-Step Thought Process:
- **Analyze previous feedback**:  
  The first guess for ""crane"" received:  
  - C: ❌ (not in the word)  
  - R: ➖ (in the word, wrong position)  
  - A: ➖ (in the word, wrong position)  
  - N: ❌ (not in the word)  
  - E: ❌ (not in the word)  
  
- **Key deductions**:  
  - The secret word contains **R** and **A**, but neither is in the guessed position (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).  
  - Letters **C, N, E** are absent and must be excluded from future guesses.  
  - Possible positions for R: 1, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is eliminated).  
  - Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is eliminated).  

- **Strategy for second guess**:  
  - Must reuse confirmed letters **R** and **A** in new positions.  
  - Avoid eliminated letters (**C, N, E**).  
  - Include new common letters (e.g., T, I, O, S) to maximize information gain.  
  - Prioritize distinct letters to test more characters.  
  - Strong candidates:  
    - ""**RATIO**"" tests R in position 1 (new), A in position 2 (new), and introduces T, I, O (all high-frequency letters).  
    - Alternatives like ""PARTY"" or ""RASPY"" were considered but ""RATIO"" provides broader vowel/consonant coverage.  

- **Why ""RATIO""?**  
  - Positions comply with feedback: R not in 2, A not in 3.  
  - Introduces 3 new untested letters (**T, I, O**).  
  - Common word structure increases the probability of positional hits.  

<guess>ratio</guess>",ratio,"We have the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the word.
 R(-) -> R is in the word but not in the second position.
 A(-) -> A is in the word but not in the third position.
 N(x) -> N is not in the word.
 E(x) -> E is not in the word.

 So, we know:
 - The word contains R and A, but R is not in the second position and A is not in the third position.
 - The word does not contain C, N, or E.

 Since R and A are present, we need to include them in our next guess, but in different positions.

 Let's think about possible positions for R and A.
 - R was guessed in position 2, but it's not there. So R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. But note: the word has 5 positions.
 - A was guessed in position 3, but it's not there. So A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Also, we must avoid letters C, N, E (because they are not in the word).

 We can try to form a new word that includes R and A, in positions different from before, and using other common letters that haven't been tried yet.

 Some common letters to consider: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

 We should avoid repeating the same letters we already know are absent.

 Possible approach: 
 - Since R wasn't in position 2, let's try R in a position other than 2.
   For example, we might try R in position 1 or 4 or 5.
 - Similarly, A can be tried in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, but not 3.

 We also want to test new letters.

 Let's consider a word that has:
 - R in a new position, say position 1: then we'd have R _ _ _ _
 - But note: we must also have A somewhere. So we could put A in position 2? But position 2 is available for A because in the first guess position 3 was wrong for A and position 2 was R which we know is not the case now.

 However, we must not put R in position 2 again? Actually, the game doesn't forbid that, but we know R is not in position 2, so we avoid it.

 Let me sketch a word: 
 Option: Start with R? Then we have R in position 1. Then we can put A in position 2? But wait: the feedback for the previous A was that it's in the word but not in position 3. It might be in position 2. So let's try that.

 Word: R A _ _ _

 Then we need three more letters. We must avoid C, N, E. Also, common letters: T, S, L, etc.

 But note: we are guessing a full word. Let's try ""RATIO""?

 ""RATIO"": 
 - R in position 1: if the word has R in position 1, it would be correct. But we don't know that yet. Our previous feedback only tells us R is in the word, not which position. So we are testing position 1 for R.
 - A in position 2: similarly, testing if A is in position 2.
 - T, I, O are new letters.

 Alternatively, we might want to avoid using too many vowels? But let's see the letter distribution.

 Another common word: ""ROAST"", but we have S and T available. However, note we must avoid E (present in roast? wait no, E is avoided). ROAST: R, O, A, S, T.

 But let's check positions:
 - R in position 1: same as above.
 - O in position 2: new.
 - A in position 3: wait, in the first guess we learned that A is not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3, that would be a mistake? Actually, we know A is not in position 3 from the first feedback. So we must put A in a different position: not position 3. Therefore, ""ROAST"" puts A in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

 How about ""RASTA""? Not a word.

 How about ""RALLY""? But L might be an option? But in ""RALLY"": 
 - Position 1: R
 - Position 2: A
 - Position 3: L
 - Position 4: L -> duplicate letter. Also, we are avoiding duplicates? Not necessarily, but usually it's better to have distinct letters to gain more information.

 However, note the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't know. So for maximum information, distinct letters are better.

 So let's aim for distinct letters.

 Word: R A _ _ _

 We need three letters. We have many possibilities.

 Possibilities: 
 - R A T I O -> ""RATIO""
 - R A I S E -> but E is absent, so avoid.
 - R A I S T -> ""RAITS"" not a word.
 - R A S P Y -> ""RASPY"": contains S, P, Y.

 Another: R A D A R -> duplicate and not distinct.

 How about ""RAPID""? 
 - R in 1
 - A in 2
 - P in 3
 - I in 4
 - D in 5

 And we haven't tried P, I, D.

 Similarly, ""RALLY"" has duplicate L.

 What about ""RUSTS""? duplicate S and we know S?

 Actually, let's check common words.

 Let me fix R in position 1 and A in position 2? But wait, what if the R is not in position 1? Then we might get wrong feedback. But we need to test.

 Alternative: put R and A in positions we haven't tested. For example, put R in position 4 and A in position 5? Then we can use a word that ends with ""RA"". But that might be less common.

 Since we don't know the positions, it's better to choose a word that puts R and A in different positions and uses other common letters.

 Considering the feedback, let me think of words that:
 - Include R and A (must include them)
 - Exclude C, E, N
 - Put R not in position 2 and A not in position 3.

 So for R: possible positions: 1, 3, 4, 5
 For A: possible positions: 1, 2, 4, 5

 We have two known letters and three unknown.

 Another candidate: ""PARTY""
 - P: new
 - A: in position 2? 
 - R: in position 3? because we know R is not in position 2, so position 3 is new? 
 Actually, in ""PARTY"": 
   P in 1
   A in 2
   R in 3
   T in 4
   Y in 5

 This satisfies:
 - R is in position 3 (which is new) -> testing R in position 3
 - A is in position 2 (which is new for A) -> testing A in position 2
 - We avoid positions that we know are wrong: A is not in position 3 (and here we have A in 2 which is okay) and R is not in position 2 (we have R in 3).

 Also, we introduce P, T, Y.

 Another candidate: ""TRAIN""
 - T in 1
 - R in 2 -> but we know R is not in position 2! So this is invalid because we are putting R in the same wrong position? No, wait: we know from the feedback that R is in the word but not in position 2. Therefore, we must avoid placing R in position 2 again. So ""TRAIN"" has R in position 2 -> we should exclude this guess? Actually, we can still put it, but it would be inefficient because we know R isn't there. So better avoid.

 Thus, ""PARTY"" seems a good choice.

 However, note in ""PARTY"": 
 Position 1: P -> if we put A in position 1? But we don't have A in position 1 here. And R in position 3.

 But in the first guess, we didn't test position 1 at all? We had ""crane"": position 1 was C (absent), so we don't know about position 1.

 But we need to test valid words.

 Let me think if there is a better word.

 Another: ""ROBIN"" -> but O and B. However, in ""ROBIN"": 
 - R in position 1 -> okay
 - O in position 2 -> okay
 - B in position 3 -> okay
 - I in position 4 -> okay
 - N -> but N is absent! So we cannot use N. So avoid ""ROBIN"".

 Another: ""MAKER""
 - M in 1 -> okay
 - A in 2 -> okay (testing A in 2)
 - K in 3 -> okay
 - E in 4 -> but E is absent! So avoid.

 After considering alternatives, ""PARTY"" looks good.

 But what about ""PARTS""? 
 ""PARTS"": 
 - P in 1
 - A in 2
 - R in 3
 - T in 4
 - S in 5

 This also works. And S is a very common letter.

 Similarly, ""RANTS"" has N -> absent? So avoid.

 How about ""BARTS""? But B? And we don't know B? But note: we don't have any information about B. However, avoid because we are testing a small set? Actually, ""BARTS"" is not a common word. Let me check: BART? Not standard.

 Actually, ""PARTS"" is a word.

 But comparing ""PARTY"" vs ""PARTS"": 
 Both introduce P, A, R, T. One has T and S? ""PARTS"": P, A, R, T, S.

 Wait, ""PARTY"" has Y and ""PARTS"" has S. Both are common.

 How about ""RASPY""?
 ""RASPY"": 
 - R in 1
 - A in 2
 - S in 3
 - P in 4
 - Y in 5

 Also, avoids the forbidden positions: A is not in position 3 (we have A in 2) and R is not in position 2 (here R is in 1).

 And we introduce S, P, Y.

 I think ""RASPY"" is another candidate.

 But note: in the first guess, we didn't test position 3 with A? Actually we did (with ""crane"" position 3: A got '-', meaning A exists but not in that position). But ""RASPY"" has A in position 2: that's a testable position.

 Now, between ""PARTY"", ""PARTS"", and ""RASPY"", which gives more information? 
 - They all have R and A.
 - ""PARTY"" and ""PARTS"" (if chosen) only introduce one new vowel (if any) and consonants. Actually, ""PARTS"" doesn't have vowel besides A? But none of them has vowels except A? That's fine.

 Alternatively, we might want to test for vowels? But we already know E is absent. So O, I, U are vowels we haven't tested? Actually, we haven't tested O, I, U.

 In ""RATIO"": 
 - R in 1
 - A in 2
 - T in 3
 - I in 4
 - O in 5

 This introduces T, I, O. And we test A in position 2 and R in position 1.

 Importantly, it tests two new vowels: I and O.

 But note: we haven't tested any vowels except A? And A we know is present. The others? Not yet.

 First guess ""crane"" had A and E. We know E is absent. So O, I, U are still possibilities.

 Therefore, ""RATIO"" might be better because it tests two common vowels.

 And it avoids: C, N, E.

 So let's go with ""RATIO"".

 Structure:
 Position 1: R -> testing position 1 for R? (previously R was in position 2, which didn't work)
 Position 2: A -> testing position 2 for A? (previously A was in position 3, which didn't work)
 Position 3: T -> new letter, new position
 Position 4: I -> new letter
 Position 5: O -> new letter

 If the feedback shows:
 - R in position 1: correct? Then we know part of the word.
 - Or maybe only a minus? Then we know it's somewhere else.

 Similarly for A.

 So I think ""RATIO"" is a strong candidate.

 But what if the word doesn't have T, I, or O? We might get x's and narrow down.

 Therefore, I choose ""RATIO"".### Step-by-Step Thought Process:
- **Analyze previous feedback**:  
  The first guess for ""crane"" received:  
  - C: ❌ (not in the word)  
  - R: ➖ (in the word, wrong position)  
  - A: ➖ (in the word, wrong position)  
  - N: ❌ (not in the word)  
  - E: ❌ (not in the word)  
  
- **Key deductions**:  
  - The secret word contains **R** and **A**, but neither is in the guessed position (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).  
  - Letters **C, N, E** are absent and must be excluded from future guesses.  
  - Possible positions for R: 1, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is eliminated).  
  - Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is eliminated).  

- **Strategy for second guess**:  
  - Must reuse confirmed letters **R** and **A** in new positions.  
  - Avoid eliminated letters (**C, N, E**).  
  - Include new common letters (e.g., T, I, O, S) to maximize information gain.  
  - Prioritize distinct letters to test more characters.  
  - Strong candidates:  
    - ""**RATIO**"" tests R in position 1 (new), A in position 2 (new), and introduces T, I, O (all high-frequency letters).  
    - Alternatives like ""PARTY"" or ""RASPY"" were considered but ""RATIO"" provides broader vowel/consonant coverage.  

- **Why ""RATIO""?**  
  - Positions comply with feedback: R not in 2, A not in 3.  
  - Introduces 3 new untested letters (**T, I, O**).  
  - Common word structure increases the probability of positional hits.",Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are at the start of the game. We have no prior feedback. We need to pick a strong starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and avoids repeating letters to maximize information gain.
 Some common starting words are: ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that includes frequent letters in English 5-letter words: 
 E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

 I will choose ""CRATE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, T).

 So, let's start with ""CRATE"".<thinking>
I'm starting the game and need to make my first guess. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get. A good starting word typically:

1. Uses common letters in the English language to increase chances of hits.
2. Has unique letters (no duplicates) to test more letters at once.
3. Includes a mix of vowels and consonants.

Based on common Wordle starting strategies, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are often effective. I'll select ""CRANE"" because:
- It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, allowing me to check five different letters at once.
- It provides a balanced structure for positional testing.

This choice should give solid initial feedback to build upon in subsequent guesses.
</thinking>

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the word.
 R(-) -> R is in the word but not in the second position.
 A(-) -> A is in the word but not in the third position.
 N(x) -> N is not in the word.
 E(x) -> E is not in the word.

 So, we know:
 - The word contains R and A, but R is not in the second position and A is not in the third position.
 - The word does not contain C, N, or E.

 Since R and A are present, we need to include them in our next guess, but in different positions.

 Let's think about possible positions for R and A.
 - R was guessed in position 2, but it's not there. So R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. But note: the word has 5 positions.
 - A was guessed in position 3, but it's not there. So A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Also, we must avoid letters C, N, E (because they are not in the word).

 We can try to form a new word that includes R and A, in positions different from before, and using other common letters that haven't been tried yet.

 Some common letters to consider: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

 We should avoid repeating the same letters we already know are absent.

 Possible approach: 
 - Since R wasn't in position 2, let's try R in a position other than 2.
   For example, we might try R in position 1 or 4 or 5.
 - Similarly, A can be tried in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, but not 3.

 We also want to test new letters.

 Let's consider a word that has:
 - R in a new position, say position 1: then we'd have R _ _ _ _
 - But note: we must also have A somewhere. So we could put A in position 2? But position 2 is available for A because in the first guess position 3 was wrong for A and position 2 was R which we know is not the case now.

 However, we must not put R in position 2 again? Actually, the game doesn't forbid that, but we know R is not in position 2, so we avoid it.

 Let me sketch a word: 
 Option: Start with R? Then we have R in position 1. Then we can put A in position 2? But wait: the feedback for the previous A was that it's in the word but not in position 3. It might be in position 2. So let's try that.

 Word: R A _ _ _

 Then we need three more letters. We must avoid C, N, E. Also, common letters: T, S, L, etc.

 But note: we are guessing a full word. Let's try ""RATIO""?

 ""RATIO"": 
 - R in position 1: if the word has R in position 1, it would be correct. But we don't know that yet. Our previous feedback only tells us R is in the word, not which position. So we are testing position 1 for R.
 - A in position 2: similarly, testing if A is in position 2.
 - T, I, O are new letters.

 Alternatively, we might want to avoid using too many vowels? But let's see the letter distribution.

 Another common word: ""ROAST"", but we have S and T available. However, note we must avoid E (present in roast? wait no, E is avoided). ROAST: R, O, A, S, T.

 But let's check positions:
 - R in position 1: same as above.
 - O in position 2: new.
 - A in position 3: wait, in the first guess we learned that A is not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3, that would be a mistake? Actually, we know A is not in position 3 from the first feedback. So we must put A in a different position: not position 3. Therefore, ""ROAST"" puts A in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

 How about ""RASTA""? Not a word.

 How about ""RALLY""? But L might be an option? But in ""RALLY"": 
 - Position 1: R
 - Position 2: A
 - Position 3: L
 - Position 4: L -> duplicate letter. Also, we are avoiding duplicates? Not necessarily, but usually it's better to have distinct letters to gain more information.

 However, note the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't know. So for maximum information, distinct letters are better.

 So let's aim for distinct letters.

 Word: R A _ _ _

 We need three letters. We have many possibilities.

 Possibilities: 
 - R A T I O -> ""RATIO""
 - R A I S E -> but E is absent, so avoid.
 - R A I S T -> ""RAITS"" not a word.
 - R A S P Y -> ""RASPY"": contains S, P, Y.

 Another: R A D A R -> duplicate and not distinct.

 How about ""RAPID""? 
 - R in 1
 - A in 2
 - P in 3
 - I in 4
 - D in 5

 And we haven't tried P, I, D.

 Similarly, ""RALLY"" has duplicate L.

 What about ""RUSTS""? duplicate S and we know S?

 Actually, let's check common words.

 Let me fix R in position 1 and A in position 2? But wait, what if the R is not in position 1? Then we might get wrong feedback. But we need to test.

 Alternative: put R and A in positions we haven't tested. For example, put R in position 4 and A in position 5? Then we can use a word that ends with ""RA"". But that might be less common.

 Since we don't know the positions, it's better to choose a word that puts R and A in different positions and uses other common letters.

 Considering the feedback, let me think of words that:
 - Include R and A (must include them)
 - Exclude C, E, N
 - Put R not in position 2 and A not in position 3.

 So for R: possible positions: 1, 3, 4, 5
 For A: possible positions: 1, 2, 4, 5

 We have two known letters and three unknown.

 Another candidate: ""PARTY""
 - P: new
 - A: in position 2? 
 - R: in position 3? because we know R is not in position 2, so position 3 is new? 
 Actually, in ""PARTY"": 
   P in 1
   A in 2
   R in 3
   T in 4
   Y in 5

 This satisfies:
 - R is in position 3 (which is new) -> testing R in position 3
 - A is in position 2 (which is new for A) -> testing A in position 2
 - We avoid positions that we know are wrong: A is not in position 3 (and here we have A in 2 which is okay) and R is not in position 2 (we have R in 3).

 Also, we introduce P, T, Y.

 Another candidate: ""TRAIN""
 - T in 1
 - R in 2 -> but we know R is not in position 2! So this is invalid because we are putting R in the same wrong position? No, wait: we know from the feedback that R is in the word but not in position 2. Therefore, we must avoid placing R in position 2 again. So ""TRAIN"" has R in position 2 -> we should exclude this guess? Actually, we can still put it, but it would be inefficient because we know R isn't there. So better avoid.

 Thus, ""PARTY"" seems a good choice.

 However, note in ""PARTY"": 
 Position 1: P -> if we put A in position 1? But we don't have A in position 1 here. And R in position 3.

 But in the first guess, we didn't test position 1 at all? We had ""crane"": position 1 was C (absent), so we don't know about position 1.

 But we need to test valid words.

 Let me think if there is a better word.

 Another: ""ROBIN"" -> but O and B. However, in ""ROBIN"": 
 - R in position 1 -> okay
 - O in position 2 -> okay
 - B in position 3 -> okay
 - I in position 4 -> okay
 - N -> but N is absent! So we cannot use N. So avoid ""ROBIN"".

 Another: ""MAKER""
 - M in 1 -> okay
 - A in 2 -> okay (testing A in 2)
 - K in 3 -> okay
 - E in 4 -> but E is absent! So avoid.

 After considering alternatives, ""PARTY"" looks good.

 But what about ""PARTS""? 
 ""PARTS"": 
 - P in 1
 - A in 2
 - R in 3
 - T in 4
 - S in 5

 This also works. And S is a very common letter.

 Similarly, ""RANTS"" has N -> absent? So avoid.

 How about ""BARTS""? But B? And we don't know B? But note: we don't have any information about B. However, avoid because we are testing a small set? Actually, ""BARTS"" is not a common word. Let me check: BART? Not standard.

 Actually, ""PARTS"" is a word.

 But comparing ""PARTY"" vs ""PARTS"": 
 Both introduce P, A, R, T. One has T and S? ""PARTS"": P, A, R, T, S.

 Wait, ""PARTY"" has Y and ""PARTS"" has S. Both are common.

 How about ""RASPY""?
 ""RASPY"": 
 - R in 1
 - A in 2
 - S in 3
 - P in 4
 - Y in 5

 Also, avoids the forbidden positions: A is not in position 3 (we have A in 2) and R is not in position 2 (here R is in 1).

 And we introduce S, P, Y.

 I think ""RASPY"" is another candidate.

 But note: in the first guess, we didn't test position 3 with A? Actually we did (with ""crane"" position 3: A got '-', meaning A exists but not in that position). But ""RASPY"" has A in position 2: that's a testable position.

 Now, between ""PARTY"", ""PARTS"", and ""RASPY"", which gives more information? 
 - They all have R and A.
 - ""PARTY"" and ""PARTS"" (if chosen) only introduce one new vowel (if any) and consonants. Actually, ""PARTS"" doesn't have vowel besides A? But none of them has vowels except A? That's fine.

 Alternatively, we might want to test for vowels? But we already know E is absent. So O, I, U are vowels we haven't tested? Actually, we haven't tested O, I, U.

 In ""RATIO"": 
 - R in 1
 - A in 2
 - T in 3
 - I in 4
 - O in 5

 This introduces T, I, O. And we test A in position 2 and R in position 1.

 Importantly, it tests two new vowels: I and O.

 But note: we haven't tested any vowels except A? And A we know is present. The others? Not yet.

 First guess ""crane"" had A and E. We know E is absent. So O, I, U are still possibilities.

 Therefore, ""RATIO"" might be better because it tests two common vowels.

 And it avoids: C, N, E.

 So let's go with ""RATIO"".

 Structure:

 Position 2: A -> testing position 2 for A? (previously A was in position 3, which didn't work)
 Position 3: T -> new letter, new position
 Position 4: I -> new letter
 Position 5: O -> new letter

 If the feedback shows:
 - R in position 1: correct? Then we know part of the word.
 - Or maybe only a minus? Then we know it's somewhere else.

 Similarly for A.

 So I think ""RATIO"" is a strong candidate.

 But what if the word doesn't have T, I, or O? We might get x's and narrow down.

 Therefore, I choose ""RATIO"".### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

Actually, the game doesn\'t forbid that, but we know R is not in position 2, so we avoid it.\n\n Let me sketch a word: \n Option: Start with R? Then we have R in position 1. Then we can put A in position 2? But wait: the feedback for the previous A was that it\'s in the word but not in position 3. It might be in position 2. So let\'s try that.\n\n Word: R A _ _ _\n\n Then we need three more letters. We must avoid C, N, E. Also, common letters: T, S, L, etc.\n\n But note: we are guessing a full word. Let\'s try ""RATIO""?\n\n ""RATIO"": \n - R in position 1: if the word has R in position 1, it would be correct. But we don\'t know that yet. Our previous feedback only tells us R is in the word, not which position. So we are testing position 1 for R.\n - A in position 2: similarly, testing if A is in position 2.\n - T, I, O are new letters.\n\n Alternatively, we might want to avoid using too many vowels? But let\'s see the letter distribution.\n\n Another common word: ""ROAST"", but we have S and T available. However, note we must avoid E (present in roast? wait no, E is avoided). ROAST: R, O, A, S, T.\n\n But let\'s check positions:\n - R in position 1: same as above.\n - O in position 2: new.\n - A in position 3: wait, in the first guess we learned that A is not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3, that would be a mistake? Actually, we know A is not in position 3 from the first feedback. So we must put A in a different position: not position 3. Therefore, ""ROAST"" puts A in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.\n\n How about ""RASTA""? Not a word.\n\n How about ""RALLY""? But L might be an option? But in ""RALLY"": \n - Position 1: R\n - Position 2: A\n - Position 3: L\n - Position 4: L -> duplicate letter. Also, we are avoiding duplicates? Not necessarily, but usually it\'s better to have distinct letters to gain more information.\n\n However, note the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t know. So for maximum information, distinct letters are better.\n\n So let\'s aim for distinct letters.\n\n Word: R A _ _ _\n\n We need three letters. We have many possibilities.\n\n Possibilities: \n - R A T I O -> ""RATIO""\n - R A I S E -> but E is absent, so avoid.\n - R A I S T -> ""RAITS"" not a word.\n - R A S P Y -> ""RASPY"": contains S, P, Y.\n\n Another: R A D A R -> duplicate and not distinct.\n\n How about ""RAPID""? \n - R in 1\n - A in 2\n - P in 3\n - I in 4\n - D in 5\n\n And we haven\'t tried P, I, D.\n\n Similarly, ""RALLY"" has duplicate L.\n\n What about ""RUSTS""? duplicate S and we know S?\n\n Actually, let\'s check common words.\n\n Let me fix R in position 1 and A in position 2? But wait, what if the R is not in position 1? Then we might get wrong feedback. But we need to test.\n\n Alternative: put R and A in positions we haven\'t tested. For example, put R in position 4 and A in position 5? Then we can use a word that ends with ""RA"". But that might be less common.\n\n Since we don\'t know the positions, it\'s better to choose a word that puts R and A in different positions and uses other common letters.\n\n Considering the feedback, let me think of words that:\n - Include R and A (must include them)\n - Exclude C, E, N\n - Put R not in position 2 and A not in position 3.\n\n So for R: possible positions: 1, 3, 4, 5\n For A: possible positions: 1, 2, 4, 5\n\n We have two known letters and three unknown.\n\n Another candidate: ""PARTY""\n - P: new\n - A: in position 2? \n - R: in position 3? because we know R is not in position 2, so position 3 is new? \n Actually, in ""PARTY"": \n   P in 1\n   A in 2\n   R in 3\n   T in 4\n   Y in 5\n\n This satisfies:\n - R is in position 3 (which is new) -> testing R in position 3\n - A is in position 2 (which is new for A) -> testing A in position 2\n - We avoid positions that we know are wrong: A is not in position 3 (and here we have A in 2 which is okay) and R is not in position 2 (we have R in 3).\n\n Also, we introduce P, T, Y.\n\n Another candidate: ""TRAIN""\n - T in 1\n - R in 2 -> but we know R is not in position 2! So this is invalid because we are putting R in the same wrong position? No, wait: we know from the feedback that R is in the word but not in position 2. Therefore, we must avoid placing R in position 2 again. So ""TRAIN"" has R in position 2 -> we should exclude this guess? Actually, we can still put it, but it would be inefficient because we know R isn\'t there. So better avoid.\n\n Thus, ""PARTY"" seems a good choice.\n\n However, note in ""PARTY"": \n Position 1: P -> if we put A in position 1? But we don\'t have A in position 1 here. And R in position 3.\n\n But in the first guess, we didn\'t test position 1 at all? We had ""crane"": position 1 was C (absent), so we don\'t know about position 1.\n\n But we need to test valid words.\n\n Let me think if there is a better word.\n\n Another: ""ROBIN"" -> but O and B. However, in ""ROBIN"": \n - R in position 1 -> okay\n - O in position 2 -> okay\n - B in position 3 -> okay\n - I in position 4 -> okay\n - N -> but N is absent! So we cannot use N. So avoid ""ROBIN"".\n\n Another: ""MAKER""\n - M in 1 -> okay\n - A in 2 -> okay (testing A in 2)\n - K in 3 -> okay\n - E in 4 -> but E is absent! So avoid.\n\n After considering alternatives, ""PARTY"" looks good.\n\n But what about ""PARTS""? \n ""PARTS"": \n - P in 1\n - A in 2\n - R in 3\n - T in 4\n - S in 5\n\n This also works. And S is a very common letter.\n\n Similarly, ""RANTS"" has N -> absent? So avoid.\n\n How about ""BARTS""? But B? And we don\'t know B? But note: we don\'t have any information about B. However, avoid because we are testing a small set? Actually, ""BARTS"" is not a common word. Let me check: BART? Not standard.\n\n Actually, ""PARTS"" is a word.\n\n But comparing ""PARTY"" vs ""PARTS"": \n Both introduce P, A, R, T. One has T and S? ""PARTS"": P, A, R, T, S.\n\n Wait, ""PARTY"" has Y and ""PARTS"" has S. Both are common.\n\n How about ""RASPY""?\n ""RASPY"": \n - R in 1\n - A in 2\n - S in 3\n - P in 4\n - Y in 5\n\n Also, avoids the forbidden positions: A is not in position 3 (we have A in 2) and R is not in position 2 (here R is in 1).\n\n And we introduce S, P, Y.\n\n I think ""RASPY"" is another candidate.\n\n But note: in the first guess, we didn\'t test position 3 with A? Actually we did (with ""crane"" position 3: A got \'-\', meaning A exists but not in that position). But ""RASPY"" has A in position 2: that\'s a testable position.\n\n Now, between ""PARTY"", ""PARTS"", and ""RASPY"", which gives more information? \n - They all have R and A.\n - ""PARTY"" and ""PARTS"" (if chosen) only introduce one new vowel (if any) and consonants. Actually, ""PARTS"" doesn\'t have vowel besides A? But none of them has vowels except A? That\'s fine.\n\n Alternatively, we might want to test for vowels? But we already know E is absent. So O, I, U are vowels we haven\'t tested? Actually, we haven\'t tested O, I, U.\n\n In ""RATIO"": \n - R in 1\n - A in 2\n - T in 3\n - I in 4\n - O in 5\n\n This introduces T, I, O. And we test A in position 2 and R in position 1.\n\n Importantly, it tests two new vowels: I and O.\n\n But note: we haven\'t tested any vowels except A? And A we know is present. The others? Not yet.\n\n First guess ""crane"" had A and E. We know E is absent. So O, I, U are still possibilities.\n\n Therefore, ""RATIO"" might be better because it tests two common vowels.\n\n And it avoids: C, N, E.\n\n So let\'s go with ""RATIO"".\n\n Structure:\n Position 1: R -> testing position 1 for R? (previously R was in position 2, which didn\'t work)\n Position 2: A -> testing position 2 for A? (previously A was in position 3, which didn\'t work)\n Position 3: T -> new letter, new position\n Position 4: I -> new letter\n Position 5: O -> new letter\n\n If the feedback shows:\n - R in position 1: correct? Then we know part of the word.\n - Or maybe only a minus? Then we know it\'s somewhere else.\n\n Similarly for A.\n\n So I think ""RATIO"" is a strong candidate.\n\n But what if the word doesn\'t have T, I, or O? We might get x\'s and narrow down.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""RATIO"".### Step-by-Step Thought Process:\n- **Analyze previous feedback**:  \n  The first guess for ""crane"" received:  \n  - C: ❌ (not in the word)  \n  - R: ➖ (in the word, wrong position)  \n  - A: ➖ (in the word, wrong position)  \n  - N: ❌ (not in the word)  \n  - E: ❌ (not in the word)  \n  \n- **Key deductions**:  \n  - The secret word contains **R** and **A**, but neither is in the guessed position (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).  \n  - Letters **C, N, E** are absent and must be excluded from future guesses.  \n  - Possible positions for R: 1, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is eliminated).  \n  - Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is eliminated).  \n\n- **Strategy for second guess**:  \n  - Must reuse confirmed letters **R** and **A** in new positions.  \n  - Avoid eliminated letters (**C, N, E**).  \n  - Include new common letters (e.g., T, I, O, S) to maximize information gain.  \n  - Prioritize distinct letters to test more characters.  \n  - Strong candidates:  \n    - ""**RATIO**"" tests R in position 1 (new), A in position 2 (new), and introduces T, I, O (all high-frequency letters).  \n    - Alternatives like ""PARTY"" or ""RASPY"" were considered but ""RATIO"" provides broader vowel/consonant coverage.  \n\n- **Why ""RATIO""?**  \n  - Positions comply with feedback: R not in 2, A not in 3.  \n  - Introduces 3 new untested letters (**T, I, O**).  \n  - Common word structure increases the probability of positional hits.\n\n<guess>ratio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, wrong position)
  A: - (in word, wrong position)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""ratio""
  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> so R is in the word but not in position 1 (since we tried position 1 now) and not in position 2 (from first guess)
  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word but not in position 2 (tried now) and not in position 3 (from first guess)
  T: x (not in word)
  I: x (not in word)
  O: x (not in word)

So now we know:
- The word contains R and A, but not in positions 1,2 (for R) and not in positions 2,3 (for A). 
  Therefore, possible positions for R: 3, 4, 5 (since positions 1 and 2 are eliminated)
  Possible positions for A: 1, 4, 5 (positions 2 and 3 are eliminated)

- Additionally, we know the word does NOT contain: C, N, E, T, I, O.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, I, O. So we should avoid these except R and A which are present.

We need to form a new word that:
- Includes R and A (must include them because they are present)
- Avoids C, N, E, T, I, O (absent letters)
- Places R in one of the possible positions: 3, 4, or 5
- Places A in one of the possible positions: 1, 4, or 5 (but note: if we put A in 4 or 5, and R in 4 or 5, they might conflict? But they can be in the same word? Only if the word has duplicate letters? But we don't know. We must consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but for now, we assume distinct until proven otherwise? Actually, we don't have evidence of duplicates, so we try distinct.

We also want to test new common letters to get more information.

Common letters left: S, L, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, etc.

We have 3 positions to fill (besides R and A) and we need to choose letters that are common and not yet tested.

Let's list the positions and assign:

We know:
- Position 1: cannot be R (from guess2) and cannot be A? Actually, A can be in position 1. But we don't know. Similarly, position 2: cannot be A (from guess2) and cannot be R (from guess1). So position 2 must be a new letter.

Possible positions for A: 1,4,5
Possible positions for R: 3,4,5

We must assign R and A to two of these positions without conflict? But they could be in the same position? No, because they are different letters. So they must be in different positions.

So the positions for R and A must be two distinct positions from {1,4,5} for A and {3,4,5} for R. The overlapping position is 4 and 5. So they can both be in 4 and 5? But that would require the word to have two of the same position? No, we assign one letter per position.

So the possible pairs (A position, R position) are:
- A in 1, R in 3
- A in 1, R in 4
- A in 1, R in 5
- A in 4, R in 3
- A in 4, R in 5
- A in 5, R in 3
- A in 5, R in 4

But note: if we put A in 4 and R in 4, that's impossible. So we must choose different positions.

So the valid pairs are all except when both are in the same position.

Now, we also have to fill the other three positions with new letters.

We need to pick a word that fits one of these patterns and uses new letters.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: A in position 1, R in position 3.
Then the word: A _ R _ _
We need to fill positions 2,4,5 with new letters (avoiding C,N,E,T,I,O).

Possible words: 
- A U R A (but duplicate A? and we don't know if duplicates are allowed) -> avoid duplicates for now.
- A L R ? ? 
  - ""ALARM"" -> but has A again and M? But we don't know if A is duplicated? Also, M is new. But ""ALARM"" has two A's? So if the word has duplicate A, it's possible. But we don't have evidence. Let's avoid for now and try distinct.
- ""ALERT"" -> but E and T are absent -> invalid.
- ""ALBUM"" -> but B, U, M. But ""ALBUM"" has A in 1, L in 2, B in 3? But we need R in 3. So not.

Actually, with A in 1 and R in 3: A _ R _ _
We need a word: 
Position 2: must be a consonant? Let's try S: A S R _ _ -> ""ASSAY"" has duplicate S? and Y. But ""ASSAY"" is A S S A Y -> duplicates and A again. Not good.

Another: ""AWRY"" -> too short.

Hard to find. Maybe this pattern is less common.

Option 2: A in 1, R in 4.
Word: A _ _ R _
We need to fill positions 2,3,5.

Possible: 
- ""A P R I C"" -> but I and C are absent -> invalid.
- ""A P R O D"" -> O absent.
- ""A D R I P"" -> I absent.

With new letters: 
- ""A D R U M"" -> A, D, R, U, M -> ""ADRUM""? Not a word.
- ""A M B R Y"" -> ""AMBRY"" is a word? It means a storage place. But let's see: A in 1, M in 2, B in 3, R in 4, Y in 5. And we avoid absent letters. So ""AMBRY"" is acceptable? But it's uncommon.

Option 3: A in 1, R in 5.
Word: A _ _ _ R
Examples: ""A P P L Y"" -> duplicate P -> avoid.
"" A B U S R"" -> not a word.

"" A F T E R"" -> E and T absent -> invalid.

"" A L A R M"" -> duplicate A -> avoid.

"" A Z U R E"" -> E absent -> invalid.

Not easy.

Option 4: A in 4, R in 3.
Word: _ _ R A _
We need to fill positions 1,2,5.

This pattern is common? 
- ""B R A V O"" -> O absent -> invalid.
- ""D R A M A"" -> duplicate A -> avoid.
- ""P R A M S"" -> ""PRAMS"" is a word? P in 1, R in 2? But wait: we have R in position 3? No, in this pattern: position 3 is R and position 4 is A. So the word: _ _ R A _ 
So position 1 and 2 and 5.

Example: ""P U R A L"" -> ""PURAL""? Not a word.
"" F R A C T"" -> C and T absent -> invalid.
"" B R A V E"" -> E absent -> invalid.

But note: we can use S, L, etc.

"" S U R A L"" -> ""SURAL"" is an adjective relating to the calf of the leg. It's a word. 
S in 1, U in 2, R in 3, A in 4, L in 5. 
And we avoid absent letters: S, U, L are new and not in the absent list.

So ""SURAL"" is a candidate.

Option 5: A in 4, R in 5.
Word: _ _ _ A R
We need to fill positions 1,2,3.

Example: ""L A R A R"" -> duplicate -> avoid.
"" S C A R R"" -> duplicate R and C absent -> invalid.
"" D E A R "" -> too short.

"" U L N A R"" -> ""ULNAR"" is a word (relating to the ulna). 
U in 1, L in 2, N in 3? But N is absent -> invalid.

"" R A D A R"" -> duplicate and R in 1? But we are putting R in 5? And A in 4? So ""RADAR"" would be R in 1, A in 2, D in 3, A in 4, R in 5 -> duplicates and also we are putting R in 1 which we know is not allowed? Because from guess2, R is not in position 1. So we cannot put R in 1.

So we must avoid position 1 for R.

Therefore, in this pattern, position 1 must not be R. So we need a word: _ _ _ A R, with the first three positions being new letters and not R.

Example: ""P L A Y R"" -> not a word.
"" S H A R R"" -> duplicate R -> avoid.

"" L A P S R"" -> not a word.

Hard.

Option 6: A in 5, R in 3.
Word: _ _ R _ A
We need to fill positions 1,2,4.

Example: ""B A R B A"" -> duplicate -> avoid.
"" C A R T A"" -> duplicate A and C absent -> invalid.
"" P A R L A"" -> duplicate A -> avoid.

"" U R B A N"" -> N absent -> invalid.

"" B U R L A"" -> ""BURLA"" is not a word? 
"" B U R S A"" -> ""BURSA"" is a word (a sac in the body). 
B in 1, U in 2, R in 3, S in 4, A in 5. 
This avoids absent letters: B, U, S are new. 
So ""BURSA"" is a candidate.

Option 7: A in 5, R in 4.
Word: _ _ _ R A
We need to fill positions 1,2,3.

Example: ""O P E R A"" -> O and E absent -> invalid.
"" U L T R A"" -> U, L, T -> but T is absent -> invalid.
"" E X T R A"" -> E and T absent -> invalid.

"" S U P R A"" -> S, U, P -> ""SUPRA"" is a word (meaning above). 
S in 1, U in 2, P in 3, R in 4, A in 5. 
This uses new letters and avoids absent ones. 
So ""SUPRA"" is a candidate.

Now, we have a few candidates:
- From option4: ""SURAL"" (if we put A in 4 and R in 3)
- From option6: ""BURSA"" (A in 5, R in 3)
- From option7: ""SUPRA"" (A in 5, R in 4)

We also had ""AMBRY"" from option2? But it's uncommon.

We need to choose one that tests new common letters.

Let's list the new letters each candidate uses:
- ""SURAL"": S, U, L
- ""BURSA"": B, U, S (but note: S is in both, and U is in both? Actually, ""BURSA"" has B, U, R, S, A -> R and A are known, so new are B, U, S)
- ""SUPRA"": S, U, P, R, A -> new: S, U, P

All are testing S and U. Then ""SURAL"" tests L, ""BURSA"" tests B, ""SUPRA"" tests P.

Common letters: S is very common, then U, P, L, B.

We want to maximize information. Since we have three positions to fill, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

But note: in ""BURSA"", the letter S is in position 4? And in ""SURAL"", S is in position 1. In ""SUPRA"", S is in position 1.

Also, we are testing different positions for R and A.

We must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence, so we assume distinct.

I think ""SUPRA"" is a good choice because:
- It tests R in position 4 (which is a possible position) and A in position 5 (also possible).
- It uses common letters: S, U, P.

But let's check the pattern: _ _ _ R A -> positions 1,2,3 are S, U, P.

We haven't tested position 1,2,3 with these letters.

Alternatively, ""SURAL"" tests R in position 3 and A in position 4, which are also possible.

But ""SUPRA"" might be more common? And it has P which is a common consonant.

Another candidate: what about ""PURDA"" (a veil)? But ""PURDA"" has P, U, R, D, A -> and D is new. But ""PURDA"" is not very common.

We might also consider ""SURLY"", but Y is new? But ""SURLY"" has S, U, R, L, Y. But in ""SURLY"": 
- S in 1, U in 2, R in 3, L in 4, Y in 5.
But we are testing A? We must include A! ""SURLY"" doesn't have A. So we cannot use it because we must include A.

Similarly, we must include both R and A.

So back to the candidates.

I think ""SUPRA"" is a valid word and tests new letters.

But let me confirm: 
- We are putting R in position 4: which is a possible position (from the allowed 3,4,5) and we haven't tested position 4 for R before? 
  In guess1, R was in position 2 -> not there.
  In guess2, R was in position 1 -> not there.
  So position 4 is new for R.
- A in position 5: 
  In guess1, A was in position 3 -> not there.
  In guess2, A was in position 2 -> not there.
  So position 5 is new for A.

And we are testing S in position 1, U in position 2, P in position 3.

So I think ""SUPRA"" is a good guess.

But note: ""SUPRA"" is a valid English word (used as a prefix or standalone meaning above).

Therefore, I choose ""SUPRA"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"") Feedback**:  
  - C: ❌ (absent)  
  - R: ➖ (present, wrong position)  
  - A: ➖ (present, wrong position)  
  - N: ❌ (absent)  
  - E: ❌ (absent)  
- **Guess 2 (""ratio"") Feedback**:  
  - R: ➖ (present, wrong position)  
  - A: ➖ (present, wrong position)  
  - T: ❌ (absent)  
  - I: ❌ (absent)  
  - O: ❌ (absent)  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed Letters**:  
   - **R** and **A** are in the word but not in the positions guessed:  
     - R is **not** in position 1 (tested in ""ratio"") or 2 (tested in ""crane"").  
     - A is **not** in position 2 (tested in ""ratio"") or 3 (tested in ""crane"").  
   - Possible positions for R: **3, 4, or 5**.  
   - Possible positions for A: **1, 4, or 5**.  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   - C, N, E, T, I, O are **not in the word**. Avoid reusing these.  

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Must include **R** and **A** in new positions (not 1/2 for R, not 2/3 for A).  
   - Use new high-frequency letters (e.g., S, U, P, L, B) to maximize information.  
   - Prioritize testing R in position 4 or 5 and A in position 1, 4, or 5 (without conflicting positions).  
   - After evaluating options like ""SURAL"" (A in 4, R in 3) and ""BURSA"" (A in 5, R in 3), **""SUPRA""** was selected because:  
     - Puts R in position 4 (untested position).  
     - Puts A in position 5 (untested position).  
     - Introduces new common letters: **S** (position 1), **U** (position 2), **P** (position 3).  
     - Avoids duplicate letters and absent letters.  

<guess>supra</guess>",supra,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, wrong position)
  A: - (in word, wrong position)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""ratio""
  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> so R is in the word but not in position 1 (since we tried position 1 now) and not in position 2 (from first guess)
  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word but not in position 2 (tried now) and not in position 3 (from first guess)
  T: x (not in word)
  I: x (not in word)
  O: x (not in word)

So now we know:
- The word contains R and A, but not in positions 1,2 (for R) and not in positions 2,3 (for A). 
  Therefore, possible positions for R: 3, 4, 5 (since positions 1 and 2 are eliminated)
  Possible positions for A: 1, 4, 5 (positions 2 and 3 are eliminated)

- Additionally, we know the word does NOT contain: C, N, E, T, I, O.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, I, O. So we should avoid these except R and A which are present.

We need to form a new word that:
- Includes R and A (must include them because they are present)
- Avoids C, N, E, T, I, O (absent letters)
- Places R in one of the possible positions: 3, 4, or 5
- Places A in one of the possible positions: 1, 4, or 5 (but note: if we put A in 4 or 5, and R in 4 or 5, they might conflict? But they can be in the same word? Only if the word has duplicate letters? But we don't know. We must consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but for now, we assume distinct until proven otherwise? Actually, we don't have evidence of duplicates, so we try distinct.

We also want to test new common letters to get more information.

Common letters left: S, L, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, etc.

We have 3 positions to fill (besides R and A) and we need to choose letters that are common and not yet tested.

Let's list the positions and assign:

We know:
- Position 1: cannot be R (from guess2) and cannot be A? Actually, A can be in position 1. But we don't know. Similarly, position 2: cannot be A (from guess2) and cannot be R (from guess1). So position 2 must be a new letter.

Possible positions for A: 1,4,5
Possible positions for R: 3,4,5

We must assign R and A to two of these positions without conflict? But they could be in the same position? No, because they are different letters. So they must be in different positions.

So the positions for R and A must be two distinct positions from {1,4,5} for A and {3,4,5} for R. The overlapping position is 4 and 5. So they can both be in 4 and 5? But that would require the word to have two of the same position? No, we assign one letter per position.

So the possible pairs (A position, R position) are:
- A in 1, R in 3
- A in 1, R in 4
- A in 1, R in 5
- A in 4, R in 3
- A in 4, R in 5
- A in 5, R in 3
- A in 5, R in 4

But note: if we put A in 4 and R in 4, that's impossible. So we must choose different positions.

So the valid pairs are all except when both are in the same position.

Now, we also have to fill the other three positions with new letters.

We need to pick a word that fits one of these patterns and uses new letters.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: A in position 1, R in position 3.
Then the word: A _ R _ _
We need to fill positions 2,4,5 with new letters (avoiding C,N,E,T,I,O).

Possible words: 
- A U R A (but duplicate A? and we don't know if duplicates are allowed) -> avoid duplicates for now.
- A L R ? ? 
  - ""ALARM"" -> but has A again and M? But we don't know if A is duplicated? Also, M is new. But ""ALARM"" has two A's? So if the word has duplicate A, it's possible. But we don't have evidence. Let's avoid for now and try distinct.
- ""ALERT"" -> but E and T are absent -> invalid.
- ""ALBUM"" -> but B, U, M. But ""ALBUM"" has A in 1, L in 2, B in 3? But we need R in 3. So not.

Actually, with A in 1 and R in 3: A _ R _ _
We need a word: 
Position 2: must be a consonant? Let's try S: A S R _ _ -> ""ASSAY"" has duplicate S? and Y. But ""ASSAY"" is A S S A Y -> duplicates and A again. Not good.

Another: ""AWRY"" -> too short.

Hard to find. Maybe this pattern is less common.

Option 2: A in 1, R in 4.
Word: A _ _ R _
We need to fill positions 2,3,5.

Possible: 
- ""A P R I C"" -> but I and C are absent -> invalid.
- ""A P R O D"" -> O absent.
- ""A D R I P"" -> I absent.

With new letters: 
- ""A D R U M"" -> A, D, R, U, M -> ""ADRUM""? Not a word.
- ""A M B R Y"" -> ""AMBRY"" is a word? It means a storage place. But let's see: A in 1, M in 2, B in 3, R in 4, Y in 5. And we avoid absent letters. So ""AMBRY"" is acceptable? But it's uncommon.

Option 3: A in 1, R in 5.
Word: A _ _ _ R
Examples: ""A P P L Y"" -> duplicate P -> avoid.
"" A B U S R"" -> not a word.

"" A F T E R"" -> E and T absent -> invalid.

"" A L A R M"" -> duplicate A -> avoid.

"" A Z U R E"" -> E absent -> invalid.

Not easy.

Option 4: A in 4, R in 3.
Word: _ _ R A _
We need to fill positions 1,2,5.

This pattern is common? 
- ""B R A V O"" -> O absent -> invalid.
- ""D R A M A"" -> duplicate A -> avoid.
- ""P R A M S"" -> ""PRAMS"" is a word? P in 1, R in 2? But wait: we have R in position 3? No, in this pattern: position 3 is R and position 4 is A. So the word: _ _ R A _ 
So position 1 and 2 and 5.

Example: ""P U R A L"" -> ""PURAL""? Not a word.
"" F R A C T"" -> C and T absent -> invalid.
"" B R A V E"" -> E absent -> invalid.

But note: we can use S, L, etc.

"" S U R A L"" -> ""SURAL"" is an adjective relating to the calf of the leg. It's a word. 
S in 1, U in 2, R in 3, A in 4, L in 5. 
And we avoid absent letters: S, U, L are new and not in the absent list.

So ""SURAL"" is a candidate.

Option 5: A in 4, R in 5.
Word: _ _ _ A R
We need to fill positions 1,2,3.

Example: ""L A R A R"" -> duplicate -> avoid.
"" S C A R R"" -> duplicate R and C absent -> invalid.
"" D E A R "" -> too short.

"" U L N A R"" -> ""ULNAR"" is a word (relating to the ulna). 
U in 1, L in 2, N in 3? But N is absent -> invalid.

"" R A D A R"" -> duplicate and R in 1? But we are putting R in 5? And A in 4? So ""RADAR"" would be R in 1, A in 2, D in 3, A in 4, R in 5 -> duplicates and also we are putting R in 1 which we know is not allowed? Because from guess2, R is not in position 1. So we cannot put R in 1.

So we must avoid position 1 for R.

Therefore, in this pattern, position 1 must not be R. So we need a word: _ _ _ A R, with the first three positions being new letters and not R.

Example: ""P L A Y R"" -> not a word.
"" S H A R R"" -> duplicate R -> avoid.

"" L A P S R"" -> not a word.

Hard.

Option 6: A in 5, R in 3.
Word: _ _ R _ A
We need to fill positions 1,2,4.

Example: ""B A R B A"" -> duplicate -> avoid.
"" C A R T A"" -> duplicate A and C absent -> invalid.
"" P A R L A"" -> duplicate A -> avoid.

"" U R B A N"" -> N absent -> invalid.

"" B U R L A"" -> ""BURLA"" is not a word? 
"" B U R S A"" -> ""BURSA"" is a word (a sac in the body). 
B in 1, U in 2, R in 3, S in 4, A in 5. 
This avoids absent letters: B, U, S are new. 
So ""BURSA"" is a candidate.

Option 7: A in 5, R in 4.
Word: _ _ _ R A
We need to fill positions 1,2,3.

Example: ""O P E R A"" -> O and E absent -> invalid.
"" U L T R A"" -> U, L, T -> but T is absent -> invalid.
"" E X T R A"" -> E and T absent -> invalid.

"" S U P R A"" -> S, U, P -> ""SUPRA"" is a word (meaning above). 
S in 1, U in 2, P in 3, R in 4, A in 5. 
This uses new letters and avoids absent ones. 
So ""SUPRA"" is a candidate.

Now, we have a few candidates:
- From option4: ""SURAL"" (if we put A in 4 and R in 3)
- From option6: ""BURSA"" (A in 5, R in 3)
- From option7: ""SUPRA"" (A in 5, R in 4)

We also had ""AMBRY"" from option2? But it's uncommon.

We need to choose one that tests new common letters.

Let's list the new letters each candidate uses:
- ""SURAL"": S, U, L
- ""BURSA"": B, U, S (but note: S is in both, and U is in both? Actually, ""BURSA"" has B, U, R, S, A -> R and A are known, so new are B, U, S)
- ""SUPRA"": S, U, P, R, A -> new: S, U, P

All are testing S and U. Then ""SURAL"" tests L, ""BURSA"" tests B, ""SUPRA"" tests P.

Common letters: S is very common, then U, P, L, B.

We want to maximize information. Since we have three positions to fill, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

But note: in ""BURSA"", the letter S is in position 4? And in ""SURAL"", S is in position 1. In ""SUPRA"", S is in position 1.

Also, we are testing different positions for R and A.

We must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence, so we assume distinct.

I think ""SUPRA"" is a good choice because:
- It tests R in position 4 (which is a possible position) and A in position 5 (also possible).
- It uses common letters: S, U, P.

But let's check the pattern: _ _ _ R A -> positions 1,2,3 are S, U, P.

We haven't tested position 1,2,3 with these letters.

Alternatively, ""SURAL"" tests R in position 3 and A in position 4, which are also possible.

But ""SUPRA"" might be more common? And it has P which is a common consonant.

Another candidate: what about ""PURDA"" (a veil)? But ""PURDA"" has P, U, R, D, A -> and D is new. But ""PURDA"" is not very common.

We might also consider ""SURLY"", but Y is new? But ""SURLY"" has S, U, R, L, Y. But in ""SURLY"": 
- S in 1, U in 2, R in 3, L in 4, Y in 5.
But we are testing A? We must include A! ""SURLY"" doesn't have A. So we cannot use it because we must include A.

Similarly, we must include both R and A.

So back to the candidates.

I think ""SUPRA"" is a valid word and tests new letters.

But let me confirm: 
- We are putting R in position 4: which is a possible position (from the allowed 3,4,5) and we haven't tested position 4 for R before? 
  In guess1, R was in position 2 -> not there.
  In guess2, R was in position 1 -> not there.
  So position 4 is new for R.
- A in position 5: 
  In guess1, A was in position 3 -> not there.
  In guess2, A was in position 2 -> not there.
  So position 5 is new for A.

And we are testing S in position 1, U in position 2, P in position 3.

So I think ""SUPRA"" is a good guess.

But note: ""SUPRA"" is a valid English word (used as a prefix or standalone meaning above).

Therefore, I choose ""SUPRA"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"") Feedback**:  
  - C: ❌ (absent)  
  - R: ➖ (present, wrong position)  
  - A: ➖ (present, wrong position)  
  - N: ❌ (absent)  
  - E: ❌ (absent)  
- **Guess 2 (""ratio"") Feedback**:  
  - R: ➖ (present, wrong position)  
  - A: ➖ (present, wrong position)  
  - T: ❌ (absent)  
  - I: ❌ (absent)  
  - O: ❌ (absent)  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed Letters**:  
   - **R** and **A** are in the word but not in the positions guessed:  
     - R is **not** in position 1 (tested in ""ratio"") or 2 (tested in ""crane"").  
     - A is **not** in position 2 (tested in ""ratio"") or 3 (tested in ""crane"").  
   - Possible positions for R: **3, 4, or 5**.  
   - Possible positions for A: **1, 4, or 5**.  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   - C, N, E, T, I, O are **not in the word**. Avoid reusing these.  

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Must include **R** and **A** in new positions (not 1/2 for R, not 2/3 for A).  
   - Use new high-frequency letters (e.g., S, U, P, L, B) to maximize information.  
   - Prioritize testing R in position 4 or 5 and A in position 1, 4, or 5 (without conflicting positions).  
   - After evaluating options like ""SURAL"" (A in 4, R in 3) and ""BURSA"" (A in 5, R in 3), **""SUPRA""** was selected because:  
     - Puts R in position 4 (untested position).  
     - Puts A in position 5 (untested position).  
     - Introduces new common letters: **S** (position 1), **U** (position 2), **P** (position 3).  
     - Avoids duplicate letters and absent letters.",Guess 3: supra -> FEEDBACK: S(x) U(-) P(x) R(✓) A(✓),FAIL

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are at the start of the game. We have no prior feedback. We need to pick a strong starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and avoids repeating letters to maximize information gain.
 Some common starting words are: ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that includes frequent letters in English 5-letter words: 
 E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

 I will choose ""CRATE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, T).

 So, let's start with ""CRATE"".<thinking>
I'm starting the game and need to make my first guess. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get. A good starting word typically:

1. Uses common letters in the English language to increase chances of hits.
2. Has unique letters (no duplicates) to test more letters at once.
3. Includes a mix of vowels and consonants.

Based on common Wordle starting strategies, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are often effective. I'll select ""CRANE"" because:
- It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, allowing me to check five different letters at once.
- It provides a balanced structure for positional testing.

This choice should give solid initial feedback to build upon in subsequent guesses.
</thinking>

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the word.
 R(-) -> R is in the word but not in the second position.
 A(-) -> A is in the word but not in the third position.
 N(x) -> N is not in the word.
 E(x) -> E is not in the word.

 So, we know:
 - The word contains R and A, but R is not in the second position and A is not in the third position.
 - The word does not contain C, N, or E.

 Since R and A are present, we need to include them in our next guess, but in different positions.

 Let's think about possible positions for R and A.
 - R was guessed in position 2, but it's not there. So R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. But note: the word has 5 positions.
 - A was guessed in position 3, but it's not there. So A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Also, we must avoid letters C, N, E (because they are not in the word).

 We can try to form a new word that includes R and A, in positions different from before, and using other common letters that haven't been tried yet.

 Some common letters to consider: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

 We should avoid repeating the same letters we already know are absent.

 Possible approach: 
 - Since R wasn't in position 2, let's try R in a position other than 2.
   For example, we might try R in position 1 or 4 or 5.
 - Similarly, A can be tried in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, but not 3.

 We also want to test new letters.

 Let's consider a word that has:
 - R in a new position, say position 1: then we'd have R _ _ _ _
 - But note: we must also have A somewhere. So we could put A in position 2? But position 2 is available for A because in the first guess position 3 was wrong for A and position 2 was R which we know is not the case now.

 However, we must not put R in position 2 again? Actually, the game doesn't forbid that, but we know R is not in position 2, so we avoid it.

 Let me sketch a word: 
 Option: Start with R? Then we have R in position 1. Then we can put A in position 2? But wait: the feedback for the previous A was that it's in the word but not in position 3. It might be in position 2. So let's try that.

 Word: R A _ _ _

 Then we need three more letters. We must avoid C, N, E. Also, common letters: T, S, L, etc.

 But note: we are guessing a full word. Let's try ""RATIO""?

 ""RATIO"": 
 - R in position 1: if the word has R in position 1, it would be correct. But we don't know that yet. Our previous feedback only tells us R is in the word, not which position. So we are testing position 1 for R.
 - A in position 2: similarly, testing if A is in position 2.
 - T, I, O are new letters.

 Alternatively, we might want to avoid using too many vowels? But let's see the letter distribution.

 Another common word: ""ROAST"", but we have S and T available. However, note we must avoid E (present in roast? wait no, E is avoided). ROAST: R, O, A, S, T.

 But let's check positions:
 - R in position 1: same as above.
 - O in position 2: new.
 - A in position 3: wait, in the first guess we learned that A is not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3, that would be a mistake? Actually, we know A is not in position 3 from the first feedback. So we must put A in a different position: not position 3. Therefore, ""ROAST"" puts A in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

 How about ""RASTA""? Not a word.

 How about ""RALLY""? But L might be an option? But in ""RALLY"": 
 - Position 1: R
 - Position 2: A
 - Position 3: L
 - Position 4: L -> duplicate letter. Also, we are avoiding duplicates? Not necessarily, but usually it's better to have distinct letters to gain more information.

 However, note the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't know. So for maximum information, distinct letters are better.

 So let's aim for distinct letters.

 Word: R A _ _ _

 We need three letters. We have many possibilities.

 Possibilities: 
 - R A T I O -> ""RATIO""
 - R A I S E -> but E is absent, so avoid.
 - R A I S T -> ""RAITS"" not a word.
 - R A S P Y -> ""RASPY"": contains S, P, Y.

 Another: R A D A R -> duplicate and not distinct.

 How about ""RAPID""? 
 - R in 1
 - A in 2
 - P in 3
 - I in 4
 - D in 5

 And we haven't tried P, I, D.

 Similarly, ""RALLY"" has duplicate L.

 What about ""RUSTS""? duplicate S and we know S?

 Actually, let's check common words.

 Let me fix R in position 1 and A in position 2? But wait, what if the R is not in position 1? Then we might get wrong feedback. But we need to test.

 Alternative: put R and A in positions we haven't tested. For example, put R in position 4 and A in position 5? Then we can use a word that ends with ""RA"". But that might be less common.

 Since we don't know the positions, it's better to choose a word that puts R and A in different positions and uses other common letters.

 Considering the feedback, let me think of words that:
 - Include R and A (must include them)
 - Exclude C, E, N
 - Put R not in position 2 and A not in position 3.

 So for R: possible positions: 1, 3, 4, 5
 For A: possible positions: 1, 2, 4, 5

 We have two known letters and three unknown.

 Another candidate: ""PARTY""
 - P: new
 - A: in position 2? 
 - R: in position 3? because we know R is not in position 2, so position 3 is new? 
 Actually, in ""PARTY"": 
   P in 1
   A in 2
   R in 3
   T in 4
   Y in 5

 This satisfies:
 - R is in position 3 (which is new) -> testing R in position 3
 - A is in position 2 (which is new for A) -> testing A in position 2
 - We avoid positions that we know are wrong: A is not in position 3 (and here we have A in 2 which is okay) and R is not in position 2 (we have R in 3).

 Also, we introduce P, T, Y.

 Another candidate: ""TRAIN""
 - T in 1
 - R in 2 -> but we know R is not in position 2! So this is invalid because we are putting R in the same wrong position? No, wait: we know from the feedback that R is in the word but not in position 2. Therefore, we must avoid placing R in position 2 again. So ""TRAIN"" has R in position 2 -> we should exclude this guess? Actually, we can still put it, but it would be inefficient because we know R isn't there. So better avoid.

 Thus, ""PARTY"" seems a good choice.

 However, note in ""PARTY"": 
 Position 1: P -> if we put A in position 1? But we don't have A in position 1 here. And R in position 3.

 But in the first guess, we didn't test position 1 at all? We had ""crane"": position 1 was C (absent), so we don't know about position 1.

 But we need to test valid words.

 Let me think if there is a better word.

 Another: ""ROBIN"" -> but O and B. However, in ""ROBIN"": 
 - R in position 1 -> okay
 - O in position 2 -> okay
 - B in position 3 -> okay
 - I in position 4 -> okay
 - N -> but N is absent! So we cannot use N. So avoid ""ROBIN"".

 Another: ""MAKER""
 - M in 1 -> okay
 - A in 2 -> okay (testing A in 2)
 - K in 3 -> okay
 - E in 4 -> but E is absent! So avoid.

 After considering alternatives, ""PARTY"" looks good.

 But what about ""PARTS""? 
 ""PARTS"": 
 - P in 1
 - A in 2
 - R in 3
 - T in 4
 - S in 5

 This also works. And S is a very common letter.

 Similarly, ""RANTS"" has N -> absent? So avoid.

 How about ""BARTS""? But B? And we don't know B? But note: we don't have any information about B. However, avoid because we are testing a small set? Actually, ""BARTS"" is not a common word. Let me check: BART? Not standard.

 Actually, ""PARTS"" is a word.

 But comparing ""PARTY"" vs ""PARTS"": 
 Both introduce P, A, R, T. One has T and S? ""PARTS"": P, A, R, T, S.

 Wait, ""PARTY"" has Y and ""PARTS"" has S. Both are common.

 How about ""RASPY""?
 ""RASPY"": 
 - R in 1
 - A in 2
 - S in 3
 - P in 4
 - Y in 5

 Also, avoids the forbidden positions: A is not in position 3 (we have A in 2) and R is not in position 2 (here R is in 1).

 And we introduce S, P, Y.

 I think ""RASPY"" is another candidate.

 But note: in the first guess, we didn't test position 3 with A? Actually we did (with ""crane"" position 3: A got '-', meaning A exists but not in that position). But ""RASPY"" has A in position 2: that's a testable position.

 Now, between ""PARTY"", ""PARTS"", and ""RASPY"", which gives more information? 
 - They all have R and A.
 - ""PARTY"" and ""PARTS"" (if chosen) only introduce one new vowel (if any) and consonants. Actually, ""PARTS"" doesn't have vowel besides A? But none of them has vowels except A? That's fine.

 Alternatively, we might want to test for vowels? But we already know E is absent. So O, I, U are vowels we haven't tested? Actually, we haven't tested O, I, U.

 In ""RATIO"": 
 - R in 1
 - A in 2
 - T in 3
 - I in 4
 - O in 5

 This introduces T, I, O. And we test A in position 2 and R in position 1.

 Importantly, it tests two new vowels: I and O.

 But note: we haven't tested any vowels except A? And A we know is present. The others? Not yet.

 First guess ""crane"" had A and E. We know E is absent. So O, I, U are still possibilities.

 Therefore, ""RATIO"" might be better because it tests two common vowels.

 And it avoids: C, N, E.

 So let's go with ""RATIO"".

 Structure:
 Position 1: R -> testing position 1 for R? (previously R was in position 2, which didn't work)
 Position 2: A -> testing position 2 for A? (previously A was in position 3, which didn't work)
 Position 3: T -> new letter, new position
 Position 4: I -> new letter
 Position 5: O -> new letter

 If the feedback shows:
 - R in position 1: correct? Then we know part of the word.
 - Or maybe only a minus? Then we know it's somewhere else.

 Similarly for A.

 So I think ""RATIO"" is a strong candidate.

 But what if the word doesn't have T, I, or O? We might get x's and narrow down.

 Therefore, I choose ""RATIO"".### Step-by-Step Thought Process:
- **Analyze previous feedback**:  
  The first guess for ""crane"" received:  
  - C: ❌ (not in the word)  
  - R: ➖ (in the word, wrong position)  
  - A: ➖ (in the word, wrong position)  
  - N: ❌ (not in the word)  
  - E: ❌ (not in the word)  
  
- **Key deductions**:  
  - The secret word contains **R** and **A**, but neither is in the guessed position (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).  
  - Letters **C, N, E** are absent and must be excluded from future guesses.  
  - Possible positions for R: 1, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is eliminated).  
  - Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is eliminated).  

- **Strategy for second guess**:  
  - Must reuse confirmed letters **R** and **A** in new positions.  
  - Avoid eliminated letters (**C, N, E**).  
  - Include new common letters (e.g., T, I, O, S) to maximize information gain.  
  - Prioritize distinct letters to test more characters.  
  - Strong candidates:  
    - ""**RATIO**"" tests R in position 1 (new), A in position 2 (new), and introduces T, I, O (all high-frequency letters).  
    - Alternatives like ""PARTY"" or ""RASPY"" were considered but ""RATIO"" provides broader vowel/consonant coverage.  

- **Why ""RATIO""?**  
  - Positions comply with feedback: R not in 2, A not in 3.  
  - Introduces 3 new untested letters (**T, I, O**).  
  - Common word structure increases the probability of positional hits.

<guess>ratio</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, wrong position)
  A: - (in word, wrong position)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""ratio""
  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> so R is in the word but not in position 1 (since we tried position 1 now) and not in position 2 (from first guess)
  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word but not in position 2 (tried now) and not in position 3 (from first guess)
  T: x (not in word)
  I: x (not in word)
  O: x (not in word)

So now we know:
- The word contains R and A, but not in positions 1,2 (for R) and not in positions 2,3 (for A). 
  Therefore, possible positions for R: 3, 4, 5 (since positions 1 and 2 are eliminated)
  Possible positions for A: 1, 4, 5 (positions 2 and 3 are eliminated)

- Additionally, we know the word does NOT contain: C, N, E, T, I, O.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, I, O. So we should avoid these except R and A which are present.

We need to form a new word that:
- Includes R and A (must include them because they are present)
- Avoids C, N, E, T, I, O (absent letters)
- Places R in one of the possible positions: 3, 4, or 5
- Places A in one of the possible positions: 1, 4, or 5 (but note: if we put A in 4 or 5, and R in 4 or 5, they might conflict? But they can be in the same word? Only if the word has duplicate letters? But we don't know. We must consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but for now, we assume distinct until proven otherwise? Actually, we don't have evidence of duplicates, so we try distinct.

We also want to test new common letters to get more information.

Common letters left: S, L, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, etc.

We have 3 positions to fill (besides R and A) and we need to choose letters that are common and not yet tested.

Let's list the positions and assign:

We know:
- Position 1: cannot be R (from guess2) and cannot be A? Actually, A can be in position 1. But we don't know. Similarly, position 2: cannot be A (from guess2) and cannot be R (from guess1). So position 2 must be a new letter.

Possible positions for A: 1,4,5
Possible positions for R: 3,4,5

We must assign R and A to two of these positions without conflict? But they could be in the same position? No, because they are different letters. So they must be in different positions.

So the positions for R and A must be two distinct positions from {1,4,5} for A and {3,4,5} for R. The overlapping position is 4 and 5. So they can both be in 4 and 5? But that would require the word to have two of the same position? No, we assign one letter per position.

So the possible pairs (A position, R position) are:
- A in 1, R in 3
- A in 1, R in 4
- A in 1, R in 5
- A in 4, R in 3
- A in 4, R in 5
- A in 5, R in 3
- A in 5, R in 4

But note: if we put A in 4 and R in 4, that's impossible. So we must choose different positions.

So the valid pairs are all except when both are in the same position.

Now, we also have to fill the other three positions with new letters.

We need to pick a word that fits one of these patterns and uses new letters.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: A in position 1, R in position 3.
Then the word: A _ R _ _
We need to fill positions 2,4,5 with new letters (avoiding C,N,E,T,I,O).

Possible words: 
- A U R A (but duplicate A? and we don't know if duplicates are allowed) -> avoid duplicates for now.
- A L R ? ? 
  - ""ALARM"" -> but has A again and M? But we don't know if A is duplicated? Also, M is new. But ""ALARM"" has two A's? So if the word has duplicate A, it's possible. But we don't have evidence. Let's avoid for now and try distinct.
- ""ALERT"" -> but E and T are absent -> invalid.
- ""ALBUM"" -> but B, U, M. But ""ALBUM"" has A in 1, L in 2, B in 3? But we need R in 3. So not.

Actually, with A in 1 and R in 3: A _ R _ _
We need a word: 
Position 2: must be a consonant? Let's try S: A S R _ _ -> ""ASSAY"" has duplicate S? and Y. But ""ASSAY"" is A S S A Y -> duplicates and A again. Not good.

Another: ""AWRY"" -> too short.

Hard to find. Maybe this pattern is less common.

Option 2: A in 1, R in 4.
Word: A _ _ R _
We need to fill positions 2,3,5.

Possible: 
- ""A P R I C"" -> but I and C are absent -> invalid.
- ""A P R O D"" -> O absent.
- ""A D R I P"" -> I absent.

With new letters: 
- ""A D R U M"" -> A, D, R, U, M -> ""ADRUM""? Not a word.
- ""A M B R Y"" -> ""AMBRY"" is a word? It means a storage place. But let's see: A in 1, M in 2, B in 3, R in 4, Y in 5. And we avoid absent letters. So ""AMBRY"" is acceptable? But it's uncommon.

Option 3: A in 1, R in 5.
Word: A _ _ _ R
Examples: ""A P P L Y"" -> duplicate P -> avoid.
"" A B U S R"" -> not a word.

"" A F T E R"" -> E and T absent -> invalid.

"" A L A R M"" -> duplicate A -> avoid.

"" A Z U R E"" -> E absent -> invalid.

Not easy.

Option 4: A in 4, R in 3.
Word: _ _ R A _
We need to fill positions 1,2,5.

This pattern is common? 
- ""B R A V O"" -> O absent -> invalid.
- ""D R A M A"" -> duplicate A -> avoid.
- ""P R A M S"" -> ""PRAMS"" is a word? P in 1, R in 2? But wait: we have R in position 3? No, in this pattern: position 3 is R and position 4 is A. So the word: _ _ R A _ 
So position 1 and 2 and 5.

Example: ""P U R A L"" -> ""PURAL""? Not a word.
"" F R A C T"" -> C and T absent -> invalid.
"" B R A V E"" -> E absent -> invalid.

But note: we can use S, L, etc.

"" S U R A L"" -> ""SURAL"" is an adjective relating to the calf of the leg. It's a word. 
S in 1, U in 2, R in 3, A in 4, L in 5. 
And we avoid absent letters: S, U, L are new and not in the absent list.

So ""SURAL"" is a candidate.

Option 5: A in 4, R in 5.
Word: _ _ _ A R
We need to fill positions 1,2,3.

Example: ""L A R A R"" -> duplicate -> avoid.
"" S C A R R"" -> duplicate R and C absent -> invalid.
"" D E A R "" -> too short.

"" U L N A R"" -> ""ULNAR"" is a word (relating to the ulna). 
U in 1, L in 2, N in 3? But N is absent -> invalid.

"" R A D A R"" -> duplicate and R in 1? But we are putting R in 5? And A in 4? So ""RADAR"" would be R in 1, A in 2, D in 3, A in 4, R in 5 -> duplicates and also we are putting R in 1 which we know is not allowed? Because from guess2, R is not in position 1. So we cannot put R in 1.

So we must avoid position 1 for R.

Therefore, in this pattern, position 1 must not be R. So we need a word: _ _ _ A R, with the first three positions being new letters and not R.

Example: ""P L A Y R"" -> not a word.
"" S H A R R"" -> duplicate R -> avoid.

"" L A P S R"" -> not a word.

Hard.

Option 6: A in 5, R in 3.
Word: _ _ R _ A
We need to fill positions 1,2,4.

Example: ""B A R B A"" -> duplicate -> avoid.
"" C A R T A"" -> duplicate A and C absent -> invalid.
"" P A R L A"" -> duplicate A -> avoid.

"" U R B A N"" -> N absent -> invalid.

"" B U R L A"" -> ""BURLA"" is not a word? 
"" B U R S A"" -> ""BURSA"" is a word (a sac in the body). 
B in 1, U in 2, R in 3, S in 4, A in 5. 
This avoids absent letters: B, U, S are new. 
So ""BURSA"" is a candidate.

Option 7: A in 5, R in 4.
Word: _ _ _ R A
We need to fill positions 1,2,3.

Example: ""O P E R A"" -> O and E absent -> invalid.
"" U L T R A"" -> U, L, T -> but T is absent -> invalid.
"" E X T R A"" -> E and T absent -> invalid.

"" S U P R A"" -> S, U, P -> ""SUPRA"" is a word (meaning above). 
S in 1, U in 2, P in 3, R in 4, A in 5. 
This uses new letters and avoids absent ones. 
So ""SUPRA"" is a candidate.

Now, we have a few candidates:
- From option4: ""SURAL"" (if we put A in 4 and R in 3)
- From option6: ""BURSA"" (A in 5, R in 3)
- From option7: ""SUPRA"" (A in 5, R in 4)

We also had ""AMBRY"" from option2? But it's uncommon.

We need to choose one that tests new common letters.

Let's list the new letters each candidate uses:
- ""SURAL"": S, U, L
- ""BURSA"": B, U, S (but note: S is in both, and U is in both? Actually, ""BURSA"" has B, U, R, S, A -> R and A are known, so new are B, U, S)
- ""SUPRA"": S, U, P, R, A -> new: S, U, P

All are testing S and U. Then ""SURAL"" tests L, ""BURSA"" tests B, ""SUPRA"" tests P.

Common letters: S is very common, then U, P, L, B.

We want to maximize information. Since we have three positions to fill, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

But note: in ""BURSA"", the letter S is in position 4? And in ""SURAL"", S is in position 1. In ""SUPRA"", S is in position 1.

Also, we are testing different positions for R and A.

We must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence, so we assume distinct.

I think ""SUPRA"" is a good choice because:
- It tests R in position 4 (which is a possible position) and A in position 5 (also possible).
- It uses common letters: S, U, P.

But let's check the pattern: _ _ _ R A -> positions 1,2,3 are S, U, P.

We haven't tested position 1,2,3 with these letters.

Alternatively, ""SURAL"" tests R in position 3 and A in position 4, which are also possible.

But ""SUPRA"" might be more common? And it has P which is a common consonant.

Another candidate: what about ""PURDA"" (a veil)? But ""PURDA"" has P, U, R, D, A -> and D is new. But ""PURDA"" is not very common.

We might also consider ""SURLY"", but Y is new? But ""SURLY"" has S, U, R, L, Y. But in ""SURLY"": 
- S in 1, U in 2, R in 3, L in 4, Y in 5.
But we are testing A? We must include A! ""SURLY"" doesn't have A. So we cannot use it because we must include A.

Similarly, we must include both R and A.

So back to the candidates.

I think ""SUPRA"" is a valid word and tests new letters.

But let me confirm: 
- We are putting R in position 4: which is a possible position (from the allowed 3,4,5) and we haven't tested position 4 for R before? 
  In guess1, R was in position 2 -> not there.
  In guess2, R was in position 1 -> not there.
  So position 4 is new for R.
- A in position 5: 
  In guess1, A was in position 3 -> not there.
  In guess2, A was in position 2 -> not there.
  So position 5 is new for A.

And we are testing S in position 1, U in position 2, P in position 3.

So I think ""SUPRA"" is a good guess.

But note: ""SUPRA"" is a valid English word (used as a prefix or standalone meaning above).

Therefore, I choose ""SUPRA"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"") Feedback**:  
  - C: ❌ (absent)  
  - R: ➖ (present, wrong position)  
  - A: ➖ (present, wrong position)  
  - N: ❌ (absent)  
  - E: ❌ (absent)  
- **Guess 2 (""ratio"") Feedback**:  
  - R: ➖ (present, wrong position)  
  - A: ➖ (present, wrong position)  
  - T: ❌ (absent)  
  - I: ❌ (absent)  
  - O: ❌ (absent)  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed Letters**:  
   - **R** and **A** are in the word but not in the positions guessed:  
     - R is **not** in position 1 (tested in ""ratio"") or 2 (tested in ""crane"").  
     - A is **not** in position 2 (tested in ""ratio"") or 3 (tested in ""crane"").  
   - Possible positions for R: **3, 4, or 5**.  
   - Possible positions for A: **1, 4, or 5**.  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   - C, N, E, T, I, O are **not in the word**. Avoid reusing these.  

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Must include **R** and **A** in new positions (not 1/2 for R, not 2/3 for A).  
   - Use new high-frequency letters (e.g., S, U, P, L, B) to maximize information.  
   - Prioritize testing R in position 4 or 5 and A in position 1, 4, or 5 (without conflicting positions).  
   - After evaluating options like ""SURAL"" (A in 4, R in 3) and ""BURSA"" (A in 5, R in 3), **""SUPRA""** was selected because:  
     - Puts R in position 4 (untested position).  
     - Puts A in position 5 (untested position).  
     - Introduces new common letters: **S** (position 1), **U** (position 2), **P** (position 3).  
     - Avoids duplicate letters and absent letters.

So R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. But note: the word has 5 positions.\n - A was guessed in position 3, but it\'s not there.

So we could put A in position 2? But position 2 is available for A because in the first guess position 3 was wrong for A and position 2 was R which we know is not the case now.\n\n However, we must not put R in position 2 again? Actually, the game doesn\'t forbid that, but we know R is not in position 2, so we avoid it.\n\n Let me sketch a word: \n Option: Start with R? Then we have R in position 1. Then we can put A in position 2? But wait: the feedback for the previous A was that it\'s in the word but not in position 3. It might be in position 2. So let\'s try that.\n\n Word: R A _ _ _\n\n Then we need three more letters. We must avoid C, N, E. Also, common letters: T, S, L, etc.\n\n But note: we are guessing a full word. Let\'s try ""RATIO""?\n\n ""RATIO"": \n - R in position 1: if the word has R in position 1, it would be correct. But we don\'t know that yet. Our previous feedback only tells us R is in the word, not which position. So we are testing position 1 for R.\n - A in position 2: similarly, testing if A is in position 2.\n - T, I, O are new letters.\n\n Alternatively, we might want to avoid using too many vowels? But let\'s see the letter distribution.\n\n Another common word: ""ROAST"", but we have S and T available. However, note we must avoid E (present in roast? wait no, E is avoided). ROAST: R, O, A, S, T.\n\n But let\'s check positions:\n - R in position 1: same as above.\n - O in position 2: new.\n - A in position 3: wait, in the first guess we learned that A is not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3, that would be a mistake? Actually, we know A is not in position 3 from the first feedback. So we must put A in a different position: not position 3. Therefore, ""ROAST"" puts A in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.\n\n How about ""RASTA""? Not a word.\n\n How about ""RALLY""? But L might be an option? But in ""RALLY"": \n - Position 1: R\n - Position 2: A\n - Position 3: L\n - Position 4: L -> duplicate letter. Also, we are avoiding duplicates? Not necessarily, but usually it\'s better to have distinct letters to gain more information.\n\n However, note the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t know. So for maximum information, distinct letters are better.\n\n So let\'s aim for distinct letters.\n\n Word: R A _ _ _\n\n We need three letters. We have many possibilities.\n\n Possibilities: \n - R A T I O -> ""RATIO""\n - R A I S E -> but E is absent, so avoid.\n - R A I S T -> ""RAITS"" not a word.\n - R A S P Y -> ""RASPY"": contains S, P, Y.\n\n Another: R A D A R -> duplicate and not distinct.\n\n How about ""RAPID""? \n - R in 1\n - A in 2\n - P in 3\n - I in 4\n - D in 5\n\n And we haven\'t tried P, I, D.\n\n Similarly, ""RALLY"" has duplicate L.\n\n What about ""RUSTS""? duplicate S and we know S?\n\n Actually, let\'s check common words.\n\n Let me fix R in position 1 and A in position 2? But wait, what if the R is not in position 1? Then we might get wrong feedback. But we need to test.\n\n Alternative: put R and A in positions we haven\'t tested. For example, put R in position 4 and A in position 5? Then we can use a word that ends with ""RA"". But that might be less common.\n\n Since we don\'t know the positions, it\'s better to choose a word that puts R and A in different positions and uses other common letters.\n\n Considering the feedback, let me think of words that:\n - Include R and A (must include them)\n - Exclude C, E, N\n - Put R not in position 2 and A not in position 3.\n\n So for R: possible positions: 1, 3, 4, 5\n For A: possible positions: 1, 2, 4, 5\n\n We have two known letters and three unknown.\n\n Another candidate: ""PARTY""\n - P: new\n - A: in position 2? \n - R: in position 3? because we know R is not in position 2, so position 3 is new? \n Actually, in ""PARTY"": \n   P in 1\n   A in 2\n   R in 3\n   T in 4\n   Y in 5\n\n This satisfies:\n - R is in position 3 (which is new) -> testing R in position 3\n - A is in position 2 (which is new for A) -> testing A in position 2\n - We avoid positions that we know are wrong: A is not in position 3 (and here we have A in 2 which is okay) and R is not in position 2 (we have R in 3).\n\n Also, we introduce P, T, Y.\n\n Another candidate: ""TRAIN""\n - T in 1\n - R in 2 -> but we know R is not in position 2! So this is invalid because we are putting R in the same wrong position? No, wait: we know from the feedback that R is in the word but not in position 2. Therefore, we must avoid placing R in position 2 again. So ""TRAIN"" has R in position 2 -> we should exclude this guess? Actually, we can still put it, but it would be inefficient because we know R isn\'t there. So better avoid.\n\n Thus, ""PARTY"" seems a good choice.\n\n However, note in ""PARTY"": \n Position 1: P -> if we put A in position 1? But we don\'t have A in position 1 here. And R in position 3.\n\n But in the first guess, we didn\'t test position 1 at all? We had ""crane"": position 1 was C (absent), so we don\'t know about position 1.\n\n But we need to test valid words.\n\n Let me think if there is a better word.\n\n Another: ""ROBIN"" -> but O and B. However, in ""ROBIN"": \n - R in position 1 -> okay\n - O in position 2 -> okay\n - B in position 3 -> okay\n - I in position 4 -> okay\n - N -> but N is absent! So we cannot use N. So avoid ""ROBIN"".\n\n Another: ""MAKER""\n - M in 1 -> okay\n - A in 2 -> okay (testing A in 2)\n - K in 3 -> okay\n - E in 4 -> but E is absent! So avoid.\n\n After considering alternatives, ""PARTY"" looks good.\n\n But what about ""PARTS""? \n ""PARTS"": \n - P in 1\n - A in 2\n - R in 3\n - T in 4\n - S in 5\n\n This also works. And S is a very common letter.\n\n Similarly, ""RANTS"" has N -> absent? So avoid.\n\n How about ""BARTS""? But B? And we don\'t know B? But note: we don\'t have any information about B. However, avoid because we are testing a small set? Actually, ""BARTS"" is not a common word. Let me check: BART? Not standard.\n\n Actually, ""PARTS"" is a word.\n\n But comparing ""PARTY"" vs ""PARTS"": \n Both introduce P, A, R, T. One has T and S? ""PARTS"": P, A, R, T, S.\n\n Wait, ""PARTY"" has Y and ""PARTS"" has S. Both are common.\n\n How about ""RASPY""?\n ""RASPY"": \n - R in 1\n - A in 2\n - S in 3\n - P in 4\n - Y in 5\n\n Also, avoids the forbidden positions: A is not in position 3 (we have A in 2) and R is not in position 2 (here R is in 1).\n\n And we introduce S, P, Y.\n\n I think ""RASPY"" is another candidate.\n\n But note: in the first guess, we didn\'t test position 3 with A? Actually we did (with ""crane"" position 3: A got \'-\', meaning A exists but not in that position). But ""RASPY"" has A in position 2: that\'s a testable position.\n\n Now, between ""PARTY"", ""PARTS"", and ""RASPY"", which gives more information? \n - They all have R and A.\n - ""PARTY"" and ""PARTS"" (if chosen) only introduce one new vowel (if any) and consonants. Actually, ""PARTS"" doesn\'t have vowel besides A? But none of them has vowels except A? That\'s fine.\n\n Alternatively, we might want to test for vowels? But we already know E is absent. So O, I, U are vowels we haven\'t tested? Actually, we haven\'t tested O, I, U.\n\n In ""RATIO"": \n - R in 1\n - A in 2\n - T in 3\n - I in 4\n - O in 5\n\n This introduces T, I, O. And we test A in position 2 and R in position 1.\n\n Importantly, it tests two new vowels: I and O.\n\n But note: we haven\'t tested any vowels except A? And A we know is present. The others? Not yet.\n\n First guess ""crane"" had A and E. We know E is absent. So O, I, U are still possibilities.\n\n Therefore, ""RATIO"" might be better because it tests two common vowels.\n\n And it avoids: C, N, E.\n\n So let\'s go with ""RATIO"".\n\n Structure:\n Position 1: R -> testing position 1 for R? (previously R was in position 2, which didn\'t work)\n Position 2: A -> testing position 2 for A? (previously A was in position 3, which didn\'t work)\n Position 3: T -> new letter, new position\n Position 4: I -> new letter\n Position 5: O -> new letter\n\n If the feedback shows:\n - R in position 1: correct? Then we know part of the word.\n - Or maybe only a minus? Then we know it\'s somewhere else.\n\n Similarly for A.\n\n So I think ""RATIO"" is a strong candidate.\n\n But what if the word doesn\'t have T, I, or O? We might get x\'s and narrow down.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""RATIO"".### Step-by-Step Thought Process:\n- **Analyze previous feedback**:  \n  The first guess for ""crane"" received:  \n  - C: ❌ (not in the word)  \n  - R: ➖ (in the word, wrong position)  \n  - A: ➖ (in the word, wrong position)  \n  - N: ❌ (not in the word)  \n  - E: ❌ (not in the word)  \n  \n- **Key deductions**:  \n  - The secret word contains **R** and **A**, but neither is in the guessed position (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).  \n  - Letters **C, N, E** are absent and must be excluded from future guesses.  \n  - Possible positions for R: 1, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is eliminated).  \n  - Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is eliminated).  \n\n- **Strategy for second guess**:  \n  - Must reuse confirmed letters **R** and **A** in new positions.  \n  - Avoid eliminated letters (**C, N, E**).  \n  - Include new common letters (e.g., T, I, O, S) to maximize information gain.  \n  - Prioritize distinct letters to test more characters.  \n  - Strong candidates:  \n    - ""**RATIO**"" tests R in position 1 (new), A in position 2 (new), and introduces T, I, O (all high-frequency letters).  \n    - Alternatives like ""PARTY"" or ""RASPY"" were considered but ""RATIO"" provides broader vowel/consonant coverage.  \n\n- **Why ""RATIO""?**  \n  - Positions comply with feedback: R not in 2, A not in 3.  \n  - Introduces 3 new untested letters (**T, I, O**).  \n  - Common word structure increases the probability of positional hits.\n\n<guess>ratio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in word)\n  R: - (in word, wrong position)\n  A: - (in word, wrong position)\n  N: x (not in word)\n  E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: ""ratio""\n  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> so R is in the word but not in position 1 (since we tried position 1 now) and not in position 2 (from first guess)\n  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word but not in position 2 (tried now) and not in position 3 (from first guess)\n  T: x (not in word)\n  I: x (not in word)\n  O: x (not in word)\n\nSo now we know:\n- The word contains R and A, but not in positions 1,2 (for R) and not in positions 2,3 (for A). \n  Therefore, possible positions for R: 3, 4, 5 (since positions 1 and 2 are eliminated)\n  Possible positions for A: 1, 4, 5 (positions 2 and 3 are eliminated)\n\n- Additionally, we know the word does NOT contain: C, N, E, T, I, O.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, I, O. So we should avoid these except R and A which are present.\n\nWe need to form a new word that:\n- Includes R and A (must include them because they are present)\n- Avoids C, N, E, T, I, O (absent letters)\n- Places R in one of the possible positions: 3, 4, or 5\n- Places A in one of the possible positions: 1, 4, or 5 (but note: if we put A in 4 or 5, and R in 4 or 5, they might conflict? But they can be in the same word? Only if the word has duplicate letters? But we don\'t know. We must consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but for now, we assume distinct until proven otherwise? Actually, we don\'t have evidence of duplicates, so we try distinct.\n\nWe also want to test new common letters to get more information.\n\nCommon letters left: S, L, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, etc.\n\nWe have 3 positions to fill (besides R and A) and we need to choose letters that are common and not yet tested.\n\nLet\'s list the positions and assign:\n\nWe know:\n- Position 1: cannot be R (from guess2) and cannot be A? Actually, A can be in position 1. But we don\'t know. Similarly, position 2: cannot be A (from guess2) and cannot be R (from guess1). So position 2 must be a new letter.\n\nPossible positions for A: 1,4,5\nPossible positions for R: 3,4,5\n\nWe must assign R and A to two of these positions without conflict? But they could be in the same position? No, because they are different letters. So they must be in different positions.\n\nSo the positions for R and A must be two distinct positions from {1,4,5} for A and {3,4,5} for R. The overlapping position is 4 and 5. So they can both be in 4 and 5? But that would require the word to have two of the same position? No, we assign one letter per position.\n\nSo the possible pairs (A position, R position) are:\n- A in 1, R in 3\n- A in 1, R in 4\n- A in 1, R in 5\n- A in 4, R in 3\n- A in 4, R in 5\n- A in 5, R in 3\n- A in 5, R in 4\n\nBut note: if we put A in 4 and R in 4, that\'s impossible. So we must choose different positions.\n\nSo the valid pairs are all except when both are in the same position.\n\nNow, we also have to fill the other three positions with new letters.\n\nWe need to pick a word that fits one of these patterns and uses new letters.\n\nLet\'s try to form words:\n\nOption 1: A in position 1, R in position 3.\nThen the word: A _ R _ _\nWe need to fill positions 2,4,5 with new letters (avoiding C,N,E,T,I,O).\n\nPossible words: \n- A U R A (but duplicate A? and we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed) -> avoid duplicates for now.\n- A L R ? ? \n  - ""ALARM"" -> but has A again and M? But we don\'t know if A is duplicated? Also, M is new. But ""ALARM"" has two A\'s? So if the word has duplicate A, it\'s possible. But we don\'t have evidence. Let\'s avoid for now and try distinct.\n- ""ALERT"" -> but E and T are absent -> invalid.\n- ""ALBUM"" -> but B, U, M. But ""ALBUM"" has A in 1, L in 2, B in 3? But we need R in 3. So not.\n\nActually, with A in 1 and R in 3: A _ R _ _\nWe need a word: \nPosition 2: must be a consonant? Let\'s try S: A S R _ _ -> ""ASSAY"" has duplicate S? and Y. But ""ASSAY"" is A S S A Y -> duplicates and A again. Not good.\n\nAnother: ""AWRY"" -> too short.\n\nHard to find. Maybe this pattern is less common.\n\nOption 2: A in 1, R in 4.\nWord: A _ _ R _\nWe need to fill positions 2,3,5.\n\nPossible: \n- ""A P R I C"" -> but I and C are absent -> invalid.\n- ""A P R O D"" -> O absent.\n- ""A D R I P"" -> I absent.\n\nWith new letters: \n- ""A D R U M"" -> A, D, R, U, M -> ""ADRUM""? Not a word.\n- ""A M B R Y"" -> ""AMBRY"" is a word? It means a storage place. But let\'s see: A in 1, M in 2, B in 3, R in 4, Y in 5. And we avoid absent letters. So ""AMBRY"" is acceptable? But it\'s uncommon.\n\nOption 3: A in 1, R in 5.\nWord: A _ _ _ R\nExamples: ""A P P L Y"" -> duplicate P -> avoid.\n"" A B U S R"" -> not a word.\n\n"" A F T E R"" -> E and T absent -> invalid.\n\n"" A L A R M"" -> duplicate A -> avoid.\n\n"" A Z U R E"" -> E absent -> invalid.\n\nNot easy.\n\nOption 4: A in 4, R in 3.\nWord: _ _ R A _\nWe need to fill positions 1,2,5.\n\nThis pattern is common? \n- ""B R A V O"" -> O absent -> invalid.\n- ""D R A M A"" -> duplicate A -> avoid.\n- ""P R A M S"" -> ""PRAMS"" is a word? P in 1, R in 2? But wait: we have R in position 3? No, in this pattern: position 3 is R and position 4 is A. So the word: _ _ R A _ \nSo position 1 and 2 and 5.\n\nExample: ""P U R A L"" -> ""PURAL""? Not a word.\n"" F R A C T"" -> C and T absent -> invalid.\n"" B R A V E"" -> E absent -> invalid.\n\nBut note: we can use S, L, etc.\n\n"" S U R A L"" -> ""SURAL"" is an adjective relating to the calf of the leg. It\'s a word. \nS in 1, U in 2, R in 3, A in 4, L in 5. \nAnd we avoid absent letters: S, U, L are new and not in the absent list.\n\nSo ""SURAL"" is a candidate.\n\nOption 5: A in 4, R in 5.\nWord: _ _ _ A R\nWe need to fill positions 1,2,3.\n\nExample: ""L A R A R"" -> duplicate -> avoid.\n"" S C A R R"" -> duplicate R and C absent -> invalid.\n"" D E A R "" -> too short.\n\n"" U L N A R"" -> ""ULNAR"" is a word (relating to the ulna). \nU in 1, L in 2, N in 3? But N is absent -> invalid.\n\n"" R A D A R"" -> duplicate and R in 1? But we are putting R in 5? And A in 4? So ""RADAR"" would be R in 1, A in 2, D in 3, A in 4, R in 5 -> duplicates and also we are putting R in 1 which we know is not allowed? Because from guess2, R is not in position 1. So we cannot put R in 1.\n\nSo we must avoid position 1 for R.\n\nTherefore, in this pattern, position 1 must not be R. So we need a word: _ _ _ A R, with the first three positions being new letters and not R.\n\nExample: ""P L A Y R"" -> not a word.\n"" S H A R R"" -> duplicate R -> avoid.\n\n"" L A P S R"" -> not a word.\n\nHard.\n\nOption 6: A in 5, R in 3.\nWord: _ _ R _ A\nWe need to fill positions 1,2,4.\n\nExample: ""B A R B A"" -> duplicate -> avoid.\n"" C A R T A"" -> duplicate A and C absent -> invalid.\n"" P A R L A"" -> duplicate A -> avoid.\n\n"" U R B A N"" -> N absent -> invalid.\n\n"" B U R L A"" -> ""BURLA"" is not a word? \n"" B U R S A"" -> ""BURSA"" is a word (a sac in the body). \nB in 1, U in 2, R in 3, S in 4, A in 5. \nThis avoids absent letters: B, U, S are new. \nSo ""BURSA"" is a candidate.\n\nOption 7: A in 5, R in 4.\nWord: _ _ _ R A\nWe need to fill positions 1,2,3.\n\nExample: ""O P E R A"" -> O and E absent -> invalid.\n"" U L T R A"" -> U, L, T -> but T is absent -> invalid.\n"" E X T R A"" -> E and T absent -> invalid.\n\n"" S U P R A"" -> S, U, P -> ""SUPRA"" is a word (meaning above). \nS in 1, U in 2, P in 3, R in 4, A in 5. \nThis uses new letters and avoids absent ones. \nSo ""SUPRA"" is a candidate.\n\nNow, we have a few candidates:\n- From option4: ""SURAL"" (if we put A in 4 and R in 3)\n- From option6: ""BURSA"" (A in 5, R in 3)\n- From option7: ""SUPRA"" (A in 5, R in 4)\n\nWe also had ""AMBRY"" from option2? But it\'s uncommon.\n\nWe need to choose one that tests new common letters.\n\nLet\'s list the new letters each candidate uses:\n- ""SURAL"": S, U, L\n- ""BURSA"": B, U, S (but note: S is in both, and U is in both? Actually, ""BURSA"" has B, U, R, S, A -> R and A are known, so new are B, U, S)\n- ""SUPRA"": S, U, P, R, A -> new: S, U, P\n\nAll are testing S and U. Then ""SURAL"" tests L, ""BURSA"" tests B, ""SUPRA"" tests P.\n\nCommon letters: S is very common, then U, P, L, B.\n\nWe want to maximize information. Since we have three positions to fill, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\nBut note: in ""BURSA"", the letter S is in position 4? And in ""SURAL"", S is in position 1. In ""SUPRA"", S is in position 1.\n\nAlso, we are testing different positions for R and A.\n\nWe must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence, so we assume distinct.\n\nI think ""SUPRA"" is a good choice because:\n- It tests R in position 4 (which is a possible position) and A in position 5 (also possible).\n- It uses common letters: S, U, P.\n\nBut let\'s check the pattern: _ _ _ R A -> positions 1,2,3 are S, U, P.\n\nWe haven\'t tested position 1,2,3 with these letters.\n\nAlternatively, ""SURAL"" tests R in position 3 and A in position 4, which are also possible.\n\nBut ""SUPRA"" might be more common? And it has P which is a common consonant.\n\nAnother candidate: what about ""PURDA"" (a veil)? But ""PURDA"" has P, U, R, D, A -> and D is new. But ""PURDA"" is not very common.\n\nWe might also consider ""SURLY"", but Y is new? But ""SURLY"" has S, U, R, L, Y. But in ""SURLY"": \n- S in 1, U in 2, R in 3, L in 4, Y in 5.\nBut we are testing A? We must include A! ""SURLY"" doesn\'t have A. So we cannot use it because we must include A.\n\nSimilarly, we must include both R and A.\n\nSo back to the candidates.\n\nI think ""SUPRA"" is a valid word and tests new letters.\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- We are putting R in position 4: which is a possible position (from the allowed 3,4,5) and we haven\'t tested position 4 for R before? \n  In guess1, R was in position 2 -> not there.\n  In guess2, R was in position 1 -> not there.\n  So position 4 is new for R.\n- A in position 5: \n  In guess1, A was in position 3 -> not there.\n  In guess2, A was in position 2 -> not there.\n  So position 5 is new for A.\n\nAnd we are testing S in position 1, U in position 2, P in position 3.\n\nSo I think ""SUPRA"" is a good guess.\n\nBut note: ""SUPRA"" is a valid English word (used as a prefix or standalone meaning above).\n\nTherefore, I choose ""SUPRA"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"") Feedback**:  \n  - C: ❌ (absent)  \n  - R: ➖ (present, wrong position)  \n  - A: ➖ (present, wrong position)  \n  - N: ❌ (absent)  \n  - E: ❌ (absent)  \n- **Guess 2 (""ratio"") Feedback**:  \n  - R: ➖ (present, wrong position)  \n  - A: ➖ (present, wrong position)  \n  - T: ❌ (absent)  \n  - I: ❌ (absent)  \n  - O: ❌ (absent)  \n\n### Key Deductions:\n1. **Confirmed Letters**:  \n   - **R** and **A** are in the word but not in the positions guessed:  \n     - R is **not** in position 1 (tested in ""ratio"") or 2 (tested in ""crane"").  \n     - A is **not** in position 2 (tested in ""ratio"") or 3 (tested in ""crane"").  \n   - Possible positions for R: **3, 4, or 5**.  \n   - Possible positions for A: **1, 4, or 5**.  \n\n2. **Absent Letters**:  \n   - C, N, E, T, I, O are **not in the word**.

We have feedback from Guess 3 (""supra""):
- S: x -> S is not in the word.
- U: - -> U is in the word but not in position 2.
- P: x -> P is not in the word.
- R: ✓ -> R is in the word and in the correct position 4.
- A: ✓ -> A is in the word and in the correct position 5.

So we know:
- The word has R in position 4 and A in position 5: _ _ _ R A.
- U is in the word but not in position 2. Since position 4 is R and 5 is A, U must be in position 1 or 3.
- Letters S and P are absent (so avoid them).
- We also have previous feedback: C, N, E, T, I, O are absent (from guesses 1 and 2).

Therefore, the word format is: [pos1] [pos2] [pos3] R A.
- pos1 must be a letter that is not S, C, N, E, T, I, O, P (and not R or A because we already have them, and duplicates? But not necessarily, but since we have R and A fixed, and U is present, so pos1 could be U or another letter? Wait, we know U is in the word, and it could be in position 1 or 3.

We also know:
- U is present and not in position 2, so it must be in pos1 or pos3.

Now, we need to find a word that fits: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] R A.

Constraints:
- letter1, letter2, letter3 must be letters not excluded: not in (C, N, E, T, I, O, S, P). And they must be valid English letters.
- U must be in either letter1 or letter3.
- Also, we know from guess1 and guess2 that R and A were not in certain positions, but that is now satisfied by the current format.

Available letters: many consonants and vowels left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but some are uncommon).

We can break it down:

Case 1: U is in position 1. Then the word is: U _ _ R A.
- We need to fill position 2 and 3 with letters not excluded, and one of them must be? But we don't have any other known letter? Only that the word must be valid.

Case 2: U is in position 3. Then the word is: _ _ U R A.

We must guess using available letters.

List of common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, Y, etc.

We have two cases. We need to test both possibilities? But we must choose one word.

First, let's consider Case 1: U in position 1 -> U ? ? R A
- Position 2: must be a consonant? Or vowel? But we need English words.
- Position 3: same.

Possible words:
- U L T R A -> but T is absent -> invalid.
- U M B R A -> ""umbra""? U M B R A? But M and B are available? But does it have duplicates? We are using U, M, B, R, A? But we don't know about M and B yet. But wait: ""umbra"" has U in position 1? And we are using U? But we are putting U in position 1? Actually, ""umbra"": U, M, B, R, A? With positions: U in 1, M in 2, B in 3. And we have R in 4, A in 5.

So ""umbra"": 
- U in 1: if U is in the word, this tests it in position 1.
- M in 2
- B in 3

And avoids absent letters? M and B not absent? So yes.

But wait: we have U only once? Assuming no duplicate.

Another word: ""UKASE"" -> but E absent -> invalid.

"" U N B A R"" -> N absent -> invalid.

So ""umbra"" is a candidate.

Case 2: U in position 3 -> _ _ U R A
We need to fill position 1 and 2.

Possible: 
- L U R A M -> but M? And word: L U R A M -> position 5 is M? But we have A in position 5? Conflict? No: the word must end with RA? So _ _ U R A. So last two are R, A.

For example: ""bagura""? not a word.
"" B U R K A"" -> but K? And ""burqa""? I think it's ""burka"" but K is available? We can use. But ""burka"" has 5 letters: B U R K A? But we have R in 4? Position: B in 1, U in 2, R? But we are putting U in position 3? So no.

We have U in position 3: so letters: position 1, 2, then U in 3, R in 4, A in 5.

So word: ? ? U R A

Examples:
- ""H U R R A"" -> duplicate R -> avoid? We don't know if R can be duplicated? But in this case, we are only using R once in position 4. ""hurra"" has only one R? Actually not: H U R R A -> two R' s? So R is duplicated? Avoid for now.

- ""F L U R A"" -> ""flura""? Not a common word.
- ""M U R R A"" -> duplicate R -> avoid.

Common words: 
- ""DUSTY"" -> invalid.

Another: ""JUMAR""? J U M A R? But not standard.

"" C U R R A"" -> duplicate R and C absent -> invalid.

Hard to find.

Another candidate: ""BAURA""? B A U R A? But duplicate A and A is in position 2? But we are putting A only in position 5? So no.

Actually, we have U in position 3: 
- ""H U R A ""? Not 5 letters.

Words ending with URA? 
- ""DOURA"" -> but O absent -> invalid.
- ""SOURA"" -> S absent -> invalid.
- ""MOURA"" -> O absent -> invalid.
- ""GOURA"" -> O absent -> invalid.
- ""LAURA"" -> A and U? L in 1, A in 2? Then U in 3, R in 4, A in 5? But two A's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Let's check the possibility.

But in previous feedback, we haven't encountered duplicates? But the word might have duplicate letters. For example, if A appears twice? We don't know.

However, we know A is fixed in position 5. If we put A in position 2, it would be another occurrence? But we don't know if it's present elsewhere.

But let's see in our fixed pattern: we have A only at position 5. So if we use a word with A in position 2, it would be an additional A? But the feedback for ""supra"" said A is correct at position 5, but didn't say anything about other As? Actually, if there were two A's, we might get another symbol? But the feedback only marks each guessed position.

It's possible that the word has two A's. For example, ""LAURA"": 
- L in 1, A in 2, U in 3, R in 4, A in 5.

That would have duplicate A.

But in that case, for ""supra"": we guessed A in position 5 (correct), and we didn't guess a second A? So we wouldn't know.

Similarly, for the word ""LAURA"", we haven't tested position 2 for A? So it might be possible.

Moreover, in our feedback from guess1 and guess2, A was marked minuses in positions 3 and 2? But that doesn't rule out A being in other positions? Actually, it confirms that there is at least one A. But we don't know if there's more.

Therefore, we cannot rule out duplicates.

So for the case U in position 3: word: _ _ U R A
We can have A in other positions? But if we put A in position 2, it would be consistent? Only if the word has two A's.

But let's avoid complications and first try without duplicates since we haven't seen duplicates yet.

Back to candidate words.

Case 1: ""umbra"" (U in position 1) -> ""UMBRA"" is a valid word.

We can test U in position 1.

Case 2: U in position 3. Words without duplicates: 
- ""BLUMA""? ""Bluma"" not common.
- ""FLUMA"" not a word.
- ""GLUMA"" not common.
- ""KLUMA"" no.

But ""LAURA"" has duplicate A? And L and U: L in 1, A in 2? But then we avoid A in 2 because we are putting it? Actually, we are forced to use A at the end? So we have R and A fixed.

Perhaps ""MURA"" with letters? But 5 letters.

Another: ""BAUKS"" no.

I think ""umbra"" is a practical choice because it tests U in position 1 and introduces M and B.

If ""umbra"" is not the word, we get information about U's position.

Therefore, we choose ""umbra"".

But note: in ""umbra"", position 3 is B and position 2 is M.

And we have U in 1, M in 2, B in 3, R in 4, A in 5.

This assumes that U is in position 1. If U is actually in position 3, then ""umbra"" will show U as not correct? Actually, we get feedback.

So we'll know from the feedback.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  
   - C ❌ (absent)  
   - R ➖ (present, wrong position)  
   - A ➖ (present, wrong position)  
   - N ❌ (absent)  
   - E ❌ (absent)  

2. **Guess 2 (""ratio"")**:  
   - R ➖ (present, wrong position)  
   - A ➖ (present, wrong position)  
   - T ❌ (absent)  
   - I ❌ (absent)  
   - O ❌ (absent)  

3. **Guess 3 (""supra"")**:  
   - S ❌ (absent)  
   - U ➖ (present, wrong position)  
   - P ❌ (absent)  
   - R ✓ (correct position, position 4)  
   - A ✓ (correct position, position 5)  

### Key Deductions:
- **Fixed Positions**:  
  - **R** is in **position 4**.  
  - **A** is in **position 5**.  
  Thus, the secret word has the structure: `_ _ _ R A`.  

- **Confirmed Letters**:  
  - **U** is present ⚠️ but **not in position 2** (per ""supra"" feedback). Since positions 4–5 are fixed (R/A), U must be in **position 1 or 3**.  

- **Absent Letters**:  
  - Eliminated: `C, N, E, T, I, O, S, P`. Avoid these in future guesses.  

- **Available Letters**:  
  Focus on common letters not yet tested: `B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z`.  
  Prioritize `U` (must appear in position 1 or 3) and high-frequency consonants (e.g., `B, L, M`).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
Must reconcile U’s position and fill positions 1–3 with new letters:
- **Case 1 (U in position 1)**: Test a word like **""UMBRA""** (U in 1, M in 2, B in 3).  
- **Case 2 (U in position 3)**: Test a word like **""VULRA""** or **""BLURA""**, but no common word exists.  

**Chosen Guess: ""UMBRA""**  
- Tests **U in position 1** (directly resolving uncertainty).  
- Introduces **M** (position 2) and **B** (position 3)—high-frequency pending letters.  
- Valid word structure: `U M B R A`.  
- Avoids duplicates and excluded letters.  

<guess>umbra</guess>",umbra,"We have feedback from Guess 3 (""supra""):
- S: x -> S is not in the word.
- U: - -> U is in the word but not in position 2.
- P: x -> P is not in the word.
- R: ✓ -> R is in the word and in the correct position 4.
- A: ✓ -> A is in the word and in the correct position 5.

So we know:
- The word has R in position 4 and A in position 5: _ _ _ R A.
- U is in the word but not in position 2. Since position 4 is R and 5 is A, U must be in position 1 or 3.
- Letters S and P are absent (so avoid them).
- We also have previous feedback: C, N, E, T, I, O are absent (from guesses 1 and 2).

Therefore, the word format is: [pos1] [pos2] [pos3] R A.
- pos1 must be a letter that is not S, C, N, E, T, I, O, P (and not R or A because we already have them, and duplicates? But not necessarily, but since we have R and A fixed, and U is present, so pos1 could be U or another letter? Wait, we know U is in the word, and it could be in position 1 or 3.

We also know:
- U is present and not in position 2, so it must be in pos1 or pos3.

Now, we need to find a word that fits: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] R A.

Constraints:
- letter1, letter2, letter3 must be letters not excluded: not in (C, N, E, T, I, O, S, P). And they must be valid English letters.
- U must be in either letter1 or letter3.
- Also, we know from guess1 and guess2 that R and A were not in certain positions, but that is now satisfied by the current format.

Available letters: many consonants and vowels left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but some are uncommon).

We can break it down:

Case 1: U is in position 1. Then the word is: U _ _ R A.
- We need to fill position 2 and 3 with letters not excluded, and one of them must be? But we don't have any other known letter? Only that the word must be valid.

Case 2: U is in position 3. Then the word is: _ _ U R A.

We must guess using available letters.

List of common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, Y, etc.

We have two cases. We need to test both possibilities? But we must choose one word.

First, let's consider Case 1: U in position 1 -> U ? ? R A
- Position 2: must be a consonant? Or vowel? But we need English words.
- Position 3: same.

Possible words:
- U L T R A -> but T is absent -> invalid.
- U M B R A -> ""umbra""? U M B R A? But M and B are available? But does it have duplicates? We are using U, M, B, R, A? But we don't know about M and B yet. But wait: ""umbra"" has U in position 1? And we are using U? But we are putting U in position 1? Actually, ""umbra"": U, M, B, R, A? With positions: U in 1, M in 2, B in 3. And we have R in 4, A in 5.

So ""umbra"": 
- U in 1: if U is in the word, this tests it in position 1.
- M in 2
- B in 3

And avoids absent letters? M and B not absent? So yes.

But wait: we have U only once? Assuming no duplicate.

Another word: ""UKASE"" -> but E absent -> invalid.

"" U N B A R"" -> N absent -> invalid.

So ""umbra"" is a candidate.

Case 2: U in position 3 -> _ _ U R A
We need to fill position 1 and 2.

Possible: 
- L U R A M -> but M? And word: L U R A M -> position 5 is M? But we have A in position 5? Conflict? No: the word must end with RA? So _ _ U R A. So last two are R, A.

For example: ""bagura""? not a word.
"" B U R K A"" -> but K? And ""burqa""? I think it's ""burka"" but K is available? We can use. But ""burka"" has 5 letters: B U R K A? But we have R in 4? Position: B in 1, U in 2, R? But we are putting U in position 3? So no.

We have U in position 3: so letters: position 1, 2, then U in 3, R in 4, A in 5.

So word: ? ? U R A

Examples:
- ""H U R R A"" -> duplicate R -> avoid? We don't know if R can be duplicated? But in this case, we are only using R once in position 4. ""hurra"" has only one R? Actually not: H U R R A -> two R' s? So R is duplicated? Avoid for now.

- ""F L U R A"" -> ""flura""? Not a common word.
- ""M U R R A"" -> duplicate R -> avoid.

Common words: 
- ""DUSTY"" -> invalid.

Another: ""JUMAR""? J U M A R? But not standard.

"" C U R R A"" -> duplicate R and C absent -> invalid.

Hard to find.

Another candidate: ""BAURA""? B A U R A? But duplicate A and A is in position 2? But we are putting A only in position 5? So no.

Actually, we have U in position 3: 
- ""H U R A ""? Not 5 letters.

Words ending with URA? 
- ""DOURA"" -> but O absent -> invalid.
- ""SOURA"" -> S absent -> invalid.
- ""MOURA"" -> O absent -> invalid.
- ""GOURA"" -> O absent -> invalid.
- ""LAURA"" -> A and U? L in 1, A in 2? Then U in 3, R in 4, A in 5? But two A's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Let's check the possibility.

But in previous feedback, we haven't encountered duplicates? But the word might have duplicate letters. For example, if A appears twice? We don't know.

However, we know A is fixed in position 5. If we put A in position 2, it would be another occurrence? But we don't know if it's present elsewhere.

But let's see in our fixed pattern: we have A only at position 5. So if we use a word with A in position 2, it would be an additional A? But the feedback for ""supra"" said A is correct at position 5, but didn't say anything about other As? Actually, if there were two A's, we might get another symbol? But the feedback only marks each guessed position.

It's possible that the word has two A's. For example, ""LAURA"": 
- L in 1, A in 2, U in 3, R in 4, A in 5.

That would have duplicate A.

But in that case, for ""supra"": we guessed A in position 5 (correct), and we didn't guess a second A? So we wouldn't know.

Similarly, for the word ""LAURA"", we haven't tested position 2 for A? So it might be possible.

Moreover, in our feedback from guess1 and guess2, A was marked minuses in positions 3 and 2? But that doesn't rule out A being in other positions? Actually, it confirms that there is at least one A. But we don't know if there's more.

Therefore, we cannot rule out duplicates.

So for the case U in position 3: word: _ _ U R A
We can have A in other positions? But if we put A in position 2, it would be consistent? Only if the word has two A's.

But let's avoid complications and first try without duplicates since we haven't seen duplicates yet.

Back to candidate words.

Case 1: ""umbra"" (U in position 1) -> ""UMBRA"" is a valid word.

We can test U in position 1.

Case 2: U in position 3. Words without duplicates: 
- ""BLUMA""? ""Bluma"" not common.
- ""FLUMA"" not a word.
- ""GLUMA"" not common.
- ""KLUMA"" no.

But ""LAURA"" has duplicate A? And L and U: L in 1, A in 2? But then we avoid A in 2 because we are putting it? Actually, we are forced to use A at the end? So we have R and A fixed.

Perhaps ""MURA"" with letters? But 5 letters.

Another: ""BAUKS"" no.

I think ""umbra"" is a practical choice because it tests U in position 1 and introduces M and B.

If ""umbra"" is not the word, we get information about U's position.

Therefore, we choose ""umbra"".

But note: in ""umbra"", position 3 is B and position 2 is M.

And we have U in 1, M in 2, B in 3, R in 4, A in 5.

This assumes that U is in position 1. If U is actually in position 3, then ""umbra"" will show U as not correct? Actually, we get feedback.

So we'll know from the feedback.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
