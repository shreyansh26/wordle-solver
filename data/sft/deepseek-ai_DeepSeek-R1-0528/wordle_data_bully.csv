We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word in Wordle often uses common letters and has a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words include: CRANE, SLATE, AUDIO, STARE, etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word. It has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

We have feedback from the first guess: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)
 This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word at all.

 Since these common letters are not in the word, we need to choose a word that avoids these letters.

 We should pick a word that uses other common letters. Some common letters left: T, L, O, I, S, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, etc.

 Let's aim for a word that has:
 - T, S, L, O, I ... but avoiding C,R,A,N,E.

 Some possibilities: ""TOILS"", ""SLIMY"", ""POINT"", ""BUILD"", etc.

 However, we want to maximize coverage of new common letters.

 Consider ""SPOTLIGHT"" ... but we need 5 letters.

 Let me think of 5-letter words without C,R,A,N,E.

 Good options: 
   ""LOFTS"" -> L, O, F, T, S -> but F is less common? 
   ""MOIST"" -> M, O, I, S, T -> covers several common letters.
   ""PILOT"" -> P, I, L, O, T -> also good.
   ""BUILD"" -> B, U, I, L, D -> covers B, U, I, L, D.

 How about ""MOIST""? It uses M, O, I, S, T. All fairly common.

 Alternatively, ""SYNOD"" avoids C,R,A,N,E? Wait, but ""SYNOD"" has S,Y,N,O,D. We know N is not in the word (from feedback: N(x)), so we cannot use N.

 Important: We must avoid letters that were already excluded: C, R, A, N, E.

 So ""MOIST"" doesn't have any of these: M, O, I, S, T.

 ""MOIST"" seems a good candidate.

 Another option: ""GHOUL"" -> G, H, O, U, L -> but missing more common letters? 

 Alternatively, ""DOUBT"" -> D, O, U, B, T -> also avoids excluded letters.

 Between ""MOIST"" and ""DOUBT"":

 ""MOIST"": letters M, O, I, S, T
 ""DOUBT"": letters D, O, U, B, T

 Both cover 5 new letters. Since we don't have any hits, we want as much coverage as possible.

 But note: We have excluded 5 letters (C,R,A,N,E) so we have 21 left. 

 Another word: ""LUCKY"" -> L, U, C, K, Y -> but C is excluded! So invalid.

 We must avoid excluded letters. So C,R,A,N,E are forbidden.

 Let me choose ""MOIST"" for its common letters.

 After ""CRANE"" being all misses, we have a lot of letters to test. 

 Alternatively, ""SLIMY"": S, L, I, M, Y -> avoids excluded.

 But Y is less common? 

 I think ""MOIST"" is a solid second guess.

 So I'll go with ""moist"".

But note: we have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> 5 new letters.
""FUDGY"": F, U, D, G, Y -> 5 new letters, but F is less common than P? 
""GULPY"": G, U, L, P, Y -> 5 new letters: G, U, L, P, Y.
""BULKY"": B, U, L, K, Y -> 5 new letters: B, U, L, K, Y.
""GLYPH"": G, L, Y, P, H -> 5 new letters: G, L, Y, P, H.

We can also consider ""PUDGY"" and ""BULKY"" and ""GLYPH"".

But note: ""GLYPH"" has two Y's? No, G, L, Y, P, H -> only one Y.

Another candidate: ""WHACK"" -> W, H, A, C, K -> A and C excluded -> invalid.

""QUIPU"" -> Q, U, I, P, U -> I excluded.

""JUDGY"" -> J, U, D, G, Y -> allowed? J, U, D, G, Y: none excluded.

But J is not very common. Similarly, Q and Z are rare.

So let's stick with more common letters: B, D, G, H, K, L, P, U, W, Y.

We can form:
  ""PLUMB"" -> invalid because of M.
  ""BLUSH"" -> B, L, U, S, H -> S excluded.

  ""BULKY"" seems good: B, U, L, K, Y.

  ""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y.

  ""GLYPH"": G, L, Y, P, H.

  ""WACKY"" -> W, A, C, K, Y -> A and C excluded.

  ""DUMPY"" -> D, U, M, P, Y -> M excluded.

  ""HUMAN"" -> H, U, M, A, N -> M, A, N excluded.

  ""LUCID"" -> L, U, C, I, D -> C and I excluded.

  ""PADDY"" -> P, A, D, D, Y -> A excluded.

  ""BUDDY"" -> B, U, D, D, Y -> allowed? B, U, D, D, Y -> but two D's? It's valid, but we don't know if D is in the word.

  ""BUGGY"" -> B, U, G, G, Y -> two G's.

  ""FUGLY"" -> F, U, G, L, Y -> allowed? F, U, G, L, Y: none excluded.

  ""FUDGY"" is also F, U, D, G, Y.

I think ""PUDGY"" and ""BULKY"" are both good. Let's choose one.

Alternatively, ""GLYPH"" is also good because it includes H, which is common.

But note: we are testing 5 new letters. We have 6 tries left? Actually, we are on the third guess (we have 4 more tries after this).

I'll go with ""PUDGY"" because it has D and G, which are common.

But ""BULKY"" has B and K, which are also common.

Another word: ""WIMPY"" -> W, I, M, P, Y -> I and M excluded.

  ""DUVET"" -> excluded letters.

  ""GULCH"" -> G, U, L, C, H -> C excluded.

  ""PULKA"" -> P, U, L, K, A -> A excluded.

  ""YUKKY"" -> Y, U, K, K, Y -> two K's and two Y's? And K is allowed.

But ""YUKKY"" might not be a common word. We need a valid English word.

""PUDGY"" is a valid word (meaning chubby).

""BULKY"" is also valid.

""GLYPH"" is valid (a symbol).

""FUDGY"" is valid (resembling fudge).

I think ""PUDGY"" is a good choice.

But let's see the frequency: 
  U is a vowel, and we haven't tested any vowel except A,E,I,O (which are excluded). So U is the only vowel left? And sometimes Y.

The secret word must have vowels. The only vowels left are U and Y (as a vowel).

So we need to test U and Y.

""PUDGY"" has U and Y? No, it has U and Y (but Y is at the end, which can be a vowel). Actually, ""PUDGY"" has U as the vowel and Y as a consonant? But in any case, it tests both.

Similarly, ""BULKY"" has U and Y.

""GLYPH"" has Y as a vowel? And no U.

So ""PUDGY"" and ""BULKY"" test U and Y.

I'll go with ""pudgy"".

<guess>pudgy</guess>
</think>
After two guesses with all letters excluded (C, R, A, N, E from ""crane"" and M, O, I, S, T from ""moist""), the secret word must consist of letters from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. 

For the third guess, I prioritized:
- Avoiding all 10 excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T).
- Testing new high-frequency consonants (e.g., P, D, G) and the only remaining common vowel (U), along with Y (which can act as a vowel).
- Maximizing coverage of untested letters to gather more information.

The word ""pudgy"" was chosen because:
- It uses 5 new letters: P, U, D, G, Y.
- It is a valid English word (meaning slightly fat).
- It tests U (a critical vowel candidate) and Y (a versatile letter).
- It avoids rare letters (e.g., Q, Z, J) to increase the chance of hits.

If this guess also returns all misses, it will further narrow down the possibilities by excluding P, U, D, G, and Y.

<guess>pudgy</guess>",pudgy,"We have two guesses with all misses:
  Guess 1: crane -> C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
  Guess 2: moist -> M, O, I, S, T are not in the word.

So the secret word does not contain any of these 10 letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T.

We need to choose a word that avoids these 10 letters and uses other common letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible from the remaining set.

Common letters in English (from the remaining): L, U, D, P, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, etc.

We can form words like:
  ""PLUMB"" -> P, L, U, M, B -> but M is excluded (from moist feedback: M(x)), so invalid.
  ""GULPY"" -> G, U, L, P, Y -> all allowed? Let's check: G, U, L, P, Y. None in the excluded list? 
      Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T. So G, U, L, P, Y are all allowed.

  ""BUGLE"" -> B, U, G, L, E -> but E is excluded (from crane: E(x)), so invalid.

  ""LUCKY"" -> L, U, C, K, Y -> C is excluded.

  ""PUDGY"" -> P, U, D, G, Y -> allowed? P, U, D, G, Y: none excluded.

  ""FUDGY"" -> F, U, D, G, Y -> also allowed.

  ""BLIMP"" -> B, L, I, M, P -> I and M are excluded.

  ""JUMPY"" -> J, U, M, P, Y -> M is excluded.

  ""QUACK"" -> Q, U, A, C, K -> A and C are excluded.

  ""QUICK"" -> Q, U, I, C, K -> I and C excluded.

  ""GLYPH"" -> G, L, Y, P, H -> allowed? G, L, Y, P, H: none excluded.

  ""NYMPH"" -> N, Y, M, P, H -> N and M excluded.

  ""PUDGY"" and ""FUDGY"" and ""GULPY"" and ""BULKY"" and ""GLYPH"" are candidates.

But note: we have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> 5 new letters.

""JUDGY"" -> J, U, D, G, Y -> allowed? J, U, D, G, Y: none excluded.

But J is not very common. Similarly, Q and Z are rare.

So let's stick with more common letters: B, D, G, H, K, L, P, U, W, Y.

  ""BUGGY"" -> B, U, G, G, Y -> two G's.

  ""FUGLY"" -> F, U, G, L, Y -> allowed? F, U, G, L, Y: none excluded.

  ""FUDGY"" is also F, U, D, G, Y.

I think ""PUDGY"" and ""BULKY"" are both good. Let's choose one.

Alternatively, ""GLYPH"" is also good because it includes H, which is common.

But note: we are testing 5 new letters. We have 6 tries left? Actually, we are on the third guess (we have 4 more tries after this).

I'll go with ""PUDGY"" because it has D and G, which are common.

But ""BULKY"" has B and K, which are also common.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,bully,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word in Wordle often uses common letters and has a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words include: CRANE, SLATE, AUDIO, STARE, etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word. It has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)
 This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word at all.

 Since these common letters are not in the word, we need to choose a word that avoids these letters.

 We should pick a word that uses other common letters. Some common letters left: T, L, O, I, S, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, etc.

 Let's aim for a word that has:
 - T, S, L, O, I ... but avoiding C,R,A,N,E.

 Some possibilities: ""TOILS"", ""SLIMY"", ""POINT"", ""BUILD"", etc.

 However, we want to maximize coverage of new common letters.

 Consider ""SPOTLIGHT"" ... but we need 5 letters.

 Let me think of 5-letter words without C,R,A,N,E.

 Good options: 
   ""LOFTS"" -> L, O, F, T, S -> but F is less common? 
   ""MOIST"" -> M, O, I, S, T -> covers several common letters.
   ""PILOT"" -> P, I, L, O, T -> also good.
   ""BUILD"" -> B, U, I, L, D -> covers B, U, I, L, D.

 How about ""MOIST""? It uses M, O, I, S, T. All fairly common.

 Alternatively, ""SYNOD"" avoids C,R,A,N,E? Wait, but ""SYNOD"" has S,Y,N,O,D. We know N is not in the word (from feedback: N(x)), so we cannot use N.

 Important: We must avoid letters that were already excluded: C, R, A, N, E.

 So ""MOIST"" doesn't have any of these: M, O, I, S, T.

 ""MOIST"" seems a good candidate.

 Another option: ""GHOUL"" -> G, H, O, U, L -> but missing more common letters? 

 Alternatively, ""DOUBT"" -> D, O, U, B, T -> also avoids excluded letters.

 Between ""MOIST"" and ""DOUBT"":

 ""MOIST"": letters M, O, I, S, T
 ""DOUBT"": letters D, O, U, B, T

 Both cover 5 new letters. Since we don't have any hits, we want as much coverage as possible.

 But note: We have excluded 5 letters (C,R,A,N,E) so we have 21 left. 

 Another word: ""LUCKY"" -> L, U, C, K, Y -> but C is excluded! So invalid.

 We must avoid excluded letters. So C,R,A,N,E are forbidden.

 Let me choose ""MOIST"" for its common letters.

 After ""CRANE"" being all misses, we have a lot of letters to test. 

 Alternatively, ""SLIMY"": S, L, I, M, Y -> avoids excluded.

 But Y is less common? 

 I think ""MOIST"" is a solid second guess.

 So I'll go with ""moist"".

<guess>moist</guess><thought>
The feedback from the first guess ""crane"" showed that **none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E** are in the secret word. Therefore, the secret word contains only letters outside of these five. For the next guess, I need a word that:
- Uses completely new letters (avoiding C, R, A, N, E).
- Prioritizes common English letters to maximize information gain.
Possible candidates include words like ""moist"" (which uses M, O, I, S, T) or ""doubt"" (D, O, U, B, T). ""Moist"" covers five high-frequency consonants and vowels (M, O, I, S, T), making it a strong choice to test new letters efficiently.

<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses with all misses:

We need to choose a word that avoids these 10 letters and uses other common letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible from the remaining set.

  ""NYMPH"" -> N, Y, M, P, H -> N and M excluded.

  ""PUDGY"" and ""FUDGY"" and ""GULPY"" and ""BULKY"" and ""GLYPH"" are candidates.

But note: we have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> 5 new letters.
""FUDGY"": F, U, D, G, Y -> 5 new letters, but F is less common than P? 
""GULPY"": G, U, L, P, Y -> 5 new letters: G, U, L, P, Y.
""BULKY"": B, U, L, K, Y -> 5 new letters: B, U, L, K, Y.
""GLYPH"": G, L, Y, P, H -> 5 new letters: G, L, Y, P, H.

We can also consider ""PUDGY"" and ""BULKY"" and ""GLYPH"".

But note: ""GLYPH"" has two Y's? No, G, L, Y, P, H -> only one Y.

Another candidate: ""WHACK"" -> W, H, A, C, K -> A and C excluded -> invalid.

""QUIPU"" -> Q, U, I, P, U -> I excluded.

""JUDGY"" -> J, U, D, G, Y -> allowed? J, U, D, G, Y: none excluded.

But J is not very common. Similarly, Q and Z are rare.

So let's stick with more common letters: B, D, G, H, K, L, P, U, W, Y.

We can form:
  ""PLUMB"" -> invalid because of M.
  ""BLUSH"" -> B, L, U, S, H -> S excluded.

  ""BULKY"" seems good: B, U, L, K, Y.

  ""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y.

  ""FUGLY"" -> F, U, G, L, Y -> allowed? F, U, G, L, Y: none excluded.

  ""FUDGY"" is also F, U, D, G, Y.

I think ""PUDGY"" and ""BULKY"" are both good. Let's choose one.

But note: we are testing 5 new letters. We have 6 tries left? Actually, we are on the third guess (we have 4 more tries after this).

I'll go with ""PUDGY"" because it has D and G, which are common.

But ""BULKY"" has B and K, which are also common.

  ""DUVET"" -> excluded letters.

  ""GULCH"" -> G, U, L, C, H -> C excluded.

  ""PULKA"" -> P, U, L, K, A -> A excluded.

  ""YUKKY"" -> Y, U, K, K, Y -> two K's and two Y's? And K is allowed.

But ""YUKKY"" might not be a common word. We need a valid English word.

""PUDGY"" is a valid word (meaning chubby).

""BULKY"" is also valid.

""GLYPH"" is valid (a symbol).

""FUDGY"" is valid (resembling fudge).

I think ""PUDGY"" is a good choice.

But let's see the frequency: 
  U is a vowel, and we haven't tested any vowel except A,E,I,O (which are excluded). So U is the only vowel left? And sometimes Y.

The secret word must have vowels. The only vowels left are U and Y (as a vowel).

So we need to test U and Y.

""PUDGY"" has U and Y? No, it has U and Y (but Y is at the end, which can be a vowel). Actually, ""PUDGY"" has U as the vowel and Y as a consonant? But in any case, it tests both.

Similarly, ""BULKY"" has U and Y.

""GLYPH"" has Y as a vowel? And no U.

So ""PUDGY"" and ""BULKY"" test U and Y.

I'll go with ""pudgy"".

<guess>pudgy</guess>After two guesses with all letters excluded (C, R, A, N, E from ""crane"" and M, O, I, S, T from ""moist""), the secret word must consist of letters from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. 

For the third guess, I prioritized:
- Avoiding all 10 excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T).
- Testing new high-frequency consonants (e.g., P, D, G) and the only remaining common vowel (U), along with Y (which can act as a vowel).
- Maximizing coverage of untested letters to gather more information.

The word ""pudgy"" was chosen because:
- It uses 5 new letters: P, U, D, G, Y.
- It is a valid English word (meaning slightly fat).
- It tests U (a critical vowel candidate) and Y (a versatile letter).
- It avoids rare letters (e.g., Q, Z, J) to increase the chance of hits.

If this guess also returns all misses, it will further narrow down the possibilities by excluding P, U, D, G, and Y.

So U is the only vowel left? And sometimes Y.\n\nThe secret word must have vowels. The only vowels left are U and Y (as a vowel).\n\nSo we need to test U and Y.\n\n""PUDGY"" has U and Y? No, it has U and Y (but Y is at the end, which can be a vowel). Actually, ""PUDGY"" has U as the vowel and Y as a consonant? But in any case, it tests both.\n\nSimilarly, ""BULKY"" has U and Y.\n\n""GLYPH"" has Y as a vowel? And no U.\n\nSo ""PUDGY"" and ""BULKY"" test U and Y.\n\nI\'ll go with ""pudgy"".\n\n<guess>pudgy</guess>After two guesses with all letters excluded (C, R, A, N, E from ""crane"" and M, O, I, S, T from ""moist""), the secret word must consist of letters from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. \n\nFor the third guess, I prioritized:\n- Avoiding all 10 excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T).\n- Testing new high-frequency consonants (e.g., P, D, G) and the only remaining common vowel (U), along with Y (which can act as a vowel).\n- Maximizing coverage of untested letters to gather more information.\n\nThe word ""pudgy"" was chosen because:\n- It uses 5 new letters: P, U, D, G, Y.\n- It is a valid English word (meaning slightly fat).\n- It tests U (a critical vowel candidate) and Y (a versatile letter).\n- It avoids rare letters (e.g., Q, Z, J) to increase the chance of hits.\n\nIf this guess also returns all misses, it will further narrow down the possibilities by excluding P, U, D, G, and Y.\n\n<guess>pudgy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: pudgy -> FEEDBACK: P(x) U(✓) D(x) G(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from the third guess ""pudgy"":
  P(x) -> P is not in the word.
  U(✓) -> U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
  D(x) -> D is not in the word.
  G(x) -> G is not in the word.
  Y(✓) -> Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So, we know:
- The word has U in the second position and Y in the fifth position.
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T, P, D, G (from previous feedback).

Also, from the current feedback, P, D, G are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ U _ _ Y

And the remaining letters that are possible: from the alphabet, excluding the known absent letters.

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T, P, D, G.

So allowed letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: U and Y are already in the word, so they might appear again? However, we don't have any indication of duplicates yet. Since we have U and Y placed, and they are correct, we can assume they are single for now, but we should be cautious.

The word has at least U and Y, and we know their positions.

We need to fill the first, third, and fourth positions.

The word: [letter1] U [letter3] [letter4] Y

We must choose letter1, letter3, letter4 from the allowed set: B, F, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z (note: U and Y are already used, but we can use them again? The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates, so we cannot rule out duplicates. However, since we have U and Y already placed and correct, if there were duplicates, we might have gotten feedback for them. But in ""pudgy"", we only had U and Y correct, and the others wrong. So it's possible that the word has only one U and one Y, but we don't know for sure.

Given the constraints, we should avoid using U and Y again in other positions unless necessary, because we already know about them. We want to test new letters.

So for the next guess, we should try to use new letters from the allowed set to get more information.

Allowed letters for new positions: B, F, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need to form a word that fits the pattern: _ U _ _ Y

And uses only letters from the allowed set (and we can use U and Y only if necessary, but we already have them in the correct positions, so we can use other letters to test).

But note: the word must be a valid English word.

Let's think of words that end with Y and have U as the second letter.

Pattern: ?U??Y

We can try:

- BUY? But that's 3 letters. We need 5 letters.

5-letter words: 

- BULKY? But we know B is allowed, U is fixed, L is allowed, K is allowed, Y is fixed. But ""BULKY"" has 5 letters: B-U-L-K-Y. However, we have feedback that L and K are not excluded? We haven't tested L and K yet. But in ""pudgy"", we didn't test L and K. So ""BULKY"" is a candidate? But wait, we have to check if it uses any excluded letters.

""BULKY"": B, U, L, K, Y. 
- B: allowed (not excluded)
- U: in word, correct position
- L: allowed (not excluded)
- K: allowed (not excluded)
- Y: in word, correct position

But we are not sure if L and K are in the word. We are guessing to test.

However, we are on the fourth guess, and we have two correct letters. We can try to guess the word if we have a good candidate.

But let's see other possibilities.

Other words: 
- FUNKY: F, U, N, K, Y -> but N is excluded (from ""crane"": N(x)), so invalid.
- JUMBO: J, U, M, B, O -> M and O excluded.
- JUMPY: J, U, M, P, Y -> M and P excluded.
- LUCKY: L, U, C, K, Y -> C excluded.
- PUSHY: P, U, S, H, Y -> P and S excluded.
- BUSHY: B, U, S, H, Y -> S excluded.
- FUSSY: F, U, S, S, Y -> S excluded.
- GULPY: G, U, L, P, Y -> G and P excluded.
- HUSKY: H, U, S, K, Y -> S excluded.
- MUSKY: M, U, S, K, Y -> M and S excluded.
- PULPY: P, U, L, P, Y -> P excluded.
- WUSSY: W, U, S, S, Y -> S excluded.

Now, with the allowed letters, what can we have?

We need words with second letter U and last letter Y, and the other letters from {B, F, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z}.

Let me list possible words:

- BULKY: B, U, L, K, Y -> all allowed? B, L, K are not excluded. So yes.
- FUNKY: but N excluded.
- JUNKY: J, U, N, K, Y -> N excluded.
- KUDZU: K, U, D, Z, U -> D excluded, and also two U's? But D is excluded. Invalid.
- LUMMY: not a word? and M excluded.
- PUPPY: P excluded.
- QUAKY: Q, U, A, K, Y -> A excluded.
- QUICK: I and C excluded.
- QUIRK: Q, U, I, R, K -> I and R excluded.
- QUIPY: not a word? and P excluded if we consider, but also I excluded.
- VUGHY: not a word.
- WURST: W, U, R, S, T -> R, S, T excluded.
- ZAPPY: Z, A, P, P, Y -> A and P excluded.

Another word: ""BUHLY""? Not common.

""BURLY"": B, U, R, L, Y -> but R is excluded (from ""crane"": R(x)).

""FULLY"": F, U, L, L, Y -> but L is allowed? F, U, L, L, Y. But we have two L's. And F is allowed. However, we don't know if L is in the word. But ""FULLY"" is a word.

But note: the pattern is _ U _ _ Y. So positions: 1: F, 2: U (fixed), 3: L, 4: L, 5: Y (fixed). But we have two L's. Is that allowed? Yes, but we don't know if the word has L.

Similarly, ""BULLY"": B, U, L, L, Y -> same as above.

But we have to check if L is excluded? No, L has not been tested yet.

Similarly, ""FURRY"": F, U, R, R, Y -> R excluded.

""HUFFY"": H, U, F, F, Y -> allowed? H, U, F, F, Y. F is allowed? Yes, F is not excluded. And H is allowed.

""HUFFY"" is a word (meaning easily offended).

Similarly, ""JUFFY""? Not a word.

""KUFFY""? Not a word.

""LUFFY"": L, U, F, F, Y -> allowed? L, U, F, F, Y. L and F allowed.

""LUFFY"" might be a word? In sailing, but not common. Prefer common words.

""PUFFY"": P excluded.

""WUFFY""? Not a word.

""BUFFY"": B, U, F, F, Y -> allowed? B, U, F, F, Y. B and F allowed.

""BUFFY"" is a word (a name or meaning covered with buff).

But we have two F's.

Another word: ""JUMBY""? J, U, M, B, Y -> M excluded.

""KUDOS"": K, U, D, O, S -> D, O, S excluded.

""QUADS"": Q, U, A, D, S -> A, D, S excluded.

""QUAFF"": Q, U, A, F, F -> A excluded.

""QUAKE"": Q, U, A, K, E -> A and E excluded.

""QUALM"": Q, U, A, L, M -> A and M excluded.

""QUARK"": Q, U, A, R, K -> A and R excluded.

""QUART"": Q, U, A, R, T -> A, R, T excluded.

""QUASH"": Q, U, A, S, H -> A and S excluded.

""QUASI"": Q, U, A, S, I -> A, S, I excluded.

""QUAYS"": Q, U, A, Y, S -> A and S excluded, and Y is already in position 5, but here it's in position 4? Not the same.

We need Y at the end.

""QUEUE"": Q, U, E, U, E -> E excluded.

""QUICK"": I and C excluded.

""QUIET"": Q, U, I, E, T -> I, E, T excluded.

""QUILL"": Q, U, I, L, L -> I excluded.

""QUINT"": Q, U, I, N, T -> I, N, T excluded.

""QUIRK"": Q, U, I, R, K -> I and R excluded.

""QUITE"": Q, U, I, T, E -> I, T, E excluded.

""QUOTA"": Q, U, O, T, A -> O, T, A excluded.

""QUOTH"": Q, U, O, T, H -> O, T excluded.

""VODKA"": V, O, D, K, A -> O, D, A excluded.

""WACKO"": W, A, C, K, O -> A, C, O excluded.

""WALTZ"": W, A, L, T, Z -> A, T excluded.

""WELCH"": W, E, L, C, H -> E, C excluded.

""WENCH"": W, E, N, C, H -> E, N, C excluded.

""WHACK"": W, H, A, C, K -> A, C excluded.

""WHELP"": W, H, E, L, P -> E, P excluded.

""WIMPY"": W, I, M, P, Y -> I, M, P excluded.

""WOMAN"": W, O, M, A, N -> O, M, A, N excluded.

""WORMY"": W, O, R, M, Y -> O, R, M excluded.

""YUCKY"": Y, U, C, K, Y -> C excluded, and Y is at position 1 and 5? But we need U at position 2.

Back to: we have a few candidates:

- BULKY: B, U, L, K, Y
- BULLY: B, U, L, L, Y
- BUFFY: B, U, F, F, Y
- FULLY: F, U, L, L, Y
- HUFFY: H, U, F, F, Y
- LUFFY: L, U, F, F, Y (if accepted)

But note: we have U and Y fixed, so we are only testing the first, third, and fourth letters.

We want to maximize information. If we use a word with repeated letters, we get less information about other letters.

For example, in ""BULLY"", we test B and L, but with two L's, if we get feedback, we might not know if L is in the word or not? Actually, if L is in the word, we might get a hit on one of the positions, but since they are the same, it might be confusing. But the feedback will show for each position.

But it's better to have distinct letters to test more.

So ""BULKY"" tests three distinct letters: B, L, K.

""BUFFY"" tests B and F (with F repeated).

""FULLY"" tests F and L (with L repeated).

So ""BULKY"" is better because it tests three new letters: B, L, K.

Similarly, we can consider ""KULAK"": K, U, L, A, K -> A excluded.

""VUGHY"" not a word.

""WUDUS"" not a word.

""XEROX"" has E and O excluded.

""ZILCH"": Z, I, L, C, H -> I and C excluded.

""ZINCY"": Z, I, N, C, Y -> I, N, C excluded.

""ZIPPY"": Z, I, P, P, Y -> I, P excluded.

""ZLOTY"": Z, L, O, T, Y -> O, T excluded.

""ZONKY"" not a word.

So ""BULKY"" seems a good candidate.

But we have to make sure that B, L, K are not excluded. They are not in the excluded list.

Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T,P,D,G.

So B, L, K are allowed.

Therefore, I will guess ""bulky"".

But note: in ""pudgy"", we had U and Y correct, so in ""bulky"", we have U and Y in the same positions, which is good. And we are testing B, L, K.

If the word is ""bulky"", we get it right. If not, we get feedback on B, L, K.

So let's go with that.

<guess>bulky</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent, so they are excluded.
- **Guess 2 (moist)**: All letters (M, O, I, S, T) are absent, so they are excluded.
- **Guess 3 (pudgy)**:
  - P and D are absent (excluded).
  - U is correct and in position 2.
  - Y is correct and in position 5.
  - G is absent (excluded).

**Key insights**:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ U _ _ Y` (U in position 2, Y in position 5).
- Excluded letters (cannot be in the word): C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T, P, D, G.
- Remaining possible letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z.
- Since U and Y are already confirmed, the next guess should prioritize testing new letters from the remaining set to gather information about positions 1, 3, and 4.

**Strategy for the next guess**:
- Focus on words matching `_ U _ _ Y` using untested letters (B, F, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z).
- Avoid repeating U and Y in other positions to maximize new information.
- Prefer words with distinct letters to test more possibilities at once.
- ""BULKY"" (B, U, L, K, Y) fits perfectly:
  - Tests three new letters: B (position 1), L (position 3), K (position 4).
  - All letters are from the allowed set and not excluded.
  - It is a valid English word (meaning taking up much space).

If ""BULKY"" is incorrect, the feedback on B, L, and K will significantly narrow down possibilities for the remaining guesses.

<guess>bulky</guess>",bulky,"We have feedback from the third guess ""pudgy"":
  P(x) -> P is not in the word.
  U(✓) -> U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
  D(x) -> D is not in the word.
  G(x) -> G is not in the word.
  Y(✓) -> Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So, we know:
- The word has U in the second position and Y in the fifth position.
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T, P, D, G (from previous feedback).

Also, from the current feedback, P, D, G are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ U _ _ Y

And the remaining letters that are possible: from the alphabet, excluding the known absent letters.

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T, P, D, G.

So allowed letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: U and Y are already in the word, so they might appear again? However, we don't have any indication of duplicates yet. Since we have U and Y placed, and they are correct, we can assume they are single for now, but we should be cautious.

The word has at least U and Y, and we know their positions.

We need to fill the first, third, and fourth positions.

The word: [letter1] U [letter3] [letter4] Y

We must choose letter1, letter3, letter4 from the allowed set: B, F, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z (note: U and Y are already used, but we can use them again? The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates, so we cannot rule out duplicates. However, since we have U and Y already placed and correct, if there were duplicates, we might have gotten feedback for them. But in ""pudgy"", we only had U and Y correct, and the others wrong. So it's possible that the word has only one U and one Y, but we don't know for sure.

Given the constraints, we should avoid using U and Y again in other positions unless necessary, because we already know about them. We want to test new letters.

So for the next guess, we should try to use new letters from the allowed set to get more information.

Allowed letters for new positions: B, F, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need to form a word that fits the pattern: _ U _ _ Y

And uses only letters from the allowed set (and we can use U and Y only if necessary, but we already have them in the correct positions, so we can use other letters to test).

But note: the word must be a valid English word.

Let's think of words that end with Y and have U as the second letter.

Pattern: ?U??Y

We can try:

- BUY? But that's 3 letters. We need 5 letters.

5-letter words: 

- BULKY? But we know B is allowed, U is fixed, L is allowed, K is allowed, Y is fixed. But ""BULKY"" has 5 letters: B-U-L-K-Y. However, we have feedback that L and K are not excluded? We haven't tested L and K yet. But in ""pudgy"", we didn't test L and K. So ""BULKY"" is a candidate? But wait, we have to check if it uses any excluded letters.

""BULKY"": B, U, L, K, Y. 
- B: allowed (not excluded)
- U: in word, correct position
- L: allowed (not excluded)
- K: allowed (not excluded)
- Y: in word, correct position

But we are not sure if L and K are in the word. We are guessing to test.

However, we are on the fourth guess, and we have two correct letters. We can try to guess the word if we have a good candidate.

But let's see other possibilities.

Other words: 
- FUNKY: F, U, N, K, Y -> but N is excluded (from ""crane"": N(x)), so invalid.
- JUMBO: J, U, M, B, O -> M and O excluded.
- JUMPY: J, U, M, P, Y -> M and P excluded.
- LUCKY: L, U, C, K, Y -> C excluded.
- PUSHY: P, U, S, H, Y -> P and S excluded.
- BUSHY: B, U, S, H, Y -> S excluded.
- FUSSY: F, U, S, S, Y -> S excluded.
- GULPY: G, U, L, P, Y -> G and P excluded.
- HUSKY: H, U, S, K, Y -> S excluded.
- MUSKY: M, U, S, K, Y -> M and S excluded.
- PULPY: P, U, L, P, Y -> P excluded.
- WUSSY: W, U, S, S, Y -> S excluded.

Now, with the allowed letters, what can we have?

We need words with second letter U and last letter Y, and the other letters from {B, F, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z}.

Let me list possible words:

- BULKY: B, U, L, K, Y -> all allowed? B, L, K are not excluded. So yes.
- FUNKY: but N excluded.
- JUNKY: J, U, N, K, Y -> N excluded.
- KUDZU: K, U, D, Z, U -> D excluded, and also two U's? But D is excluded. Invalid.
- LUMMY: not a word? and M excluded.
- PUPPY: P excluded.
- QUAKY: Q, U, A, K, Y -> A excluded.
- QUICK: I and C excluded.
- QUIRK: Q, U, I, R, K -> I and R excluded.
- QUIPY: not a word? and P excluded if we consider, but also I excluded.
- VUGHY: not a word.
- WURST: W, U, R, S, T -> R, S, T excluded.
- ZAPPY: Z, A, P, P, Y -> A and P excluded.

Another word: ""BUHLY""? Not common.

""BURLY"": B, U, R, L, Y -> but R is excluded (from ""crane"": R(x)).

""FULLY"": F, U, L, L, Y -> but L is allowed? F, U, L, L, Y. But we have two L's. And F is allowed. However, we don't know if L is in the word. But ""FULLY"" is a word.

But note: the pattern is _ U _ _ Y. So positions: 1: F, 2: U (fixed), 3: L, 4: L, 5: Y (fixed). But we have two L's. Is that allowed? Yes, but we don't know if the word has L.

Similarly, ""BULLY"": B, U, L, L, Y -> same as above.

But we have to check if L is excluded? No, L has not been tested yet.

Similarly, ""FURRY"": F, U, R, R, Y -> R excluded.

""HUFFY"": H, U, F, F, Y -> allowed? H, U, F, F, Y. F is allowed? Yes, F is not excluded. And H is allowed.

""HUFFY"" is a word (meaning easily offended).

Similarly, ""JUFFY""? Not a word.

""KUFFY""? Not a word.

""LUFFY"": L, U, F, F, Y -> allowed? L, U, F, F, Y. L and F allowed.

""LUFFY"" might be a word? In sailing, but not common. Prefer common words.

""PUFFY"": P excluded.

""WUFFY""? Not a word.

""BUFFY"": B, U, F, F, Y -> allowed? B, U, F, F, Y. B and F allowed.

""BUFFY"" is a word (a name or meaning covered with buff).

But we have two F's.

Another word: ""JUMBY""? J, U, M, B, Y -> M excluded.

""KUDOS"": K, U, D, O, S -> D, O, S excluded.

""QUADS"": Q, U, A, D, S -> A, D, S excluded.

""QUAFF"": Q, U, A, F, F -> A excluded.

""QUAKE"": Q, U, A, K, E -> A and E excluded.

""QUALM"": Q, U, A, L, M -> A and M excluded.

""QUARK"": Q, U, A, R, K -> A and R excluded.

""QUART"": Q, U, A, R, T -> A, R, T excluded.

""QUASH"": Q, U, A, S, H -> A and S excluded.

""QUASI"": Q, U, A, S, I -> A, S, I excluded.

""QUAYS"": Q, U, A, Y, S -> A and S excluded, and Y is already in position 5, but here it's in position 4? Not the same.

We need Y at the end.

""QUEUE"": Q, U, E, U, E -> E excluded.

""QUICK"": I and C excluded.

""QUIET"": Q, U, I, E, T -> I, E, T excluded.

""QUILL"": Q, U, I, L, L -> I excluded.

""QUINT"": Q, U, I, N, T -> I, N, T excluded.

""QUIRK"": Q, U, I, R, K -> I and R excluded.

""QUITE"": Q, U, I, T, E -> I, T, E excluded.

""QUOTA"": Q, U, O, T, A -> O, T, A excluded.

""QUOTH"": Q, U, O, T, H -> O, T excluded.

""VODKA"": V, O, D, K, A -> O, D, A excluded.

""WACKO"": W, A, C, K, O -> A, C, O excluded.

""WALTZ"": W, A, L, T, Z -> A, T excluded.

""WELCH"": W, E, L, C, H -> E, C excluded.

""WENCH"": W, E, N, C, H -> E, N, C excluded.

""WHACK"": W, H, A, C, K -> A, C excluded.

""WHELP"": W, H, E, L, P -> E, P excluded.

""WIMPY"": W, I, M, P, Y -> I, M, P excluded.

""WOMAN"": W, O, M, A, N -> O, M, A, N excluded.

""WORMY"": W, O, R, M, Y -> O, R, M excluded.

""YUCKY"": Y, U, C, K, Y -> C excluded, and Y is at position 1 and 5? But we need U at position 2.

Back to: we have a few candidates:

- BULKY: B, U, L, K, Y
- BULLY: B, U, L, L, Y
- BUFFY: B, U, F, F, Y
- FULLY: F, U, L, L, Y
- HUFFY: H, U, F, F, Y
- LUFFY: L, U, F, F, Y (if accepted)

But note: we have U and Y fixed, so we are only testing the first, third, and fourth letters.

We want to maximize information. If we use a word with repeated letters, we get less information about other letters.

For example, in ""BULLY"", we test B and L, but with two L's, if we get feedback, we might not know if L is in the word or not? Actually, if L is in the word, we might get a hit on one of the positions, but since they are the same, it might be confusing. But the feedback will show for each position.

But it's better to have distinct letters to test more.

So ""BULKY"" tests three distinct letters: B, L, K.

""BUFFY"" tests B and F (with F repeated).

""FULLY"" tests F and L (with L repeated).

So ""BULKY"" is better because it tests three new letters: B, L, K.

Similarly, we can consider ""KULAK"": K, U, L, A, K -> A excluded.

""VUGHY"" not a word.

""WUDUS"" not a word.

""XEROX"" has E and O excluded.

""ZILCH"": Z, I, L, C, H -> I and C excluded.

""ZINCY"": Z, I, N, C, Y -> I, N, C excluded.

""ZIPPY"": Z, I, P, P, Y -> I, P excluded.

""ZLOTY"": Z, L, O, T, Y -> O, T excluded.

""ZONKY"" not a word.

So ""BULKY"" seems a good candidate.

But we have to make sure that B, L, K are not excluded. They are not in the excluded list.

Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T,P,D,G.

So B, L, K are allowed.

Therefore, I will guess ""bulky"".

But note: in ""pudgy"", we had U and Y correct, so in ""bulky"", we have U and Y in the same positions, which is good. And we are testing B, L, K.

If the word is ""bulky"", we get it right. If not, we get feedback on B, L, K.

So let's go with that.

<guess>bulky</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent, so they are excluded.
- **Guess 2 (moist)**: All letters (M, O, I, S, T) are absent, so they are excluded.
- **Guess 3 (pudgy)**:
  - P and D are absent (excluded).
  - U is correct and in position 2.
  - Y is correct and in position 5.
  - G is absent (excluded).

**Key insights**:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ U _ _ Y` (U in position 2, Y in position 5).
- Excluded letters (cannot be in the word): C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T, P, D, G.
- Remaining possible letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z.
- Since U and Y are already confirmed, the next guess should prioritize testing new letters from the remaining set to gather information about positions 1, 3, and 4.

**Strategy for the next guess**:
- Focus on words matching `_ U _ _ Y` using untested letters (B, F, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z).
- Avoid repeating U and Y in other positions to maximize new information.
- Prefer words with distinct letters to test more possibilities at once.

  - Tests three new letters: B (position 1), L (position 3), K (position 4).
  - All letters are from the allowed set and not excluded.
  - It is a valid English word (meaning taking up much space).

If ""BULKY"" is incorrect, the feedback on B, L, and K will significantly narrow down possibilities for the remaining guesses.",Guess 4: bulky -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) U(✓) L(✓) K(x) Y(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,bully,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word in Wordle often uses common letters and has a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words include: CRANE, SLATE, AUDIO, STARE, etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word. It has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)
 This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word at all.

 Since these common letters are not in the word, we need to choose a word that avoids these letters.

 We should pick a word that uses other common letters. Some common letters left: T, L, O, I, S, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, etc.

 Let's aim for a word that has:
 - T, S, L, O, I ... but avoiding C,R,A,N,E.

 Some possibilities: ""TOILS"", ""SLIMY"", ""POINT"", ""BUILD"", etc.

 However, we want to maximize coverage of new common letters.

 Consider ""SPOTLIGHT"" ... but we need 5 letters.

 Let me think of 5-letter words without C,R,A,N,E.

 Good options: 
   ""LOFTS"" -> L, O, F, T, S -> but F is less common? 
   ""MOIST"" -> M, O, I, S, T -> covers several common letters.
   ""PILOT"" -> P, I, L, O, T -> also good.
   ""BUILD"" -> B, U, I, L, D -> covers B, U, I, L, D.

 How about ""MOIST""? It uses M, O, I, S, T. All fairly common.

 Alternatively, ""SYNOD"" avoids C,R,A,N,E? Wait, but ""SYNOD"" has S,Y,N,O,D. We know N is not in the word (from feedback: N(x)), so we cannot use N.

 Important: We must avoid letters that were already excluded: C, R, A, N, E.

 So ""MOIST"" doesn't have any of these: M, O, I, S, T.

 ""MOIST"" seems a good candidate.

 Another option: ""GHOUL"" -> G, H, O, U, L -> but missing more common letters? 

 Alternatively, ""DOUBT"" -> D, O, U, B, T -> also avoids excluded letters.

 Between ""MOIST"" and ""DOUBT"":

 ""MOIST"": letters M, O, I, S, T
 ""DOUBT"": letters D, O, U, B, T

 Both cover 5 new letters. Since we don't have any hits, we want as much coverage as possible.

 But note: We have excluded 5 letters (C,R,A,N,E) so we have 21 left. 

 Another word: ""LUCKY"" -> L, U, C, K, Y -> but C is excluded! So invalid.

 We must avoid excluded letters. So C,R,A,N,E are forbidden.

 Let me choose ""MOIST"" for its common letters.

 After ""CRANE"" being all misses, we have a lot of letters to test. 

 Alternatively, ""SLIMY"": S, L, I, M, Y -> avoids excluded.

 But Y is less common? 

 I think ""MOIST"" is a solid second guess.

 So I'll go with ""moist"".

<guess>moist</guess><thought>
The feedback from the first guess ""crane"" showed that **none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E** are in the secret word. Therefore, the secret word contains only letters outside of these five. For the next guess, I need a word that:
- Uses completely new letters (avoiding C, R, A, N, E).
- Prioritizes common English letters to maximize information gain.
Possible candidates include words like ""moist"" (which uses M, O, I, S, T) or ""doubt"" (D, O, U, B, T). ""Moist"" covers five high-frequency consonants and vowels (M, O, I, S, T), making it a strong choice to test new letters efficiently.
</p>

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses with all misses:
  Guess 1: crane -> C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
  Guess 2: moist -> M, O, I, S, T are not in the word.

So the secret word does not contain any of these 10 letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T.

We need to choose a word that avoids these 10 letters and uses other common letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible from the remaining set.

Common letters in English (from the remaining): L, U, D, P, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, etc.

We can form words like:
  ""PLUMB"" -> P, L, U, M, B -> but M is excluded (from moist feedback: M(x)), so invalid.
  ""GULPY"" -> G, U, L, P, Y -> all allowed? Let's check: G, U, L, P, Y. None in the excluded list? 
      Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T. So G, U, L, P, Y are all allowed.

  ""BUGLE"" -> B, U, G, L, E -> but E is excluded (from crane: E(x)), so invalid.

  ""LUCKY"" -> L, U, C, K, Y -> C is excluded.

  ""PUDGY"" -> P, U, D, G, Y -> allowed? P, U, D, G, Y: none excluded.

  ""FUDGY"" -> F, U, D, G, Y -> also allowed.

  ""BLIMP"" -> B, L, I, M, P -> I and M are excluded.

  ""JUMPY"" -> J, U, M, P, Y -> M is excluded.

  ""QUACK"" -> Q, U, A, C, K -> A and C are excluded.

  ""QUICK"" -> Q, U, I, C, K -> I and C excluded.

  ""WALTZ"" -> W, A, L, T, Z -> A and T excluded.

  ""LYMPH"" -> L, Y, M, P, H -> M excluded.

  ""GYPSY"" -> G, Y, P, S, Y -> S excluded.

  ""PYGMY"" -> P, Y, G, M, Y -> M excluded.

  ""BULKY"" -> B, U, L, K, Y -> allowed? B, U, L, K, Y: none excluded.

  ""PULPY"" -> P, U, L, P, Y -> but has two P's? And we don't know if P is in the word. But it's allowed.

  ""DUVET"" -> D, U, V, E, T -> E and T excluded.

  ""GIVEN"" -> G, I, V, E, N -> I, E, N excluded.

  ""HAPPY"" -> H, A, P, P, Y -> A excluded.

  ""DUCHY"" -> D, U, C, H, Y -> C excluded.

  ""FJORD"" -> F, J, O, R, D -> O and R excluded.

  ""WHELP"" -> W, H, E, L, P -> E excluded.

  ""KINKY"" -> K, I, N, K, Y -> I and N excluded.

  ""VIVID"" -> V, I, V, I, D -> I excluded.

  ""ZEBRA"" -> Z, E, B, R, A -> E, R, A excluded.

  ""BOXED"" -> B, O, X, E, D -> O and E excluded.

  ""JUMPS"" -> J, U, M, P, S -> M and S excluded.

  ""QUOTH"" -> Q, U, O, T, H -> O and T excluded.

  ""GLYPH"" -> G, L, Y, P, H -> allowed? G, L, Y, P, H: none excluded.

  ""NYMPH"" -> N, Y, M, P, H -> N and M excluded.

  ""PUDGY"" and ""FUDGY"" and ""GULPY"" and ""BULKY"" and ""GLYPH"" are candidates.

But note: we have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> 5 new letters.
""FUDGY"": F, U, D, G, Y -> 5 new letters, but F is less common than P? 
""GULPY"": G, U, L, P, Y -> 5 new letters: G, U, L, P, Y.
""BULKY"": B, U, L, K, Y -> 5 new letters: B, U, L, K, Y.
""GLYPH"": G, L, Y, P, H -> 5 new letters: G, L, Y, P, H.

We can also consider ""PUDGY"" and ""BULKY"" and ""GLYPH"".

But note: ""GLYPH"" has two Y's? No, G, L, Y, P, H -> only one Y.

Another candidate: ""WHACK"" -> W, H, A, C, K -> A and C excluded -> invalid.

""QUIPU"" -> Q, U, I, P, U -> I excluded.

""JUDGY"" -> J, U, D, G, Y -> allowed? J, U, D, G, Y: none excluded.

But J is not very common. Similarly, Q and Z are rare.

So let's stick with more common letters: B, D, G, H, K, L, P, U, W, Y.

We can form:
  ""PLUMB"" -> invalid because of M.
  ""BLUSH"" -> B, L, U, S, H -> S excluded.

  ""BULKY"" seems good: B, U, L, K, Y.

  ""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y.

  ""GLYPH"": G, L, Y, P, H.

  ""WACKY"" -> W, A, C, K, Y -> A and C excluded.

  ""DUMPY"" -> D, U, M, P, Y -> M excluded.

  ""HUMAN"" -> H, U, M, A, N -> M, A, N excluded.

  ""LUCID"" -> L, U, C, I, D -> C and I excluded.

  ""PADDY"" -> P, A, D, D, Y -> A excluded.

  ""BUDDY"" -> B, U, D, D, Y -> allowed? B, U, D, D, Y -> but two D's? It's valid, but we don't know if D is in the word.

  ""BUGGY"" -> B, U, G, G, Y -> two G's.

  ""FUGLY"" -> F, U, G, L, Y -> allowed? F, U, G, L, Y: none excluded.

  ""FUDGY"" is also F, U, D, G, Y.

I think ""PUDGY"" and ""BULKY"" are both good. Let's choose one.

Alternatively, ""GLYPH"" is also good because it includes H, which is common.

But note: we are testing 5 new letters. We have 6 tries left? Actually, we are on the third guess (we have 4 more tries after this).

I'll go with ""PUDGY"" because it has D and G, which are common.

But ""BULKY"" has B and K, which are also common.

Another word: ""WIMPY"" -> W, I, M, P, Y -> I and M excluded.

  ""DUVET"" -> excluded letters.

  ""GULCH"" -> G, U, L, C, H -> C excluded.

  ""PULKA"" -> P, U, L, K, A -> A excluded.

  ""YUKKY"" -> Y, U, K, K, Y -> two K's and two Y's? And K is allowed.

But ""YUKKY"" might not be a common word. We need a valid English word.

""PUDGY"" is a valid word (meaning chubby).

""BULKY"" is also valid.

""GLYPH"" is valid (a symbol).

""FUDGY"" is valid (resembling fudge).

I think ""PUDGY"" is a good choice.

But let's see the frequency: 
  U is a vowel, and we haven't tested any vowel except A,E,I,O (which are excluded). So U is the only vowel left? And sometimes Y.

The secret word must have vowels. The only vowels left are U and Y (as a vowel).

So we need to test U and Y.

""PUDGY"" has U and Y? No, it has U and Y (but Y is at the end, which can be a vowel). Actually, ""PUDGY"" has U as the vowel and Y as a consonant? But in any case, it tests both.

Similarly, ""BULKY"" has U and Y.

""GLYPH"" has Y as a vowel? And no U.

So ""PUDGY"" and ""BULKY"" test U and Y.

I'll go with ""pudgy"".

<guess>pudgy</guess>After two guesses with all letters excluded (C, R, A, N, E from ""crane"" and M, O, I, S, T from ""moist""), the secret word must consist of letters from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. 

For the third guess, I prioritized:
- Avoiding all 10 excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T).
- Testing new high-frequency consonants (e.g., P, D, G) and the only remaining common vowel (U), along with Y (which can act as a vowel).
- Maximizing coverage of untested letters to gather more information.

The word ""pudgy"" was chosen because:
- It uses 5 new letters: P, U, D, G, Y.
- It is a valid English word (meaning slightly fat).
- It tests U (a critical vowel candidate) and Y (a versatile letter).
- It avoids rare letters (e.g., Q, Z, J) to increase the chance of hits.

If this guess also returns all misses, it will further narrow down the possibilities by excluding P, U, D, G, and Y.

<guess>pudgy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) T(x)
Guess 3: pudgy -> FEEDBACK: P(x) U(✓) D(x) G(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the third guess ""pudgy"":
  P(x) -> P is not in the word.
  U(✓) -> U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
  D(x) -> D is not in the word.
  G(x) -> G is not in the word.
  Y(✓) -> Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So, we know:
- The word has U in the second position and Y in the fifth position.
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T, P, D, G (from previous feedback).

Also, from the current feedback, P, D, G are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ U _ _ Y

And the remaining letters that are possible: from the alphabet, excluding the known absent letters.

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T, P, D, G.

So allowed letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: U and Y are already in the word, so they might appear again? However, we don't have any indication of duplicates yet. Since we have U and Y placed, and they are correct, we can assume they are single for now, but we should be cautious.

The word has at least U and Y, and we know their positions.

We need to fill the first, third, and fourth positions.

The word: [letter1] U [letter3] [letter4] Y

We must choose letter1, letter3, letter4 from the allowed set: B, F, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z (note: U and Y are already used, but we can use them again? The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates, so we cannot rule out duplicates. However, since we have U and Y already placed and correct, if there were duplicates, we might have gotten feedback for them. But in ""pudgy"", we only had U and Y correct, and the others wrong. So it's possible that the word has only one U and one Y, but we don't know for sure.

Given the constraints, we should avoid using U and Y again in other positions unless necessary, because we already know about them. We want to test new letters.

So for the next guess, we should try to use new letters from the allowed set to get more information.

Allowed letters for new positions: B, F, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need to form a word that fits the pattern: _ U _ _ Y

And uses only letters from the allowed set (and we can use U and Y only if necessary, but we already have them in the correct positions, so we can use other letters to test).

But note: the word must be a valid English word.

Let's think of words that end with Y and have U as the second letter.

Pattern: ?U??Y

We can try:

- BUY? But that's 3 letters. We need 5 letters.

5-letter words: 

- BULKY? But we know B is allowed, U is fixed, L is allowed, K is allowed, Y is fixed. But ""BULKY"" has 5 letters: B-U-L-K-Y. However, we have feedback that L and K are not excluded? We haven't tested L and K yet. But in ""pudgy"", we didn't test L and K. So ""BULKY"" is a candidate? But wait, we have to check if it uses any excluded letters.

""BULKY"": B, U, L, K, Y. 
- B: allowed (not excluded)
- U: in word, correct position
- L: allowed (not excluded)
- K: allowed (not excluded)
- Y: in word, correct position

But we are not sure if L and K are in the word. We are guessing to test.

However, we are on the fourth guess, and we have two correct letters. We can try to guess the word if we have a good candidate.

But let's see other possibilities.

Other words: 
- FUNKY: F, U, N, K, Y -> but N is excluded (from ""crane"": N(x)), so invalid.
- JUMBO: J, U, M, B, O -> M and O excluded.
- JUMPY: J, U, M, P, Y -> M and P excluded.
- LUCKY: L, U, C, K, Y -> C excluded.
- PUSHY: P, U, S, H, Y -> P and S excluded.
- BUSHY: B, U, S, H, Y -> S excluded.
- FUSSY: F, U, S, S, Y -> S excluded.
- GULPY: G, U, L, P, Y -> G and P excluded.
- HUSKY: H, U, S, K, Y -> S excluded.
- MUSKY: M, U, S, K, Y -> M and S excluded.
- PULPY: P, U, L, P, Y -> P excluded.
- WUSSY: W, U, S, S, Y -> S excluded.

Now, with the allowed letters, what can we have?

We need words with second letter U and last letter Y, and the other letters from {B, F, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z}.

Let me list possible words:

- BULKY: B, U, L, K, Y -> all allowed? B, L, K are not excluded. So yes.
- FUNKY: but N excluded.
- JUNKY: J, U, N, K, Y -> N excluded.
- KUDZU: K, U, D, Z, U -> D excluded, and also two U's? But D is excluded. Invalid.
- LUMMY: not a word? and M excluded.
- PUPPY: P excluded.
- QUAKY: Q, U, A, K, Y -> A excluded.
- QUICK: I and C excluded.
- QUIRK: Q, U, I, R, K -> I and R excluded.
- QUIPY: not a word? and P excluded if we consider, but also I excluded.
- VUGHY: not a word.
- WURST: W, U, R, S, T -> R, S, T excluded.
- ZAPPY: Z, A, P, P, Y -> A and P excluded.

Another word: ""BUHLY""? Not common.

""BURLY"": B, U, R, L, Y -> but R is excluded (from ""crane"": R(x)).

""FULLY"": F, U, L, L, Y -> but L is allowed? F, U, L, L, Y. But we have two L's. And F is allowed. However, we don't know if L is in the word. But ""FULLY"" is a word.

But note: the pattern is _ U _ _ Y. So positions: 1: F, 2: U (fixed), 3: L, 4: L, 5: Y (fixed). But we have two L's. Is that allowed? Yes, but we don't know if the word has L.

Similarly, ""BULLY"": B, U, L, L, Y -> same as above.

But we have to check if L is excluded? No, L has not been tested yet.

Similarly, ""FURRY"": F, U, R, R, Y -> R excluded.

""HUFFY"": H, U, F, F, Y -> allowed? H, U, F, F, Y. F is allowed? Yes, F is not excluded. And H is allowed.

""HUFFY"" is a word (meaning easily offended).

Similarly, ""JUFFY""? Not a word.

""KUFFY""? Not a word.

""LUFFY"": L, U, F, F, Y -> allowed? L, U, F, F, Y. L and F allowed.

""LUFFY"" might be a word? In sailing, but not common. Prefer common words.

""PUFFY"": P excluded.

""WUFFY""? Not a word.

""BUFFY"": B, U, F, F, Y -> allowed? B, U, F, F, Y. B and F allowed.

""BUFFY"" is a word (a name or meaning covered with buff).

But we have two F's.

Another word: ""JUMBY""? J, U, M, B, Y -> M excluded.

""KUDOS"": K, U, D, O, S -> D, O, S excluded.

""QUADS"": Q, U, A, D, S -> A, D, S excluded.

""QUAFF"": Q, U, A, F, F -> A excluded.

""QUAKE"": Q, U, A, K, E -> A and E excluded.

""QUALM"": Q, U, A, L, M -> A and M excluded.

""QUARK"": Q, U, A, R, K -> A and R excluded.

""QUART"": Q, U, A, R, T -> A, R, T excluded.

""QUASH"": Q, U, A, S, H -> A and S excluded.

""QUASI"": Q, U, A, S, I -> A, S, I excluded.

""QUAYS"": Q, U, A, Y, S -> A and S excluded, and Y is already in position 5, but here it's in position 4? Not the same.

We need Y at the end.

""QUEUE"": Q, U, E, U, E -> E excluded.

""QUICK"": I and C excluded.

""QUIET"": Q, U, I, E, T -> I, E, T excluded.

""QUILL"": Q, U, I, L, L -> I excluded.

""QUINT"": Q, U, I, N, T -> I, N, T excluded.

""QUIRK"": Q, U, I, R, K -> I and R excluded.

""QUITE"": Q, U, I, T, E -> I, T, E excluded.

""QUOTA"": Q, U, O, T, A -> O, T, A excluded.

""QUOTH"": Q, U, O, T, H -> O, T excluded.

""VODKA"": V, O, D, K, A -> O, D, A excluded.

""WACKO"": W, A, C, K, O -> A, C, O excluded.

""WALTZ"": W, A, L, T, Z -> A, T excluded.

""WELCH"": W, E, L, C, H -> E, C excluded.

""WENCH"": W, E, N, C, H -> E, N, C excluded.

""WHACK"": W, H, A, C, K -> A, C excluded.

""WHELP"": W, H, E, L, P -> E, P excluded.

""WIMPY"": W, I, M, P, Y -> I, M, P excluded.

""WOMAN"": W, O, M, A, N -> O, M, A, N excluded.

""WORMY"": W, O, R, M, Y -> O, R, M excluded.

""YUCKY"": Y, U, C, K, Y -> C excluded, and Y is at position 1 and 5? But we need U at position 2.

Back to: we have a few candidates:

- BULKY: B, U, L, K, Y
- BULLY: B, U, L, L, Y
- BUFFY: B, U, F, F, Y
- FULLY: F, U, L, L, Y
- HUFFY: H, U, F, F, Y
- LUFFY: L, U, F, F, Y (if accepted)

But note: we have U and Y fixed, so we are only testing the first, third, and fourth letters.

We want to maximize information. If we use a word with repeated letters, we get less information about other letters.

For example, in ""BULLY"", we test B and L, but with two L's, if we get feedback, we might not know if L is in the word or not? Actually, if L is in the word, we might get a hit on one of the positions, but since they are the same, it might be confusing. But the feedback will show for each position.

But it's better to have distinct letters to test more.

So ""BULKY"" tests three distinct letters: B, L, K.

""BUFFY"" tests B and F (with F repeated).

""FULLY"" tests F and L (with L repeated).

So ""BULKY"" is better because it tests three new letters: B, L, K.

Similarly, we can consider ""KULAK"": K, U, L, A, K -> A excluded.

""VUGHY"" not a word.

""WUDUS"" not a word.

""XEROX"" has E and O excluded.

""ZILCH"": Z, I, L, C, H -> I and C excluded.

""ZINCY"": Z, I, N, C, Y -> I, N, C excluded.

""ZIPPY"": Z, I, P, P, Y -> I, P excluded.

""ZLOTY"": Z, L, O, T, Y -> O, T excluded.

""ZONKY"" not a word.

So ""BULKY"" seems a good candidate.

But we have to make sure that B, L, K are not excluded. They are not in the excluded list.

Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T,P,D,G.

So B, L, K are allowed.

Therefore, I will guess ""bulky"".

But note: in ""pudgy"", we had U and Y correct, so in ""bulky"", we have U and Y in the same positions, which is good. And we are testing B, L, K.

If the word is ""bulky"", we get it right. If not, we get feedback on B, L, K.

So let's go with that.

<guess>bulky</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent, so they are excluded.
- **Guess 2 (moist)**: All letters (M, O, I, S, T) are absent, so they are excluded.
- **Guess 3 (pudgy)**:
  - P and D are absent (excluded).
  - U is correct and in position 2.
  - Y is correct and in position 5.
  - G is absent (excluded).

**Key insights**:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ U _ _ Y` (U in position 2, Y in position 5).
- Excluded letters (cannot be in the word): C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T, P, D, G.
- Remaining possible letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z.
- Since U and Y are already confirmed, the next guess should prioritize testing new letters from the remaining set to gather information about positions 1, 3, and 4.

**Strategy for the next guess**:
- Focus on words matching `_ U _ _ Y` using untested letters (B, F, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z).
- Avoid repeating U and Y in other positions to maximize new information.
- Prefer words with distinct letters to test more possibilities at once.
- ""BULKY"" (B, U, L, K, Y) fits perfectly:
  - Tests three new letters: B (position 1), L (position 3), K (position 4).
  - All letters are from the allowed set and not excluded.
  - It is a valid English word (meaning taking up much space).

If ""BULKY"" is incorrect, the feedback on B, L, and K will significantly narrow down possibilities for the remaining guesses.

Similarly, Q and Z are rare.\n\nSo let\'s stick with more common letters: B, D, G, H, K, L, P, U, W, Y.\n\nWe can form:\n  ""PLUMB"" -> invalid because of M.\n  ""BLUSH"" -> B, L, U, S, H -> S excluded.\n\n  ""BULKY"" seems good: B, U, L, K, Y.\n\n  ""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y.\n\n  ""GLYPH"": G, L, Y, P, H.\n\n  ""WACKY"" -> W, A, C, K, Y -> A and C excluded.\n\n  ""DUMPY"" -> D, U, M, P, Y -> M excluded.\n\n  ""HUMAN"" -> H, U, M, A, N -> M, A, N excluded.\n\n  ""LUCID"" -> L, U, C, I, D -> C and I excluded.\n\n  ""PADDY"" -> P, A, D, D, Y -> A excluded.\n\n  ""BUDDY"" -> B, U, D, D, Y -> allowed? B, U, D, D, Y -> but two D\'s? It\'s valid, but we don\'t know if D is in the word.\n\n  ""BUGGY"" -> B, U, G, G, Y -> two G\'s.\n\n  ""FUGLY"" -> F, U, G, L, Y -> allowed? F, U, G, L, Y: none excluded.\n\n  ""FUDGY"" is also F, U, D, G, Y.\n\nI think ""PUDGY"" and ""BULKY"" are both good. Let\'s choose one.\n\nAlternatively, ""GLYPH"" is also good because it includes H, which is common.\n\nBut note: we are testing 5 new letters. We have 6 tries left? Actually, we are on the third guess (we have 4 more tries after this).\n\nI\'ll go with ""PUDGY"" because it has D and G, which are common.\n\nBut ""BULKY"" has B and K, which are also common.\n\nAnother word: ""WIMPY"" -> W, I, M, P, Y -> I and M excluded.\n\n  ""DUVET"" -> excluded letters.\n\n  ""GULCH"" -> G, U, L, C, H -> C excluded.\n\n  ""PULKA"" -> P, U, L, K, A -> A excluded.\n\n  ""YUKKY"" -> Y, U, K, K, Y -> two K\'s and two Y\'s? And K is allowed.\n\nBut ""YUKKY"" might not be a common word. We need a valid English word.\n\n""PUDGY"" is a valid word (meaning chubby).\n\n""BULKY"" is also valid.\n\n""GLYPH"" is valid (a symbol).\n\n""FUDGY"" is valid (resembling fudge).\n\nI think ""PUDGY"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency: \n  U is a vowel, and we haven\'t tested any vowel except A,E,I,O (which are excluded). So U is the only vowel left? And sometimes Y.\n\nThe secret word must have vowels. The only vowels left are U and Y (as a vowel).\n\nSo we need to test U and Y.\n\n""PUDGY"" has U and Y? No, it has U and Y (but Y is at the end, which can be a vowel). Actually, ""PUDGY"" has U as the vowel and Y as a consonant? But in any case, it tests both.\n\nSimilarly, ""BULKY"" has U and Y.\n\n""GLYPH"" has Y as a vowel? And no U.\n\nSo ""PUDGY"" and ""BULKY"" test U and Y.\n\nI\'ll go with ""pudgy"".\n\n<guess>pudgy</guess>After two guesses with all letters excluded (C, R, A, N, E from ""crane"" and M, O, I, S, T from ""moist""), the secret word must consist of letters from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. \n\nFor the third guess, I prioritized:\n- Avoiding all 10 excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T).\n- Testing new high-frequency consonants (e.g., P, D, G) and the only remaining common vowel (U), along with Y (which can act as a vowel).\n- Maximizing coverage of untested letters to gather more information.\n\nThe word ""pudgy"" was chosen because:\n- It uses 5 new letters: P, U, D, G, Y.\n- It is a valid English word (meaning slightly fat).\n- It tests U (a critical vowel candidate) and Y (a versatile letter).\n- It avoids rare letters (e.g., Q, Z, J) to increase the chance of hits.\n\nIf this guess also returns all misses, it will further narrow down the possibilities by excluding P, U, D, G, and Y.\n\n<guess>pudgy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: pudgy -> FEEDBACK: P(x) U(✓) D(x) G(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the third guess ""pudgy"":\n  P(x) -> P is not in the word.\n  U(✓) -> U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).\n  D(x) -> D is not in the word.\n  G(x) -> G is not in the word.\n  Y(✓) -> Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).\n\nSo, we know:\n- The word has U in the second position and Y in the fifth position.\n- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T, P, D, G (from previous feedback).\n\nAlso, from the current feedback, P, D, G are not in the word.\n\nTherefore, the secret word is of the form: _ U _ _ Y\n\nAnd the remaining letters that are possible: from the alphabet, excluding the known absent letters.\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T, P, D, G.\n\nSo allowed letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: U and Y are already in the word, so they might appear again? However, we don\'t have any indication of duplicates yet. Since we have U and Y placed, and they are correct, we can assume they are single for now, but we should be cautious.\n\nThe word has at least U and Y, and we know their positions.\n\nWe need to fill the first, third, and fourth positions.\n\nThe word: [letter1] U [letter3] [letter4] Y\n\nWe must choose letter1, letter3, letter4 from the allowed set: B, F, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z (note: U and Y are already used, but we can use them again? The feedback doesn\'t say anything about duplicates, so we cannot rule out duplicates. However, since we have U and Y already placed and correct, if there were duplicates, we might have gotten feedback for them. But in ""pudgy"", we only had U and Y correct, and the others wrong. So it\'s possible that the word has only one U and one Y, but we don\'t know for sure.\n\nGiven the constraints, we should avoid using U and Y again in other positions unless necessary, because we already know about them. We want to test new letters.\n\nSo for the next guess, we should try to use new letters from the allowed set to get more information.\n\nAllowed letters for new positions: B, F, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z.\n\nWe need to form a word that fits the pattern: _ U _ _ Y\n\nAnd uses only letters from the allowed set (and we can use U and Y only if necessary, but we already have them in the correct positions, so we can use other letters to test).\n\nBut note: the word must be a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s think of words that end with Y and have U as the second letter.\n\nPattern: ?U??Y\n\nWe can try:\n\n- BUY? But that\'s 3 letters. We need 5 letters.\n\n5-letter words: \n\n- BULKY? But we know B is allowed, U is fixed, L is allowed, K is allowed, Y is fixed. But ""BULKY"" has 5 letters: B-U-L-K-Y. However, we have feedback that L and K are not excluded? We haven\'t tested L and K yet. But in ""pudgy"", we didn\'t test L and K. So ""BULKY"" is a candidate? But wait, we have to check if it uses any excluded letters.\n\n""BULKY"": B, U, L, K, Y. \n- B: allowed (not excluded)\n- U: in word, correct position\n- L: allowed (not excluded)\n- K: allowed (not excluded)\n- Y: in word, correct position\n\nBut we are not sure if L and K are in the word. We are guessing to test.\n\nHowever, we are on the fourth guess, and we have two correct letters. We can try to guess the word if we have a good candidate.\n\nBut let\'s see other possibilities.\n\nOther words: \n- FUNKY: F, U, N, K, Y -> but N is excluded (from ""crane"": N(x)), so invalid.\n- JUMBO: J, U, M, B, O -> M and O excluded.\n- JUMPY: J, U, M, P, Y -> M and P excluded.\n- LUCKY: L, U, C, K, Y -> C excluded.\n- PUSHY: P, U, S, H, Y -> P and S excluded.\n- BUSHY: B, U, S, H, Y -> S excluded.\n- FUSSY: F, U, S, S, Y -> S excluded.\n- GULPY: G, U, L, P, Y -> G and P excluded.\n- HUSKY: H, U, S, K, Y -> S excluded.\n- MUSKY: M, U, S, K, Y -> M and S excluded.\n- PULPY: P, U, L, P, Y -> P excluded.\n- WUSSY: W, U, S, S, Y -> S excluded.\n\nNow, with the allowed letters, what can we have?\n\nWe need words with second letter U and last letter Y, and the other letters from {B, F, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z}.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n\n- BULKY: B, U, L, K, Y -> all allowed?

But we need U at position 2.\n\nBack to: we have a few candidates:\n\n- BULKY: B, U, L, K, Y\n- BULLY: B, U, L, L, Y\n- BUFFY: B, U, F, F, Y\n- FULLY: F, U, L, L, Y\n- HUFFY: H, U, F, F, Y\n- LUFFY: L, U, F, F, Y (if accepted)\n\nBut note: we have U and Y fixed, so we are only testing the first, third, and fourth letters.\n\nWe want to maximize information. If we use a word with repeated letters, we get less information about other letters.\n\nFor example, in ""BULLY"", we test B and L, but with two L\'s, if we get feedback, we might not know if L is in the word or not? Actually, if L is in the word, we might get a hit on one of the positions, but since they are the same, it might be confusing. But the feedback will show for each position.\n\nBut it\'s better to have distinct letters to test more.\n\nSo ""BULKY"" tests three distinct letters: B, L, K.\n\n""BUFFY"" tests B and F (with F repeated).\n\n""FULLY"" tests F and L (with L repeated).\n\nSo ""BULKY"" is better because it tests three new letters: B, L, K.\n\nSimilarly, we can consider ""KULAK"": K, U, L, A, K -> A excluded.\n\n""VUGHY"" not a word.\n\n""WUDUS"" not a word.\n\n""XEROX"" has E and O excluded.\n\n""ZILCH"": Z, I, L, C, H -> I and C excluded.\n\n""ZINCY"": Z, I, N, C, Y -> I, N, C excluded.\n\n""ZIPPY"": Z, I, P, P, Y -> I, P excluded.\n\n""ZLOTY"": Z, L, O, T, Y -> O, T excluded.\n\n""ZONKY"" not a word.\n\nSo ""BULKY"" seems a good candidate.\n\nBut we have to make sure that B, L, K are not excluded. They are not in the excluded list.\n\nExcluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T,P,D,G.\n\nSo B, L, K are allowed.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""bulky"".\n\nBut note: in ""pudgy"", we had U and Y correct, so in ""bulky"", we have U and Y in the same positions, which is good. And we are testing B, L, K.\n\nIf the word is ""bulky"", we get it right. If not, we get feedback on B, L, K.\n\nSo let\'s go with that.\n\n<guess>bulky</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent, so they are excluded.\n- **Guess 2 (moist)**: All letters (M, O, I, S, T) are absent, so they are excluded.\n- **Guess 3 (pudgy)**:\n  - P and D are absent (excluded).\n  - U is correct and in position 2.\n  - Y is correct and in position 5.\n  - G is absent (excluded).\n\n**Key insights**:\n- The secret word has the pattern: `_ U _ _ Y` (U in position 2, Y in position 5).\n- Excluded letters (cannot be in the word): C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T, P, D, G.\n- Remaining possible letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z.\n- Since U and Y are already confirmed, the next guess should prioritize testing new letters from the remaining set to gather information about positions 1, 3, and 4.\n\n**Strategy for the next guess**:\n- Focus on words matching `_ U _ _ Y` using untested letters (B, F, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z).\n- Avoid repeating U and Y in other positions to maximize new information.\n- Prefer words with distinct letters to test more possibilities at once.\n- ""BULKY"" (B, U, L, K, Y) fits perfectly:\n  - Tests three new letters: B (position 1), L (position 3), K (position 4).\n  - All letters are from the allowed set and not excluded.\n  - It is a valid English word (meaning taking up much space).\n\nIf ""BULKY"" is incorrect, the feedback on B, L, and K will significantly narrow down possibilities for the remaining guesses.\n\n<guess>bulky</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: pudgy -> FEEDBACK: P(x) U(✓) D(x) G(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: bulky -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) U(✓) L(✓) K(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from the fourth guess: bulky -> B(✓) U(✓) L(✓) K(x) Y(✓)
 This means:
  B is correct and in position 1.
  U is correct and in position 2 (we knew this).
  L is correct and in position 3.
  K is not in the word.
  Y is correct and in position 5 (we knew this).

So the secret word is: B U L _ Y

We also know that K is not in the word, so we exclude K.

Previously excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T, P, D, G, and now K.

The word we have: BULLY? Not yet, because the fourth letter is missing.

But note: the word must be ""BULxY"", where x is the fourth letter, which must be from the remaining possible letters.

Remaining possible letters: F, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Z (since B, U, L, Y are in the word and in the correct positions).

We know K is excluded now.

Previously allowed letters were B, F, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z, but we used B, L, and excluded K.

So now available letters for the fourth position: F, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form BUL?Y.

Let's think of words that fit ""BUL_Y"":

- BULGY? But G is excluded (from pudgy: G(x)).
- BULKY? We tried and K is excluded (K(x) in bulky).
- BULLY: B,U,L,L,Y -> but the fourth letter is L. However, L is already in position 3. Is that possible? Yes, duplicate letters.

But in ""bulky"", we had L in position 3 correct. Does that mean L can appear again? But in ""bulky"", the feedback for L was only in position 3 (since it was marked correct there). There was no L in position 4 to test.

For ""BULLY"": it would be B(✓), U(✓), L(✓) for the first L, and then the second L in position 4? We don't know if that would be correct or not.

Other words:

- BULKY we know is wrong because of K.
- BULSE? Not a word, and S excluded.
- BULBS? B is repeated? And S excluded? Also not ending with Y.
- BULGE: E and G excluded.
- BULKS: K and S excluded.

Common words ending with Y: BULLY is a word.

We have to consider ""BULLY"". The pattern is B U L L Y.

In this case, position 4 is L again.

Is L allowed to be repeated? Yes, because we don't have feedback that it can't be.

Other possibilities? 

- BURRY? But R excluded and not correct pattern.
- None with F,H,J,Q,V,W,X,Z? 

Let's check:

- Bulfy? Not a word.
- Bulhy? Not a word.
- Buljy? Not a word.
- Bulqy? Not a word.
- Bulvy? Not a word.
- Bulwy? Not a word.
- Bulxy? Not a word.
- Bulzy? Not a word.

Therefore, the only common word left is ""BULLY"".

Moreover, we have three positions correct: B U L _ Y. If we place L in the fourth position, we get B U L L Y.

In the fourth guess ""bulky"", we got B(✓), U(✓), L(✓) for positions 1,2,3, and K(x), Y(✓).

This means that the L is confirmed only in position 3, but it could be elsewhere too? Actually, the feedback for ""bulky"" does not prohibit an additional L.

Therefore, ""BULLY"" is a valid candidate.

To confirm, we know the fourth letter must be from the set: F,H,J,Q,V,W,X,Z. But none of these form valid words with the pattern BUL?Y.

Except BULLY with ?=L.

But L is a letter we know is in the word, and we haven't tested it in other positions.

So our next guess should be ""bully"".

If we are wrong, we get more information. If we are right, we win.

Given that we have limited tries, and ""BULLY"" fits all, we go for it.

<guess>bully</guess>
</think>
Based on the accumulated feedback:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) excluded → not in the word.
- **Guess 2 (moist)**: All letters (M, O, I, S, T) excluded → not in the word.
- **Guess 3 (pudgy)**:
  - U is correct and in position 2.
  - Y is correct and in position 5.
  - P, D, G excluded → not in the word.
- **Guess 4 (bulky)**:
  - B, U, L correct in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.
  - K excluded → not in the word.
  - Y confirmed in position 5.

**Key deductions**:
- The secret word has the pattern: **B U L _ Y** (B in position 1, U in position 2, L in position 3, Y in position 5).
- Total excluded letters (19): C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T, P, D, G, K.
- Remaining possible letters for position 4: F, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Z. 
- However, no common English words fit ""BUL_Y"" using these letters (e.g., ""Bulfy"", ""Buljy"", etc., are invalid).
- The only common English word matching the pattern is **BULLY**, where the fourth letter is another L. This is plausible because:
  - L was confirmed in position 3 during Guess 4 (""bulky""), but it could appear elsewhere.
  - ""BULLY"" complies with all feedback: B, U, L (first occurrence), L (second occurrence), Y.
- Guessing ""BULLY"" tests for a double-L scenario—if correct, it wins; if wrong, the feedback will provide new information about position 4.

<guess>bully</guess>",bully,"We have feedback from the fourth guess: bulky -> B(✓) U(✓) L(✓) K(x) Y(✓)
 This means:
  B is correct and in position 1.
  U is correct and in position 2 (we knew this).
  L is correct and in position 3.
  K is not in the word.
  Y is correct and in position 5 (we knew this).

So the secret word is: B U L _ Y

We also know that K is not in the word, so we exclude K.

Previously excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T, P, D, G, and now K.

The word we have: BULLY? Not yet, because the fourth letter is missing.

But note: the word must be ""BULxY"", where x is the fourth letter, which must be from the remaining possible letters.

Remaining possible letters: F, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Z (since B, U, L, Y are in the word and in the correct positions).

We know K is excluded now.

Previously allowed letters were B, F, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z, but we used B, L, and excluded K.

So now available letters for the fourth position: F, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form BUL?Y.

Let's think of words that fit ""BUL_Y"":

- BULGY? But G is excluded (from pudgy: G(x)).
- BULKY? We tried and K is excluded (K(x) in bulky).
- BULLY: B,U,L,L,Y -> but the fourth letter is L. However, L is already in position 3. Is that possible? Yes, duplicate letters.

But in ""bulky"", we had L in position 3 correct. Does that mean L can appear again? But in ""bulky"", the feedback for L was only in position 3 (since it was marked correct there). There was no L in position 4 to test.

For ""BULLY"": it would be B(✓), U(✓), L(✓) for the first L, and then the second L in position 4? We don't know if that would be correct or not.

Other words:

- BULKY we know is wrong because of K.
- BULSE? Not a word, and S excluded.
- BULBS? B is repeated? And S excluded? Also not ending with Y.
- BULGE: E and G excluded.
- BULKS: K and S excluded.

Common words ending with Y: BULLY is a word.

We have to consider ""BULLY"". The pattern is B U L L Y.

In this case, position 4 is L again.

Is L allowed to be repeated? Yes, because we don't have feedback that it can't be.

Other possibilities? 

- BURRY? But R excluded and not correct pattern.
- None with F,H,J,Q,V,W,X,Z? 

Let's check:

- Bulfy? Not a word.
- Bulhy? Not a word.
- Buljy? Not a word.
- Bulqy? Not a word.
- Bulvy? Not a word.
- Bulwy? Not a word.
- Bulxy? Not a word.
- Bulzy? Not a word.

Therefore, the only common word left is ""BULLY"".

Moreover, we have three positions correct: B U L _ Y. If we place L in the fourth position, we get B U L L Y.

In the fourth guess ""bulky"", we got B(✓), U(✓), L(✓) for positions 1,2,3, and K(x), Y(✓).

This means that the L is confirmed only in position 3, but it could be elsewhere too? Actually, the feedback for ""bulky"" does not prohibit an additional L.

Therefore, ""BULLY"" is a valid candidate.

To confirm, we know the fourth letter must be from the set: F,H,J,Q,V,W,X,Z. But none of these form valid words with the pattern BUL?Y.

Except BULLY with ?=L.

But L is a letter we know is in the word, and we haven't tested it in other positions.

So our next guess should be ""bully"".

If we are wrong, we get more information. If we are right, we win.

Given that we have limited tries, and ""BULLY"" fits all, we go for it.

<guess>bully</guess>Based on the accumulated feedback:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) excluded → not in the word.
- **Guess 2 (moist)**: All letters (M, O, I, S, T) excluded → not in the word.
- **Guess 3 (pudgy)**:
  - U is correct and in position 2.
  - Y is correct and in position 5.
  - P, D, G excluded → not in the word.
- **Guess 4 (bulky)**:
  - B, U, L correct in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.
  - K excluded → not in the word.
  - Y confirmed in position 5.

**Key deductions**:
- The secret word has the pattern: **B U L _ Y** (B in position 1, U in position 2, L in position 3, Y in position 5).
- Total excluded letters (19): C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T, P, D, G, K.
- Remaining possible letters for position 4: F, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Z. 
- However, no common English words fit ""BUL_Y"" using these letters (e.g., ""Bulfy"", ""Buljy"", etc., are invalid).
- The only common English word matching the pattern is **BULLY**, where the fourth letter is another L. This is plausible because:
  - L was confirmed in position 3 during Guess 4 (""bulky""), but it could appear elsewhere.
  - ""BULLY"" complies with all feedback: B, U, L (first occurrence), L (second occurrence), Y.
- Guessing ""BULLY"" tests for a double-L scenario—if correct, it wins; if wrong, the feedback will provide new information about position 4.",Guess 5: bully -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) U(✓) L(✓) L(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
