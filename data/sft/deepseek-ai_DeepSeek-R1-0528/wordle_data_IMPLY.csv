We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left. We can consider other vowels and consonants.
 Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)
 Consonants: We have many left, such as B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should try to cover as many common letters as possible. A good second guess might include letters like S, T, L, O, P, etc.

 Let me try to form a word without the forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E). Some options:

 Option 1: ""SPLIT"" - contains S, P, L, I, T. All these are not in the forbidden set.
 Option 2: ""MOUTH"" - M, O, U, T, H.
 Option 3: ""BUMPY"" - B, U, M, P, Y.

 However, we want to maximize the information we get. Since we have no correct letters, we should try to include frequent letters that we haven't tried.

 According to letter frequency in English, some of the most common letters (excluding the ones we've tried) are: S, T, L, O, P, I, etc.

 Let me choose a word that has as many of these as possible. ""SPLIT"" has S, P, L, I, T. That's five common letters.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" has P, I, O, U, S. But note that we haven't tried O, U, I, S, P.

 Another option: ""TOILS"" - T, O, I, L, S.

 But note: we must avoid E, A, R, N, C. All these words do avoid them.

 I think ""SPLIT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we haven't tried any of them.

 However, let me check if ""SPLIT"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.

 Alternatively, we could use ""SHIPT"" but that's not a word. Or ""SLIPT"" which is an archaic form of slipped? Better to stick with common words.

 Another common starting word that avoids these letters is ""MOIST"" (M, O, I, S, T). That also covers common letters.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels? We haven't tried O, U, I. ""MOIST"" has O and I.

 Let me compare:
   ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T -> we get information about S, P, L, I, T.
   ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> we get M, O, I, S, T.

 Both are good. I'll go with ""SPLIT"" for now.

 However, note that the feedback for the first word was all wrong, so the secret word has none of the letters in ""CRANE"". Therefore, we must avoid those.

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" – all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these.
2. ""split"" – S(x), P(-), L(-), I(-), T(x). This means:
   - S and T are not in the word at all (x).
   - P, L, I are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

Therefore, the secret word contains the letters P, L, I, but not S, T, and also not any of C, R, A, N, E from the first guess.

Additionally, the positions in ""split"" are:
  Position 1: S (wrong) – but we now know S is absent, so position 1 cannot be S.
  Position 2: P (wrong position) – so P is in the word but not in position 2.
  Position 3: L (wrong position) – L is in the word but not in position 3.
  Position 4: I (wrong position) – I is in the word but not in position 4.
  Position 5: T (wrong) – T is absent.

We also know that the word must contain exactly three letters from ""split"": P, L, I. The other two letters are unknown but must be from the remaining alphabet excluding:
  Forbidden: C, R, A, N, E, S, T (from the feedback of both guesses).

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains P, L, I (all three) and two other letters from the available set.
- P is not in position 2, L not in position 3, I not in position 4.
- Also, remember the positions: We have constraints on where P, L, I cannot be.

We should try to put P, L, I in different positions and include two new common letters to test more.

Possible approach:
- Since P, L, I must be in the word, we can try to form a word that rearranges P, L, I and adds two new letters. The new letters should be common to increase chances of getting more information.

Available common letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U.

Let me think of words that have P, L, I and two of these.

Possible words:
- ""PILOT"": But wait, we know I cannot be in position 4 (from feedback: I was in position 4 and was wrong position). Also, P cannot be in position 2? In ""split"", P was in position 2 and it was wrong. But note: in a new word, we can put P elsewhere. However, ""PILOT"" has P in position 1, I in position 2, L in position 3. But the feedback said L cannot be in position 3? Wait: the feedback only tells us that in the word ""split"", L was in position 3 and that was wrong. So in the secret word, L is not in position 3. Similarly, I is not in position 4. But that doesn't prevent L in position 3 in a future guess? Actually, the feedback for ""split"" says that L is in the word but not at position 3. Therefore, in the secret word, L is present but not in position 3. The same for P: present but not in position 2, and I: present but not in position 4.

So in a new guess, we can put L in position 1,2,4,5; I in position 1,2,3,5; P in position 1,3,4,5.

Now, checking ""PILOT"": 
  Position 1: P -> but in feedback, P was not at 2, but can be at 1? 
  However, we have forbidden S and T. Also, O is allowed? But ""PILOT"" has O and T, but T is forbidden? T was in ""split"" and marked as absent, so T cannot be in the word. Therefore, ""PILOT"" contains T, which is forbidden. So invalid.

Another word: ""OPIUM""? Let's see: O, P, I, U, M. 
  Letters: O, P, I, U, M. All are allowed? We haven't ruled out O, U, M. And no T or S or forbidden. But does it contain L? No. We need L because the feedback says L is in the word. So we must include L.

We must have P, L, I all.

So words that have P, L, I and two more from available.

Common words: 
  ""PLAID"" – but A is forbidden (from ""crane"" feedback, A is absent).
  ""PLUMB"" – B is allowed, U and M allowed? But: P,L,U,M,B. Contains L and P and U,M,B, but missing I? We need I too.

Actually, the word must contain P, L, and I. So we need a word with all three.

Let me search for words with P, L, I and two other letters from B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Examples:
  ""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> contains B,L,I,M,P. Note: B, M allowed. 
    Position: 
      1: B -> new
      2: L -> but in ""split"", L was in position 3 and wrong? Now we put L in position 2? Is that allowed? Yes, because the feedback only said position 3 was wrong, so L could be in 2.
    This word: BLIMP
    Positions: 1: B, 2: L, 3: I, 4: M, 5: P.
    Constraints:
      P cannot be in position 2? It was in position 2 and wrong. Now P is in position 5, which is allowed.
      L cannot be in position 3? Here it's in position 2, so okay.
      I cannot be in position 4? Here it's in position 3, so okay.
    Also, we avoid forbidden letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,T.

  ""GUILD"" – but has U,I,L,D, but missing P? And we need P.

  ""PLINK"": P, L, I, N, K – but N is forbidden? From ""crane"", N is absent so forbidden. Also, K is allowed.

Let's avoid N.

  ""BLIPS"": S is forbidden? From ""split"" feedback, S is absent. So S cannot be used.

  ""GLIMP"": not a word? 

  ""LIMPS"": again S forbidden.

  ""BUILD"" – B,U,I,L,D – no P.

  ""QUIPL"": not a word.

  ""PLIED"": P,L,I,E,D – but E is forbidden? E is in forbidden list from first guess.

  ""FLIPS"": S forbidden.

  ""CLIPS"": C and S forbidden.

  ""JUMPS"": has U,M,P,J,S? S forbidden.

Another idea: ""WHIMS"" – has W,H,I,M,S – S forbidden and no P,L.

Back to ""BLIMP"": it seems valid. It's a word (blimp is a type of airship). Letters B,L,I,M,P.

So let's consider ""BLIMP"". 

By guessing ""BLIMP"", we test:
  B (new), L (known but different position - was in 3, now in 2), I (known, was in 4, now in 3), M (new), P (known, was in 2, now in 5).

This would give us information about these positions and the letters B and M.

Alternatively, we might think of other words. What about ""MILKY""? But K and Y allowed? And we don't have P. Must have P.

Another word: ""OILED"" – but E and D? E forbidden.

What about ""DOILY""? D,O,I,L,Y – has I,L but no P. And missing P.

Another: ""POLIO""? P,O,L,I,O – has P,O,L,I,O. Letters: P, O, L, I. Two O's? That's allowed. But O is new? 
  Positions: 
    1: P -> P is not in position 2? Now in 1, okay.
    2: O
    3: L -> but feedback said L cannot be in position 3? In ""split"", L was in position 3 and it was wrong. So if we put L in position 3, it might again be wrong? But that's okay, we can test. Actually, the constraint is that in the secret word L is not in position 3. But in our guess, we are free to put L anywhere? However, if we put L in position 3 again and it's still wrong, we won't get new position info. Also, we know it's wrong because we know L is not in position 3 in the secret word? Actually, yes: we already know that position 3 is not L for the secret word. So it would be redundant to put L in position 3? And we might get a '-' meaning present but wrong position? But we already know it's not in position 3? So it would tell us nothing new? 

However, the feedback might tell us about the position but we already know it's not 3? So it might be a waste? 

We should avoid putting L in position 3 because we know it's not correct. Similarly, avoid P in 2 and I in 4.

In ""POLIO"": 
  Position 1: P -> okay (because P was in 2 and wrong, but we can try position 1? It's not forbidden for P to be at 1? The feedback only said position 2 was wrong for P, so 1 is unknown.
  Position 3: L -> we know that in the secret word, L is not at 3? And our feedback will tell us: if we put L at 3, and it's wrong, we expect that. So we don't learn anything? Actually, we wouldn't learn. So better to put L in a different position.

Also, ""POLIO"" has two O's? But that uses one new letter O? And repeats O? We don't know if O is in the word? So it might not be efficient? We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Therefore, ""BLIMP"" might be better: it introduces two new letters (B and M) and moves P, L, I to new positions?

Let me write the positions of ""BLIMP"":

Index: 1: B, 2: L, 3: I, 4: M, 5: P

Now, constraints from previous feedback:
- P was in position 2 and wrong -> so in secret, P is not at 2. Now we put P at 5: okay.
- L was in position 3 and wrong -> secret L not at 3. Now we put L at 2: okay (we are testing a new position).
- I was in position 4 and wrong -> secret I not at 4. Now we put I at 3: okay (testing a new position).

Also, we are testing B at 1 and M at 4, which are new.

So ""BLIMP"" is a good candidate.

But let me double-check: we have the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T. ""blimp"" contains B, L, I, M, P. None forbidden. And L, I, P are confirmed to be in the word? Well, the feedback from ""split"" says P, L, I are in the word. So including them is good.

So I'll guess ""BLIMP"".

But note: the word must be a valid English word. ""blimp"" is valid.

Alternatively, are there other words? For example, ""PILLY""? But L repeated? And we don't know if there are repeated letters? Also, Y is allowed? ""PILLY"" has two L's? And would push P to position 1? But wait: 
  P in 1, I in 2, L in 3 and 4? But we already know L cannot be in position 3? So if we put L in position 3, then the feedback might not be as informative? And we have position 3 L? Which we know is wrong? Also, we haven't tried Y? 

But I think ""BLIMP"" is better because it doesn't repeat letters and we get to test B and M.

Another word: ""GULPY""? G,U,L,P,Y. Has U? But missing I? Must have I.

""BLIPY"" not a word.

So I'll go with ""BLIMP"".

<guess>blimp</guess>
</think>
The feedback indicates:
- Letters **P, L, I** are in the secret word but not at positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
- Letters **S, T, C, R, A, N, E** are NOT in the secret word.

For the next guess, I need a word containing **P, L, I** and avoiding forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E, S, T). The word must place P, L, I in positions that don't conflict with known constraints (e.g., P not at position 2, L not at position 3, I not at position 4).

I chose **""blimp""** because:
- Contains the required P, L, I and introduces two new common letters (B, M).
- Positions: B (new at 1), L (at 2; was previously position 3), I (at 3; was previously position 4), M (new at 4), P (at 5; was previously position 2).
- This avoids known incorrect positions: L is not at 3, I is not at 4, P is not at 2.
- Tests high-frequency letters B and M while adhering to known constraints.

This guess maximizes new information about the secret word's composition and structure.

<guess>blimp</guess>",blimp,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" – all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these.
2. ""split"" – S(x), P(-), L(-), I(-), T(x). This means:
   - S and T are not in the word at all (x).
   - P, L, I are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

Therefore, the secret word contains the letters P, L, I, but not S, T, and also not any of C, R, A, N, E from the first guess.

Additionally, the positions in ""split"" are:
  Position 1: S (wrong) – but we now know S is absent, so position 1 cannot be S.
  Position 2: P (wrong position) – so P is in the word but not in position 2.
  Position 3: L (wrong position) – L is in the word but not in position 3.
  Position 4: I (wrong position) – I is in the word but not in position 4.
  Position 5: T (wrong) – T is absent.

We also know that the word must contain exactly three letters from ""split"": P, L, I. The other two letters are unknown but must be from the remaining alphabet excluding:
  Forbidden: C, R, A, N, E, S, T (from the feedback of both guesses).

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains P, L, I (all three) and two other letters from the available set.
- P is not in position 2, L not in position 3, I not in position 4.
- Also, remember the positions: We have constraints on where P, L, I cannot be.

We should try to put P, L, I in different positions and include two new common letters to test more.

Possible approach:
- Since P, L, I must be in the word, we can try to form a word that rearranges P, L, I and adds two new letters. The new letters should be common to increase chances of getting more information.

Available common letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U.

Let me think of words that have P, L, I and two of these.

Possible words:
- ""PILOT"": But wait, we know I cannot be in position 4 (from feedback: I was in position 4 and was wrong position). Also, P cannot be in position 2? In ""split"", P was in position 2 and it was wrong. But note: in a new word, we can put P elsewhere. However, ""PILOT"" has P in position 1, I in position 2, L in position 3. But the feedback said L cannot be in position 3? Wait: the feedback only tells us that in the word ""split"", L was in position 3 and that was wrong. So in the secret word, L is not in position 3. Similarly, I is not in position 4. But that doesn't prevent L in position 3 in a future guess? Actually, the feedback for ""split"" says that L is in the word but not at position 3. Therefore, in the secret word, L is present but not in position 3. The same for P: present but not in position 2, and I: present but not in position 4.

So in a new guess, we can put L in position 1,2,4,5; I in position 1,2,3,5; P in position 1,3,4,5.

Now, checking ""PILOT"": 
  Position 1: P -> but in feedback, P was not at 2, but can be at 1? 
  However, we have forbidden S and T. Also, O is allowed? But ""PILOT"" has O and T, but T is forbidden? T was in ""split"" and marked as absent, so T cannot be in the word. Therefore, ""PILOT"" contains T, which is forbidden. So invalid.

Another word: ""OPIUM""? Let's see: O, P, I, U, M. 
  Letters: O, P, I, U, M. All are allowed? We haven't ruled out O, U, M. And no T or S or forbidden. But does it contain L? No. We need L because the feedback says L is in the word. So we must include L.

We must have P, L, I all.

So words that have P, L, I and two more from available.

Common words: 
  ""PLAID"" – but A is forbidden (from ""crane"" feedback, A is absent).
  ""PLUMB"" – B is allowed, U and M allowed? But: P,L,U,M,B. Contains L and P and U,M,B, but missing I? We need I too.

Actually, the word must contain P, L, and I. So we need a word with all three.

Let me search for words with P, L, I and two other letters from B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Examples:
  ""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> contains B,L,I,M,P. Note: B, M allowed. 
    Position: 
      1: B -> new
      2: L -> but in ""split"", L was in position 3 and wrong? Now we put L in position 2? Is that allowed? Yes, because the feedback only said position 3 was wrong, so L could be in 2.
    This word: BLIMP
    Positions: 1: B, 2: L, 3: I, 4: M, 5: P.
    Constraints:
      P cannot be in position 2? It was in position 2 and wrong. Now P is in position 5, which is allowed.
      L cannot be in position 3? Here it's in position 2, so okay.
      I cannot be in position 4? Here it's in position 3, so okay.
    Also, we avoid forbidden letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,T.

  ""GUILD"" – but has U,I,L,D, but missing P? And we need P.

  ""PLINK"": P, L, I, N, K – but N is forbidden? From ""crane"", N is absent so forbidden. Also, K is allowed.

Let's avoid N.

  ""BLIPS"": S is forbidden? From ""split"" feedback, S is absent. So S cannot be used.

  ""GLIMP"": not a word? 

  ""LIMPS"": again S forbidden.

  ""BUILD"" – B,U,I,L,D – no P.

  ""QUIPL"": not a word.

  ""PLIED"": P,L,I,E,D – but E is forbidden? E is in forbidden list from first guess.

  ""FLIPS"": S forbidden.

  ""CLIPS"": C and S forbidden.

  ""JUMPS"": has U,M,P,J,S? S forbidden.

Another idea: ""WHIMS"" – has W,H,I,M,S – S forbidden and no P,L.

Back to ""BLIMP"": it seems valid. It's a word (blimp is a type of airship). Letters B,L,I,M,P.

So let's consider ""BLIMP"". 

By guessing ""BLIMP"", we test:
  B (new), L (known but different position - was in 3, now in 2), I (known, was in 4, now in 3), M (new), P (known, was in 2, now in 5).

This would give us information about these positions and the letters B and M.

Alternatively, we might think of other words. What about ""MILKY""? But K and Y allowed? And we don't have P. Must have P.

Another word: ""OILED"" – but E and D? E forbidden.

What about ""DOILY""? D,O,I,L,Y – has I,L but no P. And missing P.

Another: ""POLIO""? P,O,L,I,O – has P,O,L,I,O. Letters: P, O, L, I. Two O's? That's allowed. But O is new? 
  Positions: 
    1: P -> P is not in position 2? Now in 1, okay.
    2: O
    3: L -> but feedback said L cannot be in position 3? In ""split"", L was in position 3 and it was wrong. So if we put L in position 3, it might again be wrong? But that's okay, we can test. Actually, the constraint is that in the secret word L is not in position 3. But in our guess, we are free to put L anywhere? However, if we put L in position 3 again and it's still wrong, we won't get new position info. Also, we know it's wrong because we know L is not in position 3 in the secret word? Actually, yes: we already know that position 3 is not L for the secret word. So it would be redundant to put L in position 3? And we might get a '-' meaning present but wrong position? But we already know it's not in position 3? So it would tell us nothing new? 

However, the feedback might tell us about the position but we already know it's not 3? So it might be a waste? 

We should avoid putting L in position 3 because we know it's not correct. Similarly, avoid P in 2 and I in 4.

In ""POLIO"": 
  Position 1: P -> okay (because P was in 2 and wrong, but we can try position 1? It's not forbidden for P to be at 1? The feedback only said position 2 was wrong for P, so 1 is unknown.
  Position 3: L -> we know that in the secret word, L is not at 3? And our feedback will tell us: if we put L at 3, and it's wrong, we expect that. So we don't learn anything? Actually, we wouldn't learn. So better to put L in a different position.

Also, ""POLIO"" has two O's? But that uses one new letter O? And repeats O? We don't know if O is in the word? So it might not be efficient? We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Therefore, ""BLIMP"" might be better: it introduces two new letters (B and M) and moves P, L, I to new positions?

Let me write the positions of ""BLIMP"":

Index: 1: B, 2: L, 3: I, 4: M, 5: P

Now, constraints from previous feedback:
- P was in position 2 and wrong -> so in secret, P is not at 2. Now we put P at 5: okay.
- L was in position 3 and wrong -> secret L not at 3. Now we put L at 2: okay (we are testing a new position).
- I was in position 4 and wrong -> secret I not at 4. Now we put I at 3: okay (testing a new position).

Also, we are testing B at 1 and M at 4, which are new.

So ""BLIMP"" is a good candidate.

But let me double-check: we have the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T. ""blimp"" contains B, L, I, M, P. None forbidden. And L, I, P are confirmed to be in the word? Well, the feedback from ""split"" says P, L, I are in the word. So including them is good.

So I'll guess ""BLIMP"".

But note: the word must be a valid English word. ""blimp"" is valid.

Alternatively, are there other words? For example, ""PILLY""? But L repeated? And we don't know if there are repeated letters? Also, Y is allowed? ""PILLY"" has two L's? And would push P to position 1? But wait: 
  P in 1, I in 2, L in 3 and 4? But we already know L cannot be in position 3? So if we put L in position 3, then the feedback might not be as informative? And we have position 3 L? Which we know is wrong? Also, we haven't tried Y? 

But I think ""BLIMP"" is better because it doesn't repeat letters and we get to test B and M.

Another word: ""GULPY""? G,U,L,P,Y. Has U? But missing I? Must have I.

""BLIPY"" not a word.

So I'll go with ""BLIMP"".

<guess>blimp</guess>The feedback indicates:
- Letters **P, L, I** are in the secret word but not at positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
- Letters **S, T, C, R, A, N, E** are NOT in the secret word.

For the next guess, I need a word containing **P, L, I** and avoiding forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E, S, T). The word must place P, L, I in positions that don't conflict with known constraints (e.g., P not at position 2, L not at position 3, I not at position 4).

I chose **""blimp""** because:
- Contains the required P, L, I and introduces two new common letters (B, M).
- Positions: B (new at 1), L (at 2; was previously position 3), I (at 3; was previously position 4), M (new at 4), P (at 5; was previously position 2).
- This avoids known incorrect positions: L is not at 3, I is not at 4, P is not at 2.
- Tests high-frequency letters B and M while adhering to known constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left. We can consider other vowels and consonants.
 Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)
 Consonants: We have many left, such as B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should try to cover as many common letters as possible. A good second guess might include letters like S, T, L, O, P, etc.

 Let me try to form a word without the forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E). Some options:

 Option 1: ""SPLIT"" - contains S, P, L, I, T. All these are not in the forbidden set.
 Option 2: ""MOUTH"" - M, O, U, T, H.
 Option 3: ""BUMPY"" - B, U, M, P, Y.

 However, we want to maximize the information we get. Since we have no correct letters, we should try to include frequent letters that we haven't tried.

 According to letter frequency in English, some of the most common letters (excluding the ones we've tried) are: S, T, L, O, P, I, etc.

 Let me choose a word that has as many of these as possible. ""SPLIT"" has S, P, L, I, T. That's five common letters.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" has P, I, O, U, S. But note that we haven't tried O, U, I, S, P.

 Another option: ""TOILS"" - T, O, I, L, S.

 But note: we must avoid E, A, R, N, C. All these words do avoid them.

 I think ""SPLIT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we haven't tried any of them.

 However, let me check if ""SPLIT"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.

 Alternatively, we could use ""SHIPT"" but that's not a word. Or ""SLIPT"" which is an archaic form of slipped? Better to stick with common words.

 Another common starting word that avoids these letters is ""MOIST"" (M, O, I, S, T). That also covers common letters.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels? We haven't tried O, U, I. ""MOIST"" has O and I.

 Let me compare:
   ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T -> we get information about S, P, L, I, T.
   ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> we get M, O, I, S, T.

 Both are good. I'll go with ""SPLIT"" for now.

 However, note that the feedback for the first word was all wrong, so the secret word has none of the letters in ""CRANE"". Therefore, we must avoid those.

 Let me confirm: the forbidden letters are C, R, A, N, E.

 So, I choose ""SPLIT"".

<guess>split</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), I need to choose a new word that avoids these letters entirely. My goal is to test other common letters to gather more information. 

I considered words like ""moist"" or ""pilot"", but I chose **""split""** because:
- It uses 5 new, high-frequency letters (S, P, L, I, T) not tried before.
- It avoids all forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E).
- It includes both vowels (I) and consonants to maximize coverage of likely letters.

<guess>split</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: split -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(-) L(-) I(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" – all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these.
2. ""split"" – S(x), P(-), L(-), I(-), T(x). This means:
   - S and T are not in the word at all (x).
   - P, L, I are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

Therefore, the secret word contains the letters P, L, I, but not S, T, and also not any of C, R, A, N, E from the first guess.

Additionally, the positions in ""split"" are:
  Position 1: S (wrong) – but we now know S is absent, so position 1 cannot be S.
  Position 2: P (wrong position) – so P is in the word but not in position 2.
  Position 3: L (wrong position) – L is in the word but not in position 3.
  Position 4: I (wrong position) – I is in the word but not in position 4.
  Position 5: T (wrong) – T is absent.

We also know that the word must contain exactly three letters from ""split"": P, L, I. The other two letters are unknown but must be from the remaining alphabet excluding:
  Forbidden: C, R, A, N, E, S, T (from the feedback of both guesses).

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains P, L, I (all three) and two other letters from the available set.
- P is not in position 2, L not in position 3, I not in position 4.
- Also, remember the positions: We have constraints on where P, L, I cannot be.

We should try to put P, L, I in different positions and include two new common letters to test more.

Possible approach:
- Since P, L, I must be in the word, we can try to form a word that rearranges P, L, I and adds two new letters. The new letters should be common to increase chances of getting more information.

Available common letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U.

Let me think of words that have P, L, I and two of these.

Possible words:
- ""PILOT"": But wait, we know I cannot be in position 4 (from feedback: I was in position 4 and was wrong position). Also, P cannot be in position 2? In ""split"", P was in position 2 and it was wrong. But note: in a new word, we can put P elsewhere. However, ""PILOT"" has P in position 1, I in position 2, L in position 3. But the feedback said L cannot be in position 3? Wait: the feedback only tells us that in the word ""split"", L was in position 3 and that was wrong. So in the secret word, L is not in position 3. Similarly, I is not in position 4. But that doesn't prevent L in position 3 in a future guess? Actually, the feedback for ""split"" says that L is in the word but not at position 3. Therefore, in the secret word, L is present but not in position 3. The same for P: present but not in position 2, and I: present but not in position 4.

So in a new guess, we can put L in position 1,2,4,5; I in position 1,2,3,5; P in position 1,3,4,5.

Now, checking ""PILOT"": 
  Position 1: P -> but in feedback, P was not at 2, but can be at 1? 
  However, we have forbidden S and T. Also, O is allowed? But ""PILOT"" has O and T, but T is forbidden? T was in ""split"" and marked as absent, so T cannot be in the word. Therefore, ""PILOT"" contains T, which is forbidden. So invalid.

Another word: ""OPIUM""? Let's see: O, P, I, U, M. 
  Letters: O, P, I, U, M. All are allowed? We haven't ruled out O, U, M. And no T or S or forbidden. But does it contain L? No. We need L because the feedback says L is in the word. So we must include L.

We must have P, L, I all.

So words that have P, L, I and two more from available.

Common words: 
  ""PLAID"" – but A is forbidden (from ""crane"" feedback, A is absent).
  ""PLUMB"" – B is allowed, U and M allowed? But: P,L,U,M,B. Contains L and P and U,M,B, but missing I? We need I too.

Actually, the word must contain P, L, and I. So we need a word with all three.

Let me search for words with P, L, I and two other letters from B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Examples:
  ""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> contains B,L,I,M,P. Note: B, M allowed. 
    Position: 
      1: B -> new
      2: L -> but in ""split"", L was in position 3 and wrong? Now we put L in position 2? Is that allowed? Yes, because the feedback only said position 3 was wrong, so L could be in 2.
    This word: BLIMP
    Positions: 1: B, 2: L, 3: I, 4: M, 5: P.
    Constraints:
      P cannot be in position 2? It was in position 2 and wrong. Now P is in position 5, which is allowed.
      L cannot be in position 3? Here it's in position 2, so okay.
      I cannot be in position 4? Here it's in position 3, so okay.
    Also, we avoid forbidden letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,T.

  ""GUILD"" – but has U,I,L,D, but missing P? And we need P.

  ""PLINK"": P, L, I, N, K – but N is forbidden? From ""crane"", N is absent so forbidden. Also, K is allowed.

Let's avoid N.

  ""BLIPS"": S is forbidden? From ""split"" feedback, S is absent. So S cannot be used.

  ""GLIMP"": not a word? 

  ""LIMPS"": again S forbidden.

  ""BUILD"" – B,U,I,L,D – no P.

  ""QUIPL"": not a word.

  ""PLIED"": P,L,I,E,D – but E is forbidden? E is in forbidden list from first guess.

  ""FLIPS"": S forbidden.

  ""CLIPS"": C and S forbidden.

  ""JUMPS"": has U,M,P,J,S? S forbidden.

Another idea: ""WHIMS"" – has W,H,I,M,S – S forbidden and no P,L.

Back to ""BLIMP"": it seems valid. It's a word (blimp is a type of airship). Letters B,L,I,M,P.

So let's consider ""BLIMP"". 

By guessing ""BLIMP"", we test:
  B (new), L (known but different position - was in 3, now in 2), I (known, was in 4, now in 3), M (new), P (known, was in 2, now in 5).

This would give us information about these positions and the letters B and M.

Alternatively, we might think of other words. What about ""MILKY""? But K and Y allowed? And we don't have P. Must have P.

Another word: ""OILED"" – but E and D? E forbidden.

What about ""DOILY""? D,O,I,L,Y – has I,L but no P. And missing P.

Another: ""POLIO""? P,O,L,I,O – has P,O,L,I,O. Letters: P, O, L, I. Two O's? That's allowed. But O is new? 
  Positions: 
    1: P -> P is not in position 2? Now in 1, okay.
    2: O
    3: L -> but feedback said L cannot be in position 3? In ""split"", L was in position 3 and it was wrong. So if we put L in position 3, it might again be wrong? But that's okay, we can test. Actually, the constraint is that in the secret word L is not in position 3. But in our guess, we are free to put L anywhere? However, if we put L in position 3 again and it's still wrong, we won't get new position info. Also, we know it's wrong because we know L is not in position 3 in the secret word? Actually, yes: we already know that position 3 is not L for the secret word. So it would be redundant to put L in position 3? And we might get a '-' meaning present but wrong position? But we already know it's not in position 3? So it would tell us nothing new? 

However, the feedback might tell us about the position but we already know it's not 3? So it might be a waste? 

We should avoid putting L in position 3 because we know it's not correct. Similarly, avoid P in 2 and I in 4.

In ""POLIO"": 
  Position 1: P -> okay (because P was in 2 and wrong, but we can try position 1? It's not forbidden for P to be at 1? The feedback only said position 2 was wrong for P, so 1 is unknown.
  Position 3: L -> we know that in the secret word, L is not at 3? And our feedback will tell us: if we put L at 3, and it's wrong, we expect that. So we don't learn anything? Actually, we wouldn't learn. So better to put L in a different position.

Also, ""POLIO"" has two O's? But that uses one new letter O? And repeats O? We don't know if O is in the word? So it might not be efficient? We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Therefore, ""BLIMP"" might be better: it introduces two new letters (B and M) and moves P, L, I to new positions?

Let me write the positions of ""BLIMP"":

Index: 1: B, 2: L, 3: I, 4: M, 5: P

Now, constraints from previous feedback:
- P was in position 2 and wrong -> so in secret, P is not at 2. Now we put P at 5: okay.
- L was in position 3 and wrong -> secret L not at 3. Now we put L at 2: okay (we are testing a new position).
- I was in position 4 and wrong -> secret I not at 4. Now we put I at 3: okay (testing a new position).

Also, we are testing B at 1 and M at 4, which are new.

So ""BLIMP"" is a good candidate.

But let me double-check: we have the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T. ""blimp"" contains B, L, I, M, P. None forbidden. And L, I, P are confirmed to be in the word? Well, the feedback from ""split"" says P, L, I are in the word. So including them is good.

So I'll guess ""BLIMP"".

But note: the word must be a valid English word. ""blimp"" is valid.

Alternatively, are there other words? For example, ""PILLY""? But L repeated? And we don't know if there are repeated letters? Also, Y is allowed? ""PILLY"" has two L's? And would push P to position 1? But wait: 
  P in 1, I in 2, L in 3 and 4? But we already know L cannot be in position 3? So if we put L in position 3, then the feedback might not be as informative? And we have position 3 L? Which we know is wrong? Also, we haven't tried Y? 

But I think ""BLIMP"" is better because it doesn't repeat letters and we get to test B and M.

Another word: ""GULPY""? G,U,L,P,Y. Has U? But missing I? Must have I.

""BLIPY"" not a word.

So I'll go with ""BLIMP"".

<guess>blimp</guess>The feedback indicates:
- Letters **P, L, I** are in the secret word but not at positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
- Letters **S, T, C, R, A, N, E** are NOT in the secret word.

For the next guess, I need a word containing **P, L, I** and avoiding forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E, S, T). The word must place P, L, I in positions that don't conflict with known constraints (e.g., P not at position 2, L not at position 3, I not at position 4).

I chose **""blimp""** because:
- Contains the required P, L, I and introduces two new common letters (B, M).
- Positions: B (new at 1), L (at 2; was previously position 3), I (at 3; was previously position 4), M (new at 4), P (at 5; was previously position 2).
- This avoids known incorrect positions: L is not at 3, I is not at 4, P is not at 2.
- Tests high-frequency letters B and M while adhering to known constraints.

This guess maximizes new information about the secret word's composition and structure.

We have the following feedback so far:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
Guess 2: ""split"" -> 
    S: absent (x)
    P: present, wrong position (-)
    L: present, wrong position (-)
    I: present, wrong position (-)
    T: absent (x)
So, the word contains P, L, I, but not S or T.

Guess 3: ""blimp"" ->
    B: absent (x)
    L: present, wrong position (-)  [so L is in the word but not at position 2? In ""blimp"", L was at position 2, and it's wrong position, meaning the secret word has L but not at position 2? But note: in ""split"", L was at position 3 and was wrong, so we already knew L is not at 3. Now we also know L is not at 2? Actually, the feedback for ""blimp"" tells us that L is in the word but not at position 2? But we already knew from ""split"" that L is in the word. The new information is that position 2 is also wrong for L? So L cannot be at position 2 or 3? Similarly, for I and P.

Let's break down ""blimp"" feedback:

- Position 1: B -> absent (x) -> so B is not in the word.
- Position 2: L -> present, wrong position (-) -> so L is in the word, but not at position 2. (We already knew it's not at 3 from ""split"", so now we know it's not at 2 or 3? But it could be at 1,4,5? However, we don't know the word length is 5, so positions 1 to 5.)
- Position 3: I -> present, wrong position (-) -> I is in the word, but not at position 3. (From ""split"", I was at position 4 and was wrong, so not at 4. Now we also know not at 3? So I cannot be at 3 or 4? It could be at 1,2,5? But note: in ""split"", I was at 4 and now at 3, both wrong. So I is not at 3 or 4? But we don't know about 1,2,5? Actually, we don't have information about position 1,2,5 for I? But we haven't tested I at 1 or 2 or 5? So we need to test those? However, we know I is in the word, just not at 3 or 4? So it must be at 1,2, or 5? Similarly for L: not at 2 or 3? So must be at 1,4, or 5? And for P: 
  In ""split"", P was at position 2 and was wrong? In ""blimp"", P was at position 5 and was wrong? So P is not at 2 or 5? And we don't know about 1,3,4? But wait, in ""blimp"" feedback: P at position 5 is present but wrong? So P is in the word but not at position 5? Similarly, from ""split"", not at 2? So P cannot be at 2 or 5? So it must be at 1,3, or 4? 

Also, from ""blimp"":
- Position 4: M -> present, wrong position (-) -> so M is in the word, but not at position 4? And we haven't tested M before? So M is a new letter that is in the word? 

And B is absent? So B is not in the word.

So to summarize:

Known present letters: P, L, I, M (from feedback: P and L and I from ""split"", and M from ""blimp"", and we know they are present? Actually, ""split"" told us P, L, I are present? And ""blimp"" told us M is present? And we also know that the word must have exactly these? Or could there be more? We don't know? But we have 5 letters? So the word has 5 distinct letters? Or could have duplicates? We don't know? But so far, we have 4 letters: P, L, I, M? And we need one more? Because the word is 5 letters? 

But wait: we have 4 known letters? And we need to find the fifth? 

Also, we know the following about the positions:

For L:
- Cannot be at position 2 (from ""blimp"") or 3 (from ""split"")? So L must be at 1,4, or 5.

For I:
- Cannot be at position 3 (from ""blimp"") or 4 (from ""split"")? So I must be at 1,2, or 5.

For P:
- Cannot be at position 2 (from ""split"") or 5 (from ""blimp"")? So P must be at 1,3, or 4.

For M:
- Cannot be at position 4 (from ""blimp"")? So M must be at 1,2,3, or 5.

And we have one more letter? Let's call it X? Which is one of the remaining letters that haven't been tested and are not forbidden.

Forbidden letters: from ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E; from ""split"": S, T; from ""blimp"": B. So forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,B.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word that has P, L, I, M, and one more letter from the available set? And satisfy the position constraints.

Also, the word must be 5 letters? And we have 5 distinct letters? Or could have duplicates? But we don't have any duplicates so far? So let's assume distinct for now? But we don't know? 

But note: we have 4 known letters? So we need one more? 

Now, we can try to arrange P, L, I, M and one new letter? And we have to avoid the forbidden positions.

Let me list possible positions for each:

L: positions 1,4,5
I: positions 1,2,5
P: positions 1,3,4
M: positions 1,2,3,5

We need to assign each to a distinct position? And add one more letter? 

But note: we have 4 letters and 5 positions? So one position will be the new letter? 

We need to choose a position for the new letter? And assign the known letters to the other positions without violating constraints.

Let me try to see possible placements:

Consider position 1: could be L, I, P, M, or the new letter? But if we put a new letter at 1, then we have to assign the others? 

Alternatively, we can try to put one of the known at 1? 

But let's think of words that have P, L, I, M and one more? 

Common words? 

For example, ""MILKY""? But K is available? But we don't have Y? And we need to check the positions? Also, ""MILKY"" has M,I,L,K,Y? But we don't have P? We must have P? So no.

""PLUMB""? But B is forbidden? And we don't have I? 

""PRIME""? But R is forbidden? 

""SLIME""? But S is forbidden? 

""GLIMP""? Not a word? 

""CLAMP""? C forbidden? 

""FLIMP""? Not a word? 

""JUMPY""? But J,U,M,P,Y? Missing L and I? 

We need a word with P,L,I,M? 

Another idea: ""IMPEL""? But E is forbidden? 

""PILOT""? T forbidden? 

""LIMPS""? S forbidden? 

""PLAID""? A forbidden? 

""BLIMP"" we already tried? 

Wait, we need a word that has P,L,I,M and one more? 

What about ""MILPA""? But A forbidden? 

""PLUM""? Only 4 letters? 

""PRIML""? Not a word? 

""IMPAL""? Not a word? 

""LIMP"" is 4 letters? 

""LAMPS""? S forbidden? 

""WIMPY""? W,I,M,P,Y? But missing L? 

""GULPY""? G,U,L,P,Y? Missing I? 

""QUIPL""? Not a word? 

""HELIP""? H,E,L,I,P? But E forbidden? 

""HELIX""? H,E,L,I,X? E forbidden? 

""OILMP""? Not a word? 

""MODEL""? But D,E,L? E forbidden? 

""DOLLY""? But no P,I,M? 

I think we need to look for words that have P,L,I,M? 

Another word: ""MILCH""? But C,H? C is forbidden? 

""FILMY""? F,I,L,M,Y? But missing P? 

""FILMP""? Not a word? 

""PIXEL""? P,I,X,E,L? E forbidden? 

""POLIO""? But O? And we have P,O,L,I,O? But we don't have M? And we need M? 

We must include M? Because from ""blimp"", M is present? 

So the word has M? 

What about ""MOLDY""? But D,Y? And O? But no P? And we have L? But missing P and I? 

We have to have P and I? 

Let me think: ""IMP"" is a root? 

""PRIMO""? P,R,I,M,O? R forbidden? 

""PRIME"" has R? 

""OPTIM""? O,P,T,I,M? T forbidden? 

""LIMBO""? L,I,M,B,O? B forbidden? 

""GIMPY""? G,I,M,P,Y? But missing L? 

""LINGO""? L,I,N,G,O? N forbidden? 

""VOMIT""? V,O,M,I,T? T forbidden? 

""PODIA""? P,O,D,I,A? A forbidden? 

""QUIET""? Q,U,I,E,T? E and T forbidden? 

""QUILT""? Q,U,I,L,T? T forbidden? 

""GUILD""? G,U,I,L,D? Missing P and M? 

""BUILD""? B forbidden? 

""JUMPS""? S forbidden? 

""DUMPY""? D,U,M,P,Y? Missing I and L? 

""HUMPH""? H,U,M,P,H? Missing I and L? 

""PLUSH""? S forbidden? 

""FLUID""? F,L,U,I,D? Missing P and M? 

""FLUMP""? F,L,U,M,P? But missing I? 

""FLIMP""? Not a word? 

""CLAMP""? C forbidden? 

""SLUMP""? S forbidden? 

""BLIMP"" we tried? 

Wait, but we have to include I? 

Another idea: ""IMPLY""? I,M,P,L,Y? That's I, M, P, L, Y? All required? And Y is available? 

Check: ""IMPLY"" has I, M, P, L, Y? Yes! 

Now, check the positions? 

In ""IMPLY"":
- Position 1: I
- Position 2: M
- Position 3: P
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: Y

Now, check against constraints:

For I: must be at 1,2, or 5? Here it's at 1 -> allowed? (since we haven't tested I at 1? and it's not forbidden? so we can try? But we know I is not at 3 or 4? 1 is new? so okay? 

For M: must not be at 4? Here M is at 2? which is allowed? and we haven't tested M at 2? so okay? 

For P: must be at 1,3, or 4? Here P is at 3? which is allowed? (not 2 or 5? so 3 is okay? 

For L: must be at 1,4, or 5? Here L is at 4? which is allowed? (not 2 or 3? so 4 is okay? 

And Y is new? 

Also, no forbidden letters? 

So ""IMPLY"" is a valid word? 

But let me confirm: is ""IMPLY"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

So we can guess ""IMPLY"".

But note: we have to make sure that the positions we are assigning are not known to be wrong? And they are not? 

We are testing I at 1, M at 2, P at 3, L at 4? 

We don't know if these positions are correct? But we are trying? 

Also, we are testing Y at 5? 

This seems a good guess? 

Alternatively, we could try ""LYMPH""? But H? And positions: L at 1, Y at 2, M at 3, P at 4, H at 5? 
- L at 1: allowed? 
- M at 3: allowed? (M can be at 3? 
- P at 4: allowed? (P can be at 4? 
- I is missing? But we need I? 

""LYMPH"" doesn't have I? So invalid? 

""PYGMY""? P,Y,G,M,Y? No L or I? 

So ""IMPLY"" seems the best? 

Another word: ""WIMPL""? W,I,M,P,L? But W and L? 
  Positions: W at 1, I at 2, M at 3, P at 4, L at 5? 
  I at 2: allowed? 
  M at 3: allowed? 
  P at 4: allowed? 
  L at 5: allowed? 
  But we haven't tried W? 

But ""WIMPL"" is not a common word? I'm not sure if it's valid? 

""IMPLY"" is better? 

So I'll go with ""IMPLY"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent → **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E.
- **Guess 2 (""split"")**: 
  - S and T are absent → **Excluded**: S, T.
  - P, L, I are present but in wrong positions → **Confirmed letters**: P, L, I (not at positions 2, 3, or 4, respectively).
- **Guess 3 (""blimp"")**:
  - B is absent → **Excluded**: B.
  - L, I, M, P are present but in wrong positions → **New confirmed letter**: M (not at position 4).  
  - **Updated position constraints**:
    - L: Cannot be at position 2 (from ""blimp"") or 3 (from ""split"") → Possible positions: 1, 4, 5.
    - I: Cannot be at position 3 (from ""blimp"") or 4 (from ""split"") → Possible positions: 1, 2, 5.
    - P: Cannot be at position 2 (from ""split"") or 5 (from ""blimp"") → Possible positions: 1, 3, 4.
    - M: Cannot be at position 4 (from ""blimp"") → Possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 5.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: P, L, I, M (all must appear, with one additional unknown letter).
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, B.
- **Remaining possible letters**: D, F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- The secret word has **5 distinct letters** (no duplicates inferred yet), so we need to find one additional letter from the remaining pool.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Must include P, L, I, M** and one new letter from the remaining pool (e.g., high-frequency letters like O, U, D, H, Y).
- **Position constraints must be satisfied** (e.g., L not at 2/3, I not at 3/4, P not at 2/5, M not at 4).
- **Goal**: Test new letter(s) while refining positions for known letters.

### Why ""IMPLY""?
- **Word**: ""IMPLY"" (valid 5-letter word).
- **Composition**: 
  - I, M, P, L, Y → Includes all confirmed letters (P, L, I, M) and tests Y (new high-frequency letter).
  - Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E, S, T, B).
- **Position Testing**:
  - I at position 1 → Allowed (possible positions: 1, 2, 5).
  - M at position 2 → Allowed (possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 5).
  - P at position 3 → Allowed (possible positions: 1, 3, 4).
  - L at position 4 → Allowed (possible positions: 1, 4, 5).
  - Y at position 5 → New letter test.
- **Information Gain**: Tests I at position 1 (untested), M at position 2 (untested), P at position 3 (untested), L at position 4 (untested), and Y as a potential new letter. This maximizes positional insights while adhering to constraints.

<guess>imply</guess>",imply,"We have the following feedback so far:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
Guess 2: ""split"" -> 
    S: absent (x)
    P: present, wrong position (-)
    L: present, wrong position (-)
    I: present, wrong position (-)
    T: absent (x)
So, the word contains P, L, I, but not S or T.

Guess 3: ""blimp"" ->
    B: absent (x)
    L: present, wrong position (-)  [so L is in the word but not at position 2? In ""blimp"", L was at position 2, and it's wrong position, meaning the secret word has L but not at position 2? But note: in ""split"", L was at position 3 and was wrong, so we already knew L is not at 3. Now we also know L is not at 2? Actually, the feedback for ""blimp"" tells us that L is in the word but not at position 2? But we already knew from ""split"" that L is in the word. The new information is that position 2 is also wrong for L? So L cannot be at position 2 or 3? Similarly, for I and P.

Let's break down ""blimp"" feedback:

- Position 1: B -> absent (x) -> so B is not in the word.
- Position 2: L -> present, wrong position (-) -> so L is in the word, but not at position 2. (We already knew it's not at 3 from ""split"", so now we know it's not at 2 or 3? But it could be at 1,4,5? However, we don't know the word length is 5, so positions 1 to 5.)
- Position 3: I -> present, wrong position (-) -> I is in the word, but not at position 3. (From ""split"", I was at position 4 and was wrong, so not at 4. Now we also know not at 3? So I cannot be at 3 or 4? It could be at 1,2,5? But note: in ""split"", I was at 4 and now at 3, both wrong. So I is not at 3 or 4? But we don't know about 1,2,5? Actually, we don't have information about position 1,2,5 for I? But we haven't tested I at 1 or 2 or 5? So we need to test those? However, we know I is in the word, just not at 3 or 4? So it must be at 1,2, or 5? Similarly for L: not at 2 or 3? So must be at 1,4, or 5? And for P: 
  In ""split"", P was at position 2 and was wrong? In ""blimp"", P was at position 5 and was wrong? So P is not at 2 or 5? And we don't know about 1,3,4? But wait, in ""blimp"" feedback: P at position 5 is present but wrong? So P is in the word but not at position 5? Similarly, from ""split"", not at 2? So P cannot be at 2 or 5? So it must be at 1,3, or 4? 

Also, from ""blimp"":
- Position 4: M -> present, wrong position (-) -> so M is in the word, but not at position 4? And we haven't tested M before? So M is a new letter that is in the word? 

And B is absent? So B is not in the word.

So to summarize:

Known present letters: P, L, I, M (from feedback: P and L and I from ""split"", and M from ""blimp"", and we know they are present? Actually, ""split"" told us P, L, I are present? And ""blimp"" told us M is present? And we also know that the word must have exactly these? Or could there be more? We don't know? But we have 5 letters? So the word has 5 distinct letters? Or could have duplicates? We don't know? But so far, we have 4 letters: P, L, I, M? And we need one more? Because the word is 5 letters? 

But wait: we have 4 known letters? And we need to find the fifth? 

Also, we know the following about the positions:

For L:
- Cannot be at position 2 (from ""blimp"") or 3 (from ""split"")? So L must be at 1,4, or 5.

For I:
- Cannot be at position 3 (from ""blimp"") or 4 (from ""split"")? So I must be at 1,2, or 5.

For P:
- Cannot be at position 2 (from ""split"") or 5 (from ""blimp"")? So P must be at 1,3, or 4.

For M:
- Cannot be at position 4 (from ""blimp"")? So M must be at 1,2,3, or 5.

And we have one more letter? Let's call it X? Which is one of the remaining letters that haven't been tested and are not forbidden.

Forbidden letters: from ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E; from ""split"": S, T; from ""blimp"": B. So forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,B.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word that has P, L, I, M, and one more letter from the available set? And satisfy the position constraints.

Also, the word must be 5 letters? And we have 5 distinct letters? Or could have duplicates? But we don't have any duplicates so far? So let's assume distinct for now? But we don't know? 

But note: we have 4 known letters? So we need one more? 

Now, we can try to arrange P, L, I, M and one new letter? And we have to avoid the forbidden positions.

Let me list possible positions for each:

L: positions 1,4,5
I: positions 1,2,5
P: positions 1,3,4
M: positions 1,2,3,5

We need to assign each to a distinct position? And add one more letter? 

But note: we have 4 letters and 5 positions? So one position will be the new letter? 

We need to choose a position for the new letter? And assign the known letters to the other positions without violating constraints.

Let me try to see possible placements:

Consider position 1: could be L, I, P, M, or the new letter? But if we put a new letter at 1, then we have to assign the others?

""POLIO""? But O? And we have P,O,L,I,O? But we don't have M? And we need M? 

We must include M? Because from ""blimp"", M is present? 

So the word has M? 

What about ""MOLDY""? But D,Y? And O? But no P? And we have L? But missing P and I? 

We have to have P and I?

Check: ""IMPLY"" has I, M, P, L, Y? Yes! 

Now, check the positions? 

In ""IMPLY"":
- Position 1: I
- Position 2: M
- Position 3: P
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: Y

Now, check against constraints:

For I: must be at 1,2, or 5? Here it's at 1 -> allowed? (since we haven't tested I at 1? and it's not forbidden? so we can try? But we know I is not at 3 or 4? 1 is new? so okay? 

For M: must not be at 4? Here M is at 2? which is allowed? and we haven't tested M at 2? so okay? 

For P: must be at 1,3, or 4? Here P is at 3? which is allowed? (not 2 or 5? so 3 is okay? 

For L: must be at 1,4, or 5? Here L is at 4? which is allowed? (not 2 or 3? so 4 is okay? 

And Y is new? 

Also, no forbidden letters? 

So ""IMPLY"" is a valid word? 

But let me confirm: is ""IMPLY"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

So we can guess ""IMPLY"".

But note: we have to make sure that the positions we are assigning are not known to be wrong? And they are not? 

We are testing I at 1, M at 2, P at 3, L at 4? 

We don't know if these positions are correct? But we are trying? 

Also, we are testing Y at 5? 

This seems a good guess? 

Alternatively, we could try ""LYMPH""? But H? And positions: L at 1, Y at 2, M at 3, P at 4, H at 5? 
- L at 1: allowed? 
- M at 3: allowed? (M can be at 3? 
- P at 4: allowed? (P can be at 4? 
- I is missing? But we need I? 

""LYMPH"" doesn't have I? So invalid? 

""PYGMY""? P,Y,G,M,Y? No L or I? 

So ""IMPLY"" seems the best? 

Another word: ""WIMPL""? W,I,M,P,L? But W and L? 
  Positions: W at 1, I at 2, M at 3, P at 4, L at 5? 
  I at 2: allowed? 
  M at 3: allowed? 
  P at 4: allowed? 
  L at 5: allowed? 
  But we haven't tried W? 

But ""WIMPL"" is not a common word? I'm not sure if it's valid? 

""IMPLY"" is better? 

So I'll go with ""IMPLY"".

<guess>imply</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent → **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E.
- **Guess 2 (""split"")**: 
  - S and T are absent → **Excluded**: S, T.
  - P, L, I are present but in wrong positions → **Confirmed letters**: P, L, I (not at positions 2, 3, or 4, respectively).
- **Guess 3 (""blimp"")**:
  - B is absent → **Excluded**: B.
  - L, I, M, P are present but in wrong positions → **New confirmed letter**: M (not at position 4).  
  - **Updated position constraints**:
    - L: Cannot be at position 2 (from ""blimp"") or 3 (from ""split"") → Possible positions: 1, 4, 5.
    - I: Cannot be at position 3 (from ""blimp"") or 4 (from ""split"") → Possible positions: 1, 2, 5.
    - P: Cannot be at position 2 (from ""split"") or 5 (from ""blimp"") → Possible positions: 1, 3, 4.
    - M: Cannot be at position 4 (from ""blimp"") → Possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 5.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: P, L, I, M (all must appear, with one additional unknown letter).
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, B.
- **Remaining possible letters**: D, F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- The secret word has **5 distinct letters** (no duplicates inferred yet), so we need to find one additional letter from the remaining pool.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Must include P, L, I, M** and one new letter from the remaining pool (e.g., high-frequency letters like O, U, D, H, Y).
- **Position constraints must be satisfied** (e.g., L not at 2/3, I not at 3/4, P not at 2/5, M not at 4).
- **Goal**: Test new letter(s) while refining positions for known letters.

### Why ""IMPLY""?
- **Word**: ""IMPLY"" (valid 5-letter word).
- **Composition**: 
  - I, M, P, L, Y → Includes all confirmed letters (P, L, I, M) and tests Y (new high-frequency letter).
  - Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E, S, T, B).
- **Position Testing**:
  - I at position 1 → Allowed (possible positions: 1, 2, 5).
  - M at position 2 → Allowed (possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 5).
  - P at position 3 → Allowed (possible positions: 1, 3, 4).
  - L at position 4 → Allowed (possible positions: 1, 4, 5).
  - Y at position 5 → New letter test.
- **Information Gain**: Tests I at position 1 (untested), M at position 2 (untested), P at position 3 (untested), L at position 4 (untested), and Y as a potential new letter. This maximizes positional insights while adhering to constraints.",Guess 4: imply -> FEEDBACK: I(✓) M(✓) P(✓) L(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
