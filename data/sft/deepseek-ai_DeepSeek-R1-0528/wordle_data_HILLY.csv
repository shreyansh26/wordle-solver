We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any feedback yet. 
 For the first guess, it's common to choose a word that has a good distribution of common letters to maximize information.
 Some commonly used starting words in similar games are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRAIN"", etc.

 Why choose a good starting word?
 - We want letters that are common in English words to maximize the chance that some of them are in the secret word.
 - Also, avoid repeating letters to cover more distinct letters.

 Let me pick a word that has vowels and common consonants.
 Example: ""STARE"" is a good candidate because it has 'S', 'T', 'A', 'R', 'E' — all very common letters.

 Another popular one is ""CRANE"".

 But note: the feedback we get will help us narrow down the next guesses.

 However, since there is no prior information, we can choose any of these.

 Let me choose: ""CRANE""

 Why ""CRANE""?
 - It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
 - All letters are distinct.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is also a strong starting word? But let's stick to one.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"".
</think>
I'm making my first guess without any prior feedback, so I'll choose a word with common letters and distinct characters to maximize information. ""CRANE"" is a strong opener because it contains frequently used letters like 'A', 'E', and 'R', while avoiding duplicates. This will provide useful clues about the secret word based on the feedback for positions and letter inclusions.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

This is quite surprising because these are common letters, but it gives us valuable information: the secret word does not contain any of the letters C, R, A, N, E.

Therefore, we must choose a new word that does not contain any of these letters.

We need to pick a word that uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting hits.

Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding C, R, A, N, E) might include: S, T, I, O, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

We should avoid using any of the letters that have been ruled out: C, R, A, N, E.

Let's think of a word that uses other common letters and has distinct letters to cover more ground.

Some good candidates might be:
- ""SLOTH"": uses S, L, O, T, H
- ""PIOUS"": uses P, I, O, U, S
- ""BUMPY"": but has duplicate? No, all distinct? B, U, M, P, Y -> distinct, but Y is less common.

Another popular starting word that avoids these letters: ""TULIP"" (T, U, L, I, P) or ""PILOT"" (P, I, L, O, T).

But note: we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let me list the available letters: we have 21 letters left (since 5 are excluded, but actually the alphabet has 26, so 21 left). However, we want to choose among the most common.

We can consider ""SLIPT"" but that's not a word? ""SPLIT"" is a word, but S, P, L, I, T.

""SPLIT"" is a valid word and uses common letters.

But we have to make sure we don't use any of the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E. ""SPLIT"" has S, P, L, I, T. None of the excluded, so that's good.

Another option: ""MOIST"" (M, O, I, S, T).

Or ""SHOUT"" (S, H, O, U, T).

We could also consider including a Y: ""STUDY"" (S, T, U, D, Y) but Y might be less common.

I think ""SPLIT"" is a good choice because it covers S, P, L, I, T, which are all common.

Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" is also good: P, I, O, U, S.

But note: we don't know if the word has vowels. We know that A and E are out, but the word must have vowels. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). So we should include at least one vowel.

In ""SPLIT"", we have I as a vowel. In ""PIOUS"", we have I, O, U.

I think ""PIOUS"" might be better because it has three vowels? But we are limited to 5 letters.

However, we are trying to get as much information as possible. Since we have no hits so far, we want to test a new set of letters.

I'll go with ""SPLIT"" because it is a common word and covers five new letters.

But let me confirm: S, P, L, I, T. None of C, R, A, N, E. So it's valid.

So my next guess is ""SPLIT"".

But note: the feedback might be all wrong again, but that would give us even more information.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses less common letters? But that might not be efficient. We should stick to common letters.

Another candidate: ""DOUGH"" (D, O, U, G, H) but G and H are less common? Or ""LIGHT"" (L, I, G, H, T) but G and H.

I think ""SPLIT"" is a solid choice.

So I'll guess ""SPLIT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (all letters marked as 'x'), we know that the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. Therefore, the new guess must avoid these letters entirely. 

To maximize information, the second guess should:
- Use common English letters not yet ruled out (e.g., S, T, I, O, L, P, U, M, D, etc.).
- Include distinct letters to cover more possibilities.
- Prioritize vowels still in play (I, O, U) since the word must contain at least one vowel.

A strong candidate is **""SPLIT""** because:
- It uses five new, common letters: S, P, L, I, T.
- It includes the vowel ""I"" and avoids the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E).
- If any letters match, the feedback will help narrow down the secret word significantly. If all are misses, it further eliminates five common letters.

But let\'s stick to one.\n\n I\'ll go with ""CRANE"".I\'m making my first guess without any prior feedback, so I\'ll choose a word with common letters and distinct characters to maximize information.

No, all distinct?

We know that A and E are out, but the word must have vowels. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). So we should include at least one vowel.\n\nIn ""SPLIT"", we have I as a vowel. In ""PIOUS"", we have I, O, U.\n\nI think ""PIOUS"" might be better because it has three vowels? But we are limited to 5 letters.\n\nHowever, we are trying to get as much information as possible. Since we have no hits so far, we want to test a new set of letters.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SPLIT"" because it is a common word and covers five new letters.\n\nBut let me confirm: S, P, L, I, T. None of C, R, A, N, E. So it\'s valid.\n\nSo my next guess is ""SPLIT"".\n\nBut note: the feedback might be all wrong again, but that would give us even more information.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that uses less common letters?

Therefore, the new guess must avoid these letters entirely. \n\nTo maximize information, the second guess should:\n- Use common English letters not yet ruled out (e.g., S, T, I, O, L, P, U, M, D, etc.).\n- Include distinct letters to cover more possibilities.\n- Prioritize vowels still in play (I, O, U) since the word must contain at least one vowel.\n\nA strong candidate is **""SPLIT""** because:\n- It uses five new, common letters: S, P, L, I, T.\n- It includes the vowel ""I"" and avoids the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E).\n- If any letters match, the feedback will help narrow down the secret word significantly.

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters are absent (x): so C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""split"" -> 
   - S: absent (x)
   - P: absent (x)
   - L: correct (✓) meaning L is in the word and in the correct position (which is the third position, since ""split"" is S-P-L-I-T, so L is the third letter).
   - I: present but wrong position (-) meaning I is in the word but not in the fourth position.
   - T: absent (x)

So, from the feedback:
- The word has the letter L in the third position (position 3).
- The word contains the letter I, but not in position 4.
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, T.

Also, note that the word must be 5 letters and we know the third letter is L.

Now, we need to think of a word that:
- Has L as the third letter.
- Contains the letter I, but not in the fourth position (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5).
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, E, S, P, T.

We also know that the word must be composed of letters from the remaining alphabet: 
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know I is included, but we have to place it).

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, T.

Now, we need to make a new guess that includes L in the third position and the letter I in a position that is not 4 (so 1,2, or 5) and also uses other letters from the remaining set to test.

We should also try to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.

Let's think of words that have L in the third position and include I.

Possible positions for I:
- Position 1: e.g., I _ L _ _
- Position 2: e.g., _ I L _ _
- Position 5: e.g., _ _ L _ I

We also need to avoid the excluded letters.

Let me list some candidate words:

Option 1: I in position 1.
- Words: I _ L _ _
  Examples: 
  - ""IGLOO"" -> but O is not excluded? O is still possible. But we have to check: I, G, L, O, O -> but O is repeated? Also, we don't know if O is in the word. Also, ""IGLOO"" has two O's, which might be acceptable if the word has two O's, but we don't know. However, we are trying to get information, so we might avoid duplicates to cover more letters? But if we use duplicate, we get less information. So ideally, we should use distinct letters if possible.

But note: we already know L is in the word and in position 3, so we don't need to test L again. But in the word, we have to put L in position 3.

We are required to have L in position 3, so we can't avoid it. But we can use it to form a valid word.

We should try to use a word that has I in one of the allowed positions and uses new letters.

Let me try to find words with pattern: 
- Position 1: I, then any letter (from available) then L (fixed) then two more.

But we have to avoid C,R,A,N,E,S,P,T.

Available consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z
Vowels: I (we know is in), O,U (and Y sometimes)

But we don't know about O and U.

Another idea: since I is present but not in position 4, and we have to place it in 1,2, or 5, we can try a word that puts I in position 1 and uses other common letters.

For example:
- ""IGLUS"" -> but S is excluded? S is in the excluded list (from split feedback: S is absent). So we cannot use S.

We cannot use S because it's excluded.

Similarly, P and T are excluded.

So available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But L is fixed in position 3, and I must be in the word but not in position 4.

Let me think of words with L in the third position and I in position 1:
- ""IDLY"" -> I D L Y. But that's 4 letters? We need 5. ""IDLY"" is 4 letters. 
  - 5-letter: ""IDEAL"" but A and E are excluded -> invalid.
  - ""IDLER"" but E and R excluded.

- ""IGLOO"": I G L O O -> uses G and O. O is not excluded. But it has two O's. We can use it? But we are not sure if O is in the word. Also, we are testing for O.

But note: we are allowed to have duplicate letters? The rules don't say the word has distinct letters. So it's possible.

But for guessing, we might prefer distinct letters to get more information. However, if we use a word with duplicate, we might get less information about other letters.

So let's avoid duplicates if possible.

Another word: ""JUMBO"" but no L? We need L in third.

We need L in third.

""JUMBO"" is J U M B O -> no L.

What about ""FJORD""? But R and D? R is excluded (from crane feedback: R absent). So R cannot be used.

Let's list words with pattern: I _ L _ _

Possible: 
- ""INPUT"" but P and T excluded, and U is available? ""INPUT"" has N (excluded) and P and T excluded -> invalid.
- ""IMPLY"" but M P L Y -> P is excluded -> invalid.
- ""INLAY"" but N and A excluded -> invalid.

It's hard to find a word with I in first and L in third without using excluded letters.

Try position 2: _ I L _ _

Examples:
- ""BUILT"" -> B U I L T -> but T is excluded -> invalid.
- ""GUILD"" -> G U I L D -> letters: G,U,I,L,D. None excluded? 
  - Check excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,T are excluded. G,U,I,L,D: G not excluded, U not, I is allowed, L is fixed, D not excluded. T is not in this word. So ""GUILD"" is a candidate.

But note: in ""GUILD"", I is in position 3? Let's see: 
Position: 1: G, 2: U, 3: I, 4: L, 5: D -> but we need L in position 3, not I. In ""GUILD"", L is in position 4, but we need L in position 3.

We need the word to have L in the third position. So in the pattern _ I L _ _, that would be: first letter any, second letter I, third letter L, then two more.

So ""GUILD"" has I in position 3 and L in position 4, which is not what we want.

We need: position 3 is L.

So pattern for position 2: _ I L _ _ -> meaning:
1: ?, 2: I, 3: L, 4: ?, 5: ?

So words like: 
- ""VILLA"" -> V I L L A -> but A is excluded, and also two L's? But A is excluded -> invalid.
- ""BILLY"" -> B I L L Y -> but Y is available? But two L's. And we don't know if Y is in the word. But A is not used? ""BILLY"" has B,I,L,L,Y. A is not in it. But we have to avoid A? A is excluded, so it's okay. However, we are using L twice, which is acceptable but we already know L is in the word. But we are testing other letters: B and Y.

But we also have I in position 2, which is allowed because the feedback said I is in the word but not in position 4, and position 2 is different.

But ""BILLY"" has two L's. The third letter is L, which is correct. The second letter is I, which is present but we don't know if it's in the right position until we get feedback.

But we are trying to test I in position 2? The feedback for ""split"" said I is present but not in position 4, so it could be in position 2.

However, we are also introducing B and Y.

But let's see if there are better words.

Another word: ""DILLY"" -> D I L L Y -> similar, with D and Y.

Or ""HILLY"" -> H I L L Y.

But again, two L's.

We can try without duplicates.

What about ""KILTS"" -> K I L T S -> but T and S are excluded -> invalid.

""GILTS"" -> G I L T S -> T and S excluded.

""WILCO"" -> W I L C O -> C is excluded -> invalid.

""JILKS"" -> J I L K S -> S excluded.

It seems difficult to find a word with I in position 2 and L in position 3 without using excluded letters.

Now, try position 5: _ _ L _ I

Pattern: first two letters any, third L, fourth any, fifth I.

Examples:
- ""FOLKI"" -> F O L K I -> letters: F,O,L,K,I. None excluded? F, O, K are not excluded? 
  - Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,T. So F,O,K are okay. 
  - But is ""FOLKI"" a word? I'm not sure. Let me check: folk is 4 letters, folkier is 6? ""FOLKI"" might not be a word.

Better: ""DOLLI"" -> not a word.

""HELIX"" -> H E L I X -> but E is excluded -> invalid.

""FELIX"" -> F E L I X -> E excluded.

""OILED"" -> O I L E D -> E excluded.

""VALID"" -> V A L I D -> A excluded.

""SOLID"" -> S O L I D -> S excluded.

""PULPI"" -> P U L P I -> P excluded and duplicate P.

""JUMBI"" -> J U M B I -> but no L? We need L in third.

We need L in third.

Another idea: ""MULCH"" -> M U L C H -> C excluded.

""BULKY"" -> B U L K Y -> letters: B,U,L,K,Y. None excluded? 
- B, U, L, K, Y. Excluded are C,R,A,N,E,S,P,T. So B,U,K,Y are not excluded. 
- But in this word, I is not present? We know I must be in the word, so we have to include I in the guess because we know it's in the word. Otherwise, we might not get information about other letters.

We must include I in the guess because we know it's in the word (from the feedback of ""split""). So we cannot make a guess without I.

Therefore, the guess must include I and L (with L in position 3).

So we have to have I in position 1,2, or 5.

Given the difficulty, let's consider using a word with I in position 1 and L in position 3, even if it has duplicate or less common letters.

For example: ""IGLUS"" is not valid because S is excluded and it's 5 letters? ""IGLUS"" is a word? Igloo is 5 letters? ""IGLOO"" is 5 letters, but we have two O's.

""IGLOO"": I G L O O -> positions: 1:I, 2:G, 3:L, 4:O, 5:O.

This uses I, G, L, O, O. We know L is in position 3, I is in position 1 (which is allowed because I is not in position 4). We are testing G and O.

But it has two O's, so if the secret word has only one O, we might get feedback that one O is present and the other absent? But the feedback might be confusing.

To avoid complexity, let's try to find a word without duplicates.

Another word: ""IDOLA"" -> I D O L A -> but A is excluded -> invalid.

""IDOLS"" -> I D O L S -> S excluded.

""IDLER"" -> I D L E R -> E and R excluded.

""OILED"" -> O I L E D -> E excluded.

Perhaps we can use a word with I in position 5.

For example: ""FUSIL"" -> F U S I L -> but S is excluded, and L is in position 5, but we need L in position 3. ""FUSIL"" has L in position 5, not 3.

We need L in position 3.

""FUSIL"" is F U S I L -> positions: 1:F, 2:U, 3:S, 4:I, 5:L -> not L in 3.

What about ""KOALA"" -> no L.

Let's search for words ending with I and L in third: _ _ L _ I

Examples:
- ""BALDI"" -> B A L D I -> A excluded.
- ""GOLDI"" -> G O L D I -> D and G, O. Is it a word? Not common.
- ""JOLKI"" -> not a word.

""YOLKI"" -> not a word.

""HELMI"" -> not a word.

Perhaps ""MOLDY"" -> M O L D Y -> but no I, and we must include I.

We must include I.

Another idea: ""MILKY"" -> M I L K Y -> positions: 1:M, 2:I, 3:L, 4:K, 5:Y.

This seems perfect! 
- L is in position 3, as required.
- I is in position 2, which is allowed (since it cannot be in position 4, and 2 is different).
- Letters: M, I, L, K, Y. None of these are in the excluded list (C,R,A,N,E,S,P,T).
- All letters are distinct.

So ""MILKY"" is a valid word and meets all criteria.

We can use ""MILKY"" as our next guess.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down further.

So I'll go with ""MILKY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so these are excluded.
- **Guess 2 (""split"")**: 
  - S(x), P(x), L(✓), I(-), T(x)
  - This means:
    - L is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 3.
    - I is in the secret word but not in position 4.
    - S, P, and T are absent and excluded.

### Key Constraints for the Next Guess:
- **Position 3 must be L** (from ""split"" feedback: L is correct).
- **I must be included** but **not in position 4** (it could be in position 1, 2, or 5).
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, T (cannot be used).
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and I must be included).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Prioritize including I in a new position (1, 2, or 5) to test its correct placement.
- Use distinct, common letters from the available set to maximize information.
- Avoid duplicates and excluded letters.

The word **""MILKY""** fits perfectly:
- **M** in position 1 (new letter).
- **I** in position 2 (tests I in a new position, allowed since it can't be in position 4).
- **L** in position 3 (required by feedback).
- **K** in position 4 (new letter).
- **Y** in position 5 (new letter).
- All letters are distinct and from the available set (no exclusions).

This guess tests I in position 2 and checks new common letters (M, K, Y), which will provide valuable feedback to narrow down possibilities.

<guess>milky</guess>",milky,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters are absent (x): so C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""split"" -> 
   - S: absent (x)
   - P: absent (x)
   - L: correct (✓) meaning L is in the word and in the correct position (which is the third position, since ""split"" is S-P-L-I-T, so L is the third letter).
   - I: present but wrong position (-) meaning I is in the word but not in the fourth position.
   - T: absent (x)

So, from the feedback:
- The word has the letter L in the third position (position 3).
- The word contains the letter I, but not in position 4.
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, T.

Also, note that the word must be 5 letters and we know the third letter is L.

Now, we need to think of a word that:
- Has L as the third letter.
- Contains the letter I, but not in the fourth position (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5).
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, E, S, P, T.

We also know that the word must be composed of letters from the remaining alphabet: 
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know I is included, but we have to place it).

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, T.

Now, we need to make a new guess that includes L in the third position and the letter I in a position that is not 4 (so 1,2, or 5) and also uses other letters from the remaining set to test.

We should also try to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.

Let's think of words that have L in the third position and include I.

Possible positions for I:
- Position 1: e.g., I _ L _ _
- Position 2: e.g., _ I L _ _
- Position 5: e.g., _ _ L _ I

We also need to avoid the excluded letters.

Let me list some candidate words:

Option 1: I in position 1.
- Words: I _ L _ _
  Examples: 
  - ""IGLOO"" -> but O is not excluded? O is still possible. But we have to check: I, G, L, O, O -> but O is repeated? Also, we don't know if O is in the word. Also, ""IGLOO"" has two O's, which might be acceptable if the word has two O's, but we don't know. However, we are trying to get information, so we might avoid duplicates to cover more letters? But if we use duplicate, we get less information. So ideally, we should use distinct letters if possible.

But note: we already know L is in the word and in position 3, so we don't need to test L again. But in the word, we have to put L in position 3.

We are required to have L in position 3, so we can't avoid it. But we can use it to form a valid word.

We should try to use a word that has I in one of the allowed positions and uses new letters.

Let me try to find words with pattern: 
- Position 1: I, then any letter (from available) then L (fixed) then two more.

But we have to avoid C,R,A,N,E,S,P,T.

Available consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z
Vowels: I (we know is in), O,U (and Y sometimes)

But we don't know about O and U.

Another idea: since I is present but not in position 4, and we have to place it in 1,2, or 5, we can try a word that puts I in position 1 and uses other common letters.

For example:
- ""IGLUS"" -> but S is excluded? S is in the excluded list (from split feedback: S is absent). So we cannot use S.

We cannot use S because it's excluded.

Similarly, P and T are excluded.

So available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But L is fixed in position 3, and I must be in the word but not in position 4.

Let me think of words with L in the third position and I in position 1:
- ""IDLY"" -> I D L Y. But that's 4 letters? We need 5. ""IDLY"" is 4 letters. 
  - 5-letter: ""IDEAL"" but A and E are excluded -> invalid.
  - ""IDLER"" but E and R excluded.

- ""IGLOO"": I G L O O -> uses G and O. O is not excluded. But it has two O's. We can use it? But we are not sure if O is in the word. Also, we are testing for O.

But note: we are allowed to have duplicate letters? The rules don't say the word has distinct letters. So it's possible.

But for guessing, we might prefer distinct letters to get more information. However, if we use a word with duplicate, we might get less information about other letters.

So let's avoid duplicates if possible.

Another word: ""JUMBO"" but no L? We need L in third.

We need L in third.

""JUMBO"" is J U M B O -> no L.

What about ""FJORD""? But R and D? R is excluded (from crane feedback: R absent). So R cannot be used.

Let's list words with pattern: I _ L _ _

Possible: 
- ""INPUT"" but P and T excluded, and U is available? ""INPUT"" has N (excluded) and P and T excluded -> invalid.
- ""IMPLY"" but M P L Y -> P is excluded -> invalid.
- ""INLAY"" but N and A excluded -> invalid.

It's hard to find a word with I in first and L in third without using excluded letters.

Try position 2: _ I L _ _

Examples:
- ""BUILT"" -> B U I L T -> but T is excluded -> invalid.
- ""GUILD"" -> G U I L D -> letters: G,U,I,L,D. None excluded? 
  - Check excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,T are excluded. G,U,I,L,D: G not excluded, U not, I is allowed, L is fixed, D not excluded. T is not in this word. So ""GUILD"" is a candidate.

But note: in ""GUILD"", I is in position 3? Let's see: 
Position: 1: G, 2: U, 3: I, 4: L, 5: D -> but we need L in position 3, not I. In ""GUILD"", L is in position 4, but we need L in position 3.

We need the word to have L in the third position. So in the pattern _ I L _ _, that would be: first letter any, second letter I, third letter L, then two more.

So ""GUILD"" has I in position 3 and L in position 4, which is not what we want.

We need: position 3 is L.

So pattern for position 2: _ I L _ _ -> meaning:
1: ?, 2: I, 3: L, 4: ?, 5: ?

So words like: 
- ""VILLA"" -> V I L L A -> but A is excluded, and also two L's? But A is excluded -> invalid.
- ""BILLY"" -> B I L L Y -> but Y is available? But two L's. And we don't know if Y is in the word. But A is not used? ""BILLY"" has B,I,L,L,Y. A is not in it. But we have to avoid A? A is excluded, so it's okay. However, we are using L twice, which is acceptable but we already know L is in the word. But we are testing other letters: B and Y.

But we also have I in position 2, which is allowed because the feedback said I is in the word but not in position 4, and position 2 is different.

But ""BILLY"" has two L's. The third letter is L, which is correct. The second letter is I, which is present but we don't know if it's in the right position until we get feedback.

But we are trying to test I in position 2? The feedback for ""split"" said I is present but not in position 4, so it could be in position 2.

However, we are also introducing B and Y.

But let's see if there are better words.

Another word: ""DILLY"" -> D I L L Y -> similar, with D and Y.

Or ""HILLY"" -> H I L L Y.

But again, two L's.

We can try without duplicates.

What about ""KILTS"" -> K I L T S -> but T and S are excluded -> invalid.

""GILTS"" -> G I L T S -> T and S excluded.

""WILCO"" -> W I L C O -> C is excluded -> invalid.

""JILKS"" -> J I L K S -> S excluded.

It seems difficult to find a word with I in position 2 and L in position 3 without using excluded letters.

Now, try position 5: _ _ L _ I

Pattern: first two letters any, third L, fourth any, fifth I.

Examples:
- ""FOLKI"" -> F O L K I -> letters: F,O,L,K,I. None excluded? F, O, K are not excluded? 
  - Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,T. So F,O,K are okay. 
  - But is ""FOLKI"" a word? I'm not sure. Let me check: folk is 4 letters, folkier is 6? ""FOLKI"" might not be a word.

Better: ""DOLLI"" -> not a word.

""HELIX"" -> H E L I X -> but E is excluded -> invalid.

""FELIX"" -> F E L I X -> E excluded.

""OILED"" -> O I L E D -> E excluded.

""VALID"" -> V A L I D -> A excluded.

""SOLID"" -> S O L I D -> S excluded.

""PULPI"" -> P U L P I -> P excluded and duplicate P.

""JUMBI"" -> J U M B I -> but no L? We need L in third.

We need L in third.

Another idea: ""MULCH"" -> M U L C H -> C excluded.

""BULKY"" -> B U L K Y -> letters: B,U,L,K,Y. None excluded? 
- B, U, L, K, Y. Excluded are C,R,A,N,E,S,P,T. So B,U,K,Y are not excluded. 
- But in this word, I is not present? We know I must be in the word, so we have to include I in the guess because we know it's in the word. Otherwise, we might not get information about other letters.

We must include I in the guess because we know it's in the word (from the feedback of ""split""). So we cannot make a guess without I.

Therefore, the guess must include I and L (with L in position 3).

So we have to have I in position 1,2, or 5.

Given the difficulty, let's consider using a word with I in position 1 and L in position 3, even if it has duplicate or less common letters.

For example: ""IGLUS"" is not valid because S is excluded and it's 5 letters? ""IGLUS"" is a word? Igloo is 5 letters? ""IGLOO"" is 5 letters, but we have two O's.

""IGLOO"": I G L O O -> positions: 1:I, 2:G, 3:L, 4:O, 5:O.

This uses I, G, L, O, O. We know L is in position 3, I is in position 1 (which is allowed because I is not in position 4). We are testing G and O.

But it has two O's, so if the secret word has only one O, we might get feedback that one O is present and the other absent? But the feedback might be confusing.

To avoid complexity, let's try to find a word without duplicates.

Another word: ""IDOLA"" -> I D O L A -> but A is excluded -> invalid.

""IDOLS"" -> I D O L S -> S excluded.

""IDLER"" -> I D L E R -> E and R excluded.

""OILED"" -> O I L E D -> E excluded.

Perhaps we can use a word with I in position 5.

For example: ""FUSIL"" -> F U S I L -> but S is excluded, and L is in position 5, but we need L in position 3. ""FUSIL"" has L in position 5, not 3.

We need L in position 3.

""FUSIL"" is F U S I L -> positions: 1:F, 2:U, 3:S, 4:I, 5:L -> not L in 3.

What about ""KOALA"" -> no L.

Let's search for words ending with I and L in third: _ _ L _ I

Examples:
- ""BALDI"" -> B A L D I -> A excluded.
- ""GOLDI"" -> G O L D I -> D and G, O. Is it a word? Not common.
- ""JOLKI"" -> not a word.

""YOLKI"" -> not a word.

""HELMI"" -> not a word.

Perhaps ""MOLDY"" -> M O L D Y -> but no I, and we must include I.

We must include I.

Another idea: ""MILKY"" -> M I L K Y -> positions: 1:M, 2:I, 3:L, 4:K, 5:Y.

This seems perfect! 
- L is in position 3, as required.
- I is in position 2, which is allowed (since it cannot be in position 4, and 2 is different).
- Letters: M, I, L, K, Y. None of these are in the excluded list (C,R,A,N,E,S,P,T).
- All letters are distinct.

So ""MILKY"" is a valid word and meets all criteria.

We can use ""MILKY"" as our next guess.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down further.

So I'll go with ""MILKY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so these are excluded.
- **Guess 2 (""split"")**: 
  - S(x), P(x), L(✓), I(-), T(x)
  - This means:
    - L is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 3.
    - I is in the secret word but not in position 4.
    - S, P, and T are absent and excluded.

### Key Constraints for the Next Guess:
- **Position 3 must be L** (from ""split"" feedback: L is correct).
- **I must be included** but **not in position 4** (it could be in position 1, 2, or 5).
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, T (cannot be used).
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and I must be included).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Prioritize including I in a new position (1, 2, or 5) to test its correct placement.
- Use distinct, common letters from the available set to maximize information.
- Avoid duplicates and excluded letters.

The word **""MILKY""** fits perfectly:
- **M** in position 1 (new letter).
- **I** in position 2 (tests I in a new position, allowed since it can't be in position 4).
- **L** in position 3 (required by feedback).
- **K** in position 4 (new letter).
- **Y** in position 5 (new letter).
- All letters are distinct and from the available set (no exclusions).

This guess tests I in position 2 and checks new common letters (M, K, Y), which will provide valuable feedback to narrow down possibilities.",Guess 3: milky -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(✓) L(✓) K(x) Y(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any feedback yet. 
 For the first guess, it's common to choose a word that has a good distribution of common letters to maximize information.
 Some commonly used starting words in similar games are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRAIN"", etc.

 Why choose a good starting word?
 - We want letters that are common in English words to maximize the chance that some of them are in the secret word.
 - Also, avoid repeating letters to cover more distinct letters.

 Let me pick a word that has vowels and common consonants.
 Example: ""STARE"" is a good candidate because it has 'S', 'T', 'A', 'R', 'E' — all very common letters.

 Another popular one is ""CRANE"".

 But note: the feedback we get will help us narrow down the next guesses.

 However, since there is no prior information, we can choose any of these.

 Let me choose: ""CRANE""

 Why ""CRANE""?
 - It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
 - All letters are distinct.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is also a strong starting word? But let's stick to one.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"".I'm making my first guess without any prior feedback, so I'll choose a word with common letters and distinct characters to maximize information. ""CRANE"" is a strong opener because it contains frequently used letters like 'A', 'E', and 'R', while avoiding duplicates. This will provide useful clues about the secret word based on the feedback for positions and letter inclusions.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

This is quite surprising because these are common letters, but it gives us valuable information: the secret word does not contain any of the letters C, R, A, N, E.

Therefore, we must choose a new word that does not contain any of these letters.

We need to pick a word that uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting hits.

Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding C, R, A, N, E) might include: S, T, I, O, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

We should avoid using any of the letters that have been ruled out: C, R, A, N, E.

Let's think of a word that uses other common letters and has distinct letters to cover more ground.

Some good candidates might be:
- ""SLOTH"": uses S, L, O, T, H
- ""PIOUS"": uses P, I, O, U, S
- ""BUMPY"": but has duplicate? No, all distinct? B, U, M, P, Y -> distinct, but Y is less common.

Another popular starting word that avoids these letters: ""TULIP"" (T, U, L, I, P) or ""PILOT"" (P, I, L, O, T).

But note: we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let me list the available letters: we have 21 letters left (since 5 are excluded, but actually the alphabet has 26, so 21 left). However, we want to choose among the most common.

We can consider ""SLIPT"" but that's not a word? ""SPLIT"" is a word, but S, P, L, I, T.

""SPLIT"" is a valid word and uses common letters.

But we have to make sure we don't use any of the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E. ""SPLIT"" has S, P, L, I, T. None of the excluded, so that's good.

Another option: ""MOIST"" (M, O, I, S, T).

Or ""SHOUT"" (S, H, O, U, T).

We could also consider including a Y: ""STUDY"" (S, T, U, D, Y) but Y might be less common.

I think ""SPLIT"" is a good choice because it covers S, P, L, I, T, which are all common.

Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" is also good: P, I, O, U, S.

But note: we don't know if the word has vowels. We know that A and E are out, but the word must have vowels. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). So we should include at least one vowel.

In ""SPLIT"", we have I as a vowel. In ""PIOUS"", we have I, O, U.

I think ""PIOUS"" might be better because it has three vowels? But we are limited to 5 letters.

However, we are trying to get as much information as possible. Since we have no hits so far, we want to test a new set of letters.

I'll go with ""SPLIT"" because it is a common word and covers five new letters.

But let me confirm: S, P, L, I, T. None of C, R, A, N, E. So it's valid.

So my next guess is ""SPLIT"".

But note: the feedback might be all wrong again, but that would give us even more information.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses less common letters? But that might not be efficient. We should stick to common letters.

Another candidate: ""DOUGH"" (D, O, U, G, H) but G and H are less common? Or ""LIGHT"" (L, I, G, H, T) but G and H.

I think ""SPLIT"" is a solid choice.

So I'll guess ""SPLIT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (all letters marked as 'x'), we know that the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. Therefore, the new guess must avoid these letters entirely. 

To maximize information, the second guess should:
- Use common English letters not yet ruled out (e.g., S, T, I, O, L, P, U, M, D, etc.).
- Include distinct letters to cover more possibilities.
- Prioritize vowels still in play (I, O, U) since the word must contain at least one vowel.

A strong candidate is **""SPLIT""** because:
- It uses five new, common letters: S, P, L, I, T.
- It includes the vowel ""I"" and avoids the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E).
- If any letters match, the feedback will help narrow down the secret word significantly. If all are misses, it further eliminates five common letters.

<guess>split</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: split -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) L(✓) I(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters are absent (x): so C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""split"" -> 
   - S: absent (x)
   - P: absent (x)
   - L: correct (✓) meaning L is in the word and in the correct position (which is the third position, since ""split"" is S-P-L-I-T, so L is the third letter).
   - I: present but wrong position (-) meaning I is in the word but not in the fourth position.
   - T: absent (x)

So, from the feedback:
- The word has the letter L in the third position (position 3).
- The word contains the letter I, but not in position 4.
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, T.

Also, note that the word must be 5 letters and we know the third letter is L.

Now, we need to think of a word that:
- Has L as the third letter.
- Contains the letter I, but not in the fourth position (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5).
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, E, S, P, T.

We also know that the word must be composed of letters from the remaining alphabet: 
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know I is included, but we have to place it).

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, T.

Now, we need to make a new guess that includes L in the third position and the letter I in a position that is not 4 (so 1,2, or 5) and also uses other letters from the remaining set to test.

We should also try to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.

Let's think of words that have L in the third position and include I.

Possible positions for I:
- Position 1: e.g., I _ L _ _
- Position 2: e.g., _ I L _ _
- Position 5: e.g., _ _ L _ I

We also need to avoid the excluded letters.

Let me list some candidate words:

Option 1: I in position 1.
- Words: I _ L _ _
  Examples: 
  - ""IGLOO"" -> but O is not excluded? O is still possible. But we have to check: I, G, L, O, O -> but O is repeated? Also, we don't know if O is in the word. Also, ""IGLOO"" has two O's, which might be acceptable if the word has two O's, but we don't know. However, we are trying to get information, so we might avoid duplicates to cover more letters? But if we use duplicate, we get less information. So ideally, we should use distinct letters if possible.

But note: we already know L is in the word and in position 3, so we don't need to test L again. But in the word, we have to put L in position 3.

We are required to have L in position 3, so we can't avoid it. But we can use it to form a valid word.

We should try to use a word that has I in one of the allowed positions and uses new letters.

Let me try to find words with pattern: 
- Position 1: I, then any letter (from available) then L (fixed) then two more.

But we have to avoid C,R,A,N,E,S,P,T.

Available consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z
Vowels: I (we know is in), O,U (and Y sometimes)

But we don't know about O and U.

Another idea: since I is present but not in position 4, and we have to place it in 1,2, or 5, we can try a word that puts I in position 1 and uses other common letters.

For example:
- ""IGLUS"" -> but S is excluded? S is in the excluded list (from split feedback: S is absent). So we cannot use S.

We cannot use S because it's excluded.

Similarly, P and T are excluded.

So available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But L is fixed in position 3, and I must be in the word but not in position 4.

Let me think of words with L in the third position and I in position 1:
- ""IDLY"" -> I D L Y. But that's 4 letters? We need 5. ""IDLY"" is 4 letters. 
  - 5-letter: ""IDEAL"" but A and E are excluded -> invalid.
  - ""IDLER"" but E and R excluded.

- ""IGLOO"": I G L O O -> uses G and O. O is not excluded. But it has two O's. We can use it? But we are not sure if O is in the word. Also, we are testing for O.

But note: we are allowed to have duplicate letters? The rules don't say the word has distinct letters. So it's possible.

But for guessing, we might prefer distinct letters to get more information. However, if we use a word with duplicate, we might get less information about other letters.

So let's avoid duplicates if possible.

Another word: ""JUMBO"" but no L? We need L in third.

We need L in third.

""JUMBO"" is J U M B O -> no L.

What about ""FJORD""? But R and D? R is excluded (from crane feedback: R absent). So R cannot be used.

Let's list words with pattern: I _ L _ _

Possible: 
- ""INPUT"" but P and T excluded, and U is available? ""INPUT"" has N (excluded) and P and T excluded -> invalid.
- ""IMPLY"" but M P L Y -> P is excluded -> invalid.
- ""INLAY"" but N and A excluded -> invalid.

It's hard to find a word with I in first and L in third without using excluded letters.

Try position 2: _ I L _ _

Examples:
- ""BUILT"" -> B U I L T -> but T is excluded -> invalid.
- ""GUILD"" -> G U I L D -> letters: G,U,I,L,D. None excluded? 
  - Check excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,T are excluded. G,U,I,L,D: G not excluded, U not, I is allowed, L is fixed, D not excluded. T is not in this word. So ""GUILD"" is a candidate.

But note: in ""GUILD"", I is in position 3? Let's see: 
Position: 1: G, 2: U, 3: I, 4: L, 5: D -> but we need L in position 3, not I. In ""GUILD"", L is in position 4, but we need L in position 3.

We need the word to have L in the third position. So in the pattern _ I L _ _, that would be: first letter any, second letter I, third letter L, then two more.

So ""GUILD"" has I in position 3 and L in position 4, which is not what we want.

We need: position 3 is L.

So pattern for position 2: _ I L _ _ -> meaning:
1: ?, 2: I, 3: L, 4: ?, 5: ?

So words like: 
- ""VILLA"" -> V I L L A -> but A is excluded, and also two L's? But A is excluded -> invalid.
- ""BILLY"" -> B I L L Y -> but Y is available? But two L's. And we don't know if Y is in the word. But A is not used? ""BILLY"" has B,I,L,L,Y. A is not in it. But we have to avoid A? A is excluded, so it's okay. However, we are using L twice, which is acceptable but we already know L is in the word. But we are testing other letters: B and Y.

But we also have I in position 2, which is allowed because the feedback said I is in the word but not in position 4, and position 2 is different.

But ""BILLY"" has two L's. The third letter is L, which is correct. The second letter is I, which is present but we don't know if it's in the right position until we get feedback.

But we are trying to test I in position 2? The feedback for ""split"" said I is present but not in position 4, so it could be in position 2.

However, we are also introducing B and Y.

But let's see if there are better words.

Another word: ""DILLY"" -> D I L L Y -> similar, with D and Y.

Or ""HILLY"" -> H I L L Y.

But again, two L's.

We can try without duplicates.

What about ""KILTS"" -> K I L T S -> but T and S are excluded -> invalid.

""GILTS"" -> G I L T S -> T and S excluded.

""WILCO"" -> W I L C O -> C is excluded -> invalid.

""JILKS"" -> J I L K S -> S excluded.

It seems difficult to find a word with I in position 2 and L in position 3 without using excluded letters.

Now, try position 5: _ _ L _ I

Pattern: first two letters any, third L, fourth any, fifth I.

Examples:
- ""FOLKI"" -> F O L K I -> letters: F,O,L,K,I. None excluded? F, O, K are not excluded? 
  - Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,T. So F,O,K are okay. 
  - But is ""FOLKI"" a word? I'm not sure. Let me check: folk is 4 letters, folkier is 6? ""FOLKI"" might not be a word.

Better: ""DOLLI"" -> not a word.

""HELIX"" -> H E L I X -> but E is excluded -> invalid.

""FELIX"" -> F E L I X -> E excluded.

""OILED"" -> O I L E D -> E excluded.

""VALID"" -> V A L I D -> A excluded.

""SOLID"" -> S O L I D -> S excluded.

""PULPI"" -> P U L P I -> P excluded and duplicate P.

""JUMBI"" -> J U M B I -> but no L? We need L in third.

We need L in third.

Another idea: ""MULCH"" -> M U L C H -> C excluded.

""BULKY"" -> B U L K Y -> letters: B,U,L,K,Y. None excluded? 
- B, U, L, K, Y. Excluded are C,R,A,N,E,S,P,T. So B,U,K,Y are not excluded. 
- But in this word, I is not present? We know I must be in the word, so we have to include I in the guess because we know it's in the word. Otherwise, we might not get information about other letters.

We must include I in the guess because we know it's in the word (from the feedback of ""split""). So we cannot make a guess without I.

Therefore, the guess must include I and L (with L in position 3).

So we have to have I in position 1,2, or 5.

Given the difficulty, let's consider using a word with I in position 1 and L in position 3, even if it has duplicate or less common letters.

For example: ""IGLUS"" is not valid because S is excluded and it's 5 letters? ""IGLUS"" is a word? Igloo is 5 letters? ""IGLOO"" is 5 letters, but we have two O's.

""IGLOO"": I G L O O -> positions: 1:I, 2:G, 3:L, 4:O, 5:O.

This uses I, G, L, O, O. We know L is in position 3, I is in position 1 (which is allowed because I is not in position 4). We are testing G and O.

But it has two O's, so if the secret word has only one O, we might get feedback that one O is present and the other absent? But the feedback might be confusing.

To avoid complexity, let's try to find a word without duplicates.

Another word: ""IDOLA"" -> I D O L A -> but A is excluded -> invalid.

""IDOLS"" -> I D O L S -> S excluded.

""IDLER"" -> I D L E R -> E and R excluded.

""OILED"" -> O I L E D -> E excluded.

Perhaps we can use a word with I in position 5.

For example: ""FUSIL"" -> F U S I L -> but S is excluded, and L is in position 5, but we need L in position 3. ""FUSIL"" has L in position 5, not 3.

We need L in position 3.

""FUSIL"" is F U S I L -> positions: 1:F, 2:U, 3:S, 4:I, 5:L -> not L in 3.

What about ""KOALA"" -> no L.

Let's search for words ending with I and L in third: _ _ L _ I

Examples:
- ""BALDI"" -> B A L D I -> A excluded.
- ""GOLDI"" -> G O L D I -> D and G, O. Is it a word? Not common.
- ""JOLKI"" -> not a word.

""YOLKI"" -> not a word.

""HELMI"" -> not a word.

Perhaps ""MOLDY"" -> M O L D Y -> but no I, and we must include I.

We must include I.

Another idea: ""MILKY"" -> M I L K Y -> positions: 1:M, 2:I, 3:L, 4:K, 5:Y.

This seems perfect! 
- L is in position 3, as required.
- I is in position 2, which is allowed (since it cannot be in position 4, and 2 is different).
- Letters: M, I, L, K, Y. None of these are in the excluded list (C,R,A,N,E,S,P,T).
- All letters are distinct.

So ""MILKY"" is a valid word and meets all criteria.

We can use ""MILKY"" as our next guess.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down further.

So I'll go with ""MILKY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so these are excluded.
- **Guess 2 (""split"")**: 
  - S(x), P(x), L(✓), I(-), T(x)
  - This means:
    - L is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 3.
    - I is in the secret word but not in position 4.
    - S, P, and T are absent and excluded.

### Key Constraints for the Next Guess:
- **Position 3 must be L** (from ""split"" feedback: L is correct).
- **I must be included** but **not in position 4** (it could be in position 1, 2, or 5).
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, T (cannot be used).
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and I must be included).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Prioritize including I in a new position (1, 2, or 5) to test its correct placement.
- Use distinct, common letters from the available set to maximize information.
- Avoid duplicates and excluded letters.

The word **""MILKY""** fits perfectly:
- **M** in position 1 (new letter).
- **I** in position 2 (tests I in a new position, allowed since it can't be in position 4).
- **L** in position 3 (required by feedback).
- **K** in position 4 (new letter).
- **Y** in position 5 (new letter).
- All letters are distinct and from the available set (no exclusions).

This guess tests I in position 2 and checks new common letters (M, K, Y), which will provide valuable feedback to narrow down possibilities.

No, all distinct? B, U, M, P, Y -> distinct, but Y is less common.\n\nAnother popular starting word that avoids these letters: ""TULIP"" (T, U, L, I, P) or ""PILOT"" (P, I, L, O, T).\n\nBut note: we want to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet me list the available letters: we have 21 letters left (since 5 are excluded, but actually the alphabet has 26, so 21 left). However, we want to choose among the most common.\n\nWe can consider ""SLIPT"" but that\'s not a word? ""SPLIT"" is a word, but S, P, L, I, T.\n\n""SPLIT"" is a valid word and uses common letters.\n\nBut we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E. ""SPLIT"" has S, P, L, I, T. None of the excluded, so that\'s good.\n\nAnother option: ""MOIST"" (M, O, I, S, T).\n\nOr ""SHOUT"" (S, H, O, U, T).\n\nWe could also consider including a Y: ""STUDY"" (S, T, U, D, Y) but Y might be less common.\n\nI think ""SPLIT"" is a good choice because it covers S, P, L, I, T, which are all common.\n\nAlternatively, ""PIOUS"" is also good: P, I, O, U, S.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has vowels. We know that A and E are out, but the word must have vowels. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). So we should include at least one vowel.\n\nIn ""SPLIT"", we have I as a vowel. In ""PIOUS"", we have I, O, U.\n\nI think ""PIOUS"" might be better because it has three vowels? But we are limited to 5 letters.\n\nHowever, we are trying to get as much information as possible. Since we have no hits so far, we want to test a new set of letters.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SPLIT"" because it is a common word and covers five new letters.\n\nBut let me confirm: S, P, L, I, T. None of C, R, A, N, E. So it\'s valid.\n\nSo my next guess is ""SPLIT"".\n\nBut note: the feedback might be all wrong again, but that would give us even more information.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that uses less common letters? But that might not be efficient. We should stick to common letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""DOUGH"" (D, O, U, G, H) but G and H are less common? Or ""LIGHT"" (L, I, G, H, T) but G and H.\n\nI think ""SPLIT"" is a solid choice.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""SPLIT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (all letters marked as \'x\'), we know that the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. Therefore, the new guess must avoid these letters entirely. \n\nTo maximize information, the second guess should:\n- Use common English letters not yet ruled out (e.g., S, T, I, O, L, P, U, M, D, etc.).\n- Include distinct letters to cover more possibilities.\n- Prioritize vowels still in play (I, O, U) since the word must contain at least one vowel.\n\nA strong candidate is **""SPLIT""** because:\n- It uses five new, common letters: S, P, L, I, T.\n- It includes the vowel ""I"" and avoids the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E).\n- If any letters match, the feedback will help narrow down the secret word significantly.

O is still possible. But we have to check: I, G, L, O, O -> but O is repeated? Also, we don\'t know if O is in the word. Also, ""IGLOO"" has two O\'s, which might be acceptable if the word has two O\'s, but we don\'t know. However, we are trying to get information, so we might avoid duplicates to cover more letters? But if we use duplicate, we get less information. So ideally, we should use distinct letters if possible.\n\nBut note: we already know L is in the word and in position 3, so we don\'t need to test L again. But in the word, we have to put L in position 3.\n\nWe are required to have L in position 3, so we can\'t avoid it. But we can use it to form a valid word.\n\nWe should try to use a word that has I in one of the allowed positions and uses new letters.\n\nLet me try to find words with pattern: \n- Position 1: I, then any letter (from available) then L (fixed) then two more.\n\nBut we have to avoid C,R,A,N,E,S,P,T.\n\nAvailable consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\nVowels: I (we know is in), O,U (and Y sometimes)\n\nBut we don\'t know about O and U.\n\nAnother idea: since I is present but not in position 4, and we have to place it in 1,2, or 5, we can try a word that puts I in position 1 and uses other common letters.\n\nFor example:\n- ""IGLUS"" -> but S is excluded? S is in the excluded list (from split feedback: S is absent). So we cannot use S.\n\nWe cannot use S because it\'s excluded.\n\nSimilarly, P and T are excluded.\n\nSo available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nBut L is fixed in position 3, and I must be in the word but not in position 4.\n\nLet me think of words with L in the third position and I in position 1:\n- ""IDLY"" -> I D L Y. But that\'s 4 letters? We need 5. ""IDLY"" is 4 letters. \n  - 5-letter: ""IDEAL"" but A and E are excluded -> invalid.\n  - ""IDLER"" but E and R excluded.\n\n- ""IGLOO"": I G L O O -> uses G and O. O is not excluded. But it has two O\'s. We can use it? But we are not sure if O is in the word. Also, we are testing for O.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to have duplicate letters? The rules don\'t say the word has distinct letters. So it\'s possible.\n\nBut for guessing, we might prefer distinct letters to get more information. However, if we use a word with duplicate, we might get less information about other letters.\n\nSo let\'s avoid duplicates if possible.\n\nAnother word: ""JUMBO"" but no L? We need L in third.\n\nWe need L in third.\n\n""JUMBO"" is J U M B O -> no L.\n\nWhat about ""FJORD""? But R and D? R is excluded (from crane feedback: R absent). So R cannot be used.\n\nLet\'s list words with pattern: I _ L _ _\n\nPossible: \n- ""INPUT"" but P and T excluded, and U is available? ""INPUT"" has N (excluded) and P and T excluded -> invalid.\n- ""IMPLY"" but M P L Y -> P is excluded -> invalid.\n- ""INLAY"" but N and A excluded -> invalid.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a word with I in first and L in third without using excluded letters.\n\nTry position 2: _ I L _ _\n\nExamples:\n- ""BUILT"" -> B U I L T -> but T is excluded -> invalid.\n- ""GUILD"" -> G U I L D -> letters: G,U,I,L,D. None excluded? \n  - Check excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,T are excluded. G,U,I,L,D: G not excluded, U not, I is allowed, L is fixed, D not excluded. T is not in this word. So ""GUILD"" is a candidate.\n\nBut note: in ""GUILD"", I is in position 3? Let\'s see: \nPosition: 1: G, 2: U, 3: I, 4: L, 5: D -> but we need L in position 3, not I. In ""GUILD"", L is in position 4, but we need L in position 3.\n\nWe need the word to have L in the third position. So in the pattern _ I L _ _, that would be: first letter any, second letter I, third letter L, then two more.\n\nSo ""GUILD"" has I in position 3 and L in position 4, which is not what we want.\n\nWe need: position 3 is L.\n\nSo pattern for position 2: _ I L _ _ -> meaning:\n1: ?, 2: I, 3: L, 4: ?, 5: ?\n\nSo words like: \n- ""VILLA"" -> V I L L A -> but A is excluded, and also two L\'s? But A is excluded -> invalid.\n- ""BILLY"" -> B I L L Y -> but Y is available? But two L\'s. And we don\'t know if Y is in the word. But A is not used? ""BILLY"" has B,I,L,L,Y. A is not in it. But we have to avoid A? A is excluded, so it\'s okay. However, we are using L twice, which is acceptable but we already know L is in the word. But we are testing other letters: B and Y.\n\nBut we also have I in position 2, which is allowed because the feedback said I is in the word but not in position 4, and position 2 is different.\n\nBut ""BILLY"" has two L\'s. The third letter is L, which is correct. The second letter is I, which is present but we don\'t know if it\'s in the right position until we get feedback.\n\nBut we are trying to test I in position 2? The feedback for ""split"" said I is present but not in position 4, so it could be in position 2.\n\nHowever, we are also introducing B and Y.\n\nBut let\'s see if there are better words.\n\nAnother word: ""DILLY"" -> D I L L Y -> similar, with D and Y.\n\nOr ""HILLY"" -> H I L L Y.\n\nBut again, two L\'s.\n\nWe can try without duplicates.\n\nWhat about ""KILTS"" -> K I L T S -> but T and S are excluded -> invalid.\n\n""GILTS"" -> G I L T S -> T and S excluded.\n\n""WILCO"" -> W I L C O -> C is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""JILKS"" -> J I L K S -> S excluded.\n\nIt seems difficult to find a word with I in position 2 and L in position 3 without using excluded letters.\n\nNow, try position 5: _ _ L _ I\n\nPattern: first two letters any, third L, fourth any, fifth I.\n\nExamples:\n- ""FOLKI"" -> F O L K I -> letters: F,O,L,K,I. None excluded? F, O, K are not excluded? \n  - Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,T. So F,O,K are okay. \n  - But is ""FOLKI"" a word? I\'m not sure. Let me check: folk is 4 letters, folkier is 6? ""FOLKI"" might not be a word.\n\nBetter: ""DOLLI"" -> not a word.\n\n""HELIX"" -> H E L I X -> but E is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""FELIX"" -> F E L I X -> E excluded.\n\n""OILED"" -> O I L E D -> E excluded.\n\n""VALID"" -> V A L I D -> A excluded.\n\n""SOLID"" -> S O L I D -> S excluded.\n\n""PULPI"" -> P U L P I -> P excluded and duplicate P.\n\n""JUMBI"" -> J U M B I -> but no L? We need L in third.\n\nWe need L in third.\n\nAnother idea: ""MULCH"" -> M U L C H -> C excluded.\n\n""BULKY"" -> B U L K Y -> letters: B,U,L,K,Y. None excluded? \n- B, U, L, K, Y. Excluded are C,R,A,N,E,S,P,T. So B,U,K,Y are not excluded. \n- But in this word, I is not present? We know I must be in the word, so we have to include I in the guess because we know it\'s in the word. Otherwise, we might not get information about other letters.\n\nWe must include I in the guess because we know it\'s in the word (from the feedback of ""split""). So we cannot make a guess without I.\n\nTherefore, the guess must include I and L (with L in position 3).\n\nSo we have to have I in position 1,2, or 5.\n\nGiven the difficulty, let\'s consider using a word with I in position 1 and L in position 3, even if it has duplicate or less common letters.\n\nFor example: ""IGLUS"" is not valid because S is excluded and it\'s 5 letters? ""IGLUS"" is a word? Igloo is 5 letters? ""IGLOO"" is 5 letters, but we have two O\'s.\n\n""IGLOO"": I G L O O -> positions: 1:I, 2:G, 3:L, 4:O, 5:O.\n\nThis uses I, G, L, O, O. We know L is in position 3, I is in position 1 (which is allowed because I is not in position 4). We are testing G and O.\n\nBut it has two O\'s, so if the secret word has only one O, we might get feedback that one O is present and the other absent? But the feedback might be confusing.\n\nTo avoid complexity, let\'s try to find a word without duplicates.\n\nAnother word: ""IDOLA"" -> I D O L A -> but A is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""IDOLS"" -> I D O L S -> S excluded.\n\n""IDLER"" -> I D L E R -> E and R excluded.\n\n""OILED"" -> O I L E D -> E excluded.\n\nPerhaps we can use a word with I in position 5.\n\nFor example: ""FUSIL"" -> F U S I L -> but S is excluded, and L is in position 5, but we need L in position 3. ""FUSIL"" has L in position 5, not 3.\n\nWe need L in position 3.\n\n""FUSIL"" is F U S I L -> positions: 1:F, 2:U, 3:S, 4:I, 5:L -> not L in 3.\n\nWhat about ""KOALA"" -> no L.\n\nLet\'s search for words ending with I and L in third: _ _ L _ I\n\nExamples:\n- ""BALDI"" -> B A L D I -> A excluded.\n- ""GOLDI"" -> G O L D I -> D and G, O. Is it a word? Not common.\n- ""JOLKI"" -> not a word.\n\n""YOLKI"" -> not a word.\n\n""HELMI"" -> not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""MOLDY"" -> M O L D Y -> but no I, and we must include I.\n\nWe must include I.\n\nAnother idea: ""MILKY"" -> M I L K Y -> positions: 1:M, 2:I, 3:L, 4:K, 5:Y.\n\nThis seems perfect! \n- L is in position 3, as required.\n- I is in position 2, which is allowed (since it cannot be in position 4, and 2 is different).\n- Letters: M, I, L, K, Y. None of these are in the excluded list (C,R,A,N,E,S,P,T).\n- All letters are distinct.\n\nSo ""MILKY"" is a valid word and meets all criteria.\n\nWe can use ""MILKY"" as our next guess.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down further.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""MILKY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so these are excluded.\n- **Guess 2 (""split"")**: \n  - S(x), P(x), L(✓), I(-), T(x)\n  - This means:\n    - L is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 3.\n    - I is in the secret word but not in position 4.\n    - S, P, and T are absent and excluded.\n\n### Key Constraints for the Next Guess:\n- **Position 3 must be L** (from ""split"" feedback: L is correct).\n- **I must be included** but **not in position 4** (it could be in position 1, 2, or 5).\n- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, T (cannot be used).\n- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and I must be included).\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Prioritize including I in a new position (1, 2, or 5) to test its correct placement.\n- Use distinct, common letters from the available set to maximize information.\n- Avoid duplicates and excluded letters.\n\nThe word **""MILKY""** fits perfectly:\n- **M** in position 1 (new letter).\n- **I** in position 2 (tests I in a new position, allowed since it can\'t be in position 4).\n- **L** in position 3 (required by feedback).\n- **K** in position 4 (new letter).\n- **Y** in position 5 (new letter).\n- All letters are distinct and from the available set (no exclusions).\n\nThis guess tests I in position 2 and checks new common letters (M, K, Y), which will provide valuable feedback to narrow down possibilities.\n\n<guess>milky</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: split -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) L(✓) I(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: milky -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(✓) L(✓) K(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:
1. ""crane"": all letters C,R,A,N,E are absent (x) → excluded.
2. ""split"": 
   - S(x), P(x), L(✓) [correct position 3], I(-) [present but wrong position, specifically not in position 4], T(x) → excluded S,P,T.
3. ""milky"":
   - M(x) → absent, so M is excluded.
   - I(✓) → correct position 2 (since ""milky"" is M-I-L-K-Y, position 2 is I).
   - L(✓) → correct position 3 (as before).
   - K(x) → absent, so K is excluded.
   - Y(✓) → correct position 5.

Current knowledge:
- Positions: 
  - Position 1: unknown, but we know it's not C,R,A,N,E,S,P,T,M,K (excluded).
  - Position 2: I (confirmed).
  - Position 3: L (confirmed).
  - Position 4: unknown, but I cannot be here (from guess 2 feedback) and we know K is excluded.
  - Position 5: Y (confirmed).
- Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,T,M,K.
- Required letter: I and Y are confirmed and placed, L is confirmed and placed.

So the secret word pattern is: [unknown] I L [unknown] Y, and the first and fourth letters must be from the remaining alphabet minus excluded letters.

Available letters: 
- Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,T,M,K → 10 letters.
- Total letters: 26, so 16 are available, but we have constraints.

Remaining letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Z (and we don't need I,L,Y because they are already placed and confirmed? But the word might have repeated letters? However, we have no indication of duplicates yet.)

But note: the feedback hasn't shown any duplicates, but it's possible. However, since we have I,L,Y placed and no feedback indicating duplicates, we'll assume for now that positions 1 and 4 are distinct and not I,L,Y (because if they were, for example, if position 1 were L, but L is already in position 3, it would have been marked as present elsewhere, but in ""milky"" we didn't get such feedback. Let's analyze:

In ""milky"": 
- Positions: 1:M (x), 2:I (✓), 3:L (✓), 4:K (x), 5:Y (✓).
- We didn't get any extra 'I' or 'Y' in other positions? So it's likely that the word has only one I, one L, one Y? Not necessarily, but since position 4 was K and absent, and positions 1 and 4 are unknown, we need to test.

But to play safe, we'll assume that positions 1 and 4 are not I,L,Y to avoid duplicates unless necessary, so use only the available letters.

Available letters for positions 1 and 4: B,D,F,G,H,J,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.

We also know from the first guess that the word doesn't have C,R,A,N,E, etc.

Now, the pattern: #1: letter from {B,D,F,G,H,J,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Z}, #2: I, #3: L, #4: letter from the same set, #5: Y.

We need to make a guess that fits this pattern and tests possible letters for positions 1 and 4.

Since we have two unknowns, we should choose a word that uses common letters and might be the solution.

Possible common words matching the pattern: I L Y at positions 2,3,5.

Examples of 5-letter words ending with 'Y', with 'I' in position 2 and 'L' in position 3:
- ""BILGY""? Not a common word.
- ""DILLY"": D I L L Y → but has double L. But we know L is in position 3, and this has L in position 4 too? Then position 4 would be L? But then in ""milky"", we had K in position 4 and it was absent, so if position 4 were L, it would have been marked as present, but we don't know if L is in the word multiple times? Let's see feedback for ""milky"": position 4 was K (x), but if the secret word had L in position 4, then in ""milky"", the L at position 3 was ✓, but the L at position 4 would not be in ""milky"", so it wouldn't be marked? So we can't tell if L is duplicated? Similarly, the I is fixed at position 2.

So ""DILLY"" is D-I-L-L-Y. Positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y. This satisfies: position 2:I, 3:L, 5:Y. But position 4 is also L. So it's possible? But we don't know.

Other words:
- ""FILMY"": F I L M Y → but M is excluded (from milky feedback: M absent). Invalid.
- ""GILPY""? Not a word.
- ""HILLY"": H I L L Y → double L. Again, possible? But H is available.
- ""JILSY""? J I L S Y → but S is excluded → invalid.
- ""OILSY""? O I L S Y → S excluded.
- ""PILSY""? P excluded.
- ""WILTY""? W I L T Y → T excluded.

So words with double L like ""DILLY"", ""HILLY"", ""BILLY"" might be candidates, but we have to check if we used excluded letters.

Available letters for pos1 and pos4: B,D,F,G,H,J,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.

For ""DILLY"": D and L (but L is at pos4 as well? L is duplicated). We cannot use L again? No, we can use it, but in our guess, we know L is at pos3, so in the guess, if we put L at pos4, it's a new guess.

But the problem: we don't know if the secret word has two L's. However, if we guess ""DILLY"", and if the secret word has only one L, then the feedback for position 4 might be (-) if the L is present elsewhere? But the L is in position 3 already, so if we put L in position 4, and the word has only one L in position 3, then position 4 L will be marked as absent? Or wrong position? Actually, if there is only one L, and it's correctly placed in position 3, then an extra L in position 4 will be marked as absent (x) because the L is already used in position 3.

Whereas if the word has two L's, then L in position 4 might be marked as correct (if in the right position) or present (-) if not in the right position.

So we can test it.

But to avoid confusion, perhaps we can try a word without duplicates first.

Another word: ""BIGLY"" = B I G L Y → positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:G (but we need L in position 3? This word has L in position 4? Not fitting.

We need L in position 3.

Another possibility: ""JIVY"" → too short.

What about ""GUILD""? G U I L D → but L is in position 4? Not 3.

We need fixed pattern: _ I L _ Y.

So words ending with Y, with I in position 2 and L in position 3.

Common words: 
- ""SILLY"" → S excluded.
- ""FILLY"" → F I L L Y → double L. F is available.
- ""WILLY"" → W I L L Y → double L. W available.

Also: ""JILLY""? J I L L Y → double L.

Non-double-L words? 
- ""OILY"" → too short?
- 5-letter words: ""OLLIE""? But that's O L L I E → pattern O-L-L-I-E → not fitting our pattern.

Another one: ""VOILA"" → V O I L A → A excluded.

""BOGIE"" → B O G I E → E excluded and no L.

""LOGIN"" → L O G I N → N excluded and L is at position 1.

But we need L at position 3.

So hard to find words without double L? Perhaps ""UTILE"" but E excluded and Y required? We need Y at the end.

So let's accept that, and choose a word like ""HILLY"" or ""FILLY"".

""HILLY"": H I L L Y → positions: 1:H, 2:I, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y.

This uses H and L at position 4 again. But we are testing H and the possibility of double L.

Similarly, ""FILLY"" uses F.

Both H and F are available.

We can pick one. Which is more common? ""HILLY"" might be more common.

But let's see if there's a word without double L.

Another word: ""DOILY"" → D O I L Y → pattern: 1:D, 2:O, 3:I, 4:L, 5:Y → but wait, position 3 is I, not L! We need position 3 to be L, but in this word position 4 is L? So incorrect pattern.

But we need position 3 to be L.

""DOILY"" has I in position 3 and L in position 4? That doesn't match.

Another idea: ""DIZZY"" but no L.

Perhaps ""FILMY"" but M excluded.

It seems inevitable to have a word with double L or accept less common words.

What about ""OILED""? But E excluded.

""QUID"" not 5 letters.

""BUILD"" but no Y.

We must have Y at position 5.

An obscure word: ""XYLYL"" but X,Y,L duplicated and not matching pattern.

Given the constraints, let's go with ""HILLY"" or ""FILLY"". Both are valid words.

We can choose ""HILLY"" to use H.

But note the available letters: If we guess ""HILLY"", we test H at position 1 and implicitly test if L is duplicated at position 4.

If the feedback for position 4 L is:
- If ✓ then L is in position 4 and we solved? But we don't know yet.
- If (-) then L is in the word but position 4 is wrong? But L is already at position 3, so if duplicate L exists, it could be elsewhere? But positions 1 and 5 are H and Y, so unless L is in position 1, but position 1 is H, so it can't be L? Wait.

In ""HILLY"": 
Positions: 1:H, 2:I, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y.

The secret word must have I in pos2, L in pos3, Y in pos5. So the only unknown is position 1 and 4.

If we place L at position 4, and if secret word has L at position 4, it will be ✓; if it doesn't, but has duplicate L, it might be (-) if L is elsewhere? But the only other position is position 1? But position 1 has H in our guess.

So if the secret word has L only at position 3, then L at position 4 in ""HILLY"" will be marked as absent (x) because the single L is already used in position 3 (correctly).

Whereas if secret word has L at position 4 as well (so two L's), then L at position 4 will be marked ✓.

So we can distinguish.

But our goal is to guess the word, so if we guess a possible solution, it's fine.

Another candidate word without double L: ""BIFFY""? Not a word.

""DOGHY""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""DWILY""? Not common.

Another common word: ""VIXEN"" but E and no L.

I think ""HILLY"" is a good guess.

But let's check ""BILLY"": B I L L Y → B available.

Similarly ""DILLY"": D available.

We can choose ""BILLY"".

Or to use a less common letter, but we want information.

Since position 4 is unknown and we need to test a new letter, but if we use L at position 4, we are not testing a new letter. So if we use a new letter, we can get more information.

Therefore, we should prefer a word that has a non-L letter at position 4 to test a new letter.

For example, if we can find a word with pattern _ I L X Y, where X is a new letter.

Such as ""DIGLY""? Not a word.

""BIGLY"" → B I G L Y → pattern: 1:B, 2:I, 3:G, 4:L, 5:Y → so position 3 is G, not L! Invalid for our pattern.

We need position 3 to be L.

Is there a word like ""V I L D Y""? ""Vildy"" not a word.

""W I L O Y"" not a word.

""J I L B Y"" → ""JILBY""? Not a word.

""F I L C H"" but C excluded.

Perhaps ""OIL"" words? ""OILY"" too short.

I think it's not easy, so we might have to go with a double L word or use a less common word.

Another possibility: ""GUILY"" → not a word? Guilty is 6.

""QUILL"" → Q U I L L → but that ends with L, not Y. And positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:L, 5:L → not matching pattern.

But we need Y at position 5.

Let's search for standard words: I recall ""GIDDY"", but no L.

""LILY"" too short.

Perhaps ""UKASE"" but no L or Y.

Given the requirements, there are words like ""DILLY"", ""HILLY"", ""BILLY"", ""FILLY"", ""JILLY"", ""WILLY"", etc.

Let's pick ""WILLY"" (will-y) which is willy? Like Willie is shortened? But ""willy"" is a valid word meaning, for example, a willow basket or informal for willpower.

""WILLY"": W-I-L-L-Y → positions: 1:W, 2:I, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y.

This uses W, which is less common? But available.

Alternatively, we can use ""DOILY"" but it doesn't have L in position 3.

Perhaps ""DAILY"" but A excluded.

So I think ""HILLY"" is fine.

But to test a new letter at position 4, we must avoid L there.

Let's list possible solutions: what 5-letter words end with Y, have I in position 2, L in position 3.

Common ones: ""SILLY"" excluded S.

""FILLY"" is one. ""HILLY"" is another. ""BILLY"". ""DILLY"". ""WILLY"". That's it.

Also ""VILLY"" (not common) or ""ZILLY"" (silly), but Z is available.

""ZILLY"": Z-I-L-L-Y.

Now, other obscure words like ""XYLOL"" but not Y ending and no I.

So we have several options: all with double L.

Since the pattern is rare, and we have to choose from these, we can guess one of them.

But we also have position 1: which can be B,D,F,G,H,J, etc.

We don't have information on position 1.

So to get the most information, since position 4 is L in all candidate solution words, if we guess a word with a non-L at position 4, we rule out the possibility of L at position 4.

But if we guess a candidate solution, we may win or get feedback.

But we have only 6 tries, and this is guess 4, so let's try to guess a word that covers new letters.

For example, if we guess ""WILLY"", we test W and double L.

Similarly, ""BILLY"" tests B.

So let's choose one with a common letter? Or less common?

Since H was available, ""HILLY"" is a good choice.

But let's see the feedback of ""milky"" : we had Y at position 5 correct, so the word ends with Y.

We need to make a guess.

Let's choose ""HILLY"".

Or ""FILLY"" might be better? F is less common.

We have letter distribution, but not sure.

We can also guess a word that keeps L at position 3, I at 2, Y at 5, and uses different letters for positions 1 and 4, even if it's not a valid word? No, must be valid.

Another approach: guess a word that has only one L, with a different letter at position 4.

e.g., ""B I L D Y"" — ""Bildy"" not a word.

""G I L O Y"" — ""GILOY""? Not common, but ""giloy"" is plant, sometimes accepted? Might not be.

In words, ""galaxy"" but has A, excluded.

Perhaps ""JULEP"" but no Y.

I think we have to go with the double L words.

Let's pick ""FILLY"" which I think is a valid word (a young horse).

So I'll go with ""FILLY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E (from ""crane""), S, P, T (from ""split""), M, K (from ""milky"").
- **Confirmed positions**: 
  - Position 2: I (from ""milky"" feedback: I is correct).
  - Position 3: L (from ""split"" and ""milky"" feedback).
  - Position 5: Y (from ""milky"" feedback: Y is correct).
- **Pattern**: The secret word must follow the pattern `[unknown] I L [unknown] Y`, where:
  - Position 1 must be a letter not excluded (available: B, D, F, G, H, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).
  - Position 4 must be a letter not excluded (same available set), and cannot be I (since I is confirmed at position 2), L (from feedback rules), or Y (position 5).
- **Additional constraint**: From ""split"" feedback (I is present but wrong position), position 4 cannot be I (already satisfied by the pattern), and no feedback indicates duplicates, so the secret word may or may not have repeated letters.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- The secret word must end with Y (position 5) and have ""IL"" in positions 2–3.
- Common words fitting this pattern with the available letters include ""HILLY"", ""FILLY"", ""BILLY"", ""DILLY"", and ""WILLY""—all have double L (position 4 is L).
- Choose a candidate that tests position 1 with a common letter while respecting exclusions. ""HILLY"" is a valid word that tests ""H"" in position 1 and the potential for double L in position 4.
- Feedback will confirm if:
  - Position 1 is H (if ✓), or provide new information if absent.
  - Position 4 is L (if ✓ or - due to duplicate L), helping narrow down the solution.

Guess: **""HILLY""**

<guess>hilly</guess>",hilly,"We have feedback from three guesses:
1. ""crane"": all letters C,R,A,N,E are absent (x) → excluded.
2. ""split"": 
   - S(x), P(x), L(✓) [correct position 3], I(-) [present but wrong position, specifically not in position 4], T(x) → excluded S,P,T.
3. ""milky"":
   - M(x) → absent, so M is excluded.
   - I(✓) → correct position 2 (since ""milky"" is M-I-L-K-Y, position 2 is I).
   - L(✓) → correct position 3 (as before).
   - K(x) → absent, so K is excluded.
   - Y(✓) → correct position 5.

Current knowledge:
- Positions: 
  - Position 1: unknown, but we know it's not C,R,A,N,E,S,P,T,M,K (excluded).
  - Position 2: I (confirmed).
  - Position 3: L (confirmed).
  - Position 4: unknown, but I cannot be here (from guess 2 feedback) and we know K is excluded.
  - Position 5: Y (confirmed).
- Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,T,M,K.
- Required letter: I and Y are confirmed and placed, L is confirmed and placed.

So the secret word pattern is: [unknown] I L [unknown] Y, and the first and fourth letters must be from the remaining alphabet minus excluded letters.

Available letters: 
- Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,T,M,K → 10 letters.
- Total letters: 26, so 16 are available, but we have constraints.

Remaining letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Z (and we don't need I,L,Y because they are already placed and confirmed? But the word might have repeated letters? However, we have no indication of duplicates yet.)

But note: the feedback hasn't shown any duplicates, but it's possible. However, since we have I,L,Y placed and no feedback indicating duplicates, we'll assume for now that positions 1 and 4 are distinct and not I,L,Y (because if they were, for example, if position 1 were L, but L is already in position 3, it would have been marked as present elsewhere, but in ""milky"" we didn't get such feedback. Let's analyze:

In ""milky"": 
- Positions: 1:M (x), 2:I (✓), 3:L (✓), 4:K (x), 5:Y (✓).
- We didn't get any extra 'I' or 'Y' in other positions? So it's likely that the word has only one I, one L, one Y? Not necessarily, but since position 4 was K and absent, and positions 1 and 4 are unknown, we need to test.

But to play safe, we'll assume that positions 1 and 4 are not I,L,Y to avoid duplicates unless necessary, so use only the available letters.

Available letters for positions 1 and 4: B,D,F,G,H,J,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.

We also know from the first guess that the word doesn't have C,R,A,N,E, etc.

Now, the pattern: #1: letter from {B,D,F,G,H,J,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Z}, #2: I, #3: L, #4: letter from the same set, #5: Y.

We need to make a guess that fits this pattern and tests possible letters for positions 1 and 4.

Since we have two unknowns, we should choose a word that uses common letters and might be the solution.

Possible common words matching the pattern: I L Y at positions 2,3,5.

Examples of 5-letter words ending with 'Y', with 'I' in position 2 and 'L' in position 3:
- ""BILGY""? Not a common word.
- ""DILLY"": D I L L Y → but has double L. But we know L is in position 3, and this has L in position 4 too? Then position 4 would be L? But then in ""milky"", we had K in position 4 and it was absent, so if position 4 were L, it would have been marked as present, but we don't know if L is in the word multiple times? Let's see feedback for ""milky"": position 4 was K (x), but if the secret word had L in position 4, then in ""milky"", the L at position 3 was ✓, but the L at position 4 would not be in ""milky"", so it wouldn't be marked? So we can't tell if L is duplicated? Similarly, the I is fixed at position 2.

So ""DILLY"" is D-I-L-L-Y. Positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y. This satisfies: position 2:I, 3:L, 5:Y. But position 4 is also L. So it's possible? But we don't know.

Other words:
- ""FILMY"": F I L M Y → but M is excluded (from milky feedback: M absent). Invalid.
- ""GILPY""? Not a word.
- ""HILLY"": H I L L Y → double L. Again, possible? But H is available.
- ""JILSY""? J I L S Y → but S is excluded → invalid.
- ""OILSY""? O I L S Y → S excluded.
- ""PILSY""? P excluded.
- ""WILTY""? W I L T Y → T excluded.

So words with double L like ""DILLY"", ""HILLY"", ""BILLY"" might be candidates, but we have to check if we used excluded letters.

Available letters for pos1 and pos4: B,D,F,G,H,J,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.

For ""DILLY"": D and L (but L is at pos4 as well? L is duplicated). We cannot use L again? No, we can use it, but in our guess, we know L is at pos3, so in the guess, if we put L at pos4, it's a new guess.

But the problem: we don't know if the secret word has two L's. However, if we guess ""DILLY"", and if the secret word has only one L, then the feedback for position 4 might be (-) if the L is present elsewhere? But the L is in position 3 already, so if we put L in position 4, and the word has only one L in position 3, then position 4 L will be marked as absent? Or wrong position? Actually, if there is only one L, and it's correctly placed in position 3, then an extra L in position 4 will be marked as absent (x) because the L is already used in position 3.

Whereas if the word has two L's, then L in position 4 might be marked as correct (if in the right position) or present (-) if not in the right position.

So we can test it.

But to avoid confusion, perhaps we can try a word without duplicates first.

Another word: ""BIGLY"" = B I G L Y → positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:G (but we need L in position 3? This word has L in position 4? Not fitting.

We need L in position 3.

Another possibility: ""JIVY"" → too short.

What about ""GUILD""? G U I L D → but L is in position 4? Not 3.

We need fixed pattern: _ I L _ Y.

So words ending with Y, with I in position 2 and L in position 3.

Common words: 
- ""SILLY"" → S excluded.
- ""FILLY"" → F I L L Y → double L. F is available.
- ""WILLY"" → W I L L Y → double L. W available.

Also: ""JILLY""? J I L L Y → double L.

Non-double-L words? 
- ""OILY"" → too short?
- 5-letter words: ""OLLIE""? But that's O L L I E → pattern O-L-L-I-E → not fitting our pattern.

Another one: ""VOILA"" → V O I L A → A excluded.

""BOGIE"" → B O G I E → E excluded and no L.

""LOGIN"" → L O G I N → N excluded and L is at position 1.

But we need L at position 3.

So hard to find words without double L? Perhaps ""UTILE"" but E excluded and Y required? We need Y at the end.

So let's accept that, and choose a word like ""HILLY"" or ""FILLY"".

""HILLY"": H I L L Y → positions: 1:H, 2:I, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y.

This uses H and L at position 4 again. But we are testing H and the possibility of double L.

Similarly, ""FILLY"" uses F.

Both H and F are available.

We can pick one. Which is more common? ""HILLY"" might be more common.

But let's see if there's a word without double L.

Another word: ""DOILY"" → D O I L Y → pattern: 1:D, 2:O, 3:I, 4:L, 5:Y → but wait, position 3 is I, not L! We need position 3 to be L, but in this word position 4 is L? So incorrect pattern.

But we need position 3 to be L.

""DOILY"" has I in position 3 and L in position 4? That doesn't match.

Another idea: ""DIZZY"" but no L.

Perhaps ""FILMY"" but M excluded.

It seems inevitable to have a word with double L or accept less common words.

What about ""OILED""? But E excluded.

""QUID"" not 5 letters.

""BUILD"" but no Y.

We must have Y at position 5.

An obscure word: ""XYLYL"" but X,Y,L duplicated and not matching pattern.

Given the constraints, let's go with ""HILLY"" or ""FILLY"". Both are valid words.

We can choose ""HILLY"" to use H.

But note the available letters: If we guess ""HILLY"", we test H at position 1 and implicitly test if L is duplicated at position 4.

If the feedback for position 4 L is:
- If ✓ then L is in position 4 and we solved? But we don't know yet.
- If (-) then L is in the word but position 4 is wrong? But L is already at position 3, so if duplicate L exists, it could be elsewhere? But positions 1 and 5 are H and Y, so unless L is in position 1, but position 1 is H, so it can't be L? Wait.

In ""HILLY"": 
Positions: 1:H, 2:I, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y.

The secret word must have I in pos2, L in pos3, Y in pos5. So the only unknown is position 1 and 4.

If we place L at position 4, and if secret word has L at position 4, it will be ✓; if it doesn't, but has duplicate L, it might be (-) if L is elsewhere? But the only other position is position 1? But position 1 has H in our guess.

So if the secret word has L only at position 3, then L at position 4 in ""HILLY"" will be marked as absent (x) because the single L is already used in position 3 (correctly).

Whereas if secret word has L at position 4 as well (so two L's), then L at position 4 will be marked ✓.

So we can distinguish.

But our goal is to guess the word, so if we guess a possible solution, it's fine.

Another candidate word without double L: ""BIFFY""? Not a word.

""DOGHY""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""DWILY""? Not common.

Another common word: ""VIXEN"" but E and no L.

I think ""HILLY"" is a good guess.

But let's check ""BILLY"": B I L L Y → B available.

Similarly ""DILLY"": D available.

We can choose ""BILLY"".

Or to use a less common letter, but we want information.

Since position 4 is unknown and we need to test a new letter, but if we use L at position 4, we are not testing a new letter. So if we use a new letter, we can get more information.

Therefore, we should prefer a word that has a non-L letter at position 4 to test a new letter.

For example, if we can find a word with pattern _ I L X Y, where X is a new letter.

Such as ""DIGLY""? Not a word.

""BIGLY"" → B I G L Y → pattern: 1:B, 2:I, 3:G, 4:L, 5:Y → so position 3 is G, not L! Invalid for our pattern.

We need position 3 to be L.

Is there a word like ""V I L D Y""? ""Vildy"" not a word.

""W I L O Y"" not a word.

""J I L B Y"" → ""JILBY""? Not a word.

""F I L C H"" but C excluded.

Perhaps ""OIL"" words? ""OILY"" too short.

I think it's not easy, so we might have to go with a double L word or use a less common word.

Another possibility: ""GUILY"" → not a word? Guilty is 6.

""QUILL"" → Q U I L L → but that ends with L, not Y. And positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:L, 5:L → not matching pattern.

But we need Y at position 5.

Let's search for standard words: I recall ""GIDDY"", but no L.

""LILY"" too short.

Perhaps ""UKASE"" but no L or Y.

Given the requirements, there are words like ""DILLY"", ""HILLY"", ""BILLY"", ""FILLY"", ""JILLY"", ""WILLY"", etc.

Let's pick ""WILLY"" (will-y) which is willy? Like Willie is shortened? But ""willy"" is a valid word meaning, for example, a willow basket or informal for willpower.

""WILLY"": W-I-L-L-Y → positions: 1:W, 2:I, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y.

This uses W, which is less common? But available.

Alternatively, we can use ""DOILY"" but it doesn't have L in position 3.

Perhaps ""DAILY"" but A excluded.

So I think ""HILLY"" is fine.

But to test a new letter at position 4, we must avoid L there.

Let's list possible solutions: what 5-letter words end with Y, have I in position 2, L in position 3.

Common ones: ""SILLY"" excluded S.

""FILLY"" is one. ""HILLY"" is another. ""BILLY"". ""DILLY"". ""WILLY"". That's it.

Also ""VILLY"" (not common) or ""ZILLY"" (silly), but Z is available.

""ZILLY"": Z-I-L-L-Y.

Now, other obscure words like ""XYLOL"" but not Y ending and no I.

So we have several options: all with double L.

Since the pattern is rare, and we have to choose from these, we can guess one of them.

But we also have position 1: which can be B,D,F,G,H,J, etc.

We don't have information on position 1.

So to get the most information, since position 4 is L in all candidate solution words, if we guess a word with a non-L at position 4, we rule out the possibility of L at position 4.

But if we guess a candidate solution, we may win or get feedback.

But we have only 6 tries, and this is guess 4, so let's try to guess a word that covers new letters.

For example, if we guess ""WILLY"", we test W and double L.

Similarly, ""BILLY"" tests B.

So let's choose one with a common letter? Or less common?

Since H was available, ""HILLY"" is a good choice.

But let's see the feedback of ""milky"" : we had Y at position 5 correct, so the word ends with Y.

We need to make a guess.

We have letter distribution, but not sure.

We can also guess a word that keeps L at position 3, I at 2, Y at 5, and uses different letters for positions 1 and 4, even if it's not a valid word? No, must be valid.

Another approach: guess a word that has only one L, with a different letter at position 4.

e.g., ""B I L D Y"" — ""Bildy"" not a word.

""G I L O Y"" — ""GILOY""? Not common, but ""giloy"" is plant, sometimes accepted? Might not be.

In words, ""galaxy"" but has A, excluded.

Perhaps ""JULEP"" but no Y.

I think we have to go with the double L words.

Let's pick ""FILLY"" which I think is a valid word (a young horse).

So I'll go with ""FILLY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E (from ""crane""), S, P, T (from ""split""), M, K (from ""milky"").
- **Confirmed positions**: 
  - Position 2: I (from ""milky"" feedback: I is correct).
  - Position 3: L (from ""split"" and ""milky"" feedback).
  - Position 5: Y (from ""milky"" feedback: Y is correct).
- **Pattern**: The secret word must follow the pattern `[unknown] I L [unknown] Y`, where:
  - Position 1 must be a letter not excluded (available: B, D, F, G, H, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).
  - Position 4 must be a letter not excluded (same available set), and cannot be I (since I is confirmed at position 2), L (from feedback rules), or Y (position 5).
- **Additional constraint**: From ""split"" feedback (I is present but wrong position), position 4 cannot be I (already satisfied by the pattern), and no feedback indicates duplicates, so the secret word may or may not have repeated letters.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- The secret word must end with Y (position 5) and have ""IL"" in positions 2–3.
- Common words fitting this pattern with the available letters include ""HILLY"", ""FILLY"", ""BILLY"", ""DILLY"", and ""WILLY""—all have double L (position 4 is L).
- Choose a candidate that tests position 1 with a common letter while respecting exclusions. ""HILLY"" is a valid word that tests ""H"" in position 1 and the potential for double L in position 4.
- Feedback will confirm if:
  - Position 1 is H (if ✓), or provide new information if absent.
  - Position 4 is L (if ✓ or - due to duplicate L), helping narrow down the solution.

Guess: **""HILLY""**",Guess 4: hilly -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
