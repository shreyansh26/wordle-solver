We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 3rd letter)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the 5th letter)

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has A as the 3rd letter and E as the 5th letter. So the pattern is _ _ A _ E.
- The letters C, R, and N are not in the word.

We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter English word.

Constraints:
- Must have A as the 3rd letter and E as the 5th letter: so pattern: ? ? A ? E
- Must avoid using C, R, N (since they are not in the word)

We want to guess a word that gives us more information about the other positions.

Possible words that fit the pattern _ _ A _ E:
We can try words with common letters in the first, second, and fourth positions.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, P, etc.

Let me think of words ending in ""A_E"" (like _ _ A _ E). Examples:
- SLATE: S L A T E -> but T would be the fourth letter. However, we don't know if T is in the word or not.
- PLATE: P L A T E
- SHADE: S H A D E
- BLADE: B L A D E
- STAGE: S T A G E

But note: We also know that the word does not contain C, R, or N. So we must avoid these letters.

Let's check the examples:
- SLATE: uses S, L, T -> none of these are forbidden? But we don't know any of these yet.
- PLATE: P, L, T -> same idea.

However, we have two known correct positions. We can test new letters that we haven't tried.

Since the first guess used: C, R, A, N, E, we know A and E are in the word (and in those positions), but C, R, N are out.

We haven't tested many common consonants: B, D, S, T, L, M, P, etc.

We want to maximize the amount of new information we get.

Let's choose a word that uses several of these untested letters in the first, second, and fourth positions.

One candidate: ""SLATE"" -> pattern: S L A T E -> positions: 1: S, 2: L, 4: T. We don't know if S, L, T are in the word? But T might be common.

Another candidate: ""BLADE"": B L A D E -> positions: 1: B, 2: L, 4: D. Also good.

But note: we must avoid R (which we are not using in this guess) but R is already known absent? And same for C and N.

We can also try ""SHADE"": S H A D E.

I think ""SLATE"" is a good choice because:
- It uses common letters S, L, and T which we haven't tested.
- It fits the pattern: _ _ A _ E -> S L A T E.

However, note that the first guess had 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5, so ""SLATE"" has:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: A (known correct)
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: E (known correct)

So this guess will test S, L, and T.

But wait: what if the word does not have S or L? That feedback will tell us.

Alternatively, we can try a word that might have the possibility of having duplicates? But we don't know yet.

Considering we want to maximize information, ""SLATE"" seems reasonable.

Another option: ""STAGE"" -> S T A G E -> same pattern, tests S, T, and G.

But ""G"" is less common so maybe not as good.

I think ""SLATE"" is a solid choice because it uses common letters.

But note: we know that A and E are already placed, so we are only guessing for positions 1, 2, and 4.

We could choose a word that uses letters we haven't tried at all from the first guess? The first guess used C,R,A,N,E. We don't know anything about B, D, S, T, L, etc.

So let me go with ""SLATE"".

Alternatively, ""PLATE"": P L A T E -> tests P, L, T.

But P is less common than S? S is the most common starting letter.

Another candidate: ""SHADE"" -> tests S, H, D.

H might be less common.

I think ""SLATE"" is a good choice.

But note: we must avoid any letters that are known absent? Known absent are C, R, N. So as long as we don't use those, it's okay.

Therefore, I will guess ""SLATE"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are not in the secret word (x).
- A is correct and in the 3rd position (✓).
- E is correct and in the 5th position (✓).

The secret word must have the pattern: _ _ A _ E.

For the next guess:
- Avoid letters C, R, and N.
- Focus on common English letters to maximize information gain.
- Prioritize words that fit the _ _ A _ E pattern and introduce new untested letters like S, L, T, D, P, etc.

A strong candidate is ""slate"":
- S in position 1 (untested).
- L in position 2 (untested).
- A in position 3 (already confirmed).
- T in position 4 (untested).
- E in position 5 (already confirmed).

We don\'t know if S, L, T are in the word? But T might be common.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BLADE"": B L A D E -> positions: 1: B, 2: L, 4: D. Also good.\n\nBut note: we must avoid R (which we are not using in this guess) but R is already known absent? And same for C and N.\n\nWe can also try ""SHADE"": S H A D E.\n\nI think ""SLATE"" is a good choice because:\n- It uses common letters S, L, and T which we haven\'t tested.\n- It fits the pattern: _ _ A _ E -> S L A T E.\n\nHowever, note that the first guess had \'A\' in position 3 and \'E\' in position 5, so ""SLATE"" has:\n- Position 1: S\n- Position 2: L\n- Position 3: A (known correct)\n- Position 4: T\n- Position 5: E (known correct)\n\nSo this guess will test S, L, and T.\n\nBut wait: what if the word does not have S or L? That feedback will tell us.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that might have the possibility of having duplicates? But we don\'t know yet.\n\nConsidering we want to maximize information, ""SLATE"" seems reasonable.\n\nAnother option: ""STAGE"" -> S T A G E -> same pattern, tests S, T, and G.\n\nBut ""G"" is less common so maybe not as good.\n\nI think ""SLATE"" is a solid choice because it uses common letters.\n\nBut note: we know that A and E are already placed, so we are only guessing for positions 1, 2, and 4.\n\nWe could choose a word that uses letters we haven\'t tried at all from the first guess? The first guess used C,R,A,N,E. We don\'t know anything about B, D, S, T, L, etc.\n\nSo let me go with ""SLATE"".\n\nAlternatively, ""PLATE"": P L A T E -> tests P, L, T.\n\nBut P is less common than S? S is the most common starting letter.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SHADE"" -> tests S, H, D.\n\nH might be less common.\n\nI think ""SLATE"" is a good choice.\n\nBut note: we must avoid any letters that are known absent? Known absent are C, R, N. So as long as we don\'t use those, it\'s okay.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""SLATE"".Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"":\n- C, R, and N are not in the secret word (x).\n- A is correct and in the 3rd position (✓).\n- E is correct and in the 5th position (✓).\n\nThe secret word must have the pattern: _ _ A _ E.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Avoid letters C, R, and N.\n- Focus on common English letters to maximize information gain.\n- Prioritize words that fit the _ _ A _ E pattern and introduce new untested letters like S, L, T, D, P, etc.\n\nA strong candidate is ""slate"":\n- S in position 1 (untested).\n- L in position 2 (untested).\n- A in position 3 (already confirmed).\n- T in position 4 (untested).\n- E in position 5 (already confirmed).\n\nThis tests new letters in positions 1, 2, and 4, helping gather information efficiently.\n\n<guess>slate</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd letter)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, 5th letter)

Guess 2: ""slate""
- S: x (not in the word)
- L: ✓ (correct position, 2nd letter)  [Note: in ""slate"", L is the 2nd letter, so the secret word has L as the 2nd letter]
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd letter)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, 5th letter)

So, from the feedback, we know:

1. The secret word has the pattern: _ L A _ E
   - Position 1: unknown
   - Position 2: L (fixed)
   - Position 3: A (fixed)
   - Position 4: unknown
   - Position 5: E (fixed)

2. Letters that are not in the word: C, R, N, S, T (from the x's)

3. We have two known correct letters: L and A (both in correct positions) and E (correct position). But note, A and E were already known from the first guess.

Now, we need to make a third guess that fits the pattern _ L A _ E and avoids the letters C, R, N, S, T.

We must choose a word that has:
- First letter: any letter except C, R, N, S, T (and not duplicated if we know it's not duplicated, but we don't know yet)
- Second letter: L (must be L, because it's fixed)
- Third letter: A (fixed)
- Fourth letter: any letter except C, R, N, S, T
- Fifth letter: E (fixed)

So the word pattern is: [letter1] L A [letter4] E

We need to choose letter1 and letter4 from the remaining alphabet, avoiding the known absent letters.

Known absent letters: C, R, N, S, T

We also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

Common letters that are not yet tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We want to maximize information. Since we have two unknown positions (1 and 4), we can try to use common letters and also letters that might appear in multiple words to narrow down.

Possible words that fit the pattern:

- BLADE: B L A D E -> but we haven't tested B and D.
- PLATE: but T is absent, so not allowed.
- GLADE: G L A D E
- BLAME: B L A M E
- FLAME: F L A M E
- GLARE: but R is absent -> not allowed.
- BLARE: R absent -> not allowed.
- PLACE: C absent -> not allowed.

We must avoid S, T, C, R, N.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern and avoid the forbidden letters:

- BLADE: B, L, A, D, E -> D is the 4th letter.
- BLAME: B, L, A, M, E
- FLAME: F, L, A, M, E
- GLADE: G, L, A, D, E
- GLARE: has R -> invalid.
- PLATE: has T -> invalid.
- SHADE: has S -> invalid.
- WHALE: W H A L E -> but note: the pattern is _ L A _ E, so the second letter must be L. In ""whale"", the second letter is H, not L. So it doesn't fit.

We need the second letter to be L. So words like ""whale"" (which is W H A L E) have L in the fourth position, not second. So that doesn't match.

Another word: ""BLASE"" -> but S is absent and also the pattern: B L A S E -> but S is the fourth letter? And S is absent, so invalid.

""PLANE"": has N -> absent.

""GLADE"": G L A D E -> this fits.

""BLADE"": B L A D E -> fits.

""BLAME"": B L A M E -> fits.

""FLAME"": F L A M E -> fits.

""GLAME"" is not a word.

""SLATE"" we already tried, and it had S and T which are absent.

Now, we want to test new letters. We haven't tested B, D, G, F, M, etc.

We can choose a word that uses two new letters to maximize information.

For example, ""BLADE"" tests B and D.

""BLAME"" tests B and M.

""FLAME"" tests F and M.

""GLADE"" tests G and D.

We don't know which one is better. But note that we have two unknowns: position 1 and position 4.

We might also consider that the same letter might appear twice? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

Since we have limited guesses, we should pick a word that might be the answer if we are lucky, but also gives information.

But we don't have enough information to guess the word yet.

Another idea: we can use a word that uses a letter that is common in the first position and common in the fourth position.

For example, B is common at the start, and D and M are common in the middle.

But let's look for more words:

- ""ELATE"": but E is already in the fifth, and we have to have L in second. ""ELATE"" is E L A T E -> but T is absent and also the first letter E? But we don't know if E can be duplicated? The feedback for E was in position 5, but it might be the only E? We don't know. However, ""ELATE"" has two E's and T is absent, so invalid.

- ""OLIVE"": doesn't fit pattern.

- ""ALIVE"": A L I V E -> but the pattern requires the third letter to be A? In ""ALIVE"", the A is the first letter, not the third. So it doesn't fit.

We must have the pattern: [1] L A [4] E.

So let's stick to the list: BLADE, BLAME, FLAME, GLADE.

We can also consider:

- ""BLARE"": invalid because of R.
- ""PLANE"": invalid because of N.

Another word: ""BLATE"" -> but T is absent.

""CLADE"": C is absent.

So the options are limited.

We can also consider less common words? But we should stick to common words.

Another one: ""ELUDE"" -> doesn't fit pattern.

""BLUED"": B L U E D -> but the pattern is _ L A _ E, so the third letter must be A. ""BLUED"" has U in the third? So no.

We must have A in the third.

So the list is: BLADE, BLAME, FLAME, GLADE.

Now, which one to choose?

We can choose ""BLADE"" to test B and D.

But note: if we guess ""BLADE"", and if the word is ""BLADE"", we win. Otherwise, we get feedback on B and D.

Similarly for the others.

But we don't have any information about duplicates. For example, if the word is ""BLAME"", then B and M are present, but in ""BLADE"", D would be absent? We don't know.

We can also consider that the first letter might be a vowel? But not necessarily.

Another idea: we can use a word that uses a letter we haven't tried in the first position and a letter that is common.

But let's think about the frequency.

We might also consider that the fourth position might be a vowel? For example, I or O? But in the pattern, the fourth letter can be a vowel or consonant.

Words with the pattern: 

- With I: ""ALIKE"" -> but A is first, not third. ""ELIDE"" -> not matching. ""BLITE"" not a word. ""GLIDE"" -> G L I D E -> but the third letter is I, not A. So no.

- With O: ""BLOAT"" -> T absent. ""GLOAT"" -> T absent. ""BLOKE"" -> O in third? No, pattern requires A in third.

So the fourth letter is likely a consonant: D, M, V, etc.

We have ""BLADE"", ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"", ""GLADE"".

""FLAME"" has F, which is less common than B or G.

Similarly, ""GLADE"" has G.

B is more common than G or F at the start of 5-letter words.

So ""BLADE"" or ""BLAME"" might be better.

Between ""BLADE"" and ""BLAME"", which one? D and M are both common.

We can choose ""BLAME"" because M is a common letter that we haven't tested.

But we also haven't tested D.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses a letter that might be in the word from the first guess? But we don't have any hints.

Another thought: we know that the word has at least A, L, E. And we have two more letters to find.

We can try to think of common words that fit: blade, blame, flame, glade are all reasonable.

But let's check the dictionary: all are valid.

I think ""BLAME"" is a good choice because it tests B and M, and B is common.

But we can also consider that if we guess ""BLAME"" and it's not the word, we get feedback on B and M.

Similarly for ""BLADE"".

But note: we have three more guesses after this? We have 6 tries total, and we are on the third guess.

We can also try to use a word that has a letter that might be duplicated? But we don't know.

I think we should go with ""BLAME"".

But let me see if there's a word that can test more letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.

Another word: ""BELLE"" -> but pattern: B E L L E -> second letter E, not L? And third letter L, not A. Doesn't fit.

""BLAZE"": B L A Z E -> Z is a less common letter. And we haven't tested Z. But it might be acceptable.

But ""BLAZE"" is a word. And Z is not in the absent list.

Similarly, ""BLARE"" is invalid.

""BLASE"" has S, invalid.

So ""BLAZE"" is an option, but Z is less common.

I think it's better to stick with more common letters.

Therefore, I choose ""BLAME"".

So the guess is ""BLAME"".

But let's confirm the pattern: B L A M E -> positions: 1:B, 2:L (correct), 3:A (correct), 4:M, 5:E (correct). And avoids C,R,N,S,T.

Yes.

We might get lucky and it's the word.

If not, we get feedback on B and M.

So, I'll go with ""BLAME"".

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(✓)  
  - This reveals that A is in the 3rd position and E is in the 5th position. C, R, and N are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: slate** → Feedback: S(x), L(✓), A(✓), T(x), E(✓)  
  - This confirms L is in the 2nd position (correct and fixed). S and T are not in the word. A and E remain fixed in positions 3 and 5.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word pattern is: **? L A ? E** (positions: 1=unknown, 2=L, 3=A, 4=unknown, 5=E).
- Absent letters (must avoid): **C, R, N, S, T**.
- Known present letters (in specific positions): **A (pos 3), L (pos 2), E (pos 5)**.
- Unknown positions: 1 and 4 need to be solved, using letters not yet tested (e.g., B, D, G, F, M, P, etc.).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The guess must fit the pattern **? L A ? E** and exclude absent letters (C, R, N, S, T).
- Focus on common English words that test new high-frequency letters (e.g., B, M, D, G) to maximize information about positions 1 and 4.
- Potential candidate words include:
  - **BLADE**: Tests B (pos 1) and D (pos 4).
  - **BLAME**: Tests B (pos 1) and M (pos 4).
  - **FLAME**: Tests F (pos 1) and M (pos 4).
  - **GLADE**: Tests G (pos 1) and D (pos 4).
- **Why choose BLAME?**  
  - B is a high-frequency starting letter, and M is a common letter in position 4.  
  - This tests two new letters (B and M) efficiently, which could quickly narrow down possibilities.  
  - If B or M is incorrect, the feedback will help identify the correct letters for positions 1 and 4.

<guess>blame</guess>",blame,"We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd letter)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, 5th letter)

Guess 2: ""slate""
- S: x (not in the word)

- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd letter)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, 5th letter)

So, from the feedback, we know:

1. The secret word has the pattern: _ L A _ E
   - Position 1: unknown
   - Position 2: L (fixed)
   - Position 3: A (fixed)
   - Position 4: unknown
   - Position 5: E (fixed)

2. Letters that are not in the word: C, R, N, S, T (from the x's)

3. We have two known correct letters: L and A (both in correct positions) and E (correct position). But note, A and E were already known from the first guess.

Now, we need to make a third guess that fits the pattern _ L A _ E and avoids the letters C, R, N, S, T.

We must choose a word that has:

- Second letter: L (must be L, because it's fixed)
- Third letter: A (fixed)
- Fourth letter: any letter except C, R, N, S, T
- Fifth letter: E (fixed)

So the word pattern is: [letter1] L A [letter4] E

We need to choose letter1 and letter4 from the remaining alphabet, avoiding the known absent letters.

Known absent letters: C, R, N, S, T

We also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

Common letters that are not yet tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We want to maximize information. Since we have two unknown positions (1 and 4), we can try to use common letters and also letters that might appear in multiple words to narrow down.

Possible words that fit the pattern:

- BLADE: B L A D E -> but we haven't tested B and D.

- BLAME: B L A M E
- FLAME: F L A M E
- GLARE: but R is absent -> not allowed.
- BLARE: R absent -> not allowed.
- PLACE: C absent -> not allowed.

We must avoid S, T, C, R, N.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern and avoid the forbidden letters:

- BLADE: B, L, A, D, E -> D is the 4th letter.
- BLAME: B, L, A, M, E
- FLAME: F, L, A, M, E
- GLADE: G, L, A, D, E

- SHADE: has S -> invalid.
- WHALE: W H A L E -> but note: the pattern is _ L A _ E, so the second letter must be L. In ""whale"", the second letter is H, not L. So it doesn't fit.

We need the second letter to be L. So words like ""whale"" (which is W H A L E) have L in the fourth position, not second. So that doesn't match.

Another word: ""BLASE"" -> but S is absent and also the pattern: B L A S E -> but S is the fourth letter? And S is absent, so invalid.

""PLANE"": has N -> absent.

""GLADE"": G L A D E -> this fits.

""BLADE"": B L A D E -> fits.

""BLAME"": B L A M E -> fits.

""FLAME"": F L A M E -> fits.

""GLAME"" is not a word.

""SLATE"" we already tried, and it had S and T which are absent.

Now, we want to test new letters. We haven't tested B, D, G, F, M, etc.

We can choose a word that uses two new letters to maximize information.

For example, ""BLADE"" tests B and D.

""BLAME"" tests B and M.

- ""OLIVE"": doesn't fit pattern.

- ""ALIVE"": A L I V E -> but the pattern requires the third letter to be A? In ""ALIVE"", the A is the first letter, not the third. So it doesn't fit.

We must have the pattern: [1] L A [4] E.

So let's stick to the list: BLADE, BLAME, FLAME, GLADE.

We can also consider:

- ""BLARE"": invalid because of R.
- ""PLANE"": invalid because of N.

Another word: ""BLATE"" -> but T is absent.

""CLADE"": C is absent.

So the options are limited.

We can also consider less common words? But we should stick to common words.

Another one: ""ELUDE"" -> doesn't fit pattern.

""BLUED"": B L U E D -> but the pattern is _ L A _ E, so the third letter must be A. ""BLUED"" has U in the third? So no.

We must have A in the third.

So the list is: BLADE, BLAME, FLAME, GLADE.

Now, which one to choose?

We can choose ""BLADE"" to test B and D.

But note: if we guess ""BLADE"", and if the word is ""BLADE"", we win. Otherwise, we get feedback on B and D.

- With O: ""BLOAT"" -> T absent. ""GLOAT"" -> T absent. ""BLOKE"" -> O in third? No, pattern requires A in third.

So the fourth letter is likely a consonant: D, M, V, etc.

We have ""BLADE"", ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"", ""GLADE"".

""FLAME"" has F, which is less common than B or G.

Similarly, ""GLADE"" has G.

B is more common than G or F at the start of 5-letter words.

So ""BLADE"" or ""BLAME"" might be better.

Between ""BLADE"" and ""BLAME"", which one? D and M are both common.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 3rd letter)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the 5th letter)

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has A as the 3rd letter and E as the 5th letter. So the pattern is _ _ A _ E.
- The letters C, R, and N are not in the word.

We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter English word.

Constraints:
- Must have A as the 3rd letter and E as the 5th letter: so pattern: ? ? A ? E
- Must avoid using C, R, N (since they are not in the word)

We want to guess a word that gives us more information about the other positions.

Possible words that fit the pattern _ _ A _ E:
We can try words with common letters in the first, second, and fourth positions.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, P, etc.

Let me think of words ending in ""A_E"" (like _ _ A _ E). Examples:
- SLATE: S L A T E -> but T would be the fourth letter. However, we don't know if T is in the word or not.
- PLATE: P L A T E
- SHADE: S H A D E
- BLADE: B L A D E
- STAGE: S T A G E

But note: We also know that the word does not contain C, R, or N. So we must avoid these letters.

Let's check the examples:
- SLATE: uses S, L, T -> none of these are forbidden? But we don't know any of these yet.
- PLATE: P, L, T -> same idea.

However, we have two known correct positions. We can test new letters that we haven't tried.

Since the first guess used: C, R, A, N, E, we know A and E are in the word (and in those positions), but C, R, N are out.

We haven't tested many common consonants: B, D, S, T, L, M, P, etc.

We want to maximize the amount of new information we get.

Let's choose a word that uses several of these untested letters in the first, second, and fourth positions.

One candidate: ""SLATE"" -> pattern: S L A T E -> positions: 1: S, 2: L, 4: T. We don't know if S, L, T are in the word? But T might be common.

Another candidate: ""BLADE"": B L A D E -> positions: 1: B, 2: L, 4: D. Also good.

But note: we must avoid R (which we are not using in this guess) but R is already known absent? And same for C and N.

We can also try ""SHADE"": S H A D E.

I think ""SLATE"" is a good choice because:
- It uses common letters S, L, and T which we haven't tested.
- It fits the pattern: _ _ A _ E -> S L A T E.

However, note that the first guess had 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5, so ""SLATE"" has:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: A (known correct)
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: E (known correct)

So this guess will test S, L, and T.

But wait: what if the word does not have S or L? That feedback will tell us.

Alternatively, we can try a word that might have the possibility of having duplicates? But we don't know yet.

Considering we want to maximize information, ""SLATE"" seems reasonable.

Another option: ""STAGE"" -> S T A G E -> same pattern, tests S, T, and G.

But ""G"" is less common so maybe not as good.

I think ""SLATE"" is a solid choice because it uses common letters.

But note: we know that A and E are already placed, so we are only guessing for positions 1, 2, and 4.

We could choose a word that uses letters we haven't tried at all from the first guess? The first guess used C,R,A,N,E. We don't know anything about B, D, S, T, L, etc.

So let me go with ""SLATE"".

Alternatively, ""PLATE"": P L A T E -> tests P, L, T.

But P is less common than S? S is the most common starting letter.

Another candidate: ""SHADE"" -> tests S, H, D.

H might be less common.

I think ""SLATE"" is a good choice.

But note: we must avoid any letters that are known absent? Known absent are C, R, N. So as long as we don't use those, it's okay.

Therefore, I will guess ""SLATE"".Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are not in the secret word (x).
- A is correct and in the 3rd position (✓).
- E is correct and in the 5th position (✓).

The secret word must have the pattern: _ _ A _ E.

For the next guess:
- Avoid letters C, R, and N.
- Focus on common English letters to maximize information gain.
- Prioritize words that fit the _ _ A _ E pattern and introduce new untested letters like S, L, T, D, P, etc.

A strong candidate is ""slate"":
- S in position 1 (untested).
- L in position 2 (untested).
- A in position 3 (already confirmed).
- T in position 4 (untested).
- E in position 5 (already confirmed).

This tests new letters in positions 1, 2, and 4, helping gather information efficiently.

<guess>slate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd letter)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, 5th letter)

Guess 2: ""slate""
- S: x (not in the word)
- L: ✓ (correct position, 2nd letter)  [Note: in ""slate"", L is the 2nd letter, so the secret word has L as the 2nd letter]
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd letter)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, 5th letter)

So, from the feedback, we know:

1. The secret word has the pattern: _ L A _ E
   - Position 1: unknown
   - Position 2: L (fixed)
   - Position 3: A (fixed)
   - Position 4: unknown
   - Position 5: E (fixed)

2. Letters that are not in the word: C, R, N, S, T (from the x's)

3. We have two known correct letters: L and A (both in correct positions) and E (correct position). But note, A and E were already known from the first guess.

Now, we need to make a third guess that fits the pattern _ L A _ E and avoids the letters C, R, N, S, T.

We must choose a word that has:
- First letter: any letter except C, R, N, S, T (and not duplicated if we know it's not duplicated, but we don't know yet)
- Second letter: L (must be L, because it's fixed)
- Third letter: A (fixed)
- Fourth letter: any letter except C, R, N, S, T
- Fifth letter: E (fixed)

So the word pattern is: [letter1] L A [letter4] E

We need to choose letter1 and letter4 from the remaining alphabet, avoiding the known absent letters.

Known absent letters: C, R, N, S, T

We also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

Common letters that are not yet tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We want to maximize information. Since we have two unknown positions (1 and 4), we can try to use common letters and also letters that might appear in multiple words to narrow down.

Possible words that fit the pattern:

- BLADE: B L A D E -> but we haven't tested B and D.
- PLATE: but T is absent, so not allowed.
- GLADE: G L A D E
- BLAME: B L A M E
- FLAME: F L A M E
- GLARE: but R is absent -> not allowed.
- BLARE: R absent -> not allowed.
- PLACE: C absent -> not allowed.

We must avoid S, T, C, R, N.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern and avoid the forbidden letters:

- BLADE: B, L, A, D, E -> D is the 4th letter.
- BLAME: B, L, A, M, E
- FLAME: F, L, A, M, E
- GLADE: G, L, A, D, E
- GLARE: has R -> invalid.
- PLATE: has T -> invalid.
- SHADE: has S -> invalid.
- WHALE: W H A L E -> but note: the pattern is _ L A _ E, so the second letter must be L. In ""whale"", the second letter is H, not L. So it doesn't fit.

We need the second letter to be L. So words like ""whale"" (which is W H A L E) have L in the fourth position, not second. So that doesn't match.

Another word: ""BLASE"" -> but S is absent and also the pattern: B L A S E -> but S is the fourth letter? And S is absent, so invalid.

""PLANE"": has N -> absent.

""GLADE"": G L A D E -> this fits.

""BLADE"": B L A D E -> fits.

""BLAME"": B L A M E -> fits.

""FLAME"": F L A M E -> fits.

""GLAME"" is not a word.

""SLATE"" we already tried, and it had S and T which are absent.

Now, we want to test new letters. We haven't tested B, D, G, F, M, etc.

We can choose a word that uses two new letters to maximize information.

For example, ""BLADE"" tests B and D.

""BLAME"" tests B and M.

""FLAME"" tests F and M.

""GLADE"" tests G and D.

We don't know which one is better. But note that we have two unknowns: position 1 and position 4.

We might also consider that the same letter might appear twice? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

Since we have limited guesses, we should pick a word that might be the answer if we are lucky, but also gives information.

But we don't have enough information to guess the word yet.

Another idea: we can use a word that uses a letter that is common in the first position and common in the fourth position.

For example, B is common at the start, and D and M are common in the middle.

But let's look for more words:

- ""ELATE"": but E is already in the fifth, and we have to have L in second. ""ELATE"" is E L A T E -> but T is absent and also the first letter E? But we don't know if E can be duplicated? The feedback for E was in position 5, but it might be the only E? We don't know. However, ""ELATE"" has two E's and T is absent, so invalid.

- ""OLIVE"": doesn't fit pattern.

- ""ALIVE"": A L I V E -> but the pattern requires the third letter to be A? In ""ALIVE"", the A is the first letter, not the third. So it doesn't fit.

We must have the pattern: [1] L A [4] E.

So let's stick to the list: BLADE, BLAME, FLAME, GLADE.

We can also consider:

- ""BLARE"": invalid because of R.
- ""PLANE"": invalid because of N.

Another word: ""BLATE"" -> but T is absent.

""CLADE"": C is absent.

So the options are limited.

We can also consider less common words? But we should stick to common words.

Another one: ""ELUDE"" -> doesn't fit pattern.

""BLUED"": B L U E D -> but the pattern is _ L A _ E, so the third letter must be A. ""BLUED"" has U in the third? So no.

We must have A in the third.

So the list is: BLADE, BLAME, FLAME, GLADE.

Now, which one to choose?

We can choose ""BLADE"" to test B and D.

But note: if we guess ""BLADE"", and if the word is ""BLADE"", we win. Otherwise, we get feedback on B and D.

Similarly for the others.

But we don't have any information about duplicates. For example, if the word is ""BLAME"", then B and M are present, but in ""BLADE"", D would be absent? We don't know.

We can also consider that the first letter might be a vowel? But not necessarily.

Another idea: we can use a word that uses a letter we haven't tried in the first position and a letter that is common.

But let's think about the frequency.

We might also consider that the fourth position might be a vowel? For example, I or O? But in the pattern, the fourth letter can be a vowel or consonant.

Words with the pattern: 

- With I: ""ALIKE"" -> but A is first, not third. ""ELIDE"" -> not matching. ""BLITE"" not a word. ""GLIDE"" -> G L I D E -> but the third letter is I, not A. So no.

- With O: ""BLOAT"" -> T absent. ""GLOAT"" -> T absent. ""BLOKE"" -> O in third? No, pattern requires A in third.

So the fourth letter is likely a consonant: D, M, V, etc.

We have ""BLADE"", ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"", ""GLADE"".

""FLAME"" has F, which is less common than B or G.

Similarly, ""GLADE"" has G.

B is more common than G or F at the start of 5-letter words.

So ""BLADE"" or ""BLAME"" might be better.

Between ""BLADE"" and ""BLAME"", which one? D and M are both common.

We can choose ""BLAME"" because M is a common letter that we haven't tested.

But we also haven't tested D.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses a letter that might be in the word from the first guess? But we don't have any hints.

Another thought: we know that the word has at least A, L, E. And we have two more letters to find.

We can try to think of common words that fit: blade, blame, flame, glade are all reasonable.

But let's check the dictionary: all are valid.

I think ""BLAME"" is a good choice because it tests B and M, and B is common.

But we can also consider that if we guess ""BLAME"" and it's not the word, we get feedback on B and M.

Similarly for ""BLADE"".

But note: we have three more guesses after this? We have 6 tries total, and we are on the third guess.

We can also try to use a word that has a letter that might be duplicated? But we don't know.

I think we should go with ""BLAME"".

But let me see if there's a word that can test more letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.

Another word: ""BELLE"" -> but pattern: B E L L E -> second letter E, not L? And third letter L, not A. Doesn't fit.

""BLAZE"": B L A Z E -> Z is a less common letter. And we haven't tested Z. But it might be acceptable.

But ""BLAZE"" is a word. And Z is not in the absent list.

Similarly, ""BLARE"" is invalid.

""BLASE"" has S, invalid.

So ""BLAZE"" is an option, but Z is less common.

I think it's better to stick with more common letters.

Therefore, I choose ""BLAME"".

So the guess is ""BLAME"".

But let's confirm the pattern: B L A M E -> positions: 1:B, 2:L (correct), 3:A (correct), 4:M, 5:E (correct). And avoids C,R,N,S,T.

Yes.

We might get lucky and it's the word.

If not, we get feedback on B and M.

So, I'll go with ""BLAME"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(✓)  
  - This reveals that A is in the 3rd position and E is in the 5th position. C, R, and N are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: slate** → Feedback: S(x), L(✓), A(✓), T(x), E(✓)  
  - This confirms L is in the 2nd position (correct and fixed). S and T are not in the word. A and E remain fixed in positions 3 and 5.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word pattern is: **? L A ? E** (positions: 1=unknown, 2=L, 3=A, 4=unknown, 5=E).
- Absent letters (must avoid): **C, R, N, S, T**.
- Known present letters (in specific positions): **A (pos 3), L (pos 2), E (pos 5)**.
- Unknown positions: 1 and 4 need to be solved, using letters not yet tested (e.g., B, D, G, F, M, P, etc.).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The guess must fit the pattern **? L A ? E** and exclude absent letters (C, R, N, S, T).
- Focus on common English words that test new high-frequency letters (e.g., B, M, D, G) to maximize information about positions 1 and 4.
- Potential candidate words include:
  - **BLADE**: Tests B (pos 1) and D (pos 4).
  - **BLAME**: Tests B (pos 1) and M (pos 4).
  - **FLAME**: Tests F (pos 1) and M (pos 4).
  - **GLADE**: Tests G (pos 1) and D (pos 4).
- **Why choose BLAME?**  
  - B is a high-frequency starting letter, and M is a common letter in position 4.  
  - This tests two new letters (B and M) efficiently, which could quickly narrow down possibilities.  
  - If B or M is incorrect, the feedback will help identify the correct letters for positions 1 and 4.

Since we have two unknown positions (1 and 4), we can try to use common letters and also letters that might appear in multiple words to narrow down.\n\nPossible words that fit the pattern:\n\n- BLADE: B L A D E -> but we haven\'t tested B and D.\n- PLATE: but T is absent, so not allowed.\n- GLADE: G L A D E\n- BLAME: B L A M E\n- FLAME: F L A M E\n- GLARE: but R is absent -> not allowed.\n- BLARE: R absent -> not allowed.\n- PLACE: C absent -> not allowed.\n\nWe must avoid S, T, C, R, N.\n\nLet me list some words that fit the pattern and avoid the forbidden letters:\n\n- BLADE: B, L, A, D, E -> D is the 4th letter.\n- BLAME: B, L, A, M, E\n- FLAME: F, L, A, M, E\n- GLADE: G, L, A, D, E\n- GLARE: has R -> invalid.\n- PLATE: has T -> invalid.\n- SHADE: has S -> invalid.\n- WHALE: W H A L E -> but note: the pattern is _ L A _ E, so the second letter must be L. In ""whale"", the second letter is H, not L. So it doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe need the second letter to be L. So words like ""whale"" (which is W H A L E) have L in the fourth position, not second. So that doesn\'t match.\n\nAnother word: ""BLASE"" -> but S is absent and also the pattern: B L A S E -> but S is the fourth letter? And S is absent, so invalid.\n\n""PLANE"": has N -> absent.\n\n""GLADE"": G L A D E -> this fits.\n\n""BLADE"": B L A D E -> fits.\n\n""BLAME"": B L A M E -> fits.\n\n""FLAME"": F L A M E -> fits.\n\n""GLAME"" is not a word.\n\n""SLATE"" we already tried, and it had S and T which are absent.\n\nNow, we want to test new letters. We haven\'t tested B, D, G, F, M, etc.\n\nWe can choose a word that uses two new letters to maximize information.\n\nFor example, ""BLADE"" tests B and D.\n\n""BLAME"" tests B and M.\n\n""FLAME"" tests F and M.\n\n""GLADE"" tests G and D.\n\nWe don\'t know which one is better. But note that we have two unknowns: position 1 and position 4.\n\nWe might also consider that the same letter might appear twice? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates yet.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we should pick a word that might be the answer if we are lucky, but also gives information.\n\nBut we don\'t have enough information to guess the word yet.\n\nAnother idea: we can use a word that uses a letter that is common in the first position and common in the fourth position.\n\nFor example, B is common at the start, and D and M are common in the middle.\n\nBut let\'s look for more words:\n\n- ""ELATE"": but E is already in the fifth, and we have to have L in second. ""ELATE"" is E L A T E -> but T is absent and also the first letter E? But we don\'t know if E can be duplicated? The feedback for E was in position 5, but it might be the only E? We don\'t know. However, ""ELATE"" has two E\'s and T is absent, so invalid.\n\n- ""OLIVE"": doesn\'t fit pattern.\n\n- ""ALIVE"": A L I V E -> but the pattern requires the third letter to be A? In ""ALIVE"", the A is the first letter, not the third. So it doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe must have the pattern: [1] L A [4] E.\n\nSo let\'s stick to the list: BLADE, BLAME, FLAME, GLADE.\n\nWe can also consider:\n\n- ""BLARE"": invalid because of R.\n- ""PLANE"": invalid because of N.\n\nAnother word: ""BLATE"" -> but T is absent.\n\n""CLADE"": C is absent.\n\nSo the options are limited.\n\nWe can also consider less common words? But we should stick to common words.\n\nAnother one: ""ELUDE"" -> doesn\'t fit pattern.\n\n""BLUED"": B L U E D -> but the pattern is _ L A _ E, so the third letter must be A. ""BLUED"" has U in the third? So no.\n\nWe must have A in the third.\n\nSo the list is: BLADE, BLAME, FLAME, GLADE.\n\nNow, which one to choose?\n\nWe can choose ""BLADE"" to test B and D.\n\nBut note: if we guess ""BLADE"", and if the word is ""BLADE"", we win. Otherwise, we get feedback on B and D.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nBut we don\'t have any information about duplicates. For example, if the word is ""BLAME"", then B and M are present, but in ""BLADE"", D would be absent? We don\'t know.\n\nWe can also consider that the first letter might be a vowel? But not necessarily.\n\nAnother idea: we can use a word that uses a letter we haven\'t tried in the first position and a letter that is common.\n\nBut let\'s think about the frequency.\n\nWe might also consider that the fourth position might be a vowel? For example, I or O? But in the pattern, the fourth letter can be a vowel or consonant.\n\nWords with the pattern: \n\n- With I: ""ALIKE"" -> but A is first, not third. ""ELIDE"" -> not matching. ""BLITE"" not a word. ""GLIDE"" -> G L I D E -> but the third letter is I, not A. So no.\n\n- With O: ""BLOAT"" -> T absent. ""GLOAT"" -> T absent. ""BLOKE"" -> O in third? No, pattern requires A in third.\n\nSo the fourth letter is likely a consonant: D, M, V, etc.\n\nWe have ""BLADE"", ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"", ""GLADE"".\n\n""FLAME"" has F, which is less common than B or G.\n\nSimilarly, ""GLADE"" has G.\n\nB is more common than G or F at the start of 5-letter words.\n\nSo ""BLADE"" or ""BLAME"" might be better.\n\nBetween ""BLADE"" and ""BLAME"", which one? D and M are both common.\n\nWe can choose ""BLAME"" because M is a common letter that we haven\'t tested.\n\nBut we also haven\'t tested D.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that uses a letter that might be in the word from the first guess? But we don\'t have any hints.\n\nAnother thought: we know that the word has at least A, L, E. And we have two more letters to find.\n\nWe can try to think of common words that fit: blade, blame, flame, glade are all reasonable.\n\nBut let\'s check the dictionary: all are valid.\n\nI think ""BLAME"" is a good choice because it tests B and M, and B is common.\n\nBut we can also consider that if we guess ""BLAME"" and it\'s not the word, we get feedback on B and M.\n\nSimilarly for ""BLADE"".\n\nBut note: we have three more guesses after this? We have 6 tries total, and we are on the third guess.\n\nWe can also try to use a word that has a letter that might be duplicated? But we don\'t know.\n\nI think we should go with ""BLAME"".\n\nBut let me see if there\'s a word that can test more letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nAnother word: ""BELLE"" -> but pattern: B E L L E -> second letter E, not L? And third letter L, not A. Doesn\'t fit.\n\n""BLAZE"": B L A Z E -> Z is a less common letter. And we haven\'t tested Z. But it might be acceptable.\n\nBut ""BLAZE"" is a word. And Z is not in the absent list.\n\nSimilarly, ""BLARE"" is invalid.\n\n""BLASE"" has S, invalid.\n\nSo ""BLAZE"" is an option, but Z is less common.\n\nI think it\'s better to stick with more common letters.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""BLAME"".\n\nSo the guess is ""BLAME"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: B L A M E -> positions: 1:B, 2:L (correct), 3:A (correct), 4:M, 5:E (correct). And avoids C,R,N,S,T.\n\nYes.\n\nWe might get lucky and it\'s the word.\n\nIf not, we get feedback on B and M.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""BLAME"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(✓)  \n  - This reveals that A is in the 3rd position and E is in the 5th position. C, R, and N are not in the word.\n\n- **Guess 2: slate** → Feedback: S(x), L(✓), A(✓), T(x), E(✓)  \n  - This confirms L is in the 2nd position (correct and fixed). S and T are not in the word. A and E remain fixed in positions 3 and 5.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word pattern is: **? L A ? E** (positions: 1=unknown, 2=L, 3=A, 4=unknown, 5=E).\n- Absent letters (must avoid): **C, R, N, S, T**.\n- Known present letters (in specific positions): **A (pos 3), L (pos 2), E (pos 5)**.\n- Unknown positions: 1 and 4 need to be solved, using letters not yet tested (e.g., B, D, G, F, M, P, etc.).\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- The guess must fit the pattern **? L A ? E** and exclude absent letters (C, R, N, S, T).\n- Focus on common English words that test new high-frequency letters (e.g., B, M, D, G) to maximize information about positions 1 and 4.\n- Potential candidate words include:\n  - **BLADE**: Tests B (pos 1) and D (pos 4).\n  - **BLAME**: Tests B (pos 1) and M (pos 4).\n  - **FLAME**: Tests F (pos 1) and M (pos 4).\n  - **GLADE**: Tests G (pos 1) and D (pos 4).\n- **Why choose BLAME?**  \n  - B is a high-frequency starting letter, and M is a common letter in position 4.  \n  - This tests two new letters (B and M) efficiently, which could quickly narrow down possibilities.  \n  - If B or M is incorrect, the feedback will help identify the correct letters for positions 1 and 4.\n\n<guess>blame</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: blame -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) L(✓) A(✓) M(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from the first three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd letter)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, 5th letter)

Guess 2: ""slate""
- S: x (not in the word)
- L: ✓ (correct position, 2nd letter)
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd letter)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, 5th letter)

Guess 3: ""blame""
- B: ✓ (correct position, 1st letter)  [This is new! So B is the 1st letter]
- L: ✓ (correct position, 2nd letter)
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd letter)
- M: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, 5th letter)

So now we know:
- The secret word starts with B, and the pattern is: B L A _ E
- We know the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th letters: B, L, A, E respectively.
- The only unknown is the 4th letter.
- Additionally, we know that C, R, N, S, T, M are not in the word (since they were marked as absent).

Therefore, we need to find a 5-letter English word that matches the pattern ""B L A _ E"", and the 4th letter must not be C, R, N, S, T, M or any other letter already excluded.

What are the possible letters for the 4th position?
- Since it must be a letter we haven't tried and that isn't excluded, we can consider the remaining alphabet excluding:
  - Known absent: C, R, N, S, T, M
  - And the letters we know are present: B, L, A, E (but note that these are already placed, so the 4th letter must be a new letter, and also since E is already used, it might be duplicated? But we don't know yet).

We should avoid using the absent letters: C, R, N, S, T, M.

But note: the letter in position 4 could be a duplicate of B, L, A, or E? We have no information yet about duplicates. So it could be one of these letters if the word has duplicates.

However, considering common words:
- The word is likely ""BLADE"", ""BLAZE"", or something else? But ""BLADE"" has D, which hasn't been tested yet. Similarly, ""BLAZE"" has Z.

Possibilities:
- We already tried ""BLAME"" and M was absent. So what other words fit the pattern?

Common words with pattern ""B L A ? E"":
- BLADE: B L A D E -> 4th letter D.
- BLAZE: B L A Z E -> 4th letter Z.
- BLARE: but R is absent -> invalid.
- BLATE: T absent -> invalid.
- BLASE: S absent -> invalid.
- So BLADE and BLAZE are candidates.

But also, are there other words?
- BLAPE? Not a word.
- BLANE: N absent -> invalid.
- BLAME: we tried, M absent.
- So BLADE and BLAZE are the most common.

But also, what about BLEED? But the pattern is B L A _ E, so the third letter must be A. BLEED has E in the third? Not matching.

Or BLAME we tried.

Now, we haven't tested D and Z.

But note: we must use a valid English word.

We can also consider if there might be duplicates? For example, is ""BELLE"" possible? But that doesn't match because it has two L's and E in third? Also the pattern must have A in third.

Possibly, if the word has an E duplicated? Like ""BELIE""? But that is B E L I E -> third letter is L, not A. Doesn't match.

So the only realistic guesses are ""BLADE"" or ""BLAZE"".

Between the two, ""BLADE"" is more common and uses a letter D which is more frequent than Z.

Moreover, D is a common letter in English words.

Alternatively, we might have ""BLAND"", but N is absent.

Or ""BLAST"", but S is absent.

So we should guess ""BLADE"".

But what if the word is ""BLADE""? Then we win.

If not, then we learn that D is absent? Or if D is not the right letter, then we try Z.

But note: we have three guesses left? After this one, two more? Total 6 guesses, we are on the fourth.

We might as well guess ""BLADE"" because if it's correct, we win, otherwise, we know that D is absent, so the word might be ""BLAZE"" or something else.

But are there other words?

What about ""BLATE""? T absent.

""BLIVE""? Not a word.

""BLUEE""? Not a word.

Another word: ""BLAKE"" -> but K is a possibility? And ""BLAKE"" is a name? But the game might use common words, and ""BLAKE"" might be accepted? But let's stick to standard words.

In Wordle, ""BLADE"" is accepted, and ""BLAZE"" is also accepted.

But also, ""BLAND"" is invalid because of N absent.

So, if we guess ""BLADE"", and if the feedback shows:
- If D is correct, then we win.
- If D is wrong (either absent or wrong position), but since position 4 is the only unknown and pattern must be B L A _ E, if D is not correct, then it must be another letter.

But D could be absent? Then we would know to try another letter in position 4.

So after this guess, we can narrow it down.

Given that, we can guess ""BLADE"".

For the sake of efficiency, since we have the pattern, we can guess the most common word.

I think ""BLADE"" is more common than ""BLAZE"".

Therefore, I will guess ""BLADE"".Based on the cumulative feedback:

- **Pattern**: The word must be **B L A ? E** (letters known: position 1=B, 2=L, 3=A, 5=E).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, T, M (from previous feedback).  
- **Goal**: Find the 4th letter using a valid English word.  

### Reasoning:  
1. The only unknown is the 4th letter, which cannot be C, R, N, S, T, or M (since these are marked absent).  
2. Possible candidates include words like **BLADE** (D in position 4) or **BLAZE** (Z in position 4), as these are common English words fitting the pattern and avoiding absent letters.  
3. **Why choose BLADE?**  
   - D is a more frequent letter than Z, making ""BLADE"" statistically more likely.  
   - If ""BLADE"" is correct, the game ends. If not, feedback on D will confirm if it’s absent or present (though position 4 is the only slot left).  

Thus, **BLADE** is the optimal guess to solve the word efficiently.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback History**:
   - **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(✓):  
     - A is in position 3, E is in position 5. C, R, N are absent.
   - **Guess 2: slate** → S(x), L(✓), A(✓), T(x), E(✓):  
     - L is in position 2. S and T are absent. Pattern now: ? L A ? E.
   - **Guess 3: blame** → B(✓), L(✓), A(✓), M(x), E(✓):  
     - B is in position 1. M is absent. Pattern is now fully fixed except position 4: **B L A ? E**.

2. **Constraints for Next Guess**:
   - The secret word must be **B L A _ E** (positions: 1=B, 2=L, 3=A, 5=E).
   - Absent letters: **C, R, N, S, T, M** (from all feedback).
   - The 4th letter must be:
     - A new letter not tested yet (or not explicitly ruled out).
     - Cannot be any absent letter.
     - Potentially a duplicate of existing letters (e.g., E), but duplicates are unsupported yet.

3. **Possible Words**:
   - Valid English words fitting **B L A ? E** and avoiding absent letters include:
     - **BLADE** (D in position 4).
     - **BLAZE** (Z in position 4).
   - Other options like BLARE (R absent) or BLAME (M absent) are invalid.

4. **Optimal Choice**:
   - **BLADE** prioritizes:
     - Common letters: D is more frequent than Z in English.
     - Efficiency: If correct, solve the puzzle immediately.
     - Information: If incorrect, feedback on D confirms absence (narrowing to BLAZE).

5. **Final Decision**:
   - Guess **BLADE** to test D in position 4 while leveraging known patterns and absent letters.

<guess>blade</guess>",blade,"We are given feedback from the first three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd letter)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, 5th letter)

Guess 2: ""slate""
- S: x (not in the word)
- L: ✓ (correct position, 2nd letter)
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd letter)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, 5th letter)

Guess 3: ""blame""
- B: ✓ (correct position, 1st letter)  [This is new! So B is the 1st letter]
- L: ✓ (correct position, 2nd letter)
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd letter)
- M: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, 5th letter)

So now we know:
- The secret word starts with B, and the pattern is: B L A _ E
- We know the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th letters: B, L, A, E respectively.
- The only unknown is the 4th letter.
- Additionally, we know that C, R, N, S, T, M are not in the word (since they were marked as absent).

Therefore, we need to find a 5-letter English word that matches the pattern ""B L A _ E"", and the 4th letter must not be C, R, N, S, T, M or any other letter already excluded.

What are the possible letters for the 4th position?
- Since it must be a letter we haven't tried and that isn't excluded, we can consider the remaining alphabet excluding:
  - Known absent: C, R, N, S, T, M
  - And the letters we know are present: B, L, A, E (but note that these are already placed, so the 4th letter must be a new letter, and also since E is already used, it might be duplicated? But we don't know yet).

We should avoid using the absent letters: C, R, N, S, T, M.

But note: the letter in position 4 could be a duplicate of B, L, A, or E? We have no information yet about duplicates. So it could be one of these letters if the word has duplicates.

However, considering common words:
- The word is likely ""BLADE"", ""BLAZE"", or something else? But ""BLADE"" has D, which hasn't been tested yet. Similarly, ""BLAZE"" has Z.

Possibilities:
- We already tried ""BLAME"" and M was absent. So what other words fit the pattern?

Common words with pattern ""B L A ? E"":
- BLADE: B L A D E -> 4th letter D.
- BLAZE: B L A Z E -> 4th letter Z.
- BLARE: but R is absent -> invalid.
- BLATE: T absent -> invalid.
- BLASE: S absent -> invalid.
- So BLADE and BLAZE are candidates.

But also, are there other words?
- BLAPE? Not a word.
- BLANE: N absent -> invalid.
- BLAME: we tried, M absent.
- So BLADE and BLAZE are the most common.

But also, what about BLEED? But the pattern is B L A _ E, so the third letter must be A. BLEED has E in the third? Not matching.

Or BLAME we tried.

Now, we haven't tested D and Z.

But note: we must use a valid English word.

We can also consider if there might be duplicates? For example, is ""BELLE"" possible? But that doesn't match because it has two L's and E in third? Also the pattern must have A in third.

Possibly, if the word has an E duplicated? Like ""BELIE""? But that is B E L I E -> third letter is L, not A. Doesn't match.

So the only realistic guesses are ""BLADE"" or ""BLAZE"".

Between the two, ""BLADE"" is more common and uses a letter D which is more frequent than Z.

Moreover, D is a common letter in English words.

Alternatively, we might have ""BLAND"", but N is absent.

Or ""BLAST"", but S is absent.

So we should guess ""BLADE"".

But what if the word is ""BLADE""? Then we win.

If not, then we learn that D is absent? Or if D is not the right letter, then we try Z.

But note: we have three guesses left? After this one, two more? Total 6 guesses, we are on the fourth.

We might as well guess ""BLADE"" because if it's correct, we win, otherwise, we know that D is absent, so the word might be ""BLAZE"" or something else.

What about ""BLATE""? T absent.

""BLIVE""? Not a word.

""BLUEE""? Not a word.

Another word: ""BLAKE"" -> but K is a possibility? And ""BLAKE"" is a name? But the game might use common words, and ""BLAKE"" might be accepted? But let's stick to standard words.

In Wordle, ""BLADE"" is accepted, and ""BLAZE"" is also accepted.

But also, ""BLAND"" is invalid because of N absent.

So, if we guess ""BLADE"", and if the feedback shows:
- If D is correct, then we win.
- If D is wrong (either absent or wrong position), but since position 4 is the only unknown and pattern must be B L A _ E, if D is not correct, then it must be another letter.

But D could be absent? Then we would know to try another letter in position 4.

So after this guess, we can narrow it down.

Given that, we can guess ""BLADE"".

For the sake of efficiency, since we have the pattern, we can guess the most common word.

I think ""BLADE"" is more common than ""BLAZE"".

Therefore, I will guess ""BLADE"".Based on the cumulative feedback:

- **Goal**: Find the 4th letter using a valid English word.
