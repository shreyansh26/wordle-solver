We are starting the game. We need to make the first guess.
 Since there is no prior feedback to rely on, we should choose a word that has a good distribution of common letters to maximize the information we get.

 Common starting words in games like Wordle often use words with common vowels and consonants. 
 For example, words like ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", or ""RAISE"" are popular.

 I'll choose ""CRATE"" because it has C, R, A, T, E: common consonants and two vowels (A and E).

 However, note that the feedback will be given for a 5-letter word. We'll receive feedback for each letter.

 So, my first guess is ""CRATE"".

We have feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"": 
 C: x -> not in the secret word
 R: x -> not in the secret word
 A: - -> present in the secret word but not in the correct position
 T: x -> not in the secret word
 E: x -> not in the secret word

 What we know:
 - The letter A is in the word, but not as the third letter (since position 3 in our guess was A, but it got ""-"" meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, and it must be in one of these positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is incorrect). But note, the positions are 1-based: 
 Position 1: C (x)
 Position 2: R (x)
 Position 3: A (-) -> so A is elsewhere
 Position 4: T (x)
 Position 5: E (x)

 So, for our next guess, we need to use words that incorporate the letter A in positions that are not 3. Also, we must avoid C, R, T, E.

 Let's think of a word that has A, and uses other common letters to maximize new information.

 Common vowels: besides A, we have I, O, U. But note, we can also use consonants that haven't been eliminated.

 Eliminated letters: C, R, T, E.
 We should avoid these letters.

 We might want to use common letters like S, N, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

 Since A is misplaced from position 3, let's try putting A in different positions.

 Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

 One idea: try words with A in position 1? But we don't know if that's the case. We could also put it in position 4 or 5.

 But note: we have not tried many consonants yet. Let's pick a word that has A and other common letters.

 Some words to consider:
 - SALAD: has two A's? But we don't know if the word has multiple A's. But our feedback didn't indicate that A is repeated, but it doesn't rule it out either. However, from the feedback, we only know one A is present because only one was in the guess? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about multiple occurrences unless we have multiple in the guess. So ""SALAD"" uses S, A, L, D. But we haven't tested S, L, D.

 However, note that in ""CRATE"", the letter A was in the third position and we got a '-', meaning there's at least one A elsewhere. If the secret word had two A's and one was in position 3, then that A would have been marked as '-'? Actually, the feedback system: for each letter in the guess, we compare with the word. But note, if the secret word has two A's, and we guess one A in a wrong position, we might get a '-'.

 Since we don't have much information, we'll avoid double letters for now.

 Let's choose a word that has A in a different position, and includes other common letters.

 Possible candidates:
 - PLAID: P, L, A, I, D -> but we haven't tested P, L, I, D. And note, A is placed in position 3? That's the same position as before? We know A cannot be in position 3? Wait, no. The feedback says that in the first guess, the A in position 3 was present in the word but in the wrong position. That means the secret word does have an A, but not in position 3. So we can try A in other positions.

 But in PLAID, if we put A in position 4? Actually, the word PLAID has the letters: P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), D(5). So A is in position 3 again, which we know is incorrect? But wouldn't we get a '-' again for A if it was in position 3? Actually, we wouldn't want to put A in position 3 because we know that position is incorrect? Or does it mean that the A we guessed at position 3 is present elsewhere? Actually, the '-' means the letter A is in the word, but not at position 3. So we must avoid putting A at position 3? We can, but it will likely result in the same feedback for that position if the secret word doesn't have an A at position 3.

 Alternatively, we can try to put A in another position to see if we can locate it.

 A good approach is to put A in a position we haven't tested: position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Let's try position 1: words starting with A.

 Examples: 
 - ABOVE: has A(1), B, O, V, E -> but E is eliminated? Our feedback said E is eliminated (E:x). So we cannot use E. Also, V is not common.

 - ALONG: A(1), L, O, N, G. This avoids C, R, T, E. Uses O, L, N, G. We haven't tested these letters.

 - ALIGN: A(1), L, I, G, N.

 - APPLE: but we won't use because E is eliminated and has double P? Also, we have PP and E is eliminated.

 Since E is eliminated, we choose ALONG or ALIGN.

 Another option: put A in position 2.

 Words: SALON, BALMY, etc. But SALON: S, A, L, O, N -> avoids eliminated letters.

 Also, we can put A in position 4: e.g., with words like PLAZA? Not ideal because of double A and we don't know.

 Let's go with ALIGN: 
 - A at position 1: that's a new position.
 - Then we get to test L, I, G, N.

 But note: if the secret word does have A at position 1, then we'll get a '✓' for A. If not, we'll get a '-' if A is elsewhere? Or 'x' if not? We know A is present so it cannot be 'x'. So we'll either get ✓ or - for A.

 Alternatively, if we want more new information, we might avoid putting A at position 1 because it's a possibility. But testing A at a new position is good.

 Another common word: SAUNA? But double A and U.

 Let me pick a word that has A at a different position and uses new letters.

 Idea: SAILS? But that has S at the beginning. Also, we don't know about S. Or SOAPY? But O and Y.

 Considering avoiding eliminated letters and maximizing new letters, let's go with:

 Option: SALON (S, A, L, O, N) 
 - A is at position 2.

 Option: MANGO (M, A, N, G, O) 
 - A at position 2.

 However, M and G are new.

 But note: we also want to check if the word has other vowels. I and O are common.

 Let me choose ""ALIEN"". But E is eliminated? We cannot use E. So that's out.

 We need a word without C, R, T, E.

 Let's look for words that have A in either position 1, 2, 4 or 5 and without eliminated letters.

 After consideration, I think ""PIANO"" is a good candidate: 
 - P, I, A, N, O. 
 - A is at position 3? Oh no, we cannot put A at position 3 because we already know that position 3 is not A? But wait: 
   In ""PIANO"": positions: 1-P, 2-I, 3-A, 4-N, 5-O.

 We know from the first guess that A is not in position 3? Only that in the first guess, the A at position 3 was not correct because it was moved to another position? Actually, the feedback for the first guess: A in position 3 was marked ""-"", meaning it is not in that position. However, if we put A again in position 3, then:
   - If the secret word has A at position 3, then we would get a ""✓"", but we were told it's not at position 3? Actually, the first feedback tells us that the secret word does NOT have A at position 3? Correct.

 So in the second guess, if we put A at position 3 again, we know that the feedback for that position will be either:
   - If the secret word has A at position 3 (contradiction), then we get ✓? But wait, the first feedback said it's not at position 3, so it shouldn't be there.

 Therefore, putting A in position 3 in the second guess would be wasting that spot? We would know that it is incorrect? And we might get a '-' again? Actually, if we put A in position 3 again, and the secret word does have A elsewhere (but not at position 3), then we'll get a '-' again? Because the letter A is present but not at position 3. But that doesn't give us new information about the position of A.

 So it's better to avoid position 3 for A and try it in a new position.

 So I decide to avoid position 3.

 Final choice: let's try ""PIANA"" is not a word. How about ""PLAIN"": 
 - PLAIN: P(1), L(2), A(3) -> A at position 3? No, same issue.

 ""PANDA"": P(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), A(5) -> But A is in position 2 and 5? And position 3 is N. This has A at position 2 and 5? But let me check: it might be. But the word PANDA has two A's? Actually, the last letter is A? No, PANDA is P-A-N-D-A. So we are putting A in positions 2 and 5? Then the feedback might be: 
   Position 2: if the secret word has A at position 2, then ✓, otherwise if A is elsewhere we might get '-'? And position 5: similarly? But we don't know if the word has one A or two.

 Since we don't have much information about multiple letters, it's better to avoid double letters until we have more info.

 Let me choose a word with A at position 1: 
 - ALBUM: but B, U, M? But also U is a vowel? It's acceptable.

 But let me think of one that uses more common letters. 

 Suggested word: ""BASIC"". But note: 
   B A S I C: A at position2? And we see: 
   We'll have to avoid B, S, I, C? But C was eliminated? The first feedback: C was x, so it's eliminated. So ""BASIC"" has C? Which is eliminated. Cannot use.

 Alternative: ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A at position 2? 
   But D, I, L, Y are new.

 However, note: position 3 in the word DAILY is I? We don't know about that.

 Let me consider ""OASIS"": but O at the start? And then A at position 2? But it has two S's? Also, OASIS has S twice.

 Since we are limited, and I want to get a good sampling, I choose:

 Word: ""ADIEU"" -> but it has E? Oh, eliminated. So we cannot use E.

 Therefore, let's try ""MOVED""? but E and D? Eliminated? We don't know about D. But E is eliminated? So ""MOVED"" has E? No.

 After some thought, I'll go with ""SALAD"": 
   S, A (position2?), L, A, D -> A at positions 2 and 5? But we don't know if the word has multiple A's? 
   Also, we have L and D. And S and D.

 But SALAD is a valid word? But the first feedback did not have A twice? Actually, we don't know.

 Alternatively, choose a word without double letters: 
   ""HAPPY""? We can avoid? But has P repeated? Not good.

 So, let's pick ""ALIGN"": 
   Letters: A, L, I, G, N -> avoid eliminated C,R,T,E? Yes. 
   Positions: 
      1: A (test A at position1)
      2: L
      3: I
      4: G
      5: N

 We get to test L, I, G, N as well.

 So I'll go with ""ALIGN"".

 But note: if the secret word does not have A at position1, then we'll get '-' for A? But we already know the secret word has A? So we'll get '-' for A at position1 if it is in the word but not at that position? And if A is at position1, we'll get ✓.

 So we'll narrow down the position of A.

 Therefore, our next guess is ""ALIGN"".

 Let me summarize: 
   We are to avoid C, R, T, E? Yes.
   We are adding: A (again, but at a new position), L, I, G, N.

 So, we return: <guess>ALIGN</guess>

 But note: the word must be a valid English word, and ""ALIGN"" is valid.

 Done.
</think>
Based on the feedback from my first guess ""CRATE"":
- C, R, T, and E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- A is present but not in position 3 (marked as ""-"").

Key insights:
1. The secret word contains the letter A, positioned at 1, 2, 4, or 5.
2. My next guess must:
   - Include A in a position other than 3 (to test its location).
   - Avoid using C, R, T, E (eliminated letters).
   - Test new frequent letters like L, I, G, N, S to gather more information.

I chose ""ALIGN"":
- Tests A in position 1.
- Introduces new common letters: L (position 2), I (position 3), G (position 4), N (position 5).
- Avoids eliminated letters, maximizing new feedback potential.

<guess>ALIGN</guess>",ALIGN,"We have feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"": 
 C: x -> not in the secret word

Actually, the last letter is A? No, PANDA is P-A-N-D-A. So we are putting A in positions 2 and 5? Then the feedback might be: 
   Position 2: if the secret word has A at position 2, then ✓, otherwise if A is elsewhere we might get '-'? And position 5: similarly? But we don't know if the word has one A or two.

 Since we don't have much information about multiple letters, it's better to avoid double letters until we have more info.

 Let me choose a word with A at position 1: 
 - ALBUM: but B, U, M? But also U is a vowel? It's acceptable.

 But let me think of one that uses more common letters. 

 Suggested word: ""BASIC"". But note: 
   B A S I C: A at position2? And we see: 
   We'll have to avoid B, S, I, C? But C was eliminated? The first feedback: C was x, so it's eliminated. So ""BASIC"" has C? Which is eliminated. Cannot use.

 Alternative: ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A at position 2? 
   But D, I, L, Y are new.

 However, note: position 3 in the word DAILY is I? We don't know about that.

 Let me consider ""OASIS"": but O at the start? And then A at position 2? But it has two S's? Also, OASIS has S twice.

 Since we are limited, and I want to get a good sampling, I choose:

 Word: ""ADIEU"" -> but it has E? Oh, eliminated. So we cannot use E.

 Therefore, let's try ""MOVED""? but E and D? Eliminated? We don't know about D. But E is eliminated? So ""MOVED"" has E? No.

 After some thought, I'll go with ""SALAD"": 
   S, A (position2?), L, A, D -> A at positions 2 and 5? But we don't know if the word has multiple A's? 
   Also, we have L and D. And S and D.

 But SALAD is a valid word? But the first feedback did not have A twice? Actually, we don't know.

 Alternatively, choose a word without double letters: 
   ""HAPPY""? We can avoid? But has P repeated? Not good.

 So, let's pick ""ALIGN"": 
   Letters: A, L, I, G, N -> avoid eliminated C,R,T,E? Yes. 
   Positions: 
      1: A (test A at position1)
      2: L
      3: I
      4: G
      5: N

 We get to test L, I, G, N as well.

 So I'll go with ""ALIGN"".

 But note: if the secret word does not have A at position1, then we'll get '-' for A? But we already know the secret word has A? So we'll get '-' for A at position1 if it is in the word but not at that position? And if A is at position1, we'll get ✓.

 So we'll narrow down the position of A.

 Therefore, our next guess is ""ALIGN"".

 Let me summarize: 
   We are to avoid C, R, T, E? Yes.
   We are adding: A (again, but at a new position), L, I, G, N.

 So, we return: <guess>ALIGN</guess>

 But note: the word must be a valid English word, and ""ALIGN"" is valid.

 Done.Based on the feedback from my first guess ""CRATE"":
- C, R, T, and E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- A is present but not in position 3 (marked as ""-"").

Key insights:
1. The secret word contains the letter A, positioned at 1, 2, 4, or 5.
2. My next guess must:
   - Include A in a position other than 3 (to test its location).
   - Avoid using C, R, T, E (eliminated letters).
   - Test new frequent letters like L, I, G, N, S to gather more information.

I chose ""ALIGN"":
- Tests A in position 1.
- Introduces new common letters: L (position 2), I (position 3), G (position 4), N (position 5).
- Avoids eliminated letters, maximizing new feedback potential.",Guess 2: ALIGN -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(x) I(-) G(x) N(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,mafia,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We need to make the first guess.
 Since there is no prior feedback to rely on, we should choose a word that has a good distribution of common letters to maximize the information we get.

 Common starting words in games like Wordle often use words with common vowels and consonants. 
 For example, words like ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", or ""RAISE"" are popular.

 I'll choose ""CRATE"" because it has C, R, A, T, E: common consonants and two vowels (A and E).

 However, note that the feedback will be given for a 5-letter word. We'll receive feedback for each letter.

 So, my first guess is ""CRATE"".

<guess>CRATE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"": 
 C: x -> not in the secret word
 R: x -> not in the secret word
 A: - -> present in the secret word but not in the correct position
 T: x -> not in the secret word
 E: x -> not in the secret word

 What we know:
 - The letter A is in the word, but not as the third letter (since position 3 in our guess was A, but it got ""-"" meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, and it must be in one of these positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is incorrect). But note, the positions are 1-based: 
 Position 1: C (x)
 Position 2: R (x)
 Position 3: A (-) -> so A is elsewhere
 Position 4: T (x)
 Position 5: E (x)

 So, for our next guess, we need to use words that incorporate the letter A in positions that are not 3. Also, we must avoid C, R, T, E.

 Let's think of a word that has A, and uses other common letters to maximize new information.

 Common vowels: besides A, we have I, O, U. But note, we can also use consonants that haven't been eliminated.

 Eliminated letters: C, R, T, E.
 We should avoid these letters.

 We might want to use common letters like S, N, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

 Since A is misplaced from position 3, let's try putting A in different positions.

 Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

 One idea: try words with A in position 1? But we don't know if that's the case. We could also put it in position 4 or 5.

 But note: we have not tried many consonants yet. Let's pick a word that has A and other common letters.

 Some words to consider:
 - SALAD: has two A's? But we don't know if the word has multiple A's. But our feedback didn't indicate that A is repeated, but it doesn't rule it out either. However, from the feedback, we only know one A is present because only one was in the guess? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about multiple occurrences unless we have multiple in the guess. So ""SALAD"" uses S, A, L, D. But we haven't tested S, L, D.

 However, note that in ""CRATE"", the letter A was in the third position and we got a '-', meaning there's at least one A elsewhere. If the secret word had two A's and one was in position 3, then that A would have been marked as '-'? Actually, the feedback system: for each letter in the guess, we compare with the word. But note, if the secret word has two A's, and we guess one A in a wrong position, we might get a '-'.

 Since we don't have much information, we'll avoid double letters for now.

 Let's choose a word that has A in a different position, and includes other common letters.

 Possible candidates:
 - PLAID: P, L, A, I, D -> but we haven't tested P, L, I, D. And note, A is placed in position 3? That's the same position as before? We know A cannot be in position 3? Wait, no. The feedback says that in the first guess, the A in position 3 was present in the word but in the wrong position. That means the secret word does have an A, but not in position 3. So we can try A in other positions.

 But in PLAID, if we put A in position 4? Actually, the word PLAID has the letters: P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), D(5). So A is in position 3 again, which we know is incorrect? But wouldn't we get a '-' again for A if it was in position 3? Actually, we wouldn't want to put A in position 3 because we know that position is incorrect? Or does it mean that the A we guessed at position 3 is present elsewhere? Actually, the '-' means the letter A is in the word, but not at position 3. So we must avoid putting A at position 3? We can, but it will likely result in the same feedback for that position if the secret word doesn't have an A at position 3.

 Alternatively, we can try to put A in another position to see if we can locate it.

 A good approach is to put A in a position we haven't tested: position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Let's try position 1: words starting with A.

 Examples: 
 - ABOVE: has A(1), B, O, V, E -> but E is eliminated? Our feedback said E is eliminated (E:x). So we cannot use E. Also, V is not common.

 - ALONG: A(1), L, O, N, G. This avoids C, R, T, E. Uses O, L, N, G. We haven't tested these letters.

 - ALIGN: A(1), L, I, G, N.

 - APPLE: but we won't use because E is eliminated and has double P? Also, we have PP and E is eliminated.

 Since E is eliminated, we choose ALONG or ALIGN.

 Another option: put A in position 2.

 Words: SALON, BALMY, etc. But SALON: S, A, L, O, N -> avoids eliminated letters.

 Also, we can put A in position 4: e.g., with words like PLAZA? Not ideal because of double A and we don't know.

 Let's go with ALIGN: 
 - A at position 1: that's a new position.
 - Then we get to test L, I, G, N.

 But note: if the secret word does have A at position 1, then we'll get a '✓' for A. If not, we'll get a '-' if A is elsewhere? Or 'x' if not? We know A is present so it cannot be 'x'. So we'll either get ✓ or - for A.

 Alternatively, if we want more new information, we might avoid putting A at position 1 because it's a possibility. But testing A at a new position is good.

 Another common word: SAUNA? But double A and U.

 Let me pick a word that has A at a different position and uses new letters.

 Idea: SAILS? But that has S at the beginning. Also, we don't know about S. Or SOAPY? But O and Y.

 Considering avoiding eliminated letters and maximizing new letters, let's go with:

 Option: SALON (S, A, L, O, N) 
 - A is at position 2.

 Option: MANGO (M, A, N, G, O) 
 - A at position 2.

 However, M and G are new.

 But note: we also want to check if the word has other vowels. I and O are common.

 Let me choose ""ALIEN"". But E is eliminated? We cannot use E. So that's out.

 We need a word without C, R, T, E.

 Let's look for words that have A in either position 1, 2, 4 or 5 and without eliminated letters.

 After consideration, I think ""PIANO"" is a good candidate: 
 - P, I, A, N, O. 
 - A is at position 3? Oh no, we cannot put A at position 3 because we already know that position 3 is not A? But wait: 
   In ""PIANO"": positions: 1-P, 2-I, 3-A, 4-N, 5-O.

 We know from the first guess that A is not in position 3? Only that in the first guess, the A at position 3 was not correct because it was moved to another position? Actually, the feedback for the first guess: A in position 3 was marked ""-"", meaning it is not in that position. However, if we put A again in position 3, then:
   - If the secret word has A at position 3, then we would get a ""✓"", but we were told it's not at position 3? Actually, the first feedback tells us that the secret word does NOT have A at position 3? Correct.

 So in the second guess, if we put A at position 3 again, we know that the feedback for that position will be either:
   - If the secret word has A at position 3 (contradiction), then we get ✓? But wait, the first feedback said it's not at position 3, so it shouldn't be there.

 Therefore, putting A in position 3 in the second guess would be wasting that spot? We would know that it is incorrect? And we might get a '-' again? Actually, if we put A in position 3 again, and the secret word does have A elsewhere (but not at position 3), then we'll get a '-' again? Because the letter A is present but not at position 3. But that doesn't give us new information about the position of A.

 So it's better to avoid position 3 for A and try it in a new position.

 So I decide to avoid position 3.

 Final choice: let's try ""PIANA"" is not a word. How about ""PLAIN"": 
 - PLAIN: P(1), L(2), A(3) -> A at position 3? No, same issue.

 ""PANDA"": P(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), A(5) -> But A is in position 2 and 5? And position 3 is N. This has A at position 2 and 5? But let me check: it might be. But the word PANDA has two A's? Actually, the last letter is A? No, PANDA is P-A-N-D-A. So we are putting A in positions 2 and 5? Then the feedback might be: 
   Position 2: if the secret word has A at position 2, then ✓, otherwise if A is elsewhere we might get '-'? And position 5: similarly? But we don't know if the word has one A or two.

 Since we don't have much information about multiple letters, it's better to avoid double letters until we have more info.

 Let me choose a word with A at position 1: 
 - ALBUM: but B, U, M? But also U is a vowel? It's acceptable.

 But let me think of one that uses more common letters. 

 Suggested word: ""BASIC"". But note: 
   B A S I C: A at position2? And we see: 
   We'll have to avoid B, S, I, C? But C was eliminated? The first feedback: C was x, so it's eliminated. So ""BASIC"" has C? Which is eliminated. Cannot use.

 Alternative: ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A at position 2? 
   But D, I, L, Y are new.

 However, note: position 3 in the word DAILY is I? We don't know about that.

 Let me consider ""OASIS"": but O at the start? And then A at position 2? But it has two S's? Also, OASIS has S twice.

 Since we are limited, and I want to get a good sampling, I choose:

 Word: ""ADIEU"" -> but it has E? Oh, eliminated. So we cannot use E.

 Therefore, let's try ""MOVED""? but E and D? Eliminated? We don't know about D. But E is eliminated? So ""MOVED"" has E? No.

 After some thought, I'll go with ""SALAD"": 
   S, A (position2?), L, A, D -> A at positions 2 and 5? But we don't know if the word has multiple A's? 
   Also, we have L and D. And S and D.

 But SALAD is a valid word? But the first feedback did not have A twice? Actually, we don't know.

 Alternatively, choose a word without double letters: 
   ""HAPPY""? We can avoid? But has P repeated? Not good.

 So, let's pick ""ALIGN"": 
   Letters: A, L, I, G, N -> avoid eliminated C,R,T,E? Yes. 
   Positions: 
      1: A (test A at position1)
      2: L
      3: I
      4: G
      5: N

 We get to test L, I, G, N as well.

 So I'll go with ""ALIGN"".

 But note: if the secret word does not have A at position1, then we'll get '-' for A? But we already know the secret word has A? So we'll get '-' for A at position1 if it is in the word but not at that position? And if A is at position1, we'll get ✓.

 So we'll narrow down the position of A.

 Therefore, our next guess is ""ALIGN"".

 Let me summarize: 
   We are to avoid C, R, T, E? Yes.
   We are adding: A (again, but at a new position), L, I, G, N.

 So, we return: <guess>ALIGN</guess>

 But note: the word must be a valid English word, and ""ALIGN"" is valid.

 Done.Based on the feedback from my first guess ""CRATE"":

- A is present but not in position 3 (marked as ""-"").

Correct.\n\n So in the second guess, if we put A at position 3 again, we know that the feedback for that position will be either:\n   - If the secret word has A at position 3 (contradiction), then we get ✓? But wait, the first feedback said it\'s not at position 3, so it shouldn\'t be there.\n\n Therefore, putting A in position 3 in the second guess would be wasting that spot? We would know that it is incorrect? And we might get a \'-\' again? Actually, if we put A in position 3 again, and the secret word does have A elsewhere (but not at position 3), then we\'ll get a \'-\' again? Because the letter A is present but not at position 3. But that doesn\'t give us new information about the position of A.\n\n So it\'s better to avoid position 3 for A and try it in a new position.\n\n So I decide to avoid position 3.\n\n Final choice: let\'s try ""PIANA"" is not a word. How about ""PLAIN"": \n - PLAIN: P(1), L(2), A(3) -> A at position 3? No, same issue.\n\n ""PANDA"": P(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), A(5) -> But A is in position 2 and 5? And position 3 is N. This has A at position 2 and 5? But let me check: it might be. But the word PANDA has two A\'s? Actually, the last letter is A? No, PANDA is P-A-N-D-A. So we are putting A in positions 2 and 5? Then the feedback might be: \n   Position 2: if the secret word has A at position 2, then ✓, otherwise if A is elsewhere we might get \'-\'? And position 5: similarly? But we don\'t know if the word has one A or two.\n\n Since we don\'t have much information about multiple letters, it\'s better to avoid double letters until we have more info.\n\n Let me choose a word with A at position 1: \n - ALBUM: but B, U, M? But also U is a vowel? It\'s acceptable.\n\n But let me think of one that uses more common letters. \n\n Suggested word: ""BASIC"". But note: \n   B A S I C: A at position2? And we see: \n   We\'ll have to avoid B, S, I, C? But C was eliminated? The first feedback: C was x, so it\'s eliminated. So ""BASIC"" has C? Which is eliminated. Cannot use.\n\n Alternative: ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A at position 2? \n   But D, I, L, Y are new.\n\n However, note: position 3 in the word DAILY is I? We don\'t know about that.\n\n Let me consider ""OASIS"": but O at the start? And then A at position 2? But it has two S\'s? Also, OASIS has S twice.\n\n Since we are limited, and I want to get a good sampling, I choose:\n\n Word: ""ADIEU"" -> but it has E? Oh, eliminated. So we cannot use E.\n\n Therefore, let\'s try ""MOVED""? but E and D? Eliminated? We don\'t know about D. But E is eliminated? So ""MOVED"" has E? No.\n\n After some thought, I\'ll go with ""SALAD"": \n   S, A (position2?), L, A, D -> A at positions 2 and 5? But we don\'t know if the word has multiple A\'s? \n   Also, we have L and D. And S and D.\n\n But SALAD is a valid word? But the first feedback did not have A twice? Actually, we don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, choose a word without double letters: \n   ""HAPPY""? We can avoid? But has P repeated? Not good.\n\n So, let\'s pick ""ALIGN"": \n   Letters: A, L, I, G, N -> avoid eliminated C,R,T,E? Yes. \n   Positions: \n      1: A (test A at position1)\n      2: L\n      3: I\n      4: G\n      5: N\n\n We get to test L, I, G, N as well.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""ALIGN"".\n\n But note: if the secret word does not have A at position1, then we\'ll get \'-\' for A? But we already know the secret word has A? So we\'ll get \'-\' for A at position1 if it is in the word but not at that position? And if A is at position1, we\'ll get ✓.\n\n So we\'ll narrow down the position of A.\n\n Therefore, our next guess is ""ALIGN"".\n\n Let me summarize: \n   We are to avoid C, R, T, E? Yes.\n   We are adding: A (again, but at a new position), L, I, G, N.\n\n So, we return: <guess>ALIGN</guess>\n\n But note: the word must be a valid English word, and ""ALIGN"" is valid.\n\n Done.Based on the feedback from my first guess ""CRATE"":\n- C, R, T, and E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").\n- A is present but not in position 3 (marked as ""-"").\n\nKey insights:\n1. The secret word contains the letter A, positioned at 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n2. My next guess must:\n   - Include A in a position other than 3 (to test its location).\n   - Avoid using C, R, T, E (eliminated letters).\n   - Test new frequent letters like L, I, G, N, S to gather more information.\n\nI chose ""ALIGN"":\n- Tests A in position 1.\n- Introduces new common letters: L (position 2), I (position 3), G (position 4), N (position 5).\n- Avoids eliminated letters, maximizing new feedback potential.\n\n<guess>ALIGN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ALIGN -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(x) I(-) G(x) N(x)\n'}]","<think>
Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:

From Guess 1 (CRATE):
- C(x), R(x), T(x), E(x): These letters are not in the secret word.
- A(-): The letter A is in the word but not in position 3.

From Guess 2 (ALIGN):
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1 (since we guessed A at position 1 and got ""-"").
- L(x): L is not in the word.
- I(-): I is in the word but not in position 3.
- G(x): G is not in the word.
- N(x): N is not in the word.

We now know:
1. The secret word contains A and I.
2. A is not in position 1 or 3 (from guesses 1 and 2).
3. I is not in position 3 (from guess 2).
4. The following letters are eliminated: C, R, T, E, L, G, N. These are not in the word.

Possible positions for A: Since A is not in position 3 (from guess 1) and not in position 1 (from guess 2), it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

Similarly, I is in the word but not in position 3, so I can be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We have two confirmed letters: A and I. We need to find three more letters, avoiding the eliminated ones.

Eliminated letters so far: C, R, T, E, L, G, N.

Common letters not yet tested: B, D, F, H, K, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We must construct a new word that:
- Includes A (in position 2, 4, or 5) and I (in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, but not 3).
- Avoids eliminated letters: C,R,T,E,L,G,N.
- Tests new letters to get more information.

Since we have limited spots (only positions 2,4,5 for A, and only positions 1,2,4,5 for I, avoiding position 3 which is where both are misplaced), we can try to pin down A's position.

Try to put A in position 2: Then we can have I in a position other than 2, so 1,4,5.

Similarly, if A is in position 4, I can be in 1,2,5, etc.

To test multiple possibilities, we can construct a word that places A in one of the possible positions (say position 2) and I in another position.

Example words:
- Consider putting A at position 2: words like _ A _ _ _
- And I at position 5: so _ A _ _ I

But we need a valid English word in between.

Possible word: ""HAVAI""? Not English.
- ""BASIS""? But B and S; but S is new. But note: we have eliminated R, so S is okay? Also, BASIS has S twice? But BASIP is not a word.

Alternative: put A at position 4 and I at position 1: I _ _ A _
Example word: ""INPUT""? But N is eliminated? Yes, we got N(x) in guess 2. And P,U,T: T is eliminated? Yes, T is eliminated from guess 1. So INPUT is invalid because of T and N.

Another idea: ""DAISY"" – but D, A, I, S, Y.
Positions: D(1), A(2), I(3), but I at position 3? But from guess 2, we know I is not in position 3? Or are we allowed to guess I again at position 3? We know from the feedback of guess 2 that I is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put I at position 3 again, it will still be ""-"" (if I is elsewhere) or maybe force a higher penalty? Actually, it's allowed, but we won't learn new info because we already know the secret word has I but not at position 3? So putting I at position 3 again will almost certainly get a ""-"", which wastes a chance.

So it's better to avoid position 3 for I and A? Actually, A is already avoided? We cannot put A at position 3? That has been tried. Similarly, we should not put I at position 3 again because we know it's not there.

Therefore, we need to pick a word that avoids position 3 for both A and I? Actually, we need to skip position 3? Or we can put a new letter at position 3.

So let's think of a word without letters at the known incorrect positions for A and I? And avoiding eliminated letters.

Assume we try A at position 2 and I at position 1: I A _ _ _

But what? IAMBS? Not English.

Put A at position 2 and I at position 4: _ A I _ _

Valid words: BAILS? But B, A, I, L? L is eliminated? L(x) from guess 2? So L is eliminated? Cannot use.

Similarly, RAINY? R is eliminated? Not possible.

Put A at position 2 and I at position 5: _ A _ _ I

Words: happy, but has Y? And P is common? But not 5-letter: HAPPY? But double P? Also, letters: H, A, P, P, I? Doesn't fit pattern.

Valid words: ""MASSAI""? Not English? Generally, let's think of common letters: S, O, M, P, D, H, B, F, K?

Word: ""BASIN"" -> B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), (no fifth? No? basin is 5 letters? B-A-S-I-N? But N is eliminated? So cannot use.

""BASIN"" has N? We cannot use N.

Another: ""CAPSI"" - C is eliminated? Not possible.

So position 2 for A may be difficult? Try A at position 4.

Put A at position 4: _ _ _ A _
But we also have I to place, say at position 1: I _ _ A _

Words: INFRA? But R and N are eliminated? Not.
IDOLA? But O, L? L is eliminated?

No: I D O L A? That's 6 letters? IDOLA is 5? I-D-O-L-A? But L is eliminated? Cannot.

Put I at position 5: _ _ _ A I

Words: OASIS? O(1), A(2), S(3), I? Positions? To have A at position 4 and I at position 5, we need a pattern: _ _ _ A I? Example: ""PUP AI"" Not. ""BOM AI"" Not.

Valid English word? ""KAPOI""? Not common.

Known word: ""TAPIR"" – T-A-P-I-R? But T is eliminated? Cannot.

This is difficult? Maybe A at position 5.

Put A at position 5: _ _ _ _ A
And I at position 1: I _ _ _ A

Words: ""INDIA""? But N and D? N is eliminated? And I at two positions? I at 1 and 4? Doesn't matter? But INDIA: I(1),N(2),D(3),I(4),A(5)? But N is eliminated, so no.

Similarly, ""IDYLL"" – L eliminated.

I think we need to be flexible? Perhaps put I and A but not restricting to specific positions without conflicts? Or choose a word that has A in one of the possible positions and I in one? But avoid overlaps? Also remember position 3 must be tested? Currently position 3 is open.

But we have two letters to place: A and I, and we know they are in the word? So any guess must include both? Unless there are multiple of them, but we don't know? We only have one each known.

Since we know A and I are present, we must include them? Yes.

But the positions are not fixed.

Alternatively, put A at position 4 and I at position 2: _ I _ A _

Words: VIMAN? Not. WIDIA? Not.

Common words: DIVAN? D-I-V-A-N? But N eliminated? Cannot.

FJORD? But R and D? R eliminated then? D is acceptable? No R? Wait: FJORD: F J O R D? R eliminated? So if we avoid R? But R is eliminated.

R is from guess 1? Yes.

So D is viable? But F J O R D: R exists? So cannot use.

Another: ""PIANO"" – P-I-A-N-O? But N is eliminated? Cannot use.

""BASIA""? Not word? OR ""MAMA"" with I? Not.

This is challenging.

Perhaps put the less common positions? Position 2 for A? But with H, S?

Example: placing A at position 5? Words ending with A: and I at position 1? Like in IRAQI? But Q,I? Letters: I, R, A, Q? But R eliminated? Not.

""PAISA""? P-A-I-S-A? But A is at position 2 and 5? That could work? But S is new.

P-A-I-S-A: positions: P(1), A(2), I(3), S(4), A(5)? I at position 3? But we have already established that I is not in position 3? From guess 2? So putting I at position 3 would be a bad move? Because we know it is not there? So we would expect a ""-"" for that I? And for the first A? At position 2: it might be correct or not? And position 5A: might be correct or wrong? But we know there is at least one A.

But feedback doesn't differentiate between duplicate letters clearly? If we have two A's, and the secret word has one? Then one A might get a ""-"" and another might get an ""x"" if not present? But we know A is present at least once? So at least one A will not be ""x"".

But in ""PAISA"", A is at 2 and 5? And I at 3? That could be a waste.

Another idea: put A at position 2 and avoid I at position 3: so have I at position 4? Then _ A _ I _ 

Example: ""BAS IS"" Not? Words like ""RABID""? But R and B eliminated? R out? R is out.

Or ""HABIT"": H(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), T(5)? But T is eliminated? Cannot use T.

""FAVOR"" - R out? Eliminated? F A V O R? R in it? No.

Look for another? ""SAUDI"": S(1), A(2), U(3), D(4), I(5)? Positions: A at 2, I at 5. And U at 3? This seems possible. Letters: S, A, U, D, I? Eliminated? Check: C,R,T,E,L,G,N are eliminated? Yes, no overlap.

So ""SAUDI"" is valid? And it tests S, U, D.

Alternatively, you could have ""DAISY""? But only if D A I S Y? But I at position 3? we know I is not in position 3? Actually, D(1), A(2), I(3), S(4), Y(5)? If we put I at 3, we know that will be '-', so we lose that chance? Better to avoid.

In ""SAUDI"": the positions are:
Position 1: S
Position 2: A
Position 3: U
Position 4: D
Position 5: I

We are testing A at position 2: if A is really at pos2, we get ✓? Else if it's elsewhere? Then '-'? Similarly, test I at position 5: if it's at 5? ✓? Else '-'. Also, S at1, U at3, D at4.

So this tests multiple new letters: S, U, D? And also confirms A and I positions? or not.

But we don't have many options? And SAUDI is a valid word.

Another word: ""SAPI"" with O? ""SAPID""? But P? and D.

""SAPID"": S(1), A(2), P(3), I(4), D(5)? Which A at 2 and I at 4? And no position 3 conflicts? But we could do that? SAPID is a word? Yes.

Compare SAUDI and SAPID:
- SAUDI tests U at position 3? And S at1, A at2, D at4, I at5.
- SAPID tests P at position 3? And S at1, A at2, I at4, D at5.

Both are good? But perhaps SAPID is less common? They are both valid.

We can use SAUDI because it has U? Which is less common? But we want to test more common letters? Like S, P, U, D.

I think S is more common, so test S and U? Or test P and D? Both can be.

But to decide, I'll pick SAUDI? Or maybe swap to avoid rare? Consider feedback potential? 

Important: We cannot use SAPID? Because if we put I at position 4, but I is already known to be present? So testing I at position 4 could be good.

Same as SAUDI places I at position 5? Which are both new positions.

So, both are acceptable? Let me choose SAUDI.

But SAUDI has U? Which may be less common? We might get more information from S and D?

Alternatively, another word: ""BACHS"" not? Or ""BAIKS"" not.

So I think SAUDI is reasonable.

But let's double-check if there are better choices? 

Another word: ""OASTS"" double S? Not ideal.

""PASTA""? P A S T A? But T is eliminated? Cannot.

So SAUDI, SAPID both feasible? But I pick SAUDI because it uses common letters? Or SAPID uses P? P is common.

But both S and P are common? So probably similar.

But we also need to avoid position 3 for the confirmed letters? Actually, in SAUDI:
- A is at position 2: if the secret word has A at 2, then ✓? Else '-'? We rule out position 1? Because already got '-', and position 3 eliminated? So only positions 2,4,5? So we test position 2 here.
- I is at position 5: testing for position 5? If not, then it can be at position 4? Because we know not at position 3? And position 1 we haven't tested? But position 1: S is at position 1? That's a new letter.

Actually, SAUDI does not test I at position 1? Which has not been tested? But we can test it later.

Alternatively, if we want to test I at position 1, we can make a word like I _ _ _ A

But earlier we had no good words? So perhaps SAUDI is practical.

We'll go with SAUDI.

Therefore, guess ""SAUDI"".

Feedback will tell us if A is in position 2 or not? And I in position 5 or not.

Also, test S at position 1? U at position 3? D at position4.

So, new guess: SAUDI
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **CRATE** (Guess 1): Eliminated letters C, R, T, E (all ""x""). A is present but not in position 3 (""-"").
- **ALIGN** (Guess 2): Eliminated letters L, G, N (all ""x""). A is present but not in position 1 (""-""). I is present but not in position 3 (""-""), confirming A and I are in the word but must be in new positions.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters in secret word**: A and I.
- **A is not in positions 1 or 3**: Must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- **I is not in position 3**: Must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, T, E (from Guess 1) and L, G, N (from Guess 2). Avoid using these.
- **Strategy**:
  - Test A and I in new positions to pinpoint their locations.
  - Prioritize common untested letters like S, D, U, P, B, H, K, M, O to maximize information.
  - Avoid position 3 for A and I (already known incorrect).
- **Selected Guess ""SAUDI""**:
  - **S (position 1)**: Tests a new common letter at start.
  - **A (position 2)**: Tests if A is in position 2 (✓ or -). If not, A must be in 4 or 5.
- **U (position 3)**: Tests a new vowel in a previously unexplored position.
- **D (position 4)**: Tests a common consonant.
  - **I (position 5)**: Tests if I is in position 5 (✓ or -). If not, I must be in 1, 2, or 4.  
This guess efficiently tests A and I in unconfirmed positions while introducing three new letters (S, U, D) and avoiding eliminated letters.

Example: placing A at position 5? Words ending with A: and I at position 1? Like in IRAQI? But Q,I? Letters: I, R, A, Q? But R eliminated? Not.

""PAISA""? P-A-I-S-A? But A is at position 2 and 5? That could work? But S is new.

P-A-I-S-A: positions: P(1), A(2), I(3), S(4), A(5)? I at position 3? But we have already established that I is not in position 3? From guess 2? So putting I at position 3 would be a bad move? Because we know it is not there? So we would expect a ""-"" for that I? And for the first A? At position 2: it might be correct or not? And position 5A: might be correct or wrong? But we know there is at least one A.

But feedback doesn't differentiate between duplicate letters clearly? If we have two A's, and the secret word has one? Then one A might get a ""-"" and another might get an ""x"" if not present? But we know A is present at least once? So at least one A will not be ""x"".

But in ""PAISA"", A is at 2 and 5? And I at 3? That could be a waste.

Another idea: put A at position 2 and avoid I at position 3: so have I at position 4? Then _ A _ I _ 

Example: ""BAS IS"" Not? Words like ""RABID""? But R and B eliminated? R out? R is out.

Or ""HABIT"": H(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), T(5)? But T is eliminated? Cannot use T.

""FAVOR"" - R out? Eliminated? F A V O R? R in it? No.

Look for another? ""SAUDI"": S(1), A(2), U(3), D(4), I(5)? Positions: A at 2, I at 5. And U at 3? This seems possible. Letters: S, A, U, D, I? Eliminated? Check: C,R,T,E,L,G,N are eliminated? Yes, no overlap.

So ""SAUDI"" is valid? And it tests S, U, D.

Alternatively, you could have ""DAISY""? But only if D A I S Y? But I at position 3? we know I is not in position 3? Actually, D(1), A(2), I(3), S(4), Y(5)? If we put I at 3, we know that will be '-', so we lose that chance? Better to avoid.

In ""SAUDI"": the positions are:
Position 1: S
Position 2: A
Position 3: U
Position 4: D
Position 5: I

We are testing A at position 2: if A is really at pos2, we get ✓? Else if it's elsewhere? Then '-'? Similarly, test I at position 5: if it's at 5? ✓? Else '-'. Also, S at1, U at3, D at4.

So this tests multiple new letters: S, U, D? And also confirms A and I positions? or not.

But we don't have many options? And SAUDI is a valid word.

Another word: ""SAPI"" with O? ""SAPID""? But P? and D.

""SAPID"": S(1), A(2), P(3), I(4), D(5)? Which A at 2 and I at 4? And no position 3 conflicts? But we could do that? SAPID is a word? Yes.

Compare SAUDI and SAPID:
- SAUDI tests U at position 3? And S at1, A at2, D at4, I at5.
- SAPID tests P at position 3? And S at1, A at2, I at4, D at5.

Both are good? But perhaps SAPID is less common? They are both valid.

We can use SAUDI because it has U? Which is less common? But we want to test more common letters? Like S, P, U, D.

I think S is more common, so test S and U? Or test P and D? Both can be.

But to decide, I'll pick SAUDI? Or maybe swap to avoid rare? Consider feedback potential? 

Important: We cannot use SAPID? Because if we put I at position 4, but I is already known to be present? So testing I at position 4 could be good.

Same as SAUDI places I at position 5? Which are both new positions.

So, both are acceptable? Let me choose SAUDI.

But SAUDI has U? Which may be less common? We might get more information from S and D?

Alternatively, another word: ""BACHS"" not? Or ""BAIKS"" not.

So I think SAUDI is reasonable.

But let's double-check if there are better choices? 

Another word: ""OASTS"" double S? Not ideal.

""PASTA""? P A S T A? But T is eliminated? Cannot.

So SAUDI, SAPID both feasible? But I pick SAUDI because it uses common letters? Or SAPID uses P? P is common.

But both S and P are common? So probably similar.

But we also need to avoid position 3 for the confirmed letters? Actually, in SAUDI:
- A is at position 2: if the secret word has A at 2, then ✓? Else '-'? We rule out position 1? Because already got '-', and position 3 eliminated? So only positions 2,4,5? So we test position 2 here.
- I is at position 5: testing for position 5? If not, then it can be at position 4? Because we know not at position 3? And position 1 we haven't tested? But position 1: S is at position 1? That's a new letter.

Actually, SAUDI does not test I at position 1? Which has not been tested? But we can test it later.

Alternatively, if we want to test I at position 1, we can make a word like I _ _ _ A

But earlier we had no good words? So perhaps SAUDI is practical.

We'll go with SAUDI.

Therefore, guess ""SAUDI"".

Feedback will tell us if A is in position 2 or not? And I in position 5 or not.

Also, test S at position 1? U at position 3? D at position4.

So, new guess: SAUDIBased on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **CRATE** (Guess 1): Eliminated letters C, R, T, E (all ""x""). A is present but not in position 3 (""-"").
- **ALIGN** (Guess 2): Eliminated letters L, G, N (all ""x""). A is present but not in position 1 (""-""). I is present but not in position 3 (""-""), confirming A and I are in the word but must be in new positions.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters in secret word**: A and I.
- **A is not in positions 1 or 3**: Must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- **I is not in position 3**: Must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, T, E (from Guess 1) and L, G, N (from Guess 2). Avoid using these.
- **Strategy**:
  - Test A and I in new positions to pinpoint their locations.
  - Prioritize common untested letters like S, D, U, P, B, H, K, M, O to maximize information.
  - Avoid position 3 for A and I (already known incorrect).
- **Selected Guess ""SAUDI""**:
  - **S (position 1)**: Tests a new common letter at start.
  - **A (position 2)**: Tests if A is in position 2 (✓ or -). If not, A must be in 4 or 5.
- **U (position 3)**: Tests a new vowel in a previously unexplored position.
- **D (position 4)**: Tests a common consonant.
  - **I (position 5)**: Tests if I is in position 5 (✓ or -). If not, I must be in 1, 2, or 4.  
This guess efficiently tests A and I in unconfirmed positions while introducing three new letters (S, U, D) and avoiding eliminated letters.",Guess 3: SAUDI -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,mafia,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We need to make the first guess.
 Since there is no prior feedback to rely on, we should choose a word that has a good distribution of common letters to maximize the information we get.

 Common starting words in games like Wordle often use words with common vowels and consonants. 
 For example, words like ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", or ""RAISE"" are popular.

 I'll choose ""CRATE"" because it has C, R, A, T, E: common consonants and two vowels (A and E).

 However, note that the feedback will be given for a 5-letter word. We'll receive feedback for each letter.

 So, my first guess is ""CRATE"".

<guess>CRATE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"": 
 C: x -> not in the secret word
 R: x -> not in the secret word
 A: - -> present in the secret word but not in the correct position
 T: x -> not in the secret word
 E: x -> not in the secret word

 What we know:
 - The letter A is in the word, but not as the third letter (since position 3 in our guess was A, but it got ""-"" meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, and it must be in one of these positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is incorrect). But note, the positions are 1-based: 
 Position 1: C (x)
 Position 2: R (x)
 Position 3: A (-) -> so A is elsewhere
 Position 4: T (x)
 Position 5: E (x)

 So, for our next guess, we need to use words that incorporate the letter A in positions that are not 3. Also, we must avoid C, R, T, E.

 Let's think of a word that has A, and uses other common letters to maximize new information.

 Common vowels: besides A, we have I, O, U. But note, we can also use consonants that haven't been eliminated.

 Eliminated letters: C, R, T, E.
 We should avoid these letters.

 We might want to use common letters like S, N, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

 Since A is misplaced from position 3, let's try putting A in different positions.

 Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

 One idea: try words with A in position 1? But we don't know if that's the case. We could also put it in position 4 or 5.

 But note: we have not tried many consonants yet. Let's pick a word that has A and other common letters.

 Some words to consider:
 - SALAD: has two A's? But we don't know if the word has multiple A's. But our feedback didn't indicate that A is repeated, but it doesn't rule it out either. However, from the feedback, we only know one A is present because only one was in the guess? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about multiple occurrences unless we have multiple in the guess. So ""SALAD"" uses S, A, L, D. But we haven't tested S, L, D.

 However, note that in ""CRATE"", the letter A was in the third position and we got a '-', meaning there's at least one A elsewhere. If the secret word had two A's and one was in position 3, then that A would have been marked as '-'? Actually, the feedback system: for each letter in the guess, we compare with the word. But note, if the secret word has two A's, and we guess one A in a wrong position, we might get a '-'.

 Since we don't have much information, we'll avoid double letters for now.

 Let's choose a word that has A in a different position, and includes other common letters.

 Possible candidates:
 - PLAID: P, L, A, I, D -> but we haven't tested P, L, I, D. And note, A is placed in position 3? That's the same position as before? We know A cannot be in position 3? Wait, no. The feedback says that in the first guess, the A in position 3 was present in the word but in the wrong position. That means the secret word does have an A, but not in position 3. So we can try A in other positions.

 But in PLAID, if we put A in position 4? Actually, the word PLAID has the letters: P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), D(5). So A is in position 3 again, which we know is incorrect? But wouldn't we get a '-' again for A if it was in position 3? Actually, we wouldn't want to put A in position 3 because we know that position is incorrect? Or does it mean that the A we guessed at position 3 is present elsewhere? Actually, the '-' means the letter A is in the word, but not at position 3. So we must avoid putting A at position 3? We can, but it will likely result in the same feedback for that position if the secret word doesn't have an A at position 3.

 Alternatively, we can try to put A in another position to see if we can locate it.

 A good approach is to put A in a position we haven't tested: position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Let's try position 1: words starting with A.

 Examples: 
 - ABOVE: has A(1), B, O, V, E -> but E is eliminated? Our feedback said E is eliminated (E:x). So we cannot use E. Also, V is not common.

 - ALONG: A(1), L, O, N, G. This avoids C, R, T, E. Uses O, L, N, G. We haven't tested these letters.

 - ALIGN: A(1), L, I, G, N.

 - APPLE: but we won't use because E is eliminated and has double P? Also, we have PP and E is eliminated.

 Since E is eliminated, we choose ALONG or ALIGN.

 Another option: put A in position 2.

 Words: SALON, BALMY, etc. But SALON: S, A, L, O, N -> avoids eliminated letters.

 Also, we can put A in position 4: e.g., with words like PLAZA? Not ideal because of double A and we don't know.

 Let's go with ALIGN: 
 - A at position 1: that's a new position.
 - Then we get to test L, I, G, N.

 But note: if the secret word does have A at position 1, then we'll get a '✓' for A. If not, we'll get a '-' if A is elsewhere? Or 'x' if not? We know A is present so it cannot be 'x'. So we'll either get ✓ or - for A.

 Alternatively, if we want more new information, we might avoid putting A at position 1 because it's a possibility. But testing A at a new position is good.

 Another common word: SAUNA? But double A and U.

 Let me pick a word that has A at a different position and uses new letters.

 Idea: SAILS? But that has S at the beginning. Also, we don't know about S. Or SOAPY? But O and Y.

 Considering avoiding eliminated letters and maximizing new letters, let's go with:

 Option: SALON (S, A, L, O, N) 
 - A is at position 2.

 Option: MANGO (M, A, N, G, O) 
 - A at position 2.

 However, M and G are new.

 But note: we also want to check if the word has other vowels. I and O are common.

 Let me choose ""ALIEN"". But E is eliminated? We cannot use E. So that's out.

 We need a word without C, R, T, E.

 Let's look for words that have A in either position 1, 2, 4 or 5 and without eliminated letters.

 After consideration, I think ""PIANO"" is a good candidate: 
 - P, I, A, N, O. 
 - A is at position 3? Oh no, we cannot put A at position 3 because we already know that position 3 is not A? But wait: 
   In ""PIANO"": positions: 1-P, 2-I, 3-A, 4-N, 5-O.

 We know from the first guess that A is not in position 3? Only that in the first guess, the A at position 3 was not correct because it was moved to another position? Actually, the feedback for the first guess: A in position 3 was marked ""-"", meaning it is not in that position. However, if we put A again in position 3, then:
   - If the secret word has A at position 3, then we would get a ""✓"", but we were told it's not at position 3? Actually, the first feedback tells us that the secret word does NOT have A at position 3? Correct.

 So in the second guess, if we put A at position 3 again, we know that the feedback for that position will be either:
   - If the secret word has A at position 3 (contradiction), then we get ✓? But wait, the first feedback said it's not at position 3, so it shouldn't be there.

 Therefore, putting A in position 3 in the second guess would be wasting that spot? We would know that it is incorrect? And we might get a '-' again? Actually, if we put A in position 3 again, and the secret word does have A elsewhere (but not at position 3), then we'll get a '-' again? Because the letter A is present but not at position 3. But that doesn't give us new information about the position of A.

 So it's better to avoid position 3 for A and try it in a new position.

 So I decide to avoid position 3.

 Final choice: let's try ""PIANA"" is not a word. How about ""PLAIN"": 
 - PLAIN: P(1), L(2), A(3) -> A at position 3? No, same issue.

 ""PANDA"": P(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), A(5) -> But A is in position 2 and 5? And position 3 is N. This has A at position 2 and 5? But let me check: it might be. But the word PANDA has two A's? Actually, the last letter is A? No, PANDA is P-A-N-D-A. So we are putting A in positions 2 and 5? Then the feedback might be: 
   Position 2: if the secret word has A at position 2, then ✓, otherwise if A is elsewhere we might get '-'? And position 5: similarly? But we don't know if the word has one A or two.

 Since we don't have much information about multiple letters, it's better to avoid double letters until we have more info.

 Let me choose a word with A at position 1: 
 - ALBUM: but B, U, M? But also U is a vowel? It's acceptable.

 But let me think of one that uses more common letters. 

 Suggested word: ""BASIC"". But note: 
   B A S I C: A at position2? And we see: 
   We'll have to avoid B, S, I, C? But C was eliminated? The first feedback: C was x, so it's eliminated. So ""BASIC"" has C? Which is eliminated. Cannot use.

 Alternative: ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A at position 2? 
   But D, I, L, Y are new.

 However, note: position 3 in the word DAILY is I? We don't know about that.

 Let me consider ""OASIS"": but O at the start? And then A at position 2? But it has two S's? Also, OASIS has S twice.

 Since we are limited, and I want to get a good sampling, I choose:

 Word: ""ADIEU"" -> but it has E? Oh, eliminated. So we cannot use E.

 Therefore, let's try ""MOVED""? but E and D? Eliminated? We don't know about D. But E is eliminated? So ""MOVED"" has E? No.

 After some thought, I'll go with ""SALAD"": 
   S, A (position2?), L, A, D -> A at positions 2 and 5? But we don't know if the word has multiple A's? 
   Also, we have L and D. And S and D.

 But SALAD is a valid word? But the first feedback did not have A twice? Actually, we don't know.

 Alternatively, choose a word without double letters: 
   ""HAPPY""? We can avoid? But has P repeated? Not good.

 So, let's pick ""ALIGN"": 
   Letters: A, L, I, G, N -> avoid eliminated C,R,T,E? Yes. 
   Positions: 
      1: A (test A at position1)
      2: L
      3: I
      4: G
      5: N

 We get to test L, I, G, N as well.

 So I'll go with ""ALIGN"".

 But note: if the secret word does not have A at position1, then we'll get '-' for A? But we already know the secret word has A? So we'll get '-' for A at position1 if it is in the word but not at that position? And if A is at position1, we'll get ✓.

 So we'll narrow down the position of A.

 Therefore, our next guess is ""ALIGN"".

 Let me summarize: 
   We are to avoid C, R, T, E? Yes.
   We are adding: A (again, but at a new position), L, I, G, N.

 So, we return: <guess>ALIGN</guess>

 But note: the word must be a valid English word, and ""ALIGN"" is valid.

 Done.Based on the feedback from my first guess ""CRATE"":
- C, R, T, and E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- A is present but not in position 3 (marked as ""-"").

Key insights:
1. The secret word contains the letter A, positioned at 1, 2, 4, or 5.
2. My next guess must:
   - Include A in a position other than 3 (to test its location).
   - Avoid using C, R, T, E (eliminated letters).
   - Test new frequent letters like L, I, G, N, S to gather more information.

I chose ""ALIGN"":
- Tests A in position 1.
- Introduces new common letters: L (position 2), I (position 3), G (position 4), N (position 5).
- Avoids eliminated letters, maximizing new feedback potential.

<guess>ALIGN</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ALIGN -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(x) I(-) G(x) N(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:

From Guess 1 (CRATE):
- C(x), R(x), T(x), E(x): These letters are not in the secret word.
- A(-): The letter A is in the word but not in position 3.

From Guess 2 (ALIGN):
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1 (since we guessed A at position 1 and got ""-"").
- L(x): L is not in the word.
- I(-): I is in the word but not in position 3.
- G(x): G is not in the word.
- N(x): N is not in the word.

We now know:
1. The secret word contains A and I.
2. A is not in position 1 or 3 (from guesses 1 and 2).
3. I is not in position 3 (from guess 2).
4. The following letters are eliminated: C, R, T, E, L, G, N. These are not in the word.

Possible positions for A: Since A is not in position 3 (from guess 1) and not in position 1 (from guess 2), it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

Similarly, I is in the word but not in position 3, so I can be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We have two confirmed letters: A and I. We need to find three more letters, avoiding the eliminated ones.

Eliminated letters so far: C, R, T, E, L, G, N.

Common letters not yet tested: B, D, F, H, K, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We must construct a new word that:
- Includes A (in position 2, 4, or 5) and I (in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, but not 3).
- Avoids eliminated letters: C,R,T,E,L,G,N.
- Tests new letters to get more information.

Since we have limited spots (only positions 2,4,5 for A, and only positions 1,2,4,5 for I, avoiding position 3 which is where both are misplaced), we can try to pin down A's position.

Try to put A in position 2: Then we can have I in a position other than 2, so 1,4,5.

Similarly, if A is in position 4, I can be in 1,2,5, etc.

To test multiple possibilities, we can construct a word that places A in one of the possible positions (say position 2) and I in another position.

Example words:
- Consider putting A at position 2: words like _ A _ _ _
- And I at position 5: so _ A _ _ I

But we need a valid English word in between.

Possible word: ""HAVAI""? Not English.
- ""BASIS""? But B and S; but S is new. But note: we have eliminated R, so S is okay? Also, BASIS has S twice? But BASIP is not a word.

Alternative: put A at position 4 and I at position 1: I _ _ A _
Example word: ""INPUT""? But N is eliminated? Yes, we got N(x) in guess 2. And P,U,T: T is eliminated? Yes, T is eliminated from guess 1. So INPUT is invalid because of T and N.

Another idea: ""DAISY"" – but D, A, I, S, Y.
Positions: D(1), A(2), I(3), but I at position 3? But from guess 2, we know I is not in position 3? Or are we allowed to guess I again at position 3? We know from the feedback of guess 2 that I is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put I at position 3 again, it will still be ""-"" (if I is elsewhere) or maybe force a higher penalty? Actually, it's allowed, but we won't learn new info because we already know the secret word has I but not at position 3? So putting I at position 3 again will almost certainly get a ""-"", which wastes a chance.

So it's better to avoid position 3 for I and A? Actually, A is already avoided? We cannot put A at position 3? That has been tried. Similarly, we should not put I at position 3 again because we know it's not there.

Therefore, we need to pick a word that avoids position 3 for both A and I? Actually, we need to skip position 3? Or we can put a new letter at position 3.

So let's think of a word without letters at the known incorrect positions for A and I? And avoiding eliminated letters.

Assume we try A at position 2 and I at position 1: I A _ _ _

But what? IAMBS? Not English.

Put A at position 2 and I at position 4: _ A I _ _

Valid words: BAILS? But B, A, I, L? L is eliminated? L(x) from guess 2? So L is eliminated? Cannot use.

Similarly, RAINY? R is eliminated? Not possible.

Put A at position 2 and I at position 5: _ A _ _ I

Words: happy, but has Y? And P is common? But not 5-letter: HAPPY? But double P? Also, letters: H, A, P, P, I? Doesn't fit pattern.

Valid words: ""MASSAI""? Not English? Generally, let's think of common letters: S, O, M, P, D, H, B, F, K?

Word: ""BASIN"" -> B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), (no fifth? No? basin is 5 letters? B-A-S-I-N? But N is eliminated? So cannot use.

""BASIN"" has N? We cannot use N.

Another: ""CAPSI"" - C is eliminated? Not possible.

So position 2 for A may be difficult? Try A at position 4.

Put A at position 4: _ _ _ A _
But we also have I to place, say at position 1: I _ _ A _

Words: INFRA? But R and N are eliminated? Not.
IDOLA? But O, L? L is eliminated?

No: I D O L A? That's 6 letters? IDOLA is 5? I-D-O-L-A? But L is eliminated? Cannot.

Put I at position 5: _ _ _ A I

Words: OASIS? O(1), A(2), S(3), I? Positions? To have A at position 4 and I at position 5, we need a pattern: _ _ _ A I? Example: ""PUP AI"" Not. ""BOM AI"" Not.

Valid English word? ""KAPOI""? Not common.

Known word: ""TAPIR"" – T-A-P-I-R? But T is eliminated? Cannot.

This is difficult? Maybe A at position 5.

Put A at position 5: _ _ _ _ A
And I at position 1: I _ _ _ A

Words: ""INDIA""? But N and D? N is eliminated? And I at two positions? I at 1 and 4? Doesn't matter? But INDIA: I(1),N(2),D(3),I(4),A(5)? But N is eliminated, so no.

Similarly, ""IDYLL"" – L eliminated.

I think we need to be flexible? Perhaps put I and A but not restricting to specific positions without conflicts? Or choose a word that has A in one of the possible positions and I in one? But avoid overlaps? Also remember position 3 must be tested? Currently position 3 is open.

But we have two letters to place: A and I, and we know they are in the word? So any guess must include both? Unless there are multiple of them, but we don't know? We only have one each known.

Since we know A and I are present, we must include them? Yes.

But the positions are not fixed.

Alternatively, put A at position 4 and I at position 2: _ I _ A _

Words: VIMAN? Not. WIDIA? Not.

Common words: DIVAN? D-I-V-A-N? But N eliminated? Cannot.

FJORD? But R and D? R eliminated then? D is acceptable? No R? Wait: FJORD: F J O R D? R eliminated? So if we avoid R? But R is eliminated.

R is from guess 1? Yes.

So D is viable? But F J O R D: R exists? So cannot use.

Another: ""PIANO"" – P-I-A-N-O? But N is eliminated? Cannot use.

""BASIA""? Not word? OR ""MAMA"" with I? Not.

This is challenging.

Perhaps put the less common positions? Position 2 for A? But with H, S?

Example: placing A at position 5? Words ending with A: and I at position 1? Like in IRAQI? But Q,I? Letters: I, R, A, Q? But R eliminated? Not.

""PAISA""? P-A-I-S-A? But A is at position 2 and 5? That could work? But S is new.

P-A-I-S-A: positions: P(1), A(2), I(3), S(4), A(5)? I at position 3? But we have already established that I is not in position 3? From guess 2? So putting I at position 3 would be a bad move? Because we know it is not there? So we would expect a ""-"" for that I? And for the first A? At position 2: it might be correct or not? And position 5A: might be correct or wrong? But we know there is at least one A.

But feedback doesn't differentiate between duplicate letters clearly? If we have two A's, and the secret word has one? Then one A might get a ""-"" and another might get an ""x"" if not present? But we know A is present at least once? So at least one A will not be ""x"".

But in ""PAISA"", A is at 2 and 5? And I at 3? That could be a waste.

Another idea: put A at position 2 and avoid I at position 3: so have I at position 4? Then _ A _ I _ 

Example: ""BAS IS"" Not? Words like ""RABID""? But R and B eliminated? R out? R is out.

Or ""HABIT"": H(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), T(5)? But T is eliminated? Cannot use T.

""FAVOR"" - R out? Eliminated? F A V O R? R in it? No.

Look for another? ""SAUDI"": S(1), A(2), U(3), D(4), I(5)? Positions: A at 2, I at 5. And U at 3? This seems possible. Letters: S, A, U, D, I? Eliminated? Check: C,R,T,E,L,G,N are eliminated? Yes, no overlap.

So ""SAUDI"" is valid? And it tests S, U, D.

Alternatively, you could have ""DAISY""? But only if D A I S Y? But I at position 3? we know I is not in position 3? Actually, D(1), A(2), I(3), S(4), Y(5)? If we put I at 3, we know that will be '-', so we lose that chance? Better to avoid.

In ""SAUDI"": the positions are:
Position 1: S
Position 2: A
Position 3: U
Position 4: D
Position 5: I

We are testing A at position 2: if A is really at pos2, we get ✓? Else if it's elsewhere? Then '-'? Similarly, test I at position 5: if it's at 5? ✓? Else '-'. Also, S at1, U at3, D at4.

So this tests multiple new letters: S, U, D? And also confirms A and I positions? or not.

But we don't have many options? And SAUDI is a valid word.

Another word: ""SAPI"" with O? ""SAPID""? But P? and D.

""SAPID"": S(1), A(2), P(3), I(4), D(5)? Which A at 2 and I at 4? And no position 3 conflicts? But we could do that? SAPID is a word? Yes.

Compare SAUDI and SAPID:
- SAUDI tests U at position 3? And S at1, A at2, D at4, I at5.
- SAPID tests P at position 3? And S at1, A at2, I at4, D at5.

Both are good? But perhaps SAPID is less common? They are both valid.

We can use SAUDI because it has U? Which is less common? But we want to test more common letters? Like S, P, U, D.

I think S is more common, so test S and U? Or test P and D? Both can be.

But to decide, I'll pick SAUDI? Or maybe swap to avoid rare? Consider feedback potential? 

Important: We cannot use SAPID? Because if we put I at position 4, but I is already known to be present? So testing I at position 4 could be good.

Same as SAUDI places I at position 5? Which are both new positions.

So, both are acceptable? Let me choose SAUDI.

But SAUDI has U? Which may be less common? We might get more information from S and D?

Alternatively, another word: ""BACHS"" not? Or ""BAIKS"" not.

So I think SAUDI is reasonable.

But let's double-check if there are better choices? 

Another word: ""OASTS"" double S? Not ideal.

""PASTA""? P A S T A? But T is eliminated? Cannot.

So SAUDI, SAPID both feasible? But I pick SAUDI because it uses common letters? Or SAPID uses P? P is common.

But both S and P are common? So probably similar.

But we also need to avoid position 3 for the confirmed letters? Actually, in SAUDI:
- A is at position 2: if the secret word has A at 2, then ✓? Else '-'? We rule out position 1? Because already got '-', and position 3 eliminated? So only positions 2,4,5? So we test position 2 here.
- I is at position 5: testing for position 5? If not, then it can be at position 4? Because we know not at position 3? And position 1 we haven't tested? But position 1: S is at position 1? That's a new letter.

Actually, SAUDI does not test I at position 1? Which has not been tested? But we can test it later.

Alternatively, if we want to test I at position 1, we can make a word like I _ _ _ A

But earlier we had no good words? So perhaps SAUDI is practical.

We'll go with SAUDI.

Therefore, guess ""SAUDI"".

Feedback will tell us if A is in position 2 or not? And I in position 5 or not.

Also, test S at position 1? U at position 3? D at position4.

So, new guess: SAUDIBased on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **CRATE** (Guess 1): Eliminated letters C, R, T, E (all ""x""). A is present but not in position 3 (""-"").
- **ALIGN** (Guess 2): Eliminated letters L, G, N (all ""x""). A is present but not in position 1 (""-""). I is present but not in position 3 (""-""), confirming A and I are in the word but must be in new positions.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters in secret word**: A and I.
- **A is not in positions 1 or 3**: Must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- **I is not in position 3**: Must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, T, E (from Guess 1) and L, G, N (from Guess 2). Avoid using these.
- **Strategy**:
  - Test A and I in new positions to pinpoint their locations.
  - Prioritize common untested letters like S, D, U, P, B, H, K, M, O to maximize information.
  - Avoid position 3 for A and I (already known incorrect).
- **Selected Guess ""SAUDI""**:
  - **S (position 1)**: Tests a new common letter at start.
  - **A (position 2)**: Tests if A is in position 2 (✓ or -). If not, A must be in 4 or 5.
- **U (position 3)**: Tests a new vowel in a previously unexplored position.
- **D (position 4)**: Tests a common consonant.
  - **I (position 5)**: Tests if I is in position 5 (✓ or -). If not, I must be in 1, 2, or 4.  
This guess efficiently tests A and I in unconfirmed positions while introducing three new letters (S, U, D) and avoiding eliminated letters.

But note, the positions are 1-based: \n Position 1: C (x)\n Position 2: R (x)\n Position 3: A (-) -> so A is elsewhere\n Position 4: T (x)\n Position 5: E (x)\n\n So, for our next guess, we need to use words that incorporate the letter A in positions that are not 3. Also, we must avoid C, R, T, E.\n\n Let\'s think of a word that has A, and uses other common letters to maximize new information.\n\n Common vowels: besides A, we have I, O, U. But note, we can also use consonants that haven\'t been eliminated.\n\n Eliminated letters: C, R, T, E.\n We should avoid these letters.\n\n We might want to use common letters like S, N, L, O, I, D, H, etc.\n\n Since A is misplaced from position 3, let\'s try putting A in different positions.\n\n Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.\n\n One idea: try words with A in position 1? But we don\'t know if that\'s the case. We could also put it in position 4 or 5.\n\n But note: we have not tried many consonants yet. Let\'s pick a word that has A and other common letters.\n\n Some words to consider:\n - SALAD: has two A\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has multiple A\'s. But our feedback didn\'t indicate that A is repeated, but it doesn\'t rule it out either. However, from the feedback, we only know one A is present because only one was in the guess? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us about multiple occurrences unless we have multiple in the guess. So ""SALAD"" uses S, A, L, D. But we haven\'t tested S, L, D.\n\n However, note that in ""CRATE"", the letter A was in the third position and we got a \'-\', meaning there\'s at least one A elsewhere. If the secret word had two A\'s and one was in position 3, then that A would have been marked as \'-\'? Actually, the feedback system: for each letter in the guess, we compare with the word. But note, if the secret word has two A\'s, and we guess one A in a wrong position, we might get a \'-\'.\n\n Since we don\'t have much information, we\'ll avoid double letters for now.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has A in a different position, and includes other common letters.\n\n Possible candidates:\n - PLAID: P, L, A, I, D -> but we haven\'t tested P, L, I, D. And note, A is placed in position 3? That\'s the same position as before? We know A cannot be in position 3? Wait, no. The feedback says that in the first guess, the A in position 3 was present in the word but in the wrong position. That means the secret word does have an A, but not in position 3. So we can try A in other positions.\n\n But in PLAID, if we put A in position 4? Actually, the word PLAID has the letters: P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), D(5). So A is in position 3 again, which we know is incorrect? But wouldn\'t we get a \'-\' again for A if it was in position 3? Actually, we wouldn\'t want to put A in position 3 because we know that position is incorrect? Or does it mean that the A we guessed at position 3 is present elsewhere? Actually, the \'-\' means the letter A is in the word, but not at position 3. So we must avoid putting A at position 3? We can, but it will likely result in the same feedback for that position if the secret word doesn\'t have an A at position 3.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put A in another position to see if we can locate it.\n\n A good approach is to put A in a position we haven\'t tested: position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n Let\'s try position 1: words starting with A.\n\n Examples: \n - ABOVE: has A(1), B, O, V, E -> but E is eliminated? Our feedback said E is eliminated (E:x). So we cannot use E. Also, V is not common.\n\n - ALONG: A(1), L, O, N, G. This avoids C, R, T, E. Uses O, L, N, G. We haven\'t tested these letters.\n\n - ALIGN: A(1), L, I, G, N.\n\n - APPLE: but we won\'t use because E is eliminated and has double P? Also, we have PP and E is eliminated.\n\n Since E is eliminated, we choose ALONG or ALIGN.\n\n Another option: put A in position 2.\n\n Words: SALON, BALMY, etc. But SALON: S, A, L, O, N -> avoids eliminated letters.\n\n Also, we can put A in position 4: e.g., with words like PLAZA? Not ideal because of double A and we don\'t know.\n\n Let\'s go with ALIGN: \n - A at position 1: that\'s a new position.\n - Then we get to test L, I, G, N.\n\n But note: if the secret word does have A at position 1, then we\'ll get a \'✓\' for A. If not, we\'ll get a \'-\' if A is elsewhere? Or \'x\' if not? We know A is present so it cannot be \'x\'. So we\'ll either get ✓ or - for A.\n\n Alternatively, if we want more new information, we might avoid putting A at position 1 because it\'s a possibility. But testing A at a new position is good.\n\n Another common word: SAUNA? But double A and U.\n\n Let me pick a word that has A at a different position and uses new letters.\n\n Idea: SAILS? But that has S at the beginning. Also, we don\'t know about S. Or SOAPY? But O and Y.\n\n Considering avoiding eliminated letters and maximizing new letters, let\'s go with:\n\n Option: SALON (S, A, L, O, N) \n - A is at position 2.\n\n Option: MANGO (M, A, N, G, O) \n - A at position 2.\n\n However, M and G are new.\n\n But note: we also want to check if the word has other vowels. I and O are common.\n\n Let me choose ""ALIEN"". But E is eliminated? We cannot use E. So that\'s out.\n\n We need a word without C, R, T, E.\n\n Let\'s look for words that have A in either position 1, 2, 4 or 5 and without eliminated letters.\n\n After consideration, I think ""PIANO"" is a good candidate: \n - P, I, A, N, O. \n - A is at position 3? Oh no, we cannot put A at position 3 because we already know that position 3 is not A? But wait: \n   In ""PIANO"": positions: 1-P, 2-I, 3-A, 4-N, 5-O.\n\n We know from the first guess that A is not in position 3? Only that in the first guess, the A at position 3 was not correct because it was moved to another position? Actually, the feedback for the first guess: A in position 3 was marked ""-"", meaning it is not in that position. However, if we put A again in position 3, then:\n   - If the secret word has A at position 3, then we would get a ""✓"", but we were told it\'s not at position 3? Actually, the first feedback tells us that the secret word does NOT have A at position 3? Correct.\n\n So in the second guess, if we put A at position 3 again, we know that the feedback for that position will be either:\n   - If the secret word has A at position 3 (contradiction), then we get ✓? But wait, the first feedback said it\'s not at position 3, so it shouldn\'t be there.\n\n Therefore, putting A in position 3 in the second guess would be wasting that spot? We would know that it is incorrect? And we might get a \'-\' again? Actually, if we put A in position 3 again, and the secret word does have A elsewhere (but not at position 3), then we\'ll get a \'-\' again? Because the letter A is present but not at position 3. But that doesn\'t give us new information about the position of A.\n\n So it\'s better to avoid position 3 for A and try it in a new position.\n\n So I decide to avoid position 3.\n\n Final choice: let\'s try ""PIANA"" is not a word. How about ""PLAIN"": \n - PLAIN: P(1), L(2), A(3) -> A at position 3? No, same issue.\n\n ""PANDA"": P(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), A(5) -> But A is in position 2 and 5? And position 3 is N. This has A at position 2 and 5? But let me check: it might be. But the word PANDA has two A\'s? Actually, the last letter is A? No, PANDA is P-A-N-D-A. So we are putting A in positions 2 and 5? Then the feedback might be: \n   Position 2: if the secret word has A at position 2, then ✓, otherwise if A is elsewhere we might get \'-\'? And position 5: similarly? But we don\'t know if the word has one A or two.\n\n Since we don\'t have much information about multiple letters, it\'s better to avoid double letters until we have more info.\n\n Let me choose a word with A at position 1: \n - ALBUM: but B, U, M? But also U is a vowel? It\'s acceptable.\n\n But let me think of one that uses more common letters. \n\n Suggested word: ""BASIC"". But note: \n   B A S I C: A at position2? And we see: \n   We\'ll have to avoid B, S, I, C? But C was eliminated? The first feedback: C was x, so it\'s eliminated. So ""BASIC"" has C? Which is eliminated. Cannot use.\n\n Alternative: ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A at position 2? \n   But D, I, L, Y are new.\n\n However, note: position 3 in the word DAILY is I? We don\'t know about that.\n\n Let me consider ""OASIS"": but O at the start? And then A at position 2? But it has two S\'s? Also, OASIS has S twice.\n\n Since we are limited, and I want to get a good sampling, I choose:\n\n Word: ""ADIEU"" -> but it has E? Oh, eliminated. So we cannot use E.\n\n Therefore, let\'s try ""MOVED""? but E and D? Eliminated? We don\'t know about D. But E is eliminated? So ""MOVED"" has E? No.\n\n After some thought, I\'ll go with ""SALAD"": \n   S, A (position2?), L, A, D -> A at positions 2 and 5? But we don\'t know if the word has multiple A\'s? \n   Also, we have L and D. And S and D.\n\n But SALAD is a valid word? But the first feedback did not have A twice? Actually, we don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, choose a word without double letters: \n   ""HAPPY""? We can avoid? But has P repeated? Not good.\n\n So, let\'s pick ""ALIGN"": \n   Letters: A, L, I, G, N -> avoid eliminated C,R,T,E? Yes. \n   Positions: \n      1: A (test A at position1)\n      2: L\n      3: I\n      4: G\n      5: N\n\n We get to test L, I, G, N as well.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""ALIGN"".\n\n But note: if the secret word does not have A at position1, then we\'ll get \'-\' for A? But we already know the secret word has A? So we\'ll get \'-\' for A at position1 if it is in the word but not at that position? And if A is at position1, we\'ll get ✓.\n\n So we\'ll narrow down the position of A.\n\n Therefore, our next guess is ""ALIGN"".\n\n Let me summarize: \n   We are to avoid C, R, T, E? Yes.\n   We are adding: A (again, but at a new position), L, I, G, N.\n\n So, we return: <guess>ALIGN</guess>\n\n But note: the word must be a valid English word, and ""ALIGN"" is valid.\n\n Done.Based on the feedback from my first guess ""CRATE"":\n- C, R, T, and E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").\n- A is present but not in position 3 (marked as ""-"").\n\nKey insights:\n1. The secret word contains the letter A, positioned at 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n2. My next guess must:\n   - Include A in a position other than 3 (to test its location).\n   - Avoid using C, R, T, E (eliminated letters).\n   - Test new frequent letters like L, I, G, N, S to gather more information.\n\nI chose ""ALIGN"":\n- Tests A in position 1.\n- Introduces new common letters: L (position 2), I (position 3), G (position 4), N (position 5).\n- Avoids eliminated letters, maximizing new feedback potential.\n\n<guess>ALIGN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ALIGN -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(x) I(-) G(x) N(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:\n\nFrom Guess 1 (CRATE):\n- C(x), R(x), T(x), E(x): These letters are not in the secret word.\n- A(-): The letter A is in the word but not in position 3.\n\nFrom Guess 2 (ALIGN):\n- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1 (since we guessed A at position 1 and got ""-"").\n- L(x): L is not in the word.\n- I(-): I is in the word but not in position 3.\n- G(x): G is not in the word.\n- N(x): N is not in the word.\n\nWe now know:\n1. The secret word contains A and I.\n2. A is not in position 1 or 3 (from guesses 1 and 2).\n3. I is not in position 3 (from guess 2).\n4. The following letters are eliminated: C, R, T, E, L, G, N. These are not in the word.\n\nPossible positions for A: Since A is not in position 3 (from guess 1) and not in position 1 (from guess 2), it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, I is in the word but not in position 3, so I can be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nWe have two confirmed letters: A and I.

Not English.\n- ""BASIS""? But B and S; but S is new. But note: we have eliminated R, so S is okay? Also, BASIS has S twice? But BASIP is not a word.\n\nAlternative: put A at position 4 and I at position 1: I _ _ A _\nExample word: ""INPUT""? But N is eliminated? Yes, we got N(x) in guess 2. And P,U,T: T is eliminated? Yes, T is eliminated from guess 1. So INPUT is invalid because of T and N.\n\nAnother idea: ""DAISY"" – but D, A, I, S, Y.\nPositions: D(1), A(2), I(3), but I at position 3? But from guess 2, we know I is not in position 3? Or are we allowed to guess I again at position 3? We know from the feedback of guess 2 that I is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put I at position 3 again, it will still be ""-"" (if I is elsewhere) or maybe force a higher penalty? Actually, it\'s allowed, but we won\'t learn new info because we already know the secret word has I but not at position 3? So putting I at position 3 again will almost certainly get a ""-"", which wastes a chance.\n\nSo it\'s better to avoid position 3 for I and A? Actually, A is already avoided? We cannot put A at position 3? That has been tried. Similarly, we should not put I at position 3 again because we know it\'s not there.\n\nTherefore, we need to pick a word that avoids position 3 for both A and I? Actually, we need to skip position 3? Or we can put a new letter at position 3.\n\nSo let\'s think of a word without letters at the known incorrect positions for A and I? And avoiding eliminated letters.\n\nAssume we try A at position 2 and I at position 1: I A _ _ _\n\nBut what? IAMBS? Not English.\n\nPut A at position 2 and I at position 4: _ A I _ _\n\nValid words: BAILS? But B, A, I, L? L is eliminated? L(x) from guess 2? So L is eliminated? Cannot use.\n\nSimilarly, RAINY? R is eliminated? Not possible.\n\nPut A at position 2 and I at position 5: _ A _ _ I\n\nWords: happy, but has Y? And P is common? But not 5-letter: HAPPY? But double P? Also, letters: H, A, P, P, I? Doesn\'t fit pattern.\n\nValid words: ""MASSAI""? Not English? Generally, let\'s think of common letters: S, O, M, P, D, H, B, F, K?\n\nWord: ""BASIN"" -> B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), (no fifth? No? basin is 5 letters? B-A-S-I-N? But N is eliminated? So cannot use.\n\n""BASIN"" has N? We cannot use N.\n\nAnother: ""CAPSI"" - C is eliminated? Not possible.\n\nSo position 2 for A may be difficult? Try A at position 4.\n\nPut A at position 4: _ _ _ A _\nBut we also have I to place, say at position 1: I _ _ A _\n\nWords: INFRA? But R and N are eliminated? Not.\nIDOLA? But O, L? L is eliminated?\n\nNo: I D O L A? That\'s 6 letters? IDOLA is 5? I-D-O-L-A? But L is eliminated? Cannot.\n\nPut I at position 5: _ _ _ A I\n\nWords: OASIS? O(1), A(2), S(3), I? Positions? To have A at position 4 and I at position 5, we need a pattern: _ _ _ A I? Example: ""PUP AI"" Not. ""BOM AI"" Not.\n\nValid English word? ""KAPOI""? Not common.\n\nKnown word: ""TAPIR"" – T-A-P-I-R? But T is eliminated? Cannot.\n\nThis is difficult? Maybe A at position 5.\n\nPut A at position 5: _ _ _ _ A\nAnd I at position 1: I _ _ _ A\n\nWords: ""INDIA""? But N and D? N is eliminated? And I at two positions? I at 1 and 4? Doesn\'t matter? But INDIA: I(1),N(2),D(3),I(4),A(5)? But N is eliminated, so no.\n\nSimilarly, ""IDYLL"" – L eliminated.\n\nI think we need to be flexible? Perhaps put I and A but not restricting to specific positions without conflicts? Or choose a word that has A in one of the possible positions and I in one? But avoid overlaps? Also remember position 3 must be tested? Currently position 3 is open.\n\nBut we have two letters to place: A and I, and we know they are in the word? So any guess must include both? Unless there are multiple of them, but we don\'t know? We only have one each known.\n\nSince we know A and I are present, we must include them? Yes.\n\nBut the positions are not fixed.\n\nAlternatively, put A at position 4 and I at position 2: _ I _ A _\n\nWords: VIMAN? Not. WIDIA? Not.\n\nCommon words: DIVAN? D-I-V-A-N? But N eliminated? Cannot.\n\nFJORD? But R and D? R eliminated then? D is acceptable? No R? Wait: FJORD: F J O R D? R eliminated? So if we avoid R? But R is eliminated.\n\nR is from guess 1? Yes.\n\nSo D is viable? But F J O R D: R exists? So cannot use.\n\nAnother: ""PIANO"" – P-I-A-N-O? But N is eliminated? Cannot use.\n\n""BASIA""? Not word? OR ""MAMA"" with I? Not.\n\nThis is challenging.\n\nPerhaps put the less common positions? Position 2 for A? But with H, S?\n\nExample: placing A at position 5? Words ending with A: and I at position 1? Like in IRAQI? But Q,I? Letters: I, R, A, Q? But R eliminated? Not.\n\n""PAISA""? P-A-I-S-A? But A is at position 2 and 5? That could work? But S is new.\n\nP-A-I-S-A: positions: P(1), A(2), I(3), S(4), A(5)? I at position 3? But we have already established that I is not in position 3? From guess 2? So putting I at position 3 would be a bad move? Because we know it is not there? So we would expect a ""-"" for that I? And for the first A? At position 2: it might be correct or not? And position 5A: might be correct or wrong? But we know there is at least one A.\n\nBut feedback doesn\'t differentiate between duplicate letters clearly? If we have two A\'s, and the secret word has one? Then one A might get a ""-"" and another might get an ""x"" if not present? But we know A is present at least once? So at least one A will not be ""x"".\n\nBut in ""PAISA"", A is at 2 and 5? And I at 3? That could be a waste.\n\nAnother idea: put A at position 2 and avoid I at position 3: so have I at position 4? Then _ A _ I _ \n\nExample: ""BAS IS"" Not? Words like ""RABID""? But R and B eliminated? R out? R is out.\n\nOr ""HABIT"": H(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), T(5)? But T is eliminated? Cannot use T.\n\n""FAVOR"" - R out? Eliminated? F A V O R? R in it? No.\n\nLook for another? ""SAUDI"": S(1), A(2), U(3), D(4), I(5)? Positions: A at 2, I at 5. And U at 3? This seems possible. Letters: S, A, U, D, I? Eliminated? Check: C,R,T,E,L,G,N are eliminated? Yes, no overlap.\n\nSo ""SAUDI"" is valid? And it tests S, U, D.\n\nAlternatively, you could have ""DAISY""? But only if D A I S Y? But I at position 3? we know I is not in position 3? Actually, D(1), A(2), I(3), S(4), Y(5)? If we put I at 3, we know that will be \'-\', so we lose that chance? Better to avoid.\n\nIn ""SAUDI"": the positions are:\nPosition 1: S\nPosition 2: A\nPosition 3: U\nPosition 4: D\nPosition 5: I\n\nWe are testing A at position 2: if A is really at pos2, we get ✓? Else if it\'s elsewhere? Then \'-\'? Similarly, test I at position 5: if it\'s at 5? ✓? Else \'-\'. Also, S at1, U at3, D at4.\n\nSo this tests multiple new letters: S, U, D? And also confirms A and I positions? or not.\n\nBut we don\'t have many options? And SAUDI is a valid word.\n\nAnother word: ""SAPI"" with O? ""SAPID""? But P? and D.\n\n""SAPID"": S(1), A(2), P(3), I(4), D(5)? Which A at 2 and I at 4? And no position 3 conflicts? But we could do that? SAPID is a word? Yes.\n\nCompare SAUDI and SAPID:\n- SAUDI tests U at position 3? And S at1, A at2, D at4, I at5.\n- SAPID tests P at position 3? And S at1, A at2, I at4, D at5.\n\nBoth are good? But perhaps SAPID is less common? They are both valid.\n\nWe can use SAUDI because it has U? Which is less common? But we want to test more common letters? Like S, P, U, D.\n\nI think S is more common, so test S and U? Or test P and D? Both can be.\n\nBut to decide, I\'ll pick SAUDI? Or maybe swap to avoid rare? Consider feedback potential? \n\nImportant: We cannot use SAPID? Because if we put I at position 4, but I is already known to be present? So testing I at position 4 could be good.\n\nSame as SAUDI places I at position 5? Which are both new positions.\n\nSo, both are acceptable? Let me choose SAUDI.\n\nBut SAUDI has U? Which may be less common? We might get more information from S and D?\n\nAlternatively, another word: ""BACHS"" not? Or ""BAIKS"" not.\n\nSo I think SAUDI is reasonable.\n\nBut let\'s double-check if there are better choices? \n\nAnother word: ""OASTS"" double S? Not ideal.\n\n""PASTA""? P A S T A? But T is eliminated? Cannot.\n\nSo SAUDI, SAPID both feasible? But I pick SAUDI because it uses common letters? Or SAPID uses P? P is common.\n\nBut both S and P are common? So probably similar.\n\nBut we also need to avoid position 3 for the confirmed letters? Actually, in SAUDI:\n- A is at position 2: if the secret word has A at 2, then ✓? Else \'-\'? We rule out position 1? Because already got \'-\', and position 3 eliminated? So only positions 2,4,5? So we test position 2 here.\n- I is at position 5: testing for position 5? If not, then it can be at position 4? Because we know not at position 3? And position 1 we haven\'t tested? But position 1: S is at position 1? That\'s a new letter.\n\nActually, SAUDI does not test I at position 1? Which has not been tested? But we can test it later.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to test I at position 1, we can make a word like I _ _ _ A\n\nBut earlier we had no good words? So perhaps SAUDI is practical.\n\nWe\'ll go with SAUDI.\n\nTherefore, guess ""SAUDI"".\n\nFeedback will tell us if A is in position 2 or not? And I in position 5 or not.\n\nAlso, test S at position 1? U at position 3? D at position4.\n\nSo, new guess: SAUDIBased on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n- **CRATE** (Guess 1): Eliminated letters C, R, T, E (all ""x""). A is present but not in position 3 (""-"").\n- **ALIGN** (Guess 2): Eliminated letters L, G, N (all ""x""). A is present but not in position 1 (""-""). I is present but not in position 3 (""-""), confirming A and I are in the word but must be in new positions.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Confirmed letters in secret word**: A and I.\n- **A is not in positions 1 or 3**: Must be in position 2, 4, or 5.\n- **I is not in position 3**: Must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, T, E (from Guess 1) and L, G, N (from Guess 2). Avoid using these.\n- **Strategy**:\n  - Test A and I in new positions to pinpoint their locations.\n  - Prioritize common untested letters like S, D, U, P, B, H, K, M, O to maximize information.\n  - Avoid position 3 for A and I (already known incorrect).\n- **Selected Guess ""SAUDI""**:\n  - **S (position 1)**: Tests a new common letter at start.\n  - **A (position 2)**: Tests if A is in position 2 (✓ or -). If not, A must be in 4 or 5.\n- **U (position 3)**: Tests a new vowel in a previously unexplored position.\n- **D (position 4)**: Tests a common consonant.\n  - **I (position 5)**: Tests if I is in position 5 (✓ or -). If not, I must be in 1, 2, or 4.  \nThis guess efficiently tests A and I in unconfirmed positions while introducing three new letters (S, U, D) and avoiding eliminated letters.\n\n<guess>SAUDI</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ALIGN -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(x) I(-) G(x) N(x)\nGuess 3: SAUDI -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: CRATE -> C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
  - Meaning: C, R, T, E are not in the word. A is in the word but not in position 3.

Guess 2: ALIGN -> A(-) L(x) I(-) G(x) N(x)
  - Meaning: L, G, N are not in the word. A is in the word but not in position 1. I is in the word but not in position 3.

Guess 3: SAUDI -> S(x) A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(-)
  - Meaning: S, U, D are not in the word. A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2). I is in the word but not in position 5.

Important deductions so far:

1. From Guess 3: A(✓) at position 2. So the secret word has A as the second letter: _ A _ _ _

2. Also from Guess 3: I(-) at position 5. So I is in the word but not in position 5. Combined with previous feedback (I not in position 3), so I can be in position 1 or 4 (since position 2 is taken by A).

3. Eliminated letters: C, R, T, E, L, G, N, S, U, D (all from ""x"" in feedbacks). So we cannot use these.

4. Confirmed letters: A (position 2) and I (somewhere, not position 3 or 5).

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ A _ _ _

And I must be in position 1 or 4.

We also have one more vacancy: positions 3,4,5? Actually, positions: 1, 3, 4, 5. But position 2 is fixed as A.

Position 2 is fixed: A.

So structure: [1] A [3] [4] [5]

And I can be in position 1 or 4? Because:

- Position 3: we don't know? Wait, the only known restrictions on I are from Guess 2 (not position 3) and Guess 3 (not position 5). And position 2 is taken by A? So I cannot be there? So yes, I must be in position 1 or 4.

But we also know that position 1 is open? And position 4 is open.

Now, there are two possibilities:

Case 1: I at position 1 -> Word: I A _ _ _

Case 2: I at position 4 -> Word: _ A _ I _

We need to find what fills the blanks, avoiding eliminated letters.

Moreover, we know from Guess 1 that A was misplaced at position 3? Now we have A fixed at position 2, so the other positions are unknown.

What about the other letters? We have positions 3 and 5 to fill? Or position 1 or 4 depending on case? Actually:

In Case 1: I at position 1. Then the word has: I A [3] [4] [5]
But I is at position 1? That's a guess? Not necessarily true? We don't know yet? We only know I is in the word at either position 1 or 4.

Similarly, Case 2: _ A [3] I [5]

We have 2 scenarios? And we need to guess a word that fits one of them? And tests which is correct.

We also need to avoid eliminated letters: C,R,T,E,L,G,N,S,U,D.

So available letters for the remaining positions: all letters except these: B, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? But we must form valid English words.

Since we have limited guesses left? We have 3 tries? We started?

We want to test the location of I? And fill the blanks.

We observe:

Case 1: If I in position 1? Then we have words like: I A ??? ?

Case 2: If I in position 4? Then we have ??? with _ A _ I ?

So let's find words fitting each pattern:

First, Case 1: I at position 1? Words: IAMBS? Not. I think of:

- IAMBI? Not a word? Or?
- Known words: IODIC? But O,D? D eliminated? Not.
- IMBUE? But U eliminated? Not.
- IMPLY? But L,Y? L eliminated? And Y?
- IOTAS? But O,T,S? T and S eliminated? Not.
- ICHOR? But C,H,O,R? C and R eliminated? Not.

Case 1 may not have common words? Without eliminated letters? Available letters? No D, S, U, L, G, N, C, R, T, E.

Try: ""IAMMA""? Not? ""IAWIS""? Not? I think Case 1 is probably rare?

Case 2: I at position 4? Word: _ A _ I _

Pattern: [1] A [3] I [5]

Letters we can use: B, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? Etc.

Examples:
- BAITI? Not? ""HAPPY""? But no I? Must be I at position 4?
- Word: ""MANIA""? But M,A,N,I,A? But A already fixed? And positions? M(1), A(2), N(3), I(4), A(5)? How does that match? [1] A [3] I [5] -> M A ? I A? Wait, position 3 is N? Position 5 is A? But N eliminated? So not.
- MAFIA? M(1), A(2), F(3), I(4), A(5)? Then yes? F is new? And A at position 5? We know A is fixed at position 2? But there can be duplicate A? We haven't ruled that. However, N? No, MAFIA has no N? Letters: M, A, F, I, A? Positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:F, 4:I, 5:A. But eliminated? S,U,D? Not here? And available? M and F allowed? Also, no eliminated letters.

MAFIA is a word? Yes.

Other words:
- ""RABBI""? But R eliminated? Not?
- ""TABI""? Not 5 letters? TABI is 4.
- ""WACKY""? No I? Must have I at position 4.
- ""TAXIS""? T eliminated? And X? Not?
- ""CABIN""? C eliminated? Not?
- ""HAVIO""? But V,I,O? Yet: H(1), A(2), V(3), I(4), O(5)? So H A V I O? Which is HAVIO? Is that a word? Not commonly? But HAVENO? Not.

""MAFIA"" uses M, F, I, and A? And positions: M(1), A(2), F(3), I(4), A(5). So it has A at position 5? But in the secret word, since A is fixed at position 2, a second A at position 5 is possible? From feedback, we know A is at position 2? And if there is an extra A? The feedback doesn't rule out multiple A's? For example, in Guess 3: SAUDI has only one A? But that doesn't disprove multiple.

Another word: ""BABI"" with S? ""BABEL""? E eliminated? Not?
""BAJRI""? Not common?
""BACCHUS""? Too long?

I think MAFIA is a valid option? Also words like ""PANIC""? P(1), A(2), N(3), I(4), C(5)? But N and C eliminated? Not.

Another word: ""PACIF""? Not? ""PATIO""? T? Eliminated? Not.

""MAJIK""? M(1), A(2), J(3), I(4), K(5)? MAJIK is a word? Like majik? Or variant? But let's stick to common words.

""OBIAS""? O B I A S? S eliminated? Not?

But MAFIA seems reasonable? Available letters? M, F, I, A? And I would be at position 4? Position 5: A? So pattern: [1]A[3]I[5] with 1:M, 3:F, 5:A? Then word: M A F I A.

Also, think of: ""MACHO""? But C,H? C eliminated? Not.

Therefore, we have candidate MAFIA? But note: position 1 is M? Position 3 is F? Position 5 is A? And position 4 is I.

But we know the word must have exactly the letters? And MAFIA has two A's? That's fine? Since A can be repeated? Or not? We don't know? But possible.

To test if I is at position 4? And if there is an A at position 5? Or what?

We can guess MAFIA? But also, we need to consider if our case is wrong? What if I is at position 1? Then MAFIA would not fit? Because MAFIA has I at position 4? And no I at position 1.

But actually, we are guessing based on the pattern? So if the secret word is MAFIA, then it would be correct? If not, we get feedback.

But let me think of another word with I at position 4? And position 1? Not M? Other letters.

For example: ""HAIKU""? H(1), A(2), I? Not? Position? H A I K U? That's H-A-I-K-U? I is at position 3? Which we know I is not at position 3? Because from Guess2? So cannot use I at position 3? We must avoid putting I at position 3.

HAIKU has I at position 3? Not acceptable? Because I cannot be at position 3? So unusable.

Another word: ""FAITH""? But T,H? T eliminated? Not.

""DAILY""? But D and L eliminated? Not.

""WAIFT""? W,A,I,F,T? T eliminated? Not.

""PAIVS""? Not a word.

So MAFIA seems a practical guess? Or try ""MANIA""? But N eliminated? Not possible? Earlier we thought? M A N I A? N eliminated? So no.

Another candidate: ""KAFIR""? K(1),A(2),F(3),I(4),R(5)? But R eliminated? Cannot.

""QADAR""? Not word.

Therefore, let's stick with MAFIA? But note: MAFIA has I at position 4? Which matches Case 2? And A at position 5? So we are guessing that? If the secret word has I at position 4? We get confirmation or not.

Alternatively, we can design a guess that tests both cases? For example, include both position 1 and position 4 possibilities? But that would require I at position 1 and I at position 4? Then we have double I? Like ""MAFII""? Not valid.

So we need to choose a pattern? MAFIA seems a word? And it uses M and F? Which are common? Also, we have not tested them.

But notice: in MAFIA, position 5 is A? But in Guess 3, we had SAUDI with I at position 5? Which was '-' meaning I is not at position 5? But if we now have A at position 5? That's not I? So that's fine? Because I is not at position 5? We are putting A at position 5? That's not I.

Position 5: A? So we are not guessing I there? That's fine? Because our guess MAFIA will have:
- M: position 1? Not known
- A: position 2? We know correct? So ✓
- F: position 3? Not known
- I: position 4? If I is indeed at position 4? Then ✓ for I at position 4? If not, then '-' meaning I is elsewhere? Or if our case is wrong, perhaps I is at position 1? Then I at position 4 would be '-'? And we'll learn? Also, position 5: A? Which we know there is at least one A? But already at position 2, so if there is an extra A, it could be? Or feedback might be '-' if another A elsewhere? Or 'x' if no extra A? But we don't know if there is an extra A?

Therefore, let's propose ""MAFIA"" as the guess.

But wait: we must confirm the word? MAFIA is valid? Yes.

Also, feedback potential:

- If MAFIA is correct, we win?
- If not:
   - Position 2: A will be ✓? Always? Because confirmed.
   - Position 4: I, if the secret word has I at position 4? ✓? If not, '-' meaning I is elsewhere? Then we'll know I must be at position 1? Because no other.
   - Position 1: M? Feedback: if M in the word? How? Not tested before? So ✓, -, or x?
   - Similarly for F and the second A at position 5.

Case 1: the word has I at position 1? Then we don't expect I to be at position 4? So if we guess MAFIA, position 4 I would be '-' if I is elsewhere? Or perhaps no? Since we have guessed I at position 4, and if I is at position 1, then the feedback for position 4 I would be ""x"" if there is no I at position 4? Actually, no? We know there is one I? Then if we put I at position 4 and it's really at position 1? Then the feedback would be '-'? Because the letter I is in the word? But not at position 4? Since we know only one I? Then '-' for position 4 I? And then position 1 M must be something else? Perhaps we'll see.

But regardless, after this guess? We'll narrow it.

But to maximize? Perhaps we need a word that forces distinction? Or just guess MAFIA.

Another candidate: ""BAKER""? But E and R eliminated? No.

Or ""FIBER""? E,R eliminated? Not.

So I think ""MAFIA"" is passable.

Therefore, guess ""MAFIA"".

But let's be systematic: From Guess 3, A at position 2 is fixed? And I is at either position 1 or position 4.

If I is at position 1, we don't know a word? That seems unlikely? Because we searched? Maybe I missed?

Possible word with I at 1: ""IAMBS""? not? ""IAWIS""? not? ""ICHOR""? C and R gone? ""IKONS""? K O N S? N and S eliminated? No? ""ILIAD""? L and D eliminated? No? ""IODID""? D gone? ""IVIED""? D gone? ""ONIUM""? O N I U M? But not I at beginning? Etc.

So Case 1 is likely not occurring? So Case 2 is probable? I at position 4.

Then we complete positions 1,3,5.

MAFIA assumes M at1, F at3, A at5? But A at5 is additional? We don't know if required.

We could guess a word without duplicate A? For example: ""PAPIO""? P A P I O? But O? And P repeated? Not? ""BABIO""? B A B I O? Similar? Avoid duplicates? Since we don't know if duplicate A.

But MAFIA uses the letters MAFIA? Which includes A twice? But could be.

Another word: ""JAVAI""? Not? ""KAPAS""? Not? Perhaps ""MAFIO""? Not? So few options.

Therefore, we'll go with MAFIA? Or another word with I at position 4? Like ""MAPSI""? Not? ""MARIA""? But R eliminated? No? ""BANYA""? B A N Y A? N eliminated? No? So MAFIA remains.

Guess: MAFIA

Done.
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Eliminated Letters**: All guesses confirm that the following letters are **not** in the secret word due to ""x"" feedback:  
  - Guess 1: C, R, T, E  
  - Guess 2: L, G, N  
  - Guess 3: S, U, D  
  Combined eliminated letters: **C, R, T, E, L, G, N, S, U, D**  

- **Confirmed Letter Positon**:  
  - From Guess 3: **A(✓) at position 2** → The secret word has **A** as the second letter: `_ A _ _ _`  

- **Misplaced Letters** (present but wrong position):  
  - **A** was misplaced in positions 1 (Guess 2) and 3 (Guess 1).  
  - **I** is in the word but misplaced in positions 3 (Guess 2) and 5 (Guess 3). Given positions 2 (A), 3, and 5 are invalid for I, it must be in **position 1 or 4**.  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- The secret word format is: `[position1] A [position3] [position4] [position5]`.  
- **Position 1/4 must contain I** (since I is confirmed and only positions 1/4 are plausible).  
- Remaining positions (3, and 5/position1/position4 depending on I) must be filled with letter not eliminated.  
- Focus on testing positions for **I** while introducing new letters:  
  - **Option 1**: Guess a word where I is in position 1 (e.g., `I A _ _ _`). However, few valid English words fit this pattern after eliminations (e.g., ""IAMBS"" invalid).  
  - **Option 2**: Guess a word where I is in position 4 (e.g., `_ A _ I _`). More feasible.  
- Selecting **""MAFIA""** for Guess 4:  
  - Tests **I in position 4** (if I is here, ✓; if not, I must be in position 1).  
  - **M, F** are new untested letters (common consonants).  
  - Ends with **A** at position 5 (could be duplicate; tested implicitly).  
  - Avoids eliminated letters and aligns with word pattern.

### Expected Feedback Insights
- If **I(✓)** at position 4, I is confirmed.  
- If **I(-)** at position 4, I must be in position 1 (only remaining option).  
- **A** at position 5 tests for duplicate A presence.

<guess>MAFIA</guess>",MAFIA,"We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: CRATE -> C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
  - Meaning: C, R, T, E are not in the word. A is in the word but not in position 3.

Guess 2: ALIGN -> A(-) L(x) I(-) G(x) N(x)
  - Meaning: L, G, N are not in the word. A is in the word but not in position 1. I is in the word but not in position 3.

Guess 3: SAUDI -> S(x) A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(-)
  - Meaning: S, U, D are not in the word. A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2). I is in the word but not in position 5.

Important deductions so far:

1. From Guess 3: A(✓) at position 2. So the secret word has A as the second letter: _ A _ _ _

2. Also from Guess 3: I(-) at position 5. So I is in the word but not in position 5. Combined with previous feedback (I not in position 3), so I can be in position 1 or 4 (since position 2 is taken by A).

3. Eliminated letters: C, R, T, E, L, G, N, S, U, D (all from ""x"" in feedbacks). So we cannot use these.

4. Confirmed letters: A (position 2) and I (somewhere, not position 3 or 5).

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ A _ _ _

And I must be in position 1 or 4.

We also have one more vacancy: positions 3,4,5? Actually, positions: 1, 3, 4, 5. But position 2 is fixed as A.

Position 2 is fixed: A.

So structure: [1] A [3] [4] [5]

And I can be in position 1 or 4? Because:

- Position 3: we don't know? Wait, the only known restrictions on I are from Guess 2 (not position 3) and Guess 3 (not position 5). And position 2 is taken by A? So I cannot be there? So yes, I must be in position 1 or 4.

But we also know that position 1 is open? And position 4 is open.

Now, there are two possibilities:

Case 1: I at position 1 -> Word: I A _ _ _

Case 2: I at position 4 -> Word: _ A _ I _

We need to find what fills the blanks, avoiding eliminated letters.

Moreover, we know from Guess 1 that A was misplaced at position 3? Now we have A fixed at position 2, so the other positions are unknown.

What about the other letters? We have positions 3 and 5 to fill? Or position 1 or 4 depending on case? Actually:

In Case 1: I at position 1. Then the word has: I A [3] [4] [5]
But I is at position 1? That's a guess? Not necessarily true? We don't know yet? We only know I is in the word at either position 1 or 4.

Similarly, Case 2: _ A [3] I [5]

We have 2 scenarios? And we need to guess a word that fits one of them? And tests which is correct.

We also need to avoid eliminated letters: C,R,T,E,L,G,N,S,U,D.

So available letters for the remaining positions: all letters except these: B, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? But we must form valid English words.

Since we have limited guesses left? We have 3 tries? We started?

We want to test the location of I? And fill the blanks.

We observe:

Case 1: If I in position 1? Then we have words like: I A ??? ?

Case 2: If I in position 4? Then we have ??? with _ A _ I ?

So let's find words fitting each pattern:

First, Case 1: I at position 1? Words: IAMBS? Not. I think of:

- IAMBI? Not a word? Or?
- Known words: IODIC? But O,D? D eliminated? Not.
- IMBUE? But U eliminated? Not.
- IMPLY? But L,Y? L eliminated? And Y?
- IOTAS? But O,T,S? T and S eliminated? Not.
- ICHOR? But C,H,O,R? C and R eliminated? Not.

Case 1 may not have common words? Without eliminated letters? Available letters? No D, S, U, L, G, N, C, R, T, E.

Try: ""IAMMA""? Not? ""IAWIS""? Not? I think Case 1 is probably rare?

Case 2: I at position 4? Word: _ A _ I _

Pattern: [1] A [3] I [5]

Letters we can use: B, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? Etc.

Examples:
- BAITI? Not? ""HAPPY""? But no I? Must be I at position 4?
- Word: ""MANIA""? But M,A,N,I,A? But A already fixed? And positions? M(1), A(2), N(3), I(4), A(5)? How does that match? [1] A [3] I [5] -> M A ? I A? Wait, position 3 is N? Position 5 is A? But N eliminated? So not.
- MAFIA? M(1), A(2), F(3), I(4), A(5)? Then yes? F is new? And A at position 5? We know A is fixed at position 2? But there can be duplicate A? We haven't ruled that. However, N? No, MAFIA has no N? Letters: M, A, F, I, A? Positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:F, 4:I, 5:A. But eliminated? S,U,D? Not here? And available? M and F allowed? Also, no eliminated letters.

MAFIA is a word? Yes.

Other words:
- ""RABBI""? But R eliminated? Not?
- ""TABI""? Not 5 letters? TABI is 4.
- ""WACKY""? No I? Must have I at position 4.
- ""TAXIS""? T eliminated? And X? Not?
- ""CABIN""? C eliminated? Not?
- ""HAVIO""? But V,I,O? Yet: H(1), A(2), V(3), I(4), O(5)? So H A V I O? Which is HAVIO? Is that a word? Not commonly? But HAVENO? Not.

""MAFIA"" uses M, F, I, and A? And positions: M(1), A(2), F(3), I(4), A(5). So it has A at position 5? But in the secret word, since A is fixed at position 2, a second A at position 5 is possible? From feedback, we know A is at position 2? And if there is an extra A? The feedback doesn't rule out multiple A's? For example, in Guess 3: SAUDI has only one A? But that doesn't disprove multiple.

Another word: ""BABI"" with S? ""BABEL""? E eliminated? Not?
""BAJRI""? Not common?
""BACCHUS""? Too long?

I think MAFIA is a valid option? Also words like ""PANIC""? P(1), A(2), N(3), I(4), C(5)? But N and C eliminated? Not.

Another word: ""PACIF""? Not? ""PATIO""? T? Eliminated? Not.

""MAJIK""? M(1), A(2), J(3), I(4), K(5)? MAJIK is a word? Like majik? Or variant? But let's stick to common words.

""OBIAS""? O B I A S? S eliminated? Not?

But MAFIA seems reasonable? Available letters? M, F, I, A? And I would be at position 4? Position 5: A? So pattern: [1]A[3]I[5] with 1:M, 3:F, 5:A? Then word: M A F I A.

Also, think of: ""MACHO""? But C,H? C eliminated? Not.

Therefore, we have candidate MAFIA? But note: position 1 is M? Position 3 is F? Position 5 is A? And position 4 is I.

But we know the word must have exactly the letters? And MAFIA has two A's? That's fine? Since A can be repeated? Or not? We don't know? But possible.

To test if I is at position 4? And if there is an A at position 5? Or what?

We can guess MAFIA? But also, we need to consider if our case is wrong? What if I is at position 1? Then MAFIA would not fit? Because MAFIA has I at position 4? And no I at position 1.

But actually, we are guessing based on the pattern? So if the secret word is MAFIA, then it would be correct? If not, we get feedback.

But let me think of another word with I at position 4? And position 1? Not M? Other letters.

For example: ""HAIKU""? H(1), A(2), I? Not? Position? H A I K U? That's H-A-I-K-U? I is at position 3? Which we know I is not at position 3? Because from Guess2? So cannot use I at position 3? We must avoid putting I at position 3.

HAIKU has I at position 3? Not acceptable? Because I cannot be at position 3? So unusable.

Another word: ""FAITH""? But T,H? T eliminated? Not.

""DAILY""? But D and L eliminated? Not.

""WAIFT""? W,A,I,F,T? T eliminated? Not.

""PAIVS""? Not a word.

So MAFIA seems a practical guess? Or try ""MANIA""? But N eliminated? Not possible? Earlier we thought? M A N I A? N eliminated? So no.

Another candidate: ""KAFIR""? K(1),A(2),F(3),I(4),R(5)? But R eliminated? Cannot.

""QADAR""? Not word.

Therefore, let's stick with MAFIA? But note: MAFIA has I at position 4? Which matches Case 2? And A at position 5? So we are guessing that? If the secret word has I at position 4? We get confirmation or not.

Alternatively, we can design a guess that tests both cases? For example, include both position 1 and position 4 possibilities? But that would require I at position 1 and I at position 4? Then we have double I? Like ""MAFII""? Not valid.

So we need to choose a pattern? MAFIA seems a word? And it uses M and F? Which are common? Also, we have not tested them.

But notice: in MAFIA, position 5 is A? But in Guess 3, we had SAUDI with I at position 5? Which was '-' meaning I is not at position 5? But if we now have A at position 5? That's not I? So that's fine? Because I is not at position 5? We are putting A at position 5? That's not I.

Position 5: A? So we are not guessing I there? That's fine? Because our guess MAFIA will have:
- M: position 1? Not known
- A: position 2? We know correct? So ✓
- F: position 3? Not known
- I: position 4? If I is indeed at position 4? Then ✓ for I at position 4? If not, then '-' meaning I is elsewhere? Or if our case is wrong, perhaps I is at position 1? Then I at position 4 would be '-'? And we'll learn? Also, position 5: A? Which we know there is at least one A? But already at position 2, so if there is an extra A, it could be? Or feedback might be '-' if another A elsewhere? Or 'x' if no extra A? But we don't know if there is an extra A?

Therefore, let's propose ""MAFIA"" as the guess.

But wait: we must confirm the word? MAFIA is valid? Yes.

Also, feedback potential:

- If MAFIA is correct, we win?
- If not:
   - Position 2: A will be ✓? Always? Because confirmed.
   - Position 4: I, if the secret word has I at position 4? ✓? If not, '-' meaning I is elsewhere? Then we'll know I must be at position 1? Because no other.
   - Position 1: M? Feedback: if M in the word? How? Not tested before? So ✓, -, or x?
   - Similarly for F and the second A at position 5.

Case 1: the word has I at position 1? Then we don't expect I to be at position 4? So if we guess MAFIA, position 4 I would be '-' if I is elsewhere? Or perhaps no? Since we have guessed I at position 4, and if I is at position 1, then the feedback for position 4 I would be ""x"" if there is no I at position 4? Actually, no? We know there is one I? Then if we put I at position 4 and it's really at position 1? Then the feedback would be '-'? Because the letter I is in the word? But not at position 4? Since we know only one I? Then '-' for position 4 I? And then position 1 M must be something else? Perhaps we'll see.

But regardless, after this guess? We'll narrow it.

But to maximize? Perhaps we need a word that forces distinction? Or just guess MAFIA.

Another candidate: ""BAKER""? But E and R eliminated? No.

Or ""FIBER""? E,R eliminated? Not.

So I think ""MAFIA"" is passable.

Therefore, guess ""MAFIA"".

But let's be systematic: From Guess 3, A at position 2 is fixed? And I is at either position 1 or position 4.

If I is at position 1, we don't know a word? That seems unlikely? Because we searched? Maybe I missed?

Possible word with I at 1: ""IAMBS""? not? ""IAWIS""? not? ""ICHOR""? C and R gone? ""IKONS""? K O N S? N and S eliminated? No? ""ILIAD""? L and D eliminated? No? ""IODID""? D gone? ""IVIED""? D gone? ""ONIUM""? O N I U M? But not I at beginning? Etc.

So Case 1 is likely not occurring? So Case 2 is probable? I at position 4.

Then we complete positions 1,3,5.

MAFIA assumes M at1, F at3, A at5? But A at5 is additional? We don't know if required.

We could guess a word without duplicate A? For example: ""PAPIO""? P A P I O? But O? And P repeated? Not? ""BABIO""? B A B I O? Similar? Avoid duplicates? Since we don't know if duplicate A.

But MAFIA uses the letters MAFIA? Which includes A twice? But could be.

Another word: ""JAVAI""? Not? ""KAPAS""? Not? Perhaps ""MAFIO""? Not? So few options.

Therefore, we'll go with MAFIA? Or another word with I at position 4? Like ""MAPSI""? Not? ""MARIA""? But R eliminated? No? ""BANYA""? B A N Y A? N eliminated? No? So MAFIA remains.

Guess: MAFIA

Done.### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Eliminated Letters**: All guesses confirm that the following letters are **not** in the secret word due to ""x"" feedback:  
  - Guess 1: C, R, T, E  
  - Guess 2: L, G, N  
  - Guess 3: S, U, D  
  Combined eliminated letters: **C, R, T, E, L, G, N, S, U, D**  

- **Confirmed Letter Positon**:  
  - From Guess 3: **A(✓) at position 2** → The secret word has **A** as the second letter: `_ A _ _ _`  

- **Misplaced Letters** (present but wrong position):  
  - **A** was misplaced in positions 1 (Guess 2) and 3 (Guess 1).  
  - **I** is in the word but misplaced in positions 3 (Guess 2) and 5 (Guess 3). Given positions 2 (A), 3, and 5 are invalid for I, it must be in **position 1 or 4**.  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- The secret word format is: `[position1] A [position3] [position4] [position5]`.  
- **Position 1/4 must contain I** (since I is confirmed and only positions 1/4 are plausible).  
- Remaining positions (3, and 5/position1/position4 depending on I) must be filled with letter not eliminated.  
- Focus on testing positions for **I** while introducing new letters:  
  - **Option 1**: Guess a word where I is in position 1 (e.g., `I A _ _ _`). However, few valid English words fit this pattern after eliminations (e.g., ""IAMBS"" invalid).  
  - **Option 2**: Guess a word where I is in position 4 (e.g., `_ A _ I _`). More feasible.  
- Selecting **""MAFIA""** for Guess 4:  
  - Tests **I in position 4** (if I is here, ✓; if not, I must be in position 1).  
  - **M, F** are new untested letters (common consonants).  
  - Ends with **A** at position 5 (could be duplicate; tested implicitly).  
  - Avoids eliminated letters and aligns with word pattern.

### Expected Feedback Insights
- If **I(✓)** at position 4, I is confirmed.  
- If **I(-)** at position 4, I must be in position 1 (only remaining option).  
- **A** at position 5 tests for duplicate A presence.",Guess 4: MAFIA -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) F(✓) I(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
