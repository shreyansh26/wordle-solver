We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have:
 - Five distinct letters to cover as many different letters as possible.
 - Common letters (vowels and frequent consonants) to increase the chance of matching some letters.

 Some popular starting words are: ROATE, ADIEU, CRANE, SLATE, etc.

 Let's choose a word with two vowels and three common consonants. I'll choose ""CRANE"": 
   C, R, A, N, E

 This uses common letters and includes a variety.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also good: S, L, A, T, E.

 Since I am starting, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 First guess: CRANE

A strong starting word should:

- Use distinct letters to test more possibilities
- Consider vowel/consonant balance

Based on English letter frequency, common starting words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROATE"" are effective. I'll choose ""CRANE"" because:
- Contains frequently used letters (C, R, A, N, E)
- Has two vowels (A, E) and three consonants
- Letters appear in common positions (E often at end)
- Tests multiple critical letters early

This choice should provide meaningful feedback for subsequent guesses regardless of which symbols appear.

First, the previous guess was ""crane"" and the feedback was all ""x"", meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word. So, I need to avoid any word that contains these letters.

The secret word has none of: C, R, A, N, E. That means I have to use other letters from the alphabet.

Now, for my next guess, I want to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information. Since no letters from ""crane"" are present, I should choose another common word that avoids these letters entirely.

List the available letters: I need to use letters not in the set {C, R, A, N, E}. The English alphabet has 26 letters, so subtract those: C, R, A, N, E are removed.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (I think that's all).

Common vowels are important; I should include vowels. A and E are out, so remaining vowels are I, O, U. Y can sometimes act as a vowel, but I'll focus on I, O, U.

Consonants: I have plenty like S, T, L, etc., but need to avoid C,R,A,N,E.

Popular Wordle starters that don't use these letters: I need a new word.

Possible words: ""silly"", but I should think of high-frequency letters.

High-frequency letters in English include S, T, L, O, etc.

Try to form a word with available letters.

Good options:

- ""sight"": S, I, G, H, T – all letters not in forbidden set.

- ""ought"": O, U, G, H, T – similar.

- ""pound"": P, O, U, N, D – N is forbidden since feedback had N(x), so cannot use N.

In ""crane"", N got x, so N is not in the word. Similarly, E is out.

So, avoid C,R,A,N,E.

""pound"" has N? P,O,U,N,D – N is not allowed. Mistake.

""cloud"" has C? C is not allowed.

""light"": L,I,G,H,T – all good, L and T are common.

""fight"": F,I,G,H,T – F is not super common.

""might"": M,I,G,H,T – M is decent.

""south"": S,O,U,T,H – S,O,U,T,H all not forbidden.

Another one: ""built"" – B,U,I,L,T.

But I need to decide based on maximizing information.

Since no letters are hit, I want a word that uses frequent letters still available.

Available high-frequency letters: S (19th percentile?), wait, actual frequencies.

Standard English letter frequency:

E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... but E,T,A,O,I,N are top, but E,A,N,E are excluded (A and E and N are excluded), T,O,I are still available.

T is very common, O is common, I is common, S is common, H, L, etc.

So, words like ""toils"" or something.

My goal: test new vowels and common consonants.

Choose a word with O and I, since U is less common.

For example, ""point"": P,O,I,N,T – N is forbidden, cannot use.

N is out.

""foist"": F,O,I,S,T – S,T are common, F less so.

""joint"" has N.

""light"": L,I,G,H,T – L,I,T good, G and H are less frequent.

""ought"" is not a valid word; it's 5 letters?

""ought"": O,U,G,H,T – U is a vowel, all allowed.

But is ""ought"" a valid Wordle word? Probably not, as it might be considered archaic. Wordle uses common words.

Assume only valid dictionary words.

""audio"": A,U,D,I,O – A is forbidden.

""quilt"": Q,U,I,L,T – Q is rare.

Better to avoid rare letters.

""solid"": S,O,L,I,D – S,O,L,I,D – all letters available, and S,O,L,I,D are all good letters.

S,O,L,I,D – S is common, O common, L common, I common, D common. No forbidden letters.

Similarly, ""spoil"": S,P,O,I,L – but that's only 4 letters? S-P-O-I-L, spoil is 5 letters.

S,P,O,I,L. Spoil is S-P-O-I-L.

But ""spoil"" has S,P,O,I,L.

Or ""stomp"": S,T,O,M,P – S,T,O,M,P – M and P are less common, but okay.

To maximize coverage, since first gave no info, I should pick a word with entirely new letters.

""crane"" used C,R,A,N,E. So for second word, I can use S,O,L,I,D for example.

""solid"" seems good.

Other options: ""built"" – B,U,I,L,T – U is used.

""child"" – C,H,I,L,D – C is forbidden.

C is out.

""guild"" – G,U,I,L,D – G,U,I,L,D all allowed.

But U is a vowel, and G is consonant.

Perhaps better is ""pilot"": P,I,L,O,T – P,I,L,O,T – all good letters.

P,I,L,O,T.

Yes.

""toils"" – T,O,I,L,S – same letters.

""solid"", ""pilot"", etc.

I think ""pilot"" is a reasonable choice: P,I,L,O,T – tests I,O vowels, and L,T consonants.

Feedback will help narrow down.

After this guess, I'll get information about these letters.

So, I'll go with ""pilot"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback, the letters C, R, A, N, E are all not in the secret word, so they must be avoided in the next guess. I need to choose a new word that uses different letters to maximize information gain. Common vowels and consonants not yet tested include O, I, U, S, T, L, etc. A word like ""pilot"" (using P, I, L, O, T) is effective because:
- It avoids all forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E).
- It covers new high-frequency letters like O, I, T, and L.
- Testing I and O as vowels increases the chance of finding vowel positions.
- S is still unused but can be prioritized in future guesses if needed.

This feedback will help identify which letters are present and their positions.

E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... but E,T,A,O,I,N are top, but E,A,N,E are excluded (A and E and N are excluded), T,O,I are still available.

T is very common, O is common, I is common, S is common, H, L, etc.

So, words like ""toils"" or something.

My goal: test new vowels and common consonants.

Choose a word with O and I, since U is less common.

For example, ""point"": P,O,I,N,T – N is forbidden, cannot use.

N is out.

""foist"": F,O,I,S,T – S,T are common, F less so.

""joint"" has N.

""light"": L,I,G,H,T – L,I,T good, G and H are less frequent.

""ought"" is not a valid word; it's 5 letters?

""ought"": O,U,G,H,T – U is a vowel, all allowed.

But is ""ought"" a valid Wordle word? Probably not, as it might be considered archaic. Wordle uses common words.

Assume only valid dictionary words.

""audio"": A,U,D,I,O – A is forbidden.

""quilt"": Q,U,I,L,T – Q is rare.

Better to avoid rare letters.

""solid"": S,O,L,I,D – S,O,L,I,D – all letters available, and S,O,L,I,D are all good letters.

S,O,L,I,D – S is common, O common, L common, I common, D common. No forbidden letters.

Similarly, ""spoil"": S,P,O,I,L – but that's only 4 letters? S-P-O-I-L, spoil is 5 letters.

S,P,O,I,L. Spoil is S-P-O-I-L.

But ""spoil"" has S,P,O,I,L.

Or ""stomp"": S,T,O,M,P – S,T,O,M,P – M and P are less common, but okay.

To maximize coverage, since first gave no info, I should pick a word with entirely new letters.

""crane"" used C,R,A,N,E. So for second word, I can use S,O,L,I,D for example.

""solid"" seems good.

Other options: ""built"" – B,U,I,L,T – U is used.

""child"" – C,H,I,L,D – C is forbidden.

C is out.

""guild"" – G,U,I,L,D – G,U,I,L,D all allowed.

But U is a vowel, and G is consonant.

Perhaps better is ""pilot"": P,I,L,O,T – P,I,L,O,T – all good letters.

P,I,L,O,T.

Yes.

""toils"" – T,O,I,L,S – same letters.

""solid"", ""pilot"", etc.

I think ""pilot"" is a reasonable choice: P,I,L,O,T – tests I,O vowels, and L,T consonants.

Feedback will help narrow down.

After this guess, I'll get information about these letters.

So, I'll go with ""pilot"".Based on the previous feedback, the letters C, R, A, N, E are all not in the secret word, so they must be avoided in the next guess. I need to choose a new word that uses different letters to maximize information gain. Common vowels and consonants not yet tested include O, I, U, S, T, L, etc. A word like ""pilot"" (using P, I, L, O, T) is effective because:
- It avoids all forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E).
- It covers new high-frequency letters like O, I, T, and L.
- Testing I and O as vowels increases the chance of finding vowel positions.
- S is still unused but can be prioritized in future guesses if needed.

This feedback will help identify which letters are present and their positions.

We have two guesses:
1. ""crane"" was all C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x) -> meaning none of these letters are in the secret word.
   So, we must avoid C, R, A, N, E.

2. ""pilot"" was P(x) I(x) L(x) O(x) T(-) -> 
   P, I, L, O are all not in the word (since marked x).
   T is in the word but in the wrong position (marked -).

Important deductions:
- From Guess 2: T is in the secret word, but not in the last position (since the T in ""pilot"" was the last letter and got - meaning it's not in that position).
- Also, the word cannot contain P, I, L, O.

Now, we know the secret word contains T, and excludes:
  C, R, A, N, E, P, I, L, O.

Letters we have used: C, R, A, N, E, P, I, L, O, T.

But T is in the word, so for our next guess, we must include T and avoid the excluded letters.

We also know T is not at the end (position 5).

Possible positions for T: 1,2,3,4.

We need to form a five-letter word with T that is not at position 5, and using only letters not in the forbidden set.

Forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, I, L, O.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Also, we must include T (since we know it's in the word).

Now, T must be in our guess, but not at position 5.

We also want to test new letters to gain more information. Since T is the only letter we know is present, we should use other high-frequency letters that haven't been tested.

Common letters still available: S, U, D, G, H, B, Y, M, etc.

We can try to use S, U, H, which are common.

We need a word that:
- Contains T (but not at position 5)
- Uses letters from: B,D,F,G,H,K,M,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z
- And is a valid English word.

Options:

Position of T: We want to place T in possible positions 1,2,3 to test.

For example:
- If we put T at start: e.g., ""T????""
- Or middle: ""?T???""

But we only have 5 positions.

We also want vowels: Only U and Y are available as vowels (and sometimes W,Y, but vowel sounds needed). U is a vowel.

So, having U in the word might be helpful.

Possible words:

- ""trust"" -> but T forbidden? No, T is allowed and required. But trust contains R and T? R is forbidden (from guess1 R(x)). So no R.

Avoid forbidden letters: R is excluded.

Another: ""study"" -> S,T,U,D,Y. Positions: S1, T2, U3, D4, Y5. This has T at position 2, which is not 5, so avoids T at end. And letters: S,T,U,D,Y - all allowed? S yes (not used), T yes, U yes, D yes, Y yes.

Is ""study"" a valid word? Yes.

But we need to check if these letters are available: U and D are in the available list.

Another possibility: ""stump"" - but S,T,U,M,P? P is forbidden? From guess2 P(x), so P cannot be used.

So ""study"" seems acceptable.

Another: ""thump"" but H,U,M,P - P forbidden.

""tough"" - O,U,G,H,T? O is forbidden (guess2 O(x)), so cannot.

""fight"" - F,I,G,H,T? I is forbidden (guess2 I(x)), and I cannot be used.

So better options:

- ""study"": S,T,U,D,Y

We could try to cover more consonants.

""musty"" - M,U,S,T,Y? T at position 4? Position: M1, U2, S3, T4, Y5. T is at 4, not 5? It's not 5? Position 4 is allowed since only position 5 was wrong originally for T. Wait, no: in guess2, T was at position 5 and got '-', meaning T is in word but not at position 5. So T could be at positions 1,2,3,4.

So ""musty"" has T at 4, which is fine.

But ""musty"" uses M,U,S,T,Y.

Both ""study"" and ""musty"" are possible.

But ""musty"" might be less common, and uses M which is less frequent.

I think ""study"" is a solid choice.

Another common one: ""dusty"" - D,U,S,T,Y? Has T at position 4? D1, U2, S3, T4, Y5.

T again at position 4.

We want to test a different position for T to see if we can get a '-'.

If we put T at front: e.g., ""t? ? ? ?"", we need words starting with T.

For example, ""tusks"" - T,U,S,K,S? But repeated S? And K is allowed? T1,U2,S3,K4,S5? No, it has two S's. Not efficient.

""tucks"" - C? C forbidden.

""tough"" O forbidden.

""tubby"" U,B,B,Y? B twice? Not good.

""tubed"" E forbidden? E excluded.

So words with T at start: tough to find without forbidden letters.

""thank"" - A forbidden, N forbidden.

No.

""think"" - I forbidden? Guess2 I(x), so I is excluded.

So T at front might be difficult.

T at position 2: like ?T??

For example:
- ""study"" -> T at position2

Also ""sting"" - but I and N forbidden? N from guess1, no. N excluded. ""sting"" has N? S,T,I,N,G? I and N forbidden? Guess1: N(x), Guess2: I(x), so excluded.

Not valid.

Another: ""stick"" - C? C forbidden.

""stunk"" - U,N,K? N forbidden.

So ""study"" seems a good option.

We can test S,U,D,Y,T.

T is at position2.

Feedback will tell us about these letters.

Also, note we haven't tested many letters: so this guess will cover S,U,D,Y,T.

T is already known to be present, so we'll learn about the others.

So I choose ""study"".

But let's confirm: in ""study"", T is at position2. Previously, T was at position5 and was wrong. So position2 might be correct or wrong.

We'll see.

If we get new 'x' for some, we exclude those letters.

If we get '-' or '✓', we include.

So, guess: study<thinking>
Previous feedback:
- Guess1 ""crane"" had all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E not in word).
- Guess2 ""pilot"" had P, I, L, O absent and T present but wrong position (so T is in word but not at position 5).

Therefore:
- Forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, I, L, O.
- Known present letter: T, with position 5 ruled out.

Next guess must:
- Include T (as it's confirmed present)
- Avoid all forbidden letters
- Place T in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 to test other locations
- Introduce new high-frequency letters from available set: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

""study"" (S,T,U,D,Y) fits well because:
- Contains T at position 2 (testing a new slot)
- Uses common vowels U and consonant S, D, Y
- All letters are untested and available
- Word is valid and common
</thinking>

<guess>study</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters marked as absent, so C, R, A, N, E are **not** in the secret word.
- ""pilot"" had P, I, L, O marked as absent and T marked as present but in the wrong position. This means:
  - T is **in the secret word** but **not at position 5**.
  - P, I, L, O are **not in the word**.

For the next guess:
- Must include **T** (since it is confirmed present), but not in position 5.
- Must avoid C, R, A, N, E, P, I, L, O (all marked absent).
- Use new high-frequency letters to maximize information gain, focusing on available consonants and vowels (U, Y).

""study"" is an optimal choice because:
- It includes T at position 2 (testing a new position).
- It introduces S, U, D, and Y—all untested letters.
- U provides vowel coverage, S and D are common consonants.
- The word is valid and avoids all forbidden letters.

This guess will help identify which of these new letters are present and their positions.
<thinking>
The feedback from ""study"" will clarify:
- If T is correctly placed at position 2 (possible ✓)
- If U or Y act as vowels in the word
- Any new absent letters to further narrow the pool

<guess>study</guess>",study,"We have two guesses:
1. ""crane"" was all C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x) -> meaning none of these letters are in the secret word.

Is ""study"" a valid word? Yes.

But we need to check if these letters are available: U and D are in the available list.

Another possibility: ""stump"" - but S,T,U,M,P? P is forbidden? From guess2 P(x), so P cannot be used.

So ""study"" seems acceptable.

Another: ""thump"" but H,U,M,P - P forbidden.

""tough"" - O,U,G,H,T? O is forbidden (guess2 O(x)), so cannot.

""fight"" - F,I,G,H,T? I is forbidden (guess2 I(x)), and I cannot be used.

So better options:

- ""study"": S,T,U,D,Y

We could try to cover more consonants.

""musty"" - M,U,S,T,Y? T at position 4? Position: M1, U2, S3, T4, Y5. T is at 4, not 5? It's not 5? Position 4 is allowed since only position 5 was wrong originally for T. Wait, no: in guess2, T was at position 5 and got '-', meaning T is in word but not at position 5. So T could be at positions 1,2,3,4.

So ""musty"" has T at 4, which is fine.

But ""musty"" uses M,U,S,T,Y.

Both ""study"" and ""musty"" are possible.

But ""musty"" might be less common, and uses M which is less frequent.

I think ""study"" is a solid choice.

Another common one: ""dusty"" - D,U,S,T,Y? Has T at position 4? D1, U2, S3, T4, Y5.

T again at position 4.

We want to test a different position for T to see if we can get a '-'.

""tucks"" - C? C forbidden.

""tough"" O forbidden.

""tubby"" U,B,B,Y? B twice? Not good.

""tubed"" E forbidden? E excluded.

So words with T at start: tough to find without forbidden letters.

""thank"" - A forbidden, N forbidden.

No.

""think"" - I forbidden? Guess2 I(x), so I is excluded.

So T at front might be difficult.

T at position 2: like ?T??

Also ""sting"" - but I and N forbidden? N from guess1, no. N excluded. ""sting"" has N? S,T,I,N,G? I and N forbidden? Guess1: N(x), Guess2: I(x), so excluded.

Not valid.

Another: ""stick"" - C? C forbidden.

""stunk"" - U,N,K? N forbidden.

So ""study"" seems a good option.

We can test S,U,D,Y,T.

T is at position2.

Also, note we haven't tested many letters: so this guess will cover S,U,D,Y,T.

T is already known to be present, so we'll learn about the others.

If we get new 'x' for some, we exclude those letters.

If we get '-' or '✓', we include.

So, guess: study<thinking>
Previous feedback:
- Guess1 ""crane"" had all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E not in word).
- Guess2 ""pilot"" had P, I, L, O absent and T present but wrong position (so T is in word but not at position 5).

Therefore:
- Forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, I, L, O.
- Known present letter: T, with position 5 ruled out.

Next guess must:
- Include T (as it's confirmed present)
- Avoid all forbidden letters
- Place T in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 to test other locations
- Introduce new high-frequency letters from available set: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

""study"" (S,T,U,D,Y) fits well because:
- Contains T at position 2 (testing a new slot)
- Uses common vowels U and consonant S, D, Y
- All letters are untested and available
- Word is valid and common
</thinking>

<guess>study</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters marked as absent, so C, R, A, N, E are **not** in the secret word.
- ""pilot"" had P, I, L, O marked as absent and T marked as present but in the wrong position. This means:
  - T is **in the secret word** but **not at position 5**.
  - P, I, L, O are **not in the word**.

For the next guess:
- Must include **T** (since it is confirmed present), but not in position 5.
- Must avoid C, R, A, N, E, P, I, L, O (all marked absent).
- Use new high-frequency letters to maximize information gain, focusing on available consonants and vowels (U, Y).

""study"" is an optimal choice because:
- It includes T at position 2 (testing a new position).
- It introduces S, U, D, and Y—all untested letters.
- U provides vowel coverage, S and D are common consonants.
- The word is valid and avoids all forbidden letters.

This guess will help identify which of these new letters are present and their positions.
<thinking>
The feedback from ""study"" will clarify:
- If T is correctly placed at position 2 (possible ✓)
- If U or Y act as vowels in the word
- Any new absent letters to further narrow the pool

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have:
 - Five distinct letters to cover as many different letters as possible.
 - Common letters (vowels and frequent consonants) to increase the chance of matching some letters.

 Some popular starting words are: ROATE, ADIEU, CRANE, SLATE, etc.

 Let's choose a word with two vowels and three common consonants. I'll choose ""CRANE"": 
   C, R, A, N, E

 This uses common letters and includes a variety.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also good: S, L, A, T, E.

 Since I am starting, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 First guess: CRANE<thinking>
I'm making the first guess in Wordle with no prior information. My goal is to maximize information by choosing a word with common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants. 

A strong starting word should:
- Cover frequent letters to increase hit chances
- Use distinct letters to test more possibilities
- Consider vowel/consonant balance

Based on English letter frequency, common starting words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROATE"" are effective. I'll choose ""CRANE"" because:
- Contains frequently used letters (C, R, A, N, E)
- Has two vowels (A, E) and three consonants
- Letters appear in common positions (E often at end)
- Tests multiple critical letters early

This choice should provide meaningful feedback for subsequent guesses regardless of which symbols appear.
</thinking>

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>First, the previous guess was ""crane"" and the feedback was all ""x"", meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word. So, I need to avoid any word that contains these letters.

The secret word has none of: C, R, A, N, E. That means I have to use other letters from the alphabet.

Now, for my next guess, I want to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information. Since no letters from ""crane"" are present, I should choose another common word that avoids these letters entirely.

List the available letters: I need to use letters not in the set {C, R, A, N, E}. The English alphabet has 26 letters, so subtract those: C, R, A, N, E are removed.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (I think that's all).

Common vowels are important; I should include vowels. A and E are out, so remaining vowels are I, O, U. Y can sometimes act as a vowel, but I'll focus on I, O, U.

Consonants: I have plenty like S, T, L, etc., but need to avoid C,R,A,N,E.

Popular Wordle starters that don't use these letters: I need a new word.

Possible words: ""silly"", but I should think of high-frequency letters.

High-frequency letters in English include S, T, L, O, etc.

Try to form a word with available letters.

Good options:

- ""sight"": S, I, G, H, T – all letters not in forbidden set.

- ""ought"": O, U, G, H, T – similar.

- ""pound"": P, O, U, N, D – N is forbidden since feedback had N(x), so cannot use N.

In ""crane"", N got x, so N is not in the word. Similarly, E is out.

So, avoid C,R,A,N,E.

""pound"" has N? P,O,U,N,D – N is not allowed. Mistake.

""cloud"" has C? C is not allowed.

""light"": L,I,G,H,T – all good, L and T are common.

""fight"": F,I,G,H,T – F is not super common.

""might"": M,I,G,H,T – M is decent.

""south"": S,O,U,T,H – S,O,U,T,H all not forbidden.

Another one: ""built"" – B,U,I,L,T.

But I need to decide based on maximizing information.

Since no letters are hit, I want a word that uses frequent letters still available.

Available high-frequency letters: S (19th percentile?), wait, actual frequencies.

Standard English letter frequency:

E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... but E,T,A,O,I,N are top, but E,A,N,E are excluded (A and E and N are excluded), T,O,I are still available.

T is very common, O is common, I is common, S is common, H, L, etc.

So, words like ""toils"" or something.

My goal: test new vowels and common consonants.

Choose a word with O and I, since U is less common.

For example, ""point"": P,O,I,N,T – N is forbidden, cannot use.

N is out.

""foist"": F,O,I,S,T – S,T are common, F less so.

""joint"" has N.

""light"": L,I,G,H,T – L,I,T good, G and H are less frequent.

""ought"" is not a valid word; it's 5 letters?

""ought"": O,U,G,H,T – U is a vowel, all allowed.

But is ""ought"" a valid Wordle word? Probably not, as it might be considered archaic. Wordle uses common words.

Assume only valid dictionary words.

""audio"": A,U,D,I,O – A is forbidden.

""quilt"": Q,U,I,L,T – Q is rare.

Better to avoid rare letters.

""solid"": S,O,L,I,D – S,O,L,I,D – all letters available, and S,O,L,I,D are all good letters.

S,O,L,I,D – S is common, O common, L common, I common, D common. No forbidden letters.

Similarly, ""spoil"": S,P,O,I,L – but that's only 4 letters? S-P-O-I-L, spoil is 5 letters.

S,P,O,I,L. Spoil is S-P-O-I-L.

But ""spoil"" has S,P,O,I,L.

Or ""stomp"": S,T,O,M,P – S,T,O,M,P – M and P are less common, but okay.

To maximize coverage, since first gave no info, I should pick a word with entirely new letters.

""crane"" used C,R,A,N,E. So for second word, I can use S,O,L,I,D for example.

""solid"" seems good.

Other options: ""built"" – B,U,I,L,T – U is used.

""child"" – C,H,I,L,D – C is forbidden.

C is out.

""guild"" – G,U,I,L,D – G,U,I,L,D all allowed.

But U is a vowel, and G is consonant.

Perhaps better is ""pilot"": P,I,L,O,T – P,I,L,O,T – all good letters.

P,I,L,O,T.

Yes.

""toils"" – T,O,I,L,S – same letters.

""solid"", ""pilot"", etc.

I think ""pilot"" is a reasonable choice: P,I,L,O,T – tests I,O vowels, and L,T consonants.

Feedback will help narrow down.

After this guess, I'll get information about these letters.

So, I'll go with ""pilot"".Based on the previous feedback, the letters C, R, A, N, E are all not in the secret word, so they must be avoided in the next guess. I need to choose a new word that uses different letters to maximize information gain. Common vowels and consonants not yet tested include O, I, U, S, T, L, etc. A word like ""pilot"" (using P, I, L, O, T) is effective because:
- It avoids all forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E).
- It covers new high-frequency letters like O, I, T, and L.
- Testing I and O as vowels increases the chance of finding vowel positions.
- S is still unused but can be prioritized in future guesses if needed.

This feedback will help identify which letters are present and their positions.

<guess>pilot</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: pilot -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(x) L(x) O(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses:
1. ""crane"" was all C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x) -> meaning none of these letters are in the secret word.
   So, we must avoid C, R, A, N, E.

2. ""pilot"" was P(x) I(x) L(x) O(x) T(-) -> 
   P, I, L, O are all not in the word (since marked x).
   T is in the word but in the wrong position (marked -).

Important deductions:
- From Guess 2: T is in the secret word, but not in the last position (since the T in ""pilot"" was the last letter and got - meaning it's not in that position).
- Also, the word cannot contain P, I, L, O.

Now, we know the secret word contains T, and excludes:
  C, R, A, N, E, P, I, L, O.

Letters we have used: C, R, A, N, E, P, I, L, O, T.

But T is in the word, so for our next guess, we must include T and avoid the excluded letters.

We also know T is not at the end (position 5).

Possible positions for T: 1,2,3,4.

We need to form a five-letter word with T that is not at position 5, and using only letters not in the forbidden set.

Forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, I, L, O.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Also, we must include T (since we know it's in the word).

Now, T must be in our guess, but not at position 5.

We also want to test new letters to gain more information. Since T is the only letter we know is present, we should use other high-frequency letters that haven't been tested.

Common letters still available: S, U, D, G, H, B, Y, M, etc.

We can try to use S, U, H, which are common.

We need a word that:
- Contains T (but not at position 5)
- Uses letters from: B,D,F,G,H,K,M,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z
- And is a valid English word.

Options:

Position of T: We want to place T in possible positions 1,2,3 to test.

For example:
- If we put T at start: e.g., ""T????""
- Or middle: ""?T???""

But we only have 5 positions.

We also want vowels: Only U and Y are available as vowels (and sometimes W,Y, but vowel sounds needed). U is a vowel.

So, having U in the word might be helpful.

Possible words:

- ""trust"" -> but T forbidden? No, T is allowed and required. But trust contains R and T? R is forbidden (from guess1 R(x)). So no R.

Avoid forbidden letters: R is excluded.

Another: ""study"" -> S,T,U,D,Y. Positions: S1, T2, U3, D4, Y5. This has T at position 2, which is not 5, so avoids T at end. And letters: S,T,U,D,Y - all allowed? S yes (not used), T yes, U yes, D yes, Y yes.

Is ""study"" a valid word? Yes.

But we need to check if these letters are available: U and D are in the available list.

Another possibility: ""stump"" - but S,T,U,M,P? P is forbidden? From guess2 P(x), so P cannot be used.

So ""study"" seems acceptable.

Another: ""thump"" but H,U,M,P - P forbidden.

""tough"" - O,U,G,H,T? O is forbidden (guess2 O(x)), so cannot.

""fight"" - F,I,G,H,T? I is forbidden (guess2 I(x)), and I cannot be used.

So better options:

- ""study"": S,T,U,D,Y

We could try to cover more consonants.

""musty"" - M,U,S,T,Y? T at position 4? Position: M1, U2, S3, T4, Y5. T is at 4, not 5? It's not 5? Position 4 is allowed since only position 5 was wrong originally for T. Wait, no: in guess2, T was at position 5 and got '-', meaning T is in word but not at position 5. So T could be at positions 1,2,3,4.

So ""musty"" has T at 4, which is fine.

But ""musty"" uses M,U,S,T,Y.

Both ""study"" and ""musty"" are possible.

But ""musty"" might be less common, and uses M which is less frequent.

I think ""study"" is a solid choice.

Another common one: ""dusty"" - D,U,S,T,Y? Has T at position 4? D1, U2, S3, T4, Y5.

T again at position 4.

We want to test a different position for T to see if we can get a '-'.

If we put T at front: e.g., ""t? ? ? ?"", we need words starting with T.

For example, ""tusks"" - T,U,S,K,S? But repeated S? And K is allowed? T1,U2,S3,K4,S5? No, it has two S's. Not efficient.

""tucks"" - C? C forbidden.

""tough"" O forbidden.

""tubby"" U,B,B,Y? B twice? Not good.

""tubed"" E forbidden? E excluded.

So words with T at start: tough to find without forbidden letters.

""thank"" - A forbidden, N forbidden.

No.

""think"" - I forbidden? Guess2 I(x), so I is excluded.

So T at front might be difficult.

T at position 2: like ?T??

For example:
- ""study"" -> T at position2

Also ""sting"" - but I and N forbidden? N from guess1, no. N excluded. ""sting"" has N? S,T,I,N,G? I and N forbidden? Guess1: N(x), Guess2: I(x), so excluded.

Not valid.

Another: ""stick"" - C? C forbidden.

""stunk"" - U,N,K? N forbidden.

So ""study"" seems a good option.

We can test S,U,D,Y,T.

T is at position2.

Feedback will tell us about these letters.

Also, note we haven't tested many letters: so this guess will cover S,U,D,Y,T.

T is already known to be present, so we'll learn about the others.

So I choose ""study"".

But let's confirm: in ""study"", T is at position2. Previously, T was at position5 and was wrong. So position2 might be correct or wrong.

We'll see.

If we get new 'x' for some, we exclude those letters.

If we get '-' or '✓', we include.

So, guess: study<thinking>
Previous feedback:
- Guess1 ""crane"" had all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E not in word).
- Guess2 ""pilot"" had P, I, L, O absent and T present but wrong position (so T is in word but not at position 5).

Therefore:
- Forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, I, L, O.
- Known present letter: T, with position 5 ruled out.

Next guess must:
- Include T (as it's confirmed present)
- Avoid all forbidden letters
- Place T in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 to test other locations
- Introduce new high-frequency letters from available set: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

""study"" (S,T,U,D,Y) fits well because:
- Contains T at position 2 (testing a new slot)
- Uses common vowels U and consonant S, D, Y
- All letters are untested and available
- Word is valid and common
</thinking>

<guess>study</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters marked as absent, so C, R, A, N, E are **not** in the secret word.
- ""pilot"" had P, I, L, O marked as absent and T marked as present but in the wrong position. This means:
  - T is **in the secret word** but **not at position 5**.
  - P, I, L, O are **not in the word**.

For the next guess:
- Must include **T** (since it is confirmed present), but not in position 5.
- Must avoid C, R, A, N, E, P, I, L, O (all marked absent).
- Use new high-frequency letters to maximize information gain, focusing on available consonants and vowels (U, Y).

""study"" is an optimal choice because:
- It includes T at position 2 (testing a new position).
- It introduces S, U, D, and Y—all untested letters.

I need to choose a new word that uses different letters to maximize information gain. Common vowels and consonants not yet tested include O, I, U, S, T, L, etc. A word like ""pilot"" (using P, I, L, O, T) is effective because:\n- It avoids all forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E).\n- It covers new high-frequency letters like O, I, T, and L.\n- Testing I and O as vowels increases the chance of finding vowel positions.\n- S is still unused but can be prioritized in future guesses if needed.\n\nThis feedback will help identify which letters are present and their positions.\n\n<guess>pilot</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: pilot -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(x) L(x) O(x) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses:\n1.

U is a vowel.\n\nSo, having U in the word might be helpful.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""trust"" -> but T forbidden? No, T is allowed and required. But trust contains R and T? R is forbidden (from guess1 R(x)). So no R.\n\nAvoid forbidden letters: R is excluded.\n\nAnother: ""study"" -> S,T,U,D,Y. Positions: S1, T2, U3, D4, Y5.

Position: M1, U2, S3, T4, Y5. T is at 4, not 5? It\'s not 5? Position 4 is allowed since only position 5 was wrong originally for T. Wait, no: in guess2, T was at position 5 and got \'-\', meaning T is in word but not at position 5. So T could be at positions 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo ""musty"" has T at 4, which is fine.\n\nBut ""musty"" uses M,U,S,T,Y.\n\nBoth ""study"" and ""musty"" are possible.\n\nBut ""musty"" might be less common, and uses M which is less frequent.\n\nI think ""study"" is a solid choice.\n\nAnother common one: ""dusty"" - D,U,S,T,Y? Has T at position 4? D1, U2, S3, T4, Y5.\n\nT again at position 4.\n\nWe want to test a different position for T to see if we can get a \'-\'.\n\nIf we put T at front: e.g., ""t? ? ? ?"", we need words starting with T.\n\nFor example, ""tusks"" - T,U,S,K,S?

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x) 
Meaning: None of C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

Guess 2: pilot -> P(x), I(x), L(x), O(x), T(-)
Meaning: P, I, L, O are not in the word. T is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 3: study -> S(x), T(-), U(✓), D(x), Y(x)
Meaning:
- S and D and Y are not in the word.
- U is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since in ""study"" U is the third letter and got ✓).
- T is in the word but not in position 2 (since T is at position 2 and got -).

Summary so far:

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, I, L, O, S, D, Y
Present letters: T (but not position 2 or 5), U (at position 3)

Since we have U at position 3 confirmed, and T must be in the word but not in position 2 or 5.

Possible positions for T: position 1 or 4 (since position 3 is taken by U).

Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Position 3: U (fixed)

Position 2: we know T cannot be here (from Guess 3: T at position 2 got -)

Position 5: cannot be T (from Guess 2: T at position 5 got -, so not 5)

So T can only be at position 1 or 4.

Additionally, we need to form a word with U at position 3.

We must avoid all absent letters: C,R,A,N,E,P,I,L,O,S,D,Y

Available letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z (and T must be used)

Also, we have U fixed at position 3.

The word must be of the form:
- Position 3: U
- Position 1 and 4: one of them must be T (or possibly both? But not necessarily, but T must appear once).

Since T is only present once? We don't know if it can repeat, but until feedback shows multiple, we assume one instance.

So T must be at either position 1 or position 4.

We need to choose the remaining letters avoiding the forbidden list.

Forbidden letters: C,R,A,N,E,P,I,L,O,S,D,Y

Available: B,F,G,H,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Z, T (to be placed)

Now, let's try to form words.

Case 1: T at position 1
- Word: T _ U _ _
Case 2: T at position 4
- Word: _ _ U T _

We also need vowels? U is the only vowel known, and others are unavailable? Vowels: A,E,I,O are absent, only U is available, and Y is absent. So the word must have U at position 3, and possibly no other vowels? English words can have consonant clusters, but we need valid words.

For case 1: T _ U _ _
The letter at position 2 must be consonant? And position 4 and 5.

Possible words:
""tough"" - but O is absent, and G? Positions: T1 O2 U? No, O is forbidden.
""touch"" - C absent?
Not possible.

Try to find real words.

With available letters: B,F,G,H,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Z

For T _ U _ _

Possible words:
""thump"" - but H,U,M,P - P absent? P is forbidden. S and D absent, P also forbidden? From Guess 2, P(x) so forbidden. Yes.

Avoid P.

""quack"" - Q,U,A,C - A and C forbidden.

Hard.

Perhaps ""thumb"" - T,H,U,M,B? Letters: T,H,U,M,B

Check forbidden: H,M,B are not forbidden? Forbidden are C,R,A,N,E,P,I,L,O,S,D,Y. So H,M,B are available.

""thumb"" is a valid 5-letter word? Yes, THUMB.

Positions: T1, H2, U3, M4, B5

Now, we know T must be at position 1 or 4; here T is at 1, which is allowed.

U at position 3 is fixed.

We need to confirm if H,M,B are allowed - yes, not forbidden.

Similarly, case 2: T at position 4, e.g., _ _ U T _

Possible word: ""glut"" - but GLUT is 4 letters. Need 5.

""flute"" - F,L,U,T,E - L and E forbidden? L from Guess2 L(x), E from Guess1 E(x), so forbidden.

""brunt"" - B,R,U,N,T - R and N forbidden.

Not working.

Another: ""crust"" - C,R forbidden.

So ""thumb"" seems a good candidate.

Moreover, it uses H,M,B which are new letters.

We can also consider ""thunk"" - T,H,U,N,K? N forbidden? N from Guess1 N(x), so forbidden.

No.

""thugs"" - T,H,U,G,S - S forbidden? Guess3 S(x), so S absent.

Forbidden list: C,R,A,N,E,P,I,L,O,S,D,Y are all forbidden.

So ""thumb"" works.

Another option: ""truth"" - T,R,U,T,H? R forbidden and T repeated? But T might be possible, but R forbidden.

Not.

""tulip"" - L,I forbidden.

""buxom"" - B,U,X,O,M? O forbidden? Guess2 O(x), so absent.

Not.

The best is ""thumb"".

But let's see if there are others.

""quoth"" - Q,U,O,T,H? O forbidden.

Not.

""cumin"" - C,U,M,I,N? Multiple forbidden.

No.

So ""thumb"" seems viable.

Now, we have three positions: we are guessing T at position 1 which is possible, and hoping it might be correct or wrong position.

If we guess ""thumb"", feedback will tell us:
- If T at position 1 is correct (then ✓), or just present (-) if not.
- Similarly for H,U,M,B.

But U is already known position3 ✓, so position3 will be ✓.

Positions:
1: T -> we'll see feedback
2: H
3: U -> should be ✓ (since confirmed at position3)
4: M
5: B

We need to see if the secret word could be ""thumb"".

Before that, are there other words?

""tubed"" E forbidden.

""bugle"" U at position2? But U must be at position3.

No.

""fucus"" F,U,C,U,S? C,S forbidden and U repeated? Probably not, and U position not fixed.

But U must be at position3.

Another word: ""huffy""? H,U,F,F,Y? Y forbidden? Y from Guess3 Y(x), and also two F's? Not efficient.

""humps"" P,S forbidden.

""gulch"" L,C forbidden.

""munch"" N forbidden.

So ""thumb"" seems best.

But let's confirm the available letters.

Secret word must have U at position3, T at either 1 or 4.

For ""thumb"": T at position1, U at position3.

If we guess this, feedback might correct position of T.

But if T is actually at position4, then ""thumb"" might be wrong.

Is there a word with T at position4?

For example, _ _ U T _

Possible with available letters: B,F,G,H,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Z

Examples: 
""bruit"" - B,R,U,I,T? R and I forbidden? R from Guess1, I from Guess2.

""strut"" - S,R,U,T? S and R forbidden.

""clout"" C,L forbidden.

Not working.

""freut""? Not a word.

""fruit"" F,R,U,I,T? R and I forbidden.

No valid word with T at position4.

Another: ""wight"" W,I,G,H,T? I forbidden and T at position5 but T cannot be at5? Position of T in ""wight"" is at5? But we know T cannot be at5, so if T must be at4, but the fourth letter is H? ""wight"": W1,I2,G3,H4,T5? T at5? Position5 not allowed.

In words with U at3 and T at4: _ _ U T _

First two letters need consonants.

Example: ""about"" A,O forbidden.

""input"" I,P forbidden.

""strut"" forbidden.

Perhaps ""ought"" O forbidden? And T at4? ""ought"" has only4 letters? O-U-G-H-T? O1,U2? But U must be position3.

We need U at position3.

So the fourth letter is T.

""count"" O,U,N,T? O and N forbidden, U at2 not 3.

Not matching.

It appears that ""thumb"" is the only common word that fits the constraints.

Perhaps ""quoth"" but O forbidden.

Therefore, I'll go with ""thumb"".

But ""thumb"" has U at3, T at1.

If the secret word has T at4, we need to discover.

But since we have two positions possible and only one word candidate, we guess ""thumb"".

Another possibility: ""bhuto""? B,H,U,T,O? O forbidden.

Not.

So ""thumb"" it is.
</think>
Based on previous feedback:

**Excluded Letters** (marked ""x"" in all guesses): C, R, A, N, E, P, I, L, O, S, D, Y  
**Confirmed Knowledge**:
- U is in the secret word and correctly placed at **position 3** (✓ from ""study"").
- T is in the secret word but **not** in positions 2 or 5 (─ from ""pilot"" and ""study"").

Thus, T must be at position 1 or 4.  
Available letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z  

After exploring possible words that fit U at position 3 and T at 1 or 4 (while avoiding excluded letters), ""thumb"" emerges as a strong candidate:
- U is at position 3 (✓ already guaranteed).
- T is tested at position 1 (if wrong, it must be at position 4 for future guesses).
- New high-frequency letters H, M, B are introduced to gather more feedback.

<thinking>
**Word Analysis**:
- ""thumb"" = T1, H2, U3, M4, B5
- U3 is confirmed ✓.
- Position 1: Tests T at a new location.
- Positions 2, 4, 5: Test H, M, B (all untested consonants).
- Avoids all excluded letters.

If T is at position 1 (✓), it solves the word. If T is at position 4 (─), future guesses will target position 4 directly.

""fucus"" F,U,C,U,S? C,S forbidden and U repeated? Probably not, and U position not fixed.

But U must be at position3.

Another word: ""huffy""? H,U,F,F,Y? Y forbidden? Y from Guess3 Y(x), and also two F's? Not efficient.

""humps"" P,S forbidden.

""gulch"" L,C forbidden.

""munch"" N forbidden.

So ""thumb"" seems best.

But let's confirm the available letters.

Secret word must have U at position3, T at either 1 or 4.

For ""thumb"": T at position1, U at position3.

If we guess this, feedback might correct position of T.

But if T is actually at position4, then ""thumb"" might be wrong.

Is there a word with T at position4?

For example, _ _ U T _

Possible with available letters: B,F,G,H,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Z

Examples: 
""bruit"" - B,R,U,I,T? R and I forbidden? R from Guess1, I from Guess2.

""strut"" - S,R,U,T? S and R forbidden.

""clout"" C,L forbidden.

Not working.

""freut""? Not a word.

""fruit"" F,R,U,I,T? R and I forbidden.

No valid word with T at position4.

Another: ""wight"" W,I,G,H,T? I forbidden and T at position5 but T cannot be at5? Position of T in ""wight"" is at5? But we know T cannot be at5, so if T must be at4, but the fourth letter is H? ""wight"": W1,I2,G3,H4,T5? T at5? Position5 not allowed.

In words with U at3 and T at4: _ _ U T _

First two letters need consonants.

Example: ""about"" A,O forbidden.

""input"" I,P forbidden.

""strut"" forbidden.

Perhaps ""ought"" O forbidden? And T at4? ""ought"" has only4 letters? O-U-G-H-T? O1,U2? But U must be position3.

We need U at position3.

So the fourth letter is T.

""count"" O,U,N,T? O and N forbidden, U at2 not 3.

Not matching.

It appears that ""thumb"" is the only common word that fits the constraints.

Perhaps ""quoth"" but O forbidden.

Therefore, I'll go with ""thumb"".

But ""thumb"" has U at3, T at1.

If the secret word has T at4, we need to discover.

But since we have two positions possible and only one word candidate, we guess ""thumb"".

Another possibility: ""bhuto""? B,H,U,T,O? O forbidden.

Not.

So ""thumb"" it is.Based on previous feedback:

**Excluded Letters** (marked ""x"" in all guesses): C, R, A, N, E, P, I, L, O, S, D, Y  
**Confirmed Knowledge**:
- U is in the secret word and correctly placed at **position 3** (✓ from ""study"").
- T is in the secret word but **not** in positions 2 or 5 (─ from ""pilot"" and ""study"").

Thus, T must be at position 1 or 4.  
Available letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z  

After exploring possible words that fit U at position 3 and T at 1 or 4 (while avoiding excluded letters), ""thumb"" emerges as a strong candidate:
- U is at position 3 (✓ already guaranteed).
- T is tested at position 1 (if wrong, it must be at position 4 for future guesses).
- New high-frequency letters H, M, B are introduced to gather more feedback.

<thinking>
**Word Analysis**:
- ""thumb"" = T1, H2, U3, M4, B5
- U3 is confirmed ✓.
- Position 1: Tests T at a new location.
- Positions 2, 4, 5: Test H, M, B (all untested consonants).
- Avoids all excluded letters.

If T is at position 1 (✓), it solves the word. If T is at position 4 (─), future guesses will target position 4 directly.
</thinking>",Guess 4: thumb -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) H(✓) U(✓) M(✓) B(✓),SUCCESS
