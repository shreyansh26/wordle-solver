We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any feedback yet.
 The goal is to cover as many common letters as possible to gather information.
 One good starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"" because it contains common letters and covers vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).
 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"" are also good starters. Let me choose one that has a balanced set.

 After consideration, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word.

 However, note that the rules don't specify the dictionary. We assume it's the same as Wordle's.

 Let's use ""CRANE"".

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

I am at the beginning of the game with no prior feedback. To maximize information gain, I should choose a starting word that includes common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is an excellent first guess because:  
- It contains three commonly used consonants (C, R, N)  
- It includes two vowels (A, E)  
- It covers frequent letters that appear in many 5-letter words  
- The letters are all distinct, allowing me to efficiently eliminate multiple possibilities

We are given the feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.
 E(-) -> E is in the secret word but not in the correct position.

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter E, but not at the last position (since in ""crane"", E was the fifth letter).
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Since E is in the word but not in the last position, it must be in one of the positions 1 to 4.

 Now, for the second guess, we must:
 1. Choose a word that includes E (but not at the end) and avoids the letters C, R, A, N.
 2. We want to include other common letters to maximize information.

 Considering the English alphabet frequency, I should consider other common letters not yet tried: T, O, I, S, L, U, D, etc.

 A good approach is to pick a word that places E in one of the positions 1-4 and uses new common letters.

 Also, note that the secret word does not have any of C, R, A, N, so we must avoid these.

 Let me think of words that contain E and are 5 letters long, without C, R, A, N.

 Example words: 
   ""SPINE"" -> but this has E at the end, which we know is not the position? Actually, our feedback says E is in the word but not in the last position. So our new guess must have E not at position 5? But note: the feedback doesn't say that E isn't at position 5 in the secret word? Actually, the feedback says that in our first guess E was at position 5 and it was present but in the wrong position. Therefore, in the secret word, E is not at position 5. It can be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, in our new guess, we may place E elsewhere to test other positions.

 But note: we have no constraints on where E can be placed in our guess because we are allowed to test different positions. However, since we know E is in the word but not at pos 5, we may want to try it in other positions to get more positional information.

 However, we have limited information so we might try a word that has E in a different position (say, position 1 or 2) to see if it gets a ✓ or -.

 What are common words without C, R, A, N?
 Some ideas: 
   ""TIMES"" -> T, I, M, E, S -> but E is at position 4? This word has E at position 4? Actually ""TIMES"" is T(1), I(2), M(3), E(4), S(5). We avoid C, R, A, N.

 However, let me think about the feedback we might get: 
   If we put E at position 4, and if the secret word has E at say position 1, then we would get a '-' for E (since it's in the word but at wrong position). And then we know that position 4 isn't E? But we are testing E at position 4, and if we get a '-', that means E is in the word but not at position 4? But we already know E is not at position 5? Or perhaps place E at position 1 to see if it's correct.

 Alternatively, let me consider the word ""DEUCE"" -> contains C? We cannot have C. So discard.

 Let me think of words that have E and common letters:

 Good options:
   ""QUERY"" -> but contains R (forbidden) and Q and Y are less common? Also, we know R is out.
   ""OPENS"" -> O, P, E, N, S -> but contains N? We know N is out.

 We must avoid C, R, A, N.

 Another word: ""SPIEL"" -> S, P, I, E, L -> no forbidden letters. E at position 4? But we can use that.

 Or ""BELIE"" -> B, E, L, I, E -> but E at positions 2 and 5? Position 5 might be problematic because we know E isn't at position 5? Actually, we cannot have E at position 5? So having E at position 5 again in our guess would be a waste? Because we know from the feedback that E is not in position 5? Well, actually the feedback for the first word: E was marked as '-' meaning it's present but not at position 5? But it doesn't say anything about whether it can be at position 5 again? Actually, we know exactly: the secret word has E but not at position 5. So we can still include E at position 5 in a guess? However, that would not be efficient because we would expect that E is not at position 5? So we should try E at positions 1,2,3,4.

 Therefore, let's avoid having E at position 5.

 So, words with E at positions 1-4 without C,R,A,N.

 Options:
   ""SPIEL"" -> positions: S(1), P(2), I(3), E(4), L(5). E at position 4.
   ""QUEST"" -> Q, U, E, S, T -> E at position 3? But Q and U might be less common? And avoids C,R,A,N.
   ""TEETH"" -> T, E, E, T, H -> E at positions 2 and 3. But we have repeated letters? Not ideal because it might not maximize information per unique letter? Also, the word ""TEETH"" is valid? But we have repeated T? However, it's okay? Actually, in the context, the word must be valid.

 However, I want to cover as many new letters as possible. So avoiding repeated letters is better.

 After thinking, I choose ""SPIEL"":
   S, P, I, E, L -> all new letters? We haven't tried S, P, I, or L.

 Alternative: ""DOZEN"" -> contains N? Forbidden.

 Another: ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> avoids forbidden letters? No C,R,A,N? And E at position 4? This seems good. But we can also consider ""GUESS"" -> G, U, E, S, S -> has double S? Not ideal.

 Alternatively: ""BETTY"" -> B, E, T, T, Y -> repeated T, and Y might not be common.

 I think ""SPIEL"" is a good choice: 
   It covers S, P, I, L and reuses E (but we know E is in the word so we are testing position 4? But we haven't tested E at position 4 in the first guess? Actually, we placed E at position 5. And now we are placing E at position 4? This will tell us if E is at position 4 or not? Or if it's elsewhere? And we get information about S, P, I, L.

 So, I decide to guess ""SPIEL"".

 However, note: we have only 6 tries? We must be efficient. But also, since we are covering new letters, it's good.

 Another possibility: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E. But E at the end? Avoid.

 Or ""EYING"" -> E at position 1, but contains G and N? N is forbidden? No: E,Y,I,N,G -> N is in there? Forbidden? N is forbidden? No: in ""EYING"", it has N? Then cannot since we know N is not in the secret word.

 So, ""SPIEL"" seems safe: no C,R,A,N.

 Therefore, the second guess: ""SPIEL""

 The goal is to cover as many common letters as possible to gather information.
 One good starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"" because it contains common letters and covers vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).
 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"" are also good starters. Let me choose one that has a balanced set.

 After consideration, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word.

 However, note that the rules don't specify the dictionary. We assume it's the same as Wordle's.

 Let's use ""CRANE"".

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".I am at the beginning of the game with no prior feedback. To maximize information gain, I should choose a starting word that includes common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is an excellent first guess because:  
- It contains three commonly used consonants (C, R, N)  
- It includes two vowels (A, E)  
- It covers frequent letters that appear in many 5-letter words  
- The letters are all distinct, allowing me to efficiently eliminate multiple possibilities  
  
This guess will help me gather crucial feedback about the secret word's letters and their positions for subsequent guesses.

 A good approach is to pick a word that places E in one of the positions 1-4 and uses new common letters.

 Also, note that the secret word does not have any of C, R, A, N, so we must avoid these.

 Let me think of words that contain E and are 5 letters long, without C, R, A, N.

 Example words: 
   ""SPINE"" -> but this has E at the end, which we know is not the position? Actually, our feedback says E is in the word but not in the last position. So our new guess must have E not at position 5? But note: the feedback doesn't say that E isn't at position 5 in the secret word? Actually, the feedback says that in our first guess E was at position 5 and it was present but in the wrong position. Therefore, in the secret word, E is not at position 5. It can be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, in our new guess, we may place E elsewhere to test other positions.

 But note: we have no constraints on where E can be placed in our guess because we are allowed to test different positions. However, since we know E is in the word but not at pos 5, we may want to try it in other positions to get more positional information.

 However, we have limited information so we might try a word that has E in a different position (say, position 1 or 2) to see if it gets a ✓ or -.

 What are common words without C, R, A, N?
 Some ideas: 
   ""TIMES"" -> T, I, M, E, S -> but E is at position 4? This word has E at position 4? Actually ""TIMES"" is T(1), I(2), M(3), E(4), S(5). We avoid C, R, A, N.

 However, let me think about the feedback we might get: 
   If we put E at position 4, and if the secret word has E at say position 1, then we would get a '-' for E (since it's in the word but at wrong position). And then we know that position 4 isn't E? But we are testing E at position 4, and if we get a '-', that means E is in the word but not at position 4? But we already know E is not at position 5? Or perhaps place E at position 1 to see if it's correct.

 Alternatively, let me consider the word ""DEUCE"" -> contains C? We cannot have C. So discard.

 Let me think of words that have E and common letters:

 Good options:
   ""QUERY"" -> but contains R (forbidden) and Q and Y are less common? Also, we know R is out.
   ""OPENS"" -> O, P, E, N, S -> but contains N? We know N is out.

 We must avoid C, R, A, N.

 Another word: ""SPIEL"" -> S, P, I, E, L -> no forbidden letters. E at position 4? But we can use that.

 Or ""BELIE"" -> B, E, L, I, E -> but E at positions 2 and 5? Position 5 might be problematic because we know E isn't at position 5? Actually, we cannot have E at position 5? So having E at position 5 again in our guess would be a waste? Because we know from the feedback that E is not in position 5? Well, actually the feedback for the first word: E was marked as '-' meaning it's present but not at position 5? But it doesn't say anything about whether it can be at position 5 again? Actually, we know exactly: the secret word has E but not at position 5. So we can still include E at position 5 in a guess? However, that would not be efficient because we would expect that E is not at position 5? So we should try E at positions 1,2,3,4.

 Therefore, let's avoid having E at position 5.

 So, words with E at positions 1-4 without C,R,A,N.

 Options:
   ""SPIEL"" -> positions: S(1), P(2), I(3), E(4), L(5). E at position 4.
   ""QUEST"" -> Q, U, E, S, T -> E at position 3? But Q and U might be less common? And avoids C,R,A,N.
   ""TEETH"" -> T, E, E, T, H -> E at positions 2 and 3. But we have repeated letters? Not ideal because it might not maximize information per unique letter? Also, the word ""TEETH"" is valid? But we have repeated T? However, it's okay? Actually, in the context, the word must be valid.

 However, I want to cover as many new letters as possible. So avoiding repeated letters is better.

 After thinking, I choose ""SPIEL"":
   S, P, I, E, L -> all new letters? We haven't tried S, P, I, or L.

 Alternative: ""DOZEN"" -> contains N? Forbidden.

 Another: ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> avoids forbidden letters? No C,R,A,N? And E at position 4? This seems good. But we can also consider ""GUESS"" -> G, U, E, S, S -> has double S? Not ideal.

 Alternatively: ""BETTY"" -> B, E, T, T, Y -> repeated T, and Y might not be common.

 I think ""SPIEL"" is a good choice: 
   It covers S, P, I, L and reuses E (but we know E is in the word so we are testing position 4? But we haven't tested E at position 4 in the first guess? Actually, we placed E at position 5. And now we are placing E at position 4? This will tell us if E is at position 4 or not? Or if it's elsewhere? And we get information about S, P, I, L.

 So, I decide to guess ""SPIEL"".

 However, note: we have only 6 tries? We must be efficient. But also, since we are covering new letters, it's good.

 Another possibility: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E. But E at the end? Avoid.

 Or ""EYING"" -> E at position 1, but contains G and N? N is forbidden? No: E,Y,I,N,G -> N is in there? Forbidden? N is forbidden? No: in ""EYING"", it has N? Then cannot since we know N is not in the secret word.

 So, ""SPIEL"" seems safe: no C,R,A,N.

 Therefore, the second guess: ""SPIEL""

<guess>spiel</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, A, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked ❌).
- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ➖).

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** (since it's confirmed to be in the word), but **avoid positions 5** and the excluded letters (**C, R, A, N**).
- Focus on testing **new common letters** (e.g., **S, T, L, I, O, P**) to gather more information.
- Choose a word with E in a position not tested before (positions 1–4) to narrow down its location.

Selected **SPIEL** for the second guess because:
- Places E in **position 4** (previously untested position).
- Uses new common letters: **S, P, I, L**.
- No repeat letters, maximizing letter coverage.
- Avoids forbidden letters (**C, R, A, N**).

We are given feedback for two guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
   Meaning:
     - C, R, A, N are not in the word.
     - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. ""spiel"": S(✓), P(x), I(x), E(-), L(✓)
   Meaning:
     - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
     - P is not in the word.
     - I is not in the word.
     - E is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was placed at position 4 and got a '-').
     - L is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So, from the feedback, we know:

- The secret word has the letter S at position 1 and L at position 5.
- The secret word contains E, but not at position 4 or 5 (from the two guesses: position 5 in ""crane"" and position 4 in ""spiel"" are both wrong).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, I.

Also, note that we have two letters fixed: S at the start and L at the end.

So the word pattern is: S _ _ _ L

And we know E is in the word, but not in the first position (since S is there) and not in the last (L is there). Also, from the second guess, E is not in position 4? Actually, in ""spiel"", E was at position 4 and got a '-', meaning E is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, E must be in position 2 or 3.

So the word is: S [E?] [E?] [not E] L

But the third position could be E? Actually, E can be in position 2 or 3. And the fourth position is not E (because we got a '-' for E at position 4 in ""spiel"").

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: S [letter2] [letter3] [letter4] L

Where:
- letter2 and letter3: one of them must be E (since E is in the word and cannot be in position 1,4,5).
- The fourth letter is not E (as per the feedback from ""spiel"").

Also, we have eliminated: C, R, A, N, P, I.

We need to choose a word that fits the pattern and uses new letters to test for the middle positions.

We know the word must have an E in position 2 or 3.

Let's think of common letters that are still available: B, D, G, H, K, M, O, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible in positions 2, 3, and 4.

But note: we have two fixed letters (S and L) and one known letter (E) that must be in position 2 or 3.

We can try to guess a word that has E in position 2 and then two new letters in positions 3 and 4? Or E in position 3 and new letters in 2 and 4.

But we don't know which of the two positions (2 or 3) has the E. So we might want to test that.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has E in one of the positions and then other common letters to get more information.

Let me list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid the forbidden letters.

The word must be: S _ _ _ L, with E in either position 2 or 3, and the fourth letter is not E and not one of the forbidden (C,R,A,N,P,I).

Possible words:

If E is in position 2: S E _ _ L
  Then the word is S E X Y L, where X and Y are letters that are not forbidden and not E (and X cannot be E? Actually, E is already used? But we don't know if there is a second E? The feedback doesn't say anything about multiple E's? But in the first guess, we had only one E? Actually, we don't know. We only know that E is present at least once.

But in the second guess, we had only one E? And it was at position 4? So we don't know if there are more E's? However, we are not restricted.

But to be safe, we should consider that there might be only one E? Or multiple? We don't know.

But let's think of words:

S E _ _ L: 
  Examples: 
    ""SEWEL"" -> but W and E? But E is already at position 2? Then the last two are W and E? But we have L at the end? Actually, it's S E W E L? But that would be 5 letters? ""SEWEL"" is S-E-W-E-L? But then we have two E's? And the fourth letter is E? But we know from the second guess that position 4 is not E? So ""SEWEL"" would have E at position 4? That is forbidden? So we cannot have E at position 4.

So in S E _ _ L, the third and fourth letters must not be E? Because if E were at position 4, we already know it's not allowed? And position 3 could be E? But then we have two E's? But we don't know if that's allowed? The secret word might have two E's? But we haven't seen any evidence? However, we cannot rule out.

But we know for sure that position 4 is not E? So in S E _ _ L, the fourth letter must not be E. The third letter can be E? But then we have E at position 2 and 3? That is possible? But let's see the feedback: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was present? And in the second guess, we had E at position 4 and it was present? But if the word had E at position 2 and 3, then when we put E at position 4, it would still be present? But we got a '-' meaning it's present but not at position 4? So that's consistent? And if we put E at position 5 in the first guess, it would be present? So having two E's is possible? But we don't know.

However, we must avoid having E at position 4? So in our next guess, we should not put E at position 4? But we are going to put E at either 2 or 3? So that's fine.

But we don't know if E is at position 2 or 3? So we need to test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in position 2 and then two new letters? Or in position 3 and two new letters? And then we can see the feedback.

But we also have to consider that we have only 4 guesses left? We need to be efficient.

Let me think of common words that fit the pattern.

First, if E is in position 2: S E _ _ L
  Possible words: 
    ""SEWEL"" -> but has E at position 4? Not allowed? Because we know position 4 is not E? So invalid? Actually, ""SEWEL"" has E at position 2 and 4? But position 4 is E? We know that position 4 is not E? So we cannot use that? And also, it's invalid for the secret word? Because the secret word cannot have E at position 4? So the secret word cannot be ""SEWEL""? So we can skip.

  ""SEBUM"" -> but B, U, M? And not a common word? Probably not.

  ""SEDUL"" -> not a word? 

  ""SEGOL"" -> not common? 

  ""SEXTL"" -> not a word.

  ""SELLY"" -> but has L at position 3? But we already have L at position 5? And we don't know if L can be repeated? But in the second guess, we had L at position 5 and it was correct? So if we have L at position 3, that would be a different L? But the secret word might have two L's? We don't know? But in ""spiel"", we had L at position 5 and it was correct? And we didn't have any other L? So we don't know? But we can have repeated letters? Yes, it's possible.

  However, ""SELLY"" is S E L L Y? Then positions: 
      S(1)=S (correct), 
      E(2)=E? (if E is in the word, but we are testing E at position 2? and then L at position 3 and 4? and Y at position 5? But we have L at position 5? So position 5 is L? So if we have L at position 3 and 4, that's okay? But the word would be ""SELLY""? Is that a word? It might be? But let's check: ""Selly"" is not a standard word? I think ""silly"" is a word? But ""silly"" has I? But I is forbidden? So not.

  Actually, ""SELLY"" is not a common word? We should stick to common words.

  More common: ""SETTL"" -> not a word? ""SETUP"" -> but P is forbidden? And not ending with L? 

  This is hard? Maybe E is not in position 2? 

Now, if E is in position 3: S _ E _ L
  Then the word is S X E Y L, where X and Y are letters (not forbidden, and Y not E? because position 4 cannot be E?).

  Examples:
    ""SUEDE"" -> but ends with E? We need to end with L? Not.
    ""SHELL"" -> S H E L L? Then positions: 
        S(1)=S (correct)
        H(2)=? 
        E(3)=E (if E is at position 3, then it would be correct? but we don't know if E is at 3? we are testing)
        L(4)=L? but we have L at position 5? So if we have L at position 4 and 5? That would be repeated? 
        And the word is ""SHELL"", which is valid? But we have L at position 4? And we know that position 5 is L? So if the secret word is ""SHELL"", then position 5 is L? And position 4 is L? So when we guessed ""spiel"", we had L at position 5 and it was correct? But we didn't have L at position 4? So we don't know about position 4? 

  But in ""SHELL"", we have E at position 3? And we have S at 1 and L at 5? And the fourth letter is L? 

  But we also have H? 

  However, we are not sure? 

  Another common word: ""STEEL"" -> but has T and E? But E at position 3 and 4? But position 4 is E? We know position 4 cannot be E? So invalid? 

  ""STELL"" -> not a word? 

  ""SWELL"" -> S W E L L? Then positions: 1:S, 2:W, 3:E, 4:L, 5:L? But we have L at position 4 and 5? And we know position 5 is L? So if the secret word is ""SWELL"", then when we guessed ""spiel"", we had L at position 5 and it was correct? But we didn't have L at position 4? So that's okay? But the word ""SWELL"" has E at position 3? And position 4 is L? Which is not E? So that's allowed? 

  But is ""SWELL"" a valid word? Yes.

  However, we don't know if the secret word has two L's? 

  Another word: ""SMELL"" -> S M E L L? Similarly.

  But we have to avoid the forbidden letters? P is forbidden? But M is not? 

  Also, ""SHOAL"" -> but no E? We must have E? So not.

  ""STOLE"" -> but ends with E? We need L at the end? Not.

  ""STILL"" -> has I? Forbidden? I is not allowed? Because in guess2, I was marked x? So not.

  ""SPELL"" -> but P is forbidden? Not.

  So possible words: 
      SWELL, SMELL, SHELL, etc.

But we don't know which one? 

We need to make a guess that will help us distinguish? 

We have to consider that E might be in position 2? But we couldn't find many common words with E in position 2? 

Another word with E in position 2: ""SEAML"" -> not a word? ""SEPAL"" -> but P is forbidden? ""SEXED"" -> not ending with L? 

""SEIZE"" -> ends with E? Not.

""SELLE"" -> not a word? 

So maybe E is more likely in position 3? 

But we need to test.

We can try a word that has E in position 3 and then two new letters? For example, ""SMELL"" or ""SWELL""? But we have to avoid using forbidden letters? And we want to test new letters? 

But we have only 4 guesses left? We can try one of these? But if we guess ""SWELL"" and it's not the word, we get feedback? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't assume E in position 3? But we know E is in position 2 or 3? So we can try to put E in position 2 in our guess? But we don't know? 

We can choose a word that has E in position 2 and then two new letters? But we need to find one? 

Let me think: ""SEWEL"" is invalid? Because of position 4? 

""SEVEN"" -> not ending with L? 

""SEGUE"" -> not ending with L? 

""SELLE"" -> not a word? 

""SETTL"" -> not a word? 

""SEPTL"" -> not a word? 

So maybe there are no common words with E in position 2 and ending with L? 

Therefore, it's more likely that E is in position 3? 

So the secret word is probably S _ E _ L, with the second letter being a letter that is not forbidden and the fourth letter being a letter that is not forbidden and not E? 

And the fourth letter could be L? Then we have two L's? 

So let's list possible words: 
  SHELL: S H E L L
  SWELL: S W E L L
  SMELL: S M E L L
  SPELL: but P is forbidden? 
  STEEL: but E at position 4? Forbidden? 
  STILL: I is forbidden? 
  SKELP: not ending with L? 
  SKELF: not a word? 
  SHIEL: not a word? 
  ""SMELL"" and ""SWELL"" and ""SHELL"" are the main ones? 

But we also have ""DUELS"" -> not starting with S? 

We need to test one of these? But we can also test a word that has E in position 3 and a different fourth letter? 

For example, ""STELA"" -> but A is forbidden? And not ending with L? 

""STEDE"" -> not ending with L? 

""SUET"" -> not 5 letters? 

""SAYED"" -> not? 

So the common ones are the ones with double L at the end? 

But we don't know the second letter? 

We can try ""SMELL"" as a guess? 

But we have to consider that we might be wrong? 

Alternatively, we can try to get more information by using a word that has E in position 3 and then two new letters that are not L? But we need to end with L? So the fourth letter must be a letter that can come before L? 

For example, ""SPELT"" -> but P is forbidden? And not ending with L? 

""SKELM"" -> not ending with L? 

""SKELF"" -> not a word? 

""SKELP"" -> not ending with L? 

""SNELL"" -> but N is forbidden? 

So we are left with the ""S_ E L L"" pattern? 

Therefore, the secret word is likely one of: SHELL, SWELL, SMELL.

We can try one of them? 

But we have three possibilities? We can try ""SMELL"" and if it's not, then we have two left? 

But we have 4 guesses left? So we can do that? 

But we can also try a word that tests the second letter? 

For example, we can try a word that has E in position 3 and then uses a new letter in position 2 and a new letter in position 4? But we don't know if position 4 is L or not? 

But we know that in the secret word, position 4 is not E? But it could be L? Or it could be something else? 

But from the common words, it seems that position 4 is often L? 

But let's try to find a word that fits the pattern and has E in position 3 and a different fourth letter? 

For example, ""SUEDE"" -> not ending with L? 

""SAVES"" -> not? 

""SHEDS"" -> not? 

""SEEMS"" -> not? 

""SOEURS"" -> not 5 letters? 

It's hard? 

Another idea: ""SHELF"" -> S H E L F? Then positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:E, 4:L, 5:F? But we need position 5 to be L? But here it's F? So not? 

""SHOED"" -> not? 

So maybe the only possibilities are the ones with double L? 

Therefore, I think we should guess one of them? 

But which one? 

We can try ""SHELL"" because it's common? 

But we can also try a word that uses new letters to test? 

But we have to include E in position 3? And end with L? And avoid forbidden letters? 

We can try ""SMELL"" because M is a common letter? 

But let's see the feedback we would get? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have L in position 4? To test if position 4 is L? 

For example, we can try a word like ""SMEAR"" -> but A is forbidden? And not ending with L? 

""STEAM"" -> not? 

""SPEED"" -> not? 

It's difficult? 

Another word: ""STELL"" -> not a word? 

""SKELM"" -> not? 

I think we have to go with one of the three: SHELL, SWELL, SMELL.

We can try ""SMELL"" as a guess? 

But note: in ""SMELL"", we have M at position 2? And E at position 3? And L at position 4 and 5? 

But we know position 5 is L? So if we guess ""SMELL"", then:

- Position 1: S -> should be ✓ (we know it is)
- Position 2: M -> if the secret word is ""SMELL"", then ✓; if ""SHELL"", then x; if ""SWELL"", then x.
- Position 3: E -> should be ✓ in all cases? Because we think E is at position 3? 
- Position 4: L -> if the secret word has L at position 4? Then ✓? But if the secret word is ""SHELL"", then position 4 is L? Similarly for ""SWELL"" and ""SMELL""? So in all three, position 4 is L? Then we would get a ✓? 
- Position 5: L -> ✓ (we know)

But wait, if the secret word is ""SHELL"", then when we guess ""SMELL"", we would get:
  S(✓), M(x) because H is the second letter? Then E(✓) because E is at position 3? Then L(✓) at position 4? And L(✓) at position 5? 

Similarly, if it's ""SWELL"", then M would be x? 

And if it's ""SMELL"", then all ✓? 

So by guessing ""SMELL"", we can distinguish:

- If we get all ✓, then we win? 
- If we get S(✓), M(x), E(✓), L(✓), L(✓), then we know the second letter is not M? Then it could be H or W? 
- Then we can guess between ""SHELL"" and ""SWELL"" next? 

But we have 4 guesses left? So we can do that? 

But we also have to consider that there might be other words? For example, ""FREED"" -> not? 

Or ""STEED"" -> not? 

I think it's safe? 

But what about ""ODDLE"" -> not? 

Another possibility: ""SLEPT"" -> but P is forbidden? 

""SLYLY"" -> no E? 

So I think the main ones are the three? 

Therefore, I will guess ""SMELL"". 

But let's confirm the letters: 
  S, M, E, L, L? 
  We are avoiding C,R,A,N,P,I? Yes. 
  We are placing E at position 3? 
  And we are testing M? 

So it's a good guess? 

But we are repeating L? But we know L is at position 5? And we are putting L at position 4? We don't know if that's correct? 

But if we get a ✓ for L at position 4, then we know? 

So I think it's a good guess. 

Therefore, the third guess: ""SMELL""

But note: we are using two L's? But we know one L is at position 5? So if the secret word has only one L, then we would get a x for the L at position 4? But in our candidate words, they all have two L's? 

But what if there is a word with only one L? For example, ""SLEET"" -> but E at position 4? Forbidden? And not ending with L? 

""SEVEN"" -> not? 

I think it's safe? 

So let's go with ""SMELL"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(❌) R(❌) A(❌) N(❌) E(➖)  
  Interpretation:  
  - ❌ = C, R, A, N are **not** in the secret word.  
  - ➖ = E is in the secret word but **not in position 5**.  

- **Guess 2: SPIEL**  
  Feedback: S(✓) P(❌) I(❌) E(➖) L(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - ✓ = S is in the secret word and **correctly placed at position 1**.  
  - ❌ = P and I are **not** in the secret word.  
  - ➖ = E is in the secret word but **not in position 4**.  
  - ✓ = L is in the secret word and **correctly placed at position 5**.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed Positions**:  
   - Position 1 = **S** (confirmed ✓).  
   - Position 5 = **L** (confirmed ✓).  
   - The secret word pattern is: **S _ _ _ L**.  

2. **Confirmed Letter**:  
   - **E** is in the word but **cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5** (positions 1 and 5 are fixed, and position 4 was tested and rejected).  
   - Therefore, E must be in **position 2 or 3**.  

3. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - C, R, A, N, P, I are **not** in the word (all marked ❌).  

4. **Remaining Possibilities**:  
   - The secret word must be of the form **S X Y Z L**, where:  
     - One of X (position 2) or Y (position 3) must be **E**.  
     - Z (position 4) cannot be E (as per Guess 2 feedback).  
     - X, Y, Z must be letters not in the excluded list (e.g., B, D, G, H, K, M, O, T, U, W, Y).  
   - Common words fitting this pattern include **SHELL**, **SWELL**, and **SMELL** (all have E in position 3 and double L at the end).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test Position 3 for E**: Since E must be in position 2 or 3, placing E in position 3 (as in **SMELL**) tests the most likely scenario based on common words.  
- **Test New Letters**: Use **M** (position 2) and **L** (position 4) to gather new information:  
  - If M is correct (✓), it supports **SMELL**.  
  - If M is absent (❌), it rules out **SMELL** and points to **SHELL** or **SWELL** (where position 2 is H or W).  
- **Efficiency**: Guessing **SMELL** leverages the fixed S and L, tests E's position, and uses new letters (M) to narrow down possibilities quickly.  

### Guess:
<guess>smell</guess>",smell,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
   Meaning:
     - C, R, A, N are not in the word.
     - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. ""spiel"": S(✓), P(x), I(x), E(-), L(✓)
   Meaning:
     - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
     - P is not in the word.
     - I is not in the word.
     - E is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was placed at position 4 and got a '-').
     - L is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So, from the feedback, we know:

- The secret word has the letter S at position 1 and L at position 5.
- The secret word contains E, but not at position 4 or 5 (from the two guesses: position 5 in ""crane"" and position 4 in ""spiel"" are both wrong).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, I.

Also, note that we have two letters fixed: S at the start and L at the end.

So the word pattern is: S _ _ _ L

And we know E is in the word, but not in the first position (since S is there) and not in the last (L is there). Also, from the second guess, E is not in position 4? Actually, in ""spiel"", E was at position 4 and got a '-', meaning E is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, E must be in position 2 or 3.

So the word is: S [E?] [E?] [not E] L

But the third position could be E? Actually, E can be in position 2 or 3. And the fourth position is not E (because we got a '-' for E at position 4 in ""spiel"").

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: S [letter2] [letter3] [letter4] L

Where:
- letter2 and letter3: one of them must be E (since E is in the word and cannot be in position 1,4,5).
- The fourth letter is not E (as per the feedback from ""spiel"").

Also, we have eliminated: C, R, A, N, P, I.

We need to choose a word that fits the pattern and uses new letters to test for the middle positions.

We know the word must have an E in position 2 or 3.

Let's think of common letters that are still available: B, D, G, H, K, M, O, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible in positions 2, 3, and 4.

But note: we have two fixed letters (S and L) and one known letter (E) that must be in position 2 or 3.

We can try to guess a word that has E in position 2 and then two new letters in positions 3 and 4? Or E in position 3 and new letters in 2 and 4.

But we don't know which of the two positions (2 or 3) has the E. So we might want to test that.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has E in one of the positions and then other common letters to get more information.

Let me list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid the forbidden letters.

The word must be: S _ _ _ L, with E in either position 2 or 3, and the fourth letter is not E and not one of the forbidden (C,R,A,N,P,I).

Possible words:

If E is in position 2: S E _ _ L
  Then the word is S E X Y L, where X and Y are letters that are not forbidden and not E (and X cannot be E? Actually, E is already used? But we don't know if there is a second E? The feedback doesn't say anything about multiple E's? But in the first guess, we had only one E? Actually, we don't know. We only know that E is present at least once.

But in the second guess, we had only one E? And it was at position 4? So we don't know if there are more E's? However, we are not restricted.

But to be safe, we should consider that there might be only one E? Or multiple? We don't know.

But let's think of words:

S E _ _ L: 
  Examples: 
    ""SEWEL"" -> but W and E? But E is already at position 2? Then the last two are W and E? But we have L at the end? Actually, it's S E W E L? But that would be 5 letters? ""SEWEL"" is S-E-W-E-L? But then we have two E's? And the fourth letter is E? But we know from the second guess that position 4 is not E? So ""SEWEL"" would have E at position 4? That is forbidden? So we cannot have E at position 4.

So in S E _ _ L, the third and fourth letters must not be E? Because if E were at position 4, we already know it's not allowed? And position 3 could be E? But then we have two E's? But we don't know if that's allowed? The secret word might have two E's? But we haven't seen any evidence? However, we cannot rule out.

But we know for sure that position 4 is not E? So in S E _ _ L, the fourth letter must not be E. The third letter can be E? But then we have E at position 2 and 3? That is possible? But let's see the feedback: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was present? And in the second guess, we had E at position 4 and it was present? But if the word had E at position 2 and 3, then when we put E at position 4, it would still be present? But we got a '-' meaning it's present but not at position 4? So that's consistent? And if we put E at position 5 in the first guess, it would be present? So having two E's is possible? But we don't know.

However, we must avoid having E at position 4? So in our next guess, we should not put E at position 4? But we are going to put E at either 2 or 3? So that's fine.

But we don't know if E is at position 2 or 3? So we need to test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in position 2 and then two new letters? Or in position 3 and two new letters? And then we can see the feedback.

But we also have to consider that we have only 4 guesses left? We need to be efficient.

Let me think of common words that fit the pattern.

First, if E is in position 2: S E _ _ L
  Possible words: 
    ""SEWEL"" -> but has E at position 4? Not allowed? Because we know position 4 is not E? So invalid? Actually, ""SEWEL"" has E at position 2 and 4? But position 4 is E? We know that position 4 is not E? So we cannot use that? And also, it's invalid for the secret word? Because the secret word cannot have E at position 4? So the secret word cannot be ""SEWEL""? So we can skip.

  ""SEBUM"" -> but B, U, M? And not a common word? Probably not.

  ""SEDUL"" -> not a word? 

  ""SEGOL"" -> not common? 

  ""SEXTL"" -> not a word.

  ""SELLY"" -> but has L at position 3? But we already have L at position 5? And we don't know if L can be repeated? But in the second guess, we had L at position 5 and it was correct? So if we have L at position 3, that would be a different L? But the secret word might have two L's? We don't know? But in ""spiel"", we had L at position 5 and it was correct? And we didn't have any other L? So we don't know? But we can have repeated letters? Yes, it's possible.

  However, ""SELLY"" is S E L L Y? Then positions: 
      S(1)=S (correct), 
      E(2)=E? (if E is in the word, but we are testing E at position 2? and then L at position 3 and 4? and Y at position 5? But we have L at position 5? So position 5 is L? So if we have L at position 3 and 4, that's okay? But the word would be ""SELLY""? Is that a word? It might be? But let's check: ""Selly"" is not a standard word? I think ""silly"" is a word? But ""silly"" has I? But I is forbidden? So not.

  Actually, ""SELLY"" is not a common word? We should stick to common words.

  More common: ""SETTL"" -> not a word? ""SETUP"" -> but P is forbidden? And not ending with L? 

  This is hard? Maybe E is not in position 2? 

Now, if E is in position 3: S _ E _ L
  Then the word is S X E Y L, where X and Y are letters (not forbidden, and Y not E? because position 4 cannot be E?).

  Examples:
    ""SUEDE"" -> but ends with E? We need to end with L? Not.
    ""SHELL"" -> S H E L L? Then positions: 
        S(1)=S (correct)
        H(2)=? 
        E(3)=E (if E is at position 3, then it would be correct? but we don't know if E is at 3? we are testing)
        L(4)=L? but we have L at position 5? So if we have L at position 4 and 5? That would be repeated? 
        And the word is ""SHELL"", which is valid? But we have L at position 4? And we know that position 5 is L? So if the secret word is ""SHELL"", then position 5 is L? And position 4 is L? So when we guessed ""spiel"", we had L at position 5 and it was correct? But we didn't have L at position 4? So we don't know about position 4? 

  But in ""SHELL"", we have E at position 3? And we have S at 1 and L at 5? And the fourth letter is L? 

  But we also have H? 

  However, we are not sure? 

  Another common word: ""STEEL"" -> but has T and E? But E at position 3 and 4? But position 4 is E? We know position 4 cannot be E? So invalid? 

  ""STELL"" -> not a word? 

  ""SWELL"" -> S W E L L? Then positions: 1:S, 2:W, 3:E, 4:L, 5:L? But we have L at position 4 and 5? And we know position 5 is L? So if the secret word is ""SWELL"", then when we guessed ""spiel"", we had L at position 5 and it was correct? But we didn't have L at position 4? So that's okay? But the word ""SWELL"" has E at position 3? And position 4 is L? Which is not E? So that's allowed? 

  But is ""SWELL"" a valid word? Yes.

  However, we don't know if the secret word has two L's? 

  Another word: ""SMELL"" -> S M E L L? Similarly.

  But we have to avoid the forbidden letters? P is forbidden? But M is not? 

  Also, ""SHOAL"" -> but no E? We must have E? So not.

  ""STOLE"" -> but ends with E? We need L at the end? Not.

  ""STILL"" -> has I? Forbidden? I is not allowed? Because in guess2, I was marked x? So not.

  ""SPELL"" -> but P is forbidden? Not.

  So possible words: 
      SWELL, SMELL, SHELL, etc.

But we don't know which one? 

We need to make a guess that will help us distinguish? 

We have to consider that E might be in position 2? But we couldn't find many common words with E in position 2? 

Another word with E in position 2: ""SEAML"" -> not a word? ""SEPAL"" -> but P is forbidden? ""SEXED"" -> not ending with L? 

""SEIZE"" -> ends with E? Not.

""SELLE"" -> not a word? 

So maybe E is more likely in position 3? 

But we need to test.

We can try a word that has E in position 3 and then two new letters? For example, ""SMELL"" or ""SWELL""? But we have to avoid using forbidden letters? And we want to test new letters? 

But we have only 4 guesses left? We can try one of these? But if we guess ""SWELL"" and it's not the word, we get feedback? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't assume E in position 3? But we know E is in position 2 or 3? So we can try to put E in position 2 in our guess? But we don't know? 

We can choose a word that has E in position 2 and then two new letters? But we need to find one? 

Let me think: ""SEWEL"" is invalid? Because of position 4? 

""SEVEN"" -> not ending with L? 

""SEGUE"" -> not ending with L? 

""SELLE"" -> not a word? 

""SETTL"" -> not a word? 

""SEPTL"" -> not a word? 

So maybe there are no common words with E in position 2 and ending with L? 

Therefore, it's more likely that E is in position 3? 

So the secret word is probably S _ E _ L, with the second letter being a letter that is not forbidden and the fourth letter being a letter that is not forbidden and not E? 

And the fourth letter could be L? Then we have two L's? 

So let's list possible words: 
  SHELL: S H E L L
  SWELL: S W E L L
  SMELL: S M E L L
  SPELL: but P is forbidden? 
  STEEL: but E at position 4? Forbidden? 
  STILL: I is forbidden? 
  SKELP: not ending with L? 
  SKELF: not a word? 
  SHIEL: not a word? 
  ""SMELL"" and ""SWELL"" and ""SHELL"" are the main ones? 

But we also have ""DUELS"" -> not starting with S? 

We need to test one of these? But we can also test a word that has E in position 3 and a different fourth letter? 

For example, ""STELA"" -> but A is forbidden? And not ending with L? 

""STEDE"" -> not ending with L? 

""SUET"" -> not 5 letters? 

""SAYED"" -> not? 

So the common ones are the ones with double L at the end? 

But we don't know the second letter? 

We can try ""SMELL"" as a guess? 

But we have to consider that we might be wrong? 

Alternatively, we can try to get more information by using a word that has E in position 3 and then two new letters that are not L? But we need to end with L? So the fourth letter must be a letter that can come before L? 

For example, ""SPELT"" -> but P is forbidden? And not ending with L? 

""SKELM"" -> not ending with L? 

""SKELF"" -> not a word? 

""SKELP"" -> not ending with L? 

""SNELL"" -> but N is forbidden? 

So we are left with the ""S_ E L L"" pattern? 

Therefore, the secret word is likely one of: SHELL, SWELL, SMELL.

We can try one of them? 

But we have three possibilities? We can try ""SMELL"" and if it's not, then we have two left? 

But we have 4 guesses left? So we can do that? 

But we can also try a word that tests the second letter? 

For example, we can try a word that has E in position 3 and then uses a new letter in position 2 and a new letter in position 4? But we don't know if position 4 is L or not? 

But we know that in the secret word, position 4 is not E? But it could be L? Or it could be something else? 

But from the common words, it seems that position 4 is often L? 

But let's try to find a word that fits the pattern and has E in position 3 and a different fourth letter? 

For example, ""SUEDE"" -> not ending with L? 

""SAVES"" -> not? 

""SHEDS"" -> not? 

""SEEMS"" -> not? 

""SOEURS"" -> not 5 letters? 

It's hard? 

Another idea: ""SHELF"" -> S H E L F? Then positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:E, 4:L, 5:F? But we need position 5 to be L? But here it's F? So not? 

""SHOED"" -> not? 

So maybe the only possibilities are the ones with double L? 

Therefore, I think we should guess one of them? 

But which one? 

We can try ""SHELL"" because it's common? 

But we can also try a word that uses new letters to test? 

But we have to include E in position 3? And end with L? And avoid forbidden letters? 

We can try ""SMELL"" because M is a common letter? 

But let's see the feedback we would get? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have L in position 4? To test if position 4 is L? 

For example, we can try a word like ""SMEAR"" -> but A is forbidden? And not ending with L? 

""STEAM"" -> not? 

""SPEED"" -> not? 

It's difficult? 

Another word: ""STELL"" -> not a word? 

""SKELM"" -> not? 

I think we have to go with one of the three: SHELL, SWELL, SMELL.

We can try ""SMELL"" as a guess? 

But note: in ""SMELL"", we have M at position 2? And E at position 3? And L at position 4 and 5? 

But we know position 5 is L? So if we guess ""SMELL"", then:

- Position 1: S -> should be ✓ (we know it is)
- Position 2: M -> if the secret word is ""SMELL"", then ✓; if ""SHELL"", then x; if ""SWELL"", then x.
- Position 3: E -> should be ✓ in all cases? Because we think E is at position 3? 
- Position 4: L -> if the secret word has L at position 4? Then ✓? But if the secret word is ""SHELL"", then position 4 is L? Similarly for ""SWELL"" and ""SMELL""? So in all three, position 4 is L? Then we would get a ✓? 
- Position 5: L -> ✓ (we know)

But wait, if the secret word is ""SHELL"", then when we guess ""SMELL"", we would get:
  S(✓), M(x) because H is the second letter? Then E(✓) because E is at position 3? Then L(✓) at position 4? And L(✓) at position 5? 

Similarly, if it's ""SWELL"", then M would be x? 

And if it's ""SMELL"", then all ✓? 

So by guessing ""SMELL"", we can distinguish:

- If we get all ✓, then we win? 
- If we get S(✓), M(x), E(✓), L(✓), L(✓), then we know the second letter is not M? Then it could be H or W? 
- Then we can guess between ""SHELL"" and ""SWELL"" next? 

But we have 4 guesses left? So we can do that? 

But we also have to consider that there might be other words? For example, ""FREED"" -> not? 

Or ""STEED"" -> not? 

I think it's safe? 

But what about ""ODDLE"" -> not? 

Another possibility: ""SLEPT"" -> but P is forbidden? 

""SLYLY"" -> no E? 

So I think the main ones are the three? 

Therefore, I will guess ""SMELL"". 

But let's confirm the letters: 
  S, M, E, L, L? 
  We are avoiding C,R,A,N,P,I? Yes. 
  We are placing E at position 3? 
  And we are testing M? 

So it's a good guess? 

But we are repeating L? But we know L is at position 5? And we are putting L at position 4? We don't know if that's correct? 

But if we get a ✓ for L at position 4, then we know? 

So I think it's a good guess. 

Therefore, the third guess: ""SMELL""

But note: we are using two L's? But we know one L is at position 5? So if the secret word has only one L, then we would get a x for the L at position 4? But in our candidate words, they all have two L's? 

But what if there is a word with only one L? For example, ""SLEET"" -> but E at position 4? Forbidden? And not ending with L? 

""SEVEN"" -> not? 

I think it's safe? 

So let's go with ""SMELL"". 

<guess>smell</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(❌) R(❌) A(❌) N(❌) E(➖)  
  Interpretation:  
  - ❌ = C, R, A, N are **not** in the secret word.  
  - ➖ = E is in the secret word but **not in position 5**.  

- **Guess 2: SPIEL**  
  Feedback: S(✓) P(❌) I(❌) E(➖) L(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - ✓ = S is in the secret word and **correctly placed at position 1**.  
  - ❌ = P and I are **not** in the secret word.  
  - ➖ = E is in the secret word but **not in position 4**.  
  - ✓ = L is in the secret word and **correctly placed at position 5**.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed Positions**:  
   - Position 1 = **S** (confirmed ✓).  
   - Position 5 = **L** (confirmed ✓).  
   - The secret word pattern is: **S _ _ _ L**.  

2. **Confirmed Letter**:  
   - **E** is in the word but **cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5** (positions 1 and 5 are fixed, and position 4 was tested and rejected).  
   - Therefore, E must be in **position 2 or 3**.  

3. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - C, R, A, N, P, I are **not** in the word (all marked ❌).  

4. **Remaining Possibilities**:  
   - The secret word must be of the form **S X Y Z L**, where:  
     - One of X (position 2) or Y (position 3) must be **E**.  
     - Z (position 4) cannot be E (as per Guess 2 feedback).  
     - X, Y, Z must be letters not in the excluded list (e.g., B, D, G, H, K, M, O, T, U, W, Y).  
   - Common words fitting this pattern include **SHELL**, **SWELL**, and **SMELL** (all have E in position 3 and double L at the end).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test Position 3 for E**: Since E must be in position 2 or 3, placing E in position 3 (as in **SMELL**) tests the most likely scenario based on common words.  
- **Test New Letters**: Use **M** (position 2) and **L** (position 4) to gather new information:  
  - If M is correct (✓), it supports **SMELL**.  
  - If M is absent (❌), it rules out **SMELL** and points to **SHELL** or **SWELL** (where position 2 is H or W).  
- **Efficiency**: Guessing **SMELL** leverages the fixed S and L, tests E's position, and uses new letters (M) to narrow down possibilities quickly.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any feedback yet.
 The goal is to cover as many common letters as possible to gather information.
 One good starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"" because it contains common letters and covers vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).
 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"" are also good starters. Let me choose one that has a balanced set.

 After consideration, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word.

 However, note that the rules don't specify the dictionary. We assume it's the same as Wordle's.

 Let's use ""CRANE"".

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".I am at the beginning of the game with no prior feedback. To maximize information gain, I should choose a starting word that includes common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is an excellent first guess because:  
- It contains three commonly used consonants (C, R, N)  
- It includes two vowels (A, E)  
- It covers frequent letters that appear in many 5-letter words  
- The letters are all distinct, allowing me to efficiently eliminate multiple possibilities  
  
This guess will help me gather crucial feedback about the secret word's letters and their positions for subsequent guesses.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.
 E(-) -> E is in the secret word but not in the correct position.

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter E, but not at the last position (since in ""crane"", E was the fifth letter).
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Since E is in the word but not in the last position, it must be in one of the positions 1 to 4.

 Now, for the second guess, we must:
 1. Choose a word that includes E (but not at the end) and avoids the letters C, R, A, N.
 2. We want to include other common letters to maximize information.

 Considering the English alphabet frequency, I should consider other common letters not yet tried: T, O, I, S, L, U, D, etc.

 A good approach is to pick a word that places E in one of the positions 1-4 and uses new common letters.

 Also, note that the secret word does not have any of C, R, A, N, so we must avoid these.

 Let me think of words that contain E and are 5 letters long, without C, R, A, N.

 Example words: 
   ""SPINE"" -> but this has E at the end, which we know is not the position? Actually, our feedback says E is in the word but not in the last position. So our new guess must have E not at position 5? But note: the feedback doesn't say that E isn't at position 5 in the secret word? Actually, the feedback says that in our first guess E was at position 5 and it was present but in the wrong position. Therefore, in the secret word, E is not at position 5. It can be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, in our new guess, we may place E elsewhere to test other positions.

 But note: we have no constraints on where E can be placed in our guess because we are allowed to test different positions. However, since we know E is in the word but not at pos 5, we may want to try it in other positions to get more positional information.

 However, we have limited information so we might try a word that has E in a different position (say, position 1 or 2) to see if it gets a ✓ or -.

 What are common words without C, R, A, N?
 Some ideas: 
   ""TIMES"" -> T, I, M, E, S -> but E is at position 4? This word has E at position 4? Actually ""TIMES"" is T(1), I(2), M(3), E(4), S(5). We avoid C, R, A, N.

 However, let me think about the feedback we might get: 
   If we put E at position 4, and if the secret word has E at say position 1, then we would get a '-' for E (since it's in the word but at wrong position). And then we know that position 4 isn't E? But we are testing E at position 4, and if we get a '-', that means E is in the word but not at position 4? But we already know E is not at position 5? Or perhaps place E at position 1 to see if it's correct.

 Alternatively, let me consider the word ""DEUCE"" -> contains C? We cannot have C. So discard.

 Let me think of words that have E and common letters:

 Good options:
   ""QUERY"" -> but contains R (forbidden) and Q and Y are less common? Also, we know R is out.
   ""OPENS"" -> O, P, E, N, S -> but contains N? We know N is out.

 We must avoid C, R, A, N.

 Another word: ""SPIEL"" -> S, P, I, E, L -> no forbidden letters. E at position 4? But we can use that.

 Or ""BELIE"" -> B, E, L, I, E -> but E at positions 2 and 5? Position 5 might be problematic because we know E isn't at position 5? Actually, we cannot have E at position 5? So having E at position 5 again in our guess would be a waste? Because we know from the feedback that E is not in position 5? Well, actually the feedback for the first word: E was marked as '-' meaning it's present but not at position 5? But it doesn't say anything about whether it can be at position 5 again? Actually, we know exactly: the secret word has E but not at position 5. So we can still include E at position 5 in a guess? However, that would not be efficient because we would expect that E is not at position 5? So we should try E at positions 1,2,3,4.

 Therefore, let's avoid having E at position 5.

 So, words with E at positions 1-4 without C,R,A,N.

 Options:
   ""SPIEL"" -> positions: S(1), P(2), I(3), E(4), L(5). E at position 4.
   ""QUEST"" -> Q, U, E, S, T -> E at position 3? But Q and U might be less common? And avoids C,R,A,N.
   ""TEETH"" -> T, E, E, T, H -> E at positions 2 and 3. But we have repeated letters? Not ideal because it might not maximize information per unique letter? Also, the word ""TEETH"" is valid? But we have repeated T? However, it's okay? Actually, in the context, the word must be valid.

 However, I want to cover as many new letters as possible. So avoiding repeated letters is better.

 After thinking, I choose ""SPIEL"":
   S, P, I, E, L -> all new letters? We haven't tried S, P, I, or L.

 Alternative: ""DOZEN"" -> contains N? Forbidden.

 Another: ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> avoids forbidden letters? No C,R,A,N? And E at position 4? This seems good. But we can also consider ""GUESS"" -> G, U, E, S, S -> has double S? Not ideal.

 Alternatively: ""BETTY"" -> B, E, T, T, Y -> repeated T, and Y might not be common.

 I think ""SPIEL"" is a good choice: 
   It covers S, P, I, L and reuses E (but we know E is in the word so we are testing position 4? But we haven't tested E at position 4 in the first guess? Actually, we placed E at position 5. And now we are placing E at position 4? This will tell us if E is at position 4 or not? Or if it's elsewhere? And we get information about S, P, I, L.

 So, I decide to guess ""SPIEL"".

 However, note: we have only 6 tries? We must be efficient. But also, since we are covering new letters, it's good.

 Another possibility: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E. But E at the end? Avoid.

 Or ""EYING"" -> E at position 1, but contains G and N? N is forbidden? No: E,Y,I,N,G -> N is in there? Forbidden? N is forbidden? No: in ""EYING"", it has N? Then cannot since we know N is not in the secret word.

 So, ""SPIEL"" seems safe: no C,R,A,N.

 Therefore, the second guess: ""SPIEL""

<guess>spiel</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, A, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked ❌).
- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ➖).

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** (since it's confirmed to be in the word), but **avoid positions 5** and the excluded letters (**C, R, A, N**).
- Focus on testing **new common letters** (e.g., **S, T, L, I, O, P**) to gather more information.
- Choose a word with E in a position not tested before (positions 1–4) to narrow down its location.

Selected **SPIEL** for the second guess because:
- Places E in **position 4** (previously untested position).
- Uses new common letters: **S, P, I, L**.
- No repeat letters, maximizing letter coverage.
- Avoids forbidden letters (**C, R, A, N**).

<guess>spiel</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: spiel -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) I(x) E(-) L(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
   Meaning:
     - C, R, A, N are not in the word.
     - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. ""spiel"": S(✓), P(x), I(x), E(-), L(✓)
   Meaning:
     - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
     - P is not in the word.
     - I is not in the word.
     - E is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was placed at position 4 and got a '-').
     - L is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So, from the feedback, we know:

- The secret word has the letter S at position 1 and L at position 5.
- The secret word contains E, but not at position 4 or 5 (from the two guesses: position 5 in ""crane"" and position 4 in ""spiel"" are both wrong).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, I.

Also, note that we have two letters fixed: S at the start and L at the end.

So the word pattern is: S _ _ _ L

And we know E is in the word, but not in the first position (since S is there) and not in the last (L is there). Also, from the second guess, E is not in position 4? Actually, in ""spiel"", E was at position 4 and got a '-', meaning E is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, E must be in position 2 or 3.

So the word is: S [E?] [E?] [not E] L

But the third position could be E? Actually, E can be in position 2 or 3. And the fourth position is not E (because we got a '-' for E at position 4 in ""spiel"").

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: S [letter2] [letter3] [letter4] L

Where:
- letter2 and letter3: one of them must be E (since E is in the word and cannot be in position 1,4,5).
- The fourth letter is not E (as per the feedback from ""spiel"").

Also, we have eliminated: C, R, A, N, P, I.

We need to choose a word that fits the pattern and uses new letters to test for the middle positions.

We know the word must have an E in position 2 or 3.

Let's think of common letters that are still available: B, D, G, H, K, M, O, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible in positions 2, 3, and 4.

But note: we have two fixed letters (S and L) and one known letter (E) that must be in position 2 or 3.

We can try to guess a word that has E in position 2 and then two new letters in positions 3 and 4? Or E in position 3 and new letters in 2 and 4.

But we don't know which of the two positions (2 or 3) has the E. So we might want to test that.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has E in one of the positions and then other common letters to get more information.

Let me list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid the forbidden letters.

The word must be: S _ _ _ L, with E in either position 2 or 3, and the fourth letter is not E and not one of the forbidden (C,R,A,N,P,I).

Possible words:

If E is in position 2: S E _ _ L
  Then the word is S E X Y L, where X and Y are letters that are not forbidden and not E (and X cannot be E? Actually, E is already used? But we don't know if there is a second E? The feedback doesn't say anything about multiple E's? But in the first guess, we had only one E? Actually, we don't know. We only know that E is present at least once.

But in the second guess, we had only one E? And it was at position 4? So we don't know if there are more E's? However, we are not restricted.

But to be safe, we should consider that there might be only one E? Or multiple? We don't know.

But let's think of words:

S E _ _ L: 
  Examples: 
    ""SEWEL"" -> but W and E? But E is already at position 2? Then the last two are W and E? But we have L at the end? Actually, it's S E W E L? But that would be 5 letters? ""SEWEL"" is S-E-W-E-L? But then we have two E's? And the fourth letter is E? But we know from the second guess that position 4 is not E? So ""SEWEL"" would have E at position 4? That is forbidden? So we cannot have E at position 4.

So in S E _ _ L, the third and fourth letters must not be E? Because if E were at position 4, we already know it's not allowed? And position 3 could be E? But then we have two E's? But we don't know if that's allowed? The secret word might have two E's? But we haven't seen any evidence? However, we cannot rule out.

But we know for sure that position 4 is not E? So in S E _ _ L, the fourth letter must not be E. The third letter can be E? But then we have E at position 2 and 3? That is possible? But let's see the feedback: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was present? And in the second guess, we had E at position 4 and it was present? But if the word had E at position 2 and 3, then when we put E at position 4, it would still be present? But we got a '-' meaning it's present but not at position 4? So that's consistent? And if we put E at position 5 in the first guess, it would be present? So having two E's is possible? But we don't know.

However, we must avoid having E at position 4? So in our next guess, we should not put E at position 4? But we are going to put E at either 2 or 3? So that's fine.

But we don't know if E is at position 2 or 3? So we need to test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in position 2 and then two new letters? Or in position 3 and two new letters? And then we can see the feedback.

But we also have to consider that we have only 4 guesses left? We need to be efficient.

Let me think of common words that fit the pattern.

First, if E is in position 2: S E _ _ L
  Possible words: 
    ""SEWEL"" -> but has E at position 4? Not allowed? Because we know position 4 is not E? So invalid? Actually, ""SEWEL"" has E at position 2 and 4? But position 4 is E? We know that position 4 is not E? So we cannot use that? And also, it's invalid for the secret word? Because the secret word cannot have E at position 4? So the secret word cannot be ""SEWEL""? So we can skip.

  ""SEBUM"" -> but B, U, M? And not a common word? Probably not.

  ""SEDUL"" -> not a word? 

  ""SEGOL"" -> not common? 

  ""SEXTL"" -> not a word.

  ""SELLY"" -> but has L at position 3? But we already have L at position 5? And we don't know if L can be repeated? But in the second guess, we had L at position 5 and it was correct? So if we have L at position 3, that would be a different L? But the secret word might have two L's? We don't know? But in ""spiel"", we had L at position 5 and it was correct? And we didn't have any other L? So we don't know? But we can have repeated letters? Yes, it's possible.

  However, ""SELLY"" is S E L L Y? Then positions: 
      S(1)=S (correct), 
      E(2)=E? (if E is in the word, but we are testing E at position 2? and then L at position 3 and 4? and Y at position 5? But we have L at position 5? So position 5 is L? So if we have L at position 3 and 4, that's okay? But the word would be ""SELLY""? Is that a word? It might be? But let's check: ""Selly"" is not a standard word? I think ""silly"" is a word? But ""silly"" has I? But I is forbidden? So not.

  Actually, ""SELLY"" is not a common word? We should stick to common words.

  More common: ""SETTL"" -> not a word? ""SETUP"" -> but P is forbidden? And not ending with L? 

  This is hard? Maybe E is not in position 2? 

Now, if E is in position 3: S _ E _ L
  Then the word is S X E Y L, where X and Y are letters (not forbidden, and Y not E? because position 4 cannot be E?).

  Examples:
    ""SUEDE"" -> but ends with E? We need to end with L? Not.
    ""SHELL"" -> S H E L L? Then positions: 
        S(1)=S (correct)
        H(2)=? 
        E(3)=E (if E is at position 3, then it would be correct? but we don't know if E is at 3? we are testing)
        L(4)=L? but we have L at position 5? So if we have L at position 4 and 5? That would be repeated? 
        And the word is ""SHELL"", which is valid? But we have L at position 4? And we know that position 5 is L? So if the secret word is ""SHELL"", then position 5 is L? And position 4 is L? So when we guessed ""spiel"", we had L at position 5 and it was correct? But we didn't have L at position 4? So we don't know about position 4? 

  But in ""SHELL"", we have E at position 3? And we have S at 1 and L at 5? And the fourth letter is L? 

  But we also have H? 

  However, we are not sure? 

  Another common word: ""STEEL"" -> but has T and E? But E at position 3 and 4? But position 4 is E? We know position 4 cannot be E? So invalid? 

  ""STELL"" -> not a word? 

  ""SWELL"" -> S W E L L? Then positions: 1:S, 2:W, 3:E, 4:L, 5:L? But we have L at position 4 and 5? And we know position 5 is L? So if the secret word is ""SWELL"", then when we guessed ""spiel"", we had L at position 5 and it was correct? But we didn't have L at position 4? So that's okay? But the word ""SWELL"" has E at position 3? And position 4 is L? Which is not E? So that's allowed? 

  But is ""SWELL"" a valid word? Yes.

  However, we don't know if the secret word has two L's? 

  Another word: ""SMELL"" -> S M E L L? Similarly.

  But we have to avoid the forbidden letters? P is forbidden? But M is not? 

  Also, ""SHOAL"" -> but no E? We must have E? So not.

  ""STOLE"" -> but ends with E? We need L at the end? Not.

  ""STILL"" -> has I? Forbidden? I is not allowed? Because in guess2, I was marked x? So not.

  ""SPELL"" -> but P is forbidden? Not.

  So possible words: 
      SWELL, SMELL, SHELL, etc.

But we don't know which one? 

We need to make a guess that will help us distinguish? 

We have to consider that E might be in position 2? But we couldn't find many common words with E in position 2? 

Another word with E in position 2: ""SEAML"" -> not a word? ""SEPAL"" -> but P is forbidden? ""SEXED"" -> not ending with L? 

""SEIZE"" -> ends with E? Not.

""SELLE"" -> not a word? 

So maybe E is more likely in position 3? 

But we need to test.

We can try a word that has E in position 3 and then two new letters? For example, ""SMELL"" or ""SWELL""? But we have to avoid using forbidden letters? And we want to test new letters? 

But we have only 4 guesses left? We can try one of these? But if we guess ""SWELL"" and it's not the word, we get feedback? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't assume E in position 3? But we know E is in position 2 or 3? So we can try to put E in position 2 in our guess? But we don't know? 

We can choose a word that has E in position 2 and then two new letters? But we need to find one? 

Let me think: ""SEWEL"" is invalid? Because of position 4? 

""SEVEN"" -> not ending with L? 

""SEGUE"" -> not ending with L? 

""SELLE"" -> not a word? 

""SETTL"" -> not a word? 

""SEPTL"" -> not a word? 

So maybe there are no common words with E in position 2 and ending with L? 

Therefore, it's more likely that E is in position 3? 

So the secret word is probably S _ E _ L, with the second letter being a letter that is not forbidden and the fourth letter being a letter that is not forbidden and not E? 

And the fourth letter could be L? Then we have two L's? 

So let's list possible words: 
  SHELL: S H E L L
  SWELL: S W E L L
  SMELL: S M E L L
  SPELL: but P is forbidden? 
  STEEL: but E at position 4? Forbidden? 
  STILL: I is forbidden? 
  SKELP: not ending with L? 
  SKELF: not a word? 
  SHIEL: not a word? 
  ""SMELL"" and ""SWELL"" and ""SHELL"" are the main ones? 

But we also have ""DUELS"" -> not starting with S? 

We need to test one of these? But we can also test a word that has E in position 3 and a different fourth letter? 

For example, ""STELA"" -> but A is forbidden? And not ending with L? 

""STEDE"" -> not ending with L? 

""SUET"" -> not 5 letters? 

""SAYED"" -> not? 

So the common ones are the ones with double L at the end? 

But we don't know the second letter? 

We can try ""SMELL"" as a guess? 

But we have to consider that we might be wrong? 

Alternatively, we can try to get more information by using a word that has E in position 3 and then two new letters that are not L? But we need to end with L? So the fourth letter must be a letter that can come before L? 

For example, ""SPELT"" -> but P is forbidden? And not ending with L? 

""SKELM"" -> not ending with L? 

""SKELF"" -> not a word? 

""SKELP"" -> not ending with L? 

""SNELL"" -> but N is forbidden? 

So we are left with the ""S_ E L L"" pattern? 

Therefore, the secret word is likely one of: SHELL, SWELL, SMELL.

We can try one of them? 

But we have three possibilities? We can try ""SMELL"" and if it's not, then we have two left? 

But we have 4 guesses left? So we can do that? 

But we can also try a word that tests the second letter? 

For example, we can try a word that has E in position 3 and then uses a new letter in position 2 and a new letter in position 4? But we don't know if position 4 is L or not? 

But we know that in the secret word, position 4 is not E? But it could be L? Or it could be something else? 

But from the common words, it seems that position 4 is often L? 

But let's try to find a word that fits the pattern and has E in position 3 and a different fourth letter? 

For example, ""SUEDE"" -> not ending with L? 

""SAVES"" -> not? 

""SHEDS"" -> not? 

""SEEMS"" -> not? 

""SOEURS"" -> not 5 letters? 

It's hard? 

Another idea: ""SHELF"" -> S H E L F? Then positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:E, 4:L, 5:F? But we need position 5 to be L? But here it's F? So not? 

""SHOED"" -> not? 

So maybe the only possibilities are the ones with double L? 

Therefore, I think we should guess one of them? 

But which one? 

We can try ""SHELL"" because it's common? 

But we can also try a word that uses new letters to test? 

But we have to include E in position 3? And end with L? And avoid forbidden letters? 

We can try ""SMELL"" because M is a common letter? 

But let's see the feedback we would get? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have L in position 4? To test if position 4 is L? 

For example, we can try a word like ""SMEAR"" -> but A is forbidden? And not ending with L? 

""STEAM"" -> not? 

""SPEED"" -> not? 

It's difficult? 

Another word: ""STELL"" -> not a word? 

""SKELM"" -> not? 

I think we have to go with one of the three: SHELL, SWELL, SMELL.

We can try ""SMELL"" as a guess? 

But note: in ""SMELL"", we have M at position 2? And E at position 3? And L at position 4 and 5? 

But we know position 5 is L? So if we guess ""SMELL"", then:

- Position 1: S -> should be ✓ (we know it is)
- Position 2: M -> if the secret word is ""SMELL"", then ✓; if ""SHELL"", then x; if ""SWELL"", then x.
- Position 3: E -> should be ✓ in all cases? Because we think E is at position 3? 
- Position 4: L -> if the secret word has L at position 4? Then ✓? But if the secret word is ""SHELL"", then position 4 is L? Similarly for ""SWELL"" and ""SMELL""? So in all three, position 4 is L? Then we would get a ✓? 
- Position 5: L -> ✓ (we know)

But wait, if the secret word is ""SHELL"", then when we guess ""SMELL"", we would get:
  S(✓), M(x) because H is the second letter? Then E(✓) because E is at position 3? Then L(✓) at position 4? And L(✓) at position 5? 

Similarly, if it's ""SWELL"", then M would be x? 

And if it's ""SMELL"", then all ✓? 

So by guessing ""SMELL"", we can distinguish:

- If we get all ✓, then we win? 
- If we get S(✓), M(x), E(✓), L(✓), L(✓), then we know the second letter is not M? Then it could be H or W? 
- Then we can guess between ""SHELL"" and ""SWELL"" next? 

But we have 4 guesses left? So we can do that? 

But we also have to consider that there might be other words? For example, ""FREED"" -> not? 

Or ""STEED"" -> not? 

I think it's safe? 

But what about ""ODDLE"" -> not? 

Another possibility: ""SLEPT"" -> but P is forbidden? 

""SLYLY"" -> no E? 

So I think the main ones are the three? 

Therefore, I will guess ""SMELL"". 

But let's confirm the letters: 
  S, M, E, L, L? 
  We are avoiding C,R,A,N,P,I? Yes. 
  We are placing E at position 3? 
  And we are testing M? 

So it's a good guess? 

But we are repeating L? But we know L is at position 5? And we are putting L at position 4? We don't know if that's correct? 

But if we get a ✓ for L at position 4, then we know? 

So I think it's a good guess. 

Therefore, the third guess: ""SMELL""

But note: we are using two L's? But we know one L is at position 5? So if the secret word has only one L, then we would get a x for the L at position 4? But in our candidate words, they all have two L's? 

But what if there is a word with only one L? For example, ""SLEET"" -> but E at position 4? Forbidden? And not ending with L? 

""SEVEN"" -> not? 

I think it's safe? 

So let's go with ""SMELL"". 

<guess>smell</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(❌) R(❌) A(❌) N(❌) E(➖)  
  Interpretation:  
  - ❌ = C, R, A, N are **not** in the secret word.  
  - ➖ = E is in the secret word but **not in position 5**.  

- **Guess 2: SPIEL**  
  Feedback: S(✓) P(❌) I(❌) E(➖) L(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - ✓ = S is in the secret word and **correctly placed at position 1**.  
  - ❌ = P and I are **not** in the secret word.  
  - ➖ = E is in the secret word but **not in position 4**.  
  - ✓ = L is in the secret word and **correctly placed at position 5**.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed Positions**:  
   - Position 1 = **S** (confirmed ✓).  
   - Position 5 = **L** (confirmed ✓).  
   - The secret word pattern is: **S _ _ _ L**.  

2. **Confirmed Letter**:  
   - **E** is in the word but **cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5** (positions 1 and 5 are fixed, and position 4 was tested and rejected).  
   - Therefore, E must be in **position 2 or 3**.  

3. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - C, R, A, N, P, I are **not** in the word (all marked ❌).  

4. **Remaining Possibilities**:  
   - The secret word must be of the form **S X Y Z L**, where:  
     - One of X (position 2) or Y (position 3) must be **E**.  
     - Z (position 4) cannot be E (as per Guess 2 feedback).  
     - X, Y, Z must be letters not in the excluded list (e.g., B, D, G, H, K, M, O, T, U, W, Y).  
   - Common words fitting this pattern include **SHELL**, **SWELL**, and **SMELL** (all have E in position 3 and double L at the end).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test Position 3 for E**: Since E must be in position 2 or 3, placing E in position 3 (as in **SMELL**) tests the most likely scenario based on common words.  
- **Test New Letters**: Use **M** (position 2) and **L** (position 4) to gather new information:  
  - If M is correct (✓), it supports **SMELL**.  
  - If M is absent (❌), it rules out **SMELL** and points to **SHELL** or **SWELL** (where position 2 is H or W).  
- **Efficiency**: Guessing **SMELL** leverages the fixed S and L, tests E's position, and uses new letters (M) to narrow down possibilities quickly.

Choose a word that includes E (but not at the end) and avoids the letters C, R, A, N.\n 2. We want to include other common letters to maximize information.\n\n Considering the English alphabet frequency, I should consider other common letters not yet tried: T, O, I, S, L, U, D, etc.\n\n A good approach is to pick a word that places E in one of the positions 1-4 and uses new common letters.\n\n Also, note that the secret word does not have any of C, R, A, N, so we must avoid these.\n\n Let me think of words that contain E and are 5 letters long, without C, R, A, N.\n\n Example words: \n   ""SPINE"" -> but this has E at the end, which we know is not the position? Actually, our feedback says E is in the word but not in the last position. So our new guess must have E not at position 5? But note: the feedback doesn\'t say that E isn\'t at position 5 in the secret word? Actually, the feedback says that in our first guess E was at position 5 and it was present but in the wrong position. Therefore, in the secret word, E is not at position 5. It can be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, in our new guess, we may place E elsewhere to test other positions.\n\n But note: we have no constraints on where E can be placed in our guess because we are allowed to test different positions. However, since we know E is in the word but not at pos 5, we may want to try it in other positions to get more positional information.\n\n However, we have limited information so we might try a word that has E in a different position (say, position 1 or 2) to see if it gets a ✓ or -.\n\n What are common words without C, R, A, N?\n Some ideas: \n   ""TIMES"" -> T, I, M, E, S -> but E is at position 4? This word has E at position 4? Actually ""TIMES"" is T(1), I(2), M(3), E(4), S(5). We avoid C, R, A, N.\n\n However, let me think about the feedback we might get: \n   If we put E at position 4, and if the secret word has E at say position 1, then we would get a \'-\' for E (since it\'s in the word but at wrong position). And then we know that position 4 isn\'t E? But we are testing E at position 4, and if we get a \'-\', that means E is in the word but not at position 4? But we already know E is not at position 5? Or perhaps place E at position 1 to see if it\'s correct.\n\n Alternatively, let me consider the word ""DEUCE"" -> contains C? We cannot have C. So discard.\n\n Let me think of words that have E and common letters:\n\n Good options:\n   ""QUERY"" -> but contains R (forbidden) and Q and Y are less common? Also, we know R is out.\n   ""OPENS"" -> O, P, E, N, S -> but contains N? We know N is out.\n\n We must avoid C, R, A, N.\n\n Another word: ""SPIEL"" -> S, P, I, E, L -> no forbidden letters. E at position 4? But we can use that.\n\n Or ""BELIE"" -> B, E, L, I, E -> but E at positions 2 and 5? Position 5 might be problematic because we know E isn\'t at position 5? Actually, we cannot have E at position 5? So having E at position 5 again in our guess would be a waste? Because we know from the feedback that E is not in position 5? Well, actually the feedback for the first word: E was marked as \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not at position 5? But it doesn\'t say anything about whether it can be at position 5 again? Actually, we know exactly: the secret word has E but not at position 5. So we can still include E at position 5 in a guess? However, that would not be efficient because we would expect that E is not at position 5? So we should try E at positions 1,2,3,4.\n\n Therefore, let\'s avoid having E at position 5.\n\n So, words with E at positions 1-4 without C,R,A,N.\n\n Options:\n   ""SPIEL"" -> positions: S(1), P(2), I(3), E(4), L(5). E at position 4.\n   ""QUEST"" -> Q, U, E, S, T -> E at position 3? But Q and U might be less common? And avoids C,R,A,N.\n   ""TEETH"" -> T, E, E, T, H -> E at positions 2 and 3. But we have repeated letters? Not ideal because it might not maximize information per unique letter? Also, the word ""TEETH"" is valid? But we have repeated T? However, it\'s okay? Actually, in the context, the word must be valid.\n\n However, I want to cover as many new letters as possible. So avoiding repeated letters is better.\n\n After thinking, I choose ""SPIEL"":\n   S, P, I, E, L -> all new letters? We haven\'t tried S, P, I, or L.\n\n Alternative: ""DOZEN"" -> contains N? Forbidden.\n\n Another: ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> avoids forbidden letters? No C,R,A,N? And E at position 4? This seems good. But we can also consider ""GUESS"" -> G, U, E, S, S -> has double S? Not ideal.\n\n Alternatively: ""BETTY"" -> B, E, T, T, Y -> repeated T, and Y might not be common.\n\n I think ""SPIEL"" is a good choice: \n   It covers S, P, I, L and reuses E (but we know E is in the word so we are testing position 4? But we haven\'t tested E at position 4 in the first guess? Actually, we placed E at position 5. And now we are placing E at position 4? This will tell us if E is at position 4 or not? Or if it\'s elsewhere? And we get information about S, P, I, L.\n\n So, I decide to guess ""SPIEL"".\n\n However, note: we have only 6 tries? We must be efficient. But also, since we are covering new letters, it\'s good.\n\n Another possibility: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E. But E at the end? Avoid.\n\n Or ""EYING"" -> E at position 1, but contains G and N? N is forbidden? No: E,Y,I,N,G -> N is in there? Forbidden? N is forbidden? No: in ""EYING"", it has N? Then cannot since we know N is not in the secret word.\n\n So, ""SPIEL"" seems safe: no C,R,A,N.\n\n Therefore, the second guess: ""SPIEL""\n\n<guess>spiel</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, R, A, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked ❌).\n- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ➖).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **E** (since it\'s confirmed to be in the word), but **avoid positions 5** and the excluded letters (**C, R, A, N**).\n- Focus on testing **new common letters** (e.g., **S, T, L, I, O, P**) to gather more information.\n- Choose a word with E in a position not tested before (positions 1–4) to narrow down its location.\n\nSelected **SPIEL** for the second guess because:\n- Places E in **position 4** (previously untested position).\n- Uses new common letters: **S, P, I, L**.\n- No repeat letters, maximizing letter coverage.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (**C, R, A, N**).\n\n<guess>spiel</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: spiel -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) I(x) E(-) L(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\n1.

So we might want to test that.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use a word that has E in one of the positions and then other common letters to get more information.\n\nLet me list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nThe word must be: S _ _ _ L, with E in either position 2 or 3, and the fourth letter is not E and not one of the forbidden (C,R,A,N,P,I).\n\nPossible words:\n\nIf E is in position 2: S E _ _ L\n  Then the word is S E X Y L, where X and Y are letters that are not forbidden and not E (and X cannot be E? Actually, E is already used? But we don\'t know if there is a second E? The feedback doesn\'t say anything about multiple E\'s? But in the first guess, we had only one E? Actually, we don\'t know. We only know that E is present at least once.\n\nBut in the second guess, we had only one E? And it was at position 4? So we don\'t know if there are more E\'s? However, we are not restricted.\n\nBut to be safe, we should consider that there might be only one E? Or multiple? We don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s think of words:\n\nS E _ _ L: \n  Examples: \n    ""SEWEL"" -> but W and E? But E is already at position 2? Then the last two are W and E? But we have L at the end? Actually, it\'s S E W E L? But that would be 5 letters? ""SEWEL"" is S-E-W-E-L? But then we have two E\'s? And the fourth letter is E? But we know from the second guess that position 4 is not E? So ""SEWEL"" would have E at position 4? That is forbidden? So we cannot have E at position 4.\n\nSo in S E _ _ L, the third and fourth letters must not be E? Because if E were at position 4, we already know it\'s not allowed? And position 3 could be E? But then we have two E\'s? But we don\'t know if that\'s allowed? The secret word might have two E\'s? But we haven\'t seen any evidence? However, we cannot rule out.\n\nBut we know for sure that position 4 is not E? So in S E _ _ L, the fourth letter must not be E. The third letter can be E? But then we have E at position 2 and 3? That is possible? But let\'s see the feedback: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was present? And in the second guess, we had E at position 4 and it was present? But if the word had E at position 2 and 3, then when we put E at position 4, it would still be present? But we got a \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not at position 4? So that\'s consistent? And if we put E at position 5 in the first guess, it would be present? So having two E\'s is possible? But we don\'t know.\n\nHowever, we must avoid having E at position 4? So in our next guess, we should not put E at position 4? But we are going to put E at either 2 or 3? So that\'s fine.\n\nBut we don\'t know if E is at position 2 or 3? So we need to test.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has E in position 2 and then two new letters? Or in position 3 and two new letters? And then we can see the feedback.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we have only 4 guesses left? We need to be efficient.\n\nLet me think of common words that fit the pattern.\n\nFirst, if E is in position 2: S E _ _ L\n  Possible words: \n    ""SEWEL"" -> but has E at position 4? Not allowed? Because we know position 4 is not E? So invalid? Actually, ""SEWEL"" has E at position 2 and 4? But position 4 is E? We know that position 4 is not E? So we cannot use that? And also, it\'s invalid for the secret word? Because the secret word cannot have E at position 4? So the secret word cannot be ""SEWEL""? So we can skip.\n\n  ""SEBUM"" -> but B, U, M? And not a common word? Probably not.\n\n  ""SEDUL"" -> not a word? \n\n  ""SEGOL"" -> not common? \n\n  ""SEXTL"" -> not a word.\n\n  ""SELLY"" -> but has L at position 3? But we already have L at position 5? And we don\'t know if L can be repeated? But in the second guess, we had L at position 5 and it was correct? So if we have L at position 3, that would be a different L? But the secret word might have two L\'s? We don\'t know? But in ""spiel"", we had L at position 5 and it was correct? And we didn\'t have any other L? So we don\'t know? But we can have repeated letters? Yes, it\'s possible.\n\n  However, ""SELLY"" is S E L L Y? Then positions: \n      S(1)=S (correct), \n      E(2)=E? (if E is in the word, but we are testing E at position 2? and then L at position 3 and 4? and Y at position 5? But we have L at position 5? So position 5 is L? So if we have L at position 3 and 4, that\'s okay? But the word would be ""SELLY""? Is that a word? It might be? But let\'s check: ""Selly"" is not a standard word? I think ""silly"" is a word? But ""silly"" has I? But I is forbidden? So not.\n\n  Actually, ""SELLY"" is not a common word? We should stick to common words.\n\n  More common: ""SETTL"" -> not a word? ""SETUP"" -> but P is forbidden? And not ending with L? \n\n  This is hard? Maybe E is not in position 2? \n\nNow, if E is in position 3: S _ E _ L\n  Then the word is S X E Y L, where X and Y are letters (not forbidden, and Y not E? because position 4 cannot be E?).\n\n  Examples:\n    ""SUEDE"" -> but ends with E? We need to end with L? Not.\n    ""SHELL"" -> S H E L L? Then positions: \n        S(1)=S (correct)\n        H(2)=? \n        E(3)=E (if E is at position 3, then it would be correct? but we don\'t know if E is at 3? we are testing)\n        L(4)=L? but we have L at position 5? So if we have L at position 4 and 5? That would be repeated? \n        And the word is ""SHELL"", which is valid? But we have L at position 4? And we know that position 5 is L? So if the secret word is ""SHELL"", then position 5 is L? And position 4 is L? So when we guessed ""spiel"", we had L at position 5 and it was correct? But we didn\'t have L at position 4? So we don\'t know about position 4? \n\n  But in ""SHELL"", we have E at position 3? And we have S at 1 and L at 5? And the fourth letter is L? \n\n  But we also have H? \n\n  However, we are not sure? \n\n  Another common word: ""STEEL"" -> but has T and E? But E at position 3 and 4? But position 4 is E? We know position 4 cannot be E? So invalid? \n\n  ""STELL"" -> not a word? \n\n  ""SWELL"" -> S W E L L? Then positions: 1:S, 2:W, 3:E, 4:L, 5:L? But we have L at position 4 and 5? And we know position 5 is L? So if the secret word is ""SWELL"", then when we guessed ""spiel"", we had L at position 5 and it was correct? But we didn\'t have L at position 4? So that\'s okay? But the word ""SWELL"" has E at position 3? And position 4 is L? Which is not E? So that\'s allowed? \n\n  But is ""SWELL"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n  However, we don\'t know if the secret word has two L\'s? \n\n  Another word: ""SMELL"" -> S M E L L? Similarly.\n\n  But we have to avoid the forbidden letters? P is forbidden? But M is not? \n\n  Also, ""SHOAL"" -> but no E? We must have E? So not.\n\n  ""STOLE"" -> but ends with E? We need L at the end? Not.\n\n  ""STILL"" -> has I? Forbidden? I is not allowed? Because in guess2, I was marked x? So not.\n\n  ""SPELL"" -> but P is forbidden? Not.\n\n  So possible words: \n      SWELL, SMELL, SHELL, etc.\n\nBut we don\'t know which one? \n\nWe need to make a guess that will help us distinguish? \n\nWe have to consider that E might be in position 2? But we couldn\'t find many common words with E in position 2? \n\nAnother word with E in position 2: ""SEAML"" -> not a word? ""SEPAL"" -> but P is forbidden? ""SEXED"" -> not ending with L? \n\n""SEIZE"" -> ends with E? Not.\n\n""SELLE"" -> not a word? \n\nSo maybe E is more likely in position 3? \n\nBut we need to test.\n\nWe can try a word that has E in position 3 and then two new letters? For example, ""SMELL"" or ""SWELL""? But we have to avoid using forbidden letters? And we want to test new letters? \n\nBut we have only 4 guesses left? We can try one of these? But if we guess ""SWELL"" and it\'s not the word, we get feedback? \n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t assume E in position 3? But we know E is in position 2 or 3? So we can try to put E in position 2 in our guess? But we don\'t know? \n\nWe can choose a word that has E in position 2 and then two new letters? But we need to find one? \n\nLet me think: ""SEWEL"" is invalid? Because of position 4? \n\n""SEVEN"" -> not ending with L? \n\n""SEGUE"" -> not ending with L? \n\n""SELLE"" -> not a word? \n\n""SETTL"" -> not a word? \n\n""SEPTL"" -> not a word? \n\nSo maybe there are no common words with E in position 2 and ending with L? \n\nTherefore, it\'s more likely that E is in position 3? \n\nSo the secret word is probably S _ E _ L, with the second letter being a letter that is not forbidden and the fourth letter being a letter that is not forbidden and not E? \n\nAnd the fourth letter could be L? Then we have two L\'s? \n\nSo let\'s list possible words: \n  SHELL: S H E L L\n  SWELL: S W E L L\n  SMELL: S M E L L\n  SPELL: but P is forbidden? \n  STEEL: but E at position 4? Forbidden? \n  STILL: I is forbidden? \n  SKELP: not ending with L? \n  SKELF: not a word? \n  SHIEL: not a word? \n  ""SMELL"" and ""SWELL"" and ""SHELL"" are the main ones? \n\nBut we also have ""DUELS"" -> not starting with S? \n\nWe need to test one of these? But we can also test a word that has E in position 3 and a different fourth letter? \n\nFor example, ""STELA"" -> but A is forbidden? And not ending with L? \n\n""STEDE"" -> not ending with L? \n\n""SUET"" -> not 5 letters? \n\n""SAYED"" -> not? \n\nSo the common ones are the ones with double L at the end? \n\nBut we don\'t know the second letter? \n\nWe can try ""SMELL"" as a guess? \n\nBut we have to consider that we might be wrong? \n\nAlternatively, we can try to get more information by using a word that has E in position 3 and then two new letters that are not L? But we need to end with L? So the fourth letter must be a letter that can come before L? \n\nFor example, ""SPELT"" -> but P is forbidden? And not ending with L? \n\n""SKELM"" -> not ending with L? \n\n""SKELF"" -> not a word? \n\n""SKELP"" -> not ending with L? \n\n""SNELL"" -> but N is forbidden? \n\nSo we are left with the ""S_ E L L"" pattern? \n\nTherefore, the secret word is likely one of: SHELL, SWELL, SMELL.\n\nWe can try one of them? \n\nBut we have three possibilities? We can try ""SMELL"" and if it\'s not, then we have two left? \n\nBut we have 4 guesses left? So we can do that? \n\nBut we can also try a word that tests the second letter? \n\nFor example, we can try a word that has E in position 3 and then uses a new letter in position 2 and a new letter in position 4? But we don\'t know if position 4 is L or not? \n\nBut we know that in the secret word, position 4 is not E? But it could be L? Or it could be something else? \n\nBut from the common words, it seems that position 4 is often L? \n\nBut let\'s try to find a word that fits the pattern and has E in position 3 and a different fourth letter? \n\nFor example, ""SUEDE"" -> not ending with L? \n\n""SAVES"" -> not? \n\n""SHEDS"" -> not? \n\n""SEEMS"" -> not? \n\n""SOEURS"" -> not 5 letters? \n\nIt\'s hard? \n\nAnother idea: ""SHELF"" -> S H E L F? Then positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:E, 4:L, 5:F? But we need position 5 to be L? But here it\'s F? So not? \n\n""SHOED"" -> not? \n\nSo maybe the only possibilities are the ones with double L? \n\nTherefore, I think we should guess one of them? \n\nBut which one? \n\nWe can try ""SHELL"" because it\'s common? \n\nBut we can also try a word that uses new letters to test? \n\nBut we have to include E in position 3? And end with L? And avoid forbidden letters? \n\nWe can try ""SMELL"" because M is a common letter? \n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we would get? \n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t have L in position 4? To test if position 4 is L? \n\nFor example, we can try a word like ""SMEAR"" -> but A is forbidden? And not ending with L? \n\n""STEAM"" -> not? \n\n""SPEED"" -> not? \n\nIt\'s difficult? \n\nAnother word: ""STELL"" -> not a word? \n\n""SKELM"" -> not? \n\nI think we have to go with one of the three: SHELL, SWELL, SMELL.\n\nWe can try ""SMELL"" as a guess? \n\nBut note: in ""SMELL"", we have M at position 2? And E at position 3? And L at position 4 and 5? \n\nBut we know position 5 is L? So if we guess ""SMELL"", then:\n\n- Position 1: S -> should be ✓ (we know it is)\n- Position 2: M -> if the secret word is ""SMELL"", then ✓; if ""SHELL"", then x; if ""SWELL"", then x.\n- Position 3: E -> should be ✓ in all cases? Because we think E is at position 3? \n- Position 4: L -> if the secret word has L at position 4? Then ✓? But if the secret word is ""SHELL"", then position 4 is L? Similarly for ""SWELL"" and ""SMELL""? So in all three, position 4 is L? Then we would get a ✓? \n- Position 5: L -> ✓ (we know)\n\nBut wait, if the secret word is ""SHELL"", then when we guess ""SMELL"", we would get:\n  S(✓), M(x) because H is the second letter? Then E(✓) because E is at position 3? Then L(✓) at position 4? And L(✓) at position 5? \n\nSimilarly, if it\'s ""SWELL"", then M would be x? \n\nAnd if it\'s ""SMELL"", then all ✓? \n\nSo by guessing ""SMELL"", we can distinguish:\n\n- If we get all ✓, then we win? \n- If we get S(✓), M(x), E(✓), L(✓), L(✓), then we know the second letter is not M? Then it could be H or W? \n- Then we can guess between ""SHELL"" and ""SWELL"" next? \n\nBut we have 4 guesses left? So we can do that? \n\nBut we also have to consider that there might be other words? For example, ""FREED"" -> not? \n\nOr ""STEED"" -> not? \n\nI think it\'s safe? \n\nBut what about ""ODDLE"" -> not? \n\nAnother possibility: ""SLEPT"" -> but P is forbidden? \n\n""SLYLY"" -> no E? \n\nSo I think the main ones are the three? \n\nTherefore, I will guess ""SMELL"". \n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters: \n  S, M, E, L, L? \n  We are avoiding C,R,A,N,P,I? Yes. \n  We are placing E at position 3? \n  And we are testing M? \n\nSo it\'s a good guess? \n\nBut we are repeating L? But we know L is at position 5? And we are putting L at position 4? We don\'t know if that\'s correct? \n\nBut if we get a ✓ for L at position 4, then we know? \n\nSo I think it\'s a good guess. \n\nTherefore, the third guess: ""SMELL""\n\nBut note: we are using two L\'s? But we know one L is at position 5? So if the secret word has only one L, then we would get a x for the L at position 4? But in our candidate words, they all have two L\'s? \n\nBut what if there is a word with only one L? For example, ""SLEET"" -> but E at position 4? Forbidden? And not ending with L? \n\n""SEVEN"" -> not? \n\nI think it\'s safe? \n\nSo let\'s go with ""SMELL"". \n\n<guess>smell</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: CRANE**  \n  Feedback: C(❌) R(❌) A(❌) N(❌) E(➖)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - ❌ = C, R, A, N are **not** in the secret word.  \n  - ➖ = E is in the secret word but **not in position 5**.  \n\n- **Guess 2: SPIEL**  \n  Feedback: S(✓) P(❌) I(❌) E(➖) L(✓)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - ✓ = S is in the secret word and **correctly placed at position 1**.  \n  - ❌ = P and I are **not** in the secret word.  \n  - ➖ = E is in the secret word but **not in position 4**.  \n  - ✓ = L is in the secret word and **correctly placed at position 5**.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Fixed Positions**:  \n   - Position 1 = **S** (confirmed ✓).  \n   - Position 5 = **L** (confirmed ✓).  \n   - The secret word pattern is: **S _ _ _ L**.  \n\n2. **Confirmed Letter**:  \n   - **E** is in the word but **cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5** (positions 1 and 5 are fixed, and position 4 was tested and rejected).  \n   - Therefore, E must be in **position 2 or 3**.  \n\n3. **Excluded Letters**:  \n   - C, R, A, N, P, I are **not** in the word (all marked ❌).  \n\n4. **Remaining Possibilities**:  \n   - The secret word must be of the form **S X Y Z L**, where:  \n     - One of X (position 2) or Y (position 3) must be **E**.  \n     - Z (position 4) cannot be E (as per Guess 2 feedback).  \n     - X, Y, Z must be letters not in the excluded list (e.g., B, D, G, H, K, M, O, T, U, W, Y).  \n   - Common words fitting this pattern include **SHELL**, **SWELL**, and **SMELL** (all have E in position 3 and double L at the end).  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- **Test Position 3 for E**: Since E must be in position 2 or 3, placing E in position 3 (as in **SMELL**) tests the most likely scenario based on common words.  \n- **Test New Letters**: Use **M** (position 2) and **L** (position 4) to gather new information:  \n  - If M is correct (✓), it supports **SMELL**.  \n  - If M is absent (❌), it rules out **SMELL** and points to **SHELL** or **SWELL** (where position 2 is H or W).  \n- **Efficiency**: Guessing **SMELL** leverages the fixed S and L, tests E\'s position, and uses new letters (M) to narrow down possibilities quickly.  \n\n### Guess:\n\n<guess>smell</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: spiel -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) I(x) E(-) L(✓)\nGuess 3: smell -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) M(x) E(✓) L(✓) L(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given the feedback for the third guess ""smell"":
 S(✓) -> S is correct and in position 1 (as we already knew).
 M(x) -> M is not in the secret word.
 E(✓) -> E is correct and in position 3 (so now we know E is at position 3).
 L(✓) for both the 4th and 5th letters? Wait, the feedback is given per letter: 
   The word ""smell"" has two L's? So the feedback is for each position.

 The feedback string: ""S(✓) M(x) E(✓) L(✓) L(✓)"" 
 This means:
   Position 1: S -> ✓ (correct)
   Position 2: M -> x (not in the word)
   Position 3: E -> ✓ (correct and in position)
   Position 4: L -> ✓ (correct and in position)
   Position 5: L -> ✓ (correct and in position)

 So, we now know:
   The secret word is: S _ E L L

 We are missing only the second letter.

 We also know that the second letter cannot be any of the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, P, I, M (from previous feedback).

 Additionally, we know that the secret word has E at position 3 and L at positions 4 and 5.

 The word is S?ELL.

 We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: S _ E L L.

 The second letter must be a letter that is not in the excluded set: C, R, A, N, P, I, M.

 Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

 Common letters for the second position: B, D, G, H, K, O, T, U, W, Y, etc.

 We can list possible words:
   SHELL -> H is not excluded? H is not in the excluded list? (excluded: C,R,A,N,P,I,M) -> H is allowed.
   SWELL -> W is allowed.
   Other possibilities? 
     ""SPELL"" -> but P is excluded? So not.
     ""STELL"" -> not a common word? But let's check: ""stell"" is a word? It means to set or place? But we have to use common words? 
     ""SKELL"" -> not common? 
     ""SDELL"" -> not a word.

 The most common words are SHELL and SWELL.

 But we have to choose one? We can guess one of them? 

 However, we have 3 guesses left? We can try one? 

 But note: we have two possibilities? So we can try ""SHELL"" and if it's not, then ""SWELL"" next? 

 But we can also try to use a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have one letter missing? 

 Alternatively, we can guess ""SHELL"" now? 

 But let's see: if we guess ""SHELL"", then:
   If it's correct, we win.
   If not, then we know it must be ""SWELL"", because those are the only two common words? 

 Are there others? 
   ""SHILL"" -> but I is excluded? Not.
   ""SKILL"" -> I is excluded? Not.
   ""STILL"" -> I excluded? Not.
   ""SMALL"" -> A excluded? Not.
   ""SPILL"" -> P and I excluded? Not.
   ""SWILL"" -> W is allowed? But ""SWILL"" is S W I L L -> but I is excluded? So not.

 So only SHELL and SWELL? 

 What about ""SELLS""? -> but that would be S E L L S? But we need the pattern S _ E L L? So the third letter must be E? And ""SELLS"" has E at position 2? Not at 3? So not.

 Therefore, the only two common words are SHELL and SWELL.

 We can guess ""SHELL"" because it's more common? Or we can guess ""SWELL""? 

 Since we have no information about H or W, we can choose arbitrarily? 

 But note: we have already tried M? And we haven't tried H or W? So we can try one? 

 I'll choose ""SHELL"" as the next guess.
