We are starting a new game. We have 6 tries to guess a 5-letter word.
 Since this is the first guess, we don't have any prior feedback. We should choose a word that can provide a lot of information.
 A good starting word often uses common letters and has a balanced set of vowels and consonants.

 Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters and covers three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N). 
 Alternatively, ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", ""ADIEU"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as the first guess because:
   C: common consonant
   R: common consonant
   A: common vowel
   N: common consonant
   E: common vowel

 However, note that the example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we avoid using those to maintain unpredictability.

 After consideration, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 So the first guess will be: CRANE
</think>
I need to make an effective first guess to gather initial information about the secret word. The ideal starting word should:
- Include commonly used letters to maximize feedback potential
- Cover multiple vowels and consonants to test common patterns
- Avoid repeating letters to check more unique characters

After reviewing common Wordle strategies, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROATE"" are often recommended. I'll choose **""CRANE""** because it:
- Includes three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N)
- Contains letters that frequently appear in English words
- Avoids redundancy with all unique letters
This gives a balanced starting point to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback symbols (✓, -, or x).

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x -> not in the word
  R: x -> not in the word
  A: - -> in the word but in the wrong position
  N: x -> not in the word
  E: ✓ -> correct letter in the correct position

 So, we know:
  - E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5).
  - A is in the word but not in position 3 (because that's where we guessed it and it was wrong position). Since our guess had A in the 3rd position, the secret word has A somewhere else (positions 1,2,3,4) but note position 3 is excluded because the feedback was wrong position? Actually: 
    The feedback for A is '-', meaning the letter A is in the word but not in the position we guessed (which was position 3 in ""crane""). So in the secret word, A is present but not at position 3. It could be at position 1,2,4 or even 5? But wait, position 5 is already E and it's fixed, so A cannot be at position 5. Thus A must be at position 1,2 or 4.
  - The letters C, R, N are not in the word at all.

 Also, note that E is fixed at position 5.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Ends with E (since E is at position 5 and is correct)
   - Includes the letter A (because we know A is in the word) but not at position 3.
   - Does not include C, R, N.

 Our goal is to try to place A in a different position and also test new letters.

 Let's think of words ending with E that contain A (but not at position 3) and without C, R, N.

 Positions:
   Position 1: unknown
   Position 2: unknown
   Position 3: unknown (but note: we know it's not A)
   Position 4: unknown (but could be A)
   Position 5: E

 We also need to avoid using C, R, N.

 Since E is fixed at the end, we can focus on the first four positions.

 What words do we know that end in E and have an A?

 Examples: 
   ALIVE, ALONE, ABATE, ABASE, ADAGE, AGATE, etc. but we cannot use R (so ALONE has R? Actually ALONE has no R, let me check: A, L, O, N, E -> but we also know N is not in the word. Wait, we got N as 'x', so we cannot use N. Therefore ALONE is invalid because it has N.

 Another: ALIVE -> A, L, I, V, E -> letters: A, L, I, V, E. None of C, R, N. So it's valid.

 We can consider ""ALIVE"":
   - A at position 1: might be a good place to test A? But remember A was not at position 3 in the previous word, but we don't know about position 1. If we put A at position 1 and the secret word has A at position 1, then we get a ✓ for A. If A is actually at position 2 or 4, then we would get a '-' for A.

 However, note that in our feedback for the first guess: the A was placed at position 3 and was wrong. So if the secret word has A at position 1, then when we guess ""ALIVE"", A will be at position 1 and that might be the correct position? Or maybe it's at position 2 or 4.

 Another candidate: ""ABASE"" -> A, B, A, S, E -> contains two A's? But we don't know if there are two A's. Also, we have to consider that our first guess with A had only one A and the feedback for A was '-'. What if the secret word has two A's? Then we would have gotten one '-' for the A we placed at position 3 and the other A at a different position wouldn't have been revealed because we didn't guess it. However, it's safer to assume single letter unless evidence for duplication. 

 But note: ""ABASE"" has two A's and we don't know if there's duplication. Also, we haven't tested S? We have S in ""ABASE"".

 Actually, we haven't tested any of these letters (besides A and E) because our first guess was ""CRANE"". So we have no information on L, I, V, B, S, etc.

 Also, we know the secret word does not have C, R, N.

 Alternative: Since we know A is present and E is fixed at position 5, we can try a word that moves A to other positions to test.

 Consider: 
   Position 1: A? Then we can pick a word starting with A and ending with E: e.g., AWAKE? But W and K are new.

   Position 2: A? Then word: _A__E, e.g., ""MAZES"" but we don't know about Z (rare). Or ""LATHE"", ""GAVEL"", ""HASTE"", etc.

   Position 4: A? Then word: ___AE, e.g., ""PLANE"" but has N (not allowed) and L.

 However, considering we want to test as many new letters as possible, I think ""ALIVE"" is a good candidate because:
   - A is at position 1: if it's correct, we fix A. If it's not, then we get information that A must be at position 2 or 4 (since the secret word must have A).
   - It introduces new letters: L, I, V.

 Alternatively, we might choose ""HASTE"": 
   H, A, S, T, E -> positions: 
      Position 2: A (so testing A at position 2)
   And H, S, T are new.

 But note: in ""HASTE"", position 5 is E (which we know is fixed).

 However, we are missing information about the rest. We have only two knowns: A is somewhere else (not pos3) and E is fixed.

 Another good candidate: ""PLATE""? 
   P, L, A, T, E -> note: A is at position 3? But wait, we guessed A at position 3 before and it was wrong. Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 3 again? 
   However, we want to test A at different positions? Actually, we already know that the secret word's A is not at position 3, so repeating A at position 3 would be futile? 

 Wait, no: we must not put A at position 3 again because we already know it's not there. So in a new word, we can put A anywhere except position 3? 
 Actually, we can put A wherever we want to test? We might even test if there are multiple A's? 

 But note: the feedback for our first guess: only one A was in the word? Actually, we don't know if there are multiple A's. But our guess had only one A and we got one '-' for A. If there were two A's, we would have gotten two '-' for two guesses? Only if we had guessed two A's? 

 We only guessed one A in ""crane"", so even if there were two A's in the secret word, we would have only one '-' for A because we guessed one A. Therefore, we cannot conclude from that feedback that there is only one A. But we know that the secret word has at least one A.

 So let's not assume duplicates unless we have to.

 Back to ""PLATE"": 
   P, L, A, T, E -> but here we are putting A at position 3. We already know A is not at position 3! So why test the same position? 
   So we should avoid position 3 for A.

 Therefore, we cannot use ""PLATE"" because it puts A at position 3 (the forbidden position). Similarly, ""SLATE"" would put A at position 3.

 How about ""PEACE""? 
   But note: 
      P, E, A, C, E -> 
        Position 2: E -> but we don't have feedback about E at position 2? And indeed we know E at position 5 is correct, but this word has E at position 2 as well? 
        Also, we cannot use C because we know C is not in the word.

 So avoid C.

 What about ""PASTE""? 
   P, A, S, T, E -> 
        Position 1: P
        Position 2: A  (so we are testing A at position 2)
        Position 3: S
        Position 4: T
        Position 5: E -> fixed.

 This word: 
   - avoids C, R, N (letters that are not in the word)
   - has A at position 2 (a new position for A)
   - introduces new letters: P, S, T.

 Similarly, ""HASTE"" would be similar: H, A, S, T, E.

 But note: we are limited by actual words. Both ""PASTE"" and ""HASTE"" are words.

 Another candidate: ""AGAPE""?
   A, G, A, P, E -> but two A's? It's a word. We would test A at position 1 and position 3? But we know A is not at position 3 (so that A at position 3 would be a miss) and then A at position 1 might be hit? But we don't want to introduce duplication unnecessarily? 

 Alternatively, we could go for one of the more common letters: introduce S and T. Since they are common consonants.

 I think ""PASTE"" or ""HASTE"" are both acceptable.

 Let me compare:
   Using ""PASTE"":
        If the secret word has A at position 2, then we get A(✓) and if not then we get A(-) meaning A must be at position 4? because position 1 would also be a possibility? 
        Also, we test P, S, T.

   Using ""ALIVE"":
        A at position 1: if it's ✓, then we fix A at position 1. If it's -, then A must be at position 2 or 4? 
        Also, we test L, I, V.

 We don't have much to go on. Since E is fixed at the end, and we haven't tested many letters, both are reasonable.

 But note: we know the secret word has an A and an E at position 5. The other three letters we haven't encountered.

 Since we only have 5 more tries, we want to maximize information. 

 The letter S is very common. So let me introduce S and T? 

 I think I'll go with ""PASTE"".

 However, wait: what if the secret word has A at position 1? Then with ""PASTE"", we would put A at position 2 and get a '-' for A? Then we know A exists but not at position 2, and combined with the first guess, we know A cannot be at position 3. Then A must be at position 1 or 4? Then we still have ambiguity.

 But with ""ALIVE"" we are testing position 1 for A.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has A at one of the remaining possible positions (1,2,4) and test more common letters. 

 But note: we also have the constraint that E is at position 5.

 After some thought, I'll go with ""PASTE"". Why?
   - It tests three common consonants (P, S, T) and moves A to position 2.
   - If we get a '-' on A again, then we know the A is at position 4? Because position 1 and 4 are left? Actually, we would only know that A is not at position 2. Then together with the first feedback (not at position 3), then A must be at position 1 or 4. Then in the next guess we can test position 4 by placing A at position 4? 

 But also, if we get a ✓ for A at position 2, then we fix A and we are happy.

 So, we'll try ""PASTE"".

<guess>paste</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N**: Not in the secret word (`x`).
- **A**: Present but not in position 3 (`-`), so it must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- **E**: Correct and in position 5 (`✓`).

For the next guess:
- The word must end with **E** (position 5).
- It must include **A** in position 1, 2, or 4.
- It cannot include **C, R, N**.
- To maximize information, new common letters should be tested (e.g., **S, T, P**).

A strong candidate is **PASTE**:
- Ends with **E** (position 5).
- Places **A** in position 2 (testing a new position).
- Introduces **P, S, T** (common letters not yet tested).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N).

 So, we know:
  - E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5).
  - A is in the word but not in position 3 (because that's where we guessed it and it was wrong position). Since our guess had A in the 3rd position, the secret word has A somewhere else (positions 1,2,3,4) but note position 3 is excluded because the feedback was wrong position? Actually:

  - The letters C, R, N are not in the word at all.

 Also, note that E is fixed at position 5.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:

   - Includes the letter A (because we know A is in the word) but not at position 3.
   - Does not include C, R, N.

 Our goal is to try to place A in a different position and also test new letters.

 Let's think of words ending with E that contain A (but not at position 3) and without C, R, N.

 Positions:
   Position 1: unknown
   Position 2: unknown
   Position 3: unknown (but note: we know it's not A)
   Position 4: unknown (but could be A)
   Position 5: E

 We also need to avoid using C, R, N.

 Since E is fixed at the end, we can focus on the first four positions.

 What words do we know that end in E and have an A?

 Examples: 
   ALIVE, ALONE, ABATE, ABASE, ADAGE, AGATE, etc. but we cannot use R (so ALONE has R? Actually ALONE has no R, let me check: A, L, O, N, E -> but we also know N is not in the word. Wait, we got N as 'x', so we cannot use N. Therefore ALONE is invalid because it has N.

 Wait, no: we must not put A at position 3 again because we already know it's not there. So in a new word, we can put A anywhere except position 3? 
 Actually, we can put A wherever we want to test? We might even test if there are multiple A's? 

 But note: the feedback for our first guess: only one A was in the word? Actually, we don't know if there are multiple A's. But our guess had only one A and we got one '-' for A. If there were two A's, we would have gotten two '-' for two guesses? Only if we had guessed two A's? 

 We only guessed one A in ""crane"", so even if there were two A's in the secret word, we would have only one '-' for A because we guessed one A. Therefore, we cannot conclude from that feedback that there is only one A. But we know that the secret word has at least one A.

 So let's not assume duplicates unless we have to.

 Back to ""PLATE"": 
   P, L, A, T, E -> but here we are putting A at position 3. We already know A is not at position 3! So why test the same position? 
   So we should avoid position 3 for A.

 Therefore, we cannot use ""PLATE"" because it puts A at position 3 (the forbidden position). Similarly, ""SLATE"" would put A at position 3.

 How about ""PEACE""? 
   But note: 
      P, E, A, C, E -> 
        Position 2: E -> but we don't have feedback about E at position 2? And indeed we know E at position 5 is correct, but this word has E at position 2 as well? 
        Also, we cannot use C because we know C is not in the word.

 So avoid C.

 What about ""PASTE""? 
   P, A, S, T, E -> 
        Position 1: P
        Position 2: A  (so we are testing A at position 2)
        Position 3: S
        Position 4: T
        Position 5: E -> fixed.

 This word: 
   - avoids C, R, N (letters that are not in the word)
   - has A at position 2 (a new position for A)
   - introduces new letters: P, S, T.

 Similarly, ""HASTE"" would be similar: H, A, S, T, E.

 But note: we are limited by actual words. Both ""PASTE"" and ""HASTE"" are words.

 Another candidate: ""AGAPE""?
   A, G, A, P, E -> but two A's? It's a word. We would test A at position 1 and position 3? But we know A is not at position 3 (so that A at position 3 would be a miss) and then A at position 1 might be hit? But we don't want to introduce duplication unnecessarily? 

 Alternatively, we could go for one of the more common letters: introduce S and T. Since they are common consonants.

 I think ""PASTE"" or ""HASTE"" are both acceptable.

 Let me compare:
   Using ""PASTE"":
        If the secret word has A at position 2, then we get A(✓) and if not then we get A(-) meaning A must be at position 4? because position 1 would also be a possibility? 
        Also, we test P, S, T.

   Using ""ALIVE"":
        A at position 1: if it's ✓, then we fix A at position 1. If it's -, then A must be at position 2 or 4? 
        Also, we test L, I, V.

 We don't have much to go on. Since E is fixed at the end, and we haven't tested many letters, both are reasonable.

 But note: we know the secret word has an A and an E at position 5. The other three letters we haven't encountered.

 Since we only have 5 more tries, we want to maximize information. 

 The letter S is very common. So let me introduce S and T? 

 I think I'll go with ""PASTE"".

 However, wait: what if the secret word has A at position 1? Then with ""PASTE"", we would put A at position 2 and get a '-' for A? Then we know A exists but not at position 2, and combined with the first guess, we know A cannot be at position 3. Then A must be at position 1 or 4? Then we still have ambiguity.

 But with ""ALIVE"" we are testing position 1 for A.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has A at one of the remaining possible positions (1,2,4) and test more common letters. 

 But note: we also have the constraint that E is at position 5.

 After some thought, I'll go with ""PASTE"". Why?
   - It tests three common consonants (P, S, T) and moves A to position 2.
   - If we get a '-' on A again, then we know the A is at position 4? Because position 1 and 4 are left? Actually, we would only know that A is not at position 2. Then together with the first feedback (not at position 3), then A must be at position 1 or 4. Then in the next guess we can test position 4 by placing A at position 4? 

 But also, if we get a ✓ for A at position 2, then we fix A and we are happy.

 So, we'll try ""PASTE"".

<guess>paste</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N**: Not in the secret word (`x`).
- **A**: Present but not in position 3 (`-`), so it must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- **E**: Correct and in position 5 (`✓`).

For the next guess:
- The word must end with **E** (position 5).
- It must include **A** in position 1, 2, or 4.
- It cannot include **C, R, N**.
- To maximize information, new common letters should be tested (e.g., **S, T, P**).

A strong candidate is **PASTE**:
- Ends with **E** (position 5).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. We have 6 tries to guess a 5-letter word.
 Since this is the first guess, we don't have any prior feedback. We should choose a word that can provide a lot of information.
 A good starting word often uses common letters and has a balanced set of vowels and consonants.

 Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters and covers three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N). 
 Alternatively, ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", ""ADIEU"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as the first guess because:
   C: common consonant
   R: common consonant
   A: common vowel
   N: common consonant
   E: common vowel

 However, note that the example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we avoid using those to maintain unpredictability.

 After consideration, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 So the first guess will be: CRANEI need to make an effective first guess to gather initial information about the secret word. The ideal starting word should:
- Include commonly used letters to maximize feedback potential
- Cover multiple vowels and consonants to test common patterns
- Avoid repeating letters to check more unique characters

After reviewing common Wordle strategies, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROATE"" are often recommended. I'll choose **""CRANE""** because it:
- Includes three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N)
- Contains letters that frequently appear in English words
- Avoids redundancy with all unique letters
This gives a balanced starting point to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback symbols (✓, -, or x).

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x -> not in the word
  R: x -> not in the word
  A: - -> in the word but in the wrong position
  N: x -> not in the word
  E: ✓ -> correct letter in the correct position

 So, we know:
  - E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5).
  - A is in the word but not in position 3 (because that's where we guessed it and it was wrong position). Since our guess had A in the 3rd position, the secret word has A somewhere else (positions 1,2,3,4) but note position 3 is excluded because the feedback was wrong position? Actually: 
    The feedback for A is '-', meaning the letter A is in the word but not in the position we guessed (which was position 3 in ""crane""). So in the secret word, A is present but not at position 3. It could be at position 1,2,4 or even 5? But wait, position 5 is already E and it's fixed, so A cannot be at position 5. Thus A must be at position 1,2 or 4.
  - The letters C, R, N are not in the word at all.

 Also, note that E is fixed at position 5.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Ends with E (since E is at position 5 and is correct)
   - Includes the letter A (because we know A is in the word) but not at position 3.
   - Does not include C, R, N.

 Our goal is to try to place A in a different position and also test new letters.

 Let's think of words ending with E that contain A (but not at position 3) and without C, R, N.

 Positions:
   Position 1: unknown
   Position 2: unknown
   Position 3: unknown (but note: we know it's not A)
   Position 4: unknown (but could be A)
   Position 5: E

 We also need to avoid using C, R, N.

 Since E is fixed at the end, we can focus on the first four positions.

 What words do we know that end in E and have an A?

 Examples: 
   ALIVE, ALONE, ABATE, ABASE, ADAGE, AGATE, etc. but we cannot use R (so ALONE has R? Actually ALONE has no R, let me check: A, L, O, N, E -> but we also know N is not in the word. Wait, we got N as 'x', so we cannot use N. Therefore ALONE is invalid because it has N.

 Another: ALIVE -> A, L, I, V, E -> letters: A, L, I, V, E. None of C, R, N. So it's valid.

 We can consider ""ALIVE"":
   - A at position 1: might be a good place to test A? But remember A was not at position 3 in the previous word, but we don't know about position 1. If we put A at position 1 and the secret word has A at position 1, then we get a ✓ for A. If A is actually at position 2 or 4, then we would get a '-' for A.

 However, note that in our feedback for the first guess: the A was placed at position 3 and was wrong. So if the secret word has A at position 1, then when we guess ""ALIVE"", A will be at position 1 and that might be the correct position? Or maybe it's at position 2 or 4.

 Another candidate: ""ABASE"" -> A, B, A, S, E -> contains two A's? But we don't know if there are two A's. Also, we have to consider that our first guess with A had only one A and the feedback for A was '-'. What if the secret word has two A's? Then we would have gotten one '-' for the A we placed at position 3 and the other A at a different position wouldn't have been revealed because we didn't guess it. However, it's safer to assume single letter unless evidence for duplication. 

 But note: ""ABASE"" has two A's and we don't know if there's duplication. Also, we haven't tested S? We have S in ""ABASE"".

 Actually, we haven't tested any of these letters (besides A and E) because our first guess was ""CRANE"". So we have no information on L, I, V, B, S, etc.

 Also, we know the secret word does not have C, R, N.

 Alternative: Since we know A is present and E is fixed at position 5, we can try a word that moves A to other positions to test.

 Consider: 
   Position 1: A? Then we can pick a word starting with A and ending with E: e.g., AWAKE? But W and K are new.

   Position 2: A? Then word: _A__E, e.g., ""MAZES"" but we don't know about Z (rare). Or ""LATHE"", ""GAVEL"", ""HASTE"", etc.

   Position 4: A? Then word: ___AE, e.g., ""PLANE"" but has N (not allowed) and L.

 However, considering we want to test as many new letters as possible, I think ""ALIVE"" is a good candidate because:
   - A is at position 1: if it's correct, we fix A. If it's not, then we get information that A must be at position 2 or 4 (since the secret word must have A).
   - It introduces new letters: L, I, V.

 Alternatively, we might choose ""HASTE"": 
   H, A, S, T, E -> positions: 
      Position 2: A (so testing A at position 2)
   And H, S, T are new.

 But note: in ""HASTE"", position 5 is E (which we know is fixed).

 However, we are missing information about the rest. We have only two knowns: A is somewhere else (not pos3) and E is fixed.

 Another good candidate: ""PLATE""? 
   P, L, A, T, E -> note: A is at position 3? But wait, we guessed A at position 3 before and it was wrong. Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 3 again? 
   However, we want to test A at different positions? Actually, we already know that the secret word's A is not at position 3, so repeating A at position 3 would be futile? 

 Wait, no: we must not put A at position 3 again because we already know it's not there. So in a new word, we can put A anywhere except position 3? 
 Actually, we can put A wherever we want to test? We might even test if there are multiple A's?

 So let's not assume duplicates unless we have to.

 Back to ""PLATE"": 
   P, L, A, T, E -> but here we are putting A at position 3. We already know A is not at position 3! So why test the same position? 
   So we should avoid position 3 for A.

 Therefore, we cannot use ""PLATE"" because it puts A at position 3 (the forbidden position). Similarly, ""SLATE"" would put A at position 3.

 How about ""PEACE""? 
   But note: 
      P, E, A, C, E -> 
        Position 2: E -> but we don't have feedback about E at position 2? And indeed we know E at position 5 is correct, but this word has E at position 2 as well? 
        Also, we cannot use C because we know C is not in the word.

 So avoid C.

 What about ""PASTE""? 
   P, A, S, T, E -> 
        Position 1: P
        Position 2: A  (so we are testing A at position 2)
        Position 3: S
        Position 4: T
        Position 5: E -> fixed.

 This word: 
   - avoids C, R, N (letters that are not in the word)
   - has A at position 2 (a new position for A)
   - introduces new letters: P, S, T.

 Similarly, ""HASTE"" would be similar: H, A, S, T, E.

 But note: we are limited by actual words. Both ""PASTE"" and ""HASTE"" are words.

 Another candidate: ""AGAPE""?
   A, G, A, P, E -> but two A's? It's a word. We would test A at position 1 and position 3? But we know A is not at position 3 (so that A at position 3 would be a miss) and then A at position 1 might be hit? But we don't want to introduce duplication unnecessarily?

Then word: ___AE, e.g., ""PLANE"" but has N (not allowed) and L.\n\n However, considering we want to test as many new letters as possible, I think ""ALIVE"" is a good candidate because:\n   - A is at position 1: if it\'s correct, we fix A. If it\'s not, then we get information that A must be at position 2 or 4 (since the secret word must have A).\n   - It introduces new letters: L, I, V.\n\n Alternatively, we might choose ""HASTE"": \n   H, A, S, T, E -> positions: \n      Position 2: A (so testing A at position 2)\n   And H, S, T are new.\n\n But note: in ""HASTE"", position 5 is E (which we know is fixed).\n\n However, we are missing information about the rest. We have only two knowns: A is somewhere else (not pos3) and E is fixed.\n\n Another good candidate: ""PLATE""? \n   P, L, A, T, E -> note: A is at position 3? But wait, we guessed A at position 3 before and it was wrong. Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 3 again? \n   However, we want to test A at different positions? Actually, we already know that the secret word\'s A is not at position 3, so repeating A at position 3 would be futile? \n\n Wait, no: we must not put A at position 3 again because we already know it\'s not there. So in a new word, we can put A anywhere except position 3? \n Actually, we can put A wherever we want to test? We might even test if there are multiple A\'s? \n\n But note: the feedback for our first guess: only one A was in the word? Actually, we don\'t know if there are multiple A\'s. But our guess had only one A and we got one \'-\' for A. If there were two A\'s, we would have gotten two \'-\' for two guesses? Only if we had guessed two A\'s? \n\n We only guessed one A in ""crane"", so even if there were two A\'s in the secret word, we would have only one \'-\' for A because we guessed one A. Therefore, we cannot conclude from that feedback that there is only one A. But we know that the secret word has at least one A.\n\n So let\'s not assume duplicates unless we have to.\n\n Back to ""PLATE"": \n   P, L, A, T, E -> but here we are putting A at position 3. We already know A is not at position 3! So why test the same position? \n   So we should avoid position 3 for A.\n\n Therefore, we cannot use ""PLATE"" because it puts A at position 3 (the forbidden position). Similarly, ""SLATE"" would put A at position 3.\n\n How about ""PEACE""? \n   But note: \n      P, E, A, C, E -> \n        Position 2: E -> but we don\'t have feedback about E at position 2? And indeed we know E at position 5 is correct, but this word has E at position 2 as well? \n        Also, we cannot use C because we know C is not in the word.\n\n So avoid C.\n\n What about ""PASTE""? \n   P, A, S, T, E -> \n        Position 1: P\n        Position 2: A  (so we are testing A at position 2)\n        Position 3: S\n        Position 4: T\n        Position 5: E -> fixed.\n\n This word: \n   - avoids C, R, N (letters that are not in the word)\n   - has A at position 2 (a new position for A)\n   - introduces new letters: P, S, T.\n\n Similarly, ""HASTE"" would be similar: H, A, S, T, E.\n\n But note: we are limited by actual words. Both ""PASTE"" and ""HASTE"" are words.\n\n Another candidate: ""AGAPE""?\n   A, G, A, P, E -> but two A\'s? It\'s a word. We would test A at position 1 and position 3? But we know A is not at position 3 (so that A at position 3 would be a miss) and then A at position 1 might be hit? But we don\'t want to introduce duplication unnecessarily? \n\n Alternatively, we could go for one of the more common letters: introduce S and T. Since they are common consonants.\n\n I think ""PASTE"" or ""HASTE"" are both acceptable.\n\n Let me compare:\n   Using ""PASTE"":\n        If the secret word has A at position 2, then we get A(✓) and if not then we get A(-) meaning A must be at position 4? because position 1 would also be a possibility? \n        Also, we test P, S, T.\n\n   Using ""ALIVE"":\n        A at position 1: if it\'s ✓, then we fix A at position 1. If it\'s -, then A must be at position 2 or 4? \n        Also, we test L, I, V.\n\n We don\'t have much to go on. Since E is fixed at the end, and we haven\'t tested many letters, both are reasonable.\n\n But note: we know the secret word has an A and an E at position 5. The other three letters we haven\'t encountered.\n\n Since we only have 5 more tries, we want to maximize information. \n\n The letter S is very common. So let me introduce S and T? \n\n I think I\'ll go with ""PASTE"".\n\n However, wait: what if the secret word has A at position 1? Then with ""PASTE"", we would put A at position 2 and get a \'-\' for A? Then we know A exists but not at position 2, and combined with the first guess, we know A cannot be at position 3. Then A must be at position 1 or 4? Then we still have ambiguity.\n\n But with ""ALIVE"" we are testing position 1 for A.\n\n Alternatively, we could choose a word that has A at one of the remaining possible positions (1,2,4) and test more common letters. \n\n But note: we also have the constraint that E is at position 5.\n\n After some thought, I\'ll go with ""PASTE"". Why?\n   - It tests three common consonants (P, S, T) and moves A to position 2.\n   - If we get a \'-\' on A again, then we know the A is at position 4? Because position 1 and 4 are left? Actually, we would only know that A is not at position 2. Then together with the first feedback (not at position 3), then A must be at position 1 or 4. Then in the next guess we can test position 4 by placing A at position 4? \n\n But also, if we get a ✓ for A at position 2, then we fix A and we are happy.\n\n So, we\'ll try ""PASTE"".\n\n<guess>paste</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, R, N**: Not in the secret word (`x`).\n- **A**: Present but not in position 3 (`-`), so it must be in position 1, 2, or 4.\n- **E**: Correct and in position 5 (`✓`).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must end with **E** (position 5).\n- It must include **A** in position 1, 2, or 4.\n- It cannot include **C, R, N**.\n- To maximize information, new common letters should be tested (e.g., **S, T, P**).\n\nA strong candidate is **PASTE**:\n- Ends with **E** (position 5).\n- Places **A** in position 2 (testing a new position).\n- Introduces **P, S, T** (common letters not yet tested).\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N).\n\n<guess>paste</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: paste -> FEEDBACK: P(-) A(-) S(x) T(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from the second guess ""paste"":
  P: - -> in the word but wrong position
  A: - -> in the word but wrong position (again)
  S: x -> not in the word
  T: x -> not in the word
  E: ✓ -> correct and in position 5 (as before)

 So, we know:
  - E is fixed at position 5.
  - A is in the word but not at position 3 (from first guess) and not at position 2 (from this guess). Therefore, A must be at position 1 or 4 (since position 5 is E, so A cannot be there).
  - P is in the word but not at position 1 (because we guessed P at position 1 and it was wrong position). So P is in the word and must be at one of positions 2,3,4? But note: position 5 is E, so P cannot be at 5. Therefore, P is at position 2,3, or 4? But wait, we have to consider the positions available: 1,2,3,4. We know position 1: we don't know, but we put P there and it was wrong, so P is not at 1. So P must be at 2,3, or 4.
  - S and T are not in the word.

 Also, from the first guess, we know C, R, N are not in the word.

 Now, the secret word has:
   - A (at position 1 or 4)
   - P (at position 2,3, or 4)
   - E (at position 5)

 And we know the word does not have: C, R, N, S, T.

 We have to form a 5-letter word that:
   - Ends with E (position 5)
   - Contains A and P (and E, which is fixed)
   - A is at position 1 or 4.
   - P is at position 2,3, or 4.

 Also, we must avoid C, R, N, S, T.

 Let's consider the possibilities for A:

 Case 1: A at position 1.
   Then the word is: A _ _ _ E

   And P must be at position 2,3, or 4. But note: we cannot have A and P at the same position? So if A is at 1, then P must be at 2,3, or 4.

   We need to fill the remaining two positions (if A is at 1 and P is at one of 2,3,4) with letters that are not C, R, N, S, T and are in the word.

 Case 2: A at position 4.
   Then the word is: _ _ _ A E

   And P must be at position 2,3, or 4. But note: if A is at 4, then P cannot be at 4? Because one letter per position? So if A is at 4, then P must be at 2 or 3.

 We also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

 We need to choose a word that tests these possibilities and also introduces new letters? But we have to be careful because we have only 4 tries left.

 Alternatively, we can try to solve by focusing on the known letters.

 Since we know two letters (A and P) are present and one fixed (E at 5), we can try to form a word that uses A and P and E, and two new letters that are common and not excluded.

 Excluded letters: C, R, N, S, T.

 Available letters: all others.

 We also know that A must be at 1 or 4, and P must be at 2,3,4 (but not at the same position as A if they conflict).

 Let's try to think of words that end with E and have A and P.

 Possibilities:

   If A is at 1: 
        A _ _ _ E
        We can try: A P _ _ E -> but then P is at position 2? Then the word would be like ""APPLE"" but we cannot use L? Wait, we don't know about L? And also, we have to avoid S, T? But ""APPLE"" has L and E (fixed). But we haven't tested L. Also, ""APPLE"" has two P's? 

        Actually, we don't know if there are duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any duplicates so far? 

        Alternatively: A _ P _ E -> P at position 3? e.g., ""AMPLY"" -> but not ending with E? 

        Words: 
          ""AMPLE"" -> A, M, P, L, E -> but we don't know about M and L? And we have to avoid S, T? M and L are not excluded. 
          ""APPLE"" -> A, P, P, L, E -> but two P's? We don't know if P is duplicated? 

        However, note: in our feedback for ""paste"", we had only one P and it was marked as present (but wrong position). If there were two P's, we would have gotten two marks? Only if we had guessed two P's? We only guessed one P, so we don't know.

        So we have to consider both possibilities.

   If A is at 4:
        _ _ _ A E
        We can try: _ _ P A E -> e.g., ""UPPAE""? Not a word. 
        Or: _ P _ A E -> e.g., ""SPEAE""? Not a word. 
        Or: _ _ _ A E -> with P at position 2 or 3? 

        Words: 
          ""OPALE"" -> O, P, A, L, E? But that would be O at 1, P at 2, A at 3? But wait, we are putting A at 4? Actually, ""OPALE"" is O,P,A,L,E -> positions: O(1), P(2), A(3), L(4), E(5) -> but we are requiring A at position 4? So that doesn't match.

        Actually, we need A at position 4: so the word must be: ? ? ? A E, and the third letter must be A? No, the fourth letter is A. So the word is: letter1, letter2, letter3, A, E.

        Example: ""UPDATED""? Too long. We need 5 letters.

        How about ""SPADE""? But S is excluded. 

        ""ADEEM""? But no P.

        It's hard to find words with A at position 4 and P in the word? 

        Another: ""PAGED""? But that has A at position 2? 

        Actually, we are considering A at position 4: so the word must end with ""AE"". 

        Words ending with ""AE"" are rare? 

        How about ""AGAPE""? But that has A at position 1 and 4? 
          A G A P E -> 
            Position 1: A
            Position 2: G
            Position 3: A -> but we know A is not at position 3? Because first guess had A at 3 and it was wrong. So we cannot have A at position 3. Therefore, ""AGAPE"" is invalid because it has A at position 3? 

        Actually, in ""AGAPE"": 
          A at position 1: we don't know if that's allowed? 
          A at position 3: but we know the secret word does not have A at position 3? So that would be invalid? 

        Therefore, we cannot have a word with A at position 3. So any word that has A at position 3 is invalid? 

        So for the case A at position 4, the word must be: _ _ _ A E, and the first three letters cannot be A? 

        Example: ""SHADE""? But S is excluded. 
        ""BLADE""? L and D are new? But we have to avoid S, T? 

        Actually, we can use: ""GLADE"" -> G, L, A, D, E? But that has A at position 3? No: 
          G(1), L(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> but we are requiring A at position 4? So that's not.

        We need the fourth letter to be A: so the word pattern is: ? ? ? A E.

        Examples: 
          ""PIZZA"" -> doesn't end with E? 
          ""PODIA""? -> not ending with E.

        Actually, I can't think of many common words ending with ""AE"". 

        How about ""FACADE""? Too long.

        Maybe ""JUDGE""? No A.

        This seems difficult. So perhaps A is more likely at position 1.

 Given the difficulty, let's assume A is at position 1. Then we have: A _ _ _ E.

 And P is in the word at position 2,3, or 4.

 We can try to form words with A at 1 and P at 2,3, or 4, and avoid C,R,N,S,T.

 Possibilities:

   A P _ _ E: e.g., ""APPLE"" (but we don't know about L and we have two P's? but we only need one P? Actually, we know P is present, but we don't know if there are two. But ""APPLE"" has two P's? 
        A, P, P, L, E -> so the second and third letters are both P? That's not standard. Actually, ""APPLE"" is A, P, P, L, E? No, ""APPLE"" is A, P, P, L, E? Wait, no: 
        ""APPLE"": A, P, P, L, E? Actually, it's A, P, P, L, E? But that's three positions: 
          Position 1: A
          Position 2: P
          Position 3: P
          Position 4: L
          Position 5: E

        But we have two P's? 

        Alternatively, ""APEX"" -> too short.

        ""APTLY"" -> no E.

        ""AMPLE"": A, M, P, L, E -> 
          Position 1: A
          Position 2: M
          Position 3: P
          Position 4: L
          Position 5: E

        This is a valid word. And it has P at position 3.

        Also, ""AMBLE"": A, M, B, L, E -> but no P.

        So ""AMPLE"" is a candidate.

   A _ P _ E: e.g., ""A P _ _ E"" -> ""APPLE"" doesn't fit because it has P at 2 and 3? 
        ""AISLE"" -> no P? 
        ""AZURE"" -> no P? 
        ""AWAKE"" -> no P? 
        ""AGAPE"" -> but we cannot have A at position 3? 
        ""ADOBE"" -> no P? 
        ""ABUSE"" -> but S is excluded? 

        Actually, ""AMPLE"" has P at position 3? So that fits the pattern A _ P _ E? 
          A, M, P, L, E -> 
            Position 1: A
            Position 2: M
            Position 3: P
            Position 4: L
            Position 5: E

        So that's the same as above.

   A _ _ P E: e.g., ""A _ _ P E"" -> ""AGAPE"" -> but A at position 3 is invalid? 
        ""AUDIO"" -> no E? 
        ""AUNTS"" -> S excluded? 
        ""AURAE"" -> but has A at position 1 and 4? and U, R (but R is excluded) and A at 4? 
        ""AURAE"": A, U, R, A, E -> but R is excluded? 

        Not many common words.

 So ""AMPLE"" seems a good candidate.

 But note: we also have the possibility that A is at position 4? But we are having trouble finding words with A at 4? 

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? 

 How about we try a word that has A at position 1 and P at position 4? 

 For example: ""A _ _ P E"" -> but we just saw it's hard. 

 Or, we can try to test the position of A and P simultaneously? 

 Since we have limited tries, we might try to guess a word that has A at position 1 and P at position 4? 

 Example: ""AWA PE"" -> not a word. 
          ""ALPINE"" -> too long? 
          ""AUDIO"" -> no E? 

 Actually, I can't find a common word with A at 1 and P at 4? 

 Therefore, let's go with ""AMPLE"". Why?

   - It has A at position 1 (so if A is actually at position 1, we get a ✓ for A? and if not, then we know A must be at position 4? because we've ruled out 2 and 3?).
   - It has P at position 3 (so if P is at position 3, we get a ✓ for P? and if not, then we get a '-' and know P is at 2 or 4? but note we are also testing the position of A).

   Also, we introduce two new letters: M and L.

   The word ""AMPLE"" is valid.

   But note: what if A is actually at position 4? Then in ""AMPLE"", we have A at position 1 and that would be a wrong letter? But we know A is in the word, so we would get a '-' for A? Then we would know that A is not at position 1? And then we would know A must be at position 4? 

   Similarly, for P: if P is at position 3, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know P is at position 2 or 4? 

   So this guess will help us narrow down the positions.

   Also, we avoid the excluded letters.

 So let's choose ""AMPLE"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are guessing one A and one P? 

 We'll see.

<guess>ample</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **E** is confirmed in position 5.
- **A** is present but not in position 2, 3, or 5 (must be in position 1 or 4).
- **P** is present but not in position 1 (must be in position 2, 3, or 4).
- **C, R, N, S, T** are absent.
- The word must include **A** and **P**, end with **E**, and avoid excluded letters.

After evaluating possibilities:
- **AMPLE** is a strategic guess because:
  - Places **A** in position 1 (testing the first possible location).
  - Places **P** in position 3 (testing a new position).
  - Introduces new common letters **M** and **L**.
  - Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, N, S, T).

This guess will clarify:
- If **A** is in position 1 (✓) or 4 (-).
- If **P** is in position 3 (✓) or elsewhere (-).
- Letters **M** and **L**'s presence/absence.

<guess>ample</guess>",ample,"We are given feedback from the second guess ""paste"":
  P: - -> in the word but wrong position
  A: - -> in the word but wrong position (again)
  S: x -> not in the word
  T: x -> not in the word
  E: ✓ -> correct and in position 5 (as before)

 So, we know:
  - E is fixed at position 5.
  - A is in the word but not at position 3 (from first guess) and not at position 2 (from this guess). Therefore, A must be at position 1 or 4 (since position 5 is E, so A cannot be there).
  - P is in the word but not at position 1 (because we guessed P at position 1 and it was wrong position). So P is in the word and must be at one of positions 2,3,4? But note: position 5 is E, so P cannot be at 5. Therefore, P is at position 2,3, or 4? But wait, we have to consider the positions available: 1,2,3,4. We know position 1: we don't know, but we put P there and it was wrong, so P is not at 1. So P must be at 2,3, or 4.
  - S and T are not in the word.

 Also, from the first guess, we know C, R, N are not in the word.

 Now, the secret word has:
   - A (at position 1 or 4)
   - P (at position 2,3, or 4)
   - E (at position 5)

 And we know the word does not have: C, R, N, S, T.

 We have to form a 5-letter word that:
   - Ends with E (position 5)
   - Contains A and P (and E, which is fixed)
   - A is at position 1 or 4.
   - P is at position 2,3, or 4.

 Also, we must avoid C, R, N, S, T.

 Let's consider the possibilities for A:

 Case 1: A at position 1.
   Then the word is: A _ _ _ E

   And P must be at position 2,3, or 4. But note: we cannot have A and P at the same position? So if A is at 1, then P must be at 2,3, or 4.

   We need to fill the remaining two positions (if A is at 1 and P is at one of 2,3,4) with letters that are not C, R, N, S, T and are in the word.

 Case 2: A at position 4.
   Then the word is: _ _ _ A E

   And P must be at position 2,3, or 4. But note: if A is at 4, then P cannot be at 4? Because one letter per position? So if A is at 4, then P must be at 2 or 3.

 We also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

 We need to choose a word that tests these possibilities and also introduces new letters? But we have to be careful because we have only 4 tries left.

 Alternatively, we can try to solve by focusing on the known letters.

 Since we know two letters (A and P) are present and one fixed (E at 5), we can try to form a word that uses A and P and E, and two new letters that are common and not excluded.

 Excluded letters: C, R, N, S, T.

 Available letters: all others.

 We also know that A must be at 1 or 4, and P must be at 2,3,4 (but not at the same position as A if they conflict).

 Let's try to think of words that end with E and have A and P.

 Possibilities:

   If A is at 1: 
        A _ _ _ E
        We can try: A P _ _ E -> but then P is at position 2? Then the word would be like ""APPLE"" but we cannot use L? Wait, we don't know about L? And also, we have to avoid S, T? But ""APPLE"" has L and E (fixed). But we haven't tested L. Also, ""APPLE"" has two P's? 

        Actually, we don't know if there are duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any duplicates so far? 

        Alternatively: A _ P _ E -> P at position 3? e.g., ""AMPLY"" -> but not ending with E? 

        Words: 
          ""AMPLE"" -> A, M, P, L, E -> but we don't know about M and L? And we have to avoid S, T? M and L are not excluded. 
          ""APPLE"" -> A, P, P, L, E -> but two P's? We don't know if P is duplicated? 

        However, note: in our feedback for ""paste"", we had only one P and it was marked as present (but wrong position). If there were two P's, we would have gotten two marks? Only if we had guessed two P's? We only guessed one P, so we don't know.

        So we have to consider both possibilities.

   If A is at 4:
        _ _ _ A E
        We can try: _ _ P A E -> e.g., ""UPPAE""? Not a word. 
        Or: _ P _ A E -> e.g., ""SPEAE""? Not a word. 
        Or: _ _ _ A E -> with P at position 2 or 3? 

        Words: 
          ""OPALE"" -> O, P, A, L, E? But that would be O at 1, P at 2, A at 3? But wait, we are putting A at 4? Actually, ""OPALE"" is O,P,A,L,E -> positions: O(1), P(2), A(3), L(4), E(5) -> but we are requiring A at position 4? So that doesn't match.

        Actually, we need A at position 4: so the word must be: ? ? ? A E, and the third letter must be A? No, the fourth letter is A. So the word is: letter1, letter2, letter3, A, E.

        Example: ""UPDATED""? Too long. We need 5 letters.

        How about ""SPADE""? But S is excluded. 

        ""ADEEM""? But no P.

        It's hard to find words with A at position 4 and P in the word? 

        Another: ""PAGED""? But that has A at position 2? 

        Actually, we are considering A at position 4: so the word must end with ""AE"". 

        Words ending with ""AE"" are rare? 

        How about ""AGAPE""? But that has A at position 1 and 4? 
          A G A P E -> 
            Position 1: A
            Position 2: G
            Position 3: A -> but we know A is not at position 3? Because first guess had A at 3 and it was wrong. So we cannot have A at position 3. Therefore, ""AGAPE"" is invalid because it has A at position 3? 

        Actually, in ""AGAPE"": 
          A at position 1: we don't know if that's allowed? 
          A at position 3: but we know the secret word does not have A at position 3? So that would be invalid? 

        Therefore, we cannot have a word with A at position 3. So any word that has A at position 3 is invalid? 

        So for the case A at position 4, the word must be: _ _ _ A E, and the first three letters cannot be A? 

        Example: ""SHADE""? But S is excluded. 
        ""BLADE""? L and D are new? But we have to avoid S, T? 

        Actually, we can use: ""GLADE"" -> G, L, A, D, E? But that has A at position 3? No: 
          G(1), L(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> but we are requiring A at position 4? So that's not.

        We need the fourth letter to be A: so the word pattern is: ? ? ? A E.

        Examples: 
          ""PIZZA"" -> doesn't end with E? 
          ""PODIA""? -> not ending with E.

        Actually, I can't think of many common words ending with ""AE"". 

        How about ""FACADE""? Too long.

        Maybe ""JUDGE""? No A.

        This seems difficult. So perhaps A is more likely at position 1.

 Given the difficulty, let's assume A is at position 1. Then we have: A _ _ _ E.

 And P is in the word at position 2,3, or 4.

 We can try to form words with A at 1 and P at 2,3, or 4, and avoid C,R,N,S,T.

 Possibilities:

   A P _ _ E: e.g., ""APPLE"" (but we don't know about L and we have two P's? but we only need one P? Actually, we know P is present, but we don't know if there are two. But ""APPLE"" has two P's? 
        A, P, P, L, E -> so the second and third letters are both P? That's not standard. Actually, ""APPLE"" is A, P, P, L, E? No, ""APPLE"" is A, P, P, L, E? Wait, no: 
        ""APPLE"": A, P, P, L, E? Actually, it's A, P, P, L, E? But that's three positions: 
          Position 1: A
          Position 2: P
          Position 3: P
          Position 4: L
          Position 5: E

        But we have two P's? 

        Alternatively, ""APEX"" -> too short.

        ""APTLY"" -> no E.

        ""AMPLE"": A, M, P, L, E -> 
          Position 1: A
          Position 2: M
          Position 3: P
          Position 4: L
          Position 5: E

        This is a valid word. And it has P at position 3.

        Also, ""AMBLE"": A, M, B, L, E -> but no P.

        So ""AMPLE"" is a candidate.

   A _ P _ E: e.g., ""A P _ _ E"" -> ""APPLE"" doesn't fit because it has P at 2 and 3? 
        ""AISLE"" -> no P? 
        ""AZURE"" -> no P? 
        ""AWAKE"" -> no P? 
        ""AGAPE"" -> but we cannot have A at position 3? 
        ""ADOBE"" -> no P? 
        ""ABUSE"" -> but S is excluded? 

        Actually, ""AMPLE"" has P at position 3? So that fits the pattern A _ P _ E? 
          A, M, P, L, E -> 
            Position 1: A
            Position 2: M
            Position 3: P
            Position 4: L
            Position 5: E

        So that's the same as above.

   A _ _ P E: e.g., ""A _ _ P E"" -> ""AGAPE"" -> but A at position 3 is invalid? 
        ""AUDIO"" -> no E? 
        ""AUNTS"" -> S excluded? 
        ""AURAE"" -> but has A at position 1 and 4? and U, R (but R is excluded) and A at 4? 
        ""AURAE"": A, U, R, A, E -> but R is excluded? 

        Not many common words.

 So ""AMPLE"" seems a good candidate.

 But note: we also have the possibility that A is at position 4? But we are having trouble finding words with A at 4? 

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? 

 How about we try a word that has A at position 1 and P at position 4? 

 For example: ""A _ _ P E"" -> but we just saw it's hard. 

 Or, we can try to test the position of A and P simultaneously? 

 Since we have limited tries, we might try to guess a word that has A at position 1 and P at position 4? 

 Example: ""AWA PE"" -> not a word. 
          ""ALPINE"" -> too long? 
          ""AUDIO"" -> no E? 

 Actually, I can't find a common word with A at 1 and P at 4? 

 Therefore, let's go with ""AMPLE"". Why?

   - It has A at position 1 (so if A is actually at position 1, we get a ✓ for A? and if not, then we know A must be at position 4? because we've ruled out 2 and 3?).
   - It has P at position 3 (so if P is at position 3, we get a ✓ for P? and if not, then we get a '-' and know P is at 2 or 4? but note we are also testing the position of A).

   Also, we introduce two new letters: M and L.

   The word ""AMPLE"" is valid.

   But note: what if A is actually at position 4? Then in ""AMPLE"", we have A at position 1 and that would be a wrong letter? But we know A is in the word, so we would get a '-' for A? Then we would know that A is not at position 1? And then we would know A must be at position 4? 

   Similarly, for P: if P is at position 3, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know P is at position 2 or 4? 

   So this guess will help us narrow down the positions.

   Also, we avoid the excluded letters.

 So let's choose ""AMPLE"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are guessing one A and one P? 

 We'll see.

<guess>ample</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **E** is confirmed in position 5.
- **A** is present but not in position 2, 3, or 5 (must be in position 1 or 4).
- **P** is present but not in position 1 (must be in position 2, 3, or 4).
- **C, R, N, S, T** are absent.
- The word must include **A** and **P**, end with **E**, and avoid excluded letters.

After evaluating possibilities:
- **AMPLE** is a strategic guess because:
  - Places **A** in position 1 (testing the first possible location).
  - Places **P** in position 3 (testing a new position).
  - Introduces new common letters **M** and **L**.
  - Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, N, S, T).

This guess will clarify:
- If **A** is in position 1 (✓) or 4 (-).
- If **P** is in position 3 (✓) or elsewhere (-).
- Letters **M** and **L**'s presence/absence.",Guess 3: ample -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) M(✓) P(✓) L(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
