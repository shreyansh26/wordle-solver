We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).
   - It doesn't repeat any letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter of the secret word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, from this we know:
  - The second letter is R.
  - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position (since we guessed it at the fifth and it's marked as wrong position).
  - The letters C, A, N are not in the word.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters and we have to avoid C, A, N.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, it must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 4.

 Now, we need to make a second guess that:
  - Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
  - Includes the letter E (because it's in the secret word) but not at the fifth position.
  - Has R as the second letter.
  - Avoids the letters C, A, N.

 Let's think of words that have R in the second position and include E.

 Some possibilities:
  - BREW: B R E W -> but we need 5 letters, so too short.
  - BRED: B R E D -> 4 letters, too short.

 We need 5-letter words. Let's try:

  - BRIDE: B R I D E -> but E is at the end, and we know E cannot be at the end (because in the first guess E was at the end and marked as wrong position). So if we put E at the end again, it might be the same. But note: the secret word might have two E's? However, we don't know. But the feedback only showed one E in the word (since only one E was in the guess and it was marked as present). So it's safer to avoid putting E at the end.

  - We can try to put E in the first, third, or fourth position.

 Let me think of words with R in the second position and E in the first? 
  - ERECT: E R E C T -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word) and also has two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's. However, we must avoid C. So not this.

  - How about E in the third position?
    - WORD: _ R E _ _
    Examples: 
      - FREED: F R E E D -> but has two E's and we don't know if that's allowed. Also, we have to avoid A, C, N. This avoids them. But note: we have E in the third and fourth positions. However, the secret word has at least one E, but we don't know about two. Also, in the first guess, we had only one E and it was marked as present, so it might have only one. But it could have more. We can try.

  - But we also have to consider that the secret word has R in the second position and E somewhere else.

  - Another idea: PREY? 4 letters. Not 5.

  - TREND: T R E N D -> but N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So avoid.

  - BRUTE: B R U T E -> E is at the end. We want to avoid E at the end? But note: the feedback said E is in the word but not at the fifth position. So if we put E at the end, it will be wrong again. So we should avoid that.

  - How about E in the fourth position?
    - _ R _ E _
    Examples: 
      - GRUEL: G R U E L -> This has E in the fourth position. And avoids C, A, N. Also, G, U, L are new letters.

  - Another: PROBE: P R O B E -> but E at the end, so avoid.

  - BRINE: B R I N E -> but N is not allowed.

  - How about BRISK? But we don't know the word yet. And we have to avoid A, C, N. But we don't know if S and K are in the word.

  - Another word: GROVE: G R O V E -> E at the end, avoid.

  - Let me try to put E in the first position: 
    - E R _ _ _
    Examples: 
      - ERUPT: E R U P T -> avoids C, A, N. And E is at the first position. This is a valid word.

  - Also: ERECT is invalid because of C.

  - Another: ERODE: E R O D E -> has two E's? But we don't know. And O and D are new.

  - We can also try E in the third position: 
    - _ R E _ _
    Examples: 
      - TRESS: T R E S S -> but T was in the first guess? In the first guess, we had C (x), R (✓), A (x), N (x), E (-). So T is new? Actually, we haven't tried T. But note: the first guess didn't have T. So T might be in the word or not. Also, we have two S's? 

  - Another: FREAK: F R E A K -> but A is not allowed.

  - BREAK: B R E A K -> A not allowed.

  - DREGS: D R E G S -> avoids A, C, N. And E is in the third position.

  - Or: DRESS: D R E S S -> same as above.

  - But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Considering the above, I think ""ERUPT"" and ""DREGS"" are good candidates.

 However, we also know that the secret word does not have A, C, N. So we can use other letters.

 Let me choose ""ERUPT"" because:
   - It has E in the first position (which we haven't tested) and R in the second (which we know is correct).
   - It introduces three new letters: U, P, T.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has E in the fourth position? But we haven't tried that.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not at the fifth. So it could be in the first, third, or fourth. We are testing the first position with ""ERUPT"".

 So, let's go with ""ERUPT"".

- Must include **R** as the second letter.
- Must include **E** (since it's in the secret word), but **not in the fifth position**.
- Must avoid **C, A, N**.
- Should test new letters to gather more information.

The word **ERUPT** fits these criteria:

For the second guess:
- Must include **R** as the second letter.
- Must include **E** (since it's in the secret word), but **not in the fifth position**.
- Must avoid **C, A, N**.
- Should test new letters to gather more information.

The word **ERUPT** fits these criteria:
- **E** is in the first position (testing a new spot for E).
- **R** is in the second position (confirmed correct).
- Introduces new letters: **U, P, T** (to check for presence/absence).

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""erupt""
  E: - (in the word, but not in position 1) -> so E is present but not at position 1 or 5.
  R: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
  U: x (not in the word)
  P: x (not in the word)
  T: x (not in the word)

What we know so far:
- The secret word has 5 letters.
- The second letter is R (from both guesses).
- The letter E is in the word, but not in position 1, 2 (because R is there), or 5. So it must be in position 3 or 4.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, U, P, T.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Has R as the second letter.
- Includes the letter E in either position 3 or 4 (to find out exactly where it is).
- Avoids the letters C, A, N, U, P, T.

Since E must be in position 3 or 4, we can try to cover both possibilities by choosing a word that has E in one of these positions and also tests other common letters.

Let's consider the positions:
  Position 1: unknown, but cannot be E (from guess 2) and cannot be any of the excluded letters.
  Position 2: R (fixed)
  Position 3: could be E or another letter? But we know E is in the word and not in 1,2,5, so 3 or 4.
  Position 4: same as above.
  Position 5: unknown, but cannot be E (from guess 1).

We can try to guess a word that has E in position 3 and then if that doesn't work, we know it must be in position 4. Alternatively, we can try to test more new letters.

We also know that the word must have E and R, and we have only two positions left for E: 3 or 4.

Let's think of words that have R in the second position and E in the third or fourth.

First, E in the third position: _ R E _ _
  We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with letters that are not in the excluded list (C, A, N, U, P, T) and are common.

Possible letters: we can use B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Examples:
  - BREED: B R E E D -> but E is repeated? We don't know if the word has two E's. Also, D is new.
  - However, we have to avoid the excluded letters. BREED: B, D are new and allowed.

But note: we don't know if the word has two E's. The feedback from the first guess only showed one E, but it could have more. Similarly, the second guess had only one E and it was marked present.

Alternatively, we can try a word with E in the fourth position: _ R _ E _

Examples:
  - GRUEL: but U is excluded (from guess 2: U is not in the word).
  - FREED: F R E E D -> again, two E's? And we have F and D.

But we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since we have only two possible positions for E, we can choose a word that puts E in the third position and then if it's not there, we know it must be in the fourth. But we also want to test other letters.

Let me try to list some words:

For E in the third position:
  - BREW? -> 4 letters, too short.
  - BRED? -> 4 letters.
  - 5-letter words: 
      - BREAD -> but A is excluded.
      - DREAD -> A excluded.
      - FREED -> F R E E D (has two E's, but we don't mind testing)
      - GREET -> G R E E T -> but T is excluded (from guess 2: T is not in the word).
      - CREEP -> C excluded.
      - PREEN -> P excluded.

So with E in the third, we have limited options because many common words have excluded letters.

What about: 
  - BREME? Not a common word.
  - BRERE? Not a word.

How about: 
  - BRIDE -> but I and D. However, we haven't excluded I and D. But note: in the first guess, we had E at the end and it was present but not at the end, so the word has an E. But in BRIDE, E is at the end. We cannot put E at the end because we know it's not at the end. So we must avoid E at the end.

Therefore, for E in the third position, the fifth letter must not be E. Similarly, for E in the fourth position, the fifth letter must not be E.

So for E in the third: _ R E _ X (where X is not E and not excluded)

Examples:
  - BREWS? 5 letters? BREWS is 5 letters: B R E W S -> but W and S are new. And E in third.

But is BREWS a word? Yes, meaning of a type of beer? But let's check: it's a valid word.

  - Alternatively, BRENS? But N is excluded.

  - DRESS: D R E S S -> but we have two S's? And E in third. But S is new. However, we have to avoid T, but T is excluded so we are safe.

  - But note: in the first guess, we had E at the fifth and it was present but not there, so the secret word has an E. In DRESS, we have E at the third and S at the fourth and fifth. We don't know if the secret word has S.

  - Another: FRESH -> F R E S H -> H is new. And avoids excluded letters.

  - Or: WRECK -> but C and K? C is excluded, so no.

  - BLESS -> B L E S S -> but L is in position 2? We need R in position 2. So no.

  - So we need R in position 2.

Now, for E in the fourth position: _ R _ E _
  Examples:
    - GRACE -> but C and A excluded.
    - PRICE -> P and C excluded.
    - TRIPE -> T and P excluded.
    - DRIVE -> D R I V E -> but E at the end? We cannot have E at the end. So we must avoid that.

  - So the fifth letter must not be E. Therefore, we need a word like: _ R _ E X (where X is not E and not excluded)

  - Examples: 
      - GRUEL -> but U excluded.
      - GROVE -> but we have E at the end? No, GROVE has E at the end? G R O V E -> E at the fifth, which is not allowed. So avoid.

  - How about: BRUTE -> but U and T excluded.

  - CRONE -> C excluded.

  - DRONE -> D R O N E -> but N excluded and E at the end.

  - So we need a word that has a non-E at the end and E in the fourth.

  - Examples: 
      - BRIDE -> but E at the end, so no.
      - BRINE -> N excluded and E at the end.

  - How about: TRADE -> T and A excluded.

  - SHIRE -> S H I R E -> but R is in position 4? We need R in position 2. So no.

  - We need R in position 2: so the pattern is: _ R ? E ?

  - Let me think: ORATE? O R A T E -> but A and T excluded, and E at the end.

  - Another: WRITE -> W R I T E -> T excluded and E at the end.

  - So it's hard to find a word with E in the fourth and not at the end without excluded letters.

Given the difficulty, let's try to focus on E in the third position.

We have:
  Position: 1: ?, 2: R, 3: E, 4: ?, 5: ? (and ? cannot be E and not excluded)

We have to choose letters for positions 1,4,5 from: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test common letters to maximize information.

Possible words:
  - BREED: B R E E D -> but has two E's. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. Also, we are testing E in the third, but if the secret word has only one E and we put two, we might get confusing feedback. However, it's acceptable because if the secret word has only one E, then one of the E's in BREED will be marked as absent? But wait, the feedback marks each letter individually. Actually, if the secret word has only one E, then the first E (in position 3) would be marked as present (if it is the correct one) and the second E (in position 4) would be marked as absent? But that might not be efficient.

  - Instead, let's avoid multiple E's for now.

  - How about: BRICK -> but C excluded.

  - BRISK: B R I S K -> no E? But we must include E because we know E is in the word. So we cannot skip E.

  - We must include E in the third position.

  - So: _ R E _ _

  Words without repeating E and without excluded letters:

    - BREWS: B R E W S -> valid word. Letters: B, W, S are new.
    - DRESS: D R E S S -> has two S's, but that's okay. Letters: D, S.
    - FRESH: F R E S H -> letters: F, S, H.
    - GRESS? Not a word.
    - PRESS: P excluded.
    - TRESS: T excluded.
    - BREDE? Not common.
    - BRERE? Not a word.
    - BREME? Not common.

  - Another: DREGS: D R E G S -> avoids excluded letters. And G and S are new.

  - Or: GREWS? Not a word.

  - So we have: BREWS, DRESS, FRESH, DREGS.

  - Let's choose one that tests more common consonants.

  - I think ""FRESH"" is a good candidate: it has F, S, H which are common.

  - But note: we are putting E in the third position. If the secret word has E in the fourth, then this guess will show that E is not in the third, so we will know it must be in the fourth.

  - Alternatively, we could choose a word that has E in the fourth position to test that.

But since we are having trouble finding a word with E in the fourth without excluded letters, let's go with E in the third.

I choose ""FRESH"": F R E S H.

But wait, let me confirm: 
  F (position 1): new
  R (position 2): correct
  E (position 3): we are testing if E is here
  S (position 4): new
  H (position 5): new

This tests three new letters and checks the position of E.

If the feedback shows that E is not in the third position (i.e., marked as absent or wrong position) then we know E must be in the fourth position.

So, let's go with ""FRESH"".

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""FRESH"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Therefore, the third guess is ""FRESH"".

<guess>fresh</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **R** is confirmed in the second position.
- **E** is present but **not in positions 1, 2, or 5**, so it must be in position 3 or 4.
- Letters **C, A, N, U, P, T** are absent from the secret word.

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** in the second position.
- Must include **E** (tested in position 3 to narrow down its location).
- Avoids excluded letters (**C, A, N, U, P, T**).
- Tests new common letters (e.g., **F, S, H**).

**FRESH** fits these criteria:
- **F** (new) in position 1.
- **R** (✓) in position 2.
- **E** (tested in position 3).
- **S** (new) in position 4.
- **H** (new) in position 5.

This guess will help identify if **E** is in position 3 and provide information about other letters.

<guess>fresh</guess>",fresh,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""erupt""

  R: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
  U: x (not in the word)
  P: x (not in the word)
  T: x (not in the word)

What we know so far:
- The secret word has 5 letters.
- The second letter is R (from both guesses).
- The letter E is in the word, but not in position 1, 2 (because R is there), or 5. So it must be in position 3 or 4.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, U, P, T.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Has R as the second letter.
- Includes the letter E in either position 3 or 4 (to find out exactly where it is).
- Avoids the letters C, A, N, U, P, T.

Since E must be in position 3 or 4, we can try to cover both possibilities by choosing a word that has E in one of these positions and also tests other common letters.

Let's consider the positions:
  Position 1: unknown, but cannot be E (from guess 2) and cannot be any of the excluded letters.
  Position 2: R (fixed)
  Position 3: could be E or another letter? But we know E is in the word and not in 1,2,5, so 3 or 4.
  Position 4: same as above.
  Position 5: unknown, but cannot be E (from guess 1).

We can try to guess a word that has E in position 3 and then if that doesn't work, we know it must be in position 4. Alternatively, we can try to test more new letters.

We also know that the word must have E and R, and we have only two positions left for E: 3 or 4.

Let's think of words that have R in the second position and E in the third or fourth.

First, E in the third position: _ R E _ _
  We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with letters that are not in the excluded list (C, A, N, U, P, T) and are common.

Possible letters: we can use B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Examples:
  - BREED: B R E E D -> but E is repeated? We don't know if the word has two E's. Also, D is new.
  - However, we have to avoid the excluded letters. BREED: B, D are new and allowed.

But note: we don't know if the word has two E's. The feedback from the first guess only showed one E, but it could have more. Similarly, the second guess had only one E and it was marked present.

Alternatively, we can try a word with E in the fourth position: _ R _ E _

Examples:
  - GRUEL: but U is excluded (from guess 2: U is not in the word).
  - FREED: F R E E D -> again, two E's? And we have F and D.

But we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since we have only two possible positions for E, we can choose a word that puts E in the third position and then if it's not there, we know it must be in the fourth. But we also want to test other letters.

Let me try to list some words:

For E in the third position:
  - BREW? -> 4 letters, too short.
  - BRED? -> 4 letters.
  - 5-letter words: 
      - BREAD -> but A is excluded.
      - DREAD -> A excluded.
      - FREED -> F R E E D (has two E's, but we don't mind testing)
      - GREET -> G R E E T -> but T is excluded (from guess 2: T is not in the word).
      - CREEP -> C excluded.
      - PREEN -> P excluded.

So with E in the third, we have limited options because many common words have excluded letters.

What about: 
  - BREME? Not a common word.
  - BRERE? Not a word.

How about: 
  - BRIDE -> but I and D. However, we haven't excluded I and D. But note: in the first guess, we had E at the end and it was present but not at the end, so the word has an E. But in BRIDE, E is at the end. We cannot put E at the end because we know it's not at the end. So we must avoid E at the end.

Therefore, for E in the third position, the fifth letter must not be E. Similarly, for E in the fourth position, the fifth letter must not be E.

So for E in the third: _ R E _ X (where X is not E and not excluded)

Examples:
  - BREWS? 5 letters? BREWS is 5 letters: B R E W S -> but W and S are new. And E in third.

But is BREWS a word? Yes, meaning of a type of beer? But let's check: it's a valid word.

  - Alternatively, BRENS? But N is excluded.

  - DRESS: D R E S S -> but we have two S's? And E in third. But S is new. However, we have to avoid T, but T is excluded so we are safe.

  - But note: in the first guess, we had E at the fifth and it was present but not there, so the secret word has an E. In DRESS, we have E at the third and S at the fourth and fifth. We don't know if the secret word has S.

  - Another: FRESH -> F R E S H -> H is new. And avoids excluded letters.

  - Or: WRECK -> but C and K? C is excluded, so no.

  - BLESS -> B L E S S -> but L is in position 2? We need R in position 2. So no.

  - So we need R in position 2.

Now, for E in the fourth position: _ R _ E _
  Examples:
    - GRACE -> but C and A excluded.
    - PRICE -> P and C excluded.
    - TRIPE -> T and P excluded.
    - DRIVE -> D R I V E -> but E at the end? We cannot have E at the end. So we must avoid that.

  - So the fifth letter must not be E. Therefore, we need a word like: _ R _ E X (where X is not E and not excluded)

  - Examples: 
      - GRUEL -> but U excluded.
      - GROVE -> but we have E at the end? No, GROVE has E at the end? G R O V E -> E at the fifth, which is not allowed. So avoid.

  - How about: BRUTE -> but U and T excluded.

  - CRONE -> C excluded.

  - DRONE -> D R O N E -> but N excluded and E at the end.

      - BRINE -> N excluded and E at the end.

  - How about: TRADE -> T and A excluded.

  - SHIRE -> S H I R E -> but R is in position 4? We need R in position 2. So no.

  - We need R in position 2: so the pattern is: _ R ? E ?

  - Let me think: ORATE? O R A T E -> but A and T excluded, and E at the end.

  - Another: WRITE -> W R I T E -> T excluded and E at the end.

  - So it's hard to find a word with E in the fourth and not at the end without excluded letters.

Given the difficulty, let's try to focus on E in the third position.

We have:
  Position: 1: ?, 2: R, 3: E, 4: ?, 5: ? (and ? cannot be E and not excluded)

We have to choose letters for positions 1,4,5 from: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test common letters to maximize information.

Possible words:
  - BREED: B R E E D -> but has two E's. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. Also, we are testing E in the third, but if the secret word has only one E and we put two, we might get confusing feedback. However, it's acceptable because if the secret word has only one E, then one of the E's in BREED will be marked as absent? But wait, the feedback marks each letter individually. Actually, if the secret word has only one E, then the first E (in position 3) would be marked as present (if it is the correct one) and the second E (in position 4) would be marked as absent? But that might not be efficient.

  - Instead, let's avoid multiple E's for now.

  - How about: BRICK -> but C excluded.

  - BRISK: B R I S K -> no E? But we must include E because we know E is in the word. So we cannot skip E.

  - We must include E in the third position.

  - So: _ R E _ _

  Words without repeating E and without excluded letters:

    - BREWS: B R E W S -> valid word. Letters: B, W, S are new.
    - DRESS: D R E S S -> has two S's, but that's okay. Letters: D, S.
    - FRESH: F R E S H -> letters: F, S, H.
    - GRESS? Not a word.
    - PRESS: P excluded.
    - TRESS: T excluded.
    - BREDE? Not common.
    - BRERE? Not a word.
    - BREME? Not common.

  - Another: DREGS: D R E G S -> avoids excluded letters. And G and S are new.

  - Or: GREWS? Not a word.

  - So we have: BREWS, DRESS, FRESH, DREGS.

  - Let's choose one that tests more common consonants.

  - I think ""FRESH"" is a good candidate: it has F, S, H which are common.

  - But note: we are putting E in the third position. If the secret word has E in the fourth, then this guess will show that E is not in the third, so we will know it must be in the fourth.

  - Alternatively, we could choose a word that has E in the fourth position to test that.

But since we are having trouble finding a word with E in the fourth without excluded letters, let's go with E in the third.

I choose ""FRESH"": F R E S H.

But wait, let me confirm: 
  F (position 1): new
  R (position 2): correct
  E (position 3): we are testing if E is here
  S (position 4): new
  H (position 5): new

This tests three new letters and checks the position of E.

If the feedback shows that E is not in the third position (i.e., marked as absent or wrong position) then we know E must be in the fourth position.

So, let's go with ""FRESH"".

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""FRESH"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Therefore, the third guess is ""FRESH"".

<guess>fresh</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **R** is confirmed in the second position.
- **E** is present but **not in positions 1, 2, or 5**, so it must be in position 3 or 4.
- Letters **C, A, N, U, P, T** are absent from the secret word.

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** in the second position.
- Must include **E** (tested in position 3 to narrow down its location).
- Avoids excluded letters (**C, A, N, U, P, T**).
- Tests new common letters (e.g., **F, S, H**).

**FRESH** fits these criteria:
- **F** (new) in position 1.
- **R** (✓) in position 2.
- **E** (tested in position 3).
- **S** (new) in position 4.
- **H** (new) in position 5.

This guess will help identify if **E** is in position 3 and provide information about other letters.",Guess 3: fresh -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) E(-) S(x) H(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,DRIED,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).
   - It doesn't repeat any letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter of the secret word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, from this we know:
  - The second letter is R.
  - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position (since we guessed it at the fifth and it's marked as wrong position).
  - The letters C, A, N are not in the word.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters and we have to avoid C, A, N.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, it must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 4.

 Now, we need to make a second guess that:
  - Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
  - Includes the letter E (because it's in the secret word) but not at the fifth position.
  - Has R as the second letter.
  - Avoids the letters C, A, N.

 Let's think of words that have R in the second position and include E.

 Some possibilities:
  - BREW: B R E W -> but we need 5 letters, so too short.
  - BRED: B R E D -> 4 letters, too short.

 We need 5-letter words. Let's try:

  - BRIDE: B R I D E -> but E is at the end, and we know E cannot be at the end (because in the first guess E was at the end and marked as wrong position). So if we put E at the end again, it might be the same. But note: the secret word might have two E's? However, we don't know. But the feedback only showed one E in the word (since only one E was in the guess and it was marked as present). So it's safer to avoid putting E at the end.

  - We can try to put E in the first, third, or fourth position.

 Let me think of words with R in the second position and E in the first? 
  - ERECT: E R E C T -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word) and also has two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's. However, we must avoid C. So not this.

  - How about E in the third position?
    - WORD: _ R E _ _
    Examples: 
      - FREED: F R E E D -> but has two E's and we don't know if that's allowed. Also, we have to avoid A, C, N. This avoids them. But note: we have E in the third and fourth positions. However, the secret word has at least one E, but we don't know about two. Also, in the first guess, we had only one E and it was marked as present, so it might have only one. But it could have more. We can try.

  - But we also have to consider that the secret word has R in the second position and E somewhere else.

  - Another idea: PREY? 4 letters. Not 5.

  - TREND: T R E N D -> but N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So avoid.

  - BRUTE: B R U T E -> E is at the end. We want to avoid E at the end? But note: the feedback said E is in the word but not at the fifth position. So if we put E at the end, it will be wrong again. So we should avoid that.

  - How about E in the fourth position?
    - _ R _ E _
    Examples: 
      - GRUEL: G R U E L -> This has E in the fourth position. And avoids C, A, N. Also, G, U, L are new letters.

  - Another: PROBE: P R O B E -> but E at the end, so avoid.

  - BRINE: B R I N E -> but N is not allowed.

  - How about BRISK? But we don't know the word yet. And we have to avoid A, C, N. But we don't know if S and K are in the word.

  - Another word: GROVE: G R O V E -> E at the end, avoid.

  - Let me try to put E in the first position: 
    - E R _ _ _
    Examples: 
      - ERUPT: E R U P T -> avoids C, A, N. And E is at the first position. This is a valid word.

  - Also: ERECT is invalid because of C.

  - Another: ERODE: E R O D E -> has two E's? But we don't know. And O and D are new.

  - We can also try E in the third position: 
    - _ R E _ _
    Examples: 
      - TRESS: T R E S S -> but T was in the first guess? In the first guess, we had C (x), R (✓), A (x), N (x), E (-). So T is new? Actually, we haven't tried T. But note: the first guess didn't have T. So T might be in the word or not. Also, we have two S's? 

  - Another: FREAK: F R E A K -> but A is not allowed.

  - BREAK: B R E A K -> A not allowed.

  - DREGS: D R E G S -> avoids A, C, N. And E is in the third position.

  - Or: DRESS: D R E S S -> same as above.

  - But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Considering the above, I think ""ERUPT"" and ""DREGS"" are good candidates.

 However, we also know that the secret word does not have A, C, N. So we can use other letters.

 Let me choose ""ERUPT"" because:
   - It has E in the first position (which we haven't tested) and R in the second (which we know is correct).
   - It introduces three new letters: U, P, T.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has E in the fourth position? But we haven't tried that.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not at the fifth. So it could be in the first, third, or fourth. We are testing the first position with ""ERUPT"".

 So, let's go with ""ERUPT"".

<guess>erupt</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, A, N** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **R** is correct and in the second position (marked ""✓"").
- **E** is present but not in the fifth position (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- Must include **R** as the second letter.
- Must include **E** (since it's in the secret word), but **not in the fifth position**.
- Must avoid **C, A, N**.
- Should test new letters to gather more information.

The word **ERUPT** fits these criteria:
- **E** is in the first position (testing a new spot for E).
- **R** is in the second position (confirmed correct).
- Introduces new letters: **U, P, T** (to check for presence/absence).

<guess>erupt</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: erupt -> FEEDBACK: E(-) R(✓) U(x) P(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""erupt""
  E: - (in the word, but not in position 1) -> so E is present but not at position 1 or 5.
  R: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
  U: x (not in the word)
  P: x (not in the word)
  T: x (not in the word)

What we know so far:
- The secret word has 5 letters.
- The second letter is R (from both guesses).
- The letter E is in the word, but not in position 1, 2 (because R is there), or 5. So it must be in position 3 or 4.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, U, P, T.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Has R as the second letter.
- Includes the letter E in either position 3 or 4 (to find out exactly where it is).
- Avoids the letters C, A, N, U, P, T.

Since E must be in position 3 or 4, we can try to cover both possibilities by choosing a word that has E in one of these positions and also tests other common letters.

Let's consider the positions:
  Position 1: unknown, but cannot be E (from guess 2) and cannot be any of the excluded letters.
  Position 2: R (fixed)
  Position 3: could be E or another letter? But we know E is in the word and not in 1,2,5, so 3 or 4.
  Position 4: same as above.
  Position 5: unknown, but cannot be E (from guess 1).

We can try to guess a word that has E in position 3 and then if that doesn't work, we know it must be in position 4. Alternatively, we can try to test more new letters.

We also know that the word must have E and R, and we have only two positions left for E: 3 or 4.

Let's think of words that have R in the second position and E in the third or fourth.

First, E in the third position: _ R E _ _
  We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with letters that are not in the excluded list (C, A, N, U, P, T) and are common.

Possible letters: we can use B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Examples:
  - BREED: B R E E D -> but E is repeated? We don't know if the word has two E's. Also, D is new.
  - However, we have to avoid the excluded letters. BREED: B, D are new and allowed.

But note: we don't know if the word has two E's. The feedback from the first guess only showed one E, but it could have more. Similarly, the second guess had only one E and it was marked present.

Alternatively, we can try a word with E in the fourth position: _ R _ E _

Examples:
  - GRUEL: but U is excluded (from guess 2: U is not in the word).
  - FREED: F R E E D -> again, two E's? And we have F and D.

But we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since we have only two possible positions for E, we can choose a word that puts E in the third position and then if it's not there, we know it must be in the fourth. But we also want to test other letters.

Let me try to list some words:

For E in the third position:
  - BREW? -> 4 letters, too short.
  - BRED? -> 4 letters.
  - 5-letter words: 
      - BREAD -> but A is excluded.
      - DREAD -> A excluded.
      - FREED -> F R E E D (has two E's, but we don't mind testing)
      - GREET -> G R E E T -> but T is excluded (from guess 2: T is not in the word).
      - CREEP -> C excluded.
      - PREEN -> P excluded.

So with E in the third, we have limited options because many common words have excluded letters.

What about: 
  - BREME? Not a common word.
  - BRERE? Not a word.

How about: 
  - BRIDE -> but I and D. However, we haven't excluded I and D. But note: in the first guess, we had E at the end and it was present but not at the end, so the word has an E. But in BRIDE, E is at the end. We cannot put E at the end because we know it's not at the end. So we must avoid E at the end.

Therefore, for E in the third position, the fifth letter must not be E. Similarly, for E in the fourth position, the fifth letter must not be E.

So for E in the third: _ R E _ X (where X is not E and not excluded)

Examples:
  - BREWS? 5 letters? BREWS is 5 letters: B R E W S -> but W and S are new. And E in third.

But is BREWS a word? Yes, meaning of a type of beer? But let's check: it's a valid word.

  - Alternatively, BRENS? But N is excluded.

  - DRESS: D R E S S -> but we have two S's? And E in third. But S is new. However, we have to avoid T, but T is excluded so we are safe.

  - But note: in the first guess, we had E at the fifth and it was present but not there, so the secret word has an E. In DRESS, we have E at the third and S at the fourth and fifth. We don't know if the secret word has S.

  - Another: FRESH -> F R E S H -> H is new. And avoids excluded letters.

  - Or: WRECK -> but C and K? C is excluded, so no.

  - BLESS -> B L E S S -> but L is in position 2? We need R in position 2. So no.

  - So we need R in position 2.

Now, for E in the fourth position: _ R _ E _
  Examples:
    - GRACE -> but C and A excluded.
    - PRICE -> P and C excluded.
    - TRIPE -> T and P excluded.
    - DRIVE -> D R I V E -> but E at the end? We cannot have E at the end. So we must avoid that.

  - So the fifth letter must not be E. Therefore, we need a word like: _ R _ E X (where X is not E and not excluded)

  - Examples: 
      - GRUEL -> but U excluded.
      - GROVE -> but we have E at the end? No, GROVE has E at the end? G R O V E -> E at the fifth, which is not allowed. So avoid.

  - How about: BRUTE -> but U and T excluded.

  - CRONE -> C excluded.

  - DRONE -> D R O N E -> but N excluded and E at the end.

  - So we need a word that has a non-E at the end and E in the fourth.

  - Examples: 
      - BRIDE -> but E at the end, so no.
      - BRINE -> N excluded and E at the end.

  - How about: TRADE -> T and A excluded.

  - SHIRE -> S H I R E -> but R is in position 4? We need R in position 2. So no.

  - We need R in position 2: so the pattern is: _ R ? E ?

  - Let me think: ORATE? O R A T E -> but A and T excluded, and E at the end.

  - Another: WRITE -> W R I T E -> T excluded and E at the end.

  - So it's hard to find a word with E in the fourth and not at the end without excluded letters.

Given the difficulty, let's try to focus on E in the third position.

We have:
  Position: 1: ?, 2: R, 3: E, 4: ?, 5: ? (and ? cannot be E and not excluded)

We have to choose letters for positions 1,4,5 from: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test common letters to maximize information.

Possible words:
  - BREED: B R E E D -> but has two E's. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. Also, we are testing E in the third, but if the secret word has only one E and we put two, we might get confusing feedback. However, it's acceptable because if the secret word has only one E, then one of the E's in BREED will be marked as absent? But wait, the feedback marks each letter individually. Actually, if the secret word has only one E, then the first E (in position 3) would be marked as present (if it is the correct one) and the second E (in position 4) would be marked as absent? But that might not be efficient.

  - Instead, let's avoid multiple E's for now.

  - How about: BRICK -> but C excluded.

  - BRISK: B R I S K -> no E? But we must include E because we know E is in the word. So we cannot skip E.

  - We must include E in the third position.

  - So: _ R E _ _

  Words without repeating E and without excluded letters:

    - BREWS: B R E W S -> valid word. Letters: B, W, S are new.
    - DRESS: D R E S S -> has two S's, but that's okay. Letters: D, S.
    - FRESH: F R E S H -> letters: F, S, H.
    - GRESS? Not a word.
    - PRESS: P excluded.
    - TRESS: T excluded.
    - BREDE? Not common.
    - BRERE? Not a word.
    - BREME? Not common.

  - Another: DREGS: D R E G S -> avoids excluded letters. And G and S are new.

  - Or: GREWS? Not a word.

  - So we have: BREWS, DRESS, FRESH, DREGS.

  - Let's choose one that tests more common consonants.

  - I think ""FRESH"" is a good candidate: it has F, S, H which are common.

  - But note: we are putting E in the third position. If the secret word has E in the fourth, then this guess will show that E is not in the third, so we will know it must be in the fourth.

  - Alternatively, we could choose a word that has E in the fourth position to test that.

But since we are having trouble finding a word with E in the fourth without excluded letters, let's go with E in the third.

I choose ""FRESH"": F R E S H.

But wait, let me confirm: 
  F (position 1): new
  R (position 2): correct
  E (position 3): we are testing if E is here
  S (position 4): new
  H (position 5): new

This tests three new letters and checks the position of E.

If the feedback shows that E is not in the third position (i.e., marked as absent or wrong position) then we know E must be in the fourth position.

So, let's go with ""FRESH"".

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""FRESH"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Therefore, the third guess is ""FRESH"".

<guess>fresh</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **R** is confirmed in the second position.
- **E** is present but **not in positions 1, 2, or 5**, so it must be in position 3 or 4.
- Letters **C, A, N, U, P, T** are absent from the secret word.

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** in the second position.
- Must include **E** (tested in position 3 to narrow down its location).
- Avoids excluded letters (**C, A, N, U, P, T**).
- Tests new common letters (e.g., **F, S, H**).

**FRESH** fits these criteria:
- **F** (new) in position 1.
- **R** (✓) in position 2.
- **E** (tested in position 3).
- **S** (new) in position 4.
- **H** (new) in position 5.

This guess will help identify if **E** is in position 3 and provide information about other letters.

But we know E is in the word and not in 1,2,5, so 3 or 4.\n  Position 4: same as above.\n  Position 5: unknown, but cannot be E (from guess 1).\n\nWe can try to guess a word that has E in position 3 and then if that doesn\'t work, we know it must be in position 4. Alternatively, we can try to test more new letters.\n\nWe also know that the word must have E and R, and we have only two positions left for E: 3 or 4.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have R in the second position and E in the third or fourth.\n\nFirst, E in the third position: _ R E _ _\n  We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with letters that are not in the excluded list (C, A, N, U, P, T) and are common.\n\nPossible letters: we can use B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nExamples:\n  - BREED: B R E E D -> but E is repeated? We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, D is new.\n  - However, we have to avoid the excluded letters. BREED: B, D are new and allowed.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. The feedback from the first guess only showed one E, but it could have more. Similarly, the second guess had only one E and it was marked present.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word with E in the fourth position: _ R _ E _\n\nExamples:\n  - GRUEL: but U is excluded (from guess 2: U is not in the word).\n  - FREED: F R E E D -> again, two E\'s? And we have F and D.\n\nBut we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother idea: since we have only two possible positions for E, we can choose a word that puts E in the third position and then if it\'s not there, we know it must be in the fourth. But we also want to test other letters.\n\nLet me try to list some words:\n\nFor E in the third position:\n  - BREW? -> 4 letters, too short.\n  - BRED? -> 4 letters.\n  - 5-letter words: \n      - BREAD -> but A is excluded.\n      - DREAD -> A excluded.\n      - FREED -> F R E E D (has two E\'s, but we don\'t mind testing)\n      - GREET -> G R E E T -> but T is excluded (from guess 2: T is not in the word).\n      - CREEP -> C excluded.\n      - PREEN -> P excluded.\n\nSo with E in the third, we have limited options because many common words have excluded letters.\n\nWhat about: \n  - BREME? Not a common word.\n  - BRERE? Not a word.\n\nHow about: \n  - BRIDE -> but I and D. However, we haven\'t excluded I and D. But note: in the first guess, we had E at the end and it was present but not at the end, so the word has an E. But in BRIDE, E is at the end. We cannot put E at the end because we know it\'s not at the end. So we must avoid E at the end.\n\nTherefore, for E in the third position, the fifth letter must not be E. Similarly, for E in the fourth position, the fifth letter must not be E.\n\nSo for E in the third: _ R E _ X (where X is not E and not excluded)\n\nExamples:\n  - BREWS? 5 letters? BREWS is 5 letters: B R E W S -> but W and S are new. And E in third.\n\nBut is BREWS a word? Yes, meaning of a type of beer? But let\'s check: it\'s a valid word.\n\n  - Alternatively, BRENS? But N is excluded.\n\n  - DRESS: D R E S S -> but we have two S\'s? And E in third. But S is new. However, we have to avoid T, but T is excluded so we are safe.\n\n  - But note: in the first guess, we had E at the fifth and it was present but not there, so the secret word has an E. In DRESS, we have E at the third and S at the fourth and fifth. We don\'t know if the secret word has S.\n\n  - Another: FRESH -> F R E S H -> H is new. And avoids excluded letters.\n\n  - Or: WRECK -> but C and K? C is excluded, so no.\n\n  - BLESS -> B L E S S -> but L is in position 2? We need R in position 2. So no.\n\n  - So we need R in position 2.\n\nNow, for E in the fourth position: _ R _ E _\n  Examples:\n    - GRACE -> but C and A excluded.\n    - PRICE -> P and C excluded.\n    - TRIPE -> T and P excluded.\n    - DRIVE -> D R I V E -> but E at the end? We cannot have E at the end. So we must avoid that.\n\n  - So the fifth letter must not be E. Therefore, we need a word like: _ R _ E X (where X is not E and not excluded)\n\n  - Examples: \n      - GRUEL -> but U excluded.\n      - GROVE -> but we have E at the end? No, GROVE has E at the end? G R O V E -> E at the fifth, which is not allowed. So avoid.\n\n  - How about: BRUTE -> but U and T excluded.\n\n  - CRONE -> C excluded.\n\n  - DRONE -> D R O N E -> but N excluded and E at the end.\n\n  - So we need a word that has a non-E at the end and E in the fourth.\n\n  - Examples: \n      - BRIDE -> but E at the end, so no.\n      - BRINE -> N excluded and E at the end.\n\n  - How about: TRADE -> T and A excluded.\n\n  - SHIRE -> S H I R E -> but R is in position 4? We need R in position 2. So no.\n\n  - We need R in position 2: so the pattern is: _ R ? E ?\n\n  - Let me think: ORATE? O R A T E -> but A and T excluded, and E at the end.\n\n  - Another: WRITE -> W R I T E -> T excluded and E at the end.\n\n  - So it\'s hard to find a word with E in the fourth and not at the end without excluded letters.\n\nGiven the difficulty, let\'s try to focus on E in the third position.\n\nWe have:\n  Position: 1: ?, 2: R, 3: E, 4: ?, 5: ? (and ? cannot be E and not excluded)\n\nWe have to choose letters for positions 1,4,5 from: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to test common letters to maximize information.\n\nPossible words:\n  - BREED: B R E E D -> but has two E\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has two E\'s. Also, we are testing E in the third, but if the secret word has only one E and we put two, we might get confusing feedback. However, it\'s acceptable because if the secret word has only one E, then one of the E\'s in BREED will be marked as absent? But wait, the feedback marks each letter individually. Actually, if the secret word has only one E, then the first E (in position 3) would be marked as present (if it is the correct one) and the second E (in position 4) would be marked as absent? But that might not be efficient.\n\n  - Instead, let\'s avoid multiple E\'s for now.\n\n  - How about: BRICK -> but C excluded.\n\n  - BRISK: B R I S K -> no E? But we must include E because we know E is in the word. So we cannot skip E.\n\n  - We must include E in the third position.\n\n  - So: _ R E _ _\n\n  Words without repeating E and without excluded letters:\n\n    - BREWS: B R E W S -> valid word. Letters: B, W, S are new.\n    - DRESS: D R E S S -> has two S\'s, but that\'s okay. Letters: D, S.\n    - FRESH: F R E S H -> letters: F, S, H.\n    - GRESS? Not a word.\n    - PRESS: P excluded.\n    - TRESS: T excluded.\n    - BREDE? Not common.\n    - BRERE? Not a word.\n    - BREME? Not common.\n\n  - Another: DREGS: D R E G S -> avoids excluded letters. And G and S are new.\n\n  - Or: GREWS? Not a word.\n\n  - So we have: BREWS, DRESS, FRESH, DREGS.\n\n  - Let\'s choose one that tests more common consonants.\n\n  - I think ""FRESH"" is a good candidate: it has F, S, H which are common.\n\n  - But note: we are putting E in the third position. If the secret word has E in the fourth, then this guess will show that E is not in the third, so we will know it must be in the fourth.\n\n  - Alternatively, we could choose a word that has E in the fourth position to test that.\n\nBut since we are having trouble finding a word with E in the fourth without excluded letters, let\'s go with E in the third.\n\nI choose ""FRESH"": F R E S H.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm: \n  F (position 1): new\n  R (position 2): correct\n  E (position 3): we are testing if E is here\n  S (position 4): new\n  H (position 5): new\n\nThis tests three new letters and checks the position of E.\n\nIf the feedback shows that E is not in the third position (i.e., marked as absent or wrong position) then we know E must be in the fourth position.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""FRESH"".\n\nBut note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""FRESH"" is a valid 5-letter word.\n\nTherefore, the third guess is ""FRESH"".\n\n<guess>fresh</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **R** is confirmed in the second position.\n- **E** is present but **not in positions 1, 2, or 5**, so it must be in position 3 or 4.\n- Letters **C, A, N, U, P, T** are absent from the secret word.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **R** in the second position.\n- Must include **E** (tested in position 3 to narrow down its location).\n- Avoids excluded letters (**C, A, N, U, P, T**).\n- Tests new common letters (e.g., **F, S, H**).\n\n**FRESH** fits these criteria:\n- **F** (new) in position 1.\n- **R** (✓) in position 2.\n- **E** (tested in position 3).\n- **S** (new) in position 4.\n- **H** (new) in position 5.\n\nThis guess will help identify if **E** is in position 3 and provide information about other letters.\n\n<guess>fresh</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: erupt -> FEEDBACK: E(-) R(✓) U(x) P(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: fresh -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) E(-) S(x) H(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the first three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, wrong position; so E is in the word but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""erupt""
  E: - (in word, wrong position; so E is not at position 1 or 5, and we already know not at 2, so E must be at 3 or 4)
  R: ✓ (correct, position 2)
  U: x (not in word)
  P: x (not in word)
  T: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ""fresh""
  F: x (not in word)
  R: ✓ (correct, position 2)
  E: - (in word, wrong position; but we put E at position 3, so this means E is not at position 3. Therefore, E must be at position 4, since the only remaining possibility is position 4)
  S: x (not in word)
  H: x (not in word)

So now we know:
- The secret word has the second letter R and the fourth letter E (because E must be at position 4, as we just deduced).
- The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, U, P, T, F, S, H.

Also, from the first guess, we know E is in the word and not at position 5, and now we know it's at position 4.

Therefore, the secret word pattern is: _ R _ E _

We need to fill in the first, third, and fifth positions.

The missing letters must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the known absent letters: C, A, N, U, P, T, F, S, H.

Remaining letters: B, D, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word has exactly these letters: one in position 1, one in position 3, one in position 5, and we have R in 2 and E in 4.

Now, we need to make a guess that fits this pattern and uses only the remaining letters.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible to narrow down.

The pattern: [letter1] R [letter3] E [letter5]

We can try to think of common words that fit this pattern.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters.

Let's list some words that match _ R _ E _:

- GRADE: but A is excluded.
- GRAPE: A and P excluded.
- GRIEF: but F excluded.
- BRIEF: B R I E F -> F is excluded.
- DRIVE: D R I V E -> but E is at the end? No, in our pattern, E is at position 4, so the word would be D R I V E, which has E at position 4? Let's count:
  D (1), R (2), I (3), V (4), E (5) -> no, that's not our pattern. Our pattern has E at position 4, so the fifth letter is after E.

The pattern is: position 1: ?, 2: R, 3: ?, 4: E, 5: ?

So for ""DRIVE"": 
  D (1), R (2), I (3), V (4), E (5) -> but that would be pattern _ R _ _ E, not _ R _ E _.

We need E at position 4, so the word should be: ? R ? E ?

Examples:
  - ORBED: O R B E D -> but D is allowed? Let's check: O, B, D are not excluded. 
  - However, we have to see if it's a valid word. ""ORBED"" means having the form of an orb; spherical. It's a valid word.

  - Other words:
    - ARBOR: but A excluded.
    - ARMOR: A excluded.
    - BROKE: B R O K E -> but E is at the end? Pattern: B(1), R(2), O(3), K(4), E(5) -> not matching because we need E at 4, but here E is at 5 and K is at 4.

  - We need the fourth letter to be E, so the fifth letter is something else.

  - How about: BRIDE: B R I D E -> but E is at the end? Pattern: B(1), R(2), I(3), D(4), E(5) -> again, E at 5, not at 4.

  - Correct pattern: the fourth letter is E, so the word has the form: ... E at the fourth position.

  - Example: TRUE: too short.

  - 5-letter words: 
      - GREBE: G R E B E -> but E is at position 3 and 5, not at 4. And we have E at 3? But we know E is at 4. So no.

  - Another: PROBE: P R O B E -> P excluded and E at the end.

  - How about: CRWTH? Not common and C excluded.

  - Let me search: 
      - WRITE: W R I T E -> T excluded and E at the end.

  - We need the fourth letter to be E: so the word must have the letter E in the fourth position.

  - Examples: 
      - OGRES: O G R E S -> but R is at position 3? We need R at position 2. So no.

  - We must have R at position 2 and E at position 4.

  - So: 
      - Position 1: any letter (not excluded)
      - Position 2: R
      - Position 3: any letter (not excluded)
      - Position 4: E
      - Position 5: any letter (not excluded)

  - Words: 
      - BREDE? Not common.
      - BREME? Not common.
      - BRERE? Not a word.
      - DREED? D R E E D -> but E at position 3 and 4? We have E at 4, but then position 3 is E? That would be two E's. But we don't know if the word has two E's. However, in the first guess, we had only one E and it was marked present. But it could have more. Similarly, in the second and third guesses, we only had one E and it was marked present. So it might have only one E? But we are putting E at position 4, so if we put E at position 3 as well, that would be two.

  - But note: the feedback for ""fresh"" had E at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't necessarily mean there is only one E. It could be that there is an E at position 4 and also one at position 3? But then the feedback would mark the E at position 3 as correct if it were in the word? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one E, and we put two E's, then one of them (the one in the correct position) would be marked as correct, and the other might be marked as absent? But in our case, for ""fresh"", we had E at position 3 and it was marked as present (the '-' meaning in the word but wrong position). That means that the secret word has an E, but not at position 3. So if the secret word had two E's, one at position 3 and one at position 4, then when we put E at position 3, it would be marked as correct (a check) because it's in the right position. But in the feedback, it was marked as '-' (wrong position), meaning that the E at position 3 is not correct, so the secret word does not have an E at position 3. Therefore, the secret word has exactly one E, and it is at position 4.

  - So we must not put E in any other position. Therefore, in our guess, we should not use E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5. Only position 4 is E.

  - Therefore, the word must be: [letter1] R [letter3] E [letter5] with letter1, letter3, letter5 not being E and not being any of the excluded letters.

  - Now, we need to find such words.

  - Let me think of common words: 
      - GRADE: A excluded.
      - GRIME: G R I M E -> but E is at the end? Pattern: G(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), E(5) -> no, we need E at 4, but here M is at 4 and E at 5.

  - We need the fourth letter to be E, so the word ends with E at the fourth and then a fifth letter.

  - Example: 
      - ARISE: A excluded.
      - BRINE: N excluded.
      - TRICE: T and C excluded.
      - ORIEL: O R I E L -> but E is at position 4? Let's see: O(1), R(2), I(3), E(4), L(5). Yes! And O, I, L are not excluded.

  - Is ""ORIEL"" a word? Yes, it means a type of bay window or a gallery. Valid.

  - Another: DRIED: D R I E D -> but E is at position 4? D(1), R(2), I(3), E(4), D(5). Yes. And D and I are allowed.

  - But note: we have two D's? That's okay.

  - Another: FRIED: F excluded.

  - GRIEF: F excluded.

  - PRIED: P excluded.

  - TRIED: T excluded.

  - So we have ""ORIEL"" and ""DRIED"".

  - Also: BRIBE: B R I B E -> but E at the end? Pattern: B(1), R(2), I(3), B(4), E(5) -> no, E at 5.

  - How about: BRIDE: B R I D E -> E at 5.

  - Another: WRECK: W R E C K -> but C excluded and E at 3? We need E at 4.

  - Let me try: CREDO? C excluded.

  - So back to ""ORIEL"" and ""DRIED"".

  - Also: ""BROKE"" -> E at 5.

  - ""GROVE"" -> E at 5.

  - ""TROVE"" -> T excluded.

  - ""DROVE"" -> same.

  - How about: ""GRUEL"" -> U excluded.

  - ""GRAIL"" -> A excluded.

  - ""TRAIL"" -> T and A excluded.

  - ""DRAWL"" -> A excluded? D R A W L -> A excluded.

  - ""GROWL"" -> G R O W L -> no E? We don't have E at position 4.

  - We must have E at position 4.

  - Another word: ""CREEL"" -> C excluded.

  - ""KREEP""? Not a word.

  - ""BREED"" -> E at 3 and 4? But we cannot have two E's? And we are not supposed to put E in position 3 because we know the secret word has only one E and it's at 4. So if we put E at 3, it would be incorrect and marked as absent? But we want to avoid that to save guesses.

  - So we should avoid using E in positions other than 4.

  - Therefore, let's consider ""ORIEL"" and ""DRIED"".

  - Also: ""BRIES""? Not common.

  - ""DRIES"": D R I E S -> but S is excluded (from guess 3: S is not in the word).

  - ""DRIED"": D R I E D -> S is not in this, and D and I are allowed.

  - ""ORIEL"": O R I E L -> O, I, L are allowed.

  - Another: ""CRIBS"" -> C excluded.

  - ""BROIL"": B R O I L -> no E? We need E at position 4.

  - So we must have E at 4.

  - How about: ""OWRIE""? Not a word.

  - ""ARIEL"": A excluded.

  - ""BRIBE"": E at the end.

  - I think ""ORIEL"" and ""DRIED"" are the main options.

  - Also: ""GRILL"" -> no E.

  - ""DROLL"" -> no E.

  - ""TROLL"" -> T excluded.

  - ""WRIED"": W R I E D -> W, R, I, E, D. Pattern: W(1), R(2), I(3), E(4), D(5). Yes! And W, I, D are not excluded.

  - ""WRIED"" is a word? It is the past tense of wry. Valid.

  - So we have: ORIEL, DRIED, WRIED.

  - We can choose one that uses more common letters or letters we haven't tried.

  - We haven't tried: B, D, G, I, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  - Among these, D, I, O, L, W are common.

  - ""ORIEL"" uses O, I, L.
  - ""DRIED"" uses D, I (and repeats D).
  - ""WRIED"" uses W, I, D.

  - Since we have limited guesses left (we are on the fourth guess, and we have 6 total), we want to maximize information.

  - But note: we are also trying to guess the word. We might be able to guess it.

  - Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests multiple possibilities.

  - However, we know the pattern is _ R _ E _ and we have three positions to fill. We can try to cover several common letters.

  - But we have only one guess left? No, we have three more guesses (since we are about to make the fourth guess, and we have 6 total).

  - We can try to use a word that has letters that appear in many possible words.

  - But the list of possible words is small. Let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and use only the allowed letters.

  - Allowed letters: B, D, G, I, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  - Words:
      - ORIEL: O, R, I, E, L
      - DRIED: D, R, I, E, D (but note: two D's? The secret word might have two D's? But we don't know. However, in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any repeated letters, but it's possible.)
      - WRIED: W, R, I, E, D
      - Also: BRIED? Not a word.
      - GRILL: no E.
      - DROVE: D R O V E -> but E at the end? No, we need E at 4. D(1), R(2), O(3), V(4), E(5) -> no.
      - GROVE: same.
      - How about: ""DROLE""? Not common, and no E at 4.
      - ""DRERE""? Not a word.
      - ""DREYE""? Not a word.
      - ""ORFE""? Not 5 letters.
      - ""ORZES""? O R Z E S -> but S excluded.
      - ""BROME"": B R O M E -> E at the end? No.
      - ""GRIDE"": G R I D E -> E at the end? Pattern: G(1), R(2), I(3), D(4), E(5) -> no.
      - ""GRISE"": G R I S E -> S excluded and E at the end.
      - ""KRONE"": K R O N E -> N excluded.
      - ""VROOM"": no E.
      - ""WRITE"": T excluded.
      - ""WROKE"": W R O K E -> E at the end.
      - ""WRIED"" is valid.

  - Another: ""DROID"" -> no E.

  - ""DROIL"" -> no E.

  - ""DROLE"" -> no E.

  - ""DROME"" -> E at the end.

  - So the only words I can think of are: ORIEL, DRIED, WRIED.

  - Also: ""BRIZE""? Not common.

  - ""ORIBI""? Not a word? Oribi is an animal, but it's 5 letters: O R I B I -> but no E? We need E at position 4.

  - So we have three candidates: ORIEL, DRIED, WRIED.

  - Now, we have to choose one for the next guess.

  - We can also consider that we have not tried the letter O, D, W, I, L.

  - If we guess ""ORIEL"", it tests O, I, L.
  - If we guess ""DRIED"", it tests D, I (and we already have D in the word, but we don't know if D is in the secret word).
  - Similarly, ""WRIED"" tests W, I, D.

  - Since we are limited, and we want to find the word, we might as well guess one of these.

  - But note: if we guess ""ORIEL"" and it's wrong, we get feedback that might help us distinguish between ""DRIED"" and ""WRIED"".

  - Similarly, if we guess ""DRIED"" and it's wrong, we might get feedback that points to ""ORIEL"" or ""WRIED"".

  - However, we have three possibilities and we have three guesses left (guesses 4,5,6). So we can afford to guess one.

  - Let's choose ""ORIEL"" because it uses three new letters (O, I, L) and doesn't repeat any.

  - So the fourth guess: ""ORIEL""

  - If it's not correct, we will get feedback on O, I, L.

  - Then we can decide between ""DRIED"" and ""WRIED"" for the next guess.

  - Alternatively, we could choose a word that is not necessarily a candidate but tests multiple letters. But we don't have many letters left to test, and we have only three positions to fill.

  - Since the pattern is fixed, we might as well guess a candidate.

  - Therefore, I choose ""ORIEL"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

1. **Guess 1: CRANE**  
   - C (absent), R (**correct position**), A (absent), N (absent), E (**present but wrong position**).  
   - **Key insights**:  
     - R is the **second letter** of the secret word.  
     - E is in the word but **not in position 5**.  
     - C, A, N are **absent**.  

2. **Guess 2: ERUPT**  
   - E (**present but wrong position**), R (**correct position**), U (absent), P (absent), T (absent).  
   - **Key insights**:  
     - E is **not in position 1** (since it was marked present but wrong position).  
     - Combined with Guess 1, E must be in **position 3 or 4** (positions 1, 2, and 5 are eliminated).  
     - U, P, T are **absent**.  

3. **Guess 3: FRESH**  
   - F (absent), R (**correct position**), E (**present but wrong position**), S (absent), H (absent).  
   - **Key insights**:  
     - E is **not in position 3** (marked present but wrong position).  
     - Since E must be in position 3 or 4 (from prior), it **must be in position 4**.  
     - F, S, H are **absent**.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ R _ E _`  
  - Position 2: **R** (fixed).  
  - Position 4: **E** (fixed).  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, U, P, T, F, S, H (cannot appear in the word).  
- **E is confirmed once** (no duplicates, based on feedback consistency).  
- **Remaining possible letters**: B, D, G, I, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We need to guess a 5-letter word fitting `_ R _ E _` using only the remaining letters.  
- Prioritize common letters (e.g., D, L, O, I, W) to test multiple possibilities.  
- **Candidate words** that fit the pattern and constraints:  
  - **ORIEL** (O, R, I, E, L): Tests O, I, L.  
  - **DRIED** (D, R, I, E, D): Tests D, I (repeated D).  
  - **WRIED** (W, R, I, E, D): Tests W, I, D.  
- **Why choose ORIEL?**  
  - Tests **three new letters** (O, I, L) without repetition.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on O/I/L will help differentiate between remaining candidates (e.g., DRIED or WRIED).  
  - Efficient for narrowing possibilities with one guess.  

### Next Guess: ORIEL  
- **Pattern**: `O R I E L`  
  - Tests position 1: **O**  
  - Tests position 3: **I**  
  - Tests position 5: **L**  

<guess>oriel</guess>",oriel,"We are given feedback for the first three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, wrong position; so E is in the word but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""erupt""
  E: - (in word, wrong position; so E is not at position 1 or 5, and we already know not at 2, so E must be at 3 or 4)
  R: ✓ (correct, position 2)
  U: x (not in word)
  P: x (not in word)
  T: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ""fresh""
  F: x (not in word)
  R: ✓ (correct, position 2)
  E: - (in word, wrong position; but we put E at position 3, so this means E is not at position 3. Therefore, E must be at position 4, since the only remaining possibility is position 4)
  S: x (not in word)
  H: x (not in word)

So now we know:
- The secret word has the second letter R and the fourth letter E (because E must be at position 4, as we just deduced).
- The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, U, P, T, F, S, H.

Also, from the first guess, we know E is in the word and not at position 5, and now we know it's at position 4.

Therefore, the secret word pattern is: _ R _ E _

We need to fill in the first, third, and fifth positions.

The missing letters must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the known absent letters: C, A, N, U, P, T, F, S, H.

Remaining letters: B, D, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word has exactly these letters: one in position 1, one in position 3, one in position 5, and we have R in 2 and E in 4.

Now, we need to make a guess that fits this pattern and uses only the remaining letters.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible to narrow down.

The pattern: [letter1] R [letter3] E [letter5]

We can try to think of common words that fit this pattern.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters.

Let's list some words that match _ R _ E _:

- GRADE: but A is excluded.
- GRAPE: A and P excluded.
- GRIEF: but F excluded.
- BRIEF: B R I E F -> F is excluded.
- DRIVE: D R I V E -> but E is at the end? No, in our pattern, E is at position 4, so the word would be D R I V E, which has E at position 4? Let's count:
  D (1), R (2), I (3), V (4), E (5) -> no, that's not our pattern. Our pattern has E at position 4, so the fifth letter is after E.

The pattern is: position 1: ?, 2: R, 3: ?, 4: E, 5: ?

So for ""DRIVE"": 
  D (1), R (2), I (3), V (4), E (5) -> but that would be pattern _ R _ _ E, not _ R _ E _.

We need E at position 4, so the word should be: ? R ? E ?

Examples:
  - ORBED: O R B E D -> but D is allowed? Let's check: O, B, D are not excluded. 
  - However, we have to see if it's a valid word. ""ORBED"" means having the form of an orb; spherical. It's a valid word.

  - Other words:
    - ARBOR: but A excluded.
    - ARMOR: A excluded.
    - BROKE: B R O K E -> but E is at the end? Pattern: B(1), R(2), O(3), K(4), E(5) -> not matching because we need E at 4, but here E is at 5 and K is at 4.

  - We need the fourth letter to be E, so the fifth letter is something else.

  - How about: BRIDE: B R I D E -> but E is at the end? Pattern: B(1), R(2), I(3), D(4), E(5) -> again, E at 5, not at 4.

  - Correct pattern: the fourth letter is E, so the word has the form: ... E at the fourth position.

  - Example: TRUE: too short.

  - 5-letter words: 
      - GREBE: G R E B E -> but E is at position 3 and 5, not at 4. And we have E at 3? But we know E is at 4. So no.

  - Another: PROBE: P R O B E -> P excluded and E at the end.

  - How about: CRWTH? Not common and C excluded.

  - Let me search: 
      - WRITE: W R I T E -> T excluded and E at the end.

  - We need the fourth letter to be E: so the word must have the letter E in the fourth position.

  - Examples: 
      - OGRES: O G R E S -> but R is at position 3? We need R at position 2. So no.

  - We must have R at position 2 and E at position 4.

  - So: 
      - Position 1: any letter (not excluded)
      - Position 2: R
      - Position 3: any letter (not excluded)
      - Position 4: E
      - Position 5: any letter (not excluded)

  - Words: 
      - BREDE? Not common.
      - BREME? Not common.
      - BRERE? Not a word.
      - DREED? D R E E D -> but E at position 3 and 4? We have E at 4, but then position 3 is E? That would be two E's. But we don't know if the word has two E's. However, in the first guess, we had only one E and it was marked present. But it could have more. Similarly, in the second and third guesses, we only had one E and it was marked present. So it might have only one E? But we are putting E at position 4, so if we put E at position 3 as well, that would be two.

  - But note: the feedback for ""fresh"" had E at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't necessarily mean there is only one E. It could be that there is an E at position 4 and also one at position 3? But then the feedback would mark the E at position 3 as correct if it were in the word? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one E, and we put two E's, then one of them (the one in the correct position) would be marked as correct, and the other might be marked as absent? But in our case, for ""fresh"", we had E at position 3 and it was marked as present (the '-' meaning in the word but wrong position). That means that the secret word has an E, but not at position 3. So if the secret word had two E's, one at position 3 and one at position 4, then when we put E at position 3, it would be marked as correct (a check) because it's in the right position. But in the feedback, it was marked as '-' (wrong position), meaning that the E at position 3 is not correct, so the secret word does not have an E at position 3. Therefore, the secret word has exactly one E, and it is at position 4.

  - So we must not put E in any other position. Therefore, in our guess, we should not use E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5. Only position 4 is E.

  - Therefore, the word must be: [letter1] R [letter3] E [letter5] with letter1, letter3, letter5 not being E and not being any of the excluded letters.

  - Now, we need to find such words.

  - Let me think of common words: 
      - GRADE: A excluded.
      - GRIME: G R I M E -> but E is at the end? Pattern: G(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), E(5) -> no, we need E at 4, but here M is at 4 and E at 5.

  - We need the fourth letter to be E, so the word ends with E at the fourth and then a fifth letter.

  - Example: 
      - ARISE: A excluded.
      - BRINE: N excluded.
      - TRICE: T and C excluded.
      - ORIEL: O R I E L -> but E is at position 4? Let's see: O(1), R(2), I(3), E(4), L(5). Yes! And O, I, L are not excluded.

  - Is ""ORIEL"" a word? Yes, it means a type of bay window or a gallery. Valid.

  - Another: DRIED: D R I E D -> but E is at position 4? D(1), R(2), I(3), E(4), D(5). Yes. And D and I are allowed.

  - But note: we have two D's? That's okay.

  - Another: FRIED: F excluded.

  - GRIEF: F excluded.

  - PRIED: P excluded.

  - TRIED: T excluded.

  - So we have ""ORIEL"" and ""DRIED"".

  - Also: BRIBE: B R I B E -> but E at the end? Pattern: B(1), R(2), I(3), B(4), E(5) -> no, E at 5.

  - How about: BRIDE: B R I D E -> E at 5.

  - Another: WRECK: W R E C K -> but C excluded and E at 3? We need E at 4.

  - Let me try: CREDO? C excluded.

  - So back to ""ORIEL"" and ""DRIED"".

  - Also: ""BROKE"" -> E at 5.

  - ""GROVE"" -> E at 5.

  - ""TROVE"" -> T excluded.

  - ""DROVE"" -> same.

  - How about: ""GRUEL"" -> U excluded.

  - ""GRAIL"" -> A excluded.

  - ""TRAIL"" -> T and A excluded.

  - ""DRAWL"" -> A excluded? D R A W L -> A excluded.

  - ""GROWL"" -> G R O W L -> no E? We don't have E at position 4.

  - We must have E at position 4.

  - Another word: ""CREEL"" -> C excluded.

  - ""KREEP""? Not a word.

  - ""BREED"" -> E at 3 and 4? But we cannot have two E's? And we are not supposed to put E in position 3 because we know the secret word has only one E and it's at 4. So if we put E at 3, it would be incorrect and marked as absent? But we want to avoid that to save guesses.

  - So we should avoid using E in positions other than 4.

  - Therefore, let's consider ""ORIEL"" and ""DRIED"".

  - Also: ""BRIES""? Not common.

  - ""DRIES"": D R I E S -> but S is excluded (from guess 3: S is not in the word).

  - ""DRIED"": D R I E D -> S is not in this, and D and I are allowed.

  - ""ORIEL"": O R I E L -> O, I, L are allowed.

  - Another: ""CRIBS"" -> C excluded.

  - ""BROIL"": B R O I L -> no E? We need E at position 4.

  - So we must have E at 4.

  - How about: ""OWRIE""? Not a word.

  - ""ARIEL"": A excluded.

  - ""BRIBE"": E at the end.

  - I think ""ORIEL"" and ""DRIED"" are the main options.

  - Also: ""GRILL"" -> no E.

  - ""DROLL"" -> no E.

  - ""TROLL"" -> T excluded.

  - ""WRIED"": W R I E D -> W, R, I, E, D. Pattern: W(1), R(2), I(3), E(4), D(5). Yes! And W, I, D are not excluded.

  - ""WRIED"" is a word? It is the past tense of wry. Valid.

  - So we have: ORIEL, DRIED, WRIED.

  - We can choose one that uses more common letters or letters we haven't tried.

  - We haven't tried: B, D, G, I, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  - Among these, D, I, O, L, W are common.

  - ""ORIEL"" uses O, I, L.
  - ""DRIED"" uses D, I (and repeats D).
  - ""WRIED"" uses W, I, D.

  - Since we have limited guesses left (we are on the fourth guess, and we have 6 total), we want to maximize information.

  - But note: we are also trying to guess the word. We might be able to guess it.

  - Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests multiple possibilities.

      - GROVE: same.
      - How about: ""DROLE""? Not common, and no E at 4.
      - ""DRERE""? Not a word.
      - ""DREYE""? Not a word.
      - ""ORFE""? Not 5 letters.
      - ""ORZES""? O R Z E S -> but S excluded.
      - ""BROME"": B R O M E -> E at the end? No.
      - ""GRIDE"": G R I D E -> E at the end? Pattern: G(1), R(2), I(3), D(4), E(5) -> no.
      - ""GRISE"": G R I S E -> S excluded and E at the end.
      - ""KRONE"": K R O N E -> N excluded.
      - ""VROOM"": no E.
      - ""WRITE"": T excluded.
      - ""WROKE"": W R O K E -> E at the end.
      - ""WRIED"" is valid.

  - Another: ""DROID"" -> no E.

  - ""DROIL"" -> no E.

  - ""DROLE"" -> no E.

  - ""DROME"" -> E at the end.

  - So the only words I can think of are: ORIEL, DRIED, WRIED.

  - Also: ""BRIZE""? Not common.

  - ""ORIBI""? Not a word? Oribi is an animal, but it's 5 letters: O R I B I -> but no E? We need E at position 4.

  - So we have three candidates: ORIEL, DRIED, WRIED.

  - Now, we have to choose one for the next guess.

  - We can also consider that we have not tried the letter O, D, W, I, L.

  - If we guess ""ORIEL"", it tests O, I, L.
  - If we guess ""DRIED"", it tests D, I (and we already have D in the word, but we don't know if D is in the secret word).
  - Similarly, ""WRIED"" tests W, I, D.

  - Since the pattern is fixed, we might as well guess a candidate.

  - Therefore, I choose ""ORIEL"".

2. **Guess 2: ERUPT**  
   - E (**present but wrong position**), R (**correct position**), U (absent), P (absent), T (absent).  
   - **Key insights**:  
     - E is **not in position 1** (since it was marked present but wrong position).  
     - Combined with Guess 1, E must be in **position 3 or 4** (positions 1, 2, and 5 are eliminated).  
     - U, P, T are **absent**.  

3. **Guess 3: FRESH**  
   - F (absent), R (**correct position**), E (**present but wrong position**), S (absent), H (absent).  
   - **Key insights**:  
     - E is **not in position 3** (marked present but wrong position).  
     - Since E must be in position 3 or 4 (from prior), it **must be in position 4**.  
     - F, S, H are **absent**.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ R _ E _`  
  - Position 2: **R** (fixed).  
  - Position 4: **E** (fixed).  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, U, P, T, F, S, H (cannot appear in the word).  
- **E is confirmed once** (no duplicates, based on feedback consistency).  
- **Remaining possible letters**: B, D, G, I, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We need to guess a 5-letter word fitting `_ R _ E _` using only the remaining letters.  
- Prioritize common letters (e.g., D, L, O, I, W) to test multiple possibilities.  
- **Candidate words** that fit the pattern and constraints:  
  - **ORIEL** (O, R, I, E, L): Tests O, I, L.  
  - **DRIED** (D, R, I, E, D): Tests D, I (repeated D).  
  - **WRIED** (W, R, I, E, D): Tests W, I, D.  
- **Why choose ORIEL?**  
  - Tests **three new letters** (O, I, L) without repetition.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on O/I/L will help differentiate between remaining candidates (e.g., DRIED or WRIED).  
  - Efficient for narrowing possibilities with one guess.  

### Next Guess: ORIEL  
- **Pattern**: `O R I E L`  
  - Tests position 1: **O**  
  - Tests position 3: **I**  
  - Tests position 5: **L**",Guess 4: oriel -> FEEDBACK: O(x) R(✓) I(✓) E(✓) L(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,DRIED,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).
   - It doesn't repeat any letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter of the secret word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, from this we know:
  - The second letter is R.
  - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position (since we guessed it at the fifth and it's marked as wrong position).
  - The letters C, A, N are not in the word.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters and we have to avoid C, A, N.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, it must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 4.

 Now, we need to make a second guess that:
  - Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
  - Includes the letter E (because it's in the secret word) but not at the fifth position.
  - Has R as the second letter.
  - Avoids the letters C, A, N.

 Let's think of words that have R in the second position and include E.

 Some possibilities:
  - BREW: B R E W -> but we need 5 letters, so too short.
  - BRED: B R E D -> 4 letters, too short.

 We need 5-letter words. Let's try:

  - BRIDE: B R I D E -> but E is at the end, and we know E cannot be at the end (because in the first guess E was at the end and marked as wrong position). So if we put E at the end again, it might be the same. But note: the secret word might have two E's? However, we don't know. But the feedback only showed one E in the word (since only one E was in the guess and it was marked as present). So it's safer to avoid putting E at the end.

  - We can try to put E in the first, third, or fourth position.

 Let me think of words with R in the second position and E in the first? 
  - ERECT: E R E C T -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word) and also has two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's. However, we must avoid C. So not this.

  - How about E in the third position?
    - WORD: _ R E _ _
    Examples: 
      - FREED: F R E E D -> but has two E's and we don't know if that's allowed. Also, we have to avoid A, C, N. This avoids them. But note: we have E in the third and fourth positions. However, the secret word has at least one E, but we don't know about two. Also, in the first guess, we had only one E and it was marked as present, so it might have only one. But it could have more. We can try.

  - But we also have to consider that the secret word has R in the second position and E somewhere else.

  - Another idea: PREY? 4 letters. Not 5.

  - TREND: T R E N D -> but N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So avoid.

  - BRUTE: B R U T E -> E is at the end. We want to avoid E at the end? But note: the feedback said E is in the word but not at the fifth position. So if we put E at the end, it will be wrong again. So we should avoid that.

  - How about E in the fourth position?
    - _ R _ E _
    Examples: 
      - GRUEL: G R U E L -> This has E in the fourth position. And avoids C, A, N. Also, G, U, L are new letters.

  - Another: PROBE: P R O B E -> but E at the end, so avoid.

  - BRINE: B R I N E -> but N is not allowed.

  - How about BRISK? But we don't know the word yet. And we have to avoid A, C, N. But we don't know if S and K are in the word.

  - Another word: GROVE: G R O V E -> E at the end, avoid.

  - Let me try to put E in the first position: 
    - E R _ _ _
    Examples: 
      - ERUPT: E R U P T -> avoids C, A, N. And E is at the first position. This is a valid word.

  - Also: ERECT is invalid because of C.

  - Another: ERODE: E R O D E -> has two E's? But we don't know. And O and D are new.

  - We can also try E in the third position: 
    - _ R E _ _
    Examples: 
      - TRESS: T R E S S -> but T was in the first guess? In the first guess, we had C (x), R (✓), A (x), N (x), E (-). So T is new? Actually, we haven't tried T. But note: the first guess didn't have T. So T might be in the word or not. Also, we have two S's? 

  - Another: FREAK: F R E A K -> but A is not allowed.

  - BREAK: B R E A K -> A not allowed.

  - DREGS: D R E G S -> avoids A, C, N. And E is in the third position.

  - Or: DRESS: D R E S S -> same as above.

  - But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Considering the above, I think ""ERUPT"" and ""DREGS"" are good candidates.

 However, we also know that the secret word does not have A, C, N. So we can use other letters.

 Let me choose ""ERUPT"" because:
   - It has E in the first position (which we haven't tested) and R in the second (which we know is correct).
   - It introduces three new letters: U, P, T.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has E in the fourth position? But we haven't tried that.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not at the fifth. So it could be in the first, third, or fourth. We are testing the first position with ""ERUPT"".

 So, let's go with ""ERUPT"".

<guess>erupt</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, A, N** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **R** is correct and in the second position (marked ""✓"").
- **E** is present but not in the fifth position (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- Must include **R** as the second letter.
- Must include **E** (since it's in the secret word), but **not in the fifth position**.
- Must avoid **C, A, N**.
- Should test new letters to gather more information.

The word **ERUPT** fits these criteria:
- **E** is in the first position (testing a new spot for E).
- **R** is in the second position (confirmed correct).
- Introduces new letters: **U, P, T** (to check for presence/absence).

<guess>erupt</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: erupt -> FEEDBACK: E(-) R(✓) U(x) P(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""erupt""
  E: - (in the word, but not in position 1) -> so E is present but not at position 1 or 5.
  R: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
  U: x (not in the word)
  P: x (not in the word)
  T: x (not in the word)

What we know so far:
- The secret word has 5 letters.
- The second letter is R (from both guesses).
- The letter E is in the word, but not in position 1, 2 (because R is there), or 5. So it must be in position 3 or 4.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, U, P, T.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Has R as the second letter.
- Includes the letter E in either position 3 or 4 (to find out exactly where it is).
- Avoids the letters C, A, N, U, P, T.

Since E must be in position 3 or 4, we can try to cover both possibilities by choosing a word that has E in one of these positions and also tests other common letters.

Let's consider the positions:
  Position 1: unknown, but cannot be E (from guess 2) and cannot be any of the excluded letters.
  Position 2: R (fixed)
  Position 3: could be E or another letter? But we know E is in the word and not in 1,2,5, so 3 or 4.
  Position 4: same as above.
  Position 5: unknown, but cannot be E (from guess 1).

We can try to guess a word that has E in position 3 and then if that doesn't work, we know it must be in position 4. Alternatively, we can try to test more new letters.

We also know that the word must have E and R, and we have only two positions left for E: 3 or 4.

Let's think of words that have R in the second position and E in the third or fourth.

First, E in the third position: _ R E _ _
  We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with letters that are not in the excluded list (C, A, N, U, P, T) and are common.

Possible letters: we can use B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Examples:
  - BREED: B R E E D -> but E is repeated? We don't know if the word has two E's. Also, D is new.
  - However, we have to avoid the excluded letters. BREED: B, D are new and allowed.

But note: we don't know if the word has two E's. The feedback from the first guess only showed one E, but it could have more. Similarly, the second guess had only one E and it was marked present.

Alternatively, we can try a word with E in the fourth position: _ R _ E _

Examples:
  - GRUEL: but U is excluded (from guess 2: U is not in the word).
  - FREED: F R E E D -> again, two E's? And we have F and D.

But we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since we have only two possible positions for E, we can choose a word that puts E in the third position and then if it's not there, we know it must be in the fourth. But we also want to test other letters.

Let me try to list some words:

For E in the third position:
  - BREW? -> 4 letters, too short.
  - BRED? -> 4 letters.
  - 5-letter words: 
      - BREAD -> but A is excluded.
      - DREAD -> A excluded.
      - FREED -> F R E E D (has two E's, but we don't mind testing)
      - GREET -> G R E E T -> but T is excluded (from guess 2: T is not in the word).
      - CREEP -> C excluded.
      - PREEN -> P excluded.

So with E in the third, we have limited options because many common words have excluded letters.

What about: 
  - BREME? Not a common word.
  - BRERE? Not a word.

How about: 
  - BRIDE -> but I and D. However, we haven't excluded I and D. But note: in the first guess, we had E at the end and it was present but not at the end, so the word has an E. But in BRIDE, E is at the end. We cannot put E at the end because we know it's not at the end. So we must avoid E at the end.

Therefore, for E in the third position, the fifth letter must not be E. Similarly, for E in the fourth position, the fifth letter must not be E.

So for E in the third: _ R E _ X (where X is not E and not excluded)

Examples:
  - BREWS? 5 letters? BREWS is 5 letters: B R E W S -> but W and S are new. And E in third.

But is BREWS a word? Yes, meaning of a type of beer? But let's check: it's a valid word.

  - Alternatively, BRENS? But N is excluded.

  - DRESS: D R E S S -> but we have two S's? And E in third. But S is new. However, we have to avoid T, but T is excluded so we are safe.

  - But note: in the first guess, we had E at the fifth and it was present but not there, so the secret word has an E. In DRESS, we have E at the third and S at the fourth and fifth. We don't know if the secret word has S.

  - Another: FRESH -> F R E S H -> H is new. And avoids excluded letters.

  - Or: WRECK -> but C and K? C is excluded, so no.

  - BLESS -> B L E S S -> but L is in position 2? We need R in position 2. So no.

  - So we need R in position 2.

Now, for E in the fourth position: _ R _ E _
  Examples:
    - GRACE -> but C and A excluded.
    - PRICE -> P and C excluded.
    - TRIPE -> T and P excluded.
    - DRIVE -> D R I V E -> but E at the end? We cannot have E at the end. So we must avoid that.

  - So the fifth letter must not be E. Therefore, we need a word like: _ R _ E X (where X is not E and not excluded)

  - Examples: 
      - GRUEL -> but U excluded.
      - GROVE -> but we have E at the end? No, GROVE has E at the end? G R O V E -> E at the fifth, which is not allowed. So avoid.

  - How about: BRUTE -> but U and T excluded.

  - CRONE -> C excluded.

  - DRONE -> D R O N E -> but N excluded and E at the end.

  - So we need a word that has a non-E at the end and E in the fourth.

  - Examples: 
      - BRIDE -> but E at the end, so no.
      - BRINE -> N excluded and E at the end.

  - How about: TRADE -> T and A excluded.

  - SHIRE -> S H I R E -> but R is in position 4? We need R in position 2. So no.

  - We need R in position 2: so the pattern is: _ R ? E ?

  - Let me think: ORATE? O R A T E -> but A and T excluded, and E at the end.

  - Another: WRITE -> W R I T E -> T excluded and E at the end.

  - So it's hard to find a word with E in the fourth and not at the end without excluded letters.

Given the difficulty, let's try to focus on E in the third position.

We have:
  Position: 1: ?, 2: R, 3: E, 4: ?, 5: ? (and ? cannot be E and not excluded)

We have to choose letters for positions 1,4,5 from: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test common letters to maximize information.

Possible words:
  - BREED: B R E E D -> but has two E's. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. Also, we are testing E in the third, but if the secret word has only one E and we put two, we might get confusing feedback. However, it's acceptable because if the secret word has only one E, then one of the E's in BREED will be marked as absent? But wait, the feedback marks each letter individually. Actually, if the secret word has only one E, then the first E (in position 3) would be marked as present (if it is the correct one) and the second E (in position 4) would be marked as absent? But that might not be efficient.

  - Instead, let's avoid multiple E's for now.

  - How about: BRICK -> but C excluded.

  - BRISK: B R I S K -> no E? But we must include E because we know E is in the word. So we cannot skip E.

  - We must include E in the third position.

  - So: _ R E _ _

  Words without repeating E and without excluded letters:

    - BREWS: B R E W S -> valid word. Letters: B, W, S are new.
    - DRESS: D R E S S -> has two S's, but that's okay. Letters: D, S.
    - FRESH: F R E S H -> letters: F, S, H.
    - GRESS? Not a word.
    - PRESS: P excluded.
    - TRESS: T excluded.
    - BREDE? Not common.
    - BRERE? Not a word.
    - BREME? Not common.

  - Another: DREGS: D R E G S -> avoids excluded letters. And G and S are new.

  - Or: GREWS? Not a word.

  - So we have: BREWS, DRESS, FRESH, DREGS.

  - Let's choose one that tests more common consonants.

  - I think ""FRESH"" is a good candidate: it has F, S, H which are common.

  - But note: we are putting E in the third position. If the secret word has E in the fourth, then this guess will show that E is not in the third, so we will know it must be in the fourth.

  - Alternatively, we could choose a word that has E in the fourth position to test that.

But since we are having trouble finding a word with E in the fourth without excluded letters, let's go with E in the third.

I choose ""FRESH"": F R E S H.

But wait, let me confirm: 
  F (position 1): new
  R (position 2): correct
  E (position 3): we are testing if E is here
  S (position 4): new
  H (position 5): new

This tests three new letters and checks the position of E.

If the feedback shows that E is not in the third position (i.e., marked as absent or wrong position) then we know E must be in the fourth position.

So, let's go with ""FRESH"".

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""FRESH"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Therefore, the third guess is ""FRESH"".

<guess>fresh</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **R** is confirmed in the second position.
- **E** is present but **not in positions 1, 2, or 5**, so it must be in position 3 or 4.
- Letters **C, A, N, U, P, T** are absent from the secret word.

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** in the second position.
- Must include **E** (tested in position 3 to narrow down its location).
- Avoids excluded letters (**C, A, N, U, P, T**).
- Tests new common letters (e.g., **F, S, H**).

**FRESH** fits these criteria:
- **F** (new) in position 1.
- **R** (✓) in position 2.
- **E** (tested in position 3).
- **S** (new) in position 4.
- **H** (new) in position 5.

This guess will help identify if **E** is in position 3 and provide information about other letters.

<guess>fresh</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: erupt -> FEEDBACK: E(-) R(✓) U(x) P(x) T(x)
Guess 3: fresh -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) E(-) S(x) H(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, wrong position; so E is in the word but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""erupt""
  E: - (in word, wrong position; so E is not at position 1 or 5, and we already know not at 2, so E must be at 3 or 4)
  R: ✓ (correct, position 2)
  U: x (not in word)
  P: x (not in word)
  T: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ""fresh""
  F: x (not in word)
  R: ✓ (correct, position 2)
  E: - (in word, wrong position; but we put E at position 3, so this means E is not at position 3. Therefore, E must be at position 4, since the only remaining possibility is position 4)
  S: x (not in word)
  H: x (not in word)

So now we know:
- The secret word has the second letter R and the fourth letter E (because E must be at position 4, as we just deduced).
- The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, U, P, T, F, S, H.

Also, from the first guess, we know E is in the word and not at position 5, and now we know it's at position 4.

Therefore, the secret word pattern is: _ R _ E _

We need to fill in the first, third, and fifth positions.

The missing letters must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the known absent letters: C, A, N, U, P, T, F, S, H.

Remaining letters: B, D, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word has exactly these letters: one in position 1, one in position 3, one in position 5, and we have R in 2 and E in 4.

Now, we need to make a guess that fits this pattern and uses only the remaining letters.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible to narrow down.

The pattern: [letter1] R [letter3] E [letter5]

We can try to think of common words that fit this pattern.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters.

Let's list some words that match _ R _ E _:

- GRADE: but A is excluded.
- GRAPE: A and P excluded.
- GRIEF: but F excluded.
- BRIEF: B R I E F -> F is excluded.
- DRIVE: D R I V E -> but E is at the end? No, in our pattern, E is at position 4, so the word would be D R I V E, which has E at position 4? Let's count:
  D (1), R (2), I (3), V (4), E (5) -> no, that's not our pattern. Our pattern has E at position 4, so the fifth letter is after E.

The pattern is: position 1: ?, 2: R, 3: ?, 4: E, 5: ?

So for ""DRIVE"": 
  D (1), R (2), I (3), V (4), E (5) -> but that would be pattern _ R _ _ E, not _ R _ E _.

We need E at position 4, so the word should be: ? R ? E ?

Examples:
  - ORBED: O R B E D -> but D is allowed? Let's check: O, B, D are not excluded. 
  - However, we have to see if it's a valid word. ""ORBED"" means having the form of an orb; spherical. It's a valid word.

  - Other words:
    - ARBOR: but A excluded.
    - ARMOR: A excluded.
    - BROKE: B R O K E -> but E is at the end? Pattern: B(1), R(2), O(3), K(4), E(5) -> not matching because we need E at 4, but here E is at 5 and K is at 4.

  - We need the fourth letter to be E, so the fifth letter is something else.

  - How about: BRIDE: B R I D E -> but E is at the end? Pattern: B(1), R(2), I(3), D(4), E(5) -> again, E at 5, not at 4.

  - Correct pattern: the fourth letter is E, so the word has the form: ... E at the fourth position.

  - Example: TRUE: too short.

  - 5-letter words: 
      - GREBE: G R E B E -> but E is at position 3 and 5, not at 4. And we have E at 3? But we know E is at 4. So no.

  - Another: PROBE: P R O B E -> P excluded and E at the end.

  - How about: CRWTH? Not common and C excluded.

  - Let me search: 
      - WRITE: W R I T E -> T excluded and E at the end.

  - We need the fourth letter to be E: so the word must have the letter E in the fourth position.

  - Examples: 
      - OGRES: O G R E S -> but R is at position 3? We need R at position 2. So no.

  - We must have R at position 2 and E at position 4.

  - So: 
      - Position 1: any letter (not excluded)
      - Position 2: R
      - Position 3: any letter (not excluded)
      - Position 4: E
      - Position 5: any letter (not excluded)

  - Words: 
      - BREDE? Not common.
      - BREME? Not common.
      - BRERE? Not a word.
      - DREED? D R E E D -> but E at position 3 and 4? We have E at 4, but then position 3 is E? That would be two E's. But we don't know if the word has two E's. However, in the first guess, we had only one E and it was marked present. But it could have more. Similarly, in the second and third guesses, we only had one E and it was marked present. So it might have only one E? But we are putting E at position 4, so if we put E at position 3 as well, that would be two.

  - But note: the feedback for ""fresh"" had E at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't necessarily mean there is only one E. It could be that there is an E at position 4 and also one at position 3? But then the feedback would mark the E at position 3 as correct if it were in the word? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one E, and we put two E's, then one of them (the one in the correct position) would be marked as correct, and the other might be marked as absent? But in our case, for ""fresh"", we had E at position 3 and it was marked as present (the '-' meaning in the word but wrong position). That means that the secret word has an E, but not at position 3. So if the secret word had two E's, one at position 3 and one at position 4, then when we put E at position 3, it would be marked as correct (a check) because it's in the right position. But in the feedback, it was marked as '-' (wrong position), meaning that the E at position 3 is not correct, so the secret word does not have an E at position 3. Therefore, the secret word has exactly one E, and it is at position 4.

  - So we must not put E in any other position. Therefore, in our guess, we should not use E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5. Only position 4 is E.

  - Therefore, the word must be: [letter1] R [letter3] E [letter5] with letter1, letter3, letter5 not being E and not being any of the excluded letters.

  - Now, we need to find such words.

  - Let me think of common words: 
      - GRADE: A excluded.
      - GRIME: G R I M E -> but E is at the end? Pattern: G(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), E(5) -> no, we need E at 4, but here M is at 4 and E at 5.

  - We need the fourth letter to be E, so the word ends with E at the fourth and then a fifth letter.

  - Example: 
      - ARISE: A excluded.
      - BRINE: N excluded.
      - TRICE: T and C excluded.
      - ORIEL: O R I E L -> but E is at position 4? Let's see: O(1), R(2), I(3), E(4), L(5). Yes! And O, I, L are not excluded.

  - Is ""ORIEL"" a word? Yes, it means a type of bay window or a gallery. Valid.

  - Another: DRIED: D R I E D -> but E is at position 4? D(1), R(2), I(3), E(4), D(5). Yes. And D and I are allowed.

  - But note: we have two D's? That's okay.

  - Another: FRIED: F excluded.

  - GRIEF: F excluded.

  - PRIED: P excluded.

  - TRIED: T excluded.

  - So we have ""ORIEL"" and ""DRIED"".

  - Also: BRIBE: B R I B E -> but E at the end? Pattern: B(1), R(2), I(3), B(4), E(5) -> no, E at 5.

  - How about: BRIDE: B R I D E -> E at 5.

  - Another: WRECK: W R E C K -> but C excluded and E at 3? We need E at 4.

  - Let me try: CREDO? C excluded.

  - So back to ""ORIEL"" and ""DRIED"".

  - Also: ""BROKE"" -> E at 5.

  - ""GROVE"" -> E at 5.

  - ""TROVE"" -> T excluded.

  - ""DROVE"" -> same.

  - How about: ""GRUEL"" -> U excluded.

  - ""GRAIL"" -> A excluded.

  - ""TRAIL"" -> T and A excluded.

  - ""DRAWL"" -> A excluded? D R A W L -> A excluded.

  - ""GROWL"" -> G R O W L -> no E? We don't have E at position 4.

  - We must have E at position 4.

  - Another word: ""CREEL"" -> C excluded.

  - ""KREEP""? Not a word.

  - ""BREED"" -> E at 3 and 4? But we cannot have two E's? And we are not supposed to put E in position 3 because we know the secret word has only one E and it's at 4. So if we put E at 3, it would be incorrect and marked as absent? But we want to avoid that to save guesses.

  - So we should avoid using E in positions other than 4.

  - Therefore, let's consider ""ORIEL"" and ""DRIED"".

  - Also: ""BRIES""? Not common.

  - ""DRIES"": D R I E S -> but S is excluded (from guess 3: S is not in the word).

  - ""DRIED"": D R I E D -> S is not in this, and D and I are allowed.

  - ""ORIEL"": O R I E L -> O, I, L are allowed.

  - Another: ""CRIBS"" -> C excluded.

  - ""BROIL"": B R O I L -> no E? We need E at position 4.

  - So we must have E at 4.

  - How about: ""OWRIE""? Not a word.

  - ""ARIEL"": A excluded.

  - ""BRIBE"": E at the end.

  - I think ""ORIEL"" and ""DRIED"" are the main options.

  - Also: ""GRILL"" -> no E.

  - ""DROLL"" -> no E.

  - ""TROLL"" -> T excluded.

  - ""WRIED"": W R I E D -> W, R, I, E, D. Pattern: W(1), R(2), I(3), E(4), D(5). Yes! And W, I, D are not excluded.

  - ""WRIED"" is a word? It is the past tense of wry. Valid.

  - So we have: ORIEL, DRIED, WRIED.

  - We can choose one that uses more common letters or letters we haven't tried.

  - We haven't tried: B, D, G, I, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  - Among these, D, I, O, L, W are common.

  - ""ORIEL"" uses O, I, L.
  - ""DRIED"" uses D, I (and repeats D).
  - ""WRIED"" uses W, I, D.

  - Since we have limited guesses left (we are on the fourth guess, and we have 6 total), we want to maximize information.

  - But note: we are also trying to guess the word. We might be able to guess it.

  - Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests multiple possibilities.

  - However, we know the pattern is _ R _ E _ and we have three positions to fill. We can try to cover several common letters.

  - But we have only one guess left? No, we have three more guesses (since we are about to make the fourth guess, and we have 6 total).

  - We can try to use a word that has letters that appear in many possible words.

  - But the list of possible words is small. Let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and use only the allowed letters.

  - Allowed letters: B, D, G, I, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  - Words:
      - ORIEL: O, R, I, E, L
      - DRIED: D, R, I, E, D (but note: two D's? The secret word might have two D's? But we don't know. However, in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any repeated letters, but it's possible.)
      - WRIED: W, R, I, E, D
      - Also: BRIED? Not a word.
      - GRILL: no E.
      - DROVE: D R O V E -> but E at the end? No, we need E at 4. D(1), R(2), O(3), V(4), E(5) -> no.
      - GROVE: same.
      - How about: ""DROLE""? Not common, and no E at 4.
      - ""DRERE""? Not a word.
      - ""DREYE""? Not a word.
      - ""ORFE""? Not 5 letters.
      - ""ORZES""? O R Z E S -> but S excluded.
      - ""BROME"": B R O M E -> E at the end? No.
      - ""GRIDE"": G R I D E -> E at the end? Pattern: G(1), R(2), I(3), D(4), E(5) -> no.
      - ""GRISE"": G R I S E -> S excluded and E at the end.
      - ""KRONE"": K R O N E -> N excluded.
      - ""VROOM"": no E.
      - ""WRITE"": T excluded.
      - ""WROKE"": W R O K E -> E at the end.
      - ""WRIED"" is valid.

  - Another: ""DROID"" -> no E.

  - ""DROIL"" -> no E.

  - ""DROLE"" -> no E.

  - ""DROME"" -> E at the end.

  - So the only words I can think of are: ORIEL, DRIED, WRIED.

  - Also: ""BRIZE""? Not common.

  - ""ORIBI""? Not a word? Oribi is an animal, but it's 5 letters: O R I B I -> but no E? We need E at position 4.

  - So we have three candidates: ORIEL, DRIED, WRIED.

  - Now, we have to choose one for the next guess.

  - We can also consider that we have not tried the letter O, D, W, I, L.

  - If we guess ""ORIEL"", it tests O, I, L.
  - If we guess ""DRIED"", it tests D, I (and we already have D in the word, but we don't know if D is in the secret word).
  - Similarly, ""WRIED"" tests W, I, D.

  - Since we are limited, and we want to find the word, we might as well guess one of these.

  - But note: if we guess ""ORIEL"" and it's wrong, we get feedback that might help us distinguish between ""DRIED"" and ""WRIED"".

  - Similarly, if we guess ""DRIED"" and it's wrong, we might get feedback that points to ""ORIEL"" or ""WRIED"".

  - However, we have three possibilities and we have three guesses left (guesses 4,5,6). So we can afford to guess one.

  - Let's choose ""ORIEL"" because it uses three new letters (O, I, L) and doesn't repeat any.

  - So the fourth guess: ""ORIEL""

  - If it's not correct, we will get feedback on O, I, L.

  - Then we can decide between ""DRIED"" and ""WRIED"" for the next guess.

  - Alternatively, we could choose a word that is not necessarily a candidate but tests multiple letters. But we don't have many letters left to test, and we have only three positions to fill.

  - Since the pattern is fixed, we might as well guess a candidate.

  - Therefore, I choose ""ORIEL"".

<guess>oriel</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

1. **Guess 1: CRANE**  
   - C (absent), R (**correct position**), A (absent), N (absent), E (**present but wrong position**).  
   - **Key insights**:  
     - R is the **second letter** of the secret word.  
     - E is in the word but **not in position 5**.  
     - C, A, N are **absent**.  

2. **Guess 2: ERUPT**  
   - E (**present but wrong position**), R (**correct position**), U (absent), P (absent), T (absent).  
   - **Key insights**:  
     - E is **not in position 1** (since it was marked present but wrong position).  
     - Combined with Guess 1, E must be in **position 3 or 4** (positions 1, 2, and 5 are eliminated).  
     - U, P, T are **absent**.  

3. **Guess 3: FRESH**  
   - F (absent), R (**correct position**), E (**present but wrong position**), S (absent), H (absent).  
   - **Key insights**:  
     - E is **not in position 3** (marked present but wrong position).  
     - Since E must be in position 3 or 4 (from prior), it **must be in position 4**.  
     - F, S, H are **absent**.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ R _ E _`  
  - Position 2: **R** (fixed).  
  - Position 4: **E** (fixed).  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, U, P, T, F, S, H (cannot appear in the word).  
- **E is confirmed once** (no duplicates, based on feedback consistency).  
- **Remaining possible letters**: B, D, G, I, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We need to guess a 5-letter word fitting `_ R _ E _` using only the remaining letters.  
- Prioritize common letters (e.g., D, L, O, I, W) to test multiple possibilities.  
- **Candidate words** that fit the pattern and constraints:  
  - **ORIEL** (O, R, I, E, L): Tests O, I, L.  
  - **DRIED** (D, R, I, E, D): Tests D, I (repeated D).  
  - **WRIED** (W, R, I, E, D): Tests W, I, D.  
- **Why choose ORIEL?**  
  - Tests **three new letters** (O, I, L) without repetition.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on O/I/L will help differentiate between remaining candidates (e.g., DRIED or WRIED).  
  - Efficient for narrowing possibilities with one guess.  

### Next Guess: ORIEL  
- **Pattern**: `O R I E L`  
  - Tests position 1: **O**  
  - Tests position 3: **I**  
  - Tests position 5: **L**

We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, D is new.\n  - However, we have to avoid the excluded letters. BREED: B, D are new and allowed.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. The feedback from the first guess only showed one E, but it could have more. Similarly, the second guess had only one E and it was marked present.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word with E in the fourth position: _ R _ E _\n\nExamples:\n  - GRUEL: but U is excluded (from guess 2: U is not in the word).\n  - FREED: F R E E D -> again, two E\'s? And we have F and D.\n\nBut we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother idea: since we have only two possible positions for E, we can choose a word that puts E in the third position and then if it\'s not there, we know it must be in the fourth. But we also want to test other letters.\n\nLet me try to list some words:\n\nFor E in the third position:\n  - BREW? -> 4 letters, too short.\n  - BRED? -> 4 letters.\n  - 5-letter words: \n      - BREAD -> but A is excluded.\n      - DREAD -> A excluded.\n      - FREED -> F R E E D (has two E\'s, but we don\'t mind testing)\n      - GREET -> G R E E T -> but T is excluded (from guess 2: T is not in the word).\n      - CREEP -> C excluded.\n      - PREEN -> P excluded.\n\nSo with E in the third, we have limited options because many common words have excluded letters.\n\nWhat about: \n  - BREME? Not a common word.\n  - BRERE? Not a word.\n\nHow about: \n  - BRIDE -> but I and D. However, we haven\'t excluded I and D. But note: in the first guess, we had E at the end and it was present but not at the end, so the word has an E. But in BRIDE, E is at the end. We cannot put E at the end because we know it\'s not at the end. So we must avoid E at the end.\n\nTherefore, for E in the third position, the fifth letter must not be E. Similarly, for E in the fourth position, the fifth letter must not be E.\n\nSo for E in the third: _ R E _ X (where X is not E and not excluded)\n\nExamples:\n  - BREWS? 5 letters? BREWS is 5 letters: B R E W S -> but W and S are new. And E in third.\n\nBut is BREWS a word? Yes, meaning of a type of beer? But let\'s check: it\'s a valid word.\n\n  - Alternatively, BRENS? But N is excluded.\n\n  - DRESS: D R E S S -> but we have two S\'s? And E in third. But S is new. However, we have to avoid T, but T is excluded so we are safe.\n\n  - But note: in the first guess, we had E at the fifth and it was present but not there, so the secret word has an E. In DRESS, we have E at the third and S at the fourth and fifth. We don\'t know if the secret word has S.\n\n  - Another: FRESH -> F R E S H -> H is new. And avoids excluded letters.\n\n  - Or: WRECK -> but C and K? C is excluded, so no.\n\n  - BLESS -> B L E S S -> but L is in position 2? We need R in position 2. So no.\n\n  - So we need R in position 2.\n\nNow, for E in the fourth position: _ R _ E _\n  Examples:\n    - GRACE -> but C and A excluded.\n    - PRICE -> P and C excluded.\n    - TRIPE -> T and P excluded.\n    - DRIVE -> D R I V E -> but E at the end? We cannot have E at the end. So we must avoid that.\n\n  - So the fifth letter must not be E. Therefore, we need a word like: _ R _ E X (where X is not E and not excluded)\n\n  - Examples: \n      - GRUEL -> but U excluded.\n      - GROVE -> but we have E at the end? No, GROVE has E at the end? G R O V E -> E at the fifth, which is not allowed. So avoid.\n\n  - How about: BRUTE -> but U and T excluded.\n\n  - CRONE -> C excluded.\n\n  - DRONE -> D R O N E -> but N excluded and E at the end.\n\n  - So we need a word that has a non-E at the end and E in the fourth.\n\n  - Examples: \n      - BRIDE -> but E at the end, so no.\n      - BRINE -> N excluded and E at the end.\n\n  - How about: TRADE -> T and A excluded.\n\n  - SHIRE -> S H I R E -> but R is in position 4? We need R in position 2. So no.\n\n  - We need R in position 2: so the pattern is: _ R ? E ?\n\n  - Let me think: ORATE? O R A T E -> but A and T excluded, and E at the end.\n\n  - Another: WRITE -> W R I T E -> T excluded and E at the end.\n\n  - So it\'s hard to find a word with E in the fourth and not at the end without excluded letters.\n\nGiven the difficulty, let\'s try to focus on E in the third position.\n\nWe have:\n  Position: 1: ?, 2: R, 3: E, 4: ?, 5: ? (and ? cannot be E and not excluded)\n\nWe have to choose letters for positions 1,4,5 from: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to test common letters to maximize information.\n\nPossible words:\n  - BREED: B R E E D -> but has two E\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has two E\'s. Also, we are testing E in the third, but if the secret word has only one E and we put two, we might get confusing feedback. However, it\'s acceptable because if the secret word has only one E, then one of the E\'s in BREED will be marked as absent? But wait, the feedback marks each letter individually. Actually, if the secret word has only one E, then the first E (in position 3) would be marked as present (if it is the correct one) and the second E (in position 4) would be marked as absent? But that might not be efficient.\n\n  - Instead, let\'s avoid multiple E\'s for now.\n\n  - How about: BRICK -> but C excluded.\n\n  - BRISK: B R I S K -> no E? But we must include E because we know E is in the word. So we cannot skip E.\n\n  - We must include E in the third position.\n\n  - So: _ R E _ _\n\n  Words without repeating E and without excluded letters:\n\n    - BREWS: B R E W S -> valid word. Letters: B, W, S are new.\n    - DRESS: D R E S S -> has two S\'s, but that\'s okay. Letters: D, S.\n    - FRESH: F R E S H -> letters: F, S, H.\n    - GRESS? Not a word.\n    - PRESS: P excluded.\n    - TRESS: T excluded.\n    - BREDE? Not common.\n    - BRERE? Not a word.\n    - BREME? Not common.\n\n  - Another: DREGS: D R E G S -> avoids excluded letters. And G and S are new.\n\n  - Or: GREWS? Not a word.\n\n  - So we have: BREWS, DRESS, FRESH, DREGS.\n\n  - Let\'s choose one that tests more common consonants.\n\n  - I think ""FRESH"" is a good candidate: it has F, S, H which are common.\n\n  - But note: we are putting E in the third position. If the secret word has E in the fourth, then this guess will show that E is not in the third, so we will know it must be in the fourth.\n\n  - Alternatively, we could choose a word that has E in the fourth position to test that.\n\nBut since we are having trouble finding a word with E in the fourth without excluded letters, let\'s go with E in the third.\n\nI choose ""FRESH"": F R E S H.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm: \n  F (position 1): new\n  R (position 2): correct\n  E (position 3): we are testing if E is here\n  S (position 4): new\n  H (position 5): new\n\nThis tests three new letters and checks the position of E.\n\nIf the feedback shows that E is not in the third position (i.e., marked as absent or wrong position) then we know E must be in the fourth position.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""FRESH"".\n\nBut note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""FRESH"" is a valid 5-letter word.\n\nTherefore, the third guess is ""FRESH"".\n\n<guess>fresh</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **R** is confirmed in the second position.\n- **E** is present but **not in positions 1, 2, or 5**, so it must be in position 3 or 4.\n- Letters **C, A, N, U, P, T** are absent from the secret word.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **R** in the second position.\n- Must include **E** (tested in position 3 to narrow down its location).\n- Avoids excluded letters (**C, A, N, U, P, T**).\n- Tests new common letters (e.g., **F, S, H**).\n\n**FRESH** fits these criteria:\n- **F** (new) in position 1.\n- **R** (✓) in position 2.\n- **E** (tested in position 3).\n- **S** (new) in position 4.\n- **H** (new) in position 5.\n\nThis guess will help identify if **E** is in position 3 and provide information about other letters.\n\n<guess>fresh</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: erupt -> FEEDBACK: E(-) R(✓) U(x) P(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: fresh -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) E(-) S(x) H(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in word)\n  R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)\n  A: x (not in word)\n  N: x (not in word)\n  E: - (in word, wrong position; so E is in the word but not at position 5)\n\nGuess 2: ""erupt""\n  E: - (in word, wrong position; so E is not at position 1 or 5, and we already know not at 2, so E must be at 3 or 4)\n  R: ✓ (correct, position 2)\n  U: x (not in word)\n  P: x (not in word)\n  T: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 3: ""fresh""\n  F: x (not in word)\n  R: ✓ (correct, position 2)\n  E: - (in word, wrong position; but we put E at position 3, so this means E is not at position 3. Therefore, E must be at position 4, since the only remaining possibility is position 4)\n  S: x (not in word)\n  H: x (not in word)\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word has the second letter R and the fourth letter E (because E must be at position 4, as we just deduced).\n- The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, U, P, T, F, S, H.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we know E is in the word and not at position 5, and now we know it\'s at position 4.\n\nTherefore, the secret word pattern is: _ R _ E _\n\nWe need to fill in the first, third, and fifth positions.\n\nThe missing letters must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the known absent letters: C, A, N, U, P, T, F, S, H.\n\nRemaining letters: B, D, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe also know that the word has exactly these letters: one in position 1, one in position 3, one in position 5, and we have R in 2 and E in 4.\n\nNow, we need to make a guess that fits this pattern and uses only the remaining letters.\n\nWe should try to cover as many common letters as possible to narrow down.\n\nThe pattern: [letter1] R [letter3] E [letter5]\n\nWe can try to think of common words that fit this pattern.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the excluded letters.\n\nLet\'s list some words that match _ R _ E _:\n\n- GRADE: but A is excluded.\n- GRAPE: A and P excluded.\n- GRIEF: but F excluded.\n- BRIEF: B R I E F -> F is excluded.\n- DRIVE: D R I V E -> but E is at the end? No, in our pattern, E is at position 4, so the word would be D R I V E, which has E at position 4? Let\'s count:\n  D (1), R (2), I (3), V (4), E (5) -> no, that\'s not our pattern. Our pattern has E at position 4, so the fifth letter is after E.\n\nThe pattern is: position 1: ?, 2: R, 3: ?, 4: E, 5: ?\n\nSo for ""DRIVE"": \n  D (1), R (2), I (3), V (4), E (5) -> but that would be pattern _ R _ _ E, not _ R _ E _.\n\nWe need E at position 4, so the word should be: ? R ? E ?\n\nExamples:\n  - ORBED: O R B E D -> but D is allowed? Let\'s check: O, B, D are not excluded. \n  - However, we have to see if it\'s a valid word. ""ORBED"" means having the form of an orb; spherical. It\'s a valid word.\n\n  - Other words:\n    - ARBOR: but A excluded.\n    - ARMOR: A excluded.\n    - BROKE: B R O K E -> but E is at the end? Pattern: B(1), R(2), O(3), K(4), E(5) -> not matching because we need E at 4, but here E is at 5 and K is at 4.\n\n  - We need the fourth letter to be E, so the fifth letter is something else.\n\n  - How about: BRIDE: B R I D E -> but E is at the end? Pattern: B(1), R(2), I(3), D(4), E(5) -> again, E at 5, not at 4.\n\n  - Correct pattern: the fourth letter is E, so the word has the form: ... E at the fourth position.\n\n  - Example: TRUE: too short.\n\n  - 5-letter words: \n      - GREBE: G R E B E -> but E is at position 3 and 5, not at 4. And we have E at 3? But we know E is at 4. So no.\n\n  - Another: PROBE: P R O B E -> P excluded and E at the end.\n\n  - How about: CRWTH? Not common and C excluded.\n\n  - Let me search: \n      - WRITE: W R I T E -> T excluded and E at the end.\n\n  - We need the fourth letter to be E: so the word must have the letter E in the fourth position.\n\n  - Examples: \n      - OGRES: O G R E S -> but R is at position 3? We need R at position 2. So no.\n\n  - We must have R at position 2 and E at position 4.\n\n  - So: \n      - Position 1: any letter (not excluded)\n      - Position 2: R\n      - Position 3: any letter (not excluded)\n      - Position 4: E\n      - Position 5: any letter (not excluded)\n\n  - Words: \n      - BREDE? Not common.\n      - BREME? Not common.\n      - BRERE? Not a word.\n      - DREED? D R E E D -> but E at position 3 and 4? We have E at 4, but then position 3 is E? That would be two E\'s. But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. However, in the first guess, we had only one E and it was marked present. But it could have more. Similarly, in the second and third guesses, we only had one E and it was marked present. So it might have only one E? But we are putting E at position 4, so if we put E at position 3 as well, that would be two.\n\n  - But note: the feedback for ""fresh"" had E at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn\'t necessarily mean there is only one E. It could be that there is an E at position 4 and also one at position 3? But then the feedback would mark the E at position 3 as correct if it were in the word? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one E, and we put two E\'s, then one of them (the one in the correct position) would be marked as correct, and the other might be marked as absent? But in our case, for ""fresh"", we had E at position 3 and it was marked as present (the \'-\' meaning in the word but wrong position). That means that the secret word has an E, but not at position 3. So if the secret word had two E\'s, one at position 3 and one at position 4, then when we put E at position 3, it would be marked as correct (a check) because it\'s in the right position. But in the feedback, it was marked as \'-\' (wrong position), meaning that the E at position 3 is not correct, so the secret word does not have an E at position 3. Therefore, the secret word has exactly one E, and it is at position 4.\n\n  - So we must not put E in any other position. Therefore, in our guess, we should not use E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5. Only position 4 is E.\n\n  - Therefore, the word must be: [letter1] R [letter3] E [letter5] with letter1, letter3, letter5 not being E and not being any of the excluded letters.\n\n  - Now, we need to find such words.\n\n  - Let me think of common words: \n      - GRADE: A excluded.\n      - GRIME: G R I M E -> but E is at the end? Pattern: G(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), E(5) -> no, we need E at 4, but here M is at 4 and E at 5.\n\n  - We need the fourth letter to be E, so the word ends with E at the fourth and then a fifth letter.\n\n  - Example: \n      - ARISE: A excluded.\n      - BRINE: N excluded.\n      - TRICE: T and C excluded.\n      - ORIEL: O R I E L -> but E is at position 4? Let\'s see: O(1), R(2), I(3), E(4), L(5). Yes! And O, I, L are not excluded.\n\n  - Is ""ORIEL"" a word? Yes, it means a type of bay window or a gallery. Valid.\n\n  - Another: DRIED: D R I E D -> but E is at position 4? D(1), R(2), I(3), E(4), D(5). Yes. And D and I are allowed.\n\n  - But note: we have two D\'s? That\'s okay.\n\n  - Another: FRIED: F excluded.\n\n  - GRIEF: F excluded.\n\n  - PRIED: P excluded.\n\n  - TRIED: T excluded.\n\n  - So we have ""ORIEL"" and ""DRIED"".\n\n  - Also: BRIBE: B R I B E -> but E at the end? Pattern: B(1), R(2), I(3), B(4), E(5) -> no, E at 5.\n\n  - How about: BRIDE: B R I D E -> E at 5.\n\n  - Another: WRECK: W R E C K -> but C excluded and E at 3? We need E at 4.\n\n  - Let me try: CREDO? C excluded.\n\n  - So back to ""ORIEL"" and ""DRIED"".\n\n  - Also: ""BROKE"" -> E at 5.\n\n  - ""GROVE"" -> E at 5.\n\n  - ""TROVE"" -> T excluded.\n\n  - ""DROVE"" -> same.\n\n  - How about: ""GRUEL"" -> U excluded.\n\n  - ""GRAIL"" -> A excluded.\n\n  - ""TRAIL"" -> T and A excluded.\n\n  - ""DRAWL"" -> A excluded? D R A W L -> A excluded.\n\n  - ""GROWL"" -> G R O W L -> no E? We don\'t have E at position 4.\n\n  - We must have E at position 4.\n\n  - Another word: ""CREEL"" -> C excluded.\n\n  - ""KREEP""? Not a word.\n\n  - ""BREED"" -> E at 3 and 4? But we cannot have two E\'s? And we are not supposed to put E in position 3 because we know the secret word has only one E and it\'s at 4. So if we put E at 3, it would be incorrect and marked as absent? But we want to avoid that to save guesses.\n\n  - So we should avoid using E in positions other than 4.\n\n  - Therefore, let\'s consider ""ORIEL"" and ""DRIED"".\n\n  - Also: ""BRIES""? Not common.\n\n  - ""DRIES"": D R I E S -> but S is excluded (from guess 3: S is not in the word).\n\n  - ""DRIED"": D R I E D -> S is not in this, and D and I are allowed.\n\n  - ""ORIEL"": O R I E L -> O, I, L are allowed.\n\n  - Another: ""CRIBS"" -> C excluded.\n\n  - ""BROIL"": B R O I L -> no E? We need E at position 4.\n\n  - So we must have E at 4.\n\n  - How about: ""OWRIE""? Not a word.\n\n  - ""ARIEL"": A excluded.\n\n  - ""BRIBE"": E at the end.\n\n  - I think ""ORIEL"" and ""DRIED"" are the main options.\n\n  - Also: ""GRILL"" -> no E.\n\n  - ""DROLL"" -> no E.\n\n  - ""TROLL"" -> T excluded.\n\n  - ""WRIED"": W R I E D -> W, R, I, E, D. Pattern: W(1), R(2), I(3), E(4), D(5). Yes! And W, I, D are not excluded.\n\n  - ""WRIED"" is a word? It is the past tense of wry. Valid.\n\n  - So we have: ORIEL, DRIED, WRIED.\n\n  - We can choose one that uses more common letters or letters we haven\'t tried.\n\n  - We haven\'t tried: B, D, G, I, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n  - Among these, D, I, O, L, W are common.\n\n  - ""ORIEL"" uses O, I, L.\n  - ""DRIED"" uses D, I (and repeats D).\n  - ""WRIED"" uses W, I, D.\n\n  - Since we have limited guesses left (we are on the fourth guess, and we have 6 total), we want to maximize information.\n\n  - But note: we are also trying to guess the word. We might be able to guess it.\n\n  - Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests multiple possibilities.\n\n  - However, we know the pattern is _ R _ E _ and we have three positions to fill. We can try to cover several common letters.\n\n  - But we have only one guess left? No, we have three more guesses (since we are about to make the fourth guess, and we have 6 total).\n\n  - We can try to use a word that has letters that appear in many possible words.\n\n  - But the list of possible words is small. Let\'s list all possible words that fit the pattern and use only the allowed letters.\n\n  - Allowed letters: B, D, G, I, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n  - Words:\n      - ORIEL: O, R, I, E, L\n      - DRIED: D, R, I, E, D (but note: two D\'s? The secret word might have two D\'s? But we don\'t know. However, in the feedback so far, we haven\'t seen any repeated letters, but it\'s possible.)\n      - WRIED: W, R, I, E, D\n      - Also: BRIED? Not a word.\n      - GRILL: no E.\n      - DROVE: D R O V E -> but E at the end? No, we need E at 4. D(1), R(2), O(3), V(4), E(5) -> no.\n      - GROVE: same.\n      - How about: ""DROLE""? Not common, and no E at 4.\n      - ""DRERE""? Not a word.\n      - ""DREYE""? Not a word.\n      - ""ORFE""? Not 5 letters.\n      - ""ORZES""? O R Z E S -> but S excluded.\n      - ""BROME"": B R O M E -> E at the end? No.\n      - ""GRIDE"": G R I D E -> E at the end? Pattern: G(1), R(2), I(3), D(4), E(5) -> no.\n      - ""GRISE"": G R I S E -> S excluded and E at the end.\n      - ""KRONE"": K R O N E -> N excluded.\n      - ""VROOM"": no E.\n      - ""WRITE"": T excluded.\n      - ""WROKE"": W R O K E -> E at the end.\n      - ""WRIED"" is valid.\n\n  - Another: ""DROID"" -> no E.\n\n  - ""DROIL"" -> no E.\n\n  - ""DROLE"" -> no E.\n\n  - ""DROME"" -> E at the end.\n\n  - So the only words I can think of are: ORIEL, DRIED, WRIED.\n\n  - Also: ""BRIZE""? Not common.\n\n  - ""ORIBI""? Not a word? Oribi is an animal, but it\'s 5 letters: O R I B I -> but no E?

We have the new feedback for Guess 4: ""oriel""
  O: x (not in the word)
  R: ✓ (correct position)
  I: ✓ (correct position, so I is the third letter)
  E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fourth letter, which we knew)
  L: x (not in the word)

Therefore, from guess 4:
  The secret word has: second letter R, third letter I, fourth letter E.
  And O and L are not in the word.

We already knew that the secret word has R at position 2 and E at position 4. Now we know that position 3 is I.

So the secret word is: _ R I E _ 

We only need to find the first and fifth letters.

We also know from previous feedback the absent letters: C, A, N, U, P, T, F, S, H, O, L.

Remaining allowable letters: B, D, G, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others not excluded).

We must not use the excluded letters.

Possible words that fit the pattern _ R I E _:

We need to fill position 1 and position 5 with letters not excluded.

Excluded letters: A, C, F, H, L, N, O, P, S, T, U (and also from guess 2: U,P,T; guess 3: F,S,H; guess 4: O,L). So the full excluded set: A, C, F, H, L, N, O, P, S, T, U.

Allowed letters: B, D, G, I, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note: I is already used in position 3, but it could be repeated? We don't know. However, we haven't seen any indication of repeated letters, but it's possible. But we are not forced to avoid I elsewhere.

But in this pattern, we only have two positions: 1 and 5.

Common words that fit _ R I E _:

- BRIEF: B R I E F -> but F is excluded.
- CRIED: C excluded.
- FRIED: F excluded.
- PRIED: P excluded.
- TRIED: T excluded.
- DRIED: D R I E D -> both positions: D at 1 and D at 5? This is a valid word. And D is allowed (not excluded).
- Also: BRIER? B R I E R -> but R at the end? Pattern: B(1), R(2), I(3), E(4), R(5). And R is not excluded? But we haven't excluded R, but R is already in the word at position 2. Could the word have two R's? Yes.
- But note: the feedback from previous guesses never showed R more than once, but it's possible.

Now, let's check DRIED: 
  Position 1: D
  Position 5: D

Is D allowed? Yes, because it hasn't been excluded.

Similarly, BRIER: 
  Position 1: B
  Position 5: R

B and R are allowed? R is allowed, but we know R is in the word at position 2. The presence of another R is possible.

But note: the feedback for ""erupt"" had R at position 2 marked correct and no other R's? We didn't have any R in other positions in the guesses? In ""erupt"", we had R at position 2, and no other R. Similarly, in other guesses.

However, if the secret word is ""BRIER"", then it has R at position 2 and 5. In the guess ""crane"", we didn't have R at position 5? We had R only at position 2. Similarly, in other guesses.

But we haven't tested a word with R at position 5, so we don't know.

Another word: WRIED: W R I E D -> W at 1, D at 5. Both allowed.

Also: GRIBE? Not common.

Therefore, the possible words are DRIED, BRIER, WRIED.

Also: KRILL? But K R I L L -> L excluded? And L is excluded (from guess 4).

KRIES? Not common.

DRIES? But S excluded.

So we have:
1. DRIED: D R I E D
2. WRIED: W R I E D
3. BRIER: B R I E R

Now, we need to choose among these three for the fifth guess? But we have two guesses left (since we are making the fifth now).

We could guess one of these.

Alternatively, we could try to eliminate multiple possibilities with a guess that tests the first and fifth positions.

But note: we only have two positions unknown, and five valid letters: B, D, W, and we also have G, K, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z which might be possible? But are there other words?

For example:
  GRIE? No.
  MRIED? Not a word.
  QRIED? Not a word.
  VRIED? Not a word.
  ZRIED? Not a word.

So probably only DRIED, WRIED, BRIER.

And note: BRIER has two R's. We haven't tested a word with a second R? So we don't know if R appears again.

Similarly, DRIED and WRIED have D in common: DRIED has two D's? Position 1 and 5 are D? So two D's? And WRIED has D only at the end.

We can try to test a word that uses a letter common to these but we don't have time? Since we can guess one.

But let's consider:

If we guess ""DRIED"":
  If it's correct, we win.
  If not, then the secret word must be either WRIED or BRIER.

Similarly, if we guess ""WRIED"", then if wrong, it's DRIED or BRIER.

So we might as well guess ""DRIED"" because it uses D, and we haven't tested D? Actually, we haven't tested D anywhere.

But note: we have only three possibilities. We are on the fifth guess, and we have two guesses left. So we can guess.

I suggest we guess ""DRIED"" because it is a common word.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests the presence of D? But we don't have many guesses.

Another idea: guess a word that has B and D? But we don't know any word that fits the pattern and has B and D? Not possible.

So we'll guess ""DRIED"".

### Analysis of All Feedback:

1. **Guess 1: CRANE**  
   - Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
   - **Insights**:  
     - R is **fixed at position 2**.  
     - E is present in the word but **not at position 5**.  
     - C, A, N are **absent**.  

2. **Guess 2: ERUPT**  
   - Feedback: E(-), R(✓), U(x), P(x), T(x)  
   - **Insights**:  
     - E is **not at position 1**.

     - F, S, H are **absent**.  

4. **Guess 4: ORIEL**  
   - Feedback: O(x), R(✓), I(✓), E(✓), L(x)  
   - **Insights**:  
     - I is **fixed at position 3**.  
     - E is confirmed at **position 4** (already known).  
     - O and L are **absent**.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ R I E _`  
  - Positions:  
    - 2: R  
    - 3: I  
    - 4: E  
  - Missing: Positions 1 and 5.  
- **Absent letters**: A, C, F, H, L, N, O, P, S, T, U.  
- **Remaining possible letters**: B, D, G, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (no constraints from repeated letters yet).  
- **Possible words** fitting `_ R I E _` (from common English words):  
  - **DRIED** (D at 1, D at 5)  
  - **WRIED** (W at 1, D at 5)  
  - **BRIER** (B at 1, R at 5)  

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- Prioritize **DRIED** as a guess because:  
  - It tests the highly common letter **D** in positions 1 and 5.  
  - If correct, it wins; if incorrect, the feedback will distinguish between **WRIED** (W/D) and **BRIER** (B/R).  
- **WRIED** is less common than **DRIED**, and **BRIER** introduces a second R (unverified).  
- This maximizes information with one guess while leveraging common letter frequencies.  

### Next Guess: DRIED  
- **Pattern**: `D R I E D`  
  - Tests **D** at positions 1 and 5.  
  - If feedback confirms both positions, it solves the word. If not, the last guess can choose between **WRIED** or **BRIER** based on feedback.

Allowed letters: B, D, G, I, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note: I is already used in position 3, but it could be repeated? We don't know. However, we haven't seen any indication of repeated letters, but it's possible. But we are not forced to avoid I elsewhere.
