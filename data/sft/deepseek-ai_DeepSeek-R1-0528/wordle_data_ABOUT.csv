We are making the first guess. Since we have no previous feedback, we want a word that maximizes information.
 A good starting word should have distinct letters and common letters to help narrow down possibilities.
 Common vowels and consonants are often used. Words like ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"" are popular starters.
 Let's choose ""CRATE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, T, E and all distinct.

 So the first guess will be ""CRATE"".

I'm making the first guess with no prior feedback. For initial guesses in Wordle, it's strategic to use words with common distinct letters (especially vowels and frequent consonants) to maximize information gain. ""CRATE"" is an optimal starting word because:
- Contains three vowels (A and E) and common consonants (C, R, T)
- All letters are distinct, allowing us to test five unique characters at once
- Frequently used in Wordle strategy for balanced letter coverage 

This should provide strong initial feedback about letter presence/absence and positioning.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRATE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- T: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and T, but not in the positions they were in ""CRATE"". In ""CRATE"", A was in position 3 and T was in position 4. So A cannot be in position 3, and T cannot be in position 4.
- The letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Includes A and T (since they are in the word) but in different positions than in the first guess.
- Avoids the letters C, R, E because they are not in the word.
- Tries to include other common letters to get more information.

Since A and T are present, we should place them in new positions. In the first guess, A was at position 3 and T at position 4. So for the second guess, we can try A in positions 1,2,4,5 and T in positions 1,2,3,5.

We also want to use other common letters that haven't been tested yet. Since C, R, E are out, we can try letters like S, I, O, L, N, D, etc.

Let's think of words that have A and T, and avoid C, R, E.

Possible words: 
- We can try to put A at the beginning? But note: we don't know if A can be at position 1. Similarly for T.

One common word is ""PAINT"", but it has T at the end (position 5) and A at position 2. However, we haven't tested P, I, N.

But note: we must avoid R and E, so ""PAINT"" is okay? Let's check: P, A, I, N, T. None of these are C, R, E. So it's acceptable.

But we also have to consider that in the first guess, A was at position 3 and T at position 4. Now in ""PAINT"", A is at position 2 and T at position 5. Both are new positions.

Alternatively, we could try ""SAINT"", which has S, A, I, N, T. S is a common letter.

Another option: ""TRAIN"" but wait, it has R which we know is not in the word. So we must avoid R. Therefore, ""TRAIN"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""PLANT"" has L, A, N, T. But we don't know about P, L, N.

We want to maximize new letters. So let's list the letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we know C, R, E are out.

We have tested: C, R, A, T, E. So we have 5 letters tested: A and T are in the word; C, R, E are not.

We need to test more letters. So a word with A and T and three new letters.

Let me try to form a word: 
- How about ""SALTY""? It has S, A, L, T, Y. 
  - A is at position 2 (was 3 in first guess, so new)
  - T is at position 4 (was 4 in first guess? Wait, in first guess T was at position 4 and we got T(-) meaning it is in the word but not at position 4. So in the second guess, we must not put T at position 4 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So better to put T in a different position.

In ""SALTY"", T is at position 4, which is the same as the first guess. We know T is not at position 4, so putting T at position 4 again would be a waste. We should avoid that.

So let's avoid position 4 for T.

Similarly, for A, we know it's not at position 3, so we should avoid position 3 for A.

Therefore, in the second guess, we should put A in a position that is not 3, and T in a position that is not 4.

Possible positions for A: 1,2,4,5
For T: 1,2,3,5

Now, let's think of words that have A and T in these positions and avoid C,R,E.

Option 1: A at position 1, T at position 5: e.g., ""ABOUT"" -> but has O, U, B. But also, we can use. However, ""ABOUT"" has B, O, U, T. But we don't know about these.

But note: we have A at 1 and T at 5. Also, we avoid C,R,E.

Option 2: A at position 2, T at position 3: e.g., ""PATIO"" -> but has P, T, I, O. And A at 2, T at 3? Actually, ""PATIO"" is P-A-T-I-O: so A at 2, T at 3. But we don't know if T can be at 3? We haven't tested that.

But we must avoid R and E, so ""PATIO"" is okay.

However, we have to consider that we are limited to 5-letter words.

Another option: ""PASTA"" -> P-A-S-T-A. But has two A's? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But in the feedback, we only know that A is present at least once. So ""PASTA"" is a valid word, but it has A at position 2 and 5, and T at position 4. But we know T is not at position 4 (from first guess), so putting T at 4 again is not good. So avoid.

Better: ""PAINT"" as I thought earlier: P-A-I-N-T -> A at position 2, T at position 5. Both are new positions (A was 3, now 2; T was 4, now 5). And letters: P, A, I, N, T. All new except A and T.

Similarly, ""SAINT"": S-A-I-N-T -> A at 2, T at 5.

Or ""TASTY"": T-A-S-T-Y -> but T at position 1 and 4? We know T is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. Also, T at position 4: we know T is not at position 4, so that would be a waste. And A at position 2.

But in ""TASTY"", the first T is at position 1, which is a new position, and the second T at 4 is known to be wrong. So we would get feedback for the first T and the second T. But it might be inefficient because we already know T is not at 4.

So better to avoid known wrong positions.

Therefore, ""SAINT"" or ""PAINT"" are good.

Another word: ""DAILY"" but no T. We must include T and A.

We must include both A and T because they are in the word.

So let's choose between ""SAINT"" and ""PAINT"". Both are common words.

I think ""SAINT"" is a good choice because S is a very common letter.

So second guess: ""SAINT""

But let's double-check the positions:
- S at 1
- A at 2 (was 3 in first guess, so new)
- I at 3
- N at 4
- T at 5 (was 4 in first guess, now 5, so new)

This should be a good guess.

We might also consider ""PAINT"", but S is more common than P? Actually, both are fine.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has A and T and also tests other common vowels or consonants. But we have already tested A and E (E is out), so vowels: we know A is in, E is out. So we can test I, O, U.

In ""SAINT"", we test I and also S and N.

So I think ""SAINT"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, the second guess is ""SAINT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"":
- **C, R, E** are **not** in the word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").
- **T** is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked ""-"").

### Key Insights:
1. The secret word contains **A** and **T**, but they must be placed in new positions:
   - **A** cannot be in position 3 (so it must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5).
   - **T** cannot be in position 4 (so it must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5).
2. Avoid **C, R, E** entirely in future guesses.
3. To maximize information, the new guess should:
   - Include **A** and **T** in untested positions.
   - Introduce new common letters (e.g., S, I, N, L, O) to test their presence/absence.
   - Prioritize words with distinct letters to cover more ground.

### Why ""SAINT""?
- **A** is placed in position 2 (new position, not 3).
- **T** is placed in position 5 (new position, not 4).
- Uses new common letters: **S** (position 1), **I** (position 3), **N** (position 4).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, E).
- Tests high-frequency consonants (S, N) and a vowel (I), which could quickly reveal more about the secret word.

<guess>SAINT</guess>",SAINT,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRATE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)

- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and T, but not in the positions they were in ""CRATE"". In ""CRATE"", A was in position 3 and T was in position 4. So A cannot be in position 3, and T cannot be in position 4.

We want to maximize new letters. So let's list the letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we know C, R, E are out.

We have tested: C, R, A, T, E. So we have 5 letters tested: A and T are in the word; C, R, E are not.

We need to test more letters. So a word with A and T and three new letters.

Let me try to form a word: 
- How about ""SALTY""? It has S, A, L, T, Y. 
  - A is at position 2 (was 3 in first guess, so new)
  - T is at position 4 (was 4 in first guess? Wait, in first guess T was at position 4 and we got T(-) meaning it is in the word but not at position 4. So in the second guess, we must not put T at position 4 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So better to put T in a different position.

In ""SALTY"", T is at position 4, which is the same as the first guess. We know T is not at position 4, so putting T at position 4 again would be a waste. We should avoid that.

So let's avoid position 4 for T.

Similarly, for A, we know it's not at position 3, so we should avoid position 3 for A.

Therefore, in the second guess, we should put A in a position that is not 3, and T in a position that is not 4.

Possible positions for A: 1,2,4,5
For T: 1,2,3,5

Now, let's think of words that have A and T in these positions and avoid C,R,E.

Option 1: A at position 1, T at position 5: e.g., ""ABOUT"" -> but has O, U, B. But also, we can use. However, ""ABOUT"" has B, O, U, T. But we don't know about these.

But note: we have A at 1 and T at 5. Also, we avoid C,R,E.

Option 2: A at position 2, T at position 3: e.g., ""PATIO"" -> but has P, T, I, O. And A at 2, T at 3? Actually, ""PATIO"" is P-A-T-I-O: so A at 2, T at 3. But we don't know if T can be at 3? We haven't tested that.

But we must avoid R and E, so ""PATIO"" is okay.

However, we have to consider that we are limited to 5-letter words.

Another option: ""PASTA"" -> P-A-S-T-A. But has two A's? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But in the feedback, we only know that A is present at least once. So ""PASTA"" is a valid word, but it has A at position 2 and 5, and T at position 4. But we know T is not at position 4 (from first guess), so putting T at 4 again is not good. So avoid.

Better: ""PAINT"" as I thought earlier: P-A-I-N-T -> A at position 2, T at position 5. Both are new positions (A was 3, now 2; T was 4, now 5). And letters: P, A, I, N, T. All new except A and T.

Similarly, ""SAINT"": S-A-I-N-T -> A at 2, T at 5.

Or ""TASTY"": T-A-S-T-Y -> but T at position 1 and 4? We know T is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. Also, T at position 4: we know T is not at position 4, so that would be a waste. And A at position 2.

So better to avoid known wrong positions.

Therefore, ""SAINT"" or ""PAINT"" are good.

Another word: ""DAILY"" but no T. We must include T and A.

We must include both A and T because they are in the word.

So let's choose between ""SAINT"" and ""PAINT"". Both are common words.

I think ""SAINT"" is a good choice because S is a very common letter.

So second guess: ""SAINT""

But let's double-check the positions:
- S at 1
- A at 2 (was 3 in first guess, so new)
- I at 3
- N at 4
- T at 5 (was 4 in first guess, now 5, so new)

This should be a good guess.

We might also consider ""PAINT"", but S is more common than P? Actually, both are fine.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has A and T and also tests other common vowels or consonants. But we have already tested A and E (E is out), so vowels: we know A is in, E is out. So we can test I, O, U.

In ""SAINT"", we test I and also S and N.

- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Includes A and T (since they are in the word) but in different positions than in the first guess.
- Avoids the letters C, R, E because they are not in the word.
- Tries to include other common letters to get more information.

Since A and T are present, we should place them in new positions. In the first guess, A was at position 3 and T at position 4. So for the second guess, we can try A in positions 1,2,4,5 and T in positions 1,2,3,5.

We also want to use other common letters that haven't been tested yet. Since C, R, E are out, we can try letters like S, I, O, L, N, D, etc.

Let's think of words that have A and T, and avoid C, R, E.

Possible words: 
- We can try to put A at the beginning? But note: we don't know if A can be at position 1. Similarly for T.

One common word is ""PAINT"", but it has T at the end (position 5) and A at position 2. However, we haven't tested P, I, N.

But note: we must avoid R and E, so ""PAINT"" is okay? Let's check: P, A, I, N, T. None of these are C, R, E. So it's acceptable.

But we also have to consider that in the first guess, A was at position 3 and T at position 4. Now in ""PAINT"", A is at position 2 and T at position 5. Both are new positions.

Alternatively, we could try ""SAINT"", which has S, A, I, N, T. S is a common letter.

Another option: ""TRAIN"" but wait, it has R which we know is not in the word. So we must avoid R. Therefore, ""TRAIN"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""PLANT"" has L, A, N, T. But we don't know about P, L, N.

We want to maximize new letters. So let's list the letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we know C, R, E are out.

We have tested: C, R, A, T, E. So we have 5 letters tested: A and T are in the word; C, R, E are not.

We need to test more letters. So a word with A and T and three new letters.

Let me try to form a word: 
- How about ""SALTY""? It has S, A, L, T, Y. 
  - A is at position 2 (was 3 in first guess, so new)
  - T is at position 4 (was 4 in first guess? Wait, in first guess T was at position 4 and we got T(-) meaning it is in the word but not at position 4. So in the second guess, we must not put T at position 4 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So better to put T in a different position.

In ""SALTY"", T is at position 4, which is the same as the first guess. We know T is not at position 4, so putting T at position 4 again would be a waste. We should avoid that.

So let's avoid position 4 for T.

Similarly, for A, we know it's not at position 3, so we should avoid position 3 for A.

Therefore, in the second guess, we should put A in a position that is not 3, and T in a position that is not 4.

Possible positions for A: 1,2,4,5
For T: 1,2,3,5

Now, let's think of words that have A and T in these positions and avoid C,R,E.

Option 1: A at position 1, T at position 5: e.g., ""ABOUT"" -> but has O, U, B. But also, we can use. However, ""ABOUT"" has B, O, U, T. But we don't know about these.

But note: we have A at 1 and T at 5. Also, we avoid C,R,E.

Option 2: A at position 2, T at position 3: e.g., ""PATIO"" -> but has P, T, I, O. And A at 2, T at 3? Actually, ""PATIO"" is P-A-T-I-O: so A at 2, T at 3. But we don't know if T can be at 3? We haven't tested that.

But we must avoid R and E, so ""PATIO"" is okay.

However, we have to consider that we are limited to 5-letter words.

Another option: ""PASTA"" -> P-A-S-T-A. But has two A's? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But in the feedback, we only know that A is present at least once. So ""PASTA"" is a valid word, but it has A at position 2 and 5, and T at position 4. But we know T is not at position 4 (from first guess), so putting T at 4 again is not good. So avoid.

Better: ""PAINT"" as I thought earlier: P-A-I-N-T -> A at position 2, T at position 5. Both are new positions (A was 3, now 2; T was 4, now 5). And letters: P, A, I, N, T. All new except A and T.

Similarly, ""SAINT"": S-A-I-N-T -> A at 2, T at 5.

Or ""TASTY"": T-A-S-T-Y -> but T at position 1 and 4? We know T is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. Also, T at position 4: we know T is not at position 4, so that would be a waste. And A at position 2.

But in ""TASTY"", the first T is at position 1, which is a new position, and the second T at 4 is known to be wrong. So we would get feedback for the first T and the second T. But it might be inefficient because we already know T is not at 4.

So better to avoid known wrong positions.

Therefore, ""SAINT"" or ""PAINT"" are good.

Another word: ""DAILY"" but no T. We must include T and A.

We must include both A and T because they are in the word.

So let's choose between ""SAINT"" and ""PAINT"". Both are common words.

I think ""SAINT"" is a good choice because S is a very common letter.

So second guess: ""SAINT""

But let's double-check the positions:
- S at 1
- A at 2 (was 3 in first guess, so new)
- I at 3
- N at 4
- T at 5 (was 4 in first guess, now 5, so new)

This should be a good guess.

We might also consider ""PAINT"", but S is more common than P? Actually, both are fine.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has A and T and also tests other common vowels or consonants. But we have already tested A and E (E is out), so vowels: we know A is in, E is out. So we can test I, O, U.

In ""SAINT"", we test I and also S and N.

So I think ""SAINT"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, the second guess is ""SAINT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"":
- **C, R, E** are **not** in the word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").
- **T** is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked ""-"").

### Key Insights:
1. The secret word contains **A** and **T**, but they must be placed in new positions:
   - **A** cannot be in position 3 (so it must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5).
   - **T** cannot be in position 4 (so it must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5).
2. Avoid **C, R, E** entirely in future guesses.
3. To maximize information, the new guess should:
   - Include **A** and **T** in untested positions.
   - Introduce new common letters (e.g., S, I, N, L, O) to test their presence/absence.
   - Prioritize words with distinct letters to cover more ground.

### Why ""SAINT""?
- **A** is placed in position 2 (new position, not 3).
- **T** is placed in position 5 (new position, not 4).
- Uses new common letters: **S** (position 1), **I** (position 3), **N** (position 4).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, E).
- Tests high-frequency consonants (S, N) and a vowel (I), which could quickly reveal more about the secret word.

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SAINT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(✓)

From Guess 1:
- C, R, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.

From Guess 2:
- S, I, N are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was marked '-', not '✓').
- T is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 5 (since T was the last letter of SAINT).

We know T is at position 5 (✓).

Also, A is in the word but not at position 3 (from guess 1) and not at position 2 (from guess 2). So A must be at position 1 or 4.

We have the following information:
- The secret word has T at position 5: ... T
- A is present but must be at position 1 or 4.
- We know the word does not contain: C, R, E, S, I, N (from the x's).

We have tested letters: C, R, A, T, E, S, I, N. So 9 letters tested.

We know A is in and T is in (with T fixed at position 5).

We need to find a word that:
- Ends with T (since position 5 is T).
- Contains A, and A must be at position 1 or 4.
- Does not contain C, R, E, S, I, N.

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We have 4 letters left to guess: positions 1,2,3,4, but position 5 is fixed as T.

So the word is _ _ _ _ T

And A must be at position 1 or 4.

Case 1: A at position 1 -> A _ _ _ T
Case 2: A at position 4 -> _ _ _ A T

We need to fill the remaining positions with letters not in the excluded set: excluded letters are C, R, E, S, I, N.

Also, from guess 2, S, I, N are out.

So we can use: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now, we should look for common words that fit.

First, let's consider Case 1: A _ _ _ T

We need to fill positions 2,3,4 with letters not excluded.

Possible words: e.g., ABLET, but is that a word? No, ABLET is not common. 
ADULT? ADULT has D,U,L,T. But A at 1 and T at 5? ADULT is A-D-U-L-T -> positions: A(1),D(2),U(3),L(4),T(5) -> 5th is T, which matches.

But we must check if it uses only allowed letters: A,D,U,L,T. Are any excluded? Excluded: C,R,E,S,I,N. D,U,L are not excluded. So ADULT is possible.

Another word: AGENT? But AGENT has G,E,N,T -> E and N are excluded (E and N are x in previous feedback). So invalid.

AUDIT? AUDIT has A,U,D,I,T -> I is excluded (from guess 2, I is x). So invalid.

APART? APART has A,P,A,R,T -> R is excluded (R is in guess 1 as x). Invalid.

ABOUT? ABOUT has A,B,O,U,T -> but ends with T? ABOUT is A-B-O-U-T, so last letter T? Yes, position 5 is T. Letters: A,B,O,U,T. No exclusions: B,O,U are not in the excluded list. So ABOUT is possible.

But ABOUT has O and U, which are vowels. We might get useful information.

ADOPT? ADOPT has A,D,O,P,T -> all allowed. So ADOPT is possible.

But we have another case: A at position 4.

Case 2: _ _ _ A T

For example: __ __ __ A T

Possible words: ULTRA? U-L-T-R-A -> but R is excluded. Invalid.

DELTA? D-E-L-T-A -> E is excluded. Invalid.

OVERT? O-V-E-R-T -> E and R excluded. Invalid.

So let's list possible words for case 1 (Axxxx with xxT): actually A * * * T.

Common words:
- ABOUT: A B O U T
- ADULT: A D U L T
- ADAPT: A D A P T -> but has two A's? We don't know if the word has duplicate A. But it could. But in ADAPT, A is at position 1,3? But we have A at 1 and T at 5. But letter at pos3 is A, which we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it can be at pos3? Wait, from guess 1, A was at position 3 and got '-', meaning that A is in the word but not at position 3. So in the secret word, A cannot be at position 3. Therefore, any word with A at position 3 is invalid because we know A is not at position 3.

Therefore, ADAPT has A at position 3, which is forbidden. So ADAPT is invalid.

Similarly, any word that places A at position 3 is invalid.

In case 1: A at position 1, so positions 2,3,4 cannot have A? Actually, no. We know that A is not at position 3, but it could be at other positions including duplicates.

But we don't have information about duplicates. So possibly the word has two A's? But in our guesses, we only had one A. However, in WORDLE, duplicates are allowed.

But important: from feedback, only one A was marked, but if there were two, we might not know? Actually, the feedback would indicate each occurrence.

In guess 1: CRATE had A at position 3 and we got '-', meaning there is at least one A not at position 3. It doesn't say if there are two.

Similarly, in guess 2: SAINT had A at position 2 and we got '-', meaning at least one A not at position 2.

But we don't know if there is an A at position 3? We know that position 3 cannot have A because when we placed A at 3 in guess 1, we got '-' which means it's not correct, so there is no A at position 3. Similarly, no at position 2.

So the secret word does not have A in position 2 or 3.

Therefore, A must be at 1 or 4, and if there is a duplicate A, it must not be at 2 or 3.

But for our guess, we must not place A at position 2 or 3.

Therefore, in our new guess:

For case 1 (A at 1): A * * * T
Position 2 can be any letter, but not A? But A cannot be at position 2? We don't know. The secret word might have another A at position 4, for example.

But for our guess, we can put A at positions where it's allowed.

Since we are guessing, we can place A only at positions we don't know to be wrong.

So to be safe, we should avoid positions 2 and 3 for A in this guess.

But in case 1: if we do A at 1, then positions 2,3,4 cannot be A? Not necessarily, but we can try to avoid duplicates to test other letters.

But let's proceed.

Possible words for Case 1 (A at 1 and T at 5, and A not at 3, which is automatically satisfied since we are not putting A at 3 in this case? Wait, position 3 is the third letter.

So words: ABOUT (A,B,O,U,T) -> positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T -> no A at 2 or 3.

ADULT (A,D,U,L,T) -> positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:U, 4:L, 5:T -> no issue.

ADOPT (A,D,O,P,T) -> positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:O, 4:P, 5:T.

AGLET? Not common.

CASE 2: A at position 4: _ _ _ A T

And A cannot be at position 2 or 3, which is fine.

Possible words: 
- PIZZA? Has Z, which might be rare, and I and Z are not excluded? I is excluded (from guess 2, I(x)). Invalid.
- ULTRA? Has R, excluded. Invalid.
- VISTA? V,I,S,T,A -> but I and S excluded. Invalid.
- BOXTA? Not a word.
- So, what about PLAZA? P-L-A-Z-A -> but ends with A, not T. No.
  We need ending with T.

Examples: DELTA? Excludes E.
MOTTO? Does not end with T.
Maybe: GLOAT? G-L-O-A-T -> so A at position 4, T at 5? Yes. Letters: G,L,O,A,T.
Check exclusions: G,L,O are not excluded? Excluded: C,R,E,S,I,N. So G,L,O allowed.
GLOAT is a word.

Similarly: BLOAT (B,L,O,A,T) -> same.
FLOAT (F,L,O,A,T) -> same.

Other: OVATE? E is excluded.

So possible words for case 2: GLOAT, BLOAT, FLOAT.

But we have two cases.

To decide which case to test, we need to choose a word that gives information.

We can choose a word that covers one case but tests more letters.

For example, if we choose ABOUT: it tests A at 1, T at 5, and introduces B,O,U.

Similarly, ADULT: tests A at1, T at5, and D,U,L.

GLOAT: tests A at4, T at5, and G,L,O.

We need to consider that in the secret word, A is not at position 2 or 3, so it must be at 1 or 4.

Therefore, if we guess a word with A at position 1, and it turns out A is actually at position 4, we will get A marked as '-' or if at position 1 correctly, we get '✓'.

But similarly for other positions.

To test both possibilities, but we cannot cover all.

We could choose a word that does not have A at position 1 or 4? But we know A must be at 1 or 4 in the secret word. For our guess, we can put A at 1 or 4 to test it.

But if we put A at 1, we are testing the hypothesis that A is at position 1. Similarly for A at 4.

Alternatively, we could put A at another position? But we know A cannot be at 2 or 3, so we should avoid that. Also, position 5 is T, so A can only be at 1 or 4.

So in our guess, we should have A at either position 1 or position 4.

Also, we must include T at position 5.

So let's list possible words:

Option 1: ABOUT - A at1, T at5, letters: A,B,O,U,T. But T is already known, so we are testing B,O,U.

Option 2: ADULT - A at1, T at5, letters: A,D,U,L,T. Testing D,U,L.

Option 3: ADOPT - A at1, T at5, letters: A,D,O,P,T. Testing D,O,P.

Option 4: GLOAT - A at4, T at5, letters: G,L,O,A,T. Testing G,L,O.

Option 5: BLOAT - B,L,O,A,T. Testing B,L,O.

Notice that some letters overlap.

We want to maximize the number of new letters to gather more information.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,O,P,U,V,W,Y, etc.

Common letters include L, O, P, U, D, B, etc.

ABOUT introduces B,O,U — three new letters.

ADOPT introduces D,O,P — also three.

GLOAT introduces G,L,O — three.

But if we choose ABOUT or GLOAT, we have O in common.

Since we know T is fixed, we can focus on the first four letters.

Also, we might consider that in ADULT, we have U and L, which are common.

But we have limited guesses, so we should pick a word that might be the answer.

Another constraint: the secret word has A and T (with T at 5), and one more A? Or others.

But we don't know.

Let's see feedback: from guess 2, T is at position 5, so that's fixed.

Now, we need to find if A is at 1 or 4.

So if we guess a word with A at position 1, and if the secret word has A at 1, we might get a ✓ for A. If not, we get '-', meaning A is at 4.

Similarly, if we put A at 4 and it's correct, we get ✓, else if at 1 we get '-'.

Either way, we can disambiguate.

But we also want to test other letters.

So let's choose a word that has many common untested letters.

For example, let's try ABOUT: A,B,O,U,T 
- It tests A at position 1: if ✓, we know A is at 1. If '-', then A must be at 4.
- It tests B, O, U: if any of these are in the word.

Similarly, GLOAT: if we try G,L,O,A,T, we test A at position 4: if ✓, then A at 4 confirmed; if not, A must be at 1. And test G,L,O.

But ADOPT: A at1, tests D,O,P.

Among these, ABOUT uses B,O,U — all common.

Another word: AWAKE? But K and E — E is excluded. Invalid.

We need to avoid excluded letters.

So let's choose ABOUT.

But we must ensure the word is valid. ABOUT is a valid word.

Similarly, POUTY? But has Y and no A? We need to include A? No, we don't have to include A? Wait, but we know A is in the word, so we should include it to confirm its position.

Yes, we should include A because it's present.

Therefore, our guess must include A.

So ABOUT includes A.

But ABOUT: A-B-O-U-T.

Now, let's see what positions we have: A at1, which is a possible position.

But in the secret word, if A is at4, then when we guess ABOUT, the A at1 will be '-', meaning it's there but not at1, which would tell us A must be at4.

Similarly, if we guess GLOAT, and A is at1, the A at4 will be '-'.

In both cases, we get information about A's position.

Now, which to choose? Let's pick one with high-scoring letters.

Letters frequency: in English, E is most common but excluded, then T,A,... etc. We have T and A already.

O, U, B are relatively common.

L is also common.

I think ABOUT is a better choice because it uses O and U which are vowels that haven't been tested.

Similarly, GLOAT has O.

But O is in both.

Another option: AUDIT? But I is excluded.

Invalid.

ADMIN? But M,N,I — N and I are excluded.

Invalid.

So ABOUT seems good.

But what about ABHOR? But no T? We need T at5? Yes, ABOUT has T at5.

ABHOR ends with R, which is excluded.

So ABOUT is fine.

But wait, in ABOUT, the T is at5, which we already know is correct, so it will be ✓. We are testing the other positions.

We could choose a word that doesn't have T at5? But position 5 is fixed as T, so any guess must end with T.

Because we know T is at position 5.

Therefore, all guesses must end with T.

So our new guess must end with T, and include A at position 1 or 4.

Therefore, possible guesses: ABOUT, ADULT, ADOPT, GLOAT, BLOAT, FLOAT, etc.

Now, to decide: let's see which word minimizes overlap with previous.

Previous used letters: Guess1: C,R,A,T,E; Guess2: S,A,I,N,T. So letters used: C,R,A,T,E,S,I,N.

Now, new letters for new guess: we want new.

ABOUT letters: A,B,O,U,T -> T and A are repeated. So new are B,O,U.

ADULT: A,D,U,L,T -> new: D,U,L.

ADOPT: A,D,O,P,T -> new: D,O,P.

GLOAT: G,L,O,A,T -> new: G,L,O.

All have three new letters.

BLOAT: B,L,O,A,T -> new: B,L,O.

FLOAT: F,L,O,A,T -> new: F,L,O.

Perhaps OVERLAP is not a problem since we are testing new letters.

We could try to cover positions 2 and 3 which are unknown.

For example, in ABOUT, position 2 is B, position 3 is O, position 4 is U.

If A is at 1, and we guess ABOUT, and if A is at 1, then B,O,U need to match.

If not, then A must be at 4, and B,O,U might be wrong.

But maybe it's better to choose GLOAT because if A is at 4, and we guess GLOAT, then G,L,O at positions 1,2,3.

But in the secret word, if A is at 4, then positions 1,2,3 are G,L,O or whatever.

If A is at 1, then positions 2,3,4 are ?,?,A? But it depends.

I think we can go with ABOUT for now.

But let's see if we can find a word with more common letters.

Another word: POUTY? But ends with Y? No, ends with T? POUTY is P-O-U-T-Y, ends with Y. Not ending with T.

OUTED? Has E, excluded.

So ABOUT is good.

But ABOUT has two U's? No, B is the second.

ABOUT has unique letters.

We can choose ADULT: which includes L, which is common.

But ADULT has D,U,L.

Similarly, FLOAT has L,O,F.

Perhaps L is a good letter to test.

Let me think of the word: what are possible secret words.

Based on what we know, possible forms:

If A at position 1: the word is A X Y Z T, with X,Y,Z not excluded, and A not at 3 (automatically? Position 1, not 3), and no A at 2 or 3? We can have duplicates but must avoid positions 2 and 3 for A. But X,Y,Z could be anything except C,R,E,S,I,N.

And not A at position 3.

For example: ABOTT? Not a word.
ADMIT? Has M,I — I excluded.
ADEPT? E excluded.
So really, ABOUT, ADULT, ADOPT, etc.

Similarly, if A at position 4: words like GLOAT, BLOAT, FLOAT, PLOAT? Not common.

Or TALAT? Not common.

So common ones are: ABOUT, ADULT, ADOPT, GLOAT, BLOAT, FLOAT.

We can also consider: ALBAT? But not common.

So we have to pick among these.

Let's choose FLOAT because F is less common, but BLOAT and FLOAT are similar.

We can choose BLOAT to test B and L.

But ABOUT tests O and U.

U is less common than L? In English, L is more common than U? L is about 4%, U is about 2.5%. But O is very common.

In the remaining positions, position 2,3,4 would benefit from common letters.

So maybe GLOAT or ABOUT.

Another factor: in guess 2, SAINT had N at position 4, which was wrong. In our new guess, position 4 in case of GLOAT is A, but in ABOUT it is U.

We want to test position 4? But it depends on A.

Perhaps a good strategy is to avoid placing A at position 1 if we think it might not be there, but we don't know.

So let's pick a word that has A at position 4, to test that possibility explicitly.

For example, if we pick GLOAT, with A at position 4, and T at 5.

If A is at 4, then if correct, we get A✓, else we know A is at 1.

And we test G,L,O.

Similarly, if we pick ABOUT, A at1, we test that and B,O,U.

I think either is fine.

Let's pick GLOAT for a change.

Or to keep vowels, ABOUT has O and U.

But ABOUT has B which is a consonant.

We can look for a word that includes more vowels, but vowels: we have A already, and E is excluded, so O and U and I (excluded) so little choice.

So I'll go with ABOUT.

But let's confirm: is ABOUT a valid Wordle word? I think so.

Therefore, guess: ABOUT.

Response format.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

**Summary of Known Information:**
- From Guess 1 (CRATE): 
  - ""A"" is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - ""T"" is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - C, R, and E are **not** in the word.
- From Guess 2 (SAINT): 
  - ""T"" is in the correct position (position 5).  
  - ""A"" is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - S, I, and N are **not** in the word.
- **Key Constraints:**  
  - The secret word ends with ""T"" (position 5 is fixed).  
  - ""A"" must be in position 1 or 4 (since it cannot be in position 2 or 3).  
  - Excluded letters: C, R, E, S, I, N.  
- Untested common letters available: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  

### Step-by-Step Reasoning for the Next Guess:
1. **Finalize the ""T"" position:** Since ""T"" is confirmed at position 5, all guesses must end with ""T"".
2. **Position of ""A"":** We need to test if ""A"" is at position 1 or 4. A good guess will place ""A"" in one of these positions to force clear feedback:
   - If ""A"" is guessed at position 1 and is correct, feedback will show ✓; if incorrect, it will show ""−"" and confirm ""A"" is at position 4.  
   - Similarly, guessing ""A"" at position 4 will reveal its true position.  
3. **Maximize new information:** The guess should introduce 3 new high-frequency letters (e.g., O, U, L, B, D) to test for presence/absence and narrow down possibilities. Avoid letters already excluded (C, R, E, S, I, N).  
4. **Valid word options:**  
   - **""ABOUT""**: Tests ""A"" at position 1, ends with ""T"", and introduces new letters B, O, U.  
   - **""ADULT""**: Tests ""A"" at position 1, ends with ""T"", and introduces D, U, L.  
   - **""GLOAT""**: Tests ""A"" at position 4, ends with ""T"", and introduces G, L, O.  
5. **Why choose ""ABOUT""?**  
   - It efficiently tests ""A"" at position 1.  
   - Uses common letters: ""O"" (vowel) and ""U"" (vowel) are high-frequency, and ""B"" is a common consonant. This maximizes the chance of revealing new information about the secret word.  
   - If ""A"" is not at position 1, feedback will pin it to position 4, and B/O/U results will further restrict the word pool.  
   - Example: Secret words like ""ABOUT"" itself or ""ADOPT"" (case-sensitive) could be validated, while words like ""FLOAT"" (if ""A"" is at position 4) would be ruled out.  
   - Alternative options like ""GLOAT"" test less common first letters (e.g., ""G""), so ""ABOUT"" is preferable for its letter frequency.

**Final Decision:** Guess ""ABOUT"" to test positions for ""A"" and cover key new letters.  

<guess>ABOUT</guess>",ABOUT,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SAINT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(✓)

From Guess 1:
- C, R, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.

From Guess 2:
- S, I, N are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was marked '-', not '✓').
- T is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 5 (since T was the last letter of SAINT).

We know T is at position 5 (✓).

Also, A is in the word but not at position 3 (from guess 1) and not at position 2 (from guess 2). So A must be at position 1 or 4.

We have the following information:
- The secret word has T at position 5: ... T
- A is present but must be at position 1 or 4.
- We know the word does not contain: C, R, E, S, I, N (from the x's).

We have tested letters: C, R, A, T, E, S, I, N. So 9 letters tested.

We know A is in and T is in (with T fixed at position 5).

We need to find a word that:
- Ends with T (since position 5 is T).
- Contains A, and A must be at position 1 or 4.
- Does not contain C, R, E, S, I, N.

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We have 4 letters left to guess: positions 1,2,3,4, but position 5 is fixed as T.

So the word is _ _ _ _ T

And A must be at position 1 or 4.

Case 1: A at position 1 -> A _ _ _ T
Case 2: A at position 4 -> _ _ _ A T

We need to fill the remaining positions with letters not in the excluded set: excluded letters are C, R, E, S, I, N.

Also, from guess 2, S, I, N are out.

So we can use: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now, we should look for common words that fit.

First, let's consider Case 1: A _ _ _ T

We need to fill positions 2,3,4 with letters not excluded.

Possible words: e.g., ABLET, but is that a word? No, ABLET is not common. 
ADULT? ADULT has D,U,L,T. But A at 1 and T at 5? ADULT is A-D-U-L-T -> positions: A(1),D(2),U(3),L(4),T(5) -> 5th is T, which matches.

But we must check if it uses only allowed letters: A,D,U,L,T. Are any excluded? Excluded: C,R,E,S,I,N. D,U,L are not excluded. So ADULT is possible.

Another word: AGENT? But AGENT has G,E,N,T -> E and N are excluded (E and N are x in previous feedback). So invalid.

AUDIT? AUDIT has A,U,D,I,T -> I is excluded (from guess 2, I is x). So invalid.

APART? APART has A,P,A,R,T -> R is excluded (R is in guess 1 as x). Invalid.

ABOUT? ABOUT has A,B,O,U,T -> but ends with T? ABOUT is A-B-O-U-T, so last letter T? Yes, position 5 is T. Letters: A,B,O,U,T. No exclusions: B,O,U are not in the excluded list. So ABOUT is possible.

But ABOUT has O and U, which are vowels. We might get useful information.

ADOPT? ADOPT has A,D,O,P,T -> all allowed. So ADOPT is possible.

But we have another case: A at position 4.

Case 2: _ _ _ A T

For example: __ __ __ A T

Possible words: ULTRA? U-L-T-R-A -> but R is excluded. Invalid.

DELTA? D-E-L-T-A -> E is excluded. Invalid.

OVERT? O-V-E-R-T -> E and R excluded. Invalid.

So let's list possible words for case 1 (Axxxx with xxT): actually A * * * T.

Common words:
- ABOUT: A B O U T
- ADULT: A D U L T
- ADAPT: A D A P T -> but has two A's? We don't know if the word has duplicate A. But it could. But in ADAPT, A is at position 1,3? But we have A at 1 and T at 5. But letter at pos3 is A, which we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it can be at pos3? Wait, from guess 1, A was at position 3 and got '-', meaning that A is in the word but not at position 3. So in the secret word, A cannot be at position 3. Therefore, any word with A at position 3 is invalid because we know A is not at position 3.

Therefore, ADAPT has A at position 3, which is forbidden. So ADAPT is invalid.

Similarly, any word that places A at position 3 is invalid.

In case 1: A at position 1, so positions 2,3,4 cannot have A? Actually, no. We know that A is not at position 3, but it could be at other positions including duplicates.

But we don't have information about duplicates. So possibly the word has two A's? But in our guesses, we only had one A. However, in WORDLE, duplicates are allowed.

But important: from feedback, only one A was marked, but if there were two, we might not know? Actually, the feedback would indicate each occurrence.

In guess 1: CRATE had A at position 3 and we got '-', meaning there is at least one A not at position 3. It doesn't say if there are two.

Similarly, in guess 2: SAINT had A at position 2 and we got '-', meaning at least one A not at position 2.

But we don't know if there is an A at position 3? We know that position 3 cannot have A because when we placed A at 3 in guess 1, we got '-' which means it's not correct, so there is no A at position 3. Similarly, no at position 2.

So the secret word does not have A in position 2 or 3.

Therefore, A must be at 1 or 4, and if there is a duplicate A, it must not be at 2 or 3.

But for our guess, we must not place A at position 2 or 3.

Therefore, in our new guess:

For case 1 (A at 1): A * * * T
Position 2 can be any letter, but not A? But A cannot be at position 2? We don't know. The secret word might have another A at position 4, for example.

But for our guess, we can put A at positions where it's allowed.

Since we are guessing, we can place A only at positions we don't know to be wrong.

So to be safe, we should avoid positions 2 and 3 for A in this guess.

But in case 1: if we do A at 1, then positions 2,3,4 cannot be A? Not necessarily, but we can try to avoid duplicates to test other letters.

But let's proceed.

Possible words for Case 1 (A at 1 and T at 5, and A not at 3, which is automatically satisfied since we are not putting A at 3 in this case? Wait, position 3 is the third letter.

So words: ABOUT (A,B,O,U,T) -> positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:O, 4:U, 5:T -> no A at 2 or 3.

ADULT (A,D,U,L,T) -> positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:U, 4:L, 5:T -> no issue.

ADOPT (A,D,O,P,T) -> positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:O, 4:P, 5:T.

AGLET? Not common.

CASE 2: A at position 4: _ _ _ A T

And A cannot be at position 2 or 3, which is fine.

Possible words: 
- PIZZA? Has Z, which might be rare, and I and Z are not excluded? I is excluded (from guess 2, I(x)). Invalid.
- ULTRA? Has R, excluded. Invalid.
- VISTA? V,I,S,T,A -> but I and S excluded. Invalid.
- BOXTA? Not a word.
- So, what about PLAZA? P-L-A-Z-A -> but ends with A, not T. No.
  We need ending with T.

Examples: DELTA? Excludes E.
MOTTO? Does not end with T.
Maybe: GLOAT? G-L-O-A-T -> so A at position 4, T at 5? Yes. Letters: G,L,O,A,T.
Check exclusions: G,L,O are not excluded? Excluded: C,R,E,S,I,N. So G,L,O allowed.
GLOAT is a word.

Similarly: BLOAT (B,L,O,A,T) -> same.
FLOAT (F,L,O,A,T) -> same.

Other: OVATE? E is excluded.

So possible words for case 2: GLOAT, BLOAT, FLOAT.

But we have two cases.

To decide which case to test, we need to choose a word that gives information.

We can choose a word that covers one case but tests more letters.

For example, if we choose ABOUT: it tests A at 1, T at 5, and introduces B,O,U.

Similarly, ADULT: tests A at1, T at5, and D,U,L.

GLOAT: tests A at4, T at5, and G,L,O.

We need to consider that in the secret word, A is not at position 2 or 3, so it must be at 1 or 4.

Therefore, if we guess a word with A at position 1, and it turns out A is actually at position 4, we will get A marked as '-' or if at position 1 correctly, we get '✓'.

But similarly for other positions.

To test both possibilities, but we cannot cover all.

We could choose a word that does not have A at position 1 or 4? But we know A must be at 1 or 4 in the secret word. For our guess, we can put A at 1 or 4 to test it.

But if we put A at 1, we are testing the hypothesis that A is at position 1. Similarly for A at 4.

Alternatively, we could put A at another position? But we know A cannot be at 2 or 3, so we should avoid that. Also, position 5 is T, so A can only be at 1 or 4.

So in our guess, we should have A at either position 1 or position 4.

Also, we must include T at position 5.

So let's list possible words:

Option 1: ABOUT - A at1, T at5, letters: A,B,O,U,T. But T is already known, so we are testing B,O,U.

Option 2: ADULT - A at1, T at5, letters: A,D,U,L,T. Testing D,U,L.

Option 3: ADOPT - A at1, T at5, letters: A,D,O,P,T. Testing D,O,P.

Option 4: GLOAT - A at4, T at5, letters: G,L,O,A,T. Testing G,L,O.

Option 5: BLOAT - B,L,O,A,T. Testing B,L,O.

Notice that some letters overlap.

We want to maximize the number of new letters to gather more information.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,O,P,U,V,W,Y, etc.

Common letters include L, O, P, U, D, B, etc.

ABOUT introduces B,O,U — three new letters.

ADOPT introduces D,O,P — also three.

GLOAT introduces G,L,O — three.

But if we choose ABOUT or GLOAT, we have O in common.

Since we know T is fixed, we can focus on the first four letters.

Also, we might consider that in ADULT, we have U and L, which are common.

But we have limited guesses, so we should pick a word that might be the answer.

Another constraint: the secret word has A and T (with T at 5), and one more A? Or others.

But we don't know.

Let's see feedback: from guess 2, T is at position 5, so that's fixed.

Now, we need to find if A is at 1 or 4.

So if we guess a word with A at position 1, and if the secret word has A at 1, we might get a ✓ for A. If not, we get '-', meaning A is at 4.

Similarly, if we put A at 4 and it's correct, we get ✓, else if at 1 we get '-'.

Either way, we can disambiguate.

But we also want to test other letters.

So let's choose a word that has many common untested letters.

For example, let's try ABOUT: A,B,O,U,T 
- It tests A at position 1: if ✓, we know A is at 1. If '-', then A must be at 4.
- It tests B, O, U: if any of these are in the word.

Similarly, GLOAT: if we try G,L,O,A,T, we test A at position 4: if ✓, then A at 4 confirmed; if not, A must be at 1. And test G,L,O.

But ADOPT: A at1, tests D,O,P.

Among these, ABOUT uses B,O,U — all common.

Another word: AWAKE? But K and E — E is excluded. Invalid.

We need to avoid excluded letters.

So let's choose ABOUT.

But we must ensure the word is valid. ABOUT is a valid word.

Similarly, POUTY? But has Y and no A? We need to include A? No, we don't have to include A? Wait, but we know A is in the word, so we should include it to confirm its position.

Yes, we should include A because it's present.

Therefore, our guess must include A.

So ABOUT includes A.

But ABOUT: A-B-O-U-T.

Now, let's see what positions we have: A at1, which is a possible position.

But in the secret word, if A is at4, then when we guess ABOUT, the A at1 will be '-', meaning it's there but not at1, which would tell us A must be at4.

Similarly, if we guess GLOAT, and A is at1, the A at4 will be '-'.

In both cases, we get information about A's position.

Now, which to choose? Let's pick one with high-scoring letters.

Letters frequency: in English, E is most common but excluded, then T,A,... etc. We have T and A already.

O, U, B are relatively common.

L is also common.

I think ABOUT is a better choice because it uses O and U which are vowels that haven't been tested.

Similarly, GLOAT has O.

But O is in both.

Another option: AUDIT? But I is excluded.

Invalid.

ADMIN? But M,N,I — N and I are excluded.

Invalid.

So ABOUT seems good.

But what about ABHOR? But no T? We need T at5? Yes, ABOUT has T at5.

ABHOR ends with R, which is excluded.

So ABOUT is fine.

But wait, in ABOUT, the T is at5, which we already know is correct, so it will be ✓. We are testing the other positions.

We could choose a word that doesn't have T at5? But position 5 is fixed as T, so any guess must end with T.

Because we know T is at position 5.

Therefore, all guesses must end with T.

So our new guess must end with T, and include A at position 1 or 4.

Therefore, possible guesses: ABOUT, ADULT, ADOPT, GLOAT, BLOAT, FLOAT, etc.

Now, to decide: let's see which word minimizes overlap with previous.

Previous used letters: Guess1: C,R,A,T,E; Guess2: S,A,I,N,T. So letters used: C,R,A,T,E,S,I,N.

Now, new letters for new guess: we want new.

ABOUT letters: A,B,O,U,T -> T and A are repeated. So new are B,O,U.

ADULT: A,D,U,L,T -> new: D,U,L.

ADOPT: A,D,O,P,T -> new: D,O,P.

GLOAT: G,L,O,A,T -> new: G,L,O.

All have three new letters.

BLOAT: B,L,O,A,T -> new: B,L,O.

FLOAT: F,L,O,A,T -> new: F,L,O.

Perhaps OVERLAP is not a problem since we are testing new letters.

We could try to cover positions 2 and 3 which are unknown.

For example, in ABOUT, position 2 is B, position 3 is O, position 4 is U.

If A is at 1, and we guess ABOUT, and if A is at 1, then B,O,U need to match.

If not, then A must be at 4, and B,O,U might be wrong.

But maybe it's better to choose GLOAT because if A is at 4, and we guess GLOAT, then G,L,O at positions 1,2,3.

But in the secret word, if A is at 4, then positions 1,2,3 are G,L,O or whatever.

If A is at 1, then positions 2,3,4 are ?,?,A? But it depends.

I think we can go with ABOUT for now.

But let's see if we can find a word with more common letters.

Another word: POUTY? But ends with Y? No, ends with T? POUTY is P-O-U-T-Y, ends with Y. Not ending with T.

OUTED? Has E, excluded.

So ABOUT is good.

But ABOUT has two U's? No, B is the second.

ABOUT has unique letters.

We can choose ADULT: which includes L, which is common.

But ADULT has D,U,L.

Similarly, FLOAT has L,O,F.

Perhaps L is a good letter to test.

Let me think of the word: what are possible secret words.

Based on what we know, possible forms:

If A at position 1: the word is A X Y Z T, with X,Y,Z not excluded, and A not at 3 (automatically? Position 1, not 3), and no A at 2 or 3? We can have duplicates but must avoid positions 2 and 3 for A. But X,Y,Z could be anything except C,R,E,S,I,N.

And not A at position 3.

For example: ABOTT? Not a word.
ADMIT? Has M,I — I excluded.
ADEPT? E excluded.
So really, ABOUT, ADULT, ADOPT, etc.

Similarly, if A at position 4: words like GLOAT, BLOAT, FLOAT, PLOAT? Not common.

Or TALAT? Not common.

So common ones are: ABOUT, ADULT, ADOPT, GLOAT, BLOAT, FLOAT.

We can also consider: ALBAT? But not common.

So we have to pick among these.

Let's choose FLOAT because F is less common, but BLOAT and FLOAT are similar.

We can choose BLOAT to test B and L.

But ABOUT tests O and U.

U is less common than L? In English, L is more common than U? L is about 4%, U is about 2.5%. But O is very common.

In the remaining positions, position 2,3,4 would benefit from common letters.

So maybe GLOAT or ABOUT.

Another factor: in guess 2, SAINT had N at position 4, which was wrong. In our new guess, position 4 in case of GLOAT is A, but in ABOUT it is U.

We want to test position 4? But it depends on A.

Perhaps a good strategy is to avoid placing A at position 1 if we think it might not be there, but we don't know.

So let's pick a word that has A at position 4, to test that possibility explicitly.

For example, if we pick GLOAT, with A at position 4, and T at 5.

If A is at 4, then if correct, we get A✓, else we know A is at 1.

And we test G,L,O.

Similarly, if we pick ABOUT, A at1, we test that and B,O,U.

I think either is fine.

Let's pick GLOAT for a change.

Or to keep vowels, ABOUT has O and U.

But ABOUT has B which is a consonant.

We can look for a word that includes more vowels, but vowels: we have A already, and E is excluded, so O and U and I (excluded) so little choice.

So I'll go with ABOUT.

But let's confirm: is ABOUT a valid Wordle word? I think so.

Therefore, guess: ABOUT.

Response format.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

**Summary of Known Information:**
- From Guess 1 (CRATE): 
  - ""A"" is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - ""T"" is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - C, R, and E are **not** in the word.
- From Guess 2 (SAINT): 
  - ""T"" is in the correct position (position 5).  
  - ""A"" is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - S, I, and N are **not** in the word.
- **Key Constraints:**  
  - The secret word ends with ""T"" (position 5 is fixed).  
  - ""A"" must be in position 1 or 4 (since it cannot be in position 2 or 3).  
  - Excluded letters: C, R, E, S, I, N.  
- Untested common letters available: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  

### Step-by-Step Reasoning for the Next Guess:
1. **Finalize the ""T"" position:** Since ""T"" is confirmed at position 5, all guesses must end with ""T"".
2. **Position of ""A"":** We need to test if ""A"" is at position 1 or 4. A good guess will place ""A"" in one of these positions to force clear feedback:
   - If ""A"" is guessed at position 1 and is correct, feedback will show ✓; if incorrect, it will show ""−"" and confirm ""A"" is at position 4.  
   - Similarly, guessing ""A"" at position 4 will reveal its true position.  
3. **Maximize new information:** The guess should introduce 3 new high-frequency letters (e.g., O, U, L, B, D) to test for presence/absence and narrow down possibilities. Avoid letters already excluded (C, R, E, S, I, N).  
4. **Valid word options:**  
   - **""ABOUT""**: Tests ""A"" at position 1, ends with ""T"", and introduces new letters B, O, U.  
   - **""ADULT""**: Tests ""A"" at position 1, ends with ""T"", and introduces D, U, L.  
   - **""GLOAT""**: Tests ""A"" at position 4, ends with ""T"", and introduces G, L, O.  
5. **Why choose ""ABOUT""?**  
   - It efficiently tests ""A"" at position 1.  
   - Uses common letters: ""O"" (vowel) and ""U"" (vowel) are high-frequency, and ""B"" is a common consonant. This maximizes the chance of revealing new information about the secret word.  
   - If ""A"" is not at position 1, feedback will pin it to position 4, and B/O/U results will further restrict the word pool.  
   - Example: Secret words like ""ABOUT"" itself or ""ADOPT"" (case-sensitive) could be validated, while words like ""FLOAT"" (if ""A"" is at position 4) would be ruled out.  
   - Alternative options like ""GLOAT"" test less common first letters (e.g., ""G""), so ""ABOUT"" is preferable for its letter frequency.

**Final Decision:** Guess ""ABOUT"" to test positions for ""A"" and cover key new letters.",Guess 3: ABOUT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(✓) O(✓) U(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
