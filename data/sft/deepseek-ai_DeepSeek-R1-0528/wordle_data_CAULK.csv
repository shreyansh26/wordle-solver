We are starting the game. We need to make the first guess. Since there's no prior information, we choose a word that has common letters and might help reveal the structure.
 A good starting word often has distinct letters and common vowels and consonants. Examples include words like ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", etc.
 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"". Let's consider that. But note: we can also use ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 However, let's pick ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
   - The letters are distinct, so we can get maximum information.

 So, we'll go with ""CRANE"".
</think>
I need to make the first guess without any prior information. A strong starting word should include common English letters and maximize information gain. Ideally, it should contain frequently occurring vowels and consonants, and prioritize letters that appear in many words. 

After considering common starting words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", and ""ROAST"", I choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) which are highly common
- Uses important consonants (C, R, N) that frequently appear in 5-letter words
- All letters are distinct, providing maximum coverage
- Ranked among top starting words by Wordle strategy analyses

This guess will give clear feedback on these five letters and their positions, setting up a strong foundation for subsequent guesses regardless of the secret word.

We are given feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
C(✓) -> C is correct and in the right position (position 1).
R(x) -> R is not in the word at all.
A(-) -> A is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was guessed at position 4). Since R is not in the word, A must be elsewhere.
N(x) -> N is not in the word.
E(x) -> E is not in the word.

So, we know:
- The first letter is C.
- The letter A is present somewhere in the word, but not in position 4 (and since position 1 is taken by C, A must be in position 2, 3, or 5).
- Letters R, N, E are absent.

We also know the word has 5 letters and starts with C.

We need to choose a new guess that:
- Starts with C (since C is confirmed).
- Includes the letter A, but not in position 4 (so in position 2, 3, or 5).
- Avoids the letters R, N, E.

Let's think of common words that start with C and have an A in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Possible positions for A:
- Position 2: e.g., CA___
- Position 3: e.g., C_A__
- Position 5: e.g., C____A

But note: we cannot use letters R, N, E.

We should also consider other common letters to maximize information.

Common consonants left: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, etc.

Let's brainstorm words:

For position 2 (CA___):
- CAB...? Avoid R,N,E -> CABAL? but has A again? But we know A is already one letter. However, CABAL has A in two positions? But we don't know if there are duplicate letters. But the feedback for A was a single dash, meaning at least one A exists but misplaced, but there could be more? However, the feedback only shows the first occurrence? Actually, in Wordle rules, feedback is per instance. For CRANE, the A is at position 4 and got a dash, so there is at least one A elsewhere. But if the word had two A's, the dash would only appear for the A in position 4? And the rest might be marked? But let's not assume duplicates yet.

Actually, the feedback tells us:
- For each guessed letter, what happens. If there are duplicate letters in the guess, it can be tricky, but here we don't have duplicates in CRANE.

So for now, we know one A is present and not in position 4.

Possible words:

List of common words starting with C:

- With A in position 2: words like CABBY, CACTI, CADDY, CADET, CAFES, CAULK, CAVIL, ...
But avoid R,N,E.

CADET: has E -> skip.
CAFES: has E and S? But E is absent, so no.
CACTI: letters: C,A,C,T,I -> but C is duplicated? However, our word may have duplicates? Possible. But note feedback: C was at position 1 and was correct, so if we write CACTI, the first C is same, but second C is new. But the secret word has at least one C at start? It might have more but in the feedback for CRANE only first C was given.

But the feedback showed only one C as correct. So if the word had two C's, and we guessed CRANE with only one C, the additional C in the word wouldn't be reflected. But the guess must be a valid word. So CACTI is a word. However, letters: C (at 1), A (at 2), C (at 3), T (at 4), I (at 5). But we have to avoid R,N,E and we are including T and I.

But note: the feedback doesn't prohibit T or I. Also, CACTI has two C's? The secret word might or might not have duplicates.

Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates for simplicity?

But let's check constraints.

We know:
- Position 1: C (fixed)
- A must be somewhere, but not position 4. In CACTI, A is at position 2 -> allowed.
- No R,N,E.

CACTI: letters used: C, A, T, I -> all not prohibited? R,N,E are prohibited, but T and I are new.

Another option: With A in position 3: C_A__

Words: COAST? but has O,S,T -> O and S? But COAST: C(1),O(2),A(3),S(4),T(5). But we don't know about O,S,T. However, COAST has O? And E is absent? But let's see: E is not in COAST, so okay? But the feedback doesn't say anything about O,S,T? But we must avoid R,N,E -> COAST doesn't have R,N,E? Actually, COAST: letters C,O,A,S,T -> no R,N,E -> okay.

But position: A is at position 3 -> so if we guess COAST, A is at position 3, which is a different position than in CRANE's A (position4). So that would be fine.

However, we don't know the position of A yet. Let me see: A could be in position 2,3, or5? Actually, position5: C____A -> words like CHINA? CHINA has H,I,N,A -> but N is absent! We cannot have N.

Similarly, MEDIA? but doesn't start with C.

So position5 is hard? Because words ending with A: like ULTRA, but not starting with C? Or CITRA? But CITRA? Maybe not common.

Common words: CHINA has N -> invalid.

So perhaps focus on position2 or 3.

CAULK: C(1),A(2),U(3),L(4),K(5) -> no R,N,E? Yes. Letters: C,A,U,L,K -> all new? And avoids R,N,E.

Similarly, CACTI: C,A,C,T,I -> T and I new.

COAST: C,O,A,S,T -> O,S,T new.

Now, to maximize information: we want to test several new letters? Our goal is to find the word quickly.

But note: we also know that the word contains A, so we need to include A in the guess and place it appropriately.

In our next guess, we should include A and avoid R,N,E, and use new letters to test.

Also, we know the word has exactly one C? Or possibly more? Unknown.

To test the position of A, we can try to put A in a different position.

Since in the first guess A was at position4 and was wrong, and we have positions 2,3,5 left. We can try putting A at position2 to see if it belongs there.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in a position we haven't tested? But that's positions2,3,5.

Let me list potential next guesses:

Option1: Place A in position2: CA___
Words: CABBY? not common? CADGY? obscure? CAULK (as above): valid word? CAULK: meaning sealant? Yes.

Option2: Place A in position3: C_A__
Words: COAST (if we want) -> but includes O,S,T. Or CHAFE? but has E -> skip. CHAMP? has M,P -> no R,N,E? CHAMP: letters C,H,A,M,P -> avoid R,N,E: yes.

CHAMP: C at 1? Yes. H? Possible.

COMA: too short.

COAST is common.

CLAMP? but L and M? and P? Then A at position3.

CLAMP: C(1),L(2),A(3),M(4),P(5) -> avoid R,N,E -> yes.

But note: we used 4 new letters? Hmm.

Option3: Place A at position5: C____A
Words: CIRCA? CIRCA has R? R is absent -> skip. CITRA? may not be common. COPRA? has R -> skip. COBRA? has R -> skip. CHELA? has H,E-> E is absent -> skip. 

So words ending in A without R,N,E are difficult? Examples: TACCA? not common. So perhaps avoid position5 for now.

Given that, let's decide between CAULK and COAST? or CHAMP? etc.

I want to test more common letters? Like S, T, etc.

Also, note: the letter A is present, so regardless of where we put it, we can get information.

But to disambiguate the position, maybe placing A in position2 is good? Or position3?

We can choose a word that places A in one position and has other common letters.

My thought: since we only know one correct letter (C at start) and one present letter (A), and three absent letters, we can choose a word that covers a lot of ground.

I recall that from CRANE, we know C is correct at first position, so next word should start with C.

I choose CAULK: C(1), A(2), U(3), L(4), K(5)

If A is in position2, then we might get a dash or even correct? But we don't know.

Alternatively, COAST: C(1), O(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)

But both are reasonable.

Another common word: CHAIR -> but has R? R is absent -> invalid.

SHIELD? doesn't start with C.

So with available constraints.

I think I'll go with COAST, as it has common letters O, S, T? And A at position3.

CAULK has U and L and K? Less common? But still valid.

To test S and T? Because S and T are very common.

Moreover, COAST avoids R,N,E -> yes.

So let me choose COAST.

But when we write the guess, we must use only valid letters.

So COAST: C, O, A, S, T.

Feedback will tell us about O, A, S, T.

A is at position3? So if the word has A at position3, we get A correct? Otherwise, if A is elsewhere, we might get dash or cross.

But note: we know A is in the word, so we must include A in this guess to learn.

In COAST, A is included.

Similarly, if I choose CAULK, A is at position2.

Now, the secret word has C at position1 and A somewhere in 2,3,5. If we choose COAST (with A at3), and if A is at2, we might get dash for A? And similarly.

But to maximize information, I should pick a word that uses many new letters.

CAULK uses U, L, K which are less common? So if they are absent, we get crosses? Then we know what's not there.

Alternatively, COAST uses O, S, T which are common? So if present, we get valuable info? But they might not be.

Since we have limited guesses, we have to balance.

But let's see: if COAST gives feedback:

If A is at position3, we might get A(✓). If not, then A(?) dash or x? But A is present, so at minimum dash? Because it must be in the word elsewhere.

Similarly, the other positions.

Another idea: We can choose a word that uses more vowels? But the word already has one vowel A? But we don't know? Since E is absent? So vowels are limited? Not necessarily.

Common vowels: A? We know A is present? E, I, O? We don't know. E is absent? So E is gone. But I and O might be present.

So COAST has O? Which is vowel.

Similarly, CAULK has U? Vowel.

Both have one vowel? O vs U? O is more common? So perhaps COAST better.

Given that, I'll pick COAST.

Guess: COAST

Format: we need to output in <guess> tag.

But note: our first guess was CRANE, now second guess.

But let me confirm: COAST is a valid word? Yes.

So new guess: COAST

Then feedback might help.

But note: we must ensure it doesn't have E? No. Letters: C,O,A,S,T -> no E.

And avoid R,N,E? Yes.

So I'll choose COAST.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C** is confirmed as the first letter and in the correct position (✓).
- **A** is in the word but not in the 4th position (-), so it must appear in position 2, 3, or 5.
- **R**, **N**, and **E** are not in the word (x).

The new guess must:
- Start with ""C"".
- Include ""A"" (in position 2, 3, or 5).
- Exclude the letters R, N, and E.
- Introduce new common letters to maximize information gain about the secret word.

Considering these constraints, a strong second guess is ""COAST"" because:
- It starts with ""C"" (position 1).
- Places ""A"" in position 3 to test a new location.
- Uses common letters like ""O"", ""S"", and ""T"" which haven't been tested yet.
- Avoids R, N, and E.
- COAST is a valid English word that helps probe the position of ""A"" and potentially reveal other correct letters or positions.

If ""A"" is in the correct spot (position 3) or present elsewhere, the feedback will clarify its position and the presence of O, S, or T. This sets up efficient deduction for the next guess.

So position5 is hard? Because words ending with A: like ULTRA, but not starting with C? Or CITRA? But CITRA? Maybe not common.

Common words: CHINA has N -> invalid.

So perhaps focus on position2 or 3.

CAULK: C(1),A(2),U(3),L(4),K(5) -> no R,N,E? Yes. Letters: C,A,U,L,K -> all new? And avoids R,N,E.

Similarly, CACTI: C,A,C,T,I -> T and I new.

COAST: C,O,A,S,T -> O,S,T new.

Now, to maximize information: we want to test several new letters? Our goal is to find the word quickly.

But note: we also know that the word contains A, so we need to include A in the guess and place it appropriately.

In our next guess, we should include A and avoid R,N,E, and use new letters to test.

Also, we know the word has exactly one C? Or possibly more? Unknown.

To test the position of A, we can try to put A in a different position.

Since in the first guess A was at position4 and was wrong, and we have positions 2,3,5 left. We can try putting A at position2 to see if it belongs there.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in a position we haven't tested? But that's positions2,3,5.

Let me list potential next guesses:

Option1: Place A in position2: CA___
Words: CABBY? not common? CADGY? obscure? CAULK (as above): valid word? CAULK: meaning sealant? Yes.

Option2: Place A in position3: C_A__
Words: COAST (if we want) -> but includes O,S,T. Or CHAFE? but has E -> skip. CHAMP? has M,P -> no R,N,E? CHAMP: letters C,H,A,M,P -> avoid R,N,E: yes.

CHAMP: C at 1? Yes. H? Possible.

COMA: too short.

COAST is common.

CLAMP? but L and M? and P? Then A at position3.

CLAMP: C(1),L(2),A(3),M(4),P(5) -> avoid R,N,E -> yes.

But note: we used 4 new letters? Hmm.

Option3: Place A at position5: C____A
Words: CIRCA? CIRCA has R? R is absent -> skip. CITRA? may not be common. COPRA? has R -> skip. COBRA? has R -> skip. CHELA? has H,E-> E is absent -> skip. 

So words ending in A without R,N,E are difficult? Examples: TACCA? not common. So perhaps avoid position5 for now.

Given that, let's decide between CAULK and COAST? or CHAMP? etc.

I want to test more common letters? Like S, T, etc.

Also, note: the letter A is present, so regardless of where we put it, we can get information.

But to disambiguate the position, maybe placing A in position2 is good? Or position3?

We can choose a word that places A in one position and has other common letters.

My thought: since we only know one correct letter (C at start) and one present letter (A), and three absent letters, we can choose a word that covers a lot of ground.

I recall that from CRANE, we know C is correct at first position, so next word should start with C.

I choose CAULK: C(1), A(2), U(3), L(4), K(5)

If A is in position2, then we might get a dash or even correct? But we don't know.

Alternatively, COAST: C(1), O(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)

But both are reasonable.

Another common word: CHAIR -> but has R? R is absent -> invalid.

SHIELD? doesn't start with C.

So with available constraints.

I think I'll go with COAST, as it has common letters O, S, T? And A at position3.

CAULK has U and L and K? Less common? But still valid.

To test S and T? Because S and T are very common.

Moreover, COAST avoids R,N,E -> yes.

So let me choose COAST.

But when we write the guess, we must use only valid letters.

So COAST: C, O, A, S, T.

Feedback will tell us about O, A, S, T.

A is at position3? So if the word has A at position3, we get A correct? Otherwise, if A is elsewhere, we might get dash or cross.

But note: we know A is in the word, so we must include A in this guess to learn.

In COAST, A is included.

Similarly, if I choose CAULK, A is at position2.

Now, the secret word has C at position1 and A somewhere in 2,3,5. If we choose COAST (with A at3), and if A is at2, we might get dash for A? And similarly.

But to maximize information, I should pick a word that uses many new letters.

CAULK uses U, L, K which are less common? So if they are absent, we get crosses? Then we know what's not there.

Alternatively, COAST uses O, S, T which are common? So if present, we get valuable info? But they might not be.

Since we have limited guesses, we have to balance.

But let's see: if COAST gives feedback:

If A is at position3, we might get A(✓). If not, then A(?) dash or x? But A is present, so at minimum dash? Because it must be in the word elsewhere.

Similarly, the other positions.

Another idea: We can choose a word that uses more vowels? But the word already has one vowel A? But we don't know? Since E is absent? So vowels are limited? Not necessarily.

Common vowels: A? We know A is present? E, I, O? We don't know. E is absent? So E is gone. But I and O might be present.

So COAST has O? Which is vowel.

Similarly, CAULK has U? Vowel.

Both have one vowel? O vs U? O is more common? So perhaps COAST better.

Given that, I'll pick COAST.

Guess: COAST

Format: we need to output in <guess> tag.

But note: our first guess was CRANE, now second guess.

But let me confirm: COAST is a valid word? Yes.

So new guess: COAST

Then feedback might help.

But note: we must ensure it doesn't have E? No. Letters: C,O,A,S,T -> no E.

- **A** is in the word but not in the 4th position (-), so it must appear in position 2, 3, or 5.
- **R**, **N**, and **E** are not in the word (x).

The new guess must:
- Start with ""C"".
- Include ""A"" (in position 2, 3, or 5).
- Exclude the letters R, N, and E.
- Introduce new common letters to maximize information gain about the secret word.

Considering these constraints, a strong second guess is ""COAST"" because:

- Places ""A"" in position 3 to test a new location.
- Uses common letters like ""O"", ""S"", and ""T"" which haven't been tested yet.
- Avoids R, N, and E.
- COAST is a valid English word that helps probe the position of ""A"" and potentially reveal other correct letters or positions.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We need to make the first guess. Since there's no prior information, we choose a word that has common letters and might help reveal the structure.
 A good starting word often has distinct letters and common vowels and consonants. Examples include words like ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", etc.
 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"". Let's consider that. But note: we can also use ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 However, let's pick ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
   - The letters are distinct, so we can get maximum information.

 So, we'll go with ""CRANE"".I need to make the first guess without any prior information. A strong starting word should include common English letters and maximize information gain. Ideally, it should contain frequently occurring vowels and consonants, and prioritize letters that appear in many words. 

After considering common starting words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", and ""ROAST"", I choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) which are highly common
- Uses important consonants (C, R, N) that frequently appear in 5-letter words
- All letters are distinct, providing maximum coverage
- Ranked among top starting words by Wordle strategy analyses

This guess will give clear feedback on these five letters and their positions, setting up a strong foundation for subsequent guesses regardless of the secret word.

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C** is confirmed as the first letter and in the correct position (✓).
- **A** is in the word but not in the 4th position (-), so it must appear in position 2, 3, or 5.
- **R**, **N**, and **E** are not in the word (x).

The new guess must:
- Start with ""C"".
- Include ""A"" (in position 2, 3, or 5).
- Exclude the letters R, N, and E.
- Introduce new common letters to maximize information gain about the secret word.

Considering these constraints, a strong second guess is ""COAST"" because:
- It starts with ""C"" (position 1).
- Places ""A"" in position 3 to test a new location.
- Uses common letters like ""O"", ""S"", and ""T"" which haven't been tested yet.
- Avoids R, N, and E.
- COAST is a valid English word that helps probe the position of ""A"" and potentially reveal other correct letters or positions.

If ""A"" is in the correct spot (position 3) or present elsewhere, the feedback will clarify its position and the presence of O, S, or T. This sets up efficient deduction for the next guess.

But the feedback for A was a single dash, meaning at least one A exists but misplaced, but there could be more? However, the feedback only shows the first occurrence? Actually, in Wordle rules, feedback is per instance. For CRANE, the A is at position 4 and got a dash, so there is at least one A elsewhere. But if the word had two A\'s, the dash would only appear for the A in position 4? And the rest might be marked? But let\'s not assume duplicates yet.\n\nActually, the feedback tells us:\n- For each guessed letter, what happens. If there are duplicate letters in the guess, it can be tricky, but here we don\'t have duplicates in CRANE.\n\nSo for now, we know one A is present and not in position 4.\n\nPossible words:\n\nList of common words starting with C:\n\n- With A in position 2: words like CABBY, CACTI, CADDY, CADET, CAFES, CAULK, CAVIL, ...\nBut avoid R,N,E.\n\nCADET: has E -> skip.\nCAFES: has E and S? But E is absent, so no.\nCACTI: letters: C,A,C,T,I -> but C is duplicated? However, our word may have duplicates? Possible. But note feedback: C was at position 1 and was correct, so if we write CACTI, the first C is same, but second C is new. But the secret word has at least one C at start? It might have more but in the feedback for CRANE only first C was given.\n\nBut the feedback showed only one C as correct. So if the word had two C\'s, and we guessed CRANE with only one C, the additional C in the word wouldn\'t be reflected. But the guess must be a valid word. So CACTI is a word. However, letters: C (at 1), A (at 2), C (at 3), T (at 4), I (at 5). But we have to avoid R,N,E and we are including T and I.\n\nBut note: the feedback doesn\'t prohibit T or I. Also, CACTI has two C\'s? The secret word might or might not have duplicates.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid duplicates for simplicity?\n\nBut let\'s check constraints.\n\nWe know:\n- Position 1: C (fixed)\n- A must be somewhere, but not position 4. In CACTI, A is at position 2 -> allowed.\n- No R,N,E.\n\nCACTI: letters used: C, A, T, I -> all not prohibited? R,N,E are prohibited, but T and I are new.\n\nAnother option: With A in position 3: C_A__\n\nWords: COAST? but has O,S,T -> O and S? But COAST: C(1),O(2),A(3),S(4),T(5). But we don\'t know about O,S,T. However, COAST has O? And E is absent? But let\'s see: E is not in COAST, so okay? But the feedback doesn\'t say anything about O,S,T? But we must avoid R,N,E -> COAST doesn\'t have R,N,E? Actually, COAST: letters C,O,A,S,T -> no R,N,E -> okay.\n\nBut position: A is at position 3 -> so if we guess COAST, A is at position 3, which is a different position than in CRANE\'s A (position4).

We are given the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
This means:
- The first letter is C (correct and in position).
- The letter A is in the word but not in the 4th position (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5).
- The letters R, N, and E are not in the word at all.

For the second guess:
- The word must start with C (position 1 is fixed as C).
- The word must include the letter A, but not in the 4th position (so we should try A in position 2, 3, or 5 to test).
- We must avoid using R, N, and E.

We want to choose a word that:
- Starts with C.
- Contains A in a new position (not position 4, and we haven't tested positions 2, 3, or 5 yet).
- Uses other common letters that we haven't tried (we haven't tried O, S, T, L, I, U, etc.).

Good candidate words:
- ""COAST"": C (position 1), O (new), A (position 3, which is a new position for A), S (new), T (new). This avoids R, N, E.
- ""CHAOS"": C, H (new), A (position 3), O, S. Also avoids R, N, E.
- ""CLASP"": C, L (new), A (position 3), S, P (new). Avoids R, N, E.

However, ""COAST"" is a very common word and tests three new common letters (O, S, T). It places A in position 3, which is one of the possible positions (2,3,5). If A is actually in position 2 or 5, we'll get a '-' for A and know its position is wrong, but we'll also get information about O, S, T.

Alternatively, we could try to put A in position 2 (like ""CAULK"") or position 5 (like ""CIVIC"" but that has repeated letters and we don't know about V). But ""COAST"" is a balanced choice.

Therefore, I choose ""COAST"" as the second guess.

Based on the feedback from ""CRANE"" (C✓, Rx, A-, Nx, Ex), the secret word starts with ""C"" and contains ""A"" (but not in position 4). ""R"", ""N"", and ""E"" are absent.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We need to make the first guess. Since there's no prior information, we choose a word that has common letters and might help reveal the structure.
 A good starting word often has distinct letters and common vowels and consonants. Examples include words like ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", etc.
 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"". Let's consider that. But note: we can also use ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 However, let's pick ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
   - The letters are distinct, so we can get maximum information.

 So, we'll go with ""CRANE"".I need to make the first guess without any prior information. A strong starting word should include common English letters and maximize information gain. Ideally, it should contain frequently occurring vowels and consonants, and prioritize letters that appear in many words. 

After considering common starting words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", and ""ROAST"", I choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) which are highly common
- Uses important consonants (C, R, N) that frequently appear in 5-letter words
- All letters are distinct, providing maximum coverage
- Ranked among top starting words by Wordle strategy analyses

This guess will give clear feedback on these five letters and their positions, setting up a strong foundation for subsequent guesses regardless of the secret word.

<｜Assistant｜>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C** is confirmed as the first letter and in the correct position (✓).
- **A** is in the word but not in the 4th position (-), so it must appear in position 2, 3, or 5.
- **R**, **N**, and **E** are not in the word (x).

The new guess must:
- Start with ""C"".
- Include ""A"" (in position 2, 3, or 5).
- Exclude the letters R, N, and E.
- Introduce new common letters to maximize information gain about the secret word.

Considering these constraints, a strong second guess is ""COAST"" because:
- It starts with ""C"" (position 1).
- Places ""A"" in position 3 to test a new location.
- Uses common letters like ""O"", ""S"", and ""T"" which haven't been tested yet.
- Avoids R, N, and E.
- COAST is a valid English word that helps probe the position of ""A"" and potentially reveal other correct letters or positions.

If ""A"" is in the correct spot (position 3) or present elsewhere, the feedback will clarify its position and the presence of O, S, or T. This sets up efficient deduction for the next guess.

Avoid R,N,E -> CABAL? but has A again? But we know A is already one letter. However, CABAL has A in two positions? But we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters. But the feedback for A was a single dash, meaning at least one A exists but misplaced, but there could be more? However, the feedback only shows the first occurrence? Actually, in Wordle rules, feedback is per instance. For CRANE, the A is at position 4 and got a dash, so there is at least one A elsewhere. But if the word had two A\'s, the dash would only appear for the A in position 4? And the rest might be marked? But let\'s not assume duplicates yet.\n\nActually, the feedback tells us:\n- For each guessed letter, what happens. If there are duplicate letters in the guess, it can be tricky, but here we don\'t have duplicates in CRANE.\n\nSo for now, we know one A is present and not in position 4.\n\nPossible words:\n\nList of common words starting with C:\n\n- With A in position 2: words like CABBY, CACTI, CADDY, CADET, CAFES, CAULK, CAVIL, ...\nBut avoid R,N,E.\n\nCADET: has E -> skip.\nCAFES: has E and S? But E is absent, so no.\nCACTI: letters: C,A,C,T,I -> but C is duplicated? However, our word may have duplicates? Possible. But note feedback: C was at position 1 and was correct, so if we write CACTI, the first C is same, but second C is new. But the secret word has at least one C at start? It might have more but in the feedback for CRANE only first C was given.\n\nBut the feedback showed only one C as correct. So if the word had two C\'s, and we guessed CRANE with only one C, the additional C in the word wouldn\'t be reflected. But the guess must be a valid word. So CACTI is a word. However, letters: C (at 1), A (at 2), C (at 3), T (at 4), I (at 5). But we have to avoid R,N,E and we are including T and I.\n\nBut note: the feedback doesn\'t prohibit T or I. Also, CACTI has two C\'s? The secret word might or might not have duplicates.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid duplicates for simplicity?\n\nBut let\'s check constraints.\n\nWe know:\n- Position 1: C (fixed)\n- A must be somewhere, but not position 4. In CACTI, A is at position 2 -> allowed.\n- No R,N,E.\n\nCACTI: letters used: C, A, T, I -> all not prohibited? R,N,E are prohibited, but T and I are new.\n\nAnother option: With A in position 3: C_A__\n\nWords: COAST? but has O,S,T -> O and S? But COAST: C(1),O(2),A(3),S(4),T(5). But we don\'t know about O,S,T. However, COAST has O? And E is absent? But let\'s see: E is not in COAST, so okay? But the feedback doesn\'t say anything about O,S,T? But we must avoid R,N,E -> COAST doesn\'t have R,N,E? Actually, COAST: letters C,O,A,S,T -> no R,N,E -> okay.\n\nBut position: A is at position 3 -> so if we guess COAST, A is at position 3, which is a different position than in CRANE\'s A (position4). So that would be fine.\n\nHowever, we don\'t know the position of A yet. Let me see: A could be in position 2,3, or5? Actually, position5: C____A -> words like CHINA? CHINA has H,I,N,A -> but N is absent! We cannot have N.\n\nSimilarly, MEDIA? but doesn\'t start with C.\n\nSo position5 is hard? Because words ending with A: like ULTRA, but not starting with C? Or CITRA? But CITRA? Maybe not common.\n\nCommon words: CHINA has N -> invalid.\n\nSo perhaps focus on position2 or 3.\n\nCAULK: C(1),A(2),U(3),L(4),K(5) -> no R,N,E? Yes. Letters: C,A,U,L,K -> all new? And avoids R,N,E.\n\nSimilarly, CACTI: C,A,C,T,I -> T and I new.\n\nCOAST: C,O,A,S,T -> O,S,T new.\n\nNow, to maximize information: we want to test several new letters? Our goal is to find the word quickly.\n\nBut note: we also know that the word contains A, so we need to include A in the guess and place it appropriately.\n\nIn our next guess, we should include A and avoid R,N,E, and use new letters to test.\n\nAlso, we know the word has exactly one C? Or possibly more? Unknown.\n\nTo test the position of A, we can try to put A in a different position.\n\nSince in the first guess A was at position4 and was wrong, and we have positions 2,3,5 left. We can try putting A at position2 to see if it belongs there.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has A in a position we haven\'t tested? But that\'s positions2,3,5.\n\nLet me list potential next guesses:\n\nOption1: Place A in position2: CA___\nWords: CABBY? not common? CADGY? obscure? CAULK (as above): valid word? CAULK: meaning sealant? Yes.\n\nOption2: Place A in position3: C_A__\nWords: COAST (if we want) -> but includes O,S,T. Or CHAFE? but has E -> skip. CHAMP? has M,P -> no R,N,E? CHAMP: letters C,H,A,M,P -> avoid R,N,E: yes.\n\nCHAMP: C at 1? Yes. H? Possible.\n\nCOMA: too short.\n\nCOAST is common.\n\nCLAMP? but L and M? and P? Then A at position3.\n\nCLAMP: C(1),L(2),A(3),M(4),P(5) -> avoid R,N,E -> yes.\n\nBut note: we used 4 new letters? Hmm.\n\nOption3: Place A at position5: C____A\nWords: CIRCA? CIRCA has R? R is absent -> skip. CITRA? may not be common. COPRA? has R -> skip. COBRA? has R -> skip. CHELA? has H,E-> E is absent -> skip. \n\nSo words ending in A without R,N,E are difficult? Examples: TACCA? not common. So perhaps avoid position5 for now.\n\nGiven that, let\'s decide between CAULK and COAST? or CHAMP? etc.\n\nI want to test more common letters? Like S, T, etc.\n\nAlso, note: the letter A is present, so regardless of where we put it, we can get information.\n\nBut to disambiguate the position, maybe placing A in position2 is good? Or position3?\n\nWe can choose a word that places A in one position and has other common letters.\n\nMy thought: since we only know one correct letter (C at start) and one present letter (A), and three absent letters, we can choose a word that covers a lot of ground.\n\nI recall that from CRANE, we know C is correct at first position, so next word should start with C.\n\nI choose CAULK: C(1), A(2), U(3), L(4), K(5)\n\nIf A is in position2, then we might get a dash or even correct? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, COAST: C(1), O(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)\n\nBut both are reasonable.\n\nAnother common word: CHAIR -> but has R? R is absent -> invalid.\n\nSHIELD? doesn\'t start with C.\n\nSo with available constraints.\n\nI think I\'ll go with COAST, as it has common letters O, S, T? And A at position3.\n\nCAULK has U and L and K? Less common? But still valid.\n\nTo test S and T? Because S and T are very common.\n\nMoreover, COAST avoids R,N,E -> yes.\n\nSo let me choose COAST.\n\nBut when we write the guess, we must use only valid letters.\n\nSo COAST: C, O, A, S, T.\n\nFeedback will tell us about O, A, S, T.\n\nA is at position3? So if the word has A at position3, we get A correct? Otherwise, if A is elsewhere, we might get dash or cross.\n\nBut note: we know A is in the word, so we must include A in this guess to learn.\n\nIn COAST, A is included.\n\nSimilarly, if I choose CAULK, A is at position2.\n\nNow, the secret word has C at position1 and A somewhere in 2,3,5. If we choose COAST (with A at3), and if A is at2, we might get dash for A? And similarly.\n\nBut to maximize information, I should pick a word that uses many new letters.\n\nCAULK uses U, L, K which are less common? So if they are absent, we get crosses? Then we know what\'s not there.\n\nAlternatively, COAST uses O, S, T which are common? So if present, we get valuable info? But they might not be.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we have to balance.\n\nBut let\'s see: if COAST gives feedback:\n\nIf A is at position3, we might get A(✓). If not, then A(?) dash or x? But A is present, so at minimum dash? Because it must be in the word elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly, the other positions.\n\nAnother idea: We can choose a word that uses more vowels? But the word already has one vowel A? But we don\'t know? Since E is absent? So vowels are limited? Not necessarily.\n\nCommon vowels: A? We know A is present? E, I, O? We don\'t know. E is absent? So E is gone. But I and O might be present.\n\nSo COAST has O? Which is vowel.\n\nSimilarly, CAULK has U? Vowel.\n\nBoth have one vowel? O vs U? O is more common? So perhaps COAST better.\n\nGiven that, I\'ll pick COAST.\n\nGuess: COAST\n\nFormat: we need to output in <guess> tag.\n\nBut note: our first guess was CRANE, now second guess.\n\nBut let me confirm: COAST is a valid word? Yes.\n\nSo new guess: COAST\n\nThen feedback might help.\n\nBut note: we must ensure it doesn\'t have E? No. Letters: C,O,A,S,T -> no E.\n\nAnd avoid R,N,E?

We have the following feedback:
- Guess 1: CRANE → C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
- Guess 2: COAST → C(✓) O(x) A(-) S(x) T(x)

From this, we deduce:
1. First letter is C (confirmed twice).
2. A is in the word but not in position 4 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 (from COAST). Since it was misplaced in both guesses (position 4 and 3), it must be in position 2 or 5.
3. Eliminated letters: R, N, E (from CRANE), O, S, T (from COAST). So forbidden letters: R, N, E, O, S, T.
4. Known present letter: A (twice confirmed as present, just not in position 3 or 4).

Secret word constraints:
- Starts with C.
- Contains A in position 2 or 5.
- Does NOT contain R, N, E, O, S, T.
- Must be a 5-letter English word.

Our next guess must:
- Start with ""C"".
- Include ""A"" in position 2 or 5 (since positions 3 and 4 are invalid for A).
- Use only remaining common letters (e.g., L, I, P, U, M, B, D, G, etc., avoiding eliminated ones).
- Ideally, test position 2 and 5 for A and introduce new high-frequency letters.

Given A must be in position 2 or 5, we consider two cases:
- If A is in position 2: Possible words like ""CABIN"", ""CIVIC"", ""CAPUT"", but must avoid eliminated letters.
- If A is in position 5: Possible words like ""MUCRA"" (but starts with M, not C), ""CULPA"" (has U,L,P), etc.

Since R,N,E,O,S,T are eliminated, available letters include: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, etc.

Strong candidates:
- Test A in position 2: ""CHAMP"" (C, H, A, M, P) → M and P are common.
- Test A in position 5: ""CUMIN"" → but N is eliminated; ""CURIA"" → R is eliminated; ""CULPA"" → U,L,P not tested.

We prioritize testing A in position 2 first because:
- It's earlier and might resolve A's position faster.
- Position 5 words are harder to form with remaining letters.

Choose ""CHAMP"":
- Starts with C.
- Puts A in position 2 (tests if A is correctly placed there).
- Introduces new letters: H (position 2 isn't being tested directly because A is there, but H is position 3), M (4), P (5).
- Avoids eliminated letters: R,N,E,O,S,T.

If A is in position 2, we'll get A(✓). If not, it must be in position 5 (and we'll get A(-)), narrowing down.

Other options like ""CLAMP"" (uses L and M) or ""CAMPY"" (Y) are possible, but ""CHAMP"" is a common word.

1. **Position 1:** Confirmed as **C** (from both CRANE and COAST).
2. **Letter A:** Present in the word but:
   - Not in position 4 (from CRANE feedback: A(-)).
   - Not in position 3 (from COAST feedback: A(-)).
   - Therefore, **A must be in position 2 or 5**.
3. **Eliminated Letters:** R, N, E, O, S, T (all marked ""x"" in guesses).
4. **New Letters to Test:** Focus on common unused letters (e.g., L, I, P, U, M, B, D, G, H).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Start with **C**.
- Test **A** in position **2** (to confirm/disprove if it belongs there).
- Introduce new high-frequency letters to uncover more of the word.
- Avoid eliminated letters (R,N,E,O,S,T).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We need to make the first guess. Since there's no prior information, we choose a word that has common letters and might help reveal the structure.
 A good starting word often has distinct letters and common vowels and consonants. Examples include words like ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", etc.
 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"". Let's consider that. But note: we can also use ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 However, let's pick ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
   - The letters are distinct, so we can get maximum information.

 So, we'll go with ""CRANE"".I need to make the first guess without any prior information. A strong starting word should include common English letters and maximize information gain. Ideally, it should contain frequently occurring vowels and consonants, and prioritize letters that appear in many words. 

After considering common starting words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", and ""ROAST"", I choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) which are highly common
- Uses important consonants (C, R, N) that frequently appear in 5-letter words
- All letters are distinct, providing maximum coverage
- Ranked among top starting words by Wordle strategy analyses

This guess will give clear feedback on these five letters and their positions, setting up a strong foundation for subsequent guesses regardless of the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C** is confirmed as the first letter and in the correct position (✓).
- **A** is in the word but not in the 4th position (-), so it must appear in position 2, 3, or 5.
- **R**, **N**, and **E** are not in the word (x).

The new guess must:
- Start with ""C"".
- Include ""A"" (in position 2, 3, or 5).
- Exclude the letters R, N, and E.
- Introduce new common letters to maximize information gain about the secret word.

Considering these constraints, a strong second guess is ""COAST"" because:
- It starts with ""C"" (position 1).
- Places ""A"" in position 3 to test a new location.
- Uses common letters like ""O"", ""S"", and ""T"" which haven't been tested yet.
- Avoids R, N, and E.
- COAST is a valid English word that helps probe the position of ""A"" and potentially reveal other correct letters or positions.

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C** is confirmed as the first letter and in the correct position (✓).
- **A** is in the word but not in the 4th position (-), so it must appear in position 2, 3, or 5.
- **R**, **N**, and **E** are not in the word (x).

The new guess must:
- Start with ""C"".
- Include ""A"" (in position 2, 3, or 5).
- Exclude the letters R, N, and E.
- Introduce new common letters to maximize information gain about the secret word.

Considering these constraints, a strong second guess is ""COAST"" because:
- It starts with ""C"" (position 1).
- Places ""A"" in position 3 to test a new location.
- Uses common letters like ""O"", ""S"", and ""T"" which haven't been tested yet.
- Avoids R, N, and E.
- COAST is a valid English word that helps probe the position of ""A"" and potentially reveal other correct letters or positions.

If ""A"" is in the correct spot (position 3) or present elsewhere, the feedback will clarify its position and the presence of O, S, or T. This sets up efficient deduction for the next guess.

<guess>COAST -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
This means:
- The first letter is C (correct and in position).
- The letter A is in the word but not in the 4th position (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5).
- The letters R, N, and E are not in the word at all.

For the second guess:
- The word must start with C (position 1 is fixed as C).
- The word must include the letter A, but not in the 4th position (so we should try A in position 2, 3, or 5 to test).
- We must avoid using R, N, and E.

We want to choose a word that:
- Starts with C.
- Contains A in a new position (not position 4, and we haven't tested positions 2, 3, or 5 yet).
- Uses other common letters that we haven't tried (we haven't tried O, S, T, L, I, U, etc.).

Good candidate words:
- ""COAST"": C (position 1), O (new), A (position 3, which is a new position for A), S (new), T (new). This avoids R, N, E.
- ""CHAOS"": C, H (new), A (position 3), O, S. Also avoids R, N, E.
- ""CLASP"": C, L (new), A (position 3), S, P (new). Avoids R, N, E.

However, ""COAST"" is a very common word and tests three new common letters (O, S, T). It places A in position 3, which is one of the possible positions (2,3,5). If A is actually in position 2 or 5, we'll get a '-' for A and know its position is wrong, but we'll also get information about O, S, T.

Alternatively, we could try to put A in position 2 (like ""CAULK"") or position 5 (like ""CIVIC"" but that has repeated letters and we don't know about V). But ""COAST"" is a balanced choice.

Therefore, I choose ""COAST"" as the second guess.

<guess>COAST</guess>Based on the feedback from ""CRANE"" (C✓, Rx, A-, Nx, Ex), the secret word starts with ""C"" and contains ""A"" (but not in position 4). ""R"", ""N"", and ""E"" are absent. 

For the new guess:
- Must start with ""C"" (position 1 fixed).
- Must include ""A"" in position 2, 3, or 5 (since position 4 is invalid).
- Should avoid ""R"", ""N"", ""E"" and test new common letters.

**Selected Guess: COAST**  
- Starts with ""C"" (tests position 1 again, though already confirmed).
- Places ""A"" in position 3 (a new position to validate).
- Introduces ""O"", ""S"", ""T"" (high-frequency untested letters).
- Avoids forbidden letters (R, N, E).

This maximizes information: if ""A"" is correct in position 3, we'll get ✓; if not, we'll learn if ""O"", ""S"", or ""T"" exist in the word.

<guess>COAST -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 3: COAST -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) A(-) S(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback:
- Guess 1: CRANE → C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
- Guess 2: COAST → C(✓) O(x) A(-) S(x) T(x)

From this, we deduce:
1. First letter is C (confirmed twice).
2. A is in the word but not in position 4 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 (from COAST). Since it was misplaced in both guesses (position 4 and 3), it must be in position 2 or 5.
3. Eliminated letters: R, N, E (from CRANE), O, S, T (from COAST). So forbidden letters: R, N, E, O, S, T.
4. Known present letter: A (twice confirmed as present, just not in position 3 or 4).

Secret word constraints:
- Starts with C.
- Contains A in position 2 or 5.
- Does NOT contain R, N, E, O, S, T.
- Must be a 5-letter English word.

Our next guess must:
- Start with ""C"".
- Include ""A"" in position 2 or 5 (since positions 3 and 4 are invalid for A).
- Use only remaining common letters (e.g., L, I, P, U, M, B, D, G, etc., avoiding eliminated ones).
- Ideally, test position 2 and 5 for A and introduce new high-frequency letters.

Given A must be in position 2 or 5, we consider two cases:
- If A is in position 2: Possible words like ""CABIN"", ""CIVIC"", ""CAPUT"", but must avoid eliminated letters.
- If A is in position 5: Possible words like ""MUCRA"" (but starts with M, not C), ""CULPA"" (has U,L,P), etc.

Since R,N,E,O,S,T are eliminated, available letters include: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, etc.

Strong candidates:
- Test A in position 2: ""CHAMP"" (C, H, A, M, P) → M and P are common.
- Test A in position 5: ""CUMIN"" → but N is eliminated; ""CURIA"" → R is eliminated; ""CULPA"" → U,L,P not tested.

We prioritize testing A in position 2 first because:
- It's earlier and might resolve A's position faster.
- Position 5 words are harder to form with remaining letters.

Choose ""CHAMP"":
- Starts with C.
- Puts A in position 2 (tests if A is correctly placed there).
- Introduces new letters: H (position 2 isn't being tested directly because A is there, but H is position 3), M (4), P (5).
- Avoids eliminated letters: R,N,E,O,S,T.

If A is in position 2, we'll get A(✓). If not, it must be in position 5 (and we'll get A(-)), narrowing down.

Other options like ""CLAMP"" (uses L and M) or ""CAMPY"" (Y) are possible, but ""CHAMP"" is a common word.

Final decision: ""CHAMP""

<guess>CHAMP</guess>Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:

### Key Deductions:
1. **Position 1:** Confirmed as **C** (from both CRANE and COAST).
2. **Letter A:** Present in the word but:
   - Not in position 4 (from CRANE feedback: A(-)).
   - Not in position 3 (from COAST feedback: A(-)).
   - Therefore, **A must be in position 2 or 5**.
3. **Eliminated Letters:** R, N, E, O, S, T (all marked ""x"" in guesses).
4. **New Letters to Test:** Focus on common unused letters (e.g., L, I, P, U, M, B, D, G, H).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Start with **C**.
- Test **A** in position **2** (to confirm/disprove if it belongs there).
- Introduce new high-frequency letters to uncover more of the word.
- Avoid eliminated letters (R,N,E,O,S,T).

### Selected Guess: CHAMP
- **C** in position 1 (known correct).
- **A** in position 2 (tests if A is correctly placed here).
- **H**, **M**, **P**: New common letters not yet tested.
- Valid English word that fits constraints.

### Expected Insights:
- If **A** is ✓ in position 2, we solve one more position and focus on H, M, P.
- If **A** is -, we know it must be in position 5 (and H/M/P feedback will reveal if they exist in other positions).

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for the secret word.

Avoid R,N,E -> CABAL? but has A again? But we know A is already one letter. However, CABAL has A in two positions? But we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters. But the feedback for A was a single dash, meaning at least one A exists but misplaced, but there could be more? However, the feedback only shows the first occurrence? Actually, in Wordle rules, feedback is per instance. For CRANE, the A is at position 4 and got a dash, so there is at least one A elsewhere. But if the word had two A\'s, the dash would only appear for the A in position 4? And the rest might be marked? But let\'s not assume duplicates yet.\n\nActually, the feedback tells us:\n- For each guessed letter, what happens. If there are duplicate letters in the guess, it can be tricky, but here we don\'t have duplicates in CRANE.\n\nSo for now, we know one A is present and not in position 4.\n\nPossible words:\n\nList of common words starting with C:\n\n- With A in position 2: words like CABBY, CACTI, CADDY, CADET, CAFES, CAULK, CAVIL, ...\nBut avoid R,N,E.\n\nCADET: has E -> skip.\nCAFES: has E and S? But E is absent, so no.\nCACTI: letters: C,A,C,T,I -> but C is duplicated? However, our word may have duplicates? Possible. But note feedback: C was at position 1 and was correct, so if we write CACTI, the first C is same, but second C is new. But the secret word has at least one C at start? It might have more but in the feedback for CRANE only first C was given.\n\nBut the feedback showed only one C as correct. So if the word had two C\'s, and we guessed CRANE with only one C, the additional C in the word wouldn\'t be reflected. But the guess must be a valid word. So CACTI is a word. However, letters: C (at 1), A (at 2), C (at 3), T (at 4), I (at 5). But we have to avoid R,N,E and we are including T and I.\n\nBut note: the feedback doesn\'t prohibit T or I. Also, CACTI has two C\'s? The secret word might or might not have duplicates.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid duplicates for simplicity?\n\nBut let\'s check constraints.\n\nWe know:\n- Position 1: C (fixed)\n- A must be somewhere, but not position 4. In CACTI, A is at position 2 -> allowed.\n- No R,N,E.\n\nCACTI: letters used: C, A, T, I -> all not prohibited? R,N,E are prohibited, but T and I are new.\n\nAnother option: With A in position 3: C_A__\n\nWords: COAST? but has O,S,T -> O and S? But COAST: C(1),O(2),A(3),S(4),T(5). But we don\'t know about O,S,T. However, COAST has O? And E is absent? But let\'s see: E is not in COAST, so okay? But the feedback doesn\'t say anything about O,S,T? But we must avoid R,N,E -> COAST doesn\'t have R,N,E? Actually, COAST: letters C,O,A,S,T -> no R,N,E -> okay.\n\nBut position: A is at position 3 -> so if we guess COAST, A is at position 3, which is a different position than in CRANE\'s A (position4). So that would be fine.\n\nHowever, we don\'t know the position of A yet. Let me see: A could be in position 2,3, or5? Actually, position5: C____A -> words like CHINA? CHINA has H,I,N,A -> but N is absent! We cannot have N.\n\nSimilarly, MEDIA? but doesn\'t start with C.\n\nSo position5 is hard? Because words ending with A: like ULTRA, but not starting with C? Or CITRA? But CITRA? Maybe not common.\n\nCommon words: CHINA has N -> invalid.\n\nSo perhaps focus on position2 or 3.\n\nCAULK: C(1),A(2),U(3),L(4),K(5) -> no R,N,E? Yes. Letters: C,A,U,L,K -> all new? And avoids R,N,E.\n\nSimilarly, CACTI: C,A,C,T,I -> T and I new.\n\nCOAST: C,O,A,S,T -> O,S,T new.\n\nNow, to maximize information: we want to test several new letters? Our goal is to find the word quickly.\n\nBut note: we also know that the word contains A, so we need to include A in the guess and place it appropriately.\n\nIn our next guess, we should include A and avoid R,N,E, and use new letters to test.\n\nAlso, we know the word has exactly one C? Or possibly more? Unknown.\n\nTo test the position of A, we can try to put A in a different position.\n\nSince in the first guess A was at position4 and was wrong, and we have positions 2,3,5 left. We can try putting A at position2 to see if it belongs there.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has A in a position we haven\'t tested? But that\'s positions2,3,5.\n\nLet me list potential next guesses:\n\nOption1: Place A in position2: CA___\nWords: CABBY? not common? CADGY? obscure? CAULK (as above): valid word? CAULK: meaning sealant? Yes.\n\nOption2: Place A in position3: C_A__\nWords: COAST (if we want) -> but includes O,S,T. Or CHAFE? but has E -> skip. CHAMP? has M,P -> no R,N,E? CHAMP: letters C,H,A,M,P -> avoid R,N,E: yes.\n\nCHAMP: C at 1? Yes. H? Possible.\n\nCOMA: too short.\n\nCOAST is common.\n\nCLAMP? but L and M? and P? Then A at position3.\n\nCLAMP: C(1),L(2),A(3),M(4),P(5) -> avoid R,N,E -> yes.\n\nBut note: we used 4 new letters? Hmm.\n\nOption3: Place A at position5: C____A\nWords: CIRCA? CIRCA has R? R is absent -> skip. CITRA? may not be common. COPRA? has R -> skip. COBRA? has R -> skip. CHELA? has H,E-> E is absent -> skip. \n\nSo words ending in A without R,N,E are difficult? Examples: TACCA? not common. So perhaps avoid position5 for now.\n\nGiven that, let\'s decide between CAULK and COAST? or CHAMP? etc.\n\nI want to test more common letters? Like S, T, etc.\n\nAlso, note: the letter A is present, so regardless of where we put it, we can get information.\n\nBut to disambiguate the position, maybe placing A in position2 is good? Or position3?\n\nWe can choose a word that places A in one position and has other common letters.\n\nMy thought: since we only know one correct letter (C at start) and one present letter (A), and three absent letters, we can choose a word that covers a lot of ground.\n\nI recall that from CRANE, we know C is correct at first position, so next word should start with C.\n\nI choose CAULK: C(1), A(2), U(3), L(4), K(5)\n\nIf A is in position2, then we might get a dash or even correct? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, COAST: C(1), O(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)\n\nBut both are reasonable.\n\nAnother common word: CHAIR -> but has R? R is absent -> invalid.\n\nSHIELD? doesn\'t start with C.\n\nSo with available constraints.\n\nI think I\'ll go with COAST, as it has common letters O, S, T? And A at position3.\n\nCAULK has U and L and K? Less common? But still valid.\n\nTo test S and T? Because S and T are very common.\n\nMoreover, COAST avoids R,N,E -> yes.\n\nSo let me choose COAST.\n\nBut when we write the guess, we must use only valid letters.\n\nSo COAST: C, O, A, S, T.\n\nFeedback will tell us about O, A, S, T.\n\nA is at position3? So if the word has A at position3, we get A correct? Otherwise, if A is elsewhere, we might get dash or cross.\n\nBut note: we know A is in the word, so we must include A in this guess to learn.\n\nIn COAST, A is included.\n\nSimilarly, if I choose CAULK, A is at position2.\n\nNow, the secret word has C at position1 and A somewhere in 2,3,5. If we choose COAST (with A at3), and if A is at2, we might get dash for A? And similarly.\n\nBut to maximize information, I should pick a word that uses many new letters.\n\nCAULK uses U, L, K which are less common? So if they are absent, we get crosses? Then we know what\'s not there.\n\nAlternatively, COAST uses O, S, T which are common? So if present, we get valuable info? But they might not be.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we have to balance.\n\nBut let\'s see: if COAST gives feedback:\n\nIf A is at position3, we might get A(✓). If not, then A(?) dash or x? But A is present, so at minimum dash? Because it must be in the word elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly, the other positions.\n\nAnother idea: We can choose a word that uses more vowels? But the word already has one vowel A? But we don\'t know? Since E is absent? So vowels are limited? Not necessarily.\n\nCommon vowels: A? We know A is present? E, I, O? We don\'t know. E is absent? So E is gone. But I and O might be present.\n\nSo COAST has O? Which is vowel.\n\nSimilarly, CAULK has U? Vowel.\n\nBoth have one vowel? O vs U? O is more common? So perhaps COAST better.\n\nGiven that, I\'ll pick COAST.\n\nGuess: COAST\n\nFormat: we need to output in <guess> tag.\n\nBut note: our first guess was CRANE, now second guess.\n\nBut let me confirm: COAST is a valid word?

We have the following feedback history:
- Guess 1: CRANE → C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
- Guess 2: COAST → C(✓) O(x) A(-) S(x) T(x)
- Guess 3: CHAMP → C(✓) H(x) A(-) M(x) P(x)

From this, we can deduce:
1. **Position 1 is C**: Confirmed in all three guesses.
2. **Letter A is in the word but misplaced**:
   - From CRANE: A not in position 4.
   - From COAST: A not in position 3.
   - From CHAMP: A not in position 2.
   - Therefore, **A must be in position 5** (the only remaining possibility).
3. **Eliminated letters**: 
   - R, N, E (from CRANE), 
   - O, S, T (from COAST), 
   - H, M, P (from CHAMP).
   - Total eliminated: R, N, E, O, S, T, H, M, P.
4. **Available letters**: All letters except the eliminated ones. Common unused letters include B, D, F, G, I, K, L, U, V, W, Y, etc.
5. **Word structure**: 
   - Position 1: C (fixed)
   - Position 5: A (must be, as deduced)
   - Positions 2, 3, 4: Unknown letters from the available set.

The secret word is C _ _ _ A, and the middle three letters must be filled with letters not in the eliminated set.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with C.
- Ends with A.
- Uses only letters not eliminated (avoid R,N,E,O,S,T,H,M,P).
- Tests new common letters to maximize information.

Possible candidates:
- **C** + [new letters] + **A**
- Common words fitting this pattern: 
  - ""CANDY"" → but N is eliminated (from CRANE: N(x)).
  - ""CABIN"" → B and I are new, but N is eliminated.
  - ""CAULK"" → U, L, K are new and available.
  - ""CIVIL"" → V, I, L are new, but I and L are available.
  - ""CYNIC"" → Y, N, I → N is eliminated, so invalid.
  - ""FOCAL"" → but O is eliminated and doesn't start with C? No, must start with C.

After filtering, strong options:
- **CAULK**: C, A (position 5), U, L, K. All letters are new and available.
- **CIVIC**: C, I, V, I, C → repeated I and C, but C is already known. However, it tests I and V. But note: position 5 is A, not C, so ""CIVIC"" doesn't end with A. Invalid.
- **COLZA**: O is eliminated, invalid.
- **CUPPA"": P is eliminated, invalid.

Thus, ""CAULK"" is a good choice:
- Tests U in position 2, L in position 3, K in position 4.
- All letters are high-frequency and untested.

Alternative: ""CABAL"" → B and L, but A is in position 3 (we know A must be in position 5, so this would be invalid structure). We must have A in position 5.

Another option: ""CEDAR"" → E and R eliminated, invalid.

So, ""CAULK"" is a valid and strategic guess.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
  → **C** is correct and in position 1. **A** is in the word but not in position 4. **R, N, E** are absent.
- **Guess 2 (COAST)**: C(✓) O(x) A(-) S(x) T(x)  
  → **C** confirmed again. **A** is not in position 3. **O, S, T** are absent.
- **Guess 3 (CHAMP)**: C(✓) H(x) A(-) M(x) P(x)  
  → **C** confirmed. **A** is not in position 2. **H, M, P** are absent.

### Key Deductions:
1. **Position 1 is C** (confirmed in all guesses).
2. **A must be in position 5**:  
   - A is in the word but not in position 2 (from CHAMP), 3 (from COAST), or 4 (from CRANE). Position 5 is the only possibility left.
3. **Eliminated Letters**: R, N, E, O, S, T, H, M, P (all marked ""x"").
4. **Available Letters**: All letters not eliminated (e.g., B, D, F, G, I, K, L, U, V, W, Y, etc.).
5. **Word Structure**: The secret word is **C _ _ _ A** (positions 2, 3, 4 unknown).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Must start with C and end with A**.
- Use **new, common letters** for positions 2, 3, and 4 to maximize information.
- Avoid eliminated letters (R,N,E,O,S,T,H,M,P).

- **C** in position 1 (known correct).
- **A** in position 5 (testing the deduced position).
- **U, L, K** in positions 2, 3, 4 (new high-frequency letters not tested yet).
- Valid English word (meaning: a waterproof filler).

### Why This Guess?
- If **A** is ✓ in position 5, it confirms our deduction.
- **U, L, K** test three new letters—feedback will reveal if they exist in the word and their positions.
- Eliminates 3 more common letters if incorrect, narrowing possibilities significantly.
