We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.
 Also, including at least two vowels is helpful.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. 
 - C and R are common consonants.
 - A and E are common vowels.
 - N is also a common consonant.

 This word covers 5 distinct letters and is a good starting point.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback on our first guess ""CRANE"":
 C(✓) -> C is in the correct position.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word at all.
 A(-) -> A is in the word but in the wrong position.
 N(x) -> N is not in the word.
 E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So, what we know:
 1. The first letter is C.
 2. The word does not contain R or N.
 3. The word contains A and E, but not in the positions they were in the first guess.
    In ""CRANE"", A was in position 3 and E in position 5. Since they are present but wrong position, 
    A cannot be in position 3 and E cannot be in position 5.

 Also, since R and N are absent, we must avoid them in the next guess.

 We also know the secret word is 5 letters and must include:
   - C at the start (position 1)
   - A somewhere but not at position 3
   - E somewhere but not at position 5

 Now, let's think about possibilities:

 We know: 
   Position 1: C [fixed]
   Position 2: ? (cannot be R, and we know R is not in the word) 
   Position 3: ? (cannot be A, because A is not in position 3) and cannot be R or N
   Position 4: ? (cannot be R or N)
   Position 5: ? (cannot be E, and cannot be R or N)

 Since A and E must appear and we already have C at position 1, we need to form a word that fits.

 Let me try to think of words starting with C that contain A and E, but no R, N.

 Also note: we have eliminated R and N, so they are not in the word.

 Possible letters: We should consider common letters that haven't been tried: L, T, S, D, O, U, M, P, etc.

 We can try to put A and E in different positions.

 Where can A be? Not position 3. So positions: 2, 4, or 5? 
 But remember: position 5 cannot be E, but it can be A? Yes, because the feedback only said E is in the word but not at 5, it didn't say anything about A at 5. 
 However, we also know that A cannot be at position 3.

 Similarly, E can be at positions: 2, 3, or 4? Not 5? Actually, E is not at position 5, so can be at 1? But position 1 is C. So E can be at 2, 3, or 4.

 But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but let's assume none until we see feedback about duplicates.

 We'll try to form a word that fits:

 Consider: 
   Position 1: C
   Position 2: ? (we want to try a letter that might be common and that we can test along with A and E)

 Let me try putting A at position 2? Is that possible? Actually, we don't know but let's avoid it for now because we might want to use the feedback to test multiple positions.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has A and E in different positions to narrow down.

 Let me list some words starting with C that have A and E and exclude R and N.

 Some possibilities:
   CABLE: C, A, B, L, E -> 
      Positions: C at 1 (good), A at 2 (is that okay? we don't know yet about A), B, L, E at 5 -> but E at position 5 is not allowed per feedback? 
      Feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot have E at 5. Therefore, CABLE is invalid because E is at 5.

   CACHE: has duplicate C? It has C at 1 already. Then A at 2? But then we have C at 1 and another C at 3? The word has two Cs. 
      However, we don't know if the secret word has duplicate C? Our feedback so far: only one C was at the start and it was correct. 
      The feedback for C was (✓) meaning that one C at position 1 is correct. But what if there is another C? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters explicitly? 
      Actually, the feedback format: for each letter, we get a symbol. If we guess duplicate letters, then it will mark each occurrence appropriately.

      But in our last guess ""CRANE"", we had only one C. The feedback said C was correct. So if the word had two Cs, then the second C is not accounted for? 
      We don't know. So it's risky to guess duplicates? But that's part of the strategy.

   How about ""CAUSE""? 
      Position: C, A, U, S, E -> E is at position 5? But feedback says E cannot be at 5 -> invalid.

   How about ""CASTE""? 
      C, A, S, T, E -> E at position 5 -> invalid.

   We need E not in position 5.

   How about ""CLEAR""? 
      C, L, E, A, R -> but R is in the word? We have eliminated R (feedback said R is absent). Therefore, ""CLEAR"" has R -> invalid.

   We must avoid R and N.

   How about ""CHASE""? 
      C, H, A, S, E -> E at 5 -> invalid.

   How about ""CLEAT""? 
      C, L, E, A, T -> 
        Positions: 
          1: C (fixed)
          2: L 
          3: E -> We know E can be at position 3? Because feedback from first guess only forbade E at 5. So yes.
          4: A -> We know A cannot be at position 3? But at position 4 is allowed. 
          5: T

        This word has A at position 4 -> okay because originally it was at 3? Now it's at 4, which is different. 
        And E at position 3 -> okay because we don't have any feedback that E is not at 3? Only that it's not at 5.

        Also, no R and no N? Yes. 

        So ""CLEAT"" is a candidate.

   But note: we also have A? We are putting A at position 4. We need to check if that conflicts? We only know A is not in position 3. Position 4 is fine.

   Another candidate: ""CAMEL"": C, M, E at 3? But then A at position 2? 
        Position 1: C
        Position 2: A -> but we don't know if A can be at 2? It could be.
        Position 3: M -> okay
        Position 4: E -> okay (E not at 5)
        Position 5: L

        Also, no R or N. So ""CAMEL"" is a candidate.

   Another: ""CAPER""? -> has R -> invalid.

   Another: ""CADET"": C, A, D, E, T -> 
        Position 2: A -> okay?
        Position 3: D -> okay
        Position 4: E -> okay (not 5)
        Position 5: T
        No R or N.

        So ""CADET"" is a candidate.

   Another: ""CATER"": has R -> invalid.

   Another: ""CABLE""? E at 5 -> invalid.

   Another: ""CLEAN""? has N -> invalid because feedback said N is absent? 
        First guess: N at position 4 -> feedback was N(x) meaning N is not in the word. So we cannot use N.

   So possible: ""CLEAT"", ""CAMEL"", ""CADET""

   Now, which one to choose? 

   We want to test letters that we haven't tried yet. In ""crane"", we tried: C, R, A, N, E. 
   The known letters: we know C is fixed at 1, and A and E are in the word elsewhere.

   We have not tested: 
     For positions 2, 3, 4, 5: we need to use new letters to gain more information.

   For ""CAMEL"": letters: C, A, M, E, L -> M and L are new? Yes. 
   For ""CLEAT"": letters: C, L, E, A, T -> L and T are new? 
   For ""CADET"": letters: C, A, D, E, T -> D and T are new? 

   All candidate words have A and E. We are trying to determine the positions of A and E and also find the remaining letters.

   Perhaps we should choose a word that has A and E in positions we haven't tried? 

   In the first guess, A was at position 3 (which we know is wrong) and E at position 5 (wrong). 
   So we should avoid positions 3 for A? But we can't know. The word might have A at position 2, 4, or alternatively position 5? 
   Similarly, E can be at 2, 3, 4? 

   Since we don't know the positions, and we have multiple candidates, I think ""CAMEL"" might be a good choice because it tests A at position 2 (new position) and E at position 4 (new position, originally E was at 5). 
   Also, it tests M and L which are new.

   However, note that the word ""CAMEL"" has E at position 4. But in the first word, we had A at 3 and E at 5. Now we are putting A at 2 and E at 4.

   Alternatively, ""CLEAT"" has A at 4 and E at 3? That might also be good.

   How about maximizing new letters? 

   We have tried: C, R, A, N, E -> so we know A and E are present. So we only need to avoid R and N? 
   Therefore, any word that uses new letters except R and N is fine? 

   I think ""CLEAT"" and ""CAMEL"" are equally good. But note: in ""CLEAT"", E is at position 3? Originally, we had A at position 3 and it was wrong. But that doesn't say anything about E? 

   Actually, position 3 is still free for E? Because feedback only said A is not at 3. So E can be at 3.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put A and E in the same position as the first guess? 

   Let me check the positions we are using for A and E in candidates:

   CAMEL: A at 2, E at 4 -> avoids previous position for A (3) and for E (5).
   CLEAT: A at 4, E at 3 -> avoids E at 5? Yes, but puts E at 3 -> which hasn't been tested.
   CADET: A at 2, E at 4 -> same as CAMEL? 

   CADET: A at position 2? We haven't tested position 2 for A? Similarly, CAMEL: A at 2. 
   But note: the feedback for the first word didn't say anything about position 2? So we don't know.

   Actually, we don't have any information on position 2? We know the first letter is C, and position 2 could be anything? 

   How about using a word that avoids positions we already know are invalid? 

   We know only:
      position 3: cannot be A? Because feedback said A is in the word but not at position 3? So we must avoid A at 3? 
      position 5: cannot be E? 

   For other positions, we have no constraints? 

   Therefore, in CAMEL and CADET, A is at 2? That's allowed? 

   Let me decide: I'll choose ""CAMEL"". Why? Because we are using new letters M and L? And position for A is 2? Which hasn't been tested. And E at position 4? Which hasn't been tested.

   Or ""CLEAT"" tests L and T for the first time? And positions: A at 4 (new) and E at 3 (which is a position we haven't tried for E? We only tried E at 5). 

   But note: in the first word, position 3 was A? And it was wrong. But E can be at 3? That's fine.

   So both words seem okay.

   I think ""CLEAT"" might be a better choice? Because it uses three new letters (L, E, A, T) ... actually E and A are known? 
   But we have to include A and E? So we are testing two new letters: L and T? 

   Similarly, CAMEL tests M and L? 

   How about CADET? Tests D and T? 

   We have many possibilities. Since we are early in the game, it doesn't matter much? 

   Let's choose ""CLEAT"" because it uses common letters? 

   I'll go with ""CLEAT"".

   But wait: in the word ""CLEAT"", we are putting E at position 3? And in the first word, we had E at position 5? 
   We also have A at position 4? Which is different from its original position 3? So that's fine.

   Also, no R or N? 

   So: C L E A T

   We'll see what the feedback says.

   Alternatively, we might want to avoid repeating the same mistake? And maximize information? Another common word: ""SLATE"" is not starting with C? 

   We must start with C? 

   After reconsidering: we have the constraint that the first letter is C, so we are forced?

   So my next guess: ""CLEAT""

<guess>cleat</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- **R** is absent (x), so excluded.
- **A** is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- **N** is absent (x), so excluded.
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Key deductions:
- The secret word starts with **C**.
- **R** and **N** are not in the word.
- **A** must appear in positions 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- **E** must appear in positions 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

For the second guess:
- Must avoid **R** and **N**.
- Must include **A** and **E**.
- Test new letters to gain more positional information.
- Optimal candidates: ""CLEAT"", ""CAMEL"", or ""CADET"".

Choosing **CLEAT** because:
- Places **A** in position 4 (new untested position).
- Places **E** in position 3 (new position for E, previously tested only at position 5).
- Introduces new letters **L** and **T** to gather additional feedback.

<guess>cleat</guess>",cleat,"We are given feedback on our first guess ""CRANE"":
 C(✓) -> C is in the correct position.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word at all.
 A(-) -> A is in the word but in the wrong position.
 N(x) -> N is not in the word.
 E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So, what we know:
 1. The first letter is C.
 2. The word does not contain R or N.
 3. The word contains A and E, but not in the positions they were in the first guess.
    In ""CRANE"", A was in position 3 and E in position 5. Since they are present but wrong position, 
    A cannot be in position 3 and E cannot be in position 5.

 Also, since R and N are absent, we must avoid them in the next guess.

 We also know the secret word is 5 letters and must include:
   - C at the start (position 1)
   - A somewhere but not at position 3
   - E somewhere but not at position 5

 Now, let's think about possibilities:

 We know: 
   Position 1: C [fixed]
   Position 2: ? (cannot be R, and we know R is not in the word) 
   Position 3: ? (cannot be A, because A is not in position 3) and cannot be R or N
   Position 4: ? (cannot be R or N)
   Position 5: ? (cannot be E, and cannot be R or N)

 Since A and E must appear and we already have C at position 1, we need to form a word that fits.

 Let me try to think of words starting with C that contain A and E, but no R, N.

 However, we also know that A cannot be at position 3.

 Similarly, E can be at positions: 2, 3, or 4? Not 5? Actually, E is not at position 5, so can be at 1? But position 1 is C. So E can be at 2, 3, or 4.

        Position 4: E -> okay (E not at 5)
        Position 5: L

        Also, no R or N. So ""CAMEL"" is a candidate.

   Another: ""CAPER""? -> has R -> invalid.

   Another: ""CADET"": C, A, D, E, T -> 
        Position 2: A -> okay?
        Position 3: D -> okay
        Position 4: E -> okay (not 5)
        Position 5: T
        No R or N.

        So ""CADET"" is a candidate.

   Another: ""CATER"": has R -> invalid.

   Another: ""CABLE""? E at 5 -> invalid.

   Another: ""CLEAN""? has N -> invalid because feedback said N is absent? 
        First guess: N at position 4 -> feedback was N(x) meaning N is not in the word. So we cannot use N.

   So possible: ""CLEAT"", ""CAMEL"", ""CADET""

   Now, which one to choose? 

   We want to test letters that we haven't tried yet. In ""crane"", we tried: C, R, A, N, E. 
   The known letters: we know C is fixed at 1, and A and E are in the word elsewhere.

   We have not tested: 
     For positions 2, 3, 4, 5: we need to use new letters to gain more information.

   For ""CAMEL"": letters: C, A, M, E, L -> M and L are new? Yes. 
   For ""CLEAT"": letters: C, L, E, A, T -> L and T are new? 
   For ""CADET"": letters: C, A, D, E, T -> D and T are new? 

   All candidate words have A and E. We are trying to determine the positions of A and E and also find the remaining letters.

   Perhaps we should choose a word that has A and E in positions we haven't tried? 

   In the first guess, A was at position 3 (which we know is wrong) and E at position 5 (wrong). 
   So we should avoid positions 3 for A? But we can't know. The word might have A at position 2, 4, or alternatively position 5? 
   Similarly, E can be at 2, 3, 4? 

   Since we don't know the positions, and we have multiple candidates, I think ""CAMEL"" might be a good choice because it tests A at position 2 (new position) and E at position 4 (new position, originally E was at 5). 
   Also, it tests M and L which are new.

   However, note that the word ""CAMEL"" has E at position 4. But in the first word, we had A at 3 and E at 5. Now we are putting A at 2 and E at 4.

   Alternatively, ""CLEAT"" has A at 4 and E at 3? That might also be good.

   How about maximizing new letters? 

   We have tried: C, R, A, N, E -> so we know A and E are present. So we only need to avoid R and N? 
   Therefore, any word that uses new letters except R and N is fine? 

   I think ""CLEAT"" and ""CAMEL"" are equally good. But note: in ""CLEAT"", E is at position 3? Originally, we had A at position 3 and it was wrong. But that doesn't say anything about E? 

   Actually, position 3 is still free for E? Because feedback only said A is not at 3. So E can be at 3.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put A and E in the same position as the first guess? 

   Let me check the positions we are using for A and E in candidates:

   CAMEL: A at 2, E at 4 -> avoids previous position for A (3) and for E (5).
   CLEAT: A at 4, E at 3 -> avoids E at 5? Yes, but puts E at 3 -> which hasn't been tested.
   CADET: A at 2, E at 4 -> same as CAMEL? 

   CADET: A at position 2? We haven't tested position 2 for A? Similarly, CAMEL: A at 2. 
   But note: the feedback for the first word didn't say anything about position 2? So we don't know.

   Actually, we don't have any information on position 2? We know the first letter is C, and position 2 could be anything? 

   How about using a word that avoids positions we already know are invalid? 

   We know only:
      position 3: cannot be A? Because feedback said A is in the word but not at position 3? So we must avoid A at 3? 
      position 5: cannot be E? 

   For other positions, we have no constraints? 

   Therefore, in CAMEL and CADET, A is at 2? That's allowed? 

   Let me decide: I'll choose ""CAMEL"". Why? Because we are using new letters M and L? And position for A is 2? Which hasn't been tested. And E at position 4? Which hasn't been tested.

   Or ""CLEAT"" tests L and T for the first time? And positions: A at 4 (new) and E at 3 (which is a position we haven't tried for E? We only tried E at 5). 

   But note: in the first word, position 3 was A? And it was wrong. But E can be at 3? That's fine.

   So both words seem okay.

   I think ""CLEAT"" might be a better choice? Because it uses three new letters (L, E, A, T) ... actually E and A are known? 
   But we have to include A and E? So we are testing two new letters: L and T? 

   Similarly, CAMEL tests M and L? 

   How about CADET? Tests D and T? 

   We have many possibilities. Since we are early in the game, it doesn't matter much? 

   Let's choose ""CLEAT"" because it uses common letters? 

   I'll go with ""CLEAT"".

   But wait: in the word ""CLEAT"", we are putting E at position 3? And in the first word, we had E at position 5? 
   We also have A at position 4? Which is different from its original position 3? So that's fine.

   Also, no R or N? 

   So: C L E A T

   We'll see what the feedback says.

   Alternatively, we might want to avoid repeating the same mistake? And maximize information? Another common word: ""SLATE"" is not starting with C? 

   We must start with C? 

   After reconsidering: we have the constraint that the first letter is C, so we are forced?

   So my next guess: ""CLEAT""

<guess>cleat</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- **R** is absent (x), so excluded.
- **A** is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- **N** is absent (x), so excluded.
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Key deductions:
- The secret word starts with **C**.
- **R** and **N** are not in the word.
- **A** must appear in positions 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- **E** must appear in positions 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

For the second guess:
- Must avoid **R** and **N**.
- Must include **A** and **E**.
- Test new letters to gain more positional information.
- Optimal candidates: ""CLEAT"", ""CAMEL"", or ""CADET"".

Choosing **CLEAT** because:
- Places **A** in position 4 (new untested position).
- Places **E** in position 3 (new position for E, previously tested only at position 5).
- Introduces new letters **L** and **T** to gather additional feedback.",Guess 2: cleat -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(x) E(-) A(-) T(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,cadet,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.
 Also, including at least two vowels is helpful.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. 
 - C and R are common consonants.
 - A and E are common vowels.
 - N is also a common consonant.

 This word covers 5 distinct letters and is a good starting point.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on our first guess ""CRANE"":
 C(✓) -> C is in the correct position.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word at all.
 A(-) -> A is in the word but in the wrong position.
 N(x) -> N is not in the word.
 E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So, what we know:
 1. The first letter is C.
 2. The word does not contain R or N.
 3. The word contains A and E, but not in the positions they were in the first guess.
    In ""CRANE"", A was in position 3 and E in position 5. Since they are present but wrong position, 
    A cannot be in position 3 and E cannot be in position 5.

 Also, since R and N are absent, we must avoid them in the next guess.

 We also know the secret word is 5 letters and must include:
   - C at the start (position 1)
   - A somewhere but not at position 3
   - E somewhere but not at position 5

 Now, let's think about possibilities:

 We know: 
   Position 1: C [fixed]
   Position 2: ? (cannot be R, and we know R is not in the word) 
   Position 3: ? (cannot be A, because A is not in position 3) and cannot be R or N
   Position 4: ? (cannot be R or N)
   Position 5: ? (cannot be E, and cannot be R or N)

 Since A and E must appear and we already have C at position 1, we need to form a word that fits.

 Let me try to think of words starting with C that contain A and E, but no R, N.

 Also note: we have eliminated R and N, so they are not in the word.

 Possible letters: We should consider common letters that haven't been tried: L, T, S, D, O, U, M, P, etc.

 We can try to put A and E in different positions.

 Where can A be? Not position 3. So positions: 2, 4, or 5? 
 But remember: position 5 cannot be E, but it can be A? Yes, because the feedback only said E is in the word but not at 5, it didn't say anything about A at 5. 
 However, we also know that A cannot be at position 3.

 Similarly, E can be at positions: 2, 3, or 4? Not 5? Actually, E is not at position 5, so can be at 1? But position 1 is C. So E can be at 2, 3, or 4.

 But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but let's assume none until we see feedback about duplicates.

 We'll try to form a word that fits:

 Consider: 
   Position 1: C
   Position 2: ? (we want to try a letter that might be common and that we can test along with A and E)

 Let me try putting A at position 2? Is that possible? Actually, we don't know but let's avoid it for now because we might want to use the feedback to test multiple positions.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has A and E in different positions to narrow down.

 Let me list some words starting with C that have A and E and exclude R and N.

 Some possibilities:
   CABLE: C, A, B, L, E -> 
      Positions: C at 1 (good), A at 2 (is that okay? we don't know yet about A), B, L, E at 5 -> but E at position 5 is not allowed per feedback? 
      Feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot have E at 5. Therefore, CABLE is invalid because E is at 5.

   CACHE: has duplicate C? It has C at 1 already. Then A at 2? But then we have C at 1 and another C at 3? The word has two Cs. 
      However, we don't know if the secret word has duplicate C? Our feedback so far: only one C was at the start and it was correct. 
      The feedback for C was (✓) meaning that one C at position 1 is correct. But what if there is another C? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters explicitly? 
      Actually, the feedback format: for each letter, we get a symbol. If we guess duplicate letters, then it will mark each occurrence appropriately.

      But in our last guess ""CRANE"", we had only one C. The feedback said C was correct. So if the word had two Cs, then the second C is not accounted for? 
      We don't know. So it's risky to guess duplicates? But that's part of the strategy.

   How about ""CAUSE""? 
      Position: C, A, U, S, E -> E is at position 5? But feedback says E cannot be at 5 -> invalid.

   How about ""CASTE""? 
      C, A, S, T, E -> E at position 5 -> invalid.

   We need E not in position 5.

   How about ""CLEAR""? 
      C, L, E, A, R -> but R is in the word? We have eliminated R (feedback said R is absent). Therefore, ""CLEAR"" has R -> invalid.

   We must avoid R and N.

   How about ""CHASE""? 
      C, H, A, S, E -> E at 5 -> invalid.

   How about ""CLEAT""? 
      C, L, E, A, T -> 
        Positions: 
          1: C (fixed)
          2: L 
          3: E -> We know E can be at position 3? Because feedback from first guess only forbade E at 5. So yes.
          4: A -> We know A cannot be at position 3? But at position 4 is allowed. 
          5: T

        This word has A at position 4 -> okay because originally it was at 3? Now it's at 4, which is different. 
        And E at position 3 -> okay because we don't have any feedback that E is not at 3? Only that it's not at 5.

        Also, no R and no N? Yes. 

        So ""CLEAT"" is a candidate.

   But note: we also have A? We are putting A at position 4. We need to check if that conflicts? We only know A is not in position 3. Position 4 is fine.

   Another candidate: ""CAMEL"": C, M, E at 3? But then A at position 2? 
        Position 1: C
        Position 2: A -> but we don't know if A can be at 2? It could be.
        Position 3: M -> okay
        Position 4: E -> okay (E not at 5)
        Position 5: L

        Also, no R or N. So ""CAMEL"" is a candidate.

   Another: ""CAPER""? -> has R -> invalid.

   Another: ""CADET"": C, A, D, E, T -> 
        Position 2: A -> okay?
        Position 3: D -> okay
        Position 4: E -> okay (not 5)
        Position 5: T
        No R or N.

        So ""CADET"" is a candidate.

   Another: ""CATER"": has R -> invalid.

   Another: ""CABLE""? E at 5 -> invalid.

   Another: ""CLEAN""? has N -> invalid because feedback said N is absent? 
        First guess: N at position 4 -> feedback was N(x) meaning N is not in the word. So we cannot use N.

   So possible: ""CLEAT"", ""CAMEL"", ""CADET""

   Now, which one to choose? 

   We want to test letters that we haven't tried yet. In ""crane"", we tried: C, R, A, N, E. 
   The known letters: we know C is fixed at 1, and A and E are in the word elsewhere.

   We have not tested: 
     For positions 2, 3, 4, 5: we need to use new letters to gain more information.

   For ""CAMEL"": letters: C, A, M, E, L -> M and L are new? Yes. 
   For ""CLEAT"": letters: C, L, E, A, T -> L and T are new? 
   For ""CADET"": letters: C, A, D, E, T -> D and T are new? 

   All candidate words have A and E. We are trying to determine the positions of A and E and also find the remaining letters.

   Perhaps we should choose a word that has A and E in positions we haven't tried? 

   In the first guess, A was at position 3 (which we know is wrong) and E at position 5 (wrong). 
   So we should avoid positions 3 for A? But we can't know. The word might have A at position 2, 4, or alternatively position 5? 
   Similarly, E can be at 2, 3, 4? 

   Since we don't know the positions, and we have multiple candidates, I think ""CAMEL"" might be a good choice because it tests A at position 2 (new position) and E at position 4 (new position, originally E was at 5). 
   Also, it tests M and L which are new.

   However, note that the word ""CAMEL"" has E at position 4. But in the first word, we had A at 3 and E at 5. Now we are putting A at 2 and E at 4.

   Alternatively, ""CLEAT"" has A at 4 and E at 3? That might also be good.

   How about maximizing new letters? 

   We have tried: C, R, A, N, E -> so we know A and E are present. So we only need to avoid R and N? 
   Therefore, any word that uses new letters except R and N is fine? 

   I think ""CLEAT"" and ""CAMEL"" are equally good. But note: in ""CLEAT"", E is at position 3? Originally, we had A at position 3 and it was wrong. But that doesn't say anything about E? 

   Actually, position 3 is still free for E? Because feedback only said A is not at 3. So E can be at 3.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put A and E in the same position as the first guess? 

   Let me check the positions we are using for A and E in candidates:

   CAMEL: A at 2, E at 4 -> avoids previous position for A (3) and for E (5).
   CLEAT: A at 4, E at 3 -> avoids E at 5? Yes, but puts E at 3 -> which hasn't been tested.
   CADET: A at 2, E at 4 -> same as CAMEL? 

   CADET: A at position 2? We haven't tested position 2 for A? Similarly, CAMEL: A at 2. 
   But note: the feedback for the first word didn't say anything about position 2? So we don't know.

   Actually, we don't have any information on position 2? We know the first letter is C, and position 2 could be anything? 

   How about using a word that avoids positions we already know are invalid? 

   We know only:
      position 3: cannot be A? Because feedback said A is in the word but not at position 3? So we must avoid A at 3? 
      position 5: cannot be E? 

   For other positions, we have no constraints? 

   Therefore, in CAMEL and CADET, A is at 2? That's allowed? 

   Let me decide: I'll choose ""CAMEL"". Why? Because we are using new letters M and L? And position for A is 2? Which hasn't been tested. And E at position 4? Which hasn't been tested.

   Or ""CLEAT"" tests L and T for the first time? And positions: A at 4 (new) and E at 3 (which is a position we haven't tried for E? We only tried E at 5). 

   But note: in the first word, position 3 was A? And it was wrong. But E can be at 3? That's fine.

   So both words seem okay.

   I think ""CLEAT"" might be a better choice? Because it uses three new letters (L, E, A, T) ... actually E and A are known? 
   But we have to include A and E? So we are testing two new letters: L and T? 

   Similarly, CAMEL tests M and L? 

   How about CADET? Tests D and T? 

   We have many possibilities. Since we are early in the game, it doesn't matter much? 

   Let's choose ""CLEAT"" because it uses common letters? 

   I'll go with ""CLEAT"".

   But wait: in the word ""CLEAT"", we are putting E at position 3? And in the first word, we had E at position 5? 
   We also have A at position 4? Which is different from its original position 3? So that's fine.

   Also, no R or N? 

   So: C L E A T

   We'll see what the feedback says.

   Alternatively, we might want to avoid repeating the same mistake? And maximize information? Another common word: ""SLATE"" is not starting with C? 

   We must start with C? 

   After reconsidering: we have the constraint that the first letter is C, so we are forced?

   So my next guess: ""CLEAT""

<guess>cleat</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":

Not 5? Actually, E is not at position 5, so can be at 1? But position 1 is C. So E can be at 2, 3, or 4.\n\n But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know, but let\'s assume none until we see feedback about duplicates.\n\n We\'ll try to form a word that fits:\n\n Consider: \n   Position 1: C\n   Position 2: ? (we want to try a letter that might be common and that we can test along with A and E)\n\n Let me try putting A at position 2? Is that possible? Actually, we don\'t know but let\'s avoid it for now because we might want to use the feedback to test multiple positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has A and E in different positions to narrow down.\n\n Let me list some words starting with C that have A and E and exclude R and N.\n\n Some possibilities:\n   CABLE: C, A, B, L, E -> \n      Positions: C at 1 (good), A at 2 (is that okay? we don\'t know yet about A), B, L, E at 5 -> but E at position 5 is not allowed per feedback? \n      Feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot have E at 5. Therefore, CABLE is invalid because E is at 5.\n\n   CACHE: has duplicate C? It has C at 1 already. Then A at 2? But then we have C at 1 and another C at 3? The word has two Cs. \n      However, we don\'t know if the secret word has duplicate C? Our feedback so far: only one C was at the start and it was correct. \n      The feedback for C was (✓) meaning that one C at position 1 is correct. But what if there is another C? The feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicate letters explicitly? \n      Actually, the feedback format: for each letter, we get a symbol. If we guess duplicate letters, then it will mark each occurrence appropriately.\n\n      But in our last guess ""CRANE"", we had only one C. The feedback said C was correct. So if the word had two Cs, then the second C is not accounted for? \n      We don\'t know. So it\'s risky to guess duplicates? But that\'s part of the strategy.\n\n   How about ""CAUSE""? \n      Position: C, A, U, S, E -> E is at position 5? But feedback says E cannot be at 5 -> invalid.\n\n   How about ""CASTE""? \n      C, A, S, T, E -> E at position 5 -> invalid.\n\n   We need E not in position 5.\n\n   How about ""CLEAR""? \n      C, L, E, A, R -> but R is in the word? We have eliminated R (feedback said R is absent). Therefore, ""CLEAR"" has R -> invalid.\n\n   We must avoid R and N.\n\n   How about ""CHASE""? \n      C, H, A, S, E -> E at 5 -> invalid.\n\n   How about ""CLEAT""? \n      C, L, E, A, T -> \n        Positions: \n          1: C (fixed)\n          2: L \n          3: E -> We know E can be at position 3? Because feedback from first guess only forbade E at 5. So yes.\n          4: A -> We know A cannot be at position 3? But at position 4 is allowed. \n          5: T\n\n        This word has A at position 4 -> okay because originally it was at 3? Now it\'s at 4, which is different. \n        And E at position 3 -> okay because we don\'t have any feedback that E is not at 3? Only that it\'s not at 5.\n\n        Also, no R and no N? Yes. \n\n        So ""CLEAT"" is a candidate.\n\n   But note: we also have A? We are putting A at position 4. We need to check if that conflicts? We only know A is not in position 3. Position 4 is fine.\n\n   Another candidate: ""CAMEL"": C, M, E at 3? But then A at position 2? \n        Position 1: C\n        Position 2: A -> but we don\'t know if A can be at 2? It could be.\n        Position 3: M -> okay\n        Position 4: E -> okay (E not at 5)\n        Position 5: L\n\n        Also, no R or N. So ""CAMEL"" is a candidate.\n\n   Another: ""CAPER""? -> has R -> invalid.\n\n   Another: ""CADET"": C, A, D, E, T -> \n        Position 2: A -> okay?\n        Position 3: D -> okay\n        Position 4: E -> okay (not 5)\n        Position 5: T\n        No R or N.\n\n        So ""CADET"" is a candidate.\n\n   Another: ""CATER"": has R -> invalid.\n\n   Another: ""CABLE""? E at 5 -> invalid.\n\n   Another: ""CLEAN""? has N -> invalid because feedback said N is absent? \n        First guess: N at position 4 -> feedback was N(x) meaning N is not in the word. So we cannot use N.\n\n   So possible: ""CLEAT"", ""CAMEL"", ""CADET""\n\n   Now, which one to choose? \n\n   We want to test letters that we haven\'t tried yet. In ""crane"", we tried: C, R, A, N, E. \n   The known letters: we know C is fixed at 1, and A and E are in the word elsewhere.\n\n   We have not tested: \n     For positions 2, 3, 4, 5: we need to use new letters to gain more information.\n\n   For ""CAMEL"": letters: C, A, M, E, L -> M and L are new? Yes. \n   For ""CLEAT"": letters: C, L, E, A, T -> L and T are new? \n   For ""CADET"": letters: C, A, D, E, T -> D and T are new? \n\n   All candidate words have A and E. We are trying to determine the positions of A and E and also find the remaining letters.\n\n   Perhaps we should choose a word that has A and E in positions we haven\'t tried? \n\n   In the first guess, A was at position 3 (which we know is wrong) and E at position 5 (wrong). \n   So we should avoid positions 3 for A? But we can\'t know. The word might have A at position 2, 4, or alternatively position 5? \n   Similarly, E can be at 2, 3, 4? \n\n   Since we don\'t know the positions, and we have multiple candidates, I think ""CAMEL"" might be a good choice because it tests A at position 2 (new position) and E at position 4 (new position, originally E was at 5). \n   Also, it tests M and L which are new.\n\n   However, note that the word ""CAMEL"" has E at position 4. But in the first word, we had A at 3 and E at 5. Now we are putting A at 2 and E at 4.\n\n   Alternatively, ""CLEAT"" has A at 4 and E at 3? That might also be good.\n\n   How about maximizing new letters? \n\n   We have tried: C, R, A, N, E -> so we know A and E are present. So we only need to avoid R and N? \n   Therefore, any word that uses new letters except R and N is fine? \n\n   I think ""CLEAT"" and ""CAMEL"" are equally good. But note: in ""CLEAT"", E is at position 3? Originally, we had A at position 3 and it was wrong. But that doesn\'t say anything about E? \n\n   Actually, position 3 is still free for E? Because feedback only said A is not at 3. So E can be at 3.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t put A and E in the same position as the first guess? \n\n   Let me check the positions we are using for A and E in candidates:\n\n   CAMEL: A at 2, E at 4 -> avoids previous position for A (3) and for E (5).\n   CLEAT: A at 4, E at 3 -> avoids E at 5? Yes, but puts E at 3 -> which hasn\'t been tested.\n   CADET: A at 2, E at 4 -> same as CAMEL? \n\n   CADET: A at position 2? We haven\'t tested position 2 for A? Similarly, CAMEL: A at 2. \n   But note: the feedback for the first word didn\'t say anything about position 2? So we don\'t know.\n\n   Actually, we don\'t have any information on position 2? We know the first letter is C, and position 2 could be anything? \n\n   How about using a word that avoids positions we already know are invalid? \n\n   We know only:\n      position 3: cannot be A? Because feedback said A is in the word but not at position 3? So we must avoid A at 3? \n      position 5: cannot be E? \n\n   For other positions, we have no constraints? \n\n   Therefore, in CAMEL and CADET, A is at 2? That\'s allowed? \n\n   Let me decide: I\'ll choose ""CAMEL"". Why? Because we are using new letters M and L? And position for A is 2? Which hasn\'t been tested. And E at position 4? Which hasn\'t been tested.\n\n   Or ""CLEAT"" tests L and T for the first time? And positions: A at 4 (new) and E at 3 (which is a position we haven\'t tried for E? We only tried E at 5). \n\n   But note: in the first word, position 3 was A? And it was wrong. But E can be at 3? That\'s fine.\n\n   So both words seem okay.\n\n   I think ""CLEAT"" might be a better choice? Because it uses three new letters (L, E, A, T) ... actually E and A are known? \n   But we have to include A and E? So we are testing two new letters: L and T? \n\n   Similarly, CAMEL tests M and L? \n\n   How about CADET? Tests D and T? \n\n   We have many possibilities. Since we are early in the game, it doesn\'t matter much? \n\n   Let\'s choose ""CLEAT"" because it uses common letters? \n\n   I\'ll go with ""CLEAT"".\n\n   But wait: in the word ""CLEAT"", we are putting E at position 3? And in the first word, we had E at position 5? \n   We also have A at position 4? Which is different from its original position 3? So that\'s fine.\n\n   Also, no R or N? \n\n   So: C L E A T\n\n   We\'ll see what the feedback says.\n\n   Alternatively, we might want to avoid repeating the same mistake? And maximize information? Another common word: ""SLATE"" is not starting with C? \n\n   We must start with C? \n\n   After reconsidering: we have the constraint that the first letter is C, so we are forced?\n\n   So my next guess: ""CLEAT""\n\n<guess>cleat</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).\n- **R** is absent (x), so excluded.\n- **A** is in the word but not in position 3 (-).\n- **N** is absent (x), so excluded.\n- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (-).\n\nKey deductions:\n- The secret word starts with **C**.\n- **R** and **N** are not in the word.\n- **A** must appear in positions 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).\n- **E** must appear in positions 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must avoid **R** and **N**.\n- Must include **A** and **E**.\n- Test new letters to gain more positional information.\n- Optimal candidates: ""CLEAT"", ""CAMEL"", or ""CADET"".\n\nChoosing **CLEAT** because:\n- Places **A** in position 4 (new untested position).\n- Places **E** in position 3 (new position for E, previously tested only at position 5).\n- Introduces new letters **L** and **T** to gather additional feedback.\n\n<guess>cleat</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: cleat -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(x) E(-) A(-) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess ""crane"":
  C(✓) at position 1 -> correct, so secret word starts with C.
  R(x) -> R is not in the word.
  A(-) -> A is in the word but not in position 3.
  N(x) -> N is not in the word.
  E(-) -> E is in the word but not in position 5.

Second guess ""cleat"":
  C(✓) -> position 1 is C, verified.
  L(x) -> L is not in the word.
  E(-) -> E is in the word but not in position 3 (because we placed E at position 3 in this guess and got -).
  A(-) -> A is in the word but not in position 4 (since we placed A at position 4 and got -).
  T(✓) -> T is correct and in position 5.

So, summarizing what we know:
1. The word starts with C (position 1) and ends with T (position 5). So: C _ _ _ T
2. Letters in the word: A, E, C, T (C and T are placed).
   - We also know from the first guess that E is present and not at position 5 (now we know position 5 is T, so that's consistent).
   - From the second guess, we know E and A are present but not at the positions we tried: 
        E is not at position 3 (from second guess) and not at position 5 (from first guess). 
        A is not at position 3 (first guess) and not at position 4 (second guess).
3. Position 1: C (fixed)
   Position 5: T (fixed)
4. Absent letters: R, N, L (so we avoid these).
5. We must place A and E in positions 2, 3, or 4? But note:
   - Positions available: 2, 3, 4.
   - Constraints for A: cannot be at position 3 or 4. Therefore, A must be at position 2? 
        Because positions 2, 3, 4 are the only ones left. But we have ruled out position 3 and 4 for A? 
        So A must be at position 2.

   Similarly for E:
   - E cannot be at position 3 (from second guess) and cannot be at position 5 (from first guess). 
        Position 5 is T, so that's fine. 
        Now, positions available for E: 2,3,4? But we have:
          Position 3: cannot be E (from second guess feedback: E guessed at position 3 -> wrong position).
          Position 4: we don't know yet? 
          Position 2: we don't know.

        Therefore, E cannot be at position 3? Then E must be at position 2 or 4.

   But note: we just deduced that A must be at position 2? So position 2 cannot be E? 
        Because one letter per position? 

   So let's break it down:

   For A:
      We know A cannot be at 3 (from first guess) and cannot be at 4 (from second guess). 
      Therefore, the only possibility left for A is position 2? 
        That is: position 2 must be A.

   Then for E:
      Since position 2 is now A? Then E must be at position 4? because positions 3 and 5 are eliminated? 
        Position 5 is T? So not available? 
        Position 3: E cannot be at position 3 (from second guess: feedback at position 3 was E and it was wrong position). 
        Therefore, E must be at position 4? 

   So if A is at position 2 and E is at position 4? Then the word would be: C A _ E T

   But note: position 3 is still unknown? 

   However, we must consider: are there duplicate letters? We haven't had any feedback indicating duplicates? 

   Also, we know that the word has exactly these letters: C, A, E, T and one more letter? because positions 1,2,4,5 are fixed? then position 3 is missing.

   We know the word must include A, E, and the letters we have? Also, we know the absent letters: R, N, L? so the word cannot have them? 

   Therefore, the word is C A ? E T, and the missing letter ? must be a letter that hasn't been excluded? 

   Now, what about the feedback from the first guess: 
        In ""crane"", A was at position 3 (which we now know is wrong position) and E was at position 5 (wrong position). 

   In our guessed word ""cleat"", we are going to set the word as CA_E T? but wait, we haven't guessed that yet? 

   We deduced that the word must start with C, end with T, A in position 2, E in position 4? and an unknown in position 3? 

   Now, what about E? In the first guess, E was at position 5 and was incorrect? That we already know? 

   Now, what letters can go in position 3? 
      It must be a letter that is not in the excluded list? Excluded: R, N, L? And also it must be present? And it hasn't been guessed? 

   We haven't guessed any letters for position 3? So we need to choose a word that matches the pattern: C A ? E T

   But we must ensure the entire word is valid? 

   Alternatively, we can assume we have the pattern? 

   But wait: we must also check if the second guess feedback already covered this? 

   However, the second guess ""cleat"" was C L E A T? 
        We got: C(✓) L(x) E(-) A(-) T(✓) 

        Now, if the word were C A X E T, then in ""cleat"":
          Position 1: C -> matches? 
          Position 2: L -> but we now think it should be A? So L would be wrong? and we got L(x) -> meaning L is absent? 
          That matches because L is not in the word? 
          Position 3: E -> but in the word, position 3 is X? which if X is not E? then E would be at position 4? so E was guessed at position 3? so feedback says it's not there? -> (?) the E in the word is at position 4, so E at position 3 is absent? So (-) is not applicable? Actually, feedback was E(-) meaning E is present but not at the position? So that matches? Because E is present? but not at position 3? 
          Position 4: A -> but in the word, position 4 is E? so we guessed A at position 4? but the word has E? which is present? but not A at position 4? so A(-) is also correct? because A is present? but in the word A is at position 2? so A is in the word? but not at position 4? 
          Position 5: T -> matches? 

        So feedback fits.

   Therefore, the word is C A ? E T? and the unknown letter at position 3? 

   Now, what letters haven't been excluded? Excluded: R, N, L? Also, we know the letters in the word: C, A, E, T? and one more? 

   We also tried in ""cleat"": L? which is excluded? 

   What other letters have been tested? 
      In ""crane"": we tested C, R, A, N, E -> so we know about A and E? 
      We haven't tested any other letters? So the remaining letters must be almost anything else? 

   But the word must be a valid English word? 

   Let me list words matching C A ? E T pattern? 

   Common words: 
     CABET? -> not a word.
     CADET? -> yes! C A D E T
     CAPET? -> not common? 
     CARET? -> but R is excluded? excluded R? 
     CARTE? -> R excluded? 
     CASTE? -> S? 
     CATER? -> R excluded? 
     CAVET? -> not a word? 

   So CADET is a possibility? 
        Letters: C, A, D, E, T? 
        We have D? which hasn't been tested.

   How about CAFET? -> not a word? 

   So CADET is a valid word? 

   But note: in our pattern, position 4 is E? So CADET is C A D E T? 
        Position 3: D? 

   But does it satisfy the constraints? 
        Position 1: C? -> correct? 
        Position 2: A? -> if the word is CADET? then A at position 2? matches our plan? 
        Position 3: D? new? 
        Position 4: E? 
        Position 5: T? correct? 

   Also, the feedback from first guess: 
        ""crane"": 
          Position 3: A? in CADET, position 3 is D? so A is not at 3? -> correct? and we know A is at 2? 
          Position 5: E? -> CADET has E at position 4? so E is present? but not at 5? -> correct? 
        And CADET has no R? No N? No L? -> so it passes.

   Second guess ""cleat"": 
        Feedback was: C(✓) L(x) (correct, L not in word) E(-) (E at position 3? but CADET has E at position 4? so E is present? but at position 4? so E guessed at 3 is wrong? -> correct) 
                   A(-) (A at position 4? but CADET has A at position 2? so A present? but not at 4? -> correct) T(✓) (correct).

   So CADET fits? 

   But wait: what if there are other words? Like CAVET? Not a valid word? 
   Or CANET? But N is excluded? 

   How about CAMET? 
        CAMET? Not commonly used? 

   Also, CAKET? Not a word? 

   So CADET seems a very strong candidate? 

   Alternatively, CASTE? 
        Let's check: CASTE -> C A S T E? 
        But then position 5? It would be E? But we know position 5 is T? from our feedback? 
        In second guess, we got T(✓) at position 5? So the word must end with T? Therefore, CASTE ends with E? So not CASTE? 

   Also CAPET? Not valid? 

   Therefore, CADET is a strong candidate? 

   But note: in CADET, position 3 is D? 

   However, we have not received any feedback that says D is in the word? So it could be? 

   And there is no competing word? 

   Therefore, our next guess should be CADET? But note: we only have 6 tries? and this might be the solution? 

   Alternatively, we could try to confirm? But since we have only one unknown letter? And we haven't tried D? 

   But why not? We can guess CADET? 

   Alternatively, if we are not sure? but we don't see another word? 

   We should consider: does CADET break any feedback? We don't see any? 

   Therefore, I will guess CADET? 

   But let me double-check the pattern: C A ? E T -> CADET: C A D E T -> matches.

   Also, the word CADET is valid? Yes.

   So next guess: CADET

   However, note that our deduction might be wrong? We are sure that A must be at position 2? 

   Why must A be at position 2? Because A cannot be at position 3 or 4? So only position 2? 

   But what about position 5? Position 5 is T? so A cannot be at position 5? 

   Positions available: 2,3,4? and we know A cannot be at 3 or 4? So only 2? 

   Similarly for E? 
        Positions: 2,3,4? 
        E cannot be at 3? 
        Also position 2: if A is at position 2? then E cannot be at 2? 
        Therefore E must be at position 4? 

   So pattern: C A ? E T? 

   We are missing the letter at position 3? 

   Therefore, CADET is a valid word? 

   I'll go with CADET? 

   But note: we have also learned that E is not at position 3? and A not at 4? 

   CADET: 
        C: matches
        A: matches at position 2? 
        D: an unknown? 
        E: at position 4? 
        T: matches? 

   So we are guessing? 

   Since CADET fits all the clues? 

   Let me write the guess: 

<guess>cadet</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
1. **C(✓)** in both guesses confirms the first letter is **C**.
2. **T(✓)** in the second guess confirms the fifth letter is **T**.
3. **A(-)** in both guesses means **A** is in the word but not in positions 3 (from ""crane"") or 4 (from ""cleat"").
4. **E(-)** means **E** is in the word but not in positions 5 (from ""crane"") or 3 (from ""cleat"").
5. **R(x)**, **N(x)**, and **L(x)** are absent and excluded.

### Deductions:
- **Pattern**: The word must be **C _ _ _ T**.
- **A** must be at position 2 (only remaining position: cannot be 1,3,4, or 5).
- **E** must be at position 4 (only remaining position after excluding 3,5, and position 2 now occupied by A).
- **Position 3** must be a letter not excluded (not R, N, L) and not used elsewhere.  
- Valid English words fitting **C A _ E T**:  
  - **CADET** is confirmed (only common word; e.g., ""CAMET"", ""CAPET"" invalid).

Thus, **CADET** fits all feedback:
- Position 1: **C** ✓  
- Position 2: **A** ✓  
- Position 3: **D** (new, untested)  
- Position 4: **E** ✓  
- Position 5: **T** ✓  

<guess>cadet</guess>",cadet,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess ""crane"":
  C(✓) at position 1 -> correct, so secret word starts with C.
  R(x) -> R is not in the word.
  A(-) -> A is in the word but not in position 3.
  N(x) -> N is not in the word.
  E(-) -> E is in the word but not in position 5.

Second guess ""cleat"":
  C(✓) -> position 1 is C, verified.
  L(x) -> L is not in the word.
  E(-) -> E is in the word but not in position 3 (because we placed E at position 3 in this guess and got -).
  A(-) -> A is in the word but not in position 4 (since we placed A at position 4 and got -).
  T(✓) -> T is correct and in position 5.

So, summarizing what we know:
1. The word starts with C (position 1) and ends with T (position 5). So: C _ _ _ T
2. Letters in the word: A, E, C, T (C and T are placed).
   - We also know from the first guess that E is present and not at position 5 (now we know position 5 is T, so that's consistent).
   - From the second guess, we know E and A are present but not at the positions we tried: 
        E is not at position 3 (from second guess) and not at position 5 (from first guess). 
        A is not at position 3 (first guess) and not at position 4 (second guess).
3. Position 1: C (fixed)
   Position 5: T (fixed)
4. Absent letters: R, N, L (so we avoid these).
5. We must place A and E in positions 2, 3, or 4? But note:
   - Positions available: 2, 3, 4.
   - Constraints for A: cannot be at position 3 or 4. Therefore, A must be at position 2? 
        Because positions 2, 3, 4 are the only ones left. But we have ruled out position 3 and 4 for A? 
        So A must be at position 2.

   Similarly for E:
   - E cannot be at position 3 (from second guess) and cannot be at position 5 (from first guess). 
        Position 5 is T, so that's fine. 
        Now, positions available for E: 2,3,4? But we have:
          Position 3: cannot be E (from second guess feedback: E guessed at position 3 -> wrong position).
          Position 4: we don't know yet? 
          Position 2: we don't know.

        Therefore, E cannot be at position 3? Then E must be at position 2 or 4.

   But note: we just deduced that A must be at position 2? So position 2 cannot be E? 
        Because one letter per position? 

   So let's break it down:

   For A:
      We know A cannot be at 3 (from first guess) and cannot be at 4 (from second guess). 
      Therefore, the only possibility left for A is position 2? 
        That is: position 2 must be A.

   Then for E:
      Since position 2 is now A? Then E must be at position 4? because positions 3 and 5 are eliminated? 
        Position 5 is T? So not available? 
        Position 3: E cannot be at position 3 (from second guess: feedback at position 3 was E and it was wrong position). 
        Therefore, E must be at position 4? 

   So if A is at position 2 and E is at position 4? Then the word would be: C A _ E T

   But note: position 3 is still unknown? 

   However, we must consider: are there duplicate letters? We haven't had any feedback indicating duplicates? 

   Also, we know that the word has exactly these letters: C, A, E, T and one more letter? because positions 1,2,4,5 are fixed? then position 3 is missing.

   We know the word must include A, E, and the letters we have? Also, we know the absent letters: R, N, L? so the word cannot have them? 

   Therefore, the word is C A ? E T, and the missing letter ? must be a letter that hasn't been excluded? 

   Now, what about the feedback from the first guess: 
        In ""crane"", A was at position 3 (which we now know is wrong position) and E was at position 5 (wrong position). 

   In our guessed word ""cleat"", we are going to set the word as CA_E T? but wait, we haven't guessed that yet? 

   We deduced that the word must start with C, end with T, A in position 2, E in position 4? and an unknown in position 3? 

   Now, what about E? In the first guess, E was at position 5 and was incorrect? That we already know? 

   Now, what letters can go in position 3? 
      It must be a letter that is not in the excluded list? Excluded: R, N, L? And also it must be present? And it hasn't been guessed? 

   We haven't guessed any letters for position 3? So we need to choose a word that matches the pattern: C A ? E T

   But we must ensure the entire word is valid? 

   Alternatively, we can assume we have the pattern? 

   But wait: we must also check if the second guess feedback already covered this? 

   However, the second guess ""cleat"" was C L E A T? 
        We got: C(✓) L(x) E(-) A(-) T(✓) 

        Now, if the word were C A X E T, then in ""cleat"":
          Position 1: C -> matches? 
          Position 2: L -> but we now think it should be A? So L would be wrong? and we got L(x) -> meaning L is absent? 
          That matches because L is not in the word? 
          Position 3: E -> but in the word, position 3 is X? which if X is not E? then E would be at position 4? so E was guessed at position 3? so feedback says it's not there? -> (?) the E in the word is at position 4, so E at position 3 is absent? So (-) is not applicable? Actually, feedback was E(-) meaning E is present but not at the position? So that matches? Because E is present? but not at position 3? 
          Position 4: A -> but in the word, position 4 is E? so we guessed A at position 4? but the word has E? which is present? but not A at position 4? so A(-) is also correct? because A is present? but in the word A is at position 2? so A is in the word? but not at position 4? 
          Position 5: T -> matches? 

        So feedback fits.

   Therefore, the word is C A ? E T? and the unknown letter at position 3? 

   Now, what letters haven't been excluded? Excluded: R, N, L? Also, we know the letters in the word: C, A, E, T? and one more? 

   We also tried in ""cleat"": L? which is excluded? 

   What other letters have been tested? 
      In ""crane"": we tested C, R, A, N, E -> so we know about A and E? 
      We haven't tested any other letters? So the remaining letters must be almost anything else? 

   But the word must be a valid English word? 

   Let me list words matching C A ? E T pattern? 

   Common words: 
     CABET? -> not a word.
     CADET? -> yes! C A D E T
     CAPET? -> not common? 
     CARET? -> but R is excluded? excluded R? 
     CARTE? -> R excluded? 
     CASTE? -> S? 
     CATER? -> R excluded? 
     CAVET? -> not a word? 

   So CADET is a possibility? 
        Letters: C, A, D, E, T? 
        We have D? which hasn't been tested.

   How about CAFET? -> not a word? 

   So CADET is a valid word? 

   But note: in our pattern, position 4 is E? So CADET is C A D E T? 
        Position 3: D? 

   But does it satisfy the constraints? 
        Position 1: C? -> correct? 
        Position 2: A? -> if the word is CADET? then A at position 2? matches our plan? 
        Position 3: D? new? 
        Position 4: E? 
        Position 5: T? correct? 

   Also, the feedback from first guess: 
        ""crane"": 
          Position 3: A? in CADET, position 3 is D? so A is not at 3? -> correct? and we know A is at 2? 
          Position 5: E? -> CADET has E at position 4? so E is present? but not at 5? -> correct? 
        And CADET has no R? No N? No L? -> so it passes.

   Second guess ""cleat"": 
        Feedback was: C(✓) L(x) (correct, L not in word) E(-) (E at position 3? but CADET has E at position 4? so E is present? but at position 4? so E guessed at 3 is wrong? -> correct) 
                   A(-) (A at position 4? but CADET has A at position 2? so A present? but not at 4? -> correct) T(✓) (correct).

   So CADET fits? 

   But wait: what if there are other words? Like CAVET? Not a valid word? 
   Or CANET? But N is excluded? 

   How about CAMET? 
        CAMET? Not commonly used? 

   Also, CAKET? Not a word? 

   So CADET seems a very strong candidate? 

   Alternatively, CASTE? 
        Let's check: CASTE -> C A S T E? 
        But then position 5? It would be E? But we know position 5 is T? from our feedback? 
        In second guess, we got T(✓) at position 5? So the word must end with T? Therefore, CASTE ends with E? So not CASTE? 

   Also CAPET? Not valid? 

   Therefore, CADET is a strong candidate? 

   But note: in CADET, position 3 is D? 

   However, we have not received any feedback that says D is in the word? So it could be? 

   And there is no competing word? 

   Therefore, our next guess should be CADET? But note: we only have 6 tries? and this might be the solution? 

   Alternatively, we could try to confirm? But since we have only one unknown letter? And we haven't tried D? 

   But why not? We can guess CADET? 

   Alternatively, if we are not sure? but we don't see another word? 

   We should consider: does CADET break any feedback? We don't see any? 

   Therefore, I will guess CADET? 

   But let me double-check the pattern: C A ? E T -> CADET: C A D E T -> matches.

   Also, the word CADET is valid? Yes.

   So next guess: CADET

   However, note that our deduction might be wrong? We are sure that A must be at position 2? 

   Why must A be at position 2? Because A cannot be at position 3 or 4? So only position 2? 

   But what about position 5? Position 5 is T? so A cannot be at position 5? 

   Positions available: 2,3,4? and we know A cannot be at 3 or 4? So only 2? 

   Similarly for E? 
        Positions: 2,3,4? 
        E cannot be at 3? 
        Also position 2: if A is at position 2? then E cannot be at 2? 
        Therefore E must be at position 4? 

   So pattern: C A ? E T? 

   We are missing the letter at position 3? 

   Therefore, CADET is a valid word? 

   I'll go with CADET? 

   But note: we have also learned that E is not at position 3? and A not at 4? 

   CADET: 
        C: matches
        A: matches at position 2? 
        D: an unknown? 
        E: at position 4? 
        T: matches? 

   So we are guessing? 

   Since CADET fits all the clues? 

   Let me write the guess: 

<guess>cadet</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
1. **C(✓)** in both guesses confirms the first letter is **C**.
2. **T(✓)** in the second guess confirms the fifth letter is **T**.
3. **A(-)** in both guesses means **A** is in the word but not in positions 3 (from ""crane"") or 4 (from ""cleat"").
4. **E(-)** means **E** is in the word but not in positions 5 (from ""crane"") or 3 (from ""cleat"").
5. **R(x)**, **N(x)**, and **L(x)** are absent and excluded.

### Deductions:
- **Pattern**: The word must be **C _ _ _ T**.
- **A** must be at position 2 (only remaining position: cannot be 1,3,4, or 5).
- **E** must be at position 4 (only remaining position after excluding 3,5, and position 2 now occupied by A).
- **Position 3** must be a letter not excluded (not R, N, L) and not used elsewhere.  
- Valid English words fitting **C A _ E T**:  
  - **CADET** is confirmed (only common word; e.g., ""CAMET"", ""CAPET"" invalid).

Thus, **CADET** fits all feedback:
- Position 1: **C** ✓  
- Position 2: **A** ✓  
- Position 3: **D** (new, untested)  
- Position 4: **E** ✓  
- Position 5: **T** ✓",Guess 3: cadet -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) D(✓) E(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
