We are making the first guess. Since there is no prior feedback, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word often includes common letters and avoids repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).

 Consider the word ""CRANE"":
   - It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
   - It doesn't repeat letters.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" and ""TRACE"" are also popular.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as the first guess.
</think>
For the first guess, I selected a starting word that maximizes information gain by including common vowels and consonants without repetition. ""CRANE"" was chosen because it contains the vowels 'A' and 'E', and common consonants 'C', 'R', and 'N'. This provides broad coverage of frequent English letters, helping identify correct letters and positions efficiently. It's also a word that often appears in vocabulary-based games.

 Since R is in the second position and E is in the fifth position, the secret word must have the form: _ R _ _ E

 Also, we know that C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 For our next guess, we need to avoid using C, A, and N because they are absent.

 We want to guess a word that fits the pattern _ R _ _ E and uses other common letters to gain more information.

 Let's think of words ending with 'E' and having 'R' in the second position.

 Common letters we can try: besides using R and E in known positions, we can include vowels or consonants that frequently appear.

 We have two unknown positions: first, third, fourth. But note: position fourth is before E, so it's the fourth letter.

 So the pattern: [1]R[3][4]E

 We should choose a word that doesn't have C, A, N and uses new letters to test.

 Possible words: 
   PRICE? But C is not allowed (known to be absent).
   BRIDE: B at first, R second, I third, D fourth, E fifth. Let's check letters: B, I, D are new.
   GRIME: G, I, M
   TRIPE: T, I, P
   etc.

 But also, we need to ensure the word does not contain A, C, N.

 Checking common words: 
   ""BRISE"" isn't common? I think ""bribe"" is a word? But ""bribe"" has B twice? Wait, bribe: positions: B(1), R(2), I(3), B(4) -> but fourth letter is B, then E? So ""bribe"" is five letters? Actually, 'bribe' is spelled B-R-I-B-E: letters are B,R,I,B,E? Fourth is B but we don't know if repeated letters are allowed? Typically Wordle allows repeated letters.

 However, the feedback didn't mention anything about rules against repeats, so they might be allowed.

 But in our case, we haven't encountered any repeats yet.

 Alternatively, let's consider:
   ""BRINE"": not allowed because N is absent? N is marked absent so we can't use it -> so no.
   ""BRIDE"": B R I D E -> pattern _ R _ _ E

 How about ""PRIDE"": P R I D E -> P, I, D are new.

 Another: ""TRICE"" -> but C is absent.

 Best to avoid the absent letters.

 Let's list some candidate words that fit _ R _ _ E and don't have C,A,N:

 Common words:
   bride (if we can use it)
   price (has C -> invalid)
   drive: D R I V E -> D, I, V new -> good.
   grime: G R I M E -> G, I, M
   tribe: T R I B E -> T, I, B
   tripe: T R I P E -> T, I, P

 Since we want to cover common consonants and vowels, we might prefer words with vowels in the unknown positions. We already know that A is absent, so vowels available: E is used at end, but E might appear elsewhere? We know E is at fifth, so it could be elsewhere? However, in the third or fourth position? Our pattern doesn't say E must be only at fifth.

 But note: the feedback for E was only fifth position. It doesn't tell if E appears elsewhere. But since we got one E correct and in position, if there were another E we wouldn't know yet.

 However, we don't have evidence of another E. So let's focus.

 We must test new letters. Let me think about letter frequency:

 After removing C,A,N (and R,E are known present but R and E are fixed in position), we can use:

 Frequent consonants: T, S, L, D, G, B, P, M, etc.
 Vowels: I, O, U (since A and E partially known) but E is used at end, so I, O, U are unknowns.

 We might want to test one vowel and consonants.

 Option: ""BRIDE"" uses B, I, D -> I is a vowel. That might be good.

 We'll choose ""BRIDE"" as it fits and tests B, I, D.

 So next guess: ""bride""

 But wait: the pattern is _ R _ _ E, and ""bride"" is B R I D E -> positions match.

 However, note that in the first guess, the first letter was C (absent) and fifth was E (correct). So ""bride"" has B in first and E in fifth.

 But we don't know if B is in the word. It might be.

 Alternatively, we can try ""DRIVE"", which tests D, I, V.

 And ""D"" is a common consonant.

 Also, note that we are not guaranteed that I is in the word? So we are trying to guess and get feedback.

 We want to maximize information. Since the secret word might contain I or not.

 But we also haven't tested S, T, L, etc.

 Another idea: include more new letters? We have 6 guesses, so we can test.

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that doesn't put a vowel in third position? Because vowels are more variable.

 Let me consider ""TRADE"": not allowed because A is absent -> invalid.

 ""PRUDE"": P R U D E -> pattern? P first, R second, U third, D fourth, E fifth -> and U is a vowel we haven't tested.

 We haven't tested U? Then we can test U? But frequency might be lower.

 Another: ""GRIPE"": G R I P E -> tests G, I, P.

 We could also choose ""PRIDE"": P R I D E -> tests P, I, D.

 Among these, ""PRIDE"" seems common.

 But let me think: since we have two unknown positions: first and third as well as fourth? Wait:

 Pattern: [1] R [3] [4] E

 We have three unknowns: positions 1,3,4.

 In ""PRIDE"": 1=P, 3=I, 4=D -> so tests P,I,D.

 Alternatively, ""TRIPE"": T R I P E -> tests T,I,P.

 We can also test S? How about ""ARISE"" -> but A is absent -> invalid.

 ""WRITE"": W R I T E -> tests W, I, T. W is less common.

 Since R and E are fixed, we can try to include S? But S in which position?

 Pattern: [1]R[3][4]E -> we can put S in position 1? -> ""sprite"" has S but five letters? ""SpritE"" would be S P R I T E -> that's six letters? Wait, no: we need 5-letter words.

 Five-letter words fitting this pattern and without C,A,N:

 Let me list some: 
   bride, bribe? (bribe: B R I B E -> has repeated B? and E at end -> acceptable? We need to see if repetition is allowed. The game rules didn't say anything, so yes.)
   drive: D R I V E
   grime: G R I M E
   gripe: G R I P E
   prise: P R I S E? Prise: common? Yes, meaning to lever open? But also might be a variant of prize. But let's see.
   price: not allowed (C)
   prime: P R I M E -> M tested
   trice: not allowed (C)
   tribe: T R I B E -> B tested
   tripe: T R I P E
   write: W R I T E -> W is not very common.

 I think ""PRIDE"" is a good candidate.

 But note: we got E correct at fifth, and R correct at second. In ""PRIDE"", the fourth letter is D? That might be tested.

 Alternatively, let's choose a word that uses a different vowel if available? We haven't tested I, O, U.

 Since I is common, testing I is good.

 We'll go with ""PRIDE"": because it tests P (common consonant), I (vowel), and D (common consonant).

 So next guess: pride

 But wait, I changed my mind. Why not test S? Because S is very common.

 Possible: ""prise"" -> P R I S E -> same as pride but with S? But ""prise"" is a word meaning to force open? Yes.

 However, note that ""pride"" and ""prise"" both have P and I? But ""pride"" has D, ""prise"" has S.

 For information, S might be better.

 Word ""PRISE"" uses S at position 4? Pattern: P at1, R2, I3, S4, E5 -> so tests P, I, S.

 Compare ""PRIDE"" (tests P,I,D) vs ""PRISE"" (tests P,I,S). S is more frequent than D in English? Yes, S is very common.

 So ""PRISE"" might be better.

 But also: what if we don't use I? For example, we could choose ""PROSE"": P R O S E -> tests O (vowel) and S. But O is a vowel we haven't tested.

 However, we don't know if O is present? So testing a new vowel O might be equivalent to testing I? But I is slightly more common.

 Since we tested E already, and E is present, O or I are equally likely? Not necessarily, but we don't know.

 To maximize consonant tests, we note that S is more useful.

 So ""PRISE"" might be a better guess? But also, note that ""PRISE"" uses the same positions: P at1, R2, I3, S4, E5.

 We'll go with ""PRISE"" because S is a high-frequency letter.

 But wait: the word must be valid. Is ""PRISE"" accepted? It is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""ROUSE""? But R is second, so first must be ? R at second? ""ROUSE"" has R first? -> no, R is at position first? So not matching pattern.

 Pattern must be _ R _ _ E -> so first letter is unknown, second is R, then two letters, then E. So ""r? ? e"" but with R at second? So ""?? E"" pattern is fixed: position1: ?, position2: R, position3: ?, position4: ?, position5: E.

 Therefore, in ""PRISE"", we get: position1=P, position2=R, position3=I, position4=S, position5=E -> matches.

 So ""PRISE"" is a valid guess.

 Also, note: we haven't tested T? How about ""TRUSS""? T R U S S -> pattern: T1, R2, U3, S4, S5? But fifth must be E -> fixed.

 So we cannot break the E at fifth.

 Therefore, we stick to words ending with E.

 We choose ""PRISE"" to test P, I, S.

 Another candidate: ""BRISE""? Meaning: brise? Not common. Better stick to common words.

 Let me confirm: PRISE is valid.

 So we'll guess ""prise"".

 But note: ""PRIDE"" is also common, but ""PRISE"" uses S which has higher frequency? And S might be more beneficial.

 Alternatively, ""GRISE"" meaning to shudder? Rare? So not good.

 So I think ""PRISE"" is acceptable.

 Alternatively, ""TRICE"" is not allowed due to C.

 Therefore, ""PRISE"" it is.

 But wait, what about ""DRIVE""? D, R, I, V, E -> D at first, R second, I third, V fourth, E fifth -> fits. Then we test D, I, V? We haven't tested V? V is less common than S.

 Since S is more frequent, we prefer S.

 We'll go with ""PRISE"".

 But another idea: we could try ""BRUTE"" but at fifth? Pattern: _ R _ _ E -> BRUTE: B at first, R at second, U at third, T at fourth, E at fifth. Tests B,U,T -> T common, U vowel? Not bad. But then we skip I?

 Since we are trying to test letters, we have to pick one.

 I think I'll stick with ""PRISE"" because it includes S, the most common consonant we haven't tested.

 Therefore, next guess: ""prise""

 However, before we decide: we know the word has R and E (specifically, second letter R and fifth letter E). And we know C,A,N are out.

 Letter E: we haven't tested E in other positions? But the word might have E only at the fifth? Or it might have more? But we don't know.

 But in ""PRISE"", E is at fifth only? Actually, the word ends with E.

 So let's commit: ""prise""
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is correct and in position 2.
- E is correct and in position 5.
- C, A, and N are absent.

The secret word must have the form: _ R _ _ E.

For the next guess, I chose a word that fits this pattern, avoids C/A/N, tests new common letters (P, I, S), and maximizes information gain. ""Prise"" (meaning to force open or lever) was selected because:
- It tests P in position 1 and S in position 4, both high-frequency consonants.
- It tests I (a vowel) in position 3.
- It avoids previously absent letters (C/A/N) and reuses known correct E in position 5.

This guess helps cover frequent unused letters while leveraging the fixed R and E positions.

<guess>prise</guess>",prise,"We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane""
 Feedback: C(x) - not in the word, R(✓) - correct and in position, A(x) - not in the word, N(x) - not in the word, E(✓) - correct and in position.
 Since R is in the second position and E is in the fifth position, the secret word must have the form: _ R _ _ E

 Also, we know that C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 For our next guess, we need to avoid using C, A, and N because they are absent.

 We want to guess a word that fits the pattern _ R _ _ E and uses other common letters to gain more information.

 Let's think of words ending with 'E' and having 'R' in the second position.

 Common letters we can try: besides using R and E in known positions, we can include vowels or consonants that frequently appear.

 We have two unknown positions: first, third, fourth. But note: position fourth is before E, so it's the fourth letter.

 So the pattern: [1]R[3][4]E

 We should choose a word that doesn't have C, A, N and uses new letters to test.

 Possible words: 
   PRICE? But C is not allowed (known to be absent).
   BRIDE: B at first, R second, I third, D fourth, E fifth. Let's check letters: B, I, D are new.
   GRIME: G, I, M
   TRIPE: T, I, P
   etc.

 But also, we need to ensure the word does not contain A, C, N.

 Checking common words: 
   ""BRISE"" isn't common? I think ""bribe"" is a word? But ""bribe"" has B twice? Wait, bribe: positions: B(1), R(2), I(3), B(4) -> but fourth letter is B, then E? So ""bribe"" is five letters? Actually, 'bribe' is spelled B-R-I-B-E: letters are B,R,I,B,E? Fourth is B but we don't know if repeated letters are allowed? Typically Wordle allows repeated letters.

 However, the feedback didn't mention anything about rules against repeats, so they might be allowed.

 But in our case, we haven't encountered any repeats yet.

 Alternatively, let's consider:
   ""BRINE"": not allowed because N is absent? N is marked absent so we can't use it -> so no.
   ""BRIDE"": B R I D E -> pattern _ R _ _ E

 How about ""PRIDE"": P R I D E -> P, I, D are new.

 Another: ""TRICE"" -> but C is absent.

 Best to avoid the absent letters.

 Let's list some candidate words that fit _ R _ _ E and don't have C,A,N:

 Common words:
   bride (if we can use it)
   price (has C -> invalid)
   drive: D R I V E -> D, I, V new -> good.
   grime: G R I M E -> G, I, M
   tribe: T R I B E -> T, I, B
   tripe: T R I P E -> T, I, P

 Since we want to cover common consonants and vowels, we might prefer words with vowels in the unknown positions. We already know that A is absent, so vowels available: E is used at end, but E might appear elsewhere? We know E is at fifth, so it could be elsewhere? However, in the third or fourth position? Our pattern doesn't say E must be only at fifth.

 But note: the feedback for E was only fifth position. It doesn't tell if E appears elsewhere. But since we got one E correct and in position, if there were another E we wouldn't know yet.

 However, we don't have evidence of another E. So let's focus.

 We must test new letters. Let me think about letter frequency:

 After removing C,A,N (and R,E are known present but R and E are fixed in position), we can use:

 Frequent consonants: T, S, L, D, G, B, P, M, etc.
 Vowels: I, O, U (since A and E partially known) but E is used at end, so I, O, U are unknowns.

 We might want to test one vowel and consonants.

 Option: ""BRIDE"" uses B, I, D -> I is a vowel. That might be good.

 We'll choose ""BRIDE"" as it fits and tests B, I, D.

 So next guess: ""bride""

 But wait: the pattern is _ R _ _ E, and ""bride"" is B R I D E -> positions match.

 However, note that in the first guess, the first letter was C (absent) and fifth was E (correct). So ""bride"" has B in first and E in fifth.

 But we don't know if B is in the word. It might be.

 Alternatively, we can try ""DRIVE"", which tests D, I, V.

 And ""D"" is a common consonant.

 Also, note that we are not guaranteed that I is in the word? So we are trying to guess and get feedback.

 We want to maximize information. Since the secret word might contain I or not.

 But we also haven't tested S, T, L, etc.

 Another idea: include more new letters? We have 6 guesses, so we can test.

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that doesn't put a vowel in third position? Because vowels are more variable.

 Let me consider ""TRADE"": not allowed because A is absent -> invalid.

 ""PRUDE"": P R U D E -> pattern? P first, R second, U third, D fourth, E fifth -> and U is a vowel we haven't tested.

 We haven't tested U? Then we can test U? But frequency might be lower.

 Another: ""GRIPE"": G R I P E -> tests G, I, P.

 We could also choose ""PRIDE"": P R I D E -> tests P, I, D.

 Among these, ""PRIDE"" seems common.

 But let me think: since we have two unknown positions: first and third as well as fourth? Wait:

 Pattern: [1] R [3] [4] E

 We have three unknowns: positions 1,3,4.

 In ""PRIDE"": 1=P, 3=I, 4=D -> so tests P,I,D.

 Alternatively, ""TRIPE"": T R I P E -> tests T,I,P.

 We can also test S? How about ""ARISE"" -> but A is absent -> invalid.

 ""WRITE"": W R I T E -> tests W, I, T. W is less common.

 Since R and E are fixed, we can try to include S? But S in which position?

 Pattern: [1]R[3][4]E -> we can put S in position 1? -> ""sprite"" has S but five letters? ""SpritE"" would be S P R I T E -> that's six letters? Wait, no: we need 5-letter words.

 Five-letter words fitting this pattern and without C,A,N:

 Let me list some: 
   bride, bribe? (bribe: B R I B E -> has repeated B? and E at end -> acceptable? We need to see if repetition is allowed. The game rules didn't say anything, so yes.)
   drive: D R I V E
   grime: G R I M E
   gripe: G R I P E
   prise: P R I S E? Prise: common? Yes, meaning to lever open? But also might be a variant of prize. But let's see.
   price: not allowed (C)
   prime: P R I M E -> M tested
   trice: not allowed (C)
   tribe: T R I B E -> B tested
   tripe: T R I P E
   write: W R I T E -> W is not very common.

 I think ""PRIDE"" is a good candidate.

 But note: we got E correct at fifth, and R correct at second. In ""PRIDE"", the fourth letter is D? That might be tested.

 Alternatively, let's choose a word that uses a different vowel if available? We haven't tested I, O, U.

 Since I is common, testing I is good.

 We'll go with ""PRIDE"": because it tests P (common consonant), I (vowel), and D (common consonant).

 So next guess: pride

 But wait, I changed my mind. Why not test S? Because S is very common.

 Possible: ""prise"" -> P R I S E -> same as pride but with S? But ""prise"" is a word meaning to force open? Yes.

 However, note that ""pride"" and ""prise"" both have P and I? But ""pride"" has D, ""prise"" has S.

 For information, S might be better.

 Word ""PRISE"" uses S at position 4? Pattern: P at1, R2, I3, S4, E5 -> so tests P, I, S.

 Compare ""PRIDE"" (tests P,I,D) vs ""PRISE"" (tests P,I,S). S is more frequent than D in English? Yes, S is very common.

 So ""PRISE"" might be better.

 But also: what if we don't use I? For example, we could choose ""PROSE"": P R O S E -> tests O (vowel) and S. But O is a vowel we haven't tested.

 However, we don't know if O is present? So testing a new vowel O might be equivalent to testing I? But I is slightly more common.

 Since we tested E already, and E is present, O or I are equally likely? Not necessarily, but we don't know.

 To maximize consonant tests, we note that S is more useful.

 So ""PRISE"" might be a better guess? But also, note that ""PRISE"" uses the same positions: P at1, R2, I3, S4, E5.

 We'll go with ""PRISE"" because S is a high-frequency letter.

 But wait: the word must be valid. Is ""PRISE"" accepted? It is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""ROUSE""? But R is second, so first must be ? R at second? ""ROUSE"" has R first? -> no, R is at position first? So not matching pattern.

 Pattern must be _ R _ _ E -> so first letter is unknown, second is R, then two letters, then E. So ""r? ? e"" but with R at second? So ""?? E"" pattern is fixed: position1: ?, position2: R, position3: ?, position4: ?, position5: E.

 Therefore, in ""PRISE"", we get: position1=P, position2=R, position3=I, position4=S, position5=E -> matches.

 So ""PRISE"" is a valid guess.

 Also, note: we haven't tested T? How about ""TRUSS""? T R U S S -> pattern: T1, R2, U3, S4, S5? But fifth must be E -> fixed.

 So we cannot break the E at fifth.

 Therefore, we stick to words ending with E.

 We choose ""PRISE"" to test P, I, S.

 Another candidate: ""BRISE""? Meaning: brise? Not common. Better stick to common words.

 Let me confirm: PRISE is valid.

 So we'll guess ""prise"".

 But note: ""PRIDE"" is also common, but ""PRISE"" uses S which has higher frequency? And S might be more beneficial.

 Alternatively, ""GRISE"" meaning to shudder? Rare? So not good.

 So I think ""PRISE"" is acceptable.

 Alternatively, ""TRICE"" is not allowed due to C.

 Therefore, ""PRISE"" it is.

 But wait, what about ""DRIVE""? D, R, I, V, E -> D at first, R second, I third, V fourth, E fifth -> fits. Then we test D, I, V? We haven't tested V? V is less common than S.

 Since S is more frequent, we prefer S.

 We'll go with ""PRISE"".

 But another idea: we could try ""BRUTE"" but at fifth? Pattern: _ R _ _ E -> BRUTE: B at first, R at second, U at third, T at fourth, E at fifth. Tests B,U,T -> T common, U vowel? Not bad. But then we skip I?

 Since we are trying to test letters, we have to pick one.

 I think I'll stick with ""PRISE"" because it includes S, the most common consonant we haven't tested.

 Therefore, next guess: ""prise""

 However, before we decide: we know the word has R and E (specifically, second letter R and fifth letter E). And we know C,A,N are out.

 Letter E: we haven't tested E in other positions? But the word might have E only at the fifth? Or it might have more? But we don't know.

 But in ""PRISE"", E is at fifth only? Actually, the word ends with E.

 So let's commit: ""prise""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is correct and in position 2.
- E is correct and in position 5.
- C, A, and N are absent.

The secret word must have the form: _ R _ _ E.

For the next guess, I chose a word that fits this pattern, avoids C/A/N, tests new common letters (P, I, S), and maximizes information gain. ""Prise"" (meaning to force open or lever) was selected because:
- It tests P in position 1 and S in position 4, both high-frequency consonants.
- It tests I (a vowel) in position 3.
- It avoids previously absent letters (C/A/N) and reuses known correct E in position 5.

This guess helps cover frequent unused letters while leveraging the fixed R and E positions.",Guess 2: prise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since there is no prior feedback, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word often includes common letters and avoids repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).

 Consider the word ""CRANE"":
   - It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
   - It doesn't repeat letters.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" and ""TRACE"" are also popular.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as the first guess.For the first guess, I selected a starting word that maximizes information gain by including common vowels and consonants without repetition. ""CRANE"" was chosen because it contains the vowels 'A' and 'E', and common consonants 'C', 'R', and 'N'. This provides broad coverage of frequent English letters, helping identify correct letters and positions efficiently. It's also a word that often appears in vocabulary-based games.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane""
 Feedback: C(x) - not in the word, R(✓) - correct and in position, A(x) - not in the word, N(x) - not in the word, E(✓) - correct and in position.
 Since R is in the second position and E is in the fifth position, the secret word must have the form: _ R _ _ E

 Also, we know that C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 For our next guess, we need to avoid using C, A, and N because they are absent.

 We want to guess a word that fits the pattern _ R _ _ E and uses other common letters to gain more information.

 Let's think of words ending with 'E' and having 'R' in the second position.

 Common letters we can try: besides using R and E in known positions, we can include vowels or consonants that frequently appear.

 We have two unknown positions: first, third, fourth. But note: position fourth is before E, so it's the fourth letter.

 So the pattern: [1]R[3][4]E

 We should choose a word that doesn't have C, A, N and uses new letters to test.

 Possible words: 
   PRICE? But C is not allowed (known to be absent).
   BRIDE: B at first, R second, I third, D fourth, E fifth. Let's check letters: B, I, D are new.
   GRIME: G, I, M
   TRIPE: T, I, P
   etc.

 But also, we need to ensure the word does not contain A, C, N.

 Checking common words: 
   ""BRISE"" isn't common? I think ""bribe"" is a word? But ""bribe"" has B twice? Wait, bribe: positions: B(1), R(2), I(3), B(4) -> but fourth letter is B, then E? So ""bribe"" is five letters? Actually, 'bribe' is spelled B-R-I-B-E: letters are B,R,I,B,E? Fourth is B but we don't know if repeated letters are allowed? Typically Wordle allows repeated letters.

 However, the feedback didn't mention anything about rules against repeats, so they might be allowed.

 But in our case, we haven't encountered any repeats yet.

 Alternatively, let's consider:
   ""BRINE"": not allowed because N is absent? N is marked absent so we can't use it -> so no.
   ""BRIDE"": B R I D E -> pattern _ R _ _ E

 How about ""PRIDE"": P R I D E -> P, I, D are new.

 Another: ""TRICE"" -> but C is absent.

 Best to avoid the absent letters.

 Let's list some candidate words that fit _ R _ _ E and don't have C,A,N:

 Common words:
   bride (if we can use it)
   price (has C -> invalid)
   drive: D R I V E -> D, I, V new -> good.
   grime: G R I M E -> G, I, M
   tribe: T R I B E -> T, I, B
   tripe: T R I P E -> T, I, P

 Since we want to cover common consonants and vowels, we might prefer words with vowels in the unknown positions. We already know that A is absent, so vowels available: E is used at end, but E might appear elsewhere? We know E is at fifth, so it could be elsewhere? However, in the third or fourth position? Our pattern doesn't say E must be only at fifth.

 But note: the feedback for E was only fifth position. It doesn't tell if E appears elsewhere. But since we got one E correct and in position, if there were another E we wouldn't know yet.

 However, we don't have evidence of another E. So let's focus.

 We must test new letters. Let me think about letter frequency:

 After removing C,A,N (and R,E are known present but R and E are fixed in position), we can use:

 Frequent consonants: T, S, L, D, G, B, P, M, etc.
 Vowels: I, O, U (since A and E partially known) but E is used at end, so I, O, U are unknowns.

 We might want to test one vowel and consonants.

 Option: ""BRIDE"" uses B, I, D -> I is a vowel. That might be good.

 We'll choose ""BRIDE"" as it fits and tests B, I, D.

 So next guess: ""bride""

 But wait: the pattern is _ R _ _ E, and ""bride"" is B R I D E -> positions match.

 However, note that in the first guess, the first letter was C (absent) and fifth was E (correct). So ""bride"" has B in first and E in fifth.

 But we don't know if B is in the word. It might be.

 Alternatively, we can try ""DRIVE"", which tests D, I, V.

 And ""D"" is a common consonant.

 Also, note that we are not guaranteed that I is in the word? So we are trying to guess and get feedback.

 We want to maximize information. Since the secret word might contain I or not.

 But we also haven't tested S, T, L, etc.

 Another idea: include more new letters? We have 6 guesses, so we can test.

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that doesn't put a vowel in third position? Because vowels are more variable.

 Let me consider ""TRADE"": not allowed because A is absent -> invalid.

 ""PRUDE"": P R U D E -> pattern? P first, R second, U third, D fourth, E fifth -> and U is a vowel we haven't tested.

 We haven't tested U? Then we can test U? But frequency might be lower.

 Another: ""GRIPE"": G R I P E -> tests G, I, P.

 We could also choose ""PRIDE"": P R I D E -> tests P, I, D.

 Among these, ""PRIDE"" seems common.

 But let me think: since we have two unknown positions: first and third as well as fourth? Wait:

 Pattern: [1] R [3] [4] E

 We have three unknowns: positions 1,3,4.

 In ""PRIDE"": 1=P, 3=I, 4=D -> so tests P,I,D.

 Alternatively, ""TRIPE"": T R I P E -> tests T,I,P.

 We can also test S? How about ""ARISE"" -> but A is absent -> invalid.

 ""WRITE"": W R I T E -> tests W, I, T. W is less common.

 Since R and E are fixed, we can try to include S? But S in which position?

 Pattern: [1]R[3][4]E -> we can put S in position 1? -> ""sprite"" has S but five letters? ""SpritE"" would be S P R I T E -> that's six letters? Wait, no: we need 5-letter words.

 Five-letter words fitting this pattern and without C,A,N:

 Let me list some: 
   bride, bribe? (bribe: B R I B E -> has repeated B? and E at end -> acceptable? We need to see if repetition is allowed. The game rules didn't say anything, so yes.)
   drive: D R I V E
   grime: G R I M E
   gripe: G R I P E
   prise: P R I S E? Prise: common? Yes, meaning to lever open? But also might be a variant of prize. But let's see.
   price: not allowed (C)
   prime: P R I M E -> M tested
   trice: not allowed (C)
   tribe: T R I B E -> B tested
   tripe: T R I P E
   write: W R I T E -> W is not very common.

 I think ""PRIDE"" is a good candidate.

 But note: we got E correct at fifth, and R correct at second. In ""PRIDE"", the fourth letter is D? That might be tested.

 Alternatively, let's choose a word that uses a different vowel if available? We haven't tested I, O, U.

 Since I is common, testing I is good.

 We'll go with ""PRIDE"": because it tests P (common consonant), I (vowel), and D (common consonant).

 So next guess: pride

 But wait, I changed my mind. Why not test S? Because S is very common.

 Possible: ""prise"" -> P R I S E -> same as pride but with S? But ""prise"" is a word meaning to force open? Yes.

 However, note that ""pride"" and ""prise"" both have P and I? But ""pride"" has D, ""prise"" has S.

 For information, S might be better.

 Word ""PRISE"" uses S at position 4? Pattern: P at1, R2, I3, S4, E5 -> so tests P, I, S.

 Compare ""PRIDE"" (tests P,I,D) vs ""PRISE"" (tests P,I,S). S is more frequent than D in English? Yes, S is very common.

 So ""PRISE"" might be better.

 But also: what if we don't use I? For example, we could choose ""PROSE"": P R O S E -> tests O (vowel) and S. But O is a vowel we haven't tested.

 However, we don't know if O is present? So testing a new vowel O might be equivalent to testing I? But I is slightly more common.

 Since we tested E already, and E is present, O or I are equally likely? Not necessarily, but we don't know.

 To maximize consonant tests, we note that S is more useful.

 So ""PRISE"" might be a better guess? But also, note that ""PRISE"" uses the same positions: P at1, R2, I3, S4, E5.

 We'll go with ""PRISE"" because S is a high-frequency letter.

 But wait: the word must be valid. Is ""PRISE"" accepted? It is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""ROUSE""? But R is second, so first must be ? R at second? ""ROUSE"" has R first? -> no, R is at position first? So not matching pattern.

 Pattern must be _ R _ _ E -> so first letter is unknown, second is R, then two letters, then E. So ""r? ? e"" but with R at second? So ""?? E"" pattern is fixed: position1: ?, position2: R, position3: ?, position4: ?, position5: E.

 Therefore, in ""PRISE"", we get: position1=P, position2=R, position3=I, position4=S, position5=E -> matches.

 So ""PRISE"" is a valid guess.

 Also, note: we haven't tested T? How about ""TRUSS""? T R U S S -> pattern: T1, R2, U3, S4, S5? But fifth must be E -> fixed.

 So we cannot break the E at fifth.

 Therefore, we stick to words ending with E.

 We choose ""PRISE"" to test P, I, S.

 Another candidate: ""BRISE""? Meaning: brise? Not common. Better stick to common words.

 Let me confirm: PRISE is valid.

 So we'll guess ""prise"".

 But note: ""PRIDE"" is also common, but ""PRISE"" uses S which has higher frequency? And S might be more beneficial.

 Alternatively, ""GRISE"" meaning to shudder? Rare? So not good.

 So I think ""PRISE"" is acceptable.

 Alternatively, ""TRICE"" is not allowed due to C.

 Therefore, ""PRISE"" it is.

 But wait, what about ""DRIVE""? D, R, I, V, E -> D at first, R second, I third, V fourth, E fifth -> fits. Then we test D, I, V? We haven't tested V? V is less common than S.

 Since S is more frequent, we prefer S.

 We'll go with ""PRISE"".

 But another idea: we could try ""BRUTE"" but at fifth? Pattern: _ R _ _ E -> BRUTE: B at first, R at second, U at third, T at fourth, E at fifth. Tests B,U,T -> T common, U vowel? Not bad. But then we skip I?

 Since we are trying to test letters, we have to pick one.

 I think I'll stick with ""PRISE"" because it includes S, the most common consonant we haven't tested.

 Therefore, next guess: ""prise""

 However, before we decide: we know the word has R and E (specifically, second letter R and fifth letter E). And we know C,A,N are out.

 Letter E: we haven't tested E in other positions? But the word might have E only at the fifth? Or it might have more? But we don't know.

 But in ""PRISE"", E is at fifth only? Actually, the word ends with E.

 So let's commit: ""prise""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is correct and in position 2.
- E is correct and in position 5.
- C, A, and N are absent.

The secret word must have the form: _ R _ _ E.

For the next guess, I chose a word that fits this pattern, avoids C/A/N, tests new common letters (P, I, S), and maximizes information gain. ""Prise"" (meaning to force open or lever) was selected because:
- It tests P in position 1 and S in position 4, both high-frequency consonants.
- It tests I (a vowel) in position 3.
- It avoids previously absent letters (C/A/N) and reuses known correct E in position 5.

This guess helps cover frequent unused letters while leveraging the fixed R and E positions.

We haven\'t tested I, O, U.\n\n Since I is common, testing I is good.\n\n We\'ll go with ""PRIDE"": because it tests P (common consonant), I (vowel), and D (common consonant).\n\n So next guess: pride\n\n But wait, I changed my mind. Why not test S? Because S is very common.\n\n Possible: ""prise"" -> P R I S E -> same as pride but with S? But ""prise"" is a word meaning to force open? Yes.\n\n However, note that ""pride"" and ""prise"" both have P and I? But ""pride"" has D, ""prise"" has S.\n\n For information, S might be better.\n\n Word ""PRISE"" uses S at position 4? Pattern: P at1, R2, I3, S4, E5 -> so tests P, I, S.\n\n Compare ""PRIDE"" (tests P,I,D) vs ""PRISE"" (tests P,I,S). S is more frequent than D in English? Yes, S is very common.\n\n So ""PRISE"" might be better.\n\n But also: what if we don\'t use I? For example, we could choose ""PROSE"": P R O S E -> tests O (vowel) and S. But O is a vowel we haven\'t tested.\n\n However, we don\'t know if O is present? So testing a new vowel O might be equivalent to testing I? But I is slightly more common.\n\n Since we tested E already, and E is present, O or I are equally likely? Not necessarily, but we don\'t know.\n\n To maximize consonant tests, we note that S is more useful.\n\n So ""PRISE"" might be a better guess? But also, note that ""PRISE"" uses the same positions: P at1, R2, I3, S4, E5.\n\n We\'ll go with ""PRISE"" because S is a high-frequency letter.\n\n But wait: the word must be valid. Is ""PRISE"" accepted? It is a valid word.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROUSE""? But R is second, so first must be ? R at second? ""ROUSE"" has R first? -> no, R is at position first? So not matching pattern.\n\n Pattern must be _ R _ _ E -> so first letter is unknown, second is R, then two letters, then E. So ""r? ? e"" but with R at second? So ""?? E"" pattern is fixed: position1: ?, position2: R, position3: ?, position4: ?, position5: E.\n\n Therefore, in ""PRISE"", we get: position1=P, position2=R, position3=I, position4=S, position5=E -> matches.\n\n So ""PRISE"" is a valid guess.\n\n Also, note: we haven\'t tested T? How about ""TRUSS""? T R U S S -> pattern: T1, R2, U3, S4, S5? But fifth must be E -> fixed.\n\n So we cannot break the E at fifth.\n\n Therefore, we stick to words ending with E.\n\n We choose ""PRISE"" to test P, I, S.\n\n Another candidate: ""BRISE""? Meaning: brise? Not common. Better stick to common words.\n\n Let me confirm: PRISE is valid.\n\n So we\'ll guess ""prise"".\n\n But note: ""PRIDE"" is also common, but ""PRISE"" uses S which has higher frequency? And S might be more beneficial.\n\n Alternatively, ""GRISE"" meaning to shudder? Rare? So not good.\n\n So I think ""PRISE"" is acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, ""TRICE"" is not allowed due to C.\n\n Therefore, ""PRISE"" it is.\n\n But wait, what about ""DRIVE""? D, R, I, V, E -> D at first, R second, I third, V fourth, E fifth -> fits. Then we test D, I, V? We haven\'t tested V? V is less common than S.\n\n Since S is more frequent, we prefer S.\n\n We\'ll go with ""PRISE"".\n\n But another idea: we could try ""BRUTE"" but at fifth? Pattern: _ R _ _ E -> BRUTE: B at first, R at second, U at third, T at fourth, E at fifth. Tests B,U,T -> T common, U vowel? Not bad. But then we skip I?\n\n Since we are trying to test letters, we have to pick one.\n\n I think I\'ll stick with ""PRISE"" because it includes S, the most common consonant we haven\'t tested.\n\n Therefore, next guess: ""prise""\n\n However, before we decide: we know the word has R and E (specifically, second letter R and fifth letter E). And we know C,A,N are out.\n\n Letter E: we haven\'t tested E in other positions? But the word might have E only at the fifth? Or it might have more? But we don\'t know.\n\n But in ""PRISE"", E is at fifth only? Actually, the word ends with E.\n\n So let\'s commit: ""prise""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- R is correct and in position 2.\n- E is correct and in position 5.\n- C, A, and N are absent.\n\nThe secret word must have the form: _ R _ _ E.\n\nFor the next guess, I chose a word that fits this pattern, avoids C/A/N, tests new common letters (P, I, S), and maximizes information gain. ""Prise"" (meaning to force open or lever) was selected because:\n- It tests P in position 1 and S in position 4, both high-frequency consonants.\n- It tests I (a vowel) in position 3.\n- It avoids previously absent letters (C/A/N) and reuses known correct E in position 5.\n\nThis guess helps cover frequent unused letters while leveraging the fixed R and E positions.\n\n<guess>prise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: prise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Meaning:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
- C, A, N are not in the word.

Thus, the secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E

Guess 2: prise -> Feedback: P(x) R(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Meaning:
- R (position 2) and E (position 5) are still correct, which we knew.
- P, I, S are not in the word.

So now we know the secret word does NOT contain: C, A, N, P, I, S
And it must have the pattern: _ R _ _ E

Since all other letters in the two guesses are now marked absent, we have more constraints.

We need to choose a new word that:
- Fits the pattern: first letter unknown, second letter R, third letter unknown, fourth letter unknown, fifth letter E.
- Uses only letters that haven't been ruled out. Ruled out: C, A, N, P, I, S.

We must avoid using these absent letters.

Now, consider available letters: The entire alphabet minus the absent ones.
Absent letters: C, A, N, P, I, S.
Available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a valid 5-letter word ending with ""_ R _ _ E""

Also, since E is at the end, we are looking for words like ?R??E.

Common words that fit this pattern and use available letters:

Possibilities:
- GRUEL? But U and E: E is at end? Pattern is _ R _ _ E -> GRUEL: G R U E L -> This would be positions: G1, R2, U3, E4, L5 -> but E4 is wrong? Fifth must be E? So GRUEL has L at fifth? Not matching.

The pattern requires fifth be E, so fourth letter must be something else? For example, the word must be of the form: ? R ? ? E

So the fourth letter is the letter before E? So the word has letters at pos: 1,2,3,4,5 -> 1=?, 2=R, 3=?, 4=?, 5=E

Therefore, we need words that end in R ? ? E? Actually, end with the fifth letter E? So it's ...E at the end.

Examples: 
- TROVE: T R O V E -> T? But check positions: T1, R2, O3, V4, E5. -> pattern fits.
- GROVE: G1 R2 O3 V4 E5 -> fits.
- PROVE? But P is absent -> invalid.
- BRUTE: B1 R2 U3 T4 E5 -> fits. We have U and T available.
- TRUCE? But C absent -> invalid.
- FRAME? A absent -> invalid.

From this, common words:
- GROVE
- TROVE
- BRUTE
- GRIME? But I is absent -> invalid.
- TRITE? T R I T E -> I absent -> invalid.
- TRUCE? C absent -> invalid.
- DRONE? D R O N E -> N absent -> invalid.
- BROME? B R O M E -> M available? But not sure about commonality.
- BROKE: B R O K E -> K available? Yes.

So possible: 
- GROVE (G,R,O,V,E)
- TROVE (T,R,O,V,E)
- BRUTE (B,R,U,T,E)
- BROKE (B,R,O,K,E)
- TRUER? T R U E R -> repeats E? But E is at position fifth? TRUER: T-R-U-E-R -> positions:1=T,2=R,3=U,4=E,5=R -> fourth letter E? But we need fourth to be unknown and fifth to be E? So TRUER ends with R? Not E? -> invalid.

Therefore, focus on words that end with E.

Another: DUCHY? Not matching pattern? D U C H Y -> no? Pattern must be ? R ? ? E.

DROVE: D R O V E -> D available? Yes.

So more: DROVE, GROVE, TROVE, BROKE, BRUTE, etc.

Now, for our next guess, we want to test new letters that are common and resolve possibilities.

We know the secret word must be one of these possibilities? But there might be many, so we need to narrow down.

Available letters: We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we need to use a word that fits the pattern and tests several of these.

For example, if we guess ""TROVE"":
- T, O, V are new.

""BRUTE"": tests B, U,T? But T is in both.

We might choose a word that avoids repeating letters? But repetition might be allowed? However, we haven't encountered any yet.

Prioritize high-frequency letters among the unknowns: O, T, L, D, U, M, etc.

The unknown positions are: first, third, and fourth.

Our next guess should cover as many as possible unused common letters in these positions.

Let me consider:

Option 1: ""GROVE"" -> tests G, O, V
Option 2: ""TROVE"" -> tests T, O, V
Option 3: ""BRUTE"" -> tests B, U, T

We also have ""DROVE"": tests D, O, V
""BROKE"": tests B, O, K

K is less common? O is a vowel and common.

Since we need to differentiate between the possibilities:

If we guess ""GROVE"", what does it tell?
- If G is correct, then it might be the word? Or if O or V are correct? We can get feedback per letter.

Similarly, ""TROVE"": T in position 1, O in position 3, V in position 4.

The position matters.

But we don't know which of these words it might be.

Another idea: choose a word that is different in structure? For example, include another vowel or consonant we suspect.

Also, note that the letter frequencies: O is a vowel that hasn't been tested? Previously we tested A in ""crane"" (absent) and I in ""prise"" (absent), so maybe an O might be present? Or U? Or others.

We have many candidates: GROVE, TROVE, DROVE, BROKE, BRUTE, etc.

We must pick one.

To test a wider range, perhaps choose a word that has letters not in the common options? But we don't know.

How about using L: are there common words? Like ""GRULE"" not a word. ""PRULE""? not. Or ""TROLE"" not word? So no.

M: ""GRUME"" is rare? Probably not. Better not.

So among the common: GROVE, TROVE, BRUTE, BROKE.

We'll pick ""GROVE"" as it is quite common and tests G, O, V? But then we don't test B or U? But we might test in next guesses.

Alternatively, let me see the letter frequency: Among unused letters, common ones: O, T, B, D, U, L, etc.

If we choose ""GROVE"", we test G (not very common but ok), O (common vowel), V (less common). Then we still have to test B, T, U, etc. later.

""BRUTE"" tests B, U, T -> B, U, T: U being vowel, B and T consonants -> might be better? Because T is very common.

Compare:
- ""BRUTE"": B first, U third, T fourth.
- ""TROVE"": T first, O third, V fourth.

If the word is ""BRUTE"" and we guess ""BRUTE"", we win? But also, if we guess something with more coverage.

But ""BRUTE"" lets us test T and B? But U is vowel.

Perhaps guess a word that doesn't necessarily fix the known pattern? But actually we can use a different pattern if we want? But we know the pattern must be _R__E? So no, because we know second is R and fifth is E? So the word must fit that.

We must guess a word that fits the pattern? Actually, not necessarily? When we guess, the feedback will tell us about the letters? So we can guess a word that breaks the pattern? Because if we guess, for example, a word without R in second or E in fifth? But then we know R and E will match? Because they are in the secret word? So if we don't put R second, then it might not be ✓? But we know it must be R✓, E✓, so we should use the pattern? Yes.

Therefore, we stick to the pattern.

I'll choose ""BRUTE"" because it tests B, U, T which includes T (very common) and U (vowel we haven't tested).

Also, B is common.

So guess ""BRUTE"".

But let's confirm: BRUTE is B-R-U-T-E -> positions: B1, R2, U3, T4, E5 -> pattern matches.

Absent letters avoided: no C,A,N,P,I,S.

So this is valid.

Therefore, next guess: brute
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- The secret word has the second letter as R and the fifth letter as E: pattern ""_ R _ _ E"".
- Absent letters to avoid: C, A, N, P, I, S.
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the new guess:
- Selected ""BRUTE"" (B-R-U-T-E) as it fits the pattern ""_ R _ _ E"" and tests new common letters:
  - B (position 1): High-frequency consonant.
  - U (position 3): Untested vowel.
  - T (position 4): High-frequency consonant.
- Avoids ruled-out letters while maximizing information gain on common vowels/consonants.

<guess>brute</guess>",brute,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Meaning:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
- C, A, N are not in the word.

Thus, the secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E

Guess 2: prise -> Feedback: P(x) R(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Meaning:
- R (position 2) and E (position 5) are still correct, which we knew.
- P, I, S are not in the word.

So now we know the secret word does NOT contain: C, A, N, P, I, S
And it must have the pattern: _ R _ _ E

Since all other letters in the two guesses are now marked absent, we have more constraints.

We need to choose a new word that:

Also, since E is at the end, we are looking for words like ?R??E.

Common words that fit this pattern and use available letters:

Possibilities:
- GRUEL? But U and E: E is at end? Pattern is _ R _ _ E -> GRUEL: G R U E L -> This would be positions: G1, R2, U3, E4, L5 -> but E4 is wrong? Fifth must be E? So GRUEL has L at fifth? Not matching.

The pattern requires fifth be E, so fourth letter must be something else? For example, the word must be of the form: ? R ? ? E

So the fourth letter is the letter before E? So the word has letters at pos: 1,2,3,4,5 -> 1=?, 2=R, 3=?, 4=?, 5=E

Therefore, we need words that end in R ? ? E? Actually, end with the fifth letter E? So it's ...E at the end.

Examples: 
- TROVE: T R O V E -> T? But check positions: T1, R2, O3, V4, E5. -> pattern fits.
- GROVE: G1 R2 O3 V4 E5 -> fits.
- PROVE? But P is absent -> invalid.
- BRUTE: B1 R2 U3 T4 E5 -> fits. We have U and T available.
- TRUCE? But C absent -> invalid.
- FRAME? A absent -> invalid.

From this, common words:
- GROVE

- TRITE? T R I T E -> I absent -> invalid.
- TRUCE? C absent -> invalid.
- DRONE? D R O N E -> N absent -> invalid.
- BROME? B R O M E -> M available? But not sure about commonality.
- BROKE: B R O K E -> K available? Yes.

So possible: 
- GROVE (G,R,O,V,E)
- TROVE (T,R,O,V,E)
- BRUTE (B,R,U,T,E)
- BROKE (B,R,O,K,E)
- TRUER? T R U E R -> repeats E? But E is at position fifth? TRUER: T-R-U-E-R -> positions:1=T,2=R,3=U,4=E,5=R -> fourth letter E? But we need fourth to be unknown and fifth to be E? So TRUER ends with R? Not E? -> invalid.

Therefore, focus on words that end with E.

Another: DUCHY? Not matching pattern? D U C H Y -> no? Pattern must be ? R ? ? E.

DROVE: D R O V E -> D available? Yes.

So more: DROVE, GROVE, TROVE, BROKE, BRUTE, etc.

Now, for our next guess, we want to test new letters that are common and resolve possibilities.

We know the secret word must be one of these possibilities? But there might be many, so we need to narrow down.

 A good starting word often includes common letters and avoids repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).

 Consider the word ""CRANE"":
   - It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
   - It doesn't repeat letters.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" and ""TRACE"" are also popular.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as the first guess.For the first guess, I selected a starting word that maximizes information gain by including common vowels and consonants without repetition. ""CRANE"" was chosen because it contains the vowels 'A' and 'E', and common consonants 'C', 'R', and 'N'. This provides broad coverage of frequent English letters, helping identify correct letters and positions efficiently. It's also a word that often appears in vocabulary-based games.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane""
 Feedback: C(x) - not in the word, R(✓) - correct and in position, A(x) - not in the word, N(x) - not in the word, E(✓) - correct and in position.
 Since R is in the second position and E is in the fifth position, the secret word must have the form: _ R _ _ E

 Also, we know that C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 For our next guess, we need to avoid using C, A, and N because they are absent.

 We want to guess a word that fits the pattern _ R _ _ E and uses other common letters to gain more information.

 Let's think of words ending with 'E' and having 'R' in the second position.

 Common letters we can try: besides using R and E in known positions, we can include vowels or consonants that frequently appear.

 We have two unknown positions: first, third, fourth. But note: position fourth is before E, so it's the fourth letter.

 So the pattern: [1]R[3][4]E

 We should choose a word that doesn't have C, A, N and uses new letters to test.

 Possible words: 
   PRICE? But C is not allowed (known to be absent).
   BRIDE: B at first, R second, I third, D fourth, E fifth. Let's check letters: B, I, D are new.
   GRIME: G, I, M
   TRIPE: T, I, P
   etc.

 But also, we need to ensure the word does not contain A, C, N.

 Checking common words: 
   ""BRISE"" isn't common? I think ""bribe"" is a word? But ""bribe"" has B twice? Wait, bribe: positions: B(1), R(2), I(3), B(4) -> but fourth letter is B, then E? So ""bribe"" is five letters? Actually, 'bribe' is spelled B-R-I-B-E: letters are B,R,I,B,E? Fourth is B but we don't know if repeated letters are allowed? Typically Wordle allows repeated letters.

 However, the feedback didn't mention anything about rules against repeats, so they might be allowed.

 But in our case, we haven't encountered any repeats yet.

 Alternatively, let's consider:
   ""BRINE"": not allowed because N is absent? N is marked absent so we can't use it -> so no.
   ""BRIDE"": B R I D E -> pattern _ R _ _ E

 How about ""PRIDE"": P R I D E -> P, I, D are new.

 Another: ""TRICE"" -> but C is absent.

 Best to avoid the absent letters.

 Let's list some candidate words that fit _ R _ _ E and don't have C,A,N:

 Common words:
   bride (if we can use it)
   price (has C -> invalid)
   drive: D R I V E -> D, I, V new -> good.
   grime: G R I M E -> G, I, M
   tribe: T R I B E -> T, I, B
   tripe: T R I P E -> T, I, P

 Since we want to cover common consonants and vowels, we might prefer words with vowels in the unknown positions. We already know that A is absent, so vowels available: E is used at end, but E might appear elsewhere? We know E is at fifth, so it could be elsewhere? However, in the third or fourth position? Our pattern doesn't say E must be only at fifth.

 But note: the feedback for E was only fifth position. It doesn't tell if E appears elsewhere. But since we got one E correct and in position, if there were another E we wouldn't know yet.

 However, we don't have evidence of another E. So let's focus.

 We must test new letters. Let me think about letter frequency:

 After removing C,A,N (and R,E are known present but R and E are fixed in position), we can use:

 Frequent consonants: T, S, L, D, G, B, P, M, etc.
 Vowels: I, O, U (since A and E partially known) but E is used at end, so I, O, U are unknowns.

 We might want to test one vowel and consonants.

 Option: ""BRIDE"" uses B, I, D -> I is a vowel. That might be good.

 We'll choose ""BRIDE"" as it fits and tests B, I, D.

 So next guess: ""bride""

 But wait: the pattern is _ R _ _ E, and ""bride"" is B R I D E -> positions match.

 However, note that in the first guess, the first letter was C (absent) and fifth was E (correct). So ""bride"" has B in first and E in fifth.

 But we don't know if B is in the word. It might be.

 Alternatively, we can try ""DRIVE"", which tests D, I, V.

 And ""D"" is a common consonant.

 Also, note that we are not guaranteed that I is in the word? So we are trying to guess and get feedback.

 We want to maximize information. Since the secret word might contain I or not.

 But we also haven't tested S, T, L, etc.

 Another idea: include more new letters? We have 6 guesses, so we can test.

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that doesn't put a vowel in third position? Because vowels are more variable.

 Let me consider ""TRADE"": not allowed because A is absent -> invalid.

 ""PRUDE"": P R U D E -> pattern? P first, R second, U third, D fourth, E fifth -> and U is a vowel we haven't tested.

 We haven't tested U? Then we can test U? But frequency might be lower.

 Another: ""GRIPE"": G R I P E -> tests G, I, P.

 We could also choose ""PRIDE"": P R I D E -> tests P, I, D.

 Among these, ""PRIDE"" seems common.

 But let me think: since we have two unknown positions: first and third as well as fourth? Wait:

 Pattern: [1] R [3] [4] E

 We have three unknowns: positions 1,3,4.

 In ""PRIDE"": 1=P, 3=I, 4=D -> so tests P,I,D.

 Alternatively, ""TRIPE"": T R I P E -> tests T,I,P.

 We can also test S? How about ""ARISE"" -> but A is absent -> invalid.

 ""WRITE"": W R I T E -> tests W, I, T. W is less common.

 Since R and E are fixed, we can try to include S? But S in which position?

 Pattern: [1]R[3][4]E -> we can put S in position 1? -> ""sprite"" has S but five letters? ""SpritE"" would be S P R I T E -> that's six letters? Wait, no: we need 5-letter words.

 Five-letter words fitting this pattern and without C,A,N:

 Let me list some: 
   bride, bribe? (bribe: B R I B E -> has repeated B? and E at end -> acceptable? We need to see if repetition is allowed. The game rules didn't say anything, so yes.)
   drive: D R I V E
   grime: G R I M E
   gripe: G R I P E
   prise: P R I S E? Prise: common? Yes, meaning to lever open? But also might be a variant of prize. But let's see.
   price: not allowed (C)
   prime: P R I M E -> M tested
   trice: not allowed (C)
   tribe: T R I B E -> B tested
   tripe: T R I P E
   write: W R I T E -> W is not very common.

 I think ""PRIDE"" is a good candidate.

 But note: we got E correct at fifth, and R correct at second. In ""PRIDE"", the fourth letter is D? That might be tested.

 Alternatively, let's choose a word that uses a different vowel if available? We haven't tested I, O, U.

 Since I is common, testing I is good.

 We'll go with ""PRIDE"": because it tests P (common consonant), I (vowel), and D (common consonant).

 So next guess: pride

 But wait, I changed my mind. Why not test S? Because S is very common.

 Possible: ""prise"" -> P R I S E -> same as pride but with S? But ""prise"" is a word meaning to force open? Yes.

 However, note that ""pride"" and ""prise"" both have P and I? But ""pride"" has D, ""prise"" has S.

 For information, S might be better.

 Word ""PRISE"" uses S at position 4? Pattern: P at1, R2, I3, S4, E5 -> so tests P, I, S.

 Compare ""PRIDE"" (tests P,I,D) vs ""PRISE"" (tests P,I,S). S is more frequent than D in English? Yes, S is very common.

 So ""PRISE"" might be better.

 But also: what if we don't use I? For example, we could choose ""PROSE"": P R O S E -> tests O (vowel) and S. But O is a vowel we haven't tested.

 However, we don't know if O is present? So testing a new vowel O might be equivalent to testing I? But I is slightly more common.

 Since we tested E already, and E is present, O or I are equally likely? Not necessarily, but we don't know.

 To maximize consonant tests, we note that S is more useful.

 So ""PRISE"" might be a better guess? But also, note that ""PRISE"" uses the same positions: P at1, R2, I3, S4, E5.

 We'll go with ""PRISE"" because S is a high-frequency letter.

 But wait: the word must be valid. Is ""PRISE"" accepted? It is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""ROUSE""? But R is second, so first must be ? R at second? ""ROUSE"" has R first? -> no, R is at position first? So not matching pattern.

 Pattern must be _ R _ _ E -> so first letter is unknown, second is R, then two letters, then E. So ""r? ? e"" but with R at second? So ""?? E"" pattern is fixed: position1: ?, position2: R, position3: ?, position4: ?, position5: E.

 Therefore, in ""PRISE"", we get: position1=P, position2=R, position3=I, position4=S, position5=E -> matches.

 So ""PRISE"" is a valid guess.

 Also, note: we haven't tested T? How about ""TRUSS""? T R U S S -> pattern: T1, R2, U3, S4, S5? But fifth must be E -> fixed.

 So we cannot break the E at fifth.

 Therefore, we stick to words ending with E.

 We choose ""PRISE"" to test P, I, S.

 Another candidate: ""BRISE""? Meaning: brise? Not common. Better stick to common words.

 Let me confirm: PRISE is valid.

 So we'll guess ""prise"".

 But note: ""PRIDE"" is also common, but ""PRISE"" uses S which has higher frequency? And S might be more beneficial.

 Alternatively, ""GRISE"" meaning to shudder? Rare? So not good.

 So I think ""PRISE"" is acceptable.

 Alternatively, ""TRICE"" is not allowed due to C.

 Therefore, ""PRISE"" it is.

 But wait, what about ""DRIVE""? D, R, I, V, E -> D at first, R second, I third, V fourth, E fifth -> fits. Then we test D, I, V? We haven't tested V? V is less common than S.

 Since S is more frequent, we prefer S.

 We'll go with ""PRISE"".

 But another idea: we could try ""BRUTE"" but at fifth? Pattern: _ R _ _ E -> BRUTE: B at first, R at second, U at third, T at fourth, E at fifth. Tests B,U,T -> T common, U vowel? Not bad. But then we skip I?

 Since we are trying to test letters, we have to pick one.

 I think I'll stick with ""PRISE"" because it includes S, the most common consonant we haven't tested.

 Therefore, next guess: ""prise""

 However, before we decide: we know the word has R and E (specifically, second letter R and fifth letter E). And we know C,A,N are out.

 Letter E: we haven't tested E in other positions? But the word might have E only at the fifth? Or it might have more? But we don't know.

 But in ""PRISE"", E is at fifth only? Actually, the word ends with E.

 So let's commit: ""prise""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is correct and in position 2.
- E is correct and in position 5.
- C, A, and N are absent.

The secret word must have the form: _ R _ _ E.

For the next guess, I chose a word that fits this pattern, avoids C/A/N, tests new common letters (P, I, S), and maximizes information gain. ""Prise"" (meaning to force open or lever) was selected because:
- It tests P in position 1 and S in position 4, both high-frequency consonants.
- It tests I (a vowel) in position 3.
- It avoids previously absent letters (C/A/N) and reuses known correct E in position 5.

This guess helps cover frequent unused letters while leveraging the fixed R and E positions.

<guess>prise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: prise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Meaning:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
- C, A, N are not in the word.

Thus, the secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E

Guess 2: prise -> Feedback: P(x) R(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Meaning:
- R (position 2) and E (position 5) are still correct, which we knew.
- P, I, S are not in the word.

So now we know the secret word does NOT contain: C, A, N, P, I, S
And it must have the pattern: _ R _ _ E

Since all other letters in the two guesses are now marked absent, we have more constraints.

We need to choose a new word that:
- Fits the pattern: first letter unknown, second letter R, third letter unknown, fourth letter unknown, fifth letter E.
- Uses only letters that haven't been ruled out. Ruled out: C, A, N, P, I, S.

We must avoid using these absent letters.

Now, consider available letters: The entire alphabet minus the absent ones.
Absent letters: C, A, N, P, I, S.
Available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a valid 5-letter word ending with ""_ R _ _ E""

Also, since E is at the end, we are looking for words like ?R??E.

Common words that fit this pattern and use available letters:

Possibilities:
- GRUEL? But U and E: E is at end? Pattern is _ R _ _ E -> GRUEL: G R U E L -> This would be positions: G1, R2, U3, E4, L5 -> but E4 is wrong? Fifth must be E? So GRUEL has L at fifth? Not matching.

The pattern requires fifth be E, so fourth letter must be something else? For example, the word must be of the form: ? R ? ? E

So the fourth letter is the letter before E? So the word has letters at pos: 1,2,3,4,5 -> 1=?, 2=R, 3=?, 4=?, 5=E

Therefore, we need words that end in R ? ? E? Actually, end with the fifth letter E? So it's ...E at the end.

Examples: 
- TROVE: T R O V E -> T? But check positions: T1, R2, O3, V4, E5. -> pattern fits.
- GROVE: G1 R2 O3 V4 E5 -> fits.
- PROVE? But P is absent -> invalid.
- BRUTE: B1 R2 U3 T4 E5 -> fits. We have U and T available.
- TRUCE? But C absent -> invalid.
- FRAME? A absent -> invalid.

From this, common words:
- GROVE
- TROVE
- BRUTE
- GRIME? But I is absent -> invalid.
- TRITE? T R I T E -> I absent -> invalid.
- TRUCE? C absent -> invalid.
- DRONE? D R O N E -> N absent -> invalid.
- BROME? B R O M E -> M available? But not sure about commonality.
- BROKE: B R O K E -> K available? Yes.

So possible: 
- GROVE (G,R,O,V,E)
- TROVE (T,R,O,V,E)
- BRUTE (B,R,U,T,E)
- BROKE (B,R,O,K,E)
- TRUER? T R U E R -> repeats E? But E is at position fifth? TRUER: T-R-U-E-R -> positions:1=T,2=R,3=U,4=E,5=R -> fourth letter E? But we need fourth to be unknown and fifth to be E? So TRUER ends with R? Not E? -> invalid.

Therefore, focus on words that end with E.

Another: DUCHY? Not matching pattern? D U C H Y -> no? Pattern must be ? R ? ? E.

DROVE: D R O V E -> D available? Yes.

So more: DROVE, GROVE, TROVE, BROKE, BRUTE, etc.

Now, for our next guess, we want to test new letters that are common and resolve possibilities.

We know the secret word must be one of these possibilities? But there might be many, so we need to narrow down.

Available letters: We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we need to use a word that fits the pattern and tests several of these.

For example, if we guess ""TROVE"":
- T, O, V are new.

""BRUTE"": tests B, U,T? But T is in both.

We might choose a word that avoids repeating letters? But repetition might be allowed? However, we haven't encountered any yet.

Prioritize high-frequency letters among the unknowns: O, T, L, D, U, M, etc.

The unknown positions are: first, third, and fourth.

Our next guess should cover as many as possible unused common letters in these positions.

Let me consider:

Option 1: ""GROVE"" -> tests G, O, V
Option 2: ""TROVE"" -> tests T, O, V
Option 3: ""BRUTE"" -> tests B, U, T

We also have ""DROVE"": tests D, O, V
""BROKE"": tests B, O, K

K is less common? O is a vowel and common.

Since we need to differentiate between the possibilities:

If we guess ""GROVE"", what does it tell?
- If G is correct, then it might be the word? Or if O or V are correct? We can get feedback per letter.

Similarly, ""TROVE"": T in position 1, O in position 3, V in position 4.

The position matters.

But we don't know which of these words it might be.

Another idea: choose a word that is different in structure? For example, include another vowel or consonant we suspect.

Also, note that the letter frequencies: O is a vowel that hasn't been tested? Previously we tested A in ""crane"" (absent) and I in ""prise"" (absent), so maybe an O might be present? Or U? Or others.

We have many candidates: GROVE, TROVE, DROVE, BROKE, BRUTE, etc.

We must pick one.

To test a wider range, perhaps choose a word that has letters not in the common options? But we don't know.

How about using L: are there common words? Like ""GRULE"" not a word. ""PRULE""? not. Or ""TROLE"" not word? So no.

M: ""GRUME"" is rare? Probably not. Better not.

So among the common: GROVE, TROVE, BRUTE, BROKE.

We'll pick ""GROVE"" as it is quite common and tests G, O, V? But then we don't test B or U? But we might test in next guesses.

Alternatively, let me see the letter frequency: Among unused letters, common ones: O, T, B, D, U, L, etc.

If we choose ""GROVE"", we test G (not very common but ok), O (common vowel), V (less common). Then we still have to test B, T, U, etc. later.

""BRUTE"" tests B, U, T -> B, U, T: U being vowel, B and T consonants -> might be better? Because T is very common.

Compare:
- ""BRUTE"": B first, U third, T fourth.
- ""TROVE"": T first, O third, V fourth.

If the word is ""BRUTE"" and we guess ""BRUTE"", we win? But also, if we guess something with more coverage.

But ""BRUTE"" lets us test T and B? But U is vowel.

Perhaps guess a word that doesn't necessarily fix the known pattern? But actually we can use a different pattern if we want? But we know the pattern must be _R__E? So no, because we know second is R and fifth is E? So the word must fit that.

We must guess a word that fits the pattern? Actually, not necessarily? When we guess, the feedback will tell us about the letters? So we can guess a word that breaks the pattern? Because if we guess, for example, a word without R in second or E in fifth? But then we know R and E will match? Because they are in the secret word? So if we don't put R second, then it might not be ✓? But we know it must be R✓, E✓, so we should use the pattern? Yes.

Therefore, we stick to the pattern.

I'll choose ""BRUTE"" because it tests B, U, T which includes T (very common) and U (vowel we haven't tested).

Also, B is common.

So guess ""BRUTE"".

But let's confirm: BRUTE is B-R-U-T-E -> positions: B1, R2, U3, T4, E5 -> pattern matches.

Absent letters avoided: no C,A,N,P,I,S.

So this is valid.

Therefore, next guess: bruteBased on the previous feedback:
- The secret word has the second letter as R and the fifth letter as E: pattern ""_ R _ _ E"".
- Absent letters to avoid: C, A, N, P, I, S.
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the new guess:
- Selected ""BRUTE"" (B-R-U-T-E) as it fits the pattern ""_ R _ _ E"" and tests new common letters:
  - B (position 1): High-frequency consonant.
  - U (position 3): Untested vowel.
  - T (position 4): High-frequency consonant.
- Avoids ruled-out letters while maximizing information gain on common vowels/consonants.

But let\'s see.\n   price: not allowed (C)\n   prime: P R I M E -> M tested\n   trice: not allowed (C)\n   tribe: T R I B E -> B tested\n   tripe: T R I P E\n   write: W R I T E -> W is not very common.\n\n I think ""PRIDE"" is a good candidate.\n\n But note: we got E correct at fifth, and R correct at second. In ""PRIDE"", the fourth letter is D? That might be tested.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s choose a word that uses a different vowel if available? We haven\'t tested I, O, U.\n\n Since I is common, testing I is good.\n\n We\'ll go with ""PRIDE"": because it tests P (common consonant), I (vowel), and D (common consonant).\n\n So next guess: pride\n\n But wait, I changed my mind. Why not test S? Because S is very common.\n\n Possible: ""prise"" -> P R I S E -> same as pride but with S? But ""prise"" is a word meaning to force open? Yes.\n\n However, note that ""pride"" and ""prise"" both have P and I? But ""pride"" has D, ""prise"" has S.\n\n For information, S might be better.\n\n Word ""PRISE"" uses S at position 4? Pattern: P at1, R2, I3, S4, E5 -> so tests P, I, S.\n\n Compare ""PRIDE"" (tests P,I,D) vs ""PRISE"" (tests P,I,S). S is more frequent than D in English? Yes, S is very common.\n\n So ""PRISE"" might be better.\n\n But also: what if we don\'t use I? For example, we could choose ""PROSE"": P R O S E -> tests O (vowel) and S. But O is a vowel we haven\'t tested.\n\n However, we don\'t know if O is present? So testing a new vowel O might be equivalent to testing I? But I is slightly more common.\n\n Since we tested E already, and E is present, O or I are equally likely? Not necessarily, but we don\'t know.\n\n To maximize consonant tests, we note that S is more useful.\n\n So ""PRISE"" might be a better guess? But also, note that ""PRISE"" uses the same positions: P at1, R2, I3, S4, E5.\n\n We\'ll go with ""PRISE"" because S is a high-frequency letter.\n\n But wait: the word must be valid. Is ""PRISE"" accepted? It is a valid word.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROUSE""? But R is second, so first must be ? R at second? ""ROUSE"" has R first? -> no, R is at position first? So not matching pattern.\n\n Pattern must be _ R _ _ E -> so first letter is unknown, second is R, then two letters, then E. So ""r? ? e"" but with R at second? So ""?? E"" pattern is fixed: position1: ?, position2: R, position3: ?, position4: ?, position5: E.\n\n Therefore, in ""PRISE"", we get: position1=P, position2=R, position3=I, position4=S, position5=E -> matches.\n\n So ""PRISE"" is a valid guess.\n\n Also, note: we haven\'t tested T? How about ""TRUSS""? T R U S S -> pattern: T1, R2, U3, S4, S5? But fifth must be E -> fixed.\n\n So we cannot break the E at fifth.\n\n Therefore, we stick to words ending with E.\n\n We choose ""PRISE"" to test P, I, S.\n\n Another candidate: ""BRISE""? Meaning: brise? Not common. Better stick to common words.\n\n Let me confirm: PRISE is valid.\n\n So we\'ll guess ""prise"".\n\n But note: ""PRIDE"" is also common, but ""PRISE"" uses S which has higher frequency? And S might be more beneficial.\n\n Alternatively, ""GRISE"" meaning to shudder? Rare? So not good.\n\n So I think ""PRISE"" is acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, ""TRICE"" is not allowed due to C.\n\n Therefore, ""PRISE"" it is.\n\n But wait, what about ""DRIVE""? D, R, I, V, E -> D at first, R second, I third, V fourth, E fifth -> fits. Then we test D, I, V? We haven\'t tested V? V is less common than S.\n\n Since S is more frequent, we prefer S.\n\n We\'ll go with ""PRISE"".\n\n But another idea: we could try ""BRUTE"" but at fifth? Pattern: _ R _ _ E -> BRUTE: B at first, R at second, U at third, T at fourth, E at fifth. Tests B,U,T -> T common, U vowel? Not bad. But then we skip I?\n\n Since we are trying to test letters, we have to pick one.\n\n I think I\'ll stick with ""PRISE"" because it includes S, the most common consonant we haven\'t tested.\n\n Therefore, next guess: ""prise""\n\n However, before we decide: we know the word has R and E (specifically, second letter R and fifth letter E). And we know C,A,N are out.\n\n Letter E: we haven\'t tested E in other positions? But the word might have E only at the fifth? Or it might have more? But we don\'t know.\n\n But in ""PRISE"", E is at fifth only? Actually, the word ends with E.\n\n So let\'s commit: ""prise""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- R is correct and in position 2.\n- E is correct and in position 5.\n- C, A, and N are absent.\n\nThe secret word must have the form: _ R _ _ E.\n\nFor the next guess, I chose a word that fits this pattern, avoids C/A/N, tests new common letters (P, I, S), and maximizes information gain. ""Prise"" (meaning to force open or lever) was selected because:\n- It tests P in position 1 and S in position 4, both high-frequency consonants.\n- It tests I (a vowel) in position 3.\n- It avoids previously absent letters (C/A/N) and reuses known correct E in position 5.\n\nThis guess helps cover frequent unused letters while leveraging the fixed R and E positions.\n\n<guess>prise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: prise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nMeaning:\n- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).\n- C, A, N are not in the word.\n\nThus, the secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E\n\nGuess 2: prise -> Feedback: P(x) R(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\nMeaning:\n- R (position 2) and E (position 5) are still correct, which we knew.\n- P, I, S are not in the word.\n\nSo now we know the secret word does NOT contain: C, A, N, P, I, S\nAnd it must have the pattern: _ R _ _ E\n\nSince all other letters in the two guesses are now marked absent, we have more constraints.\n\nWe need to choose a new word that:\n- Fits the pattern: first letter unknown, second letter R, third letter unknown, fourth letter unknown, fifth letter E.\n- Uses only letters that haven\'t been ruled out. Ruled out: C, A, N, P, I, S.\n\nWe must avoid using these absent letters.\n\nNow, consider available letters: The entire alphabet minus the absent ones.\nAbsent letters: C, A, N, P, I, S.\nAvailable: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe need to form a valid 5-letter word ending with ""_ R _ _ E""\n\nAlso, since E is at the end, we are looking for words like ?R??E.\n\nCommon words that fit this pattern and use available letters:\n\nPossibilities:\n- GRUEL? But U and E: E is at end? Pattern is _ R _ _ E -> GRUEL: G R U E L -> This would be positions: G1, R2, U3, E4, L5 -> but E4 is wrong? Fifth must be E? So GRUEL has L at fifth? Not matching.\n\nThe pattern requires fifth be E, so fourth letter must be something else? For example, the word must be of the form: ? R ? ? E\n\nSo the fourth letter is the letter before E? So the word has letters at pos: 1,2,3,4,5 -> 1=?, 2=R, 3=?, 4=?, 5=E\n\nTherefore, we need words that end in R ? ? E? Actually, end with the fifth letter E? So it\'s ...E at the end.\n\nExamples: \n- TROVE: T R O V E -> T? But check positions: T1, R2, O3, V4, E5. -> pattern fits.\n- GROVE: G1 R2 O3 V4 E5 -> fits.\n- PROVE? But P is absent -> invalid.\n- BRUTE: B1 R2 U3 T4 E5 -> fits. We have U and T available.\n- TRUCE? But C absent -> invalid.\n- FRAME? A absent -> invalid.\n\nFrom this, common words:\n- GROVE\n- TROVE\n- BRUTE\n- GRIME? But I is absent -> invalid.\n- TRITE? T R I T E -> I absent -> invalid.\n- TRUCE? C absent -> invalid.\n- DRONE? D R O N E -> N absent -> invalid.\n- BROME? B R O M E -> M available? But not sure about commonality.\n- BROKE: B R O K E -> K available? Yes.\n\nSo possible: \n- GROVE (G,R,O,V,E)\n- TROVE (T,R,O,V,E)\n- BRUTE (B,R,U,T,E)\n- BROKE (B,R,O,K,E)\n- TRUER? T R U E R -> repeats E? But E is at position fifth? TRUER: T-R-U-E-R -> positions:1=T,2=R,3=U,4=E,5=R -> fourth letter E? But we need fourth to be unknown and fifth to be E? So TRUER ends with R? Not E? -> invalid.\n\nTherefore, focus on words that end with E.\n\nAnother: DUCHY? Not matching pattern? D U C H Y -> no? Pattern must be ? R ? ? E.\n\nDROVE: D R O V E -> D available? Yes.\n\nSo more: DROVE, GROVE, TROVE, BROKE, BRUTE, etc.\n\nNow, for our next guess, we want to test new letters that are common and resolve possibilities.\n\nWe know the secret word must be one of these possibilities? But there might be many, so we need to narrow down.\n\nAvailable letters: We haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut we need to use a word that fits the pattern and tests several of these.\n\nFor example, if we guess ""TROVE"":\n- T, O, V are new.\n\n""BRUTE"": tests B, U,T? But T is in both.\n\nWe might choose a word that avoids repeating letters? But repetition might be allowed? However, we haven\'t encountered any yet.\n\nPrioritize high-frequency letters among the unknowns: O, T, L, D, U, M, etc.\n\nThe unknown positions are: first, third, and fourth.\n\nOur next guess should cover as many as possible unused common letters in these positions.\n\nLet me consider:\n\nOption 1: ""GROVE"" -> tests G, O, V\nOption 2: ""TROVE"" -> tests T, O, V\nOption 3: ""BRUTE"" -> tests B, U, T\n\nWe also have ""DROVE"": tests D, O, V\n""BROKE"": tests B, O, K\n\nK is less common? O is a vowel and common.\n\nSince we need to differentiate between the possibilities:\n\nIf we guess ""GROVE"", what does it tell?\n- If G is correct, then it might be the word? Or if O or V are correct? We can get feedback per letter.\n\nSimilarly, ""TROVE"": T in position 1, O in position 3, V in position 4.\n\nThe position matters.\n\nBut we don\'t know which of these words it might be.\n\nAnother idea: choose a word that is different in structure? For example, include another vowel or consonant we suspect.\n\nAlso, note that the letter frequencies: O is a vowel that hasn\'t been tested? Previously we tested A in ""crane"" (absent) and I in ""prise"" (absent), so maybe an O might be present? Or U? Or others.\n\nWe have many candidates: GROVE, TROVE, DROVE, BROKE, BRUTE, etc.\n\nWe must pick one.\n\nTo test a wider range, perhaps choose a word that has letters not in the common options? But we don\'t know.\n\nHow about using L: are there common words? Like ""GRULE"" not a word. ""PRULE""? not. Or ""TROLE"" not word? So no.\n\nM: ""GRUME"" is rare? Probably not. Better not.\n\nSo among the common: GROVE, TROVE, BRUTE, BROKE.\n\nWe\'ll pick ""GROVE"" as it is quite common and tests G, O, V? But then we don\'t test B or U? But we might test in next guesses.\n\nAlternatively, let me see the letter frequency: Among unused letters, common ones: O, T, B, D, U, L, etc.\n\nIf we choose ""GROVE"", we test G (not very common but ok), O (common vowel), V (less common). Then we still have to test B, T, U, etc. later.\n\n""BRUTE"" tests B, U, T -> B, U, T: U being vowel, B and T consonants -> might be better? Because T is very common.\n\nCompare:\n- ""BRUTE"": B first, U third, T fourth.\n- ""TROVE"": T first, O third, V fourth.\n\nIf the word is ""BRUTE"" and we guess ""BRUTE"", we win? But also, if we guess something with more coverage.\n\nBut ""BRUTE"" lets us test T and B? But U is vowel.\n\nPerhaps guess a word that doesn\'t necessarily fix the known pattern? But actually we can use a different pattern if we want? But we know the pattern must be _R__E? So no, because we know second is R and fifth is E? So the word must fit that.\n\nWe must guess a word that fits the pattern? Actually, not necessarily? When we guess, the feedback will tell us about the letters? So we can guess a word that breaks the pattern? Because if we guess, for example, a word without R in second or E in fifth? But then we know R and E will match? Because they are in the secret word? So if we don\'t put R second, then it might not be ✓? But we know it must be R✓, E✓, so we should use the pattern? Yes.\n\nTherefore, we stick to the pattern.\n\nI\'ll choose ""BRUTE"" because it tests B, U, T which includes T (very common) and U (vowel we haven\'t tested).\n\nAlso, B is common.\n\nSo guess ""BRUTE"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: BRUTE is B-R-U-T-E -> positions: B1, R2, U3, T4, E5 -> pattern matches.\n\nAbsent letters avoided: no C,A,N,P,I,S.\n\nSo this is valid.\n\nTherefore, next guess: bruteBased on the previous feedback:\n- The secret word has the second letter as R and the fifth letter as E: pattern ""_ R _ _ E"".\n- Absent letters to avoid: C, A, N, P, I, S.\n- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nFor the new guess:\n- Selected ""BRUTE"" (B-R-U-T-E) as it fits the pattern ""_ R _ _ E"" and tests new common letters:\n  - B (position 1): High-frequency consonant.\n  - U (position 3): Untested vowel.\n  - T (position 4): High-frequency consonant.\n- Avoids ruled-out letters while maximizing information gain on common vowels/consonants.\n\n<guess>brute</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: prise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: brute -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) U(x) T(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
  - So R is in position 2, E is in position 5, and C, A, N are absent.

Guess 2: ""prise"" -> P(x), R(✓), I(x), S(x), E(✓)
  - R and E are confirmed again (same positions), and P, I, S are absent.

Guess 3: ""brute"" -> B(x), R(✓), U(x), T(x), E(✓)
  - R and E confirmed, and B, U, T are absent.

So now we know:
- The secret word is of the form: _ R _ _ E
- Absent letters: C, A, N, P, I, S, B, U, T
- Therefore, the available letters are: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ R _ _ E, using only the available letters.

Let's think of possible words:

- The first letter: must be one of D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- The third letter: same set
- The fourth letter: same set

Common words that come to mind:

- ""GROVE"": G R O V E -> but O and V are available? Let's check: O and V are in the available set. However, we haven't used O or V before, so it's possible. But we need to see if it fits the pattern: positions: 1=G, 2=R, 3=O, 4=V, 5=E -> matches.

- ""DROVE"": D R O V E -> D, O, V available? Yes.

- ""TROVE"": T is absent (from guess 3: T(x)), so TROVE is invalid.

- ""PROVE"": P is absent, invalid.

- ""GRACE"": A and C absent, invalid.

- ""FRAME"": A absent, invalid.

- ""WRITE"": I and T absent, invalid.

- ""DRONE"": N absent, invalid.

- ""CRONE"": C and N absent, invalid.

- ""PRONE"": P and N absent, invalid.

- ""BROKE"": B absent (from guess 3: B(x)), and K is available? But B is absent, so BROKE is invalid.

- ""BROME"": B absent and M available? But B is out.

- ""GROVE"" and ""DROVE"" are both possible.

- Also, ""GLOVE"": G L O V E -> L and O available? Yes. Pattern: 1=G, 2=R? No, ""GLOVE"" has L at position 2, not R. So it doesn't fit the pattern (we need R at position 2).

- ""GRAVE"": A absent, invalid.

- ""DROVE"" and ""GROVE"" are the main common ones.

- ""TROVE"" is invalid because T is absent.

- What about ""WROTE""? W R O T E -> but T is absent, so invalid.

- ""WROKE""? Not a common word.

- ""FROZE"": F R O Z E -> F, O, Z available? Z is available? Yes. But is ""FROZE"" a common word? Yes, meaning to freeze. Pattern: 1=F, 2=R, 3=O, 4=Z, 5=E -> matches.

- ""FROME""? Not a word.

- ""GROPE"": P absent, invalid.

- ""GRIME"": I absent, invalid.

- ""DRIVE"": I absent, invalid.

- ""DROOP"": doesn't end with E.

- ""DROLE""? Not common? Drole is not standard English; usually ""droll"" but that ends with L.

- ""DROME"": meaning a racing track? But ends with E? D R O M E -> positions: 1=D, 2=R, 3=O, 4=M, 5=E -> and M is available. So ""DROME"" is a word? Yes, as in aerodrome, but it can be used as a standalone word? It might be accepted.

- ""GROME""? Not a word.

- ""TRODE""? T absent, invalid.

- ""VROOM""? V R O O M -> ends with M, not E.

So the main candidates are:
- GROVE (G, O, V)
- DROVE (D, O, V)
- FROZE (F, O, Z)
- DROME (D, O, M)

We need to choose one to guess. Since we have limited guesses left, we want to pick one that might be the word or give us good information.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 out of 6).

We can try to guess one of these.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained by the pattern and available letters.

For example, if we guess ""GROVE"" and it's not the word, we get feedback on G, O, V.

Similarly for ""DROVE"".

But if we guess a word that has different letters, we might cover more.

However, we don't have many words to choose from.

Another candidate: ""GROPE"" but P is absent.

""GRACE"" but A and C absent.

""WRECK"" doesn't end with E? W R E C K -> no, and C and K? But pattern requires E at end.

""WROTE"" T absent.

""ROGUE"": R O G U E -> but R is at position 1? We need R at position 2. So ""ROGUE"" is R at 1, O at 2? No, pattern must be _ R _ _ E, so position 2 is R. ""ROGUE"" has R at 1, so it doesn't fit.

Similarly, ""ROUSE"" has R at 1 and S absent.

So no.

We might consider ""ORATE"": but A and T absent? A is absent, T is absent? So invalid.

So back to the list.

We can also consider ""GROWL"" doesn't end with E.

Therefore, the most common words are ""GROVE"" and ""DROVE"".

""FROZE"" is also common, especially in the context of freezing.

""DROME"" is less common.

We might prioritize ""GROVE"" or ""DROVE"".

But note: we haven't tested O or V? So if we guess ""GROVE"", we test G, O, V.

Similarly, ""DROVE"" tests D, O, V.

If we guess ""FROZE"", we test F, O, Z.

Since O is common, it might be in the word? But we don't know.

We can also think: if we guess ""GROVE"" and it's wrong, we know about G, O, V.

But we have to use one.

Another idea: what about ""ROWDY""? Doesn't end with E.

""ROWED"": R O W E D -> but pattern: 1=R? We need position 2 to be R? ""ROWED"" has R at 1, O at 2? So position 2 is O, not R? So it doesn't fit the pattern.

We must have position 2 as R.

So let's choose ""GROVE"" as it is a common word.

But we have ""DROVE"" as well.

To decide, note that in ""GROVE"" we test G, which we haven't tested, and in ""DROVE"" we test D, which we haven't tested.

D is more common than G? In English, D is more frequent than G.

But both are possible.

We can also consider the possibility of the word being ""FROZE"" or ""DROME"", but they are less common.

I think ""GROVE"" and ""DROVE"" are the top candidates.

Let me check the frequency: ""DROVE"" might be more common as the past tense of drive.

But ""GROVE"" is also common.

We'll go with ""DROVE"" because D is a very common starting letter.

So guess ""DROVE"".

But let's see: if we guess ""DROVE"", and it's not the word, we get feedback on D, O, V.

Then we can use that to distinguish.

Similarly, if we guess ""GROVE"", same thing.

But we have to pick one.

Another candidate: ""GROVE"" has G, which might be less common? But it's a word.

I think I'll choose ""GROVE"" to test G.

But let's see the available letters: we have many, but we need to cover.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn't use O? Because if O is not in the word, then we can eliminate it.

But we don't know.

For example, is there a word without O?

What about ""GRACE""? No, A and C absent.

""GREET"": E is at the end, but we have E at position 5, and we need to test the third and fourth. ""GREET"": G R E E T -> but T is absent, and also E at position 3? But we have E at position 5, but the word might have another E? However, in ""GREET"", position 3 is E, which we don't know about? But we haven't tested E in other positions? But in the first guess, E was at position 5 and correct, but it doesn't say if there are other E's.

In the feedback, for ""crane"", E was at position 5 and correct, but we don't know about other positions.

Similarly, in ""prise"" and ""brute"", E was at position 5 and correct.

But we never tested E in other positions? So it's possible that E appears elsewhere? But in the pattern, we have position 5 fixed as E, but other positions could be E? However, in the absent letters, we only know that C,A,N,P,I,S,B,U,T are absent, but E is present at least once.

But we don't know if there is a second E.

For example, the word could be ""GREET"", but T is absent, so invalid.

""CREME"": C absent, invalid.

""FREED"": F R E E D -> pattern: 1=F, 2=R, 3=E, 4=E, 5=D? But we need E at position 5? So no, because position 5 must be E? So ""FREED"" ends with D, not E.

""BREED"": B absent, and ends with D.

""GREEN"": G R E E N -> but N absent.

So no common words with E in position 3 or 4? Because position 5 is E, so if there is another E, it must be in position 3 or 4.

But with the absent letters, it's hard to find such a word.

For example, ""PREYE""? Not a word.

""TREED"": T absent, and ends with D.

So probably, the word does not have a second E? Or if it does, it's rare.

Therefore, we focus on words with O or other vowels.

Back to ""GROVE"", ""DROVE"", etc.

We also have ""WROTE"" but T absent.

""CRWTH""? Not ending with E.

I think we should go with ""GROVE"".

Or to test more letters, but we can't.

Another word: ""DROLE""? Not common, and L is available? But ""drole"" is not standard; usually ""droll"".

""ROULE""? Not a word.

So I think ""GROVE"" is a good guess.

But let's choose ""DROVE"" because D is more common.

I'll go with ""DROVE"".

So next guess: drove

But in the feedback, we have to see.

We are on guess 4.

So <guess>drove</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E (R in position 2, E in position 5).
- Absent letters: C, A, N, P, I, S, B, U, T (eliminated from guesses 1-3).
- Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the new guess, I selected ""DROVE"" (D-R-O-V-E) because:
- It fits the known pattern (_ R _ _ E) with D in position 1, O in position 3, and V in position 4.
- It tests three new common letters: D (high-frequency consonant), O (untested vowel), and V (consonant).
- It avoids all ruled-out letters and maximizes information gain by covering frequent unused letters.
- Common words like ""GROVE"" and ""DROVE"" are top candidates; ""DROVE"" was chosen as it tests D (more common than G in ""GROVE"") and helps differentiate between possibilities efficiently.

<guess>drove</guess>",drove,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
  - So R is in position 2, E is in position 5, and C, A, N are absent.

Guess 2: ""prise"" -> P(x), R(✓), I(x), S(x), E(✓)
  - R and E are confirmed again (same positions), and P, I, S are absent.

Guess 3: ""brute"" -> B(x), R(✓), U(x), T(x), E(✓)
  - R and E confirmed, and B, U, T are absent.

So now we know:
- The secret word is of the form: _ R _ _ E
- Absent letters: C, A, N, P, I, S, B, U, T
- Therefore, the available letters are: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ R _ _ E, using only the available letters.

Let's think of possible words:

- The first letter: must be one of D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- The third letter: same set
- The fourth letter: same set

Common words that come to mind:

- ""GROVE"": G R O V E -> but O and V are available? Let's check: O and V are in the available set. However, we haven't used O or V before, so it's possible. But we need to see if it fits the pattern: positions: 1=G, 2=R, 3=O, 4=V, 5=E -> matches.

- ""DROVE"": D R O V E -> D, O, V available? Yes.

- ""TROVE"": T is absent (from guess 3: T(x)), so TROVE is invalid.

- ""PROVE"": P is absent, invalid.

- ""GRACE"": A and C absent, invalid.

- ""FRAME"": A absent, invalid.

- ""WRITE"": I and T absent, invalid.

- ""DRONE"": N absent, invalid.

- ""CRONE"": C and N absent, invalid.

- ""PRONE"": P and N absent, invalid.

- ""BROKE"": B absent (from guess 3: B(x)), and K is available? But B is absent, so BROKE is invalid.

- ""BROME"": B absent and M available? But B is out.

- ""GROVE"" and ""DROVE"" are both possible.

- Also, ""GLOVE"": G L O V E -> L and O available? Yes. Pattern: 1=G, 2=R? No, ""GLOVE"" has L at position 2, not R. So it doesn't fit the pattern (we need R at position 2).

- ""GRAVE"": A absent, invalid.

- ""DROVE"" and ""GROVE"" are the main common ones.

- ""TROVE"" is invalid because T is absent.

- What about ""WROTE""? W R O T E -> but T is absent, so invalid.

- ""WROKE""? Not a common word.

- ""FROZE"": F R O Z E -> F, O, Z available? Z is available? Yes. But is ""FROZE"" a common word? Yes, meaning to freeze. Pattern: 1=F, 2=R, 3=O, 4=Z, 5=E -> matches.

- ""FROME""? Not a word.

- ""GROPE"": P absent, invalid.

- ""GRIME"": I absent, invalid.

- ""DRIVE"": I absent, invalid.

- ""DROOP"": doesn't end with E.

- ""DROLE""? Not common? Drole is not standard English; usually ""droll"" but that ends with L.

- ""DROME"": meaning a racing track? But ends with E? D R O M E -> positions: 1=D, 2=R, 3=O, 4=M, 5=E -> and M is available. So ""DROME"" is a word? Yes, as in aerodrome, but it can be used as a standalone word? It might be accepted.

- ""GROME""? Not a word.

- ""TRODE""? T absent, invalid.

- ""VROOM""? V R O O M -> ends with M, not E.

So the main candidates are:
- GROVE (G, O, V)
- DROVE (D, O, V)
- FROZE (F, O, Z)
- DROME (D, O, M)

We need to choose one to guess. Since we have limited guesses left, we want to pick one that might be the word or give us good information.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 out of 6).

We can try to guess one of these.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained by the pattern and available letters.

For example, if we guess ""GROVE"" and it's not the word, we get feedback on G, O, V.

Similarly for ""DROVE"".

But if we guess a word that has different letters, we might cover more.

However, we don't have many words to choose from.

Another candidate: ""GROPE"" but P is absent.

""GRACE"" but A and C absent.

""WRECK"" doesn't end with E? W R E C K -> no, and C and K? But pattern requires E at end.

""WROTE"" T absent.

""ROGUE"": R O G U E -> but R is at position 1? We need R at position 2. So ""ROGUE"" is R at 1, O at 2? No, pattern must be _ R _ _ E, so position 2 is R. ""ROGUE"" has R at 1, so it doesn't fit.

Similarly, ""ROUSE"" has R at 1 and S absent.

So no.

We might consider ""ORATE"": but A and T absent? A is absent, T is absent? So invalid.

So back to the list.

We can also consider ""GROWL"" doesn't end with E.

Therefore, the most common words are ""GROVE"" and ""DROVE"".

""FROZE"" is also common, especially in the context of freezing.

""DROME"" is less common.

We might prioritize ""GROVE"" or ""DROVE"".

But note: we haven't tested O or V? So if we guess ""GROVE"", we test G, O, V.

Similarly, ""DROVE"" tests D, O, V.

If we guess ""FROZE"", we test F, O, Z.

Since O is common, it might be in the word? But we don't know.

We can also think: if we guess ""GROVE"" and it's wrong, we know about G, O, V.

But we have to use one.

Another idea: what about ""ROWDY""? Doesn't end with E.

""ROWED"": R O W E D -> but pattern: 1=R? We need position 2 to be R? ""ROWED"" has R at 1, O at 2? So position 2 is O, not R? So it doesn't fit the pattern.

We must have position 2 as R.

So let's choose ""GROVE"" as it is a common word.

But we have ""DROVE"" as well.

To decide, note that in ""GROVE"" we test G, which we haven't tested, and in ""DROVE"" we test D, which we haven't tested.

D is more common than G? In English, D is more frequent than G.

But both are possible.

We can also consider the possibility of the word being ""FROZE"" or ""DROME"", but they are less common.

I think ""GROVE"" and ""DROVE"" are the top candidates.

Let me check the frequency: ""DROVE"" might be more common as the past tense of drive.

But ""GROVE"" is also common.

We'll go with ""DROVE"" because D is a very common starting letter.

So guess ""DROVE"".

But let's see: if we guess ""DROVE"", and it's not the word, we get feedback on D, O, V.

Then we can use that to distinguish.

Similarly, if we guess ""GROVE"", same thing.

But we have to pick one.

Another candidate: ""GROVE"" has G, which might be less common? But it's a word.

I think I'll choose ""GROVE"" to test G.

But let's see the available letters: we have many, but we need to cover.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn't use O? Because if O is not in the word, then we can eliminate it.

But we don't know.

For example, is there a word without O?

What about ""GRACE""? No, A and C absent.

""GREET"": E is at the end, but we have E at position 5, and we need to test the third and fourth. ""GREET"": G R E E T -> but T is absent, and also E at position 3? But we have E at position 5, but the word might have another E? However, in ""GREET"", position 3 is E, which we don't know about? But we haven't tested E in other positions? But in the first guess, E was at position 5 and correct, but it doesn't say if there are other E's.

In the feedback, for ""crane"", E was at position 5 and correct, but we don't know about other positions.

Similarly, in ""prise"" and ""brute"", E was at position 5 and correct.

But we never tested E in other positions? So it's possible that E appears elsewhere? But in the pattern, we have position 5 fixed as E, but other positions could be E? However, in the absent letters, we only know that C,A,N,P,I,S,B,U,T are absent, but E is present at least once.

But we don't know if there is a second E.

For example, the word could be ""GREET"", but T is absent, so invalid.

""CREME"": C absent, invalid.

""FREED"": F R E E D -> pattern: 1=F, 2=R, 3=E, 4=E, 5=D? But we need E at position 5? So no, because position 5 must be E? So ""FREED"" ends with D, not E.

""BREED"": B absent, and ends with D.

""GREEN"": G R E E N -> but N absent.

So no common words with E in position 3 or 4? Because position 5 is E, so if there is another E, it must be in position 3 or 4.

But with the absent letters, it's hard to find such a word.

For example, ""PREYE""? Not a word.

""TREED"": T absent, and ends with D.

So probably, the word does not have a second E? Or if it does, it's rare.

Therefore, we focus on words with O or other vowels.

Back to ""GROVE"", ""DROVE"", etc.

We also have ""WROTE"" but T absent.

""CRWTH""? Not ending with E.

I think we should go with ""GROVE"".

Or to test more letters, but we can't.

Another word: ""DROLE""? Not common, and L is available? But ""drole"" is not standard; usually ""droll"".

""ROULE""? Not a word.

So I think ""GROVE"" is a good guess.

But let's choose ""DROVE"" because D is more common.

I'll go with ""DROVE"".

So next guess: drove

But in the feedback, we have to see.

We are on guess 4.

So <guess>drove</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E (R in position 2, E in position 5).
- Absent letters: C, A, N, P, I, S, B, U, T (eliminated from guesses 1-3).
- Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the new guess, I selected ""DROVE"" (D-R-O-V-E) because:
- It fits the known pattern (_ R _ _ E) with D in position 1, O in position 3, and V in position 4.
- It tests three new common letters: D (high-frequency consonant), O (untested vowel), and V (consonant).
- It avoids all ruled-out letters and maximizes information gain by covering frequent unused letters.
- Common words like ""GROVE"" and ""DROVE"" are top candidates; ""DROVE"" was chosen as it tests D (more common than G in ""GROVE"") and helps differentiate between possibilities efficiently.",Guess 4: drove -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since there is no prior feedback, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word often includes common letters and avoids repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).

 Consider the word ""CRANE"":
   - It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
   - It doesn't repeat letters.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" and ""TRACE"" are also popular.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as the first guess.For the first guess, I selected a starting word that maximizes information gain by including common vowels and consonants without repetition. ""CRANE"" was chosen because it contains the vowels 'A' and 'E', and common consonants 'C', 'R', and 'N'. This provides broad coverage of frequent English letters, helping identify correct letters and positions efficiently. It's also a word that often appears in vocabulary-based games.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane""
 Feedback: C(x) - not in the word, R(✓) - correct and in position, A(x) - not in the word, N(x) - not in the word, E(✓) - correct and in position.
 Since R is in the second position and E is in the fifth position, the secret word must have the form: _ R _ _ E

 Also, we know that C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 For our next guess, we need to avoid using C, A, and N because they are absent.

 We want to guess a word that fits the pattern _ R _ _ E and uses other common letters to gain more information.

 Let's think of words ending with 'E' and having 'R' in the second position.

 Common letters we can try: besides using R and E in known positions, we can include vowels or consonants that frequently appear.

 We have two unknown positions: first, third, fourth. But note: position fourth is before E, so it's the fourth letter.

 So the pattern: [1]R[3][4]E

 We should choose a word that doesn't have C, A, N and uses new letters to test.

 Possible words: 
   PRICE? But C is not allowed (known to be absent).
   BRIDE: B at first, R second, I third, D fourth, E fifth. Let's check letters: B, I, D are new.
   GRIME: G, I, M
   TRIPE: T, I, P
   etc.

 But also, we need to ensure the word does not contain A, C, N.

 Checking common words: 
   ""BRISE"" isn't common? I think ""bribe"" is a word? But ""bribe"" has B twice? Wait, bribe: positions: B(1), R(2), I(3), B(4) -> but fourth letter is B, then E? So ""bribe"" is five letters? Actually, 'bribe' is spelled B-R-I-B-E: letters are B,R,I,B,E? Fourth is B but we don't know if repeated letters are allowed? Typically Wordle allows repeated letters.

 However, the feedback didn't mention anything about rules against repeats, so they might be allowed.

 But in our case, we haven't encountered any repeats yet.

 Alternatively, let's consider:
   ""BRINE"": not allowed because N is absent? N is marked absent so we can't use it -> so no.
   ""BRIDE"": B R I D E -> pattern _ R _ _ E

 How about ""PRIDE"": P R I D E -> P, I, D are new.

 Another: ""TRICE"" -> but C is absent.

 Best to avoid the absent letters.

 Let's list some candidate words that fit _ R _ _ E and don't have C,A,N:

 Common words:
   bride (if we can use it)
   price (has C -> invalid)
   drive: D R I V E -> D, I, V new -> good.
   grime: G R I M E -> G, I, M
   tribe: T R I B E -> T, I, B
   tripe: T R I P E -> T, I, P

 Since we want to cover common consonants and vowels, we might prefer words with vowels in the unknown positions. We already know that A is absent, so vowels available: E is used at end, but E might appear elsewhere? We know E is at fifth, so it could be elsewhere? However, in the third or fourth position? Our pattern doesn't say E must be only at fifth.

 But note: the feedback for E was only fifth position. It doesn't tell if E appears elsewhere. But since we got one E correct and in position, if there were another E we wouldn't know yet.

 However, we don't have evidence of another E. So let's focus.

 We must test new letters. Let me think about letter frequency:

 After removing C,A,N (and R,E are known present but R and E are fixed in position), we can use:

 Frequent consonants: T, S, L, D, G, B, P, M, etc.
 Vowels: I, O, U (since A and E partially known) but E is used at end, so I, O, U are unknowns.

 We might want to test one vowel and consonants.

 Option: ""BRIDE"" uses B, I, D -> I is a vowel. That might be good.

 We'll choose ""BRIDE"" as it fits and tests B, I, D.

 So next guess: ""bride""

 But wait: the pattern is _ R _ _ E, and ""bride"" is B R I D E -> positions match.

 However, note that in the first guess, the first letter was C (absent) and fifth was E (correct). So ""bride"" has B in first and E in fifth.

 But we don't know if B is in the word. It might be.

 Alternatively, we can try ""DRIVE"", which tests D, I, V.

 And ""D"" is a common consonant.

 Also, note that we are not guaranteed that I is in the word? So we are trying to guess and get feedback.

 We want to maximize information. Since the secret word might contain I or not.

 But we also haven't tested S, T, L, etc.

 Another idea: include more new letters? We have 6 guesses, so we can test.

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that doesn't put a vowel in third position? Because vowels are more variable.

 Let me consider ""TRADE"": not allowed because A is absent -> invalid.

 ""PRUDE"": P R U D E -> pattern? P first, R second, U third, D fourth, E fifth -> and U is a vowel we haven't tested.

 We haven't tested U? Then we can test U? But frequency might be lower.

 Another: ""GRIPE"": G R I P E -> tests G, I, P.

 We could also choose ""PRIDE"": P R I D E -> tests P, I, D.

 Among these, ""PRIDE"" seems common.

 But let me think: since we have two unknown positions: first and third as well as fourth? Wait:

 Pattern: [1] R [3] [4] E

 We have three unknowns: positions 1,3,4.

 In ""PRIDE"": 1=P, 3=I, 4=D -> so tests P,I,D.

 Alternatively, ""TRIPE"": T R I P E -> tests T,I,P.

 We can also test S? How about ""ARISE"" -> but A is absent -> invalid.

 ""WRITE"": W R I T E -> tests W, I, T. W is less common.

 Since R and E are fixed, we can try to include S? But S in which position?

 Pattern: [1]R[3][4]E -> we can put S in position 1? -> ""sprite"" has S but five letters? ""SpritE"" would be S P R I T E -> that's six letters? Wait, no: we need 5-letter words.

 Five-letter words fitting this pattern and without C,A,N:

 Let me list some: 
   bride, bribe? (bribe: B R I B E -> has repeated B? and E at end -> acceptable? We need to see if repetition is allowed. The game rules didn't say anything, so yes.)
   drive: D R I V E
   grime: G R I M E
   gripe: G R I P E
   prise: P R I S E? Prise: common? Yes, meaning to lever open? But also might be a variant of prize. But let's see.
   price: not allowed (C)
   prime: P R I M E -> M tested
   trice: not allowed (C)
   tribe: T R I B E -> B tested
   tripe: T R I P E
   write: W R I T E -> W is not very common.

 I think ""PRIDE"" is a good candidate.

 But note: we got E correct at fifth, and R correct at second. In ""PRIDE"", the fourth letter is D? That might be tested.

 Alternatively, let's choose a word that uses a different vowel if available? We haven't tested I, O, U.

 Since I is common, testing I is good.

 We'll go with ""PRIDE"": because it tests P (common consonant), I (vowel), and D (common consonant).

 So next guess: pride

 But wait, I changed my mind. Why not test S? Because S is very common.

 Possible: ""prise"" -> P R I S E -> same as pride but with S? But ""prise"" is a word meaning to force open? Yes.

 However, note that ""pride"" and ""prise"" both have P and I? But ""pride"" has D, ""prise"" has S.

 For information, S might be better.

 Word ""PRISE"" uses S at position 4? Pattern: P at1, R2, I3, S4, E5 -> so tests P, I, S.

 Compare ""PRIDE"" (tests P,I,D) vs ""PRISE"" (tests P,I,S). S is more frequent than D in English? Yes, S is very common.

 So ""PRISE"" might be better.

 But also: what if we don't use I? For example, we could choose ""PROSE"": P R O S E -> tests O (vowel) and S. But O is a vowel we haven't tested.

 However, we don't know if O is present? So testing a new vowel O might be equivalent to testing I? But I is slightly more common.

 Since we tested E already, and E is present, O or I are equally likely? Not necessarily, but we don't know.

 To maximize consonant tests, we note that S is more useful.

 So ""PRISE"" might be a better guess? But also, note that ""PRISE"" uses the same positions: P at1, R2, I3, S4, E5.

 We'll go with ""PRISE"" because S is a high-frequency letter.

 But wait: the word must be valid. Is ""PRISE"" accepted? It is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""ROUSE""? But R is second, so first must be ? R at second? ""ROUSE"" has R first? -> no, R is at position first? So not matching pattern.

 Pattern must be _ R _ _ E -> so first letter is unknown, second is R, then two letters, then E. So ""r? ? e"" but with R at second? So ""?? E"" pattern is fixed: position1: ?, position2: R, position3: ?, position4: ?, position5: E.

 Therefore, in ""PRISE"", we get: position1=P, position2=R, position3=I, position4=S, position5=E -> matches.

 So ""PRISE"" is a valid guess.

 Also, note: we haven't tested T? How about ""TRUSS""? T R U S S -> pattern: T1, R2, U3, S4, S5? But fifth must be E -> fixed.

 So we cannot break the E at fifth.

 Therefore, we stick to words ending with E.

 We choose ""PRISE"" to test P, I, S.

 Another candidate: ""BRISE""? Meaning: brise? Not common. Better stick to common words.

 Let me confirm: PRISE is valid.

 So we'll guess ""prise"".

 But note: ""PRIDE"" is also common, but ""PRISE"" uses S which has higher frequency? And S might be more beneficial.

 Alternatively, ""GRISE"" meaning to shudder? Rare? So not good.

 So I think ""PRISE"" is acceptable.

 Alternatively, ""TRICE"" is not allowed due to C.

 Therefore, ""PRISE"" it is.

 But wait, what about ""DRIVE""? D, R, I, V, E -> D at first, R second, I third, V fourth, E fifth -> fits. Then we test D, I, V? We haven't tested V? V is less common than S.

 Since S is more frequent, we prefer S.

 We'll go with ""PRISE"".

 But another idea: we could try ""BRUTE"" but at fifth? Pattern: _ R _ _ E -> BRUTE: B at first, R at second, U at third, T at fourth, E at fifth. Tests B,U,T -> T common, U vowel? Not bad. But then we skip I?

 Since we are trying to test letters, we have to pick one.

 I think I'll stick with ""PRISE"" because it includes S, the most common consonant we haven't tested.

 Therefore, next guess: ""prise""

 However, before we decide: we know the word has R and E (specifically, second letter R and fifth letter E). And we know C,A,N are out.

 Letter E: we haven't tested E in other positions? But the word might have E only at the fifth? Or it might have more? But we don't know.

 But in ""PRISE"", E is at fifth only? Actually, the word ends with E.

 So let's commit: ""prise""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is correct and in position 2.
- E is correct and in position 5.
- C, A, and N are absent.

The secret word must have the form: _ R _ _ E.

For the next guess, I chose a word that fits this pattern, avoids C/A/N, tests new common letters (P, I, S), and maximizes information gain. ""Prise"" (meaning to force open or lever) was selected because:
- It tests P in position 1 and S in position 4, both high-frequency consonants.
- It tests I (a vowel) in position 3.
- It avoids previously absent letters (C/A/N) and reuses known correct E in position 5.

This guess helps cover frequent unused letters while leveraging the fixed R and E positions.

<guess>prise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: prise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Meaning:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
- C, A, N are not in the word.

Thus, the secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E

Guess 2: prise -> Feedback: P(x) R(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Meaning:
- R (position 2) and E (position 5) are still correct, which we knew.
- P, I, S are not in the word.

So now we know the secret word does NOT contain: C, A, N, P, I, S
And it must have the pattern: _ R _ _ E

Since all other letters in the two guesses are now marked absent, we have more constraints.

We need to choose a new word that:
- Fits the pattern: first letter unknown, second letter R, third letter unknown, fourth letter unknown, fifth letter E.
- Uses only letters that haven't been ruled out. Ruled out: C, A, N, P, I, S.

We must avoid using these absent letters.

Now, consider available letters: The entire alphabet minus the absent ones.
Absent letters: C, A, N, P, I, S.
Available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a valid 5-letter word ending with ""_ R _ _ E""

Also, since E is at the end, we are looking for words like ?R??E.

Common words that fit this pattern and use available letters:

Possibilities:
- GRUEL? But U and E: E is at end? Pattern is _ R _ _ E -> GRUEL: G R U E L -> This would be positions: G1, R2, U3, E4, L5 -> but E4 is wrong? Fifth must be E? So GRUEL has L at fifth? Not matching.

The pattern requires fifth be E, so fourth letter must be something else? For example, the word must be of the form: ? R ? ? E

So the fourth letter is the letter before E? So the word has letters at pos: 1,2,3,4,5 -> 1=?, 2=R, 3=?, 4=?, 5=E

Therefore, we need words that end in R ? ? E? Actually, end with the fifth letter E? So it's ...E at the end.

Examples: 
- TROVE: T R O V E -> T? But check positions: T1, R2, O3, V4, E5. -> pattern fits.
- GROVE: G1 R2 O3 V4 E5 -> fits.
- PROVE? But P is absent -> invalid.
- BRUTE: B1 R2 U3 T4 E5 -> fits. We have U and T available.
- TRUCE? But C absent -> invalid.
- FRAME? A absent -> invalid.

From this, common words:
- GROVE
- TROVE
- BRUTE
- GRIME? But I is absent -> invalid.
- TRITE? T R I T E -> I absent -> invalid.
- TRUCE? C absent -> invalid.
- DRONE? D R O N E -> N absent -> invalid.
- BROME? B R O M E -> M available? But not sure about commonality.
- BROKE: B R O K E -> K available? Yes.

So possible: 
- GROVE (G,R,O,V,E)
- TROVE (T,R,O,V,E)
- BRUTE (B,R,U,T,E)
- BROKE (B,R,O,K,E)
- TRUER? T R U E R -> repeats E? But E is at position fifth? TRUER: T-R-U-E-R -> positions:1=T,2=R,3=U,4=E,5=R -> fourth letter E? But we need fourth to be unknown and fifth to be E? So TRUER ends with R? Not E? -> invalid.

Therefore, focus on words that end with E.

Another: DUCHY? Not matching pattern? D U C H Y -> no? Pattern must be ? R ? ? E.

DROVE: D R O V E -> D available? Yes.

So more: DROVE, GROVE, TROVE, BROKE, BRUTE, etc.

Now, for our next guess, we want to test new letters that are common and resolve possibilities.

We know the secret word must be one of these possibilities? But there might be many, so we need to narrow down.

Available letters: We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we need to use a word that fits the pattern and tests several of these.

For example, if we guess ""TROVE"":
- T, O, V are new.

""BRUTE"": tests B, U,T? But T is in both.

We might choose a word that avoids repeating letters? But repetition might be allowed? However, we haven't encountered any yet.

Prioritize high-frequency letters among the unknowns: O, T, L, D, U, M, etc.

The unknown positions are: first, third, and fourth.

Our next guess should cover as many as possible unused common letters in these positions.

Let me consider:

Option 1: ""GROVE"" -> tests G, O, V
Option 2: ""TROVE"" -> tests T, O, V
Option 3: ""BRUTE"" -> tests B, U, T

We also have ""DROVE"": tests D, O, V
""BROKE"": tests B, O, K

K is less common? O is a vowel and common.

Since we need to differentiate between the possibilities:

If we guess ""GROVE"", what does it tell?
- If G is correct, then it might be the word? Or if O or V are correct? We can get feedback per letter.

Similarly, ""TROVE"": T in position 1, O in position 3, V in position 4.

The position matters.

But we don't know which of these words it might be.

Another idea: choose a word that is different in structure? For example, include another vowel or consonant we suspect.

Also, note that the letter frequencies: O is a vowel that hasn't been tested? Previously we tested A in ""crane"" (absent) and I in ""prise"" (absent), so maybe an O might be present? Or U? Or others.

We have many candidates: GROVE, TROVE, DROVE, BROKE, BRUTE, etc.

We must pick one.

To test a wider range, perhaps choose a word that has letters not in the common options? But we don't know.

How about using L: are there common words? Like ""GRULE"" not a word. ""PRULE""? not. Or ""TROLE"" not word? So no.

M: ""GRUME"" is rare? Probably not. Better not.

So among the common: GROVE, TROVE, BRUTE, BROKE.

We'll pick ""GROVE"" as it is quite common and tests G, O, V? But then we don't test B or U? But we might test in next guesses.

Alternatively, let me see the letter frequency: Among unused letters, common ones: O, T, B, D, U, L, etc.

If we choose ""GROVE"", we test G (not very common but ok), O (common vowel), V (less common). Then we still have to test B, T, U, etc. later.

""BRUTE"" tests B, U, T -> B, U, T: U being vowel, B and T consonants -> might be better? Because T is very common.

Compare:
- ""BRUTE"": B first, U third, T fourth.
- ""TROVE"": T first, O third, V fourth.

If the word is ""BRUTE"" and we guess ""BRUTE"", we win? But also, if we guess something with more coverage.

But ""BRUTE"" lets us test T and B? But U is vowel.

Perhaps guess a word that doesn't necessarily fix the known pattern? But actually we can use a different pattern if we want? But we know the pattern must be _R__E? So no, because we know second is R and fifth is E? So the word must fit that.

We must guess a word that fits the pattern? Actually, not necessarily? When we guess, the feedback will tell us about the letters? So we can guess a word that breaks the pattern? Because if we guess, for example, a word without R in second or E in fifth? But then we know R and E will match? Because they are in the secret word? So if we don't put R second, then it might not be ✓? But we know it must be R✓, E✓, so we should use the pattern? Yes.

Therefore, we stick to the pattern.

I'll choose ""BRUTE"" because it tests B, U, T which includes T (very common) and U (vowel we haven't tested).

Also, B is common.

So guess ""BRUTE"".

But let's confirm: BRUTE is B-R-U-T-E -> positions: B1, R2, U3, T4, E5 -> pattern matches.

Absent letters avoided: no C,A,N,P,I,S.

So this is valid.

Therefore, next guess: bruteBased on the previous feedback:
- The secret word has the second letter as R and the fifth letter as E: pattern ""_ R _ _ E"".
- Absent letters to avoid: C, A, N, P, I, S.
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the new guess:
- Selected ""BRUTE"" (B-R-U-T-E) as it fits the pattern ""_ R _ _ E"" and tests new common letters:
  - B (position 1): High-frequency consonant.
  - U (position 3): Untested vowel.
  - T (position 4): High-frequency consonant.
- Avoids ruled-out letters while maximizing information gain on common vowels/consonants.

<guess>brute</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: prise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: brute -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
  - So R is in position 2, E is in position 5, and C, A, N are absent.

Guess 2: ""prise"" -> P(x), R(✓), I(x), S(x), E(✓)
  - R and E are confirmed again (same positions), and P, I, S are absent.

Guess 3: ""brute"" -> B(x), R(✓), U(x), T(x), E(✓)
  - R and E confirmed, and B, U, T are absent.

So now we know:
- The secret word is of the form: _ R _ _ E
- Absent letters: C, A, N, P, I, S, B, U, T
- Therefore, the available letters are: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ R _ _ E, using only the available letters.

Let's think of possible words:

- The first letter: must be one of D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- The third letter: same set
- The fourth letter: same set

Common words that come to mind:

- ""GROVE"": G R O V E -> but O and V are available? Let's check: O and V are in the available set. However, we haven't used O or V before, so it's possible. But we need to see if it fits the pattern: positions: 1=G, 2=R, 3=O, 4=V, 5=E -> matches.

- ""DROVE"": D R O V E -> D, O, V available? Yes.

- ""TROVE"": T is absent (from guess 3: T(x)), so TROVE is invalid.

- ""PROVE"": P is absent, invalid.

- ""GRACE"": A and C absent, invalid.

- ""FRAME"": A absent, invalid.

- ""WRITE"": I and T absent, invalid.

- ""DRONE"": N absent, invalid.

- ""CRONE"": C and N absent, invalid.

- ""PRONE"": P and N absent, invalid.

- ""BROKE"": B absent (from guess 3: B(x)), and K is available? But B is absent, so BROKE is invalid.

- ""BROME"": B absent and M available? But B is out.

- ""GROVE"" and ""DROVE"" are both possible.

- Also, ""GLOVE"": G L O V E -> L and O available? Yes. Pattern: 1=G, 2=R? No, ""GLOVE"" has L at position 2, not R. So it doesn't fit the pattern (we need R at position 2).

- ""GRAVE"": A absent, invalid.

- ""DROVE"" and ""GROVE"" are the main common ones.

- ""TROVE"" is invalid because T is absent.

- What about ""WROTE""? W R O T E -> but T is absent, so invalid.

- ""WROKE""? Not a common word.

- ""FROZE"": F R O Z E -> F, O, Z available? Z is available? Yes. But is ""FROZE"" a common word? Yes, meaning to freeze. Pattern: 1=F, 2=R, 3=O, 4=Z, 5=E -> matches.

- ""FROME""? Not a word.

- ""GROPE"": P absent, invalid.

- ""GRIME"": I absent, invalid.

- ""DRIVE"": I absent, invalid.

- ""DROOP"": doesn't end with E.

- ""DROLE""? Not common? Drole is not standard English; usually ""droll"" but that ends with L.

- ""DROME"": meaning a racing track? But ends with E? D R O M E -> positions: 1=D, 2=R, 3=O, 4=M, 5=E -> and M is available. So ""DROME"" is a word? Yes, as in aerodrome, but it can be used as a standalone word? It might be accepted.

- ""GROME""? Not a word.

- ""TRODE""? T absent, invalid.

- ""VROOM""? V R O O M -> ends with M, not E.

So the main candidates are:
- GROVE (G, O, V)
- DROVE (D, O, V)
- FROZE (F, O, Z)
- DROME (D, O, M)

We need to choose one to guess. Since we have limited guesses left, we want to pick one that might be the word or give us good information.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 out of 6).

We can try to guess one of these.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained by the pattern and available letters.

For example, if we guess ""GROVE"" and it's not the word, we get feedback on G, O, V.

Similarly for ""DROVE"".

But if we guess a word that has different letters, we might cover more.

However, we don't have many words to choose from.

Another candidate: ""GROPE"" but P is absent.

""GRACE"" but A and C absent.

""WRECK"" doesn't end with E? W R E C K -> no, and C and K? But pattern requires E at end.

""WROTE"" T absent.

""ROGUE"": R O G U E -> but R is at position 1? We need R at position 2. So ""ROGUE"" is R at 1, O at 2? No, pattern must be _ R _ _ E, so position 2 is R. ""ROGUE"" has R at 1, so it doesn't fit.

Similarly, ""ROUSE"" has R at 1 and S absent.

So no.

We might consider ""ORATE"": but A and T absent? A is absent, T is absent? So invalid.

So back to the list.

We can also consider ""GROWL"" doesn't end with E.

Therefore, the most common words are ""GROVE"" and ""DROVE"".

""FROZE"" is also common, especially in the context of freezing.

""DROME"" is less common.

We might prioritize ""GROVE"" or ""DROVE"".

But note: we haven't tested O or V? So if we guess ""GROVE"", we test G, O, V.

Similarly, ""DROVE"" tests D, O, V.

If we guess ""FROZE"", we test F, O, Z.

Since O is common, it might be in the word? But we don't know.

We can also think: if we guess ""GROVE"" and it's wrong, we know about G, O, V.

But we have to use one.

Another idea: what about ""ROWDY""? Doesn't end with E.

""ROWED"": R O W E D -> but pattern: 1=R? We need position 2 to be R? ""ROWED"" has R at 1, O at 2? So position 2 is O, not R? So it doesn't fit the pattern.

We must have position 2 as R.

So let's choose ""GROVE"" as it is a common word.

But we have ""DROVE"" as well.

To decide, note that in ""GROVE"" we test G, which we haven't tested, and in ""DROVE"" we test D, which we haven't tested.

D is more common than G? In English, D is more frequent than G.

But both are possible.

We can also consider the possibility of the word being ""FROZE"" or ""DROME"", but they are less common.

I think ""GROVE"" and ""DROVE"" are the top candidates.

Let me check the frequency: ""DROVE"" might be more common as the past tense of drive.

But ""GROVE"" is also common.

We'll go with ""DROVE"" because D is a very common starting letter.

So guess ""DROVE"".

But let's see: if we guess ""DROVE"", and it's not the word, we get feedback on D, O, V.

Then we can use that to distinguish.

Similarly, if we guess ""GROVE"", same thing.

But we have to pick one.

Another candidate: ""GROVE"" has G, which might be less common? But it's a word.

I think I'll choose ""GROVE"" to test G.

But let's see the available letters: we have many, but we need to cover.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn't use O? Because if O is not in the word, then we can eliminate it.

But we don't know.

For example, is there a word without O?

What about ""GRACE""? No, A and C absent.

""GREET"": E is at the end, but we have E at position 5, and we need to test the third and fourth. ""GREET"": G R E E T -> but T is absent, and also E at position 3? But we have E at position 5, but the word might have another E? However, in ""GREET"", position 3 is E, which we don't know about? But we haven't tested E in other positions? But in the first guess, E was at position 5 and correct, but it doesn't say if there are other E's.

In the feedback, for ""crane"", E was at position 5 and correct, but we don't know about other positions.

Similarly, in ""prise"" and ""brute"", E was at position 5 and correct.

But we never tested E in other positions? So it's possible that E appears elsewhere? But in the pattern, we have position 5 fixed as E, but other positions could be E? However, in the absent letters, we only know that C,A,N,P,I,S,B,U,T are absent, but E is present at least once.

But we don't know if there is a second E.

For example, the word could be ""GREET"", but T is absent, so invalid.

""CREME"": C absent, invalid.

""FREED"": F R E E D -> pattern: 1=F, 2=R, 3=E, 4=E, 5=D? But we need E at position 5? So no, because position 5 must be E? So ""FREED"" ends with D, not E.

""BREED"": B absent, and ends with D.

""GREEN"": G R E E N -> but N absent.

So no common words with E in position 3 or 4? Because position 5 is E, so if there is another E, it must be in position 3 or 4.

But with the absent letters, it's hard to find such a word.

For example, ""PREYE""? Not a word.

""TREED"": T absent, and ends with D.

So probably, the word does not have a second E? Or if it does, it's rare.

Therefore, we focus on words with O or other vowels.

Back to ""GROVE"", ""DROVE"", etc.

We also have ""WROTE"" but T absent.

""CRWTH""? Not ending with E.

I think we should go with ""GROVE"".

Or to test more letters, but we can't.

Another word: ""DROLE""? Not common, and L is available? But ""drole"" is not standard; usually ""droll"".

""ROULE""? Not a word.

So I think ""GROVE"" is a good guess.

But let's choose ""DROVE"" because D is more common.

I'll go with ""DROVE"".

So next guess: drove

But in the feedback, we have to see.

We are on guess 4.

So <guess>drove</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E (R in position 2, E in position 5).
- Absent letters: C, A, N, P, I, S, B, U, T (eliminated from guesses 1-3).
- Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the new guess, I selected ""DROVE"" (D-R-O-V-E) because:
- It fits the known pattern (_ R _ _ E) with D in position 1, O in position 3, and V in position 4.
- It tests three new common letters: D (high-frequency consonant), O (untested vowel), and V (consonant).
- It avoids all ruled-out letters and maximizes information gain by covering frequent unused letters.
- Common words like ""GROVE"" and ""DROVE"" are top candidates; ""DROVE"" was chosen as it tests D (more common than G in ""GROVE"") and helps differentiate between possibilities efficiently.

It might be.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""DRIVE"", which tests D, I, V.\n\n And ""D"" is a common consonant.\n\n Also, note that we are not guaranteed that I is in the word? So we are trying to guess and get feedback.\n\n We want to maximize information. Since the secret word might contain I or not.\n\n But we also haven\'t tested S, T, L, etc.\n\n Another idea: include more new letters? We have 6 guesses, so we can test.\n\n Alternatively, we might choose a word that doesn\'t put a vowel in third position? Because vowels are more variable.\n\n Let me consider ""TRADE"": not allowed because A is absent -> invalid.\n\n ""PRUDE"": P R U D E -> pattern? P first, R second, U third, D fourth, E fifth -> and U is a vowel we haven\'t tested.\n\n We haven\'t tested U? Then we can test U? But frequency might be lower.\n\n Another: ""GRIPE"": G R I P E -> tests G, I, P.\n\n We could also choose ""PRIDE"": P R I D E -> tests P, I, D.\n\n Among these, ""PRIDE"" seems common.\n\n But let me think: since we have two unknown positions: first and third as well as fourth? Wait:\n\n Pattern: [1] R [3] [4] E\n\n We have three unknowns: positions 1,3,4.\n\n In ""PRIDE"": 1=P, 3=I, 4=D -> so tests P,I,D.\n\n Alternatively, ""TRIPE"": T R I P E -> tests T,I,P.\n\n We can also test S?

But S in which position?\n\n Pattern: [1]R[3][4]E -> we can put S in position 1? -> ""sprite"" has S but five letters? ""SpritE"" would be S P R I T E -> that\'s six letters? Wait, no: we need 5-letter words.\n\n Five-letter words fitting this pattern and without C,A,N:\n\n Let me list some: \n   bride, bribe? (bribe: B R I B E -> has repeated B? and E at end -> acceptable? We need to see if repetition is allowed. The game rules didn\'t say anything, so yes.)\n   drive: D R I V E\n   grime: G R I M E\n   gripe: G R I P E\n   prise: P R I S E? Prise: common? Yes, meaning to lever open? But also might be a variant of prize. But let\'s see.\n   price: not allowed (C)\n   prime: P R I M E -> M tested\n   trice: not allowed (C)\n   tribe: T R I B E -> B tested\n   tripe: T R I P E\n   write: W R I T E -> W is not very common.\n\n I think ""PRIDE"" is a good candidate.\n\n But note: we got E correct at fifth, and R correct at second. In ""PRIDE"", the fourth letter is D? That might be tested.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s choose a word that uses a different vowel if available? We haven\'t tested I, O, U.\n\n Since I is common, testing I is good.\n\n We\'ll go with ""PRIDE"": because it tests P (common consonant), I (vowel), and D (common consonant).\n\n So next guess: pride\n\n But wait, I changed my mind. Why not test S? Because S is very common.\n\n Possible: ""prise"" -> P R I S E -> same as pride but with S? But ""prise"" is a word meaning to force open? Yes.\n\n However, note that ""pride"" and ""prise"" both have P and I? But ""pride"" has D, ""prise"" has S.\n\n For information, S might be better.\n\n Word ""PRISE"" uses S at position 4? Pattern: P at1, R2, I3, S4, E5 -> so tests P, I, S.\n\n Compare ""PRIDE"" (tests P,I,D) vs ""PRISE"" (tests P,I,S). S is more frequent than D in English? Yes, S is very common.\n\n So ""PRISE"" might be better.\n\n But also: what if we don\'t use I? For example, we could choose ""PROSE"": P R O S E -> tests O (vowel) and S. But O is a vowel we haven\'t tested.\n\n However, we don\'t know if O is present? So testing a new vowel O might be equivalent to testing I? But I is slightly more common.\n\n Since we tested E already, and E is present, O or I are equally likely? Not necessarily, but we don\'t know.\n\n To maximize consonant tests, we note that S is more useful.\n\n So ""PRISE"" might be a better guess? But also, note that ""PRISE"" uses the same positions: P at1, R2, I3, S4, E5.\n\n We\'ll go with ""PRISE"" because S is a high-frequency letter.\n\n But wait: the word must be valid. Is ""PRISE"" accepted? It is a valid word.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROUSE""? But R is second, so first must be ? R at second? ""ROUSE"" has R first? -> no, R is at position first? So not matching pattern.\n\n Pattern must be _ R _ _ E -> so first letter is unknown, second is R, then two letters, then E. So ""r? ? e"" but with R at second? So ""?? E"" pattern is fixed: position1: ?, position2: R, position3: ?, position4: ?, position5: E.\n\n Therefore, in ""PRISE"", we get: position1=P, position2=R, position3=I, position4=S, position5=E -> matches.\n\n So ""PRISE"" is a valid guess.\n\n Also, note: we haven\'t tested T? How about ""TRUSS""? T R U S S -> pattern: T1, R2, U3, S4, S5? But fifth must be E -> fixed.\n\n So we cannot break the E at fifth.\n\n Therefore, we stick to words ending with E.\n\n We choose ""PRISE"" to test P, I, S.\n\n Another candidate: ""BRISE""? Meaning: brise? Not common. Better stick to common words.\n\n Let me confirm: PRISE is valid.\n\n So we\'ll guess ""prise"".\n\n But note: ""PRIDE"" is also common, but ""PRISE"" uses S which has higher frequency? And S might be more beneficial.\n\n Alternatively, ""GRISE"" meaning to shudder? Rare? So not good.\n\n So I think ""PRISE"" is acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, ""TRICE"" is not allowed due to C.\n\n Therefore, ""PRISE"" it is.\n\n But wait, what about ""DRIVE""? D, R, I, V, E -> D at first, R second, I third, V fourth, E fifth -> fits. Then we test D, I, V? We haven\'t tested V? V is less common than S.\n\n Since S is more frequent, we prefer S.\n\n We\'ll go with ""PRISE"".\n\n But another idea: we could try ""BRUTE"" but at fifth? Pattern: _ R _ _ E -> BRUTE: B at first, R at second, U at third, T at fourth, E at fifth. Tests B,U,T -> T common, U vowel? Not bad. But then we skip I?\n\n Since we are trying to test letters, we have to pick one.\n\n I think I\'ll stick with ""PRISE"" because it includes S, the most common consonant we haven\'t tested.\n\n Therefore, next guess: ""prise""\n\n However, before we decide: we know the word has R and E (specifically, second letter R and fifth letter E). And we know C,A,N are out.\n\n Letter E: we haven\'t tested E in other positions? But the word might have E only at the fifth? Or it might have more? But we don\'t know.\n\n But in ""PRISE"", E is at fifth only? Actually, the word ends with E.\n\n So let\'s commit: ""prise""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- R is correct and in position 2.\n- E is correct and in position 5.\n- C, A, and N are absent.\n\nThe secret word must have the form: _ R _ _ E.\n\nFor the next guess, I chose a word that fits this pattern, avoids C/A/N, tests new common letters (P, I, S), and maximizes information gain. ""Prise"" (meaning to force open or lever) was selected because:\n- It tests P in position 1 and S in position 4, both high-frequency consonants.\n- It tests I (a vowel) in position 3.\n- It avoids previously absent letters (C/A/N) and reuses known correct E in position 5.\n\nThis guess helps cover frequent unused letters while leveraging the fixed R and E positions.\n\n<guess>prise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: prise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nMeaning:\n- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).\n- C, A, N are not in the word.\n\nThus, the secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E\n\nGuess 2: prise -> Feedback: P(x) R(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\nMeaning:\n- R (position 2) and E (position 5) are still correct, which we knew.\n- P, I, S are not in the word.\n\nSo now we know the secret word does NOT contain: C, A, N, P, I, S\nAnd it must have the pattern: _ R _ _ E\n\nSince all other letters in the two guesses are now marked absent, we have more constraints.\n\nWe need to choose a new word that:\n- Fits the pattern: first letter unknown, second letter R, third letter unknown, fourth letter unknown, fifth letter E.\n- Uses only letters that haven\'t been ruled out. Ruled out: C, A, N, P, I, S.\n\nWe must avoid using these absent letters.\n\nNow, consider available letters: The entire alphabet minus the absent ones.\nAbsent letters: C, A, N, P, I, S.\nAvailable: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe need to form a valid 5-letter word ending with ""_ R _ _ E""\n\nAlso, since E is at the end, we are looking for words like ?R??E.\n\nCommon words that fit this pattern and use available letters:\n\nPossibilities:\n- GRUEL? But U and E: E is at end? Pattern is _ R _ _ E -> GRUEL: G R U E L -> This would be positions: G1, R2, U3, E4, L5 -> but E4 is wrong? Fifth must be E? So GRUEL has L at fifth? Not matching.\n\nThe pattern requires fifth be E, so fourth letter must be something else? For example, the word must be of the form: ? R ? ? E\n\nSo the fourth letter is the letter before E? So the word has letters at pos: 1,2,3,4,5 -> 1=?, 2=R, 3=?, 4=?, 5=E\n\nTherefore, we need words that end in R ? ? E? Actually, end with the fifth letter E? So it\'s ...E at the end.\n\nExamples: \n- TROVE: T R O V E -> T? But check positions: T1, R2, O3, V4, E5. -> pattern fits.\n- GROVE: G1 R2 O3 V4 E5 -> fits.\n- PROVE? But P is absent -> invalid.\n- BRUTE: B1 R2 U3 T4 E5 -> fits. We have U and T available.\n- TRUCE? But C absent -> invalid.\n- FRAME? A absent -> invalid.\n\nFrom this, common words:\n- GROVE\n- TROVE\n- BRUTE\n- GRIME? But I is absent -> invalid.\n- TRITE? T R I T E -> I absent -> invalid.\n- TRUCE? C absent -> invalid.\n- DRONE? D R O N E -> N absent -> invalid.\n- BROME? B R O M E -> M available? But not sure about commonality.\n- BROKE: B R O K E -> K available? Yes.\n\nSo possible: \n- GROVE (G,R,O,V,E)\n- TROVE (T,R,O,V,E)\n- BRUTE (B,R,U,T,E)\n- BROKE (B,R,O,K,E)\n- TRUER? T R U E R -> repeats E? But E is at position fifth? TRUER: T-R-U-E-R -> positions:1=T,2=R,3=U,4=E,5=R -> fourth letter E? But we need fourth to be unknown and fifth to be E? So TRUER ends with R? Not E? -> invalid.\n\nTherefore, focus on words that end with E.\n\nAnother: DUCHY? Not matching pattern? D U C H Y -> no? Pattern must be ? R ? ? E.\n\nDROVE: D R O V E -> D available? Yes.\n\nSo more: DROVE, GROVE, TROVE, BROKE, BRUTE, etc.\n\nNow, for our next guess, we want to test new letters that are common and resolve possibilities.\n\nWe know the secret word must be one of these possibilities? But there might be many, so we need to narrow down.\n\nAvailable letters: We haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut we need to use a word that fits the pattern and tests several of these.\n\nFor example, if we guess ""TROVE"":\n- T, O, V are new.\n\n""BRUTE"": tests B, U,T? But T is in both.\n\nWe might choose a word that avoids repeating letters? But repetition might be allowed? However, we haven\'t encountered any yet.\n\nPrioritize high-frequency letters among the unknowns: O, T, L, D, U, M, etc.\n\nThe unknown positions are: first, third, and fourth.\n\nOur next guess should cover as many as possible unused common letters in these positions.\n\nLet me consider:\n\nOption 1: ""GROVE"" -> tests G, O, V\nOption 2: ""TROVE"" -> tests T, O, V\nOption 3: ""BRUTE"" -> tests B, U, T\n\nWe also have ""DROVE"": tests D, O, V\n""BROKE"": tests B, O, K\n\nK is less common? O is a vowel and common.\n\nSince we need to differentiate between the possibilities:\n\nIf we guess ""GROVE"", what does it tell?\n- If G is correct, then it might be the word? Or if O or V are correct? We can get feedback per letter.\n\nSimilarly, ""TROVE"": T in position 1, O in position 3, V in position 4.\n\nThe position matters.\n\nBut we don\'t know which of these words it might be.\n\nAnother idea: choose a word that is different in structure? For example, include another vowel or consonant we suspect.\n\nAlso, note that the letter frequencies: O is a vowel that hasn\'t been tested? Previously we tested A in ""crane"" (absent) and I in ""prise"" (absent), so maybe an O might be present? Or U? Or others.\n\nWe have many candidates: GROVE, TROVE, DROVE, BROKE, BRUTE, etc.\n\nWe must pick one.\n\nTo test a wider range, perhaps choose a word that has letters not in the common options? But we don\'t know.\n\nHow about using L: are there common words? Like ""GRULE"" not a word. ""PRULE""? not. Or ""TROLE"" not word? So no.\n\nM: ""GRUME"" is rare? Probably not. Better not.\n\nSo among the common: GROVE, TROVE, BRUTE, BROKE.\n\nWe\'ll pick ""GROVE"" as it is quite common and tests G, O, V? But then we don\'t test B or U? But we might test in next guesses.\n\nAlternatively, let me see the letter frequency: Among unused letters, common ones: O, T, B, D, U, L, etc.\n\nIf we choose ""GROVE"", we test G (not very common but ok), O (common vowel), V (less common). Then we still have to test B, T, U, etc. later.\n\n""BRUTE"" tests B, U, T -> B, U, T: U being vowel, B and T consonants -> might be better? Because T is very common.\n\nCompare:\n- ""BRUTE"": B first, U third, T fourth.\n- ""TROVE"": T first, O third, V fourth.\n\nIf the word is ""BRUTE"" and we guess ""BRUTE"", we win? But also, if we guess something with more coverage.\n\nBut ""BRUTE"" lets us test T and B? But U is vowel.\n\nPerhaps guess a word that doesn\'t necessarily fix the known pattern? But actually we can use a different pattern if we want? But we know the pattern must be _R__E? So no, because we know second is R and fifth is E? So the word must fit that.\n\nWe must guess a word that fits the pattern? Actually, not necessarily? When we guess, the feedback will tell us about the letters? So we can guess a word that breaks the pattern? Because if we guess, for example, a word without R in second or E in fifth? But then we know R and E will match? Because they are in the secret word? So if we don\'t put R second, then it might not be ✓? But we know it must be R✓, E✓, so we should use the pattern? Yes.\n\nTherefore, we stick to the pattern.\n\nI\'ll choose ""BRUTE"" because it tests B, U, T which includes T (very common) and U (vowel we haven\'t tested).\n\nAlso, B is common.\n\nSo guess ""BRUTE"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: BRUTE is B-R-U-T-E -> positions: B1, R2, U3, T4, E5 -> pattern matches.\n\nAbsent letters avoided: no C,A,N,P,I,S.\n\nSo this is valid.\n\nTherefore, next guess: bruteBased on the previous feedback:\n- The secret word has the second letter as R and the fifth letter as E: pattern ""_ R _ _ E"".\n- Absent letters to avoid: C, A, N, P, I, S.\n- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nFor the new guess:\n- Selected ""BRUTE"" (B-R-U-T-E) as it fits the pattern ""_ R _ _ E"" and tests new common letters:\n  - B (position 1): High-frequency consonant.\n  - U (position 3): Untested vowel.\n  - T (position 4): High-frequency consonant.\n- Avoids ruled-out letters while maximizing information gain on common vowels/consonants.\n\n<guess>brute</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: prise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: brute -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) U(x) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(✓)\n  - So R is in position 2, E is in position 5, and C, A, N are absent.\n\nGuess 2: ""prise"" -> P(x), R(✓), I(x), S(x), E(✓)\n  - R and E are confirmed again (same positions), and P, I, S are absent.\n\nGuess 3: ""brute"" -> B(x), R(✓), U(x), T(x), E(✓)\n  - R and E confirmed, and B, U, T are absent.\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word is of the form: _ R _ _ E\n- Absent letters: C, A, N, P, I, S, B, U, T\n- Therefore, the available letters are: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ R _ _ E, using only the available letters.\n\nLet\'s think of possible words:\n\n- The first letter: must be one of D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z\n- The third letter: same set\n- The fourth letter: same set\n\nCommon words that come to mind:\n\n- ""GROVE"": G R O V E -> but O and V are available?

Yes, meaning to freeze. Pattern: 1=F, 2=R, 3=O, 4=Z, 5=E -> matches.\n\n- ""FROME""? Not a word.\n\n- ""GROPE"": P absent, invalid.\n\n- ""GRIME"": I absent, invalid.\n\n- ""DRIVE"": I absent, invalid.\n\n- ""DROOP"": doesn\'t end with E.\n\n- ""DROLE""? Not common? Drole is not standard English; usually ""droll"" but that ends with L.\n\n- ""DROME"": meaning a racing track? But ends with E? D R O M E -> positions: 1=D, 2=R, 3=O, 4=M, 5=E -> and M is available.

Since we have limited guesses left, we want to pick one that might be the word or give us good information.\n\nBut note: we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 out of 6).\n\nWe can try to guess one of these.\n\nAlternatively, we might choose a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained by the pattern and available letters.\n\nFor example, if we guess ""GROVE"" and it\'s not the word, we get feedback on G, O, V.\n\nSimilarly for ""DROVE"".\n\nBut if we guess a word that has different letters, we might cover more.\n\nHowever, we don\'t have many words to choose from.\n\nAnother candidate: ""GROPE"" but P is absent.\n\n""GRACE"" but A and C absent.\n\n""WRECK"" doesn\'t end with E? W R E C K -> no, and C and K? But pattern requires E at end.\n\n""WROTE"" T absent.\n\n""ROGUE"": R O G U E -> but R is at position 1? We need R at position 2. So ""ROGUE"" is R at 1, O at 2? No, pattern must be _ R _ _ E, so position 2 is R. ""ROGUE"" has R at 1, so it doesn\'t fit.\n\nSimilarly, ""ROUSE"" has R at 1 and S absent.\n\nSo no.\n\nWe might consider ""ORATE"": but A and T absent? A is absent, T is absent? So invalid.\n\nSo back to the list.\n\nWe can also consider ""GROWL"" doesn\'t end with E.\n\nTherefore, the most common words are ""GROVE"" and ""DROVE"".\n\n""FROZE"" is also common, especially in the context of freezing.\n\n""DROME"" is less common.\n\nWe might prioritize ""GROVE"" or ""DROVE"".\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested O or V? So if we guess ""GROVE"", we test G, O, V.\n\nSimilarly, ""DROVE"" tests D, O, V.\n\nIf we guess ""FROZE"", we test F, O, Z.\n\nSince O is common, it might be in the word? But we don\'t know.\n\nWe can also think: if we guess ""GROVE"" and it\'s wrong, we know about G, O, V.\n\nBut we have to use one.\n\nAnother idea: what about ""ROWDY""? Doesn\'t end with E.\n\n""ROWED"": R O W E D -> but pattern: 1=R? We need position 2 to be R? ""ROWED"" has R at 1, O at 2? So position 2 is O, not R? So it doesn\'t fit the pattern.\n\nWe must have position 2 as R.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""GROVE"" as it is a common word.\n\nBut we have ""DROVE"" as well.\n\nTo decide, note that in ""GROVE"" we test G, which we haven\'t tested, and in ""DROVE"" we test D, which we haven\'t tested.\n\nD is more common than G? In English, D is more frequent than G.\n\nBut both are possible.\n\nWe can also consider the possibility of the word being ""FROZE"" or ""DROME"", but they are less common.\n\nI think ""GROVE"" and ""DROVE"" are the top candidates.\n\nLet me check the frequency: ""DROVE"" might be more common as the past tense of drive.\n\nBut ""GROVE"" is also common.\n\nWe\'ll go with ""DROVE"" because D is a very common starting letter.\n\nSo guess ""DROVE"".\n\nBut let\'s see: if we guess ""DROVE"", and it\'s not the word, we get feedback on D, O, V.\n\nThen we can use that to distinguish.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""GROVE"", same thing.\n\nBut we have to pick one.\n\nAnother candidate: ""GROVE"" has G, which might be less common? But it\'s a word.\n\nI think I\'ll choose ""GROVE"" to test G.\n\nBut let\'s see the available letters: we have many, but we need to cover.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that doesn\'t use O? Because if O is not in the word, then we can eliminate it.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nFor example, is there a word without O?\n\nWhat about ""GRACE""? No, A and C absent.\n\n""GREET"": E is at the end, but we have E at position 5, and we need to test the third and fourth. ""GREET"": G R E E T -> but T is absent, and also E at position 3? But we have E at position 5, but the word might have another E? However, in ""GREET"", position 3 is E, which we don\'t know about? But we haven\'t tested E in other positions? But in the first guess, E was at position 5 and correct, but it doesn\'t say if there are other E\'s.\n\nIn the feedback, for ""crane"", E was at position 5 and correct, but we don\'t know about other positions.\n\nSimilarly, in ""prise"" and ""brute"", E was at position 5 and correct.\n\nBut we never tested E in other positions? So it\'s possible that E appears elsewhere? But in the pattern, we have position 5 fixed as E, but other positions could be E? However, in the absent letters, we only know that C,A,N,P,I,S,B,U,T are absent, but E is present at least once.\n\nBut we don\'t know if there is a second E.\n\nFor example, the word could be ""GREET"", but T is absent, so invalid.\n\n""CREME"": C absent, invalid.\n\n""FREED"": F R E E D -> pattern: 1=F, 2=R, 3=E, 4=E, 5=D? But we need E at position 5? So no, because position 5 must be E? So ""FREED"" ends with D, not E.\n\n""BREED"": B absent, and ends with D.\n\n""GREEN"": G R E E N -> but N absent.\n\nSo no common words with E in position 3 or 4? Because position 5 is E, so if there is another E, it must be in position 3 or 4.\n\nBut with the absent letters, it\'s hard to find such a word.\n\nFor example, ""PREYE""? Not a word.\n\n""TREED"": T absent, and ends with D.\n\nSo probably, the word does not have a second E? Or if it does, it\'s rare.\n\nTherefore, we focus on words with O or other vowels.\n\nBack to ""GROVE"", ""DROVE"", etc.\n\nWe also have ""WROTE"" but T absent.\n\n""CRWTH""? Not ending with E.\n\nI think we should go with ""GROVE"".\n\nOr to test more letters, but we can\'t.\n\nAnother word: ""DROLE""? Not common, and L is available? But ""drole"" is not standard; usually ""droll"".\n\n""ROULE""? Not a word.\n\nSo I think ""GROVE"" is a good guess.\n\nBut let\'s choose ""DROVE"" because D is more common.\n\nI\'ll go with ""DROVE"".\n\nSo next guess: drove\n\nBut in the feedback, we have to see.\n\nWe are on guess 4.\n\nSo <guess>drove</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E (R in position 2, E in position 5).\n- Absent letters: C, A, N, P, I, S, B, U, T (eliminated from guesses 1-3).\n- Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nFor the new guess, I selected ""DROVE"" (D-R-O-V-E) because:\n- It fits the known pattern (_ R _ _ E) with D in position 1, O in position 3, and V in position 4.\n- It tests three new common letters: D (high-frequency consonant), O (untested vowel), and V (consonant).\n- It avoids all ruled-out letters and maximizes information gain by covering frequent unused letters.\n- Common words like ""GROVE"" and ""DROVE"" are top candidates; ""DROVE"" was chosen as it tests D (more common than G in ""GROVE"") and helps differentiate between possibilities efficiently.\n\n<guess>drove</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: prise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: brute -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) U(x) T(x) E(✓)\nGuess 4: drove -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" 
- C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
→ R is correct and in position 2, E is correct and in position 5. C, A, N absent.

Guess 2: ""prise""
- P(x), R(✓), I(x), S(x), E(✓)
→ R(✓) and E(✓) confirmed. P, I, S absent.

Guess 3: ""brute""
- B(x), R(✓), U(x), T(x), E(✓)
→ R(✓) and E(✓) confirmed. B, U, T absent.

Guess 4: ""drove""
- D(x), R(✓), O(✓), V(x), E(✓)
→ R(✓) position 2, O(✓) position 3, E(✓) position 5. D and V absent.

Now the feedback says O(✓) and it's in position 3. So O is correct and in position 3.

Summary:
- Known positions:
  - Position 2: R
  - Position 3: O (new from guess 4)
  - Position 5: E
- Absent letters: C, A, N, P, I, S, B, U, T, D, V
- Therefore, available letters: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, W, X, Y, Z (but must form a word)

The pattern now is: _ R O _ E

Also, we know the first letter is one of F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, W, X, Y, Z and the fourth letter is from the same set.

We need to find valid English words matching the pattern ""? R O ? E"".

Let's think of possible words:

- ""GROVE"": G R O V E -> but V is absent (from guess 4: V(x)), so invalid.
- ""FROZE"": F R O Z E -> Z is available? Yes, and F is available? Yes. Pattern: 1=F, 2=R, 3=O, 4=Z, 5=E -> matches? But we need the fourth letter? It's Z? Then yes.
- ""WROTE"": W R O T E -> T is absent (from guess 3), so invalid.
- ""PROVE"": P absent, invalid.
- ""BROKE"": B absent, invalid.
- ""TRONE"": T absent, invalid.
- ""CROME"": C absent, invalid.
- ""FRORE"": meaning frosty? F R O R E -> but has R at position 4? Pattern requires fourth letter unknown? ""FRORE"": spelling is F-R-O-R-E? So positions: 1=F, 2=R, 3=O, 4=R, 5=E -> and R is repeated? Is that allowed? The game allows repeated letters? Rules didn't forbid it. But we haven't seen any in feedback. However, R is at position 4? But we already have R at position 2? So it's possible.

But ""FRORE"" is not commonly used? Might be archaic.

- ""GRONE""? Not a word.
- ""PRONE"": P absent.
- ""DROME"": D absent (from guess 4), and D is absent? So invalid.
- ""ELOPE""? Pattern doesn't start with E? Pattern must be ? R O ? E, so first letter is unknown, second R, third O, so ""ELOPE"" has E at first? But E is already at fifth? And positions: E1, L? not R, so no.
- ""EROSE"": E R O S E -> S absent? S is absent from guess 2. Also, position: E1, R2, O3, S4? But S is absent, invalid.

Common words:
- ""FROZE"": F R O Z E -> checks out? F, Z available.
- ""FROME""? Not a word.
- ""CROWD"": Doesn't end with E.
- ""CROCE"": C absent.
- ""GLOVE"": G L O V E -> but V absent and also pattern: position 2 would be L? Not R, so no.

Other possibilities: 
- ""WROKE""? Not common.
- ""PROLE"": P absent.
- ""TROKE"": T absent.

But ""FROZE"" seems valid. Also ""FRORE"" or ""FROGE""? Not word.

Another: ""FROWN"" doesn't end with E.

So ""FROZE"" is the most common option?

But let me think: are there other words?

What about ""GROVE"" V absent? No.

""GROVEL"" is 6 letters.

""MROME""? Not a word.

""KROME""? K R O M E -> M available? Yes. But is ""KROME"" a word? Not common; proper noun perhaps? But not standard.

""PROSE"": P and S absent.

Also, note: we have few guesses left (2 after this one).

So we need to consider:

Since O is confirmed at position 3, and pattern is ? R O ? E, the fourth letter must be one of F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,W,X,Y,Z? But from available letters.

The word ""FROZE"" uses F and Z. Z is less common? So perhaps it is the word?

But ""GROVE"" was invalid because V is out.

What about ""GROPE""? P absent.

Perhaps ""HORDE"": H O R D E -> but pattern requires position 2: R, position 3: O? ""HORDE"": H1, O2, R3, D4, E5. So position 2 is O, not R? Doesn't fit the pattern.

Similarly, ""MORSE"": M O R S E -> O at 2? Not R.

So the word must have position 2: R, position 3: O.

Therefore, possible words are limited.

Another: ""CROME"" but C absent.

""TRONE"" T absent.

""WRECK"": ends with K? Not E.

""WROTE"" T absent.

Therefore, ""FROZE"" might be the only common one? Or ""FRORE""?

But ""FRORE"" is rare, while ""FROZE"" is the past tense of ""freeze"" in archaic usage? Or a variant of frozen? Not standard.

Actually, ""FROZE"" is an alternative spelling of ""froze"", past tense of freeze? Freeze, froze, frozen? Correct: freeze - froze - frozen? So ""froze"" is common.

But ""FROZE"" as a word: yes, meaning cold? But in Wordle, it's accepted? Probably yes.

Also, spelling: F-R-O-Z-E, which fits ? R O ? E with fourth as Z.

So let's go with ""FROZE"".

Another possibility: ""GROVE"" not available? Oh wait, we have V absent.

What about ""GLOBE""? But pattern: G L O B E -> position 2 is L? Not R, so no.

So I think ""FROZE"" is the best guess.

Therefore, next guess: froze

But we must avoid previous absent letters: no D,V,T,B,U, etc. F and Z are available.

So yes.

After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Pattern Constraint**: The secret word must match the pattern ""_ R O _ E"" (R in position 2, O in position 3, E in position 5).
- **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, P, I, S, B, U, T, D, and V are absent (eliminated from guesses 1–4).
- **Available Letters**: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, W, X, Y, Z must be used for the missing letters (positions 1 and 4).
- **Possible Words**: Common English words fitting the pattern ""_RO_E"" include ""FROZE"" (archaic for ""frozen""), ""GROVE"" (eliminated because V is absent), ""FROME"" (invalid), and rare options like ""FRORE"" or ""KROME"". ""FROZE"" is the most viable common word.
- **Chosen Guess**: ""FROZE"" tests F (position 1) and Z (position 4), both high-frequency consonants from the available letters. It maximizes information gain by covering untested letters while adhering to the pattern.

<guess>froze</guess>",froze,"We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" 
- C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
→ R is correct and in position 2, E is correct and in position 5. C, A, N absent.

Guess 2: ""prise""
- P(x), R(✓), I(x), S(x), E(✓)
→ R(✓) and E(✓) confirmed. P, I, S absent.

Guess 3: ""brute""
- B(x), R(✓), U(x), T(x), E(✓)
→ R(✓) and E(✓) confirmed. B, U, T absent.

Guess 4: ""drove""
- D(x), R(✓), O(✓), V(x), E(✓)
→ R(✓) position 2, O(✓) position 3, E(✓) position 5. D and V absent.

Now the feedback says O(✓) and it's in position 3. So O is correct and in position 3.

Summary:
- Known positions:
  - Position 2: R
  - Position 3: O (new from guess 4)
  - Position 5: E
- Absent letters: C, A, N, P, I, S, B, U, T, D, V
- Therefore, available letters: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, W, X, Y, Z (but must form a word)

The pattern now is: _ R O _ E

Also, we know the first letter is one of F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, W, X, Y, Z and the fourth letter is from the same set.

We need to find valid English words matching the pattern ""? R O ? E"".

Let's think of possible words:

- ""GROVE"": G R O V E -> but V is absent (from guess 4: V(x)), so invalid.
- ""FROZE"": F R O Z E -> Z is available? Yes, and F is available? Yes. Pattern: 1=F, 2=R, 3=O, 4=Z, 5=E -> matches? But we need the fourth letter? It's Z? Then yes.
- ""WROTE"": W R O T E -> T is absent (from guess 3), so invalid.
- ""PROVE"": P absent, invalid.
- ""BROKE"": B absent, invalid.
- ""TRONE"": T absent, invalid.
- ""CROME"": C absent, invalid.
- ""FRORE"": meaning frosty? F R O R E -> but has R at position 4? Pattern requires fourth letter unknown? ""FRORE"": spelling is F-R-O-R-E?
