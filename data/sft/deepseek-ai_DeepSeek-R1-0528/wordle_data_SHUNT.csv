We are starting the game. Since we don't have any information yet, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have a combination of common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.

 Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels and frequent consonants. Some research suggests words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", etc.
 But note: the example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"". We'll choose a word that has five distinct letters and common ones.

 Let me choose a word: ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. These are fairly common.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a popular starter.

 However, to stick with a common starter, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 So my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

 We'll then get feedback and use that in the next step.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so the 4th letter is N)
- E: x (not in the word)

So we know:
- The 4th letter is N.
- The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.
- Therefore, the word has N in the 4th position and does not contain C, R, A, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has N in the 4th position (to confirm or get more information, but we already know that, so we can use it to test other letters).
- Avoids the letters C, R, A, E.
- Includes other common letters to maximize information.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We can try a word that has N in the 4th position and uses other common letters.

Possible words: 
- We know the word is 5 letters, 4th is N.

Let's think of words ending with N? Actually, the 4th letter is the fourth position, so the word is _ _ _ N _

We need to avoid C, R, A, E.

Let me list some words that fit:
- ""BLIND"": B, L, I, N, D -> but we don't know if B, L, I, D are in the word. However, we haven't tested these letters.
- ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> also avoids the forbidden letters.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since we know the 4th letter is N, we can try to use a word that has N in the 4th position and includes other common letters that we haven't tested.

Let me choose a word that has distinct letters and common ones: for example, ""POINT"" (P, O, I, N, T) or ""JOINT"" (J is less common) or ""MOUNT"" (M, O, U, N, T) but U is a vowel that might be less common.

Alternatively, ""SLING"": S, L, I, N, G -> but the 4th letter is N? Wait, SLING: positions: 1-S, 2-L, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G -> yes.

But we have to avoid E, A, R, C. ""SLING"" doesn't have any of these.

Another common word: ""STING"": S, T, I, N, G -> same as above but with T instead of L.

We might also consider ""POINT"" because it has P, O, I, T which are common.

But note: we don't know if the word has any of these. We are trying to cover more ground.

I think ""POINT"" is a good candidate because it uses P, O, I, T and N in the 4th position.

Alternatively, ""JOINT"" is similar but J is less common. So ""POINT"" is better.

Another option: ""BLUNT"" -> B, L, U, N, T. But U is a vowel that might be less common.

I think ""POINT"" is a solid choice.

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""POINT"" is a valid word.

So I'll go with ""POINT"".

We'll then get feedback on which letters are in the word and in which positions.

Let me write the guess: POINT

But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that the 4th letter is N, so in ""POINT"", the 4th letter is N, which is correct. We are hoping to get information about the other positions.

So the next guess is ""POINT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are not in the word (marked with ""x"").
- N is in the correct 4th position (marked with ""✓"").

This means:
- The secret word has the form: `_ _ _ N _`.
- The word does not contain C, R, A, or E.
- We should avoid these letters in the next guess and focus on testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, P, D, M) to maximize information.

For the second guess, I chose **""point""** because:
- It includes N in the 4th position (to maintain that known correct letter).
- It tests new common letters: P, O, I, and T (all high-frequency and not yet tried).
- It avoids the excluded letters (C, R, A, E).
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess will help identify if any of P, O, I, or T are in the word and their positions.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct, in position 4)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""point""
- P: x (not in the word)
- O: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct, in position 4)
- T: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

So, from the feedback:
- The word has N in the 4th position and T in the 5th position. So the word ends with ""NT"".
- The letters C, R, A, E, P, O, I are all not in the word.

Therefore, the word is of the form: _ _ _ N T

We know the word has 5 letters: positions 1, 2, 3 are unknown, position 4 is N, position 5 is T.

We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, E, P, O, I.

We need to choose a word that:
- Has the 4th letter as N and 5th as T.
- Avoids the letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, I.
- Tests new common letters for positions 1, 2, and 3.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, L, U, D, M, B, G, K, W, V, Y, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible in the first three positions.

Possible words ending with ""NT"": 

We can think of words like:
- SAINT (but A is excluded, so invalid)
- JOINT (but O and I are excluded)
- MOUNT (but O is excluded)
- COUNT (O is excluded)
- HUNT (only 4 letters, too short)
- BUNT (but U and B are not tried, but let's see)

We need 5-letter words.

List of 5-letter words ending with ""NT"" that avoid C, R, A, E, P, O, I:

Possible candidates:
- BLUNT: B, L, U, N, T -> avoids the excluded letters? 
  Excluded: C, R, A, E, P, O, I. So B, L, U are new and allowed.
- GRUNT: G, R, U, N, T -> but R is excluded (from guess1: R(x)), so invalid.
- STUNT: S, T, U, N, T -> T is already known to be in position 5, but we can have T elsewhere? The feedback for T in ""point"" was in position 5, but it might be elsewhere? Actually, the feedback for ""point"" shows T as correct in position 5, so T is only in position 5? Not necessarily, but we don't have information about other positions. However, we know T is at least in position 5. But the word might have another T? But we don't know.

But note: in the feedback, for ""point"", we have T(✓) in position 5, meaning that the 5th letter is T. It doesn't say anything about whether T appears elsewhere. However, since we don't have any other T in the guess, we don't know. But we must consider that the word might have only one T or multiple.

But in our case, we are trying to form a word with N in 4th and T in 5th, so the last two are fixed as ""NT"". The first three letters are what we need to guess.

Now, back to the list:

- BLUNT: B, L, U, N, T -> letters B, L, U are new and not excluded. So it's a candidate.
- FLINT: F, L, I, N, T -> but I is excluded (from guess2: I(x)), so invalid.
- GLINT: G, L, I, N, T -> I excluded, invalid.
- STINT: S, T, I, N, T -> I excluded, and also T is repeated? But we don't know if T can be repeated. However, the word ""stint"" has two T's? No: S-T-I-N-T, so positions: 1-S, 2-T, 3-I, 4-N, 5-T. But I is excluded, so invalid.
- VAUNT: V, A, U, N, T -> A is excluded (from guess1: A(x)), invalid.
- DAUNT: D, A, U, N, T -> A excluded, invalid.
- HAUNT: H, A, U, N, T -> A excluded, invalid.
- JAUNT: J, A, U, N, T -> A excluded, invalid.
- TAUNT: T, A, U, N, T -> A excluded, and also T repeated? But A is excluded.
- GAUNT: G, A, U, N, T -> A excluded.
- BUNTY? Not 5 letters? BUNT is 4, so no.

Another one: ""MINTY"" - but that ends with Y, not NT. We need ""NT"" at the end.

What about ""WONT""? But O is excluded and it's 4 letters? W-O-N-T, 4 letters? No, 4 letters. We need 5.

""COUNT"" is 5 but O excluded.

""MOUNT"" O excluded.

So, ""BLUNT"" seems a good candidate. But let's see if there are others.

""GRUNT"" has R, excluded.

""BRUNT"" has R and B? B-R-U-N-T -> R is excluded.

""SLANT"" has A and L, but A is excluded.

""PLANT"" has P, A, L? P and A excluded.

""GIANT"" has G, I, A, N, T -> I and A excluded.

So, ""BLUNT"" is one of the few that avoid the excluded letters.

Another possibility: ""STUNT"" - S, T, U, N, T. But T is repeated? The word is S-T-U-N-T. Now, we know T is in position 5, but we don't know if it can be in position 2. Also, we haven't tried S and U.

But in ""STUNT"", the second letter is T. We don't know if T is allowed in position 2. The feedback from ""point"" only told us that T is in position 5, but it doesn't prevent T from being in other positions. However, we must avoid the excluded letters. In ""STUNT"", we have S, T, U, N, T. The excluded letters are C, R, A, E, P, O, I. S, T, U are not excluded (T is known to be in the word, but we are allowed to use it again to test). So ""STUNT"" is also a candidate.

But note: in ""STUNT"", we are testing S in position 1, T in position 2, U in position 3, and then N and T in 4 and 5. This might be good because we test S, T (again), and U.

But we already know T is in the word, so testing T again might not give new information if it's the only T, but if it appears again, we get more information. However, since we are limited in words, it might be acceptable.

But let's see if there is a word that uses three new letters without repeating T.

Another word: ""DUNTS"" - but that ends with S? D-U-N-T-S, so the last two are T and S, not NT. We need the 4th to be N and 5th to be T, so the word must end with ""NT"".

""BUNTS"" is 5 letters? B-U-N-T-S, ends with TS, not NT.

""LUNTS"" same.

""MINTS"" has I and ends with TS.

What about ""WANTS""? But A is excluded.

Another idea: ""HINTS"" - but ends with TS and has I.

I think ""BLUNT"" and ""STUNT"" are the main candidates.

But ""BLUNT"" uses B, L, U, which are new, and ""STUNT"" uses S, T, U, but T is repeated.

We might also consider ""DUNTY""? Not a word.

Or ""MUNTY""? Not a word.

""JAUNT"" has A, excluded.

So, between ""BLUNT"" and ""STUNT"", which one to choose?

We want to test as many new letters as possible. ""BLUNT"" tests three new letters: B, L, U. ""STUNT"" tests two new letters: S and U (since T is already known, but we are testing it in a new position).

So ""BLUNT"" might be better because it tests three new letters.

But note: in ""BLUNT"", the U is in position 3, which is the position we are uncertain about.

We also have to consider that the word might be common.

Another candidate: ""FLUNG"" - but that ends with G, not T.

""CLUNG"" ends with G and has C.

No.

""GRUNT"" is invalid because of R.

So, let's go with ""BLUNT"".

But wait, is there ""VAUNT""? No, A excluded.

""DAUNT"" A excluded.

What about ""COUNT""? O excluded.

I think ""BLUNT"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm the letters: B, L, U, N, T. None of these are in the excluded list (C, R, A, E, P, O, I). So it's valid.

We can also consider ""STUNT"", but I think ""BLUNT"" is better because it doesn't repeat T and tests three new letters.

Another word: ""JUMPY"" - doesn't end with NT.

I think we should go with ""BLUNT"".

So the next guess is ""BLUNT"".

But note: we are on the third guess. We have 6 tries, so we can afford to test.

After this, we will get feedback on B, L, U.

If we get some correct, we can narrow down.

So, let's guess ""BLUNT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, R, A, and E are not in the word, and N is in the correct 4th position. So the word has the form `_ _ _ N _`.
- **Guess 2 (""point"")**: P, O, and I are not in the word, N is confirmed in the 4th position, and T is in the correct 5th position. This means the word ends with ""NT"" and has the form `_ _ _ N T`.

Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, A, E, P, O, I.  
Known correct letters: N (position 4), T (position 5).  

For the next guess:
- The word must be 5 letters, ending with ""NT"" (positions 4 and 5 fixed as N and T).
- It should avoid excluded letters and test new common letters (e.g., S, L, U, D, M, B, G) to maximize information about positions 1, 2, and 3.
- After evaluating possible words (e.g., ""blunt"", ""stunt"", ""grunt""), ""blunt"" was chosen because:
  - It fits the `_ _ _ N T` pattern.
  - It tests three new high-frequency letters: B (position 1), L (position 2), and U (position 3).
  - It avoids all excluded letters (C, R, A, E, P, O, I).
  - It is a common English word, making it a valid guess.

This guess will help identify if B, L, or U are in the word and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for the remaining guesses.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since we don't have any information yet, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have a combination of common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.

 Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels and frequent consonants. Some research suggests words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", etc.
 But note: the example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"". We'll choose a word that has five distinct letters and common ones.

 Let me choose a word: ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. These are fairly common.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a popular starter.

 However, to stick with a common starter, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 So my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

 We'll then get feedback and use that in the next step.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so the 4th letter is N)
- E: x (not in the word)

So we know:
- The 4th letter is N.
- The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.
- Therefore, the word has N in the 4th position and does not contain C, R, A, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has N in the 4th position (to confirm or get more information, but we already know that, so we can use it to test other letters).
- Avoids the letters C, R, A, E.
- Includes other common letters to maximize information.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We can try a word that has N in the 4th position and uses other common letters.

Possible words: 
- We know the word is 5 letters, 4th is N.

Let's think of words ending with N? Actually, the 4th letter is the fourth position, so the word is _ _ _ N _

We need to avoid C, R, A, E.

Let me list some words that fit:
- ""BLIND"": B, L, I, N, D -> but we don't know if B, L, I, D are in the word. However, we haven't tested these letters.
- ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> also avoids the forbidden letters.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since we know the 4th letter is N, we can try to use a word that has N in the 4th position and includes other common letters that we haven't tested.

Let me choose a word that has distinct letters and common ones: for example, ""POINT"" (P, O, I, N, T) or ""JOINT"" (J is less common) or ""MOUNT"" (M, O, U, N, T) but U is a vowel that might be less common.

Alternatively, ""SLING"": S, L, I, N, G -> but the 4th letter is N? Wait, SLING: positions: 1-S, 2-L, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G -> yes.

But we have to avoid E, A, R, C. ""SLING"" doesn't have any of these.

Another common word: ""STING"": S, T, I, N, G -> same as above but with T instead of L.

We might also consider ""POINT"" because it has P, O, I, T which are common.

But note: we don't know if the word has any of these. We are trying to cover more ground.

I think ""POINT"" is a good candidate because it uses P, O, I, T and N in the 4th position.

Alternatively, ""JOINT"" is similar but J is less common. So ""POINT"" is better.

Another option: ""BLUNT"" -> B, L, U, N, T. But U is a vowel that might be less common.

I think ""POINT"" is a solid choice.

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""POINT"" is a valid word.

So I'll go with ""POINT"".

We'll then get feedback on which letters are in the word and in which positions.

Let me write the guess: POINT

But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that the 4th letter is N, so in ""POINT"", the 4th letter is N, which is correct. We are hoping to get information about the other positions.

So the next guess is ""POINT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are not in the word (marked with ""x"").
- N is in the correct 4th position (marked with ""✓"").

This means:
- The secret word has the form: `_ _ _ N _`.
- The word does not contain C, R, A, or E.
- We should avoid these letters in the next guess and focus on testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, P, D, M) to maximize information.

For the second guess, I chose **""point""** because:
- It includes N in the 4th position (to maintain that known correct letter).
- It tests new common letters: P, O, I, and T (all high-frequency and not yet tried).
- It avoids the excluded letters (C, R, A, E).
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess will help identify if any of P, O, I, or T are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) N(✓) T(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct, in position 4)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""point""
- P: x (not in the word)
- O: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct, in position 4)
- T: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

So, from the feedback:
- The word has N in the 4th position and T in the 5th position. So the word ends with ""NT"".
- The letters C, R, A, E, P, O, I are all not in the word.

Therefore, the word is of the form: _ _ _ N T

We know the word has 5 letters: positions 1, 2, 3 are unknown, position 4 is N, position 5 is T.

We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, E, P, O, I.

We need to choose a word that:
- Has the 4th letter as N and 5th as T.
- Avoids the letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, I.
- Tests new common letters for positions 1, 2, and 3.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, L, U, D, M, B, G, K, W, V, Y, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible in the first three positions.

Possible words ending with ""NT"": 

We can think of words like:
- SAINT (but A is excluded, so invalid)
- JOINT (but O and I are excluded)
- MOUNT (but O is excluded)
- COUNT (O is excluded)
- HUNT (only 4 letters, too short)
- BUNT (but U and B are not tried, but let's see)

We need 5-letter words.

List of 5-letter words ending with ""NT"" that avoid C, R, A, E, P, O, I:

Possible candidates:
- BLUNT: B, L, U, N, T -> avoids the excluded letters? 
  Excluded: C, R, A, E, P, O, I. So B, L, U are new and allowed.
- GRUNT: G, R, U, N, T -> but R is excluded (from guess1: R(x)), so invalid.
- STUNT: S, T, U, N, T -> T is already known to be in position 5, but we can have T elsewhere? The feedback for T in ""point"" was in position 5, but it might be elsewhere? Actually, the feedback for ""point"" shows T as correct in position 5, so T is only in position 5? Not necessarily, but we don't have information about other positions. However, we know T is at least in position 5. But the word might have another T? But we don't know.

But note: in the feedback, for ""point"", we have T(✓) in position 5, meaning that the 5th letter is T. It doesn't say anything about whether T appears elsewhere. However, since we don't have any other T in the guess, we don't know. But we must consider that the word might have only one T or multiple.

But in our case, we are trying to form a word with N in 4th and T in 5th, so the last two are fixed as ""NT"". The first three letters are what we need to guess.

Now, back to the list:

- BLUNT: B, L, U, N, T -> letters B, L, U are new and not excluded. So it's a candidate.
- FLINT: F, L, I, N, T -> but I is excluded (from guess2: I(x)), so invalid.
- GLINT: G, L, I, N, T -> I excluded, invalid.
- STINT: S, T, I, N, T -> I excluded, and also T is repeated? But we don't know if T can be repeated. However, the word ""stint"" has two T's? No: S-T-I-N-T, so positions: 1-S, 2-T, 3-I, 4-N, 5-T. But I is excluded, so invalid.
- VAUNT: V, A, U, N, T -> A is excluded (from guess1: A(x)), invalid.
- DAUNT: D, A, U, N, T -> A excluded, invalid.
- HAUNT: H, A, U, N, T -> A excluded, invalid.
- JAUNT: J, A, U, N, T -> A excluded, invalid.
- TAUNT: T, A, U, N, T -> A excluded, and also T repeated? But A is excluded.
- GAUNT: G, A, U, N, T -> A excluded.
- BUNTY? Not 5 letters? BUNT is 4, so no.

Another one: ""MINTY"" - but that ends with Y, not NT. We need ""NT"" at the end.

What about ""WONT""? But O is excluded and it's 4 letters? W-O-N-T, 4 letters? No, 4 letters. We need 5.

""COUNT"" is 5 but O excluded.

""MOUNT"" O excluded.

So, ""BLUNT"" seems a good candidate. But let's see if there are others.

""GRUNT"" has R, excluded.

""BRUNT"" has R and B? B-R-U-N-T -> R is excluded.

""SLANT"" has A and L, but A is excluded.

""PLANT"" has P, A, L? P and A excluded.

""GIANT"" has G, I, A, N, T -> I and A excluded.

So, ""BLUNT"" is one of the few that avoid the excluded letters.

Another possibility: ""STUNT"" - S, T, U, N, T. But T is repeated? The word is S-T-U-N-T. Now, we know T is in position 5, but we don't know if it can be in position 2. Also, we haven't tried S and U.

But in ""STUNT"", the second letter is T. We don't know if T is allowed in position 2. The feedback from ""point"" only told us that T is in position 5, but it doesn't prevent T from being in other positions. However, we must avoid the excluded letters. In ""STUNT"", we have S, T, U, N, T. The excluded letters are C, R, A, E, P, O, I. S, T, U are not excluded (T is known to be in the word, but we are allowed to use it again to test). So ""STUNT"" is also a candidate.

But note: in ""STUNT"", we are testing S in position 1, T in position 2, U in position 3, and then N and T in 4 and 5. This might be good because we test S, T (again), and U.

But we already know T is in the word, so testing T again might not give new information if it's the only T, but if it appears again, we get more information. However, since we are limited in words, it might be acceptable.

But let's see if there is a word that uses three new letters without repeating T.

Another word: ""DUNTS"" - but that ends with S? D-U-N-T-S, so the last two are T and S, not NT. We need the 4th to be N and 5th to be T, so the word must end with ""NT"".

""BUNTS"" is 5 letters? B-U-N-T-S, ends with TS, not NT.

""LUNTS"" same.

""MINTS"" has I and ends with TS.

What about ""WANTS""? But A is excluded.

Another idea: ""HINTS"" - but ends with TS and has I.

I think ""BLUNT"" and ""STUNT"" are the main candidates.

But ""BLUNT"" uses B, L, U, which are new, and ""STUNT"" uses S, T, U, but T is repeated.

We might also consider ""DUNTY""? Not a word.

Or ""MUNTY""? Not a word.

""JAUNT"" has A, excluded.

So, between ""BLUNT"" and ""STUNT"", which one to choose?

We want to test as many new letters as possible. ""BLUNT"" tests three new letters: B, L, U. ""STUNT"" tests two new letters: S and U (since T is already known, but we are testing it in a new position).

So ""BLUNT"" might be better because it tests three new letters.

But note: in ""BLUNT"", the U is in position 3, which is the position we are uncertain about.

We also have to consider that the word might be common.

Another candidate: ""FLUNG"" - but that ends with G, not T.

""CLUNG"" ends with G and has C.

No.

""GRUNT"" is invalid because of R.

So, let's go with ""BLUNT"".

But wait, is there ""VAUNT""? No, A excluded.

""DAUNT"" A excluded.

What about ""COUNT""? O excluded.

I think ""BLUNT"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm the letters: B, L, U, N, T. None of these are in the excluded list (C, R, A, E, P, O, I). So it's valid.

We can also consider ""STUNT"", but I think ""BLUNT"" is better because it doesn't repeat T and tests three new letters.

Another word: ""JUMPY"" - doesn't end with NT.

I think we should go with ""BLUNT"".

So the next guess is ""BLUNT"".

But note: we are on the third guess. We have 6 tries, so we can afford to test.

After this, we will get feedback on B, L, U.

If we get some correct, we can narrow down.

So, let's guess ""BLUNT"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, R, A, and E are not in the word, and N is in the correct 4th position. So the word has the form `_ _ _ N _`.
- **Guess 2 (""point"")**: P, O, and I are not in the word, N is confirmed in the 4th position, and T is in the correct 5th position. This means the word ends with ""NT"" and has the form `_ _ _ N T`.

Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, A, E, P, O, I.  
Known correct letters: N (position 4), T (position 5).  

For the next guess:
- The word must be 5 letters, ending with ""NT"" (positions 4 and 5 fixed as N and T).
- It should avoid excluded letters and test new common letters (e.g., S, L, U, D, M, B, G) to maximize information about positions 1, 2, and 3.
- After evaluating possible words (e.g., ""blunt"", ""stunt"", ""grunt""), ""blunt"" was chosen because:
  - It fits the `_ _ _ N T` pattern.
  - It tests three new high-frequency letters: B (position 1), L (position 2), and U (position 3).
  - It avoids all excluded letters (C, R, A, E, P, O, I).
  - It is a common English word, making it a valid guess.

This guess will help identify if B, L, or U are in the word and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for the remaining guesses.

We don\'t know if T is allowed in position 2. The feedback from ""point"" only told us that T is in position 5, but it doesn\'t prevent T from being in other positions. However, we must avoid the excluded letters. In ""STUNT"", we have S, T, U, N, T. The excluded letters are C, R, A, E, P, O, I. S, T, U are not excluded (T is known to be in the word, but we are allowed to use it again to test). So ""STUNT"" is also a candidate.\n\nBut note: in ""STUNT"", we are testing S in position 1, T in position 2, U in position 3, and then N and T in 4 and 5.

B-U-N-T-S, ends with TS, not NT.\n\n""LUNTS"" same.\n\n""MINTS"" has I and ends with TS.\n\nWhat about ""WANTS""? But A is excluded.\n\nAnother idea: ""HINTS"" - but ends with TS and has I.\n\nI think ""BLUNT"" and ""STUNT"" are the main candidates.\n\nBut ""BLUNT"" uses B, L, U, which are new, and ""STUNT"" uses S, T, U, but T is repeated.\n\nWe might also consider ""DUNTY""? Not a word.\n\nOr ""MUNTY""? Not a word.\n\n""JAUNT"" has A, excluded.\n\nSo, between ""BLUNT"" and ""STUNT"", which one to choose?\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible.

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  - C: not in word
  - R: not in word
  - A: not in word
  - N: correct and in position 4
  - E: not in word

Guess 2: ""point""
  - P: not in word
  - O: not in word
  - I: not in word
  - N: correct and in position 4 (already known)
  - T: correct and in position 5

Guess 3: ""blunt""
  - B: not in word
  - L: not in word
  - U: correct and in position? The feedback shows U(✓) and it was in position 3 of ""blunt"". Since it's marked with ✓, that means U is in the word and in the correct position. So U is in position 3.
  - N: correct and in position 4 (already known)
  - T: correct and in position 5 (already known)

So, from the feedback:
- U is in the correct position 3. Therefore, the word has the form: _ _ U N T
- Also, we have more exclusions: B and L are not in the word.

Now, we know the word is _ _ U N T

We know the word does not contain: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, B, L

We need to find a word of the form: ? ? U N T

We should test possible letters for positions 1 and 2.

Common letters remaining: S, D, G, F, H, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.

We are missing the first two positions.

We have to choose a word that:
- Has U in position 3, N in 4, T in 5.
- Avoids the excluded letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, B, L.
- Tests new letters for positions 1 and 2.

Possible words:

We can think of words ending with ""UNT"": but note, since position 3 is U, 4 is N, 5 is T, so the last three are ""UNT"", but actually, position 3,4,5: U, N, T -> so it's ... U N T

Words that fit: first two letters plus ""UNT"", but avoiding excluded letters.

List of common 5-letter words of the form ? ? U N T:

- HUNT? But that's H U N T, which is 4 letters? No, ""HUNT"" is 4 letters. We need 5 letters: so positions 1,2,3,4,5: 1 and 2 must be filled.

So:

- DAUNT: but A is excluded, and it's D A U N T -> position 2 is A, which is excluded.
- GAUNT: G A U N T -> A excluded.
- HAUNT: H A U N T -> A excluded.
- JAUNT: J A U N T -> A excluded.
- VAUNT: V A U N T -> A excluded.
- TAUNT: T A U N T -> A excluded, and also T is repeated? But we know T is at position 5, but here position 1 is T? So T in position 1? We don't know if T can be elsewhere.

But TAUNT has T in position 1 and position 5. A is excluded.

Now, with excluded letters, we need words without A.

What about ""SHUNT"": S H U N T -> positions: 1-S, 2-H, 3-U, 4-N, 5-T?
But ""SHUNT"" is a word: it means to divert or push aside.

Does it have 5 letters? Yes: S-H-U-N-T.

Similarly, ""GRUNT"": G R U N T -> but R is excluded (from guess1), so invalid.

""STUNT"": S T U N T -> we considered this before, but let's see: positions: 1-S, 2-T, 3-U, 4-N, 5-T. Now, T is in position 2 and 5. But we know T is at position 5, so position 2 is another T? But T might be duplicated? It's possible. And letters: S,T,U,N,T. Are any excluded? S and T: T is already known to be in the word, but we are testing a second T. But the excluded letters are C,R,A,E,P,O,I,B,L. S and T are not excluded. So ""STUNT"" is possible.

Another word: ""MOUNT"": M O U N T -> O is excluded (from guess2), so invalid.

""COUNT"": C O U N T -> C and O excluded.

What about other words:

- ""DUNTS"": D U N T S? That would be positions: 1-D, 2-U, 3-N, 4-T, 5-S? But wait, we need position 3 to be U, not position 2. So ""DUNTS"" has U in position 2? That doesn't fit; we need U in position 3.

Similarly, ""BUNTS"": B U N T S -> U in position 2, not 3.

Words with U in third position:

Therefore, back to ""SHUNT"": 1-S, 2-H, 3-U, 4-N, 5-T? But H is allowed? H hasn't been tested, so yes.

Another: ""JAUNT"" is invalid due to A.

""FLUNT""? Not a word.

""GLUNT""? Not a word.

""SLUNT""? Not a word.

""BRUNT"": B R U N T -> B and R are excluded.

""TRUNT""? Not a word.

""SHUNT"" or ""STUNT"" seem like the only common ones.

""WHUNT""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""AUNTS"" but A excluded and U in second position, wrong.

So, candidates: ""SHUNT"" and ""STUNT"".

Now, which one to choose?

""SHUNT"" tests new letters: S in position 1 and H in position 2.

""STUNT"" tests S in position 1, and T in position 2 (but we know T is already in the word at position 5, so if T is duplicated, we get info; if not, we know T is only at 5).

But we don't know if T is duplicated.

We could choose ""SHUNT"" to test H, which is a common letter.

We might also consider other possible words? For example, ""MUNT""-something? Not really.

Another word: ""DUNGY""? Not the pattern.

Perhaps ""KWUNT""? Not a word.

I think ""SHUNT"" and ""STUNT"" are the main options.

Now, we are on the fourth guess. We have 6 tries, so we can try one of these.

Note: if we guess ""STUNT"", and if the word is ""STUNT"", we solve it. Otherwise, we get feedback that may reveal the first two letters.

Similarly for ""SHUNT"".

But we might also use a word that includes other common letters to get more information if we are not sure.

We could guess a word that has U,N,T in positions 3,4,5, but uses two new letters in positions 1 and 2 that are common.

For example, ""SHUNT"" uses S and H.

""STUNT"" uses S and T (but T is known).

Another possibility: ""GRUNT"" is invalid.

What about ""SMUNT""? Not a word.

Or ""SWUNT""? I don't think it's a word.

Perhaps ""HUNTS"" - but that has H U N T S, so U in position 2? No.

All candidates must have the third letter as U.

Therefore, ""SHUNT"" seems a good choice because it tests S and H, both new letters.

But H is in position 2.

If we guess ""SHUNT"", positions:
- 1: S
- 2: H
- 3: U (correct)
- 4: N (correct)
- 5: T (correct)

We get feedback on S and H.

Similarly, ""STUNT"" would test S and T (for position 2).

Given that we haven't tried S and H, and they are common, ""SHUNT"" might be better because it tests a completely new letter H.

In ""STUNT"", T is known to be in the word, so if we put T in position 2, we might get:
- If T is also in position 2, then we have two T's, and it would show ✓ for T in position 2.
- If not, then it would show - or x? But since T is in the word at position 5, putting T in position 2, if it's not correct, it should show - because the letter is in the word but wrong position? Only if there is another T. But if the word has only one T, then it should show x for the first T? Actually, no: the feedback symbol depends on whether the letter exists and the position.

But note: in Wordle-like games, if a letter is duplicated, it gets complicated, but here the rules are similar.

But in our case, to avoid complexity, perhaps testing a new letter is better.

So I think ""SHUNT"" is a good guess.

Or perhaps ""DAUNT"" but A excluded.

Another word: ""FAUNT""? Not common.

So, I'll go with ""SHUNT"".

But let me confirm: is ""SHUNT"" a valid English word? Yes, it is.

Therefore, next guess: ""SHUNT"".

We hope that if S or H are in the word, we get information.

But note: it could be that neither S nor H is in the word, then we know that position 1 and 2 must be other letters.

But we have limited letters left.

Another possibility: ""GHUNT""? Probably not a word.

Or ""SKUNT""? Not a word.

So, ""SHUNT"" it is.

Let's guess ""SHUNT"".Based on the cumulative feedback:
- **Pattern established**: The word must have U in position 3, N in position 4, and T in position 5 (`_ _ U N T`).
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, B, L (all not in the word).
- **New information from Guess 3 (""blunt"")**: U is confirmed in position 3, so the word is `? ? U N T`.

For the next guess, the ideal word:
- Must fit `? ? U N T`.
- Should test new high-frequency letters for positions 1 and 2.
- Must avoid excluded letters.

Potential words include:
- **SHUNT**: Tests S (position 1) and H (position 2). Both are common unused letters, and ""shunt"" is valid.
- **STUNT**: Tests S (position 1) and T (position 2). T is known to be in position 5, so this may test for duplicate T.

Chose **""shunt""** because:
- It prioritizes testing two completely new letters (S and H), maximizing information if either is in the word.
- Avoids reusing known letters unnecessarily.
- If ""shunt"" is correct, we solve it; otherwise, feedback clarifies positions 1 and 2.

This leaves other possibilities (e.g., if excluded, we pursue words like ""stunt"", ""daunt"" — but A excluded—or rarer words).

<guess>shunt</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- The word has **U in position 3**, **N in position 4**, and **T in position 5**, so the pattern is `_ _ U N T`.
- Excluded letters (not in the word): **C, R, A, E, P, O, I, B, L**.
- Remaining positions to guess: **1 and 2**.

For the next guess:
- I chose **""shunt""** because:
  - It fits the pattern `S H U N T`, adhering to the known correct letters in positions 3-5.
  - It tests two new high-frequency letters: **S** (position 1) and **H** (position 2).
  - Both S and H are untried and common in English words.
  - This maximizes information about positions 1 and 2, as feedback will clearly indicate if S or H is present and correctly positioned.

Alternatives like ""stunt"" were considered, but reusing T (a known letter) in position 2 provides less new information, while ""shunt"" introduces two fresh letters.
