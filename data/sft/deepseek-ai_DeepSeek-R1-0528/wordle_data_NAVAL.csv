We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
N: - (in the word but wrong position)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". In ""crane"", A was at position 3 and N at position 4 (using 1-indexing: positions 1,2,3,4,5). Therefore, A cannot be at position 3 and N cannot be at position 4.
- The letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes A and N (since they are present in the word) but not at positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Excludes C, R, E.

Additionally, we don't know the positions of A and N. We also don't know what other letters are in the word.

We need to pick a word that uses other common letters to gather more information.

Common letters in English 5-letter words (besides the ones we've tried) might include: T, O, I, S, L, etc.

We also note that the word must have A and N, so we can try to form a word that has A and N in new positions.

Possible positions for A: since it was at position 3 in the first guess, it cannot be at position 3. So A can be at positions 1,2,4,5.
Similarly, N was at position 4, so it cannot be at position 4. So N can be at positions 1,2,3,5.

We also want to avoid C, R, E.

Let's think of words that have A and N, and use other common letters.

For example, we can try words like:
- ""PLANT"": but note that we have to avoid R and E? Actually, we don't have to avoid P, L, T. But let's check: 
  P, L, A, N, T. 
  However, we don't know if P, L, T are in the word. Also, in ""plant"", A is at position 3? Wait, in ""plant"": 
  P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). 
  But in our feedback, A was at position 3 and we were told it's in the word but wrong position. So A cannot be at position 3. Similarly, N was at position 4 and cannot be at position 4. 
  In ""plant"", A is at 3 and N at 4, which are the forbidden positions. So we cannot use ""plant"" because it puts A and N in the same positions we already know are wrong.

We need a word that has A and N in different positions.

Another idea: ""SANDY"" -> S, A, N, D, Y. 
Positions: A at 2, N at 3. 
But we don't know if S, D, Y are allowed? We haven't ruled them out. 
Also, note that in the first guess, A was at 3 and now we put it at 2, which is allowed. N was at 4 and now we put it at 3, which is also allowed (since the feedback only said N was not at 4, but 3 is new). 
But wait, we have to avoid R and E? Yes, but S, D, Y are not R or E. 

However, we must also consider that we have two letters we know are in the word: A and N. We want to test other letters too. 

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and N and also includes other common letters we haven't tried. 

Another common starting word is ""AUDIO"", but that has A at position 1 and we don't have N. We need to include N.

Let me think of words with A and N that are not in positions 3 and 4.

Possible words:
- ""MANGO"": M, A, N, G, O. 
  Positions: A at 2, N at 3. 
  But we don't know if M, G, O are in the word. Also, we avoid C, R, E. 
  However, note that in the first guess, we had A at 3 and now we put it at 2 -> allowed. N was at 4 and now at 3 -> allowed. 
  But we are using M, G, O which are new.

- ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T. 
  Positions: A at 2, N at 4? Wait: P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). 
  But we cannot have N at position 4 because in the first guess N was at 4 and we were told it's in the word but wrong position. So N cannot be at 4. Therefore, ""paint"" is invalid because it puts N at 4.

- ""TANGY"": T, A, N, G, Y. 
  Positions: A at 2, N at 3. 
  This avoids the forbidden positions: A not at 3, N not at 4. 
  And we use T, G, Y which are new.

- ""SNAIL"": S, N, A, I, L. 
  Positions: N at 2, A at 3. 
  But A at 3 is forbidden (from first feedback: A was at 3 and it was wrong position). So we cannot put A at 3. Therefore, ""snail"" is invalid.

- ""NASTY"": N, A, S, T, Y. 
  Positions: N at 1, A at 2. 
  This is good because A is not at 3 and N is not at 4. 
  Also, we test S, T, Y.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn't indicate any duplicates so far, but we don't know.

We can choose ""NASTY"". Let me check if it's a valid word: yes.

Alternatively, we can choose ""MANGO"", but I think ""NASTY"" is a good choice because it puts N at position 1 (which we haven't tested) and A at 2 (also new). 

But note: we are also testing S, T, Y. 

Another option: ""DAISY"" but that doesn't have N. We must include both A and N because we know they are in the word.

So, I think ""NASTY"" is a good candidate.

But wait: in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and it was present but wrong position. Now in ""NASTY"", A is at position 2. Similarly, N is at position 1 (previously at 4). 

We are also avoiding C, R, E.

So, let's go with ""NASTY"".

But note: we are using the letter S. We don't know if S is in the word. Similarly, T and Y.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has A and N and also includes letters that are common and we haven't tried. 

Another word: ""LATIN"" -> L, A, T, I, N. 
Positions: A at 2, N at 5. 
This is good because A is not at 3 and N is not at 4. 
But we are using L, T, I. 

However, we don't have information about I. 

But note: we are trying to maximize information. 

I think both ""NASTY"" and ""LATIN"" are reasonable. 

But let me consider: we have two known letters (A and N) and we want to test three new ones. 

In ""NASTY"", we are testing N at position 1, A at 2, and then S, T, Y. 

In ""LATIN"", we are testing A at 2, T at 3, I at 4, N at 5. 

We might get more information from ""NASTY"" because we are testing N at a new position (1) and A at 2, and then three new letters. 

But note: we are also testing the position of A and N. 

Alternatively, we can try to put A in a position we haven't tried, like position 1? 

For example: ""ANKLE"" but E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). 

""ANVIL"": A, N, V, I, L. 
Positions: A at 1, N at 2. 
But we avoid E, but V and I and L are new. 

But we don't know if V is common. 

I think ""NASTY"" is a good choice. 

Let me check the frequency of letters: 
Common consonants: S, T, L, N, R (but R is out), D, M, etc. 
Vowels: A, E (out), I, O, U.

We have A already. We might want to test other vowels? 

But we have two vowels: A and we don't know the others. 

We can try a word with A and another vowel. 

But we must include N. 

So, ""NASTY"" has A and the rest are consonants. 

Another word: ""OASIS"" but that doesn't have N and has duplicate S. 

We need N. 

""CANAL"" but C is out. 

""MANIA"": M, A, N, I, A -> duplicate A? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. 
Also, positions: A at 2 and 5. But we are not sure. 
And we avoid C, R, E. 
But in ""MANIA"", A is at position 2 and 5. We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. 
Also, N is at position 3. But we don't have feedback about N at 3. Previously N was at 4 and that was wrong. 
But we are allowed to put N at 3. 

However, we are using M and I. 

But I think it's better to avoid duplicates for now because we don't have evidence of duplicates. 

So, I'll go with ""NASTY"". 

Therefore, my second guess is ""NASTY"".

We'll write it as: <guess>nasty</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").
- **N** is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include **A** and **N** (since they are confirmed present), but avoid placing A at position 3 or N at position 4.
- It must exclude **C, R, E** entirely.
- To maximize information, I chose a word with common unused letters (S, T, Y) and repositioned A and N to untested slots (A at position 2, N at position 1).

""NASTY"" fits these criteria:
- N is at position 1 (new position, not 4).
- A is at position 2 (new position, not 3).
- S, T, Y are new letters to test.
- It avoids C, R, E.

R: x (not in the word)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
N: - (in the word but wrong position)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". In ""crane"", A was at position 3 and N at position 4 (using 1-indexing: positions 1,2,3,4,5). Therefore, A cannot be at position 3 and N cannot be at position 4.
- The letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes A and N (since they are present in the word) but not at positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Excludes C, R, E.

Additionally, we don't know the positions of A and N. We also don't know what other letters are in the word.

We need to pick a word that uses other common letters to gather more information.

Common letters in English 5-letter words (besides the ones we've tried) might include: T, O, I, S, L, etc.

We also note that the word must have A and N, so we can try to form a word that has A and N in new positions.

Possible positions for A: since it was at position 3 in the first guess, it cannot be at position 3. So A can be at positions 1,2,4,5.
Similarly, N was at position 4, so it cannot be at position 4. So N can be at positions 1,2,3,5.

We also want to avoid C, R, E.

Let's think of words that have A and N, and use other common letters.

For example, we can try words like:
- ""PLANT"": but note that we have to avoid R and E? Actually, we don't have to avoid P, L, T. But let's check: 
  P, L, A, N, T. 
  However, we don't know if P, L, T are in the word. Also, in ""plant"", A is at position 3? Wait, in ""plant"": 
  P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). 
  But in our feedback, A was at position 3 and we were told it's in the word but wrong position. So A cannot be at position 3. Similarly, N was at position 4 and cannot be at position 4. 
  In ""plant"", A is at 3 and N at 4, which are the forbidden positions. So we cannot use ""plant"" because it puts A and N in the same positions we already know are wrong.

We need a word that has A and N in different positions.

Another idea: ""SANDY"" -> S, A, N, D, Y. 
Positions: A at 2, N at 3. 
But we don't know if S, D, Y are allowed? We haven't ruled them out. 
Also, note that in the first guess, A was at 3 and now we put it at 2, which is allowed. N was at 4 and now we put it at 3, which is also allowed (since the feedback only said N was not at 4, but 3 is new). 
But wait, we have to avoid R and E? Yes, but S, D, Y are not R or E. 

However, we must also consider that we have two letters we know are in the word: A and N. We want to test other letters too. 

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and N and also includes other common letters we haven't tried. 

Another common starting word is ""AUDIO"", but that has A at position 1 and we don't have N. We need to include N.

Let me think of words with A and N that are not in positions 3 and 4.

Possible words:
- ""MANGO"": M, A, N, G, O. 
  Positions: A at 2, N at 3. 
  But we don't know if M, G, O are in the word. Also, we avoid C, R, E. 
  However, note that in the first guess, we had A at 3 and now we put it at 2 -> allowed. N was at 4 and now at 3 -> allowed. 
  But we are using M, G, O which are new.

- ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T. 
  Positions: A at 2, N at 4? Wait: P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). 
  But we cannot have N at position 4 because in the first guess N was at 4 and we were told it's in the word but wrong position. So N cannot be at 4. Therefore, ""paint"" is invalid because it puts N at 4.

- ""TANGY"": T, A, N, G, Y. 
  Positions: A at 2, N at 3. 
  This avoids the forbidden positions: A not at 3, N not at 4. 
  And we use T, G, Y which are new.

- ""SNAIL"": S, N, A, I, L. 
  Positions: N at 2, A at 3. 
  But A at 3 is forbidden (from first feedback: A was at 3 and it was wrong position). So we cannot put A at 3. Therefore, ""snail"" is invalid.

- ""NASTY"": N, A, S, T, Y. 
  Positions: N at 1, A at 2. 
  This is good because A is not at 3 and N is not at 4. 
  Also, we test S, T, Y.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn't indicate any duplicates so far, but we don't know.

We can choose ""NASTY"". Let me check if it's a valid word: yes.

Alternatively, we can choose ""MANGO"", but I think ""NASTY"" is a good choice because it puts N at position 1 (which we haven't tested) and A at 2 (also new). 

But note: we are also testing S, T, Y. 

Another option: ""DAISY"" but that doesn't have N. We must include both A and N because we know they are in the word.

So, I think ""NASTY"" is a good candidate.

But wait: in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and it was present but wrong position. Now in ""NASTY"", A is at position 2. Similarly, N is at position 1 (previously at 4). 

We are also avoiding C, R, E.

So, let's go with ""NASTY"".

But note: we are using the letter S. We don't know if S is in the word. Similarly, T and Y.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has A and N and also includes letters that are common and we haven't tried. 

Another word: ""LATIN"" -> L, A, T, I, N. 
Positions: A at 2, N at 5. 
This is good because A is not at 3 and N is not at 4. 
But we are using L, T, I. 

However, we don't have information about I. 

But note: we are trying to maximize information. 

I think both ""NASTY"" and ""LATIN"" are reasonable. 

But let me consider: we have two known letters (A and N) and we want to test three new ones. 

In ""NASTY"", we are testing N at position 1, A at 2, and then S, T, Y. 

In ""LATIN"", we are testing A at 2, T at 3, I at 4, N at 5. 

We might get more information from ""NASTY"" because we are testing N at a new position (1) and A at 2, and then three new letters. 

But note: we are also testing the position of A and N. 

Alternatively, we can try to put A in a position we haven't tried, like position 1? 

For example: ""ANKLE"" but E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). 

""ANVIL"": A, N, V, I, L. 
Positions: A at 1, N at 2. 
But we avoid E, but V and I and L are new. 

But we don't know if V is common. 

I think ""NASTY"" is a good choice. 

Let me check the frequency of letters: 
Common consonants: S, T, L, N, R (but R is out), D, M, etc. 
Vowels: A, E (out), I, O, U.

We have A already. We might want to test other vowels? 

But we have two vowels: A and we don't know the others. 

We can try a word with A and another vowel. 

But we must include N. 

So, ""NASTY"" has A and the rest are consonants. 

Another word: ""OASIS"" but that doesn't have N and has duplicate S. 

We need N. 

""CANAL"" but C is out. 

""MANIA"": M, A, N, I, A -> duplicate A? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. 
Also, positions: A at 2 and 5. But we are not sure. 
And we avoid C, R, E. 
But in ""MANIA"", A is at position 2 and 5. We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. 
Also, N is at position 3. But we don't have feedback about N at 3. Previously N was at 4 and that was wrong. 
But we are allowed to put N at 3. 

However, we are using M and I. 

But I think it's better to avoid duplicates for now because we don't have evidence of duplicates. 

So, I'll go with ""NASTY"". 

Therefore, my second guess is ""NASTY"".

We'll write it as: <guess>nasty</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").
- **N** is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include **A** and **N** (since they are confirmed present), but avoid placing A at position 3 or N at position 4.
- It must exclude **C, R, E** entirely.
- To maximize information, I chose a word with common unused letters (S, T, Y) and repositioned A and N to untested slots (A at position 2, N at position 1).

""NASTY"" fits these criteria:
- N is at position 1 (new position, not 4).
- A is at position 2 (new position, not 3).
- S, T, Y are new letters to test.
- It avoids C, R, E.

We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C(x): C is not in the word.
- R(x): R is not in the word.
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(-): N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

Second guess: ""nasty""
- N(✓): N is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- A(✓): A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- T(x): T is not in the word.
- Y(x): Y is not in the word.

So, from this we know:
- The first letter is N.
- The second letter is A.
- Therefore, the secret word starts with ""NA"".
- The letters C, R, E, S, T, Y are not in the word at all.
- Also, we know that N is at position 1 (so it cannot be elsewhere), and A is at position 2 (so it cannot be elsewhere).

We also have the information from the first guess:
- A was at position 3 in ""crane"" and was wrong, but now we know A is at position 2, which is consistent.
- N was at position 4 in ""crane"" and was wrong, but now we know N is at position 1.

Now, we know the word starts with ""NA"", and we have three more letters to find.

We also know that the remaining three letters must be from the unused letters, and we must avoid C, R, E, S, T, Y.

Moreover, we know from the first guess that the word contains at least one more letter that we haven't placed: in ""crane"", we had A and N present (but wrong positions), and the other letters (C,R,E) are absent. This doesn't give us more letters because we already accounted for A and N.

So, we have:
- Positions 1: N (fixed)
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Positions 3,4,5: unknown, but cannot be C,R,E,S,T,Y.

We need to think of common English words starting with ""NA"".

We must avoid: C, R, E, S, T, Y.

Common letters that might appear: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, etc.

We have only 4 guesses left (since two used).

A good strategy is to choose a word that tests common letters for the remaining positions.

Possible words starting with ""NA"":
- ""NAVAL"" - but contains V and L? And A appears twice? We don't know if duplicate letters are allowed. Also, we have A at position 2, so the A at position 4 would be extra. But we don't know if the word has two A's.
- ""NADIR"" - but R is forbidden.
- ""NAIVE"" - but E is forbidden.
- ""NAPPY"" - but Y is forbidden and P is new? But Y is out.
- ""NAILS"" - S is forbidden.
- ""NAKED"" - E is forbidden.
- ""NAMES"" - E and S are forbidden.
- ""NATAL"" - T is forbidden? T is forbidden because in guess 2, T was in ""nasty"" and got (x). Also, note that ""NATAL"" has T at position 3 which is forbidden.

We need to avoid T, as per guess 2.

So let's list words without the forbidden letters: avoid C, R, E, S, T, Y.

Some possibilities:
- ""NAGUA"" - not common, and we are limited to five letters? ""NAGUA"" is not standard.
- ""NABLA"" - B and L? Also, has A again.
- ""NAVEL"" - V and L? But E is forbidden. N A V E L -> E is excluded.
- ""NAVAL"" - V and L? This might work: N(1) A(2) V(3) A(4) L(5) -> but duplicate A? We don't know if duplicate A is allowed. And V and L are new.

We need to consider the possibilities.

Alternatively, without duplicates? But we don't have any duplicate letters so far, but it's possible.

Another word: ""NAILS"" is out because of S.

""NADIR"" has R.

""NABOB"" - B and O? Also, has duplicate B? N A B O B -> but duplicates and O. This word is valid? Let me check: Yes, ""nabob"" is a word.

But we are trying to gather information. We could choose a word that tests common letters.

Since we know the first two letters are NA, we can try to use words that cover multiple common letters.

But note: we have positions 3,4,5 to guess.

We don't know any of these letters. Maybe we can choose a word that includes letters like I, O, L, B, D, etc.

Possible words:
- ""NABIS"" - but S is forbidden.
- ""NAIAD"" - A appears again? And I, D? But the word: N A I A D -> positions: 1:N, 2:A, 3:I, 4:A, 5:D. So duplicate A, which we aren't sure about.

To avoid duplication for now, we can assume there might be none? But we don't know.

Another word: ""NADAS"" - S forbidden.

Perhaps ""NAHAL"" - which has H, A, L? But duplicate A? N A H A L -> same issue.

Maybe ""NAIRA"" - R forbidden? ""NAIRA"" has R? N A I R A -> yes, R is at position 4, and R is forbidden.

Looking for words that avoid duplicates and forbidden letters.

Try ""NAVAL"" - but that has two A's.

In ""NAVAL"", the first A is at position 2 (which is correct) and the second A at position 4.

We were told A is in the word and in position 2 from guess 2, but we don't know if there is another A.

We might get feedback that would tell us.

But to be safe, it might be better to assume no duplicate until proven otherwise? We haven't had feedback indicating duplicates.

Another word: ""NAMED"" - E forbidden.

""NAFTA"" - F, T? T is forbidden (from guess 2). N A F T A -> T at position 4, and we know T is out.

So, forbidden letters include T.

What about ""NAGGY"" - Y forbidden.

""NAPPY"" - Y forbidden and P is new? But Y is forbidden.

Perhaps we need letters like O, L, P, B, D, G.

After filtering, let's consider:

Possible words starting with ""NA"" that do not contain C,R,E,S,T,Y and without duplicate for A? Or with duplicate? We might have to include duplicates.

Since we want to test if there is another A, but we can also test other letters.

But to maximize information, we can include a variety of letters.

One common word: ""NAIVE"" - forbidden E.

""NADIR"" - forbidden R.

""NALED"" - forbidden E.

""NAPAL"" - not a word.

""NAPPY"" - forbidden Y.

""NAVEL"" - forbidden E.

""NAIAD"" - forbidden? Letters: N,A,I,A,D -> forbidden letters? D is new, I is new. But duplicate A? So let's consider it: N A I A D.

We don't know if A appears twice.

But D and I are new. However, perhaps there is a better word.

Another idea: ""NAVEL"" is out.

What about ""NAILS"" - forbidden S.

Alternatively, ""NABOR"" - R forbidden.

""NAGOR"" - R forbidden.

""NABLA"" - B and L? N A B L A -> has duplicate A? Also, ""nabla"" is a word? Yes, but A at two positions.

We might not have many options without including the forbidden letters.

Let me think of common words: ""NATAL"" - forbidden T.

""NAOMI"" - O, M, I? N A O M I -> letters O, M, I are new. And no forbidden letters. But ""NAOMI"" is a name and might be accepted? We consider it valid.

Another: ""NABOB"" - N A B O B -> letters B, O. Also, the word is valid.

Or ""NAGAS"" - S forbidden.

We can also try ""NABIS"" - S forbidden.

Perhaps ""NAAPA"" - not a word.

Let's check ""NAPOL"" - not a word.

Alternatively, how about ""NADAS"" - S forbidden.

Given the constraints, I think we can try ""NABOB"" or ""NAOMI"".

But we have to be cautious. Another common word: ""NADIR"" is out.

Let me list:

- ""NAVEL"": forbidden E.
- ""NAVAL"": possible if we allow duplicates. But we can test V and L? Also, V is less common.
- ""NAIRA"": forbidden R.
- ""NAIVE"": forbidden E.
- ""NANDU"" - U? N A N D U -> has duplicate N? But we know N is at position 1, so another N would be possible? But in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was wrong, and in the second guess, N at position 1 is correct. But we don't know whether there is another N.

In ""NANDU"": N(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), U(5). So duplicate N.

But note: the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't have information.

We can try words without duplicates first to simplify.

Possible without duplicates and without forbidden letters:

Letters available: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,U,V,W,Z (and possibly others)

Common combinations:

- ""NAVAL"" has duplicate A? So invalid for no dup.
- ""NADIR"" has R -> out.
- ""NAIAD"" has duplicate A -> out.
- ""NABOB"" has duplicate B -> out.
- ""NAOMI"": N A O M I -> unique letters: O, M, I. All new. No duplicates. No forbidden letters.

Is ""NAOMI"" a word? Yes, a name and accepted as a word. For Wordle, names are sometimes accepted? But note: the game rules say ""valid 5-letter English word"", so we have to be careful.

Another word: ""NAPPY"" forbidden Y.

""NAGGY"" forbidden Y.

""NABES"" forbidden S and E.

""NAPPE"" forbidden E.

""NABOK"" not a word.

Another common word: ""NAVAR"" forbidden R.

Or ""NAVAR"" doesn't exist? 

Perhaps ""NAVEL"": out.

Let's consider ""NAHAL"" - not common, but accepted? Has duplicate A? N A H A L.

Duplicate A.

Perhaps ""NAFFA"" - not a word.

I think ""NAOMI"" is acceptable.

But let's confirm: In Wordle, ""NAOMI"" is used.

Alternatively, ""NABOB"" has duplicates? It has two B's, but those can be at different positions.

But we are testing multiple new letters.

Another word: ""NALLA"" - not common and duplicate L? N A L L A -> duplicates.

Perhaps we use ""NAGLF"" - not a word.

What about ""NAIKS"": S forbidden.

So, given the constraints, ""NAOMI"" seems reasonable.

Structuring the guess: ""NAOMI"" -> letters: N, A, O, M, I.

N is first (should be correct), A second (correct), then O at 3, M at 4, I at 5.

This tests O, M, and I in positions 3,4,5.

If the secret word does not have O, M, or I, we will know.

We have 4 guesses left, so it's okay.

Another possibility: ""NAPALM"" - that's 6 letters.

Too long.

""NADA"" - too short.

So, using ""NAOMI"" to test common vowels (O and I) and M.

Alternatively, ""NAMMA"" - duplicate M? Not common.

I'll go with ""NAOMI"".

But note: we are testing an 'O' and 'I' which are vowels.

We can also consider a word like ""NAGOR"" -> forbidden R.

No.

""NAVAR"" forbidden.

So, we choose ""NAOMI"".

Therefore, the third guess is ""NAOMI"".

<guess>naomi</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- From Guess 1 (""crane""): We know the secret word contains **A** and **N**, but not at positions 3 and 4 respectively. Letters **C**, **R**, and **E** are excluded.
- From Guess 2 (""nasty""): We know the first letter is **N** (✓), the second letter is **A** (✓), and letters **S**, **T**, and **Y** are excluded.

This means:
- The secret word starts with ""NA"".
- Positions 3–5 are unknown, but must consist of letters not in {C, R, E, S, T, Y}.
- No duplicates have been indicated yet, but they are possible.

For the third guess, I chose ""NAOMI"" because:
- It confirms the known ""NA"" start.
- It tests three new, common vowels/consonants (**O**, **M**, **I**) in positions 3–5 without forbidden letters.
- It leverages common English word patterns to maximize feedback coverage.

<guess>naomi</guess>",naomi,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C(x): C is not in the word.
- R(x): R is not in the word.
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(-): N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

Second guess: ""nasty""
- N(✓): N is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- A(✓): A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- T(x): T is not in the word.
- Y(x): Y is not in the word.

So, from this we know:
- The first letter is N.
- The second letter is A.
- Therefore, the secret word starts with ""NA"".
- The letters C, R, E, S, T, Y are not in the word at all.
- Also, we know that N is at position 1 (so it cannot be elsewhere), and A is at position 2 (so it cannot be elsewhere).

We also have the information from the first guess:
- A was at position 3 in ""crane"" and was wrong, but now we know A is at position 2, which is consistent.
- N was at position 4 in ""crane"" and was wrong, but now we know N is at position 1.

Now, we know the word starts with ""NA"", and we have three more letters to find.

We also know that the remaining three letters must be from the unused letters, and we must avoid C, R, E, S, T, Y.

Moreover, we know from the first guess that the word contains at least one more letter that we haven't placed: in ""crane"", we had A and N present (but wrong positions), and the other letters (C,R,E) are absent. This doesn't give us more letters because we already accounted for A and N.

So, we have:
- Positions 1: N (fixed)
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Positions 3,4,5: unknown, but cannot be C,R,E,S,T,Y.

We need to think of common English words starting with ""NA"".

We must avoid: C, R, E, S, T, Y.

Common letters that might appear: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, etc.

We have only 4 guesses left (since two used).

A good strategy is to choose a word that tests common letters for the remaining positions.

Possible words starting with ""NA"":
- ""NAVAL"" - but contains V and L? And A appears twice? We don't know if duplicate letters are allowed. Also, we have A at position 2, so the A at position 4 would be extra. But we don't know if the word has two A's.
- ""NADIR"" - but R is forbidden.
- ""NAIVE"" - but E is forbidden.
- ""NAPPY"" - but Y is forbidden and P is new? But Y is out.
- ""NAILS"" - S is forbidden.
- ""NAKED"" - E is forbidden.
- ""NAMES"" - E and S are forbidden.
- ""NATAL"" - T is forbidden? T is forbidden because in guess 2, T was in ""nasty"" and got (x). Also, note that ""NATAL"" has T at position 3 which is forbidden.

We need to avoid T, as per guess 2.

So let's list words without the forbidden letters: avoid C, R, E, S, T, Y.

Some possibilities:
- ""NAGUA"" - not common, and we are limited to five letters? ""NAGUA"" is not standard.
- ""NABLA"" - B and L? Also, has A again.
- ""NAVEL"" - V and L? But E is forbidden. N A V E L -> E is excluded.
- ""NAVAL"" - V and L? This might work: N(1) A(2) V(3) A(4) L(5) -> but duplicate A? We don't know if duplicate A is allowed. And V and L are new.

We need to consider the possibilities.

Alternatively, without duplicates? But we don't have any duplicate letters so far, but it's possible.

Another word: ""NAILS"" is out because of S.

""NADIR"" has R.

""NABOB"" - B and O? Also, has duplicate B? N A B O B -> but duplicates and O. This word is valid? Let me check: Yes, ""nabob"" is a word.

But we are trying to gather information. We could choose a word that tests common letters.

Since we know the first two letters are NA, we can try to use words that cover multiple common letters.

But note: we have positions 3,4,5 to guess.

We don't know any of these letters. Maybe we can choose a word that includes letters like I, O, L, B, D, etc.

Possible words:
- ""NABIS"" - but S is forbidden.
- ""NAIAD"" - A appears again? And I, D? But the word: N A I A D -> positions: 1:N, 2:A, 3:I, 4:A, 5:D. So duplicate A, which we aren't sure about.

To avoid duplication for now, we can assume there might be none? But we don't know.

Another word: ""NADAS"" - S forbidden.

Perhaps ""NAHAL"" - which has H, A, L? But duplicate A? N A H A L -> same issue.

Maybe ""NAIRA"" - R forbidden? ""NAIRA"" has R? N A I R A -> yes, R is at position 4, and R is forbidden.

Looking for words that avoid duplicates and forbidden letters.

Try ""NAVAL"" - but that has two A's.

In ""NAVAL"", the first A is at position 2 (which is correct) and the second A at position 4.

We were told A is in the word and in position 2 from guess 2, but we don't know if there is another A.

We might get feedback that would tell us.

But to be safe, it might be better to assume no duplicate until proven otherwise? We haven't had feedback indicating duplicates.

Another word: ""NAMED"" - E forbidden.

""NAFTA"" - F, T? T is forbidden (from guess 2). N A F T A -> T at position 4, and we know T is out.

So, forbidden letters include T.

What about ""NAGGY"" - Y forbidden.

""NAPPY"" - Y forbidden and P is new? But Y is forbidden.

Perhaps we need letters like O, L, P, B, D, G.

After filtering, let's consider:

Possible words starting with ""NA"" that do not contain C,R,E,S,T,Y and without duplicate for A? Or with duplicate? We might have to include duplicates.

Since we want to test if there is another A, but we can also test other letters.

But to maximize information, we can include a variety of letters.

One common word: ""NAIVE"" - forbidden E.

""NADIR"" - forbidden R.

""NALED"" - forbidden E.

""NAPAL"" - not a word.

""NAPPY"" - forbidden Y.

""NAVEL"" - forbidden E.

""NAIAD"" - forbidden? Letters: N,A,I,A,D -> forbidden letters? D is new, I is new. But duplicate A? So let's consider it: N A I A D.

We don't know if A appears twice.

But D and I are new. However, perhaps there is a better word.

Another idea: ""NAVEL"" is out.

What about ""NAILS"" - forbidden S.

Alternatively, ""NABOR"" - R forbidden.

""NAGOR"" - R forbidden.

""NABLA"" - B and L? N A B L A -> has duplicate A? Also, ""nabla"" is a word? Yes, but A at two positions.

We might not have many options without including the forbidden letters.

Let me think of common words: ""NATAL"" - forbidden T.

""NAOMI"" - O, M, I? N A O M I -> letters O, M, I are new. And no forbidden letters. But ""NAOMI"" is a name and might be accepted? We consider it valid.

Another: ""NABOB"" - N A B O B -> letters B, O. Also, the word is valid.

Or ""NAGAS"" - S forbidden.

We can also try ""NABIS"" - S forbidden.

Perhaps ""NAAPA"" - not a word.

Let's check ""NAPOL"" - not a word.

Alternatively, how about ""NADAS"" - S forbidden.

Given the constraints, I think we can try ""NABOB"" or ""NAOMI"".

But we have to be cautious. Another common word: ""NADIR"" is out.

Let me list:

- ""NAVEL"": forbidden E.
- ""NAVAL"": possible if we allow duplicates. But we can test V and L? Also, V is less common.
- ""NAIRA"": forbidden R.
- ""NAIVE"": forbidden E.
- ""NANDU"" - U? N A N D U -> has duplicate N? But we know N is at position 1, so another N would be possible? But in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was wrong, and in the second guess, N at position 1 is correct. But we don't know whether there is another N.

In ""NANDU"": N(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), U(5). So duplicate N.

But note: the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't have information.

We can try words without duplicates first to simplify.

Possible without duplicates and without forbidden letters:

Letters available: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,U,V,W,Z (and possibly others)

Common combinations:

- ""NAVAL"" has duplicate A? So invalid for no dup.
- ""NADIR"" has R -> out.
- ""NAIAD"" has duplicate A -> out.
- ""NABOB"" has duplicate B -> out.
- ""NAOMI"": N A O M I -> unique letters: O, M, I. All new. No duplicates. No forbidden letters.

Is ""NAOMI"" a word? Yes, a name and accepted as a word. For Wordle, names are sometimes accepted? But note: the game rules say ""valid 5-letter English word"", so we have to be careful.

Another word: ""NAPPY"" forbidden Y.

""NAGGY"" forbidden Y.

""NABES"" forbidden S and E.

""NAPPE"" forbidden E.

""NABOK"" not a word.

Another common word: ""NAVAR"" forbidden R.

Or ""NAVAR"" doesn't exist? 

Perhaps ""NAVEL"": out.

Let's consider ""NAHAL"" - not common, but accepted? Has duplicate A? N A H A L.

Duplicate A.

Perhaps ""NAFFA"" - not a word.

I think ""NAOMI"" is acceptable.

But let's confirm: In Wordle, ""NAOMI"" is used.

Alternatively, ""NABOB"" has duplicates? It has two B's, but those can be at different positions.

But we are testing multiple new letters.

Another word: ""NALLA"" - not common and duplicate L? N A L L A -> duplicates.

Perhaps we use ""NAGLF"" - not a word.

What about ""NAIKS"": S forbidden.

So, given the constraints, ""NAOMI"" seems reasonable.

Structuring the guess: ""NAOMI"" -> letters: N, A, O, M, I.

N is first (should be correct), A second (correct), then O at 3, M at 4, I at 5.

This tests O, M, and I in positions 3,4,5.

If the secret word does not have O, M, or I, we will know.

We have 4 guesses left, so it's okay.

Another possibility: ""NAPALM"" - that's 6 letters.

Too long.

""NADA"" - too short.

So, using ""NAOMI"" to test common vowels (O and I) and M.

Alternatively, ""NAMMA"" - duplicate M? Not common.

I'll go with ""NAOMI"".

But note: we are testing an 'O' and 'I' which are vowels.

We can also consider a word like ""NAGOR"" -> forbidden R.

No.

""NAVAR"" forbidden.

So, we choose ""NAOMI"".

Therefore, the third guess is ""NAOMI"".

<guess>naomi</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- From Guess 1 (""crane""): We know the secret word contains **A** and **N**, but not at positions 3 and 4 respectively. Letters **C**, **R**, and **E** are excluded.
- From Guess 2 (""nasty""): We know the first letter is **N** (✓), the second letter is **A** (✓), and letters **S**, **T**, and **Y** are excluded.

This means:
- The secret word starts with ""NA"".
- Positions 3–5 are unknown, but must consist of letters not in {C, R, E, S, T, Y}.
- No duplicates have been indicated yet, but they are possible.

For the third guess, I chose ""NAOMI"" because:
- It confirms the known ""NA"" start.
- It tests three new, common vowels/consonants (**O**, **M**, **I**) in positions 3–5 without forbidden letters.
- It leverages common English word patterns to maximize feedback coverage.",Guess 3: naomi -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) A(✓) O(x) M(x) I(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,NAVAL,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
N: - (in the word but wrong position)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". In ""crane"", A was at position 3 and N at position 4 (using 1-indexing: positions 1,2,3,4,5). Therefore, A cannot be at position 3 and N cannot be at position 4.
- The letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes A and N (since they are present in the word) but not at positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Excludes C, R, E.

Additionally, we don't know the positions of A and N. We also don't know what other letters are in the word.

We need to pick a word that uses other common letters to gather more information.

Common letters in English 5-letter words (besides the ones we've tried) might include: T, O, I, S, L, etc.

We also note that the word must have A and N, so we can try to form a word that has A and N in new positions.

Possible positions for A: since it was at position 3 in the first guess, it cannot be at position 3. So A can be at positions 1,2,4,5.
Similarly, N was at position 4, so it cannot be at position 4. So N can be at positions 1,2,3,5.

We also want to avoid C, R, E.

Let's think of words that have A and N, and use other common letters.

For example, we can try words like:
- ""PLANT"": but note that we have to avoid R and E? Actually, we don't have to avoid P, L, T. But let's check: 
  P, L, A, N, T. 
  However, we don't know if P, L, T are in the word. Also, in ""plant"", A is at position 3? Wait, in ""plant"": 
  P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). 
  But in our feedback, A was at position 3 and we were told it's in the word but wrong position. So A cannot be at position 3. Similarly, N was at position 4 and cannot be at position 4. 
  In ""plant"", A is at 3 and N at 4, which are the forbidden positions. So we cannot use ""plant"" because it puts A and N in the same positions we already know are wrong.

We need a word that has A and N in different positions.

Another idea: ""SANDY"" -> S, A, N, D, Y. 
Positions: A at 2, N at 3. 
But we don't know if S, D, Y are allowed? We haven't ruled them out. 
Also, note that in the first guess, A was at 3 and now we put it at 2, which is allowed. N was at 4 and now we put it at 3, which is also allowed (since the feedback only said N was not at 4, but 3 is new). 
But wait, we have to avoid R and E? Yes, but S, D, Y are not R or E. 

However, we must also consider that we have two letters we know are in the word: A and N. We want to test other letters too. 

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and N and also includes other common letters we haven't tried. 

Another common starting word is ""AUDIO"", but that has A at position 1 and we don't have N. We need to include N.

Let me think of words with A and N that are not in positions 3 and 4.

Possible words:
- ""MANGO"": M, A, N, G, O. 
  Positions: A at 2, N at 3. 
  But we don't know if M, G, O are in the word. Also, we avoid C, R, E. 
  However, note that in the first guess, we had A at 3 and now we put it at 2 -> allowed. N was at 4 and now at 3 -> allowed. 
  But we are using M, G, O which are new.

- ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T. 
  Positions: A at 2, N at 4? Wait: P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). 
  But we cannot have N at position 4 because in the first guess N was at 4 and we were told it's in the word but wrong position. So N cannot be at 4. Therefore, ""paint"" is invalid because it puts N at 4.

- ""TANGY"": T, A, N, G, Y. 
  Positions: A at 2, N at 3. 
  This avoids the forbidden positions: A not at 3, N not at 4. 
  And we use T, G, Y which are new.

- ""SNAIL"": S, N, A, I, L. 
  Positions: N at 2, A at 3. 
  But A at 3 is forbidden (from first feedback: A was at 3 and it was wrong position). So we cannot put A at 3. Therefore, ""snail"" is invalid.

- ""NASTY"": N, A, S, T, Y. 
  Positions: N at 1, A at 2. 
  This is good because A is not at 3 and N is not at 4. 
  Also, we test S, T, Y.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn't indicate any duplicates so far, but we don't know.

We can choose ""NASTY"". Let me check if it's a valid word: yes.

Alternatively, we can choose ""MANGO"", but I think ""NASTY"" is a good choice because it puts N at position 1 (which we haven't tested) and A at 2 (also new). 

But note: we are also testing S, T, Y. 

Another option: ""DAISY"" but that doesn't have N. We must include both A and N because we know they are in the word.

So, I think ""NASTY"" is a good candidate.

But wait: in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and it was present but wrong position. Now in ""NASTY"", A is at position 2. Similarly, N is at position 1 (previously at 4). 

We are also avoiding C, R, E.

So, let's go with ""NASTY"".

But note: we are using the letter S. We don't know if S is in the word. Similarly, T and Y.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has A and N and also includes letters that are common and we haven't tried. 

Another word: ""LATIN"" -> L, A, T, I, N. 
Positions: A at 2, N at 5. 
This is good because A is not at 3 and N is not at 4. 
But we are using L, T, I. 

However, we don't have information about I. 

But note: we are trying to maximize information. 

I think both ""NASTY"" and ""LATIN"" are reasonable. 

But let me consider: we have two known letters (A and N) and we want to test three new ones. 

In ""NASTY"", we are testing N at position 1, A at 2, and then S, T, Y. 

In ""LATIN"", we are testing A at 2, T at 3, I at 4, N at 5. 

We might get more information from ""NASTY"" because we are testing N at a new position (1) and A at 2, and then three new letters. 

But note: we are also testing the position of A and N. 

Alternatively, we can try to put A in a position we haven't tried, like position 1? 

For example: ""ANKLE"" but E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). 

""ANVIL"": A, N, V, I, L. 
Positions: A at 1, N at 2. 
But we avoid E, but V and I and L are new. 

But we don't know if V is common. 

I think ""NASTY"" is a good choice. 

Let me check the frequency of letters: 
Common consonants: S, T, L, N, R (but R is out), D, M, etc. 
Vowels: A, E (out), I, O, U.

We have A already. We might want to test other vowels? 

But we have two vowels: A and we don't know the others. 

We can try a word with A and another vowel. 

But we must include N. 

So, ""NASTY"" has A and the rest are consonants. 

Another word: ""OASIS"" but that doesn't have N and has duplicate S. 

We need N. 

""CANAL"" but C is out. 

""MANIA"": M, A, N, I, A -> duplicate A? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. 
Also, positions: A at 2 and 5. But we are not sure. 
And we avoid C, R, E. 
But in ""MANIA"", A is at position 2 and 5. We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. 
Also, N is at position 3. But we don't have feedback about N at 3. Previously N was at 4 and that was wrong. 
But we are allowed to put N at 3. 

However, we are using M and I. 

But I think it's better to avoid duplicates for now because we don't have evidence of duplicates. 

So, I'll go with ""NASTY"". 

Therefore, my second guess is ""NASTY"".

We'll write it as: <guess>nasty</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").
- **N** is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include **A** and **N** (since they are confirmed present), but avoid placing A at position 3 or N at position 4.
- It must exclude **C, R, E** entirely.
- To maximize information, I chose a word with common unused letters (S, T, Y) and repositioned A and N to untested slots (A at position 2, N at position 1).

""NASTY"" fits these criteria:
- N is at position 1 (new position, not 4).
- A is at position 2 (new position, not 3).
- S, T, Y are new letters to test.
- It avoids C, R, E.

<guess>nasty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: nasty -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) A(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C(x): C is not in the word.
- R(x): R is not in the word.
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(-): N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

Second guess: ""nasty""
- N(✓): N is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- A(✓): A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- T(x): T is not in the word.
- Y(x): Y is not in the word.

So, from this we know:
- The first letter is N.
- The second letter is A.
- Therefore, the secret word starts with ""NA"".
- The letters C, R, E, S, T, Y are not in the word at all.
- Also, we know that N is at position 1 (so it cannot be elsewhere), and A is at position 2 (so it cannot be elsewhere).

We also have the information from the first guess:
- A was at position 3 in ""crane"" and was wrong, but now we know A is at position 2, which is consistent.
- N was at position 4 in ""crane"" and was wrong, but now we know N is at position 1.

Now, we know the word starts with ""NA"", and we have three more letters to find.

We also know that the remaining three letters must be from the unused letters, and we must avoid C, R, E, S, T, Y.

Moreover, we know from the first guess that the word contains at least one more letter that we haven't placed: in ""crane"", we had A and N present (but wrong positions), and the other letters (C,R,E) are absent. This doesn't give us more letters because we already accounted for A and N.

So, we have:
- Positions 1: N (fixed)
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Positions 3,4,5: unknown, but cannot be C,R,E,S,T,Y.

We need to think of common English words starting with ""NA"".

We must avoid: C, R, E, S, T, Y.

Common letters that might appear: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, etc.

We have only 4 guesses left (since two used).

A good strategy is to choose a word that tests common letters for the remaining positions.

Possible words starting with ""NA"":
- ""NAVAL"" - but contains V and L? And A appears twice? We don't know if duplicate letters are allowed. Also, we have A at position 2, so the A at position 4 would be extra. But we don't know if the word has two A's.
- ""NADIR"" - but R is forbidden.
- ""NAIVE"" - but E is forbidden.
- ""NAPPY"" - but Y is forbidden and P is new? But Y is out.
- ""NAILS"" - S is forbidden.
- ""NAKED"" - E is forbidden.
- ""NAMES"" - E and S are forbidden.
- ""NATAL"" - T is forbidden? T is forbidden because in guess 2, T was in ""nasty"" and got (x). Also, note that ""NATAL"" has T at position 3 which is forbidden.

We need to avoid T, as per guess 2.

So let's list words without the forbidden letters: avoid C, R, E, S, T, Y.

Some possibilities:
- ""NAGUA"" - not common, and we are limited to five letters? ""NAGUA"" is not standard.
- ""NABLA"" - B and L? Also, has A again.
- ""NAVEL"" - V and L? But E is forbidden. N A V E L -> E is excluded.
- ""NAVAL"" - V and L? This might work: N(1) A(2) V(3) A(4) L(5) -> but duplicate A? We don't know if duplicate A is allowed. And V and L are new.

We need to consider the possibilities.

Alternatively, without duplicates? But we don't have any duplicate letters so far, but it's possible.

Another word: ""NAILS"" is out because of S.

""NADIR"" has R.

""NABOB"" - B and O? Also, has duplicate B? N A B O B -> but duplicates and O. This word is valid? Let me check: Yes, ""nabob"" is a word.

But we are trying to gather information. We could choose a word that tests common letters.

Since we know the first two letters are NA, we can try to use words that cover multiple common letters.

But note: we have positions 3,4,5 to guess.

We don't know any of these letters. Maybe we can choose a word that includes letters like I, O, L, B, D, etc.

Possible words:
- ""NABIS"" - but S is forbidden.
- ""NAIAD"" - A appears again? And I, D? But the word: N A I A D -> positions: 1:N, 2:A, 3:I, 4:A, 5:D. So duplicate A, which we aren't sure about.

To avoid duplication for now, we can assume there might be none? But we don't know.

Another word: ""NADAS"" - S forbidden.

Perhaps ""NAHAL"" - which has H, A, L? But duplicate A? N A H A L -> same issue.

Maybe ""NAIRA"" - R forbidden? ""NAIRA"" has R? N A I R A -> yes, R is at position 4, and R is forbidden.

Looking for words that avoid duplicates and forbidden letters.

Try ""NAVAL"" - but that has two A's.

In ""NAVAL"", the first A is at position 2 (which is correct) and the second A at position 4.

We were told A is in the word and in position 2 from guess 2, but we don't know if there is another A.

We might get feedback that would tell us.

But to be safe, it might be better to assume no duplicate until proven otherwise? We haven't had feedback indicating duplicates.

Another word: ""NAMED"" - E forbidden.

""NAFTA"" - F, T? T is forbidden (from guess 2). N A F T A -> T at position 4, and we know T is out.

So, forbidden letters include T.

What about ""NAGGY"" - Y forbidden.

""NAPPY"" - Y forbidden and P is new? But Y is forbidden.

Perhaps we need letters like O, L, P, B, D, G.

After filtering, let's consider:

Possible words starting with ""NA"" that do not contain C,R,E,S,T,Y and without duplicate for A? Or with duplicate? We might have to include duplicates.

Since we want to test if there is another A, but we can also test other letters.

But to maximize information, we can include a variety of letters.

One common word: ""NAIVE"" - forbidden E.

""NADIR"" - forbidden R.

""NALED"" - forbidden E.

""NAPAL"" - not a word.

""NAPPY"" - forbidden Y.

""NAVEL"" - forbidden E.

""NAIAD"" - forbidden? Letters: N,A,I,A,D -> forbidden letters? D is new, I is new. But duplicate A? So let's consider it: N A I A D.

We don't know if A appears twice.

But D and I are new. However, perhaps there is a better word.

Another idea: ""NAVEL"" is out.

What about ""NAILS"" - forbidden S.

Alternatively, ""NABOR"" - R forbidden.

""NAGOR"" - R forbidden.

""NABLA"" - B and L? N A B L A -> has duplicate A? Also, ""nabla"" is a word? Yes, but A at two positions.

We might not have many options without including the forbidden letters.

Let me think of common words: ""NATAL"" - forbidden T.

""NAOMI"" - O, M, I? N A O M I -> letters O, M, I are new. And no forbidden letters. But ""NAOMI"" is a name and might be accepted? We consider it valid.

Another: ""NABOB"" - N A B O B -> letters B, O. Also, the word is valid.

Or ""NAGAS"" - S forbidden.

We can also try ""NABIS"" - S forbidden.

Perhaps ""NAAPA"" - not a word.

Let's check ""NAPOL"" - not a word.

Alternatively, how about ""NADAS"" - S forbidden.

Given the constraints, I think we can try ""NABOB"" or ""NAOMI"".

But we have to be cautious. Another common word: ""NADIR"" is out.

Let me list:

- ""NAVEL"": forbidden E.
- ""NAVAL"": possible if we allow duplicates. But we can test V and L? Also, V is less common.
- ""NAIRA"": forbidden R.
- ""NAIVE"": forbidden E.
- ""NANDU"" - U? N A N D U -> has duplicate N? But we know N is at position 1, so another N would be possible? But in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was wrong, and in the second guess, N at position 1 is correct. But we don't know whether there is another N.

In ""NANDU"": N(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), U(5). So duplicate N.

But note: the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't have information.

We can try words without duplicates first to simplify.

Possible without duplicates and without forbidden letters:

Letters available: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,U,V,W,Z (and possibly others)

Common combinations:

- ""NAVAL"" has duplicate A? So invalid for no dup.
- ""NADIR"" has R -> out.
- ""NAIAD"" has duplicate A -> out.
- ""NABOB"" has duplicate B -> out.
- ""NAOMI"": N A O M I -> unique letters: O, M, I. All new. No duplicates. No forbidden letters.

Is ""NAOMI"" a word? Yes, a name and accepted as a word. For Wordle, names are sometimes accepted? But note: the game rules say ""valid 5-letter English word"", so we have to be careful.

Another word: ""NAPPY"" forbidden Y.

""NAGGY"" forbidden Y.

""NABES"" forbidden S and E.

""NAPPE"" forbidden E.

""NABOK"" not a word.

Another common word: ""NAVAR"" forbidden R.

Or ""NAVAR"" doesn't exist? 

Perhaps ""NAVEL"": out.

Let's consider ""NAHAL"" - not common, but accepted? Has duplicate A? N A H A L.

Duplicate A.

Perhaps ""NAFFA"" - not a word.

I think ""NAOMI"" is acceptable.

But let's confirm: In Wordle, ""NAOMI"" is used.

Alternatively, ""NABOB"" has duplicates? It has two B's, but those can be at different positions.

But we are testing multiple new letters.

Another word: ""NALLA"" - not common and duplicate L? N A L L A -> duplicates.

Perhaps we use ""NAGLF"" - not a word.

What about ""NAIKS"": S forbidden.

So, given the constraints, ""NAOMI"" seems reasonable.

Structuring the guess: ""NAOMI"" -> letters: N, A, O, M, I.

N is first (should be correct), A second (correct), then O at 3, M at 4, I at 5.

This tests O, M, and I in positions 3,4,5.

If the secret word does not have O, M, or I, we will know.

We have 4 guesses left, so it's okay.

Another possibility: ""NAPALM"" - that's 6 letters.

Too long.

""NADA"" - too short.

So, using ""NAOMI"" to test common vowels (O and I) and M.

Alternatively, ""NAMMA"" - duplicate M? Not common.

I'll go with ""NAOMI"".

But note: we are testing an 'O' and 'I' which are vowels.

We can also consider a word like ""NAGOR"" -> forbidden R.

No.

""NAVAR"" forbidden.

So, we choose ""NAOMI"".

Therefore, the third guess is ""NAOMI"".

<guess>naomi</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- From Guess 1 (""crane""): We know the secret word contains **A** and **N**, but not at positions 3 and 4 respectively. Letters **C**, **R**, and **E** are excluded.
- From Guess 2 (""nasty""): We know the first letter is **N** (✓), the second letter is **A** (✓), and letters **S**, **T**, and **Y** are excluded.

This means:
- The secret word starts with ""NA"".
- Positions 3–5 are unknown, but must consist of letters not in {C, R, E, S, T, Y}.
- No duplicates have been indicated yet, but they are possible.

For the third guess, I chose ""NAOMI"" because:
- It confirms the known ""NA"" start.
- It tests three new, common vowels/consonants (**O**, **M**, **I**) in positions 3–5 without forbidden letters.
- It leverages common English word patterns to maximize feedback coverage.

So N can be at positions 1,2,3,5.\n\nWe also want to avoid C, R, E.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have A and N, and use other common letters.\n\nFor example, we can try words like:\n- ""PLANT"": but note that we have to avoid R and E? Actually, we don\'t have to avoid P, L, T. But let\'s check: \n  P, L, A, N, T. \n  However, we don\'t know if P, L, T are in the word. Also, in ""plant"", A is at position 3? Wait, in ""plant"": \n  P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). \n  But in our feedback, A was at position 3 and we were told it\'s in the word but wrong position. So A cannot be at position 3. Similarly, N was at position 4 and cannot be at position 4. \n  In ""plant"", A is at 3 and N at 4, which are the forbidden positions. So we cannot use ""plant"" because it puts A and N in the same positions we already know are wrong.\n\nWe need a word that has A and N in different positions.\n\nAnother idea: ""SANDY"" -> S, A, N, D, Y. \nPositions: A at 2, N at 3. \nBut we don\'t know if S, D, Y are allowed? We haven\'t ruled them out. \nAlso, note that in the first guess, A was at 3 and now we put it at 2, which is allowed. N was at 4 and now we put it at 3, which is also allowed (since the feedback only said N was not at 4, but 3 is new). \nBut wait, we have to avoid R and E? Yes, but S, D, Y are not R or E. \n\nHowever, we must also consider that we have two letters we know are in the word: A and N. We want to test other letters too. \n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has A and N and also includes other common letters we haven\'t tried. \n\nAnother common starting word is ""AUDIO"", but that has A at position 1 and we don\'t have N. We need to include N.\n\nLet me think of words with A and N that are not in positions 3 and 4.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""MANGO"": M, A, N, G, O. \n  Positions: A at 2, N at 3. \n  But we don\'t know if M, G, O are in the word. Also, we avoid C, R, E. \n  However, note that in the first guess, we had A at 3 and now we put it at 2 -> allowed. N was at 4 and now at 3 -> allowed. \n  But we are using M, G, O which are new.\n\n- ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T. \n  Positions: A at 2, N at 4? Wait: P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). \n  But we cannot have N at position 4 because in the first guess N was at 4 and we were told it\'s in the word but wrong position. So N cannot be at 4. Therefore, ""paint"" is invalid because it puts N at 4.\n\n- ""TANGY"": T, A, N, G, Y. \n  Positions: A at 2, N at 3. \n  This avoids the forbidden positions: A not at 3, N not at 4. \n  And we use T, G, Y which are new.\n\n- ""SNAIL"": S, N, A, I, L. \n  Positions: N at 2, A at 3. \n  But A at 3 is forbidden (from first feedback: A was at 3 and it was wrong position). So we cannot put A at 3. Therefore, ""snail"" is invalid.\n\n- ""NASTY"": N, A, S, T, Y. \n  Positions: N at 1, A at 2. \n  This is good because A is not at 3 and N is not at 4. \n  Also, we test S, T, Y.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn\'t indicate any duplicates so far, but we don\'t know.\n\nWe can choose ""NASTY"". Let me check if it\'s a valid word: yes.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose ""MANGO"", but I think ""NASTY"" is a good choice because it puts N at position 1 (which we haven\'t tested) and A at 2 (also new). \n\nBut note: we are also testing S, T, Y. \n\nAnother option: ""DAISY"" but that doesn\'t have N. We must include both A and N because we know they are in the word.\n\nSo, I think ""NASTY"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut wait: in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and it was present but wrong position. Now in ""NASTY"", A is at position 2. Similarly, N is at position 1 (previously at 4). \n\nWe are also avoiding C, R, E.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""NASTY"".\n\nBut note: we are using the letter S. We don\'t know if S is in the word. Similarly, T and Y.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use a word that has A and N and also includes letters that are common and we haven\'t tried. \n\nAnother word: ""LATIN"" -> L, A, T, I, N. \nPositions: A at 2, N at 5. \nThis is good because A is not at 3 and N is not at 4. \nBut we are using L, T, I. \n\nHowever, we don\'t have information about I. \n\nBut note: we are trying to maximize information. \n\nI think both ""NASTY"" and ""LATIN"" are reasonable. \n\nBut let me consider: we have two known letters (A and N) and we want to test three new ones. \n\nIn ""NASTY"", we are testing N at position 1, A at 2, and then S, T, Y. \n\nIn ""LATIN"", we are testing A at 2, T at 3, I at 4, N at 5. \n\nWe might get more information from ""NASTY"" because we are testing N at a new position (1) and A at 2, and then three new letters. \n\nBut note: we are also testing the position of A and N. \n\nAlternatively, we can try to put A in a position we haven\'t tried, like position 1? \n\nFor example: ""ANKLE"" but E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). \n\n""ANVIL"": A, N, V, I, L. \nPositions: A at 1, N at 2. \nBut we avoid E, but V and I and L are new. \n\nBut we don\'t know if V is common. \n\nI think ""NASTY"" is a good choice. \n\nLet me check the frequency of letters: \nCommon consonants: S, T, L, N, R (but R is out), D, M, etc. \nVowels: A, E (out), I, O, U.\n\nWe have A already. We might want to test other vowels? \n\nBut we have two vowels: A and we don\'t know the others. \n\nWe can try a word with A and another vowel. \n\nBut we must include N. \n\nSo, ""NASTY"" has A and the rest are consonants. \n\nAnother word: ""OASIS"" but that doesn\'t have N and has duplicate S. \n\nWe need N. \n\n""CANAL"" but C is out. \n\n""MANIA"": M, A, N, I, A -> duplicate A? But we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. \nAlso, positions: A at 2 and 5. But we are not sure. \nAnd we avoid C, R, E. \nBut in ""MANIA"", A is at position 2 and 5. We know A is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. \nAlso, N is at position 3. But we don\'t have feedback about N at 3. Previously N was at 4 and that was wrong. \nBut we are allowed to put N at 3. \n\nHowever, we are using M and I. \n\nBut I think it\'s better to avoid duplicates for now because we don\'t have evidence of duplicates. \n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""NASTY"". \n\nTherefore, my second guess is ""NASTY"".\n\nWe\'ll write it as: <guess>nasty</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, R, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").\n- **N** is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must include **A** and **N** (since they are confirmed present), but avoid placing A at position 3 or N at position 4.\n- It must exclude **C, R, E** entirely.\n- To maximize information, I chose a word with common unused letters (S, T, Y) and repositioned A and N to untested slots (A at position 2, N at position 1).\n\n""NASTY"" fits these criteria:\n- N is at position 1 (new position, not 4).\n- A is at position 2 (new position, not 3).\n- S, T, Y are new letters to test.\n- It avoids C, R, E.\n\n<guess>nasty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: nasty -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) A(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane""\n- C(x): C is not in the word.\n- R(x): R is not in the word.\n- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 3.\n- N(-): N is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E(x): E is not in the word.\n\nSecond guess: ""nasty""\n- N(✓): N is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).\n- A(✓): A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).\n- S(x): S is not in the word.\n- T(x): T is not in the word.\n- Y(x): Y is not in the word.\n\nSo, from this we know:\n- The first letter is N.\n- The second letter is A.\n- Therefore, the secret word starts with ""NA"".\n- The letters C, R, E, S, T, Y are not in the word at all.\n- Also, we know that N is at position 1 (so it cannot be elsewhere), and A is at position 2 (so it cannot be elsewhere).\n\nWe also have the information from the first guess:\n- A was at position 3 in ""crane"" and was wrong, but now we know A is at position 2, which is consistent.\n- N was at position 4 in ""crane"" and was wrong, but now we know N is at position 1.\n\nNow, we know the word starts with ""NA"", and we have three more letters to find.\n\nWe also know that the remaining three letters must be from the unused letters, and we must avoid C, R, E, S, T, Y.\n\nMoreover, we know from the first guess that the word contains at least one more letter that we haven\'t placed: in ""crane"", we had A and N present (but wrong positions), and the other letters (C,R,E) are absent.

""NAGUA"" is not standard.\n- ""NABLA"" - B and L? Also, has A again.\n- ""NAVEL"" - V and L? But E is forbidden. N A V E L -> E is excluded.\n- ""NAVAL"" - V and L? This might work: N(1) A(2) V(3) A(4) L(5) -> but duplicate A? We don\'t know if duplicate A is allowed. And V and L are new.\n\nWe need to consider the possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, without duplicates? But we don\'t have any duplicate letters so far, but it\'s possible.\n\nAnother word: ""NAILS"" is out because of S.\n\n""NADIR"" has R.\n\n""NABOB"" - B and O? Also, has duplicate B? N A B O B -> but duplicates and O. This word is valid? Let me check: Yes, ""nabob"" is a word.\n\nBut we are trying to gather information. We could choose a word that tests common letters.\n\nSince we know the first two letters are NA, we can try to use words that cover multiple common letters.\n\nBut note: we have positions 3,4,5 to guess.\n\nWe don\'t know any of these letters. Maybe we can choose a word that includes letters like I, O, L, B, D, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""NABIS"" - but S is forbidden.\n- ""NAIAD"" - A appears again? And I, D? But the word: N A I A D -> positions: 1:N, 2:A, 3:I, 4:A, 5:D. So duplicate A, which we aren\'t sure about.\n\nTo avoid duplication for now, we can assume there might be none? But we don\'t know.\n\nAnother word: ""NADAS"" - S forbidden.\n\nPerhaps ""NAHAL"" - which has H, A, L? But duplicate A? N A H A L -> same issue.\n\nMaybe ""NAIRA"" - R forbidden? ""NAIRA"" has R? N A I R A -> yes, R is at position 4, and R is forbidden.\n\nLooking for words that avoid duplicates and forbidden letters.\n\nTry ""NAVAL"" - but that has two A\'s.\n\nIn ""NAVAL"", the first A is at position 2 (which is correct) and the second A at position 4.\n\nWe were told A is in the word and in position 2 from guess 2, but we don\'t know if there is another A.\n\nWe might get feedback that would tell us.\n\nBut to be safe, it might be better to assume no duplicate until proven otherwise? We haven\'t had feedback indicating duplicates.\n\nAnother word: ""NAMED"" - E forbidden.\n\n""NAFTA"" - F, T? T is forbidden (from guess 2). N A F T A -> T at position 4, and we know T is out.\n\nSo, forbidden letters include T.\n\nWhat about ""NAGGY"" - Y forbidden.\n\n""NAPPY"" - Y forbidden and P is new? But Y is forbidden.\n\nPerhaps we need letters like O, L, P, B, D, G.\n\nAfter filtering, let\'s consider:\n\nPossible words starting with ""NA"" that do not contain C,R,E,S,T,Y and without duplicate for A? Or with duplicate? We might have to include duplicates.\n\nSince we want to test if there is another A, but we can also test other letters.\n\nBut to maximize information, we can include a variety of letters.\n\nOne common word: ""NAIVE"" - forbidden E.\n\n""NADIR"" - forbidden R.\n\n""NALED"" - forbidden E.\n\n""NAPAL"" - not a word.\n\n""NAPPY"" - forbidden Y.\n\n""NAVEL"" - forbidden E.\n\n""NAIAD"" - forbidden? Letters: N,A,I,A,D -> forbidden letters? D is new, I is new. But duplicate A? So let\'s consider it: N A I A D.\n\nWe don\'t know if A appears twice.\n\nBut D and I are new. However, perhaps there is a better word.\n\nAnother idea: ""NAVEL"" is out.\n\nWhat about ""NAILS"" - forbidden S.\n\nAlternatively, ""NABOR"" - R forbidden.\n\n""NAGOR"" - R forbidden.\n\n""NABLA"" - B and L? N A B L A -> has duplicate A? Also, ""nabla"" is a word? Yes, but A at two positions.\n\nWe might not have many options without including the forbidden letters.\n\nLet me think of common words: ""NATAL"" - forbidden T.\n\n""NAOMI"" - O, M, I? N A O M I -> letters O, M, I are new. And no forbidden letters. But ""NAOMI"" is a name and might be accepted? We consider it valid.\n\nAnother: ""NABOB"" - N A B O B -> letters B, O. Also, the word is valid.\n\nOr ""NAGAS"" - S forbidden.\n\nWe can also try ""NABIS"" - S forbidden.\n\nPerhaps ""NAAPA"" - not a word.\n\nLet\'s check ""NAPOL"" - not a word.\n\nAlternatively, how about ""NADAS"" - S forbidden.\n\nGiven the constraints, I think we can try ""NABOB"" or ""NAOMI"".\n\nBut we have to be cautious. Another common word: ""NADIR"" is out.\n\nLet me list:\n\n- ""NAVEL"": forbidden E.\n- ""NAVAL"": possible if we allow duplicates. But we can test V and L? Also, V is less common.\n- ""NAIRA"": forbidden R.\n- ""NAIVE"": forbidden E.\n- ""NANDU"" - U? N A N D U -> has duplicate N? But we know N is at position 1, so another N would be possible? But in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was wrong, and in the second guess, N at position 1 is correct. But we don\'t know whether there is another N.\n\nIn ""NANDU"": N(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), U(5). So duplicate N.\n\nBut note: the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t have information.\n\nWe can try words without duplicates first to simplify.\n\nPossible without duplicates and without forbidden letters:\n\nLetters available: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,U,V,W,Z (and possibly others)\n\nCommon combinations:\n\n- ""NAVAL"" has duplicate A? So invalid for no dup.\n- ""NADIR"" has R -> out.\n- ""NAIAD"" has duplicate A -> out.\n- ""NABOB"" has duplicate B -> out.\n- ""NAOMI"": N A O M I -> unique letters: O, M, I. All new. No duplicates. No forbidden letters.\n\nIs ""NAOMI"" a word? Yes, a name and accepted as a word. For Wordle, names are sometimes accepted? But note: the game rules say ""valid 5-letter English word"", so we have to be careful.\n\nAnother word: ""NAPPY"" forbidden Y.\n\n""NAGGY"" forbidden Y.\n\n""NABES"" forbidden S and E.\n\n""NAPPE"" forbidden E.\n\n""NABOK"" not a word.\n\nAnother common word: ""NAVAR"" forbidden R.\n\nOr ""NAVAR"" doesn\'t exist? \n\nPerhaps ""NAVEL"": out.\n\nLet\'s consider ""NAHAL"" - not common, but accepted? Has duplicate A? N A H A L.\n\nDuplicate A.\n\nPerhaps ""NAFFA"" - not a word.\n\nI think ""NAOMI"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: In Wordle, ""NAOMI"" is used.\n\nAlternatively, ""NABOB"" has duplicates? It has two B\'s, but those can be at different positions.\n\nBut we are testing multiple new letters.\n\nAnother word: ""NALLA"" - not common and duplicate L? N A L L A -> duplicates.\n\nPerhaps we use ""NAGLF"" - not a word.\n\nWhat about ""NAIKS"": S forbidden.\n\nSo, given the constraints, ""NAOMI"" seems reasonable.\n\nStructuring the guess: ""NAOMI"" -> letters: N, A, O, M, I.\n\nN is first (should be correct), A second (correct), then O at 3, M at 4, I at 5.\n\nThis tests O, M, and I in positions 3,4,5.\n\nIf the secret word does not have O, M, or I, we will know.\n\nWe have 4 guesses left, so it\'s okay.\n\nAnother possibility: ""NAPALM"" - that\'s 6 letters.\n\nToo long.\n\n""NADA"" - too short.\n\nSo, using ""NAOMI"" to test common vowels (O and I) and M.\n\nAlternatively, ""NAMMA"" - duplicate M? Not common.\n\nI\'ll go with ""NAOMI"".\n\nBut note: we are testing an \'O\' and \'I\' which are vowels.\n\nWe can also consider a word like ""NAGOR"" -> forbidden R.\n\nNo.\n\n""NAVAR"" forbidden.\n\nSo, we choose ""NAOMI"".\n\nTherefore, the third guess is ""NAOMI"".\n\n<guess>naomi</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- From Guess 1 (""crane""): We know the secret word contains **A** and **N**, but not at positions 3 and 4 respectively. Letters **C**, **R**, and **E** are excluded.\n- From Guess 2 (""nasty""): We know the first letter is **N** (✓), the second letter is **A** (✓), and letters **S**, **T**, and **Y** are excluded.\n\nThis means:\n- The secret word starts with ""NA"".\n- Positions 3–5 are unknown, but must consist of letters not in {C, R, E, S, T, Y}.\n- No duplicates have been indicated yet, but they are possible.\n\nFor the third guess, I chose ""NAOMI"" because:\n- It confirms the known ""NA"" start.\n- It tests three new, common vowels/consonants (**O**, **M**, **I**) in positions 3–5 without forbidden letters.\n- It leverages common English word patterns to maximize feedback coverage.\n\n<guess>naomi</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: nasty -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) A(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: naomi -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) A(✓) O(x) M(x) I(x)\n'}]","<think>
Okay, let's tackle this step by step. We've got the feedback from three guesses now:

First, with ""crane"": 
- C wasn't in the word at all, same with R and E. 
- A and N are in the word, but not in positions 3 and 4.

Then ""nasty"":
- N and A are exactly right at positions 1 and 2!
- S, T, and Y aren't in the word.

And latest guess ""naomi"":
- First two letters N and A confirmed again - still correct.
- O, M, and I aren't in the word at all.

So putting it all together:
- The word definitely starts with ""NA"" since both guesses 2 and 3 confirmed this.
- We've ruled out many letters now: C, R, E, S, T, Y, O, M, I aren't in the secret word at all.
- Positions 3-5 need letters not from these forbidden ones.

Forbidden letters so far: C, E, R, S, T, Y, O, M, I (that leaves fewer options!)

Possible letters for positions 3-5: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, Z etc. But common ones would be preferable.

Words I might try:
- ""NAP"" words? But T is forbidden, so ""nappy"" excluded due to Y and T issues.
- ""NAG"" something? Like ""naggy"" but Y forbidden.
- ""NAB"" possible? Like ""nabob"" but in guess 3 M and I weren't present - ""nabob"" has O? Wait no: N A B O B - but O was ruled out in the last guess! O is not allowed. 

Important: in ""naomi"", O was position 3 which got (x), meaning O is entirely absent. So ""nabob"" would have O? Yes - O at position 4? So ""nabob"": N(1) A(2) B(3) O(4) B(5) - O forbidden -> invalid.

Similarly, ""naval"" has A twice? But would positions: first A correct, second A? Duplicate? We don't know. Also O not involved? ""Naval"" is N A V A L - letters V and L.

V and L haven't been tested yet.

So possible word: ""NAVAL"" - checks:
- No forbidden letters? V, L, A - A is already in position 2 though. But it has duplicate A at position 4.
- We'll get feedback on whether duplicate A exists.

Another possibility: ""NAVEL"" was excluded earlier because E is forbidden.

Or ""NADIR"" - R forbidden.

""NAG"" options - ""naggy"" has Y forbidden, ""nagua"" not real word.

Could be ""NAFTA"" - but T forbidden? N A F T A -> T at position 4? T was excluded in guess 2, so invalid.

Similar problem with ""natal"".

So what words starting NA use only allowed letters?
- Must avoid: C,E,R,S,T,Y,O,M,I

So working with: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,P,U,V,W,Z etc.

Consider:
- ""P"" is available -> could try ""NAPAL"" not word or something else?
- ""D"" -> ""nadir"" forbidden R.
- ""V"" -> ""naval"" is possible - letters V,A,L (A duplicate). Positions 3,4,5: V, A, L.
- ""L"" -> ""naled"" E forbidden.
- ""G"" -> ""nagor"" R forbidden.
- ""H"" -> ""nahum"" U? N A H U M -> M forbidden? In guess 3, M got (x) - entirely absent. So M not allowed. Thus ""nahum"" has M -> invalid.

Hmm. What about ""NAHAL""? But duplicate A? And L new. But N A H A L.

Duplicate A. 

Another word? ""NANDU"": N A N D U -> duplicate N? But we know N is already at position 1.

Duplicates? Possibly.

""NANDU"" would have letters: N(1),A(2),N(3),D(4),U(5). But N is already confirmed at start? Could have another N? But positions: N at 3? And D,U new.

But in guess 3, O,M,I excluded, so ""nandu"" has no forbidden letters? N,A,N,D,U - letters D,U new; forbidden ones not present.

Common word? ""Nandu"" is an animal? Valid Scrabble word, likely acceptable.

Similarly, ""NADPH"" too specialized? Probably not.

Consider ""NAPPY"" again but Y forbidden.

Perhaps ""NAVAL"" remains an option. Letters V,L.

I think ""Nandu"" might be risky? Less common.

Another thought: position 3 might be L? Possible?

What words: ""NAL"" something? Like ""naled"" E forbidden, ""nalgo"" not word.

Not many.

Consider position 3:
Could be B: ""nabob"" has O forbidden. 
D: ""nadir"" R forbidden.
F: ""nafis"" S forbidden? Or ""naff"" not five.
G: ""naggy"" Y forbidden.
K: ""nakka"" duplicate K? Or not common. Or ""naked"" E forbidden.

So narrowing down, perhaps ""V"" is our best bet - like ""naval"".

Or ""W"": ""nawab"" W? N A W A B -> letters W,B; duplicate A? But W new.

""Nawab"" is a valid word: meaning a governor. Letters N,A,W,A,B.

Avoids forbidden letters? Check: C,E,R,S,T,Y,O,M,I - none appear in ""nawab"". So W,A,B - only new letters W and B.

Positions: 3:W, 4:A(duplicate?), 5:B.

Could give good information.

Similarly, ""naval"" we have V and L.

Both seem plausible.

I think ""NAVAL"" is a bit more common? And shorter common words might be prioritized.

After checking, ""naval"" and ""nawab"" both valid. Think I'll choose ""naval"" to test V and L.

So guess ""NAVAL"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **N** is confirmed at position 1 (✓ from Guess 2 and Guess 3).
- **A** is confirmed at position 2 (✓ from Guess 2 and Guess 3).
- Letters **C, E, R, S, T, Y, O, M, I** are entirely absent from the word (marked ""x"" across guesses).
- The secret word starts with ""NA"", and positions 3–5 must consist of letters not in the excluded set {C, E, I, M, O, R, S, T, Y}.

Possible letters for positions 3–5 include: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, Z.

Given the constraints, ""NAVAL"" is a valid guess because:
- It tests new common letters **V** and **L** in positions 3 and 5.
- It probes for a possible duplicate **A** at position 4 (which hasn't been confirmed or ruled out).
- It avoids all excluded letters.
