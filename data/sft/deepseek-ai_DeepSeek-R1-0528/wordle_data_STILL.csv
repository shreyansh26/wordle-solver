We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think about the frequency of letters in English words. The most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc.
 We want a word that has 5 distinct letters to maximize information.

 I recall that ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning a roll of money or wealth) and it uses common letters. However, let me check if it's valid.
 Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is also a good one.

 But let me choose a word that has a good balance: ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. These are common letters.

 However, note that the game requires a valid 5-letter English word.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

 Since none of these letters are present, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think about the remaining letters. We have to form a valid English word.

 Common letters that are left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to maximize the information we get, so we should try to include common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 The most common letters in English (without the ones we've tried) might be: S, T, O, L, I, etc.

 Let's try to form a word with as many of these as possible.

 Some possibilities:
 - ""TOILS"": but we haven't tried T, O, I, L, S. However, note that we must avoid E, A, R, N, C.

 But wait, we haven't tried T, O, I, L, S. So that could be a candidate.

 However, we might also consider ""PIOUS"", but that has P, I, O, U, S. U is less common.

 Another common word: ""SLIMY"" - S, L, I, M, Y.

 But let's think of words that use the most common remaining letters.

 According to letter frequency, after removing C, R, A, N, E, the next most common are: T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 So a good candidate might be ""TOILS"" or ""STOIC"" but note that we cannot use C (from the first feedback). So ""STOIC"" is invalid because it has C.

 Another word: ""MOIST"" - M, O, I, S, T. This uses common letters and avoids the forbidden ones.

 Similarly, ""PILOT"" has P, I, L, O, T. But note that we haven't tried P, I, L, O, T.

 However, we must ensure the word is valid.

 Let me list a few options:
 1. ""MOIST"" - meaning slightly wet.
 2. ""PILOT"" - a person who operates an aircraft.
 3. ""BUOYS"" - but that has U and Y, which are less common, and also we haven't tried B, U, O, Y, S.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 The word ""MOIST"" has M, O, I, S, T. All of these are common.

 Alternatively, ""LUSTY"" - but that has L, U, S, T, Y. U and Y are less common.

 Another option: ""GHOUL"" - but that has G, H, O, U, L. U is less common and we might not get much information.

 Considering the above, I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it uses M, O, I, S, T, which are all common and we haven't tried them.

 So, let's go with ""MOIST"".

 But note: we must be cautious because the word must be valid. ""MOIST"" is a valid English word.

 Therefore, our next guess is ""MOIST"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), the secret word contains none of these letters. For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely and tests new common letters like S, T, O, I, L, or M to gather more information. 

After considering options like ""toils"" (which uses T, O, I, L, S) and ""pilot"" (P, I, L, O, T), I selected ""moist"" because it:
- Uses high-frequency letters (M, O, I, S, T) not yet tested
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E)
- Is a valid English word

This guess maximizes the chance of revealing correct letters/positions while covering new ground.

For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely and tests new common letters like S, T, O, I, L, or M to gather more information. \n\nAfter considering options like ""toils"" (which uses T, O, I, L, S) and ""pilot"" (P, I, L, O, T), I selected ""moist"" because it:\n- Uses high-frequency letters (M, O, I, S, T) not yet tested\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E)\n- Is a valid English word\n\nThis guess maximizes the chance of revealing correct letters/positions while covering new ground.\n\n<guess>moist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(✓) S(-) T(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So the secret word has none of these letters.

Guess 2: ""moist"" -> 
  M(x) -> absent
  O(x) -> absent
  I(✓) -> correct, meaning the letter I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since I is the third letter in ""moist"")
  S(-) -> present, meaning S is in the word but not in the fourth position (since in ""moist"", S is the fourth letter)
  T(-) -> present, meaning T is in the word but not in the fifth position (since in ""moist"", T is the fifth letter)

So from guess 2, we know:
- The third letter is I.
- The word contains S and T, but S is not in position 4 and T is not in position 5.

Also, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has I as the third letter (position 3).
- Contains S and T (but S not in position 4, T not in position 5).
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, E, M, O.

Additionally, we must avoid the positions we know for S and T: S cannot be in position 4, and T cannot be in position 5.

Let's list the available letters: 
We have 26 letters minus the ones we know are absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, O. So we avoid these 7 letters.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: I, S, T are in the word, but we must place them appropriately.

Constraints:
- Position 3 must be I.
- The word must contain S and T (each exactly once? We don't know for sure, but we'll assume no duplicates until we have evidence. The feedback doesn't show duplicates, so we assume the word has unique letters for now, but note that Wordle can have duplicate letters. However, in this feedback, we don't have any indication of duplicates so far. Since in ""moist"" we had one S and one T, and the feedback for S and T was present (but wrong position), it doesn't rule out duplicates, but without evidence, we might assume no duplicates for efficiency. But let's be cautious: the secret word might have duplicate letters. However, since we are avoiding many letters, we'll try to form a word without duplicates first.)

We know S is in the word but not in position 4. Similarly, T is in the word but not in position 5.

Possible positions for S: positions 1, 2, 5 (since position 3 is I and position 4 is forbidden for S, and position 4 is the only one we know S cannot be in). Similarly, T cannot be in position 5, so T can be in positions 1, 2, 4.

But note: the word has 5 positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

So:
- Position 3: fixed as I.
- S can be in: 1, 2, 5 (because not 4, and 3 is taken by I).
- T can be in: 1, 2, 4 (because not 5, and 3 is taken by I).

We also need two more letters for the remaining positions, which must be from the available letters and not S or T (if we assume no duplicates) or possibly duplicates? But without evidence, we avoid duplicates for now.

So the word structure: 
Positions: 
1: ? (can be S, T, or another letter)
2: ? (can be S, T, or another letter)
3: I (fixed)
4: ? (can be T or another letter, but not S)
5: ? (can be S or another letter, but not T)

We know the word must have at least one S and one T, so one of the positions must be S and one must be T.

We have two cases for S and T: they might be in different positions, and we have to assign them to the available spots.

Possible assignments for S and T:

Option 1: S in position 1, then T can be in 2 or 4.
Option 2: S in position 2, then T can be in 1 or 4.
Option 3: S in position 5, then T can be in 1, 2, or 4.

But note: we have two more positions to fill (if we assign S and T to two positions, then the remaining two positions must be filled with two other letters).

We need to form a valid English word.

Let's think of words that have I in the third position and contain S and T.

We can list possible words:

- If S is in position 1: then the word starts with S, then the second letter is ?, then I, then ? (which can be T or another letter), and then ? (which can be another letter, but not T because T cannot be in position 5? Actually, T cannot be in position 5, so if S is in 1, then T must be in 2 or 4.

Example: 
  S _ I _ _
  If T is in 2: then S T I _ _ -> we need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. But position 5 cannot be T (already used and T is only one for now) and T is already in 2. So positions 4 and 5 must be two other letters. Words: ? 
  Possibilities: STI?? -> e.g., STILL (but L is available, but note we have I in position 3 and L in 4 and 5? But STILL has two L's. Also, we have to avoid E, A, etc. STILL: S, T, I, L, L. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to check if L is allowed? Yes, L is available. But the word has duplicate L's? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, but it's possible. However, let's see: if we guess STILL, then the feedback for the first S: we know S is present and in the correct position? But we don't know if the word has two S's? Actually, in STILL, there is only one S. But we have two L's. The secret word might have duplicate letters. But without evidence, we might avoid. Also, note that in STILL, the T is in position 2, which is allowed. But the feedback for T in ""moist"" was present but not in position 5, so it could be in 2. However, we must check if STILL is allowed? But STILL has two L's, and we don't know if that's the case. Also, we have to avoid the forbidden letters. STILL: S, T, I, L, L. The forbidden letters are C,R,A,N,E,M,O. L is not forbidden. So it's possible. But let's see if there are other words.

Alternatively, if S is in 1 and T in 4: then S _ I T _ -> we need the second and fifth letters. The fifth letter cannot be T (already used) and must be a letter that is not forbidden. So S ? I T ? -> words: SMITH (but M is forbidden, because in guess2 M was absent), so M cannot be used. Other words: SWIFT? W and F are available, but SWIFT: S, W, I, F, T -> but then T is in position 5? But T cannot be in position 5! Because in guess2, T was present but not in position 5, meaning in the secret word, T is not in position 5. So if we put T in position 5, that would be invalid. Therefore, we cannot have T in position 5. So in this case, if S is in 1 and T in 4, then the word is S ? I T ? and the fifth letter must not be T. But we already have T in position 4, so the fifth letter is something else. But the problem is that we have T in position 4, which is allowed (since T can be in 4). So words: 
  S ? I T ? 
  Examples: 
    SPITE: S, P, I, T, E -> but E is forbidden (from guess1). 
    SIGHT: S, I, G, H, T -> but wait, the third letter must be I, so S, ?, I, T, ? -> so the second letter must be between S and I. So S (letter2) I T (letter5). 
    So S?IT? -> the word must be of the form [S] [X] [I] [T] [Y]. 
    We need words that fit this pattern. 
    Possibilities: 
      SLITS: but that would be S, L, I, T, S -> but then we have two S's? And the last letter is S. But we are avoiding duplicates? Also, the fifth letter is S, which is allowed because S can be in position 5. But note: we already have S in position 1, so if the word has two S's, that's possible. But in the feedback for ""moist"", we had S marked as present (but wrong position) and we don't know if it was the only S. So duplicates are possible. 
      However, let's check: SLITS -> S in position 1 and 5. But we know that in the secret word, S is present and not in position 4, but it could be in 1 and 5? But we don't have evidence against duplicates. 
      But we must avoid forbidden letters. SLITS: S, L, I, T, S -> letters: S, L, I, T. All allowed? Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,M,O. So L, I, T, S are allowed. 
      But is SLITS a valid word? Yes, it is the plural of slit. 
      However, note that the third letter is I, which is fixed, and the fourth is T, which is allowed. 
      But we have T in position 4, which is allowed (since T cannot be in 5, but 4 is okay). 
      Also, S in position 1 and 5: that's two S's. 

  Another word: SHIFT: S, H, I, F, T -> but then the fourth letter is F and fifth is T. But we need T in the fourth position? No, in this pattern we are considering T in position 4. But in SHIFT, the T is in position 5, which is not allowed (because T cannot be in position 5). So SHIFT is invalid for this pattern because we are putting T in position 5.

  So back to S?IT? -> we need the fifth letter to be not T and not forbidden. 
  Examples: 
    SLIT: only 4 letters? We need 5.
    SPITS: S, P, I, T, S -> similar to SLITS, but with P. 
    SKITS: S, K, I, T, S -> also valid.

  But note: we have two S's in these words. 

Alternatively, if S is in position 2: 
  Then the word: _ S I _ _
  And T can be in position 1 or 4 (since T cannot be in 5, and position 3 is I).

  If T in 1: then T S I _ _ -> we need positions 4 and 5. 
    Example: TSID? -> not common. 
    TSADI? not a word. 
    TSARS: but then we have two S's? T, S, I, A, R -> but A and R are forbidden. 
    Not many common words.

  If T in 4: then _ S I T _ -> we need first and fifth letters. 
    Words: ? S I T ? 
    Examples: 
      VISIT: V, I, S, I, T -> but wait, the third letter is I, and we have I again? But in VISIT, the third letter is S? No: V-I-S-I-T -> positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T -> but we need the third letter to be I, so that doesn't match. 
      We need the pattern: [X] [S] [I] [T] [Y]
      So the word must have the second letter S, third I, fourth T. 
      Examples: 
        EXIST: E is forbidden.
        POSIT: P, O, S, I, T -> but O is forbidden (from guess2).
        DITSY: D, I, T, S, Y -> but that doesn't fit the pattern (we need second letter to be S, but in DITSY it's I in second).
        We need: ? S I T ? 
        Possibilities: 
          USUAL: doesn't fit.
          I can't think of many. Maybe ""SPITE"" but that is S in first, not second.

  This seems difficult. 

Now, the third option: S in position 5.
  Then the word: _ _ I _ S
  And T can be in 1, 2, or 4.

  If T in 1: T _ I _ S -> we need positions 2 and 4.
    Examples: T?I?S -> 
      TRAIS -> not a word.
      TWIGS: T, W, I, G, S -> that fits: T in 1, W in 2, I in 3, G in 4, S in 5. And W, G are allowed. 
      THIGS: not common.
      TRIPS: R and P? R is forbidden (from guess1). 
      So TWIGS is a possibility.

  If T in 2: _ T I _ S -> we need positions 1 and 4.
    Examples: ?T I ? S -> 
      UTILS: U, T, I, L, S -> fits: U in 1, T in 2, I in 3, L in 4, S in 5. 
      Also, UTILS is a valid word. 
      Other: STIRS: but S is in 5 and we have S in 1? But we are putting S in 5, so the first letter is not S. 
      Also, UTILS: U, T, I, L, S -> all letters allowed? U, T, I, L, S. Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,M,O. So U, T, I, L, S are all allowed.

  If T in 4: _ _ I T S -> we need positions 1 and 2.
    Examples: ? ? I T S -> 
      WAITS: W, A, I, T, S -> but A is forbidden.
      FRITS: F, R, I, T, S -> R forbidden.
      BLITS: B, L, I, T, S -> B and L allowed? Yes. BLITS is a word? It might be a variant of blitz? But blitz is 5 letters: B, L, I, T, Z -> not S. 
      So not many common words.

So from the above, we have a few candidate words:

1. From S in position 1 and T in position 2: STI?? -> but we need two more letters. We considered STILL (but duplicate L) and STING (but N is forbidden) and STICK (C forbidden). Actually, we didn't find a good one without forbidden letters? 

   Earlier I thought of STILL: S, T, I, L, L -> but duplicate L. But is that acceptable? The game allows duplicate letters. And we haven't ruled out L. So STILL is a candidate.

2. From S in position 1 and T in position 4: we had SLITS, SPITS, SKITS. 
   SLITS: S, L, I, T, S -> duplicate S. 
   SPITS: S, P, I, T, S -> duplicate S.
   SKITS: S, K, I, T, S -> duplicate S.

3. From S in position 5 and T in position 1: TWIGS: T, W, I, G, S -> no duplicates, and W, G are allowed.

4. From S in position 5 and T in position 2: UTILS: U, T, I, L, S -> no duplicates.

We also have the constraint that in the feedback for ""moist"", S was present but not in position 4, and T was present but not in position 5. 

In the candidate words:

- For STILL: 
  - S is in position 1 -> not 4, so okay.
  - T is in position 2 -> not 5, so okay.
  - But we have duplicate L? The secret word might have duplicate letters. We don't know.

- For SLITS (or SPITS, SKITS): 
  - S is in position 1 and 5 -> so one of the S's is in position 1 (which is not 4) and the other in 5 (which is not 4) so that's okay for S. 
  - T is in position 4 -> not 5, so okay.

- For TWIGS:
  - T is in position 1 -> not 5, okay.
  - S is in position 5 -> not 4, okay.

- For UTILS:
  - T is in position 2 -> not 5, okay.
  - S is in position 5 -> not 4, okay.

We need to choose one that is a valid word and tests new letters.

We also want to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.

Let's list the letters we have already tried: 
From guess1: C, R, A, N, E
From guess2: M, O, I, S, T

So we have tried: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T.

We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

In the candidates:

- STILL: uses S, T, I, L -> but we have already tried S, T, I, and L is new. So it only introduces one new letter (L) and we have duplicate L.

- SLITS: uses S, L, I, T -> same as above, but with duplicate S. Also, only one new letter L.

- TWIGS: uses T, W, I, G, S -> we have T, I, S already, and W and G are new. So two new letters.

- UTILS: uses U, T, I, L, S -> T, I, S already, and U and L are new. So two new letters.

So TWIGS and UTILS introduce two new letters each, which is better.

Between TWIGS and UTILS, which one to choose?

We can also consider other words that fit the pattern and introduce more new letters.

But let's see if there are words that use even more new letters? We have to fill the positions.

Another possibility: what if we put S in position 5 and T in position 4? Then we have _ _ I T S. We need two letters at the beginning. We thought of BLITS? But that might not be common. Other words: 
  DUITS -> not common.
  FRITS: F, R, I, T, S -> R forbidden.
  GRITS: G, R, I, T, S -> R forbidden.
  HITS: too short.
  QUITS: Q, U, I, T, S -> but we have I in third? QUITS: Q, U, I, T, S -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:T, 5:S -> that fits! And Q, U are new, and we avoid forbidden letters. 
  So QUITS: Q, U, I, T, S -> all allowed? Q, U, I, T, S. Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,M,O. So yes.

So QUITS is a candidate. It has:
- T in position 4 -> not 5, okay.
- S in position 5 -> not 4, okay.
- New letters: Q, U (and we already know I, T, S).

So it introduces two new letters: Q and U.

Now we have:
- TWIGS: T, W, I, G, S -> new letters: W, G
- UTILS: U, T, I, L, S -> new letters: U, L
- QUITS: Q, U, I, T, S -> new letters: Q, U

We want to maximize information, so we should choose a word that uses common letters or at least covers more possibilities.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on the third guess. We want to get as much information as possible.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't necessarily put I in the third position? But wait, we know that I is in the third position, so we must have I in the third position. So we cannot avoid that.

So we must have I in the third position.

Now, among the candidates, which one is the best?

We can also consider if there is a word that has S and T in the allowed positions and also includes more than two new letters? But we only have two positions to fill (if we fix I, S, and T) then we have two positions left, so at most two new letters.

But note: in the case of duplicates, we might have only one new letter (like in STILL, we have two L's, so only one new letter L).

So the candidates with two new letters are better.

Now, among TWIGS, UTILS, QUITS, which one?

Let's see the letter frequency in English to choose the most common letters.

Common letters that we haven't tried: 
We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The most common of these are: L, D, U, P, F, G, W, etc. (according to general English frequency).

But note: we are in a 5-letter word context.

Common letters in 5-letter words: we can look for frequent ones.

But without a list, we can use general knowledge: L, D, H, G, U, P, etc.

In TWIGS: we have G and W. G is fairly common, W is less common.
In UTILS: we have U and L. L is very common, U is less common.
In QUITS: we have Q and U. Q is very rare, U is less common.

So UTILS has L, which is a common letter, and U. TWIGS has G and W. QUITS has Q and U.

So UTILS and TWIGS might be better than QUITS because Q is rare.

Between UTILS and TWIGS, UTILS has L (which is more common than G and W) and U (which is about as common as U in UTILS and W in TWIGS?).

But note: in UTILS, we have U and L, and in TWIGS, we have W and G.

Letter frequency in English: 
L is about 4% of letters, G is about 2%, W is about 2%, U is about 2.5%. So L is the most common.

Therefore, UTILS might be better because it includes L, which is a high-frequency letter.

But we also have to consider the word structure.

Another candidate: what about ""BUILT""? But we need S. We know the word must contain S. So we cannot omit S.

Similarly, we must have T.

So we must include both S and T.

Another word: if we put S in position 5 and T in position 1, we had TWIGS. What about ""TOWIS""? Not a word.

Or ""DAISY"": but A is forbidden.

So let's go with UTILS.

But wait, in UTILS, the T is in position 2 and S in position 5. We know T is present and not in 5 (which is satisfied) and S is present and not in 4 (satisfied because it's in 5).

Also, the third letter is I, which is correct.

So UTILS: U, T, I, L, S.

We can also consider ""SULTI""? Not a word.

Or ""STILT"": but that has S in 1 and T in 5? STILT: S, T, I, L, T -> duplicate T? And T is in position 5, which is not allowed (because T cannot be in position 5). So invalid.

Therefore, I think UTILS is a good choice.

But let's confirm: 
- U: not tried before -> if it's in the word, we'll know.
- T: we know it's in the word, but we are putting it in position 2. If it's not in position 2, we'll get a '-' for T (present but wrong position) or if it is in position 2, we get a check.
- I: we know it's in position 3, so we expect a check.
- L: new letter.
- S: we know it's in the word, but we are putting it in position 5. If it's not in position 5, we get a '-'.

So we can get more information about the positions of T and S.

Alternatively, if we choose TWIGS: 
- T in 1: if T is not in 1, we get '-' (but we know T is in the word, so it would be present but not in 1).
- W: new.
- I: check.
- G: new.
- S: in 5, if not in 5, then '-'.

Similarly, we get information about T and S positions.

But UTILS has the advantage of having L, which is more common.

We might also consider ""PULIS"" but P is available, but then we have to fit the pattern. PULIS: P, U, L, I, S -> but then the third letter is L, not I. We need the third letter to be I.

So no.

Another word: ""HILTS"": H, I, L, T, S -> but then the third letter is L, not I. We need the third letter to be I. So HILTS: positions: 1:H, 2:I, 3:L -> but we need position 3 to be I, so that doesn't work.

So I think UTILS is a solid choice.

Therefore, we'll guess ""UTILS"".

But note: we must ensure that UTILS is a valid word. Yes, it is (meaning utilities or useful, or as a noun in some contexts).

So our next guess: UTILS.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x)**, so the secret word contains none of these letters.
- **Guess 2: ""moist"" → Feedback: M(x), O(x), I(✓), S(-), T(-)**. This means:
  - **I is correct and in position 3** (since it was the third letter in ""moist"").
  - **S is present but not in position 4**.
  - **T is present but not in position 5**.
  - M and O are absent.

### Key Constraints for the Next Guess:
1. **Position 3 must be I**.
2. **S must be included but not in position 4**.
3. **T must be included but not in position 5**.
4. **Avoid all letters from previous guesses**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O.
5. **Available positions for S**: 1, 2, or 5 (since position 3 is I, and position 4 is invalid for S).
6. **Available positions for T**: 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is I, and position 5 is invalid for T).

### Analysis and Word Selection:
- After evaluating possible words that fit the constraints (e.g., ""twigs"", ""utils"", ""quits""), **""utils""** was chosen because:
  - It places **I in position 3** (required).
  - It places **S in position 5** (valid, as S cannot be in position 4).
  - It places **T in position 2** (valid, as T cannot be in position 5).
  - It introduces **two new high-frequency letters (U and L)** to maximize information gain.
  - It avoids all forbidden letters and is a valid English word (meaning useful items or functions).

This guess tests the positions of S and T while exploring new letters, helping to narrow down possibilities efficiently.

<guess>utils</guess>",utils,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So the secret word has none of these letters.

Guess 2: ""moist"" -> 
  M(x) -> absent
  O(x) -> absent
  I(✓) -> correct, meaning the letter I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since I is the third letter in ""moist"")
  S(-) -> present, meaning S is in the word but not in the fourth position (since in ""moist"", S is the fourth letter)
  T(-) -> present, meaning T is in the word but not in the fifth position (since in ""moist"", T is the fifth letter)

So from guess 2, we know:
- The third letter is I.
- The word contains S and T, but S is not in position 4 and T is not in position 5.

Also, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has I as the third letter (position 3).
- Contains S and T (but S not in position 4, T not in position 5).
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, E, M, O.

Additionally, we must avoid the positions we know for S and T: S cannot be in position 4, and T cannot be in position 5.

Let's list the available letters: 
We have 26 letters minus the ones we know are absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, O. So we avoid these 7 letters.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: I, S, T are in the word, but we must place them appropriately.

Constraints:
- Position 3 must be I.
- The word must contain S and T (each exactly once? We don't know for sure, but we'll assume no duplicates until we have evidence. The feedback doesn't show duplicates, so we assume the word has unique letters for now, but note that Wordle can have duplicate letters. However, in this feedback, we don't have any indication of duplicates so far. Since in ""moist"" we had one S and one T, and the feedback for S and T was present (but wrong position), it doesn't rule out duplicates, but without evidence, we might assume no duplicates for efficiency. But let's be cautious: the secret word might have duplicate letters. However, since we are avoiding many letters, we'll try to form a word without duplicates first.)

We know S is in the word but not in position 4. Similarly, T is in the word but not in position 5.

Possible positions for S: positions 1, 2, 5 (since position 3 is I and position 4 is forbidden for S, and position 4 is the only one we know S cannot be in). Similarly, T cannot be in position 5, so T can be in positions 1, 2, 4.

But note: the word has 5 positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

So:
- Position 3: fixed as I.
- S can be in: 1, 2, 5 (because not 4, and 3 is taken by I).
- T can be in: 1, 2, 4 (because not 5, and 3 is taken by I).

We also need two more letters for the remaining positions, which must be from the available letters and not S or T (if we assume no duplicates) or possibly duplicates? But without evidence, we avoid duplicates for now.

So the word structure: 
Positions: 
1: ? (can be S, T, or another letter)
2: ? (can be S, T, or another letter)
3: I (fixed)
4: ? (can be T or another letter, but not S)
5: ? (can be S or another letter, but not T)

We know the word must have at least one S and one T, so one of the positions must be S and one must be T.

We have two cases for S and T: they might be in different positions, and we have to assign them to the available spots.

Possible assignments for S and T:

Option 1: S in position 1, then T can be in 2 or 4.
Option 2: S in position 2, then T can be in 1 or 4.
Option 3: S in position 5, then T can be in 1, 2, or 4.

But note: we have two more positions to fill (if we assign S and T to two positions, then the remaining two positions must be filled with two other letters).

We need to form a valid English word.

Let's think of words that have I in the third position and contain S and T.

We can list possible words:

- If S is in position 1: then the word starts with S, then the second letter is ?, then I, then ? (which can be T or another letter), and then ? (which can be another letter, but not T because T cannot be in position 5? Actually, T cannot be in position 5, so if S is in 1, then T must be in 2 or 4.

Example: 
  S _ I _ _
  If T is in 2: then S T I _ _ -> we need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. But position 5 cannot be T (already used and T is only one for now) and T is already in 2. So positions 4 and 5 must be two other letters. Words: ? 
  Possibilities: STI?? -> e.g., STILL (but L is available, but note we have I in position 3 and L in 4 and 5? But STILL has two L's. Also, we have to avoid E, A, etc. STILL: S, T, I, L, L. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to check if L is allowed? Yes, L is available. But the word has duplicate L's? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, but it's possible. However, let's see: if we guess STILL, then the feedback for the first S: we know S is present and in the correct position? But we don't know if the word has two S's? Actually, in STILL, there is only one S. But we have two L's. The secret word might have duplicate letters. But without evidence, we might avoid. Also, note that in STILL, the T is in position 2, which is allowed. But the feedback for T in ""moist"" was present but not in position 5, so it could be in 2. However, we must check if STILL is allowed? But STILL has two L's, and we don't know if that's the case. Also, we have to avoid the forbidden letters. STILL: S, T, I, L, L. The forbidden letters are C,R,A,N,E,M,O. L is not forbidden. So it's possible. But let's see if there are other words.

Alternatively, if S is in 1 and T in 4: then S _ I T _ -> we need the second and fifth letters. The fifth letter cannot be T (already used) and must be a letter that is not forbidden. So S ? I T ? -> words: SMITH (but M is forbidden, because in guess2 M was absent), so M cannot be used. Other words: SWIFT? W and F are available, but SWIFT: S, W, I, F, T -> but then T is in position 5? But T cannot be in position 5! Because in guess2, T was present but not in position 5, meaning in the secret word, T is not in position 5. So if we put T in position 5, that would be invalid. Therefore, we cannot have T in position 5. So in this case, if S is in 1 and T in 4, then the word is S ? I T ? and the fifth letter must not be T. But we already have T in position 4, so the fifth letter is something else. But the problem is that we have T in position 4, which is allowed (since T can be in 4). So words: 
  S ? I T ? 
  Examples: 
    SPITE: S, P, I, T, E -> but E is forbidden (from guess1). 
    SIGHT: S, I, G, H, T -> but wait, the third letter must be I, so S, ?, I, T, ? -> so the second letter must be between S and I. So S (letter2) I T (letter5). 
    So S?IT? -> the word must be of the form [S] [X] [I] [T] [Y]. 
    We need words that fit this pattern. 
    Possibilities: 
      SLITS: but that would be S, L, I, T, S -> but then we have two S's? And the last letter is S. But we are avoiding duplicates? Also, the fifth letter is S, which is allowed because S can be in position 5. But note: we already have S in position 1, so if the word has two S's, that's possible. But in the feedback for ""moist"", we had S marked as present (but wrong position) and we don't know if it was the only S. So duplicates are possible. 
      However, let's check: SLITS -> S in position 1 and 5. But we know that in the secret word, S is present and not in position 4, but it could be in 1 and 5? But we don't have evidence against duplicates. 
      But we must avoid forbidden letters. SLITS: S, L, I, T, S -> letters: S, L, I, T. All allowed? Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,M,O. So L, I, T, S are allowed. 
      But is SLITS a valid word? Yes, it is the plural of slit. 
      However, note that the third letter is I, which is fixed, and the fourth is T, which is allowed. 
      But we have T in position 4, which is allowed (since T cannot be in 5, but 4 is okay). 
      Also, S in position 1 and 5: that's two S's. 

  Another word: SHIFT: S, H, I, F, T -> but then the fourth letter is F and fifth is T. But we need T in the fourth position? No, in this pattern we are considering T in position 4. But in SHIFT, the T is in position 5, which is not allowed (because T cannot be in position 5). So SHIFT is invalid for this pattern because we are putting T in position 5.

  So back to S?IT? -> we need the fifth letter to be not T and not forbidden. 
  Examples: 
    SLIT: only 4 letters? We need 5.
    SPITS: S, P, I, T, S -> similar to SLITS, but with P. 
    SKITS: S, K, I, T, S -> also valid.

  But note: we have two S's in these words. 

Alternatively, if S is in position 2: 
  Then the word: _ S I _ _
  And T can be in position 1 or 4 (since T cannot be in 5, and position 3 is I).

  If T in 1: then T S I _ _ -> we need positions 4 and 5. 
    Example: TSID? -> not common. 
    TSADI? not a word. 
    TSARS: but then we have two S's? T, S, I, A, R -> but A and R are forbidden. 
    Not many common words.

  If T in 4: then _ S I T _ -> we need first and fifth letters. 
    Words: ? S I T ? 
    Examples: 
      VISIT: V, I, S, I, T -> but wait, the third letter is I, and we have I again? But in VISIT, the third letter is S? No: V-I-S-I-T -> positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T -> but we need the third letter to be I, so that doesn't match. 
      We need the pattern: [X] [S] [I] [T] [Y]
      So the word must have the second letter S, third I, fourth T. 
      Examples: 
        EXIST: E is forbidden.
        POSIT: P, O, S, I, T -> but O is forbidden (from guess2).
        DITSY: D, I, T, S, Y -> but that doesn't fit the pattern (we need second letter to be S, but in DITSY it's I in second).
        We need: ? S I T ? 
        Possibilities: 
          USUAL: doesn't fit.
          I can't think of many. Maybe ""SPITE"" but that is S in first, not second.

  This seems difficult. 

Now, the third option: S in position 5.
  Then the word: _ _ I _ S
  And T can be in 1, 2, or 4.

  If T in 1: T _ I _ S -> we need positions 2 and 4.
    Examples: T?I?S -> 
      TRAIS -> not a word.
      TWIGS: T, W, I, G, S -> that fits: T in 1, W in 2, I in 3, G in 4, S in 5. And W, G are allowed. 
      THIGS: not common.
      TRIPS: R and P? R is forbidden (from guess1). 
      So TWIGS is a possibility.

  If T in 2: _ T I _ S -> we need positions 1 and 4.
    Examples: ?T I ? S -> 
      UTILS: U, T, I, L, S -> fits: U in 1, T in 2, I in 3, L in 4, S in 5. 
      Also, UTILS is a valid word. 
      Other: STIRS: but S is in 5 and we have S in 1? But we are putting S in 5, so the first letter is not S. 
      Also, UTILS: U, T, I, L, S -> all letters allowed? U, T, I, L, S. Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,M,O. So U, T, I, L, S are all allowed.

  If T in 4: _ _ I T S -> we need positions 1 and 2.
    Examples: ? ? I T S -> 
      WAITS: W, A, I, T, S -> but A is forbidden.
      FRITS: F, R, I, T, S -> R forbidden.
      BLITS: B, L, I, T, S -> B and L allowed? Yes. BLITS is a word? It might be a variant of blitz? But blitz is 5 letters: B, L, I, T, Z -> not S. 
      So not many common words.

So from the above, we have a few candidate words:

1. From S in position 1 and T in position 2: STI?? -> but we need two more letters. We considered STILL (but duplicate L) and STING (but N is forbidden) and STICK (C forbidden). Actually, we didn't find a good one without forbidden letters? 

   Earlier I thought of STILL: S, T, I, L, L -> but duplicate L. But is that acceptable? The game allows duplicate letters. And we haven't ruled out L. So STILL is a candidate.

2. From S in position 1 and T in position 4: we had SLITS, SPITS, SKITS. 
   SLITS: S, L, I, T, S -> duplicate S. 
   SPITS: S, P, I, T, S -> duplicate S.
   SKITS: S, K, I, T, S -> duplicate S.

3. From S in position 5 and T in position 1: TWIGS: T, W, I, G, S -> no duplicates, and W, G are allowed.

4. From S in position 5 and T in position 2: UTILS: U, T, I, L, S -> no duplicates.

We also have the constraint that in the feedback for ""moist"", S was present but not in position 4, and T was present but not in position 5. 

In the candidate words:

- For STILL: 
  - S is in position 1 -> not 4, so okay.
  - T is in position 2 -> not 5, so okay.
  - But we have duplicate L? The secret word might have duplicate letters. We don't know.

- For SLITS (or SPITS, SKITS): 
  - S is in position 1 and 5 -> so one of the S's is in position 1 (which is not 4) and the other in 5 (which is not 4) so that's okay for S. 
  - T is in position 4 -> not 5, so okay.

- For TWIGS:
  - T is in position 1 -> not 5, okay.
  - S is in position 5 -> not 4, okay.

- For UTILS:
  - T is in position 2 -> not 5, okay.
  - S is in position 5 -> not 4, okay.

We need to choose one that is a valid word and tests new letters.

We also want to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.

Let's list the letters we have already tried: 
From guess1: C, R, A, N, E
From guess2: M, O, I, S, T

So we have tried: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T.

We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

In the candidates:

- STILL: uses S, T, I, L -> but we have already tried S, T, I, and L is new. So it only introduces one new letter (L) and we have duplicate L.

- SLITS: uses S, L, I, T -> same as above, but with duplicate S. Also, only one new letter L.

- TWIGS: uses T, W, I, G, S -> we have T, I, S already, and W and G are new. So two new letters.

- UTILS: uses U, T, I, L, S -> T, I, S already, and U and L are new. So two new letters.

So TWIGS and UTILS introduce two new letters each, which is better.

Between TWIGS and UTILS, which one to choose?

We can also consider other words that fit the pattern and introduce more new letters.

But let's see if there are words that use even more new letters? We have to fill the positions.

Another possibility: what if we put S in position 5 and T in position 4? Then we have _ _ I T S. We need two letters at the beginning. We thought of BLITS? But that might not be common. Other words: 
  DUITS -> not common.
  FRITS: F, R, I, T, S -> R forbidden.
  GRITS: G, R, I, T, S -> R forbidden.
  HITS: too short.
  QUITS: Q, U, I, T, S -> but we have I in third? QUITS: Q, U, I, T, S -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:T, 5:S -> that fits! And Q, U are new, and we avoid forbidden letters. 
  So QUITS: Q, U, I, T, S -> all allowed? Q, U, I, T, S. Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,M,O. So yes.

So QUITS is a candidate. It has:
- T in position 4 -> not 5, okay.
- S in position 5 -> not 4, okay.
- New letters: Q, U (and we already know I, T, S).

So it introduces two new letters: Q and U.

Now we have:
- TWIGS: T, W, I, G, S -> new letters: W, G
- UTILS: U, T, I, L, S -> new letters: U, L
- QUITS: Q, U, I, T, S -> new letters: Q, U

We want to maximize information, so we should choose a word that uses common letters or at least covers more possibilities.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on the third guess. We want to get as much information as possible.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't necessarily put I in the third position? But wait, we know that I is in the third position, so we must have I in the third position. So we cannot avoid that.

So we must have I in the third position.

Now, among the candidates, which one is the best?

We can also consider if there is a word that has S and T in the allowed positions and also includes more than two new letters? But we only have two positions to fill (if we fix I, S, and T) then we have two positions left, so at most two new letters.

But note: in the case of duplicates, we might have only one new letter (like in STILL, we have two L's, so only one new letter L).

So the candidates with two new letters are better.

Now, among TWIGS, UTILS, QUITS, which one?

Let's see the letter frequency in English to choose the most common letters.

Common letters that we haven't tried: 
We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The most common of these are: L, D, U, P, F, G, W, etc. (according to general English frequency).

But note: we are in a 5-letter word context.

Common letters in 5-letter words: we can look for frequent ones.

But without a list, we can use general knowledge: L, D, H, G, U, P, etc.

In TWIGS: we have G and W. G is fairly common, W is less common.
In UTILS: we have U and L. L is very common, U is less common.
In QUITS: we have Q and U. Q is very rare, U is less common.

So UTILS has L, which is a common letter, and U. TWIGS has G and W. QUITS has Q and U.

So UTILS and TWIGS might be better than QUITS because Q is rare.

Between UTILS and TWIGS, UTILS has L (which is more common than G and W) and U (which is about as common as U in UTILS and W in TWIGS?).

But note: in UTILS, we have U and L, and in TWIGS, we have W and G.

Letter frequency in English: 
L is about 4% of letters, G is about 2%, W is about 2%, U is about 2.5%. So L is the most common.

Therefore, UTILS might be better because it includes L, which is a high-frequency letter.

But we also have to consider the word structure.

Another candidate: what about ""BUILT""? But we need S. We know the word must contain S. So we cannot omit S.

Similarly, we must have T.

So we must include both S and T.

Another word: if we put S in position 5 and T in position 1, we had TWIGS. What about ""TOWIS""? Not a word.

Or ""DAISY"": but A is forbidden.

So let's go with UTILS.

But wait, in UTILS, the T is in position 2 and S in position 5. We know T is present and not in 5 (which is satisfied) and S is present and not in 4 (satisfied because it's in 5).

Also, the third letter is I, which is correct.

So UTILS: U, T, I, L, S.

We can also consider ""SULTI""? Not a word.

Or ""STILT"": but that has S in 1 and T in 5? STILT: S, T, I, L, T -> duplicate T? And T is in position 5, which is not allowed (because T cannot be in position 5). So invalid.

Therefore, I think UTILS is a good choice.

But let's confirm: 
- U: not tried before -> if it's in the word, we'll know.
- T: we know it's in the word, but we are putting it in position 2. If it's not in position 2, we'll get a '-' for T (present but wrong position) or if it is in position 2, we get a check.
- I: we know it's in position 3, so we expect a check.
- L: new letter.
- S: we know it's in the word, but we are putting it in position 5. If it's not in position 5, we get a '-'.

So we can get more information about the positions of T and S.

Alternatively, if we choose TWIGS: 
- T in 1: if T is not in 1, we get '-' (but we know T is in the word, so it would be present but not in 1).
- W: new.
- I: check.
- G: new.
- S: in 5, if not in 5, then '-'.

Similarly, we get information about T and S positions.

But UTILS has the advantage of having L, which is more common.

We might also consider ""PULIS"" but P is available, but then we have to fit the pattern. PULIS: P, U, L, I, S -> but then the third letter is L, not I. We need the third letter to be I.

So no.

Another word: ""HILTS"": H, I, L, T, S -> but then the third letter is L, not I. We need the third letter to be I. So HILTS: positions: 1:H, 2:I, 3:L -> but we need position 3 to be I, so that doesn't work.

So I think UTILS is a solid choice.

Therefore, we'll guess ""UTILS"".

But note: we must ensure that UTILS is a valid word. Yes, it is (meaning utilities or useful, or as a noun in some contexts).

So our next guess: UTILS.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x)**, so the secret word contains none of these letters.
- **Guess 2: ""moist"" → Feedback: M(x), O(x), I(✓), S(-), T(-)**. This means:
  - **I is correct and in position 3** (since it was the third letter in ""moist"").
  - **S is present but not in position 4**.
  - **T is present but not in position 5**.
  - M and O are absent.

### Key Constraints for the Next Guess:
1. **Position 3 must be I**.
2. **S must be included but not in position 4**.
3. **T must be included but not in position 5**.
4. **Avoid all letters from previous guesses**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O.
5. **Available positions for S**: 1, 2, or 5 (since position 3 is I, and position 4 is invalid for S).
6. **Available positions for T**: 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is I, and position 5 is invalid for T).

### Analysis and Word Selection:
- After evaluating possible words that fit the constraints (e.g., ""twigs"", ""utils"", ""quits""), **""utils""** was chosen because:
  - It places **I in position 3** (required).
  - It places **S in position 5** (valid, as S cannot be in position 4).
  - It places **T in position 2** (valid, as T cannot be in position 5).
  - It introduces **two new high-frequency letters (U and L)** to maximize information gain.
  - It avoids all forbidden letters and is a valid English word (meaning useful items or functions).

This guess tests the positions of S and T while exploring new letters, helping to narrow down possibilities efficiently.",Guess 3: utils -> FEEDBACK: U(x) T(✓) I(✓) L(✓) S(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,STILL,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think about the frequency of letters in English words. The most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc.
 We want a word that has 5 distinct letters to maximize information.

 I recall that ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning a roll of money or wealth) and it uses common letters. However, let me check if it's valid.
 Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is also a good one.

 But let me choose a word that has a good balance: ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. These are common letters.

 However, note that the game requires a valid 5-letter English word.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

 Since none of these letters are present, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think about the remaining letters. We have to form a valid English word.

 Common letters that are left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to maximize the information we get, so we should try to include common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 The most common letters in English (without the ones we've tried) might be: S, T, O, L, I, etc.

 Let's try to form a word with as many of these as possible.

 Some possibilities:
 - ""TOILS"": but we haven't tried T, O, I, L, S. However, note that we must avoid E, A, R, N, C.

 But wait, we haven't tried T, O, I, L, S. So that could be a candidate.

 However, we might also consider ""PIOUS"", but that has P, I, O, U, S. U is less common.

 Another common word: ""SLIMY"" - S, L, I, M, Y.

 But let's think of words that use the most common remaining letters.

 According to letter frequency, after removing C, R, A, N, E, the next most common are: T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 So a good candidate might be ""TOILS"" or ""STOIC"" but note that we cannot use C (from the first feedback). So ""STOIC"" is invalid because it has C.

 Another word: ""MOIST"" - M, O, I, S, T. This uses common letters and avoids the forbidden ones.

 Similarly, ""PILOT"" has P, I, L, O, T. But note that we haven't tried P, I, L, O, T.

 However, we must ensure the word is valid.

 Let me list a few options:
 1. ""MOIST"" - meaning slightly wet.
 2. ""PILOT"" - a person who operates an aircraft.
 3. ""BUOYS"" - but that has U and Y, which are less common, and also we haven't tried B, U, O, Y, S.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 The word ""MOIST"" has M, O, I, S, T. All of these are common.

 Alternatively, ""LUSTY"" - but that has L, U, S, T, Y. U and Y are less common.

 Another option: ""GHOUL"" - but that has G, H, O, U, L. U is less common and we might not get much information.

 Considering the above, I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it uses M, O, I, S, T, which are all common and we haven't tried them.

 So, let's go with ""MOIST"".

 But note: we must be cautious because the word must be valid. ""MOIST"" is a valid English word.

 Therefore, our next guess is ""MOIST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), the secret word contains none of these letters. For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely and tests new common letters like S, T, O, I, L, or M to gather more information. 

After considering options like ""toils"" (which uses T, O, I, L, S) and ""pilot"" (P, I, L, O, T), I selected ""moist"" because it:
- Uses high-frequency letters (M, O, I, S, T) not yet tested
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E)
- Is a valid English word

This guess maximizes the chance of revealing correct letters/positions while covering new ground.

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(✓) S(-) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So the secret word has none of these letters.

Guess 2: ""moist"" -> 
  M(x) -> absent
  O(x) -> absent
  I(✓) -> correct, meaning the letter I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since I is the third letter in ""moist"")
  S(-) -> present, meaning S is in the word but not in the fourth position (since in ""moist"", S is the fourth letter)
  T(-) -> present, meaning T is in the word but not in the fifth position (since in ""moist"", T is the fifth letter)

So from guess 2, we know:
- The third letter is I.
- The word contains S and T, but S is not in position 4 and T is not in position 5.

Also, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has I as the third letter (position 3).
- Contains S and T (but S not in position 4, T not in position 5).
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, E, M, O.

Additionally, we must avoid the positions we know for S and T: S cannot be in position 4, and T cannot be in position 5.

Let's list the available letters: 
We have 26 letters minus the ones we know are absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, O. So we avoid these 7 letters.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: I, S, T are in the word, but we must place them appropriately.

Constraints:
- Position 3 must be I.
- The word must contain S and T (each exactly once? We don't know for sure, but we'll assume no duplicates until we have evidence. The feedback doesn't show duplicates, so we assume the word has unique letters for now, but note that Wordle can have duplicate letters. However, in this feedback, we don't have any indication of duplicates so far. Since in ""moist"" we had one S and one T, and the feedback for S and T was present (but wrong position), it doesn't rule out duplicates, but without evidence, we might assume no duplicates for efficiency. But let's be cautious: the secret word might have duplicate letters. However, since we are avoiding many letters, we'll try to form a word without duplicates first.)

We know S is in the word but not in position 4. Similarly, T is in the word but not in position 5.

Possible positions for S: positions 1, 2, 5 (since position 3 is I and position 4 is forbidden for S, and position 4 is the only one we know S cannot be in). Similarly, T cannot be in position 5, so T can be in positions 1, 2, 4.

But note: the word has 5 positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

So:
- Position 3: fixed as I.
- S can be in: 1, 2, 5 (because not 4, and 3 is taken by I).
- T can be in: 1, 2, 4 (because not 5, and 3 is taken by I).

We also need two more letters for the remaining positions, which must be from the available letters and not S or T (if we assume no duplicates) or possibly duplicates? But without evidence, we avoid duplicates for now.

So the word structure: 
Positions: 
1: ? (can be S, T, or another letter)
2: ? (can be S, T, or another letter)
3: I (fixed)
4: ? (can be T or another letter, but not S)
5: ? (can be S or another letter, but not T)

We know the word must have at least one S and one T, so one of the positions must be S and one must be T.

We have two cases for S and T: they might be in different positions, and we have to assign them to the available spots.

Possible assignments for S and T:

Option 1: S in position 1, then T can be in 2 or 4.
Option 2: S in position 2, then T can be in 1 or 4.
Option 3: S in position 5, then T can be in 1, 2, or 4.

But note: we have two more positions to fill (if we assign S and T to two positions, then the remaining two positions must be filled with two other letters).

We need to form a valid English word.

Let's think of words that have I in the third position and contain S and T.

We can list possible words:

- If S is in position 1: then the word starts with S, then the second letter is ?, then I, then ? (which can be T or another letter), and then ? (which can be another letter, but not T because T cannot be in position 5? Actually, T cannot be in position 5, so if S is in 1, then T must be in 2 or 4.

Example: 
  S _ I _ _
  If T is in 2: then S T I _ _ -> we need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. But position 5 cannot be T (already used and T is only one for now) and T is already in 2. So positions 4 and 5 must be two other letters. Words: ? 
  Possibilities: STI?? -> e.g., STILL (but L is available, but note we have I in position 3 and L in 4 and 5? But STILL has two L's. Also, we have to avoid E, A, etc. STILL: S, T, I, L, L. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to check if L is allowed? Yes, L is available. But the word has duplicate L's? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, but it's possible. However, let's see: if we guess STILL, then the feedback for the first S: we know S is present and in the correct position? But we don't know if the word has two S's? Actually, in STILL, there is only one S. But we have two L's. The secret word might have duplicate letters. But without evidence, we might avoid. Also, note that in STILL, the T is in position 2, which is allowed. But the feedback for T in ""moist"" was present but not in position 5, so it could be in 2. However, we must check if STILL is allowed? But STILL has two L's, and we don't know if that's the case. Also, we have to avoid the forbidden letters. STILL: S, T, I, L, L. The forbidden letters are C,R,A,N,E,M,O. L is not forbidden. So it's possible. But let's see if there are other words.

Alternatively, if S is in 1 and T in 4: then S _ I T _ -> we need the second and fifth letters. The fifth letter cannot be T (already used) and must be a letter that is not forbidden. So S ? I T ? -> words: SMITH (but M is forbidden, because in guess2 M was absent), so M cannot be used. Other words: SWIFT? W and F are available, but SWIFT: S, W, I, F, T -> but then T is in position 5? But T cannot be in position 5! Because in guess2, T was present but not in position 5, meaning in the secret word, T is not in position 5. So if we put T in position 5, that would be invalid. Therefore, we cannot have T in position 5. So in this case, if S is in 1 and T in 4, then the word is S ? I T ? and the fifth letter must not be T. But we already have T in position 4, so the fifth letter is something else. But the problem is that we have T in position 4, which is allowed (since T can be in 4). So words: 
  S ? I T ? 
  Examples: 
    SPITE: S, P, I, T, E -> but E is forbidden (from guess1). 
    SIGHT: S, I, G, H, T -> but wait, the third letter must be I, so S, ?, I, T, ? -> so the second letter must be between S and I. So S (letter2) I T (letter5). 
    So S?IT? -> the word must be of the form [S] [X] [I] [T] [Y]. 
    We need words that fit this pattern. 
    Possibilities: 
      SLITS: but that would be S, L, I, T, S -> but then we have two S's? And the last letter is S. But we are avoiding duplicates? Also, the fifth letter is S, which is allowed because S can be in position 5. But note: we already have S in position 1, so if the word has two S's, that's possible. But in the feedback for ""moist"", we had S marked as present (but wrong position) and we don't know if it was the only S. So duplicates are possible. 
      However, let's check: SLITS -> S in position 1 and 5. But we know that in the secret word, S is present and not in position 4, but it could be in 1 and 5? But we don't have evidence against duplicates. 
      But we must avoid forbidden letters. SLITS: S, L, I, T, S -> letters: S, L, I, T. All allowed? Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,M,O. So L, I, T, S are allowed. 
      But is SLITS a valid word? Yes, it is the plural of slit. 
      However, note that the third letter is I, which is fixed, and the fourth is T, which is allowed. 
      But we have T in position 4, which is allowed (since T cannot be in 5, but 4 is okay). 
      Also, S in position 1 and 5: that's two S's. 

  Another word: SHIFT: S, H, I, F, T -> but then the fourth letter is F and fifth is T. But we need T in the fourth position? No, in this pattern we are considering T in position 4. But in SHIFT, the T is in position 5, which is not allowed (because T cannot be in position 5). So SHIFT is invalid for this pattern because we are putting T in position 5.

  So back to S?IT? -> we need the fifth letter to be not T and not forbidden. 
  Examples: 
    SLIT: only 4 letters? We need 5.
    SPITS: S, P, I, T, S -> similar to SLITS, but with P. 
    SKITS: S, K, I, T, S -> also valid.

  But note: we have two S's in these words. 

Alternatively, if S is in position 2: 
  Then the word: _ S I _ _
  And T can be in position 1 or 4 (since T cannot be in 5, and position 3 is I).

  If T in 1: then T S I _ _ -> we need positions 4 and 5. 
    Example: TSID? -> not common. 
    TSADI? not a word. 
    TSARS: but then we have two S's? T, S, I, A, R -> but A and R are forbidden. 
    Not many common words.

  If T in 4: then _ S I T _ -> we need first and fifth letters. 
    Words: ? S I T ? 
    Examples: 
      VISIT: V, I, S, I, T -> but wait, the third letter is I, and we have I again? But in VISIT, the third letter is S? No: V-I-S-I-T -> positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T -> but we need the third letter to be I, so that doesn't match. 
      We need the pattern: [X] [S] [I] [T] [Y]
      So the word must have the second letter S, third I, fourth T. 
      Examples: 
        EXIST: E is forbidden.
        POSIT: P, O, S, I, T -> but O is forbidden (from guess2).
        DITSY: D, I, T, S, Y -> but that doesn't fit the pattern (we need second letter to be S, but in DITSY it's I in second).
        We need: ? S I T ? 
        Possibilities: 
          USUAL: doesn't fit.
          I can't think of many. Maybe ""SPITE"" but that is S in first, not second.

  This seems difficult. 

Now, the third option: S in position 5.
  Then the word: _ _ I _ S
  And T can be in 1, 2, or 4.

  If T in 1: T _ I _ S -> we need positions 2 and 4.
    Examples: T?I?S -> 
      TRAIS -> not a word.
      TWIGS: T, W, I, G, S -> that fits: T in 1, W in 2, I in 3, G in 4, S in 5. And W, G are allowed. 
      THIGS: not common.
      TRIPS: R and P? R is forbidden (from guess1). 
      So TWIGS is a possibility.

  If T in 2: _ T I _ S -> we need positions 1 and 4.
    Examples: ?T I ? S -> 
      UTILS: U, T, I, L, S -> fits: U in 1, T in 2, I in 3, L in 4, S in 5. 
      Also, UTILS is a valid word. 
      Other: STIRS: but S is in 5 and we have S in 1? But we are putting S in 5, so the first letter is not S. 
      Also, UTILS: U, T, I, L, S -> all letters allowed? U, T, I, L, S. Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,M,O. So U, T, I, L, S are all allowed.

  If T in 4: _ _ I T S -> we need positions 1 and 2.
    Examples: ? ? I T S -> 
      WAITS: W, A, I, T, S -> but A is forbidden.
      FRITS: F, R, I, T, S -> R forbidden.
      BLITS: B, L, I, T, S -> B and L allowed? Yes. BLITS is a word? It might be a variant of blitz? But blitz is 5 letters: B, L, I, T, Z -> not S. 
      So not many common words.

So from the above, we have a few candidate words:

1. From S in position 1 and T in position 2: STI?? -> but we need two more letters. We considered STILL (but duplicate L) and STING (but N is forbidden) and STICK (C forbidden). Actually, we didn't find a good one without forbidden letters? 

   Earlier I thought of STILL: S, T, I, L, L -> but duplicate L. But is that acceptable? The game allows duplicate letters. And we haven't ruled out L. So STILL is a candidate.

2. From S in position 1 and T in position 4: we had SLITS, SPITS, SKITS. 
   SLITS: S, L, I, T, S -> duplicate S. 
   SPITS: S, P, I, T, S -> duplicate S.
   SKITS: S, K, I, T, S -> duplicate S.

3. From S in position 5 and T in position 1: TWIGS: T, W, I, G, S -> no duplicates, and W, G are allowed.

4. From S in position 5 and T in position 2: UTILS: U, T, I, L, S -> no duplicates.

We also have the constraint that in the feedback for ""moist"", S was present but not in position 4, and T was present but not in position 5. 

In the candidate words:

- For STILL: 
  - S is in position 1 -> not 4, so okay.
  - T is in position 2 -> not 5, so okay.
  - But we have duplicate L? The secret word might have duplicate letters. We don't know.

- For SLITS (or SPITS, SKITS): 
  - S is in position 1 and 5 -> so one of the S's is in position 1 (which is not 4) and the other in 5 (which is not 4) so that's okay for S. 
  - T is in position 4 -> not 5, so okay.

- For TWIGS:
  - T is in position 1 -> not 5, okay.
  - S is in position 5 -> not 4, okay.

- For UTILS:
  - T is in position 2 -> not 5, okay.
  - S is in position 5 -> not 4, okay.

We need to choose one that is a valid word and tests new letters.

We also want to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.

Let's list the letters we have already tried: 
From guess1: C, R, A, N, E
From guess2: M, O, I, S, T

So we have tried: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T.

We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

In the candidates:

- STILL: uses S, T, I, L -> but we have already tried S, T, I, and L is new. So it only introduces one new letter (L) and we have duplicate L.

- SLITS: uses S, L, I, T -> same as above, but with duplicate S. Also, only one new letter L.

- TWIGS: uses T, W, I, G, S -> we have T, I, S already, and W and G are new. So two new letters.

- UTILS: uses U, T, I, L, S -> T, I, S already, and U and L are new. So two new letters.

So TWIGS and UTILS introduce two new letters each, which is better.

Between TWIGS and UTILS, which one to choose?

We can also consider other words that fit the pattern and introduce more new letters.

But let's see if there are words that use even more new letters? We have to fill the positions.

Another possibility: what if we put S in position 5 and T in position 4? Then we have _ _ I T S. We need two letters at the beginning. We thought of BLITS? But that might not be common. Other words: 
  DUITS -> not common.
  FRITS: F, R, I, T, S -> R forbidden.
  GRITS: G, R, I, T, S -> R forbidden.
  HITS: too short.
  QUITS: Q, U, I, T, S -> but we have I in third? QUITS: Q, U, I, T, S -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:T, 5:S -> that fits! And Q, U are new, and we avoid forbidden letters. 
  So QUITS: Q, U, I, T, S -> all allowed? Q, U, I, T, S. Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,M,O. So yes.

So QUITS is a candidate. It has:
- T in position 4 -> not 5, okay.
- S in position 5 -> not 4, okay.
- New letters: Q, U (and we already know I, T, S).

So it introduces two new letters: Q and U.

Now we have:
- TWIGS: T, W, I, G, S -> new letters: W, G
- UTILS: U, T, I, L, S -> new letters: U, L
- QUITS: Q, U, I, T, S -> new letters: Q, U

We want to maximize information, so we should choose a word that uses common letters or at least covers more possibilities.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on the third guess. We want to get as much information as possible.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't necessarily put I in the third position? But wait, we know that I is in the third position, so we must have I in the third position. So we cannot avoid that.

So we must have I in the third position.

Now, among the candidates, which one is the best?

We can also consider if there is a word that has S and T in the allowed positions and also includes more than two new letters? But we only have two positions to fill (if we fix I, S, and T) then we have two positions left, so at most two new letters.

But note: in the case of duplicates, we might have only one new letter (like in STILL, we have two L's, so only one new letter L).

So the candidates with two new letters are better.

Now, among TWIGS, UTILS, QUITS, which one?

Let's see the letter frequency in English to choose the most common letters.

Common letters that we haven't tried: 
We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The most common of these are: L, D, U, P, F, G, W, etc. (according to general English frequency).

But note: we are in a 5-letter word context.

Common letters in 5-letter words: we can look for frequent ones.

But without a list, we can use general knowledge: L, D, H, G, U, P, etc.

In TWIGS: we have G and W. G is fairly common, W is less common.
In UTILS: we have U and L. L is very common, U is less common.
In QUITS: we have Q and U. Q is very rare, U is less common.

So UTILS has L, which is a common letter, and U. TWIGS has G and W. QUITS has Q and U.

So UTILS and TWIGS might be better than QUITS because Q is rare.

Between UTILS and TWIGS, UTILS has L (which is more common than G and W) and U (which is about as common as U in UTILS and W in TWIGS?).

But note: in UTILS, we have U and L, and in TWIGS, we have W and G.

Letter frequency in English: 
L is about 4% of letters, G is about 2%, W is about 2%, U is about 2.5%. So L is the most common.

Therefore, UTILS might be better because it includes L, which is a high-frequency letter.

But we also have to consider the word structure.

Another candidate: what about ""BUILT""? But we need S. We know the word must contain S. So we cannot omit S.

Similarly, we must have T.

So we must include both S and T.

Another word: if we put S in position 5 and T in position 1, we had TWIGS. What about ""TOWIS""? Not a word.

Or ""DAISY"": but A is forbidden.

So let's go with UTILS.

But wait, in UTILS, the T is in position 2 and S in position 5. We know T is present and not in 5 (which is satisfied) and S is present and not in 4 (satisfied because it's in 5).

Also, the third letter is I, which is correct.

So UTILS: U, T, I, L, S.

We can also consider ""SULTI""? Not a word.

Or ""STILT"": but that has S in 1 and T in 5? STILT: S, T, I, L, T -> duplicate T? And T is in position 5, which is not allowed (because T cannot be in position 5). So invalid.

Therefore, I think UTILS is a good choice.

But let's confirm: 
- U: not tried before -> if it's in the word, we'll know.
- T: we know it's in the word, but we are putting it in position 2. If it's not in position 2, we'll get a '-' for T (present but wrong position) or if it is in position 2, we get a check.
- I: we know it's in position 3, so we expect a check.
- L: new letter.
- S: we know it's in the word, but we are putting it in position 5. If it's not in position 5, we get a '-'.

So we can get more information about the positions of T and S.

Alternatively, if we choose TWIGS: 
- T in 1: if T is not in 1, we get '-' (but we know T is in the word, so it would be present but not in 1).
- W: new.
- I: check.
- G: new.
- S: in 5, if not in 5, then '-'.

Similarly, we get information about T and S positions.

But UTILS has the advantage of having L, which is more common.

We might also consider ""PULIS"" but P is available, but then we have to fit the pattern. PULIS: P, U, L, I, S -> but then the third letter is L, not I. We need the third letter to be I.

So no.

Another word: ""HILTS"": H, I, L, T, S -> but then the third letter is L, not I. We need the third letter to be I. So HILTS: positions: 1:H, 2:I, 3:L -> but we need position 3 to be I, so that doesn't work.

So I think UTILS is a solid choice.

Therefore, we'll guess ""UTILS"".

But note: we must ensure that UTILS is a valid word. Yes, it is (meaning utilities or useful, or as a noun in some contexts).

So our next guess: UTILS.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x)**, so the secret word contains none of these letters.
- **Guess 2: ""moist"" → Feedback: M(x), O(x), I(✓), S(-), T(-)**. This means:
  - **I is correct and in position 3** (since it was the third letter in ""moist"").
  - **S is present but not in position 4**.
  - **T is present but not in position 5**.
  - M and O are absent.

### Key Constraints for the Next Guess:
1. **Position 3 must be I**.
2. **S must be included but not in position 4**.
3. **T must be included but not in position 5**.
4. **Avoid all letters from previous guesses**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O.
5. **Available positions for S**: 1, 2, or 5 (since position 3 is I, and position 4 is invalid for S).
6. **Available positions for T**: 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is I, and position 5 is invalid for T).

### Analysis and Word Selection:
- After evaluating possible words that fit the constraints (e.g., ""twigs"", ""utils"", ""quits""), **""utils""** was chosen because:
  - It places **I in position 3** (required).
  - It places **S in position 5** (valid, as S cannot be in position 4).
  - It places **T in position 2** (valid, as T cannot be in position 5).
  - It introduces **two new high-frequency letters (U and L)** to maximize information gain.
  - It avoids all forbidden letters and is a valid English word (meaning useful items or functions).

This guess tests the positions of S and T while exploring new letters, helping to narrow down possibilities efficiently.

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.\n Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n Let me think about the frequency of letters in English words. The most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc.\n We want a word that has 5 distinct letters to maximize information.\n\n I recall that ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning a roll of money or wealth) and it uses common letters. However, let me check if it\'s valid.\n Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is also a good one.\n\n But let me choose a word that has a good balance: ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. These are common letters.\n\n However, note that the game requires a valid 5-letter English word.\n\n I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.\n\n So, my first guess is: CRANE\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.\n\n Since none of these letters are present, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.\n\n We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.\n\n Let\'s think about the remaining letters. We have to form a valid English word.\n\n Common letters that are left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We want to maximize the information we get, so we should try to include common letters that we haven\'t tried yet.\n\n The most common letters in English (without the ones we\'ve tried) might be: S, T, O, L, I, etc.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word with as many of these as possible.\n\n Some possibilities:\n - ""TOILS"": but we haven\'t tried T, O, I, L, S. However, note that we must avoid E, A, R, N, C.\n\n But wait, we haven\'t tried T, O, I, L, S. So that could be a candidate.\n\n However, we might also consider ""PIOUS"", but that has P, I, O, U, S. U is less common.\n\n Another common word: ""SLIMY"" - S, L, I, M, Y.\n\n But let\'s think of words that use the most common remaining letters.\n\n According to letter frequency, after removing C, R, A, N, E, the next most common are: T, O, I, S, L, etc.\n\n So a good candidate might be ""TOILS"" or ""STOIC"" but note that we cannot use C (from the first feedback). So ""STOIC"" is invalid because it has C.\n\n Another word: ""MOIST"" - M, O, I, S, T. This uses common letters and avoids the forbidden ones.\n\n Similarly, ""PILOT"" has P, I, L, O, T. But note that we haven\'t tried P, I, L, O, T.\n\n However, we must ensure the word is valid.\n\n Let me list a few options:\n 1. ""MOIST"" - meaning slightly wet.\n 2. ""PILOT"" - a person who operates an aircraft.\n 3. ""BUOYS"" - but that has U and Y, which are less common, and also we haven\'t tried B, U, O, Y, S.\n\n We want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n The word ""MOIST"" has M, O, I, S, T. All of these are common.\n\n Alternatively, ""LUSTY"" - but that has L, U, S, T, Y. U and Y are less common.\n\n Another option: ""GHOUL"" - but that has G, H, O, U, L. U is less common and we might not get much information.\n\n Considering the above, I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it uses M, O, I, S, T, which are all common and we haven\'t tried them.\n\n So, let\'s go with ""MOIST"".\n\n But note: we must be cautious because the word must be valid. ""MOIST"" is a valid English word.\n\n Therefore, our next guess is ""MOIST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), the secret word contains none of these letters. For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely and tests new common letters like S, T, O, I, L, or M to gather more information. \n\nAfter considering options like ""toils"" (which uses T, O, I, L, S) and ""pilot"" (P, I, L, O, T), I selected ""moist"" because it:\n- Uses high-frequency letters (M, O, I, S, T) not yet tested\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E)\n- Is a valid English word\n\nThis guess maximizes the chance of revealing correct letters/positions while covering new ground.\n\n<guess>moist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(✓) S(-) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x).

So we avoid these 7 letters.\n\nAvailable: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: I, S, T are in the word, but we must place them appropriately.\n\nConstraints:\n- Position 3 must be I.\n- The word must contain S and T (each exactly once? We don\'t know for sure, but we\'ll assume no duplicates until we have evidence. The feedback doesn\'t show duplicates, so we assume the word has unique letters for now, but note that Wordle can have duplicate letters. However, in this feedback, we don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far. Since in ""moist"" we had one S and one T, and the feedback for S and T was present (but wrong position), it doesn\'t rule out duplicates, but without evidence, we might assume no duplicates for efficiency. But let\'s be cautious: the secret word might have duplicate letters. However, since we are avoiding many letters, we\'ll try to form a word without duplicates first.)\n\nWe know S is in the word but not in position 4. Similarly, T is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nPossible positions for S: positions 1, 2, 5 (since position 3 is I and position 4 is forbidden for S, and position 4 is the only one we know S cannot be in). Similarly, T cannot be in position 5, so T can be in positions 1, 2, 4.\n\nBut note: the word has 5 positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nSo:\n- Position 3: fixed as I.\n- S can be in: 1, 2, 5 (because not 4, and 3 is taken by I).\n- T can be in: 1, 2, 4 (because not 5, and 3 is taken by I).\n\nWe also need two more letters for the remaining positions, which must be from the available letters and not S or T (if we assume no duplicates) or possibly duplicates? But without evidence, we avoid duplicates for now.\n\nSo the word structure: \nPositions: \n1: ? (can be S, T, or another letter)\n2: ? (can be S, T, or another letter)\n3: I (fixed)\n4: ? (can be T or another letter, but not S)\n5: ? (can be S or another letter, but not T)\n\nWe know the word must have at least one S and one T, so one of the positions must be S and one must be T.\n\nWe have two cases for S and T: they might be in different positions, and we have to assign them to the available spots.\n\nPossible assignments for S and T:\n\nOption 1: S in position 1, then T can be in 2 or 4.\nOption 2: S in position 2, then T can be in 1 or 4.\nOption 3: S in position 5, then T can be in 1, 2, or 4.\n\nBut note: we have two more positions to fill (if we assign S and T to two positions, then the remaining two positions must be filled with two other letters).\n\nWe need to form a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have I in the third position and contain S and T.\n\nWe can list possible words:\n\n- If S is in position 1: then the word starts with S, then the second letter is ?, then I, then ? (which can be T or another letter), and then ? (which can be another letter, but not T because T cannot be in position 5? Actually, T cannot be in position 5, so if S is in 1, then T must be in 2 or 4.\n\nExample: \n  S _ I _ _\n  If T is in 2: then S T I _ _ -> we need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. But position 5 cannot be T (already used and T is only one for now) and T is already in 2. So positions 4 and 5 must be two other letters. Words: ? \n  Possibilities: STI?? -> e.g., STILL (but L is available, but note we have I in position 3 and L in 4 and 5? But STILL has two L\'s. Also, we have to avoid E, A, etc. STILL: S, T, I, L, L. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to check if L is allowed? Yes, L is available. But the word has duplicate L\'s? The feedback doesn\'t indicate duplicates, but it\'s possible. However, let\'s see: if we guess STILL, then the feedback for the first S: we know S is present and in the correct position? But we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s? Actually, in STILL, there is only one S. But we have two L\'s. The secret word might have duplicate letters. But without evidence, we might avoid. Also, note that in STILL, the T is in position 2, which is allowed. But the feedback for T in ""moist"" was present but not in position 5, so it could be in 2. However, we must check if STILL is allowed? But STILL has two L\'s, and we don\'t know if that\'s the case. Also, we have to avoid the forbidden letters. STILL: S, T, I, L, L. The forbidden letters are C,R,A,N,E,M,O. L is not forbidden. So it\'s possible. But let\'s see if there are other words.\n\nAlternatively, if S is in 1 and T in 4: then S _ I T _ -> we need the second and fifth letters. The fifth letter cannot be T (already used) and must be a letter that is not forbidden. So S ? I T ? -> words: SMITH (but M is forbidden, because in guess2 M was absent), so M cannot be used. Other words: SWIFT? W and F are available, but SWIFT: S, W, I, F, T -> but then T is in position 5? But T cannot be in position 5! Because in guess2, T was present but not in position 5, meaning in the secret word, T is not in position 5. So if we put T in position 5, that would be invalid. Therefore, we cannot have T in position 5. So in this case, if S is in 1 and T in 4, then the word is S ? I T ? and the fifth letter must not be T. But we already have T in position 4, so the fifth letter is something else. But the problem is that we have T in position 4, which is allowed (since T can be in 4). So words: \n  S ? I T ? \n  Examples: \n    SPITE: S, P, I, T, E -> but E is forbidden (from guess1). \n    SIGHT: S, I, G, H, T -> but wait, the third letter must be I, so S, ?, I, T, ? -> so the second letter must be between S and I. So S (letter2) I T (letter5). \n    So S?IT? -> the word must be of the form [S] [X] [I] [T] [Y]. \n    We need words that fit this pattern. \n    Possibilities: \n      SLITS: but that would be S, L, I, T, S -> but then we have two S\'s? And the last letter is S. But we are avoiding duplicates? Also, the fifth letter is S, which is allowed because S can be in position 5. But note: we already have S in position 1, so if the word has two S\'s, that\'s possible. But in the feedback for ""moist"", we had S marked as present (but wrong position) and we don\'t know if it was the only S. So duplicates are possible. \n      However, let\'s check: SLITS -> S in position 1 and 5. But we know that in the secret word, S is present and not in position 4, but it could be in 1 and 5? But we don\'t have evidence against duplicates. \n      But we must avoid forbidden letters. SLITS: S, L, I, T, S -> letters: S, L, I, T. All allowed? Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,M,O. So L, I, T, S are allowed. \n      But is SLITS a valid word? Yes, it is the plural of slit. \n      However, note that the third letter is I, which is fixed, and the fourth is T, which is allowed. \n      But we have T in position 4, which is allowed (since T cannot be in 5, but 4 is okay). \n      Also, S in position 1 and 5: that\'s two S\'s. \n\n  Another word: SHIFT: S, H, I, F, T -> but then the fourth letter is F and fifth is T. But we need T in the fourth position? No, in this pattern we are considering T in position 4. But in SHIFT, the T is in position 5, which is not allowed (because T cannot be in position 5). So SHIFT is invalid for this pattern because we are putting T in position 5.\n\n  So back to S?IT? -> we need the fifth letter to be not T and not forbidden. \n  Examples: \n    SLIT: only 4 letters? We need 5.\n    SPITS: S, P, I, T, S -> similar to SLITS, but with P. \n    SKITS: S, K, I, T, S -> also valid.\n\n  But note: we have two S\'s in these words. \n\nAlternatively, if S is in position 2: \n  Then the word: _ S I _ _\n  And T can be in position 1 or 4 (since T cannot be in 5, and position 3 is I).\n\n  If T in 1: then T S I _ _ -> we need positions 4 and 5. \n    Example: TSID? -> not common. \n    TSADI? not a word. \n    TSARS: but then we have two S\'s? T, S, I, A, R -> but A and R are forbidden. \n    Not many common words.\n\n  If T in 4: then _ S I T _ -> we need first and fifth letters. \n    Words: ? S I T ? \n    Examples: \n      VISIT: V, I, S, I, T -> but wait, the third letter is I, and we have I again? But in VISIT, the third letter is S? No: V-I-S-I-T -> positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T -> but we need the third letter to be I, so that doesn\'t match. \n      We need the pattern: [X] [S] [I] [T] [Y]\n      So the word must have the second letter S, third I, fourth T. \n      Examples: \n        EXIST: E is forbidden.\n        POSIT: P, O, S, I, T -> but O is forbidden (from guess2).\n        DITSY: D, I, T, S, Y -> but that doesn\'t fit the pattern (we need second letter to be S, but in DITSY it\'s I in second).\n        We need: ? S I T ? \n        Possibilities: \n          USUAL: doesn\'t fit.\n          I can\'t think of many. Maybe ""SPITE"" but that is S in first, not second.\n\n  This seems difficult. \n\nNow, the third option: S in position 5.\n  Then the word: _ _ I _ S\n  And T can be in 1, 2, or 4.\n\n  If T in 1: T _ I _ S -> we need positions 2 and 4.\n    Examples: T?I?S -> \n      TRAIS -> not a word.\n      TWIGS: T, W, I, G, S -> that fits: T in 1, W in 2, I in 3, G in 4, S in 5. And W, G are allowed. \n      THIGS: not common.\n      TRIPS: R and P? R is forbidden (from guess1). \n      So TWIGS is a possibility.\n\n  If T in 2: _ T I _ S -> we need positions 1 and 4.\n    Examples: ?T I ? S -> \n      UTILS: U, T, I, L, S -> fits: U in 1, T in 2, I in 3, L in 4, S in 5. \n      Also, UTILS is a valid word. \n      Other: STIRS: but S is in 5 and we have S in 1? But we are putting S in 5, so the first letter is not S. \n      Also, UTILS: U, T, I, L, S -> all letters allowed? U, T, I, L, S. Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,M,O. So U, T, I, L, S are all allowed.\n\n  If T in 4: _ _ I T S -> we need positions 1 and 2.\n    Examples: ? ? I T S -> \n      WAITS: W, A, I, T, S -> but A is forbidden.\n      FRITS: F, R, I, T, S -> R forbidden.\n      BLITS: B, L, I, T, S -> B and L allowed? Yes. BLITS is a word? It might be a variant of blitz? But blitz is 5 letters: B, L, I, T, Z -> not S. \n      So not many common words.\n\nSo from the above, we have a few candidate words:\n\n1. From S in position 1 and T in position 2: STI?? -> but we need two more letters. We considered STILL (but duplicate L) and STING (but N is forbidden) and STICK (C forbidden). Actually, we didn\'t find a good one without forbidden letters? \n\n   Earlier I thought of STILL: S, T, I, L, L -> but duplicate L. But is that acceptable? The game allows duplicate letters. And we haven\'t ruled out L. So STILL is a candidate.\n\n2. From S in position 1 and T in position 4: we had SLITS, SPITS, SKITS. \n   SLITS: S, L, I, T, S -> duplicate S. \n   SPITS: S, P, I, T, S -> duplicate S.\n   SKITS: S, K, I, T, S -> duplicate S.\n\n3. From S in position 5 and T in position 1: TWIGS: T, W, I, G, S -> no duplicates, and W, G are allowed.\n\n4. From S in position 5 and T in position 2: UTILS: U, T, I, L, S -> no duplicates.\n\nWe also have the constraint that in the feedback for ""moist"", S was present but not in position 4, and T was present but not in position 5. \n\nIn the candidate words:\n\n- For STILL: \n  - S is in position 1 -> not 4, so okay.\n  - T is in position 2 -> not 5, so okay.\n  - But we have duplicate L? The secret word might have duplicate letters. We don\'t know.\n\n- For SLITS (or SPITS, SKITS): \n  - S is in position 1 and 5 -> so one of the S\'s is in position 1 (which is not 4) and the other in 5 (which is not 4) so that\'s okay for S. \n  - T is in position 4 -> not 5, so okay.\n\n- For TWIGS:\n  - T is in position 1 -> not 5, okay.\n  - S is in position 5 -> not 4, okay.\n\n- For UTILS:\n  - T is in position 2 -> not 5, okay.\n  - S is in position 5 -> not 4, okay.\n\nWe need to choose one that is a valid word and tests new letters.\n\nWe also want to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.\n\nLet\'s list the letters we have already tried: \nFrom guess1: C, R, A, N, E\nFrom guess2: M, O, I, S, T\n\nSo we have tried: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T.\n\nWe haven\'t tried: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nIn the candidates:\n\n- STILL: uses S, T, I, L -> but we have already tried S, T, I, and L is new. So it only introduces one new letter (L) and we have duplicate L.\n\n- SLITS: uses S, L, I, T -> same as above, but with duplicate S. Also, only one new letter L.\n\n- TWIGS: uses T, W, I, G, S -> we have T, I, S already, and W and G are new. So two new letters.\n\n- UTILS: uses U, T, I, L, S -> T, I, S already, and U and L are new. So two new letters.\n\nSo TWIGS and UTILS introduce two new letters each, which is better.\n\nBetween TWIGS and UTILS, which one to choose?\n\nWe can also consider other words that fit the pattern and introduce more new letters.\n\nBut let\'s see if there are words that use even more new letters? We have to fill the positions.\n\nAnother possibility: what if we put S in position 5 and T in position 4? Then we have _ _ I T S. We need two letters at the beginning. We thought of BLITS? But that might not be common. Other words: \n  DUITS -> not common.\n  FRITS: F, R, I, T, S -> R forbidden.\n  GRITS: G, R, I, T, S -> R forbidden.\n  HITS: too short.\n  QUITS: Q, U, I, T, S -> but we have I in third? QUITS: Q, U, I, T, S -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:T, 5:S -> that fits! And Q, U are new, and we avoid forbidden letters. \n  So QUITS: Q, U, I, T, S -> all allowed? Q, U, I, T, S. Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,M,O. So yes.\n\nSo QUITS is a candidate. It has:\n- T in position 4 -> not 5, okay.\n- S in position 5 -> not 4, okay.\n- New letters: Q, U (and we already know I, T, S).\n\nSo it introduces two new letters: Q and U.\n\nNow we have:\n- TWIGS: T, W, I, G, S -> new letters: W, G\n- UTILS: U, T, I, L, S -> new letters: U, L\n- QUITS: Q, U, I, T, S -> new letters: Q, U\n\nWe want to maximize information, so we should choose a word that uses common letters or at least covers more possibilities.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on the third guess. We want to get as much information as possible.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t necessarily put I in the third position? But wait, we know that I is in the third position, so we must have I in the third position. So we cannot avoid that.\n\nSo we must have I in the third position.\n\nNow, among the candidates, which one is the best?\n\nWe can also consider if there is a word that has S and T in the allowed positions and also includes more than two new letters? But we only have two positions to fill (if we fix I, S, and T) then we have two positions left, so at most two new letters.\n\nBut note: in the case of duplicates, we might have only one new letter (like in STILL, we have two L\'s, so only one new letter L).\n\nSo the candidates with two new letters are better.\n\nNow, among TWIGS, UTILS, QUITS, which one?\n\nLet\'s see the letter frequency in English to choose the most common letters.\n\nCommon letters that we haven\'t tried: \nWe haven\'t tried: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nThe most common of these are: L, D, U, P, F, G, W, etc. (according to general English frequency).\n\nBut note: we are in a 5-letter word context.\n\nCommon letters in 5-letter words: we can look for frequent ones.\n\nBut without a list, we can use general knowledge: L, D, H, G, U, P, etc.\n\nIn TWIGS: we have G and W. G is fairly common, W is less common.\nIn UTILS: we have U and L. L is very common, U is less common.\nIn QUITS: we have Q and U. Q is very rare, U is less common.\n\nSo UTILS has L, which is a common letter, and U. TWIGS has G and W. QUITS has Q and U.\n\nSo UTILS and TWIGS might be better than QUITS because Q is rare.\n\nBetween UTILS and TWIGS, UTILS has L (which is more common than G and W) and U (which is about as common as U in UTILS and W in TWIGS?).\n\nBut note: in UTILS, we have U and L, and in TWIGS, we have W and G.\n\nLetter frequency in English: \nL is about 4% of letters, G is about 2%, W is about 2%, U is about 2.5%. So L is the most common.\n\nTherefore, UTILS might be better because it includes L, which is a high-frequency letter.\n\nBut we also have to consider the word structure.\n\nAnother candidate: what about ""BUILT""? But we need S. We know the word must contain S. So we cannot omit S.\n\nSimilarly, we must have T.\n\nSo we must include both S and T.\n\nAnother word: if we put S in position 5 and T in position 1, we had TWIGS. What about ""TOWIS""? Not a word.\n\nOr ""DAISY"": but A is forbidden.\n\nSo let\'s go with UTILS.\n\nBut wait, in UTILS, the T is in position 2 and S in position 5. We know T is present and not in 5 (which is satisfied) and S is present and not in 4 (satisfied because it\'s in 5).\n\nAlso, the third letter is I, which is correct.\n\nSo UTILS: U, T, I, L, S.\n\nWe can also consider ""SULTI""? Not a word.\n\nOr ""STILT"": but that has S in 1 and T in 5? STILT: S, T, I, L, T -> duplicate T? And T is in position 5, which is not allowed (because T cannot be in position 5). So invalid.\n\nTherefore, I think UTILS is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: \n- U: not tried before -> if it\'s in the word, we\'ll know.\n- T: we know it\'s in the word, but we are putting it in position 2. If it\'s not in position 2, we\'ll get a \'-\' for T (present but wrong position) or if it is in position 2, we get a check.\n- I: we know it\'s in position 3, so we expect a check.\n- L: new letter.\n- S: we know it\'s in the word, but we are putting it in position 5. If it\'s not in position 5, we get a \'-\'.\n\nSo we can get more information about the positions of T and S.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose TWIGS: \n- T in 1: if T is not in 1, we get \'-\' (but we know T is in the word, so it would be present but not in 1).\n- W: new.\n- I: check.\n- G: new.\n- S: in 5, if not in 5, then \'-\'.\n\nSimilarly, we get information about T and S positions.\n\nBut UTILS has the advantage of having L, which is more common.\n\nWe might also consider ""PULIS"" but P is available, but then we have to fit the pattern. PULIS: P, U, L, I, S -> but then the third letter is L, not I. We need the third letter to be I.\n\nSo no.\n\nAnother word: ""HILTS"": H, I, L, T, S -> but then the third letter is L, not I. We need the third letter to be I. So HILTS: positions: 1:H, 2:I, 3:L -> but we need position 3 to be I, so that doesn\'t work.\n\nSo I think UTILS is a solid choice.\n\nTherefore, we\'ll guess ""UTILS"".\n\nBut note: we must ensure that UTILS is a valid word. Yes, it is (meaning utilities or useful, or as a noun in some contexts).\n\nSo our next guess: UTILS.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x)**, so the secret word contains none of these letters.\n- **Guess 2: ""moist"" → Feedback: M(x), O(x), I(✓), S(-), T(-)**. This means:\n  - **I is correct and in position 3** (since it was the third letter in ""moist"").\n  - **S is present but not in position 4**.\n  - **T is present but not in position 5**.\n  - M and O are absent.\n\n### Key Constraints for the Next Guess:\n1. **Position 3 must be I**.\n2. **S must be included but not in position 4**.\n3. **T must be included but not in position 5**.\n4. **Avoid all letters from previous guesses**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O.\n5. **Available positions for S**: 1, 2, or 5 (since position 3 is I, and position 4 is invalid for S).\n6. **Available positions for T**: 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is I, and position 5 is invalid for T).\n\n### Analysis and Word Selection:\n- After evaluating possible words that fit the constraints (e.g., ""twigs"", ""utils"", ""quits""), **""utils""** was chosen because:\n  - It places **I in position 3** (required).\n  - It places **S in position 5** (valid, as S cannot be in position 4).\n  - It places **T in position 2** (valid, as T cannot be in position 5).\n  - It introduces **two new high-frequency letters (U and L)** to maximize information gain.\n  - It avoids all forbidden letters and is a valid English word (meaning useful items or functions).\n\nThis guess tests the positions of S and T while exploring new letters, helping to narrow down possibilities efficiently.\n\n<guess>utils</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(✓) S(-) T(-)\nGuess 3: utils -> FEEDBACK: U(x) T(✓) I(✓) L(✓) S(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the third guess ""utils"":
  U(x) -> absent
  T(✓) -> correct, so T is in the secret word and in position 2 (since T is the second letter in ""utils"")
  I(✓) -> correct, so I is in position 3 (as we already knew)
  L(✓) -> correct, so L is in the secret word and in position 4 (since L is the fourth letter in ""utils"")
  S(-) -> present, so S is in the word but not in position 5 (since S is the fifth letter in ""utils"")

So now we know:
- The secret word has the form: [letter1] T I L [letter5]
- The word contains S, but it is not in position 5. Since positions 2, 3, and 4 are taken by T, I, L, the only possible positions for S are 1 or ... but wait, position 1 is the only one left? 
  Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
  We have:
    Position 2: T
    Position 3: I
    Position 4: L
    Position 5: is unknown, but we know S is not in position 5 (because of the feedback for S: present but not in position 5). 
  Therefore, S must be in position 1? Because that's the only position left? But wait, we have two positions: 1 and 5. But position 5 cannot have S, so S must be in position 1.

However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence of duplicates so far. The feedback for S in ""utils"" is that it is present but not in position 5. Since position 5 is the only position we put S and it's not there, but it must be in the word, then it must be in position 1? But position 1 is currently occupied by U, which we now know is absent.

But wait: in ""utils"", we have U in position 1, which is absent. So the secret word does not have U. Therefore, position 1 is open and must be S? Because S must be somewhere, and the only positions left are 1 and 5. But S cannot be in 5, so it must be in 1.

Therefore, the secret word must start with S? So the word is S T I L [letter5]

But we also know that the word must have five letters, and we have four so far: S, T, I, L, and the fifth letter is unknown.

Now, what about the fifth letter? We know it cannot be any of the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, U (from the feedback of guess3: U is absent). Also, we have used S, T, I, L.

So the fifth letter must be a letter that is not in the forbidden list and not S, T, I, L? But wait, it could be a duplicate? But we don't have evidence for duplicates. However, we must consider the possibility.

But note: the feedback for S in ""utils"" was present but not in position 5. If the secret word has S in position 1, then that satisfies the presence of S. And the fifth letter is something else.

So the word is: S T I L ?

Now, we need to find a letter for the fifth position that forms a valid English word.

The forbidden letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, U.

We have used: S, T, I, L.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, what words fit the pattern ""STIL?""?

Common words:
- STILL: S, T, I, L, L -> but that would have two L's. The fifth letter is L. But we already have L in position 4. So if the word is STILL, then the feedback for ""utils"" would have shown L as present in two positions? But in ""utils"", we had L in position 4 and it was marked correct (✓). If the secret word has L in position 4 and also in position 5, then in ""utils"", the L in position 4 is correct, but the word has another L? The feedback doesn't mark duplicates unless they are in the word. In Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will show a ✓ or - for each occurrence if the letter is repeated in the guess. But in ""utils"", we only have one L (in position 4) and it was marked correct. If the secret word has two L's, then when we guess a word with one L, we only get one L marked (if it's in the correct position, it's ✓, and the duplicate in the secret word is not indicated if we don't guess it). So STILL is possible.

But let's check the feedback for ""utils"" if the secret word is STILL:
  U (position1): absent -> correct because STILL has S at position1, not U.
  T (position2): correct -> matches STILL (T in position2).
  I (position3): correct -> matches.
  L (position4): correct -> matches (the first L in STILL is at position4).
  S (position5): present but not in position5 -> but in STILL, the fifth letter is L, not S. And S is at position1. So the feedback for S in ""utils"" (position5) would be: the letter S is present (because the secret word has an S) but not in position5 (it's in position1). So that matches.

Therefore, STILL is a candidate.

But are there other words? 

Other possibilities for the fifth letter? 
- STILE: but E is forbidden.
- STILT: T is already in position2, and if we put T at the end, that would be duplicate T? STILT: S, T, I, L, T. But we have T in position2 and position5. But in the feedback for ""moist"", we had T marked as present but not in position5. If the secret word has T in position5, that would contradict because we were told T is not in position5. So STILT is invalid because it has T in position5, which is forbidden by the feedback from guess2.

- STILB: a unit of luminance? B is allowed. So STILB: S, T, I, L, B.
- STILD: not a word.
- STILK: not a word.
- STILL: as above.
- STILP: not a word.

So the only common words are STILL and STILB? But STILB is very obscure.

We also have STILL and perhaps STIMY? But STIMY: S, T, I, M, Y -> but M is forbidden.

So the most common word is STILL.

But we must consider: is there a word with a different letter? 

Another word: ""STILT"" is invalid because of T in position5.

What about ""STILE""? But E is forbidden.

So the only reasonable candidate is STILL.

But note: in STILL, the fifth letter is L, which is a duplicate of the fourth letter. We don't have any feedback that rules out duplicates, so it's possible.

Alternatively, could the secret word have S in a different position? We concluded S must be in position1 because it can't be in 5 and the other positions are taken. But what if the secret word has duplicate S? For example, could it be that S is in position1 and also in position5? But then in ""utils"", we have S in position5, and the feedback for that S would be: if the secret word has S in position5, then it would be marked correct (✓), but it was marked as present but not in position5 (-). So that means the secret word does not have S in position5. Therefore, if there is an S in the secret word, it must be in position1 (since positions 2,3,4 are taken by T, I, L). 

Therefore, the word must start with S. So the pattern is S T I L ?

And the fifth letter must be a letter that forms a valid word.

Given that, the only common word is STILL.

But let's confirm the feedback for ""utils"" if the secret word is STILL:
  U: absent -> correct (STILL has S at position1, not U)
  T: correct (position2: T matches)
  I: correct (position3: I matches)
  L: correct (position4: L matches)
  S: present but not in position5 -> because S is at position1, so it is present but not in position5 -> correct.

So it matches.

Therefore, we should guess STILL.

But note: we have only one guess left? We are on the fourth guess. We have 6 guesses total, so we can guess STILL.

But to be safe, we might consider if there are other possibilities. However, the pattern is fixed: positions 2,3,4 are T, I, L, and position1 must be S, so the only variable is position5.

And the only common word is STILL.

So we guess STILL.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x).  
- **Guess 2: ""moist""** → Feedback:  
  - M(x), O(x): Absent.  
  - I(✓): Correct and in position 3.  
  - S(-): Present but not in position 4.  
  - T(-): Present but not in position 5.  
- **Guess 3: ""utils""** → Feedback:  
  - U(x): Absent.  
  - T(✓): Correct and in position 2.  
  - I(✓): Correct and in position 3 (confirmed again).  
  - L(✓): Correct and in position 4.  
  - S(-): Present but not in position 5.  

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed Positions**:  
   - Position 2: **T** (from T(✓) in ""utils"").  
   - Position 3: **I** (from I(✓) in both ""moist"" and ""utils"").  
   - Position 4: **L** (from L(✓) in ""utils"").  
   - Thus, the word structure is: `[?] T I L [?]`.  

2. **S Must Be in Position 1**:  
   - S is present (from S(-) in ""moist"" and ""utils"") but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (per feedback).  
   - Positions 2, 3, and 4 are occupied by T, I, L, so S **must** be in position 1.  
   - The word starts with **S**: `S T I L [?]`.  

3. **Fifth Letter Constraints**:  
   - Must be a valid English letter not in the forbidden set: **C, R, A, N, E, M, O, U** (all marked absent).  
   - Cannot be **T, I, L, or S** (unless duplicates are allowed, but no evidence yet).  
   - Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

4. **Valid Word Options**:  
   - **STILL** (S, T, I, L, L): Common word, fits the pattern.  
     - Duplicate L is possible (feedback doesn't rule it out).  
     - Fifth letter = L, which is allowed since L is already confirmed in position 4.  
   - Other options like STILB (obscure) or STILT (invalid; T in position 5 conflicts with Guess 2 feedback) are unlikely.  

### Conclusion:
The only common English word fitting all constraints is **STILL**. It:
- Starts with S (required).
- Has T, I, L in positions 2, 3, 4 (confirmed).
- Uses L in position 5 (valid duplicate; no feedback against it).
- Avoids all forbidden letters.
