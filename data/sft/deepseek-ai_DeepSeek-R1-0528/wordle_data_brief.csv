We are making the first guess with no prior feedback. We want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained.
Common strategies for first guesses include using words with common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.

A good starting word might be ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"", but let's consider others. 
In this case, I remember that ""RAISE"" is a popular first guess because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

Alternatively, words like ""ROATE"" (a variant of ROATE) are sometimes used, but I think ""RAISE"" is fine.

However, note that the example used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"", so we should avoid those for the first guess.

I am going with ""CRATE"" because it covers common letters: C, R, A, T, E.

But let me check: 
- Letters: C, R, A, T, E. 
This gives us a good mix.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also good. 
But I'll choose ""CRATE"" for now.

Wait, I recall that ""SOARE"" is a bird and sometimes used, but might be too obscure? We want a valid English word.

After consideration, let's go with ""RAISE"" because it is often recommended.

However, the instructions don't give any previous feedback, so I have to choose one.

I choose: RAISE

Let me write it within the required tags.
</think>
For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by including common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. A strong starting word like ""RAISE"" is ideal because:
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E), which frequently appear in English words.
- It includes common consonants (R, S), increasing the chance of correct placements.
- It avoids repeated letters, allowing broader coverage of possible characters.

This approach helps narrow down possibilities efficiently regardless of the secret word.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: present but in the wrong position (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- I: correct position (✓)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: present but in the wrong position (-)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The letter 'I' is in the word and in the 3rd position (since it was correct in ""RAISE"" at position 3).
2. The letter 'R' is in the word but not in the 1st position.
3. The letter 'E' is in the word but not in the 5th position.
4. The letters 'A' and 'S' are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have 'I' in the 3rd position: _ _ I _ _
- Contains 'R' and 'E', but not in the 1st and 5th positions respectively (and also not in the positions they were guessed).
- Does not contain 'A' or 'S'.

We also know that the word is 5 letters and a valid English word.

Now, we need to make a second guess that incorporates this information.

Our goal is to test possible positions for 'R' and 'E' and also to include new letters to gather more information.

Constraints for the next guess:
- Avoid using 'A' and 'S' because they are not in the word.
- The 3rd letter must be 'I'.
- We must include 'R' and 'E' (since they are in the word) but in positions that are not ruled out.

Possible positions for 'R':
- It cannot be in the 1st position (because in the first guess it was in the 1st and was wrong). So it can be in 2nd, 4th, or 5th.

Possible positions for 'E':
- It cannot be in the 5th position (because in the first guess it was in the 5th and was wrong). So it can be in 1st, 2nd, or 4th.

But note: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

We also need to include three new letters (since we have to use 5 letters and we already know two: R and E, and one fixed: I in the middle). Actually, we have:
- Position 3 is fixed as 'I'.
- We must include 'R' and 'E' in the word, but in other positions (1,2,4,5) but with constraints.

We can try to form a word that has:
- 3rd letter: I
- Includes R and E in positions that are allowed (for R: not 1; for E: not 5).

Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible to get more information.

Let's think of words that fit this pattern.

We know the word does not have A or S, so we can avoid those.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover common consonants and vowels. We already have one vowel: I. The word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but common words often have vowels.

We have E in the word, which is a vowel.

So, we can try to use a word that has:
- Position 1: a new letter (but cannot be R because R cannot be in position 1) and cannot be A or S.
- Position 2: could be R, E, or a new letter.
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- Position 4: could be R, E, or a new letter.
- Position 5: could be R (since R can be in 5th) but not E (because E cannot be in 5th). So position 5 must be a new letter or R.

But note: E cannot be in position 5, so position 5 must be either R or a new letter.

Let me try to come up with candidate words.

We can try to put E in position 1 (which is allowed) and R in position 4, for example.

Word pattern: E _ I R ?

But we need a letter for position 2 and 5. And we must avoid A and S.

Example: ""EPIR?"" - but that doesn't form a word. Let me think.

How about ""ELITE""? But wait, we have two T's? Also, we have E in position 1 and 5? But we cannot have E in position 5 because the feedback said E is not in the 5th. So ""ELITE"" has E in 5th, which is not allowed.

We must avoid E in 5th.

Another idea: put E in position 2 and R in position 4.

Pattern: _ E I R ?

We need a consonant for position 1 and a letter for position 5 (which can be R? but R is already in 4th, so no, we can't use R twice unless the word has two R's? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. We should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

So, let's assume no duplicate letters for now.

Then, we have:
- Position 1: must be a new letter (not A, S, and not R, E, I because we are using them in other positions? Actually, we can use R and E only once, and I is fixed in the middle).
- Position 2: E (we are trying this)
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: a new letter.

So the pattern: ? E I R ?

What letters can we put in position 1 and 5? We need a valid word.

Possible words: 
- ""DEVIL"" has V and L, but the pattern would be D E V I L -> but we need I in 3rd, so that would be D E V I L -> positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:V -> but we need 3rd to be I, so that doesn't work.

We need the 3rd to be I, so the word must be: [letter1] E I [letter4] [letter5]

But we are putting R in position 4? So: [letter1] E I R [letter5]

Now, what words have this pattern? And avoid A and S.

Examples:
- ""FEIRY""? Not a word.
- ""HEIRD""? Not common, and it's HEIRD (meaning: a person who inherits) but it's 5 letters? H-E-I-R-D. That's a word? Let me check: Heird is not standard. Maybe ""HEIR"" is 4 letters.

Another: ""WEIRD"" -> W-E-I-R-D. That's a valid word.

So, ""WEIRD"" has:
- W in position 1 (new)
- E in position 2 (which is allowed because E can be in 2nd)
- I in position 3 (fixed)
- R in position 4 (allowed because R can be in 4th)
- D in position 5 (new)

And it avoids A and S.

This seems like a good candidate.

But note: we are not sure if R can be in 4th, but we are testing it.

Alternatively, we could put R in position 2 and E in position 1? But E in position 1 is allowed.

Pattern: E ? I ? ?

But then we have to place R somewhere (not position 1, so 2,4,5) but position 2 is free? Actually, we can do E R I ? ? -> but that would be ""ERI.."" and then we need two more letters.

Example: ""ERICA"" -> but has A, which is not allowed. Also, A is not in the word.

""ERICK"" is not a word.

""ERIKA"" has A and is 5 letters? But A is not allowed.

""ERINY"" -> Erinyes? Not 5 letters.

""ERICA"" is 5 but has A.

So that might be hard.

Another pattern: put E in position 4 and R in position 2.

Pattern: ? R I E ?

But then position 1 and 5 are new.

Example: ""CRIEP""? Not a word.

""TRIED"" -> T-R-I-E-D. That's a word.

""TRIED"":
- T in 1 (new)
- R in 2 (allowed because R can be in 2nd? But in the first guess, R was in 1st and was wrong, but 2nd is a new position and allowed)
- I in 3 (fixed)
- E in 4 (allowed because E can be in 4th? The constraint for E is not in 5th, so 4th is okay)
- D in 5 (new)

And avoids A and S.

So we have two candidates: ""WEIRD"" and ""TRIED"".

Both are valid.

But note: in ""TRIED"", we are putting R in position 2. We don't know if that is correct, but we are testing.

Similarly, in ""WEIRD"", we are putting E in 2 and R in 4.

Which one gives more information? Both use three new letters: for ""WEIRD"": W, E (in a new position), R (in a new position), and D. Actually, we already know E and R are in the word, so we are testing their positions. The new letters are W and D.

Similarly, in ""TRIED"": new letters are T and D.

We might get more information by choosing one that has more common letters? Or that covers more possibilities.

But both are similar.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't put both R and E in the same guess? But that might be inefficient because we have to test both.

We know they are in the word, so we should try to find their positions.

Another candidate: put R in position 5? Then we have to put E in position 1,2, or 4.

For example: ? ? I ? R

But we also have to include E.

Example: put E in position 1: E ? I ? R -> words: ""ELMIR""? Not a word. ""EXPIR""? Not a word.

Put E in position 2: ? E I ? R -> ""LEVIR""? Not common. ""DEVIR""? Not a word.

Put E in position 4: ? ? I E R -> ""CUTER"" but 3rd is U, not I. We need 3rd to be I: so [letter1] [letter2] I E R

Examples: ""OUIER""? Not a word. ""BAKER"" has A, not allowed. ""MAKER"" has A and M? But A is not allowed. ""TIMER"" -> T-I-M-E-R -> but 3rd is M, not I. 

""FIER?"" -> ""FIERY"" is 5 letters? F-I-E-R-Y -> but that would be positions: 1:F, 2:I, 3:E -> but we need 3rd to be I, so that doesn't work.

We need the 3rd to be I: so the word must be: [letter1] [letter2] I [letter4] R

And we also need to include E. So E must be in position 1,2, or 4? But position 4 is the fourth letter, which is after I.

So if we put E in position 4, then the word is [letter1] [letter2] I E R

What words? ""Crier"" has C and R? C-R-I-E-R -> but that's 5 letters? C-R-I-E-R is 5: positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:I, 4:E, 5:R -> but that has two R's? And we don't know if the word has duplicates. Also, we are using R twice? But we don't know if R appears twice.

But let's avoid duplicates for now.

So, without duplicates, we need [letter1] [letter2] I E R, and [letter1] and [letter2] are not R, E, I (but I is in 3rd, so they can be other letters).

But we also have to avoid A and S.

Examples: ""BRIER"" has two R's. ""PLIER"" -> P-L-I-E-R: that's a word. And it has no duplicates? P, L, I, E, R -> all distinct.

But note: in ""PLIER"", we have:
- P (new)
- L (new)
- I (fixed)
- E (in position 4, which is allowed)
- R (in position 5, which is allowed for R because R can be in 5th)

But we have to check if E in position 4 is allowed? Yes, because the constraint for E is not in 5th, so 4th is okay.

Similarly, R in 5th is okay.

So ""PLIER"" is a candidate.

Now we have three candidates: ""WEIRD"", ""TRIED"", and ""PLIER"".

Which one to choose?

We want to maximize the information about the positions of R and E, and also test new letters.

In ""WEIRD"": 
- We are testing E in position 2 and R in position 4.
- New letters: W and D.

In ""TRIED"":
- Testing R in position 2 and E in position 4.
- New letters: T and D.

In ""PLIER"":
- Testing E in position 4 and R in position 5.
- New letters: P, L, and no D? Actually, all are new except I, E, R.

But we already know E and R are in the word, so we are testing their positions.

""PLIER"" uses two new letters: P and L.

Now, which one is better? 

Note that in the first feedback, we have R and E in the word but not in the positions we guessed. We guessed R in 1st and E in 5th, and they were wrong.

Now, we are trying different positions.

We might also consider that the word might have more vowels? But we have I and E, which are vowels, so it might be enough.

I think ""TRIED"" is a good choice because:
- It uses common letters.
- It tests R in position 2 and E in position 4.

Similarly, ""WEIRD"" is also good.

But let me see if there is a word that tests only one of them? But we have to include both because they are in the word.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has E and R but also includes other common letters to get more information.

Another candidate: ""URINE"" -> but has U and N, and E in 5th? But E cannot be in 5th. So not allowed.

""OPINE"" -> O-P-I-N-E: but E is in 5th, not allowed.

""ADIEU"" -> has A and E in 4th? But A is not allowed.

So, back to the candidates.

I think ""TRIED"" is a solid choice.

So I'll go with ""TRIED"".

But let's confirm the pattern: T-R-I-E-D
- T: new
- R: in position 2 (we are testing if R is in 2nd)
- I: correct (fixed)
- E: in position 4 (testing if E is in 4th)
- D: new

This will give us feedback on:
- If R is in 2nd, we get a check or a minus.
- If E is in 4th, we get a check or a minus.
- And we learn about T and D.

If we get minuses, we know that R is not in 2nd and E is not in 4th, so they must be in other positions.

For example, if R is not in 2nd, then it must be in 4th or 5th (since not 1st and not 3rd because 3rd is I). Similarly, if E is not in 4th, then it must be in 1st or 2nd.

So we can narrow down.

Therefore, I choose ""TRIED"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is in the word but not in the 1st position (-).
- A is not in the word (x).
- I is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓).
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-).

Key insights:
- The secret word has 'I' in the 3rd position (e.g., _ _ I _ _).
- The word contains 'R' and 'E', but 'R' cannot be in the 1st position, and 'E' cannot be in the 5th position.
- 'A' and 'S' are absent, so they are excluded from the next guess.
- Possible positions for 'R': 2nd, 4th, or 5th.
- Possible positions for 'E': 1st, 2nd, or 4th.

For the second guess, I chose ""TRIED"" because:
- It includes 'R' and 'E' (required letters) in testable positions: 'R' in 2nd position and 'E' in 4th position.
- It avoids 'A' and 'S' (excluded letters).
- It introduces two new common letters ('T' and 'D') to gather more information.
- The 3rd position is 'I' (fixed from feedback).
- If 'R' or 'E' are misplaced, the feedback will help narrow their positions (e.g., if 'R' is not in 2nd, it must be in 4th or 5th; if 'E' is not in 4th, it must be in 1st or 2nd).

<guess>TRIED</guess>",TRIED,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: present but in the wrong position (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- I: correct position (✓)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: present but in the wrong position (-)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The letter 'I' is in the word and in the 3rd position (since it was correct in ""RAISE"" at position 3).
2. The letter 'R' is in the word but not in the 1st position.
3. The letter 'E' is in the word but not in the 5th position.
4. The letters 'A' and 'S' are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have 'I' in the 3rd position: _ _ I _ _
- Contains 'R' and 'E', but not in the 1st and 5th positions respectively (and also not in the positions they were guessed).
- Does not contain 'A' or 'S'.

We also know that the word is 5 letters and a valid English word.

Now, we need to make a second guess that incorporates this information.

Our goal is to test possible positions for 'R' and 'E' and also to include new letters to gather more information.

Constraints for the next guess:
- Avoid using 'A' and 'S' because they are not in the word.
- The 3rd letter must be 'I'.
- We must include 'R' and 'E' (since they are in the word) but in positions that are not ruled out.

Possible positions for 'R':
- It cannot be in the 1st position (because in the first guess it was in the 1st and was wrong). So it can be in 2nd, 4th, or 5th.

Possible positions for 'E':
- It cannot be in the 5th position (because in the first guess it was in the 5th and was wrong). So it can be in 1st, 2nd, or 4th.

But note: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

We also need to include three new letters (since we have to use 5 letters and we already know two: R and E, and one fixed: I in the middle). Actually, we have:
- Position 3 is fixed as 'I'.
- We must include 'R' and 'E' in the word, but in other positions (1,2,4,5) but with constraints.

We can try to form a word that has:
- 3rd letter: I
- Includes R and E in positions that are allowed (for R: not 1; for E: not 5).

Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible to get more information.

Let's think of words that fit this pattern.

We know the word does not have A or S, so we can avoid those.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover common consonants and vowels. We already have one vowel: I. The word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but common words often have vowels.

We have E in the word, which is a vowel.

So, we can try to use a word that has:
- Position 1: a new letter (but cannot be R because R cannot be in position 1) and cannot be A or S.
- Position 2: could be R, E, or a new letter.
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- Position 4: could be R, E, or a new letter.
- Position 5: could be R (since R can be in 5th) but not E (because E cannot be in 5th). So position 5 must be a new letter or R.

But note: E cannot be in position 5, so position 5 must be either R or a new letter.

Let me try to come up with candidate words.

We can try to put E in position 1 (which is allowed) and R in position 4, for example.

Word pattern: E _ I R ?

But we need a letter for position 2 and 5. And we must avoid A and S.

Example: ""EPIR?"" - but that doesn't form a word. Let me think.

How about ""ELITE""? But wait, we have two T's? Also, we have E in position 1 and 5? But we cannot have E in position 5 because the feedback said E is not in the 5th. So ""ELITE"" has E in 5th, which is not allowed.

We must avoid E in 5th.

Another idea: put E in position 2 and R in position 4.

Pattern: _ E I R ?

We need a consonant for position 1 and a letter for position 5 (which can be R? but R is already in 4th, so no, we can't use R twice unless the word has two R's? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. We should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

So, let's assume no duplicate letters for now.

Then, we have:
- Position 1: must be a new letter (not A, S, and not R, E, I because we are using them in other positions? Actually, we can use R and E only once, and I is fixed in the middle).
- Position 2: E (we are trying this)
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: a new letter.

So the pattern: ? E I R ?

What letters can we put in position 1 and 5? We need a valid word.

Possible words: 
- ""DEVIL"" has V and L, but the pattern would be D E V I L -> but we need I in 3rd, so that would be D E V I L -> positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:V -> but we need 3rd to be I, so that doesn't work.

We need the 3rd to be I, so the word must be: [letter1] E I [letter4] [letter5]

But we are putting R in position 4? So: [letter1] E I R [letter5]

Now, what words have this pattern? And avoid A and S.

Examples:
- ""FEIRY""? Not a word.
- ""HEIRD""? Not common, and it's HEIRD (meaning: a person who inherits) but it's 5 letters? H-E-I-R-D. That's a word? Let me check: Heird is not standard. Maybe ""HEIR"" is 4 letters.

Another: ""WEIRD"" -> W-E-I-R-D. That's a valid word.

So, ""WEIRD"" has:
- W in position 1 (new)
- E in position 2 (which is allowed because E can be in 2nd)
- I in position 3 (fixed)
- R in position 4 (allowed because R can be in 4th)
- D in position 5 (new)

And it avoids A and S.

This seems like a good candidate.

But note: we are not sure if R can be in 4th, but we are testing it.

Alternatively, we could put R in position 2 and E in position 1? But E in position 1 is allowed.

Pattern: E ? I ? ?

But then we have to place R somewhere (not position 1, so 2,4,5) but position 2 is free? Actually, we can do E R I ? ? -> but that would be ""ERI.."" and then we need two more letters.

Example: ""ERICA"" -> but has A, which is not allowed. Also, A is not in the word.

""ERICK"" is not a word.

""ERIKA"" has A and is 5 letters? But A is not allowed.

""ERINY"" -> Erinyes? Not 5 letters.

""ERICA"" is 5 but has A.

So that might be hard.

Another pattern: put E in position 4 and R in position 2.

Pattern: ? R I E ?

But then position 1 and 5 are new.

Example: ""CRIEP""? Not a word.

""TRIED"" -> T-R-I-E-D. That's a word.

""TRIED"":
- T in 1 (new)
- R in 2 (allowed because R can be in 2nd? But in the first guess, R was in 1st and was wrong, but 2nd is a new position and allowed)
- I in 3 (fixed)
- E in 4 (allowed because E can be in 4th? The constraint for E is not in 5th, so 4th is okay)
- D in 5 (new)

And avoids A and S.

So we have two candidates: ""WEIRD"" and ""TRIED"".

Both are valid.

But note: in ""TRIED"", we are putting R in position 2. We don't know if that is correct, but we are testing.

Similarly, in ""WEIRD"", we are putting E in 2 and R in 4.

Which one gives more information? Both use three new letters: for ""WEIRD"": W, E (in a new position), R (in a new position), and D. Actually, we already know E and R are in the word, so we are testing their positions. The new letters are W and D.

Similarly, in ""TRIED"": new letters are T and D.

We might get more information by choosing one that has more common letters? Or that covers more possibilities.

But both are similar.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't put both R and E in the same guess? But that might be inefficient because we have to test both.

We know they are in the word, so we should try to find their positions.

Another candidate: put R in position 5? Then we have to put E in position 1,2, or 4.

For example: ? ? I ? R

But we also have to include E.

Example: put E in position 1: E ? I ? R -> words: ""ELMIR""? Not a word. ""EXPIR""? Not a word.

Put E in position 2: ? E I ? R -> ""LEVIR""? Not common. ""DEVIR""? Not a word.

Put E in position 4: ? ? I E R -> ""CUTER"" but 3rd is U, not I. We need 3rd to be I: so [letter1] [letter2] I E R

Examples: ""OUIER""? Not a word. ""BAKER"" has A, not allowed. ""MAKER"" has A and M? But A is not allowed. ""TIMER"" -> T-I-M-E-R -> but 3rd is M, not I. 

""FIER?"" -> ""FIERY"" is 5 letters? F-I-E-R-Y -> but that would be positions: 1:F, 2:I, 3:E -> but we need 3rd to be I, so that doesn't work.

We need the 3rd to be I: so the word must be: [letter1] [letter2] I [letter4] R

And we also need to include E. So E must be in position 1,2, or 4? But position 4 is the fourth letter, which is after I.

So if we put E in position 4, then the word is [letter1] [letter2] I E R

What words? ""Crier"" has C and R? C-R-I-E-R -> but that's 5 letters? C-R-I-E-R is 5: positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:I, 4:E, 5:R -> but that has two R's? And we don't know if the word has duplicates. Also, we are using R twice? But we don't know if R appears twice.

But let's avoid duplicates for now.

So, without duplicates, we need [letter1] [letter2] I E R, and [letter1] and [letter2] are not R, E, I (but I is in 3rd, so they can be other letters).

But we also have to avoid A and S.

Examples: ""BRIER"" has two R's. ""PLIER"" -> P-L-I-E-R: that's a word. And it has no duplicates? P, L, I, E, R -> all distinct.

But note: in ""PLIER"", we have:
- P (new)
- L (new)
- I (fixed)
- E (in position 4, which is allowed)
- R (in position 5, which is allowed for R because R can be in 5th)

But we have to check if E in position 4 is allowed? Yes, because the constraint for E is not in 5th, so 4th is okay.

Similarly, R in 5th is okay.

So ""PLIER"" is a candidate.

Now we have three candidates: ""WEIRD"", ""TRIED"", and ""PLIER"".

Which one to choose?

We want to maximize the information about the positions of R and E, and also test new letters.

In ""WEIRD"": 
- We are testing E in position 2 and R in position 4.
- New letters: W and D.

In ""TRIED"":
- Testing R in position 2 and E in position 4.
- New letters: T and D.

In ""PLIER"":
- Testing E in position 4 and R in position 5.
- New letters: P, L, and no D? Actually, all are new except I, E, R.

But we already know E and R are in the word, so we are testing their positions.

""PLIER"" uses two new letters: P and L.

Now, which one is better? 

Note that in the first feedback, we have R and E in the word but not in the positions we guessed. We guessed R in 1st and E in 5th, and they were wrong.

Now, we are trying different positions.

We might also consider that the word might have more vowels? But we have I and E, which are vowels, so it might be enough.

I think ""TRIED"" is a good choice because:
- It uses common letters.
- It tests R in position 2 and E in position 4.

Similarly, ""WEIRD"" is also good.

But let me see if there is a word that tests only one of them? But we have to include both because they are in the word.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has E and R but also includes other common letters to get more information.

Another candidate: ""URINE"" -> but has U and N, and E in 5th? But E cannot be in 5th. So not allowed.

""OPINE"" -> O-P-I-N-E: but E is in 5th, not allowed.

""ADIEU"" -> has A and E in 4th? But A is not allowed.

So, back to the candidates.

I think ""TRIED"" is a solid choice.

So I'll go with ""TRIED"".

But let's confirm the pattern: T-R-I-E-D
- T: new
- R: in position 2 (we are testing if R is in 2nd)
- I: correct (fixed)
- E: in position 4 (testing if E is in 4th)
- D: new

This will give us feedback on:
- If R is in 2nd, we get a check or a minus.
- If E is in 4th, we get a check or a minus.
- And we learn about T and D.

If we get minuses, we know that R is not in 2nd and E is not in 4th, so they must be in other positions.

For example, if R is not in 2nd, then it must be in 4th or 5th (since not 1st and not 3rd because 3rd is I). Similarly, if E is not in 4th, then it must be in 1st or 2nd.

So we can narrow down.

Therefore, I choose ""TRIED"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is in the word but not in the 1st position (-).
- A is not in the word (x).
- I is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓).
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-).

Key insights:
- The secret word has 'I' in the 3rd position (e.g., _ _ I _ _).
- The word contains 'R' and 'E', but 'R' cannot be in the 1st position, and 'E' cannot be in the 5th position.
- 'A' and 'S' are absent, so they are excluded from the next guess.
- Possible positions for 'R': 2nd, 4th, or 5th.
- Possible positions for 'E': 1st, 2nd, or 4th.

For the second guess, I chose ""TRIED"" because:
- It includes 'R' and 'E' (required letters) in testable positions: 'R' in 2nd position and 'E' in 4th position.
- It avoids 'A' and 'S' (excluded letters).
- It introduces two new common letters ('T' and 'D') to gather more information.
- The 3rd position is 'I' (fixed from feedback).
- If 'R' or 'E' are misplaced, the feedback will help narrow their positions (e.g., if 'R' is not in 2nd, it must be in 4th or 5th; if 'E' is not in 4th, it must be in 1st or 2nd).",Guess 2: TRIED -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(✓) E(✓) D(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess with no prior feedback. We want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained.
Common strategies for first guesses include using words with common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.

A good starting word might be ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"", but let's consider others. 
In this case, I remember that ""RAISE"" is a popular first guess because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

Alternatively, words like ""ROATE"" (a variant of ROATE) are sometimes used, but I think ""RAISE"" is fine.

However, note that the example used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"", so we should avoid those for the first guess.

I am going with ""CRATE"" because it covers common letters: C, R, A, T, E.

But let me check: 
- Letters: C, R, A, T, E. 
This gives us a good mix.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also good. 
But I'll choose ""CRATE"" for now.

Wait, I recall that ""SOARE"" is a bird and sometimes used, but might be too obscure? We want a valid English word.

After consideration, let's go with ""RAISE"" because it is often recommended.

However, the instructions don't give any previous feedback, so I have to choose one.

I choose: RAISE

Let me write it within the required tags.For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by including common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. A strong starting word like ""RAISE"" is ideal because:
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E), which frequently appear in English words.
- It includes common consonants (R, S), increasing the chance of correct placements.
- It avoids repeated letters, allowing broader coverage of possible characters.

This approach helps narrow down possibilities efficiently regardless of the secret word.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: present but in the wrong position (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- I: correct position (✓)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: present but in the wrong position (-)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The letter 'I' is in the word and in the 3rd position (since it was correct in ""RAISE"" at position 3).
2. The letter 'R' is in the word but not in the 1st position.
3. The letter 'E' is in the word but not in the 5th position.
4. The letters 'A' and 'S' are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have 'I' in the 3rd position: _ _ I _ _
- Contains 'R' and 'E', but not in the 1st and 5th positions respectively (and also not in the positions they were guessed).
- Does not contain 'A' or 'S'.

We also know that the word is 5 letters and a valid English word.

Now, we need to make a second guess that incorporates this information.

Our goal is to test possible positions for 'R' and 'E' and also to include new letters to gather more information.

Constraints for the next guess:
- Avoid using 'A' and 'S' because they are not in the word.
- The 3rd letter must be 'I'.
- We must include 'R' and 'E' (since they are in the word) but in positions that are not ruled out.

Possible positions for 'R':
- It cannot be in the 1st position (because in the first guess it was in the 1st and was wrong). So it can be in 2nd, 4th, or 5th.

Possible positions for 'E':
- It cannot be in the 5th position (because in the first guess it was in the 5th and was wrong). So it can be in 1st, 2nd, or 4th.

But note: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

We also need to include three new letters (since we have to use 5 letters and we already know two: R and E, and one fixed: I in the middle). Actually, we have:
- Position 3 is fixed as 'I'.
- We must include 'R' and 'E' in the word, but in other positions (1,2,4,5) but with constraints.

We can try to form a word that has:
- 3rd letter: I
- Includes R and E in positions that are allowed (for R: not 1; for E: not 5).

Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible to get more information.

Let's think of words that fit this pattern.

We know the word does not have A or S, so we can avoid those.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover common consonants and vowels. We already have one vowel: I. The word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but common words often have vowels.

We have E in the word, which is a vowel.

So, we can try to use a word that has:
- Position 1: a new letter (but cannot be R because R cannot be in position 1) and cannot be A or S.
- Position 2: could be R, E, or a new letter.
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- Position 4: could be R, E, or a new letter.
- Position 5: could be R (since R can be in 5th) but not E (because E cannot be in 5th). So position 5 must be a new letter or R.

But note: E cannot be in position 5, so position 5 must be either R or a new letter.

Let me try to come up with candidate words.

We can try to put E in position 1 (which is allowed) and R in position 4, for example.

Word pattern: E _ I R ?

But we need a letter for position 2 and 5. And we must avoid A and S.

Example: ""EPIR?"" - but that doesn't form a word. Let me think.

How about ""ELITE""? But wait, we have two T's? Also, we have E in position 1 and 5? But we cannot have E in position 5 because the feedback said E is not in the 5th. So ""ELITE"" has E in 5th, which is not allowed.

We must avoid E in 5th.

Another idea: put E in position 2 and R in position 4.

Pattern: _ E I R ?

We need a consonant for position 1 and a letter for position 5 (which can be R? but R is already in 4th, so no, we can't use R twice unless the word has two R's? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. We should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

So, let's assume no duplicate letters for now.

Then, we have:
- Position 1: must be a new letter (not A, S, and not R, E, I because we are using them in other positions? Actually, we can use R and E only once, and I is fixed in the middle).
- Position 2: E (we are trying this)
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: a new letter.

So the pattern: ? E I R ?

What letters can we put in position 1 and 5? We need a valid word.

Possible words: 
- ""DEVIL"" has V and L, but the pattern would be D E V I L -> but we need I in 3rd, so that would be D E V I L -> positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:V -> but we need 3rd to be I, so that doesn't work.

We need the 3rd to be I, so the word must be: [letter1] E I [letter4] [letter5]

But we are putting R in position 4? So: [letter1] E I R [letter5]

Now, what words have this pattern? And avoid A and S.

Examples:
- ""FEIRY""? Not a word.
- ""HEIRD""? Not common, and it's HEIRD (meaning: a person who inherits) but it's 5 letters? H-E-I-R-D. That's a word? Let me check: Heird is not standard. Maybe ""HEIR"" is 4 letters.

Another: ""WEIRD"" -> W-E-I-R-D. That's a valid word.

So, ""WEIRD"" has:
- W in position 1 (new)
- E in position 2 (which is allowed because E can be in 2nd)
- I in position 3 (fixed)
- R in position 4 (allowed because R can be in 4th)
- D in position 5 (new)

And it avoids A and S.

This seems like a good candidate.

But note: we are not sure if R can be in 4th, but we are testing it.

Alternatively, we could put R in position 2 and E in position 1? But E in position 1 is allowed.

Pattern: E ? I ? ?

But then we have to place R somewhere (not position 1, so 2,4,5) but position 2 is free? Actually, we can do E R I ? ? -> but that would be ""ERI.."" and then we need two more letters.

Example: ""ERICA"" -> but has A, which is not allowed. Also, A is not in the word.

""ERICK"" is not a word.

""ERIKA"" has A and is 5 letters? But A is not allowed.

""ERINY"" -> Erinyes? Not 5 letters.

""ERICA"" is 5 but has A.

So that might be hard.

Another pattern: put E in position 4 and R in position 2.

Pattern: ? R I E ?

But then position 1 and 5 are new.

Example: ""CRIEP""? Not a word.

""TRIED"" -> T-R-I-E-D. That's a word.

""TRIED"":
- T in 1 (new)
- R in 2 (allowed because R can be in 2nd? But in the first guess, R was in 1st and was wrong, but 2nd is a new position and allowed)
- I in 3 (fixed)
- E in 4 (allowed because E can be in 4th? The constraint for E is not in 5th, so 4th is okay)
- D in 5 (new)

And avoids A and S.

So we have two candidates: ""WEIRD"" and ""TRIED"".

Both are valid.

But note: in ""TRIED"", we are putting R in position 2. We don't know if that is correct, but we are testing.

Similarly, in ""WEIRD"", we are putting E in 2 and R in 4.

Which one gives more information? Both use three new letters: for ""WEIRD"": W, E (in a new position), R (in a new position), and D. Actually, we already know E and R are in the word, so we are testing their positions. The new letters are W and D.

Similarly, in ""TRIED"": new letters are T and D.

We might get more information by choosing one that has more common letters? Or that covers more possibilities.

But both are similar.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't put both R and E in the same guess? But that might be inefficient because we have to test both.

We know they are in the word, so we should try to find their positions.

Another candidate: put R in position 5? Then we have to put E in position 1,2, or 4.

For example: ? ? I ? R

But we also have to include E.

Example: put E in position 1: E ? I ? R -> words: ""ELMIR""? Not a word. ""EXPIR""? Not a word.

Put E in position 2: ? E I ? R -> ""LEVIR""? Not common. ""DEVIR""? Not a word.

Put E in position 4: ? ? I E R -> ""CUTER"" but 3rd is U, not I. We need 3rd to be I: so [letter1] [letter2] I E R

Examples: ""OUIER""? Not a word. ""BAKER"" has A, not allowed. ""MAKER"" has A and M? But A is not allowed. ""TIMER"" -> T-I-M-E-R -> but 3rd is M, not I. 

""FIER?"" -> ""FIERY"" is 5 letters? F-I-E-R-Y -> but that would be positions: 1:F, 2:I, 3:E -> but we need 3rd to be I, so that doesn't work.

We need the 3rd to be I: so the word must be: [letter1] [letter2] I [letter4] R

And we also need to include E. So E must be in position 1,2, or 4? But position 4 is the fourth letter, which is after I.

So if we put E in position 4, then the word is [letter1] [letter2] I E R

What words? ""Crier"" has C and R? C-R-I-E-R -> but that's 5 letters? C-R-I-E-R is 5: positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:I, 4:E, 5:R -> but that has two R's? And we don't know if the word has duplicates. Also, we are using R twice? But we don't know if R appears twice.

But let's avoid duplicates for now.

So, without duplicates, we need [letter1] [letter2] I E R, and [letter1] and [letter2] are not R, E, I (but I is in 3rd, so they can be other letters).

But we also have to avoid A and S.

Examples: ""BRIER"" has two R's. ""PLIER"" -> P-L-I-E-R: that's a word. And it has no duplicates? P, L, I, E, R -> all distinct.

But note: in ""PLIER"", we have:
- P (new)
- L (new)
- I (fixed)
- E (in position 4, which is allowed)
- R (in position 5, which is allowed for R because R can be in 5th)

But we have to check if E in position 4 is allowed? Yes, because the constraint for E is not in 5th, so 4th is okay.

Similarly, R in 5th is okay.

So ""PLIER"" is a candidate.

Now we have three candidates: ""WEIRD"", ""TRIED"", and ""PLIER"".

Which one to choose?

We want to maximize the information about the positions of R and E, and also test new letters.

In ""WEIRD"": 
- We are testing E in position 2 and R in position 4.
- New letters: W and D.

In ""TRIED"":
- Testing R in position 2 and E in position 4.
- New letters: T and D.

In ""PLIER"":
- Testing E in position 4 and R in position 5.
- New letters: P, L, and no D? Actually, all are new except I, E, R.

But we already know E and R are in the word, so we are testing their positions.

""PLIER"" uses two new letters: P and L.

Now, which one is better? 

Note that in the first feedback, we have R and E in the word but not in the positions we guessed. We guessed R in 1st and E in 5th, and they were wrong.

Now, we are trying different positions.

We might also consider that the word might have more vowels? But we have I and E, which are vowels, so it might be enough.

I think ""TRIED"" is a good choice because:
- It uses common letters.
- It tests R in position 2 and E in position 4.

Similarly, ""WEIRD"" is also good.

But let me see if there is a word that tests only one of them? But we have to include both because they are in the word.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has E and R but also includes other common letters to get more information.

Another candidate: ""URINE"" -> but has U and N, and E in 5th? But E cannot be in 5th. So not allowed.

""OPINE"" -> O-P-I-N-E: but E is in 5th, not allowed.

""ADIEU"" -> has A and E in 4th? But A is not allowed.

So, back to the candidates.

I think ""TRIED"" is a solid choice.

So I'll go with ""TRIED"".

But let's confirm the pattern: T-R-I-E-D
- T: new
- R: in position 2 (we are testing if R is in 2nd)
- I: correct (fixed)
- E: in position 4 (testing if E is in 4th)
- D: new

This will give us feedback on:
- If R is in 2nd, we get a check or a minus.
- If E is in 4th, we get a check or a minus.
- And we learn about T and D.

If we get minuses, we know that R is not in 2nd and E is not in 4th, so they must be in other positions.

For example, if R is not in 2nd, then it must be in 4th or 5th (since not 1st and not 3rd because 3rd is I). Similarly, if E is not in 4th, then it must be in 1st or 2nd.

So we can narrow down.

Therefore, I choose ""TRIED"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is in the word but not in the 1st position (-).
- A is not in the word (x).
- I is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓).
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-).

Key insights:
- The secret word has 'I' in the 3rd position (e.g., _ _ I _ _).
- The word contains 'R' and 'E', but 'R' cannot be in the 1st position, and 'E' cannot be in the 5th position.
- 'A' and 'S' are absent, so they are excluded from the next guess.
- Possible positions for 'R': 2nd, 4th, or 5th.
- Possible positions for 'E': 1st, 2nd, or 4th.

For the second guess, I chose ""TRIED"" because:
- It includes 'R' and 'E' (required letters) in testable positions: 'R' in 2nd position and 'E' in 4th position.
- It avoids 'A' and 'S' (excluded letters).
- It introduces two new common letters ('T' and 'D') to gather more information.
- The 3rd position is 'I' (fixed from feedback).
- If 'R' or 'E' are misplaced, the feedback will help narrow their positions (e.g., if 'R' is not in 2nd, it must be in 4th or 5th; if 'E' is not in 4th, it must be in 1st or 2nd).

The letter \'I\' is in the word and in the 3rd position (since it was correct in ""RAISE"" at position 3).\n2. The letter \'R\' is in the word but not in the 1st position.\n3. The letter \'E\' is in the word but not in the 5th position.\n4. The letters \'A\' and \'S\' are not in the word at all.\n\nTherefore, the secret word:\n- Must have \'I\' in the 3rd position: _ _ I _ _\n- Contains \'R\' and \'E\', but not in the 1st and 5th positions respectively (and also not in the positions they were guessed).\n- Does not contain \'A\' or \'S\'.\n\nWe also know that the word is 5 letters and a valid English word.\n\nNow, we need to make a second guess that incorporates this information.\n\nOur goal is to test possible positions for \'R\' and \'E\' and also to include new letters to gather more information.\n\nConstraints for the next guess:\n- Avoid using \'A\' and \'S\' because they are not in the word.\n- The 3rd letter must be \'I\'.\n- We must include \'R\' and \'E\' (since they are in the word) but in positions that are not ruled out.\n\nPossible positions for \'R\':\n- It cannot be in the 1st position (because in the first guess it was in the 1st and was wrong). So it can be in 2nd, 4th, or 5th.\n\nPossible positions for \'E\':\n- It cannot be in the 5th position (because in the first guess it was in the 5th and was wrong). So it can be in 1st, 2nd, or 4th.\n\nBut note: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nWe also need to include three new letters (since we have to use 5 letters and we already know two: R and E, and one fixed: I in the middle). Actually, we have:\n- Position 3 is fixed as \'I\'.\n- We must include \'R\' and \'E\' in the word, but in other positions (1,2,4,5) but with constraints.\n\nWe can try to form a word that has:\n- 3rd letter: I\n- Includes R and E in positions that are allowed (for R: not 1; for E: not 5).\n\nAlso, we want to test as many new letters as possible to get more information.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit this pattern.\n\nWe know the word does not have A or S, so we can avoid those.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe should try to cover common consonants and vowels. We already have one vowel: I. The word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but common words often have vowels.\n\nWe have E in the word, which is a vowel.\n\nSo, we can try to use a word that has:\n- Position 1: a new letter (but cannot be R because R cannot be in position 1) and cannot be A or S.\n- Position 2: could be R, E, or a new letter.\n- Position 3: I (fixed)\n- Position 4: could be R, E, or a new letter.\n- Position 5: could be R (since R can be in 5th) but not E (because E cannot be in 5th). So position 5 must be a new letter or R.\n\nBut note: E cannot be in position 5, so position 5 must be either R or a new letter.\n\nLet me try to come up with candidate words.\n\nWe can try to put E in position 1 (which is allowed) and R in position 4, for example.\n\nWord pattern: E _ I R ?\n\nBut we need a letter for position 2 and 5. And we must avoid A and S.\n\nExample: ""EPIR?"" - but that doesn\'t form a word. Let me think.\n\nHow about ""ELITE""? But wait, we have two T\'s? Also, we have E in position 1 and 5? But we cannot have E in position 5 because the feedback said E is not in the 5th. So ""ELITE"" has E in 5th, which is not allowed.\n\nWe must avoid E in 5th.\n\nAnother idea: put E in position 2 and R in position 4.\n\nPattern: _ E I R ?\n\nWe need a consonant for position 1 and a letter for position 5 (which can be R? but R is already in 4th, so no, we can\'t use R twice unless the word has two R\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. We should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.\n\nSo, let\'s assume no duplicate letters for now.\n\nThen, we have:\n- Position 1: must be a new letter (not A, S, and not R, E, I because we are using them in other positions? Actually, we can use R and E only once, and I is fixed in the middle).\n- Position 2: E (we are trying this)\n- Position 3: I\n- Position 4: R\n- Position 5: a new letter.\n\nSo the pattern: ? E I R ?\n\nWhat letters can we put in position 1 and 5? We need a valid word.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""DEVIL"" has V and L, but the pattern would be D E V I L -> but we need I in 3rd, so that would be D E V I L -> positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:V -> but we need 3rd to be I, so that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe need the 3rd to be I, so the word must be: [letter1] E I [letter4] [letter5]\n\nBut we are putting R in position 4? So: [letter1] E I R [letter5]\n\nNow, what words have this pattern? And avoid A and S.\n\nExamples:\n- ""FEIRY""? Not a word.\n- ""HEIRD""? Not common, and it\'s HEIRD (meaning: a person who inherits) but it\'s 5 letters? H-E-I-R-D. That\'s a word? Let me check: Heird is not standard. Maybe ""HEIR"" is 4 letters.\n\nAnother: ""WEIRD"" -> W-E-I-R-D. That\'s a valid word.\n\nSo, ""WEIRD"" has:\n- W in position 1 (new)\n- E in position 2 (which is allowed because E can be in 2nd)\n- I in position 3 (fixed)\n- R in position 4 (allowed because R can be in 4th)\n- D in position 5 (new)\n\nAnd it avoids A and S.\n\nThis seems like a good candidate.\n\nBut note: we are not sure if R can be in 4th, but we are testing it.\n\nAlternatively, we could put R in position 2 and E in position 1? But E in position 1 is allowed.\n\nPattern: E ? I ? ?\n\nBut then we have to place R somewhere (not position 1, so 2,4,5) but position 2 is free? Actually, we can do E R I ? ? -> but that would be ""ERI.."" and then we need two more letters.\n\nExample: ""ERICA"" -> but has A, which is not allowed. Also, A is not in the word.\n\n""ERICK"" is not a word.\n\n""ERIKA"" has A and is 5 letters? But A is not allowed.\n\n""ERINY"" -> Erinyes? Not 5 letters.\n\n""ERICA"" is 5 but has A.\n\nSo that might be hard.\n\nAnother pattern: put E in position 4 and R in position 2.\n\nPattern: ? R I E ?\n\nBut then position 1 and 5 are new.\n\nExample: ""CRIEP""? Not a word.\n\n""TRIED"" -> T-R-I-E-D. That\'s a word.\n\n""TRIED"":\n- T in 1 (new)\n- R in 2 (allowed because R can be in 2nd? But in the first guess, R was in 1st and was wrong, but 2nd is a new position and allowed)\n- I in 3 (fixed)\n- E in 4 (allowed because E can be in 4th? The constraint for E is not in 5th, so 4th is okay)\n- D in 5 (new)\n\nAnd avoids A and S.\n\nSo we have two candidates: ""WEIRD"" and ""TRIED"".\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nBut note: in ""TRIED"", we are putting R in position 2. We don\'t know if that is correct, but we are testing.\n\nSimilarly, in ""WEIRD"", we are putting E in 2 and R in 4.\n\nWhich one gives more information? Both use three new letters: for ""WEIRD"": W, E (in a new position), R (in a new position), and D. Actually, we already know E and R are in the word, so we are testing their positions. The new letters are W and D.\n\nSimilarly, in ""TRIED"": new letters are T and D.\n\nWe might get more information by choosing one that has more common letters? Or that covers more possibilities.\n\nBut both are similar.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that doesn\'t put both R and E in the same guess? But that might be inefficient because we have to test both.\n\nWe know they are in the word, so we should try to find their positions.\n\nAnother candidate: put R in position 5? Then we have to put E in position 1,2, or 4.\n\nFor example: ? ? I ? R\n\nBut we also have to include E.\n\nExample: put E in position 1: E ? I ? R -> words: ""ELMIR""? Not a word. ""EXPIR""? Not a word.\n\nPut E in position 2: ? E I ? R -> ""LEVIR""? Not common. ""DEVIR""? Not a word.\n\nPut E in position 4: ? ? I E R -> ""CUTER"" but 3rd is U, not I. We need 3rd to be I: so [letter1] [letter2] I E R\n\nExamples: ""OUIER""? Not a word. ""BAKER"" has A, not allowed. ""MAKER"" has A and M? But A is not allowed. ""TIMER"" -> T-I-M-E-R -> but 3rd is M, not I. \n\n""FIER?"" -> ""FIERY"" is 5 letters? F-I-E-R-Y -> but that would be positions: 1:F, 2:I, 3:E -> but we need 3rd to be I, so that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe need the 3rd to be I: so the word must be: [letter1] [letter2] I [letter4] R\n\nAnd we also need to include E. So E must be in position 1,2, or 4? But position 4 is the fourth letter, which is after I.\n\nSo if we put E in position 4, then the word is [letter1] [letter2] I E R\n\nWhat words? ""Crier"" has C and R? C-R-I-E-R -> but that\'s 5 letters? C-R-I-E-R is 5: positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:I, 4:E, 5:R -> but that has two R\'s? And we don\'t know if the word has duplicates. Also, we are using R twice? But we don\'t know if R appears twice.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\nSo, without duplicates, we need [letter1] [letter2] I E R, and [letter1] and [letter2] are not R, E, I (but I is in 3rd, so they can be other letters).\n\nBut we also have to avoid A and S.\n\nExamples: ""BRIER"" has two R\'s. ""PLIER"" -> P-L-I-E-R: that\'s a word. And it has no duplicates? P, L, I, E, R -> all distinct.\n\nBut note: in ""PLIER"", we have:\n- P (new)\n- L (new)\n- I (fixed)\n- E (in position 4, which is allowed)\n- R (in position 5, which is allowed for R because R can be in 5th)\n\nBut we have to check if E in position 4 is allowed? Yes, because the constraint for E is not in 5th, so 4th is okay.\n\nSimilarly, R in 5th is okay.\n\nSo ""PLIER"" is a candidate.\n\nNow we have three candidates: ""WEIRD"", ""TRIED"", and ""PLIER"".\n\nWhich one to choose?\n\nWe want to maximize the information about the positions of R and E, and also test new letters.\n\nIn ""WEIRD"": \n- We are testing E in position 2 and R in position 4.\n- New letters: W and D.\n\nIn ""TRIED"":\n- Testing R in position 2 and E in position 4.\n- New letters: T and D.\n\nIn ""PLIER"":\n- Testing E in position 4 and R in position 5.\n- New letters: P, L, and no D? Actually, all are new except I, E, R.\n\nBut we already know E and R are in the word, so we are testing their positions.\n\n""PLIER"" uses two new letters: P and L.\n\nNow, which one is better? \n\nNote that in the first feedback, we have R and E in the word but not in the positions we guessed.

But we have I and E, which are vowels, so it might be enough.\n\nI think ""TRIED"" is a good choice because:\n- It uses common letters.\n- It tests R in position 2 and E in position 4.\n\nSimilarly, ""WEIRD"" is also good.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that tests only one of them? But we have to include both because they are in the word.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that has E and R but also includes other common letters to get more information.\n\nAnother candidate: ""URINE"" -> but has U and N, and E in 5th? But E cannot be in 5th. So not allowed.\n\n""OPINE"" -> O-P-I-N-E: but E is in 5th, not allowed.\n\n""ADIEU"" -> has A and E in 4th? But A is not allowed.\n\nSo, back to the candidates.\n\nI think ""TRIED"" is a solid choice.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""TRIED"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: T-R-I-E-D\n- T: new\n- R: in position 2 (we are testing if R is in 2nd)\n- I: correct (fixed)\n- E: in position 4 (testing if E is in 4th)\n- D: new\n\nThis will give us feedback on:\n- If R is in 2nd, we get a check or a minus.\n- If E is in 4th, we get a check or a minus.\n- And we learn about T and D.\n\nIf we get minuses, we know that R is not in 2nd and E is not in 4th, so they must be in other positions.\n\nFor example, if R is not in 2nd, then it must be in 4th or 5th (since not 1st and not 3rd because 3rd is I). Similarly, if E is not in 4th, then it must be in 1st or 2nd.\n\nSo we can narrow down.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""TRIED"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R is in the word but not in the 1st position (-).\n- A is not in the word (x).\n- I is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓).\n- S is not in the word (x).\n- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-).\n\nKey insights:\n- The secret word has \'I\' in the 3rd position (e.g., _ _ I _ _).\n- The word contains \'R\' and \'E\', but \'R\' cannot be in the 1st position, and \'E\' cannot be in the 5th position.\n- \'A\' and \'S\' are absent, so they are excluded from the next guess.\n- Possible positions for \'R\': 2nd, 4th, or 5th.\n- Possible positions for \'E\': 1st, 2nd, or 4th.\n\nFor the second guess, I chose ""TRIED"" because:\n- It includes \'R\' and \'E\' (required letters) in testable positions: \'R\' in 2nd position and \'E\' in 4th position.\n- It avoids \'A\' and \'S\' (excluded letters).\n- It introduces two new common letters (\'T\' and \'D\') to gather more information.\n- The 3rd position is \'I\' (fixed from feedback).\n- If \'R\' or \'E\' are misplaced, the feedback will help narrow their positions (e.g., if \'R\' is not in 2nd, it must be in 4th or 5th; if \'E\' is not in 4th, it must be in 1st or 2nd).\n\n<guess>TRIED</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: TRIED -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(✓) E(✓) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(-), A(x), I(✓), S(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is not in the word.
- I is in the word and correct in position 3.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: TRIED -> T(x), R(✓), I(✓), E(✓), D(x)
Meaning:
- T is not in the word.
- R is correct in position 2.
- I is correct in position 3.
- E is correct in position 4.
- D is not in the word.

So now we know:
1. Positions:
   - Position 2: R (fixed)
   - Position 3: I (fixed)
   - Position 4: E (fixed)
2. The word has R in the 2nd position, I in the 3rd, and E in the 4th. So the secret word pattern is: _ R I E _
3. We also know that the word contains R, I, E (from Guess 1 and confirmed in Guess 2) and we have these positions fixed.
4. From Guess 1, we know that R is not in position 1 (but now we see it's in position 2, which matches) and E is not in position 5 (and now we have it in 4, so position 5 is free for something else).
5. Excluded letters: A, S (from Guess 1), T, D (from Guess 2). So the secret word does not contain A, S, T, or D.

Therefore, we need to find a 5-letter word of the form: ? R I E ?
- The first and last positions must be filled with letters that are not A, S, T, D.
- And since there are no other constraints (except that the word must exist), we have positions 1 and 5 to guess.

Possible letters: we should avoid A, S, T, D. So we can use other common letters like B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we must form a valid English word that fits the pattern: [letter1] R I E [letter5]

Common words that fit this pattern:
- ""FRIED"": F-R-I-E-D -> but D is excluded? In Guess 2, D is marked as not in the word (x). So D cannot be in the word, so ""FRIED"" is invalid because it has D.
- ""CRIER"": C-R-I-E-R -> note that R is repeated? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, we haven't had any feedback suggesting duplicates. Also, the first R is in position 2 (fixed) and another R in position 5? But in ""CRIER"", the last letter is R. But we have to see if that's allowed. However, note that the pattern is ? R I E ?, so ""CRIER"" is C-R-I-E-R -> so position 5 is R. Now, we must check if R is allowed to be repeated? The feedback didn't show duplicate letters so far, but possible. But we know that R is in the word for sure, but maybe only once? We are not sure. However, we haven't ruled out duplicates. But in ""CRIER"", the last letter is R, which is present. Also, it avoids A,S,T,D: since C and R are used, and R is already included.

But let's check the exclusions: A,S,T,D are out. So C is allowed? Yes. But the word ""CRIER"" has two R's? Which might be invalid if the secret word has only one R? But we don't know.

However, in Guess 1: we guessed RAISE which has one R and got R as minus (meaning it is in the word but not position 1). Then in Guess 2: TRIED has R in position 2 and got correct. Now, if the secret word had another R, it might have shown up? But not necessarily, because the feedback doesn't account for duplicates specifically; it only marks per occurrence. For instance, if a word has two of the same letter and you guess one correctly, the other won't necessarily show as minus if it's not present? Actually, Wordle rules: if a letter is repeated, and you guess one correctly, the other might show as minus if it's misplaced or absent if the occurrence is less? But this depends on the frequency.

To avoid complexity, let's try to find words without duplicates first? Or consider possibilities.

But we must form a word. Other words:

- ""PRIED"": P-R-I-E-D -> but D is excluded (x from Guess 2), so not allowed.
- ""BRIEF"": B-R-I-E-F -> F is allowed? And ""BRIEF"" ends with F. But that's a 5-letter word? B-R-I-E-F: positions 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:E, 5:F -> yes. And it avoids A,S,T,D. So this is a candidate. It uses F (new letter).
- ""GRIEF"": G-R-I-E-F -> same as above.
- ""BRIBE"": B-R-I-B-E -> has two B's? But ends with E? But E is already in position 4? And position 5 is B? But ""BRIBE"" is B-R-I-B-E -> so position 5 is E? But we have position 4 as E, and 5 as E? That would be two E's? But we know E is in the word, but we don't know if duplicated. Also, the pattern requires E in position 4? And position 5 would be B? But ""BRIBE"" is B-R-I-B-E -> so fifth letter is E? But in our pattern, position 4 is E? So it's B-R-I-B-E -> so positions: 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:B, 5:E -> but that conflicts because position 4 should be E? Here it is B? Actually, no: in ""BRIBE"", the letters are B, R, I, B, E -> so position 4 is B, position 5 is E -> but we have position 4 fixed to E. So it must be E in 4. Therefore, ""BRIBE"" has position 4 as B, which is not E. So invalid for our pattern.

We need position 4 to be E: so a word must end after I with E? And then position 5 is any letter? No: the word has five positions: 1:R? No, position 1 must be filled, then R in 2, I in 3, E in 4, and then a letter in 5.

So the word pattern: [letter] R I E [letter]

Other words:
- ""FRIES"": F-R-I-E-S -> but ends with S? But S is excluded (from Guess 1), so not allowed.
- ""CRIES"": C-R-I-E-S -> S excluded.
- ""PRIES"": P-R-I-E-S -> S excluded.
- ""TRIED"": already guessed and we know D is excluded, so not useful.
- ""ORIEL"": O-R-I-E-L -> L is allowed? So ""ORIEL"". This is a word (a type of gallery or bay window). Positions: O in 1, R in 2, I in 3, E in 4, L in 5. And O and L are not excluded. Good candidate.
- ""URINE"": U-R-I-N-E -> ends with E? But position 5 is E? But we know E is not in position 5 (from first feedback: E(-) meaning not in 5). So if ""URINE"" is U-R-I-N-E, then position 5 is E? That would be disallowed? So we cannot use E in position 5? But unless the word has two E's? We don't know. But the feedback from Guess 1 told us E is in the word but not in position 5. Then in Guess 2 we have E in position 4 and it was correct. So E cannot be in position 5 because it was explicitly ruled out? So if ""URINE"" has E in position 5, it would be invalid? Because E is in position 5? But we know E is in position 4? How does E being in position 5 conflict? It would be a second E? We don't know if the word has one or two E's. But the key point is: in Guess 1, E was guessed in position 5 and was marked minus, meaning it's not in position 5? That doesn't necessarily mean E can't be in position 5 if duplicated? Actually, no: in Wordle, the minus symbol means that the letter is in the word or not? For E: in Guess 1 it was in position 5 and got minus, meaning that E is not in position 5? Because it was yellow meaning it is in the word but not that position, not necessarily that it can't be duplicated? But the secret word might have two E's? However, since we are going by the pattern, we have fixed E in position 4? We don't know if the word has another E? But we must find words that have E only in position 4? Or possibly elsewhere? But we have evidence?

The feedback doesn't tell us the frequency? But if the word had two E's, then when we guessed E in position 5? In Guess 1 we guessed E in position 5? But if the secret word has E in position 4 and also position 5? Then in Guess 1: RAISE has E in position 5? And if the secret word had E in position 5? Then it should be green? But it was not, so E is not in position 5? Therefore, position 5 cannot be E? Because the feedback explicitly says E is not in position 5? So we must avoid E in position 5? Similarly, if the secret word had two E's? But the position 5 E was not green? So it would still be yellow if misplaced? Wait, no: in Guess 1, we had E in position 5? But if the secret word had E in position 5? Then it should be green? But it was yellow? So E is in the word but not in position 5? Therefore, position 5 cannot be E because if it were, it would have been green? So we know no E in position 5? And since we have E fixed in position 4? We can assume position 5 is not E? Likewise, we don't know if there are multiple E's? But we haven't seen any evidence of duplicate E so far.

Similarly, for R: we have R fixed in position 2? Could there be another R? We don't know? But we avoid duplicates for now? But in the pattern, position 1 and 5 could be R? But then the word would be R R I E ? -> not possible? Or X R I E R -> like ""CRIER"".

But we can consider possibilities.

However, to simplify, let's focus on words that fit [non-A,S,T,D] R I E [non-E, non-A,S,T,D]

So for position 5: cannot be E? Because we know E is not in position 5? Also cannot be A, S, T, D? So options: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, possible words:
1. ""ORIEL"": O-R-I-E-L -> O and L are not excluded, and L is not E? So this is valid? And O and L are new.
2. ""BRIEF"": B-R-I-E-F -> B and F are not excluded? But ""BRIEF"" ends with F? And F is allowed? So valid?
3. ""GRIEF"": G-R-I-E-F -> same.
4. ""CRIER"": C-R-I-E-R -> C and R? But R is already in position 2? And C is allowed? But if we allow duplicates? Then we might get feedback? But it's a valid guess? However, we don't know if duplicates exist? But it would be an option? But we would learn about the duplicate? So I should not avoid it? But let's see if there are more words.

We need a word that exists: common words?

Also: ""GRILL""? But pattern must be R in 2, I in 3, E in 4? So ""GRILL"" is G-R-I-L-L -> position 4 is L, not E? No, doesn't fit.

Another: ""WRITE"": W-R-I-T-E -> but T is excluded? From Guess 2? T is not in the word? So cannot be T? And position 4 is T? But our pattern requires E in position 4? So no.

""PRIME"": P-R-I-M-E -> M? And E in position 5? But we need E in position 4? ""PRIME"" is P-R-I-M-E -> positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:I, 4:M, 5:E -> but E is in position 5? But we need E in position 4? So invalid? Because we must have E in position 4? Our pattern is ? R I E ? -> so position 4 is E? So words must end with I then E? And then another letter? But ""PRIME"" has E at the end? So it matches the pattern: P R I M E -> so position 4 is M? Then position 5 is E? But our pattern: position 4 must be E? Because we know E is correct in position 4? So in ""PRIME"", position 4 is M, not E? So it doesn't fit? We require the fourth letter to be E? Yes.

The pattern is: letter1, letter2=R, letter3=I, letter4=E, letter5.

So for ""PRIME"": P, R, I, M, E -> position 4 is M? Which is not E? So not matching? Only if it were PRIE something? Like ""PRIED"" is excluded.

So back to: 
- Words like ""BRIEF"": B,R,I,E,F -> F at the end? But is F excluded? No? So allowed? 
- Similarly, ""GRIET"" is not a word? 
- ""ORIEL"": O,R,I,E,L -> L in position 5.

Which one to choose? We have only a few choices? And we are running low on guesses? But we have 4 left.

I can choose a word that has common letters? But we have to guess one of them? Since we know positions 2,3,4 are fixed? And only positions 1 and 5 matter? But we must guess the entire word? So if we guess ""ORIEL"", and if it's not correct? We get feedback? Similarly? 

But actually, if we guess correctly? The feedback will show.

But we can also try to think of all possible words? 

Other words: ""FRIED"" is excluded (D).
""PRIED"" excluded (D).
""CRIBS"" excluded (S).
""GRIBE"" not a word? 

So probably ""BRIEF"", ""GRIEF"", ""ORIEL"", ""CRIER"" (if duplicate allowed).

But let's look up common words? 

Another: ""BRIER""? has R at the end? B-R-I-E-R -> duplicate R? And ends with R? R is in position 5? And not excluded? But we have to see? 

But ""BRIER"" is a word.

Similarly, ""DRYER""? but has D? D excluded.

So likely candidates: 
1. ""BRIEF"" 
2. ""GRIEF""
3. ""ORIEL""
4. ""CRIER""
5. ""BRIER""

But in ""CRIER"" and ""BRIER"", they have R at the end? So we have R twice? If the secret word has R only once? Then position 5 R might be marked as absent? But we will see? Since we have R fixed in position 2? Then if there is no second R? The position 5 R would be marked? But we can guess? However, it remains a valid guess? 

Given that we are narrowing on a few possibilities? And we need to test? But we might be able to guess the answer? 

Observing the situation: we know that position 2 must be R, 3 must be I, 4 must be E? So the word is determined? Only positions 1 and 5? So we can try to guess? 

The most common word? Among ""BRIEF"", ""GRIEF"", ""ORIEL"", etc? Or we can choose a word with less common letters to cover? But we have limited time? 

Since we have only two positions to guess? And excluded letters? We can calculate the possible letters? But let's choose a word that has not been excluded and exists? 

I think ""BRIEF"" is a good candidate? But let me see the previous feedback: we have tried R,A,I,S,E,T,R,I,E,D? So we haven't tried B,F,G,O,L? etc? 

But we don't need to try? Because the word is fixed except first and last? So any guess that fits the pattern is acceptable? 

But we have to guess one? 

If we guess ""BRIEF"", then the secret word might be ""GRIEF"" or ""ORIEL""? So if wrong? Then we lose a guess? 

But we have 6 guesses total? We are on guess 3? We can make multiple guesses? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests common possibilities? But since we know the pattern? We can guess ""GRIED""? But D excluded? 

I think we should pick one? 

Another word? ""WRIED"" is not a word? 

""PRIER"": P-R-I-E-R -> duplicate R? And P and R? Then position 5 is R? This is similar to ""CRIER"".

But ""PRIER"" is a word.

Now, how about ""FRIER""? F excluded? 

We haven't excluded F? But F is not mentioned? So allowed? 

But let's list:

Possible words:
- ORIEL: O in 1, L in 5
- BRIEF: B in 1, F in 5
- GRIEF: G in 1, F in 5
- CRIER: C in 1, R in 5
- BRIER: B in 1, R in 5 -> but B can be in 1?
- PRIER: P in 1, R in 5
- GRIER: not common? 

Also, ""GRIEV"" not a word.
""FRILL"" not fitting pattern.

So we have several? 

But note: in ""BRIEF"" and ""GRIEF"", they share F in 5? So if F is common? 

Alternatively, ""CHIED"" excluded D? 

Don't see ""H"" possibilities.

I think ""ORIEL"" is a good candidate because it uses O and L, which are common vowels? But we have R,I,E, so vowels might be covered? 

Given that we have only the first and last letters unknown? And we have exclusion for A,S,T,D? So let's choose ""ORIEL""? 

Or ""BRIEF""? 

But to maximize information? If we guess ""ORIEL"", and the answer is ""BRIEF"", we will know? Similarly? 

Since we have high confidence, I'll go with ""GRIEF""? 

But I recall that in the example? The secret word was ""BRISK""? Which isn't? Well, we are not matching? 

Another common word is ""FRIED"" but D excluded? 

Perhaps ""BRIBE"" doesn't fit? 

Wait, there's ""CRIED"" excluded D? 

I think among these, ""BRIEF"" is a word? Or ""GRIEF"". 

But let me choose ""BRIEF"": B-R-I-E-F.

Reasons:
- B and F are common letters not yet tested? 
- It introduces new consonants? 

If feedback shows:
- B: if x? Then not in word? Or if ✓? Then correct? Similarly for F? Then we can deduce? 

For example, if we guess ""BRIEF"" and get:
- B: either ✓ or x? Or minus? 
But note: positions 2,3,4 are fixed? So for position 1: B? And position 5: F? 

The feedback will directly tell? 

If it's correct? We win? If not? Then we try other? 

Similarly? 

But to save guesses? Since one of these must be the answer? 

However, there are several? 

But wait? Is ""GRIEF"" more common? Or ""BRIEF""? 

Typically, ""GRIEF"" might be chosen? 

But I notice that one of the possibilities is ""WRITE"" but T excluded? No? 

Another word: ""DRIVE"" D excluded? 

So let's choose ""GRIEF""? 

But we can also note that in the first guess? R was guessed? Etc? 

I think we should go with ""BRIEF"" or ""GRIEF"". 

I'll choose ""BRIEF"". 

But ""BRIEF"" uses B and F? 

Alternatively, ""ORIEL"" uses O and L? 

To cover? Suppose we guess ""BORER""? But not matching pattern? 

So yes, ""BRIEF"" is a valid choice? 

Perhaps ""URINE"" is excluded because E cannot be in position 5? But for URINE: U-R-I-N-E? Position 5 is E? Which is not allowed? Because we know E is not in position 5? So we cannot use E there? So ""URINE"" is invalid. 

So valid words are non-E in position 5? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""BRIEF"" with this thought? 

But let me confirm: ""BRIEF"" is a 5-letter word? Yes? Meaning short in duration or a report? 

So? 

<guess>BRIEF</guess>? 

But we already used two guesses? This is the third? 

Given that, and to quickly hit? 

Another common option: ""FRIAR""? But not matching? F-R-I-A-R -> position 5 is R? But pattern must be E in position 4? So F-R-I-A-position4? Should be E? Not A. So ""FRIAR"" has A? And A is excluded? So no. 

So decided? 
</think>
Based on the feedback, we can deduce:

1. **Pattern Confirmation**: The feedback from Guess 2 shows that R is correctly placed in the 2nd position (✓), I is correctly placed in the 3rd position (✓), and E is correctly placed in the 4th position (✓). Therefore, the secret word pattern is: _ R I E _.
2. **Fixed Letters**: Positions 2, 3, and 4 are confirmed: R, I, E respectively.
3. **Excluded Letters**: A and S (from Guess 1) and T and D (from Guess 2) are not in the word, so they cannot appear in positions 1 or 5.
4. **Constraints**:
   - Position 1: Must be a letter not A, S, T, D, E, or R (we avoid duplicates unless confirmed; E and R are already placed).
   - Position 5: Must not be E (since Guess 1 proved E cannot be in position 5), and not A, S, T, or D.
5. **Possible Words**: Candidates like ""ORIEL"" (O and L), ""GRIEF"" (G and F), and ""BRIEF"" (B and F) fit the pattern and avoid excluded letters. ""CRIER"" and ""BRIER"" were considered but discarded to avoid duplicate R (not confirmed) and prioritize words with new letters for information gain.

Selected Guess: **BRIEF**  
- Position 1: B (new, common consonant)  
- Position 2: R (fixed)  
- Position 3: I (fixed)  
- Position 4: E (fixed)  
- Position 5: F (new, common consonant)  
This tests the unknown positions efficiently and introduces two new letters (B and F) to refine possibilities.

<guess>BRIEF</guess>",BRIEF,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(-), A(x), I(✓), S(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is not in the word.
- I is in the word and correct in position 3.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: TRIED -> T(x), R(✓), I(✓), E(✓), D(x)
Meaning:
- T is not in the word.
- R is correct in position 2.
- I is correct in position 3.
- E is correct in position 4.
- D is not in the word.

So now we know:
1. Positions:
   - Position 2: R (fixed)
   - Position 3: I (fixed)
   - Position 4: E (fixed)
2. The word has R in the 2nd position, I in the 3rd, and E in the 4th. So the secret word pattern is: _ R I E _
3. We also know that the word contains R, I, E (from Guess 1 and confirmed in Guess 2) and we have these positions fixed.
4. From Guess 1, we know that R is not in position 1 (but now we see it's in position 2, which matches) and E is not in position 5 (and now we have it in 4, so position 5 is free for something else).
5. Excluded letters: A, S (from Guess 1), T, D (from Guess 2). So the secret word does not contain A, S, T, or D.

Therefore, we need to find a 5-letter word of the form: ? R I E ?
- The first and last positions must be filled with letters that are not A, S, T, D.
- And since there are no other constraints (except that the word must exist), we have positions 1 and 5 to guess.

Possible letters: we should avoid A, S, T, D. So we can use other common letters like B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we must form a valid English word that fits the pattern: [letter1] R I E [letter5]

Common words that fit this pattern:
- ""FRIED"": F-R-I-E-D -> but D is excluded? In Guess 2, D is marked as not in the word (x). So D cannot be in the word, so ""FRIED"" is invalid because it has D.
- ""CRIER"": C-R-I-E-R -> note that R is repeated? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, we haven't had any feedback suggesting duplicates. Also, the first R is in position 2 (fixed) and another R in position 5? But in ""CRIER"", the last letter is R. But we have to see if that's allowed. However, note that the pattern is ? R I E ?, so ""CRIER"" is C-R-I-E-R -> so position 5 is R. Now, we must check if R is allowed to be repeated? The feedback didn't show duplicate letters so far, but possible. But we know that R is in the word for sure, but maybe only once? We are not sure. However, we haven't ruled out duplicates. But in ""CRIER"", the last letter is R, which is present. Also, it avoids A,S,T,D: since C and R are used, and R is already included.

But let's check the exclusions: A,S,T,D are out. So C is allowed? Yes. But the word ""CRIER"" has two R's? Which might be invalid if the secret word has only one R? But we don't know.

However, in Guess 1: we guessed RAISE which has one R and got R as minus (meaning it is in the word but not position 1). Then in Guess 2: TRIED has R in position 2 and got correct. Now, if the secret word had another R, it might have shown up? But not necessarily, because the feedback doesn't account for duplicates specifically; it only marks per occurrence. For instance, if a word has two of the same letter and you guess one correctly, the other won't necessarily show as minus if it's not present? Actually, Wordle rules: if a letter is repeated, and you guess one correctly, the other might show as minus if it's misplaced or absent if the occurrence is less? But this depends on the frequency.

To avoid complexity, let's try to find words without duplicates first? Or consider possibilities.

But we must form a word. Other words:

- ""PRIED"": P-R-I-E-D -> but D is excluded (x from Guess 2), so not allowed.
- ""BRIEF"": B-R-I-E-F -> F is allowed? And ""BRIEF"" ends with F. But that's a 5-letter word? B-R-I-E-F: positions 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:E, 5:F -> yes. And it avoids A,S,T,D. So this is a candidate. It uses F (new letter).
- ""GRIEF"": G-R-I-E-F -> same as above.
- ""BRIBE"": B-R-I-B-E -> has two B's? But ends with E? But E is already in position 4? And position 5 is B? But ""BRIBE"" is B-R-I-B-E -> so position 5 is E? But we have position 4 as E, and 5 as E? That would be two E's? But we know E is in the word, but we don't know if duplicated. Also, the pattern requires E in position 4? And position 5 would be B? But ""BRIBE"" is B-R-I-B-E -> so fifth letter is E? But in our pattern, position 4 is E? So it's B-R-I-B-E -> so positions: 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:B, 5:E -> but that conflicts because position 4 should be E? Here it is B? Actually, no: in ""BRIBE"", the letters are B, R, I, B, E -> so position 4 is B, position 5 is E -> but we have position 4 fixed to E. So it must be E in 4. Therefore, ""BRIBE"" has position 4 as B, which is not E. So invalid for our pattern.

We need position 4 to be E: so a word must end after I with E? And then position 5 is any letter? No: the word has five positions: 1:R? No, position 1 must be filled, then R in 2, I in 3, E in 4, and then a letter in 5.

So the word pattern: [letter] R I E [letter]

Other words:
- ""FRIES"": F-R-I-E-S -> but ends with S? But S is excluded (from Guess 1), so not allowed.
- ""CRIES"": C-R-I-E-S -> S excluded.
- ""PRIES"": P-R-I-E-S -> S excluded.
- ""TRIED"": already guessed and we know D is excluded, so not useful.
- ""ORIEL"": O-R-I-E-L -> L is allowed? So ""ORIEL"". This is a word (a type of gallery or bay window). Positions: O in 1, R in 2, I in 3, E in 4, L in 5. And O and L are not excluded. Good candidate.
- ""URINE"": U-R-I-N-E -> ends with E? But position 5 is E? But we know E is not in position 5 (from first feedback: E(-) meaning not in 5). So if ""URINE"" is U-R-I-N-E, then position 5 is E? That would be disallowed? So we cannot use E in position 5? But unless the word has two E's? We don't know. But the feedback from Guess 1 told us E is in the word but not in position 5. Then in Guess 2 we have E in position 4 and it was correct. So E cannot be in position 5 because it was explicitly ruled out? So if ""URINE"" has E in position 5, it would be invalid? Because E is in position 5? But we know E is in position 4? How does E being in position 5 conflict? It would be a second E? We don't know if the word has one or two E's. But the key point is: in Guess 1, E was guessed in position 5 and was marked minus, meaning it's not in position 5? That doesn't necessarily mean E can't be in position 5 if duplicated? Actually, no: in Wordle, the minus symbol means that the letter is in the word or not? For E: in Guess 1 it was in position 5 and got minus, meaning that E is not in position 5? Because it was yellow meaning it is in the word but not that position, not necessarily that it can't be duplicated? But the secret word might have two E's? However, since we are going by the pattern, we have fixed E in position 4? We don't know if the word has another E? But we must find words that have E only in position 4? Or possibly elsewhere? But we have evidence?

The feedback doesn't tell us the frequency? But if the word had two E's, then when we guessed E in position 5? In Guess 1 we guessed E in position 5? But if the secret word has E in position 4 and also position 5? Then in Guess 1: RAISE has E in position 5? And if the secret word had E in position 5? Then it should be green? But it was not, so E is not in position 5? Therefore, position 5 cannot be E? Because the feedback explicitly says E is not in position 5? So we must avoid E in position 5? Similarly, if the secret word had two E's? But the position 5 E was not green? So it would still be yellow if misplaced? Wait, no: in Guess 1, we had E in position 5? But if the secret word had E in position 5? Then it should be green? But it was yellow? So E is in the word but not in position 5? Therefore, position 5 cannot be E because if it were, it would have been green? So we know no E in position 5? And since we have E fixed in position 4? We can assume position 5 is not E? Likewise, we don't know if there are multiple E's? But we haven't seen any evidence of duplicate E so far.

Similarly, for R: we have R fixed in position 2? Could there be another R? We don't know? But we avoid duplicates for now? But in the pattern, position 1 and 5 could be R? But then the word would be R R I E ? -> not possible? Or X R I E R -> like ""CRIER"".

But we can consider possibilities.

However, to simplify, let's focus on words that fit [non-A,S,T,D] R I E [non-E, non-A,S,T,D]

So for position 5: cannot be E? Because we know E is not in position 5? Also cannot be A, S, T, D? So options: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, possible words:
1. ""ORIEL"": O-R-I-E-L -> O and L are not excluded, and L is not E? So this is valid? And O and L are new.
2. ""BRIEF"": B-R-I-E-F -> B and F are not excluded? But ""BRIEF"" ends with F? And F is allowed? So valid?
3. ""GRIEF"": G-R-I-E-F -> same.
4. ""CRIER"": C-R-I-E-R -> C and R? But R is already in position 2? And C is allowed? But if we allow duplicates? Then we might get feedback? But it's a valid guess? However, we don't know if duplicates exist? But it would be an option? But we would learn about the duplicate? So I should not avoid it? But let's see if there are more words.

We need a word that exists: common words?

Also: ""GRILL""? But pattern must be R in 2, I in 3, E in 4? So ""GRILL"" is G-R-I-L-L -> position 4 is L, not E? No, doesn't fit.

Another: ""WRITE"": W-R-I-T-E -> but T is excluded? From Guess 2? T is not in the word? So cannot be T? And position 4 is T? But our pattern requires E in position 4? So no.

""PRIME"": P-R-I-M-E -> M? And E in position 5? But we need E in position 4? ""PRIME"" is P-R-I-M-E -> positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:I, 4:M, 5:E -> but E is in position 5? But we need E in position 4? So invalid? Because we must have E in position 4? Our pattern is ? R I E ? -> so position 4 is E? So words must end with I then E? And then another letter? But ""PRIME"" has E at the end? So it matches the pattern: P R I M E -> so position 4 is M? Then position 5 is E? But our pattern: position 4 must be E? Because we know E is correct in position 4? So in ""PRIME"", position 4 is M, not E? So it doesn't fit? We require the fourth letter to be E? Yes.

The pattern is: letter1, letter2=R, letter3=I, letter4=E, letter5.

So for ""PRIME"": P, R, I, M, E -> position 4 is M? Which is not E? So not matching? Only if it were PRIE something? Like ""PRIED"" is excluded.

So back to: 
- Words like ""BRIEF"": B,R,I,E,F -> F at the end? But is F excluded? No? So allowed? 
- Similarly, ""GRIET"" is not a word? 
- ""ORIEL"": O,R,I,E,L -> L in position 5.

Which one to choose? We have only a few choices? And we are running low on guesses? But we have 4 left.

I can choose a word that has common letters? But we have to guess one of them? Since we know positions 2,3,4 are fixed? And only positions 1 and 5 matter? But we must guess the entire word? So if we guess ""ORIEL"", and if it's not correct? We get feedback? Similarly? 

But actually, if we guess correctly? The feedback will show.

But we can also try to think of all possible words? 

Other words: ""FRIED"" is excluded (D).
""PRIED"" excluded (D).
""CRIBS"" excluded (S).
""GRIBE"" not a word? 

So probably ""BRIEF"", ""GRIEF"", ""ORIEL"", ""CRIER"" (if duplicate allowed).

But let's look up common words? 

Another: ""BRIER""? has R at the end? B-R-I-E-R -> duplicate R? And ends with R? R is in position 5? And not excluded? But we have to see? 

But ""BRIER"" is a word.

Similarly, ""DRYER""? but has D? D excluded.

So likely candidates: 
1. ""BRIEF"" 
2. ""GRIEF""
3. ""ORIEL""
4. ""CRIER""
5. ""BRIER""

But in ""CRIER"" and ""BRIER"", they have R at the end? So we have R twice? If the secret word has R only once? Then position 5 R might be marked as absent? But we will see? Since we have R fixed in position 2? Then if there is no second R? The position 5 R would be marked? But we can guess? However, it remains a valid guess? 

Given that we are narrowing on a few possibilities? And we need to test? But we might be able to guess the answer? 

Observing the situation: we know that position 2 must be R, 3 must be I, 4 must be E? So the word is determined? Only positions 1 and 5? So we can try to guess? 

The most common word? Among ""BRIEF"", ""GRIEF"", ""ORIEL"", etc? Or we can choose a word with less common letters to cover? But we have limited time? 

Since we have only two positions to guess? And excluded letters? We can calculate the possible letters? But let's choose a word that has not been excluded and exists? 

I think ""BRIEF"" is a good candidate? But let me see the previous feedback: we have tried R,A,I,S,E,T,R,I,E,D? So we haven't tried B,F,G,O,L? etc? 

But we don't need to try? Because the word is fixed except first and last? So any guess that fits the pattern is acceptable? 

But we have to guess one? 

If we guess ""BRIEF"", then the secret word might be ""GRIEF"" or ""ORIEL""? So if wrong? Then we lose a guess? 

But we have 6 guesses total? We are on guess 3? We can make multiple guesses? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests common possibilities? But since we know the pattern? We can guess ""GRIED""? But D excluded? 

I think we should pick one? 

Another word? ""WRIED"" is not a word? 

""PRIER"": P-R-I-E-R -> duplicate R? And P and R? Then position 5 is R? This is similar to ""CRIER"".

But ""PRIER"" is a word.

Now, how about ""FRIER""? F excluded? 

We haven't excluded F? But F is not mentioned? So allowed? 

But let's list:

Possible words:
- ORIEL: O in 1, L in 5
- BRIEF: B in 1, F in 5
- GRIEF: G in 1, F in 5
- CRIER: C in 1, R in 5
- BRIER: B in 1, R in 5 -> but B can be in 1?
- PRIER: P in 1, R in 5
- GRIER: not common? 

Also, ""GRIEV"" not a word.
""FRILL"" not fitting pattern.

So we have several? 

But note: in ""BRIEF"" and ""GRIEF"", they share F in 5? So if F is common? 

Alternatively, ""CHIED"" excluded D? 

Don't see ""H"" possibilities.

I think ""ORIEL"" is a good candidate because it uses O and L, which are common vowels? But we have R,I,E, so vowels might be covered? 

Given that we have only the first and last letters unknown? And we have exclusion for A,S,T,D? So let's choose ""ORIEL""? 

Or ""BRIEF""? 

But to maximize information? If we guess ""ORIEL"", and the answer is ""BRIEF"", we will know? Similarly? 

Since we have high confidence, I'll go with ""GRIEF""? 

But I recall that in the example? The secret word was ""BRISK""? Which isn't? Well, we are not matching? 

Another common word is ""FRIED"" but D excluded? 

Perhaps ""BRIBE"" doesn't fit? 

Wait, there's ""CRIED"" excluded D? 

I think among these, ""BRIEF"" is a word? Or ""GRIEF"". 

But let me choose ""BRIEF"": B-R-I-E-F.

Reasons:
- B and F are common letters not yet tested? 
- It introduces new consonants? 

If feedback shows:
- B: if x? Then not in word? Or if ✓? Then correct? Similarly for F? Then we can deduce? 

For example, if we guess ""BRIEF"" and get:
- B: either ✓ or x? Or minus? 
But note: positions 2,3,4 are fixed? So for position 1: B? And position 5: F? 

The feedback will directly tell? 

If it's correct? We win? If not? Then we try other? 

Similarly? 

But to save guesses? Since one of these must be the answer? 

However, there are several? 

But wait? Is ""GRIEF"" more common? Or ""BRIEF""? 

Typically, ""GRIEF"" might be chosen? 

But I notice that one of the possibilities is ""WRITE"" but T excluded? No? 

Another word: ""DRIVE"" D excluded? 

So let's choose ""GRIEF""? 

But we can also note that in the first guess? R was guessed? Etc? 

I think we should go with ""BRIEF"" or ""GRIEF"". 

I'll choose ""BRIEF"". 

But ""BRIEF"" uses B and F? 

Alternatively, ""ORIEL"" uses O and L? 

To cover? Suppose we guess ""BORER""? But not matching pattern? 

So yes, ""BRIEF"" is a valid choice? 

Perhaps ""URINE"" is excluded because E cannot be in position 5? But for URINE: U-R-I-N-E? Position 5 is E? Which is not allowed? Because we know E is not in position 5? So we cannot use E there? So ""URINE"" is invalid. 

So valid words are non-E in position 5? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""BRIEF"" with this thought? 

But let me confirm: ""BRIEF"" is a 5-letter word? Yes? Meaning short in duration or a report? 

So? 

<guess>BRIEF</guess>? 

But we already used two guesses? This is the third? 

Given that, and to quickly hit? 

Another common option: ""FRIAR""? But not matching? F-R-I-A-R -> position 5 is R? But pattern must be E in position 4? So F-R-I-A-position4? Should be E? Not A. So ""FRIAR"" has A? And A is excluded? So no. 

So decided?Based on the feedback, we can deduce:

1. **Pattern Confirmation**: The feedback from Guess 2 shows that R is correctly placed in the 2nd position (✓), I is correctly placed in the 3rd position (✓), and E is correctly placed in the 4th position (✓). Therefore, the secret word pattern is: _ R I E _.
2. **Fixed Letters**: Positions 2, 3, and 4 are confirmed: R, I, E respectively.
3. **Excluded Letters**: A and S (from Guess 1) and T and D (from Guess 2) are not in the word, so they cannot appear in positions 1 or 5.
4. **Constraints**:
   - Position 1: Must be a letter not A, S, T, D, E, or R (we avoid duplicates unless confirmed; E and R are already placed).
   - Position 5: Must not be E (since Guess 1 proved E cannot be in position 5), and not A, S, T, or D.
5. **Possible Words**: Candidates like ""ORIEL"" (O and L), ""GRIEF"" (G and F), and ""BRIEF"" (B and F) fit the pattern and avoid excluded letters. ""CRIER"" and ""BRIER"" were considered but discarded to avoid duplicate R (not confirmed) and prioritize words with new letters for information gain.

Selected Guess: **BRIEF**  
- Position 1: B (new, common consonant)  
- Position 2: R (fixed)  
- Position 3: I (fixed)  
- Position 4: E (fixed)  
- Position 5: F (new, common consonant)  
This tests the unknown positions efficiently and introduces two new letters (B and F) to refine possibilities.",Guess 3: BRIEF -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) E(✓) F(✓),SUCCESS
