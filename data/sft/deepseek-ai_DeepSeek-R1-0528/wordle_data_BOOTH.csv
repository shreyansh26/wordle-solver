We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given the first guess: ""crane"" and the feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
 This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 So, we need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain any of these letters.

 Important: The word must be composed of letters that are not C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we want to maximize information, we should pick a word with common letters not tried yet.
 Common letters in English: S, T, L, O, etc.

 We should avoid using any of the forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E).

 Let's consider some words:
 - ""south"": has S, O, U, T, H -> none of the forbidden letters? Check: S, O, U, T, H. Yes.
 - ""light"": L, I, G, H, T -> good.
 - ""might"": M, I, G, H, T -> also good.

 But note: we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Another option: ""slyly"" but has duplicate L and Y, might not be great for information.
 Better to have unique letters.

 ""plash"" -> P, L, A -> wait, A is forbidden. We must avoid A (since feedback said A(x) meaning not in word).
 We must avoid A, C, R, N, E.

 So, let's pick a word without A, C, R, N, E and with common letters.

 Consider ""pilot"": P, I, L, O, T -> none of the forbidden letters? 
 Letters: P (ok), I (ok), L (ok), O (ok), T (ok). 

 Another option: ""stomp"": S, T, O, M, P -> good.

 How about ""ghoul"": G, H, O, U, L -> also good.

 We might prefer words with more vowels? But we already ruled out A and E. We have vowels: I, O, U.

 Let's choose a word that includes I and O: for example, ""pious"": P, I, O, U, S -> missing T? But that's okay.

 However, note that we are only on the second guess, so we have plenty of time. We want to cover common letters.

 Another idea: ""split"": S, P, L, I, T -> all distinct and no forbidden letters.

 So, ""split"" is a good candidate because it has S, P, L, I, T which are common and all new.

 Alternatively, ""sight"": S, I, G, H, T -> also good.

 But let's choose one. Let me go with ""split"".

 However, note that we have 6 guesses, and we want to get as much information as possible.

 We might also consider ""sulky"": S, U, L, K, Y -> but has U and Y? Not as common as others.

 I think ""split"" is a solid choice: letters S, P, L, I, T.

 So, next guess: ""split""

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where none of the letters (C, R, A, N, E) are in the secret word, I need a word with entirely new letters. I'll choose ""split"" because it introduces common unused letters like S, P, L, I, T, which maximizes information gain.

We are given two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x) 
  This means that the letters C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Guess 2: split -> S(x) P(x) L(x) I(x) T(-)
  The feedback: 
    S(x) -> S is not in the word.
    P(x) -> P is not in the word.
    L(x) -> L is not in the word.
    I(x) -> I is not in the word.
    T(-) -> T is in the word but in the wrong position.

So, from the feedback we know:
- The secret word contains the letter T, but not in the last position (since in ""split"", T is at the end and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters that are definitely not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I.

We also know that the word is 5 letters long.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
1. Does not contain any of the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I.
2. Must include the letter T (since we know T is in the word) but not in the last position.

What letters are left? We have the following letters available (from the alphabet without the forbidden ones):

Forbidden: A, C, E, I, L, N, P, R, S -> so we avoid these.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: T is in the word, so we must include T in our next guess, but not at the end.

We also want to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.

Let's think of words that:
- Include T (not at the end) and use only the available letters.

Possible positions for T: since it cannot be at the end (because in ""split"" it was at the end and that was wrong), we can try T in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But note: we don't know the correct position of T yet, so we should try it in a different position than the last one.

We also want to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, T, U, V, W, Y.

We might avoid Q, J, X, Z because they are less common.

Let's try to form a word with T in the first position? For example, ""T"" at the start.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters.

Example words:
- ""tough"": T, O, U, G, H -> all available letters? 
  T (ok), O (ok), U (ok), G (ok), H (ok). 
  But we have to check if any forbidden: no A, C, E, I, L, N, P, R, S. So yes.

However, we don't know if O, U, G, H are in the word. This would test several new letters.

But note: the feedback for T in ""split"" was wrong position, so if we put T at the start, that might be a new position to test.

Another word: ""tummy"" -> but has double M? Not ideal for information.

""toddy"" -> double D? Also not ideal.

We want unique letters if possible.

""tango"" -> but A is forbidden? A is in the forbidden list (from guess1: A(x)). So we cannot use A.

We must avoid A, so ""tango"" is invalid.

Another: ""thump"": T, H, U, M, P -> but P is forbidden (from guess2: P(x)). So we cannot use P.

We must avoid P as well.

So, let's list available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Without P, and without A, etc.

So, ""tough"" is valid: T, O, U, G, H.

But we don't know if O, U, G, H are in the word. This is a good candidate.

Another: ""doubt"" -> but T is at the end? We want to avoid putting T at the end because we know that position is wrong. But if we put T at the end, we are testing the same position again? We should avoid that because we know T is not at the end. So we should put T in a different position.

In ""split"", T was at position 5 (the end). So we should try T at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

In ""tough"", T is at position 1.

Another word: ""mothy"": M, O, T, H, Y -> T is at position 3. This is also good.

But ""mothy"" is not a very common word? We need a valid English word.

Another: ""botch"": B, O, T, C -> wait, C is forbidden? C is in the forbidden list (from guess1: C(x)). So we cannot use C.

So ""botch"" is invalid.

""dough"": D, O, U, G, H -> T is missing? We must include T.

We must include T.

So, let's think of words that have T and use only available letters.

Possible words:
- ""tough"" (T at 1)
- ""ought"" (O, U, G, H, T) -> but T is at the end? We want to avoid the end. Also, we are repeating the end position for T which we know is wrong. So not ideal.

- ""month"": but M, O, N, T, H -> N is forbidden (from guess1: N(x)). So invalid.

- ""light"": but L and I are forbidden. Invalid.

- ""fight"": F, I, G, H, T -> I is forbidden. Invalid.

- ""might"": M, I, G, H, T -> I forbidden. Invalid.

- ""thought"": too long, we need 5 letters.

- ""thong"": T, H, O, N, G -> N is forbidden. Invalid.

- ""thick"": T, H, I, C, K -> I and C forbidden. Invalid.

- ""tiger"": T, I, G, E, R -> I and E and R forbidden. Invalid.

- ""tower"": T, O, W, E, R -> E and R forbidden. Invalid.

- ""toyed"": T, O, Y, E, D -> E forbidden. Invalid.

- ""tubed"": T, U, B, E, D -> E forbidden. Invalid.

- ""tuned"": T, U, N, E, D -> N and E forbidden. Invalid.

- ""towed"": T, O, W, E, D -> E forbidden. Invalid.

- ""tamed"": T, A, M, E, D -> A and E forbidden. Invalid.

So, we need to avoid E, A, I, etc.

Let's try with the available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, T, U, V, W, Y.

Word: ""tough"" -> T, O, U, G, H -> valid.

Word: ""dough"" -> but no T? We need T.

Word: ""gouty"": G, O, U, T, Y -> T is at position 4. This is good because we are testing T in a new position (position 4). And the word is valid? Gouty is an adjective meaning relating to gout, but it's acceptable.

Word: ""mothy"": M, O, T, H, Y -> T at position 3. Also valid.

Word: ""bothy"": B, O, T, H, Y -> T at position 3. Valid? Bothy is a Scottish word for a small hut.

But we might prefer more common words.

Another: ""vouch"": V, O, U, C, H -> C is forbidden? C is in the forbidden list. Invalid.

""touch"": T, O, U, C, H -> C forbidden. Invalid.

""tough"" is good.

""tumid"": T, U, M, I, D -> I is forbidden. Invalid.

""tummy"": T, U, M, M, Y -> double M and no I? But M is available. However, double M reduces the number of distinct letters. We want to maximize distinct letters to get more information.

So, ""tough"" has distinct letters: T, O, U, G, H -> 5 distinct.

Similarly, ""gouty"" has G, O, U, T, Y -> 5 distinct.

""mothy"" has M, O, T, H, Y -> 5 distinct.

""bothy"" has B, O, T, H, Y -> 5 distinct.

We can also try ""fouth"": F, O, U, T, H -> T at position 4. But is ""fouth"" a word? It might be archaic meaning abundant. But Wordle might accept it? We should stick to common words.

Another common word: ""duty"" -> only 4 letters. We need 5.

""toque"": T, O, Q, U, E -> E forbidden and Q is rare. Also, E is forbidden.

""toked"": T, O, K, E, D -> E forbidden.

""toked"" is invalid because of E.

""toked"" is not allowed.

""youth"": Y, O, U, T, H -> T at position 4. This is a common word. And letters: Y, O, U, T, H -> all available? 
Y (ok), O (ok), U (ok), T (ok), H (ok). And no forbidden letters.

So ""youth"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, ""mouth"": M, O, U, T, H -> T at position 4. But we don't know if M is available? We haven't tried M. But ""mouth"" is common.

But note: we have to avoid forbidden letters. M is not forbidden? Yes, because we haven't eliminated M. So ""mouth"" is valid.

However, we have two good options: ""tough"", ""youth"", ""mouth"", ""gouty"", etc.

But we also want to test T in a position that is not the last. In ""youth"", T is at position 4 (if we count: Y-1, O-2, U-3, T-4, H-5). So position 4 is new (previously T was at 5).

Similarly, in ""tough"", T is at position 1.

Which one to choose? We want to maximize the information. We can choose a word that has T in a position we haven't tested. We tested T at position 5 (in ""split"") and it was wrong. So we should test a different position.

We can choose either position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But note: we don't know the correct position, so we should pick a position that might be likely? Or just pick one to test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in the middle to see if it fits there.

But without more information, any position is fine.

I think ""youth"" is a good choice because it is a common word and it tests T at position 4 and also tests Y, O, U, H.

Similarly, ""tough"" tests T at position 1 and O, U, G, H.

Another word: ""ought"" -> but T is at the end, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

I'll go with ""youth"" because it's a very common word.

But note: we are also testing the letter Y. Y is less common than G? But it's acceptable.

Alternatively, ""tough"" is also common.

Let me choose ""tough"" to test T at the start.

So, next guess: ""tough""

But wait, we have another option: ""mouth"" is also common and tests M and O, U, H.

We don't have a strong reason to prefer one over the other.

I think ""mouth"" is a very common word and might be a good test.

But let's see: we know T is in the word, so we must include T. ""mouth"" includes T at position 4? 
M-O-U-T-H -> positions: M(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), H(5). So T is at position 4.

Similarly, ""youth"" has T at position 4.

In ""tough"", T is at position 1.

We might get more information by putting T in a position we haven't tried. We tried position 5 (wrong) and now we try position 1 or 4.

I think either is fine.

But note: if we put T at position 1 and it turns out to be correct, we get a green, which is good. If it's wrong, we know it's not at position 1.

Similarly for position 4.

I'll go with ""tough"" to test the first position.

So, guess: ""tough""

But let me confirm the letters: T, O, U, G, H -> none of these are forbidden? 
T: we know it's in the word, but we are testing position.
O: new
U: new
G: new
H: new

All are allowed.

So, we'll guess ""tough"".

After analyzing the feedback:
- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- From Guess 2 (""split""): S, P, L, I are not in the word, but T is in the word (wrong position, so not at the end).

The secret word contains T (not in position 5) and excludes C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I. For the next guess, I need a word that:
- Includes T (in a position other than 5).
- Uses only remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- Maximizes new letter coverage (e.g., common letters like O, U, H, G).

I chose ""tough"" because:
- It places T in position 1 (a new position to test).
- It introduces new common letters: O, U, G, H.
- All letters are distinct and allowed.
- It's a valid English word.

<guess>tough</guess>",tough,"We are given two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x) 
  This means that the letters C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Guess 2: split -> S(x) P(x) L(x) I(x) T(-)
  The feedback: 
    S(x) -> S is not in the word.
    P(x) -> P is not in the word.
    L(x) -> L is not in the word.
    I(x) -> I is not in the word.
    T(-) -> T is in the word but in the wrong position.

So, from the feedback we know:
- The secret word contains the letter T, but not in the last position (since in ""split"", T is at the end and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters that are definitely not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I.

We also know that the word is 5 letters long.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
1. Does not contain any of the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I.
2. Must include the letter T (since we know T is in the word) but not in the last position.

What letters are left? We have the following letters available (from the alphabet without the forbidden ones):

Forbidden: A, C, E, I, L, N, P, R, S -> so we avoid these.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: T is in the word, so we must include T in our next guess, but not at the end.

We also want to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.

Let's think of words that:
- Include T (not at the end) and use only the available letters.

Possible positions for T: since it cannot be at the end (because in ""split"" it was at the end and that was wrong), we can try T in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But note: we don't know the correct position of T yet, so we should try it in a different position than the last one.

We also want to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, T, U, V, W, Y.

We might avoid Q, J, X, Z because they are less common.

Let's try to form a word with T in the first position? For example, ""T"" at the start.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters.

Example words:
- ""tough"": T, O, U, G, H -> all available letters? 
  T (ok), O (ok), U (ok), G (ok), H (ok). 
  But we have to check if any forbidden: no A, C, E, I, L, N, P, R, S. So yes.

However, we don't know if O, U, G, H are in the word. This would test several new letters.

But note: the feedback for T in ""split"" was wrong position, so if we put T at the start, that might be a new position to test.

Another word: ""tummy"" -> but has double M? Not ideal for information.

""toddy"" -> double D? Also not ideal.

We want unique letters if possible.

""tango"" -> but A is forbidden? A is in the forbidden list (from guess1: A(x)). So we cannot use A.

We must avoid A, so ""tango"" is invalid.

Another: ""thump"": T, H, U, M, P -> but P is forbidden (from guess2: P(x)). So we cannot use P.

We must avoid P as well.

So, let's list available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Without P, and without A, etc.

So, ""tough"" is valid: T, O, U, G, H.

But we don't know if O, U, G, H are in the word. This is a good candidate.

Another: ""doubt"" -> but T is at the end? We want to avoid putting T at the end because we know that position is wrong. But if we put T at the end, we are testing the same position again? We should avoid that because we know T is not at the end. So we should put T in a different position.

In ""split"", T was at position 5 (the end). So we should try T at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

In ""tough"", T is at position 1.

Another word: ""mothy"": M, O, T, H, Y -> T is at position 3. This is also good.

But ""mothy"" is not a very common word? We need a valid English word.

Another: ""botch"": B, O, T, C -> wait, C is forbidden? C is in the forbidden list (from guess1: C(x)). So we cannot use C.

So ""botch"" is invalid.

""dough"": D, O, U, G, H -> T is missing? We must include T.

We must include T.

So, let's think of words that have T and use only available letters.

Possible words:
- ""tough"" (T at 1)
- ""ought"" (O, U, G, H, T) -> but T is at the end? We want to avoid the end. Also, we are repeating the end position for T which we know is wrong. So not ideal.

- ""month"": but M, O, N, T, H -> N is forbidden (from guess1: N(x)). So invalid.

- ""light"": but L and I are forbidden. Invalid.

- ""fight"": F, I, G, H, T -> I is forbidden. Invalid.

- ""might"": M, I, G, H, T -> I forbidden. Invalid.

- ""thought"": too long, we need 5 letters.

- ""thong"": T, H, O, N, G -> N is forbidden. Invalid.

- ""thick"": T, H, I, C, K -> I and C forbidden. Invalid.

- ""tiger"": T, I, G, E, R -> I and E and R forbidden. Invalid.

- ""tower"": T, O, W, E, R -> E and R forbidden. Invalid.

- ""toyed"": T, O, Y, E, D -> E forbidden. Invalid.

- ""tubed"": T, U, B, E, D -> E forbidden. Invalid.

- ""tuned"": T, U, N, E, D -> N and E forbidden. Invalid.

- ""towed"": T, O, W, E, D -> E forbidden. Invalid.

- ""tamed"": T, A, M, E, D -> A and E forbidden. Invalid.

So, we need to avoid E, A, I, etc.

Let's try with the available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, T, U, V, W, Y.

Word: ""tough"" -> T, O, U, G, H -> valid.

Word: ""dough"" -> but no T? We need T.

Word: ""gouty"": G, O, U, T, Y -> T is at position 4. This is good because we are testing T in a new position (position 4). And the word is valid? Gouty is an adjective meaning relating to gout, but it's acceptable.

But we might prefer more common words.

""tummy"": T, U, M, M, Y -> double M and no I? But M is available. However, double M reduces the number of distinct letters. We want to maximize distinct letters to get more information.

So, ""tough"" has distinct letters: T, O, U, G, H -> 5 distinct.

Similarly, ""gouty"" has G, O, U, T, Y -> 5 distinct.

""mothy"" has M, O, T, H, Y -> 5 distinct.

""bothy"" has B, O, T, H, Y -> 5 distinct.

We can also try ""fouth"": F, O, U, T, H -> T at position 4. But is ""fouth"" a word? It might be archaic meaning abundant. But Wordle might accept it? We should stick to common words.

But note: we have to avoid forbidden letters. M is not forbidden? Yes, because we haven't eliminated M. So ""mouth"" is valid.

However, we have two good options: ""tough"", ""youth"", ""mouth"", ""gouty"", etc.

I think ""mouth"" is a very common word and might be a good test.

But let's see: we know T is in the word, so we must include T. ""mouth"" includes T at position 4? 
M-O-U-T-H -> positions: M(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), H(5). So T is at position 4.

Similarly, ""youth"" has T at position 4.

In ""tough"", T is at position 1.

We might get more information by putting T in a position we haven't tried. We tried position 5 (wrong) and now we try position 1 or 4.

I think either is fine.

But note: if we put T at position 1 and it turns out to be correct, we get a green, which is good. If it's wrong, we know it's not at position 1.

Similarly for position 4.

I'll go with ""tough"" to test the first position.

So, guess: ""tough""

But let me confirm the letters: T, O, U, G, H -> none of these are forbidden? 
T: we know it's in the word, but we are testing position.
O: new
U: new
G: new

All are allowed.

So, we'll guess ""tough"".

 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the first guess: ""crane"" and the feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
 This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 So, we need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain any of these letters.

 Important: The word must be composed of letters that are not C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we want to maximize information, we should pick a word with common letters not tried yet.
 Common letters in English: S, T, L, O, etc.

 We should avoid using any of the forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E).

 Let's consider some words:
 - ""south"": has S, O, U, T, H -> none of the forbidden letters? Check: S, O, U, T, H. Yes.
 - ""light"": L, I, G, H, T -> good.
 - ""might"": M, I, G, H, T -> also good.

 But note: we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Another option: ""slyly"" but has duplicate L and Y, might not be great for information.
 Better to have unique letters.

 ""plash"" -> P, L, A -> wait, A is forbidden. We must avoid A (since feedback said A(x) meaning not in word).
 We must avoid A, C, R, N, E.

 So, let's pick a word without A, C, R, N, E and with common letters.

 Consider ""pilot"": P, I, L, O, T -> none of the forbidden letters? 
 Letters: P (ok), I (ok), L (ok), O (ok), T (ok). 

 Another option: ""stomp"": S, T, O, M, P -> good.

 How about ""ghoul"": G, H, O, U, L -> also good.

 We might prefer words with more vowels? But we already ruled out A and E. We have vowels: I, O, U.

 Let's choose a word that includes I and O: for example, ""pious"": P, I, O, U, S -> missing T? But that's okay.

 However, note that we are only on the second guess, so we have plenty of time. We want to cover common letters.

 Another idea: ""split"": S, P, L, I, T -> all distinct and no forbidden letters.

 So, ""split"" is a good candidate because it has S, P, L, I, T which are common and all new.

 Alternatively, ""sight"": S, I, G, H, T -> also good.

 But let's choose one. Let me go with ""split"".

 However, note that we have 6 guesses, and we want to get as much information as possible.

 We might also consider ""sulky"": S, U, L, K, Y -> but has U and Y? Not as common as others.

 I think ""split"" is a solid choice: letters S, P, L, I, T.

 So, next guess: ""split""

<guess>split</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where none of the letters (C, R, A, N, E) are in the secret word, I need a word with entirely new letters. I'll choose ""split"" because it introduces common unused letters like S, P, L, I, T, which maximizes information gain.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: split -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) L(x) I(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x) 
  This means that the letters C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Guess 2: split -> S(x) P(x) L(x) I(x) T(-)
  The feedback: 
    S(x) -> S is not in the word.
    P(x) -> P is not in the word.
    L(x) -> L is not in the word.
    I(x) -> I is not in the word.
    T(-) -> T is in the word but in the wrong position.

So, from the feedback we know:
- The secret word contains the letter T, but not in the last position (since in ""split"", T is at the end and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters that are definitely not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I.

We also know that the word is 5 letters long.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
1. Does not contain any of the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I.
2. Must include the letter T (since we know T is in the word) but not in the last position.

What letters are left? We have the following letters available (from the alphabet without the forbidden ones):

Forbidden: A, C, E, I, L, N, P, R, S -> so we avoid these.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: T is in the word, so we must include T in our next guess, but not at the end.

We also want to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.

Let's think of words that:
- Include T (not at the end) and use only the available letters.

Possible positions for T: since it cannot be at the end (because in ""split"" it was at the end and that was wrong), we can try T in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But note: we don't know the correct position of T yet, so we should try it in a different position than the last one.

We also want to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, T, U, V, W, Y.

We might avoid Q, J, X, Z because they are less common.

Let's try to form a word with T in the first position? For example, ""T"" at the start.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters.

Example words:
- ""tough"": T, O, U, G, H -> all available letters? 
  T (ok), O (ok), U (ok), G (ok), H (ok). 
  But we have to check if any forbidden: no A, C, E, I, L, N, P, R, S. So yes.

However, we don't know if O, U, G, H are in the word. This would test several new letters.

But note: the feedback for T in ""split"" was wrong position, so if we put T at the start, that might be a new position to test.

Another word: ""tummy"" -> but has double M? Not ideal for information.

""toddy"" -> double D? Also not ideal.

We want unique letters if possible.

""tango"" -> but A is forbidden? A is in the forbidden list (from guess1: A(x)). So we cannot use A.

We must avoid A, so ""tango"" is invalid.

Another: ""thump"": T, H, U, M, P -> but P is forbidden (from guess2: P(x)). So we cannot use P.

We must avoid P as well.

So, let's list available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Without P, and without A, etc.

So, ""tough"" is valid: T, O, U, G, H.

But we don't know if O, U, G, H are in the word. This is a good candidate.

Another: ""doubt"" -> but T is at the end? We want to avoid putting T at the end because we know that position is wrong. But if we put T at the end, we are testing the same position again? We should avoid that because we know T is not at the end. So we should put T in a different position.

In ""split"", T was at position 5 (the end). So we should try T at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

In ""tough"", T is at position 1.

Another word: ""mothy"": M, O, T, H, Y -> T is at position 3. This is also good.

But ""mothy"" is not a very common word? We need a valid English word.

Another: ""botch"": B, O, T, C -> wait, C is forbidden? C is in the forbidden list (from guess1: C(x)). So we cannot use C.

So ""botch"" is invalid.

""dough"": D, O, U, G, H -> T is missing? We must include T.

We must include T.

So, let's think of words that have T and use only available letters.

Possible words:
- ""tough"" (T at 1)
- ""ought"" (O, U, G, H, T) -> but T is at the end? We want to avoid the end. Also, we are repeating the end position for T which we know is wrong. So not ideal.

- ""month"": but M, O, N, T, H -> N is forbidden (from guess1: N(x)). So invalid.

- ""light"": but L and I are forbidden. Invalid.

- ""fight"": F, I, G, H, T -> I is forbidden. Invalid.

- ""might"": M, I, G, H, T -> I forbidden. Invalid.

- ""thought"": too long, we need 5 letters.

- ""thong"": T, H, O, N, G -> N is forbidden. Invalid.

- ""thick"": T, H, I, C, K -> I and C forbidden. Invalid.

- ""tiger"": T, I, G, E, R -> I and E and R forbidden. Invalid.

- ""tower"": T, O, W, E, R -> E and R forbidden. Invalid.

- ""toyed"": T, O, Y, E, D -> E forbidden. Invalid.

- ""tubed"": T, U, B, E, D -> E forbidden. Invalid.

- ""tuned"": T, U, N, E, D -> N and E forbidden. Invalid.

- ""towed"": T, O, W, E, D -> E forbidden. Invalid.

- ""tamed"": T, A, M, E, D -> A and E forbidden. Invalid.

So, we need to avoid E, A, I, etc.

Let's try with the available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, T, U, V, W, Y.

Word: ""tough"" -> T, O, U, G, H -> valid.

Word: ""dough"" -> but no T? We need T.

Word: ""gouty"": G, O, U, T, Y -> T is at position 4. This is good because we are testing T in a new position (position 4). And the word is valid? Gouty is an adjective meaning relating to gout, but it's acceptable.

Word: ""mothy"": M, O, T, H, Y -> T at position 3. Also valid.

Word: ""bothy"": B, O, T, H, Y -> T at position 3. Valid? Bothy is a Scottish word for a small hut.

But we might prefer more common words.

Another: ""vouch"": V, O, U, C, H -> C is forbidden? C is in the forbidden list. Invalid.

""touch"": T, O, U, C, H -> C forbidden. Invalid.

""tough"" is good.

""tumid"": T, U, M, I, D -> I is forbidden. Invalid.

""tummy"": T, U, M, M, Y -> double M and no I? But M is available. However, double M reduces the number of distinct letters. We want to maximize distinct letters to get more information.

So, ""tough"" has distinct letters: T, O, U, G, H -> 5 distinct.

Similarly, ""gouty"" has G, O, U, T, Y -> 5 distinct.

""mothy"" has M, O, T, H, Y -> 5 distinct.

""bothy"" has B, O, T, H, Y -> 5 distinct.

We can also try ""fouth"": F, O, U, T, H -> T at position 4. But is ""fouth"" a word? It might be archaic meaning abundant. But Wordle might accept it? We should stick to common words.

Another common word: ""duty"" -> only 4 letters. We need 5.

""toque"": T, O, Q, U, E -> E forbidden and Q is rare. Also, E is forbidden.

""toked"": T, O, K, E, D -> E forbidden.

""toked"" is invalid because of E.

""toked"" is not allowed.

""youth"": Y, O, U, T, H -> T at position 4. This is a common word. And letters: Y, O, U, T, H -> all available? 
Y (ok), O (ok), U (ok), T (ok), H (ok). And no forbidden letters.

So ""youth"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, ""mouth"": M, O, U, T, H -> T at position 4. But we don't know if M is available? We haven't tried M. But ""mouth"" is common.

But note: we have to avoid forbidden letters. M is not forbidden? Yes, because we haven't eliminated M. So ""mouth"" is valid.

However, we have two good options: ""tough"", ""youth"", ""mouth"", ""gouty"", etc.

But we also want to test T in a position that is not the last. In ""youth"", T is at position 4 (if we count: Y-1, O-2, U-3, T-4, H-5). So position 4 is new (previously T was at 5).

Similarly, in ""tough"", T is at position 1.

Which one to choose? We want to maximize the information. We can choose a word that has T in a position we haven't tested. We tested T at position 5 (in ""split"") and it was wrong. So we should test a different position.

We can choose either position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But note: we don't know the correct position, so we should pick a position that might be likely? Or just pick one to test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in the middle to see if it fits there.

But without more information, any position is fine.

I think ""youth"" is a good choice because it is a common word and it tests T at position 4 and also tests Y, O, U, H.

Similarly, ""tough"" tests T at position 1 and O, U, G, H.

Another word: ""ought"" -> but T is at the end, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

I'll go with ""youth"" because it's a very common word.

But note: we are also testing the letter Y. Y is less common than G? But it's acceptable.

Alternatively, ""tough"" is also common.

Let me choose ""tough"" to test T at the start.

So, next guess: ""tough""

But wait, we have another option: ""mouth"" is also common and tests M and O, U, H.

We don't have a strong reason to prefer one over the other.

I think ""mouth"" is a very common word and might be a good test.

But let's see: we know T is in the word, so we must include T. ""mouth"" includes T at position 4? 
M-O-U-T-H -> positions: M(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), H(5). So T is at position 4.

Similarly, ""youth"" has T at position 4.

In ""tough"", T is at position 1.

We might get more information by putting T in a position we haven't tried. We tried position 5 (wrong) and now we try position 1 or 4.

I think either is fine.

But note: if we put T at position 1 and it turns out to be correct, we get a green, which is good. If it's wrong, we know it's not at position 1.

Similarly for position 4.

I'll go with ""tough"" to test the first position.

So, guess: ""tough""

But let me confirm the letters: T, O, U, G, H -> none of these are forbidden? 
T: we know it's in the word, but we are testing position.
O: new
U: new
G: new
H: new

All are allowed.

So, we'll guess ""tough"".

<guess>tough</guess>After analyzing the feedback:
- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- From Guess 2 (""split""): S, P, L, I are not in the word, but T is in the word (wrong position, so not at the end).

The secret word contains T (not in position 5) and excludes C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I. For the next guess, I need a word that:
- Includes T (in a position other than 5).
- Uses only remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- Maximizes new letter coverage (e.g., common letters like O, U, H, G).

I chose ""tough"" because:
- It places T in position 1 (a new position to test).
- It introduces new common letters: O, U, G, H.
- All letters are distinct and allowed.
- It's a valid English word.

We are given the feedback for the third guess ""tough"":
  T(-) -> T is in the word but not in position 1.
  O(✓) -> O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
  U(x) -> U is not in the word.
  G(x) -> G is not in the word.
  H(✓) -> H is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So, from this:
- The secret word has O in the second position and H in the fifth position.
- T is in the word but not at position 1 (we already knew it's not at position 5 from guess2, so now not at 1 or 5).
- U and G are not in the word.

Also, from previous guesses, we know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I, U, G.

Now, the secret word pattern: _ O _ _ H

We know T is in the word, but not at position 1 or 5. So it must be at position 3 or 4.

We also know the word does not contain: A, C, E, G, I, L, N, P, R, S, U.

Available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: H and O are already placed, so we don't need to guess them again? But we are going to guess the entire word.

We have two positions to fill: position 1 and positions 3 and 4 (but note: T must be in one of 3 or 4, and the other letter is unknown).

Actually, the word has 5 positions:
1: unknown, but cannot be T (from feedback: T(-) in position1) and must be from available letters.
2: O (fixed)
3: unknown, but could be T or another letter.
4: unknown, but could be T or another letter (but T must be in either 3 or 4).
5: H (fixed)

So, the word is: [letter1] O [letter3 or T] [letter4 or T] H

But T must be in one of the two middle positions (3 or 4). The other middle position is a different letter.

We need to find a word that fits: 
  Position 1: one of B, D, F, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (since T is not allowed at 1, and H and O are already placed, and we avoid forbidden letters).
  Position 3: either T or one of the available letters (but if it's not T, then T must be at position 4).
  Position 4: similarly.

But note: we have to use only available letters and include T.

Also, we have to avoid the forbidden letters.

Let's list the available letters for position 1: 
  We cannot use: A, C, E, G, I, L, N, P, R, S, U, and also T is not allowed at position 1, and O and H are fixed at 2 and 5.
  So available: B, D, F, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For positions 3 and 4: 
  We must have T in one of them, and the other must be from the available letters (same set, but note that H and O are already used, but they can be repeated? The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates, but typically Wordle words can have duplicates? However, in this case, we don't have any indication of duplicates so far, and the word might be without duplicates.

But to be safe, we should consider that the word might have duplicates. However, since we have H and O already, and if we put H again? But we don't know. But in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback.

But let's assume the word has no duplicates for now, because we haven't encountered any. So we avoid using O and H again in positions 1,3,4.

So, for positions 1,3,4: we must use three distinct letters from: B, D, F, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. And one of positions 3 or 4 must be T.

So, the word is: [1] O [3] [4] H, with [3] and [4] being two distinct letters from the available set, and one of them is T.

Now, we need to make a guess that fits this pattern and uses the available letters.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Possible words:

We need to fill:
  Position 1: one letter from B, D, F, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
  Position 3: either T or a new letter (but if not T, then position 4 must be T).
  Position 4: similarly.

But we don't know which of 3 or 4 is T. So we have two cases.

We can try to pick a word that has T in position 3 and a new letter in 1 and 4, or T in position 4 and new letters in 1 and 3.

We should choose a word that is common and uses common letters.

Let's try to find words that end with ""O?H"" but with the pattern: _ O _ _ H

For example, if T is in position 3: then the pattern is _ O T _ H. What words? 
  Position 1: must be a consonant (since it's the start) and from the available set.
  Position 4: must be a letter from available set (without T, O, H, and the letter at position1).

Possible: 
  ""M O T T H"" -> but T repeated? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, T would be at 3 and 4? But we need distinct? And also, we have two T's? But the feedback from ""tough"" had T only once? Actually, the feedback for ""tough"" had T marked as present but wrong position, but it didn't say how many. So there could be two T's? But we don't know.

But to be safe, let's avoid duplicates for now.

So, if T is at position 3: then position 4 must be a different letter.

Words: 
  ""M O T H ?"" -> but we have H at the end? The pattern is _ O T _ H -> so the last is H, so it's ""O T ? H"" but that's positions 2,3,4,5: so the word is [1] O T [4] H.

What are some words? 
  ""M O T H H"" -> duplicate H? Not allowed? And not a word.
  ""B O T H H"" -> same.
  ""D O T C H"" -> C is forbidden.
  ""F O T H"" -> not 5 letters? We need 5: F O T ? H -> so F O T X H? ""fotxh"" is not a word.

Common words: 
  ""w o t h"" -> not 5 letters? We need 5.

Actually, I can't think of a common word with the pattern _ O T _ H.

Now, if T is at position 4: then the pattern is _ O _ T H.

Words: 
  ""C O M T H"" -> C forbidden.
  ""D O U T H"" -> U is forbidden (from guess3: U(x)).
  ""F O O T H"" -> duplicate O? And O is already at position2, so if we put O at position3, then we have two O's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, ""footh"" is not a word.
  ""M O O T H"" -> again, duplicate O and not a common word? ""moot"" is 4 letters.
  ""B O O T H"" -> duplicate O, and ""booth"" is a word. But we have O at position2 and then O at position3? That would be two O's.

But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. The feedback so far hasn't indicated duplicates, but it's possible.

In ""booth"", we have two O's and two H's? No: B-O-O-T-H -> two O's and one H? But we have H at position5, so if we put O at position3, that's two O's.

But we have to consider: if the word has two O's, then in the feedback for ""tough"", we had O at position2 correct, but we didn't have an O in any other position? In ""tough"", we only had one O at position2. So if the secret word has two O's, then when we guessed ""tough"", we would have gotten one O correct (position2) and the other O would have been marked as present if it was in the word? But in ""tough"", we didn't have a second O, so we wouldn't get feedback for the second O.

So it's possible that the word has two O's? But we don't have evidence.

Similarly, for H: we have H at position5 correct. If the word has another H, we don't know.

But to keep it simple, let's first assume no duplicates. Then, we cannot use O or H again in positions 1,3,4.

So, for the pattern _ O _ T H (if T is at 4): 
  Position 1: available letter (not O, H, T, and not forbidden)
  Position 3: available letter (not O, H, T, and not forbidden)

Similarly, for _ O T _ H: 
  Position 1: available letter
  Position 4: available letter

But we are struggling to find common words.

Let me list possible words that fit the pattern and use available letters.

Pattern: [1] O [3] [4] H

With [3] and [4] being two distinct letters from the available set, and one of them is T.

Available letters for 1,3,4: B, D, F, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. (and we must use T in either 3 or 4)

Case 1: T at position 3 -> pattern: [1] O T [4] H
  We need a word: [1]OT[4]H
  [1] must be consonant, [4] must be vowel or consonant? But it's the fourth letter.

Possible words:
  ""M O T H H"" -> invalid, duplicate H and not a word.
  ""B O T H"" -> too short? We need 5 letters: B O T ? H -> so 5th is H, so it's B O T [4] H -> 5 letters. What can [4] be?
    With available letters: B, D, F, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. But T is at 3, so [4] cannot be T? And we avoid duplicates? So [4] is one of D, F, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  But what words? 
    ""B O T C H"" -> C forbidden.
    ""B O T H H"" -> invalid.
    ""M O T H"" -> too short.

  I can't think of a common word. 

  ""Y O T H"" -> too short.

  ""J O T H"" -> not a word? Jot is 3 letters.

  This pattern might not yield common words.

Case 2: T at position 4 -> pattern: [1] O [3] T H
  We need a word: [1]O[3]TH

  [1] and [3] from available letters (without T, O, H) and distinct.

  Available: B, D, F, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  What words?
    ""B O M T H"" -> M is available, ""bomth"" is not a word.
    ""D O M T H"" -> ""domth"" not a word.
    ""F O M T H"" -> no.
    ""J O K T H"" -> ""jokth"" not a word.
    ""M O T T H"" -> duplicate T? And ""motth"" not a word.
    ""W O M T H"" -> no.

  But there is ""month"", but N is forbidden (from guess1: N(x)).

  ""both"" is 4 letters.

  ""doth"": D O T H -> 4 letters.

  ""moth"": M O T H -> 4 letters.

  How about 5 letters? 

  ""booth"": B O O T H -> but this has two O's. And O is at position2 and position3? So duplicate O.

  ""booty"": but ends with Y, not H.

  ""sooth"": but S is forbidden.

  ""tooth"": T O O T H -> T at position1? But we know T is not at position1 (from feedback of ""tough"": T(-) at position1). Also, S is not in it? But ""tooth"" has T at 1 and 2? But we have O at position2, so if we put T at1, it's not allowed because T is not at1. Also, ""tooth"" has two O's and two T's.

  But let's consider duplicates: if we allow duplicates, then ""booth"" is a word: B O O T H -> positions: B(1), O(2), O(3), T(4), H(5). 

  Now, check against feedback:
    We know O is at position2: yes, in ""booth"", position2 is O -> correct.
    H is at position5: yes.
    T is in the word: in ""booth"", T is at position4 -> so it should be marked as present? But in the pattern, we have T at position4, which is not the same as the previous T position? Previously T was at position1 in ""tough"" and it was wrong, and at position5 in ""split"" and it was wrong. Now at position4.

  Also, we have two O's: but in ""tough"", we only guessed one O (at position2) and it was correct. We didn't guess the other O, so that's fine.

  But we also have to check the forbidden letters: ""booth"" has B, O, O, T, H. 
    B: not forbidden? 
    O: already known
    T: known
    H: known

  Forbidden letters: not in the list.

  So ""booth"" is a candidate.

  Another candidate: ""moody"" -> but doesn't end with H.

  ""goodh"" -> not a word.

  ""goth"" is 4 letters.

  Another word: ""bothy"" -> B O T H Y -> but that's 5 letters: B(1), O(2), T(3), H(4), Y(5). But we need H at position5, not at position4. In ""bothy"", H is at position4, but we need it at position5. So not matching.

  ""dowth"" -> not a word.

  ""fouth"" -> F O U T H -> but U is forbidden (from guess3: U(x)).

  ""youth"" -> Y O U T H -> U is forbidden? Yes, U(x) in guess3. So we cannot use U.

  So ""booth"" is a possibility.

  Another word: ""vouch"" -> V O U C H -> U and C forbidden.

  ""jotun"" -> not ending with H.

  ""booth"" seems to be a valid word that fits the pattern if we allow duplicate O.

  But we have to consider: in the feedback for ""tough"", we had O at position2 correct, and we didn't get any indication of a second O. That's fine because we didn't guess it.

  Also, T is at position4, which is new.

  But we also have to check if B is allowed? B is not in the forbidden list.

  So ""booth"" is a candidate.

  Are there other words? 

  ""mooty"" -> not ending with H.

  ""footy"" -> not ending with H.

  ""sooty"" -> S forbidden.

  ""boots"" -> ends with S, not H.

  ""booth"" is the only common word I can think of.

  But what about ""dhoti""? D H O T I -> but pattern: D(1), H(2)? But we need O at position2. So not.

  Another: ""johns"" -> not.

  So perhaps ""booth"" is a good guess.

  But we have to confirm: the pattern is [1] O [3] [4] H. In ""booth"": 
    Position1: B
    Position2: O (correct)
    Position3: O (duplicate)
    Position4: T
    Position5: H (correct)

  This matches.

  But we have two O's. Is that allowed? The game allows duplicate letters.

  Also, we haven't used B before, so it's new.

  But we are not sure if T is at position4. It could be at position3.

  However, we don't have a good word for T at position3.

  Another possibility: T at position3 and then position4 is a letter that can form a word.

  For example, ""mothy"": but we have M O T H Y -> but H is at position4? We need H at position5. So ""mothy"" is M(1) O(2) T(3) H(4) Y(5) -> but then position5 is Y, not H. And we need position5 to be H.

  ""moth"" is 4 letters.

  ""bothy"": B O T H Y -> B(1) O(2) T(3) H(4) Y(5) -> but then position4 is H, but we need position5 to be H. So not.

  ""tophi"": T O P H I -> P and I forbidden.

  So no common word for T at position3.

  Therefore, the only common word we have is ""booth"".

  But let's check if there is a word with T at position4 and no duplicate.

  For example, ""dowth"" is not a word.

  ""howth"" not a word.

  ""jowth"" not a word.

  ""kowth"" not a word.

  ""mowth"" not a word.

  ""nowth"" not a word.

  ""rowth"" not a word.

  ""vowth"" not a word.

  ""wowth"" not a word.

  ""yowth"" not a word.

  ""zowth"" not a word.

  So, it seems ""booth"" is the best candidate.

  But we have to consider: what if the word has no duplicate? Then we must find a word without duplicate O.

  In that case, we might need to try a different approach.

  Another idea: the word could be ""fouth"" but U is forbidden.

  Or ""youth"" but U forbidden.

  So no.

  What about ""doth"" with an extra letter? No.

  Perhaps we missed a word.

  Let me think: words ending with ""th"": 
    ""berth"" -> but E and R forbidden.
    ""birth"" -> I forbidden? I is in the forbidden list (from guess2: I(x)).
    ""girth"" -> G and I forbidden.
    ""mirth"" -> M, I, R -> R forbidden.
    ""worth"" -> W, O, R, T, H -> but R forbidden.
    ""firth"" -> F, I, R -> I and R forbidden.
    ""kith"" -> too short.
    ""pith"" -> P and I forbidden.

  All have forbidden letters.

  So, the only possibility is ""booth"" with duplicate O.

  Therefore, I will guess ""booth"".

  But note: in ""booth"", we have O at position3 as well. We don't know if that is allowed, but it's a valid word.

  So, next guess: ""booth""

  But let's see the feedback we might get.

  If the secret word is ""booth"", then we get it right.

  If not, we get feedback that might help.

  Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests more letters, but we are constrained by the fixed O and H.

  We have to include T and the pattern.

  Another word: ""mothy"" doesn't fit because of the H position.

  ""tophi"" is invalid.

  So, I think ""booth"" is the best guess.

  But wait, we have not used M, for example. We could try ""moth"" but it's 4 letters.

  Or ""month"" is invalid.

  So, I'll go with ""booth"".

<guess>booth</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2 (split)**: S, P, L, I are not in the word, but T is present (wrong position, so not at position 5).
- **Guess 3 (tough)**:
  - T is present but not at position 1 (and not at 5, from guess 2).
  - O is correct and in position 2.
  - U is not in the word.
  - G is not in the word.
  - H is correct and in position 5.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ O _ _ H`.
- T must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1 or 5, so it must be in position 3 or 4.
- Excluded letters: A, C, E, G, I, L, N, P, R, S, U.
- Available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but H and O are already placed, so they cannot be reused in other positions unless duplicates are allowed).
- Given the constraints, the only common English word fitting the pattern `_ O _ _ H` with T in position 4 (and allowing a duplicate O) is **""booth""**:
  - B (position 1, new letter),
  - O (position 2, correct and fixed),
  - O (position 3, duplicate O),
  - T (position 4, T placed here for testing),
  - H (position 5, correct and fixed).

This guess tests the possibility of T in position 4 and checks for duplicate O, while using valid letters.

<guess>booth</guess>",booth,"We are given the feedback for the third guess ""tough"":
  T(-) -> T is in the word but not in position 1.
  O(✓) -> O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
  U(x) -> U is not in the word.
  G(x) -> G is not in the word.
  H(✓) -> H is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So, from this:
- The secret word has O in the second position and H in the fifth position.
- T is in the word but not at position 1 (we already knew it's not at position 5 from guess2, so now not at 1 or 5).
- U and G are not in the word.

Also, from previous guesses, we know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I, U, G.

Now, the secret word pattern: _ O _ _ H

We know T is in the word, but not at position 1 or 5. So it must be at position 3 or 4.

We also know the word does not contain: A, C, E, G, I, L, N, P, R, S, U.

Available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: H and O are already placed, so we don't need to guess them again? But we are going to guess the entire word.

We have two positions to fill: position 1 and positions 3 and 4 (but note: T must be in one of 3 or 4, and the other letter is unknown).

Actually, the word has 5 positions:
1: unknown, but cannot be T (from feedback: T(-) in position1) and must be from available letters.
2: O (fixed)
3: unknown, but could be T or another letter.
4: unknown, but could be T or another letter (but T must be in either 3 or 4).
5: H (fixed)

So, the word is: [letter1] O [letter3 or T] [letter4 or T] H

But T must be in one of the two middle positions (3 or 4). The other middle position is a different letter.

We need to find a word that fits: 
  Position 1: one of B, D, F, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (since T is not allowed at 1, and H and O are already placed, and we avoid forbidden letters).
  Position 3: either T or one of the available letters (but if it's not T, then T must be at position 4).
  Position 4: similarly.

But note: we have to use only available letters and include T.

Also, we have to avoid the forbidden letters.

Let's list the available letters for position 1: 
  We cannot use: A, C, E, G, I, L, N, P, R, S, U, and also T is not allowed at position 1, and O and H are fixed at 2 and 5.
  So available: B, D, F, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For positions 3 and 4: 
  We must have T in one of them, and the other must be from the available letters (same set, but note that H and O are already used, but they can be repeated? The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates, but typically Wordle words can have duplicates? However, in this case, we don't have any indication of duplicates so far, and the word might be without duplicates.

But to be safe, we should consider that the word might have duplicates. However, since we have H and O already, and if we put H again? But we don't know. But in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback.

But let's assume the word has no duplicates for now, because we haven't encountered any. So we avoid using O and H again in positions 1,3,4.

So, for positions 1,3,4: we must use three distinct letters from: B, D, F, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. And one of positions 3 or 4 must be T.

So, the word is: [1] O [3] [4] H, with [3] and [4] being two distinct letters from the available set, and one of them is T.

Now, we need to make a guess that fits this pattern and uses the available letters.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Possible words:

We need to fill:
  Position 1: one letter from B, D, F, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
  Position 3: either T or a new letter (but if not T, then position 4 must be T).
  Position 4: similarly.

But we don't know which of 3 or 4 is T. So we have two cases.

We can try to pick a word that has T in position 3 and a new letter in 1 and 4, or T in position 4 and new letters in 1 and 3.

We should choose a word that is common and uses common letters.

Let's try to find words that end with ""O?H"" but with the pattern: _ O _ _ H

For example, if T is in position 3: then the pattern is _ O T _ H. What words? 
  Position 1: must be a consonant (since it's the start) and from the available set.
  Position 4: must be a letter from available set (without T, O, H, and the letter at position1).

Possible: 
  ""M O T T H"" -> but T repeated? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, T would be at 3 and 4? But we need distinct? And also, we have two T's? But the feedback from ""tough"" had T only once? Actually, the feedback for ""tough"" had T marked as present but wrong position, but it didn't say how many. So there could be two T's? But we don't know.

But to be safe, let's avoid duplicates for now.

So, if T is at position 3: then position 4 must be a different letter.

Words: 
  ""M O T H ?"" -> but we have H at the end? The pattern is _ O T _ H -> so the last is H, so it's ""O T ? H"" but that's positions 2,3,4,5: so the word is [1] O T [4] H.

What are some words? 
  ""M O T H H"" -> duplicate H? Not allowed? And not a word.
  ""B O T H H"" -> same.
  ""D O T C H"" -> C is forbidden.
  ""F O T H"" -> not 5 letters? We need 5: F O T ? H -> so F O T X H? ""fotxh"" is not a word.

Common words: 
  ""w o t h"" -> not 5 letters? We need 5.

Actually, I can't think of a common word with the pattern _ O T _ H.

Now, if T is at position 4: then the pattern is _ O _ T H.

Words: 
  ""C O M T H"" -> C forbidden.
  ""D O U T H"" -> U is forbidden (from guess3: U(x)).
  ""F O O T H"" -> duplicate O? And O is already at position2, so if we put O at position3, then we have two O's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, ""footh"" is not a word.
  ""M O O T H"" -> again, duplicate O and not a common word? ""moot"" is 4 letters.
  ""B O O T H"" -> duplicate O, and ""booth"" is a word. But we have O at position2 and then O at position3? That would be two O's.

But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. The feedback so far hasn't indicated duplicates, but it's possible.

In ""booth"", we have two O's and two H's? No: B-O-O-T-H -> two O's and one H? But we have H at position5, so if we put O at position3, that's two O's.

But we have to consider: if the word has two O's, then in the feedback for ""tough"", we had O at position2 correct, but we didn't have an O in any other position? In ""tough"", we only had one O at position2. So if the secret word has two O's, then when we guessed ""tough"", we would have gotten one O correct (position2) and the other O would have been marked as present if it was in the word? But in ""tough"", we didn't have a second O, so we wouldn't get feedback for the second O.

So it's possible that the word has two O's? But we don't have evidence.

Similarly, for H: we have H at position5 correct. If the word has another H, we don't know.

But to keep it simple, let's first assume no duplicates. Then, we cannot use O or H again in positions 1,3,4.

So, for the pattern _ O _ T H (if T is at 4): 
  Position 1: available letter (not O, H, T, and not forbidden)
  Position 3: available letter (not O, H, T, and not forbidden)

Similarly, for _ O T _ H: 
  Position 1: available letter
  Position 4: available letter

But we are struggling to find common words.

Let me list possible words that fit the pattern and use available letters.

Pattern: [1] O [3] [4] H

With [3] and [4] being two distinct letters from the available set, and one of them is T.

Available letters for 1,3,4: B, D, F, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. (and we must use T in either 3 or 4)

Case 1: T at position 3 -> pattern: [1] O T [4] H
  We need a word: [1]OT[4]H
  [1] must be consonant, [4] must be vowel or consonant? But it's the fourth letter.

Possible words:
  ""M O T H H"" -> invalid, duplicate H and not a word.
  ""B O T H"" -> too short? We need 5 letters: B O T ? H -> so 5th is H, so it's B O T [4] H -> 5 letters. What can [4] be?
    With available letters: B, D, F, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. But T is at 3, so [4] cannot be T? And we avoid duplicates? So [4] is one of D, F, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  But what words? 
    ""B O T C H"" -> C forbidden.
    ""B O T H H"" -> invalid.
    ""M O T H"" -> too short.

  I can't think of a common word. 

  ""Y O T H"" -> too short.

  ""J O T H"" -> not a word? Jot is 3 letters.

  This pattern might not yield common words.

Case 2: T at position 4 -> pattern: [1] O [3] T H
  We need a word: [1]O[3]TH

  [1] and [3] from available letters (without T, O, H) and distinct.

  Available: B, D, F, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  What words?
    ""B O M T H"" -> M is available, ""bomth"" is not a word.
    ""D O M T H"" -> ""domth"" not a word.
    ""F O M T H"" -> no.
    ""J O K T H"" -> ""jokth"" not a word.
    ""M O T T H"" -> duplicate T? And ""motth"" not a word.
    ""W O M T H"" -> no.

  But there is ""month"", but N is forbidden (from guess1: N(x)).

  ""both"" is 4 letters.

  ""doth"": D O T H -> 4 letters.

  ""moth"": M O T H -> 4 letters.

  How about 5 letters? 

  ""booth"": B O O T H -> but this has two O's. And O is at position2 and position3? So duplicate O.

  ""booty"": but ends with Y, not H.

  ""sooth"": but S is forbidden.

  ""tooth"": T O O T H -> T at position1? But we know T is not at position1 (from feedback of ""tough"": T(-) at position1). Also, S is not in it? But ""tooth"" has T at 1 and 2? But we have O at position2, so if we put T at1, it's not allowed because T is not at1. Also, ""tooth"" has two O's and two T's.

  But let's consider duplicates: if we allow duplicates, then ""booth"" is a word: B O O T H -> positions: B(1), O(2), O(3), T(4), H(5). 

  Now, check against feedback:
    We know O is at position2: yes, in ""booth"", position2 is O -> correct.
    H is at position5: yes.
    T is in the word: in ""booth"", T is at position4 -> so it should be marked as present? But in the pattern, we have T at position4, which is not the same as the previous T position? Previously T was at position1 in ""tough"" and it was wrong, and at position5 in ""split"" and it was wrong. Now at position4.

  Also, we have two O's: but in ""tough"", we only guessed one O (at position2) and it was correct. We didn't guess the other O, so that's fine.

  But we also have to check the forbidden letters: ""booth"" has B, O, O, T, H. 
    B: not forbidden? 
    O: already known
    T: known
    H: known

  Forbidden letters: not in the list.

  So ""booth"" is a candidate.

  Another candidate: ""moody"" -> but doesn't end with H.

  ""goodh"" -> not a word.

  ""goth"" is 4 letters.

  Another word: ""bothy"" -> B O T H Y -> but that's 5 letters: B(1), O(2), T(3), H(4), Y(5). But we need H at position5, not at position4. In ""bothy"", H is at position4, but we need it at position5. So not matching.

  ""dowth"" -> not a word.

  ""fouth"" -> F O U T H -> but U is forbidden (from guess3: U(x)).

  ""youth"" -> Y O U T H -> U is forbidden? Yes, U(x) in guess3. So we cannot use U.

  So ""booth"" is a possibility.

  Another word: ""vouch"" -> V O U C H -> U and C forbidden.

  ""jotun"" -> not ending with H.

  ""booth"" seems to be a valid word that fits the pattern if we allow duplicate O.

  But we have to consider: in the feedback for ""tough"", we had O at position2 correct, and we didn't get any indication of a second O. That's fine because we didn't guess it.

  Also, T is at position4, which is new.

  But we also have to check if B is allowed? B is not in the forbidden list.

  So ""booth"" is a candidate.

  Are there other words? 

  ""mooty"" -> not ending with H.

  ""footy"" -> not ending with H.

  ""sooty"" -> S forbidden.

  ""boots"" -> ends with S, not H.

  ""booth"" is the only common word I can think of.

  But what about ""dhoti""? D H O T I -> but pattern: D(1), H(2)? But we need O at position2. So not.

  Another: ""johns"" -> not.

  So perhaps ""booth"" is a good guess.

  But we have to confirm: the pattern is [1] O [3] [4] H. In ""booth"": 
    Position1: B
    Position2: O (correct)
    Position3: O (duplicate)
    Position4: T
    Position5: H (correct)

  This matches.

  But we have two O's. Is that allowed? The game allows duplicate letters.

  Also, we haven't used B before, so it's new.

  But we are not sure if T is at position4. It could be at position3.

  However, we don't have a good word for T at position3.

  Another possibility: T at position3 and then position4 is a letter that can form a word.

  For example, ""mothy"": but we have M O T H Y -> but H is at position4? We need H at position5. So ""mothy"" is M(1) O(2) T(3) H(4) Y(5) -> but then position5 is Y, not H. And we need position5 to be H.

  ""moth"" is 4 letters.

  ""bothy"": B O T H Y -> B(1) O(2) T(3) H(4) Y(5) -> but then position4 is H, but we need position5 to be H. So not.

  ""tophi"": T O P H I -> P and I forbidden.

  So no common word for T at position3.

  Therefore, the only common word we have is ""booth"".

  But let's check if there is a word with T at position4 and no duplicate.

  For example, ""dowth"" is not a word.

  ""howth"" not a word.

  ""jowth"" not a word.

  ""kowth"" not a word.

  ""mowth"" not a word.

  ""nowth"" not a word.

  ""rowth"" not a word.

  ""vowth"" not a word.

  ""wowth"" not a word.

  ""yowth"" not a word.

  ""zowth"" not a word.

  So, it seems ""booth"" is the best candidate.

  But we have to consider: what if the word has no duplicate? Then we must find a word without duplicate O.

  In that case, we might need to try a different approach.

  Another idea: the word could be ""fouth"" but U is forbidden.

  Or ""youth"" but U forbidden.

  So no.

  What about ""doth"" with an extra letter? No.

  Perhaps we missed a word.

  Let me think: words ending with ""th"": 
    ""berth"" -> but E and R forbidden.
    ""birth"" -> I forbidden? I is in the forbidden list (from guess2: I(x)).
    ""girth"" -> G and I forbidden.
    ""mirth"" -> M, I, R -> R forbidden.
    ""worth"" -> W, O, R, T, H -> but R forbidden.
    ""firth"" -> F, I, R -> I and R forbidden.
    ""kith"" -> too short.
    ""pith"" -> P and I forbidden.

  All have forbidden letters.

  So, the only possibility is ""booth"" with duplicate O.

  Therefore, I will guess ""booth"".

  But note: in ""booth"", we have O at position3 as well. We don't know if that is allowed, but it's a valid word.

  So, next guess: ""booth""

  But let's see the feedback we might get.

  If the secret word is ""booth"", then we get it right.

  If not, we get feedback that might help.

  Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests more letters, but we are constrained by the fixed O and H.

  We have to include T and the pattern.

  Another word: ""mothy"" doesn't fit because of the H position.

  ""tophi"" is invalid.

  So, I think ""booth"" is the best guess.

  But wait, we have not used M, for example. We could try ""moth"" but it's 4 letters.

  Or ""month"" is invalid.

  So, I'll go with ""booth"".

<guess>booth</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2 (split)**: S, P, L, I are not in the word, but T is present (wrong position, so not at position 5).
- **Guess 3 (tough)**:
  - T is present but not at position 1 (and not at 5, from guess 2).
  - O is correct and in position 2.
  - U is not in the word.
  - G is not in the word.
  - H is correct and in position 5.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ O _ _ H`.
- T must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1 or 5, so it must be in position 3 or 4.
- Excluded letters: A, C, E, G, I, L, N, P, R, S, U.
- Available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but H and O are already placed, so they cannot be reused in other positions unless duplicates are allowed).
- Given the constraints, the only common English word fitting the pattern `_ O _ _ H` with T in position 4 (and allowing a duplicate O) is **""booth""**:
  - B (position 1, new letter),
  - O (position 2, correct and fixed),
  - O (position 3, duplicate O),
  - T (position 4, T placed here for testing),
  - H (position 5, correct and fixed).

This guess tests the possibility of T in position 4 and checks for duplicate O, while using valid letters.",Guess 4: booth -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) O(✓) O(✓) T(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
