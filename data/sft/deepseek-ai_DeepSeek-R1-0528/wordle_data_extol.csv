We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get. 
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.

 Common starting words in Wordle include: CRANE, SLATE, TRACE, etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is: CRANE

We are given the first guess: ""crane"" and the feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
 This means:
   - C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.
   - E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 Since E is in the word but not in the last position (since we placed it at the end and got a '-'), it must be in one of the first four positions.

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 We have to make a second guess. We must choose a 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, R, A, N (because they are not in the word).
   - Contains the letter E, but not in the fifth position (since that was wrong). However, we don't know the correct position of E, so we can try it in a different position.

 We also want to maximize information by using new common letters and avoiding the excluded ones.

 Let's think of common letters that are left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since E is present, we should include E in a different position.

 Possible positions for E: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

 We also know that the word must have E and four other letters from the remaining set (excluding C, R, A, N).

 Let's try to form a word that has E in a different position and uses other common letters.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, O, L, I, etc.

 Example words: 
   - We could try E in the first position: e.g., ""EIGHT"" -> but E is in position 1, and we have G, H, I, T. However, we don't know if these are present.
   - But note: we have to avoid C, R, A, N.

 Another idea: since we have only one known letter (E) and we know it's not at the end, we can try to put E in the middle and use other common consonants.

 Let's try to pick a word that has E and also includes other vowels? But we know A is not present, so the other vowel might be I, O, U.

 However, we don't have any information about other vowels.

 We can try: ""SPIEL"" but that has 5 letters? Actually, ""spiel"" is 5 letters: S-P-I-E-L.

 But let's check: 
   S, P, I, E, L -> none of these are in the excluded set (C, R, A, N). And E is in the 4th position? Actually, in ""spiel"", the E is the 4th letter? 
   S(1), P(2), I(3), E(4), L(5). But we know E cannot be in the 5th position? Actually, in the first guess, E was in the 5th and got '-', meaning it's present but not in the 5th. So in this word, E is in the 4th, which is allowed.

 However, we don't know if the secret word has E in the 4th or not. We are just trying to test.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the first position to see if it fits there.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more new letters.

 Let's think of a word that has E and also includes other common letters that we haven't tried, such as S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 Another common word: ""TOILE"" -> but that might not be common. Let's think of more common words.

 How about ""SLATE""? But we know A is not in the word (from first feedback: A(x)), so we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A.

 How about ""STOLE""? 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E is at the end? But we cannot put E at the end because we know that position is wrong. So we need to avoid the 5th position for E.

 Therefore, we can rearrange: how about ""STOLE"" but we can't because E is at the end. 

 We can try ""MODEL"": 
   M, O, D, E, L -> E is in the 4th position? 
   But note: the word ""model"" has E in the 4th? M(1), O(2), D(3), E(4), L(5). So E is in the 4th and L at the end. This is acceptable because we are not putting E at the end.

 However, we are not sure if E is in the 4th or not. We are just trying to cover.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the first position: e.g., ""ELVIS"" -> E, L, V, I, S. But V and I are less common.

 Another idea: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end, which we must avoid.

 We need a word without E at the end and without C, R, A, N.

 Let's try ""PILED"": 
   P, I, L, E, D -> E is in the 4th position? P(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). This is acceptable.

 But we don't know if D is in the word.

 Another common word: ""TIMES"" -> T, I, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th? T(1), I(2), M(3), E(4), S(5). This is acceptable.

 However, we are not sure about the letters. We want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let's list the letters we have not tried: 
   Excluded: C, R, A, N
   Tried: C, R, A, N, E (but E is in the word, so we know we must use it again)

 We have 21 letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E is known to be present).

 We can try to use a word that has E and four of these.

 I think ""TIMES"" is a good candidate: it has T, I, M, E, S. All common.

 But note: we are not forced to put E in the 4th position. We can try it in the first, second, or third as well.

 Alternatively, we can try ""BELOW"": 
   B, E, L, O, W -> E in the second position. This is acceptable and we avoid the 5th for E.

 However, we don't know if B, L, O, W are in the word.

 Another common word: ""FIELD"" -> F, I, E, L, D -> E in the third position.

 But let's choose a word that has E in a position we haven't tested. In the first guess, E was in the 5th. Now we can try it in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.

 Since we have no information about the first four positions, we can try to put E in the first position to see if it is correct there.

 Example: ""EIGHT"" -> E, I, G, H, T. But we don't know about these letters.

 However, we want to maximize the number of new letters. ""EIGHT"" uses E, I, G, H, T. That's five new letters (except E, which we know is present).

 But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters (C, R, A, N) and we are.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SPEED"" but that has duplicate E? We don't know if there are duplicate E's. But the feedback for the first guess only showed one E? Actually, the feedback only marked the E at the end. If there were another E, it would have been marked? But in the first guess, we only had one E. So we don't know if there are multiple E's.

 However, to avoid duplicates and to cover more letters, we should prefer a word with distinct letters.

 So ""EIGHT"" has distinct letters: E, I, G, H, T.

 But is ""eight"" a valid word? Yes.

 However, we can also consider ""ETHOS"": E, T, H, O, S -> distinct and common.

 Let me compare:
   ""EIGHT"": E in position 1, which we haven't tested. And we get to test I, G, H, T.
   ""ETHOS"": E in position 1, and then T, H, O, S.

 Both are good.

 But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have E in the first position? We don't know. So testing E in the first is a good idea.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in the second position to see if it belongs there.

 How about ""LEMON"": but we have to avoid A? Actually, L, E, M, O, N -> but N is excluded! We cannot use N because we know it's not in the word.

 So we must avoid N.

 Therefore, ""LEMON"" is invalid because of N.

 How about ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E in second. This is acceptable.

 But we don't know about B, L, O, W.

 Another word: ""DEVIL"" -> D, E, V, I, L -> E in second. But V is less common.

 I think ""ETHOS"" is a good choice because it has E in the first and then common letters T, H, O, S.

 Let's go with ""ETHOS"".

 So the second guess: ETHOS

 We'll see if E is in the first position (if it is, we get a check) and we get information about T, H, O, S.

 But note: we are not forced to use E in the first. We are just testing.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has E in a position that we haven't tested and also includes other common letters.

 Since we only know E is present and not in the 5th, we can try to put E in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th. We tried 5th and it was wrong. We haven't tried 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th.

 We can try 1st in this guess.

 So, I choose ""ETHOS"".

<guess>ethos</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, N not in the word; E present but not in the 5th position), the second guess must:
- Exclude C, R, A, N
- Include E, but not in the 5th position
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, L, I) to maximize information

The word ""ethos"" is chosen because:
- It places E in the 1st position (a new untested position)
- Uses new common letters: T, H, O, S
- Avoids repeated letters and excluded letters
- Tests if E is correctly placed at the start

   - Does not contain C, R, A, N (because they are not in the word).
   - Contains the letter E, but not in the fifth position (since that was wrong). However, we don't know the correct position of E, so we can try it in a different position.

 We also want to maximize information by using new common letters and avoiding the excluded ones.

 Let's think of common letters that are left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since E is present, we should include E in a different position.

 Possible positions for E: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

 We also know that the word must have E and four other letters from the remaining set (excluding C, R, A, N).

 Let's try to form a word that has E in a different position and uses other common letters.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, O, L, I, etc.

 Example words: 
   - We could try E in the first position: e.g., ""EIGHT"" -> but E is in position 1, and we have G, H, I, T. However, we don't know if these are present.
   - But note: we have to avoid C, R, A, N.

 Another idea: since we have only one known letter (E) and we know it's not at the end, we can try to put E in the middle and use other common consonants.

 Let's try to pick a word that has E and also includes other vowels? But we know A is not present, so the other vowel might be I, O, U.

 However, we don't have any information about other vowels.

 We can try: ""SPIEL"" but that has 5 letters? Actually, ""spiel"" is 5 letters: S-P-I-E-L.

 But let's check: 
   S, P, I, E, L -> none of these are in the excluded set (C, R, A, N). And E is in the 4th position? Actually, in ""spiel"", the E is the 4th letter? 
   S(1), P(2), I(3), E(4), L(5). But we know E cannot be in the 5th position? Actually, in the first guess, E was in the 5th and got '-', meaning it's present but not in the 5th. So in this word, E is in the 4th, which is allowed.

 However, we don't know if the secret word has E in the 4th or not. We are just trying to test.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the first position to see if it fits there.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more new letters.

 Let's think of a word that has E and also includes other common letters that we haven't tried, such as S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 Another common word: ""TOILE"" -> but that might not be common. Let's think of more common words.

 How about ""SLATE""? But we know A is not in the word (from first feedback: A(x)), so we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A.

 How about ""STOLE""? 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E is at the end? But we cannot put E at the end because we know that position is wrong. So we need to avoid the 5th position for E.

 Therefore, we can rearrange: how about ""STOLE"" but we can't because E is at the end. 

 We can try ""MODEL"": 
   M, O, D, E, L -> E is in the 4th position? 
   But note: the word ""model"" has E in the 4th? M(1), O(2), D(3), E(4), L(5). So E is in the 4th and L at the end. This is acceptable because we are not putting E at the end.

 However, we are not sure if E is in the 4th or not. We are just trying to cover.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the first position: e.g., ""ELVIS"" -> E, L, V, I, S. But V and I are less common.

 Another idea: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end, which we must avoid.

 We need a word without E at the end and without C, R, A, N.

 Let's try ""PILED"": 
   P, I, L, E, D -> E is in the 4th position? P(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). This is acceptable.

 But we don't know if D is in the word.

 Another common word: ""TIMES"" -> T, I, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th? T(1), I(2), M(3), E(4), S(5). This is acceptable.

 However, we are not sure about the letters. We want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let's list the letters we have not tried: 
   Excluded: C, R, A, N
   Tried: C, R, A, N, E (but E is in the word, so we know we must use it again)

 We have 21 letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E is known to be present).

 We can try to use a word that has E and four of these.

 I think ""TIMES"" is a good candidate: it has T, I, M, E, S. All common.

 But note: we are not forced to put E in the 4th position. We can try it in the first, second, or third as well.

 Alternatively, we can try ""BELOW"": 
   B, E, L, O, W -> E in the second position. This is acceptable and we avoid the 5th for E.

 However, we don't know if B, L, O, W are in the word.

 Another common word: ""FIELD"" -> F, I, E, L, D -> E in the third position.

 But let's choose a word that has E in a position we haven't tested. In the first guess, E was in the 5th. Now we can try it in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.

 Since we have no information about the first four positions, we can try to put E in the first position to see if it is correct there.

 Example: ""EIGHT"" -> E, I, G, H, T. But we don't know about these letters.

 However, we want to maximize the number of new letters. ""EIGHT"" uses E, I, G, H, T. That's five new letters (except E, which we know is present).

 But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters (C, R, A, N) and we are.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SPEED"" but that has duplicate E? We don't know if there are duplicate E's. But the feedback for the first guess only showed one E? Actually, the feedback only marked the E at the end. If there were another E, it would have been marked? But in the first guess, we only had one E. So we don't know if there are multiple E's.

 However, to avoid duplicates and to cover more letters, we should prefer a word with distinct letters.

 So ""EIGHT"" has distinct letters: E, I, G, H, T.

 But is ""eight"" a valid word? Yes.

 However, we can also consider ""ETHOS"": E, T, H, O, S -> distinct and common.

 Let me compare:
   ""EIGHT"": E in position 1, which we haven't tested. And we get to test I, G, H, T.
   ""ETHOS"": E in position 1, and then T, H, O, S.

 Both are good.

 But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have E in the first position? We don't know. So testing E in the first is a good idea.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in the second position to see if it belongs there.

 How about ""LEMON"": but we have to avoid A? Actually, L, E, M, O, N -> but N is excluded! We cannot use N because we know it's not in the word.

 So we must avoid N.

 Therefore, ""LEMON"" is invalid because of N.

 How about ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E in second. This is acceptable.

 But we don't know about B, L, O, W.

 Another word: ""DEVIL"" -> D, E, V, I, L -> E in second. But V is less common.

 I think ""ETHOS"" is a good choice because it has E in the first and then common letters T, H, O, S.

 Let's go with ""ETHOS"".

 So the second guess: ETHOS

 We'll see if E is in the first position (if it is, we get a check) and we get information about T, H, O, S.

 But note: we are not forced to use E in the first. We are just testing.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has E in a position that we haven't tested and also includes other common letters.

 Since we only know E is present and not in the 5th, we can try to put E in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th. We tried 5th and it was wrong. We haven't tried 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th.

 We can try 1st in this guess.

 So, I choose ""ETHOS"".

<guess>ethos</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, N not in the word; E present but not in the 5th position), the second guess must:
- Exclude C, R, A, N
- Include E, but not in the 5th position
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, L, I) to maximize information

The word ""ethos"" is chosen because:
- It places E in the 1st position (a new untested position)
- Uses new common letters: T, H, O, S
- Avoids repeated letters and excluded letters
- Tests if E is correctly placed at the start

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
  - C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.
  - E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""ethos"" -> E(✓), T(-), H(x), O(✓), S(x)
Meaning:
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
  - T is in the word but not in position 2 (since it got a minus).
  - H is not in the word.
  - O is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
  - S is not in the word.

So, from both guesses, we know:

Correct letters in correct positions:
  Position 1: E
  Position 4: O

Letters that are in the word but in the wrong position:
  T (but not in position 2)

Letters that are not in the word:
  C, R, A, N, H, S

Also, we know that E is in position 1 and O in position 4.

The word so far: E _ _ O _

We also know that T is in the word, but not in position 2. So T must be in position 3 or 5.

But note: position 5 is the last letter, and we don't know what it is yet.

We also have to account for the fact that we have one more known letter: T (somewhere in positions 3 or 5).

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, H, O, S (and E and O are confirmed, T is confirmed but misplaced).

We need to find a word that:
  - Starts with E
  - Has O in the 4th position
  - Contains T (but not in the 2nd position, so in 3rd or 5th)
  - Does not contain: C, R, A, N, H, S

We have two positions to fill: position 2, 3, and 5 (but note that T will take one of 3 or 5, and the other two positions are unknown).

Actually, the word is: E _ _ O _
We know position 1: E, position 4: O.
We need to assign:
  Position 2: a letter that we haven't used and is not excluded.
  Position 3: either T or a new letter? But we know T must be in the word, so if T is not in position 3, then it must be in position 5. And position 3 would be a new letter.

So the word can be either:
  Option 1: E _ T O _   (with T in position 3, and then position 2 and 5 are two new letters, and position 5 cannot be T because then T would be in two positions? But we don't know if T is repeated. However, the feedback for ""ethos"" showed T as present but not in position 2, but it didn't say anything about duplicates. So we cannot assume only one T. But typically, we assume no duplicates until we see evidence. However, we must consider the possibility.

But note: in the first guess, we had only one E and it was marked as present. In the second guess, we have one T and it was marked as present. So it's possible that there is only one T.

But to be safe, we should consider that T might be in one of the positions: 3 or 5.

We also have to fill position 2 and the remaining position (if T is in 3, then position 5 is left; if T is in 5, then position 3 is left).

So the possibilities:

Case 1: T is in position 3 -> word: E _ T O _
  Then we need two more letters: one for position 2 and one for position 5.

Case 2: T is in position 5 -> word: E _ _ O T
  Then we need two more letters: one for position 2 and one for position 3.

We also have the constraint that the word must not contain: C, R, A, N, H, S.

We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only the remaining letters.

What letters are left? We have used: C, R, A, N, E, T, H, O, S. But E, T, O are in the word (or must be, T is in the word). The excluded letters are: C, R, A, N, H, S.

The available letters: 
  All letters except: C, R, A, N, H, S, and also excluding E, T, O? But we can use other letters that haven't been tried? Actually, we can use any letter not excluded, but we know E, T, O are in the word (so we must use them, but we already have E and O placed, and T must appear once).

So for the remaining positions, we can use any letter from the 26 alphabet minus the excluded ones: C, R, A, N, H, S.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid English word.

We also have to consider that in the second guess, we had T in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So T cannot be in position 2, which we already accounted for.

Now, for the third guess, we want to test the possibilities and also get more information.

We can try to form a word that fits one of the patterns and tests common letters.

But note: we have two cases. We can try to design a guess that helps us distinguish between the two cases and also tests common letters.

Alternatively, we can try to cover as many common letters as possible in the available positions.

Let me think of common words that start with E and have O in the fourth position.

Pattern: E _ _ O _

We know T must be in the word, so we can try to put T in position 3 or 5 to test.

But we don't know which one. So we can make a guess that covers one of the cases and tests other letters.

For example, if we assume T is in position 3, then we can try:

Word: E X T O Y, where X and Y are new letters.

But we don't know if that's the case.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has T in position 5 to test that case.

But we have to choose one.

We can also try a word that doesn't commit to one case but tests multiple possibilities? But we have to put letters in the positions.

Another idea: we can use a word that has T in position 5, and then in position 2 and 3 we put two common letters that we haven't tried. That way, if we get feedback that T is in the word and in the correct position (if we put it in 5) then we know. Otherwise, if T is not in 5, then it must be in 3.

But note: we already know T is in the word, so if we put T in position 5 and it is correct, we get a check. If it is not, then we know T must be in position 3.

So we can design a guess that tests position 5 for T and also tests two new letters in positions 2 and 3.

Let me try:

Guess: E _ _ O T

We need to fill positions 2 and 3 with two letters from the available set.

We want to choose common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

For example, let's try E L I O T -> ""ELIOT"" (which is a name, but is it a valid word? In Wordle, proper nouns are not allowed? Actually, Wordle uses common words, and ""eliot"" might not be accepted. We need a common word.)

Another word: E X O T? But we need 5 letters: E _ _ O T.

How about ""ERGOT""? But R is excluded.

We cannot use R.

How about ""EGGOT""? Not a word.

""EBTOT""? Not a word.

Let me think of words ending with T and having E at the start and O in the fourth.

""EDGOT""? No.

""EXOT""? No, that's 4 letters.

""EXPOT""? Not a word.

""DEMOT""? Not a word.

This is hard.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has T in position 3: E _ T O _

For example: ""METRO"" -> but R is excluded and O is already in position 4? ""METRO"": M E T R O -> positions: M(1), E(2) -> but we need E at position 1. So no.

We need E at position 1 and O at position 4.

So pattern: E X T O Y

For example: ""ENTER"" -> E N T E R -> but N is excluded and we have two E's? Also, positions: E(1), N(2) -> but we need O at position 4, not R at 4. So no.

Another: ""E T O L E""? Not 5 letters.

""P E T O S"" -> but not starting with E.

We need to start with E.

Let me search for words: E _ _ O _

Common words: 
  ""ELBOW"": E L B O W -> but O is at position 4? E(1), L(2), B(3), O(4), W(5). This fits. And we don't have any excluded letters? L, B, W are not excluded (excluded: C,R,A,N,H,S). So this is possible.

But note: we know T is in the word. If we guess ""ELBOW"", we are not including T. But we know T must be in the word. So if we guess ""ELBOW"", and if the word does not have T, then we get feedback that T is missing? But we know T is present, so if we don't include T, we will get a feedback that T is not in the word? But that would be a contradiction because we know T is present. Therefore, we must include T in our guess.

So we cannot guess a word that does not include T.

Therefore, we must have T in the word.

So for the third guess, we must include T and place it in either position 3 or 5.

So let's try to form a word with T in position 5: E _ _ O T

We need two letters for positions 2 and 3 from the available set: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

What words are there?

Examples:
  ""EDIT"": too short.
  ""EDUCT"": but D and U? E(1), D(2), U(3), C(4) -> but we need O at 4, not C. And C is excluded.

  ""E V O L T""? Not a word.

  ""E M O T E""? But that would be E M O T E -> positions: E(1), M(2), O(3) -> but we need O at 4, so no.

  ""E L O P T"": not 5 letters.

  ""EXPORT"": but R and P? E(1), X(2), P(3), O(4), R(5) -> but R is excluded.

  ""E V O T E""? Not a word.

  ""E V O I T""? Not a word.

  ""E V O L T"" is not a word.

  ""E F O U T""? Not a word.

  ""E C O S T"" -> but C and S are excluded.

This is difficult. Maybe T in position 5 is not common.

Now, try T in position 3: E _ T O _

We need position 2 and 5.

Words: E X T O Y

For example:
  ""ENTER"": E N T E R -> but N and R excluded, and also O not at 4? It's E N T E R -> positions: 1:E, 2:N, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> but we need O at 4, so no.

  ""ELTON"": E L T O N -> but N is excluded.

  ""METRO"": M E T R O -> but M(1), E(2) -> not starting with E.

  ""PETOS"": P E T O S -> not starting with E.

  ""DETOX"": D E T O X -> D(1), E(2) -> not starting with E.

  ""BETON"": B E T O N -> B(1), E(2) -> not starting with E.

  ""EXTOL"": E X T O L -> E(1), X(2), T(3), O(4), L(5). This fits the pattern. And letters: X, T, O, L. T and O are already known, and X and L are new. Also, X and L are not excluded.

  Is ""EXTOL"" a word? Yes, meaning: to praise highly.

  And it has T in position 3, which is one of the possibilities.

  Also, it includes L, which is a common letter.

  But note: we are not sure if T is in position 3 or 5. By guessing ""EXTOL"", we are assuming T is in position 3. If it is not, then we will get feedback that T is not in the word? But we know T is in the word, so if it's not in position 3, then it must be in position 5. And in that case, the feedback for T in position 3 will be a minus (since it's present but wrong position) and we will know that T is in position 5.

  Also, we get feedback on X and L.

  So this guess can help us.

  Another word: ""ECTOR""? Not a word.

  ""ENTOM""? Not a word.

  ""EXTO"" something.

  ""EXTOL"" seems good.

  But let's see if there is a word with T in position 5 that we can use.

  For example: ""E L O T S""? Not a word.

  ""E M O T E"" is 5 letters but O is at 3, not 4.

  ""E P O T S""? Not a word.

  ""E C O T Y""? No.

  ""E V O T E""? Not a word.

  ""E V O L T"" is not a word.

  ""E V O T E"" is not a word.

  ""E Y O T S""? Not a word.

  ""E Y O T H""? Not a word.

  ""E D O T S""? Not a word.

  ""E D O T H""? Not a word.

  ""E D O M T""? Not a word.

  ""E D O P T"" -> ""EDOPT"" is not a word. But ""ADOPT"" is, but we don't start with A.

  ""DEPOT"": D E P O T -> D(1), E(2) -> not starting with E.

  So it seems hard to find a word with T at the end and O at 4.

  Therefore, we go with ""EXTOL"".

  So guess: EXTOL

  This will test:
    E: should be correct (position 1) -> we expect a check.
    X: new letter, position 2.
    T: in position 3 -> if it is correct, we get a check; if not, we get a minus (because T is in the word) and then we know T must be in position 5.
    O: should be correct (position 4) -> we expect a check.
    L: new letter, position 5.

  And we avoid excluded letters.

  So let's go with that.

<guess>extol</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C, R, A, N are not in the word. E is present but not in position 5.
- **Guess 2: ""ethos""** → E is correct and in position 1. T is present but not in position 2. O is correct and in position 4. H and S are not in the word.

### Key Insights:
- **Known correct positions**: 
  - Position 1: E
  - Position 4: O
- **Known present letter (wrong position)**: 
  - T (must be in position 3 or 5, since position 2 was incorrect).
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, H, S (not in the word at all).
- **Word structure**: E _ _ O _

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- We must include T (since it's confirmed present) and test its position (3 or 5).
- Use new, common letters from the remaining pool (B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) for other positions.
- Prioritize a word that:
  - Fits the pattern E _ _ O _.
  - Places T in position 3 (to test if it's correct there).
  - Uses high-frequency unused letters (e.g., L, X) to maximize information.

Chose **""EXTOL""** because:
- E (position 1) and O (position 4) are already confirmed, so they will validate the pattern.
- T is placed in position 3 to test if it belongs there.
- X (position 2) and L (position 5) are new, common letters not yet tested.
- Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, A, N, H, S).

This guess will:
- Confirm if T is in position 3 (if correct, we solve position 3; if not, T must be in position 5).
- Provide feedback on X and L, narrowing down possibilities for remaining positions.

<guess>extol</guess>",extol,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
  - C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.
  - E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""ethos"" -> E(✓), T(-), H(x), O(✓), S(x)
Meaning:
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
  - T is in the word but not in position 2 (since it got a minus).
  - H is not in the word.
  - O is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
  - S is not in the word.

So, from both guesses, we know:

Correct letters in correct positions:
  Position 1: E
  Position 4: O

Letters that are in the word but in the wrong position:
  T (but not in position 2)

Letters that are not in the word:
  C, R, A, N, H, S

Also, we know that E is in position 1 and O in position 4.

The word so far: E _ _ O _

We also know that T is in the word, but not in position 2. So T must be in position 3 or 5.

But note: position 5 is the last letter, and we don't know what it is yet.

We also have to account for the fact that we have one more known letter: T (somewhere in positions 3 or 5).

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, H, O, S (and E and O are confirmed, T is confirmed but misplaced).

We need to find a word that:
  - Starts with E
  - Has O in the 4th position
  - Contains T (but not in the 2nd position, so in 3rd or 5th)
  - Does not contain: C, R, A, N, H, S

We have two positions to fill: position 2, 3, and 5 (but note that T will take one of 3 or 5, and the other two positions are unknown).

Actually, the word is: E _ _ O _
We know position 1: E, position 4: O.
We need to assign:
  Position 2: a letter that we haven't used and is not excluded.
  Position 3: either T or a new letter? But we know T must be in the word, so if T is not in position 3, then it must be in position 5. And position 3 would be a new letter.

So the word can be either:
  Option 1: E _ T O _   (with T in position 3, and then position 2 and 5 are two new letters, and position 5 cannot be T because then T would be in two positions? But we don't know if T is repeated. However, the feedback for ""ethos"" showed T as present but not in position 2, but it didn't say anything about duplicates. So we cannot assume only one T. But typically, we assume no duplicates until we see evidence. However, we must consider the possibility.

But note: in the first guess, we had only one E and it was marked as present. In the second guess, we have one T and it was marked as present. So it's possible that there is only one T.

But to be safe, we should consider that T might be in one of the positions: 3 or 5.

We also have to fill position 2 and the remaining position (if T is in 3, then position 5 is left; if T is in 5, then position 3 is left).

So the possibilities:

Case 1: T is in position 3 -> word: E _ T O _
  Then we need two more letters: one for position 2 and one for position 5.

Case 2: T is in position 5 -> word: E _ _ O T
  Then we need two more letters: one for position 2 and one for position 3.

We also have the constraint that the word must not contain: C, R, A, N, H, S.

We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only the remaining letters.

What letters are left? We have used: C, R, A, N, E, T, H, O, S. But E, T, O are in the word (or must be, T is in the word). The excluded letters are: C, R, A, N, H, S.

The available letters: 
  All letters except: C, R, A, N, H, S, and also excluding E, T, O? But we can use other letters that haven't been tried? Actually, we can use any letter not excluded, but we know E, T, O are in the word (so we must use them, but we already have E and O placed, and T must appear once).

So for the remaining positions, we can use any letter from the 26 alphabet minus the excluded ones: C, R, A, N, H, S.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid English word.

We also have to consider that in the second guess, we had T in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So T cannot be in position 2, which we already accounted for.

Now, for the third guess, we want to test the possibilities and also get more information.

We can try to form a word that fits one of the patterns and tests common letters.

But note: we have two cases. We can try to design a guess that helps us distinguish between the two cases and also tests common letters.

Alternatively, we can try to cover as many common letters as possible in the available positions.

Let me think of common words that start with E and have O in the fourth position.

Pattern: E _ _ O _

We know T must be in the word, so we can try to put T in position 3 or 5 to test.

But we don't know which one. So we can make a guess that covers one of the cases and tests other letters.

For example, if we assume T is in position 3, then we can try:

Word: E X T O Y, where X and Y are new letters.

But we don't know if that's the case.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has T in position 5 to test that case.

But we have to choose one.

We can also try a word that doesn't commit to one case but tests multiple possibilities? But we have to put letters in the positions.

Another idea: we can use a word that has T in position 5, and then in position 2 and 3 we put two common letters that we haven't tried. That way, if we get feedback that T is in the word and in the correct position (if we put it in 5) then we know. Otherwise, if T is not in 5, then it must be in 3.

But note: we already know T is in the word, so if we put T in position 5 and it is correct, we get a check. If it is not, then we know T must be in position 3.

So we can design a guess that tests position 5 for T and also tests two new letters in positions 2 and 3.

Let me try:

Guess: E _ _ O T

We need to fill positions 2 and 3 with two letters from the available set.

We want to choose common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

For example, let's try E L I O T -> ""ELIOT"" (which is a name, but is it a valid word? In Wordle, proper nouns are not allowed? Actually, Wordle uses common words, and ""eliot"" might not be accepted. We need a common word.)

Another word: E X O T? But we need 5 letters: E _ _ O T.

How about ""ERGOT""? But R is excluded.

We cannot use R.

How about ""EGGOT""? Not a word.

""EBTOT""? Not a word.

Let me think of words ending with T and having E at the start and O in the fourth.

""EDGOT""? No.

""EXOT""? No, that's 4 letters.

""EXPOT""? Not a word.

""DEMOT""? Not a word.

This is hard.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has T in position 3: E _ T O _

For example: ""METRO"" -> but R is excluded and O is already in position 4? ""METRO"": M E T R O -> positions: M(1), E(2) -> but we need E at position 1. So no.

We need E at position 1 and O at position 4.

So pattern: E X T O Y

For example: ""ENTER"" -> E N T E R -> but N is excluded and we have two E's? Also, positions: E(1), N(2) -> but we need O at position 4, not R at 4. So no.

Another: ""E T O L E""? Not 5 letters.

""P E T O S"" -> but not starting with E.

We need to start with E.

Let me search for words: E _ _ O _

Common words: 
  ""ELBOW"": E L B O W -> but O is at position 4? E(1), L(2), B(3), O(4), W(5). This fits. And we don't have any excluded letters? L, B, W are not excluded (excluded: C,R,A,N,H,S). So this is possible.

But note: we know T is in the word. If we guess ""ELBOW"", we are not including T. But we know T must be in the word. So if we guess ""ELBOW"", and if the word does not have T, then we get feedback that T is missing? But we know T is present, so if we don't include T, we will get a feedback that T is not in the word? But that would be a contradiction because we know T is present. Therefore, we must include T in our guess.

So we cannot guess a word that does not include T.

Therefore, we must have T in the word.

So for the third guess, we must include T and place it in either position 3 or 5.

So let's try to form a word with T in position 5: E _ _ O T

We need two letters for positions 2 and 3 from the available set: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

What words are there?

Examples:
  ""EDIT"": too short.
  ""EDUCT"": but D and U? E(1), D(2), U(3), C(4) -> but we need O at 4, not C. And C is excluded.

  ""E V O L T""? Not a word.

  ""E M O T E""? But that would be E M O T E -> positions: E(1), M(2), O(3) -> but we need O at 4, so no.

  ""E L O P T"": not 5 letters.

  ""EXPORT"": but R and P? E(1), X(2), P(3), O(4), R(5) -> but R is excluded.

  ""E V O T E""? Not a word.

  ""E V O I T""? Not a word.

  ""E V O L T"" is not a word.

  ""E F O U T""? Not a word.

  ""E C O S T"" -> but C and S are excluded.

This is difficult. Maybe T in position 5 is not common.

Now, try T in position 3: E _ T O _

We need position 2 and 5.

Words: E X T O Y

For example:
  ""ENTER"": E N T E R -> but N and R excluded, and also O not at 4? It's E N T E R -> positions: 1:E, 2:N, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> but we need O at 4, so no.

  ""ELTON"": E L T O N -> but N is excluded.

  ""METRO"": M E T R O -> but M(1), E(2) -> not starting with E.

  ""PETOS"": P E T O S -> not starting with E.

  ""DETOX"": D E T O X -> D(1), E(2) -> not starting with E.

  ""BETON"": B E T O N -> B(1), E(2) -> not starting with E.

  ""EXTOL"": E X T O L -> E(1), X(2), T(3), O(4), L(5). This fits the pattern. And letters: X, T, O, L. T and O are already known, and X and L are new. Also, X and L are not excluded.

  Is ""EXTOL"" a word? Yes, meaning: to praise highly.

  And it has T in position 3, which is one of the possibilities.

  Also, it includes L, which is a common letter.

  But note: we are not sure if T is in position 3 or 5. By guessing ""EXTOL"", we are assuming T is in position 3. If it is not, then we will get feedback that T is not in the word? But we know T is in the word, so if it's not in position 3, then it must be in position 5. And in that case, the feedback for T in position 3 will be a minus (since it's present but wrong position) and we will know that T is in position 5.

  Also, we get feedback on X and L.

  So this guess can help us.

  Another word: ""ECTOR""? Not a word.

  ""ENTOM""? Not a word.

  ""EXTO"" something.

  ""EXTOL"" seems good.

  But let's see if there is a word with T in position 5 that we can use.

  For example: ""E L O T S""? Not a word.

  ""E M O T E"" is 5 letters but O is at 3, not 4.

  ""E P O T S""? Not a word.

  ""E C O T Y""? No.

  ""E V O T E""? Not a word.

  ""E V O L T"" is not a word.

  ""E V O T E"" is not a word.

  ""E Y O T S""? Not a word.

  ""E Y O T H""? Not a word.

  ""E D O T S""? Not a word.

  ""E D O T H""? Not a word.

  ""E D O M T""? Not a word.

  ""E D O P T"" -> ""EDOPT"" is not a word. But ""ADOPT"" is, but we don't start with A.

  ""DEPOT"": D E P O T -> D(1), E(2) -> not starting with E.

  So it seems hard to find a word with T at the end and O at 4.

  Therefore, we go with ""EXTOL"".

  So guess: EXTOL

  This will test:
    E: should be correct (position 1) -> we expect a check.
    X: new letter, position 2.
    T: in position 3 -> if it is correct, we get a check; if not, we get a minus (because T is in the word) and then we know T must be in position 5.
    O: should be correct (position 4) -> we expect a check.
    L: new letter, position 5.

  And we avoid excluded letters.

  So let's go with that.

<guess>extol</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
