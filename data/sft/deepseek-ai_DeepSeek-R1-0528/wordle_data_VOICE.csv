First, I need to understand the feedback from the first guess. The guess was ""crane"", and the feedback was:

- C: - (meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
- R: x (R is not in the secret word)
- A: x (A is not in the secret word)
- N: x (N is not in the secret word)
- E: ✓ (E is in the word and in the correct position)

From this, I know:

1. The letter E is definitely in the secret word, and it's in the 5th position because it got a checkmark. So, position 5 is E.

2. The letter C is somewhere in the word, but not in the first position. Since position 1 was C in the guess, but it's wrong, C must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

3. R, A, and N are not in the word at all. So, the secret word does not contain R, A, or N.

The secret word is a 5-letter word ending with E, since position 5 is E.

Also, C is in the word but not position 1.

And we've eliminated R, A, N.

Now, I need to make a second guess. I should choose a word that:

- Has E in the 5th position because that's fixed.

- Includes C somewhere, but not in position 1, since we know C is present but misplaced.

- Avoids using R, A, N, since they're not in the word.

- Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Common consonants to try might include S, T, L, etc.

Since I need E at the end, I should look for words ending with E.

Also, C is somewhere else.

Let me think of possible words that end with E and contain C, without R, A, N.

But I don't know where C is yet; it could be in position 2, 3, or 4.

Moreover, I should consider positions where C might be.

Additionally, since I have few letters confirmed, I should include new letters to test.

Possible second guesses:

For example, ""price"": P-R-I-C-E. But R is excluded, since R got an x.

R is not in the word, so I can't use R.

A and N are also out.

So, ""price"" has R, which is invalid now.

""slice"": S-L-I-C-E. But I don't know about S, L, I yet.

Similarly, ""spice"": S-P-I-C-E, but P might not be good.

Since C is misplaced and position 1 was C (wrong), C must be in 2,3, or 4.

In the second guess, I should put C in a different position to test.

Position 1 had C and it was wrong, so if I put C in position 2, for example, I can see if it's correct there or not.

Similarly for other positions.

But I also know E is fixed at the end.

Let me list letters I can use: exclude R, A, N.

Common vowels: E is in, but E is only in position 5. Other vowels: O, U, sometimes Y, but probably not Y.

I is a possibility.

Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. But Y can be consonant or vowel.

For simplicity, stick to common ones.

Since E is fixed, I should think of words like _ _ _ _ E.

And C is in one of the first three positions? No, positions 1-4, but position 1 had C but was wrong, so C is not in pos 1. So C could be in 2,3, or 4.

In the word ""crane"", position 1: C (-), so C is elsewhere; position 2: R (x), not in word; position 3: A (x), not; position 4: N (x), not; position 5: E (✓).

So secret word has C and E, E at end, C somewhere in 2-4, and no R,A,N.

Possible letters for other positions.

I need a guess that has E at end, C in position 2,3 or 4 but not same as before, and new letters.

Also, since C might be in pos 2,3, or 4, I can try putting C in pos 2 for example.

But before that, in ""crane"", C was in pos 1 and got ""-"", meaning C is in word but wrong position. Since pos 1 was incorrect, C could be in 2,3,4 or even 5, but pos 5 is E, so C can't be in pos 5. So only 2,3,4 possible for C.

Similarly, E is fixed at 5.

Now for my second guess, I should try a word with C in position 2, for instance, to see if it matches.

If I put C in position 2 and it gets ""✓"", then I know C is at position 2.

But it might not be.

Similarly, I can include other common letters.

A good strategy is to use a word with letters that haven't been tried, to get more information.

Available letters: many to try.

Common words: let's think ""slice"": positions: S L I C E. But I tried C in pos 4? In ""crane"" C was pos 1, C is now in pos 4.

""slice"" has C in position 4.

If secret word has C in position 4, it would be correct, else if in other positions, it might be misplaced or wrong.

I could also avoid repeating the same C position as before.

In ""crane"", C was pos 1, so try a different position.

But pos 1 is not possible, so try pos 2 or 3 or 4.

Perhaps try ""scope"": S C O P E, but has O, P, etc.

O and P are new.

But ""scope"" has C in pos 2.

And E in pos 5.

Also, no R,A,N.

Similarly, other options: ""shine"", but that has H,I,N,E; N is excluded, so can't use N.

N was excluded.

""bike"" is 4 letters, need 5.

""slice"": S L I C E all letters except S,L,I haven't been tried, and E is known.

C is in position 4 here.

In ""crane"", C was position 1, so putting C in position 4 is different.

Similarly, ""quite"": Q U I T E, but Q might not be common, and no C, but I need to include C because we know C is in the word and I should confirm its position.

In my second guess, I should include C to test its position.

Because we know C is present, I should reuse C to find where it is.

Similarly, E is fixed.

So, good to have C in the word again, in a different position.

For example, put C in position 2.

Words like ""scent"": S C E N T, but N is excluded, so invalid.

""scene"": S C E E N, but two E's, but position 3 and 4 are E, but pos 5 is also E? ""scene"" is S-C-E-E-N? Positions: 1-S, 2-C, 3-E, 4-E, 5-N. But N is excluded, and also position 3 and 4 have E, but we only know position 5 has E, so it might not have E elsewhere.

Moreover, N is out.

""cease"": C E A S E, but A is excluded, C is in position 1, which was wrong before, so if I put C in position 1 again, but we know position 1 was wrong, so probably C is not position 1, so putting C in position 1 might give ""x"" or something, but it could be redundant.

To avoid wasting, best to put C in a possible position: 2,3,4.

Similarly, avoid known absent letters.

Let's think of words ending with E, containing C, no R,A,N.

Common words: ""price"" but has R.

""voice"": V O I C E, has O,I,V, no R,A,N.

C in position 4.

"" slice"": S L I C E.

C in position 4.

""spice"": S P I C E.

C in position 4.

""trace"": T R A C E, but R and A are excluded, so invalid.

""close"": C L O S E, but C is in position 1, and we know position 1 is not C, so putting C in position 1 might not give new info, or it could confirm it's wrong.

Since it's wrong, if I put C in position 1, it might get ""x"" which tells me nothing new, because I know it's wrong.

Better to put it in a possible position.

So ""close"" has C in pos 1, not good.

""scale"": S C A L E, but A is excluded.

""while"": W H I L E, but no C.

I need C in the word.

So words like ""voice"" : V O I C E

Or ""slice"" : S L I C E

Or ""since"" : S I N C E, but N is excluded.

N is out, so ""since"" invalid.

""mince"" : M I N C E, N out.

""force"" : F O R C E, R out.

""pence"" : P E N C E, N out.

""hence"" : H E N C E, N out.

So many have N.

""dodge"" : D O D G E, no C.

I need words with C and ending E.

"" juice"" : J U I C E, has U,I.

J and U are less common, but possible.

"" peace"" : P E A C E, A out.

""dice"" has only 4 letters.

5-letter: ""ounce"" O U N C E, N out.

""bounce"" too long.

Struggling to find words.

""chose"" : C H O S E, but C in position 1.

Position 1 is not good for C.

Perhaps ""cache"", but ends with E? ""cache"" is C-A-C-H-E? Positions 1-C,2-A,3-C,4-H,5-E. But A is excluded, and also C repeated? Not efficient.

But A is out, so not good.

""niche"" N I C H E, N out.

""syce"" not a word, or rare.

Common word: ""slice"" seems good: S-L-I-C-E.

Letters S, L, I haven't been tried, C is at position 4, E at position 5.

If secret word has C at position 4, it should be ""✓"", else ""-"" or ""x"", but we know C is in word, so if not position 4, it will be ""-"" for wrong position.

Similarly, S, L, I are new, so I can learn about them.

Another word: ""spice"" S-P-I-C-E.

P is new.

""voice"" V-O-I-C-E.

V and O are new.

All seem reasonable.

Since there are many possibilities, I should choose a word that has diverse letters to maximize information.

For example, avoiding repeated letters.

""slice"" has all distinct letters: S,L,I,C,E.

E is known, but still good.

Similarly, ""spice"" S,P,I,C,E distinct.

"" voice"" V,O,I,C,E distinct.

Now, I need to pick one.

Perhaps start with common letters like S or T.

Another idea: position 2 was R in crane but it was absent, so I could try a letter in position 2 to see if it matches.

In my guess, I can probe positions.

For example, in position 2, I should try a common letter.

But with E fixed at 5, and C must be in 2,3, or4.

If I try a word with C in position 2, for instance.

So let's find a word with C in position 2 and E at end.

For example, ""scene"" but has N and E repeated, not good.

""acced"" not a word.

""scare"" but has A and R, excluded.

Difficult.

""score"" S-C-O-R-E, but R excluded.

""scope"" S-C-O-P-E.

""scope"" has no R,A,N, so S C O P E, with C in position 2, E in position 5.

O and P are new.

That could work.

Similarly, ""scree"" has repeated letters, bad.

""shade"" but no C and A.

So ""scope"" or ""slice"".

""slice"" has C in position 4, ""scope"" has C in position 2.

Both possible.

Maybe ""spice"" C in position 4.

I think ""scope"" might be better because it puts C in a different position than before (position 2 vs position 1 in crane).

Similarly, in slice C is position 4, also different.

Both fine.

Let's go with ""scope"" for the second guess.

So ""scope"": S C O P E

Feedback will tell me:

- If S is in word,

- C in position 2: if ""✓"", then correct position; if ""-"", wrong position but in word; if ""x"", not in word, but we know it is, so probably not ""x"".

Similarly for O and P.

E is known correct.

So I think ""scope"" is a good guess.

Another common word: ""trace"" but excluded letters.

""house"" no C.

""slice"" is also good.

But ""scope"" uses S,C,O,P,E.

O and P are good to test.

Similarly, ""voice"" has V which is less common, but possible.

I think ""scope"" or ""slice"" or ""spice"".

I'll go with ""scope"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", we know the following:
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1 (since it received ""-"", indicating it is misplaced).
- R, A, and N are not in the secret word (each received ""x"").
- E is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5, based on the ""✓"").

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must end with E (position 5).
- Contains C, but not in position 1 (so C must be in position 2, 3, or 4).
- Does not contain R, A, or N.

For the second guess:
- It must have E in position 5 to satisfy the known correct position.
- It should include C, but in a different position than position 1 to test possible locations (e.g., position 2, 3, or 4).
- It should avoid letters R, A, and N, as they are not in the word.
- To maximize information, the guess should introduce new common letters (e.g., S, O, P, L, I) to test their presence and positions.

A strong second guess is ""scope"":
- Letters: S in position 1, C in position 2, O in position 3, P in position 4, E in position 5.
- This places C in position 2, testing if it is in the correct position.
- It introduces new letters S, O, and P, which are common and can provide feedback on their presence/position.
- It has no repeated letters or excluded letters (R, A, N).

This guess will help narrow down the position of C and provide information on S, O, and P.

<guess>scope</guess>",scope,"First, I need to understand the feedback from the first guess. The guess was ""crane"", and the feedback was:

- C: - (meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
- R: x (R is not in the secret word)

""while"": W H I L E, but no C.

I need C in the word.

So words like ""voice"" : V O I C E

Or ""slice"" : S L I C E

Or ""since"" : S I N C E, but N is excluded.

N is out, so ""since"" invalid.

""mince"" : M I N C E, N out.

""force"" : F O R C E, R out.

""pence"" : P E N C E, N out.

""hence"" : H E N C E, N out.

So many have N.

""dodge"" : D O D G E, no C.

I need words with C and ending E.

"" juice"" : J U I C E, has U,I.

J and U are less common, but possible.

"" peace"" : P E A C E, A out.

""dice"" has only 4 letters.

5-letter: ""ounce"" O U N C E, N out.

""bounce"" too long.

Struggling to find words.

""chose"" : C H O S E, but C in position 1.

Position 1 is not good for C.

Perhaps ""cache"", but ends with E? ""cache"" is C-A-C-H-E? Positions 1-C,2-A,3-C,4-H,5-E. But A is excluded, and also C repeated? Not efficient.

But A is out, so not good.

""niche"" N I C H E, N out.

""syce"" not a word, or rare.

Common word: ""slice"" seems good: S-L-I-C-E.

Letters S, L, I haven't been tried, C is at position 4, E at position 5.

If secret word has C at position 4, it should be ""✓"", else ""-"" or ""x"", but we know C is in word, so if not position 4, it will be ""-"" for wrong position.

Similarly, S, L, I are new, so I can learn about them.

Another word: ""spice"" S-P-I-C-E.

P is new.

""voice"" V-O-I-C-E.

V and O are new.

All seem reasonable.

Since there are many possibilities, I should choose a word that has diverse letters to maximize information.

For example, avoiding repeated letters.

""slice"" has all distinct letters: S,L,I,C,E.

E is known, but still good.

Similarly, ""spice"" S,P,I,C,E distinct.

"" voice"" V,O,I,C,E distinct.

Now, I need to pick one.

Perhaps start with common letters like S or T.

Another idea: position 2 was R in crane but it was absent, so I could try a letter in position 2 to see if it matches.

In my guess, I can probe positions.

For example, in position 2, I should try a common letter.

But with E fixed at 5, and C must be in 2,3, or4.

If I try a word with C in position 2, for instance.

So let's find a word with C in position 2 and E at end.

For example, ""scene"" but has N and E repeated, not good.

""acced"" not a word.

""scare"" but has A and R, excluded.

Difficult.

""score"" S-C-O-R-E, but R excluded.

""scope"" S-C-O-P-E.

""scope"" has no R,A,N, so S C O P E, with C in position 2, E in position 5.

O and P are new.

That could work.

Similarly, ""scree"" has repeated letters, bad.

""shade"" but no C and A.

So ""scope"" or ""slice"".

""slice"" has C in position 4, ""scope"" has C in position 2.

Both possible.

Maybe ""spice"" C in position 4.

I think ""scope"" might be better because it puts C in a different position than before (position 2 vs position 1 in crane).

Similarly, in slice C is position 4, also different.

Both fine.

Let's go with ""scope"" for the second guess.

So ""scope"": S C O P E

Feedback will tell me:

- If S is in word,

- C in position 2: if ""✓"", then correct position; if ""-"", wrong position but in word; if ""x"", not in word, but we know it is, so probably not ""x"".

Similarly for O and P.

E is known correct.

So I think ""scope"" is a good guess.

Another common word: ""trace"" but excluded letters.

""house"" no C.

""slice"" is also good.

But ""scope"" uses S,C,O,P,E.

O and P are good to test.

Similarly, ""voice"" has V which is less common, but possible.

I think ""scope"" or ""slice"" or ""spice"".

I'll go with ""scope"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", we know the following:
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1 (since it received ""-"", indicating it is misplaced).
- R, A, and N are not in the secret word (each received ""x"").
- E is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5, based on the ""✓"").

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must end with E (position 5).
- Contains C, but not in position 1 (so C must be in position 2, 3, or 4).
- Does not contain R, A, or N.

For the second guess:
- It must have E in position 5 to satisfy the known correct position.
- It should include C, but in a different position than position 1 to test possible locations (e.g., position 2, 3, or 4).
- It should avoid letters R, A, and N, as they are not in the word.
- To maximize information, the guess should introduce new common letters (e.g., S, O, P, L, I) to test their presence and positions.

A strong second guess is ""scope"":
- Letters: S in position 1, C in position 2, O in position 3, P in position 4, E in position 5.
- This places C in position 2, testing if it is in the correct position.
- It introduces new letters S, O, and P, which are common and can provide feedback on their presence/position.
- It has no repeated letters or excluded letters (R, A, N).

This guess will help narrow down the position of C and provide information on S, O, and P.",Guess 2: scope -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(-) O(-) P(x) E(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to understand the feedback from the first guess. The guess was ""crane"", and the feedback was:

- C: - (meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
- R: x (R is not in the secret word)
- A: x (A is not in the secret word)
- N: x (N is not in the secret word)
- E: ✓ (E is in the word and in the correct position)

From this, I know:

1. The letter E is definitely in the secret word, and it's in the 5th position because it got a checkmark. So, position 5 is E.

2. The letter C is somewhere in the word, but not in the first position. Since position 1 was C in the guess, but it's wrong, C must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

3. R, A, and N are not in the word at all. So, the secret word does not contain R, A, or N.

The secret word is a 5-letter word ending with E, since position 5 is E.

Also, C is in the word but not position 1.

And we've eliminated R, A, N.

Now, I need to make a second guess. I should choose a word that:

- Has E in the 5th position because that's fixed.

- Includes C somewhere, but not in position 1, since we know C is present but misplaced.

- Avoids using R, A, N, since they're not in the word.

- Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Common consonants to try might include S, T, L, etc.

Since I need E at the end, I should look for words ending with E.

Also, C is somewhere else.

Let me think of possible words that end with E and contain C, without R, A, N.

But I don't know where C is yet; it could be in position 2, 3, or 4.

Moreover, I should consider positions where C might be.

Additionally, since I have few letters confirmed, I should include new letters to test.

Possible second guesses:

For example, ""price"": P-R-I-C-E. But R is excluded, since R got an x.

R is not in the word, so I can't use R.

A and N are also out.

So, ""price"" has R, which is invalid now.

""slice"": S-L-I-C-E. But I don't know about S, L, I yet.

Similarly, ""spice"": S-P-I-C-E, but P might not be good.

Since C is misplaced and position 1 was C (wrong), C must be in 2,3, or 4.

In the second guess, I should put C in a different position to test.

Position 1 had C and it was wrong, so if I put C in position 2, for example, I can see if it's correct there or not.

Similarly for other positions.

But I also know E is fixed at the end.

Let me list letters I can use: exclude R, A, N.

Common vowels: E is in, but E is only in position 5. Other vowels: O, U, sometimes Y, but probably not Y.

I is a possibility.

Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. But Y can be consonant or vowel.

For simplicity, stick to common ones.

Since E is fixed, I should think of words like _ _ _ _ E.

And C is in one of the first three positions? No, positions 1-4, but position 1 had C but was wrong, so C is not in pos 1. So C could be in 2,3, or 4.

In the word ""crane"", position 1: C (-), so C is elsewhere; position 2: R (x), not in word; position 3: A (x), not; position 4: N (x), not; position 5: E (✓).

So secret word has C and E, E at end, C somewhere in 2-4, and no R,A,N.

Possible letters for other positions.

I need a guess that has E at end, C in position 2,3 or 4 but not same as before, and new letters.

Also, since C might be in pos 2,3, or 4, I can try putting C in pos 2 for example.

But before that, in ""crane"", C was in pos 1 and got ""-"", meaning C is in word but wrong position. Since pos 1 was incorrect, C could be in 2,3,4 or even 5, but pos 5 is E, so C can't be in pos 5. So only 2,3,4 possible for C.

Similarly, E is fixed at 5.

Now for my second guess, I should try a word with C in position 2, for instance, to see if it matches.

If I put C in position 2 and it gets ""✓"", then I know C is at position 2.

But it might not be.

Similarly, I can include other common letters.

A good strategy is to use a word with letters that haven't been tried, to get more information.

Available letters: many to try.

Common words: let's think ""slice"": positions: S L I C E. But I tried C in pos 4? In ""crane"" C was pos 1, C is now in pos 4.

""slice"" has C in position 4.

If secret word has C in position 4, it would be correct, else if in other positions, it might be misplaced or wrong.

I could also avoid repeating the same C position as before.

In ""crane"", C was pos 1, so try a different position.

But pos 1 is not possible, so try pos 2 or 3 or 4.

Perhaps try ""scope"": S C O P E, but has O, P, etc.

O and P are new.

But ""scope"" has C in pos 2.

And E in pos 5.

Also, no R,A,N.

Similarly, other options: ""shine"", but that has H,I,N,E; N is excluded, so can't use N.

N was excluded.

""bike"" is 4 letters, need 5.

""slice"": S L I C E all letters except S,L,I haven't been tried, and E is known.

C is in position 4 here.

In ""crane"", C was position 1, so putting C in position 4 is different.

Similarly, ""quite"": Q U I T E, but Q might not be common, and no C, but I need to include C because we know C is in the word and I should confirm its position.

In my second guess, I should include C to test its position.

Because we know C is present, I should reuse C to find where it is.

Similarly, E is fixed.

So, good to have C in the word again, in a different position.

For example, put C in position 2.

Words like ""scent"": S C E N T, but N is excluded, so invalid.

""scene"": S C E E N, but two E's, but position 3 and 4 are E, but pos 5 is also E? ""scene"" is S-C-E-E-N? Positions: 1-S, 2-C, 3-E, 4-E, 5-N. But N is excluded, and also position 3 and 4 have E, but we only know position 5 has E, so it might not have E elsewhere.

Moreover, N is out.

""cease"": C E A S E, but A is excluded, C is in position 1, which was wrong before, so if I put C in position 1 again, but we know position 1 was wrong, so probably C is not position 1, so putting C in position 1 might give ""x"" or something, but it could be redundant.

To avoid wasting, best to put C in a possible position: 2,3,4.

Similarly, avoid known absent letters.

Let's think of words ending with E, containing C, no R,A,N.

Common words: ""price"" but has R.

""voice"": V O I C E, has O,I,V, no R,A,N.

C in position 4.

"" slice"": S L I C E.

C in position 4.

""spice"": S P I C E.

C in position 4.

""trace"": T R A C E, but R and A are excluded, so invalid.

""close"": C L O S E, but C is in position 1, and we know position 1 is not C, so putting C in position 1 might not give new info, or it could confirm it's wrong.

Since it's wrong, if I put C in position 1, it might get ""x"" which tells me nothing new, because I know it's wrong.

Better to put it in a possible position.

So ""close"" has C in pos 1, not good.

""scale"": S C A L E, but A is excluded.

""while"": W H I L E, but no C.

I need C in the word.

So words like ""voice"" : V O I C E

Or ""slice"" : S L I C E

Or ""since"" : S I N C E, but N is excluded.

N is out, so ""since"" invalid.

""mince"" : M I N C E, N out.

""force"" : F O R C E, R out.

""pence"" : P E N C E, N out.

""hence"" : H E N C E, N out.

So many have N.

""dodge"" : D O D G E, no C.

I need words with C and ending E.

"" juice"" : J U I C E, has U,I.

J and U are less common, but possible.

"" peace"" : P E A C E, A out.

""dice"" has only 4 letters.

5-letter: ""ounce"" O U N C E, N out.

""bounce"" too long.

Struggling to find words.

""chose"" : C H O S E, but C in position 1.

Position 1 is not good for C.

Perhaps ""cache"", but ends with E? ""cache"" is C-A-C-H-E? Positions 1-C,2-A,3-C,4-H,5-E. But A is excluded, and also C repeated? Not efficient.

But A is out, so not good.

""niche"" N I C H E, N out.

""syce"" not a word, or rare.

Common word: ""slice"" seems good: S-L-I-C-E.

Letters S, L, I haven't been tried, C is at position 4, E at position 5.

If secret word has C at position 4, it should be ""✓"", else ""-"" or ""x"", but we know C is in word, so if not position 4, it will be ""-"" for wrong position.

Similarly, S, L, I are new, so I can learn about them.

Another word: ""spice"" S-P-I-C-E.

P is new.

""voice"" V-O-I-C-E.

V and O are new.

All seem reasonable.

Since there are many possibilities, I should choose a word that has diverse letters to maximize information.

For example, avoiding repeated letters.

""slice"" has all distinct letters: S,L,I,C,E.

E is known, but still good.

Similarly, ""spice"" S,P,I,C,E distinct.

"" voice"" V,O,I,C,E distinct.

Now, I need to pick one.

Perhaps start with common letters like S or T.

Another idea: position 2 was R in crane but it was absent, so I could try a letter in position 2 to see if it matches.

In my guess, I can probe positions.

For example, in position 2, I should try a common letter.

But with E fixed at 5, and C must be in 2,3, or4.

If I try a word with C in position 2, for instance.

So let's find a word with C in position 2 and E at end.

For example, ""scene"" but has N and E repeated, not good.

""acced"" not a word.

""scare"" but has A and R, excluded.

Difficult.

""score"" S-C-O-R-E, but R excluded.

""scope"" S-C-O-P-E.

""scope"" has no R,A,N, so S C O P E, with C in position 2, E in position 5.

O and P are new.

That could work.

Similarly, ""scree"" has repeated letters, bad.

""shade"" but no C and A.

So ""scope"" or ""slice"".

""slice"" has C in position 4, ""scope"" has C in position 2.

Both possible.

Maybe ""spice"" C in position 4.

I think ""scope"" might be better because it puts C in a different position than before (position 2 vs position 1 in crane).

Similarly, in slice C is position 4, also different.

Both fine.

Let's go with ""scope"" for the second guess.

So ""scope"": S C O P E

Feedback will tell me:

- If S is in word,

- C in position 2: if ""✓"", then correct position; if ""-"", wrong position but in word; if ""x"", not in word, but we know it is, so probably not ""x"".

Similarly for O and P.

E is known correct.

So I think ""scope"" is a good guess.

Another common word: ""trace"" but excluded letters.

""house"" no C.

""slice"" is also good.

But ""scope"" uses S,C,O,P,E.

O and P are good to test.

Similarly, ""voice"" has V which is less common, but possible.

I think ""scope"" or ""slice"" or ""spice"".

I'll go with ""scope"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", we know the following:
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1 (since it received ""-"", indicating it is misplaced).
- R, A, and N are not in the secret word (each received ""x"").
- E is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5, based on the ""✓"").

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must end with E (position 5).
- Contains C, but not in position 1 (so C must be in position 2, 3, or 4).
- Does not contain R, A, or N.

For the second guess:
- It must have E in position 5 to satisfy the known correct position.
- It should include C, but in a different position than position 1 to test possible locations (e.g., position 2, 3, or 4).
- It should avoid letters R, A, and N, as they are not in the word.
- To maximize information, the guess should introduce new common letters (e.g., S, O, P, L, I) to test their presence and positions.

A strong second guess is ""scope"":
- Letters: S in position 1, C in position 2, O in position 3, P in position 4, E in position 5.
- This places C in position 2, testing if it is in the correct position.
- It introduces new letters S, O, and P, which are common and can provide feedback on their presence/position.
- It has no repeated letters or excluded letters (R, A, N).

This guess will help narrow down the position of C and provide information on S, O, and P.

In ""crane"" C was pos 1, C is now in pos 4.\n\n""slice"" has C in position 4.\n\nIf secret word has C in position 4, it would be correct, else if in other positions, it might be misplaced or wrong.\n\nI could also avoid repeating the same C position as before.\n\nIn ""crane"", C was pos 1, so try a different position.\n\nBut pos 1 is not possible, so try pos 2 or 3 or 4.\n\nPerhaps try ""scope"": S C O P E, but has O, P, etc.\n\nO and P are new.\n\nBut ""scope"" has C in pos 2.\n\nAnd E in pos 5.\n\nAlso, no R,A,N.\n\nSimilarly, other options: ""shine"", but that has H,I,N,E; N is excluded, so can\'t use N.\n\nN was excluded.\n\n""bike"" is 4 letters, need 5.\n\n""slice"": S L I C E all letters except S,L,I haven\'t been tried, and E is known.\n\nC is in position 4 here.\n\nIn ""crane"", C was position 1, so putting C in position 4 is different.\n\nSimilarly, ""quite"": Q U I T E, but Q might not be common, and no C, but I need to include C because we know C is in the word and I should confirm its position.\n\nIn my second guess, I should include C to test its position.\n\nBecause we know C is present, I should reuse C to find where it is.\n\nSimilarly, E is fixed.\n\nSo, good to have C in the word again, in a different position.\n\nFor example, put C in position 2.\n\nWords like ""scent"": S C E N T, but N is excluded, so invalid.\n\n""scene"": S C E E N, but two E\'s, but position 3 and 4 are E, but pos 5 is also E?

But N is excluded, and also position 3 and 4 have E, but we only know position 5 has E, so it might not have E elsewhere.\n\nMoreover, N is out.\n\n""cease"": C E A S E, but A is excluded, C is in position 1, which was wrong before, so if I put C in position 1 again, but we know position 1 was wrong, so probably C is not position 1, so putting C in position 1 might give ""x"" or something, but it could be redundant.\n\nTo avoid wasting, best to put C in a possible position: 2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly, avoid known absent letters.\n\nLet\'s think of words ending with E, containing C, no R,A,N.\n\nCommon words: ""price"" but has R.\n\n""voice"": V O I C E, has O,I,V, no R,A,N.\n\nC in position 4.\n\n"" slice"": S L I C E.\n\nC in position 4.\n\n""spice"": S P I C E.\n\nC in position 4.\n\n""trace"": T R A C E, but R and A are excluded, so invalid.\n\n""close"": C L O S E, but C is in position 1, and we know position 1 is not C, so putting C in position 1 might not give new info, or it could confirm it\'s wrong.\n\nSince it\'s wrong, if I put C in position 1, it might get ""x"" which tells me nothing new, because I know it\'s wrong.\n\nBetter to put it in a possible position.\n\nSo ""close"" has C in pos 1, not good.\n\n""scale"": S C A L E, but A is excluded.\n\n""while"": W H I L E, but no C.\n\nI need C in the word.\n\nSo words like ""voice"" : V O I C E\n\nOr ""slice"" : S L I C E\n\nOr ""since"" : S I N C E, but N is excluded.\n\nN is out, so ""since"" invalid.\n\n""mince"" : M I N C E, N out.\n\n""force"" : F O R C E, R out.\n\n""pence"" : P E N C E, N out.\n\n""hence"" : H E N C E, N out.\n\nSo many have N.\n\n""dodge"" : D O D G E, no C.\n\nI need words with C and ending E.\n\n"" juice"" : J U I C E, has U,I.\n\nJ and U are less common, but possible.\n\n"" peace"" : P E A C E, A out.\n\n""dice"" has only 4 letters.\n\n5-letter: ""ounce"" O U N C E, N out.\n\n""bounce"" too long.\n\nStruggling to find words.\n\n""chose"" : C H O S E, but C in position 1.\n\nPosition 1 is not good for C.\n\nPerhaps ""cache"", but ends with E?

Okay, let's analyze the feedback step by step to figure out the next guess.

First, recall the secret word has E at position 5 (from the first guess) and contains C somewhere (not position 1, and not position 2 due to new feedback).

Now, the second guess ""scope"" gave feedback:
- S: x → S is not in the secret word
- C: - → C is in the word but misplaced (here placed in position 2, so C is not in position 2)
- O: - → O is in the word but misplaced (position 3 was wrong)
- P: x → P is not in the word
- E: ✓ → E is correctly in position 5 (known)

So now we know:
- O is in the secret word, but not in position 3 (since ""-"")
- C is present, but not in position 1 or 2 (from ""crane"" and ""scope"")
- E in position 5 confirmed
- S and P are absent
- A, N, R were already absent from first guess

Possible positions for C: since it can't be position 1 (from ""crane"") or 2 (from ""scope""), and position 5 is E, C must be in position 3 or 4.

O must be somewhere, not position 3. Possible positions: 1, 2, 4 (since 5 is E).

Now, to construct the next guess:
- E must be at position 5.
- C must be in position 3 or 4 (to test its location).
- O must be included but not in position 3 (so try position 1, 2, or 4).
- Must avoid S, P, A, R, N (all confirmed absent).

I should choose a word that tests possible positions:
- If I put C in position 3, O in position 2 (for example), to see if they match.
- Also include new common letters like T, L, I, U, etc., to get more coverage.

Possible words meeting this criteria:
- Must end with E
- Include C and O
- C somewhere in position 3 or 4
- O not in position 3
- Avoid absent letters: A, R, N, S, P

Try C in position 3:
- Words like ""locle"" not valid
- ""focal"" doesn't end with E
- ""tower"" lacks C and has R which is out

Other options: C in position 4?
- Word ""voice"" : V-O-I-C-E → positions 1:V, 2:O, 3:I, 4:C, 5:E
- This places O in position 2, C in position 4
- Avoids forbidden letters (V, I are new)
- If C is actually in position 4, it should be correct; if not, misplaced (but we know C must be in 3 or 4)
- Similarly for O: if position 2 is correct? Or test placement

""voice"" seems valid and efficient:
- Tests C at position 4
- Tests O at position 2 (since not position 3)
- Introduces V and I
- E at position 5

Other possibilities:
- ""movie"" but M-O-V-I-E, lacks C → can't omit C
- ""beige"" misses O and C
- ""voice"" stands out as a strong candidate with distinct new letters

So ""voice"" should be the next guess. If not, alternatives like ""quick"" but Q is rare and lacks E, or ""covey"" has Y and lacks E ending? ""covey"" ends with Y not E.

Thus ""voice"" is optimal for now.

Based on the cumulative feedback:

- **Previous Feedback Analysis**:
  - From ""crane"" (Guess 1):
    - C is in the word, but not in position 1.
    - R, A, N are not in the word.
    - E is in the word and in position 5 (correct).
  - From ""scope"" (Guess 2):
    - S and P are not in the word.
    - C is in the word but not in position 2 (misplaced).
    - O is in the word but not in position 3 (misplaced).
    - E is confirmed in position 5 (correct).
  
- **Key Insights**:
  - The secret word **must end with E** (position 5).
  - C is present but **cannot be in position 1 or 2** (must be in position 3 or 4).
  - O is present but **cannot be in position 3** (possible positions: 1, 2, or 4).
  - Excluded letters: R, A, N, S, P (these are not in the word).
  - New guess must include C and O to clarify their positions, and introduce new letters to gather more information.

- **Strategy for Next Guess**:
  - Place E in position 5 to satisfy the known correct position.
  - Place C in either position 3 or 4 (testing its location).
  - Place O in a new position (e.g., position 2 or 4) to test its placement.
  - Avoid reused letters to maximize new information—use common untested letters like V, I, L, T, etc.
  - The word ""voice"" fits well: it has V and I (new letters), O in position 2, C in position 4, and E in position 5. This tests potential positions for both C and O while introducing high-frequency consonants/vowels.
