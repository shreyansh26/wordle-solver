Hmm, the user is asking me to make my first 5-letter word guess in the Wordle-like game. Since it's the first guess, I need to choose a word strategically to maximize information gathering.  

The most effective opening words usually contain common letters and a balanced vowel-consonant distribution. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROATE"" are popular among players because they cover frequent letters (R, S, T, L, E) and vowels (A, E, O).  

Testing vowel distribution might be wise since vowels are critical in English words. A word with multiple vowels could quickly narrow down possibilities. Let me consider ""ADIEU"" – it covers four vowels (A, E, I, U) but lacks consonant coverage. Alternatively, ""CRANE"" feels better: it has two vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N), plus it's from the original Wordle solutions list.  

""SOARE"" is another strong contender (birds are common in Wordle), but I recall the user's rules don't specify using only solution words – just valid English words. Still, ""CRANE"" seems safer.  

Final choice: ""CRANE"" gives me ✓/- feedback for C, R, A, N, E positions while covering statistically useful letters. It's a textbook opener.  

Now, to respond: I'll start with reasoning in `<thinking>` (though hidden per format), then output `<guess>crane</guess>`.

Based on Wordle strategy principles, an effective first guess should:  
1. Include a mix of common vowels (e.g., A, E) and consonants (e.g., R, S, T, N),  
2. Avoid repeating letters to maximize coverage.

Alright, let me process the feedback from the first guess. I guessed ""CRANE"" and got quite a lot of information from it:

- C, R, A are all marked as ""x"", meaning none of these letters appear in the secret word at all. That immediately eliminates a big chunk of possibilities.
- N and E are marked as ""-"", so both N and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions I guessed them in.

Breaking this down:

1. **Letters to exclude:** C, R, A are completely out. That's significant because R and A are very common letters. The secret word must avoid these entirely.
2. **Letters to include:** Both N and E must be in the word somewhere, but:
   - N is not in the 4th position (since I guessed it there and it's wrong position).
   - E is not in the 5th position (since I guessed it there and it's wrong position).

So the secret word:
- Contains N and E
- Excludes C, R, A
- Is 5 letters long

Now, I need a new guess that incorporates these constraints:
- Must include N and E (but not in positions 4 or 5 respectively)
- Must exclude C, R, A
- Should test new letters to gather more information

Since N and E are confirmed in the word, I'll prioritize keeping them in my next guess but in different positions to test their real locations. I'll also introduce new common letters since C/R/A are out—good candidates would be T, O, S, L, M, etc.

Possible approach:
1. **Reposition N:** Since N wasn't in position 4, I could try it in position 2, 3, or 5.
2. **Reposition E:** Since E wasn't in position 5, I could move it to position 1, 2, or 3.
3. **New letters:** Test other common letters like T, O, S, L, etc.

I should avoid positions where we already ruled them out, though:

- Since N was eliminated from position 4, I can place it in 1,2,3, or 5, but caution: position 5 was originally E's spot which might conflict if I put N there. Similarly, E can't be in position 5 so I have to avoid that placement.

Given E is highly likely to be somewhere in positions 1-4, and N cannot be in position 4.

Good second guesses should maximize information:
- Keep N and E to verify their positions
- Use fresh high-frequency letters: S, T, L, O, M, D, etc.

Considering possible words that fit:
- Must include N and E
- Exclude C, R, A

For example:
- Words like **STONE**, **STEIN**, **LEMON**, **MEANT**, **SPINE**
  
Now evaluating each:
- **STONE**: S T O N E → Tests S,T,O (new), keeps N/E but moves them (N to position 4 was bad, but I'm trying position 4 again? Wait, the feedback said N was present but not in position 4—so placing it in position 4 again is useless. I should move N to a new spot to test its real location.)
  
Better alternatives where N and E shift positions:
- **MEANT**: M E A N T → But A is excluded! Invalid, since A is ruled out.
- **SPINE**: S P I N E → This is better. Places E in position 5? But E cannot be in position 5 per feedback. So invalid placement.
  
Ah, constraint: E cannot be in position 5. So any candidate must place E in positions 1-4 and N not in position 4.

Good options:
- **N** can be in positions 1,2,3,5
- **E** can be in 1,2,3,4
  
Look for words featuring N and E while avoiding positions that are forbidden AND excluding C,R,A.

Strong candidate: **STEIN** (S,T,E,I,N)
- It places E in position 3 (avoiding position 5)
- Places N in position 5 (since position 4 was bad, trying a new spot)
- Tests S,T,I (new letters)
- Avoids C,R,A

Another option: **TOKEN** (T,O,K,E,N) but O and K might be less common.

**STEIN** seems solid:
- Gives chance to confirm positions of E (pos3) and N (pos5). If either lights up as ""✓"", we've nailed them. If ""-"", we know they're elsewhere but still in the word.

Alternatively, **LINES** (L,I,N,E,S) — but N in position 3 (which might be fine), E in 4. Avoids position 4 for N? Yes. Also avoids E in position 5.

But **LINES** ends with S. That might be okay since S is common. However, starting with L tests a less frequent letter? Not crucial—S,T are higher frequency anyway.

Comparing:
**STEIN**: Tests S,T,E,I,N with E in position 3 and N in position 5—new positions for both ruled-out placements.

**LINES**: N in position 3 (new), E in position 4 (also new position for E). This is fairly equivalent too.

I'll select **STEIN** since T and S feel slightly more common than L and I. Plus “stein” is a familiar word.

Therefore, next guess: STEIN

Let me validate:
- Includes N and E
- Avoids C,R,A
- Repositions both (E not in 5th, N not in 4th)
- Tests S,T,I—high-value consonants.

Seems strategically sound.

Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (""CRANE"" → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)):  
- **C, R, A** are **completely absent** from the secret word.  
- **N and E** are **present**, but **not in position 4** (for N) or **position 5** (for E).  

For the next guess:  
- Must include **N and E** (with N not in position 4; E not in position 5).  
- Must exclude C, R, A.  
- To maximize information, focus on **high-frequency letters** (e.g., S, T, L, O) and reposition N/E to untested spots.  

I chose **STEIN**:  
- Tests S/T/I (new common letters) while retaining N/E in new positions (E in position 3; N in position 5).  
- Avoids C/R/A entirely.  
- Efficiently probes E/N positions and expands letter coverage.

- Since N was eliminated from position 4, I can place it in 1,2,3, or 5, but caution: position 5 was originally E's spot which might conflict if I put N there. Similarly, E can't be in position 5 so I have to avoid that placement.

Given E is highly likely to be somewhere in positions 1-4, and N cannot be in position 4.

Good second guesses should maximize information:
- Keep N and E to verify their positions
- Use fresh high-frequency letters: S, T, L, O, M, D, etc.

Considering possible words that fit:
- Must include N and E
- Exclude C, R, A

For example:
- Words like **STONE**, **STEIN**, **LEMON**, **MEANT**, **SPINE**
  
Now evaluating each:
- **STONE**: S T O N E → Tests S,T,O (new), keeps N/E but moves them (N to position 4 was bad, but I'm trying position 4 again? Wait, the feedback said N was present but not in position 4—so placing it in position 4 again is useless. I should move N to a new spot to test its real location.)
  
Better alternatives where N and E shift positions:
- **MEANT**: M E A N T → But A is excluded! Invalid, since A is ruled out.
- **SPINE**: S P I N E → This is better. Places E in position 5? But E cannot be in position 5 per feedback. So invalid placement.
  
Ah, constraint: E cannot be in position 5. So any candidate must place E in positions 1-4 and N not in position 4.

Good options:
- **N** can be in positions 1,2,3,5
- **E** can be in 1,2,3,4
  
Look for words featuring N and E while avoiding positions that are forbidden AND excluding C,R,A.

Strong candidate: **STEIN** (S,T,E,I,N)
- It places E in position 3 (avoiding position 5)
- Places N in position 5 (since position 4 was bad, trying a new spot)
- Tests S,T,I (new letters)
- Avoids C,R,A

Another option: **TOKEN** (T,O,K,E,N) but O and K might be less common.

**STEIN** seems solid:
- Gives chance to confirm positions of E (pos3) and N (pos5). If either lights up as ""✓"", we've nailed them. If ""-"", we know they're elsewhere but still in the word.

Alternatively, **LINES** (L,I,N,E,S) — but N in position 3 (which might be fine), E in 4. Avoids position 4 for N? Yes. Also avoids E in position 5.

But **LINES** ends with S. That might be okay since S is common. However, starting with L tests a less frequent letter? Not crucial—S,T are higher frequency anyway.

Comparing:
**STEIN**: Tests S,T,E,I,N with E in position 3 and N in position 5—new positions for both ruled-out placements.

**LINES**: N in position 3 (new), E in position 4 (also new position for E). This is fairly equivalent too.

I'll select **STEIN** since T and S feel slightly more common than L and I. Plus “stein” is a familiar word.

Therefore, next guess: STEIN

Let me validate:
- Includes N and E
- Avoids C,R,A
- Repositions both (E not in 5th, N not in 4th)
- Tests S,T,I—high-value consonants.

Seems strategically sound.Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (""CRANE"" → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)):  
- **C, R, A** are **completely absent** from the secret word.  
- **N and E** are **present**, but **not in position 4** (for N) or **position 5** (for E).  

For the next guess:  
- Must include **N and E** (with N not in position 4; E not in position 5).  
- Must exclude C, R, A.  
- To maximize information, focus on **high-frequency letters** (e.g., S, T, L, O) and reposition N/E to untested spots.  

I chose **STEIN**:  
- Tests S/T/I (new common letters) while retaining N/E in new positions (E in position 3; N in position 5).  
- Avoids C/R/A entirely.  
- Efficiently probes E/N positions and expands letter coverage.

After reviewing the feedback from the first two guesses:

From Guess 1 (""crane""): 
- C, R, A are absent (x)
- N is present but not in position 4 (-)
- E is present but not in position 5 (-)

From Guess 2 (""stein""):
- S and T are absent (x)
- E is correct and in position 3 (✓)  [since it was the third letter]
- I is absent (x)
- N is present but not in position 5 (-)  [since it was guessed in position 5]

Current deductions:
- **Secret word contains**: E (fixed in position 3) and N (somewhere, but not position 4 or 5). From ""crane"", E was present but not in position 5. Now E is fixed at position 3.

- **Letters confirmed absent**: C, R, A, S, T, I.

- **Position constraints**:
  - Position 3 is E (fixed from ""stein"" feedback).
  - N is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (since it was misplaced there in past guesses).
    - So N must be in position 1 or 2.

Now expanding:
- Secret word pattern: _ _ E _ _ 
- Position 1 or 2 must be N.

We also need additional letters that haven't been tested yet. Letters tested so far: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, I. Absentees: C, R, A, S, T, I.

Remaining letters to test: Common consonants/vowels like B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, possibly others.

We know:
- Word: ? ? E ? ? 
- N is in position 1 or 2.

Given the absence of many common letters, the secret word likely uses less frequent letters. We should prioritize:
- Confirming N's position: try it in position 1 or 2.
- Testing new high-frequency letters: L, O, D, M, etc.

Possible words that fit:
- Structure: N E ? ? ? or ? N E ? ? 

But E is fixed as the third character, so it's actually [letter1] [letter2] E [letter4] [letter5]

And N must be letter1 or letter2.

Case 1: N is in position 1 → N _ E _ _
Case 2: N is in position 2 → _ N E _ _

We need a valid English word satisfying:
- Does not contain C, R, A, S, T, I
- Contains N (in 1 or 2)
- Contains E (in position 3)
- The other letters are unknown.

Possible examples:
For ""N _ E _ _"": Possible words: NEWER? But W is untested. NEWER contains E at position 3? N E W E R → position3 is W, not E? Wait no—""NEWER"" is N E W E R → position 3 is W. So incorrect.

Need position 3 to be E.

Another: NEEDY → N E E D Y → position3 is E? Position3 is E (second E). Okay ""NEEDY"" has N position1, E position2, E position3? But our guess requires position3 to be E—""NEEDY"" has E at position2 and 3. But we know from feedback that E is only confirmed at position3, not whether there's another E.

Actually, ""steine"" had E at position3, and it was marked correct. So position3 must be E, but other E's could exist? Not forbidden yet.

Similarly, ""crane"" had E at position5 marked absent? No feedback: E was misplaced (wrong position) in ""crane""—it was guessed in position5. That doesn't preclude E elsewhere. But in ""stein"", E position3 was ✓, so position3 is definitely E.

Now, looking for words with E in position3 and starting with N or second letter N.

Possible words:
- If position1 is N: N ? E ? ? → e.g., NODES? But S is absent, invalid. Similarly NAKED? A absent.

Avoiding absentees: C,R,A,S,T,I are out.

Options:
- For N in position1: Words like NEEDY → N E E D Y → positions: 1:N, 2:E, 3:E (but E at position3 is fixed—yes), 4:D, 5:Y
  - Does ""NEEDY"" work? Position3 is E—good.
  - Letters: N,E,E,D,Y → we know E is allowed, N is in, D and Y untested, and note the double-E. Can we have multiple E's? The feedback from ""stein"" about E didn't specify if it's the only E—it just marked position3 as correct and didn't comment on other positions.
  - However, ""NEEDY"" contains E at position2 as well—but position2 is not yet confirmed. So possible—no contradiction.
  - Also, absent letters: avoiding C,R,A,S,T,I—yes.
- Alternatively, NEIGH → N E I G H → I is absent! Forbidden.
- NOMEN: Too obscure, and O,E,M,N → O and M untested.

For position2 is N: _ N E _ _

Words like SNORE? S absent—invalid.
MONEY → M O N E Y → Position2:N (yes), position3:E? Position3 is N—wait: ""MONEY"" letters: M O N E Y → positions:1:M, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:Y → but we have position3 must be E, not N. Incorrect.

Correct pattern: position3 is E.

So ""MONEY"" is M O N E Y → position3=N, not E. Wrong.

Another try: word like ""HONEY"" — H O N E Y → position1:H, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E → position3 is N—not E.

I need something like _ N E _ _ → so character2=N, character3=E.

Examples: INEPT? I absent—invalid.
ONCER? O absent? No, O present? Let's list words: AGNES? A absent. So avoiding absentees.

Possible words:
- **UNMET**: U N M E T → positions:1:U, position2:N, position3:M? Position3 is M—not E. Wrong.
Structure must be letter1, then N at position2, then E at position3.

So: ? N E ? ?

Valid words: 
- **ANKER**: A absent—invalid.
- But avoiding C,R,A,S,T,I—so consider letters like O, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

**BUNCH**: B U N C H → position2=N? Positions:1:B, 2:U, 3:N—not E. Wrong.

Need position3=E specifically.

So "" ? N E ? ?"" meaning:
Position1: some letter (call it X)
Position2: N
Position3: E
Position4: Y
Position5: Z

So word = [X] N E [Y] [Z]

Valid example: **ANGUS** — But G and U present? A is absent? ANGUS has A—invalid.

Another: **INKER** — I absent.

**OUNCE** — O U N C E → position1:O, 2:U, 3:N—not E.

I'm struggling. Look for English words ending with ""ENE"" or something? But position3=E, so not ending.

Common words: like ""BYNTE"" not a word.

Perhaps **LINED** — L I N E D → position3=N? Position sequence: L,I,N,E,D → position3=N, position4=E. But we need position3=E. So no.

Another thought: what about ""QUEEN"" — Q U E E N → position3=E—yes! Letters: Q,U,E,E,N. Position3=E—good. But Q? And E at position4 also.

""QUEEN"" — positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E (good), 4:E, 5:N. Now, letters: Q,U,E,E,N.

Absentees: no C,R,A,S,T,I—Q and U are untested. Valid? Q is less common but legitimate.

Alternatives: **GIVEN** — G I V E N → position3=V? Positions: G,I,V,E,N → position3=V, not E.

Need position3=E.

**HAVEN** — H A V E N → position4=E? Positions: H,A,V,E,N → position4=E. Not.

Must have pattern: either N in position1 with E at 3: like NEEDY, NEEFL? Not, NEEDY as above (NEEDY: N,E,E,D,Y → position3=E).

Other words with N position1 and E position3: 
- **NEWEL**: N E W E L → position3=W? Positions: N,E,W,E,L → position2=E, position3=W—not E. Wrong unless second letter is E? No.

NE?E? words: like NEARS? S absent and A absent.

Focusing: for ""N _ E _ _"": 
NEEDS: S absent.
NEIGH: I absent.
NERDS: R absent.
NEXUS: X not tested, but S absent? S banned.

With avoiding S and others: NEPER? E P E R → R absent.

Not many common ones. 

Perhaps N position2: word pattern ? N E ? ?

Like ""PUNCH"": P U N C H → position3=N? Not E.

Position3=E: so sequence after N must be E in the third position.

Possible words: 
- KNEEP: K N E E P → positions: K,N,E,E,P → position3=E—yes. Letters: K,N,E,E,P. Avoids absentees? C,R,A,S,T,I absent? Yes, K,N,E,E,P — N and E confirmed, K and P new.

Valid word? ""KNEEP"" might not be common—check dictionary? Assuming Wordle accepts variant, but let's see alternatives.

**LYNED**: Not common.

**OWNED**: O W N E D → positions: O,W,N,E,D → position3=N? Position sequence: position1:O,2:W,3:N,position4=E—not E at 3.

**UNTIE**: U N T I E → position5=E? Position sequence: U,N,T,I,E → positions:1:U,2:N,3:T,4:I,5:E—position3=T, not E. And T and I absent—invalid.

Another idea: **UNWED**: U N W E D → position4=E? Positions: U,N,W,E,D → position3=W, position4=E—not E at 3.

Correcting: to satisfy position3=E, possible word? 

Examples like ""ANODE"" — A absent.

""INNER""—I absent.

""ENEMY""—E position1, N position2, E position3—yes: E N E M Y → avoiding absentees? Letters: E,N,E,M,Y—no C,R,A,S,T,I? OK. But is E position1 allowed? We don't know yet. Constraints only on N and E positions, not prohibiting E elsewhere.

So ""ENEMY"": positions:1:E, 2:N, 3:E, 4:M, 5:Y—position3=E—good. Also N at position2—so N is not in positions 4 or 5, which matches.

Similarly, ""MINED""—I absent—invalid.

So ""ENEMY"" seems valid: 
- E at position1 — untested? Could be present or not.
- N at position2 — we know N must be somewhere, here position2—possible.
- E at position3 — fixed ✓.
- M and Y new.

If ""ENEMY"" is the word, but we need to confirm.

Another word: **ONCER**—O N C E R: C and R absent—invalid.

Back to Case 1: N position1: e.g., NEEDY.

From feedback, ""stein"" had E at position3 correct and N present but not position5.

In NEEDY: N position1, E position2 and 3, etc.

Could be.

But ENEMY has N position2.

To maximize information:
- Guess NEEDY to test N in position1 and double-E possibility.
- Or ENEMY to test N in position2 and new letters.

But we have only 6 tries, so need efficient.

Since E is fixed at position3, and N must be in 1 or 2, I can choose a word that:
- Places N in position 1 (to test Case 1)
- Or position2 (Case 2)

If I place N in position1, and if it's position1 is ✓ in reality, I get info.

Similarly for position2.

Either way, I'll cover.

Choose common letters: L, O, K, etc.

Option: **NEVER**—E and R? R absent—invalid.

**LEVEL**—L,E,V,E,L → position1:L,2:E,3:V—position3=V? Not E—unless.

Must be E at position3.

Another: **BELIE**—B E L I E → position3=L? Not E.

Difficult to find words.

**OUNCE**—not.

Or **BEVEL**—B E V E L, position3=V? Not E.

Perhaps uncommon words? Wordle usually uses common words.

List: 
For pattern ""? N E ? ?"": 
- **ANGEL**: A absent—no
- **ENGED**? Not a word.
- **INKED**—I absent.
- **OKNED**? No.

Better to think of common words.

**LONGE**: L O N G E → positions: L,O,N,G,E → position3=N, not E—unless: word ""Longe"" not common.

Alternate: **HONEY** — position3=N, not E.

Perhaps ""CHIEF"" not, position varies.

Another try: position3=E, position2=N → words ending with N E? But not.

So possible words: ""DIENED"" not 5 letters.

Accept that double-E might be possible? Or other.

""NEEDS"": S absent—invalid.

""NEIGH"": I absent.

So rare with avoided letters.

Perhaps N position1: pattern N ? E ? ? 

Examples: NEEDS — invalid.
NERVED: R absent.
NUKED: U,K,E,D — N at1, E at3: N U K E D → positions: N,U,K,E,D — position3=K, position4=E? Not E at3—position3 must be K? Wrong.

Except if second letter allows E? Like NE E something.

Specifically N E E ? ? → NEED? But D — possible, NEED is 5-letter? Need is 4? NEEDY as I thought.

NEEDY is valid: N E E D Y -> positions:1:N,2:E,3:E,4:D,5:Y

Yes, NEEDY is a valid word: lacking in money; poor.

Similarly, NEWER: N E W E R -> positions:1:N,2:E,3:W,4:E—position3=W not E. Invalid for position3.

So NEEDY works for pattern: position1:N, position2:E, position3:E, etc. Position3 is E—good. Also contains E at position2.

Now, we haven't ruled out multiple E's, so it's possible.

Next option: ENEMY (E N E M Y).

Both are plausible.

To choose between NEEDY and ENEMY.

NEEDY tests N in position1.
ENEMY tests N in position2.

Also, NEEDY has D and Y, ENEMY has M and Y.

Since both contain E at position2—in NEEDY position2=E and ENEMY position1=E—but position1=E is not confirmed.

For information:
If I guess ENEMY, and if N is indeed in position2, then I might get ✓ for N position2. If not, it might be marked - or X—but we know N is present.

Similarly for NEEDY: position1=N, which is a possible location.

Given that S is absent, T absent, etc. Prioritize testing N position.

I could guess a word with N in position1 and new letters.

Or since ENEMY also tests position1=E, which wasn't tested before.

ENEMY has advantages: tests E at position1 (possible), N at position2 (possible).

Whereas NEEDY has E at position2 again—but if secret has only one E, it might be weird, but possible.

Both work.

Choose ENEMY? Or for new letters like O.

Other possibilities: **BEIGY** — not, position vary.

**GUESSED** not.

Decide on ENEMY.

But let's see feedback implied: in ""crane"", E was marked - meaning present but not position5. Now with E at position3 fixed.

Guess: ENEMY

If secret is ENEMY, feedback: E at position1? Unknown, N position2? Could be -, E position3 ✓, M position4? Unknown, Y position5 unknown.

Similarly, if NEEDY, N position1 possible.

But ENEMY also tests M and Y—useful.

Another option: **OPENS** — contains S absent—no.

**YANKS** — A absent.

I am considering **KENDO** — K E N D O → position3=N, not E—invalid.

So back. 

Another word: **BEGIN** — G I N — positions: B,E,G,I,N → position2=E, position3=G—not E.

Must have E at position3.

Perhaps ""THREE"" — T H R E E → R absent and position4=E.

Not.

I think ENEMY is acceptable.

Or NEEDY.

But to test more common letters: NEEDY uses D and Y, ENEMY uses M and Y.

M is less common than L, O? Probably fine.

Going with ENEMY, as it positions N at2—untested spot.

Similarly, we haven't tested position1 at all—in both guesses, position1 was C then S, both absent.

Position1 could be many things.

So ENEMY is a valid guess.

Therefore, next guess: ENEMY

Check constraints:
- Position3:E ✓
- N must be present, not in position4 or5—here position2, good.
- Excluded letters: C,R,A,S,T,I—none in ENEMY.

### Deductive Reasoning Steps:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:  
   - Guess 1 (""crane""): C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)  
     - Letters `C`, `R`, `A` are **absent** from the secret word.  
     - `N` is present but **not in position 4**.  
     - `E` is present but **not in position 5**.  
   - Guess 2 (""stein""): S(x), T(x), E(✓), I(x), N(-)  
     - Letters `S`, `T`, `I` are **absent**.  
     - `E` is confirmed in **position 3** (correct placement).  
     - `N` is present but **not in position 5**.  

2. **Confirm Known Letters**:  
   - `E` is fixed at **position 3** of the secret word.  
   - `N` is present but excluded from positions 4 and 5 (from Guess 1 and Guess 2 feedback). Thus, `N` must be in **position 1 or 2**.  
   - Absent letters: `C`, `R`, `A`, `S`, `T`, `I` cannot appear.  

3. **Deduce Word Pattern**:  
   - Secret pattern: `[position1] [position2] E [position4] [position5]`.  
   - Position 1 or 2 must be `N`.  
   - Untested positions: 1, 2, 4, and 5 need new letters.  

4. **Prioritize Next Guess Goals**:  
   - Test `N`'s position (1 or 2) and cover new high-frequency letters.  
   - Use only untested letters: Avoid `C,R,A,S,T,I`; prioritize common consonants/vowels like `M`, `Y`, `L`, `O`, `D`, `H`.  
   - Reposition `N` to an untested spot (either position 1 or 2) while keeping `E` fixed at position 3.  

5. **Candidate Words**:  
   - **Option 1: `N` in position 1** (e.g., `NEEDY`).  
     - Pattern: `N E E D Y`. Tests position 1 for `N` and new letters `D`, `Y`. Double `E` possible.  
     - Concerns: `E` at position 2 may conflict if no duplicate `E`, but feedback hasn't ruled this out.  
   - **Option 2: `N` in position 2** (e.g., `ENEMY`).  
     - Pattern: `E N E M Y`. Tests position 2 for `N`, position 1 for `E` (possible duplication), and new letters `M`, `Y`.  
   - Final choice: `ENEMY` is stronger:  
     - Tests `N` position 2 (untested location).  
     - Efficiently probes multiple constraints: `N` displacement, `E` duplication (positions 1 and 3), and uses common letters (`M`, `Y`).  
     - Avoids all excluded letters.  

6. **Word Validity**:  
   - `ENEMY` is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning ""hostile entity"" or adversary).

<guess>enemy</guess>",enemy,"After reviewing the feedback from the first two guesses:

From Guess 1 (""crane""): 
- C, R, A are absent (x)
- N is present but not in position 4 (-)
- E is present but not in position 5 (-)

From Guess 2 (""stein""):
- S and T are absent (x)
- E is correct and in position 3 (✓)  [since it was the third letter]
- I is absent (x)
- N is present but not in position 5 (-)  [since it was guessed in position 5]

Current deductions:
- **Secret word contains**: E (fixed in position 3) and N (somewhere, but not position 4 or 5). From ""crane"", E was present but not in position 5. Now E is fixed at position 3.

- **Letters confirmed absent**: C, R, A, S, T, I.

- **Position constraints**:
  - Position 3 is E (fixed from ""stein"" feedback).
  - N is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (since it was misplaced there in past guesses).
    - So N must be in position 1 or 2.

Now expanding:
- Secret word pattern: _ _ E _ _ 
- Position 1 or 2 must be N.

We also need additional letters that haven't been tested yet. Letters tested so far: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, I. Absentees: C, R, A, S, T, I.

Remaining letters to test: Common consonants/vowels like B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, possibly others.

We know:
- Word: ? ? E ? ? 
- N is in position 1 or 2.

Given the absence of many common letters, the secret word likely uses less frequent letters. We should prioritize:
- Confirming N's position: try it in position 1 or 2.
- Testing new high-frequency letters: L, O, D, M, etc.

Possible words that fit:
- Structure: N E ? ? ? or ? N E ? ? 

But E is fixed as the third character, so it's actually [letter1] [letter2] E [letter4] [letter5]

And N must be letter1 or letter2.

Case 1: N is in position 1 → N _ E _ _
Case 2: N is in position 2 → _ N E _ _

We need a valid English word satisfying:
- Does not contain C, R, A, S, T, I
- Contains N (in 1 or 2)
- Contains E (in position 3)
- The other letters are unknown.

Possible examples:
For ""N _ E _ _"": Possible words: NEWER? But W is untested. NEWER contains E at position 3? N E W E R → position3 is W, not E? Wait no—""NEWER"" is N E W E R → position 3 is W. So incorrect.

Need position 3 to be E.

Another: NEEDY → N E E D Y → position3 is E? Position3 is E (second E). Okay ""NEEDY"" has N position1, E position2, E position3? But our guess requires position3 to be E—""NEEDY"" has E at position2 and 3. But we know from feedback that E is only confirmed at position3, not whether there's another E.

Actually, ""steine"" had E at position3, and it was marked correct. So position3 must be E, but other E's could exist? Not forbidden yet.

Similarly, ""crane"" had E at position5 marked absent? No feedback: E was misplaced (wrong position) in ""crane""—it was guessed in position5. That doesn't preclude E elsewhere. But in ""stein"", E position3 was ✓, so position3 is definitely E.

Now, looking for words with E in position3 and starting with N or second letter N.

Possible words:
- If position1 is N: N ? E ? ? → e.g., NODES? But S is absent, invalid. Similarly NAKED? A absent.

Avoiding absentees: C,R,A,S,T,I are out.

Options:
- For N in position1: Words like NEEDY → N E E D Y → positions: 1:N, 2:E, 3:E (but E at position3 is fixed—yes), 4:D, 5:Y
  - Does ""NEEDY"" work? Position3 is E—good.
  - Letters: N,E,E,D,Y → we know E is allowed, N is in, D and Y untested, and note the double-E. Can we have multiple E's? The feedback from ""stein"" about E didn't specify if it's the only E—it just marked position3 as correct and didn't comment on other positions.
  - However, ""NEEDY"" contains E at position2 as well—but position2 is not yet confirmed. So possible—no contradiction.
  - Also, absent letters: avoiding C,R,A,S,T,I—yes.
- Alternatively, NEIGH → N E I G H → I is absent! Forbidden.
- NOMEN: Too obscure, and O,E,M,N → O and M untested.

For position2 is N: _ N E _ _

Words like SNORE? S absent—invalid.
MONEY → M O N E Y → Position2:N (yes), position3:E? Position3 is N—wait: ""MONEY"" letters: M O N E Y → positions:1:M, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:Y → but we have position3 must be E, not N. Incorrect.

Correct pattern: position3 is E.

So ""MONEY"" is M O N E Y → position3=N, not E. Wrong.

Another try: word like ""HONEY"" — H O N E Y → position1:H, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E → position3 is N—not E.

I need something like _ N E _ _ → so character2=N, character3=E.

Examples: INEPT? I absent—invalid.
ONCER? O absent? No, O present? Let's list words: AGNES? A absent. So avoiding absentees.

Possible words:
- **UNMET**: U N M E T → positions:1:U, position2:N, position3:M? Position3 is M—not E. Wrong.
Structure must be letter1, then N at position2, then E at position3.

So: ? N E ? ?

Valid words: 
- **ANKER**: A absent—invalid.
- But avoiding C,R,A,S,T,I—so consider letters like O, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

**BUNCH**: B U N C H → position2=N? Positions:1:B, 2:U, 3:N—not E. Wrong.

Need position3=E specifically.

So "" ? N E ? ?"" meaning:
Position1: some letter (call it X)
Position2: N
Position3: E
Position4: Y
Position5: Z

So word = [X] N E [Y] [Z]

Valid example: **ANGUS** — But G and U present? A is absent? ANGUS has A—invalid.

Another: **INKER** — I absent.

**OUNCE** — O U N C E → position1:O, 2:U, 3:N—not E.

I'm struggling. Look for English words ending with ""ENE"" or something? But position3=E, so not ending.

Common words: like ""BYNTE"" not a word.

Perhaps **LINED** — L I N E D → position3=N? Position sequence: L,I,N,E,D → position3=N, position4=E. But we need position3=E. So no.

Another thought: what about ""QUEEN"" — Q U E E N → position3=E—yes! Letters: Q,U,E,E,N. Position3=E—good. But Q? And E at position4 also.

""QUEEN"" — positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E (good), 4:E, 5:N. Now, letters: Q,U,E,E,N.

Absentees: no C,R,A,S,T,I—Q and U are untested. Valid? Q is less common but legitimate.

Alternatives: **GIVEN** — G I V E N → position3=V? Positions: G,I,V,E,N → position3=V, not E.

Need position3=E.

**HAVEN** — H A V E N → position4=E? Positions: H,A,V,E,N → position4=E. Not.

Must have pattern: either N in position1 with E at 3: like NEEDY, NEEFL? Not, NEEDY as above (NEEDY: N,E,E,D,Y → position3=E).

Other words with N position1 and E position3: 
- **NEWEL**: N E W E L → position3=W? Positions: N,E,W,E,L → position2=E, position3=W—not E. Wrong unless second letter is E? No.

NE?E? words: like NEARS? S absent and A absent.

Focusing: for ""N _ E _ _"": 
NEEDS: S absent.
NEIGH: I absent.
NERDS: R absent.
NEXUS: X not tested, but S absent? S banned.

With avoiding S and others: NEPER? E P E R → R absent.

Not many common ones. 

Perhaps N position2: word pattern ? N E ? ?

Like ""PUNCH"": P U N C H → position3=N? Not E.

Position3=E: so sequence after N must be E in the third position.

Possible words: 
- KNEEP: K N E E P → positions: K,N,E,E,P → position3=E—yes. Letters: K,N,E,E,P. Avoids absentees? C,R,A,S,T,I absent? Yes, K,N,E,E,P — N and E confirmed, K and P new.

Valid word? ""KNEEP"" might not be common—check dictionary? Assuming Wordle accepts variant, but let's see alternatives.

**LYNED**: Not common.

**OWNED**: O W N E D → positions: O,W,N,E,D → position3=N? Position sequence: position1:O,2:W,3:N,position4=E—not E at 3.

**UNTIE**: U N T I E → position5=E? Position sequence: U,N,T,I,E → positions:1:U,2:N,3:T,4:I,5:E—position3=T, not E. And T and I absent—invalid.

Another idea: **UNWED**: U N W E D → position4=E? Positions: U,N,W,E,D → position3=W, position4=E—not E at 3.

Correcting: to satisfy position3=E, possible word? 

Examples like ""ANODE"" — A absent.

""INNER""—I absent.

""ENEMY""—E position1, N position2, E position3—yes: E N E M Y → avoiding absentees? Letters: E,N,E,M,Y—no C,R,A,S,T,I? OK. But is E position1 allowed? We don't know yet. Constraints only on N and E positions, not prohibiting E elsewhere.

So ""ENEMY"": positions:1:E, 2:N, 3:E, 4:M, 5:Y—position3=E—good. Also N at position2—so N is not in positions 4 or 5, which matches.

Similarly, ""MINED""—I absent—invalid.

So ""ENEMY"" seems valid: 
- E at position1 — untested? Could be present or not.
- N at position2 — we know N must be somewhere, here position2—possible.
- E at position3 — fixed ✓.
- M and Y new.

If ""ENEMY"" is the word, but we need to confirm.

Another word: **ONCER**—O N C E R: C and R absent—invalid.

Back to Case 1: N position1: e.g., NEEDY.

From feedback, ""stein"" had E at position3 correct and N present but not position5.

In NEEDY: N position1, E position2 and 3, etc.

Could be.

But ENEMY has N position2.

To maximize information:
- Guess NEEDY to test N in position1 and double-E possibility.
- Or ENEMY to test N in position2 and new letters.

But we have only 6 tries, so need efficient.

Since E is fixed at position3, and N must be in 1 or 2, I can choose a word that:
- Places N in position 1 (to test Case 1)
- Or position2 (Case 2)

If I place N in position1, and if it's position1 is ✓ in reality, I get info.

Similarly for position2.

Either way, I'll cover.

Choose common letters: L, O, K, etc.

Option: **NEVER**—E and R? R absent—invalid.

**LEVEL**—L,E,V,E,L → position1:L,2:E,3:V—position3=V? Not E—unless.

Must be E at position3.

Another: **BELIE**—B E L I E → position3=L? Not E.

Difficult to find words.

**OUNCE**—not.

Or **BEVEL**—B E V E L, position3=V? Not E.

Perhaps uncommon words? Wordle usually uses common words.

List: 
For pattern ""? N E ? ?"": 
- **ANGEL**: A absent—no
- **ENGED**? Not a word.
- **INKED**—I absent.
- **OKNED**? No.

Better to think of common words.

**LONGE**: L O N G E → positions: L,O,N,G,E → position3=N, not E—unless: word ""Longe"" not common.

Alternate: **HONEY** — position3=N, not E.

Perhaps ""CHIEF"" not, position varies.

Another try: position3=E, position2=N → words ending with N E? But not.

So possible words: ""DIENED"" not 5 letters.

Accept that double-E might be possible? Or other.

""NEEDS"": S absent—invalid.

""NEIGH"": I absent.

So rare with avoided letters.

Perhaps N position1: pattern N ? E ? ? 

Examples: NEEDS — invalid.
NERVED: R absent.
NUKED: U,K,E,D — N at1, E at3: N U K E D → positions: N,U,K,E,D — position3=K, position4=E? Not E at3—position3 must be K? Wrong.

Except if second letter allows E? Like NE E something.

Specifically N E E ? ? → NEED? But D — possible, NEED is 5-letter? Need is 4? NEEDY as I thought.

NEEDY is valid: N E E D Y -> positions:1:N,2:E,3:E,4:D,5:Y

Yes, NEEDY is a valid word: lacking in money; poor.

Similarly, NEWER: N E W E R -> positions:1:N,2:E,3:W,4:E—position3=W not E. Invalid for position3.

So NEEDY works for pattern: position1:N, position2:E, position3:E, etc. Position3 is E—good. Also contains E at position2.

Now, we haven't ruled out multiple E's, so it's possible.

Next option: ENEMY (E N E M Y).

Both are plausible.

To choose between NEEDY and ENEMY.

NEEDY tests N in position1.
ENEMY tests N in position2.

Also, NEEDY has D and Y, ENEMY has M and Y.

Since both contain E at position2—in NEEDY position2=E and ENEMY position1=E—but position1=E is not confirmed.

For information:
If I guess ENEMY, and if N is indeed in position2, then I might get ✓ for N position2. If not, it might be marked - or X—but we know N is present.

Similarly for NEEDY: position1=N, which is a possible location.

Given that S is absent, T absent, etc. Prioritize testing N position.

I could guess a word with N in position1 and new letters.

Or since ENEMY also tests position1=E, which wasn't tested before.

ENEMY has advantages: tests E at position1 (possible), N at position2 (possible).

Whereas NEEDY has E at position2 again—but if secret has only one E, it might be weird, but possible.

Both work.

Choose ENEMY? Or for new letters like O.

Other possibilities: **BEIGY** — not, position vary.

**GUESSED** not.

Decide on ENEMY.

But let's see feedback implied: in ""crane"", E was marked - meaning present but not position5. Now with E at position3 fixed.

Guess: ENEMY

If secret is ENEMY, feedback: E at position1? Unknown, N position2? Could be -, E position3 ✓, M position4? Unknown, Y position5 unknown.

Similarly, if NEEDY, N position1 possible.

But ENEMY also tests M and Y—useful.

Another option: **OPENS** — contains S absent—no.

**YANKS** — A absent.

I am considering **KENDO** — K E N D O → position3=N, not E—invalid.

So back. 

Another word: **BEGIN** — G I N — positions: B,E,G,I,N → position2=E, position3=G—not E.

Must have E at position3.

Perhaps ""THREE"" — T H R E E → R absent and position4=E.

Not.

I think ENEMY is acceptable.

Or NEEDY.

But to test more common letters: NEEDY uses D and Y, ENEMY uses M and Y.

M is less common than L, O? Probably fine.

Going with ENEMY, as it positions N at2—untested spot.

Similarly, we haven't tested position1 at all—in both guesses, position1 was C then S, both absent.

Position1 could be many things.

So ENEMY is a valid guess.

Therefore, next guess: ENEMY

Check constraints:
- Position3:E ✓
- N must be present, not in position4 or5—here position2, good.
- Excluded letters: C,R,A,S,T,I—none in ENEMY.### Deductive Reasoning Steps:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Hmm, the user is asking me to make my first 5-letter word guess in the Wordle-like game. Since it's the first guess, I need to choose a word strategically to maximize information gathering.  

The most effective opening words usually contain common letters and a balanced vowel-consonant distribution. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROATE"" are popular among players because they cover frequent letters (R, S, T, L, E) and vowels (A, E, O).  

Testing vowel distribution might be wise since vowels are critical in English words. A word with multiple vowels could quickly narrow down possibilities. Let me consider ""ADIEU"" – it covers four vowels (A, E, I, U) but lacks consonant coverage. Alternatively, ""CRANE"" feels better: it has two vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N), plus it's from the original Wordle solutions list.  

""SOARE"" is another strong contender (birds are common in Wordle), but I recall the user's rules don't specify using only solution words – just valid English words. Still, ""CRANE"" seems safer.  

Final choice: ""CRANE"" gives me ✓/- feedback for C, R, A, N, E positions while covering statistically useful letters. It's a textbook opener.  

Now, to respond: I'll start with reasoning in `<thinking>` (though hidden per format), then output `<guess>crane</guess>`.Based on Wordle strategy principles, an effective first guess should:  
1. Include a mix of common vowels (e.g., A, E) and consonants (e.g., R, S, T, N),  
2. Avoid repeating letters to maximize coverage.  

The word **CRANE** is a strong opener because it:  
- Contains 3 common consonants (C, R, N) and 2 vowels (A, E),  
- Tests letters frequently appearing in 5-letter words,  
- Provides early positioning clues for versatile letters like R.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let me process the feedback from the first guess. I guessed ""CRANE"" and got quite a lot of information from it:

- C, R, A are all marked as ""x"", meaning none of these letters appear in the secret word at all. That immediately eliminates a big chunk of possibilities.
- N and E are marked as ""-"", so both N and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions I guessed them in.

Breaking this down:

1. **Letters to exclude:** C, R, A are completely out. That's significant because R and A are very common letters. The secret word must avoid these entirely.
2. **Letters to include:** Both N and E must be in the word somewhere, but:
   - N is not in the 4th position (since I guessed it there and it's wrong position).
   - E is not in the 5th position (since I guessed it there and it's wrong position).

So the secret word:
- Contains N and E
- Excludes C, R, A
- Is 5 letters long

Now, I need a new guess that incorporates these constraints:
- Must include N and E (but not in positions 4 or 5 respectively)
- Must exclude C, R, A
- Should test new letters to gather more information

Since N and E are confirmed in the word, I'll prioritize keeping them in my next guess but in different positions to test their real locations. I'll also introduce new common letters since C/R/A are out—good candidates would be T, O, S, L, M, etc.

Possible approach:
1. **Reposition N:** Since N wasn't in position 4, I could try it in position 2, 3, or 5.
2. **Reposition E:** Since E wasn't in position 5, I could move it to position 1, 2, or 3.
3. **New letters:** Test other common letters like T, O, S, L, etc.

I should avoid positions where we already ruled them out, though:

- Since N was eliminated from position 4, I can place it in 1,2,3, or 5, but caution: position 5 was originally E's spot which might conflict if I put N there. Similarly, E can't be in position 5 so I have to avoid that placement.

Given E is highly likely to be somewhere in positions 1-4, and N cannot be in position 4.

Good second guesses should maximize information:
- Keep N and E to verify their positions
- Use fresh high-frequency letters: S, T, L, O, M, D, etc.

Considering possible words that fit:
- Must include N and E
- Exclude C, R, A

For example:
- Words like **STONE**, **STEIN**, **LEMON**, **MEANT**, **SPINE**
  
Now evaluating each:
- **STONE**: S T O N E → Tests S,T,O (new), keeps N/E but moves them (N to position 4 was bad, but I'm trying position 4 again? Wait, the feedback said N was present but not in position 4—so placing it in position 4 again is useless. I should move N to a new spot to test its real location.)
  
Better alternatives where N and E shift positions:
- **MEANT**: M E A N T → But A is excluded! Invalid, since A is ruled out.
- **SPINE**: S P I N E → This is better. Places E in position 5? But E cannot be in position 5 per feedback. So invalid placement.
  
Ah, constraint: E cannot be in position 5. So any candidate must place E in positions 1-4 and N not in position 4.

Good options:
- **N** can be in positions 1,2,3,5
- **E** can be in 1,2,3,4
  
Look for words featuring N and E while avoiding positions that are forbidden AND excluding C,R,A.

Strong candidate: **STEIN** (S,T,E,I,N)
- It places E in position 3 (avoiding position 5)
- Places N in position 5 (since position 4 was bad, trying a new spot)
- Tests S,T,I (new letters)
- Avoids C,R,A

Another option: **TOKEN** (T,O,K,E,N) but O and K might be less common.

**STEIN** seems solid:
- Gives chance to confirm positions of E (pos3) and N (pos5). If either lights up as ""✓"", we've nailed them. If ""-"", we know they're elsewhere but still in the word.

Alternatively, **LINES** (L,I,N,E,S) — but N in position 3 (which might be fine), E in 4. Avoids position 4 for N? Yes. Also avoids E in position 5.

But **LINES** ends with S. That might be okay since S is common. However, starting with L tests a less frequent letter? Not crucial—S,T are higher frequency anyway.

Comparing:
**STEIN**: Tests S,T,E,I,N with E in position 3 and N in position 5—new positions for both ruled-out placements.

**LINES**: N in position 3 (new), E in position 4 (also new position for E). This is fairly equivalent too.

I'll select **STEIN** since T and S feel slightly more common than L and I. Plus “stein” is a familiar word.

Therefore, next guess: STEIN

Let me validate:
- Includes N and E
- Avoids C,R,A
- Repositions both (E not in 5th, N not in 4th)
- Tests S,T,I—high-value consonants.

Seems strategically sound.Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (""CRANE"" → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)):  
- **C, R, A** are **completely absent** from the secret word.  
- **N and E** are **present**, but **not in position 4** (for N) or **position 5** (for E).  

For the next guess:  
- Must include **N and E** (with N not in position 4; E not in position 5).  
- Must exclude C, R, A.  
- To maximize information, focus on **high-frequency letters** (e.g., S, T, L, O) and reposition N/E to untested spots.  

I chose **STEIN**:  
- Tests S/T/I (new common letters) while retaining N/E in new positions (E in position 3; N in position 5).  
- Avoids C/R/A entirely.  
- Efficiently probes E/N positions and expands letter coverage.

<guess>stein</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(✓) I(x) N(-)
<｜Assistant｜>After reviewing the feedback from the first two guesses:

From Guess 1 (""crane""): 
- C, R, A are absent (x)
- N is present but not in position 4 (-)
- E is present but not in position 5 (-)

From Guess 2 (""stein""):
- S and T are absent (x)
- E is correct and in position 3 (✓)  [since it was the third letter]
- I is absent (x)
- N is present but not in position 5 (-)  [since it was guessed in position 5]

Current deductions:
- **Secret word contains**: E (fixed in position 3) and N (somewhere, but not position 4 or 5). From ""crane"", E was present but not in position 5. Now E is fixed at position 3.

- **Letters confirmed absent**: C, R, A, S, T, I.

- **Position constraints**:
  - Position 3 is E (fixed from ""stein"" feedback).
  - N is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (since it was misplaced there in past guesses).
    - So N must be in position 1 or 2.

Now expanding:
- Secret word pattern: _ _ E _ _ 
- Position 1 or 2 must be N.

We also need additional letters that haven't been tested yet. Letters tested so far: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, I. Absentees: C, R, A, S, T, I.

Remaining letters to test: Common consonants/vowels like B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, possibly others.

We know:
- Word: ? ? E ? ? 
- N is in position 1 or 2.

Given the absence of many common letters, the secret word likely uses less frequent letters. We should prioritize:
- Confirming N's position: try it in position 1 or 2.
- Testing new high-frequency letters: L, O, D, M, etc.

Possible words that fit:
- Structure: N E ? ? ? or ? N E ? ? 

But E is fixed as the third character, so it's actually [letter1] [letter2] E [letter4] [letter5]

And N must be letter1 or letter2.

Case 1: N is in position 1 → N _ E _ _
Case 2: N is in position 2 → _ N E _ _

We need a valid English word satisfying:
- Does not contain C, R, A, S, T, I
- Contains N (in 1 or 2)
- Contains E (in position 3)
- The other letters are unknown.

Possible examples:
For ""N _ E _ _"": Possible words: NEWER? But W is untested. NEWER contains E at position 3? N E W E R → position3 is W, not E? Wait no—""NEWER"" is N E W E R → position 3 is W. So incorrect.

Need position 3 to be E.

Another: NEEDY → N E E D Y → position3 is E? Position3 is E (second E). Okay ""NEEDY"" has N position1, E position2, E position3? But our guess requires position3 to be E—""NEEDY"" has E at position2 and 3. But we know from feedback that E is only confirmed at position3, not whether there's another E.

Actually, ""steine"" had E at position3, and it was marked correct. So position3 must be E, but other E's could exist? Not forbidden yet.

Similarly, ""crane"" had E at position5 marked absent? No feedback: E was misplaced (wrong position) in ""crane""—it was guessed in position5. That doesn't preclude E elsewhere. But in ""stein"", E position3 was ✓, so position3 is definitely E.

Now, looking for words with E in position3 and starting with N or second letter N.

Possible words:
- If position1 is N: N ? E ? ? → e.g., NODES? But S is absent, invalid. Similarly NAKED? A absent.

Avoiding absentees: C,R,A,S,T,I are out.

Options:
- For N in position1: Words like NEEDY → N E E D Y → positions: 1:N, 2:E, 3:E (but E at position3 is fixed—yes), 4:D, 5:Y
  - Does ""NEEDY"" work? Position3 is E—good.
  - Letters: N,E,E,D,Y → we know E is allowed, N is in, D and Y untested, and note the double-E. Can we have multiple E's? The feedback from ""stein"" about E didn't specify if it's the only E—it just marked position3 as correct and didn't comment on other positions.
  - However, ""NEEDY"" contains E at position2 as well—but position2 is not yet confirmed. So possible—no contradiction.
  - Also, absent letters: avoiding C,R,A,S,T,I—yes.
- Alternatively, NEIGH → N E I G H → I is absent! Forbidden.
- NOMEN: Too obscure, and O,E,M,N → O and M untested.

For position2 is N: _ N E _ _

Words like SNORE? S absent—invalid.
MONEY → M O N E Y → Position2:N (yes), position3:E? Position3 is N—wait: ""MONEY"" letters: M O N E Y → positions:1:M, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:Y → but we have position3 must be E, not N. Incorrect.

Correct pattern: position3 is E.

So ""MONEY"" is M O N E Y → position3=N, not E. Wrong.

Another try: word like ""HONEY"" — H O N E Y → position1:H, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E → position3 is N—not E.

I need something like _ N E _ _ → so character2=N, character3=E.

Examples: INEPT? I absent—invalid.
ONCER? O absent? No, O present? Let's list words: AGNES? A absent. So avoiding absentees.

Possible words:
- **UNMET**: U N M E T → positions:1:U, position2:N, position3:M? Position3 is M—not E. Wrong.
Structure must be letter1, then N at position2, then E at position3.

So: ? N E ? ?

Valid words: 
- **ANKER**: A absent—invalid.
- But avoiding C,R,A,S,T,I—so consider letters like O, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

**BUNCH**: B U N C H → position2=N? Positions:1:B, 2:U, 3:N—not E. Wrong.

Need position3=E specifically.

So "" ? N E ? ?"" meaning:
Position1: some letter (call it X)
Position2: N
Position3: E
Position4: Y
Position5: Z

So word = [X] N E [Y] [Z]

Valid example: **ANGUS** — But G and U present? A is absent? ANGUS has A—invalid.

Another: **INKER** — I absent.

**OUNCE** — O U N C E → position1:O, 2:U, 3:N—not E.

I'm struggling. Look for English words ending with ""ENE"" or something? But position3=E, so not ending.

Common words: like ""BYNTE"" not a word.

Perhaps **LINED** — L I N E D → position3=N? Position sequence: L,I,N,E,D → position3=N, position4=E. But we need position3=E. So no.

Another thought: what about ""QUEEN"" — Q U E E N → position3=E—yes! Letters: Q,U,E,E,N. Position3=E—good. But Q? And E at position4 also.

""QUEEN"" — positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E (good), 4:E, 5:N. Now, letters: Q,U,E,E,N.

Absentees: no C,R,A,S,T,I—Q and U are untested. Valid? Q is less common but legitimate.

Alternatives: **GIVEN** — G I V E N → position3=V? Positions: G,I,V,E,N → position3=V, not E.

Need position3=E.

**HAVEN** — H A V E N → position4=E? Positions: H,A,V,E,N → position4=E. Not.

Must have pattern: either N in position1 with E at 3: like NEEDY, NEEFL? Not, NEEDY as above (NEEDY: N,E,E,D,Y → position3=E).

Other words with N position1 and E position3: 
- **NEWEL**: N E W E L → position3=W? Positions: N,E,W,E,L → position2=E, position3=W—not E. Wrong unless second letter is E? No.

NE?E? words: like NEARS? S absent and A absent.

Focusing: for ""N _ E _ _"": 
NEEDS: S absent.
NEIGH: I absent.
NERDS: R absent.
NEXUS: X not tested, but S absent? S banned.

With avoiding S and others: NEPER? E P E R → R absent.

Not many common ones. 

Perhaps N position2: word pattern ? N E ? ?

Like ""PUNCH"": P U N C H → position3=N? Not E.

Position3=E: so sequence after N must be E in the third position.

Possible words: 
- KNEEP: K N E E P → positions: K,N,E,E,P → position3=E—yes. Letters: K,N,E,E,P. Avoids absentees? C,R,A,S,T,I absent? Yes, K,N,E,E,P — N and E confirmed, K and P new.

Valid word? ""KNEEP"" might not be common—check dictionary? Assuming Wordle accepts variant, but let's see alternatives.

**LYNED**: Not common.

**OWNED**: O W N E D → positions: O,W,N,E,D → position3=N? Position sequence: position1:O,2:W,3:N,position4=E—not E at 3.

**UNTIE**: U N T I E → position5=E? Position sequence: U,N,T,I,E → positions:1:U,2:N,3:T,4:I,5:E—position3=T, not E. And T and I absent—invalid.

Another idea: **UNWED**: U N W E D → position4=E? Positions: U,N,W,E,D → position3=W, position4=E—not E at 3.

Correcting: to satisfy position3=E, possible word? 

Examples like ""ANODE"" — A absent.

""INNER""—I absent.

""ENEMY""—E position1, N position2, E position3—yes: E N E M Y → avoiding absentees? Letters: E,N,E,M,Y—no C,R,A,S,T,I? OK. But is E position1 allowed? We don't know yet. Constraints only on N and E positions, not prohibiting E elsewhere.

So ""ENEMY"": positions:1:E, 2:N, 3:E, 4:M, 5:Y—position3=E—good. Also N at position2—so N is not in positions 4 or 5, which matches.

Similarly, ""MINED""—I absent—invalid.

So ""ENEMY"" seems valid: 
- E at position1 — untested? Could be present or not.
- N at position2 — we know N must be somewhere, here position2—possible.
- E at position3 — fixed ✓.
- M and Y new.

If ""ENEMY"" is the word, but we need to confirm.

Another word: **ONCER**—O N C E R: C and R absent—invalid.

Back to Case 1: N position1: e.g., NEEDY.

From feedback, ""stein"" had E at position3 correct and N present but not position5.

In NEEDY: N position1, E position2 and 3, etc.

Could be.

But ENEMY has N position2.

To maximize information:
- Guess NEEDY to test N in position1 and double-E possibility.
- Or ENEMY to test N in position2 and new letters.

But we have only 6 tries, so need efficient.

Since E is fixed at position3, and N must be in 1 or 2, I can choose a word that:
- Places N in position 1 (to test Case 1)
- Or position2 (Case 2)

If I place N in position1, and if it's position1 is ✓ in reality, I get info.

Similarly for position2.

Either way, I'll cover.

Choose common letters: L, O, K, etc.

Option: **NEVER**—E and R? R absent—invalid.

**LEVEL**—L,E,V,E,L → position1:L,2:E,3:V—position3=V? Not E—unless.

Must be E at position3.

Another: **BELIE**—B E L I E → position3=L? Not E.

Difficult to find words.

**OUNCE**—not.

Or **BEVEL**—B E V E L, position3=V? Not E.

Perhaps uncommon words? Wordle usually uses common words.

List: 
For pattern ""? N E ? ?"": 
- **ANGEL**: A absent—no
- **ENGED**? Not a word.
- **INKED**—I absent.
- **OKNED**? No.

Better to think of common words.

**LONGE**: L O N G E → positions: L,O,N,G,E → position3=N, not E—unless: word ""Longe"" not common.

Alternate: **HONEY** — position3=N, not E.

Perhaps ""CHIEF"" not, position varies.

Another try: position3=E, position2=N → words ending with N E? But not.

So possible words: ""DIENED"" not 5 letters.

Accept that double-E might be possible? Or other.

""NEEDS"": S absent—invalid.

""NEIGH"": I absent.

So rare with avoided letters.

Perhaps N position1: pattern N ? E ? ? 

Examples: NEEDS — invalid.
NERVED: R absent.
NUKED: U,K,E,D — N at1, E at3: N U K E D → positions: N,U,K,E,D — position3=K, position4=E? Not E at3—position3 must be K? Wrong.

Except if second letter allows E? Like NE E something.

Specifically N E E ? ? → NEED? But D — possible, NEED is 5-letter? Need is 4? NEEDY as I thought.

NEEDY is valid: N E E D Y -> positions:1:N,2:E,3:E,4:D,5:Y

Yes, NEEDY is a valid word: lacking in money; poor.

Similarly, NEWER: N E W E R -> positions:1:N,2:E,3:W,4:E—position3=W not E. Invalid for position3.

So NEEDY works for pattern: position1:N, position2:E, position3:E, etc. Position3 is E—good. Also contains E at position2.

Now, we haven't ruled out multiple E's, so it's possible.

Next option: ENEMY (E N E M Y).

Both are plausible.

To choose between NEEDY and ENEMY.

NEEDY tests N in position1.
ENEMY tests N in position2.

Also, NEEDY has D and Y, ENEMY has M and Y.

Since both contain E at position2—in NEEDY position2=E and ENEMY position1=E—but position1=E is not confirmed.

For information:
If I guess ENEMY, and if N is indeed in position2, then I might get ✓ for N position2. If not, it might be marked - or X—but we know N is present.

Similarly for NEEDY: position1=N, which is a possible location.

Given that S is absent, T absent, etc. Prioritize testing N position.

I could guess a word with N in position1 and new letters.

Or since ENEMY also tests position1=E, which wasn't tested before.

ENEMY has advantages: tests E at position1 (possible), N at position2 (possible).

Whereas NEEDY has E at position2 again—but if secret has only one E, it might be weird, but possible.

Both work.

Choose ENEMY? Or for new letters like O.

Other possibilities: **BEIGY** — not, position vary.

**GUESSED** not.

Decide on ENEMY.

But let's see feedback implied: in ""crane"", E was marked - meaning present but not position5. Now with E at position3 fixed.

Guess: ENEMY

If secret is ENEMY, feedback: E at position1? Unknown, N position2? Could be -, E position3 ✓, M position4? Unknown, Y position5 unknown.

Similarly, if NEEDY, N position1 possible.

But ENEMY also tests M and Y—useful.

Another option: **OPENS** — contains S absent—no.

**YANKS** — A absent.

I am considering **KENDO** — K E N D O → position3=N, not E—invalid.

So back. 

Another word: **BEGIN** — G I N — positions: B,E,G,I,N → position2=E, position3=G—not E.

Must have E at position3.

Perhaps ""THREE"" — T H R E E → R absent and position4=E.

Not.

I think ENEMY is acceptable.

Or NEEDY.

But to test more common letters: NEEDY uses D and Y, ENEMY uses M and Y.

M is less common than L, O? Probably fine.

Going with ENEMY, as it positions N at2—untested spot.

Similarly, we haven't tested position1 at all—in both guesses, position1 was C then S, both absent.

Position1 could be many things.

So ENEMY is a valid guess.

Therefore, next guess: ENEMY

Check constraints:
- Position3:E ✓
- N must be present, not in position4 or5—here position2, good.
- Excluded letters: C,R,A,S,T,I—none in ENEMY.### Deductive Reasoning Steps:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:  
   - Guess 1 (""crane""): C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)  
     - Letters `C`, `R`, `A` are **absent** from the secret word.  
     - `N` is present but **not in position 4**.  
     - `E` is present but **not in position 5**.  
   - Guess 2 (""stein""): S(x), T(x), E(✓), I(x), N(-)  
     - Letters `S`, `T`, `I` are **absent**.  
     - `E` is confirmed in **position 3** (correct placement).  
     - `N` is present but **not in position 5**.  

2. **Confirm Known Letters**:  
   - `E` is fixed at **position 3** of the secret word.  
   - `N` is present but excluded from positions 4 and 5 (from Guess 1 and Guess 2 feedback). Thus, `N` must be in **position 1 or 2**.  
   - Absent letters: `C`, `R`, `A`, `S`, `T`, `I` cannot appear.  

3. **Deduce Word Pattern**:  
   - Secret pattern: `[position1] [position2] E [position4] [position5]`.  
   - Position 1 or 2 must be `N`.  
   - Untested positions: 1, 2, 4, and 5 need new letters.  

4. **Prioritize Next Guess Goals**:  
   - Test `N`'s position (1 or 2) and cover new high-frequency letters.  
   - Use only untested letters: Avoid `C,R,A,S,T,I`; prioritize common consonants/vowels like `M`, `Y`, `L`, `O`, `D`, `H`.  
   - Reposition `N` to an untested spot (either position 1 or 2) while keeping `E` fixed at position 3.  

5. **Candidate Words**:  
   - **Option 1: `N` in position 1** (e.g., `NEEDY`).  
     - Pattern: `N E E D Y`. Tests position 1 for `N` and new letters `D`, `Y`. Double `E` possible.  
     - Concerns: `E` at position 2 may conflict if no duplicate `E`, but feedback hasn't ruled this out.  
   - **Option 2: `N` in position 2** (e.g., `ENEMY`).  
     - Pattern: `E N E M Y`. Tests position 2 for `N`, position 1 for `E` (possible duplication), and new letters `M`, `Y`.  
   - Final choice: `ENEMY` is stronger:  
     - Tests `N` position 2 (untested location).  
     - Efficiently probes multiple constraints: `N` displacement, `E` duplication (positions 1 and 3), and uses common letters (`M`, `Y`).  
     - Avoids all excluded letters.  

6. **Word Validity**:  
   - `ENEMY` is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning ""hostile entity"" or adversary).

That immediately eliminates a big chunk of possibilities.\n- N and E are marked as ""-"", so both N and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions I guessed them in.\n\nBreaking this down:\n\n1. **Letters to exclude:** C, R, A are completely out. That\'s significant because R and A are very common letters. The secret word must avoid these entirely.\n2. **Letters to include:** Both N and E must be in the word somewhere, but:\n   - N is not in the 4th position (since I guessed it there and it\'s wrong position).\n   - E is not in the 5th position (since I guessed it there and it\'s wrong position).\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Contains N and E\n- Excludes C, R, A\n- Is 5 letters long\n\nNow, I need a new guess that incorporates these constraints:\n- Must include N and E (but not in positions 4 or 5 respectively)\n- Must exclude C, R, A\n- Should test new letters to gather more information\n\nSince N and E are confirmed in the word, I\'ll prioritize keeping them in my next guess but in different positions to test their real locations. I\'ll also introduce new common letters since C/R/A are out—good candidates would be T, O, S, L, M, etc.\n\nPossible approach:\n1. **Reposition N:** Since N wasn\'t in position 4, I could try it in position 2, 3, or 5.\n2. **Reposition E:** Since E wasn\'t in position 5, I could move it to position 1, 2, or 3.\n3. **New letters:** Test other common letters like T, O, S, L, etc.\n\nI should avoid positions where we already ruled them out, though:\n\n- Since N was eliminated from position 4, I can place it in 1,2,3, or 5, but caution: position 5 was originally E\'s spot which might conflict if I put N there. Similarly, E can\'t be in position 5 so I have to avoid that placement.\n\nGiven E is highly likely to be somewhere in positions 1-4, and N cannot be in position 4.\n\nGood second guesses should maximize information:\n- Keep N and E to verify their positions\n- Use fresh high-frequency letters: S, T, L, O, M, D, etc.\n\nConsidering possible words that fit:\n- Must include N and E\n- Exclude C, R, A\n\nFor example:\n- Words like **STONE**, **STEIN**, **LEMON**, **MEANT**, **SPINE**\n  \nNow evaluating each:\n- **STONE**: S T O N E → Tests S,T,O (new), keeps N/E but moves them (N to position 4 was bad, but I\'m trying position 4 again? Wait, the feedback said N was present but not in position 4—so placing it in position 4 again is useless. I should move N to a new spot to test its real location.)\n  \nBetter alternatives where N and E shift positions:\n- **MEANT**: M E A N T → But A is excluded! Invalid, since A is ruled out.\n- **SPINE**: S P I N E → This is better. Places E in position 5? But E cannot be in position 5 per feedback. So invalid placement.\n  \nAh, constraint: E cannot be in position 5. So any candidate must place E in positions 1-4 and N not in position 4.\n\nGood options:\n- **N** can be in positions 1,2,3,5\n- **E** can be in 1,2,3,4\n  \nLook for words featuring N and E while avoiding positions that are forbidden AND excluding C,R,A.\n\nStrong candidate: **STEIN** (S,T,E,I,N)\n- It places E in position 3 (avoiding position 5)\n- Places N in position 5 (since position 4 was bad, trying a new spot)\n- Tests S,T,I (new letters)\n- Avoids C,R,A\n\nAnother option: **TOKEN** (T,O,K,E,N) but O and K might be less common.\n\n**STEIN** seems solid:\n- Gives chance to confirm positions of E (pos3) and N (pos5). If either lights up as ""✓"", we\'ve nailed them. If ""-"", we know they\'re elsewhere but still in the word.\n\nAlternatively, **LINES** (L,I,N,E,S) — but N in position 3 (which might be fine), E in 4. Avoids position 4 for N? Yes. Also avoids E in position 5.\n\nBut **LINES** ends with S. That might be okay since S is common. However, starting with L tests a less frequent letter? Not crucial—S,T are higher frequency anyway.\n\nComparing:\n**STEIN**: Tests S,T,E,I,N with E in position 3 and N in position 5—new positions for both ruled-out placements.\n\n**LINES**: N in position 3 (new), E in position 4 (also new position for E). This is fairly equivalent too.\n\nI\'ll select **STEIN** since T and S feel slightly more common than L and I. Plus “stein” is a familiar word.\n\nTherefore, next guess: STEIN\n\nLet me validate:\n- Includes N and E\n- Avoids C,R,A\n- Repositions both (E not in 5th, N not in 4th)\n- Tests S,T,I—high-value consonants.\n\nSeems strategically sound.Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (""CRANE"" → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)):  \n- **C, R, A** are **completely absent** from the secret word.  \n- **N and E** are **present**, but **not in position 4** (for N) or **position 5** (for E).  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n- Must include **N and E** (with N not in position 4; E not in position 5).  \n- Must exclude C, R, A.  \n- To maximize information, focus on **high-frequency letters** (e.g., S, T, L, O) and reposition N/E to untested spots.  \n\nI chose **STEIN**:  \n- Tests S/T/I (new common letters) while retaining N/E in new positions (E in position 3; N in position 5).  \n- Avoids C/R/A entirely.  \n- Efficiently probes E/N positions and expands letter coverage.\n\n<guess>stein</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(✓) I(x) N(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'After reviewing the feedback from the first two guesses:\n\nFrom Guess 1 (""crane""): \n- C, R, A are absent (x)\n- N is present but not in position 4 (-)\n- E is present but not in position 5 (-)\n\nFrom Guess 2 (""stein""):\n- S and T are absent (x)\n- E is correct and in position 3 (✓)  [since it was the third letter]\n- I is absent (x)\n- N is present but not in position 5 (-)  [since it was guessed in position 5]\n\nCurrent deductions:\n- **Secret word contains**: E (fixed in position 3) and N (somewhere, but not position 4 or 5). From ""crane"", E was present but not in position 5. Now E is fixed at position 3.\n\n- **Letters confirmed absent**: C, R, A, S, T, I.\n\n- **Position constraints**:\n  - Position 3 is E (fixed from ""stein"" feedback).\n  - N is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (since it was misplaced there in past guesses).\n    - So N must be in position 1 or 2.\n\nNow expanding:\n- Secret word pattern: _ _ E _ _ \n- Position 1 or 2 must be N.\n\nWe also need additional letters that haven\'t been tested yet. Letters tested so far: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, I. Absentees: C, R, A, S, T, I.\n\nRemaining letters to test: Common consonants/vowels like B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, possibly others.\n\nWe know:\n- Word: ? ? E ? ? \n- N is in position 1 or 2.\n\nGiven the absence of many common letters, the secret word likely uses less frequent letters. We should prioritize:\n- Confirming N\'s position: try it in position 1 or 2.\n- Testing new high-frequency letters: L, O, D, M, etc.\n\nPossible words that fit:\n- Structure: N E ? ? ? or ? N E ? ? \n\nBut E is fixed as the third character, so it\'s actually [letter1] [letter2] E [letter4] [letter5]\n\nAnd N must be letter1 or letter2.\n\nCase 1: N is in position 1 → N _ E _ _\nCase 2: N is in position 2 → _ N E _ _\n\nWe need a valid English word satisfying:\n- Does not contain C, R, A, S, T, I\n- Contains N (in 1 or 2)\n- Contains E (in position 3)\n- The other letters are unknown.\n\nPossible examples:\nFor ""N _ E _ _"": Possible words: NEWER? But W is untested. NEWER contains E at position 3? N E W E R → position3 is W, not E? Wait no—""NEWER"" is N E W E R → position 3 is W. So incorrect.\n\nNeed position 3 to be E.\n\nAnother: NEEDY → N E E D Y → position3 is E? Position3 is E (second E). Okay ""NEEDY"" has N position1, E position2, E position3? But our guess requires position3 to be E—""NEEDY"" has E at position2 and 3. But we know from feedback that E is only confirmed at position3, not whether there\'s another E.\n\nActually, ""steine"" had E at position3, and it was marked correct. So position3 must be E, but other E\'s could exist? Not forbidden yet.\n\nSimilarly, ""crane"" had E at position5 marked absent? No feedback: E was misplaced (wrong position) in ""crane""—it was guessed in position5. That doesn\'t preclude E elsewhere. But in ""stein"", E position3 was ✓, so position3 is definitely E.\n\nNow, looking for words with E in position3 and starting with N or second letter N.\n\nPossible words:\n- If position1 is N: N ? E ? ? → e.g., NODES? But S is absent, invalid. Similarly NAKED? A absent.\n\nAvoiding absentees: C,R,A,S,T,I are out.\n\nOptions:\n- For N in position1: Words like NEEDY → N E E D Y → positions: 1:N, 2:E, 3:E (but E at position3 is fixed—yes), 4:D, 5:Y\n  - Does ""NEEDY"" work? Position3 is E—good.\n  - Letters: N,E,E,D,Y → we know E is allowed, N is in, D and Y untested, and note the double-E. Can we have multiple E\'s? The feedback from ""stein"" about E didn\'t specify if it\'s the only E—it just marked position3 as correct and didn\'t comment on other positions.\n  - However, ""NEEDY"" contains E at position2 as well—but position2 is not yet confirmed. So possible—no contradiction.\n  - Also, absent letters: avoiding C,R,A,S,T,I—yes.\n- Alternatively, NEIGH → N E I G H → I is absent! Forbidden.\n- NOMEN: Too obscure, and O,E,M,N → O and M untested.\n\nFor position2 is N: _ N E _ _\n\nWords like SNORE? S absent—invalid.\nMONEY → M O N E Y → Position2:N (yes), position3:E? Position3 is N—wait: ""MONEY"" letters: M O N E Y → positions:1:M, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:Y → but we have position3 must be E, not N. Incorrect.\n\nCorrect pattern: position3 is E.\n\nSo ""MONEY"" is M O N E Y → position3=N, not E. Wrong.\n\nAnother try: word like ""HONEY"" — H O N E Y → position1:H, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E → position3 is N—not E.\n\nI need something like _ N E _ _ → so character2=N, character3=E.\n\nExamples: INEPT? I absent—invalid.\nONCER? O absent? No, O present? Let\'s list words: AGNES? A absent. So avoiding absentees.\n\nPossible words:\n- **UNMET**: U N M E T → positions:1:U, position2:N, position3:M? Position3 is M—not E. Wrong.\nStructure must be letter1, then N at position2, then E at position3.\n\nSo: ? N E ? ?\n\nValid words: \n- **ANKER**: A absent—invalid.\n- But avoiding C,R,A,S,T,I—so consider letters like O, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\n**BUNCH**: B U N C H → position2=N? Positions:1:B, 2:U, 3:N—not E. Wrong.\n\nNeed position3=E specifically.\n\nSo "" ? N E ? ?"" meaning:\nPosition1: some letter (call it X)\nPosition2: N\nPosition3: E\nPosition4: Y\nPosition5: Z\n\nSo word = [X] N E [Y] [Z]\n\nValid example: **ANGUS** — But G and U present? A is absent? ANGUS has A—invalid.\n\nAnother: **INKER** — I absent.\n\n**OUNCE** — O U N C E → position1:O, 2:U, 3:N—not E.\n\nI\'m struggling. Look for English words ending with ""ENE"" or something? But position3=E, so not ending.\n\nCommon words: like ""BYNTE"" not a word.\n\nPerhaps **LINED** — L I N E D → position3=N? Position sequence: L,I,N,E,D → position3=N, position4=E. But we need position3=E. So no.\n\nAnother thought: what about ""QUEEN"" — Q U E E N → position3=E—yes! Letters: Q,U,E,E,N. Position3=E—good. But Q? And E at position4 also.\n\n""QUEEN"" — positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E (good), 4:E, 5:N. Now, letters: Q,U,E,E,N.\n\nAbsentees: no C,R,A,S,T,I—Q and U are untested. Valid? Q is less common but legitimate.\n\nAlternatives: **GIVEN** — G I V E N → position3=V? Positions: G,I,V,E,N → position3=V, not E.\n\nNeed position3=E.\n\n**HAVEN** — H A V E N → position4=E? Positions: H,A,V,E,N → position4=E. Not.\n\nMust have pattern: either N in position1 with E at 3: like NEEDY, NEEFL? Not, NEEDY as above (NEEDY: N,E,E,D,Y → position3=E).\n\nOther words with N position1 and E position3: \n- **NEWEL**: N E W E L → position3=W? Positions: N,E,W,E,L → position2=E, position3=W—not E. Wrong unless second letter is E? No.\n\nNE?E? words: like NEARS? S absent and A absent.\n\nFocusing: for ""N _ E _ _"": \nNEEDS: S absent.\nNEIGH: I absent.\nNERDS: R absent.\nNEXUS: X not tested, but S absent? S banned.\n\nWith avoiding S and others: NEPER? E P E R → R absent.\n\nNot many common ones. \n\nPerhaps N position2: word pattern ? N E ? ?\n\nLike ""PUNCH"": P U N C H → position3=N? Not E.\n\nPosition3=E: so sequence after N must be E in the third position.\n\nPossible words: \n- KNEEP: K N E E P → positions: K,N,E,E,P → position3=E—yes. Letters: K,N,E,E,P. Avoids absentees? C,R,A,S,T,I absent? Yes, K,N,E,E,P — N and E confirmed, K and P new.\n\nValid word? ""KNEEP"" might not be common—check dictionary? Assuming Wordle accepts variant, but let\'s see alternatives.\n\n**LYNED**: Not common.\n\n**OWNED**: O W N E D → positions: O,W,N,E,D → position3=N? Position sequence: position1:O,2:W,3:N,position4=E—not E at 3.\n\n**UNTIE**: U N T I E → position5=E? Position sequence: U,N,T,I,E → positions:1:U,2:N,3:T,4:I,5:E—position3=T, not E. And T and I absent—invalid.\n\nAnother idea: **UNWED**: U N W E D → position4=E? Positions: U,N,W,E,D → position3=W, position4=E—not E at 3.\n\nCorrecting: to satisfy position3=E, possible word? \n\nExamples like ""ANODE"" — A absent.\n\n""INNER""—I absent.\n\n""ENEMY""—E position1, N position2, E position3—yes: E N E M Y → avoiding absentees? Letters: E,N,E,M,Y—no C,R,A,S,T,I? OK. But is E position1 allowed? We don\'t know yet. Constraints only on N and E positions, not prohibiting E elsewhere.\n\nSo ""ENEMY"": positions:1:E, 2:N, 3:E, 4:M, 5:Y—position3=E—good. Also N at position2—so N is not in positions 4 or 5, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, ""MINED""—I absent—invalid.\n\nSo ""ENEMY"" seems valid: \n- E at position1 — untested? Could be present or not.\n- N at position2 — we know N must be somewhere, here position2—possible.\n- E at position3 — fixed ✓.\n- M and Y new.\n\nIf ""ENEMY"" is the word, but we need to confirm.\n\nAnother word: **ONCER**—O N C E R: C and R absent—invalid.\n\nBack to Case 1: N position1: e.g., NEEDY.\n\nFrom feedback, ""stein"" had E at position3 correct and N present but not position5.\n\nIn NEEDY: N position1, E position2 and 3, etc.\n\nCould be.\n\nBut ENEMY has N position2.\n\nTo maximize information:\n- Guess NEEDY to test N in position1 and double-E possibility.\n- Or ENEMY to test N in position2 and new letters.\n\nBut we have only 6 tries, so need efficient.\n\nSince E is fixed at position3, and N must be in 1 or 2, I can choose a word that:\n- Places N in position 1 (to test Case 1)\n- Or position2 (Case 2)\n\nIf I place N in position1, and if it\'s position1 is ✓ in reality, I get info.\n\nSimilarly for position2.\n\nEither way, I\'ll cover.\n\nChoose common letters: L, O, K, etc.\n\nOption: **NEVER**—E and R? R absent—invalid.\n\n**LEVEL**—L,E,V,E,L → position1:L,2:E,3:V—position3=V? Not E—unless.\n\nMust be E at position3.\n\nAnother: **BELIE**—B E L I E → position3=L? Not E.\n\nDifficult to find words.\n\n**OUNCE**—not.\n\nOr **BEVEL**—B E V E L, position3=V? Not E.\n\nPerhaps uncommon words? Wordle usually uses common words.\n\nList: \nFor pattern ""? N E ? ?"": \n- **ANGEL**: A absent—no\n- **ENGED**? Not a word.\n- **INKED**—I absent.\n- **OKNED**? No.\n\nBetter to think of common words.\n\n**LONGE**: L O N G E → positions: L,O,N,G,E → position3=N, not E—unless: word ""Longe"" not common.\n\nAlternate: **HONEY** — position3=N, not E.\n\nPerhaps ""CHIEF"" not, position varies.\n\nAnother try: position3=E, position2=N → words ending with N E? But not.\n\nSo possible words: ""DIENED"" not 5 letters.\n\nAccept that double-E might be possible? Or other.\n\n""NEEDS"": S absent—invalid.\n\n""NEIGH"": I absent.\n\nSo rare with avoided letters.\n\nPerhaps N position1: pattern N ? E ? ? \n\nExamples: NEEDS — invalid.\nNERVED: R absent.\nNUKED: U,K,E,D — N at1, E at3: N U K E D → positions: N,U,K,E,D — position3=K, position4=E? Not E at3—position3 must be K? Wrong.\n\nExcept if second letter allows E? Like NE E something.\n\nSpecifically N E E ? ? → NEED? But D — possible, NEED is 5-letter? Need is 4? NEEDY as I thought.\n\nNEEDY is valid: N E E D Y -> positions:1:N,2:E,3:E,4:D,5:Y\n\nYes, NEEDY is a valid word: lacking in money; poor.\n\nSimilarly, NEWER: N E W E R -> positions:1:N,2:E,3:W,4:E—position3=W not E. Invalid for position3.\n\nSo NEEDY works for pattern: position1:N, position2:E, position3:E, etc. Position3 is E—good. Also contains E at position2.\n\nNow, we haven\'t ruled out multiple E\'s, so it\'s possible.\n\nNext option: ENEMY (E N E M Y).\n\nBoth are plausible.\n\nTo choose between NEEDY and ENEMY.\n\nNEEDY tests N in position1.\nENEMY tests N in position2.\n\nAlso, NEEDY has D and Y, ENEMY has M and Y.\n\nSince both contain E at position2—in NEEDY position2=E and ENEMY position1=E—but position1=E is not confirmed.\n\nFor information:\nIf I guess ENEMY, and if N is indeed in position2, then I might get ✓ for N position2. If not, it might be marked - or X—but we know N is present.\n\nSimilarly for NEEDY: position1=N, which is a possible location.\n\nGiven that S is absent, T absent, etc. Prioritize testing N position.\n\nI could guess a word with N in position1 and new letters.\n\nOr since ENEMY also tests position1=E, which wasn\'t tested before.\n\nENEMY has advantages: tests E at position1 (possible), N at position2 (possible).\n\nWhereas NEEDY has E at position2 again—but if secret has only one E, it might be weird, but possible.\n\nBoth work.\n\nChoose ENEMY? Or for new letters like O.\n\nOther possibilities: **BEIGY** — not, position vary.\n\n**GUESSED** not.\n\nDecide on ENEMY.\n\nBut let\'s see feedback implied: in ""crane"", E was marked - meaning present but not position5. Now with E at position3 fixed.\n\nGuess: ENEMY\n\nIf secret is ENEMY, feedback: E at position1? Unknown, N position2? Could be -, E position3 ✓, M position4? Unknown, Y position5 unknown.\n\nSimilarly, if NEEDY, N position1 possible.\n\nBut ENEMY also tests M and Y—useful.\n\nAnother option: **OPENS** — contains S absent—no.\n\n**YANKS** — A absent.\n\nI am considering **KENDO** — K E N D O → position3=N, not E—invalid.\n\nSo back. \n\nAnother word: **BEGIN** — G I N — positions: B,E,G,I,N → position2=E, position3=G—not E.\n\nMust have E at position3.\n\nPerhaps ""THREE"" — T H R E E → R absent and position4=E.\n\nNot.\n\nI think ENEMY is acceptable.\n\nOr NEEDY.\n\nBut to test more common letters: NEEDY uses D and Y, ENEMY uses M and Y.\n\nM is less common than L, O? Probably fine.\n\nGoing with ENEMY, as it positions N at2—untested spot.\n\nSimilarly, we haven\'t tested position1 at all—in both guesses, position1 was C then S, both absent.\n\nPosition1 could be many things.\n\nSo ENEMY is a valid guess.\n\nTherefore, next guess: ENEMY\n\nCheck constraints:\n- Position3:E ✓\n- N must be present, not in position4 or5—here position2, good.\n- Excluded letters: C,R,A,S,T,I—none in ENEMY.### Deductive Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Review Previous Feedback**:  \n   - Guess 1 (""crane""): C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)  \n     - Letters `C`, `R`, `A` are **absent** from the secret word.  \n     - `N` is present but **not in position 4**.  \n     - `E` is present but **not in position 5**.  \n   - Guess 2 (""stein""): S(x), T(x), E(✓), I(x), N(-)  \n     - Letters `S`, `T`, `I` are **absent**.  \n     - `E` is confirmed in **position 3** (correct placement).  \n     - `N` is present but **not in position 5**.  \n\n2. **Confirm Known Letters**:  \n   - `E` is fixed at **position 3** of the secret word.  \n   - `N` is present but excluded from positions 4 and 5 (from Guess 1 and Guess 2 feedback). Thus, `N` must be in **position 1 or 2**.  \n   - Absent letters: `C`, `R`, `A`, `S`, `T`, `I` cannot appear.  \n\n3. **Deduce Word Pattern**:  \n   - Secret pattern: `[position1] [position2] E [position4] [position5]`.  \n   - Position 1 or 2 must be `N`.  \n   - Untested positions: 1, 2, 4, and 5 need new letters.  \n\n4. **Prioritize Next Guess Goals**:  \n   - Test `N`\'s position (1 or 2) and cover new high-frequency letters.  \n   - Use only untested letters: Avoid `C,R,A,S,T,I`; prioritize common consonants/vowels like `M`, `Y`, `L`, `O`, `D`, `H`.  \n   - Reposition `N` to an untested spot (either position 1 or 2) while keeping `E` fixed at position 3.  \n\n5. **Candidate Words**:  \n   - **Option 1: `N` in position 1** (e.g., `NEEDY`).  \n     - Pattern: `N E E D Y`. Tests position 1 for `N` and new letters `D`, `Y`. Double `E` possible.  \n     - Concerns: `E` at position 2 may conflict if no duplicate `E`, but feedback hasn\'t ruled this out.  \n   - **Option 2: `N` in position 2** (e.g., `ENEMY`).  \n     - Pattern: `E N E M Y`. Tests position 2 for `N`, position 1 for `E` (possible duplication), and new letters `M`, `Y`.  \n   - Final choice: `ENEMY` is stronger:  \n     - Tests `N` position 2 (untested location).  \n     - Efficiently probes multiple constraints: `N` displacement, `E` duplication (positions 1 and 3), and uses common letters (`M`, `Y`).  \n     - Avoids all excluded letters.  \n\n6. **Word Validity**:  \n   - `ENEMY` is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning ""hostile entity"" or adversary).\n\n<guess>enemy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(✓) I(x) N(-)\nGuess 3: enemy -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(✓) E(✓) M(x) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
After reviewing all feedback:

**Summary of Known Information:**
1. **Secret word contains**: 
   - E (present but not fixed everywhere, since Guess 1 showed E is present but not in position 5, and Guess 2 confirmed E is correctly in position 3). 
   - N (present, and Guess 3 shows N is correctly in position 2). 
2. **Confirmed positions**: 
   - Position 3: E (✓ from Guess 2 and 3) 
   - Position 2: N (✓ from Guess 3) 
3. **Constraints based on feedback**: 
   - E is not in position 5 (Guess 1) and not any other position besides position 3? But E is marked as '-' in position 1 of Guess 3, meaning E exists elsewhere—so E might be duplicated. Position 3 E is correct. Position 1 E is wrong position, so E must be present at least twice? 
   - N is in position 2. 
   - M and Y are absent (x in Guess 3). 
4. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, S, T, I, M, Y. 
   This significantly reduces the alphabet. 
   Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, P, U, V, W, Z, etc.

**Breaking down the pattern:** 
- Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 
- We know: position 2 is N, position 3 is E. 
- So pattern: _ N E _ _ 
- From Guess 3: enemy gave E at position 1: marked as '-' meaning E is present but not in position 1. Therefore, since E is confirmed at position 3, the '-' for E in position 1 implies there's at least one other E elsewhere? Or it could be referring to position 3? No—the feedback per position: position 1 E is marked '-', meaning that the letter E is in the word but should not be in position 1. Similarly, position 3 E is marked '✓', so it's correctly placed. 
Therefore, there must be at least one more E in the word besides position 3—because E at position 1 is absent but E is present elsewhere? The '-' indicates E is in the word but not in position 1. Since E is already fixed at position 3, the '-' reinforces that E exists and that position 1 is incorrect, which we already know from position 3. But '-' for a letter implies the letter is present, but in a different position. Therefore, if E is marked '-' at position 1, and we know E is at position 3, this could mean either:
  - There is only one E (at position 3), and the '-' at position 1 just tells us E exists and position 1 is wrong—which is consistent—or...
  - There are multiple E's, and the '-' at position 1 indicates E is present elsewhere beyond position 3. 

But regardless, the '-' doesn't necessarily imply duplication; it only indicates the letter exists but not here. Since position 3 is confirmed E, the '-' at position 1 doesn't require a duplicate—it just confirms E is somewhere else (which is position 3). But it doesn't provide new info beyond confirming E is present and not in position 1. 

Similarly, N at position 2 is correct ✓.

So pattern: position 2 = N, position 3 = E → word is _ N E _ _ 

Additionally, from Guess 3: 
- Position 1 E: '-' → E is present, but not here (could be position 3).
- Position 4 M: x → M absent
- Position 5 Y: x → Y absent

**Deductions:**
- Secret word format: exactly: [letter1] N E [letter4] [letter5]
- Letter1 cannot be E (since E was guessed in position 1 and marked '-'). But E might be duplicated? The '-' doesn't prevent E in other positions except 1? 

But E is confirmed only at position 3 so far. 

Could letter1 be E? No—if E were in position 1, it should be marked accordingly; here, it was marked '-', meaning E is in the word but not position 1. Since E at position 3 is ✓, so position 1 cannot be E. 

Similarly, letter4 and letter5 must differ from M and Y.

Now, letters to exclude: C,R,A,S,T,I,M,Y.
Possible letters for positions 1,4,5: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,O,P,U,V,W,Z

Additionally, since E might be repeated? We need to consider—word might have duplicate E? Not necessarily—but from feedback, position 1 E marked '-' only tells us E is not at position 1 and exists. 

Therefore, possibilities:
- If there's another E beyond position 3, it must be in position 4 or 5? Or not? Positions 4 and 5 are available.

Looking for English words with pattern _ N E _ _ avoiding C,R,A,S,T,I,M,Y.

Common examples:
- **UNLED**? Not common.
- **ONELL**? Not words.

Better: 
- **INLAY** — I absent
- **BLEED** — B L E E D → pattern not _ N E _, incorrect—must have N at position2 and E at position3.

So ? N E ? ?

Possible words:
- **ANKER** — A absent
- **ENDED** — E N D E D → positions: position1:E (but E cannot be position1? From feedback, Guess 3 has E at position1 marked '-', meaning E should not be in position1. Therefore ENDED would have E at position1—invalid for guess. Similarly, for the secret word if E is at position1, but why mark it as wrong position? Contradiction? The secret word cannot have E at position1 because Guess tried E at position1 and was told it's not correct. Therefore, in secret word, position1 must NOT be E.

Therefore, secret word pattern: letter1 ≠ E, letter2=N, letter3=E.

Similarly, letters 4 and 5 ≠ M,Y.

Words: 
- **UNDER** — U N D E R → but R is absent? R banned? Guess 1 banned R, so R absent—cannot have R.
- **DINED** — D I N E D → I absent—invalid.
- **FONDU** — F O N D U → not pattern — position3=N, not E? Must be E at position3.

Need E at position3 explicitly.

**HONED** — H O N E D → positions: H,O,N,E,D → position3=N? Not E—wrong.
Position sequence: position1=H,2=O,3=N,4=E—position4=E, not position3.

Must have position3=E—fixed.

So pattern: ? N E ? ?

So letters at1: something, at2=N, at3=E, at4: something, at5:something.

Avoiding banned letters: C,R,A,S,T,I,M,Y banned.

Possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,O,P,U,V,W,Z

Words: 
- **GIVEN** — G I V E N → I banned—invalid
- **BAKED** — B A K E D → A banned—invalid
- **LUNGE** — L U N G E → pattern: positions1=L,2=U,3=N,4=G,5=E—not E at position3? Wrong unless: L U N G E has position3=N—not E.

Position3 must be E—so sequence after position2=N must be E at position3.

So examples:
- **KNELT**: K N E L T → T banned? T absent—invalid
- **SNEAK**: S banned—invalid
- **BLEED**: B L E E D → position2=L? Not N—wrong pattern.

I am missing—_ N E _ _

Like **ONEAR**? Not valid.

Perhaps **DONEE**? Not common.

Using letters: B, O, K, D, etc.

**BONED** — B O N E D → positions: B,O,N,E,D → position4=E? Position3=N—not E.

Position3 must be E—so N must be position2 and E position3.

**TOKEN** — T banned.

**WOMEN** — W O M E N → position4=E? Positions: W,O,M,E,N → position3=M—not E.

Except **QUEEN**: Q U E E N → positions: Q,U,E,E,N → position3=E? Position1=Q,2=U,3=E,4=E,5=N → indeed position3=E! Also position4=E? And letters: Q,U,E,E,N.

Now banned letters: C,R,A,S,T,I,M,Y—Q,U,N are OK? Yes.

Q is valid—uncommon but possible.

Avoided? Yes.

Similarly, **EJECT** — has banned T and C—invalid.

So QUEEN is possible.

Other options: **BEVEL** — position not.

**INLET** — T and I banned.

Another: **OUNCE** — O U N C E → position3=N—not E.

**FREED** — F R E E D → R banned—invalid.

**GREET** — R and T banned.

Back to QUEEN: pattern ? N E ? → Q U E E N matches positions: position1=Q? No, position1=Q, but our pattern is position2=N? QUEEN has position1=Q,2=U,3=E—position2=U, not N.

Misalignment: QUEEN has positions: Q,U,E,E,N—so position2 is U, position3 is E—it does not have position2=N. But our secret has position2=N fixed.

Therefore QUEEN does not match because position2 is U, whereas we need position2=N.

Confusion. Pattern is fixed: position2=N, position3=E.

So QUEEN has position3=E but position2=U ≠ N.

So invalid for this constraint.

Must have position2=N.

Therefore, words with pattern: [Position1] N E [Position4] [Position5]

Position1 ≠ E (from feedback)

Letters 4 and 5 not M,Y.

Possible words:
- **UNDID** — U N D I D → I banned—invalid
- **BONEY** — B O N E Y → position3=N? Positions: B,O,N,E,Y → position4=E—not position3=E? Wrong. Must be E at position3—here position3=N, position4=E.

Unless we consider no such word? 

Perhaps **ELUTE** — E L U T E → T banned and positions incorrect.

Another idea: **LENTO** — L E N T O → T banned and position3=N—not E.

List: ""annex"" — A and X—invalid.

""bonze"" — B O N Z E → positions：B,O,N,Z,E → position3=N—not E.

Position3=E required.

Perhaps ""incest"" — I,C banned—no.

""mince"" — M,I,C—banned? M banned? From Guess 3, M is absent? Yes, M is x.

So not.

Perhaps **PINED** — P I N E D → I banned—invalid.

**VINED** — V I N E D → I banned.

**WINED** — W I N E D → I banned.

**HONED** — has O banned? H O N E D — position3=N—not E.

Wait, isn't O not banned? Only C,R,A,S,T,I,M,Y banned—O is allowed.

But HONED: H O N E D → positions:1=H,2=O,3=N,4=E—position3=N not E.

Except if I misremember— the word must have position2=N, position3=E.

So for **HONEY**, that's position2=O, position3=N—not matching.

What word has position2=N and position3=E? 

For example: **INEPT** — I N E P T → position2=N, position3=E—yes! Letters: I,N,E,P,T—banned letters: I banned and T banned—invalid.

**UNWED** — U N W E D → position2=N, position3=W? Positions: U,N,W,E,D → position3=W, position4=E—not position3=E unless: position3 is W, not E.

Need position3=E.

**OPENED** more than 5.

Perhaps non-common words? Wordle uses common words usually.

Another: **ANGLE**— A banned.

**BINGE**— B I N G E → I banned and position not—position1=B,2=I,3=N—not E.

I need to consider fewer absent letters.

Perhaps E duplicated—but positionally fixed.

Example: **PENNE**: P E N N E → positions: P,E,N,N,E → position2=E, position3=N— not E at position3. Unless it's E at position1 and 5, position3=N? Not.

Position2=N required.

So words like: ""knell"" — K N E L L→ positions: K,N,E,L,L—yes! Position2=N, position3=E. Letters: K,N,E,L,L.

Banned? K,L not banned. Absent letters are C,R,A,S,T,I,M,Y—K and L are allowed.

Yes, KNELL is a valid word: the sound of a bell rung slowly.

Similarly, pattern fits: position1=K,2=N,3=E,4=L,5=L.

Also, avoids banned letters.

Another option: ""dwell"" — D W E L L→ position2=W? Not N—invalid pattern.

Or ""snell"" — S banned.

So KNELL: K N E L L

First letter K—not tested yet.

Position4=L, position5=L—double letters possible.

Provides good test.

But not sure about prevalence in Wordle.

Alternative: ""fennel"" — F E N N E L→ not 5 letters.

Another word: ""JENNY"" — J E N N Y → position2=E? Positions: J,E,N,N,Y — position2=E—not position2=N and position3=E? Position3=N—incorrect.

Unless ""jenny"" is J,E,N,N,Y—position1=J,2=E,3=N—not E at position3.

Doesn't match.

So KNELL seems valid.

Other possibilities: ""inner"" — I banned.

""biner"" — not common.

""caner"" — C and A banned.

Probably KNELL is acceptable.

To test more letters.

Another word: **DWELT** — D W E L T → T banned—invalid.

**OPENS** — S banned.

**QUEUE** — Q U E U E → positions: Q,U,E,U,E → position1=Q,2=U,3=E—yes! Position2=U? Not position2=N. Need position2=N.

In QUEUE, position2=U.

Pattern mismatch.

So KNELL or similar.

**LINEN** — L I N E N → I banned—invalid.

Focused: **KNEED** — K N E E D → positions: K,N,E,E,D—position3=E—yes. Pattern ?N E? — position1=K,2=N,3=E,4=E,5=D—letter4=E and letter5=D.

This works: K N E E D.

Letters: K,N,E,E,D—avoid banned? C,R,A,S,T,I,M,Y—none, so valid. ""KNEED"" means to bring knee to something.

Provides K and D new.

Similarly, ""BLEED"" has L—position not N.

So KNEED.

Compared to KNELL.

Both possible.

KNEED has E duplicated in position4? Not necessarily issue.

Guess KNEED: tests K and D.

If positions correct or partial.

Similarly, we have E at position3 and N position2.

In Guess 3, enemy had E at position1 marked wrong position—which might fit if E is at position4? But not necessarily.

So: propose KNEED.

Or for safety, choose KNOWN? K N O W N → position3=O—not E—invalid.

Must have E at position3.

So final choice: KNELL or KNEED.

Select KNEED—more common? 

Or KNELL.

Both valid.

Assume **KNELL**.

Thus guessed word: KNELL.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)
     - `C`, `R`, `A` are absent.
     - `N` and `E` are present but not in positions 4 or 5 (respectively).
   - **Guess 2 (""stein"")**: S(x), T(x), E(✓), I(x), N(-)
     - `S`, `T`, `I` are absent.
     - `E` is confirmed at position 3.
     - `N` is present but not in position 5.
   - **Guess 3 (""enemy"")**: E(-), N(✓), E(✓), M(x), Y(x)
     - `E` is present but not in position 1 (strengthens that `E` must be at position 3, and hints at possible duplication).
     - `N` is confirmed at position 2.
     - `M` and `Y` are absent.

2. **Consolidate Known Information**:
   - **Confirmed letters and positions**:
     - Position 2: `N` (fixed).
     - Position 3: `E` (fixed).
     - Secret word pattern: `[letter1] N E [letter4] [letter5]`.
   - **Absent letters**: `C`, `R`, `A`, `S`, `T`, `I`, `M`, `Y` (cannot appear).
   - **Present letters**: `N` (position 2), `E` (position 3), and at least one more instance of `E` may exist due to the `-` for position 1 in Guess 3.
   - **Unused letters**: Focus on high-frequency consonants/vowels not tested: `B`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `K`, `L`, `O`, `P`, `U`, `V`, `W`, `Z`.

3. **Deductions and Constraints**:
   - Position 1 cannot be `E` (per Guess 3 feedback: `E(-)` at position 1).
   - Positions 4–5 cannot repeat absent letters (`M`, `Y`, etc.).
   - Possible duplicates: `E` could appear elsewhere (e.g., position 4 or 5), as hinted by the `E(-)` in Guess 3.
   - Goal: Guess a word that fits the `? N E ? ?` pattern, includes untested letters, and probes positions 1, 4, and 5.

4. **Candidate Words**:
   - Prioritize words with common letters like `L`, `K`, `D`, or `O` to maximize information.
   - Examples:
     - `KNELL`: K N E L L (tests `K`, `L`; double `L`).
     - `KNEED`: K N E E D (tests `K`, `D`; double `E`).
     - `BONED`: B O N E D (invalid—position 3 is `N`, not `E`).
     - `UNDER`: U N D E R (invalid—`R` absent).
   - Strongest candidate: `KNELL` (valid English word, tests `K` and common `L`, avoids absent letters, and fits all constraints).

5. **Why `KNELL`?**:
   - Tests position 1 (`K`), positions 4 and 5 (`L`, `L`—double `L` possible).
   - Provides crucial feedback on `K` (if absent/present) and `L` positioning.
   - Aligns with pattern and expands coverage efficiently.

<guess>knell</guess>",knell,"After reviewing all feedback:

**Summary of Known Information:**
1. **Secret word contains**: 
   - E (present but not fixed everywhere, since Guess 1 showed E is present but not in position 5, and Guess 2 confirmed E is correctly in position 3). 
   - N (present, and Guess 3 shows N is correctly in position 2). 
2. **Confirmed positions**: 
   - Position 3: E (✓ from Guess 2 and 3) 
   - Position 2: N (✓ from Guess 3) 
3. **Constraints based on feedback**: 
   - E is not in position 5 (Guess 1) and not any other position besides position 3? But E is marked as '-' in position 1 of Guess 3, meaning E exists elsewhere—so E might be duplicated. Position 3 E is correct. Position 1 E is wrong position, so E must be present at least twice? 
   - N is in position 2. 
   - M and Y are absent (x in Guess 3). 
4. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, S, T, I, M, Y. 
   This significantly reduces the alphabet. 
   Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, P, U, V, W, Z, etc.

**Breaking down the pattern:** 
- Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 
- We know: position 2 is N, position 3 is E. 
- So pattern: _ N E _ _ 
- From Guess 3: enemy gave E at position 1: marked as '-' meaning E is present but not in position 1. Therefore, since E is confirmed at position 3, the '-' for E in position 1 implies there's at least one other E elsewhere? Or it could be referring to position 3? No—the feedback per position: position 1 E is marked '-', meaning that the letter E is in the word but should not be in position 1. Similarly, position 3 E is marked '✓', so it's correctly placed. 
Therefore, there must be at least one more E in the word besides position 3—because E at position 1 is absent but E is present elsewhere? The '-' indicates E is in the word but not in position 1. Since E is already fixed at position 3, the '-' reinforces that E exists and that position 1 is incorrect, which we already know from position 3. But '-' for a letter implies the letter is present, but in a different position. Therefore, if E is marked '-' at position 1, and we know E is at position 3, this could mean either:
  - There is only one E (at position 3), and the '-' at position 1 just tells us E exists and position 1 is wrong—which is consistent—or...
  - There are multiple E's, and the '-' at position 1 indicates E is present elsewhere beyond position 3. 

But regardless, the '-' doesn't necessarily imply duplication; it only indicates the letter exists but not here. Since position 3 is confirmed E, the '-' at position 1 doesn't require a duplicate—it just confirms E is somewhere else (which is position 3). But it doesn't provide new info beyond confirming E is present and not in position 1. 

Similarly, N at position 2 is correct ✓.

So pattern: position 2 = N, position 3 = E → word is _ N E _ _ 

Additionally, from Guess 3: 
- Position 1 E: '-' → E is present, but not here (could be position 3).
- Position 4 M: x → M absent
- Position 5 Y: x → Y absent

**Deductions:**
- Secret word format: exactly: [letter1] N E [letter4] [letter5]
- Letter1 cannot be E (since E was guessed in position 1 and marked '-'). But E might be duplicated? The '-' doesn't prevent E in other positions except 1? 

But E is confirmed only at position 3 so far. 

Could letter1 be E? No—if E were in position 1, it should be marked accordingly; here, it was marked '-', meaning E is in the word but not position 1. Since E at position 3 is ✓, so position 1 cannot be E. 

Similarly, letter4 and letter5 must differ from M and Y.

Now, letters to exclude: C,R,A,S,T,I,M,Y.
Possible letters for positions 1,4,5: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,O,P,U,V,W,Z

Additionally, since E might be repeated? We need to consider—word might have duplicate E? Not necessarily—but from feedback, position 1 E marked '-' only tells us E is not at position 1 and exists. 

Therefore, possibilities:
- If there's another E beyond position 3, it must be in position 4 or 5? Or not? Positions 4 and 5 are available.

Looking for English words with pattern _ N E _ _ avoiding C,R,A,S,T,I,M,Y.

Common examples:
- **UNLED**? Not common.
- **ONELL**? Not words.

Better: 
- **INLAY** — I absent
- **BLEED** — B L E E D → pattern not _ N E _, incorrect—must have N at position2 and E at position3.

So ? N E ? ?

Possible words:
- **ANKER** — A absent
- **ENDED** — E N D E D → positions: position1:E (but E cannot be position1? From feedback, Guess 3 has E at position1 marked '-', meaning E should not be in position1. Therefore ENDED would have E at position1—invalid for guess. Similarly, for the secret word if E is at position1, but why mark it as wrong position? Contradiction? The secret word cannot have E at position1 because Guess tried E at position1 and was told it's not correct. Therefore, in secret word, position1 must NOT be E.

Therefore, secret word pattern: letter1 ≠ E, letter2=N, letter3=E.

Similarly, letters 4 and 5 ≠ M,Y.

Words: 
- **UNDER** — U N D E R → but R is absent? R banned? Guess 1 banned R, so R absent—cannot have R.
- **DINED** — D I N E D → I absent—invalid.
- **FONDU** — F O N D U → not pattern — position3=N, not E? Must be E at position3.

Need E at position3 explicitly.

**HONED** — H O N E D → positions: H,O,N,E,D → position3=N? Not E—wrong.
Position sequence: position1=H,2=O,3=N,4=E—position4=E, not position3.

Must have position3=E—fixed.

So pattern: ? N E ? ?

So letters at1: something, at2=N, at3=E, at4: something, at5:something.

Avoiding banned letters: C,R,A,S,T,I,M,Y banned.

Possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,O,P,U,V,W,Z

Words: 
- **GIVEN** — G I V E N → I banned—invalid
- **BAKED** — B A K E D → A banned—invalid
- **LUNGE** — L U N G E → pattern: positions1=L,2=U,3=N,4=G,5=E—not E at position3? Wrong unless: L U N G E has position3=N—not E.

Position3 must be E—so sequence after position2=N must be E at position3.

So examples:
- **KNELT**: K N E L T → T banned? T absent—invalid
- **SNEAK**: S banned—invalid
- **BLEED**: B L E E D → position2=L? Not N—wrong pattern.

I am missing—_ N E _ _

Like **ONEAR**? Not valid.

Perhaps **DONEE**? Not common.

Using letters: B, O, K, D, etc.

**BONED** — B O N E D → positions: B,O,N,E,D → position4=E? Position3=N—not E.

Position3 must be E—so N must be position2 and E position3.

**TOKEN** — T banned.

**WOMEN** — W O M E N → position4=E? Positions: W,O,M,E,N → position3=M—not E.

Except **QUEEN**: Q U E E N → positions: Q,U,E,E,N → position3=E? Position1=Q,2=U,3=E,4=E,5=N → indeed position3=E! Also position4=E? And letters: Q,U,E,E,N.

Now banned letters: C,R,A,S,T,I,M,Y—Q,U,N are OK? Yes.

Q is valid—uncommon but possible.

Avoided? Yes.

Similarly, **EJECT** — has banned T and C—invalid.

So QUEEN is possible.

Other options: **BEVEL** — position not.

**INLET** — T and I banned.

Another: **OUNCE** — O U N C E → position3=N—not E.

**FREED** — F R E E D → R banned—invalid.

**GREET** — R and T banned.

Back to QUEEN: pattern ? N E ? → Q U E E N matches positions: position1=Q? No, position1=Q, but our pattern is position2=N? QUEEN has position1=Q,2=U,3=E—position2=U, not N.

Misalignment: QUEEN has positions: Q,U,E,E,N—so position2 is U, position3 is E—it does not have position2=N. But our secret has position2=N fixed.

Therefore QUEEN does not match because position2 is U, whereas we need position2=N.

Confusion. Pattern is fixed: position2=N, position3=E.

So QUEEN has position3=E but position2=U ≠ N.

So invalid for this constraint.

Must have position2=N.

Therefore, words with pattern: [Position1] N E [Position4] [Position5]

Position1 ≠ E (from feedback)

Letters 4 and 5 not M,Y.

Possible words:
- **UNDID** — U N D I D → I banned—invalid
- **BONEY** — B O N E Y → position3=N? Positions: B,O,N,E,Y → position4=E—not position3=E? Wrong. Must be E at position3—here position3=N, position4=E.

Unless we consider no such word? 

Perhaps **ELUTE** — E L U T E → T banned and positions incorrect.

Another idea: **LENTO** — L E N T O → T banned and position3=N—not E.

List: ""annex"" — A and X—invalid.

""bonze"" — B O N Z E → positions：B,O,N,Z,E → position3=N—not E.

Position3=E required.

Perhaps ""incest"" — I,C banned—no.

""mince"" — M,I,C—banned? M banned? From Guess 3, M is absent? Yes, M is x.

So not.

Perhaps **PINED** — P I N E D → I banned—invalid.

**VINED** — V I N E D → I banned.

**WINED** — W I N E D → I banned.

**HONED** — has O banned? H O N E D — position3=N—not E.

Wait, isn't O not banned? Only C,R,A,S,T,I,M,Y banned—O is allowed.

But HONED: H O N E D → positions:1=H,2=O,3=N,4=E—position3=N not E.

Except if I misremember— the word must have position2=N, position3=E.

So for **HONEY**, that's position2=O, position3=N—not matching.

What word has position2=N and position3=E? 

For example: **INEPT** — I N E P T → position2=N, position3=E—yes! Letters: I,N,E,P,T—banned letters: I banned and T banned—invalid.

**UNWED** — U N W E D → position2=N, position3=W? Positions: U,N,W,E,D → position3=W, position4=E—not position3=E unless: position3 is W, not E.

Need position3=E.

**OPENED** more than 5.

Perhaps non-common words? Wordle uses common words usually.

Another: **ANGLE**— A banned.

**BINGE**— B I N G E → I banned and position not—position1=B,2=I,3=N—not E.

I need to consider fewer absent letters.

Perhaps E duplicated—but positionally fixed.

Example: **PENNE**: P E N N E → positions: P,E,N,N,E → position2=E, position3=N— not E at position3. Unless it's E at position1 and 5, position3=N? Not.

Position2=N required.

So words like: ""knell"" — K N E L L→ positions: K,N,E,L,L—yes! Position2=N, position3=E. Letters: K,N,E,L,L.

Banned? K,L not banned. Absent letters are C,R,A,S,T,I,M,Y—K and L are allowed.

Yes, KNELL is a valid word: the sound of a bell rung slowly.

Similarly, pattern fits: position1=K,2=N,3=E,4=L,5=L.

Also, avoids banned letters.

Another option: ""dwell"" — D W E L L→ position2=W? Not N—invalid pattern.

Or ""snell"" — S banned.

So KNELL: K N E L L

First letter K—not tested yet.

Position4=L, position5=L—double letters possible.

Provides good test.

But not sure about prevalence in Wordle.

Alternative: ""fennel"" — F E N N E L→ not 5 letters.

Another word: ""JENNY"" — J E N N Y → position2=E? Positions: J,E,N,N,Y — position2=E—not position2=N and position3=E? Position3=N—incorrect.

Unless ""jenny"" is J,E,N,N,Y—position1=J,2=E,3=N—not E at position3.

Doesn't match.

So KNELL seems valid.

Other possibilities: ""inner"" — I banned.

""biner"" — not common.

""caner"" — C and A banned.

Probably KNELL is acceptable.

To test more letters.

Another word: **DWELT** — D W E L T → T banned—invalid.

**OPENS** — S banned.

**QUEUE** — Q U E U E → positions: Q,U,E,U,E → position1=Q,2=U,3=E—yes! Position2=U? Not position2=N. Need position2=N.

In QUEUE, position2=U.

Pattern mismatch.

So KNELL or similar.

**LINEN** — L I N E N → I banned—invalid.

Focused: **KNEED** — K N E E D → positions: K,N,E,E,D—position3=E—yes. Pattern ?N E? — position1=K,2=N,3=E,4=E,5=D—letter4=E and letter5=D.

This works: K N E E D.

Letters: K,N,E,E,D—avoid banned? C,R,A,S,T,I,M,Y—none, so valid. ""KNEED"" means to bring knee to something.

Provides K and D new.

Similarly, ""BLEED"" has L—position not N.

So KNEED.

Compared to KNELL.

Both possible.

KNEED has E duplicated in position4? Not necessarily issue.

Guess KNEED: tests K and D.

If positions correct or partial.

Similarly, we have E at position3 and N position2.

In Guess 3, enemy had E at position1 marked wrong position—which might fit if E is at position4? But not necessarily.

So: propose KNEED.

Or for safety, choose KNOWN? K N O W N → position3=O—not E—invalid.

Must have E at position3.

So final choice: KNELL or KNEED.

Select KNEED—more common? 

Or KNELL.

Both valid.

Assume **KNELL**.

Thus guessed word: KNELL.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)
     - `C`, `R`, `A` are absent.
     - `N` and `E` are present but not in positions 4 or 5 (respectively).
   - **Guess 2 (""stein"")**: S(x), T(x), E(✓), I(x), N(-)
     - `S`, `T`, `I` are absent.
     - `E` is confirmed at position 3.
     - `N` is present but not in position 5.
   - **Guess 3 (""enemy"")**: E(-), N(✓), E(✓), M(x), Y(x)
     - `E` is present but not in position 1 (strengthens that `E` must be at position 3, and hints at possible duplication).
     - `N` is confirmed at position 2.
     - `M` and `Y` are absent.

2. **Consolidate Known Information**:
   - **Confirmed letters and positions**:
     - Position 2: `N` (fixed).
     - Position 3: `E` (fixed).
     - Secret word pattern: `[letter1] N E [letter4] [letter5]`.
   - **Absent letters**: `C`, `R`, `A`, `S`, `T`, `I`, `M`, `Y` (cannot appear).
   - **Present letters**: `N` (position 2), `E` (position 3), and at least one more instance of `E` may exist due to the `-` for position 1 in Guess 3.
   - **Unused letters**: Focus on high-frequency consonants/vowels not tested: `B`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `K`, `L`, `O`, `P`, `U`, `V`, `W`, `Z`.

3. **Deductions and Constraints**:
   - Position 1 cannot be `E` (per Guess 3 feedback: `E(-)` at position 1).
   - Positions 4–5 cannot repeat absent letters (`M`, `Y`, etc.).
   - Possible duplicates: `E` could appear elsewhere (e.g., position 4 or 5), as hinted by the `E(-)` in Guess 3.
   - Goal: Guess a word that fits the `? N E ? ?` pattern, includes untested letters, and probes positions 1, 4, and 5.

4. **Candidate Words**:
   - Prioritize words with common letters like `L`, `K`, `D`, or `O` to maximize information.
   - Examples:
     - `KNELL`: K N E L L (tests `K`, `L`; double `L`).
     - `KNEED`: K N E E D (tests `K`, `D`; double `E`).
     - `BONED`: B O N E D (invalid—position 3 is `N`, not `E`).
     - `UNDER`: U N D E R (invalid—`R` absent).
   - Strongest candidate: `KNELL` (valid English word, tests `K` and common `L`, avoids absent letters, and fits all constraints).

5. **Why `KNELL`?**:
   - Tests position 1 (`K`), positions 4 and 5 (`L`, `L`—double `L` possible).
   - Provides crucial feedback on `K` (if absent/present) and `L` positioning.
   - Aligns with pattern and expands coverage efficiently.",Guess 4: knell -> FEEDBACK: K(✓) N(✓) E(✓) L(x) L(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Hmm, the user is asking me to make my first 5-letter word guess in the Wordle-like game. Since it's the first guess, I need to choose a word strategically to maximize information gathering.  

The most effective opening words usually contain common letters and a balanced vowel-consonant distribution. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROATE"" are popular among players because they cover frequent letters (R, S, T, L, E) and vowels (A, E, O).  

Testing vowel distribution might be wise since vowels are critical in English words. A word with multiple vowels could quickly narrow down possibilities. Let me consider ""ADIEU"" – it covers four vowels (A, E, I, U) but lacks consonant coverage. Alternatively, ""CRANE"" feels better: it has two vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N), plus it's from the original Wordle solutions list.  

""SOARE"" is another strong contender (birds are common in Wordle), but I recall the user's rules don't specify using only solution words – just valid English words. Still, ""CRANE"" seems safer.  

Final choice: ""CRANE"" gives me ✓/- feedback for C, R, A, N, E positions while covering statistically useful letters. It's a textbook opener.  

Now, to respond: I'll start with reasoning in `<thinking>` (though hidden per format), then output `<guess>crane</guess>`.Based on Wordle strategy principles, an effective first guess should:  
1. Include a mix of common vowels (e.g., A, E) and consonants (e.g., R, S, T, N),  
2. Avoid repeating letters to maximize coverage.  

The word **CRANE** is a strong opener because it:  
- Contains 3 common consonants (C, R, N) and 2 vowels (A, E),  
- Tests letters frequently appearing in 5-letter words,  
- Provides early positioning clues for versatile letters like R.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let me process the feedback from the first guess. I guessed ""CRANE"" and got quite a lot of information from it:

- C, R, A are all marked as ""x"", meaning none of these letters appear in the secret word at all. That immediately eliminates a big chunk of possibilities.
- N and E are marked as ""-"", so both N and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions I guessed them in.

Breaking this down:

1. **Letters to exclude:** C, R, A are completely out. That's significant because R and A are very common letters. The secret word must avoid these entirely.
2. **Letters to include:** Both N and E must be in the word somewhere, but:
   - N is not in the 4th position (since I guessed it there and it's wrong position).
   - E is not in the 5th position (since I guessed it there and it's wrong position).

So the secret word:
- Contains N and E
- Excludes C, R, A
- Is 5 letters long

Now, I need a new guess that incorporates these constraints:
- Must include N and E (but not in positions 4 or 5 respectively)
- Must exclude C, R, A
- Should test new letters to gather more information

Since N and E are confirmed in the word, I'll prioritize keeping them in my next guess but in different positions to test their real locations. I'll also introduce new common letters since C/R/A are out—good candidates would be T, O, S, L, M, etc.

Possible approach:
1. **Reposition N:** Since N wasn't in position 4, I could try it in position 2, 3, or 5.
2. **Reposition E:** Since E wasn't in position 5, I could move it to position 1, 2, or 3.
3. **New letters:** Test other common letters like T, O, S, L, etc.

I should avoid positions where we already ruled them out, though:

- Since N was eliminated from position 4, I can place it in 1,2,3, or 5, but caution: position 5 was originally E's spot which might conflict if I put N there. Similarly, E can't be in position 5 so I have to avoid that placement.

Given E is highly likely to be somewhere in positions 1-4, and N cannot be in position 4.

Good second guesses should maximize information:
- Keep N and E to verify their positions
- Use fresh high-frequency letters: S, T, L, O, M, D, etc.

Considering possible words that fit:
- Must include N and E
- Exclude C, R, A

For example:
- Words like **STONE**, **STEIN**, **LEMON**, **MEANT**, **SPINE**
  
Now evaluating each:
- **STONE**: S T O N E → Tests S,T,O (new), keeps N/E but moves them (N to position 4 was bad, but I'm trying position 4 again? Wait, the feedback said N was present but not in position 4—so placing it in position 4 again is useless. I should move N to a new spot to test its real location.)
  
Better alternatives where N and E shift positions:
- **MEANT**: M E A N T → But A is excluded! Invalid, since A is ruled out.
- **SPINE**: S P I N E → This is better. Places E in position 5? But E cannot be in position 5 per feedback. So invalid placement.
  
Ah, constraint: E cannot be in position 5. So any candidate must place E in positions 1-4 and N not in position 4.

Good options:
- **N** can be in positions 1,2,3,5
- **E** can be in 1,2,3,4
  
Look for words featuring N and E while avoiding positions that are forbidden AND excluding C,R,A.

Strong candidate: **STEIN** (S,T,E,I,N)
- It places E in position 3 (avoiding position 5)
- Places N in position 5 (since position 4 was bad, trying a new spot)
- Tests S,T,I (new letters)
- Avoids C,R,A

Another option: **TOKEN** (T,O,K,E,N) but O and K might be less common.

**STEIN** seems solid:
- Gives chance to confirm positions of E (pos3) and N (pos5). If either lights up as ""✓"", we've nailed them. If ""-"", we know they're elsewhere but still in the word.

Alternatively, **LINES** (L,I,N,E,S) — but N in position 3 (which might be fine), E in 4. Avoids position 4 for N? Yes. Also avoids E in position 5.

But **LINES** ends with S. That might be okay since S is common. However, starting with L tests a less frequent letter? Not crucial—S,T are higher frequency anyway.

Comparing:
**STEIN**: Tests S,T,E,I,N with E in position 3 and N in position 5—new positions for both ruled-out placements.

**LINES**: N in position 3 (new), E in position 4 (also new position for E). This is fairly equivalent too.

I'll select **STEIN** since T and S feel slightly more common than L and I. Plus “stein” is a familiar word.

Therefore, next guess: STEIN

Let me validate:
- Includes N and E
- Avoids C,R,A
- Repositions both (E not in 5th, N not in 4th)
- Tests S,T,I—high-value consonants.

Seems strategically sound.Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (""CRANE"" → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)):  
- **C, R, A** are **completely absent** from the secret word.  
- **N and E** are **present**, but **not in position 4** (for N) or **position 5** (for E).  

For the next guess:  
- Must include **N and E** (with N not in position 4; E not in position 5).  
- Must exclude C, R, A.  
- To maximize information, focus on **high-frequency letters** (e.g., S, T, L, O) and reposition N/E to untested spots.  

I chose **STEIN**:  
- Tests S/T/I (new common letters) while retaining N/E in new positions (E in position 3; N in position 5).  
- Avoids C/R/A entirely.  
- Efficiently probes E/N positions and expands letter coverage.

<guess>stein</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(✓) I(x) N(-)
<｜Assistant｜>After reviewing the feedback from the first two guesses:

From Guess 1 (""crane""): 
- C, R, A are absent (x)
- N is present but not in position 4 (-)
- E is present but not in position 5 (-)

From Guess 2 (""stein""):
- S and T are absent (x)
- E is correct and in position 3 (✓)  [since it was the third letter]
- I is absent (x)
- N is present but not in position 5 (-)  [since it was guessed in position 5]

Current deductions:
- **Secret word contains**: E (fixed in position 3) and N (somewhere, but not position 4 or 5). From ""crane"", E was present but not in position 5. Now E is fixed at position 3.

- **Letters confirmed absent**: C, R, A, S, T, I.

- **Position constraints**:
  - Position 3 is E (fixed from ""stein"" feedback).
  - N is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (since it was misplaced there in past guesses).
    - So N must be in position 1 or 2.

Now expanding:
- Secret word pattern: _ _ E _ _ 
- Position 1 or 2 must be N.

We also need additional letters that haven't been tested yet. Letters tested so far: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, I. Absentees: C, R, A, S, T, I.

Remaining letters to test: Common consonants/vowels like B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, possibly others.

We know:
- Word: ? ? E ? ? 
- N is in position 1 or 2.

Given the absence of many common letters, the secret word likely uses less frequent letters. We should prioritize:
- Confirming N's position: try it in position 1 or 2.
- Testing new high-frequency letters: L, O, D, M, etc.

Possible words that fit:
- Structure: N E ? ? ? or ? N E ? ? 

But E is fixed as the third character, so it's actually [letter1] [letter2] E [letter4] [letter5]

And N must be letter1 or letter2.

Case 1: N is in position 1 → N _ E _ _
Case 2: N is in position 2 → _ N E _ _

We need a valid English word satisfying:
- Does not contain C, R, A, S, T, I
- Contains N (in 1 or 2)
- Contains E (in position 3)
- The other letters are unknown.

Possible examples:
For ""N _ E _ _"": Possible words: NEWER? But W is untested. NEWER contains E at position 3? N E W E R → position3 is W, not E? Wait no—""NEWER"" is N E W E R → position 3 is W. So incorrect.

Need position 3 to be E.

Another: NEEDY → N E E D Y → position3 is E? Position3 is E (second E). Okay ""NEEDY"" has N position1, E position2, E position3? But our guess requires position3 to be E—""NEEDY"" has E at position2 and 3. But we know from feedback that E is only confirmed at position3, not whether there's another E.

Actually, ""steine"" had E at position3, and it was marked correct. So position3 must be E, but other E's could exist? Not forbidden yet.

Similarly, ""crane"" had E at position5 marked absent? No feedback: E was misplaced (wrong position) in ""crane""—it was guessed in position5. That doesn't preclude E elsewhere. But in ""stein"", E position3 was ✓, so position3 is definitely E.

Now, looking for words with E in position3 and starting with N or second letter N.

Possible words:
- If position1 is N: N ? E ? ? → e.g., NODES? But S is absent, invalid. Similarly NAKED? A absent.

Avoiding absentees: C,R,A,S,T,I are out.

Options:
- For N in position1: Words like NEEDY → N E E D Y → positions: 1:N, 2:E, 3:E (but E at position3 is fixed—yes), 4:D, 5:Y
  - Does ""NEEDY"" work? Position3 is E—good.
  - Letters: N,E,E,D,Y → we know E is allowed, N is in, D and Y untested, and note the double-E. Can we have multiple E's? The feedback from ""stein"" about E didn't specify if it's the only E—it just marked position3 as correct and didn't comment on other positions.
  - However, ""NEEDY"" contains E at position2 as well—but position2 is not yet confirmed. So possible—no contradiction.
  - Also, absent letters: avoiding C,R,A,S,T,I—yes.
- Alternatively, NEIGH → N E I G H → I is absent! Forbidden.
- NOMEN: Too obscure, and O,E,M,N → O and M untested.

For position2 is N: _ N E _ _

Words like SNORE? S absent—invalid.
MONEY → M O N E Y → Position2:N (yes), position3:E? Position3 is N—wait: ""MONEY"" letters: M O N E Y → positions:1:M, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:Y → but we have position3 must be E, not N. Incorrect.

Correct pattern: position3 is E.

So ""MONEY"" is M O N E Y → position3=N, not E. Wrong.

Another try: word like ""HONEY"" — H O N E Y → position1:H, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E → position3 is N—not E.

I need something like _ N E _ _ → so character2=N, character3=E.

Examples: INEPT? I absent—invalid.
ONCER? O absent? No, O present? Let's list words: AGNES? A absent. So avoiding absentees.

Possible words:
- **UNMET**: U N M E T → positions:1:U, position2:N, position3:M? Position3 is M—not E. Wrong.
Structure must be letter1, then N at position2, then E at position3.

So: ? N E ? ?

Valid words: 
- **ANKER**: A absent—invalid.
- But avoiding C,R,A,S,T,I—so consider letters like O, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

**BUNCH**: B U N C H → position2=N? Positions:1:B, 2:U, 3:N—not E. Wrong.

Need position3=E specifically.

So "" ? N E ? ?"" meaning:
Position1: some letter (call it X)
Position2: N
Position3: E
Position4: Y
Position5: Z

So word = [X] N E [Y] [Z]

Valid example: **ANGUS** — But G and U present? A is absent? ANGUS has A—invalid.

Another: **INKER** — I absent.

**OUNCE** — O U N C E → position1:O, 2:U, 3:N—not E.

I'm struggling. Look for English words ending with ""ENE"" or something? But position3=E, so not ending.

Common words: like ""BYNTE"" not a word.

Perhaps **LINED** — L I N E D → position3=N? Position sequence: L,I,N,E,D → position3=N, position4=E. But we need position3=E. So no.

Another thought: what about ""QUEEN"" — Q U E E N → position3=E—yes! Letters: Q,U,E,E,N. Position3=E—good. But Q? And E at position4 also.

""QUEEN"" — positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E (good), 4:E, 5:N. Now, letters: Q,U,E,E,N.

Absentees: no C,R,A,S,T,I—Q and U are untested. Valid? Q is less common but legitimate.

Alternatives: **GIVEN** — G I V E N → position3=V? Positions: G,I,V,E,N → position3=V, not E.

Need position3=E.

**HAVEN** — H A V E N → position4=E? Positions: H,A,V,E,N → position4=E. Not.

Must have pattern: either N in position1 with E at 3: like NEEDY, NEEFL? Not, NEEDY as above (NEEDY: N,E,E,D,Y → position3=E).

Other words with N position1 and E position3: 
- **NEWEL**: N E W E L → position3=W? Positions: N,E,W,E,L → position2=E, position3=W—not E. Wrong unless second letter is E? No.

NE?E? words: like NEARS? S absent and A absent.

Focusing: for ""N _ E _ _"": 
NEEDS: S absent.
NEIGH: I absent.
NERDS: R absent.
NEXUS: X not tested, but S absent? S banned.

With avoiding S and others: NEPER? E P E R → R absent.

Not many common ones. 

Perhaps N position2: word pattern ? N E ? ?

Like ""PUNCH"": P U N C H → position3=N? Not E.

Position3=E: so sequence after N must be E in the third position.

Possible words: 
- KNEEP: K N E E P → positions: K,N,E,E,P → position3=E—yes. Letters: K,N,E,E,P. Avoids absentees? C,R,A,S,T,I absent? Yes, K,N,E,E,P — N and E confirmed, K and P new.

Valid word? ""KNEEP"" might not be common—check dictionary? Assuming Wordle accepts variant, but let's see alternatives.

**LYNED**: Not common.

**OWNED**: O W N E D → positions: O,W,N,E,D → position3=N? Position sequence: position1:O,2:W,3:N,position4=E—not E at 3.

**UNTIE**: U N T I E → position5=E? Position sequence: U,N,T,I,E → positions:1:U,2:N,3:T,4:I,5:E—position3=T, not E. And T and I absent—invalid.

Another idea: **UNWED**: U N W E D → position4=E? Positions: U,N,W,E,D → position3=W, position4=E—not E at 3.

Correcting: to satisfy position3=E, possible word? 

Examples like ""ANODE"" — A absent.

""INNER""—I absent.

""ENEMY""—E position1, N position2, E position3—yes: E N E M Y → avoiding absentees? Letters: E,N,E,M,Y—no C,R,A,S,T,I? OK. But is E position1 allowed? We don't know yet. Constraints only on N and E positions, not prohibiting E elsewhere.

So ""ENEMY"": positions:1:E, 2:N, 3:E, 4:M, 5:Y—position3=E—good. Also N at position2—so N is not in positions 4 or 5, which matches.

Similarly, ""MINED""—I absent—invalid.

So ""ENEMY"" seems valid: 
- E at position1 — untested? Could be present or not.
- N at position2 — we know N must be somewhere, here position2—possible.
- E at position3 — fixed ✓.
- M and Y new.

If ""ENEMY"" is the word, but we need to confirm.

Another word: **ONCER**—O N C E R: C and R absent—invalid.

Back to Case 1: N position1: e.g., NEEDY.

From feedback, ""stein"" had E at position3 correct and N present but not position5.

In NEEDY: N position1, E position2 and 3, etc.

Could be.

But ENEMY has N position2.

To maximize information:
- Guess NEEDY to test N in position1 and double-E possibility.
- Or ENEMY to test N in position2 and new letters.

But we have only 6 tries, so need efficient.

Since E is fixed at position3, and N must be in 1 or 2, I can choose a word that:
- Places N in position 1 (to test Case 1)
- Or position2 (Case 2)

If I place N in position1, and if it's position1 is ✓ in reality, I get info.

Similarly for position2.

Either way, I'll cover.

Choose common letters: L, O, K, etc.

Option: **NEVER**—E and R? R absent—invalid.

**LEVEL**—L,E,V,E,L → position1:L,2:E,3:V—position3=V? Not E—unless.

Must be E at position3.

Another: **BELIE**—B E L I E → position3=L? Not E.

Difficult to find words.

**OUNCE**—not.

Or **BEVEL**—B E V E L, position3=V? Not E.

Perhaps uncommon words? Wordle usually uses common words.

List: 
For pattern ""? N E ? ?"": 
- **ANGEL**: A absent—no
- **ENGED**? Not a word.
- **INKED**—I absent.
- **OKNED**? No.

Better to think of common words.

**LONGE**: L O N G E → positions: L,O,N,G,E → position3=N, not E—unless: word ""Longe"" not common.

Alternate: **HONEY** — position3=N, not E.

Perhaps ""CHIEF"" not, position varies.

Another try: position3=E, position2=N → words ending with N E? But not.

So possible words: ""DIENED"" not 5 letters.

Accept that double-E might be possible? Or other.

""NEEDS"": S absent—invalid.

""NEIGH"": I absent.

So rare with avoided letters.

Perhaps N position1: pattern N ? E ? ? 

Examples: NEEDS — invalid.
NERVED: R absent.
NUKED: U,K,E,D — N at1, E at3: N U K E D → positions: N,U,K,E,D — position3=K, position4=E? Not E at3—position3 must be K? Wrong.

Except if second letter allows E? Like NE E something.

Specifically N E E ? ? → NEED? But D — possible, NEED is 5-letter? Need is 4? NEEDY as I thought.

NEEDY is valid: N E E D Y -> positions:1:N,2:E,3:E,4:D,5:Y

Yes, NEEDY is a valid word: lacking in money; poor.

Similarly, NEWER: N E W E R -> positions:1:N,2:E,3:W,4:E—position3=W not E. Invalid for position3.

So NEEDY works for pattern: position1:N, position2:E, position3:E, etc. Position3 is E—good. Also contains E at position2.

Now, we haven't ruled out multiple E's, so it's possible.

Next option: ENEMY (E N E M Y).

Both are plausible.

To choose between NEEDY and ENEMY.

NEEDY tests N in position1.
ENEMY tests N in position2.

Also, NEEDY has D and Y, ENEMY has M and Y.

Since both contain E at position2—in NEEDY position2=E and ENEMY position1=E—but position1=E is not confirmed.

For information:
If I guess ENEMY, and if N is indeed in position2, then I might get ✓ for N position2. If not, it might be marked - or X—but we know N is present.

Similarly for NEEDY: position1=N, which is a possible location.

Given that S is absent, T absent, etc. Prioritize testing N position.

I could guess a word with N in position1 and new letters.

Or since ENEMY also tests position1=E, which wasn't tested before.

ENEMY has advantages: tests E at position1 (possible), N at position2 (possible).

Whereas NEEDY has E at position2 again—but if secret has only one E, it might be weird, but possible.

Both work.

Choose ENEMY? Or for new letters like O.

Other possibilities: **BEIGY** — not, position vary.

**GUESSED** not.

Decide on ENEMY.

But let's see feedback implied: in ""crane"", E was marked - meaning present but not position5. Now with E at position3 fixed.

Guess: ENEMY

If secret is ENEMY, feedback: E at position1? Unknown, N position2? Could be -, E position3 ✓, M position4? Unknown, Y position5 unknown.

Similarly, if NEEDY, N position1 possible.

But ENEMY also tests M and Y—useful.

Another option: **OPENS** — contains S absent—no.

**YANKS** — A absent.

I am considering **KENDO** — K E N D O → position3=N, not E—invalid.

So back. 

Another word: **BEGIN** — G I N — positions: B,E,G,I,N → position2=E, position3=G—not E.

Must have E at position3.

Perhaps ""THREE"" — T H R E E → R absent and position4=E.

Not.

I think ENEMY is acceptable.

Or NEEDY.

But to test more common letters: NEEDY uses D and Y, ENEMY uses M and Y.

M is less common than L, O? Probably fine.

Going with ENEMY, as it positions N at2—untested spot.

Similarly, we haven't tested position1 at all—in both guesses, position1 was C then S, both absent.

Position1 could be many things.

So ENEMY is a valid guess.

Therefore, next guess: ENEMY

Check constraints:
- Position3:E ✓
- N must be present, not in position4 or5—here position2, good.
- Excluded letters: C,R,A,S,T,I—none in ENEMY.### Deductive Reasoning Steps:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:  
   - Guess 1 (""crane""): C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)  
     - Letters `C`, `R`, `A` are **absent** from the secret word.  
     - `N` is present but **not in position 4**.  
     - `E` is present but **not in position 5**.  
   - Guess 2 (""stein""): S(x), T(x), E(✓), I(x), N(-)  
     - Letters `S`, `T`, `I` are **absent**.  
     - `E` is confirmed in **position 3** (correct placement).  
     - `N` is present but **not in position 5**.  

2. **Confirm Known Letters**:  
   - `E` is fixed at **position 3** of the secret word.  
   - `N` is present but excluded from positions 4 and 5 (from Guess 1 and Guess 2 feedback). Thus, `N` must be in **position 1 or 2**.  
   - Absent letters: `C`, `R`, `A`, `S`, `T`, `I` cannot appear.  

3. **Deduce Word Pattern**:  
   - Secret pattern: `[position1] [position2] E [position4] [position5]`.  
   - Position 1 or 2 must be `N`.  
   - Untested positions: 1, 2, 4, and 5 need new letters.  

4. **Prioritize Next Guess Goals**:  
   - Test `N`'s position (1 or 2) and cover new high-frequency letters.  
   - Use only untested letters: Avoid `C,R,A,S,T,I`; prioritize common consonants/vowels like `M`, `Y`, `L`, `O`, `D`, `H`.  
   - Reposition `N` to an untested spot (either position 1 or 2) while keeping `E` fixed at position 3.  

5. **Candidate Words**:  
   - **Option 1: `N` in position 1** (e.g., `NEEDY`).  
     - Pattern: `N E E D Y`. Tests position 1 for `N` and new letters `D`, `Y`. Double `E` possible.  
     - Concerns: `E` at position 2 may conflict if no duplicate `E`, but feedback hasn't ruled this out.  
   - **Option 2: `N` in position 2** (e.g., `ENEMY`).  
     - Pattern: `E N E M Y`. Tests position 2 for `N`, position 1 for `E` (possible duplication), and new letters `M`, `Y`.  
   - Final choice: `ENEMY` is stronger:  
     - Tests `N` position 2 (untested location).  
     - Efficiently probes multiple constraints: `N` displacement, `E` duplication (positions 1 and 3), and uses common letters (`M`, `Y`).  
     - Avoids all excluded letters.  

6. **Word Validity**:  
   - `ENEMY` is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning ""hostile entity"" or adversary).

<guess>enemy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(✓) I(x) N(-)
Guess 3: enemy -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(✓) E(✓) M(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>After reviewing all feedback:

**Summary of Known Information:**
1. **Secret word contains**: 
   - E (present but not fixed everywhere, since Guess 1 showed E is present but not in position 5, and Guess 2 confirmed E is correctly in position 3). 
   - N (present, and Guess 3 shows N is correctly in position 2). 
2. **Confirmed positions**: 
   - Position 3: E (✓ from Guess 2 and 3) 
   - Position 2: N (✓ from Guess 3) 
3. **Constraints based on feedback**: 
   - E is not in position 5 (Guess 1) and not any other position besides position 3? But E is marked as '-' in position 1 of Guess 3, meaning E exists elsewhere—so E might be duplicated. Position 3 E is correct. Position 1 E is wrong position, so E must be present at least twice? 
   - N is in position 2. 
   - M and Y are absent (x in Guess 3). 
4. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, S, T, I, M, Y. 
   This significantly reduces the alphabet. 
   Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, P, U, V, W, Z, etc.

**Breaking down the pattern:** 
- Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 
- We know: position 2 is N, position 3 is E. 
- So pattern: _ N E _ _ 
- From Guess 3: enemy gave E at position 1: marked as '-' meaning E is present but not in position 1. Therefore, since E is confirmed at position 3, the '-' for E in position 1 implies there's at least one other E elsewhere? Or it could be referring to position 3? No—the feedback per position: position 1 E is marked '-', meaning that the letter E is in the word but should not be in position 1. Similarly, position 3 E is marked '✓', so it's correctly placed. 
Therefore, there must be at least one more E in the word besides position 3—because E at position 1 is absent but E is present elsewhere? The '-' indicates E is in the word but not in position 1. Since E is already fixed at position 3, the '-' reinforces that E exists and that position 1 is incorrect, which we already know from position 3. But '-' for a letter implies the letter is present, but in a different position. Therefore, if E is marked '-' at position 1, and we know E is at position 3, this could mean either:
  - There is only one E (at position 3), and the '-' at position 1 just tells us E exists and position 1 is wrong—which is consistent—or...
  - There are multiple E's, and the '-' at position 1 indicates E is present elsewhere beyond position 3. 

But regardless, the '-' doesn't necessarily imply duplication; it only indicates the letter exists but not here. Since position 3 is confirmed E, the '-' at position 1 doesn't require a duplicate—it just confirms E is somewhere else (which is position 3). But it doesn't provide new info beyond confirming E is present and not in position 1. 

Similarly, N at position 2 is correct ✓.

So pattern: position 2 = N, position 3 = E → word is _ N E _ _ 

Additionally, from Guess 3: 
- Position 1 E: '-' → E is present, but not here (could be position 3).
- Position 4 M: x → M absent
- Position 5 Y: x → Y absent

**Deductions:**
- Secret word format: exactly: [letter1] N E [letter4] [letter5]
- Letter1 cannot be E (since E was guessed in position 1 and marked '-'). But E might be duplicated? The '-' doesn't prevent E in other positions except 1? 

But E is confirmed only at position 3 so far. 

Could letter1 be E? No—if E were in position 1, it should be marked accordingly; here, it was marked '-', meaning E is in the word but not position 1. Since E at position 3 is ✓, so position 1 cannot be E. 

Similarly, letter4 and letter5 must differ from M and Y.

Now, letters to exclude: C,R,A,S,T,I,M,Y.
Possible letters for positions 1,4,5: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,O,P,U,V,W,Z

Additionally, since E might be repeated? We need to consider—word might have duplicate E? Not necessarily—but from feedback, position 1 E marked '-' only tells us E is not at position 1 and exists. 

Therefore, possibilities:
- If there's another E beyond position 3, it must be in position 4 or 5? Or not? Positions 4 and 5 are available.

Looking for English words with pattern _ N E _ _ avoiding C,R,A,S,T,I,M,Y.

Common examples:
- **UNLED**? Not common.
- **ONELL**? Not words.

Better: 
- **INLAY** — I absent
- **BLEED** — B L E E D → pattern not _ N E _, incorrect—must have N at position2 and E at position3.

So ? N E ? ?

Possible words:
- **ANKER** — A absent
- **ENDED** — E N D E D → positions: position1:E (but E cannot be position1? From feedback, Guess 3 has E at position1 marked '-', meaning E should not be in position1. Therefore ENDED would have E at position1—invalid for guess. Similarly, for the secret word if E is at position1, but why mark it as wrong position? Contradiction? The secret word cannot have E at position1 because Guess tried E at position1 and was told it's not correct. Therefore, in secret word, position1 must NOT be E.

Therefore, secret word pattern: letter1 ≠ E, letter2=N, letter3=E.

Similarly, letters 4 and 5 ≠ M,Y.

Words: 
- **UNDER** — U N D E R → but R is absent? R banned? Guess 1 banned R, so R absent—cannot have R.
- **DINED** — D I N E D → I absent—invalid.
- **FONDU** — F O N D U → not pattern — position3=N, not E? Must be E at position3.

Need E at position3 explicitly.

**HONED** — H O N E D → positions: H,O,N,E,D → position3=N? Not E—wrong.
Position sequence: position1=H,2=O,3=N,4=E—position4=E, not position3.

Must have position3=E—fixed.

So pattern: ? N E ? ?

So letters at1: something, at2=N, at3=E, at4: something, at5:something.

Avoiding banned letters: C,R,A,S,T,I,M,Y banned.

Possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,O,P,U,V,W,Z

Words: 
- **GIVEN** — G I V E N → I banned—invalid
- **BAKED** — B A K E D → A banned—invalid
- **LUNGE** — L U N G E → pattern: positions1=L,2=U,3=N,4=G,5=E—not E at position3? Wrong unless: L U N G E has position3=N—not E.

Position3 must be E—so sequence after position2=N must be E at position3.

So examples:
- **KNELT**: K N E L T → T banned? T absent—invalid
- **SNEAK**: S banned—invalid
- **BLEED**: B L E E D → position2=L? Not N—wrong pattern.

I am missing—_ N E _ _

Like **ONEAR**? Not valid.

Perhaps **DONEE**? Not common.

Using letters: B, O, K, D, etc.

**BONED** — B O N E D → positions: B,O,N,E,D → position4=E? Position3=N—not E.

Position3 must be E—so N must be position2 and E position3.

**TOKEN** — T banned.

**WOMEN** — W O M E N → position4=E? Positions: W,O,M,E,N → position3=M—not E.

Except **QUEEN**: Q U E E N → positions: Q,U,E,E,N → position3=E? Position1=Q,2=U,3=E,4=E,5=N → indeed position3=E! Also position4=E? And letters: Q,U,E,E,N.

Now banned letters: C,R,A,S,T,I,M,Y—Q,U,N are OK? Yes.

Q is valid—uncommon but possible.

Avoided? Yes.

Similarly, **EJECT** — has banned T and C—invalid.

So QUEEN is possible.

Other options: **BEVEL** — position not.

**INLET** — T and I banned.

Another: **OUNCE** — O U N C E → position3=N—not E.

**FREED** — F R E E D → R banned—invalid.

**GREET** — R and T banned.

Back to QUEEN: pattern ? N E ? → Q U E E N matches positions: position1=Q? No, position1=Q, but our pattern is position2=N? QUEEN has position1=Q,2=U,3=E—position2=U, not N.

Misalignment: QUEEN has positions: Q,U,E,E,N—so position2 is U, position3 is E—it does not have position2=N. But our secret has position2=N fixed.

Therefore QUEEN does not match because position2 is U, whereas we need position2=N.

Confusion. Pattern is fixed: position2=N, position3=E.

So QUEEN has position3=E but position2=U ≠ N.

So invalid for this constraint.

Must have position2=N.

Therefore, words with pattern: [Position1] N E [Position4] [Position5]

Position1 ≠ E (from feedback)

Letters 4 and 5 not M,Y.

Possible words:
- **UNDID** — U N D I D → I banned—invalid
- **BONEY** — B O N E Y → position3=N? Positions: B,O,N,E,Y → position4=E—not position3=E? Wrong. Must be E at position3—here position3=N, position4=E.

Unless we consider no such word? 

Perhaps **ELUTE** — E L U T E → T banned and positions incorrect.

Another idea: **LENTO** — L E N T O → T banned and position3=N—not E.

List: ""annex"" — A and X—invalid.

""bonze"" — B O N Z E → positions：B,O,N,Z,E → position3=N—not E.

Position3=E required.

Perhaps ""incest"" — I,C banned—no.

""mince"" — M,I,C—banned? M banned? From Guess 3, M is absent? Yes, M is x.

So not.

Perhaps **PINED** — P I N E D → I banned—invalid.

**VINED** — V I N E D → I banned.

**WINED** — W I N E D → I banned.

**HONED** — has O banned? H O N E D — position3=N—not E.

Wait, isn't O not banned? Only C,R,A,S,T,I,M,Y banned—O is allowed.

But HONED: H O N E D → positions:1=H,2=O,3=N,4=E—position3=N not E.

Except if I misremember— the word must have position2=N, position3=E.

So for **HONEY**, that's position2=O, position3=N—not matching.

What word has position2=N and position3=E? 

For example: **INEPT** — I N E P T → position2=N, position3=E—yes! Letters: I,N,E,P,T—banned letters: I banned and T banned—invalid.

**UNWED** — U N W E D → position2=N, position3=W? Positions: U,N,W,E,D → position3=W, position4=E—not position3=E unless: position3 is W, not E.

Need position3=E.

**OPENED** more than 5.

Perhaps non-common words? Wordle uses common words usually.

Another: **ANGLE**— A banned.

**BINGE**— B I N G E → I banned and position not—position1=B,2=I,3=N—not E.

I need to consider fewer absent letters.

Perhaps E duplicated—but positionally fixed.

Example: **PENNE**: P E N N E → positions: P,E,N,N,E → position2=E, position3=N— not E at position3. Unless it's E at position1 and 5, position3=N? Not.

Position2=N required.

So words like: ""knell"" — K N E L L→ positions: K,N,E,L,L—yes! Position2=N, position3=E. Letters: K,N,E,L,L.

Banned? K,L not banned. Absent letters are C,R,A,S,T,I,M,Y—K and L are allowed.

Yes, KNELL is a valid word: the sound of a bell rung slowly.

Similarly, pattern fits: position1=K,2=N,3=E,4=L,5=L.

Also, avoids banned letters.

Another option: ""dwell"" — D W E L L→ position2=W? Not N—invalid pattern.

Or ""snell"" — S banned.

So KNELL: K N E L L

First letter K—not tested yet.

Position4=L, position5=L—double letters possible.

Provides good test.

But not sure about prevalence in Wordle.

Alternative: ""fennel"" — F E N N E L→ not 5 letters.

Another word: ""JENNY"" — J E N N Y → position2=E? Positions: J,E,N,N,Y — position2=E—not position2=N and position3=E? Position3=N—incorrect.

Unless ""jenny"" is J,E,N,N,Y—position1=J,2=E,3=N—not E at position3.

Doesn't match.

So KNELL seems valid.

Other possibilities: ""inner"" — I banned.

""biner"" — not common.

""caner"" — C and A banned.

Probably KNELL is acceptable.

To test more letters.

Another word: **DWELT** — D W E L T → T banned—invalid.

**OPENS** — S banned.

**QUEUE** — Q U E U E → positions: Q,U,E,U,E → position1=Q,2=U,3=E—yes! Position2=U? Not position2=N. Need position2=N.

In QUEUE, position2=U.

Pattern mismatch.

So KNELL or similar.

**LINEN** — L I N E N → I banned—invalid.

Focused: **KNEED** — K N E E D → positions: K,N,E,E,D—position3=E—yes. Pattern ?N E? — position1=K,2=N,3=E,4=E,5=D—letter4=E and letter5=D.

This works: K N E E D.

Letters: K,N,E,E,D—avoid banned? C,R,A,S,T,I,M,Y—none, so valid. ""KNEED"" means to bring knee to something.

Provides K and D new.

Similarly, ""BLEED"" has L—position not N.

So KNEED.

Compared to KNELL.

Both possible.

KNEED has E duplicated in position4? Not necessarily issue.

Guess KNEED: tests K and D.

If positions correct or partial.

Similarly, we have E at position3 and N position2.

In Guess 3, enemy had E at position1 marked wrong position—which might fit if E is at position4? But not necessarily.

So: propose KNEED.

Or for safety, choose KNOWN? K N O W N → position3=O—not E—invalid.

Must have E at position3.

So final choice: KNELL or KNEED.

Select KNEED—more common? 

Or KNELL.

Both valid.

Assume **KNELL**.

Thus guessed word: KNELL.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)
     - `C`, `R`, `A` are absent.
     - `N` and `E` are present but not in positions 4 or 5 (respectively).
   - **Guess 2 (""stein"")**: S(x), T(x), E(✓), I(x), N(-)
     - `S`, `T`, `I` are absent.
     - `E` is confirmed at position 3.
     - `N` is present but not in position 5.
   - **Guess 3 (""enemy"")**: E(-), N(✓), E(✓), M(x), Y(x)
     - `E` is present but not in position 1 (strengthens that `E` must be at position 3, and hints at possible duplication).
     - `N` is confirmed at position 2.
     - `M` and `Y` are absent.

2. **Consolidate Known Information**:
   - **Confirmed letters and positions**:
     - Position 2: `N` (fixed).
     - Position 3: `E` (fixed).
     - Secret word pattern: `[letter1] N E [letter4] [letter5]`.
   - **Absent letters**: `C`, `R`, `A`, `S`, `T`, `I`, `M`, `Y` (cannot appear).
   - **Present letters**: `N` (position 2), `E` (position 3), and at least one more instance of `E` may exist due to the `-` for position 1 in Guess 3.
   - **Unused letters**: Focus on high-frequency consonants/vowels not tested: `B`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `K`, `L`, `O`, `P`, `U`, `V`, `W`, `Z`.

3. **Deductions and Constraints**:
   - Position 1 cannot be `E` (per Guess 3 feedback: `E(-)` at position 1).
   - Positions 4–5 cannot repeat absent letters (`M`, `Y`, etc.).
   - Possible duplicates: `E` could appear elsewhere (e.g., position 4 or 5), as hinted by the `E(-)` in Guess 3.
   - Goal: Guess a word that fits the `? N E ? ?` pattern, includes untested letters, and probes positions 1, 4, and 5.

4. **Candidate Words**:
   - Prioritize words with common letters like `L`, `K`, `D`, or `O` to maximize information.
   - Examples:
     - `KNELL`: K N E L L (tests `K`, `L`; double `L`).
     - `KNEED`: K N E E D (tests `K`, `D`; double `E`).
     - `BONED`: B O N E D (invalid—position 3 is `N`, not `E`).
     - `UNDER`: U N D E R (invalid—`R` absent).
   - Strongest candidate: `KNELL` (valid English word, tests `K` and common `L`, avoids absent letters, and fits all constraints).

5. **Why `KNELL`?**:
   - Tests position 1 (`K`), positions 4 and 5 (`L`, `L`—double `L` possible).
   - Provides crucial feedback on `K` (if absent/present) and `L` positioning.
   - Aligns with pattern and expands coverage efficiently.

Avoid repeating letters to maximize coverage.  \n\nThe word **CRANE** is a strong opener because it:  \n- Contains 3 common consonants (C, R, N) and 2 vowels (A, E),  \n- Tests letters frequently appearing in 5-letter words,  \n- Provides early positioning clues for versatile letters like R.\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Alright, let me process the feedback from the first guess. I guessed ""CRANE"" and got quite a lot of information from it:\n\n- C, R, A are all marked as ""x"", meaning none of these letters appear in the secret word at all. That immediately eliminates a big chunk of possibilities.\n- N and E are marked as ""-"", so both N and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions I guessed them in.\n\nBreaking this down:\n\n1. **Letters to exclude:** C, R, A are completely out. That\'s significant because R and A are very common letters. The secret word must avoid these entirely.\n2. **Letters to include:** Both N and E must be in the word somewhere, but:\n   - N is not in the 4th position (since I guessed it there and it\'s wrong position).\n   - E is not in the 5th position (since I guessed it there and it\'s wrong position).\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Contains N and E\n- Excludes C, R, A\n- Is 5 letters long\n\nNow, I need a new guess that incorporates these constraints:\n- Must include N and E (but not in positions 4 or 5 respectively)\n- Must exclude C, R, A\n- Should test new letters to gather more information\n\nSince N and E are confirmed in the word, I\'ll prioritize keeping them in my next guess but in different positions to test their real locations. I\'ll also introduce new common letters since C/R/A are out—good candidates would be T, O, S, L, M, etc.\n\nPossible approach:\n1. **Reposition N:** Since N wasn\'t in position 4, I could try it in position 2, 3, or 5.\n2. **Reposition E:** Since E wasn\'t in position 5, I could move it to position 1, 2, or 3.\n3. **New letters:** Test other common letters like T, O, S, L, etc.\n\nI should avoid positions where we already ruled them out, though:\n\n- Since N was eliminated from position 4, I can place it in 1,2,3, or 5, but caution: position 5 was originally E\'s spot which might conflict if I put N there. Similarly, E can\'t be in position 5 so I have to avoid that placement.\n\nGiven E is highly likely to be somewhere in positions 1-4, and N cannot be in position 4.\n\nGood second guesses should maximize information:\n- Keep N and E to verify their positions\n- Use fresh high-frequency letters: S, T, L, O, M, D, etc.\n\nConsidering possible words that fit:\n- Must include N and E\n- Exclude C, R, A\n\nFor example:\n- Words like **STONE**, **STEIN**, **LEMON**, **MEANT**, **SPINE**\n  \nNow evaluating each:\n- **STONE**: S T O N E → Tests S,T,O (new), keeps N/E but moves them (N to position 4 was bad, but I\'m trying position 4 again? Wait, the feedback said N was present but not in position 4—so placing it in position 4 again is useless. I should move N to a new spot to test its real location.)\n  \nBetter alternatives where N and E shift positions:\n- **MEANT**: M E A N T → But A is excluded! Invalid, since A is ruled out.\n- **SPINE**: S P I N E → This is better. Places E in position 5? But E cannot be in position 5 per feedback. So invalid placement.\n  \nAh, constraint: E cannot be in position 5. So any candidate must place E in positions 1-4 and N not in position 4.\n\nGood options:\n- **N** can be in positions 1,2,3,5\n- **E** can be in 1,2,3,4\n  \nLook for words featuring N and E while avoiding positions that are forbidden AND excluding C,R,A.\n\nStrong candidate: **STEIN** (S,T,E,I,N)\n- It places E in position 3 (avoiding position 5)\n- Places N in position 5 (since position 4 was bad, trying a new spot)\n- Tests S,T,I (new letters)\n- Avoids C,R,A\n\nAnother option: **TOKEN** (T,O,K,E,N) but O and K might be less common.\n\n**STEIN** seems solid:\n- Gives chance to confirm positions of E (pos3) and N (pos5). If either lights up as ""✓"", we\'ve nailed them. If ""-"", we know they\'re elsewhere but still in the word.\n\nAlternatively, **LINES** (L,I,N,E,S) — but N in position 3 (which might be fine), E in 4. Avoids position 4 for N? Yes. Also avoids E in position 5.\n\nBut **LINES** ends with S. That might be okay since S is common. However, starting with L tests a less frequent letter? Not crucial—S,T are higher frequency anyway.\n\nComparing:\n**STEIN**: Tests S,T,E,I,N with E in position 3 and N in position 5—new positions for both ruled-out placements.\n\n**LINES**: N in position 3 (new), E in position 4 (also new position for E). This is fairly equivalent too.\n\nI\'ll select **STEIN** since T and S feel slightly more common than L and I. Plus “stein” is a familiar word.\n\nTherefore, next guess: STEIN\n\nLet me validate:\n- Includes N and E\n- Avoids C,R,A\n- Repositions both (E not in 5th, N not in 4th)\n- Tests S,T,I—high-value consonants.\n\nSeems strategically sound.Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (""CRANE"" → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)):  \n- **C, R, A** are **completely absent** from the secret word.  \n- **N and E** are **present**, but **not in position 4** (for N) or **position 5** (for E).  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n- Must include **N and E** (with N not in position 4; E not in position 5).  \n- Must exclude C, R, A.  \n- To maximize information, focus on **high-frequency letters** (e.g., S, T, L, O) and reposition N/E to untested spots.  \n\nI chose **STEIN**:  \n- Tests S/T/I (new common letters) while retaining N/E in new positions (E in position 3; N in position 5).  \n- Avoids C/R/A entirely.  \n- Efficiently probes E/N positions and expands letter coverage.\n\n<guess>stein</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(✓) I(x) N(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'After reviewing the feedback from the first two guesses:\n\nFrom Guess 1 (""crane""): \n- C, R, A are absent (x)\n- N is present but not in position 4 (-)\n- E is present but not in position 5 (-)\n\nFrom Guess 2 (""stein""):\n- S and T are absent (x)\n- E is correct and in position 3 (✓)  [since it was the third letter]\n- I is absent (x)\n- N is present but not in position 5 (-)  [since it was guessed in position 5]\n\nCurrent deductions:\n- **Secret word contains**: E (fixed in position 3) and N (somewhere, but not position 4 or 5). From ""crane"", E was present but not in position 5. Now E is fixed at position 3.\n\n- **Letters confirmed absent**: C, R, A, S, T, I.\n\n- **Position constraints**:\n  - Position 3 is E (fixed from ""stein"" feedback).\n  - N is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (since it was misplaced there in past guesses).\n    - So N must be in position 1 or 2.\n\nNow expanding:\n- Secret word pattern: _ _ E _ _ \n- Position 1 or 2 must be N.\n\nWe also need additional letters that haven\'t been tested yet. Letters tested so far: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, I. Absentees: C, R, A, S, T, I.\n\nRemaining letters to test: Common consonants/vowels like B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, possibly others.\n\nWe know:\n- Word: ? ? E ? ? \n- N is in position 1 or 2.\n\nGiven the absence of many common letters, the secret word likely uses less frequent letters. We should prioritize:\n- Confirming N\'s position: try it in position 1 or 2.\n- Testing new high-frequency letters: L, O, D, M, etc.\n\nPossible words that fit:\n- Structure: N E ? ? ? or ? N E ? ? \n\nBut E is fixed as the third character, so it\'s actually [letter1] [letter2] E [letter4] [letter5]\n\nAnd N must be letter1 or letter2.\n\nCase 1: N is in position 1 → N _ E _ _\nCase 2: N is in position 2 → _ N E _ _\n\nWe need a valid English word satisfying:\n- Does not contain C, R, A, S, T, I\n- Contains N (in 1 or 2)\n- Contains E (in position 3)\n- The other letters are unknown.\n\nPossible examples:\nFor ""N _ E _ _"": Possible words: NEWER? But W is untested. NEWER contains E at position 3? N E W E R → position3 is W, not E? Wait no—""NEWER"" is N E W E R → position 3 is W. So incorrect.\n\nNeed position 3 to be E.\n\nAnother: NEEDY → N E E D Y → position3 is E? Position3 is E (second E). Okay ""NEEDY"" has N position1, E position2, E position3? But our guess requires position3 to be E—""NEEDY"" has E at position2 and 3. But we know from feedback that E is only confirmed at position3, not whether there\'s another E.\n\nActually, ""steine"" had E at position3, and it was marked correct. So position3 must be E, but other E\'s could exist? Not forbidden yet.\n\nSimilarly, ""crane"" had E at position5 marked absent? No feedback: E was misplaced (wrong position) in ""crane""—it was guessed in position5. That doesn\'t preclude E elsewhere. But in ""stein"", E position3 was ✓, so position3 is definitely E.\n\nNow, looking for words with E in position3 and starting with N or second letter N.\n\nPossible words:\n- If position1 is N: N ? E ? ? → e.g., NODES? But S is absent, invalid. Similarly NAKED? A absent.\n\nAvoiding absentees: C,R,A,S,T,I are out.\n\nOptions:\n- For N in position1: Words like NEEDY → N E E D Y → positions: 1:N, 2:E, 3:E (but E at position3 is fixed—yes), 4:D, 5:Y\n  - Does ""NEEDY"" work? Position3 is E—good.\n  - Letters: N,E,E,D,Y → we know E is allowed, N is in, D and Y untested, and note the double-E. Can we have multiple E\'s? The feedback from ""stein"" about E didn\'t specify if it\'s the only E—it just marked position3 as correct and didn\'t comment on other positions.\n  - However, ""NEEDY"" contains E at position2 as well—but position2 is not yet confirmed. So possible—no contradiction.\n  - Also, absent letters: avoiding C,R,A,S,T,I—yes.\n- Alternatively, NEIGH → N E I G H → I is absent! Forbidden.\n- NOMEN: Too obscure, and O,E,M,N → O and M untested.\n\nFor position2 is N: _ N E _ _\n\nWords like SNORE? S absent—invalid.\nMONEY → M O N E Y → Position2:N (yes), position3:E? Position3 is N—wait: ""MONEY"" letters: M O N E Y → positions:1:M, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:Y → but we have position3 must be E, not N. Incorrect.\n\nCorrect pattern: position3 is E.\n\nSo ""MONEY"" is M O N E Y → position3=N, not E. Wrong.\n\nAnother try: word like ""HONEY"" — H O N E Y → position1:H, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E → position3 is N—not E.\n\nI need something like _ N E _ _ → so character2=N, character3=E.\n\nExamples: INEPT? I absent—invalid.\nONCER? O absent? No, O present? Let\'s list words: AGNES? A absent. So avoiding absentees.\n\nPossible words:\n- **UNMET**: U N M E T → positions:1:U, position2:N, position3:M? Position3 is M—not E. Wrong.\nStructure must be letter1, then N at position2, then E at position3.\n\nSo: ? N E ? ?\n\nValid words: \n- **ANKER**: A absent—invalid.\n- But avoiding C,R,A,S,T,I—so consider letters like O, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\n**BUNCH**: B U N C H → position2=N? Positions:1:B, 2:U, 3:N—not E. Wrong.\n\nNeed position3=E specifically.\n\nSo "" ? N E ? ?"" meaning:\nPosition1: some letter (call it X)\nPosition2: N\nPosition3: E\nPosition4: Y\nPosition5: Z\n\nSo word = [X] N E [Y] [Z]\n\nValid example: **ANGUS** — But G and U present? A is absent? ANGUS has A—invalid.\n\nAnother: **INKER** — I absent.\n\n**OUNCE** — O U N C E → position1:O, 2:U, 3:N—not E.\n\nI\'m struggling. Look for English words ending with ""ENE"" or something? But position3=E, so not ending.\n\nCommon words: like ""BYNTE"" not a word.\n\nPerhaps **LINED** — L I N E D → position3=N? Position sequence: L,I,N,E,D → position3=N, position4=E. But we need position3=E. So no.\n\nAnother thought: what about ""QUEEN"" — Q U E E N → position3=E—yes! Letters: Q,U,E,E,N. Position3=E—good. But Q? And E at position4 also.\n\n""QUEEN"" — positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E (good), 4:E, 5:N. Now, letters: Q,U,E,E,N.\n\nAbsentees: no C,R,A,S,T,I—Q and U are untested. Valid? Q is less common but legitimate.\n\nAlternatives: **GIVEN** — G I V E N → position3=V? Positions: G,I,V,E,N → position3=V, not E.\n\nNeed position3=E.\n\n**HAVEN** — H A V E N → position4=E? Positions: H,A,V,E,N → position4=E. Not.\n\nMust have pattern: either N in position1 with E at 3: like NEEDY, NEEFL? Not, NEEDY as above (NEEDY: N,E,E,D,Y → position3=E).\n\nOther words with N position1 and E position3: \n- **NEWEL**: N E W E L → position3=W? Positions: N,E,W,E,L → position2=E, position3=W—not E. Wrong unless second letter is E? No.\n\nNE?E? words: like NEARS? S absent and A absent.\n\nFocusing: for ""N _ E _ _"": \nNEEDS: S absent.\nNEIGH: I absent.\nNERDS: R absent.\nNEXUS: X not tested, but S absent? S banned.\n\nWith avoiding S and others: NEPER? E P E R → R absent.\n\nNot many common ones. \n\nPerhaps N position2: word pattern ? N E ? ?\n\nLike ""PUNCH"": P U N C H → position3=N? Not E.\n\nPosition3=E: so sequence after N must be E in the third position.\n\nPossible words: \n- KNEEP: K N E E P → positions: K,N,E,E,P → position3=E—yes. Letters: K,N,E,E,P. Avoids absentees? C,R,A,S,T,I absent? Yes, K,N,E,E,P — N and E confirmed, K and P new.\n\nValid word? ""KNEEP"" might not be common—check dictionary? Assuming Wordle accepts variant, but let\'s see alternatives.\n\n**LYNED**: Not common.\n\n**OWNED**: O W N E D → positions: O,W,N,E,D → position3=N? Position sequence: position1:O,2:W,3:N,position4=E—not E at 3.\n\n**UNTIE**: U N T I E → position5=E? Position sequence: U,N,T,I,E → positions:1:U,2:N,3:T,4:I,5:E—position3=T, not E. And T and I absent—invalid.\n\nAnother idea: **UNWED**: U N W E D → position4=E? Positions: U,N,W,E,D → position3=W, position4=E—not E at 3.\n\nCorrecting: to satisfy position3=E, possible word? \n\nExamples like ""ANODE"" — A absent.\n\n""INNER""—I absent.\n\n""ENEMY""—E position1, N position2, E position3—yes: E N E M Y → avoiding absentees? Letters: E,N,E,M,Y—no C,R,A,S,T,I? OK. But is E position1 allowed? We don\'t know yet. Constraints only on N and E positions, not prohibiting E elsewhere.\n\nSo ""ENEMY"": positions:1:E, 2:N, 3:E, 4:M, 5:Y—position3=E—good. Also N at position2—so N is not in positions 4 or 5, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, ""MINED""—I absent—invalid.\n\nSo ""ENEMY"" seems valid: \n- E at position1 — untested? Could be present or not.\n- N at position2 — we know N must be somewhere, here position2—possible.\n- E at position3 — fixed ✓.\n- M and Y new.\n\nIf ""ENEMY"" is the word, but we need to confirm.\n\nAnother word: **ONCER**—O N C E R: C and R absent—invalid.\n\nBack to Case 1: N position1: e.g., NEEDY.\n\nFrom feedback, ""stein"" had E at position3 correct and N present but not position5.\n\nIn NEEDY: N position1, E position2 and 3, etc.\n\nCould be.\n\nBut ENEMY has N position2.\n\nTo maximize information:\n- Guess NEEDY to test N in position1 and double-E possibility.\n- Or ENEMY to test N in position2 and new letters.\n\nBut we have only 6 tries, so need efficient.\n\nSince E is fixed at position3, and N must be in 1 or 2, I can choose a word that:\n- Places N in position 1 (to test Case 1)\n- Or position2 (Case 2)\n\nIf I place N in position1, and if it\'s position1 is ✓ in reality, I get info.\n\nSimilarly for position2.\n\nEither way, I\'ll cover.\n\nChoose common letters: L, O, K, etc.\n\nOption: **NEVER**—E and R? R absent—invalid.\n\n**LEVEL**—L,E,V,E,L → position1:L,2:E,3:V—position3=V? Not E—unless.\n\nMust be E at position3.\n\nAnother: **BELIE**—B E L I E → position3=L? Not E.\n\nDifficult to find words.\n\n**OUNCE**—not.\n\nOr **BEVEL**—B E V E L, position3=V? Not E.\n\nPerhaps uncommon words? Wordle usually uses common words.\n\nList: \nFor pattern ""? N E ? ?"": \n- **ANGEL**: A absent—no\n- **ENGED**? Not a word.\n- **INKED**—I absent.\n- **OKNED**? No.\n\nBetter to think of common words.\n\n**LONGE**: L O N G E → positions: L,O,N,G,E → position3=N, not E—unless: word ""Longe"" not common.\n\nAlternate: **HONEY** — position3=N, not E.\n\nPerhaps ""CHIEF"" not, position varies.\n\nAnother try: position3=E, position2=N → words ending with N E? But not.\n\nSo possible words: ""DIENED"" not 5 letters.\n\nAccept that double-E might be possible? Or other.\n\n""NEEDS"": S absent—invalid.\n\n""NEIGH"": I absent.\n\nSo rare with avoided letters.\n\nPerhaps N position1: pattern N ? E ? ? \n\nExamples: NEEDS — invalid.\nNERVED: R absent.\nNUKED: U,K,E,D — N at1, E at3: N U K E D → positions: N,U,K,E,D — position3=K, position4=E? Not E at3—position3 must be K? Wrong.\n\nExcept if second letter allows E? Like NE E something.\n\nSpecifically N E E ? ? → NEED? But D — possible, NEED is 5-letter? Need is 4? NEEDY as I thought.\n\nNEEDY is valid: N E E D Y -> positions:1:N,2:E,3:E,4:D,5:Y\n\nYes, NEEDY is a valid word: lacking in money; poor.\n\nSimilarly, NEWER: N E W E R -> positions:1:N,2:E,3:W,4:E—position3=W not E. Invalid for position3.\n\nSo NEEDY works for pattern: position1:N, position2:E, position3:E, etc. Position3 is E—good. Also contains E at position2.\n\nNow, we haven\'t ruled out multiple E\'s, so it\'s possible.\n\nNext option: ENEMY (E N E M Y).\n\nBoth are plausible.\n\nTo choose between NEEDY and ENEMY.\n\nNEEDY tests N in position1.\nENEMY tests N in position2.\n\nAlso, NEEDY has D and Y, ENEMY has M and Y.\n\nSince both contain E at position2—in NEEDY position2=E and ENEMY position1=E—but position1=E is not confirmed.\n\nFor information:\nIf I guess ENEMY, and if N is indeed in position2, then I might get ✓ for N position2. If not, it might be marked - or X—but we know N is present.\n\nSimilarly for NEEDY: position1=N, which is a possible location.\n\nGiven that S is absent, T absent, etc. Prioritize testing N position.\n\nI could guess a word with N in position1 and new letters.\n\nOr since ENEMY also tests position1=E, which wasn\'t tested before.\n\nENEMY has advantages: tests E at position1 (possible), N at position2 (possible).\n\nWhereas NEEDY has E at position2 again—but if secret has only one E, it might be weird, but possible.\n\nBoth work.\n\nChoose ENEMY? Or for new letters like O.\n\nOther possibilities: **BEIGY** — not, position vary.\n\n**GUESSED** not.\n\nDecide on ENEMY.\n\nBut let\'s see feedback implied: in ""crane"", E was marked - meaning present but not position5. Now with E at position3 fixed.\n\nGuess: ENEMY\n\nIf secret is ENEMY, feedback: E at position1? Unknown, N position2? Could be -, E position3 ✓, M position4? Unknown, Y position5 unknown.\n\nSimilarly, if NEEDY, N position1 possible.\n\nBut ENEMY also tests M and Y—useful.\n\nAnother option: **OPENS** — contains S absent—no.\n\n**YANKS** — A absent.\n\nI am considering **KENDO** — K E N D O → position3=N, not E—invalid.\n\nSo back. \n\nAnother word: **BEGIN** — G I N — positions: B,E,G,I,N → position2=E, position3=G—not E.\n\nMust have E at position3.\n\nPerhaps ""THREE"" — T H R E E → R absent and position4=E.\n\nNot.\n\nI think ENEMY is acceptable.\n\nOr NEEDY.\n\nBut to test more common letters: NEEDY uses D and Y, ENEMY uses M and Y.\n\nM is less common than L, O? Probably fine.\n\nGoing with ENEMY, as it positions N at2—untested spot.\n\nSimilarly, we haven\'t tested position1 at all—in both guesses, position1 was C then S, both absent.\n\nPosition1 could be many things.\n\nSo ENEMY is a valid guess.\n\nTherefore, next guess: ENEMY\n\nCheck constraints:\n- Position3:E ✓\n- N must be present, not in position4 or5—here position2, good.\n- Excluded letters: C,R,A,S,T,I—none in ENEMY.### Deductive Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Review Previous Feedback**:  \n   - Guess 1 (""crane""): C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)  \n     - Letters `C`, `R`, `A` are **absent** from the secret word.  \n     - `N` is present but **not in position 4**.  \n     - `E` is present but **not in position 5**.  \n   - Guess 2 (""stein""): S(x), T(x), E(✓), I(x), N(-)  \n     - Letters `S`, `T`, `I` are **absent**.  \n     - `E` is confirmed in **position 3** (correct placement).  \n     - `N` is present but **not in position 5**.  \n\n2. **Confirm Known Letters**:  \n   - `E` is fixed at **position 3** of the secret word.  \n   - `N` is present but excluded from positions 4 and 5 (from Guess 1 and Guess 2 feedback). Thus, `N` must be in **position 1 or 2**.  \n   - Absent letters: `C`, `R`, `A`, `S`, `T`, `I` cannot appear.  \n\n3. **Deduce Word Pattern**:  \n   - Secret pattern: `[position1] [position2] E [position4] [position5]`.  \n   - Position 1 or 2 must be `N`.  \n   - Untested positions: 1, 2, 4, and 5 need new letters.  \n\n4. **Prioritize Next Guess Goals**:  \n   - Test `N`\'s position (1 or 2) and cover new high-frequency letters.  \n   - Use only untested letters: Avoid `C,R,A,S,T,I`; prioritize common consonants/vowels like `M`, `Y`, `L`, `O`, `D`, `H`.  \n   - Reposition `N` to an untested spot (either position 1 or 2) while keeping `E` fixed at position 3.  \n\n5. **Candidate Words**:  \n   - **Option 1: `N` in position 1** (e.g., `NEEDY`).  \n     - Pattern: `N E E D Y`. Tests position 1 for `N` and new letters `D`, `Y`. Double `E` possible.  \n     - Concerns: `E` at position 2 may conflict if no duplicate `E`, but feedback hasn\'t ruled this out.  \n   - **Option 2: `N` in position 2** (e.g., `ENEMY`).  \n     - Pattern: `E N E M Y`.

Position 1 E is wrong position, so E must be present at least twice? \n   - N is in position 2. \n   - M and Y are absent (x in Guess 3). \n4. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, S, T, I, M, Y. \n   This significantly reduces the alphabet. \n   Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, P, U, V, W, Z, etc.\n\n**Breaking down the pattern:** \n- Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \n- We know: position 2 is N, position 3 is E. \n- So pattern: _ N E _ _ \n- From Guess 3: enemy gave E at position 1: marked as \'-\' meaning E is present but not in position 1. Therefore, since E is confirmed at position 3, the \'-\' for E in position 1 implies there\'s at least one other E elsewhere? Or it could be referring to position 3? No—the feedback per position: position 1 E is marked \'-\', meaning that the letter E is in the word but should not be in position 1. Similarly, position 3 E is marked \'✓\', so it\'s correctly placed. \nTherefore, there must be at least one more E in the word besides position 3—because E at position 1 is absent but E is present elsewhere? The \'-\' indicates E is in the word but not in position 1. Since E is already fixed at position 3, the \'-\' reinforces that E exists and that position 1 is incorrect, which we already know from position 3. But \'-\' for a letter implies the letter is present, but in a different position. Therefore, if E is marked \'-\' at position 1, and we know E is at position 3, this could mean either:\n  - There is only one E (at position 3), and the \'-\' at position 1 just tells us E exists and position 1 is wrong—which is consistent—or...\n  - There are multiple E\'s, and the \'-\' at position 1 indicates E is present elsewhere beyond position 3. \n\nBut regardless, the \'-\' doesn\'t necessarily imply duplication; it only indicates the letter exists but not here. Since position 3 is confirmed E, the \'-\' at position 1 doesn\'t require a duplicate—it just confirms E is somewhere else (which is position 3). But it doesn\'t provide new info beyond confirming E is present and not in position 1. \n\nSimilarly, N at position 2 is correct ✓.\n\nSo pattern: position 2 = N, position 3 = E → word is _ N E _ _ \n\nAdditionally, from Guess 3: \n- Position 1 E: \'-\' → E is present, but not here (could be position 3).\n- Position 4 M: x → M absent\n- Position 5 Y: x → Y absent\n\n**Deductions:**\n- Secret word format: exactly: [letter1] N E [letter4] [letter5]\n- Letter1 cannot be E (since E was guessed in position 1 and marked \'-\'). But E might be duplicated? The \'-\' doesn\'t prevent E in other positions except 1? \n\nBut E is confirmed only at position 3 so far. \n\nCould letter1 be E? No—if E were in position 1, it should be marked accordingly; here, it was marked \'-\', meaning E is in the word but not position 1. Since E at position 3 is ✓, so position 1 cannot be E. \n\nSimilarly, letter4 and letter5 must differ from M and Y.\n\nNow, letters to exclude: C,R,A,S,T,I,M,Y.\nPossible letters for positions 1,4,5: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,O,P,U,V,W,Z\n\nAdditionally, since E might be repeated? We need to consider—word might have duplicate E? Not necessarily—but from feedback, position 1 E marked \'-\' only tells us E is not at position 1 and exists. \n\nTherefore, possibilities:\n- If there\'s another E beyond position 3, it must be in position 4 or 5? Or not? Positions 4 and 5 are available.\n\nLooking for English words with pattern _ N E _ _ avoiding C,R,A,S,T,I,M,Y.\n\nCommon examples:\n- **UNLED**? Not common.\n- **ONELL**? Not words.\n\nBetter: \n- **INLAY** — I absent\n- **BLEED** — B L E E D → pattern not _ N E _, incorrect—must have N at position2 and E at position3.\n\nSo ? N E ? ?\n\nPossible words:\n- **ANKER** — A absent\n- **ENDED** — E N D E D → positions: position1:E (but E cannot be position1? From feedback, Guess 3 has E at position1 marked \'-\', meaning E should not be in position1. Therefore ENDED would have E at position1—invalid for guess. Similarly, for the secret word if E is at position1, but why mark it as wrong position? Contradiction? The secret word cannot have E at position1 because Guess tried E at position1 and was told it\'s not correct. Therefore, in secret word, position1 must NOT be E.\n\nTherefore, secret word pattern: letter1 ≠ E, letter2=N, letter3=E.\n\nSimilarly, letters 4 and 5 ≠ M,Y.\n\nWords: \n- **UNDER** — U N D E R → but R is absent?

Letters: I,N,E,P,T—banned letters: I banned and T banned—invalid.\n\n**UNWED** — U N W E D → position2=N, position3=W? Positions: U,N,W,E,D → position3=W, position4=E—not position3=E unless: position3 is W, not E.\n\nNeed position3=E.\n\n**OPENED** more than 5.\n\nPerhaps non-common words? Wordle uses common words usually.\n\nAnother: **ANGLE**— A banned.\n\n**BINGE**— B I N G E → I banned and position not—position1=B,2=I,3=N—not E.\n\nI need to consider fewer absent letters.\n\nPerhaps E duplicated—but positionally fixed.\n\nExample: **PENNE**: P E N N E → positions: P,E,N,N,E → position2=E, position3=N— not E at position3.

Pattern ?N E? — position1=K,2=N,3=E,4=E,5=D—letter4=E and letter5=D.\n\nThis works: K N E E D.\n\nLetters: K,N,E,E,D—avoid banned? C,R,A,S,T,I,M,Y—none, so valid. ""KNEED"" means to bring knee to something.\n\nProvides K and D new.\n\nSimilarly, ""BLEED"" has L—position not N.\n\nSo KNEED.\n\nCompared to KNELL.\n\nBoth possible.\n\nKNEED has E duplicated in position4? Not necessarily issue.\n\nGuess KNEED: tests K and D.\n\nIf positions correct or partial.\n\nSimilarly, we have E at position3 and N position2.\n\nIn Guess 3, enemy had E at position1 marked wrong position—which might fit if E is at position4? But not necessarily.\n\nSo: propose KNEED.\n\nOr for safety, choose KNOWN?

We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
  - C, R, A are absent.
  - N is present but not in position 4.
  - E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""stein"" -> S(x) T(x) E(✓) I(x) N(-)
  - S, T, I are absent.
  - E is correct and in position 3.
  - N is present but not in position 5.

Guess 3: ""enemy"" -> E(-) N(✓) E(✓) M(x) Y(x)
  - E in position 1 is present but wrong position (but note: we already know E is in position 3, so this suggests there might be another E? However, the feedback for position 1 E is '-' meaning it is in the word but not here. Since we have E in position 3, this could be the same E or a duplicate. But note: the feedback for the same letter can be tricky. However, the rules typically allow for duplicate letters. But in this case, the feedback for the first E (position 1) is '-' and the third E (position 3) is '✓'. This implies that the E at position 1 is not correct, but there is an E in the word (which we know is at position 3). It does not necessarily imply two E's. However, the feedback for the second E (which is at position 3) is correct, so that one is fixed. The '-' for position 1 E only tells us that the letter E is not in position 1, which we already know because it's at position 3. So it doesn't force a duplicate. But note: the word might have two E's? We cannot rule it out.

  However, from Guess 3 we also get:
  - N is correct in position 2 (so we have position 2 is N and position 3 is E).
  - M and Y are absent.

Guess 4: ""knell"" -> K(✓) N(✓) E(✓) L(x) L(x)
  - K is correct and in position 1.
  - N is correct in position 2 (already known).
  - E is correct in position 3 (already known).
  - Both L's (positions 4 and 5) are absent (x). So L is not in the word at all.

Now, we know:
- The secret word starts with K, then N, then E: so the pattern is ""K N E _ _"".
- We have confirmed absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, I, M, Y, L.
- The remaining positions (4 and 5) must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list and are valid.

Also, from Guess 1, we know that N is present (and now we know it's in position 2) and E is present (position 3). The feedback for N and E in Guess 1 was '-' meaning they were present but not in the positions guessed (4 and 5 respectively). That is consistent.

Now, what letters are left? We have used: C, R, A, S, T, I, M, Y, L (absent) and K, N, E (present). The alphabet has 26 letters, so remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z. (Note: J and Q are also possible but less common.)

We need two letters for positions 4 and 5. The word must be a valid English word.

Given the pattern ""K N E _ _"", we can think of words that fit.

Common words:
- ""KNEW"" is 4 letters, so not.
- ""KNEAD"": but A is absent (from Guess 1) -> invalid.
- ""KNEEL"": but we have two E's? And L is absent (from Guess 4) -> invalid.
- ""KNIFE"": I is absent (Guess 2) and F is available? Let's check: positions 4 and 5 would be I and F? But I is absent -> invalid.
- ""KNOCK"": C and K? C is absent (Guess 1) and also note we have K at the beginning, so the last letter is K? But then we have two K's? And C is absent -> invalid.

Let's list possible words:

- ""KNEED"": This would be K N E E D. But we have two E's? And D is a possible letter. However, in Guess 3, we had ""enemy"" and the first E was marked as '-' (present but wrong position). If the word were ""KNEED"", then we have E in positions 3 and 4. The E at position 3 is fixed. The E at position 4 would be a new one. But note: in Guess 3, we had E in position 1 (which is not in the word) and E in position 3 (correct). The feedback for position 1 E was '-' meaning that E is in the word but not at position 1. That is satisfied by the E at position 3 and 4. Also, in Guess 4, we have ""knell"" and we know L is absent, so ""KNEED"" avoids L. But we must check if D is available: D has not been tested, so it's possible. However, we have to see if ""KNEED"" is a valid word. It is (meaning to hit or touch with the knee).

But wait: in Guess 4, we have feedback that the last two letters (which were L and L) are absent. So for ""KNEED"", the last two letters would be E and D. We don't have feedback on E and D yet.

Another possibility: ""KNEWT"" - not a common word.

""KNEAD"" is invalid because of A.

""KNOWE"" - an old word for a hill, but O and W are available? Let's see: ""KNOWE"" is K N O W E -> but that would be positions: K, N, O, W, E -> but we require position 3 to be E, so this has E at the end. Invalid pattern.

We must have position 3 as E, so the word must be ""K N E ? ?"".

Other options:
- ""KNEES"": but S is absent (Guess 2) -> invalid.
- ""KNEEL"": L is absent -> invalid.
- ""KNEAD"": A absent -> invalid.

So ""KNEED"" is a candidate: K N E E D.

But note: we have two E's. Is that allowed? The feedback so far doesn't contradict. In fact, the '-' for E in position 1 in Guess 3 might be explained by the E in position 4 (if we have two E's). Also, in Guess 1, E was in position 5 and was marked '-' meaning present but wrong position. That could be the E in position 3 or 4.

Another candidate: ""KNELL"" we already tried and the last two L's are absent.

What about ""KNEED"" vs. ""KNAVE"": but A is absent.

""KNURL"": U and R? R is absent -> invalid.

""KNEED"" seems a strong candidate.

But are there others?

""KNEEP"" - not a common word.

""KNEED"" is 5 letters and valid.

Another possibility: ""KNEAD"" is invalid.

What about ""KNEIF""? Not a word.

Or ""KNETS"": S absent.

So ""KNEED"" is a good candidate.

But let's check the letters: D is not in the absent list, so it's allowed.

Alternatively, we might have ""KNOPS"": O and P? But S absent -> invalid.

""KNOLL"": L is absent -> invalid.

So I think ""KNEED"" is the most likely.

But wait: in the pattern, we have two E's? We have E at position 3 and we are considering E at position 4. We must check if the feedback allows two E's.

In Guess 3: ""enemy"" had two E's: one at position 1 (which was marked '-') and one at position 3 (marked '✓'). The feedback for the E at position 1 being '-' means that there is an E that is not at position 1. It doesn't specify which E. Since we have one E at position 3, that explains the feedback. It doesn't require a second E. However, it doesn't forbid a second E either.

In Guess 4: ""knell"" had no E in the last two positions (they were L's) so no new information about E duplication.

So the word could have one E (only at position 3) or two E's.

But if we have only one E, then what could the last two letters be? We need a word ""K N E ? ?"" without any E in the last two. And without using the absent letters.

For example:
- ""KNEED"" has two E's, so if we want one E, we avoid that.

What words have only one E (at position 3) and then two other letters?

For instance:
- ""KNEEL"" -> invalid because of L.
- ""KNEAD"" -> invalid because of A.
- ""KNEWT"" -> not a word.
- ""KNEPH"" -> not a word.
- ""KNEZO"" -> not a word.

Perhaps ""KNEED"" is the only common word that fits? 

Another possibility: ""KNEES"" -> invalid because of S.

""KNEED"" is the only one I can think of.

But note: we have the letter D available. And we haven't used D.

What about ""KNEED"" vs. ""KNEAD"" (which is invalid) or ""KNEEL"" (invalid).

So I think we should guess ""KNEED"".

But let's see if there is a word with different letters.

For example, ""KNEVE"" -> not a word.

""KNEBO"" -> no.

So I think ""KNEED"" is the word.

But wait: in the feedback for Guess 4, we have K(✓) N(✓) E(✓) L(x) L(x). So we know the first three are K, N, E and the last two are not L. So we are only missing the last two.

We have to find two letters for positions 4 and 5 that are not in the absent list and form a valid word.

The absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, I, M, Y, L.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

Now, what letters can come after ""KNE"" to form a word?

- ""KNEED"": uses E and D. But E is already used? We can have duplicate E? Yes, Wordle allows duplicates.

Other words:
- ""KNEES"": uses E and S -> S is absent -> invalid.
- ""KNEEP"": uses E and P -> but ""kneep"" is not a common word? Not in standard dictionaries.
- ""KNEEF"": not a word.
- ""KNEEU"": no.

Without E in the last two, we have:
- ""KNOBS"": O, B, S -> S absent -> invalid.
- ""KNOPS"": O, P, S -> S absent -> invalid.
- ""KNOWE"": O, W, E -> but then the word would be K N O W E, which has position 3 as O, not E -> invalid pattern.

We must have the pattern ""K N E ? ?"", so the next two letters must form a word with ""KNE"" as the first three.

Common endings:
- ""KNEED"" (as above)
- ""KNEEL"" (invalid due to L)
- ""KNEES"" (invalid due to S)

Less common:
- ""KNEEP"" (not recognized)
- ""KNEEF"" (not recognized)

Another: ""KNEVE"" (not a word)

So ""KNEED"" is the only common word that fits the pattern and avoids the absent letters.

Therefore, we guess ""KNEED"".

But note: we have already used E? We are allowed duplicates. The feedback doesn't show that E is duplicated, but it doesn't forbid.

In fact, the word ""kneed"" has two E's: one at position 3 and one at position 4.

In Guess 3, we had two E's: one at position 1 (which was wrong) and one at position 3 (correct). The feedback for the first E was '-' meaning that there is an E that is not at position 1. That could be the E at position 3 or the E at position 4? Actually, the feedback for the E at position 1 being '-' only requires that there is at least one E in the word that is not at position 1. It doesn't specify which one. So having two E's is acceptable.

Similarly, in Guess 1, E was at position 5 and was marked '-' meaning there is an E not at position 5. Again, satisfied by the E at position 3 and 4.

So I think ""KNEED"" is the word.

Therefore, we guess ""KNEED"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

1. **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  
   - C(x), R(x), A(x) → Letters `C`, `R`, `A` are **absent**.  
   - N(-), E(-) → `N` and `E` are present but **not in positions 4 or 5**.  

2. **Guess 2 (""stein"")**:  
   - S(x), T(x), I(x) → Letters `S`, `T`, `I` are **absent**.  
   - E(✓) → `E` is **correct in position 3**.  
   - N(-) → `N` is present but **not in position 5**.  

3. **Guess 3 (""enemy"")**:  
   - E(-) → `E` is present but **not in position 1** (consistent with position 3 being fixed).  
   - N(✓) → `N` is **correct in position 2**.  
   - E(✓) → `E` is **correct in position 3** (reconfirmation).  
   - M(x), Y(x) → `M` and `Y` are **absent**.  

4. **Guess 4 (""knell"")**:  
   - K(✓) → `K` is **correct in position 1**.  
   - N(✓) → `N` is **correct in position 2** (reconfirmation).  
   - E(✓) → `E` is **correct in position 3** (reconfirmation).  
   - L(x), L(x) → `L` is **absent** (both instances).  

### Key Deductions:
- **Secret word pattern**: `K N E _ _` (positions 1, 2, and 3 are fixed as `K`, `N`, `E`).  
- **Absent letters**: `C`, `R`, `A`, `S`, `T`, `I`, `M`, `Y`, `L` (cannot appear).  
- **Present letters**: `K`, `N`, `E` (with `E` confirmed at position 3, and `N` at position 2).  
- **Constraints**:  
  - Position 4 and 5 must be filled with letters not in the absent list.  
  - `E` may appear again (duplicates possible, as hinted by `E(-)` in Guess 3).  
- **Remaining possible letters**: `B`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `O`, `P`, `U`, `V`, `W`, `Z` (and less common letters like `J`, `Q`, `X`).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Solve the word by testing valid combinations for positions 4 and 5.  
- **Approach**:  
  - The only common English word fitting `K N E _ _` and avoiding absent letters is **""KNEED""** (meaning ""to strike or touch with the knee"").  
  - Why ""KNEED""?  
    - Uses `E` in position 4 (allowed, as duplicates are possible and `E` is not ruled out).  
    - Uses `D` in position 5 (`D` is untested and valid).  
    - Avoids all absent letters.  
- **If not ""KNEED""**: No other common words fit (e.g., ""KNEEL"" invalid due to `L`, ""KNEAD"" invalid due to `A`, ""KNIFE"" invalid due to `I`).  

<guess>kneed</guess>",kneed,"We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
  - C, R, A are absent.
  - N is present but not in position 4.
  - E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""stein"" -> S(x) T(x) E(✓) I(x) N(-)
  - S, T, I are absent.
  - E is correct and in position 3.
  - N is present but not in position 5.

Guess 3: ""enemy"" -> E(-) N(✓) E(✓) M(x) Y(x)
  - E in position 1 is present but wrong position (but note: we already know E is in position 3, so this suggests there might be another E? However, the feedback for position 1 E is '-' meaning it is in the word but not here. Since we have E in position 3, this could be the same E or a duplicate. But note: the feedback for the same letter can be tricky. However, the rules typically allow for duplicate letters. But in this case, the feedback for the first E (position 1) is '-' and the third E (position 3) is '✓'. This implies that the E at position 1 is not correct, but there is an E in the word (which we know is at position 3). It does not necessarily imply two E's. However, the feedback for the second E (which is at position 3) is correct, so that one is fixed. The '-' for position 1 E only tells us that the letter E is not in position 1, which we already know because it's at position 3. So it doesn't force a duplicate. But note: the word might have two E's? We cannot rule it out.

  However, from Guess 3 we also get:
  - N is correct in position 2 (so we have position 2 is N and position 3 is E).
  - M and Y are absent.

Guess 4: ""knell"" -> K(✓) N(✓) E(✓) L(x) L(x)
  - K is correct and in position 1.
  - N is correct in position 2 (already known).
  - E is correct in position 3 (already known).
  - Both L's (positions 4 and 5) are absent (x). So L is not in the word at all.

Now, we know:
- The secret word starts with K, then N, then E: so the pattern is ""K N E _ _"".
- We have confirmed absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, I, M, Y, L.
- The remaining positions (4 and 5) must be filled with letters that are not in the absent list and are valid.

Also, from Guess 1, we know that N is present (and now we know it's in position 2) and E is present (position 3). The feedback for N and E in Guess 1 was '-' meaning they were present but not in the positions guessed (4 and 5 respectively). That is consistent.

Now, what letters are left? We have used: C, R, A, S, T, I, M, Y, L (absent) and K, N, E (present). The alphabet has 26 letters, so remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z. (Note: J and Q are also possible but less common.)

We need two letters for positions 4 and 5. The word must be a valid English word.

Given the pattern ""K N E _ _"", we can think of words that fit.

Common words:
- ""KNEW"" is 4 letters, so not.
- ""KNEAD"": but A is absent (from Guess 1) -> invalid.
- ""KNEEL"": but we have two E's? And L is absent (from Guess 4) -> invalid.
- ""KNIFE"": I is absent (Guess 2) and F is available? Let's check: positions 4 and 5 would be I and F? But I is absent -> invalid.
- ""KNOCK"": C and K? C is absent (Guess 1) and also note we have K at the beginning, so the last letter is K? But then we have two K's? And C is absent -> invalid.

Let's list possible words:

- ""KNEED"": This would be K N E E D. But we have two E's? And D is a possible letter. However, in Guess 3, we had ""enemy"" and the first E was marked as '-' (present but wrong position). If the word were ""KNEED"", then we have E in positions 3 and 4. The E at position 3 is fixed. The E at position 4 would be a new one. But note: in Guess 3, we had E in position 1 (which is not in the word) and E in position 3 (correct). The feedback for position 1 E was '-' meaning that E is in the word but not at position 1. That is satisfied by the E at position 3 and 4. Also, in Guess 4, we have ""knell"" and we know L is absent, so ""KNEED"" avoids L. But we must check if D is available: D has not been tested, so it's possible. However, we have to see if ""KNEED"" is a valid word. It is (meaning to hit or touch with the knee).

But wait: in Guess 4, we have feedback that the last two letters (which were L and L) are absent. So for ""KNEED"", the last two letters would be E and D. We don't have feedback on E and D yet.

Another possibility: ""KNEWT"" - not a common word.

""KNEAD"" is invalid because of A.

""KNOWE"" - an old word for a hill, but O and W are available? Let's see: ""KNOWE"" is K N O W E -> but that would be positions: K, N, O, W, E -> but we require position 3 to be E, so this has E at the end. Invalid pattern.

We must have position 3 as E, so the word must be ""K N E ? ?"".

Other options:
- ""KNEES"": but S is absent (Guess 2) -> invalid.
- ""KNEEL"": L is absent -> invalid.
- ""KNEAD"": A absent -> invalid.

So ""KNEED"" is a candidate: K N E E D.

But note: we have two E's. Is that allowed? The feedback so far doesn't contradict. In fact, the '-' for E in position 1 in Guess 3 might be explained by the E in position 4 (if we have two E's). Also, in Guess 1, E was in position 5 and was marked '-' meaning present but wrong position. That could be the E in position 3 or 4.

Another candidate: ""KNELL"" we already tried and the last two L's are absent.

What about ""KNEED"" vs. ""KNAVE"": but A is absent.

""KNURL"": U and R? R is absent -> invalid.

""KNEED"" seems a strong candidate.

But are there others?

""KNEEP"" - not a common word.

""KNEED"" is 5 letters and valid.

Another possibility: ""KNEAD"" is invalid.

What about ""KNEIF""? Not a word.

Or ""KNETS"": S absent.

So ""KNEED"" is a good candidate.

But let's check the letters: D is not in the absent list, so it's allowed.

Alternatively, we might have ""KNOPS"": O and P? But S absent -> invalid.

""KNOLL"": L is absent -> invalid.

So I think ""KNEED"" is the most likely.

But wait: in the pattern, we have two E's? We have E at position 3 and we are considering E at position 4. We must check if the feedback allows two E's.

In Guess 3: ""enemy"" had two E's: one at position 1 (which was marked '-') and one at position 3 (marked '✓'). The feedback for the E at position 1 being '-' means that there is an E that is not at position 1. It doesn't specify which E. Since we have one E at position 3, that explains the feedback. It doesn't require a second E. However, it doesn't forbid a second E either.

In Guess 4: ""knell"" had no E in the last two positions (they were L's) so no new information about E duplication.

So the word could have one E (only at position 3) or two E's.

But if we have only one E, then what could the last two letters be? We need a word ""K N E ? ?"" without any E in the last two. And without using the absent letters.

For example:
- ""KNEED"" has two E's, so if we want one E, we avoid that.

What words have only one E (at position 3) and then two other letters?

For instance:
- ""KNEEL"" -> invalid because of L.
- ""KNEAD"" -> invalid because of A.
- ""KNEWT"" -> not a word.
- ""KNEPH"" -> not a word.
- ""KNEZO"" -> not a word.

Perhaps ""KNEED"" is the only common word that fits? 

Another possibility: ""KNEES"" -> invalid because of S.

""KNEED"" is the only one I can think of.

But note: we have the letter D available. And we haven't used D.

What about ""KNEED"" vs. ""KNEAD"" (which is invalid) or ""KNEEL"" (invalid).

So I think we should guess ""KNEED"".

But let's see if there is a word with different letters.

For example, ""KNEVE"" -> not a word.

""KNEBO"" -> no.

So I think ""KNEED"" is the word.

But wait: in the feedback for Guess 4, we have K(✓) N(✓) E(✓) L(x) L(x). So we know the first three are K, N, E and the last two are not L. So we are only missing the last two.

We have to find two letters for positions 4 and 5 that are not in the absent list and form a valid word.

The absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, I, M, Y, L.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

Now, what letters can come after ""KNE"" to form a word?

- ""KNEED"": uses E and D. But E is already used? We can have duplicate E? Yes, Wordle allows duplicates.

Other words:
- ""KNEES"": uses E and S -> S is absent -> invalid.
- ""KNEEP"": uses E and P -> but ""kneep"" is not a common word? Not in standard dictionaries.
- ""KNEEF"": not a word.
- ""KNEEU"": no.

Without E in the last two, we have:
- ""KNOBS"": O, B, S -> S absent -> invalid.
- ""KNOPS"": O, P, S -> S absent -> invalid.
- ""KNOWE"": O, W, E -> but then the word would be K N O W E, which has position 3 as O, not E -> invalid pattern.

We must have the pattern ""K N E ? ?"", so the next two letters must form a word with ""KNE"" as the first three.

Common endings:
- ""KNEED"" (as above)
- ""KNEEL"" (invalid due to L)
- ""KNEES"" (invalid due to S)

Less common:
- ""KNEEP"" (not recognized)
- ""KNEEF"" (not recognized)

Another: ""KNEVE"" (not a word)

So ""KNEED"" is the only common word that fits the pattern and avoids the absent letters.

Therefore, we guess ""KNEED"".

But note: we have already used E? We are allowed duplicates. The feedback doesn't show that E is duplicated, but it doesn't forbid.
