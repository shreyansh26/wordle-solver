We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).
   - It doesn't repeat any letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
N(-) -> N is in the word but in the wrong position.
E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter N, but not at the 4th position (since it was guessed as the 4th letter and got '-' meaning wrong position).
- The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word.

Also, note that our guess was ""crane"", which is valid.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We must choose a 5-letter English word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A, E (since they are not in the word).
- Does contain N (because N is present), but not in the 4th position.

Moreover, we can use common English words and try to cover other common letters.

Since N is in the word but not at position 4, N must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We also know that the word does not have C, R, A, E. So we avoid those letters.

Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Common vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

We should try to cover more common letters to get more feedback.

A good strategy is to use a word that includes N (since we know it's there) in a different position and uses other common letters.

Possible positions for N: We cannot put N at position 4, so we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We also want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

Let me think of words that:
1. Do not have C, R, A, E.
2. Have N, but not in the 4th position.
3. Contain other common letters.

Common letters in English: T, H, S, L, N, etc. But N is already known, so we can try T, H, S, L, O, etc.

For example:
- If we put N at the beginning: words like ""NIGHT"", ""NOISY"", etc. But we must avoid E and A, which we are avoiding.

Another idea: We can try ""HOIST"", but that doesn't have N? So we must include N.

A word with N: Let's list some words that have N and do not have C, R, A, E.

For instance:
- Position 1: N (so words starting with N). Examples: ""NIGHT"", ""NOISY"", ""NEXUS"" (but E is not allowed), not ""NEXUS"" because E is forbidden.

We cannot have E, so ""NIGHT"" has I,G,H,T -> no forbidden letters.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" said N is in the word but not at position 4. So if we put N at position 1 in our next word, that's allowed because it's a different position.

Similarly, we can try ""STUNG"", but has S,T,U,N,G -> doesn't have forbidden letters? But U is okay. Also, N is at position 4? But wait: the secret word's N is not at position 4, so if we put N at position 4 in our guess, it would be wrong position? Actually, it might be that the secret word has N at position 1, and if we put it at 4, we might get a '-', but we are going for a new word.

However, we need a word that includes N in a position that is not 4? Actually, no: our word can put N anywhere except position 4? No, we can put N anywhere, because the secret word's N is not necessarily in a fixed position. But note: the secret word has one N (we don't know if it has more, but let's assume no duplicates unless feedback shows otherwise). But the feedback only told us about one N.

Moreover, we should not use the position 4 for N because it was already guessed at position 4 and it was wrong, so we know N is not at position 4. But when we guess, we can still use N at position 4? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it won't be at position 4. But if we put N at position 4, we might get a '-' if the secret word has N elsewhere? So it's not a wasteful guess because it tests a different position? Actually, we already know N is not at position 4, so if we put N at a position where it might be, we get either '✓' or '-'. Whereas putting it at a position we haven't tried could give us new information.

So, let's avoid position 4 for N? Actually, we don't know that N must be avoided at position 4 in our guess? The rule is that the feedback is for the secret word: the secret word's N is not at position 4, so if we put N at position 4 in our guess, we will always get an 'x'? Because it's not at position 4 in the secret word and we have no clue about other positions? No:

Recall the feedback: In the guess ""crane"", the 4th letter N was marked as '-' meaning it is in the word but not at that position. Therefore, if we guess the same word again, we'd get the same feedback? But we are guessing a different word.

In our next guess, if we put N at position 4 again, we know it will not be correct (because it was already wrong), but it might still be '-' if the secret word has N somewhere else? Actually, that's what '-' means: the letter is in the word but wrong position. So if we put N at position 4 again, it will still show as '-', because we haven't found the spot? But we don't gain new information if we already know it's not position 4.

Instead, we should put N in a different position to test where it is.

Therefore, for the next guess, we should avoid putting N at position 4, and try one of the other positions: 1,2,3,5.

Given that, let me choose a word with N in a new position.

We also want to test other common consonants and vowels.

Possible words:

- If we put N at position 1: ""NIGHT"", ""NOISY"", ""NOTCH"" (but O,T,C,H -> but C is forbidden? C is forbidden? We had C(x) so not in word). So ""NOTCH"" has C? so invalid because C is not allowed.

Words starting with N without C,R,A,E: 
""NIHIL"" - not a word? Usually ""NIHIL"" is not common, but we need common words.
""NOBLY"" - N,O,B,L,Y -> doesn't have C,R,A,E -> valid.
""NOISY"" - N,O,I,S,Y -> valid.
""NIGHT"" - N,I,G,H,T -> valid and has common letters.

- Position 2: ... We can choose a word that has N in the second position? e.g., ""ONION"" but has O and I? but also O at position 1 and N at position 2 and 4? And we know N is at least once? But secret word might have multiple N? But we don't know. But ""ONION"" has N at 2 and 4. But position 4: we know N not at position 4? Actually, we know the secret word has N and it is not at position 4. But if we put an N at position 4 in the guess, it will be marked as 'x'? Because it's not at position 4? Or if the secret word has two N? Actually, we don't know. But it's safer to assume one N since we saw one feedback.

Moreover, we should avoid duplicate letters until we know more.

But if we use ""ONION"", we are placing N at position 2 and 4. Position 4 we know is wrong, so that N at 4 will likely be x (if there's no duplicate) or - if there is another N? But that's messy.

Since we are only required to give one word, let me pick a word without duplicates and with N not at position 4.

Options:
""NOBLY"": N,O,B,L,Y
""NOISY"": N,O,I,S,Y
""NIGHT"": N,I,G,H,T

Also, position 5: words ending in N: e.g., ""THORN"", but R is forbidden? R(x) from first feedback -> forbidden, so not.

""BROWN"" has R and W -> R not allowed? because R(x) in first guess -> not in secret word.

We must avoid R too.

We also avoid C, R, A, E.

So letters to avoid: C, R, A, E.

Therefore, for position 5: words ending with N without C,R,A,E: 
""DOWN"" -> 4 letters? 
""STAIN"" has A -> not allowed? A(x) so A not in word.
""MOURN"" has U,R -> R forbidden? and R? R is forbidden? So not.

Actually, words ending with N: ""BLOWN"" has B,L,O,W,N -> has W? But it does not have forbidden letters? But wait ""BLOWN"": W is okay? Not C,R,A,E? So valid.

But W is not very common? Maybe we can do better.

Another option: ""HOUND"" has H,O,U,N,D -> valid? and N at position 5? But U and H,D,O.

Which is best?

I think ""NIGHT"" is a good candidate:
- Starts with N (so tests position 1 for N? If it shows ✓, we know position 1 is N; if -, we know N is not at position 1 but at some other position and we have tested position 1; if x? but we know N is in the word so at worst we get '-'.)
- Also includes I (vowel), G, H, T (common consonants).

Alternatively, ""POINT"" has P,O,I,N,T -> but N at position 4? Position 4 is the forbidden position for N? We must avoid position 4? Actually, we are allowed to put N at position 4 again? But it will be marked as '-' again? Let me think:

In the secret word, N is in the word but not at position 4. So if we guess a word with N at position 4, we will get '-' (because N is in the word, just not at that position). So we wouldn't learn anything new about the location? Therefore, to avoid wasting a position, we should put N at a position we haven't tried.

Therefore, let's avoid position 4 for N.

For ""POINT"", the N is at position 4 -> so we avoid? Then we can't use it.

Similarly, ""BLOWN"" has N at position 5 -> that's new, so okay.

Another word: ""JOINT"" has N at position 4? Same problem.

So let's consider words that have N but not at position 4:

Possible positions: 1,2,3,5.

I have ""NIGHT"" (N at 1), ""BLOWN"" (N at 5), and also:

Position 2: e.g., ""SNOUT"" - S,N,O,U,T -> N at position 2? But S,N,O,U,T: avoid C,R,A,E -> yes? S,N,O,U,T: S at 1? This word tests S at position 1? Also has O, U, T.

But ""SNOUT"" includes S.

Another: ""UNTIL"" - U,N,T,I,L -> N at position 2? And has common letters.

But U is not very common? We should try to get more common letters.

I think ""NIGHT"" is a good choice: common and no forbidden letters.

But note: we must not use forbidden letters (C,R,A,E). ""NIGHT"" doesn't have them.

So I will go with ""NIGHT"".

Therefore, second guess: ""NIGHT""

<guess>night</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- N is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked with ""-""), meaning it must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 5 in the secret word.

For the second guess:
- Avoid using C, R, A, E.
- Include N, but **not in position 4** (since that position is already ruled out).
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., T, H, S, L, O, I, G, etc.) to maximize information.
- Choose a word with high letter diversity and no duplicates where possible.

The word **""night""** fits:
- Contains N (placed at position 1 to test a new location).
- Includes other common letters: I (vowel), G, H, T.
- No forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).
- All letters are distinct, allowing clear feedback.

This guess will help locate N and test four new letters simultaneously.

<guess>night</guess>",night,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
N(-) -> N is in the word but in the wrong position.
E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter N, but not at the 4th position (since it was guessed as the 4th letter and got '-' meaning wrong position).
- The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word.

Also, note that our guess was ""crane"", which is valid.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We must choose a 5-letter English word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A, E (since they are not in the word).
- Does contain N (because N is present), but not in the 4th position.

Moreover, we can use common English words and try to cover other common letters.

Since N is in the word but not at position 4, N must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We also know that the word does not have C, R, A, E. So we avoid those letters.

Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Common vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

We should try to cover more common letters to get more feedback.

A good strategy is to use a word that includes N (since we know it's there) in a different position and uses other common letters.

Possible positions for N: We cannot put N at position 4, so we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let me think of words that:
1. Do not have C, R, A, E.

Common letters in English: T, H, S, L, N, etc. But N is already known, so we can try T, H, S, L, O, etc.

We cannot have E, so ""NIGHT"" has I,G,H,T -> no forbidden letters.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" said N is in the word but not at position 4. So if we put N at position 1 in our next word, that's allowed because it's a different position.

Similarly, we can try ""STUNG"", but has S,T,U,N,G -> doesn't have forbidden letters? But U is okay. Also, N is at position 4? But wait: the secret word's N is not at position 4, so if we put N at position 4 in our guess, it would be wrong position? Actually, it might be that the secret word has N at position 1, and if we put it at 4, we might get a '-', but we are going for a new word.

But we don't gain new information if we already know it's not position 4.

Instead, we should put N in a different position to test where it is.

Therefore, for the next guess, we should avoid putting N at position 4, and try one of the other positions: 1,2,3,5.

Given that, let me choose a word with N in a new position.

We also want to test other common consonants and vowels.

Possible words:

- If we put N at position 1: ""NIGHT"", ""NOISY"", ""NOTCH"" (but O,T,C,H -> but C is forbidden? C is forbidden? We had C(x) so not in word). So ""NOTCH"" has C? so invalid because C is not allowed.

Words starting with N without C,R,A,E: 
""NIHIL"" - not a word? Usually ""NIHIL"" is not common, but we need common words.
""NOBLY"" - N,O,B,L,Y -> doesn't have C,R,A,E -> valid.
""NOISY"" - N,O,I,S,Y -> valid.
""NIGHT"" - N,I,G,H,T -> valid and has common letters.

- Position 2: ... We can choose a word that has N in the second position? e.g., ""ONION"" but has O and I? but also O at position 1 and N at position 2 and 4? And we know N is at least once? But secret word might have multiple N? But we don't know. But ""ONION"" has N at 2 and 4. But position 4: we know N not at position 4? Actually, we know the secret word has N and it is not at position 4. But if we put an N at position 4 in the guess, it will be marked as 'x'? Because it's not at position 4? Or if the secret word has two N? Actually, we don't know. But it's safer to assume one N since we saw one feedback.

But if we use ""ONION"", we are placing N at position 2 and 4. Position 4 we know is wrong, so that N at 4 will likely be x (if there's no duplicate) or - if there is another N? But that's messy.

Since we are only required to give one word, let me pick a word without duplicates and with N not at position 4.

Options:
""NOBLY"": N,O,B,L,Y
""NOISY"": N,O,I,S,Y
""NIGHT"": N,I,G,H,T

Also, position 5: words ending in N: e.g., ""THORN"", but R is forbidden? R(x) from first feedback -> forbidden, so not.

""BROWN"" has R and W -> R not allowed? because R(x) in first guess -> not in secret word.

We must avoid R too.

We also avoid C, R, A, E.

So letters to avoid: C, R, A, E.

Therefore, for position 5: words ending with N without C,R,A,E: 
""DOWN"" -> 4 letters? 
""STAIN"" has A -> not allowed? A(x) so A not in word.
""MOURN"" has U,R -> R forbidden? and R? R is forbidden? So not.

Actually, words ending with N: ""BLOWN"" has B,L,O,W,N -> has W? But it does not have forbidden letters? But wait ""BLOWN"": W is okay? Not C,R,A,E? So valid.

But W is not very common? Maybe we can do better.

Another option: ""HOUND"" has H,O,U,N,D -> valid? and N at position 5? But U and H,D,O.

Which is best?

I think ""NIGHT"" is a good candidate:
- Starts with N (so tests position 1 for N? If it shows ✓, we know position 1 is N; if -, we know N is not at position 1 but at some other position and we have tested position 1; if x? but we know N is in the word so at worst we get '-'.)
- Also includes I (vowel), G, H, T (common consonants).

Alternatively, ""POINT"" has P,O,I,N,T -> but N at position 4? Position 4 is the forbidden position for N? We must avoid position 4? Actually, we are allowed to put N at position 4 again? But it will be marked as '-' again? Let me think:

In the secret word, N is in the word but not at position 4. So if we guess a word with N at position 4, we will get '-' (because N is in the word, just not at that position). So we wouldn't learn anything new about the location? Therefore, to avoid wasting a position, we should put N at a position we haven't tried.

Therefore, let's avoid position 4 for N.

For ""POINT"", the N is at position 4 -> so we avoid? Then we can't use it.

Similarly, ""BLOWN"" has N at position 5 -> that's new, so okay.

Another word: ""JOINT"" has N at position 4? Same problem.

So let's consider words that have N but not at position 4:

Possible positions: 1,2,3,5.

I have ""NIGHT"" (N at 1), ""BLOWN"" (N at 5), and also:

Position 2: e.g., ""SNOUT"" - S,N,O,U,T -> N at position 2? But S,N,O,U,T: avoid C,R,A,E -> yes? S,N,O,U,T: S at 1? This word tests S at position 1? Also has O, U, T.

But ""SNOUT"" includes S.

Another: ""UNTIL"" - U,N,T,I,L -> N at position 2? And has common letters.

But U is not very common? We should try to get more common letters.

I think ""NIGHT"" is a good choice: common and no forbidden letters.

But note: we must not use forbidden letters (C,R,A,E). ""NIGHT"" doesn't have them.

So I will go with ""NIGHT"".

Therefore, second guess: ""NIGHT""

<guess>night</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- N is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked with ""-""), meaning it must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 5 in the secret word.

For the second guess:
- Avoid using C, R, A, E.
- Include N, but **not in position 4** (since that position is already ruled out).
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., T, H, S, L, O, I, G, etc.) to maximize information.
- Choose a word with high letter diversity and no duplicates where possible.

The word **""night""** fits:
- Contains N (placed at position 1 to test a new location).
- Includes other common letters: I (vowel), G, H, T.
- No forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).
- All letters are distinct, allowing clear feedback.

This guess will help locate N and test four new letters simultaneously.",Guess 2: night -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(x) G(x) H(-) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,hunky,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).
   - It doesn't repeat any letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
N(-) -> N is in the word but in the wrong position.
E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter N, but not at the 4th position (since it was guessed as the 4th letter and got '-' meaning wrong position).
- The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word.

Also, note that our guess was ""crane"", which is valid.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We must choose a 5-letter English word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A, E (since they are not in the word).
- Does contain N (because N is present), but not in the 4th position.

Moreover, we can use common English words and try to cover other common letters.

Since N is in the word but not at position 4, N must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We also know that the word does not have C, R, A, E. So we avoid those letters.

Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Common vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

We should try to cover more common letters to get more feedback.

A good strategy is to use a word that includes N (since we know it's there) in a different position and uses other common letters.

Possible positions for N: We cannot put N at position 4, so we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We also want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

Let me think of words that:
1. Do not have C, R, A, E.
2. Have N, but not in the 4th position.
3. Contain other common letters.

Common letters in English: T, H, S, L, N, etc. But N is already known, so we can try T, H, S, L, O, etc.

For example:
- If we put N at the beginning: words like ""NIGHT"", ""NOISY"", etc. But we must avoid E and A, which we are avoiding.

Another idea: We can try ""HOIST"", but that doesn't have N? So we must include N.

A word with N: Let's list some words that have N and do not have C, R, A, E.

For instance:
- Position 1: N (so words starting with N). Examples: ""NIGHT"", ""NOISY"", ""NEXUS"" (but E is not allowed), not ""NEXUS"" because E is forbidden.

We cannot have E, so ""NIGHT"" has I,G,H,T -> no forbidden letters.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" said N is in the word but not at position 4. So if we put N at position 1 in our next word, that's allowed because it's a different position.

Similarly, we can try ""STUNG"", but has S,T,U,N,G -> doesn't have forbidden letters? But U is okay. Also, N is at position 4? But wait: the secret word's N is not at position 4, so if we put N at position 4 in our guess, it would be wrong position? Actually, it might be that the secret word has N at position 1, and if we put it at 4, we might get a '-', but we are going for a new word.

However, we need a word that includes N in a position that is not 4? Actually, no: our word can put N anywhere except position 4? No, we can put N anywhere, because the secret word's N is not necessarily in a fixed position. But note: the secret word has one N (we don't know if it has more, but let's assume no duplicates unless feedback shows otherwise). But the feedback only told us about one N.

Moreover, we should not use the position 4 for N because it was already guessed at position 4 and it was wrong, so we know N is not at position 4. But when we guess, we can still use N at position 4? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it won't be at position 4. But if we put N at position 4, we might get a '-' if the secret word has N elsewhere? So it's not a wasteful guess because it tests a different position? Actually, we already know N is not at position 4, so if we put N at a position where it might be, we get either '✓' or '-'. Whereas putting it at a position we haven't tried could give us new information.

So, let's avoid position 4 for N? Actually, we don't know that N must be avoided at position 4 in our guess? The rule is that the feedback is for the secret word: the secret word's N is not at position 4, so if we put N at position 4 in our guess, we will always get an 'x'? Because it's not at position 4 in the secret word and we have no clue about other positions? No:

Recall the feedback: In the guess ""crane"", the 4th letter N was marked as '-' meaning it is in the word but not at that position. Therefore, if we guess the same word again, we'd get the same feedback? But we are guessing a different word.

In our next guess, if we put N at position 4 again, we know it will not be correct (because it was already wrong), but it might still be '-' if the secret word has N somewhere else? Actually, that's what '-' means: the letter is in the word but wrong position. So if we put N at position 4 again, it will still show as '-', because we haven't found the spot? But we don't gain new information if we already know it's not position 4.

Instead, we should put N in a different position to test where it is.

Therefore, for the next guess, we should avoid putting N at position 4, and try one of the other positions: 1,2,3,5.

Given that, let me choose a word with N in a new position.

We also want to test other common consonants and vowels.

Possible words:

- If we put N at position 1: ""NIGHT"", ""NOISY"", ""NOTCH"" (but O,T,C,H -> but C is forbidden? C is forbidden? We had C(x) so not in word). So ""NOTCH"" has C? so invalid because C is not allowed.

Words starting with N without C,R,A,E: 
""NIHIL"" - not a word? Usually ""NIHIL"" is not common, but we need common words.
""NOBLY"" - N,O,B,L,Y -> doesn't have C,R,A,E -> valid.
""NOISY"" - N,O,I,S,Y -> valid.
""NIGHT"" - N,I,G,H,T -> valid and has common letters.

- Position 2: ... We can choose a word that has N in the second position? e.g., ""ONION"" but has O and I? but also O at position 1 and N at position 2 and 4? And we know N is at least once? But secret word might have multiple N? But we don't know. But ""ONION"" has N at 2 and 4. But position 4: we know N not at position 4? Actually, we know the secret word has N and it is not at position 4. But if we put an N at position 4 in the guess, it will be marked as 'x'? Because it's not at position 4? Or if the secret word has two N? Actually, we don't know. But it's safer to assume one N since we saw one feedback.

Moreover, we should avoid duplicate letters until we know more.

But if we use ""ONION"", we are placing N at position 2 and 4. Position 4 we know is wrong, so that N at 4 will likely be x (if there's no duplicate) or - if there is another N? But that's messy.

Since we are only required to give one word, let me pick a word without duplicates and with N not at position 4.

Options:
""NOBLY"": N,O,B,L,Y
""NOISY"": N,O,I,S,Y
""NIGHT"": N,I,G,H,T

Also, position 5: words ending in N: e.g., ""THORN"", but R is forbidden? R(x) from first feedback -> forbidden, so not.

""BROWN"" has R and W -> R not allowed? because R(x) in first guess -> not in secret word.

We must avoid R too.

We also avoid C, R, A, E.

So letters to avoid: C, R, A, E.

Therefore, for position 5: words ending with N without C,R,A,E: 
""DOWN"" -> 4 letters? 
""STAIN"" has A -> not allowed? A(x) so A not in word.
""MOURN"" has U,R -> R forbidden? and R? R is forbidden? So not.

Actually, words ending with N: ""BLOWN"" has B,L,O,W,N -> has W? But it does not have forbidden letters? But wait ""BLOWN"": W is okay? Not C,R,A,E? So valid.

But W is not very common? Maybe we can do better.

Another option: ""HOUND"" has H,O,U,N,D -> valid? and N at position 5? But U and H,D,O.

Which is best?

I think ""NIGHT"" is a good candidate:
- Starts with N (so tests position 1 for N? If it shows ✓, we know position 1 is N; if -, we know N is not at position 1 but at some other position and we have tested position 1; if x? but we know N is in the word so at worst we get '-'.)
- Also includes I (vowel), G, H, T (common consonants).

Alternatively, ""POINT"" has P,O,I,N,T -> but N at position 4? Position 4 is the forbidden position for N? We must avoid position 4? Actually, we are allowed to put N at position 4 again? But it will be marked as '-' again? Let me think:

In the secret word, N is in the word but not at position 4. So if we guess a word with N at position 4, we will get '-' (because N is in the word, just not at that position). So we wouldn't learn anything new about the location? Therefore, to avoid wasting a position, we should put N at a position we haven't tried.

Therefore, let's avoid position 4 for N.

For ""POINT"", the N is at position 4 -> so we avoid? Then we can't use it.

Similarly, ""BLOWN"" has N at position 5 -> that's new, so okay.

Another word: ""JOINT"" has N at position 4? Same problem.

So let's consider words that have N but not at position 4:

Possible positions: 1,2,3,5.

I have ""NIGHT"" (N at 1), ""BLOWN"" (N at 5), and also:

Position 2: e.g., ""SNOUT"" - S,N,O,U,T -> N at position 2? But S,N,O,U,T: avoid C,R,A,E -> yes? S,N,O,U,T: S at 1? This word tests S at position 1? Also has O, U, T.

But ""SNOUT"" includes S.

Another: ""UNTIL"" - U,N,T,I,L -> N at position 2? And has common letters.

But U is not very common? We should try to get more common letters.

I think ""NIGHT"" is a good choice: common and no forbidden letters.

But note: we must not use forbidden letters (C,R,A,E). ""NIGHT"" doesn't have them.

So I will go with ""NIGHT"".

Therefore, second guess: ""NIGHT""

<guess>night</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- N is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked with ""-""), meaning it must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 5 in the secret word.

For the second guess:
- Avoid using C, R, A, E.
- Include N, but **not in position 4** (since that position is already ruled out).
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., T, H, S, L, O, I, G, etc.) to maximize information.

""NIGHT"" doesn\'t have them.\n\nSo I will go with ""NIGHT"".\n\nTherefore, second guess: ""NIGHT""\n\n<guess>night</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": \n- C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x"").\n- N is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked with ""-""), meaning it must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 5 in the secret word.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Avoid using C, R, A, E.\n- Include N, but **not in position 4** (since that position is already ruled out).\n- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., T, H, S, L, O, I, G, etc.) to maximize information.\n- Choose a word with high letter diversity and no duplicates where possible.\n\nThe word **""night""** fits:\n- Contains N (placed at position 1 to test a new location).\n- Includes other common letters: I (vowel), G, H, T.\n- No forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).\n- All letters are distinct, allowing clear feedback.\n\nThis guess will help locate N and test four new letters simultaneously.\n\n<guess>night</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: night -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(x) G(x) H(-) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, E are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not at position 4.

Guess 2: ""night"" -> N(-), I(x), G(x), H(-), T(x)
Meaning:
- N is in the word but not at position 1 (since we got '-' for N at position 1, meaning it's present but not here).
- I, G, T are not in the word (x).
- H is in the word but not at position 4 (since it was guessed at position 4 and got '-').

So, combining the information:

Letters not in the word: C, R, A, E, I, G, T
Letters in the word: N and H (and we know N is not at position 1 or 4, and H is not at position 4)

Also, from guess 1, N is not at position 4, and now from guess 2, N is not at position 1. So N must be at position 2, 3, or 5.

H is in the word and not at position 4. We don't know about other positions for H.

We have used 9 distinct letters that are not in the word: C, R, A, E, I, G, T. And we have two letters that are in: N and H.

The secret word has 5 letters, so there are 3 more letters to discover (since N and H are two of them).

We need to choose a new word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A, E, I, G, T (since they are not in the word)
- Must contain N and H (because they are in the word, and we want to find their positions)
- We should avoid putting N at position 1 or 4 (since we know it's not there) and H at position 4 (since we know it's not there). So for N, we can try position 2, 3, or 5; for H, we can try positions 1,2,3,5.

Also, we should try to cover new common letters to get more information.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the 9 excluded: 
Excluded: C, R, A, E, I, G, T
So available: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: H and N are already known to be in the word, so we must include them.

We can also try to use common letters from the available set: like S, L, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

We need to form a 5-letter word with H and N, and three other letters from the available set, without using the excluded letters.

Also, we should avoid positions that we know are wrong for N and H.

Specifically:
- N cannot be at position 1 or 4. So we can put N at 2, 3, or 5.
- H cannot be at position 4. So we can put H at 1,2,3,5.

But note: we don't want to put both in positions that might conflict? We just need to test.

We also want to maximize information by testing new positions for N and H and including new letters.

Possible words:

Let me think of words that have both H and N, and three other allowed letters.

For example:
- ""HOUND"": H,O,U,N,D -> but we have O,U,D. Are they allowed? O, U, D are not excluded? Yes. But note: ""HOUND"" has H at 1, O at 2, U at 3, N at 4, D at 5. But we cannot put N at position 4 because we know it's not at position 4? Actually, we can put it, but it will be marked as '-' again? Because we know it's not at 4. So we don't gain new information about N's position? Also, we are using a position we know is wrong. So it's better to avoid position 4 for N.

Therefore, we should choose a word where N is at position 2, 3, or 5.

Similarly, for H, avoid position 4.

So let's try to put N at position 2 or 3 or 5, and H at 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).

Option 1: N at position 2. Then we can have words like: _ N _ _ _
But we need H in the word. So for example, ""ONH??"" not a word.

Option 2: N at position 3: _ _ N _ _
Then we can have H at position 1: H _ N _ _
Or H at position 2: _ H N _ _
Or H at position 5: _ _ N _ H

Option 3: N at position 5: _ _ _ _ N
Then H can be at 1,2,3.

Let me think of actual words.

First, with N at position 3 and H at position 1: ""HUN??"" 
- ""HUNCH"" but C is excluded? Not allowed.
- ""HUNKS"" has K and S -> allowed? H,U,N,K,S -> but we have U,K,S. But ""HUNKS"" is a word? Yes, meaning a hunk of something. But N is at position 3? H(1),U(2),N(3),K(4),S(5). But we are putting N at 3, which is allowed. And H at 1. Also, K and S are new.

But note: we have to avoid position 4 for H? H is at 1, so that's fine. And N at 3 is new.

But we also have to avoid putting H at position 4? We are not.

Another word: ""HUSKY"" but no N? Not.

With N at position 3 and H at position 2: _ H N _ _
Like ""SHOWN"" but W and N? ""SHOWN"": S,H,O,W,N -> N is at position 5? Not 3.

""THINS"" but T is excluded? T is not allowed.

""CHINS"" but C excluded.

""PHONE"" but P,H,O,N,E -> E is excluded? E is not allowed.

""WHINY"" but W,H,I,N,Y -> I is excluded? I is not allowed.

So hard to find with H at 2 and N at 3.

Now, with N at position 3 and H at position 5: _ _ N _ H
Like ""BONKH"" not a word.
""PINCH"" but P,I,N,C,H -> I and C excluded? Not allowed.

Not many words.

Now, try N at position 5: _ _ _ _ N
With H at position 1: H _ _ _ N
Words: ""HUMAN"" but U,M,A -> A excluded? Not allowed.
""HEMAN"" not a word.
""HYMEN"" but Y,M,E -> E excluded? Not allowed.
""HOLLY"" no N? Not.

With H at position 2: _ H _ _ N
Like ""SHOWN"" -> S,H,O,W,N -> allowed? S,H,O,W,N. Letters: S, H, O, W, N. None excluded? Excluded are C,R,A,E,I,G,T. So S,O,W are allowed. And H and N are in the word. So ""SHOWN"" is a valid word? But N is at position 5? And H at position 2? And we avoid position 4 for H? H is at 2, so position 4 is not H? So that's fine.

But we are putting N at position 5? That's a new position we haven't tried.

Also, we are testing S, O, W.

Another word: ""THORN"" but T and R excluded? Not allowed.

""CHAIN"" but C and A excluded? Not.

So ""SHOWN"" seems possible.

But let's check: S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5.

We know N is not at position 4? But we are putting it at 5? So that's fine.

Similarly, H is at 2, which is not position 4? So okay.

Now, with N at position 2: _ N _ _ _
And H at position 1: H N _ _ _ -> ""HNS??"" not common? ""HONEY"" but O,E,Y -> E excluded? Not.
""HANDY"" but A excluded? Not.

H at position 3: _ _ N H _ ? Like ""DINH?"" not a word.

H at position 5: _ N _ _ H -> ""UNH??"" ""UNHOLY"" but O,L,Y -> and U,N,H,O,L,Y? 6 letters? Not.

""INHAB"" not a word.

So ""SHOWN"" seems a good candidate.

Another option: N at position 3 and H at position 1: ""HUNKS"" as I thought earlier? H at 1, U at 2, N at 3, K at 4, S at 5.

But we are putting N at 3? That's allowed. H at 1? Allowed. And K at 4? We don't know about K. S at 5.

But we have to avoid putting H at position 4? We are not.

However, we are putting N at position 3? That's a new position.

But note: we are putting K at position 4? We don't know if that's a problem? It's a new letter.

But we are testing two new positions for N and H? Actually, we are testing position 1 for H and position 3 for N.

Also, we are testing U, K, S.

But ""HUNKS"" is a valid word? Yes.

Another word: ""HANKY"" but A excluded? Not.

""FUNKY"" but F,U,N,K,Y -> N at 3? F at 1, U at 2, N at 3, K at 4, Y at 5. But F is allowed? Yes, F is not excluded.

But ""FUNKY"" is a word? Yes.

But we have H to include? ""FUNKY"" doesn't have H? We must include H because it's in the word.

We must include both H and N.

So ""HUNKS"" has H and N.

Similarly, ""HUMUS"" but M,U,S -> and no N? Not.

So between ""SHOWN"" and ""HUNKS"", which is better?

""SHOWN"": tests S, H, O, W, N. H at position 2, N at position 5.
""HUNKS"": tests H, U, N, K, S. H at position 1, N at position 3.

We need to test H and N in new positions.

For H: we only know it's not at position 4. We haven't tested position 1,2,3,5? In ""night"", we tested H at position 4? So we know H is not at 4. We haven't tested other positions.

Similarly for N: we tested at position 1 and 4? In ""crane"" at 4, in ""night"" at 1? So we know not at 1 and 4. So positions 2,3,5 are possible.

In ""SHOWN"", we are testing H at position 2 and N at position 5? Both new positions.

In ""HUNKS"", we are testing H at position 1 and N at position 3? Also new.

Both are good.

But we also want to cover more common letters.

Common letters from available: S, L, O, U, D, P, B, M, etc.

""SHOWN"" has S, O, W? W is less common? But O is common.

""HUNKS"" has U, K, S? K is less common.

But both are acceptable.

Another word: ""SHUNT"" but T is excluded? Not allowed.

""PHONE"" but E excluded? Not.

""MOUTH"" but M,O,U,T,H -> T excluded? T is not allowed? From guess 2, T(x) so T is not in the word? So we cannot use T.

In ""SHOWN"", no T? Good.

In ""HUNKS"", no T? Good.

But we must not use T.

Another word: ""BOUND"" but B,O,U,N,D -> has N at position 4? Not allowed? We are avoiding N at 4? And also, no H? We must include H.

So not.

""FOUND"" same, no H.

""POUND"" same.

How about ""HOUND""? H,O,U,N,D -> but N at position 4? We are avoiding that? Because we know N is not at 4? So if we put N at 4, we get '-' and we don't learn the position? So it's better to avoid.

Therefore, I think ""SHOWN"" or ""HUNKS"" are good.

But let's see if we can find a word with L or other common letters.

For example, with N at position 2: ""SNOWY"" but S,N,O,W,Y -> no H? Must have H.

""SHINY"" but I excluded? Not.

""SLUNG"" but S,L,U,N,G -> G excluded? G is not allowed? From guess 2, G(x) so not in word? So cannot use G.

Similarly, ""CLUNG"" has C? Not.

So hard.

Another: ""JUMPS"" no H or N.

I think ""SHOWN"" is a good choice.

But ""SHOWN"" has W? And W is not very common? But it's acceptable.

Alternatively, ""HUSKY"" but no N? Not.

""BUNCH"" but C excluded? Not.

So I'll go with ""SHOWN"".

But in ""SHOWN"", we have H at position 2 and N at position 5? And we are testing S, O, W.

But we must ensure that we are not using any excluded letters: S, H, O, W, N. Excluded: C,R,A,E,I,G,T. So all are allowed.

Also, positions: N at 5? That's a new position we haven't tried? We tried N at 4 and 1? Now 5? So if we get a '-' for N, we know it's not at 5? Then it must be at 2 or 3? Similarly for H at 2: if we get a '-' for H, we know it's not at 2? Then H must be at 1,3,5? But we are testing position 2.

Actually, if we get a '✓' for H at 2, then we know position 2 is H. Similarly for N at 5.

If we get a '-' for H at 2, then H is in the word but not at 2? Then we know H is at 1,3, or 5? But we are testing position 2? So we get information.

Similarly for N.

So it's good.

But note: we are not testing position 3 at all? But that's okay.

Another word: ""HOWLS"" but H,O,W,L,S -> no N? Must have N.

Not.

""SOLID"" no H or N.

I think ""SHOWN"" is fine.

But let me think of a word that tests position 3 for N? For example, with N at 3.

Like ""PLUNK"" but P,L,U,N,K -> no H? Not.

""CLANK"" has C? Not.

""BLANK"" has B,L,A,N,K -> A excluded? Not.

""FLUNG"" has F,L,U,N,G -> G excluded? Not.

""JUMPY"" no H or N.

So ""HUNKS"" might be better because it tests N at position 3? Which is one of the possibilities.

In ""HUNKS"": H at 1, U at 2, N at 3, K at 4, S at 5.

We are testing:
- H at position 1: if ✓, then H is at 1; if -, then H is not at 1 but in the word? But we know H is in the word? So if we get x for H? But we know H is in the word? So it cannot be x? It must be either ✓ or -? Because it's in the word.

Similarly for N at 3: we know N is in the word? So it must be ✓ or -.

So we can get:

- If H at 1 is ✓, then we know position 1 is H.
- If H at 1 is -, then H is not at position 1? Then it must be at 2,3, or 5? But we are testing position 1? So we get information.

Similarly for N at 3: if ✓, then position 3 is N; if -, then N is not at 3? Then it must be at 2 or 5? Because we know not at 1 and 4.

Also, we are testing U, K, S.

But K and S are less common? But okay.

Another word: ""HOUND"" but N at 4? We avoid.

""POUND"" same.

""FOUND"" same.

""BOUND"" same.

""WOUND"" same.

""MOUNT"" has T? Not allowed.

""SOUTH"" has T? Not.

""LOUSE"" has E? Not.

I think ""HUNKS"" is acceptable.

But let's see if there is a word with O? O is common.

For example, ""HONED"" but E and D? E excluded? Not.

""SHONE"" has E? Not.

""PHONY"" has P,H,O,N,Y -> no E? But no H? H is at position 1? ""PHONY"": P(1),H(2),O(3),N(4),Y(5). But N at position 4? We are avoiding? Because we know N not at 4? So if we put N at 4, we get '-' and we don't learn? So not good.

Similarly, ""SHONE"" has E? Not.

""THONG"" has T and G? Not allowed.

So I think ""HUNKS"" or ""SHOWN"" are the best.

But in ""SHOWN"", we have O, which is common.

In ""HUNKS"", we have U and K, which are less common.

But both are valid.

Another word: ""BOWLS"" no H or N.

""SOLID"" no.

""DOZEN"" has E and Z? E excluded? Not.

""HOIST"" no N.

I think I'll go with ""SHOWN"" because it has O, which is a common vowel.

So guess: ""SHOWN""

But let's confirm the letters: S, H, O, W, N.

Excluded letters: C,R,A,E,I,G,T are not in, so S,H,O,W,N are all allowed.

And we are testing H at position 2 and N at position 5.

Also, S at 1, O at 3, W at 4.

So we get feedback on all.

If we get a '✓' for N at 5, then we know N is at 5? If not, then it's at 2 or 3.

Similarly for H at 2.

So it's good.

Therefore, I choose ""SHOWN"".

<guess>shown</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)  
  - C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.  
  - N is in the word but **not at position 4**.  

- **Guess 2: night** → N(-), I(x), G(x), H(-), T(x)  
  - N is in the word but **not at position 1** (since it was guessed at position 1 and got ""-"").  
  - I, G, T are **not** in the word.  
  - H is in the word but **not at position 4** (since it was guessed at position 4 and got ""-"").  

### Key Inferences:
- **Excluded letters (not in the word)**: C, R, A, E, I, G, T (9 letters).  
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: N and H.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - N cannot be at position 1 or 4 (from feedback). So N must be at position 2, 3, or 5.  
  - H cannot be at position 4 (from feedback). So H must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
- **Unknowns**: The secret word has 5 letters, so 3 additional letters (besides N and H) need to be discovered. These must come from the remaining available letters: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Must include N and H** to test their positions, avoiding known invalid positions:  
  - N: Not at 1 or 4 → test position 2, 3, or 5.  
  - H: Not at 4 → test position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
- **Avoid excluded letters** (C, R, A, E, I, G, T).  
- **Maximize information** by:  
  - Testing new positions for N and H (e.g., N at 5 or 3, H at 2 or 1).  
  - Including common unused letters (e.g., S, O, L, U, D) to increase coverage.  
- **Word choice**: ""SHOWN"" (S, H, O, W, N) is selected because:  
  - Contains both N and H.  
  - N is at position 5 (a new, untested position).  
  - H is at position 2 (a new, untested position).  
  - Tests new common letters: S (position 1), O (position 3), W (position 4).  
  - No excluded letters and all letters are distinct.  
  - If N at position 5 is correct, it will show ""✓""; if not, it will show ""-"" (narrowing N to position 2 or 3). Similarly, H at position 2 will provide positional feedback.  

<guess>shown</guess>",shown,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, E are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not at position 4.

Guess 2: ""night"" -> N(-), I(x), G(x), H(-), T(x)
Meaning:
- N is in the word but not at position 1 (since we got '-' for N at position 1, meaning it's present but not here).
- I, G, T are not in the word (x).
- H is in the word but not at position 4 (since it was guessed at position 4 and got '-').

So, combining the information:

Letters not in the word: C, R, A, E, I, G, T
Letters in the word: N and H (and we know N is not at position 1 or 4, and H is not at position 4)

Also, from guess 1, N is not at position 4, and now from guess 2, N is not at position 1. So N must be at position 2, 3, or 5.

H is in the word and not at position 4. We don't know about other positions for H.

We have used 9 distinct letters that are not in the word: C, R, A, E, I, G, T. And we have two letters that are in: N and H.

The secret word has 5 letters, so there are 3 more letters to discover (since N and H are two of them).

We need to choose a new word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A, E, I, G, T (since they are not in the word)
- Must contain N and H (because they are in the word, and we want to find their positions)
- We should avoid putting N at position 1 or 4 (since we know it's not there) and H at position 4 (since we know it's not there). So for N, we can try position 2, 3, or 5; for H, we can try positions 1,2,3,5.

Also, we should try to cover new common letters to get more information.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the 9 excluded: 
Excluded: C, R, A, E, I, G, T
So available: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: H and N are already known to be in the word, so we must include them.

We can also try to use common letters from the available set: like S, L, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

We need to form a 5-letter word with H and N, and three other letters from the available set, without using the excluded letters.

Also, we should avoid positions that we know are wrong for N and H.

Specifically:
- N cannot be at position 1 or 4. So we can put N at 2, 3, or 5.
- H cannot be at position 4. So we can put H at 1,2,3,5.

But note: we don't want to put both in positions that might conflict? We just need to test.

We also want to maximize information by testing new positions for N and H and including new letters.

Possible words:

Let me think of words that have both H and N, and three other allowed letters.

For example:
- ""HOUND"": H,O,U,N,D -> but we have O,U,D. Are they allowed? O, U, D are not excluded? Yes. But note: ""HOUND"" has H at 1, O at 2, U at 3, N at 4, D at 5. But we cannot put N at position 4 because we know it's not at position 4? Actually, we can put it, but it will be marked as '-' again? Because we know it's not at 4. So we don't gain new information about N's position? Also, we are using a position we know is wrong. So it's better to avoid position 4 for N.

Therefore, we should choose a word where N is at position 2, 3, or 5.

Similarly, for H, avoid position 4.

So let's try to put N at position 2 or 3 or 5, and H at 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).

Option 1: N at position 2. Then we can have words like: _ N _ _ _
But we need H in the word. So for example, ""ONH??"" not a word.

Option 2: N at position 3: _ _ N _ _
Then we can have H at position 1: H _ N _ _
Or H at position 2: _ H N _ _
Or H at position 5: _ _ N _ H

Option 3: N at position 5: _ _ _ _ N
Then H can be at 1,2,3.

Let me think of actual words.

First, with N at position 3 and H at position 1: ""HUN??"" 
- ""HUNCH"" but C is excluded? Not allowed.
- ""HUNKS"" has K and S -> allowed? H,U,N,K,S -> but we have U,K,S. But ""HUNKS"" is a word? Yes, meaning a hunk of something. But N is at position 3? H(1),U(2),N(3),K(4),S(5). But we are putting N at 3, which is allowed. And H at 1. Also, K and S are new.

But note: we have to avoid position 4 for H? H is at 1, so that's fine. And N at 3 is new.

But we also have to avoid putting H at position 4? We are not.

Another word: ""HUSKY"" but no N? Not.

With N at position 3 and H at position 2: _ H N _ _
Like ""SHOWN"" but W and N? ""SHOWN"": S,H,O,W,N -> N is at position 5? Not 3.

""THINS"" but T is excluded? T is not allowed.

""CHINS"" but C excluded.

""PHONE"" but P,H,O,N,E -> E is excluded? E is not allowed.

""WHINY"" but W,H,I,N,Y -> I is excluded? I is not allowed.

So hard to find with H at 2 and N at 3.

Now, with N at position 3 and H at position 5: _ _ N _ H
Like ""BONKH"" not a word.
""PINCH"" but P,I,N,C,H -> I and C excluded? Not allowed.

Not many words.

Now, try N at position 5: _ _ _ _ N
With H at position 1: H _ _ _ N
Words: ""HUMAN"" but U,M,A -> A excluded? Not allowed.
""HEMAN"" not a word.
""HYMEN"" but Y,M,E -> E excluded? Not allowed.
""HOLLY"" no N? Not.

With H at position 2: _ H _ _ N
Like ""SHOWN"" -> S,H,O,W,N -> allowed? S,H,O,W,N. Letters: S, H, O, W, N. None excluded? Excluded are C,R,A,E,I,G,T. So S,O,W are allowed. And H and N are in the word. So ""SHOWN"" is a valid word? But N is at position 5? And H at position 2? And we avoid position 4 for H? H is at 2, so position 4 is not H? So that's fine.

But we are putting N at position 5? That's a new position we haven't tried.

Also, we are testing S, O, W.

Another word: ""THORN"" but T and R excluded? Not allowed.

""CHAIN"" but C and A excluded? Not.

So ""SHOWN"" seems possible.

But let's check: S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5.

We know N is not at position 4? But we are putting it at 5? So that's fine.

Similarly, H is at 2, which is not position 4? So okay.

Now, with N at position 2: _ N _ _ _
And H at position 1: H N _ _ _ -> ""HNS??"" not common? ""HONEY"" but O,E,Y -> E excluded? Not.
""HANDY"" but A excluded? Not.

H at position 3: _ _ N H _ ? Like ""DINH?"" not a word.

H at position 5: _ N _ _ H -> ""UNH??"" ""UNHOLY"" but O,L,Y -> and U,N,H,O,L,Y? 6 letters? Not.

""INHAB"" not a word.

So ""SHOWN"" seems a good candidate.

Another option: N at position 3 and H at position 1: ""HUNKS"" as I thought earlier? H at 1, U at 2, N at 3, K at 4, S at 5.

But we are putting N at 3? That's allowed. H at 1? Allowed. And K at 4? We don't know about K. S at 5.

But we have to avoid putting H at position 4? We are not.

However, we are putting N at position 3? That's a new position.

But note: we are putting K at position 4? We don't know if that's a problem? It's a new letter.

But we are testing two new positions for N and H? Actually, we are testing position 1 for H and position 3 for N.

Also, we are testing U, K, S.

But ""HUNKS"" is a valid word? Yes.

Another word: ""HANKY"" but A excluded? Not.

""FUNKY"" but F,U,N,K,Y -> N at 3? F at 1, U at 2, N at 3, K at 4, Y at 5. But F is allowed? Yes, F is not excluded.

But ""FUNKY"" is a word? Yes.

But we have H to include? ""FUNKY"" doesn't have H? We must include H because it's in the word.

We must include both H and N.

So ""HUNKS"" has H and N.

Similarly, ""HUMUS"" but M,U,S -> and no N? Not.

So between ""SHOWN"" and ""HUNKS"", which is better?

""SHOWN"": tests S, H, O, W, N. H at position 2, N at position 5.
""HUNKS"": tests H, U, N, K, S. H at position 1, N at position 3.

We need to test H and N in new positions.

For H: we only know it's not at position 4. We haven't tested position 1,2,3,5? In ""night"", we tested H at position 4? So we know H is not at 4. We haven't tested other positions.

Similarly for N: we tested at position 1 and 4? In ""crane"" at 4, in ""night"" at 1? So we know not at 1 and 4. So positions 2,3,5 are possible.

In ""SHOWN"", we are testing H at position 2 and N at position 5? Both new positions.

In ""HUNKS"", we are testing H at position 1 and N at position 3? Also new.

Both are good.

But we also want to cover more common letters.

Common letters from available: S, L, O, U, D, P, B, M, etc.

""SHOWN"" has S, O, W? W is less common? But O is common.

""HUNKS"" has U, K, S? K is less common.

But both are acceptable.

Another word: ""SHUNT"" but T is excluded? Not allowed.

""PHONE"" but E excluded? Not.

""MOUTH"" but M,O,U,T,H -> T excluded? T is not allowed? From guess 2, T(x) so T is not in the word? So we cannot use T.

In ""SHOWN"", no T? Good.

In ""HUNKS"", no T? Good.

But we must not use T.

Another word: ""BOUND"" but B,O,U,N,D -> has N at position 4? Not allowed? We are avoiding N at 4? And also, no H? We must include H.

So not.

""FOUND"" same, no H.

""POUND"" same.

How about ""HOUND""? H,O,U,N,D -> but N at position 4? We are avoiding that? Because we know N is not at 4? So if we put N at 4, we get '-' and we don't learn the position? So it's better to avoid.

Therefore, I think ""SHOWN"" or ""HUNKS"" are good.

But let's see if we can find a word with L or other common letters.

For example, with N at position 2: ""SNOWY"" but S,N,O,W,Y -> no H? Must have H.

""SHINY"" but I excluded? Not.

""SLUNG"" but S,L,U,N,G -> G excluded? G is not allowed? From guess 2, G(x) so not in word? So cannot use G.

Similarly, ""CLUNG"" has C? Not.

So hard.

Another: ""JUMPS"" no H or N.

I think ""SHOWN"" is a good choice.

But ""SHOWN"" has W? And W is not very common? But it's acceptable.

Alternatively, ""HUSKY"" but no N? Not.

""BUNCH"" but C excluded? Not.

So I'll go with ""SHOWN"".

But in ""SHOWN"", we have H at position 2 and N at position 5? And we are testing S, O, W.

But we must ensure that we are not using any excluded letters: S, H, O, W, N. Excluded: C,R,A,E,I,G,T. So all are allowed.

Also, positions: N at 5? That's a new position we haven't tried? We tried N at 4 and 1? Now 5? So if we get a '-' for N, we know it's not at 5? Then it must be at 2 or 3? Similarly for H at 2: if we get a '-' for H, we know it's not at 2? Then H must be at 1,3,5? But we are testing position 2.

Actually, if we get a '✓' for H at 2, then we know position 2 is H. Similarly for N at 5.

If we get a '-' for H at 2, then H is in the word but not at 2? Then we know H is at 1,3, or 5? But we are testing position 2? So we get information.

Similarly for N.

So it's good.

But note: we are not testing position 3 at all? But that's okay.

Another word: ""HOWLS"" but H,O,W,L,S -> no N? Must have N.

Not.

""SOLID"" no H or N.

I think ""SHOWN"" is fine.

But let me think of a word that tests position 3 for N? For example, with N at 3.

Like ""PLUNK"" but P,L,U,N,K -> no H? Not.

""CLANK"" has C? Not.

""BLANK"" has B,L,A,N,K -> A excluded? Not.

""FLUNG"" has F,L,U,N,G -> G excluded? Not.

""JUMPY"" no H or N.

So ""HUNKS"" might be better because it tests N at position 3? Which is one of the possibilities.

In ""HUNKS"": H at 1, U at 2, N at 3, K at 4, S at 5.

We are testing:
- H at position 1: if ✓, then H is at 1; if -, then H is not at 1 but in the word? But we know H is in the word? So if we get x for H? But we know H is in the word? So it cannot be x? It must be either ✓ or -? Because it's in the word.

Similarly for N at 3: we know N is in the word? So it must be ✓ or -.

So we can get:

- If H at 1 is ✓, then we know position 1 is H.
- If H at 1 is -, then H is not at position 1? Then it must be at 2,3, or 5? But we are testing position 1? So we get information.

Similarly for N at 3: if ✓, then position 3 is N; if -, then N is not at 3? Then it must be at 2 or 5? Because we know not at 1 and 4.

Also, we are testing U, K, S.

But K and S are less common? But okay.

Another word: ""HOUND"" but N at 4? We avoid.

""POUND"" same.

""FOUND"" same.

""BOUND"" same.

""WOUND"" same.

""MOUNT"" has T? Not allowed.

""SOUTH"" has T? Not.

""LOUSE"" has E? Not.

I think ""HUNKS"" is acceptable.

But let's see if there is a word with O? O is common.

For example, ""HONED"" but E and D? E excluded? Not.

""SHONE"" has E? Not.

""PHONY"" has P,H,O,N,Y -> no E? But no H? H is at position 1? ""PHONY"": P(1),H(2),O(3),N(4),Y(5). But N at position 4? We are avoiding? Because we know N not at 4? So if we put N at 4, we get '-' and we don't learn? So not good.

Similarly, ""SHONE"" has E? Not.

""THONG"" has T and G? Not allowed.

So I think ""HUNKS"" or ""SHOWN"" are the best.

But in ""SHOWN"", we have O, which is common.

In ""HUNKS"", we have U and K, which are less common.

But both are valid.

Another word: ""BOWLS"" no H or N.

""SOLID"" no.

""DOZEN"" has E and Z? E excluded? Not.

""HOIST"" no N.

I think I'll go with ""SHOWN"" because it has O, which is a common vowel.

So guess: ""SHOWN""

But let's confirm the letters: S, H, O, W, N.

Excluded letters: C,R,A,E,I,G,T are not in, so S,H,O,W,N are all allowed.

And we are testing H at position 2 and N at position 5.

Also, S at 1, O at 3, W at 4.

So we get feedback on all.

If we get a '✓' for N at 5, then we know N is at 5? If not, then it's at 2 or 3.

Similarly for H at 2.

So it's good.

Therefore, I choose ""SHOWN"".

<guess>shown</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)  
  - C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.  
  - N is in the word but **not at position 4**.  

- **Guess 2: night** → N(-), I(x), G(x), H(-), T(x)  
  - N is in the word but **not at position 1** (since it was guessed at position 1 and got ""-"").  
  - I, G, T are **not** in the word.  
  - H is in the word but **not at position 4** (since it was guessed at position 4 and got ""-"").  

### Key Inferences:
- **Excluded letters (not in the word)**: C, R, A, E, I, G, T (9 letters).  
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: N and H.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - N cannot be at position 1 or 4 (from feedback). So N must be at position 2, 3, or 5.  
  - H cannot be at position 4 (from feedback). So H must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
- **Unknowns**: The secret word has 5 letters, so 3 additional letters (besides N and H) need to be discovered. These must come from the remaining available letters: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Must include N and H** to test their positions, avoiding known invalid positions:  
  - N: Not at 1 or 4 → test position 2, 3, or 5.  
  - H: Not at 4 → test position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
- **Avoid excluded letters** (C, R, A, E, I, G, T).  
- **Maximize information** by:  
  - Testing new positions for N and H (e.g., N at 5 or 3, H at 2 or 1).  
  - Including common unused letters (e.g., S, O, L, U, D) to increase coverage.  
- **Word choice**: ""SHOWN"" (S, H, O, W, N) is selected because:  
  - Contains both N and H.  
  - N is at position 5 (a new, untested position).  
  - H is at position 2 (a new, untested position).  
  - Tests new common letters: S (position 1), O (position 3), W (position 4).  
  - No excluded letters and all letters are distinct.  
  - If N at position 5 is correct, it will show ""✓""; if not, it will show ""-"" (narrowing N to position 2 or 3). Similarly, H at position 2 will provide positional feedback.",Guess 3: shown -> FEEDBACK: S(x) H(-) O(x) W(x) N(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,hunky,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).
   - It doesn't repeat any letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
N(-) -> N is in the word but in the wrong position.
E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter N, but not at the 4th position (since it was guessed as the 4th letter and got '-' meaning wrong position).
- The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word.

Also, note that our guess was ""crane"", which is valid.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We must choose a 5-letter English word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A, E (since they are not in the word).
- Does contain N (because N is present), but not in the 4th position.

Moreover, we can use common English words and try to cover other common letters.

Since N is in the word but not at position 4, N must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We also know that the word does not have C, R, A, E. So we avoid those letters.

Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Common vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

We should try to cover more common letters to get more feedback.

A good strategy is to use a word that includes N (since we know it's there) in a different position and uses other common letters.

Possible positions for N: We cannot put N at position 4, so we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We also want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

Let me think of words that:
1. Do not have C, R, A, E.
2. Have N, but not in the 4th position.
3. Contain other common letters.

Common letters in English: T, H, S, L, N, etc. But N is already known, so we can try T, H, S, L, O, etc.

For example:
- If we put N at the beginning: words like ""NIGHT"", ""NOISY"", etc. But we must avoid E and A, which we are avoiding.

Another idea: We can try ""HOIST"", but that doesn't have N? So we must include N.

A word with N: Let's list some words that have N and do not have C, R, A, E.

For instance:
- Position 1: N (so words starting with N). Examples: ""NIGHT"", ""NOISY"", ""NEXUS"" (but E is not allowed), not ""NEXUS"" because E is forbidden.

We cannot have E, so ""NIGHT"" has I,G,H,T -> no forbidden letters.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" said N is in the word but not at position 4. So if we put N at position 1 in our next word, that's allowed because it's a different position.

Similarly, we can try ""STUNG"", but has S,T,U,N,G -> doesn't have forbidden letters? But U is okay. Also, N is at position 4? But wait: the secret word's N is not at position 4, so if we put N at position 4 in our guess, it would be wrong position? Actually, it might be that the secret word has N at position 1, and if we put it at 4, we might get a '-', but we are going for a new word.

However, we need a word that includes N in a position that is not 4? Actually, no: our word can put N anywhere except position 4? No, we can put N anywhere, because the secret word's N is not necessarily in a fixed position. But note: the secret word has one N (we don't know if it has more, but let's assume no duplicates unless feedback shows otherwise). But the feedback only told us about one N.

Moreover, we should not use the position 4 for N because it was already guessed at position 4 and it was wrong, so we know N is not at position 4. But when we guess, we can still use N at position 4? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it won't be at position 4. But if we put N at position 4, we might get a '-' if the secret word has N elsewhere? So it's not a wasteful guess because it tests a different position? Actually, we already know N is not at position 4, so if we put N at a position where it might be, we get either '✓' or '-'. Whereas putting it at a position we haven't tried could give us new information.

So, let's avoid position 4 for N? Actually, we don't know that N must be avoided at position 4 in our guess? The rule is that the feedback is for the secret word: the secret word's N is not at position 4, so if we put N at position 4 in our guess, we will always get an 'x'? Because it's not at position 4 in the secret word and we have no clue about other positions? No:

Recall the feedback: In the guess ""crane"", the 4th letter N was marked as '-' meaning it is in the word but not at that position. Therefore, if we guess the same word again, we'd get the same feedback? But we are guessing a different word.

In our next guess, if we put N at position 4 again, we know it will not be correct (because it was already wrong), but it might still be '-' if the secret word has N somewhere else? Actually, that's what '-' means: the letter is in the word but wrong position. So if we put N at position 4 again, it will still show as '-', because we haven't found the spot? But we don't gain new information if we already know it's not position 4.

Instead, we should put N in a different position to test where it is.

Therefore, for the next guess, we should avoid putting N at position 4, and try one of the other positions: 1,2,3,5.

Given that, let me choose a word with N in a new position.

We also want to test other common consonants and vowels.

Possible words:

- If we put N at position 1: ""NIGHT"", ""NOISY"", ""NOTCH"" (but O,T,C,H -> but C is forbidden? C is forbidden? We had C(x) so not in word). So ""NOTCH"" has C? so invalid because C is not allowed.

Words starting with N without C,R,A,E: 
""NIHIL"" - not a word? Usually ""NIHIL"" is not common, but we need common words.
""NOBLY"" - N,O,B,L,Y -> doesn't have C,R,A,E -> valid.
""NOISY"" - N,O,I,S,Y -> valid.
""NIGHT"" - N,I,G,H,T -> valid and has common letters.

- Position 2: ... We can choose a word that has N in the second position? e.g., ""ONION"" but has O and I? but also O at position 1 and N at position 2 and 4? And we know N is at least once? But secret word might have multiple N? But we don't know. But ""ONION"" has N at 2 and 4. But position 4: we know N not at position 4? Actually, we know the secret word has N and it is not at position 4. But if we put an N at position 4 in the guess, it will be marked as 'x'? Because it's not at position 4? Or if the secret word has two N? Actually, we don't know. But it's safer to assume one N since we saw one feedback.

Moreover, we should avoid duplicate letters until we know more.

But if we use ""ONION"", we are placing N at position 2 and 4. Position 4 we know is wrong, so that N at 4 will likely be x (if there's no duplicate) or - if there is another N? But that's messy.

Since we are only required to give one word, let me pick a word without duplicates and with N not at position 4.

Options:
""NOBLY"": N,O,B,L,Y
""NOISY"": N,O,I,S,Y
""NIGHT"": N,I,G,H,T

Also, position 5: words ending in N: e.g., ""THORN"", but R is forbidden? R(x) from first feedback -> forbidden, so not.

""BROWN"" has R and W -> R not allowed? because R(x) in first guess -> not in secret word.

We must avoid R too.

We also avoid C, R, A, E.

So letters to avoid: C, R, A, E.

Therefore, for position 5: words ending with N without C,R,A,E: 
""DOWN"" -> 4 letters? 
""STAIN"" has A -> not allowed? A(x) so A not in word.
""MOURN"" has U,R -> R forbidden? and R? R is forbidden? So not.

Actually, words ending with N: ""BLOWN"" has B,L,O,W,N -> has W? But it does not have forbidden letters? But wait ""BLOWN"": W is okay? Not C,R,A,E? So valid.

But W is not very common? Maybe we can do better.

Another option: ""HOUND"" has H,O,U,N,D -> valid? and N at position 5? But U and H,D,O.

Which is best?

I think ""NIGHT"" is a good candidate:
- Starts with N (so tests position 1 for N? If it shows ✓, we know position 1 is N; if -, we know N is not at position 1 but at some other position and we have tested position 1; if x? but we know N is in the word so at worst we get '-'.)
- Also includes I (vowel), G, H, T (common consonants).

Alternatively, ""POINT"" has P,O,I,N,T -> but N at position 4? Position 4 is the forbidden position for N? We must avoid position 4? Actually, we are allowed to put N at position 4 again? But it will be marked as '-' again? Let me think:

In the secret word, N is in the word but not at position 4. So if we guess a word with N at position 4, we will get '-' (because N is in the word, just not at that position). So we wouldn't learn anything new about the location? Therefore, to avoid wasting a position, we should put N at a position we haven't tried.

Therefore, let's avoid position 4 for N.

For ""POINT"", the N is at position 4 -> so we avoid? Then we can't use it.

Similarly, ""BLOWN"" has N at position 5 -> that's new, so okay.

Another word: ""JOINT"" has N at position 4? Same problem.

So let's consider words that have N but not at position 4:

Possible positions: 1,2,3,5.

I have ""NIGHT"" (N at 1), ""BLOWN"" (N at 5), and also:

Position 2: e.g., ""SNOUT"" - S,N,O,U,T -> N at position 2? But S,N,O,U,T: avoid C,R,A,E -> yes? S,N,O,U,T: S at 1? This word tests S at position 1? Also has O, U, T.

But ""SNOUT"" includes S.

Another: ""UNTIL"" - U,N,T,I,L -> N at position 2? And has common letters.

But U is not very common? We should try to get more common letters.

I think ""NIGHT"" is a good choice: common and no forbidden letters.

But note: we must not use forbidden letters (C,R,A,E). ""NIGHT"" doesn't have them.

So I will go with ""NIGHT"".

Therefore, second guess: ""NIGHT""

<guess>night</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- N is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked with ""-""), meaning it must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 5 in the secret word.

For the second guess:
- Avoid using C, R, A, E.
- Include N, but **not in position 4** (since that position is already ruled out).
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., T, H, S, L, O, I, G, etc.) to maximize information.
- Choose a word with high letter diversity and no duplicates where possible.

The word **""night""** fits:
- Contains N (placed at position 1 to test a new location).
- Includes other common letters: I (vowel), G, H, T.
- No forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).
- All letters are distinct, allowing clear feedback.

This guess will help locate N and test four new letters simultaneously.

<guess>night</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: night -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(x) G(x) H(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, E are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not at position 4.

Guess 2: ""night"" -> N(-), I(x), G(x), H(-), T(x)
Meaning:
- N is in the word but not at position 1 (since we got '-' for N at position 1, meaning it's present but not here).
- I, G, T are not in the word (x).
- H is in the word but not at position 4 (since it was guessed at position 4 and got '-').

So, combining the information:

Letters not in the word: C, R, A, E, I, G, T
Letters in the word: N and H (and we know N is not at position 1 or 4, and H is not at position 4)

Also, from guess 1, N is not at position 4, and now from guess 2, N is not at position 1. So N must be at position 2, 3, or 5.

H is in the word and not at position 4. We don't know about other positions for H.

We have used 9 distinct letters that are not in the word: C, R, A, E, I, G, T. And we have two letters that are in: N and H.

The secret word has 5 letters, so there are 3 more letters to discover (since N and H are two of them).

We need to choose a new word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A, E, I, G, T (since they are not in the word)
- Must contain N and H (because they are in the word, and we want to find their positions)
- We should avoid putting N at position 1 or 4 (since we know it's not there) and H at position 4 (since we know it's not there). So for N, we can try position 2, 3, or 5; for H, we can try positions 1,2,3,5.

Also, we should try to cover new common letters to get more information.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the 9 excluded: 
Excluded: C, R, A, E, I, G, T
So available: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: H and N are already known to be in the word, so we must include them.

We can also try to use common letters from the available set: like S, L, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

We need to form a 5-letter word with H and N, and three other letters from the available set, without using the excluded letters.

Also, we should avoid positions that we know are wrong for N and H.

Specifically:
- N cannot be at position 1 or 4. So we can put N at 2, 3, or 5.
- H cannot be at position 4. So we can put H at 1,2,3,5.

But note: we don't want to put both in positions that might conflict? We just need to test.

We also want to maximize information by testing new positions for N and H and including new letters.

Possible words:

Let me think of words that have both H and N, and three other allowed letters.

For example:
- ""HOUND"": H,O,U,N,D -> but we have O,U,D. Are they allowed? O, U, D are not excluded? Yes. But note: ""HOUND"" has H at 1, O at 2, U at 3, N at 4, D at 5. But we cannot put N at position 4 because we know it's not at position 4? Actually, we can put it, but it will be marked as '-' again? Because we know it's not at 4. So we don't gain new information about N's position? Also, we are using a position we know is wrong. So it's better to avoid position 4 for N.

Therefore, we should choose a word where N is at position 2, 3, or 5.

Similarly, for H, avoid position 4.

So let's try to put N at position 2 or 3 or 5, and H at 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).

Option 1: N at position 2. Then we can have words like: _ N _ _ _
But we need H in the word. So for example, ""ONH??"" not a word.

Option 2: N at position 3: _ _ N _ _
Then we can have H at position 1: H _ N _ _
Or H at position 2: _ H N _ _
Or H at position 5: _ _ N _ H

Option 3: N at position 5: _ _ _ _ N
Then H can be at 1,2,3.

Let me think of actual words.

First, with N at position 3 and H at position 1: ""HUN??"" 
- ""HUNCH"" but C is excluded? Not allowed.
- ""HUNKS"" has K and S -> allowed? H,U,N,K,S -> but we have U,K,S. But ""HUNKS"" is a word? Yes, meaning a hunk of something. But N is at position 3? H(1),U(2),N(3),K(4),S(5). But we are putting N at 3, which is allowed. And H at 1. Also, K and S are new.

But note: we have to avoid position 4 for H? H is at 1, so that's fine. And N at 3 is new.

But we also have to avoid putting H at position 4? We are not.

Another word: ""HUSKY"" but no N? Not.

With N at position 3 and H at position 2: _ H N _ _
Like ""SHOWN"" but W and N? ""SHOWN"": S,H,O,W,N -> N is at position 5? Not 3.

""THINS"" but T is excluded? T is not allowed.

""CHINS"" but C excluded.

""PHONE"" but P,H,O,N,E -> E is excluded? E is not allowed.

""WHINY"" but W,H,I,N,Y -> I is excluded? I is not allowed.

So hard to find with H at 2 and N at 3.

Now, with N at position 3 and H at position 5: _ _ N _ H
Like ""BONKH"" not a word.
""PINCH"" but P,I,N,C,H -> I and C excluded? Not allowed.

Not many words.

Now, try N at position 5: _ _ _ _ N
With H at position 1: H _ _ _ N
Words: ""HUMAN"" but U,M,A -> A excluded? Not allowed.
""HEMAN"" not a word.
""HYMEN"" but Y,M,E -> E excluded? Not allowed.
""HOLLY"" no N? Not.

With H at position 2: _ H _ _ N
Like ""SHOWN"" -> S,H,O,W,N -> allowed? S,H,O,W,N. Letters: S, H, O, W, N. None excluded? Excluded are C,R,A,E,I,G,T. So S,O,W are allowed. And H and N are in the word. So ""SHOWN"" is a valid word? But N is at position 5? And H at position 2? And we avoid position 4 for H? H is at 2, so position 4 is not H? So that's fine.

But we are putting N at position 5? That's a new position we haven't tried.

Also, we are testing S, O, W.

Another word: ""THORN"" but T and R excluded? Not allowed.

""CHAIN"" but C and A excluded? Not.

So ""SHOWN"" seems possible.

But let's check: S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5.

We know N is not at position 4? But we are putting it at 5? So that's fine.

Similarly, H is at 2, which is not position 4? So okay.

Now, with N at position 2: _ N _ _ _
And H at position 1: H N _ _ _ -> ""HNS??"" not common? ""HONEY"" but O,E,Y -> E excluded? Not.
""HANDY"" but A excluded? Not.

H at position 3: _ _ N H _ ? Like ""DINH?"" not a word.

H at position 5: _ N _ _ H -> ""UNH??"" ""UNHOLY"" but O,L,Y -> and U,N,H,O,L,Y? 6 letters? Not.

""INHAB"" not a word.

So ""SHOWN"" seems a good candidate.

Another option: N at position 3 and H at position 1: ""HUNKS"" as I thought earlier? H at 1, U at 2, N at 3, K at 4, S at 5.

But we are putting N at 3? That's allowed. H at 1? Allowed. And K at 4? We don't know about K. S at 5.

But we have to avoid putting H at position 4? We are not.

However, we are putting N at position 3? That's a new position.

But note: we are putting K at position 4? We don't know if that's a problem? It's a new letter.

But we are testing two new positions for N and H? Actually, we are testing position 1 for H and position 3 for N.

Also, we are testing U, K, S.

But ""HUNKS"" is a valid word? Yes.

Another word: ""HANKY"" but A excluded? Not.

""FUNKY"" but F,U,N,K,Y -> N at 3? F at 1, U at 2, N at 3, K at 4, Y at 5. But F is allowed? Yes, F is not excluded.

But ""FUNKY"" is a word? Yes.

But we have H to include? ""FUNKY"" doesn't have H? We must include H because it's in the word.

We must include both H and N.

So ""HUNKS"" has H and N.

Similarly, ""HUMUS"" but M,U,S -> and no N? Not.

So between ""SHOWN"" and ""HUNKS"", which is better?

""SHOWN"": tests S, H, O, W, N. H at position 2, N at position 5.
""HUNKS"": tests H, U, N, K, S. H at position 1, N at position 3.

We need to test H and N in new positions.

For H: we only know it's not at position 4. We haven't tested position 1,2,3,5? In ""night"", we tested H at position 4? So we know H is not at 4. We haven't tested other positions.

Similarly for N: we tested at position 1 and 4? In ""crane"" at 4, in ""night"" at 1? So we know not at 1 and 4. So positions 2,3,5 are possible.

In ""SHOWN"", we are testing H at position 2 and N at position 5? Both new positions.

In ""HUNKS"", we are testing H at position 1 and N at position 3? Also new.

Both are good.

But we also want to cover more common letters.

Common letters from available: S, L, O, U, D, P, B, M, etc.

""SHOWN"" has S, O, W? W is less common? But O is common.

""HUNKS"" has U, K, S? K is less common.

But both are acceptable.

Another word: ""SHUNT"" but T is excluded? Not allowed.

""PHONE"" but E excluded? Not.

""MOUTH"" but M,O,U,T,H -> T excluded? T is not allowed? From guess 2, T(x) so T is not in the word? So we cannot use T.

In ""SHOWN"", no T? Good.

In ""HUNKS"", no T? Good.

But we must not use T.

Another word: ""BOUND"" but B,O,U,N,D -> has N at position 4? Not allowed? We are avoiding N at 4? And also, no H? We must include H.

So not.

""FOUND"" same, no H.

""POUND"" same.

How about ""HOUND""? H,O,U,N,D -> but N at position 4? We are avoiding that? Because we know N is not at 4? So if we put N at 4, we get '-' and we don't learn the position? So it's better to avoid.

Therefore, I think ""SHOWN"" or ""HUNKS"" are good.

But let's see if we can find a word with L or other common letters.

For example, with N at position 2: ""SNOWY"" but S,N,O,W,Y -> no H? Must have H.

""SHINY"" but I excluded? Not.

""SLUNG"" but S,L,U,N,G -> G excluded? G is not allowed? From guess 2, G(x) so not in word? So cannot use G.

Similarly, ""CLUNG"" has C? Not.

So hard.

Another: ""JUMPS"" no H or N.

I think ""SHOWN"" is a good choice.

But ""SHOWN"" has W? And W is not very common? But it's acceptable.

Alternatively, ""HUSKY"" but no N? Not.

""BUNCH"" but C excluded? Not.

So I'll go with ""SHOWN"".

But in ""SHOWN"", we have H at position 2 and N at position 5? And we are testing S, O, W.

But we must ensure that we are not using any excluded letters: S, H, O, W, N. Excluded: C,R,A,E,I,G,T. So all are allowed.

Also, positions: N at 5? That's a new position we haven't tried? We tried N at 4 and 1? Now 5? So if we get a '-' for N, we know it's not at 5? Then it must be at 2 or 3? Similarly for H at 2: if we get a '-' for H, we know it's not at 2? Then H must be at 1,3,5? But we are testing position 2.

Actually, if we get a '✓' for H at 2, then we know position 2 is H. Similarly for N at 5.

If we get a '-' for H at 2, then H is in the word but not at 2? Then we know H is at 1,3, or 5? But we are testing position 2? So we get information.

Similarly for N.

So it's good.

But note: we are not testing position 3 at all? But that's okay.

Another word: ""HOWLS"" but H,O,W,L,S -> no N? Must have N.

Not.

""SOLID"" no H or N.

I think ""SHOWN"" is fine.

But let me think of a word that tests position 3 for N? For example, with N at 3.

Like ""PLUNK"" but P,L,U,N,K -> no H? Not.

""CLANK"" has C? Not.

""BLANK"" has B,L,A,N,K -> A excluded? Not.

""FLUNG"" has F,L,U,N,G -> G excluded? Not.

""JUMPY"" no H or N.

So ""HUNKS"" might be better because it tests N at position 3? Which is one of the possibilities.

In ""HUNKS"": H at 1, U at 2, N at 3, K at 4, S at 5.

We are testing:
- H at position 1: if ✓, then H is at 1; if -, then H is not at 1 but in the word? But we know H is in the word? So if we get x for H? But we know H is in the word? So it cannot be x? It must be either ✓ or -? Because it's in the word.

Similarly for N at 3: we know N is in the word? So it must be ✓ or -.

So we can get:

- If H at 1 is ✓, then we know position 1 is H.
- If H at 1 is -, then H is not at position 1? Then it must be at 2,3, or 5? But we are testing position 1? So we get information.

Similarly for N at 3: if ✓, then position 3 is N; if -, then N is not at 3? Then it must be at 2 or 5? Because we know not at 1 and 4.

Also, we are testing U, K, S.

But K and S are less common? But okay.

Another word: ""HOUND"" but N at 4? We avoid.

""POUND"" same.

""FOUND"" same.

""BOUND"" same.

""WOUND"" same.

""MOUNT"" has T? Not allowed.

""SOUTH"" has T? Not.

""LOUSE"" has E? Not.

I think ""HUNKS"" is acceptable.

But let's see if there is a word with O? O is common.

For example, ""HONED"" but E and D? E excluded? Not.

""SHONE"" has E? Not.

""PHONY"" has P,H,O,N,Y -> no E? But no H? H is at position 1? ""PHONY"": P(1),H(2),O(3),N(4),Y(5). But N at position 4? We are avoiding? Because we know N not at 4? So if we put N at 4, we get '-' and we don't learn? So not good.

Similarly, ""SHONE"" has E? Not.

""THONG"" has T and G? Not allowed.

So I think ""HUNKS"" or ""SHOWN"" are the best.

But in ""SHOWN"", we have O, which is common.

In ""HUNKS"", we have U and K, which are less common.

But both are valid.

Another word: ""BOWLS"" no H or N.

""SOLID"" no.

""DOZEN"" has E and Z? E excluded? Not.

""HOIST"" no N.

I think I'll go with ""SHOWN"" because it has O, which is a common vowel.

So guess: ""SHOWN""

But let's confirm the letters: S, H, O, W, N.

Excluded letters: C,R,A,E,I,G,T are not in, so S,H,O,W,N are all allowed.

And we are testing H at position 2 and N at position 5.

Also, S at 1, O at 3, W at 4.

So we get feedback on all.

If we get a '✓' for N at 5, then we know N is at 5? If not, then it's at 2 or 3.

Similarly for H at 2.

So it's good.

Therefore, I choose ""SHOWN"".

<guess>shown</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)  
  - C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.  
  - N is in the word but **not at position 4**.  

- **Guess 2: night** → N(-), I(x), G(x), H(-), T(x)  
  - N is in the word but **not at position 1** (since it was guessed at position 1 and got ""-"").  
  - I, G, T are **not** in the word.  
  - H is in the word but **not at position 4** (since it was guessed at position 4 and got ""-"").  

### Key Inferences:
- **Excluded letters (not in the word)**: C, R, A, E, I, G, T (9 letters).  
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: N and H.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - N cannot be at position 1 or 4 (from feedback). So N must be at position 2, 3, or 5.  
  - H cannot be at position 4 (from feedback). So H must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
- **Unknowns**: The secret word has 5 letters, so 3 additional letters (besides N and H) need to be discovered. These must come from the remaining available letters: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Must include N and H** to test their positions, avoiding known invalid positions:  
  - N: Not at 1 or 4 → test position 2, 3, or 5.  
  - H: Not at 4 → test position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
- **Avoid excluded letters** (C, R, A, E, I, G, T).  
- **Maximize information** by:  
  - Testing new positions for N and H (e.g., N at 5 or 3, H at 2 or 1).  
  - Including common unused letters (e.g., S, O, L, U, D) to increase coverage.  
- **Word choice**: ""SHOWN"" (S, H, O, W, N) is selected because:  
  - Contains both N and H.  
  - N is at position 5 (a new, untested position).  
  - H is at position 2 (a new, untested position).  
  - Tests new common letters: S (position 1), O (position 3), W (position 4).  
  - No excluded letters and all letters are distinct.  
  - If N at position 5 is correct, it will show ""✓""; if not, it will show ""-"" (narrowing N to position 2 or 3). Similarly, H at position 2 will provide positional feedback.

Do not have C, R, A, E.\n2. Have N, but not in the 4th position.\n3. Contain other common letters.\n\nCommon letters in English: T, H, S, L, N, etc. But N is already known, so we can try T, H, S, L, O, etc.\n\nFor example:\n- If we put N at the beginning: words like ""NIGHT"", ""NOISY"", etc. But we must avoid E and A, which we are avoiding.\n\nAnother idea: We can try ""HOIST"", but that doesn\'t have N? So we must include N.\n\nA word with N: Let\'s list some words that have N and do not have C, R, A, E.\n\nFor instance:\n- Position 1: N (so words starting with N). Examples: ""NIGHT"", ""NOISY"", ""NEXUS"" (but E is not allowed), not ""NEXUS"" because E is forbidden.\n\nWe cannot have E, so ""NIGHT"" has I,G,H,T -> no forbidden letters.\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""crane"" said N is in the word but not at position 4. So if we put N at position 1 in our next word, that\'s allowed because it\'s a different position.\n\nSimilarly, we can try ""STUNG"", but has S,T,U,N,G -> doesn\'t have forbidden letters? But U is okay. Also, N is at position 4? But wait: the secret word\'s N is not at position 4, so if we put N at position 4 in our guess, it would be wrong position? Actually, it might be that the secret word has N at position 1, and if we put it at 4, we might get a \'-\', but we are going for a new word.\n\nHowever, we need a word that includes N in a position that is not 4? Actually, no: our word can put N anywhere except position 4? No, we can put N anywhere, because the secret word\'s N is not necessarily in a fixed position. But note: the secret word has one N (we don\'t know if it has more, but let\'s assume no duplicates unless feedback shows otherwise). But the feedback only told us about one N.\n\nMoreover, we should not use the position 4 for N because it was already guessed at position 4 and it was wrong, so we know N is not at position 4. But when we guess, we can still use N at position 4? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it won\'t be at position 4. But if we put N at position 4, we might get a \'-\' if the secret word has N elsewhere? So it\'s not a wasteful guess because it tests a different position? Actually, we already know N is not at position 4, so if we put N at a position where it might be, we get either \'✓\' or \'-\'. Whereas putting it at a position we haven\'t tried could give us new information.\n\nSo, let\'s avoid position 4 for N? Actually, we don\'t know that N must be avoided at position 4 in our guess? The rule is that the feedback is for the secret word: the secret word\'s N is not at position 4, so if we put N at position 4 in our guess, we will always get an \'x\'? Because it\'s not at position 4 in the secret word and we have no clue about other positions? No:\n\nRecall the feedback: In the guess ""crane"", the 4th letter N was marked as \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not at that position. Therefore, if we guess the same word again, we\'d get the same feedback? But we are guessing a different word.\n\nIn our next guess, if we put N at position 4 again, we know it will not be correct (because it was already wrong), but it might still be \'-\' if the secret word has N somewhere else? Actually, that\'s what \'-\' means: the letter is in the word but wrong position. So if we put N at position 4 again, it will still show as \'-\', because we haven\'t found the spot? But we don\'t gain new information if we already know it\'s not position 4.\n\nInstead, we should put N in a different position to test where it is.\n\nTherefore, for the next guess, we should avoid putting N at position 4, and try one of the other positions: 1,2,3,5.\n\nGiven that, let me choose a word with N in a new position.\n\nWe also want to test other common consonants and vowels.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- If we put N at position 1: ""NIGHT"", ""NOISY"", ""NOTCH"" (but O,T,C,H -> but C is forbidden? C is forbidden? We had C(x) so not in word). So ""NOTCH"" has C? so invalid because C is not allowed.\n\nWords starting with N without C,R,A,E: \n""NIHIL"" - not a word? Usually ""NIHIL"" is not common, but we need common words.\n""NOBLY"" - N,O,B,L,Y -> doesn\'t have C,R,A,E -> valid.\n""NOISY"" - N,O,I,S,Y -> valid.\n""NIGHT"" - N,I,G,H,T -> valid and has common letters.\n\n- Position 2: ... We can choose a word that has N in the second position? e.g., ""ONION"" but has O and I? but also O at position 1 and N at position 2 and 4? And we know N is at least once? But secret word might have multiple N? But we don\'t know. But ""ONION"" has N at 2 and 4. But position 4: we know N not at position 4? Actually, we know the secret word has N and it is not at position 4. But if we put an N at position 4 in the guess, it will be marked as \'x\'? Because it\'s not at position 4? Or if the secret word has two N? Actually, we don\'t know. But it\'s safer to assume one N since we saw one feedback.\n\nMoreover, we should avoid duplicate letters until we know more.\n\nBut if we use ""ONION"", we are placing N at position 2 and 4. Position 4 we know is wrong, so that N at 4 will likely be x (if there\'s no duplicate) or - if there is another N? But that\'s messy.\n\nSince we are only required to give one word, let me pick a word without duplicates and with N not at position 4.\n\nOptions:\n""NOBLY"": N,O,B,L,Y\n""NOISY"": N,O,I,S,Y\n""NIGHT"": N,I,G,H,T\n\nAlso, position 5: words ending in N: e.g., ""THORN"", but R is forbidden? R(x) from first feedback -> forbidden, so not.\n\n""BROWN"" has R and W -> R not allowed? because R(x) in first guess -> not in secret word.\n\nWe must avoid R too.\n\nWe also avoid C, R, A, E.\n\nSo letters to avoid: C, R, A, E.\n\nTherefore, for position 5: words ending with N without C,R,A,E: \n""DOWN"" -> 4 letters? \n""STAIN"" has A -> not allowed? A(x) so A not in word.\n""MOURN"" has U,R -> R forbidden? and R? R is forbidden? So not.\n\nActually, words ending with N: ""BLOWN"" has B,L,O,W,N -> has W? But it does not have forbidden letters? But wait ""BLOWN"": W is okay? Not C,R,A,E? So valid.\n\nBut W is not very common? Maybe we can do better.\n\nAnother option: ""HOUND"" has H,O,U,N,D -> valid? and N at position 5? But U and H,D,O.\n\nWhich is best?\n\nI think ""NIGHT"" is a good candidate:\n- Starts with N (so tests position 1 for N? If it shows ✓, we know position 1 is N; if -, we know N is not at position 1 but at some other position and we have tested position 1; if x? but we know N is in the word so at worst we get \'-\'.)\n- Also includes I (vowel), G, H, T (common consonants).\n\nAlternatively, ""POINT"" has P,O,I,N,T -> but N at position 4? Position 4 is the forbidden position for N? We must avoid position 4? Actually, we are allowed to put N at position 4 again? But it will be marked as \'-\' again? Let me think:\n\nIn the secret word, N is in the word but not at position 4. So if we guess a word with N at position 4, we will get \'-\' (because N is in the word, just not at that position). So we wouldn\'t learn anything new about the location? Therefore, to avoid wasting a position, we should put N at a position we haven\'t tried.\n\nTherefore, let\'s avoid position 4 for N.\n\nFor ""POINT"", the N is at position 4 -> so we avoid? Then we can\'t use it.\n\nSimilarly, ""BLOWN"" has N at position 5 -> that\'s new, so okay.\n\nAnother word: ""JOINT"" has N at position 4? Same problem.\n\nSo let\'s consider words that have N but not at position 4:\n\nPossible positions: 1,2,3,5.\n\nI have ""NIGHT"" (N at 1), ""BLOWN"" (N at 5), and also:\n\nPosition 2: e.g., ""SNOUT"" - S,N,O,U,T -> N at position 2? But S,N,O,U,T: avoid C,R,A,E -> yes? S,N,O,U,T: S at 1? This word tests S at position 1? Also has O, U, T.\n\nBut ""SNOUT"" includes S.\n\nAnother: ""UNTIL"" - U,N,T,I,L -> N at position 2? And has common letters.\n\nBut U is not very common? We should try to get more common letters.\n\nI think ""NIGHT"" is a good choice: common and no forbidden letters.\n\nBut note: we must not use forbidden letters (C,R,A,E). ""NIGHT"" doesn\'t have them.\n\nSo I will go with ""NIGHT"".\n\nTherefore, second guess: ""NIGHT""\n\n<guess>night</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": \n- C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x"").\n- N is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked with ""-""), meaning it must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 5 in the secret word.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Avoid using C, R, A, E.\n- Include N, but **not in position 4** (since that position is already ruled out).\n- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., T, H, S, L, O, I, G, etc.) to maximize information.\n- Choose a word with high letter diversity and no duplicates where possible.\n\nThe word **""night""** fits:\n- Contains N (placed at position 1 to test a new location).\n- Includes other common letters: I (vowel), G, H, T.\n- No forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).\n- All letters are distinct, allowing clear feedback.\n\nThis guess will help locate N and test four new letters simultaneously.\n\n<guess>night</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: night -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(x) G(x) H(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, A, E are not in the secret word.\n- N is in the word but not at position 4.\n\nGuess 2: ""night"" -> N(-), I(x), G(x), H(-), T(x)\nMeaning:\n- N is in the word but not at position 1 (since we got \'-\' for N at position 1, meaning it\'s present but not here).\n- I, G, T are not in the word (x).\n- H is in the word but not at position 4 (since it was guessed at position 4 and got \'-\').\n\nSo, combining the information:\n\nLetters not in the word: C, R, A, E, I, G, T\nLetters in the word: N and H (and we know N is not at position 1 or 4, and H is not at position 4)\n\nAlso, from guess 1, N is not at position 4, and now from guess 2, N is not at position 1. So N must be at position 2, 3, or 5.\n\nH is in the word and not at position 4. We don\'t know about other positions for H.\n\nWe have used 9 distinct letters that are not in the word: C, R, A, E, I, G, T. And we have two letters that are in: N and H.\n\nThe secret word has 5 letters, so there are 3 more letters to discover (since N and H are two of them).\n\nWe need to choose a new word that:\n- Does not contain C, R, A, E, I, G, T (since they are not in the word)\n- Must contain N and H (because they are in the word, and we want to find their positions)\n- We should avoid putting N at position 1 or 4 (since we know it\'s not there) and H at position 4 (since we know it\'s not there). So for N, we can try position 2, 3, or 5; for H, we can try positions 1,2,3,5.\n\nAlso, we should try to cover new common letters to get more information.\n\nAvailable letters: We have 26 letters minus the 9 excluded: \nExcluded: C, R, A, E, I, G, T\nSo available: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut note: H and N are already known to be in the word, so we must include them.\n\nWe can also try to use common letters from the available set: like S, L, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word with H and N, and three other letters from the available set, without using the excluded letters.\n\nAlso, we should avoid positions that we know are wrong for N and H.\n\nSpecifically:\n- N cannot be at position 1 or 4. So we can put N at 2, 3, or 5.\n- H cannot be at position 4. So we can put H at 1,2,3,5.\n\nBut note: we don\'t want to put both in positions that might conflict? We just need to test.\n\nWe also want to maximize information by testing new positions for N and H and including new letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\nLet me think of words that have both H and N, and three other allowed letters.\n\nFor example:\n- ""HOUND"": H,O,U,N,D -> but we have O,U,D. Are they allowed? O, U, D are not excluded? Yes. But note: ""HOUND"" has H at 1, O at 2, U at 3, N at 4, D at 5. But we cannot put N at position 4 because we know it\'s not at position 4? Actually, we can put it, but it will be marked as \'-\' again? Because we know it\'s not at 4. So we don\'t gain new information about N\'s position? Also, we are using a position we know is wrong. So it\'s better to avoid position 4 for N.\n\nTherefore, we should choose a word where N is at position 2, 3, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, for H, avoid position 4.\n\nSo let\'s try to put N at position 2 or 3 or 5, and H at 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).\n\nOption 1: N at position 2. Then we can have words like: _ N _ _ _\nBut we need H in the word. So for example, ""ONH??"" not a word.\n\nOption 2: N at position 3: _ _ N _ _\nThen we can have H at position 1: H _ N _ _\nOr H at position 2: _ H N _ _\nOr H at position 5: _ _ N _ H\n\nOption 3: N at position 5: _ _ _ _ N\nThen H can be at 1,2,3.\n\nLet me think of actual words.\n\nFirst, with N at position 3 and H at position 1: ""HUN??"" \n- ""HUNCH"" but C is excluded? Not allowed.\n- ""HUNKS"" has K and S -> allowed? H,U,N,K,S -> but we have U,K,S. But ""HUNKS"" is a word? Yes, meaning a hunk of something. But N is at position 3? H(1),U(2),N(3),K(4),S(5). But we are putting N at 3, which is allowed. And H at 1. Also, K and S are new.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid position 4 for H? H is at 1, so that\'s fine. And N at 3 is new.\n\nBut we also have to avoid putting H at position 4? We are not.\n\nAnother word: ""HUSKY"" but no N? Not.\n\nWith N at position 3 and H at position 2: _ H N _ _\nLike ""SHOWN"" but W and N? ""SHOWN"": S,H,O,W,N -> N is at position 5? Not 3.\n\n""THINS"" but T is excluded? T is not allowed.\n\n""CHINS"" but C excluded.\n\n""PHONE"" but P,H,O,N,E -> E is excluded? E is not allowed.\n\n""WHINY"" but W,H,I,N,Y -> I is excluded? I is not allowed.\n\nSo hard to find with H at 2 and N at 3.\n\nNow, with N at position 3 and H at position 5: _ _ N _ H\nLike ""BONKH"" not a word.\n""PINCH"" but P,I,N,C,H -> I and C excluded? Not allowed.\n\nNot many words.\n\nNow, try N at position 5: _ _ _ _ N\nWith H at position 1: H _ _ _ N\nWords: ""HUMAN"" but U,M,A -> A excluded? Not allowed.\n""HEMAN"" not a word.\n""HYMEN"" but Y,M,E -> E excluded? Not allowed.\n""HOLLY"" no N? Not.\n\nWith H at position 2: _ H _ _ N\nLike ""SHOWN"" -> S,H,O,W,N -> allowed? S,H,O,W,N. Letters: S, H, O, W, N. None excluded? Excluded are C,R,A,E,I,G,T. So S,O,W are allowed. And H and N are in the word. So ""SHOWN"" is a valid word? But N is at position 5? And H at position 2? And we avoid position 4 for H? H is at 2, so position 4 is not H? So that\'s fine.\n\nBut we are putting N at position 5? That\'s a new position we haven\'t tried.\n\nAlso, we are testing S, O, W.\n\nAnother word: ""THORN"" but T and R excluded? Not allowed.\n\n""CHAIN"" but C and A excluded? Not.\n\nSo ""SHOWN"" seems possible.\n\nBut let\'s check: S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5.\n\nWe know N is not at position 4? But we are putting it at 5? So that\'s fine.\n\nSimilarly, H is at 2, which is not position 4? So okay.\n\nNow, with N at position 2: _ N _ _ _\nAnd H at position 1: H N _ _ _ -> ""HNS??"" not common? ""HONEY"" but O,E,Y -> E excluded? Not.\n""HANDY"" but A excluded? Not.\n\nH at position 3: _ _ N H _ ? Like ""DINH?"" not a word.\n\nH at position 5: _ N _ _ H -> ""UNH??"" ""UNHOLY"" but O,L,Y -> and U,N,H,O,L,Y? 6 letters? Not.\n\n""INHAB"" not a word.\n\nSo ""SHOWN"" seems a good candidate.\n\nAnother option: N at position 3 and H at position 1: ""HUNKS"" as I thought earlier? H at 1, U at 2, N at 3, K at 4, S at 5.\n\nBut we are putting N at 3? That\'s allowed. H at 1? Allowed. And K at 4? We don\'t know about K. S at 5.\n\nBut we have to avoid putting H at position 4? We are not.\n\nHowever, we are putting N at position 3? That\'s a new position.\n\nBut note: we are putting K at position 4? We don\'t know if that\'s a problem? It\'s a new letter.\n\nBut we are testing two new positions for N and H? Actually, we are testing position 1 for H and position 3 for N.\n\nAlso, we are testing U, K, S.\n\nBut ""HUNKS"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\nAnother word: ""HANKY"" but A excluded? Not.\n\n""FUNKY"" but F,U,N,K,Y -> N at 3? F at 1, U at 2, N at 3, K at 4, Y at 5. But F is allowed? Yes, F is not excluded.\n\nBut ""FUNKY"" is a word? Yes.\n\nBut we have H to include? ""FUNKY"" doesn\'t have H? We must include H because it\'s in the word.\n\nWe must include both H and N.\n\nSo ""HUNKS"" has H and N.\n\nSimilarly, ""HUMUS"" but M,U,S -> and no N? Not.\n\nSo between ""SHOWN"" and ""HUNKS"", which is better?\n\n""SHOWN"": tests S, H, O, W, N. H at position 2, N at position 5.\n""HUNKS"": tests H, U, N, K, S. H at position 1, N at position 3.\n\nWe need to test H and N in new positions.\n\nFor H: we only know it\'s not at position 4. We haven\'t tested position 1,2,3,5? In ""night"", we tested H at position 4? So we know H is not at 4. We haven\'t tested other positions.\n\nSimilarly for N: we tested at position 1 and 4? In ""crane"" at 4, in ""night"" at 1? So we know not at 1 and 4. So positions 2,3,5 are possible.\n\nIn ""SHOWN"", we are testing H at position 2 and N at position 5? Both new positions.\n\nIn ""HUNKS"", we are testing H at position 1 and N at position 3? Also new.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nBut we also want to cover more common letters.\n\nCommon letters from available: S, L, O, U, D, P, B, M, etc.\n\n""SHOWN"" has S, O, W? W is less common? But O is common.\n\n""HUNKS"" has U, K, S? K is less common.\n\nBut both are acceptable.\n\nAnother word: ""SHUNT"" but T is excluded? Not allowed.\n\n""PHONE"" but E excluded? Not.\n\n""MOUTH"" but M,O,U,T,H -> T excluded? T is not allowed? From guess 2, T(x) so T is not in the word? So we cannot use T.\n\nIn ""SHOWN"", no T? Good.\n\nIn ""HUNKS"", no T? Good.\n\nBut we must not use T.\n\nAnother word: ""BOUND"" but B,O,U,N,D -> has N at position 4? Not allowed? We are avoiding N at 4? And also, no H? We must include H.\n\nSo not.\n\n""FOUND"" same, no H.\n\n""POUND"" same.\n\nHow about ""HOUND""? H,O,U,N,D -> but N at position 4? We are avoiding that? Because we know N is not at 4? So if we put N at 4, we get \'-\' and we don\'t learn the position? So it\'s better to avoid.\n\nTherefore, I think ""SHOWN"" or ""HUNKS"" are good.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can find a word with L or other common letters.\n\nFor example, with N at position 2: ""SNOWY"" but S,N,O,W,Y -> no H? Must have H.\n\n""SHINY"" but I excluded? Not.\n\n""SLUNG"" but S,L,U,N,G -> G excluded? G is not allowed? From guess 2, G(x) so not in word? So cannot use G.\n\nSimilarly, ""CLUNG"" has C? Not.\n\nSo hard.\n\nAnother: ""JUMPS"" no H or N.\n\nI think ""SHOWN"" is a good choice.\n\nBut ""SHOWN"" has W? And W is not very common? But it\'s acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, ""HUSKY"" but no N? Not.\n\n""BUNCH"" but C excluded? Not.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SHOWN"".\n\nBut in ""SHOWN"", we have H at position 2 and N at position 5? And we are testing S, O, W.\n\nBut we must ensure that we are not using any excluded letters: S, H, O, W, N. Excluded: C,R,A,E,I,G,T. So all are allowed.\n\nAlso, positions: N at 5? That\'s a new position we haven\'t tried? We tried N at 4 and 1? Now 5? So if we get a \'-\' for N, we know it\'s not at 5? Then it must be at 2 or 3? Similarly for H at 2: if we get a \'-\' for H, we know it\'s not at 2? Then H must be at 1,3,5? But we are testing position 2.\n\nActually, if we get a \'✓\' for H at 2, then we know position 2 is H. Similarly for N at 5.\n\nIf we get a \'-\' for H at 2, then H is in the word but not at 2? Then we know H is at 1,3, or 5? But we are testing position 2? So we get information.\n\nSimilarly for N.\n\nSo it\'s good.\n\nBut note: we are not testing position 3 at all? But that\'s okay.\n\nAnother word: ""HOWLS"" but H,O,W,L,S -> no N? Must have N.\n\nNot.\n\n""SOLID"" no H or N.\n\nI think ""SHOWN"" is fine.\n\nBut let me think of a word that tests position 3 for N? For example, with N at 3.\n\nLike ""PLUNK"" but P,L,U,N,K -> no H? Not.\n\n""CLANK"" has C? Not.\n\n""BLANK"" has B,L,A,N,K -> A excluded? Not.\n\n""FLUNG"" has F,L,U,N,G -> G excluded? Not.\n\n""JUMPY"" no H or N.\n\nSo ""HUNKS"" might be better because it tests N at position 3? Which is one of the possibilities.\n\nIn ""HUNKS"": H at 1, U at 2, N at 3, K at 4, S at 5.\n\nWe are testing:\n- H at position 1: if ✓, then H is at 1; if -, then H is not at 1 but in the word? But we know H is in the word? So if we get x for H? But we know H is in the word? So it cannot be x? It must be either ✓ or -? Because it\'s in the word.\n\nSimilarly for N at 3: we know N is in the word? So it must be ✓ or -.\n\nSo we can get:\n\n- If H at 1 is ✓, then we know position 1 is H.\n- If H at 1 is -, then H is not at position 1? Then it must be at 2,3, or 5? But we are testing position 1? So we get information.\n\nSimilarly for N at 3: if ✓, then position 3 is N; if -, then N is not at 3? Then it must be at 2 or 5? Because we know not at 1 and 4.\n\nAlso, we are testing U, K, S.\n\nBut K and S are less common? But okay.\n\nAnother word: ""HOUND"" but N at 4? We avoid.\n\n""POUND"" same.\n\n""FOUND"" same.\n\n""BOUND"" same.\n\n""WOUND"" same.\n\n""MOUNT"" has T? Not allowed.\n\n""SOUTH"" has T? Not.\n\n""LOUSE"" has E? Not.\n\nI think ""HUNKS"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word with O? O is common.\n\nFor example, ""HONED"" but E and D? E excluded? Not.\n\n""SHONE"" has E? Not.\n\n""PHONY"" has P,H,O,N,Y -> no E? But no H? H is at position 1? ""PHONY"": P(1),H(2),O(3),N(4),Y(5). But N at position 4? We are avoiding? Because we know N not at 4? So if we put N at 4, we get \'-\' and we don\'t learn? So not good.\n\nSimilarly, ""SHONE"" has E? Not.\n\n""THONG"" has T and G? Not allowed.\n\nSo I think ""HUNKS"" or ""SHOWN"" are the best.\n\nBut in ""SHOWN"", we have O, which is common.\n\nIn ""HUNKS"", we have U and K, which are less common.\n\nBut both are valid.\n\nAnother word: ""BOWLS"" no H or N.\n\n""SOLID"" no.\n\n""DOZEN"" has E and Z? E excluded? Not.\n\n""HOIST"" no N.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""SHOWN"" because it has O, which is a common vowel.\n\nSo guess: ""SHOWN""\n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters: S, H, O, W, N.\n\nExcluded letters: C,R,A,E,I,G,T are not in, so S,H,O,W,N are all allowed.\n\nAnd we are testing H at position 2 and N at position 5.\n\nAlso, S at 1, O at 3, W at 4.\n\nSo we get feedback on all.\n\nIf we get a \'✓\' for N at 5, then we know N is at 5? If not, then it\'s at 2 or 3.\n\nSimilarly for H at 2.\n\nSo it\'s good.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""SHOWN"".\n\n<guess>shown</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)  \n  - C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.  \n  - N is in the word but **not at position 4**.  \n\n- **Guess 2: night** → N(-), I(x), G(x), H(-), T(x)  \n  - N is in the word but **not at position 1** (since it was guessed at position 1 and got ""-"").  \n  - I, G, T are **not** in the word.  \n  - H is in the word but **not at position 4** (since it was guessed at position 4 and got ""-"").  \n\n### Key Inferences:\n- **Excluded letters (not in the word)**: C, R, A, E, I, G, T (9 letters).  \n- **Confirmed letters in the word**: N and H.  \n- **Position constraints**:  \n  - N cannot be at position 1 or 4 (from feedback). So N must be at position 2, 3, or 5.  \n  - H cannot be at position 4 (from feedback). So H must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  \n- **Unknowns**: The secret word has 5 letters, so 3 additional letters (besides N and H) need to be discovered. These must come from the remaining available letters: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- **Must include N and H** to test their positions, avoiding known invalid positions:  \n  - N: Not at 1 or 4 → test position 2, 3, or 5.  \n  - H: Not at 4 → test position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  \n- **Avoid excluded letters** (C, R, A, E, I, G, T).  \n- **Maximize information** by:  \n  - Testing new positions for N and H (e.g., N at 5 or 3, H at 2 or 1).  \n  - Including common unused letters (e.g., S, O, L, U, D) to increase coverage.  \n- **Word choice**: ""SHOWN"" (S, H, O, W, N) is selected because:  \n  - Contains both N and H.  \n  - N is at position 5 (a new, untested position).  \n  - H is at position 2 (a new, untested position).  \n  - Tests new common letters: S (position 1), O (position 3), W (position 4).  \n  - No excluded letters and all letters are distinct.  \n  - If N at position 5 is correct, it will show ""✓""; if not, it will show ""-"" (narrowing N to position 2 or 3). Similarly, H at position 2 will provide positional feedback.\n\n<guess>shown</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: night -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(x) G(x) H(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: shown -> FEEDBACK: S(x) H(-) O(x) W(x) N(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Meaning: C, R, A, E are not in the word. N is in the word but not at position 4.

Guess 2: ""night"" -> N(-) I(x) G(x) H(-) T(x)
Meaning: N is in the word but not at position 1. I, G, T are not in the word. H is in the word but not at position 4.

Guess 3: ""shown"" -> S(x) H(-) O(x) W(x) N(-)
Meaning: S, O, W are not in the word. H is in the word but not at position 2. N is in the word but not at position 5.

Now, combining all:

Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, A, E, I, G, T, S, O, W (from all three guesses). So excluded: C, R, A, E, I, G, T, S, O, W.

Confirmed letters in the word: N and H (from previous feedback, and they are still in because we got '-' for them in guess 3, meaning they are present but not at the guessed positions).

Position constraints for N:
- Not at position 1 (from guess 2: N at position 1 got '-')
- Not at position 4 (from guess 1: N at position 4 got '-')
- Not at position 5 (from guess 3: N at position 5 got '-')

Therefore, N must be at position 2 or 3 (since only positions 2 and 3 are left for a 5-letter word).

Position constraints for H:
- Not at position 4 (from guess 2: H at position 4 got '-')
- Not at position 2 (from guess 3: H at position 2 got '-')
- We don't have information about positions 1, 3, or 5 for H.

Therefore, H must be at position 1, 3, or 5.

But note: the word has 5 positions, and we have two letters: N and H. So there are three more letters to find.

Available letters: We have excluded 10 letters: C, R, A, E, I, G, T, S, O, W. So available: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word that:
- Contains N and H (both must be present).
- N is at position 2 or 3.
- H is at position 1, 3, or 5 (but note: if N is at 3, then H cannot be at 3? Because we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But in the feedback, we haven't seen duplicates, so we assume no duplicates? The feedback doesn't show duplicates? Actually, the feedback might show multiple of the same letter? But in this case, we have no indication of duplicates. So we assume each letter appears once? Therefore, N and H are distinct and in different positions.

So, if N is at position 2, then H can be at 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2, obviously).
If N is at position 3, then H can be at 1 or 5 (not 3, and not 2 because we know H not at 2).

Also, we have three other positions to fill with letters from the available set.

We need to choose a word that tests the possible positions for N and H and includes new letters.

Let's consider the possibilities:

Case 1: N at position 2.
Then the word: _ N _ _ _
H can be at 1, 3, or 5.

But if H at 1: H N _ _ _
If H at 3: _ N H _ _
If H at 5: _ N _ _ H

Case 2: N at position 3.
Then the word: _ _ N _ _
H can be at 1 or 5 (since not at 2,3,4).
If H at 1: H _ N _ _
If H at 5: _ _ N _ H

We need to find actual words that fit these patterns and use only available letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We should prioritize common letters to increase chances: like L, D, U, P, M, B, etc.

Let's try to find words:

First, with N at position 2:

- If H at 1: ""H N _ _ _""
  Words: ""HND??"" not common. ""HANDY"" but A excluded? Not. ""HONEY"" but O and E excluded? Not. ""HUNKY"" but U,K,Y -> but we have U,K,Y allowed? But ""HUNKY"": H,U,N,K,Y -> U at 3, K at 4, Y at 5. But N is at 2? H(1),N(2),U(3),K(4),Y(5). But we have to check if U,K,Y are allowed? Yes, they are not excluded. And no duplicates? So ""HUNKY"" is a word? Yes, meaning healthy and strong.

  But note: we have H at position 1? And we are testing it? We know H is in the word, but we don't know its position. So if we put H at 1, we might get a '✓' or '-'.

  Similarly, N at 2: we are testing position 2 for N? If it's correct, we get '✓'; if not, we get '-' and then N must be at 3? But we are testing N at 2? So if we get a '-' for N at 2, then N must be at 3? Because only two possibilities.

  So ""HUNKY"" seems a candidate.

- If H at 3: ""_ N H _ _""
  Words: ""UNHIP"" but U,N,H,I,P -> I excluded? Not. ""INHUM"" not a word. ""ANH??"" not. Hard to find.

- If H at 5: ""_ N _ _ H""
  Words: ""UNFIX"" but U,N,F,I,X -> I excluded? Not. ""UNZIP"" has Z,I -> I excluded? Not. ""UNMIX"" has I? Not. ""UNDUH"" not a word. Hard.

So ""HUNKY"" is a good candidate for N at 2 and H at 1.

Now, with N at position 3:

- If H at 1: ""H _ N _ _""
  Words: ""HIND?"" but I excluded? ""HAND"" has A? Not. ""HONE"" has O,E? Not. ""HUNK"" but 4 letters? We need 5. ""HUMAN"" has A? Not. ""HYMNS"" has Y,M,N,S -> but S excluded? S is excluded? From guess 3, S(x) so not in word? So cannot use S. ""HUMPS"" has U,M,P,S -> S excluded? Not. ""HUMUS"" has U,M,S -> S excluded? Not. ""HUTCH"" has U,T,C,H -> T and C excluded? Not. Hard.

  ""HUMAN"" not allowed.

  ""HYPNO"" but P,N,O -> O excluded? Not.

  ""HUBBY"" has U,B,B -> duplicates? But B twice? And Y. But ""HUBBY"" is a word? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But in feedback, we haven't seen duplicates? But we can try? But let's avoid for now.

  Actually, we can use duplicates? But the feedback would show if a letter is repeated? But in this case, we have no duplicate letters in the feedback so far? So we assume no duplicates? Or we can have? But to be safe, let's avoid duplicates.

  So ""H _ N _ _"" without duplicates and without excluded letters.

  ""HUMAN"" not allowed.

  ""HELIX"" has E,L,I,X -> E and I excluded? Not.

  ""HAVOC"" has A,V,O,C -> A,O,C excluded? Not.

  Hard to find.

- If H at 5: ""_ _ N _ H""
  Words: ""BUNCH"" but C excluded? Not. ""LUNCH"" same. ""DUNCH"" not common. ""FUNKY"" but F,U,N,K,Y -> but no H? We need H at 5? ""FUNKY"" has no H? So not.

  ""PUNCH"" has P,U,N,C,H -> C excluded? Not.

  ""MUNCH"" has M,U,N,C,H -> C excluded? Not.

  ""BUNCH"" same.

  ""LINEN"" has L,I,N,E,N -> I and E excluded? And duplicate N? Not.

  ""MINIM"" has I,M -> I excluded? Not.

  Hard.

So the only viable word I found is ""HUNKY"" for the case N at 2 and H at 1.

But let's confirm: ""HUNKY"" - H at 1, U at 2? No: H at 1, N at 2, U at 3, K at 4, Y at 5.

But we are testing N at position 2? And H at position 1.

Also, U, K, Y are new letters.

Now, if we get feedback:
- If H at 1 is correct, we get ✓ for H.
- If not, we get - for H? But we know H is in the word? So if not at 1, then it must be at 3 or 5? But in this word, we don't have H at other positions? So we get - for H at 1, meaning H is not at 1? Then we know H must be at 3 or 5? But we are not testing those? So we would need another guess.

Similarly for N at 2: if ✓, then position 2 is N; if -, then N must be at 3? Because only 2 or 3 possible.

So we can narrow down.

But we also get feedback on U, K, Y.

Now, are there other words?

What about with N at 3 and H at 5? For example, ""PUNCH"" but C excluded? Not.

""LUNCH"" same.

""BUNCH"" same.

""JUMPS"" no H.

""DUMPY"" no H or N? Not.

""LUMPY"" same.

""BUMPH"" - B,U,M,P,H -> but what about N? We need N? ""BUMPH"" has no N? Not.

""NYMPH"" - N,Y,M,P,H -> N at 1, Y at 2, M at 3, P at 4, H at 5. But we are testing N at position 1? But we know N is not at position 1? From guess 2? So if we put N at 1, we will get '-'? Because it's in the word but not at 1? So we don't gain new information? And we are not testing position 3 for N? Which is what we want.

In ""NYMPH"": N at 1 (which we know is wrong, so we get '-'), Y at 2, M at 3, P at 4, H at 5.

But we are testing H at position 5? Which is a new position? And we are testing Y, M, P.

But we know N is not at 1? So we get '-' for N? And we don't learn about position 3? So it's not efficient.

We want to test N at position 3? So we need a word with N at 3.

For example, ""JUMPY"" no H? Not.

""DUMPY"" no H.

""BULKY"" no N.

""FUNKY"" no H.

""PUNKY"" - P,U,N,K,Y -> N at 3? P(1),U(2),N(3),K(4),Y(5). But no H? We must have H? So not.

Unless we can have H? But we are not.

Another idea: ""HUMAN"" not allowed.

""HYMEN"" not allowed.

""HYDRA"" not allowed.

I think ""HUNKY"" is the best we can do.

But let's check if there is a word with N at 3 and H at 1: ""HUMAN"" not allowed.

""HAVEN"" has A,E? Not.

""HUTCH"" not.

""HYMNS"" has S? Not.

""HEATH"" has E,A? Not.

So I think ""HUNKY"" is acceptable.

Therefore, we guess ""HUNKY"".

But note: in ""HUNKY"", we have U at position 3? And K at 4, Y at 5.

We are testing these.

Also, we are testing H at 1 and N at 2.

If we get:
- H at 1: if ✓, then H is at 1; if -, then H is not at 1? Then it must be at 3 or 5? But in the word, we have U at 3 and Y at 5? So if H is at 3, then U would be at 3? But H is at 3? Conflict? No, because positions are distinct? So if H is at 3, then in ""HUNKY"", the U at 3 would be a different letter? So if H is at 3, then U at 3 would be marked as x? Because it's not in the word? Or if the secret word has U? We don't know.

But we are testing U, so we get feedback on U.

Similarly, if H is at 5, then Y at 5 would be x? Or if Y is in the word? We don't know.

So it's okay.

Therefore, I choose ""HUNKY"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)  
  - **Excluded letters (not in word)**: C, R, A, E.  
  - **N is in the word** but not at position 4.  

- **Guess 2: night** → N(-), I(x), G(x), H(-), T(x)  
  - **Excluded letters (not in word)**: I, G, T (adding to previous exclusions).  
  - **N is in the word** but not at position 1.  
  - **H is in the word** but not at position 4.  

- **Guess 3: shown** → S(x), H(-), O(x), W(x), N(-)  
  - **Excluded letters (not in word)**: S, O, W (adding to previous exclusions).  
  - **H is in the word** but not at position 2.  
  - **N is in the word** but not at position 5.  

### Key Inferences:
- **Total excluded letters (13)**: C, R, A, E, I, G, T, S, O, W. These letters are **not in the secret word**.  
- **Confirmed letters in the word (2)**: N and H (both must appear exactly once, as no duplicate feedback was given).  
- **Position constraints for N**:  
  - Not at position 1 (from Guess 2).  
  - Not at position 4 (from Guess 1).  
  - Not at position 5 (from Guess 3).  
  - **Therefore, N must be at position 2 or 3**.  
- **Position constraints for H**:  
  - Not at position 4 (from Guess 2).  
  - Not at position 2 (from Guess 3).  
  - **Therefore, H must be at position 1, 3, or 5**.  
- **Remaining positions**: The secret word has 5 letters, so 3 additional letters (besides N and H) need to be discovered. These must come from the available letters: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.  
- **No duplicates**: Feedback indicates no repeated letters (all markings were for single instances).  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Must include N and H** to test their positions:  
  - N must be at position 2 or 3.  
  - H must be at position 1, 3, or 5 (but cannot share a position with N).  
- **Avoid all excluded letters** (C, R, A, E, I, G, T, S, O, W).  
- **Maximize information** by:  
  - Testing N at position 2 (since position 3 is the only alternative if this fails).  
  - Testing H at position 1 (since positions 3 and 5 are untested).  
  - Including new common letters from the available set (e.g., U, L, D, P, M) to increase coverage.  
- **Selected word: ""HUNKY""** (H, U, N, K, Y):  
  - **H at position 1**: Tests if H is at position 1 (if ✓, position 1 is solved; if -, H must be at 3 or 5).  
  - **N at position 3**: Tests if N is at position 3 (if ✓, position 3 is solved; if -, N must be at 2).  
  - **New letters tested**: U (position 2), K (position 4), Y (position 5).  
  - **All letters valid**: H, U, N, K, Y are not excluded.  
  - **Why not other words?**  
    - Words with N at position 2 and H at position 1 (e.g., ""HUNKY"") are rare.  
    - Alternatives like ""HUMAN"" (A excluded) or ""HOUND"" (O excluded, N at 4 invalid) are invalid.  
    - ""HUNKY"" is a valid English word (meaning strong or attractive).  

### Expected Feedback:
- If N is at position 3, it may show ✓ for N.  
- If H is at position 1, it may show ✓ for H.  
- Feedback on U, K, Y will help identify the remaining letters.  

<guess>hunky</guess>",hunky,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Meaning: C, R, A, E are not in the word. N is in the word but not at position 4.

Guess 2: ""night"" -> N(-) I(x) G(x) H(-) T(x)
Meaning: N is in the word but not at position 1. I, G, T are not in the word. H is in the word but not at position 4.

Guess 3: ""shown"" -> S(x) H(-) O(x) W(x) N(-)
Meaning: S, O, W are not in the word. H is in the word but not at position 2. N is in the word but not at position 5.

Now, combining all:

Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, A, E, I, G, T, S, O, W (from all three guesses). So excluded: C, R, A, E, I, G, T, S, O, W.

Confirmed letters in the word: N and H (from previous feedback, and they are still in because we got '-' for them in guess 3, meaning they are present but not at the guessed positions).

Position constraints for N:
- Not at position 1 (from guess 2: N at position 1 got '-')
- Not at position 4 (from guess 1: N at position 4 got '-')
- Not at position 5 (from guess 3: N at position 5 got '-')

Therefore, N must be at position 2 or 3 (since only positions 2 and 3 are left for a 5-letter word).

Position constraints for H:
- Not at position 4 (from guess 2: H at position 4 got '-')
- Not at position 2 (from guess 3: H at position 2 got '-')
- We don't have information about positions 1, 3, or 5 for H.

Therefore, H must be at position 1, 3, or 5.

But note: the word has 5 positions, and we have two letters: N and H. So there are three more letters to find.

Available letters: We have excluded 10 letters: C, R, A, E, I, G, T, S, O, W. So available: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word that:
- Contains N and H (both must be present).
- N is at position 2 or 3.
- H is at position 1, 3, or 5 (but note: if N is at 3, then H cannot be at 3? Because we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But in the feedback, we haven't seen duplicates, so we assume no duplicates? The feedback doesn't show duplicates? Actually, the feedback might show multiple of the same letter? But in this case, we have no indication of duplicates. So we assume each letter appears once? Therefore, N and H are distinct and in different positions.

So, if N is at position 2, then H can be at 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2, obviously).
If N is at position 3, then H can be at 1 or 5 (not 3, and not 2 because we know H not at 2).

Also, we have three other positions to fill with letters from the available set.

We need to choose a word that tests the possible positions for N and H and includes new letters.

Let's consider the possibilities:

Case 1: N at position 2.
Then the word: _ N _ _ _
H can be at 1, 3, or 5.

But if H at 1: H N _ _ _
If H at 3: _ N H _ _
If H at 5: _ N _ _ H

Case 2: N at position 3.
Then the word: _ _ N _ _
H can be at 1 or 5 (since not at 2,3,4).
If H at 1: H _ N _ _
If H at 5: _ _ N _ H

We need to find actual words that fit these patterns and use only available letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We should prioritize common letters to increase chances: like L, D, U, P, M, B, etc.

Let's try to find words:

First, with N at position 2:

- If H at 1: ""H N _ _ _""
  Words: ""HND??"" not common. ""HANDY"" but A excluded? Not. ""HONEY"" but O and E excluded? Not. ""HUNKY"" but U,K,Y -> but we have U,K,Y allowed? But ""HUNKY"": H,U,N,K,Y -> U at 3, K at 4, Y at 5. But N is at 2? H(1),N(2),U(3),K(4),Y(5). But we have to check if U,K,Y are allowed? Yes, they are not excluded. And no duplicates? So ""HUNKY"" is a word? Yes, meaning healthy and strong.

  But note: we have H at position 1? And we are testing it? We know H is in the word, but we don't know its position. So if we put H at 1, we might get a '✓' or '-'.

  Similarly, N at 2: we are testing position 2 for N? If it's correct, we get '✓'; if not, we get '-' and then N must be at 3? But we are testing N at 2? So if we get a '-' for N at 2, then N must be at 3? Because only two possibilities.

  So ""HUNKY"" seems a candidate.

- If H at 3: ""_ N H _ _""
  Words: ""UNHIP"" but U,N,H,I,P -> I excluded? Not. ""INHUM"" not a word. ""ANH??"" not. Hard to find.

- If H at 5: ""_ N _ _ H""
  Words: ""UNFIX"" but U,N,F,I,X -> I excluded? Not. ""UNZIP"" has Z,I -> I excluded? Not. ""UNMIX"" has I? Not. ""UNDUH"" not a word. Hard.

So ""HUNKY"" is a good candidate for N at 2 and H at 1.

Now, with N at position 3:

- If H at 1: ""H _ N _ _""
  Words: ""HIND?"" but I excluded? ""HAND"" has A? Not. ""HONE"" has O,E? Not. ""HUNK"" but 4 letters? We need 5. ""HUMAN"" has A? Not. ""HYMNS"" has Y,M,N,S -> but S excluded? S is excluded? From guess 3, S(x) so not in word? So cannot use S. ""HUMPS"" has U,M,P,S -> S excluded? Not. ""HUMUS"" has U,M,S -> S excluded? Not. ""HUTCH"" has U,T,C,H -> T and C excluded? Not. Hard.

  ""HUMAN"" not allowed.

  ""HYPNO"" but P,N,O -> O excluded? Not.

  ""HUBBY"" has U,B,B -> duplicates? But B twice? And Y. But ""HUBBY"" is a word? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But in feedback, we haven't seen duplicates? But we can try? But let's avoid for now.

  Actually, we can use duplicates? But the feedback would show if a letter is repeated? But in this case, we have no duplicate letters in the feedback so far? So we assume no duplicates? Or we can have? But to be safe, let's avoid duplicates.

  So ""H _ N _ _"" without duplicates and without excluded letters.

  ""HUMAN"" not allowed.

  ""HELIX"" has E,L,I,X -> E and I excluded? Not.

  ""HAVOC"" has A,V,O,C -> A,O,C excluded? Not.

  Hard to find.

- If H at 5: ""_ _ N _ H""
  Words: ""BUNCH"" but C excluded? Not. ""LUNCH"" same. ""DUNCH"" not common. ""FUNKY"" but F,U,N,K,Y -> but no H? We need H at 5? ""FUNKY"" has no H? So not.

  ""PUNCH"" has P,U,N,C,H -> C excluded? Not.

  ""MUNCH"" has M,U,N,C,H -> C excluded? Not.

  ""BUNCH"" same.

  ""LINEN"" has L,I,N,E,N -> I and E excluded? And duplicate N? Not.

  ""MINIM"" has I,M -> I excluded? Not.

  Hard.

So the only viable word I found is ""HUNKY"" for the case N at 2 and H at 1.

But let's confirm: ""HUNKY"" - H at 1, U at 2? No: H at 1, N at 2, U at 3, K at 4, Y at 5.

But we are testing N at position 2? And H at position 1.

Also, U, K, Y are new letters.

Now, if we get feedback:
- If H at 1 is correct, we get ✓ for H.
- If not, we get - for H? But we know H is in the word? So if not at 1, then it must be at 3 or 5? But in this word, we don't have H at other positions? So we get - for H at 1, meaning H is not at 1? Then we know H must be at 3 or 5? But we are not testing those? So we would need another guess.

Similarly for N at 2: if ✓, then position 2 is N; if -, then N must be at 3? Because only 2 or 3 possible.

So we can narrow down.

But we also get feedback on U, K, Y.

Now, are there other words?

What about with N at 3 and H at 5? For example, ""PUNCH"" but C excluded? Not.

""LUNCH"" same.

""BUNCH"" same.

""JUMPS"" no H.

""DUMPY"" no H or N? Not.

""LUMPY"" same.

""BUMPH"" - B,U,M,P,H -> but what about N? We need N? ""BUMPH"" has no N? Not.

""NYMPH"" - N,Y,M,P,H -> N at 1, Y at 2, M at 3, P at 4, H at 5. But we are testing N at position 1? But we know N is not at position 1? From guess 2? So if we put N at 1, we will get '-'? Because it's in the word but not at 1? So we don't gain new information? And we are not testing position 3 for N? Which is what we want.

In ""NYMPH"": N at 1 (which we know is wrong, so we get '-'), Y at 2, M at 3, P at 4, H at 5.

But we are testing H at position 5? Which is a new position? And we are testing Y, M, P.

But we know N is not at 1? So we get '-' for N? And we don't learn about position 3? So it's not efficient.

We want to test N at position 3? So we need a word with N at 3.

For example, ""JUMPY"" no H? Not.

""DUMPY"" no H.

""BULKY"" no N.

""FUNKY"" no H.

""PUNKY"" - P,U,N,K,Y -> N at 3? P(1),U(2),N(3),K(4),Y(5). But no H? We must have H? So not.

Unless we can have H? But we are not.

Another idea: ""HUMAN"" not allowed.

""HYMEN"" not allowed.

""HYDRA"" not allowed.

I think ""HUNKY"" is the best we can do.

But let's check if there is a word with N at 3 and H at 1: ""HUMAN"" not allowed.

""HAVEN"" has A,E? Not.

""HUTCH"" not.

""HYMNS"" has S? Not.

""HEATH"" has E,A? Not.

So I think ""HUNKY"" is acceptable.

Therefore, we guess ""HUNKY"".

But note: in ""HUNKY"", we have U at position 3? And K at 4, Y at 5.

We are testing these.

Also, we are testing H at 1 and N at 2.

If we get:
- H at 1: if ✓, then H is at 1; if -, then H is not at 1? Then it must be at 3 or 5? But in the word, we have U at 3 and Y at 5? So if H is at 3, then U would be at 3? But H is at 3? Conflict? No, because positions are distinct? So if H is at 3, then in ""HUNKY"", the U at 3 would be a different letter? So if H is at 3, then U at 3 would be marked as x? Because it's not in the word? Or if the secret word has U? We don't know.

But we are testing U, so we get feedback on U.

Similarly, if H is at 5, then Y at 5 would be x? Or if Y is in the word? We don't know.

So it's okay.

Therefore, I choose ""HUNKY"".
