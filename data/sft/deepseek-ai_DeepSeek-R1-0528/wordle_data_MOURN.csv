We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
 - All letters are distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We have the first guess: ""crane"" with feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(x)
 Interpretation:
 - C, A, E are not in the secret word at all.
 - R and N are in the word but in the wrong positions.

 Therefore, the secret word contains R and N, but not C, A, or E.

 Since R is in the word but not in position 2 (because our guess had R at position 2 and it was marked wrong), and similarly N is in the word but not in position 4.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 Now, for our next guess, we want to:
 1. Include R and N (since they are in the word).
 2. Avoid using C, A, E (because they are not in the word).
 3. Try to place R and N in different positions to check their correct spots.

 Also, we can consider other common letters. Since we have only used 5 letters, we should try other vowels or common consonants.

 The vowels we haven't tried yet: I, O, U. We know A and E are out. So maybe we can try a word with I or O.

 Since R is in the word, and it was misplaced at position 2, let's try putting R in a different position (like position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5). Similarly for N.

 But note: we have two letters that must be included: R and N.

 We also have to avoid C, A, E.

 Let's brainstorm words that include R and N and use other vowels.

 We also want to use new letters to get more information.

 Since we only have two known letters (R and N), we need to cover more of the alphabet.

 Alternative common consonants: T, S, L, etc.

 One idea: Try a word starting with T? Or S? Since we have excluded C.

 Possible words: ""TRUNK"", ""BORNS"", but need valid words.

 However, note that the feedback does not tell us the number of occurrences. So if we use a letter twice, we might get confused. Therefore, we should try words with distinct letters when possible.

 Let's try to use R and N and three new letters.

 Possible vowels: O and I. We can also try U but it's less common.

 Example words that have R and N and avoid C, A, E:

 - ""HORNS"": H, O, R, N, S -> but we haven't tried H, O, S. However, note that we must place R and N in positions different from the first guess? Not necessarily, because the word might have multiple positions, but we don't know duplicates. So let's avoid duplicate letters for now.

 Since the first guess had R at position 2 and it was wrong, and N at position 4 and it was wrong, we can try R at position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5, and N at a different position.

 But note: the secret word must have R and N. Let's try putting R at position 1 and N at position 3? Or R at position 4?

 Also, we don't know how many letters are known so far? Only two.

 We need three more.

 Another common starting word after excluding A, E: we can use I and O.

 How about ""PRINT""? 
 - P is new, R we know, I is new, N we know, T is new?
 But wait, R is at position 2 again? Because ""PRINT"" has P (1), R (2), I (3), N (4), T (5). 
 However, in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong, so if we put R again at position 2, it might still be wrong? But if the word has two R's? We don't know.

 Alternatively, move R to a different position? For example, place R at position 3?

 We can choose a word that has R at position 1? And N at position 4? Or N at position 5?

 Example words:

 - ""ROUND"": R, O, U, N, D -> but U is not very common. Also, we have O and U as new vowels. But avoids C,A,E. However, we tried A and E and they are out. This word places R at 1 and N at 4.

 - ""HORNS"": R at 3 and N at 4? No: H(1),O(2),R(3),N(4),S(5). We haven't tried positions 1, 3, 5 for R and N. In the first guess, R was at 2 and N at 4.

 Alternatively, we might consider ""BORNS"" but that's not a word. How about ""BORNE""? But E is out.

 Another word: ""IRONY"" - I(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5). But that's five letters and avoids A,E,C? But R is at 2 again. However, we can try it? But R at 2 was already tested and marked as wrong? It might be that the word has R at 2? Not necessarily because if the word has two R's? We don't have information about duplicate letters.

 However, note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was marked with '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 2. Therefore, R cannot be at position 2. So if we choose a word with R at position 2, we will definitely get a '-' again? Or if the word has another R? But we don't know.

 Since we want to maximize information, let's avoid putting R in the same position again (position 2) and avoid position 2 for N? Well, for N: we had it at position 4 and it was marked wrong. So we should try N in a new position.

 Rule: for a known letter, try it in a position we haven't tried before.

 So, for R: we have only tried position 2, so we can try positions 1, 3, 4, 5.
 For N: we have only tried position 4, so we can try 1, 2, 3, 5.

 Therefore, let's try a word that has R in a position we haven't tried and N in a position we haven't tried.

 Also, use letters we haven't tried to get more information.

 We've tried: C, R, A, N, E -> so avoid these? Actually, avoid C, A, E and use other letters.

 Then, the available letters are: 
 Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we know the word has R and N)
 Vowels: I, O, U (A and E are out)

 Now, we want to cover common letters. Maybe try S and T? They are very common.

 Suggested word: ""STORM""
 But ""STORM"" has S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), M(5). 
 - Here, R is at position 4 (a new position) and N? We don't have N. But we know N must be in the word! So we cannot omit N.

 So we need a word that includes both R and N.

 How about ""STERN""? 
 - S, T, E, R, N -> but E is out! We can't use E.

 We must avoid E. So ""STERN"" is bad.

 How about ""STRON""? Not a word.

 ""STORN""? Not a word.

 ""TRINS""? Not a word.

 Another word: ""PRION""? Not common.

 Let me suggest:
 ""GROIN"" : G(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), N(5)
 But R is at position 2 again? We should avoid that? However, if the word has two R's, we might get feedback on the second occurrence? But we don't have to avoid it entirely? It's okay to put R at 2 again? We don't know the duplicates? But the feedback might tell us.

 Alternatively, let me think of a word with R at a position other than 2 and N at a position other than 4.

 Example: ""BRING"" -> B(1), R(2) ... again R at 2. We want to move R.

 Also, ""BRING"" has E? No: B,R,I,N,G. But wait, no E? And avoids C,A,E? But R is at 2 again.

 Words with R not at 2:
 - ""DRINK"": D(1), R(2) ... same issue.
 - ""FROWN"": F(1), R(2) ... again.

 Let me try to put R at position 1? 
 - ""ROUND"": R,O,U,N,D -> R at 1, N at 4? We tried N at 4 already? Yes, in ""crane"", N was at 4 and mispositioned. So we can try N at a different position? In ""ROUND"", N is at position 4? That's the same? So it would be marked as '-'? And we wouldn't learn a new position for N.

 Alternatively, ""RINSE"": R,I,N,S,E -> but E is out. Not allowed.

 ""RANKS"": has A? A is out.

 ""RONIN"": not a word? Actually, it's a word (historical term), but let's avoid.

 How about ""GROWN"": G(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). 
 - R at 2? We have position 2 for R already tested? But we can try? But N at position 5? We haven't tried N at 5.

 This word: G, R, O, W, N -> avoids C,A,E and includes R and N.

 We can learn: 
 - Positions: R at 2? If it's not the correct position (which we know from previous it isn't) then it will be '-'. And N at position 5: if it is correct, we get ✓, or '-' otherwise.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R at a completely new position? Let's look for words with R at 3 or 4.

 Words with R at 3: ""TRIBE"" -> T,R,I,B,E -> E not allowed? ""TRICK"" -> no A,E but has C? C is also out? We cannot use C.

 How about ""PRINT"" again? But R is at 2? No: in ""PRINT"", R is at position 2? 

 How about: ""SPURN"": S(1), P(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). 
 That's good: R at position 4 and N at position 5? Both positions are new (we had R at 2 and N at 4 only). Also, uses S,P,U which are new. Avoids C,A,E.

 So ""SPURN"": 
 - Pos1: S, we don't know -> if in word and correct? etc.
 - Pos2: P? 
 - Pos3: U?
 - Pos4: R? We are trying R at position 4.
 - Pos5: N? We are trying N at position 5.

 This seems like a decent guess.

 Let's consider: The secret word must have R and N, so we are covering that. We are also introducing S, P, U.

 How about another option? ""SHRUN"": not a word.

 ""SPURN"" is valid? Yes, it means to reject or something.

 So let's try ""SPURN"".

 But we can also think of other words.

 Another word: ""BORNS"" is not valid. How about ""HORNS""? 
 ""HORNS"": H(1),O(2),R(3),N(4),S(5) -> 
 - R at position 3 (we haven't tried) and N at position 4? We have tried N at position 4? In ""crane"", N was at position 4? So we already know N is at position 4? And it's wrong? So we get a '-' again? And we don't learn a new position? 
 - Therefore, we cannot rule out if N is at position 4? Actually, the previous guess told us that N is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, in ""HORNS"", if we put N at position 4, we will definitely get a '-'? Because it's in the word but at wrong position? But doesn't matter? We still get the information that N isn't at position 4? We already know? So it will be marked '-'.

 So it's okay? Actually, we can try N at position 4 again? It will still be '-'. But it won't provide new information about N? So it's more efficient to try a word that has N in a new position? So that we can see if we get a ✓? And if not, then we know it's in the remaining positions.

 Therefore, we prefer to move N to a new position? But positions for N are 1,2,3,5 left? 

 So in ""HORNS"": N is at 4 which we already know is wrong? So it will be '-'? That gives us no new information? And then we can't tell about the new position? 

 So I think ""SPURN"" is better? Because it moves both R and N to new positions.

 Alternatively, ""RUNTS"": R(1),U(2),N(3),T(4),S(5) -> 
 This uses: R at 1 (new), U, N at 3 (new), T, S? And avoids C,A,E.

 Yes, ""RUNTS"" is a word? (meaning: undersized animals)

 So ""RUNTS"": 
 - R at position 1, which we haven't tested? Can be ✓ or whatever? 
 - U at 2?
 - N at position 3 (new) vs position 4 we know?
 - Then T and S.

 So this also seems good? But note: we have only one vowel? U? But vowels are important? Or is U acceptable? We don't know.

 We need to pick one.

 Choose between ""SPURN"" and ""RUNTS"". Both cover new positions for R and N? 
 In ""RUNTS"": R at 1, N at 3? And in the first guess, R was at position 2, and N at position 4? So both positions are new? 

 How about ""PRONG"": P(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), G(5)? 
 But R is at 2? And we already know position 2 is wrong? So we hope that if R is at 2? But the feedback already said R isn't at 2? So it is likely to be '-'? Unless there is a duplicate? And N at position 4? We know it's wrong too? 

 So we don't want to do that? 

 Alternatively, ""SPRING"" is 6 letters? Wait, we need 5.

 We have to pick a 5-letter word.

 Consider: ""TRUNK"": T(1), R(2), U(2), N(4), K(5). 
 - R at 2 is already known wrong? And N at 4 is known wrong? So we would get '-' for both? And we introduce T,U,K? But we don't learn new positions.

 So less efficient? 

 Another word: ""BIRTH""? No N.

 We must have R and N.

 Conclusion: I think ""SPURN"" or ""RUNTS"" are good?

 Let me go with ""RUNTS"". It has R at position 1 and N at position 3? And uses T and S which are very common? And U is the only vowel? It might be informative.

 Therefore, my next guess: ""RUNTS"".

 But let me check if ""RUNTS"" is valid? Yes.

 So <guess> runts </guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, A, and E are **not in the word**.  
- R and N **are in the word but in the wrong positions** (R was position 2, N was position 4).  

For the next guess:  
- Must include R and N (since they are confirmed present).  
- Avoid C, A, E (since they are absent).  
- Place R and N in **new positions** to test their correct locations (e.g., avoid R at position 2 and N at position 4).  
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information, prioritizing unused consonants like S and T.  

The word **""RUNTS""** fits these criteria:  
- R is placed at position 1 (new, untested position).  
- N is placed at position 3 (new position, compared to the previous position 4).  
- Includes fresh letters: U (vowel), T (common consonant), and S (common consonant).  
- Avoids forbidden letters C, A, E.

 But R is at position 2 again? We should avoid that? However, if the word has two R's, we might get feedback on the second occurrence? But we don't have to avoid it entirely? It's okay to put R at 2 again? We don't know the duplicates? But the feedback might tell us.

 Alternatively, let me think of a word with R at a position other than 2 and N at a position other than 4.

 Example: ""BRING"" -> B(1), R(2) ... again R at 2. We want to move R.

 Also, ""BRING"" has E? No: B,R,I,N,G. But wait, no E? And avoids C,A,E? But R is at 2 again.

 Words with R not at 2:
 - ""DRINK"": D(1), R(2) ... same issue.
 - ""FROWN"": F(1), R(2) ... again.

 Let me try to put R at position 1? 
 - ""ROUND"": R,O,U,N,D -> R at 1, N at 4? We tried N at 4 already? Yes, in ""crane"", N was at 4 and mispositioned. So we can try N at a different position? In ""ROUND"", N is at position 4? That's the same? So it would be marked as '-'? And we wouldn't learn a new position for N.

 Alternatively, ""RINSE"": R,I,N,S,E -> but E is out. Not allowed.

 ""RANKS"": has A? A is out.

 ""RONIN"": not a word? Actually, it's a word (historical term), but let's avoid.

 How about ""GROWN"": G(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). 
 - R at 2? We have position 2 for R already tested? But we can try? But N at position 5? We haven't tried N at 5.

 This word: G, R, O, W, N -> avoids C,A,E and includes R and N.

 We can learn: 
 - Positions: R at 2? If it's not the correct position (which we know from previous it isn't) then it will be '-'. And N at position 5: if it is correct, we get ✓, or '-' otherwise.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R at a completely new position? Let's look for words with R at 3 or 4.

 Words with R at 3: ""TRIBE"" -> T,R,I,B,E -> E not allowed? ""TRICK"" -> no A,E but has C? C is also out? We cannot use C.

 How about ""PRINT"" again? But R is at 2? No: in ""PRINT"", R is at position 2? 

 How about: ""SPURN"": S(1), P(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). 
 That's good: R at position 4 and N at position 5? Both positions are new (we had R at 2 and N at 4 only). Also, uses S,P,U which are new. Avoids C,A,E.

 So ""SPURN"": 
 - Pos1: S, we don't know -> if in word and correct? etc.
 - Pos2: P? 
 - Pos3: U?
 - Pos4: R? We are trying R at position 4.
 - Pos5: N? We are trying N at position 5.

 This seems like a decent guess.

 Let's consider: The secret word must have R and N, so we are covering that. We are also introducing S, P, U.

 How about another option? ""SHRUN"": not a word.

 ""SPURN"" is valid? Yes, it means to reject or something.

 So let's try ""SPURN"".

 But we can also think of other words.

 Another word: ""BORNS"" is not valid. How about ""HORNS""? 
 ""HORNS"": H(1),O(2),R(3),N(4),S(5) -> 
 - R at position 3 (we haven't tried) and N at position 4? We have tried N at position 4? In ""crane"", N was at position 4? So we already know N is at position 4? And it's wrong? So we get a '-' again? And we don't learn a new position? 
 - Therefore, we cannot rule out if N is at position 4? Actually, the previous guess told us that N is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, in ""HORNS"", if we put N at position 4, we will definitely get a '-'? Because it's in the word but at wrong position? But doesn't matter? We still get the information that N isn't at position 4? We already know? So it will be marked '-'.

 So it's okay? Actually, we can try N at position 4 again? It will still be '-'. But it won't provide new information about N? So it's more efficient to try a word that has N in a new position? So that we can see if we get a ✓? And if not, then we know it's in the remaining positions.

 Therefore, we prefer to move N to a new position? But positions for N are 1,2,3,5 left? 

 So in ""HORNS"": N is at 4 which we already know is wrong? So it will be '-'? That gives us no new information? And then we can't tell about the new position? 

 So I think ""SPURN"" is better? Because it moves both R and N to new positions.

 Alternatively, ""RUNTS"": R(1),U(2),N(3),T(4),S(5) -> 
 This uses: R at 1 (new), U, N at 3 (new), T, S? And avoids C,A,E.

 Yes, ""RUNTS"" is a word? (meaning: undersized animals)

 So ""RUNTS"": 
 - R at position 1, which we haven't tested? Can be ✓ or whatever? 
 - U at 2?
 - N at position 3 (new) vs position 4 we know?
 - Then T and S.

 So this also seems good? But note: we have only one vowel? U? But vowels are important? Or is U acceptable? We don't know.

 We need to pick one.

 Choose between ""SPURN"" and ""RUNTS"". Both cover new positions for R and N? 
 In ""RUNTS"": R at 1, N at 3? And in the first guess, R was at position 2, and N at position 4? So both positions are new? 

 How about ""PRONG"": P(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), G(5)? 
 But R is at 2? And we already know position 2 is wrong? So we hope that if R is at 2? But the feedback already said R isn't at 2? So it is likely to be '-'? Unless there is a duplicate? And N at position 4? We know it's wrong too? 

 So we don't want to do that? 

 Alternatively, ""SPRING"" is 6 letters? Wait, we need 5.

 We have to pick a 5-letter word.

 Consider: ""TRUNK"": T(1), R(2), U(2), N(4), K(5). 
 - R at 2 is already known wrong? And N at 4 is known wrong? So we would get '-' for both? And we introduce T,U,K? But we don't learn new positions.

 So less efficient? 

 Another word: ""BIRTH""? No N.

 We must have R and N.

 Conclusion: I think ""SPURN"" or ""RUNTS"" are good?

 Let me go with ""RUNTS"". It has R at position 1 and N at position 3? And uses T and S which are very common? And U is the only vowel? It might be informative.

 Therefore, my next guess: ""RUNTS"".

 But let me check if ""RUNTS"" is valid? Yes.

 So <guess> runts </guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, A, and E are **not in the word**.  
- R and N **are in the word but in the wrong positions** (R was position 2, N was position 4).  

For the next guess:  
- Must include R and N (since they are confirmed present).  
- Avoid C, A, E (since they are absent).  
- Place R and N in **new positions** to test their correct locations (e.g., avoid R at position 2 and N at position 4).  
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information, prioritizing unused consonants like S and T.  

The word **""RUNTS""** fits these criteria:  
- R is placed at position 1 (new, untested position).  
- N is placed at position 3 (new position, compared to the previous position 4).  
- Includes fresh letters: U (vowel), T (common consonant), and S (common consonant).

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
 - All letters are distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the first guess: ""crane"" with feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(x)
 Interpretation:
 - C, A, E are not in the secret word at all.
 - R and N are in the word but in the wrong positions.

 Therefore, the secret word contains R and N, but not C, A, or E.

 Since R is in the word but not in position 2 (because our guess had R at position 2 and it was marked wrong), and similarly N is in the word but not in position 4.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 Now, for our next guess, we want to:
 1. Include R and N (since they are in the word).
 2. Avoid using C, A, E (because they are not in the word).
 3. Try to place R and N in different positions to check their correct spots.

 Also, we can consider other common letters. Since we have only used 5 letters, we should try other vowels or common consonants.

 The vowels we haven't tried yet: I, O, U. We know A and E are out. So maybe we can try a word with I or O.

 Since R is in the word, and it was misplaced at position 2, let's try putting R in a different position (like position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5). Similarly for N.

 But note: we have two letters that must be included: R and N.

 We also have to avoid C, A, E.

 Let's brainstorm words that include R and N and use other vowels.

 We also want to use new letters to get more information.

 Since we only have two known letters (R and N), we need to cover more of the alphabet.

 Alternative common consonants: T, S, L, etc.

 One idea: Try a word starting with T? Or S? Since we have excluded C.

 Possible words: ""TRUNK"", ""BORNS"", but need valid words.

 However, note that the feedback does not tell us the number of occurrences. So if we use a letter twice, we might get confused. Therefore, we should try words with distinct letters when possible.

 Let's try to use R and N and three new letters.

 Possible vowels: O and I. We can also try U but it's less common.

 Example words that have R and N and avoid C, A, E:

 - ""HORNS"": H, O, R, N, S -> but we haven't tried H, O, S. However, note that we must place R and N in positions different from the first guess? Not necessarily, because the word might have multiple positions, but we don't know duplicates. So let's avoid duplicate letters for now.

 Since the first guess had R at position 2 and it was wrong, and N at position 4 and it was wrong, we can try R at position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5, and N at a different position.

 But note: the secret word must have R and N. Let's try putting R at position 1 and N at position 3? Or R at position 4?

 Also, we don't know how many letters are known so far? Only two.

 We need three more.

 Another common starting word after excluding A, E: we can use I and O.

 How about ""PRINT""? 
 - P is new, R we know, I is new, N we know, T is new?
 But wait, R is at position 2 again? Because ""PRINT"" has P (1), R (2), I (3), N (4), T (5). 
 However, in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong, so if we put R again at position 2, it might still be wrong? But if the word has two R's? We don't know.

 Alternatively, move R to a different position? For example, place R at position 3?

 We can choose a word that has R at position 1? And N at position 4? Or N at position 5?

 Example words:

 - ""ROUND"": R, O, U, N, D -> but U is not very common. Also, we have O and U as new vowels. But avoids C,A,E. However, we tried A and E and they are out. This word places R at 1 and N at 4.

 - ""HORNS"": R at 3 and N at 4? No: H(1),O(2),R(3),N(4),S(5). We haven't tried positions 1, 3, 5 for R and N. In the first guess, R was at 2 and N at 4.

 Alternatively, we might consider ""BORNS"" but that's not a word. How about ""BORNE""? But E is out.

 Another word: ""IRONY"" - I(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5). But that's five letters and avoids A,E,C? But R is at 2 again. However, we can try it? But R at 2 was already tested and marked as wrong? It might be that the word has R at 2? Not necessarily because if the word has two R's? We don't have information about duplicate letters.

 However, note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was marked with '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 2. Therefore, R cannot be at position 2. So if we choose a word with R at position 2, we will definitely get a '-' again? Or if the word has another R? But we don't know.

 Since we want to maximize information, let's avoid putting R in the same position again (position 2) and avoid position 2 for N? Well, for N: we had it at position 4 and it was marked wrong. So we should try N in a new position.

 Rule: for a known letter, try it in a position we haven't tried before.

 So, for R: we have only tried position 2, so we can try positions 1, 3, 4, 5.
 For N: we have only tried position 4, so we can try 1, 2, 3, 5.

 Therefore, let's try a word that has R in a position we haven't tried and N in a position we haven't tried.

 Also, use letters we haven't tried to get more information.

 We've tried: C, R, A, N, E -> so avoid these? Actually, avoid C, A, E and use other letters.

 Then, the available letters are: 
 Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we know the word has R and N)
 Vowels: I, O, U (A and E are out)

 Now, we want to cover common letters. Maybe try S and T? They are very common.

 Suggested word: ""STORM""
 But ""STORM"" has S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), M(5). 
 - Here, R is at position 4 (a new position) and N? We don't have N. But we know N must be in the word! So we cannot omit N.

 So we need a word that includes both R and N.

 How about ""STERN""? 
 - S, T, E, R, N -> but E is out! We can't use E.

 We must avoid E. So ""STERN"" is bad.

 How about ""STRON""? Not a word.

 ""STORN""? Not a word.

 ""TRINS""? Not a word.

 Another word: ""PRION""? Not common.

 Let me suggest:
 ""GROIN"" : G(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), N(5)
 But R is at position 2 again? We should avoid that? However, if the word has two R's, we might get feedback on the second occurrence? But we don't have to avoid it entirely? It's okay to put R at 2 again? We don't know the duplicates? But the feedback might tell us.

 Alternatively, let me think of a word with R at a position other than 2 and N at a position other than 4.

 Example: ""BRING"" -> B(1), R(2) ... again R at 2. We want to move R.

 Also, ""BRING"" has E? No: B,R,I,N,G. But wait, no E? And avoids C,A,E? But R is at 2 again.

 Words with R not at 2:
 - ""DRINK"": D(1), R(2) ... same issue.
 - ""FROWN"": F(1), R(2) ... again.

 Let me try to put R at position 1? 
 - ""ROUND"": R,O,U,N,D -> R at 1, N at 4? We tried N at 4 already? Yes, in ""crane"", N was at 4 and mispositioned. So we can try N at a different position? In ""ROUND"", N is at position 4? That's the same? So it would be marked as '-'? And we wouldn't learn a new position for N.

 Alternatively, ""RINSE"": R,I,N,S,E -> but E is out. Not allowed.

 ""RANKS"": has A? A is out.

 ""RONIN"": not a word? Actually, it's a word (historical term), but let's avoid.

 How about ""GROWN"": G(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). 
 - R at 2? We have position 2 for R already tested? But we can try? But N at position 5? We haven't tried N at 5.

 This word: G, R, O, W, N -> avoids C,A,E and includes R and N.

 We can learn: 
 - Positions: R at 2? If it's not the correct position (which we know from previous it isn't) then it will be '-'. And N at position 5: if it is correct, we get ✓, or '-' otherwise.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R at a completely new position? Let's look for words with R at 3 or 4.

 Words with R at 3: ""TRIBE"" -> T,R,I,B,E -> E not allowed? ""TRICK"" -> no A,E but has C? C is also out? We cannot use C.

 How about ""PRINT"" again? But R is at 2? No: in ""PRINT"", R is at position 2? 

 How about: ""SPURN"": S(1), P(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). 
 That's good: R at position 4 and N at position 5? Both positions are new (we had R at 2 and N at 4 only). Also, uses S,P,U which are new. Avoids C,A,E.

 So ""SPURN"": 
 - Pos1: S, we don't know -> if in word and correct? etc.
 - Pos2: P? 
 - Pos3: U?
 - Pos4: R? We are trying R at position 4.
 - Pos5: N? We are trying N at position 5.

 This seems like a decent guess.

 Let's consider: The secret word must have R and N, so we are covering that. We are also introducing S, P, U.

 How about another option? ""SHRUN"": not a word.

 ""SPURN"" is valid? Yes, it means to reject or something.

 So let's try ""SPURN"".

 But we can also think of other words.

 Another word: ""BORNS"" is not valid. How about ""HORNS""? 
 ""HORNS"": H(1),O(2),R(3),N(4),S(5) -> 
 - R at position 3 (we haven't tried) and N at position 4? We have tried N at position 4? In ""crane"", N was at position 4? So we already know N is at position 4? And it's wrong? So we get a '-' again? And we don't learn a new position? 
 - Therefore, we cannot rule out if N is at position 4? Actually, the previous guess told us that N is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, in ""HORNS"", if we put N at position 4, we will definitely get a '-'? Because it's in the word but at wrong position? But doesn't matter? We still get the information that N isn't at position 4? We already know? So it will be marked '-'.

 So it's okay? Actually, we can try N at position 4 again? It will still be '-'. But it won't provide new information about N? So it's more efficient to try a word that has N in a new position? So that we can see if we get a ✓? And if not, then we know it's in the remaining positions.

 Therefore, we prefer to move N to a new position? But positions for N are 1,2,3,5 left? 

 So in ""HORNS"": N is at 4 which we already know is wrong? So it will be '-'? That gives us no new information? And then we can't tell about the new position? 

 So I think ""SPURN"" is better? Because it moves both R and N to new positions.

 Alternatively, ""RUNTS"": R(1),U(2),N(3),T(4),S(5) -> 
 This uses: R at 1 (new), U, N at 3 (new), T, S? And avoids C,A,E.

 Yes, ""RUNTS"" is a word? (meaning: undersized animals)

 So ""RUNTS"": 
 - R at position 1, which we haven't tested? Can be ✓ or whatever? 
 - U at 2?
 - N at position 3 (new) vs position 4 we know?
 - Then T and S.

 So this also seems good? But note: we have only one vowel? U? But vowels are important? Or is U acceptable? We don't know.

 We need to pick one.

 Choose between ""SPURN"" and ""RUNTS"". Both cover new positions for R and N? 
 In ""RUNTS"": R at 1, N at 3? And in the first guess, R was at position 2, and N at position 4? So both positions are new? 

 How about ""PRONG"": P(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), G(5)? 
 But R is at 2? And we already know position 2 is wrong? So we hope that if R is at 2? But the feedback already said R isn't at 2? So it is likely to be '-'? Unless there is a duplicate? And N at position 4? We know it's wrong too? 

 So we don't want to do that? 

 Alternatively, ""SPRING"" is 6 letters? Wait, we need 5.

 We have to pick a 5-letter word.

 Consider: ""TRUNK"": T(1), R(2), U(2), N(4), K(5). 
 - R at 2 is already known wrong? And N at 4 is known wrong? So we would get '-' for both? And we introduce T,U,K? But we don't learn new positions.

 So less efficient? 

 Another word: ""BIRTH""? No N.

 We must have R and N.

 Conclusion: I think ""SPURN"" or ""RUNTS"" are good?

 Let me go with ""RUNTS"". It has R at position 1 and N at position 3? And uses T and S which are very common? And U is the only vowel? It might be informative.

 Therefore, my next guess: ""RUNTS"".

 But let me check if ""RUNTS"" is valid? Yes.

 So <guess> runts </guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":

We can also try U but it\'s less common.\n\n Example words that have R and N and avoid C, A, E:\n\n - ""HORNS"": H, O, R, N, S -> but we haven\'t tried H, O, S. However, note that we must place R and N in positions different from the first guess? Not necessarily, because the word might have multiple positions, but we don\'t know duplicates. So let\'s avoid duplicate letters for now.\n\n Since the first guess had R at position 2 and it was wrong, and N at position 4 and it was wrong, we can try R at position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5, and N at a different position.\n\n But note: the secret word must have R and N. Let\'s try putting R at position 1 and N at position 3? Or R at position 4?\n\n Also, we don\'t know how many letters are known so far? Only two.\n\n We need three more.\n\n Another common starting word after excluding A, E: we can use I and O.\n\n How about ""PRINT""? \n - P is new, R we know, I is new, N we know, T is new?\n But wait, R is at position 2 again? Because ""PRINT"" has P (1), R (2), I (3), N (4), T (5). \n However, in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong, so if we put R again at position 2, it might still be wrong? But if the word has two R\'s? We don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, move R to a different position? For example, place R at position 3?\n\n We can choose a word that has R at position 1? And N at position 4? Or N at position 5?\n\n Example words:\n\n - ""ROUND"": R, O, U, N, D -> but U is not very common. Also, we have O and U as new vowels. But avoids C,A,E. However, we tried A and E and they are out. This word places R at 1 and N at 4.\n\n - ""HORNS"": R at 3 and N at 4? No: H(1),O(2),R(3),N(4),S(5). We haven\'t tried positions 1, 3, 5 for R and N. In the first guess, R was at 2 and N at 4.\n\n Alternatively, we might consider ""BORNS"" but that\'s not a word. How about ""BORNE""? But E is out.\n\n Another word: ""IRONY"" - I(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5). But that\'s five letters and avoids A,E,C? But R is at 2 again. However, we can try it? But R at 2 was already tested and marked as wrong? It might be that the word has R at 2? Not necessarily because if the word has two R\'s? We don\'t have information about duplicate letters.\n\n However, note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was marked with \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 2. Therefore, R cannot be at position 2. So if we choose a word with R at position 2, we will definitely get a \'-\' again? Or if the word has another R? But we don\'t know.\n\n Since we want to maximize information, let\'s avoid putting R in the same position again (position 2) and avoid position 2 for N? Well, for N: we had it at position 4 and it was marked wrong. So we should try N in a new position.\n\n Rule: for a known letter, try it in a position we haven\'t tried before.\n\n So, for R: we have only tried position 2, so we can try positions 1, 3, 4, 5.\n For N: we have only tried position 4, so we can try 1, 2, 3, 5.\n\n Therefore, let\'s try a word that has R in a position we haven\'t tried and N in a position we haven\'t tried.\n\n Also, use letters we haven\'t tried to get more information.\n\n We\'ve tried: C, R, A, N, E -> so avoid these? Actually, avoid C, A, E and use other letters.\n\n Then, the available letters are: \n Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we know the word has R and N)\n Vowels: I, O, U (A and E are out)\n\n Now, we want to cover common letters. Maybe try S and T? They are very common.\n\n Suggested word: ""STORM""\n But ""STORM"" has S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), M(5). \n - Here, R is at position 4 (a new position) and N? We don\'t have N. But we know N must be in the word! So we cannot omit N.\n\n So we need a word that includes both R and N.\n\n How about ""STERN""? \n - S, T, E, R, N -> but E is out! We can\'t use E.\n\n We must avoid E. So ""STERN"" is bad.\n\n How about ""STRON""? Not a word.\n\n ""STORN""? Not a word.\n\n ""TRINS""? Not a word.\n\n Another word: ""PRION""? Not common.\n\n Let me suggest:\n ""GROIN"" : G(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), N(5)\n But R is at position 2 again? We should avoid that? However, if the word has two R\'s, we might get feedback on the second occurrence? But we don\'t have to avoid it entirely? It\'s okay to put R at 2 again? We don\'t know the duplicates? But the feedback might tell us.\n\n Alternatively, let me think of a word with R at a position other than 2 and N at a position other than 4.\n\n Example: ""BRING"" -> B(1), R(2) ... again R at 2. We want to move R.\n\n Also, ""BRING"" has E? No: B,R,I,N,G. But wait, no E? And avoids C,A,E? But R is at 2 again.\n\n Words with R not at 2:\n - ""DRINK"": D(1), R(2) ... same issue.\n - ""FROWN"": F(1), R(2) ... again.\n\n Let me try to put R at position 1? \n - ""ROUND"": R,O,U,N,D -> R at 1, N at 4? We tried N at 4 already? Yes, in ""crane"", N was at 4 and mispositioned. So we can try N at a different position? In ""ROUND"", N is at position 4? That\'s the same? So it would be marked as \'-\'? And we wouldn\'t learn a new position for N.\n\n Alternatively, ""RINSE"": R,I,N,S,E -> but E is out. Not allowed.\n\n ""RANKS"": has A? A is out.\n\n ""RONIN"": not a word? Actually, it\'s a word (historical term), but let\'s avoid.\n\n How about ""GROWN"": G(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). \n - R at 2? We have position 2 for R already tested? But we can try? But N at position 5? We haven\'t tried N at 5.\n\n This word: G, R, O, W, N -> avoids C,A,E and includes R and N.\n\n We can learn: \n - Positions: R at 2? If it\'s not the correct position (which we know from previous it isn\'t) then it will be \'-\'. And N at position 5: if it is correct, we get ✓, or \'-\' otherwise.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put R at a completely new position? Let\'s look for words with R at 3 or 4.\n\n Words with R at 3: ""TRIBE"" -> T,R,I,B,E -> E not allowed? ""TRICK"" -> no A,E but has C? C is also out? We cannot use C.\n\n How about ""PRINT"" again? But R is at 2? No: in ""PRINT"", R is at position 2? \n\n How about: ""SPURN"": S(1), P(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). \n That\'s good: R at position 4 and N at position 5? Both positions are new (we had R at 2 and N at 4 only). Also, uses S,P,U which are new. Avoids C,A,E.\n\n So ""SPURN"": \n - Pos1: S, we don\'t know -> if in word and correct? etc.\n - Pos2: P? \n - Pos3: U?\n - Pos4: R? We are trying R at position 4.\n - Pos5: N? We are trying N at position 5.\n\n This seems like a decent guess.\n\n Let\'s consider: The secret word must have R and N, so we are covering that. We are also introducing S, P, U.\n\n How about another option? ""SHRUN"": not a word.\n\n ""SPURN"" is valid? Yes, it means to reject or something.\n\n So let\'s try ""SPURN"".\n\n But we can also think of other words.\n\n Another word: ""BORNS"" is not valid. How about ""HORNS""? \n ""HORNS"": H(1),O(2),R(3),N(4),S(5) -> \n - R at position 3 (we haven\'t tried) and N at position 4? We have tried N at position 4? In ""crane"", N was at position 4? So we already know N is at position 4? And it\'s wrong? So we get a \'-\' again? And we don\'t learn a new position? \n - Therefore, we cannot rule out if N is at position 4? Actually, the previous guess told us that N is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, in ""HORNS"", if we put N at position 4, we will definitely get a \'-\'? Because it\'s in the word but at wrong position? But doesn\'t matter? We still get the information that N isn\'t at position 4? We already know? So it will be marked \'-\'.\n\n So it\'s okay? Actually, we can try N at position 4 again? It will still be \'-\'. But it won\'t provide new information about N? So it\'s more efficient to try a word that has N in a new position? So that we can see if we get a ✓? And if not, then we know it\'s in the remaining positions.\n\n Therefore, we prefer to move N to a new position? But positions for N are 1,2,3,5 left? \n\n So in ""HORNS"": N is at 4 which we already know is wrong? So it will be \'-\'? That gives us no new information? And then we can\'t tell about the new position? \n\n So I think ""SPURN"" is better? Because it moves both R and N to new positions.\n\n Alternatively, ""RUNTS"": R(1),U(2),N(3),T(4),S(5) -> \n This uses: R at 1 (new), U, N at 3 (new), T, S? And avoids C,A,E.\n\n Yes, ""RUNTS"" is a word? (meaning: undersized animals)\n\n So ""RUNTS"": \n - R at position 1, which we haven\'t tested? Can be ✓ or whatever? \n - U at 2?\n - N at position 3 (new) vs position 4 we know?\n - Then T and S.\n\n So this also seems good? But note: we have only one vowel? U? But vowels are important? Or is U acceptable? We don\'t know.\n\n We need to pick one.\n\n Choose between ""SPURN"" and ""RUNTS"". Both cover new positions for R and N? \n In ""RUNTS"": R at 1, N at 3? And in the first guess, R was at position 2, and N at position 4? So both positions are new? \n\n How about ""PRONG"": P(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), G(5)? \n But R is at 2? And we already know position 2 is wrong? So we hope that if R is at 2? But the feedback already said R isn\'t at 2? So it is likely to be \'-\'? Unless there is a duplicate? And N at position 4? We know it\'s wrong too? \n\n So we don\'t want to do that? \n\n Alternatively, ""SPRING"" is 6 letters? Wait, we need 5.\n\n We have to pick a 5-letter word.\n\n Consider: ""TRUNK"": T(1), R(2), U(2), N(4), K(5). \n - R at 2 is already known wrong? And N at 4 is known wrong? So we would get \'-\' for both? And we introduce T,U,K? But we don\'t learn new positions.\n\n So less efficient? \n\n Another word: ""BIRTH""? No N.\n\n We must have R and N.\n\n Conclusion: I think ""SPURN"" or ""RUNTS"" are good?\n\n Let me go with ""RUNTS"". It has R at position 1 and N at position 3? And uses T and S which are very common? And U is the only vowel? It might be informative.\n\n Therefore, my next guess: ""RUNTS"".\n\n But let me check if ""RUNTS"" is valid? Yes.\n\n So <guess> runts </guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- C, A, and E are **not in the word**.  \n- R and N **are in the word but in the wrong positions** (R was position 2, N was position 4).  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n- Must include R and N (since they are confirmed present).  \n- Avoid C, A, E (since they are absent).  \n- Place R and N in **new positions** to test their correct locations (e.g., avoid R at position 2 and N at position 4).  \n- Introduce new common letters to gather more information, prioritizing unused consonants like S and T.  \n\nThe word **""RUNTS""** fits these criteria:  \n- R is placed at position 1 (new, untested position).  \n- N is placed at position 3 (new position, compared to the previous position 4).  \n- Includes fresh letters: U (vowel), T (common consonant), and S (common consonant).  \n- Avoids forbidden letters C, A, E.\n\n<guess>runts</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: runts -> FEEDBACK: R(-) U(-) N(-) T(x) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
After the second guess ""runts"", the feedback is: R(-), U(-), N(-), T(x), S(x)

Breaking this down:
- R is in the word but not at position 1 (our guess had R at position 1, marked wrong position).
- U is in the word but not at position 2 (guessed at 2, marked wrong position).
- N is in the word but not at position 3 (guessed at 3, marked wrong position).
- T is not in the word at all (x).
- S is not in the word at all (x).

We also recall from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, E are not in the word.
- R was at position 2 (wrong position), now at position 1 also wrong position.
- N was at position 4 (wrong position), now at position 3 also wrong position.

So, the secret word:
- Contains: R, U, N (confirmed present by both guesses).
- Does NOT contain: C, A, E, T, S (all marked x).
- Letters tried so far: C, R, A, N, E (from first guess) and R, U, N, T, S (from second). So combined used letters: C, A, R, E, N, U, T, S.

Discarded letters: C, A, E, T, S
Confirmed present but misplaced: R, U, N

Constraints:
- R cannot be at pos 1 or 2.
- N cannot be at pos 3 or 4.
- U cannot be at pos 2.
- We also have only 5 positions to fill.

Since R is in the word and not at 1 or 2, possible positions: 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly for N: not at 3 or 4, so possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.
Similarly for U: not at 2, so possible: 1, 3, 4, 5.

But note: there might be duplicate letters? However, we don't have evidence of duplicates, so we'll assume distinct for now until feedback forces otherwise.

The secret word must consist of R, U, N, and two other letters we haven't tried yet, excluding the discarded ones.

Discarded: C,A,E,T,S — so available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z, and vowels: I,O remain unused.

We have three known letters: R, U, N. We need a 5-letter word, so two more unknown letters to discover.

Our next guess should:
- Include all three known letters (R,U,N) to pin down their positions.
- Avoid discarded letters: C,A,E,T,S.
- Use new letters to cover more ground.
- Place R, U, and N in positions we haven't tested yet.

Given the position constraints:
- R must be in position 3,4, or5 (since not1 or2)
- N must be in position 1,2, or5 (since not3 or4)
- U must not be in position2, so positions:1,3,4,5.

Now, we need to form a valid English word with these constraints.

Consider possible positions for each:
- Position 1: Could be N or U? Or a new letter? (not R position1 is ruled out)
- Position 2: Could be N? Or a new letter? (not R or U? Wait U cannot be at2 but others can)
- Etc.

We should test a word that puts R, U, N in different positions.

Also, we want words that incorporate common unused letters to get info? For example, O, I (vowels), or B, D, etc.

List possible words:

First, note that N can only be at 1,2,5? But if we put N at position1, and U at position1? Conflict? Positions are unique per letter.

Think of words with R,U,N and two other letters.

Possible words:

- Start with N? If N at position1: e.g., ""N_U_R"" but with U and R in middle?

For example, ""NURSE""? But S is out? Not allowed? S discarded.

""NURDS""? S discarded? ""NURDS"" is not a valid word. ""NURDS"" might be slang. Avoid if possible? Or ""NORTH""? Has T? T discarded? ""NOMAD""? Has A? A discarded.

Try incorporating vowels I or O? We haven't used them.

Example: ""ORCIN""? Invalid.

How about ""ROUND"": R at1, O at2, U at3, N at4, D at5? 
Problem: 
- In first guess, N at4 was misplaced? So if we put N at4? We know it's wrong? We haven't tested position5 for N? 
But wait: ""ROUND"" has R at1? We tried R at1 in second guess and it was marked wrong? So R at1 is wrong? So ""ROUND"" would have R at position1? Which we know is wrong? So that's a '-' again? 

But also: first guess had N at4? Wrong position? Second guess didn't test position4? But we believe N should not be at4? So in ""ROUND"", N at4 would be marked '-'? 

Moreover, ""ROUND"" doesn't include U? Wait, U is at position3? But in second guess, U was at position2? And we didn't test U at position3? 

But the letters: R,O,U,N,D? Avoids discarded letters? Discarded are C,A,E,T,S? So O and D are new? R,U,N are known? So it's possible? 

However, R at position1: In guess2 (""runts""), position1 was R? And we got '-', so R not at1? So we shouldn't put R at1? Because we already know it's not correct? 

Similarly, U: at position3? We only tested U at position2? So we don't know about position3? 

N: at position4? But in guess1 (""crane""), N was at position4? And we got '-'? So we know N is not at4? Therefore, putting N at position4 again would be a '-'? And no new info? 

Therefore, ""ROUND"" is inefficient because: 
- R at1: we already know R not at1? 
- N at4: already know N not at4? 
So both moves are wasted? 

Instead, we should form words that place:
- R in position 3,4, or5? And we haven't tested any of these? 
- Similarly, N at position 1,2, or5? 
- We haven't tested N at position1? Or position2? Or position5? 

Possible words with N at position1 or2? And R at 3,4,5? 

How about ""MINOR""? M,I,N,O,R? 
But note: we don't know if the word has M or I or O? But that's okay? 
But also: positions: 
Pos1: M? 
Pos2: I? 
Pos3: N? But wait, N at3? In guess2 (""runts""), we placed N at position3? And feedback was '-'? Meaning N is in word but not at3? So we shouldn't put N at3? 

Therefore: N cannot be at3? We must avoid position3 for N? 

Similarly: 
Possible positions for N? Only positions not tested? Meaning: since in guess1: position4? In guess2: position3? So left positions: 1,2,5? 

Similarly for R? Tested at position1? And position2? So left positions: 3,4,5? 

For U? Tested only at position2? So we can test at positions 1,3,4,5? 

Now, words: 

Option: Place N at position1? Then U at position3? R at position5? Etc? 
Structure: N _ U ? R? but R must be at5? 

Possible words: 
""NUBR_""? Not filling up easily? 

Also: since we have two unknown letters? 

Common letters left: O, I, D, L, M, H, etc. 

Another idea: ""FLUNG""? F,L,U,N,G? 
Positions: F(1),L(2),U(3),N(4),G(5)? 
But N at4? We know N is not at4? From first guess? And U at3? We haven't tested? 

Problem: L and F new? 
But: 
- U at3? 
- N at4? Which we know will be '-'? 
But we have no R? Wait, R is missing? But R must be in the word? 

We cannot omit R? 

The word must include R? 

So need R present? 

Therefore: a valid word must have R,U,N and two other letters? 

Another try: ""PRION""? But P,R,I,O,N? 
Positions: P(1),R(2),I(3),O(4),N(5)? 
Now: 
- R at2? In first guess (""crane""), R at2 was marked '-'? So we know R is not at2? Therefore, putting R at2 will result in '-'? 
- N at5? We haven't tested? 
- But we are putting R at2 which is known to be wrong? So wasted? 
We are trying to place R in a new position? Here at2 repeated? 

Better: ""PRION"" but R at2? Bad? 

How about ""UNRIG""? U(1),N(2),R(3),I(4),G(5)? 
Letters: U,N,R,I,G. Avoids discarded? 
Positions: 
Pos1: U? 
Pos2: N? We haven't tested N at2? 
Pos3: R? We haven't tested R at3? 
Pos4: I? 
Pos5: G? 

So: 
- U at position1: not tested? 
- N at position2: not tested? 
- R at position3: not tested? 
All new positions? 

Perfect? 

Also, avoids all discarded letters? 

So let's go with ""UNRIG"". 

Is ""UNRIG"" a valid word? Yes, meaning to unrig or dismantle? 

Therefore: UNRIG as next guess? 

Alternative: ""GUIRN"" — not common? 
""UNDID""? Has D, but U at1, N at2, D at4? No R? 
We need R? 

So ""UNRIG"" seems good? 

But wait: U was tested at pos2? In ""RUNTS"" we had U at2? Marked as '-'? So we cannot put U at2? But in UNRIG? U is at1? Which we haven't tested? 
Similarly, N is at2? Which we haven't tested? 

Yes? 

Therefore: guess ""UNRIG"". 

So: <guess>unrig</guess>

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

**Guess 1: crane**
- Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
- **Key insights**:
  - C, A, E: Not in the word.
  - R: In the word, but not at position 2.
  - N: In the word, but not at position 4.

**Guess 2: runts**
- Feedback: R(-) U(-) N(-) T(x) S(x)
- **Key insights**:
  - R: Still in the word, but not at position 1 (new info).
  - U: In the word, but not at position 2 (new info).
  - N: Still in the word, but not at position 3 (new info).
  - T, S: Not in the word.

### Summary of Constraints:
- **Confirmed present letters**: R, U, N.
- **Absent letters**: C, A, E, T, S.
- **Position constraints**:
  - R cannot be at position 1 or 2 → Must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
  - U cannot be at position 2 → Must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
  - N cannot be at position 3 or 4 → Must be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
- **Letters tested so far**: C, R, A, N, E, U, T, S.
- **Untested letters**: Many remain (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

### Next Guess Requirements:
- Must include R, U, and N to resolve their positions.
- Avoid discarded letters: C, A, E, T, S.
- Prioritize placing R, U, N in **untested positions**:
  - R: Test positions 3, 4, or 5 (positions 1 and 2 ruled out).
  - U: Test positions other than 2 (positions 1, 3, 4, 5 available).
  - N: Test positions 1, 2, or 5 (positions 3 and 4 ruled out).
- Introduce new high-frequency letters (e.g., O, I, L, D) to maximize information.

### Selected Guess: ""UNRIG""
- **Breakdown**:
  - U at position 1: Untested for U (previously tested at position 2).
  - N at position 2: Untested for N (previously tested at positions 3 and 4).
  - R at position 3: Untested for R (previously tested at positions 1 and 2).
  - Introduces new letters: I (position 4) and G (position 5).
- **Why ""UNRIG""?** 
  - 100% satisfies position constraints for R, U, N.
  - Valid English word (verb: to dismantle rigging).
  - Avoids discarded letters.
  - Maximizes new information by testing R/U/N in fresh positions and adding I/G.

**Final Guess**:  
<guess>unrig</guess>",unrig,"After the second guess ""runts"", the feedback is: R(-), U(-), N(-), T(x), S(x)

Breaking this down:
- R is in the word but not at position 1 (our guess had R at position 1, marked wrong position).
- U is in the word but not at position 2 (guessed at 2, marked wrong position).
- N is in the word but not at position 3 (guessed at 3, marked wrong position).
- T is not in the word at all (x).
- S is not in the word at all (x).

We also recall from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, E are not in the word.
- R was at position 2 (wrong position), now at position 1 also wrong position.
- N was at position 4 (wrong position), now at position 3 also wrong position.

So, the secret word:
- Contains: R, U, N (confirmed present by both guesses).
- Does NOT contain: C, A, E, T, S (all marked x).
- Letters tried so far: C, R, A, N, E (from first guess) and R, U, N, T, S (from second). So combined used letters: C, A, R, E, N, U, T, S.

Discarded letters: C, A, E, T, S
Confirmed present but misplaced: R, U, N

Constraints:
- R cannot be at pos 1 or 2.
- N cannot be at pos 3 or 4.
- U cannot be at pos 2.
- We also have only 5 positions to fill.

Since R is in the word and not at 1 or 2, possible positions: 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly for N: not at 3 or 4, so possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.
Similarly for U: not at 2, so possible: 1, 3, 4, 5.

But note: there might be duplicate letters? However, we don't have evidence of duplicates, so we'll assume distinct for now until feedback forces otherwise.

The secret word must consist of R, U, N, and two other letters we haven't tried yet, excluding the discarded ones.

Discarded: C,A,E,T,S — so available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z, and vowels: I,O remain unused.

We have three known letters: R, U, N. We need a 5-letter word, so two more unknown letters to discover.

Our next guess should:
- Include all three known letters (R,U,N) to pin down their positions.
- Avoid discarded letters: C,A,E,T,S.
- Use new letters to cover more ground.
- Place R, U, and N in positions we haven't tested yet.

Given the position constraints:
- R must be in position 3,4, or5 (since not1 or2)
- N must be in position 1,2, or5 (since not3 or4)
- U must not be in position2, so positions:1,3,4,5.

Now, we need to form a valid English word with these constraints.

Consider possible positions for each:
- Position 1: Could be N or U? Or a new letter? (not R position1 is ruled out)
- Position 2: Could be N? Or a new letter? (not R or U? Wait U cannot be at2 but others can)
- Etc.

We should test a word that puts R, U, N in different positions.

Also, we want words that incorporate common unused letters to get info? For example, O, I (vowels), or B, D, etc.

List possible words:

First, note that N can only be at 1,2,5? But if we put N at position1, and U at position1? Conflict? Positions are unique per letter.

Think of words with R,U,N and two other letters.

Possible words:

- Start with N? If N at position1: e.g., ""N_U_R"" but with U and R in middle?

For example, ""NURSE""? But S is out? Not allowed? S discarded.

""NURDS""? S discarded? ""NURDS"" is not a valid word. ""NURDS"" might be slang. Avoid if possible? Or ""NORTH""? Has T? T discarded? ""NOMAD""? Has A? A discarded.

Try incorporating vowels I or O? We haven't used them.

Example: ""ORCIN""? Invalid.

How about ""ROUND"": R at1, O at2, U at3, N at4, D at5? 
Problem: 
- In first guess, N at4 was misplaced? So if we put N at4? We know it's wrong? We haven't tested position5 for N? 
But wait: ""ROUND"" has R at1? We tried R at1 in second guess and it was marked wrong? So R at1 is wrong? So ""ROUND"" would have R at position1? Which we know is wrong? So that's a '-' again? 

But also: first guess had N at4? Wrong position? Second guess didn't test position4? But we believe N should not be at4? So in ""ROUND"", N at4 would be marked '-'? 

Moreover, ""ROUND"" doesn't include U? Wait, U is at position3? But in second guess, U was at position2? And we didn't test U at position3? 

But the letters: R,O,U,N,D? Avoids discarded letters? Discarded are C,A,E,T,S? So O and D are new? R,U,N are known? So it's possible? 

However, R at position1: In guess2 (""runts""), position1 was R? And we got '-', so R not at1? So we shouldn't put R at1? Because we already know it's not correct? 

Similarly, U: at position3? We only tested U at position2? So we don't know about position3? 

N: at position4? But in guess1 (""crane""), N was at position4? And we got '-'? So we know N is not at4? Therefore, putting N at position4 again would be a '-'? And no new info? 

Therefore, ""ROUND"" is inefficient because: 
- R at1: we already know R not at1? 
- N at4: already know N not at4? 
So both moves are wasted? 

Instead, we should form words that place:
- R in position 3,4, or5? And we haven't tested any of these? 
- Similarly, N at position 1,2, or5? 
- We haven't tested N at position1? Or position2? Or position5? 

Possible words with N at position1 or2? And R at 3,4,5? 

How about ""MINOR""? M,I,N,O,R? 
But note: we don't know if the word has M or I or O? But that's okay? 
But also: positions: 
Pos1: M? 
Pos2: I? 
Pos3: N? But wait, N at3? In guess2 (""runts""), we placed N at position3? And feedback was '-'? Meaning N is in word but not at3? So we shouldn't put N at3? 

Therefore: N cannot be at3? We must avoid position3 for N? 

Similarly: 
Possible positions for N? Only positions not tested? Meaning: since in guess1: position4? In guess2: position3? So left positions: 1,2,5? 

Similarly for R? Tested at position1? And position2? So left positions: 3,4,5? 

For U? Tested only at position2? So we can test at positions 1,3,4,5? 

Now, words: 

Option: Place N at position1? Then U at position3? R at position5? Etc? 
Structure: N _ U ? R? but R must be at5? 

Possible words: 
""NUBR_""? Not filling up easily? 

Also: since we have two unknown letters? 

Common letters left: O, I, D, L, M, H, etc. 

Another idea: ""FLUNG""? F,L,U,N,G? 
Positions: F(1),L(2),U(3),N(4),G(5)? 
But N at4? We know N is not at4? From first guess? And U at3? We haven't tested? 

Problem: L and F new? 
But: 
- U at3? 
- N at4? Which we know will be '-'? 
But we have no R? Wait, R is missing? But R must be in the word? 

We cannot omit R? 

The word must include R? 

So need R present? 

Therefore: a valid word must have R,U,N and two other letters? 

Another try: ""PRION""? But P,R,I,O,N? 
Positions: P(1),R(2),I(3),O(4),N(5)? 
Now: 
- R at2? In first guess (""crane""), R at2 was marked '-'? So we know R is not at2? Therefore, putting R at2 will result in '-'? 
- N at5? We haven't tested? 
- But we are putting R at2 which is known to be wrong? So wasted? 
We are trying to place R in a new position? Here at2 repeated? 

Better: ""PRION"" but R at2? Bad? 

How about ""UNRIG""? U(1),N(2),R(3),I(4),G(5)? 
Letters: U,N,R,I,G. Avoids discarded? 
Positions: 
Pos1: U? 
Pos2: N? We haven't tested N at2? 
Pos3: R? We haven't tested R at3? 
Pos4: I? 
Pos5: G? 

So: 
- U at position1: not tested? 
- N at position2: not tested? 
- R at position3: not tested? 
All new positions? 

Perfect? 

Also, avoids all discarded letters? 

So let's go with ""UNRIG"". 

Is ""UNRIG"" a valid word? Yes, meaning to unrig or dismantle? 

Therefore: UNRIG as next guess? 

Alternative: ""GUIRN"" — not common? 
""UNDID""? Has D, but U at1, N at2, D at4? No R? 
We need R? 

So ""UNRIG"" seems good? 

But wait: U was tested at pos2? In ""RUNTS"" we had U at2? Marked as '-'? So we cannot put U at2? But in UNRIG? U is at1? Which we haven't tested? 
Similarly, N is at2? Which we haven't tested? 

Yes? 

Therefore: guess ""UNRIG"". 

So: <guess>unrig</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
 - All letters are distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the first guess: ""crane"" with feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(x)
 Interpretation:
 - C, A, E are not in the secret word at all.
 - R and N are in the word but in the wrong positions.

 Therefore, the secret word contains R and N, but not C, A, or E.

 Since R is in the word but not in position 2 (because our guess had R at position 2 and it was marked wrong), and similarly N is in the word but not in position 4.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 Now, for our next guess, we want to:
 1. Include R and N (since they are in the word).
 2. Avoid using C, A, E (because they are not in the word).
 3. Try to place R and N in different positions to check their correct spots.

 Also, we can consider other common letters. Since we have only used 5 letters, we should try other vowels or common consonants.

 The vowels we haven't tried yet: I, O, U. We know A and E are out. So maybe we can try a word with I or O.

 Since R is in the word, and it was misplaced at position 2, let's try putting R in a different position (like position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5). Similarly for N.

 But note: we have two letters that must be included: R and N.

 We also have to avoid C, A, E.

 Let's brainstorm words that include R and N and use other vowels.

 We also want to use new letters to get more information.

 Since we only have two known letters (R and N), we need to cover more of the alphabet.

 Alternative common consonants: T, S, L, etc.

 One idea: Try a word starting with T? Or S? Since we have excluded C.

 Possible words: ""TRUNK"", ""BORNS"", but need valid words.

 However, note that the feedback does not tell us the number of occurrences. So if we use a letter twice, we might get confused. Therefore, we should try words with distinct letters when possible.

 Let's try to use R and N and three new letters.

 Possible vowels: O and I. We can also try U but it's less common.

 Example words that have R and N and avoid C, A, E:

 - ""HORNS"": H, O, R, N, S -> but we haven't tried H, O, S. However, note that we must place R and N in positions different from the first guess? Not necessarily, because the word might have multiple positions, but we don't know duplicates. So let's avoid duplicate letters for now.

 Since the first guess had R at position 2 and it was wrong, and N at position 4 and it was wrong, we can try R at position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5, and N at a different position.

 But note: the secret word must have R and N. Let's try putting R at position 1 and N at position 3? Or R at position 4?

 Also, we don't know how many letters are known so far? Only two.

 We need three more.

 Another common starting word after excluding A, E: we can use I and O.

 How about ""PRINT""? 
 - P is new, R we know, I is new, N we know, T is new?
 But wait, R is at position 2 again? Because ""PRINT"" has P (1), R (2), I (3), N (4), T (5). 
 However, in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong, so if we put R again at position 2, it might still be wrong? But if the word has two R's? We don't know.

 Alternatively, move R to a different position? For example, place R at position 3?

 We can choose a word that has R at position 1? And N at position 4? Or N at position 5?

 Example words:

 - ""ROUND"": R, O, U, N, D -> but U is not very common. Also, we have O and U as new vowels. But avoids C,A,E. However, we tried A and E and they are out. This word places R at 1 and N at 4.

 - ""HORNS"": R at 3 and N at 4? No: H(1),O(2),R(3),N(4),S(5). We haven't tried positions 1, 3, 5 for R and N. In the first guess, R was at 2 and N at 4.

 Alternatively, we might consider ""BORNS"" but that's not a word. How about ""BORNE""? But E is out.

 Another word: ""IRONY"" - I(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5). But that's five letters and avoids A,E,C? But R is at 2 again. However, we can try it? But R at 2 was already tested and marked as wrong? It might be that the word has R at 2? Not necessarily because if the word has two R's? We don't have information about duplicate letters.

 However, note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was marked with '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 2. Therefore, R cannot be at position 2. So if we choose a word with R at position 2, we will definitely get a '-' again? Or if the word has another R? But we don't know.

 Since we want to maximize information, let's avoid putting R in the same position again (position 2) and avoid position 2 for N? Well, for N: we had it at position 4 and it was marked wrong. So we should try N in a new position.

 Rule: for a known letter, try it in a position we haven't tried before.

 So, for R: we have only tried position 2, so we can try positions 1, 3, 4, 5.
 For N: we have only tried position 4, so we can try 1, 2, 3, 5.

 Therefore, let's try a word that has R in a position we haven't tried and N in a position we haven't tried.

 Also, use letters we haven't tried to get more information.

 We've tried: C, R, A, N, E -> so avoid these? Actually, avoid C, A, E and use other letters.

 Then, the available letters are: 
 Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we know the word has R and N)
 Vowels: I, O, U (A and E are out)

 Now, we want to cover common letters. Maybe try S and T? They are very common.

 Suggested word: ""STORM""
 But ""STORM"" has S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), M(5). 
 - Here, R is at position 4 (a new position) and N? We don't have N. But we know N must be in the word! So we cannot omit N.

 So we need a word that includes both R and N.

 How about ""STERN""? 
 - S, T, E, R, N -> but E is out! We can't use E.

 We must avoid E. So ""STERN"" is bad.

 How about ""STRON""? Not a word.

 ""STORN""? Not a word.

 ""TRINS""? Not a word.

 Another word: ""PRION""? Not common.

 Let me suggest:
 ""GROIN"" : G(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), N(5)
 But R is at position 2 again? We should avoid that? However, if the word has two R's, we might get feedback on the second occurrence? But we don't have to avoid it entirely? It's okay to put R at 2 again? We don't know the duplicates? But the feedback might tell us.

 Alternatively, let me think of a word with R at a position other than 2 and N at a position other than 4.

 Example: ""BRING"" -> B(1), R(2) ... again R at 2. We want to move R.

 Also, ""BRING"" has E? No: B,R,I,N,G. But wait, no E? And avoids C,A,E? But R is at 2 again.

 Words with R not at 2:
 - ""DRINK"": D(1), R(2) ... same issue.
 - ""FROWN"": F(1), R(2) ... again.

 Let me try to put R at position 1? 
 - ""ROUND"": R,O,U,N,D -> R at 1, N at 4? We tried N at 4 already? Yes, in ""crane"", N was at 4 and mispositioned. So we can try N at a different position? In ""ROUND"", N is at position 4? That's the same? So it would be marked as '-'? And we wouldn't learn a new position for N.

 Alternatively, ""RINSE"": R,I,N,S,E -> but E is out. Not allowed.

 ""RANKS"": has A? A is out.

 ""RONIN"": not a word? Actually, it's a word (historical term), but let's avoid.

 How about ""GROWN"": G(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). 
 - R at 2? We have position 2 for R already tested? But we can try? But N at position 5? We haven't tried N at 5.

 This word: G, R, O, W, N -> avoids C,A,E and includes R and N.

 We can learn: 
 - Positions: R at 2? If it's not the correct position (which we know from previous it isn't) then it will be '-'. And N at position 5: if it is correct, we get ✓, or '-' otherwise.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R at a completely new position? Let's look for words with R at 3 or 4.

 Words with R at 3: ""TRIBE"" -> T,R,I,B,E -> E not allowed? ""TRICK"" -> no A,E but has C? C is also out? We cannot use C.

 How about ""PRINT"" again? But R is at 2? No: in ""PRINT"", R is at position 2? 

 How about: ""SPURN"": S(1), P(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). 
 That's good: R at position 4 and N at position 5? Both positions are new (we had R at 2 and N at 4 only). Also, uses S,P,U which are new. Avoids C,A,E.

 So ""SPURN"": 
 - Pos1: S, we don't know -> if in word and correct? etc.
 - Pos2: P? 
 - Pos3: U?
 - Pos4: R? We are trying R at position 4.
 - Pos5: N? We are trying N at position 5.

 This seems like a decent guess.

 Let's consider: The secret word must have R and N, so we are covering that. We are also introducing S, P, U.

 How about another option? ""SHRUN"": not a word.

 ""SPURN"" is valid? Yes, it means to reject or something.

 So let's try ""SPURN"".

 But we can also think of other words.

 Another word: ""BORNS"" is not valid. How about ""HORNS""? 
 ""HORNS"": H(1),O(2),R(3),N(4),S(5) -> 
 - R at position 3 (we haven't tried) and N at position 4? We have tried N at position 4? In ""crane"", N was at position 4? So we already know N is at position 4? And it's wrong? So we get a '-' again? And we don't learn a new position? 
 - Therefore, we cannot rule out if N is at position 4? Actually, the previous guess told us that N is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, in ""HORNS"", if we put N at position 4, we will definitely get a '-'? Because it's in the word but at wrong position? But doesn't matter? We still get the information that N isn't at position 4? We already know? So it will be marked '-'.

 So it's okay? Actually, we can try N at position 4 again? It will still be '-'. But it won't provide new information about N? So it's more efficient to try a word that has N in a new position? So that we can see if we get a ✓? And if not, then we know it's in the remaining positions.

 Therefore, we prefer to move N to a new position? But positions for N are 1,2,3,5 left? 

 So in ""HORNS"": N is at 4 which we already know is wrong? So it will be '-'? That gives us no new information? And then we can't tell about the new position? 

 So I think ""SPURN"" is better? Because it moves both R and N to new positions.

 Alternatively, ""RUNTS"": R(1),U(2),N(3),T(4),S(5) -> 
 This uses: R at 1 (new), U, N at 3 (new), T, S? And avoids C,A,E.

 Yes, ""RUNTS"" is a word? (meaning: undersized animals)

 So ""RUNTS"": 
 - R at position 1, which we haven't tested? Can be ✓ or whatever? 
 - U at 2?
 - N at position 3 (new) vs position 4 we know?
 - Then T and S.

 So this also seems good? But note: we have only one vowel? U? But vowels are important? Or is U acceptable? We don't know.

 We need to pick one.

 Choose between ""SPURN"" and ""RUNTS"". Both cover new positions for R and N? 
 In ""RUNTS"": R at 1, N at 3? And in the first guess, R was at position 2, and N at position 4? So both positions are new? 

 How about ""PRONG"": P(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), G(5)? 
 But R is at 2? And we already know position 2 is wrong? So we hope that if R is at 2? But the feedback already said R isn't at 2? So it is likely to be '-'? Unless there is a duplicate? And N at position 4? We know it's wrong too? 

 So we don't want to do that? 

 Alternatively, ""SPRING"" is 6 letters? Wait, we need 5.

 We have to pick a 5-letter word.

 Consider: ""TRUNK"": T(1), R(2), U(2), N(4), K(5). 
 - R at 2 is already known wrong? And N at 4 is known wrong? So we would get '-' for both? And we introduce T,U,K? But we don't learn new positions.

 So less efficient? 

 Another word: ""BIRTH""? No N.

 We must have R and N.

 Conclusion: I think ""SPURN"" or ""RUNTS"" are good?

 Let me go with ""RUNTS"". It has R at position 1 and N at position 3? And uses T and S which are very common? And U is the only vowel? It might be informative.

 Therefore, my next guess: ""RUNTS"".

 But let me check if ""RUNTS"" is valid? Yes.

 So <guess> runts </guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, A, and E are **not in the word**.  
- R and N **are in the word but in the wrong positions** (R was position 2, N was position 4).  

For the next guess:  
- Must include R and N (since they are confirmed present).  
- Avoid C, A, E (since they are absent).  
- Place R and N in **new positions** to test their correct locations (e.g., avoid R at position 2 and N at position 4).  
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information, prioritizing unused consonants like S and T.  

The word **""RUNTS""** fits these criteria:  
- R is placed at position 1 (new, untested position).  
- N is placed at position 3 (new position, compared to the previous position 4).  
- Includes fresh letters: U (vowel), T (common consonant), and S (common consonant).  
- Avoids forbidden letters C, A, E.

<guess>runts</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: runts -> FEEDBACK: R(-) U(-) N(-) T(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>After the second guess ""runts"", the feedback is: R(-), U(-), N(-), T(x), S(x)

Breaking this down:
- R is in the word but not at position 1 (our guess had R at position 1, marked wrong position).
- U is in the word but not at position 2 (guessed at 2, marked wrong position).
- N is in the word but not at position 3 (guessed at 3, marked wrong position).
- T is not in the word at all (x).
- S is not in the word at all (x).

We also recall from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, E are not in the word.
- R was at position 2 (wrong position), now at position 1 also wrong position.
- N was at position 4 (wrong position), now at position 3 also wrong position.

So, the secret word:
- Contains: R, U, N (confirmed present by both guesses).
- Does NOT contain: C, A, E, T, S (all marked x).
- Letters tried so far: C, R, A, N, E (from first guess) and R, U, N, T, S (from second). So combined used letters: C, A, R, E, N, U, T, S.

Discarded letters: C, A, E, T, S
Confirmed present but misplaced: R, U, N

Constraints:
- R cannot be at pos 1 or 2.
- N cannot be at pos 3 or 4.
- U cannot be at pos 2.
- We also have only 5 positions to fill.

Since R is in the word and not at 1 or 2, possible positions: 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly for N: not at 3 or 4, so possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.
Similarly for U: not at 2, so possible: 1, 3, 4, 5.

But note: there might be duplicate letters? However, we don't have evidence of duplicates, so we'll assume distinct for now until feedback forces otherwise.

The secret word must consist of R, U, N, and two other letters we haven't tried yet, excluding the discarded ones.

Discarded: C,A,E,T,S — so available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z, and vowels: I,O remain unused.

We have three known letters: R, U, N. We need a 5-letter word, so two more unknown letters to discover.

Our next guess should:
- Include all three known letters (R,U,N) to pin down their positions.
- Avoid discarded letters: C,A,E,T,S.
- Use new letters to cover more ground.
- Place R, U, and N in positions we haven't tested yet.

Given the position constraints:
- R must be in position 3,4, or5 (since not1 or2)
- N must be in position 1,2, or5 (since not3 or4)
- U must not be in position2, so positions:1,3,4,5.

Now, we need to form a valid English word with these constraints.

Consider possible positions for each:
- Position 1: Could be N or U? Or a new letter? (not R position1 is ruled out)
- Position 2: Could be N? Or a new letter? (not R or U? Wait U cannot be at2 but others can)
- Etc.

We should test a word that puts R, U, N in different positions.

Also, we want words that incorporate common unused letters to get info? For example, O, I (vowels), or B, D, etc.

List possible words:

First, note that N can only be at 1,2,5? But if we put N at position1, and U at position1? Conflict? Positions are unique per letter.

Think of words with R,U,N and two other letters.

Possible words:

- Start with N? If N at position1: e.g., ""N_U_R"" but with U and R in middle?

For example, ""NURSE""? But S is out? Not allowed? S discarded.

""NURDS""? S discarded? ""NURDS"" is not a valid word. ""NURDS"" might be slang. Avoid if possible? Or ""NORTH""? Has T? T discarded? ""NOMAD""? Has A? A discarded.

Try incorporating vowels I or O? We haven't used them.

Example: ""ORCIN""? Invalid.

How about ""ROUND"": R at1, O at2, U at3, N at4, D at5? 
Problem: 
- In first guess, N at4 was misplaced? So if we put N at4? We know it's wrong? We haven't tested position5 for N? 
But wait: ""ROUND"" has R at1? We tried R at1 in second guess and it was marked wrong? So R at1 is wrong? So ""ROUND"" would have R at position1? Which we know is wrong? So that's a '-' again? 

But also: first guess had N at4? Wrong position? Second guess didn't test position4? But we believe N should not be at4? So in ""ROUND"", N at4 would be marked '-'? 

Moreover, ""ROUND"" doesn't include U? Wait, U is at position3? But in second guess, U was at position2? And we didn't test U at position3? 

But the letters: R,O,U,N,D? Avoids discarded letters? Discarded are C,A,E,T,S? So O and D are new? R,U,N are known? So it's possible? 

However, R at position1: In guess2 (""runts""), position1 was R? And we got '-', so R not at1? So we shouldn't put R at1? Because we already know it's not correct? 

Similarly, U: at position3? We only tested U at position2? So we don't know about position3? 

N: at position4? But in guess1 (""crane""), N was at position4? And we got '-'? So we know N is not at4? Therefore, putting N at position4 again would be a '-'? And no new info? 

Therefore, ""ROUND"" is inefficient because: 
- R at1: we already know R not at1? 
- N at4: already know N not at4? 
So both moves are wasted? 

Instead, we should form words that place:
- R in position 3,4, or5? And we haven't tested any of these? 
- Similarly, N at position 1,2, or5? 
- We haven't tested N at position1? Or position2? Or position5? 

Possible words with N at position1 or2? And R at 3,4,5? 

How about ""MINOR""? M,I,N,O,R? 
But note: we don't know if the word has M or I or O? But that's okay? 
But also: positions: 
Pos1: M? 
Pos2: I? 
Pos3: N? But wait, N at3? In guess2 (""runts""), we placed N at position3? And feedback was '-'? Meaning N is in word but not at3? So we shouldn't put N at3? 

Therefore: N cannot be at3? We must avoid position3 for N? 

Similarly: 
Possible positions for N? Only positions not tested? Meaning: since in guess1: position4? In guess2: position3? So left positions: 1,2,5? 

Similarly for R? Tested at position1? And position2? So left positions: 3,4,5? 

For U? Tested only at position2? So we can test at positions 1,3,4,5? 

Now, words: 

Option: Place N at position1? Then U at position3? R at position5? Etc? 
Structure: N _ U ? R? but R must be at5? 

Possible words: 
""NUBR_""? Not filling up easily? 

Also: since we have two unknown letters? 

Common letters left: O, I, D, L, M, H, etc. 

Another idea: ""FLUNG""? F,L,U,N,G? 
Positions: F(1),L(2),U(3),N(4),G(5)? 
But N at4? We know N is not at4? From first guess? And U at3? We haven't tested? 

Problem: L and F new? 
But: 
- U at3? 
- N at4? Which we know will be '-'? 
But we have no R? Wait, R is missing? But R must be in the word? 

We cannot omit R? 

The word must include R? 

So need R present? 

Therefore: a valid word must have R,U,N and two other letters? 

Another try: ""PRION""? But P,R,I,O,N? 
Positions: P(1),R(2),I(3),O(4),N(5)? 
Now: 
- R at2? In first guess (""crane""), R at2 was marked '-'? So we know R is not at2? Therefore, putting R at2 will result in '-'? 
- N at5? We haven't tested? 
- But we are putting R at2 which is known to be wrong? So wasted? 
We are trying to place R in a new position? Here at2 repeated? 

Better: ""PRION"" but R at2? Bad? 

How about ""UNRIG""? U(1),N(2),R(3),I(4),G(5)? 
Letters: U,N,R,I,G. Avoids discarded? 
Positions: 
Pos1: U? 
Pos2: N? We haven't tested N at2? 
Pos3: R? We haven't tested R at3? 
Pos4: I? 
Pos5: G? 

So: 
- U at position1: not tested? 
- N at position2: not tested? 
- R at position3: not tested? 
All new positions? 

Perfect? 

Also, avoids all discarded letters? 

So let's go with ""UNRIG"". 

Is ""UNRIG"" a valid word? Yes, meaning to unrig or dismantle? 

Therefore: UNRIG as next guess? 

Alternative: ""GUIRN"" — not common? 
""UNDID""? Has D, but U at1, N at2, D at4? No R? 
We need R? 

So ""UNRIG"" seems good? 

But wait: U was tested at pos2? In ""RUNTS"" we had U at2? Marked as '-'? So we cannot put U at2? But in UNRIG? U is at1? Which we haven't tested? 
Similarly, N is at2? Which we haven't tested? 

Yes? 

Therefore: guess ""UNRIG"". 

So: <guess>unrig</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

Include R and N (since they are in the word).\n 2. Avoid using C, A, E (because they are not in the word).\n 3. Try to place R and N in different positions to check their correct spots.\n\n Also, we can consider other common letters. Since we have only used 5 letters, we should try other vowels or common consonants.\n\n The vowels we haven\'t tried yet: I, O, U. We know A and E are out. So maybe we can try a word with I or O.\n\n Since R is in the word, and it was misplaced at position 2, let\'s try putting R in a different position (like position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5). Similarly for N.\n\n But note: we have two letters that must be included: R and N.\n\n We also have to avoid C, A, E.\n\n Let\'s brainstorm words that include R and N and use other vowels.\n\n We also want to use new letters to get more information.\n\n Since we only have two known letters (R and N), we need to cover more of the alphabet.\n\n Alternative common consonants: T, S, L, etc.\n\n One idea: Try a word starting with T? Or S? Since we have excluded C.\n\n Possible words: ""TRUNK"", ""BORNS"", but need valid words.\n\n However, note that the feedback does not tell us the number of occurrences. So if we use a letter twice, we might get confused. Therefore, we should try words with distinct letters when possible.\n\n Let\'s try to use R and N and three new letters.\n\n Possible vowels: O and I. We can also try U but it\'s less common.\n\n Example words that have R and N and avoid C, A, E:\n\n - ""HORNS"": H, O, R, N, S -> but we haven\'t tried H, O, S. However, note that we must place R and N in positions different from the first guess? Not necessarily, because the word might have multiple positions, but we don\'t know duplicates. So let\'s avoid duplicate letters for now.\n\n Since the first guess had R at position 2 and it was wrong, and N at position 4 and it was wrong, we can try R at position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5, and N at a different position.\n\n But note: the secret word must have R and N. Let\'s try putting R at position 1 and N at position 3? Or R at position 4?\n\n Also, we don\'t know how many letters are known so far? Only two.\n\n We need three more.\n\n Another common starting word after excluding A, E: we can use I and O.\n\n How about ""PRINT""? \n - P is new, R we know, I is new, N we know, T is new?\n But wait, R is at position 2 again? Because ""PRINT"" has P (1), R (2), I (3), N (4), T (5). \n However, in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong, so if we put R again at position 2, it might still be wrong? But if the word has two R\'s? We don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, move R to a different position? For example, place R at position 3?\n\n We can choose a word that has R at position 1? And N at position 4? Or N at position 5?\n\n Example words:\n\n - ""ROUND"": R, O, U, N, D -> but U is not very common. Also, we have O and U as new vowels. But avoids C,A,E. However, we tried A and E and they are out. This word places R at 1 and N at 4.\n\n - ""HORNS"": R at 3 and N at 4? No: H(1),O(2),R(3),N(4),S(5). We haven\'t tried positions 1, 3, 5 for R and N. In the first guess, R was at 2 and N at 4.\n\n Alternatively, we might consider ""BORNS"" but that\'s not a word. How about ""BORNE""? But E is out.\n\n Another word: ""IRONY"" - I(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5). But that\'s five letters and avoids A,E,C? But R is at 2 again. However, we can try it? But R at 2 was already tested and marked as wrong? It might be that the word has R at 2? Not necessarily because if the word has two R\'s? We don\'t have information about duplicate letters.\n\n However, note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was marked with \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 2. Therefore, R cannot be at position 2. So if we choose a word with R at position 2, we will definitely get a \'-\' again? Or if the word has another R? But we don\'t know.\n\n Since we want to maximize information, let\'s avoid putting R in the same position again (position 2) and avoid position 2 for N? Well, for N: we had it at position 4 and it was marked wrong. So we should try N in a new position.\n\n Rule: for a known letter, try it in a position we haven\'t tried before.\n\n So, for R: we have only tried position 2, so we can try positions 1, 3, 4, 5.\n For N: we have only tried position 4, so we can try 1, 2, 3, 5.\n\n Therefore, let\'s try a word that has R in a position we haven\'t tried and N in a position we haven\'t tried.\n\n Also, use letters we haven\'t tried to get more information.\n\n We\'ve tried: C, R, A, N, E -> so avoid these? Actually, avoid C, A, E and use other letters.\n\n Then, the available letters are: \n Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we know the word has R and N)\n Vowels: I, O, U (A and E are out)\n\n Now, we want to cover common letters. Maybe try S and T? They are very common.\n\n Suggested word: ""STORM""\n But ""STORM"" has S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), M(5). \n - Here, R is at position 4 (a new position) and N? We don\'t have N. But we know N must be in the word! So we cannot omit N.\n\n So we need a word that includes both R and N.\n\n How about ""STERN""? \n - S, T, E, R, N -> but E is out! We can\'t use E.\n\n We must avoid E. So ""STERN"" is bad.\n\n How about ""STRON""? Not a word.\n\n ""STORN""? Not a word.\n\n ""TRINS""? Not a word.\n\n Another word: ""PRION""? Not common.\n\n Let me suggest:\n ""GROIN"" : G(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), N(5)\n But R is at position 2 again? We should avoid that? However, if the word has two R\'s, we might get feedback on the second occurrence? But we don\'t have to avoid it entirely? It\'s okay to put R at 2 again? We don\'t know the duplicates? But the feedback might tell us.\n\n Alternatively, let me think of a word with R at a position other than 2 and N at a position other than 4.\n\n Example: ""BRING"" -> B(1), R(2) ... again R at 2. We want to move R.\n\n Also, ""BRING"" has E? No: B,R,I,N,G. But wait, no E? And avoids C,A,E? But R is at 2 again.\n\n Words with R not at 2:\n - ""DRINK"": D(1), R(2) ... same issue.\n - ""FROWN"": F(1), R(2) ... again.\n\n Let me try to put R at position 1? \n - ""ROUND"": R,O,U,N,D -> R at 1, N at 4? We tried N at 4 already? Yes, in ""crane"", N was at 4 and mispositioned. So we can try N at a different position? In ""ROUND"", N is at position 4? That\'s the same? So it would be marked as \'-\'? And we wouldn\'t learn a new position for N.\n\n Alternatively, ""RINSE"": R,I,N,S,E -> but E is out. Not allowed.\n\n ""RANKS"": has A? A is out.\n\n ""RONIN"": not a word? Actually, it\'s a word (historical term), but let\'s avoid.\n\n How about ""GROWN"": G(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). \n - R at 2? We have position 2 for R already tested? But we can try? But N at position 5? We haven\'t tried N at 5.\n\n This word: G, R, O, W, N -> avoids C,A,E and includes R and N.\n\n We can learn: \n - Positions: R at 2? If it\'s not the correct position (which we know from previous it isn\'t) then it will be \'-\'. And N at position 5: if it is correct, we get ✓, or \'-\' otherwise.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put R at a completely new position? Let\'s look for words with R at 3 or 4.\n\n Words with R at 3: ""TRIBE"" -> T,R,I,B,E -> E not allowed? ""TRICK"" -> no A,E but has C? C is also out? We cannot use C.\n\n How about ""PRINT"" again? But R is at 2? No: in ""PRINT"", R is at position 2? \n\n How about: ""SPURN"": S(1), P(2), U(3), R(4), N(5). \n That\'s good: R at position 4 and N at position 5? Both positions are new (we had R at 2 and N at 4 only). Also, uses S,P,U which are new. Avoids C,A,E.\n\n So ""SPURN"": \n - Pos1: S, we don\'t know -> if in word and correct? etc.\n - Pos2: P? \n - Pos3: U?\n - Pos4: R? We are trying R at position 4.\n - Pos5: N? We are trying N at position 5.\n\n This seems like a decent guess.\n\n Let\'s consider: The secret word must have R and N, so we are covering that. We are also introducing S, P, U.\n\n How about another option? ""SHRUN"": not a word.\n\n ""SPURN"" is valid? Yes, it means to reject or something.\n\n So let\'s try ""SPURN"".\n\n But we can also think of other words.\n\n Another word: ""BORNS"" is not valid. How about ""HORNS""? \n ""HORNS"": H(1),O(2),R(3),N(4),S(5) -> \n - R at position 3 (we haven\'t tried) and N at position 4? We have tried N at position 4? In ""crane"", N was at position 4? So we already know N is at position 4? And it\'s wrong? So we get a \'-\' again? And we don\'t learn a new position? \n - Therefore, we cannot rule out if N is at position 4? Actually, the previous guess told us that N is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, in ""HORNS"", if we put N at position 4, we will definitely get a \'-\'? Because it\'s in the word but at wrong position? But doesn\'t matter? We still get the information that N isn\'t at position 4? We already know? So it will be marked \'-\'.\n\n So it\'s okay? Actually, we can try N at position 4 again? It will still be \'-\'. But it won\'t provide new information about N? So it\'s more efficient to try a word that has N in a new position? So that we can see if we get a ✓? And if not, then we know it\'s in the remaining positions.\n\n Therefore, we prefer to move N to a new position? But positions for N are 1,2,3,5 left? \n\n So in ""HORNS"": N is at 4 which we already know is wrong? So it will be \'-\'? That gives us no new information? And then we can\'t tell about the new position? \n\n So I think ""SPURN"" is better? Because it moves both R and N to new positions.\n\n Alternatively, ""RUNTS"": R(1),U(2),N(3),T(4),S(5) -> \n This uses: R at 1 (new), U, N at 3 (new), T, S? And avoids C,A,E.\n\n Yes, ""RUNTS"" is a word? (meaning: undersized animals)\n\n So ""RUNTS"": \n - R at position 1, which we haven\'t tested? Can be ✓ or whatever? \n - U at 2?\n - N at position 3 (new) vs position 4 we know?\n - Then T and S.\n\n So this also seems good? But note: we have only one vowel? U? But vowels are important? Or is U acceptable? We don\'t know.\n\n We need to pick one.\n\n Choose between ""SPURN"" and ""RUNTS"". Both cover new positions for R and N? \n In ""RUNTS"": R at 1, N at 3? And in the first guess, R was at position 2, and N at position 4? So both positions are new? \n\n How about ""PRONG"": P(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), G(5)? \n But R is at 2? And we already know position 2 is wrong? So we hope that if R is at 2? But the feedback already said R isn\'t at 2? So it is likely to be \'-\'? Unless there is a duplicate? And N at position 4? We know it\'s wrong too? \n\n So we don\'t want to do that? \n\n Alternatively, ""SPRING"" is 6 letters? Wait, we need 5.\n\n We have to pick a 5-letter word.\n\n Consider: ""TRUNK"": T(1), R(2), U(2), N(4), K(5). \n - R at 2 is already known wrong? And N at 4 is known wrong? So we would get \'-\' for both? And we introduce T,U,K? But we don\'t learn new positions.\n\n So less efficient? \n\n Another word: ""BIRTH""? No N.\n\n We must have R and N.\n\n Conclusion: I think ""SPURN"" or ""RUNTS"" are good?\n\n Let me go with ""RUNTS"". It has R at position 1 and N at position 3? And uses T and S which are very common? And U is the only vowel? It might be informative.\n\n Therefore, my next guess: ""RUNTS"".\n\n But let me check if ""RUNTS"" is valid? Yes.\n\n So <guess> runts </guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- C, A, and E are **not in the word**.  \n- R and N **are in the word but in the wrong positions** (R was position 2, N was position 4).  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n- Must include R and N (since they are confirmed present).  \n- Avoid C, A, E (since they are absent).  \n- Place R and N in **new positions** to test their correct locations (e.g., avoid R at position 2 and N at position 4).  \n- Introduce new common letters to gather more information, prioritizing unused consonants like S and T.  \n\nThe word **""RUNTS""** fits these criteria:  \n- R is placed at position 1 (new, untested position).  \n- N is placed at position 3 (new position, compared to the previous position 4).  \n- Includes fresh letters: U (vowel), T (common consonant), and S (common consonant).  \n- Avoids forbidden letters C, A, E.\n\n<guess>runts</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: runts -> FEEDBACK: R(-) U(-) N(-) T(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'After the second guess ""runts"", the feedback is: R(-), U(-), N(-), T(x), S(x)\n\nBreaking this down:\n- R is in the word but not at position 1 (our guess had R at position 1, marked wrong position).\n- U is in the word but not at position 2 (guessed at 2, marked wrong position).\n- N is in the word but not at position 3 (guessed at 3, marked wrong position).\n- T is not in the word at all (x).\n- S is not in the word at all (x).\n\nWe also recall from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, E are not in the word.\n- R was at position 2 (wrong position), now at position 1 also wrong position.\n- N was at position 4 (wrong position), now at position 3 also wrong position.\n\nSo, the secret word:\n- Contains: R, U, N (confirmed present by both guesses).\n- Does NOT contain: C, A, E, T, S (all marked x).\n- Letters tried so far: C, R, A, N, E (from first guess) and R, U, N, T, S (from second).

However, we don\'t have evidence of duplicates, so we\'ll assume distinct for now until feedback forces otherwise.\n\nThe secret word must consist of R, U, N, and two other letters we haven\'t tried yet, excluding the discarded ones.\n\nDiscarded: C,A,E,T,S — so available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z, and vowels: I,O remain unused.\n\nWe have three known letters: R, U, N. We need a 5-letter word, so two more unknown letters to discover.\n\nOur next guess should:\n- Include all three known letters (R,U,N) to pin down their positions.\n- Avoid discarded letters: C,A,E,T,S.\n- Use new letters to cover more ground.\n- Place R, U, and N in positions we haven\'t tested yet.\n\nGiven the position constraints:\n- R must be in position 3,4, or5 (since not1 or2)\n- N must be in position 1,2, or5 (since not3 or4)\n- U must not be in position2, so positions:1,3,4,5.\n\nNow, we need to form a valid English word with these constraints.\n\nConsider possible positions for each:\n- Position 1: Could be N or U? Or a new letter? (not R position1 is ruled out)\n- Position 2: Could be N? Or a new letter? (not R or U?

Positions are unique per letter.\n\nThink of words with R,U,N and two other letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- Start with N? If N at position1: e.g., ""N_U_R"" but with U and R in middle?\n\nFor example, ""NURSE""? But S is out? Not allowed? S discarded.\n\n""NURDS""? S discarded? ""NURDS"" is not a valid word. ""NURDS"" might be slang. Avoid if possible? Or ""NORTH""? Has T? T discarded? ""NOMAD""? Has A? A discarded.\n\nTry incorporating vowels I or O? We haven\'t used them.\n\nExample: ""ORCIN""? Invalid.\n\nHow about ""ROUND"": R at1, O at2, U at3, N at4, D at5? \nProblem: \n- In first guess, N at4 was misplaced? So if we put N at4? We know it\'s wrong? We haven\'t tested position5 for N? \nBut wait: ""ROUND"" has R at1? We tried R at1 in second guess and it was marked wrong? So R at1 is wrong? So ""ROUND"" would have R at position1? Which we know is wrong? So that\'s a \'-\' again? \n\nBut also: first guess had N at4? Wrong position? Second guess didn\'t test position4? But we believe N should not be at4? So in ""ROUND"", N at4 would be marked \'-\'? \n\nMoreover, ""ROUND"" doesn\'t include U? Wait, U is at position3? But in second guess, U was at position2? And we didn\'t test U at position3? \n\nBut the letters: R,O,U,N,D? Avoids discarded letters? Discarded are C,A,E,T,S? So O and D are new? R,U,N are known? So it\'s possible? \n\nHowever, R at position1: In guess2 (""runts""), position1 was R? And we got \'-\', so R not at1? So we shouldn\'t put R at1? Because we already know it\'s not correct? \n\nSimilarly, U: at position3? We only tested U at position2? So we don\'t know about position3? \n\nN: at position4? But in guess1 (""crane""), N was at position4? And we got \'-\'? So we know N is not at4? Therefore, putting N at position4 again would be a \'-\'? And no new info? \n\nTherefore, ""ROUND"" is inefficient because: \n- R at1: we already know R not at1? \n- N at4: already know N not at4? \nSo both moves are wasted? \n\nInstead, we should form words that place:\n- R in position 3,4, or5? And we haven\'t tested any of these? \n- Similarly, N at position 1,2, or5? \n- We haven\'t tested N at position1? Or position2? Or position5? \n\nPossible words with N at position1 or2? And R at 3,4,5? \n\nHow about ""MINOR""? M,I,N,O,R? \nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has M or I or O? But that\'s okay? \nBut also: positions: \nPos1: M? \nPos2: I? \nPos3: N? But wait, N at3? In guess2 (""runts""), we placed N at position3? And feedback was \'-\'? Meaning N is in word but not at3? So we shouldn\'t put N at3? \n\nTherefore: N cannot be at3? We must avoid position3 for N? \n\nSimilarly: \nPossible positions for N? Only positions not tested? Meaning: since in guess1: position4? In guess2: position3? So left positions: 1,2,5? \n\nSimilarly for R? Tested at position1? And position2? So left positions: 3,4,5? \n\nFor U? Tested only at position2? So we can test at positions 1,3,4,5? \n\nNow, words: \n\nOption: Place N at position1? Then U at position3? R at position5? Etc? \nStructure: N _ U ? R? but R must be at5? \n\nPossible words: \n""NUBR_""? Not filling up easily? \n\nAlso: since we have two unknown letters? \n\nCommon letters left: O, I, D, L, M, H, etc. \n\nAnother idea: ""FLUNG""? F,L,U,N,G? \nPositions: F(1),L(2),U(3),N(4),G(5)? \nBut N at4? We know N is not at4? From first guess? And U at3? We haven\'t tested? \n\nProblem: L and F new? \nBut: \n- U at3? \n- N at4? Which we know will be \'-\'? \nBut we have no R? Wait, R is missing? But R must be in the word? \n\nWe cannot omit R? \n\nThe word must include R? \n\nSo need R present? \n\nTherefore: a valid word must have R,U,N and two other letters? \n\nAnother try: ""PRION""? But P,R,I,O,N? \nPositions: P(1),R(2),I(3),O(4),N(5)? \nNow: \n- R at2? In first guess (""crane""), R at2 was marked \'-\'? So we know R is not at2? Therefore, putting R at2 will result in \'-\'? \n- N at5? We haven\'t tested? \n- But we are putting R at2 which is known to be wrong? So wasted? \nWe are trying to place R in a new position? Here at2 repeated? \n\nBetter: ""PRION"" but R at2? Bad? \n\nHow about ""UNRIG""? U(1),N(2),R(3),I(4),G(5)? \nLetters: U,N,R,I,G. Avoids discarded? \nPositions: \nPos1: U? \nPos2: N? We haven\'t tested N at2? \nPos3: R? We haven\'t tested R at3? \nPos4: I? \nPos5: G? \n\nSo: \n- U at position1: not tested? \n- N at position2: not tested? \n- R at position3: not tested? \nAll new positions? \n\nPerfect? \n\nAlso, avoids all discarded letters? \n\nSo let\'s go with ""UNRIG"". \n\nIs ""UNRIG"" a valid word? Yes, meaning to unrig or dismantle? \n\nTherefore: UNRIG as next guess? \n\nAlternative: ""GUIRN"" — not common? \n""UNDID""? Has D, but U at1, N at2, D at4? No R? \nWe need R? \n\nSo ""UNRIG"" seems good? \n\nBut wait: U was tested at pos2? In ""RUNTS"" we had U at2? Marked as \'-\'? So we cannot put U at2? But in UNRIG? U is at1? Which we haven\'t tested? \nSimilarly, N is at2? Which we haven\'t tested? \n\nYes? \n\nTherefore: guess ""UNRIG"". \n\nSo: <guess>unrig</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n\n**Guess 1: crane**\n- Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)\n- **Key insights**:\n  - C, A, E: Not in the word.\n  - R: In the word, but not at position 2.\n  - N: In the word, but not at position 4.\n\n**Guess 2: runts**\n- Feedback: R(-) U(-) N(-) T(x) S(x)\n- **Key insights**:\n  - R: Still in the word, but not at position 1 (new info).\n  - U: In the word, but not at position 2 (new info).\n  - N: Still in the word, but not at position 3 (new info).\n  - T, S: Not in the word.\n\n### Summary of Constraints:\n- **Confirmed present letters**: R, U, N.\n- **Absent letters**: C, A, E, T, S.\n- **Position constraints**:\n  - R cannot be at position 1 or 2 → Must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.\n  - U cannot be at position 2 → Must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n  - N cannot be at position 3 or 4 → Must be in positions 1, 2, or 5.\n- **Letters tested so far**: C, R, A, N, E, U, T, S.\n- **Untested letters**: Many remain (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).\n\n### Next Guess Requirements:\n- Must include R, U, and N to resolve their positions.\n- Avoid discarded letters: C, A, E, T, S.\n- Prioritize placing R, U, N in **untested positions**:\n  - R: Test positions 3, 4, or 5 (positions 1 and 2 ruled out).\n  - U: Test positions other than 2 (positions 1, 3, 4, 5 available).\n  - N: Test positions 1, 2, or 5 (positions 3 and 4 ruled out).\n- Introduce new high-frequency letters (e.g., O, I, L, D) to maximize information.\n\n### Selected Guess: ""UNRIG""\n- **Breakdown**:\n  - U at position 1: Untested for U (previously tested at position 2).\n  - N at position 2: Untested for N (previously tested at positions 3 and 4).\n  - R at position 3: Untested for R (previously tested at positions 1 and 2).\n  - Introduces new letters: I (position 4) and G (position 5).\n- **Why ""UNRIG""?** \n  - 100% satisfies position constraints for R, U, N.\n  - Valid English word (verb: to dismantle rigging).\n  - Avoids discarded letters.\n  - Maximizes new information by testing R/U/N in fresh positions and adding I/G.\n\n**Final Guess**:\n\n<guess>unrig</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: runts -> FEEDBACK: R(-) U(-) N(-) T(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: unrig -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(-) R(-) I(x) G(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:
1. crane: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(x) → R and N are in the word but not at positions 2 and 4, respectively.
2. runts: R(-), U(-), N(-), T(x), S(x) → R (position1), U (position2), N (position3) are present but misplaced; T and S absent.
3. unrig: U(-), N(-), R(-), I(x), G(x) → U (position1), N (position2), R (position3) are present but misplaced; I and G absent.

Summary:
- Known present letters: R, U, N (from multiple guesses confirming they are in the word).
- Absent letters: C, A, E, T, S, I, G (marked with 'x' in some guess).
- Positions tried:
  - R: positions 1, 2, 3 → all wrong. So R must be in position 4 or 5.
  - U: positions 1, 2 → both wrong. So U must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
  - N: positions 2, 3, 4 → all wrong. So N must be in position 1 or 5.

Since the word has 5 letters and must include all of R, U, N, with the position constraints:

- N must be at position 1 or 5.
- R must be at position 4 or 5.
- U must be at position 3, 4, or 5.

But note: position 5 can only hold one letter. Therefore, we must assign these to different positions.

Consider the constraints:
1. If N is at position 1, then:
   - R must be at 4 or 5.
   - U must be at 3, 4, or 5.
   But R and U both could need position 5? So conflict unless we use different positions.

Possible scenarios:

Option A: N at position 1.
Then:
- R at position 4 or 5.
- U at position 3, 4, or 5.

We must assign distinct positions.

Possible combinations:
- N@1, U@3, R@4: positions left for the other two letters? Position 2 and 5.
- N@1, U@3, R@5: then position 4 empty?
- N@1, U@4, R@5: conflict? Or no, because positions: 1(N), then U at 4 and R at 5? But what about position 3? We need all positions filled.

Option B: N at position 5.
Then:
- R at position 4? (since if at position 5, conflict with N? So R must be at 4? Because position 5 is taken by N).
- Then U must be at position 3? (since positions 4 and 5 taken? Or U could be at 3?).

Let's break it down.

Case 1: N at position 1.
Then:
- U can be at 3, 4, or 5? Not at 2? But 2 is available? Actually U can be at any position except 1,2? We only tested positions 1 and 2? So U can be at 3,4,5? Similarly available positions: 2,3,4,5? But N at1? So left: 2,3,4,5.

Now, R must be at4 or5? So:

Option A: N@1, R@4, U at? Free positions: 2,3,5? But U must be placed, and U can be at 3,4,5? But position4 is taken by R? So U can be at 3 or 5? 

Then:
- If U at3: remaining positions: 2 and 5? For letters? But we have two more letters? Note: the word has five distinct letters? Or could have duplicates? No? Since we haven't seen any duplicates? 

We have three letters: R,U,N? And two more? 

So for this case: positions:
- 1: N
- 4: R
- 3: U? Then positions 2 and 5? Need letters? 

Then the word: [N] [ ? ] [U] [R] [?]

What letter can be at2 and5? They must be letters not discarded? Discarded: C,A,E,T,S,I,G? So many letters left: B,D,F,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? And vowels: O?

Similarly, if U at5 in case A: then word: [N] [ ? ] [ ? ] [R] [U]

Option B: N@1, R@5, U@? Then free positions: 2,3,4? U must be placed? Can be at3 or4? 
- If U@3: word [N][?][U][?][R]
- If U@4: [N][?][?][U][R]

But note: we also have the possibility: U@4 and R@5? But then position4 is U? And position5 is R? 

Case 2: N at position5.
Then R must be at position4? Because R must be at4 or5? But position5 taken? So R at4? Then U must be at position3? Because positions left? Positions 1,2,3? And U must be at3,4,5? But 4 and5 taken? So U must be at3? 

Then word structure: [?][?][U][R][N]

So two possibilities? 
1. N at1, U at3, R at4: [N][?][U][R][?]
2. N at1, U at5, R at4: [N][?][?][R][U]
3. N at5, R at4, U at3: [?][?][U][R][N]

We need to guess which? And the remaining positions? 

We can form words accordingly? 

We also know: must avoid C,A,E,T,S,I,G? 

So let's try to find words fitting:

Pattern 1: N _ U R ? ? Missing letters at position2 and5? 
Position5: letter? 

Words: 
- ""NOURR""? Not valid? 
- ""NODUR""? Not? 
- ""N OH UR?""? 

Think of ""NOURL""? Not valid? 
How about ""HOURN""? No? 

Pattern 1: N ? U R ? ? Position5: ? 

Possible: position2 must be a letter? And position5? 

Example: ""NOUR""? But 4 letters? 

5-letter words? 
- ""NOURD""? Not a word? 
- ""DOURN""? Not valid? 
- ""LOURN""? Not? 

Pattern 2: N at1, R at4, U at5: N ? ? R U? 
Then word: N _ _ R U? 
Examples: ""NOMRU""? 
Common word? How about ""NEGRU""? N,E,G,R,U? But E and G are discarded? 

Discarded: E? So avoid.

Try ""NABRU""? Not? 

Pattern 3: [?][?]UR? and N at5: _ _ U R N? 

Words ending with URN? But that's 3? Actually, words ending with ""URN"": e.g., ""BURN"", ""TURN"", ""MOURN""? But we need 5 letters? 

Examples: 
- ""DOURN"" not valid? 
- ""LOURN"" not valid? 
- ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N? But 5 letters? Positions: 
  M(1),O(2),U(3),R(4),N(5)? 

Check: 
- U at3? Not tested? 
- R at4? Not tested? 
- N at5? Not tested? 
And U,R,N at positions that should be allowed? 
Also, avoids discarded? Discarded: C,A,E,T,S,I,G? M,O are new? 

So ""MOURN""? Meaning: to be sad? 

But let me confirm: 
In ""MOURN"": 
- M is new? 
- O is new? 

We have never tested U at3? Or R at4? Or N at5? 

This fits the pattern exactly? 

But in our constraint, Pattern 3: N at5, R at4, U at3? 

But we also have U at3? So ""MOURN"" is a valid word? 

Are there other possibilities? 

Another pattern: if N at1? For example, ""NURRY""? Not valid? Or ""NOURK""? 

But ""MOURN"" seems valid? 

Therefore, let's guess ""MOURN"". 

But wait: in pattern 3? We have position2? Which must be filled? 

""MOURN"": 
- Pos1: M?
- Pos2: O?
- Pos3: U?
- Pos4: R?
- Pos5: N?

Now, check constraints:
- R: we've used at position4? Which is untested? So we hope?
- U: at3? Untested?
- N: at5? Untested?

Also, avoids all discarded letters? M,O not discarded? 

Yes? 

But let's consider if there are other words? 

For pattern 1? What about ""NOHUR""? Not valid? Or ""NUKUR""? 

But ""MOURN"" seems acceptable? 

Therefore, our guess: ""MOURN""

But note: we have used O? 

We must avoid any discarded? So M,O,U,R,N? U,R,N known and O,M new? And allowed? 

So <guess>mourn</guess>

But wait: we haven't tested any of these placements? 

Alternatively, but what about ""BOUND""? B,O,U,N,D? But N? We need R? 

We must include R? 

So we need R? 

So ""MOURN"" is a candidate? 

Another option: ""OUR"" ending? 

Example: ""HOURN""? Not valid? 

So I think ""MOURN"" is the best shot? 

So proceed.
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback

After three guesses, the confirmed information is:

1. **Present Letters**:
   - **R**: In the word but not at positions 1, 2, or 3.
   - **U**: In the word but not at positions 1 or 2.
   - **N**: In the word but not at positions 2, 3, or 4.

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   C, A, E, T, S, I, G (all marked ""x"").

3. **Position Constraints**:  
   - **R** must be at position 4 or 5 (only untested positions left).  
   - **U** must be at position 3, 4, or 5 (position 5 is the only position not tested for R and U).  
   - **N** must be at position 1 or 5 (position 5 is the only untested position for N).  
   Since positions 4 and 5 are constrained for R, U, and N, the most likely arrangement avoids conflicts:  
   - If **N** is at position 5, **R** must be at position 4 (since position 5 is occupied), and **U** must be at position 3 (positions 4 and 5 taken).  
   - The word structure would be: `[?] [?] [U] [R] [N]`, with positions 1 and 2 filled by new, unused letters.

4. **Untested Letters**:  
   Focus on common unused consonants (e.g., B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P) and vowels (O is the most common untested vowel).

5. **Valid Word Candidates**:  
   Fitting `_ _ U R N` with discarded letters avoided (no C, A, E, T, S, I, G) yields words like **""MOURN""** (valid 5-letter word meaning to grieve).  
   - Positions: M(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), N(5).  
   - Satisfies all constraints: U at position 3 (new), R at position 4 (new), N at position 5 (new).

**Next Guess**: ""MOURN""  
- Tests R, U, N in untested positions (3, 4, 5).  
- Introduces new letters M and O for broader coverage.

<guess>mourn</guess>",mourn,"We have feedback from three guesses:
1. crane: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(x) → R and N are in the word but not at positions 2 and 4, respectively.
2. runts: R(-), U(-), N(-), T(x), S(x) → R (position1), U (position2), N (position3) are present but misplaced; T and S absent.
3. unrig: U(-), N(-), R(-), I(x), G(x) → U (position1), N (position2), R (position3) are present but misplaced; I and G absent.

Summary:
- Known present letters: R, U, N (from multiple guesses confirming they are in the word).
- Absent letters: C, A, E, T, S, I, G (marked with 'x' in some guess).
- Positions tried:
  - R: positions 1, 2, 3 → all wrong. So R must be in position 4 or 5.
  - U: positions 1, 2 → both wrong. So U must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
  - N: positions 2, 3, 4 → all wrong. So N must be in position 1 or 5.

Since the word has 5 letters and must include all of R, U, N, with the position constraints:

- N must be at position 1 or 5.
- R must be at position 4 or 5.
- U must be at position 3, 4, or 5.

But note: position 5 can only hold one letter. Therefore, we must assign these to different positions.

Consider the constraints:
1. If N is at position 1, then:
   - R must be at 4 or 5.
   - U must be at 3, 4, or 5.
   But R and U both could need position 5? So conflict unless we use different positions.

Possible scenarios:

Option A: N at position 1.
Then:
- R at position 4 or 5.
- U at position 3, 4, or 5.

We must assign distinct positions.

Possible combinations:
- N@1, U@3, R@4: positions left for the other two letters? Position 2 and 5.
- N@1, U@3, R@5: then position 4 empty?
- N@1, U@4, R@5: conflict? Or no, because positions: 1(N), then U at 4 and R at 5? But what about position 3? We need all positions filled.

Option B: N at position 5.
Then:
- R at position 4? (since if at position 5, conflict with N? So R must be at 4? Because position 5 is taken by N).
- Then U must be at position 3? (since positions 4 and 5 taken? Or U could be at 3?).

Let's break it down.

Case 1: N at position 1.
Then:
- U can be at 3, 4, or 5? Not at 2? But 2 is available? Actually U can be at any position except 1,2? We only tested positions 1 and 2? So U can be at 3,4,5? Similarly available positions: 2,3,4,5? But N at1? So left: 2,3,4,5.

Now, R must be at4 or5? So:

Option A: N@1, R@4, U at? Free positions: 2,3,5? But U must be placed, and U can be at 3,4,5? But position4 is taken by R? So U can be at 3 or 5? 

Then:
- If U at3: remaining positions: 2 and 5? For letters? But we have two more letters? Note: the word has five distinct letters? Or could have duplicates? No? Since we haven't seen any duplicates? 

We have three letters: R,U,N? And two more? 

So for this case: positions:
- 1: N
- 4: R
- 3: U? Then positions 2 and 5? Need letters? 

Then the word: [N] [ ? ] [U] [R] [?]

What letter can be at2 and5? They must be letters not discarded? Discarded: C,A,E,T,S,I,G? So many letters left: B,D,F,H,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? And vowels: O?

Similarly, if U at5 in case A: then word: [N] [ ? ] [ ? ] [R] [U]

Option B: N@1, R@5, U@? Then free positions: 2,3,4? U must be placed? Can be at3 or4? 
- If U@3: word [N][?][U][?][R]
- If U@4: [N][?][?][U][R]

But note: we also have the possibility: U@4 and R@5? But then position4 is U? And position5 is R? 

Case 2: N at position5.
Then R must be at position4? Because R must be at4 or5? But position5 taken? So R at4? Then U must be at position3? Because positions left? Positions 1,2,3? And U must be at3,4,5? But 4 and5 taken? So U must be at3? 

Then word structure: [?][?][U][R][N]

So two possibilities? 
1. N at1, U at3, R at4: [N][?][U][R][?]
2. N at1, U at5, R at4: [N][?][?][R][U]
3. N at5, R at4, U at3: [?][?][U][R][N]

We need to guess which? And the remaining positions? 

We can form words accordingly? 

We also know: must avoid C,A,E,T,S,I,G? 

So let's try to find words fitting:

Pattern 1: N _ U R ? ? Missing letters at position2 and5? 
Position5: letter? 

Words: 
- ""NOURR""? Not valid? 
- ""NODUR""? Not? 
- ""N OH UR?""? 

Think of ""NOURL""? Not valid? 
How about ""HOURN""? No? 

Pattern 1: N ? U R ? ? Position5: ? 

Possible: position2 must be a letter? And position5? 

Example: ""NOUR""? But 4 letters? 

5-letter words? 
- ""NOURD""? Not a word? 
- ""DOURN""? Not valid? 
- ""LOURN""? Not? 

Pattern 2: N at1, R at4, U at5: N ? ? R U? 
Then word: N _ _ R U? 
Examples: ""NOMRU""? 
Common word? How about ""NEGRU""? N,E,G,R,U? But E and G are discarded? 

Discarded: E? So avoid.

Try ""NABRU""? Not? 

Pattern 3: [?][?]UR? and N at5: _ _ U R N? 

Words ending with URN? But that's 3? Actually, words ending with ""URN"": e.g., ""BURN"", ""TURN"", ""MOURN""? But we need 5 letters? 

Examples: 
- ""DOURN"" not valid? 
- ""LOURN"" not valid? 
- ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N? But 5 letters? Positions: 
  M(1),O(2),U(3),R(4),N(5)? 

Check: 
- U at3? Not tested? 
- R at4? Not tested? 
- N at5? Not tested? 
And U,R,N at positions that should be allowed? 
Also, avoids discarded? Discarded: C,A,E,T,S,I,G? M,O are new? 

So ""MOURN""? Meaning: to be sad? 

But let me confirm: 
In ""MOURN"": 
- M is new? 
- O is new? 

We have never tested U at3? Or R at4? Or N at5? 

This fits the pattern exactly? 

But in our constraint, Pattern 3: N at5, R at4, U at3? 

But we also have U at3? So ""MOURN"" is a valid word? 

Are there other possibilities? 

Another pattern: if N at1? For example, ""NURRY""? Not valid? Or ""NOURK""? 

But ""MOURN"" seems valid? 

Therefore, let's guess ""MOURN"". 

But wait: in pattern 3? We have position2? Which must be filled? 

""MOURN"": 
- Pos1: M?
- Pos2: O?
- Pos3: U?
- Pos4: R?
- Pos5: N?

Now, check constraints:
- R: we've used at position4? Which is untested? So we hope?
- U: at3? Untested?
- N: at5? Untested?

Also, avoids all discarded letters? M,O not discarded? 

Yes? 

But let's consider if there are other words? 

For pattern 1? What about ""NOHUR""? Not valid? Or ""NUKUR""? 

But ""MOURN"" seems acceptable? 

Therefore, our guess: ""MOURN""

But note: we have used O? 

We must avoid any discarded? So M,O,U,R,N? U,R,N known and O,M new? And allowed? 

So <guess>mourn</guess>

But wait: we haven't tested any of these placements? 

Alternatively, but what about ""BOUND""? B,O,U,N,D? But N? We need R? 

We must include R? 

So we need R? 

So ""MOURN"" is a candidate? 

Another option: ""OUR"" ending? 

Example: ""HOURN""? Not valid? 

So I think ""MOURN"" is the best shot? 

So proceed.### Analysis of Previous Feedback

After three guesses, the confirmed information is:

1. **Present Letters**:
   - **R**: In the word but not at positions 1, 2, or 3.
   - **U**: In the word but not at positions 1 or 2.
   - **N**: In the word but not at positions 2, 3, or 4.

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   C, A, E, T, S, I, G (all marked ""x"").

3. **Position Constraints**:  
   - **R** must be at position 4 or 5 (only untested positions left).  
   - **U** must be at position 3, 4, or 5 (position 5 is the only position not tested for R and U).  
   - **N** must be at position 1 or 5 (position 5 is the only untested position for N).  
   Since positions 4 and 5 are constrained for R, U, and N, the most likely arrangement avoids conflicts:  
   - If **N** is at position 5, **R** must be at position 4 (since position 5 is occupied), and **U** must be at position 3 (positions 4 and 5 taken).  
   - The word structure would be: `[?] [?] [U] [R] [N]`, with positions 1 and 2 filled by new, unused letters.

4. **Untested Letters**:  
   Focus on common unused consonants (e.g., B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P) and vowels (O is the most common untested vowel).

5. **Valid Word Candidates**:  
   Fitting `_ _ U R N` with discarded letters avoided (no C, A, E, T, S, I, G) yields words like **""MOURN""** (valid 5-letter word meaning to grieve).  
   - Positions: M(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), N(5).  
   - Satisfies all constraints: U at position 3 (new), R at position 4 (new), N at position 5 (new).

**Next Guess**: ""MOURN""  
- Tests R, U, N in untested positions (3, 4, 5).  
- Introduces new letters M and O for broader coverage.",Guess 4: mourn -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) O(✓) U(✓) R(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
