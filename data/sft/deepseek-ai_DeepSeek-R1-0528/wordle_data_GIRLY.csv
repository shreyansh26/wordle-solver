We are making the first guess. Since we have no previous feedback, we should choose a word that has common letters and maximizes information gain.
 Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).
 A good starting word might be one that includes several common letters and has no repeating letters to maximize coverage.

 Some popular starting words in Wordle are:
  - CRANE
  - SLATE
  - TRACE
  - ROAST
  - RAISE

 For our first guess, let's choose ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 So, the first guess is ""RAISE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
  R: - (meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position)
  A: x (A is not in the word)
  I: - (I is in the word but in the wrong position)
  S: x (S is not in the word)
  E: x (E is not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and I, but not in the positions they were in ""RAISE"". Specifically:
    R is not in the first position (since it was marked as wrong position, but present).
    I is not in the third position (same reason).
- The letters A, S, and E are absent from the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word has:
  - R and I, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively.
  - It does not contain A, S, or E.

We also know that the word is 5 letters long.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
  - Does not contain A, S, or E (since they are absent).
  - Includes R and I (to get more information about their positions) and possibly other common letters that we haven't tried yet.
  - Avoids placing R in position 1 and I in position 3.

We have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to test more letters and narrow down the positions.

Let's think of common letters that we haven't used: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that R and I must be in the word, so we should include them in the next guess, but in different positions.

Possible positions for R: since it can't be in position 1, it can be in 2, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, I can't be in position 3, so it can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We want to maximize the information we get. So, we can try to put R and I in positions that we haven't tested and also include other common letters.

Let's try to form a word that:
  - Has R and I (but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively)
  - Uses other common consonants and vowels (but note: we know the word doesn't have A, E, so vowels left are O, U, and sometimes Y).

But note: the word must be a valid English word.

One idea: put R in position 2 and I in position 4? Then we need to fill the other positions.

We also want to test other common letters. For example, T, N, O, L, etc.

Let's try to form a word:

Position 1: Cannot be R (because R was in position 1 and was wrong, but also we don't know if R can be in other positions). Actually, we can try R in a new position.

But note: we must avoid A, S, E.

Consider the word: ""TRIED"" -> but it has E (which is absent) and D. Also, E is not allowed. So skip.

Another: ""CRIMP"" -> but C is new, R in position 2, I in position 3? But wait, in the first guess, I was in position 3 and we got a '-' meaning I is in the word but not in that position. So we can try I in a different position. However, in ""CRIMP"", I is in position 3 again? That would be the same position, which we know is wrong. So we should avoid putting I in position 3 again.

So, let's avoid position 3 for I.

Similarly, avoid position 1 for R.

Try a word with R in position 2 and I in position 4.

Example: ""DRINK"" -> D, R, I, N, K. 
  - D, N, K are new.
  - R in position 2 (which is new for R) and I in position 4 (new for I).

But note: the word must not have A, S, E. ""DRINK"" doesn't have these, so it's okay.

Another possibility: ""BRING"" -> B, R, I, N, G. Also valid.

But we don't know if B, G, etc. are in the word.

Alternatively, we could try to use more new letters to cover more ground.

Another common starting approach is to use words with common letters. Since we know R and I are in the word, we can focus on finding their positions and also test other common letters.

Let me list some words that have R and I, and avoid A, S, E:

- POINT: P, O, I, N, T -> but I is in position 3? We must avoid position 3 for I? Actually, we can try I in position 3 again? But the feedback said I is in the word but not in position 3, so if we put I in position 3 again, we know it will be marked as wrong position (if the word has I) but we already know I is in the word. However, that doesn't give new information about the position. So it's better to try I in a new position.

So, avoid position 3 for I.

Similarly, avoid position 1 for R.

So, for I, we can try positions: 1, 2, 4, 5.

For R: 2, 3, 4, 5.

Now, let's try to form a word with I in position 1 and R in position 4? For example: ""IRONY"" -> I, R, O, N, Y. 
  - I in position 1 (new), R in position 2? Wait, in ""IRONY"", R is in position 2. But we want to avoid R in position 1, but position 2 is new.

Actually, in ""IRONY"": 
  Position 1: I
  Position 2: R
  Position 3: O
  Position 4: N
  Position 5: Y

This word: 
  - I is in position 1 (which we haven't tried before for I)
  - R is in position 2 (which we haven't tried for R, since previously R was in position 1)

Also, it uses O, N, Y which are new.

So, ""IRONY"" seems like a good candidate.

Another word: ""URBAN"" -> but has A (which is absent) and U, R, B, N. But A is not allowed, so skip.

""ORBIT"" -> O, R, B, I, T. 
  Positions: 
    1: O
    2: R (new for R)
    3: B
    4: I (new for I, since previously I was in position 3, now position 4)
    5: T

This also avoids A, S, E.

So, ""ORBIT"" is another candidate.

We could also consider ""DIRTY"" -> D, I, R, T, Y. 
  Positions: 
    1: D
    2: I (new for I, previously I was in position 3, now 2)
    3: R (new for R, previously R was in position 1, now 3)
    4: T
    5: Y

This also avoids the forbidden letters.

But note: we are not sure if D, T, Y are in the word, but that's the point of guessing.

We want to maximize the number of new letters we test. 

In ""IRONY"": letters I, R, O, N, Y -> all new except I and R (which we know are present, but we are testing new positions).
In ""ORBIT"": O, R, B, I, T -> same, all new except R and I.
In ""DIRTY"": D, I, R, T, Y -> same.

But note: we have only 5 letters, so we can test 5 new letters? Actually, we must include R and I because we know they are in the word. So we are testing 3 new letters (and two known: R and I).

We don't have to include R and I? Actually, we can, but if we don't, we might miss information about their positions. Since we know they are in the word, it's better to include them to get position information.

So, I think including R and I is a good idea.

Now, which word to choose? We can choose one that has common letters to get more hits.

Common consonants: T, N, L, etc.

""IRONY"" has N and Y (Y is less common). 
""ORBIT"" has B and T.
""DIRTY"" has D, T, Y.

Perhaps ""ORBIT"" is good because it has T which is very common.

Another word: ""PRINT"" -> P, R, I, N, T. 
  Positions: 
    1: P
    2: R (new for R)
    3: I -> but wait, we cannot put I in position 3 because we already know that position 3 is wrong for I? Actually, we can, but it will be marked as wrong position again (if the secret word's I is not in position 3). But we already know that, so it doesn't give new information. So we should avoid position 3 for I.

In ""PRINT"", I is in position 3 again. So we avoid that.

Similarly, we avoid position 1 for R.

So, let's choose between ""IRONY"", ""ORBIT"", and ""DIRTY"".

I think ""ORBIT"" is a good choice because:
  - It tests O (a vowel) and T (a common consonant) and B (less common, but that's okay).
  - Positions: R in position 2 (new) and I in position 4 (new).

Alternatively, ""DIRTY"" has I in position 2 (new) and R in position 3 (new). Also, T is common.

But ""ORBIT"" has the advantage of having a vowel (O) which might be present.

Since we don't have any vowels except I (and we know I is present) and the word must have at least one vowel? Actually, we don't know about others. The word might have O, U, or Y as a vowel.

We haven't tested O, U, or Y.

So, let's go with ""ORBIT"".

We can also consider ""ROBIN"" -> but has N, and I in position 5? 
  Positions: 
    1: R -> but we cannot put R in position 1? Actually, we can, but we know that position 1 is wrong for R (because in the first guess R was in position 1 and marked as wrong position). So if we put R in position 1 again, it will be marked as wrong position again (if the secret word's R is not in position 1). But we already know that, so it doesn't help. So we should avoid position 1 for R.

In ""ROBIN"", R is in position 1 again -> avoid.

Similarly, ""IRATE"" has E and A -> not allowed.

So, I think ""ORBIT"" is a solid choice.

Let me check if ""ORBIT"" is a valid word: yes, it means the curved path of a celestial object.

So, I'll go with ""ORBIT"".

But note: we have to avoid the letters A, S, E, and we are avoiding them.

Therefore, the second guess: ORBIT.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked as -).
- A is not in the secret word (marked as x).
- I is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked as -).
- S is not in the secret word (marked as x).
- E is not in the secret word (marked as x).

Key insights:
1. The secret word contains **R** and **I**, but neither is in their guessed positions (R not in position 1, I not in position 3).
2. The secret word **excludes A, S, and E**.
3. For the next guess:
   - Must include **R and I** to test new positions (avoiding position 1 for R and position 3 for I).
   - Should introduce new common letters (e.g., O, B, T) to gather more information.
   - Avoid letters A, S, E entirely.

The word **ORBIT** fits well:
- Places R in position 2 (new position for R).
- Places I in position 4 (new position for I).
- Tests new common letters: O (vowel), B, and T (common consonant).
- Valid 5-letter word that excludes A, S, E.

<guess>ORBIT</guess>",ORBIT,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":

  A: x (A is not in the word)

    R is not in the first position (since it was marked as wrong position, but present).

This also avoids A, S, E.

So, ""ORBIT"" is another candidate.

We could also consider ""DIRTY"" -> D, I, R, T, Y. 
  Positions: 
    1: D

Similarly, we avoid position 1 for R.

So, let's choose between ""IRONY"", ""ORBIT"", and ""DIRTY"".

I think ""ORBIT"" is a good choice because:
  - It tests O (a vowel) and T (a common consonant) and B (less common, but that's okay).
  - Positions: R in position 2 (new) and I in position 4 (new).

Alternatively, ""DIRTY"" has I in position 2 (new) and R in position 3 (new). Also, T is common.

But ""ORBIT"" has the advantage of having a vowel (O) which might be present.

Since we don't have any vowels except I (and we know I is present) and the word must have at least one vowel? Actually, we don't know about others. The word might have O, U, or Y as a vowel.

We haven't tested O, U, or Y.

So, let's go with ""ORBIT"".

We can also consider ""ROBIN"" -> but has N, and I in position 5? 
  Positions: 
    1: R -> but we cannot put R in position 1? Actually, we can, but we know that position 1 is wrong for R (because in the first guess R was in position 1 and marked as wrong position). So if we put R in position 1 again, it will be marked as wrong position again (if the secret word's R is not in position 1). But we already know that, so it doesn't help. So we should avoid position 1 for R.

In ""ROBIN"", R is in position 1 again -> avoid.

Similarly, ""IRATE"" has E and A -> not allowed.

So, I think ""ORBIT"" is a solid choice.

Let me check if ""ORBIT"" is a valid word: yes, it means the curved path of a celestial object.

So, I'll go with ""ORBIT"".

But note: we have to avoid the letters A, S, E, and we are avoiding them.

Therefore, the second guess: ORBIT.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked as -).
- A is not in the secret word (marked as x).
- I is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked as -).
- S is not in the secret word (marked as x).
- E is not in the secret word (marked as x).

Key insights:
1. The secret word contains **R** and **I**, but neither is in their guessed positions (R not in position 1, I not in position 3).
2. The secret word **excludes A, S, and E**.
3. For the next guess:
   - Must include **R and I** to test new positions (avoiding position 1 for R and position 3 for I).
   - Should introduce new common letters (e.g., O, B, T) to gather more information.
   - Avoid letters A, S, E entirely.

The word **ORBIT** fits well:
- Places R in position 2 (new position for R).
- Places I in position 4 (new position for I).
- Tests new common letters: O (vowel), B, and T (common consonant).
- Valid 5-letter word that excludes A, S, E.",Guess 2: ORBIT -> FEEDBACK: O(x) R(-) B(x) I(-) T(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no previous feedback, we should choose a word that has common letters and maximizes information gain.
 Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).
 A good starting word might be one that includes several common letters and has no repeating letters to maximize coverage.

 Some popular starting words in Wordle are:
  - CRANE
  - SLATE
  - TRACE
  - ROAST
  - RAISE

 For our first guess, let's choose ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 So, the first guess is ""RAISE"".For the first guess, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. I'll select a word with common letters (vowels and frequent consonants) without repeating letters to cover more possibilities. A word like ""RAISE"" includes common vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S), covering five distinct letters to help identify the secret word efficiently.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
  R: - (meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position)
  A: x (A is not in the word)
  I: - (I is in the word but in the wrong position)
  S: x (S is not in the word)
  E: x (E is not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and I, but not in the positions they were in ""RAISE"". Specifically:
    R is not in the first position (since it was marked as wrong position, but present).
    I is not in the third position (same reason).
- The letters A, S, and E are absent from the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word has:
  - R and I, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively.
  - It does not contain A, S, or E.

We also know that the word is 5 letters long.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
  - Does not contain A, S, or E (since they are absent).
  - Includes R and I (to get more information about their positions) and possibly other common letters that we haven't tried yet.
  - Avoids placing R in position 1 and I in position 3.

We have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to test more letters and narrow down the positions.

Let's think of common letters that we haven't used: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that R and I must be in the word, so we should include them in the next guess, but in different positions.

Possible positions for R: since it can't be in position 1, it can be in 2, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, I can't be in position 3, so it can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We want to maximize the information we get. So, we can try to put R and I in positions that we haven't tested and also include other common letters.

Let's try to form a word that:
  - Has R and I (but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively)
  - Uses other common consonants and vowels (but note: we know the word doesn't have A, E, so vowels left are O, U, and sometimes Y).

But note: the word must be a valid English word.

One idea: put R in position 2 and I in position 4? Then we need to fill the other positions.

We also want to test other common letters. For example, T, N, O, L, etc.

Let's try to form a word:

Position 1: Cannot be R (because R was in position 1 and was wrong, but also we don't know if R can be in other positions). Actually, we can try R in a new position.

But note: we must avoid A, S, E.

Consider the word: ""TRIED"" -> but it has E (which is absent) and D. Also, E is not allowed. So skip.

Another: ""CRIMP"" -> but C is new, R in position 2, I in position 3? But wait, in the first guess, I was in position 3 and we got a '-' meaning I is in the word but not in that position. So we can try I in a different position. However, in ""CRIMP"", I is in position 3 again? That would be the same position, which we know is wrong. So we should avoid putting I in position 3 again.

So, let's avoid position 3 for I.

Similarly, avoid position 1 for R.

Try a word with R in position 2 and I in position 4.

Example: ""DRINK"" -> D, R, I, N, K. 
  - D, N, K are new.
  - R in position 2 (which is new for R) and I in position 4 (new for I).

But note: the word must not have A, S, E. ""DRINK"" doesn't have these, so it's okay.

Another possibility: ""BRING"" -> B, R, I, N, G. Also valid.

But we don't know if B, G, etc. are in the word.

Alternatively, we could try to use more new letters to cover more ground.

Another common starting approach is to use words with common letters. Since we know R and I are in the word, we can focus on finding their positions and also test other common letters.

Let me list some words that have R and I, and avoid A, S, E:

- POINT: P, O, I, N, T -> but I is in position 3? We must avoid position 3 for I? Actually, we can try I in position 3 again? But the feedback said I is in the word but not in position 3, so if we put I in position 3 again, we know it will be marked as wrong position (if the word has I) but we already know I is in the word. However, that doesn't give new information about the position. So it's better to try I in a new position.

So, avoid position 3 for I.

Similarly, avoid position 1 for R.

So, for I, we can try positions: 1, 2, 4, 5.

For R: 2, 3, 4, 5.

Now, let's try to form a word with I in position 1 and R in position 4? For example: ""IRONY"" -> I, R, O, N, Y. 
  - I in position 1 (new), R in position 2? Wait, in ""IRONY"", R is in position 2. But we want to avoid R in position 1, but position 2 is new.

Actually, in ""IRONY"": 
  Position 1: I
  Position 2: R
  Position 3: O
  Position 4: N
  Position 5: Y

This word: 
  - I is in position 1 (which we haven't tried before for I)
  - R is in position 2 (which we haven't tried for R, since previously R was in position 1)

Also, it uses O, N, Y which are new.

So, ""IRONY"" seems like a good candidate.

Another word: ""URBAN"" -> but has A (which is absent) and U, R, B, N. But A is not allowed, so skip.

""ORBIT"" -> O, R, B, I, T. 
  Positions: 
    1: O
    2: R (new for R)
    3: B
    4: I (new for I, since previously I was in position 3, now position 4)
    5: T

This also avoids A, S, E.

So, ""ORBIT"" is another candidate.

We could also consider ""DIRTY"" -> D, I, R, T, Y. 
  Positions: 
    1: D
    2: I (new for I, previously I was in position 3, now 2)
    3: R (new for R, previously R was in position 1, now 3)
    4: T
    5: Y

This also avoids the forbidden letters.

But note: we are not sure if D, T, Y are in the word, but that's the point of guessing.

We want to maximize the number of new letters we test. 

In ""IRONY"": letters I, R, O, N, Y -> all new except I and R (which we know are present, but we are testing new positions).
In ""ORBIT"": O, R, B, I, T -> same, all new except R and I.
In ""DIRTY"": D, I, R, T, Y -> same.

But note: we have only 5 letters, so we can test 5 new letters? Actually, we must include R and I because we know they are in the word. So we are testing 3 new letters (and two known: R and I).

We don't have to include R and I? Actually, we can, but if we don't, we might miss information about their positions. Since we know they are in the word, it's better to include them to get position information.

So, I think including R and I is a good idea.

Now, which word to choose? We can choose one that has common letters to get more hits.

Common consonants: T, N, L, etc.

""IRONY"" has N and Y (Y is less common). 
""ORBIT"" has B and T.
""DIRTY"" has D, T, Y.

Perhaps ""ORBIT"" is good because it has T which is very common.

Another word: ""PRINT"" -> P, R, I, N, T. 
  Positions: 
    1: P
    2: R (new for R)
    3: I -> but wait, we cannot put I in position 3 because we already know that position 3 is wrong for I? Actually, we can, but it will be marked as wrong position again (if the secret word's I is not in position 3). But we already know that, so it doesn't give new information. So we should avoid position 3 for I.

In ""PRINT"", I is in position 3 again. So we avoid that.

Similarly, we avoid position 1 for R.

So, let's choose between ""IRONY"", ""ORBIT"", and ""DIRTY"".

I think ""ORBIT"" is a good choice because:
  - It tests O (a vowel) and T (a common consonant) and B (less common, but that's okay).
  - Positions: R in position 2 (new) and I in position 4 (new).

Alternatively, ""DIRTY"" has I in position 2 (new) and R in position 3 (new). Also, T is common.

But ""ORBIT"" has the advantage of having a vowel (O) which might be present.

Since we don't have any vowels except I (and we know I is present) and the word must have at least one vowel? Actually, we don't know about others. The word might have O, U, or Y as a vowel.

We haven't tested O, U, or Y.

So, let's go with ""ORBIT"".

We can also consider ""ROBIN"" -> but has N, and I in position 5? 
  Positions: 
    1: R -> but we cannot put R in position 1? Actually, we can, but we know that position 1 is wrong for R (because in the first guess R was in position 1 and marked as wrong position). So if we put R in position 1 again, it will be marked as wrong position again (if the secret word's R is not in position 1). But we already know that, so it doesn't help. So we should avoid position 1 for R.

In ""ROBIN"", R is in position 1 again -> avoid.

Similarly, ""IRATE"" has E and A -> not allowed.

So, I think ""ORBIT"" is a solid choice.

Let me check if ""ORBIT"" is a valid word: yes, it means the curved path of a celestial object.

So, I'll go with ""ORBIT"".

But note: we have to avoid the letters A, S, E, and we are avoiding them.

Therefore, the second guess: ORBIT.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked as -).
- A is not in the secret word (marked as x).
- I is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked as -).
- S is not in the secret word (marked as x).
- E is not in the secret word (marked as x).

Key insights:
1. The secret word contains **R** and **I**, but neither is in their guessed positions (R not in position 1, I not in position 3).
2. The secret word **excludes A, S, and E**.
3. For the next guess:
   - Must include **R and I** to test new positions (avoiding position 1 for R and position 3 for I).
   - Should introduce new common letters (e.g., O, B, T) to gather more information.
   - Avoid letters A, S, E entirely.

The word **ORBIT** fits well:
- Places R in position 2 (new position for R).
- Places I in position 4 (new position for I).
- Tests new common letters: O (vowel), B, and T (common consonant).
- Valid 5-letter word that excludes A, S, E.

So if we put R in position 1 again, it will be marked as wrong position again (if the secret word\'s R is not in position 1). But we already know that, so it doesn\'t help.

We have two sets of feedback:

From Guess 1 (RAISE):
- R: present but not in position 1 (so R is in the word, but not at index 0)
- A: absent
- I: present but not in position 3 (so I is in the word, but not at index 2)
- S: absent
- E: absent

From Guess 2 (ORBIT):
- O: absent
- R: present but not in position 2 (so R is in the word, but not at index 1)
- B: absent
- I: present but not in position 4 (so I is in the word, but not at index 3)
- T: absent

What we know so far:
- The secret word contains R and I, but we have ruled out positions for them:
  - R cannot be in position 0 (from RAISE) or position 1 (from ORBIT). So R must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
  - I cannot be in position 2 (from RAISE) or position 3 (from ORBIT). So I must be in position 0, 1, or 4.
- The secret word does not contain: A, S, E, O, B, T.

We also know the word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

We need to choose a new guess that:
- Includes R and I (since they are in the word) and places them in the remaining possible positions.
- Avoids the letters we know are absent: A, S, E, O, B, T.
- Tries to cover new common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for R: [2, 3, 4]
Possible positions for I: [0, 1, 4]

But note: if we put I in position 4, then R cannot be in position 4? Actually, they can be in the same position? No, because each letter position is independent. However, if both are to be placed in position 4, that would be the same letter? But we have two distinct letters. So R and I must be in different positions.

Therefore, we have to assign R and I to two distinct positions from the available ones.

We can try to form a word that has:
- I in position 0 or 1 (since position 4 is also available for I, but we might avoid it for now to test other positions) and R in one of 2,3,4.

We also need to choose three other letters that are not in the absent list.

Absent letters: A, S, E, O, B, T.

So available letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should choose common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters: perhaps L, N, U, C, D, P, etc.

Let's try to form a word:

Option 1: Place I in position 0 and R in position 2.
Then the word would be: I _ R _ _

We need to fill the blanks with letters not in the absent set.

For example: I _ R _ _ -> we can try ""I"" at 0, then for position 1: try a common letter, say N. Then position 3 and 4: we need two more letters.

But we also have to consider that R is in position 2, which is one of the allowed positions.

Example: ""INRUN""? But ""RUN"" has U and N, but ""INRUN"" is 5 letters? No, that's 5: I-N-R-U-N. But is that a word? Not really. 

Another: ""INFER"" -> but E is absent. Not allowed.

""INCUR"" -> has U and R. But R is already in position 2? And we are putting R at the end? Wait, no: the word would be I-N-C-U-R? Then R is at position 4. But we are trying to put R at position 2? 

Let me clarify: if we want R at position 2, then the third letter must be R.

So: I _ R _ _

We need to choose letters for positions 1, 3, and 4.

Possible word: ""DIRTY"" but D is allowed, but T is absent? From guess2, T is absent. So we cannot use T.

Another: ""PIRNS""? Not a common word.

Option 2: Place I in position 1 and R in position 2.

Then the word: _ I R _ _

We can try: ""FIRED"" -> but E is absent.

""GIRLY"" -> G, I, R, L, Y. 
- G is allowed, L is allowed, Y is allowed.
- But we have I at position 1 and R at position 2.

Is ""GIRLY"" a word? Yes, meaning like a girl.

But note: we have to check if the positions for I and R are allowed. 
- I is at position 1: which is allowed (since we haven't tried I at 1 before, and it's one of the possible positions).
- R is at position 2: which is allowed? Wait, from ORBIT, R was at position 1 and we got R(-) meaning R is not at position 1. But now we are putting R at position 2. Is that allowed? Yes, because we haven't tested R at position 2. Actually, in ORBIT, R was at position 1, so position 2 is new.

But wait: in the feedback for ORBIT, R was marked as present but not in position 1. That doesn't say anything about position 2. So we can try R at position 2.

Similarly, I is at position 1: we haven't tried I at position 1 before (in RAISE, I was at position 2? Actually, in RAISE: positions are 0:R, 1:A, 2:I, 3:S, 4:E. So I was at position 2. Then in ORBIT, I was at position 3. Now we are trying I at position 1.

So ""GIRLY"" seems possible.

But we must avoid the absent letters: A, S, E, O, B, T. ""GIRLY"" has G, I, R, L, Y. None of the absent letters. So it's okay.

Option 3: Place I in position 4 and R in position 2.

Then the word: _ _ R _ I

Example: ""CURRY"" -> but has two R's? And U is allowed, but we have R at position 2 and then R again at position 3? But the secret word might have two R's? We don't know. But in our feedback, we only know that R is present, but not how many times. So it could be multiple.

But ""CURRY"" has two R's. Also, C and U are allowed. But we have I at the end? No, we are putting I at position 4? In ""CURRY"", the last letter is Y, not I.

So we need a word that ends with I and has R at position 2.

Example: ""LARRI""? Not a word.

""MERRI"" -> but E is absent.

""PURRI"" -> not a word.

This might be difficult.

Option 4: Place I in position 0 and R in position 3.

Word: I _ _ R _

Example: ""INCUR"" -> I, N, C, U, R -> then R is at position 4, not 3.

We need R at position 3: so I _ _ R _

Example: ""INNER"" -> E absent.

""IDLER"" -> E absent.

""IMPUR"" -> not a word.

""INJUR"" -> not a word.

Option 5: Place I in position 0 and R in position 4.

Word: I _ _ _ R

Example: ""INTER"" -> E and T absent.

""INVAR"" -> A absent.

""INDEX"" -> E absent.

This is getting hard.

Option 6: Place I in position 1 and R in position 3.

Word: _ I _ R _

Example: ""HIRER"" -> E absent.

""FILMR"" -> not a word.

""MINOR"" -> O absent.

""PILAR"" -> A absent.

""WIDER"" -> E absent.

But we can try: ""CIGAR"" -> A absent.

Not working.

Option 7: Place I in position 1 and R in position 4.

Word: _ I _ _ R

Example: ""TIGER"" -> T absent.

""LINER"" -> E absent.

""MINOR"" -> O absent.

""VICAR"" -> A absent.

Still not.

Option 8: Place I in position 4 and R in position 3.

Word: _ _ _ R I

Example: ""CURTI"" -> not a word.

""PURSI"" -> not a word.

""LARVI"" -> not a word.

This is difficult.

Option 9: Place I in position 4 and R in position 2.

We tried that.

Alternatively, we might consider that R and I could be in the same word in the positions we haven't tried, but we need a valid word.

Given the difficulty, let's go back to the ""GIRLY"" option: which has I at position 1 and R at position 2.

But we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't have evidence for that yet.

Another idea: we know that R must be in one of positions 2,3,4 and I in 0,1,4. We can try a word that tests R at position 3 and I at position 1, for example.

But we need a word that fits.

Let me try to list possible words:

- ""LIRCH"" -> not a word.

- ""MIRTH"" -> M, I, R, T, H -> but T is absent (from ORBIT feedback: T is absent). So we cannot use T.

- ""FIRTH"" -> T absent.

- ""GIRTH"" -> T absent.

Without T, it's harder.

What about ""GIRLY""? We thought of that.

Another word: ""CIRRI"" -> but that has two I's and two R's? And it ends with I. But let's see: C, I, R, R, I. 
- I at position 1? Actually, positions: 0:C, 1:I, 2:R, 3:R, 4:I. 
But we are trying to put R at position 2 and 3? And I at 1 and 4? 
But we don't know if the word has duplicates. 
However, ""CIRRI"" is a word (plural of cirrus). 
But we have to avoid absent letters: C is allowed, I and R are in the word, but we are using them. 
But the feedback might be confusing because of duplicates.

Alternatively, we can try ""WIRRA"" -> but A is absent.

Perhaps ""GIRLY"" is a better choice because it uses common letters and is a familiar word.

Another common word: ""THIRL"" -> but T is absent.

""SHIRK"" -> S is absent.

""WHIRL"" -> but H, W, L are allowed? But we have to avoid S, T, etc. ""WHIRL"" has W, H, I, R, L. 
- I at position 2? We want to try I at a new position. 
In ""WHIRL"": 
  position 0: W
  position 1: H
  position 2: I
  position 3: R
  position 4: L

But we have I at position 2: but from RAISE, we know that I is in the word but not at position 2. So we cannot put I at position 2 again because it will be marked as wrong position (and we already know that). So it doesn't give new information.

Therefore, we must avoid position 2 for I.

Similarly, we must avoid position 3 for I (from ORBIT feedback).

So I can only be at 0, 1, or 4.

In ""WHIRL"", I is at position 2 -> not allowed.

So we cannot use that.

Back to ""GIRLY"": 
  position 0: G
  position 1: I -> allowed (new position for I)
  position 2: R -> allowed (new position for R, since we haven't tried R at 2)
  position 3: L
  position 4: Y

And it avoids the forbidden letters.

Another possibility: ""DIRGE"" -> but E is absent.

""FIRED"" -> E absent.

""BIRCH"" -> B is absent.

""PINKY"" -> but no R? We must include R.

We must include both R and I.

So ""GIRLY"" seems good.

We can also consider ""MIRKY"" -> M, I, R, K, Y. 
  I at 1, R at 2. 
  Avoids absent letters.

But ""MIRKY"" is a word (dark and gloomy).

Similarly, ""GIRLY"" and ""MIRKY"" are both options.

But ""GIRLY"" uses L, which is more common than K? But we are testing letters.

We can choose either.

Another: ""WIRY"" is 4 letters, not 5.

""JIVERY""? Not common.

I think ""GIRLY"" is a reasonable choice.

But let's see if there is a word that tests more vowels? We know O is absent, so the only vowel left is U, and sometimes Y. We have Y in ""GIRLY"".

We could try a word with U.

For example, ""CURVY"" but no I or R in the required positions.

We need to include I and R.

""QUIRK"" -> Q, U, I, R, K. 
  Positions: 
    0: Q
    1: U
    2: I -> but I cannot be at position 2 (from RAISE feedback: I is not at position 2). So we avoid.

""QUIRK"" has I at 2 -> invalid.

""UNRID"" -> not a word.

""URPED"" -> not a word.

So, I think ""GIRLY"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""GIRLY"".

But note: we are also testing G, L, Y. If any of these are in the word, we get feedback.

So the next guess: GIRLY.

But let's double-check the positions for I and R:
- I is at position 1: which is a new position (previously tried at 2 and 3, now 1).
- R is at position 2: which is a new position (previously tried at 0 and 1, now 2).

And we avoid the absent letters.

So, <guess>GIRLY</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first two guesses:

- **RAISE**: R is in the word but not in position 1, I is in the word but not in position 3, and A, S, E are absent.
- **ORBIT**: R is in the word but not in position 2, I is in the word but not in position 4, and O, B, T are absent.

Key insights:
1. **R and I are confirmed in the word**, but their positions are constrained:
   - R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from RAISE and ORBIT), so it must be in position 3 or 4.
   - I cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from RAISE and ORBIT), so it must be in position 0, 1, or 4.
2. **Absent letters**: A, S, E, O, B, T (cannot be used).
3. **Available letters**: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the next guess:
- Must include **R and I** to test new valid positions.
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., L, N, Y) to maximize information.
- Avoid positions ruled out for R and I.

Chose **GIRLY** because:
- Places I in position 1 (a new valid position for I).
- Places R in position 2 (a new valid position for R, as R must be in 3 or 4, but position 2 is untested and now tested to check if R could be here).
- Uses new common letters: G, L, Y (all not previously tested).
- Avoids all absent letters.
- Valid 5-letter word (meaning ""resembling a girl"" or ""youthful"").

This guess efficiently tests R and I in new positions while probing three additional letters.

For example, ""CURVY"" but no I or R in the required positions.

We need to include I and R.

""QUIRK"" -> Q, U, I, R, K. 
  Positions: 
    0: Q
    1: U
    2: I -> but I cannot be at position 2 (from RAISE feedback: I is not at position 2). So we avoid.

""QUIRK"" has I at 2 -> invalid.

""UNRID"" -> not a word.

""URPED"" -> not a word.

So, I think ""GIRLY"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""GIRLY"".

But note: we are also testing G, L, Y. If any of these are in the word, we get feedback.

So the next guess: GIRLY.

But let's double-check the positions for I and R:
- I is at position 1: which is a new position (previously tried at 2 and 3, now 1).
- R is at position 2: which is a new position (previously tried at 0 and 1, now 2).

And we avoid the absent letters.

So, <guess>GIRLY</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first two guesses:

- **RAISE**: R is in the word but not in position 1, I is in the word but not in position 3, and A, S, E are absent.
- **ORBIT**: R is in the word but not in position 2, I is in the word but not in position 4, and O, B, T are absent.

Key insights:
1. **R and I are confirmed in the word**, but their positions are constrained:
   - R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from RAISE and ORBIT), so it must be in position 3 or 4.
   - I cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from RAISE and ORBIT), so it must be in position 0, 1, or 4.
2. **Absent letters**: A, S, E, O, B, T (cannot be used).
3. **Available letters**: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the next guess:
- Must include **R and I** to test new valid positions.
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., L, N, Y) to maximize information.
- Avoid positions ruled out for R and I.

Chose **GIRLY** because:
- Places I in position 1 (a new valid position for I).
- Places R in position 2 (a new valid position for R, as R must be in 3 or 4, but position 2 is untested and now tested to check if R could be here).
- Uses new common letters: G, L, Y (all not previously tested).
- Avoids all absent letters.
- Valid 5-letter word (meaning ""resembling a girl"" or ""youthful"").

This guess efficiently tests R and I in new positions while probing three additional letters.",Guess 3: GIRLY -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) I(✓) R(✓) L(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
