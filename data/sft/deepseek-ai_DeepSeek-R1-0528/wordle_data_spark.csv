Okay, the user wants to play a word-sleuth game similar to Wordle, and it's their first guess. Since this is the initial move with zero prior feedback, I need to pick a strategic starting word. 

Five-letter words with diverse common letters seem optimal for maximizing information. Words like ""CRANE"" cover frequent consonants and vowels - C,R,A,N,E. Alternatives like ""SLATE"" add S/L/T but skip R. 

Considering alphabet distribution, vowels A/E appear crucial, and consonants like S/T/R/N are statistically common in English. ""CRANE"" effectively spreads across these without repeating letters - critical since duplicates waste guess potential. 

The feedback mapping will be key: position matches (✓), misplaced letters (-), and absent ones (x). This first guess aims to test multiple high-frequency letters at once to narrow possibilities faster. 

No need to overcomplicate - ""CRANE"" strikes balance between commonness and letter spread. Let's lock that in.

We'll go step-by-step based on the feedback we received:

From Guess 1: CRANE → C(x), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(x)

Feedback interpretation:
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since A is the third letter? Wait, let's count: C-R-A-N-E → positions: 1-C, 2-R, 3-A, 4-N, 5-E). So A is at position 3? Actually, let me write it clearly:

Position 1: C → x (not in word)
Position 2: R → - (in word but wrong position)
Position 3: A → ✓ (correct position)
Position 5: E → x (not in word)

Wait, but the word is 5 letters: so positions 1 to 5:

1: C → not in word
2: R → in word but wrong position
3: A → correct position
4: N → not in word
5: E → not in word

So we know:
- The word has an A in the third position: _ _ A _ _
- The word has an R, but not at position 2. So R must be at position 1, 4, or 5? Actually, it could be in any position except 2. So possible positions for R: 1, 4, or 5? But note the third is A, so position 4 and 5 are available? Actually, positions 1, 4 or 5? Wait, position 1 is available too? Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Position 3 is taken by A? Correct? So yes, positions 1,4,5 are available for R? Actually, position 3 is A so R can be at 1,4, or 5? But note position 2 is excluded? Actually, we know R is not at position 2, but it can be elsewhere? Actually, we know R is in the word? Yes, because ""-"" means it's in the word but wrong position? Correct? So R is somewhere else? But we know position 3 is A? So R cannot be at 3? So R must be at 1,4, or 5? But also, we know that positions 1,4,5 are not excluded? Actually we don't know? Only for position 2 we rejected? So indeed, R is at position 1,4, or 5.

Also, we know that C, E, N are not in the word at all? Correct? Because x? So the word does not contain C, E, N at all? Yes? So letters to avoid: C, E, N.

So secret word must:
- Have R somewhere? Correct? But wait: the feedback R(-) means that R is in the word? Yes? So R is present? So yes.

Now, since A is at position 3: _ _ A _ _

And the word must contain R (but not at position 2? Actually, it can be at position 1? If R is at position 1, then we have R ? A ? ? 

Or at position 4: ? ? A R ?

Or at position 5: ? ? A ? R

And the word also must not have C, E, or N? So letters excluded? So we can't use C,E,N.

Also, the letters we have? We have R and A? And we don't know about others? So what letters are possible?

We need to choose a new word that does not use C,E,N? And has R? But wait, we haven't checked other common letters? So we might want to try more common consonants? Or another vowel? Since A is positioned? So let's look for vowels? We haven't tried other vowels? Well E is excluded? So vowels: A is known? So perhaps we try I, O, U? Or sometimes Y? But we don't know about those.

Also, from the excluded letters: C, E, N? So we must avoid these.

We know R is somewhere? So let's make sure R is in our next guess? But it could be at different positions? So we should consider the different cases? Actually, for the next word, we want to try to place R at one of the possible positions (1,4,5) and see what happens? Or we can try multiple positions? Actually, no, since we have one guess? We want to gain information.

Perhaps try a word that has R at position 1? Then if R is actually at position 1, it will be ✓? Or if R is at position 4 or 5, then if we put R at position 1 and the word has R at another position, we will get ""-"" for R? Because it's present but in wrong position? Also, we must consider other letters? So we should avoid C,E,N? And use letters that are common? Because we don't know about others? Also, we must not put A at position 3? We know A is at position 3? So in our next word, we can put A at position 3? Actually, we should! Because A is known at position 3? So we can use that? So the next word should also have A at position 3? Because if we change, it will be wrong? But we know it's fixed? So we want to confirm that? Actually, the feedback already told A is in the correct position? So we can keep A at that position? So that we don't need to guess again? Yes?

So our next word must:
- Have A at position 3: _ _ A _ _
- Contain R? And we want to test where R is?
- Avoid using C, E, N? Because they are excluded?
- We also want to test other letters? So include other common letters? That haven't been used? But CRANE used C,R,A,N,E? So we excluded C,N,E? So letters not used? So we have: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But many options? So we should use common letters? So let me take: S, T, O, P, L? Actually, try S and T? Or S and H? Etc.

But also, we need to have R? So we must include R? So our word: must be 5 letters, with third letter A? And contain R? And no C,E,N? And we can try R at different positions? So let's think of words that fit:

Pattern: 

Two letters: we can pick? Then A? Then two letters? 

But R can be at position 1,4,5? So:

Case 1: R at position 1: R ? A ? ?
Case 2: R at position 4: ? ? A R ?
Case 3: R at position 5: ? ? A ? R

Now, our word should test as many possibilities as possible? So perhaps we can choose a word that tests letters at position 1? Or 4? Or 5? So let me consider common words? Also, we need to include new letters? So we haven't tested: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But exclude C,E,N? And R is included? So we have 4 more letters? R is already in? And then other positions?

Our word: position 3 is A: so we need to pick letters for positions 1,2,4,5? And we must include R?

Possible words:

For example, let me put R at position 1? Then: R _ A _ _

But? We must avoid C,E,N? So let's see: common words? Like RAT? But RAT is 3 letters? We need 5 letters? So R?A?S? But R? A? T? S? Words that start with RA?

RAILS? But S is allowed? But position 3 is I? We need position 3 A? So not RAILS? Because position 2 A? Wait, our pattern: position 1 R, position 2 ?, position 3 A, position 4 ?, position 5 ?

So RA?S? or something? What words start with R?A? But then A is at position 2? Then position 3 must be something else? How? We have A fixed at position 3.

So words starting with R? Then anything? Position 2: ?, position 3: A, then ? ?

So R? A???

For example: R--A-- ?

Like: RABID? B I D? But we haven't tested? Also, B and D allowed? Not excluded? Also, E and N excluded? So RABID: R A B I D? Position: 1-R, 2-A? Wait, position 2 A? But our pattern needs A at position 3? So not? Actually, we have A at position 3? So RABID: position 1 R, position 2 A? Then position 3 B? But we want position 3 to be A? So no? We need A at position 3? So the letter at position 2 is not A? So for R_ A__: we need letter at position 2 arbitrary? So many possibilities? Like: ROAST? Then we have O at position 2? And A at position 3? Then ST? But Roast: position 1 R,2 O,3 A? Then ST: position 4 S, position 5 T? So ROAST: R O A S T? Then position 3 A? Yes? And avoids C,E,N? So this? Then we test R at position 1? If R at position 1 is correct? And others?

Also, ROAST includes O,S,T? Which are common.

But what if R is at position 4? Then we have ROAST? R at position 1, which is not where R should be? Then R(-) but O? We don't know? But if R is actually at position 4? Then we would expect: R at position 1: since the word has R? But not at position 1? Then R would get ""-""? And O? We don't know? But we would know O? S? T?

Similarly? Also, if R at position 5? Then same? R(-) at position 1? And then we know S,T,O? Etc.

Another word: we can try R at position 5? So ? ? A ? R? Then for example: words ending with R? Avoid E,N? So? Like SUGAR? But G? Position: S U G A R? Position 3 G? Then 4 A? But we want A at position 3? So? We need A at position 3? So SUGAR? Position: 1 S,2 U,3 G,4 A,5 R? So not? We need A at position 3? So in SUGAR? Position 4 A? No? So we need a word with A at third? Then ends with R? So ? ? A ? R? So the fourth letter arbitrary? Then R at fifth?

For example: words: SOLAR? Position: S O L A R? Position 4 A? Position 3 L? So not? No? We want A at position 3? So SOLAR: position 3 L? So no? We need position 3 A? So ? ? A ? R? So the word ends with two letters? Then R at fifth? And fourth letter arbitrary? For example: TABOR? T A B O R? Position 3 B? Also no? MANOR? M A N? But N excluded? No? We avoid N? So MANOR has N? Even worse? Also, BAR?B? R? Big problem? How to find a word? Like: RADAR? Position 1 R,2 A,3 D,4 A,5 R? So position 3 D? Not A? We want A at position 3? Only at 3? So RADAR has A at 2 and 4? So not.

So ? ? A ?? R? With A at position 3? So the word must have third letter A? And fifth letter R? So two letters at position 1 and 2? Then A? Then? Then R? So position 4 arbitrary? Then R at 5? So _ _ A _ R? 

What words? Like LAR? Something? But no? Words: GEAR? But position 3 G? Not A? GUARD? Position 3 U? BOARD? Position 3 O? 

Actually, I'm struggling? Perhaps words that start with consonants? Then vowel? Then A? Then ? R? For example: STA?R? But STAR is 4? START? Position 1 S,2 T,3 A,4 R,5 T? So START: S T A R T? Position 4 R? Then we have position 5 T? Oh! So START: S T A R T? Third letter A? So it fits? And ends? But R is at position 4? Not 5? So START: positions: 1:S,2:T,3:A,4:R,5:T? So R is at position 4? Then we are testing R at position 4? Which is one possible? Because R could be at 4? Then START uses S,T,R,T? And avoids C,E,N? Also, T is repeated? But we don't know? Actually, START has two T? Also, S is new?

Another word: STARK? Similarly? Or STAFF? R? 

So START? Can we? But we also test S at position 1? T at position 2? And when we know R could be at 1,4,5? But if we use START? S T A R T? Then we are testing: 
- If R is at position 4, then R will get ✓? 
- If it's at position 1? Then it will be (-) because we have R at position 4? Actually, no? The secret word has only one R? Or multiple? We don't know? But maybe? Suppose the secret word has R? But we don't know if only one? So we must design for single? Or multiple? 

But similarly? 

Anyway? 

Back to ROAST? R O A S T? Position 1: R, 2: O, 3: A, 4: S, 5: T? Avoids C,E,N? 

So we can try ROAST? If we choose this? 

Another common word? Like SALAD? But D? And L? Avoid? SALAD: S A L A D? Position 3 L? And we have two A? But position not? We need position 3 A? So SALAD: position 3 L? So not? So not good? 

So ROAST seems good? 

But wait? O? Is O common? And S,T? 

Alternatively? TRAIN? But N excluded? TRAIN? N at the end? Which we exclude? So we must avoid N? So TRAIN? Cannot? 

Another? STAIN? Also N? Avoid? 

BRAIN? Similarly N? Avoid? 

So ROAST? Seems valid? 

Also? We can consider TAR?D? Etc? But ROAST is common? 

So let me choose ROAST? 

In this word? We have:
- R at position 1: which may be correct? Or wrong? 
- O at position 2: we don't know about O?
- A at position 3: which must be ✓? As already known?
- S at position 4: test if S is in the word?
- T at position 5: test if T is in the word?

And if R is at position 4? Then R at position 1 will be (-) because present? And S? Etc? 

Similarly? 

So we get information about R? And about O,S,T? 

Also? Consider if we choose a word with R at position? Different from 2? But also? The possibility that R is at 4 or 5? 

But ROAST will test R at position 1? Which covers one possibility? 

Alternatively? We can choose a word that doesn't put R at 1? But what for? 

For example? Suppose R is at position 5? Then we might test different? But unknown? 

But ROAST seems reasonable? 

Also? We want to use common letters? O,S,T are common? 

Hence? Guess ROAST? 

But wait? In CRANE? We had R(-)? So R is present? But at wrong position? So if we put R at position 1? And if the actual R is at 1? Then ROAST first R: ✓? Or if R is at 5? Then we will see R at 1: (-) ? 

Similarly? 

One more point: The word ROAST? Does it contain any excluded? C,E,N? No? So good? 

So I think ROAST is fine? 

Another word: PLAN?T? Avoid N? So any word without C,E,N? And has A at 3? 

But ROAST? Yes? 

So in summary? Our next word: ROAST? 

<guess>ROAST</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C**, **N**, and **E** are not in the word (marked with ❌).
- **A** is in the correct position (position 3, marked with ✓).
- **R** is in the word but in the wrong position (marked with ➖, so it cannot be at position 2).

We know:
- The secret word has **A** at position 3: `_ _ A _ _`.
- **R** is present but not at position 2, so it must be at position 1, 4, or 5.
- The word cannot contain **C**, **E**, or **N**.

For the next guess:
- We want to keep **A** at position 3 to maintain the known correct letter.
- To test the position of **R**, place it at position 1 to potentially gain immediate clarity if it is correct (✓) or to rule out that position if it gets ➖.
- Test new common letters (like **O**, **S**, **T**) to cover more ground on unprobed letters.
- Avoid using **C**, **E**, **N** as they are confirmed absent.

A suitable word that fits these criteria is **ROAST**:
- Position 3: **A** (confirmed correct).
- Position 1: **R** (tests if **R** is at position 1).
- Positions 2, 4, and 5: **O**, **S**, **T** — new letters not previously tested, all common and likely to provide useful feedback.

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for **R** ('s position and explores three additional letters.

<guess>ROAST</guess>",ROAST,"We'll go step-by-step based on the feedback we received:

From Guess 1: CRANE → C(x), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(x)

Feedback interpretation:
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since A is the third letter? Wait, let's count: C-R-A-N-E → positions: 1-C, 2-R, 3-A, 4-N, 5-E). So A is at position 3? Actually, let me write it clearly:

Position 1: C → x (not in word)
Position 2: R → - (in word but wrong position)
Position 3: A → ✓ (correct position)
Position 5: E → x (not in word)

Wait, but the word is 5 letters: so positions 1 to 5:

1: C → not in word
2: R → in word but wrong position
3: A → correct position
4: N → not in word
5: E → not in word

So we know:
- The word has an A in the third position: _ _ A _ _
- The word has an R, but not at position 2. So R must be at position 1, 4, or 5? Actually, it could be in any position except 2. So possible positions for R: 1, 4, or 5? But note the third is A, so position 4 and 5 are available? Actually, positions 1, 4 or 5? Wait, position 1 is available too? Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Position 3 is taken by A? Correct? So yes, positions 1,4,5 are available for R? Actually, position 3 is A so R can be at 1,4, or 5? But note position 2 is excluded? Actually, we know R is not at position 2, but it can be elsewhere? Actually, we know R is in the word? Yes, because ""-"" means it's in the word but wrong position? Correct? So R is somewhere else? But we know position 3 is A? So R cannot be at 3? So R must be at 1,4, or 5? But also, we know that positions 1,4,5 are not excluded? Actually we don't know? Only for position 2 we rejected? So indeed, R is at position 1,4, or 5.

Also, we know that C, E, N are not in the word at all? Correct? Because x? So the word does not contain C, E, N at all? Yes? So letters to avoid: C, E, N.

So secret word must:
- Have R somewhere? Correct? But wait: the feedback R(-) means that R is in the word? Yes? So R is present? So yes.

Now, since A is at position 3: _ _ A _ _

And the word must contain R (but not at position 2? Actually, it can be at position 1? If R is at position 1, then we have R ? A ? ? 

Or at position 4: ? ? A R ?

Or at position 5: ? ? A ? R

And the word also must not have C, E, or N? So letters excluded? So we can't use C,E,N.

Also, the letters we have? We have R and A? And we don't know about others? So what letters are possible?

We need to choose a new word that does not use C,E,N? And has R? But wait, we haven't checked other common letters? So we might want to try more common consonants? Or another vowel? Since A is positioned? So let's look for vowels? We haven't tried other vowels? Well E is excluded? So vowels: A is known? So perhaps we try I, O, U? Or sometimes Y? But we don't know about those.

Also, from the excluded letters: C, E, N? So we must avoid these.

We know R is somewhere? So let's make sure R is in our next guess? But it could be at different positions? So we should consider the different cases? Actually, for the next word, we want to try to place R at one of the possible positions (1,4,5) and see what happens? Or we can try multiple positions? Actually, no, since we have one guess? We want to gain information.

Perhaps try a word that has R at position 1? Then if R is actually at position 1, it will be ✓? Or if R is at position 4 or 5, then if we put R at position 1 and the word has R at another position, we will get ""-"" for R? Because it's present but in wrong position? Also, we must consider other letters? So we should avoid C,E,N? And use letters that are common? Because we don't know about others? Also, we must not put A at position 3? We know A is at position 3? So in our next word, we can put A at position 3? Actually, we should! Because A is known at position 3? So we can use that? So the next word should also have A at position 3? Because if we change, it will be wrong? But we know it's fixed? So we want to confirm that? Actually, the feedback already told A is in the correct position? So we can keep A at that position? So that we don't need to guess again? Yes?

So our next word must:
- Have A at position 3: _ _ A _ _
- Contain R? And we want to test where R is?
- Avoid using C, E, N? Because they are excluded?
- We also want to test other letters? So include other common letters? That haven't been used? But CRANE used C,R,A,N,E? So we excluded C,N,E? So letters not used? So we have: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But many options? So we should use common letters? So let me take: S, T, O, P, L? Actually, try S and T? Or S and H? Etc.

But also, we need to have R? So we must include R? So our word: must be 5 letters, with third letter A? And contain R? And no C,E,N? And we can try R at different positions? So let's think of words that fit:

Pattern: 

Two letters: we can pick? Then A? Then two letters? 

But R can be at position 1,4,5? So:

Case 1: R at position 1: R ? A ? ?
Case 2: R at position 4: ? ? A R ?
Case 3: R at position 5: ? ? A ? R

Now, our word should test as many possibilities as possible? So perhaps we can choose a word that tests letters at position 1? Or 4? Or 5? So let me consider common words? Also, we need to include new letters? So we haven't tested: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But exclude C,E,N? And R is included? So we have 4 more letters? R is already in? And then other positions?

Our word: position 3 is A: so we need to pick letters for positions 1,2,4,5? And we must include R?

Possible words:

For example, let me put R at position 1? Then: R _ A _ _

But? We must avoid C,E,N? So let's see: common words? Like RAT? But RAT is 3 letters? We need 5 letters? So R?A?S? But R? A? T? S? Words that start with RA?

RAILS? But S is allowed? But position 3 is I? We need position 3 A? So not RAILS? Because position 2 A? Wait, our pattern: position 1 R, position 2 ?, position 3 A, position 4 ?, position 5 ?

So RA?S? or something? What words start with R?A? But then A is at position 2? Then position 3 must be something else? How? We have A fixed at position 3.

So words starting with R? Then anything? Position 2: ?, position 3: A, then ? ?

So R? A???

For example: R--A-- ?

Like: RABID? B I D? But we haven't tested? Also, B and D allowed? Not excluded? Also, E and N excluded? So RABID: R A B I D? Position: 1-R, 2-A? Wait, position 2 A? But our pattern needs A at position 3? So not? Actually, we have A at position 3? So RABID: position 1 R, position 2 A? Then position 3 B? But we want position 3 to be A? So no? We need A at position 3? So the letter at position 2 is not A? So for R_ A__: we need letter at position 2 arbitrary? So many possibilities? Like: ROAST? Then we have O at position 2? And A at position 3? Then ST? But Roast: position 1 R,2 O,3 A? Then ST: position 4 S, position 5 T? So ROAST: R O A S T? Then position 3 A? Yes? And avoids C,E,N? So this? Then we test R at position 1? If R at position 1 is correct? And others?

Also, ROAST includes O,S,T? Which are common.

But what if R is at position 4? Then we have ROAST? R at position 1, which is not where R should be? Then R(-) but O? We don't know? But if R is actually at position 4? Then we would expect: R at position 1: since the word has R? But not at position 1? Then R would get ""-""? And O? We don't know? But we would know O? S? T?

Similarly? Also, if R at position 5? Then same? R(-) at position 1? And then we know S,T,O? Etc.

Another word: we can try R at position 5? So ? ? A ? R? Then for example: words ending with R? Avoid E,N? So? Like SUGAR? But G? Position: S U G A R? Position 3 G? Then 4 A? But we want A at position 3? So? We need A at position 3? So SUGAR? Position: 1 S,2 U,3 G,4 A,5 R? So not? We need A at position 3? So in SUGAR? Position 4 A? No? So we need a word with A at third? Then ends with R? So ? ? A ? R? So the fourth letter arbitrary? Then R at fifth?

For example: words: SOLAR? Position: S O L A R? Position 4 A? Position 3 L? So not? No? We want A at position 3? So SOLAR: position 3 L? So no? We need position 3 A? So ? ? A ? R? So the word ends with two letters? Then R at fifth? And fourth letter arbitrary? For example: TABOR? T A B O R? Position 3 B? Also no? MANOR? M A N? But N excluded? No? We avoid N? So MANOR has N? Even worse? Also, BAR?B? R? Big problem? How to find a word? Like: RADAR? Position 1 R,2 A,3 D,4 A,5 R? So position 3 D? Not A? We want A at position 3? Only at 3? So RADAR has A at 2 and 4? So not.

So ? ? A ?? R? With A at position 3? So the word must have third letter A? And fifth letter R? So two letters at position 1 and 2? Then A? Then? Then R? So position 4 arbitrary? Then R at 5? So _ _ A _ R? 

What words? Like LAR? Something? But no? Words: GEAR? But position 3 G? Not A? GUARD? Position 3 U? BOARD? Position 3 O? 

Actually, I'm struggling? Perhaps words that start with consonants? Then vowel? Then A? Then ? R? For example: STA?R? But STAR is 4? START? Position 1 S,2 T,3 A,4 R,5 T? So START: S T A R T? Position 4 R? Then we have position 5 T? Oh! So START: S T A R T? Third letter A? So it fits? And ends? But R is at position 4? Not 5? So START: positions: 1:S,2:T,3:A,4:R,5:T? So R is at position 4? Then we are testing R at position 4? Which is one possible? Because R could be at 4? Then START uses S,T,R,T? And avoids C,E,N? Also, T is repeated? But we don't know? Actually, START has two T? Also, S is new?

Another word: STARK? Similarly? Or STAFF? R? 

So START? Can we? But we also test S at position 1? T at position 2? And when we know R could be at 1,4,5? But if we use START? S T A R T? Then we are testing: 
- If R is at position 4, then R will get ✓? 
- If it's at position 1? Then it will be (-) because we have R at position 4? Actually, no? The secret word has only one R? Or multiple? We don't know? But maybe? Suppose the secret word has R? But we don't know if only one? So we must design for single? Or multiple? 

But similarly? 

Anyway? 

Back to ROAST? R O A S T? Position 1: R, 2: O, 3: A, 4: S, 5: T? Avoids C,E,N? 

So we can try ROAST? If we choose this? 

Another common word? Like SALAD? But D? And L? Avoid? SALAD: S A L A D? Position 3 L? And we have two A? But position not? We need position 3 A? So SALAD: position 3 L? So not? So not good? 

So ROAST seems good? 

But wait? O? Is O common? And S,T? 

Alternatively? TRAIN? But N excluded? TRAIN? N at the end? Which we exclude? So we must avoid N? So TRAIN? Cannot? 

Another? STAIN? Also N? Avoid? 

BRAIN? Similarly N? Avoid? 

So ROAST? Seems valid? 

Also? We can consider TAR?D? Etc? But ROAST is common? 

So let me choose ROAST? 

In this word? We have:
- R at position 1: which may be correct? Or wrong? 
- O at position 2: we don't know about O?
- A at position 3: which must be ✓? As already known?
- S at position 4: test if S is in the word?
- T at position 5: test if T is in the word?

And if R is at position 4? Then R at position 1 will be (-) because present? And S? Etc? 

Similarly? 

So we get information about R? And about O,S,T? 

Also? Consider if we choose a word with R at position? Different from 2? But also? The possibility that R is at 4 or 5? 

But ROAST will test R at position 1? Which covers one possibility? 

Alternatively? We can choose a word that doesn't put R at 1? But what for? 

For example? Suppose R is at position 5? Then we might test different? But unknown? 

But ROAST seems reasonable? 

Also? We want to use common letters? O,S,T are common? 

Hence? Guess ROAST? 

But wait? In CRANE? We had R(-)? So R is present? But at wrong position? So if we put R at position 1? And if the actual R is at 1? Then ROAST first R: ✓? Or if R is at 5? Then we will see R at 1: (-) ? 

Similarly? 

One more point: The word ROAST? Does it contain any excluded? C,E,N? No? So good? 

So I think ROAST is fine? 

Another word: PLAN?T? Avoid N? So any word without C,E,N? And has A at 3? 

But ROAST? Yes? 

So in summary? Our next word: ROAST? 

<guess>ROAST</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C**, **N**, and **E** are not in the word (marked with ❌).
- **A** is in the correct position (position 3, marked with ✓).
- **R** is in the word but in the wrong position (marked with ➖, so it cannot be at position 2).

We know:
- The secret word has **A** at position 3: `_ _ A _ _`.
- **R** is present but not at position 2, so it must be at position 1, 4, or 5.
- The word cannot contain **C**, **E**, or **N**.

For the next guess:
- We want to keep **A** at position 3 to maintain the known correct letter.
- To test the position of **R**, place it at position 1 to potentially gain immediate clarity if it is correct (✓) or to rule out that position if it gets ➖.
- Test new common letters (like **O**, **S**, **T**) to cover more ground on unprobed letters.
- Avoid using **C**, **E**, **N** as they are confirmed absent.

A suitable word that fits these criteria is **ROAST**:
- Position 3: **A** (confirmed correct).
- Position 1: **R** (tests if **R** is at position 1).
- Positions 2, 4, and 5: **O**, **S**, **T** — new letters not previously tested, all common and likely to provide useful feedback.

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for **R** ('s position and explores three additional letters.",Guess 2: ROAST -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(✓) S(-) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,spark,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Okay, the user wants to play a word-sleuth game similar to Wordle, and it's their first guess. Since this is the initial move with zero prior feedback, I need to pick a strategic starting word. 

Five-letter words with diverse common letters seem optimal for maximizing information. Words like ""CRANE"" cover frequent consonants and vowels - C,R,A,N,E. Alternatives like ""SLATE"" add S/L/T but skip R. 

Considering alphabet distribution, vowels A/E appear crucial, and consonants like S/T/R/N are statistically common in English. ""CRANE"" effectively spreads across these without repeating letters - critical since duplicates waste guess potential. 

The feedback mapping will be key: position matches (✓), misplaced letters (-), and absent ones (x). This first guess aims to test multiple high-frequency letters at once to narrow possibilities faster. 

No need to overcomplicate - ""CRANE"" strikes balance between commonness and letter spread. Let's lock that in.After considering common strategies for the first guess in word games, I've chosen a word that balances vowel and consonant coverage while using statistically common letters in English. My goal is to maximize feedback information:
- Includes two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N)
- Tests letters frequently appearing in 5-letter words
- Avoids repeating letters to cover more possibilities

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We'll go step-by-step based on the feedback we received:

From Guess 1: CRANE → C(x), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(x)

Feedback interpretation:
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since A is the third letter? Wait, let's count: C-R-A-N-E → positions: 1-C, 2-R, 3-A, 4-N, 5-E). So A is at position 3? Actually, let me write it clearly:

Position 1: C → x (not in word)
Position 2: R → - (in word but wrong position)
Position 3: A → ✓ (correct position)
Position 5: E → x (not in word)

Wait, but the word is 5 letters: so positions 1 to 5:

1: C → not in word
2: R → in word but wrong position
3: A → correct position
4: N → not in word
5: E → not in word

So we know:
- The word has an A in the third position: _ _ A _ _
- The word has an R, but not at position 2. So R must be at position 1, 4, or 5? Actually, it could be in any position except 2. So possible positions for R: 1, 4, or 5? But note the third is A, so position 4 and 5 are available? Actually, positions 1, 4 or 5? Wait, position 1 is available too? Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Position 3 is taken by A? Correct? So yes, positions 1,4,5 are available for R? Actually, position 3 is A so R can be at 1,4, or 5? But note position 2 is excluded? Actually, we know R is not at position 2, but it can be elsewhere? Actually, we know R is in the word? Yes, because ""-"" means it's in the word but wrong position? Correct? So R is somewhere else? But we know position 3 is A? So R cannot be at 3? So R must be at 1,4, or 5? But also, we know that positions 1,4,5 are not excluded? Actually we don't know? Only for position 2 we rejected? So indeed, R is at position 1,4, or 5.

Also, we know that C, E, N are not in the word at all? Correct? Because x? So the word does not contain C, E, N at all? Yes? So letters to avoid: C, E, N.

So secret word must:
- Have R somewhere? Correct? But wait: the feedback R(-) means that R is in the word? Yes? So R is present? So yes.

Now, since A is at position 3: _ _ A _ _

And the word must contain R (but not at position 2? Actually, it can be at position 1? If R is at position 1, then we have R ? A ? ? 

Or at position 4: ? ? A R ?

Or at position 5: ? ? A ? R

And the word also must not have C, E, or N? So letters excluded? So we can't use C,E,N.

Also, the letters we have? We have R and A? And we don't know about others? So what letters are possible?

We need to choose a new word that does not use C,E,N? And has R? But wait, we haven't checked other common letters? So we might want to try more common consonants? Or another vowel? Since A is positioned? So let's look for vowels? We haven't tried other vowels? Well E is excluded? So vowels: A is known? So perhaps we try I, O, U? Or sometimes Y? But we don't know about those.

Also, from the excluded letters: C, E, N? So we must avoid these.

We know R is somewhere? So let's make sure R is in our next guess? But it could be at different positions? So we should consider the different cases? Actually, for the next word, we want to try to place R at one of the possible positions (1,4,5) and see what happens? Or we can try multiple positions? Actually, no, since we have one guess? We want to gain information.

Perhaps try a word that has R at position 1? Then if R is actually at position 1, it will be ✓? Or if R is at position 4 or 5, then if we put R at position 1 and the word has R at another position, we will get ""-"" for R? Because it's present but in wrong position? Also, we must consider other letters? So we should avoid C,E,N? And use letters that are common? Because we don't know about others? Also, we must not put A at position 3? We know A is at position 3? So in our next word, we can put A at position 3? Actually, we should! Because A is known at position 3? So we can use that? So the next word should also have A at position 3? Because if we change, it will be wrong? But we know it's fixed? So we want to confirm that? Actually, the feedback already told A is in the correct position? So we can keep A at that position? So that we don't need to guess again? Yes?

So our next word must:
- Have A at position 3: _ _ A _ _
- Contain R? And we want to test where R is?
- Avoid using C, E, N? Because they are excluded?
- We also want to test other letters? So include other common letters? That haven't been used? But CRANE used C,R,A,N,E? So we excluded C,N,E? So letters not used? So we have: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But many options? So we should use common letters? So let me take: S, T, O, P, L? Actually, try S and T? Or S and H? Etc.

But also, we need to have R? So we must include R? So our word: must be 5 letters, with third letter A? And contain R? And no C,E,N? And we can try R at different positions? So let's think of words that fit:

Pattern: 

Two letters: we can pick? Then A? Then two letters? 

But R can be at position 1,4,5? So:

Case 1: R at position 1: R ? A ? ?
Case 2: R at position 4: ? ? A R ?
Case 3: R at position 5: ? ? A ? R

Now, our word should test as many possibilities as possible? So perhaps we can choose a word that tests letters at position 1? Or 4? Or 5? So let me consider common words? Also, we need to include new letters? So we haven't tested: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But exclude C,E,N? And R is included? So we have 4 more letters? R is already in? And then other positions?

Our word: position 3 is A: so we need to pick letters for positions 1,2,4,5? And we must include R?

Possible words:

For example, let me put R at position 1? Then: R _ A _ _

But? We must avoid C,E,N? So let's see: common words? Like RAT? But RAT is 3 letters? We need 5 letters? So R?A?S? But R? A? T? S? Words that start with RA?

RAILS? But S is allowed? But position 3 is I? We need position 3 A? So not RAILS? Because position 2 A? Wait, our pattern: position 1 R, position 2 ?, position 3 A, position 4 ?, position 5 ?

So RA?S? or something? What words start with R?A? But then A is at position 2? Then position 3 must be something else? How? We have A fixed at position 3.

So words starting with R? Then anything? Position 2: ?, position 3: A, then ? ?

So R? A???

For example: R--A-- ?

Like: RABID? B I D? But we haven't tested? Also, B and D allowed? Not excluded? Also, E and N excluded? So RABID: R A B I D? Position: 1-R, 2-A? Wait, position 2 A? But our pattern needs A at position 3? So not? Actually, we have A at position 3? So RABID: position 1 R, position 2 A? Then position 3 B? But we want position 3 to be A? So no? We need A at position 3? So the letter at position 2 is not A? So for R_ A__: we need letter at position 2 arbitrary? So many possibilities? Like: ROAST? Then we have O at position 2? And A at position 3? Then ST? But Roast: position 1 R,2 O,3 A? Then ST: position 4 S, position 5 T? So ROAST: R O A S T? Then position 3 A? Yes? And avoids C,E,N? So this? Then we test R at position 1? If R at position 1 is correct? And others?

Also, ROAST includes O,S,T? Which are common.

But what if R is at position 4? Then we have ROAST? R at position 1, which is not where R should be? Then R(-) but O? We don't know? But if R is actually at position 4? Then we would expect: R at position 1: since the word has R? But not at position 1? Then R would get ""-""? And O? We don't know? But we would know O? S? T?

Similarly? Also, if R at position 5? Then same? R(-) at position 1? And then we know S,T,O? Etc.

Another word: we can try R at position 5? So ? ? A ? R? Then for example: words ending with R? Avoid E,N? So? Like SUGAR? But G? Position: S U G A R? Position 3 G? Then 4 A? But we want A at position 3? So? We need A at position 3? So SUGAR? Position: 1 S,2 U,3 G,4 A,5 R? So not? We need A at position 3? So in SUGAR? Position 4 A? No? So we need a word with A at third? Then ends with R? So ? ? A ? R? So the fourth letter arbitrary? Then R at fifth?

For example: words: SOLAR? Position: S O L A R? Position 4 A? Position 3 L? So not? No? We want A at position 3? So SOLAR: position 3 L? So no? We need position 3 A? So ? ? A ? R? So the word ends with two letters? Then R at fifth? And fourth letter arbitrary? For example: TABOR? T A B O R? Position 3 B? Also no? MANOR? M A N? But N excluded? No? We avoid N? So MANOR has N? Even worse? Also, BAR?B? R? Big problem? How to find a word? Like: RADAR? Position 1 R,2 A,3 D,4 A,5 R? So position 3 D? Not A? We want A at position 3? Only at 3? So RADAR has A at 2 and 4? So not.

So ? ? A ?? R? With A at position 3? So the word must have third letter A? And fifth letter R? So two letters at position 1 and 2? Then A? Then? Then R? So position 4 arbitrary? Then R at 5? So _ _ A _ R? 

What words? Like LAR? Something? But no? Words: GEAR? But position 3 G? Not A? GUARD? Position 3 U? BOARD? Position 3 O? 

Actually, I'm struggling? Perhaps words that start with consonants? Then vowel? Then A? Then ? R? For example: STA?R? But STAR is 4? START? Position 1 S,2 T,3 A,4 R,5 T? So START: S T A R T? Position 4 R? Then we have position 5 T? Oh! So START: S T A R T? Third letter A? So it fits? And ends? But R is at position 4? Not 5? So START: positions: 1:S,2:T,3:A,4:R,5:T? So R is at position 4? Then we are testing R at position 4? Which is one possible? Because R could be at 4? Then START uses S,T,R,T? And avoids C,E,N? Also, T is repeated? But we don't know? Actually, START has two T? Also, S is new?

Another word: STARK? Similarly? Or STAFF? R? 

So START? Can we? But we also test S at position 1? T at position 2? And when we know R could be at 1,4,5? But if we use START? S T A R T? Then we are testing: 
- If R is at position 4, then R will get ✓? 
- If it's at position 1? Then it will be (-) because we have R at position 4? Actually, no? The secret word has only one R? Or multiple? We don't know? But maybe? Suppose the secret word has R? But we don't know if only one? So we must design for single? Or multiple? 

But similarly? 

Anyway? 

Back to ROAST? R O A S T? Position 1: R, 2: O, 3: A, 4: S, 5: T? Avoids C,E,N? 

So we can try ROAST? If we choose this? 

Another common word? Like SALAD? But D? And L? Avoid? SALAD: S A L A D? Position 3 L? And we have two A? But position not? We need position 3 A? So SALAD: position 3 L? So not? So not good? 

So ROAST seems good? 

But wait? O? Is O common? And S,T? 

Alternatively? TRAIN? But N excluded? TRAIN? N at the end? Which we exclude? So we must avoid N? So TRAIN? Cannot? 

Another? STAIN? Also N? Avoid? 

BRAIN? Similarly N? Avoid? 

So ROAST? Seems valid? 

Also? We can consider TAR?D? Etc? But ROAST is common? 

So let me choose ROAST? 

In this word? We have:
- R at position 1: which may be correct? Or wrong? 
- O at position 2: we don't know about O?
- A at position 3: which must be ✓? As already known?
- S at position 4: test if S is in the word?
- T at position 5: test if T is in the word?

And if R is at position 4? Then R at position 1 will be (-) because present? And S? Etc? 

Similarly? 

So we get information about R? And about O,S,T? 

Also? Consider if we choose a word with R at position? Different from 2? But also? The possibility that R is at 4 or 5? 

But ROAST will test R at position 1? Which covers one possibility? 

Alternatively? We can choose a word that doesn't put R at 1? But what for? 

For example? Suppose R is at position 5? Then we might test different? But unknown? 

But ROAST seems reasonable? 

Also? We want to use common letters? O,S,T are common? 

Hence? Guess ROAST? 

But wait? In CRANE? We had R(-)? So R is present? But at wrong position? So if we put R at position 1? And if the actual R is at 1? Then ROAST first R: ✓? Or if R is at 5? Then we will see R at 1: (-) ? 

Similarly? 

One more point: The word ROAST? Does it contain any excluded? C,E,N? No? So good? 

So I think ROAST is fine? 

Another word: PLAN?T? Avoid N? So any word without C,E,N? And has A at 3? 

But ROAST? Yes? 

So in summary? Our next word: ROAST? 

<guess>ROAST</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C**, **N**, and **E** are not in the word (marked with ❌).
- **A** is in the correct position (position 3, marked with ✓).
- **R** is in the word but in the wrong position (marked with ➖, so it cannot be at position 2).

We know:
- The secret word has **A** at position 3: `_ _ A _ _`.
- **R** is present but not at position 2, so it must be at position 1, 4, or 5.
- The word cannot contain **C**, **E**, or **N**.

For the next guess:
- We want to keep **A** at position 3 to maintain the known correct letter.
- To test the position of **R**, place it at position 1 to potentially gain immediate clarity if it is correct (✓) or to rule out that position if it gets ➖.
- Test new common letters (like **O**, **S**, **T**) to cover more ground on unprobed letters.
- Avoid using **C**, **E**, **N** as they are confirmed absent.

A suitable word that fits these criteria is **ROAST**:
- Position 3: **A** (confirmed correct).
- Position 1: **R** (tests if **R** is at position 1).
- Positions 2, 4, and 5: **O**, **S**, **T** — new letters not previously tested, all common and likely to provide useful feedback.

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for **R** ('s position and explores three additional letters.

Since this is the initial move with zero prior feedback, I need to pick a strategic starting word. \n\nFive-letter words with diverse common letters seem optimal for maximizing information. Words like ""CRANE"" cover frequent consonants and vowels - C,R,A,N,E. Alternatives like ""SLATE"" add S/L/T but skip R. \n\nConsidering alphabet distribution, vowels A/E appear crucial, and consonants like S/T/R/N are statistically common in English.

Wait, let\'s count: C-R-A-N-E → positions: 1-C, 2-R, 3-A, 4-N, 5-E). So A is at position 3? Actually, let me write it clearly:\n\nPosition 1: C → x (not in word)\nPosition 2: R → - (in word but wrong position)\nPosition 3: A → ✓ (correct position)\nPosition 5: E → x (not in word)\n\nWait, but the word is 5 letters: so positions 1 to 5:\n\n1: C → not in word\n2: R → in word but wrong position\n3: A → correct position\n4: N → not in word\n5: E → not in word\n\nSo we know:\n- The word has an A in the third position: _ _ A _ _\n- The word has an R, but not at position 2. So R must be at position 1, 4, or 5? Actually, it could be in any position except 2. So possible positions for R: 1, 4, or 5? But note the third is A, so position 4 and 5 are available? Actually, positions 1, 4 or 5? Wait, position 1 is available too? Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Position 3 is taken by A? Correct? So yes, positions 1,4,5 are available for R? Actually, position 3 is A so R can be at 1,4, or 5? But note position 2 is excluded? Actually, we know R is not at position 2, but it can be elsewhere? Actually, we know R is in the word? Yes, because ""-"" means it\'s in the word but wrong position? Correct? So R is somewhere else? But we know position 3 is A? So R cannot be at 3? So R must be at 1,4, or 5? But also, we know that positions 1,4,5 are not excluded? Actually we don\'t know? Only for position 2 we rejected? So indeed, R is at position 1,4, or 5.\n\nAlso, we know that C, E, N are not in the word at all? Correct? Because x? So the word does not contain C, E, N at all? Yes? So letters to avoid: C, E, N.\n\nSo secret word must:\n- Have R somewhere? Correct? But wait: the feedback R(-) means that R is in the word? Yes? So R is present? So yes.\n\nNow, since A is at position 3: _ _ A _ _\n\nAnd the word must contain R (but not at position 2? Actually, it can be at position 1? If R is at position 1, then we have R ? A ? ? \n\nOr at position 4: ? ? A R ?\n\nOr at position 5: ? ? A ? R\n\nAnd the word also must not have C, E, or N? So letters excluded? So we can\'t use C,E,N.\n\nAlso, the letters we have? We have R and A? And we don\'t know about others? So what letters are possible?\n\nWe need to choose a new word that does not use C,E,N? And has R? But wait, we haven\'t checked other common letters? So we might want to try more common consonants? Or another vowel? Since A is positioned? So let\'s look for vowels? We haven\'t tried other vowels? Well E is excluded? So vowels: A is known? So perhaps we try I, O, U? Or sometimes Y? But we don\'t know about those.\n\nAlso, from the excluded letters: C, E, N? So we must avoid these.\n\nWe know R is somewhere? So let\'s make sure R is in our next guess? But it could be at different positions? So we should consider the different cases? Actually, for the next word, we want to try to place R at one of the possible positions (1,4,5) and see what happens? Or we can try multiple positions? Actually, no, since we have one guess? We want to gain information.\n\nPerhaps try a word that has R at position 1? Then if R is actually at position 1, it will be ✓? Or if R is at position 4 or 5, then if we put R at position 1 and the word has R at another position, we will get ""-"" for R? Because it\'s present but in wrong position? Also, we must consider other letters? So we should avoid C,E,N? And use letters that are common? Because we don\'t know about others? Also, we must not put A at position 3? We know A is at position 3? So in our next word, we can put A at position 3? Actually, we should! Because A is known at position 3? So we can use that? So the next word should also have A at position 3? Because if we change, it will be wrong? But we know it\'s fixed? So we want to confirm that? Actually, the feedback already told A is in the correct position? So we can keep A at that position? So that we don\'t need to guess again? Yes?\n\nSo our next word must:\n- Have A at position 3: _ _ A _ _\n- Contain R? And we want to test where R is?\n- Avoid using C, E, N? Because they are excluded?\n- We also want to test other letters? So include other common letters? That haven\'t been used? But CRANE used C,R,A,N,E? So we excluded C,N,E? So letters not used? So we have: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But many options? So we should use common letters? So let me take: S, T, O, P, L? Actually, try S and T? Or S and H? Etc.\n\nBut also, we need to have R? So we must include R? So our word: must be 5 letters, with third letter A? And contain R? And no C,E,N? And we can try R at different positions? So let\'s think of words that fit:\n\nPattern: \n\nTwo letters: we can pick? Then A? Then two letters? \n\nBut R can be at position 1,4,5? So:\n\nCase 1: R at position 1: R ? A ? ?\nCase 2: R at position 4: ? ? A R ?\nCase 3: R at position 5: ? ? A ? R\n\nNow, our word should test as many possibilities as possible? So perhaps we can choose a word that tests letters at position 1? Or 4? Or 5? So let me consider common words? Also, we need to include new letters? So we haven\'t tested: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But exclude C,E,N? And R is included? So we have 4 more letters? R is already in? And then other positions?\n\nOur word: position 3 is A: so we need to pick letters for positions 1,2,4,5? And we must include R?\n\nPossible words:\n\nFor example, let me put R at position 1? Then: R _ A _ _\n\nBut? We must avoid C,E,N? So let\'s see: common words? Like RAT? But RAT is 3 letters? We need 5 letters? So R?A?S? But R? A? T? S? Words that start with RA?\n\nRAILS? But S is allowed? But position 3 is I? We need position 3 A? So not RAILS? Because position 2 A? Wait, our pattern: position 1 R, position 2 ?, position 3 A, position 4 ?, position 5 ?\n\nSo RA?S? or something? What words start with R?A? But then A is at position 2? Then position 3 must be something else? How? We have A fixed at position 3.\n\nSo words starting with R? Then anything? Position 2: ?, position 3: A, then ? ?\n\nSo R? A???\n\nFor example: R--A-- ?\n\nLike: RABID? B I D? But we haven\'t tested? Also, B and D allowed? Not excluded? Also, E and N excluded? So RABID: R A B I D? Position: 1-R, 2-A? Wait, position 2 A? But our pattern needs A at position 3? So not? Actually, we have A at position 3? So RABID: position 1 R, position 2 A? Then position 3 B? But we want position 3 to be A? So no? We need A at position 3? So the letter at position 2 is not A? So for R_ A__: we need letter at position 2 arbitrary? So many possibilities? Like: ROAST? Then we have O at position 2? And A at position 3? Then ST? But Roast: position 1 R,2 O,3 A? Then ST: position 4 S, position 5 T? So ROAST: R O A S T? Then position 3 A? Yes? And avoids C,E,N? So this? Then we test R at position 1? If R at position 1 is correct? And others?\n\nAlso, ROAST includes O,S,T? Which are common.\n\nBut what if R is at position 4? Then we have ROAST? R at position 1, which is not where R should be? Then R(-) but O? We don\'t know? But if R is actually at position 4? Then we would expect: R at position 1: since the word has R? But not at position 1? Then R would get ""-""? And O? We don\'t know? But we would know O? S? T?\n\nSimilarly? Also, if R at position 5? Then same? R(-) at position 1? And then we know S,T,O? Etc.\n\nAnother word: we can try R at position 5? So ? ? A ? R? Then for example: words ending with R? Avoid E,N? So? Like SUGAR? But G? Position: S U G A R? Position 3 G? Then 4 A? But we want A at position 3? So? We need A at position 3? So SUGAR? Position: 1 S,2 U,3 G,4 A,5 R? So not? We need A at position 3? So in SUGAR? Position 4 A? No? So we need a word with A at third? Then ends with R? So ? ? A ? R? So the fourth letter arbitrary? Then R at fifth?\n\nFor example: words: SOLAR? Position: S O L A R? Position 4 A? Position 3 L? So not? No? We want A at position 3? So SOLAR: position 3 L? So no? We need position 3 A? So ? ? A ? R? So the word ends with two letters? Then R at fifth? And fourth letter arbitrary? For example: TABOR? T A B O R? Position 3 B? Also no? MANOR? M A N? But N excluded? No? We avoid N? So MANOR has N? Even worse? Also, BAR?B? R? Big problem? How to find a word? Like: RADAR? Position 1 R,2 A,3 D,4 A,5 R? So position 3 D? Not A? We want A at position 3? Only at 3? So RADAR has A at 2 and 4? So not.\n\nSo ? ? A ?? R? With A at position 3? So the word must have third letter A? And fifth letter R? So two letters at position 1 and 2? Then A? Then? Then R? So position 4 arbitrary? Then R at 5? So _ _ A _ R? \n\nWhat words? Like LAR? Something? But no? Words: GEAR? But position 3 G? Not A? GUARD? Position 3 U? BOARD? Position 3 O? \n\nActually, I\'m struggling? Perhaps words that start with consonants? Then vowel? Then A? Then ? R? For example: STA?R? But STAR is 4? START? Position 1 S,2 T,3 A,4 R,5 T? So START: S T A R T? Position 4 R? Then we have position 5 T? Oh! So START: S T A R T? Third letter A? So it fits? And ends? But R is at position 4? Not 5? So START: positions: 1:S,2:T,3:A,4:R,5:T? So R is at position 4? Then we are testing R at position 4? Which is one possible? Because R could be at 4? Then START uses S,T,R,T? And avoids C,E,N? Also, T is repeated? But we don\'t know? Actually, START has two T? Also, S is new?\n\nAnother word: STARK? Similarly? Or STAFF? R? \n\nSo START? Can we? But we also test S at position 1? T at position 2? And when we know R could be at 1,4,5? But if we use START? S T A R T? Then we are testing: \n- If R is at position 4, then R will get ✓? \n- If it\'s at position 1? Then it will be (-) because we have R at position 4? Actually, no? The secret word has only one R? Or multiple? We don\'t know? But maybe? Suppose the secret word has R? But we don\'t know if only one? So we must design for single? Or multiple? \n\nBut similarly? \n\nAnyway? \n\nBack to ROAST? R O A S T? Position 1: R, 2: O, 3: A, 4: S, 5: T? Avoids C,E,N? \n\nSo we can try ROAST? If we choose this? \n\nAnother common word? Like SALAD? But D? And L? Avoid? SALAD: S A L A D? Position 3 L? And we have two A? But position not? We need position 3 A? So SALAD: position 3 L? So not? So not good? \n\nSo ROAST seems good? \n\nBut wait? O? Is O common? And S,T? \n\nAlternatively? TRAIN? But N excluded? TRAIN? N at the end? Which we exclude? So we must avoid N? So TRAIN? Cannot? \n\nAnother? STAIN? Also N? Avoid? \n\nBRAIN? Similarly N? Avoid? \n\nSo ROAST? Seems valid? \n\nAlso? We can consider TAR?D? Etc? But ROAST is common? \n\nSo let me choose ROAST? \n\nIn this word? We have:\n- R at position 1: which may be correct? Or wrong? \n- O at position 2: we don\'t know about O?\n- A at position 3: which must be ✓? As already known?\n- S at position 4: test if S is in the word?\n- T at position 5: test if T is in the word?\n\nAnd if R is at position 4? Then R at position 1 will be (-) because present? And S? Etc? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nSo we get information about R? And about O,S,T? \n\nAlso? Consider if we choose a word with R at position? Different from 2? But also? The possibility that R is at 4 or 5? \n\nBut ROAST will test R at position 1? Which covers one possibility? \n\nAlternatively? We can choose a word that doesn\'t put R at 1?

Then ROAST first R: ✓? Or if R is at 5? Then we will see R at 1: (-) ? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nOne more point: The word ROAST? Does it contain any excluded? C,E,N? No? So good? \n\nSo I think ROAST is fine? \n\nAnother word: PLAN?T? Avoid N? So any word without C,E,N? And has A at 3? \n\nBut ROAST? Yes? \n\nSo in summary?

We have feedback from two guesses:

**Guess 1: CRANE**
- C: ❌ (not in word)
- R: ➖ (in word, wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct position)
- N: ❌ (not in word)
- E: ❌ (not in word)

**Guess 2: ROAST**
- R: ➖ (in word, wrong position)
- O: ❌ (not in word)
- A: ✓ (correct position)
- S: ➖ (in word, wrong position)
- T: ❌ (not in word)

**What we know:**
1. The word has **A** in the **third position**: `_ _ A _ _`
2. **R** is in the word, but not at position 2 (from first guess) and not at position 1 (from second guess, since R at position 1 got ➖, meaning it's not at position 1). Therefore, **R must be at position 4 or 5**.
3. **S** is in the word, but not at position 4 (since it got ➖ in ROAST at position 4). So S is at position 1, 2, or 5? But note: positions 1,2,4,5 are available? Actually, position 3 is fixed as A, so S can be at 1,2,5? But we know it's not at 4? So positions 1,2,5 are possible for S? However, we don't know about position 2 yet? So S can be at 1,2, or 5? But we must avoid positions where it was already tried? Specifically, it was at position 4 and got ➖, so it's not at 4? But it could be elsewhere? Yes.

4. **Excluded letters**: C, E, N, O, T are not in the word (all marked ❌ in either guess). So we must avoid: C, E, N, O, T.

5. **Included letters**: R, A, S (A is fixed at position 3, R and S are present but positions unknown).

**Positions for R and S:**
- R: must be at position 4 or 5 (since not at 1 or 2? Actually, from first guess, R was at position 2 and got ➖, so not at 2. From second guess, R at position 1 got ➖, so not at 1. And position 3 is A, so R must be at 4 or 5).
- S: was at position 4 in ROAST and got ➖, so not at 4. Therefore, S must be at position 1, 2, or 5? But note: if R is at 4 or 5, then S cannot be at the same position? Unless the word has duplicate letters? But we don't know? So we must consider the possibility of duplicates? However, to be safe, we should assume no duplicates unless forced? But we don't have evidence of duplicates? So let's assume no duplicates for now? Then S cannot be at 4 (already tried) and cannot be at 3 (A), so S must be at 1, 2, or 5? But if R is at 4 or 5, then S must be at 1 or 2? Because if R is at 4, then S can be at 1,2,5? But if R is at 5, then S can be at 1,2,4? But we know S is not at 4? So if R is at 5, then S can be at 1 or 2? Similarly, if R is at 4, then S can be at 1,2,5? But 5 is available? However, if R is at 4, then position 5 is free? So S could be at 5? But then we have two possibilities? 

But we also have to consider that the word has 5 letters? And we know A at 3? And R and S? So we need to find two more letters? 

**Available letters:** We have used: C,R,A,N,E,O,S,T? And excluded: C,E,N,O,T? So available letters: all except C,E,N,O,T? So we can use: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But A is already used? But we can use it again? But we don't know if duplicates? But we have A fixed? So we don't need to use A again? We are focusing on the other positions? 

But we know the word has R and S? So we must include them? And we have two more letters? 

So the word pattern: 
- Position 3: A
- R at 4 or 5
- S at 1,2, or 5? But if R is at 4, then S can be at 1,2,5? If R is at 5, then S can be at 1,2? 

But we also need to avoid the excluded letters? 

**Strategy for next guess:**
- We need to test the positions of R and S? And also test new common letters? 
- We know R is at 4 or 5? So we can try to put R at 4? Then if it's correct, we get ✓? Or if not, then R must be at 5? 
- Similarly, we can test S at a position? 

But we have two unknowns? So we might need to choose a word that tests one of the possibilities? 

Also, we must avoid O,T? Etc? 

Let me consider possible words? 

First, if R is at position 4: then pattern: `_ _ A R _`? 
Then S must be at 1,2, or 5? 

If R is at position 5: then pattern: `_ _ A _ R`? 
Then S must be at 1 or 2? 

We can try to assume R at 4? Then we can test a word with R at 4? 

For example: 
- We can try a word with R at 4? And S at 1? Then we have: `S _ A R ?`? 
- What letter at position 2 and 5? We need to choose common letters? 

But we must avoid C,E,N,O,T? 

So for position 2: we can try a vowel? Like I? Or U? Or consonant? 

Similarly, position 5: we can try a common consonant? 

But we also want to test new letters? 

Alternatively, we can try to put S at position 1? And R at 4? Then we have: `S ? A R ?`? 

What words? Like: 
- SHARK? But H and K? But we haven't tested? But also, we must avoid E? But SHARK: S H A R K? Position 3 A? Then R at 4? Then K at 5? But we don't know about H and K? 
- But H and K are available? 

But we also have to consider that if R is at 5? Then this word would be wrong? 

But we are testing R at 4? 

Similarly, we can try S at 2? Then `? S A R ?`? Like US?R? But USA?R? Not? 

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has both R and S? And tests common letters? 

But we must avoid O,T? 

Let me list possible words? 

We know the word must have A at 3? And R and S? 

Possible patterns:

Case 1: R at 4: then `_ _ A R _`? 
  - Then S can be at 1,2,5? 
  - If S at 1: `S _ A R ?`? 
      - Words: SHARD (but D? and H? and avoid E? SHARD: S H A R D? Avoid? C,E,N,O,T? So H,A,R,D? A and R are known? So H and D? 
      - Or SPARK? But P and K? 
  - If S at 2: `_ S A R ?`? 
      - Words: IS?R? Like ISARM? Not common? US?R? Like USURP? But U and P? 
  - If S at 5: `_ _ A R S`? 
      - Words: BAR?S? But avoid? Like BARKS? But K? And B? 

Case 2: R at 5: then `_ _ A _ R`? 
  - Then S must be at 1 or 2? 
  - If S at 1: `S _ A _ R`? 
      - Words: S?A?R? Like SAL?R? But avoid L? SALAR? But A repeated? And L? Or SAB?R? 
      - Common: SA?R? Like SABER? But E excluded? Or SAD?R? 
      - How about SAU?R? Like SAU?R? SAUCE? But C and E excluded? SAUNA? N excluded? 
      - So difficult? 
  - If S at 2: `_ S A _ R`? 
      - Words: ?S?A?R? Like US?AR? USA?R? But USA?R? Not? Or AS?AR? 

This is getting messy? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests R at 4? And also tests S at a position? And uses common letters? 

We also need to test for the other letters? 

Another idea: we can try to put S at position 1? And R at position 5? Then we have: `S _ A _ R`? 

Then we need two letters? For position 2 and 4? 

We must avoid C,E,N,O,T? 

So for position 2: we can try a vowel? Like I? Or U? Or consonant? 

For position 4: we can try a consonant? 

But we want common words? 

Possible words: 
- SH?A?R? Like SH?R? But SHIRE? H,I,R,E? But E excluded? 
- SH?R? Without E? 
- SHARK? But that has R at 4? Not 5? 
- For `S _ A _ R`: 
  - S?A?R? 
  - Examples: 
      - SAB?R? But B? And what? SABAR? Not word? 
      - SAD?R? SADAR? Not? 
      - SAF?R? SAFAR? Not common? 
      - SAG?R? Not? 
      - SAL?R? SALAR? Not? 
      - SAM?R? SAMAR? Not? 
      - SAP?R? SAPAR? Not? 
      - SAR?R? But R at 4? 
      - SAT?R? SATYR? But Y? And T excluded? 
      - SAV?R? SAVOR? But O excluded? 
      - SAW?R? SAWER? E excluded? 
      - SAX?R? Not? 
      - SAY?R? SAYER? E excluded? 

Not many common words? 

What about SHARP? But P? And R at 4? Not 5? 

Perhaps we should consider that R might be at 4? 

Let me try to find words with R at 4? And S at 1? 

Pattern: `S _ A R ?`? 

Words: 
- SHARK: S H A R K? 
- SHARD: S H A R D? 
- SNARL? But N excluded? 
- SPARK: S P A R K? 
- STARK: S T A R K? But T excluded? 
- SWARM: S W A R M? 

So possible: SHARK, SHARD, SPARK, SWARM? 

But we must avoid T? So STARK is out? 

Now, SHARK: uses H and K? 
SHARD: uses H and D? 
SPARK: uses P and K? 
SWARM: uses W and M? 

All avoid C,E,N,O,T? 

Similarly, we can try S at 2? Pattern: `_ S A R ?`? 

Words: 
- US?AR? Like USHAR? Not? 
- IS?AR? Like ISHAR? Not? 
- AS?AR? ASHAR? Not? 
- PS?AR? Not? 
- WS?AR? Not? 

Not common? 

Or S at 5? Pattern: `_ _ A R S`? 

Words: 
- ? ? A R S? 
- BAR?S? BARES? E excluded? BARNS? N excluded? 
- CAR?S? C excluded? 
- EAR?S? E excluded? 
- FAR?S? FARS? But 4 letters? F only? 
- GAR?S? GARS? 4 letters? 
- HAR?S? HARS? 4? 
- JAR?S? JARS? 4? 
- LAR?S? LARS? 4? 
- MAR?S? MARS? 4? 
- PAR?S? PARS? 4? 
- TAR?S? T excluded? 
- WAR?S? WARS? 4? 

So no common 5-letter words ending with ARS? 

Therefore, the most likely pattern is R at 4 and S at 1? So words like SHARK, SHARD, SPARK, SWARM? 

Now, we need to choose one? And we want to test common letters? 

Also, we haven't tested H, P, K, D, W, M? 

We can choose SHARK? But it has K? 

Or SPARK? 

But note: in SHARK, if we guess it, and if R is actually at 5? Then we will get feedback that R is not at 4? And then we know R must be at 5? 

Similarly, if we guess SHARK: 
- S at 1: if S is at 1, then ✓? Or if not, then ➖? 
- H at 2: we don't know? 
- A at 3: ✓ 
- R at 4: we test if R is at 4? 
- K at 5: we don't know? 

But if the actual word has R at 5? Then in SHARK, R at 4 will be ➖? And we will know R is at 5? 

Similarly, if S is not at 1? Then we get ➖ for S? And then S must be at 2? 

But we don't have many options? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests S at position 2? But we couldn't find common words? 

So let's go with SHARK? 

But we must avoid C,E,N,O,T? SHARK does that? 

Another word: SWARM? S W A R M? 

But we don't know W and M? 

Similarly? 

I think SHARK is a good choice? 

But let's see the feedback we might get? 

We can also consider that we have only 4 guesses left? 

But we need to make a guess? 

Another idea: we can try to put R at 5? And S at 1? But we couldn't find a common word? 

What about ""SIR?R"" but not? 

Or ""SUR?R"" like SURER? But E excluded? 

So not? 

Therefore, I think we should try SHARK? 

But let's list the possibilities? 

The secret word must have:
- A at 3
- R at 4 or 5
- S at 1,2, or 5? But if R is at 4, then S at 1,2,5? If R at 5, then S at 1,2? 

But also, the word has two more letters? 

And we have excluded C,E,N,O,T? 

Possible words? 
- If R at 4: 
  - S at 1: then words like SHARK, SHARD, SPARK, SWARM, etc.
  - S at 2: ?S?AR? But no common words? 
  - S at 5: ? ? A R S? But no common 5-letter words? 
- If R at 5: 
  - S at 1: then `S _ A _ R`? Words: S?A?R? 
      - Possible: SAB?R? Not? 
      - SAD?R? Not? 
      - SAF?R? Not? 
      - SAG?R? Not? 
      - SA?R? Only 4 letters? 
      - SH?R? Like SHIRE? E excluded? 
      - SH?R? Without E? SHIRR? But double R? And I? 
      - SHIRR: S H I R R? But R at 4 and 5? But we have R at 5? And position 4 is R? But then we have two R? But we don't know? 
      - SHIRR is a word? Meaning: to make gathers in cloth by parallel threads? 
      - Or SKIRR? S K I R R? 
      - But we have I? 
  - S at 2: `_ S A _ R`? Words: ?S?A?R? 
      - AS?AR? Not? 
      - IS?AR? Not? 
      - US?AR? Not? 
      - Or with other letters? 

Given the difficulty, it's more likely that R is at 4 and S at 1? 

Therefore, I'll go with **SHARK** as the next guess.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
  - `C` (❌ absent), `R` (➖ present but wrong position), `A` (✓ correct position), `N` (❌ absent), `E` (❌ absent).
- **Guess 2 (ROAST)**:
  - `R` (➖ present but wrong position), `O` (❌ absent), `A` (✓ correct position), `S` (➖ present but wrong position), `T` (❌ absent).

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed position**: 
   - `A` is confirmed at position 3 (e.g., `_ _ A _ _`).
2. **Confirmed present letters**:
   - `R` is in the word but cannot be at positions 1 or 2 (since it got ➖ in both guesses). Thus, `R` must be at **position 4 or 5**.
   - `S` is in the word but cannot be at position 4 (➖ in ROAST). Thus, `S` must be at **position 1, 2, or 5**.
3. **Absent letters**: `C`, `E`, `N`, `O`, `T` are excluded (❌ in either guess). Avoid using these.
4. **Constraints**:
   - Position 3 is fixed as `A`.
   - `R` and `S` must be included, but their positions are uncertain.
   - The word has no duplicates (no feedback suggests duplicates, so we assume none for now).
   - Available letters: Focus on untested common consonants (e.g., `B`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `I`, `K`, `L`, `M`, `P`, `U`, `W`, `Y`) and vowels (`I`, `U`).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test `R` at position 4**: If correct, we get ✓; if ➖, `R` must be at position 5.
- **Test `S` at position 1**: If correct, we get ✓; if ➖, `S` must be at position 2 or 5 (but position 5 may conflict with `R`).
- **Prioritize high-frequency letters**: Include `H` (common consonant) and `K` (common ending letter) to maximize information.
- **Avoid excluded letters**: No `C`, `E`, `N`, `O`, `T`.

**Chosen word: SHARK**  
- `S` at position 1 (tests if `S` is at position 1).
- `H` at position 2 (new untested letter).
- `A` at position 3 (confirmed correct).
- `R` at position 4 (tests if `R` is at position 4).
- `K` at position 5 (new untested letter).

This guess efficiently narrows down the positions of `R` and `S` while probing two new common letters (`H`, `K`). If `R` is not at position 4, it must be at 5, and if `S` is not at 1, it must be at 2 (since position 4 is ruled out and position 5 may be occupied by `R`).

<guess>SHARK</guess>",SHARK,"We have feedback from two guesses:

**Guess 1: CRANE**
- C: ❌ (not in word)
- R: ➖ (in word, wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct position)
- N: ❌ (not in word)
- E: ❌ (not in word)

**Guess 2: ROAST**
- R: ➖ (in word, wrong position)
- O: ❌ (not in word)
- A: ✓ (correct position)
- S: ➖ (in word, wrong position)
- T: ❌ (not in word)

**What we know:**
1. The word has **A** in the **third position**: `_ _ A _ _`
2. **R** is in the word, but not at position 2 (from first guess) and not at position 1 (from second guess, since R at position 1 got ➖, meaning it's not at position 1). Therefore, **R must be at position 4 or 5**.
3. **S** is in the word, but not at position 4 (since it got ➖ in ROAST at position 4). So S is at position 1, 2, or 5? But note: positions 1,2,4,5 are available? Actually, position 3 is fixed as A, so S can be at 1,2,5? But we know it's not at 4? So positions 1,2,5 are possible for S? However, we don't know about position 2 yet? So S can be at 1,2, or 5? But we must avoid positions where it was already tried? Specifically, it was at position 4 and got ➖, so it's not at 4? But it could be elsewhere? Yes.

4. **Excluded letters**: C, E, N, O, T are not in the word (all marked ❌ in either guess). So we must avoid: C, E, N, O, T.

5. **Included letters**: R, A, S (A is fixed at position 3, R and S are present but positions unknown).

**Positions for R and S:**
- R: must be at position 4 or 5 (since not at 1 or 2? Actually, from first guess, R was at position 2 and got ➖, so not at 2. From second guess, R at position 1 got ➖, so not at 1. And position 3 is A, so R must be at 4 or 5).
- S: was at position 4 in ROAST and got ➖, so not at 4. Therefore, S must be at position 1, 2, or 5? But note: if R is at 4 or 5, then S cannot be at the same position? Unless the word has duplicate letters? But we don't know? So we must consider the possibility of duplicates? However, to be safe, we should assume no duplicates unless forced? But we don't have evidence of duplicates? So let's assume no duplicates for now? Then S cannot be at 4 (already tried) and cannot be at 3 (A), so S must be at 1, 2, or 5? But if R is at 4 or 5, then S must be at 1 or 2? Because if R is at 4, then S can be at 1,2,5? But if R is at 5, then S can be at 1,2,4? But we know S is not at 4? So if R is at 5, then S can be at 1 or 2? Similarly, if R is at 4, then S can be at 1,2,5? But 5 is available? However, if R is at 4, then position 5 is free? So S could be at 5? But then we have two possibilities? 

But we also have to consider that the word has 5 letters? And we know A at 3? And R and S? So we need to find two more letters? 

**Available letters:** We have used: C,R,A,N,E,O,S,T? And excluded: C,E,N,O,T? So available letters: all except C,E,N,O,T? So we can use: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But A is already used? But we can use it again? But we don't know if duplicates? But we have A fixed? So we don't need to use A again? We are focusing on the other positions? 

But we know the word has R and S? So we must include them? And we have two more letters? 

So the word pattern: 
- Position 3: A
- R at 4 or 5
- S at 1,2, or 5? But if R is at 4, then S can be at 1,2,5? If R is at 5, then S can be at 1,2? 

But we also need to avoid the excluded letters? 

**Strategy for next guess:**
- We need to test the positions of R and S? And also test new common letters? 
- We know R is at 4 or 5? So we can try to put R at 4? Then if it's correct, we get ✓? Or if not, then R must be at 5? 
- Similarly, we can test S at a position? 

But we have two unknowns? So we might need to choose a word that tests one of the possibilities? 

Also, we must avoid O,T? Etc? 

Let me consider possible words? 

First, if R is at position 4: then pattern: `_ _ A R _`? 
Then S must be at 1,2, or 5? 

If R is at position 5: then pattern: `_ _ A _ R`? 
Then S must be at 1 or 2? 

We can try to assume R at 4? Then we can test a word with R at 4? 

For example: 
- We can try a word with R at 4? And S at 1? Then we have: `S _ A R ?`? 
- What letter at position 2 and 5? We need to choose common letters? 

But we must avoid C,E,N,O,T? 

So for position 2: we can try a vowel? Like I? Or U? Or consonant? 

Similarly, position 5: we can try a common consonant? 

But we also want to test new letters? 

Alternatively, we can try to put S at position 1? And R at 4? Then we have: `S ? A R ?`? 

What words? Like: 
- SHARK? But H and K? But we haven't tested? But also, we must avoid E? But SHARK: S H A R K? Position 3 A? Then R at 4? Then K at 5? But we don't know about H and K? 
- But H and K are available? 

But we also have to consider that if R is at 5? Then this word would be wrong? 

But we are testing R at 4? 

Similarly, we can try S at 2? Then `? S A R ?`? Like US?R? But USA?R? Not? 

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has both R and S? And tests common letters? 

But we must avoid O,T? 

Let me list possible words? 

We know the word must have A at 3? And R and S? 

Possible patterns:

Case 1: R at 4: then `_ _ A R _`? 
  - Then S can be at 1,2,5? 
  - If S at 1: `S _ A R ?`? 
      - Words: SHARD (but D? and H? and avoid E? SHARD: S H A R D? Avoid? C,E,N,O,T? So H,A,R,D? A and R are known? So H and D? 
      - Or SPARK? But P and K? 
  - If S at 2: `_ S A R ?`? 
      - Words: IS?R? Like ISARM? Not common? US?R? Like USURP? But U and P? 
  - If S at 5: `_ _ A R S`? 
      - Words: BAR?S? But avoid? Like BARKS? But K? And B? 

Case 2: R at 5: then `_ _ A _ R`? 
  - Then S must be at 1 or 2? 
  - If S at 1: `S _ A _ R`? 
      - Words: S?A?R? Like SAL?R? But avoid L? SALAR? But A repeated? And L? Or SAB?R? 
      - Common: SA?R? Like SABER? But E excluded? Or SAD?R? 
      - How about SAU?R? Like SAU?R? SAUCE? But C and E excluded? SAUNA? N excluded? 
      - So difficult? 
  - If S at 2: `_ S A _ R`? 
      - Words: ?S?A?R? Like US?AR? USA?R? But USA?R? Not? Or AS?AR? 

This is getting messy? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests R at 4? And also tests S at a position? And uses common letters? 

We also need to test for the other letters? 

Another idea: we can try to put S at position 1? And R at position 5? Then we have: `S _ A _ R`? 

Then we need two letters? For position 2 and 4? 

We must avoid C,E,N,O,T? 

So for position 2: we can try a vowel? Like I? Or U? Or consonant? 

For position 4: we can try a consonant? 

But we want common words? 

Possible words: 
- SH?A?R? Like SH?R? But SHIRE? H,I,R,E? But E excluded? 
- SH?R? Without E? 
- SHARK? But that has R at 4? Not 5? 
- For `S _ A _ R`: 
  - S?A?R? 
  - Examples: 
      - SAB?R? But B? And what? SABAR? Not word? 
      - SAD?R? SADAR? Not? 
      - SAF?R? SAFAR? Not common? 
      - SAG?R? Not? 
      - SAL?R? SALAR? Not? 
      - SAM?R? SAMAR? Not? 
      - SAP?R? SAPAR? Not? 
      - SAR?R? But R at 4? 
      - SAT?R? SATYR? But Y? And T excluded? 
      - SAV?R? SAVOR? But O excluded? 
      - SAW?R? SAWER? E excluded? 
      - SAX?R? Not? 
      - SAY?R? SAYER? E excluded? 

Not many common words? 

What about SHARP? But P? And R at 4? Not 5? 

Perhaps we should consider that R might be at 4? 

Let me try to find words with R at 4? And S at 1? 

Pattern: `S _ A R ?`? 

Words: 
- SHARK: S H A R K? 
- SHARD: S H A R D? 
- SNARL? But N excluded? 
- SPARK: S P A R K? 
- STARK: S T A R K? But T excluded? 
- SWARM: S W A R M? 

So possible: SHARK, SHARD, SPARK, SWARM? 

But we must avoid T? So STARK is out? 

Now, SHARK: uses H and K? 
SHARD: uses H and D? 
SPARK: uses P and K? 
SWARM: uses W and M? 

All avoid C,E,N,O,T? 

Similarly, we can try S at 2? Pattern: `_ S A R ?`? 

Words: 
- US?AR? Like USHAR? Not? 
- IS?AR? Like ISHAR? Not? 
- AS?AR? ASHAR? Not? 
- PS?AR? Not? 
- WS?AR? Not? 

Not common? 

Or S at 5? Pattern: `_ _ A R S`? 

Words: 
- ? ? A R S? 
- BAR?S? BARES? E excluded? BARNS? N excluded? 
- CAR?S? C excluded? 
- EAR?S? E excluded? 
- FAR?S? FARS? But 4 letters? F only? 
- GAR?S? GARS? 4 letters? 
- HAR?S? HARS? 4? 
- JAR?S? JARS? 4? 
- LAR?S? LARS? 4? 
- MAR?S? MARS? 4? 
- PAR?S? PARS? 4? 
- TAR?S? T excluded? 
- WAR?S? WARS? 4? 

So no common 5-letter words ending with ARS? 

Therefore, the most likely pattern is R at 4 and S at 1? So words like SHARK, SHARD, SPARK, SWARM? 

Now, we need to choose one? And we want to test common letters? 

Also, we haven't tested H, P, K, D, W, M? 

We can choose SHARK? But it has K? 

Or SPARK? 

But note: in SHARK, if we guess it, and if R is actually at 5? Then we will get feedback that R is not at 4? And then we know R must be at 5? 

Similarly, if we guess SHARK: 
- S at 1: if S is at 1, then ✓? Or if not, then ➖? 
- H at 2: we don't know? 
- A at 3: ✓ 
- R at 4: we test if R is at 4? 
- K at 5: we don't know? 

But if the actual word has R at 5? Then in SHARK, R at 4 will be ➖? And we will know R is at 5? 

Similarly, if S is not at 1? Then we get ➖ for S? And then S must be at 2? 

But we don't have many options? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests S at position 2? But we couldn't find common words? 

So let's go with SHARK? 

But we must avoid C,E,N,O,T? SHARK does that? 

Another word: SWARM? S W A R M? 

But we don't know W and M? 

Similarly? 

I think SHARK is a good choice? 

But let's see the feedback we might get? 

We can also consider that we have only 4 guesses left? 

But we need to make a guess? 

Another idea: we can try to put R at 5? And S at 1? But we couldn't find a common word? 

What about ""SIR?R"" but not? 

Or ""SUR?R"" like SURER? But E excluded? 

So not? 

Therefore, I think we should try SHARK? 

But let's list the possibilities? 

The secret word must have:
- A at 3
- R at 4 or 5
- S at 1,2, or 5? But if R is at 4, then S at 1,2,5? If R at 5, then S at 1,2? 

But also, the word has two more letters? 

And we have excluded C,E,N,O,T? 

Possible words? 
- If R at 4: 
  - S at 1: then words like SHARK, SHARD, SPARK, SWARM, etc.
  - S at 2: ?S?AR? But no common words? 
  - S at 5: ? ? A R S? But no common 5-letter words? 
- If R at 5: 
  - S at 1: then `S _ A _ R`? Words: S?A?R? 
      - Possible: SAB?R? Not? 
      - SAD?R? Not? 
      - SAF?R? Not? 
      - SAG?R? Not? 
      - SA?R? Only 4 letters? 
      - SH?R? Like SHIRE? E excluded? 
      - SH?R? Without E? SHIRR? But double R? And I? 
      - SHIRR: S H I R R? But R at 4 and 5? But we have R at 5? And position 4 is R? But then we have two R? But we don't know? 
      - SHIRR is a word? Meaning: to make gathers in cloth by parallel threads? 
      - Or SKIRR? S K I R R? 
      - But we have I? 
  - S at 2: `_ S A _ R`? Words: ?S?A?R? 
      - AS?AR? Not? 
      - IS?AR? Not? 
      - US?AR? Not? 
      - Or with other letters? 

Given the difficulty, it's more likely that R is at 4 and S at 1? 

Therefore, I'll go with **SHARK** as the next guess. 

<guess>SHARK</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:

  - `C` (❌ absent), `R` (➖ present but wrong position), `A` (✓ correct position), `N` (❌ absent), `E` (❌ absent).
- **Guess 2 (ROAST)**:
  - `R` (➖ present but wrong position), `O` (❌ absent), `A` (✓ correct position), `S` (➖ present but wrong position), `T` (❌ absent).

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed position**: 
   - `A` is confirmed at position 3 (e.g., `_ _ A _ _`).
2. **Confirmed present letters**:
   - `R` is in the word but cannot be at positions 1 or 2 (since it got ➖ in both guesses). Thus, `R` must be at **position 4 or 5**.
   - `S` is in the word but cannot be at position 4 (➖ in ROAST). Thus, `S` must be at **position 1, 2, or 5**.
3. **Absent letters**: `C`, `E`, `N`, `O`, `T` are excluded (❌ in either guess). Avoid using these.
4. **Constraints**:
   - Position 3 is fixed as `A`.
   - `R` and `S` must be included, but their positions are uncertain.
   - The word has no duplicates (no feedback suggests duplicates, so we assume none for now).
   - Available letters: Focus on untested common consonants (e.g., `B`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `I`, `K`, `L`, `M`, `P`, `U`, `W`, `Y`) and vowels (`I`, `U`).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test `R` at position 4**: If correct, we get ✓; if ➖, `R` must be at position 5.
- **Test `S` at position 1**: If correct, we get ✓; if ➖, `S` must be at position 2 or 5 (but position 5 may conflict with `R`).
- **Prioritize high-frequency letters**: Include `H` (common consonant) and `K` (common ending letter) to maximize information.
- **Avoid excluded letters**: No `C`, `E`, `N`, `O`, `T`.

**Chosen word: SHARK**  
- `S` at position 1 (tests if `S` is at position 1).
- `H` at position 2 (new untested letter).
- `A` at position 3 (confirmed correct).
- `R` at position 4 (tests if `R` is at position 4).
- `K` at position 5 (new untested letter).

This guess efficiently narrows down the positions of `R` and `S` while probing two new common letters (`H`, `K`). If `R` is not at position 4, it must be at 5, and if `S` is not at 1, it must be at 2 (since position 4 is ruled out and position 5 may be occupied by `R`).",Guess 3: SHARK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) A(✓) R(✓) K(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Okay, the user wants to play a word-sleuth game similar to Wordle, and it's their first guess. Since this is the initial move with zero prior feedback, I need to pick a strategic starting word. 

Five-letter words with diverse common letters seem optimal for maximizing information. Words like ""CRANE"" cover frequent consonants and vowels - C,R,A,N,E. Alternatives like ""SLATE"" add S/L/T but skip R. 

Considering alphabet distribution, vowels A/E appear crucial, and consonants like S/T/R/N are statistically common in English. ""CRANE"" effectively spreads across these without repeating letters - critical since duplicates waste guess potential. 

The feedback mapping will be key: position matches (✓), misplaced letters (-), and absent ones (x). This first guess aims to test multiple high-frequency letters at once to narrow possibilities faster. 

No need to overcomplicate - ""CRANE"" strikes balance between commonness and letter spread. Let's lock that in.After considering common strategies for the first guess in word games, I've chosen a word that balances vowel and consonant coverage while using statistically common letters in English. My goal is to maximize feedback information:
- Includes two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N)
- Tests letters frequently appearing in 5-letter words
- Avoids repeating letters to cover more possibilities

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We'll go step-by-step based on the feedback we received:

From Guess 1: CRANE → C(x), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(x)

Feedback interpretation:
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since A is the third letter? Wait, let's count: C-R-A-N-E → positions: 1-C, 2-R, 3-A, 4-N, 5-E). So A is at position 3? Actually, let me write it clearly:

Position 1: C → x (not in word)
Position 2: R → - (in word but wrong position)
Position 3: A → ✓ (correct position)
Position 5: E → x (not in word)

Wait, but the word is 5 letters: so positions 1 to 5:

1: C → not in word
2: R → in word but wrong position
3: A → correct position
4: N → not in word
5: E → not in word

So we know:
- The word has an A in the third position: _ _ A _ _
- The word has an R, but not at position 2. So R must be at position 1, 4, or 5? Actually, it could be in any position except 2. So possible positions for R: 1, 4, or 5? But note the third is A, so position 4 and 5 are available? Actually, positions 1, 4 or 5? Wait, position 1 is available too? Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Position 3 is taken by A? Correct? So yes, positions 1,4,5 are available for R? Actually, position 3 is A so R can be at 1,4, or 5? But note position 2 is excluded? Actually, we know R is not at position 2, but it can be elsewhere? Actually, we know R is in the word? Yes, because ""-"" means it's in the word but wrong position? Correct? So R is somewhere else? But we know position 3 is A? So R cannot be at 3? So R must be at 1,4, or 5? But also, we know that positions 1,4,5 are not excluded? Actually we don't know? Only for position 2 we rejected? So indeed, R is at position 1,4, or 5.

Also, we know that C, E, N are not in the word at all? Correct? Because x? So the word does not contain C, E, N at all? Yes? So letters to avoid: C, E, N.

So secret word must:
- Have R somewhere? Correct? But wait: the feedback R(-) means that R is in the word? Yes? So R is present? So yes.

Now, since A is at position 3: _ _ A _ _

And the word must contain R (but not at position 2? Actually, it can be at position 1? If R is at position 1, then we have R ? A ? ? 

Or at position 4: ? ? A R ?

Or at position 5: ? ? A ? R

And the word also must not have C, E, or N? So letters excluded? So we can't use C,E,N.

Also, the letters we have? We have R and A? And we don't know about others? So what letters are possible?

We need to choose a new word that does not use C,E,N? And has R? But wait, we haven't checked other common letters? So we might want to try more common consonants? Or another vowel? Since A is positioned? So let's look for vowels? We haven't tried other vowels? Well E is excluded? So vowels: A is known? So perhaps we try I, O, U? Or sometimes Y? But we don't know about those.

Also, from the excluded letters: C, E, N? So we must avoid these.

We know R is somewhere? So let's make sure R is in our next guess? But it could be at different positions? So we should consider the different cases? Actually, for the next word, we want to try to place R at one of the possible positions (1,4,5) and see what happens? Or we can try multiple positions? Actually, no, since we have one guess? We want to gain information.

Perhaps try a word that has R at position 1? Then if R is actually at position 1, it will be ✓? Or if R is at position 4 or 5, then if we put R at position 1 and the word has R at another position, we will get ""-"" for R? Because it's present but in wrong position? Also, we must consider other letters? So we should avoid C,E,N? And use letters that are common? Because we don't know about others? Also, we must not put A at position 3? We know A is at position 3? So in our next word, we can put A at position 3? Actually, we should! Because A is known at position 3? So we can use that? So the next word should also have A at position 3? Because if we change, it will be wrong? But we know it's fixed? So we want to confirm that? Actually, the feedback already told A is in the correct position? So we can keep A at that position? So that we don't need to guess again? Yes?

So our next word must:
- Have A at position 3: _ _ A _ _
- Contain R? And we want to test where R is?
- Avoid using C, E, N? Because they are excluded?
- We also want to test other letters? So include other common letters? That haven't been used? But CRANE used C,R,A,N,E? So we excluded C,N,E? So letters not used? So we have: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But many options? So we should use common letters? So let me take: S, T, O, P, L? Actually, try S and T? Or S and H? Etc.

But also, we need to have R? So we must include R? So our word: must be 5 letters, with third letter A? And contain R? And no C,E,N? And we can try R at different positions? So let's think of words that fit:

Pattern: 

Two letters: we can pick? Then A? Then two letters? 

But R can be at position 1,4,5? So:

Case 1: R at position 1: R ? A ? ?
Case 2: R at position 4: ? ? A R ?
Case 3: R at position 5: ? ? A ? R

Now, our word should test as many possibilities as possible? So perhaps we can choose a word that tests letters at position 1? Or 4? Or 5? So let me consider common words? Also, we need to include new letters? So we haven't tested: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But exclude C,E,N? And R is included? So we have 4 more letters? R is already in? And then other positions?

Our word: position 3 is A: so we need to pick letters for positions 1,2,4,5? And we must include R?

Possible words:

For example, let me put R at position 1? Then: R _ A _ _

But? We must avoid C,E,N? So let's see: common words? Like RAT? But RAT is 3 letters? We need 5 letters? So R?A?S? But R? A? T? S? Words that start with RA?

RAILS? But S is allowed? But position 3 is I? We need position 3 A? So not RAILS? Because position 2 A? Wait, our pattern: position 1 R, position 2 ?, position 3 A, position 4 ?, position 5 ?

So RA?S? or something? What words start with R?A? But then A is at position 2? Then position 3 must be something else? How? We have A fixed at position 3.

So words starting with R? Then anything? Position 2: ?, position 3: A, then ? ?

So R? A???

For example: R--A-- ?

Like: RABID? B I D? But we haven't tested? Also, B and D allowed? Not excluded? Also, E and N excluded? So RABID: R A B I D? Position: 1-R, 2-A? Wait, position 2 A? But our pattern needs A at position 3? So not? Actually, we have A at position 3? So RABID: position 1 R, position 2 A? Then position 3 B? But we want position 3 to be A? So no? We need A at position 3? So the letter at position 2 is not A? So for R_ A__: we need letter at position 2 arbitrary? So many possibilities? Like: ROAST? Then we have O at position 2? And A at position 3? Then ST? But Roast: position 1 R,2 O,3 A? Then ST: position 4 S, position 5 T? So ROAST: R O A S T? Then position 3 A? Yes? And avoids C,E,N? So this? Then we test R at position 1? If R at position 1 is correct? And others?

Also, ROAST includes O,S,T? Which are common.

But what if R is at position 4? Then we have ROAST? R at position 1, which is not where R should be? Then R(-) but O? We don't know? But if R is actually at position 4? Then we would expect: R at position 1: since the word has R? But not at position 1? Then R would get ""-""? And O? We don't know? But we would know O? S? T?

Similarly? Also, if R at position 5? Then same? R(-) at position 1? And then we know S,T,O? Etc.

Another word: we can try R at position 5? So ? ? A ? R? Then for example: words ending with R? Avoid E,N? So? Like SUGAR? But G? Position: S U G A R? Position 3 G? Then 4 A? But we want A at position 3? So? We need A at position 3? So SUGAR? Position: 1 S,2 U,3 G,4 A,5 R? So not? We need A at position 3? So in SUGAR? Position 4 A? No? So we need a word with A at third? Then ends with R? So ? ? A ? R? So the fourth letter arbitrary? Then R at fifth?

For example: words: SOLAR? Position: S O L A R? Position 4 A? Position 3 L? So not? No? We want A at position 3? So SOLAR: position 3 L? So no? We need position 3 A? So ? ? A ? R? So the word ends with two letters? Then R at fifth? And fourth letter arbitrary? For example: TABOR? T A B O R? Position 3 B? Also no? MANOR? M A N? But N excluded? No? We avoid N? So MANOR has N? Even worse? Also, BAR?B? R? Big problem? How to find a word? Like: RADAR? Position 1 R,2 A,3 D,4 A,5 R? So position 3 D? Not A? We want A at position 3? Only at 3? So RADAR has A at 2 and 4? So not.

So ? ? A ?? R? With A at position 3? So the word must have third letter A? And fifth letter R? So two letters at position 1 and 2? Then A? Then? Then R? So position 4 arbitrary? Then R at 5? So _ _ A _ R? 

What words? Like LAR? Something? But no? Words: GEAR? But position 3 G? Not A? GUARD? Position 3 U? BOARD? Position 3 O? 

Actually, I'm struggling? Perhaps words that start with consonants? Then vowel? Then A? Then ? R? For example: STA?R? But STAR is 4? START? Position 1 S,2 T,3 A,4 R,5 T? So START: S T A R T? Position 4 R? Then we have position 5 T? Oh! So START: S T A R T? Third letter A? So it fits? And ends? But R is at position 4? Not 5? So START: positions: 1:S,2:T,3:A,4:R,5:T? So R is at position 4? Then we are testing R at position 4? Which is one possible? Because R could be at 4? Then START uses S,T,R,T? And avoids C,E,N? Also, T is repeated? But we don't know? Actually, START has two T? Also, S is new?

Another word: STARK? Similarly? Or STAFF? R? 

So START? Can we? But we also test S at position 1? T at position 2? And when we know R could be at 1,4,5? But if we use START? S T A R T? Then we are testing: 
- If R is at position 4, then R will get ✓? 
- If it's at position 1? Then it will be (-) because we have R at position 4? Actually, no? The secret word has only one R? Or multiple? We don't know? But maybe? Suppose the secret word has R? But we don't know if only one? So we must design for single? Or multiple? 

But similarly? 

Anyway? 

Back to ROAST? R O A S T? Position 1: R, 2: O, 3: A, 4: S, 5: T? Avoids C,E,N? 

So we can try ROAST? If we choose this? 

Another common word? Like SALAD? But D? And L? Avoid? SALAD: S A L A D? Position 3 L? And we have two A? But position not? We need position 3 A? So SALAD: position 3 L? So not? So not good? 

So ROAST seems good? 

But wait? O? Is O common? And S,T? 

Alternatively? TRAIN? But N excluded? TRAIN? N at the end? Which we exclude? So we must avoid N? So TRAIN? Cannot? 

Another? STAIN? Also N? Avoid? 

BRAIN? Similarly N? Avoid? 

So ROAST? Seems valid? 

Also? We can consider TAR?D? Etc? But ROAST is common? 

So let me choose ROAST? 

In this word? We have:
- R at position 1: which may be correct? Or wrong? 
- O at position 2: we don't know about O?
- A at position 3: which must be ✓? As already known?
- S at position 4: test if S is in the word?
- T at position 5: test if T is in the word?

And if R is at position 4? Then R at position 1 will be (-) because present? And S? Etc? 

Similarly? 

So we get information about R? And about O,S,T? 

Also? Consider if we choose a word with R at position? Different from 2? But also? The possibility that R is at 4 or 5? 

But ROAST will test R at position 1? Which covers one possibility? 

Alternatively? We can choose a word that doesn't put R at 1? But what for? 

For example? Suppose R is at position 5? Then we might test different? But unknown? 

But ROAST seems reasonable? 

Also? We want to use common letters? O,S,T are common? 

Hence? Guess ROAST? 

But wait? In CRANE? We had R(-)? So R is present? But at wrong position? So if we put R at position 1? And if the actual R is at 1? Then ROAST first R: ✓? Or if R is at 5? Then we will see R at 1: (-) ? 

Similarly? 

One more point: The word ROAST? Does it contain any excluded? C,E,N? No? So good? 

So I think ROAST is fine? 

Another word: PLAN?T? Avoid N? So any word without C,E,N? And has A at 3? 

But ROAST? Yes? 

So in summary? Our next word: ROAST? 

<guess>ROAST</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C**, **N**, and **E** are not in the word (marked with ❌).
- **A** is in the correct position (position 3, marked with ✓).
- **R** is in the word but in the wrong position (marked with ➖, so it cannot be at position 2).

We know:
- The secret word has **A** at position 3: `_ _ A _ _`.
- **R** is present but not at position 2, so it must be at position 1, 4, or 5.
- The word cannot contain **C**, **E**, or **N**.

For the next guess:
- We want to keep **A** at position 3 to maintain the known correct letter.
- To test the position of **R**, place it at position 1 to potentially gain immediate clarity if it is correct (✓) or to rule out that position if it gets ➖.
- Test new common letters (like **O**, **S**, **T**) to cover more ground on unprobed letters.
- Avoid using **C**, **E**, **N** as they are confirmed absent.

A suitable word that fits these criteria is **ROAST**:
- Position 3: **A** (confirmed correct).
- Position 1: **R** (tests if **R** is at position 1).
- Positions 2, 4, and 5: **O**, **S**, **T** — new letters not previously tested, all common and likely to provide useful feedback.

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for **R** ('s position and explores three additional letters.

<guess>ROAST</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROAST -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(✓) S(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

**Guess 1: CRANE**
- C: ❌ (not in word)
- R: ➖ (in word, wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct position)
- N: ❌ (not in word)
- E: ❌ (not in word)

**Guess 2: ROAST**
- R: ➖ (in word, wrong position)
- O: ❌ (not in word)
- A: ✓ (correct position)
- S: ➖ (in word, wrong position)
- T: ❌ (not in word)

**What we know:**
1. The word has **A** in the **third position**: `_ _ A _ _`
2. **R** is in the word, but not at position 2 (from first guess) and not at position 1 (from second guess, since R at position 1 got ➖, meaning it's not at position 1). Therefore, **R must be at position 4 or 5**.
3. **S** is in the word, but not at position 4 (since it got ➖ in ROAST at position 4). So S is at position 1, 2, or 5? But note: positions 1,2,4,5 are available? Actually, position 3 is fixed as A, so S can be at 1,2,5? But we know it's not at 4? So positions 1,2,5 are possible for S? However, we don't know about position 2 yet? So S can be at 1,2, or 5? But we must avoid positions where it was already tried? Specifically, it was at position 4 and got ➖, so it's not at 4? But it could be elsewhere? Yes.

4. **Excluded letters**: C, E, N, O, T are not in the word (all marked ❌ in either guess). So we must avoid: C, E, N, O, T.

5. **Included letters**: R, A, S (A is fixed at position 3, R and S are present but positions unknown).

**Positions for R and S:**
- R: must be at position 4 or 5 (since not at 1 or 2? Actually, from first guess, R was at position 2 and got ➖, so not at 2. From second guess, R at position 1 got ➖, so not at 1. And position 3 is A, so R must be at 4 or 5).
- S: was at position 4 in ROAST and got ➖, so not at 4. Therefore, S must be at position 1, 2, or 5? But note: if R is at 4 or 5, then S cannot be at the same position? Unless the word has duplicate letters? But we don't know? So we must consider the possibility of duplicates? However, to be safe, we should assume no duplicates unless forced? But we don't have evidence of duplicates? So let's assume no duplicates for now? Then S cannot be at 4 (already tried) and cannot be at 3 (A), so S must be at 1, 2, or 5? But if R is at 4 or 5, then S must be at 1 or 2? Because if R is at 4, then S can be at 1,2,5? But if R is at 5, then S can be at 1,2,4? But we know S is not at 4? So if R is at 5, then S can be at 1 or 2? Similarly, if R is at 4, then S can be at 1,2,5? But 5 is available? However, if R is at 4, then position 5 is free? So S could be at 5? But then we have two possibilities? 

But we also have to consider that the word has 5 letters? And we know A at 3? And R and S? So we need to find two more letters? 

**Available letters:** We have used: C,R,A,N,E,O,S,T? And excluded: C,E,N,O,T? So available letters: all except C,E,N,O,T? So we can use: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But A is already used? But we can use it again? But we don't know if duplicates? But we have A fixed? So we don't need to use A again? We are focusing on the other positions? 

But we know the word has R and S? So we must include them? And we have two more letters? 

So the word pattern: 
- Position 3: A
- R at 4 or 5
- S at 1,2, or 5? But if R is at 4, then S can be at 1,2,5? If R is at 5, then S can be at 1,2? 

But we also need to avoid the excluded letters? 

**Strategy for next guess:**
- We need to test the positions of R and S? And also test new common letters? 
- We know R is at 4 or 5? So we can try to put R at 4? Then if it's correct, we get ✓? Or if not, then R must be at 5? 
- Similarly, we can test S at a position? 

But we have two unknowns? So we might need to choose a word that tests one of the possibilities? 

Also, we must avoid O,T? Etc? 

Let me consider possible words? 

First, if R is at position 4: then pattern: `_ _ A R _`? 
Then S must be at 1,2, or 5? 

If R is at position 5: then pattern: `_ _ A _ R`? 
Then S must be at 1 or 2? 

We can try to assume R at 4? Then we can test a word with R at 4? 

For example: 
- We can try a word with R at 4? And S at 1? Then we have: `S _ A R ?`? 
- What letter at position 2 and 5? We need to choose common letters? 

But we must avoid C,E,N,O,T? 

So for position 2: we can try a vowel? Like I? Or U? Or consonant? 

Similarly, position 5: we can try a common consonant? 

But we also want to test new letters? 

Alternatively, we can try to put S at position 1? And R at 4? Then we have: `S ? A R ?`? 

What words? Like: 
- SHARK? But H and K? But we haven't tested? But also, we must avoid E? But SHARK: S H A R K? Position 3 A? Then R at 4? Then K at 5? But we don't know about H and K? 
- But H and K are available? 

But we also have to consider that if R is at 5? Then this word would be wrong? 

But we are testing R at 4? 

Similarly, we can try S at 2? Then `? S A R ?`? Like US?R? But USA?R? Not? 

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has both R and S? And tests common letters? 

But we must avoid O,T? 

Let me list possible words? 

We know the word must have A at 3? And R and S? 

Possible patterns:

Case 1: R at 4: then `_ _ A R _`? 
  - Then S can be at 1,2,5? 
  - If S at 1: `S _ A R ?`? 
      - Words: SHARD (but D? and H? and avoid E? SHARD: S H A R D? Avoid? C,E,N,O,T? So H,A,R,D? A and R are known? So H and D? 
      - Or SPARK? But P and K? 
  - If S at 2: `_ S A R ?`? 
      - Words: IS?R? Like ISARM? Not common? US?R? Like USURP? But U and P? 
  - If S at 5: `_ _ A R S`? 
      - Words: BAR?S? But avoid? Like BARKS? But K? And B? 

Case 2: R at 5: then `_ _ A _ R`? 
  - Then S must be at 1 or 2? 
  - If S at 1: `S _ A _ R`? 
      - Words: S?A?R? Like SAL?R? But avoid L? SALAR? But A repeated? And L? Or SAB?R? 
      - Common: SA?R? Like SABER? But E excluded? Or SAD?R? 
      - How about SAU?R? Like SAU?R? SAUCE? But C and E excluded? SAUNA? N excluded? 
      - So difficult? 
  - If S at 2: `_ S A _ R`? 
      - Words: ?S?A?R? Like US?AR? USA?R? But USA?R? Not? Or AS?AR? 

This is getting messy? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests R at 4? And also tests S at a position? And uses common letters? 

We also need to test for the other letters? 

Another idea: we can try to put S at position 1? And R at position 5? Then we have: `S _ A _ R`? 

Then we need two letters? For position 2 and 4? 

We must avoid C,E,N,O,T? 

So for position 2: we can try a vowel? Like I? Or U? Or consonant? 

For position 4: we can try a consonant? 

But we want common words? 

Possible words: 
- SH?A?R? Like SH?R? But SHIRE? H,I,R,E? But E excluded? 
- SH?R? Without E? 
- SHARK? But that has R at 4? Not 5? 
- For `S _ A _ R`: 
  - S?A?R? 
  - Examples: 
      - SAB?R? But B? And what? SABAR? Not word? 
      - SAD?R? SADAR? Not? 
      - SAF?R? SAFAR? Not common? 
      - SAG?R? Not? 
      - SAL?R? SALAR? Not? 
      - SAM?R? SAMAR? Not? 
      - SAP?R? SAPAR? Not? 
      - SAR?R? But R at 4? 
      - SAT?R? SATYR? But Y? And T excluded? 
      - SAV?R? SAVOR? But O excluded? 
      - SAW?R? SAWER? E excluded? 
      - SAX?R? Not? 
      - SAY?R? SAYER? E excluded? 

Not many common words? 

What about SHARP? But P? And R at 4? Not 5? 

Perhaps we should consider that R might be at 4? 

Let me try to find words with R at 4? And S at 1? 

Pattern: `S _ A R ?`? 

Words: 
- SHARK: S H A R K? 
- SHARD: S H A R D? 
- SNARL? But N excluded? 
- SPARK: S P A R K? 
- STARK: S T A R K? But T excluded? 
- SWARM: S W A R M? 

So possible: SHARK, SHARD, SPARK, SWARM? 

But we must avoid T? So STARK is out? 

Now, SHARK: uses H and K? 
SHARD: uses H and D? 
SPARK: uses P and K? 
SWARM: uses W and M? 

All avoid C,E,N,O,T? 

Similarly, we can try S at 2? Pattern: `_ S A R ?`? 

Words: 
- US?AR? Like USHAR? Not? 
- IS?AR? Like ISHAR? Not? 
- AS?AR? ASHAR? Not? 
- PS?AR? Not? 
- WS?AR? Not? 

Not common? 

Or S at 5? Pattern: `_ _ A R S`? 

Words: 
- ? ? A R S? 
- BAR?S? BARES? E excluded? BARNS? N excluded? 
- CAR?S? C excluded? 
- EAR?S? E excluded? 
- FAR?S? FARS? But 4 letters? F only? 
- GAR?S? GARS? 4 letters? 
- HAR?S? HARS? 4? 
- JAR?S? JARS? 4? 
- LAR?S? LARS? 4? 
- MAR?S? MARS? 4? 
- PAR?S? PARS? 4? 
- TAR?S? T excluded? 
- WAR?S? WARS? 4? 

So no common 5-letter words ending with ARS? 

Therefore, the most likely pattern is R at 4 and S at 1? So words like SHARK, SHARD, SPARK, SWARM? 

Now, we need to choose one? And we want to test common letters? 

Also, we haven't tested H, P, K, D, W, M? 

We can choose SHARK? But it has K? 

Or SPARK? 

But note: in SHARK, if we guess it, and if R is actually at 5? Then we will get feedback that R is not at 4? And then we know R must be at 5? 

Similarly, if we guess SHARK: 
- S at 1: if S is at 1, then ✓? Or if not, then ➖? 
- H at 2: we don't know? 
- A at 3: ✓ 
- R at 4: we test if R is at 4? 
- K at 5: we don't know? 

But if the actual word has R at 5? Then in SHARK, R at 4 will be ➖? And we will know R is at 5? 

Similarly, if S is not at 1? Then we get ➖ for S? And then S must be at 2? 

But we don't have many options? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests S at position 2? But we couldn't find common words? 

So let's go with SHARK? 

But we must avoid C,E,N,O,T? SHARK does that? 

Another word: SWARM? S W A R M? 

But we don't know W and M? 

Similarly? 

I think SHARK is a good choice? 

But let's see the feedback we might get? 

We can also consider that we have only 4 guesses left? 

But we need to make a guess? 

Another idea: we can try to put R at 5? And S at 1? But we couldn't find a common word? 

What about ""SIR?R"" but not? 

Or ""SUR?R"" like SURER? But E excluded? 

So not? 

Therefore, I think we should try SHARK? 

But let's list the possibilities? 

The secret word must have:
- A at 3
- R at 4 or 5
- S at 1,2, or 5? But if R is at 4, then S at 1,2,5? If R at 5, then S at 1,2? 

But also, the word has two more letters? 

And we have excluded C,E,N,O,T? 

Possible words? 
- If R at 4: 
  - S at 1: then words like SHARK, SHARD, SPARK, SWARM, etc.
  - S at 2: ?S?AR? But no common words? 
  - S at 5: ? ? A R S? But no common 5-letter words? 
- If R at 5: 
  - S at 1: then `S _ A _ R`? Words: S?A?R? 
      - Possible: SAB?R? Not? 
      - SAD?R? Not? 
      - SAF?R? Not? 
      - SAG?R? Not? 
      - SA?R? Only 4 letters? 
      - SH?R? Like SHIRE? E excluded? 
      - SH?R? Without E? SHIRR? But double R? And I? 
      - SHIRR: S H I R R? But R at 4 and 5? But we have R at 5? And position 4 is R? But then we have two R? But we don't know? 
      - SHIRR is a word? Meaning: to make gathers in cloth by parallel threads? 
      - Or SKIRR? S K I R R? 
      - But we have I? 
  - S at 2: `_ S A _ R`? Words: ?S?A?R? 
      - AS?AR? Not? 
      - IS?AR? Not? 
      - US?AR? Not? 
      - Or with other letters? 

Given the difficulty, it's more likely that R is at 4 and S at 1? 

Therefore, I'll go with **SHARK** as the next guess. 

<guess>SHARK</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
  - `C` (❌ absent), `R` (➖ present but wrong position), `A` (✓ correct position), `N` (❌ absent), `E` (❌ absent).
- **Guess 2 (ROAST)**:
  - `R` (➖ present but wrong position), `O` (❌ absent), `A` (✓ correct position), `S` (➖ present but wrong position), `T` (❌ absent).

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed position**: 
   - `A` is confirmed at position 3 (e.g., `_ _ A _ _`).
2. **Confirmed present letters**:
   - `R` is in the word but cannot be at positions 1 or 2 (since it got ➖ in both guesses). Thus, `R` must be at **position 4 or 5**.
   - `S` is in the word but cannot be at position 4 (➖ in ROAST). Thus, `S` must be at **position 1, 2, or 5**.
3. **Absent letters**: `C`, `E`, `N`, `O`, `T` are excluded (❌ in either guess). Avoid using these.
4. **Constraints**:
   - Position 3 is fixed as `A`.
   - `R` and `S` must be included, but their positions are uncertain.
   - The word has no duplicates (no feedback suggests duplicates, so we assume none for now).
   - Available letters: Focus on untested common consonants (e.g., `B`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `I`, `K`, `L`, `M`, `P`, `U`, `W`, `Y`) and vowels (`I`, `U`).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test `R` at position 4**: If correct, we get ✓; if ➖, `R` must be at position 5.
- **Test `S` at position 1**: If correct, we get ✓; if ➖, `S` must be at position 2 or 5 (but position 5 may conflict with `R`).
- **Prioritize high-frequency letters**: Include `H` (common consonant) and `K` (common ending letter) to maximize information.
- **Avoid excluded letters**: No `C`, `E`, `N`, `O`, `T`.

**Chosen word: SHARK**  
- `S` at position 1 (tests if `S` is at position 1).
- `H` at position 2 (new untested letter).
- `A` at position 3 (confirmed correct).
- `R` at position 4 (tests if `R` is at position 4).
- `K` at position 5 (new untested letter).

This guess efficiently narrows down the positions of `R` and `S` while probing two new common letters (`H`, `K`). If `R` is not at position 4, it must be at 5, and if `S` is not at 1, it must be at 2 (since position 4 is ruled out and position 5 may be occupied by `R`).

Since this is the initial move with zero prior feedback, I need to pick a strategic starting word. \n\nFive-letter words with diverse common letters seem optimal for maximizing information.

Wait, let\'s count: C-R-A-N-E → positions: 1-C, 2-R, 3-A, 4-N, 5-E). So A is at position 3? Actually, let me write it clearly:\n\nPosition 1: C → x (not in word)\nPosition 2: R → - (in word but wrong position)\nPosition 3: A → ✓ (correct position)\nPosition 5: E → x (not in word)\n\nWait, but the word is 5 letters: so positions 1 to 5:\n\n1: C → not in word\n2: R → in word but wrong position\n3: A → correct position\n4: N → not in word\n5: E → not in word\n\nSo we know:\n- The word has an A in the third position: _ _ A _ _\n- The word has an R, but not at position 2. So R must be at position 1, 4, or 5? Actually, it could be in any position except 2. So possible positions for R: 1, 4, or 5? But note the third is A, so position 4 and 5 are available? Actually, positions 1, 4 or 5? Wait, position 1 is available too? Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Position 3 is taken by A? Correct? So yes, positions 1,4,5 are available for R? Actually, position 3 is A so R can be at 1,4, or 5? But note position 2 is excluded? Actually, we know R is not at position 2, but it can be elsewhere? Actually, we know R is in the word? Yes, because ""-"" means it\'s in the word but wrong position? Correct? So R is somewhere else? But we know position 3 is A? So R cannot be at 3? So R must be at 1,4, or 5? But also, we know that positions 1,4,5 are not excluded? Actually we don\'t know? Only for position 2 we rejected? So indeed, R is at position 1,4, or 5.\n\nAlso, we know that C, E, N are not in the word at all? Correct? Because x? So the word does not contain C, E, N at all? Yes? So letters to avoid: C, E, N.\n\nSo secret word must:\n- Have R somewhere? Correct? But wait: the feedback R(-) means that R is in the word? Yes? So R is present? So yes.\n\nNow, since A is at position 3: _ _ A _ _\n\nAnd the word must contain R (but not at position 2? Actually, it can be at position 1? If R is at position 1, then we have R ? A ? ? \n\nOr at position 4: ? ? A R ?\n\nOr at position 5: ? ? A ? R\n\nAnd the word also must not have C, E, or N? So letters excluded? So we can\'t use C,E,N.\n\nAlso, the letters we have? We have R and A? And we don\'t know about others? So what letters are possible?\n\nWe need to choose a new word that does not use C,E,N? And has R? But wait, we haven\'t checked other common letters? So we might want to try more common consonants? Or another vowel? Since A is positioned? So let\'s look for vowels? We haven\'t tried other vowels? Well E is excluded? So vowels: A is known? So perhaps we try I, O, U? Or sometimes Y? But we don\'t know about those.\n\nAlso, from the excluded letters: C, E, N? So we must avoid these.\n\nWe know R is somewhere? So let\'s make sure R is in our next guess? But it could be at different positions? So we should consider the different cases? Actually, for the next word, we want to try to place R at one of the possible positions (1,4,5) and see what happens? Or we can try multiple positions? Actually, no, since we have one guess? We want to gain information.\n\nPerhaps try a word that has R at position 1? Then if R is actually at position 1, it will be ✓? Or if R is at position 4 or 5, then if we put R at position 1 and the word has R at another position, we will get ""-"" for R? Because it\'s present but in wrong position? Also, we must consider other letters? So we should avoid C,E,N? And use letters that are common? Because we don\'t know about others? Also, we must not put A at position 3? We know A is at position 3? So in our next word, we can put A at position 3? Actually, we should! Because A is known at position 3? So we can use that? So the next word should also have A at position 3? Because if we change, it will be wrong? But we know it\'s fixed? So we want to confirm that? Actually, the feedback already told A is in the correct position? So we can keep A at that position? So that we don\'t need to guess again? Yes?\n\nSo our next word must:\n- Have A at position 3: _ _ A _ _\n- Contain R? And we want to test where R is?\n- Avoid using C, E, N? Because they are excluded?\n- We also want to test other letters? So include other common letters? That haven\'t been used? But CRANE used C,R,A,N,E? So we excluded C,N,E? So letters not used? So we have: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But many options? So we should use common letters? So let me take: S, T, O, P, L? Actually, try S and T? Or S and H? Etc.\n\nBut also, we need to have R? So we must include R? So our word: must be 5 letters, with third letter A? And contain R? And no C,E,N? And we can try R at different positions? So let\'s think of words that fit:\n\nPattern: \n\nTwo letters: we can pick? Then A? Then two letters? \n\nBut R can be at position 1,4,5? So:\n\nCase 1: R at position 1: R ? A ? ?\nCase 2: R at position 4: ? ? A R ?\nCase 3: R at position 5: ? ? A ? R\n\nNow, our word should test as many possibilities as possible? So perhaps we can choose a word that tests letters at position 1? Or 4? Or 5? So let me consider common words? Also, we need to include new letters? So we haven\'t tested: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But exclude C,E,N? And R is included? So we have 4 more letters? R is already in? And then other positions?\n\nOur word: position 3 is A: so we need to pick letters for positions 1,2,4,5? And we must include R?\n\nPossible words:\n\nFor example, let me put R at position 1? Then: R _ A _ _\n\nBut? We must avoid C,E,N? So let\'s see: common words? Like RAT? But RAT is 3 letters? We need 5 letters? So R?A?S? But R? A? T? S? Words that start with RA?\n\nRAILS? But S is allowed? But position 3 is I? We need position 3 A? So not RAILS? Because position 2 A? Wait, our pattern: position 1 R, position 2 ?, position 3 A, position 4 ?, position 5 ?\n\nSo RA?S? or something? What words start with R?A? But then A is at position 2? Then position 3 must be something else? How? We have A fixed at position 3.\n\nSo words starting with R? Then anything? Position 2: ?, position 3: A, then ? ?\n\nSo R? A???\n\nFor example: R--A-- ?\n\nLike: RABID? B I D? But we haven\'t tested? Also, B and D allowed? Not excluded? Also, E and N excluded? So RABID: R A B I D? Position: 1-R, 2-A? Wait, position 2 A? But our pattern needs A at position 3? So not? Actually, we have A at position 3? So RABID: position 1 R, position 2 A? Then position 3 B? But we want position 3 to be A? So no? We need A at position 3? So the letter at position 2 is not A? So for R_ A__: we need letter at position 2 arbitrary? So many possibilities? Like: ROAST? Then we have O at position 2? And A at position 3? Then ST? But Roast: position 1 R,2 O,3 A? Then ST: position 4 S, position 5 T? So ROAST: R O A S T? Then position 3 A? Yes? And avoids C,E,N? So this? Then we test R at position 1? If R at position 1 is correct? And others?\n\nAlso, ROAST includes O,S,T? Which are common.\n\nBut what if R is at position 4? Then we have ROAST? R at position 1, which is not where R should be? Then R(-) but O? We don\'t know? But if R is actually at position 4? Then we would expect: R at position 1: since the word has R? But not at position 1? Then R would get ""-""? And O? We don\'t know? But we would know O? S? T?\n\nSimilarly? Also, if R at position 5? Then same? R(-) at position 1? And then we know S,T,O? Etc.\n\nAnother word: we can try R at position 5? So ? ? A ? R? Then for example: words ending with R? Avoid E,N? So? Like SUGAR? But G? Position: S U G A R? Position 3 G? Then 4 A? But we want A at position 3? So? We need A at position 3? So SUGAR? Position: 1 S,2 U,3 G,4 A,5 R? So not? We need A at position 3? So in SUGAR? Position 4 A? No? So we need a word with A at third? Then ends with R? So ? ? A ? R? So the fourth letter arbitrary? Then R at fifth?\n\nFor example: words: SOLAR? Position: S O L A R? Position 4 A? Position 3 L? So not? No? We want A at position 3? So SOLAR: position 3 L? So no? We need position 3 A? So ? ? A ? R? So the word ends with two letters? Then R at fifth? And fourth letter arbitrary? For example: TABOR? T A B O R? Position 3 B? Also no? MANOR? M A N? But N excluded? No? We avoid N? So MANOR has N? Even worse? Also, BAR?B? R? Big problem? How to find a word? Like: RADAR? Position 1 R,2 A,3 D,4 A,5 R? So position 3 D? Not A? We want A at position 3? Only at 3? So RADAR has A at 2 and 4? So not.\n\nSo ? ? A ?? R? With A at position 3? So the word must have third letter A? And fifth letter R? So two letters at position 1 and 2? Then A? Then? Then R? So position 4 arbitrary? Then R at 5? So _ _ A _ R? \n\nWhat words? Like LAR? Something? But no? Words: GEAR? But position 3 G? Not A? GUARD? Position 3 U? BOARD? Position 3 O? \n\nActually, I\'m struggling? Perhaps words that start with consonants? Then vowel? Then A? Then ? R? For example: STA?R? But STAR is 4? START? Position 1 S,2 T,3 A,4 R,5 T? So START: S T A R T? Position 4 R? Then we have position 5 T? Oh! So START: S T A R T? Third letter A? So it fits? And ends? But R is at position 4? Not 5? So START: positions: 1:S,2:T,3:A,4:R,5:T? So R is at position 4? Then we are testing R at position 4? Which is one possible? Because R could be at 4? Then START uses S,T,R,T? And avoids C,E,N? Also, T is repeated? But we don\'t know? Actually, START has two T? Also, S is new?\n\nAnother word: STARK? Similarly? Or STAFF? R? \n\nSo START? Can we? But we also test S at position 1? T at position 2? And when we know R could be at 1,4,5? But if we use START? S T A R T? Then we are testing: \n- If R is at position 4, then R will get ✓? \n- If it\'s at position 1? Then it will be (-) because we have R at position 4? Actually, no? The secret word has only one R? Or multiple? We don\'t know? But maybe? Suppose the secret word has R? But we don\'t know if only one? So we must design for single? Or multiple? \n\nBut similarly? \n\nAnyway? \n\nBack to ROAST? R O A S T? Position 1: R, 2: O, 3: A, 4: S, 5: T? Avoids C,E,N? \n\nSo we can try ROAST? If we choose this? \n\nAnother common word? Like SALAD? But D? And L? Avoid? SALAD: S A L A D? Position 3 L? And we have two A? But position not? We need position 3 A? So SALAD: position 3 L? So not? So not good? \n\nSo ROAST seems good? \n\nBut wait? O? Is O common? And S,T? \n\nAlternatively? TRAIN? But N excluded? TRAIN? N at the end? Which we exclude? So we must avoid N? So TRAIN? Cannot? \n\nAnother? STAIN? Also N? Avoid? \n\nBRAIN? Similarly N? Avoid? \n\nSo ROAST? Seems valid? \n\nAlso? We can consider TAR?D? Etc? But ROAST is common? \n\nSo let me choose ROAST? \n\nIn this word? We have:\n- R at position 1: which may be correct? Or wrong? \n- O at position 2: we don\'t know about O?\n- A at position 3: which must be ✓? As already known?\n- S at position 4: test if S is in the word?\n- T at position 5: test if T is in the word?\n\nAnd if R is at position 4? Then R at position 1 will be (-) because present? And S? Etc? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nSo we get information about R? And about O,S,T? \n\nAlso? Consider if we choose a word with R at position? Different from 2? But also? The possibility that R is at 4 or 5? \n\nBut ROAST will test R at position 1? Which covers one possibility? \n\nAlternatively? We can choose a word that doesn\'t put R at 1? But what for? \n\nFor example? Suppose R is at position 5? Then we might test different? But unknown? \n\nBut ROAST seems reasonable? \n\nAlso? We want to use common letters? O,S,T are common? \n\nHence? Guess ROAST? \n\nBut wait? In CRANE? We had R(-)? So R is present? But at wrong position? So if we put R at position 1? And if the actual R is at 1? Then ROAST first R: ✓? Or if R is at 5? Then we will see R at 1: (-) ? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nOne more point: The word ROAST? Does it contain any excluded? C,E,N? No? So good? \n\nSo I think ROAST is fine? \n\nAnother word: PLAN?T? Avoid N? So any word without C,E,N? And has A at 3? \n\nBut ROAST? Yes? \n\nSo in summary? Our next word: ROAST? \n\n<guess>ROAST</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- **C**, **N**, and **E** are not in the word (marked with ❌).\n- **A** is in the correct position (position 3, marked with ✓).\n- **R** is in the word but in the wrong position (marked with ➖, so it cannot be at position 2).\n\nWe know:\n- The secret word has **A** at position 3: `_ _ A _ _`.\n- **R** is present but not at position 2, so it must be at position 1, 4, or 5.\n- The word cannot contain **C**, **E**, or **N**.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- We want to keep **A** at position 3 to maintain the known correct letter.\n- To test the position of **R**, place it at position 1 to potentially gain immediate clarity if it is correct (✓) or to rule out that position if it gets ➖.\n- Test new common letters (like **O**, **S**, **T**) to cover more ground on unprobed letters.\n- Avoid using **C**, **E**, **N** as they are confirmed absent.\n\nA suitable word that fits these criteria is **ROAST**:\n- Position 3: **A** (confirmed correct).\n- Position 1: **R** (tests if **R** is at position 1).\n- Positions 2, 4, and 5: **O**, **S**, **T** — new letters not previously tested, all common and likely to provide useful feedback.\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for **R** (\'s position and explores three additional letters.\n\n<guess>ROAST</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ROAST -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(✓) S(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n**Guess 1: CRANE**\n- C: ❌ (not in word)\n- R: ➖ (in word, wrong position)\n- A: ✓ (correct position)\n- N: ❌ (not in word)\n- E: ❌ (not in word)\n\n**Guess 2: ROAST**\n- R: ➖ (in word, wrong position)\n- O: ❌ (not in word)\n- A: ✓ (correct position)\n- S: ➖ (in word, wrong position)\n- T: ❌ (not in word)\n\n**What we know:**\n1. The word has **A** in the **third position**: `_ _ A _ _`\n2. **R** is in the word, but not at position 2 (from first guess) and not at position 1 (from second guess, since R at position 1 got ➖, meaning it\'s not at position 1). Therefore, **R must be at position 4 or 5**.\n3. **S** is in the word, but not at position 4 (since it got ➖ in ROAST at position 4). So S is at position 1, 2, or 5? But note: positions 1,2,4,5 are available? Actually, position 3 is fixed as A, so S can be at 1,2,5? But we know it\'s not at 4? So positions 1,2,5 are possible for S? However, we don\'t know about position 2 yet? So S can be at 1,2, or 5? But we must avoid positions where it was already tried? Specifically, it was at position 4 and got ➖, so it\'s not at 4? But it could be elsewhere? Yes.\n\n4. **Excluded letters**: C, E, N, O, T are not in the word (all marked ❌ in either guess). So we must avoid: C, E, N, O, T.\n\n5. **Included letters**: R, A, S (A is fixed at position 3, R and S are present but positions unknown).\n\n**Positions for R and S:**\n- R: must be at position 4 or 5 (since not at 1 or 2? Actually, from first guess, R was at position 2 and got ➖, so not at 2. From second guess, R at position 1 got ➖, so not at 1. And position 3 is A, so R must be at 4 or 5).\n- S: was at position 4 in ROAST and got ➖, so not at 4. Therefore, S must be at position 1, 2, or 5? But note: if R is at 4 or 5, then S cannot be at the same position? Unless the word has duplicate letters? But we don\'t know? So we must consider the possibility of duplicates? However, to be safe, we should assume no duplicates unless forced? But we don\'t have evidence of duplicates? So let\'s assume no duplicates for now? Then S cannot be at 4 (already tried) and cannot be at 3 (A), so S must be at 1, 2, or 5? But if R is at 4 or 5, then S must be at 1 or 2? Because if R is at 4, then S can be at 1,2,5? But if R is at 5, then S can be at 1,2,4? But we know S is not at 4? So if R is at 5, then S can be at 1 or 2? Similarly, if R is at 4, then S can be at 1,2,5? But 5 is available? However, if R is at 4, then position 5 is free? So S could be at 5? But then we have two possibilities? \n\nBut we also have to consider that the word has 5 letters? And we know A at 3? And R and S? So we need to find two more letters? \n\n**Available letters:** We have used: C,R,A,N,E,O,S,T? And excluded: C,E,N,O,T? So available letters: all except C,E,N,O,T? So we can use: A,B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But A is already used? But we can use it again? But we don\'t know if duplicates? But we have A fixed? So we don\'t need to use A again? We are focusing on the other positions? \n\nBut we know the word has R and S? So we must include them? And we have two more letters? \n\nSo the word pattern: \n- Position 3: A\n- R at 4 or 5\n- S at 1,2, or 5? But if R is at 4, then S can be at 1,2,5? If R is at 5, then S can be at 1,2? \n\nBut we also need to avoid the excluded letters? \n\n**Strategy for next guess:**\n- We need to test the positions of R and S? And also test new common letters? \n- We know R is at 4 or 5? So we can try to put R at 4? Then if it\'s correct, we get ✓? Or if not, then R must be at 5? \n- Similarly, we can test S at a position? \n\nBut we have two unknowns? So we might need to choose a word that tests one of the possibilities? \n\nAlso, we must avoid O,T? Etc? \n\nLet me consider possible words? \n\nFirst, if R is at position 4: then pattern: `_ _ A R _`? \nThen S must be at 1,2, or 5? \n\nIf R is at position 5: then pattern: `_ _ A _ R`? \nThen S must be at 1 or 2? \n\nWe can try to assume R at 4? Then we can test a word with R at 4? \n\nFor example: \n- We can try a word with R at 4? And S at 1? Then we have: `S _ A R ?`? \n- What letter at position 2 and 5? We need to choose common letters? \n\nBut we must avoid C,E,N,O,T? \n\nSo for position 2: we can try a vowel? Like I? Or U? Or consonant? \n\nSimilarly, position 5: we can try a common consonant? \n\nBut we also want to test new letters? \n\nAlternatively, we can try to put S at position 1? And R at 4? Then we have: `S ? A R ?`? \n\nWhat words? Like: \n- SHARK? But H and K? But we haven\'t tested? But also, we must avoid E? But SHARK: S H A R K? Position 3 A? Then R at 4? Then K at 5? But we don\'t know about H and K? \n- But H and K are available? \n\nBut we also have to consider that if R is at 5? Then this word would be wrong? \n\nBut we are testing R at 4? \n\nSimilarly, we can try S at 2? Then `? S A R ?`? Like US?R? But USA?R? Not? \n\nAnother idea: we can try to use a word that has both R and S? And tests common letters? \n\nBut we must avoid O,T? \n\nLet me list possible words? \n\nWe know the word must have A at 3? And R and S? \n\nPossible patterns:\n\nCase 1: R at 4: then `_ _ A R _`? \n  - Then S can be at 1,2,5? \n  - If S at 1: `S _ A R ?`? \n      - Words: SHARD (but D? and H? and avoid E? SHARD: S H A R D? Avoid? C,E,N,O,T? So H,A,R,D? A and R are known? So H and D? \n      - Or SPARK? But P and K? \n  - If S at 2: `_ S A R ?`? \n      - Words: IS?R? Like ISARM? Not common? US?R? Like USURP? But U and P? \n  - If S at 5: `_ _ A R S`? \n      - Words: BAR?S? But avoid? Like BARKS? But K? And B? \n\nCase 2: R at 5: then `_ _ A _ R`? \n  - Then S must be at 1 or 2? \n  - If S at 1: `S _ A _ R`? \n      - Words: S?A?R? Like SAL?R? But avoid L? SALAR? But A repeated? And L? Or SAB?R? \n      - Common: SA?R? Like SABER? But E excluded? Or SAD?R? \n      - How about SAU?R? Like SAU?R? SAUCE? But C and E excluded? SAUNA? N excluded? \n      - So difficult? \n  - If S at 2: `_ S A _ R`? \n      - Words: ?S?A?R? Like US?AR? USA?R? But USA?R? Not? Or AS?AR? \n\nThis is getting messy? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that tests R at 4? And also tests S at a position? And uses common letters? \n\nWe also need to test for the other letters? \n\nAnother idea: we can try to put S at position 1? And R at position 5? Then we have: `S _ A _ R`? \n\nThen we need two letters? For position 2 and 4? \n\nWe must avoid C,E,N,O,T? \n\nSo for position 2: we can try a vowel? Like I? Or U? Or consonant? \n\nFor position 4: we can try a consonant? \n\nBut we want common words? \n\nPossible words: \n- SH?A?R? Like SH?R? But SHIRE? H,I,R,E? But E excluded? \n- SH?R? Without E? \n- SHARK?

But P? And R at 4? Not 5? \n\nPerhaps we should consider that R might be at 4? \n\nLet me try to find words with R at 4? And S at 1? \n\nPattern: `S _ A R ?`? \n\nWords: \n- SHARK: S H A R K? \n- SHARD: S H A R D? \n- SNARL? But N excluded? \n- SPARK: S P A R K? \n- STARK: S T A R K? But T excluded? \n- SWARM: S W A R M? \n\nSo possible: SHARK, SHARD, SPARK, SWARM? \n\nBut we must avoid T? So STARK is out? \n\nNow, SHARK: uses H and K? \nSHARD: uses H and D? \nSPARK: uses P and K? \nSWARM: uses W and M? \n\nAll avoid C,E,N,O,T? \n\nSimilarly, we can try S at 2? Pattern: `_ S A R ?`? \n\nWords: \n- US?AR? Like USHAR? Not? \n- IS?AR? Like ISHAR? Not? \n- AS?AR? ASHAR? Not? \n- PS?AR? Not? \n- WS?AR? Not? \n\nNot common? \n\nOr S at 5?

And we want to test common letters? \n\nAlso, we haven\'t tested H, P, K, D, W, M? \n\nWe can choose SHARK? But it has K? \n\nOr SPARK? \n\nBut note: in SHARK, if we guess it, and if R is actually at 5? Then we will get feedback that R is not at 4? And then we know R must be at 5? \n\nSimilarly, if we guess SHARK: \n- S at 1: if S is at 1, then ✓? Or if not, then ➖? \n- H at 2: we don\'t know? \n- A at 3: ✓ \n- R at 4: we test if R is at 4? \n- K at 5: we don\'t know? \n\nBut if the actual word has R at 5? Then in SHARK, R at 4 will be ➖? And we will know R is at 5? \n\nSimilarly, if S is not at 1? Then we get ➖ for S? And then S must be at 2? \n\nBut we don\'t have many options? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that tests S at position 2? But we couldn\'t find common words? \n\nSo let\'s go with SHARK? \n\nBut we must avoid C,E,N,O,T? SHARK does that? \n\nAnother word: SWARM? S W A R M? \n\nBut we don\'t know W and M? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nI think SHARK is a good choice? \n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get? \n\nWe can also consider that we have only 4 guesses left? \n\nBut we need to make a guess? \n\nAnother idea: we can try to put R at 5? And S at 1? But we couldn\'t find a common word? \n\nWhat about ""SIR?R"" but not? \n\nOr ""SUR?R"" like SURER? But E excluded? \n\nSo not? \n\nTherefore, I think we should try SHARK? \n\nBut let\'s list the possibilities? \n\nThe secret word must have:\n- A at 3\n- R at 4 or 5\n- S at 1,2, or 5? But if R is at 4, then S at 1,2,5?

Thus, `R` must be at **position 4 or 5**.\n   - `S` is in the word but cannot be at position 4 (➖ in ROAST). Thus, `S` must be at **position 1, 2, or 5**.\n3. **Absent letters**: `C`, `E`, `N`, `O`, `T` are excluded (❌ in either guess). Avoid using these.\n4. **Constraints**:\n   - Position 3 is fixed as `A`.\n   - `R` and `S` must be included, but their positions are uncertain.\n   - The word has no duplicates (no feedback suggests duplicates, so we assume none for now).\n   - Available letters: Focus on untested common consonants (e.g., `B`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `I`, `K`, `L`, `M`, `P`, `U`, `W`, `Y`) and vowels (`I`, `U`).\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- **Test `R` at position 4**: If correct, we get ✓; if ➖, `R` must be at position 5.\n- **Test `S` at position 1**: If correct, we get ✓; if ➖, `S` must be at position 2 or 5 (but position 5 may conflict with `R`).\n- **Prioritize high-frequency letters**: Include `H` (common consonant) and `K` (common ending letter) to maximize information.\n- **Avoid excluded letters**: No `C`, `E`, `N`, `O`, `T`.\n\n**Chosen word: SHARK**  \n- `S` at position 1 (tests if `S` is at position 1).\n- `H` at position 2 (new untested letter).\n- `A` at position 3 (confirmed correct).\n- `R` at position 4 (tests if `R` is at position 4).\n- `K` at position 5 (new untested letter).\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down the positions of `R` and `S` while probing two new common letters (`H`, `K`). If `R` is not at position 4, it must be at 5, and if `S` is not at 1, it must be at 2 (since position 4 is ruled out and position 5 may be occupied by `R`).\n\n<guess>SHARK</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ROAST -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(✓) S(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: SHARK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) A(✓) R(✓) K(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from Guess 3: SHARK -> S(✓) H(x) A(✓) R(✓) K(✓)

This means:
- S is in the correct position (position 1): So the word starts with S.
- A is in the correct position (position 3).
- R is in the correct position (position 4).
- K is in the correct position (position 5).
- H is not in the word (x).

Moreover, from previous feedback:
- We know the word is of the form S _ A R K, since positions 1,3,4,5 are correct: S (position 1), A (position 3), R (position 4), K (position 5).
- The only unknown is position 2.

We also know from previous feedback that the word does not contain: C, E, N, O, T (from earlier x's), and now also H is absent.

So the word is: Position 1: S, Position 2: ?, Position 3: A, Position 4: R, Position 5: K -> ""S?ARK""

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form S_ARK, excluding the letters: C, E, N, O, T, H.

Possible letters for position 2: Any letter except the excluded ones (C, E, N, O, T, H) and we should consider common English words.

Common words ending with ""ARK"":
- SHARK: But H is excluded (x in feedback), so not.
- STARK: But T is excluded (from guess 2: T x), so not.
- SNARK: N excluded (from guess 1: N x), so not.
- SPARK: P is not excluded? We haven't tested P. But SPARK is a word? Yes.

What about:
- SPARK: S P A R K -> P is not excluded? We haven't used P before, and it hasn't been marked absent. Similarly, is P a possible letter?

Other possibilities:
- SWARK? Not a common word.
- SMARK? Not a word.
- SCARK? C excluded.
- SEARK? E excluded.
- SNARK? N excluded.
- SOARK? O excluded.
- STARK? T excluded.

So SPARK seems a candidate? But we have to check for exclusion? We haven't guessed P? So it might be present.

But also, are there other words?
- BOARD? But we know the form? It must be S_ARK? So SPARK is one.

What about CLARK? But C excluded and pattern must start with S? Not.

JARK? Not? Etc.

So the most common word fitting is SPARK? But we haven't tried P? So it might be.

Another word: PARK? But we need S at the start? So only SPARK and perhaps others? But SPARK is the most likely.

Also, we must ensure that P is not in the excluded list? Excluded letters: C, E, N, O, T, H. P is not among these? So yes.

Therefore, the word must be SPARK.

But let's confirm: S P A R K -> matches all positions? And we haven't excluded P? Also, H is excluded? But SPARK doesn't have H? So no problem.

Moreover, we have 6 tries? But this might be it.

So our next guess: SPARK? Actually, we should guess SPARK? Because based on the feedback, the only unknown is position 2? And SPARK is a word? And P hasn't been tried? And not excluded? So we can guess SPARK? Then if it's correct? Or it might be another word? But common English words? SPARK is the only common one I recall? 

SMARK? No? SWARK? Rare? Not common. So SPARK is the probable word.

Therefore, we guess SPARK.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Previous Feedback Summary**:
   - **C**: Excluded (❌ from CRANE).
   - **E**: Excluded (❌ from CRANE).
   - **N**: Excluded (❌ from CRANE).
   - **O**: Excluded (❌ from ROAST).
   - **T**: Excluded (❌ from ROAST).
   - **H**: Excluded (❌ from SHARK).
   - **Confirmed Letters**:
     - **S**: Present and at position 1 (✓ in SHARK).
     - **A**: Present and at position 3 (✓ in all guesses).
     - **R**: Present and at position 4 (✓ in SHARK).
     - **K**: Present and at position 5 (✓ in SHARK).
     - **R** is also confirmed present but not at positions 1 or 2 (➖ in earlier guesses).

2. **Word Structure**:
   - Feedback from SHARK (S✓ H❌ A✓ R✓ K✓) reveals the word is exactly:
     - Position 1: **S**
     - Position 2: **?** (unknown letter, but not H and not excluded)
     - Position 3: **A**
     - Position 4: **R**
     - Position 5: **K**
   - The word pattern is **S_ARK**, where only position 2 is unknown.

3. **Excluded Letters**:
   - **C, E, N, O, T, H** are all absent (❌ in previous feedback).
   - P is not excluded or tested, so it must be considered.

4. **Possible Letters for Position 2**:
   - Must be an English letter not in the excluded list (e.g., not C/E/N/O/T/H).
   - Common options: **B, D, F, G, I, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.
   - However, only letters forming valid English words are viable. The most common 5-letter word matching **S_ARK** is **SPARK** (with **P**).
   - Other rare/obscure words like ""SMARK"" or ""SWARK"" exist but are uncommon. **SPARK** is the highest-probability candidate based on English word frequency.

5. **Why SPARK?**:
   - Tests the only unknown position (position 2) with a high-frequency consonant (**P**).
   - If correct, confirms the word. If incorrect, rules out **P** and provides information for position 2.
   - No contradictions: **P** is untested, not excluded, and fits the pattern.

<guess>SPARK</guess>",SPARK,"We have feedback from Guess 3: SHARK -> S(✓) H(x) A(✓) R(✓) K(✓)

This means:
- S is in the correct position (position 1): So the word starts with S.
- A is in the correct position (position 3).
- R is in the correct position (position 4).
- K is in the correct position (position 5).
- H is not in the word (x).

Moreover, from previous feedback:
- We know the word is of the form S _ A R K, since positions 1,3,4,5 are correct: S (position 1), A (position 3), R (position 4), K (position 5).
- The only unknown is position 2.

We also know from previous feedback that the word does not contain: C, E, N, O, T (from earlier x's), and now also H is absent.

So the word is: Position 1: S, Position 2: ?, Position 3: A, Position 4: R, Position 5: K -> ""S?ARK""

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form S_ARK, excluding the letters: C, E, N, O, T, H.

Possible letters for position 2: Any letter except the excluded ones (C, E, N, O, T, H) and we should consider common English words.

Common words ending with ""ARK"":
- SHARK: But H is excluded (x in feedback), so not.
- STARK: But T is excluded (from guess 2: T x), so not.
- SNARK: N excluded (from guess 1: N x), so not.
- SPARK: P is not excluded? We haven't tested P. But SPARK is a word? Yes.

What about:
- SPARK: S P A R K -> P is not excluded? We haven't used P before, and it hasn't been marked absent. Similarly, is P a possible letter?

Other possibilities:
- SWARK? Not a common word.
- SMARK? Not a word.
- SCARK? C excluded.
- SEARK? E excluded.
- SNARK? N excluded.
- SOARK? O excluded.
- STARK? T excluded.

So SPARK seems a candidate? But we have to check for exclusion? We haven't guessed P? So it might be present.

But also, are there other words?
- BOARD? But we know the form? It must be S_ARK? So SPARK is one.

What about CLARK? But C excluded and pattern must start with S? Not.

JARK? Not? Etc.

So the most common word fitting is SPARK? But we haven't tried P? So it might be.

Another word: PARK? But we need S at the start? So only SPARK and perhaps others? But SPARK is the most likely.

Also, we must ensure that P is not in the excluded list? Excluded letters: C, E, N, O, T, H. P is not among these? So yes.

Therefore, the word must be SPARK.

But let's confirm: S P A R K -> matches all positions? And we haven't excluded P? Also, H is excluded? But SPARK doesn't have H? So no problem.

Moreover, we have 6 tries? But this might be it.

So our next guess: SPARK? Actually, we should guess SPARK? Because based on the feedback, the only unknown is position 2? And SPARK is a word? And P hasn't been tried? And not excluded? So we can guess SPARK? Then if it's correct? Or it might be another word? But common English words? SPARK is the only common one I recall? 

SMARK? No? SWARK? Rare? Not common. So SPARK is the probable word.

Therefore, we guess SPARK.

<guess>SPARK</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Previous Feedback Summary**:
   - **C**: Excluded (❌ from CRANE).
   - **E**: Excluded (❌ from CRANE).
   - **N**: Excluded (❌ from CRANE).
   - **O**: Excluded (❌ from ROAST).
   - **T**: Excluded (❌ from ROAST).
   - **H**: Excluded (❌ from SHARK).
   - **Confirmed Letters**:
     - **S**: Present and at position 1 (✓ in SHARK).
     - **A**: Present and at position 3 (✓ in all guesses).
     - **R**: Present and at position 4 (✓ in SHARK).
     - **K**: Present and at position 5 (✓ in SHARK).
     - **R** is also confirmed present but not at positions 1 or 2 (➖ in earlier guesses).

2. **Word Structure**:
   - Feedback from SHARK (S✓ H❌ A✓ R✓ K✓) reveals the word is exactly:
     - Position 1: **S**
     - Position 2: **?** (unknown letter, but not H and not excluded)
     - Position 3: **A**
     - Position 4: **R**
     - Position 5: **K**
   - The word pattern is **S_ARK**, where only position 2 is unknown.

3. **Excluded Letters**:
   - **C, E, N, O, T, H** are all absent (❌ in previous feedback).
   - P is not excluded or tested, so it must be considered.

4. **Possible Letters for Position 2**:
   - Must be an English letter not in the excluded list (e.g., not C/E/N/O/T/H).
   - Common options: **B, D, F, G, I, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.
   - However, only letters forming valid English words are viable. The most common 5-letter word matching **S_ARK** is **SPARK** (with **P**).
   - Other rare/obscure words like ""SMARK"" or ""SWARK"" exist but are uncommon. **SPARK** is the highest-probability candidate based on English word frequency.

5. **Why SPARK?**:
   - Tests the only unknown position (position 2) with a high-frequency consonant (**P**).
   - If correct, confirms the word. If incorrect, rules out **P** and provides information for position 2.
   - No contradictions: **P** is untested, not excluded, and fits the pattern.",Guess 4: SPARK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(✓) A(✓) R(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
