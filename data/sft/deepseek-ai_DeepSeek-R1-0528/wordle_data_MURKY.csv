We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We can choose a word that covers frequent letters.

 Let's consider the frequency of letters in 5-letter English words. According to various sources, the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc.

 A popular starting word is ""ROATE"" (which means the accumulated wealth) but it's not very common. Another is ""RAISE"".

 Alternatively, we can use ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E — all common letters.

 But note: we are allowed only 5-letter words. We must choose a valid word.

 I think ""CRANE"" is a good first guess because:
   - It has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N).
   - The letters C, R, A, N, E are all in the top 10 most common letters.

 However, let me check if ""CRANE"" is a valid word? Yes, it means a large bird or a type of machine.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good one: S, L, A, T, E.

 But I'll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

We have feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
 Interpretation:
   - 'C' is not in the secret word.
   - 'R' is in the word but in the wrong position.
   - 'A' is not in the word.
   - 'N' is not in the word.
   - 'E' is not in the word.

 So, we know:
   - The secret word contains the letter 'R', but not in the second position (since in CRANE it was in position 2 and it's marked wrong).
   - The letters C, A, N, E are absent.

 We also know that the secret word must be a 5-letter word and include 'R'.

 We must avoid using any of the letters C, A, N, E in our next guess because they are not in the word.

 Since we only have one letter known (R) and it's not in position 2, let's think of a new word that includes 'R' but in a different position, and avoids C, A, N, E.

 We have 5 positions: 1 2 3 4 5

 Our next guess should have 'R' in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5 (because position 2 was wrong).

 Also, we want to maximize information by using new letters so that we can cover more of the alphabet.

 Let's think about what letters to use. We should avoid the eliminated letters: C, A, N, E.

 Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since 'R' is the only known letter present, we should form a word with 'R' and four other new letters.

 We can try to choose letters that are frequent. For example, common vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out). We should try to include vowels.

 Let's try to form a word that:
   - Contains 'R'
   - Does not contain C, A, N, E
   - Includes at least one vowel (like I, O, U) and other consonants.

 Potential words:
   - ""ROTLS"" is not a word.
   - ""ROUST"" - valid? (meaning: to disturb or to drive out) - let me check: it's valid.

 But note: we have to make sure the word is valid.

 However, we must also consider that 'R' is not in position 2. So in the word we choose, we can put 'R' in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 For more information, we could put 'R' in position 1? But we don't know. Alternatively, we can try a word that has 'R' in a different position than 2.

 Let me think of common words:
   - ""SPRIT"" - not valid? (it might be a rare word but let me skip)
   - ""FIRST""? But note: we have A? no, A is eliminated. ""FIRST"" has A? No, it doesn't: F-I-R-S-T. But we don't know the frequency.

 However, ""FIRST"" uses the letter I and S, T. Also, it doesn't contain A? Actually, it doesn't. But we must avoid E and we have no E.

 But wait: our eliminated letters are C, A, N, E. ""FIRST"" has none of these. And it has 'R' in the third position (position 3). That's different from position 2.

 So, ""FIRST"": 
   - Position 1: F
   - Position 2: I
   - Position 3: R
   - Position 4: S
   - Position 5: T

 This could be a good candidate because we get to check F, I, S, T and also R (in position 3).

 Alternative: ""ROUST"" - R in position 1? That might be good too but let's compare.

 We want to cover more common letters. Letters like S and T are very common.

 So, ""FIRST"" is a valid English word.

 However, note that the feedback from the first guess showed that R is not in position 2. In ""FIRST"", R is in position 3. So that's allowed.

 But we don't know if R might be in position 1 or elsewhere. However, if we put R in position 1 and it's actually there, we would get a check. But putting it in a new position might be better.

 Another candidate: ""SPORT"" - has S, P, O, R, T. But O is a vowel. And R is at position 4.

 However, I think ""FIRST"" is a solid second guess.

 Let me choose ""FIRST"".

 But wait: we haven't eliminated I, S, T. So yes.

 So, next guess: ""FIRST""

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":

- R (➖) is present but **not in position 2**.

For my next guess:
- I must exclude C, A, N, E entirely.
- I must include R, but **not in position 2**.
- I chose ""first"" because:
  - It places R in position 3 (avoiding position 2).
  - It tests new common letters: F, I, S, T.
  - As a valid 5-letter word, it balances vowel/consonant coverage (I is a vowel).

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.\n Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We can choose a word that covers frequent letters.\n\n Let\'s consider the frequency of letters in 5-letter English words. According to various sources, the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc.\n\n A popular starting word is ""ROATE"" (which means the accumulated wealth) but it\'s not very common. Another is ""RAISE"".\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E — all common letters.\n\n But note: we are allowed only 5-letter words. We must choose a valid word.\n\n I think ""CRANE"" is a good first guess because:\n   - It has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N).\n   - The letters C, R, A, N, E are all in the top 10 most common letters.\n\n However, let me check if ""CRANE"" is a valid word? Yes, it means a large bird or a type of machine.\n\n Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good one: S, L, A, T, E.\n\n But I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.\n\n So, my first guess is: CRANE\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n Interpretation:\n   - \'C\' is not in the secret word.\n   - \'R\' is in the word but in the wrong position.\n   - \'A\' is not in the word.\n   - \'N\' is not in the word.\n   - \'E\' is not in the word.\n\n So, we know:\n   - The secret word contains the letter \'R\', but not in the second position (since in CRANE it was in position 2 and it\'s marked wrong).\n   - The letters C, A, N, E are absent.\n\n We also know that the secret word must be a 5-letter word and include \'R\'.\n\n We must avoid using any of the letters C, A, N, E in our next guess because they are not in the word.\n\n Since we only have one letter known (R) and it\'s not in position 2, let\'s think of a new word that includes \'R\' but in a different position, and avoids C, A, N, E.\n\n We have 5 positions: 1 2 3 4 5\n\n Our next guess should have \'R\' in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5 (because position 2 was wrong).\n\n Also, we want to maximize information by using new letters so that we can cover more of the alphabet.\n\n Let\'s think about what letters to use. We should avoid the eliminated letters: C, A, N, E.\n\n Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n Since \'R\' is the only known letter present, we should form a word with \'R\' and four other new letters.\n\n We can try to choose letters that are frequent. For example, common vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out). We should try to include vowels.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that:\n   - Contains \'R\'\n   - Does not contain C, A, N, E\n   - Includes at least one vowel (like I, O, U) and other consonants.\n\n Potential words:\n   - ""ROTLS"" is not a word.\n   - ""ROUST"" - valid? (meaning: to disturb or to drive out) - let me check: it\'s valid.\n\n But note: we have to make sure the word is valid.\n\n However, we must also consider that \'R\' is not in position 2. So in the word we choose, we can put \'R\' in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n For more information, we could put \'R\' in position 1? But we don\'t know. Alternatively, we can try a word that has \'R\' in a different position than 2.\n\n Let me think of common words:\n   - ""SPRIT"" - not valid? (it might be a rare word but let me skip)\n   - ""FIRST""? But note: we have A? no, A is eliminated. ""FIRST"" has A? No, it doesn\'t: F-I-R-S-T. But we don\'t know the frequency.\n\n However, ""FIRST"" uses the letter I and S, T. Also, it doesn\'t contain A? Actually, it doesn\'t. But we must avoid E and we have no E.\n\n But wait: our eliminated letters are C, A, N, E. ""FIRST"" has none of these. And it has \'R\' in the third position (position 3). That\'s different from position 2.\n\n So, ""FIRST"": \n   - Position 1: F\n   - Position 2: I\n   - Position 3: R\n   - Position 4: S\n   - Position 5: T\n\n This could be a good candidate because we get to check F, I, S, T and also R (in position 3).\n\n Alternative: ""ROUST"" - R in position 1? That might be good too but let\'s compare.\n\n We want to cover more common letters. Letters like S and T are very common.\n\n So, ""FIRST"" is a valid English word.\n\n However, note that the feedback from the first guess showed that R is not in position 2. In ""FIRST"", R is in position 3. So that\'s allowed.\n\n But we don\'t know if R might be in position 1 or elsewhere. However, if we put R in position 1 and it\'s actually there, we would get a check. But putting it in a new position might be better.\n\n Another candidate: ""SPORT"" - has S, P, O, R, T. But O is a vowel. And R is at position 4.\n\n However, I think ""FIRST"" is a solid second guess.\n\n Let me choose ""FIRST"".\n\n But wait: we haven\'t eliminated I, S, T.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
  C: absent (x)
  R: present, wrong position (-)
  A: absent (x)
  N: absent (x)
  E: absent (x)

Guess 2: FIRST
  F: absent (x)
  I: absent (x)
  R: correct position (✓) - so R is in position 3 of the secret word.
  S: absent (x)
  T: absent (x)

So, what do we know?
- The secret word has the letter R in the third position (position 3).
- The letters C, A, N, E, F, I, S, T are all absent. (That is, they are not in the word at all.)

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ R _ _

And the absent letters are: C, A, N, E, F, I, S, T.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Has R in the third position.
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, A, N, E, F, I, S, T.

What letters are left? Let's list the alphabet and remove the absent ones.

Alphabet: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Absent: A, C, E, F, I, N, S, T

So, available letters: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: R is already known and must be in position 3. So for the other positions, we can use any of the available letters.

We need to form a word that has R in the middle and uses only the available letters.

We also want to maximize information, so we should try to use common letters and cover multiple possibilities.

Common letters from the available set: B, D, G, H, L, M, O, P, U, Y (for example).

We should try to include vowels because we haven't found any vowel yet. The available vowels are O, U, and sometimes Y.

So, we can try to form a word that has O or U or both.

Possible words:

- Let's try words with R in the third position.

Pattern: _ _ R _ _

We need to fill positions 1,2,4,5 with letters from B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and avoid the absent ones).

Some ideas:

- ""BROWN"": B, R, O, W, N -> but N is absent (from guess1), so invalid.
- ""CROWD"": C is absent -> invalid.
- ""GROUP"": G, R, O, U, P -> G, O, U, P are available? 
  - G: available
  - O: available
  - U: available
  - P: available
  - R: in position 3? 
  - The word ""GROUP"": 
      Position 1: G
      Position 2: R -> but we need R in position 3? In ""GROUP"", R is in position 2. We need R in position 3. So this doesn't work.

We must have R in position 3.

So, let's think of words with R in the third position.

Examples:

- ""WORDY"": W, O, R, D, Y -> 
  - W: available
  - O: available
  - R: in position 3? 
      Position 1: W
      Position 2: O
      Position 3: R -> yes, that's position 3.
      Position 4: D
      Position 5: Y
  - Check letters: W, O, R, D, Y. All are available? 
      W: yes
      O: yes
      R: known
      D: yes
      Y: yes
  - But is ""WORDY"" a valid word? Yes, meaning using too many words.

- ""MOURN"": M, O, U, R, N -> but N is absent (from guess1). Invalid.

- ""BORED"": B, O, R, E, D -> E is absent. Invalid.

- ""HORDE"": H, O, R, D, E -> E absent. Invalid.

- ""PROUD"": P, R, O, U, D -> but in ""PROUD"", R is in position 2? 
  Position 1: P
  Position 2: R -> we need R in position 3, so not.

We need R in position 3.

Another one: ""GROWL"": G, R, O, W, L -> R is in position 2? No, position 2.

What about ""QUORUM""? Too long, 6 letters.

Let me think of 5-letter words with R in the third position.

- ""ABOUT"": but A is absent and R not present.

- How about ""DOUBT"": D, O, U, B, T -> T is absent (from guess2). Invalid.

- ""JUMBO"": no R.

- ""PLUMB"": no R.

- ""BLURB"": B, L, U, R, B -> 
  Position 1: B
  Position 2: L
  Position 3: U? -> no, R is in position 4? 
  Actually: B-L-U-R-B -> so R is in position 4. We need position 3.

- ""CURRY"": C absent and R in position 3? C-U-R-R-Y -> position 3 is R? 
  Position 1: C (absent, invalid)
  Position 2: U
  Position 3: R -> yes, but C is absent so invalid.

We need to avoid absent letters.

Another idea: ""MORPH"": M, O, R, P, H -> 
  Position 1: M
  Position 2: O
  Position 3: R -> perfect.
  Position 4: P
  Position 5: H

Letters: M, O, R, P, H. 
- M: available
- O: available
- R: known
- P: available
- H: available

And ""MORPH"" is a valid word (meaning to change form).

This seems good.

Another possibility: ""YOURS"": Y, O, U, R, S -> but S is absent (from guess2). Invalid.

""DOZER"": D, O, Z, E, R -> E absent and R is in position 5? Not position 3.

""BOXER"": B, O, X, E, R -> E absent and R in position 5.

""LOVER"": L, O, V, E, R -> E absent.

""POWER"": P, O, W, E, R -> E absent.

""ROWER"": R in position 1? Not.

We need R in position 3.

""BROOD"": B, R, O, O, D -> R in position 2? Not.

""GROWL"": R in position 2.

""CRUMB"": C absent.

""DRUMB"" is not a word.

""DRUID"": D, R, U, I, D -> but I is absent (from guess2). Invalid.

""GRUMP"": G, R, U, M, P -> R in position 2? Not.

""WRONG"": W, R, O, N, G -> N absent.

""BROWN"": N absent.

""PROWL"": P, R, O, W, L -> R in position 2.

I think ""MORPH"" is a good candidate.

Another one: ""GOURD"": G, O, U, R, D -> 
  Position 1: G
  Position 2: O
  Position 3: U? -> no, R is in position 4? 
  G-O-U-R-D -> R is position 4. Not 3.

""WORLD"": W, O, R, L, D -> 
  Position 1: W
  Position 2: O
  Position 3: R -> perfect.
  Position 4: L
  Position 5: D

Letters: W, O, R, L, D. 
- W: available
- O: available
- R: known
- L: available
- D: available

And ""WORLD"" is a valid word.

So we have two candidates: ""MORPH"" and ""WORLD"".

Which one to choose? Both are valid and use available letters.

We want to cover more new letters. Let's compare:

- ""MORPH"" uses: M, O, R, P, H
- ""WORLD"" uses: W, O, R, L, D

We haven't tried M, P, H, W, L, D. Both are good.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3. We need to find the word.

Also, we don't have any vowel yet except that O and U are available. In ""MORPH"" we have O, and in ""WORLD"" we have O. So both have one vowel.

I think either is fine. Let's choose ""WORLD"" because it has more common letters? Or ""MORPH"" because it has less common letters? Actually, both are reasonable.

But let me see: we know R is in position 3, and we have no other information. So we need to test as many new letters as possible.

In ""WORLD"", we test W, O, L, D (and R is known).
In ""MORPH"", we test M, O, P, H.

The frequency of the letters in the available set: 
Common consonants: L, D, M, P, H, W, etc.

But L and D are more common than P and H? 

According to English letter frequency, the order is: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, D, L, U, ... 

But we have eliminated many, so among available: 
O is common, then H, D, L, U, etc.

But we are not using U in either.

So both are similar.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses U to check that vowel.

For example, ""MOURN"" is invalid because of N.

""COURT"": C absent.

""POURS"": P, O, U, R, S -> but S absent and R in position 4? Not.

""DOUGH"": D, O, U, G, H -> no R.

""GOURD"": R in position 4.

""ROUND"": R in position 1? Not.

""FJORD"": F absent and R in position 3? F-J-O-R-D -> position 3 is O? Not R.

""WORD"" is 4 letters.

I think ""WORLD"" or ""MORPH"" are fine.

Let me pick ""WORLD"" because it's a very common word.

So, next guess: WORLD

But note: we must avoid the absent letters. ""WORLD"" has no C, A, N, E, F, I, S, T. So it's safe.

Therefore, I'll go with ""WORLD"".

</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C (absent ✗), R (present but wrong position ➖), A (absent ✗), N (absent ✗), E (absent ✗).  
- **Guess 2 (FIRST)**: F (absent ✗), I (absent ✗), R (correct position ✓), S (absent ✗), T (absent ✗).  

### Key Insights:
1. **R is in the secret word and must be in position 3** (since it was correct in position 3 of ""FIRST"").
2. **Absent letters (cannot be in the word)**: C, A, N, E, F, I, S, T.  
3. **Available letters**: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since R is already placed).  
4. The secret word pattern is: `_ _ R _ _`.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Must include R in position 3** to maintain the known correct position.  
- **Use only available letters** (avoid absent letters).  
- **Maximize information** by testing new common letters and vowels (e.g., O, U, Y) to narrow down possibilities.  
- **Valid word candidates**: After evaluating options like ""MORPH"" and ""WORLD"", ""WORLD"" was chosen because:  
  - It fits the pattern `_ _ R _ _` with R in position 3.  
  - It uses new, common letters (W, O, L, D) that are high-frequency and cover both vowels (O) and consonants.  
  - It is a valid 5-letter English word.  

<guess>world</guess>",world,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
  C: absent (x)
  R: present, wrong position (-)
  A: absent (x)
  N: absent (x)
  E: absent (x)

Guess 2: FIRST
  F: absent (x)
  I: absent (x)
  R: correct position (✓) - so R is in position 3 of the secret word.
  S: absent (x)
  T: absent (x)

So, what do we know?
- The secret word has the letter R in the third position (position 3).
- The letters C, A, N, E, F, I, S, T are all absent. (That is, they are not in the word at all.)

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ R _ _

And the absent letters are: C, A, N, E, F, I, S, T.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Has R in the third position.
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, A, N, E, F, I, S, T.

What letters are left? Let's list the alphabet and remove the absent ones.

Alphabet: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Absent: A, C, E, F, I, N, S, T

So, available letters: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: R is already known and must be in position 3. So for the other positions, we can use any of the available letters.

We need to form a word that has R in the middle and uses only the available letters.

We also want to maximize information, so we should try to use common letters and cover multiple possibilities.

Common letters from the available set: B, D, G, H, L, M, O, P, U, Y (for example).

We should try to include vowels because we haven't found any vowel yet. The available vowels are O, U, and sometimes Y.

So, we can try to form a word that has O or U or both.

Possible words:

- Let's try words with R in the third position.

Pattern: _ _ R _ _

We need to fill positions 1,2,4,5 with letters from B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and avoid the absent ones).

Some ideas:

- ""BROWN"": B, R, O, W, N -> but N is absent (from guess1), so invalid.
- ""CROWD"": C is absent -> invalid.
- ""GROUP"": G, R, O, U, P -> G, O, U, P are available? 
  - G: available
  - O: available
  - U: available
  - P: available
  - R: in position 3? 
  - The word ""GROUP"": 
      Position 1: G
      Position 2: R -> but we need R in position 3? In ""GROUP"", R is in position 2. We need R in position 3. So this doesn't work.

We must have R in position 3.

So, let's think of words with R in the third position.

Examples:

- ""WORDY"": W, O, R, D, Y -> 
  - W: available
  - O: available
  - R: in position 3? 
      Position 1: W
      Position 2: O
      Position 3: R -> yes, that's position 3.
      Position 4: D
      Position 5: Y
  - Check letters: W, O, R, D, Y. All are available? 
      W: yes
      O: yes
      R: known
      D: yes
      Y: yes
  - But is ""WORDY"" a valid word? Yes, meaning using too many words.

- ""MOURN"": M, O, U, R, N -> but N is absent (from guess1). Invalid.

- ""BORED"": B, O, R, E, D -> E is absent. Invalid.

- ""HORDE"": H, O, R, D, E -> E absent. Invalid.

- ""PROUD"": P, R, O, U, D -> but in ""PROUD"", R is in position 2? 
  Position 1: P
  Position 2: R -> we need R in position 3, so not.

We need R in position 3.

Another one: ""GROWL"": G, R, O, W, L -> R is in position 2? No, position 2.

What about ""QUORUM""? Too long, 6 letters.

Let me think of 5-letter words with R in the third position.

- ""ABOUT"": but A is absent and R not present.

- How about ""DOUBT"": D, O, U, B, T -> T is absent (from guess2). Invalid.

- ""JUMBO"": no R.

- ""PLUMB"": no R.

- ""BLURB"": B, L, U, R, B -> 
  Position 1: B
  Position 2: L
  Position 3: U? -> no, R is in position 4? 
  Actually: B-L-U-R-B -> so R is in position 4. We need position 3.

- ""CURRY"": C absent and R in position 3? C-U-R-R-Y -> position 3 is R? 
  Position 1: C (absent, invalid)
  Position 2: U
  Position 3: R -> yes, but C is absent so invalid.

We need to avoid absent letters.

Another idea: ""MORPH"": M, O, R, P, H -> 
  Position 1: M
  Position 2: O
  Position 3: R -> perfect.
  Position 4: P
  Position 5: H

Letters: M, O, R, P, H. 
- M: available
- O: available
- R: known
- P: available
- H: available

And ""MORPH"" is a valid word (meaning to change form).

This seems good.

Another possibility: ""YOURS"": Y, O, U, R, S -> but S is absent (from guess2). Invalid.

""DOZER"": D, O, Z, E, R -> E absent and R is in position 5? Not position 3.

""BOXER"": B, O, X, E, R -> E absent and R in position 5.

""LOVER"": L, O, V, E, R -> E absent.

""POWER"": P, O, W, E, R -> E absent.

""ROWER"": R in position 1? Not.

We need R in position 3.

""BROOD"": B, R, O, O, D -> R in position 2? Not.

""GROWL"": R in position 2.

""CRUMB"": C absent.

""DRUMB"" is not a word.

""DRUID"": D, R, U, I, D -> but I is absent (from guess2). Invalid.

""GRUMP"": G, R, U, M, P -> R in position 2? Not.

""WRONG"": W, R, O, N, G -> N absent.

""BROWN"": N absent.

""PROWL"": P, R, O, W, L -> R in position 2.

I think ""MORPH"" is a good candidate.

Another one: ""GOURD"": G, O, U, R, D -> 
  Position 1: G
  Position 2: O
  Position 3: U? -> no, R is in position 4? 
  G-O-U-R-D -> R is position 4. Not 3.

""WORLD"": W, O, R, L, D -> 
  Position 1: W
  Position 2: O
  Position 3: R -> perfect.
  Position 4: L
  Position 5: D

Letters: W, O, R, L, D. 
- W: available
- O: available
- R: known
- L: available
- D: available

And ""WORLD"" is a valid word.

So we have two candidates: ""MORPH"" and ""WORLD"".

Which one to choose? Both are valid and use available letters.

We want to cover more new letters. Let's compare:

- ""MORPH"" uses: M, O, R, P, H
- ""WORLD"" uses: W, O, R, L, D

We haven't tried M, P, H, W, L, D. Both are good.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3. We need to find the word.

Also, we don't have any vowel yet except that O and U are available. In ""MORPH"" we have O, and in ""WORLD"" we have O. So both have one vowel.

I think either is fine. Let's choose ""WORLD"" because it has more common letters? Or ""MORPH"" because it has less common letters? Actually, both are reasonable.

But let me see: we know R is in position 3, and we have no other information. So we need to test as many new letters as possible.

In ""WORLD"", we test W, O, L, D (and R is known).
In ""MORPH"", we test M, O, P, H.

The frequency of the letters in the available set: 
Common consonants: L, D, M, P, H, W, etc.

But L and D are more common than P and H? 

According to English letter frequency, the order is: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, D, L, U, ... 

But we have eliminated many, so among available: 
O is common, then H, D, L, U, etc.

But we are not using U in either.

So both are similar.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses U to check that vowel.

For example, ""MOURN"" is invalid because of N.

""COURT"": C absent.

""POURS"": P, O, U, R, S -> but S absent and R in position 4? Not.

""DOUGH"": D, O, U, G, H -> no R.

""GOURD"": R in position 4.

""ROUND"": R in position 1? Not.

""FJORD"": F absent and R in position 3? F-J-O-R-D -> position 3 is O? Not R.

""WORD"" is 4 letters.

I think ""WORLD"" or ""MORPH"" are fine.

Let me pick ""WORLD"" because it's a very common word.

So, next guess: WORLD

But note: we must avoid the absent letters. ""WORLD"" has no C, A, N, E, F, I, S, T. So it's safe.

Therefore, I'll go with ""WORLD"".

<guess>world</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C (absent ✗), R (present but wrong position ➖), A (absent ✗), N (absent ✗), E (absent ✗).  
- **Guess 2 (FIRST)**: F (absent ✗), I (absent ✗), R (correct position ✓), S (absent ✗), T (absent ✗).  

### Key Insights:
1. **R is in the secret word and must be in position 3** (since it was correct in position 3 of ""FIRST"").
2. **Absent letters (cannot be in the word)**: C, A, N, E, F, I, S, T.  
3. **Available letters**: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since R is already placed).  
4. The secret word pattern is: `_ _ R _ _`.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Must include R in position 3** to maintain the known correct position.  
- **Use only available letters** (avoid absent letters).  
- **Maximize information** by testing new common letters and vowels (e.g., O, U, Y) to narrow down possibilities.  
- **Valid word candidates**: After evaluating options like ""MORPH"" and ""WORLD"", ""WORLD"" was chosen because:  
  - It fits the pattern `_ _ R _ _` with R in position 3.  
  - It uses new, common letters (W, O, L, D) that are high-frequency and cover both vowels (O) and consonants.  
  - It is a valid 5-letter English word.",Guess 3: world -> FEEDBACK: W(x) O(x) R(✓) L(x) D(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We can choose a word that covers frequent letters.

 Let's consider the frequency of letters in 5-letter English words. According to various sources, the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc.

 A popular starting word is ""ROATE"" (which means the accumulated wealth) but it's not very common. Another is ""RAISE"".

 Alternatively, we can use ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E — all common letters.

 But note: we are allowed only 5-letter words. We must choose a valid word.

 I think ""CRANE"" is a good first guess because:
   - It has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N).
   - The letters C, R, A, N, E are all in the top 10 most common letters.

 However, let me check if ""CRANE"" is a valid word? Yes, it means a large bird or a type of machine.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good one: S, L, A, T, E.

 But I'll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
 Interpretation:
   - 'C' is not in the secret word.
   - 'R' is in the word but in the wrong position.
   - 'A' is not in the word.
   - 'N' is not in the word.
   - 'E' is not in the word.

 So, we know:
   - The secret word contains the letter 'R', but not in the second position (since in CRANE it was in position 2 and it's marked wrong).
   - The letters C, A, N, E are absent.

 We also know that the secret word must be a 5-letter word and include 'R'.

 We must avoid using any of the letters C, A, N, E in our next guess because they are not in the word.

 Since we only have one letter known (R) and it's not in position 2, let's think of a new word that includes 'R' but in a different position, and avoids C, A, N, E.

 We have 5 positions: 1 2 3 4 5

 Our next guess should have 'R' in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5 (because position 2 was wrong).

 Also, we want to maximize information by using new letters so that we can cover more of the alphabet.

 Let's think about what letters to use. We should avoid the eliminated letters: C, A, N, E.

 Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since 'R' is the only known letter present, we should form a word with 'R' and four other new letters.

 We can try to choose letters that are frequent. For example, common vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out). We should try to include vowels.

 Let's try to form a word that:
   - Contains 'R'
   - Does not contain C, A, N, E
   - Includes at least one vowel (like I, O, U) and other consonants.

 Potential words:
   - ""ROTLS"" is not a word.
   - ""ROUST"" - valid? (meaning: to disturb or to drive out) - let me check: it's valid.

 But note: we have to make sure the word is valid.

 However, we must also consider that 'R' is not in position 2. So in the word we choose, we can put 'R' in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 For more information, we could put 'R' in position 1? But we don't know. Alternatively, we can try a word that has 'R' in a different position than 2.

 Let me think of common words:
   - ""SPRIT"" - not valid? (it might be a rare word but let me skip)
   - ""FIRST""? But note: we have A? no, A is eliminated. ""FIRST"" has A? No, it doesn't: F-I-R-S-T. But we don't know the frequency.

 However, ""FIRST"" uses the letter I and S, T. Also, it doesn't contain A? Actually, it doesn't. But we must avoid E and we have no E.

 But wait: our eliminated letters are C, A, N, E. ""FIRST"" has none of these. And it has 'R' in the third position (position 3). That's different from position 2.

 So, ""FIRST"": 
   - Position 1: F
   - Position 2: I
   - Position 3: R
   - Position 4: S
   - Position 5: T

 This could be a good candidate because we get to check F, I, S, T and also R (in position 3).

 Alternative: ""ROUST"" - R in position 1? That might be good too but let's compare.

 We want to cover more common letters. Letters like S and T are very common.

 So, ""FIRST"" is a valid English word.

 However, note that the feedback from the first guess showed that R is not in position 2. In ""FIRST"", R is in position 3. So that's allowed.

 But we don't know if R might be in position 1 or elsewhere. However, if we put R in position 1 and it's actually there, we would get a check. But putting it in a new position might be better.

 Another candidate: ""SPORT"" - has S, P, O, R, T. But O is a vowel. And R is at position 4.

 However, I think ""FIRST"" is a solid second guess.

 Let me choose ""FIRST"".

 But wait: we haven't eliminated I, S, T. So yes.

 So, next guess: ""FIRST""

<guess>first</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C (✗), A (✗), N (✗), E (✗) are **absent** from the secret word.
- R (➖) is present but **not in position 2**.

For my next guess:
- I must exclude C, A, N, E entirely.
- I must include R, but **not in position 2**.
- I chose ""first"" because:
  - It places R in position 3 (avoiding position 2).
  - It tests new common letters: F, I, S, T.
  - As a valid 5-letter word, it balances vowel/consonant coverage (I is a vowel).

<guess>first</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: first -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(x) R(✓) S(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
  C: absent (x)
  R: present, wrong position (-)
  A: absent (x)
  N: absent (x)
  E: absent (x)

Guess 2: FIRST
  F: absent (x)
  I: absent (x)
  R: correct position (✓) - so R is in position 3 of the secret word.
  S: absent (x)
  T: absent (x)

So, what do we know?
- The secret word has the letter R in the third position (position 3).
- The letters C, A, N, E, F, I, S, T are all absent. (That is, they are not in the word at all.)

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ R _ _

And the absent letters are: C, A, N, E, F, I, S, T.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Has R in the third position.
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, A, N, E, F, I, S, T.

What letters are left? Let's list the alphabet and remove the absent ones.

Alphabet: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Absent: A, C, E, F, I, N, S, T

So, available letters: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: R is already known and must be in position 3. So for the other positions, we can use any of the available letters.

We need to form a word that has R in the middle and uses only the available letters.

We also want to maximize information, so we should try to use common letters and cover multiple possibilities.

Common letters from the available set: B, D, G, H, L, M, O, P, U, Y (for example).

We should try to include vowels because we haven't found any vowel yet. The available vowels are O, U, and sometimes Y.

So, we can try to form a word that has O or U or both.

Possible words:

- Let's try words with R in the third position.

Pattern: _ _ R _ _

We need to fill positions 1,2,4,5 with letters from B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and avoid the absent ones).

Some ideas:

- ""BROWN"": B, R, O, W, N -> but N is absent (from guess1), so invalid.
- ""CROWD"": C is absent -> invalid.
- ""GROUP"": G, R, O, U, P -> G, O, U, P are available? 
  - G: available
  - O: available
  - U: available
  - P: available
  - R: in position 3? 
  - The word ""GROUP"": 
      Position 1: G
      Position 2: R -> but we need R in position 3? In ""GROUP"", R is in position 2. We need R in position 3. So this doesn't work.

We must have R in position 3.

So, let's think of words with R in the third position.

Examples:

- ""WORDY"": W, O, R, D, Y -> 
  - W: available
  - O: available
  - R: in position 3? 
      Position 1: W
      Position 2: O
      Position 3: R -> yes, that's position 3.
      Position 4: D
      Position 5: Y
  - Check letters: W, O, R, D, Y. All are available? 
      W: yes
      O: yes
      R: known
      D: yes
      Y: yes
  - But is ""WORDY"" a valid word? Yes, meaning using too many words.

- ""MOURN"": M, O, U, R, N -> but N is absent (from guess1). Invalid.

- ""BORED"": B, O, R, E, D -> E is absent. Invalid.

- ""HORDE"": H, O, R, D, E -> E absent. Invalid.

- ""PROUD"": P, R, O, U, D -> but in ""PROUD"", R is in position 2? 
  Position 1: P
  Position 2: R -> we need R in position 3, so not.

We need R in position 3.

Another one: ""GROWL"": G, R, O, W, L -> R is in position 2? No, position 2.

What about ""QUORUM""? Too long, 6 letters.

Let me think of 5-letter words with R in the third position.

- ""ABOUT"": but A is absent and R not present.

- How about ""DOUBT"": D, O, U, B, T -> T is absent (from guess2). Invalid.

- ""JUMBO"": no R.

- ""PLUMB"": no R.

- ""BLURB"": B, L, U, R, B -> 
  Position 1: B
  Position 2: L
  Position 3: U? -> no, R is in position 4? 
  Actually: B-L-U-R-B -> so R is in position 4. We need position 3.

- ""CURRY"": C absent and R in position 3? C-U-R-R-Y -> position 3 is R? 
  Position 1: C (absent, invalid)
  Position 2: U
  Position 3: R -> yes, but C is absent so invalid.

We need to avoid absent letters.

Another idea: ""MORPH"": M, O, R, P, H -> 
  Position 1: M
  Position 2: O
  Position 3: R -> perfect.
  Position 4: P
  Position 5: H

Letters: M, O, R, P, H. 
- M: available
- O: available
- R: known
- P: available
- H: available

And ""MORPH"" is a valid word (meaning to change form).

This seems good.

Another possibility: ""YOURS"": Y, O, U, R, S -> but S is absent (from guess2). Invalid.

""DOZER"": D, O, Z, E, R -> E absent and R is in position 5? Not position 3.

""BOXER"": B, O, X, E, R -> E absent and R in position 5.

""LOVER"": L, O, V, E, R -> E absent.

""POWER"": P, O, W, E, R -> E absent.

""ROWER"": R in position 1? Not.

We need R in position 3.

""BROOD"": B, R, O, O, D -> R in position 2? Not.

""GROWL"": R in position 2.

""CRUMB"": C absent.

""DRUMB"" is not a word.

""DRUID"": D, R, U, I, D -> but I is absent (from guess2). Invalid.

""GRUMP"": G, R, U, M, P -> R in position 2? Not.

""WRONG"": W, R, O, N, G -> N absent.

""BROWN"": N absent.

""PROWL"": P, R, O, W, L -> R in position 2.

I think ""MORPH"" is a good candidate.

Another one: ""GOURD"": G, O, U, R, D -> 
  Position 1: G
  Position 2: O
  Position 3: U? -> no, R is in position 4? 
  G-O-U-R-D -> R is position 4. Not 3.

""WORLD"": W, O, R, L, D -> 
  Position 1: W
  Position 2: O
  Position 3: R -> perfect.
  Position 4: L
  Position 5: D

Letters: W, O, R, L, D. 
- W: available
- O: available
- R: known
- L: available
- D: available

And ""WORLD"" is a valid word.

So we have two candidates: ""MORPH"" and ""WORLD"".

Which one to choose? Both are valid and use available letters.

We want to cover more new letters. Let's compare:

- ""MORPH"" uses: M, O, R, P, H
- ""WORLD"" uses: W, O, R, L, D

We haven't tried M, P, H, W, L, D. Both are good.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3. We need to find the word.

Also, we don't have any vowel yet except that O and U are available. In ""MORPH"" we have O, and in ""WORLD"" we have O. So both have one vowel.

I think either is fine. Let's choose ""WORLD"" because it has more common letters? Or ""MORPH"" because it has less common letters? Actually, both are reasonable.

But let me see: we know R is in position 3, and we have no other information. So we need to test as many new letters as possible.

In ""WORLD"", we test W, O, L, D (and R is known).
In ""MORPH"", we test M, O, P, H.

The frequency of the letters in the available set: 
Common consonants: L, D, M, P, H, W, etc.

But L and D are more common than P and H? 

According to English letter frequency, the order is: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, D, L, U, ... 

But we have eliminated many, so among available: 
O is common, then H, D, L, U, etc.

But we are not using U in either.

So both are similar.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses U to check that vowel.

For example, ""MOURN"" is invalid because of N.

""COURT"": C absent.

""POURS"": P, O, U, R, S -> but S absent and R in position 4? Not.

""DOUGH"": D, O, U, G, H -> no R.

""GOURD"": R in position 4.

""ROUND"": R in position 1? Not.

""FJORD"": F absent and R in position 3? F-J-O-R-D -> position 3 is O? Not R.

""WORD"" is 4 letters.

I think ""WORLD"" or ""MORPH"" are fine.

Let me pick ""WORLD"" because it's a very common word.

So, next guess: WORLD

But note: we must avoid the absent letters. ""WORLD"" has no C, A, N, E, F, I, S, T. So it's safe.

Therefore, I'll go with ""WORLD"".

(it might be a rare word but let me skip)\n   - ""FIRST""? But note: we have A? no, A is eliminated. ""FIRST"" has A? No, it doesn\'t: F-I-R-S-T. But we don\'t know the frequency.\n\n However, ""FIRST"" uses the letter I and S, T. Also, it doesn\'t contain A? Actually, it doesn\'t. But we must avoid E and we have no E.\n\n But wait: our eliminated letters are C, A, N, E. ""FIRST"" has none of these. And it has \'R\' in the third position (position 3). That\'s different from position 2.\n\n So, ""FIRST"": \n   - Position 1: F\n   - Position 2: I\n   - Position 3: R\n   - Position 4: S\n   - Position 5: T\n\n This could be a good candidate because we get to check F, I, S, T and also R (in position 3).\n\n Alternative: ""ROUST"" - R in position 1? That might be good too but let\'s compare.\n\n We want to cover more common letters. Letters like S and T are very common.\n\n So, ""FIRST"" is a valid English word.\n\n However, note that the feedback from the first guess showed that R is not in position 2. In ""FIRST"", R is in position 3. So that\'s allowed.\n\n But we don\'t know if R might be in position 1 or elsewhere. However, if we put R in position 1 and it\'s actually there, we would get a check. But putting it in a new position might be better.\n\n Another candidate: ""SPORT"" - has S, P, O, R, T. But O is a vowel. And R is at position 4.\n\n However, I think ""FIRST"" is a solid second guess.\n\n Let me choose ""FIRST"".\n\n But wait: we haven\'t eliminated I, S, T. So yes.\n\n So, next guess: ""FIRST""\n\n<guess>first</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C (✗), A (✗), N (✗), E (✗) are **absent** from the secret word.\n- R (➖) is present but **not in position 2**.\n\nFor my next guess:\n- I must exclude C, A, N, E entirely.\n- I must include R, but **not in position 2**.\n- I chose ""first"" because:\n  - It places R in position 3 (avoiding position 2).\n  - It tests new common letters: F, I, S, T.\n  - As a valid 5-letter word, it balances vowel/consonant coverage (I is a vowel).\n\n<guess>first</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: first -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(x) R(✓) S(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n  C: absent (x)\n  R: present, wrong position (-)\n  A: absent (x)\n  N: absent (x)\n  E: absent (x)\n\nGuess 2: FIRST\n  F: absent (x)\n  I: absent (x)\n  R: correct position (✓) - so R is in position 3 of the secret word.\n  S: absent (x)\n  T: absent (x)\n\nSo, what do we know?\n- The secret word has the letter R in the third position (position 3).\n- The letters C, A, N, E, F, I, S, T are all absent.

So for the other positions, we can use any of the available letters.\n\nWe need to form a word that has R in the middle and uses only the available letters.\n\nWe also want to maximize information, so we should try to use common letters and cover multiple possibilities.\n\nCommon letters from the available set: B, D, G, H, L, M, O, P, U, Y (for example).\n\nWe should try to include vowels because we haven\'t found any vowel yet.

No, position 2.\n\nWhat about ""QUORUM""? Too long, 6 letters.\n\nLet me think of 5-letter words with R in the third position.\n\n- ""ABOUT"": but A is absent and R not present.\n\n- How about ""DOUBT"": D, O, U, B, T -> T is absent (from guess2). Invalid.\n\n- ""JUMBO"": no R.\n\n- ""PLUMB"": no R.\n\n- ""BLURB"": B, L, U, R, B -> \n  Position 1: B\n  Position 2: L\n  Position 3: U? -> no, R is in position 4? \n  Actually: B-L-U-R-B -> so R is in position 4. We need position 3.\n\n- ""CURRY"": C absent and R in position 3? C-U-R-R-Y -> position 3 is R? \n  Position 1: C (absent, invalid)\n  Position 2: U\n  Position 3: R -> yes, but C is absent so invalid.\n\nWe need to avoid absent letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""MORPH"": M, O, R, P, H -> \n  Position 1: M\n  Position 2: O\n  Position 3: R -> perfect.\n  Position 4: P\n  Position 5: H\n\nLetters: M, O, R, P, H. \n- M: available\n- O: available\n- R: known\n- P: available\n- H: available\n\nAnd ""MORPH"" is a valid word (meaning to change form).\n\nThis seems good.\n\nAnother possibility: ""YOURS"": Y, O, U, R, S -> but S is absent (from guess2).

Not position 3.\n\n""BOXER"": B, O, X, E, R -> E absent and R in position 5.\n\n""LOVER"": L, O, V, E, R -> E absent.\n\n""POWER"": P, O, W, E, R -> E absent.\n\n""ROWER"": R in position 1?

Not.\n\n""WRONG"": W, R, O, N, G -> N absent.\n\n""BROWN"": N absent.\n\n""PROWL"": P, R, O, W, L -> R in position 2.\n\nI think ""MORPH"" is a good candidate.\n\nAnother one: ""GOURD"": G, O, U, R, D -> \n  Position 1: G\n  Position 2: O\n  Position 3: U? -> no, R is in position 4? \n  G-O-U-R-D -> R is position 4. Not 3.\n\n""WORLD"": W, O, R, L, D -> \n  Position 1: W\n  Position 2: O\n  Position 3: R -> perfect.\n  Position 4: L\n  Position 5: D\n\nLetters: W, O, R, L, D. \n- W: available\n- O: available\n- R: known\n- L: available\n- D: available\n\nAnd ""WORLD"" is a valid word.\n\nSo we have two candidates: ""MORPH"" and ""WORLD"".\n\nWhich one to choose? Both are valid and use available letters.\n\nWe want to cover more new letters. Let\'s compare:\n\n- ""MORPH"" uses: M, O, R, P, H\n- ""WORLD"" uses: W, O, R, L, D\n\nWe haven\'t tried M, P, H, W, L, D. Both are good.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3. We need to find the word.\n\nAlso, we don\'t have any vowel yet except that O and U are available. In ""MORPH"" we have O, and in ""WORLD"" we have O. So both have one vowel.\n\nI think either is fine. Let\'s choose ""WORLD"" because it has more common letters? Or ""MORPH"" because it has less common letters? Actually, both are reasonable.\n\nBut let me see: we know R is in position 3, and we have no other information. So we need to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nIn ""WORLD"", we test W, O, L, D (and R is known).\nIn ""MORPH"", we test M, O, P, H.\n\nThe frequency of the letters in the available set: \nCommon consonants: L, D, M, P, H, W, etc.\n\nBut L and D are more common than P and H? \n\nAccording to English letter frequency, the order is: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, D, L, U, ... \n\nBut we have eliminated many, so among available: \nO is common, then H, D, L, U, etc.\n\nBut we are not using U in either.\n\nSo both are similar.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that uses U to check that vowel.\n\nFor example, ""MOURN"" is invalid because of N.\n\n""COURT"": C absent.\n\n""POURS"": P, O, U, R, S -> but S absent and R in position 4? Not.\n\n""DOUGH"": D, O, U, G, H -> no R.\n\n""GOURD"": R in position 4.\n\n""ROUND"": R in position 1? Not.\n\n""FJORD"": F absent and R in position 3? F-J-O-R-D -> position 3 is O? Not R.\n\n""WORD"" is 4 letters.\n\nI think ""WORLD"" or ""MORPH"" are fine.\n\nLet me pick ""WORLD"" because it\'s a very common word.\n\nSo, next guess: WORLD\n\nBut note: we must avoid the absent letters. ""WORLD"" has no C, A, N, E, F, I, S, T. So it\'s safe.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""WORLD"".\n\n<guess>world</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C (absent ✗), R (present but wrong position ➖), A (absent ✗), N (absent ✗), E (absent ✗).  \n- **Guess 2 (FIRST)**: F (absent ✗), I (absent ✗), R (correct position ✓), S (absent ✗), T (absent ✗).  \n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **R is in the secret word and must be in position 3** (since it was correct in position 3 of ""FIRST"").\n2. **Absent letters (cannot be in the word)**: C, A, N, E, F, I, S, T.  \n3. **Available letters**: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since R is already placed).  \n4.

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
  C: absent (x)
  R: present but wrong position (-) -> but note, in guess 2 we found R is in position 3, so this was a hint that R is not in position 2.
  A: absent (x)
  N: absent (x)
  E: absent (x)

Guess 2: FIRST
  F: absent (x)
  I: absent (x)
  R: correct (✓) in position 3 -> so R is fixed at position 3.
  S: absent (x)
  T: absent (x)

Guess 3: WORLD
  W: absent (x)
  O: absent (x)
  R: correct (✓) in position 3 -> confirmed
  L: absent (x)
  D: absent (x)

So, we know:
- The secret word has R in the third position: _ _ R _ _
- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, F, I, S, T, W, O, L, D
  (from all the x's: C, A, N, E from guess1; F, I, S, T from guess2; W, O, L, D from guess3)

Now, what letters are left? We have to consider the English alphabet and remove the absent ones.

Alphabet: A to Z.

Absent: A, C, D, E, F, I, L, N, O, S, T, W

So available letters: B, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

And we know R is in the word and fixed at position 3.

We need to form a 5-letter word that has R in the third position and uses only the available letters.

The word must be from the available set: B, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We also need to include a vowel because we haven't found any vowel yet. The available vowels are U and sometimes Y (if considered vowel). The other vowels (A, E, I, O) are all absent.

So the word must contain at least one of U or Y.

Let's try to find words that fit:

Pattern: _ _ R _ _

With available letters: B, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We can try words like:

- ""BURGH"" - a word? It means a town or borough. Valid? Yes, in some contexts. But let's check: B, U, R, G, H -> positions: B at 1, U at 2, R at 3, G at 4, H at 5. And all letters are available.

- ""MURKY"": M, U, R, K, Y -> M, U, R, K, Y. All available? M: yes, U: yes, R: fixed at 3, K: yes, Y: yes. And ""MURKY"" is a valid word.

- ""PURGE"": P, U, R, G, E -> but E is absent (from guess1). Invalid.

- ""JUROR"": J, U, R, O, R -> O is absent (from guess3). Invalid.

- ""HURRY"": H, U, R, R, Y -> H: available, U: available, R: at position 3 and 4? But we have R at position 3, and then another R? The word is H-U-R-R-Y. So position 3 is R, position 4 is R. But we don't know if the word has two R's. However, H and Y are available. But we have to check if Y is available? Yes. But note: in ""HURRY"", the first R is at position 3, which is fixed. The second R is at position 4. But we don't know if that's allowed. It is, but we have to see.

However, we have to avoid absent letters. ""HURRY"" has H, U, R, R, Y. All are available? H: yes, U: yes, R: yes, Y: yes. And O is not present? O is absent, but ""HURRY"" doesn't have O. So it's valid.

But we have two R's? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters unless we guess them. But we can have duplicate letters.

Another word: ""BURKA"" or ""BURQA"" - but A is absent.

""QUERY"": Q, U, E, R, Y -> E is absent. Invalid.

""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> S absent and no R? We need R at position 3.

""GRUMP"": G, R, U, M, P -> but in ""GRUMP"", R is at position 2? Not position 3.

We need R at position 3.

""BURPS"": B, U, R, P, S -> S absent.

""BURNT"": N and T absent.

So, let's list possible words from the available letters with R at position 3:

- ""MURKY"": M, U, R, K, Y -> positions: M(1), U(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5)
- ""BURGH"": B(1), U(2), R(3), G(4), H(5)
- ""HURRY"": H(1), U(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5) -> note double R, but that's allowed.
- ""PURPY"" not a word.
- ""GURGY"" not a word.
- ""KURUS"": K, U, R, U, S -> S absent and double U? Also S is absent.
- ""MURKS"": S absent.
- ""BURKS"": S absent.

Another one: ""JURGY"" not a word.

""VUGHY"" not a word.

""YUMMY"": no R.

""BUMPY"": M, P, Y, but no R and position? B-U-M-P-Y -> no R.

We need R at position 3.

""BURQA"": A absent.

""QURSH"": Q, U, R, S, H -> S absent.

""QURSH"" might be a word (currency) but S is absent.

So, the best candidates are ""MURKY"", ""BURGH"", and ""HURRY"".

We need to choose one. Let's think about which one gives more information.

We have to test as many new letters as possible.

Available letters left: B, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We have used in the candidates:

- ""MURKY"": uses M, U, K, Y (and R)
- ""BURGH"": uses B, U, G, H (and R)
- ""HURRY"": uses H, U, Y (and R, and another R)

""HURRY"" has a double R, which might be less common, but it's possible.

We can also consider ""PURPY"" not valid.

Another word: ""MURVA"" not valid and A absent.

""JURAT"": J, U, R, A, T -> A and T absent.

Not.

""KURTA"": A absent.

I think ""MURKY"" and ""BURGH"" are better because they use more distinct letters.

Between ""MURKY"" and ""BURGH"", which one?

- ""MURKY"" uses M, U, K, Y
- ""BURGH"" uses B, U, G, H

We haven't tried any of these letters, so both are good.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 out of 6). We need to maximize the chance of hitting.

Also, we need to consider that the word must have a vowel, and U is the only vowel left (Y can be a vowel but sometimes consonant).

So, let's pick ""MURKY"" because it includes Y, which can be a vowel, and we test K and Y.

Alternatively, ""BURGH"" tests G and H.

I think both are equally good. I'll go with ""MURKY"" because it's a more common word.

So, next guess: MURKY

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C (✗), R (➖), A (✗), N (✗), E (✗)  
  → R is present but not in position 2. All other letters (C, A, N, E) are absent.  
- **Guess 2 (FIRST)**: F (✗), I (✗), R (✓), S (✗), T (✗)  
  → R is **correct in position 3**. All other letters (F, I, S, T) are absent.  
- **Guess 3 (WORLD)**: W (✗), O (✗), R (✓), L (✗), D (✗)  
  → R is **confirmed in position 3**. All other letters (W, O, L, D) are absent.  

### Key Insights:
1. **R is fixed in position 3**: The secret word pattern is `_ _ R _ _`.  
2. **Absent letters (13 total)**: C, A, N, E, F, I, S, T, W, O, L, D (all marked ✗).  
3. **Available letters (13 remaining)**: B, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.  
4. **Vowel requirement**: Since A, E, I, O are absent, the word must include **U** or **Y** (the only vowels left).  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Must place R in position 3** and use **only available letters**.  
- Prioritize words with **U or Y** to cover vowels.  
- Test **new high-frequency consonants** (e.g., B, G, H, K, M, P) to maximize information.  
- Avoid repeating absent letters.  

### Selected Guess: **MURKY**
- **Why MURKY?**  
  - Fits the pattern: `M U R K Y` → R is in position 3.  
  - Uses available letters: M, U, K, Y (all new and untested).  
  - Includes **U and Y** (critical vowels).  
  - Tests common consonants (M, K) and less common Y.  
  - Valid English word (meaning dark or obscure).  

If correct, this could solve the puzzle. If not, feedback will reveal which of M, U, K, Y are present/absent, drastically narrowing options.  

<guess>murky</guess>",murky,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
  C: absent (x)
  R: present but wrong position (-) -> but note, in guess 2 we found R is in position 3, so this was a hint that R is not in position 2.
  A: absent (x)
  N: absent (x)
  E: absent (x)

Guess 2: FIRST
  F: absent (x)
  I: absent (x)
  R: correct (✓) in position 3 -> so R is fixed at position 3.
  S: absent (x)
  T: absent (x)

Guess 3: WORLD
  W: absent (x)
  O: absent (x)
  R: correct (✓) in position 3 -> confirmed
  L: absent (x)
  D: absent (x)

So, we know:
- The secret word has R in the third position: _ _ R _ _
- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, F, I, S, T, W, O, L, D
  (from all the x's: C, A, N, E from guess1; F, I, S, T from guess2; W, O, L, D from guess3)

Now, what letters are left? We have to consider the English alphabet and remove the absent ones.

Alphabet: A to Z.

Absent: A, C, D, E, F, I, L, N, O, S, T, W

So available letters: B, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

And we know R is in the word and fixed at position 3.

We need to form a 5-letter word that has R in the third position and uses only the available letters.

The word must be from the available set: B, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We also need to include a vowel because we haven't found any vowel yet. The available vowels are U and sometimes Y (if considered vowel). The other vowels (A, E, I, O) are all absent.

So the word must contain at least one of U or Y.

We can try words like:

- ""MURKY"": M, U, R, K, Y -> M, U, R, K, Y. All available? M: yes, U: yes, R: fixed at 3, K: yes, Y: yes. And ""MURKY"" is a valid word.

- ""PURGE"": P, U, R, G, E -> but E is absent (from guess1). Invalid.

- ""JUROR"": J, U, R, O, R -> O is absent (from guess3). Invalid.

- ""HURRY"": H, U, R, R, Y -> H: available, U: available, R: at position 3 and 4? But we have R at position 3, and then another R? The word is H-U-R-R-Y. So position 3 is R, position 4 is R. But we don't know if the word has two R's. However, H and Y are available. But we have to check if Y is available? Yes. But note: in ""HURRY"", the first R is at position 3, which is fixed. The second R is at position 4. But we don't know if that's allowed. It is, but we have to see.

However, we have to avoid absent letters. ""HURRY"" has H, U, R, R, Y. All are available? H: yes, U: yes, R: yes, Y: yes. And O is not present? O is absent, but ""HURRY"" doesn't have O. So it's valid.

But we have two R's? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters unless we guess them. But we can have duplicate letters.

Another word: ""BURKA"" or ""BURQA"" - but A is absent.

""QUERY"": Q, U, E, R, Y -> E is absent. Invalid.

""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> S absent and no R? We need R at position 3.

""GRUMP"": G, R, U, M, P -> but in ""GRUMP"", R is at position 2? Not position 3.

We need R at position 3.

""BURPS"": B, U, R, P, S -> S absent.

""BURNT"": N and T absent.

So, let's list possible words from the available letters with R at position 3:

- ""MURKY"": M, U, R, K, Y -> positions: M(1), U(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5)
- ""BURGH"": B(1), U(2), R(3), G(4), H(5)
- ""HURRY"": H(1), U(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5) -> note double R, but that's allowed.
- ""PURPY"" not a word.
- ""GURGY"" not a word.
- ""KURUS"": K, U, R, U, S -> S absent and double U? Also S is absent.
- ""MURKS"": S absent.
- ""BURKS"": S absent.

Another one: ""JURGY"" not a word.

""VUGHY"" not a word.

""YUMMY"": no R.

""BUMPY"": M, P, Y, but no R and position? B-U-M-P-Y -> no R.

We need R at position 3.

""BURQA"": A absent.

""QURSH"": Q, U, R, S, H -> S absent.

""QURSH"" might be a word (currency) but S is absent.

So, the best candidates are ""MURKY"", ""BURGH"", and ""HURRY"".

We need to choose one. Let's think about which one gives more information.

We have to test as many new letters as possible.

Available letters left: B, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We have used in the candidates:

- ""MURKY"": uses M, U, K, Y (and R)
- ""BURGH"": uses B, U, G, H (and R)
- ""HURRY"": uses H, U, Y (and R, and another R)

""HURRY"" has a double R, which might be less common, but it's possible.

We can also consider ""PURPY"" not valid.

Another word: ""MURVA"" not valid and A absent.

""JURAT"": J, U, R, A, T -> A and T absent.

Not.

""KURTA"": A absent.

I think ""MURKY"" and ""BURGH"" are better because they use more distinct letters.

Between ""MURKY"" and ""BURGH"", which one?

- ""MURKY"" uses M, U, K, Y
- ""BURGH"" uses B, U, G, H

We haven't tried any of these letters, so both are good.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 out of 6). We need to maximize the chance of hitting.

Also, we need to consider that the word must have a vowel, and U is the only vowel left (Y can be a vowel but sometimes consonant).

So, let's pick ""MURKY"" because it includes Y, which can be a vowel, and we test K and Y.

Alternatively, ""BURGH"" tests G and H.

I think both are equally good. I'll go with ""MURKY"" because it's a more common word.

So, next guess: MURKY

<guess>murky</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C (✗), R (➖), A (✗), N (✗), E (✗)  
  → R is present but not in position 2. All other letters (C, A, N, E) are absent.  
- **Guess 2 (FIRST)**: F (✗), I (✗), R (✓), S (✗), T (✗)  
  → R is **correct in position 3**. All other letters (F, I, S, T) are absent.  
- **Guess 3 (WORLD)**: W (✗), O (✗), R (✓), L (✗), D (✗)  
  → R is **confirmed in position 3**. All other letters (W, O, L, D) are absent.  

### Key Insights:
1. **R is fixed in position 3**: The secret word pattern is `_ _ R _ _`.  
2. **Absent letters (13 total)**: C, A, N, E, F, I, S, T, W, O, L, D (all marked ✗).  
3. **Available letters (13 remaining)**: B, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.  
4. **Vowel requirement**: Since A, E, I, O are absent, the word must include **U** or **Y** (the only vowels left).  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Must place R in position 3** and use **only available letters**.  
- Prioritize words with **U or Y** to cover vowels.  
- Test **new high-frequency consonants** (e.g., B, G, H, K, M, P) to maximize information.  
- Avoid repeating absent letters.  

### Selected Guess: **MURKY**
- **Why MURKY?**  
  - Fits the pattern: `M U R K Y` → R is in position 3.  
  - Uses available letters: M, U, K, Y (all new and untested).  
  - Includes **U and Y** (critical vowels).  
  - Tests common consonants (M, K) and less common Y.  
  - Valid English word (meaning dark or obscure).  

If correct, this could solve the puzzle. If not, feedback will reveal which of M, U, K, Y are present/absent, drastically narrowing options.",Guess 4: murky -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) U(✓) R(✓) K(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
