We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: - (meaning C is in the word but in the wrong position)
 R: x (R is not in the word)
 A: - (A is in the word but in the wrong position)
 N: - (N is in the word but in the wrong position)
 E: x (E is not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters C, A, and N, but not R or E.
 - The positions of C, A, and N in ""crane"" are incorrect.

 Since the word is 5 letters, and we have three confirmed letters: C, A, N.

 We also know that R and E are absent.

 Now, for the next guess, we want to try a word that:
 1. Includes C, A, N (because they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
 2. Avoids R and E.

 Additionally, we can try to include other common letters to test for their presence.

 In the first guess, the positions were:
   c (position 1) -> must not be in position 1 in the secret word? Actually, the feedback says it's present but in the wrong position, so indeed C cannot be at position 1.
   Similarly, A was at position 3 and N at position 4, so they cannot be in those positions.

 So, for the next guess:
 - C must not be in position 1.
 - A must not be in position 3.
 - N must not be in position 4.

 We also know that the secret word does not have R or E.

 Let's think of words that have C, A, N and two new letters (to test) and that place C, A, N in positions different from the first guess.

 We can try to put C in a different position, say position 2, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we have to avoid the positions that are already known to be wrong for each.

 However, we don't know the correct positions yet. We just know they are not in the positions we tried.

 Let me try to think of a word that has C, A, N and two new letters.

 Example: ""CLANG"" -> but note that in ""crane"", C was at position 1 and now in ""clang"" it is again at position 1 -> that would be invalid because we know C is not at position 1.

 So we must avoid putting C at position 1.

 How about ""PANIC""? 
 Let's check:
   P (new), A (at position 2, which is different from position 3 in the first guess), N (at position 3, but in the first guess it was at position 4 -> different), I (new), C (at position 5, which is not position 1).

 Also, ""PANIC"" does not contain R or E.

 But note: in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and now in ""PANIC"" it is at position 2 -> that's a different position, so that's allowed.

 Similarly, N was at position 4 in ""crane"" and now at position 3 -> different.

 So ""PANIC"" seems like a good candidate.

 However, we must make sure that we are not repeating the same mistake. Also, we are testing two new letters: P and I.

 Alternatively, we could try ""CANAL"", but note:
   In ""CANAL"": 
      C is at position 1 -> but we know C cannot be at position 1 (from the feedback of the first guess). So that's invalid.

 Another option: ""NACHO"" -> 
   N at position 1 (in first guess N was at position 4 -> different), 
   A at position 2 (different from position 3), 
   C at position 3 (different from position 1), 
   H and O are new. 
   But note: the word ""NACHO"" is 5 letters? Yes.

 However, we must check if it's a valid word. I believe it is.

 But let me think: we are avoiding R and E, and ""NACHO"" doesn't have them.

 Alternatively, we could try ""DANCE"":
   D (new), A at position 2 (was at 3 -> different), N at position 3 (was at 4 -> different), C at position 4 (was at 1 -> different), E -> but E is not allowed! Because we know E is absent.

 So we cannot use E.

 Another word: ""MANIC"" -> 
   M (new), A at position 2 (was at 3 -> different), N at position 3 (was at 4 -> different), I (new), C at position 5 (was at 1 -> different). 
   This also avoids R and E.

 But note: we have two words: ""PANIC"" and ""MANIC"" and ""NACHO"". 

 We want to maximize the information. We are testing two new letters in each.

 However, we have three known letters (C, A, N) and we are including them all. We are also testing two new letters.

 I think ""PANIC"" is a good choice because P and I are common letters.

 But let me also consider ""PAINT"": 
   P, A, I, N, T -> but note: in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and in ""PAINT"" A is at position 2 -> that's different. 
   N is at position 4 in ""PAINT"", but in ""crane"" it was at position 4 -> same position? 
   Wait, the feedback for the first guess said N is in the word but in the wrong position. So if we put N at position 4 again, that would be the same position that we know is wrong? 
   Therefore, we must avoid putting N at position 4.

 So ""PAINT"" would have N at position 4 -> invalid because we know from the first guess that N is not at position 4.

 Similarly, in ""PANIC"", the positions are:
   P (1), A (2), N (3), I (4), C (5)

 So for A: in the first guess it was at position 3, now at 2 -> different -> good.
 For N: in the first guess at 4, now at 3 -> different -> good.
 For C: in the first guess at 1, now at 5 -> different -> good.

 Therefore, ""PANIC"" is acceptable.

 Alternatively, ""NICAD"" (a type of battery) but it might be too obscure.

 I think ""PANIC"" is a common word and a good choice.

 Let's go with ""PANIC"".

    - A at position 2 (was position 3 in ""crane"")
    - N at position 3 (was position 4 in ""crane"")
    - C at position 5 (was position 1 in ""crane"")
  - It tests two new common letters: **P** (position 1) and **I** (position 4).
  - It avoids **R** and **E** entirely.

This guess maximizes information by repositioning known letters and probing new ones.

Also, we are testing two new letters: P and I.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""CANAL"", but note:\n   In ""CANAL"": \n      C is at position 1 -> but we know C cannot be at position 1 (from the feedback of the first guess).

Yes.\n\n However, we must check if it\'s a valid word. I believe it is.\n\n But let me think: we are avoiding R and E, and ""NACHO"" doesn\'t have them.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""DANCE"":\n   D (new), A at position 2 (was at 3 -> different), N at position 3 (was at 4 -> different), C at position 4 (was at 1 -> different), E -> but E is not allowed! Because we know E is absent.\n\n So we cannot use E.\n\n Another word: ""MANIC"" -> \n   M (new), A at position 2 (was at 3 -> different), N at position 3 (was at 4 -> different), I (new), C at position 5 (was at 1 -> different). \n   This also avoids R and E.\n\n But note: we have two words: ""PANIC"" and ""MANIC"" and ""NACHO"". \n\n We want to maximize the information. We are testing two new letters in each.\n\n However, we have three known letters (C, A, N) and we are including them all. We are also testing two new letters.\n\n I think ""PANIC"" is a good choice because P and I are common letters.\n\n But let me also consider ""PAINT"": \n   P, A, I, N, T -> but note: in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and in ""PAINT"" A is at position 2 -> that\'s different. \n   N is at position 4 in ""PAINT"", but in ""crane"" it was at position 4 -> same position? \n   Wait, the feedback for the first guess said N is in the word but in the wrong position. So if we put N at position 4 again, that would be the same position that we know is wrong? \n   Therefore, we must avoid putting N at position 4.\n\n So ""PAINT"" would have N at position 4 -> invalid because we know from the first guess that N is not at position 4.\n\n Similarly, in ""PANIC"", the positions are:\n   P (1), A (2), N (3), I (4), C (5)\n\n So for A: in the first guess it was at position 3, now at 2 -> different -> good.\n For N: in the first guess at 4, now at 3 -> different -> good.\n For C: in the first guess at 1, now at 5 -> different -> good.\n\n Therefore, ""PANIC"" is acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, ""NICAD"" (a type of battery) but it might be too obscure.\n\n I think ""PANIC"" is a common word and a good choice.\n\n Let\'s go with ""PANIC"".\n\n<guess>panic</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C** is in the word but not in position 1 (marked `-`)\n- **R** is absent (marked `x`)\n- **A** is in the word but not in position 3 (marked `-`)\n- **N** is in the word but not in position 4 (marked `-`)\n- **E** is absent (marked `x`)\n\nKey deductions:\n1.

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Meaning:
- C is present but not in position 1.
- R is absent.
- A is present but not in position 3.
- N is present but not in position 4.
- E is absent.

Guess 2: ""panic"" -> Feedback: P(x) A(✓) N(-) I(x) C(-)
Meaning:
- P is absent.
- A is correct and in the right position (position 2).
- N is present but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 in ""panic"").
- I is absent.
- C is present but not in position 5.

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word has the letter A in position 2 (from guess 2: A(✓)).
2. The secret word contains the letters: C, A, N (from guess 1 and confirmed in guess 2) and also we know C is still present (from guess 2: C(-)).
3. The secret word does not contain: R, E, P, I (from the x's in both guesses).
4. Position constraints:
   - C cannot be in position 1 (from guess 1) and cannot be in position 5 (from guess 2).
   - N cannot be in position 4 (from guess 1) and cannot be in position 3 (from guess 2).
   - A is fixed at position 2.

We also know that the word has 5 letters, and we have three confirmed letters: A (at position 2), C, and N. But note that there might be more letters we haven't discovered.

Since A is at position 2, and we have C and N to place, and we know two more letters that are absent (P and I), we need to think of words that fit.

Let's list the positions:

Position 1: Cannot be C (from guess1), and we know P is absent so it can't be P. Also, R and E are absent. So position 1 must be a new letter or one of the known present letters (but C is forbidden at pos1). However, we know N is present but we don't know if it can be at position 1? We don't have any constraint that N cannot be at position 1. Similarly, we don't know about other letters.

But note: we have two more positions to fill: positions 3, 4, and 5? Actually, position 2 is fixed as A. So we have positions 1, 3, 4, 5 to fill with the remaining letters.

We know the word must have C and N, and two more letters (since we have 5 letters and we already have A, and then C and N, so two more). But we don't know if there are duplicate letters? The rules don't say the word has distinct letters, but in Wordle, duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, if a letter is repeated, it might be marked accordingly. But so far, we haven't seen any duplicate.

Given the feedback, we can assume for now that there are no duplicates because we haven't encountered any.

So, we have:
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- The word must contain C and N (each exactly once, for now) and two other letters that are not R, E, P, I.

Also, constraints on positions for C and N:
- C cannot be in position 1 or 5 -> so C must be in position 3 or 4.
- N cannot be in position 3 or 4 -> so N must be in position 1 or 5.

But note: position 1 and 5 are the only options for N? And positions 3 and 4 for C.

But wait: if N is at position 1, then C must be at 3 or 4. If N is at position 5, then C must be at 3 or 4.

Now, we also have two more letters to find. They must be letters that are not in the set {R, E, P, I} and not A, C, N (if no duplicates). But A is already placed, so we are looking for two new letters.

Let's think of possible words.

Case 1: N at position 1, and C at position 3 or 4.
- If N at 1, then the word starts with N, then A at 2.
- Then position 3: could be C? But if C is at 3, then we have ""N A C ..."". Then positions 4 and 5 are two new letters.
- Or C at 4: then position 3 is a new letter, then C at 4, then a new letter at 5.

Case 2: N at position 5, and C at position 3 or 4.
- If C at 3: then we have _ A C _ N
- If C at 4: then we have _ A _ C N

Now, we need to fill the blanks with two new letters that are not R, E, P, I.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Let me try to list possible words:

First, for case 1: N at position 1, and C at position 3: ""N A C _ _""
Possible words: 
- ""NACHO"" -> but we know I is absent (from guess2: I(x)), so ""NACHO"" has O? But also, we have H and O. However, we don't know about H and O. But ""NACHO"" has I? No, ""NACHO"" is N-A-C-H-O. So no I. But we have to check if it fits the constraints. 
  - However, in ""NACHO"", C is at position 3? Yes. But in the first guess, C was at position 1 and we know it's not at 1, but now at 3 is allowed. 
  - But in the second guess, we had C at position 5 and we got C(-) meaning C is not at 5. In ""NACHO"", C is at 3, which is not 5, so that's fine. 
  - However, we have a problem: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and we got N(-) meaning N is not at 4. In ""NACHO"", N is at position 1, which is allowed. 
  - But we also have A at position 2, which is fixed. 
  - Now, the issue: we have H and O. Are they allowed? We haven't tested H or O. 
  - But wait, in the second guess, we tested P, A, N, I, C. We know P and I are absent. So H and O are new. 
  - However, we must check if ""NACHO"" is a valid word? Yes.

But we have another constraint: in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and we got A(-) meaning A is in the word but not at 3. In ""NACHO"", A is at position 2, which is correct and we already know that. So that's fine.

But we have a problem: in the second guess, we had N at position 3 and we got N(-) meaning N is not at 3. In ""NACHO"", N is at 1, so that's fine.

However, we are considering C at position 3. In ""NACHO"", C is at position 3. But we have no constraint that C cannot be at 3? Actually, we don't. The constraints for C are: not at 1 and not at 5. So position 3 is allowed.

But wait: in the second guess, we had C at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position (C(-)), so we know C is not at 5. But we don't have any feedback that says C cannot be at 3.

So ""NACHO"" is a candidate? But we must check the feedback we would have gotten for the first guess if the word was ""NACHO"". However, we don't need to because we are building from the feedback.

But note: in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and the feedback for A was A(-) meaning A is present but not at position 3. In ""NACHO"", A is at 2, so that's consistent. Similarly, C is at 3 in ""NACHO"", but in ""crane"" C was at 1 and we got C(-) meaning it's present but not at 1. So that's consistent.

But in the second guess, we had ""panic"" and the feedback for A was A(✓) which matches because A is at 2. For N: in ""panic"" we had N at 3 and we got N(-) meaning N is present but not at 3. In ""NACHO"", N is at 1, so that's consistent. For C: in ""panic"" we had C at 5 and we got C(-) meaning C is present but not at 5. In ""NACHO"", C is at 3, so that's consistent.

And the absent letters: R, E, P, I are not in ""NACHO"". So it fits.

But we have two more cases. Also, we have the case with C at position 4.

But let's see if there are other words.

Another word for case 1: N at 1, C at 4: ""N A _ C _""
What words? ""NAVY"" is 4 letters. ""NARC?"" but R is absent. ""NABC?"" not a word. ""NAHAL""? not common. ""NASTY"" has S and T, but let's see: ""NASTY"" is N-A-S-T-Y. 
- S and T are new. 
- But in ""NASTY"", C is not present? But we know C must be in the word. So that doesn't work.

Similarly, ""NADIR"" has R -> absent. ""NAIAD"" has I -> absent. So no common words for ""N A _ C _"".

Now, case 2: N at position 5, and C at position 3: then we have _ A C _ N
Possible words: 
- ""TACAN"" (a navigation system) -> but T is new, and then the fourth letter? ""TACAN"" is T-A-C-A-N -> but that has two A's? 
  - Let's check: positions: T(1), A(2), C(3), A(4), N(5). 
  - But we have two A's. The feedback from the first guess: we had A at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. In ""TACAN"", there is an A at position 2 (fixed) and at position 4. 
  - The feedback for the first guess would have marked the A as present (because there is at least one A) but since the first guess had A at position 3 and in the secret word there is an A at 2 and 4, then the feedback for the first guess would have marked the A as present but not at 3? Actually, it would. But also, the duplicate: the feedback doesn't specify which A. 
  - However, in the second guess, we had A at position 2 and it was correct, so that A is fixed. Now, if there is another A at position 4, that would be acceptable. 
  - But we don't have any feedback that says there is a duplicate. 
  - However, in the second guess, we only tested one A (at position 2) and it was correct. We didn't test position 4. 
  - But the problem is: in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. In ""TACAN"", the A at position 3 is not present (because the A's are at 2 and 4). So the feedback for the first guess would have marked the A as absent? But that's not what happened. We got A(-) meaning present but wrong position. 
  - Therefore, if the secret word is ""TACAN"", then in the first guess ""crane"", the A at position 3: the secret word has A at 2 and 4, so the A in ""crane"" at 3 is not matching, but there is an A in the word (at 2 and 4) so it should be marked as present but wrong position. So that's consistent. 
  - Now, in the second guess ""panic"": 
      P (absent) -> correct, 
      A at 2 (correct) -> marked as correct, 
      N at 3: in ""TACAN"", position 3 is C, so N is not at 3 -> but we have N in the word at position 5, so it should be marked as present but wrong position? But in the feedback we got N(-) for ""panic"", which means present but wrong position. 
      I (absent) -> correct, 
      C at 5: in ""TACAN"", C is at 3, so not at 5 -> so it should be marked as present but wrong position? And we got C(-) for that. 
  - So ""TACAN"" seems to fit the feedback? But is it a valid word? It might be too obscure.

Another word: ""BACON"" -> B-A-C-O-N. 
- This has B, O, N. 
- But in ""BACON"", we have C at position 3 and N at 5. 
- Check constraints: 
  - C: not at 1 or 5 -> at 3, good. 
  - N: not at 3 or 4 -> at 5, good. 
  - A at 2, fixed. 
- Now, check against feedback: 
  - First guess ""crane"": 
      C at 1: present but wrong position -> in ""BACON"", C is at 3 -> so that's consistent. 
      A at 3: present but wrong position -> in ""BACON"", A is at 2, so the A at 3 in ""crane"" is not matching, but there is an A at 2 -> so it should be marked as present but wrong position -> consistent. 
      N at 4: present but wrong position -> in ""BACON"", N is at 5, so not at 4 -> consistent. 
      R and E absent -> consistent. 
  - Second guess ""panic"": 
      P: absent -> in ""BACON"", no P -> consistent. 
      A: at 2, correct -> consistent. 
      N: at 3 in ""panic"", but in ""BACON"" N is at 5 -> so present but wrong position -> we got N(-) which matches. 
      I: absent -> consistent. 
      C: at 5 in ""panic"", but in ""BACON"" C is at 3 -> so present but wrong position -> we got C(-) which matches. 
- So ""BACON"" is a valid candidate.

Another candidate: ""FANCY"" -> F-A-N-C-Y. 
- But in ""FANCY"", N is at position 3? But we have a constraint that N cannot be at position 3 (from the second guess: N(-) at position 3). So that would be invalid.

Similarly, ""DANCE"" has E -> absent.

""LANCE"" has E -> absent.

""MANGA"" -> M-A-N-G-A. 
- This has duplicate A. 
- But we have M and G. 
- Check: 
  - A at 2: fixed. 
  - N at 3: but we cannot have N at 3 (from second guess feedback) -> invalid.

So back to candidates: ""NACHO"" and ""BACON"".

But we have another case: N at 5 and C at 4: _ A _ C N
Words: 
- ""HAVOC"" -> H-A-V-O-C -> but then N is not present? We need N. 
- ""FACET"" has E and T -> E is absent. 
- ""MACHO"" -> M-A-C-H-O -> but C is at position 3? We need C at position 4. 
  - ""MACHO"" is M-A-C-H-O -> C is at 3, not 4. 
- ""WACKY"" -> W-A-C-K-Y -> C at 3, not 4. 
- ""TACIT"" has I and T -> I is absent. 
- ""RACON"" has R -> absent. 

So not many options. 

Another word: ""BACON"" we already have. 

What about ""CANAL""? But we know C cannot be at position 1 (from first guess). In ""CANAL"", C is at 1 -> invalid.

So the main candidates are ""NACHO"" and ""BACON"".

But we need to choose one for the next guess. We have 4 more guesses, so we can try one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests more new letters to narrow down.

But note: we have only 6 guesses total, and we are on guess 3.

We know the word has A at 2, and contains C and N, and two more letters. The two more letters are either from the remaining alphabet without R,E,P,I.

We can try to think of a word that includes C and N in the allowed positions and two new common letters.

But we have two cases: 
- Case A: N at 1 and C at 3 (like ""NACHO"")
- Case B: N at 5 and C at 3 (like ""BACON"")

We can design a guess that can distinguish between these cases.

For example, if we choose a word that has N at position 1 and C at position 3, then if the secret word is ""BACON"" (which has N at 5 and C at 3), then in our guess:

If we guess ""NACHO"":
- If the secret is ""BACON"", then:
  - N at 1: in ""BACON"", N is at 5, so we would get N(-) meaning present but not at 1.
  - A at 2: correct -> ✓
  - C at 3: in ""BACON"", C is at 3 -> ✓
  - H at 4: absent in ""BACON"" -> x
  - O at 5: in ""BACON"", O is at 4? ""BACON"" is B-A-C-O-N, so O at 4 and N at 5. So O is at 4, not 5 -> so O would be marked as present but wrong position? 
    - But in our guess, O is at 5, and in ""BACON"" O is at 4, so we would get O(-) for position 5.

But we don't know the exact feedback until we guess.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn't commit to one case but tests multiple possibilities.

But we have to include the known letters? Actually, we don't have to. We can guess a word that has A at 2 and then new letters to test.

But we know the word must have C and N, so if we don't include them, we might get feedback that they are present but we won't know the positions. But we already know they are present, so that might not be efficient.

We can try to cover both cases.

Let me think of a word that has A at 2, and then in position 1 we put a letter that might be in the word, and similarly for the others.

But we have limited absent letters.

We can try to use common letters that we haven't tested: like S, T, L, O, U, etc.

But let's list the letters we haven't used: 
- We have used: C, R, A, N, E, P, I (and A is fixed, C and N are present, R,E,P,I absent)
- So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try a word that has A at 2, and then in position 1 we put a letter that, if present, we can know, and similarly.

But we also want to test the position of N and C.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has N at position 1 and C at position 3, like ""NACHO"", and see the feedback. If it's not the word, we get information.

Similarly, we can guess ""BACON"".

But let's choose one that tests more new letters.

Another candidate: for the case with N at 5 and C at 3, we have ""BACON"". For N at 1 and C at 3, we have ""NACHO"". But we can also have other words.

For example, for N at 1 and C at 3: ""NATCH"" (a part of a lock) but not common. ""NACHO"" is better.

For N at 5 and C at 3: ""BACON"", ""TACAN"", ""MACON"" (a city) but ""MACON"" has O and N? M-A-C-O-N -> same as ""BACON"" but with M.

But we don't know if M is present.

We can try ""MANOR"" but R is absent.

I think ""BACON"" and ""NACHO"" are the main candidates.

To decide, we can choose a word that includes both possibilities? But that's hard.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has A at 2, and then in position 5 we put N to test if N is at 5. If we put N at 5 and it turns out to be correct, then we know N is at 5. If it's marked as present but wrong position, then N must be at 1.

Similarly, we can test C at 3.

But we can do both in one guess? 

For example, guess a word with A at 2, N at 5, and C at 3: that would be the pattern _ A C _ N.

But we just saw that for this pattern, we have ""BACON"", ""TACAN"", etc.

But if we guess ""BACON"", then:
- If the secret is ""BACON"", we win.
- If the secret is ""NACHO"", then we get feedback:
   - B: absent (since ""NACHO"" has N at 1, not B)
   - A: correct
   - C: correct (at 3)
   - O: in ""NACHO"", O is at 5, but we have O at 4 in ""BACON"" -> so O would be marked as present but wrong position? 
   - N: at 5 in ""BACON"", but in ""NACHO"" N is at 1 -> so N would be marked as present but wrong position.

But we would know it's not ""BACON"", and then we can guess ""NACHO"" next.

Similarly, if we guess ""NACHO"":
- If the secret is ""NACHO"", we win.
- If the secret is ""BACON"", we get:
   - N at 1: present but wrong position (since in ""BACON"" it's at 5)
   - A: correct
   - C: correct
   - H: absent
   - O: present but wrong position (in ""BACON"" it's at 4)

So in either case, we get two letters correct (A and C) and two letters present but wrong (N and O for ""BACON"" secret, or for ""NACHO"" secret we get A and C correct, and then H absent and O present? Actually, for ""NACHO"" secret, we get:
- N: correct at 1? 
- A: correct at 2
- C: correct at 3
- H: correct at 4? 
- O: correct at 5? 
But if the secret is ""NACHO"", then we get all correct.

But if the secret is ""BACON"", then we get:
- N: present but not at 1 -> because in ""BACON"" N is at 5
- A: correct
- C: correct
- H: absent
- O: present but not at 5 (because in ""BACON"" O is at 4)

So we would get: N(-), A(✓), C(✓), H(x), O(-)

But we don't have that yet.

Given that, I think it's safe to guess one of the candidates.

But we have another possibility: what if the word is not ""NACHO"" or ""BACON""? For example, ""TACAN"" or ""MANOR"" (but ""MANOR"" has R, which is absent) or ""CANTO"" (C at 1, invalid) or ""LANCH"" (not a word).

Another word: ""WACKO"" -> W-A-C-K-O -> but then N is missing? We need N.

So I think ""NACHO"" and ""BACON"" are the most likely.

We can also consider ""HABIT"" but I is absent.

I think we should go with ""BACON"" because it's a common word.

But let's see the feedback we have: in the second guess, we had N at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. In ""BACON"", N is at 5, so that's consistent. In ""NACHO"", N is at 1, which is also consistent.

But in ""NACHO"", we have H and O, which are new. In ""BACON"", we have B and O.

We can try to test for B or H.

But we have to make a guess.

I'll go with ""BACON"" for the next guess.

So the guess is ""BACON"".

But let's double-check the constraints for ""BACON"":
- B: not tested before, so it might be present or absent? But in our guess, we are testing it.
- A: at position 2 -> fixed, so we expect it to be correct.
- C: at position 3 -> we don't know if it's allowed? We only know C cannot be at 1 or 5. Position 3 is allowed.
- O: new letter.
- N: at position 5 -> but we have a constraint that N cannot be at position 4 (from first guess) and cannot be at position 3 (from second guess). Position 5 is allowed.

So it's valid.

Similarly, for ""NACHO"", we have N at 1 (allowed), A at 2 (fixed), C at 3 (allowed), H at 4 (new), O at 5 (new).

Both are valid.

But we have to choose one. I think ""BACON"" is more common.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't commit to either but tests the position of N.

For example, guess a word with A at 2, and N at 1, but not C at 3? But then we are not testing C.

We can guess ""NASTY"": 
- N at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.
- But we know the word must have C, and if we don't include C, then we will get feedback that C is present (because we know it is) but we won't know the position. 
- Also, we might get information about S, T, Y.

But if we guess ""NASTY"", and the secret is ""BACON"", then:
- N at 1: present but wrong position (because in ""BACON"" it's at 5) -> N(-)
- A: correct
- S: absent
- T: absent
- Y: absent
And we know C is present but not in the guess, so we get no position info for C.

Then we know the word has C and N (and A), and we know N is not at 1 (from the feedback of this guess) so N must be at 5. Then C must be at 3 or 4. And we know the word has one more letter (since we have A, C, N, and two more? Actually, we have A, C, N, and two more, but in ""BACON"" we have B and O.

But we don't know the other letter.

This might not be efficient.

So I think it's better to guess one of the candidates.

I'll go with ""BACON"".

<guess>bacon</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane""):**  
  - C is present but not in position 1.  
  - R is absent.  
  - A is present but not in position 3.  
  - N is present but not in position 4.  
  - E is absent.  

- **Guess 2 (""panic""):**  
  - P is absent.  
  - A is correct and in position 2.  
  - N is present but not in position 3.  
  - I is absent.  
  - C is present but not in position 5.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **A is fixed at position 2** (from Guess 2).
2. **C and N are present** but with position constraints:  
   - C cannot be in positions 1 or 5.  
   - N cannot be in positions 3 or 4.  
   - Thus, C must be in position 3 or 4, and N must be in position 1 or 5.  
3. **Absent letters:** R, E, P, I (cannot appear in the word).  
4. The word must contain **two additional letters** (besides A, C, N) from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test a high-likelihood candidate word that fits the constraints and includes common letters to maximize information.  
- **""bacon""** is chosen because:  
  - It places A correctly at position 2.  
  - It positions C at 3 (allowed, since C cannot be at 1 or 5) and N at 5 (allowed, since N cannot be at 3 or 4).  
  - It tests two new common letters: **B** (position 1) and **O** (position 4).  
  - It avoids absent letters (R, E, P, I).  
- If ""bacon"" is correct, the game ends. If not, the feedback will clarify:  
  - Whether B or O are present/absent.  
  - The exact positions of C and N (e.g., if N is marked as present but wrong position, it must be at position 1).  

<guess>bacon</guess>",bacon,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Meaning:
- C is present but not in position 1.
- R is absent.
- A is present but not in position 3.
- N is present but not in position 4.
- E is absent.

Guess 2: ""panic"" -> Feedback: P(x) A(✓) N(-) I(x) C(-)
Meaning:
- P is absent.
- A is correct and in the right position (position 2).
- N is present but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 in ""panic"").
- I is absent.
- C is present but not in position 5.

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word has the letter A in position 2 (from guess 2: A(✓)).
2. The secret word contains the letters: C, A, N (from guess 1 and confirmed in guess 2) and also we know C is still present (from guess 2: C(-)).
3. The secret word does not contain: R, E, P, I (from the x's in both guesses).
4. Position constraints:
   - C cannot be in position 1 (from guess 1) and cannot be in position 5 (from guess 2).
   - N cannot be in position 4 (from guess 1) and cannot be in position 3 (from guess 2).
   - A is fixed at position 2.

We also know that the word has 5 letters, and we have three confirmed letters: A (at position 2), C, and N. But note that there might be more letters we haven't discovered.

Since A is at position 2, and we have C and N to place, and we know two more letters that are absent (P and I), we need to think of words that fit.

Let's list the positions:

Position 1: Cannot be C (from guess1), and we know P is absent so it can't be P. Also, R and E are absent. So position 1 must be a new letter or one of the known present letters (but C is forbidden at pos1). However, we know N is present but we don't know if it can be at position 1? We don't have any constraint that N cannot be at position 1. Similarly, we don't know about other letters.

But note: we have two more positions to fill: positions 3, 4, and 5? Actually, position 2 is fixed as A. So we have positions 1, 3, 4, 5 to fill with the remaining letters.

We know the word must have C and N, and two more letters (since we have 5 letters and we already have A, and then C and N, so two more). But we don't know if there are duplicate letters? The rules don't say the word has distinct letters, but in Wordle, duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, if a letter is repeated, it might be marked accordingly. But so far, we haven't seen any duplicate.

Given the feedback, we can assume for now that there are no duplicates because we haven't encountered any.

So, we have:
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- The word must contain C and N (each exactly once, for now) and two other letters that are not R, E, P, I.

Also, constraints on positions for C and N:
- C cannot be in position 1 or 5 -> so C must be in position 3 or 4.
- N cannot be in position 3 or 4 -> so N must be in position 1 or 5.

But note: position 1 and 5 are the only options for N? And positions 3 and 4 for C.

But wait: if N is at position 1, then C must be at 3 or 4. If N is at position 5, then C must be at 3 or 4.

Now, we also have two more letters to find. They must be letters that are not in the set {R, E, P, I} and not A, C, N (if no duplicates). But A is already placed, so we are looking for two new letters.

Let's think of possible words.

Case 1: N at position 1, and C at position 3 or 4.
- If N at 1, then the word starts with N, then A at 2.
- Then position 3: could be C? But if C is at 3, then we have ""N A C ..."". Then positions 4 and 5 are two new letters.
- Or C at 4: then position 3 is a new letter, then C at 4, then a new letter at 5.

Case 2: N at position 5, and C at position 3 or 4.
- If C at 3: then we have _ A C _ N
- If C at 4: then we have _ A _ C N

Now, we need to fill the blanks with two new letters that are not R, E, P, I.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Let me try to list possible words:

First, for case 1: N at position 1, and C at position 3: ""N A C _ _""
Possible words: 
- ""NACHO"" -> but we know I is absent (from guess2: I(x)), so ""NACHO"" has O? But also, we have H and O. However, we don't know about H and O. But ""NACHO"" has I? No, ""NACHO"" is N-A-C-H-O. So no I. But we have to check if it fits the constraints. 
  - However, in ""NACHO"", C is at position 3? Yes. But in the first guess, C was at position 1 and we know it's not at 1, but now at 3 is allowed. 
  - But in the second guess, we had C at position 5 and we got C(-) meaning C is not at 5. In ""NACHO"", C is at 3, which is not 5, so that's fine. 
  - However, we have a problem: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and we got N(-) meaning N is not at 4. In ""NACHO"", N is at position 1, which is allowed. 
  - But we also have A at position 2, which is fixed. 
  - Now, the issue: we have H and O. Are they allowed? We haven't tested H or O. 
  - But wait, in the second guess, we tested P, A, N, I, C. We know P and I are absent. So H and O are new. 
  - However, we must check if ""NACHO"" is a valid word? Yes.

But we have another constraint: in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and we got A(-) meaning A is in the word but not at 3. In ""NACHO"", A is at position 2, which is correct and we already know that. So that's fine.

But we have a problem: in the second guess, we had N at position 3 and we got N(-) meaning N is not at 3. In ""NACHO"", N is at 1, so that's fine.

However, we are considering C at position 3. In ""NACHO"", C is at position 3. But we have no constraint that C cannot be at 3? Actually, we don't. The constraints for C are: not at 1 and not at 5. So position 3 is allowed.

But wait: in the second guess, we had C at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position (C(-)), so we know C is not at 5. But we don't have any feedback that says C cannot be at 3.

So ""NACHO"" is a candidate? But we must check the feedback we would have gotten for the first guess if the word was ""NACHO"". However, we don't need to because we are building from the feedback.

But note: in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and the feedback for A was A(-) meaning A is present but not at position 3. In ""NACHO"", A is at 2, so that's consistent. Similarly, C is at 3 in ""NACHO"", but in ""crane"" C was at 1 and we got C(-) meaning it's present but not at 1. So that's consistent.

But in the second guess, we had ""panic"" and the feedback for A was A(✓) which matches because A is at 2. For N: in ""panic"" we had N at 3 and we got N(-) meaning N is present but not at 3. In ""NACHO"", N is at 1, so that's consistent. For C: in ""panic"" we had C at 5 and we got C(-) meaning C is present but not at 5. In ""NACHO"", C is at 3, so that's consistent.

And the absent letters: R, E, P, I are not in ""NACHO"". So it fits.

But we have two more cases. Also, we have the case with C at position 4.

But let's see if there are other words.

Another word for case 1: N at 1, C at 4: ""N A _ C _""
What words? ""NAVY"" is 4 letters. ""NARC?"" but R is absent. ""NABC?"" not a word. ""NAHAL""? not common. ""NASTY"" has S and T, but let's see: ""NASTY"" is N-A-S-T-Y. 
- S and T are new. 
- But in ""NASTY"", C is not present? But we know C must be in the word. So that doesn't work.

Similarly, ""NADIR"" has R -> absent. ""NAIAD"" has I -> absent. So no common words for ""N A _ C _"".

Now, case 2: N at position 5, and C at position 3: then we have _ A C _ N
Possible words: 
- ""TACAN"" (a navigation system) -> but T is new, and then the fourth letter? ""TACAN"" is T-A-C-A-N -> but that has two A's? 
  - Let's check: positions: T(1), A(2), C(3), A(4), N(5). 
  - But we have two A's. The feedback from the first guess: we had A at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. In ""TACAN"", there is an A at position 2 (fixed) and at position 4. 
  - The feedback for the first guess would have marked the A as present (because there is at least one A) but since the first guess had A at position 3 and in the secret word there is an A at 2 and 4, then the feedback for the first guess would have marked the A as present but not at 3? Actually, it would. But also, the duplicate: the feedback doesn't specify which A. 
  - However, in the second guess, we had A at position 2 and it was correct, so that A is fixed. Now, if there is another A at position 4, that would be acceptable. 
  - But we don't have any feedback that says there is a duplicate. 
  - However, in the second guess, we only tested one A (at position 2) and it was correct. We didn't test position 4. 
  - But the problem is: in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. In ""TACAN"", the A at position 3 is not present (because the A's are at 2 and 4). So the feedback for the first guess would have marked the A as absent? But that's not what happened. We got A(-) meaning present but wrong position. 
  - Therefore, if the secret word is ""TACAN"", then in the first guess ""crane"", the A at position 3: the secret word has A at 2 and 4, so the A in ""crane"" at 3 is not matching, but there is an A in the word (at 2 and 4) so it should be marked as present but wrong position. So that's consistent. 
  - Now, in the second guess ""panic"": 
      P (absent) -> correct, 
      A at 2 (correct) -> marked as correct, 
      N at 3: in ""TACAN"", position 3 is C, so N is not at 3 -> but we have N in the word at position 5, so it should be marked as present but wrong position? But in the feedback we got N(-) for ""panic"", which means present but wrong position. 
      I (absent) -> correct, 
      C at 5: in ""TACAN"", C is at 3, so not at 5 -> so it should be marked as present but wrong position? And we got C(-) for that. 
  - So ""TACAN"" seems to fit the feedback? But is it a valid word? It might be too obscure.

Another word: ""BACON"" -> B-A-C-O-N. 
- This has B, O, N. 
- But in ""BACON"", we have C at position 3 and N at 5. 
- Check constraints: 
  - C: not at 1 or 5 -> at 3, good. 
  - N: not at 3 or 4 -> at 5, good. 
  - A at 2, fixed. 
- Now, check against feedback: 
  - First guess ""crane"": 
      C at 1: present but wrong position -> in ""BACON"", C is at 3 -> so that's consistent. 
      A at 3: present but wrong position -> in ""BACON"", A is at 2, so the A at 3 in ""crane"" is not matching, but there is an A at 2 -> so it should be marked as present but wrong position -> consistent. 
      N at 4: present but wrong position -> in ""BACON"", N is at 5, so not at 4 -> consistent. 
      R and E absent -> consistent. 
  - Second guess ""panic"": 
      P: absent -> in ""BACON"", no P -> consistent. 
      A: at 2, correct -> consistent. 
      N: at 3 in ""panic"", but in ""BACON"" N is at 5 -> so present but wrong position -> we got N(-) which matches. 
      I: absent -> consistent. 
      C: at 5 in ""panic"", but in ""BACON"" C is at 3 -> so present but wrong position -> we got C(-) which matches. 
- So ""BACON"" is a valid candidate.

Another candidate: ""FANCY"" -> F-A-N-C-Y. 
- But in ""FANCY"", N is at position 3? But we have a constraint that N cannot be at position 3 (from the second guess: N(-) at position 3). So that would be invalid.

Similarly, ""DANCE"" has E -> absent.

""LANCE"" has E -> absent.

""MANGA"" -> M-A-N-G-A. 
- This has duplicate A. 
- But we have M and G. 
- Check: 
  - A at 2: fixed. 
  - N at 3: but we cannot have N at 3 (from second guess feedback) -> invalid.

So back to candidates: ""NACHO"" and ""BACON"".

But we have another case: N at 5 and C at 4: _ A _ C N
Words: 
- ""HAVOC"" -> H-A-V-O-C -> but then N is not present? We need N. 
- ""FACET"" has E and T -> E is absent. 
- ""MACHO"" -> M-A-C-H-O -> but C is at position 3? We need C at position 4. 
  - ""MACHO"" is M-A-C-H-O -> C is at 3, not 4. 
- ""WACKY"" -> W-A-C-K-Y -> C at 3, not 4. 
- ""TACIT"" has I and T -> I is absent. 
- ""RACON"" has R -> absent. 

So not many options. 

Another word: ""BACON"" we already have. 

What about ""CANAL""? But we know C cannot be at position 1 (from first guess). In ""CANAL"", C is at 1 -> invalid.

So the main candidates are ""NACHO"" and ""BACON"".

But we need to choose one for the next guess. We have 4 more guesses, so we can try one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests more new letters to narrow down.

But note: we have only 6 guesses total, and we are on guess 3.

We know the word has A at 2, and contains C and N, and two more letters. The two more letters are either from the remaining alphabet without R,E,P,I.

We can try to think of a word that includes C and N in the allowed positions and two new common letters.

But we have two cases: 
- Case A: N at 1 and C at 3 (like ""NACHO"")
- Case B: N at 5 and C at 3 (like ""BACON"")

We can design a guess that can distinguish between these cases.

For example, if we choose a word that has N at position 1 and C at position 3, then if the secret word is ""BACON"" (which has N at 5 and C at 3), then in our guess:

If we guess ""NACHO"":
- If the secret is ""BACON"", then:
  - N at 1: in ""BACON"", N is at 5, so we would get N(-) meaning present but not at 1.
  - A at 2: correct -> ✓
  - C at 3: in ""BACON"", C is at 3 -> ✓
  - H at 4: absent in ""BACON"" -> x
  - O at 5: in ""BACON"", O is at 4? ""BACON"" is B-A-C-O-N, so O at 4 and N at 5. So O is at 4, not 5 -> so O would be marked as present but wrong position? 
    - But in our guess, O is at 5, and in ""BACON"" O is at 4, so we would get O(-) for position 5.

But we don't know the exact feedback until we guess.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn't commit to one case but tests multiple possibilities.

But we have to include the known letters? Actually, we don't have to. We can guess a word that has A at 2 and then new letters to test.

But we know the word must have C and N, so if we don't include them, we might get feedback that they are present but we won't know the positions. But we already know they are present, so that might not be efficient.

We can try to cover both cases.

Let me think of a word that has A at 2, and then in position 1 we put a letter that might be in the word, and similarly for the others.

But we have limited absent letters.

We can try to use common letters that we haven't tested: like S, T, L, O, U, etc.

But let's list the letters we haven't used: 
- We have used: C, R, A, N, E, P, I (and A is fixed, C and N are present, R,E,P,I absent)
- So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try a word that has A at 2, and then in position 1 we put a letter that, if present, we can know, and similarly.

But we also want to test the position of N and C.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has N at position 1 and C at position 3, like ""NACHO"", and see the feedback. If it's not the word, we get information.

Similarly, we can guess ""BACON"".

But let's choose one that tests more new letters.

Another candidate: for the case with N at 5 and C at 3, we have ""BACON"". For N at 1 and C at 3, we have ""NACHO"". But we can also have other words.

For example, for N at 1 and C at 3: ""NATCH"" (a part of a lock) but not common. ""NACHO"" is better.

For N at 5 and C at 3: ""BACON"", ""TACAN"", ""MACON"" (a city) but ""MACON"" has O and N? M-A-C-O-N -> same as ""BACON"" but with M.

But we don't know if M is present.

We can try ""MANOR"" but R is absent.

I think ""BACON"" and ""NACHO"" are the main candidates.

To decide, we can choose a word that includes both possibilities? But that's hard.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has A at 2, and then in position 5 we put N to test if N is at 5. If we put N at 5 and it turns out to be correct, then we know N is at 5. If it's marked as present but wrong position, then N must be at 1.

Similarly, we can test C at 3.

But we can do both in one guess? 

For example, guess a word with A at 2, N at 5, and C at 3: that would be the pattern _ A C _ N.

But we just saw that for this pattern, we have ""BACON"", ""TACAN"", etc.

But if we guess ""BACON"", then:
- If the secret is ""BACON"", we win.
- If the secret is ""NACHO"", then we get feedback:
   - B: absent (since ""NACHO"" has N at 1, not B)
   - A: correct
   - C: correct (at 3)
   - O: in ""NACHO"", O is at 5, but we have O at 4 in ""BACON"" -> so O would be marked as present but wrong position? 
   - N: at 5 in ""BACON"", but in ""NACHO"" N is at 1 -> so N would be marked as present but wrong position.

But we would know it's not ""BACON"", and then we can guess ""NACHO"" next.

Similarly, if we guess ""NACHO"":
- If the secret is ""NACHO"", we win.
- If the secret is ""BACON"", we get:
   - N at 1: present but wrong position (since in ""BACON"" it's at 5)
   - A: correct
   - C: correct
   - H: absent
   - O: present but wrong position (in ""BACON"" it's at 4)

So in either case, we get two letters correct (A and C) and two letters present but wrong (N and O for ""BACON"" secret, or for ""NACHO"" secret we get A and C correct, and then H absent and O present? Actually, for ""NACHO"" secret, we get:
- N: correct at 1? 
- A: correct at 2
- C: correct at 3
- H: correct at 4? 
- O: correct at 5? 
But if the secret is ""NACHO"", then we get all correct.

But if the secret is ""BACON"", then we get:
- N: present but not at 1 -> because in ""BACON"" N is at 5
- A: correct
- C: correct
- H: absent
- O: present but not at 5 (because in ""BACON"" O is at 4)

So we would get: N(-), A(✓), C(✓), H(x), O(-)

But we don't have that yet.

Given that, I think it's safe to guess one of the candidates.

But we have another possibility: what if the word is not ""NACHO"" or ""BACON""? For example, ""TACAN"" or ""MANOR"" (but ""MANOR"" has R, which is absent) or ""CANTO"" (C at 1, invalid) or ""LANCH"" (not a word).

Another word: ""WACKO"" -> W-A-C-K-O -> but then N is missing? We need N.

So I think ""NACHO"" and ""BACON"" are the most likely.

We can also consider ""HABIT"" but I is absent.

I think we should go with ""BACON"" because it's a common word.

But let's see the feedback we have: in the second guess, we had N at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. In ""BACON"", N is at 5, so that's consistent. In ""NACHO"", N is at 1, which is also consistent.

But in ""NACHO"", we have H and O, which are new. In ""BACON"", we have B and O.

We can try to test for B or H.

But we have to make a guess.

I'll go with ""BACON"" for the next guess.

So the guess is ""BACON"".

But let's double-check the constraints for ""BACON"":
- B: not tested before, so it might be present or absent? But in our guess, we are testing it.
- A: at position 2 -> fixed, so we expect it to be correct.
- C: at position 3 -> we don't know if it's allowed? We only know C cannot be at 1 or 5. Position 3 is allowed.
- O: new letter.
- N: at position 5 -> but we have a constraint that N cannot be at position 4 (from first guess) and cannot be at position 3 (from second guess). Position 5 is allowed.

So it's valid.

Similarly, for ""NACHO"", we have N at 1 (allowed), A at 2 (fixed), C at 3 (allowed), H at 4 (new), O at 5 (new).

Both are valid.

But we have to choose one. I think ""BACON"" is more common.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't commit to either but tests the position of N.

For example, guess a word with A at 2, and N at 1, but not C at 3? But then we are not testing C.

We can guess ""NASTY"": 
- N at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.
- But we know the word must have C, and if we don't include C, then we will get feedback that C is present (because we know it is) but we won't know the position. 
- Also, we might get information about S, T, Y.

But if we guess ""NASTY"", and the secret is ""BACON"", then:
- N at 1: present but wrong position (because in ""BACON"" it's at 5) -> N(-)
- A: correct
- S: absent
- T: absent
- Y: absent
And we know C is present but not in the guess, so we get no position info for C.

Then we know the word has C and N (and A), and we know N is not at 1 (from the feedback of this guess) so N must be at 5. Then C must be at 3 or 4. And we know the word has one more letter (since we have A, C, N, and two more? Actually, we have A, C, N, and two more, but in ""BACON"" we have B and O.

But we don't know the other letter.

This might not be efficient.

So I think it's better to guess one of the candidates.

I'll go with ""BACON"".

<guess>bacon</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane""):**  
  - C is present but not in position 1.  
  - R is absent.  
  - A is present but not in position 3.  
  - N is present but not in position 4.  
  - E is absent.  

- **Guess 2 (""panic""):**  
  - P is absent.  
  - A is correct and in position 2.  
  - N is present but not in position 3.  
  - I is absent.  
  - C is present but not in position 5.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **A is fixed at position 2** (from Guess 2).
2. **C and N are present** but with position constraints:  
   - C cannot be in positions 1 or 5.  
   - N cannot be in positions 3 or 4.  
   - Thus, C must be in position 3 or 4, and N must be in position 1 or 5.  
3. **Absent letters:** R, E, P, I (cannot appear in the word).  
4. The word must contain **two additional letters** (besides A, C, N) from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test a high-likelihood candidate word that fits the constraints and includes common letters to maximize information.  
- **""bacon""** is chosen because:  
  - It places A correctly at position 2.  
  - It positions C at 3 (allowed, since C cannot be at 1 or 5) and N at 5 (allowed, since N cannot be at 3 or 4).  
  - It tests two new common letters: **B** (position 1) and **O** (position 4).  
  - It avoids absent letters (R, E, P, I).  
- If ""bacon"" is correct, the game ends. If not, the feedback will clarify:  
  - Whether B or O are present/absent.  
  - The exact positions of C and N (e.g., if N is marked as present but wrong position, it must be at position 1).",Guess 3: bacon -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) A(✓) C(✓) O(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
